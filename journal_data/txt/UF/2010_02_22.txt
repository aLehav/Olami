Annual step show brings 5,000 to O'Dome
By SARAH JACKSON
Alligator Contributing Writer
Audience members sang along
as nine members of Iota Phi Theta
wore vests and combat boots and
danced to "You Belong With Me"
by Taylor Swift at the 21st annual
Florida Invitational Step Show.
Iota Phi Theta was the winning
fraternity step team, and Sigma
Gamma Rho won first place for
sororities at the competition
Saturday night in the O'Connell
Center.
Kappa Alpha Psi placed sec-
ond place for the fraternities and
Zeta Phi Beta placed second for
the sororities.
The nine judges were former
members of participating sorori-
ties and fraternities.
Letticia Etti, an industrial en-
gineering sophomore, said she
was impressed with Iota Phi The-
ta's performance, which included
a parody of the "Bad Boys" mov-
ies and about four dances.
"Iota was real creative," Etti
said. "They show their pride, andit was well put together."
Pop culture references were a
popular trend, but the Alpha Phi
Alpha fraternity team chose the
theme of working on a plantation
instead.
The members came out in tat-
tered clothes, and their "master,"
wearing white face-paint, kept
trying to stop them from danc-
ing.
"Iota was real creative.
They show their pride, and
it was well put together."
Letticia Etti
UF sophomore
Etti, an audience member, said
having the performer wear white
face paint was a bold move, but
adding the segment was a contro-
versial decision.
She said she thought people
would be offended by it.
The Sigma Gamma Rho step
team called themselves "Sigma-
tars" and twirled blue and gold

Bus drivers face off
By MINCH MINCHIN
Alligator Writer
Saturday was a bad day to be a
tennis ball, orange cone or traffic
drum.
About 60 people gathered on the
driving pad behind the Gainesville
Regional Airport Saturday morning
to watch some of Gainesville's most
daring bus drivers compete in the
12th Annual Regional Transit Sys-
tem Bus Roadeo.
Four Gainesville RTS drivers
participated in the large obstacle
course, which at times looked more
like a demolition derby.
In his race around the track,
Roadeo winner Eddie Bishop onlydestroyed or knocked over a hand-
ful of cones, barrels and balls, an ac-
complishment that will send him to
the statewide bus-driving competi-
tion in Orlando next month.
Winners at the state tournament
receive cash prizes and get invita-
Around tions to partici-
Gainesville pate in national
and even interna-
tional bus-driving
competitions, he said.
Though navigating the tennis
ball gauntlet was hard enough, the
state-level competition is probably
going to be more difficult, Bishop
said.
"[The state level] is probably go-
ing to be some crazy stuff," he said.J. Hunter Sizemore/ Alligator Staff

1 Machen: More cuts to come
-HE INTRODUCED A PLAN TO
INCREASE PERCENTAGE OF OUT-OF-
STATE STUDENTS.
By MATT HARRINGER
Alligator Writer
UF President Bernie Machen had an im-
portant message for the Board of Trustees
Friday: Prepare for cuts.
The university has already eliminated
$140 million from its budget during the last
three years, but Machen said the speaker of
the house and Senate president have told
him there will be more budget cuts in the
coming year.
Machen warned 2011-2012 will be the
worst academic year because UF will have
used $40 million in funding from the fed-
eral stimulus.
Senior Vice President of Administration
Brian Beach presented a plan that wouldannually cut enrollment by 5.6 percent.
It would also raise tuition by 15 percent
and raise the salaries of UF faculty 3 per-
cent.
The plan would still cause UF to run a
budget deficit of tens of millions of dollars
until 2014.
Exactly how many millions depends on
Machen
of state.how much the legislature
cuts university funding.
Machen said UF would
also ask the legislature
to make some policy
changes to create revenue
for the university. That
would include increasing
the percentage of students
who come to UF from out
"It could easily get worse before it gets
better," W.A. "Mac" McGriff, chairman of
the Board of Trustees, said about the state's
budget crisis. "A lot worse."
0 UF catcher Mike
Zunino hit a walk-
off single in the bot-
tom of 10th inning
to give the Gators
a 7-6 win Sunday
and complete their
season-opening
sweep of USF in
Gainesville.

GPD study highlights accidents involving pedestrians
West University Avenue has most dangerous intersections
By MELINDA CARSTENSEN
Alligator Contributing Writer
Mother always said look both ways be-
fore crossing the street.
Now, the Gainesville Police Depart-
ment is urging pedestrians to do the same
thing after a recent study concluded there
are about three traffic accidents involving
pedestrians every week.
The most dangerous intersections for
pedestrians are West University Avenue
and Northwest 17th street and Northwest
13th Street and 23rd Avenue, according to
a 2007 to 2009 GPD database.
GPD Cpl. Tscharna Senn said cross-
walks have been repainted and made more
visible since the study.Likewise, she said the department has
created and distributed brochures that de-
tail different types of traffic violations and
how to avoid getting one.
According to the safety brochure, Flor-
ida law requires drivers to yield to pe-
destrians at a crosswalk even when there
are no pavement markings, drivers may
not pass other drivers at a crosswalk and
turning vehicles must yield to a pedestrian
crossing on a green light or at the "walk"
signal.
"We're not trying to go out and write a
bunch of tickets that may or may not get
people to actually learn the law," Senn
said. "And we want them to actually
learn."
Senn advised pedestrians and drivers"We're not trying to go out and
write a bunch of tickets that may
or may not get people to actually
learn the law. And we want them
to actually learn."
Tscharna Senn
GPD Cpl.
to simply pay attention while on roads.
And while Senn stressed pedestrian ac-
cidents usually involve fault from both the
driver and the pedestrian, she reminded
Gainesville residents many of these acci-
dents could have been prevented.
"You shouldn't be on the phone, tex-ting, fumbling with the radio, the comput-
or GPS. Your eyes should be forward
and focusing on driving," she said.
Although Senn said there is no law
against texting while driving, she advised
drivers to put their phones down while
driving to avoid accidents.
"Anytime you're distracted from the
road, then you're increasing your likeli-
hood of being involved in a crash."
Senn said the need for drivers and pe-
destrians to be alert is even more important
in a college town like Gainesville, where
people frequently cross busy intersections
throughout the day.
"We have a lot of traffic, and people
like to walk," she said. "When you have a
lot of people walk in a small area, you're
going to have the potential to have more
crashes."

Car show raises money for charity
By ROXANNE FRASER
Contributing Writer
A white 1991 Audi sedan was
nestled among expensive sports
cars and flashy trucks on theCommuter Parking Lot behind
Hume parking garage.
Underneath the hood of the
sedan was a five-cylinder engine
that could compete with the en-
gine of a sports car.

An attendee of the SwampFest 2010 car, truck and bike show pass-
es by one of the show cars Saturday afternoon."I like the idea of having a car
-like you could have a grandpa
driving it -and it could blow the
doors off a Lamborghini," said
Chris Gregg, a mechanical engi-
neering junior who built most of
the parts.
The American Society of
Mechanical Engineers hosted
SwampFest 2010, the fourth an-
nual UF car, truck and motorcy-
cle show Saturday from 2 p.m. to
8 p.m., and between 200 and 250
people stopped by to check out
a group of about 60 cars, trucks
and motorcycles.
Participants won awards for
their vehicles in 20 categories
ranging from Best Domestic Old
Car to Best Junk. The prizes fea-
tured car roof reupholstery and
window tinting.
The event raised money for
the Muscular Dystrophy As-
sociation, and this year half the
proceeds will go toward Gators
United for Haiti.
Organizers are still calculating
the amount of money raised and
will know the total by Thursday.

U ., rCouples tango at
Haiti fundraiser
By PAIGE LACY
Alligator Contributing Writer
It took more than two to tango at a Haiti relief fundraiser
Sunday night when about 21 couples raised more than $700
during a dance at the UF Hillel.
Richard Cepeda, the UF Argentine Tango Club president,
said all of the money collected will be donated to the American
Red Cross Haiti relief fund.
"We wanted to host an event where people could have fun
and donate to a good cause," Cepeda said.
Ha iti Tango for Haiti was organized by the UF Ar-
Relief gentine Tango Club and UF Hillel. The event in-
cluded tango workshops and special performanc-
es by club members.
Valery Bonbon, a civil engineering senior, said she has seen
the Argentine tango before, but this is her first trying the steps.
"I was never brave enough to take lessons until this event,"
Bonbon said.
After the workshops ended, couples began gliding across
the dance floor.
Burcin Unel, a tango instructor, said the most important
part of learning the tango is the connection.
"A connection to a partner, to the music and dance floor is
essential," Unel said. "The connection is more important than
perfecting the steps."

UF students puck off at underwater hockey clinic
Team ranked fourth overall in national competition
By STEFANIA FERRO
Alligator Contributing Writer
With fins on her feet for the first time,
Veronica Kwiatkowski dove into the Flori-
da Pool and searched for a hockey puck.
The biology sophomore was one of 24
who attended the UF Underwater Hockey
team's clinic Saturday at the Florida Pool.
Using sticks about 1 foot long, under-
water hockey players push pucks across
the pool's bottom and try shooting them
into the opposing team's underwater goal
at the end of the pool, according to the
team's Web site.
Each team has six players equipped
with sticks, goggles, snorkels and head-
gear.
Rafael Seminario, the club's president,
said the UF team ranks fourth overall inthe national competition, and it's the only
college underwater hockey club ranked in
the "A" division for the sport.
Seminario has been playing for almost
two years.
Although underwater hockey is a non-
contact sport, he said he still gets the same
workout he would playing basketball.
Some members of the Swordfish Un-
derwater Hockey club at Georgia Tech, in-
cluding Nicole Mazouchova, came to the
clinic to get more practice.
Mazouchova, 28, president of the
Swordfish club, said she learned about the
sport while studying in Canada.
She created the Swordfish team in 2008
and the team now has between 20 and 25
members.
To gain more experience, her team vid-
eotapes practices to improve their strategyin the sport.
She said she would like to send some of
the team's players to national and world
underwater hockey competitions in the
future.
But UF player Keely Kilduff said new
competitors may have trouble adjusting to
the sport.
Kilduff, an animal sciences sophomore,
has been playing underwater
On hockey for two weeks.
She said the hardest part
for new players is breathing
with a snorkel.
Andrei Savu, 28, a player on the Geor-
gia Tech team, said there are two types of
people: Those who are comfortable with
the snorkel and those who are not.
He said new players should attend a set
number of practices before giving up onthe sport.
"Don't judge until you've been here
three times," he said.
Andre Thomas, the vice president of
the UF team, has been playing the sport
for more than four years.
He said the team fosters friendships.
"The underwater hockey community is
very close-knit," he said.
Rules of Underwater Hockey
1. Play is on the bottom of the pool, so
effectiveness is governed by how much
time is spent on the bottom
2. No body contact unless your stick is on
the puck
3. The person in control of the puck
cannot be pushed
4. Passing is done by throwing the puck off
your stick with a flick of your wrist
Local kids take a hike
By TYLER JETT
Alligator Writer
Eric Thompson looked down, his
white Nike shoes barely safe from
the mud.
While hiking through Prairie
Creek Preserve, Eric, 9, was looking
for wildlife amid the trees, leaves
and log walkways.
Eric and four classmates from
Lake Forest Elementary School ex-
plored the Prairie Creek Preserve
Saturday as part of Take A Hike,
Florida!, an event created for the
Florida Forever program.
The hike at Prairie Creek was one
of 12 walks throughout Florida Sat-
urday. Florida Forever is an organi-
zation that purchases and preserves
land in the state.
For the first time in more than
20 years, Florida Forever did not re-
ceive funding from the state legisla-
ture after the budget was created.
Gov. Charlie Crist suggested
the legislature give the organiza-
tion about $5 million next year, butmembers of Florida Forever want
residents to write legislatures to en-
sure it receives the money.
Eric and other Lake Forest stu-
dents who hiked participated as
part of Gainesville's Inner City Out-
ings program, which was created by
the Sierra Club. The group's goal is
to bring children on outdoor adven-
tures, said Maryvonne Devensky,
the program's chairwoman.
Devensky said she is passionate
about the program because it gives
children a chance to explore the out-
doors, which is something she thinks
most do not do often enough.
When Eric got to Prairie Creek
around 9:30 a.m., he told adults he
was looking for an alligator.
"I want to see a huge one," he
said, spreading his arms as wide as
he could.
But Eric did not see any alliga-
tors. Devensky said the Lake Forest
students' loud noises might have
scared the animals.
"We have to train them to be qui-
et," she said.City Arborist Meg Hutchinson and others lead the Inner City Outings program on a hike in Rochelle Sat-
urday afternoon.

Split Ticket
after a very, very long afternoon in a sauna -we
mean office -of niceties from politicos in training
and conversation after conversation about the Reitz
Union's renovation and expansion, we'd like to present you
with our spring 2010 endorsement. Hold onto your hats, ladies
and gentlemen, because this endorsement may surprise you.
Unlike U.S. presidential elections, SG tickets are not inex-
tricably fused. Students cast a separate vote for treasurer than
president and vice president. So we chose the candidates -not
the party -we felt would best represent students.
We have chosen not to endorse a candidate for Student Body
president because both Unite Party candidate Ashton Charles
and Student Alliance party candidate Ben Cavataro are quali-
fied, well-versed in Student Government and hard workers.
After talking to both of these candidates, it was clear that either
would do well in office, and we trust them both.
Charles is the Senate President and has experience working
with the administration. She is a powerful speaker with a natu-
ral gift for engaging people, and she is sincere and motivated.
Cavataro, who is just as experienced as Charles in networking
and public service, is the president of Florida College Demo-
crats, proving his determination and ability to succeed in the
public eye. He has proven he genuinely cares about the Student
Body and will fight to stand up for the good of UF students.
Both are in favor of putting voting records and budget de-
tails online, being true advocates on behalf of the student voice
in front of the Board of Trustees and making the goings-on of
SG generally more transparent. The Editorial Board believes
students should decide which candidate they would be com-
fortable and proud to have represent them.
When it comes to the other positions and issues we were able
to make decisions.
The Editorial Board endorses Student Alliance party can-
didate Sagar Sane for Student Body vice president. His ideas
on creating an endowment fund that would take Accent and
Student Government Productions off of Student Activity and
Service Fees (money taken out of our tuition) and making them
self-sustaining entities is innovative and economically savvy.
Furthermore, it would allow the more than $1 million used to
fund those organizations be spent elsewhere, like funding stu-
dent groups. Sane already set up a fund like this from scratch
at his previous school, which gives us peace of mind and confi-
dence that he'll be able to do it here successfully.
As for Student Body treasurer, the Editorial Board is going
to pick the candidate with the most experience, and Unite Party
candidate Virlany Taboada has plenty of it. She is the chair-
woman of the Senate's Budget and Appropriations Committee,
which means she deals with SG's budget on a daily basis. She
supports a more transparent SG budget, which will always pull
at our heartstrings.
There's one referendum question that has caused a lot of
talk. First of all, keep in mind that a referendum question is like
a survey, it's only to measure students' opinions, not take any
action. The Editorial Board. drum roll please. is endorsing the
renovation and expansion of the Reitz Union. Its clear the union
has seen better days, and it's going to cost $42.5 million to fix it.
There are still utilities that have been there since 1967.
Now, before you crumple up the paper and throw it away
in anger, you should know students aren't going to be the only
people funding the new union. Reitz advocates will be seeking
out money from the Capital Improvement Trust Fund, which
is currently funding Southwest Rec Center's renovation, and
alumni donations. The proposed dollar amounts aren't set in
stone and could even be lower. The new union could have more
meeting space student organizations need, more parking, far
more study space and a 1,500 person auditorium. These are all
things UF needs and our current union lacks.
However, our support of the expansion is conditional and
hinges on one important point: We're only in favor if SG keeps
its promise to do everything it can to make sure graduate as-
sistants do not pay the fee.
See you at the polls! (Seriously, we'd better see you there.)

Celebrities held to double standards
n issue that plagued me considerably last year hasrecently resurfaced with the addition of wide re-
ceiver Dont6 Stallworth to the roster of the NFL's
Baltimore Ravens. Stallworth, who nabbed passes for the
Cleveland Browns during the 2008 season, was arrested
in March of 2009 and charged with DUI manslaughter af-
ter hitting 59-year-old Mario Reyes. This event garnered a
modest amount of media coverage and paled in compari-
son to the circus surrounding the Michael Vick case. It's
this disparity in coverage and, more specifically, public
outrage that's at the root of my dismay.
Vick, as we're all well aware, pleaded guilty to funding,
operating and taking part in dog fighting, most notably the
inhumane killing of six to eight underachieving dogs with
two of his accomplices, according to court documents.
Stallworth had been doing 50 in a 40 with his Blood Al-
cohol Content at more than 0.12. Reyes was rushing to catch
a bus after work when he was struck by Stallworth's Bent-
ley. (In his defense, Stallworth thoughtfully flashed his lights
several times before plowing into Reyes.)
I can understand the severity of Vick's punishment -
nearly two years and perhaps nine figures' worth -but I'm
absolutely dumbfounded with regards to the leniency Stall-
worth received. Reyes was deemed partially at fault for not
being in a crosswalk, and there was further leniency shown
toward Stallworth for both flashing his lights and being
compliant with officers and taking full responsibility for the
crash. First of all, instead of flashing his lights, why did he
not, I don't know, try swerving and slamming on his brakes?
After all, he wasn't driving a Toyota. Secondly, why is he be-
ing rewarded for simply not making things worse? Owning
up to one's actions should not be considered going "above
and beyond." (What could he have done otherwise, pull a
Jamie Foxx and blame it on the alcohol?) I mean, if I go out
to get plastered tonight and smash into somebody driving
home, I'm toast; it's a wrap for me. The only thing I'll have toworry about is not fumbling the soap,
followed by a long, lonely stint work-
ing at CVS until I'm eighty.
All said and done, Vick served
_nealy a month of mixed incarceration
(federal, state and house arrest) for ev-
Ryan Spencer ery day Stallworth served in jail -23
letters@a Iligator org months versus 24 days.
So on one hand we have Vick, who's
largely considered to be the Animal
Antichrist, and on the other we have Stallworth, who, well,
doesn't really have any sort of stigma weighing him down.
This inconsistency can't simply be a function of their pre-in-
cident status -no, not in the same country that has rocketed
to stardom the likes of Sarah Palin, Speidi and Mario Lopez.
Moreover, Stallworth's accident is precisely the kind of event
for which he could be remembered in infamy, and yet he re-
mains under the radar. Where's the trial by fire we've grown
accustom to? It was ruthlessly easy in Vick's case given the
animals involved, but there was relative silence when it was
a person whom Stallworth killed. Do Vick's 2.33 dogs really
overshadow Stallworth's single person?
It seems the word "accident" is likely the root of the prob-
lem here. Vick's actions are seen as manifestations of some in-
ner malevolence representative of Vick himself. Stallworth's
"accident," on the other hand, is seen as a product of circum-
stance. However, if I were to claim Vick's actions were direct
results of his upbringing and culture, I would be bombarded
with retorts about choice, responsibility, etc. Similarly, Stall-
worth must be held to the same standard, especially given
the fact that he was in a position to have a driver for every
time he left his home, let alone every time he drank. He liter-
ally invites this event to happen, albeit not specifically with
Reyes, and ends up more or less getting a free pass -he is
who we thought he was, and we let him off the hook.

Letters to the Editor
Students should take a stand against
hate act
I hope that I am joined by the entire uni-
versity community in condemning the most
recent incident of hate speech on our cam-
pus. For those of you who do not know,
fliers were distributed across campus and
around Gainesville that said, "Student Alli-
ance party is the Nazi Party," printing our
logo and a swastika with an equal sign be-
tween them.
I am disgusted individuals who stand
against us, individuals who have used the
deaths of millions for political ends, have
resulted to such cowardly and despicable
tactics. If you have any information about
who committed this act, I beg you to come
forward now. Finding the truth in this mat-
ter is the first step to healing our campus in
the aftermath of this entire ordeal.
As a Jew, a member of the Student Alli-
ance and a UF student, I am extremely of-
fended by these actions. We all need to stand
against this example of bigotry and hate and
we must come together as students. I urge
you all to stay strong, even in the face of this
vile act. As one voice, we can drown out the
hate on this campus and work together for
our university's future.

Dove World Outreach Center should be
forced off campus
Members of the Dove World Outreach
Center should be forced off campus by
students and faculty alike. Gainesville resi-
dents should not tolerate blatant prejudice,
whether it be on billboards or T-shirts. The
message needs to be simple and direct: The
Dove World Outreach Center does not be-long on campus and does not belong on the
streets. The hateful messages should be kept
inside their festering warehouse of Bibles
and screen-printing presses. When citizens
become indifferent to religiously or cultur-
ally incendiary messages, evil will triumph.
Everyone needs to know that genocide be-
gins when lay people tolerate bigotry. If
members of the Dove Center can walk freely
though campus, student and faculty silence
is directly condoning their message. When
did the Holocaust begin? Did it begin when
the first victims died? When theywere put on
trains? The Holocaust began when a whole
people became desensitized to violence and
apathetic to racism. The Dove Center is us-
ing religious text to try to label and isolate
Islamic people. If this sounds familiar, join
me and force the members of this wretched
group off our campus and off our streets.

Administrators make reforms, not SG
Jordan Johnson and Hitler: Are they the
same? Ben Meyers: Could he be our genera-
tion's Joseph Goebbels? Is Ashton Charles
the next Rudolf Hess?
Obviously, the answer to these ques-
tions is "no." These Nazis committed crimes
against humanity and are some of the most
evil characters man has ever produced. A
Student Government politician could hardly
warrant such infamy. However, such a com-
parison does pose some valid questions. Do
these Unite figures represent an oppressive
regime that has single-handedly ruled SG
for years? Absolutely. Have they pushed
through their own fascist agenda with no re-
gard for the will of the people? Thousands of
dollars spent on "necessary" perks each yearscream "yes." Most importantly, do any of
these politicians deserve your support? Not
unless they earn it, and so far, all of SG has
been phoning it in. List off achievements
until you're blue in the face, but it doesn't
change the fact that most of those reforms
that SG made over the past year were actu-
ally made by UF administrators. SG simply
rubber-stamped them through. The constant
word wars and positioning that happen on
these pages disgust me. Every day, SG at UF
proves that it is nothing more than a mouth-
piece, and, while that does make them the
perfect complement to the codpiece that our
administration so frequently resembles, the
blame games are not helping students.
Hear my words, SG horde. Bow down in
front of your leaders. Kiss their golden rings
and jockey for their favor. Enjoy the empty
congratulations and promises they feed you.
But know, when the SG Nuremberg comes,
Joe Voter -with his beer in hand -will
not care how many asses you kissed or how
many voters you coerced when he decides
to send you to the gallows.

Greek philanthropies not egotistical
Philanthropies are a chance for the Greek
community as a whole, and the houses in-
dividually, to provide charitable service to
their communities through the power of col-
lective action. It's hard to believe that such
an altruistic goal could be smeared or tar-
nished, yet recent commentary in the Alliga-
tor has proved otherwise.
In a letter to the editor earlier this week,
someone made the comment that Greeks
wouldn't continue to host philanthropies if
the University didn't make them. Howev-er, the entire Greek community would say
quite the opposite. Seeing as this comment
was made rather ignorantly by an outsider
to the Greek community looking in, allow
us to illuminate the details. Yes, there are
required Greek standards that must be met
yearly, including an initiative to host a chari-
table event. However, nothing in the range
of the magnitude, time, effort, or dedica-
tion is required that each house puts in to
their philanthropies. The Greek system goes
above and beyond its calling to help the
community with each philanthropic event,
collectively raising hundreds of thousands
of dollars a year to go toward charitable
foundations.
Another bit of naivet6 crept amongst the
editorial page of the Alligator on Tuesday,
when the editorial board accused Beta Theta
Pi's philanthropy of being egotistical. Just
because invoking sorority pride in a compet-
itive fashion is an effective means of garner-
ing participation and raising donations does
not mean that an event is egotistical. We at
Delta Upsilon, instead, applaud Beta Theta
Pi for their efforts and fundraising.
For the naysayers, we would ask, what
have you done for your community re-
cently? Sure, the Alligator has given some
elementary students some excellent oral sex
tips. But let's not demean true philanthropic
achievement.
Delta Upsilon will be hosting its annual
philanthropy, DU Got Talent?, March 18 at
Skyy Night Club. The philanthropy is a tal-
ent show for all student groups, and all pro-
ceeds and donations will go to the Boys and
Girls Club of Gainesville. For more informa-
tion, or to enter a contestant group, please

Frat raises $31K for children
By ANDREA RUMBAUGH
Alligator Contributing Writer
Sigma Chi's annual philanthro-
py, Derby Days, raised a record-
breaking $31,000 for the Children's
Miracle Network at Shands at UF on
Friday and Saturday.
"It's probably one of the best
things we do, and it's a great cause,"
said Brett Owens, a Derby Days
chairman. "It's been really fulfill-
ing."
Sororities also competed to earn
points based on how much money
they raised, how many hats they
collected in a campus-wide hat hunt
and how they performed in a line-
dancing competition.
Kappa Delta won the overall
competition, but Alpha Omicron Pi
won the line dancing competition
About 300 people to Norman Field
on Saturday morning. Fifteen sorori-
ties competed, and each one chose a
theme to base its dance around.
Jenna Rush, an advertising se-
nior, danced her fourth and final
year with Delta Gamma.

Sipka wore a blond wig and said
he enjoyed his breezy halter dress.
"It's a lot more open," Sipka said.
"The air just flows better."
Parents of participants also
showed their support.
Rita Goodman, a 56-year-old
psychotherapist from Orlando, was
there to watch her son Seth Good-
man, a member of Sigma Chi.
"So we are supporting this," she
said, pointing and laughing at herson's leopard-print Tarzan costume.
As she poked fun at her son, his
friend Benjamin Powers, a junior fi-
nance major, came and danced with
her while wearing a Johnny Depp
pirate costume.
"These guys are a lot of fun,"
Goodman said. "They are so nice to
the parents when they come."
She said she enjoyed the event
and appreciated the fraternity's phi-
lanthropy.
"It's fabulous," she said. "I think
it's for a great cause. It's well orga-
nized, and the spirit of the boys and
girls is amazing."
In addition to the parents, soror-
ity sisters and friends cheered and
waved signs as they huddled to-
gether on tarps and beach towels to
watch the competition.
Sarah Crawford, a sophomore
psychology major who cheered for
her Chi Omega sisters, thought this
was one of the best Derby Days. She
also said Chi Omega had the best
dance.
"Ours was the best -that's just
how it goes," Crawford said.Show included parodies
STEP SHOW, from page 1
canes while doing acrobatics.
Other performances also featured parodies of movies
and shows.
The Omega Psi Phi fraternity's team opened their per-
formance with a parody of ESPN. They conducted a mock
interview with Tiger Woods and asked him about his in-
fidelities.
The dancers wore gold boots with purple laces while
dancing drills around orange cones.
Curtis Pugh, a member of Omega Psi Phi, said the team
practiced every night of the week before the
On performance.
Campus "They are very dedicated," Pugh said. "It
is going to be precise."
The show, part of Black History Month, was hosted
by Fonzworth Bentley, from the MTV series "From G's
to Gents."
The Atlanta native said he enjoyed being in Gainesville,
and the crowd erupted into the university's signature
Gator chomp.
"I do have a strong affinity for my dirty South brothers
and sisters," Bentley said.

Walk-off single gives Gators opening-weekend sweep

Freshman catcher Mike Zunino opened his UF career I for 9 at the plate before hitting the game-winning
single Sunday.
UF MEN'S BASKETBALL
Macklin leads Florida to road win
By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
aberry@alligator org
OXFORD, Miss. -While Vernon Macklin was al-
most solely responsible for keeping Florida close in
the first half, Erving Walker put the game away in the
final minute.
Macklin scored a career-high 22 points on 8-of-11
shooting, the Gators made 25 of 27 free throws and
Walker hit six straight from the line in the final 42 sec-
onds to push UF (19-8, 8-4 Southeastern Conference)
past Ole Miss (17-9, 5-7 SEC) 64-61 in Tad Smith Coli-
seum.
UF is now 6-3 in games decided by five points or
fewer, and the team finished 6-0 against the SEC West
for the first time since 2003.
Macklin had 16 of his 22 points in the first half Sat-
urday, taking advantage of the Rebels' man-to-man
defense to score 11 of the Gators' first 15 points.
He also hit all six of his free throws and grabbed
seven rebounds.
After struggling to find his rhythm at the begin-
ning of the season, Macklin is finally getting more
comfortable in the post. The junior center topped his
previous career high of 20 points, which he set earlierthis month against Mississippi State.
"I'm very confident right now," Macklin said, add-
ing that he has put in time with assistant coach Rob
Lanier to improve his post game. "Working on my
post moves is making me more confident and relaxed
when I get the ball."
The challenge for Macklin now, UF coach Billy
Donovan said, is staying consistent. After his 20-point
performance against Mississippi State, Macklin scored
just five at South Carolina four days
later.
"He played great, and he carried
us in a lot of ways, but he needs to
take that next step where he be-
comes a consistent player night after
night," Donovan said. "It may not be
scoring, but just being a consistent
presence out there all the time."
Macklin was even good enough from the free-
throw line -usually a weakness for the 6-foot-10
center -for Donovan to leave him in for most of the
crunch-time minutes.
But when the Gators needed someone to close out
the game from the line, Walker stepped up.
SEE HOOPS, PAGE 15* FRESHMAN MIKE ZUNINO
HIT THE GAME-WINNER.
By TYLER JETT
Alligator Writer
tjett@alligator org
Mike Zunino couldn't have
asked for a better conclusion to his
first weekend with the Gators.
After starting the series 1 for 9,
the freshman catcher stepped to the
plate in the 10th inning with two
outs, the score tied at six and the po-
tential winning run on second base.
Coach Kevin O'Sullivan told him
to expect a fastball from USF closer
Kevin Quackenbush. Down 0-1
in the count, Zunino saw one and
swung, although he said he was too
excited and hit the pitch off the end
of his bat.
The result was a bloop single
down the right-field line that fell just
out of the reach of USF outfielder
Stephen Hunt. Sophomore Tyler
Thompson scored on the walk-off
single, giving the No. 7 Gators a 7-6
win in an opening-weekend sweep
of the Bulls (0-3).
One of Zunino's ugliest swings
produced one of the most clutch hit
of the series.
"You hit some of those in battingpractice and the coaches say, 'Oh,
that's a game-winner,"' he said of
the soft knock. "And then it comes
down and actually happens like
that. It's pretty ironic."
UF (3-0) won the first two games
of the weekend with lights-out
pitching and power hitting, but the
Gators needed to play small ball to
steal the final game of the series.
After surrendering a total of two
runs in nine innings on Friday and
Saturday, UF's bullpen imploded in
the eighth when sophomores Nick
Maronde and Greg Larson allowed
five runs.
But, down 6-3, the Gators rallied
in the ninth inning against Quack-
enbush. With the bases loaded, two
outs and a full count, senior Matt den
Dekker hit a two-run single through
the right side of the infield.
The Gators' comeback appeared
to end prematurely, though, when
UF first baseman Preston Tucker hit
a grounder to Bulls shortstop Sam
Mende. But Mende couldn't handle
it, and freshman Nolan Fontana
scored the tying run.
Zunino's single the next inning
gave the Gators their first come-
from-behind victory of the season,

he first official goal scored in Florida lacrosse history

It will go down in the record books with Sam Far-
rell's name at 28:10. The freshman was actually trying to pass
to Brittany Dashiell, but an errant toss landed in the back of
the net.
"Right when I passed it, I was like, 'Uh-oh,' because it was
not a very good pass," Farrell said. "But
it went in."

and the standing-room-only crowd of

good thing.
"They'll know really when we do play bad or
when we play well," UF coach Amanda O'Leary
said with a laugh. "When you're playing in front
of a crowd like we did tonight, I don't think it
mattered whether we played well or we didn't
play well. All that mattered was they got behind
us."
Saturday marked the culmination of a multi-
year process. O'Leary took the Florida job in June
2007, long before there was a lacrosse facility to
see. I wanted to see what this new sport was all
about. I learned watching a new sport is similar to
traveling someplace you've never been before.
Everything is unfamiliar.
The sometimes slow-to-develop attacks re-
minded me of soccer. The attacker behind the net
(Florida freshman Ashley Bruns for most of the
night) has the responsibility of deciding to pass or
shoot, much like a point guard.
But lacrosse is also unlike any other sport.
Fouls earn the offensive player a small head start
when the match resumes. The continuation of
play never requires a pass. Shots usually end up
in the back of the net or miss entirely -seven
saves on 48 shots Saturday.
The game can bog down at times. There were
two scoring droughts of almost seven minutes,
which wouldn't be so bad except attacking turned
into holding the ball and unproductive running.
I'm told the men's version allows more con-
tact, and while the fouls didn't annoy me most
of the night (43 in the game), there was one Jack-
sonville possession where the same player was
fouled three times, each coming a few yards (and
seconds) after the other. That will wear on you.
The best reason to check out lacrosse is the
talent on the field. Florida plays in the top con-
ference, including five-time defending champ
Northwestern, and while the Gators may struggle
initially due to youth, I believe they will be com-
petitive soon. (Heck, they received votes in the In-
side Lacrosse preseason poll, and they had never
played a match.)
U has the talent, the facility and the commu-
nity support. Do yourself a favor, and make it out
to one of the eight remaining home matches.
It won't be a mistake.against the Bulls in limited action.
O'Sullivan restricted each starter to
about 70 pitches, saying he didn't want
to jeopardize their health early in the 56-
game season.
Five of UF's six runs
were scored on singles,
and the other cameBaseball when Tucker reached
first on Mende's ninth-
inning error. That of-
fensive effort was dramatically different
from the first two games, when UF hit
five home runs.After being called one of the most
important pieces to the Gators' offense
in the preseason, freshman cleanup hit-
ter Austin Maddox met expectations
this weekend.
Maddox hit two home runs and
would have had two more if not for USF
center fielder Ryan Lockwood, who
robbed Maddox of homers on Saturday
and Sunday.
"That's unbelievable," O'Sullivan
said of Lockwood's catches. "It's unbe-
lievable to see one play like that, but it
almost looked like identical plays."
Walker hits six free
throws in final minute
HOOPS, from page 14
With 42 seconds left and UF up 58-57, Walker
subbed in for Macklin and drained six-straight
free throws to hold off the Rebels.
"He's got ice in his veins," junior forward
Chandler Parsons said. "When the game's on the
line, give him the ball."
Walker thrived at the line despite a poor
shooting performance for the second-straight
game. The sophomore point guard made no field
goals against Auburn on Thursday and wasn't
much better Saturday, hitting just two of his 10
attempts.
Walker and freshman guard Kenny Boynton
combined to shoot just 4 of 22 from the field, and
UF's only three-pointer came when the ball was
blocked into the hands of a wide-open Dan Wer-
ner on a bizarre play with 6:06 remaining.
Still, the Gators found a way to win -some-
thing they will have to do to keep their NCAA
Tournament dreams alive.
"We don't want to live or die by the three-
point line," Parsons said. "We know where we
want to get to, and this was a huge win on the
road. We've just got to keep taking it one game
at a time, keep rebounding, keep doing all the
physical things and not worry about our offense,
because we've got a lot of guys that can score."

Florida tops Jacksonville in first-ever lacrosse match
By TONI-ANN MILLER
Alligator Writer
Less than five minutes after the
start of Florida's inaugural game
against Jacksonville, spectators were
turned away at the gate of Donald R.
Dizney Stadium.
At 6:20 p.m., university officials
closed the gates. The 1,500-seat sta-
dium couldn't take any more fans.
The 2,114 onhandwere rewarded
with a 16-6 victory for the Gators.
"That type of crowd and the
enthusiasm they showed was just
second to none," UT coach Amanda
O'Leary said. "For our players to be
able to play in front of that kind of
home crowd was just an amazing
experience for all of them."
Attacker Ashley Bruns led the
Gators with four goals and four as-
sists, and attacker Julie Schindel and
midfielder Colby Rhea added three
goals each.
Midfielder Rachael Zimmerman
scooped up 10 ground balls, while
JT collected 15 total.
The crowd stood by as the Gators
introduced UF's newest sport, but
the team showed signs of its youth.
UT's first game had all the fixings
of a new program.
The team had spurts where itflourished, runs of sloppy play and
perhaps first-game nerves.
The Gators scored three goals in
the first six minutes of the match
and limited Jacksonville to only two
goals in the second half.
The team had 10 turnovers to
Jacksonville's 18. However, UF had
a barrage of dropped passes in the
first 10 minutes of the game.
"For our players to be able
to play in front of that kind
of home crowd was just an
amazing experience for all
of them."
Amanda O'Leary
UF lacrosse coach
During a timeout with 20:55 left
in the first half, O'Leary said she
told the team it needed to clean up
its play.
"We needed to take a deep
breath," she said. "There was some
nervousness amongst the group,
but once they took that deep breath
and realized that they were OK, that
this is going to be something they're
going to have to play in each and
every game, it came together at that'I,A 4

Men, women take second place at SEC Championship
* THE GATORS WON 14 CONFER-
ENCE TITLES.
By MATT RUBIN
Alligator Writer
The men's and women's swimming and
diving teams finished second at the 2010 South-
eastern Conference Championship Meet.
The men's team finished with 765 points
while Auburn took first with 784. The women
finished with 698 points as Georgia pulled
away with 824.5."I am really, really proud of the way both
of our teams came out and raced tough this
whole week," said UF coach Gregg Troy, who
won SEC Men's Swimming Coach of the Year.
"We had a couple opportunities that we didn't
take advantage of, but we qualified most of the
people we needed for NCAAs and had some
outstanding swims.
"Overall, our entire coaching staff is very
proud of our team and their effort this week."
In the four days of competition, the Gators
had a total of 14 SEC titles, eight for the women
and six for the men. As expected, SEC Wom-
en's Swimmer of the Year Gemma Spofforthstood out. Spofforth won or helped win the
200-yard individual medley, 200-yard free-
style relay, 100-yard backstroke and 200-yard
backstroke.
SEC Women's Diver of
the Year Kara Salamone
started the meet with a win
Swimming in the one-meter divingcompetition and ended it
with a win in the platform
competition.
"Coming into this week, I felt like we could
do really good on the diving boards and win
some events," said UF diving coach DonnieCraine, who earned SEC Diving Coach of the
Year. "This has been an outstanding week, not
only for Kara, but for all of our divers. Now
we hope to carry this momentum to NCAA
Zone Diving."
On the men's side, senior Shaune Fraser
was responsible for three of the titles, placing
first as a member of the 800-yard freestyle re-
lay team, first in the 200-yard individual med-
ley and first in the 100-yard butterfly.
Junior Conor Dwyer, who was the anchor
