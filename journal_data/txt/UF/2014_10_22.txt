The District E senator seat is 
still vacant, despite Tuesday’s 
UF Student Senate meeting agenda. 
Members did not vote in 
District E senator candidate Amanda Meyers, who was taken off the agenda for not submitting additional proof of residency before the meeting.
District E represents stu-
dents living outside of Alachua County. 
No candidate qualiﬁ  ed for 
the seat during the Fall 2014 Student Government elections.
Additional proof of resi-dency for eligibility is required for the seat, according to Senate President Joseph Michaels. 
Senate President Pro Tem-
pore Davis Bean said Meyers’ position is pending until her 
documentation is in. 
Bean said Meyers will be 
present at the next Senate meet-
ing once her paperwork is sub-mitted.
Later in the meeting, the 
Senate voted in favor of $632 in funding for the Academic and Career Excellence Student Mentoring Society. The orga-nization is a mentoring service for UF students, as well as other schools in the community. The 
Senate will vote to ﬁ  nally ap-
prove the funds next week.
Before the meeting began, 
ice cream was served to sena-tors during an orientation on bills, resolutions and parlia-mentary procedures. Michaels ended the meeting with inspi-ration for the new senators. 
“You are orientated,” Mi-
chaels said. “You made it through orientation. The term has begun, and it’s time to start working for your constitu-ents.” District E still lacks senatorSTUDENT GOVERNMENT

The Association for Women in Science’s 
North Central Florida Afﬁ  liate Group is 
hoping to form a partnership with Santa 
Fe College.
The organization is already afﬁ  liated 
with UF and will host a meeting at Santa Fe today at 1:15 p.m. in Room W-206 to 
gauge student interest, said the group’s 
spokeswoman Kim Van Vliet.
“There is a lot of talent at UF and Santa 
Fe,” Van Vliet said. “Our organization is 
sort of a way to connect all these groups.”
The regional group was established in 
January as an offshoot of the national as-sociation, which is the largest multi-disci-plinary organization for women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.
“We hope to increase the number of 
women participating in these ﬁ  elds,” Van 
Vliet said. “UF is just one area of focus.”
The afﬁ  liate group consists of about 40 members and is open to both men and 
women, she said. It aims to provide equal 
networking, mentoring and career devel-
opment opportunities for women in STEM ﬁ  elds.
UF bioengineering senior Matias Ka-
plan said discrimination against women is 
one of the biggest challenges STEM ﬁ  elds 
currently face.
“Unfortunately, with many engineering 
classes, there’s a much larger proportion 
of men to women,” the 22-year-old said.Women in Science to reach out to Santa Fe STEM students ◗ SHE SPOKE ABOUT BULLYING.

In anticipation for Saturday’s Pride Pa-
rade, a group of about 20 people gathered 
at Cymplify Central’s small coffee shop and 
listened to leading LGBT researcher Eliza-
bethe Payne speak.
Payne traveled from her post as founder 
and director of the Queering Education Re-search Institute at New York City’s Hunter College on Tuesday night to discuss the im-portance of restructuring school culture to better address LGBT bullying.Local LGBT activist groups chipped in 
to pay Payne about $800 for her discussion, which took place at 5402 NW Eighth Ave. Six organizations were involved in co-spon-soring the event, including UF LGBT Affairs and the Pride Community Center of North Central Florida.
According to Payne’s studies, the No. 1 
cause for bullying is appearance, followed by an individual’s perceived sexual orienta-tion or gender identity.

The dean of the College of Phar-
macy is the first woman at UF to be 
elected into the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies.
Julie Johnson was one of 70 peo-
ple elected into the honorary and advisory organization during its 44th annual meeting in Washington, 
D.C. on Monday.
“It’s really a huge honor,” she 
said.
Only eight other faculty at UF 
have been elected to the institute, 
including the university’s seventh 
president, Dr. Robert Marston. Mar-
ston was elected in 1973. 
All of those elected were men. 
Members are elected based on their professional achievements, research and skills that would contribute to the institute’s goals, Jennifer Walsh, senior media officer for the institute, wrote in an email. 
Johnson was also the first female 
to be appointed dean of the College of Pharmacy.
Paul Doering, emeritus distin-guished service professor of phar-macotherapy and translational re-search, served under four different 
deans and said Johnson fully de-
serves the recognition.
“When I look 
at Julie Johnson, 
I don’t see male-ness or female-ness,” he said. “I just see an exem-plary researcher 
who has earned 
every bit of re-spect she’s got.”
Johnson first joined the college 
in 1998 and was named dean in Au-gust 2013. 
Her research focuses on how 
patients vary in their response to drugs, particularly in the cardiovas-
cular realm.
“She’s absolutely riding a crest 
right now when it comes to the 
hottest areas of pharmaceutical re-search,” Doering said. 
Reginald Frye collaborated with 
Johnson on her research.
“She’s made major contributions 
in the field of cardiovascular phar-macogenomics and in particular re-ally, implementation of personalized medicine,” said Frye,  UF professor 
and chair of Pharmacotherapy and 
Translational Research.
About 2,000 members partici-
pate and contribute to the institute’s research and policy evaluations, Walsh said.
Last year, the institute com-
pleted a study meant to determine what was known on how to reduce 
sports-related concussions in young 
athletes.
Another study focused on ana-
lyzing the treatment of post-trau-matic stress disorder in military and veteran populations.
Johnson said there aren’t many 
other pharmaceutical professionals in the institute. 
Her time with the institute will 
not interfere with her position as dean, she said. 
“It’s something that, within the 
health sciences and health profes-sions, is really just this major recog-nition of scientific and leadership accomplishments,” she said.Pharmacy dean elected to institute

� THE LAW REQUIRES 
PHOTO ID.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
WASHINGTON — The Su-
preme Court has allowed Texas 
to use its strict voter ID law in the November election even after a federal judge said the 
law was the equivalent of a poll 
tax and threatened to deprive many blacks and Latinos of the right to vote this year.
Like earlier orders in North 
Carolina, Ohio and Wisconsin, the justices’ action before dawn on Saturday, two days before the start of early voting in Tex-
as, appears to be based on their 
view that changing the rules so close to an election would be confusing.
The Supreme Court’s brief 
unsigned order, like those in 
the other three states, offers no 
explanation for its action. In this case, the Justice Department and civil rights groups were asking that Texas be prevented from requiring the photo ID in the Nov. 4 election, where roughly 600,000 voters, dispro-portionately black and Latino, 
lack acceptable forms of ID.
Republican lawmakers in 
Texas and elsewhere say voter 
ID laws are needed to reduce voter fraud. Democrats contend that such cases are extremely rare and that voter ID measures are attempts to keep eligible voters, many of them minori-
ties who support Democrats, 
away from the polls.US Supreme Court  
allows voter ID laws“In my high school, one lesbian in my grade had 
to drop out for mental health issues,” Arthur, 20,  said. 
“LGBT students are more susceptible to emotional toll from harsh words because usually, there’s internalized shame about being LGBT.”
LB Hannahs, director of LGBT Affairs, had Payne as 
a professor while attending Syracuse University and is involved with Payne’s institute. 
“When we talk about LGBT bullying, we tend to 
think of it in the context of K-12, (and) we tend to stop talking about bullying on college campuses, but it still 
happens, and we don’t think about it in the same way,” 
Hannahs said.
Forming Gay-Straight Alliance groups and creating 
safe spaces and character education are some forms of fostering cultural changes in school environments, but Payne said she worries school curriculums rely too heavily on students to create change.
“Days chosen to celebrate LGBT people are often as-
sociated with days marking victimizations, disease and 
murder,” Payne said. “We need to give LGBT youth the 
idea that they have the ability to grow up with happy, healthy and whole lives.”4, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 22, 2014

◗ IT’S CIRCULATING ON SO -
CIAL MEDIA.
PATRICK PINAK
Alligator Staff Writer ppinak@alligator.org
As the Ebola epidemic unfolds, 
Internet users should be aware of 
scams, fake articles and links con-taining viruses circulating social media channels. 
One link floating around Face-
book is an article citing an Ebola case confirmed in Ocala, which is not true. Once users click on the link from Feednewz, a create-your-own-prank website, it alerts people they’ve been pranked.
But not everyone clicks the link 
before sharing, thus the frenzy.
“There’s a lot of stuff on the Inter-
net that’s not true, and it’s up to the individual to verify it themselves,” said Andrew Selepak, director of UF’s Masters of Arts in Mass Com-munication in social media. “Other-
wise, you kind of embarrass yourself 
by sharing something or spreading something that isn’t true.”
Selepak said this phenomenon 
happens often during times of di-sasters. He said he commonly sees people sharing links to fake news stories on Facebook.
“Sadly enough, there’s always 
going to be people that like to stir 
the pot or like to take advantage of 
the ignorance and goodwill of oth-ers,” he said, “and social media is simply allowing people to do it on a grander scale to a wider audience.”
One thing Internet users can do is 
research information for themselves, using websites like Snopes, Selepak said. Snopes currently has a list of the top 25 hottest urban legends, which currently includes a handful of Ebola-related articles.
“That website is really good for 
helping people kind of get through 
these rumors that are getting thrown 
around the Internet that aren’t true,” Selepak said.
UF biology sophomore Pam In-
glett said she would have clicked on the link, just in case it were true. She said she doesn’t think these practices are ethical.
“People shouldn’t be tricked,” 
the 19-year-old said. “(They) are scared right now.” Hoax claims Ebola case in OcalacAmpuS

With the Ebola epidemic, UF is preparing 
for potential virus outbreaks on campus.
“Certainly, Ebola is on everyone’s mind,” 
said UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes.
Sikes said students need to remember the 
flu and other viruses are more likely to spread 
during this time of year, which is why every-one should be mindful of face-touching hab-
its.“We are working on general communica-
tions that will go out campuswide about vi-
ruses in general,” she said.
If there were an Ebola case in the UF com-
munity, UF would work with the Florida De-partment of Health to identify people who had contact with that individual.  Then the de-partment would determine if anyone needed to be monitored, isolated or potentially quar-antined, and UF would assist in that process, Sikes said.“The recent meningitis 
case is a good example of how UF and the health de-partment worked together to conduct contact tracing,” Sikes wrote in an email.
Fedro Zazueta, associ-
ate corporate information officer in UF’s Office of 
Academic Technology and a professor in the Agricultural and Biological Engineering De-partment, said this is not the first time UF has developed ways to deal with virus outbreaks. He said during the H1N1 virus (swine flu) scare back in 2009, the university had a general strategy to reduce contact among people.
UF has now developed a system for stu-
dents to continue their classes if the campus must be quarantined, Zazueta said.  Faculty members have created their in-class courses to 
be readily available online in a course manage-
ment system if campus were to shut down.

Prominent FSU fraternity 
suspended 
TALLAHASSEE, Fla.  — 
One of Florida State Univer-
sity’s more prominent fraterni-ties is being suspended amid an ongoing rape investigation.
Campus police say they are 
investigating an alleged sexual battery that occurred at the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity house. Authorities were called about 
the incident early in the morn-
ing on Oct. 11.
FSU officials have sent let-
ters to the fraternity telling 
them because of the serious-
ness of the allegations, they cannot hold normal activities or participate in intramurals. All contact with pledges must 
also be placed on hold.
The Tallahassee Democrat 
reports that Pi Kappa Alpha, 
or the “Pikes,” as they are 
known, were at the center of 
an investigation into a brutal rape in the late ‘80s. The frater-nity was kicked out of FSU and did not return for more than a 
decade.
Police: Jacksonville man

JACKSONVILLE, Fla.  — A 
62-year-old man is dead after 
he was apparently robbed and shot while on his way to work.
Police say the shooting oc-
curred shortly after 4 a.m. in 
Jacksonville as Gary Leon Bell 
neared a bus stop in an area of the city where extra patrols were ordered earlier this year 
because of a high crime rate.
The Florida Times-Union 
reports police believe Bell was 
robbed before he was fatally shot.
Roads in the area were 
closed early Tuesday as police investigated.
No further details were im-
mediately available.Cyclist dies after being hit

DANIA BEACH, Fla.  — 
Authorities say a commuter train fatally struck a 53-year-old cyclist near Fort Lauder-dale.
The crash happened Mon-
day as Jerry Smith failed to yield at an intersection in Da-nia Beach. The Broward Sher-iff’s Office said Monday that 
all safety equipment including 
lights, bells and gates were working properly as the train neared the intersection.
Deputies say Smith navigat-
ed around the safety gates and tried to cross the tracks ahead of the train. He was struck and thrown off the bicycle.
Broward Fire Rescue offi-

Teen, 13, pulled over in

OCALA, Fla.  — Police say 
a 13-year-old runaway in north 
Florida stole a front-end loader 
and began driving down the interstate with the idea of go-ing to Fort Lauderdale.
The Marion County Sher-
iff’s Office said the boy ran away Sunday morning and went looking for a vehicle to steal at a nearby construction 
company.
The Ocala Star-Banner re-
ported that the boy couldn’t 
find the keys to a Mack truck, 
so he grabbed a front-end load-
er parked in the company’s lot and drove it through a locked gate.
He made it about 3 miles 
down the busy Interstate 75 before a Florida Highway Pa-trol trooper stopped him.
Fort Lauderdale is about 
280 miles south of Ocala.

For a price that usually gets them one-third 
of an order of chili cheese fries, Krystal custom-
ers were able to purchase the classic Krystal hamburger and a small drink for 82 cents Tues-day in celebration of the oldest burger chain in 
the Southeast’s 82nd anniversary.
Employees placed trays of steaming burg-
ers and fries in front of customers ranging from 
a tiny, blond toddler to a group of rowdy con-struction workers. 
The red, white and blue building at 7700 W. 
Newberry Road is speckled with six black-and-white photos on one of its walls, each showcas-ing past Krystal locations.
Gainesville native Terrald Bryant, 43, has 
been enjoying the mini square-shaped burg-ers since 1987, when the chain was exclusively known for its small sliders. 
At the time, there was a location that was 
walking distance from UF’s campus, Bryant, a lawn technician, said.
“After the clubs and football games, every-
one would go to Krystal’s,” Bryant said.  
When Bryant was in high school, his foot-
ball games were held in Ben Hill Griffin Stadi-um. After, he and his friends would trek across 
the street to feast on the most popular item on 
the menu — the Krystal.  
Bryant can still remember watching the em-
ployees place the square meat patties side by side on the large grill. He would order about 20 burgers at 25 cents each.
Nowadays, Bryant does not frequent the 
burger joint as much because he lives across town. When he does get a chance to stop by, 
he gets the breakfast bowl, which has become 
his favorite. 
“I get grits, cheese, eggs and a choice of 
meat,” he said. 
Krystal first emerged in 1932 in a free-stand-
ing building in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Part-ners Rody Davenport Jr. and J. Glenn Sherrill wanted to provide quality food and low prices to people during the Great Depression.  
Thirty-five cents would provide six Krys-
tals and a cup of coffee, said Renee Beckham, Krystal district supervisor for Gainesville and Jacksonville.  
The first Krystal in the state of Florida was 
opened in the Roosevelt Hotel in downtown Jacksonville, Beckham said. 
Back then, one Krystal cost one nickel, Beck-
ham said. Now, it’s 79 cents. WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 22, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 5

A few years ago, Fiki Owhoso 
didn’t care about sustainability.
After participating in environ-
mental education programs, the 
19-year-old Santa Fe College en-gineering sophomore started get-ting more involved.
And today, she is helping to 
host Santa Fe’s Campus Sustain-ability Day from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. 
at the Oak Grove.
“No matter how much we try 
to stay far away from sustain-
ability, it’s always right down the corner,” Owhoso said.Students can learn about the 
environment and ways to raise awareness at the event, which will include guest speakers, such 
as Steve Robitaille, the board 
president of Florida Defenders of the Environment. 
There will also be a public 
screening of “Gimme Green,” a documentary about the effects of human waste in the environment. The film’s director and Santa Fe’s Digital Media Technology pro-
gram coordinator, Eric Flagg, will 
host a discussion with attendees afterward.
Taking care of the environ-
ment doesn’t require completely changing your lifestyle, said Vil-ma Fuentes, Santa Fe’s academic 
affairs assistant vice president.
“You can begin by taking 
small incremental steps, wheth-
er it’s recycling, or composting, or riding your bike to school or 
work… thinking more in terms 
of economic viability,” she said. “You can take lots of small steps that can really make a big differ-
ence to the broader picture.” Sante Fe to celebrate Sustainability Day with guest speakers

WASHINGTON — North Korea’s 
reclusive government abruptly freed 
an American man Tuesday, nearly six months after he was arrested on 
charges of leaving a Bible in a night-
club, but Pyongyang refused to hand over two other U.S. citizens who are 
still being held.
There was no immediate explana-
tion for the release of Jeffrey Fowle, who was quickly whisked to the U.S. 
territory of Guam before heading back to his wife and three children 
in Miamisburg, Ohio. Relations be-
tween Washington and Pyongyang, never warm, are at a particularly low 
point, and the U.S. has sought unsuc-
cessfully for months to send a high-level representative to North Korea 
to negotiate acquittals for all three 
men.
State Department deputy spokes-
woman Marie Harf said Fowle was seen by doctors and appeared to be in good medical health. She declined 
to give more details about his release 
except to thank the government of Sweden, which has an embassy in Pyongyang, for its “tireless efforts.”
Harf would not say whether any 
American officials had intervened di-rectly with the North Koreans.
Fowle, 56, arrived there on April 
29 and was arrested in May for leav-ing a Bible at the nightclub. Christian evangelism is considered a crime in 
North Korea.
He was awaiting trial — the only 
one of the three Americans held by Pyongyang who had not been con-
victed of charges.
The two others — Kenneth Bae 
and Matthew Miller — were each sentenced to years in North Korean prisons after court trials that lasted 
no more than 90 minutes. The three 
Americans entered North Korea sep-arately.
Analysts say North Korea has pre-
viously used detained Americans as leverage in its standoff with the U.S., 
a contention that Pyongyang denies. 
Washington, too, has floated the pos-sibility of a diplomatic opening in ties 
between the two countries should

JACKSONVILLE — Florida’s leading 
candidates for governor clashed fiercely 
during their final debate on Tuesday night, 
sniping at each other over everything, from 
the economy and the minimum wage to the death penalty.
Republican-turned-
Democrat Charlie Crist and Republican Gov. Rick Scott, essentially tied in the polls, used their final moments before the tele-
vision cameras to come 
up with some of the most personal attacks leveled so far in what has already been an extremely negative cam-
paign.
Crist called Scott “out of touch” with 
regular Floridians, while Scott called Crist 
a “divider” who switched parties and poli-cies to further his political career.
“What is he saying this year that he actu-
ally believes, whether it’s on taxes, educa-tion or abortion?” Scott asked.
As they debated the economy and who 
was responsible for the recovery, Scott con-tended that Crist, the son of a doctor, grew up rich and didn’t know the struggles of poor people like he did. Crist fired back by saying Scott, who is now a multimillionaire 
after growing up poor, didn’t care about 
the middle class and spent all his time in a private jet and seaside mansion.
Crist used that line to stress the need to 
raise the minimum wage 
to $10.10 an hour, which 
Scott opposes because he argued it could prompt some businesses to pare 
back the number of jobs 
they offer.
Scott said he did be-
lieve there should be 
some sort of minimum wage in place, but when asked how much it should be, he re-
sponded: “How would I know? I mean, the private sector decides wages.”
They each took digs at the other’s past, 
with Crist attacking Scott over his time as the head of the hospital chain HCA/Co-lumbia, which was fined $1.7 billion for Medicare fraud. Crist repeated a line from one of his ads, saying Scott once invoked 
his Fifth Amendment right against self-
incrimination while questioned about an unrelated civil lawsuit.Final Florida gubernatorial

There comes a time in every college student’s life 
when a strange, unwelcome thought suddenly ﬂ  ashes through their mind: I am growing up. 
It sneaks up on you when you least expect it. Some-
where in the middle of a coffee break, a late-night study session, a party or a gameday tailgate, this thought will hit you hard and fast. You will eventually graduate col-
lege and have to ﬁ  gure out your life. In other words, 
adulthood is just around the corner, and it’s calling your name. 
To many college students, this is an uncomfortable 
reality. When birthdays roll around, it becomes difﬁ  cult 
to ignore the tiny voice inside your head reminding you 
that you’re getting older and closer to becoming a real adult. Last week, my friend admitted that she is so wor-ried about having to graduate, she is seriously consider-
ing adding another major to stay in school. 
It isn’t difﬁ  cult to understand her concern, especially 
because we are constantly told that college will be the 
best four years of our lives. Listening to our parents and teachers longingly reminisce about their own college 
days does not exactly inspire excitement upon entering 
adulthood.
After all, none of us really know how our lives will 
turn out once we complete college or ﬁ  nish graduate 
school. We pour our hearts into our degrees, hoping we 
have chosen the right ﬁ  eld and wondering if the hard work will pay off.  But the questions still linger: Will I ﬁ  nd happiness? How long will it take to get a job? What if I fail? 
As I write this column, it is my 22nd birthday. Ever 
since I was a freshman at UF, I felt wary of this age and what it represents. This is the year I will graduate college. This is the year I will painstakingly send out cover letter 
after cover letter, nervously searching for an entry-level 
job. This is the year I will try to make a home in a new city and say goodbye to cherished friends and family. To me, this year used to be a 
symbol of uncertainty and fear. For many of you, the last year 
in college probably evokes the 
same uneasy emotions. 
Thinking about the future 
can be frightening, but I have 
learned that becoming an adult 
is not something to be afraid of. I realized that these past three years in college have given me 
the strength, wisdom and conﬁ  dence to face any chal-
lenge that comes my way. Over the course of our college 
experience, we change and grow in signiﬁ  cant ways that prepare us for the next stages in our lives.
When you overcame an internship or project that was 
more challenging than you expected, you learned that you are more capable than you thought. When you de-veloped friendships with people you never thought you would, you learned to appreciate other people’s differ-ences. When you overcame a painful experience, you 
learned that you are strong. These are meaningful les-
sons that will be valuable not only in the months after college, but also throughout our entire lives.
I’m not saying I don’t worry about ﬁ  nding a job — or 
that the road to adulthood won’t be ﬁ  lled with obstacles. I still obsess over my resume, worry about becoming ﬁ  -nancially independent and think about what I want my future to look like. Growing up shouldn’t be associated with fear, goodbyes and uncertainty. Rather, it should 
be about self-discovery, adventures and welcoming new 
opportunities. 
If you face adulthood with optimism and passion, you 
might just ﬁ  nd that the best years of your life aren’t in the 
past. They’re in the future, waiting for you.

restrictions fuel 
baseless Ebola fear 
Americans are in a panic about the recent Ebola cases in 
Texas. On Sept. 30, Thomas Eric Duncan, a Liberian who was visiting family in Dallas, was diagnosed with Ebola. 
On Oct. 8, Duncan died of the virus. Two health care workers who treated Duncan, Amber Vinson and Nina Pham, were also 
diagnosed with Ebola and are currently being treated. 
The most common response to the Ebola crisis from politi-
cians and media pundits has been to call for some kind of travel 
ban between the U.S. and West African countries, where the vi-rus has spread widely. 
However, numerous public health experts, including Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Prevention Director Thomas Frie-den, have argued that a travel ban could actually worsen the situation by making travel from West Africa more difﬁ  cult to 
monitor. Frieden has also said travel restrictions could make it 
harder to provide humanitarian aid and medical treatment to areas affected by Ebola. 
U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., added to the hysteria this week 
when he announced his plan to propose a temporary ban on is-suing visas to travelers from countries where Ebola has spread. 
“Our biggest priority is ensuring that sufﬁ  cient safeguards 
are in place to limit the spread of Ebola, contain it at the source, and protect Americans,” Rubio said in a statement.  He also said 
the complex issues surrounding the Ebola situation “continue to 
threaten US national security.” 
Despite Rubio’s insistence that Ebola is an urgent public 
health and national security issue, his proposed bill won’t even be introduced to Senate until mid-November, when Congress reconvenes following the midterm elections. In the meantime, Rubio apparently has more important things to do, like cam-paigning for Gov. Rick Scott’s re-election on Monday. 
To be fair, Rubio isn’t the only Florida politician to make ig-
norant proposals about containing Ebola. U.S. Rep. Dennis Ross, R-Fla., previously suggested that the U.S. ban all direct ﬂ  ights ar-riving stateside from Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone. There’s only one problem: There are no direct ﬂ  ights to the U.S. from any of those countries. 
In reality, Americans have no reason to fear an Ebola out-
break. Despite budget cuts to the CDC and other public health agencies, the U.S. has one of the most advanced health care sys-tems in the world. Because Ebola requires direct contact with 
bodily ﬂ  uids, the disease is exceptionally difﬁ  cult to contract.
In 2012, more than 33,500 Americans were killed in motor ve-
hicle accidents. About 1 million Americans every year die from 
heart disease. However, neither of these causes of death receives a fraction of the media coverage or political attention afforded to Ebola, which has yet to kill a single American citizen. 
Rubio, Ross and other politicians should stop using Ebola as 
a scare tactic to needlessly confuse and alarm voters ahead of the November election. Such fearmongering distracts from real issues affecting Floridians, such as the economy, education and climate change.

College football is a murky busi-
ness. Any organizations that pull in so much tax-free revenue, have 
so much say in the ﬁ  nancial stakes of both the universities and the communities that 
house them and have such ubiquitous control over its 
unpaid employees are bound to be caught up in some shady stuff.
Florida State University is the most recent school 
with its hand caught in the cookie jar of college foot-ball’s corrupt politics. With legitimate, national news organizations like ESPN and The New York Times turning their gaze onto the university, many unwel-comed blemishes seem to be making their way into the 
national spotlight.
FSU is being portrayed as a university with, at best, 
a football program whose ensured success takes prece-
dence over everything else. In the most recent report from The New York Times, both the Tallahassee Police Department and FSU have come under ﬁ  re for their less-than-proactive approach to punishing football players for criminal activity.
However, there seems to be one constant behind 
this, a singular source that appears to be attracting the full brunt of the national shame straight toward the university: The looming, ominous ﬁ  gure of … a 20-year-old kid.
Jameis Winston’s story has evolved from portray-
ing him as a prodigal savior, to a pariah, to a vindi-cated champion, to a bumbling fool and to a pariah once more. He’s been lambasted on TV, revered all the more locally as he continues to win and is turned into 
a meme on Twitter. 
#BlameJameis has emerged as a sort of mocking 
rallying cry — one that FSU students have taken up 
to defend what, to them, seems like a ﬂ  ood of unwar-ranted hate that has now broadened to the university as a whole.
In some sense, this is a fair criticism. It’s easy to 
squint your eyes at autographs, screamed obscenities; BB guns and water cups ﬁ  lled with soda and see all the 
tools one would need to cast angry judgment on some-
one else’s character — it ﬁ  ts the narrative. But taken individually? Without the hysteria-ridden, hyperbolic 24-hour news cycle compounding stories of univer-sity-wide cover-ups  of 19- and 20-year-olds running around with BB guns, the moral outrage falls apart.
What this really all comes down to is the most criti-
cal issue of the matter: the sexual assault charge against Winston. That was the genesis of everything that came 
after, the reason we scowl and not laugh when Winston 
stands on a table in the union and screams obscenities against women.
This is not to say that the still ongoing investigation 
does not deserve attention — quite the opposite, in fact. By comparing the sexual assault allega-tions with every other petty deviance that has gone on this year with Jameis Winston, it diminishes the weight of a sexual assault allegation.
Discussing things like “illegally” signing his name 
on too many pieces of paper not only draws attention away from the assault charge, but also inevitably ends up trivializing it. 
In people’s haste to compound the evidence against 
Winston, and by extension the university, they’re bury-ing the lede — the endemic culture of rape and the way in which sexual assault cases have been so mishandled at FSU.
And that is what gets to the core of the problem be-
hind FSU’s growing notoriety in the eyes of the nation. We’ve reached a point where the football program, namely its star quarterback, is now charged with main-taining the university’s good name. His every action and subsequent reaction from both the local police force and the university is examined under the most scorching of microscopes — and our need to join in on the damnation of an unpopular player and a now 
unpopular program lets incidents with BB guns get 
treated with the same kind of severity if they had been touting pistols on the quad.
Corruption within big-time college athletics has 
happened before, and it is bound to happen again. The NCAA has always masqueraded its exploitation of student athletes under the guise of free education, and it is anything but news when universities protect their proﬁ  t margins with little regard to the “letter of 
the law.” We pick our spots on our level of outrage 
when it comes to the skewed morality inherent in col-lege athletics — FSU just happens to be a prime target right now.
This isn’t to say that some of the systematic prob-
lems of the sanctity with which football gets treated in Tallahassee aren’t important. 
The problem of sexual assault, however, is now 
getting clouded behind a compounding of relatively 
inconsequential things — like stealing soda from a res-
taurant.
What people need to understand is that these two 
crimes don’t compare, and lumping all of it under the same #BlameJameis Twitter tag deviates the conversa-tion away from what’s truly important.
What matters is the mishandling of the sexual as-
sault charge and what both the Tallahassee Police De-partment and FSU are doing to change the way they 
investigate these type of cases. Everything else is just 
noise.

It’s fall, y’all. The season of 
pumpkin spice lattes, can-dy corn, pumpkin carving 
and a very occasional nip in the air — after all, this is Flor-ida — has fully descended upon us. 
With this season, it seems 
every basic white girl’s wild-est dreams are coming true. I, too, am a basic white girl who loves fall. Sometimes I 
wear ﬂ  annel, drink fancy fall-
ﬂ  avor-infused coffee and use the Pumpkin Harvest soap in my bathroom, which smells 
heavenly. 
However, I have a few au-
tumn musings that don’t fall 
nicely into this wanderlust season that’s sprinkled with 
fake leaves and misted with 
all of the pumpkin scent one could ever want. At times, even the most basic girls 
sometimes just can’t handle 
fall. With that in mind, here are some friendly suggestions for the fall season. 
First, it may be fall, but leg-
gings are still not pants. One might treat them as pants, and you have every right to do so. Please, wear leggings if your heart desires. Just understand that they are not pants. 
Leggings are tight and 
stretchy and, on a good day, might double as yoga pants if you’re lucky. On a bad day, 
they look like tights or fuzzy 
paint plastered over girls’ backsides.
Leggings get a little better 
if one is wearing a relatively 
long shirt, but I’m not sure 
the female species will look back on this fashion decision with fondness. 
Call me old-fashioned, but 
there’s just something about seeing people from behind wearing leggings without a shirt of adequate length that 
isn’t ﬂ  attering for myself or 
the wearer. 
Second, in any SEC col-
lege town, fall means foot-ball. This year, it seems football also means tailgates and games ﬁ  lled with high-
waisted shorts that miss the 
short mark by about 5 miles and move into the “Are you even wearing pants?” terri-tory instead.
There’s no nice way to put 
it: Your butt hanging out of your shorts just isn’t cute. I understand that this is col-
lege, and high-waisted shorts are a popular college trend. 
You probably have a nice butt, and even Meghan Train-or says she’s “bringing booty back” in her new hit single, 
“All About That Bass.”
However, those extra 
inches of padded skin don’t 
make my list of things to see 
on gameday. Orange and 
blue, Albert and Alberta and thousands of fans screaming “Go, Gators!” all make the cut. Your butt does not. 
My third and ﬁ  nal fall ob-
servation concerns skimpy Halloween costumes. They’re old news, but they’re still 
hanging around — or should 
I say, hanging off of their re-spective wearers, despite how stupid they are. 
Again, girls have every 
right to wear an itty-bitty cos-tume if they want to. They’re probably not all that different from clothes worn when go-
ing out on any other night of 
the week. However, it’s still silly. 
If you want to be a cat 
or Minnie Mouse or Super-
woman, be those things, but 
don’t be the scantily-clad version of them because you won’t even look right. Minnie 
Mouse wears a red and white 
polka-dot dress, not black booty shorts and a polka-dot crop top. 
Fall is a fabulous season. 
Pinterest boards come to life. College students double as apple pickers, pumpkin- patch visitors and corn maze 
goers. Basic white girls ev-
erywhere are thriving in their natural habitats, but some-times that thriving gets a little out of hand. 
College students are 
adults. We can all make our own decisions. Yet, in light of these three interesting fall 
trends, and as a basic white 
girl, I personally suggest a lit-tle more class and a little less … well, you know.

Area hospitals have teamed up 
with the Alachua County Fire Res-
cue to update wireless routers in ambulances, making communica-tion between dispatched vehicles 
and hospitals more efficient. 
All fire rescue, UF Health 
Shands and North Florida Re-
gional Medical Center rescue units have had new routers in-stalled, which will maximize the function of existing cardiac moni-tors, radio communication signals and computer connections in each 
emergency vehicle, according to Harold Theus, assistant fire rescue 
chief.
“When it comes to people’s 
lives, there is no time to waste,” 
said Mark Sexton, Alachua Coun-
ty spokesman.
Vehicles were previously 
hooked up to a 3G network, Theus said, which was not as reliable or as fast as the new routers’ 4G LTE access, which cost about $41,200.UF finance sophomore Alex-
andra Hernandez said she was ex-cited to hear about the new router updates.
“I think that anything that is 
helping the patients get well at a more expedited rate makes a posi-tive difference,” said Hernandez, 19.
Theus expects other counties 
to implement this change because of the promising results produced so far. 
“Alachua County has one of 
the best cardiac save rates in the state of Florida, and this system will only add to that,” Theus said. Ambulances get improved wireless

PRETORIA, South Africa — Os-
car Pistorius was sentenced to five 
years in prison Tuesday for kill-ing girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, completing a transformation from 
an acclaimed sprinter at the 2012 
Olympics to a convicted crimi-nal led away in a police van with barred windows.
Wearing a dark suit, the dou-
ble-amputee athlete was subdued when Judge Thokozile Masipa an-nounced the punishment in a Pre-toria courtroom, ending a televised trial that was closely followed at home and abroad by those who once admired him.
The man known as the “Blade 
Runner” because of his carbon-
fiber running blades will have to 
serve 10 months, or one-sixth of his sentence, in prison before he is eli-gible to be moved to house arrest, legal analysts say.
South Africans seemed torn 
between acceptance of the ruling, touted by some 
as an example of judicial ac-countability in a 
nation that shed 
white, racist rule 20 years ago and nagging concern that Pistorius re-ceived leniency 
because he was rich and famous.
“Crime is crime, and you’ll pay 
for it,” said Petrus Lekota, a Johan-
nesburg resident who noted that Pistorius’ well-paid legal team was 
unable to keep him out of jail.
However, law student Yazeed 
Mia was surprised that Masipa had earlier acquitted Pistorius of murder and instead convicted him of the lesser crime of culpable ho-micide, or negligent killing.
In reaching the verdict against 
Pistorius last month, Masipa ac-cepted his account that he acciden-tally shot Steenkamp, a 29-year-old model and television personality, through a closed toilet door in his home after mistaking her for an in-truder on Valentine’s Day 2013.
Still in his suit, Pistorius left the 
courthouse in a police van with caged windows. A crowd gath-ered around, with some whistling, shouting and banging on the sides of the vehicle.
Prosecutors, who were disap-
pointed by the culpable homicide conviction, had requested a 10-year sentence for Pistorius. They said 
they were considering whether to 
appeal the sentence. The defense had argued for house arrest.
A close friend of Steenkamp, 
Gina Myers, wore an image of the slain woman on her clothing.
“I really don’t think any of us 
will heal anytime soon,” Myers said. “There will always be ques-tions.”

ORLANDO, Fla. — Signing up new vot-
ers at high schools and job fairs, Carol Davis 
has noticed that the registrants, especially younger ones, are increasingly choosing neither Democratic or Republican parties.
They instead are picking “No Party Af-
filiation,” and they are hardly alone.
Florida gained more than 600,000 new 
voters since the last gubernatorial election in 2010, and the overwhelming gains came from unaffiliated voters, not members of the two major parties. The choice not to choose was widespread: Unaffiliated voters had gains in every single Florida county. The biggest numeric jumps were in Miami and 
the Interstate 4 corridor, the stretch of high-
way from St. Petersburg to Daytona Beach that holds the key to any statewide victory.
“They say they’re tired of partisan poli-
tics,” said Davis, who does registration drives for the League of Women Voters of Florida. “Some of them said they’re just tired of being bombarded with information 
from a party, and they prefer to be indepen-
dent.”While unaffiliated voters have been in-
creasing around the nation for the past two 
decades, their rise is particularly resonant in 
Florida, the nation’s biggest swing state. It could play a significant role in the outcome of November’s gubernatorial election, and future presidential races, as more voters like 20-year-old Alecsa Kazenas are up for grabs. The University of Central Florida student describes herself as fiscally conservative but 
socially liberal. Being unaffiliated allows her 
to express her disenchantment with how the current political system works without giv-ing up being an active citizen, she said.
“I just don’t feel like I’m in either catego-
ry, so having to choose a party just doesn’t seem right,” said Kazenas, who hasn’t decid-ed if she will vote for incumbent GOP Gov. 
Rick Scott or Democratic challenger Charlie 
Crist, the former Republican governor.

UF researchers are using stem cells on dogs 
in an attempt to cure them of arthritis.
The research uses stem cells from donated 
umbilical cords from dogs, said Kathy Petrucci, 
chief executive officer of California-based Ani-
mal Cell Therapies, whom the university has 
partnered with.
“We started research late last fall in 2013.  We 
conducted a pilot study where we only treated dogs with knee and elbow problems,” she said. “The results were good, so we moved to a con-trol study in March.”
Although the study is still in progress, Petruc-
ci said the findings look favorable.“The pilot study dogs did well,” she said. 
“They showed improved fitness scores and ac-tivity levels.”
UF veterinarians use stem cells from the um-
bilical cords and insert them into the elbow or knee joints of the affected dogs. Then they moni-
tor the dogs for improvement over six months.
A total of 18 dogs out of 150 in the study have 
been treated at UF over the last year.
Petrucci said the research is awaiting FDA 
approval for veterinary businesses to begin us-
ing the treatment on dogs they receive in their clinics, but she is hopeful.
“It’s definitely translatable to humans,” she 
said. “Our next step is field study.”
Merin Reji, a UF biology junior, said the re-
search shows a possible cure for arthritis.
“It seems to me like there are people and re-
search groups out there who are committed to finding the cure for a disease like this,” Reji, 20, said. “I think it’s great that UF is part of it.”Stem cells to cure dog arthritisWEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 22, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 9

Two UF students will present 
their work at a national sustainabil-
ity conference in front of more than 1,000 students Sunday.
Sustainability studies senior 
Alex Ahrenholz and environmen-tal engineering senior Camille Me-kwinski will present at the student summit portion of the Association for the Advancement of Sustain-ability in Higher Education 2014 Convention & Expo in Portland, Oregon.
Allison Vitt, outreach and com-
munications coordinator for the UF Office of Sustainability, wrote in an email that the Office of Sustainabil-ity is proud of the two 21-year-old office interns. 
“This is a very big deal to have 
our students accepted to facilitate a workshop,” Vitt said.
“There are only a few students 
selected from all the abstract sub-missions, and to have our very own UF student interns represented at the premier national conference for sustainability in higher ed is some-thing we’re very proud of,” she added.
The students will present a one-
hour workshop titled “A Hut Trend: 
Student to student engagement en-
abling sustainability,” which will be one of only four workshops pre-sented at the convention.
The workshop will include ac-
tivities, games and prizes for stu-dents attending the conference. 
The workshop will teach stu-
dent leaders how to foster peer-to-peer interactions, equip students 
with tools for creating commitment 
to sustainability among members and talk about ways in which new, sustainable social norms may be developed.
“It’s exciting for the university 
to be present in kind of a bigger format than just like a small poster board,” Ahrenholz said.
Ahrenholz and Mekwinski’s 
workshop will be based on their work at the Office of Sustainability’s sustainability hut, a mobile, solar-paneled contraption used to teach students on campus about how to live environmentally friendly lives.
 Mekwinski and Ahrenholz 
work for the Office of Sustainability to promote ecological living to stu-dents on campus.
“We’re just teaching people that 
(interaction) is a better way to in-
form people about sustainability and sustainability principles than 
just information-based campaigns,” Ahrenholz said.
Mekwinksi said she is excited to 
be showcasing a workshop at the conference in front of her peers. 
Tyler Burkett, a UF chemical 
engineering junior, has visited the on-campus sustainability hut and participated in the activities that Ahrenholz and Mekwinski will be displaying Sunday.    
“I thought it was really interest-
ing,” Burkett, 20, said.
Burkett said she thinks the hut is 
important to inform students about 
sustainability. 
 “We can always do more,” he 
said.

� HBO AND CBS WILL

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
NEW YORK — Cord cutters 
rejoiced last week after HBO 
and CBS announced plans to sell stand-alone streaming ser-vices, a move that cable and sat-
ellite television providers have 
resisted for years.
Customers tired of paying 
big fees for hundreds of chan-nels they never watch just to have access to a few favorite shows might be expected to start canceling cable service in droves. Get Netflix, throw in 
HBO, add a network here and 
there — why would anyone sign up now for cable?
Well, don’t sound the death 
knell for cable companies yet.
Some would-be customers 
may balk when they see just how much paying a la carte ac-tually costs. Stations that offer 
services a la carte will have to 
pay for marketing that the cable and satellite companies usually cover.

could mean less advertising revenue, since online ads are generally cheaper, and that will boost the network’s cost 
of running the channel. And 
smooth streaming costs money: To avoid so-called “throttling” during peak evening viewing times, Netflix buckled to broad-band distributors like Comcast and Verizon and paid up so that its streaming service would run at a higher bandwidth and 
work more smoothly. Those 
added costs might be passed on to customers.
And for all those cable hat-
ers out there, sorry: Cutting the cord won’t mean cutting out your cable provider. They of-ten own some of your favorite channels (Comcast owns NBC Universal, parent of Bravo and USA) and in most areas, they are the gatekeepers to the In-ternet.
Offering popular channels 
like HBO over streaming could actually help cable companies sell more expensive broadband services to customers.
“The cable business is evolv-
ing from mainly selling you a pay-TV package to mainly sell-ing you a broadband Internet 
service,” said FBR Research 
analyst Barton Crockett. “Con-tent companies and cable com-panies are evolving from being very worried about making their content available through Internet services to very excited about that. It’s a way to sell their Internet and get people to 
pay for faster speeds.”
The growth in streaming 
services will appeal “to a seg-
ment of consumers that the tra-ditional pay-TV providers have a harder and harder time com-municating with: the millenni-als and so called ‘cord-nevers’” who haven’t viewed Pay TV as 
a compelling option until now,” 
says MoffettNathanson partner Craig Moffett.
In fact, HBO said its stand-
alone HBO Go service is largely aimed at the 10 million U.S. households that have broad-band Internet service but do not pay for TV.
So as more channels start to 
offer a la carte services, cable providers will shift to focus on their broadband services, Mof-fett thinks.
“Cable companies will be-
come increasingly reliant on broadband and gradually evolve their business models 
to be less and less video-centric 
and more broadband-centric over time,” he said. That leaves satellite pay-TV companies like DirecTV and Dish Network Inc., which have no broadband capability as the “odd man out,” he said.Hold up, cord cutters: 
Cable’s here to stay
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
WASHINGTON — For Amer-
ica’s first ladies, Oscar de la Renta 
was more than just a skilled artist who helped give them a dose of confidence whenever they slipped 
into his dresses, beaded gowns and 
pantsuits. He was also a friend to some of them.
From the teal pantsuit Hillary 
Rodham Clinton wore when she was sworn in as a U.S. senator to a red gown for Nancy Reagan to a gray suit still hanging in Laura Bush’s closet, de la Renta endeared 
himself to some of the most scruti-
nized women in the world, A-list celebrities and first ladies alike by developing a keen sense of what they wanted and needed out of their clothes.
De la Renta died late Monday at 
age 82.
Laura Bush and former President 
George W. Bush mourned the “loss of our dear friend.”
Clinton said her entire family, including former President Bill Clin-ton and daughter Chelsea Clinton and her husband, Marc Mezvinsky, would miss the designer’s “warmth 
and friendship.”
The family’s 
statement recalled 
many happy 
times shared with de la Renta and his widow, An-nette, “especially those spent in his 
beloved Domini-
can Republic.”
Nancy Reagan said de la Renta 
was a “fashion legend,” as well as her friend of nearly 50 years.
“They knew he understood 
them, made them feel comfortable,” said Anita McBride, who was Laura Bush’s chief of staff in the White 
House. “Mrs. Bush always said he 
knew what women needed to look and feel beautiful.”
Michelle Obama, for her part, 
preferred the work of up-and-com-ing designers and chose the then-unknown Jason Wu to design both of her inaugural ball gowns. It took years for her to wear more estab-lished designers, such as Carolina 
Herrera and de la Renta. He had 
criticized her several years earlier for not wearing an American label to a 2011 state dinner for the president of China.
Less than two weeks before 
the famed designer’s death, Mrs. Obama donned a de la Renta de-sign for the first time in her nearly 
six years as first lady. She wore the 
sleeveless black dress, with royal blue and gold appliques from neck-line to hemline, at a reception that followed a fashion education work-shop she held for design students at the White House.
“Oscar de la Renta was a pioneer 
and a visionary who helped genera-
tions of women embrace their most 
beautiful, confident selves,” she said Tuesday.
Besides first ladies, de la Renta 
clothed their daughters, too.
De la Renta gave first ladies fashion

“This is a very big deal to 
have our students accepted 
to facilitate a workshop.”

2015 linebacker recruit decommits from Florida
Four-star recruit Jerome Baker — the No. 5 outside linebacker in 
the 2015 recruiting class according to Rivals.com — ﬂ  ipped his commitment from Florida to Ohio State on Tuesday.Soccer falls in polls
The UF soccer team dropped three places to No. 8 in the NSCAA poll, which was released on Tuesday. Florida lost both of its matches this weekend.UF men’s golf senior J.D. Tomlinson had a career-best outing in Orlando. Read the story on Page 14.GRAHAM HACK

Becky Burleigh’s message to 
her team this week was simple: 
remember who you are.
After starting their Southeast-
ern Conference schedule a per-fect 6-0, the No. 8 Gators (11-4, 6-2 SEC) had a dismal weekend, 
losing games at South Carolina 
and Kentucky — both unranked teams.
Both matches were uncharac-
teristic for Florida, a team that 
has played with patience and 
maturity all season, especially in potential letdown games.
The UF coach believes the is-
sues that resulted in both losses can be ﬁ  xed by getting back to what has made the Gators so suc-cessful this season.
“I think it was just us not quite 
being in sync,” Burleigh said, “and I think the good news about that is I think there’s some stuff that we can ﬁ  x, I think that’s all 
within us to ﬁ  x.” 
“It’s just a matter of more get-ting back to our basics, getting 
back to what we do best, because what we do best, it’s a team game for us. It’s much more of a collec-
tive effort.”
Playing as a team is what has 
made the Gators so dangerous 
this season. Twelve different Gator players have scored the team’s 34 goals, making attacks 
tough to defend for opponents.
But over the weekend — espe-
cially against Kentucky, Florida 
failed to score for the ﬁ  rst time since Sept. 12 — Burleigh said the players began to get frustrat-ed and impatient, and instead of 
allowing the offense to come to 
them, they started trying to make plays individually.
“We all have to trust one an-
other that if we give a ball we’re 
gonna get it. ... We just have to

Burleigh wants Florida soccer team to remember who they are
OTERO’S OPINION
Coming into the 2014 season, UF vol-
leyball coach Mary Wise said Florida was looking to become more domi-
nant on defense.
Now, however, I wouldn’t say Florida 
is completely dominating on the defensive end.
The Gators are 57th in the nation in 
blocks per set (2.43) and 301st in digs per set (12.38).
So why is Wise not rotating her defensive 
specialists around more to create a bigger 
defensive presence?
With three seniors – libero Holly Pole and 
defensive specialists Taylor Unroe and Mad-
dy Monserez – the team is loaded with expe-
rience in the back row, so it’s understandable 
why those three receive most of the playing time.
However, even with all the experience 
that those three seniors provide, there are 
still three defensive specialists — Lindsey 
Rogers, Sam Dubiel and Nikki O’Rourke — that aren’t playing as much who are just as capable of playing at the level Unroe and 
Monserez are playing. 
So why is Wise choosing to stick so close-
ly to the seniors?
My editor posed this question to me the 
other day.
It’s a fair question. Human nature says that we want to 
know why we can’t see what these other 
players are capable 
of.
So, I’ll give you 
my slightly compli-
cated response.
I think Wise has played the three seniors 
so much not just because they have a wealth 
of experience, but also because getting your freshmen prepared for collegiate volleyball 
is a big feat.
At the beginning of the season, fresh-
men outside hitter Carli Snyder and middle 
blocker Rhamat Alhassan continued to tell 
reporters how much faster the speed of the 
game is and they’ve both seen ample play-ing time.
If it was fast for them and they’ve already 
appeared in the starting lineup, then how 
fast is it for defenders who are expected to 
be everywhere at all times?
Also, Dubiel – the defensive specialist 
that Wise has said is the best ﬂ  oat server 
she’s ever seen – has been recovering from 
a strained abdominal muscle; understand-ably she’s only played in a total of two sets because of it.
To add, it was incredibly useful to hold UF not utilizing back-row depth
◗ THEY WILL PLAY AT A NEUTRAL 
SITE.

Florida fans get a break from the down-
ward spiral that is the 2014 season thanks 
to a bye this weekend. But fear not col-lege football fans, there are plenty of other games to enjoy throughout the weekend. 
No. 6 Oregon @ California — Fri-
day, 10pm, Fox Sports 1
Oregon has won the last ﬁ  ve games 
in this series, but California is currently third in the PAC-12 North standings. A win for the Bears at a neutral site — the game is being played at the new Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, California, — would shatter Oregon’s playoff hopes. 
No. 1 Mississippi State @ Ken-
tucky — Saturday, 3:30pm, CBS
Top-ranked Mississippi State trav-
els to Lexington, Kentucky, to take on a Kentucky team that is one of the most 
improved in the Southeastern Confer-
ence. 
The Bulldogs are currently a 13.5-
point favorite, but they have a target 
on their back being the No. 1 team in 
the land.
An upset victory for Kentucky 
would undoubtedly be a signature 
win for second-year head coach Mark 
Stoops. 
No. 3 Ole Miss @ No. 24 LSU — 
Saturday, 7:15pm, ESPN
Ole Miss showed some slight vul-
nerabilities last week against Ten-
nessee by not being able to score any points until late in the second quarter. 
The Rebels then went on to roll 
35-3. 
This week, Ole Miss  gets a big road 
test traveling to Death Valley for a night game — one of the toughest en-vironments to win no matter how good a team you are. Oregon-Cal opens up Week 
9 of college football Friday

Twenty-ﬁ  ve former Gators were active 
during Week 7 of NFL action. Here are a 
few highlights from the weekend.
Percy Harvin, New York Jets: While 
Harvin did not play this week after be-
ing traded to the New York Jets from the 
Seattle Seahawks on Friday, he did speak to reporters on Tuesday for the ﬁ  rst time since the trade.
Harvin told CBS New York that he felt 
welcomed by the Jets and is ready for a fresh start with the Jets after being traded by Seattle for a conditional draft pick.
Carlos Dunlap, Cincinnati Bengals:  
Dunlap continues to wreak havoc as the central cog of the Bengals’ defensive line. In Cincinnati’s 27-0 loss to the Indianapolis Colts, the ﬁ  fth-year defensive end totaled ﬁ  ve tackles, a sack and a forced fumble while also defending a pass. On the sea-son, Dunlap leads the Bengals and is tied for 15th in the NFL with four sacks. 
Sharrif Floyd, Minnesota Vikings:  
Floyd had the best individual performance of his young NFL career during Minneso-ta’s 17-16 loss to the Buffalo Bills. The 2013 ﬁ  rst-round draft pick recorded a personal-best ﬁ  ve tackles while starting his sixth game of the season at defensive tackle. Floyd also recorded his second sack of the season while the Vikings as a whole had six sacks on Bills quarterback Kyle Orton on Sunday.
Jordan Reed, Washington Redskins: 
Reed was active for the second straight game after missing four contests with a hamstring injury. The second-year tight end tallied 54 receiving yards on a team-high-tying ﬁ  ve receptions in Washington’s 19-17 win against the Tennessee Titans on 
Sunday. In the two games since returning 
from the hamstring injury, Reed leads the 
Redskins with 13 catches.
Jonotthan Harrison, Indianapolis 
Colts: Harrison started his third straight 
game at center for the Colts in their 27-0 
win over the Bengals on Sunday.
Harrison, an undrafted free agent and 
former UF starting center, anchored an of-
fensive line that allowed Colts quarterback Andrew Luck to amass 344 passing yards and be sacked just twice. Indianapolis also gained 171 yards on the ground.
Other notables: Ravens Safety Will Hill 
made his season debut on Sunday after missing six games for violating the NFL’s substance abuse policy. The third-year vet-eran recorded two tackles — including one for loss — in the Baltimore Ravens’ 29-7 win against the Atlanta Falcons. 
After missing just one ﬁ  eld goal through 
his ﬁ  rst ﬁ  ve games this season, Miami Dol-phins kicker Caleb Sturgis went 2 for 4 in the Dolphins’ 27-14 win against the Chica-go Bears. Sturgis is now 11 for 14 on ﬁ  eld 
goal attempts this season.14, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 22, 2014

Entering the third tournament 
of the season, J.D. Tomlinson was 
looking for more consistency in his play.
During the tour-
nament, Tomlinson was consistent and then some.
The senior ﬁ  nished the Tavis-
tock Collegiate Invitational in a tie for third place at 10-under-par, after carding a 6-under, 66 in the ﬁ  nal round at the Lake Nona Golf & Country Club in Orlando.
His third-place performance 
ties his career-best ﬁ  nish, which was set at the Shoal Creek Intercol-legiate in 2013. Tomlinson’s three day score of 206 is the best in his career.
“It was just an absolute plea-
sure watching him,” coach J.C. Deacon said in a release. “He put on a clinic out there, so that was really nice to see. Hopefully that 
gets his conﬁ  dence going to spark 
a big-time year.”
Meanwhile, Florida ﬁ  nished 
the three-day event in 11th place 
at 2-under-par, which was 35 shots 
behind No. 3 Florida State, which 
took home the tournament title as 
it ﬁ  nished the tournament at 37-under-par.
Even though the Gators had their best round of the tournament, Deacon said the team can continue to grow. 
“We didn’t ﬁ  nish well. … We 
were right in the thick of it for 
sixth, seventh, eighth place there 
for a while, but we just let it go at the end a little, which was disap-pointing,” Deacon said. “But, it 
was a big, big step in the right di-
rection.”
Florida State won by two strokes 
over No. 16 Vanderbilt. The Com-
modores, however, had the two 
best individual player ﬁ  nishes in 
Orlando.
Freshman Ryan Celano was the 
second-best player for the Gators 
in the tournament as he ﬁ  nished at 3-over-par, shooting a 1-over 73 on the ﬁ  nal day. Senior Thomas Stewart shot a 5-over 77 in the last round, after entering the round at 
even-par.
After struggling the ﬁ  rst two 
days of the event, junior A.J. 
Crouch bounced back in the ﬁ  -
nal round with a 2-under 70. The 
Jacksonville native completed the tournament at 6-over-par, good 
enough to tie for 58th place.
Senior Eric Banks found him-
self in trouble on the par-4 seventh hole in the ﬁ  nal round. Banks was 
1-over-par on the day entering the hole and then proceeded to card a quadruple bogey. 
Banks ﬁ  nished the tournament 
at 7-over-par.
With one more tournament to 
go in the fall season, Deacon thinks the team has a strong chance of 
getting a win. 
“I think they should go down 
and compete for the title,” Deacon 
said. “The ﬁ  eld is not as strong as some of the one’s we’ve played in 
so far, and I think all of the guys 
are starting to play some of their 
better golf. We’re coming together as a group, and I think they should be very competitive.”
Tomlinson has career-best tournament as Florida ﬁ  nishes ninth
UF Golf “It was a big, big step in 
the right direction.” 
J.C. Deacon
UF coachcontinue to emphasize that,” Burleigh said. 
“The more we move the defense, the 
more we find gaps. The more we keep the 
ball in one place, whether it’s because we 
don’t switch it, because we dribble ... the less things are going to happen.”
Florida’s coaches will look to use the full 
week of practice — a rarity this season — to regain form before facing Tennessee on se-
nior night on Friday. 
Burleigh said be-
cause the entire team 
has such respect for the 
senior class, lack of motivation is the last 
thing she’s worried about heading into the match.
“This is an unbelievable senior class,” 
she said. “They are a group that we’re heav-ily indebted to for the culture of our pro-gram, and I know that they’re gonna be mo-tivated, and I know that the other players 
are gonna be really motivated to send them 
off in a good way.”
The senior class has eight players in all, 
and Burleigh will be leaning on that lead-
ership to help right the ship and get the 
Gators back on the right track.
With only three regular season games 
left, there isn’t much time to do so, but Bur-leigh believes in her team and how they will respond to the adversity.
“I really have full trust in this team,” 
she said. “I think they’re mature, they un-
derstand what we’re trying to do, they’re 
bought in to what we’re trying to do, and sometimes you need a situation like this to really bring you back to reality.”Rebels quarterback Bo Wallace hasn’t 
thrown an interception since the fifth 
week of the season, a key to Ole Miss’ 
successful ascension to No. 3 in the coun-
try. This week will determine in a hostile 
environment if Wallace’s turnover issues are really behind him. 
No. 4 Alabama @ Tennessee — Sat-
urday, 7:30pm, ESPN2What was once one of the best rival-
ries in the SEC many years ago has lost a lot of its luster thanks to the Crimson Tide’s continued dominance and the Vols’ trend downward. 
This is also former Tennessee head 
coach Lane Kiffin’s first return to Ney-land Stadium since his disastrous stint in Knoxville in the 2009-10 season. 
While he usually coordinates the 
Crimson Tide’s offense from the side-line, there has been speculation that he’ll coach from the booth for this one. South Carolina @ No. 5 Auburn - 
Saturday, 7:30pm, SEC Network
South Carolina has fallen off the radar 
after compiling three SEC East losses, but as Auburn head coach Gus Malzahn said this week, the Gamecocks were ranked in the Top 10 in the preseason for a rea-son. Spurrier gets a chance to prove he’s still got some life left in him by keeping it close, and even more so if pulls off the upset.

O’Rourke, Dubiel, Rogers seeing 
little to no playing time this year
Dubiel out as long as Wise did because once 
she did debut, her float serve during Flori-da’s match against Texas A&M — the only 
ranked Southeastern Conference opponent 
Florida has faced yet.
And O’Rourke has recently started wear-
ing a knee brace. She’s said to have tweaked 
her knee, so the brace makes sense. 
But this can also affect Wise’s game plan 
for next season.
With Pole leaving, O’Rourke — the only 
defensive specialist returning next season who is not a freshman — is likely to assume 
the libero position. 
If O’Rourke is facing knee problems, the 
trainers and Wise will be looking to keep 
her rested so their program doesn’t lose it’s 
future libero to some knee injury that could take a year to two to fix.
While O’Rourke is taking it easy, it’s im-
portant to note the role she played on Flori-da’s defense in 2013.
The then-sophomore competed in 76 sets 
and 28 matches. She finished the season 
with 18 service aces and 1.82 digs per set — 
a higher mark than Monserez averaged in 2013 (1.53).
But we’re still missing freshman defen-
sive specialist – and former outside hitter 
for her club team – Rogers.
My only thought is that she was an out-
side hitter before coming to Florida there-
fore Wise feels she needs a little more work 
before throwing her into a match.
Of the freshman, Rogers is the one that 
has been talked about least, but is still re-
ferred to as a big puzzle piece for next sea-son’s squad.
With no explanation for why Rogers isn’t 
playing other than inexperience in not just the position but also in collegiate volleyball, I will leave you with these last words:
Just trust Wise because as history shows, 
she knows best.coluMn , from page 13UF Soccer16, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 22, 2014

Alligator Staff Writer @EricaAlyssa
Chris Chiozza is just one of 
many new faces to the Gators’ 17-
man 2014-2015 men’s basketball 
roster. 
The Tennessee native is not 
the tallest nor the heaviest on the 
team — the freshman point guard 
weighs in at 168 pounds and is 
exactly 6-feet tall — but Chiozza said he’s working on getting his weight up to 175 pounds by the start of the season. 
He said he’s gained 10 pounds 
since he’s arrived at UF.
During his senior year at his 
Memphis (Tenn.) White Station 
High School, Chiozza averaged 15 
points and eight assists per game. 
Ranked No. 45 in the country 
by Rivals.com, Chiozza also re-ceived offers to play at Auburn, U 
Mass, Memphis, Ohio State, Rich-
mond and Tennessee.
Here are six questions for the 
Florida freshman. 
1.)   Who is your closest friend 
on the team?
“Devin Robinson, I knew him 
before we got here. We met each 
other at camps in the summer of 
junior year and we were both get-ting recruited by Florida so we used to talk about thinking about coming here. And I had com-
mitted before him so then once I 
committed he was just like ‘Well I might as well go there.’ So we knew each other our whole senior 
year and we got here together in 
the summer and we were room-mates.”
2.)   Has anyone stood out to 
you during off-season workouts as taking on more of a leadership role?
“Michael Frazier, deﬁ  nitely. 
Jon Horford, he’s a really good leader. He’s always talking and just telling people where to be at all times. He’s one of the more experienced people on the team 
even though he hasn’t been here, 
he’s been in college in Michigan, he’s a real nice leader. I look up to him a lot.
3.)   How’s your ball han-
dling?
“I work on that, you know, 
you still got to work on that. I’ve 
always kind of been a better ball 
handler so I don’t work on it as much as my jumper but I deﬁ  nite-ly still work on it.
4.)   What’s your favorite 
Gainesville restaurant?
“Mi Apa. I get some empana-
das. I try to switch it up, I don’t re-ally ever get the same thing twice, 
except for empanadas, I start off 
with those.”
5.)   What’s your all-time fa-
vorite movie?“Space Jam. Michael Jordan 
and cartoons: mix them together and it’s the perfect movie.”
6.)   How have you enjoyed 
living in Gainesville so far?“It’s lovely, I like the weath-
er—it’s a lot better than Memphis. It’s just a great environment. Just people knowing who you are when you get off campus. Just 
great fans. I like it already.”
Six questions with freshman point guard Chris Chiozza
