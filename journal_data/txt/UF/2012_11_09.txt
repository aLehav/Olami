UF President Bernie Machen 
addressed all students, faculty 
and staff Thursday in an email regarding race relations at the university.
The email comes after a 
town hall meeting when stu-dents brought ideas to try to fix what they believe is a lack of knowledge about cultural history , specifically blackface. The meeting was a response to the Oct. 24 incident in which two Beta Theta Pi Fraternity brothers covered their bodies in blackface makeup to represent rappers at a social.In the email, Machen ex-
pressed his opinions on the matter.
“I personally share the 
anger and hurt voiced by many of those in at-tendance and believe that 
demeaning any race is intolerable,” he wrote 
in the email. “This conduct is completely counter to UF’s in-stitutional values and commit-ment to create a welcoming and inclusive environment.”
Machen also wrote that ini-tiatives are underway to im-prove understanding of racial differences.
These include creating an 
African-American studies ma-jor, developing a cultural train-ing module for faculty and staff, developing diversity training for students, and broaden-ing the scope of the Common Reading Program to cover race and culture.
UF spokeswoman Janine 
Sikes said the email was a re-sponse to the town hall meet-ing.

On Wednesday , Marielis Nieves 
thought all she had to look forward to for 
the rest of the day was a two-hour drive with her father from Gainesville back home to St. Marys, Ga.
She never expected to be $2,500 rich-
er.
Nieves, 18, was in a meeting with 
four other students of UF’s Innovation Academy, an enrollment model in which students attend classes only during the Spring and Summer semesters, when Jim Trebilcock, chief marketing officer for Dr. Pepper, knocked on the door.
Trebilcock came into the room and 
awarded Nieves $2,500 because of her video entry into the Dr. Pepper Tuition Giveaway.
“I can’t believe this is happening,” she 
said.
In Nieves’ minute-long video, she 
described why she deserved the scholar -
ship, which ended with her dumping a 2-liter bottle of Dr. Pepper on her head.
In addition to $2,500, Nieves won a ticket to the SEC Championship game in Atlanta where, during halftime, she will have the chance to win a $100,000 schol-arship.
To win the $100,000, Nieves must 
throw a football into a Dr. Pepper-shaped net, which is about 2 feet wide, in under 30 seconds.
She said she will have to start practic-
ing her throw with her father soon.
Henry Nieves, 47, said his daughter 
played softball for six years and soccer for a year, so he likes her chances. 
Nieves said he was proud of her drive 
to make the video, which she did by her -
self, and always taught her to work hard no matter what. 
He said he was in Gainesville not only 
with his daughter, but to also work out his daughter’s financial aid situation.
Nieves is a Navy contractor, but busi-
ness hasn’t been good. With every set-back, he said, his daughter always looked to more scholarships.
“She didn’t give up.”He said his daughter’s ability to go to 
college was on the fence because of the family’s financial situation.
And then Jim Trebilcock knocked.Contact Ben Brasch at bbrasch@alligator.

For UF students, the Muschamp Stare and 
Tebowing are more than just entertaining oc-
currences on the football field. Game discus-sion continues long after the stadium lights shut off. Fans live for the Saturdays when they can pause their private lives and head for The Swamp, where they’ll join together in orange and blue for a common cause: cheering on the Gators.
College football makes a huge impact on 
the unity of a school’s Student Body, accord-ing to an article published in USA Today. The article said football has grown into the coun-try’s favorite sport to watch. Forty-one percent of viewers declared it their favorite, according to a 2008 Gallup Poll.
UF is no exception.“I hear someone talking about football ev-
ery day ,” said Brielle Speranzini, a 19-year-old accounting sophomore at UF. “When some-thing big happens, like Muschamp freaking out at halftime, you hear about it instantly.”
For Andrew Rosenberg, a 19-year-old busi-
ness and sports management sophomore, sharing feelings about football is an important part of his college experience.
“On game days it can get pretty rowdy 
down in The Swamp, but that’s the fun of it,” he said.
Game days are a part of the college lifestyle 
even at rival schools.
At Florida State University, thousands of 
students in garnet and gold walk to the sta-dium doing the Seminole chop and war chant, said Riley Hays, a 20-year-old environmental studies and geography senior at FSU.
“It brings the whole campus together for 
those three and a half hours,” she said. “No one worries about anything but football for a while.”
For Florida colleges without football teams, 
school spirit can be hard to find.
Scott Shuman, a 21-year-old entrepreneur -
ship junior at the University of Tampa, said that many students don’t always support the teams that his school sponsors.
The University of Tampa tries to draw 
students to sporting events by promoting free giveaways, but these are only “slightly successful” at basketball and lacrosse events, Shuman said.
He said many students go to the University 
of South Florida’s football games instead.However, Shuman said that even though 
school spirit is minimal, the Student Body does unite over academics and organizations.
At schools with large student bodies, hav-
ing a football team can bring them together, he said. But at smaller schools, “we rally on 90 different things, rather than just one,” Shuman said.
Stetson University is bringing back its foot-
ball program and looks at it as a way to draw in students and the community . Stetson wants to increase enrollment, awareness and hype on campus, said Ricky Hazel, assistant athletic director for athletic communications.
The college’s last year with a football pro-
gram was 1956. The new program will play in the Pioneer Football League, according to Stetson’s website.
A football field and a 6,000-seat stadium 
were built for the program’s launch, which is scheduled for Fall 2013, he said.
The school put on football scrimmage 
games for Stetson’s homecoming week, and about 3,000 people came out to support the new team, Hazel said.
He said he believes the new football pro-
gram will make students’ college experience more intimate.
“There’s nothing like college football to 
bring students, alumni and the community together,” Hazel said.
No matter the size of the school or the divi-
sion it plays in, football is a part of America’s youth culture today and is important to have in colleges, said Ross Baugher, a 19-year-old mechanical engineering freshman at UF.
“Football conferences have really grown in 
the last couple years,” he said. “It’s a sport that anyone can be involved in, and it unites stu-dents even past their college years.”FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 9, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 5

President Barack Obama’s re-
election has prompted strong feel-
ings both around the world and on UF’s campus.
And although the campaign 
commercials are over, the results from this year’s election have brought a series of firsts in history that are still sinking in for student organizations at UF.
Tuesday’s results included the 
largest amount of women ever seated in the U.S. Congress, three states’ approval of same-sex mar -
riage and two state’s legalization of marijuana for recreational use.
UF Women’s Student Associa-
tion President Marla Munro, 20, said she thought the record num-ber of women that were elected this year was a “great feat.”
With the start of the new legisla-
tive session in January, women will hold 20 seats in the Senate and a re-cord high of at least 77 in the House of Representatives, according to a Center for American Women and Politics press release.
“But we have a long way to go 
before we achieve true equality and fair representation of women in our government,” said Munro, a women’s studies junior.Bridget Siegel, a 20-year-old re-
ligion junior and president of UF’s Pride Student Union, had to switch back and forth from watching the 
polling result to 
an episode of “Sons of Anar -
chy.”
“It was get-
ting too stress-ful,” she said. “I needed a distrac-tion.”
To Siegel, the night was a vic-
tory for the LGBTQ community.
Maine, Maryland and Washing-
ton became the first states to ap-prove same-sex marriage by a pop-ular vote. Another victory came from Tammy Baldwin’s seat in the Senate, making her the nation’s first openly gay politician to win.
Siegel said finding out the vot-
ers wanted to recognize same-sex marriage made “everything in my life kind of blow up in happiness.”
“Acceptance from leaders in this 
country is a great thing,” she said.
Colorado passed Amendment 64 
and Washington passed Initiative 502, which legalizes marijuana for recreational use and sales. People older than 21 can possess and con-sume up to an ounce of marijuana, and individuals can grow up to six marijuana plants in Colorado.Guy Ginton, president of 
NORML Gators, the UF chapter for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, said he was excited to hear the results.
“It’s important to remember that 
prohibition ended on a state level,” he said. “I think it will be a struggle until more states get on board.”
Ginton, a 20-year-old economics 
junior, said he hopes the decision can bring an end to the drug war.
“It is impossible to die from 
marijuana — you can’t overdose on it,” he said. “The only deaths caused by marijuana are the laws making it illegal.”

75% NOLessons from Florida election results
Despite President Obama’s re-election being ofﬁ  cially 
projected just after 11 p.m. on Tuesday , ballots were still being counted well after in Florida, where voters 
waited in lines well past midnight.
This is a national shame.No one in this nation should have to wait in line for hours 
simply to vote — and yet Florida was the only state in which this was the case. At least during the recount ﬁ  asco in 2000, the outcome of the election was in our state’s hands. America watched on the edge of its seat as Florida screwed up.
This time, Florida screwed up and it didn’t even matter. 
Since Obama won the necessary 270 electoral votes without it, and Romney couldn’t have won the election even if he had gotten it, our state again stood out as an embarrassment as we continued to count votes a day after a victor was declared.
Of course, one of the key lessons to be taken from this 
mess is the need to invest time and resources into perfect-ing an efﬁ  cient and secure means of voting electronically. We need to ﬁ  nd a viable way of bringing voting into the 21st century.
However, Florida’s troubles weren’t accidental by any 
means. They were mostly self-inﬂ  icted by Gov. Rick Scott and the Republican-dominated legislature, whose repugnant attempts to suppress the vote backﬁ  red. Rather than steal the election for Romney, cutting early voting from 14 to eight days simply led to a massive inﬂ  ux of absentee ballots and the maddeningly long lines in South Florida.
It even led to the president subtly denouncing the long 
lines in his victory speech early Wednesday morning: “By the way, we have to ﬁ  x that.”
There is no question that Florida needs to get its act to-
gether. If we’re ever to cease being the laughingstock of the country during election season, we need to elect ofﬁ  cials who truly value democracy.
Gov . Scott and Florida Republicans evidently don’t hold 
this value, as their efforts to suppress the vote by pushing ID laws, burdening registration drives, cutting the days for early voting and purging legitimate voters from the rolls are anything but democratic.
Election-night debacle aside, Florida Democrats, liberals and progressives have much to be happy about. 
Most notably, it appears Presi-
dent Obama has again won the state, since as of Wednesday he was up by almost 50,000 votes. Al-though this is slim margin of only about 0.7 percent, it’s a winning margin nonetheless.
In addition, Florida Democrats 
made net gains in the legislature. Republicans still vastly out-number them, but their gains of two seats in the state Senate and possibly ﬁ  ve in the House will topple the GOP’s superm-ajority, which will (hopefully) compel Republicans to coop-erate in a much more bipartisan way in the years ahead.
On the federal level, liberals should be happy to know 
that Rep. Corrine Brown (D-3) and Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-20) were re-elected by healthy margins, while former one-term congressman and progressive hero Alan Grayson was again elected to the House in the Orlando-Kissimmee area.
Possibly more reason to celebrate is odious Tea Party 
ﬁ  rebrand Rep. Allen West’s (R-22) defeat to Democratic chal-lenger Patrick Murphy. One term was more than enough for this McCarthyite.
Lastly, but equally as important, most of the proposed 
amendments to the Florida Constitution were voted down.
The amendments — placed on the ballot by Republicans 
— not only contributed to the late-night troubles, as the high number of them made voting and vote-counting signiﬁ  -cantly harder, but they also proposed a host of detrimental measures that would have endangered women’s reproduc-tive rights, the separation of church and state, the expansion of health care coverage, and the integrity of our court system, among others.
These victories should ﬁ  ll lefties with hope. It’s a sign that 
even in the Deep South, progressives can prevail. Now, if only our state could learn how to vote …

When President Obama was re-elected, there was not so much a scream of celebration as there was a giant “PHEW.” It feels like we really dodged a bullet there. Four more years of a really ador-able and wonderful family in the White House. We give a thank-god-it-didn’t-come-down-to-Florida LAUREL to America.
Hurricane Sandy was a real witch; that storm completely ru-
ined Halloween and also the northeastern coast. Another huge storm is headed that way. A Nor’easter is walloping our neigh-bors to the north, sending a lot of cold winds and snow all over the place. We give a way-to-kick-us-when-we’re-down DART  
to Mother Nature.
If you’re a fan of NBC’s “Parks and Recreation,” then you 
probably know about Leslie Knope’s crush on Vice President Joe Biden. Obama called him the “Happy Warrior” during his acceptance speech on Tuesday night (technically early Wednes-day morning, thanks to some brat who locked himself in a ho-tel room). Biden will appear on next week’s episode of “Parks,” much to Leslie’s delight. We give a this-is-a-“big-efﬁ  ng-deal”-to-us-we-can-hardly-wait LAUREL to Joe Biden.
Don’t ignore that email from Twitter that you might have re-
ceived on Thursday. It accidentally reset a bunch of passwords that it didn’t mean to; be careful, make sure that you pay atten-tion to the links in the email. Some hackers might take advan-tage of the confusion to send you something phishy . We give a we-thought-we-could-trust-Twitter-with-our-deepest-secrets-guess-not DART to Twitter. Can we not trust anything any-
more?! Yeesh. Maybe we should all give up on social media and start reading more books.
So many fun things were voted on during the election! Yeah, 
for those of you who weren’t aware, there’s a lot more on the ballot than just who should win America’s Next Top President. Congratulations to all of the states who passed amendments to allow marriage equality! We give a that’s-deﬁ  nitely-a-step-in-the-right-direction LAUREL to America. Again. We will give 
America as many Laurels as we damn well please!
Until we give America a Dart. Some of you might be aware 
of Hank. He’s a cat. He ran a campaign for a senate seat in Vir-ginia. His platform was “Jobs, Animal Rescue / Spay & Neuter programs, and Positive Campaign Reform.” He won 6,000 votes — which placed him third in that senate race. We give a you-weren’t-supposed-to-actually-vote-for-a-cat DART to America. 
Hank is super cute and all, but he’s probably not ﬁ  t for senate duty. Talk to us when Lil Bub is on the ballot. 
Reminder: the world is going to end next month. The Ma-
yans may have actually been onto something, despite the sensa-tional aspect of the previous sentence. Sporadic climate change could have brought down their empire, and that’s what they could have picked up on in the future we’re living in. We give a suckers-we-told-you-climate-change-was-real LAUREL to the 
Mayans.
Have a wonderful Homecoming weekend, and Go Gators!

We are living in exciting times.
Things are different today than 
they’ve ever been in the history 
of the world, and they’re changing all of the 
time.
When I was in elementary school, to 
have a cellphone with a color screen was a big deal. Now, in college, it’s standard for phones to have Internet access and make you pancakes.
Most of us live more comfortably than 
the kings of old did. In fact, trends show that there has been a clear increase in lifespan and income in nearly all countries over the course of the last 200 years. 
Think of the technology that we use every 
day. For the majority of human history, those things didn’t exist.
The printing press didn’t exist until 1448. 
It took about 400 years after that for the tele-graph to be invented. The time between the telegraph being invented and the Internet ap-pearing in the public, however, is only about 200 years. 
For most of human history, we didn’t even 
have farming.
I think that as our understanding of the world increases and as our level of technol-ogy increases, we are able to develop more and more quickly. Some futurist thinkers, such as Ray Kurzweil and Vernor Vinge, ob-serve models of accelerating growth and pre-dict a turning point: the Singularity. 
What is the Singularity?This is going to sound like science ﬁ  ction, 
but trust me, it’s not. It will happen in our lifetimes, and we’d better be ready for it.
The Singularity is the point at which we’re 
able to create computers that are more intel-ligent than humans, and not just one human, but all of humanity. At that point, which has been predicted to be sometime in the next 20 to 30 years, our level of technology will be as-tounding already. 
For example, Kurzweil predicts that we’ll 
have nanobots ﬂ  owing through our veins, maintaining optimum functioning of our bodies. 
Google’s exciting augmented reality glass-
es that so many of us are waiting for could very well be old news by then, too. Those are expected to be available in only a few years. 
So imagine what will happen when a 
single machine is smarter than we are. What new moral dilem-mas will arise?
Will we see 
the technology as alive?
What will hap-
pen to us as our bodies move to-ward steel and away from carbon? Will we enter a 
dark posthuman future or a bright tran-shuman frontier? Will we be more loving and empathetic than ever, or will we lose those feelings?
We can’t tell. It’s like humanity’s discov-
ery of ﬁ  re. Everything changed. Everything is changing.
Who could have predicted that the dis-
covery of ﬁ  re would lead to the construction of the Empire State Building?
We must contemplate the implications of 
having such power. We can’t be unprepared and just let the future hit us in the face. We have to be ready for this.
Don’t just laugh this off.I’m sure there were people chuckling when scientists predicted that computers would beat chess champions in a game of chess.  I’m sure people would have laughed if you had told them about Skyrim in the days of Pong.
Read up on the future. Ask yourself where 
you’ll stand on the upcoming moral dilem-mas.
Just as important, though, is the need for 
scientists in public ofﬁ  ce. The future will be saturated in science, and we can’t have the scientiﬁ  cally illiterate making policy deci-sions.
Remember when Ted Stevens said that the 
Internet was a “series of tubes”? Hilarious.
We’re coming to a point when such igno-
rance will have dire consequences. We must hold ourselves and our policymakers to a higher standard if we’re going to survive the coming century.
Will we have the knowledge and wisdom 
to navigate the changing landscape success-fully? Sitting back isn’t going to cut it.
We’d better get busy reading or get busy 
dying.

Gainesville resident Josh Thompson, 23, drinks a mug of Big Nose beer 
at Mars Pub and Arcade on Wednesday night.

After a tear-stricken closing 
night at Mars Pub and Arcade, six 
regulars decided they didn’t want to see their favorite bar close.
“All of us looked around at 
each other,” said Dave Michael, one of the new owners, “and said, ‘What can we do to turn this around?’”
So they bought the bar, made 
some renovations and reopened three weeks later.
Michael, 38, swept his arm 
across his bar, pointing at new neon lights that glinted off his wide eyes.
Mars Pub and Arcade was 
once known for its backroom laser tag, but the previous owners did away with the laser tag earlier this year. The new owners remade the bar’s image, adding stages and spaces for local artwork.
The team built an art gallery 
where local artists can display and sell their work in the room where laser tag equipment was once stored.
The bar, which reopened on 
Oct. 11, now has a stage for bands, which is raised off the ground and equipped with a full sound sys-tem and LED light display. Mi-chael said the bar is planning to host live performances on Thurs-day, Friday and Saturday nights.
Michael said they built a re-
stroom backstage for bands and are adding a washer, dryer and shower soon.
“We’re trying to find out every 
way to make this great for musi-cians,” said Michael, who is a member of local band Bang Bang Boom.
One of the bar managers, 
James Barratt, pointed out a sec-ond bar by the stage, which will only sell cans of beer. It was made by bartender Travis Martin so that “everyone can have a beer during a show,” Barratt said.
Other improvements include 
a fresh coat of paint, a new food menu and chalkboard walls in the bathroom so people will have erasable spaces to write on, rather than the walls. All renovations were done in three weeks.
“We basically lived here,” Bar -
ratt said. “I never want to see an-other Hot Pocket.”Still, Barratt was enthusiastic 
to help rebuild and reopen the place that kept his favorite beer, Beck’s, in the bar just for him.
“It’s like a second living room 
kind of place,” he said. “It sucks when your living room closes down.”
Patrons and band members 
said they’re excited that Mars won’t be closing for good. Ian Bernacett, guitarist of Thee Holy Ghosts, which frequents Mars, said he’s stoked that the bar re-opened.
“It’s the only place in town 
where we can book our own shows,” said Bernacett, 22.
For now, employees and own-
ers are working together to con-tinue improvements, Michael said, adding that the bar is em-ployee-owned and operated.
“Everybody has a say in how 
it operates,” Michael said. “It’s all a learning process.”
Barratt agreed.“We wanted it to be a place 
that takes care of the bands, takes care of the patrons, takes care of the staff,” he said. “We want to do things the right way.”

Students who ask the Later Gator’s 
bus drivers to turn up the temperature 
this winter can expect the cold shoul-der.
The Regional Transit System bus 
service that routinely transports peo-ple to and from Midtown and down-town will continue to keep its air con-ditioning on at 65 degrees in the colder months.
“In the evenings, even in the win-
ter time, drivers will not run the heat,” said Chip Skinner, RTS marketing and communications supervisor. “The cold has a calming effect and psychologi-cally reduces conflicts and illnesses related to heavy consumption of alco-hol.”
He said drivers normally have the 
air conditioning on at night because the cold reduces the gag reflex.
Skinner said the heating and cool-
ing system only has two settings: on or off.
Students notice the bone-chilling 
temperature when they step on the bus.
“The last time I rode the Later Gator 
I was freezing,” said Lauren Baker, 18, animal science freshman. “I was with my friend, and we were both just wear-ing tank top dresses and wedges.”Skinner said RTS gets a few calls 
every year complaining about the tem-perature. He offered advice for riders braving a cold bus.
“Dress appropriately,” Skinner 
said. “Even in the summer months, take a lightweight jacket or sweater with you so you can be comfortable aboard the bus.”10, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 9, 2012

Gainesville might not get snow this holiday season, 
but it’s getting an ice rink.
In two weeks, Bo Diddley Community Plaza will 
be transformed into a winter wonderland where 
Gainesville residents can enjoy ice skating for the first time in five years.
The rink, dubbed Plaza Ice Palace, will open Nov. 
23 and run until Jan. 6. Participants can glide from 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. on weekdays and from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. on weekends.
One hour of skating costs $10 per person and in-
cludes skate rental. If patrons bring their own skates, admission is $7.
Prior to 2007, the city offered an ice rink on Bo 
Diddley, but it had to be slashed from the budget because it became unaffordable, said David Ballard, events coordinator for City Parks, Recreation and Cul-tural Affairs. In the past, he said, companies expected the city to pay large sums up front and to operate the exhibit the whole season.
“The bids for the ice rink were extremely high, and 
the companies wanted the city to foot all the costs,” Ballard said. “And in difficult budgetary times, that was not something the city could take on.”
Ballard said the owner of Midwest Display, a now-
Florida-based company that offers holiday decora-tions, approached the city this year about ending the thaw on Gainesville ice skating. Ballard said Midwest Display offered its services as a vendor, setting up at its own expense and paying the city a portion of the proceeds at the end.
The ice skating rink will be sponsored by Gainesville 
Regional Utilities, and electrical utility customers will receive coupon discounts at the rink, said GRU spokes-woman Kendall Litton Jensen.
When GRU customers receive their November and 
December electric bills, they will find coupons for $2 off per person in each household for up to five people, she said.
Taylor Nones, a 19-year-old UF telecommunica-
tion sophomore, said Gainesville’s ice rink will be an unexpected but welcome addition to winter activities available in the city.
“You don’t think of a small town in Florida as hav-
ing an ice rink,” she said. “I think it’s cool.”Ice rink to bring

University Police is investigating an incident at the P .K. 
Yonge Developmental Research School that led to police ar -
resting a student late last week.
Police charged the student, whose name was not released, 
Nov. 2 with false imprisonment and molesting a victim be-
tween the ages of 12 and 16, said UPD spokesman Brad Barber on Thursday.
Under Florida law, both charges are considered third-de-
gree felonies.
The arrest is connected to an incident that happened on 
Nov. 1, Barber said.
However, police did not release additional details about the 
investigation or the students involved because the case dealt with juveniles, Barber said.
“It is an ongoing investigation and future charges may be 
forthcoming,” Barber said.
P .K. Yonge, located in the 1100 block of Southwest 11th 
Street,  is a public school affiliated with UF’s College of Educa-tion.
Larry Lansford, spokesman for the College of Education, said since 1934, P .K. Yonge has been the “laboratory school” for the college.
Currently, 1,150 students from Kindergarten through 12th 
grade are enrolled in the school, according to the school’s web-site.
On the night of Nov. 2, Lynda Hayes, director of P .K. Yonge, 
sent out automated telephone calls to parents, notifying them about the incident and the increased presence of UPD officers at the school.
“We have taken appropriate steps regarding students in-
volved,” she said in the statement. “We are working with UPD in an effort to understand what happened.”
Hayes added that school officials would not be able to dis-
cuss the incident because of the students’ ages.  
On Thursday, UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes echoed 
Hayes, saying she could not provide additional information about the incident for the same reasons.

UF seniors Aidan Augustin and Neal 
Ormsbee found their direction in life.
They just had to stop going to class to 
do it.
The 21-year-old best friends, roommates 
of three years and now business partners 
are the co-founders of Feathr, a startup that has created a smartphone application designed to change the way people net-work professionally.
It all started with an idea: What if the 
concept of the business card could be revo-lutionized in the form of an app? One year after that initial idea was born, Feathr has become a completely student-run company complete with its own programming team, investors and office space.
“What people currently do is use paper 
business cards, but no one has the time with a stack of new contacts to put in all the info, for instance after a conference,” Augustin said. “Automating that process and making business cards digital so they can sync to all your devices facilitates the online, social-media culture we live in.”
The electronic “business card-like” in-
terface is designed for efficiency, allowing the user to store new contacts’ informa-tion all in one place. There are buttons for email, phone, Twitter, a website or online portfolio, and they’re accessible with one tap.
The seed for Feathr was planted when 
Augustin interned in Silicon Valley, Calif., during Summer 2011. He realized while at a networking event as he and other interns tried to clumsily swap information that there was no standardized way to elec-tronically give people his card. 
He remembers joking with one woman 
about how “we are some of the smartest people with supercomputers literally in our pockets, and we can’t figure this out.”The idea was still in the back of his mind 
when Augustin participated in a Start-Up Weekend in Tallahassee last fall, a compe-tition that challenges entrepreneurial col-lege-age students to create an entire con-cept and business model in two days.
By the end of the weekend the concept 
was called CardSync, which would even-tually become Feathr. 
His idea didn’t win one of the prizes, 
but it was selected to be among the top 10 that were judged at the end.
After trying to work on the company 
that semester while also taking classes, Augustin realized he couldn’t pursue his business model as a fully enrolled student. But everything seemed to be lining up in favor of the company. Ormsbee, a com-puter science major, came fully onboard to assist with the programming.
They decided over winter break of 2011 
that they would drop out of school the next semester and work on their company full time.
“We sort of had a ‘come to Jesus mo-
ment’,” Augustin said. “The thing was, I 
said to Neal, ‘You’re going to have to be-
come a software god.’”
Flash forward to Fall 2012, and the 
Feathr team has expanded to include pro-grammers Gabe Busto, Tasha Hankewych, Andrew Kennedy and designer Will New-ton.
“One of the neat things about startup 
life is that the teams are small, and every-one onboard is there because they love and believe in what they’re doing,” Ormsbee said.
The Feathr office is located in the brand-
new UF Innovation Hub that opened last January and is not much bigger than a study room at Library West. But it’s one of the most decorated and lived-in on their floor.
Computers, wires, smartphones and 
whiteboards covered in programming lan-guage are all over the office. 
The walls are plastered with inspira-
tional quotes like “Innovation is War,” which reminds them that disrupting the way things are isn’t always easy, and the “V for Vendetta” movie poster because “we view ourselves as revolutionaries,” Augustin said.
Though the office energy is inspiring, 
one of the downsides of nurturing a start-up is struggling for funds to keep it alive.
“They certainly aren’t doing it for mon-
ey or to build a reputation,” Ormsbee said. “We don’t have the funds to pay anyone what their talents are really worth.”
In just about a year, the Feathr team has 
become a family, and Augustin and Orms-bee have big plans for the future. The app was released to its first group of users last week.
Currently, a group of 1,200 people are 
beta testing the app for basic user-friendli-ness and to detect bugs. 
Augustin hopes to have the app avail-
able through the iTunes App Store by the end of January. 
A year from now, he predicts up to 1 mil-
lion people using Feathr on their phones.
And in five years?“By then I think we’ll have sold Feathr 
and be millionaires by 25,” Augustin said with a smile.12, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 9, 2012

Four months after UF President 
Bernie Machen announced he will 
step down from his post next year, nobody is sure who will replace him.
On-campus interviews will start 
soon, and updates from search committee chairman David Brown suggest the university is getting a lot of interest from leaders at other academic institutions.
Names like Florida Senate Presi-
dent Mike Haridopolos, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and UF Pro-vost Joe Glover have been floating around as candidates for the job, but as of now, anyone can be nomi-nated.
According to the presidential 
search committee’s list of desired criteria, UF’s next leader should have “an academic background and credentials, including a Ph.D. or highest degree in the chosen field,” who is “recognized as a na-tional and international scholar of distinction” and “has experience in an administrative leadership posi-tion at a major university.”
  One of the things often men-
tioned is that UF is looking for a leader at an institution belonging to the Association of American Universities.
Of the 61 AAU universities in 
the U.S., UF is the only one in Flor -
ida.
Whoever the university choos-
es, the new president is going to face challenges, particularly of the financial variety.
According to UF budget docu-
ments, the state has cut roughly $183 million from UF’s operating budget from 2008 to 2013.
UF Vice President and CFO Matt Fajack said the university’s funding for new buildings has been cut drastically.
While $183 million in lost state 
revenue sounds like a big number, it should be put in perspective.
UF has a yearly budget of $4.6 
billion, 10 percent of which are state dollars.
Even if the state government 
decides to pull its punches when it comes to university funding, there’s still the federal government to worry about, said Cheri Brodeur, Faculty Senate chairwoman and a member of UF’s Board of Trustees.
Brodeur said the federal govern-
ment is discussing cutting down on research funding. With that as a possibility, Brodeur said it’s going to be important for administration to do what it can to retain faculty and students.
“We want to avoid a brain 
drain,” she said.
Faculty, she said, can attract stu-
dents. If key faculty leave, students could leave as well.
“People think there’s still some 
fat out there,” she said. “Person-ally, I don’t see it.”
But Fajack and UF spokes-
woman Janine Sikes say the time for cutting is over, and the time for growth is now.
In fact, because Florida took cuts 
early on, Sikes said, Florida might be a better position for an incom-ing president because he or she wouldn’t have to make a series of unpopular cuts off the bat.
While the position carries an 
enormous amount of prestige, not everyone is chomping at the bit to lead the Gator Nation.
Twenty other institutions are 
searching for new presidents or chancellors, including Princeton University, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Louisiana State University and the University of Georgia.
Brown said 10 of the 20 are inter -
ested in candidates who are similar to those UF hopes to attract.
An additional hurdle is Sun-
shine Law, Brodeur said.
The Sunshine Law is a public 
records law in Florida that requires virtually all government business to be done in the public eye.
With UF being a state institution, almost everything is documented as a matter of public record, includ-ing the list of those who have ap-plied to the job.
However, some sitting presi-
dents at other research institutions won’t even consider the position because of this law.
The major deterrent isn’t nec-
essarily because they don’t want their on-campus business done in the open, Brodeur said. Instead, it’s more about the types of questions they might face from their own Board of Trustees and other inter -
ested parties back at home if they didn’t get the position.
“We’ve got a long way to go be-fore we know where we are,” she said.
Still, UF administration is confi-
dent the university has a lot to offer over other universities.
It is, according to the U.S. News 
and World Report, the top-ranked public school in the state.
Also, it is one of only 74 univer -
sities in the nation with land-grant status.
It boasts an athletic department 
that not only operates in the black but gives money back to the uni-versity’s academic fund.
“We’re still the University of 
Florida,” Brodeur said. “We’re not a lightweight.”FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 9, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 13

Before Tracy Morgan jokes in 
slang and Josh Turner sings in twang, 
UF’s Alumni Association will throw a cocktail party.
The association is inviting alumni 
to stop by for the first-ever Pre-Growl Member Party, which is scheduled for 5:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. today at Emerson Alumni Hall. The party is a new effort by the association to con-nect with UF alumni, said Karen Wil-liams, a special events coordinator for the Alumni Association.
“We’re trying to figure out better 
ways to reach our alumni,” she said. “So many people come back for Gator Growl and are in need of something to do while they’re in town.”
The event will offer soda and  
hors d’oeuvres. There will also be a full cash bar.
There is no admission charge for 
members of the alumni association, but there is a $10 fee for non-mem-bers. All are welcome, said Brynn Cavanaugh, an associate director of membership and philanthropy.
“We just want people who are in 
town to swing by,” Williams said.
Cavanaugh said the associa-
tion has received complaints about the lack of activities and facilities available to alumni who return to Gainesville.
“We’re just trying to open our 
doors and welcome our alumni back,” she said.

Sixty years ago, a Marine 
risked his life by throwing his 
body on a grenade. Today, he’s the Grand Marshal of UF’s Homecoming Parade.
Cpl. Duane Dewey, an 81-
year-old Medal of Honor re-cipient, will lead the parade in a Marine Jeep. Following him will be other veterans and two members of the Department of Defense’s 60th Anniversary of the Korean War Commemora-tion Committee.
Dewey plans to lead the pa-
rade, and Col. David J. Clark, director of the committee, will present him with his plaque and award at about 10:30 a.m. at Van Fleet Hall on campus.
Dewey received his Medal 
of Honor in 1953. He was near Panmunjom, Korea and serving as a machine gunner in Company E. He and his assistant gunner were hurt and receiving medical atten-tion when a grenade landed near him. Dewey yelled for other Marines to get out of the way, while he “smothered the deadly missile with his body, 
p e r s o n a l l y 
a b s o r b i n g the full force of the explo-sion to save his comrade from pos-sible injury or death,” according to 
his Medal of Honor citation.
Commander of the Ko-
rean War Veterans’ Associa-tion in Gainesville Dick Da-vis said he is a good friend of Dewey’s. He said Dewey told him when President Dwight D. Eisenhower awarded the Medal of Honor, Eisenhower whispered, “If that had been an American grenade, you wouldn’t have been here.”
Davis also said Dewey’s 
was the first Medal of Honor Eisenhower gave to anyone.
Clark said 13 Korean War 
Medal of Honor recipients are alive today. It is the nation’s highest award for military personnel who risked his or her own safety, Clark said.
Canedo said honoring 
these veterans is the nation’s way of righting a wrong be-cause the Korean War is often forgotten.
“From the government’s 
perspective, the 60th anni-versary is the last time to say thank you as a nation to all of them,” Clark said.

It’s hard to know why the banis-
ters are always sticky.
The wooden railings are covered 
with a noxious combination of sub-
stances from Gatorade to grain alco-hol, a small taste of the shenanigans that happen inside the Alpha Tau Omega Fraternity house — many of which would give any mother a migraine.
But the fraternity’s chief secret-
keeper isn’t a special room full of guarded mysteries – she’s a viva-cious 63-year-old West Virginian.
Donna Land is one of a handful 
of fraternity housemothers who live with upward of 50 sometimes-drunk college-aged men.
She has lived at the fraternity 
house for the past four years af-ter her two children moved out of Gainesville.
Land’s daughter, Summer, said 
she’s glad her mother is keeping busy and thought Land’s experience working at a nursery was the best preparation for the job.
“They never sleep, and you nev-
er know when someone is going to vomit,” Summer said.
But Land loves her boys too 
much to make a fuss.
“Sometimes it’s loud and some-
times it’s late, but I really enjoy it,” she said, smiling.
She’s the only parent in the house, 
something she’s familiar with after raising two children on her own. She credits her upbringing in the South-east with helping her learn to live on her own.
It’s hard not to notice some of 
Land’s Southern traits. Her soft, Ap-palachian voice floats into a conver -
sation like the smell of magnolia in spring. The quirks stem from Land’s upbringing in the small coal-mining town of Bluefield, W. Va.
She got her first brush with Greek 
life when she went to the Massey Business College in Atlanta, now named the Art Institute of Atlanta. She dated a Kappa Sigma up the road at Georgia Technical University and noticed an older woman around the house.
“I’d see this old woman walking 
around,” she said. “I’d ask, ‘Why is she here?’”
She laughed. “And now it’s full 
circle.”
Land also found love in college 
and married Steve Land. The two moved back to Bluefield, W. Va., and Donna gave birth to her son soon after. She was beginning to form a family. Everything was per -
fect, until one summer day.
Steve went to South Carolina 
without Land, and he decided to go for an early morning swim. He was carried out to sea by a powerful rip current.
Donna never saw her husband 
again but had her hands full with one young child and another on the way . There was almost no time to grieve — between raising two new-borns into adults, she carried the weight of two parents.“My husband died in June, my 
son turned 2 in July and my daugh-ter was born in August,” Land said. “It was just shocking.”
But when her children graduated 
from high school and went out of state for college, Land began to feel a void in her life.
It was time for a change — which 
drifted Land’s way after she learned that an acquaintance got a job as Chi Phi’s house mom at UF.
Land jumped at the next chance 
to apply for a housemother opening. The job seems like Land’s second wind. She beams a calm serenity , twanged with an infectious love of fun.
Land’s main responsibilities are 
ordering food, preparing for fire inspections, hosting the Game Day barbecues, putting up decorations for the annual Christmas dinner and sending invitations out for Found-er’s Day weekend.“She loves putting on these big 
things and meeting all the families,” Land’s daughter said.
Her apartment doesn’t have any 
trouble with the creaky doors and rickety floors that seem to dominate the interior of the house. 
She has a living room about the 
size of three parking spaces with a small, attached kitchen and pan-try. A hallway leads to a bathroom, which leads into her bedroom. Light streams through six windows that face the courtyard of the fraternity.
Some of her favorite memories 
with the fraternity happened on that patch of weedy pavement. One of her favorite fraternity parties is Al-pha Tau Omega’s V olcano, which happens once every Fall. The men build a 30- to 40-foot tall volcano in the courtyard, complete with a built-in bar.
“I love the energy, I love the exu-
berance, and I love the creativity that goes into building the volcano,” Land said. “It’s such a bonding thing, they really have a good time out there. It’s so cool.”
She has an appreciation for row-
diness and debauchery rarely seen in a woman her age, but she refuses to tell some of her favorite stories about the fraternity.
“Well the best one’s I wouldn’t 
tell — I used to say that they pay me for my silence,” Land joked.
She rarely ventures upstairs to 
where the men live — half out of re-spect for their space and half out of fear of what she’ll find.
She also enjoys the more quiet 
times she shares with the broth-ers, like eating dinner with the new brothers. Land feels a special con-nection with the men she’s tasked with watching over. She said she would never dare to breathe a bad word about any of her boys.
“Oh no, I’ve got my boys’ back 
all the time,” she said. “We support each other.”
Outside of the brotherhood, Land 
has found a sisterhood of her own. Every week, the fraternity house-mothers and the sorority house-mothers will get together on differ -
ent days to get dinner or go out on the town.
They commiserate, laugh, tell 
stories about their kids and get a much-needed break from 20-year-olds. Though her son and daughter live across the globe, Land said she feels like loved ones always sur -
round her.
Summer Land said she’s grateful 
that her mother had the chance to start fresh.
“It’s a really good thing for her,” 
she said. “With my brother in San Francisco and me in Australia, this is the perfect thing to keep her occu-pied all day.”
The brothers at Alpha Tau Ome-
ga house have a tradition that also makes Land feel more like part of a family.
“They all call me mom,” she said. 
“It’s especially fun for me because my real children call me Donna.”

Donna Land, 63, is housemother for the Alpha Tau Omega Fraternity. After her two children moved

Fueled by coffee, Tara Cohen negotiated 
with garage sale shoppers rummaging for a 
bargain on a foggy Saturday morning. Instead of doing an unseasonal spring cleaning, she was preparing to uproot her family in search of a better life for her son.
Scattered across the sale were worn mat-
tresses leaning against landscaped trees, clothes dangling from the garage ceiling by plastic hangers and children’s toys in Hug-gies cardboard boxes. None of them will go with Cohen, 37, and her grade-school children when they move to California this December to get better health care for Cohen’s disabled 7-year-old son Will.
Will was diagnosed with severe autism, 
Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder and other challenges at 22 months old. He is considered preverbal, meaning he can make sounds, but he can’t speak.
With proper treatment, Cohen said, he 
might be able to talk someday , but cutbacks in state funding have kept Will from getting the expensive therapy he needs.
“He had 10 words and lost all of them,” 
she said, holding back tears. “He never said mommy.”
Will starts his day like any other 7-and-a-
half-year-old: breakfast and a rerun of “Mad-agascar 3” at an early start of 6 a.m.
Rather than a sugary bowl of cereal, Will 
eats a blend of fruit-based Gerber baby food, gluten-free Rice Krispies, rice powder, and a mix of vitamin supplements and medicine. The meal isn’t cheap — it costs Cohen about $700 a month.
A good day for Will means a few screams, 
but no tantrums. On one occasion, when he calmed down, there was  a dent the size of a soccer ball in the wall.
Clutching his favorite toys, a worn, green 
strand of yarn wrapped in masking tape and a CD, Cohen drops him off at a special needs classroom for the day.
After school, Will hops on the bus with Ni-
cole Reed, a 21-year-old UF family, youth and community sciences senior and Will’s per -
sonal counselor at the North Central Florida YMCA.
In a room bound by red, green, yellow and blue walls with a soft, puzzle-piece floor, Reed is a constant face in Will’s day-to-day life.
“I spend more time with him than anyone 
else in my life,” she said. “The day they leave, it’s gonna be pretty sad.”
Most days, Will fills his day by playing on 
the swing set, swimming and yelling in small spaces to hear an echo. Sometimes, he’ll lash out at Reed, particularly if he’s upset that something has disrupted his rigid routine.
Reed said she’s noticed that Will’s behav-ior has changed lately , but she’s unsure if it’s because Will sometimes doesn’t have his iPod touch, which helps him tune out, or if it’s be-
cause he has access to less therapy now.
“I can see it in his eyes that it’s never mali-
cious,” she said.
She calms him down and tickles him be-
hind his knees, his most sensitive spot. A grin 
with missing front teeth lights across his face.
Last year, Gov. Rick Scott ordered imme-
diate budget cuts to the state’s Agency for Persons with Disabilities, according to the Orlando Sentinel. Cohen said that although her child should be receiving 20 to 30 hours 
of therapy a week, he only gets two hours of 
therapy at school: one for speech therapy and one with an occupational therapist.
She made the decision to move to Califor -
nia this summer when those two hours were cut, too.
“Any politician who balances his budget 
on the backs of kids with disabilities is a dis-grace to our nation,” Cohen said.
Cohen, who doesn’t qualify for Medicaid, 
said her Blue Cross Blue Shield insurance only covers 20 sessions a year. In California, Cohen said there are state-, county- and school-spon-sored services.
“In Gainesville, I had to fight tooth and 
nail for two hours of therapy,” she said. “In California, I will fight for 25 to 20.”
The Cohens began working with Cathy 
Zenko, coordinator for education and train-ing programs at UF’s Center for Autism and Related Disabilities, shortly after Will’s diag-nosis five years ago.
Zenko said the center, which serves 2,500 
constituents in 14 Florida counties, has been suffering from state budget cuts since 2006. Fundraisers like the annual Stomp the Swamp were organized to subsidize lost funding.
Zenko said she’s seen families get into a 
lot of debt from borrowing money to get their childern therapy. Some stop completely.
Cohen has lived in Gainesville since 1999. 
Raised in California, she’s moving to the Los Angeles area where she has family and busi-ness connections.
“For me, it’ s going home,” she said.Cohen, a full-time freelance marketing 
writer, took out a second mortgage on her southwest Gainesville home to pay for her son’s needs. She said her credit is destroyed and her house is in foreclosure. She also filed for divorce last month.
“When your kid needs something, you 
spend everything you have,” Cohen said. “I would make that choice 1,000 times over.”
Cohen said she would host another garage 
sale next month. A friend has also set up a donation website, www.giveforward.com/helpingtara, for her move.
“I’ve never in my life been good at ac-
cepting help, much less asking for it,” Cohen said.
Moving expenses will cost her $5,000, but 
she is setting a combined goal of $30,000 for rent because she cannot work until months after the move — she must acclimate her son to his new life, new doctors and therapy ses-sions.
“We spent every last dime helping our 
son,” she said. FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 9, 2012 § ALLIGATOR, 17 16, ALLIGATOR §  FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 9, 2012

Will Cohen sits alone on the family couch Wednesday evening while “Madagascar 3” plays on TV. Will used to watch his movies on iPod 
touches. After he broke four in one month, his mother took them away because she could no longer afford to keep buying them. “We pick our battles,” Tara Cohen said about disciplining Will. 
ABOVE:  Will Cohen has a fixation with his peripheral vision and often 
watches things through a reflection. Here, Will uses a blank DVD to 
watch “Madagascar 3” before school Thursday morning while playing with his ever-present green yarn.
BELOW:  Marty Cohen, 52, wraps masking tape around his son Will’s

PERMISSION TO HAVE A PET.
SUJIE WU
Alligator Contributing Writer
When students move away from home 
to attend college for the first time, it can be 
nice to have a little company.
“If you’ve had a pet your whole life, like 
you’ve had a dog or a cat at home, and you can’t have those here, it’s always good to have something,” said Alejandra Ramirez, 20, a Murphree Area resident assistant and a math and statistics junior. 
The list of pets allowed in UF dorms in-
cludes gerbils, lizards, frogs, salamanders and geckos, according to UF’s Housing and Residence Education pet policy agreement. Fish, hamsters, birds and chinchillas are most popular, said Ayesha Rizvi Mian, the residence life coordinator for the Broward Yulee Area.
“We don’t allow guinea pigs anymore, 
because they can get really big, and the smell they generate was a big concern for people,” she said.
According to the pet policy agreement 
form, residents must obtain prior written approval from all roommates and their res-ident life coordinator, residence director, graduate hall director or resident manager before bringing the pet into their rooms.
Only two pets from the approved pet list are allowed per resident. Fish are the only exception. All pets are also required to re-main inside the rooms or apartments at all times, according to housing and residence education’s community standard.
“The worry we have over those things 
is that they could get out of the cage, and what if they get into somebody’s stuff?” Mian said. “Sometimes they’ve gotten into the AC vent, and then we couldn’t find them.”
Becky Giallella, a 21-year-old occupa-
tional therapy senior, said she used to have a mouse in her dorm. She said she didn’t feel it was fair to the mouse to live in that environment, and it was too much to take care of.
“I don’t even think it’s fair to the animal 
to be in a small cage,” Mian said. “They don’t get the place to be active.”
But having the company of pets can often 
be beneficial to students’ mental health.
“Having something that you can hold or 
play with, and having something that de-pends on you just makes you feel good,” said Jennifer Becker, a 19-year-old explor -
atory sophomore who keeps a dwarf rabbit in her dorm.
Mian said students in her area are very 
responsible with their pets.
“We are very lucky. Our students really 
take care of their animals,” she said. “They take their responsibility seriously, and I think that’s why this policy has become so successful.”18, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 9, 2012

Football player Chad “Ochocin-
co” Johnson Skyped with more than 
100 students in UF’s Sports Media & Society class Thursday morning.
Professor Ted Spiker lectured 
about the role Twitter plays in the sports world and kicked off Op-eration Ochocinco. Students took to their personal Twitter accounts to catch the attention of Johnson, who has more than 3.7 million followers and 40,000 tweets.
“I’ve had this thought before 
that we ought to put our Twitter power in one concerted effort,” Spiker said.
At about 11 a.m., Johnson re-
sponded. Girls shrieked, guys gasped and Spiker’s face lit up.
“Everybody in the class got pret-ty excited,” said 
Nick Swain, a 20-year-old tele-communication junior.
After sorting 
through techni-cal difficulties, the athlete video-
chatted with the class about his love for Twitter, opinions about foot-ball and his trip to Gainesville last weekend.
“I thought he came across as 
a real person,” Swain said. “He showed us his own personality, which I thought was the coolest part.”
Morgan Moriarty, a 20-year-old 
telecommunication sophomore, said she was in shock that the ath-lete agreed to speak with the class.“He was so open and honest 
with every question we asked, which was great,” she said. “You could tell he was being himself.”
Spiker said the session was per -
fect.
“He cracked jokes, but was 
dead-on serious at other times,” he said. “I don’t think I should do any more lectures this semester because that won’t be topped.”

Al Martin, 69, is a librarian at Alachua County Tower Road Branch 
Library. Martin was one of the eight people chosen to receive a Carol Combs Hole Award for his work with non-native English speakers.

When Al Martin traveled to 
Mexico, he returned home to 
Gainesville with an award-win-ning idea.
The 69-year-old librarian pio-
neered a program to help local immigrants learn English and as-similate into Gainesville’s com-munity. He has hosted programs at the Alachua County Tower Road Branch Library for about two years.
Martin was among the eight 
people chosen by the library dis-trict for this year’s Carol Combs Hole Award for his work with di-versity programs.
“I just came back from Mexico 
with my teeth fixed and an idea under my hat,” said the librarian of 18 years. “The program won the award. I didn’t.”
Phillis Filer, chairwoman of 
the selection committee, said Mar -
tin’s program was award-worthy because his idea went beyond his day-to-day job.
“It was how he went about 
bringing that program together to address a need in the commu-nity,” she said.
Filer said Martin was chosen 
because of his passion to help the community.
“He really, really relishes see-
ing people go from barely speak-ing English to speaking it flu-ently,” she said. “It’s important to recognize the fact that we have a staff member who constantly looks at ways to enhance the com-munity.”
Martin said he went to Mexico 
two years ago for dental surgery. During his visit, Martin volun-teered at the library to talk and work with people who lived there.
“It was an interesting cultural 
experience,” he said.
After returning home, he cre-
ated the program to teach immi-grants English and to help them with interviewing techniques, writing resumes and more.
Martin said his program has 
aided people from software en-gineers to doctors to academic scholars.
“These people are visiting 
scholars,” he said. “They are try-ing to transition into this culture and into this language.”  The blue-eyed and white-haired 
librarian said he cannot take all of the credit for the award.
“There are a hell of a lot of peo-
ple who contributed,” he said. “I feel like I’m just the mouthpiece for this thing.”
Sidney Jones, a co-worker of 
Martin for 18 years, said Martin’s interest in learning foreign lan-guages has allowed the program to excel.
“He’s put in a tremendous 
amount of work for several years, and it has been an extremely suc-cessful program,” Jones said. “He’s gotten a lot of very grateful participants who inspired him to expand the program.”
Jones said Martin likes to read 
and absorb strange things that happen in the world.
“He is very intelligent and has 
a wonderful memory that I wish I had,” he said. “He likes to keep us stocked with ice cream, too.”
For Martin, he said his joy 
comes from meeting interesting people.
“It gives you an opportunity 
to meet a lot of really cool people and people from other cultures,” Martin said.

Leading the pack at 48-32 is Rivals’ Bryan “I <3 Josh El-

In second with a 44-36 mark is alligatorSports editor Greg

Tied with Luca for silver is The Miami Herald’s Matt “J-A-

Rounding out the second-place tie is The Associated Press’ 
Mark “Muschamp family beat reporter” Long, who recently spouted off the results of Will Muschamp’s sons’ football games like it was common knowledge. Uh, creepy.
Next up with a 41-39 clip is The Palm Beach Post’s Jason

extended minutes off the bench. 
In UF’s exhibition rout of Nebraksa-Kearney on 
Nov. 1, Frazier flourished, scoring a team-high 21 points on 8-for-10 shooting. 
Ogbueze scored 15 points, Graham recorded 12 
points and three assists, and Walker tallied two points on 1-for-5 shooting. 
With Yeguete, power forward Erik Murphy 
and center Patric Young starting, Florida matches up well against Georgetown’s height. Four of the Hoyas’ five starters are at least 6 feet 8 inches. 
Sophomore forward Otto Porter, who averaged 
9.7 points and a team-best 6.8 rebounds per game last season, is Georgetown’s most dynamic talent. 
“We’re going to do the best we can to prepare 
for a guy like that and take him out of his comfort zone,” Young said. 
The Gators are tasked with trying to shut down 
Porter and the Hoyas without Wilbekin, one of their best defenders.
“He’s very, very remorseful,” Donovan said. 
“(He) feels very, very bad. ... Scottie will learn from this, grow from this and be better from it.”24, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 9, 2012

Dan Quinn did the same thing for 10 years. 
He spent nearly a quarter of his life coach-
ing NFL defensive linemen.
After coaching three teams in eight seasons, 
Quinn landed in Seattle.
He was comfortable in the Emerald City . Then, an old friend came calling.When UF coach Will Muschamp needed a 
defensive coordinator in January 2011, he im-mediately thought of Quinn. The duo had pre-viously worked together with the Miami Dol-phins for one season, but Quinn wasn’t so sure he wanted to make the jump. 
“There was (hesitation) on my end, because 
you have done one thing for 10 years, you’re kind of settled, and I certainly enjoyed where I was at,” Quinn said. “I had a good time work-ing with Pete Carroll and John Schneider, the GM, there. There was hesitancy not from com-ing back to college and coming here or working for Will, but I enjoyed what I was doing there, and I was happy. But, I thought the opportu-nity was too unique to pass up, and that’s why I wanted to come. And I’m glad that I did.”
Florida is better because of it. The Gators defense finished in the nation’s 
top 10 for three straight seasons before Quinn arrived in Gainesville, but this is a different team.
A more experienced unit that has decreased 
its total yards allowed per game each season since 2010.
The secret to Quinn’s success on the field 
may be what happens off it.
Senior safety Josh Evans described Quinn as Kenny Boynton is not afraid of waves — or sea monsters, appar -
ently. Florida is playing George-
town on a boat tonight, and Boynton hasn’t even taken the buoyant surface of the Atlantic Ocean into account?
A reporter asked him if the waves 
would be a factor, and this guy said: “I didn’t even think about that. I guess we’re going to see how that plays out.”
We’re going to see how that plays 
out? Why don’t you just dive into the water with the main score from Jaws playing? Let’s see how that plays out!
There are countless aquatic threats 
UF did not even consider before agree-ing to play on the water! We’re talk-ing overzealous lobsters, crotchety old sea turtles and non-Pixar sharks! Even Godzilla came out of the ocean once!
Perhaps the shrimp community is 
fed up with the excess of humanity’s cocktail parties. If every shrimp in the Jacksonville area grabs 10 friends, things could get dicey.
The ocean is perilous, and we here at 
the alligatorSports Brand Picks Column do not take unknown waters lightly!
Good luck, Mr. Boynton. May Po-
seidon — and oppressed shrimp every-where — have mercy on your soul!
Now, onto the picks!
Georgia (-15.5) will sink Auburn’s

The Dawgs actually have something

Florida will be without starting 
point guard Scottie Wilbekin in its 
season opener against Georgetown tonight. The team suspended the junior indefinitely on Thursday for undisclosed reasons.  
After “finding out some infor -
mation on some things,” coach Billy Donovan informed Wilbekin of his suspension minutes before the team departed to the USS Bataan in Jacksonville at 8:30 a.m. on Thursday. 
Wilbekin did not travel with 
the team to Naval Station May-port. Wilbekin did not earn the suspension because of a criminal act or NCAA violation, Donovan said. 
“Right now, I felt like he didn’t 
need to be here on this trip,” Don-ovan said. “None of us are im-mune from making mistakes and making poor choices and doing things. Sometimes, a decision a person makes doesn’t necessarily say who the person is all the way around. Scottie is a good person with a good heart who’s got to be responsible and accountable and committed. He’s got to grow and mature.”
Wilbekin was expected to be-
gin the season as No. 10 Florida’s starting point guard, taking  the reins from UF all-time assists lead-er Erving Walker. The 6-foot-2 Wilbekin aver -
aged 2.5 points and 1.6 assists per contest as Florida’s backup point guard the past two seasons. 
The loss of 
Wilbekin leaves 
the Gators with only nine schol-arship players — five returners and four fresh-men — heading into tonight’s season-opening 
matchup at 9 p.m. against George-town. 
Florida will also be without ju-
nior forward Casey Prather. Dur -
ing Monday’s practice, Prather suffered his second concussion in a span of nine days. 
Sophomore forward Cody Lar -
son quit the team on Oct. 26, leav-ing the Gators thin in the front-court. 
Senior shooting guard Kenny 
Boynton will run the point against the Hoyas. Boynton has played point guard sparingly during the past three seasons. 
Redshirt senior guard Mike 
Rosario and freshman point guard Braxton Ogbueze are expected to  back up Boynton. 
Junior Will Yeguete will likely 
start at small forward, while Rosa-rio or freshman Michael Frazier II will start at shooting guard, Dono-van said.

When the Gators and Hoyas 
take the court on the deck of the 
USS Bataan tonight, chills will run down their spines for reasons other than patriotism.
The conditions on the deck of 
the amphibious  assault ship will 
present some obstacles for No. 10 Florida and Georgetown when the teams square off at 9 p.m. in the Navy-Marine Corps Classic at Naval Station Mayport in Jackson-ville.
Tonight’s forecast calls for 
temperatures in the mid-50s with winds of 4 miles per hour, accord-ing to Weather.com. 
“The players always use the 
phrase ‘get cold on the bench’ when they’re sitting out, but I’ll literally be cold on the bench if I’m sitting out,” said junior Patric Young, a Jacksonville native. “The last time I played basketball outside had to be in middle school. It’s going to bring back some old-school memories.”
The windy weather could af-
fect the game plan for the Gators, whose strength lies in three-point shooting. Shot selection, gathering loose balls and rebounding will all be key, coach Billy Donovan said.“Even in a regular situation, if 
we were running down and taking quick threes, I wouldn’t be happy,” Donovan said. 
“We can’t totally alter every-
thing we’re doing because we’re outside.”
Senior Kenny Boynton believes 
the wind will be a major factor.
“If the shots aren’t falling, I 
think we’ve got to get to the hole,” Boynton said. 
“The numbers from the Michi-
gan State-North Carolina game, I don’t think any team shot well. We have to get fouled, get to the hole more.”
When North Carolina and 
Michigan State played on the flight deck of the USS Carl Vinson in the Carrier Classic on Nov. 11, 2011, in San Diego, they shot a combined 6 for 32 beyond the arc. 
Donovan sought advice from 
Spartans coach Tom Izzo  about how to deal with playing outside. 
Michigan State’s situation was 
different, because warmer tem-peratures in San Diego resulted in condensation on the court during the 7 p.m. contest.  
Florida and Georgetown each 
had shootarounds on the deck of the ship Thursday to get a feel for the conditions. 
“The court seemed fine,” 
Georgetown coach John Thompson III said. 
“Because of the issues that 
happened last year, the people in-volved in putting on the game are thinking about it. The key is safety. … I’m telling my guys it’s not go-ing to affect them at all. That’s how we’re approaching it.”
Navy-Marine Corps Classic or -
ganizers have discussed placing heaters behind both benches, Don-ovan said. 
Also, the NCAA has approved 
long-sleeve shirts for both teams to wear in the game.
Despite all the chatter about the 
weather and patriotic implications for tonight’s season opener, Florida and Georgetown have tuned out the distractions. 
“No matter how hyped up the 
game is, you still have to go out there and play,” Young said. “You can’t be caught up in the moment. You just have to realize it’s another game when we step on the court.”

  After spending time at the 
coach’s house, linebacker Jelani 
Jenkins said Quinn is funnier than most people realize.
    “He’s a great person and a 
guy that, he and (his wife) Sta-cy , they’re wonderful people,” Muschamp said. “He’s about all the right things in college athletics.”
  The two coaches didn’t need 
long to adjust after they started working at Florida. 
  Together in Miami, the duo 
helped the Dolphins reel off six straight victories to ﬁ  nish 9-7 in 2005.
“He’s high energy and a lot 
of fun to play for,” former Mi-ami defensive end Jason Taylor said of Quinn. “I can guarantee no one is more prepared than Dan. He’s certainly one of the best position coaches I ever played for, and I’m not sur-prised at all by the success he’s having at Florida.”
  Quinn called Muschamp one 
of the best defensive coaches he’s been around at any level.   “We all had colleagues ... you 
just feel like it’s easy to talk to or get connected with,” Quinn said. “That’s certainly how it is with Will.”
  Quinn’s play calling has the 
Gators ranked No. 5 nation-ally in total defense and tied for sixth in interceptions.
  On the ﬁ  rst play from scrim-
mage against South Carolina on Oct. 20, Quinn dialed up a cor-nerback blitz. 
Loucheiz Purifoy came off 
the edge and forced South Car-olina quarterback Connor Shaw to fumble. 
Florida generated four turn-
overs in a 33-point blowout in The Swamp.
  The Gators love playing 
for Quinn because his defense readies them for the NFL.
  “It’s really going to prepare 
not just me, but everybody who has aspirations at the next lev-el,” Jenkins said. “We rally be-hind him. We play for him.”
  There’s no looking back 
for the former NFL assistant. He’s found a new home in Gainesville.

Amanda Butler has won more games 
through her first five seasons than any coach 
in program history.
Yet as Florida prepares for its season 
opener against Fairfield today at 4 p.m. in the O’Connell Center, she is hoping her program can reach new heights.
Butler returned to her alma mater for the 
2007-08 season and has since amassed 98 vic-tories, surpassing Carol Ross’ previous record of 97 wins through her first five seasons. 
The year before Butler took over, the 
Gators finished 9-22 — including a streak of 13 consecutive losses — and finished 11th in the Southeastern Conference. 
Athletics director Jeremy Foley looked for 
a young, talented coach to rebuild the pro-gram. He chose Butler. 
“I knew that we had a lot of work to do,” 
Butler said. “I still feel like we have a lot of work to do.”
Since being hired, Butler has led the Gators 
to a postseason appearance in each of her five seasons, becoming the program’s first coach to do so. 
“She bleeds orange and blue,” freshman 
Sydney Moss said. “She knows what it takes to be a winner and what it takes to be a Flor -
ida Gator.”
Despite the win total, the Gators have 
failed to challenge for a conference title un-der Butler.
During her five-year stretch as coach, UF’s 
best finish in the SEC was a fourth-place tie in 2008-09. In her four other seasons, the team hasn’t finished better than tied for seventh in the conference. 
Just two of her five postseason appear -
ances have been NCAA Tournament berths, and each resulted in Florida being eliminated in the second round.  
Though proud of what she has accom-
plished, she isn’t satisfied with simply win-ning games.
“We are here to win championships,” she 
said. “That’s why all of these young ladies came here — to resurrect a program that is a perennial NCAA Tournament team and a perennial contender in the toughest league in the country.”
Newcomers have had to quickly acclimate 
to Butler’s style of coaching. 
A four-year mainstay at the point guard 
position for the Gators, Butler helped lead Florida to its first two NCAA appearances in 1993 and 1994. 
She started 99 of 114 career games and 
once played 20 minutes against Florida State just hours after receiving 10 numbing shots to reset a severely broken nose. 
The same passion that motivated her as a 
player now drives her as a coach.
“She’s intense all the time,” junior transfer 
Vicky McIntyre said. “She knows what it is like to play in the SEC, so it really helps to have a coach who understands what you are going through.”
With a victory on Friday, Butler would 
have a chance to record win No. 100 as Flor -
ida’s coach when UF faces Georgia State on Sunday at 1 p.m. in the O’Connell Center. 
But Butler refuses to let herself, or her 
team, look ahead. 
“We’re just going to stay focused on trying 
to get better every day, learn the things we need to learn and win one game at a time,” she said.FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 9, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 29

The Gators’ painful pattern of 
players’ plights will continue when 
they visit Missouri tonight at 7:30 p.m. 
A week before the season be-
gan, Florida lost sophomore Noami Santos-Lamb, the Gators’ only ex-perienced outside hitter, to an ACL tear. Freshman outside hitter Jackie Swalchick has been limited to three appearances this year by a fractured left arm. Betsy Smith’s right ankle is still healing two weeks after she in-jured it. 
Now, Gabby Mallette has hit 
the bench with an undisclosed in-jury . Mallette has not appeared in a match since Florida’s 3-0 win against 
Mississippi State on Oct. 26. 
W i s e 
has consistently been forced to  tweak her lineup after losing a key player to injury every few  weeks. 
“It’s sort of been the theme of the 
2012 season,” Wise said. “Just when you think you got the lineup solidi-fied — it’s that time of the year.”
Wise said rather than expecting 
one individual to do the work, she has asked her healthy players to carry the burden as a team. 
“What every team has to fig-
ure out is, ‘What is the depth on your bench?’” Wise said. “When we thought at one point we would have neither Betsy nor Gabby . . . we asked, ‘Could [the healthy players] combine for 5.5 points to get us to just hold serve while those guys are out?’” 
Freshman Berkley Whaley start-
ed for the first time in two months when Mallette missed Florida’s match against Georgia.
In the past two matches, the 
Gators have witnessed the dou-ble-edged sword that is Whaley . Against the Bulldogs, she registered a .455 hitting percentage en route to another Southeastern Conference sweep. But on Sunday , Whaley hit a team-low -.222 and committed a season-high seven errors.
The 6-foot outside hitter said she can feel the extra weight on her shoulders, but added she can’t give in to the pressure.
“Pressure is always going to be 
there, but that’s part of the game,” she said. “You have to rise to the oc-casion, and you have to step up.”30, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 9, 2012

At the 2012 USTA/ITA 
National Indoor Intercolle-
giate Championships in New York, Florida’s women flour -
ished. Senior Lauren Em-bree, junior Sofie Oyen and freshman Danielle Collins all flew in to the big city with high expectations, and they all responded well Thursday afternoon.
Each member of the trio 
won in straight sets, advanc-ing to the round of 16 with ease.
Embree, Florida’s All-
America senior, kept her winning streak alive, moving to 6-0 for the fall. 
No. 1-seeded Embree 
posted a 6-3, 7-5 victory against Ole Miss’ Caroline Rohde-Moe. Embree im-proved her career record in singles to 97-13. 
After reaching the draw 
as an at-large bid, Oyen de-feated Columbia’s Nicole Bartnik 6-3, 6-4. 
Collins, a freshman, con-
tinued her superb play in the fall, beating Princeton’s Amanda Muliawan 6-3, 6-3.  She improved her collegiate singles record to 12-2.
The display impressed 
Florida coach Roland Thorn-qvist, who has seen his fair share of players succeed in this tournament.
“We were more aggres-
sive today than on any other first day at the national in-doors than I can remember,” Thornqvist  said. 
But Florida’s coach un-
derstands the competition is still steep. 
Embree is up against 
fifth-ranked Zsofie Susanyi of Cal, Oyen is up against Stanford’s Krista Hardebeck —  the NCAA’s top-ranked freshman — and Collins will face Tennessee’s 18th-ranked Brynn Boren.
“Competition is going 
to be even tougher tomor -
row and we must continue to play aggressive tennis,” Thornqvist said.
Florent Diep represented 
the Gators men’s team on Thursday afternoon but did not come out victorious. Diep lost 6-2, 6-4 to Baylor’s Julian Lenz.
Diep held a 3-2 lead in the 
second set before losing four of the final five games.UF women’s tennis

To coach Becky Burleigh, she’s a 
“beast” and a “monster.” 
However, in her own mind, she’s 
just Karina.
Since sophomore Annie Bobbitt  
was sidelined by a knee sprain suf-
fered on Oct. 19 against Alabama, fellow sophomore Karina Gutsche has filled in at center back for the Gators. 
In the five games since she as-
sumed the starting role, Florida has allowed only one goal.
“We’ve always known … that 
she was just such a solid defender,” Burleigh said. 
“She’s just so aggressive, and she 
comes in hard. People don’t like to play against her.”
The No. 2-seeded Gators (17-4-
1, 11-2 Southeastern Conference) could not have added Gutsche’s te-nacity at a better time. 
Florida faces Florida Gulf Coast 
(14-3-3, 7-1-1 Atlantic Sun Confer -
ence) in the first round of the NCAA Tournament today at 3 p.m. in James G. Pressly Stadium.
Gutsche didn’t play much for 
Florida in 2011. 
She only saw 45 minutes of ac-
tion, all in Florida’s 5-0 regular-sea-son victory against FGCU. 
Florida used 30 players in the 
blowout. “It means a lot to me,” Gutsche 
said about getting crucial playing time this season. “It’s a great oppor -
tunity.”
Gutsche has made the most of 
her opportunity and has been on the field for all but 19 minutes of Flori-da’s past five games.
“My motto when I go onto the 
field is: Don’t leave anything be-hind,” she said. 
Freshman center back Christen 
Westphal, who was named to the All-SEC second team and the SEC All-Freshman team on Oct. 29, has been paired with Gutsche on the back line for the past five games. Despite Gutsche’s limited experi-ence in a starting role, her play has impressed Westphal. 
“Karina gets a little nervous,” 
Westphal said. 
“All we have to do is keep her 
calm, and she plays really well, as you can see. Couldn’t even tell it was a different player back there, from Kat (Williamson) to Bobbitt to anyone.”
Nervousness was not a problem 
for the Gators’ defense during the SEC Tournament. 
After allowing an 81st-minute 
goal against Ole Miss, Florida closed out the tournament with back-to-back shutouts. 
However, going into the NCAA 
Tournament, the Gators will be missing one of their key defensive players — defensive midfielder Jo Dragotta. 
Dragotta, who was one of three 
Florida players named to the All-SEC first team, will miss UF’s match against FGCU because of a concus-sion suffered when an Auburn mid-fielder elbowed her on Sunday.
SEC Defensive Player of the Year 
Holly King has been Dragotta’s partner as the ‘2’ in Florida’s 4-2-3-1 formation this year. 
King admitted that Dragotta is 
a major component of Florida’s de-fense but added that the team should perform well despite her absence.  
Gutsche will likely play a large 
role in keeping Florida’s defense on track.
King didn’t hold back in her 
praise for Gutsche and said she ex-pects her to keep playing at a high level. 
“I have to be honest, I would be 
scared going up against her,” King said. 
“She’s just such a beast, and she’s 
so aggressive, that I have full confi-dence every time that she goes onto the field.”Sophomore stepping up on defense for UF
