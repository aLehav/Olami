Barbecue sizzled, DJs spun and 
young women screamed in uncon-
trollable glee as about 1,000 people 
crowded both sides of Southwest Eighth Street on Tuesday afternoon to witness a tradition: sorority Bid Day.
The newest sisters received their 
bid cards at the Reitz Union, which told them which house they’d been welcomed into. 
They then came rushing in little 
groups toward the houses, passing through Norman Tunnel, around Norman field and down Southwest Eighth Street.
The crowd was divided. The sorority sisters stood 
clumped in colorful groups in front of their respective houses on the 
east side of the street.
Meanwhile, hundreds of men 
stood watching across the way 
to cheer on the running sorority hopefuls and boo those who only walked.
Each group of girls was decked 
out in their own house colors and silly hats. The Delta Gamma girls wore 
sailor caps, and the Alpha Epsilon Phi ho wore similar green and white 
ones.
Though the sisters themselves 
declined to comment on the excite-
ment of the day, the bystanders 
were more than happy to share their 
sentiments.
“This is the most hot girls you’re 
ever going to see in one place, at 
one time,” said UF freshman Luke 
Epstein, who watched Tuesday’s event.
In the great fervor of running, 
hugging, kissing, picture taking and 
checking of make-up via reflections 
in car mirrors, there was plenty to gawk at.
Jennifer Marty, a senior adver -
tising major, turned out to observe the madness with some of her girl-friends. 
“It’s like running with the bulls,” 
she said, “in sundresses.”.
Sex video identifies suspects in Washington break-in
ELMA, Wash. — It wasn’t tough to 
identify the suspects in a break-in at a 
rural home at Washington state. The bare facts were right there.
The Grays Harbor County sheriff’s of-
fice says a neighbor who came to collect the mail while the owner was away sur -
prised a man and woman having sex on the floor Monday.
Chief Deputy Dave Pimentel says 
the naked couple fled, leaving behind the camera, which had been stolen else-where.
Pimentel said Tuesday that deputies 
who checked the video recognized the couple from previous contacts.
The 39-year-old woman was arrested 
for investigation of burglary. An arrest warrant was issued for the 31-year-old man.

� HIS ESTATE GRANTS THE 
MUSEUM A $1 MILLION ENDOWMENT AND ART.
By ALEXANDER KLAUSNER
Alligator Writer
In 1990, David A. Cofrin was 
one of the founding donors of the 
Harn Museum. 
One decade later, a year after his 
death at the age of 85 in a hospice 
in August 2009, Cofrin has left the museum one last treasure trove of art.
Cofrin’s will left the Harn 312 
works of Asian art, with an ad-ditional $1 million endowment to purchase more.
“The 312 works that were added 
to the Asian collection were a tre-mendous gift,” said Tami Wroath, director of marketing and public relations for the museum. “Right 
now we have a little more than 
7,300 works of art in our collection total. So that 312 is a large chunk Harn founder makes

Up-and-coming comedic star Aziz An-
sari, famous for his work with sketch group 
Human Giant and recent NBC hit “Parks and Recreation,” will be coming to rock the socks off of Gainesville as the headliner of 
this year’s Gator Growl on Oct. 15.
The Kanye West-impersonating, food-
loving funny man is getting paid $100,000 
to perform his stand-up for The Gator Na-tion. 
The routine is sure to please everyone, 
said Bryan Griffin, spokesman for this year’s Gator Growl.
“We chose Aziz because he kind of rep-
resents the dynamic type of show we’re trying to do this year,” Griffin said. “We’re hoping he can help establish the show with 
the whole celebration-type theme.”
Celebration is the name of the game this 
year, Griffin said, adding that he and his 
team are working hard to make 
sure this year’s Growl is better 
than the last few. It should be 
fun for everyone, he said.
“This show is going to be completely dy-
namic from beginning to end,” Griffin said, 
“no lulls, no parts people will miss … a gi-
ant celebration.”
For one thing, the show has become 
more interactive. Students and alumni who want a chance to be a part of the show are 
encouraged to submit video skits at www.Aziz Ansari to headline

 How I Got An A @ UF, the note-taking 
business also known as Einstein Notes, 
closed its University Avenue storefront on Aug. 1 in favor of an online-only opera-tion.
  The move was done to reduce paper 
waste and create a more “environmentally 
friendly business,” according to Thomas Bean, who owns and manages the com-pany.
  The business was using as many as 
10,000 sheets of paper a month printing 
notes, Bean said. 
  “It was just ludicrous how much paper 
we were wasting and throwing away,” he said.
  The store has been transitioning into 
paperless operation for the past couple of 
years, Bean said.   The business started printing double-
sided pages in the fall of 2008 and started 
offering discounts on future purchases to those who brought back their study kits to the store to recycle.
  Eventually, Bean said, he hopes to take 
the effort to reduce waste a step further by publishing all advertisements and cou-pons exclusively through Facebook and Twitter.
    “Why even have a cash register?” Bean 
said.
  How I Got An A @ UF pays students to 
take notes in classes. Employees then edit 
and sell the notes.  Einstein Notes ditches storefront, slashes paper waste

 OTHER FLORIDA UNIVERSITY 
REPRESENTATIVES ATTENDED.

 As students jogged along the indoor track upstairs and ped-
aled on the exercise bikes near the tall glass windows, more 
than 100 faculty , staff, students and guests applauded Tuesday afternoon’s ribbon-cutting at the newly renovated Southwest Recreation Center.
  UF ofﬁ  cials, including President Bernie Machen, spoke to 
commemorate the building’s ofﬁ  cial grand opening.  Standing just inside the new front entrance, viewing the 
completed center for the ﬁ  rst time, Machen said it looked ‘spec-tacular.’
  “You know it’s a good renovation when you can’t remem-
ber the old building,” he said.
  Speaking to a crowd that included recreational-activities 
representatives from the University of Central Florida, University of South Florida, University of West Florida and Florida A&M University , 
Machen said he was impressed with the facility , 
which he called the cornerstone of the southwest corner of cam-
pus.
  “We want students to be healthy,” he said. “But more im-
portantly, we want to prepare them to be healthy for the rest of their lives.”
  After the ribbon-cutting, all were invited on tours of the fa-
cility, and cake was served in the lounge area, which has sev-eral large ﬂ  at screen televisions and a smoothie bar. 
  Robert Carroll, director of campus recreation at Florida 
A&M, said the additions and renovations make for a phenom-enal facility.
  “Now it looks like you’ve reclaimed your spot at the top of 
the recreational totem pole,” he said.
  Students rushed in for the RecSports Extravaganza, in which 
a few hundred students ﬂ  ocked to a basketball court for the Sport Clubs fair, ﬁ  tness demonstrations and free T-shirts.
  The Sport Clubs fair, which is typically held at the Broward 
Outdoor Recreation Complex, drew more interest than usual.  Machen speaks to crowd at ribbon-cutting for rec center
OnCampu sgatorgrowl.org as part of the Growl 
Minute of Fame competition. 
According to the website, submis-
sions should not be more than a min-ute long, should be family-friendly and sent in by 5 p.m. on Sept. 20.
The best three from students and 
the best three from alumni will be chosen by the event committee, then posted to the website to be voted on by everyone, Griffin said.
The night of the show, the first 
place videos from both groups will be shown, and attendees will be asked to text in votes for their favorite submis-sion.  The winner of the contest will 
be declared live.
There’s also a contest asking for 
submissions of photos from Gator sporting events.  The contest winner 
will be printed on the front page of 
the Gator Growl 2010 program, ac-
cording to the website.
Tickets for the event are $15 for 
students and $25 for general-admis-
sion tickets, but Grif-fin advises people to 
purchase tickets ear -
ly because all prices go up $5 the week of 
the show. 
Griffin said for 
the price, you can’t 
beat the entertain-
ment you’re sure to receive.
“This year is kind of a looking-
forward type thing because we’ve got a new line-up for football and a lot of things to be grateful for as a Gator,”    
Griffin said. WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 25, 2010 � ALLIGATOR, 5
His donation was Asian works
of that.”
The works originate from all over the 
continent, said Jason Steuber, the Cofrin 
Curator of Asian Art. The pieces come everywhere from central Asia to China, 
Tibet, Korea, Japan and down into south-
east Asia.
He said the works also come from all 
throughout history. Some originate from several thousand years B.C., while others originate from the contemporary era.
He said that Chinese jades from the 
Ming and Qing dynasties, which stretched from the 1300s to the 1900s, were an ex-
ample of the works that Cofrin left to the 
museum.
Cofrin’s donation, along with the 
museum’s existing Asian art collec-tion, will eventually be moved into the 26,000-square-foot David A. Cofrin Asian Art Wing, which will open its doors in 2012.
Prior to his death, Cofrin donated $10 
million to the construction of this wing. With the new donation and the new sec-tion to house, the current 130-piece Asian art collection will triple in size, he said.
Three new galleries will be featured in 
the wing along with the existing gallery, he said.
Though Cofrin’s name will forever be 
attached to the new wing, his philanthro-py was not strictly devoted to Asian art.
“He also assisted in acquisitions in the 
contemporary, the modern and the pho-
tography collection,” Wroath said.
The 312 works Cofrin donated to the 
museum are worth an estimated $4.2 mil-
lion.
Wroath said that over the course of his 
life, he donated more than $30 million to the museum.
“I think he believed in the mission 
of getting Gainesville an exceptional art museum,” Steuber said. “As well as, I think, filling the need here for a center for the arts on campus ... I think that was the grand scheme to develop a great cul-tural resource for not only the University 
of Florida, but also for the community at 
large.”HARN , from page 1

EDITORPaul RunnestrandStefania FerroMANAGING EDITORSDrew WilsonOPINIONS EDITORFreshmen should lose the facial hair
The grass is green. The flowers are blooming. And 
the chin pubes are sprouting.
As if on a mission from the almighty bearded 
king Chuck Norris himself,  freshmen guys have taken it upon themselves to exercise their first freedom away from home.
They treat the five-blade, best-invention-since-spell-
check Gillette Fusion like it’s some torturing device thought up by the Jigsaw Killer (when we already know the worst torturing device ever created is Miley Cyrus’ split personality).
As a result, freshman guys’ non-grizzled, but rather 
disgusting, faces could only be loved by their mothers.
And certainly not by any college girls.We get it. You’ve never gotten to grow your facial hair 
because your mom threatened to stop giving you latkes 
and brisket if you didn’t shave every morning. 
You’ve already gone a week without shaving now; 
you can see that you’ll never get more than a few scrag-
gly hairs.
Part of becoming a man is learning that some men are 
more endowed than others. Some have Burt Reynolds-like mustaches or beards like Al’s (from “Home Improve-ment”). Some have sparse strands of pubescence.
And you’re not alone. Our beloved No. 12 can’t grow 
more than a furry upper lip, and if the Florida Gators won’t even allow our future Heisman winner to wear a mini-Kerwin Bell-like, pencil-width mustache, what makes you think that your first facial hair actually looks manly?
Please, if you’re whiter than paper, and if you have hair 
darker than charcoal, please, please stay away from the leprechaun-esque chinstrap.
You have a better chance of looking like the Old Spice man while wearing a pink tutu and singing Justin Bieber while wearing a dozen Silly Bandz on 
each of your puny wrists then 
while sporting your forest of inch-long chin hairs.
If you can grow a Wolverine-
style beard, go for it… During Oc-tobeard or No-shave November, 
but not while we’re trying to enjoy the end of summer.
We’d be better off if you just drank the kool-aid. At 
least then you’d have kool-aid mustaches.
Confession time: I can’t grow real-man facial hair. It seems my Jewish 
and Greek heritage has overlooked myself and my sib-lings.
I cannot grow facial hair, so I’ve discovered a way 
around my disability....
I shave.Go figure. Instead of attempting to show my man-
hood through non-existent stubble, I show my manhood 
through tests of intestinal fortitude (see the Alligator’s vid-
eo of me eating Gator Dawg’s Ghost Chili Dog for proof). I also regularly sprint on shards of glass. (It prepares me for my future career as a pain-resistant superhero.)
If you’re going to be a manly freshman, then you need 
to eat 32-ounce steaks, run weekly marathons, bench press ACRs’ pick-up trucks and shave every day.
I get your man-envy for the goatee; I share your envy. 
But work around your youth and/or bad genes and shave. 
You’ll make UF look less like a school full of 12-year-old, 
non-stop cursing N00bz on “Halo.”

Happen to catch the 
Miss Universe Pag-eant Monday eve-
ning? Even know it was on TV? Yeah, we didn’t either.
But this year was special. 
And now we feel bad.  
For the first time in nearly 
two decades, the title of Miss Universe, at least for this year, belongs to Miss Mexico, breaking an apparent curse for our neighbor to the south.
And we couldn’t be hap-
pier for a pageant none of us watched. For a country rav-aged by drug-cartel violence, poverty and that is still recov-ering from the near $2 billion worth of damage Hurricane Wilma caused to some of the country’s most popular tour -
ist destinations, perhaps this 
is a simple start to recovery 
for Mexico. We realize a pag-eant winner can never hope to solve a country’s problems, but Miss Navarette, you’re surely going to have to try! You have the world’s spotlight now, so use that crown well! And considering one mem-ber of the Editorial Board just returned from a vacation in 
Mexico, we know the poverty 
first hand in that country.
We’ve seen children, 
grown women, elderly wom-en selling hand-crafted hand-kerchiefs for a dollar a piece on the road. We’ve seen the light in a child’s eyes when we gave him a dollar for a hand-
kerchief we didn’t need. 
So when we found out the 
United States lost again, (we 
haven’t won since 1997 if you don’t include Puerto Rico), we couldn’t have been happier to continue our own what-did-we-do-to-deserve-this-we’re-like-so-pretty losing streak.
It almost makes us sad we 
didn’t have any idea the pag-eant was going on. Almost.
We’re just glad Miss Mexi-
co wasn’t asked a really tough question about map reading.Bad Eggs
No one is safe from 
scary foods
Will it ever be safe to go back to the grocery store? 
Still cowering in fear at the supermarket, clutch-
ing our grocery baskets as we inspect product label 
numbers on cartons in our own, makeshift, at-home test for salmonella following a massive recall last week of more than a 
half billion eggs, and just when you thought it was OK to clip 
coupons, things just got scarier.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture recently announced 
380,000 pounds of lunch meat used in deli sandwiches at Wal-Mart stores nationwide may (or may not) be contaminated with Listeria.
According to the USDA, Listeria can cause high fevers, a stiff 
neck, nausea and (no big deal) listeriosis, which can be fatal. A stiff neck followed by a potentially-you-may-or-may-not-die-
a-horribly-painful death all because we were running late to 
class and grabbed a smokehouse hero sandwich from one of Wal-Mart’s deli cases? And don’t even think about making an omelet until this all settles down. 
As of Friday, more than 1,000 people have been exposed 
to the salmonella in the egg recall that affects 28 percent of the United States. 
Luckily, the egg recall has not yet reached Florida, but the 
Food and Drug Administration warns the outbreaks are not 
over. Cue the scary “Jaws” theme music. 
And listen up, all you smug vegans and vegetarians out 
there: You aren’t so immune to this either.
Leafy vegetables account for the third-most tainted food 
item behind poultry and beef, according to a recent Center for 
Disease Control report. 
Is it just us, or is grocery shopping becoming more like a 
game of “Press My Luck?”

letters@alligator.orgWEDNESDAY, AUGUST 25, 2010 � ALLIGATOR, 7
With the economy the way it is, most 
students would jump at the chance to earn some money while looking 
for a full-time job. That’s why many college students would jump at the chance to become a mystery shopper. All you have to do is make a particular purchase in a store or restaurant, 
and then evaluate their experience. Sounds 
too good to be true, right?
Well, it just might be. Recently, the Federal 
Trade Commission has noticed that mystery shopping companies may be targeting un-
dergraduate students and recent grads with 
bogus job opportunities.The scam starts out sounding legitimate. People answer an e-mail or advertisement looking for part-time work. 
The scammer tells you that they need mystery 
shoppers.
You can shop in your own time and collect 
a fee. If you’ve never been a mystery shopper, the next part won’t strike you as strange: the 
company is going to send you a check to use 
to buy the small items you need to purchase to appropriately rate a retailer. Legitimate mys-tery shopping companies do not do that. They 
pay only after you shop and file an evaluation 
form and the pay is a very modest amount.
The second red flag is that the check is go-
ing to be for a lot of money — likely $3,000 to $5,000 — which is vastly more than you need. 
The con-artist’s excuse for sending so much 
money is that they want you to take your fee out of the check, plus the cost of whatever you’re buying. And then, they want you to wire the rest of the mon-ey in order to suppos-edly evaluate a bank or 
wire service. They sug-
gest you wait until the check clears to send 
them the money. The check then bounces after the person wires the money, leaving the shop-
per liable for the fake check. People who ap-
ply for the secret shopper or mystery shopper jobs are told by the company that they have only 48 hours to complete the assignment or they will lose the job.
Arizona’s Attorney General says, “Con-
sumers need to know that a legitimate com-pany will never send you a cashier’s check out of the blue or require you to send money 
to someone you have never met.
 The scam artists use realistic looking 
documents, the ‘secret’ nature of the job, and 
the 48-hour deadline to pressure consumers into cashing the check and wiring the money 
quickly before the bank or the consumer can 
determine it was a fake check. By then, it’s too late.”

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS  
NEW YORK — New York City Mayor Mi-
chael Bloomberg says not allowing a mosque 
to be built near ground zero would be “com-promising our commitment to fighting terror with freedom.”
The mayor made the comment Tuesday in 
an impassioned speech at a dinner in obser -
vance of Iftar, the daily meal in which Mus-lims break their fast during the holy month of Ramadan.
Bloomberg says a compromise wouldn’t 
end the debate. He says the question would then become “how big should the no-mosque zone around the World Trade Center site be?”
Earlier Tuesday, Archbishop Timothy 
Dolan said after a meeting with Gov . David Paterson that New Yorkers share values of tol-erance and unity but he’s worried those values are at risk.
Paterson wants mosque leaders to consider 
an alternative location.
“We’re just a little bit apprehensive that 
these noble values may be a bit at risk in this way the conversation and debate about the site of the mosque is taking place,” Dolan said.
Mosque supporters say religious freedom 
should be protected.
A national survey underscored the complex 
views of Americans toward the mosque proj-ect, with 51 percent agreeing with opponents 
of the Muslim center, while 34 percent said 
they supported it. The poll of 1,003 randomly chosen adults was conducted by the nonpar -
tisan Pew Research Center and showed that a majority , 62 percent, also said Muslims have equal rights to build houses of worship.
Dolan said both sides of the debate have 
legitimate stances.
“I sure don’t have strong feelings on where the mosque should ultimately be,” he said 
during a brief news conference after meeting 
with the governor.
They spoke about how religion can be 
brought to bear on the debate over the propos-al in an effort to encourage reconciliation and community , rather than divisiveness, Dolan said, and expressed willingness to be part of the dialogue if asked.
“Do I have any concrete plans or steps? 
Nope,” he said.New York Assembly Speaker Sheldon Sil-
ver, who represents the lower Manhattan dis-trict where ground zero is, suggested Tuesday that Islamic leaders should move the proposed mosque. Paterson has made the same point.
Organizers have the right to build the cen-
ter at a building two blocks from ground zero but should be open to compromise, Silver said.
“In the spirit of living with others, they 
should be cognizant of the feelings of others and try to find a location that doesn’t engen-
der the deep feelings the currently exist about 
this site,” Silver said.
“I think the sponsors should take into very 
serious consideration the kind of turmoil that’s been created and look to compromise,” he added.
The developer, meanwhile, was expected to 
attend a dinner Tuesday night hosted by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who has spo-
ken in support of the project. Bloomberg holds 
the dinner annually to observe Iftar, the daily meal in which Muslims break their fast during the holy month of Ramadan.
Paterson has yet to meet with anyone from 
the Cordoba Initiative, the project’s organizer. Its co-founder, Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf, is on a Mideast trip funded by the U.S. State De-partment. He alluded to the controversy at 
a dinner Sunday night for student leaders at 
the U.S. ambassador’s residence in Manama, Bahrain.
“The fact we are getting this kind of atten-
tion is a sign of success,” he said.
“It is my hope that people will understand 
more. ... This is something we are doing for 
your generation.”
Rauf also thanked President Barack Obama, 
who has said Muslims had the right to practice 
their religion and build the Islamic center in lower Manhattan. The president later said he wasn’t endorsing the specifics of the plan.
“I’m grateful to President Obama for his 
support for the project,” said Rauf.
The White House on Tuesday said that 
Obama would have no further comment on the issue and that the administration will not 
get involved in talks about relocating the facil-
ity.
 Republicans have vowed to make Obama’s 
supportive comments a campaign issue in this fall’s midterm elections.NYC mayor supports mosque near WTC at Ramadan

MONTGOMERY, Ala. — A 
scarred but friendly pit bull 
named “Louis Vuitton” was the star witness Tuesday as an Ala-bama state board denied parole for the man convicted of spray-ing him with lighter fluid, setting 
him on fire and beating him with 
a shovel.
After the 8-year-old dog was 
led into the packed hearing room, the Alabama Board of Pardons 
and Paroles voted 3-0 to deny 
early release to 23-year-old Juan Daniels of Montgomery, who was sentenced in 2009 to nine years 
and six months in prison, a record 
in Alabama in an animal cruelty case.
Daniels, whose supporters said 
he had been sentenced far more 
harshly than criminals who harm 
human beings, will be eligible for parole again in July 2012.
The dog stuck his head forward 
for everyone who wanted to pet him as he entered. He bears burn scars from his head to his wag-ging tail, including white lines on his brown body where the burn-
ing lighter fluid seared his skin.
“You have to see the scars to see what was done to him,” said 
the dog’s owner, Dee Hartley of Montgomery. She and her hus-
band adopted the dog after the 
torture incident.
It’s unusual for a dog or other 
animal to make an appearance be-
fore such a panel.
“I don’t recall every having 
one here before,” said Cynthia 
Dillard, executive director of the 
Alabama Board of Pardons and 
Paroles.
The September 2007 attack 
on the dog drew wide notice. 
The Montgomery Humane Soci-
ety got as many as 50 calls a day 
about the case, 
some from other countries. The dog was given the 
name of a French fashion brand, “Louis Vuitton,” in honor of a dog named “Gucci,” whose tor -
ture case in Mobile in 1994 led to 
passage of “Gucci’s law,” which 
made animal cruelty a felony in Alabama.
More than 60 law enforcement 
officers, animal rights advocates 
and other supporters of Louis 
crowded into the hearing. Rela-tives and friends of Daniels also faced the board and asked that he 
be released.
Montgomery County District 
Attorney Ellen Brooks asked parole board members to make Daniels serve his entire sentence 
because of his cruelty to the dog and the nine disciplinary actions 
taken against him in prison.
“The first reason to deny pa-
role is to prevent him from hurt-
ing another animal or a person,” 
Brooks said.
 She said he was accused of 
torturing the dog, which then be-
longed to his mother, because he 
was angry at her for not letting 
him use the car.
A cousin, Thomas Hudson, 
said after the hearing he didn’t 
think it was fair because Daniels 
is behind bars with “folks who 
committed more extensive crimes than he committed.”
Holladay Simmons, the veteri-
narian who treated Louis imme-
diately after he was burned, told 
the board the dog’s wounds were as bad as she had ever seen.
Matt Cooper, the county ani-
mal cruelty officer who responded to the call, said after the hearing, “I’ve worked cases where people let their dog starve to death, but this was the worst case of animal 
cruelty that I’ve seen.”
Louis stood patiently outside 
the parole board offices after the 
hearing as people lined up to pat 
him on the head. 
He nuzzled up to many of his 
admirers, giving some a big, juicy lick on the face.No parole for convicted dog torturer; victim wags tail

MIAMI — Florida joined eight other 
states and the District of Columbia Tuesday 
in winning the second round in the Depart-
ment of Education’s “Race to the Top” com-
petition, which has spurred a wave of edu-cation reform across the country.
The 10 applicants have been chosen along 
with two first-round winners for grants to-taling about $4.35 billion.
Florida’s education leaders stated in their 
application that they want to use the funds to double the percentage of incoming high 
school freshmen who graduate and go on to 
college. They also want cut the achievement gap in half by 2015 and increase the percent-age of students scoring at or above proficient 
on the National Assessment of Education 
Progress.
Florida will be awarded up to $700 mil-
lion to accomplish those goals.
“Florida’s students, teachers and schools 
won a great victory today,” Gov. Charlie Crist said.Florida applied for the first round of the 
competition and was named a finalist, but only Delaware and Tennessee were given initial grants. About $3.4 billion remained for the second-round winners.
The other winners announced by the 
Education Department Tuesday are: Geor -
gia, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Maryland, New 
York, North Carolina, Ohio, Rhode Island 
and Washington, D.C.
“These states show what is possible 
when adults come together to do the right thing for children,” U.S. Education Secretary 
Arne Duncan said. “Every state that applied 
showed a tremendous amount of leader -
ship and a bold commitment to education reform.”
Florida’s plan calls for making sure 
teachers are well chosen, trained and held accountable for student achievement. The state’s application said teachers will be ex-pected to provide a “culture of rigor” for 
students and work to improve their practice, 
by data analysis and peer collaboration.
“With this critical funding secured we will be able to accelerate the academic prog-ress of our students, provide assistance to our low-performing schools and develop a system that properly recognizes and re-wards our hardest working teachers,” Edu-cation Commissioner Eric Smith said.
In its first round, unions in only five 
districts supported the state’s application, 
which linked teacher pay to student test 
scores. In the second round, Gov. Char -
lie Crist pulled together a working group consistent of union, local and state school 
leaders, in the end achieving 
a broad consensus of support.
“This award means the outstanding col-
laboration in Florida has been recognized,” U.S. Rep. Kathy Castor, D-Tampa, said, add-
ing that the award, coupled with $555 mil-lion from an education jobs bill approved by Congress, “will help our financially strug-gling school districts offer a quality educa-
tion for Florida children.”
The Race to the Top program has been 
a game changer in education, with states embarking on ambitious reforms that lifted 
caps on charter schools and created new teacher evaluations in hopes of boosting 
their chance of receiving funds. A majority, 
including Florida, also approved adoption of Common Core standards, the set of uni-form reading and math benchmarks created 
by a coalition of state leaders.
“Competition is something we haven’t 
had in the school system, in terms of com-
peting for dollars,” Andy Ford, president of the Florida Education Association, the 
statewide teacher’s union, said. “The fed-
eral involvement in education has been on a formula basis, and this is a whole new way of thinking.”
Wayne Blanton, executive director of the 
Florida Association of School Boards, noted that $700 million spread out over four years is not much in a state that spends $20 billion a year on K-12 education.
“It will have a small economic effect and 
a huge policy effect,” he said.
Blanton said that there will likely be 
tough negotiating in the weeks ahead, as 
states complete agreements with their local 
unions on the details of their plans.
“Now comes the tough part,” he said.Florida a winner in ‘Race to the Top’ competition

NEW ORLEANS — The moment cut 
sharply through the chaos, suffering and 
fear of Hurricane Katrina — a small boy 
sobbed hysterically as he was separated 
from his dog Snowball while departing the wretched Louisiana Superdome.
Snowball was one of thousands of 
pets split up from their owners after the storm struck Aug. 29, 2005, and the story triggered an outpouring of help to save stranded animals and reunite them with their families.
The heart-wrenching tale also spawned 
new state and federal laws allowing evac-uees to take their pets with them.
“For the first time, there was the real-
ization of the strength of the human-ani-mal bond,” said Ana Zorrilla, CEO of the Louisiana Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. “That sparked incred-ible changes on state and federal levels re-
quiring that pets be included in all evacu-
ation plans.”
Congress passed the Pets Evacuation 
and Transportation Standards Act in 2006, 
requiring plans for the evacuation of pets, 
as well as people.
The act was tested in 2008 during Hur -
ricane Gustav, and it worked.
Crates for pets were placed at evacu-
ation pickup points. Animals and their owners were banded with matching com-puter codes, and the animals were taken to the same locations as their owners, allow-
ing them to spend time together.
But things didn’t go as smoothly three years earlier as the dirty water rose in New 
Orleans streets.
 People were rescued, but countless 
times they had to leave their pets behind 
as helicopters plucked them from rooftops 
or boats drove them to safety.
Sandra Henry, 58, floated with her 
black lab, Tasha, to a rescue point where 
helicopters were ferrying victims to dry 
land. 
Along with an 87-year-old disabled 
woman and about a dozen relatives, Hen-ry was rescued, but had to leave Tasha.
“I took Tasha home, crying all the way,” 
Henry said. “I left all the food I had out and opened the doors and windows. Leav-
ing her here was so hard, but what else 
could I do?”
It took almost two years for Henry and 
Tasha to be reunited. The dog had been ad-
opted and living in Colorado.
“I thought about her every day,” Henry 
said. “When she got home she knew me 
right away.”It wasn’t long before the poignant pic-
tures and stories of abandoned pets had volunteer animal rescuers joining the search for stranded people. Houses were spray-painted with information about bodies found and pets rescued.
The SPCA and 200 other organizations 
saved more than 8,000 pets after the hur -
ricane. MuttShack, which was formed be-cause of Katrina, rescued more than 3,000. 
SPCA supporters also donated more than 
$15 million to assist animal rescue efforts and to rebuild Gulf Coast shelters follow-ing Hurricane Katrina.
But some of the pets weren’t so lucky.
Glenda Smith left her dogs, Max, a Jack 
Russell terrier, and Zack, a Chesapeake re-
triever, at home. 
Her neighbors were riding out the 
storm and were to take care of them, she said. Her dogs were rescued, but when she got to the facility where they were being held, only Zack was waiting.
“I can’t believe after all this time it’s 
still so painful,” Smith said. “I just hope whoever has him loves him as much as I do.”
Snowball was also lost.
He was taken from his family as they 
scrambled through a long line for a bus 
that would take them away from the heat, stench and misery of the Superdome where thousands of those who couldn’t make it 
out of the city were stranded. As the little 
boy wept and called his dog’s name, his fa-ther swept him up in his arms and moved on in the line, unwilling to sacrifice a spot 
on the bus.WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 25, 2010 � ALLIGATOR, 11

Pet evacuation a priority in post-Katrina New Orleans� THE CLASS-SIZE LIMIT 
WAS IMPOSED IN 2002.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
SALT LAKE CITY — Former 
Florida Gov. Jeb Bush told Utah of-
ficials on Tuesday that there’s little evidence to link smaller class sizes and student achievement.
“I do not know of any research 
that suggests that lower-class size has any impact on student learning until you get down to a significantly lower number,” Bush said. “And the research there is very scant.”
Bush made the comments about 
class sizes in response to a question by Utah Gov . Gary Herbert, who 
was chairing an education meeting 
Bush was invited to address.
Utah has long been home to the 
nation’s largest class sizes largely because it has the nation’s high-est birth rate and spends less per student than any other state. In the 2008-2009 school year, the most re-cent year for which comparable 
statistics were available, there were 
23.7 students for every teacher, about eight more than the national average.
Herbert is keenly aware of that 
fact as he enters his first election on the top of the GOP ticket, with his Democratic rival planning to make education one of the race’s key is-sues.
In 2002, Florida voters approved 
a constitutional amendment cap-ping class sizes that Bush — who was governor from 1999 to 2007 — vigorously opposed. Previously , class size averages were calculated at the schoolwide level.
The toughest requirements of the 
Florida amendment goes into effect this week.
“Every class in every school in 
every district in the state has to meet that mandate,” Bush said. “You can think of the logistical challenge. ... It’s going to be a nightmare.”
Bush is working to get Florida 
voters to approve an amendment on this year’s ballot that 
would loosen the 
class-size requirements.
A Harvard University study re-
leased in May said Florida’s class 
size amendment has had no discern-ible effect on student achievement. 
The Florida Education Associa-
tion, the statewide teachers union which supports the amendment, 
however, dismissed the study when 
it came out. It said it was biased be-
cause it came from a program linked 
to Bush.

Shumway said there’s significant 
research to show class size has the 
greatest impact on minority stu-dents.Former Fla. governor

OIL SPILL
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
HOUSTON — Federal investi-
gators probing the blowout that led 
to the Gulf oil spill grilled a Halli-burton official Tuesday about con-
cerns the petroleum services firm 
raised over the potential for a severe 
gas flow problem if a BP plan was used.
Halliburton and BP were at odds 
over a key device, known as a cen-
tralizer, that is used as part of the 
process to plug a deepwater well like the oil giant was doing at the time of the disaster. Halliburton’s 
well design expert testified he told 
BP officials April 15 — five days 
before the well blew — that fewer centralizers would cause a bigger gas flow problem.
Centralizers are meant to en-
sure casing runs down the center 
of the well bore. If casing strings 
are cemented off-center, there is a 
risk that a channel of drilling fluid or contaminated cement will be left where the casing contacts the oil for -
mation, creating an imperfect seal.
BP rejected Halliburton’s recom-
mendation to use 21 centralizers. In-stead, BP used six centralizers.
The April 20 blowout of BP’s un-
dersea well, which killed 11 work-ers and caused 206 million gallons 
of oil to spew, was triggered by a 
bubble of methane gas that escaped 
from the well and shot up the drill column, expanding quickly as it burst through several seals and bar -
riers before exploding, according to 
interviews with rig workers con-
ducted during BP’s internal investi-gation and obtained by The Associ-ated Press in May.
E-mails released by Congress in 
June show that a BP engineering official conveyed Halliburton’s con-clusions to a BP well team leader and his own concerns that BP need-
ed to install the extra centralizers. 
The well team leader responded he 
didn’t like the idea because it would take 10 hours to install them.
“BP then in turn decided not to 
run the additional centralizers with-
out consulting me or their in-house 
specialists,” Jesse Gagliano, the Hal-liburton official, told members of the joint U.S. Coast Guard-Bureau of Energy Management, Regula-tion and Enforcement investigative panel.
Tuesday’s testimony was part of 
the panel’s fourth session of hear -
ings aimed at determining the cause of the explosion and how regula-tion, safety and oversight can be improved.
After answering questions posed 
by the Coast Guard and other panel members, Gagliano was grilled by attorneys representing some of the other parties involved, including BP . 
The oil giant’s attorney often took 
on a sarcastic tone, repeating ques-
tions and responding with disbelief at times to Gagliano’s answers.
Gagliano was asked to read the 
e-mail he received April 20, about 
three hours be-fore the well 
blew out, from Halliburton’s en-
gineer on board 
the rig. “We have 
completed the job and it went well,” the rig-bound en-
gineer wrote to 
Gagliano. The attorney noted the 
engineer made no reference to gas flow problems or BP’s decision to use fewer centralizers.
Pointing to another 12-page 
document, prepared by Gagliano, the attorney asked if it reflected his “best engineering judgment and analysis.”
“No, this reflects what was actu-
ally pumped,” Gagliano answered. “No, my best engineering analysis would have been to run 21 central-
izers.”
In addition to operating the 
Deepwater Horizon rig that explod-
ed, BP owned a majority interest in the ruptured undersea well. Trans-
ocean Ltd. owned the rig. Anadarko 
Petroleum held a minority interest 
in the well.
The documents released in June 
include a series of e-mail exchanges 
between BP well team leader John 
Guide and BP drilling engineering 
team leader Gregory Walz. In an April 16 e-mail, Walz said he had located an additional 15 centralizers 
in Houston and could fly them out 
to the Deepwater Horizon.
Suggesting he knew he would 
get some resistance, Walz added: 
“I do not like or want to disrupt 
your operations and I am a full be-
liever that the rig needs only one 
team leader. I know the planning has been lagging behind the opera-tions and I have to turn that around. I apologize if I have over step my bounds.”
Later the same day , Guide 
panned the idea in part because of the time it would take to install the extra centralizers. “I do not like this,” Guide wrote in an e-mail to Walz.Nathaniel Chaisson, a Hallibur -
ton cementer who was on the rig as-
sisting with the job, said he saw the 
additional centralizers on board the rig, but BP still decided against us-ing them.
Also Tuesday, a Transocean of-
ficial said a high-ranking employee indicated a pressure test problem had been resolved hours before BP’s Gulf of Mexico well blew out.
Daun Winslow told the govern-
ment panel that there was confusion among workers in the drill shack, who were talking before the explo-sion about a negative pressure test, 
a procedure typically done before 
a well is plugged. Later in his testi-
mony , Winslow backtracked, saying instead he would characterize what was happening in the room as a 
“discussion” rather than confusion.
Winslow said he left while the 
drill team and tool pushers were 
discussing the pressure test to avoid disturbing them. He said the highest-ranking Transocean person on the rig later gave him a “thumbs up,” indicating it had been resolved.
BP drilling engineer Brian Mo-
rel invoked his constitutional right not to answer questions before the panel Tuesday.

Senior offensive lineman Mike Pouncey 
has some advice for Florida’s highly touted 
recruiting class. 
And it has nothing to do with adjusting 
to the speed of college football, living away from home for the first time or better under -
standing the game. 
“At the end of the day the freshmen need 
to just shut their mouth and come play,” Pouncey said. “They haven’t done anything on Saturday, and most of the fans don’t even know who they are. So, until they prove 
themselves, they just need to sit back and let 
the older guys play.”
The Gators brought in the second-best re-
cruiting class in the nation, according to Ri-
vals.com, signing four five-star and 17 four-
star players. 
Three of those five-star prospects — Do-
minique Easley, Sharrif Floyd and Ronald Powell — are defensive linemen, which has 
led to plenty of expectations and hyperbole 
for the group.
“Ronald Powell is Chris Bosh, Sharrif 
[Floyd] is Dwyane Wade and I’m LeBron 
[James],” Easley said at UF’s Media Day, 
drawing a comparison to the Miami Heat’s free-agent class.  
Pouncey said the trio isn’t as cocky as some 
of the other freshmen, but Easley’s quote 
shows a little of bit of what concerns Urban 
Meyer with the season opener less than two weeks away.  
“You have 25 young players — or whatev-
er it is — that think they’re going to go domi-nate the way they did in high school, and they have no idea what’s about to hit them,” Meyer said.
Meyer has a reputation for playing his best players regardless of seniority, and that 
won’t be any different this season. 
The veteran players are counted on to 
make sure the rookies understand how de-
manding a college football season can be. 
“You don’t want to beat up on them and 
tear down their confidence, you want to help them,” redshirt senior Carl Johnson said. “You want to show your dominance but also be a great teammate. So I think that’s one 
thing veteran guys do here. 
“It’s kind of like a father-son lesson.” 
Redshirt senior linebacker A.J. Jones re-
members coming in with the 2006 recruiting class that included Tim Tebow, Percy Harvin 
and Brandon Spikes. 
Jones said his class, which also included 
Johnson, was just as cocky, but the older 
players on the team helped humble them and 
let them know that their time would come. 
“A lot of them come in 
[cocky]. A lot got to adjust fast,” Jones said. “Us older guys just 
try to tell them, ‘We had to wait 
our turn to play. It was rough 
at the beginning, but just keep working hard and everything will get better.’”
Meyer said this recruiting class might 
come across more arrogant or entitled than previous classes simply because there are so many heralded freshmen — 25 to be exact, after Jordan Haden and Adrian Coxson de-
cided to transfer. 
Arrogance aside, having that many fresh-
men who can potentially contribute to win-
ning right away is a good problem for a head 
coach. 
“That’s kind of standard operating proce-
dure when you get a highly recruited play-
er, but it seems like we have more of them, which is good,” Meyer said. “They’ll learn to 
do it.”

If you flipped through Tuesday’s sports section, you 
saw the college football top-25 polls from each of our four columnists.
If you read mine, you already know it better than I do.I mailed it in. By that, I mean I told our esteemed edi-
tor, Anthony Chiang, to do it for me (he’ll be writing my papers and letting me steal his lunch this semester too).
As much as I like making Chiang do things for me, I 
would rather have abstained.
I’m not qualified to rank the best 25 teams in the na-
tion. Odds are, you aren’t either, nor are most of the me-dia members in the Associated Press poll.
There are too many teams, too many players and too many question marks about all of them to make accurate predictions on a wide scale. Beyond that, no teams 
have played a down of football yet, 
so it’s all based on hype and who is supposed to be good.
I know one team well enough to 
make a guess about how its season will go: Florida.
And even with UF, I’m hardly an 
expert.
Sure, I spend large parts of my day talking and writing 
about the Gators, but I’ve yet to see them so much as run a sprint because fall practices are closed to the media.
So how can I know how good they are until they play? It’s all speculation, and that’s all preseason polls are.
That makes for some interesting debate — a large part 
of the entertainment factor of sports — but here’s where it 
turns from me being a buzzkill to a real problem.
In college football, polls actually matter.
Unlike an NFL power poll, college rankings affect who 
gets to play for the national championship. The USA To-
day coaches’ poll, Harris poll and computer rankings all play a part in the BCS formula.Meaningless early polls determine meaningful postseason rankings

NEW YORK — Bobby 
Bowden did not want to retire.
“Fired might be a little too 
strong,” the former Florida State 
coach said Tuesday in an inter -
view with The Associated Press. “Pushed out ain’t bad. I was pushed out, no doubt about it. I didn’t want but one more year. Gosh, I’m 80.”
The coach doesn’t act bitter, 
but he wants to make sure the record is straight.
“I didn’t want them to spread 
the story that I voluntarily, hap-pily resigned,” said Bowden, who was in New York to begin a promotional tour for his new book, “Called to Coach.”
The affable Alabama native 
rolled up 389 victories (though 12 were vacated by the NCAA), second behind Joe Paterno in major college football in a 44-year head coaching career.
But Florida State went 38-28 
in his last five seasons and the board of trustees and then-uni-versity president T.K. Wetherell thought after last season it was time for a change.
Bowden said Wetherell pre-
sented him with two alterna-tives.
“Number one, you can stay 
as ambassador coach. I don’t think I’ve ever heard of an am-bassador coach in my life. I said, ‘Well, what is an ambassador coach?’
“He said, ‘Well, you can re-
main the head coach but you can’t coach out on the field.’ Now how can I be the head 
coach of this team if I can’t go 
out on the field? So I said, ‘Well that’s out.’
“So I said, ‘What’s the next al-
ternative?’ The next alternative, 
we ain’t going to renew your 
contract,” Bowden said with a big laugh. “Does that sound like I resigned?”
When Bowden was an assis-
tant coach at Florida State in the 1960s, he coached Wetherell and got to know his family.
“He and I were pretty close,” 
Bowden said. “I thought I was safe.”
Bowden said his relationship 
with Wetherell has likely been i r r e p a r a b l y damaged.
“I doubt if I’ll have a rela-
tionship with T.K. anymore,” he said.
Wetherell acknowledged that 
ultimately it was his decision to remove Bowden and let Jimbo Fisher, who had already been designated Bowden’s successor, take over in 2010.
“Of course I made the de-
cision, who else could have?” Wetherell told the AP .
While Bowden was not al-
lowed to end his career on his own terms, he insists he doesn’t miss coaching.
“I love Florida State,” he said. 
“I’ll be pulling for them. I’ll be pulling for Jimbo. I didn’t want to sit there and be looking over his shoulder.
“People have to make the 
transition from me to him.”WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 25, 2010 � ALLIGATOR, 21
Coaches don’t have nearly enough time to watch every 
team around the country (not to mention they have their 
own agendas), computers can’t watch football games, and I’ve heard enough press-box chatter during the last three years to know that media votes are often made without much research.In politics, we have a law mandating that candidates 
have the opportunity for equal airtime on radio and tele-vision. That doesn’t exist in college football.
While the AP poll doesn’t have a direct effect on the 
BCS and the Harris poll doesn’t kick in until a few weeks into the season, preseason rankings do affect how we judge a team’s performance as the year wears on.
I don’t want to turn this into another column begging 
for a playoff (seriously though, please?) but I hate that the sport’s champion is partially decided by votes rather than on the field.
A day before the AP poll came out (with UF at No. 4), a 
reporter asked Florida defensive end Justin Trattou what 
he thought the rankings would be.
“That means absolutely nothing because we’re still go-
ing to go out and play the season,” he said.
I agree completely. I just wish the polls were still mean-
ingless after the season has played out.

When freshman setter Chanel Brown 
steps onto the court for Florida’s open-
ing match, she will instantly accomplish a number of career firsts.  
The first match of her collegiate career, 
her first career start and her first non-club match at a new position all figure to come 
in the team’s first game, and all in front of 
the biggest crowd she’s ever played for.  
Still, Brown isn’t feeling an ounce of 
unwanted stress.
“I really like the pressure,” Brown said. 
“I just like working hard, and going to-
ward a goal of winning.”
After four years of playing outside hit-
ter at Chandler (Ariz.) Valley Christian 
High, Brown consulted with many of her 
current and future coaches.
To maximize her potential at the next 
level, Brown switched to setter.  
Evidently those coaches were right. It 
took Brown just a single club season and a few weeks of practice to earn the role of 
starting setter on one of the nation’s top 
teams. 
“We thought she had a chance to see 
playing time right away, but when we first 
started recruiting her we didn’t project her 
to start as a freshman,” coach Mary Wise said. “She’s doing exactly what you want in college sports, and that’s when the op-portunity presents itself to take full advan-tage of it.”
Although Brown was a 2009 American 
Volleyball Coaches Association All-Amer -
ican who led the nation in kills as an out-
side hitter, her height (5-foot-9) meant it 
would be necessary to make a positional 
switch if she were to successfully transi-tion to the college game. 
Wise, like many other coaches Brown 
encountered during the recruiting pro-cess, decided she would fit perfectly into 
the setter role due to her foot speed and 
athleticism. 
“Her physical traits and leadership 
skills are really tailor-made for the setting position,” Wise said. “It’s not a stretch to think that Chanel could be the best back-
row defensive setter that we’ve had here 
in this program.”
Because her skills fit the position per -
fectly, Brown has been able to make the 
transition with relative ease. 
Even though the termi-
nology, speed of the game and quality of athletes have all presented chal-
lenges, Brown is happy 
she made the move.
“It’s been an amazing 
experience,” Brown said. 
“I love the transition from 
outside hitter to setter, and I wouldn’t 
change back.
“I love running the offense, the fast 
pace of everything, and being able to play with such amazing athletes.”
Brown’s step up to the collegiate level 
would have been a difficult one even with-out the positional change, as she moved from a small Arizona private school to one of the most heavily populated public uni-versities in the country. 
After four years of playing in front of 
just a few dozen fans in her high school 
gymnasium, the freshman will jump to the 
O’Connell Center, which drew more than 
2,500 fans for last season’s home opener. 
“The Orange and Blue game was the 
biggest crowd I’ve played for so far,” Brown said. “But I’m not even nervous, I’m just excited to go out there and play 
for Gator Nation and for all the fans that 
come out and support all of us.”
It should come as no surprise that 
Brown isn’t feeling any pressure, as the 
2009 Arizona State Championship MVP 
once notched an astounding 26 kills and 19 digs in the biggest match of her life, lead-ing her team to a come-from-behind vic-tory in the championship match.
“That state game was very intense and 
so much fun to be in,” Brown said. “I’m so proud of my high school team that we came out and won state, but now it’s a na-tional championship we’re looking for.” Brown to start at setter despite never playing position

RECRUITIng
By TOM gREEn
Alligator Writer
tgreen@alligator.org
With the recent string of Tampa Plant High 
athletes making their oral commitments in the 
last two weeks, one more decided to join the fun.
Without the flair and hoopla that came 
with the announcements of schoolmates James Wilder Jr., Phillip Ely and Tony Posada — all football players, four-star junior shoot-ing guard Michael Frazier orally committed to play for the Gators late Monday night.
According to Bob Horodyski, Frazier’s 
AAU coach, Frazier committed early because he wanted to finish the recruiting process and all the mail and phone calls that go with being 
a sought-after recruit. He chose UF because of the proximity to his family and the chance to 
play for coach Billy Donovan and the program he built.
His decision makes him Donovan’s first re-
cruit for the class of 2012.
“I was a little surprised that he committed 
this early,” Horodyski said. “But it was prob-ably a smart thing to do. He felt comfortable with Billy (Donovan). … I think he’s got a great opportunity at Florida.”
Listed at 6-foot-4, Frazier is rated by Rivals.
com as the 13th-best two guard in the class of 2012.
He received offers from nearly a dozen 
schools and, according to Horodyski, even 
garnered attention from Duke and North Car -
olina.
As a sophomore at Plant last season, Fra-
zier averaged 26.7 points per game, while also pulling down almost eight boards per contest. 
After scoring 695 points last year, Frazier be-came the first sophomore in Hillsborough County history to surpass the 1,000 career points mark.
“He’s probably one of the best shooters I’ve 
ever coached,” Horodyski said. “He’s got deep range, and not only can he shoot open jump shots, but he can rise and shoot over people … with pretty good accu-racy . He’s a marksman, no 
doubt about it. He can flat out shoot the ball.”
Horodyski said Frazier’s 
shooting touch reminds him of former UF guard Kenyan Weaks. During his four sea-sons at UF, Weaks shot nearly 43 percent from beyond the arc, making him one of the most prolific shooters in school history.
While Horodyski heaped praise on Fra-
zier’s offensive game, adding that he is ad-ept at attacking the basket and finishing well with both hands, he said the 180-pound guard 
needs to work  on his defense and ball-han-
dling skills.
However, he still has two seasons to perfect 
those facets of his game before enrolling at UF, Horodyski said. In addition to basketball, Fra-zier also serves as the director of the choir at 
his father’s church.
“As great a basketball player as he is, and 
he’ll become, he’s probably a better person,” 
Horodyski said. “That’s rare to come by these days.”
Oral commitments are non-binding until on or 
after National Signing Day.

� MIAMI RANKED LAST IN YARDS ALLOWED PER 
PASS LAST SEASON.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
DAVIE — Miami Dolphins cornerback Sean Smith started 
all 16 games as a rookie and broke up a dozen passes but failed 
to catch any. His interception total: zero.
Did he find it frustrating to be shut out? Embarrassing? 
Shocking?
“I’m going to go with all of the above,” Smith said. “It took 
awhile for me to get over it.”Such are the growing pains for a young cornerback, whose 
every misstep can become fodder for highlight shows. The Dol-phins had rookies at both cornerback spots last year, one rea-son they ranked last in the league in yards allowed per pass.
Smith and V ontae Davis are back for a second 
season, looking to make more plays and fewer mistakes. Their anticipated improvement would help solidify a Miami defense revamped after a disappointing 2009 season.
“If those two guys compete every play like we 
know they can, we’ll be a very good defense,” strong safety Yeremiah Bell says. “If they clamp down, it means more sacks for the d-line and more interceptions for the safeties and line-backers. It makes life so much easier.”
The Dolphins made the two young cornerbacks their top 
draft choices in 2009 with the expectation the team would be set at the position for years. 
Davis joined Smith in the starting lineup in October as a 
replacement for veteran Will Allen, who underwent season-ending knee surgery.
“When we first came in, everybody was comparing us to 
Surtain and Madison,” Smith says. “Those are real big shoes. And when you give up a touchdown, and the crowd is on your 
back and yelling things, it would be easy for a guy to tank it. 
“Even the best get beat. We understand that. You have to be 
the most arrogant guys on the field sometimes.”Dolphins to rely on pair of second-year cornerbacks

Columnist Predictions
Florida is coming into the season with 
more questions than answers, but I’m 
about to fix that.
The Gators are going to lose one game 
in the regular season and it won’t be 
against Alabama. They will rout Miami (Ohio) and interstate “rival” USF before 
getting into the meat of their schedule. 
Next, they will go on the road to play 
Tennessee, but UF will blow that one open 
in the second half. The Vols are throwing out  junior college transfer  Matt Simms 
to be their quarterback — no, that’s not a 
good thing for Tennessee.
UF’s next game will be dedicated to Tim 
Tebow as it goes up against Kentucky, the 
team that gave him the concussion. If that 
wasn’t enough to motivate the Gators to a blowout victory, they are facing a coach named Joker.
These first four games will be crucial 
to quarterback John Brantley’s success. By this time he will have cemented his name in the Heisman Trophy race, amassing 1,100 passing yards and 10 touchdown 
passes.
But his next game will be the true test.
Alabama will be close, but UF will win 
this one. The Crimson Tide won’t be as strong as analysts predict. It loses eight 
of its 11 starters on defense and Florida 
will expose that as Brantley continues his surge to prominence with 275 yards pass-ing in the contest.
At this point, the Gators will be ranked No. 2. They will turn 
that momentum into 
a close win over LSU before slipping up against Mississippi State in their home-
coming game.
I know it sounds 
crazy, but Florida 
has fallen to a team 
from the Southeast-
ern Conference West in each of the last 11 
seasons, and former Gators offensive co-ordinator Dan Mullen will come up with a great game plan to baffle the Gators de-
fense. 
UF will blow through its next four 
games before making the trip up to Tal-
lahassee to earn a hard-fought victory 
against FSU.
That will bring the Gators to the re-
match everybody will be waiting for — 
UF and Alabama in the SEC Champion-ship Game. 
The Crimson Tide will take this one, 
which will leave Florida playing in the Sugar Bowl for a second straight year.
Brantley will end the season with at 
least 3,500 passing yards and 40 touch-downs through the air — just enough to make fans forget about their beloved 
Tebow for a year.
UF will finish second in the SEC stand-
ings, and Brantley will be the runner up 
for the Heisman Trophy.Since the Sugar Bowl in January, al-
most all talk concerning Florida has 
surrounded new quarterback John 
Brantley. But the Gators face a more press-
ing issue than replacing Tim Tebow. The team lost two linebackers, two defensive 
ends, two defensive backs and the coordi-
nator from a unit that held opponents to 
12.4 points per game.
Up front, the Gators have plenty of 
options, including several backups from 
last year’s team. But, on paper, no play-
ers have excited fans more than freshmen 
Ronald Powell, Dominique Easley and Sharrif Floyd. The super trio — along with 
Chris Martin, a California signee who 
transferred to Florida on July 20 — was 
christened by some recruiting analysts as 
“The Greatest Defensive Line Class Ever (or until our hyperbole gets out of control 
again next year).”  
Coach Urban Meyer has tried to curb 
fans’ enthusiasm since training camp 
opened, calling his freshman class “an OK group” and saying Powell in particular 
has not played well enough to earn mean-
ingful minutes this season.
But Rivals.com listed Powell as the No. 
1 overall recruit in the nation for a reason, so expect the defensive end to adapt to 
whatever problems are holding him back. 
He’s 248 pounds and ran a 4.52-forty at 
some high school combines. He returned a blocked kick for a touchdown and also caught one in the U.S. Army All-American Bowl. High school pictures revealed he has eight-pack abs!
He will start by 
Sept. 18, when Flori-da plays Tennessee.
Also expect to 
see a lot of first-year 
safety Matt Elam, 
the brother of Cleve-land Browns safety Abram Elam and 
the No. 2 recruit at 
his position, according to Rivals. Meyer 
said Elam reported to the team “doughy” this summer but got back in shape before camp started.
Elam will stay behind Ahmad Black 
and Will Hill on the depth chart, but he should see the field in the “Magic” pack-age, which is just the 2010 version of the “Joker” package.
But even with both those players 
emerging, the defense will not post num-bers similar to last season. Excluding the Southeastern Conference Championship Game, the 2009 unit was special, and re-
placing Joe Haden, Brandon Spikes and 
Ryan Stamper will be tough.
Speaking of that one misstep, forget 
the Alabama game this season. You know 
it will be hyped, but the more important 
matchup will be against a Georgia team 
hungry to bounce back after a couple bad 
years.
When the Gators win their third straight 
meeting against the Bulldogs, Florida will face Alabama for a second time in 2010. 
It all seemed so preordained a season ago. The Gators would play in the South-eastern Championship Game and a BCS 
bowl game, and Timmy would end his sea-son in New York, pushing for another Heis-man Trophy. 
Not everyone saw the season going the exact same way, but those three things were almost givens from the 
very beginning. 
This year, nothing is a given. 
Except for wins against Miami (Ohio), 
USF and Appalachian State. Although, I’m sure Michigan said the same thing before becoming the victim of the biggest upset in college football history.
Florida has enough talent to contend 
for another national championship, but many of the players that will be relied upon are inexperienced. 
John Brantley has never started a game, 
Deonte Thompson is the only wide receiv-er or tight end with more than 14 career receptions and the defense is replacing six starters. 
Looking at the home schedule, I don’t 
see the Gators losing more than once in The Swamp. If they do drop a home game, I think the Nov. 13 matchup with South Carolina will be the one.
The road schedule is a different story. 
Traveling to Tuscaloosa to play Alabama looks like a loss on paper, but I wouldn’t put it past UF to pull an upset. Not that I’m predicting that to happen. 
Games against Georgia in Jacksonville 
and Florida State in Tallahassee won’t be easy, but I don’t ex-pect Florida to lose more than one of those. 
So, I’ll put the 
team at 10-2, which will be good enough to earn a return trip 
to the SEC Champi-
onship Game and a rematch with Ala-
bama. ‘Bama will send UF home from Atlanta with a loss, landing the Gators in 
the Sugar Bowl for the second consecutive 
season, and giving me another week in New Orleans.
Individually, I like wide receiver 
Omarius Hines, running back Mike Gil-lislee and defensive end Justin Trattou to have breakout years to varying degrees — First Team All-SEC would be a breakout year for Trattou, while a 600-yard season 
would qualify the same for Hines or Gil-
lislee. 
Brantley will be as good as advertised, 
meaning the bulk of the team’s yardage 
comes through the air and not on the 
ground. I don’t see him hoisting a bronze statue at the end of the season, though. 
The previous 350 or so words are just 
one person’s best guess at what to expect 
out of this season, but I will leave you with 
one thing I know for sure: Punter Chas Henry will be better as his position than any other Gator at his respective position. 
The Ray Guy Award seems inevitable.Florida will go 11-3, finishing 2010 with 
a repeat of last year’s SEC Champion-ship Game loss and Sugar Bowl win.
In the words of Vicky Valencourt: 
“That ain’t no guess! That’s what it’s 
gonna be.”
Of course, that’s probably wrong, but 
here’s how I see the season going.
Florida will pummel poor, defense-
less Miami (Ohio) and pull away late in the second half against USF and wonder -
coach Skip Holtz.
Tennessee and Kentucky aren’t good, 
so that should give the Gators time to work out all their position battles and get quarterback John Brantley some experi-ence before The Game in Tuscaloosa. 
Check this out: they’re going to beat 
the Crimson Tide. UF is going to show up big-time for that one while ’Bama comes in after a tough road game at Arkansas. It’ll come down to a few key plays, and 
Florida will make them.
Property damage across the state of 
Alabama will be devastating.
Four more SEC wins later, the 9-0 
Gators are the toast of college football un-til Steve Spurrier and his mighty Game-
cocks show up in The Swamp and ruin everything.
The band Hootie & the Blowfish, 
which formed at USC, will reunite and write a song about it. Spurrier will say something funny after the game.
If you’re keeping score at home, you’ve 
noticed I have UF losing one more regular season game, which 
means…
FSU will beat 
Florida.
I know that 
sounds impossible after what’s hap-
pened in the past few years, but quar -
terback Christian 
Ponder is awesome, 
and it has to happen eventually. Jimbo 
Fisher tricks everyone into thinking he’s a good coach with a huge win in front of the home crowd.
The Gators still get into the SEC Cham-
pionship because South Carolina falls to Auburn and Alabama, but the Tide wins the rematch and UF goes back to the Sug-
ar Bowl.
I do lots of drinking on Bourbon Street 
and sing karaoke at Cats Meow (Tim 
McGraw’s “Something Like That”).
The Sugar Bowl doesn’t really matter, 
but Florida will probably clown some overmatched Big East team.
All in all, I’d consider that a solid sea-
son for a team that lost as many key play-
ers as the Gators did, but I’m sure the idea 
of losing to the ’Noles is vomit-inducing for most of you.
Those are 26 predictions for this year, 
and I personally guarantee two of them 
to be true: UF will beat Miami (Ohio), and 
Spurrier will say something really, really funny.

Coaches want to use freshman Trey Burton all over the field this season. 
He has lined up behind center and at the flexback position in practice.

Gators fans have known for more than a year 
who would start at quarterback in 2010.
But the pecking order after John Brantley was 
murky until Monday, when coach Urban Meyer 
said Tyler Murphy is taking snaps with the sec-ond-team offense while Trey Burton has been used in the wildcat position. Both backups are 
true freshmen.
Florida surprised some fans by offering Mur -
phy a scholarship in January, as the Wethersfield, 
Conn., product was previously committed to Temple, a team in the Mid-American Conference 
with just one winning season since 1991.
Meyer said he thinks Murphy has the potential 
to be a good quarterback but admitted the team 
has a problem with two inexperienced players 
waiting behind Brantley, a problem that would be 
amplified should the starter get injured this sea-son.
“There’s a question about how long [Murphy 
has] been playing quarterback,” Meyer said. “He’s 
got a great arm and he’s a pretty mature kid, but 
he’s just not experienced. This is all new to him.”
Giving Murphy the nod at quarterback was not 
necessarily a slight to Burton, who could be used 
in several positions this season. 
In addition to fielding snaps, Burton has lined 
up at the flexback position and Meyer even hinted 
at making him the lead blocker on kick returns this season.
“He’s a total ball player,” offensive coordina-
tor Steve Addazio said. “He lines up, he’s taking snaps, direct runs… he’s powerful, he’s smart, he’s a really good athlete, he has great hands. I would say that’s been really fun to watch develop 
here over the last five, six days.”
Tight ends coach Brian White added he is im-
pressed with Burton’s ability to adapt to new po-
sitions.
“He’s a really unselfish guy,” White said. “He 
wants to help this football team win in whatev-er role coach Addazio, coach Meyer devise for him.”
Offensive line shakeup: Senior Mike Pouncey 
said there is a good chance he will play tackle ear -
ly this season as Xavier Nixon and Matt Patchan recover from injuries. Pouncey expected to replace his brother, Maurkice, at center this season.
Nixon suffered a left knee injury while Patchan 
is rehabbing from a broken right wrist. The pair was competing for the starting left tackle posi-
tion.
Patchan has returned to practice but was held 
out of contract drills, Meyer said Monday.
If neither player is ready by the season open-
er Sept. 4, Pouncey said he would move to right tackle. Marcus Gilbert, expected to play on the 
right side, would switch to left tackle, and sopho-more Sam Robey would play center.
UF offensive linemen practice multiple posi-
tions in the preseason to accommodate for injured starters once games begin, and Pouncey said he doesn’t  mind switching positions.
“I feel like I’m a great player wherever I play 
at,” he said, “and I just want to win.”Role of backup QBs takes form
