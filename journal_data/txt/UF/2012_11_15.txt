�THE LAST TIME THE 
COUNTY DOCUMENTED THE DISEASE WAS 2003.
SHELBY WEBB
Alligator Staff Writer
The three people in Alach-
ua County infected with the 
mosquito-borne West Nile Virus made full recoveries.
The Alachua County 
Health Department an-nounced Tuesday that three people were being treated for the virus. This was the ﬁ  rst time the county documented anyone with the disease since 2003.The department wouldn’t 
release where the infected individuals live or may have been infected due to patient 
privacy laws.
Paul Myers, a health de-
partment administrator, said 
the disease was detected after three people tried to donate blood early this month. While checking the blood for im-purities, a blood bank found antibodies in the individuals’ 
blood samples that signaled 
the presence of West Nile Vi-rus.
While the blood test to 
conﬁ  rm the diagnosis won’t be ﬁ  nished until next week, Myers said the three individ-County urges

HURRICANE SANDY

Hurricane Sandy slammed states about 
1,000 miles north of Florida, but distance 
isn’t keeping UF students and Hillel staff 
members from getting involved in the 
cleanup.
Two staff members and 45 students 
will cram into a bus for an 18-hour drive 
to help with relief efforts this weekend. 
They’re leaving today for the trip, which is sponsored by UF Hillel in partnership 
with Columbia/Barnard Hillel in New 
York, said Melissa Stern, a UF Hillel staff member.
“The response has been really surpris-
ing and wonderful to hear that the whole school wants to help out,” Stern said, add-ing that there’s a wait list of 12 people.
The group will work Friday and part 
of Saturday with a federation in Staten 
Island, Stern said. They’re bringing clean-
ing kits as well as food, clothing and other necessities collected from drives by Hillel and UF student organizations.
“Ideally, we’re having the entire bottom 
of the bus ﬁ  lled with supplies and dona-tions,” she said.
The trip was open to all students, Stern 
said, and is completely funded by UF Hil-lel donors.
Psychology senior Alyssa Freeman is 
going because she has family in Long Is-land, an area that was badly hit by the storm.
“It’s such a great opportunity that I just 
wasn’t expecting to happen this week,” the 21-year-old said. “I just really would like to do as much as I can to help with relief.”UF students, Hillel staff bus to New York to assist Sandy victimsSEE WEST NILE, PAGE 4

UF’s Graduate Assistants Unit-
ed is ﬁ  ghting to spread awareness 
about the need for an improved contract.
They’re bargaining to end grad-uate assistant fees, provide health 
care like dental and vision insur-
ance and guarantee medical leave 
and child care for their families, ac-
cording to a news release.
Graduate assistants help pro-
fessors while they complete their 
education. They must pay fees to the university, even though their 
workloads increase and their sti-pends remain the same, according to the release. 
GAU co-president Graham 
Picklesimer said the union asked the university last month to in-crease minimum wage for gradu-ate assistants.
Picklesimer 
said the chief ne-
gotiator for UF 
said there was no money in the budget.
“It’s pocket 
change,” he said 
in reference to the wage increase.
A statement from Paula Fussell, vice president for human resource services, stated that university rep-
resentatives continue to meet with 
GAU members to discuss issues 
with the contract.
“As you know, the university 
is experiencing difﬁ  cult budget times but remains committed to open discussions surrounding is-sues important to our graduate Graduate assistants rally to increase wages, improve contracts

� ‘IT’S A SWAMP THANG’ IS ON 
ITUNES.
MICHELLE PROVENZANO
Alligator Contributing Writer
Daryl Brown knows a thing or two 
about being a Gators fan.
Brown, a 34-year-old Gainesville rap-
per known as Deal’a, released his newest 
single, “It’s a Swamp Thang,” on iTunes and Google Play Oct. 2. Brown recorded a remix of the song with Gators defensive tackle Leon Orr Tuesday night.
Brown said he bonded with Orr when 
he cut the Florida player’s hair before foot-ball games.
Orr loved Brown’s song and pushed 
for it to play in the Swamp on gamedays, Brown said.
Sophia Bou-Ghannam, a 19-year-old 
biomedical engineering sophomore, said she’s heard the track a few times during football games.
She said hearing it in the stadium 
pumps up students and gets the Swamp rowdy.
“It’s an accurate portrayal of how crazy 
we get about Florida football,” she said. “The funniest line of the song is ‘Gators eat haters.’”
A music video to boost the song’s hype 
and bring out the pride in Gators fans is in the works, Brown said.
Orr asked Florida head coach Will Mus-
champ if the two could shoot the music video in the Swamp and include the team, Brown said.
He said Muschamp agreed.Brown planned to shoot the music vid-
eo last week, but he postponed it because Orr was sick with the flu.
He said he wants to complete the video 
by spring.
Brown recorded the original song to 
pay tribute to his Gainesville family roots and unite Gators fans.
“My heart lies with the Gator Nation,” 
he said.
Brown was born a Gators fan in 1978 at 
Shands at UF.
“My dad was a UF student,” he said. “I 
grew up always watching Gators games.”
Brown combined his love for Gators 
sports and music as an adult, when he opened his music production company, Big Profit$ Entertainment, last year and wrote “It’s a Swamp Thang.”
He said he got a lot of great feedback 
for the song from the Gainesville commu-nity after promoting it downtown upon its release.
With the remix recorded, Brown said 
he has big plans for the song and plans to make it an anthem for Gators fans.
Merchandise will come soon, he said.He plans to make T-shirts, hats and 
other apparel boasting the song’s lyrics, he said.  
Business aside, Brown said he knew he wanted to make an anthem to unite Gators fans and support the team he loves.
“When we unite, we’re a force to be 
reckoned with,” Brown said.

With just a few clicks, UF stu-
dents can get discounts for places 
around town.
Student Body President Tj Vil-
lamil announced in his State of the 
Campus address that students can 
text “UF” to 96714 to receive deals at Gainesville businesses. Imple-menting a mobile deal program was on Villamil’s platform when he ran for office in Spring 2012.
After signing up, students will 
receive the first offer: a free combo upgrade with the purchase of a pita from Pita Pit or double tasty burger from Relish.
Mark Highbaugh, CEO of Mar -
limar, the interactive mobile strate-
gies company running the program, 
said My University Mobile was cre-ated about two years ago. It was im-plemented at 14 other universities, including University of Kentucky and Virginia Tech, Highbaugh said.
So far, Pita Pit and Relish are 
the only places offering deals, but Highbaugh said other merchants 
are interested.
As of Wednesday morning, 
about 500 people were signed up for 
My UF Mobile, Highbaugh said.He said the company turned 
down merchants whose deals weren’t in the consumers’ best in-terests. When Marlimar looks for 
a company , they 
look for high value, relevance to students and timeliness, High-baugh said.
Based on 
the company’s studies at other 
universities, stu-
dents tend to not opt out if they get 
up to three offers a day and up to 10 a week. The deals usually last be-tween two to three days.
“It’s the best window that causes 
students to act on it,” Highbaugh said.
Villamil said it’s great because 
it’s free to all students. Standard text messaging rates apply , but there are no additional costs.
In fact, students can raise money 
for UF. Marlimar works with the companies and shares a portion with the university.
“Just by you participating, you 
are helping raise revenue,” High-baugh said.
Villamil said the amount of mon-
ey UF receives depends on how many users sign up. He said that based on the estimates he received, if all 50,000 UF students sign up, UF could receive $100,000 a year.
Villamil said the university 
hasn’t decided where the money will go.
Not only does My UF Mobile 
benefit students, Villamil said, but it also allows them to try different local venues.
“That’s the only reason why I 
did it,” he said. “The students are 
the winners.”

Trader Joe’s is now accepting applications at the Butler Plaza 
Shopping Center near Picture This! 
� THIS IS THE SECOND TRADER 
JOE’S IN FLORIDA.
MICHAEL SCOTT DAVIDSON
Alligator Writer
The Hawaiian shirt-wearing employ-
ees of Trader Joe’s will greet Gainesville 
residents at the end of the semester.
Trader Joe’s announced this week 
that the new Gainesville store will open Dec. 12.
The Gainesville location will be the 
second Trader Joe’s in Florida, accord-ing to the company’s website. The Cal-ifornia-based company has more than 350 stores nationwide.
The building is under construction 
in a portion of the former Goody’s, 3728 Archer Road. According to Alligator ar -
chives, the store signed a 10-year lease agreement for a Butler Plaza space in 
May.
The store began accepting job ap-
plications Nov. 7. Applications can be 
printed from www.traderjoes.com.
The grocery store features an array 
of domestic and imported foods and beverages including specialities such as Speculoos Cookie Butter and basic groceries such as eggs and milk. There 
are about 2,000 items under Trader Joe’s 
private label, which is about 80 percent of the store’s inventory, according to a news release.
Contact Michael Scott Davidson at 
mdavidson@alligator.org.Trader Joe’s set to open on Dec. 12 
uals complained about West Nile symptoms after finding out 
they may have the disease.
Myers said he and his colleagues aren’t surprised by the new 
West Nile infections.
“I wouldn’t be surprised if more cases began to pop up,” he 
said.
After Tropical Storm Debby , he said, there was a noticeable 
spike in mosquito populations, particularly the type that spread West Nile Virus.
In the weeks and months after the storm, a few cases of the 
virus were found in county chickens and a horse.
Most of the virus’ symptoms are similar to those associated 
with the flu — headache, fever, stiff muscles and an occasional rash. But Myers said 80 percent of people infected show no 
symptoms, while about one in 150 shows signs of a more ag-
gressive form of the disease that can attack the neurological system.
The best ways to prevent infection with the virus are to wear 
clothing that covers most of your body and insect repellent.
“Don’t go out at dusk or dawn,” Myers said. “That’s when 
they’re looking for blood.”
Some UF students said they were stunned the disease was 
found in the county.
Danielle Cotillo, 20-year-old public relations sophomore, 
said her friends spoke about being warned of the disease while studying abroad.
She said she didn’t think she would have to worry about it 
in the U.S.
“There aren’t really that many mosquitos in Gainesville,” 
the St. Petersburg native said. “I never really thought about it.”

Wednesday night. The performance represents anger and conformity.
students,” the statement read.
Also, many graduate assistants do not re-
ceive family medical leave, Picklesimer said. 
Family medical leave only applies for gradu-ate assistants who work 1,250 hours or more 
a year. However, graduate assistants’ hours 
have been cut, sometimes down to 1,000 hours 
a year, hindering them from receiving benefits, 
he said.
Sarah Taber, 29, said she makes less money 
now than she did as a doctoral student.
Taber found out she was pregnant shortly 
after starting her assistantship at UF about four years ago. She said there is a three- to six- month window during which new mothers of-ten need family medical leave, but it was not provided to her.
“I’ve had a couple female colleagues drop 
out,” she said.
GAU co-president José Soto said some 
graduate assistants make below the poverty level for wages, which is $11,170 for a house-
hold of one, according to the U.S. Department 
of Health and Human Services Poverty Guide-lines.
“We are not here to demand anything that 
is unrealistic,” Soto said. “We [can] conserve 
The Gator Nation with better health care. We 
can provide that, but we need the bargaining contract to come through.”FEES , from page 1Some GAs paid below poverty level
Many residents are in recovery mode
Brian Cohen, executive director of Columbia/
Barnard Hillel, described post-storm New York 
as a different world. 
Many New Yorkers resumed their normal 
lives, he said, but many others, especially on the coasts of New York and New Jersey, are still in recovery mode.
There is an immediate need for volunteers, 
which UF Hillel is fulfilling, he said.
“A lot of campuses called from around the 
country and expressed a desire and willingness to help over winter or Spring Break,” he said. “UF Hillel said, ‘We want to come next week.’ It’s amazing.”
The Columbia/Barnard Hillel will find hous-
ing for the visiting students Friday night via Columbia and New York University student net-works. 
They’ll also continue the relief efforts Sunday 
after the UF group leaves.
“Everyone who’s up here is incredibly grate-
ful for this effort and leadership that UF students are showing,” Cohen said. “They’re going to be 
impacting a whole bunch of lives in the two days 
they’re up here.”

41% NOWednesday’s question: Have you bought 
gas recently? Today’s question: Do you think you pay too many
student fees?It’s about time to say ta-ta to ‘Twilight’
This is it.
For years, people across the globe have waited for 
tonight. Hearts will be broken and tears will be shed.
At 10 p.m., a new era will begin as vampires and were-
wolves take the big screen for the ﬁ  nal time when “Twilight 
Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 2”  enters theaters.
Many fans have had this day marked on their calendars 
for months as the world’s best vampire couple will show off its new baby.
The “Twilight” craze may be a little outdated, though.
The ﬁ  rst book reached its height of popularity in 2005 
when it was released. Even the last book, “Breaking Dawn,” 
was published four years ago, making it about time for the movie series to catch up.
A lot changed since 2008. The series’ original fans are no 
longer preteens, which raises the question: How many loy-al fans will pay the overpriced movie theater fee to see the blockbuster, and how many will wait in line for the premiere of the ﬁ  fth “Twilight” movie to appear on the big screen? 
In Los Angeles, people pitched tents to wait all week. The 
enthusiasm may not be quite as high in Gainesville.
Younger generations know nothing of the thrilling books 
that ﬁ  rst grabbed fans’ attentions. The “Twilight” series thrived in a time when people were depressed about the ﬁ  nal 
“Harry Potter” release. Middle schoolers now know “Twi-
light” as a movie series rather than the romance novels that made the name famous.
Even more than books, “Twilight” became a cultural revo-
lution several years ago.
Twi-hards were a large following that proudly proclaimed 
“Team Edward” or “Team Jacob.” Years ago, I even splurged to buy a T-shirt that had my favorite vampire’s face on it with my babysitting money. “Twilight” had a cult-like following 
that people seemed to latch on to. But as trends come and go, 
so has the age of “Twilight.”
The band of followers has shrank for some time. As the 
books become a faint memory and people watch the ﬁ  rst movies again, they remember only the terrible acting instead of the clenching plot they original-ly fell in love with.
What each book added to the 
exciting lives of Bella Swan and Edward Cullen, the movies sucked the life out of.
Last year, the fourth movie in 
the “Twilight” series hit theaters on Nov. 17. The ﬁ  nal book, “Break-ing Dawn,” was divided into two 
movies. The 10 p.m. release of part two marks the end of a series many people followed since the beginning, and once people invest themselves in something, they will more than likely see it ﬁ  nished.
There has always been a fascination with the unknown.“Twilight” brought vampires and werewolves to light 
and fashioned them into real people. They weren’t just Hal-loween costumes, and it made vampires into something more than Count Dracula. Stephenie Meyer,  the author of 
the “Twilight” series, took her audience into a new realm of 
imagination.
But sadly , the movies have failed to catch the magic that 
lived between the pages of the books.
The ﬁ  rst movie, which premiered in 2008, gave obsessed 
fans what they wanted: a real Cullen family and pack of werewolves to admire.
But underneath the fake sparkly skin, those who had no 
interest in the books found even less thrill in the movies. Bel-
la’s quiet demeanor that the books suggest took a wrong turn 
into Kristen Stewart’s coldness.
Regardless of the years that passed, many fans still re-
member the weeks they could not put a “Twilight” book down or eagerly anticipated the arrival of the next one.
These memories alone will bring many former fans, in-
cluding myself, to see the culmination of the best vampire love story there ever was.

Guy’s American Kitchen & Bar seats 500 people, but it doesn’t 
appear to serve edible food.
“The well-meaning staff seems to realize that this is not a real 
restaurant,” Wells wrote.
That line comes at the end of his two-page review, which he 
wrote almost entirely in questions.
“Guy Fieri, have you eaten at your new restaurant in Times 
Square?” Wells asked to begin his review. “Have you pulled up one of the 500 seats at Guy’s American Kitchen & Bar and or-dered a meal? Did it live up to your expectations?”
“Did panic grip your soul as you stared into the whirling 
hypno wheel of the menu, where adjectives and nouns spin in a crazy vortex?” he continued. “When you saw the burger de-scribed as ‘Guy’s Pat LaFrieda custom blend, all-natural Creek-stone Farm Black Angus beef patty , LTOP (lettuce, tomato, onion + pickle), SMC (super-melty-cheese) and a slathering of Donkey Sauce on garlic-buttered brioche,’ did your mind touch the void for a minute?”
A lot of people talked about this review since it was published 
on Tuesday. Why give so much attention to one food review? 
Wells is well-known for nearly burning down establishments 
with his words, though he doesn’t always attack them with the vinegary bite of this review titled “As Not Seen on TV .”
Three words: This is awesome. For too long, America has been under the guise of Fieri, with 
his insipid shows on Food Network and his ill-begotten hosting gig on “Minute to Win It.”
“When you hung that sign by the entrance that says, WEL-
COME TO FLAVOR TOWN!, were you just messing with our heads?,” Wells said.
Yes, Wells, let the hatred feed your anger. It’s about time we 
all came to grips with who Fieri truly is: a person probably in it only for the money. It seems like Fieri unapologetically created a persona strictly to swindle money from people. We’re taught these days, that we need to have a personal brand. 
Does Wells’ review seem unfair or overly harsh to you? May-
be he just visited on an off night or something.
“How did nachos, one of the hardest dishes in the American 
canon to mess up, turn out so deeply unlovable?,” Wells said. 
Whoops. Guess they also messed up nachos, which we can 
make in our own microwaves with very little hassle.
“What accounts for the vast difference between the Donkey 
Sauce recipe you’ve published and the Donkey Sauce in your restaurant? Why has the hearty , rustic appeal of roasted-garlic mayonnaise been replaced by something that tastes like Miracle Whip with minced raw garlic? And when we hear the words 
Donkey Sauce, which part of the donkey are we supposed to 
think about?” 
Exactly, Wells. We couldn’t have said it better ourselves. Be-
cause Fieri is an ass, and now we all know so.

� THE EVENT HAD 36 CHOC-
OLATE ICE CREAM FLAVORS.
RACHEL KURLAND
Avenue Contributing Writer
Willy Wonka and his choco-
late factory could not compare to 
the real-life chocolate overload 
of Sweet Dreams’ Fall Chocolate 
Night 2012.
Sweet Dreams created a “world 
of pure imagination” from 1 p.m. 
to 10 p.m. Sunday.
Dark Chocolate Pomegranate, 
White Chocolate Salty Apple and 
Chocolate Maple Bacon Pecan were just a few of the chocolate 
varieties offered out of 36 fresh 
ice cream flavors, which included vegan and sugar-free options.
Michael Manfredi, owner of 
Sweet Dreams, 3437 W. Universi-ty Ave., said he hosts a chocolate night event twice a year. Sunday marked the shop’s 14th chocolate night.
He said he hosts chocolate 
night to create community buzz about his business and “to show off how good we are at making ice cream.”
Manfredi advertised the event 
through Sweet Dreams’ Facebook page and word of mouth. Based on the line outside the front door, that’s the only advertising he needed.  
Manfredi said his ice cream 
shop is the only place in Gainesville that makes its ice cream from scratch.
Manfredi credited Lisa Man-
fredi, Sweet Dreams co-owner, 
for her original chocolate flavors, 
which she reinvents for every chocolate night.
“You’ll never see the same as-
sortment two years in a row,” he said.
So, why chocolate? Michael 
Manfredi said there is an intrigue about it — chocolate is very versa-tile and well-liked.
“I don’t think you could do this 
with any other flavor,” he said.
Salty Caramel Chocolate was 
one of the bestsellers of the night, Michael Manfredi said. It sold out near the final hours of the event, 
along with other delectable fla-
vors such as Jack’s Marshmallow Martian, Brownie Batter Fudge and White Chocolate Russian, which is infused with vodka.
Michael Manfredi also offered a 
mystery flavor. Whoever guessed correctly won a Sweet Dreams gift 
certificate.
Michael Manfredi, a chocolate 
lover, thought of one beloved fla-
vor without hesitation.
“The house chocolate is my fa-
vorite flavor any day of the week,” he said.Kelly Hicks, 34, attended choc-
olate nights at Sweet Dreams for several years.
She said what brings her back 
every time is the quality of the ice 
cream. It is homemade and has 
better ingredients, which makes it 
taste better, she said.
“There are flavors that you can’t 
get anywhere else,” she said.
Hicks said her favorite flavor 
of the night was Coco Monkey, 
which included bananas, peanut butter and, of course, chocolate.
While some customers could 
easily choose a favorite flavor, Stephanie Ley could not.
Ley, 23, bought six different-
flavored scoops, because she 
could not pick just one.
She said the business uses real 
ingredients from Gainesville.
“I just had a fig in my ice 
cream,” Ley said, “and I feel like 
you can’t get that in a lot of plac-es.”
Ley frequented Sweet Dreams 
for the past four years. The recent 
UF alumna went to two chocolate 
nights during that time.
Usually, her favorite flavor 
involves natural ingredients like honey and lavender. At the fall Chocolate Night, she was unde-cided.
“I don’t know which one I just 
ate, but it was good,” she said.Chocolate night satisfies the sweet toothTHURSDAY, NOVEMBER 15, 2012

Infidelity, surgery and a 
bad bunch of raccoons — 
these are three very differ -
ent problems, but somehow interwoven dilemmas in “The Details,” a quirky dark comedy that will play at the 
Hippodrome State Theatre 
starting Friday.
Tobey Maguire (best 
known for his role as Peter Parker in the “Spider-Man” 
films) leads the cast as doc-
tor/family man Jeff Lang, whose life seems to fracture as the nighttime raid of wild 
raccoons tears apart his sod-
den lawn. 
The more Jeff tries to 
take care of the infestation, the more his wife, Nealy 
(Elizabeth Banks), becomes 
aggravated, leaving Jeff un-satisfied both physically and mentally.
One thing leads to anoth-
er, and soon Jeff’s fidelity is compromised not once, but twice. 
Between his best friend 
(Kerry Washington) and his kooky neighbor (Laura Lin-ney, in a hair-brained but enjoyable performance), his 
secrets start to add up. 
The only saving grace is 
his friendship with Lincoln 
(Dennis Haysbert, widely recognized as the guy from 
the “Allstate” commercials), 
a confidant with health issues that prompt Jeff to perform his only act of good charity, 
giving his own kidney.
Despite Jeff’s good inten-
tions, his lies add up, becom-
ing more and more ridicu-lous and intertwined as the 
movie spans. 
This premise may seem cliche, but Maguire’s inher -
ent realness, grounded in 
exhausted expressions and perpetual lack of explanation 
for anything that happens to 
him makes the tired plot a bit more exciting. 
Plus, the secrets them-
selves, from dead cats to 
secret pregnancies, are ridic-
ulous yet completely intrigu-ing.
The plot seems, at points, 
a bit too wacky, but it is nev-
er over -
whelm-ing to the point of 
boredom. 
R a t h e r , it centers 
a r o u n d 
the humor 
of the overall situation. 
In fact, one of the final 
scenes between Banks and 
Maguire, in which every-
thing is explained, Banks 
doubles over in disbelieving laughter — a mirror of my own reactions throughout 
the movie — as if to question 
such numerous circumstanc-es at one time.
On the outside, the movie 
seems like the typical do-
mesticated indie film, but the 
intrigue of the ensemble cast somehow makes it work. 
I would never picture this 
cast of actors interacting with each other, but they all seem to inhabit the characters. Lin-ney, in particular, shucked her more serious side and 
was easily the most unrecog-
nizable as the neurotic flower child gone wrong, Lila.
“The Details” will be 
playing  at the Hippodrome through Nov. 21. For more information and showtimes, visit www.thehipp.org.Details on ‘The

Tyler wants the best of both 
worlds. In college, he spends his 
time trying to balance two sides of himself:  his fraternity side and his gay side.
“Bro-ing Pains,” a comedic 
Web series produced by UF stu-dents, explores the friendship be-tween a gay man surrounded by straight men in a fraternity.
“Aside from the shows ‘Part-
ners’ and ‘Happy Endings,’ there’s not a lot of shows that look at the relationships between gay men and straight men and how they can have a friendship,” said Jonothon Mitchell, a 26-year-old multimedia telecommunication graduate student.
Mitchell is the writer and cre-
ator of “Bro-ing Pains.” He also 
plays the main character, Tyler, a 
man in a fraternity open about his sexual orientation.
Mitchell said he can relate to 
Tyler’s desire to belong and to be accepted in a world that normally isn’t very accepting.
“The overlying theme of the 
whole series is the idea of accep-
tance and knowing where you belong and who you fit in with,” 
he said.
Ansley Gordon, a 20-year-
old public rela-tions and theatre junior, plays Heather.
Gordon said 
her character says what every girl thinks but can’t say. Her no-
filter attitude makes her a charac-ter almost everyone can relate to.
Trenor Wilkins, a 20-year-old 
telecommunication junior, is the 
assistant director in charge of the sound for the series.
Wilkins said the series explores 
stereotypes and breaks them.
Because the actors and produc-
ers involved in “Bro-ing Pains” 
are students, production depends on their schedules.
Gordon admits it can be diffi-
cult to juggle academics and act-ing.
“When I look back on college, 
I’ll think of what I accomplished, not how tired I was,” she said.
Skyler Kern, a 23-year-old tele-
communication senior, is the di-rector of the Web series.
“What makes it worthwhile is when I’m sitting at work at 2 a.m., and I have someone who I don’t even know come up to me and say ‘I love ‘Bro-ing Pains,’” Kern said.
Mitchell said there will not be a 
second season to the Web series.
“I want everyone to end ex-
actly where they’re supposed to end,” he said. “I want everyone to end on a high note.”

The crowd at Cafe C will raise its 
glasses to a good cause tonight.
Florida Organic Growers is host-
ing a beer and wine tasting fund-
raiser from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. at Cafe 
C.Tickets are $25 online at www.

Florida Or -
ganic Growers hopes to host its beer and wine tasting at Cafe C annually , Maxx said.
At the event, attendees can sam-
ple organic and nonorganic beers and wines donated by Swamp Head Beer Brewery and Tangled Oaks Vineyard.
Two beer and wine experts will 
lead the tasting. Maxx expects about 100 people to attend.“It is a very Gainesville-centered

office manager of Florida Organic 
Growers. “It is going to be an en-joyable time for people who are at-tending, and hopefully we can raise support for an organization that does important work for the com-munity.”THURSDAY , NOVEMBER 15, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 9

Dear Friend,
Thank you for, first, clarifying that you are not a pedo-
phile. Hundreds of years ago, there was only one way to settle things between men. I’m sure it went like this: Two barbaric dudes sat down, and they arm wrestled until there was a winner. If you won, you got to date his not-that-young sister, openly talk about your first sexual encounter with her, and your friend wasn’t allowed to punch you in the balls. If he won, you didn’t get to court his sister, and you had to give up your best goat. We can be thankful that humans have reached the point where communication solves problems. Tell your buddy you dig his sister, and you want to make sure it’s cool with him first. This will show you care about your friendship with 
him, and you aren’t just thinking with your d--k.Dear Friend,
I have a feeling I would be incred-ibly bored. I wouldn’t masturbate, because that would be done in like one minute. Multiple orgasms are one of the top reasons it’s great to be a woman. I would probably run to feel what it’s like to jog without boobs. Unless you have the ultimate sports bra, half of the exercise is worrying about who is looking at your breasts. As a man, I’d just run shirtless all day to feel free. If for some reason I ended up having man-boobs in this hypo-thetical situation, I would call it a day 
and catch up on some TV. Dear Mediocre Advice,
If you were a man for a day, what 
would you do?
Dear Friend,
There’s no secret, but you may be too self-conscious about this. I think a lot of girls who look great with red lipstick overthink it and are convinced they can’t pull it off. Don’t feel stupid. Put on that lipstick, go out and see what happens. At least one person will compliment you on it, or at least one drunk guy will say something borderline offensive — surprisingly, a good sign. If you still don’t feel that it works for you, at least you can surely say it’s not your thing.Dear Mediocre Advice,
I love the red lipstick look, but whenever I try it, I feel like I look stupid and usu -
ally end up wiping it off. Is there a secret to it, or are some people just doomed to 
not pull it off?Dear Mediocre Advice,
I have a friend who has a cute younger sister (not way-young, just younger than I am) who is into me. I don’t think it is a good idea to hook up because of my friend, but I definitely want to explore it further. How can I go about it without risking my friendship with 
him?

By its name alone, the classic rock genre is 
seen as a musical era valued in retrospect — a 
finite period of time when musical innovators left their marks on rock ‘n’ roll history.
While many bands were content to just 
leave their marks, there are some who aspire to remain a part of it. Case in point: Columbia Records acts and musical legends Aerosmith and AC/DC. 
On Nov . 6, Aerosmith released “Music 
From Another Dimension,” its first album in 11 years. AC/DC will release “Live At River Plate,” the band’s first live album in 20 years, Monday.
Aerosmith’s latest offering includes the 
Boston quintet’s trademark blend of bluesy swagger, dance-heavy grooves and hard rock thrash that is evident on album opener “LUV XXX.”
The album received mixed reviews from 
critics and garnered a 53 out of 100 score on Metacritic.
According to AC/DC’s official website, 
“Live At River Plate” was recorded at the band’s performance in December 2009 in Bue-nos Aires. The DVD version of the concert was released in May 2011 and documented the three sold-out performances in front of 200,000 fans. It was the band’s first show in Argentina in 13 years.
The website also said the Black Ice World 
Tour earned it a Pollstar award for Major Tour of the Year in 2010.
These two hard rock icons aren’t the only 
classic rock ‘n’ roll bands that have resurfaced after years of dormancy. Van Halen returned 
to the studio for its February 2012 release of “A Different 
Kind of Truth.”
Aerosmith and AC/DC 
are members of a move-
ment — a movement in-cluding rock stars of yore attempting to stay relevant 
decades after their supposed prime. Perhaps the epitome of trend lies in the enduring rock ‘n’ roll spirit of British invasion vanguards 
the Rolling Stones. According to an article in The Telegraph, the band will kick off its 50th 
anniversary tour Nov. 25 at the O2 Arena in London.
While it is too easy to write off these bands 
as a bunch of old men trying to relive their glory years, it is important to recognize the impact their presence has on fans of this gen-eration and others.
According to Billboard’s official website, 
AC/DC’s 2008 release “Black Ice” attained the top spot on the Billboard 200, Rock Albums and Hard Rock Albums charts.
While fans can only speculate what moti-
vates these bands to continue, one thing is for sure: Their music is still relevant to listeners. In spite of the rock ‘n’ roll ethics accusations voiced by fans and critics, one cannot deny that these bands still have large, devoted audi-
ences committed to supporting their music.
Aerosmith and AC/DC release new albums this month
Classic rock is still relevant

Lindsey McKnight’s transition to college swimming 
has been eased by the presence of her sister, Taylor. Read the story on alligatorSports.org. Florida hoops team makes signings ofﬁ  cial
Forward Chris Walker and guard Kasey Hill ofﬁ  cially signed national letters of intent with Florida on Wednesday. Walker and Hill are the No. 8 and No. 9 overall recruits nationally, according to Rivals. Ronni Williams became the best recruit in Florida women’s basketball history when she signed on Wednesday. See story, page 16. 
  LANDON WATNICK
 Alligator Writer
 
  After missing Monday’s practice with a mi-
graine that caused bouts of vomiting, Erik Mur-
phy did it all against Wisconsin on Wednesday 
night.
  The senior forward had a perfect shooting 
night, tying his career high with 24 points as 
the No. 10 Gators (2-0) surged past the No. 
22 Badgers (1-1) during a 74-56 victory in the 
O’Connell Center.
  “It was just our night from the ﬁ  rst half,” 
Murphy said. 
“We were hitting shots. There’s nothing else 
to say.”
  The 6-foot-10 senior’s 10-for-10 clip helped 
Florida nail 61.9 percent of its ﬁ  eld goal at-
tempts. 
The Gators scored 43 points on 75 percent 
shooting in the ﬁ  rst half and led wire to wire.   
  Murphy grabbed eight boards, including 
four on the offensive end. 
He also notched a block and a steal. 
  “Mr. Versatility is what you should call 
him,” junior Patric Young said. 
“He knocked down threes. He knocked 
down pull-ups. He was in the post making moves. He was getting offensive rebounds. I’ve known he’s been able to play like that for a long time.”
Murphy became the fourth player in Florida 
history to hit all of his ﬁ  eld goal attempts while taking 10 or more shots in a game.
After taking 51.9 percent of his shots from 
beyond the arc last season, Murphy took eight of his 10 shots against Wisconsin from two-point range.
Dating back to last season, Murphy has 
pulled down eight or more rebounds in four of 
his past ﬁ  ve games. He recorded eight or more 
rebounds only four times in 97 career games before the current stretch. 
  Florida committed 20 turnovers on Wednes-
day but compensated with advantages in re-
bounding (40-21) and points in the paint (32-
18). 
  “To score 74 points against this team, with 
the way they are defensively, and turn the ball over 20 times is unheard of,” coach Billy Dono-van said. 
“I just told the guys to keep moving the 
ball, moving bodies and keeping passing so we could move them around. When we did that, we were effective.”
  Redshirt senior guard Mike Rosario record-
ed 15 points and four rebounds. 
Senior guard Kenny Boynton scored 10 
points but went 1 for 5 on three-pointers. The duo combined for seven assists and seven turnovers.

  A rush of emotions will hit senior 
left tackle Xavier Nixon when he and 
UF’s 18 other seniors run out of the 
tunnel in The Swamp for the last time 
on Saturday, but they may not be the only ones. 
  Nixon is looking forward to his 
last hoorah and sees a door opening to a possible professional career, and the NFL may come calling for Flori-da’s draft-eligible juniors, as well. 
  While the seniors will have their 
day on Saturday, a number of juniors on Florida’s roster could be the ﬁ  rst to hear their names called at the NFL Draft in April. 
  Junior defensive lineman Sharrif Floyd headlines a potential Gators 
draft class that could be the largest 
since 2010, when the team had nine players selected.
  “We are pleased with where 
[Floyd] is heading, and he is working 
really hard at his skills to keep im-
proving throughout the year,” defen-
sive coordina-tor Dan Quinn 
said. “He and 
a number of 
other guys are showing that they are getting better and better as the sea-son is going on.”
  Draft analyst Mel Kiper Jr. project-
ed Floyd as a ﬁ  rst-round pick.
  Before last season, when UF pro-
duced only fourth-round pick Jaye  UF has pro-ready juniorsFIRE JOE MORGAN
  When it comes to eliminating yellow 
ﬂ  ags, coach Will Muschamp might as well wave a white one. The 
Gators have a penalty problem, and it’s not going away any time soon.
  Florida was called for 100 penalties in 
2011, the seventh-highest mark in the nation. Through 10 games in 2012, the Gators are on pace to eclipse the century mark. Florida’s 66.1 average penalty yardage per game is 6.6 yards more than last year’s mark. 
  “We’ve talked about it, we’re going to re-
emphasize it again,” Muschamp said on Sat-urday of Florida’s penalty predicament. “We have emphasized it every day in every situa-tion we could. We’ve benched guys. … We’ve done everything we can do. We’re going to ﬁ  nd another way.”
  While Muschamp’s commitment to eradi-cating the Gators’ penalty woes is ad-mirable, his efforts are ultimately futile. 
  Florida is an un-
disciplined football team, and nothing anybody can do will ﬁ  x the problem im-
mediately. Penalties have been a problem since Game 1 of Muschamp’s tenure, and there are no substantial signs of improvement.
  Learning to play football responsibly with-
in the rules is apparently a gradual process for the Gators.
  Fifty-seven of Florida’s 79 penalties — 72.2 
percent — are undisciplined penalties, which  Undisciplined penalties still 
proving costly for Gators

UF centerare ﬂ  ags earned for just being stupid. Offsides, false 
starts, delays of game, substitution infractions, too many men on the ﬁ  eld, late hits, facemasks, chop blocks and roughing kickers, passers and punters all qualify.
  With the possible exception of delay of game, no 
undisciplined penalties this late in the season are the fault of the coaching staff.
  Don’t move until the ball is snapped, and stop 
when the whistle blows.
  If you are on scholarship at a Southeastern Con-
ference university to play football, the assumption is that you understand the basic rules of football.
  Despite the towering pile of yellow ﬂ  ags that 
likely haunts Muschamp’s dreams, the Gators are 9-1 and will ﬁ  nish the season as SEC East co-cham-pions.
  “There’s absolutely zero evidence to support that 
you can’t win a championship and be a penalized football team,” Muschamp said on Aug. 6.
  Well, congratulations, Florida. You won a cham-
pionship, sort of.
  And hey, the Gators still have an outside shot 
of sneaking into the BCS National Championship Game in Miami on Jan. 7.
  But if Florida didn’t have such a large issue with 
penalties, Muschamp’s squad would be sitting pret-ty as the No. 1 team in the country right now.
  Imagine if UF didn’t commit 10 penalties, seven 
of which were undisciplined, in its loss to Georgia. What if the Gators had not recorded more penalty yards (95) than rushing yards (75)? Perhaps Florida could have done without two separate false starts on third down.
  Maybe two ﬁ  rst-down personnel errors — 12 
men on the ﬁ  eld and a substitution infraction — were the straws that broke Florida’s back.
  Amazingly, despite numerous dumb penalties 
and six (!) turnovers against the Bulldogs, the Gators were still one Jordan Reed fumble away from over-time.
  Florida will complete this season with double-
digit victories for the ﬁ  rst time since 2009. The Gators have improved drastically in 2012, and they should be extremely proud of the strides they have made since a brutal 2011 campaign. 
  But as long as Florida struggles with undisci-
plined penalties — one of the basic fundamentals of football — continued growth will be difﬁ  cult.

Defensive tackle Sharrif Floyd tackles Louisiana running back 
Alonzo Harris in UF’s 27-20 win on Saturday in The Swamp. 
JOE , from page 14Defensive tackle projected as ﬁ  rst-rounder
Howard and ﬁ  fth-round selection 
Chris Rainey, a Florida player had been selected in the ﬁ  rst round for 
ﬁ  ve straight years. 
  Kiper said Floyd, junior safety 
Matt Elam and junior tight end Jor-
dan Reed are Florida’s best draft 
prospects.
  Floyd leads the Gators with 10 
tackles for loss. 
Kiper said Floyd’s ability to ﬁ  t  
multiple defensive schemes is a 
valuable asset for NFL teams. 
Elam is tied for the team lead 
with three interceptions, and Reed 
tops all Gators pass catchers in re-
ceptions and yards.
  Floyd entered headlines on 
Tuesday afternoon when a USA To-
day article revealed lavish beneﬁ  ts 
given to Floyd by his adopted fa-ther, Kevin Lahn, which exposed a loophole within NCAA rules.  The NCAA suspended Floyd for 
two games last season for receiving 
impermissible beneﬁ  ts from Lahn, 
who had not yet adopted him.
  “I knew everything,” coach Will 
Muschamp said. “Absolutely not 
ever worried about any eligibility 
issues. Sharrif is a 
ﬁ  ne young man.”
  Muschamp has 
been pleased with 
the character of 
Elam, a Jim Thor-pe Award semiﬁ  -nalist safety, who 
has helped young-
er defensive backs like sophomore 
Loucheiz Purifoy develop into playmakers.
  Kiper rated Elam as his top 
strong safety. 
CBSSports.com has Elam as its 
34th-ranked player overall.
  Quinn said Elam has become a 
more explosive tackler as his career has progressed. Quinn struggles to imagine the defense without the 
safety next year. 
  “Hopefully I’m not having that 
discussion,” Quinn said. “I don’t 
think I will, but he brings a lot to 
us in terms of toughness and ﬁ  nish-
ing.”
  Florida’s coaching staff has built 
the team into a stronger unit this season, which the players feel has 
prepared them for professional 
football. 
As a group, the staff has 33 years 
of NFL experience.
  “All of them played in the NFL 
and coached in the NFL,” senior linebacker Jon Bostic said. “It helps us out a lot from our standpoint of them being able to let us know this 
is what it takes to get to the next 
level and these are the things you need to work on.”

Down two key players, UF defense shines
  “The thing I was most proud about with our guys 
[Wednesday night] is we turned it over too much, and I 
probably kept Boynton … and Rosario on the ﬂ  oor too long,” Donovan said. 
“Those guys really fought through for not having a nor-
mal rotation.”
  The Gators once again played without two of their best 
defenders — juniors Scottie Wilbekin (suspension) and Casey 
Prather (concussion) — but held the Badgers to 35.6-percent 
shooting. 
UF disrupted Wisconsin coach Bo Ryan’s Princeton-style 
offense by changing its coverages and pacing. 
  “I felt that it would be important to not let them get into 
any kind of ﬂ  ow,” Donovan said. 
“(We were) just trying to keep them off balance a little bit.”
  Florida opened the game on a 9-0 run in the ﬁ  rst ﬁ  ve min-
utes of play. 
Wisconsin cut UF’s lead to two points with 9:26 remaining 
in the ﬁ  rst half, but the Gators responded with an 11-3 run. 
  Florida led Wisconsin by 12 points at halftime and built 
its lead to 17 with 16:09 remaining in the sec-
ond half. 
  After that point, 
Florida continued to ride Murphy as it dominated the re-
mainder of the contest. 
  “It just shows how much [Murphy has] committed,” Ro-
sario said. 
“With that little cold or whatever was going on with him, 
he just put that to the side and he knew that he had to step up his game.” HOOPS , from page 14

After opening the season with a 
pair of home victories by double-
digit margins, Florida goes on the 
road to face a familiar rival for its 
first true test of the season.
Florida (2-0) travels to Tallahas-
see to face Florida State (1-0) tonight 
at 7 in the Donald L. Tucker Center.
The meeting will be the 69th be-
tween the two teams — the most 
matchups UF has played against any opponent. 
But it will be the first chance for 
coach Amanda Butler to see how her team — particularly the freshmen — reacts to a hostile environment. 
“This will be a really unique ex-
perience for our freshmen,” Butler said. “Not just to play a real game on the road but to play in that en-vironment with the intensity and 
pressure the rivalry brings.”
Florida was just 3-7 in true road 
games last season. Its first matchup 
outside of Gainesville this season 
will feature contrasting styles. 
A veteran Florida State team will 
look to expose the Florida fresh-
men. 
Butler said her team’s ability to 
overcome its inexperience will be critical. 
“We’ve got to go in there and 
really grow up in a hurry,” Butler said. “We can’t let a more experi-enced team against our less experi-enced team be a factor.”In Butler’s five years at Florida, 
success against Florida State has been a litmus test for the rest of the 
season.
Butler has won just twice in five 
tries against the Seminoles. The vic-
tories came in the 2008-09 and 2011-
12 seasons, the two years Florida 
made the NCAA Tournament under Butler. 
“This game has been a game that 
has either made or broke our sea-
son,” assistant coach David Lowery 
said. “It has been the difference be-tween an NCAA Tournament bid and going to the WNIT.”
The intrastate rivalry is extra 
motivation for junior Jaterra Bonds. Bonds grew up in Gainesville and has seen the rivalry develop.
“It’s always that hatred toward 
a rival team,” Bonds said. “You al-ways want to be queen (of your state).”
Recent history suggests a tight 
contest should be expected, as the past five games have been decided by an average margin of 7.6 points. 
Florida lost a back-and-forth 
game 74-72 when it last visited Tal-
lahassee in 2010 before winning an 
emotional game 72-58 at home last season.
Senior Jennifer George said she 
anticipates another battle. 
“With how we beat them last 
year, they are going to come out and have a lot of fans there,” George said. “It’s always a huge game be-
tween us, and I don’t expect any-thing less this year.”
Williams Commits: After compiling 
the No. 20 recruiting class with four 
signees in 2012, the Gators added just one player in the class of 2013.
But the addition was an impor -
tant one.
Daytona Beach Atlantic forward 
Ronni Williams, the No.13 player in the ESPN HoopGurlz 100, officially signed her National Letter of Intent 
with Florida on Wednesday. Wil-
liams is the top recruit in Florida and the highest-ranked player to ever sign with the Gators.
“The type of kid you see coming 
out now who has professional as-pirations, Ronni is what they look like,” Butler said. “She’s really ver -
satile and has the type of potential 
we want to build on moving for -
ward.”
Williams played three years of 
AAU basketball with freshman Jan-uary Miller, who said Williams was 
a special player and great addition to the program. 
Butler hopes Williams can join 
UF’s current freshmen in blazing a 
trail for the program.
“You can choose to go to pro-
grams that are already established 
and have been doing things the 
same way for the past 20 years,” 
Butler said. “Or you can come to a place like ours where we are trying to do things for the first time and say ‘I want to make history.’ Ronni 
is definitely that type of player.”UF freshmen to be tested in hostile environment against FSUWOMEN’S BASKETBALL
