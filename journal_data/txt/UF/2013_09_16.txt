A Gainesville man who’s been on the run since he killed 
a local man was caught Sunday morning in Hampton, 
Va., by the U.S. Marshals Florida Regional Fugitive Task 
Force.
Ofﬁ  cials arrested Larry Whitehead Jr., 26, on charges 
of ﬁ  rst-degree murder, armed burglary and possession of 
a ﬁ  rearm by a convicted felon after witnesses identiﬁ  ed him as the man responsible for the July murder of Samuel Hamilton, according to a U.S. Marshals press release.
Hamilton, 37, was shot in Unit 4110 of Southern Pine 
Apartments, near the Woodlands complex.
Based on information gathered by detectives, the task force started the investigation in 
Virginia. 
Last week, the force conﬁ  rmed 
Whitehead was staying in New York and 
found his clothes and an air mattress 
in a home where he was believed to be 
hiding.
The task force got word Saturday 
night that Whitehead returned to 
Virginia and was hiding at a house in Hampton, according to the release. 
After watching the house for a short time, Marshals 
found Whitehead inside and arrested him.
He was booked into the Hampton City Jail later that day with no bond.
The arrest came as a relief to 22-year-old Lakeria 
Montgomery, who was sleeping in the same bed as 
Hamilton when Whitehead shot him.
“I can’t believe it,” Montgomery said Sunday evening. 
“There’s peace in my mind now.”
Montgomery said she was in an open relationship 
with Whitehead, who originally said he was OK with the arrangement.
However, he wanted more commitment from 
Montgomery than she could give him, she told the Alligator in August.

Severe knee injuries didn’t stop Myrrhanda Jones from 
placing in the top ﬁ  ve at the Miss America pageant Sunday 
night.
The 20-year-old UF telecommunication junior modeled 
in a zebra bikini, stunned in a pearl white gown and per-formed her baton twirling routine as Miss Florida with one more accessory — a bejeweled knee brace — at Boardwalk Hall in Atlantic City, N.J., earning third runner-up and a $15,000 scholarship.
Jones fell during rehearsal Thursday, 
resulting in a torn anterior cruciate liga-ment and a partially torn medial collateral ligament. 
Just eight hours after a rush to the 
emergency room on a stretcher, she was back on stage to win the talent prelimi-nary competition.
Sorority sisters of Jones, a member of 
Delta Delta Delta, supported her near and 
far Sunday night.
Lexie Byers, a 19-year-old UF public relations sopho-
more, helped coordinate a watch party in the Delta Delta Delta media room to support her big sister, Jones.
Nearly 1,000 miles away, 20-year-old UF telecommuni-
cation sophomore Taylor Nones and 19-year-old UF public relations sophomore Jana Berkowitz cheered on their soror-ity sister from Boardwalk Hall. The pair planned to ﬂ  y to New Jersey for the pageant when Jones won Miss Florida in July.

In the made-over Reitz Union, 
a wall glows vivid hues of orange 
and blue. As students walk by, they cast digital shadows on its surface, reﬂ  ecting computerized images that mirror their movements.
This is the vision for a piece of interactive art that will be built into the renovated area of the Reitz Union.
UF spokesman Steve Orlando 
said the art is still in the planning phase because the artist is waiting for completed building designs.
Bryan Yeager, manager of UF 
public art and university galleries — who is working closely with the artist — said the piece hasn’t been ﬁ  nalized yet, but “it’s well on its way.”
“I am planning to create an in-

Gainesville Police arrested a man after he 
ﬁ  red shots at a group and threw a brick at 
another man’s car last week.
Police arrested Demetrius Eric Filer, 24, 
Thursday on charges of aggravated assault, 
criminal mischief and possession of a ﬁ  rearm 
by a convicted felon, according to a GPD ar-rest report.
In the early afternoon, Filer got into a 
ﬁ  ght with Rashad Antonio Jones at a home in 
the 3500 block of Northeast 12th Street over 
a confrontation between the wives of both men, said Monica Baisden, Jones’ wife. After a witness broke up the ﬁ  ght, he went into his 
house and came out with a riﬂ  e-style gun.
He then pointed the gun at Jones and 
Baisden and told them he was going to shoot 
them.
The couple heard a bang while they were 
retreating and saw that Filer had thrown a 
brick at Jones’ car, cracking the window and 
denting the door.
Filer then ﬁ  red three shots from his gun, 
ran toward a car and drove from the scene, 
according to the report.A police helicopter spotted the car pull-
ing into Eden Park at Ironwood on Northeast 
39th Avenue, wrote GPD Spokesman Ofﬁ  cer Ben Tobias in an email. Ofﬁ  cers found Filer jumping a fence nearby and arrested him.
Back at the scene, an of-
ﬁ  cer saw bullet casings on the ground, according to the report. 
Inside Filer’s home, the 
ofﬁ  cer found a .45-caliber 
Smith & Wesson revolver. A witness also conﬁ  rmed the riﬂ  e-style gun belonged 
to Filer.
Ofﬁ  cers booked Filer into the Alachua 
County Jail at about 7 p.m., where he re-mained Sunday night with a $30,000 bond.
The incident came as a shock to Baisden, 
who said she and her husband were good friends with Filer. She was especially con-cerned because her and Filer’s young chil-dren were outside during the confrontation.
Despite the previous friendship, Baisden 
said she’s glad Filer is behind bars.

Although scooters are common and 
can be prone to mishaps, campus police 
say accident reports are infrequent.
Captain Jeff Holcomb, of  University 
Police, said the department generally 
does not receive many reports of scooter 
accidents despite the large population of scooter riders on campus.
If no one involved in an accident is 
seriously injured, they may not feel the need to involve law enforcement, he said. It is also rare that the scooter ac-cidents reported at UF result in serious injuries.
According to law, he said, a person is 
only required to wear a helmet if they’re under 21 years of age and if the scooter exceeds a certain size.Holcomb also said sometimes when 
scooter accidents occur, the rider does not have much experience.
“A lot of times, students aren’t famil-
iar with operating something at those 
speeds in that manner,” he said.
Jennifer Johnson, a 21-year-old UF 
architecture junior, has been driving 
a scooter for about a year. She said she feels safer riding on and near campus be-cause, in other areas, cars to tend to drive much faster than scooters can.
Johnson said she wears a helmet 
about 95 percent of the time, even though 
she notices many peers without one. She 
thinks of it as assurance of her safety.
“When I’m riding, I always feel like 
someone is going to be on the phone tex-ting or not looking, and I’m going to be hit,” she said.
Holcomb’s recommendation to driv-
ers of larger vehicles is to “be aware that there are a lot of scooters sharing the 
road with us in Gainesville.”Scooter accident reports

can make somebody love you, but you just can’t do that.”
Montgomery isn’t sure if she’s ever 
going to speak to Whitehead again, she said. 
But for now, his arrest is enough 
closure.
“I just want to move on with my life,” 
she said. “I’m ready to move on with my life.”
Along with the Florida Regional 
Fugitive Task Force, the arrest was made in collaboration with Capital Area Regional Fugitive Task Force in Virginia and the New York/New Jersey Regional Fugitive 
Task Force in New York.
Whitehead has a previous criminal 
background, according to court records.
His history includes aggravated assault 
and armed robbery charges, according to court records.4, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 16, 2013

Interactive light installations are being designed by Ivan Toth Depeña for the Reitz Union 
renovations. A piece similar to the one pictured should be on permanent display in 2015.
State-funded building projects have to set aside money for art
piece and change its composition in real 
time. The installation is currently planned to vertically span the two lower, public lev-els of the new buildings lobby.”
Depeña is currently working with UF 
Facilities, Planning & Construction on the  logistics. 
The interactive wall will be built into the 
new building’s structure. 
It’s expected to be completed by the 
grand opening of the renovated Reitz around Fall 2015.
Amy Vigilante, director of university 
galleries, said whenever a state building is being built, a certain percentage of that building’s funds is required to go toward buying art.
“Every project with state funding sets 
aside 0.5 percent of the construction budget with a maximum of $100,000 for Art in State 
Buildings program,” Orlando wrote in an 
email. “The Reitz Union has a $100,000 line 
item for the ASB, and it has been in the bud-get since the project’s inception.”
Once the money was set aside, a commit-
tee was formed to select the artist. 
Student representatives suggested the 
piece be young and interactive, and the committee selected Depeña specifically for that purpose.
Depeña is a graduate of the New World 
School of the Arts high school in Miami, which is partnered with UF.
“He went there, so we’re kind of proud 
of that because he really is an alum,” Vigi-lante said.
Since then, Depeña has received his 
bachelor’s degree in architecture from the University of Miami and his master’s in ar-chitecture from Harvard.
Orlando said the fact the artwork chosen 
for the Reitz renovation is a contemporary piece in an area that has a huge flow of stu-dent and visitor traffic will be a positive im-age.
“It sort of reflects our Student Body — 
young, energetic, creative people,” Orlando said. “I think that’s a good connection and a good message to convey.”ArT , from page 1LIFESTYLE

Researchers with UF’s Institute of Food and Agricul-
tural Sciences have continued to improve the freshness 
and flavor of Florida-grown strawberries.
Strawberries are cultivated based on specific traits, in-
cluding flavor, color, size and amount produced.
The institute’s latest strawberry strands successes in-
clude Winterstar and Florida Sensation.
The Winterstar has a flavor that is less acidic than nor-
mal strawberries, creating a sweeter taste, said Ted Camp-bell, executive director of the Florida Strawberry Growers Association.
The Florida Sensation is known to have a desirable 
taste, but some say its best attribute is having early pro-duction yield throughout the year.
“The Florida Sensation strand has a very steady pro-
duction. This means the strand may produce strawberries even before Christmas, which is very early,” Campbell said. “This strand is very lucrative.”
The two breeds have been produced through marker-
assisted breeding in a matter of five years, Campbell said. 
Through traditional breeding, strands take more than 10 
years, with 30,000 to 100,000 crossings to show promise.
“Through genetic mapping, we saw the promise in 
these strands and saw it as important to move into pat-ent,” Campbell said. “Thanks to marker-assisted breed-ing, we have a road map to see where we want to make 
modifications.”
UF is now looking to negotiate with parties interested 
in licensing and growing the variety.
The strawberries will be planted in early October and 
will be harvested after Thanksgiving until Easter. The 
plants are picked every three days in a four-month pe-riod.
Fresh, Florida-grown strawberries are available to con-
sumers from December until April, said Brody Griffith, a 
22-year-old natural resource conservation junior.
“Some of the best-tasting strawberries are grown in 
Florida,” he said.
The strawberries won’t be labeled by variety. Winter-
star will be available in grocery aisles this winter, while 
Florida Sensation is expected to be available in 2014.UF IFAS researchers breed sweeter strawberries earlier

A new Chipotle app now allows customers to earn free food if 
they play a farm-themed game and score high. The Scarecrow, is 
available for download for iPhone, iPad and iPod users.
In the game, users guide a scarecrow character through a series 
of scenarios related to food production and distribution, includ-
ing a level where users help the scarecrow fly confined animals to 
open pastures.
If players unlock all four levels and score at least three stars, 
they can earn deals such as buy one, get one free offers redeemable in store, according to contest rules on Chipotle’s website.
Maggie Schwartzman, a 20-year-old UF telecommunication ju-
nior, said the app is a smart idea for Chipotle’s company and for their customers.
“It seems like a very good marketing tool for Chipotle and 
something that customers will really enjoy,” Schwartzman said.
Phillip Ayers, a manager at locally based Burrito Bros. Taco Co., 
said he doesn’t fear competition the app could potentially spark.
Burrito Bros. is not corporately owned, so the restaurants have 
different customer bases, he said. Burrito Bros. has been around longer in Gainesville, Ayers said, and the customers are not look-
ing for the same thing Chipotle customers are.Chipotle app offers free food for high scores� CONSTRUCTION SHOULD LAST

Upcoming construction of a new left 
turn lane on Northwest 34th Street into the 
North Central Florida YMCA complex will cause traffic delays, but it’s also expected to improve roadway safety by 53rd Avenue.
Construction is slated to begin Tues-day and should take about two months to complete, said Laurie Windham, a spokes-woman for the project.
One lane on the street will be closed off, 
and construction crews will direct traffic. The lane closure will occur between 8:30 a.m. and 4 p.m., according to a Department of Transportation press release.
Building the new 12-foot left turn lane 
will include widening the road by six feet on each side and upgrading drainage.
The purpose of the lane is to ease traffic 
delays in the area, she said.Scott Chase, the aquatics director at the 
YMCA, said he’s seen many accidents oc-cur in front of the complex and hopes the new lane will change that.
The $370,600 project is being built by 
V.E. Whitehurst & Sons Inc. of Williston.
Francisco Cubero, a 24-year-old YMCA 
employee, said patrons are annoyed about the upcoming traffic delays but optimistic 
about the safety improvements.
“A lot of them said that they would 
have to suffer through this a little, but it 
will be worth it,” Cubero said.New lane on 34th to help more turn to YMCA

A cheating scandal dishonored the then 
64-year-old UF Honor Code, leading to an update to make it more useful. Rather than signing the honor pledge on every 
assignment, students would have to sign 
a “commitment to academic honesty” on their academic advisement card. Although 90 percent of cheating cases were handled privately, the change put heavier emphasis on the Student Judiciary.
Sept. 18, 1984Gainesville Fire Rescue ignited some 
problems for the City of Alachua firemen. The firemen threatened to limit service in order to be paid at the same rate as their Gainesville counterparts. The County Commission said it would be unlikely they would get the $358 raise, as the two city contracts were designed differently.

After four years of failing to attract a 
permanent colony, the Bat House near Lake Alice boasted about 8,000 winged 
occupants. UF’s wildlife ecology and con-servation department had been monitoring the house since 1991, but only small groups ever flew in temporarily — 18 in 1993 and 
300 in 1994. The researchers said they could 
confirm the population would likely be permanent because the bats started breed-ing.
Sept. 16, 2010Students and employees got a new way 
to get around the outside of campus and get to Shands. The Gotcha Group launched 
six-seat electric vehicles to provide more 
free options for the people of Gainesville. They would not operate on campus dur-ing the day to prevent interference with Regional Transit System but would be an-other option for special event traffic. They would have two shifts, with a small break in between to allow time to recharge the 12 car batteries in each vehicle.

As Alachua County schools are getting classes into 
full swing, teachers and staff at the Horizon Center — 
including UF graduates — are working against the odds.
Horizon Center is the nearest local alternative 
school, also called a last-chance school, which is a cat-egory of institutions often considered the final oppor-tunity for troubled students to turn their lives around.
Anntwanique Edwards, the as-
sistant principal of the center, lo-cated at 2802 NE Eighth Ave., said a handful of its staff are UF gradu-ates, including the principal. Even though last-chance schools are 
sometimes considered a tough envi-
ronment, Edwards said it’s no more 
challenging than teaching at a stan-dard school.
“Generally, the kids have disciplinary issues and 
have had a lot of opportunities to make changes and haven’t been able to do that,” she said. “A lot of peo-ple think because they’re not in their zoned schools, they’re troubled kids. But you get here and you think, 
‘They’re the same as the kids on other campuses.’”
Molly McDole, a 21-year-old UF education senior, 
said although teaching at alternative schools could be 
difficult at first, it could be a good opportunity for new teachers to leave an impression on students.
“I can only imagine how hard a job like that would 
be for a first-year teacher,” she said. “But I think ap-plying some new methods in the classroom could offer kids a new perspective on education.”
McDole said teaching students with disciplinary is-
sues could help teachers change their perspectives on those who attend alternative schools.
“A lot of what our program teaches is to leave our 
preconceived ideas at the door,” she said.
Tarah Benefield, a 21-year-old UF education senior, 
said working at a last-chance school could help young teachers hone their skills and develop more under-standing.
“I think we can learn a lot about working with 
kids and what kind of techniques work for trouble students,” she said. “Maybe they never got the right amount of positive attention, but teachers can help them develop and steer them in the right direction.”School provides

The National Science Foundation 
awarded scientists of the McGuire Cen-
ter at the Florida Museum of Natural History a grant to classify a common but data-rich butterfly group.
A $458,104 grant was given to clas-
sify the often-misidentified Euptychiina subtribe, which is commonly found throughout the Americas and represents a group of more than 400 species.
The money will fund projects to dis-
tinguish Euptychiina species and send students to sites around the world.
Currently there are about 14,000 Eup-
tychiina specimens at the Florida Mu-seum that cannot be reliably identified, said principal investigator Keith Will-mott, associate curator of lepidoptera at 
the Florida Museum.
“They’re small and largely drab, 
which is probably part of the reason 
why they haven’t been studied thus far,” said Willmott.
The typically brown Euptychiina is a 
common species to find in wooded hab-itats in Gainesville, but they are mainly found with expansive diversity in South 
America.
Just because two species look alike 
doesn’t mean they’re the same. Like-
wise, just because two species look dif-ferent doesn’t mean they are different, said Andrew D. Warren, senior collec-tions manager at the center.  
Figuring out how these butterflies 
evolved, particularly in South America, 
will have widespread implications for the evolution of other butterfly groups, 
said Willmott.
“Given that we know this is a dif-
ficult group to identify, there will be a pretty heavy reliance on DNA testing,” said Warren.
This group of butterflies is more 
sedentary than its largely colored, fast-flying relatives. As a result, Eupychiina butterflies give a better understanding of the climate in which these butterflies live, Willmott said.
Genetic data will give a fresh coat of 
paint to a rarely touched realm of but-terfly research. The new approach will give researchers clues for classifying di-versity within this species, he said.
Funding will go into creating a web-
site for public use that will have the abil-ity to search for distribution, diversity and speciation of these butterflies, along 
with images, Willmott said. Florida Museum receives butterfly grant

Algae could help provide a whole new meaning to the 
phrase “going green.” The organisms have the potential to 
be used as a source of oil, UF graduate research assistant and doctoral student Elton Goncalves said. In fact, he said he is certain renewable energy is headed in that direction.
Goncalves, 27, recently found that oil accumulation in algae 
occurs within three hours of nitrogen being removed from the medium, according to a study published in the journal Planta. Scientists previously believed the timetable to be closer to two days.
Bala Rathinasabapathi, a UF horticultural professor who 
worked on the study, said the discovery was a small step in the algal-oil process.
There is still a paradox to overcome, Rathinasabapathi 
said, because when nitrogen is removed from the medium — stressing the algae cells — chloroplasts are destroyed. The chloroplast is a key element of photosynthesis. Without it, the 
algae begin to go dormant or die.
However, the removal of the nitrogen stimulates oil accu-
mulation.
Therefore, Rathinasabapathi said, the problem is that scien-
tists know how to get oil from the algae, but they don’t know 
how to do so without killing it.
This study is significant, Goncalves said, because scientists now know they have to study the cells three hours, not three days, after stressing the algae.
Seventy percent of the cell’s mass becomes oil when the 
alga is stressed. If scientists can learn which “switches” trigger the oil accumulation, Goncalves said, scientists can find a way to flip those switches and get oil without robbing the algae of nitrogen.
Algae have been used in the past to create biofuel, Rathi-
nasabapathi said, but discovering this pathway would make the process easier, more productive and more economically feasible.
Ann Wilkie, a UF environmental microbiology associate 
professor, is also optimistic about the future of algae as a re-newable resource.
“Algal biofuels offer great promise,” she said. “Anything 
that helps us understand the metabolism of the cell is certainly 
a step in the right direction.”
Although the process is currently in the early research and 
development stages, she said, the research field has made a lot 
of progress in regard to algae and oil accumulation.UF scientists: Algae could be source of oilEdwards

rape culture, Part 1:
Victims are punished 
This month, we’ve published a contributing writer’s series 
on rape culture, including details of an alleged mishan-dling of a case by local police in 2009.
Campus rape has been an issue for decades, and only recent 
progress has been made in holding universities accountable for 
disciplining aggressors and providing appropriate victim ser-
vices for survivors. 
This week, we’re running an editorial series on the issue of 
underreported rape on college campuses, what UF can do to change students’ attitude toward sexual violence and what stu-dents can do to help their peers and aid the cause.
The nation has seen a shocking amount of high-proﬁ  le uni-
versity rape scandals this year. According to Time magazine, “by the end of July, the Department of Education’s Ofﬁ  ce of Civil 
Rights had received 48 complaints regarding Title IX violations 
related to sexual violence.” The most recent scandal involves Vanderbilt University football player Chris Boyd.
However, it’s not that sexual violence is rising, but as more 
resources become available to women, more women are coming forward and reporting sexual assault and rape. The often-quot-ed statistic that about one in four women will be raped while attending college has remained unfortunately constant.
The fact that more schools are being held accountable gives 
us hope, especially because reports of universities mishandling sexual violence cases are in the news almost every week.
One of the most striking cases of administrative inaction in 
regard to campus rape is at Amherst College, a supposedly pro-gressive small liberal arts college in Massachusetts. In 2012, Am-herst’s student newspaper published a rape survivor’s story of how her case was grossly mishandled by the administration.
A counselor reportedly told the victim that pressing charges 
would be useless and was advised to “forgive and forget.” The 
victim ended up transferring out of Amherst, while her rapist 
graduated with honors.
Of course, it’s no surprise that universities make an effort to 
cover up scandals, especially ones concerning sexual violence. The cost of one rape victim’s transfer out of the college is far smaller than negative national attention, especially for highly ranked schools. For example, Amherst has consistently held the No. 2 spot in the U.S. News & World Report National Liberal Arts College Rankings, and negative press could affect that rat-
ing.
This sends a damaging message to women, especially vic-
tims of sexual violence, and contributes to the low reporting 
rates of rape and assault: About 95 percent of campus rapes go unreported, according to the American Association of Univer-sity Women. Women shouldn’t have to mitigate the effects of rape — sexually transmitted diseases, depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder — on their own, and colleges need to aggressively move forward in preventing campus rape and counseling victims.
Tomorrow, we’ll talk about what UF can do — and already 
has done — to open this conversation.

app?Scandalized politicians’ losses offer hope
Everybody knows politics is a dirty business, and 
some elected ofﬁ  cials are far dirtier than others. Anthony Weiner and Eliot Spitzer learned that 
fact the hard way, and last week, they watched their po-tential political comebacks ﬁ  zzle like the Gators’ offense did in the red zone against Miami.
Weiner and Spitzer were once two of the brightest 
political stars in New York. 
Weiner was the hard-charging liberal congressman, 
and Spitzer was the state attorney general and then gov-ernor who took pride in putting cheating investment bankers behind bars.
However, once Weiner sent lewd photos over Twitter 
and Spitzer was caught having sex with a high-priced escort, the game was over. 
Both men resigned in disgrace and their political ca-
reers appeared to be dead.
Oh, how short the memory of a voter can be — or so 
Weiner and Spitzer hoped.  
Earlier this year, both men took bold steps to rehabil-
itate their political careers, but — especially for Weiner 
— it all came crashing down.  
Weiner ran for mayor of New York City, while 
Spitzer ran for city comptroller. 
At the start, both campaigns appeared solid, and it 
seemed, for an instant, that New Yorkers were just as 
forgiving toward Weiner and Spitzer as much of the United States was toward Bill Clinton.
Spitzer remained relatively quiet in the national 
press throughout his campaign and actually fared well 
last week — but still came up short. 
The defeat of both Weiner and Spitzer underscores 
the fact that not all politicians can ﬁ  nd forgiveness fol-
lowing sex scandals.
By and large, Americans don’t trust politicians. 
Elected ofﬁ  cials are typically behind lawyers and repeat offenders on the list of people Americans trust least. We ﬁ  nd them to be dishonest, disloyal, self-serving and out-of-touch. 
What is so funny about this 
is though lawyers aren’t hired by the mass numbers of voters, we continue to give jobs to the 
politicians we dislike just as ve-
hemently. 
We can either continue to send people we distrust 
to serve as public ofﬁ  cials at all levels of government, or we can stand up and ﬁ  nd a person who is honest, 
delivers on his or her promises and is getting involved 
in government for the right reasons.
Despite our  tendency to ignore the hard work of 
elected ofﬁ  cials, many of them throughout the country 
are upstanding citizens doing the people’s work. We 
might spend our time focusing on the crooks, the cheat-ers, the liars, the partisan hacks or the slimeballs, but more often than not, politicians are just trying to do the right thing.
There was a time in this nation’s history when we 
revered our elected ofﬁ  cials. They were strong individ-uals who stood up for what was right and served the people before special interests.
It sounds like a pipe dream, but it has happened be-
fore, and if we care enough — like New Yorkers did last week — we can make it happen again. 
Good, upstanding citizens are everywhere, and some 
are even willing to take the plunge and run for public 
ofﬁ  ce.
If we get them elected, hold them accountable and 
are willing to ﬁ  re them if they fail, we can put an end 
to the politics of Weiner and Spitzer and ﬁ  nd the politi-
cians who actually put the people ﬁ  rst.

opinions@alligator.org MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 16, 2013  ALLIGATOR, 7
The phrase sounds better in Spanish, the way I heard it ﬁ  rst: 
“Amor con hambre no dura.” “Hungry love doesn’t last.”
I’m used to these little proverbs. I learned my ﬁ  rst lan-
guage through them, uttered by adults surrounding a coffee ta-ble, teachers reprimanding a classmate and old ladies gossiping in a bakery line.
Immigrants to the U.S. often translate their own colloquial 
phrases into English, packing culture and history into sentences that run too long or make no sense to native Anglophones. I, too, can pick them out, these lexical anomalies, when I hear them. I put them in a mental jar and save them for when words fail.
I collected the one I mentioned above Thursday night at the 
opening screening of “Madres 0.15 el minute,” or “Mothers, 15 cents a minute,” a ﬁ  lm by director Marina Seresesky and the ﬁ  rst of six ﬁ  lms shown this month during the Gainesville Latino Film Festival.
The ﬁ  lm focuses on women who have left their homes and their 
children to search for work and a better life in another country.
One of the women in the ﬁ  lm has lived and worked as a house-
keeper in Spain for a decade, and she sends a check every week to her parents, who take care of her daughter in Colombia. Vivian 
spends her free time in a telephone booth, dialing an internation-
al number over and over, wincing when the line is busy and sigh-ing in relief when her daughter ﬁ  nally picks up. She asks Manu-ela about homework and her health in a few minutes of normal 
mother-daughter conversation. Then it’s time to hang up — she 
swallows back tears.
She missed her only daughter’s transformation from a toothy 
toddler into a talented, beautiful teenager. When asked why she doesn’t go back to Colombia to be with her daughter, she said 
“Amor con hambre no dura.”
As I walked out of the theater at the Samuel P. Harn Museum 
of Art on Thursday, the proverb echoed. I couldn’t stop thinking 
about the immense sacriﬁ  ce of the women in the ﬁ  lm, working 
to alleviate their children’s physical hunger but knowing it will 
never be enough to ﬁ  ll the void of time spent away.
I am the child of immigrants and an immigrant myself. Send-
ing American money back to our family was what saved my par-ents from the initial loneliness and hardship of moving to a new 
country. We were lucky enough to stay together during the tran-
sition, and my parents didn’t have to raise me from a telephone booth. 
Other immigrants to America aren’t as lucky.A report by the Immigration Policy 
Center titled Falling Through the Cracks gives statistical evidence of the correla-
tion between immigration enforcement 
and the child welfare system in America and revealed that the nation’s laws on immigration are separating families ev-
ery day.
Right now, there are 5.5 million chil-
dren in the U.S., mostly U.S.-born citizens, who live with at least 
one parent who is an unauthorized immigrant, according to the report.
Statistics from the Department of Homeland Security show 
that between July 1, 2010 and Sept. 31, 2012, the parents of 204,810 U.S. citizen children were removed from the U.S. 
A dramatic rise of parental removals in recent years coincides 
with the immigration-enforcement policy shift that further in-volves the criminal justice system, stated the Immigration Policy Center report. According to Immigration and Customs Enforce-ment statistics, more than half of deportees in 2011 were identi-ﬁ  ed as “criminal aliens,” even if they committed nonviolent of-
fenses. 
The system does not consider the fate of children who are sep-
arated from their deported parents. 
Directly from the Immigration and Customs Enforcement web-
site: The 287(g) program, one of ICE’s top partnership initiatives, 
allows a state and local law enforcement entity to enter into a partnership with ICE under a joint Memorandum of Agreement.  The state or local entity receives delegated authority for immigra-tion enforcement within their jurisdictions.
The IPC report shows that in places with 287(g) agreements, 
children in foster care are 29 percent more likely to have a de-tained or deported parent.
If the parents still maintain the right to make the decision to 
take their children with them, often the choice becomes difﬁ  cult if they know they would be taking their children back to a an economic wasteland or politically troubled country. 
They are often forced to make the hard choice, leaving them 
in the states to parent from a telephone booth in their own coun-
tries. 
After all, hungry love doesn’t last.

opinions@alligator.orgAs we ponder military ac-
tion against Syria, two say-ings come to mind: “Where 
there’s smoke there’s ﬁ  re,” and “a picture is worth a thousand 
words.”
The lat-
ter phrase 
sums up why we are having this discussion in the ﬁ  rst place. A photograph released Aug. 21 showed the bodies of Syrians killed 
in a gas attack by pro-government 
forces.
Reports have put the loss of life 
in Syria at about 100,000 people since the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad in March of 2011. The fact that Syria is resorting to using chemical weapons against its own citizens is a disturbing sign 
that the smoke warnings over the 
last few years are about to turn into a ﬁ  re that needs to be stamped out.
The United States has stayed on 
the sidelines for long enough. It’s time we entered the fray despite the lack of public support thus far. It’s understandable that there is a great reluctance to intervene in Syr-
ia, especially with the bitter taste of 
Iraq still fresh in our mouths, but the continued escalation in Syria demands our attention.
It’s hard to ignore the use of 
chemical weapons in August that killed 1,429 people, including 426 children, according to various re-ports. The numbers show Assad 
has become more aggressive in his 
tactics in using chemical weapons, and the trend is on the upward swing. This needs to be taken care of, even though a “limited strike” — as President Barack Obama put it — still constitutes an act of war.
An average of 165 Syrians are 
being killed daily, and in the next 
year that ﬁ  gure could total 60,000. 
Are we really willing to sit back on our moral stance against war while thousands of innocent people are being killed? What if a few missile strikes could make a difference? 
The point of our potential mili-
tary intervention is to discour-age the use of chemical weapons. 
Showing Syria and Assad that we 
mean business may just dissuade them from being so liberal in their use of violence. Thus far they have showed no signs of reducing their aggression towards their own peo-ple. 
Our country doesn’t want to go 
war. Obama doesn’t want to go to 
war. But right now our country is 
in the best position to do something about these atrocities, as unpleasant as it might be. Besides, who else is going stand to up and take action?
As the saying goes, “It’s a dirty 
job, but someone’s gotta do it.”

Students who paint memori-
als on the 34th Street Wall to honor 
friends and loved ones eventually mourn the artwork itself.
The pink-painted memorial for 
Lauren Marcus, a recent UF alumna who passed away on Aug. 19, has shown signs of being graffitied on 
less than two weeks after it was cre-
ated.
“That’s horrible,” said Marissa 
Jaacobi, a 20-year-old UF marketing junior, who was a friend of Marcus’ and helped paint the memorial. “I 
think it’s extremely disrespectful.”Although painting on the wall 
is a Gainesville tradition, some stu-
dents decide to respect the memo-rial sections, while others choose to paint over them.
Jaacobi said when she and her 
friends first discussed painting the wall, they talked about what would happen when it was eventually 
painted over. She said she thought 
people would wait longer.
“There are lots of other spots 
that aren’t dedicated to people,” she said.
Another one of Marcus’ friends, 
Marissa Bernstein, said she was not surprised that section of the wall has been painted again.
“People are people. There’s noth-
ing you can do about it,” said the 20-year-old UF telecommunication senior.
Marcus’ memorial is pink and 
says “in loving memory of Lauren Marcus.” It is covered with notes to her from her friends and loved ones. The graffiti is blue spray paint 
that says “fr8 train” with a star in a blue box.
Marcus’ is not the only memorial 
on the wall that has been painted on.
A few panels from Marcus’ sec-
tion of the wall is a memorial for Leland Wade Carlton, a father and 
husband whose panel has been up 
for about a year and is showing signs of being repainted. That section is next to the one honoring the victims of the Gainesville murders, which is retouched every few months be-cause of grafitti. 
Occasionally, student volunteers will come in and paint over the stray spray paint, including hateful re-marks painted in the “remember” section in November.
There is no public entity in charge 
of whitewashing or maintaining the paint on the wall, according to Gainesville Public Works.
Despite the additional paintings 
to the mural, Bernstein said the most important part of the memorial was the gathering together of friends to honor Marcus.
“It was nice, meaningful,” she 
said. “It’s more about the act than the aftermath ... It doesn’t take away from what we did.”

UF students will be able to 
receive free flu shots starting at 
the end of the week.
The Student Health Care 
Center is sponsoring its annual 
flu shot kickoff event Friday on 
the infirmary lawn starting at 9 a.m. The first  750 vaccinated students will receive free T-shirts, pens and GatorWell Health Promotion Services giveaways, up 250 from last year.
The kickoff event expects to 
vaccinate about 500 students. About 9,000 students, faculty and staff are expected to be vaccinated by the end of flu season in May, said Catherine Seemann, Student Health Care Center spokeswoman.Intradermal shots with 90 
percent smaller needles will be available for $15 for students, $25 for faculty and staff. Flu-Mist will not be offered this year.
Shots remain free for stu-
dents until the end of the school year. Faculty and staff can be 
vaccinated at the Benefits Fair 
for employees on Oct. 30.
Currently, the estimated 
number of cases of the flu in Florida is low compared to the national baseline, said Heather Rubino, influenza coordinator for the Florida Department of Health.
Flu season is expected to 
pick up soon, spiking after Winter Break on campus. Stu-dents seeking vaccinations will also pick up sharply  after the break, Seemann said.
“Students see everyone 
around them getting sick and they figure it’s time for them to 
get the shot,” she said.SHCC offers free flu

GatorWell Health Promotion Services has 
kicked off a new Fall mental health promo-
tions segment to target student stress levels.
The project, UFlourish, started in the 
Spring as part of a three-year project funded 
by Substance Abuse and Mental Health Ser-
vices Administration. It was developed be-tween the Counseling and Wellness Center, and GatorWell.
In the Spring, the campaign was called 
Find Your Balance and featured images of students with the uplifting phrase and sta-tistics. The next step is underway, which involves tackling specific stigmas more di-rectly.
“We’re trying to change the stigma sur-
rounding mental health and getting help,” said Health Promotions Specialist Sarah Martin. “That includes use of protective strategies for stress, anxiety and depression at the same time before seeking help.”
According to a national survey of college students in 2012, posted on the GatorWell website, 45 percent of students reported feel-ing hopeless within the past year, 85 percent said they were overwhelmed and 30 percent said they “felt so depressed that it was dif-ficult to function.”
The Fall campaign of UFlourish is now 
composed of several different targeted mes-sages including “get active,” “take a deep breath” and “you’re not a burden.”
UFlourish is using social media to publi-
cize its new messages across campus.
“We try to make them relevant,” Martin 
said. “Drafts were all message-tested with students on campus.”
The project started out with 40 possible 
designs and ended up with nine.
“I think it’s a great idea to get people to 
start to talk,” said 21-year-old UF electrical engineering senior Michelle Russell.UF puts stress on mental health

The downtown sushi restaurant 
Dragonfly is undergoing its first meta-
morphosis since it opened 13 years ago.
Remodeling is estimated to take 30 
days, during which the restaurant will 
remain open, said Hirofumi Leung, the 
restaurant owner and a UF alumnus.
Although the front of the building is 
partially boarded with plywood, he said customers will not be inconvenienced because construction starts at midnight and is cleaned up by morning.
“It’s kind of like elves working in the 
middle of the night,” Leung said.
As for the decor, the renovations will 
include more traditional Japanese inspi-ration in an effort to incorporate the cul-ture of the food into the atmosphere.
JMA Contracting is using recycled 
wood and steel pieces for the renova-tions.
“The beautiful thing about the re-
claimed pieces is they have so much his-tory. With technology and everything moving forward, we thought it would be good to go back,” Leung said. “You 
can’t forget your roots.”
Myriam Robinson, a 19-year-old UF 
advertising sophomore, doesn’t think 
the renovations will deter customers.
“As long as it is clear on the outside 
that it is still open, I would still go there,” she said.
Emily Cardinal, a 19-year-old UF 
journalism sophomore, said she isn’t concerned with how the renovations will affect the dining experience.
“It’s my favorite restaurant in

Gators in the AP poll
Despite enjoying their ﬁ  rst of two bye weeks this 
weekend, the Gators slipped one spot to No. 19 in the newest edition of the Associated Press poll. The Florida men’s cross country team won the Mountain Dew Invitational on Saturday. Read the story on page 16. STATE COLLEGE, Pa. — The faint smell of cow manure travels to 
the hallowed grounds from a 
campus farm just across the 
way. Rolling hills with lush trees resemble the opening scene from “Jurassic Park” as the camera pans away to re-veal a vast expanse of green. 
Echoes of the past whistle along 
with the mid-state Pennsylvania breeze. 
Signs bearing Joe Paterno’s name dot the stadium walls while his statue remains 
absent. I spent ﬁ  ve days visiting Penn 
State. I didn’t know what to expect from a school that saw its once-revered foot-ball program crumble in a month. 
I arrived in State College on Wednes-
day to see my girlfriend. We visited the stadium on Friday where the tiny town was abuzz with a matchup against Central Florida looming. State Col-
lege lives and breathes 
Penn State football. Per-haps that’s a product of having one coach for 46 
years, but the experience 
is something Gainesville ought to emulate.
Tents, a la Krzyzewskiville, popu-
lated Gate A with students camping out 
at Nittanyville to select their seats to 
the season’s second home game. Florida has a similar program with its Beat T-shirt campouts, but these students were

Under coach Mary Wise, the Gators are no strangers to 
high-powered offenses.
Since 1991, Florida has averaged a .297 hitting percentage. 
The program ﬁ  nished among the top-10 schools in offensive 
efﬁ  ciency 14 times since 1995.
Benavia Jenkins’ 1.000 clip on Oct. 12, 2001, and Chloe 
Mann’s .900 clip on Nov. 11, 2011, are among the all-time 
highest averages in a single game in NCAA history.
And with a .338 team average so far this season, the 
Gators are on pace to be one of the country’s top offenses 
once again.
But the offense will not mean a thing if the defense has 
more holes than the net on the court.
On Saturday, No. 5 Florida (8-1) allowed Western Michi-
gan (3-1) to hit .309, which was the highest hitting percentage by a visiting opponent in a regular season match since Gator-
Zone.com started recording box scores in 1999.
During the intermission of the Iona match Saturday after-
noon, Wise said she could already see her younger outside 
hitters being “mono-focused” on offense while letting their defensive game fall by the wayside.
Just a few hours after addressing the problem in the ﬁ  rst 
match of the day, Wise saw the Broncos exploit the Gators’ defense behind the play of middle blocker Stephenee Yancy, who recorded a .613 clip on 20 kills.
“She is a handful,” Wise said. “We knew the ball was go-
ing to her, but obviously we had no answer.”
Yancy, who hit just shy of her personal record of .625,  
found the gaps in Florida’s defense behind the slide play that left the Gators stumped all night.
The slide is an attack where the middle blocker usually 
takes off on one foot rather than two while moving alongside the net to catch the defense off guard. Coming from behind Florida defense lagging behind historic offensive output

With fewer than 30 seconds left to win 
the game, Pamela Begic had a choice. 
From 15 yards out, the freshman mid-
ﬁ  elder could take a shot on South Florida 
goalkeeper Christiane Endler or dish the ball out to Havana Solaun, who was the only Gator to beat Endler and score a 
goal on the night.
Begic sent it to Solaun, who diverted 
it to freshman Savannah Jordan, who is 
UF’s leading goal scorer. 
With 9 seconds left, Jordan headed 
a weak ball into the arms of Endler to bring the match to a 1-1 draw after two overtime periods in Tampa.
Although there was 109:30 of missed 
chances and untimely fouls by No. 9 Florida (6-1-1) that led up to the ﬁ  nal play, the burden of the game still fell 
on the shoulders of the 18-year-old Slo-
venian when the ball landed by her feet with time expiring.
Coach Becky Burleigh said although 
she would have preferred a goal to give the Gators the victory, she was still im-pressed by the levelheaded play of her freshman.
“I think Pam’s po-
sition was to try and catch the goalkeeper out of position and 
play the ball to Havana,” Burleigh said.
“I wouldn’t have argued if she had 
taken that shot. 
“I thought it was a really unselﬁ  sh 
play in the waning seconds. It just shows her composure.”
On a wet and windy day at South 
Florida (4-1-3), Burleigh said she thought Gators miss on last-second 
chance, tie Bulls in Tampa

72 total votesthe entire 110 minutes of play was a test for UF and its ability to 
maintain composure.
Florida quickly found itself down one goal after the Bulls’ 
Sharla Passariello found the back of the net in the seventh min-ute.
For goalkeeper Taylor Burke, the goal was the first she al-
lowed since giving up her first of the season against Oregon State 
on Aug. 25.
“It was a great test for us to go down that early,” Burleigh 
said. 
“It was kind of a mental error on our part to give up the goal, 
but to see us get that goal back was really a step in the right di-rection for us.”
But getting the equalizer took patience by the Gators, who had 
to wait until Claire Falknor assisted Solaun for Florida’s first goal 
in the 74th minute. 
Solaun raised her goal total on the season to four while Fal-
knor recorded her second assist on the year.
But after forcing the Bulls into their third overtime of the sea-son, the Gators could not capitalize on their momentum and fin-ished in a draw for the first time this year and the first time since 
tying North Carolina on Aug. 24, 2012.
“It was an unfortunate tie for us because of the amount of op-
portunities that we had,” Burleigh said.
The Gators more than doubled the Bulls’ eight shots, taking 
20, including 10 shots on goal. However, with only one of those 
balls ending up in the back of the net, it was the worst shooting percentage by Florida since being shut out against Florida State on Aug. 30.
But Burleigh said she was proud of her team for doing some-
thing it never really had to do all year: come from behind in a tough environment.
“That’s the first time we’ve really trailed a game and come 
back and got the equalizer this season,” she said. “This is going to help create and build our mentality.”the setter, the attacker can pinpoint 
a hole in the defense and exploit it with a quick running hit.
Wise said her team will see 
more of the same from Florida State, which runs a double slide, on Tuesday.
“As good an offense (as) West-
ern Michigan is, Florida State is one of the best in the country,” she said. 
“You just look at the scores 
from a year ago, and we had no answer for them. So we’ll need our young players to think a lot about defense between now and then.”
However, even when the Gators 
had a week to prepare for the three schools visiting to compete in the Active Ankle Challenge, they still struggled defensively.
In a radio interview after de-
feating Western Michigan, Wise said she felt bad for UF associate head coach Dave Boos.
Boos drilled the squad on de-
fending the slide the week before the tournament.
While Wise continues to work 
with players like Gabby Mallette 
and Alex Holston, whom Wise 
said drove her crazy by being so “mono-focused” on offense, she said she will continue to lean 
on Ziva Recek to get the squad 
through these tough matches.
The sophomore outside hitter 
led all Gators with 21 kills while adding 10 digs for her 12th career 
double-double.
“We rely so heavily on her,” 
Wise said. 
“She grounds our team and we 
rely her IQ, her experience (and) 
her confidence. So she’s (a) pretty important player for us.”

Unlike at UF, passion remains intense for Penn State football 
home of Peachy Paterno ice cream — from 
the stadium for a cold treat. Here’s hoping Sweet Dreams comes out with Muschamp 
Mint Chocolate Chip. 
Exit the brick campus, which resembles 
its sister school from Gainesville, and 
McLanahan’s student store is just a couple 
blocks away. 
There, students bought their white Penn 
State football shirts for Saturday’s “White 
Out.” I bought a short-sleeved one only to wish I had longer sleeves to fend off the 
60-degree weather.
I never made it into the stadium the next day, though. 
It wasn’t because of one too many Steel 
Reserves, but instead because of the lack of any tickets available at a reasonable price. 
To think students actually showed up in droves for a college football game? Florida student tickets are $15, while we couldn’t 
find one for less than $60 at Penn State — 
for UCF no less. 
Once Friday turned into Saturday, Col-
lege Ave. became the epicenter of Nittany Lion pride. 
Ticket scalpers worked the street cor-
ners, families headed for pregame meals and the cheerleading squad greeted fans with stickers. The scene reminded me of Knoxville’s 
crazed gameday atmosphere: a never-end-ing sight of burnt orange and long lines. 
We ate at The Corner Room, a State Col-
lege staple since 1926. 
After a breakfast buffet of bacon, eggs 
and danishes, the real fun began. Sidewalk 
space came at a premium as Penn Staters 
had tailgating on their minds.
My walks to The Swamp from my house 
by Emerson Alumni Hall have become less crowded — a sad sight for a storied 
Southeastern Conference program like UF. 
Although there may not be a better expe-rience than Penn State football, Florida’s should be less about the wins and losses, and more about the orange and blue.
Penn State lost to UCF on Saturday. 
The Knights shocked State College with its 
first-ever win against a Big 10 team. After 
the 34-31 upset, in true Penn State fashion, the crowd joined together in “Fight On, State.”
We left shortly after kickoff. We stum-
bled home away from the parking lot, away from Beaver Stadium, away from the Winnebago’s. 
As we exited the lot, cheers from Happy 
Valley could be heard and stale beer could be smelled. 
Together, they revealed a school spirit 
that never left. AdAm , from page 12Burke allowed first goal since Aug. 25 in tie

After surviving a scare from 
Western Michigan on Saturday, 
No. 5 Florida (8-1) has adjust-ments to make prior to facing No. 16 Florida State (6-3) on Tuesday. 
The Gators were able to beat the 
Broncos in four sets (25–21, 25–22, 28–30, 25–18) but were troubled by mental errors in the process. 
“It was tough because Western 
Michigan played so well,” coach Mary Wise said. “They passed nails. There was a point in the first set where they were passing, from 
a three-point scale, at a 2.7.”
During the third set, which the 
Broncos won on an attack error by 
sophomore outside hitter Gabby Mallette, the Gators failed to close out the match on four different oc-casions.  At the end of the third set, Flor-
ida had service errors from libero Taylor Unroe and defensive spe-cialist Holly Pole.  
Although the Broncos had al-
ready been swept twice this sea-son, they challenged the Gators by extending and winning points. 
Florida committed 13 service 
errors in the match and had to rely on quick points in order to over-come Western Michigan’s poise.
“It was a long weekend in gen-
eral,” Ziva Recek said. “We were tired by the end. We had to fin-ish strong and at the end we said, ‘OK, let us finish. Let us finish the game.’”
Throughout the weekend, UF 
was unable to finish off points. In the first game against Iona on Saturday, the Gators limited the Gaels to only 29 digs.  The Broncos kept more points 
alive by coming up with 63 digs. Not finishing kills could be a chal-lenge against a Florida State squad that boasts sisters Elise and Nicole Walch, who are each former Un-der Armour Girls High School All-America selections. 
In the Seminoles’ five-set victo-
ry against No. 7 Michigan on Sat-urday, each Walch sister recorded 22 kills. If Florida cannot finish points off early, it could lead to long rallies that benefit the quick-hitting duo. 
The key for UF will be the play 
of Recek. The Slovenia native was named the MVP of the Active 
Ankle Challenge aftern notching 
21 kills and 10 digs against the Broncos.

NFL agent Jon Perzley and 
Jermaine Cunningham are 
both UF alums, but it took a 
pair of shorts for the latter to 
realize the connection.
A Gators logo tattooed on 
Perzley’s right calf gave it 
away.
“I had seen this big Gator 
tattoo, and I was like, ‘What? 
Did you lose a bet?’” Cun-
ningham said, laughing. “He 
was like, ‘Nah, I’m a Gator.’ So I was like, ‘Ah, man. That’s even better.’”
The tattoo is the last rem-
nant of Perzley’s days attend-ing football games for leisure. He still spends his weekends at football stadiums, but his mindset has changed.
“It’s a lot of fun but don’t 
mistake it,” Perzley said. “It’s work.”
Gone are the days of 
cheering and tailgating. Per-zley, 30, only has eyes for his four fellow Gators — Cun-ningham, Lerentee McCray, 
Justin Trattou and Sharrif 
Floyd.
“I’m really not a fan,” Per-
zley said. “All I am is making sure my guys are doing well. 
It’s really hard to sit back and 
enjoy a game a football game now when all you’re doing is concentrating on your cli-
ents.”
Floyd, one of Perzley’s 
newer clients, presented the 
young agent with a unique challenge when the two first 
connected. Floyd declared 
for the NFL draft following his junior season and quickly earned buzz as a projected first-round pick. Floyd said 
Perzley was a calming pres-
ence among the distrac-tions that surrounded him throughout the pre-draft pro-cess.
“He put it really simple the 
way he did it,” Floyd said. 
“He just said, ‘You take 
care of what you can take 
care of as far as ball and leave 
the rest to me.’ I put every-thing in his hands as far as anything besides football and 
training and getting ready for 
the draft. He’s really good at what he does.”
With Perzley working be-
hind the scenes, Floyd went 
about his business of meeting 
with teams and focusing on workouts. Once the Minne-sota Vikings made Floyd the 
23rd overall selection of the 
2013 NFL Draft, both player and agent let out sighs of re-lief.
“The draft process is so stressful,” Perzley said. 
“There’s so much that goes 
into this that, when you’re finally drafted, you can kind of rest easy and know that, ‘Hey, now all this nonsense 
is over with. Now it’s time to 
go do what I love doing.’”
Floyd added: “We all 
came together after I came off the stage, and (Perzley said), 
‘Now it’s just time to go and 
play ball. Go do what they need you to do for them.’”
Floyd’s path to the NFL 
was much different than those of McCray and Trat-tou, two Perzley clients who didn’t hold up jerseys and shake hands with NFL com-
missioner Roger Goodell at 
Radio City Music Hall in New York City.
McCray cracked the Den-
ver Broncos’ roster as an un-drafted rookie but will sit out this season on injured reserve due to a high ankle sprain. 
Meanwhile, Trattou, a 
member of the New York Giants, continues to provide an example for undrafted rookies like McCray that hard work and persistence — 
when combined with talent 
— can help earn you a roster spot.
Trattou may not be a start-
er, but he has hung on as a valuable member of the Gi-ants’ defensive line rotation since beginning his profes-
sional career in 2011. He is 
thankful Perzley cared more about his drive than his draft stock.
“Going back to even when 
I was at Florida, a lot people said I wouldn’t ever play,” Trattou said. “Then I started [31] games there. Jon took no-
tice of that, and he believed 
in me from the get-go.”
Whether his clients are 
high draft picks like Floyd and Cunningham or under-
rated guys like McCray and 
Trattou, Perzley is in the business of fulfilling prom-
ise. If his clients are willing 
to work, he is prepared to do 
whatever it takes to get them 
where they want to go.
“There’s no better feeling 
in the world — that’s one of 
the reasons I love my job so 
much,” Perzley said. “Help-
ing guys fulfill this lifelong dream of playing in the 
NFL.”UF graduate now

The Gators secured their first trophy of the season 
during the weekend at Duke’s Fab Four invitational. 
Senior Sofie Oyen and freshman Belinda Woolcock 
won the doubles bracket at Duke’s Cary Tennis Center 
in North Carolina on Saturday.
Oyen and Woolcock defeated Duke’s Ester Goldfeld 
and Marianne Jodoin 8-7, 7-5 to claim UF’s first individ-ual title of the season.
“This was the best we’ve looked in doubles on the 
first day of the season in my 13 years at Florida,” Thorn-qvist said Friday. “We moved really well. Our commu-nication was excellent, and we were a constant threat at the net.”
Thornqvist added that he was especially pleased 
with Oyen and Woolcock, because the two had only one day of practice together prior to the match.
“I thought Sofie and Belinda played really good ten-
nis,” Thornqvist said. “They are doing it the right way. They are imposing their will on the other team.”
Also competing together for the first time were senior 
Olivia Janowicz and freshman Kourtney Keegan, who defeated Miami’s Kelsey Laurente and Stephanie Wag-ner 8-2. The pair lost a semifinal match to Alabama’s Erin Routliffe and Danielle Spielmann on Friday.
Oyen advanced to the final match of the singles draw 
but fell 6-2, 6-4 to UNC’s Haley Carter, the nation’s fourth-ranked freshman.  
On Sunday, Janowicz defeated 
Duke’s Ester Goldfeld in singles to win the third-place bracket. Goldfeld, No. 42 in the Intercollegiate Tennis Association’s preseason rankings, is the second-highest ranked opponent Janowicz has defeated in her career.
“The highlight may have been Ol-
ivia’s play,” Thornqvist said Sunday. 
“This is clearly the best I’ve seen Ol-
ivia play. She has much more weight on her ball.”
Keegan earned a victory against Duke’s No. 24 
Hanna Mar to take fifth place in her draw. Woolcock also earned a fifth-place spot by defeating William and Mary’s Leeza Nemchinov. 
“We’re making a few too many errors at this,” Thorn-
qvist said.

come.”Doubles pairing wins Fab Four invite“I had seen this big

Jimmy Clark runs at the Mountain Dew Invitational on 
Saturday in Gainesville. Clark won his race in 23:53.78.

Alligator Writer @GordonStreisand
On a dewy morning at the Mark Bo-
stick Golf Course, Florida’s cross country 
teams gave a sneak peek of this season’s Southeastern Conference Champion-ships in front of their home crowd.
For the women, it was a chance to 
show their prowess as reigning confer-ence champions. 
For the men, it was a chance to prove 
they could win a conference title for the first time in more than a quarter of a cen-tury. 
On Saturday, it was the men who stole 
the show, winning their eighth Mountain 
Dew Invitational in nine years. Junior 
Jimmy Clark won the men’s 8K with a time of 23:53.78 and senior Mark Parrish finished second almost 6 seconds later.  
“I was really happy with the men,” 
coach Paul Spangler said. “Mark Parrish and Jimmy Clark were both under 24 minutes, which is a really good time in this sport. Eddie Garcia had a great race. 
Carlos Miranda, first 8K as a freshman, 
was close to 25 flat, which is a great time for a freshman here. Very pleased with the guys right now.”
Clark shaved nearly a minute off his 
time of 24:50.63 from his seventh-place finish at last year’s Mountain Dew Invi-tational. 
“There was a lot better competition 
this year than last year,” Clark said. “We wanted to go out and make sure we de-fended our home course. I think we came back in better shape this year than we were last year.”
The opposite could be said for the 
women this time around. After sweeping the event last season, the women’s team finished third on Saturday. Florida’s top finisher was redshirt senior Agata Strau-
sa, who placed second after winning the 
meet last year. 
The drop-off from last season can be 
attributed to injuries. The Gators were 
without key seniors Stephanie Strasser 
and Shelby Hayes on Saturday. 
“The results on the women’s side are 
not indicative of what we’re capable of doing,” Spangler said. “Two of our top five girls were out because of injury, and that really hurt us from a team stand-point. That was disappointing, but we’ve got some time to get those girls healthy 
and run well when it counts as we get 
closer to SEC championships.”
The returns of Hayes, Strasser and 
Cory McGee will have a significant im-pact on the team’s chances of repeating as SEC champions. McGee is still easing her way back in after a summer compet-ing at nationals and worlds. 
“Those are our top runners,” Strausa 
said. 
“Cory is easing into it right now be-
cause she went to worlds and didn’t have the same summer workouts as the other 
(runners). Stephanie will be fit by (SECs) 
too. She’s battling an issue right now. We need those girls. They’re our strength.”
Added Spangler: “Steph Strasser and 
Shelby Hayes just have to get healthy. They should be fine. We just have to get them healthy and cross-trained until we feel like they’re able to get out there and compete. It’s disappointing they couldn’t 
go today and obviously that hurt us, 
team-scoring wise.”
The primary goal for the women 
moving forward will be to get healthy. When McGee, Strasser and Hayes are back in the fold, the Gators will have a strong chance of repeating as conference champions. 
For the men, it will be to maintain the 
upward trajectory currently being set by upperclassmen Clark, Parrish, Garcia and JL Hines. 
“(Saturday) was a huge confidence 
booster, not just for me, but for our entire team,” Clark said. 
“Everyone ran well. Almost everyone 
put in PR performances. We’re really ex-cited for the rest of the season.” UF men win Mountain Dew Invitational
“We wanted to go out and 
make sure we defended our 
home course. I think we came 
back in better shape this year 
than we were last year.”

Florida’s season opener at the 
Olympia Fields/Fighting Illini In-
vitational was a struggle. 
After battling course conditions 
during the first round, the Gators fell to 15th place and never recov-ered.
UF finished the tournament 
with a 905 (+15) to finish 14th in the field. No. 1 Alabama (+9) won the tournament. 
Coach Buddy Alexander said 
the course was difficult and the team’s nerves showed on the scoreboard. He added that with a young team, he expects better re-
sults as the season progresses.
Junior J.D. Tomlinson paced 
Florida after one round by shoot-
ing a 75 (+5). Tomlinson finished the tournament by shooting an even-par final round to end at 11-
over, which led the Gators and was 
tied for 29th overall.
“(Tomlinson) stepped up and 
played a really good round,” Alex-ander said in a release. “He played well in the green and hit quite a few good shots.”
After shooting 8-over in the first 
round, freshman Victor Tarnstrom 
recovered to finish with a pair of 4-over rounds. Tarnstrom (+16) finished 50th overall and second 
on Florida.
UF will now turn its attention 
to its next tournament, the Shoal Creek Intercollegiate, which be-gins Sept. 30 in Birmingham, Ala.
“We learned from this experi-
ence,” Alexander said. “It’s al-lowed us to see where we are and 
where we need to be.” Poor first round sinks Gators at season-opening event
