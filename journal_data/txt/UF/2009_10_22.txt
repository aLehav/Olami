Comedian jokes about disorder
By ALISON SCHWARTZ
Alligator Writer I1
Sometimes, it's hard to understand Louis
"Twitchels" Centanni.
His sentences are often broken up by throaty
grunts as he jerks his head back and forth. His
neck arches toward the ceiling and he recovers.
These are ticks, and if he focuses hard enough,
he can control them.
Centanni, 24, has Tourette syndrome, and in
front of about 100 UF students Wednesday eve-
ning, he tried to explain why his disability really
isn't so bad.
"It's not easy living like this," he said. "But I
don't like people who look for pity."
He wasn't always so optimistic.
One day, he found himself in his bedroom,
sulking about his condition. He wrapped an ex-
tension cord around his neck, double-knotting
the loop and attaching it to his bunk bed. All of
the twitching, the teasing, the ticks -he was
ready to end it.
He was also 250 pounds. His suicide attempt
broke his bunk bed and snapped the cord.
"I'm like, 'I can't even fucking kill myself,"'
Centanni joked.
It's jokes like these that summarize Centanni's
outlook. He channels struggles with his disability
into his entertainment career, and he's not afraid
to make fun of himself.
"I just love entertainment in general," Centan-
ni said. "It's the best medicine for me."
Centanni has appeared on "True Life," "The
Tonight Show" with Jay Leno, "The Simple Life"
and a music video.

Comedian Louis Centanni speaks about his experiences with Tourette syn-
drome in the Rion Ballroom at the Reitz Union on Wednesday night.
Professor's charges may be dropped
Police caught him
A UF associate anthropology profes-
sor charged with cocaine possession for
an incident in January has entered into
an agreement with the State Attorney's
office.
Under the pretrial intervention
agreement, Michael Heckenberger must
perform 50 hours of community ser-
vice and take random drug and alcohol
screenings, among other penalties.
If he follows the conditions of the
12-month agreement, which was signed
last month, the charge will be dropped.
Heckenberger was arrested Jan. 17ditching cocaine
after an officer saw him toss a bag into
the street, according to a police report.
The substance in the bag tested posi-
tive for cocaine, but
Heckenberger told
police it wasn't his.
He said he was
curious" and want-
ed to trade it for
sexual favors from
Heckenberger a man he had been
standing with, ac-
cording to the report.
He was placed on paid leave after thearrest but was reinstated this semester,
according to UF spokesman Steve Or-
lando.
Heckenberger was arrested four days
after a judge cut short his probation pe-
riod for a reckless driving charge.
After being pulled over by an of-
ficer in January of 2008, Heckenberger
told the arresting officer he had had few
beers and refused to perform field so-
briety tests or submit a breath sample.
After pleading no contest, he agreed
to pay almost $600 in fines and court
costs, perform community service and
submit to random drug and alcohol
tests.

A wanted Georgia man was arrest-
ed by Gainesville police for stealing
more than $6,000 worth of cigarettes
and Steel Reserve beer from a Chev-
ron early Wednesday morning.
After leaving the Chevron, 3845
NE 15th St., 41-year-old Oscar Tellez
drove east and was peeking inside
the Citgo at 1606 NW 13th St. from
his truck when police spotted him,
GPD spokesman Keith Kameg said.
When officer Ariel Lugo ap-
proached Tellez, he jumped into his
truck and drove away.
Police dog K-9 Justice found Tellez
hiding at the CVS construction site
on Northwest 16th Avenue, Kameg
said.
Entering a construction site with-
out permission is a felony offense.
"When you refuse to come out
of a situation and we give you am-
ple warning, we will send our dogs
out 100 percent of the time," Kameg
said.
Police found the stolen items from
the Chevron inside Tellez's truck,
which was stolen in Georgia.
According to Kameg, there have
been similar gas station thefts, which
police believe may be connected to
Tellez and are under investigation.
Tellez was charged with grand
theft auto, loitering and prowling,
trespassing on construction site, flee-
ing and attempting to elude, resisting
arrest without violence and driving
without a license.

Microsoft employee discusses Windows 7 at UF Hilton
By DAVID TINTNER
Alligator Contributing Writer
Windows Vista caused more
than a few headaches.
In fact, Matt Morris, a technol-
ogy strategist for Microsoft, said
when he would go to the airport,
he had to travel incognito.
Once, he was waiting to go
through security when a woman in
line behind him saw his Microsoft
shirt and told him she was havingall sorts of problems with her com- "I think Wi ndows 7 is a win-
puter.
"Boy, Vista really sucks," she
said to him.
But Morris and the rest of Mi-
crosoft's employees hope that soon
they can travel in peace.
Microsoft released its newest
operating system, Windows 7, to-
day, and Morris presented it to
about 35 people Wednesday at the
UF Hilton on 34th Street.
"Vista was such a huge changener from what I've seen."
Stephen Flowers
vice president of Scan Technology
Inc.
in so many ways," Morris said.
"You can think of Windows 7 as a
refinement."
Morris also expects to see a
change in the way Windows 7 sells.In the past, most people just used
the operating system that came
with their computer and did not
buy the upgrade, he said.
Test versions have been avail-
able to a limited market for almost
six months.
Many UF students have already
started testing and using Windows
7, said Randy Switt, an IT adminis-
trator for the College of Engineer-
ing.
Switt said one of the featuresthat is most beneficial is enhanced
security.
Microsoft is offering Windows 7
to students for the reduced price of
$29.99 until Jan. 3, 2010. The regu-
lar retail price is $119.99.
Stephen Flowers, vice presi-
dent of Scan Technology Inc., said
his company is interested in using
Windows 7 in the future.
"I think Windows 7 is a win-
ner from what I've seen," Flowers
said.

Reitz may
remove
asbestos
from hotel
By CAROLYN TILLO
Alligator Writer
The Reitz Union is starting to
feel the effects of its old age, and
asbestos is one of them.
Executive Director Eddie Dan-
iels gave a presentation at Tuesday
night's Student Senate meeting
describing maintenance repairs of
the Reitz Union, which would cost
about $42.5 million over the next
15 years.
One necessary repair includes
removing asbestos above the
ceilings, in the hot water piping
and in the duct work of the Reitz
Union Hotel.
The total cost of removing the
asbestos, which lies undisturbed
in the building's walls, would be
about $120,000.
Unite Party Sen. Kara Olesky
said she did not
feel comfortable
knowing that as-
bestos was pres-
ent in the hotel's
walls and feared
for the health of
hotel guests.
Ossip Bill Burton,
an environmen-
tal health and safety specialist at
UF, said asbestos only becomes
dangerous if it is disturbed dur-
ing construction or renovations of
buildings. Then, the fibers are re-
leased into the air and could cause
health problems for the people
who breathe them in.
Although the asbestos does not
pose an immediate threat, Daniels
said its removal is high on his list
of priorities.
He said the hotel budget should
be able to handle the cost of the re-
moval, but he is unsure how the
Reitz Union will pay for other re-
pairs, including replacing one of
the building's main transformers
and making the lighting system
more energy efficient.
"So, you know, I don't have
easy answers right now, especially
in these economic times," Daniels
said.
He said the union would have
to rely on Student Activity and Ser-
vice fees and the money it makes
from vendors and food sales.
Orange and Blue Party Sen. Jon
Ossip said the asbestos removal
was not high on his priority list
because he would rather see the
union become more energy effi-
cient.
He said the $150,000 senators
voted to give to the administration
at Tuesday's meeting should have
been used for Reitz Union repairs.Feed your future

Video store struggles against change
By EMILY HANSON
Alligator Contributing Writer
The fishbowl on the front desk at Video
Rodeo overflows with cut up Blockbuster
cards, some cut in half and others cut into
shapes like dinosaurs.
The walls are adorned with posters for
movies you've probably never heard of.
Video Rodeo, a locally owned rental
store, opened its doors in December 2004
to supply Gainesville with nontraditional
media. Five years later, the business is
fighting to stay afloat while Nefflix and
Redbox threaten to make video stores a
thing of the past.
Roger Beebe, a UF film studies profes-
sor, said he decided to open the store after
living in Gainesville for four years and felt
a need for an alternative video store.
Beebe, 37, said he set up his store as a
reaction to the cash cow mentalities of big
business video stores like Blockbuster and
Video Gallery.
At Video Rodeo, if a customer cuts up
their Blockbuster card, he or she receives a
free rental.
The store started with Beebe's personal
collection of DVDs and VHS tapes and hasgrown to a selection of more than 5,500
films.
Beebe said he picks which new DVDs to
purchase through research and with help
from his staff.
There is also a suggestion book on the
front desk where patrons can scribble in
titles of movies they want to see, give feed-
back on movies they hated and sometimes
just doodle.
"It's great going to a video store
that's all video and very little
store."
Customers like Jamie
sophomore, appreciate th
ees spend trying to help
movie.
"It's great going to a vi
all video and very little store
Beebe said he thinks tha
customers on a personal lev
them loyal.
One regular has even
from Micanopy to rent vidBut despite this loyalty, Beebe said the
store isn't a profitable business.
"We're not as afloat as one might think,"
he said.
Local businesses can't compete with
services like Nefflix and the convenience of
the Internet, he said.
And Redbox DVD rental machines,
which are placed in grocery stores and
malls, also pose a threat.
Beebe said to stay open, the store oper-
ates on a system of collective ownership.
Incoming money is used to pay the bills
and any remaining profit is split between
the employees.
Jamie Miann If money gets even tighter, there's a
UF sophomore plan B: Use volunteer workers who will get
unlimited rentals instead of paychecks.

Editorial
In Denial
Insurers shouldn't
restrict victims' coverage
et's just come out and say it -the health care system
in America has really seen better days. From insurers
booting sick people to the curb to the elderly having to
choose between food and much-needed prescription drugs,
the States definitely lag behind the rest of the developed world
in providing health care regardless of age or socioeconomic
status.
Record numbers of Americans now go without health in-
surance altogether, while obesity is on the rise and healthy
lifestyles are harder and harder to come by as dollar cheese-
burgers become more appealing than healthy home-cooked
meals amid the current economic turmoil.
This is all common knowledge. Watch any cable news
channel for more than 10 minutes and it's clear that these are
the issues people are talking about. But there are also stories
out there that go untold, stories that frame the issues in the
most appalling way.
We would like to draw your attention to Christina Tucker.
What she went through is enough to make any woman think
twice before accepting a drink from a stranger, but not neces-
sarily for the obvious reasons.
Yes, 45-year-old Tucker went out on the town and was
given drinks by two men. The drinks were drugged, and the
men took her home and raped her. She doesn't remember
what happened because she was unconscious, but she does
remember waking up bruised and cut on the side of a Fort
Lauderdale road the next morning.
Sounds like a cautionary tale of the worst that can happen
to a woman on a night out. But the story does not end there.
Tucker wanted to make sure she was protected, so she de-
cided to take a medication that would reduce her chances of
contracting HIV from the encounter. She took the drugs for a
month and never developed the virus.
But once she lost her insurance and had to apply for a new
policy, the underwriters began digging into her past. They dis-
covered her history with the antiviral drugs and started asking
questions. Prying. Bringing her back to that night and those
horrible memories. And after it was all finished, she was de-
nied coverage.
They said she had a pre-existing condition. As if being
raped was the same as having skin cancer or a heart condition.
She was violated in the worst way possible and then forced to
relive that experience -all for the ability to avoid going bank-
rupt if she ever had to go back to the hospital, for any reason.
We find this beyond appalling. As Obama's health care re-
form bill stalls in Congress, amid partisan bickering and fili-
bustering, these insurance companies are getting away with
treating people like Tucker like garbage.
And a more sickening fact is that Tucker is not alone. Ac-
cording to an investigative report by the Huffington Post, this
is a widespread problem. Women who have histories of tak-
ing these kind of preventative drugs after sexual assaults not
only have trouble securing coverage, but those who manage
to get lucky enough to stay covered often face riders and ex-
clusions on their policies that force them to pay out-of-pocket
for such necessities as gynecological exams, reproductive care
and emotional counseling. These women continue to be pun-
ished for something they didn't have anything to do with in
the first place.
This is disgusting, and hopefully as the story of Tucker
spreads and more women come forward with their stories, the
frustratingly slow process of change will gain some momen-
him. Women in this country deserve it.

Fighting could resolve health care issues
mid a thorny nest of substantive issues andthoughtful debate about human agency, America
proved last week that our real gift to the world is a
bountiful supply of vaguely Asian, dysfunctional families
ready to claw their way onto television. Our nation owes
you a great deal of gratitude, Heene and Gosselin clans,
for too many seem to have forgotten that our country was
built on a burning desire to have one's own reality televi-
sion show.
Our forefathers, in their infinite wisdom, carefully
wrote out a Constitution that never once mentioned
anything about limiting our access to reality television
programming. Far be it from me to place words in the
mouths of such venerated figures, but I know deep in
my heart that Thomas Jefferson would own every season
of "Jon and Kate Plus 8" on Blu-Ray -and Benjamin
Franklin was rumored to have written a treatment that
almost exactly paralleled the "balloon boy" saga.
As a strict constitutionalist, only the text that survives
from the late 1700s guides my principles and decision-
making. However, due to the inherent difficulties of
writing with quills and the less-than-stellar preservation
techniques of the day, some important guidelines never
made it to the narrow scope of today's interpretational-
ist. I think somebody spilled some tea on the dang thing,
too.
While not exactly ratified back in the day, the health
care system in America was from our national incep-
tion always inextricably linked with cage fighting. James
Madison was a huge MMA fan, and his influence among
other members of the Constitutional Convention almost
got the cage fighting/health care amendment added to
our Constitution at the last second. Were it not for thepansies from Delaware and New
Hampshire, our long national de-
bate would have been over in the
time it takes to apply a juji-gatame
arm bar.
It may sound radical to some,
Tommy Maple but the most traditional and con-letters@alligator org servative way we can clear up this
health care conundrum is to have
the Heenes and Gosselins settle the debate in the octa-
gon. Obviously, the Gosselins would be fighting on be-
half of Obamacare -they got in-vitro done twice and ac-
cept more handouts than your average street beggar. The
Heenes will fight for our current system of individual re-
sponsibility, as building a huge UFO balloon and being
an overbearing jerkwad both take serious persistence.
Just like the current health care debate, this fighting
solution would be confusing and emotionally draining.
The Heenes are quiet and skinny, but years of living with
a clearly psychotic patriarch has made them tougher than
a two-dollar steak.
However, after a few rounds of toying with her hu-
man prey, Kate Gosselin would turn back into Queen of
the Harpies and wear Falcon's innards like a hat.
We could keep arguing about these issues, or we
could solve them in a way that would make our found-
ing fathers proud. The fight would make great TV, too
-though maybe not quite as good as "So You Think You
Can Overthrow the Shackles of an Oppressive Foreign
Government?" or "America's Next Top Powdered Wig
Maker."

munications. His column appears on Thursdays.

Public option not only solution
oseph Trimboli makes some good points in
his letter to the editor, "People entitled to
health care," until he says anyone who op-
oses the public option is either being paid off
by the insurance companies or enjoys killing
their fellow Americans.
He cast his argument in the same league as
Sarah Palin's death panels at that point. There
is legitimate opposition to every issue, and the
public option is no different.
You can want universal health care and still
decry the public option as potentially ineffi-
cient, expensive or as an unnecessary expan-
sion in government at the cost of our liberty.Warren Rhea Universal health care
Speaking Out need not require a pub-
lic option. You could just
more strictly regulate the
insurance companies we already have, as well
as the doctors themselves, and get systems
much like most of those in Western Europe, in
which private companies still do the heavy lift-
ing under the stern regulations of their national
governments.But to argue that anyone who otherwise dis-
agrees with the public option wants to kill their
fellow Americans is, well, pretty un-American.

Form Number: 18533-599SU 3669 S.W. 2nd AvenueGovernment can't solve all
problems
When I was growing up, duct tape
was the solution to all problems.
We used duct tape to fix things
that broke in half, repair hoses and
cover textbooks. Now, there is a new
solution to all of life's problems: gov-
ernment.
Bought a house you can't afford?
Let government fix it. Used a credit
card to buy more than you can pay
back? Let government fix it. Can't af-
ford a new car? Let government sub-
sidize you. Can't save money for re-
tirement yourself? Let government do
it. Can't afford your own health care?
Let government provide it for you.
People everywhere are becoming
increasingly dependent on the gov-
ernment every day as government
tries to solve all the world's prob-
lems.
As we talk of increasing obesity,
the government's proposed solution
is to tax soda. As people continue
to kill themselves by smoking, the
university decides to ban tobacco on
campus.
The point is simple, what the
government can provide, it can take
away, which is why Thomas Paine
described government as a necessary
evil.
It might be best to listen to the
words of Thomas Jefferson, who said
simply, "Never trouble another for
what you can do for yourself." You
can get yourself in shape and stop
smoking.
You can buy your own house/
apartment, food, and health care and
only if you can't should you trouble
the government. The majority of
Americans have or could afford in-
surance, or qualify for Medicaid,which means the government should
stay out of it.

Congress shouldn't be trusted
The Oct. 6 Gallup poll reports that
only 21 percent of Americans approve
of the job Congress is doing. Consid-
ering that so few people support the
effort being made by congressmen, it
seems obvious that Congress is failing
to represent the will of the people.
Now let's think about a 21 percent
approval rating of an auto mechanic
we'll call Bob. If only 21 percent of
Bob's clients approved of the job he
did, would you feel comfortable hir-
ing Bob to fix your car? If you are
aware that nearly 80 people of Bob's
clients disapprove of the work he did
on their cars, people would call you
crazy if you decided to have him do
work on your car.
It's common sense. If you would
normally avoid taking your car to
Bob's garage, wouldn't you also
avoid giving your money or power to
an entity that is viewed as a failure by
80 percent of the population?
I am writing this as a response to
those who insist that a public option
is the only way to solve our nation's
health care crisis. Of course, some-
thing needs to be done about escalat-
ing health care costs but does Con-
gress really know what is best?
With such an appallingly low ap-
proval rating and a track record of
irresponsible spending, I find them
incompetent and undeserving of our
trust.

Modern Skirts builds its reputation with 'indie scene
By JOEY FLECHAS
avenue contributing writer
Athens, Ga., has a rich indie
rock history peppered with acts
like Of Montreal, Drive-By Truckers,
Neutral Milk Hotel and the two pa-
tron saints of the scene, the B-52s
and R.E.M.
Alternative popsters Modern
Skirts, armed with airy keyboards
and dreamy melodies, are some
of the newer kids on the block who
are building a reputation in the in-
die scene.
The group will be playing its sec-
ond show in Gainesville this month
on Wednesday at 9 p.m. at 1982.
The Old Ceremony, The Neighbor-
hood Watch, and Brother Captain
and King will also be performing.
Tickets are $6.
Drummer John Swint said that
being from Athens helps grab theattention of music fans even if they
haven't heard any of the band's
music.
"It's actually pretty cool," he
said. "It's kind of a good badge to
wear."
The folklore of Athens indepen-
dent music has even played a sig-
nificant part in the development
of the band over the six years it's
been together. They've been able
to play legendary venues like the
40 Watt Club, grabbing the atten-
tion of R.E.M. bassist Mike Mills
one night when he happened to be
there to catch a gig.
Mills enjoyed the show so much
he went backstage to meet the
band, leaving the group floored,
Swint said.
"He's so down to earth, you real-
ly forget what an icon he is," Swint
said.
Mills eventually offered his ser-vices as a producer and backup
singer for one of the tracks off of
the band's latest album, "All of Us
in Our Night."
The band has been touring off
of that record, which the band re-
leased independently last October.
"'W'' 3o down to earth, you
really forget what an icon he
is."
JOHN SWINT
drummer
For Swint, the do-it-yourself aes-
thetic can become a double-edged
sword in a world that is full of here-
today, gone-tomorrow YouTube and
MySpace phenomenons.
"It's a really cool time to be cre-
ative because there are so many
outlets, but you really have to stay
on top of the wave. You have tocompete with Joe Blow in his living
room, making beats for T-Pain," he
said. "It's really exciting and really
scary at the same time."
The music from "All of Us in
Our Night" is laced with a wintery
dreariness that reflects some of
the atmosphere that surrounded
half of the recording sessions in a
cold Richmond, Va., studio a few
years ago.
The other half of the sessions
took place in New Orleans during
Mardi Gras. Swint noted the influ-
ence these surroundings had on
the track "Radio Breaks."
An impromptu parade of locals
banging screwdrivers on metal
cans led to the creation of the
song's brassy coda.
"We actually got some teenag-
ers, and we gave them an allow-
ance to come up and play horns,"
he said.The record took so long to actu-
ally put out that it has already be-
come somewhat of an afterthought
to the group.
They have already recorded 12
new songs, a batch of tunes that
Swint says marks a new direction
for the band.
"The songs that we are currently
working on are a little more cohe-
sive," he said.
If the band likes what it's done,
it hopes to put out a new album by
early next year. Modern Skirts have
played to crowds both in the U.S.
and in Europe, traveling last sum-
mer to England to play at the Glas-
tonbury Festival.
The band is returning to play in
Gainesville, a town that Swint said
has a familiar feel to it.
"It's a lot like Athens-huge col-
legiate crowd and a solid scene,"
he said.

Q&A
By JON SILMAN
avenue writer
The cast of the new Comedy Cen-
tral show "Secret Girlfriend" wantto be
your best friends, literally. The show is
shot in an unheard of first-person view,
and you are the main character.
You party with your bros Sam (Mi-
chael Blaiklock) and Phil (Derek Mill-
er), and you try to juggle two equally
hot girls, Mandy (Alexis Krause) and
Jessica (Sara Fletcher), while simulta-
neously hiding them from each other.
The Avenue caught up with the cast
to chat about the show.
+ I heard something about
this show being previously on
the Internet. Was it the same
show?
Derek: Well, guys could download
these "Secret Girlfriend" clips and
kind of get to pretend that, you know,
at their leisure that they have their girl-
friends in their pocket kind of a thing.
It took us a lot of tinkeringto bring it to
television.to make it an actual narra-
tive story and things like that.
+ What's been your favorite
moment from the show so far?
Mike: For me, it's the variety of
things that we gotto do. I mean we did
ball wars, we gotto work in front of the
beach, we shot a rap video on a boat.
We got to be in an airplane skydiving.
So you actually skydived? It
was real?
Derek: No, the plane was on the
ground the whole time, but we got to
go in a plane. I mean I really enjoyed
just being able to go to places.with the cast of "Secret Girlfriend"
* On the show, you guys are
the ultimate bros. .Do you have
friends like that in real life?
Mike: I think back in my mid-20s I
think I definitely had a group that re-
sembled something like Sam and Phil
with the same aspiration. But I think
they've all kind of grown up now and
figured themselves out.
* Have either of you ever had
girlfriends like Alexis' character?
Derek: I've had a couple of psy-
chos. And I'm sure those types of girls
exist out there. But I've had a couple
of psychos where you're just like "Ahh.
What are you thinking? What's in your
head?"
* This is a really fast-paced
show. Do you think that the
show, being so fast-paced,
hinders the character develop-
ment?
Mike: I mean, I think because you
have to experience everything in the
first person, too, you don't get to expe-
rience the characters in their private
moments really unless you're spying
on them, so it kind of keeps us from
being a little more fleshed outthan on
your average show.
* You guys are essentially
acting with a cameraman. Now,
is it the same cameraman every
time?
Derek: That was a thingthat I think
Ross, our director, really wanted to
have. Somebody who was consistent
through the whole thing and then
we feel comfortable with him being
that other character, you know, so,
that was by no mistake. Especially

Contact us at [352] 376.4482.'cause you know it gets sort of inti-

need someone who is cool with that.
+ What's your comedic inspi-
ration for your characters that
you play on the show?
Alexis: Of course I couldn't pull any-
thingfrom myown experience, butl had
to incorporate bits and pieces of per-
sonality traits from friends that I know.
+ There's a scene with you
playing the guitar nude. Was that
a hard scene to film?
Alexis: No it wasn't. First of all, I
wasn't actually naked. The guitar was
strategically placed. I just wish I knew
a little bit more chords to actually play
through the song.
+ Sarah, your character on
the show seems to be like every
guy's dream girl, you know, fun,
into video games, likes to drink
beer. Are you really like that?
Sarah: I would say that Jessica is
a cooler version of me. [girls laugh-
ing] I don't know when the last time I
threw a kickball in someone's face. It
may have been like second-grade play-
ground action. I would definitely say
she's maybe shades of me. But she's
way cooler than me.
+ What's the most challeng-
ing thing about filming "Secret
Girlfriend?"
Alexis: I would say that fact that we
don't have a main character to react
off of is the hardest thing about filming
the show. We're always taught not to
look into the camera when you're act-
ing and, of course, in this instance you
always are.Good porn proves
hard to create
By ERIK VOSS
avenue writer
Never take good porn for
granted.
At age 14, pornography was
surprisingly difficult to come by.
While my friends satisfied their
hormonal curiosities with down-
loaded Japanese "hentai" pic-
tures and the overacted moans
of late-night Cinemax, my glacial
modem and standard cable
package left my sexual fantasies
uninspired.
In my desperation, I resorted
to drawing pictures of naked
women by hand. The task re-
quired artistic talent and imagi-
nation, skills that were destroyed
by a clumsy hand and a child-
hood in front of the television.
But I figured if cavemen could
survive without Cinemax, so
could I.
My homemade porn reached
the quality of prohibition-era
moonshine. The early drafts fea-
tured grotesque mutants with
long necks, tiny heads and enor-
mous breasts, which, according
to their erased and redrawn cir-
cumferences, were never quite
big enough.
The exhibitionists didn't have
much to hide atthat point. Some-
times I'd attempt a sexy conver-
sation, but my lack of imagina-
tion led to shallow responses:
"I'm not wearing any clothes,"
they'd tell me flatly. "Why, you're
absolutely right. My boobs could
be bigger."
It's unsettling to rememberthese freaks as my first sexual
fantasies.
I imagine future anthropolo-
gists wouldn't think too highly
of me should they uncover the
crude hieroglyphics.
"Ah, it appears he disfigured
women's genitalia," they'd con-
clude. "That, combined with
his low muscle mass, probably
account for his dying sad and
alone."
Even at their sexiest, the
sketches never aroused me. Like
tickling myself with a feather or
baking my own birthday cake,
drawing my own pornography
justfelt selfish and predictable.
I missed the outsourced vari-
ety's element of surprise:
"I can't believe she just took
her bra off!
Best Friday
night ever!"
The more
I tried to be
Pygmalion,
the more I
became Dr.
Moreau. Oftentimes I decided a
patient was beyond saving and
crumbled the paper.
"You can't just leave me
without a face!" they'd sob. "I
hope your mother finds me."
The fear of being exposed
ultimately led me to shred the
collection.
At least now I know pornog-
raphy doesn't work like IKEA
furniture.
Crafting beauty is something
best left up to the experts: God
or plastic surgeons.

Any girl who has been out of
Florida and in a Hennes & Mau-
ritz store knows it's a fashionista's
dream -wall-to-wall clothing and
accessories at affordable prices.
You don't need to plan expensive
road trips or dreamy wish lists any-
more. H&M has arrived.
Two stores opened on Thurs-
day, one in Orlando in the Florida
Mall and one in Sanford in the
Seminole Towne Center, marking
the Swedishwclothing company's
double entrance into the state.
Both stores offer a variety of
clothing appealingto every type of
style and age group, from children
to adults.
H&M continuously rolls out new
designs throughout the season,
keeping up with the trends and al-
lowing for a variety of fresh looks.
The store's pieces, ranging from
basic T-shirts and wardrobe essen-
tials to special guest designer piec-
es from Matthew Williamson and
Comme des Gargons, stay within
reasonable prices. Women's ba-
sics like tunics and cotton dressesrange from about $15 to $25.
On Nov. 14, H&M plans to fea-
ture guest designer Jimmy Choo's
collection of shoes and handbags
ranging from $99 to $129, much
less than the designer's usual
price tag of $400 or more. Accord-
ing to the H&M Web site, Choo's
guest collection will feature stiletto
sandals as well as toe-less suede
booties and clutch purses in zebra
and black leather styles, in perfect
timing for the holiday season.
The store's fall and winter col-
lections also offer a variety of in-
demand items like leather skirts
and jackets, brocade dresses,
oversized knits in muted colors
such as tans, grays and powdery
pinks, and sequined pieces.
Paired with a complete acces-
sory line featuring suede ankle
booties, feathered hair pieces and
faux fur outerwear, outfits are cre-
ated in a cinch.
With fresh coats of paint on
their walls and desired fashions on
their racks, the two new H&M loca-
tions are located smack in the cen-
ter of the state, making that shop-
ping road trip even more worth the
while and the buck.

Florida feeling pressure in quest for repeat title
0 UF RETURNED 18 STARTERS
BUT HAS STRUGGLED AT TIMES.
By MIKE DIFERDINANDO
Alligator Staff Writer
mdiferdinando@alligator org
Things are starting to get a little
tight around the Florida football pro-
gram following Saturday's 23-20 vic-
tory over Arkansas.
"(There is) a lot of pressure on this
team to perform on a very high level -
on these coaches, on the trainers, on the
weight coaches, on the secretaries, on
everyone associated with our program,
a lot of pressure," coach Urban Meyer
said. "And I love that."
With 21 of their top 22 players on de-
fense and seven offensive starters com-
ing back, a trip to a third national title
game in four years almost looked like
a foregone conclusion for the Gators in
the preseason.
But at the halfway point of the sea-
son, things seem to be a little more un-
certain for UF (6-0, 4-0 Southeastern
Conference).
Without a reliable passing attack,
the Gators have leaned heavily on therun -specifically Tim Tebow.
The quarterback leads Florida in
rushing attempts this year with 99 and
has carried the ball more than running
backs Jeff Demps and Chris Rainey
combined (94).
The Gators have a minus 2 turnover
differential on the season and rank 76th
in the nation in red-zone efficiency.
Duringlastyear'schampionship run,
Florida scored 91 percent of the time in
the red zone, coming
away with touchdowns
75 percent of the time.
UF's red-zone efficiencyFootball has dropped to 80 per-
cent this year, and the
Gators are scoring touchdowns just 50
percent of the time.
UF failed to score from inside op-
ponent's 20-yard line just six times
last year. It has already matched that
through six games this season.
"I see guys pressing," Meyer said.
"I feel it around the office. We want to
play perfect because the expectation
level is to play at an extremely high
level."
Florida lost eight fumbles all of last
SEE FOOTBALL, PAGE 17Andrew Stanfill / Alligator Staff
UF coach Urban Meyer doesn't mind the expectations that come along with being a perennial
national power but admitted he has seen his team pressing at times.
Gators running game needs
fixing, but coach is in denial
Florida's running game seems tobe living by the motto, "If it ain't
broke, don't fix it."
That type of thinking will get them
in trouble, though.
If your roof has a crack in it, are you
going to leave it until the whole thing
caves in on you?
The Gators' running game has a crack
in it, and it is a matter of time before it
gives way unless changes are made.
Florida's rushing attack has carried
it so far this season, and with a trio of
backs and Tim Tebow at quarterback,
there's no reason it shouldn't be count-
ed on to take this team to the national
championship.
However, the ground game hasn't
looked as explosive as it did early on,
and it seems to be getting predictable.
UF offensive coordinator Steve Add-
azio doesn't agree with that statement.a
Bobby Callovi
Bobby's World
bcallovi@aIligator org"We're pretty
creative with the
run game," Add-
azio said. "We
were the No. 1
rushing team in
America."
The key word
in that statement
being "were."
Florida has dropped out of the top
spot and moved down to ninth and has
Auburn and Alabama nipping at its
heels for best in the Southeastern Con-
ference.
The Tigers already have better rush-
ing numbers in conference games than
the Gators, averaging 269 yards in
their four SEC games compared to the
Gators' average of 224.8.

UF adds high-profile tourney
By ANTHONY CHIANG
Alligator Writer
achiang@alligator org
After playing one of the toughest non-
conference schedules in school history this
season, the Gators decided it wasn't quite
hard enough.
Coach Mary Wise announced Monday
that Florida, Penn State, Texas and Stan-
ford have agreed in principal to participate
in a four-team tournament for the next four
seasons.
Each school will have the chance to host
the event, but the inaugural tournament in
2010 is scheduled to take place Sept. 10-11
in the O'Connell Center.
"It's a great opportunity for our team
for the next four years to play against some
of the best players in the country," Wise
said. "All four teams have been at the top
of the nation in terms of attendance, so we
know it will be well attended and a great
volleyball atmosphere."
The four teams have made a combined
37 NCAA Final Four appearances and are
all currently ranked in the top 15. Last sea-
son's Final Four included the three teamsjoining UF in the event.
Playing teams of this caliber early on in
the season will help the Gators prepare for
postseason play. Texas and Stanford are
the last two teams to knock UF out of the
NCAA Tournament, while Penn State has
won 84 matches in a row and is coming off
a 2008 national championship.
"We had a tough
nonconference schedule
this year and it's going to
be tougher next year, so
it's all good for us do
the road in December,"
sophomore Kelly Mur-
phy said.
Wis e hen Penn State
coach Russ Rose came
up with the idea for the tournament, he
didn't have a problem pitching it to the
other coaches.
"I thought there were a couple of
schools that I would like to play over a
four-year period, so I called all three of
those schools and all three of those coach-
es were in agreement that it was a great

SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE
Mullen will face former team in primetime matchup
By PHIL KEGLER
Alligator Staff Writer
pkegler@a Iligator org
Few breakups are this nice.
The departure of former Florida
offensive coordinator Dan Mullen
seems to be the exception. Mul-
len took the Mississippi State head
coaching gig in December and
jumped on a plane to Starkville mere
days after a winning a national title
with the Gators.
This fall is the first time since
1998 that Mullen and Urban Meyer
will not share a sideline.
The duo first crossed paths at
Notre Dame, where Meyer was a
wide receivers coach and Mullen
was a graduate assistant.
When Meyer left to take the head
coaching job at Bowling Green in
2001, he brought along Mullen to be
his quarterbacks coach. They stayed
together for two years there, spent
two years at Utah and then the last
four in Gainesville.
"The thing that makes Dan
unique is he's very, very smart,"
Meyer said. "I mean like really
smart and has a great awareness of
the game of football.
"We hit it off pretty good pretty
early. He's very intellectual as far as
understanding the game."
Mullen was with Meyer through
four conference championships and
two national titles, but the 37-year-
old is about to give UF's coach an-
other first. Five of Meyer's former
assistants now have a team of their
own, but Saturday will be Meyer's
first showdown with a former co-hort.
"A lot of guys have ambition to
be a head coach. You get a chance to
be a head coach in the Southeastern
Conference, I'm not sure anybody
in the country would've turned that
down," Meyer said. "So much of
taking a job is your vision with theathletic director and expectation lev-
els.
"When I talked to Dan, that was
my No. 1 thing -could you recruit
and is this AD a real guy? Does
this AD live in a different word, or
does he understand what it takes
and all that? One thing about Dan,he's very smart. He's not just gonna
make emotional decisions."
Mullen's move to Starkville also
upset another close relationship -
that of him and a particular Heis-
man Trophy winner.
Tim Tebow and his former quar-
terbacks coach were very close,

Mississippi State coach Dan Mullen spent the last eight years working for Florida coach Urban Meyer.
Saturday will be the first time Meyer faces a former assistant coach who went on to be a head coach.and the pair still talk, according to
Tebow, although their busy sched-
ules hinder communication. Mul-
len called to wish Tebow well after
his concussion during the Kentucky
game, and they make a point of text
messaging before and after each
other's games.
Tebow said it wasn't even that
hard to watch Mullen go because he
was so happy for him.
"I knew he wanted a head coach-
ing job. Not that he didn't like being
here, (but) he wanted that next goal,
that next task. The next thing that he
could go out there and accomplish,
and that was being a head coach,"
Tebow said. "If anything, I was hap-
py for him to get it, too, because he
had earned it with his coaching here
and his reputation."
While Mullen will be the headlin-
er of this coaching matchup, he also
took with him former UF tight ends
coach John Hevesy to be Mississippi
State's offensive line coach.
Florida junior Aaron Hernandez
remembers getting a message from
his former position coach to call him.
Hevesy then told him he would be
moving to Starkville.
"At first, you're frustrated be-
cause you're so close and you're
with them more than you are with
your family at home," Hernandez
said. "You are definitely mad at first,
but you know it's the best decision
for them.
"We basically considered each
other as family, but he had to go
make money or whatever he's doing
over there. It was the best decision
for him."

idea," he said.
The tournament is tentatively scheduled to
be hosted by Texas for the second season, then
it will move to Stanford for the third year, and
Penn State will host the final round of the event
in 2013, according to Rose.
As each school gets its turn, it will have the
opportunity to decide the format. In Gainesville,
it is set to be a two-match tournament, meaning
each squad only gets to match up with one of
the three teams.
While fans may seem to be the big winner,
the teams will benefit just as much from the
tournament.
"It shows people that schools are willing
to play each other when given an opportunity
to do that," Rose said. "My intent was win orlose, to play three good teams in a weekend and
know more about my team whether we win or
lose."
MURPHY WINS SEC OFFENSIVE PLAYER OF THE
WEEK: For the second time in her short career
at UF, sophomore setter Kelly
Murphy has been named the
Southeastern Conference Of-
fensive Player of the Week.Volleyball In two sweeps by No. 10 UF
(14-3, 8-2 SEC) this past week-
end, Murphy notched her fifth triple-double of
the season and an impressive 26 kills in six sets
of play.
"We look at the triple-doubles as it is just an-
other night for her, and yet there are programs
that have never had a player record a triple-
double," Wise said. "It just speaks to Kelly's tal-
ent in this system."Meyer Expectations came in 90s

fumbled at the 5-yard line.

take their toll on UF?

tremely high level," Meyer said.
"And he even said that to me one
time, 'You got a little problem
when 10 wins isn't enough."'
BOBBY, from page 16
Early in the year, UF was suc
cessful running between the tack-
les, but it appears opponents are
scheming to take the inside run
away.
Addazio said the inside runs
are not dive plays but options,
where Tebow can either hand it
off or pull it and run.
If the handoff option is open,
Tebow should be giving it away
every time, so Tebow having to
run more shows that the inside
run is being taken away by de-
fenses.As great as Tebow is in short-
yardage situations, if he leads the
Gators in carries, they aren't as ef-
fective.
In their four conference games,
Tebow has two fewer rushes than
Jeff Demps, Chris Rainey and Em-
manuel Moody combined. In his
84 rushes, Tebow has totaled 306
yards for a 3.6 average. The trio
has run the ball 86 times for 524
yards, averaging 6.1 yards per
carry.
Also, when they touch the ball,
there is always the big-play po-
tential that Tebow lacks.
All three have blazing speed,especially Rainey and Demps, so
getting them to the outside could
always result in a huge run.
Running to the outside isn't
easy because outside linebackers
have a head start to the corner and
defensive ends need to be hooked
to clear that corner. Both are tough
tasks for offenses, which is why it
is important to have an inside run
game to rely on.
If teams are making it a priority
to stop runs up the middle, there
is a better chance outside runs are
open and could force teams to de-
fend them as well, taking some of
the pressure out of the middle.Arkansas made it a point to
stop the inside runs and succeed-
ed by holding the running backs
to a 2.3 average on their nine runs
between the tackles and forcing
Tebow to keep the ball more on
those option reads, which was a
big reason for his 27 carries.
The running backs had six de-
signed runs outside the box. They
averaged 5.2 yards and broke off
runs of 20 and 10 yards.
Addazio has an excuse for why
the run game may have look in-
side-run heavy.
"We were balanced this past
week, which gives you a lot lessrun calls," Addazio said.
That seems logical -except
the Gators ran the ball 46 times
and threw 27 times, and in only
two games -LSU (52) and Ken-
tucky (48) -did they run more.
The Gators are going to need to
change it up. Maybe a new block-
ing scheme for the inside game or
a new look to run it out of, any-
thing to keep defenses guessing.
Addazio may want to look into
getting some fix-it-yourself books
to correct the problem before it
gets too big and Florida needs to
call for someone to come work on
it.

UF SOCCER
Gators must win out for seniors to win fourth SEC title
By TYLER JETT
Alligator Writer
tjett@alligator org
The view is unfamiliar, and it doesn't
seem right.
Lauren Hyde, a senior with three South-
eastern Conference titles under her belt, is
used to looking down from the top. To-
day, though, she needs to crane her neck
to glance at where she has so often been
and where she wants to be again.
Tonight, as No. 12 UF (11-4-2, 5-1-2 SEC)
hosts No. 17 LSU (10-3-3, 6-1-1 SEC) at 7,
Hyde and the other three seniors hope to
prove they are still the conference's domi-
nant class.
Despite being in third place with only a
week of SEC play left, the Gators still con-
trol their own destiny.
As the Gators start this pivotal three-
match stretch, they have the benefit of fac-
ing the two teams that are ahead of them at
home, with LSU coming to Gainesville to-
day and South Carolina arriving Oct. 30.
If Florida wins its final three matches, it
will jump South Carolina and LSU, taking
another SEC Championship and giving the
seniors the view they have grown accus-
tomed to during their time in Gainesville.
But in order to do that, things need to
change.
"We have to be a lot more aggressive on
the field, and we have to have a lot more
intensity as well," Hyde said. ".We've
kind of come out a little slow in these
games on the road."
That lack of urgency, specifically away
from Gainesville, is the reason the Gatorsfind themselves in a series of must-win
situations in their next three matches. The
problem first manifested itself Oct. 2 at
perennial SEC bottom-feeder Mississippi
State, which managed a 1-1 tie against
Florida.
"Our players take a lot of pride in our
play in the SEC, and I think what's been alittle disappointing for us this year was the
fact that we gave up some opportunities,"
UF coach Becky Burleigh said.
But while the team has struggled on the
road, Florida's play at James G. Pressly
Stadium has been almost as solid as pos-
sible. The team is 9-1-0 at home, with the
only loss coming in overtime against No. 7
Andrew Stanfill / Alligator Staff
UF coach Becky Burleigh's team has dominated at home but struggled on the road
this season, going 2-3-1 away from Gainesville.Florida State in a match Burleigh described
as the best her team played this year.
"Traveling wears you down a little bit,
so hopefully that aspect gets to them,"
sophomore Lindsay Thompson said.
Besides its traveling woes, the only oth-
er reason for Florida's underperformance
thus far is its youth. With 23 underclass-
men on the roster, some of the players did
not understand how difficult winning the
SEC would be before the season started,
Hyde said.
"Our players take a lot of pride in
our play in the SEC, and I think
what's been a little disappointing
for us this year was the fact that
we gave up some opportunities."
Becky Burleigh
UF soccer coach
"The girls coming in have seen, like,
'Oh, they've won in the past. This may be
easier than it seems,"' she said. "And being
a senior that's won (the SEC) the last three
years, I know, and the rest of us know, that
it's not."
If the team did not realize how tough
conference play would be, it does now.
Luckily for the seniors, they still have time
to go out on top, albeit in an unfamiliar
way.
"You're the underdog," Burleigh said
of her squad. "I can't think that anyone
would look at the remaining schedule and
think that we're the favorites to win the
SEC."
Receivers coach unconcerned about statistics
0 UF'S STATS ARE SIMILAR
TO THE START OF 2008.
By PHIL KEGLER
Alligator Staff Writer
pkegler@alligator org
Despite all the talk about Flori-
da's offense not clicking, receivers
coach Billy Gonzales isn't worried.
In fact, he's seen this happen -just last season.
He said Wednesday he wants
to get more receivers involved in
the offense, but he pointed out that
production isn't too far off from last
season at this point.
The numbers back him up.
Through six games in 2008, UF
had completed 96 passes for 1,268
yards. Former Gators and current
NFL wide receivers Louis Murphyand Percy Harvin were responsible
for 43 of those catches, and Harvin
missed the season opener.
So far this sea-
son, the Gators have
racked up 1,264
Foot ball passing yards on 94
catches. Of those re-
ceptions, tight end
Aaron Hernandez and receiver Ri-
ley Cooper have combined for 51 ofthem.
Gonzales admits he wants to get
more touches to other guys, most
notably David Nelson and Brandon
James, but he also pointed out there
are other ways to make an impact.
"I tell guys if you wanna be in-
volved, play every special teams and
you have a chance to be on that foot-
ball field," Gonzales said. "If you're
on the field 45 snaps, whether youget the ball or not, you're involved.
"An offensive lineman ain't get-
ting the ball anytime, and what's he
doing? He's busting his butt every
single time. Everybody's got a job
to do, and if our job demands us to
be a great blocker on one play on
the perimeter, we've gotta do it. If
it demands us the next play to go
out and get open on the perimeter,
we've gotta do that."

THURSDAY, OCTOBER 22, 2009 U ALLIGATOR, 19

Lauren Hyde watched the movie, en-
grossed in it.
All the game film the senior Gator had
seen didn't compare to this particular film.
The home video hurled a wave of nostal-
gia as Lauren watched to see a glimpse of the
past embodied in the VHS cassette. She saw
her family surrounding the picture-perfect
Christmas tree towering over the crisply gift-
wrapped presents waiting to be ripped open.
Lisa Hyde, Lauren's mother, went all out
for the holidays, including Christmas. She
went through painstaking measures to make
sure everything was perfect: garland strung
around the stairwell and fireplace -com-
plete with stockings.
If there's one reason above any other Lau-
ren is watching her home video, it's that it
predates Sept. 18, 2005. That's the day Lisa
lost her fight against breast cancer and the
day a tape-recorded version of her meant in-
finitely more to her daughter.
Bad to Worse
Bill Hyde, the patriarch of the Hyde
household, knew the uphill battle his family
would have to endure with Lisa's hospital
visits and checkups and the looming possi-
bility of death, suppressed in the recesses of
their minds.
"Dealing with it 13 years, you're prepared
right from the start in 1992 that this could be
bad," Bill said.
In 2005, there was swelling in Lisa's abdo-
men. Her liver wasn't doing well.
She took a round of chemotherapy on Fri-
day, Sept. 9,2005. Chemotherapy had worked
before in 1993 and Lisa had rebounded fine
after a few sick days. Lisa woke up Saturday
in a noticeably delusional state, a first-time
change Lauren noticed for the worse. Lisa's
liver was failing, causing her delirious behav-
ior, and she needed to be hospitalized.
There were times Lisa mistook Bill to be
her own father instead of her husband.
Bill usually didn't correct her. He just car-
ried on with the conversation.
Friday, Sept. 16, 2005.
Lauren was in her technical theater class,
helping build the set for the fall play when
she was pulled from her class. It was around
11 a.m.
Her sister, Lindsey, was in Spanish class.
She, too, was called down to the office.
They had an unexpected phone call. It
was their father, letting them know they were
needed in the hospital.
Bill had been informed the previous Mon-
day that his wife may not live out the week.
Lauren said she never knew the extent of
her mother's cancer and she didn't want to
know the possibility that her mother might
pass. She didn't believe the opinion that Lisa
wouldn't live out the week until she saw it
manifest itself in that hospital room.
"I'm glad no one ever said (that she may
not make it) because I don't like that," Lauren
said. "They don't know."
That same week, amid the routine prayers,
the crossword puzzle games and the air of
grief that filled Lisa's room, there was a tight-
ening of the Hyde family unit.
Lauren said her close-knit family grew
even closer that week.
"Out of all my friends, I'm the closest to
my family easily and everyone will tell you
that," she said.
Turtle Park
When Lauren wants to think of the mem-
ories she shared with her mom, she has one
picture in mind. It's a picture of Lauren, Lisa,
Lindsey and Christina, the youngest sister.Solaice in Soccer
Lauren Hyde and the Gators will wear pink uniforms in tonight's match with LSU to
raise cancer awareness. Hyde's mother passed away in 2005 from breast cancer.
It's a photo of them on a bridge at "Turtle
Park." Aptly nicknamed because there were
turtles in one area of the park, Lauren has the
image committed to memory and remem-
bered walking along the bridge the day the
photograph was taken.
As the casual, only-a-couple-of-class-
es-deep photographer, Lisa had pictures
throughout the Hyde household that still
hang intact, just as she hung them.
Bill met his wife at work and was attract-
ed to Lisa's looks -blonde-haired, green-
eyed with an athletic figure, measuring in at
roughly 5-foot-7 -and her hardworking, no-
nonsense demeanor.
Lisa became a stay-at-home mom once
Lauren turned 2. She cleaned, cooked, drove
the kids to school and made after-school
snacks.
"She always put us first and just a true
mom to me," Lindsey said.
Lauren said what she loved most about
her mom was the fact that Lisa was always in
her children's lives.
"(A) great mom in terms of the detail and
attention she gave her kids," Bill said.
As early as they were able, Lauren and
Lindsey were picking up after themselves
and learning responsibility. Their chore list
would grow to include making beds, vacu-
uming, dusting and cleaning three rooms in
the house on Saturdays.
Lisa wouldn't have had it any other way.
For a woman who ran her house tightly,
the diagnosis of breast cancer in 1992 may
have turned then-29-year-old Lisa's world
topsy-turvy. On the contrary, her will and ef-
fort to keep everything in order was unwav-
ering thereafter."She inspired me because I knew that she
wasn't feeling well and she would just push
herself," family friend Cara Hellmich said.
Hellmich said Lisa would go on walks and
do activities with her children, seemingly un-
hindered by her cancer.
Lisa was no stranger to Lauren's friends
and school background, either. She would
attend Lauren's high school and club soccer
games and provide honest criticism while
still being her daughter's No. 1 cheerleader.
Cyclone to Gator
Beginning at age 8 or 9, soccer became a
principal influence in Lauren's life. She began
playing the sport after attending a camp in-
troduced to her by Lisa. A sports nut himself,
Bill quickly introduced his children to base-
ball and softball before soccer entered the
equation.
"From that point on, (Lauren) didn't want
to do anything else," Bill said.
Having been athletic and quick for her
age, Lauren excelled at soccer.
In middle school, she worked her way up
to the Carmel Cyclones, the club team she
played for in Indiana. The team didn't pick
up Lauren after her tryouts, but changed its
mind after she scored six goals in an indoor
tournament.
She continued playing on the club team
and joined her high school team in her sopho-
more year. Her year-round soccer exposure
sparked college interest, and Lauren commit-
ted to UF in March of her junior year.
Lisa made plans to spend the first two
weeks of college with Lauren to ease the tran-
sitional period. She even bought an orange
jacket with blue stripes in a visual display ofsupport for the colors of Lauren's soon-to-be
university. The jacket still hangs in her closet.
Lauren said if it fits, she would wear it.
Lauren, who said she plays her best when
people are watching, was the only Gators
freshman in her class to start every match
and earned third-team All-America honors
her sophomore year.
"What makes her so talented is her vision
of the field," said teammate Jessica Eicken.
Eicken, also a senior, characterized her re-
lationship with Lauren as a sisterly one.
"If you want something to get done right
and done fast, let her take care of it," Eicken
said.
Handling Grief
Before, during and after Lisa's passing,
soccer was one of Lauren's few comforts.
When she's playing soccer, she's not thinking
about anything else.
"I would definitely say I sought it out,"
Lauren said. "It was nice to be able to have
that couple hours of just nothing."
Her soccer career was never in jeopardy
after her mother's passing because Lauren
knew Lisa wouldn't have wanted her to stopplaying. Her mom was thrilled about her
daughter attending UF.
And when she wasn't strapped into cleats
and shin guards, she was armed with movies
and playing cards for euchre.
Lauren spent the weekends at friends'
places, something she'd never done before
her junior year. Her newfound group of best
friends, formed a month before Lisa's pass-
ing, served as an emotional cornerstone for
Lauren to rely on.
"My friends in high school came around
at the perfect time," she said.
In Carmel Bishop Chatard High School -
where her own graduating class numbered
180 -Lauren felt comfortable with everyone
knowing who she was as an athlete and per-
son.
She didn't mind that all her peers knew
about her mother, because it meant she didn't
have to explain being pulled out of class or
why her mother stopped showing up at
games. It meant no special treatment for the
girl whose mother passed away. And that
was OK with Lauren.
Katie Glesing, one of Lauren's classmates
at Bishop Chatard, said the smaller class size
allowed for deeper connections between peo-
ple.
"Everyone says by your senior year at
Chatard, you'll feel like a family," Glesing
said.
"And we really did."
Glesing remembered listening to "Ain't
No Mountain High Enough" with Lauren
en route to celebrate a friend's birthday. No-
body would have guessed her mother was in
the hospital that night.
While Lauren may not have externally
seemed affected by Lisa's passing, internally
she has become infinitely more apprecia-
tive of everyone in her life because she real-
ized how instantaneously someone could be
gone.
And when soccer and her friends couldn't
provide that buffer against grief, Lauren
turned to religion, praying nightly after her
mother passed away and asking God for
guidance.
Four years removed from her mother's
death, Lauren still prays, but she has come to
grips with it and believes Lisa is always with
her in spirit. Lauren is glad to call life normal
with dad, aka Mr. Mom, and her sisters.
"How much Lauren's developed and the
positive things she's done," Bill said, "really
comes from her mom."
And while the Hyde household is down
a member, Lisa's presence still looms in her
children -and their home videos.

SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE
Slive suspends officials from Arkansas-UF game
By KYLE MAISTRI
Alligator Staff Writer
kmaistri@alligator org
Southeastern Conference
commissioner Mike Slive has re-
viewed the tape, and he's seen
enough.
The commissioner anounced
Wednesday the crew that offici-
ated last Saturday's Arkansas-UF
game will be removed from its
next scheduled assignment on
Oct. 31. The crew called a person-
al foul on Razorbacks defensive
tackle Malcolm Sheppard in the
fourth quarter against the Gators,
and the league office said there
was no video evidence to support
such a call.
"While only a few calls have
been identified, the entire crew
shoulders responsibility for each
play. I have taken this action be-
cause there must be accountabil-
ity in our officiating program,"
Slive said in a statement. "Our in-
stitutions expect the highest level
of officiating in all of our sports,
and it is the duty of the confer-
ence office to uphold that expec-
tation."
Referee Marc Curles' crew also
worked the LSU-Georgia game
three weekends ago, when UGA's
A.J. Green and LSU's Charles
Scott were both penalized for
excessive celebration calls. Theleague came down on the call dard that we expect from our
against Green shortly thereafter, officiating crews," Slive said. "I
saying the crew made a mistake. believe our officiating program is
"A series of calls that have the best in the country, however,
occurred during the last several there are times when these ac-
weeks have not been to the stan- tions must be taken."rivt~ ftSEC DOWN?: Georgia coach Mark
Richt was asked in the weekly
SEC coaches teleconference if he
felt as though the conference is
down this year outside of Florida
and Alabama."Every year at this time, SEC
teams are all gonna have the same
records," Richt said. "Mathemati-
cally, that has to be the case."
Last season at this time, UF
and Alabama were in the top five
of the AP Poll, just as they are this
season, with Georgia and LSU
also ranked.
This year, LSU and South
Carolina are ranked in the top 25,
giving the conference the same
number of teams.
KICKING CONTROVERSY: South
Carolina coach Steve Spurrier
filed a complaint to the com-
missioner's office regarding
the potential use of white tape
by Alabama kicker Leigh Tiffin
on field goals and extra points
during last weekend's 20-6 win
against the Gamecocks.
Coach Nick Saban responded
to the controversy on the telecon-
ference Wednesday.
"I have to be very honest about
this, I was not aware of it," Sa-
ban said. "It is a 5-yard penalty.
Over half the teams in the league
do something to mark the spot.
Whether it's dirt or a twig. Last
year, South Carolina's kicker did
this. It is something that shouldn't
be done because it's against the
rules. I was happy it was brought
to my attention because it's some-
thing we won't continue to do."
