Before Tuesday’s Senate 
meeting, Student Body 
President Christina Bonarrigo welcomed the crowd at the 2013 State of the Campus address and praised accomplishments contributing to UF’s mission to become a top-10 university.
She spoke about the 
upcoming debut of UF Online in January and the Aim Higher campaign.
“We want to look at higher 
education as an investment and not an expenditure,” Bonarrigo said.
A hot topic among students 
for the past year, the Reitz Union expansion was one of the ﬁ  rst points mentioned. The expansion will add 100,000 square feet of space entirely for students, she said, including a ﬂ  oor for student involvement.
UF’s latest renovations 
would also include the revamping of Newell Hall into a state-of-the-art study space this Spring, if funding is provided by the state. 
The new center would be 
open 24/7.
Bonarrigo said more study 
space was the No. 1 thing students asked for on the most recent Student Experience in the Research University survey.
Student Government’s 
achievements this year include a central syllabus website, a Student Body president blog that has garnered more than 12,000 views and a movement VOLUME 108 ISSUE 64 WWW.ALLIGATOR.ORG WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 20, 2013

� BERNIE MACHEN ADDRESSED THEM AT 
A MEETING THURSDAY.

President Bernie Machen recently addressed the 
Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences faculty 
about his proposed changes to the board that reviews tenure and promotions, causing reverberations among concerned employees.
Machen and Jack Payne, the senior vice president 
for agriculture and natural resources, assured those in attendance at a meeting last week that Machen’s pro-posal keeps the faculty’s best interests in mind.
The Academic Personnel Board is currently com-
posed of six members who review more than 200 cases a year for promotions and tenure recommenda-tions. The proposal suggests the board split into two bodies with 10 to 12 members, lessening the workload and allowing for a more in-depth review process.
But some of the faculty were hesitant to accept this 
proposal. 
Some faculty members, such as Stephen Futch, felt 
dividing the APB would create a schism between ex-tension faculty, which are UF employees stationed off campus, and nonextension faculty.
Futch, an extension agent based in Lake Alfred, 
Fla., said it’s important to make sure that extension faculty are the same as regular employees.
Payne said all faculty are not treated the same, but 
extension specialists have always been on the tenure track. In the APB’s current form, both groups are ﬁ  l-tered through a single review board.
The split in the board would entail one group re-
viewing tenure-track faculty while the other handles extension faculty.
Payne said the issue with the current APB setup re-
volves around its recent increase of negative reviews throughout the last few years. UF IFAS faculty

UF students kicked off De-Stress Fest in 
West by taking a rest. 
Nap Day was the ﬁ  rst of a weeklong se-
ries of events for students, including a Super Smash Bros. tournament sponsored by Gator 
Gaming, free yoga classes and visits from ther-apy puppies.
Samantha Duboff, a 19-year-old UF ac-
counting freshman, said the events were something she might check out. 
“I think the therapy puppies sound the most interesting,” she said.
For Nap Day, about 50 tired students 
caught some z’s Monday night in the ﬁ  rst-ever designated nap room in Library West.
Michele Lesure, the night and weekends 
circulation coordinator for the library, said the room was stocked with sleeping mats from the Outﬁ  tter, cots and 50 travel pillows handmade by the librarians. The mood was set with the sounds of rain. Hot and iced tea — as well as ear plugs — were available for students. 
“They work so hard, and we see them 
struggling in the library,” Lesure said. “I’m eternally impressed by how great the students are and how hard they work.”
The event was funded through two library 
funds and staffed by volunteers from the li-brary ambassadors group. The event is unlike-ly to be repeated for liability reasons, Lesure said. Library West gives sleepy UF students space to nap it outSEE STATE, PAGE 4SEE IFAS, PAGE 4

An article in Monday’s Alligator incorrectly stated about 60 students a week go into UF’s Student Health Care Center for STD screening. It should have said the SHCC sees about 60 students a week in the STI/STD Testing Clinic, a partnership with the Alachua County Health Department. Additional students get tested in meet-ings with their primary care teams.

Dedrah Mathis wanted to thank two of 
her teaching assistants and show her ap-
preciation for their work this semester, but showing appreciation as a student can be difﬁ  cult in large lectures.
The 19-year-old UF sociology sopho-more heard about Apple-4-U at the Cam-pus Diplomat Fall Forum and decided to check it out.
From now through Friday, the Cam-
pus Diplomats want to help students send small tokens of appreciation to professors and TAs by offering notes and small gifts.
The diplomats have apple-themed eras-
ers and pom-poms they will deliver for free. Students can visit the Campus Dip-lomats table on Turlington Plaza from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. daily to write notes to their teachers.
Students must supply the building and 
room number of their teacher or TA’s of-ﬁ  ce, so the gifts and notes can be delivered Dec. 4.
Olivia Couret, co-chair of Apple-4-U, said she used to thank her teachers and give them gifts in high school.
“In college, it’s harder to approach 
teachers if you don’t have that relation-ship with them,” said Couret, a 19-year-old UF physics sophomore. “I feel like this is a great medium in which they can reach out to their teachers and give them thanks without having to worry.”

� THE NEW HUT HAS 
SOLAR PANELS.
ALEX HARRIS
Alligator Staff Writer

Sustainable UF’s new so-
lar-powered Sustainability 
Hut shined at its debut on Turlington Plaza on Tuesday.
The original hut, which 
is used to educate students about sustainability through games and contests, was the same model as GatorWell Health Promotion Services’s, made of PVC pipes and tarp with a green and yellow color scheme.
The new hut is made of 
reclaimed wood and locally sourced steel. 
It features a folding wing 
design with two, 250-watt donated solar panels, and it’s pulled along by a bike.
The solar panels provide 
enough energy to power four laptops at once, said Kevin Curry, a 26-year-old UF ar-chitecture graduate student and one of the designers of the project.
He said the mobile sus-
tainability unit was a col-laboration between UF’s architecture and building construction management departments.Curry said the depart-
ments were approached by Sustainable UF to design the unit, which he called the “most compact way to get out and share their sustainable message.”
The project was funded 
through a limited budget provided by Sustainable UF, which encouraged the design team to be more innovative with their materials, Curry said.
Jeremy Toms, a 21-year-
old environmental engineer-ing senior and Sustainability Hut intern, said the updates to the hut make it easier for volunteers to set up and move around.
However, he said the old 
hut offered something the new one doesn’t — visibility.
“It just doesn’t shout out 
at you like the big yellow and green hut,” he said. “We’re working on a way to amend that.”New Sustainability

Local agencies collaborated 
with a U.S. Marshals task force 
to catch a man Tuesday who had an outstanding arrest warrant in Gainesville.
U.S. Marshals caught up with 
Tyron Walker in Alexandria, Va., on Tuesday morning, where of-ﬁ  cials reported they saw him do-ing construction work on a roof in a shopping plaza, according to a news release. 
He was arrested and taken to 
the Fairfax County Adult Deten-tion Center in Virginia, according to the release.
Walker was wanted on charges 
of robbery with a ﬁ  rearm and pos-session of a ﬁ  rearm by a convicted felon. He reportedly pulled a late-night armed robbery at a Checkers restaurant in Gainesville on Oct. 4.Gainesville Police, the Alachua 
County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce and the U.S. Marshals Florida Regional Fu-gitive Task Force worked together to complete the arrest, according to the release. The agencies inves-tigated and gathered tips that ulti-mately led them to Virginia.
In the release, U.S. Marshal Ed 
Spooner said the arrest “highlights the great cooperation” between the agencies to “track down and apprehend fugitives wanted for violent crimes.”

Also discussed was the expansion of free printing to ﬁ  ve

The State of the Campus address concluded with 
Bonarrigo’s hopeful look to the future.
“We’ve come a long way from last year,” she said. “The 
question is how can we take Student Government to the next level?”
Following the address, the weekly Student Senate meeting 
was called to order with 81 senators.
The two ﬁ  rst reading motions were tabled.The ﬁ  rst, concerning funding for the Falling Gators 
Skydiving Club, was postponed until the addition of a liability form for all involved students, said Allocations Committee Chairman Davis Bean. 
The second, the Senator Accountability Act, was postponed 
for further review and correction of grammatical errors, said Judiciary Committee Chairman Austin Sherman.
All new legislation will be due Nov. 29 at noon.There will be no Senate meeting Nov. 26 due to the 
upcoming Thanksgiving Break.
Also announced was a weeklong drive to collect nonfood 
materials for victims of the disaster in the Philippines, taking place from 11 a.m. to  2 p.m. every day on Turlington Plaza. 
Nightlife Navigators announced it has been working more 
closely with University Police to encourage safety among students. 
This includes an upcoming “blue video campaign” through

On Thursday from 12 to 3 p.m., the group will host a Cash

Some faculty disagree with APB split
Although only two to three facul-
ty members were turned down pre-
viously, 27 received negative votes last year and 24 the year before that.
“You’re dealing with peoples’ ca-
reers in those packets,” he said.
Payne said mainly extension fac-
ulty are receiving the negative votes. With the current system, board members who might not grasp the facets of an extension faculty mem-ber’s job might be more likely to turn them down on review.“We need a more fair, a more 
just, system,” he said. “We never wanted to send the signal that we have a second-class faculty.”Timothy Martin, a professor of 
tree physiology, said in an email that during a meeting of roughly 50 School of Forest Resources and Con-servation faculty members, he asked for their feedback on Machen’s pro-posal. 
The consensus of the meeting 
was that the split in the APB would potentially be a disruptive way to address a workload issue in the committee.
“There are likely better and less 
disruptive solutions to the workload problem,” he said.IFAS , from page 1“We need a more fair, a

Foodies and art lovers will unite 
Thursday when karaoke bar Stage 7 
kicks off its Food Truck Rally for the Arts event.
The rally, which is also a soft opening for the karaoke bar, begins at 5 p.m. at 4110 SW 34th St.
It will have a ribbon cutting cer-
emony ofﬁ  ciated by the Gainesville Area Chamber of Commerce and an art display from the students at the Gainesville Association for the Cre-ative Arts.About ﬁ  ve food trucks will be 
at the event, including Hoggtowne Lemonade Co., Humble Pie and Sababa UF, said John Bryan, Stage 7 marketing director. He said those who attend the event should expect to experience more than a standard food truck rally.“What we’re offering is more of 
a food truck plus,” Bryan said. “On top of having a couple of vendors, we’ll possibly have some live music, some performances, and people can check out the karaoke bar itself.”
Ten percent of the proﬁ  ts will 
beneﬁ  t the Gainesville Association for the Creative Arts, and Mayra Sat-terﬁ  eld, program director for the as-sociation, said she is excited the bar is gathering support for local art. 
“It’s important to recognize we 
need each other,” she said. “We can display little snippets of what our kids do throughout the year.”

Stars at night are 
big and racist: 
UT cancels game 
This week, the University of Texas at Austin chapter of 
Young Conservatives of Texas made headlines when news outlets picked up on a game the organization had 
created called Catch an Illegal Immigrant.
According to NPR, “’Any UT student who catches one of 
these ‘illegal immigrants’ and brings them back to our table will receive a $25 gift card,’ the group wrote on its Facebook page. ‘The purpose of this event is to spark a campuswide dis-cussion about the issue of illegal immigration, and how it af-fects our everyday lives.’”
The game was swiftly canceled after UT President Bill Pow-
ers released a statement regarding Young Conservatives’ plans to play on campus.
“As Americans, we should always visualize our Statue 
of Liberty and remember that our country was built on the strength of immigration. Our nation continues to grapple with difﬁ  cult questions surrounding immigration,” he wrote. “I ask YCT to be part of that discussion but to ﬁ  nd more productive and respectful ways to do so that do not demean their fellow students.”
The students of UT reacted to the club’s poorly planned 
“awareness” campaign with outrage. One student quoted in the NPR article described it as “classless, childish and racist.”
Yikes. What is it about college campuses, which are sup-
posed to be hotbeds of progressive thought and action, that lets students believe this kind of insensitive behavior is OK? The actions of this particular chapter of Young Conservatives are even more despicable considering undocumented students are allowed to enroll at UT. Imagine you are a young man or wom-an who made good grades in high school and studies hard in college only to be mocked by your fellow students?
The level of ignorance displayed by YCT is truly astound-
ing. “Catching” an “illegal immigrant” and trading them in for a gift card does nothing to raise awareness of an issue or open a rational discussion — it only alienates other students and provides a shallow, wholly unrealistic portrayal of the way im-migration works in this country.
Perhaps it isn’t simple ignorance, however. The game could 
have been a calculated effort to shame undocumented students and contribute to an exclusionary campus culture.
It’s also ironic that YCT would attach themselves so pub-
licly to a poorly planned awareness campaign on illegal immi-gration so close to Thanksgiving — which basically commemo-rates the beginning of illegal immigration in America.
What the members of YCT — and people who wear black-
face makeup — don’t recognize is that they have the privilege of removing the “illegal immigrant” sign once the game is over. For undocumented students who are simply trying to earn an education and a better life for their families, the unfair stigma remains, and it’s hardly a game. Provocative stunts like Catch an Illegal Immigrant never open intelligent conversations. They offend hardworking students, embarrass the university and reﬂ  ect badly on conservatives as a whole.
ALEC’s voting bill threatens democracy 
In several of my previous columns, I have made reference to the American Legislative Exchange Council. ALEC is an organization composed of corporations, interest 
groups and legislators at the state and federal levels. 
Corporate members of ALEC include AOL, Comcast, 
Exxon Mobil and dozens of other large corporations. A num-ber of prominent politicians from across the country are for-mer members of ALEC. 
In addition, more than two dozen members of the Florida 
Legislature have either claimed ALEC membership or at-tended an ALEC annual meeting since 2011.
According to its website, the organization seeks to “ad-
vance the fundamental principles of free-market enterprise, limited government, and federalism at the state level.” 
In practice, this means ALEC promotes state legislation 
like massive tax cuts for the wealthy and reduced govern-ment regulations that beneﬁ  t the rich and powerful at the expense of the middle class and the poor. 
ALEC has also supported voter ID laws, which require 
citizens to present certain types of ID in order to register to vote. In addition, its members have supported reducing early voting hours in states around the country. 
These laws have the purpose of reducing voter turnout, 
particularly among groups that are least likely to support ALEC’s agenda. These demographic groups include African-Americans, Hispanics and college students.
Now, ALEC is promoting a piece of legislation that 
would further restrict the ability of ordinary citizens to have their voices heard in government by undermining the 17th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Before the ratiﬁ  cation of the 17th Amendment in 1913, U.S. senators were selected by state legislatures. The amendment altered this process and called for senators to be directly elected by the people.  
Supporters of the amendment sought to ensure that sena-
tors would represent ordinary citizens rather than elite state legislators, who have historically been wealthier than their constituents. 
The ALEC-supported Equal State’s Enfranchisement Act 
would take a step toward taking this representation away from the people and putting it back in the hands of state legislators. The bill would allow a plurality of a state legislature to nominate a candidate for the U.S. Senate. This candidate would ap-pear on the ballot alongside those nominated by traditional party pri-maries and conventions. 
Karla Jones, ALEC’s director of 
international and federal relations, claims the proposed legislation is 
“a way to preserve the good parts of the 17th Amendment” and not a means of circumventing it. Jones said the Equal State’s Enfranchisement Act ensures that state legislatures have “a voice in the [electoral] process, which the constitu-tional founders originally thought they should have.”
The true motivation for ALEC’s support of this bill is like-
ly far more sinister. ALEC essentially participates in a form of legalized bribery: It sponsors all-expenses-paid, luxuri-ous conferences for state legislators to “educate” them about ALEC’s newest model legislation.
ALEC also facilitates interaction between these legislators 
and representatives of large corporations, many of whom provide donations to the re-election campaigns of these same politicians. 
By increasing the inﬂ  uence of state legislatures on electing 
U.S. senators, ALEC hopes to bring even more supporters of its ultra-conservative, corporate-friendly agenda to the halls of Congress.
Americans largely agree that corporations and wealthy 
Americans already have an outsized and harmful inﬂ  uence on American government and public policy. A 2012 survey conducted by Bannon Communications found that a whop-ping 83 percent of Americans believe that “corporations and corporate CEOs have too much political power and inﬂ  u-ence.” Allowing ALEC to restrict the democratic nature of American elections by weakening the 17th Amendment will only exacerbate the corruption and corporate cronyism that plagues the American political system.

Bullying is a pervasive problem in our 
society
About 160,000 students, afraid of being 
attacked or harassed, skip school every day. 
Bullying begins in elementary school, peaks in middle school and lessens in high school, but it does not stop there. It has recently moved from inside school hallways onto the football ﬁ  eld. Though evidence is still coming to light, it’s clear that a Miami Dolphin lineman, Richie Incognito, acted inappropriately toward a vul-nerable teammate, Jonathan Martin. The fact that the resulting investigation has made hun-dreds of headlines is no surprise: Bullying is a signiﬁ  cant problem. The fact that many chil-dren admire NFL players makes it critical for locker room behavior to be honorable. 
Although we applaud the media for giving 
this story so much attention, we urge a resolv-able ending: A lesson needs to be learned. No one should tolerate the maltreatment of others  for any reason. Incognito, Martin’s teammates, coaches and fans can learn from this incident to prevent acts of harassment from happening in the future. 
How? By the use of healthy communica-
tion strategies — a solution-based approach employed by the River Phoenix Center for Peacebuilding.
So how can a person be truly heroic, not 
only on the ﬁ  eld, but also off? By seeking re-storative justice in all scenarios. It seems likely that the Incognito case would have ended differently and that the bullying of students would decrease if peace-building techniques were used earlier. As our country ﬂ  ourishes, we not only need to recognize scandalous behavior, but offer supportive solutions! The RPCP has organized workshops, marches and compelling events to raise awareness for peace in all forms. In the near future, we hope this knowledge will continue to grow, not just in Gainesville, but around the world.

Letter to the Editor
There are only two options for 
all of us: to have or to be.
Part of my bike ride to 
mosque involves going through a dark alley for at least a minute. Every night as I cruise that path — escaping Gainesville’s bustling nightlife for a few seconds — I look up. The ocean of darkness never fails to leave every ﬁ  ber of my being quivering in awe.
The stars ceaselessly dance through the night, 
waiting for someone to appreciate their per-formance. Millions of people, those of past and forgotten generations, have served as faithful au-diences for the celestial beauty. At times, I think the stars must wonder, “When will humans ever learn?”
Inside each of us is a quest for happiness — 
this much is obvious. 
Throughout history, different cultures have 
tried to come up with ways to get to the elixir of joy.
The way at UF follows that of the other col-
leges: We wake up and go to class. Come back, eat and ﬁ  nish a WebAssign. Go back to sleep. Re-peat ﬁ  ve times. The routine takes a fun twist on Friday and Saturday nights. Sunday is recovery from all the sex and booze — after all, it is the Lord’s day of rest.
Our college life is one of radical hedonism,  to 
borrow Erich Fromm’s words. Almost every sin-gle action is for immediate gratiﬁ  cation.
Fromm said this is “the greatest social experi-
ment ever made to solve the question whether pleasure … can be a satisfactory answer to the problem of human existence.” Unfortunately, the results are “in the negative.”
If anything, we’ve increased in our neediness. 
Perhaps we assumed our tech advancements would get us somewhere. But the increasingly faster Wi-Fi connections and lighter laptops have hardly increased anyone’s long-term happiness.
“Man has become a superman ... He has failed 
to rise to the level of superhuman reason which should match that of his superhuman strength… To the degree to which his power grows he becomes more and more a poor man ... a fact which had hither-to been steadfastly denied: the more the superman gains in strength, the poorer he becomes.” 
This is what Albert Schweitzer 
said when he accepted the 1952 No-bel Peace Prize.
The dancing stars above us have 
seen all our failures and they surely echo the words of Gandhi: “The world has enough for everyone’s need, but not enough for everyone’s greed.” When will humans ever learn this simple concept?
These days, pundits throw different political 
ideologies at us. They claim if we accept a certain philosophical viewpoint, the world will be bliss. I only wish.
The ancients have always said there are only 
two options: “to have or to be,” as Fromm put it. If we desire “to have,” our years will be spent stufﬁ  ng our closets with Marc Jacobs bags and our pockets with the latest iPhones.
But if we choose “to be,” the world will be a 
different place. “To be” means to lose the “me, me and some more of me” ideology. When you ponder how the sun provides Earth with warmth and how plants grow fruits, you realize every-thing is in a state of giving. If you want to become your actual self, take heed from nature.
College life is ripe for introspection. When I 
came to UF, a friend told me something interest-ing: “What you are by the end of your undergrad years is what you will be for the rest of your life.”
Please don’t make Oscar Wilde’s words — 
“youth is wasted on the young” — come true. Millions before, just like us, constantly found ways to satisfy their immediate temptations. But a few chose a different route: the one of loving, caring and struggling. This is the only one that is genuinely human.

Fifty years ago this 
Friday, two bul-lets tore through 
the body and head of the president of the United States, mak-ing Nov. 22, 1963, the most infamous day in American history since Pearl Harbor.  
From the moment news of 
President John F. Kennedy’s assas-sination reached the world, people began to clamor for answers. As the case unfolded, the details of the assassination that emerged were either upsetting or suspicious. In response to these details, people began to doubt the ofﬁ  cial version of events, that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone and without any out-side support.  
Instead, these people came up 
with their own theories about what happened, placing the blame on the government, Cuba, disgruntled Maﬁ  a bosses and other shadowy ﬁ  gures. More “evidence” of at least a cover-up helped prove these con-spiracy theories for some and made them plausible in the eyes of many in the American public.  
The most famous detail is the 
murder of Oswald two days after the assassination by a nightclub owner with underworld connec-tions, Jack Ruby, before the alleged assassin ever stood trial. The shoot-ing was broadcast live on national television at a time when millions of Americans were staring at their sets, desperately searching for answers. The events of that week, horrifying as they were, captured our collec-tive imagination. Every anniversary of the assassination brings up the same speculations that were made the years before, and conspiracy-themed movies and TV shows love to tell us who really killed Kennedy.   
Government inves-
tigations concluded that Oswald killed the president alone, but the public has never been satisﬁ  ed by this 
answer. This is honestly under-standable, especially for people who were alive at the time of the killing, a little more than a year after we al-most experienced nuclear war.  
Oddly, it’s more comforting to 
believe the leader of the Free World was murdered by a dark and shad-owy conspiracy of his enemies rath-er than believe his life was undone by one deranged man with a gun.  
Half a century later, the con-
spiracy theories are still strongly in place. According to a poll  con-ducted by Gallup last week, 61 per-cent of Americans still believe that someone other than Oswald was responsible for Kennedy’s death. Although that is, surprisingly, the lowest percentage of conspiracy be-lievers since the late 1960s, it shows that the majority of Americans still harbor suspicions of the ofﬁ  cial ver-sion of events.  The ﬁ  rst and only successful presidential assassina-tion in the age of television, radio and photography was burned into the minds and hearts of Americans everywhere, and new generations are taught about the killing with the same media records, experiencing the event for themselves. Fifty years later, we still haven’t fully healed from the trauma of Kennedy’s death.

freshman. His column appears on Wednesdays.

On Nov. 7, the Food and Drug Admin-
istration announced it intends to ban trans fats from the American diet. 
According to FDA Commissioner Mar-
garet A. Hamburg, “further reduction in the amount of trans fat in the American diet could prevent an additional 20,000 heart attacks and 7,000 deaths from heart disease each year.” While this move by the FDA is for the good of public health, there is a looming question that is a little bothersome: why a government orga-nization is allowed to decide what food prod-ucts companies are allowed to produce and therefore, what Americans are allowed to eat.
Certainly, trans fats are unhealthy. Accord-
ing to the FDA, because they raise bad choles-terol and lower good cholesterol, “there is no safe level of consumption of artiﬁ  -cial trans fat.” 
However, a comparison can 
be drawn to the use of tobacco. Tobacco usage can lead to a mul-titude of scary side effects — like that picture of a gross black lung from my middle school science book. But while the tobacco industry is heavily regulated, Americans can choose to partake in the use of tobacco. One of the differ-ences between the two is the government puts a large sum of money into education concern-ing tobacco use. Any schoolchild can tell you smoking is bad, but Americans are not as well-educated on what is in their food. But it is not the job of the government to make Americans healthier by banning certain ingredients. It seems Americans are get-
ting an education on trans fats. The Grocery Manufacturers of America told USA Today that food manufacturers had already 
voluntarily lowered trans fats in their prod-ucts by 73 percent since 2005. The Snack Food Association, another processed food lobby, told WebMD that 95 percent of its members have reduced trans fats in their products and a majority intend to eliminate them altogether. Furthermore, consumer intake of trans fats has decreased from 4.6 grams a day in 2003 to one gram per day in 2012. 
These statistics suggest that not only is 
the FDA ban a little late in the game, it is not needed. Just as food manufacturers have the option 
to eliminate trans fats from their products, they should also have the option to keep them, as long as they make their use of trans fats clear. 
Although the FDA’s proposed ban of trans 
fats is in the spirit of promoting good health for the American people, it is not needed and does not give individual Americans free choice of what they want to put in their bodies. If the FDA really wants to change the American diet, the best route is to help educate Americans on health and what is in their food. That way, in-dividuals can make conscious, healthy choices for themselves and their families.

Random acts of kindness will 
be taking place in Gainesville this 
week.
Through Friday, the Freshman 
Leadership Council is hosting Proj-ect Smile Week, a new event that encourages people to perform ran-dom acts of kindness, said Maria Galindo, the council’s vice chair of public relations.
The 21-year-old UF journalism 
senior said Project Smile Week is for everyone.
“We want to see this smile 
spread,” Galindo said.
Mitchell Nielsen, director of 
special events, said his nine-person committee hosts about six events each year, but with room on the calendar, they had the opportunity to add something new.
The 19-year-old UF information 
systems and operations manage-ment sophomore said his commit-tee was inspired by random acts of kindness seen on Vine, a smart-phone application for six-second videos. Nielson said Project Smile Week is something the council has never done before, but he hopes it will become a tradition.
“We need to take a week to just 
kind of stop and appreciate the fact that we are here, and the people around us are really great,” he said.
The committee also plans to pass out notes with snacks — two at a time — to people around campus with the idea that the recipient will pass the second treat on, Nielsen said.
He said being involved in the 
smile initiative is easy, and it doesn’t cost anything for students to participate.
Nielson said council members 
are encouraging people to post about the random acts of kindness on Twitter, Vine, Facebook and Ins-tagram with the hashtag #smileUF.
Galindo said the council is work-
ing with other UF departments on a surprise for the person that Niels-en’s committee feels really under-stands the idea behind the week.“If one person is inspired to 
make another person smile, then I think that would be successful,” she said.
U Matter, We Care, an on-cam-
pus initiative to aid those in dis-tress in the UF community, is co-sponsoring the event.
Seth Drashinsky, an 18-year-
old UF accounting freshman, said although he tries to perform ran-dom acts of kindness every day, he thinks this event might inspire oth-ers to actually go out of their way.
“If you say, like, one nice thing 
to a person, it could change their day,” he said. “It could change their week. It could change their life. You just never know.”

Americans prefer using websites like Netflix and You-
Tube instead of peer-to-peer file sharing, according to a 
new study.
Peer-to-peer file sharing, or P2P, is a protocol commonly 
used by legal services and pirate websites. This type of file sharing allows users to share a file in pieces, BBC reported last week.
P2P file sharing accounts for less than 10 percent of the 
total daily traffic in North America, according to the study conducted by tech company Sandvine. Five years ago, it ac-counted for more than 31 percent.
The study also reported Netflix and YouTube together 
account for more than 50 percent of downstream traffic on fixed networks.
Shigang Chen, a UF professor in the computer and infor-
mation science and engineering department, said he thinks people are moving away from P2P systems and focusing on other ways to use the Internet, such as YouTube.
He said the decline in traffic mentioned in the study is 
not unusual, and even though P2P file sharing appears to be declining, it still gets significant traffic.
“Ten percent of total traffic in North America — that’s 
huge,” Chen said.
Sarah Eden, a 21-year-old UF marine sciences junior, has 
a Netflix account she uses frequently.
She had a PC, but she said the computer crashed because 
of the effects of using pirate websites. She now has a Mac.
She said she thinks more students are using Netflix be-
cause of the selection of movies and TV shows available, as well as the reliability of the website.
“I feel like more people are actually spending the money 
on Netflix or other accounts because they’re finding it more worthwhile,” she said.
Jenna Ingram, a 21-year-old UF health education and 
behavior junior, said the convenience of P2P file sharing websites is a reason people use them.
She said on pirate websites, there aren’t commercials, 
and a user can watch a TV episode that aired an hour ear-lier. 
Netflix and other similar websites don’t have recent 
episodes of popular shows that college students want to watch, Ingram said.
However, she said, the legal threat that comes with us-
ing pirate websites keeps people from using them.
“It’s a little bit nerve-racking to know you’re watching it 
illegally,” Ingram said. Peer-to-peer file 
sharing down, Netflix usage up

Senior year of high school is the time to choose a col-
lege to attend and a major to study — but about a third of 
incoming freshmen are picking subjects they aren’t really interested in, according to a recently released report from the ACT.
The report, which was based off responses given by 
students taking the ACT, stated 32 percent of students se-lected a major that was a “poor fit” with their interests. 
Thirty-six percent chose a major aligned with their in-
terests, and as the composite ACT score increased, so did the percentage of students who designated majors that were a “good fit.”
Heather White, director of UF’s Career Resource Center, 
said a number of influences can sway students from study-ing a subject they are truly interested in. The past decade of economic recession and parental pressure to pick a well-paying career are strong factors for any students’ decision.
“What we try to emphasize at the CRC is that major 
does not equal career,” White said.
She said students should take advantage of all the re-
sources available to them, whether that means CRC per-sonnel, academic advisers or older students.“I think it’s important to choose something you’re inter-
ested in and you want to learn about,” she said.
She said students should take into account their long-
term goals, whether that is going into a field they are ex-cited about or just making money.
Kenneth Fernandez, an 18-year-old UF freshman whose 
major is still undecided, said he has been playing violin for 10 years and would take a job as a musician if it paid well. 
But he decided on balancing his passions with practical-
ity and plans to major in chemical engineering.
“I wouldn’t say follow your heart — that’s too cliche,” 
he said. “Just pick what you like and what works.”Students choose not to study interests
“I feel like more people are actually spending 
the money on Netflix or other accounts because 
they’re finding it more worthwhile.”

dance of off cam-pus housing options 
including apartments, condos, houses and rooms for rent, so take your time and be sure to visit 5-6 properties in person before signing a lease.  Follow the steps and tips below for ﬁ  nding the right place for you:
Use UF’s Off Campus Housing Locator Service 
at http://housing.offcampus.uﬂ  .edu. Know your budget and choose a property that 
allows you to live within your means.
Create a priority list.  What do you care about 
most in a living space?  Room size, rent, type of lease, type of community (large under-graduate population, gradu-ate students, local residents, etc.), location, proximity to campus or bus route…all these things are factors to consider when choosing a place to live.  Devise a list of ideal charac-teristics you want in your future living space and keep these criteria in mind when selecting a location.
Choose a well-suited roommate or choose to 
live alone.  Know what kind of person would best comple-ment your personality and choose accordingly.
Drive around and visit the property and neighbor-
hood you are looking to live in.  
Take a tour of the com-plexes or houses that 
interest you, ask questions, and get to know the complex management or rental house landlord.
Ask your friends for advice on where to live.  
Which properties worked well for them?  Which didn’t?
Visit the Gainesville Police Department website 
www.gainesvillepd.org and click on the Crime Reports link to view crime statistics before signing a lease.  Enter the ad-dress you’re interested in and all reported crime incidents will appear on the map.  
Go back to the property at night and make some 
observations.  Is it well lit, do you see the security guard that management promised, is the security gate working, is it quiet enough to study, how close is the bus stop or parking to the complex or house, etc.?
Once you’ve narrowed down your search, make 
an appointment with UF’s Student Legal Services by going to their website www.studentlegalservices.uﬂ  .edu and completing the Client Intake Form.  SLS can help you in reviewing the lease BEFORE you sign it.  This is a great way to know what your legal re-sponsibilities will be under that lease.

Make sure you read and fully understand all aspects of the lease before signing.  A lease is a contract 
between you and your landlord that spells out speciﬁ  c details of your living arrangement.  Leases often involve policies about pets, security and pet deposits, legal entry and other important infor-
mation.  Typically, leases in Gainesville are for 12 months. If you will need your place for 10 months or less, talk with the management about whether they can provide you a short-term lease.  There are two types of leases that are usually available, Joint Leases and Individual Leases.4, STUDENT LIVING GUIDE, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 20, 2013

A great University of Florida resource available to full-time 
students is Student Legal Services.  For any questions on your 
lease, visit the Student Legal Services website www.studentle-
galservices.uﬂ  .edu and set up an appointment with a lawyer 
to help review it BEFORE you sign it. All roommates are held responsible for the lease.  If one person breaks the lease, the other room-
mates are held responsible for paying the total rent.  This tends to be the lease more prominent when renting a house or single family dwelling.
Each person is held responsible for his or her own actions.  For instance, if one roommate breaks the 
lease, that person is still responsible for paying their own rent.  For most college students, individual leases are the best choice.  Each person in the lease is responsible for his or her own actions and not the actions of a roommate.

RoommatesRoommates Communication is key.  Talk 
about your budget for hous-
ing, expectations for safety, ex-pectations for guests and what your housing needs are before you even begin your search.  Be-ing on the same page as your roommates will make your co-habitation experience much bet-ter and reduce the possibility of conflict. 
Start with a friend or sibling.  These are often good op-
tions for roommates since you al-ready know them.
Before moving in, estab-lish an agreement about 
who will get which bedroom and bathroom along with which cabinets/storage space each person can use.
Discuss how payment of rent and bills will take place.  Is each person responsible 
for their own bills or will someone be in charge of collecting payment from each roommate?
Don’t have someone you want to live with?  Some apartment complexes offer 
“Roommate Matching” or “Roommate Place-ment.”
Roommate Matching: You fill out a sur -
vey and management attempts to 
match you with like roommates based on the information you provide them
Roommate Placement: Apartment man-agement places you in any open space 
they have available
Make sure you can change apartments if management places you with room-
mates you are not compatible with.

you check the crime stats of an area before moving there.  A free service called Crime Reports is avail-able on the Gainesville Police Department’s website.  Crime Reports allows you to see all reported crime in a certain area.  Go to www.gainesvillepd.org, click “Crime Reports” on the right-hand side, and enter the address of interest to see local incident data.
Below are ﬁ  ve tips to use when looking at safety during your apartment search:
1Go back to 
the complex at 
night.  How do you feel?  Is the place well-lit and popu-lated or dark and isolated?2 Does the prop-erty have 
working secu-rity gates and/or guards? 3Check for dead 
bolts on the out-
side door, locks for individual doors, alarm systems, etc. and ask lots of ques-tions about the se-curity.  Is there an extra charge for a security system?4Has there been 
crime in the 
area recently?  What actions have been done to pre-vent crime from happening?5Don’t forget about purchas-
ing some Renter’s Insurance to pro-tect you and your stuff from the unex-pected.

Information reprinted with permission by UF’s Off Campus LifeIf you are thinking about renting 
a house or apartment, Renter’s Insurance provides important 
coverage for both you and your possessions. A standard Renter’s Policy protects your personal property in case of theft or damage and may pay for temporary living expenses if your rental is damaged (including loss of use). It can also shield you from personal liability. Anyone who leases a house or apartment should consider this type of coverage. 
 Renter’s Insurance
Talk with your parents before getting your own 
renter’s policy.  If you are still ﬁ  nancially dependent on your parents or a family 
member and they own a home, they might be able to cover you under their home-owner’s policy.  Some homeowner policies will cover a dependent’s rental property while in college.  
There are several types of Residential Insurance policies.  Read your policy information carefully and ensure you have full coverage.  Policies should in-
clude the following items: 
• Fire or lightning 
• Windstorm or hail • Explosion • Aircraft • Vehicles • Smoke • Vandalism or malicious 
mischief 
• Theft • Damage by glass or safe-
ty-glazing material that is part of a building 
• Falling objects • Water-related damage 
from home utilities 
• Electrical surge damage
Floods, earthquakes, and hurricanes 
aren’t on the list. If you live in an area prone to one or more of the three, you’ll need to buy a separate policy or a rider. In areas where hurricanes can pose a threat, you might also need to buy a separate rider to cover wind damage.  Ask your insurance agent about this extra coverage.  Gainesville is prone to hurricanes and some areas ﬂ  ood.

BudgetsBudgetsYou can’t find the right place to live until you know how much you 
are able to spend.  Here are some budget questions you should think about while touring a property:
To help you with your budget, OCL has a budget 
spreadsheet in the Gator Guide to Off Campus Life (page 7) and online at http://www.offcampus.ufl.edu/gator_guide. 
Your living environment plays a major factor in your 
overall happiness level.  Know what you want to get out of your living space and choose your location and roommate(s) accordingly.  Gainesville is home now so let Off Campus Life help you get the most out of your off-campus experience.

1What is the 
monthly rent?
2What’s included in that rent?  Utilities, gas, water, cable, Internet?
3What’s not included in rent?  What is the 
average monthly cost for gas, electric, 
water, garbage disposal?  If management doesn’t know, contact GRU at www.gru.com and they can give you average costs of utilities for the previous year.
4Want to have a pet?  Factor in the de-
posit and monthly cost for food, medi-
cal and grooming care.
5Don’t forget the insurance.  Before you sign your lease, call your insurance com-
pany and see how much it will cost month-ly to insure your apartment or house.
6Are you going to need fuel for your vehicle or are you going to use the bus?  
Factor transportation/car maintenance costs into your budget.
7How much will you spend monthly on groceries or on a meal plan?
8Have some fun!  Don’t spend so much on rent that you don’t have money for fun stuff.
9What do you spend on clothing, shoes and accessories? 
10How much money can you save every month?  It’s really good to save some money every month to cover unex-pected emergency expenses.  Even $20 a month saved is good.  Every little bit counts.WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 20, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, STUDENT LIVING GUIDE, 11

Can I Be Evicted If I Pay “My” Rent 
and My Roommates Don’t?
Usually.  Most leases provide that the tenants 
are jointly and severally liable for the entire rent. 
This means the landlord can evict you unless the full rent is paid.
It is possible for you to sue your roommates in 
small claims court to collect their share of the rent and utilities.  A written roommate agreement will 
be helpful in proving your case in court. 
 Given the difficulty of collecting money on a 
judgment quickly, the best thing you can do is obtain new roommates.So What If I Get Sued? I Have No Money!
Any judgment for money damages is enforceable for at least 20 years 
and earns interest. A judgment may be enforced by seizing your wages, 
bank accounts, or your personal property.  A judgment will also adversely 
affect your credit rating.
Application Deposits:  Never put 
down a deposit to hold an apartment 
unless you have a written agreement in-
dicating whether it is refundable.
Model Apartments:  Never sign a 
lease based upon a model. Insist on see-ing your actual apartment.
Cost:  Can you afford it? Even if your 
roommates leave?
Safety:  Inspect the locks on the 
doors and windows – is there a deadbolt 
on the front door? 
Do sliding glass doors have adequate 
locks to deter forced entry? Are the hallways and parking lots well lit? Make sure tree limbs and shrubs in front of the apartment are well trimmed. 
You can contact the Alachua County 
Sheriff’s Office or the Gainesville Police Department for information on crime in the area.Function:  At move-in, check all 
plumbing and appliances. Run water in sinks, showers and tubs, flush toilets, and 
check air conditioning and heating. 
Inventory:  Note all defects on the 
inventory sheet or check-in list signed by 
the landlord or an impartial witness. Pho-tograph or videotape the apartment at 
movi-in.
Appearance:  Is it clean? Do the 
carpets look worn or smell bad? Has the 
apartment been painted recently? Do the walls have nail holes? 
In some Gainesville neighborhoods, 
only three unrelated persons may live together. Check with the city if you plan on having more than two roommates.
Retain a copy of the lease and all at-
tachments or addendums to the lease for your records. Have all promised re-pairs and improvements written into the lease and signed by the landlord.  
Get clear written permission for any 
pets.What Should I Look For In An Apartment?
Information reprinted with permission by UF Student Legal ServicesWhat Should I Do 
Before I Sign a Lease?
DO
 Read the lease and 
make sure you understand it.
 Review a copy of the 
lease with an attorney prior 
to signing it.
 Expect to pay full rent, 
not just your share. This is what “joint and several” liability means, a term included or implied in nearly all leases. 
 Obtain a copy of the 
lease and all attachments or addendums to the lease, and put everything with your personal records.
 Have all promised re-
pairs and improvements writ-ten into the lease and signed by the landlord.
 Insist on seeing your ac-
tual unit.
 Get clear written per-
mission for any pets.
 Check for mainte-
nance responsibilities when renting a house or duplex.DON’T 
 Do not sign a 12-month 
lease unless you are willing to 
pay rent for 12 months.
 Do not sign a 12-month 
lease with roommates unless all roommates are willing to rent for 12 months.
 Do not have your par-
ents sign the lease or a paren-tal guarantee agreeing to be responsible for rent, if possible. See if the landlord will accept an additional security deposit instead.
 Do not sign a lease with 
automatic renewal clause.
 Do not sign a lease that 
gives the landlord unlimited access to the apartment with-out notice or consent.
 Do not sign a lease 
based upon a model apart-ment.
 Do not sign a lease be-
fore visiting the neighborhood at various times during the day, at night and on weekends.
 Do not sign a lease un-
til all agreements negotiated with the landlord are in writ-ing.Failure to pay rent is the quickest way to be evicted! The land-
lord will serve a notice demanding payment of rent or possession 
of the apartment. If you fail to comply with the demand within 
three days, excluding weekends and holidays, eviction proceed-
ings may be started. Neither surrender of the apartment or evic-
tion ends your liability for rent! You should contact an attorney 
immediately upon receipt of a three-day notice.What Can Happen 
If I Don’t Pay Rent?
Can I use My Security Deposit 
for the Last Month’s Rent?
No. Landlords can legally evict you for non-payment of rent even 
when your “security deposit” is equal to your last month’s rent. The 
purpose of the security deposit is to protect the landlord against damages to the apartment.WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 20, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, STUDENT LIVING GUIDE, 13
Getting Along14, STUDENT LIVING GUIDE, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 20, 2013
Getting AlongDo I Really Need Insurance 
For MY Personal Property?
Yes. Unless you are financially able to replace all your 
belongings, you should have insurance. Proper insur-
ance coverage will protect you against the loss of your 
valuables in most circumstances. Landlords are legally 
responsible for such losses only under very specific, lim-
ited circumstances that may be very difficult to prove in 
court. 
If you are a resident-relative of your parents, your per-
sonal property may be insured through their homeown-
er’s policy. Have your parents confirm the coverage in 
writing with their insurance agent. 
If coverage is not available through your parents’ 
homeowner’s policy, you may be able to purchase 
renter’s insurance. Even with insurance, there are cer-
tain precautions you should always take. Always lock 
your apartment securely even if you are only going next 
door. Never leave jewelry, cameras, cash, checkbooks, 
credit cards, electronics, or other valuables in plain 
view.My Landlord Refuses to Make Re-
pairs, What Can I Do?
You MA Y be able either to withhold your 
rent or terminate your lease if the problem 
constitutes a material breach of the lease or the Act. You must follow the exact re-quirements of the Act. 
 You must give the landlord a written no-
tice demanding the repairs be made in seven days. The notice must indicate an in-tent to terminate the lease or withhold rent if the repairs are not made.  
This is a complicated process and the le-
gal consequences are very serious. Do not attempt to terminate your lease or withhold rent without first obtaining legal advice.Can I Deduct 
Repair Costs 
From My Rent?
No. 
The Act does not autho-
rize you to make repairs or to recover the cost of such repairs. In fact, most apart-ment leases prohibit re-pairs by tenants. When the landlord refuses to make repairs, the Act gives you a qualified right to termi-nate the lease or withhold rent. As previously indicat-ed, you should consult an attorney before attempt-ing to terminate the lease or withhold rent.
Getting EvictedGetting Evicted
Can I Be Evicted For Any Other Reason?
Yes! Your lease can be terminated if you violate any lease terms, 
rules and regulations, or the Act. If your lease is terminated and you 
do not vacate the apartment, the landlord may file for your eviction immediately.
Termination begins with a 7-day notice.  Your options depend on 
whether the violations are classified as “curable” or “noncurable”.
If you receive either type of notice, you should contact an attorney. 
Neither termination of your lease, nor your eviction from the apart-ment ends your liability for rent!
Curable Violations:  
You will be given seven days to 
correct a curable violation. Cur-
able violations include unauthor-
ized pets, guests, parking, or the 
failure to keep the apartment 
clean and sanitary. If you repeat 
the violation within 12 months, 
you will not be given another 
chance.Noncurable Violations : 
The landlord may terminate your 
lease with a 7-day notice without 
giving you a chance to correct a 
noncurable violation. Noncurable 
violations include deliberate de-
struction or misuse of the landlord’s 
property or a continued, unrea-
sonable disturbance. What Exactly Is An Eviction?
An eviction is the formal end to your right to oc-
cupy the apartment. It does not end your duty to 
pay rent. 
An eviction starts with a Summons. You must 
file an Answer within 5 days. Contact an attor-ney immediately.
If the court rules against you, a judgment for 
possession of the apartment, unpaid rent, late fees, interest, court costs and attorney’s fees will be entered for the landlord. The sheriff will post a notice at the apartment that requires you to va-cate within 24 hours. If you do not vacate within 24 hours, the sheriff will remove you and your per-sonal property from the apartment.
What Are My Duties 
As A Tenant?
 First, last and always, PAY RENT!
 Comply with all other lease terms.
 Comply with all rules and regulations.
 Comply with housing and health codes.
 Comply with all zoning restrictions.
 Keep the apartment clean and sanitary.

Check the Off-Campus Life website at http://www.dso.ufl.edu/offcam-
pus. Check bulletin boards around campus and classified ads as additional 
sources. 
Discuss with potential roommates preferences in food, music, personal 
habits, sleeping and study hours, friends and finances. An open and frank appraisal of each other’s likes, dislikes, and expectations will increase the chances of an enjoyable shared living experience. A written roommate agreement is advisable.

Getting OutGetting Out
There is no time period established by the Act. You should not sign a lease that pro-
vides for automatic renewals of requires you to give the landlord a notice of nonre-
newal. If you do sign such a lease, you must strictly comply with the notice requirements imposed by the lease.   There are some limits to the enforceability of these clauses. Contact an attorney if you have any questions.
If the lease does not specify otherwise, renewals are a matter of general contract 
law. The landlord cannot force you to renew prior to the end of your lease.  However, if you do not renew by the landlord’s “deadline,” the landlord may rent your apartment to someone else. What Steps Can I Take To Protect My Security Deposit?
When you take occupancy of the apartment, complete a thorough written inventory of the 
apartment’s condition and have the landlord or an impartial witness sign the inventory. Make 
sure you keep a copy of the inventory. This helps protect you from the landlord claiming you caused pre-existing damage.
When you move out, clean the apartment completely and thoroughly. Some landlords pro-
vide a checklist outlining the cleaning they expect you to do. Keep all your receipts for clean-ing supplies and professional carpet cleaning as evidence.
Before you leave, ask the landlord to inspect the apartment with you. Complete a move-out 
checklist and make sure the landlord signs and dates it. Use an impartial witness if the landlord is not available or refuses your request. Move-in and move-out photographs or videotape are strongly recommended in case there is a dispute.
Can I Break My Lease Because…
I am graduating?   No!
My roommate left?    No!
I cannot afford the rent?  No!
I need to work this summer?  No!
The neighborhood is unsafe?  No!
Under the Act, you can only terminate the lease 
if the landlord is materially violating your lease or the 
Act. You should obtain legal advice before attempt-ing to terminate your lease. In many cases, the best thing you can do is find replacement tenants.
Information reprinted with permission by UF Student Legal ServicesDoes the Law Require 
Interest Payments on 
Security Deposits?
Landlords must hold security deposits 
in one of three methods. Two methods of 
holding the deposits require interest to be paid. The method which does not require interest payment is the one most landlords use. The landlord is required to inform you in writing how your deposit is being held, where it is held, and whether you will re-ceive interest.
Can I Sublet My Apartment?
Usually. the landlord cannot unreasonably withhold consent to an assignment or sublease. 
The landlord may require potential replacement tenants to submit an application including 
a credit check. The landlord may also charge a reasonable sublet fee even when you pro-vide the replacement tenants. Normally you remain liable under your lease if the replace-ment tenants do not pay rent or damage the apartment. Some landlords will release you from the obligations of your lease. If you are being released, get it in writing.

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
When George Zimmerman 
and his girlfriend called 911 in 
the heat of a domestic dispute, they almost certainly knew they were not just talking to the emergency dispatcher. In the age of Twitter and the 24-hour news cycle, experts say a call to central dispatch can quickly become public and is often manipulated to spin a story or even lay the groundwork for a criminal defense.
“There re-
ally has been what I would call a multi-year training program in place, frank-ly” to use 911 calls strategi-cally, says 
former Massachusetts pros-ecutor Wendy Murphy. “And folks, especially people who understand high-proﬁ  le crimes and the nature of evidence and the rules of evidence and do-mestic abuse generally, they (know) the power of a 911 call to change not only the trajec-tory of the case, but to change public opinion and to affect the jury pool.”
On Monday, 27-year-old 
Samantha Scheibe called Semi-nole County dispatchers and accused Zimmerman, the for-mer neighborhood watchman, of pointing a shotgun at her, smashing a table and pushing her. Around the same time, the Sanford man made a 911 call of his own, stating that he did not threaten Scheibe, and it was she who had broken the table.
When defense attorney 
Frank Rubino heard the Zim-merman recording on televi-sion, his gut reaction was: This sounds staged.
“Didn’t Zimmerman sound 
way too calm?” says the Miami lawyer who represented former Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega. “He knows well — and everybody else knows — that those tapes are admissible in court, and it’s a way for him to make a positive statement on a very bad situation.”
This is the third time since 
Zimmerman’s shooting of a black teenager in February 2012 that 911 calls have played a ma-jor role in the man’s future. Not long after his July acquittal in the killing of 17-year-old Tray-von Martin, Shellie Zimmer-man initially told a dispatcher her estranged husband had smashed the iPad on which she was recording him, and was threatening her and her father with a gun.
Murphy said victims began 
to think “strategically” about using 911 calls as a way to have their accusations entered into the record without necessarily having to testify, says Murphy, now an adjunct professor in Boston.
Rubino says it behooved 
Zimmerman to come across as unexcited as possible.
“It’s like he was trying to 
be really calm and saying, ‘My crazy girlfriend is doing all this stuff,’” Rubino says. “I think he was trying to create a defense.”
In the September incident, 
Shellie Zimmerman later ac-knowledged she did not see a gun, and no charges were ﬁ  led. This time, Zimmerman, 30, faces a felony charge of aggra-vated assault, as well as misde-meanor counts of battery and criminal mischief.
Murphy says the unwrit-
ten rule in such cases has been “whoever calls ﬁ  rst wins.” But because the police know people can be crafty, she says, “they don’t weigh that factor as much as they used to in determining which of two people is the real victim.”

Celebrating UF’s International 
Education Week, a series of events 
are being featured on campus to broaden UF’s global footprint. 
The theme of the week sur-
rounds international engagement and includes musical performanc-es, international ﬁ  lm screenings, educational lectures and a chance drawing through Friday.
David Sammons, dean of the 
international center, said the week is a national program celebrated at universities all over the U.S. 
Sammons said UF has more than 
6,000 international students from 137 countries.
“The University of Florida 
claims to be a world-class institu-tion, and we are,” Sammons said. “I think that being world-class means being globally engaged and con-nected.”
Sammons said celebrating in-
ternational education is one path to achieving top-10 status as a uni-versity. “It’s really meant to raise up the 
importance of international edu-cation as a component of modern education and to recognize that well-educated people understand the rest of the world and how it works,” Sammons said.
Mabel Cardec, outreach coor-
dinator in the international center, said one major draw of the activi-ties of the week is to give students a taste of different cultures. A martial arts performance by Cuong Nhu will be held today, and lessons in Hebrew writing style by Michal Katz will be given every day.
“International Education Week 
opens a window to the world for many people,” she said. “Many students come to UF and just dedi-cate themselves to their studies and don’t think about the rest of the world.”
Cardec said the Florida Museum 
of Natural History is making a spe-cial offer to UF staff and faculty for the week. This week, admission to the Butterﬂ  y Rainforest will be $6 with a valid Gator 1 Card. 
Broward Dining Hall is also 
serving dishes each day this week from countries such as India, Viet-nam and China.
Sahar Basaria, president of Belly 
Gators, and her belly dancing group performed four songs at the kickoff of the week on Monday, including a contemporary performance of Lorde’s “Royals.”
Basaria, a 20-year-old UF crimi-
nology and psychology junior, said she believes it’s important to cel-ebrate global awareness in order to promote tolerance and bring to-gether different cultures.
“All cultures are individually in 
and of themselves beautiful, and it’s important to understand and respect and cooperate with other cultures instead of being focused on the culture you were raised in,” she said.

To The Girl With The Beautiful Blue Eyes
                        and Little Blue Eyes: This will be the first Homecoming and Growl in 10 years, that we are not able to go.  Little Blue Eyes, however, will be there.  The three of us were together in Gainesville last week and we had a great time.   Homecoming is very special to us.  It marks the beginning 33 years ago, and it makes me sad to not be there together.  During this time, I know how lucky I am to have both of you in my life.  I could not make it without the love and support of both of you, my wife and daughter.  I love you both so much.  Next year, when Little Blue Eyes will be a "Super Senior", we'll make it the best ever.                               ILY,                                     Liarface

Carlos Miranda is 
coming on strong for the Florida cross country team. Read the story on page 14. Runner honored
Florida cross country senior Mark Parrish was named the 2013 USTFCCCA South Region Men’s Athlete of the Year on Tuesday.Kan Li / Alligator Staff
Kasey Hill attempts a shot during Florida’s 67-53 victory against Southern on Monday in the O’Connell Center. Hill suffered a high ankle sprain in the game.
LANDON WATNICK
Alligator Staff Writer @LandonWatnick
It was supposed to be a regular move 
in Kasey Hill’s repertoire. 
After Florida forced a turnover about 
two minutes into the second half, Hill 
drove down the right side of the lane through two Southern defenders and drew a foul. 
The freshman point guard had been 
thriving in transition all Monday night, with eight points on three layups and a floater coming before the play.
But during this layup attempt, Hill’s 
left foot planted awkwardly, and his an-kle twisted inward. The McDonald’s All-American then let out a howl that was heard throughout the O’Connell Center.Hill suffered a high left ankle sprain 
under the same basket that former Ken-tucky big man Nerlens Noel’s season ended last February when he suffered a torn ACL. 
Florida coach Billy Donovan said af-
ter the No. 16 Gators’ 67-53 win against the Jaguars that Hill will miss at least a month of action. X-rays on Hill’s ankle came back negative Tuesday with no bro-ken bones or torn ligaments.
Without their floor general, the Gators 
are in a predicament. Hill injury problematic

Standing on their last leg, the Gators 
turned to Leon Orr.
Down 16-14 against South Carolina with 
4:45 remaining in the game, Trey Burton 
lofted a fourth-and-13 pass out of a punt for-mation to a double-covered Orr, who got his hands on the football.
But the ball dropped to the turf, quickly 
followed by a frustrated Orr’s fists. The Gamecocks used the turnover on downs to burn more time off the clock and tack on a fi-nal field goal to increase their lead to five in a 19-14 victory.
“I wouldn’t necessarily say I’m mad at 
myself, but I’m disappointed I didn’t come up with it,” Orr said. “It was a big play and we needed it, so I’m pretty disappointed I didn’t come up with the catch.”
Throwing to a defensive tackle with the 
game on the line appeared to be an odd deci-sion, but coach Will Muschamp trusted Orr’s hands. The New Port Richey native played tight end during his days at Gulf High.
Although the try ended in failure, Orr was 
happy to receive a chance to make a play.
“It’s been a long time since I’ve been out 
there and jumped up there and tried to make a catch like that so it was very exciting,” Orr said. “I really think it was something I really needed to do just to let people know I am ath-letic and I can do those things.”
On the defensive side of the ball, Orr deliv-
ered for Florida. He recorded two tackles for a loss on Saturday night, including a sack of Gamecocks quarterback Connor Shaw.
In the absence of injured defensive tackle 
Dominique Easley, Orr is enjoying his best statistical season. His effort at Williams-Brice Stadium helped him take the lead among Gators defensive tackles with 20 tackles, 4.5 tackles for a loss and 2.5 sacks this season.
Orr said Easley’s continuing support and 
friendship have served as motivation in 2013.
“[Easley] told me to just go out there and 
play with heart, you know what I’m saying? You know the next play could be your last play, so you’ve got to go out there and give your all,” Orr said. 
“That’s why I never stop. I’m trying to be 
as excited and ready to go as possible because Orr offers versatility for GatorsFootbALL

Meet Christian Provancha.
Never heard of him? That’s 
not surprising; the closest Provancha has ever gotten to a college football field is the sideline. 
But with starting quarter-
back Jeff Driskel (leg) out for the season and second-string signal-caller Tyler Murphy (shoulder) questionable after missing Florida’s 19-14 loss to South Carolina on Saturday, Provancha is as close to play-ing as he will likely ever be.
Before the Gators’ loss to the 
Gamecocks, Florida’s coach-ing staff moved Provancha to second on the depth chart be-hind redshirt freshman Skyler Mornhinweg, who was mak-ing his first career start.
One missed block or one 
determined linebacker could knock Mornhinweg out, and the 6-foot-6 Provancha would take the reins.“Everyone hopes to be in 
this situation where you have the opportunity to contribute, but not like this,” Provancha said. “You want to work your way up the ladder with skill. We’ve been plagued by injury and stuff, but I was just really happy to be able to show that I’m there for the team.”
Until recently, the redshirt 
junior’s job has been to signal plays to the quarterback — a literal signal caller. 
He has served ancillary 
roles, such as manning the scout team and imitating other team’s quarterbacks without much chance to show off his own skills.
“I’ve done [former Tennes-
see quarterback Tyler Bray] in the past,” Provancha said. “I mean any tall, white quarter-backs out there.”
But coaches moved other 
players into the scout-team role so they could develop at the position. 
Even now, Provancha is 
only the second-string quarter-back because the Florida staff does not want to burn fresh-man Max Staver’s redshirt.
“Not at this stage,” offen-
sive coordinator Brent Pease said of Staver playing.
So, while Murphy contin-
ues to recover from his shoul-der injury, the second-string job belongs to Provancha.
“It was a little nerve-wrack-
ing,” Provancha said. “Being a [redshirt junior], I’m supposed to be able to handle it.”
Provancha did not come to 
Florida for its athletics. Like so many other UF students, he came to the school for aca-demics and because a family member already attended the

When the season started, Carlos 
Miranda did not expect to be a contribu-
tor on Florida’s cross country team.
“Honestly, I didn’t even know I was 
going to be able to be on the varsity team coming in,” Miranda said. “I wasn’t that conﬁ  dent because all the guys were re-ally good here.”
But as the season progressed, the Na-
ples freshman became a valuable asset for the Gators. 
He is Florida’s only runner to score in 
all six meets this season.
“With freshmen coming in, consis-
tency can be tough because the training is such a higher level than their used to,” coach Paul Spangler said. 
“It’s just a matter of how their body is 
going to adapt, and he’s just been consis-tent all year.”
Miranda’s times have improved in ev-
ery meet this year.  
His time in 5K races improved from 15:32.14 at the Western Carolina Invi-tational on Aug. 30 to a 15:17.60 at the FLRunners.com Invitational four weeks later.
The ﬁ  rst-year runner has also broken 
the 25-minute barrier in an 8K race twice this season, with his fastest time coming at the Southeastern Conference Champi-onships on Nov. 1. 
On UF’s Mark Bostick Golf Course, 
Miranda ran a 24:55.40 en route to earn-ing a spot on the SEC All-Freshman team.
“I was pretty happy to break 25 on our 
course,” the three-time SEC Freshman of the Week said. 
“I wanted to run somewhere close to 
the 24:30s, but I’ll take a sub-25 on our course any day.”
At the NCAA South Regional Cham-
pionships on Friday, Miranda ran his ﬁ  rst 10K race as a Gator in 30:50.05, good enough for a 29th overall ﬁ  nish out of 173 runners.
“For Carlos to run that well, that’s 
a really good thing for the program,”  Mark Parrish said. 
“Being a senior, I like to see some of 
the younger guys run fast and perform well. The 10K, that’s a hard distance for a freshman to run, so to be able to see that there is some young talent on the team is exciting.”
With the NCAA Championships ap-
proaching, Miranda doesn’t plan to slow down any time soon.
“I felt unstoppable and felt like I 
could have kept on going,” he said about running at the regional race. “I deﬁ  nitely want to help out, at least try and crack the 200 spot, maybe help the team get a top-20 ﬁ  nish (or) top-10 ﬁ  nish would be nice.”
Added Parrish: “I think Carlos has a 
couple more seconds that he can cut off his time. It was his ﬁ  rst 10K, so obviously it was a learning experience for him.”you never know when it’s going to be 
your last play.”
Fulwood emerging: Ahmad Fulwood 
has not wasted any time making his mark in Gainesville. 
The Jacksonville native has tallied 11 
receptions for 92 yards and a touchdown in limited action this season, nearly out-performing every other UF freshman wideout since 2008 combined.
Robert Clark in 2010, Latroy Pittman 
in 2012 and Demarcus Robinson this sea-son have a combined 14 receptions for 98 yards. 
“Ahmad has come on and put himself 
in the rotation and done a good job,” of-fensive coordinator Brent Pease said. “You know he’s, what I see from him, he’s ﬁ  -nally catching up to the speed of the game and gotten more consistent catching.”
Meanwhile, Robinson has yet to make 
the impact expected following his stand-out performance during fall camp. 
Rivals.com’s ﬁ  fth-ranked wide receiver 
in the Class of 2013  has only ﬁ  ve catches for 23 yards this season.
“Demarcus is inconsistent,” Pease 
said. “It’s just a situation where he’s got to continue to improve and get comfortable and understand what he’s being taught fundamentally.”
Gainesville native Chris Thompson has 
yet to make an impact, but he has caught the attention of Pease. He came out of Gainesville High as a three-star prospect.
“(I’m) happy with what Chris is do-
ing,” Pease said. 
“He’s catching the ball well. He’s run-
ning well, playing fast and you can see some explosiveness.”14, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 20, 2013

NOTES , from page 13Fulwood eyes 
increased role for FloridaCROSS COUNTRYFreshman making unexpected contributionsschool. 
Provancha’s brother, Ian, went 
to Florida and is currently looking 
to enroll in UF’s medical school. 
For Provancha, athletics come 
second to academics — a rarity in today’s college-football atmo-sphere that values on-ﬁ  eld pro-duction over grade-point aver-ages.
“As long as I was here for aca-
demics, I would have been hap-py,” he said.
Provancha did not have many 
schools vying for his services on the football ﬁ  eld. 
He said he had a scholarship 
offer from Florida A&M, but other schools did not show much inter-est.
ESPN ranked Provancha as a 
one-star prospect — the 167th best quarterback in his class.
“I think ESPN had me at ‘de-
ceptively athletic,’” he said. “So, I’ll throw in a spin move every now and then.“I’ve got a little more speed 
than people give me credit and a little more moves than people give me credit.”
His athleticism allowed for a 
brief move to wide receiver last season — a change Provancha was not thrilled with. 
“I came here as a quarterback, 
was a quarterback three years,” he said. 
“We were low on receivers, 
and I showed them what I got, so they put me at wide receiver. 
“I guess I scared some people 
with the roster, a [6-foot-6] receiv-er. But I’m still pretty slow.”
Unlike most players, Provan-
cha does not expect to play. 
Second string is already be-
yond what he expected to reach during his career. 
Florida has produced quarter-
backs such as Danny Wuerffel, Rex Grossman and Tim Tebow. Why would a walk-on get a shot?
“Hopefully, the only situation 
that would happen is if we’re up by a decent amount of points,” he said, “and I don’t know if that’s a possibility. 
“Hopefully, that’s the way it 
happens, if it does. Other than that, before last week Skyler had as many snaps as me, so he’s got to get his reps, too.” WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 20, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 15

FOOTBALL , from page 13UF now lacking true point guard
“It’s a part of the game,” Donovan said. 
“We’ll have to ﬁ  nd some different ways to com-
pensate for his absence.”
For the time being, Florida will have to do so 
without a natural point guard on its shorthand-ed roster. Its best options to ﬁ  ll in at point guard are either injured or unavailable. 
Senior Scottie Wilbekin, last year’s starter at 
point guard, is still suspended indeﬁ  nitely and will miss UF’s matchup against Middle Tennes-see on Thursday. 
Donovan also revealed after the game that 
guard Dillon Graham (bone spurs) will undergo surgery on his hips next week and miss the re-mainder of the season.
Eli Carter (leg), who has played sparingly 
because he has not yet reached full strength, is mulling a medical redshirt. 
“We deﬁ  nitely need him, but not at the ex-
pense of burning his year,” Donovan said of Carter. “That’s a real, real hard one for me to swallow as a coach when a guy’s playing on one leg. He’s probably going to see how much more he can do, but I had him at the point out there. 
“He was out there at half-court. He almost 
lost the ball like three times. It looked like he couldn’t even plant and push off, and he looked hobbled. So I feel bad for him. Selﬁ  shly, could we just use his body for ﬁ  ve, six minutes to buy some time? Yes, but … I think we owe him the opportunity to get himself fully healthy and play again.”
Without those players to provide effective 
minutes at point guard, sophomores Michael Frazier II and DeVon Walker — who has com-mitted eight turnovers in four games — will likely handle the task. 
Frazier thrives in catch-and-shoot situations 
on the wings and corners but will likely have to run the ﬂ  oor as the starting point guard Thurs-day night. 
“I think I could do ﬁ  ne with it,” Frazier said. 
“I played a little bit of point guard in high school. I played it in a couple games, so I’m pretty com-fortable with it.”
Donovan also said he might experiment with 
Dorian Finney-Smith playing at the point, al-though the redshirt sophomore forward has not practiced much at that position this year.
“We’re going to probably have to do some 
different things,” Donovan said. “We’re go-ing to have to make some lineup adjustments, changes. … We’re going to probably have to have multiple guys handle the ball. I think we’ve got to be able to ﬂ  ow on offense, function, once we get into half court.”HILL , from page 13

GATORS IN THE NFL
LANDON WATNICK
Alligator Staff Writer@LandonWatnick
With Week 11 of the NFL season in the books, 
here are a few former Gators who made the most 
tangible impact for their respective teams.
Percy Harvin, wide receiver: After waiting 
10 games to make his debut with the Seattle Seahawks, Percy Harvin (hip) ﬁ  nally saw the ﬁ  eld Sunday. 
And in a limited role, he 
was explosive. 
Although he caught only 
one pass for 17 yards on his sole target of the afternoon, Harvin returned a kick 58 yards during the Seahawks’ 41-20 win against the Min-nesota Vikings — Harvin’s 
former team. 
His sole catch was an acrobatic grab over 
Vikings cornerback Chris Cook. The former Gators receiver reeled in the ball with his right hand, juggled it and eventually secured it with his left arm. 
Harvin revealed after the game that in ad-
dition to having hip surgery during the off-season, he also underwent an appendectomy late last year. During the procedure, doctors discovered that Harvin had a benign tumor on his appendix.
“I’ve been through a lot besides the hip sur-
gery,” Harvin told ESPN. “So it was an enjoy-able feeling to get back out there. I wanted to see where I was at. Today was the test every-one wanted to see. I don’t see any more set-backs. I’m looking to take off from here.”
Joe Haden, cornerback: The Cleveland 
Browns suffered their sixth loss of the season in a 41-20 defeat to the Cincinnati Bengals Sun-day, but Joe Haden had a game to remember.
During the loss, Haden had two intercep-
tions in the ﬁ  rst quarter. The ﬁ  rst, which he returned for 15 yards to the Cincinnati 14-yard line, came on a ﬁ  rst and 10 and resulted in a Browns ﬁ  eld goal on the ensuing drive.
Fewer than two minutes later, Haden 
scored the ﬁ  rst touchdown of the game when he picked off a pass from Bengals quarterback Andy Dalton and returned it 29 yards into the end zone to put the Browns ahead 13-0. Dal-ton’s pass was intended for A.J. Green, but Haden made the read and ran down the left sideline untouched into the end zone. 
Notes: During the Chicago Bears’ 23-20 
overtime victory against the Baltimore Ravens, linebacker Jon Bostic picked off a pass from Ravens signal caller Joe Flacco at the 50-yard line. The Bears tacked on a ﬁ  eld goal on their next drive to reduce their deﬁ  cit to 17-13 at halftime. 
During his team’s 24-16 loss to the Philadel-
phia Eagles, Washington Redskins tight end Jordan Reed suffered a concussion. He is ques-tionable for Monday’s matchup against the San Francisco 49ers. Reed had one catch for 12 yards in the game.Harvin enjoys successful debut

Caeleb Dressel is being hailed as 
one of the best sprint prospects ever 
despite having never suited up for a college team.
Dressel, from Clay High and the 
Bolles swim club in Jacksonville, com-mitted to Florida on Tuesday after vis-iting Gainesville during the weekend.
The high school senior is one of the 
top recruits in the 2014 class and owns the national high school 50-yard free-style record at 19.29 seconds — just .17 seconds slower than senior Brad deBorde’s school-record time. Dressel also swims the 100-yard free in 43.29 seconds, making him a more than ad-equate replacement for deBorde after he graduates. 
At the Junior World Champion-
ships over the summer, Dressel placed third in the 50-yard free and took ﬁ  rst in the 100-yard free while setting a new championship record.
He will be a second-generation 
Gator, following in his father’s foot-steps, assuming he stays true to his commitment.
The high school senior has not 
signed his national letter of intent.
Divers surging: Florida’s swimming 
and diving teams have been among the top teams in the nation during the fall season. 
The men’s team is currently sitting 
at the No. 1 spot, and the women are at No. 3, and it isn’t just the swimmers propelling them to those high rank-ings.
A bright spot for the Gators this 
year has been in women’s diving. They have totaled six event wins and 88 to-tal points through the ﬁ  rst four dual meets, compared to no wins and 42 total points after four dual meets last year.
Sophomore Kahlia Warner, who 
transferred to UF in the spring, ac-counts for a big part of that improve-ment. She has contributed ﬁ  ve wins and 58 points this season.
Men’s div-
ing has im-proved after a rough open-
ing in the ﬁ  rst two dual meets. A slow start that saw only one win through the ﬁ  rst two dual meets was followed by three wins and 37 points in the other two meets this fall.
Redshirt sophomore Zach Hernan-
dez has been a key player in Florida’s success. He picked up three wins and totaled 31 points in the last two meets against Alabama and Georgia.
But the men are without redshirt se-
nior Chris Jones, who is still recovering from shoulder surgery. 
Jones had the best performance of 
his career at NCAA Zone Diving on the platform, ﬁ  nishing in eighth place in the ﬁ  nals. Diving coach Donnie Craine said he is hopeful to have Jones back by SECs in February. Florida adds top recruit
