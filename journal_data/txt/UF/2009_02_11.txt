Sixteen UF students were in-
volved in DUI incidents since July 
1, the beginning of the fiscal school year.
This year’s student DUI statis-
tics are below pace compared to years before, but Assistant Dean of Students Chris Loschiavo said he 
expects the number to rise before 
the second half of the spring se-mester since people tend to drink more close to graduation.
There were 65 UF 
students referred to UF’s office of Student 
Conflict and Conduct 
Resolution for DUI’s, during the 2007-2008 school year, Loschiavo 
said. 
When a student is referred by a 
law enforcement agency for a DUI, the student must meet with one 
staff member or attend a student 
conduct committee hearing.In the meetings and hearings, 
evidence against the student is presented and disciplinary options are discussed, Loschiavo said.

A former associate professor in UF’s Levin College 
of Law filed a lawsuit against UF last week alleging she was forced to resign in 2007 because of sex and race dis-crimination.
In one instance, she alleges she was talking with a 
black student when a male colleague  pushed her into the classroom’s whiteboard as class was about to start.
Sherrie Russell-Brown, who was hired in 2001 as 
an assistant professor of law, filed suit in federal court against UF’s Board of Trustees, the College of Law and its dean, Bob Jerry.
Russell-Brown, who is black, alleges that the bulk 
of the discrimination occurred after she returned from England, where she was studying for a degree in public 
international law at the University of Oxford while on a 
two-year leave of absence. While in England, she wrote e-mails to faculty in the law school detailing episodes of discrimination. When she returned in January 2007, she found her office a mess and learned that her personal mail and e-mails had been accessed in her absence, she said. 
She claims her colleagues completely shunned her 
and their hostility transferred to the students. One white 
male student sent her a threatening e-mail the day after 
the Virginia Tech killings, leading her to cancel the last day of class for the semester, she said.Ex-prof. claims

The U.S. Senate voted to approve the $838 
billion economic stimulus bill on Tuesday, 
but UF experts have identified aspects of 
the recovery program they would like to see 
changed.
Michael Cook, a professor with the Rinker 
School of Building Construction, said the bill should focus more on building public schools than on infrastructure projects, which include 
improving highways and bridges.
Cook said more people will appreciate a 
stimulus plan that spends money on schools rather than infrastructure because the build-ing of schools involves a larger sector of the population.
“In my opinion, there is really no substi-
tute for dollars spent on education,” he said.
UF may indeed now have more money to spend.
Doug Waldo, an as-
sociate professor in UF’s 
department of economics, said funds from the plan that are allocated to Florida would hopefully help re-duce UF’s budget cuts.
But Waldo said govern-
ment officials should focus 
on bank reform before finalizing the stimulus plan. 
The plan will only be useful if the prob-
lems in the banking sector are dealt with first, Waldo said.
However, the plan may have a useful ef-
fect on Florida’s agricultural industries.
Tom Spreen, chairman of UF’s food and 
resource economics department, said if the plan works, it could help raise the prices of UF experts call for change to parts of stimulus planNewsLocal

UF and University of Kentucky battle for blood donations
UF and Kentucky fans were fighting a bloody battle nearly a 
week before the men’s basketball game.
LifeSouth Community Blood Centers in Gainesville and Ken-
tucky Blood Centers hosted a competition from Feb. 2 to Feb. 9 to 
determine who could donate the most blood prior to the game.
Kentucky was proclaimed the winner of the blood drive during 
halftime of the men’s basketball game Tuesday night with 2,366 do-nations, topping UF’s 2,173 donations. 
This is the first year that LifeSouth has held a competition dur-

Fla. rampage followed

JUPITER, Fla. (AP) — Police in 
South Florida say a woman fired 
at drivers on Interstate 95 and 
bludgeoned her grandmother to death after trying to check into a 
psychiatric hospital in Georgia.
Amy Kern of St. Marys, Ga., 
is being held on two first-degree murder charges.
Kern told investigators that 
a state-run psychiatric hospital in Savannah, Ga., wouldn’t ad-
mit her early Saturday. She then drove to South Florida.
Police say Kern intended to 
kill her father, but he wasn’t home. She allegedly stole a gun 
from his house and fired at other 
drivers on her way to an aunt’s home in Palm Beach Gardens.
According to police, Kern shot 
her aunt’s boyfriend before driv-ing to Jupiter and beating her 
grandmother to death with a tire 
iron.
Kern’s fiancé says the 30-year-
old mother of an infant “made 
every attempt she could to get 
help.”

Man robs local bank
A man robbed a Gainesville 
bank Tuesday by discreetly ap-
proaching a teller and handing 
her a threatening note.  
The robbery was at the Cam-
pus Credit Union Bank at 1200 S.W. Fifth Ave.
“She did exactly what 
we would have wanted her to do,” said Gainesville Po-lice Department spokesman 
Keith Kameg. “She gave him 
an undisclosed amount of money, and he left walking 
in the northerly direction.” 
Kameg said the man was so dis-creet that the witnesses in the 
bank didn’t even know a rob-
bery was taking place.
The man, described as be-
ing bald and in his forties, was wearing a gray shirt and sun-glasses.

Fla. school sued over
refusing gay-straight club 
JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) 
— Two Florida high school 
students on Tuesday sued their 
school board because they were not allowed to form a club that 
promotes the tolerance of gays.
The American Civil Liber-
ties Union of Florida filed the suit Tuesday in federal court 
on behalf of Yulee High School students Hannah Page, a fresh-
man, and Jacob Brock, a junior.
The lawsuit claims viola-
tions of the First Amendment and the Federal Equal Access 
Act.
The act requires schools to 
grant access and recognition to a Gay-Straight Alliance and other groups if the school al-
lows any extracurricular group 
to meet on campus, said ACLU attorney Robert F. Rosenwald.
The lawsuit seeks a prelimi-
nary injunction to allow the club to meet at Yulee High while the 
case makes it way to trial.
Page said the group just 
wants to meet like others do.WHAT’S HAPPENING

n ABOUT 4,000 PEOPLE ATTENDED.
By MAE BASIRATMAND
Alligator Contributing Writer 
 
Nearly 4,000 people flocked to the O’Connell 
Center Tuesday night to see Ne-Yo, an artist 
known for his R&B and pop stylings.
Audience members, many of them women 
wearing stilettos and sequined tops, cheered as the opening acts heated up the anticipation for 
Ne-Yo’s performance.
UF’s Student Government Productions and 
Black Student Union presented the concert as 
part of Black History Month.
Electric Red, a female R&B band, opened by 
dancing provocatively on stage. The crowd re-sponded with screams as the women used their microphones as if they were shot glasses. 
Solo artist Musiq Soulchild followed, dressed 
in a gray suit and sunglasses. He addressed the 
crowd between his soulful stylings.
“What’s good in the ‘ville, y’all?” he said. 
Audience members jumped to their feet when 
Ne-Yo rose up out of a trap door in the middle of the stage and started singing his 2007 hit, “Be-
cause of You.”
While he performed songs off of his most 
recent album, “Year of the Gentleman,” Ne-Yo flirted with members of the audience by throw-
ing red roses into the crowd.
He interacted with his female backup dancers 
as he moved around stage, eventually taking a break to introduce himself to the audience. 
“How ‘bout them Gators?” he said.   The stage was simple, with deep blue and 
purple lighting and sparkling lights in the backdrop.
Members of the audience 
mouthed the lyrics to his songs as he smoothed his hand over his top hat and spun around, a move that received screams 
from the audience.   
Many attendees said they 
came by just to enjoy the show, 
which cost $10 per ticket for UF students.
Khelia Johnson, a fourth-year telecommunica-
tion management major, came for the music.
“I want to see him dancing out on stage,” she 
said. “I hope it’s good. I saw his performance on 
B.E.T. Honors and it was weak. I just want to see 
the dancing.”
UF Marine Corps recruiter Armondo Vickers 
bought tickets as an early Valentine’s Day pres-
ent for his wife, Shretha.
“We just want to have a good time. It’s a re-
laxed atmosphere,” Vickers said. “It’s more for her.”  R&B act Ne-Yo entertains UF
The city of Gainesville and 
Alachua County want you to 
scoop the poop. 
Alachua County commission-
ers approved a $40,655 addition 
to the Alachua County Environ-
mental Protection Department’s budget Tuesday for a pet waste public education program.
“Scoop it, Bag it, Trash it!,” 
aims to encourage residents to clean up after their pets and to educate them on the environ-mental and health dangers of not 
doing so, according to the agenda 
item.
The campaign will spread the 
word through commercials, post-ers, veterinarian offices and bag dispensers at public events.
The  city of Gainesville is 
funding the project, according to the county’s Web site.Throughout the county, pet 
waste has become an environ-mental concern because of the fe-cal coliform bacteria that is spread to waterways through runoff, ac-
cording to the agenda item.
Fecal coliforms live in the 
warm in-
testines of a n i m a l s and are a strong in-
dicator of the presence of fecal matter in water. Total maximum 
daily loads for the bacteria have 
been found at Hogtown Creek, Sweetwater Branch and Tumblin Creek, according to the agenda.
In addition, Hatchet Creek, 
Little Hatchet Creek and Possum Creek are on the 2008 Impaired Waters List for fecal coliform.

Harmonious “oohs” and “aahs” filled a 
Santa Fe College music practice room Tues-
day night as Gainesville’s Barbergators Cho-rus held their last rehearsal before Valentine’s Day.
Barbershop-style quartets, dressed in 
bright orange jackets and shiny blue vests, will be available to croon to your gal or fella Friday and Saturday in the ‘20s and ‘30s vocal style. The quartets can deliver the valentine to your sweetheart’s work, home or anywhere else in Gainesville. 
“It’s a great fund-raiser, but it’s also good 
to get out in the community and good to be 
seen,” Barbergator Travis Crew said. “It’s a 
different kind of gift that you don’t see often — you don’t see four guys in tuxedos just showing up at your job and singing with ev-eryone looking.”
The singing valentines go for the tune of 
$50 and include a flower, a personalized val-entine card, two songs and an instant photo with the quartet.
“We have plenty of spots open, lots of 
availability,” said Barbergators musical di-rector Dave Jacobs.
The chorus had scheduled more singing 
valentines by this time last year and think more people will order valentines as the holiday approaches, said Barbergator Mike Roth.
“Everybody is always last minute about 
Valentine’s Day,” Roth said. “I always was. Why shouldn’t anybody else be?”
Last year the chorus performed 30 singing 
valentines. 
“What’s fun is really surprising someone 
who  has no idea that it’s coming,” Crew said.
One quartet from the chorus sang to a 
woman who worked at Nationwide Insur-
ance, and all the employees on her floor lis-
tened in on the singing valentine, Crew said. 
The chorus, ranging from 20- to 80-year-
olds, sings turn-of-the-century old-time love songs and this year will perform “Let Me Call You Sweetheart” and “Heart of My Heart.” 
While the choir wants to get the message 
of the song across, for most of the singers it’s more about the harmony. It’s more of being a fan of the style, the way the chords are and the way it makes you feel even when you’re not familiar with it, Crew said.4, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 11, 2009

If the student is found guilty 
for drinking and driving, he or she will probably be suspended from 
school for a semester, he said.
Students might also be required 
to attend traffic school, complete 
service hours and write a reflection or research paper.
UF Police Lt. Stacy Ettel said 
UPD has two strategies for catch-ing drunken drivers.
At checkpoints, GPD or ASO locks down a roadway and stops a certain percentage of traffic to 
check for DUIs.
In other cases, law enforcement 
officers disperse over a certain 
area to remind drivers not to drive drunk, and they pull over those driving erratically.
Ettel said when drivers see that 
uniformed officers are in the area, they are less likely to drink and 
drive.
“Catching a DUI is not our 
goal,” he said. “Our goal is to make 
people aware that they should not be drinking and driving.”Students risk suspensions
for drunken driving 
DUI , from page 1She said she reported the incident, as well as 
the assault by the male colleague in February 
2007, but UF did nothing about either incident.
In August of 2007, she filed an internal discrim-
ination complaint against UF. The investigation 
determined all her claims were unsubstantiated.  
She also filed a discrimination complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. According to the lawsuit, the office found reason to believe violations of federal civil rights laws had occurred.
The next day, Russell-Brown was placed on 
unpaid leave. She alleges this violated UF regula-tions and filed a grievance. She resigned on Dec. 31, 2007.
The lawsuit claims Russell-Brown’s perfor-
mance as a professor was exemplary, citing her promotion in 2004 and nomination as “Professor of the Year” in 2002 and 2003. 
In a letter sent to law students Monday, Jerry 
denied the allegations.
“At this time, I am at liberty to say that the al-
legations...are unfounded,” he wrote. “We will be responding vigorously to this complaint.” An al-most identical letter was sent to faculty.
Debra Amirin, director of communications for 
the law school, added the college is committed to diversity, with minorities making up over a quar-
ter of the 2008 class and 19 percent of the faculty.Lawsuit claims exemplary performance

Student senators decided to shell 
out about $5,500 during Tuesday 
night’s Senate meeting to four stu-dent organizations.
But while senators tried take care 
of business, tension from the upcom-ing Student Government elections seeped in and slowed progress. 
Controversy arose during the 
UF Paintball Team’s presentation to convince senators of the group’s need for funding. Independent Sen. Brandon White, 
who represents the Warrington Col-lege of Business Administration, ac-cused Orange and Blue Party Sen. Ben Dictor, who represents the Col-lege of Liberal Arts and Sciences, of campaigning while he spoke on be-half of the team’s monetary need.
White is running for Student 
Body treasurer with the Orange and 
Blue Party, while Dictor is running 
for Student Body president with the Progress Party.  “This is outra-geous,” Dictor said. “This senate is sleeping on the job, and this has nothing to do with campaigning. Wake up. Please give the gentleman who came here from the paintball committee respect that you didn’t give me.”
After tempers settled, UF senior 
Ross Marshman, the paintball team’s representative, tried to lighten up 
the atmosphere. 
“I hope this presentation is worth 
it since it brought about a lot of emo-
tion,” Marshman said. 
In the end, the majority of sena-
tors voted to give  $3,274 to the team so they could attend the national paintball championships. 
White, who is also the Budget 
and Appropriations chairman, cau-tioned senators against excessive awarding.
“I want us to keep in mind, as a 
Senate, that the money we are giv-ing out is supposed to benefit every-
one,” he said. “We’re not giving out 
money just because we have it.” 
UF graduate student Matt Martz 
also came by to say he will not pub-licly apologize for creating the Face-book group, “KICK OUT the Gator/Unite Party.” 
Martz was ordered yesterday to 
apologize by SG’s Elections Com-
mission, an act he said infringed 
upon his constitutional rights.
“It’s my political opinion,” he 
said, adding that he expects to be disqualified because of the act. 
Controversy arises over allocation of SG funding
Florida’s agricultural commodities, such as oranges. 
Sam Selikoff, a UF finance senior and teaching as-
sistant for a managerial economics course, does not see the bill in such a positive light.
Selikoff said it makes him nervous that a small 
group of government officials is making this big eco-nomic decision.
However, time and time again, he said, the coun-
try has shown that private industry and individuals are the best way to make up for the economic shocks 
the country experiences.
Ted Kury, the director of energy studies for the 
Public Utility Research Center at UF, said a national 
policy should not be dictating the actions of every state.
He said the government is attaching a lot of strings 
to the stimulus plan.
As of now, the plan is requiring the states to adapt 
a decoupling of utility companies’ revenues, which 
would cut the bond between sales and revenues.
This means that while utility companies receive a 
steady revenue via the plan, customers will not nec-
essarily get a lower bill.
The federal government is assuming this plan will 
work well for all states, he said, adding that this may not be the case.Plan could aid in

Mendelson, 25, is the college community 
organizer for the 1 in 8 Foundation, a nonprofit organization named for the number of women 
affected by breast cancer in the U.S.
Cancer is prevalent in Mendelson’s family, 
and his grandmother survived breast cancer 
because she was screened early, he said.
“I knew if I had time to do something, (rais-
ing awareness) would be it,” he said.
The couple began their trek in New York, 
drove to Washington, D.C., and then made their way to the Southeast. In the next four months, the Mendelsons plan to visit at least 50 college campuses.
According to 1 in 8 president and CEO Ken 
Vrana, 1 in 8 is different from most cancer or-ganizations because it focuses on prevention, 
not a cure.
“While the money is obviously important,” 
he said, “it doesn’t mean as much as (Mendel-
son) leaving a university and having even just one girl say, ‘You know what? I’m going to have a mammogram done next week.’”
While most 1 in 8 employees receive a com-
mission for the money they raise, Mendelson — who calls himself cancer’s butt-kicker — is 
working toward a grant that he says will fur-
ther his efforts to “fight Generation Y’s cancer epidemic.”
Vrana said that Mendelson’s tour has gar-
nered interest in the foundation from major media entities like CNN, and although he could not divulge details, he said President Barack Obama “is going to do something very special for the foundation.”Beginning about a week ago, Mendelson 
and his wife drove from state to state sleeping wherever they could find someone willing to house them — but so far, he said, hotel owners have donated rooms, including one at Gaines-ville’s Camellia Inn.
While Mendelson, a graduate student at 
the State University of New York at Albany, said the motive for adding Gainesville to the 
trip was his love for the Gator football team. He said that UF’s size creates a great op-portunity.
“I think we could really do some good for 
Gainesville if we get everyone together,” he 
said.
During their two days in Gainesville, the 
Mendelsons spoke to Mayor Pegeen Hanrah-
an about their mission, donated health drinks to a local homeless shelter and met with Ga-torStrong, a UF cancer awareness group.
Laura Teisch, president of GatorStrong, 
said that she hopes the meeting with Mendel-son will help publicize GatorStrong and its mission across the student body.
The Mendelsons also collect CDs and CD 
players to distribute at pediatric cancer cen-ters. They plan to make the first drop in Or-lando.
Mendelson wants to raise $5 million for the 
1 in 8 Foundation, but he set an initial goal of $8,000, a number he thinks is a realistic short-term target.
The money raised goes directly to hospitals 
and clinics for mammograms, said Mendel-son.
Although the man-and-wife duo doesn’t 
have time to linger anywhere for more than a day or two, Mendelson encourages students 
to continue to collect donations or contact him 
to set up a drive or discuss ideas.
This approachability is one thing Mendel-
son says he and his wife offer where a lot of organizations — especially those run by celeb-rities — fall short.
“We’re not MTV. We’re not VH1,” he said. 
“We’re just a husband and wife doing the best we can with what we’ve got.”

Snuggie comforts you with open arms
Today’s question: Would you buy 
a Snuggie?Tuesday’s question: Do you forgive A-Rod for his admitted steroid use? 36% YES64% NO
200 TOTAL VOTESRidin’ DirtyEven while boasting recession-proof returns, McDon-
ald’s can’t help but smile after receiving free advertis-
ing at the hands of a loyal employee. 
Especially when that plug comes while conversing with 
President Barack Obama.
Tuesday’s town hall meeting between Obama and the citi-
zens of Fort Myers offered a sobering account of the current economic crisis — at least until Julio Osegueda had the op-
portunity to speak his mind.
When Obama informed the audience he wanted to hear 
from a man for the final question, he called upon Osegueda, a college student and burger purveyor who was going crazy to 
catch Obama’s eye. Captivating both the audience and presi-
dent alike, Osegueda asked the president what he planned to 
do to assist individuals like himself, a McDonald’s employee, 
given the financial climate.
The Editorial Board thinks Osegueda is a downright awe-
some individual for his gregarious antics. His passion and enthusiasm helped lighten up an event dealing with one of 
most serious issues our country has ever faced. 
What we find especially hilarious is the fact that Osegue-
da turned to Facebook on Monday with hopes of unloading 
a spare ticket — not exactly the most legal way of turning a 
quick buck.
While Osegueda failed to find a buyer, we are happy to 
report he walked away from the town hall meeting with a new job offer.
Invited by the Fort Myers Miracle, a minor league base-
ball team, the aspiring disc-jockey-slash-broadcaster will have the opportunity to announce an upcoming game.
The pay? $25.
From marijuana grow 
houses to teachers wielding weapons, ab-
surdity runs rampant on the North Central Florida crime 
scene.
The latest incident of 
devious debauchery stems 
from a routine traffic stop after a police officer smelled pot emanating from a vehi-cle on Tuesday.
Expecting to discover 
rolling papers and a dime 
bag, we can safely assume 
the discovery of thousands of dollars worth of stolen goods left the officer nothing short of wide-eyed. 
According to a Gainesville 
Sun article, the driver and passenger currently being held may be the master-
minds behind a string of re-
cent robberies in the area.
Nothing short of a pawn 
shop on wheels, the vehicle contained a handgun, mul-tiple watches and assorted jewelry, not to mention a whole mess of credit cards and licenses.
Among the most out-
landish items in the treasure 
chest? A Cox Cable remote.
The Editorial Board won-
ders why the two men in the 
vehicle were driving around Gainesville with a stolen re-mote control. 
Maybe they enjoyed sit-
ting outside houses discreet-ly changing the channel on 
unsuspecting TV watchers.
With the click of a button, 
a seemingly innocent view-
ing of “The L Word” can quickly turn into the latest edition of “SportsCenter.”
Or perhaps they simply 
had the best interest of the now-remote-less person in 
mind.
Nothing like burning a 
few calories by getting off the 
couch to change the channel after a five-hour marathon of “Bromance.”Pick me!
Burger flipper makes 
super-sized appearance
Not many things are quite as impressive as the Snug-
gie — the blanket with sleeves that “won’t slip and slide like a regular blanket.”
After hearing of this wondrous item, my life was forever 
changed. Who would have thought that taking a robe, mak-ing it longer and wearing it backwards would be so inge-nious and so lucrative?
More than four million of these miracle items have been 
sold, liberating arms from the imprisoning confines of op-pressive blankets all over the country. At $19.95 a pair (plus shipping and handling,) this bastard child between a blan-
ket and a sweatshirt is one of the best-selling novelty items 
of the winter. 
For those with more expensive tastes, there is the Slanket 
at $44.99. For those who want to splurge even more, look 
no further. The Blankoat from Iceland-based designer Sruli 
Recht will set buyers back a whopping $350 — all for the 
Snuggie’s more avant-garde cousin. Made out of Icelandic 
wool, the pedigreed Blankoat makes the Snuggie look like a mutt.
Therein lies the charm of the Snuggie. The campy info-
mercial that plagues prime-time television is just so hideous that it is amazing. In a time of economic downturn, as the infomercial points out, people are turning down their ther-mostats and reaching for fleece alternatives. Praise be to the failing economy for giving us the chance to bring these blankets with sleeves into our homes.
There is even an LED light included for when the electric 
company cuts off your power.
The slow economy is also to thank for the mass exposure 
to items like the Snuggie and the superabsorbent Sham-Wow!, the German-created towel that will dry a sweater faster than Marty McFly’s self-drying jacket from the year 2015. Because of plummeting prices for airtime, the mar-keters of these kitschy products swooped in and have taken advertising spots that used to be reserved for more highbrow items.
The Snuggie has made many 
appearances in the morning news circuit, including NBC’s “Today Show,” in which the whole cast and crew donned Snuggies on-air. One would 
think that all of this fame would go to the Snuggie’s head. 
Quite the contrary, this fleece delight is as humble as ever. 
Wait, there’s an idea! Add a hood to the Snuggie!
It does not look like the Snuggie era is coming to an end 
any time soon, either. The infomercials have made it to You-
Tube and have spawned quite a few parodies, “The Cult 
of Snuggie” and “The WTF Blanket” included. Pop culture 
has embraced the Snuggie and made it more popular than its makers could have ever hoped for.
Yes, those wearing Snuggies may look absolutely ridicu-
lous, but they also look surprisingly happy. There is some-thing almost touching about a product that can promise you total comfort in a time when people are worried for their futures. Perhaps the Snuggie is selling more than just a blanket replacement.
And if you happen to tear your Snuggie, Billy Mays — an 
apparent long-time sufferer of the dreaded voice immodu-lation disorder — has the perfect answer in the machine-washable Mighty Mendit bonding agent.
Thank you, Billy Mays. Now we can keep our Snuggies 
forever!Naudia Jawad is a journalism graduate student. Her column appears on Wednesday.

Alligator guilty of self-righteous agenda
I notice the Alligator tends to be pretty 
opinionated, which is good — it’s more in-
teresting that way. However, the newspaper is also pretty ignorant, which is something I personally dislike.
Let me try to explain the difference between 
the two: I have strong opinions on quite a few subjects (for example, I don’t like the idea of homosexuality). 
However, I’d like to think that I’m not ig-
norant enough to claim my opinions are some sort of absolute truth, and I can change them based on new ideas.
Many Alligator articles, on the other hand, 
are worded as if the writer had some sort of a divine being clearly explain to him what’s good and bad and is now compelled to pass that knowledge on to the readers.

Ad sends unhealthy message to women
Dear Gainesville Health and Fitness Cen-
ters,
In facing my anorexia I have come to real-
ize how distorted this world is. 
These gross depictions of what is normal 
and right have caused eating disorders and body dissatisfaction to permeate today’s soci-eties. It is no longer the stereotype of teen girls starving themselves. It is young, it is old. It is women, it is men. 
It is restricting, it is binging.
The matter of what, when and in whom 
symptoms manifest is not the problem. What results is intensive self-loathing and a society obsessed with perfection that calls for the ig-norance of health and happiness. 
My membership to your gym allowed for 
my sixty-pound weight loss. I was finally the girl I saw in advertisements. Yet most disturb-
ing was the fact that I was still not happy. 
As my treatment for anorexia progresses, I 
have come to find that unrealistic expectations 
and unhealthy emotions and behaviors occur at any size.
Therefore, I was disgusted when I saw an 
ad of yours displaying a girl with absolutely no ass in a white bikini. 
The slogan “To get here…start here” sick-
ened me. 
The message you are relaying is the very 
essence of eating disorders and distorted im-ages that are perpetuated by the naive general public.
This needs to stop. I am begging you to pull this ad and others 
that emphasize body shape over the impor-
tance of health. 
The very fact that “health” is in your com-
pany name is a lie if you continue to support 
unhealthy body types and images in order to sell more memberships.

Column
As I write, the Senate has passed the economic stimu-
lus package, sending it back to the House for the final stage of negotiations. It’s a wonder they achieved any 
deal, however fragile it was, considering the attempts by Con-gressional Republicans to dynamite the process. 
Three Republican senators supported the stimulus pack-
age, which is downright shameful. Of 219 Republicans on Capitol Hill, only three had the gumption to buck party lead-
ers and broker a compromise with the Democrats. 
The rest justify their attempted ob-
structionism by claiming that the stimu-lus is not a “bipartisan solution,” which is patently false. While final numbers 
may vary, about 58 percent of the bill 
is government spending, the preferred recovery policy of Democrats. The oth-er 42 percent is comprised of tax cuts, the preferred stimulus measure of Re-publicans. Despite the fact that many 
Democrats argued against the tax cuts, they were included to attract votes from across the aisle. 
They attracted three. Hallelujah for bipartisanship!
By contrast, 40 Democrats supported President Bush’s eco-
nomic growth package in 2001, a package composed almost 
entirely of tax cuts. In other words, Democrats were told to stuff it, and they still managed to be more cooperative than Republicans are being. 
If they had their own ideas to offer, the Republicans’ 
almost-unanimous negation wouldn’t be so offensive. Yet when pressed for solutions of their own, these Republicans have only one answer: tax cuts. If this answer sounds famil-
iar, it should. For eight long years, tax cuts were the solution 
thrown at every economic problem, every time. They were the president’s bread-for-the-masses — a popular bit of slogan-eering that stimulated Bush’s election results more than they did the American economy. So we’ve tried the tax-cuts-cure-all approach. In case you forgot, we are currently staring into the economic abyss. Call it a hunch, but something tells me Bush economics weren’t quite a rousing success. 
I’m not arguing that tax cuts can’t help the economy — I’m 
arguing that they’re occasionally useful but wholly inade-quate. If they are targeted to soften the impact of this recession on those who need help most, I can understand their inclu-sion. But they simply won’t solve the problems of an economy that has shed almost a million jobs since the year began. They are relief, not recovery. Anyone who tells you otherwise is a liar, pure and simple. 
I have a message for Republicans on Capitol Hill: This is 
what life feels like when you’re in the minority (and a small 
minority, at that). You don’t get to construct policy. You get 
to watch policy being constructed and hope it doesn’t offend your delicate sensitivities. Democrats watched for years as President Bush ran amok with the help of a Republican Con-gress. They feel your pain, believe me. 
It may seem unfortunate, but elections have consequences, 
and this is one of them: If you lose, you lose. You don’t get to continue acting like you won. The country made a big, collec-tive decision last November, and we decided we preferred the 
ideas of the guy with the “D” next to his name. 
Typically, this is the point at which those ideas become re-
ality. Deal with it.

“Field of Dreams” will always be one of my fa-
vorite movies, but I’m not sure how anyone can be a fan of professional baseball in this 
day and age.
You know what Babe Ruth used to do before a game? 
Drink a beer and eat a goddamn hot dog.
That would be unheard of today. Athletes have their 
diets planned for them and their bodies sculpted by per-sonal trainers. And, for players today, a more common fortification than beer is human growth hormones. 
Where’s the humanity?Athletes are scouted from regions far removed from 
the area they eventually represent, and millions of dol-lars are poured into the cultivation of their skills.
Now Alex Rodriguez, widely regarded as the most 
talented player in baseball, has joined the ranks of Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens as outed steroid users. 
Never again will there be a moment in baseball like 
The Shot Heard Around the World, a moment in which a genuine home run, a genuine feat of athleticism and grace (a line-drive hit in the Polo Grounds, about 500 feet) changes the course of history or — even partially — defines an era. The professional athlete is not a hero 
but a commodity. Sometimes, in this era of fervent drug abuse, he is an embarrassment. 
Home run records seem to 
be broken, or almost broken, 
every season now. How could they not be, with the way the 
league facilitates it? Ratings are everything. Baseball doesn’t have the pull it used to, so what better way to get people to watch than to pull in the fences and allow for some more action? 
There’s a military-industrial complex in baseball 
now. Franchises pour increasing amounts of funds into building the best teams they can. Where’s the sport of it? It’s all about resources. 
How can someone truly love a team? Do the players 
represent them? Are their accomplishments the result of drugs or their own skill? Are they playing for the love of the game or for an exorbitant salary? 
Put simply, would you rather have a hero than can 
hit a homer with a few beers in him, or would you rather have one that can only do it after devouring a bunch of testosterone?
Everyone in the latter category should be pushed into 
a corn vortex and never heard from again. Bottom line.

As the holiday that emphasizes love and 
intimacy approaches, students will have the 
chance to get checked for STDs.                          
For the first time, UF will host free STD 
screenings at the Student Health Care Center on campus from 5 to 8 p.m. today.
Dr. Shirley Haberman, director of UF’s 
GatorWell Health Promotion Services, col-laborated with the Alachua County Health Department to hold the “Play it Safe: Get Tested” event on campus.
Haberman said she organized the event 
after learning from a colleague at the ACHD that chlamydia was on the rise in Alachua County.
“(STD rates are) increasing, and we’re 
looking for ways to impact that,” Haberman said.
The number of cases of chlamydia in Ala-
chua has more than doubled since 1996, ris-ing from 514 to 1,263 in 2005, according to the Florida Department of Health.
The Student Health Care Center will be 
screening for chlamydia, HIV, syphilis and gonorrhea. Gardasil, the HPV vaccine that 
consists of three injections over a six month period, will be of-fered for $165 a shot.
According to the SHCC, STD 
screenings normally cost about 
$75, whereas HIV testing runs about $15. But with ACHD footing the bill, money won’t be an issue.“It will give peace of mind to students, be-
ing able to get the tests and not worry,” Hab-erman said. 
Samantha Evans, UF health promotion 
specialist, said there were about 1,520 STD tests given at the SHCC from Jan. 1 to June 30 in 2008.
The number of students being tested is in-
creasing, she said.
“Students need to be realistic, that if 
they’re sexually active, they may have an STD,” she said. SHCC offers first free STD screening on UF campus

I got at your place a couple of hours early and Trig was there. He insisted that I have a beer. I didn’t want to. But he practically made me! I TOLD you what drinking does to me, I can’t control myself. Anyway before I knew it, he was kiss-ing me and running his fingers through my hair and so forth. I almost gave in completely, but then jumped up, straightened my clothes and went home. I feel so guilty, I know you won’t forgive me even though I do love you.

UF guard Nick Calathes shoots in front of Kentucky’s Ramon Harris during the first 
half of the Gators’ 68-65 loss against the Wildcats in Lexington, Ky., on Tuesday night.
By MIKE DiFERDINANDO
Alligator Staff Writer
mdiferdinando@alligator.org
LEXINGTON, Ky. — Nick Calathes did 
all he could Tuesday night.
It wasn’t enough.
Despite scoring a career-high 33 points, 
Calathes and UF (19-5, 6-3 Southeastern 
Conference) fell 68-65 to Kentucky (17-7, 6-3 
SEC) in Rupp Arena.
Kentucky’s Jodie Meeks dazzled the Lex-
ington crowd with 23 points and the game-winning 3-pointer with 4.7 seconds to play.
“He just made 
some great shots,” UF center Alex Tyus said. “Some-
times there’s 
nothing you can do about that.”
With the Gators 
up 64-63 and 1:17 left on the clock, forward Dan Werner missed 
a three that led to Meeks getting fouled in 
transition.
He made both foul shots and put the 
Wildcats up 65-64.
Werner was fouled on the next posses-
sion and tied the game at 65 after making 
one of his two shots from the line.
With 4.7 seconds left, Meeks hit a three 
from the left shoulder of the court while be-ing closely guarded by Calathes to put Ken-tucky on top 68-65.
Calathes was fouled taking a despera-
tion three with 0.6 seconds left but missed all three shots.
“I just missed it,” Calathes said. “I feel 
like I let the team down.”
Tyus had confidence that his point guard 
would hit the free throws.Late 3 spells 
loss for UFWith 0.6 seconds left, Nick Calathes 
finally became like the rest of his 
teammates.
He morphed into an average college bas-
ketball player. 
Calathes won’t forgive himself for missing 
the game’s final free throws that more than 
likely would have sent the game into overtime — ever. 
That’s why he has 
become one of the best 
players in the nation, 
as a 33-point and sev-en-rebound showing proves. 
When the rest of 
your team shoots 35 percent and only hits 12 
field goals, however, it makes those 33 points not enough. And you can’t blame Calathes for 
that.
He was the only player to show up for 
the Gators in their 68-65 loss at Kentucky on 
Tuesday night. 
Alex Tyus made a cameo every now and 
again, but Calathes was the only UF player who stood out. 
Tuesday night’s show featured Walter 
Hodge missing a wide-open three while Dan 
Werner tossed the ball right into the hands of 
Kentucky defenders. 
And most of Tyus’ scores come off of Cal-
athes’ ability to see the floor.
This is why UF is still stuck in the mud of 
mediocrity. 
Without Calathes leading them, the Gators 
are one of the worst major-conference teams in the country. 
With him, they’ll be one of 65 teams get-
ting to play for a national championship. The Gators have other players who are capable of scoring, but they can’t be counted on for ev-Calathes only one

tributes, then the No. 9 Gators (22-2, 8-1 
Southeastern Conference) would not have anywhere near the success they have had so far this season.
UF is undersized and outmatched against almost every team it faces, and the same was true, by far, against Tennessee on Sunday.
The Volunteers stood taller than the 
Gators at every position, and all five of their starters were 6 feet or taller.
To put it in perspective, UF forward 
Marshae Dotson is only 5-foot-11, and she’s the tallest player in the Gators’ starting lineup.
So how does this team win games? How 
do they match up with other teams when they’re overmatched on paper 90 percent of the time?
For UF coach Amanda Butler, the an-
swer is simple.
“When it comes down to it, it is effort, it 
is heart, it is desire,” Butler said.
That is probably the best explanation, 
considering four of the Gators’ starters this season were on the 9-22 squad from two years ago.
Want, passion, motivation — Butler 
could probably throw those words in there as well to describe and explain the reason for her team’s success.
“When talent is fairly equal, it comes 
down to who wants it more,” Butler said. “That’s what we see from this team over and over and over again, is they’re not go-ing to be denied.
“When it comes down to it, I want the 
ball more than you do. I’m going to beat you to the spot. I’m going to dive and get on the floor before you do. It’s those little Gators winning with attributes other than heightSEE HOOPS, PAGE 16

Tuesday was a step in the right di-
rection for the UF women’s golf team 
but also a step back.
The Gators shot 25 over par 
Tuesday in the second round of the Northrop Grumman Regional Chal-lenge in Palos Verdes, Calif., a 16-shot improvement from Monday’s first round.
Despite that turnaround, the Ga-
tors fell even further back on the leaderboard and are now 35 strokes 
behind first-place Arizona State in 
seventh place.
The one constant was sophomore 
Jessica Yadloczky, who matched her first-round score of 4 over par. She moved up on the individual leader-board, tying for fifth place.
“I’ve really stuck with my goals 
for the week,” Yadloczky said. “I’ve 
been concentrating not on my physi-
cal game but on my goals I set out be-fore I came to the tournament.”
The weather was much better than 
in round one, helping the other three golfers achieve lower scores.
Freshman Andrea Watts made 
the biggest jump from the first round. Her second-round score of 5 over par 
translated into a six-shot improve-ment from Monday’s score. She fin-ished the day strong with her only 
birdie coming on the last hole.
Lauren Uzelatz and Evan Jensen 
also had much better rounds on Tues-day. Uzelatz shot a second-round score of 10 over par while Jensen shot 6 over par. Both golfers made a five-
shot improve-ment.
T h e s e 
lower scores were in most part due to the clearer weath-er, Watts said.
“A lot of it 
had to do with the weather, a lot of it also had to do with how upset we 
were with our performance yester-
day,” she said. “We were fired up, ready to improve, and ready to play better today.”
The team will not rest after Tues-
day’s better performances.
“I think it’s motivating,” Watts 
said. “We need to work harder and move forward, just try to improve for 
tomorrow.”
The Gators will go with the same 
lineup for the tournament’s final 
round Wednesday as they used Tuesday.

Sometimes a loss is just a loss — nothing more, nothing 
less.
Following the No. 2 Gators’ (2-1) 1-0 loss to Baylor on 
Sunday, UF coach Tim Walton said he doesn’t want to let 
the defeat — only the team’s second loss at home since April 27, 2007 — affect the way he coaches his players at the plate throughout the rest of the season. That starts with UF’s game 
today at Jacksonville (1-4) at 5 p.m.
“There wasn’t any difference (in the way we played) be-
tween the wins and the losses. We just weren’t able to get any 
hits or get anything going,” Walton said. “We’re not going to change anything. You saw what we can do on Saturday in 
front of 1,572 people. We can really hit.”
The Gators proved they have the talent to win games with 
their hitting Saturday by scoring 8 runs and knocking three 
balls out of the park, but talent alone isn’t always enough to 
come out on top in a close game against a dominant pitcher.
“We’re going to have to learn how to win games like that,” 
Walton said. “The difference between this year and last year 
is that we found a way to win those kind of games last year, but arguably, in our five losses, it was exactly like that.”
In their 70-5 2008 season, the Gators’ losses were by a com-
bined 5 runs. One key difference, however, was that UF’s first loss last season came after 19 straight wins. The Gators fell 2-1 after 10 innings at Long Beach State on Feb. 27. 
After an impressive offensive performance Saturday, UF 
came up empty at the plate in Game 3 against Baylor. Center-fielder Kim Waleszonia attributed the lack of offensive pro-duction to the Gators’ failure to make the necessary changes after their first at-bats.
“We just didn’t make the adjustments we needed to make,” 
Waleszonia said after Sunday’s game. “By the third round, we should have been taking better hacks and not doing the same things we did Friday night or in our first at-bats today. We 
just didn’t make the adjustments fast enough — or at all.”
Walton noted the team’s need for improvement at short-stop, where sophomore Megan Bush started all three games over the weekend but made a critical error in the fifth inning 
of Game 3. Baylor capitalized on Bush’s mistake and an un-characteristic error by pitcher Stacey Nelson to score the only run of the game.
Senior Le-Net Franklin, who only took the field during the 
weekend’s games as a pinch runner, will see more time on the field as the season progresses, Walton added.WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY  11, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 15

UF SOFTBAllGators look to rebound in Jacksonville after loss

Out of the frying pan that is Baton Rouge, 
La., and into the fire that is East Lansing, 
Mich.
The No. 9 UF gymnastics team will take to 
the road for its second consecutive away meet to take on Michigan State in a Valentine’s Day meet. 
The Gators (3-2, 2-2 Southeastern Confer-
ence) are 0-2 on the road this season after los-ing their latest bout at LSU last Friday.
Even though UF coach Rhonda Faehn said 
the performance against the Tigers was better than the previous two meets, it wasn’t good enough for the win. Faehn added that the per-formance showed how far away the team was from tapping its true potential.
A large part of the blame falls on injuries, 
which have prevented UF from putting out a consistent, 24-for-24 lineup this season.
Amanda Castillo has nursed bursitis in her 
ankle the whole season and has been scattered around on events since the first meet. After 
performing on balance beam and uneven bars 
for the first four meets, she was taken off beam against the Tigers, but was still plugged into the floor lineup for the first time this season. 
She was on the vault lineup the first meet 
and hasn’t appeared on vault since, but Faehn said Castillo has started training on vault this week and may be in the lineup — unveiling yet another lineup change.
Freshman Nicole Ellis had a hip problem 
take her out against Arkansas on Jan. 23 after she had performed in the first two meets. She returned against Kentucky on vault Jan. 30, scoring a 9.775. Her hip appeared to be better, and Ellis improved to a 9.85 on vault against LSU.
Six weeks into the season, it appears Faehn 
may finally be getting close to a final lineup.
She said the team was set on bars and vault 
is close, but depends on Castillo’s progress. 
Castillo should also be in the floor lineup 
again, but where she competes in the lineup is unsure and may be meet-to-meet.
The most problematic event for the team 
this season, beam, may finally be tamed.
“On beam, I truly feel the lineup we’re go-
ing to have this weekend at Michigan State will be our set lineup,” Faehn said. “We’re hoping 
it will be there, and we’re not deviating from it, no matter 
what.”
Beam has been the team’s 
weakest event this season after it was the Gators’ best 
event in the first meet. The 
team is ranked 22nd in the country on beam coming into this meet.
As if the team needed anything else going 
against it, they will have to leave the confines of Gainesville for a second straight meet.
“I would say that right now (the road 
meet’s) not any different than any of our home 
meets,” Faehn said. “We haven’t performed 
the way we needed to at either place.”
If the Gators want some Valentine’s Day 
love in East Lansing, they will need to improve upon this season’s performances and pull bits and pieces of highlights from every meet, cul-minating with the team shedding its tentative-ness.
“This isn’t the place we want to be right 
now, and it’s not where we anticipated being this far down in our season,” Faehn said. “We know we have a hill we have to climb.”Gymnasts far from potential

UF improves on Day 2
Golf16, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 11, 2009
“I thought he was going to 
make those shots,” Tyus said. “I 
was ready to go to overtime.” 
In the first half, UF forward 
Chandler Parsons was sent to the 
bench after picking up two fouls 
with 12:51 to play. 
With Parsons out of the game, it was up to Calathes to shoulder the 
offensive burden.
The sophomore rose to the chal-
lenge, scoring 18 in the first half.
After leading early on, the 
Gators allowed the Wildcats to go 
on an 18-4 run that gave them a 24-18 lead with 4:44 left in the first half.
With less than a minute to play 
in the opening period, Calathes knocked down a three that cut the Kentucky lead to 2. He was fouled on the next possession and made both foul shots to tie the game at 
30 heading into halftime.The Gators opened the second 
half strong, jumping out to a 36-34 
lead when senior Walter Hodge was given a flagrant technical foul and ejected from the game. He stepped on the right arm of Ken-tucky’s Perry Stevenson.
“I don’t think (Hodge) kicked 
him,” Calathes said. “He’s not the kind of player who would do 
that.”The Wildcats fought their way 
to a 50-47 lead with 9:06 to play 
in the game when big man Pat-rick Patterson went down with an ankle injury after fouling UF freshman Kenny Kadji. Patterson finished with 7 points and eight rebounds.
With Patterson out of the game 
things, opened up for Tyus, who 
scored 14 points.Calathes’ missed free throws prevent game from going to overtime
things that are making the difference.”
Those are the things Butler did so well in her career as 
a player at UF, and she has instilled the same qualities in 
her team now.
Butler said she even has to shorten drills in practice be-
cause the players get too physical or intense.
Tennessee coach Pat Summitt noticed the fight and the 
energy the Gators brought on Sunday, something she said her own team didn’t do at times.“The thing that impressed me so much watching them 
on tape is how hard they play, how passionate they are,” 
Summitt said. “Clearly, they’re not a team that’s taking possessions off.”
Summitt said UF’s leader, Sha Brooks, 
knows how to motivate her team, but Summitt questioned whether doing so was necessary.
“I don’t know if she has to do very 
much,” Summitt said. “They’re pretty 
motivated to begin with.”So to recap, the words used that best explain the Gators’ 
success go as follows: effort, heart, desire, want, passion and motivation.
“We aren’t taller than anybody,” Butler said. “I don’t 
feel like we have this huge talent advantage any night, but I’ve got so much confidence in how they play together, and they’ve got so much confidence in one another. 
“And we know that if the outcome of the game is going 
to be determined by effort, it’s going to be determined by 
pursuit of the ball and those sort of things, then we’re go-
ing to be in good shape.”Tennessee coach Summitt impressed by UF’s passion, energy, effortery game, as this loss shows. 
There is nobody to grab the tough re-
bound.
There is nobody to guard the oppo-
nent’s best player, regardless of position. 
There is nobody who can be counted on to find the open teammate when the defense 
breaks down.
Calathes is not that big or strong, but 
he’s tough enough to wrestle the ball from players bigger and stronger than he 
is. He’s not exceptionally athletic, but he leaves players far more physically gifted than he is behind him and wondering what just happened. 
He is the only reason the Gators have 
any chance of advancing past the opening round in the NCAA Tournament this sea-son.
When it looked like this UF-Kentucky 
rivalry was beginning to simmer and go on the back burner, Calathes played with a passion that made you think he was put-ting on North Carolina blue and playing at Duke’s Cameron Indoor Stadium. 
He was a Boston Red Sox hitter going 
up in the bottom of the ninth, down by one run with two outs against the New York 
Yankees. 
He was a star Miami Dolphins lineback-
er looking to dismember the New York 
Jets’ quarterback.
His teammates, on the other hand, 
played like they were the Los Angeles Clippers hiding behind the shadows of the Lakers, hoping to not even be noticed. Or maybe they were the Cincinnati Ben-
gals, just hoping to be average.
It’s too bad the lasting memory of this 
game for UF fans will be Calathes shaking his head at the free-throw line. 
They should be reminiscing about that 
Chandler Parsons miss or one of Werner’s many clankers, or maybe even Hodge’s ejection.
Calathes was shaking his head after 
those misses, but it was those other guys who will be keeping their heads down all the way back to Gainesville.HOOPS , from page 14
