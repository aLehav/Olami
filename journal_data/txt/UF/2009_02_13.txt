When thinking of a city hot spot, the li-
brary isn’t usually what comes to mind. 
But in the face of a sunken economy 
and high  unemployment, people line 
up to take advantage of what they’ve al-
ready paid for with their tax dollars. 
According to Angela Harris, market-
ing and public relations manager for the 
Alachua County li-
brary district, the past year has ushered in a new high for library 
usage.
The county’s 10 public libraries have 
become more popular as penny pinchers 
seek free forms of entertainment. Com-
puter use has also soared as the unem-ployed line up to job search on library computers, Harris said.
“With a lot of people out of work,” she 
said, “they’re coming in to fill out online job applications.” 
The number of people who use the li-
brary’s computers to access the Internet rose so much in the past year that the library began enforcing time limits on computers, Harris said. In the past, users stayed as long as they needed.
According to an ACLD statistical re-
port, about 10,000 more people have visited the library this fiscal year, which

� DEBATES TO BE HELD NEXT WEEK.

The week before Student Government 
elections, candidates running on the executive 
ticket will have the chance to prove their cre-dentials in a series of public debates. The events will be held in different ven-
ues starting Sunday and continuing through Thursday
Each will be hosted by a student organi-
zation, including the Freshman Leadership 
Council, Hispanic Student Association and 
UF’s College Republicans, which will co-host three debates with the Independent Florida Alligator. 
Meant to inform and familiarize students with the candidates, Progress Party presiden-tial candidate Ben Dictor said debates offer a chance for different ideas to be heard.
“It gives us the opportunity for students to 
hear where we differ on the issues,” he said. 
On Sunday, the FLC will hold its fourth an-
nual SG debate in the Reitz Union Grand Ball-room at 7:30 p.m. 
All four political parties — the Keg Party, 
the Orange and Blue Party, the Progress Party and the Unite Party — will be represented, ac-cording to Matthew Cannella, co-director of the debate. 
“Questions are focused on a variety of 
things, everything from their platform to the 
UF budget and current economic situation,” 
Cannella said, adding questions were collect-ed from students around campus. Organizations host debates for SG elections

President Abraham Lincoln was 
spotted celebrating his 200th birthday on campus yesterday in Turlington Plaza.
This 16th U.S. President recit-
ed quotes and read aloud, pausing to argue with Brother Micah, who was also preaching in the plaza.  
Lincoln, better known as UF alumnus Lew Welge, said this is his fourth or fifth year coming out for the re-enactment.
Wearing an old-fashioned black suit, 
Welge, 53, sported the iconic top hat and beard. He said his costume was de-
signed by a woman in St. Augustine.
Standing 6 feet 8 inches tall, Welge’s 
appearance caused people passing by to 
do a double take.
“My first thought was it’s interesting 
that there was a guy in a costume,” said UF sophomore Tim Johnson. “But he’s more than that; he’s very philosophi-cal.”
Welge spoke eloquently about his 
own ideas and quoted Lincoln occasion-ally.
“He’s an icon, but let’s avoid idola-
try,” he said. “I’m a re-enacter because I want people to appreciate him for his nuance, like our current president.”
He said he first got the idea to dress 
up as Lincoln while working at Kirby-Smith Middle School in Jacksonville, Fla. Welge said he would hand out cop-ies of the Gettysburg Address and read 
it to the students. 
School visits and presentations are 
not uncommon for the impersonator.
Part of Thursday was spent visiting 
a local school. Welge said the root word 
of education is "educe," which means to draw out.
“The best teachers draw out innate Lincoln impersonator visits campus Economy

Same-sex couples protest nationwide marriage bans
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Same-sex couples seeking 
to wed showed up at marriage license counters nationwide 
Thursday to highlight a right they don’t have in 48 states.
In San Francisco, where same-sex marriage was legal for 
nearly five months last year before California voters approved a ban, many couples who came to City Hall had already tied the knot but wanted to express their gratitude and to show they’re still part of the fight.
“All of our marriages are under the cloud of Proposition 8,” 
said Stuart Gaffney, 45, referring to California’s ballot initiative banning gay marriage. “Equality is an unfinished business in California.”

Haleigh was last seen Monday

Nearby, a team of about 30 
police officers and sheriff’s depu-ties walked shoulder-to-shoulder through the thick underbrush and palmettos. Each carried a machete to clear the brush. At times, they would stop and use a shovel to check when they found fresh dirt.
Haleigh was reported missing 
when her father returned home 
from work early Tuesday. His girl-
friend told a local newspaper she had been sleeping next to Haleigh when she woke up and discovered the child was gone.

Although UF administrators and 
Student Government big shots are 
usually concerned with budget cuts and solving problems. Come Satur-day, love will be the only thing on their 
minds.
“It’s a chance to recognize what a 
relationship means,” said Paige Cran-
dall, interim Dean of Students, adding that is her favorite part of Valentine’s Day. 
Crandall said a more traditional ap-
proach, such as flowers and a nice din-ner, is the way to win over her heart. 
While some look forward to spread-
ing the love, Valentine’s Day can also put the pressure on relationships and bring disheartening feelings, especially to men.  “I’m not a very big Valentine’s Day 
guy,” said Student Body President Kevin Reilly. “There’s a lot of unneces-sary pressure.” 
Still, Reilly said he is looking for-
ward to planning a homemade dinner and movie-watching on Saturday night 
with his girlfriend, an SG senator, who he has been dating since fall. 
Paul Drayton, Student 
Body treasurer, shares 
the same feelings as Reilly. 
“It forces you to spend extra mon-
ey,” he said, adding the holiday loses the good intentions when it becomes too materialistic. 
This year, Drayton’s plans include 
a trip home to spend the holiday with 
his mom.
“Since I’m a single man, she’s going 
to be my valentine this year,” he said.4, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 13, 2009

Students spoke, and the Department 
of Housing and Residence Education lis-
tened. 
Wireless will be installed in lobbies, 
hallways, lounges, laundry rooms and commons but not in dorm rooms because there is a local network connection.
Representatives from Student Gov-
ernment and Mayors’ Council, which represents residents of Family and Single 
Graduate Housing, presented the idea 
because of a demand by on-campus stu-dents.
“I think people are beginning to ex-
pect wireless wherever they go,” said Sharon Blansett, assistant director of housing for marketing, public relations and research.
The project will be completed in three 
phases over three years, Blansett said.
Phase one, which should be completed 
this month, includes Hume Hall, Beaty 
Towers, Jennings Hall, the Broward Area 
and the Yulee Area.
Phase two is set for next year and will 
include Tolbert Area, Graham Area and the Keys Residential Complex.
Phase three will be completed in 2010 
or 2011 and will include the Springs and Lakeside residential complexes and Mur-phree area.
Azfar Mian, director of housing for 
administrative services, said the cost for phase one is about $400,000. 
The price of phases two and three is 
still being researched. Blansett said be-cause the department does not receive 
funds from the state or school, its budget 
primarily comes from students’ rent.UF project brings wireless

Those missing an ex on Valentine’s Day 
should remember that the source of their pain 
might not be love, but dopamine. 
When a person is rejected, his or her brain 
releases dopamine, which can cause obsessive thinking and an intense emotional craving to-ward the rejector, according to a study.
UF freshman Kevin Olivier said he knows 
these feelings all too well.
Olivier said that although his girlfriend 
broke up with him four months ago, he still deals with these feelings.
“At first you start to think about what was 
wrong with you,” he said. “But then you want them back more than you think you will.”
After the breakup, Olivier said he thought 
about his ex and looked at her Facebook of-ten. 
Helen Fisher, who wrote several books on 
the topic, explains that rejected people feel abandonment rage toward their rejecting part-ner.
“Men and women can be furious at a re-
jecting partner, while still being very much in love with him or her,” Fisher writes.
While being dumped does take a biologi-
cal toll, it also has psychological and physical consequences.
“When you are rejected and emotionally 
hurt, the part of the brain that causes physi-cal pain may light up also,” said Ilan Shrira, a visiting UF psychology professor.
Shrira said people who are rejected often 
experience symptoms of acute depression that  last one to two weeks.
During this period, the rejected person may 
not be able to think rationally. 
Shrira said that romantically rejected peo-
ple lose their motivation and often need ad-vice on how to get their lives back on track.
UF senior Jessica Funk said after her boy-
friend broke up with her, she went through a phase where she felt bad about herself. 
“It was more me obsessing about what was 
wrong with me that he didn’t like, than me ob-sessing about him,” Funk said. Brain blamed for blues

About 90 people packed into 
Pugh Hall on Thursday night to 
hear three former U.S. ambassa-dors speak on America’s foreign policies and what changes Presi-
dent Barack Obama’s adminis-
tration might bring.
The speakers came to UF as 
part of the Bob Graham Center for Public Service’s 2009 Presi-dential Lecture Series, “Transi-tion to Power.”
Ray Mabus, former ambassa-
dor to Saudi Arabia and former 
governor of Mississippi; Doug-
las McElhaney, former ambassa-dor to Bosnia and Herzegovina; and Frank McNeil, former am-bassador to Costa Rica, all spoke at the lecture.
The event was the first part 
of a three-part series that will bring prominent politicians and 
experts to UF to speak this se-
mester.
Paul D’Anieri, dean of the 
College of Liberal Arts and Sci-ences, moderated the event and introduced the speakers.
Over the course of about 45 
minutes, the former ambassa-dors casually replied to ques-
tions asked by D’Anieri.“If we don’t fix the economy, 
the rest doesn’t matter,” said 
McNeil, who graduated from UF in 1954.
The speakers agreed on most 
of the issues that were covered, 
even cracking jokes at times.
During a question-and-
answer session, some students 
asked about the 
role of the U.S. in international law and the conflict be-
tween Palestine and Israel.
“It was a very useful dialogue 
on international diplomacy,” said Logan Perel, a UF political science sophomore. “They spoke 
about relative and current is-
sues.” 
UF paid for travel and lodg-
ing for the guests, said Mike 
Bowen, assistant director of the Graham Center.
Former  Sen. Bob Graham, 
who invited the speakers, said bringing international speak-ers like these allows students to become connected to the outside world.
“I believe that student life 
shouldn’t be lived inside the walls of the university,” he said. 
“Students need to be exposed to 
real-world people and events.”FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 13, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 5

Tavis Smiley urged UF stu-
dents to find their calling during 
his speech Thursday night. 
Besides the importance of 
leadership, Smiley also spoke 
about the meaning of Black His-tory Month and Barack Obama’s 
presidency.
“We celebrate black history 
today because somebody did 
something yesterday, and if we don’t do something today, there 
is no black history to celebrate tomorrow,” he said. 
UF is not just preparing stu-
dents to find jobs but to pursue 
leadership. The heart of leader-ship is love and service for other people, he said. 
More than 300 people attend-
ed his speech at the Phillips Cen-ter for Performing Arts.
Accent Speaker’s Bureau 
helped collaborate Smiley’s atten-dance with Black History Month. UF paid about  $40,000 to bring Smiley, who hosts a late night TV talk show on PBS and “The Tavis Smiley Show” on NPR. 
In his speech, Smiley said black leaders and not black peo-ple are the reason Black History Month is celebrated today. 
In disagreement with the sug-
gestion that Black History Month should no longer be celebrated since Obama has become presi-dent, Smiley emphasized black history is essential to American history. 
“If there was no Frederick 
Douglas, then there was no Abra-ham Lincoln,” he said. 
He challenged UF students 
to think where their football and basketball championship teams would be without their black players. He encouraged them to think what music in America would be like without black art-ists. 
Still, Smiley said it was impor-
tant that students hold Obama accountable.
He said getting Obama elect-
ed was the easy part to building a racially equal country. The real challenge is for Americans to push the president to do the right thing during his term.  
“The minute you start gov-
erning, you start disappointing,” Smiley said. “We got to push him into his greatness. We can’t aban-don our post now.” 
He pointed to shortcomings, 
such as Obama’s failure to ap-point a leader of the Department of Commerce in the midst of an economic crisis.Smiley discusses black historyU.S. ambassadors

Alligator to host SG debates next week
I’ve got one reason why you should care about Stu-
dent Government elections, and it’s worth $13 mil-lion.
The activities and service fee you pay (about $8 for 
12 credit hours if you enrolled fall 2008) makes up Stu-dent Government’s $13 million budget, which is divided among Rec Sports, the Reitz Union and student organi-
zations. 
And guess who decides how to divvy it up? 
That’s right: The student representatives you vote (or 
don’t vote) for.
By getting informed and voting, you’re choosing the 
leaders who decide how to spend that money. 
But with party supporters following you to your 
classes and tucking glossy fliers into your backpacks, figuring out who represents your interests can be dif-
ficult.
Well, we’re going to help you out a little.
The Alligator, in partnership with College Republi-
cans, will be conducting three executive debates Mon-day to Wednesday at 1 p.m. on Turlington Plaza.
You’ll hear from candidates running for all three ex-
ecutive positions. And if you can’t make it, head on over to alligator.org/sg2009, where we’ll be live-streaming video of the debates.
It’s time to get your questions answered.We’ve even taken extra precautions to make sure 
these candidates are getting a fair shake. 
Originally we invited College Republicans and Col-
lege Democrats to organize and host it with us to keep us 
in check, but unfortunately, College Democrats respect-
fully declined. 
It turns out their president is Mark McShera, who is running for Student Body president with the Orange and Blue Party. 
We understood their deci-
sion but still proceeded with 
College Republicans.
Each debate should last about one hour, and mem-
bers of College Republicans and the Alligator staff will moderate.  Questions have been drafted and reviewed by current and former Alligator staffers to make sure we’re hitting the issues that students care about. 
To prepare, candidates have been provided with a 
list of topics. With three of the parties having confirmed their attendance, we’re looking forward to a truly infor-mative debate. 
So if you’re eating lunch nearby, bring your Chik-fil-
A, Quiznos or Krishna and check it out. The candidates are there for you.
Don’t forget it’s your money at stake, and $13 million 
is not something to brush off or laugh about. 
Elections are your time to participate and determine 
how your money will be spent.
For example, in a Wednesday article, the Alligator 
reported that the Student Senate gave $3,274 to the UF Paintball Team so they could attend the national paint-
ball championships.
Whether you agree with that isn’t really the ques-
tion. 
It’s whether you’re voting for candidates who repre-
sent your views, whatever they may be.
If you don’t vote, then you can’t complain.

So much of America’s success as a country can be traced 
back to the work of our 16th president. From his heroic ef-forts in emancipating the slaves to fighting for national unity, former President Abraham Lincoln set a high standard for every future president to follow. In memory of what would have been his 200th birthday, the Department of Darts &

President Barack Obama is in awe of someone, they must be pretty freaking special.
Word out of South Carolina reveals that the Michael Phelps

Apparently no one wants to be the next secretary of com-

Letters to the Editor
Woman’s courage helps many others
I wanted to commend the courageous 
woman who spoke out against the offensive 
ad run by Gainesville Health and Fitness. 
It depicts what appears to be the ass of a 
prepubescent girl in a feeble attempt to re-
cruit new members. This image and its ac-
companied slogan, “To get here, start here,” sends the message to girls and guys alike that body image should be one’s sole incen-tive to engage in physical activity. 
I completely agree with Wednesday’s 
letter to the editor that this is precisely the attitude towards fitness that drives body dissatisfaction and eating disorders in our 
disillusioned society. This is just one of the 
many advertisements that we are bombard-ed with daily. They are all alike in their mo-tive to stir up deep-seated insecurities and profit from the patronage of the countless Americans who resolved to “get in shape” this New Year. 
Her letter to the editor eloquently illus-
trated how conforming to the media’s twist-
ed standards of beauty will only leave one 
feeling isolated and insufficient. 
I can’t express how honored I am that this 
woman shared her experience with our com-munity. She managed to bring awareness to an epidemic that is pervasive in our world and yet rarely addressed. She unknowingly connected countless readers who have ever felt alone in believing their bodies to be in-adequate or imperfect. 
Namasté, my brave solider of truth. Na-
masté.

Give Orange and Blue a fair shake
It has been disappointing to see letters in 
the Alligator the past few weeks engaging in ad homonym attacks against the Unite Party.
Just like both Progress and Orange and 
Blue, the Unite Party is made up of former members of both parties – myself once be-ing one who voted along Orange and Blue Party lines. 
However, as a former independent can-
didate for Student Senate, one that this very publication endorsed in the fall of 2007, I be-lieve that the Unite Party will move Student Government in a positive new direction 
away from the Gator and Orange and Blue 
parties of old. 
It took a lot to sell me on the idea, but if 
students are willing to give it a chance and look past the “Gator equals Unite” attacks of both the Progress and Orange and Blue Par-ties, I think they will come away convinced as well. From our party president, who isn’t a 
member of Greek life, to our innovative and tangible platform, it is clear that Unite is try-ing to usher in a new era for SG. 
It is time that SG started working for, and 
not against, the students. 
As president of a student organization 
and a former writer for this newspaper, that is something I firmly believe in.

Democrats will eliminate bipartisanship
The recent debacle in Congress over the 
economic stimulus bill has finally dashed the faint light of optimism and faith I had in our elected officials. 
First, let’s look at the Republicans. De-
spite having control of every branch of gov-ernment for six of the past eight years where they have driven the country into economic collapse and have given us record-breaking deficit spending, they continue to maintain that they are the fiscally conservative party that has the right ideas when it comes to the economy. Really? 
How about spending a projected $1 tril-
lion on an utterly unnecessary war in Iraq that has done little besides make Halliburton investors rich? Sound fiscally conservative? Yet when it comes to renovating and 
building new schools for needy districts, 
providing assistance for higher education 
and expanding health care access to over 500,000 people, who are losing their jobs ev-ery month — that’s just being an un-Amer-ican, tax-and-spend liberal. Never mind the fact that the largest single entity of Obama’s plan (about a third) was made up of tax cuts for middle to low income Americans.
Then there are the Democrats, the most 
spineless group of people in power since, well, ever. Let’s remember something: you won. The people wanted something differ-ent. A change in the way of thinking. Some-thing bold. 
Instead, what we got was an evisceration 
of progressive principles in favor of three Republican votes in the Senate. Three! Was it worth it? Because to me, it doesn’t make 
sense to be bipartisan when members of the 
other party are made of a bunch of self-inter-ested half-wits with a piss-poor track record on making decisions.
So, Democratic members of Congress, 
next time the people who have put this country in the worst position in decades tell you what to do, stop being such a wet blan-ket, give them the ol’ one-finger salute, and 
do what is right for once.

Here’s a joke: What’s the only 
thing former Senate Major-ity Leader Tom Daschle 
and notorious gangster Al Capone have in common? 
Neither one seems to care about 
paying their taxes! 
In all seriousness, however, 
why can’t these public officials who President Barack Obama has been appointing to various posts just pay their taxes? 
Daschle, who was up for the 
position of secretary of Health and 
Human Services (and who could 
have had a lead role in implement-ing Obama’s sacred health care re-form), was forced to withdraw his name from consideration. 
In a humorous aside, Daschle’s 
unpaid taxes were against a car and driver furnished for him by a firm he represents in his capacity as a consultant. 
Timothy Geithner, the man who 
became the new Treasury secretary, watched his reputation wither as similar unpaid tax problems were 
brought to light about him. 
Then, on Wednesday, in what 
can only be described as a Sena-
torial sigh-and-eye-roll, Obama’s Labor secretary designee, Hilda Solis, was given a pass and recom-mended for confirmation despite her husband’s unpaid taxes. 
This is getting hilarious.
Now, I’m not going to sit here 
and rant about how failing to pay 
taxes is unpatriotic, and so the Democrats must be traitors. As much as I admire Fox News and Rush Limbaugh (oh and trust me, that’s a lot), I just can’t bring my-self to emulate them in this vein. 
I will say, however, that when you are a public offi-cial, you’re probably en-joying quite a 
few remuner-
ative benefits from your role and con-nections — it 
shouldn’t be this painful for you to fork over some tax money. 
If Daschle, Geithner and the rest 
of the “No Taxation-ers” really find 
it so vulgar to return some of their 
cash to Uncle Sam, they should try assuaging their anger by thinking of all the schools that can be built — or some other equally cheery lie.
The recent outbreak of this tax 
allergy among public officials is indicative of a graver problem — Washington’s love of money. I don’t particularly think this is a surprise to anyone. I, however, would like to go one step further than the usual “throw-the-bums-
out!” rhetoric and offer a truly 
unique and Utopian solution for modern times.
In the world I see, this great 
democracy of ours would be run not by professional politicians, but instead by the Joe Six-Pack com-moners who — at least — pay their taxes (oddly enough, Sarah Palin 
would still qualify for public ser-
vice.). 
Roles of public office, from pres-
ident on down to comptroller, will be “awarded” in a similar manner as jury duty. 
Somewhere a big computer ran-
domizes names from across the na-tion and — just like that — we have our new elected officials. 
These officials would make 
only the same amount of money they were making in their previous professions and enjoy no perks of 
travel or gifts of home remodeling.
Believe me, these individu-
als would be eager to resign from 
public service. At the end of their terms, if a referendum says they did a good job, they never have to serve again. 
If not, they’re back for round 
two. 
And, on their way out the door, 
a large bouncer would turn them upside down and shake them — anything that falls out can go to fund the next stimulus package.
Hard to imagine, I admit, but a 
man can dream…

“CLASSIC COLLEGE TOWN.”
Gainesville was voted No. 9 
on the American Institute for Eco-nomic Research’s top 10 college towns in America.The institute also created three 
other top 10 lists for cities with 
colleges and universities: major 
cities, mid-size metros and small 
cities.
“Gainesville is the classic col-
lege town,” said UF spokesman Steve Orlando.
Orlando said he thinks 
Gainesville belongs in the top 10.
Gainesville is a very affordable 
place for both students and fami-

Orlando said that Gainesville has everything that people look for in a small town, and it has the 
same amenities as the city of Or-
lando.
“We attract world-class enter-
tainment, have great dining and 
have a vast music scene,” he said.Orlando added that there are 
exciting Gator sporting events that attract  many people.

Local businesses expect to rake 
in the usual profit this Valentine’s 
Day season, despite a national sur-vey predicting the average con-sumer will spend about $20 less on 
Valentine’s Day gifts than in 2008.
Some Gainesville shop owners 
said their sales will not be affected 
by the poor economy, despite a survey by the National Retail Fed-eration that predicts less will be spent.
Still, the survey revealed most 
Americans will continue to buy 
traditional holiday favorites, such 
as flowers.
A poll of about 8,850 U.S. 
consumers from Jan. 1 to Jan. 8 showed the average consumer plans to spend about $103 in light of the amorous holiday this year, down from last year’s average of about $123 per person.
But Terri Parker, owner of 
The Flower Shop of Gainesville, said Valentine’s Day flower sales haven’t changed since last year.
Thornebrook Chocolates hasn’t 
seen a change in sales either, said 
Ellen Frattino, a store employee 
who has worked there for more than two years. 
“When it comes to chocolate, 
people aren’t as thrifty,” she said. “People get carried away with 
chocolate, and I don’t think we have any differences in purchas-
es.”
Renaissance Jewelers’ owner 
Robert Peace also said Valentine’s Day sales have not differed from last year. He said the store has actually  experienced increased 
customer traffic because it just re-
located to the Westgate Regency Shopping Center. 
According to the survey, the 
highest-spending age group, 35 to 44 years of age, plans to spend about $119 per person. Young adults, ages 18 to 24, will be the second-highest spenders, with an 
average of $114 per person.
UF freshman Micah Pastula 
said the current economic reces-
sion didn’t affect his spendings be-cause Valentine’s Day is a special, once-a-year event.
Pastula said he bought his 
girlfriend a stuffed dog and a gi-ant singing card. He also plans on serving up a homemade picnic dinner on the beach.
“If you like someone or some-
thing, then money shouldn’t be a boundary,” Pastula said.Businesses expect 
normal holiday sales

something, then money 
shouldn’t be a boundary.”

Ryan- you steal my internet and my
pomegranate juice. You make retarded
jokes, are occasionally kind of smelly,
and don’t appreciate cephalopods enough.Its a good thing I love you because
otherwise I’d be forced to kill you.
Happy Valentines Day babe ♥ Ash

Moira,
Between you & the championship this past year has been great - Let’s keep it up!I love you, Happy Valentines Day.
Hey brother, unless I’m wrong, which you 
know I’m not, it’s been hard (that’s what she said) to see something so Ikki get Chopped. But I will watch it all with you because I love (money) you.To my love Amanda, a day without you is a day without gravity. I fell for you like Newton’s apple fell for his head. The first time I met 
you, the sparks flew like electrons drawn to 
a proton. Our love is now even greater than Avogadro’s number - and that’s saying some-
thing. Please be the chemist that emulsifies 
my heart this Valentine’s Day.
ROO! I love you so much! I understand how 
hard you work to keep everything going and hope it is worth it. So excited to go to Disney 
with you and so happy I found you in L.A. this 
summer.                  Love Always, Madeline
Sam, You make my ♥ go bam!Be my Valentine!
                                          Love you, Kaia
SHANE,
Another Valentines Dayand another chance to say,
It’s wonderful living next door
to someone I adore.                                                Love, Tricia

Ahhhh, Valentine’s Day! I have arrived with

please.” I reply.

you for always believing in me and encourag-

I love you-- more than the domain of y=x^2 
can ever explain!XOXO,

ONLINE SCOREBOARDPOLL QUESTIONBy MIKE DiFERDINANDO
Alligator Staff Writer
mdiferdinando@alligator.org
Dan Werner has always done the small 
things — grabbing the tough rebounds, 
chasing down the loose balls.
His polished passing from the post has 
opened up the offense for more flashy 
players on countless occasions.
But lately, even the little things have 
become a big question mark.
“He made that transformation from his 
freshman year to his sophomore year. He 
kind of carved out a niche and an iden-tity for himself,” UF coach Billy Donovan 
said. “But there is also that individual growth 
where you expect your-
self to now take another step as a player to that next tier, and we’re trying to get him to do that.”
When the Gators make the trip to 
Athens, Ga., on Saturday to take on the 
Bulldogs, Donovan hopes Werner will be 
able to rediscover the form he showed a year ago.
With Werner playing somewhat un-
dersized at the power forward position, he has had to hustle his way to produc-tion.
Even while being outmatched at times 
defensively, Werner has found a way to become a solid defender for UF.
Donovan has even called him one of 
the best defensive players he has ever coached.
“I think the biggest thing for Dan — 
or any frontcourt player where speed or strength or athleticism becomes an issue

Vanderbilt’s Merideth Marsh drives past UF guard Sha Brooks in the first half of 
the Gators’ 84-68 loss to the Commodores on Thursday night in Nashville, Tenn.
� VANDERBILT JUMPED OUT TO A 
12-0 LEAD AND NEVER TRAILED.
By CHRISTOPHER YAZBEC
Alligator Writer
cyazbec@alligator.org
The Gators finally found their poi-
son: playing a hot-shooting team on the 
road.
Preseason Southeastern Confer-
ence favorite Vanderbilt (19-6, 8-2 SEC) jumped out on UF early on Thursday 
night, and the Gators (22-3, 8-2 SEC) could never recover, falling 84-68 in 
Nashville.
The No. 24 Commodores set the tone 
in the first four minutes, a theme that usually belongs to the Gators.
Vanderbilt began the game on a 12-0 
run just 3 1/2 minutes after the tip and sank 6 of 7 3-pointers in the first 8:10, ex-
panding its lead to 24-7.
“They came right out and set the tone, 
set us back on our heels, and they set us so far back on our heels we never could get back up out of that hole,” UF coach 
Amanda Butler said. 
“We just got an old fashion butt-
whooping tonight.”
UF trailed by as many as 17 before 
the break, and it spent the rest of the half scrapping and clawing its way back into 
the game.
The Gators went into the locker room 
down just 37-29, thanks to a rare 5 points from Azania Stewart, who finished with a career-high 16, and a combined three 
3-pointers from Steffi Sorensen and Su-
san Yenser.
But UF could never find a rhythm in 
the second half, having to deal with foul trouble from its best players. Marshae Dotson had two fouls in the first 5:30 of 
the game, and Sha Brooks picked up her 
fourth foul with 4:37 left.

Most college softball teams are 
lucky if they have one dominant 
pitcher, the kind who can throw a shutout on any given day.
Last year, the Gators relied on 
Stacey Nelson to carry the team and step into the circle during every big game. But this season could be different for the UF soft-ball team with the emergence of Stephanie Brombacher, who will play a larger role this season than she did in her freshman year.
“We’ve got two quality No. 1 
pitchers, which is what I’m going to call Stephanie from now on — another No. 1 pitcher,” UF coach Tim Walton said.  
The Gators will host the Lip-
ton Invitational this weekend at Katie Seashole Pressly Stadium, 
where they will play five games in three days, 
and Walton thinks having 
two reliable, 
unique pitchers will give UF a distinct advan-tage.
“It’s very hard to face Stacey and Stephanie in the same day — very, very tough — because one throws the ball totally dif-ferent than the other one, so your eye adjustment better be pretty quick,” Walton said. 
Brombacher, who is more of 
a power pitcher than Nelson, finished the 2008 season with an unprecedented 20-0 record and became the only pitcher in UF history to start her career with more than 10 wins without suf-fering a loss.
This season, the sophomore 
has won both of her starts, struck out 16 batters and only walked one in her 12 innings of work. 
She has started as many games as 
Nelson, who gave up just 1 run in her 14 innings against Baylor last weekend.

The Commodores found them-
selves with more wide-open looks from distance than contested 
shots, and most of the time the ball didn’t even touch the rim as 
it went through the net.
Guard Merideth Marsh and 
forward Christina Wirth made all of Vanderbilt’s 13 threes.
The Commodores, who were 
shooting 62 percent from beyond the arc at one point, finished 13 of 
23 from long range.
“The open looks that we con-
tinued to give them, I think, pri-marily was because of a lack of communication,” Butler said. 
“They just really took it to us, and 
we did very little to try and slow that down.”
UF shot itself in the foot with 
23 turnovers, and Vanderbilt cap-italized on them with 26 points. 
Also not helping their own cause, 
the Gators went just 9 of 20 from the free-throw line.
“We didn’t play with very 
much composure,” Butler said. “We just let down on every front. 
They just out-hustled us. They beat 
us to balls. They were more physi-cal than us. They out-toughed us. 
The list goes on and on.”
The road doesn’t get much eas-
ier for the Gators, who now trail Auburn in the SEC standings by 
a game following the Tigers’ win over Kentucky on Thursday.
UF will travel to Baton Rouge, 
La., on Sunday at 1 p.m. to take on LSU (12-9, 5-4 SEC).

UF forward Dan Werner pressures Mississippi guard David Huertas during the 
Gators’ 78-68 win against the Rebels in the O’Connell Center on Jan. 10.
— I believe in the old adage, ‘Where there’s a will 
there’s a way,’” Donovan said. “You can use your smarts.”
This season however, Werner has struggled to 
put up the numbers he did last year.
He averaged 6.4 rebounds per game as a soph-
omore, but this season he has only managed 4.4. 
He’s second on the team in turnovers, leads the 
team in fouls and is shooting just 33 percent from the field in Southeastern Conference play.
“There are things that, statistically, when you 
look at him, his shooting percentage in the league, his rebounding, there are some areas where he can improve,” Donovan said
Last season, Werner was second on the team in 
rebounding. This year, he checks in fourth behind Alex Tyus, Chandler Parsons and point guard Nick Calathes.
“A lot of times it comes down to you have an 
internal drive and commitment to yourself to say, ‘You know what? I’m going to play better,’” Donovan said.  “I think he has done a lot of great things that don’t show up in the stat sheet, but 
certainly I think that there is more he can do.”
DONOVAN UNSURE OF CALATHES’ FUTURE:  With 
his standout sophomore season, there has been 
increasing speculation that this may be Calathes’ 
last year in Gainesville.
But according to Donovan, the NBA is the last 
thing on his star’s mind.
“I haven’t talked to anybody about that, and 
that includes people at the next level,” Donovan 
said. “I really believe Nick’s focus is on helping our team.”
If Calathes did want to test the NBA waters, 
Donovan is in a position to ensure the right deci-sion is made.
“Stu Jackson, who handles all that stuff and 
works in the NBA office, coached me in college, so there is a very close relationship there. I’m able to get a lot of honest and relevant information that allows guys to get to the next level,” Donovan said. “It would be the same situation as a guy like Marreese Speights. I really don’t have any idea with Nick.”Donovan challenges junior forward to do more for team

LEADING BY EXAMPLE.
By TOnI-Ann MILLer
Alligator Writer
Leaders come in two forms: 
those who are vocal — the Tim 
Tebows of the world — and  those who choose to lead only by their examples.
Heading into split track and 
field meets, UF’s veterans have been the latter, and they look to continue their impressive on-field leadership.
The Gators will send the throw-ing squad and coach Steve Lemke to Ames, Iowa for the Iowa State Classic. The remainder of the team 
will head to the Tyson Invitational 
in Fayetteville, Ark.
The decision to split the team 
was a fairly simple one for coach Mike Holloway.
“The Tyson meet, the way it’s 
set up, is not a very good venue for throwing,” Holloway said. “We felt like going to Iowa State was a much 
better venue for the throwers and 
also some great competition.” 
In Iowa, junior shot-putter Mar-
iam Kevkhishvili will lead UF’s throwers. 
Kevkhishvili is not the archetype of a vocal leader, but her on-field performance in the shot put speaks for itself.
Kevkhishvili has thrown NCAA 
automatic-qualifying distances of 55 feet, 10.5 inches; 56 feet; and 56 feet, 2 inches in the team’s three meets this season. 
Kevkhishvili is also the recipi-
ent of two Southeastern Conference weekly awards but does not focus on these accolades. She believes there is much more left in her.
“I’m still in the weight-lifting 
program, so I’m not throwing far yet,” Kevkhishvili said. “I think I can throw farther. I’m ready for big throws.”
Of the group heading to the Ty-
son Invitational, senior Carlos Phil-lips hopes to be an example for his teammates by bettering his season-best time of 1:49.86 in the 800-meter run.“This weekend I’m going to be 
in one of the faster heats, so I’m try-ing to go ahead and break my sea-
son time,” Phillips said. “Hopefully 
this week I can get an automatic time.”
As a senior, Phillips under-
stands that some of his younger teammates look up to him, and he embraces the role.
“Whether I want to or not, I 
have to set an example,” Phillips 
said. “On the track, I always do the 
workouts and never shortcut any-thing.”
This weekend’s split meets will 
be the final events for UF before the SEC Indoor Championships.

UF falls one 
game behind Auburn in SEC
After last season, Brom-
bacher went to her coach and 
said she wanted the ball more, and Walton took that as a sign that she was ready to be a more consistent option in the circle.
“She’s now taking her abil-
ity to be mentally tough and to pitch against the better teams,” he said. “She’s not afraid of Francesca Enea in intrasquad (scrimmages). She’s ready to go after her, and that is what catapults her into wanting the ball against the quality oppo-nents we’re going to face this year.”
Nelson, who led the nation 
in wins (47) and had the fourth-
lowest ERA (0.76) while pitch-
ing 352.1 innings last season, will still get more than 50 per-cent of the starts, Walton said. Despite Brombacher’s impres-sive performance in fall and preseason practices, the senior remains the unquestioned ace.Rather than seeing the 
younger pitcher as a threat to her position, Walton said Nel-son realizes Brombacher can 
help her improve, and Nelson can help Brombacher 
turn into a more 
complete pitcher.
“They’re a 
great team to-
gether,” Walton said. “They work together, have a great chemistry together, and it’s never really about pitting any-one against each other.”
Nelson said she has wel-
comed Brombacher’s expand-ed role with open arms and has benefited from having another reliable pitcher in the rotation.
“I don’t really feel like I 
help her — not that I don’t, but everything she’s done has been on her own,” Nelson said. “She’s a great pitcher. She’s grown over the past year and learned how to pitch at this level.”
Walton not concerned about pitting pitchers against each other

UF senior runnerMahlich returns home for meet against Michigan State24, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 13, 2009
� THIS MARKS UF’S SECOND 
ROAD CONTEST IN A ROW.
By EUGENIO TORRENS
Alligator Writer
For Elizabeth Mahlich, the trip 
north to East Lansing, Mich., this 
weekend is more of a homecom-
ing than a road meet.
Mahlich grew up in Mason, 
Mich., about a 20-minute drive from East Lansing, and is ready 
to see friends and family cheering 
her in a less-hostile crowd than most away meets.
“It’ll be fun competing at a 
meet that I always used to go to,” Mahlich said. 
The No. 9 Gators (3-2, 2-2 
Southeastern Conference) will face Michigan State on Saturday, 
treating the team to a homey feel Friday night.
“They’re all excited to have a 
nice home-cooked meal instead of 
a catered one,” Mahlich said.
She said the team will be vis-
iting her house Friday night and that it will be a radical change of scenery.
“Going to our actual house and 
knowing how and where I used to live will probably be a little differ-ent and exciting for (the team),” she said. 
“I live out in the country, 
around absolutely no one, so it’s going to be a lot different.”
UF coach Rhonda Faehn sees 
this meet as a showcase event for 
the all-around freshman.
“Elizabeth has done a tremen-
dous job for this team this year,” 
Faehn said. “She’s really stepped up as a freshman and has really just come out in pressure situa-tions and done a great job. We’re really excited for her to be able go home to see her family, to see her friends, but also to show them just 
what a great job she’s doing for 
this program.”
The Gators will take on the 
Spartans (5-8) in their first road meet against a non-SEC opponent. 
That may be good news since the 
team is 0-2 on the road this sea-son. 
Both losses came against SEC 
opponents, including a loss on the road at LSU on Feb. 6.
“There’s nothing to lose,” ju-
nior Melanie Sinclair said. “We’ve gone into two away meets already and have had not-so-good experi-
ences. (We) might as well go out 
and give it our all.”
Even though ranking- and re-
cord-wise Michigan State may be 
one of the weakest teams on UF’s 
schedule, Faehn wants her team to focus internally more than any-thing else.
“We don’t ever look at who 
we’re competing against as far as how we’re supposed to perform,” Faehn said. 
“We have something we have 
to prove. We have to turn this sea-son around.”
The team improved its per-
formance against LSU, and even though it wasn’t enough for the win, Sinclair pointed out the meet’s positives.
“We just have little flukes here 
and there,” Sinclair said. 
“Overall it was a decent com-
petition, and it makes you feel good that knowing that even though we did have mistakes, we kept a positive attitude, we kept 
the composure as a team that we 
needed to keep.”
In a sport that focuses more on 
individual performance, having that team energy is vital for the 
rest of the squad.
Faehn wants her gymnasts to 
start the meet with energy and 
have it snowball.
UF opens the meet on bars be-
cause it is the road team. Mahlich is penciled in for the first spot.
“What a way to start out the 
competition,” Faehn said.JUMPBALL
Disclaimer: I have a lot of respect for 
Nick Calathes and Billy Donovan, so do not misunderstand the tone of this letter. It is designed to be a joke, is very tongue-in-cheek and only intends to make you laugh — but maybe make a 
few points along the way.
Dear Nick,
Alright, I understand there is 
simply no way you’re going to be a 
four-year player here at UF. But hey, can I 
just get a third year?
I know everyone is going to be telling you 
to leave for the NBA after this season.
“Nick Calathes could be a lottery pick,” 
one NBA analyst will say.  “Definitely a first-round pick,” another expert will add.
I know this season has worn on you. I 
told you things wouldn’t be that bad after the departure of Marreese Speights — Al-right, I was wrong.
And yes, it’s pretty pitiful that you went 
for a career-high 33 points at Rupp and we couldn’t close it out despite Kentucky miss-ing Patrick Patterson near the end.
But come on man, we’re making prog-
ress. I’m pretty sure we can’t find a way to miss the NCAA Tournament this year, though we could use a third scoring option.
And yeah, you 
might win SEC Player of the Year this year, but you would be a lock next season! 
We’re only losing 
Walter.  And the SEC 
will likely still be down. We could put an-other banner up in the O’Dome.
Next year, you’d get to play with two real 
big men with Vernon Macklin being eligible. Imagine that! TWO great big men!
Your buddy Chandler will still be here, 
and you can each get more chances next 
year to not miss critical free throws with the 
game on the line. (Oops, is that still a sensi-tive spot?)
And your stock surely wouldn’t go down 
by sticking around. Maybe next year I could even get you guys to play defense! C’mon man, take a page out of Tebow’s book — let’s do it again next year (but better)!
Yours truly,
Billy D.Should Calathes stay to improve fundamentals or make jump to NBA?
Here’s what Nick Calathes excels 
at and why NBA teams will draft him:
1. He sees the floor as well as any 6-foot-
6-inch player can.
2. He’s a point guard, and he’s 6 feet 6 
inches tall. 
3. His shot is getting better and his 
shooting range extends out to the NBA 3-point line.
And here’s why they will pass on him:
1. He is not a top-notch athlete. Chan-
dler Parsons jokes he can’t even jump over 
one of the Alligator’s weekday editions.
2. He won’t ever be a great one-on-one 
defender because of that lack of athleti-cism.
3. His shot isn’t at an elite level and he 
doesn’t have a quick release.
Now, can Calathes improve on those 
strengths? Yes, but he is already at the elite level in college. There are very few players who see the floor as well as he does, and there is nobody who has his size to go with that playmaking ability. 
If teams are looking for a playmaker in 
the draft, Calathes will be one of the first they think of. And what about 
those faults? Calathes isn’t turning into an exceptional athlete or a shut-down defend-er. Those aren’t areas he was blessed in.
That is why he’s 
ready for the NBA af-ter this year.
If Calathes wants 
to stay at UF and have a shot at making a deep tournament run, good for him. It won’t hurt his draft status or how he’ll play in the NBA. If he’s ready, however, to be financially set for the rest of his life, then let him go to the NBA. 
He’s got skills teams can use, and those 
aren’t going to get much better at the col-lege level. His talents will improve when he’s playing with NBA athletes who will force him to study the game even more. 
Nothing against UF strength and con-
ditioning coordinator Matt Herring, but NBA coaches can help Calathes add more muscle and fine-tune his shot more when he doesn’t have to worry about that Man’s Food test.
