For many residents, January’s util-
ity charges were higher than previous 
months’.  
Some residents are expressing skep-
ticism about why their bills were so 
expensive, but Gainesville Regional 
Utilities has chalked it up to last month’s high frequency of freezing temperatures, said Jim Gilmartin, a GRU engineer util-ity designer.
Homes in Florida are better designed 
for cooling than for heating, he said. Some students live in older homes that don’t insulate heat as well.
Despite the weather, off-campus stu-
dents and residents still said they were surprised when their bills for last month shot above previous months.
Keira Pelletier, a 22-year-old UF al-
muna who lives downtown, said she doesn’t understand why her bill dou-bled.
“I didn’t feel that we used the heat 
as much,” Pelletier said. “We went out of  the way to be conservative to actually keep the bill down.”
Pelletier said she’s heard of friends 
and strangers whose bills were higher than normal.
“I was on the phone in the gro-
cery store talking about my high GRU bill, and this guy in front of me turned around and commented on how high his bill was, too,” she said. “Everybody seems to be dealing with this.”
UF women’s studies junior Ana Fa-
jardo said she was confused by her bill as well.
“I wasn’t even at my house for a lot of 
January, so my bill wasn’t logical to me,” said Fajardo, 20. “I’d like to know how VOLUME 108 ISSUE 107 WWW.ALLIGATOR.ORG TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 25, 2014

Alligator Contributing Writer
The 58th Annual Miss UF 
Pageant, sponsored by Flori-
da Blue Key, crowned Eliza-
beth Fechtel as its new Miss 
UF Monday night.
Alison Hassell, pageant 
executive director, estimated 
1,000 guests attended this 
year’s pageant, which was themed “Where the girls are the fairest.”
Hassell, a 21-year-old UF 
business management junior, said one of the goals for this year’s pageant was to in-crease the diversity within the pageant contestants.
“This year, we have 18 
contestants,” Hassel said. “We’ve increased the number ... To have a lot of different diversity in our group is ex-
citing.”
This year’s pageant con-testants displayed a range of 
talents, including piano recit-als, West African dance and martial arts.
Attendees paid about $15 
to watch the women compete for the crown. Hassell said proceeds go toward Dance Marathon’s charity, the Chil-
dren’s Miracle Network.
Rachel Hart, last year’s 
winner, said Miss UF should 
represent The Gator Nation.
“We wanted Miss UF to be 
more accessible and attain-able,” Hart said, “as well as approachable this year.”
Hart, a 20-year-old UF 
advertising sophomore, said she and Hassell announced the event to multiple orga-nizations to try and get the 
word out.
She said she refers to her 
Miss UF status in third per-
son to emphasize the objec-tivity of her role.
“People don’t really care 
that Miss UF is Rachel Hart,” 
she said.
Hart said being Miss UF 
has made her evaluate how 
she represents herself.
One of the contestants in 
the event was 21-year-old Stephanie Tinoco, a UF tele-communication junior. 
She said her experience 
coaching the Boys & Girls Club of Alachua County in its ﬁ  rst pageant pushed her to compete in a pageant herself.
“After the pageant (my 
students said), ‘Coach Steph-anie, you should compete, you should compete,’” Ti-noco said. “And I said, ‘All 
right, well, I’m gonna do this 
for my girls.’”

ley Innis, a 19-year-old UF 
psychology freshman, said

A recent breach in security for Apple de-
vices has put users’ data at risk, but UF wire-
less users are safe – as long as they stay on the 
university’s network.
Apple released a patch for its mobile devic-
es over the weekend that ﬁ  xes the hole in se-
curity, but UF Information Technology com-
munications manager Tracy Gale said Apple 
laptops and desktops are still vulnerable.
Gale said the university’s network security 
will keep its users safe, but they still need to update their mobile devices as soon as they 
can.
“At no time has your Apple device been 
more vulnerable,” she said. “This patch is 
critical.”
She said if laptop and desktop users take their computers off campus, they should avoid using Safari because hackers are using the browser to steal information. Apple said 
a patch for its computer operating system is 
coming soon but didn’t give a deﬁ  nite release date.
UFIT released a list of security tips on its 
website Monday explaining how to minimize risks when using Apple devices.
Gina Cassulo, a 19-year-old UF environ-
mental engineering freshman, said she didn’t know her iPhone was at risk.
Cassulo said having her information stolen 
“would be awful.”
“I don’t do banking much on there,” she 
said “but I use my email for everything.”Hackers poison Apple, but

� IT SUPPORTS RAPE VICTIMS.
ALISSA KOTRANZA
Alligator Contributing Writer
A county advisory board for rape victims 
has six slots open.
Applications for the Alachua County Vic-
tim Services & Rape Crisis Center Advisory 
Council are due Friday. 
Those who serve on the council are in 
charge of local events that support victims of sexual assault or violence and must atte meet-
ings once a month.
The openings can be ﬁ  lled by any resident, 
student or employee of the county. 
“The main thing to know on the board is 
that you don’t have to be a victim to be on 
the board,” said Jeremy Clements, advisory board coordinator.   
The positions are available to students 
who wish to apply, but Clements said the 
timetable makes it more difﬁ  cult for students to gain a spot because many leave Gainesville soon after graduation. Once a position on the board is assigned, it’s active for three years, 
he said. So far, Clements said ﬁ  ve people 
have applied. 
Kayla Ventura, a 20-year-old UF health 
sciences sophomore, said a place on the board would be a great opportunity for stu-dents who are passionate about victims’ ad-vocacy. Ventura is part of a University Police program that lets students work with UF’s professional victims’ advocates.
“UF students can raise attention to the is-
sues that contribute to rape and assault on campus,” Ventura said. “It would be awe-some to really make a difference.” Six slots open on advisory boardCAMPUS

At a roundtable discussion Monday, 
UF leaders presented their ideas on schol-
arship.
The public discussion held in Emer-
son Alumni Hall included Provost Joseph 
Glover, David Guzick, senior vice presi-
dent for health affairs, and Jack Payne, senior vice president for agriculture and natural resources.
Mike Foley, a master lecturer in the 
College of Journalism and Communica-tions, facilitated the conversation.
The discussion is the ﬁ  rst part in a se-
ries of talks hosted by the UF Faculty Sen-
ate. Guzick spoke about the evolution of 
scholarship and its role in academic health centers.
Guzick said scholarship and research are the foundation of UF’s reputation.
“It is the academic health center that 
brings scholarship together with educa-tion and clinical service in a positive feed-back loop,” he said.
Payne said scholarship is broader than 
research published in a peer-reviewed journal.
“We in IFAS place a high value on 
scholarly achievements but extend the concept of scholarship beyond research,” he said.Leaders discuss scholarship

Gilmartin offered customers tips such as 
keeping the heat temperature at 68 degrees,. Students such as Ray Odeh, a 20-year-old UF 
horticultural sciences sophomore, said past util-ity bills taught him to keep January’s bill low.
“The only electricity I use will be for my ap-
pliances, like my stove and refrigerator,” Odeh 
said. “It kept the costs a lot lower.”
As for Pelletier, she remains skeptical about 
her bill amount.
“I definitely think the temperature had 
something to do with it,” she said, “but not as 
much as our bill was implying.” � HE HIT HIS HEAD DURING 
PRACTICE IN 2013.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
TAMPA — A Tampa high school 
football player who hit his head 
during practice in 2013 intends to sue the Hillsborough County School District, saying a piece of unattend-
ed equipment and a trainer’s delay 
in seeking medical attention put his life in danger.Wharton High School player 
Sean McNamee wasn’t wearing a helmet when warming up before 
drills in October. He lost his balance 
and struck an unattended paint ma-chine used to line the field.
He was in a coma for nine days. 
Doctors told his family the 16-year-old might not survive. McNamee emerged from the coma but has a ti-tanium plate in his head and requires physical and cognitive therapy, said 
his attorney, Steve Yerrid.
“There is no question, Sean suf-fered a devastating and permanent 
brain injury that will have signifi-cant adverse impacts upon him for 
the rest of his life,” Yerrid wrote in a 
letter to the district’s attorney dated Friday.
The letter serves as a notice of 
intent to sue the school district; to sue a government entity in Florida, the plaintiff must send the notice six months before the intended lawsuit.
State law allows a maximum 
$200,000 in damages if the school district is found liable in this case. If a jury were to find the school dis-trict liable for an amount more than $200,000, the Florida Legislature 
would have to approve the amount 
in what is called a claims bill.
On Oct. 16, 2013, McNamee was 
a linebacker/defensive end and was playing catch with some teammates before drills. Yerrid said McNamee lost his balance, came into contact with another player and hit the field striping machine.
Security cameras on campus 
show McNamee walking into the locker room, holding his head. About 30 minutes later, McNamee’s car is seen leaving campus, and 
his sister found him disoriented at 
home. The teen’s family rushed him to the hospital where he was placed in a medically induced coma and had part of his skull removed.
Yerrid wrote that the team’s 
trainer, who knew about the injury, “failed to adhere to proper protocol to evaluate Sean’s condition and ob-
tain appropriate medical interven-
tion.”4, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 25, 2014

Tampa high school athlete to sue school district after injury � IT WILL BE ON THE PLAZA 
OF THE AMERICAS.

Students will have a new place to 
find themselves this year.
For the first time, UF’s annual 
Majors & Minors Fair will be on the 
Plaza of the Americas. Sponsored 
by the Career Resource Center and 
the Student Government Academics Cabinet, the event will be held from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Wednesday.
CRC assistant director for mar-
keting and communications Dana McPherson said the fair was previ-ously held on the Reitz Union Col-onnade, but organizers had to find 
a new location because of the con-
struction.
Angel Iverson, CRC assistant di-
rector of career events, said the plaza was chosen because of the high vol-ume of student traffic.
“I expect the same amount of traf-
fic as last time, especially since we’re 
doing a lot of promoting,” she said.
Andy Escobar, a 22-year-old UF 
food and resource economics senior, 
said he feels the same way about the location.
“I think it might actually increase 
the number of students who show up because Plaza of the Americas is a bit more centrally located,” he 
said.
Representatives from more than 
45 colleges and departments will be 
in attendance to answer questions from students about possible cours-es of study.
“We host the fair to give depart-
ments the chance to connect with students,” Iverson said, “in order to 
educate them on majors and minors 
that are offered that students may not know of.”UF majors fair makes

The central staircase in the Reitz Union will 
be taken out over Spring Break as part of the 
next major step in the Make It Reitz renova-tion.
In its place, stacking bathrooms on every 
floor will be constructed, said Eddie Daniels, a Make it Reitz advisory committee member and executive director of the Reitz Union.
“It’s being closed off, and it’s not coming back,” Daniels said.
Construction will begin at the end of this 
week. In the meantime, there will be signs directing students to the existing staircases and elevators in the Reitz, Daniels said. The 
changes are also updated on the Make it Reitz 
website.
“There will be some inconvenience and 
certainly some change from what people are used to, but we’re gonna try and make it as painless as possible,” Daniels said. “We have to go through the sacrifice because, you know, there is no other place on campus where we can move the union to while we rebuild this.”
Abbie Ripple, a 20-year-old UF journalism 
junior, said she was unaware the staircase was closing, and she had concerns about the effects of the renovations on students.“The noise, the clutter and the inaccessibil-
ity are all major players in making these reno-vations so inconvenient to students,” Ripple said. “I wish they would have waited or at least taken it one project at a time.”
Julie Coutu, a 20-year-old UF women’s 
studies sophomore, said she agreed the reno-vations are an inconvenience to students who use the Reitz often.
“It’s already hard enough to get around 
with all the construction,” Coutu said. “I guess I’ll just be taking the elevator now.”Reitz central staircase to be removed during Spring Break

Old magazines became art at Sustainable 
UF’s first Green-It-Yourself event of the year 
Monday evening in Weil Hall.
The event was conducted as a workshop: 
Interns provided pre-cut cardboard frames, 
magazines and other supplies and taught 
about 20 participants to fashion the materials into art projects.
“The whole purpose of this event is to use 
materials that you already have laying around and to have fun and create projects that you and your friends can enjoy,” said Joy Fahz, a 
Sustainable UF intern.
The 20-year-old UF management senior co-
hosted the event with two other Sustainable 
UF interns.
The organization provides interns with 
an opportunity to run and promote Green-It-
Yourself events, said Laurel Nesbit, a graduate 
assistant at the Office of Sustainability. They are tasked with creating unique ideas that en-courage sustainability awareness.   “We give the interns a lot of freedom,” she 
said.
Intern Laura McCann said she reuses ob-
jects she finds all the time. She said she’s cur-rently decorating a mirror left behind by a pre-vious tenant and finds inspiration for projects on the Internet.
“Any time we have any inkling of an idea, 
we go on Pinterest,” the 21-year-old UF envi-ronmental science senior said. “There’s always instructions.”
Attendees crafted bookmarks, coasters and picture frames from the provided materials.
Hollyn Hartog, a 19-year-old UF explor-
atory engineering freshman, said she values 
Sustainable UF’s initiatives on campus.
“They raise advocacy about waste pro-
duced and encourage people to get crafty,” 
she said.

UF plans to continue its rise to-
ward national preeminence with the 
help of a new donation intended to promote hiring and research.
UF alumnus Andrew Banks, his wife Pamela and their family com-mitted $5 million to the university, inspired by the recent drive to rein-force UF’s national position as a pre-
mier university, UF officials recently 
announced.
“The Banks family recognized the 
importance of UF rising in national stature, and they have stepped for-ward to make that a reality,” said UF spokesman Steve Orlando. 
The Florida Legislature recently signed a bill designating UF as one of the state’s preeminent universities and providing $15 million annually for the next five years to support the 
university’s goal of becoming a top 
U.S. public research institution.
The university will match the 
$75-million, in-state funding as part of the UF Preeminence Plan, said Tom Mitchell, vice president for de-velopment and alumni affairs.
“This is a group of leaders that have come together to launch a shared vision: enhancing UF’s posi-tion among the best public research universities in the country,” he said. 
Part of the Banks’ gift will endow 
faculty positions.
During the next five years, UF is 
planning to create at least 100 more faculty endowments, bringing the university’s total to 500.
The family was one of the first to 
support UF’s Machen Florida Op-portunity Scholars program, which provides scholarships to first-gener-ation college students from econom-ically disadvantaged backgrounds.
“These individuals will be schol-
ars in their field that will attract the brightest and the best students,” Mitchell said. “They will attract re-search funding. They will attract other prominent faculty in the field and enhance our position among the best.”

an unfair indicator 
Luckily, our FCAT days are behind us. After all, the 
snacks used as bribery tactics and all of the time out of 
class in the world couldn’t make up for the fact that state 
standardized testing is a waste of schools’ time and an unfair indicator of teacher and student success. 
Standardized testing is problematic for a number of rea-
sons: A year’s worth of learning is supposed to be demon-
strated in a two-day testing period, and teachers are conﬁ  ned to teaching only the material covered on the test. Obviously, 
students learn at different paces and are at different skill lev-
els for certain subjects, so the standardized testing model has long been criticized as a poor measure of a child’s learning. 
Many teachers are outraged at the idea of merit pay based 
on standardized testing scores. On Monday, “complex scores used in pay decisions of Florida public school teachers” were 
released, according to the Orlando Sentinel. 
The scores, known as “Value-Added Model” numbers, 
supposedly show the impact a teacher has on his or her stu-
dents’ FCAT scores. 
The ﬁ  rst point of criticism the scores received, the Sentinel 
stated, is that about 70 percent of Florida teachers cover sub-
jects not considered by state testing. The Sentinel highlighted 
the case of one P.E. teacher whose score is calculated based on the reading performance of 70 fourth-graders. 
According to the Sentinel, “‘We do not have a fair system in 
place,” said Diana Moore, the president of the Orange County Classroom Teachers Association. “We have a system that eval-
uates some teachers on their own students and most teachers 
on students they never see.”
In addition, Moore said, the formula used for calculating 
the VAM score is so convoluted that most teachers and stu-dents can’t explain it. It also doesn’t take into account a myri-
ad of factors: a students’ parental involvement and how well 
a student handles tests. 
Few are in support of the VAM teacher-pay calculation 
model. This year, VAM scores will determine the wage of 40 
percent of Florida public school teachers’ salaries. 
Florida’s standardized-testing problem needs a solution. 
While merit-based pay for teachers makes sense on paper, the reality is that many facts are outside of a teacher’s control 
when it comes to instructing a variety of students with differ-ent socioeconomic backgrounds and learning capabilities. 
“Teachers oppose the tests because they’re at odds with 
deep-seated American values about individual differences 
and worth,” wrote Valerie Strauss for the Washington Post.  
“(The tests) undermine a fundamental democratic principle that those closest to and therefore most knowledgeable about 
problems are best positioned to deal with them.”
Indeed, Florida needs to take a more individualistic ap-
proach when it comes to evaluating public-school students. 
One dumbed-down standardized test only teaches students 
to hate math and reading, and basing merit pay on these tests 
punishes one of the most important — and most marginalized — group of public servants: teachers. For decades, popular food franchises and the Ameri-
can food industry have fought tooth and nail while the majority of the public just sits around and watches 
— or eats.
Many consumers, including myself, have developed 
an ignorance of what exactly is in the meat they are eating when they pick up a package at the grocery store or order a 
burger from a fast-food chain. Although some documenta-
ries highlight the horrors of mass meat production, it seem-ingly isn’t enough to dissuade people from buying these products. This is because our food industry has not offered a better solution to feeding the growing population.
In August 2013, well-known hamburger chef Jamie Oli-
ver won a small victory with McDonald’s. He revealed its hamburger meat, which is really just the fatty remnants of a cow, was washed in ammonium hydroxide to make these 
nasty remnants ﬁ  t for human consumption.
These hamburgers are hardly ﬁ  t to feed your pets, and 
millions of humans are ingesting them daily. Oliver also 
revealed how chicken nuggets are made. After the best parts of the chicken are chosen, the remaining fat, skin and 
internal organs are processed for the nuggets. So yes, Mc-
Donald’s, I guess you could technically say your nuggets are 100-percent real chicken. As far as we know, this only applies to the McDonald’s locations in the U.S., as franchise 
managers in Latin America, Ireland and the U.K. have stat-
ed they use meat from local suppliers instead. The Ameri-can McDonald’s has since promised to change its recipe. But I’ll believe it when I see it.
Last week, Nestle recalled certain Hot Pockets because 
8.7 million pounds of meat that was — and has been — used in its Philly cheesesteak-ﬂ  avored sandwiches had been from “diseased and unsound animals” without full inspection.
How in the world did this meat get so far as to make 
it into someone’s freezer? How poor must the inspection process be at these slaughterhouses?In a world where our food 
industry seem impenetrable and set in its ways, Perdue and Ty-
son, two major chicken compa-
nies, have come out with new antibiotic-free chicken products. This trend has also started hitting 
Chick-ﬁ  l-A, which announced it 
would phase out the use of anti-biotic-treated chickens within the 
next ﬁ  ve years. The problem with the antibiotics in our food is it leads to more antibiotic-resistant bacteria in animals. 
These bacteria then infect the people who eat them.
Chipotle Mexican Grill went antibiotic-free more than 10 
years ago and requires its suppliers to meet “humane hous-
ing standards” for chickens.
Unfortunately, not all other food sources are jumping on 
the humane train, but we should take a win when we see one.
All is not lost. Consumers can control more than they 
think. Most grocery stores nowadays have multiple food 
purchasing options. Unfortunately, most humane, organic, 
antibiotic-free options are more expensive, but you are pay-ing for a better outcome for yourself.
Eggs and chicken can be purchased cage-free and or-
ganically at your local Publix or Trader Joe’s. Buy beef and pork that was raised and slaughtered organically and hy-gienically. Most times, you are only spending an extra few bucks to get better quality food. It’s time we, as consumers, take a stand against these mass processing industries and 
tell them what we want to spend our money on.
There is an ease of mindlessness when it comes to what 
you’re putting in your stomach, but food ignorance is not 
health bliss.

Bearded ladies used to be ogled for entertainment as a part 
of freak shows that were popular from the mid-1800s to mid-1900s, but bearded ladies still exist today. 
Women are able to grow beards 
due to disorders, such as congenital 
generalized hypertrichosis termina-
lis and polycystic ovary syndrome. Harnaam Kaur is one such woman who receives stares on the street and taunts from bullies about her facial hair. The 23-year-old from Slough, U.K., was made to feel so ashamed about the way she looked that she isolated herself in her house, began to harm herself and consid-
ered suicide. 
Kaur was 11 when hair started growing on her body. In or-
der to ﬁ  t into society’s standards of gender, Kaur tried to re-
move or conceal her hair. She waxed it twice a week, and when that was too painful, she tried shaving and bleaching it. She wore baggy clothes to cover herself up and hid her face with her hands while talking. 
But by 16, she decided to accept her body after being bap-
tized as a Sikh. According to the religion, the body should be left in its natural state, so Kaur left her hair alone and let it grow. Now, seven years later, she says she is more conﬁ  dent in her body than ever before. 
She told Barcroft Media, “This is who I am. I’m different, 
and I’ve learned to accept it fully.” 
Some people may say Kaur shouldn’t be called brave just 
because she has polycystic ovary syndrome. But I will make the same argument I made for Ellen Page last week: It’s not that Page’s sexuality or Kaur’s syndrome that make them brave, but it’s how they are accepting themselves despite societal norms. 
By embracing her hair, Kaur is rebelling again prescribed 
gender roles, and that should be an inspiration to all women. People would call Kaur “beardo” instead of weirdo or “she-man” and “she-male.” She has even received death threats for 
the way she looks. 
These comments show that society’s ideas of masculine and 
feminine beauty are very rigid. The experience of this one wom-
an highlights the overall issue of gender inequality. Some men grow hair, and some don’t; some women grow hair, and some don’t. All should be OK and celebrated. 
Kaur deﬁ  es the concept of what women “should” look like. 
“I feel more feminine, more sexy, and I think I look it too,” she told Barcroft Media. 
Many of us have characteristics we don’t like about our-
selves: our crooked noses or that one oddly placed mole or that jagged scar, but once we love ourselves like Kaur, we won’t care what anyone else thinks.
As my girl Tina Fey says, “Do your thing, and don’t care if 
they like it.”

opinions@alligator.orgMost UF stu-
dents are by now famil-
iar with the ongoing situation on campus. 
If you’ve read the 
disturbing ways the Swamp Party main-tains its control over student leadership — as reported widely in the Alligator and the Fine Print — it’s not pleas-ant. 
Ahead of us, there are two 
roads. The only remaining ques-tion: Which road will we take?
For years, we’ve been hearing 
of how fraternity members have been systematically exploited for the System’s beneﬁ  t. The latest ex-ample was mentioned in a letter to the editor in Friday’s paper, aptly titled, “Swamp’s intimidation tac-
tics are reprehensible.” 
Am I being too idealistic in be-
lieving that even the most apathetic 
student gets slightly disturbed by these reports?
This is why we have to take the 
road less traveled. UF students are far too compassionate, gutsy and courageous to sit back and watch 
as details of corruption within stu-
dent leadership emerge regularly. A fresh approach is needed for ﬁ  x-ing this crisis.  
With all due respect to minority 
parties, it’s highly dubious to expect genuine change to come through running for Student Government. It’s almost impossible to rival the 
System’s intimidation techniques. 
And for those who are waiting for the UF administration to volun-tarily address these issues, why not dream bigger and expect Gov. Chris Christie to address global cor-ruption?
What we need is a nonpartisan group, not a new po-litical party, that will bring a fresh approach in addressing our piti-ful campus culture. 
The goals are simple: 
to demand ethics, transparency and de-mocracy to govern every aspect of our 
campus.
This nonpartisan group, not 
dependent on SG funds, should be modeled around credible hu-
man rights organizations, such as 
Amnesty International. This orga-nization would perform two func-tions that neither the media nor the government — in our case, the Al-ligator and the UF administration, respectively — can do sustainably: raise awareness by investigating abuses of power while also mobiliz-
ing the larger UF community to put 
pressure on responsible parties.
There’s a reason our state and 
national politics suck. Just go back to the campus culture our politi-cians were brought up in.
The extent to which we can re-
form the climate of student leader-ship at UF is equal to the extent we 
have already nipped the bud of cor-
ruption from growing in Tallahas-see, or worse yet, Washington, D.C. 
The week after Spring Break, I 
will personally meet with anyone who is similarly disturbed by our student leadership’s moral decline. Since I’m a senior and have few campuswide networking skills, I 
look forward to a fresh set of minds 
and hearts — not driven by egos or pursuit of resume titles, but rather by genuine passion — taking the mantle of ethical leadership at UF.

opinions@alligator.orgwhich have garnered attention through 
social media. This past weekend, my news feed was ﬁ  lled with posts sharing a video titled, “What’s going on in Ven-ezuela in a nutshell” and hashtags like 
#prayforvenezuela. I was immediately 
reminded of the frenzy involved with KONY 2012 in which people became “experts” on Uganda overnight.
The one-sided video about Venezue-
la portrays the country as undemocratic and a place of tyranny. It ignored the fact that Nico-lás Maduro and 
Hugo Chávez 
were democrati-cally elected and that Venezuela had a voter turnout of about 80 percent in the October 2012 election when Chávez was re-elected; something that seems impossible in American national elections. Elections in Venezuela are also monitored by 
the Carter Center, which has called the 
elections there some of the freest in the world. Claims that Maduro doesn’t have a mandate seems to be simply rhetoric for those wanting a regime change with a more pro-western, neo-liberal president.
A common response to election re-
sults is that the poor and uneducated 
were bribed because democracy can 
only exist when the party a country’s elite supports is in power.
There are plenty of Americans who 
question the legitimacy of the Obama administration, and if they were mobi-lized in a violent manner and called for a coup, the response from our govern-ment would be militant. America has a 
history of involvement in Latin Ameri-
ca: The CIA supported a failed coup at-tempt in Venezuela in 2002 that largely failed because the Venezuelan masses rallied beyond Chávez.
The video and anti-Maduro slacktiv-
ists fail to mention the near-elimination of extreme poverty since 2002 and in-creased access to doctors and education. 
Also, the price controls that free-market 
enthusiasts complain about allow the poor to access food despite inﬂ  ation.
In addition, they failed to mention 
that the Venezuelan state owns about 5 percent of the media, and nine out of the top-10 newspapers are anti-Chávez. So, claims that the press isn’t free or that Maduro wins elections through propa-
ganda don’t add up.
People oppose the nationalization of 
Venezuelan oil, rent controls and higher 
taxes because those policies beneﬁ  t the oppressed and not one demographic or social class. When nations focus on redistributing wealth through national-izing resources, questions of whether a country is free or democratic arise.
So I am praying for Venezuela. I’m 
praying that the Bolivarian Revolution continues and that neo-liberal poli-cies that only beneﬁ  t a certain class are stopped. I’m praying that, in this coun-try, our government actively ﬁ  ghts against poverty and the oppression of black and brown people.  
I pray that our country stops its im-
perialist policies that destroy the self-determination of nations in the global south and extracts their wealth.

Albert Traversa drove his new, 
light blue Ford C-MAX Hybrid off 
the lot Monday afternoon com-
pletely free of charge.
The 85-year-old Gainesville res-
ident and his wife, Mary Hausler, 
won the car in Ford’s National Gas 
and Go Further Facebook Sweep-
stakes, which was held last year.
“It’s just like winning the lot-to,” Traversa said.
Southern Ford Dealers funded 
the sweepstakes, said spokes-woman Blakeley Ainsworth. The company consists of 93 Ford deal-
erships within Florida, Alabama 
and Georgia. 
Traversa was the first winner to 
come out of the region, she said.
Hausler said her husband en-
tered numerous online contests and sweepstakes before, but this was the first time he won.
“I got a phone call, and I re-
member the person calling said, ‘Are you sitting down?’ I said, ‘Well, I am now,’” she said.
Traversa and Hausler said they 
got to pick from a group of cars. The model they agreed on was the C-MAX Hybrid because it was similar to the Toyota Prius they al-ready owned. 
When asked who picked the 
car color, Traversa said he let his wife make the decision.
“But I like it,” he said.Local couple drives off in free Ford

UF is turning trash into 
treasure for its first repur-
posed fashion competition.
The Repurpose Project, 
a local nonprofit that reuses cast-off resources, and UF’s Office of Sustainability are hosting a fashion competition called Tailored Waste, which will allow students to submit sketches of clothing items made from reusable materials, said Laurel Nesbit, program assistant for the Office of Sus-tainability.
“We are encouraging stu-
dents to be creative and dis-cover new uses for everyday items that usually end up in landfills,” Nesbit said.
The participants can work 
in teams or individually. The materials used in each piece must be reusable, and the clothing items must highlight an area of resource consump-
tion: food, energy, waste or 
transportation. Sketches will 
be accepted until March 9.
Nesbit said her office is 
encouraging students to go to the Repurpose Project to take a look around, rethink what they throw away and get in-spired to sketch.
“A big part of sustainabil-
ity is to get as much life out of the things we are buying and consuming, even if it’s a life that’s different than its origi-nal purpose,” Nesbit said.
The final creation will be re-
vealed on Campus Earth Day on April 11, and the winner of 
the competition will receive a 
gift certificate, she said.    
Mike Myers, the co-found-
er of the Repurpose Project, said his organization will sup-
ply the winner with materials 
to help bring his or her sketch 
to life. He said his organiza-
tion is eager to help the Office of Sustainability with the fash-
ion competition.
“We have wanted to do 
this for a while,” Myers said. 
“We are really happy that the 
Office of Sustainability got 
ahold of us.”
Emily Creahan, a 19-year-
old UF art history sophomore, said she is extremely interest-ed in this competition.
“I think it’s a great way to 
build awareness to be envi-ronmentally friendly,” Crea-han said. “It’s a good way for everyone to get involved.”Students to turn

A UF organization is competing to raise 
donations for food to help the less fortunate.
Campus Kitchens at UF is currently No. 10 
in the Campus Kitchens Project’s annual Raise 
the Dough Challenge, a seven-day competi-
tion in which 20 Campus Kitchens work to 
raise the most money in a week. The branch that raises the most or has the largest number of individual donors will receive $2,500 from the nationwide organization.
“We collect food donations, but oftentimes 
we don’t have enough ingredients for a well-
rounded, nutritious meal,” said Nico Waler, 
the kitchen’s co-president.
The organization uses on-campus kitchens 
in the Reitz Union to collect food donations, cook meals and deliver food to those in need, said the 21-year-old UF biology senior.
Since the competition started Friday, the 
kitchen has raised $235. It hopes to raise $2,500 by the time the competition ends.
Each donor to the UF kitchen’s page has the 
chance to “dare” members of the organization 
as a reward for his or her donation. The dares 
will be documented on the organization’s Fa-cebook page.
Although the organization hasn’t received 
any dares yet, the donors who’ve already giv-en are currently brainstorming their dares.
“It’s a chance to raise money and also have 
a little fun with it,” Waler said. “It’s goofy and harmless, and we do reserve the right to ask for a different dare.”
Andrea Pena, a 19-year-old UF applied 
physiology and kinesiology sophomore, said that as a nutritional sciences minor, she liked the group’s emphasis on donating nutritional meals.
“I don’t have any cash, but if I did, I would 
definitely donate,” said Pena. “I think it’s a re-ally good cause. I’m a big advocate for healthy food.”Campus Kitchens competes for money for nutritious ingredients

Neil Gillespie starts his day 
with a hot cup of coffee, a hard-
boiled egg, fresh oranges and a slice of toast. But if it weren’t for the Gainesville Catholic Worker 
community, he’d likely be hungry 
and left to fend for himself.
The organization, based out of the Green House, located at 213 NW Second Ave., provides food, hospitality and a cozy place to hang out for Gainesville’s home-less. In the last month, it has start-ed providing first aid, haircuts and hot showers to those in need.  
“When we fail to provide the 
dignity that these gentlemen and 
ladies need, we fail them,” said 
22-year-old Alexander Templeton, who’s been working at the house for about a month.
The neat two-story, light green house was purchased in 2004 by local Catholic workers who follow the service-based Catholic Work-ers movement. In the front, the house is surrounded by a white picket fence and lush greenery, and the backyard contains a chick-en coop along with picnic tables and strings of white lights.
To Gillespie, the Green House 
is a second home. He said he’s excited it’s now offering groom-ing and first aid, services that are a luxury to those living on the streets.
For Monday, Tuesday and 
Thursday breakfast, the house staff typically serves between 30 and 40 people. 
Templeton and Daniel Loya, 
a live-in Green House coordina-tor, both want to avoid the “cattle line” approach that many shelters 
and soup kitchens use when serv-
ing.
The house operates on finan-
cial and food donations. Loya said it stays within its means by prac-ticing cost-effective habits like growing a portion of its food and using eggs from the five chickens it keeps in coops out back.
For Templeton and the rest of 
the staff, the house is a way to spread their values and to help the community.
“I want to be a lamp because 
when you have a light that shines inside of you, you don’t put it underneath the table to hide it,” Templeton said. “You allow it to shine to the whole entire world.”

At first glance, chairs don’t look like health 
hazards, but a new study published Wednes-day in the Journal of Physical Activity and 
Health suggests every hour spent sitting dou-bles the risk of disability later in life.
Sedentary lifestyles increase the risk of de-

Dr. Guy Nicolette, associate director of clinical 
services and interim director of the UF Student Health Care Center.
“Exercise can truly be medicine when used 
properly,” Nicolette wrote in an email. “Ul-timately, it is up to the individual to make a choice to exercise or not.”
Kristina Orrego, a 21-year-old UF journal-

Orrego said she spends an average of eight

In a City Commission can-
didate forum Monday night, 
nine out of the 10 commission candidates answered ques-
tions about transportation is-sues and expressed support for 
a public transportation surtax. 
The forum, hosted by the 
Gainesville Citizens for Ac-
tive Transportation and the Gainesville Cycling Club, gave 
each candidate the opportunity 
to answer four questions about 
bicycling issues, street redevel-
opment and the surtax.
Craig Carter, District 3 
Commission candidate, was 
the only one missing from the 
forum. 
One of the questions di-
rected toward the candidates pertained to a Complete Street 
Policy, which was designed to 
enable safe, comfortable travel 
for all road users regardless of 
their modes of transportation.
While all the candidates 
supported the policy, at-large At-Large Seat 2 candidate An-
nie Orlando and District 2 in-
cumbent Todd Chase focused 
on using already existing city 
funds to improve roads. 
“Our challenge is how do 
we take the streets that are already built and improve them,” Chase said.
Additionally, eight of the 
nine present candidates ex-pressed support for a public 
transportation surtax.
The only candidate to ex-
press distaste for the surtax 
was Orlando, who said the tax would add to the already high 
rates residents pay for energy 
and utilities.
Candidates like Sheryl Ed-
die and Cheri Brodeur, both running for the District 2 seat, 
supported the surtax concept but agreed that residential trust 
in the City Commission would have to be rebuilt before any 
new taxes could be imposed.
Other questions focused on 
providing public transporta-
tion for lower-income areas 
like East Gainesville.
Helen Warren, At-Large 
Seat 2 candidate, said she 
thinks these areas need a more dependable method of trans-
portation to shuttle residents 
to and from their workplaces 
as well as to other areas of 
town.
“Transportation is a big bar-
rier for many individuals who 
don’t have money for a car,” 
she said. “That’s where public 
transportation is a method for 
people to rise above their eco-nomic status.”Candidates talk tax,

Bartlett said he will receive about  
$96,000 to continue his research in Germany.
“It will partly be used to facilitate 
some collaborative efforts with Ger-
man scientists,” he said.
The award isn’t the first for Bar-
tlett. He was previously awarded 
the American Chemical Society award for theoretical chemistry.Bartlett’s work allows him to 
travel around the world. Last sum-mer, he was honored at a Quantum Molecular Mechanics congress in Switzerland in front of more than 300 scientists. He said with quantum chemistry, he doesn’t need to get his

No. 1 always has a nice ring to it.
But the Gators, the newly appointed kings of the As-
sociated Press poll, have rung a constant tune all season: 
Rankings mean nothing.
“On any given night, in between the lines, there’s a 
lot of teams that can be No. 1 in the country,” coach Billy 
Donovan said. “On any given night, anybody could play 
to that level. 
“It’s not like all of a sudden Florida is No. 1 or you get 
a ranking and we’re the best team in the country. We’ve been given a number, and that’s about the extent of it.”
The Gators (25-2, 14-0 Southeastern Conference) re-
ceived 47 of 65 first-place votes in Monday’s AP poll. Un-defeated Wichita State moved up to No. 2, with Arizona, Syracuse and Kansas rounding out the top five.
Florida had not been No. 1 in the AP poll since the 
week of Feb. 12, 2007 — a time when Corey Brewer, Al Horford and Joakim Noah were battling to win their sec-ond consecutive national title. 
“It’s an honor — I’m not dismissing that,” Donovan 
said. “But I think what happens is sometimes you can get focused on that and what happens is now everything that you do is attached to a ranking. No. 1 Florida — if we stay No. 1. … You never hear like No. 2 Florida. It’s No. 1. It’s 
that ranking that gets dragged with your team.”
Donovan, never an advocate of rankings or polls, said 
the only reason why UF garnered a No. 1 ranking Mon-
day is because the teams previously above it have lost.
“Any time you do what Syracuse did and you’ve won 
out 25 games in a row, you kind of do what Arizona did before they had Brandon Ashley’s injury, you do what

Thirty-six straight holes did not 
faze the No. 16 Gators on Monday. 
Instead, the team had its best over-
all performance of the year during the 
first two rounds of the 2014 Allstate Sugar Bowl Intercollegiate Champi-onship with a score of 572 (-4).
Rain early Sunday morning pushed 
the first round of the tournament to Monday morning, forcing Florida to play two rounds instead of one on the same day.The Gators responded to the long 
day of competition with a strong 
third-place finish, trailing No. 1 USC 
by six strokes and No. 2 UCLA by ten strokes.

Prior to the Lipton Invitational, junior Bri-
ana Little did not have a start in 2014. Like-
wise, freshman Chelsea Herndon logged only 
one start through Florida’s first 12 contests.
But that has not stopped the two from be-
ing valuable hard-hitters at the plate in their 
few opportunities early this season. 
Heading into the tournament at Katie Sea-
shole Pressly Stadium, the duo combined for five RBIs and a .400 clip at the plate.
“They gave us something off the bench,” 
coach Tim Walton said. “We’ve had one per-son off the bench in almost every year that I’ve been here, but to have two or three weap-ons to come off the bench to swing the bat the way they’re swinging, I was very pleased.” 
Little took full advantage of her first start 
of the year. 
The Middleburg native opened up the 
scoring in Florida’s 8-0 five-inning win against Indiana on Saturday with a two-run homer — the 13th of her career. Through the four games the Gators played in the Lipton 
Invitational, Little logged two hits in four at-
bats and drove in three runs.
Herndon’s success as a 
pinch-hitter was apparent 
from the start of the sea-son. Through Florida’s first 12 games, Herndon was 3 for 6 at the plate and hit a 
two-run home run to cen-
ter field against then-No.22 Minnesota.
While the freshman 
outfielder was not as successful at the plate 
during Florida’s lone home tournament of 
the season — logging only one hit and strik-ing out twice in seven at-bats — Walton was impressed with Herndon’s defensive perfor-mance.Bench contributing for No. 1 UF

� HE PITCHED THREE INNINGS SUNDAY.
ADAM PINCUS
Alligator Staff Writer @adamDpincus
CORAL GABLES — Karsten Whitson arrived 
at Florida as the crown jewel of Kevin O’Sullivan’s 
recruiting class four years ago. The 225-pound right-hander had the golden arm and the tree-trunk legs to match it. In basketball terms, he was 
a slam dunk.
But things have gone downhill since. Whitson’s 
labrum and rotator cuff started rubbing together, 
his father, Kent Whitson, said in an interview with Baseball America. The pain dated back to the lat-ter part of his freshman season. After a thorough process, Whitson elected to have season-ending shoulder surgery in February 2013, which ended his junior campaign before it could start. 
His draft stock reached its lowest — the Nation-
als selected Whitson in the 37th-round in June 2013 — and questions rose again as to how he could say no to a $2.1 million payday. 
Whitson’s long road to recovery made its latest 
stop when he threw 54 pitches over three innings in his second start of this season on Sunday against No. 14 Miami. 
“I think every time he goes out there, he’s go-
ing to learn something new,” O’Sullivan said. “To expect him to come out and throw seven shutout innings in his second start after missing two years is unrealistic.”
Whitson appeared hesitant at times, throwing 
his plus-slider that used to buckle hitters’ knees and make their bats obsolete. His fastball touched 92 mph but consistently remained at 87-88 mph.  
“I’ve been working awfully hard just getting 
the right arm slot and getting the right grip on [the slider],” Whitson said. “Once I actually get a few going there, I think I’ll be, ‘Oh hey there it is.’ It’s 
all about getting comfortable and getting out there 
a little more.”
As the San Diego Padres’ first pick in the 2010 
draft, Whitson was selected as a top-of-the-rotation guy — the kind MLB teams build their rotations around. Players selected in that same first round include All-Stars Bryce Harper, Manny Machado, Matt Harvey and Chris Sale.
He chose to fulfill his other 
childhood dream to play for Florida — the same school both 
of his parents graduated from. A 
freshman All-American season 
gave way to an injury-plagued sophomore year where he pitched through arm issues. 
Whitson admittedly felt 
more comfortable Sunday than 
his two-inning start against Maryland on Feb. 16, which ended in an 8-5 Florida win. 
Thirty of his 54 pitches on Sunday were strikes. 
He went to four three-ball counts in the first inning and three two-ball counts in the second. It wasn’t his best, but it was a start.
“The real thing that factored in early in the 
game with [Whitson] is we had so much pitching left,” O’Sullivan said. “We just didn’t want to leave here without using our depth.”
Whitson has had an unexpected ride through 
four seasons at UF. It was a coup to have him sign. It would be an even bigger story to see him become the dominant power pitcher he was four years ago.
He took another step toward that Sunday. Mi-
ami junior left-hander Andrew Suarez, the oppos-ing starter, underwent shoulder surgery in 2012. Suarez, the Toronto Blue Jays’ ninth-round pick out of high school, lost fastball velocity a year later 
in his first season following the procedure.
After allowing four first-inning runs on six hits 
to UF, Suarez scattered five hits over the next six 
innings. As Suarez showed, recovery takes time and pays off. Whitson may not be breaking the ra-dar gun, but he’s working his way back.
“I feel good right now. Whatever [my velocity 
is] it is. I’m just going out there and [trying] to win a ballgame,” Whitson said. 
“It’s nothing I’m worried about when I’m out 
there. I’m definitely fine with it.”Whitson slowly progressing

“The girls played well to-
day and I am proud of them,” 
coach Emily Glaser said in 
a release. “We let a few get away at the end. It seemed to be a bit of fatigue because it 
was a tough day.”
Freshman Maria Torres 
shot seven birdies during 
the two rounds of competi-tion, tying for sixth place af-
ter matching a career-best 70 
during the second round. 
Torres is tied with two 
other players in sixth place 
with a score of 141 (-3). 
Karolina Vlckova led the 
four other individual play-
ers after ending the day of competition at even par. The 
freshman tied for 18th overall 
with six other players, includ-ing teammate junior Sarah Schober, with a score of 144 
and a team-high nine birdies.  
Schober canceled out seven birdies with seven bogeys, 
while Vlckova struggled to 
overcome shooting double bogeys in each round.
Junior Camilla Hedberg 
and senior Elcin Ulu, the only 
members on the Gators who 
previously played in New Orleans, finished the day tied with each other and six other players for 24th place with a score of 145 (+1). Both Ulu and Hedberg shot three bird-
ies in the first round, but Ulu 
shot two consecutive double bogeys early in the second round while Hedberg shot 
four bogeys.
Redshirt sophomore Ka-
tie Mitchell, the only player 
to make the lineup in every tournament of the 2013-14 
season rounded out the Flor-
ida lineup with a score of 146 (+2).
The Gators look to clinch 
their third-straight top-10 finish in New Orleans today during the final round of the 
tournament. The team placed 
10th in both 2012 and 2013.
“The team did a great 
job of managing their way 
around this course and it 
was a real team effort today,” Glaser said. “We are looking forward to being in the last group [Tuesday].”golf , from page 13Torres shoots career-best 
round, notches seven 
birdies at tournament Wichita State is doing. Those are 
really, really impressive things, what they’re doing on the court 
in my opinion,” Donovan said. 
“A lot of times it has nothing 
to do with about what you do. It 
has to do with what other people 
do. 
“When you start to be affected 
by what happens to other people, you get focused on the wrong 
things and your focus gets a lot broader where you really need to narrow your focus this year in terms of what we do need to 
do.”
During UF’s repeat season, 
it was No. 1 in the polls for five consecutive weeks during its SEC 
slate until getting upset by Van-
derbilt in Nashville, Tenn., on 
Feb. 17, 2007. 
Ironically, the No. 1 Gators’ 
next game will take place in Me-morial Gym against the Commo-dores tonight at 7. 
Florida will look to win its 
20th straight and clinch at least a 
share of the SEC title when both 
teams square off.
But the Gators know winning 
in Nashville is no easy task.
“We know we’re in this posi-
tion,” Will Yeguete said. 
“We know that teams are go-
ing to probably give us their best shots. It’s obviously something 
that we need to respond and try 
to keep calm as well. 
“Whether we’re No. 1, I think 
every team wants to beat us, es-
pecially because we’re undefeat-
ed in the SEC. So we just got to take one game at a time and just be able to be ready from the get-go and not let them get on a run early.”
Hill still doubtful: Point guard 
Kasey Hill (groin) looks doubtful for No. 1 Florida’s matchup at Vanderbilt (15-11, 7-7 SEC) to-night but will be a game-time de-
cision, Donovan said Monday. 
Hill is progressing, but Dono-
van fears the freshman may re-
aggravate his injury if he returns too soon. 
Since suffering the injury at 
Kentucky on Feb. 15, Hill has missed UF’s past two games.
During the combined seven 
minutes Scottie Wilbekin rested in UF’s two contests last week, the Gators had forward Dorian Finney-Smith, guard Michael 
Frazier II and swingman DeVon 
Walker alternate backup point guard duties and make up for Hill’s absence.
Hill averaged 5.6 points and 
3.1 assists in 21 games before suf-fering his groin injury.TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 25, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15

Kirsti Merritt bats against Florida’s 6-0 win against Jacksonville on Wednesday at Katie Seashole 
Pressly Stadium. Merritt knocked a pinch-hit home run against Indiana on Saturday.Merritt pinch-hits home run
“I’m not really worried about ei-
ther of them defensively,” the ninth-
year coach said. “I think Chelsea’s still 
learning the position more than Bri-ana. She’s super athletic. She’s going go all out and try and do what she can 
to catch the ball.”
Kirsti Merritt also succeeded off the 
bench for Florida. For the first time this 
season, Walton did not pencil her into the starting lineup, but Merritt made 
the most of her one at-bat. 
In the fifth inning, the sophomore 
hit her first home run of the season 
to drive in three runs and power the Gators to their fifth run-rule game of 
the season. 
“We’ve been very productive, hit-
ting the ball hard, getting on base, 
finding ways to score,” Walton said.
Fuller improving in sophomore 
year: Coming out of high school, util-ity player Taylore Fuller was one of Walton’s top recruits.
During her senior year at Chiefland 
High in Trenton, the No. 6 catcher and No. 38 overall prospect on ESPNHS’s 100 list posted a .778 batting average, a 1.944 slugging percentage and 14 home runs.
Even though those numbers didn’t 
transition to her first year in college — Fuller had a .212 clip in her 113 at-bats in 2013 and had only four hits leave the park — Walton still sees Fuller’s 
potential.
“She’s going to be good. We just 
have to be a little bit more patient and 
probably than she thought,” Walton 
said. 
“You know, when you hit that 
many home runs and have that kind 
of batting average in high school, you have to manage the expectations a lit-
tle bit, but she’s doing well.”
This season, Fuller’s composure at 
the plate has improved. The sopho-
more has three home runs through her first 14 games, leads Florida with an 
on-base percentage of .636 and is tied 
for sixth in the Southeastern Confer-ence after being walked 12 times.
“Her progress is going good,” Wal-
ton said. 
“She’s getting a better understand-
ing of what her swing does and how her swing breaks down and what we have to do to improve her swing. Love 
the kid. The kid brings it. She’s a hard Soft , from page 13

 There are no problems with UF’s 
perfect record so far this season, the 
six perfect 10s the team has scored or even the health of the team, b  ut 
there are few things Rhonda Faehn 
would like to change about her 2014 
gymnastics squad. 
  Against then-No. 3 LSU on Fri-
day, then-No. 2 Florida (7-0, 5-0 Southeastern Conference) posted its best balance beam score (49.550), best vault (49.525) and best overall total (198.125) of the season. 
  Faehn’s squad shattered Florida’s 
previous record of three 10s in a sea-son set in 1998, and there might be more 10s to come from UF this year. 
  Junior Kytra Hunter has contrib-
uted four of Florida’s six 10s, and UF has claimed six of the nation’s 11 perfect 10s in NCAA gymnastics so far this year.
  “Again, it was an incredible 
night, Kytra [Hunter] with a 10.0,” said Bridget Sloan, who owns UF’s two other 10s. “I mean, that girl is on ﬁ  re.” 
  Alaina Johnson, who has com-
peted all-around for the Gators in the past three meets, scored a 39.65 in all-around against LSU on Friday. Her 2014 season best was just shy of her all-around career best (39.675). 
  “It was really promising and it 
gave her a conﬁ  dence boost to have this great competition last week,” Faehn said. “That was really excep-tional on all four events for her and she’s capable of doing that every single time.” 
  After taking a yearlong break 
from competing all-around, the 
senior has showed consistent im-
provement in competition scores week-to-week. Friday, she placed third on all-around, ﬂ  oor (9.925) and uneven bars (9.925). 
 “P hysically, she’s probably feel-
ing the best she’s felt in a while, so that’s exciting, and it’s always posi-tive,” Faehn said.
    Still, there are two areas — un-
even bars and landings — in which Faehn would like to see Florida im-prove before it faces Alabama on the road this week.
  “Our athletes know that they 
just really have to stay focused on what they can control,” Faehn said. 
“We’ll be starting on bars and so the 
key will be to start out strong and aggressive on bars and then just to carry that momentum through for the rest of the competition.” 
  With most of the Gators scoring 
in at least the 9.90 range, the small-est mistake, such as a misstep on a landing, could make the difference 
between a perfect 10 and a 9.95. 
  “Our goal from the start was to 
start out slower and then to gradual-
ly try and get more landings,” Faehn said. “Last week, we included a few more drills for landings, and this week, we’re going to ramp that up even just a little bit more.”

TRACK AND FIELD
  LAWRENCE LAGUNA
 Alligator Writer @LagunaLawrence
  With about 400 meters to go in 
the ﬁ  nal leg of the men’s 5,000-me-
ter race, Mark Parrish knew he was capable of ﬁ  nishing his run on time. 
  Pulling on the outside of the 
Dempsey Indoor track in Seattle, Parrish moved into position to kick and get out in front of a herd of runners ahead of him.
  Grasping onto a lead and boot-
ing his way to the end of the race, Parrish was abruptly clipped from behind by a competitor, which was 
enough to drain the power from 
his legs and disrupt his rhythm. 
  However, Parrish managed to cross the ﬁ  nish line and come in ﬁ  fth place with a time of 13:43.15. When he looked back and saw his time displayed on the clock, he re-alized he had shattered a 20-year-old UF record by 16 seconds. 
  The new record holder in the 
5,000m said he had a feeling this was coming. He also knew what 
the record was before going into 
the race.
  In fact, he has known for a cou-
ple of years. 
  “It’s really nice to get on a track 
record, because I already had the cross country record,” Parrish said. “But track, it’s pretty much you’re the best if you have broken 
that record.   “Just getting a record like that, 
I’m really proud to be able to say 
that our years that I was here had some really good Gator athletes who were pushing the boundar-ies, going where the program has never gone before in terms of dis-tance, so I’m really proud to be a part of that.”
  The lanky 6-foot, 135-pound se-
nior has been preparing his entire tenure at UF to pull off the record-breaking performance during the track season.
  Coach Mike Holloway and as-
sistant coach Paul Spangler talked about their predictions for Par-rish’s run, but neither thought he 
would break the record.  “The biggest performance of 
the weekend was Mark Parrish,” 
Holloway said. “I don’t know how you ever discount that per-formance. That was a great job by him and coach Spangler.
  “Mark has big goals and big 
dreams, but I know coach Span-gler thought he was going to run 
fast but quite not that fast.”
  The Tampa native will try to 
end his UF indoor career on a high 
note when the Gators compete at the Southeastern Conference In-door Championships on Thurs-day.
  When the Gators head back to 
College Station, Texas, to compete 
this time for the SEC title, Parrish will run in the 5,000m, 3,000-meter 
and the steeplechase. 
  After breaking the school re-
cord in the 5K, the senior’s pref-erence is to run the 3K, which he believes he is better at.
  “The event 
that I’m really going to be look-
ing at to run fast 
in is going to be the 3k,” Parrish said. 
“Quite a few 
people in that race would run 
faster than me. I think that with the ﬁ  tness level in that, I can prob-
ably run as fast as they can.”
