Independent candidate for Hume area and UF civil engineering freshman Preston Jones, 18, is congratulated 
by Swamp Party President Ricky Salabarria after winning the Senate seat Wednesday night.

All but one seat in the UF 
Student Senate will be repre-
sented by the Swamp Party.
While the unopposed 
Swamp Party swept up 49 seats in the Fall 2014 Student Government elections, inde-pendent candidate Preston Jones defeated Swamp Party 
candidate Rachel Laky for 
the sole Hume area seat with 61.2 percent of the vote. Jones pulled in 175 votes, and Laky 
raked in 108.
A fatigued Jones, sunburnt 
from campaigning outside 
Hume Hall, was relieved.
“I’m so thankful to the 
people of Hume and students of Hume who chose me as their senator,” the 18-year-old UF civil engineering fresh-man said. “I am so excited to be able to work to make the 
Hume area a better place.”Although defeated, Laky 
may campaign again.
“Of course I’m disappoint-
ed, but of course no regrets at all,” the accounting freshman 
said.
UF Supervisor of Elections 
Hans Rojas released the results 
Tuesday night without much 
fanfare; instead of a grand an-nouncement on a stage out-side of the Reitz Union like past elections, Rojas decided 
to hand out paper copies of 
the results on the third ﬂ  oor of the Reitz Union at 9:30 p.m. to save money.
These elections saw the low-
est turnout in recent history of 6,733 ballots, with 2,052 of those ballots cast on Wednes-day. Spring 2014’s election 
yielded 7,919 ballots, which 
fell behind Fall 2013’s turnout of 8,766 ballots, according to Alligator archives.

� IT LOST ITS LAWSUIT WITH NINE 
RECORD LABELS.

In a scathing ruling issued this week, 
Grooveshark lost a three-year legal battle for 
blatantly and consciously infringing on copy-rights of nine major record labels. 
A federal judge ruled that the two found-
ers of the Gainesville-based music streaming website and its employees violated the copy-rights of about 6,000 songs from record labels including Sony Music Entertainment, Warner Bros. Records and Atlantic Recording Corpo-ration. 
Grooveshark, which streams virtually any 
song in the world thanks to uploads from us-ers, came into existence because of a loophole in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, exempting websites from responsibility for copyrighted content uploaded by users. 
The loophole was legal as long as Groove-
shark agreed to take down copyrighted ma-terial each time record labels formally com-plained.
But in an attempt to build the website’s 
momentum in its early days of inception, circa 2006, Grooveshark violated this agreement.
Instead, the two founders, Samuel Taran-
tino and Joshua Greenberg, started uploading songs personally, avoiding record company approval and licenses.
According to the ruling, the founders ac-
knowledged that their business plan was to exploit the record companies’ content to grow their own business, then “beg forgiveness” and seek licensing agreements.
Tarantino and Greenberg not only upload-
ed their own content, but also urged employ-ees to do the same.Music-streaming website

America’s third-worst small-town 
speed trap disbanded its police de-
partment Wednesday.
The disbandment of Waldo’s po-
lice force comes after an investigation launched last month addressed claims 
its ofﬁ  cers were under a strict ticket-
writing quota, which is illegal.
Waldo’s City Council voted for the 
disbandment Tuesday, and it went into effect at midnight.
The Alachua County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce 
will now handle all the city’s law en-forcement services through a contract both Sheriff Sadie Darnell and the city 
of Waldo agreed to.
The disbandment left seven ofﬁ  cers 
– who are on paid administrative leave 
until Oct. 31 – without a job, a release said.
When the ticket quota investigation 
began at the beginning of September, Waldo’s chief of police and the interim chief of police resigned. The ﬁ  ve re-maining ofﬁ  cers brought forth infor-mation regarding the potential ticket 
quota, acting captain Steve Maynard 
said.
Maynard, whose contract expires 
Friday at 5 p.m., has been the interim 
police chief for the past 30 days. Be-
cause Maynard works for Alachua County, he said he has arrest powers in Waldo. But as soon as he steps over county lines, he is considered a civil-
ian.
“I can still arrest, write tickets and 
the whole nine yards within that coun-
ty line,” he said.
Though a ticket quota is illegal, City Council votes to disband

Hacky Sacking

UF Health and UF launched a 
new system for faculty and staff 
Wednesday that will offer online professional training.
The myTraining portal system, 
developed by Gainesville company SumTotal Systems aims to provide management of training records, training schedules, registration for professional and required classes as well as online training to both sets of employee groups.
The myTraining program costs 
$200,000 a year, something Greg Hollingshead, director of human 
resource development at UF Health 
Shands Hospital, said is worth the investment.
“I know that sounds like a very 
large number,” he said. “But, when you consider the audiences we serve, that’s a very large number as well.”
The two groups entered into an 
agreement with SumTotal Systems 
in January. The idea for a training program beneﬁ  ting faculty and staff 
of UF and Shands began a year ago.
Jodi Gentry, assistant vice presi-
dent for human resource services at 
UF, said the myTraining portal was 
an opportunity for the two groups to improve the way they offered training services to their respective employees.
“We were frequently asking fac-
ulty to complete training sponsored by UF or by UF Health Shands,” she said. “We saw it as an opportunity 
to share resources and improve our overall delivery of training.”
Before the program, it was not 
uncommon for either group to send 
employees to various locations to re-
ceive professional training.
The new system will streamline 
access to both employee groups 
and provide easier access for new employees to access job training im-mediately.
University faculty are employed 
by UF, while employees working in the hospital are employed by UF 
Health.Hollingshead said before the 
adoption of the new system, it was 
difﬁ  cult for the university and UF Health to manage the training of 
university faculty along with hospi-
tal staff.
“We have two employee groups 
that we’re including that we haven’t had to manage before,” he said. “The program will make it much more simple and reliable for us.”

� THE IFAS STUDY REFUTES 
OLD LEGISLATION.
KELSIE OZANNE
Alligator Contributing Writer
A new UF study suggests geo-
graphically isolated wetlands de-
serve protection too — a ﬁ  nding 
that conﬂ  icts with previous Su-
preme Court decisions regarding wetland conservation. 
The Institute of Food and Ag-
ricultural Sciences study found that even though these areas ap-pear to be isolated, they are sig-niﬁ  cantly connected to the state’s waterways system.
The ﬁ  ndings dispute 2001 and 
2006 Supreme Court legislation, which suggested geographically isolated wetlands are not a con-
servation priority. These deci-
sions trickled down into the En-vironmental Protection Agency’s wetland conservation test where it determined which wetlands 
would be conserved under the Clean Water Act.
The agency funded the 
$160,000 study.
Wetlands make groundwater 
more constant and keep stream 
ﬂ  ows from varying. But without  these isolated wetlands, larger 
bodies of water are at a greater 
risk of drying out and harming wildlife, said Matthew Cohen, a UF associate professor in ecohy-
drology and a study researcher.
It’s not big wetlands like 
Payne’s Prairie Preserve State 
Park that are in danger of los-ing protection, Cohen said, but 
smaller ones. Alachua County 
has thousands of these small, iso-lated wetlands that directly affect Florida’s water systems.
“They have been ditched and 
drained and otherwise degrad-ed,” he said. 
Bonnie Morris, 20, said she 
sees the effects on mistreated wa-
terways in her classes.
“We learned that all the 
streams are connected,” the UF forest research and conservation 
junior said. “If water is polluted, 
it’s going to affect all of them in 
some way. We should deﬁ  nitely be protecting that.”
The Florida Department of En-
vironmental Protection is work-
ing to maintain the quality and 
quantity of water throughout the state, said Jim Lumar, an agency spokesman.
“We have a signiﬁ  cant focus 
on springs throughout the state,” he said.
The agency recently received 
a $69 million boost to enhance 
the water quality of Florida’s 
springs. The Ichetucknee, Santa Fe and Suwannee rivers will be included in the project.
However, Cohen believes the 
same protection should apply to the smaller waterways feeding into them. 
“We shouldn’t draw the line 
in such a way that we lose wet-lands that are providing valuable services,” he said.Food sciences institute study ﬁ  nds 
isolated wetlands worth conservingCAMPUSvoter turnout and the elec-
tions overall,” Rojas said.
Swamp Party stole the 
Spring 2014 elections, win-ning both the executive ticket and all 50 Senate seats based on classification and college 
major.
“We’re really appreciative 
of the students who voted 
and put in their input,” said Swamp Party spokeswoman 
Katie Backstrand. “We’re 
looking forward to work on our platform goals.”
The Swamp Party also 
dominated all seven of Dis-trict B’s seats, where inde-pendent candidate Evan Morris campaigned.
The seven winners each 
had vote totals ranging from 673 to 636, while 134 votes — 2.7 percent — were tallied for Morris. 
Even though Morris lost, 
he said he was happy an in-
dependent candidate won at 
least one seat.
“I think it opened my eyes 
to how the politics on this 
campus work,” the 20-year-
old UF marketing junior said.  “I definitely want to encourage other students to challenge the system that 
they see around them.”
While no registered candi-
date campaigned for District 
E, which represents students 
living outside of Alachua 
County, 11 write-in ballots were cast for the Swamp Par-ty, and therefore the party won the seat, Rojas said. 
The UF Elections Com-
mission will determine the next steps for District E, Ro-jas said.Maynard said the tickets 
Waldo police officers wrote were valid.
“People are getting upset 
and saying it’s a speed trap, but the speed trap can’t be blamed on speed limits,” he 
said. “That isn’t in their au-
thority.”
The Department of Trans-
portation is responsible for 
the sudden change in speeds between Gainesville and Jacksonville, Maynard said, which can shift anywhere 
from 65 mph to 55 mph to 45 
mph and back again along U.S. Highway 301.
“It’s my job to enforce the 
law that is posted,” Maynard said. “The issue of a quota is a separate matter altogeth-
er.”Small-town police de-
partments generate funding 
through civil fine revenue. Larger police departments – 
like Gainesville Police – are 
funded through taxes.
“The reality of it is with-
out civil fine revenue, small-
town police departments 
will cease to exist.” Maynard said. “More than anything, it really is a funding issue. The officers knew if they didn’t 
write the tickets, they don’t 
have a job.”
But ticket quotas are un-
ethical, Maynard said.
“Quotas have long since 
been frowned upon,” he said. “That is clearly wrong and unethical, if not illegal.”
The ticket quota investi-
gation is ongoing.4, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, OCTOBER 2, 2014

Vegans don’t have to scavenge 
for food anymore now that UF’s 
Gator Dining Services is expanding its vegan options.
Peta2, the world’s largest youth 
animal rights group, is bringing a vegan-friendly menu to campus.
Christina Bicknell, a peta2 cam-
pus representative, gave away free Tofurky sandwiches, granola bars and chips on the Plaza of the Ameri-cas on Wednesday from 2 to 4 p.m. to raise awareness about the new vegan options available on campus.
“Our campaign for more vegan 
food to be brought to the UF campus was driven by the strong demand for it,” Bicknell said.
Bicknell said 20 new vegan foods 
were added to the P.O.D. Markets last week, and they’re moving off the shelves quickly. Some of the items include Tofurky, cheese, hot cereal cups, macaroni and cheese, 
tempeh, vegetable chips and energy 
bars.
“We are just really excited these options were brought to campus and that Gator Dining was willing 
to make changes,” Bicknell said.
UF finance junior Karli Astaphan 
said it’s great these foods were add-
ed because it’s hard to find vegan options at most on-campus dining locations.
“I think this will let vegan stu-
dents have a much easier time find-ing healthy options that fit their spe-cialized diet,” said Astaphan, 20.
Beverly Wharton, a UF mechani-
cal engineering junior, said these small changes could lead to changes in people’s lives and perceptions of vegan food.
“Hopefully it will help others 
open their eyes that there are more choices and that they can be deli-cious, not scary like most people think vegan food is,” Wharton, 20, said.

Court said it broke copyright laws
In a company-wide forum post 
in 2007, Greenberg told employees 
to “please share as much music as possible from outside the office, and leave your computers on whenever 
you can. This initial content is what 
will get our network started — it’s very important that we all help out!”
The post continued with Green-
berg encouraging employees to download as many MP3 files as pos-sible and upload them to Groove-shark’s shared files, building a 
library of illegal songs to help the 
company gain traction.
“There is no reason why ANY-
ONE in the company should not be able to do this,” the post said, “and I expect everyone to have this done by Monday… IF I DON’T HAVE AN EMAIL FROM YOU IN MY IN-BOX BY MONDAY, YOU’RE ON 
MY OFFICIAL S**T LIST.”
A handful of employees testified 
to the encouragement, according to 
court documents.
By 2008, as the company neared 
the release of its current operat-ing system, Grooveshark Lite, em-ployees were again told to upload content to the site’s Central Music Library to reach the 2-million-song benchmark. 
The next year, numerous notifica-
tions from record companies started flooding the site, asking for content to be taken down. 
If Grooveshark complied with 
the complaints, users were then free to legally reupload and replace the removed content.
According to the ruling, Groove-
shark employees personally upload-ed songs again. 
A UserFiles table kept by the 
site contained proof of more than 150,000 Grooveshark employee-uploaded files, including thousands of recordings owned by the record companies in the suit.
Grooveshark also destroyed evi-
dence of Greenberg’s personal up-loads, records of 320,000 employee uploads and source code files.
All in all, copies of copyrighted 
songs belonging to the nine record companies were streamed at least 36 million times. 
Users of the service and past and 
future employees will not be held li-able for songs uploaded.
Grooveshark declined to com-
ment on the ruling. Both sides have 18 days to propose damages.
In July, problems within the com-
pany were the subject of an anony-mous post by a Grooveshark em-ployee on Pastebin, an application that stores plain text. The post cited multiple layoffs and allegations of false reviews.
“It’s bad. Really, really bad,” the 
post read. “I’m working here until I can find a decent job somewhere 
else where I won’t have to sell my 
soul anymore.”
Breana Auberry, president and 
co-founder of Swamp Records, which announced a partnership with Grooveshark last month, said the ruling won’t affect the student-run record label.
“We aren’t in streaming nor a 
major record label, so this doesn’t af-fect us at all,” Auberry said. 
“We are a nonprofit, student-run 
record label that was offered sup-port by some amazing Gator alum-ni,” she added.
According to Grooveshark’s 
website, more than 30 million users shared more than 15 million files.

Burnise Watson’s car flipped and burst into flames Tuesday night after she collided with Erin Domaracki. 
Neither was issued a citation due to conflicting accounts.
SHANNON KAESTLE
Alligator Contributing Writer
Flames shot into the sky Tues-
day night as Burnise Watson 
watched her car burn.
Watson collided with Erin Do-
maracki’s car at 11:16 p.m. on her way home from work at Merricks Group Home.
Watson’s Toyota SUV flipped 
onto its side at the intersection of Southwest 13th Street and South-west 16th Avenue and immedi-ately burst into flames — with 
her and her 1-year-old grand-
daughter inside, she said.
That’s when Dequavius Wig-
gins started to run.
Wiggins, 21, is an employee at 
Steak ‘n Shake and a transfer stu-dent at Santa Fe College. He said he and another Steak ‘n Shake employee helped Watson and her granddaughter, Ziyari Smith, out of the car. He said it was instinct.
“I just reacted,” he said. “The 
car could have blown up. I could 
have blown up with it.”
Domaracki said her head, 
chest, left arm, knees and abdo-
men hurt, but she was not trans-ported to a hospital, according to 
the GPD accident report.
 Watson said she and Ziyari

October marks Domestic Vio-
lence Awareness Month, and 
Gainesville Police is joining other law enforcement agencies and lo-cal businesses in recognition.
From the Ray Rice debate to 
the tragic murder-suicide in Bell, 
Florida, domestic violence cases 
have made national headlines. 
Just this year, GPD responded 
to 407 non-criminal domestic disturbances, and a release said officers arrested 778 people on domestic violence charges with 
proof of a threat or injury.
This month, Satchel’s Pizza is donating its ATM fees to Peace-ful Paths, a 24-hour crisis line and 
emergency shelter that serves do-mestic violence victims in Alach-ua, Bradford and Union counties.
GPD identifies high-risk do-
mestic violence cases through its Lethality Assessment Protocol, a checklist used to determine the severity of a specific case. 
Some of the checklist’s ques-
tions require an officer to contact 
a domestic violence counselor 
while on the scene.
GPD spokesman Officer Ben 
Tobias said it is up to the offend-ers to stop domestic violence.
“Domestic abusers think it’s 
simply a loss of control that cre-
ates violent behavior,” Tobias said 
in a press release. “In fact, abusive domestic behavior is a deliberate choice to gain control over their partner.”Locals advocate against

A UF study has found that Florida’s warm tem-
peratures and wet landscape raise soil’s ability to 
store carbon and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
The study’s results were in the September issue 
of the Science of the Total Environment journal.
Sabine Grunwald, a UF Institute of Food and 
Agricultural Sciences soil and water science profes-
sor, led the study. She was motivated to understand 
how the carbon cycle works with climate and what effect it had on soil’s carbon storage.
Researchers used 45 years of data to find the 
state’s climate and agricultural production are im-
proving because the soil is storing the buildup of 
carbon-based gases in the atmosphere, she said.
“Many people look at soil and think ‘we don’t 
care,’ and actually everyone should care,” Grun-
wald said. “This is our livelihood. We could not ex-
ist without healthy and good soil, and usually that 
means carbon-good soil.”Florida soil has the highest carbon storage, she 
said. The more water there is in the soil, the more 
likely it is to store carbon. This impacts food pro-
duction and clean drinking water.
Carbon dioxide is naturally found in the atmo-
sphere, but too much can be produced, creating a 
shield that traps the energy within the atmosphere, causing the global warming effect. The soil acts as a container of the gas, which reduces the amount of 
gas that goes into the atmosphere, she said.
“If the soil is helping to slow down global warm-
ing, I’m all for it,” said Denise Robinson, a 21-year-
old UF journalism senior.
In the three-year study, researchers looked over 
data from 1,251 soil samples collected across Flori-
da from 1965 to 1996, according to a UF/IFAS press 
release.
Grunwald plans to make a carbon storage as-
sessment across the U.S. She will look for ways 
that government agencies can make wise decisions 
about how to maintain landscapes.
Grunwald said by publicizing her data she will 
be able to expand her soil-carbon research.  
“We will gain some visibility by promoting 
these programs and making this data available,” she said.Soil may slow down climate change

After four years, UF’s Office of Sustainability plans to reig-
nite a former green campaign.
The 2010 energy efficiency campaign, Chomp Down on En-
ergy, has dwindled in student and faculty awareness, but the 
Office of Sustainability is working on revamping it.
Chomp Down on Energy was a campus-wide effort to pro-
mote sustainability and energy conservation.
Allison Vitt, the outreach and communications coordinator 
at the UF Office of Sustainability, said the campaign is no lon-ger being actively promoted.
“They sort of have a life cycle, and when you get it out there, 
its new and its fresh, and people are receptive to that message, and you give them an actionable item — something they can do,” she said.
The campaign kicked off green teams, or self-directed 
groups designated on campus, that would implement and en-force conservation measures within their areas.
UF’s Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology and Re-
search has kept its green team since the campaign’s inception.
The center’s green team, which also incorporates other de-
partments in the Cancer and Genetics Research Complex, has taken measures to reduce its environmental footprint by act-ing as the leader in sustainable practices in its area, said Megan Kimmel, the communications director of the Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology and Research.
“We get lots of shipments. We get lots of boxes and Styro-
foam and cooler packs from people sending us samples,” Kim-mel said. “So in ICBR, we have made it a habit to recycle all of those things or to repurpose all of those things.”
The ICBR green team has also taken measures to extend 
its environmentally conscious mindset to other places around campus. For example, the team does annual swamp cleanups in which they head to Lake Alice and remove trash.
Plans to revamp the Chomp Down on Energy campaign 
by the Office of Sustainability include redevelopment of the campaign’s office certification program. The program requires individuals to self-assess their areas on campus and find out what they can improve upon.
“Once they got through this process, they would become a 
green-certified office,” Vitt said. “So then, it would just be sort of one area of pride for them to be able to promote about them-selves.”Sustainability campaign to be revamped after four year decline“The car could have

around creep Sam Pepper decided it would be re-ally funny to “prank” women by sexually assaulting 
and harassing them and recording it on video.
Violation and harassment of women is wrong and dis-
gusting, even when it’s done as a prank. In fact, it’s almost more horrifying to me that someone would think “prank” sexual harassment is even remotely OK.
Disrespecting other people’s bodies is not an accept-
able “social experiment” or an attempt at a harmless joke. The fact that some people in today’s society tolerate such a horrible act makes me sick. Pepper’s actions promote the 
idea that such despicable behavior is a normal way to in-
teract with others. Luckily, most of the YouTube commu-nity also thought Pepper was completely out of line, and they made sure to let him know.
There have even been reports and allegations that Pep-
per himself has actually sexually abused women — not just as a “prank.”  Although I was saddened to hear about 
these allegations, I wasn’t surprised. Someone sick enough 
to think joking about sexual assault is funny could also be sick enough to commit the act himself.
This got me thinking. The popularity of jokes about 
rape and sexual assault in ordinary conversations is alarm-ingly high.
“Did you take the chemistry test yet? It totally raped 
me.”
Really? Your chemistry test? I find it hard to respect 
anyone who clearly puts so little value on respecting the 
bodies and experiences of others.
On the Internet, especially on opinion-based websites 
like YouTube, the number of crude and thoughtless com-
ments that belittle and dismiss basic civility is ridiculous. It’s something we’ve all experienced — watching a video on YouTube and scrolling down aimlessly to the com-ments section where a barrage of hateful, misogynistic and violent language glares ominously at the viewer from 
the screen.I’ve seen death threats, decla-
rations that all women deserve 
to be sexually assaulted, and unwanted and excruciatingly 
graphic sexual innuendos all in 
the first few pages of a comment thread for a Taylor Swift 
lyric video.
Most people don’t treat each other so senselessly and 
hatefully offline. Unfortunately, because of the anonymity and the feeling of brash freedom that the digital world al-lows, the creepy Internet troll has become a regular part of online culture. As college students in a generation hooked 
by technology, we come into contact with these people 
more often than most.
It makes me angry that as hard as people fight against 
misogyny and rape culture in America, there will always be a horde of self-centered ignorant commenters sitting in front of their computers deciding to post hateful remarks online.
There will be horribly sick individuals who think it is 
a great idea to mock the experiences of sexual assault vic-tims through a “prank” video. There will be a hacker who is so stupidly excited by the private photographs of others he or she will decide to plaster them all over the Internet. These people exist, and they’re frighteningly common.
However, I’m not going to let the salivating, misogy-
nistic trolls of this generation’s media stop me from trying to live my life to the fullest. I’m not going to be dissuaded by the hate that can spawn from a single video — from 
a single instance of someone speaking out for women’s 
rights.
By standing together against Internet hate, we encour-
age the positive creativity the Internet makes possible. I hope all UF students remember this and help to create a more civil, tolerant and respectful Internet than what ex-ists today.

Vote or post a message at www.alligator.orgWednesday’s question: Do you think the 
California consent law is necessary?Today’s question: Have you used Grooveshark? Scott misleads 
mailers, part of 
disturbing trend
One of Gov. Rick Scott’s priorities during his time in office 
has been to make it more difficult for Floridians to vote.
Scott gained national notoriety for his 2012 voter 
purge: He and his allies in the Florida Division of Elections at-tempted to invalidate the voter registrations of more than 2,500 
Floridians prior to the presidential election.
Scott claimed that his goal was to remove noncitizens from 
Florida’s voter registration system. However, further investiga-
tion revealed that almost every single person on his list was in fact a U.S. citizen fully eligible to vote. Unsurprisingly, the list contained a disproportionate number of African Americans, Hispanics and other traditionally Democratic-leaning groups.
In April, a federal court ruled that Scott’s voter purge violated 
the National Voter Registration Act, which prohibits removing 
individuals from the voter rolls within 90 days of an election.
Now Scott is back to his old voter suppression tricks. Last 
week, Scott’s campaign mailed out pamphlets to thousands of 
Florida households claiming that they should have already re-ceived their absentee ballots. 
According to the Tampa Bay Times, election supervisors 
characterized the mailing as incorrect. In fact, the first day ab-sentee ballots could have been mailed out was Sept. 30. In many cities, absentee ballots will not be mailed out until Tuesday, ex-
actly four weeks before the November election.
Although the distribution of these mailings is not necessarily 
a voter suppression tactic, the misleading information they con-
tain will no doubt make the voting process more difficult for a significant number of Floridians. Some recipients of the mailing, frustrated with the confusion about the absentee ballot process, may simply throw their hands up and forego voting altogether.
Scott is trying to make voting in Florida more difficult be-
cause he knows he has lost public support. If traditionally low-
turnout groups like African Americans and Hispanics vote in 
droves, Scott doesn’t have a chance of being re-elected.
The governor is not alone in his use of these tactics. Mailings 
that foster voter suppression are becoming a national trend.
In North Carolina, Americans for Prosperity, a group sup-
ported by the Koch brothers, is under investigation for sending out voter registration mailers riddled with bad information. The group has been investigated for similar violations in Wisconsin.
The actual statistics about voter fraud in the U.S. are often 
discussed when the issue of voter suppression comes up, but they bear repeating. From 2000 to 2014, about 31 legitimate cases of voter fraud were uncovered out of more than one billion bal-lots cast. That’s .0000031 percent of all votes.
Put simply, voter fraud is not a problem in the U.S., and it 
is certainly not an issue that justifies making the voting process more difficult for thousands of Florida voters as Scott has done.
All Americans deserve an equal opportunity to voice their 
opinions at the ballot box. Scott should spend less time trying 
to suppress the vote and more time listening to the needs and 
concerns of ordinary Floridians.

People poured into the High Dive 
last October to watch a performance 
that sold out at the door. This year the 
venue will give the public not just one, 
but three chances to see this popular production.
Local actors and actresses will 
showcase a live, interactive perfor-mance of “The Rocky Horror Picture Show” while the original movie plays simultaneously, a popular way to show this cult-classic movie. 
The ﬁ  rst showing was Wednesday, 
and the last two are Oct. 9 and Oct. 13. Doors open at 9 p.m.
“The show will be on a bigger scale 
and more nights this year because it was a huge success and sold out last year,” said Patrick Lavery, the High Dive’s marketing and event coordina-tor.
Tori Bunnell, a 22-year-old UF an-
thropology senior who has been a fan of the production for several years, 
said, “There’s almost no chance I’d 
turn down a ‘Rocky Horror’ show.”
The performers will break what 
Shay Smith, a performer and the show’s director, calls “the fourth wall.” 
This means they will interact with 
audience members instead of ignoring them like in a traditional show.
This is Smith’s second time per-
forming with the local “Rocky Horror” cast and her ﬁ  rst time directing it.“There were so many different 
types of people and personalities in the audience last year,” she said.
“It’s a show suited for anyone 18 
and up,” she clariﬁ  ed.
Lavery encourages buying tickets, 
which are $5, ahead of time. 
Donations are suggested to support 
the performers’ passions as well as the 
High Dive. 
Money will be collected at the 
door.
“I’ve seen the actors put so much 
time and effort into the performance 
— sometimes 80 hours per week,” he said.
Tickets can be purchased directly 
from the High Dive, at 210 SW Second 
Ave., on highdivegville.com or at the 
door.
“It was a sellout last year,” Lavery 
said. “People are going to want to see 
it again.”

They’re hairy, they’re manly, 
they’re vulgar — they’re bur-
lesque.
The Hurly Burly Male Bur-
lesque troupe is on tour again, 
and tonight, its stage is The Back-
yard at Boca Fiesta.
“Dubbed ‘the hairiest bur-
lesque show you’ve ever seen,’ Hurly Burly combines comedy, props and a nod to classic bur-lesque together for a one of a kind experience,” said Garrett Bunton, the production manager 
and Butt Reynolds dancer for the 
troupe. “It’s a giant party!”
These tattooed and mustached 
men have been entertaining since 2010 and decided to take their talents and tighty-whities on the road to bring more awareness to the genre, Bunton said.“My friends saw them in Mi-
ami, and they thought their show was really fun,” said Jacob Ihde, 
owner of Boca Fiesta. “I wrote 
them six months ago, and they decided to go on tour, and I asked them to make a stop here.”
As Florida’s only all-male bur-
lesque revue, the heavily bearded group has piqued the interest of even the college-aged crowd.
“Men? Burlesque? This is 
something I have to see,” said Laura Paklin, a 19-year-old UF computer engineering sopho-more. “I mean, it sounds like something for cougars, but it seems entertaining enough to go to.”
Mischievous Madams, Gaines-
ville’s ﬁ  rst burlesque group, will 
accompany the troupe for this 
performance.
“The same thing, but the op-
posite,” Idhe said. “It adds a little bit more to the show.”
Tickets are $5 for an inappro-
priate night of fun, and the show starts at 10 p.m.Feast your eyes: Male

Soon women won’t have to worry 
so much about forgetting to take that 
pesky little pill, and guys can be in charge of birth control too.
Researchers will test a form of 
reversible male contraceptive called 
Vasalgel on primates this month, fol-
lowing a year of successful trials on rabbits and baboons. 
Vasalgel is a gel that is injected 
into the tube sperm swim through in order to block the sperm.
This new product, which is ex-
pected to be on the market within the 
next three years, has raised questions 
regarding the inﬂ  uence of contracep-
tion methods on gender roles.
Angel Kwolek-Folland, a UF pro-
fessor of history and women’s stud-
ies, pointed out that the introduction 
of anything that will block men’s 
sperm is a relatively new way of han-dling birth control and introduces a dynamic to sexual 
activity that hasn’t 
really been there before.
“One of the difﬁ  -
culties always with 
birth control is that 
the two partners in-
volved have a different stake in the 
outcome,” Kwolek-Folland said. 
“For a woman, she winds up preg-
nant, and her body goes through all 
of those changes,” she said. “Where-as for men, yes they, in theory, have 
responsibility for a child, but they 
don’t bear it.”
However, she said she does be-
lieve it is important for men to have the ability to control their own fertil-
ity if they choose. 
She added that a less permanent 
and less invasive choice is a good ad-
dition to current methods.
Although animal trials have had 
successful results, Adam Conrad, a 19-year-old UF nursing sophomore, is hesitant about Vasalgel.
“I don’t know how I feel about 
getting a reversible vasectomy,” Conrad said. 
“It seems a little bit risky because 
if they can’t reverse it or reversing it 
goes wrong, then I’m virtually cas-
trated.”
Conrad said he would want to 
wait a year or two for others to use Vasalgel and have it successfully 
reversed so he could see if there are 
unforeseen long-term effects of the product.
Megan Newsome, an 18-year-old 
UF astronomy freshman, believes 
the simplicity of the procedure and 
its reversibility makes Vasalgel at-tractive.
“It is nice to see an increase in re-
search regarding contraceptives for 
men so that both men and women 
can prevent conception without al-tering their sex lives or expecting 
anything from the woman alone,” 
Newsome said.Reversible male contraceptive in trialsex

Ever been bewildered by the multitude of 
forks, knives and spoons jostling for space at a 
formal dinner table? Which to use? When? And 
how did they get there, anyway?
Bee Wilson, author of “Consider the Fork: A 
History of How We Cook and Eat,” discusses 
the history of cutlery and how the implements 
we use at the table inﬂ  uence eating. While there 
are fork cultures and chopstick cultures, Wilson 
claims that spoons are used by every human cul-ture in the world.
Spoons are universal in that every society uses 
them for one purpose or another: serving, mea-
suring, conveying food from plate to mouth, stir-
ring, scraping, etc. The form of the spoon reveals much about a society: Chinese porcelain blue-and-white spoons for wonton soup and Russian 
spoons for sticky preserves. Also, spoons reﬂ  ect 
what people like to eat. Mother-of-pearl egg 
spoons indicated the Edwardian fondness for a soft-boiled egg (mother of pearl was used be-cause egg yolk stains silver).Having more kitchen gad-
getry produces “fork anxiety,” according to food writer Darra Goldstein, a nervous condition 
brought on by the smorgasbord 
of silverware laid out on the table. Etiquette books describe 
how to use silver knives, forks 
and spoons, such as one 19th century etiquette 
book researched by Wilson: “Soup must always 
be drunk from the edge of the soup spoon so you’re not getting too close to the soup.” (With 
the exception of men with moustaches. They 
were allowed to drink the soup from the end of 
the spoon.)
The use of the knife and fork coincides with 
the evolution of the ﬂ  atter china dinner plates. 
Knives and forks do not sit naturally in bowls 
but need a ﬂ  at surface. Forks were two, three or 
four prongs, which are also called “tines.” There 
are two methods for handling a hand and fork. The American method is “zigzag” eating, where 
you hold a knife in your right hand and a fork in 
the left and use it to “zigzag” around the plate 
to scoop up all the morsels. The British practice is another approach, which some consider to be 
more reﬁ  ned, described by never putting down the knife. The motion is a stately dance. Like oars on a boat, the fork impales and the knife cuts. The 
knife pushes and the fork carries.
Forks and knives hamper our eating with less 
dexterity in comparison to the one-handed chop-
sticks. The use of chopsticks takes a different ap-
proach to cuisine. Food is served already cut up 
and prepared by the cook. Literary theorist and 
philosopher Roland Barthes argued that chop-sticks were the polar opposite of the knife. When 
holding a knife, we treat our food as food — 
ready “to pierce, to mutilate.” With chopsticks, 
there is something “maternal” about them.  
Cultures shore the prejudice of eating with-
out tools. Touching food is a sign of slovenliness, 
lack of manners and limits what can be eaten. The 
technology of tableware cannot be understood 
solely in terms of function. There is little you can 
do with utensils that you cannot do with ﬁ  ngers and a bowl. The next time you pick up a spoon to 
eat cereal or use a fork and knife for salad, mar-
vel at the cutlery’s deeper signiﬁ  cance and how it 
reveals a society’s values and etiquette.Universal Cutlery Culture: the spoon’s diverse history

The blood, sweat and tears that go into build-
ing a reputation can all go to waste in an instant 
— especially once racy images are involved, as ce-lebrities have learned this past month.
Thousands of fans took to Twitter after celebri-
ties’ nude photographs were leaked due to an al-leged Apple iCloud security breach.  
The iCloud system allows users to sync email,  
photos and other data among Apple products.
At the beginning of September, Jennifer Law-
rence and Kate Upton, among others, had their photos allegedly stolen from their iCloud ac-counts. Gabrielle Union, Kim Kardashian and Rihanna fell prey to the same attacks.
“I’ve heard horror stories 
about iCloud, (with friends’) information being transferred to someone else’s computer,” said 
Johanna McCracken, a 20-year-
old UF applied physiology and kinesiology soph-
omore. “Their pictures, their text messages — just personal things that you necessarily wouldn’t want anyone to see.”
In a statement released by Apple, the company 
said none of the cases investigated thus far have resulted from any breach from Apple’s systems, including iCloud or Find my iPhone.
David Stanton, the technical lead of Mobiqui-
ty and a visiting professor, said the images were probably obtained through a hacker who worked his or her way into Apple’s iCloud system by guessing security questions and email addresses of public ﬁ  gures without being locked out after several attempts. 
“Breaking into iCloud is very hard,” he said,  
“and if you did, getting the information on a spe-
ciﬁ  c set of users would also be very hard, if not 
impossible.”Tips for keeping your nudes private

Pauly Shore, clad in jeans and 
an open flannel shirt, ambles onto 
Rockeys Dueling Piano Bar’s 
small stage.
“You know what the f**ked 
up thing about me is?” he asks 
the crowd of hooting Gainesville 
residents in his signature stoner-
surfer parlance. “I always look f**ked up.”
The rest of his act followed as 
such: jokes about growing older, 
brief descents into his famous 
character “The Weasel,” jabs at his own, often joked-about, ca-reer and a string of toe-curling 
one-liners about his sex life. One 
of the tamer ones: “I love having sex with hipster girls, but it’s very tiring,” he intoned. “You have to get up every 15 minutes to flip the 
record.”
Shore appeared at Rockeys on 
Sept. 24 for its weekly comedy 
showcase, Comedy BOOM! On 
Wednesdays, Rockeys trades its 
rowdy piano-bar scene for a more laid-back, comedy club-inspired atmosphere. In an effort to ex-pand Comedy BOOM! audiences, 
the owners are focusing on bring-
ing in national comedy acts, like Shore, in addition to local comics.
The Avenue spoke with Shore 
after his performance about the changing comedy scene, his love of Bill O’Reilly and why millen-
nials should listen to what he has 
to say.
■   ■   ■
What have been some of your 
favorite fan interactions?
The thing that I have that’s 
transcended ... a lot of comics is that I’m very connected with the people. It’s not about my jokes, it’s not about my movies —  it’s 
about me. People feel connected 
with me because I’m very real — and when I was on MTV, all that s**t was very authentic. It was always coming from a real place, and people are connected with it. All races, all ages. I’m very for-tunate. You know, my career has 
gone up and down, up and down, 
but throughout it, I’ve had these great fans who are just, like, legit. 
Is there a Pauly Shore line 
that you’re sick of hearing fans quote back to you?
No, I’m not like that. I think 
it’s cute that people say that stuff to me. Like, people are adorable; 
they’re so passionate about it. 
“Wheez the juice,” “What’s up, buddy,” all that stuff. They’re into it, and I think it’s adorable.
Are there any comics or direc-
tors you haven’t worked with yet that you’d like to?
I like Bill O’Reilly. He’s so 
mean it’s hysterical. He’s such an 
a**hole, it’s awesome. He’s hys-
terical. [Imitates O’Reilly] “Well Pauly, well Pauly.” You guys should tweet at him. Tell him to 
get me on his show. 
We’ll start a viral campaign.
That’d be sick. He’s so funny. 
That’s my sense of humor. These guys are funny to me.
You joked about comedy 
changing since you’ve been on the scene. What are some of the biggest changes you’ve observed 
since you started in the ’90s?
It’s like, I have this thing I say: 
The Internet is really awesome for talent, and then the Internet 
is really bad for talent. It’s awe-some because it gives people the opportunity to get their s**t out there, and it’s bad because it 
gives people the opportunity to 
get their s**t out there. There’s so much clutter that gets out there that’s just bad.
If you could change anything 
about comedy today, what would you change?
Everyone’s trying to figure 
it out, figure out how to make it 
—  music or acting or comedy or 
singing or this or that. And there’s a lot of people (who) think that they’re funny who just aren’t fun-ny. So comedy is just one of those things. Stand-up comedy is very 
sensitive, and it should be taken 
very seriously. It’s not a hobby. It’s your life. It’s like weightlifting. If you’re a weightlifter, you’re into 
your body and you don’t just do 
it for competition. You’re always doing it; you’re always working out. It’s a lifestyle, and unless you are part of that lifestyle, then 
don’t do it. Don’t waste stage 
time, don’t waste your time and don’t waste other people’s time. Don’t kind of do it.
Is there any reason in par-
ticular why, after so many years, you’ve stuck with “The Weasel” on stage for your act?
I think that you don’t want to bite the hand that feeds you, num-ber one. But I also think that my stuff isn’t just that. You have to give the people what they want; 
that’s what they came to see. But 
then you also have to make them say, “Oh, I learned some stuff about him as a person.” It’s like 
the movie I did, “Pauly Shore is 
Dead.” I want to appeal to the people that like the old stuff, but I also want to appeal to the people that maybe don’t like me, 
who say, “Well, what’s he do-
ing?” My new documentary and my podcast answers all that. The thing is, I’m 46 now. The young 
people, I think, should listen to 
what I have to say, because I’m at a place right now where I’ve done a lot. And I know that as a younger person I like to look up to people in their 50s, 60s and 70s and say, “What the f**k did they do?” I’ve been through a lot, and I’ve experienced a lot. Hopefully 
those people will be inspired by 
the podcast or the documentary. I think they will.

Chillin’ with ‘The Weasel’: Our Q-and-A with Pauly Shorecomedy
Erika Canfijn / Alligator

BOOM! series Sept. 24. His new documentary, “Pauly Shore Stands Alone,” premieres Dec. 4 on Show -

CODY SMITH
Avenue Writer
On the first day of class, a UF 
chemistry professor plays a song: 
It’s an original dedicated to the tri-
als and tribulations of freshman 
chemistry. 
The song? “Bonds of Life.” The 
professor? Charles Martin.
This Friday, his students will 
get the chance to see their profes-sor perform his music live. 
Martin, also known by his mu-
sical persona “Chuck,” will per-form Friday from 7:30 to 10:30 p.m. at the Brew Spot Cafe, at 1000 NE 16th Ave. 
Owned by former UF chemistry 
professor Jeff Keaffaber, the Brew Spot acts as a restaurant and tutor-
ing center by day and moonlights 
as a musical venue and bar. Stu-dents often go there for tutoring in basic all the way up to organic 
chemistry. 
Martin is no stranger to per-
forming and recording music. 
With five albums under his belt, the professor/singer-songwriter 
began his music career at 10 years 
old. However, a pressure to be the first in his family to attend college pushed him away from music.“(My) hiatus 
from music lasted through my as-sistant professor 
years when I was 
at Texas A&M University,” he 
said. “I worked all the time and 
had no time for anything else.”
After getting tenure at Texas 
A&M, he moved to Colorado and 
realized something was missing from his life. 
“I decided it was time to return 
to music,” he said. “I’ve been pur-suing music seriously ever since.”
Inspired by The Beatles, Marvin Gaye, Frank Zappa and songwrit-ers such as Cole Porter, Martin picked up the guitar after watch-ing The Beatles perform on “The 
Ed Sullivan Show.” 
“I begged my mother to buy 
me a guitar,” he said. “She was a 
classically trained pianist, as was 
her mother, so I think she was 
sympathetic to my desire to learn music.”
Martin has released five suc-
cessful albums: two with his rocka-
billy band, dblWiDE; two with his 
psychedelic rock band, The Righ-teous Kind; and his latest “Genius Boy Music” as a solo artist. “Making this album was a very 
liberating experience because I went in to the project with the no-tion that it would not conform to any musical genre,” he said. 
Released in 2014, “Genius Boy 
Music” incorporated rock, jazz, rhythm and blues, country and a number of other genres. 
As distinguished professor and 
musician, Martin praises the local music scene and the talent that comes to Gainesville.
“On almost any night, you can 
see world-class musical entertain-ment in an intimate setting here,” he said. “DJs, EDM and other forms of electronic music are now attract-
ing larger audiences, especially 
among college-age GNVers.”

Watson advances to main draw
Despite losing his third-round match in the ITA All-
American qualifying draw on Wednesday, Gordon Watson advanced to the tournament’s main draw.Marcus Mariota and Oregon face Arizona tonight. Read about this week’s games to watch on Page 16. New alligatorSports Podcast
On the latest alligatorSports Podcast, Richard Johnson, Jonathan Czupryn and Morgan Moriarty talk about Florida-Tennessee, Richard and Jonathan’s wild Wednesday night and much more.RICHARD JOHNSON
Alligator Staff Writer @RagjUF
A maligned group, constantly groaned about by 
Florida fans in 2013, is now one of strength. 
It’s amazing what happens when offensive linemen 
play in the positions they’re best suited for with no in-
juries to shake up the group.
Max Garcia is a rock at center. Roderick Johnson is a 
wonder kid at right tackle, and David Sharpe, the other 
wet-behind-the-ears freshman, isn’t far behind him on 
the outside either. 
Trip Thurman along with Tyler Moore have been 
consistent in his play at guard and Trenton Brown has moved opposite them and brought his phone booth 
size frame to play well at a spot often termed as play-
ing inside of one.
Chaz Green, free from the snare of nagging injury, 
has shown he can be solid at either tackle spot this sea-
son. 
What has been missing is the for-
mer No. 1 offensive tackle recruit in 
the nation in D.J. Humphries, but he 
plans to be back Saturday against Ten-
nessee after sitting out with a chipped 
bone in his ankle.
“Yeah, it was one of those things 
like, ‘Here it is again,’” Humphries 
said. 
“You know what I mean? I never really had any in-
juries where I did anything that hurt me. I always have 
people kind of falling on me. It was one of them things like, ‘Again?’ I’m more ready now, though. Back on the Kan Li / Alligator Staff
Chaz Green (75) prepares to guard Alabama defensive lineman Jonathan Allen (93) during the Gators’ 42-21 loss 
to the Crimson Tide on Sept. 20 at Bryant-Denny Stadium. Green started at left tackle in UF’s past two contests for the injured D.J. Humphries, who is expected to play in Florida’s game against Tennessee on Saturday.
Humphries set to return to Gators’ offensive line against Volunteers
SEE FOOTBALL, PAGE 15
JORDAN MCPHERSON
Alligator Staff Writer @J_McPherson1126
Florida defensive coordinator D.J. 
Durkin did not enjoy watching his de-
fense struggle against Alabama.
In the 42-21 loss against the Crim-
son Tide, the Gators surrendered a program-high 672 yards, 43 yards more than the previous high of 629 suffered against Nebraska in the 1996 Fiesta 
Bowl.
“Not very fun,” Durkin said. “You 
put a lot of time and work into the 
game plan and our players do as well and that’s all of us together.”
Now heading into Saturday’s match-
up against Tennessee, Durkin’s defense will be without defensive tackle Leon 
Orr (knee) and possibly without line-
backer Mike Taylor (knee).
In Orr’s absence, Jonathan Bullard 
will play on the interior of the defen-sive line. Joey Ivie, Gerald Willis and Taven Bryan will also receive more in-
game reps.
If Taylor is unable to compete 
against the Volunteers, the rotation at 
Mike linebacker will be limited to Nei-ron Ball, Antonio Morrison and Jarrad Davis.
Ball, who is tied for the team lead in 
sacks (two) and is fourth in tackles (15) is one who Durkin has praised.
“I thought he’s played really well 
and consistent for us all year long,” Durkin said. “At Alabama he played well, he did some things we would have liked to have done differently or better. Like a lot of guys he played a lot of snaps in that game … so some of those mistakes he made or breakdowns in the game were a matter of him be-ing out there that long. But he has to be 
able to do that and again he’ll play a lot 
of snaps this coming Saturday. Overall Bullard, Ivie take over for OrrOTERO’S OPINION
If you’re tired of reading hard-hitting news about Jeff Driskel’s fate as start-
ing quarterback and coach Will Muschamp’s conﬁ  dence in him, you’ve come to the right article at the right time.
On today’s agenda: volleyball 
nicknames.
Yes, you heard that right ladies and gen-
tlemen. I will be taking you through the inner workings of volleyball serving nicknames.
Now, if you’ve never been to a volleyball 
match, than ﬁ  rst of all, shame on you. Second of all, anyone who serves has a nickname.
First up, senior libero Holly Pole. The fans 
call her Sweetness when she serves.
Why you ask?I actually have no idea.And neither does she.“I had no idea what it was until like, 
actually a couple weeks ago,” Pole said. “I remember asking somebody because I hear everybody else’s, but I don’t hear mine when I’m serving. And I have no idea what it means or why it’s sweetness. It’s funny, but I don’t get it.”
Maybe it’s because her name is 
Holly, and Holly is often associat-ed with Christmas and Christmas has candy, and candy is sweet?
Nope, you know what, I don’t know.Next is Taylor Unroe, the 2013 Southeast-
ern Conference Libero of the Year.
Anytime Unroe serves, I always look to 
the students that yell out the nicknames (you know who you are, people who sit by the band) because they have a makeshift row-boat picture they wave in the air as they yell, “row your boat.”
It’s cute and funny and the crowd knows 
that one the best.
For the ﬁ  nal senior, Maddy Monserez, she 
has the most comedic of the nicknames.Sweetness: Breaking down Florida 
volleyball’s serving nicknames

UF FOOTBALLThe senior is having a great year 
with only three service errors on 
85 serves, so naturally I would talk about her nickname.
But, if I’m being honest it’s not 
really a nickname, just more like a parenthetical phrase after her name.
The announcer says, “Maddy 
Monserez to serve” and you hear 10 
guys yell out, “huh, huh. Oui, oui,” 
in the frenchiest-French accent they can create.
It’s clever, and Monserez likes it, 
so there’s that.
Leading the team in service aces 
(22) is junior Mackenzie Dagostino, or as the crowd likes to call her Mack ‘n’ Cheese. Which is amazing. 
It’s not hard to figure out where 
her nickname came from, I mean, she’s awesome, mac and cheese is awesome, so clearly they would be synonymous.
Oh and her name is Mackenzie.
The newest, and my personal 
favorite, nickname is freshman out-
side hitter Carli Snyder.
Her nickname is “Goldilocks” 
because she has wild blonde hair that I am seriously envious of.
She’s only served in four match-
es so far, but it was enough to bring out a new nickname.
Continuing on with the newbies 
is freshman middle blocker Rhamat Alhassan, who has quickly become a fan favorite.
But despite that fan-favoritism 
she receives one of the lamest of all the nicknames. I’m actually very disappointed in the people that give these out because they lost an opportunity to make a play on her height. 
Instead, she has been nicknamed 
“Awesome.” I assume it’s because she is quite awesome on the court (I mean she’s chest high to the net when she jumps), but also because her last name – Alhassan – sounds a little teeny, tiny bit like awesome.
Finally, there is Nikki O’Rourke, 
who is called Nikki-Tikki-Tavi – a play-on of the children’s book, “Rikki-Tikki-Tavi.”
It’s pretty funny, and actually 
rather clever.
And it’s Monserez’s favorite 
name.
“I think it’s pretty cool,” Mon-
serez said. “It sounds cool when they say it. It’s a lot of syllables.”THURSDAY, OCTOBER 2, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15

field. I’m happy.”
Humphries returns to a Florida unit that is 
allowing .67 sacks per game, 13th nationally 
and has only allowed five yards to be lost on 
two total sacks. 
The yardage number is good for third na-
tionally. The total sack number is fifth nation-ally.
“I love having D.J. on the field,” Garcia 
said. “Just having his energy really lifts us all up. You could really tell when he was out, 
during practice we just didn’t have that much 
fire that D.J. brings every day. So I’m just re-ally excited to have him back and it’s going to take him a little bit to get him back to where 
he was, playing to the speed of the game after 
being out. 
“But I’m sure he’s going to do a good job 
on Saturday.”The Gators head to Knoxville, Tenn., on  
Saturday, the site of Humphries’ first colle-giate road game. 
He was wide-eyed then, entranced by an 
insane atmosphere. 
Two years later, it’s his job to impart the 
wisdom on Johnson that Green and former Gators Xavier Nixon and Jon Halapio gave to him. 
It was simply that he needed to calm down 
on the field. 
Humphries said when he first suited up for 
UF he had trouble consistently keeping his cool throughout a full game because he was 
so energetic. One good thing would happen 
and he’d dwell on it instead of moving on to the next play.
“(Johnson) reminds me a lot of me when I 
was a kid, when I was a younger,” Humphries 
said. 
“He’s so energetic and just excited to play 
ball and just turnt up as soon as he makes a 
play he’s just ready to sell out everybody. I 
just try to tell him you gotta calm down, bro, 
just be ready to make the next play, good or bad and be ready to do the same thing over again.”UF’s offensive line is allowing 
just .67 sacks per game
Tennessee tailback Hurd excelling
Neiron has played really consistent for us and I’m 
happy for him.” 
Ya Hurd: Jalen Hurd is making a name for him-
self.
Through the Volunteers’ first four games, the 
freshman tailback leads UT with 328 rushing yards and two rushing scores while averaging 4.6 yards per rush.
Against Georgia on Saturday, Hurd tallied 138 to-
tal yards and a touchdown on 27 touches.
“I just think he’s gaining more and more confi-
dence each game,” Durkin said. “I think their coach-ing staff is gaining more confidence in him each game. ... He’s a guy that’s got good playing experi-ence now. He’s playing within their scheme and do-ing well.”
But Florida linebacker Jarrad Davis has other 
plans in mind for Hurd.
“He’s physical. He’s fast, but he doesn’t have top 
end speed. We have to come downhill, we have to hit him early. We have to let him know what it is and we have to welcome him to the SEC,” Davis said. “Geor-gia was a big test for him, that’s a physical team. But I feel like we have more to offer for him. … I don’t think he can hang with us. He’s a good athlete, but we’ve got a whole defense coming for him.”noteS , from page 14footbALL , from page 14

If you haven’t watched as much college foot-
ball so far this fall as you may have wanted to, 
this is the weekend to plop yourself in front of the TV all day and do so. This week, there are six games that pit Top-25 teams against each other, and most  of them have college football playoff implications.
No. 2 Oregon vs Arizona — tonight, 
10:30pm, ESPN
Last season, the Arizona Wildcats 
welcomed then-No. 5 Oregon to Tuscon, Ariz., and shocked the Ducks and the rest of the college football world by winning 
42-16. This year’s game is in Eugene, Ore., 
though, and the Ducks’ high-powered of-fense led by quarterback Marcus Mariota looks unstoppable. 
The Wildcats are undefeated, so let’s 
see if Rich Rod can pull off a huge road upset.
Florida @ Tennessee — Saturday, 
noon, SEC Network
Florida has won the last nine in the se-
ries, but the Volunteers look close to get-ting their ﬁ  rst win in Southeastern Con-ference play. They have the opportunity against a struggling Florida team on Sat-urday.
No. 6 Texas A&M @ No. 12 Mississippi 
State — noon, ESPN
TAMU is coming off an emotional over-
time win over Arkansas at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, in which Kenny “Trill” Hill’s magic gave the Aggies a victory. Meanwhile, Dan Mullen is coming off the biggest win of his career — a 34-29 victory over LSU in Death Valley. Hill versus Mis-sissippi State’s Dak Prescott will be one of the best quarterback battles of the season.
No. 3 Alabama @ No. 11 Ole Miss — 
3:30pm, CBS
The atmosphere at Ole Miss will be sky-
high on Saturday, given the Rebels earned the prized 3:30 CBS slot, and ESPN’s Col-lege GameDay is visiting The Grove for the ﬁ  rst time ever in the show’s history. Not 
to mention they get a chance to knock off 
the No. 3 team in the country. The Rebels’ strength of schedule has been poor up to this point, but both the offense and defense has looked good so far. The Tide’s offense is ﬁ  nally clicking under Lane Kifﬁ  n, hang-ing 672 yards on Florida two weeks ago. If both Mississippi State and Ole Miss get W’s, the state of Mississippi will have the 
most buzz of any state south of the Mason-
Dixon.
No. 4 Oklahoma @ No. 25 TCU — 
3:30pm, FOX
The Sooners are undefeated and ﬁ  ring 
on all cylinders on both sides of the ball. While Oklahoma’s strength of schedule is pretty poor, the Horned Frogs cracked 
the Top-25 last week and are undefeated 
as well. If TCU pulls off the upset, a major domino will fall in the CFB Playoff pic-ture.
No. 14 Stanford @ No. 9 Notre Dame — 
3:30pm, NBC  
Fighting Irish quarterback Everett Gol-
son gets his toughest test so far facing the 
No. 1 ranked total defense in the country. 
If the Cardinal upsets the Irish at home, it could likely spoil their chances at a playoff bid. 
No. 15 LSU @ No. 5 Auburn — 7:00pm, 
ESPN
This game isn’t as hyped as it was at the beginning of the year, but that was before Mississippi State’s upset of the Tigers in Week 4. Keep in mind, though, that LSU gave Auburn its only regular season loss  in 2013. Freshman Brandon Harris will have his ﬁ  rst start at quarterback for LSU, too. No. 19 Nebraska @ No. 10 Michigan 
State — 8:00pm, ABC
Heisman hopeful Ameer Abdullah gets 
his ﬁ  rst big test this weekend facing the No. 6 ranked Spartans run defense. It’s a down year in the Big Ten, but this is still a match up with Big Ten title and possibly playoff game implications.
