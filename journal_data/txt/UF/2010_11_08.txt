ligator to free his dog from its jaws. 
Tom Martino said he and his Jack Rus-
sell terrier Lizabeth were walking along the 
Hillsborough River in Tampa on Thursday when the alligator wrestled the 15-pound dog into the water.
Martino started shooting into the water 
around the alligator to scare it into releasing the 9-year-old dog. 
He performed CPR on the dog until it coughed up water and started breathing 
again.
Lizabeth was being treated for alligator 
bites and lung injuries from being underwa-
ter.
A Florida Fish and Wildlife Conserva-
tion Commission trapper captured the 5- to 
6-foot alligator Thursday night. Martino has 
a concealed weapons permit.

Junior Chris Rainey celebrates after a touchdown catch in the second quarter 
of the Gators’ 55-14 win against Vanderbilt in Nashville, Tenn. on Saturday.

NASHVILLE, Tenn. — The Gators put up a 
season-high point total, took a game by the larg-
est margin of victory this year and held an oppo-nent to a season low in total yardage Saturday.
But there wasn’t much celebration from Flor -
ida after its 55-14 win against Vanderbilt. Not with a chance to clinch a spot in the Southeastern Conference Championship just a week away.
“We’re done (celebrating),” UF coach Urban 
Meyer said minutes after the game ended. “The coaches are already working on it as we speak, 
on South Carolina and having thoughts. We’re 
going to come in tomorrow and do the best we 
can. This is what we work for. This is the whole deal.”
With the win, Florida (6-3, 4-3 SEC) turned 
next week’s showdown with South Carolina into a winner-take-all battle for the SEC East.
The Gators and the Commodores (2-7, 1-5 
SEC) started slow as they combined for 10 pos-sessions and seven punts in the first quarter, but that changed — at least for Florida.
UF exploded with 34 points in the second 
quarter, ignited by Chris Rainey’s second blocked punt of the game.  Both punts set up touchdowns for the Gators.
Rainey, playing in his second game after a 
five-game suspension, also caught a 40-yard pass in the end zone with a Vanderbilt corner -‘IT’S CHAMPIONSHIP WEEK’
 250 ARTISTS SHOWED OFF THEIR GOODS AT THE FESTIVAL.
By JENNA HOSTETLER
Alligator Contributing Writer
About 100,000 people bundled in 
sweaters and scarves crowded down-
town this weekend to munch on fried 
food, shop for jewelry and admire lo-cal and national art. 
One of the 250 artists at the festi-
val, Reuben Wilkerson, of Alachua, 
said he depends on festivals like Gainesville’s to sustain himself as 
an artist, which wasn’t possible for him 40 years ago. 
In 1968, recently married, he 
wanted to support his new bride the best way he could. So he painted one 
final portrait, a portrait of her, and 
then decided to give up art and went to work at General Electric Co. 
But in 2000, at 53, Wilkerson began 
to produce art again. On Sunday, he sat in a small, white tent filled with his work. A sign outside his booth Art show

LOCAL CRIME
By KAT BEIN
Alligator Staff Writer
The suspect in the recent double-homicide of two local resi-
dents was shot and arrested by police Saturday.
Sharon Norman and Anthony Hall, both 38, were shot and 
killed in their car Thursday during what police believe was a 
drug transaction, according to Alachua County Sheriff’s Office 
spokesman Art Forgey.
Police received a call from a passing motorist at about 9:50 
Thursday night and found the car at 6500 SW 85th Ave. with its 
hazard lights on and the victims inside, Forgey said.Sheriff deputies and EMS arrived and declared the vic-
tims dead on the scene. Norman was found slumped over the driving wheel, while Hall was found on the other side of the road in a ditch, he said.
Detectives worked over the weekend to 
find a suspect, interviewing family, friends and neighbors, as well as compiling witness 
statements and phone records, Forgey said.
Detectives identified Mitch Smith, 32, 
as the suspect and were granted a warrant 
for his arrest. A member of the ASO SWAT team was driving by Smith’s trailer Saturday , scoping out the area, when Smith walked out the door to leave, Forgey said.
The deputy parked his police car and walked out to meet 
him, ordering him to stop, and then Smith pulled a pistol out 
of his waistband.
The deputy fired first, shooting Smith in his upper torso. He 
was taken to Shands at UF and was originally in critical condi-
tion but has since recovered into stable condition, Forgey said.
Smith is in ASO’s custody and will be taken to Alachua 
County Jail upon his release from Shands. He is charged with two counts of homicide and may be charged for his confronta-tion with the deputy, Forgey said.Police shoot, arrest suspect in double murder caseSEE FOOTBALL, PAGE 15SEE ART, PAGE 8

Six hundred dodgeballs and 527 people were not 
enough to break the world record. 
The Inter-Residence Hall Association hosted a 
dodgeball tournament on Sunday afternoon in an at-
tempt to break the world record for the largest orga-nized game.  
Five hundred and twenty-seven people showed up 
to play , falling short of the required 1,745 players, a record currently held by the University of California, Irvine.
Adam Lindsley, a co-director of the event, said 
when they first had the idea, the record was only 450 people, but UC Irvine has since made 1,745 people the new record. 
“We wanted to break the world record, but most 
importantly, we wanted to provide a program to the on-campus residents and the students of UF in general that they could really enjoy,” Lindsley said.  
Jacob Speedy, co-director with Lindsley, said the 
goal was to reach 2,000 people. 
The event was open to UF students, faculty and 
staff. The referees were UF students.
After seeing the number of people who showed up, 
Speedy said he was just shooting for 1,000.
Lindsley said the purpose of the event was to pro-
mote the Boys & Girls Club of Alachua County.
IRHA has tried to break a world record before, 
hosting the attempt for the world’s largest water bal-loon fight last spring. 
That event was also unsuccessful.Cody Degroff, 20, of Santa Fe College, said he had a 
lot of fun participating anyway.
“Even though the record wasn’t broken, I was still 
really glad I managed to get up and get out to do it,” Degroff said.

SUPREME COURT
By LIBERTY BOSTWICK
Alligator Contributing Writer
The Supreme Court of the United States will make a 
decision that may affect the rights of inventors and re-
searchers at universities across the nation, including UF.
The Supreme Court decided to hear a case on the spe-
cifics of the Patent and Trademark Law Amendments Act of 1980 last Monday. The court will hear Stanford Uni-versity’s lawsuit against Roche Co. to decide whether federally funded projects are the property of universities. 
A lower court ruled in favor of Roche, which questioned 
whether universities have complete ownership of materi-als produced there.
Karl R. Zawoy, assistant director of engineering at 
UF’s Office of Technology Licensing, said he does not think there should be a change in licensing rights for uni-versities. 
He said Stanford should own the rights to work cre-
ated with the university. Researchers think they should 
have full rights to their own work, but they use university 
resources, he said. 
“When it comes down to it,” he said, “licensing through 
universities is necessary because we have the ability to provide the services and protection professors need in or -
der to complete their work successfully.”
The department’s job is to assist and protect the faculty 
of the university, Zawoy said. The department is neces-sary to protect all parties in negotiations.
He said most professors who want to patent things on 
their own don’t know how to handle the legal side of li-censing. The licensing office is available to advise the pro-fessors on legal issues when dealing with outside com-panies. 
One of the biggest challenges the office faces is when 
a company or one of the researchers is under pressure for time because they can overlook the minute legal details that are so important, he said. 
Another struggle for the department is when a re-
searchers have impressive new technology, several com-panies want to invest in their research. The professors are often tempted to try to work with multiple sponsors, which can cause drastic legal problems, he said. 
The licensing office can’t tell professors what to pub-
lish, what research to do or whom to work with, Zawoy said. The department’s purpose is to maintain a balance between the university and outside companies so one side does not take advantage of the other.
A common example of exploitation that Zawoy has 
seen is when companies accidentally or intentionally 
write “reach through” clauses in their contracts with the university. This allows companies to get rights to the research-
er’s future or past property, even if it’s 
not related to the current project.
“That is a worst-case scenario,” he 
said, “but the licensing office takes it 
very seriously.” 
Zawoy has worked on deals that have 
taken up to two years to negotiate. Typi-
cally this is because companies wanted special rights to a researcher’s technology, he said. 
Everything to do with licensing tends to be lengthy, 
he said. It took seven years to finalize a contract between the Board of Trustees and the university for UF’s official stance on licensing. The subject of intellectual property took up the majority of that time.
Raul A. Chinga, a doctoral student in electrical engi-
neering and research assistant in radio frequency circuits and systems research lab, worked on a project creating wireless chargers through UF.  His name is included in 
the patent. 
Chinga thinks that it would be good for researchers 
to have complete rights over property produced through UF because of the money involved. However, he believes 
the university should also have rights because student re-searchers earn their degrees through UF. 
He said students on their own would not have the 
opportunity to use all the equipment that is available through UF. The university also sets up the situation for student researchers to work with a company and get field 
experience. 
“The great thing is that your name will still appear 
on all patents for projects you work on, so you still get 
credit,” he said. 
Student researchers also get paid for their work. The 
university takes a big chunk and the rest gets disbursed down the chain of command of people who work in the labs, he said. 
Chinga has not had problems with patents or prop-
erty legalities; his only bad experience was when his lab’s sponsoring company tried to run the lab. He said UF stepped in and set boundaries to protect the student researchers from being overworked. 
Many of the student researchers are not aware of the 
legalities of dealing with patents. He said it’s nice to know UF is involved to back students up so they don’t have to worry about the fine print on everything they sign.  
When they become research assistants, students sign 
contracts that waive their rights to their intellectual prop-erty on projects on which they work. Chinga said that is a typical process for almost every company, so it’s not any different from the real world. 
He said he appreciates UF because of how much time 
and money the university spends on securing patents and making sure the researchers are protected. 
“Unless you invent something on your own and make 
your own company and promote it, you shouldn’t have 
complete rights to it,” he said. “Universities give you 
more credit than companies do, so it’s better.”Patent decision will affect UF researchers, inventors

� UF’S GRADUATE CREATIVE 
WRITING PROGRAM HOSTED THE EVENT.
By CHELSEA HULL
Alligator Contributing Writer
Methamphetamine dealers and a 
girl shaped like a pickle jar were top-
ics of conversation among students 
and writers this weekend.
The 61st annual Florida Writers’ 
Festival, held Friday and Saturday, 
gave students and members of the 
literary community an opportunity 
to listen to the experiences and ad-
vice of award-winning authors. 
Pulitzer Prize winner Henri Cole; 
James Lasdun,  an author of one of 
The Atlantic magazine’s Best Five 
Books of 2009; and Wells Tower, 
named one of America’s 20 best writers under 40 by The New York-er, each gave readings at Smathers Library East to crowds of about 125 graduate students, avid readers and writing hobbyists. 
Tower read from one of his sto-
ries about a girl “with a figure like 
a pickle jar” and one he transcribed from a former methamphet-amine dealer who he said had a natural 
rhythm and tone for storytelling. 
On Saturday afternoon, the au-
thors spoke at the Headquarters Li-brary about their methods for what they described as the madness of the writing process. The festival, hosted by the UF graduate program for cre-ative writing, was sponsored by the Alachua County Library District, the Friends of the George A. Smathers Library and several private donors.
“It’s important to expose stu-
dents to as many different authors as possible,” said Jeanne Fillman-Richards, a long-time sponsor of the festival and mother of a creative writing graduate student. “I think literature is a dying art. Language is a dying art.”
David Fishman and Hilary Jac-
qmin, the festival organizers, said they are working to change that. In previous years, the event was facul-ty-run, but this year the second-year poetry graduate students spear -
headed the planning process. 
“The purpose is to bring excel-
lent writers to present their work to the community,” Fishman said. “At the informal talks, there was an op-
portunity to ask questions about the 
craft. That goes beyond entertain-
ment; it’s something that will actu-ally be useful to writers.”Authors, 
poets join at annual

Today’s question: Have you worn a scarf yet this semester?Friday’s question: Do you plan on going to the art festival this weekend?
96 TOTAL VOTES43% YES57% NOAmerica needs bipartisanship now
Election night is over.
We’ve all seen the news, and whether or not 
we’re happy with the results, it’s time to move on, 
drink all the tea we can get and try to look forward to 
where we go from here. 
Florida Senator-elect Marco Rubio and our new 
Speaker of the House John Boehner got it right in their 
postelection speeches.
 The election results are a message that Americans are 
worried about the way the government is heading. This 
is why people have decided to give Republicans a second chance to lead — a second chance to do what they were 
supposed to do not too long ago.
But here’s the tricky part, Gators. If Republicans go 
back to acting the way they did before 2008 and don’t 
deliver on the promises they made on the campaign trail, 
then it’ll only be two years until the next elections see 
sweeping partisan reform. 
This country is headed in the wrong direction, and 
it’s clear neither party can fix anything on its own. From here it’s obvious both parties need to work together if 
America is going to go back to being the greatest country 
this side of Rome. Republicans in the House and Senate are going to need to be able to work with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and President Barack Obama to ac-
complish what needs to be done. 
Thankfully, both Boehner and Obama seemed to 
understand this during their respective postelection 
speeches.
 We’ll be able to see if the president and Congress can 
put our money where their mouths are when it comes time for the president to submit his budget to Congress. If the two parties are able to come together to avoid put-ting the government in a tempo-rary lockdown and form a bipar -
tisan Team America, then we’re in 
business. 
Now, I know a lot of people are 
running around  worrying about 
the government not being able to 
get anything accomplished during 
these two years with a split-party 
government, but there’s still hope. 
Assuming we aren’t living in a “Matrix”-inspired 
world, our existence proves the world didn’t end with 
the split government in the Clinton administration or 
Reagan’s midterm split. 
Things didn’t go completely downhill, but  rather, our 
country flourished following these past partisan splits. 
During the ‘90s, we actually had a federal budget sur -
plus, the first since 1969. Having Republicans in control of the Congress forced Clinton to negotiate with Con-gressional leaders to get anything done, something he did very successfully. This negotiation forced our gov-
ernment to become far more moderate, and we can see in 
retrospect our country as a whole was far greater during that time. 
However, Clinton was far more moderate of a Demo-
crat than Obama is and tea partiers have made the Re-publican Party more conservative than ever before. But if either want this country to succeed, they’ll need to be willing to work together like the Republicans and Demo-crats of the late ‘90s did.
Let’s get to work, America. Chris Dodson is a first-year finance and journalism stu-
dent. His column appears every Monday. UF has a case of the Mondays. 
And as the master lyricist Enrique Iglesias might 
say: Baby, we like it.
Today, UF will join more than 30 universities across the 
nation in its first (almost) Meat-Free Monday. 
 And don’t get your overalls and pitchforks in a bunch 
— Mondays won’t be totally meatless, but the Fresh Food 
Company and Gator Corner Dining Center on-campus caf-eterias will offer more vegan options for those who want to be a little greener (and leaner).
Harvard nutritionist Jean Mayer estimates if every Ameri-
can reduced his or her meat consumption by just 10 percent, which is less than one day per week, enough grains would be available from not being fed to factory-farmed animals to 
feed 60 million starving people. And those are the kind of 
statistics we like to hear. 
We hope UF’s dining administration will take meat com-
pletely off the menu on Mondays at its dining halls in the future. 
While we know it’s not our place to push a meat-free diet 
(our trash cans here have a fair number of Gator Dawgs box-es), we acknowledge that giving up meat for even one day a week makes a significant impact on the environment. 
As one of the leading causes, according to the World 
Bank, of Amazon deforestation and air and water pollution, Gators can now join the fast-moving international movement to reduce, or at least slow, the environmental destruction the meat industry causes across the globe. 
And we don’t think one day per week is too much to ask.
And who knows — maybe the tofu will grow on you.Eat Les Chikin

aired Wednesday on “The El-len Show,” Justin Bieber, our favorite “Baby Lady”-croon-ing, surfer-haired heartthrob, talked about how even he is bullied for his high-pitched voice and lack of body hair.
Citing comments on his 
battle-for-top-popularity-with-Gaga-herself YouTube page like, “Look at him; he puts helium in his voice be-fore he sings,” we can’t help but smile with The Bieber and 
his don’t-let-it-get-me-down 
attitude against bullying.
We just hope Bieber hasn’t 
seen the website where people upload photos of gay women who look remarkably like him. That might be too much.
Lending his support to the 
nationwide “It Gets Better” campaign to target bullying, which prompted President Barack Obama to make his own video against bullying, Bieber’s message about not letting the teasing and taunts about his lack of chest hair at age 16 get to him speaks vol-umes about the larger issue.
Whether it be taunting or 
teasing for not having enough testosterone to grow a lumber -
jack-quality beard, for being overweight, for being black or white, gay or straight, or just generally different, we’re happy to see so many celebri-ties and important figures ad-
dress the issue that results in 
so much harm and often goes unnoticed.
And the opportunity to 
change the way we look at others, to change the way we treat others, just might lie in Justin Bieber.
It Gets Better, Justin. We 
promise.MONDAY, NOVEMBER 8, 2010 � ALLIGATOR, 7
UF not setting a good business example
Block tuition is not only foolish, but it’s also un-
realistic. 
Block tuition will hurt students financially and 
academically. Someone in my position as an engi-
neer at UF who pays his way through   college will 
have to deal with the question of whether I want to 
get overcharged or have lower grades. 
Any engineering major at this school knows 
what taking 15 credits is like, especially when the 
average grades are only in the B+ range if you’re 
lucky! 
This proposal would require students to either 
graduate at their own pace and be grossly over -
charged or take an overwhelming number of class-
es each semester while undoubtedly getting lower 
grades, which benefits no one.
It’s ridiculous I worked diligently through high 
school and college to ensure my tuition could be paid for, and now with “100 percent” Bright Fu-
tures, I still end up paying a quarter of my tuition. 
So if UF really wants to institute a block tuition, 
maybe it should change the per-credit prices to off-
set it. 
Why should I be required to pay for something 
I don’t use? Is this what UF is trying to set as an example of good business?

Rights Should Be Protected, Not Attacked
I am disappointed The Editorial Board worried 
about a setback to the gay rights movement and gun control in the same sentence. On one hand, The Editorial Board wants to grant more rights, yet 
on the other it wants to take rights away.  Did you 
know Florida is actually a state where concealed carry has been legal since 1988? In all that time, only 0.02 percent of carry permits have been re-voked. That means 99.98 percent of permit holders have been perfectly good, law-abiding citizens.  
Carry permit holders are actually 13.5 times less 
likely than the general population to be arrested for a nonviolent crime, probably because they choose to be responsible and know the laws.
Did you also know Colorado State University 
has allowed concealed carry on its campus since 2003? Not only has it had zero incidents with this, its crime rate has dropped by 60 percent in the past four years.  
On the other hand, the University of Colorado’s 
crime rate has actually risen by 35 percent in the same time period. This university does not allow concealed firearms.
I support gay rights because I support freedom 
in general. I would consider myself a hypocrite if I worked to grant certain people rights and at the same time fought to take them away from others.  
There is actually a gun-rights organization 
called the Pink Pistols that advocates for the rights of gays specifically to bear arms, as carrying guns is the most effective way to protect people from prejudiced, hateful individuals who may violently attack someone based, in this case, on their orienta-tion.  You can check them out at www.pinkpistols.org.

read “Reuben’s Art Will Make 
You Laugh.”
Wilkerson said his art is in-
spired by the funny things he sees in everyday life. 
He still works at GE but 
sketches his ideas on a sheet 
of paper during his 30-minute 
lunch break.
“I’m as surprised as every-
body else when it comes out,” Wilkerson said. “Once I reach 
a point where I think I should 
stop, that’s when I stop. I’m pleasantly surprised for the most part.”
More than 600 artists applied 
to participate in Gainesville’s 
29th Annual Downtown Festival 
and Art Show. About 100,000 people attended the festival, ac-cording to Linda Piper, events 
coordinator for the festival.
Piper said the festival seeks 
to support local artists. During 
the selection process, judges add an extra point to the score 
of artists from Florida and two 
extra points to the score of art-ists from Gainesville.
“It has a reputation to be a 
very festive event,” Piper said. “The entire community supports this event and looks forward to it, and because it’s a holiday sea-son, it’s a great opportunity to purchase artwork as gifts.”
Emily Eckhart, 25, bought 
a Christmas ornament for her mom. Eckhart is a self-pro-
claimed festival junkie. 
“I just love festivals of any 
kind,” she said. “I like being 
with people, and you always see 
people you know. And, come 
on, you can’t beat fair food.”
Eckhart wasn’t alone in en-joying the fried food. Culinary 
arts were visible in every part of 
the festival. Children and adults alike wandered from booth to booth, holding snow cones, 
fresh-squeezed lemonade, kettle 
corn and funnel cakes. 
Wilkerson said he realized 10 
years ago how much he needed art in his life.
“I realize art is something 
you can’t live without,” he said. “I hope (the customers) feel the same way.”8, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, NOVEMBER 8, 2010

There was only one con-
test left. Strength and agility 
wouldn’t help them now. It was 
last for a reason.
Hands behind their backs, 
kneeling on the grass, eight stu-
dents plunged their mouths into the metal pans filled with pump-
kin pie. 
The pie-eating contest was 
one of 12 contests held during 
the UF Big Olympics on Sunday afternoon at Norman Field.
Students for Big Brothers Big 
Sisters hosted the competition to see which student organization is most involved in the commu-
nity. 
About 50 students on eight 
teams from seven different orga-
nizations competed. 
Phi Delta Theta, which had 
two teams because it had so many members who wanted to participate, won the competi-tion.The Jamaican-American Stu-
dent Association, Mortar Board, the Speech and Debate Team, Caribbean Students Association and Faces Modeling Troupe also competed in the event. 
The Jamaican-American Stu-
dent Association donated more than 100 toys, which will be given to youth at the Big Broth-ers Big Sisters Holiday Party on Dec. 11. Overall, $105 was raised by the eight competing teams. 
John Bonacci, CEO of Big 
Brothers Big Sis-
ters of Mid-Flori-
da, said he hoped the competition 
would increase community awareness of the organization and actively engage the Student Body.
Multiple UF student organi-
zations had contacted him about 
getting involved with Big Broth-
ers Big Sisters.
“We didn’t have the resourc-
es to have one activity for each organization, so we brought them together,” he said.Students compete

GATORS IN THE NFL alligatorSports.org TEEING OFF WITH TYLER JETTBy JESSE SIMONTON
Alligator Writer
 
Ten days ago, No. 7 Florida de-
feated No. 20 South Carolina 1-0 
on a swerving free kick from se-
nior defender Nicky Kit. On Sun-day, it was Kit’s simple cross right at a Gamecocks defender that did the trick.
For the first time since 2007, 
the Gators (18-2-2, 12-1-1 South-eastern Conference) won the SEC Tournament with a 1-0 victory 
courtesy of an own goal by de-
fending tournament champion South Carolina. 
After defeating the Gamecocks 
10 days earlier for their fifth con-
secutive regular-season crown, 
the Gators won a physical game by matching South Carolina’s defensive discipline, maintaining 
possession and waiting for their 
opportunities. 
“I’m so excited to win again,” 
senior defender Ashlee Elliott said. “It was an amazing feeling 
[to hold the trophy again]. I’ve 
worked my butt off to get back to here and this is what I came back for.”
Said coach Becky Burleigh: “It was something that our team set 
as a goal at the end of last year, 
and it’s just exciting to achieve it.”
Elliott, along with SEC De-
fensive Player of the Year Kat Williamson and first-time starter Brooke Chancey, kept the Game-cocks off the scoreboard by ha-
rassing SEC Offensive Player of 
the Year Kayla Grimsley. 
Chancey, filling in for the in-
jured Katie Fraine, wasn’t fazed 
by the pressure and blocked sev-
eral early shots, giving herself and the team confidence. The junior goalie said she was 
on cloud nine when the game started but admitted jitters were also in play. 
“I was really nervous,” she 
said. “But I got my mind right, got focused and played a solid game.”
Midway through the second 
half, Chancey swung the mo-mentum of the game when she challenged Grimsley on a brutal one-on-one. On a high-bouncing long ball, Chancey and Grimsley 
collided at the top of the box, but 
Chancey held onto the ball and Grimsley was carded for the reck-less challenge.
“That was an adrenaline high,” 
Chancey said. “I was so excited. It’s good to have a one-on-one and win it, especially against her because she’s a little arrogant and 
we love to take it to her.”
Despite a sluggish first half, the 
Gators came out firing after inter -
mission and nearly scored three 
or four goals, but All-Tournament 
goalie Mollie Patton made several 
key saves to preserve the shutout. 
But after knocking on the 
door all afternoon, Florida finally 
caught a break when Kit’s cross 
from the left sideline bounced off a defender’s leg and into the goal. 
“The first half we didn’t play 
our style and maybe we were just a little uptight because it was a championship match,” Burleigh said. “But the second half we 
settled down and really started to 
take it too them. We put a lot of pressure on them, and they prob-ably were fortunate to not have more than one go in.”Florida wins SEC Tournament for first time since 2007

NASHVILLE, Tenn. — The first pass 
of Jordan Reed’s career was also his first 
throw of the day.
Florida’s tight end didn’t warm up 
his arm at all Saturday before unleashing a 31-yard touchdown strike to Deonte Thompson in the second quarter, a fact 
that even surprised Reed.
“No, I … yea, it was the first time (I 
threw the ball),” Reed said.
That turned out to be the first of many 
throws for Reed, as he joined the Gators’ 
rotation at quarterback in a 55-14 win against Vanderbilt.
Reed went 11 of 19 for 120 yards, a 
touchdown and an interception, and he ran the offense for the entire second half. 
By comparison, starter John Brantley was 
11 of 18 for 157 yards and two scores and Trey Burton did not attempt a pass.
Reed’s toss to Thompson came on a 
play that was Tim Tebow’s 
bread and butter at Flori-
da: the rocker step.
He took the shotgun 
snap, faked a run up the 
middle and then rocked 
backward before launching a dart to 
Thompson in the back-left corner of the end zone. 
It was Thompson’s first score of the 
season and UF’s first touchdown pass since Sept. 25.Reed impresses with 
arm, legs as quarterbackNASHVILLE, Tenn. — Football 
finally became fun again.
After weeks of using su-
perior athletes — the “top-1 percent of the top-1 percent” — in a three-yards-and-a-cloud-of-dust offense, the Gators looked like the team you hoped to see 
all season. 
They rotated quarterbacks without a 
trend. They stuck with a fast-paced style 
even when it didn’t work early. And they got a little crazy, pulling off the 
rare “running-quarterback-flip-back-to-
the-passing-quarterback” flea flicker.
Vanderbilt looked confused. Or 
maybe they just looked like Vanderbilt. After all, the Gators have beaten the 
Commodores 18 times in a row, the last six by a combined 
score of 226-117.
And, really, 
both of Florida’s wins since imple-menting the high-octane, huddles-
are-for-clowns 
offense have come against underwhelming 
competition. 
But Saturday we finally get to see if 
the Gators can do what nobody thought possible three weeks ago: punch a ticket to the SEC Championship Game on the strength of their offense.New offense will be tested

� At the rate Vanderbilt’s program is going, coach Robbie Caldwell will only
need about 1,800 games to join Joe Paterno in the 400-win club. If the Commo -
dores keep playing 12 games a year, Caldwell will hit the mark in 150 seasons.

� Minnesota Vikings wide receiver Percy 
Harvin caught nine passes for 126 yards in a win Sunday. Also, New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez racked up the first two receiving touchdowns of his career.“He’s been practicing re-
ally hard, and it showed today,” 
Brantley said. “He did a great job 
running the ball and throwing 
the ball. That’s what’s impres-sive about him, because he never warmed up his arm or anything, 
so for him to come out here and 
do that is awesome.”
Reed added a game-high 84 
rushing yards and a touchdown on 16 carries, making him the 
first UF player with a touchdown 
passing and rushing in a game this season. Tebow did that nine times in 2009, and Auburn quar -
terback Cam Newton — who transferred from Florida — has four such games this year.
Reed still has a ways to go as 
far as polishing his game, but the 
6-foot-3, 240-pounder is the clos-
est thing the Gators have to New-ton. 
Reed’s seven-yard carry on 
4th-and-1 set up Brantley’s first touchdown, and he added runs of 22, 12 and 16 yards in the third quarter.
He’s also the first UF player to 
run, throw and make a catch for a touchdown in a season since An-dre Caldwell in 2006.
Rainey makes impact again: 
Chris Rainey’s return to the back-field helped spark Florida’s of-fense last week. This week, he was a game-changer on special teams.
Rainey blocked two punts 
against Vanderbilt, dashing around the edge both times to get a hand on the ball. 
The first set up a three-yard 
drive for the game’s first score, and the second was returned for 
a touchdown.
“You talk about a momentum 
shift,” Meyer said. “Rainey is one 
of the very unique skilled ath-
letes who can come off an edge 
that skinny like that.”
Those two blocks gave Rainey 
four for his career, tied for the most in school history.
He had just eight yards on 
three carries, but he snagged a 40-yard touchdown pass on a flea flicker from Brantley, catching 
the underthrown ball in coverage 
in the end zone.
Rainey missed five games this 
season due to suspension, and he 
has not been made available for com-
ment since his return. A UF spokes-man said Rainey declined to speak with the media, only saying, “I’m thankful for my opportunities.”
The man who gave him a second 
chance is happy with Rainey’s prog-ress.
“I think he hit rock bottom and 
had one way to go,” Meyer said. “Good for him. Even beyond foot-ball, he’s doing much better in school. My thumb is on him real hard, so his whole work ethic has 
changed.”
Etc.: Meyer said freshman defen-
sive tackle Dominique Easley was not part of UF’s travel roster for “a 
lot of reasons.” … Cornerback Mo-ses Jenkins played Saturday for the first time since the season opener. The Coral Springs native had been 
out with an elbow injury.14, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, NOVEMBER 8, 2010

Chris 
RaineyThe quarterback-turned-tight-end-
turned-quarterback reminded Gators fans how fun watching a signal caller who can throw and run is. Reed’s  first-quarter touchdown to Deonte Thompson came after he initially faked a run up the middle, fooling the Vanderbilt defensive backs.
11 for 19 passing, 120 yards, 1 TD, 
1 INT; 16 carries, 84 yards, 1 TDOne of the keys to Florida’s 
improved play has been the return of threats to run outside — Rainey and Gillislee. Returning from a hamstring injury, Gillislee scored a pair of touchdowns Saturday, both of which came while running off the left edge. His first score came two plays after Rainey’s punt block, and his second touchdown came in the third quarter against an already broken Vanderbilt defense.

When Rainey returned two weeks ago, 
few people, if any, were excited about the boost he would bring to the punt return team. But when Florida’s offense struggled early Saturday, Rainey jump started the unit by giving it great field 
position with a first-quarter punt block that set the Gators up 3 yards from the end zone. His second block led directly to a touchdown when freshman Solomon Patton scooped the ball and bolted untouched down field.

Urban Meyer
UF football coachMONDAY, NOVEMBER 8, 2010 � ALLIGATOR, 15
Gators to face Gamecocks for chance to play in SEC Championship
back draped all over him to put UF up 21-
0.
“Like I told you all last week and I’ve 
told you all year long, he’s the best player 
on our team,” senior Mike Pouncey said. 
“He shows it week in and week out, and we’re just glad to have him back.”
Florida also received some unexpected 
help in the shotgun from Jordan Reed, who threw a career-high 19 passes Saturday. On his first pass of the game, he rocked for -
ward as if he was going to run the ball, then 
quickly dropped back and threw a 31-yard 
strike to Deonte Thompson in the end zone. The Gators had not thrown a touchdown pass in the previous four games.
“[Reed is] a freak athlete,” Meyer said. 
“You can see what a dynamic runner he is. 
He’s got a nice arm. But we don’t have that 
big runner, and he gives us that.”
Usual UF wildcat quarterback Trey Bur -
ton ran the ball just six times against Van-derbilt compared to Reed’s 16 rushes for a 
team-high 84 yards. But Meyer shot down 
the notion that Reed would 
cut into Burton’s playing 
time.
The Gators’ 34 points 
in the second quarter were 
more than they scored in 
four whole games this season, and 41 first-
half points were their most since playing Charleston Southern last season.
It was more than enough as the defense held Vanderbilt to 109 total yards and put up a touchdown of its own on a 45-yard fumble return from defensive tackle Terron 
Sanders.
The Gators have strung together two 
wins since stumbling into a three-game los-
ing streak. Now UF has just one more thing 
it has to do before earning a trip to Atlanta: 
beat South Carolina.
“I like the look. … It’s real clear what the 
focus is,” Meyer said. “It’s championship week in Gainesville.”Football , from page 1
While South Carolina looked far 
from a powerhouse in its 41-20 loss 
to Arkansas, this is the same team 
that snapped Alabama’s 19-game 
win streak last month. You remem-
ber the Crimson Tide, the team that 
beat the Gators by 25 on Oct. 2?
Saturday’s game against the Ol’ 
Ball Coach won’t provide Florida 
fans with a direct comparison be-tween their team’s offense before and after its seemingly pivotal bye week. But a win will indicate the Gators have taken positive steps.  
And a loss? Well, beating up on 
the Commodores and the neutered Bulldogs was really just smoke and mirrors.
In the preseason, coaches talked 
about building a post-Tebow of-
fense, about how the team would 
operate without one of the greatest college football players ever. And, as odd as it sounds, you were prob-
ably kind of excited.
Without Superman to lean on, 
the Florida offense would spread the ball around. Remember all 
those other four- and five-star skill players? 
But through Florida’s first seven 
games, the offense was creative-ly stagnant, as if coaches forgot what it was like to spread the ball around. 
Jeff Demps has yet to return to 
form since suffering a foot injury against Tennessee, when he was given a career-high 26 carries. And 
Florida found itself digging out of 
a hole after its first drive against Alabama, when the Tide stopped Trey Burton on three straight plays at the goal line.
Through the first half of the sea-
son, the 4-3 Gators ranked 65th in scoring offense and 91st in yards per game. 
But, man, they could have fooled 
you Saturday. Jordan Reed pound-
ed the middle. Mike Gillislee blew 
past the defense off the edge. And Frankie Hammond scored a 39-yard touchdown after swerving in 
and out of the Vanderbilt defense 
like … well, let’s not go there.
Sure, the Commodores are re-ally bad. Moses Jenkins even asked a photographer if he could get a postgame picture with a Vander -
bilt player … in the third quarter.
Still, the Gators have gained 930 
yards in two games. That’s good for about 150 more yards than Flor -
ida averaged against Miami (Ohio), 
South Florida and a 3-6 Tennessee 
team. 
So the Gators are only thriving 
against mediocre competition. At 
least they’re thriving. 
Now, can they do it in their big-
gest game of the season?
