Pennsylvania man tells thief he’s homeless, gets stuff back
YORK, Pa. — Police say an armed rob-
ber gave back everything he stole from a 
homeless man after learning he lives at a shelter.
 The York Dispatch reported on Thurs-
day that the 22-year-old suspect,  Larry Sanderson, was outside the York Rescue Mission on Wednesday night when a man displayed the handle of a revolver and told him to empty his pockets.The paper said Sanderson turned 
over his wallet, cell phone, MP3 player and cigarettes.
When the armed man asked Sander -
son if that was all he had, Sanderson ex-plained he lives at the shelter.
Police say the robber replied, “I can 
respect that,” returned the man’s prop-erty and walked away.

Gainesville’s newest hospital is home to 12 custom surgical 
suites, a state-of-the-art cancer center and one of the only inter -
ventional cardiology facilities in the nation, but the doctors won’t 
be treating you there. They’ll care for your pets. 
It is the only small-animal hospital of its kind, and it belongs to 
the UF College of Veterinary Medicine.
The new hospital will have a grand opening event open to the 
public on Sunday from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. It will begin accepting 
patients Nov. 1.
Paid for by state funding and private donors, this three-story , 
100,000-square-foot, $58 million hospital features everything from 
arthroscopy to acupuncture.  
According to the hospital’s fact sheet, the new facility provides 
22 examination rooms, larger treatment areas, 24-hour emergency care and an intensive care unit.
According to Glen F. Hoffsis, dean of the UF Veterinary Col-
lege, the most notable improvements over the current small-ani-mal hospital are the increased space for patient care and ability to 
teach veterinary students. Veterinary college

Fresh from taping the season finale 
of “Jersey Shore” and going to Dis-
ney World on Thursday , according to his Twitter, DJ Pauly D will be in Gainesville tonight.
Paul “Pauly D” Delvecchio, of 
MTV’s “Jersey Shore,” had to postpone his show at The Venue Nightclub and Lounge from Wednesday night until today at The Vault NightClub due to scheduling conflicts with early morn-ing tapings to promote “Jersey Shore.”
Joe V elocci, assistant to Michael 
Schweiger, Delvecchio’s manager/agent, said that “Friday just worked 
better.”
When Pauly D changed dates, he had to change the venue, too. 
V elocci said he did not know why 
there was a venue change from The 
V enue to The Vault. 
Kevin Rupkey , a co-owner of The 
Vault, said the change had to do with 
more scheduling 
issues. The V enue 
already had Bone Thugs-n-Harmony planned for Fri-day night so The 
Vault, right across the street from The V enue, was the next choice.
Rupkey said that any tickets bought 
for the show prior to venue change will be accepted. Tickets are still available  for $30 at The Vault or online.Pauly postpones show � PRICES RANGE FROM 25 CENTS

To prepare for the weekend’s Friends of the 
Library fall book sale, volunteers Ron Beau-
champ and Peter Levine are finishing up orga-
nizing the music corner, complete with records, 
eight-track tapes and cassettes. 
The Friends of the Library Book Sale, at 
430-B N. Main St., occurs twice a year to raise money for the Alachua County Library District so it can purchase more land for its library sys-tems, fund its bookmobile projects and provide scholarships to long-time library employees who wish to earn college degrees, explained 
Jim Dahlman, a volunteer.
The fall sale will begin at 9 a.m. Saturday 
and will last until Wednesday. Prices range 
from 25 cents to $4.  All the items on sale were donated, and the number of this year’s dona-tions has exceeded that of previous years.
“If we had any more, we wouldn’t have any 
room to put it,” Dahlman said. 
Currently , the 75-foot–wide, 150-foot-long 
warehouse has about 500,000 items divided into 40 categories, including books, music, movies, artwork, posters, magazines and puzzles. 
Levine, the organization’s vice president, 
said people start lining up on Friday night and 
by Saturday morning, the line snakes through 
the parking lot and contin-
ues down Main Street. 
“It’s kind of a controlled 
chaos in the first 15 minutes we‘re open,” he added. 
In the first half hour, 500 to 700 people are 
expected to come in, led by a bagpiper in an attempt to keep things orderly . 
The sale also includes a collector’s corner 
where first-edition books, novels signed by the author and a set of five watercolor paintings by Jessica Rockwell will be sold at prices higher than the rest of the items. For more information visit http://folacld.org/.Book sale to kick off

Couple sue after Mega Death 
sauce hospitalizes son
CLEVELAND, Tenn. (AP) — 
Some don’t like it hot. A Steak ‘n Shake restaurant in Cleve-
land, Tenn., was sued by a cou-
ple who claimed it served a hot sauce that sent their son to the hospital.
Tim and Mary Katherine 
Gann said a restaurant server gave their minor child a bottle of Blair’s Mega Death Sauce for his chili and encouraged him to 
eat some. When he did, he broke 
out in hives, had trouble breath-ing and suffered severe pain.
The brand isn’t customarily 
served by the chain, according to the Cleveland Daily Banner. Mega Death’s maker warns that it’s “500 times hotter than a ja-lapeno.”
A spokeswoman for fran-
chise owner Debbie Richmond said Thursday the company wasn’t commenting.
The lawsuit seeks $10,000 in 
compensation and $50,000 pu-nitive damages.

� THE MEAT MARKET 
OFFERS LOWER PRICES.
By BETHANY KOCH
Alligator Contributing Writer
The UF Meat Market is 
chopping prices on  fresh 
flesh.
The market, located in the 
Animal Sciences building be-
hind the UF veterinary school, is open on Fridays from 9 a.m. 
to 5 p.m.
At the market, you’ll find 
a variety of cuts from locally 
raised beef and pork with the occasional chicken eggs or 
lamb. 
In general, the meat is about 
$2 per pound cheaper than the 
grocery store, so pork chops that may cost $4.30 are sold at 
the UF market for $2.60. 
Byron Davis, the manger of 
the market who has been work-
ing there since 1997, said that the animals are used in five or six different classes in the animal science program before they are butchered. The classes range from raising the animals to meat processing. 
The animals are also used 
for two different meat-judging 
teams and one livestock-judg-
ing team in inter-collegiate 
competitions.  
Davis said the market gets 
about 85 to 100 customers on 
an average Friday. Fifty to 60 
percent of those customers are 
students. 
Due to a no-competition 
clause because of its not-for-
profit status at UF, the only 
way people hear about the market is by word-of-mouth. 
UF meat is locally  raised, 
butchered, produced and pro-
cessed.
“I’d say it’s fresher,” Davis 
said. “The pork in the case to-day was walking around less than a week ago.” 
The beef you buy at the UF 
meat market also has a unique flavor because they dry-age all cuts for a minimum of 10 days. 
“Nobody dry-ages whole 
carcasses anymore. They might dry-age cuts, and even then it’s only going to be at your high-end, white-tablecloth restau-rants,” Davis said. “There, a steak is going to cost you $50 to $60, and we do it here for nothing.”
As for how this meat-man 
eats his steaks: “Minimum seasoning, just salt and course ground pepper,” Davis said. “Hot charcoal grill, medium to medium rare. I want to taste the meat, not what I put on it.”Beef bonanza hits campus

Objects in Motion, UF’s jug-

Florida Museum of Natural His-tory’s ButterflyFest on Saturday at 1:30 p.m.  
Rachel Greiner, the museum’s 
education assistant, said the per -
formers are another interesting component that enhances Butter -
flyFest.
“We wanna share something 
we’re really passionate about and get to know people in a different way other than talking,” said Ni-
cole Rowsey, the performance co-
ordinator. 
Ian Elsner, the president of Objects in Motion, has been jug-gling since he was 6 years old and thinks of juggling as a conversa-
tion. The club will teach the au-
dience how to juggle, as well as put on a performance  juggling clubs and balls and staff spin-
ning, which is spinning a lengthy 
wooden stick in circular motions. 
With the help of four choreog-
raphers, the club plans to have an ar -
tistic and polished performance.
“We are much more organized 
for [this] performance than we 
were last year, and that makes 
everything from the rehearsals to the actual show better,” Elsner said.Juggling club to share

� THE BUS WAS BEHIND 
MARSTON SCIENCE LIBRARY. 
By MINA RADMAN
Alligator Writer 
Students walking along Newell 
Drive on Thursday may have no-
ticed an unusual vehicle parked 
behind Marston Science Library. 
The CNN Election Express bus, 
the mobile bureau for the news network, stayed on campus until 4 
p.m. T.J. Holmes, a weekend news 
anchor for CNN, asked students to give their views on the economy and the upcoming midterm elec-
tions.
“We’re seeing that students 
aren’t very engaged in the elec-
tions, but maybe that will change as it gets closer,” said producer 
Josh Rubin.
Rubin noted how the UF Col-
lege Democrats and Republicans were disgruntled that students 
have not paid much attention to the election season. Rubin attrib -
uted this to students being focused 
on their personal matters. 
This was the first time the Ex-
press has visited UF. The bus re-
mains moving year-round, visiting a variety of cities, towns and col-lege campuses, often carrying can-
didates to debates.
The bus will be traveling to 
Tampa on Sunday for the Senate 
and governor’s debate being held at the University of South Florida. CNN bus parks on campus as part of election tour

Amelia Harris just isn’t herself today.“Today is going to be different,” she says. “I warned 
you.”
She sits on the scuffed black floor, calmly addressing 
the eager actors circled around her during their prere-hearsal check-in. 
“I just want to say that I might not appear to be the 
same person as I was yesterday, but I am. I am the same person,” she assures them. She acts serious, but the quiet laughter of her cast tells a different story. “There will be times for fun and joy, and there will be times for work and 
focus. And today is entirely work and focus.”
Harris, 25, is the director of “Robots vs. Fake Robots,” 
a play by David Largman Murray. The play is part of the 
Florida Players’ season, which kicks off today with the premiere of “Robots.”  
This fall, she is the only female directing one of the 
three shows funded through the Student Government-supported theater group. Although that’s a fairly atypical statistic at UF, where female-directed shows nearly equal 
the number of male-directed shows, according to the Flor -
ida Players website, it’s all-too-common elsewhere in the 
theater world.
“My first experience with the Florida Players was with 
a female director, and working on ‘Robots’ the first time, as an actor, I was directed by a woman,” she said. “It 
didn’t strike me, but aside from those two experiences, out of … it must be something like 20 to 30 experiences with directors, 
those were the only females.”
“Robots” is a play about superficiality and the quest for 
physical beauty and perfection, which is a quest women 
are on more than men, Harris said.  “So telling the story 
of ‘Robots,’ I have referenced the struggle women have 
in this country that is maybe harder than [that of] men,” she said.
While discussing robots with her cast, they referenced 
certain stereotypes that they used for inspiration in play-
ing robots. They’re shallow and emotionless.
“In the end, the robots are the ugliest, craziest, most 
heartless things you’ve ever seen,” she says. “This whole time, you could relate those stereotypes to these robots.”
Harris attended the University of California in Santa 
Barbara, where she studied playwriting with the play-
wright of “Robots.” 
In the play, which takes place in the year 6000, Earth 
is a post-apocalyptic, bleak environment. Joe and Sammie are two humans caught in a tale of unrequited love during 
a time when robots rule the earth and call remaining hu-
mans “peetles.” Joe desires to become a robot and leaves Sammie to chase his dream, and the play documents his journey going underground to attempt this transforma-
tion. 
“They’re fighters,” Harris says. “They’re tough. They’re 
the cockroaches of human beings, in a good way. They’re 
resilient, and they know how to work hard for what they want.” 
Harris explained that if the robots smell a human, they 
will tear him to pieces. 
“That’s how they are sexually aroused,” she says. She 
rushes off to apply makeup before rehearsals begin, dodg-
ing a gaggle of chattering theater students and random 
individuals doing vocal warm-ups.
Harris may claim not to be herself today, but she’s do-
ing a terrible job at being anything but.Director looks forward to ‘Robots vs. Fake Robots’“We’re seeing that         
students aren’t very

but maybe that will change 
as it gets closer.”

� HE TALKED TO YOUNG VOTERS 
ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF VOTING.
By JERRY BRUNO
Alligator Contributing Writer
With an election looming around the cor -
ner, U.S. Senate candidate Kendrick Meek 
swung by UF on Thursday to bolster sup-port from young voters.
Meek, who is challenging Republican 
Marco Rubio and independent Charlie Crist,  spoke to a crowd of about 40 people on Thursday in Reitz Union Room 282 about 
the importance of getting yourself and oth-
ers to the polls.
“To think that Marco Rubio and Rick 
Scott will be top officials in Florida is dan-gerous,” Meek said. “It has me wake up in 
the middle of the night asking myself, ‘What 
can I do?’” 
Currently, Meek trails Rubio and Crist in 
the polls with the election slated for Nov. 2. 
“That is always a concern,” Meek said of 
his low poll numbers. “But that is why it’s important to get progressives and moder -
ates excited and to the polls.” Kristin Klein, president of UF College 
Democrats, believes that of the three candi-dates in the Senate election, Meek presents the best choice.
“To simply put it, you can trust him and 
you can rely on him, ” Klein said. “He has always been a consistent voter, and he has never wavered on his principles.” 
Jon Reiskind, chairman of the Alachua 
County Democrats, affirmed his support for 
Meek.  
“Kendrick Meek has 
been a consistent voice for banning drilling off Flori-
da’s shores, for a woman’s reproductive rights, for protecting Social Security and Medicare,” Reiskind 
said.
Jasmine Gomez, a sec-
ond-year political science major, said that 
while she supports Meek, she is worried about the election. 
“Although I completely support Ken-
drick Meek, the unfortunate reality in a conservative state like Florida is it is nearly impossible for a hugely left-wing liberal to 
win,” Gomez said. Meek stops on campus

At the 2010 Gator Global Initiative, 
students will learn more about leaving 
a positive mark on the world. 
The event will take place today and 
Saturday in Pugh Hall and will edu-
cate students and organizations about 
social issues. 
The Gator Global Initiative was 
started two years ago by Mary Kay 
Carodine, the assistant vice president 
for student affairs. The conference was 
modeled after Bill Clinton’s Global Ini-
tiative University and focuses on glob-
al health, energy and climate change/
sustainability, poverty alleviation and 
education. 
“Every career is in some way con-
nected to these issues,” Carodine said. “The Gator Global Initiative will help 
students become global citizens and 
more marketable in their careers.”
The goal of the conference is to give 
students the resources they need to take on social issues that plague soci-
ety on a local and global scale.
Carodine said students will attend 
skill sessions to learn about focusing 
their passions, partnering with non-profits, creating a business plan and 
funding a project.Gator Global Initiative

130 TOTAL VOTES74% YES26% NOThursday’s question: Do you feel accepted at UF?The anti-hero of our times – fo’ real
The word “inspiration” is usually thrown into the 
ring when discussing influential politicians, suc-cessful singers and recognized authors. These 
choice individuals typically inspire others to follow in their footsteps and make a path similar to their own. Well, obviously, when I think of inspiration only one person comes to mind: Antoine Dodson.
If you have no idea who he is, then “you are so 
dumb.” Fo’ real. 
So just in case, here’s a quick summary: His sister 
was almost raped by some idiot in the projects. He was then interviewed by a local news station, became a You-
Tube sensation and subsequently got a hit Internet song 
out of people mocking him.
Although the mystery of the notorious Lincoln Park 
rapist was never solved, Dodson’s interview was auto-
tuned and released into the Internet and made Dodson 
an unintentional star.
Fast forward a few months and Dodson has emerged 
from the projects. After selling 100,000 copies of his hit song titled “Bed Intruder,” he bought his family a better 
home outside of the Alabama projects. 
Not only did he rescue his sister from a rapist, but he 
also became an Internet superstar, sold enough songs to 
enter the Billboards chart, bought a new house and is 
putting himself back through school.
Now that’s inspiration. And inspiration that came 
from his sister almost being raped. 
I’m not advising anyone get in front of a camera and 
act a fool. But then again, Antoine’s blatant first-grade vocabulary made it possible for him to attend the BET 
Hip-Hop Awards and perform in front of established hip-hop artists.His courage is inspirational.So instead of looking for in-
spiration in the typical celebri-ties, I look toward Dodson. His 
interview and his ensuing suc-
cess taught me to hide my kids, my wife and my husband. Not only have his words of wisdom created a successful music ca-
reer — he’s also a philanthropic entrepreneur attempt-ing to start a foundation for juvenile diabetes. 
When was the last time you saw Lindsay Lohan do 
that?
His website features everything from T-shirts to cof-
fee mugs and my all-time favorite: the Bed Intruder cos-tume. 
This simple getup is a black tank, afro wig, and red 
bandana. The perfect Halloween costume.
So you can run and tell that to all your friends.Dodson is inspiration at its very finest. Although 
some might consider his climb to fame a bit silly and undeserved, he has made the best out of his 15 minutes 
of fame. 
Unlike his pop culture predecessors (see: Kate Gos-
selin), Dodson has used his fame for the good of his 
family. 
His words resonate higher and higher with each You-
Tube play. So next time you’re looking to be inspired, look no further than a simple video named “The Bed Intruder Song.” Fo’ real.
Hassan Casanova is a third-year family, youth and com-
munity science student at Santa Fe College. His column appears every Friday.As we approach our fourth consecutive weekend that will 
not produce a Gators football win and blissfully approach 
the orange-and-black-draped pseudo holiday that makes it OK to be nearly naked, we can’t help but wonder where all this time has gone. 
There’s only a little more than four weeks until Thanks-
giving break, which really begins the Friday before Thanks-giving for most of us, and only about six weeks until the end of classes.
It seems like just yesterday we were gladly risking mela-
noma in the sands across our state in our desire to have a Snooki-matching skin tone. The semester’s moved by so quickly we’re caught awkwardly singing along to a one-per -
son duet of “Summer Lovin’.”
And we don’t even care. Because when it’s still 85 degrees 
outside, we’ll sing whatever we want and we’ll still decorate our houses with pumpkins and spider webs in our makeshift season. 
So in our attempts to make sense of what time of the year 
it is anymore with our textbooks creating a dizzying disas -
ter of scribbled notes, the Department of Darts and Laurels presents you with your very own We’ve-Got-On-Our-Bikini-Tops-To-Class-But-We-Have-Our-Sweaters-For-The-Nights-Because-It’s-Clearly-The-Season-Of-Fummer-In-Florida edi-tion of…
Darts & Laurels
That’s right. Fummer. It’s that uniquely Floridian cross-
breed between fall and summer when the high is often 40 degrees different than the low. 
Oh, and speaking of low points, the Alligator took one be-
low the belt at Gator Growl in front of thousands on Friday.
And while not many of us wanted to spend the money 
for a ticket to the pep rally event that has been described as the worst yet by many, we realize how hard these organiz-ers must have worked to create jokes about the newspaper, which they’re obviously reading right now, that no one really thought were that funny.
So, for first being hypocrites for using our beacon of news 
to wipe your rear, but wait, still read it; and second, just for not knowing how to be funny, we’re throwing a Better-Luck-Next-Year-In-Actually-Making-Gator-Growl-An-Event-Most-Students-Want-To-Go-To DART at the Gator Growl 
producers. 
But we’re not name-calling anymore. We’ve seen what 
that kind of behavior can do. And Wednesday, we’ve seen how we can stick together against bullying. An estimated 1.4 million people wore purple Wednesday as a sign of unity against the bullying of gay teens and to honor the recent gay teens who took their own lives because of it.
We’re so proud of you, Gators. We’ve never known so 
many shades of purple. For sticking up for what’s good and just, we’re handing you a We’re-So-Thankful-So-Many-Of-You-Care LAUREL  to those who united against bullying . 
And unity is apparently a popular concept recently as a 
fast-food staple is trying to unionize its members.
Jimmy John’s employees will vote today on whether they 
want unionization in an industry that regularly pays its workers minimum wage while working horrendous hours for people who don’t appreciate them. 
And while unionization and fast food go together almost 
as well as oil and vinegar, we’re glad to see some fast food employees stick up for what’s right. 
So, here’s a Make-Us-A-Sandwich-Because-You’re-Get-
ting-Benefits-Now LAUREL  to Jimmy John’s employees.
That’s all for now, Gators. And remember, this is not toilet 
paper.

My intention behind saying we are still an 
“old Southern school” was not to refer to the 
political milieu within or surrounding the 
Gainesville area. 
Rather, my intention was to refer to the history of 
our university with the cultural segregation that re-
mains within groups on campus.
In 1958, UF integrated with no protest, but by 
the fall of 1970, when Stephen C. O’Connell was 
the president of the university, there were only 343 black students in the entire Student Body at the uni-versity. 
In April 1971, a sit-in at the president’s office 
resulted in the arrest of 66 students. In what was known as the “Black Thursday” protest, O’Connell refused to grant amnesty to the demonstrators in question, and one-third of black students left the 
university. 
Several black faculty members resigned after the 
incident. 
In the 1970s, it was known that students of color 
could not walk on certain places on campus without 
being shunned away, most notably on Turlington Plaza. 
Keeping this history in mind, I would argue th-
ecultural milieu on campus is still segregated be-
cause people find comfort in being a community of 
individuals they are alike in culture.
There is nothing wrong with a person identify-
ing themselves within a community.
But when cultural groups are not willing to in-
teract with one another because of arbitrary cultural differences in order to mobilize for a cause, prob-lems arise.
As the president of the Pi chapter of Sigma Beta 
Rho Fraternity Inc., it is my duty to my organization to raise awareness and respect for all cultures, as many individuals share a birthplace different from 
that of their ancestors. 
In my experience within the Greek community, 
which I view as a microcosm of cultural life on cam-
pus, it can be clearly discerned that the Interfrater -
nity Council and the Panhellenic Council reflect predominately white social organizations, whereas the National Pan-Hellenic Council and the Multi-cultural Greek Council reflect the minority social organizations. The interaction between 
these councils reflect a great deal of segregation in their 
interactions with one another 
whether it’s direct or indirect.
Maybe it’s wrong for me to base my views upon 
the interactions I see within the large Greek com-munity we have here on campus, but I  stand by 
my opinion that our campus community here is more culturally segregated than the environments you might see if you were to walk onto any of the thousands of other college campuses around the 
country. 
I agree with Nate Rushing: You cannot force 
the idea of cultural acceptance or awareness upon 
people. 
That’s not what I am advocating. I’m arguing cultural divisions on campus are 
counterproductive for people to act meaningfully with each other.
I also agree with Rushing that people will never 
see one another as equals.
 But there is no harm in facilitating dialogue 
about current issues of conflict.
Rushing’s points about Gainesville and UF’s pol-
icies are all great, but they are moot. 
Just because freshmen are required to read a 
book on illegal immigration and Gainesville has an openly gay mayor doesn’t automatically make us a campus without serious cultural division and prob-
lems. 
There is no indication of “a bloated sense of po-
litical correctness” within the arguments because 
the arguments I’m making are apolitical and more 
directly to the state of cultural organizations on 
campus.
Rushing “never wants to see a world in which no 
differences are drawn between individuals,”  but he must understand arbitrary assumptions and unfair discrimination toward Tyler Clementi’s sexuality led to his suicide.
 Awareness that discrimination is still present on 
our campus is absolutely critical for us to move on as a campus community.

Readers should have recognized column’s satire 
I saw many people wrote in to point  out the inaccura-
cies of Brian Amos’ Wednesday column. It needs to be stated that he wrote the article to be satirical. However, 
those who did not get it are not fully to blame. 
Amos is  obviously no Jonathan Swift.
In Amos’ defense, though, I’d like to say satire of the 
typical Christian right tea bagger is difficult. Satire should 
be crazier than the opinion it is ridiculing, but it’s hard to 
be any more insane than they already are.

Indifference biggest threat to democracy
Voter apathy is the No. 1 enemy of democracy. Now, the second enemy of democracy is unbridled cor -
porate and special interest money flooding our political 
system. 
This money unfairly influences, manipulates and, 
through corporate-owned media, disseminates disinfor -
mation.
 This corrupts the choice of the people against its own 
collective good and is completely to the benefit of the 
powerful interests. 
Voter apathy is destructive to the rights of individuals. 
An ill-informed, unquestioning and manipulated voter 
serves to increase the privileges of corporations and the 
influence of fringe extremists and, therefore, diminish the rights of individuals.  
An uninterested, unmotivated and nonparticipating 
voter benefits the powerful minority over the good of the individual.
Consider that the next elected officials will impede or 
aid the work of the people’s government, confirm the next Supreme Court nominee, negate or enhance the quality 
of life and the human condition, and defend or limit per -
sonal rights.
By voting we get the government we desire and our 
country needs. By not voting, by default, we get the gov-ernment we deserve.

� A CONFERENCE WILL TAKE PLACE TODAY.
By HAROLD A. ROCHA
Alligator Contributing Writer
The Southeast Regional Conference of Asian American 
Leaders has invited cultural activists such as Cambodian 
spoken-word artist Anida Yoeu Ali and international Na-
than’s hotdog-eating champion Takeru Kobayashi to UF 
to address issues of race, religion, class and sexuality.The conference, which will take place today and Sat-
urday at UF, was created by the Asian American Student Union at UF in an effort to reach out to students about 
issues pertaining to the Asian-American identity.
“I am hoping that the people will 
learn to be better leaders, become aware 
of issues and become active about them because these is-
sues are recurring,” said the conference’s marketing di-
rector Bernie Amaro.
This year, the conference’s workshops include exercis-es in writing personal stories, expanding as an entrepre-
neur and reflecting on the suicide of Rutgers University’s 
Tyler Clementi.
Stars of Asian-American pop culture, such as You-
Tube’s Ryan Higa and Kobayashi, have also shown sup-port by agreeing to come to Gainesville in person to speak 
at the conference.
Other speakers will be Shukla Bose, founder of the 
Parikrma Humanity Foundation; an education activist or -
ganization bringing schools to the underprivileged areas 
of Bangalore; and White House adviser Miya Saika Chen. Asian group reaches out to students about culture

The UF Symphony Orchestra will be perform-
ing its first concert of the year at 7:30 tonight to kick 
off its 100th anniversary at at the Phillips Center for the Performing Arts. 
Lauren Kingry , the assistant conductor for the 
UF Orchestra, said that after three years in the works, with music written specifically for UF by Cirque du Soleil, it’s all come to fruition. 
“It’s exciting that it’s finally happening,” she 
said.
Kingry, a first-year graduate student in orches-
tral conducting, said it’s a great experience for stu-dents to be able to play in the orchestra. She played 
in the UF orchestra during her undergraduate 
years.
“It proves how talented the musicians are,” she 
said.
The orchestra will be playing music from Otto-
rino Respighi, Philip Glass and Cirque du Soleil.
Tickets are still available and cost $12 for stu-
dents and between $30 and $40 for the public.

A visiting ESPNU correspon-
dent wrecked her hotel room after she got a strange prank call early Thursday morning.
Elizabeth Moreau, 27, was 
staying at the Hilton Garden Inn, at 4075 SW 33rd Place, when she got a call telling her the hotel was on fire, according to Gainesville Police Department Capt. Ed Book.
The caller 
told Moreau to line her door with towels, and she quick-
ly did so. The 
caller stressed 
to Moreau the emergency of 
the situation, and then told her to remove the lid off of the room’s toilet and use it to break open her window, which she did, Book said.
After that, the caller made 
some rude remarks, which left Moreau confused and skepti-cal. After hanging up, she real-
ized the hotel wasn’t on fire and 
called police.
Police and the hotel were un-
able to track the number, so it seems the caller got away with his or her prank. During the in-vestigation, Moreau told police she’s been stalked in the past by a man in jail, Book said.Orchestra to kick off season

UF President Bernie Machen 
announced plans for a compre-
hensive review of the university’s 
graduate programs Thursday af-
ternoon at the monthly Faculty Senate meeting.
He said the review would be 
the first of its kind since his tenure as president began in 2004.
“In the seven years I’ve been 
here, we haven’t had the opportu-nity to take a close look at graduate 
education,” he said.
The announcement comes on 
the heels of rankings released by 
the National Research Council, which saw some UF graduate pro-grams rank highly and others re-ceive less recognition.
Machen said he hopes to have a 
committee of distinguished faculty 
assembled within a few weeks to 
conduct the review, which he would like to initiate this semes-ter.
“We will find that there are some very good programs and there are some that are not performing very well at all,” he said.
During UF Provost Joe Glover’s 
report to the Senate, he informed 
those present of recently compiled 
minus-grades statistics.
According to a comparison be-
tween average GPA figures from 2007 to 2008 and figures from more recent semesters, little has changed.
Minus grades went into effect 
in summer of 2009.
“At least on the average grades, 
we do not see any great fluctua-tion,” Glover said.Machen announces

been here, we haven’t 
had the opportunity

UF President� ABOUT 170 ATTENDED.
By CAROLYN TILLO 
Alligator Staff Writer
For Monica Akello, education 
is something to shout about.
The 21-year-old native of 
Uganda, who lost both her par -
ents to the war that started in 
1986, cheered with joy after tell-
ing a crowd of about 170 in Mc-Carty A that she had graduated high school and will be attend-ing college to become a teacher.
“I had to go through difficul-
ties, and education is the key to everything we do on earth,” Ake-llo said. “It is the key to make our 
life a better one.”
Akello is traveling with Invis-
ible Children to spread the word about the conflict in Uganda and 
to raise money for the organiza-tion’s Legacy Scholarship Pro-gram, which sponsors her edu-cation and that of hundreds of other Ugandan students.
Invisible Children is a non-
profit organization that aims to end the conflict in Uganda, which has now spread to the 
Democratic Republic of the Con-
go, South Sudan and the Central African Republic.  
Akello also wants to raise 
money for her high school, Aw-ere Secondary School, which receives donations from UF’s chapter of Invisible Children.
The event included a short 
documentary about Akello and the scholarship program, as well as a longer documentary describ-ing Schools for Schools, an Invis-ible Children program in which  American schools raise funds for schools in Uganda.
Irene Aol, who mentors Ake-
llo and 22 other scholarship stu-
dents, said the violence in North-
ern Uganda has lessened.
“But as much as this war is 
over, the silent war still goes on,” Aol said.
Like Akello, Aol believes ed-
ucation can heal after violence.
“It’s a tool ... which they can 
use to fight injustice in the world 
and a tool with which they can 
be the change which anyone will want to have,” Aol said after the presentation.MulticulturalAffairs ORGANIZATIONS ARE 
LIMITED TO SERVING 130 FREE MEALS PER DAY.
By MINA RADMAN
Alligator Contributing Writer
About 30 protesters gathered 
on the steps of City Hall Thurs-day to publicly oppose a city or -
dinance that limits the amount of meals served by Gainesville’s homeless shelters. 
The rally, organized by the 
International Socialist Organiza-tion, is the latest in an ongoing debate on the ordinance, which limits shelters to serving 130 free meals a day.
The meal limit was started to 
disperse services so the homeless wouldn’t crowd downtown, said Katie Walters, co-organizer of the rally. 
But she doesn’t believe the 
homeless population presents a problem. 
“I work down the street from 
the St. Francis House, and I’ve never been harassed by a home-less person,” she said. “The only problem I see is people are not being fed.”
Joe Cnyder hosted the rally 
and presented six speakers who 
discussed the issue, including Walters and Pat Fitzpatrick, an 
advocate for the homeless who ran for a city commission seat to 
repeal the meal limits.
The group later entered the 
commission meeting to present 
a one-minute, 55-second clip of a pregnant woman who was num-
ber 131 in line.
“This is one of the worst 
things I’ve seen in 40 years as a 
social worker,” Fitzpatrick said. “They’re doing this to criminal-
ize the homeless.”
The limit has been in place 
since 1993 but has only been seri-
ously enforced since early 2009, when the city commission threat-
ened to close down the St. Francis 
House if it did not comply with 
the code. In 2009, Gainesville 
was labeled the fifth-meanest city in the country in regards to 
treatment of the homeless.
 “[The commission] is focus-
ing on the wrong problem,” Wal-
ters said. “You can’t just make people disappear.”FRIDAY, OCTOBER 22, 2010  ALLIGATOR, 9

The hospital is equipped with cameras so students can see procedures
Hoffsis said the design of the building puts equal concentra-
tion on teaching, patient care and client welfare.
“It’s a beautiful building,” he said.  “I’ve never seen a build-
ing designed so well for this purpose.”
The hospital also features a stereotactic linear accelerator 
that is used to treat cancer cells.  This machine, which is rarely featured in veterinary hospitals, is also used at the McKnight 
Brain Institute at UF.  Hoffsis said that its addi-
tion was partially due to an increasing demand for cancer treatment of clients’ pets.
One veterinary education innovation in the 
hospital is surgical suite cameras that can transmit live video of procedures to classrooms, giving students a view that was previously exclusive to surgeons.  Jonathan Mathers, a fourth-year veterinary student, has al-
ready toured the hospital and said that it is more modern and spacious than the current hospital.
“It gives you the feeling that you’re part of something 
great,” Mathers said.  
Another difference Mathers mentioned is the addition of 
“rounds rooms,” which he described as places where students can work without getting in the way of hospital business. VET , from page 1

FRIDAY, OCTOBER 22, 2010 �  ALLIGATOR, 17
I usually stay on the pessimistic side with ECU, but I like 
this matchup.
The Herd is 1-5 and led by former Florida assistant Doc 
Holliday, who last worked with the Gators as safeties coach 
in 2007. Remember that secondary? And remember Kyle 
Jackson?
ECU has the nation’s No. 8 passing offense, and Marshall 
is 96th in pass defense. 
Get off me. The Herd is getting painted purple Saturday.
— MIKE McCALL
Marshall will invoke the ghost of Byron Leftwich and 
pull the upset because:
Mike can’t see straight through that Jimi Hendrix-purple 
haze. Few people are more irrational than life-or-death fans, 
and McCall falls in that category. 
When asked to preview the 2007 Florida-Tennessee game 
on ESPN, Mike said the Gators held the edge simply because of their kicker, an ECU transfer. Go ahead, look it up on You-Tube under the “kid with elongated/misshapen head and neck” title.
Point is, you can’t take advice about the Purple Pirates 
from Mike. When ECU was a 20-point underdog against Virginia Tech a month ago, he called all his friends advis-ing them to bet on “free money” like that guy who wears the question-mark suit on infomercials.
It’s a given that the Pirates are going to put up points (36.8 
per game), but Ruffin McNeill’s defense (surrendering 39.5 points per game) will weep like Don Draper’s old secretary (and Mike’s celebrity crush) Allison did when she got man-handled.  
— TYLER JETTNow on to the picks! 
In first with a record of 36-32 is alligatorSports assistant 
editor Tyler “This is my mom’s phone” Jett, who had to bor -
row Malissa’s cell because his own died after calling 1-900 
numbers all night. Now the whole sports staff finally has a re-liable method for reaching Tyler. And, even better, his mom.
Sitting in second with a 35-33 record is Gatorbait.net’s 
Keith “In my day, we didn’t play any of these Mexican sports” Niebuhr, whose journalistic prowess was tossed out the window when he was asked to cover soccer last weekend. He wondered how UF coach Becky Burleigh could communi-
cate with all them foreigners, only to be told that, yes, white 
people play soccer now.
Leading a three-way tie for third place with a record of 
33-35 is alligatorSports writer Kyle “I’m at least the 15th-most famous kid from my high school” Maistri, who, in case you didn’t know, was a pretty big deal back in Wellington. And if you somehow didn’t know that, you will read all about Kyle’s adolescent popularity when he launches his own Wikipedia 
page.
Tied with Kyle is alligatorSports editor Anthony “Lil’ Ha-
vana” Chiang, who has been waking up from dreams of a 
fritas and boliches in cold sweats every night this week. An-
thony can’t function for more than a month without tradi-
tional Cuban dishes, meaning Florida’s bye week could not have come at a better time.
Rounding out the menage a trois in third is The Gainesville 
Sun’s Edward “Rebel Black Bear” Aschoff, who became yet another casualty of down-home Southern hospitality when 
his mighty Ole Miss Rebels were renamed after an animal 
FROM LOUISIANA. The classic rebel was great, but the con-federacy seems to be frowned on for some reason. Any idea why, Edward? 
In sixth place with a 32-36 record is alligatorSports writer Mike “It’s not gay, it’s family” McCall, who will return to the scene of many high-school hookups tonight when he shares the trunk of his Jeep with a special someone: his brother. Sleeping without a blanket will be tough. But, lucky for Mike, 
Corey makes for a perfect little spoon.
Still in seventh place with a record of 31-37 is FightinGa-
tor.com’s Cody “Those 6-year-olds would have been eating 
my dust” Jones, who was selected to participate in a kiddie 
race at a UF sporting event. Cody would have been rolling 
deep with a $10 Papa Johns gift card, but he forgot his span-dex shorts and didn’t have the 25 minutes he demands for proper stretching.
And in dead-ass last place with a piss-poor record of 30-
38 is the Miami Herald’s Joe “There’s no better time to at-tack than when they can’t see you” Goodman, who, just one week after leaving Gainesville, ripped the Gators for hopping 
off the Cam Newton Express. This ninja-style reporting was 
undoubtedly inspired by Joe’s hero, Adam Silverstein of On-lyGators.com PICKS , from page 18

UF coach Billy Donovan believes Georgia should receive more praise than the Gators. Bull -
dogs juniors Trey Thompkins and Travis Leslie made the preseason All-SEC squad.
Tennessee’s Pearl: Florida is 
team to beat in SEC East
three straight to Syracuse, Richmond 
and South Alabama. 
“I don’t think a lot of the times we’ve 
handled the expectations well, of when we’ve been ranked at different times during the course of our careers,” Dono-van said. 
In Donovan’s eyes, the team that 
“clearly may be better than everyone else” in the SEC is Georgia, who split its two meetings with Florida last season. 
The Bulldogs return a pair of pre-
season All-SEC First-Team selections in juniors Trey Thompkins and Travis Leslie, who each ranked in the top 15 in conference scoring and rebounding last 
season.
“Georgia was a team last year that 
was on the cusp of really having an un-
believable season,” Donovan said. “If 
you look at the amount of games they 
had that came down to the wire and they were right there and could’ve won, it’s really really remarkable.”
Although the Bulldogs finished last 
season 14-17 and were picked to finish third in the SEC East this year, Donovan 
noted that seven of their losses were by 
four points or fewer. 
Tennessee coach Bruce Pearl, on the 
other hand, is buying in to the Florida 
hype. 
Pearl claims that there is a “gap” be-
tween Florida and every other team in 
the SEC East. 
Regardless, the Florida players have 
realized that no matter what the coaches and the media predict, only they control whose perception becomes reality. 
“We’re going to continue work-
ing hard regardless of how high we’re ranked,” Parsons said. “I think all of the expectations are based on what we did 
last year and who we have returning. 
We still have a lot to improve on and a lot of things to get better at.”HOOPS , from page 18Torosian scores goal just 30 seconds after entering the game
easy to defend with the way we 
attack, but I thought we were re-ally good at staying focused at 
the task at hand.”
LSU was not without its chanc-
es in the second half, and in the first 90 seconds the Tigers nearly scored the equalizer. But Gators 
goalie Katie Fraine spoiled the attempt and preserved the shut-
out. 
LSU matched Florida in shots 
on goal with five, but the Tigers 
couldn’t break the sometimes-leaky Gators defense. 
Fraine made several key saves and twice benefited from balls 
that drilled the post and evaded the goal. 
In the 71st min-
ute, Burleigh sub-stituted one goal 
scorer for another. 
The Gators coach swapped Travis for sophomore midfielder 
Natalia Torosian, who promptly 
scored 30 seconds after entering the game. 
On a play set up by fellow 
substitute Maggie Rodgers, Toro-sian ripped a shot from 10 yards inside the box, her third goal of the 2010 campaign. Burleigh said they both played 
well in practice this week and de-served a shot to play. 
Travis echoed her coach’s sen-
timents.
 “They came out and did a 
great job bringing energy to the team,” she said. “They both de-
served that.”

On Wednesday afternoon, 
just before departing for Loui-
siana, Taylor Travis got a hair -
cut that reminded many around 
the program of former UF great Abby Wambach. 
Sporting her fresh ‘do last night against LSU, Travis scored 
a goal that even Wambach 
would have been jealous of. 
The freshman forward led 
No. 12 Florida (13-2-2, 7-1-1 
Southeastern Conference) to a 
2-0 victory over LSU (6-7-4, 3-3-3 SEC) with a blast from nearly 40 yards out that drilled the up-per 90 in the left corner of the post.  
Travis received the ball at 
midfield and saw space as the LSU defenders were drawn by UF attackers and parted like the 
Red Sea. 
“I had a shot and I knew it 
was far away,” she said. “But 
why the heck not, so I took it and it happened to be a good hit.”
The goal came in the fourth 
minute of action, and it set a 
positive tone for the rest of the 
match. 
Determined to avoid a let-
down similar to their last road 
trip, the Gators hunkered down 
and didn’t allow LSU to get on the board. 
It was Florida’s third SEC 
road victory this season, all 
with a final line of 2-0. 
“It’s tough at this point of the 
season to go on the road in the 
SEC and get a shutout,” coach 
Becky Burleigh said. “We’re 
happy with that for sure.” 
After Travis’ early goal, the 
rest of the first half was a de-fensive grudge match as Flor -
ida failed to mount any real threats.
The Tigers consistently 
clogged the middle and closed 
the passing lanes, forcing the 
Gators to alter their usual at-tack. 
But Florida did a good job in 
the first half of thwarting LSU’s 
long-ball threats. 
“I thought defensively we 
were really on our toes,” Bur -
leigh said. “LSU put a lot of pressure on us. They liked to 
pump the long ball through the box and sometimes that’s not SITE: Your Living Room

alligatorSports.org SCOREBOARD TEEING OFF WITH ANTHONY CHIANGThere are certain matchups that 
stand the test of time — hard-fought 
battles that seep into the fabric of 
American culture and come to define 
the emotions of sport for generations of spectators.
In a few instances, a rivalry gains 
enough mass appeal that even Holly-wood takes notice and puts it on the silver screen. 
Today, we at the alligatorSports 
Brand Picks Column debate one of 
those rivalries: East Carolina-Mar -
shall, which was immortalized in the 
film “We Are Marshall.”
OK, so the movie was actually 
made because of the tragic events fol-lowing the game, when the Thunder -
ing Herd’s plane crashed on its return to West Virginia. But we had to get your attention somehow for this Con-
ference USA slugfest.
We know at least two people who 
do actually care about this game, as 
our own Mike McCall and his brother, 
Corey, are making the drive to Green-
ville, N.C., to see their beloved Pirates play.
We let Mike and fellow columnist 
Tyler Jett battle it out to decide which 
team has the leg up.
The Pirates will plunder the 
(-13-point) booty because:
They can’t do this to me. I live and 
die with ECU’s every win and loss, 
and I’ve grown used to plenty of the latter in 22 years of support. 
But I’m driving eight hours for this 
game, and the Pirates wouldn’t dare 
let me down.
This is a crucial game for ECU’s 
quest for a third straight conference 
title, and winning it would get me one 
step closer to my dream of seeing the 
Pirates beat the Gators in the Liberty Bowl at the end of this season.

Florida is a team that hasn’t won an 
NCAA Tournament game in three years, 
but you wouldn’t know it based on their 
preseason expectations. 
The Gators, who are No. 11 in the ESPN/
USA Today Preseason Coaches’ Poll, have already been tabbed as the favorite to win 
the Southeastern Conference despite fin-
ishing in the bottom half of their division a season ago.
With five starters returning to a team 
that added one of the nation’s top recruit-
ing classes, many are predicting a deep run 
by Florida in this year’s tournament.
But coach Billy Donovan is quick to point out that perception does not always equal reality. 
“We’re kinda a feel good team right now 
with five starters returning from the NCAA Tournament,” Donovan said Thursday at 
the SEC media day in Hoover, Ala. “But 
the reality is we got knocked out in the 
first round and we finished fourth in the (SEC) East last year.”
Donovan notes that 
even with buzzer-beating wins against South Caro-
lina and North Carolina 
State, Florida was still “on 
pins and needles” during 
Selection Sunday in March.
Had senior Chandler Parsons missed ei-
ther of those now-famous last-second shots, Donovan contends that the Gators would not have made the tournament, and that this season’s expectations would be entirely 
different. 
“If we were a team that didn’t get in to 
the tournament, the questions today would 
be, ‘Coach, three straight years without a tournament, are you guys feeling the pres-sure?’” Donovan said. 
“Now since we got into the NCAA Tour -
nament, it’s, ‘Coach, five starters back, you’re picked to win the East.’ So what is the truth?”
Perhaps the truth is that the Gators are 
better off without the lofty expectations. 
Last season Florida started the year un-
ranked, climbed all the way up to No. 11 af-
ter an 8-0 start, and then proceeded to lose Donovan wary of Gators’ preseason hype

Butler praised Stewart for her leadership in practice and 
for helping the young players develop. But Stewart said 
the newcomers have so much energy that she finds herself 
working harder to keep up.
Butler plans to take advantage of that energy by making 
a transition in the offensive game plan. 
Last year, UF mostly ran a half-court offense, relying on 
set plays to score points and move the ball.
She said the Gators now have the personnel to play a 
full-court game, in which there is little structure and the em-
phasis is placed on letting players make 
instinctive decisions.
“It’s not about the coach calling the 
plays as much as it is them stepping up 
and bringing what they bring to the table,” 
she said.
Whether these Gators have enough will 
be determined in January, when conference play begins.
UF hosts Tennessee and Kentucky, the SEC’s preseason 
No. 1 and No. 2 teams, respectively, over the course of seven days early in league play.
And Butler wouldn’t have it any other way.
“I think if you’re a competitor, and in particular if you’re 
a great athlete, that you really want to find out how good 
you are,” Butler said. “There’s not any question that this is 
the league you come to and play in.
“It’s fun to compete on that level every night, but it’s not 
for the faint of heart.”Gators want to play at

After playing three games in six days, the Gators 
will finally have some extra time to prepare for their 
next match.
No. 1 Florida (17-1, 10-0 Southeastern Conference) 
will take on Kentucky (11-9, 5-5 SEC) on Sunday in the 
O’Connell Center  at 1:30 p.m.
This will be the second meeting between the two 
teams this season. The Gators defeated the Wildcats in 
Lexington, Ky., 3-1 (18-25, 25-19, 25-13, 25-20) on Sept. 
17.
“Where it wasn’t perfect or ideal for Tennessee, at 
least it was our second time playing them,” coach Mary 
Wise said. “I think it would’ve been much harder if it was the first time that we played Tennessee coming off 
just two days of preparation. We get two days before 
Kentucky, where normally it would just be one day.”
With only ten matches remaining in the regular 
season, Wise did not expect her team to be in such a favorable position.
“Did I think we would be at this point in terms 
of our record? No,” Wise said. “None of us saw that 
coming based on who we were playing in September, 
based on that schedule — as we went from at Florida State, at Tennessee, at Kentucky — none of us would 
have predicted (so much success).”
UF held Kentucky to a hitting percentage of .116 in the first match. However, the Gators hit only .229 and 
had just two players hit over .250 — junior setter Kelly Murphy and sophomore right side hitter Tangerine Wiggs.
Serves and blocks were not a problem for the Gators 
in the last meeting. They finished with 14 blocks and seven service aces. However, Wise says the team is a work in progress and there is still room to improve.
“Things aren’t happening quite as regular, and it’s 
not ingrained in terms of some of the things we’re ask-ing them to do,” Wise said. “We’re improving in all 
aspects of our game.”
Against Tennessee on Wednes-
day, the Gators were out-blocked by the Volunteers in UF’s 3-0 (25-20, 25-23, 25-20) victory, leaving the team with room to improve before Sunday.
“A big thing that we’re going to 
work on is our defense,” junior out-side hitter Kristy Jaeckel said. “We 
left a couple blocks out there and definitely some digs 
out there so I think those are some big things we’re go-
ing to key on the next couple days.”
Jaeckel is coming off a performance of 12 kills and a 
.346 hitting percentage.
“Kentucky is a great offensive team, they always 
play awesome against us and it’s always a fun match,” Jaeckel said. Florida rests after tough week

Quite frankly, the UF fan base 
is overrated. 
This remains hidden behind 
the aura of The Swamp and the success the program has experi-
enced in the past decade. But take away all of the championships and Gators fans wouldn’t have a good reputation.
Even UCF fans can do what you

you sing “In all kinds of weather, we’ll all stick together”?

The weather has taken a turn for the worst 
and the dark clouds have opened up. But instead of using an umbrella to combat it, most of you just want 
to stay inside and complain. After a couple years of 
sunny weather, you are spoiled. 
This is the sad state of the Gator Nation, which in-
stead is looking like a nation of fair-weather fans this 
season.
Beat down at Alabama — saw it coming.
A close loss to LSU — offensive coordinator Steve

Things have gotten ugly in Gainesville and the 
country is calling fans out. On Wednesday’s edition

Now I know there is only a 
small percentage that want the 
UF coach fired. But there are 
quite a few of you who have given up on this team already. That’s not what being a fan is 
about.
Three losses in a row is bad and I’m not here to 
defend the Gators’ boring style of play. But I do know 
that Florida fans don’t show up to men’s basketball games when the team is bad, and they usually don’t 
attend  baseball or women’s basketball games unless 
it’s the postseason. 
Now  the football team has lost three straight reg-
ular-season games for the first time since 1999 and 
fans are mocking the offensive players and calling for 
coaches to be fired.

Coach Amanda Butler’s team 
lacks experience, something she 
hopes to compensate for with a men-
tal edge.
Confidence and toughness have 
become themes of offseason chatter, and Butler hopes those aspects will 
be ingrained in her players every 
time they step on the court.
The coach emphasized those keys 
again Wednesday when she and cen-
ter Azania Stewart represented the 
Gators in Hoover, Ala., at the South-eastern Conference media day.
“To me, [toughness] is a great 
equalizer,” Butler said. “Regardless 
of whether you’re playing some -
one who may be more experienced, 
who’s a little bit taller, who’s more athletic, maybe they’ve got a better 
coach. Whatever the case may be, I 
think that toughness can level the playing field.”
And Butler will need some sort 
of equalizer this season. With six 
newcomers, one senior and only two 
starters returning from last year’s 15-17 team, doubts surround the program and its ability to succeed in 
the competitive SEC. 
In fact, preseason media polls 
predict the Gators to finish in a tie 
for last place with Mississippi State.
That has Stewart fired up. 
“It makes you angry, but it just 
adds fuel to the fire and makes you 
work harder,” Stewart said. “We re-ally want to show them what we 
have.”
She knows the nature of the SEC 
and thinks her time spent playing for 
Great Britain’s Olympic team over the summer will bring more physi-cality to her game. Stewart said she 
has been readying her teammates for 
conference play. 
“You can’t sleep on any team in the SEC,” Stewart said. “There’s some good teams out there. They have to be ready for us, just as much
