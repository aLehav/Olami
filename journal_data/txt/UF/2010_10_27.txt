After running five marathons, 
including the New York Marathon 
at the age of 62, John Brown’s knees gave out. Now, at 80, he dances.
Brown was a participant in 
Dance for Seasoned Citizens, a free class by Shands Arts in Medicine program.
Brown, a 1957 UF alumnus, said 
he read about the class in the Senior Times when the classes began in January, and he has attended since.
The class is taught by Rusti 
Brandman, who previously taught 
dance at UF and helped establish the 
dance major. Brandman described herself as being “old enough to teach this class,” but she wouldn’t describe herself as a senior. 
 “I don’t like being called a senior 
— I’ve graduated, thank you,” said Brandman, who graduated with a Ph.D. in dance from Florida State 
University in 1977. 
She said the Shands Arts in Med-
icine program allows for patients in 
the hospital, families, friends and those in the Gainesville community to be creative through art classes, yoga or dance.
Misa Hoang, a third-year health 
education and behavior major, said working with Shands Arts in Medi-cine has given her a better view of the hospital job life. She’s seen that it’s not all doctors and nurses rush-
ing to save lives.
Hoang, who has been assistant to 
Lauren Arce, a Shands Arts in Medi-cine coordinator, since the spring 
semester, said the dance class, along with many others offered, is a great way to have fun, meet people and 
dance for everyone.
“It’s a creative way to express 
themselves,” she said.Brandman said she remembers 
a woman coming up to her after a 
class and telling her that “she ap-preciated the chance to laugh.” That 
thank you has stuck with her.
At the end of the day, Brandman 
said, the class is about making peo-ple feel relevant and giving them a 
sense of accomplishment while they may be in a difficult period. 
Dance for Seasoned Citizens is 
taught every Tuesday afternoon at the Shands Cancer Hospital and is open to the public.
Bolivian cops detain woman who tried to mail mummy
LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) — Bolivian police said they’ve de-
tained a woman who tried to mail a mummy to France. Police 
Col. Adolfo Cardenas said Tuesday a Peruvian woman tried to send the human remains from a post office in the town of Desa-guadero along the Peruvian border. The destination was in the French city of Compiegne.
The mummy was discovered in a routine check of the pack-
age.
Cardenas said he doesn’t know how old the mummy is, but 
says it was well-preserved and may have been from the Inca cul-ture.

A Gainesville man is dead and a 
woman is in stable condition after he 
shot her and himself in what police think might have been a lovers’ quarrel 
early Tuesday morning.
Police arrived at about 3:42 a.m. to 
check out a call from someone who said 
they heard gunshots coming from a car around the 200 block of Northwest Third 
Street, said Lt. Tim Hayes.
Officers saw Michael Peterson, 33, 
driving the car described by the call-
er, then heard another gunshot and watched as the car lost control and ran into a nearby light pole, Hayes said.Police found Peterson alive with a 
gunshot wound to the head and Sabrina Young, 31, alive with two shots in her neck. The couple were taken to Shands 
at UF for immediate care, Hayes said.
Within hours, Peterson was dead, but 
Young is in stable condi-
tion in the intensive care unit, Hayes said.
Police said that Young 
and Peterson have been romantically involved before and are currently inves-tigating into the nature of their relation-ship recently.

Santa Fe College students signed banners 
covering a Regional Transit System bus Tues-
day morning at the kickoff of SFC’s Start the 
Bus! campaign.
The event was held to support unlimited 
access to the bus system for SFC students. 
Specifically, the students were supporting 
legislation that would allow all Florida col-
leges to add a small transportation fee to each credit hour for students. 
“This is what the students want,” said SFC 
Student Government President Austin Brinza. “The students here also need the options that the universities have, and we want to pass this transportation bill.”
The event included food, a DJ, activities, 
a press conference and an information booth providing the students with information on the proposed legislation. 
Most everyone who walked by the Oak 
Grove on the SFC campus signed the peti-tion.
Among the speakers in attendance were 
Mayor Craig Lowe and the president of SFC, Dr. Jack-
son Sasser.
“The purpose of the 
whole event is to spread awareness and encourage others to take action and urge legislatures to pass the 
bill this year,” Brinza said. 
“The biggest thing that 
helps out is the fact that we’ve got other state 
colleges that are in the same boat. It’s a state-wide initiative.”

Students need to spend at least 150 hours 
studying for a single test in order to get into 
graduate school, according to standardized-
test preparation professionals. 
The Student Government cabinets of Aca-
demic Affairs and Graduate/Professional Affairs hosted a workshop Tuesday night in Little Hall to help give students the skills and knowledge to prepare for graduate school. 
Ashley Johnson, director of the Graduate/Professional Affairs cabinet, said the purpose 
of the event was to provide students with ad-
vice on how to prepare for graduate school. 
A crowd of about 30 people came to the 
event.
Mike Heckmann, a Kaplan LSAT prep 
instructor, spoke about the graduate admis-sions process and the four steps to get into graduate school. Heckmann said students should know the factors when applying.
“You need more than a high GPA because 
you are competing against others with and without graduate degrees,” Heckmann said. He said students must have the GPA and 
test scores as well as the experience to make 
them unique for that graduate program.
They should also be clear about their mo-
tivations, he said, and ask themselves why they want to go to graduate school and why they want to go to their chosen school. 
“You should be spending three to six 
months researching graduate programs be-
fore you apply,” Heckmann said. “Treat your application as a long-term process.”
He also said students should make their 
experiences work for them and be able to ex-plain why they are important. 
“Connect your experiences to an over -
hauling picture of you,” he said. “It’s a story about you and not just your random experi-ences.”

Four candidates running for 
seats on the School Board of Alach-
ua County spoke in a panel at Hog-getowne Middle School, a charter school, on Tuesday evening. 
About 80 people attended the 
event, which focused on charter schools. 
A charter school is a public school 
that is funded by a nonprofit corpo-ration, according to Gaspar Nichols, the principal of Hoggetowne Middle School.
April Griffin and Rick Nesbit are 
running in the Tuesday elections for the District 1 seat, and Carol Oye-narte and Jancie Vinson are running for the District 5 seat.
During the panel, the candidates 
expressed their support for charter schools and the roles the schools play in the public school system.
Nesbit said that he sees charter 
schools as a way to experiment with curriculum in a way that can’t be achieved in public schools.
There are more than a dozen 
charter schools in the county, ac-cording to Nesbit.The candidates also discussed 
funding for the schools. 
“It’s always about money ,” said 
Neal Drake, who founded The One Room School House, which was the 
first charter school in the county . 
The myth is that charter 
schools take away funding from 
public schools, he said. “I’d like to see that myth go away.”  
According to Drake, charter schools actually bring in money from the na-tional and state level — money that public schools use 
Other questions brought up dur -
ing the panel included whether candidates believed that charter schools pose an eco-
nomic risk to public schools and if they would promote small local charters. 
“I thought the candidates did a 
pretty good job,” Drake said. “It’s difficult to get very specific on a lot of issues so detailed.”
Drake said that he was glad that 
the whole event centered on char -
ter schools and he believes that no candidate is feared by any charter school parent.
“The board seems open to learn 
about charter schools,” he said.School board candidates discuss charters, funding

In a heated debate Tuesday night, Stu-
dent Senators passed a bill that allows only 
for bills passed by the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee to be heard in Senate meetings. 
The bill passed by a majority vote.Student Alliance party Senator Kevin Kle-
ponis urged senators to vote against the bill and said it would limit the rights of the mi-nority party, as according to it, any bill sent to Senate unfavorably must pass by a two-thirds vote.  
“We might step into a situation where 
everyone’s voice is in the hands of three peo-ple,” he added during public debate. 
Senator Severin Walstad, who represents 
the Unite Party , said he does not think this bill violates the rights of the minority parties in Senate but would lead authors to write 
better bills. 
“We trust the Judiciary Committee to 
decide whether a bill has merit and constitu-
tionality,” Walstad explained.
Additionally , Senators unanimously 
awarded $300 to Gators Humans v . Zombies and $1,365 to Coalition of Hispanics Integrat-
ing Spanish Speakers through Advocacy and

Students made a trip to Hogwarts School of Witch-

About 600 Harry Potter fans, from Slytherins to 
Gryffindors, attended the RUB Halloween at Hogwarts 
event in the Rion Ballroom. 
The event featured activities ranging from candle-
making and tea-leaf reading to Dark Mark henna tat-
toos and a Harry Potter-themed costume contest. 
Jenna Dufficy , promotions director for RUB, said the 
event, which was created in honor of Harry Potter and 
the Deathly Hollows movie premiere on Nov . 19, was 
put together in only three weeks. 
In total, the budget for the night was $2,000. 
“Hands down this is the most successful special

Floating across the stage during the costume con-
test was Cynthia Chang, dressed as Moaning Myrtle, complete with toilet seat. Chang, who placed won the costume contes, has attended at least five Harry Potter book and movie premieres.

A cholera outbreak in Haiti has 
prompted UF to restrict undergraduate 
travel to the recovering country.
According to a memorandum sent out 
Sunday by Provost Joe Glover, the deci-
sion stems from consultation with medi-
cal personnel about the public health con-
ditions in Haiti.
According to the World Health Orga-
nization website, cholera is an intestinal 
infection that can be caused by drinking contaminated water. It leads to severe di-
arrhea, and, as a result, severe dehydra-
tion and even death.
As of Tuesday evening, the media re-ported almost 300 deaths from the week-
old outbreak.
UF travel for faculty and graduate stu-
dents is still allowed under certain condi-
tions.
He or she must be fully informed 
about the risks, receive permission from 
the dean of the International Center and 
the dean of his or 
her college and carry 
with them a personal 
re-hydration kit in 
case they come in contact with a cholera outbreak or if they contract the illness.
“Finding medical assistance in Haiti 
in case of illness could be problematic,” Glover wrote. 
The current travel restriction to Haiti is the second imposed by the university since 
the Caribbean nation was devastated by a 
7.0-magnitude earthquake on Jan. 12.
A ban prohibiting university-related 
travel for all students went into effect in 
early February . 
The ban was modified in July , with 
eased restrictions for faculty and staff and 
waivers for students to travel under cer -
tain conditions.
UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes said a 
class of eight environmental engineering 
students with plans to work on a solid 
waste management project in Haiti has had its waivers rescinded.
Their trip is now postponed.“Their goal is to try and make the trip 
once the situation improves,” she said.UF snatches back Haiti clearance

Student Alliance Party SenatorSomething stinks in Orange County. It’s 
an attack ad mailed by Republican Congres-
sional candidate Van Tran that paints a pic-ture of incumbent Democratic lawmaker Lo-retta Sanchez as an insider politician. Tran’s campaign manager George Andrews told the Orange County Register the mailer looks like a perfume ad and features a scratch-and-sniff patch that is supposed to smell like trash.
The ad says: “It’s the stench of Washing-
ton.”
Sanchez’s campaign manager Caroline 
Hogan said the mailer is a gimmick in poor taste and the congresswoman has been cam-paigning on issues of importance to local families.
Sanchez is facing the 
first serious challenge to her seat since she was elect-ed in 1996.
Meanwhile, California 
gubernatorial candidates Meg Whitman and Jerry Brown were placed on the 
hot seat during a joint ap-
pearance at a women’s conference, when 
they were asked to pull their negative adver -
tising.
Brown, a Democrat, said he would do so 
if Whitman agreed. But Whitman, a Repub-
lican, said she would pull only the TV spots 
that are character attacks.
She said she needs to tell Californians 
about Brown’s record as governor from 1975 to 1983 — and she then proceeded to attack it.
Her answer prompted loud boos Tuesday 
from the audience at California first lady Ma-ria Shriver’s annual women’s conference.
“Today” show host Matt Lauer had asked 
the candidates to pull the attack ads that have flooded the airwaves in California. Both can-didates are in the final week of an increas-ingly negative race for governor.

NewsInternational HAUNTED THOMAS IS
 LOCATED IN SLEDD HALL.
By ERIN RAUCH
Alligator Contributing Writer
The faint sound of chainsaws 
and shrill screams echoed from the 
basement of Sledd Hall on Tues-day night.
Gillian Finklea, a committee 
member for Haunted Thomas, the haunted house attraction at the dorm, said this year’s house had seven rooms featuring various horror movies and about 20 resi-dent assistants dressed in Hallow-een costumes.
The haunted house was free 
and open to the public. Finklea 
said she hoped more than 150 peo-
ple would leave with their hearts pounding this year.
Ronnie Pirtle, 23, a criminol-
ogy senior, and first-time visitor to a campus haunted house, said it seemed like the organizers put a lot of work into Haunted Thomas.
“I’m still sweating,” he said. 
“Just being down there is creepy.”
UF residence halls will be 
swinging open the doors to their haunted houses this week, featur -
ing mazes, tour guides and hun-dreds of Halloween decorations. 
Hume Hall’s doors will open at 
5:30 p.m. Thursday for members of the Boys and Girls Club of Alachua 
County. General admission begins 
at 8 p.m.
“It’s a fun activity that involves 
the community at large,” said Am-ber Suleskey, 20, residential chan-cellor of the Student Honors Orga-nization at Hume Hall.
There will be eight haunted 
houses, one on each of the four 
floors in the two Hume buildings.
A $3 donation is requested 
to enter all eight of the haunted 
houses. Money raised will benefit the Boys and Girls Club of Alachua County.
Spooky Springs will open 
Wednesday at 8 p.m. in the activity room of the Springs Complex.
Tabitha Gorman, 21, president 
of the Springs Area Residential Council, has helped turn Springs into a spooky thriller for three years. She said more than 100 stu-dents attended last year and hopes 
at least 150 will attend this year.
There is no entrance fee for UF 
students. Popcorn, sodas and can-
dy will be provided. 
Sierra Meador, 21, organized 
this year’s monster bash at Bro-ward Hall.
She said she expects more than 1,000 people between 8 p.m. and 
midnight Thursday. The house is 
free and open to the public.
Sixty volunteers from all over 
campus helped create the haunted house, including members of Hu-mans v. Zombies.
Meador said the Inter-Residence 
Hall Association provides most of the funds for the event. 
“When I became an RA in this 
area and heard they did a haunt-ed house, I knew I had to get in-volved,” she said.

Students get scary with on-campus haunted house

While the iPad is entertaining people with its techno-
logical charm, students and teachers at UF are finding it 
unsuccessful in the classroom. 
The iBookstore app, Apple’s downloadable book-
store, provides students and teachers with books rang-
ing across all genres, including textbooks. However, 
students are still opting for real, user-friendly textbooks rather than the downloadable variant.
UF  student LeAsia Lundy is one of the students who 
would rather purchase textbooks from the bookstore versus the iBookstore.
“I probably wouldn’t [use the iPad] for textbooks,” 
Lundy said. “They aren’t efficient for me because I have to highlight, underline and write notes in a book.”
UF marketing student Chelsea Schonhoff owns sever -
al Apple products but doesn’t see herself using the iPad for reading textbooks either. Schonhoff sees herself using the iPad more as a computer.
“I like to have the book in person; I prefer that,” 
Schonhoff said. “If I got [the iPad] I wouldn’t use it to read on.”
While some are pessimistic about the iPad’s chances 
in the classroom, others, such as UF College of Education 
professor Dorene Ross, believe the iPad may have a place 
in academia.
While it is difficult to measure the iPad’ s current use-
fulness in the classroom because so few students own them, Ross believes it has the potential to be incorporat-ed into the classroom.Ross also said the iPad holds more value in the class-
room for its interactive nature, such as apps, versus  be-ing used for text-based readings. 
Potential success, Ross said, could depend on the in-
structor and how he or she engages the class with it.
But Ross also pointed out how using the iPad in the 
classroom may come with a few drawbacks. The iPad, she said, could prove to be as distracting as a computer for students. 
“The issue is what students are being asked to do 
with them,” Ross said. “If the basic mode of instruction is completely teacher-dominated, text-based, passive on the part of students, then iPads will be used as a distrac-
tion because school isn’t very engaging.”
Students may also have  difficulty taking notes on the 
touch keypad, something Ross acknowledged she has 
had problems with. 
Despite its shortcomings, she believes students and 
teachers could really find the iPad beneficial in the class-room.
“The potential of the iPad is collaboratively investi-
gating things with students within the context of a class-
room, getting them really engaged, seeking information 
and making them more independent within the structure of a classroom,” she  said.iPad draws mixed reactions at UF
“I probably wouldn’t [use the iPad]             
for textbooks.”

Today’s question: Are you too old to dress up for Halloween?
87 TOTAL VOTES11% YES89% NOTuesday’s question: Have you ever visited a student safety zone at the UF-Georgia game?In battle vs. productivity, Apple wins
My entertainment never takes priority over my 
reading. 
I repeat that phrase like a mantra as we 
head into the midterm season, and I try to stay away from midterm malaise – that general laziness we feel upon burning out and the irrepressible desire to sleep, play video games, eat unhealthy foods and watch SNL: 
The Best of Will Ferrell on Netflix.
But that doesn’t mean we can’t have fun every now 
and then, right? 
I attended girls’ soccer and volleyball games in the 
past week in addition to the Homecoming Game we all want to forget, and I’ve not limited my interaction with 
my friends or family.
That is until Oct. 20 when my productivity train was 
finally derailed. The ladies and gentlemen behind Apple 
wowed me again with their “Back to the Mac” event.
I’d love to say I have bundles and bundles of cash to 
spend on new Apple products, but I’d be lying. I am an 
Apple fanboy in every sense of the word, and a boy can dream, right?
The first announcement was iLife 11, an update to 
Apple’s consumer-based media creation software that allows any regular Joe to organize photos, make movies and pretend to be musical virtuosos while manipulating 
Apple’s computerized pianos and guitars.
Next, iPhoto increases geo-tagging capabilities, and 
throws in better integration with Flickr and Facebook. 
That’s a step in the right direction, as cloud comput-ing and social networking seem to be the way of the 
future. 
Better editing and effects are new features of iMovie, 
in addition to the face detection iPhoto had. This isn’t incredibly spectacular, but it’s bet-
ter than nothing. 
GarageBand bulks up its “Les-
sons” feature so you can self-teach yourself guitar or piano with Ga-rageBand better than before. 
Using Flextime notes can now 
be manipulated, allowing for more creative freedom with less clicks.
Next up in my complete productivity derailment was 
FaceTime for the Mac. Can I get an “Amen”? 
With this, Apple might have just put themselves into 
direct competition with the videochat behemoth that is Skype.
Apple then stepped up its game and announced Lion 
10.7. 
Some notable features of this operating system in-
clude full-screen applications like Launchpad, Mission Control and, last but certainly not least, the App Store for the Mac. 
Finally, driving the stake in any hopes of my produc-
tivity, Apple made its MacBook Airs more compact and introduced a smaller netbook-like model. They’re still priced like Apples, unfortunately. You don’t get a dis-count on less materials here as the smaller model retails 
at $999, but for certain Apple users the Apple tax is one 
that’s worth paying.
Midterms still exist, but Apple’s Back to the Mac 
event gave me a few hours to forget about that and en-ter into a technological dream world.
Rest in peace, productivity. Sean Quinn is a first-year political science student. His 
column appears every Wednesday.
Not fondi 
of Bondi
Alligator endorses Gelber
If a voter wants experience in the race for top attorney in 
Florida, both the Republican and Democratic choice fits the bill. 
But if a voter wants common sense, only one candidate for 
Florida attorney general should collect votes: Dan Gelber. 
In an election to unseat Republican Attorney General Bill 
McCollum who (again) lost his bid to seek higher office when the charmingly fraudulent Rick Scott essentially paid him to quiet down, Dan Gelber presents an experienced, fresh view on Florida law and order. Pam Bondi, Gelber’s opponent, presents more or less the status quo of her predecessor. 
And the status quo in Florida isn’t pretty.McCollum initiated a frivolous state challenge to the his-
toric health care bill, which as any lawmaker should know, trumps state law. 
Bondi wants to continue this challenge of “Obamacare,” 
citing its according-to-her unconstitutional elements while ig-noring the Supremacy Clause that trumps state law. 
McCollum also hired a secretly gay expert witness, George 
Rekers, to testify in support of Florida’s one-of-a-kind gay adoption ban. Even after a court ruled the ban that barred openly gay parents from adopting one of the 20,000 children awaiting homes in Florida unconstitutional, McCollum still wasn’t sure if he would appeal or not.
Meaning, he wasn’t sure if his personal beliefs of him dis-
liking gays a whole heck of a lot would interfere with his im-partiality of the law.
Eventually, on the last day possible, McCollum decided not 
to challenge the court’s ruling.
Bondi has consistently declined to answer if she favors or 
opposes the ban on gay adoptions, but a Florida Times-Union article this month says Bondi would have also appealed. 
Conversely, Gelber opposes challenging the health care bill 
and rightfully refuses to challenge the court’s ruling on gay 
adoption.
Gelber pledges to protect Florida’s pension fund and di-
rectly take on Wall Street to protect the citizens of Florida from 
any wrongdoing. 
Gelber has a strong plan to protect our state’s children 
from online predators, including educating teachers on prop-er safeguarding methods and creating a new law that makes it illegal for registered sex offenders to use social networking websites. 
Bondi, on the other hand, has no information on her cam-
paign website on how she will protect Florida’s children. 
Bondi’s commitment to lessening the effects of the BP oil 
spill also leaves a bit to be desired. A portion of her official statement reads, “I am certain that the great people of our state will continue to be innovative and resourceful in responding to this disaster,” continuing to say she’ll advocate for them in a vaguely worded “any way possible.”
This leaves us wondering if she plans on leaving the mess 
to be handled solely by these great people. Gelber, on the other hand, said he will work vigorously to ensure Florida is a party to all possible claims arising from the spill.
While both candidates for Florida’s attorney general have 
great amounts of experience, only one candidate can truly and effective represent the common sense Floridians need now.
For Florida attorney general, the Alligator endorses Dan 
Gelber.

Letters to the Editor
Meek not right for endorsement
It’s time to stop pretending to be “indepen-
dent.” What a surprise the Editorial Board en-
dorses Kendrick Meek and Alex Sink for sena-tor and governor respectively . 
This is the Meek who lobbied for millions of 
taxpayer dollars for his Boston developer bud-dy Dennis Stackhouse while Stackhouse gave his mother an Escalade and free rent and was later arrested for stealing investment money. This is the Meek who worked for Wackenhut Corp. while it was committing fraud against Miami-Dade County and while he was a state legislator. This is the Meek who is called “ei-ther clueless or worse.”  
Sink’s endorsement is legitimate, and the 
argument was fair, although Sink was on the state board that was cited in an outside audit as “lacking oversight” and “allowing” risky investments that lost billions of dollars. 
But don’t insult our intelligence with claims 
like Kendrick Meek is someone who “speaks up for what’s right.”

Voters should watch Monday’s
 gubernatorial debate before voting
While I was not shocked that the Alligator endorsed Alex Sink for governor, I was dis-
appointed. Instead of explaining the issues it agreed with Sink on, it spent the entire edito-rial bashing Rick Scott, making a number of false statements about his campaign.
First, the statement he would do every-
thing in his power to take away rights from immigrants is false. He selected Jennifer Car -
roll as his running mate, a woman who actu-
ally immigrated to this country at the age of 
8 from Trinidad. Mr. Scott supports measures to help secure our border and is against illegal immigration, not legal immigration.
Characterizing him as an anti-immigrant is 
unfair and misleading.
Additionally, the endorsement notes Scott’s 
past business history but makes no mention of questionable business decisions Alex Sink 
made as president of NationsBank, and as a 
board member of Sykes Enterprise or how she failed as the “fiscal watchdog” of the state as CFO the past four years.
Finally, the notion that Rick Scott seems 
afraid to confront his opponents in public de-
bates is laughable. Monday night, he partici-
pated in a nationally televised debate on CNN against Sink and more than held his own.  Sink on the other hand, broke debate rules by re-ceiving a text message from her campaign staff during a commercial break.
I would encourage all voters to watch Monday Night’s debate online and evaluate both candidates in more detail before casting their ballot.

Now’s not the time for high-speed rail
In theory, the high-speed rail line linking 
Orlando to Tampa is a great idea. In practice, there are many more roadblocks the state of Florida needs to pass before the railway is even plausible. 
To start, the additional $800 million re-
ceived from the federal government is $300 million short of what is actually necessary to complete construction.
I agree with the Kristin Klein, president of 
College Democrats, that for the railway to be most effective, travelers have to be able to get to and from the railroad station easily. 
Orlando is a large city and current public 
transportation is subpar. Locating the sta-tion where there would actually be parking would 
take it far away from tourist attractions 
like Disney World, while the construction necessary on Interstate 4 alone would cause a tremendous  ruckus to commuters until the project is finished.
Yes, it would create more jobs. Yes, it 
would help the environment, but until plans are actually in the works to extend it all the way to Miami, where there is the most clutter, traffic and tourists, it isn’t worth the hassle it will produce.

Columnist a Republican automaton
Stephanie Strasser criticizes the “life-
changing” results of the 2008 presidential election, but then resorts to the same rhet-oric used by the 2008 Obama campaign, telling Americans that we should “vote for 
a change.”
The fact is, Florida’s conservative can-
didates in the upcoming election are con-
cerned mainly with furthering their own political careers at the expense of Florid-
ians’ rights and our state’s well-being. 
The fact that her argument strictly fol-
lows party lines shows she obviously 
hasn’t done her research into why these candidates should be maligned.
Nick Osborne

It’s a shame after nearly four years here, I’ve yet to see any-
thing unexpected come out of the editorial page of this newspaper. Tuesday’s not-quite-glowing endorsement of 
Alex Sink drew yet another yawn.
And, sadly, it even contained the same age-old talking 
points Alex Sink’s makeup artist gives her when she can’t come up with her own. “Rick Scott is a crook. Rick Scott has no ex-perience. Rick Scott hates gays, Mexicans, the environment and small furry adorable animals.”
Let’s start with the bad about Rick Scott. He headed a com-
pany that (after he left) settled a Medicare fraud case. Never mind that the “fraud” was a result of changes in medical stan-dards that occurred under the Clinton administration and that the same practices were legal just months before the accusa-
tions occurred. And never mind that Scott was a mergers and 
acquisitions lawyer with no health care background who gave his 400 hospital administrators substantial autonomy to run their business. And never mind that Scott only left the compa-ny because he, unlike his board of direc-tors, wanted to fight the accusations and prove the company’s innocence rather than settle. 
 Obviously, Rick Scott is a crook.
 But would Scott be a good governor? Probably.
True, we haven’t seen him in political office. We’ve just seen 
him in the business world where he took a company from the ground up and turned it into the largest hospital company in the world, creating thousands of jobs in the process. Yes, his company had some problems going on beneath him. What company (or government) doesn’t? 
It’s quite a step above running the state’s pension fund into 
the ground and then promising the unions to protect their hi-
lariously exorbitant benefits
. The best thing going for Scott right now, and the reason 
I’m voting for him, is he wants to promote responsible fiscal 
policy and small government. He wants to rein in the state pen-sion funds that are slowly bankrupting the state, so the public service unions (including the Police Benevolent Association) hate him. He wants to continue to improve Florida’s education by holding teachers accountable and ending “tenure,” so the teachers unions hate him. He wants to rein in the state “gravy 
train” and end earmarks and wasteful spending, so the politi-
cal establishment and the media elite hate him. If he were rock-ing my boat, I’d hate him too.
Don’t get me wrong — Rick Scott isn’t perfect. He has some 
shady history (who in office doesn’t?) and a lack of elected ex-perience. We don’t exactly know what to expect from him, and I don’t think he’ll be the second coming of Jeb Bush. But he’s proven himself to be a strong leader capable of managing a large organization, and he has the right ideas for Florida.
The Alligator’s editorial did get one thing right — the gov-
ernor’s race this year is slim pickings. But as usual, this news-paper picked wrong.

Inspired by their son, Narottam, an autistic child, 
Marie Trempe and Rob Cecil opened Autism Oa-sis for kids school in High Springs.
The couple hoped to improve Narottam’s life and 
the lives of other children affected by autism.
Each student is limited in different ways.  Some 
struggle with speech, listening and interaction, oth-ers with simple things such as making eye contact or laughing.
Autism gives children mental blocks that hold 
them back from reacting to what they feel or hear. Instructors at the school use music, vigorous move-ments and deep physical contact, such as laying on top, strong hugs and massages, to motivate the chil-dren to react.
At the Oasis, children particpate in games and 
activities designed to help them. Below, Narottam, completes his classwork work while fellow student Jacob cheers in the background during class at Au-tism Oasis.

TECHNOLOGY
By MICHAEL SYKES
Alligator Contributing Writer
While some see electronic 
books streamlining education 
in the near future, some UF stu-
dents and faculty are hesitant to 
digitize learning.
“I’m old-fashioned,” said 
Stacey Stiles, a 23-year-old his-
tory major. “I like to carry books 
with me, but it gets heavy.”
Stiles is one of many students 
who have used e-textbooks this year. She said she likes the con-
venience of having an e-text-
book and even accesses them on her phone while she is in class, but it can be frustrating.
“If the Internet is slow, and 
I’m trying to access the book on-
line, it takes forever,” she said. 
Catherine Cavanaugh, an 
associate professor of educa-
tion, has conducted research on 
blended and online education 
and encourages the incorpora-tion of e-texts into the learning 
experience.  
“I’m not advocating for an 
automated course experience,” she said. “But society is mov-ing toward e-texts, and it makes sense.”
But some desire a more 
hands-on learning experience, 
she said. 
“People want as authentic a 
learning experience as is pos-
sible,” she said. “They want 
something very close to real-
ity.”
Michelle Jacobs, a  professor 
at the Frederic G. Levin College of Law, said she believes that 
while technology offers great potential and opportunities to students, it can also serve as a 
distraction.  
“In a class of over 100 stu-
dents it’s impossible to moni-tor how students are using the 
technology ,” she said. “In the past, some students have even 
been caught looking at pornog-
raphy in class.”E-books get mixed

In honor of Breast Cancer Awareness Month, 
the sisters of alpha Kappa Delta Phi are hosting 
a week filled with events and activities to raise money for the Breast Cancer Crusade, sponsored by the Avon Foundation for Women. The activi-
ties started Monday and will last through Thurs-
day. 
Alpha Kappa Delta Phi kicked off the week at 
10 a.m. Monday with their “Pie-a-KDPhi” event, in which students were able to pie a sister with a donation to the breast cancer organization. 
The week continues with a poker tournament, 
a breast cancer forum and a community service event for the American Cancer Society’s Winn Di-xie Hope Lodge.
On Thursday, they will present their Beat Can-
cer Charity Carnival, which will feature booths represented by organizations including Heal the World, Health Occupations Students of America, American Medical Student Association, Pharma-
cists Without Borders, Reitz Union Board Enter -
tainment and Asian American Student Union. 
The carnival, which begins at 7 p.m. at the Reitz 
Union North Terrace, will have games and prizes 
and tickets will be exchanged for donations. Activities fight breast cancer

In an effort to accommodate stu-
dents with food allergies, Gator Dining 
Services has made some changes this year to the food products offered on campus and in dining halls. 
According to Jill Rodriguez, market-
ing program manager for Gator Dining Services, residential dining halls are offering gluten-free products for free 
upon request.
“We are able to offer many items 
in our convenience stores that are glu-
ten-free, including pizza 
dough, frozen and micro-waveable meals, brown-ies, cookies, muffins, 
tortillas and breads,”  Rodriguez  said. “We have a vendor that offers gluten-
free items, and we asked them to pro-vide a full inventory of products as well 
as their top 25 items.”
Rodriguez said that while there has 
been increased participation in the con-venience stores, such participation has been slower at the dining halls.
Meaghan Renkey , a freshman 
with Celiac disease, said Gator Dining 
Serivces’ accommodations make it pos-
sible to find gluten-free food options.
“Overall, I think Gator Dining Ser -
vices is helpful with accommodating food needs,” Renkey said. UF food focus shifts to allergies“I like to carry books 
with me, but it gets 
heavy.”

 THE GATORS WILL BE ON            
NATIONAL TV FOR THE SECOND STRAIGHT WEEK.  
By MATT RUBIN
 Alligator Writer
   
 Being one of the best in college volleyball 
will earn a team extra attention — especially if 
that team is atop the rankings.
  No. 1 Florida (18-1, 11-0 Southeastern Con-
ference) will play on national television for the 
second straight week when it hosts South Car-olina (5-16, 2-9 SEC) tonight in the O’Connell Center at 7. The game will air on ESPNU.
  “It has been terriﬁ  c to see the amount of 
television coverage for women’s volleyball 
this year,” coach Mary Wise said. “It’s hard to 
go two days in a row without seeing a match. It is terriﬁ  c exposure for our sport.”
  The Gators are ranked No. 1 for the third 
week in a row. It also marks the 300th straight week of being ranked in the top 25.
  After defeating Tennessee on ESPNU last 
week, the Gators will try to stay undefeated in SEC play and increase publicity for volleyball, 
both at the same time.
  “If you’re a young boy and you’re play-
ing the sport of football and basketball, how many opportunities do you have to turn on 
the TV and see players that you can try and 
emulate?” Wise said. “Now we’re ﬁ  nally in a 
situation where young girls that are just decid-ing whether they want to try volleyball, now they can turn on the TV and see some terriﬁ  c 
talent.
  “It’s huge for our sport and great for our 
program that back-to-back weeks we’ll be 
on ESPNU, that’s a lot of homes that get that channel.”
  The Gators lead the Gamecocks 42-7 in the 
all-time series. The only time South Carolina defeated UF in Gainesville was in 1986 — be-
fore Wise was coach.
  South Carolina is last in the SEC in hitting 
percentage and opponent hitting percentage. 
However, Wise expects them to play an in-tense match.
  “We play a South Carolina team that was 
young to begin with and they’ve had a num-ber of injuries, so they’ve used a lot of different 
lineups,” Wise said. “Even though the person-
nel has changed, what hasn’t changed is that South Carolina plays really hard. They’ve al-ways been a very good defensive team. They may not lead the league in blocks, but they’re going to dig a lot of balls and create effort stats.”
  South Carolina’s Hannah Lawing leads the 
SEC in digs with 371 total and 4.95 per set.
  With one month left in the regular season, 
the Gators are getting closer to winning an-other SEC title. But they aren’t getting too far ahead of themselves.
  “We need to focus one game at a time,” se-
nior libero Erin Fleming said. “We look ahead and we know what’s ahead but we stay fo-
cused on what we need to do to become a bet-
ter team from now until December.”
  South Carolina is the only SEC team UF has 
not played yet this season.  14, ALLIGATOR  WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 27, 2010

 UF takes on South Carolina in front of national audience  By MATT WATTS
 Alligator Writer
   
 A new practice schedule allowed the Gators to take some 
extra time off this week, and it couldn’t have come at a bet-
ter time.
  Working diligently to create a foundation for the road 
ahead started to take its toll on coach Amanda Butler’s 
squad, and she said the break was a welcome sight to both 
her and her players.
  “It’s just little nagging, pesky things [injuries] time is re-
ally the only thing that can cure (them),” Butler said. “Hope-fully those things we will get 100 percent and we’ll really ﬁ  gure out what we look like when we’ve got 12 healthy folks on the ﬂ  oor.”
  Forward Deaundra Young is still recovering from offsea-
son surgery that has limited her range of motion. A number 
of other players are dealing with muscle strains and pulls, Butler said.
  However, senior center Ebonie Crawford will require 
closer observation after sustaining a concussion in practice 
during the week.
  “[She] took a fantastic charge and just made my heart 
happy,” Butler said.
  Crawford’s head struck the ﬂ  oor at the conclusion of the 
play, and she’ll be evaluated before being cleared to prac-
tice.
  Crawford may ﬁ  nd herself in catch-up mode when she returns, as Butler said the practices will begin to feature 
more in-depth strategy as the season approaches.
  The coaching staff has been focusing more on mental 
aspects than game-planning so far, but Butler said that will change this week.
  “What we’ve been trying to instill in them and get from 
them is how we’re going to compete, what type of competi-
tors are we,” Butler said. “You do have to address the details 
at some point. There’s still a lot to do.”
  Butler and her players used Saturday’s off day to par-
ticipate in the ﬁ  fth annual Brandon Ling Memorial Sports 
Camp at the UF Sports Complex. The event is sponsored by 
the Climb for Cancer Foundation — a not-for-proﬁ  t founda-tion that raises money to help families who have children 
battling cancer. 
  “They were excited about the chance to be involved and 
give back to the community and hopefully impact some spe-
cial people in some special ways,” Butler said.  Revised practice schedule allows Gators to heal injuriesUF WOMEN’S BASKETBALL
 “It’s just little nagging, pesky [injuries] that 
time is really the only thing that can cure

  THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
    
 COLUMBIA, Mo. — A new 
study suggests that the so-called 
“free ride” for college scholarship athletes isn’t quite so free.
  The report by Ithaca College re-
searchers and a national athletes’ ad-vocacy group shows that the average “full scholarship” Division I athlete winds up having to pay $2,951 an-nually in school-related expenses not covered by grants-in-aid.
  The shortfall represents the differ-
ence between educational expenses like tuition, student fees, room and board, and ancillary costs not cov-ered by scholarships, from campus 
parking fees to calculators and com-
puter disks required for classes.
  At some schools, the shortfall can 
approach or exceed tuition costs. At Arkansas-Little Rock, for instance, the 2009 shortfall is nearly $11,000, said Ramogi Huma, a former UCLA linebacker who now heads the Na-tional College Players Association.
  “It’s really deceptive to use the 
words ‘full scholarship,’” 
he said. “There’s 
never an expla-
nation for recruited athletes that the price tag for attending school falls short of the scholarship amount.”
  The school disputed that num-ber, suggesting its gap between ath-letic scholarships and the cost of at-tendance is closer to $4,100 a year.
  College athletes whose academic 
expenses aren’t fully covered by scholarships are more susceptible to the inﬂ  uence of money-wielding sports agents, Huma suggested. In a recent Sports Illustrated report, a former agent said he paid more than 30 college football players from 1990-96. Seven of the athletes con-ﬁ  rmed that account.
  “The amounts of money he talk-
ed about giving these players falls 
within the scholarship shortfalls,” 
Huma said. “These players are put-ting everything on the line to get a few bucks in order to make ends meet ... and to meet their basic ne-cessities.
  “If they were to fully fund schol-
arships, there would be less tempta-tion.” 
 Athletic scholarships don’t cover full costs of college
socks.
But the seventh-best running 
back in the nation (according to Ri-
vals.com) wasn’t always sure he’d end up at Florida. He said that dur -
ing the recruitment process he was constantly going back and forth be-tween UF and Auburn.
“At one point it was Auburn, 
90-10 (percent),” Blakely said. “I started talking to both coaches, started talking to all the coaches and weighing my options, looking at what I think would be best for 
me. I went to Auburn on an official 
and I loved it there. Then I went to Florida on an unofficial and I loved it there. … If it wasn’t Florida, it would be Auburn. If it wasn’t Au-burn, it would be Florida.”
The tipping point for the cov-
eted recruit came after Florida’s 33-29 loss to LSU on Oct. 9. Blakely 
was in The Swamp for the game, 
and even though the Gators lost, the running back left his unofficial visit impressed with the gameday atmosphere and told his mom he knew he wanted to spend the next four years at UF. 
Blakely said he privately com-
mitted to Florida’s coaches last Wednesday and also informed those closest to him, including some teammates, friends and his 
position coach, Rod Frazier, who 
played fullback at UF from 1996-2000. When Blakely informed Fra-zier, who he said was like a brother, father and uncle to him, the former Gator welcomed the running back to the Florida family.
“I know he walked in my office 
every day and he saw the orange 
and blue,” Frazier said. “But I also 
made sure to know that I wanted him to do the best thing for Mike. ‘Don’t let me play a part of this, do what’s best for you.’”
Despite committing a week ago, 
Blakely and Manatee coach Joe Kinnan thought it would be best to hold off on an announcement until after the team’s game last Friday against rival Sarasota Riverview High because they didn’t want the decision to be a distraction. 
In that game, Blakely displayed 
his versatility on offense in front of a crowd that included UF coach 
Urban Meyer and offensive coordi-
nator Steve Addazio. The running back racked up two rushing touch-downs and also threw a 32-yard touchdown pass in Manatee’s 35-6 win.
“Just watching Florida on TV , 
they’re struggling in the run-ning back position,” Kinnan said. 
“They’ve got some speed guys in 
(Chris) Rainey and (Jeff) Demps, and they got (Emmanuel) Moody, who’s more of a power guy. I think Mike is the total package. He can run inside and run outside.”
Kinnan also praised Blakely’s 
ability to throw the ball, saying that if the running back was a few 
inches taller, he’d be able to play 
quarterback for a Division-I school because he has the arm for it. On the season, Blakely has completed all three of his passes for touch-downs.
That skill set explains why UF 
coaches told the 5-foot-9, 194-pound back that they plan to use him simi-
larly to how they used Percy Har -
vin during his time at Florida.
Regardless of how the Gators 
intend to utilize him, Blakely plans 
on working hard to help the team in any way he can — even it means playing defense.
But before Blakely, who is con-sidering enrolling at UF in January, 
can try to help the Gators on the 
field, he will try to help them off it.
With his commitment solidified, 
he’s done visiting other schools and will focus on another highly touted recruit — four-star Lake City Co-lumbia High defensive tackle Tim-my Jernigan, who is still weighing his college options.
“I’m gonna start talking to Tim 
because I heard he’s a pretty good person,” Blakely said. “And I don’t want him tackling me.”

� THE SENIOR FINISHED THE 
TOURNEY AT 4-UNDER PAR.
By MATT WATTS
Alligator Writer
 
After trailing by 12 shots, the No. 3 Gators 
had an unexpected chance to win Tuesday 
thanks to the outstanding performance of their senior leader.
Bank Vongvanij won the individual title 
after firing a 4-under 68 in the final round at the Isleworth Collegiate Invitational, leading the UF men’s golf team to a third-place finish. 
The senior made six birdies on a comeback 
run from five shots back and finished with a 
total score of 212 (74-70-68, -4).
“I think Bank’s turning the page a little 
bit,” coach Buddy Alexander said. “He’s just become a different player.”
Vongvanij had five top-10 finishes last sea-
son but was inconsistent at times. He has fin-
ished in the top five of each tournament this season, including a second-place finish at the Olympia Fields Invitational.
“As long as he keeps hitting those fairways, 
he’s going to be hard to beat,” Alexander said. 
Unfortunately for the rest of the Gators, 
missing the fairway was a frequent occurrence Tuesday.
Three UF golfers shot 80 or higher on the 
final 18 — effectively canceling the under-par gems shot by Vongvanij and sophomore Phil-lip Choi.
Choi fired five birdies Tuesday en route to 
a 2-under 70 and an eighth-place overall finish at 220 (78-72-70, +4). He strung together bird-ies at the par-5 seventh and the challenging 465-yard, par-4 eighth.
Choi was the only UF golfer without a dou-
ble bogey on his scorecard at the 7,544-yard Isleworth Golf and Country Club on Tuesday.
“I don’t care how hard a golf course is, you 
still can’t give [shots] away two and three at a time,” Alexander said. “That’s an area we’ll 
work hard to correct. When 
you look back in retrospect, we 
actually could have won this 
golf tournament today.”
However, scoring proved 
difficult for everyone in the fi-
nal round, and the Gators’ 11-over score was 
third-best among all teams and two strokes 
better than eventual winner Alabama.
UF climbed two spots to finish third behind 
the Crimson Tide and LSU.
The chance to win was there — UF simply needed average rounds from two other golf-ers, Alexander said.
But consistent sophomore Tyler McCum-
ber started rough with bogeys at the second and fifth holes. Trying to push the pace and get back in the red, McCumber faltered with consecutive double bogeys at eight and nine.  
An 8-over-par 80 on Tuesday was his first 
tournament round in the 80s since March and brought his total to 229 (76-73-80, +13), good for 37th individually.
Tommy Mou and Michael Furci both card-
ed 9-over rounds of 81, finishing tied for 51st and 57th, respectively . 
“We were 6-under for two guys and 17-over 
for the other two,” Alexander said. “That’s just 
too big a discrepancy. I’m not happy with that. 
There’s some things we can do to help correct that.”Vongvanij wins individual title; UF finishes in third
Blakely informed Gators coaches of decision last Wednesday
RECRUIT , from page 16Golf
Meyer was branded as a coach who cared more about score-
boards than off-the-field discipline. And, if you believe that, 
you’ll love this symmetry: In what looks to be his worst season by means of wins and losses, Meyer handled Rainey’s arrest 
about as well he could have.
Rainey was charged with aggravated stalking. He sent a 
stupid text message to a female “acquaintance.” She asked that 
formal charges not be pressed, saying she wasn’t threatened. He was, in the days following the arrest, “not part of this foot-ball team,” according to UF coaches. His charge was reduced from a felony to a misdemeanor. He was told he could return, assuming he could follow certain rules, most notably keeping his foot far away from his mouth.
In the end, Rainey serves about a five-game suspension.The punishment is appropriate. The offense was not major. 
The victim testified that she never actually felt threatened and that the police were called merely to defuse the situation.
That’s not to say he shouldn’t have been punished. Again, 
he told a woman that it was time to die. Even if Rainey’s inten-tions weren’t serious, they were at least stupid and required the police’s concern.
And, other than on-field success, fans know Rainey best for 
saying really dumb things. He said he disliked his sex class two years ago because it wasn’t “like you see on TV .” And before this season he said the team had rid itself of all the prima don-nas who poisoned last year’s squad.
Sure, he’s in college, where you’re supposed to have fun and make minor mistakes and grow outrageous beards and, 
occasionally , say stupid things to girls (or boys, or both). But, 
at 22 years old, Rainey should have outgrown this phase. The immature comments were fun and even endearing, but he was justifiably punished because of it.
At the same time, the charges were reduced upon further 
review. The reaction to Rainey’s late-night creeping was more severe because it happened to be No. 31 on the “Gators in more-orange, less-blue jumpsuits” chart since 2005.
But that’s unfair. Would Rainey have faced less scrutiny if 
his text message resulted in charge No. 3? What if it was charge No. 103?
Fans will probably (read: definitely) watch yet another play-
er with a criminal record on the field Saturday . And while the Gators covet him for his speed, his return was not rushed.

Chris Rainey could see a lot of touches 
out of the backfield Saturday against Geor -
gia, but he needs earn playing time first.
With Jeff Demps, Mike Gillislee and Em-
manuel Moody all recovering from injuries, 
Florida offensive coordinator Steve Addazio 
said Rainey, who was suspended from the 
team following his arrest for aggravated stalking, could take some carries against the Bulldogs. 
Rainey was a running back for his first 
two seasons at UF before moving to receiver this year.
“Certainly the possibility exists for (Rain-
ey to play running back) because of inju-
ries,” Addazio said. “Chris is a guy that’s a 
very talented guy, that’s versatile, can do a lot of things. Of course, he’s still in the pro-cess right now. He’s still following his course of events to be cleared to play. So that’s still 
in the process, but he does give you some 
versatility, for sure, assuming he’s ready to go.”
Rainey returned to the practice facilities 
Oct. 10 but was not available to play in the loss to Mississippi State.  
Omarius Hines, who had been used at 
wide receiver and tight end, carried the ball six times against MSU due to Florida’s 
banged-up backfield. 
Rainey has rushed 178 times for 1,253 
yards (7.04 yards per carry) in his career, 
but Addazio doesn’t want to assume he can 
effortlessly return to the backfield. Rainey 
needs more work this week if he wants to be effective come Saturday. 
“He’s getting reps in practice and obvi-
ously getting even more because some guys are dinged up a little bit, and you just hope that everything works out right,” Addazio 
said.
Execution problems: The buzz word 
around the Gators’ offensive players and coaches is execution. 
The team believes the right plays and 
players are on the field to win games, but 
the occasional missed assignment has led to 
struggles. 
Addazio said the team is giving every-
thing it has during practice and in games but 
is still coming up short. 
“There’s a difference between effort and 
execution,” Addazio said. “We have great effort right now. We want to get better in ex-ecution.”
In order to execute well frequently, Add-
azio said every player needs to do his job on every play. If one person misses a block, runs the wrong route or doesn’t take care of the ball, it hurts the entire unit. 
“If one player messes up, that kind of 
messes up everything,” senior wide receiver Carl Moore said. “So right now we’re just trying to work on practicing, making sure everyone is doing everything right at the 
same time.”

BRADENTON — After keep-
ing his college choice a secret from 
the public for six days, Mike Blakely wasted no time making his decision 
known Tuesday morning.
In a press conference at Bradenton 
Manatee High, the four-star running 
back announced his commitment to Florida, making him the 18th member of the Gators’ 2011 class.
“I felt like I made the best decision 
for me,” Blakely said.Wearing a red warm-up jacket 
and pants, Blakely, who narrowed his choices down to UF and Auburn, 
didn’t hesitate to announce his deci-sion, quickly reach-ing into his back-pack and pulling 
out a Gators cap.
On Tuesday, 
Blakely was all UF — literally. Af-
ter donning the hat, he removed the warm-ups to reveal a head-to-toe Gators outfit, complete with UF Blakely commits to UFRainey’s situation handled correctly
Chris Rainey will probably see the field 
Saturday. That’s not a guarantee. Don’t take it to the bank. Like anything related 
to the UF football team, fans won’t actually know until the game starts.
Maybe that sucks. Maybe you hate it. But 
it’s the way things are handled.
Having said that, Chris Rainey will see the 
field Saturday. He’ll play because the Florida offense, among other things, needs big plays, needs quote-unquote explosssssssive playmak-ers. 
But try to keep it in your pants. Just because 
he’s back doesn’t mean the classic crush-your-soul, hang-half-a-hundred, pillage-your-cam-pus, steal-your-women offense that makes the 
Boys of Old Florida so proud has returned.
In the game and a half Rainey played before 
suffering a concussion and informing a love in-
terest that it was, in fact, time to die (or maybe “dine”... stupid T9 texting), the junior account-ed for 50 yards from scrimmage, or about 34 per game.
And the Florida of-
fense as a whole wasn’t 
taking any prisoners 
with Rainey in the slot. The team gained 369 to-tal yards (246 per game) and scored 41 points (27.3 per game) in those 90 minutes of grinding 
football.
But Rainey was not held out because of foot-
ball-related issues, and his return should not be evaluated in that light, either. Rainey , and the 
other 25 players who have been arrested dur -
ing Urban Meyer’s tenure in the Swamp, didn’t 
create “The University of Felons” after running wild on the field.“Chris is a guy that’s a very tal -
ented guy, that’s versatile, can do 
a lot of things.”
