As Gainesville voters begin to 
head for the polls for city elec-
tions, political activists vie to get 
in the last word.
Early voting begins today and 
will run through Saturday. Ballots 
may be cast at the County Admin-
istration Building, 12 S.E. First St., from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. each day. On election day, March 24, voters will report to their precinct’s polling 
place.“We’re just making sure we get 
that final push before the vote,” 
said Eric Conrad, a spokesman for 
Equality is Gainesville’s Business, 
an anti-Amendment 1 organiza-tion.
The amendment would nullify 
Chapter 8 of the Gainesville Code of Ordinances, titled “Discrimina-tion.” Instead, protections would be provided by the Florida Civil Rights Act at the state level.
In effect, this would remove 
protected status for transgen-der, lesbian, gay and bisexual Gainesville residents and loosen protections for other classes.
On Saturday, about 50 people 
gathered at the Pride Community Center on Northwest 13th  Street to prepare people to discuss 
Amendment 1 with voters. Vol-unteers watched as group leaders 
demonstrated how to canvass.
The group then split up to 
knock on the doors of Gainesville voters. Volunteers have done this during several previous week-ends, but this was definitely the 
largest group so far, according to 
Conrad.
The anti-amendment group 
will also offer free van rides to student voters from the Reitz 
Union to the County Administra-
tion Building this week, an effort similar to those orchestrated dur-ing the November elections.
Citizens for Good Public Poli-
cy, the pro-amendment group, is 
busy approaching voters as well.
“We are doing all the tradi-
tional campaign get-out-the-vote 
activities, which include radio, 
TV, and print media,” wrote Jim 
Gilbert, a Citizens spokesman, in an e-mail. 
“In addition we have vol-
unteers on the ground walking 
neighborhoods and holding ‘YES 
on 1’ signs at key locations,” he said.LOCALEarly voting in city elections begins today

� INVESTIGATORS DETERMINED THE

The cause of a fire that claimed local non-
profit Peaceful Paths’ headquarters and part of 
a physician’s office will remain 
undetermined barring any signifi-
cant developments, officials said.
Gainesville Fire Rescue inves-
tigators have exhausted all avail-
able resources in determining how the build-
ing, which served victims of domestic violence, caught fire, according to a GFR press release.
Investigators were able to determine that the 
fire started in the training room of the Peaceful Paths building, but the extent of the damage 
prevented any further insight.
“Unfortunately, there are times when we are 
unable to determine a cause, which can be very 
frustrating to both the victims and our person-nel,” said Tim Hayes, deputy fire chief, accord-ing to the release.
Peaceful Paths has continued to provide 
services while relocating to a temporary office space and has experienced significant commu-
nity support in its time of need, according to the 
Peaceful Paths Web site.GFR officials

Inmates find trash bags full of pot
OCALA (AP) — Authorities are trying 
to figure out who dropped four 55-gallon 
trash bags filled with marijuana by the side of an Ocala road.
The Marion County Sheriff’s Office re-
ports that inmates working with the coun-ty’s solid waste department found the bags on Thursday. Drug agents say the bags weighed a total of nearly 65 pounds.
Officials are investigating where the 
bags came from.� For a photo

John Sikorski is an accidental 
antiquesman.
Sikorski, an Ocala antiques ap-
praiser who hosts a weekly radio 
show called “Sikorski’s Attic” on 
WUFT, said that though he has 
been interested in antiques all his life, he “fell” into the business about 30 years ago.
“It was literally an accident,” he 
said. “I never set out to be in this business.”
Sikorski said it all started when 
his wife started studying engineer-
ing at UF. He was returning to Oc-
ala from Gainesville after a prom-ising second job interview with 
Blue Cross and Blue Shield when 
he made a stop.
“Up on I-75, there was this 
big, red antique store,” he said. “I had some spare time, so I decided to just stop in and see what was there.”
The store’s owner was there, 
and he and Sikorski talked about 
his experience.
“We got to talking, and I told 
him about the job. He said, ‘Well, 
it’d be better if you’d come to work for me here,’” he said. “So he hired me on the spot.”
The store was Wayside An-
tiques, and Sikorski worked there for about 10 years, during which 
time he picked up valuable experi-ence, he said.
Sikorski then opened his own 
antique shop, which he ran un-
til he opened his appraisal office about 10 years ago.
He decided to begin appraising 
after he realized that the buying and selling of antiques wasn’t as lucrative as it once was.
“Along came the Internet, and 
you no longer needed to have a re-tail store,” he said. “But there are 
a lot of people out there who have 
things but have no way of finding out what they’re worth.”
In addition to “Sikorski’s Attic” 
and his downtown appraisal office, a tangled mix of eclectic findings and books from which he studies to stay up-to-date on the business, he writes question-and-answer 
columns for the Gainesville Sun, 
the Ocala Star-Banner and the Cit-rus County Chronicle.
Sikorski also provides a walk-
through service for people who want many items in their houses appraised.
“It’s a conversation about 
things in their homes with regard 
to collector interest and dollar val-ues,” he said, adding that he also offers advice on how best to sell 
antiques.
Despite having traveled the 
world collecting and studying an-tiques, Sikorski said he never loses interest because of the variety of items he comes across.
So far, Sikorski said, the most 
interesting item he has come 
across is a footlong hardened wal-
rus penis, called an usik, which sits in a glass case in his office. Smiling impishly, he held out the item for examination before explaining its significance.
“From one minute to the next, 
you never know what’s going to come in. It’s always different,” he 
said. “I love it all.”

CAPE CANAVERAL— Space shuttle Dis-
covery and its crew of seven rocketed into orbit 
Sunday evening, setting off on a space station construction mission cut short by launch de-
lays that dragged on for more than a month.
Discovery rose from its seaside pad just as the sun was setting, a spectacular sight for a 
space agency anxious to get the flight going. As the shuttle sped away like a brilliant star, part of the launch plume glowed pink, peach 
and golden. The shuttle was visible for several 
minutes.
A hydrogen leak prevented Discovery 
from lifting off Wednesday and, before that, hydrogen valves kept the shuttle grounded for weeks in February. Launch pad repairs took care of the leak, and the astronauts were able to board their spaceship and lift off.“Well, you had a little bit of a wait, but that 
will just make the payoff that much sweeter,” launch director Mike Leinbach told the astro-nauts.
Commander Lee Archam-
bault and his crew, which includes two former school-teachers, should reach the inter-
national space station Tuesday.
“Thanks for the work, Mike. We’ll see 
you in a couple weeks. Take care and let’s go ahead and fire up the sound of freedom,” Ar-chambault said.
They’re delivering one last set of solar 
wings for the space station and some critical equipment for a relatively new water-recy-
cling system.
No one was more eager to see Discovery 
take off than the three space station astronauts. 
Commander Mike Fincke was ecstatic when informed nothing was leaking at the pad.
“That is most excellent news,” Fincke told 
Mission Control. “That’s exactly what’s been on top of our minds.”AROUND GAINESVILLE‘Accidental antiquesman’ describes work, collection

The MacArthur Foundation awarded 
a $1 million grant last week to the Florida 
Partnership to preserve aging rental units in the state. 
Because of the recent foreclosure crisis, 
rental housing has become more impor-tant. And the real estate bubble’s burst makes it smarter to preserve aging hous-ing than to build new ones. This market shift guides the way Florida Partnership plans to use the donated funds.
“Traditionally the way Florida has 
dealt with affordable housing has been through new construction,” said Cecka 
Green, communications director for the 
Florida Housing Finance Corporation. “With the housing market, the bubble has burst, and there’s a lot of stock that’s al-ready out there. We are looking to prop-erly preserve units that are already built and have an affordability, because we don’t want to lose that.” 
About 71 percent of extremely low-
income renter households in Florida paid more than 40 percent of their income for rent in 2007, according to the MacArthur Foundation’s Web site.
The Florida Partnership includes the 
UF Shimberg Center for Housing Stud-ies, the Florida Housing Finance Corpo-ration and the Florida Housing Coalition. Florida was one of 12 cities and states to 
receive the foundation’s Window of Op-
portunity grant, which awarded $32.5 million to help agencies preserve more than 70,000 low-income rental homes na-tionwide.
The Florida Partnership aims to pre-serve 20,000 low-income rental units by 2019, focusing on seniors and people with disabilities, Green said.
The UF Shimberg Center will receive 
$500,000 to research and help the state decide what rental housing stock has a greater need for preservation. 
“We’re looking specifically at rental 
housing that’s privately owned and pub-licly subsidized,” said Anne Ray, a lead-ing researcher at the Shimberg Center. “Many of those properties are at risk of 
rising rents, demolition or 
at risk of losing subsidies 
from the government.”
The Shimberg Center 
will also research which tenants are most affected and the role private unsubsidized stock plays in providing affordable hous-ing to Florida’s communities, Ray said.
The Florida Housing Coalition was 
awarded $475,000 to educate and train 
state nonprofit organizations to acquire, 
rehabilitate and manage long-term af-fordable rental housing for extremely low-income populations, said Jaimie Ross, president of the Florida Housing Coalition.
The Florida Housing Finance Corpo-
ration was awarded $25,000 to support peer networking activities for nonprofit 
and for-profit developers to help them 
rehabilitate aging privately owned prop-erties with expiring subsidies.
“If those units don’t receive the proper 
attention that they need, we could lose a significant portion of our affordable hous-
ing stock,” Green said. “The MacArthur 
grant provides us with the catalyst we need to be moving in the right direction to achieve that goal.”$1M grant will repair 
aging rental homes

WASHINGTON  — America’s 
recession “probably” will end this 
year if the government succeeds in bolstering the banking system, Fed-
eral Reserve Chairman Ben Bernan-ke said Sunday in a rare television interview.
In carefully hedged remarks in a 
taped interview with CBS’ “60 Min-
utes,” Bernanke seemed to express a bit more optimism that this could be done.Still, Bernanke stressed — as 
he did to Congress last month — that the prospects for the recession ending this year and a recovery 
taking root next year hinge on a difficult task: getting banks to lend 
more freely again and getting the 
financial markets to work more normally.
“We’ve seen some progress in 
the financial markets, absolutely,” he said. “But until we get that stabi-lized and working normally, we’re 
not going to see recovery.
“But we do have a plan. We’re 
working on it. And, I do think that 
we will get it stabilized, and we’ll see the recession coming to an end probably this year.”

If Deborah Kenner has paper in front of 
her, she’s probably doodling.
While in class, the UF sophomore draws 
her name, flowers and squiggly designs while 
listening to lectures.
“I always pay attention,” Kenner said.Now she has evidence. According to a re-
cent study from the University of Plymouth in England, doodling can aid concentration and may prove beneficial in remembering infor-mation.
The study, published in late February, con-
sisted of two groups of 20 people — one in-structed to doodle, one not — who listened to 
a mock telephone message. Participants in the 
doodle group recalled 29 percent more than the participants in the non-doodle group.
Kenner said she was not surprised.“I’ve gone through stages when I’ve tried 
not to doodle, but it really just helps me pay attention more,” she said.Kenneth Heilman, a clinical professor of 
neurology and health psychology at UF, feels the same way.
“I’m a big doodler,” Heilman said. “If I 
don’t doodle, I fall asleep. Doodling keeps me 
alert and awake.”
Glen Finney, an assistant professor in UF’s 
department of neurology, doodles mazes and 
paisley-like patterns when listening to lectures. Doodling allows people to back away from 
strong thoughts and relax, allowing weaker 
brain connections to be activated, he said.
“That’s a way to find new ideas and not get 
locked into old ideas,” he said.
An example is when a student takes a test. 
Finney said when an answer keeps popping into a student’s head, but he know it’s wrong, 
he needs to relax and allow other brain con-
nections to activate in order to think of other possible answers.
“Doodling allows you to sort of be weakly 
aroused,” Finney said, “but it’s not so detain-ing that you’re highly aroused.”
Although he said some people use doo-
dling to keep themselves active and paying at-tention, others might use doodling as an outlet 
for their creative urges.
Kenner said she occasionally doodles out of 
boredom, but it’s on a whole different level.
“Those are more drawings than doodling,” 
she said. “I take out a whole piece of paper 
and stop paying attention.”STuDENT LIfEStudy suggests that doodling may aid in retention

Bottomless Break
Spring Break doesn’t 
have to end today.
Stewart puts Cramer in rightful place
Today’s question: Did you have a 
great Spring Break?Friday’s question: Have a great Spring Break!Column
Online news outlets apparently yanked their the-
sauruses out from beneath their beds last Thurs-day, labeling Jon Stewart’s interview of CNBC’s 
“Mad Money” host Jim Cramer with headlines such as “Stewart Eviscerates Cramer, CNBC,” and “Jon Stewart Thrashes Jim Cramer.”
Anyone who watched the interview knows that it 
wasn’t in typical Stewartesque fashion. The host of “The Daily Show” didn’t josh around with Cramer; he indig-nantly crucified him and his network.
Last Thursday Cramer became the regrettable face of 
everything that’s wrong with modern journalism, and 
worst yet, Stewart epitomized everything that’s right.
CNBC, with its programs and pundits that speculate 
on financial news, doesn’t seem to fully appreciate the 
power it holds in swaying consumer confidence and 
upholding the idea of Wall Street responsibility. They 
have championed the senseless idea that money can be instantaneous, or fast, or even mad — elevating the shady 3 a.m. easy-money infomercial to prime-time sta-tus and labeling it as American as apple pie.
But Stewart’s a populist. He may have mocked CN-
BC’s Rick Santelli’s live populist appeal to the traders on the floor of the Chicago Board of Trade, but by no means is “The Daily Show” a leader in social thought. 
The show is nothing more than the proverbial French 
radical who spots an angry mob passing by and says, “There go my people, I must find them so I can lead them.”
Today, the angry mob is pointing its pitchforks at the 
world of Wall Street and financial news networks, but yesterday they were ready to torch the regular news me-dia for not paying more attention to the flimsy case for war in Iraq. Even then, it was Stewart who led the bastion of ragtag flamethrowers, scolding 
Tucker Carlson and Paul Begala 
on the since-canceled CNN pro-gram “Crossfire” for denigrat-ing our political system into an 
obnoxious shouting match.
Something is seriously 
wrong when our nation’s court 
jester has to point out the fail-
ings of our political and financial leaders. But it’s no 
surprise that we’ve come to this point. The Internet has 
allowed anyone, even crazy people, to not only have an opinion but shout it out to the world. If you want, you could comment on this very column online, and then 
comment on a news article on nytimes.com. It’s no won-
der that the popularity of television opinion programs have exploded in recent years. Opining has become an art that anyone can practice, and it seems that news conglomerates have pushed the prestige and credibil-
ity of news programs aside for the ratings of opinion 
programs.
There is a place for opinion, for speculation, but it’s 
typically labeled as such. There is also a place for biting 
investigative journalism that uncovers the hypocrisy 
and shady dealings of our world, something that seems to be in small supply today. Something that Stewart and Co. capitalized on last week, as the ratings of “Mad Money” plummeted and “The Daily Show” soared. 
And I didn’t need a thesaurus to figure that one out.Matthew Christ is a political science freshman. His col-
umn appears on Mondays.Welcome back for the home stretch of the spring semes-
ter — a mere five weeks remain until the endless pos-sibilities of summer embrace you with open arms.
Whether you were avoiding Mexican drug cartels like the 
plague or sneaking into private 40th-birthday parties held in 
honor of B-list celebrities, we can safely assume that you caught 
up on some much-overdue partying. Now that you are back, we hope you are ready to attack the remainder of the semester with the fervor of a Santa Monica street performer preying on the wallets of unsuspecting tourists donning the latest offerings in fanny pack fashion.
But if you’re like us, you might find yourself wary of letting 
the party end — even if your bank account took a bigger hit than a right hook to the jugular from Rampage Jackson.
Ah, the great dilemma of achieving balance; it befuddles 
even the craftiest members of The Gator Nation. We are only kidding ourselves if the goal for the remainder of the semes-ter fails to include concocting a seven-step handshake with that I-heard-he-can-bench-press-the-world bouncer manning the door at the Grog House — along with a 3.5 GPA.
Slap, clap, fist pound, shimmy, crazy fingers, chest bump, 
high five!
With your grades in mind and your social lives our foremost 
concern, the Editorial Board bestows upon you three gems of wisdom to help you live out the tagline from “Entourage” in your everyday life. Like Vince, Ari and the boys, maybe you, too, can have it all.
You probably caught yourself wondering why on your re-
turn flight home you were a beef torta or two away from having to sheepishly ask the flight attendant for a seat belt extension. Sure, you were never going to confuse anyone for McDreamy, but trust us when we say the Spring Break Diet and South Beach 
Diet are not two distant cousins.
Now that you’re back in Gainesville, say goodbye to filet mi-
gnon and Fiji artesian water, and learn to make fast friends with 
the dumpster behind Leo’s. We hear if you time it just right, you might even be able to score some marinara sauce to keep your oh-so-fresh half-eaten rolls company.
While nothing can replace getting your groove on at a club 
in Acapulco with some nameless coed as the beer flows like wine, who says you can’t recreate the same magic right here in 
Gainesville? Everyone knows that the prime-time nights to pe-
ruse the social offerings of our fine city fall within the trifecta of Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights — but let’s think outside the box for a minute.
Generally recognized as a time to get work done and conjure 
imagery of another lost weekend, Monday evenings are this season’s new black. Head down to Common Grounds for a few rounds of free PBR, and keep the party going while you channel your inner Meat Loaf, telling the world that you will, in fact, do 
anything for love.
Didn’t do the reading for econ and you want to pretend that 
you are an active contributor to your class discussion? Say it 
slowly with us now, folks: T-A-N-G-E-N-T — God’s gift to un-derachieving students everywhere.
Even if you haven’t been blessed with the gift of gab, posing 
questions to the class vaguely related to the topic at hand can quickly have your professor thinking you are the next “Good Will Hunting.” Nothing beats racking up the participation points effort-free while your classmates sneer at you after giv-ing up their Tuesday night to pore over hours of listless jargon.
What are you waiting for? Hit the streets hard and the books 
not so much, fellow demigod.
But if you’re not up for the challenge, just take solace in the 
fact that debauchery will soon rear its ugly head once again.
Only 51 more weeks until Spring Break 2010.

UF e-mail fails to deliver
I do not understand how 
UF has an extraordinary main 
Web site, but our e-mail service 
is nothing short of rubbish. 
There have been innumer-
able times that I have tried to 
go to my e-mail and could not 
access it. 
Sometimes I need to open 
an attachment for a class, but 
WebMail is not working — what a surprise. 
I ask for the talented men 
and women working in com-
puting services and people in 
the Student Government on campus to address this issue, to 
learn from the masters: Gmail, 
Hotmail. 
Thousands depend on this 
vital service to our education that seems to be ignored. 
Ahmed Jorge
4EGLetters to the Editor
Column
There have been a ton of hard-hitting 
items in the news lately: President Ba-rack Obama has pushed forward stem-
cell research, the chairman of the Republican National Committee announced that he’s pro-
choice and Jon Stewart nearly made Jim Cra-
mer wet his pants. That’s all well and good, but I want to talk about something that’s re-ally been on my mind. Sunday, Comedy Cen-tral roasted Daniel Lawrence Whitney — bet-ter known as Larry the Cable Guy — and I shed a tear for comedy.
I was OK when they decided to roast Jeff 
Foxworthy. I don’t like his stuff but there’s 
no denying that — more than being popular 
— he made a contribution to the medium of comedy by opening the door for all this hor-rible redneck stuff that’s out there now a la the “Blue Collar Comedy Tour.” I’m not hap-py about his impact, but the fact remains that he’s had one. Larry the Cable Guy, however, has done nothing except march across the country with his admittedly fake accent (look 
for clips of Whitney on you tube before he 
invented Larry — he can actually speak Eng-lish — and shout “git-r-done.” Well, that’s not entirely fair. He unleashed some unforgivable movies on the public, as well. And his lowest-common-denominator brand of comedy has been devoured by the legions of the un-washed.
Let me make one 
thing perfectly clear: 
This is no good-na-
tured ribbing. This is not a continuation of his roast. This is an exhortation for Whitney to retire 
permanently from the comedic arts and take his alter ego back behind the shed and shoot it — if I had my way, he would have to pay 
some form of reparations as well.
But really, I don’t think this terrible, 
nonredneck comedian is the problem. I think 
he’s a symptom of what’s really at the core of all this: the glorification of his brand of lowest-common-denominator comedy. Two examples besides Whitney stick out in my mind, and they are Carlos Mencia (given name: Ned) and Dane Cook. If I have to listen 
to Mencia call someone “dee-dee-dee” one 
more time, I’m going to cry. Cook, the dar-ling of superfans everywhere, is even worse. Most of the time he doesn’t even tell a joke — no, jumping around as you illuminate one extended, digression-ridden anecdote doesn’t count. Occasionally, he’ll include a punch line, but here’s a news flash: Cook steals his jokes. He doesn’t “borrow,” he doesn’t “im-prove upon,” he just steals. Get over it.
Stand-up comedy is one of my favorite 
things. I fell in love with it at a young age when I first saw a “Comedy Central Pres-ents” special for Kathleen Madigan. A whole world of brilliant, ironic, thought-provoking, subversive and, most importantly, hilarious ideas was opened to me. When I see the likes of Cook, Mencia and Whitney selling out shows, I just know that Bill Hicks and George Carlin are turning over in their graves.
I would like to hope that the popularity of 
these hacks — and that’s just what they are — simply comes from a lack of known alterna-tives. Luckily, there are many. Patton Oswalt, Eugene Mirman and Louis C.K. are all still performing. Give them a chance. They’re the future of the comedy tradition the way Car-lin, Hicks, Pryor and Rickles were the past.
I want to take this opportunity to ask 
Comedy Central to stop selling its soul in a Faustian bargain to popular hackdom. It hurts all of us. That’s the important thing for the week.

UP NEXT ONLINE POLL QUESTIONBy MIKE DiFERDINANDO
Alligator Staff Writer
mdiferdinando@alligator.org
For the second straight season, 
the Gators failed to make the NCAA 
Tournament.
UF (23-10, 9-7 Southeastern Con-
ference) did make history, though, 
becoming the first team since Michi-
gan State in 1980 to be left out of the field for two consecutive years after winning a national title.
Any hopes the Gators had of 
making it to the Big Dance were dashed after Friday’s 61-58 loss to Auburn in the quarterfinals of the SEC Tournament.
UF had an RPI of 51, the 86th-
best strength of schedule, one win against a top-50 RPI team (Pacific-10 Conference regular-season cham-pion Washington) and a 2-6 road 
record in conference games.
“We obviously didn’t do 
enough,” forward Dan Werner said 
following the loss to Auburn. “We could have put ourselves in if we 
would have won (the SEC) tourna-ment.”
UF coach Billy Donovan said all 
season that being a year older didn’t 
necessarily make his team a year better.
It turns out he was right.
UF suffered another late-season 
collapse, losing seven of its last 12 
games, and missed several opportu-nities to lock up an NCAA bid.
The Gators lost eight of their last 
11 games last season.
UF has accepted a bid to play 
in the National Invitation Tourna-ment and will host  Jacksonville on 
Wednesday in the opening round at 
8 p.m.
If they win, the Gators will face 
the winner of No. 4-seed Miami and No. 5-seed Providence.
The Gators are the No. 1 seed in 
their region and will host the first 
two rounds of the tournament.
UF is also the first school ever 
to follow up back-to-back national 
championships with back-to-back 
NIT appearances.UF MEN’S BASKETBALL

Arkansas pitcher Jarrod McKinney isn’t on the soccer team, 
but he showed some kicking ability Sunday.
With the game tied at 2 in the bottom of the eighth and a 
runner on third, McKinney struck out on a pitch in the dirt 
from Patrick Keating (2-3, 3.57 ERA). 
On his way to first, he booted the ball away from UF catcher 
Buddy Munroe, allowing Ben Tschepikow to score from third, carrying the No. 18 Razorbacks to a 4-2 win and completing the sweep of the Gators (9-7, 0-3 Southeastern Conference) in Fayetteville, Ark.
Arguments from Munroe, Keating and UF coach Kevin 
O’Sullivan — who was ejected for arguing — proved futile. Home-plate umpire Joe Marion was unwilling to listen to any complaints about McKinney’s kicking and did not request help from the other umpires.
“All he had to do was ask for some help, and he may have gotten the call right,” UF assistant coach Brad Weitzel said. “But the runner that scored we walked to lead off the inning, so we got to go back to that point first instead of blaming it on the umpire.”
The Gators got an outstanding start from freshman lefty 
Nick Maronde, who struck out five and allowed just 1 earned 
run over five innings.
But the team could not give Maronde much run support or 
defensive help.
The defense committed six errors, including two each by 
third baseman Mike Mooney and Munroe, who didn’t enter 
the game until the eighth.No. 18 Arkansas completes weekend sweep of UF

The room reeked of heartbreak.
As you might imagine, the St. 
Pete Times Forum locker room that 
housed the UF men’s basketball team fresh 
off its crushing 61-58 defeat at the hands of 
Auburn on Friday night was not very wel-
coming.
It felt like a child asking his parents why 
they were splitting up.
There are many small reasons — a last-
second loss to Auburn being the final straw — but it is never as simple as one of these.There is always a 
bigger picture.
The snapshot of 
the Gators locker room looked some-thing like this:  
On your left sits 
Walter Hodge, the se-nior who just watched his last shot at getting 
back to the NCAA Tournament fail. Next to him is Nick Calathes, the Gators’ best player, who flamed out down the stretch. Panning to the right brings Dan Werner and Alex Tyus into focus, two “big” men who each played out of position yet gave their all. Then finally, directly to your right, is the inconsolable man, Erving Walker.
Hodge may feel like he failed this team 
and his coach. The lone holdover from the back-to-back national championship teams, he was the veteran who linked those glory years with the rebuilding ones.
But the man who has won more than 
anyone else in UF men’s basketball history couldn’t turn his teammates into similar winners.
The Gators lost 10 games this season, 
and only one of those was by double dig-its (79-63 at Tennessee on Jan. 31). Eight of them were decided by 6 points or fewer.
“They need to learn how to win,” coach 
Billy Donovan said of his team. “Just be-cause you’re a year older doesn’t mean you’re a year better.”
As soon as Calathes confidently stated 
he thought his team would make the Tour-

� THE SOPHOMORE BROKE THE UF 
RECORD IN THE 60-METER DASH.
By TONI-ANN MILLER
Alligator Writer
Lately for Terrell Wilks, another week 
means another school record. 
After notching an automatic-qualifying 
time in the Virginia Tech Qualifier on March 
7, Wilks continued his record-breaking per-formances in last weekend’s NCAA Indoor Championships in College Station, Texas.
Wilks ran a 6.59 in the preliminaries of the 
60-meter dash and finished third in the finals of the event.
Wilks’ school-record-setting performance 
in Texas helped UF’s men to their best NCAA Indoors finish since 2005.
UF’s men finished as runners-up with 
36 points behind NCAA-champion Oregon, 
which had 54 points. The women’s team fin-
ished the Indoor Championships tied for 12th place.
Wilks’ 60-meter time was his new personal 
best and UF’s new record for the event.
“While we are pleased with being second 
in the country, we are not satisfied,” UF coach Mike Holloway said. “There’s still work to do, and we still have the ability to get better. But 
we are very pleased with what’s going on, and everybody is excited about getting outdoors 
and trying to get better.”
Despite coming up one place short, UF’s 
track and field program is moving in a posi-
tive direction, much to Hollo-way’s pleasure. 
“I don’t think there’s any-
body in the program that wanted to be second, but sec-ond’s better than third, and a lot of teams are aspiring to be second, so the program is 
definitely moving in the right direction,” Hol-loway said.
Wilks’ recent performances are a direct 
result of his hard work and may come as a surprise to some because of his late start in the sport. 
He was a football and basketball player 
before adding track to his resume as a high school senior.
Subsequently, Wilks has had to put in extra 
work to hone his track skills.
“He’s still learning the intricacies of run-
ning the sprints, and as he learns more, he catches on to things. He’s just gonna get better and better,” Holloway said. “What people are seeing in the last couple weeks is just Terrell starting to really understand what it takes to be a good sprinter, and he now has the three fastest times ever run by a Gator in the 60, so 
we’re pretty excited about that.” Wilks leads UF men to second place in NCAA Indoors

Before last season, Donovan had not 
coached in the NIT since 1998.
“We’re grateful for the opportunity to con-
tinue our season at the NIT,” Donovan said 
in a statement. “We’re looking forward to the opportunity to continue to practice and grow as a team.”
UF made it to Madison Square Garden and 
the NIT semifinals in New York last season be-fore losing to Massachusetts.
The NCAA selection committee was not 
kind to the SEC this year. Only three teams from the conference made the tournament, the fewest since 1990.
Tennessee, a No. 9 seed, will face No. 8 seed Oklahoma State. LSU, a No. 8 seed, will face No. 9-seed Butler. Mississippi State, which earned an automatic bid by winning the SEC Tournament on Sunday afternoon against 
Tennessee, earned a No. 13 seed and will face 
No. 4-seed Washington.
Auburn looked like it might have played 
its way into the field after winning nine of its 
last 11 games and knocking off UF in the con-ference tournament. But the Tigers failed to land a spot in the Big Dance as well.
In a teleconference earlier this month, SEC 
Commissioner Mike Slive said he didn’t think 
a conference’s RPI would be a determining 
factor when deciding which schools would 
receive at-large bids, but the SEC ranks sixth overall in Conference RPI and last among the major conferences.Southeastern Conference nets just three bids in NCAA Tournament
“Maronde pitched out of some jams and pitched through 
some poor defense,” Weitzel said. “This is a beautiful field. 
There is no way you can make six errors on a beautiful field like this.”
Maronde’s quality outing was the first UF got from a starter 
this weekend.
Billy Bullock (0-1, 1.84 ERA) made his first start of the sea-son Friday and lasted only 3 1/3 innings before being yanked. He gave up 6 runs, including 4 unearned because of an error 
he made on a suicide squeeze attempt, and the Gators dropped the opening game 11-4.
Saturday’s starter, Alex Panteliodis (2-2, 
6.50 ERA), couldn’t even make it out of the second inning before being relieved because of the 5 runs he allowed in the Gators’ 8-4 loss.
UF’s bats couldn’t get much going, either. 
Entering Sunday’s game, the Gators were near the bottom of every offensive category in the SEC.
Outfielders Avery Barnes and Riley Cooper were the only 
UF players to record at least one hit in each game this week-end. 
They provided the Gators with a little bit of power, each 
smacking a solo home run in the series — Cooper on Friday and Barnes on Sunday.
After a great opening weekend against then-No. 23 Louis-
ville, UF has now dropped six straight against ranked oppo-nents — Miami is currently No. 13 and Arkansas is No. 18.Maronde’s pitching performance lone bright spot for Gators in series
nament, his play sank.
He scored 34 points combined 
in UF’s final four games. He had 
previously racked up 33 points at 
Kentucky on Feb. 10.
Give him credit for not making 
any excuses. Teams started guard-ing UF differently on the pick-and-roll, Calathes’ bread and but-ter, and fatigue likely set in for the starter who played 33 minutes.
It’s hard to criticize a generally 
amicable guy, but you can’t avoid 
pointing out that Calathes let his 
team down. That is the power of guarantees: You’re a hero if you live up to them, but you must face the music if you don’t.
“The thing you love about him 
is Nick is such a competitor,” Donovan said. “He wants to take all that on, and I’d rather have a guy like that.”
Then again, it may have been 
Calathes’ own will that effectively 
stopped him.
Fierce competitors hate to lose. 
When they fall behind or perform 
poorly, they push themselves harder in an attempt to will the outcome in their favor.
There is a downside to this, 
though, and his recent slump shows you can’t always “try” your way out of a hole.
“Sometimes guys go in to a 
game with their mind made up 
of how they’re going to play, and 
what they’re going to try to do instead of allowing the game to come to themselves,” Donovan said. “Nick’s got to allow it to come a little bit more.”
So now the Gators enter the 
NIT. They may go far, or they might face an early exit.While UF tries to find its con-
sistent, winning ways again, there may be more sights like Friday 
night in the future.
Hodge, the proven winner, 
comforting Walker, the clutch 
freshman whose potential game-tying shot had just fallen short.
I imagine he might say what a 
soon-to-be divor cee might:

 Stacey Nelson has seemingly done 
it all in her four years at UF. Sunday, 
she accomplished something even she 
previously thought impossible.
Nelson threw her ﬁ  rst career no-
hitter in No. 1 UF’s 4-0 win at Missis-
sippi on Sunday. The senior pitched 
two complete-game shutouts and led the Gators (27-2, 8-0 Southeastern Conference) to a weekend sweep of the Rebels (11-12, 0-6 SEC) in Oxford, 
Miss.
Despite a pitcher’s usual practice of 
not focusing on or talking about a po-
tential no-hitter, Nelson admitted her 
mind kept wandering back to the idea 
of her ﬁ  rst career no-hitter.
“I didn’t believe it until that last 
out,” she said. “I always had a joke that no-hitters just weren’t my thing.”
Nelson (14-2, 0.40 ERA) also made 
her way into the NCAA record books by improving her career record to 109-33, tied for 25th on the NCAA all-time 
wins list with Jennie Finch, who won 
109 games for Arizona. 
Ali Gardiner hit an RBI double to 
center in the ﬁ  rst inning to start the scoring for the Gators on Sunday. 
Shortstop Megan Bush added to the 
lead in the fourth with her seventh home run of the season. Later that inning, second baseman Aja Paculba knocked in the ﬁ  nal run of the game with a double down the left-ﬁ  eld line.
Nelson’s ﬁ  rst victory of the week-
end came in the Gators’ 2-0 win in Game 1 of their doubleheader Satur-day. UF’s ace gave up ﬁ  ve hits and 
struck out 10.
Nelson traded zeros with Missis-
sippi pitcher Becky Nye until the sixth 
inning, when Gardiner launched a 
solo home run over 
the scoreboard in right-center ﬁ  eld for the ﬁ  rst run of the game. 
“Hitting is conta-
gious, so once you get one hit, the next few will come and 
open up the game,” Gardiner said. 
“It changed the momentum for 
sure.”
Nelson struck out the side in the 
bottom of the sixth, and Aja Paculba 
added an insurance run with a single 
up the middle that drove in Michelle Moultrie in the seventh inning.
The Gators took that late-game mo-
mentum at the plate into Game 2 and 
put 12 runs on the board. 
Sophomore Stephanie Brombacher 
(13-0, 0.79 ERA) followed up Nelson’s 
performance with a shutout of her own and allowed only four hits while striking out seven batters. UF SOFTBALLNelson throws no-hitter

 The Gators won’t be sweating it out 
tonight.
On this Selection Monday, the UF 
women’s basketball team will not be wor-
ried about bubble talk and being left out of March Madness like it was last season.
The No. 21 Gators (23-7, 9-5 Southeast-
ern Conference) are a lock to make this year’s NCAA Tournament.
So when the brackets are revealed 
tonight at 7 on ESPN, UF will be more concerned about who, when and where it will be playing in the ﬁ  rst round later this week.
The Gators, once projected as high as a 
No. 3 seed by ESPN.com’s Charlie Creme, have lost some ground over the last four weeks.
Creme has them as a No. 7 seed in his 
latest version of Bracketology, his daily predictions of the ﬁ  eld of 64.
UF fell a few spots when they dropped 
ﬁ  ve of their last six games, including a quarterﬁ  nal loss to the Tennessee in the SEC Tournament on March 6.
Though UF appears to be slumping 
at the worst possible time, it showed glimpses of its early season brilliance in 
the second half against Tennessee.
After trailing by 17 at the break, the Gators rallied to within 3 points with less 
than three minutes remaining.
Despite winning the second half 46-
33, the Gators eventually fell 71-67 to the Volunteers.
UF coach Amanda Butler, however, 
was proud of her team’s second-half ef-fort.
“If that Florida team shows up (in the 
NCAA Tournament), then we’re not just in position to beat a great team like Ten-
nessee, but we whipped them in the second half,” Butler said. 
“We whipped them 
in the second half like they whipped us in the ﬁ  rst half.”
Butler added that 
even though the Gators came up short in their conference tournament, she saw the trouble her team could cause in the NCAA Tournament if it plays an entire game the way it did in the second half against the Volunteers.
“As disappointing as this is to be leav-
ing here with a loss right now, I also think that there’s a lot to build on going into the postseason,” Butler said after the loss.
If the Gators get the No. 7 seed as 
Creme projects, they will face a No. 10 seed in the ﬁ  rst round and would have a potential second-round matchup with a No. 2 seed. Women await tourney bid
