Student outdoor enthusiasts will have to adjust to more 
than just the dip in temperatures this semester.
UF’s Travel and Recreation Program, known as TRiP, 
has made the transition from a student-run organization 
to an employing program for the ﬁ  rst time. 
TRiP plans and takes students on outdoor leisure and 
adventure excursions.
Program coordinator Jackie Matthews said the changes 
will make trips cheaper for students, create more lead-ership and professional development opportunities for members.
The organization will also begin to pay trip leaders and 
other staff. 
“I’m extremely excited about it,” Matthews said. The group was generating almost all of its own fund-
ing before the changes were made, but it is now ﬁ  nan-cially supported by the Department of Student Activities and Involvement, she said.
The structural changes go into effect this semester, she 
said. The organization is  reviewing applications for new leaders for the spring.
Previously, TRiP members would meet and vote on 
trips and the running of the organization itself. Although TRiP funding increases, lowers costs for students

Sisler Hall will remain closed today after a 
chemical explosion Wednesday afternoon, UF 
ofﬁ  cials said.
On Thursday , UF’s Environmental Health 
and Safety department investigated the explo-sion that seriously injured graduate student Khanh Ha. Ha was working under a protective hood on the second ﬂ  oor when the incident happened.
Sisler Hall does not have any classrooms, 
UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes said. It houses research labs, ofﬁ  ces and stock rooms.
Ha, 27, is in stable condition at Shands at 
UF.
Sikes said no other buildings were closed 
Wednesday night, but some professors’ ofﬁ  ces are in Sisler Hall, and those classes might have been canceled. 
Brittany Garner, a 19-year-old psychology 
sophomore, said her General Chemistry class in the Chemistry Lab building was called off.
Also, a seminar was canceled because it was 
supposed to consist of graduate students who are “based” in Sisler Hall, Sikes said.
According to Gainesville Fire Rescue, one 
of the known agents involved in the research is sodium azide, a chemical found in some rocket propellants and car air bags.
The Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention identiﬁ  es sodium azide as a potentially deadly chemical that, when involved in an ex-plosion, can cause burns and expose people to toxic gas.
A similar explosion occurred in Sisler Hall 
on Oct. 11 when a student was transferring a vial of a shock-sensitive chemical compound to a scale.Grad student stable after

Scooter sales in Gainesville 
continue to rise, despite the 
price increase for scooter and motorcycle decals at UF last semester.
Since August, students 
have paid $144 a year and $72 a semester for the decals, the same amount they pay for car decals. In the 2010-11 school year, the decals cost $96 a year and $48 a semester.
However, the store own-
ers at New Scooters 4 Less and SwampCycles both said scooter sales are going up.
At Solano Cycle, Man-
ager A.J. Wallace said more students are buying scoot-ers because they are cheaper, they use gas more efﬁ  ciently and they are easier to park on campus than cars.
Ben Stein, a 20-year-old 
political science sophomore, said he enjoys being able to park his scooter next to Li-brary West and walk to class.
“For the money you pay 
for it,” he said, “it’s way worth it.”
Scooter and motorcycle de-
cal sales at UF were also unaf-fected by the price increase.
Ron Fuller, assistant di-
rector of UF Transportation and Parking Services, said the number of students who bought yearlong scooter or motorcycle decals between Sept. 1 and Dec. 31 increased from 1,969 in 2010 to 1,990 in 2011.
Fuller said he thinks the 
decal sales keep rising be-cause students still want the conveniently located spots re-served for smaller vehicles.
Bernard Johnson, a 22-
year-old Spanish senior, said last semester’s price increase was a ﬁ  nancial struggle for him.
“If you’re going to change 
[the price] for one vehicle then you should change it for the others as well,” he said.
Fuller said scooter and mo-
torcycle decals originally cost less than car decals because parking services wanted to encourage students to use the smaller, more sustainable ve-hicles.
However, a 2006 survey of 
students who bought the de-cals found that most students would walk, bike or ride bus-es if they didn’t ride scooters. Students who ride scooters to campus tend to make eight to 10 trips a day, whereas car drivers park and then walk or ride buses around campus.
Driving a car to campus is 
actually more sustainable than riding a scooter from class to class, Fuller said, so the de-partment decided to make the decal prices the same.
After compromising with 
Student Government, the price increase was phased in throughout the last three years.

� IT USED TO COST $4 TO PARK IN 
THE GARAGES.

Parking for hospital visits will now like-
ly involve less hassle.
UF&Shands began providing free park-
ing to patients, family members and visi-
tors Monday.
About 2,000 people a day park at 
UF&Shands, said David Guzick, senior vice president for health affairs and presi-dent of the UF&Shands Health System.
Parking fees were used to cover the $1.5 
million to $2 million needed to maintain the garage, but now those costs will be paid by UF faculty medical practices and the Shands at UF medical center, he said.
“We like to think it is Gators giving back 
to Gators,” he said. 
UF&Shands has three garages and two 
parking lots for patients and visitors. It used to cost $4 to park in the garages and $6 for valet parking, he said.
“A lack of parking is an impediment, 
and we wanted to get rid of that impedi-ment,” Guzick said.
Molly Williams, a 22-year-old food sci-
ence and human nutrition senior, said she paid the $4-charge every time she visited her friend, who is undergoing chemother-apy treatment at Shands at UF.
“I think it will make it a lot easier on 
the parents to come and go as they please,” she said.Shands to

Communion wine may not be the only alcohol 
near downtown churches if a city ordinance gets 
altered.
The City Plan Board passed a petition to 
change an ordinance that forbid bars to set up shop within 300 feet of a church or other religious establishment anywhere within city limits.
If changed, the ordinance will get rid of the 
distance requirement between bars and places of religious assembly only within the central city district and the tourist-oriented district, said Bob Woods, city spokesman.
The central city district is an area of down-
town bordered by Northwest and Southwest Sixth Streets and Northeast and Southeast Third Streets.
It encompasses Bo Diddley Community Plaza, 
the Hippodrome State Theatre and multiple res-taurants and bars. The tourist-oriented district re-fers to a small area on Southwest 13th Street near Williston Road.
The idea to exclude downtown Gainesville 
from the rule was offered after downtown busi-ness owners told city staff they were concerned with the current ordinance, according to a docu-ment written by the staff.
If the current ordinance does not change, new 
bars will still be required to set up at least 300 feet away from a religious establishment, according to a city document about the change.
“I’m not going to say I’d love to have a bar right 
next to us, but we haven’t had a problem with any of them in the past,” said the Rev. Louanne Loch, rector at Holy Trinity Episcopal Church. 
The church, located at 100 NE First St., is across 
the street from the downtown plaza and next to City Hall. 
Loch said she understands downtown is a 
community of businesses that need to help one another out. 
“As long as it doesn’t cause lewd behavior 
around the church, I am ﬁ  ne with it,” she said. “But if these problems arise, then we will have to address them.”Bars may get leeway near churches
� ABOUT 300 WOMEN ARE 
EXPECTED TO SIGN UP.

UF sororities are expecting about 
300 students to sign up for spring 
recruitment, up from about 200 last year.
Recruitment, also known as rush, 
starts Sunday for Interfraternity Council fraternities and Panhellenic Council sororities, said Carey Mays,  program coordinator for the Ofﬁ  ce of Sorority and Fraternity Affairs. 
Mays said although fraternities 
see an average of 250 students rush each spring, the number has been steadily rising for sororities.
He said about 80 students went 
through sorority rush in 2009 and about 120 did so in 2010.Both sororities and fraternities 
see higher numbers in the fall, Mays said. 
UF Panhellenic Council Presi-
dent Cari Swertfager said about 1,100 students went through soror-ity rush in the fall.
She attributed the jump in spring 
numbers to an increase in market-ing with ﬂ  iers and informational sessions.
She said about 11 of the 16 Pan-
hellenic sororities are participating in spring rush. 
All of the fraternities are partici-
pating, Mays said.
National Pan-Hellenic Council 
and Multicultural Greek Council so-rorities and fraternities usually con-duct rush independently, he said.
A sorority rush informational 
meeting will be held at 6 p.m. Sun-day in the Reitz Union Grand Ball-room.Sorority and fraternity 
spring rush begins Sunday
“I’m not going to say I’d love to have a 
bar right next to us, but we haven’t had

the Rev. Louanne Loch
rector at Holy Trinity Episcopal Churchwill be used to pay the artist.
The University Box Office will sell 
2,500 discounted tickets to students at 
three prices levels. Five hundred tickets will be available for $32, 1,000 for $53 and 1,000 for $74.
The general public can purchase 
tickets starting at 10 a.m. online at Tick-etmaster.com for $45 to $87, and addi-tional surcharges may apply, Musson said.
Drake, 25, was born Aubrey Drake 
Graham and grew up in Toronto, Can-ada, according to Drake’s MySpace page.  He rose to fame playing Jimmy Brooks on the TV show “Degrassi: The Next Generation.”
His first studio album, “Thank Me 
Later,” debuted at No. 1 on the Bill-board 200 and later went platinum. In November, he released his second stu-dio album, “Take Care,” featuring col-laborations with other artists, including Rihanna, Lil Wayne and Nicki Minaj.
Any student with a college ID can 
buy a discounted ticket at the box of-fice. Only one ID per person will be ac-cepted, Musson said, but each student can buy up to two discounted tickets and up to eight tickets total. The box of-fice will only accept cash.
Musson said the capacity for the 
event is between 7,000 and 9,000 peo-ple. No general admission is available, she said, only assigned seating.
Elsa Moto, a 20-year-old criminol-
ogy and psychology sophomore, said the tickets were too expensive for her.

that much.” FRIDAY, JANUARY 13, 2012 § ALLIGATOR, 5

it was ideally democratic, this style proved difficult, Mat-
thews said.
“It lacked a lot of structure that could have really pro-
vided a good foundation for them to move forward,” Mat-thews said. “It was eventually just going to crumble on itself.”
Now, Matthews has a group of five managers under her who will help plan trips and work with the lead guides, assistant leaders and leaders-in-training.
Many of the members were surprised and concerned 
when Matthews announced the changes midway through the fall, said TRiP member and geomatics junior Taylor Henninge.
“We have a culture in this program,“ Henninge said, 
“and I think a lot of people were just scared of losing that culture.”He and fellow member Kirsten Montanari, a geogra-
phy and anthropology senior, said although they were nervous about the changes at first, the soul of the organi-zation is still the same.
However, Montanari said she remains lukewarm to-
ward her new paycheck. 
“I don’t think anybody cares about that at all,” she 
said. “I can tell you positively that no one wanted to ever get paid for this.” Trip , from page 1Reader response

Earlier this week, one of our editorials addressed the 
insane occupational licensing laws that exist on the state of Florida’s books. One such law required that anyone who practices interior design in Florida be licensed. The edito-rial claimed that all interior designers needed to obtain a license. 
However, after many complaints from readers, we dis-
covered that the licensing law only applies to commercial interior designers, not to people who do such consulting in residential areas. 
For this error, I, Justin Hayes, the opinions editor of the 
Alligator, will be throwing a the-fact-was-wrong-but-the-point-still-stands DART at myself. 
The argument we made about this issue still stands. 
Owners of commercial buildings should not have to get permission from the state to pay someone for consulting on interior design. 
Most commercial building owners will probably go with 
someone with qualifications, but if they choose not to, it’s none of the government’s business.
As evidence that occupational licensing does little, if 
anything, to help the interior design industry, when the Institute for Justice compared states that regulated inte-rior designers to states that had little to no regulation, they found that “more complaints were present in conditions of greater regulation” of the field. 
Now, onto the good news. For a move that many procrastinators should appreci-
ate, we give an if-only-Starbucks-stayed-open-24-hours-too LAUREL to Library West, which will now remain open 24 
hours Sunday through Thursday. More studying is worth the increase in caffeine addiction. 
In another cause for celebration, we give a now-might-
be-a-good-time-to-become-a-taxi-driver LAUREL to the 
City of Gainesville, who changed its alcohol laws at the end of last semester. 
Because of these changes, liquor stores and bars are 
changing their Sunday hours so Sunday Funday will last a little longer. 
Looks like someone remembered that whole Establish-
ment Clause thing. 
That’s all that we have for you this week. For next 
week’s edition, we should return to our normal dose of dart-throwing and laurel-giving.
In the meantime, have a fun and safe weekend, and be 
sure to check back next week. Americans need to question government 
When Americans think of organized crime, we tend 
to think of drive-by shootings, drug rings or guys with bats who intimidate business owners. We 
may recall infamous gangsters from history classes, but the finger ought to be pointed in a new direction: toward the U.S. government. 
Behind the guise of helping people, spreading democ-
racy and promoting egalitarianism, the U.S. government is the largest organized crime ring in the world. The irony is that the government has helped paint the pictures in your mind of organized crime, obfuscating its own crookedness. 
The people who run the government are swindlers. Poli-
ticians take bribes in the form of campaign contributions and once in office, they sprinkle feed around so their sup-porters will return during the next election cycle. This feed comes in the forms of handouts, tax breaks, subsidies, wel-fare and warfare. They are easily bought and sold by the biggest bidders. 
Their positions change with the winds of fortune. Con-
gress passes legislation that benefits itself. It is a shame that professional politicians have replaced statesmen.
Our checkbooks seem to be partly owned by the gang-
sters in Washington; the government certainly excises its pound of flesh every Tax Day. If you don’t give into its whims “voluntarily,” the government forcibly seizes your money. We even get “protection” in return, just the same as if we were paying a mobster. 
The gangsters also try to influence our moral compasses 
with their rules regarding drugs, gambling, prostitution and marriage. These rules are part of the so-called protection.
The U.S. government not only pushes its own people 
around, but it bullies other organized crime governments. Washington clearly believes it has the right to decide who can pursue nuclear weapons. 
America stations its muscle in hundreds of military bases 
around the world and postures it in ways that deter the oth-er gangs. The U.S. intervenes when two other gangs have a dispute over territory. Washing-ton bribes other countries in the form of “foreign aid” because it is easier to gain influence by throw-ing money than it is to promote diplomacy between nations. 
America spends about as 
much money on the military as the rest of the world combined to have the biggest stick to wave 
around. Although pouring money into a military does not always necessitate its foolish misuse, the past decade’s for -
eign policy blunders have proven that America’s gangsters cannot walk softly and carry a big stick.  Washington rou-tinely carries out hits on other leaders, sometimes directly and other times covertly. When Washington doesn’t get its way through means of pressuring, it will start a war, sometimes for no beneficial reason other than to prove its military might. These wars take wrecking balls to buildings built through the sweat and toil of others, and these wars tear apart families, leaving relatives with tears and pictures of the deceased.
The point of this extended metaphor is not to besmirch 
government (it has achieved this by itself), but to serve as a wake-up call. There is a swirling mass of nonsensical traves-ties committed by the U.S. government. Americans are the problem because we are enablers. We are sheep waiting for shepherds, and the current shepherd has certainly pulled the wool over our eyes. 
We ought to question the wisdom and authority of the 
government in every affair to prevent gangsterism. The people have a government, not the other way around, and our contract is the Constitution. The dilemma is that the government has repeatedly broken the contract. I favor a more politically aware citizenry and fewer sheep.

On Dec. 10, 2011, Lowe’s Companies, Inc.  decided 
to pull its advertisements from TLC’s “All-Amer -
ican Muslim.” This show is an eight-part reality 
TV series that follows the lives of five American Muslim families in the Detroit suburb of Dearborn, Mich. 
Lowe’s decided to pull its advertisement from the 
show due to criticisms from the conservative Christian group, Florida Family Association. FFA claims “TLC’s ‘All-American Muslim’ is propaganda clearly designed to counter legitimate and present-day concerns about many Muslims who are advancing Islamic fundamentalism and Sharia law,” and it “profiles only Muslims that appear to be ordinary folks while excluding many Islamic believers whose agenda poses a clear and present danger to liber -
ties and traditional values that the majority of Americans cherish.” They also claim that the show “is attempting to manipulate Americans into ignoring the threat of jihad and to influence them to believe that being concerned about the jihad threat would somehow victimize these nice people in this show.” Some members go even as far as 
claiming — via various interviews and statements on major TV net-works — that they were offended 
because the show failed to depict extremist Muslims.
It is true that Lowe’s certainly cannot be held respon-
sible for these very ignorant and bigoted views, but its de-cision to agree with these views by removing advertising from the show is incredibly hurtful. How can citizens of the U.S. fight hatred and bigotry if it only takes one or two letters from a fringe group to cause such a big decision from a major company. Islamophobia creates tension and makes people assume that all Muslims are terrorists. 
In reality, Islam is a peaceful religion. Yes, it is unfor -
tunate that there are those who will take the words and teachings of Islam out of context or radicalize it for their own agenda. That is why it is the duty of those who are educated to share with those who don’t know the true meaning of all religions from Christianity to Islam to Hin-duism. Still, there is no excuse when those with closed minds 
try to manipulate society and large corporations into ad-vocating their closed-minded views. The actions of the Inquisition do not represent Christianity, a very peaceful and loving religion. Likewise, terrorism does not repre-sent Islam. It is the duty of society and its people to unite in promoting good and forbidding evil to ensure a peace-ful and promising future.
Although Lowe’s claims that it is refraining from the 
public debate, its decision to pull advertising from “All-American Muslim” is making a clear statement.
Lowe’s decision to pull its advertising was very offen-
sive and ignorant. How can we begin to combat outdated and marginalized views of American Muslims when a gi-ant retailer like Lowe’s does not have the decency to stand up to racist views? 
I am calling on Lowe’s to publicly apologize for its 
decision to pull advertising from TLC’s “All-American Muslim.”

UF President Bernie Machen will join the 
Florida House of Representatives’ education 
committee today in Tallahassee to discuss is-sues affecting Florida’s state universities.
Last month, Rep. Bill Proctor invited the 11 
State University System presidents to discuss “ideas that could facilitate excellence in Flori-da’s state university institutions and system,” he wrote in a letter.
Proctor, who is the chair of the state House 
education committee, outlined seven main points he wishes each president to address: uni-versity proﬁ  le, STEM (science, technology, en-gineering, math), general education, research, collaboration, accountability and mission. 
A particular emphasis will be placed on the 
interaction of STEM programs and broader, general education. 
University presidents will be asked how 
their schools will address the state’s need for STEM graduates.
Proctor also wants to know how presidents 
will ensure students graduate with strong problem-solving and critical-thinking skills, re-gardless of their majors. 
Jane Adams, vice president of University 
Relations, said the education committee meet-ing will be interesting because Proctor indi-cated it will be more of a conversation than a 
hearing.
President Machen will 
cover the points Proctor asked the university presi-dents to discuss, but it’s hard to predict where the conver-sation will go, Adams said. 
The legislature’s increased 
focus on higher education is encouraging, she said.
“We welcome the increased transparency ,” 
she said. 
During the 2011 session, the legislature ap-proved a budget for UF that was $54 million less than the previous year’s budget.
A state Senate budget meeting previously 
scheduled for today was canceled.
In December, state Senate Budget Commit-
tee Chair J.D. Alexander made a massive data request from Florida’s 11 State University Sys-tem schools, asking for all university revenues and expenditures, detailed degree cost com-parisons and job placement data, large dona-tions to the universities and executive travel expenses, among others. 
After receiving the information, which to-
taled 5,000 pages, Alexander decided Wednes-day to cancel the meeting.
Machen to talk higher education with House committee� THEY SAY THE MEDIA READ 
TOO MUCH INTO HIS SUCCESS.

“When’s Tim Tebow going to be 
made a saint?”
At the Gator Wesley Foundation’s 
Bible Study on Wednesday, a student 
had asked the question as a joke, but it prompted a serious discussion.
“Well, ﬁ  rst, he’d have to be Cath-
olic,” said the Rev. David Fuquay, Gator Wesley’s executive director.
But some say Tebow’s dedication 
to his faith is not a laughing matter. Gainesville Christian student min-istries have been following his suc-cess with the Denver Broncos, and they’re not the only ones.
Between a “Saturday Night Live” 
skit parodying Tebow and Jesus in the locker room and the rise of Tebowing, it seems like fans can’t get enough of the Christian quarter-back.
Some are even calling him the 
“Mile High Messiah.”Fuquay said this might not be a 
good thing.
“‘Fan’ is short for ‘fanatic,’ and 
I think we’ve gotten a little too fa-natical,” he said. “The people who project on him, calling him ‘Jesus’ — which is ridiculous. It’s bordering on idolatry.”
The fans place unreasonable ex-
pectations on him, Fuquay said.
“I think Tebow’s faith in God is 
so much who he is that it does affect what kind of player he is,” Fuquay said. “But that’s not the same as say-ing that God is intervening super-naturally in these games.”
The media reads too much into 
Tebow’s success, said vice presi-dent of UF’s Campus Crusade Ryan Delk.
For example, NBC Sports report-
ed a smoke cloud that formed a halo over Mile High Stadium on Sunday.
“Whenever you have a situation 
where a person is in the spotlight, there’s going to be incentives for people to try to read into things that aren’t there,” Delk said.
Media outlets make a bigger deal 
of Tebow’s religion than he does, said Eddie Gilley, director of UF Baptist Collegiate Ministries.
“Because he is a Christian who is 
a football player, not a football play-er who is a Christian, they’re having trouble coming to grips with who he is on and off the ﬁ  eld,” Gilley said.
Gilley thinks Tebow would be 
bothered by people mocking his faith.
Fuquay agreed.“When kneeling on your knee in 
prayer becomes being called ‘Tebow-ing’ instead of praying, that’s taking it the wrong way,” he said.
Religious leaders: Messianic Tebow talk should be tempered

When Patric Young is posting 
up and waiting for a pass, it usu-
ally takes the Gators a day to find him.
During film sessions the fol-lowing day, and in practice, coach Billy Donovan drills the need for Florida to maintain an inside-out approach to compliment the NCAA’s top 3-point shooting at-tack.
With Young as the only starter 
to not attempt a three this sea-son, getting the junior center in scoring position has been No. 19 Florida’s (13-4, 1-1 Southeastern Conference) focus as it travels to take on South Carolina (8-8, 0-2 SEC) Saturday at 7 p.m.
“That is one of the challenges 
that we’re having in the team,” Donovan said. “Our guys are looking for Young, and I think for Erving Walker and Kenny Boyn-ton, it is a different frontcourt for them than what they’ve had to deal with in the first two years.”
Last season, center Vernon 
Macklin and forward Alex Tyus made entry passes into the paint easy with their ability to gain deep position close to the basket. 
But this year, with perimeter-
oriented forward Erik Murphy at times leaving the 6-foot-9 Young to work alone in the post, the transition to a new frontline has not always gone smoothly.
“There are things that we run 
for Young to get him touches, but teams are going to start tak-ing those things away,” Donovan said. “We need to get better at making those decisions, of recog-nizing him.”
In the Gators’ pair of SEC 
games, Young was limited to sin-gle-digit shot attempts, despite the fact he’s shot below 50 percent only once in his last 10 outings. 
Donovan said there were op-
portunities to feed Young the ball when he rolled off screens in Florida’s league-opening loss to Tennessee, but UF’s guards were unable to make the extra pass.
“Coach was telling us to get

Young tough to find in scoring position

With Florida trailing 53-49 
and just more than two min-
utes to play, senior guard Lan-ita Bartley stole the ball from Georgia’s Jasmine Johnson and started up the floor.
Bartley sent the ball to se-
nior guard Jordan Jones, who passed to junior forward Jenni-fer George in the paint.
George took a hop step but 
forgot to dribble, turning the ball over with 2:03 remaining.
The late traveling call was 
one of multiple missed oppor -
tunities for the Gators (11-6, 1-3 Southeastern Conference) in a 61-55 loss to the No. 19 Bull-dogs (14-3, 3-1 SEC) Thursday.
“I’m just — as I know our 
team is — really frustrated with playing such tremendous second halves, but having to overcome so much because we play so poorly in the first half,” coach Amanda Butler said. 
The slow start, Florida’s 
most glaring error, stemmed from shooting woes that had the Gators playing catch-up from the get-go.
Florida went into halftime 
trailing 29-16, failing to reach 20 points before the break for a second consecutive game.
“We can’t have those slow 
starts, especially in the SEC,” said senior guard Deana Allen, who scored 13 of her 14 points in the second half. “You’re not guaranteed to bounce back from that, even though you pick things up in the second half.”
Cold shooting from beyond 
the arc is primarily to blame for Florida’s meager offensive out-put in the first half.
The Gators were just 1 of 12 
on 3-point attempts heading into the locker room, including four missed tries by Jones, who leads UF with a 34.8 3-point percentage.
Sophomore guard Jaterra 
Bonds made the Gators’ first 3-pointer of the night at the 16:12 mark, but Florida’s next 13 tries from beyond the arc were off.
Twenty-five minutes  passed 
before Al-len ended the drought, finding the 
bottom of the basket for three points with 11:12 left to play.
“We’ve just got to under -
stand what teams are trying to make us do,” Allen said. “[Georgia] started taking away our penetration.”
An inability to score consis-
tently also negated the Gators’ success in the battle on the boards.
Florida outrebounded Geor -
gia 38-30, including a 22-6 ad-vantage on the offensive glass.
However, the Gators man-
aged only eight second-chance points, which tied the Bulldogs’ total on 16 fewer opportunities.Cold shooting, slow 
start again doom UF
THE TOM GREEN SHOW
Florida running back Jeff 
Demps finally came to his senses.
Demps, who had pro football 
aspirations just two months ago, announced Thursday he has decid-ed to put those lifelong dreams on the backburner and pursue a career in track.
Back in November, just days 
before Thanksgiving, Demps was asked by reporters about his future beyond UF. 
If you’re selected in the NFL Draft, will you definitely go pro?
“Yeah, definitely,” Demps said.Does that mean you’re going to 
blow off the Olympics in London?
“Yeah, I mean coming up, like 
the Olympics, it wasn’t there. I was always a football guy that watched football, and when I started run-ning in high school, I started to look into track.”
Will you go to the Olympic trials 
regardless?
“I haven’t planned on it. All of 
my focus is on football.”Do you 
plan to run track in the spring?
“I’m not 
sure. Prob-ably not.”
Would  
g e t t i n g 
drafted mean track is over for you?
“Yeah.”Do you really intend to stick by 
what you said as a freshman, that you’re a football guy?“Yeah, yeah definitely. I wasn’t 
lying about that.”
So your dream is the NFL, not the 
Olympics?
“Yeah, I was always a football 
guy first.”
But sometime between then 
and Thursday, Demps changed his tune — and he couldn’t have made a better decision.
While Demps was good at foot-
ball, and would have undoubtedly signed with an NFL team, his po-tential in track far exceeds what he had on the gridiron. Demps was always fast, and he took advantage of it on the football field, sprint-ing past would-be defenders en route to 2,470 career rushing yards (eighth in school history) and 23 touchdowns in his four seasons.
However, during his college 
career, Demps never registered 100 carries in a season and had trouble staying healthy during his junior and senior campaigns. Both of those brought into question his 
For all his hesitation, Demps ultimately made right choice

durability and whether or not his 
5-foot-7, 191-pound frame could withstand the wear and tear of an NFL season.
On the track, Demps is a 
world-class sprinter — not just an undersized football player who can outrun defenders. He is a five-time All-American who has run multiple sub-10-second times in the 100-meter sprint and won an NCAA title back in March — all while running at a bulked up football weight.
With his focus shifted to track, 
Demps will undoubtedly shed 10-15 pounds. When that hap-pens, he can be scary-fast and become a legitimate medal threat at the summer games, should he qualify at the U.S. Olympic trials in late June.
Because his ceiling is higher 
on the track, Demps’ bank ac-count will benefit more from the endorsements that can come from that career than one in the NFL. 
Demps’ decision to pursue 
track also makes sense for his well-being in the long run. In the NFL, running backs have a short shelf life and take a lot of pound-ing, bringing the possibility of brain damage later in life.
Luckily, Demps didn’t have 
the sense knocked out of him during his four years on the grid-iron; he showed as much with Thursday’s decision.

Shawn Janetzke / Alligator StaffGeorge’s double-double streak ends
“That’s what we feed off of, 
that’s where we get our energy 
from when we’re crashing the boards and we’ve been dominant,” Allen said. “But we also have to be tough and able to reward our -
selves for just banging like that in the paint and getting those second-chance shots.”George and Bartley led UF’s 
rebound effort, grabbing a game-high eight rebounds each.
George, who led UF with 15 
points, fell two rebounds short of extending her consecutive double-double streak to nine games.
Much like last Sunday’s 49-
44 loss to South Carolina, Florida made its move in the second half.
Facing a 14-point deficit, the 
Gators went on a 13-2 run to make the score 40-37 in favor of the Bull-dogs with 9:26 left in regulation.
Georgia then stymied the ral-
ly, outscoring Florida 11-4 over the next 5:02 and rendering the Gators’ last-ditch comeback effort too little, too late.
“We’ve got to get a better start,” 
Butler said. “We’ve got to score in the first half. We can’t beat good teams in the SEC scoring 16 points in the first 20 minutes.”

Florida plans to utilize more freshmen early this season, and juniors Ashanée 
Dickerson (left) and Marissa King have taken on leadership roles.
Young’s scoring pivotal in quality wins against Arizona, FSU
the ball inside,” Boynton said. 
“You can’t stare down the post. They did a great job trying to deny passes and we gotta do a better job at cutting back-door.”
Even with all the struggles 
distributing from the perimeter, Donovan said the ability to get post scoring also relies on Young battling harder. Though he touched the ball 23 times against UAB and 13 times in the first half against Tennessee, most of the time Young was too far away from the basket to be a threat.
“That is something that he has 
to get better at,” Donovan said. “We can win when he is consis-tently shut down because you have to defend 
and rebound. If they do try and shut him down, there is always going to be something else open.”
While the 
two strongest 
victories on Florida’s resume — Arizona on Dec. 7 and Florida State on Dec. 22 — came at home and included Young scoring 15 or more points on a combined 22 shots, the same conviction to get-ting him the ball hasn’t been seen away from the O’Connell Center.
In the Gators’ four road losses, 
Young has seen that production tail off, only breaking 10 attempts in the first loss of the season to Ohio State. 
“One thing that I would say 
about our team, that I really like, is that everything we are asking them to try and do, they are try-ing to do,” Donovan said. “They recognize that Young is a force inside and there needs to be a bal-ance.”

The Gators are excited for their home opener 
tonight against Illinois-Chicago, but coach Rhonda 
Faehn is looking ahead.
Instead of having her top gymnasts exhaust 
themselves as all-around competitors every week-end, Faehn said she will hold back some of her players for the sake of finishing strong. 
“One thing we’re really trying to focus on is not 
getting caught up in what’s going to happen right now,” she said. 
“We have to look at what our goal is for the 
long-run of the season. Of course, every competi-tion that we go out and compete in, we want to win.”
Pacing was an issue for UF throughout last sea-
son. After peaking at the end of February, then-No. 1 Florida stumbled to finish the year, placing second at the Southeastern Conference Championships to eventual 2011 national title winner Alabama.

ships’ semifinal competition in April, the Gators placed seventh, missing out on a spot in the NCAA Super Six team final by .075 points.
“We were so strong throughout the end of Feb-
ruary, and it was a little bit hard to hold on physi-cally to the end of the season,” Faehn said.
“We’re working on making sure we start very 
slow this season and pace ourselves and continue to get better and build up.”
So when No. 3 Florida (1-0) takes on UIC (1-0) 
in the O’Connell Center tonight at 7, Faehn said her freshmen will get many opportunities to compete while the upperclassmen rest. Faehn said it’s challenging to hold back her 
more experienced gymnasts, but some are embrac-ing leadership roles. 
Although they are only juniors, All-Americans 
Ashanée Dickerson and Marissa King have become role models for the freshmen gymnasts and have gradually gained their trust and respect. 
“I’ve really tried to step up to that position 
through just giving the girls advice,” said King, who won 2011 NCAA Vault title. 
Dickerson, on the other hand, has taken a differ -
ent approach to leading the youngsters. 
“I’m more like the person who leads by exam-
ple,” Dickerson said. “Marissa’s the outgoing per -
son and she’s more talkative than I am. She’s the 
vocal leader.”
While Dickerson 
and King are rallying the troops, Faehn is focused on the Gators’ 
long-term durability.
“(We have to) make sure that we have everyone 
at the end of the season at their best freshness, their best health,” Faehn said.
“The regular season isn’t as important as the 
end of the season.”
Injury update: Florida will likely be without 
one of its key contributors tonight.
Sophomore Mackenzie Caquatto is out with 
an ankle injury she sustained at the final selection camp for the U.S. world championships team back in September, although she is working on balance beam and uneven bars routines in practice. 
Faehn said last Friday that Caquatto would re-
turn to the bars lineup in a couple of weeks, and to beam in about four-to-six weeks. Gators easing into start of season
