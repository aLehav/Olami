TALLAHASSEE — The 
people who stared down at 
the fourth ﬂ  oor lobby of the 
Capitol building Wednesday 
may not have immediately understood what was happening.
With questioning eyes, 
bystanders watched as more than 150 pairs of leather dress shoes and shiny high heels shufﬂ  ed quietly into 
the lobby.
But when the clock struck 
1 p.m., and some of the 
crowds’ gray-black business 
attire was covered by red 
T-shirts with bold, white lettering, it was clear — these were Florida college students, and this was Rally 
in Tally.
The annual event was 
hosted by the Florida 
Student Association, an 
organization comprised 
of all the state university Student Body presidents, attracted students from UF, Florida State University, the 
University of North Florida 
and other Florida schools to Tallahassee to lobby for student initiatives.
About 30 UF students 
joined the charge Wednesday.
UF’s External Affairs 
ofﬁ  ce organized a charter bus that was available and free 
for UF students interested 
in attending the rally. Most of the attendees represented the Student Senate and 
the Freshman Leadership 
Council.  
Jessica Sullivan, a 19-
year-old UF public relations freshman, said participating 
in the rally is one of the best 
opportunities students have for their voices to be heard by state legislators.
“It’s one thing picking up 
a phone or writing a letter or sending an email,” she said.  “It’s another thing when they see student leaders face 
to face who are representing 
their school and ﬁ  ghting for what we need to make our institutions better.”
Some of the issues UF 
students lobbied for included supporting in-state tuition for undocumented students and providing funding for 
the renovation of Newell 
Hall on campus.
Davis Bean, a 21-year-old 
political science junior and 
UF student senator, said he 
rallied for and supported all

The Society of Hispanic Profes-
sional Engineers wants to make 
students’ days a little sunnier.
The society is planning to in-
stall three solar charging stations on campus in late April, said Pablo Corredor, the group’s vice 
president of technology affairs.
“We want to make it aestheti-cally pleasing,” Corredor said. 
“We want to put it right in your face.” 
The solar 
charging sta-tions will have USB ports and water-resistant 
outlets, and they 
will be placed near benches around campus.
The charging stations will 
have a 100-watt panel capable of charging one and a half laptops at all times. The panels will also come equipped with battery sys-tems that will store power and keep the panels functional even 
in inclement weather, he said.
The design of the charging sta-
tions also calls for an LCD screen 
that will show the charge of the 
battery, how much energy the 
station has accumulated during the day and how much energy the station has accumulated dur-ing its lifetime. 
The panels last between 20 and Solar charging coming to UF campus

The football lottery is now open to part-
time students.
Starting April 14, undergraduate students 
enrolled in six credit hours can participate in 
the lottery. The graduate student requirement will remain the same at six credit hours.Travis Leyndyke, the director of ticket op-
erations, wrote in an email that the change was because part-time students wanted to partici-pate in the lottery.
“This will not only beneﬁ  t the students 
who are now eligible to purchase tickets,” he said, “but it will help make The Swamp game day atmosphere special and one of the best in the country.”Before the change, undergraduate students 
were required to be enrolled in 12 credits to participate.
With one extra game this Fall, lottery ticket 
prices have risen since last year. Students this year will have to pay $105 for seven home games compared to the $90 for six games in 
2013. Each game typically costs $15.
Lottery announcements will be made on 
Aug. 1.
Holly Davis, a 20-year-old UF health edu-
cation and behavior junior, said the six-hour 
credit change will allow more students to at-tend games.
“Students should be able to enter the lot-
tery if they’re only taking six credits,” she said. “They’re still a part of the Gator Nation.”Part-time students now eligible for $105 football ticket lotteryStudents lobby

This year’s Hogtown Craft Beer 
Festival is letting the festivities brew 
a little longer than usual.
The Hogtown Brewers, a lo-
cal home-brewing club, is kicking 
off the third-annual festival early 
with the ﬁ  rst Gainesville Craft Beer Week, starting at 7 p.m. Saturday.
Students and residents can enjoy 
special prices on local beer with a weeklong pub crawl leading up to the festival on April 5.
Hogtown Brewers club organiz-
er Mark Tumarkin wrote in an email  
although this is the pub crawl’s ﬁ  rst 
year, businesses were eager to get involved.
Eva Strickland, the manager of 
Big Lou’s New York Style Pizzeria, said she’s excited to participate.  
“We have a really great variety 
of craft beers that a lot of people don’t know about,” she said. “The 
pub crawl is a great way to spread the word.”
The festival itself will be held 
April 5 at 1 p.m. at Kanapaha Gar-
dens, 4700 SW 58th Drive. In ad-dition to promoting craft beer, the Hogtown Brewers will also hold seminars and demonstrations.
“Part of our mission as a home-
brew club is beer education,” Tu-
markin said. “People are learning 
that there’s a lot more pleasure in drinking ﬂ  avorful craft beers rather than the industrial ‘ﬁ  zzy yellow stuff.’”
Lisa Ruderman, a 22-year-old 
UF public relations senior who will be attending the Hogtown Craft 
Beer Festival for her second time 
this year, said she’s looking forward to the wider range of craft beers. 
Tumarkin said the festival will 
feature more than 65 breweries and more than 200 beers — almost dou-ble last year’s offerings. 
“I want to try all of them,” Rud-
erman said. “But I want to remem-ber them all, too.”Craft Beer Week startsLOCAL� SHE’S HOPING TO RAISE

A UF student is making the 
world a more beautiful place with 
her women’s toiletry drive.
Shanelle Benjamin, a 20-year-
old UF public relations junior, is 
holding her ﬁ  rst on-campus toiletry 
drive, called Beauty’s Escape, ben-eﬁ  tting women of domestic vio-lence and homeless women in the Gainesville community. The drive started Tuesday and runs until April 4, although it may be extend-ed, she said.
“You never know when you’ll 
be on the other side,” she said. “Now that you have the opportu-nity to help someone, you should take advantage of that.”
Benjamin, the community af-
fairs assistant director of UF’s Black Student Union, is collecting beauty items such as feminine products, moisturizers, body sprays and hair products at the BSU ofﬁ  ce on the third ﬂ  oor of the Reitz Union and the Reitz Union Information Desk.
She said she’s expecting to raise 
more than $150 and collect more than 100 items. Donations will be 
delivered to St. Francis House, 
Peaceful Paths and other charitable organizations.
Benjamin said she started do-
ing toiletry drives after she ran into a woman in need of supplies at St. Francis House, a homeless shelter and soup kitchen.
“Although I only had three or four pads, I saw her face light up,” she said. “I made a difference that quick.”
Benjamin said collecting beauty 
products for women helps boost 
their conﬁ  dence, especially victims 
of domestic violence.
“Being able to take care of your-self gives you a sense of control,” she said.
Julie Karr, a communications 
specialist at HealthStreet, said one of the great things about student organizations like BSU is that they 
increase HealthStreet’s capacity to 
collect items.
HealthStreet, a community en-
gagement program that works to reduce disparities in health care and health research, has a toiletry pantry in its facility that is open to the public on Wednesdays and Fri-days to collect items, she said.

Gators who fear a lifetime of paying off student 
loans can look to the Pacific Northwest for hope.
A bill proposed in the Washington House of 
Representatives would create a pay-it-forward 
program for paying college tuition. 
If the bill passes, students would attend school 
tuition-free and then contribute a fixed percentage 
of their income — no more than 5 percent — to a 
common education fund upon receiving a job post-graduation.
In 2013, Oregon legislators passed a bill ordering 
a higher education commission to decide whether 
the program would work in their states. 
But Florida legislators have yet to show interest 
in pursuing a similar program.
Brittany Davis, the Florida Board of Governors 
communications director, said one of the factors 
the board considers when allocating funds to universities is how accessible the schools are to students. 
“The Board of Governors is following all tuition 
proposals with interest and believes the system must demonstrate the value it creates and move into an era of performance funding,” she said.But Larry Kenny, a UF economics professor, 
is skeptical of the success of a pay-it-forward program.
“Yale had a program like this back in the ‘70s, 
and they shut it down,” Kenny said. “Basically, you’re allowing people to be a librarian at a low salary and saying that 4 percent of their income will pay off their loan over time, when sometimes, the 
proportion just isn’t high enough.”
But for students like Colby Royce who are 
worried about accumulating debt, the program 
sounds like a good idea. 
The 21-year-old UF finance junior will have to 
take out loans for graduate school.
“The opportunity to avoid paying interest, which 
is just lost money that’s not going to your education, would give students the chance to pursue a career 
they truly would be happier in,”  she said.
of the higher education issues.  
“That’s something that all 
students can get behind,” he said. 
“A lot of the times you hear that 
younger generations aren’t involved 
in things like this, so it’s great to come here and see representatives from colleges all around Florida showing we are passionate about 
things we care about.”
The students attended Senate and 
House of Representatives sessions 
and were publicly recognized by 
both.
Several Rally in Tally partici-
pants live-tweeted their experiences 
in and photos from the state capital using #RallyinTally.
 UF students also listened to 
supporters from the Capitol speak about the initiatives they traveled nearly 150 miles to lobby for.
Sen. Jeanette Nuñez, chair 
of the higher education board and workforce subcommittee, supported granting in-state tuition to undocumented students in a speech at the rally.
“There are students right now 
in Florida that have grown up here 
and have gone to our public schools, 
and yet when they reach … their graduation day from high school, they find a closed door waiting 
for them,” she said. “We’re here 
because fighting for these students is fighting for a brighter, more educated state of Florida.” 
Ben Weiner, an 18-year-old UF 
political science and economics freshman, agreed that by actually going to meet with legislators, students can strongly impact the 
future of their schools.
“By us coming up here and 
speaking with different legislators, 
it puts a face to a bill in the House or Senate,” he said. “I support the 
University of Florida, and in any 
way that we can improve it … tuition equality, funding for campus, not only affects current students but 
future students as well.”4, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, MARCH 27, 2014

A local tattoo shop prom-
ises the same atmosphere in  
its new, larger location open-
ing in April.
Anthem Tattoo Parlor is 
moving to an 1,800-square-
foot space at 230 NW Second 
Ave. on April 15. It will vacate 
its current Southwest Sixth Street location. 
The Victorian-style home 
it’s moving to will provide 
additional room for custom-
ers and employees and will also launch the opening of the Zorka Rose Art Gallery & 
Shoppe.
“This new building will 
have ample space for us and 
our customers,” said Mike Salay, owner of the 8-year-old 
parlor. He said they’ve been 
considering an expansion for almost a year.
Salay said increased cus-
tomer business and a larger staff have made the idea of re-locating possible. The business now houses six tattoo artists, he said, exceeding the shop’s 
four-person workspace. 
Along with more space, 
he said he hopes Anthem’s patrons will benefit from the 
gallery, which will display vintage items and local art for sale. Its goal is to collaborate 
with Artwalk Gainesville art-
ists and other creatives, he said.
“We want people to appre-
ciate all forms of art, especially 
tattooing,” Salay said. 
The location may also be 
more convenient for attendees 
of the Fest, an annual punk 
rock music festival. Anthem 
participates every year offer-ing special-edition tattoos to people who attend the event. 
Co-owner Samantha Salay 
said Anthem’s new space will help the parlor at this year’s festival by offering more room to accommodate customers 
at a location closer to down-
town.
Gainesville native Miran-
da Cullen was in the shop Wednesday night with a 
friend who was waiting to get 
a tattoo. Cullen, 20, said she thinks the move will generate more business.
“I think they deserve a 
bigger place because they are really cool tattoo artists,” she said. “I think it will be really good for them.”

Stations will need minimal upkeep
25 years, and the batteries last up 
to three years. The three systems will cost $1,500 each and will be 
funded through UF’s College of 
Engineering.
Corredor said only the society 
will be involved in maintaining 
the charging stations, and it pre-
dicts that the stations won’t need much maintenance except for oc-casional cosmetic issues. 
The first three stations, which 
will hopefully be installed in late April, will be pilots for the pro-gram so the group can see how much the stations are being used.
Corredor said this is the larg-
est project the organization has been involved in.
“Every year we want to carry 
out a couple of projects that are 
completely different from what-
ever it is we did last time,” Corre-dor said.
Katherine Nemecek, a 19-year-old UF sport management soph-omore, said she would use the charging stations. She said being 
environmentally friendly is im-
portant to her.
“I make sure to recycle and un-
plug my chargers when I’m not using them,” Nemecek said.
In the group’s preliminary 
surveys, it found 70 percent of students bring their chargers to campus, a statistic Corredor said 
he finds encouraging because it 
shows students will use the solar chargers. He said his dream is to install these chargers at universi-ties throughout Florida.solAR , from page 1 “I make sure to recycle

Members of UF’s No Southern 
Accent might soon take their talents 
to television.
The 16-person coed a cappella 
group is in talks with the associate 
producer of Animal Planet’s “Ghost-
land Tennessee” and the founder of Smith Multimedia Entertainment LLC, Ben Smith, about starring in a reality show based on the 2012 hit comedy “Pitch Perfect.”C.J. Wittus, the president of No 
Southern Accent, said the similari-ties between the movie and the real-
ity of a cappella life might surprise 
viewers.
“They want to present what is be-
coming a college norm to the public so they can see what it’s actually like to be part of an a cappella group,” said the 22-year-old UF criminology senior.
Smith declined to comment, but 
Wittus said he believes the show would begin filming early next year, subject to UF approval. It would take place in Gainesville and follow group members through the audi-tioning process, tri-weekly practices, competitions and gigs, he said.
After one of the busiest and most 
exciting years the group has had, 
Wittus said being discovered by 
Smith Multimedia seemed like a reward. The group participated in producer auditions with “America’s Got Talent,” sang on a Royal Carib-bean cruise and won ICCA, the In-ternational Championship of Colle-giate A Cappella.
Although Wittus said the group is like a family, some members were not convinced the close-knit dynam-ic would protect it from the pres-sures of reality TV.
Spencer Jordan, a second-year 
No Southern Accent member, said reality shows tend to focus more on drama than what the show is actu-ally about. 
“It’s really funny to watch, but 
generally that’s not something I’d want to be a part of,” the 20-year-old UF family, youth and commu-nity sciences sophomore said. “The camera can do some weird things to people.”
However, the group met last 
week to address potential concerns about the show and decided it was worth the risk.
“I don’t really know what kind 
of opportunity it is or what doors it opens for us, but it’s definitely an ex-perience,” Jordan said, “and pretty once-in-a-lifetime.”

Gainesville Police arrested a local 
man Tuesday after detectives discov-
ered about 40 grams of molly at his house.
Officers arrested 29-year-old Anil 
Rajdeo Ganaishlal on charges of traf-ficking in MDMA and possession of a controlled substance, according to an arrest report. 
At about 4 p.m., detectives with 
the Gainesville-Alachua County Drug Task Force carried out a search warrant for the house where Ganaishlal lives, located in the 2800 block of Southwest 
101st Terrace. 
Once inside, detectives found 
a Tupperware container with 24.3 
grams of MDMA. Then, detectives found a plastic bag with 13.85 grams of the same substance, according to the report. 
Detectives took another plastic bag 
with five clear capsules that tested positive for molly. 
They found a total of 39.65 grams 
throughout the house, according to the report. An average dose of MDMA is  about .125 grams, which means Ga-naishlal had the equivalent of about 317 doses.
During questioning, Ganaishlal 
said the drug items were his, accord-ing to the report. 
Officers booked Ganaishlal into the 
Alachua County Jail at about 8:30 p.m., where he remained as of press time in lieu of a $45,000 bond for MDMA charges and an $8,000 bond for other marijuana charges.  Police find about 300 
doses of molly at house

TAMPA — Thrill ride develop-
ers at Busch Gardens acknowledge 
that the park’s newest attraction might not be everyone’s idea of a good time.
Falcon’s Fury will open May 1. 
Riders will be seated upright and whisked to the top of a 335-foot tower. Then, the seat will pivot 90 degrees so the guests are looking straight down.
That’s when the ride plunges in 
a six-second free fall.
Jeff Hornick, director of design 
and engineering at Busch Gardens, said riders will reach speeds of up to 60 miles per hour on the plunge.
“It’s a different kind of thrill ride 
than a roller coaster,” said Hornick. “It’s really polarizing. You’re either really going to want to ride it or not want to ride it at all.”
Park officials say it’s the tallest 
free-standing drop tower in North America and the only one in the world to feature forward tilting seats.
“Drop towers have been popu-
lar at theme parks for many years, but what you see with Falcon’s Fury is the industry’s relentless drive for innovation,” said Jeremy Schoolfield, editor-in-chief of Fun-world Magazine. “Ride designers 
are always looking for new twists 
on classic attractions, and Fury’s pivoting seats certainly fit that bill. Putting riders in a facedown position as they drop toward the ground is definitely a new take on this type of ride.”
There are taller drop towers in 
the U.S., but they are integrated with other rides or buildings. Lex Luthor: Drop of Doom at Six Flags 
Magic Mountain in California has a 
400-foot drop and the Zumanjaro: Drop of Doom at Six Flags Great Adventure in New Jersey will have a 415-foot drop when it’s construct-ed later this year. Both of those are attached to other rides. A famous drop tower is the Big Shot, the ride atop the Stratosphere hotel and casino in Las Vegas that catapults 
riders 160 feet in the air.
Falcon’s Fury stands alone, and 
Hornick said guests can see down-
town Tampa and even St. Peters-burg some 30 miles away once at the top.
Guests must be 54 inches tall 
to ride. A circular gondola of 32 seats takes the riders to the top of the tower. Once there, a computer program determines how long the riders will stay at the peak before the gut-wrenching plunge.
Hornick said the wait time at the 
top will be randomized anywhere from one to five seconds.
“The only thing you’re going to 
hear is your heart beat,” he joked.
On the 60 mile-per-hour drop, 
the seats will be pulled back, to give riders a feeling of “ripping” a parachute cord, Hornick said.
Busch Gardens to open roller coaster thriller with a new twist

KEY BISCAYNE, Fla. — Police briefly 
stopped vehicle and foot traffic outside the 
Sony Open Tennis tournament Tuesday night because of an unattended backpack left near the main gate. Authorities then found the bag did not present any safety risk.
Detective Roy Rutland of the Miami-Dade 
Police Department said personnel working at the tournament discovered the bag. Rutland said the department’s bomb squad responded “to mitigate the potential threat,” and traffic was allowed to resume flowing.
Players on site at the time were made aware 
of the situation.
“There was a bomb threat and a lockdown, 
but that’s all I know about it,” women’s No. 1 seed Serena Williams said shortly after the 
situation ended. “Scary.”
The investigation was announced during a 
match between Williams and Angelique Ker-ber, which proceeded as scheduled. Hundreds 
of people were trying to leave the facility after the match and were stopped at the gate before being allowed to exit the tennis center.
A men’s match between Rafael Nadal and 
Fabio Fognini began shortly after police gave the all-clear. 
Nadal and Fognini were warming up

tax credit program 
needs work
Florida has been a popular destination for ﬁ  lm producers 
for decades. From “Girl Happy,” a 1965 ﬁ  lm starring Elvis Presley shot in Fort Lauderdale, to “Miami Vice” and then 
“Burn Notice,” our East Coast beaches are attractive options. 
Proponents of the entertainment industry taking advan-
tage of Florida’s resources argue that Sunshine State exposure through ﬁ  lm stimulates the economy and increases tourism. They’ve been pushing for Florida to expand its tax credit pro-gram and increase the number of incentives given to those who ﬁ  lm in-state, the Tampa Bay Times reported. Since 2003, the entertainment industry incentive program has distributed $296 million in tax credits to various projects.
Now, according to Integrity Florida, a research institute and 
watchdog agency, members of the ﬁ  lm industry are pressuring 
the state for a $1 billion package to subsidize the production of 
movies, TV shows, video games and other entertainment indus-try productions through 2020.
The arguments made by those in Hollywood are appealing. 
After all, who can argue with encouraging projects that pump “$1.6 billion into Florida’s economy and (create) more than 190,000 temporary jobs,” as some ofﬁ  cials have claimed? 
However, there’s more to the story. None of the data is backed up by hard numbers. Florida 
Watchdog reported that the Ofﬁ  ce of Film and Entertainment, a ﬁ  ve-person operation that oversees the subsidy program, hides itself from the public eye. Although the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity’s website offers “unprecedented access” to taxpayer-funded incentive contracts such as to the ﬁ  lm indus-try, no information about the OFE is available. 
This lack of transparency was called into question by the In-
tegrity Florida report. 
“The Ofﬁ  ce of Film and Entertainment ... does not always 
disclose online both the speciﬁ  c value of the tax credit awards along with the actual production company names of the recipi-ents,” the report’s key research ﬁ  ndings stated. 
The report also called into question the program’s lack of 
compliance with state statutes and its ﬁ  rst-come, ﬁ  rst-served practice of awarding incentive deals rather than discerning which projects would bring more revenue than others. 
In moving forward, Integrity Florida didn’t advocate reject-
ing the $1 billion proposal — rather, it recommended revamping 
the entertainment industry incentive program. Obviously, legis-
lators and business owners would prefer ﬁ  lms choose Florida as a shooting location rather than Georgia or Alabama; thus, it’s in the state’s best interest to keep Florida attractive to producers. 
Integrity Florida recommended more online disclosure, full 
compliance with Sunshine State Law’s open-meeting regula-tions, increased ﬁ  scal responsibility for incentive deals and more objectivity and oversight when it comes to approving grants for certain projects. 
It’s in the state legislator’s capacity to implement these chang-
es. Before making a $1 billion investment of taxpayer dollars, we 
hope they do so. Like many other Gators, I was born and raised here 
in the Sunshine State. I’ve never lived anywhere else, so I am a product of the Florida school sys-
tem.
Unlike some Gators, I had the misfortune of attend-
ing a private school until seventh grade. It wasn’t all bad, but by about sixth grade, I knew I had to switch schools. The work was too easy. When I did transfer to a public school, not only was I stimulated by the better education I received, but I was also able to engage in a number of electives and extracurriculars unavailable at the private schools I attended. 
It’s also worth noting these schools were Christian. 
We had chapel on Wednesdays and an hour of Bible in-
struction daily. I was a devout Christian growing up, 
attended church three times a week and wanted to be a preacher. I loved the private schools I went to, but not as much as the public schools. 
Private schools are good because they give parents 
choices in their children’s education. But despite a repu-tation for giving students a superior education, studies show that isn’t true. Many of them are also religious. 
To give low-income families an opportunity to attend 
these supposedly superior private schools, 14 states use tax dollars to offer vouchers so children can attend. There is an issue here: Taxpayer dollars are going to fund religious instruction. If that isn’t a breach of the separation of church and state, I don’t know what is. 
At one end of the spectrum, religious parents are 
afraid of teachers indoctrinating their children with theories of how the world formed that differ from their own. On the other end are taxpayers who don’t follow 
Christian ideology and don’t want to pay for an educa-
tion they also feel indoctrinates youth with values con-trary to their own. In the middle, a big mess. 
There’s a lot that needs ﬁ  xing in America’s schools. 
This isn’t the way to do it. 
According to Politico, numerous studies have found 
there is little educational beneﬁ  t to attending private schools. Plus, private schools aren’t held to the same standards as public schools. In-stead of teaching evolution in an all-encompassing way, they teach children only how to re-fute it. One example offered is 
that genetic mutations result in 
a loss of genetic information, evidently meaning evolution is impossible. Yes, I was actu-ally taught this at the school I 
attended. No, it isn’t true.
As a contrast, creation is not taught in public schools, 
and evolution is taught in an objective way. And even though evolution is taught, 60 percent of biology teach-
ers tone down lessons on evolution to avoid controver-
sy. 
Some states even allow parents to pull their kids out 
of class when evolution is taught. But no one seems up-set when children learn the Earth orbits the sun or that gravity exists. 
Regardless, taxpayer funds don’t belong in religious 
schools’ coffers. The Friedman Foundation asked hun-dreds of families receiving tax-funded vouchers why 
they chose a private school. “Religious education” tied 
for ﬁ  rst with “better education,” according to Politico. 
The religious right fears indoctrination from a pub-
lic-school education. But think about this: If taxpayer dollars were used to send children to Muslim or Bud-dhist schools — well, the idea is so impossible it’s hard to imagine. 
We need the trickle of dollars to help bolster educa-
tion, not hinder it. Giving money to religious schools 
takes it away from public schools. If Americans are seri-
ous about improving their economy and quality of life, they need to start taking education seriously and keep religion out of it. 
Religion can be taught at home. Oftentimes, science 
can’t.

Even though Led Zeppelin may never reunite, Gainesville 
residents will soon have the next best opportunity to hear the 
band’s iconic songs live.
Get The Led Out, a Led Zeppelin cover band, will play at 
the Phillips Center for the Performing Arts on Friday. 
Appropriately dubbed “The American Zeppelin,” the 
Philadelphia-based band recreates the music of Led Zeppe-
lin by focusing on the studio overdubs that the original band 
never performed.
When Led Zeppelin performed live, the band was limited 
by its member count. Even though a recorded song may have included three guitars, the live performance of the same song 
would have incorporated only one guitar. 
Get The Led Out meticulously adheres to the recorded 
music by employing multi-instrumentalists to showcase the 
recorded music of “The Mighty Zep.”
The live performance chronicles the entirety of the original 
band’s career, showcasing classic hits and deep cuts. Get The Led Out also includes an acoustic set, which features guest vocalist Diana DeSantis singing classic songs such as “Tan-gerine” and “Battle of Evermore.”
The band started with singer Paul Sinclair and lead guitar-
ist Paul Hammond playing Led Zeppelin and Aerosmith cov-ers at a monthly gig in a club. As the word of mouth spread of their performances, more musicians wanted to get involved.
“The other musicians wanted to form a more traditional 
version of a Led Zeppelin tribute band, with the costumes and wigs and stuff, of which Paul Sinclair wanted no part of,” Hammond said. “So Get The Led Out was formed with Paul Sinclair’s concept of how he wanted to perform Led Zeppe-lin’s music.”
Sticking to the essence of the band’s recorded music re-
mains a key component of Get The Led Out. 
Although Hammond may be influenced by musicians like 
Jeff Beck and Les Paul, he said the band does not attempt to reinterpret Led Zeppelin’s music.
“Sometimes when I hear other acts out there performing 
Zeppelin’s music and it’s more of the live loosey-goosey type of thing, it drives me to perform the recorded music of Led Zeppelin more accurately,” Hammond said. “We’re all driv-en to perfection with this band, so we’re constantly separating 
the wheat from the chaff, only in a musical sense.”
This is not the first time the band has played the Phil-
lips Center, though. The band members made their way to 
Gainesville several years back and were made honorary Gators, Hammond said.
 “You can bet any time the Gators are playing I’m rooting 
for them to win,” he said.
Tickets are available at the Phillips Center for $10 for stu-
dents with Gator 1 Cards. General admission tickets can be purchased on Ticketmaster. 
The show starts at 7:30 p.m.

College is a time when you won’t be 
judged for not having your life in order, 
which means you repeatedly find yourself 
doing routine things like, oh you know, 
just grocery shopping at 2 a.m. Thankful-ly, Gainesville has several 24-hour joints where you can pick up those necessary 
items like frozen pizza and Eggo waffles 
(See: Sweetbay, Wal-Mart).
 But it’s a jungle out there, and a few 
character profiles seem to make repeat appearances. In true BuzzFeed fashion, 
here’s your I-just-needed-bread-and-milk-but-am-scared-of-that-sketchy-gas-station 
edition listicle of people you’ll see grocery shopping after midnight:
1) The late-night snacker.
This one is a dead giveaway. They’ll be 
in the ice cream aisle choosing a Ben and 
Jerry’s pint wearing PJs and maybe Uggs with said pants carelessly stuffed in the 
tops. Who dresses to impress in this place 
anyway?
2) The vegan chef.  
Dreadlocks and bandana optional. The 
first thing you’ll notice is that his shop-
ping basket is very colorful. It’s filled 
with ingredients you can’t pronounce and that look so gourmet you wonder how he managed 
to find them in a run-of-
the-mill chain grocery store like this.  You spend the whole time waiting 
behind him at the register 
wondering if he’s going straight home to 
cook, and if so, why now?
3) The eat, sleep, rave, repeater.  
This guy’ll be buying beer. Just beer. 
Lots of it. The cheap stuff. He may or may not be surrounded with a posse of haggard-yet-happy looking wingmen who just wanna keep the party going.
4) The young professional who works 
weird hours.
You’ll be able to pick these people out of the crowd because they’re always the best dressed. They may be toting a satchel 
or wearing an ID badge lanyard of some 
sort.
5) The flirty shelf stocker. He’s the one who takes the company 
policy of greeting every customer to the extreme and uses it as an excuse to strike up conversations with chicks buying cere-al at 2 a.m. When he asks if you’re finding everything OK, just say yes and move on, 
even if you’re lost trying to find your off-
brand cereal.
Maybe one day I’ll have my life togeth-
er enough to do normal things at normal 
hours. But until then, I guess I’ll just make 
late-night grocery shopping a game and play bingo with this list. The five people you’ll find grocery shopping after midnight

“If You Wait,” the debut album 
from British pop-indie collective 
London Grammar, stands to be one of the best debut albums of the past few years. The group combines the 
powerfully sultry vocals of singer 
Hannah Reid and nuanced produc-tion from Dan Rothman and Domi-nic “Dot” Major to create a truly unforgettable album.
London Grammar bares no ex-
pense in charging the listener with complex emotion. Much like art-ists such as The xx and Lana Del 
Rey, the group effectively weaves 
ethereal sound design with Reid’s remarkable voice. Often simultane-ously conveying hope, sadness and affection, Reid’s vocals and lyrics grab the listener and refuse to let go.
Although Reid’s vocals rest at 
the forefront of London Grammar, 
Rothman and Major’s produc-
tion perfectly supplement the lead singer. With deli-cate guitar licks and fragile piano keys at their dis-posal, the pair of producers pro-vides an essential 
cap to the group’s 
sound. Rothman and Major favor 
downtempo instrumentals but care-fully add enough variety to abstain from boring the listener.
The tracks, while similar in na-
ture, manage to stand apart by functioning as unique songs that also ﬂ  ow together to form a cohe-
sive work. Stand-outs include the 
philosophical, yet catchy “Strong” and the creative interpretation of Kavinsky’s “Nightcall.”
London Grammar represents an 
exciting addition to the pop-indie genre. Its layering of emotionally charged vocals over ambient pro-duction sets a benchmark for the 
genre. “If You Wait” only marks 
the beginning of a very successful career for London Grammar.London Grammar deliversmusic

Meeting new people can be fun and interesting (Omegle, 
anyone?), but talking to strangers can also be intimidating and 
awkward.
According to a recent Tic Tac commercial, 67 percent of peo-
ple could use an excuse to meet the person next to them.
The statistic was taken from a survey commissioned by the 
E-cigarette company NEO for National Fresh Breath Day, which reported that 67 percent of men and women ranked bad breath as the biggest dating turnoff.
Although offering a breath mint to a halitosis victim could be 
a useful icebreaker, a number of other conversation starters can ﬁ  ll an awkward silence.
1) Try a “Hey, did you hear about…?” approach. Asking 
people for their thoughts on current events shows you’re in-
terested in what they have to say, and if the topic is interesting 
enough, an engaging conversation is sure to kick off.
2) Take a lesson from Regina George, the mean girl who had 
no problem starting a conversation, and compliment someone 
on his or her outﬁ  t, accessories or physical features (avoid cat-
calls) — even if it is the “ugliest efﬁ  ng skirt” you’ve ever seen.
3) There’s always something interesting about a foreigner. 
If someone has an unusual or exotic accent, what’s the harm in asking about it? A simple question like  “Where 
are you from?” can lead to a string of others.
4) “How about that weather?” Luckily, 
Florida weather tends to be especially moody. 
When a freezing, foggy morning turns into a 
sunny afternoon hot enough to melt the lip 
balm in your pocket, complaining about the 
weather is so commonplace, it’s a fail-proof 
icebreaker. 
5) Comment on food. People love food, and Pinterest proves 
it. If someone is walking around with a new Starbucks drink or 
(ﬁ  ngers crossed) the ever-elusive Cronut, don’t hesitate to ask 
about it.
6) Showing your sense of humor is typically well-received. 
Even if you’re not the best comic in the world, comic relief is always appreciated and even a self-deprecating joke can help 
a conversation take off. Think hashtag speak like “FML” or 
“YOLO.”
7) For years, teachers have used the simplest icebreaker to 
date: “Tell us a little bit about yourself.” Introducing yourself with the old-fashioned “Hi, my name is…” is sometimes the 
best approach if you can’t ﬁ  nd a way to break the silence.
And, just in case you’re interested in breaking the ice with a 
breath mint, this year National Fresh Breath Day falls on Aug.

Tess Druckenmiller is a self-proclaimed 
singer/songwriter who balances both col-
lege life and a career in music. This New York City native credits her environment for her start in the industry and multiple pro-
ducers for her pop, folk and indie sound. 
With the recent re-release of her ﬁ  rst al-bum “Storyteller,” featuring her new single “Black & White,” she hopes listeners ﬁ  nd the songs relatable and appreciate the album’s variety of genres. We caught up with the up-and-coming artist, and here’s what she had to say:
 
Q. What inspired 
your new single “Black & White”?
A. That one is about 
a boy — surprise! Well, I was writing it this sum-mer and this was kind of one of those things where you ﬁ  nally just 
realize everyone has 
that person from when 
they’re a teenager and don’t really know what’s happening and they just get ﬁ  xated on one person. And I think that was kind of my realization that that wasn’t actually what 
I wanted, and I was over it. 
Q. What sets your music apart from 
what is out there right now?
A. It has a live aspect to it in the recording, 
there’s not really any electronic instruments 
and a lot of the performances are not liter-ally live from shows but are mostly acous-tic, not all, but (majority are) not electronic 
sounds. And then also a couple things, like 
“Black and White,” … I did that only with my friends. Everyone was in college, so they all went to NYU. The producer is one of my good friends. Everyone is in school so it’s kind of fun for us doing it, as everyone is try-ing to be an artist. Even the producer has his own band. That was kind of interesting to really have something that was all produced 
by college kids who are still in school.
Q. How is it balancing school and pur-
suing a career in music?
A. I’m at Brown, in Rhode Island, study-
ing computer science. It’s a lot. Obviously it 
depends on the semester … freshman year and sophomore, year there was a lot less work, so I was able to go home on weekends 
to do the recording, and there’s still time ev-
ery once in a while to go home for a show. This fall, we did a show in Nashville, and I just left for that weekend and did work on the way there and on the way back.
Q. What does this album mean to you?A. It means a lot to me obviously because 
I wrote it all, but it’s super nostalgic because there are recent ones where I’m like, ‘Oh, I wrote that last year,’ but there’s ones from when I was 17 and they’re about my best friend when I was 17 or the boy I liked … So it’s really nostalgic for me when I listen to it and it’s kind of just like … a storybook 
for me of stuff that happened to me, which 
is funny to be able to look back. It’s like I don’t have a diary but if I did it would be this album.Songwriter

During the heyday of the Florida 
Gators basketball program, coach 
Billy Donovan strung together 18 straight postseason wins — the most in the NCAA since John Wooden’s 
UCLA squad conquered 28 in a row 
en route to seven consecutive cham-pionships back in the late 1960s and early 1970s. 
Unfortunately for UCLA, Wood-
en won’t be coaching the No. 4 seed-ed Bruins (28-8) when they match up against the No. 1 seeded Gators (34-2) in Memphis, Tenn., on Thurs-day night at 9:45. 
Unfortunately for Florida, Ben 
Howland won’t be on the visitor’s bench either.
Howland faced off against Dono-
van three times — all in the NCAA Tournament — in his 10-year ten-
ure. Florida came out victorious in 
all three games, the most notable of which secured the Gators’ first national championship on April 3, 2006.But now that the Bruins have 
a new coach, Steve Alford, and an 
entirely new lineup since they last 
played the Gators in 2011, Donovan said that he is ready to see a new UCLA team.
“I mean, it doesn’t even neces-
sarily need to be UCLA right now ... You have a totally different coach, you have a totally different style of play, you have a totally different 
philosophy and you have totally dif-
ferent players,” Donovan said. “The name on the jersey happens to be the same one that we’ve maybe played three different times in the NCAA Tournament, but everything else is

Taylore Fuller plated only 
eight hits this season heading 
into No. 4 Florida’s midweek 
matchup against UCF.
But of those eight hits, five 
were home runs.
The sophomore catcher con-
tinued that trend against the 
Knights on Wednesday, hit-ting a two-out grand slam to left field as UF (31-4, 5-4 South-eastern Conference) cruised 
past UCF (24-11, 3-0 American 
Athletic Conference) 10-6 in Or-lando.
“I thought we did a good 
job with our at-bats,” coach Tim Walton said in a release. 
“We also did a really good job 
of hitting both with two strikes and with two outs.”
The Knights jumped out to a 
2-0 lead in the first inning, tak-ing advantage of an underper-forming Hannah Rogers. After 
UCF left fielder Linnea Good-
man logged an infield single and third baseman Farrah Sul-livan walked on four pitches, cleanup hitter Mariah Garcia 
hit a two-RBI double to a gap in 
left-center field.
Rogers struggled to play 
consistently against the Knights, 
walking a season-high five bat-
ters and giving up four hits and three earned runs in just four innings.
Florida cut the lead in half in 
the top of the second when Tay-
lor Schwarz hit a one-out home 
run off of UCF right-handed pitcher and former high school teammate Shelby Turnier.
After a quiet third inning 
from both teams, UF surged in the fourth frame, driving in seven runs before three outs were made.
Turnier walked Schwarz 
and Briana Little to start the in-ning. Freshman Justine McLean then reached base on a fielder’s 
choice before junior right-hand-
er Mackenzie Audas relieved Turnier in the circle.
The pitching change didn’t 
help UCF, as leadoff hitter 
Kelsey Stewart cleared the 
bases with a two-RBI double before being tagged out trying to reach third base.
UF’s next four batters 
reached base — Kirsti Merritt drew a walk, Stephanie Tofft hit an RBI double down the left-field line, Bailey Castro was 
walked and Chelsea Herndon 
reached first base on a passed ball despite striking out — to 
set up Fuller’s grand slam.
Fuller and Schwarz have 
improved their power hitting

� FLORIDA LOST TO PENN STATE IN 
ROUND OF 32.
GORDON STREISAND
Alligator Writer @GordonStreisand
Like a game in the NCAA Tournament, 
this season was “do-or-die” for coach Amanda 
Butler. 
Florida’s women’s basketball program was 
in a state of flux after a tumultuous offseason. 
Senior defensive leader and top scorer Jen-nifer George graduated. Freshman standout Sydney Moss and Chandler Cooper trans-ferred to different schools, and Vicky McIn-tyre left the program.
At the time, the Gators were one giant 
question mark. 
Incoming freshman Ronni Williams and 
transfers Antoinette Bannister and Cassie Peoples, from UNC and Texas, respectively, 
rounded the team off at 10 players entering 
the 2013-14 season. 
The Gators were picked to finish 10th in 
the Southeastern Conference a year after going 6-10 and finishing eighth in conference play.
Florida coined a “Perfect 10” motto, but the 
Gators were down to nine before they even 
stepped on the court.
Another season-
ending ACL injury to center Viktorija Dimaite shaved the Gators’ roster down 
to nine active players for their season debut, further sinking already low expectations. 
The Gators muscled their way to a 5-3 re-
cord through its first month of play. A 10th-place finish in the SEC definitely seemed rea-sonable, especially with Bannister sustaining a hand injury that left Florida with only eight players.
But December treated UF well. Florida went undefeated to close out 2013 
and opened up 2014 with an impressive nine-game stretch that featured an overtime thriller against Georgetown, two consecutive 
100-point games, a 31-point performance from 
embattled sophomore Christin Mercer and Florida overcomes low expectations despite tourney losssee hooPs, PA ge 15

Gators beat Bruins thricereally a lot different.”
The differences start at the 
top between these two schools. 
Rick Pitino mentored Dono-
van during their days at Provi-
dence, and the young point 
guard out of Long Island picked up on his coach’s emphasis on defense. Today, KenPom.com ranks Florida as the second best team in the country in adjusted defense while Pitino’s Louis-ville squad falls just shy at third best.
“I think it’s really impor-
tant,” Donovan said of playing efficient defense. “And . . . cer-tainly the last two years we’ve been exceptional at it, and it’s always been a point of empha-sis for us.”
On the other hand, Alford 
fine-tuned his offensive knowl-
edge while he played under 
Bob Knight at Indiana from 1983 to 1987. As a result, Al-ford’s UCLA team ranks 12th in adjusted offense and 11th in turnover percentage, according to KenPom.com.
“I think Steve is a really, 
really good offensive mind,” 
Donovan said. “I think he does 
a lot of really good, unique things with his team.  I think he puts his guys in situations to be successful.”
In 13 of the Bruins previous 
14 games, Alford has led his of-fense to score at least 74 points during their 11-3 stretch. The 
last time Donovan’s players 
surrendered at least 74 points came on Jan. 11 in the Gators’ overtime victory over the Ar-
kansas Razorbacks. 
The last time Florida gave 
up 74 in regulation? A 77-75 
neutral site win against Mem-phis on Dec. 17.
Whether the Gators con-
tinue their strong defensive stretch Thursday comes down to the play of Scottie Wilbekin — the Southeastern Conference Player of the Year — and Patric Young — SEC Defensive Player of the Year.
Both Wilbekin and Young 
excelled defensively during 
Florida’s 61-45 thumping of Pitt 
in the Round of 32. But with two first-team All-Pac 12 play-ers in Kyle Anderson and Jor-dan Adams on the docket for Donovan’s squad, the Gators will have their hands full in their attempt to reach their fourth straight Elite Eight.
If things go how they did in 
1987 when both Donovan and Alford were seniors at Provi-
dence and Indiana, respective-
ly, then it will be Alford coming away with the last laugh.
Although each former point 
guard led his team to the Final Four, Alford and the Knight-coached Hoosiers advanced and eventually won the nation-al title while Donovan and the Pitino-coached Friars fell just shy of the final game.
But like Donovan has said 
about contests in the past:
“There’s nothing we can 
even take from those past games that you can sit there and say, ‘Wow, there’s a great carryover to getting prepared to play them here on Thursday.’”this season. The sophomores have 
already combined for 12 home runs on the season after hitting only 13 
throughout all of 2013.
“With the two of them, it’s al-
ways been about confidence and 
pitch selection,” Walton said. 
“They’re both perfectly capable 
of hitting the ball out to all parts of the field, and they’ve done it in their careers.”
Florida extended its lead to 10-3 
heading into the bottom of the sixth, and it looked as if UF had the game locked up, but miscues on defense and poor pitching kept UCF in the game.
Freshman Delanie Gourley, who 
needed only 15 pitches to finish off the Knights in the fifth inning, walked two straight batters with full 
counts to start the sixth frame.
UCF leadoff hitter Kahley Novak 
loaded the bases with an infield sin-
gle, Goodman reached first base on a fielder’s choice to score a run.
Sullivan reloaded the bases with 
an infield single, and Mariah Gar-cia drove in two runs with a single down the right field line to bring the Knights within four runs.
But Gourley rebounded in the 
final inning, striking out two of her last three batters in order to pick up her second save of the season and keep the Gators undefeated in non-
conference play.
“We came from behind,” Walton 
said. 
“So that was a huge moment for 
the offense to be able to be down and still scratch and claw their way 
back.”
an upset victory over then-No. 6 Kentucky in 
Lexington, Ky. 
Florida ended its streak against then-No. 12 
LSU in the wake of Mercer’s suspension after she was arrested for conspiracy to commit a robbery, leaving its already depleted roster with only seven players. 
Fortunately, Bannister came back shortly 
after Mercer’s arrest, if only to serve the pur-pose of having another warm body in a Gators uniform. 
Then came the unexpected addition of Pa-
mela Begic, one of UF’s soccer players,  to in-crease the roster back to nine relatively healthy players.
Although she never saw the floor, Begic’s 
height and prior basketball experience were what led Butler to put the midfielder on the roster — not to mention that active players were at a premium entering the home stretch of conference play. 
A few alternating wins and losses later, the 
Gators found themselves fifth in the SEC at season’s end after another upset victory over Kentucky — this time in Gainesville — and a 
signature victory in Vanderbilt. 
After earning a bye to start the SEC Tour-
nament, Florida went 1-1, beating Mississippi State for the second time this season and los-
ing to Kentucky after winning the first two matchups. 
And after slogging through injuries and 
controversy seemingly all season, the Gators were redeemed when they received an invi-tation to the NCAA Tournament, for the first time since 2012 as an 11-seed. 
Naturally, Florida was the underdog in its 
first game against six-seed Dayton, but it still overcame statistics and won the game. 
The season ended two days later against 
host Penn State, but it ended later than every-one thought it would.
Seniors Jaterra Bonds and Lily Svete were 
crutches that kept the Gators from falling. Al-though they had their fair share of missteps, 
Svete and Bonds kept the team afloat, playing 
instrumental roles in many Florida victories — Bonds driving to the lane and Svete shooting her signature three-pointer. 
“Coming from all the things that came up 
during our season, we had great leadership,” redshirt junior Kayla Lewis said. “JT and Lily set the tone in practice during conditioning. They were always the first to do anything. 
They were ready to do whatever needed to be 
done for our program. We just followed be-hind them. 
“When things looked bleak and dark, we 
never wavered because of our leadership.”THURSDAY, MARCH 27, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15

The Gators men’s swimming 
and diving team is No. 1 in the 
country, has the third most NCAA 
qualiﬁ  cations, top-10 times in 14 
out of 18 events and is the favorite to walk away from Austin, Texas, with the NCAA Championships crown. 
But what’s on paper won’t mat-
ter when the racing starts today at the Lee and Joe Jamail Texas Swimming Center as Texas hosts this year’s national championship meet.
Florida is led by its group of se-
niors — Brad deBorde, Marcin Cie-slak and redshirt senior Sebastien Rousseau — who have been the 
leaders of the nation’s best team 
in and out of the pool. And in an atmosphere where experience un-der the big lights goes a long way, these Gators are well-equipped to perform.
“A lot of character on the team, 
and they handle adverse situations pretty well, so I feel real comfort-able that we’re 
going to see great efforts,” coach Gregg Troy said. “How good it is, we won’t know that until af-
ter the meet is 
over.”
Cieslak’s last 
trip to NCAAs was bittersweet.
Although he made the podium 
in all three of his events in 2013, it was three straight silvers for the 18-time All-American as Flor-ida came in a disappointing sixth place. Troy even jokes with him about last year’s trio of runner-up ﬁ  nishes, Cieslak said. He wants this year to be different.
Coming off of his best swims 
this season in the 200-yard indi-vidual medley, 100- and 200-yard 
butterﬂ  y from the Southeastern 
Conference Championships last month, Cieslak enters NCAAs with top-8 national times for each of his three events.
But he isn’t the only swimmer 
looking for his ﬁ  rst individual NCAA title.
Neither deBorde nor Rousseau have won individual gold in their four years of competing at the na-tional meet. 
Rousseau is sitting on the na-
tion’s second-fastest 200-yard ﬂ  y time this season from SECs, and his 200- and 400-yard IM times 
place him sixth in the country.  
DeBorde — UF’s 50-yard free-
style record holder — posted the 
second-fastest time in his signa-ture event at the conference meet, just 0.08 seconds off the national leader.
