Dedicated Gator fans may soon be able to get 
a full view of Ben Hill Griffin Stadium from their 
own balconies.
Construction on Stadium Club, a planned con-
dominium right behind Griffin Stadium, has been 
at a standstill until last year, when Ralph Larry Roberts Sr. of RLR Investments bought the property 
in a foreclosure auction.
The company has stated that it will continue 
building under the original plans, calling for eight 
floors and 24 condo units.
According to Stadium Club’s website, other fea-
tures include a private terrace for each residence and a private parking garage.
Located at 1800 W University Ave., the condo-
minium is marketed to loyal Gator fans because of its location.
According to the website, units on higher floors 
will cost more money than those on the lower floors. 
The condominiums will cost between about 
$400,000 and about $2 million.

Zoo in Ohio looking for prairie dogs, which are currently on the lam
POWELL, Ohio — An Ohio zoo is try-
ing to round up runaway prairie dogs and is 
asking its neighbors for help.
The Columbus Zoo and Aquarium said 
Friday 11 of the critters wriggled their way out of temporary quarters and so far only four have been recovered.
Assistant Curator Jeremy Carpenter says 
in a statement there’s no reason to believe the animals have left zoo property. But he says nearby residents are being asked to watch for prairie dogs, just in case.
The zoo says the animals are not danger -
ous.
They were among a group of 20 prai-
rie dogs that arrived from another zoo in November. The newcomers were kept in quarantine, then moved into the temporary housing two weeks ago. They were to be in-troduced into the zoo’s regular prairie dog exhibit in the spring.

All Delta flights at Gainesville Regional 
Airport going to and from Atlanta were can-
celed due to the harsh weather conditions 
across the southeast Monday.
As of 5 p.m. Monday, six other scheduled 
flights went on as scheduled with only one flight delay to Charlotte, N.C., due to bad 
weather, said Gainesville Regional Airport 
spokeswoman Laura Aguiar. According to the National Weather Ser -
vice, there was a hazardous weather outlook 
Monday with freezing rain and sleet. 
Aguiar believes that everything should be 
back on track today. She suggested that ev-
eryone check his or her flights on the airport website, www.flygainesville.com, before ar -
riving. 
She also said those making 
flights to Atlanta should check with Hartsfield-Jackson Interna-

remembers him as “fun to be 
around no matter what.”
Harmer remembers sitting 
beside Cameron on the couch in their apartment to watch TV shows such as “Family Guy” and “Fringe.” 
The last time the two hung 
out was at the Waldo Farmers and Flea Market where Cam-eron bought the last season of “Fringe.”
Cameron was always up for 
food. 
He loved almost every food, 
except for artichokes.
Whenever he was not in class 
or hanging out with Harmer, Cameron could be found in his room.
He was always working on his 
computer and listening to techno music, Harmer’s girlfriend, Lind-sey Scoates, remembers.
“He was kind of nerdy,” she 
said. “But he was a chill person. … It didn’t matter to us.”
Harmer helped Cameron’s 
mother clean out his room over the weekend. While they were cleaning, 
they both stopped to laugh.
The floor was covered in pizza 
crusts.
“That was so typical of Dante,” 
he said.
Most of all, Scoates remem-
bers Cameron was never down about his heart condition. 
Cameron was always thank-
ful to live with his close circle of friends.
Scoates said her last memory 
of Cameron was sitting on the 
apartment couch next to him 
Thursday. 
She was listening to him talk 
excitedly about the new comput-
er he was building.
The last thing Scoates remem-
bers Cameron saying while she 
and Harmer sat on the couch  was, “One of the best things of 
my life was to meet you guys.”

Until 170,000 years ago, humans hung around Africa in 
their birthday suits.
Then, they put on some clothes and got itchy.
David Reed, associate curator of mammals for the Flor -
ida Museum of Natural History, and his team of research-ers have calculated when humans started wearing clothes by studying the lice that lived on them.
The research, published in January’s “Molecular Bi-
ology and Evolution” and funded in part by a $935,000 award from the National Science Foundation, is open to the public on the Oxford Journal’s website, mbe.oxford-
journals.org.The research states that once humans started wear -
ing clothes, body lice, also called clothing lice, started to 
appear. The clothing decayed over the years, but the lice 
multiplied.
Melissa Toups, co-author of the study and a former UF 
grad student, said being able to use lice to find out infor -
mation that archaeology couldn’t find was cool.
“Using the parasites was pretty innovative,” she said.Just as humans and chimpanzees once shared a com-
mon ancestor, Reed said, head lice and body lice once 
shared a common ancestor as well. Figuring out when they split into two groups was the key to figuring out when humans clothed themselves.
Instead of putting on clothing to keep warm, the re-
search shows that humans started wearing clothing while they were in sunny Africa. Reed said the clothing might have been decorative, such as beaded belts.
When humans emigrated out of Africa and traveled to 
other parts of the world, the lice went with them. 
Reed said his next step is trying to trace the lice’s trav-
els from Europe and Asia to the Americas to find out ex-actly when humans came to the Americas.
“We think the lice will have a story to tell,” he said.Lice help pinpoint when humans first got dressedUF RESEARCH

PALATKA — The woman at home with 
a north Florida girl the night she went missing has been sentenced in an unrelat-ed drug trafficking case.
A Putnam County judge sentenced 
19-year-old Misty Croslin on Monday to 25 years in prison and nearly $1.5 million 
in fines. 
Croslin pleaded no contest last year to 
seven counts of dealing in prescription narcotics. 
She was sentenced to various terms for 
each count, but they will all 
run concurrently with an ear -
lier sentence.
A St. Johns County judge 
sentenced Croslin in October to 25 years in prison for one charge of drug trafficking.
Croslin was watching Haleigh Cum-
mings the night the 5-year-old disappeared in February 2009.

Alligator Staff Writer  
Newell Hall was evacuated Monday af-
ter fire alarms were heard in the building.  
A malfunctioning elevator motor in the build-ing caused smoke, which set off fire alarms in 
the building, according to Keith Saunders, a spokesman for the Gainesville Fire Rescue. 
University Police Department spokesman 
Jeff Holcomb reported that the fire alarms went off at 12:35 p.m. 
Manmeet Waria, a Ph.D. candidate in soil 
and water sciences, said fire trucks arrived at 
the scene about 10 minutes after the alarms went off. 
The two fire trucks that arrived at the 
scene parked at the Hub and evaluated the 
situation before leaving around 1:05 p.m. 
There were no reports of the 
elevator being stuck or anyone 
trapped inside as the elevator malfunctioned, Saunders said.“We have seen that elevator break two or 
three times before,” Waria said. “So, my re-
action was that the elevator broke and there was no real fire. But, you never know.”
This isn’t the first time the building has 
been evacuated in the past two years. An identical incident involving smoke created by an elevator motor occurred at Newell Hall 
on Sept. 1.Smoking elevator causes evacuation of Newell Hall

PHOENIX — Throngs of reporters waited hours Mon-
day to get their first look at the mysterious man accused 
of a deadly shooting rampage that left Rep. Gabrielle Gif-
fords critically wounded.
When the doors finally opened to U.S. Magistrate Law-
rence Anderson’s chambers, there was a mad rush for the 
wooden benches. 
Reporters elbowed their way past courtroom artists 
clutching their sketch pads, law clerks and more than a dozen stern-looking U.S. marshals. One man was kicked out after he touched an electronic device he was holding.
The room buzzed with whispered conversations.Then Jared Loughner walked into the room. Every-
thing fell silent.
Wearing a tan prison uniform and handcuffs, the 
22-year-old looked vacantly toward the 
back of the packed courtroom; his deep-
set eyes seemed unfocused. 
A pink gash stood out from the hair -
line of his shaved head.
He paused for a moment, then turned 
and sat down next to his lawyer, Judy Clarke, who whispered in his ear.
Loughner stood up when the judge 
entered the chambers. The suspect walked to the podium. 
Anderson explained that Loughner could face life impris-onment or the death penalty for the killings of a federal 
judge and a Giffords staffer, and for the attempted assassi-nation of Giffords, who was shot in the head. Four others also died and more were wounded; Loughner will likely 
be charged with those crimes in state courts.
The judge told Loughner his rights, including the right 
to remain silent, and asked him if he understood.
Loughner — who has not been cooperating with inves-
tigators — leaned forward and said loudly: “Yes.”
As Loughner left the podium, his lawyer placed her 
hand on his back. 
They walked toward the door, where a marshal 
grabbed Loughner’s right arm and marched him out of the chambers.Frenzy surrounds Arizona shooting suspect’s hearing

Today’s question: Do politics 
have a place in college football?
52 TOTAL VOTES42% YES58% NOMonday’s question: Are you participating in Dance Marathon?Costly inauguration not unique to Scott
A lot of people have been slagging Gov. Rick Scott 
for his extravagant inauguration festivities last Tuesday. 
They say he’s out of touch with the sensibilities of 
the average Floridian who is struggling in the lean tour -
ist economy we’re now forced to survive in. 
They say Rick Scott’s “coronation” festivities were an 
example of the kind of fiscal irresponsibility we can ex-pect from the shiny-domed man who is now our state’s executive. 
To all the people making these claims I say, “right 
on.”
I mean, who could not be cross with a man for spend-
ing $3 million on his own victory celebration?
The obvious question is: Why didn’t he spend 
more?
If Gov. Scott knew absolutely anything about the 
needs and desires of the people, he would know opu-lence is the way to the heart of the proletariat. 
As any good community organizer knows, the only 
way to win the respect of the people is to put on a show 
big enough and flashy enough to dazzle the small minds 
of the working class long enough for them to forget we’re in a depression. 
Perhaps Gov. Scott should have taken notes from the 
great unifier, our president, Barack Obama. 
Dwarfing Scott’s measly $3 million, Obama’s inau-
guration cost a stately $170 million, according to ABC News. 
Now here’s a guy who really knows how to throw 
a party. 
Not only did Obama use private funds for this little 
soiree, he used about $120 million of federal funds to make sure this shindig was spe-cial.
This probably included both 
the diamond-studded crown he specifically required after claim-ing that he was “king of America,” and the fact that he made sure that 
the party was planned by Corey 
Worthington. 
It’s really not even that much money when you take 
out all of the necessary costs.
Consider, for instance, the matching leather jackets 
he ordered for all the czars. 
Then there’s the bark collar he got for Hillary Clin-
ton. 
Some things you simply can’t do without.
Considering President Obama ran on a ticket of con-
nection with the common man and concern for the fi-
nancial situation of the country when he took office, I can only assume this is how you communicate that you know what you’re doing and have the best interests of 
the people in mind.
With that noted, I hope Rick Scott has the time to 
really reconsider his whole direction in his upcoming 
governorship. 
He needs to shape up and realize that this opulence 
and luxury correspond to responsibility and sensitivity.
If not, he’s in for a rough term. He didn’t even use any state money for his party. That’s bad form. 
If we can’t expect our elites to spend our money un-
wisely, who can we trust?

Immigration bill needs   
a rewrite
“I might not even vote for it myself.”
Apparently , the captain’s going down with the ship. 
As one of the leading proponents of Florida’s Arizona-
style immigration bill, state Sen. Mike Bennett admitted his 
measure probably won’t pass through the Florida Legislature 
as it stands. Even he saw how the language borrowed from Ari-
zona’s controversial law could cause problems. 
Just what constitutes the “reasonable suspicion” a police of-
ficer would need to check someone’s immigration status during a routine traffic stop?
Gov. Rick Scott has denied any tie between the measure and 
discrimination, but it may be an unspoken corollary to the cur -
rent bill. And while the bill’s sitting pretty in the Florida House, that’s a risk the state Senate may be unwilling to take. We’re 
glad.
While we understand why voters like the idea of an immi-
gration bill, a mere antidiscrimination clause isn’t going to stop 
stereotypes from being a factor. Besides, the state does not yet have an accurate way to quickly determine who’s here legally.
Still, Sen. Bennett said the bill is not a complete waste be-
cause he’s using it to open a discussion on the issue. 
Here’s our contribution to the conversation: When the state 
has an accurate way to check everyone without a cop making a 
call based on an accent or skin color, we’ll give our blessing.
Full of Fili-Bluster
Picture this scene. It’s an 
ungodly hot September day and our Florida 
Gators football team take the field to deliver their tradi-
tional, early-season Charles 
Sumner-style canning of a non-conference powerhouse St. Cecilia’s School of the Blind and Anorexic. 
The score is being run up 
faster than your blood alco-hol content at that 9 a.m. pre-game, and you are starting to 
believe this 2011 Gators team 
could actually be destined for a bowl not named after a search engine website or fast-food chain. 
Our quarterback (insert ei-
ther Brantley/Reed/Burton/Driskel or Uncle Rico) chucks a long bomb toward the end 
zone. Can you see it? (Try to 
think back before this year.) The ball looks like it’s about to connect. TOUCHDO--
Wait a minute, what’s this? 
It’s two Justice Department officials dropped from F-16 jets, halting the game to de-liver an executive order call-
ing for a congressional fact-
finding inquiry into whether such a play is constitutional. A Senate panel has published a 1,000-page report that un-covers whether there is any indication the Founding Fa-thers would have wanted a stadium with a blue field. 
Ridiculous? Perhaps a bit. 
But so is our best and bright-est in Washington trying to get involved in the Bowl Championship Series system. In Washington state, a group of attorneys have launched a political action committee, “Playoff PAC,” with the goal to kill the BCS machine. The 
Senate felt it necessary to hold 
hearings. Even our command-er-in-chief vowed to “throw his weight around a little bit” on the issue. Really?
With a country currently 
languishing under the weight of two multi-billion-dollar wars and an unforgiving 
economy, we feel that try-
ing to salvage a college post-season formula that is more broken than a Larry King marriage shouldn’t be the top priority. It’s good for politi-cians to show they care about “regular-folk” topics, but let’s try to tackle some key issues 
instead of righting the wrongs 
of Utah and Boise State.

Alligator should have offered coverage 
of Arizona shooting
The Alligator seems to have 
lost its way as a news source.  
Monday’s edition devoted the entire edi-
torial column to criticizing the media re-
sponse to the tragic shooting of Rep. Ga-brielle Giffords, but not a single column inch to covering the shooting itself.
Not once did the paper name the 
shooter, allegedly Jared Lee Loughner, or the six people killed, including federal judge John Roll and  9-year-old Christina Green, or the 13 others wounded. 
While editorial commentary is a core 
media function, simply reporting the news is absolutely essential.
The Alligator is a key news source for 
many students, and this failure to report the news is a betrayal of readers’ trust.

Reader’s proposal for forced abortions 
not so modest
While Chad Kimes’ vision for a brave 
new world certainly is breathtaking, his 
call for “forced abortions” is not a modest 
proposal.
Instead of proposing, “Who should not 
have children?” (China’s policy last time 
I checked), he proposes, “Whose children 
should we kill?”
The first “targets” are “obviously those 
who oppose the policy,” Kimes writes. 
What do the supporters get? 
A complimentary vasectomy?
I would rather listen to the same silly 
arguments until I die before coming to 
that.

When President Ronald Reagan was shot in March 
of 1981 he told his surgeon, Dr. Joseph Giordano, a Democrat, “Please tell me you’re all Republicans,” 
and he responded, “Today, Mr. President, we’re all Repub-licans.”
I first heard about the shooting of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords 
through Facebook. At the time there were very few hard 
facts. Most of the early reports said that she was killed and 
about 13 others were wounded.
The facts were: Rep. Giffords was shot, along with sev-
eral other people; it was at an event she hosted regularly called “Congress on Your Corner” where she would meet 
with constituents on an individual basis; and Giffords is a 
Democrat.
In our instantly-updated, mobile, multitasking, we’re-
all-experts-on-everything world, that last fact meant only 
one thing on Twitter: the shooter must be a right-wing, tea 
party extremist. This conclusion was reached very quickly, without any evidence, without even knowing the shooter’s name. Even as every political figure from every part of the spectrum made their support and prayers for her recovery 
known, the unempirical, two-fact based hypothesis on the 
politics and personality of the shooter became a “fact” of its own on social networks.
Remember, the shooter didn’t even have a name at this 
point.
Eventually the Associated Press found it out: Jared 
Loughner, or, in keeping with the determination that assas-sins must have three names: Jared Lee Loughner.
The YouTube channel that may belong to him is odd, to 
say the least. In his videos he talks about the importance of grammar and literacy — in borderline-incoherent run-on sentences; he wants to run a business around “conscience dreaming”; and he wants to start a new system of currency. 
His list of favorite books included Orwell’s “1984,” Huxley’s 
“Brave New World,” Bradbury’s “Farenheit 451,” “Mein Kampf” and “The Communist Manifesto.”
Not only does this list show him as more complex than a 
political slogan, but it begs the question of how Twitter users in say, Tennessee or Illinois can draw conclusions based on only a few facts. There really isn’t an easy way to say this, except to say it: we are all suffering from a delusion where 
we make all the facts we learn try to fit in to our conception 
of how the world works.
No one wants people to be shot at, but if people are shot 
and killed, on some level we want the shooter to be some-thing Other. So Jane Fonda blames Glenn Beck, Sarah Pa-lin and Michele Bachmann for Loughner’s actions; conserva-tives say he’s insane, or retweet 
the remarks of Caitie Parker, 
who knew him in 2007: “As I knew him he was left wing, 
quite liberal. & oddly obsessed with the 2012 prophecy.”
I’m not immune to it, either: I worry about Loughner’s 
apparent support for the gold standard — something heav-ily associated with my brand of libertarian politics and so I take issue with what I hope was a facetious tweet by blogger Matt Yglesias: “Loughner YouTube indicates the thin line between utter insanity and gold standard advocates.”
So I say thank God for Rachel Maddow, who tweeted 
“There is nothing to be gained from speculating on the mo-tives and affiliations of AZ shooter w/o facts.”
As I write this at 7:40 p.m. on the day of the shooting, there 
still aren’t many more facts than there were right afterward. We know here in Amherst that Loughner is in custody; that Giffords’ office was vandalized last year; that federal Judge John Roll, who was also killed, received death threats in the past; and counting Roll, six people were murdered.
The flow of rumor has yet to be staunched. In addition 
to the “Loughner is a Tea Partier” “hypothesis,” a number of people on Twitter were saying that if he was a Muslim he would be called a terrorist, but since he’s white he’s “in-
sane.” Some people are calling Loughner a terrorist: Tea Par -
ty Nation founder Judson Phillips said in an e-mail posted 
on The New York Times’ “The Caucus” blog, “The shooter has been taken into custody and let’s hope he gets the death penalty he so richly deserves . . . No one should be a victim 
of violence because of their political beliefs . . . we can all be 
happy that the Congresswoman survived this terrorist at-tack.”
In a time of extreme uncertainty like this it is important 
not to latch on to unfounded rumors coming out of Twitter or Facebook, but to remember our reason and concentrate on the facts. Let the unknowns be unknown instead of pretend-
ing to know. As a journalist I’m acutely aware that things 
can be misreported or misunderstood, but that doesn’t mean we should make things up wholesale, either.
The day of the shooting we all should have been Demo-
crats, but the way we’ve been trying to pass off Loughner as 
coming from the opposite side of the political spectrum as 
our own says more distrurbing things about us than any of his YouTube videos say about him.

n THE LAWSUIT CLAIMS THE 
MINIMUM WAGE SHOULD RISE TO $7.31 AN HOUR.
ASSOCIATED PRESS
TALLAHASSEE — Two legal 
groups sued Florida’s labor agency 
Monday, claiming the state failed to raise the state’s minimum wage by 
six cents per hour this year to keep 
up with inflation.
The lawsuit claimed the Agency 
for Workforce Innovation violated the Florida Constitution by keeping it at the $7.25 federal rate, where it was last year, instead of raising it to $7.31 on Jan. 1.
About 188,000 minimum wage 
workers could be effected. At stake is up to $128 this year for a full-time employee working a 40-hour week. If all those the minimum-wage em-ployees worked 40-hour weeks the extra six cents would add up to $15 
million.
“Unlike higher wage-earners, 
those at the lowest end of the scale 
tend to spend rather than put away additional earnings, meaning that 
any added income goes directly into Florida’s economy,” Jose Javier 
Rodriguez of Florida Legal Services said in a statement. “This is not a partisan or political issue. When it comes to our prosperity, it’s a ‘no-brainer.’”
His organization and the Na-
tional Employment Law Project 
filed the lawsuit on behalf of four 
individual workers and three orga-nizations that represent low-wage employees: the Restaurant Oppor -
tunities Center of Miami, WeCount! in Homestead and the Farmworker Association of Florida in Apopka.
Agency spokesman Robby Cun-
ningham said in a statement that the complaint had been received and was be-
ing reviewed.
The suit noted seven other states 
with similar laws increased their 
minimum wages on New Year’s 
Day. They are Arizona, Colorado, 
Ohio, Montana, Oregon, Vermont 
and Washington.
The state Supreme Court said in 
an advisory opinion that Florida’s constitutional amendment, which passed in 2004, does not provide for decreases in minimum wage be-cause of deflation.
Yet, the suit alleges, the agency 
cut the minimum wage in 2010 to $7.06 an hour from the previous year’s $7.21 and failed to publicly 
announce its calculations as re-
quired by law.
Florida workers avoided the re-
duction because Congress passed a 
minimum wage law requiring $7.25 per hour.
The suit alleges the agency mis-
calculated the rate this year as $7.16 per hour, still below the federal 
minimum, based on its erroneous 
$7.06 rate last year. The plaintiffs contend the agency instead should have calculated this year’s state minimum wage off the 2009 state rate.
They said the agency’s internal 
memos acknowledged the Supreme 
Court’s ruling and expressed wor -
ries that a decrease would be ille-gal.
Florida’s rates are based on an-
nual changes in the non-seasonally 
adjusted Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers in the southern region.Florida sued for failing to adjust 
minimum wage after inflation

n THE CORNERBACK FIRST POSTED 
HIS DECISION ON TWITTER.
By ANTHONY CHIANG

Will Muschamp has made some big moves 
in his short time as Florida’s coach, but Mon-day may have been his best day yet.
Cornerback Janoris Jenkins decided to 
return for his senior season, UF announced Monday morning, despite being projected as a first-round pick in the 2011 NFL Draft by most analysts.
“After careful consideration, I’ve made 
a decision to return to school for my senior year,” Jenkins said in a statement.
“I spent some time with my family and 
coach (Will) Muschamp and came to the con-clusion it was in my best interest to return to school. Coach Muschamp was very support-ive throughout the whole process, regardless of my decision, but he wanted to make sure I had all of the facts. I’m looking forward to working toward my degree, completing my rehab and getting back on the field with my teammates.”
Jenkins first made his intention known Sun-

Junior cornerback Janoris Jenkins announced Monday his decision to return to Florida for his senior season. Jenkins was projected to be a first-round pick in the NFL Draft, but he opted to come back after consulting his family and coach Will Muschamp.
Jenkins officially returning to Florida for senior season

Somewhere between a relaxing Christ-
mas break and a personal meeting with 
his coaches, something clicked for Patric Young. 
The freshman center, who has under -
performed based on his lofty preseason expectations, returned to Gainesville with a renewed focus and commitment, and the results have been noteworthy. 
With nagging injuries threatening to 
limit Vernon Macklin’s minutes, the de-velopment of Young could be crucial as Florida (12-3, 1-0 Southeastern Confer -
ence) traverses the grind of SEC play, which continues tonight at 9 in Knoxville against Tennessee (10-5, 0-1 SEC).
“I feel like I’m learning a lot,” Young 
said. “I’m trusting the coaches a lot more and buying into what they’ve been tell-ing me, and it’s been showing the last few games.”
In UF’s three games since the holiday 
break, Young has averaged 4.3 points and 4.7 rebounds in 18.3 minutes per game. 
While those numbers appear mod-
est, they are nearly two points and two rebounds per game higher than what 
Young averaged in the team’s first 12 games, when he played 14.3 minutes per contest. 
“I think he came 
back and realized this is going to be a process 
for him,” coach Billy Donovan said last week. “He’s really tried to focus on doing the things that he knows he can do.”
When Young arrived on campus, 
many assumed the 6-foot-9, 245-pound freshman would immediately provide the post presence the Gators lacked in years past. 
Those without a close connection to Young finding his wayGators’ hit-or-miss outside 
shooting not key to season
Let’s get one thing out of the way 
right now: Florida is not a consis-tently good outside shooting team.
We learned it last year, when the Gators 
shot 31.3 percent from three-point range 
but made 50.5 percent of their other field 
goal attempts en route to an overachiev-ing NCAA Tournament appearance.
We have once again seen them struggle 
from long range this season, as UF is con-necting on 34.4 percent of its shots from beyond the arc but making 51.9 percent of the rest of its shots. 
Sure, the Gators will enjoy nights when 
Kenny Boynton, Erving Walker or Chan-dler Parsons catch fire and light it up from long range. But after a season and a half of watching the same core group of play-ers, it’s safe to say great outside shooting is not in this team’s DNA.
The constant with this year’s squad — 
and it was true last season, too — is that Florida can lose on any given night be-
cause of its poor shooting but can also win 
on any given night because of its defense. 
Florida coach Billy Donovan has pub-
licly deflected attention from his team’s on-and-mostly-off outside shooting since last year, in-stead focusing on the things they can 
control. 
As aggravat-
ing as it might be 
to hear Donovan ignore criticism of his squad’s shoot-ing, it has proven 
to be the right approach with his players.
“That’s the main thing coach Dono-
van said: Worry about defense, and ev-erything else will come,” senior center V ernon Macklin said. “We can’t control that, really, and that’s been working out for us.”
The players often say their shoot-
ing struggles are between their ears, and Donovan has sought to remedy that by putting the focus elsewhere. 
An unexpected byproduct of that 
mentality has been, ironically , improved shooting. The Gators have hit 46.3 percent

Auburn’s Cam Newton throws a pass during the ﬁ  rst half of the 
BCS National Championship Game on Monday in Glendale, Ariz. 
 THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
    
 GLENDALE, Ariz. — Wes By-
rum kicked a 19-yard ﬁ  eld goal as 
time expired, and No. 1 Auburn beat No. 2 Oregon 22-19 to win the BCS national championship Mon-day night.
  Oregon had tied it at 19 with 2:33 
left when Darron Thomas connected with Jeff Maehl on a tying two-point conversion after LaMichael James scored on a shovel pass.
  Heisman Trophy winner Cam 
Newton and Auburn came right back with a 73-yard drive, with freshman Michael Dyer making the key plays. First, he rolled over an Oregon tackler and, with most of the players thinking the play was over around midﬁ  eld, scooted an-other 30 yards to the 23.
  A play later, Dyer went through 
the middle for 16 to the 1.
  After Newton was pushed back a 
yard, Byrum came on with two sec-onds left to kick the winner and give Auburn its ﬁ  rst national champion-ship since 1957 and the Southeast-ern Conference’s ﬁ  fth in a row.
  Newton’s passing and a goal line 
stand helped Auburn build a 19-11 lead over Oregon after three quar-ters. The former Florida quarterback threw two touchdown passes in the second quarter, and Nick Fairley and the Auburn defense made the biggest play in the third quarter at the University of Phoenix Stadium.
  Auburn led 16-11 at halftime as 
the Tigers rolled up 258 yards in the second and picked up right where 
they left off at the start of the third.
  The Tigers drove into the red 
zone, but stalled and settled for By-
rum’s 28-yard ﬁ  eld goal to make it 19-11.
  Oregon had its best chance to 
score on its second possession of the third quarter, using a fake punt in its own territory to keep the ball and a 43-yard pass from Darron Thomas 
to Lavasier Tuinei, who made a jug-
gling catch, to get down to the Au-
burn 3.
  The ﬁ  rst Oregon run went back-
wards, but the next two left Oregon 
at the 1 facing 
fourth down.
  T h o m a s 
handed to Ken-
jon Barner, but he didn’t get close to the goal line, with a throng of Au-
burn defenders stacking him up for no gain.
  Oregon started the scoring with 
a 26-yard ﬁ  eld goal by Rob Beard on 
the second play of the second quar-
ter, then Newton and the Tigers put together their ﬁ  rst sustained drive to take the lead.
  Newton gave a slight pump-
fake to freeze a defender and hit Kodi Burns in the middle of the ﬁ  eld. Burns, the former quarterback bumped to receiver when Newton arrived before this season, leaped into the end zone for a 35-yard score and a 7-3 lead with 12:00 left in the second quarter.
  The Ducks struck right back. 
Backed up to his own 7, Thomas sailed a deep ball down the middle for Maehl, who went 81 yards to the Auburn 12. It was the longest play 
from scrimmage in the 13-year his-
tory of the BCS championship game 
and the Ducks’ ninth play this sea-son of more than 60 yards.
  Three plays later, Thomas 
hooked up with James, the nation’s 
leading rusher, on a screen pass that 
worked to perfection for an 8-yard touchdown. Instead of kicking the extra point, Oregon faked it with 
holder Jackson Rice pitching to kick-
er Beard, who dived in for the two-
point conversion to make it 11-7. 
  The four-play, 93-yard drive took 
all of 57 seconds, typical for the fast-
paced Ducks.
  Auburn marched right back 
down, going 68 yards in 15 plays be-
fore facing fourth-and-goal at the 1.
  Coach Gene Chizik went for it, 
stacking the backﬁ  eld with potential blockers for his 250-pound quarter-back. But Newton faked the run and ﬂ  oated a pass to running back Eric 
Smith, who was open in the end 
zone. 
The pass was a bit short and 
Smith let it slip through his arms to 
the turf as he slipped down. 
Auburn wins national title on last-second ﬁ  eld goal
16, ALLIGATOR n TUESDAY, JANUARY 11, 2011
name posted, “Gator Nation I’m back...” 
That tweet was confirmed to be accurate early Monday morning.
The rising senior, who was ranked by 
ESPN draft expert Todd McShay as the No. 11 overall player in this year’s draft class, will return to a young secondary that will need to replace strong safety Ah-mad Black, who led the team with five in-terceptions this season, and possibly free safety Will Hill, who is rumored to be leaning toward entering the NFL Draft.
Jenkins will be expected to help an-
chor a defense under the instruction of new UF defensive coordinator Dan Quinn, who has coached in the NFL for 10 seasons.
“I’m excited that Janoris has made a 
decision to come back to school,” Mus-champ said. “I would have supported him in whatever decision he made, but I commend him for making a mature de-cision. It would have been real easy for Janoris to make an emotional choice and leave early, but with our contacts in the NFL, we were able to assist him in under -
standing his draft status and he made an educated decision that will be beneficial to him in the long term.”
This season, Jenkins played in all 12 of 
UF’s regular-season games before miss-ing the Gators’ matchup against Penn State in the Outback Bowl after undergo-ing shoulder surgery .

with a torn labrum, and he can now re-hab the injury before next season.Returning CB

of their three-point attempts in the last three 
games, all of which have been impressive wins.
“You miss a shot, and now all of a sud-
den, you’re living in that play . And you 
come down the floor on the next play , and 
it affects something else. Now, that play has beat you twice,” Donovan said. “You have to have a short-term memory in competi-tion. You’ve got to be able to move forward to the next play.”
While the lingering effects of poor shoot-
ing have often been detrimental to the team, the worst thing that can happen to Florida is actually believing it has become a great shooting team. 
There’s a difference between shooting 
with confidence, as Donovan encourages, and thinking they are capable of outshoot-ing teams.
That has happened at times the past two 
years, most memorably at Vanderbilt last season and against then-No. 4 Ohio State on Nov. 16. In each of those contests, UF gave up more than 90 points — the only times that has happened in regulation the last two 
seasons.
“There’s no question when the ball goes 
in the basket, that helps,” Donovan said. 
“But it can’t get to the point that if we’re not shooting the ball well, it bleeds into and af-fects the other things that they’re doing on the floor.”
Let’s get one more thing out of the way: 
Florida might not be able to shoot, and it 
might not actually matter.
ADAM , from page 14Meeting with Donovan, assistants proves beneficial
the team assumed he would have no difficulty adjusting to the 
physicality of the college game and that he would provide a low-post scoring presence right off the bat, regardless of the fact that he was making a major jump in competition and was never a scoring threat in high school. 
 “I think there was a frustration point for Patric going 
through November and into the month of December where he wanted to do so well so bad that he got down on himself,” Donovan said. “He got frustrated with himself, and it really led to him not getting better at the rate that he needed to get better, and his attitude was really preventing that.”
Young admits his mindset wasn’t always what he needed 
it to be, and he was guilty of listening to the wrong people on many occasions. 
He also acknowledges that all of the hype and expectations 
surrounding the start of his career got to his head and made 
things more difficult than they needed to be. 
“(I was) putting a lot of pressure on myself to perform, 
which is probably the worst thing I could do,” Young said. 
All that began to change when Young met with Donovan 
and assistant coaches Larry Shyatt and Rob Lanier to discuss 
his development. 
The coaches seemed to sense something was wrong with 
the freshman, prompting them to request a private meeting to converse about Young’s attitude, outlook and goals going forward. 
“They just helped me, talked me through it,” Young said. 
“We were in there for a while, just (discussing) what I need to do and what I should focus on, trying to keep the game simple for me.”
If Young can continue to approach his opportunities with 
the right attitude and commitment, Donovan believes he can 
find a prominent and consistent role in the Florida lineup. 
“He can rebound, he can defend, he can be physical,” Dono-
van said. “As long as he continues to do those things, he’s go-
ing to help our team.”HOOPS , from page 14 What To Watch For
1. Which Tennessee team will show up?
The Volunteers have been wildly inconsistent all season, scor -
ing victories over powerhouses Pittsburgh and Villanova just days 
before falling to Oakland and Charlotte in consecutive games. The Gators enter tonight’s game prepared for the worst, having studied game film from Pitt and Nova, when the Volunteers shot 50.5 percent from the field and 48.1 percent from three-point range.
2. Playing without Pearl
Tonight will be the Volunteers’ second game without coach 
Bruce Pearl on the sideline as he serves his eight-game suspen -
sion for violating NCAA regulations and misleading investigators. 
In the first contest without him, UT dropped its SEC opener 68-65 to Arkansas. The Volunteers’ teamwork suffered without their leader on the bench, as they recorded only 11 assists against 18 turnovers. Florida coach Billy Donovan downplayed the ef -
fect losing Pearl would have, as the Tennessee staff has been together for some time. Still, senior Vernon Macklin said it would be “pretty tough,” while freshman center Patric Young said he “couldn’t imagine that.”
3. Defending the Volunteers
UT junior guard Scotty Hopson and freshman forward Tobias 
Harris are each averaging more than 15 points per game and 
have demonstrated their ability to score from anywhere on the floor. Donovan noted that the Volunteers are as deep and well-rounded as any team the Gators will play this year, with the ability to bring long, athletic players off the bench and score from the paint and the perimeter. “They’re a team that presents a lot of different challenges for you on the defensive end of the floor,” Donovan said.
4. Winning at Thompson-Boling Arena
The Gators haven’t won a game in Knoxville since Feb. 12, 
2005, when they notched an 84-73 victory. The team dropped 
last year’s road contest 61-60. Donovan noted that a key in road games is to take care of the ball and limit turnovers, which will be especially difficult against a strong UT defense known for its length, quickness and athleticism.
