Fair celebrates 40th birthday with makeover
J THE FAIR WILL RUN UNTIL NOV. 1;
OKTOBERFEST RETURNS OCT. 30.
By OLGA VALEZ
Alligator Contributing Writer
The Alachua County Fair is celebrating its
40th birthday with a mid-life crisis.
But instead of getting a fast new car, the
fair has added new food, rides and an Okto-
berfest celebration.
"We wanted to do something different for
everybody," said Henry Suminsky, who has
been working at the fair since 1985. "Every
year, we are looking for new blood and new
ideas. Some of us have been doing this for so
long it's like, 'OK, how do we change next
year?'"
Adding chocolate was the first step, in-
cluding chocolate-covered kettle corn, bacon,
hot dogs and pickles.
The fair also added more rides for chil-
dren.
"We are trying to get back to good old
family ratings," Suminsky said. "Everything
is G-rated out here. Anything above that, we
want to know about it, so we can stop it."
Fair goer Matthew Perez's 5-year-old
granddaughter Seairra's blue eyes lit up
when she rode the Crazy Bus.

Andrew Stanfill Alligator Staff said.

Safety zones double at UF-GA
Some of UF's administrators will be at The
Jacksonville Landing with partygoers during UF-
Georgia festivities this weekend, but they probably
won't be drinking cocktails.
Instead, they'll be manning the safety areas in
the fourth annual Sideline Student Safety Zone in
downtown Jacksonville.
The areas offer fans from both sides a refuge
from the crowds, providing medical treatment,
water, snacks, cell phone chargers and other assis-
tance.
This year, the number of safety zones will double
to six. Also, Jacksonville will be picking up the bulk
of the tab this year. Last year UF and Jacksonville
split the costs.
UF spent about $11,000 last year on hotel rooms
for volunteers and overtime pay for University Po-
lice Department officers, among other expenses.
Also, as part of an agreement between UF and
0 UF quarterback
Tim Tebow (right)
has turned the ball
aver eight times
this season, putting
him on pace for
M6-the same
amount he had in
his first three years
combined.
See Story, Page 13.Jacksonville, there will be 25 percent more police of-
ficers stationed at the Landing this year, said David
Bowles, director of UF's Recreational Sports.
The agreement stems from
safety concerns expressed in a let-
ter from UF President Bernie Ma-
chen to Jacksonville Mayor John
Peyton.
The safety areas, which will
be open on Friday and Saturday,
were created after student deaths
in 2004 and 2005. One student fell
from a parking garage and anoth-
er was beaten to death after he became separated
from his friends.
Bowles said one of the most important functions
of the safety areas is to help intoxicated people who,
in some cases, can't even operate their cell phones.

Vegan week salutes
animal-free lifestyle
0 GO VEGAN WEEK RUNS
FROM OCT. 25 TO OCT. 31.
By JARED MISNER
Alligator Writer
UF and the rest of the world is
celebrating World Go Vegan Week
from Oct. 25 to Oct. 31.
Created by the animal rights
organization In Defense of Ani-
mals four years ago as a global ef-
fort to promote plant-based diets,
World Go Vegan Week has events
throughout the week ranging from
vegan costume parties in San Fran-
cisco to educational events in Bo-
livia.
UF's environmental vegetarian
group, enVeg, plans to sponsor
several events to celebrate World
Go Vegan Week, including a pre-
sentation Wednesday night by
Brendan Brazier, a vegan triathlete
and author, followed by a Hallow-
een-themed vegan potluck Satur-
day afternoon."You don't need to be vegan to
be part of the movement," said El-
len Martin, secretary of enVeg.
EnVeg also brought Bruce
Friedrich, vice president of policy
and government affairs for People
for the Ethical Treatment of Ani-
mals, to UF's campus Saturday to
kickoff World Go Vegan Week.
"You don't need to be
vegan to be part of the
movement."
Ellen Martin
secretary of enVeg
Martin pointed out the positives
of a vegan lifestyle and said World
Go Vegan is a fun opportunity to
educate the community on plant-
based diets.
"I think people should view Go
Veg Week as their own little holi-
day," she said.

Go Vegan Week visit worldgoveg-

Health care discussion turns to uninsured students
9.4 percent of UF students don't have health insurance
By JILLIAN KREMER
Alligator Contributing Writer
Brianne Umhoefer hasn't had health insur-
ance since she was 13. She was covered by
Florida KidCare, a federal program, and then
-suddenly -she wasn't.
"My mom just never got me back on, I
guess," she said.
Umhoefer, a UF sophomore, is just one ofthe many students without health insurance.
Insurance for college students was not
addressed in the health care bill that was ap-
proved by the Senate Finance Committee on
Oct. 13.
Umhoefer said even the lower-cost plan
offered by the health care center costs too
much for her.
She said the last time she visited a doctor
was a year and a half ago because she rarelygets sick.
"But I will definitely be getting it when I'm
out of school, doing my thing," she said.
About 9.4 percent of UFStudent students don't have health in-Life surance, according to the 2008
Healthy Gators Student Survey
Report.
Student Health Care Center director Dr.
Phillip Barkley said there have been concernswith the lack of opportunities for universi-
ties to provide health care as the bill starts to
emerge.
But Barkley, who is the former president
of the American College Health Association,
said members from the organization met with
the finance committee to voice their opinions.
"We are now cautiously optimistic that the
issue will be resolved," he said.
Bruce Vogel, an associate professor in the
department of epidemiology and health pol-
icy research at UF, said students have never
been a high priority for legislators.

UF RESEARCH
Professor, grad student create oyster safety test
By ASHLYN POWELL
Alligator Contributing Writer
UF professor Anita Wright and graduate
student Mark Campbell have developed a
new test that detects oysters that will make
people sick.
The polymerase chain reaction test was
approved at the Interstate Shellfish Sani-
tation Conference in Manchester, N.H.,which took place the week of Oct. 17.
The test will allow the shellfish industry
to comply with FDA's newest safety regu-
lations, announced earlier this month, that
stress that oysters harvested in the Gulf
of Mexico in the summer should receive
treatment to reduce harmful oysters. The
regulations will make it more difficult for
oyster-lovers to find oysters in the U.S.
The test detects Vibrio vulnificus, a spe-
cies that causes the most seafood-relatedfatalities in the U.S.
The test amplifies the
DNA of pathogens so
that researchers can keepI a track of them in oyster
samples.
It can be done in less
than 24 hours and is more
Wright effective and precise than
the current protocol, which can take days
to complete.Although the new discovery can increase
public safety, the shellfish industry must
cope with new problems, Wright said.
"The idea is to improve safety, but the
problem is that it will make oysters less
available," she said. "Not all companies
can afford to do all of these treatments."
Florida Sea Grant is funding the UF re-
searchers to further refine the test and to
provide training and education for the new
method.
TOMS Shoes CEO
to speak Nov. 4
Blake Mycoskie, founder of TOMS Shoes, will speak at
UF on Nov. 4.
Mycoskie's company is known for its One for One cam-
paign, under which it donates one pair of shoes to a child
in need for every pair of shoes purchased from the com-
pany.
So far, the company has donated about 150,000 pairs of
shoes and plans to donate another 300,000 in 2009, accord-
ing to its Web site.
Mycoskie will speak at 8 p.m. at the Phil-On lips Center for the Performing Arts. TheCampus speech will be free and open to the public.
The event is sponsored by Accent, the
Center for Leadership and Service and the UF Office of
Sustainability, among others.
Tickets are available at the Phillips Center box office
and the Constans Theatre box office on the Reitz Union
Colonnade.
The speech caps off a week of TOMS-related events,
including a TOMS documentary being shown at the Reitz
Union Auditorium on Wednesday and a Style Your Sole
Event on the Reitz Union Colonnade on Nov. 3. where
students can decorate a pair of TOMS shoes. Shoes will be
for sale at the event, or students can bring their own.

heindependentfloridaIFacelift includes new rides, Oktoberfest
FAIR, from page 1
still plenty of rides and attrac-
tions for adults, Suminsky said.
One adult-oriented event
new to this year is Oktoberfest, a
German-themed celebration that
took place Saturday from 12 p.m.
to 12 a.m. and will return on Hal-
loween.
The center pole of the 60-by-
60-foot tent that houses the Ok-
toberfest section is surrounded
by four flat-screen TVs playing
football games.
Kendra Hill, who was in charge
of organizing Oktoberfest, said
this was added to attract people
who wouldn't come to the fair on
a Saturday because they wanted
to watch a football game.
"It is to attract anyone who
wants to drink beer and watch
the game," said Hill, who was
dressed in a German tavern girl's
outfit.
Other aspects of the event also
resembled the original German
Oktoberfest.
"In every Oktoberfest celebra-
tion that I read about on the In-
ternet, they always had the yo-deling contest and the chicken
dance contest," Hill said.
Her husband, Paul Hill, orga-
nized the yodeling competition.
When no one volunteered to
compete, he went around the tent
and asked people to give him
their best yodel.
"It is to attract anyone who
wants to drink beer and
watch the game."
Kendra Hill
Oktoberfest organizer
Using the audience's applause
to determine the winner, Sue
Maracle triumphed over the com-
petition with her loud and melo-
dious yodel.
She won a beer-shaped Ok-
toberfest hat and beer-shaped
glasses.
Not all of the events in the tent
were spared from an American
influence.
The first two events held dur-
ing Saturday's Oktoberfest were
the second annual hot-dog eating
contests -one for adults and one
for children -where contestants
scarfed down as many hot dogsas they could in three minutes
while listening to the German
folk music.
The adult hot-dog eating con-
test pitted UF student Chris Fell,
24, against the 15-year-old unde-
feated champion, Tyler Brower.
Brower won by gorging a total
of nine hot dogs in comparison to
Fell's seven.
"It feels pretty good," Brower
said. "I figured I would win."
Each contestant received a
trophy with a hot dog on it, and
the winners of both competitions
received $25.
According to Jesse Lewis, the
president and general manager of
fair operations, the changes that
were introduced to the fair have
made the fair better than ever.
"We are betting on it being a
whole lot better than last year,"
Lewis said.
He said that the goal is to have
30,000 to 35,000 people attend the
fair over the course of 10 days.
The fair will continue until
Nov. 1.
It will open at 5 p.m. Monday
through Friday, and it will open
at noon on Saturdays and Sun-
days.

Pilots should have been
flying, not using laptops
There is a time and place for everything.
When operating a car, it's not time for texting. When
sitting in class, it's not time for Facebook.
And when flying a plane, it's not time for anything other
than flying a plane.
Federal safety officials said Monday that the two pilots who
overshot their destination by 150 miles were using their laptops
and "lost track of time," according to an article on CNN.com.
Air traffic controllers first tried to contact the pilots by radio,
according to the Associated Press. Other pilots tried reaching
the plane. Northwest then tried texting the pilots using an in-
plane system that chimes in the cockpit. Finally, after 78 minutes
of silence, a flight attendant told them they were off course.
The pilots are both veterans, together clocking an estimated
30,000 hours -that's 1,250 days -in the air. They have never
had violations or accidents, according to a report released by
the National Transportation Safety Board.
And fortunately, they have been suspended from flying.
Everyone is guilty of getting wrapped up in the Web when
we should be, say, writing editorials. But writing a paper doesn't
make you responsible for the lives of about 150 people that were
on board when the two were busy Internetting.
We can only imagine what the two were doing on their com-
puters for the 78 mid-air minutes that they spent incommuni-
cado from air traffic controllers.
Most airlines forbid pilots from using electronic devices or
engaging in anything unrelated to, you know, flying planes.
These days, most pilots don't have to do much between tak-
ing off and landing -except stay in contact with air traffic con-
trol, which is precisely what they failed to do.
This accident speaks to the irresistible and incredibly dis-
tracting qualities of the Internet.
Unless, of course, they were just watching some porn.
Senseless Standard
he owner of a hotel inTaos, N.M. has become
the subject of national
media coverage for his ques-
tionable management style.
Larry Whitten, a 63-year-
old former Marine, has made
a career out of turning around
failing hotels. But he has
drawn the ire of the town's
residents and civil rights orga-
nizations for requiring some
of his workers to Anglicize
their names and refrain from
speaking Spanish, according
to an Associated Press article.
Whitten made one worker
change his name from Marcos
to Mark. Another was forced
to pronounce his name dif-
ferently -Marteeen became
Martin.
Whitten, who also owned
and turned around hotels in
Florida, Texas and Oklahoma,
sees nothing wrong in whiten-
ing up his staff. He also fails to
see the implications of racism
in his demands."It has nothing to do with
racism. I'm not doing it for
any reason other than for the
satisfaction of my guests, be-
cause people calling from all
over America don't know the
Spanish accents or the Spanish
culture or Spanish anything,"
Whitten said, according to the
article.
Catering topotential guests
is one thing. (But, really, who
wants to serve a guest who
would refuse service from
Maria but not Mary?)
Suppressing ethnic diver-
sity is something else entirely.
It's rare to find a city in the
U.S. that hasn't been "Angli-
cized" with Wal-Marts and
Walgreens.
Taos is a beautiful city
with some of the best tamales
we've ever had (thank you,
Leona's Restaurante).
Written needs to realize
that America is not full of
people exactly like him -old,
white and bitter.

People in relationships shouldn't settle
think that, in some cases, one of the most ethical, selfless
things you can do in a relationship is end it. And I think
one of those cases is when you realize that, by staying
with your significant other, you'd be settling for them.
That's a little bit counterintuitive. In general, it seems
like the conventional wisdom is that settling in relation-
ships, far from being enough of a reason to break up, is a
given. The line of reasoning is usually couched with decla-
rations of how hard it is to find someone you just even sort
of like, and if you can find a person who makes your life
even the tiniest bit happier, you should consider yourself
lucky. Admonishments of being grateful for what you have
rather than pouting over what you don't usually follow.
But this isn't an issue of gratitude or pouting. It's an is-
sue of selflessness.
There is, after all, a certain level of presumptuousness
about wanting to be in a relationship with someone who's
looking for somebody to love.
Any relationship that's predicated on a more compel-
ling reason than "I want to hit that" always begins with
a request -perhaps implicit -for someone to put their
own search for a person to love on hold because you think
you might be that person.
There's a pretty sizable opportunity cost involved with
accepting that request -in the form of both not being
available to other potential significant others and not be-
ing able to use the time that a relationship requires to find
potential significant others. That's the automatic, obliga-
tory sacrifice everybody makes when they agree to be in
a relationship.
In these terms, it can seem pretty daunting. But this
shouldn't paralyze us into inaction, but it does provide
good motivation to act in good faith and not screw around
with people's hearts.
And acting in good faith means not letting someone
continue to make that automatic, obligatory sacrifice a mo-
ment longer than they need to.fl'U
Joe Dellosa
Ietters@alligator orgThat requires some fortitude. It's
easy to end a relationship because
something is wrong. It's tougher to
end a relationship because some-
thing is not right. And there's no
doubt that relationships you're set-
tling for can be pleasant -it's nice to
have someone whose hand you can
hold, or someone to fall asleep with
on a cold night, or someone to whom
you can come home, even if you don't think they're the
one with whom you're meant to be. And hell, sometimes
it's just nice for your relationship status to say something
other than "single."
But nobody wants to be an interchangeable cog or a ro-
mantic placeholder. As shitty a feeling as it is to be aware
that you're settling for someone, it doesn't compare to how
awful it is to know you're being settled for. And it's wrong
to place somebody in that position, just as it's wrong to
mentally add "relatively speaking" at the end of an "I love
you" to them.
To be clear, this is by no means a call to be unadven-
turous with your love life -sometimes meeting the one
you love means taking a chance and dating someone you
wouldn't normally think is your type, and sometimes it
means fighting to fix a broken relationship.
And we are not under any obligation to think that every
person in the world is beautiful and special, or whatever
other clich6 Tenderheart Bear tried to drive into our heads
after kicking Professor Coldheart's ass.
But we do have a responsibility to try to treat people as
though there's someone who does think that about them,
even if we don't -and to remember that every moment
you spend with someone you can't genuinely appreciate is
a moment they could be spending with someone who can.

PETA approach too violent
PETA's support for the humane
treatment of animals is admirable, but
their methods are questionable when
they show violent videos with scenes of
graphic animal abuse.
When a picture may have gotten the
message across, showing an extended
video is just gratuitous violence. What
purpose does it serve? For example, if we
wanted to prevent rape, is it necessary to
actually show a woman being raped be-
fore the viewer would be convinced?
I am also concerned about the ethical
treatment of animals, but I am offended
by the shocking tactics employed by
PETA. Most people would respond posi-
tively toward animal care without PETA
resorting to the use of horrific images of
the animal industry. PETA needs to use
a compassionate appeal to win support,
instead of forcing people to avoid PETA
and the gruesome details.
What about the health benefits of be-
ing a vegan? PETA only speaks of the
social and environmental effects, which
is strange when one of the biggest prob-
lems society faces today is obesity.
People would be more interested
in hearing about vegan health benefits
rather than witnessing a slaughterhouse
scene. Which would convince you?

Gators need to give all in Georgia
Dear Gators football team,
We, the fans, are starting to get a little
concerned. We couldn't be happier with
a 7-0 start, but lately things have been a
little rocky. To call the Arkansas game a
nail-biter would be a gross understate-
ment. There were times when we didn't
put our all into screaming and cheering,
but it didn't always seem like you put
your all into that game either.
Even if we didn't do our best through-
out the game, when you asked us to
scream louder, we poured everything
we had into making The Swamp an
unbearable place for opposition (Death
Valley? Ha, make a visit to The Swamp).
The things we do go beyond any sense of
sanity. We've spent two weeks pay just
to watch you play Charleston Southern,
driven 590 miles to be harassed by people
who think it's cool to spell 'go' g-e-a-u-x,
sat through games in pouring rain and
110-degree heat, and argued with oppos-

Students should boycott Aramark
We often talk about justice and do-
ing the right thing. Well, supporting the
Coalition of Immokalee Workers is one
way we could actually practice what we
preach. Several food service providers
have agreed to pay the one cent more per
pound, but I have yet to hear that Ara-
mark has decided to do the same.
Therefore, I propose that UF students,
faculty and staff refrain from purchasing
and eating Aramark's tomatoes because
we know that they are a product of vir-
tual slave labor. This could be accom-
plished by not selecting tomatoes when
ordering sandwiches from Subway or
any of the Boar's Head locations and not
choosing to include tomatoes in your sal-
ad at the dining hall. Do the right thing
and stand for justice. This boycott is just
what we need to do to let Aramark know
that we will not support them exploiting
slave labor to make profits.

Students: Speak out at Senate
Anyone who made it out to the Co-
alition of Immokalee Workers protest
on Saturday could tell you how just the
struggle of these workers is. Because to-
day there is a resolution being discussed
in Student Senate that would help these
people in their struggle, I hope we all
have a chance to make it at 7:30 p.m. in
Reitz Union Room 282 for a public debate
so we can speak out for this righteous is-
sue. Let's do our part to ensure slavery
never comes back to Immokalee. I have
faith the Progress Party will be able to
push the legislation through.

UF gets 600 doses
of HINI vaccine
While UF health care work-
ers in the areas with the highest
risks are now able to receive the
HINI swine flu vaccine through
UF, it's not clear when students
and faculty will be able to do the
same.
The university was given
about 600 dosesNational of the swine flu
News vaccine, which
will be adminis-
tered to employees in the emer-
gency, infection control, pediat-
rics, labor and delivery, mother/
baby and oncology departments
and the intensive care units at
the hospital and the university,
according to UF's swine flu Web
site, www.ehs.ufl.edu/hlnl.
Dr. Phillip Barkley, direc-
tor of the Student Health CareCenter, said UF has requested
about 45,000 doses of the vaccine
for the general population, but
said he doesn't know when they
might arrive.
Barkley also said he didn't
expect UF to receive all 45,000
requested doses.
Alachua County received
its first shipment of swine flu
vaccine, 2,600 doses, about two
weeks ago.
Nationally, the government
has announced it will have up
to 30 million doses ready by the
end of the month.
The SHCC has seen about
1,000 people for flu or flu-like
symptoms since the beginning of
the semester, according to num-
bers on UF's Web site.
-THOMAS STEWARTCreators hope to offer app on all smart phones
IPH ON E, from page 1 campus events and anyone with
an affiliation with UF can use it,"
his phone but was disappointed
because the site was slow and
didn't include GPS.
"The original idea was just to
do a campus map, but it has ex-
panded past that," Dubno said.
Dubno worked with David
Khey, an e-Learning support ser-
vices employee, to make UFmo-
bile the official UF application.
"I was a webmaster last year
for the Department of Languag-
es, Literatures and Cultures, and
I talked to my boss about the app
and he put me in contact with
David," Dubno said.
Khey has been the middleman
between Dubno and Academic
Technology, a group of UF fac-
ulty members focused on making
technological advances to help
further education, Khey said.
"I would've loved to have
this [application] when I was in
school," Khey said.
UFmobile is not only benefi-
cial to students, Dubno said.
"Prospective students can use
it, alumni can stay up to date onDubno said.
Dubno and Khey are already
working on updates for the ap-
plication, which would include
information from RTS, Student
Government and lectures from
the business school.Khey also hopes to work on
making the application available
to all smart phones.
Since Thursday, there have
already been 159 downloads of
UFmobile.
To download the application,
search UFmobile in the App Store
on your iPhone or iPod Touch.

Tebow turning ball over at uncharacteristically high rate
THE QUARTERBACK HAS
MATCHED HIS INTERCEPTION
TOTAL FROM LAST YEAR.
By KYLE MAISTRI
Alligator Staff Writer
kmaistri@alligator org
Tim Tebow is setting personal
highs in multiple statistical catego-
ries this season -unfortunately,
they're not the categories he would
hope.
Florida's senior quarterback has
thrown four interceptions and lost
four fumbles through his first seven
games, putting him in unexplored
territory.
Until this year, Tebow had nev-
er turned the ball over more than
six times in a full season (2007,
2008) and he had never lost more
than three fumbles in a full season
(2006).
Making matters worse, the for-
mer Heisman Trophy winner lost
fumbles in the red zone against
Tennessee and Arkansas and com-
mitted his third red-zone turnover
this weekend against Mississippi
State when cornerback Johnthan
Banks returned an interception 100
yards for a touchdown.

Parsons ready for new
season without Calathes
By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
aberry@alligator org
Chandler Parsons has traded in his buzz
cut for a mop top -a new look for a player
looking for a fresh start.
The 6-foot-9 swingman will take the
floor for Florida this year without longtime
friend and teammate Nick Calathes for the
first time since high school.
Between the seemingly endless on-
slaught of questions during the team's me-
dia day about his haircut -or apparent
lack thereof -and his former roommate,
Parsons noted that losing Calathes and
adding some extra hair won't change his
personality or performance on the court."I'm not going to do anything different.
I'm not going to force any shots or say I'm
going to go out there and get 30 a game just
because he's gone now," Parsons said. "I've
just got to stay confident,
and with or without Nick,
I'm going to continue to
play my game."
Parsons showed occa-
sional flashes of brilliance
last season, particularly
at Vanderbilt on Jan. 25,
Parsons when he scored 27 points
on 7-of-8 shooting from 3-point range and
led the team with eight rebounds.
But his up-and-down play throughout
his first two years has been cause for con-

Alabama narrowly escaped with a 12-

and Ingram had one of his worst games
in recent memory. He rushed for 99
yards on 18 carries and failed to catch
a pass for the first time all season. It also marked
the first time this season Ingram didn't find the end
zone. Still, the sophomore's numbers and 'Bama's

just two points out of first place.

Meyer: Tebow playing as hard as ever but not at highest level
FOOTBALL, from page 13
trating," Tebow said. "I'm not going to lie
to you and say it's not frustrating because
obviously we want to score [touchdowns]
every time we get in the red zone, and the
turnovers are frustrating, just things that
we're not used to doing.
"It could possibly be a good thing be-
cause that could give us a little bit of edge
of, 'Hey, we haven't arrived and we've still
got a lot of work to do.' That's something
to really motivate us because that's not us,
that's not the way we've always playedand it's just frustrating."
Banks later took another interception
back for a touchdown in the fourth quar-
ter, this time for 21 yards.
Prior to Saturday's game, only Tennes-
see safety Eric Berry had ever returned a
pass thrown by Tebow for a touchdown -
Banks topped that in one game.
Regardless of his NFL prospects or his
tendency to tuck the ball and run when the
pocket starts to collapse, one thing that has
never been a knock on Tebow is ball secu-
rity. The lefty threw just 11 interceptions
in his first three years.
Fumbles lost can often be a deceivingstat, as recovery is largely dependent on
circumstance and luck, but Tebow is put-
ting it on the ground at a faster pace than
ever before.
He has been "unlucky"
this season, as the opposition
has recovered all four of his
fumbles, but the only seasonFootball in which he put the ball on
the ground more than four
times was 2008, when he lost two of his
five fumbles.
"Tim Tebow is not playing at his highest
level," Meyer said. "He's playing as hard
as he ever can. But it's a multitude of stuff.We've got to do a better job of getting him
in successful positions, and everybody else
has to pick up their level of play."
The defense has certainly done that this
season, holding four of UF's seven oppo-
nents without an offensive touchdown,
but the turnovers have made its job more
difficult, often setting up opposing teams
with momentum or a shorter field.
Two weeks ago, the Razorbacks scored
one of their two touchdowns after they
recovered a Tebow fumble on the Gators'
31-yard line, and the Volunteers scored 10
of their 13 points off turnovers by Tebow
in Week 3.

losing his starting spot to guard

"Hopefully this year I can be a
more consistent shooter because I
haven't been happy with the way
I've been shooting the last twoyears, obviously," he said.
Parsons finished his sopho-
more season fourth on the team
in scoring (9.2 points per game)
while shooting 46 percent from
the field, 30.1 percent from be-
yond the arc and an abysmal 55.7
percent from the free throw line.
At one point last year, Par-sons' struggles at the line cost the
Gators a win.
Up 69-68 at South Carolina
with 2 seconds left, the then-
sophomore clanged the front end
of a one-and-one off the front of
the rim, allowing the Gamecocks
to heave the ball down the court
for the game-winning layup.During individual workouts
with UF coach Billy Donovan,
Parsons devoted a lot of time to
fixing his shot.
"He'll put the tape on me, and
he'll feel like sometimes I fade
away, sometimes I'll release it on
the bottom of my shot," Parsons
said. "Little things like that I can
UF forward Chandler Parsons has worked hard to improve his shooting in the offseason. The junior averaged 9.2 points per game while
shooting 30.1 percent from 3-point range and 55.7 from the free throw line last year.correct."
Parsons added that he has
been shooting well this summer,
and he's eager to see if the offsea-
son training pays off in a game
situation.
In his junior season, Parsons
might have to take on more re-
sponsibilities in the backcourt.
Donovan said Parsons or forward
Dan Werner could potentially
even move to the point guard
spot to make up for the lack of
depth at the position.
"Hopefully this year I can
be a more consistent
shooter because I haven't
been happy with the way
I've been shooting the last
two years, obviously."
Chandler Parsons
UFjunior forward
"With Werner and Parsons -
because of their size and their
ability to pass the ball and handle
it pretty well -that at least gives
me some semblance of comfort
that we can slide one of those
guys back there," Donovan said.
"That's not ideal for us, but it can
hopefully help at least eliminate a
potential problem."
Fortunately, Parsons isn't en-
tirely unfamiliar with the posi-
tion Calathes played for UF the
last two years.
"When I was younger, before
I hit my spurt, I played point
guard. I don't have trouble han-
dling the ball," Parsons said. "In
pressure situations, I'd love to be
back there. I'd love to play the
point."
MCCALL, from page 13
things have to go right for a team to march down the field
and get a chance to score, and, especially in soccer, it's
still very difficult to convert those chances into something
tangible.
The closest way to compare this to football is to look
at how teams perform in the red zone. Points are easier to
come by in football -UF is the nation's No. 76 red zone
team but has still scored on 80 percent of its red-zone trips
-and it gets more interesting without field goals in the
equation.
Look at the Gators' stats when it comes to touchdowns
in the red zone, and they're operating at a rate closer to a
good soccer team than a good football team.In five Southeastern Conference games, they've scored
seven TDs on 25 red-zone trips (28 percent).
Arsenal, which leads the English Premier League in
scoring, has notched six goals in a match twice. In those
two net-busting performances, it converted 33 percent
and 25 percent of its shots into goals.
Florida's percentage is great for soccer, bad for foot-
ball.
On six red-zone drives Saturday, UF managed just one
touchdown, a total the Bulldogs matched thanks to John-
than Banks' 100-yard interception return.
These red-zone troubles are making a pretty good of-
fense look like garbage.
The Gators are in the NCAA's top 10 for rushing, total
and scoring offense, and if they could translate all those
yards and scoring opportunities into touchdowns, they'dbe blowing teams away.
In the first half Saturday, they almost doubled MSU's
time of possession and racked up more than three times as
many yards, yet they only led 13-10.
That's unacceptable, and if the trend continues, it could
easily lead to losses.
It's frustrating to see the offense steadily move across
the field and then look totally lost when it's TD time -
like UF is playing fdtbol when it should be playing foot-
ball.
The Gators are blessed with a defense that equates to a
brick-wall keeper who can also score goals, but they can't
keep missing chances in front of the net.
If they turn that around, their chances of reaching the
national championship game in the Rose Bowl -the site
of the 1994 World Cup Final- will be as bright as ever.

Butler putting more responsibility on seniors' shoulders
- I
Alligator File Photo
Redshirt senior guard Susan Yenser had wrist bands designed for Florida's senior class with each of the
players' jersey numbers on one side and "Fab Five" on the other.0 THE FIVE VETERANS MEET
WITH HER WEEKLY.
By EUGENIO TORRENS
Alligator Writer
etorrens@alligator org
Being a senior for Florida coach
Amanda Butler was already a pres-
sure-filled situation.
But now, Butler and the coaching
staff, who are entering their third
season together, know this group of
veterans best, and Butler has used
that familiarity to put more respon-
sibility than ever on her seniors to
lead by example.
"I put a lot of pressure on the se-
niors because it is their last chance,
and it should mean more to them in
a different way than it can to any-
one else that's on the team," Butler
said.
The seniors meet weekly to dis-
cuss the status of the team, and But-
ler meets with them every couple of
weeks as a routine check-up on the
state of the team.
It just further demonstrates the
intensified level of communication
being built between the eldest play-
ers and the coaching staff.
Redshirt senior Susan Yenser
loved leaving those meetings with
Butler with a renewed sense of
structure and heightened passion.
"You seriously can't walk out of
a meeting with Butler just ho-hum,"
Yenser said.
Yenser is one of five seniors tak-ing on the responsibility of bring-
ing the team together. She designed
and ordered wrist bands containing
each of the seniors' numbers on one
side and "Fab Five" on the other.
As a senior, Sharielle Smith said,
one of the biggest things for her has
been to make sure the freshmen
know how things go. Freshman
Lily Svete has definitely noticed,
and appreciated, the seniors telling
her and her fellow freshmen where
to go during certain drills in which
they may be confused or lost.
"You have to put people in
place," Steffi Sorensen said. "You
got to be a good senior and let peo-
ple know what they're doing wrong-you don't necessarily have to yell
at them or get in their face."
Minimizing the learning dis-
crepancy between the older and
younger players is a huge focus in
these early stages of the season, and
seniors are expected to be vocal in
order to establish that cohesion ear-
lier rather than later.
"If you don't have the first play-
er and the 14th player on the same
page, then you're not really pro-
gressing," Yenser said.
The pressure to progress quickly
is met with a greater urgency by the
team's veteran leaders, who don't
have as much time left with the
program.
"You come home every single
day wondering what you did to get
better that day, because you can't
get that day back," Yenser said.
"It's the last go around."
