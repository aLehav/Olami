 COLLEGE STATION, Texas — 
In Texas A&M’s ﬁ  rst game in a new 
league, the Gators showed the Ag-
gies what Southeastern Conference 
football — speciﬁ  cally Florida’s brand of football — is all about. 
  No. 18 Florida’s 20-17 win 
against Texas A&M on Saturday in College Station was the type of physical, grind-it-out affair coach Will Muschamp craves.  The resil-ient rushing attack and second-half 
defense the Gators rode to victory 
are the tenets Muschamp hopes will become emblematic of his pro-gram.
  The product wasn’t always 
pretty, but that’s the identity Mus-champ is looking to establish. 
  “We’re going to win a lot of 
games like this,” Muschamp said. 
“That’s just who we are. We’re go-
ing to grind it out. We’re going to win.”
  After Texas A&M moved the ball at will to take a 17-10 lead into halftime, Florida took control of the line of scrimmage. The Aggies 
gained 269 yards in the ﬁ  rst half 
but only 65 in the second. 
  The Gators also established 
their physicality on offense, grind-ing out 126 yards on the ground in 
the second half after only 16 in the 
ﬁ  rst. 
  “In the 
second half, 
we really 
dominated 
the line of scrimmage,” Muschamp said. 
  That dominance showed down 
the stretch. Mike Gillislee’s 12-yard touchdown run with 13:05 left in the fourth gave UF a 20-17 lead, and Florida drained the ﬁ  nal 
3:13 of regulation with eight con-
secutive rushing plays. Muschamp called the sequence “the happiest moment in Florida history,” as the Gators started the postgame cel-
ebration on their own terms. 
  “Last year, I don’t know, man,” Muschamp said. “I don’t know if 
we would’ve won this ballgame.”
  Guard Jon Halapio said Flor-
ida’s conﬁ  dence and willingness to battle from behind were vastly improved compared to last season, showing signs of Muschamp mak-
ing his mark on the program.
  Muschamp acknowledged the 
beating he took from the media af-ter a lackluster Week 1 win against Bowling Green but said he saw the 
dividends from that stubborn, run-based grinding on Saturday. When

KISSIMMEE — Nine years ago, 
President Barack Obama was still pay-
ing off his student loans.
Obama stood in front of a crowd of 
about 3,000 adult and student specta-tors Saturday to speak about every-thing from education to health care. The speech was part of Obama’s two-day Florida tour to sway voters in the swing state.
During his speech, Obama said his 
administration has made progress to help America’s youth, including health care legislation and changes in ﬁ  nan-cial aid.White House Press Secretary Jay 
Carney said Obama understands the concerns of students, especially be-cause of the student loans he spent years paying off.
Jen Psaki, the trav-
eling campaign press secretary for the Obama campaign, said the campaign aims to remind peo-ple of the importance of being politically involved.
“He wanted to speak directly to the 
people of the state about the choice they’re facing in November and re-Obama focuses on youth 
during tour of Florida � UF IS JOINING A NATIONAL TREND.

Adiel Benitz knows what it’s like to be 
stressed.
The 18-year-old architecture freshman 
took four Advanced Placement classes in high 
school, ran both track and cross country and 
worked part time as a waiter. Yet, compared to his ﬁ  rst three weeks in college, that was a piece of cake.
“In high school, one or two nights a se-
mester I would stay up late,” he said. “The extremes in high school become the norm.”
Benitz has already joined students across 
the country in being anxious. Increases in the 
amounts of students seeking counseling have 
been reported at colleges recently, and UF is no exception.The UF Counseling and Wellness Center 
has seen nearly a 60 percent increase in the amount of students coming in for help than they did at this point last year, director Sherry Benton said.
“There is a large difference,” she said. 
“There is a very big increase in students who report a history of abuse; nightmares and ﬂ  ashbacks; and trauma symptoms.”
Benton partially attributed the increase 
to media coverage of current events such as shootings, natural disasters and the Pennsyl-UF sees 60 percent increase in

— Heather White 
Director, Career Resource CenterSept. 10, 1981: Computers become more widely used, 
but students lack the skills to operate them. UF professors 
believe computer illiteracy will be a problem for employ-ers in the future. A computer lab manager said all business students have been trained in computer language, a policy 
that’s been in effect since at least 1971. 
Sept. 14, 1994: A USF sophomore kidnaps two 16-year-
old boys at gunpoint, leads police on a high-speed chase and 
eventually shoots one of the boys and himself. The chase, which took place in northeast Gainesville, reached speeds of 70 miles per hour and ended with one of the boys escaping, but the other staying trapped with the suspect. The boy who was shot remained in critical condition at Shands at UF, and 
the suspect died soon after he shot himself.
Sept. 10, 1999: Happy and Flower, two Asian small-
clawed otters from Disney’s Animal Kingdom, join the Santa 
Fe Community College Teaching Zoo. The otters spent the first 30 days in a holding facility to make sure they were healthy enough before being introduced to the exhibit. They joined mother and daughter otters, Bhandara and Snaggle-tooth.
Sept. 11, 2001: The Manhattan skyline was forever 
changed when two airliners crashed into the World Trade Center. Another plane crashed into one side of the Pentagon in Washington, D.C., and a fourth crashed in an open field in Pennsylvania. The four planes carried 266 people with no known survivors. About 200 firefighters died in rescue ef-forts, but the complete death toll would not be confirmed until weeks later. No one took responsibility for the attacks, 
but federal authorities said Osama bin Laden was the prime 
suspect. In Gainesville, many UF students consoled each oth-er, some donated blood for crisis victims and all listened to “The Star-Spangled Banner” as it rang from Century Tower.

The guests of honor on UF’s 
campus Friday night came hairy, 
winged and hungry.
The Florida Museum of Nat-
ural History partnered with Gainesville’s nonprofit Lubee Bat Conservancy to host the Year of the Bat Celebration.
At the museum, a mixed 
crowd of adults, students and 
children chose from 12 different 
activities that taught them about the importance of bats. 
One display showed types of 
food and drinks bats make pos-sible by pollination including mangos, oranges and tequila. Bat feces can be used as fertil-
izer, too.
“Bats save farmers $3 [billion] 
to $20 billion a year,” said Brian Pope, director of Lubee Bat Con-servancy. “But 40 percent of bat 
species in the United States are 
threatened with extinction due to overhunting and deforestation.”
Later, more than 100 visitors 
lined the fence in front of the bat house and barn on Museum Road to watch the nightly emergence of bats as they fly out to catch their dinner of insects.
UF alumna Emily Taylor said 
she and her 3-year-old son, Jaco-by, came to the event specifically to see the emergence.
As soon as the thousands of 
bats began flying over the tree-tops and Lake Alice, it became his favorite part of the night. His mom agreed.
“It’s like a river of bats and 
something you see in a movie,” Taylor said.Gainesville celebrates year of the bat

director of Lubee Bat Conservancymind them what’s at stake,” Psaki said.
Obama further rallied the crowd by high-
lighting what he has done and will do for the 
country’s youth. He said he plans to give all Americans the opportunity to compete in to-day’s job market.
If re-elected, he proposed to cut the growth 
of college tuition in half. He also said that his environmental agenda would create more jobs in the United States.
“It is a vital interest of young people in 
this country that we do something about our dependence on foreign oil,” Carney said.
Investing in all forms of energy, such as 
biofuels, wind and solar, will create more jobs in the U.S., Carney said.
Although Obama has made various cam-
paign visits to large universities like Ohio State University and the University of Colo-rado, Psaki didn’t mention whether Obama would make an appearance at UF in the fu-ture.UF College Democrats President William 
Farrell said he would love it if Obama came to speak at UF.
“I would want to hear about his experi-
ence in the White House and his plans for the future,” said Farrell, 20.
Farrell, an environmental science major, 
commended the president’s work to lower interest rates on student loans as well as in-suring young adults through the Affordable Care Act.
“It’s a tough economy,” said Farrell. 
“Coming out of college with health care is reassuring.”
The bus tour started in Seminole and Kis-
simmee on Saturday and continued to Mel-bourne and West Palm Beach on Sunday.
“We’re here for two days, because we 
don’t take any voter for granted,” Psaki said.
By the end of the event, spectators were 
sweaty but nonetheless roaring with ap-plause for Obama’s 36-minute speech.
“We’re not going back,” he said. “We are 
moving forward.”4, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 10, 2012

After closing in 2011, Alachua Coun-
ty’s Boys & Girls Club has its mentoring 
center back.
About 100 Gainesville residents 
gathered Saturday to celebrate the re-
opening of the Boys & Girls Club of 
Alachua County’s Rotary Campus & Mentor Center.
The center, located at 1100 SE 17th 
Drive, provides free academic tutoring to students in kindergarten through third grade. The center closed due to funding issues and a lack of space, said Liz Martin, the director of the Mentor 
Center.
The new Mentor Center receives its 
primary funding from the Community 
Foundation of North Central Florida, Martin said.
The center is focusing its attention 
on the Lincoln Heights neighborhood in Gainesville’s east side, which is histori-cally known as a low-income area. It ex-
pects to give individualized instruction 
to students from nearby schools, includ-ing Joseph Williams Elementary School.
Parents and guardians brought their 
children to the event Saturday to sign them up for mentoring programs. An-other organization, Kids Count in Ala-chua County , offered free after-school 
programs, which provide help for read-
ing and social skills.
Fewer than 50 percent of Alachua 
County low-income students who went into ninth grade five years ago will graduate this year, according to a Kids Count press release.
“Our short-term goal is to get kids 
on or above grade level,” said Jessica Belcoure, a program assistant for Kids Count.
Mary Banks, a 53-year-old Gainesville 
resident, was among those who stood in line. Banks signed up her grandchildren, 
ages 5, 7 and 9, for mentoring help.
She gained custody of the children, 
but she lost her job of 35 years a few 
months ago. She said she wants her grandchildren to get extra help but doesn’t always have time to help all three by herself.
“This is some hope,” she said.Mentoring center offers

More students qualified Friday for Student 
Government elections than did on the first day 
of qualifying last semester.
Qualifying, which determines whether a 
candidate is eligible to be a student senator, con-
tinues today and Tuesday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
in Room 284 of the Reitz Union.
On Friday, 78 students qualified, accord-
ing to Supervisor of Elections Stephen Davis. 
This amount is less than the first day last Fall

ligator archives.
Once qualified, a student can interview 
with a political party. The Students Party inter -
viewed 26 students on Friday , Students Party Campaign Manager Dave Bradshaw said. He said the party is not making any decisions until it sees every possible candidate.
“We have good candidates in over half the 
seats already,” Bradshaw said. “But we certain-ly need more.”
The Swamp Party, which was created by 
former Unite Party senators, interviewed 40 stu-dents Friday , Swamp Party Spokesman Daniel Landesberg said. He said the party is still trying to get the word out, but he expects more stu-dents to interview today and Tuesday.
“What we are really looking for is quality, 
not quantity,” he said.
Hannah Kaufman, who hopes to represent 
Hume Hall, said she qualified but did not inter -
view with a party.The 18-year-old political science freshman 
said she’ll most likely run as an independent 
senator.
“I don’t think I identify with a party yet,” 
Kaufman said. “I feel there is a lot of Greek-
versus-non-Greek tension and, even though I’m Greek, I don’t want people to see me that way for political reasons.”
Students will be able to vote for their student 
representatives Oct. 2 and Oct. 3.

“The history stirs up feelings 
and triggers more symptoms,” she said. “New trauma stirs up old trauma.”
UF’s counselors understand stress doesn’t always come from trauma. Benton recommended any student feeling stressed visit the 
center to help them cope. Appoint-
ments can normally be made by phone, but students who feel like they are in a crisis can simply come 
in and see an on-call counselor, she 
said.
Counseling can help students manage the anxiety that often ac-
companies the start of classes. 
That’s a feeling architecture fresh-man Katie Fisher has experienced.
“I had a freak-out moment on

Fisher has managed to keep her 
job at Outback Steakhouse, but she said she’s been forced to cut her work schedule from about five nights a week to one or two.
To keep stress levels down, Ben-
ton said students should exercise four to five days a week. Meditation and taking walks can also help.“Most people have things to do 
to relieve stress, but when they get really busy, they tell themselves, ‘I 
don’t have time. I don’t have time. 
I don’t have time,’” she said. “The reality is, if they did do those ac-tivities, their study time would be 
productive, their memory more 
concentrated and they would learn more material more quickly.”

Students with budding busi-
ness ideas now have another place 
they can grow their plans.
EnCoSpace, located at 1201 E. 
University Ave., provides rentable 
ofﬁ  ce space for Gainesville start-
ups. Customers have the option to work in an open area with other people or in private ofﬁ  ce spaces.“They get more of an ofﬁ  ce en-
vironment without it being a typi-cal cubicle-type ofﬁ  ce,” said 60-year-old owner Pete Carr.
The business charges $10 per 
person for a half day. A full day costs $20.
Carr came up with the idea 
while running for Colorado gov-ernor in 2010. Carr said he wanted to put a center like this in every county in Colorado.Carr did not win the governor’s 
seat, but he stuck with the idea. He chose Gainesville, because he said he lived in the city for seven years and knows the city’s entrepreneur-ial spirit.
“There are a lot of startups that 
come directly out of UF,” Carr said.
Jamie Kraft, director of UF’s 
Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation, said the concept is like a traditional business incubator with a slightly different model.
“I think it’s a tremendous op-
portunity for individuals to work together to move their ideas for-ward,” Kraft said.
Alberto Chavez, a 20-year-old 
accounting senior, said he would be interested in EnCoSpace be-cause he has considered starting a company.
“I think that would really be 
helpful because I wouldn’t really 
know how to go about starting my 
own business,” Chavez said.
Carr said he hopes to open an 
additional center downtown in the future to give budding entrepre-neurs a place to work.
“We just provide the facility, 
and it’s like a garden,” he said. “We provide the plot of land, we 
help you till it and we see what 
grows.”

 � SPEAKERS GAVE TIPS ON 
KEEPING ENERGY BILLS LOW.

Gainesville’s green scene got some 
attention Saturday when various en-
ergy executives taught residents about energy conservation.
Alachua County’s sustainability de-
partment, alongside energy conserva-tion companies, held an energy work-shop that covered topics such as solar energy and home energy efﬁ  ciency.
Several initiatives across the city 
have added solar panels to Gainesville buildings such as the Beta Theta Pi fra-ternity house.
Stuart Block, a 22-year-old sustain-
ability studies senior, spoke at the semi-nar about how he and others got the $44,000 solar system on the roof of the fraternity house.He discussed how the systems work 
and described, step-by-step, some of the best ways for people to go solar such as 
installing smaller solar panels on hot 
water heaters.
Another speaker, Kevin V each, of 
Green Energy Options, spoke about how to ﬁ  nd and insulate air seepage that drive up energy bills. His company specializes in the diagnostic tests that discover and ﬁ  x the leaks.
Sean McLendon, the sustainability 
program manager for Alachua County, said he’s excited for the way the green movement is going in the area.
“The most exciting thing is we’ve 
reached a point with solar energy where more than ever before it’s becoming a better long-term investment for a great-er number of people,” he said. “Even if solar power isn’t affordable, conserva-
tion and efﬁ  ciency is well within every-
one’s reach.”

political party’s national convention? Today’s question: Is school stressing you out? Paul Lyin’ 
Don’t compare Paul 
Ryan and Joe Biden 
Biggest difference between Joe Biden and Paul Ryan? Cha-
risma.
They’re each hitting the campaign trails harder now 
that both national conventions are over. But their approaches are starkly different.
Ryan’s had to explain what he actually meant by his totally-
ran-a-marathon-under-two-hours claim; it’s been so long since he ran one that he wasn’t sure what a normal time was any-more.
“I hurt my back when I was about 23 or 24, and I had to quit 
running. I herniated a disk in my back,” Ryan said. “So I’ve just lost perspective on what normal times are. I ran an ordinary race, and I thought the answer I gave was an ordinary time. Ob-viously it wasn’t.”
Because a good amount of Ryan’s speech at the Republican 
National Convention was just, like, deﬁ  nitely lies, he’s had to go on the defense on as many talk shows that would take him.
To sum up his experience on CBS’s “Face the Nation”: Norah 
O’Donnell “would ask Ryan a question about a past vote that contradicted what he says now; Ryan would tell her she was wrong, and then launch an attack on President Obama,” accord-ing to the Chicago Tribune.
Ryan continues to avoid giving any actual details that a Rom-
ney/Ryan tax plan would contain.
On ABC’s “This Week” with George Stephanopoulos, Steph-
anopoulos asked how the Republican ticket would keep its tax plan revenue neutral without getting rid of middle-class tax deductions, a topic Bill Clinton mentioned in his speech during the Democratic National Convention; when Ryan quibbled on an answer, saying something about how most of the studies on their tax plan have been discredited, Stephanopoulos asked if he could then give speciﬁ  cs on how the plan would work.
“We want to have this debate in the public,” Ryan said. He 
also said that he and Romney would like to draft a plan ﬁ  rst and put it before Congress.
Biden, on the other hand, is just being Biden and loving it.“The last time I was here … I didn’t get arrested, but I almost 
did,” said Biden to a crowded community center in Ohio.
When he was on the University of Delaware football team 
in 1963, he was invited into one of the women’s dormitories on campus.
“I thought I was walking into the waiting room. I got brought 
into the hallway. And I got escorted out very quickly by an Ath-ens policeman. True story, unfortunately,” Biden said.
His genial stops around the country are dotted with person-
al anecdotes that are not only hilarious and engaging but also true.
That’s more than we can say for Ryan’s personal stories or 
political facts.
Fundamentally, it seems like Romney and Ryan are discon-
nected from what real people actually want: funny and honest 
stories about almost getting arrested.
Not when they bring you a lie sandwich served with a side of 
lies but forget the truth platter you ordered at the window.Musical artists focus on dollars, not beats
Thursday night, MTV aired its annual Video Music 
Awards. Predictably so, it featured a joking Kevin Hart, performances of various calibers and debat-
able choices in award recipients. However, while watch-ing different clips of the evening, what I noticed most was 
how much the network has changed from what it used to 
be.
It’s a well-known truth that MTV took its main focus 
off music long ago. For the past few years, the only time I’ve ever really watched the network has been for music videos broadcast late at night or into the early morning and to see interesting episodes of the documentary series “True Life.”
After “The Real World” debuted, reality shows, script-
ed dramas and programs that seemed like outrageous combinations of the two somehow stole virtually all of the network’s airtime.
The evolution of the channel brings me to how much 
music as a professional industry has changed since years ago.
The other day, one of my Pandora radio stations began 
to play an a cappella Boyz II Men track. I was taken aback when I realized music used to sound like that, let alone 
that it actually could.
Their harmony was ﬂ  awless.
Compared to what had been playing on the station be-
fore, the three-minute track opened my ears to some of the most refreshing vocals I had heard in a while.
Every musical act won’t sell 60 million albums world-
wide like this R&B group, but I do wish today’s music re-quired and showed more effort from writers, producers and vocalists than it does.
Artists have become very comfortable with the fact that 
they can take in so much revenue from endeavors outside of recording music.
According to a recent article in Forbes, Dr. Dre is now 
the richest man in hip-hop, earning $110 million in the last year, not because of making beats, but because of sales of his high-priced Beats headphones. The story also men-tioned how stars like Lil Wayne and Nicki Minaj managed to bring in millions with the help of several product endorsements. You may have recently seen their heavily circulated commercials endorsing Mountain Dew and 
Adidas, respectively.
Forbes looked at income from 
touring, record sales, publish-
ing, ﬁ  lms, merchandise sales, en-dorsements and other ventures.
The minority of those categories focus explicitly on the 
music these entertainers create.
It’s obvious that a multiplatform approach is the way 
to make the most money, but music artists should still feel 
a need to produce quality material.
I frequently reminisce and feel as though things were 
much better in the late ‘90s, when I was a kid, compared to 
how they are now. TV , movies and music especially had a special something about them that allow us today to call them our favorites and refer to them as classics.
Musical artists used to be, well, artists. Each individual 
or group had its own unique identity that set it apart from others.
Oddly enough, today’s biggest musical acts are the 
most well-known for the most shallow reasons.
Still, inﬂ  uences from previous time periods can clearly 
be seen in the current music market. The boy band has re-emerged with groups such as The Wanted and One Direc-tion successfully capitalizing on younger consumers. The hip-hop entourage has returned with crews like Kanye West’s G.O.O.D. Music, Rick Ross’ Maybach Music Group and Lil Wayne’s Young Money.
If only the same quality of music from years past was 
also duplicated.
I will have a little more hope for my generation the day 
producers and musicians choose to focus on the music and lyrics coming out of our speakers instead of the dollars rolling into their bank accounts.

After my first week in France, I riffled through 
my luggage, turned all my pockets inside out, and in a last vain, stupidly hopeful effort, 
searched between the pages of my books. Where did all my money go?
This was not robbery, at least in the expected sense. 
What I mean is that I had robbed myself. I sat and per -
formed an agonizing mental expense report for the week. There were those really overpriced glasses of beer (most of which were purchased under drunken impulse and remain hazy in my memory), a string of excessively sumptuous lunches, various unnecessary French knickknacks, etc.
These were all consumer decisions my former in-
stincts would have instructed me to forgo, possibly even scoff at rudely in protest of such hiked, touristy prices. However, there seems to be a reflexive instinct for travelers to attempt to wring every pleasurable ex-perience from their respective locale, which is all in all a good headspace to be in, granted with certain caveats so as to avoid the consequential poverty that hitches itself to such ruthless indulgence.
A first, well-heeded piece of advice is to choose 
your moments when spending. At minimum, a study abroad program runs at least a month. This is actually a lot of time despite your travel instinct’s job to make you feel antsy and harried your whole stay.
Not every meal needs to be a service of worship to 
your taste buds. Some days you just need to get by. Here in Tours, France, you can purchase fresh produce along with hazardously long baguettes and cuts of cheap, delectable cheeses. And if you’re doing a home-
stay, you’ll probably make the rounds in terms of local 
cuisine anyway.
There is no perfect formula 
for going out cheaply here, but that’s probably true anywhere. I do have a few tips, though. First off, there are two focal points of nightlife here in Tours (at least 
that I’m aware of): Place Plumereau (a square that is 
enclosed by bars and restaurants and is in close prox-
imity to discothéques or clubs) and the guinguette (a bar/restaurant/café/general-area-down-near-the-Loire-river where hordes of drunk and/or hopeful drunks flock to).
For the young and desperately thirsty, the open con-
tainer law here will be a welcome surprise. The law basically means that you can drink in public, which in American culture is an activity traditionally reserved 
for haggard-looking alcoholics, rebellious teens, etc. 
Many of the night owls double-fist tall boys of room-temperature beers — the ice-cold variety presents the problem of numbness — or bottles of liquor that tend to be the preface to a really horrendous following morning. Some of the more serious and resilient par -
tygoers have even taken to wearing backpacks out and stocking them with choice alcoholic beverages to carry them through the night. Personally, I carry around a 
standard two-step wine opener and heft a bottle of red, 
but to each his own.
Now you won’t be able to get a seat anywhere, but 
this does mean you can offset some of the cost of drink-ing by supplementing with store-bought stuff between stays at bars or clubs. There are more devious methods you can try as well, like refilling a bar-bought glass with your own cheaply purchased stuff, but in general this is quite rude and will often get you booted out of a 
place with very little delicacy.
A last, really parent-ish sounding bit of advice is to 
make a budget for yourself. 
This might seem obscenely obvious, but you’d be 
surprised how many people coast by on guesstimated 
math and find themselves on the back end of their trip slurping ketchup packets and greedily devouring the complimentary bread at dinner.
If you live abroad smartly, you might actually have 
enough money left to buy all those souvenirs you promised.

UWireIn his speech last week at the Re-
publican National Convention, the party’s nominee, Mitt Romney, of-
fered nothing to college students reel-ing from the soaring cost of higher 
education.
According to the College Board, 
the cost of four-year colleges has in-
creased by an average of $8,244 over the past 10 years — a 72 percent rise above inflation. Outstanding student loan debt hit $914 billion, or about 45,000 times the number of students currently enrolled in American uni-
versities.
At the University of Texas, we are 
painfully aware of the skyrocketing 
costs.
“UT gave me a $20,000-per-year 
scholarship, but I found out pretty quickly that doesn’t cover every-thing,” theater and education senior Jorge Galan said. “Even with that 
scholarship, I’ll be graduating with 
over $60,000 in debt. That’ll take at least 20 years for me to pay off.” But Galan, a Texas resident, ranks among the lucky ones. In 2010, the cost of at-tendance for out-of-state students at UT reached $45,960, or 93 percent of the U.S. median household income.
And this doesn’t just affect us. The 
price of a college education has an enormously outsized impact on the economy. The economic explosion of the 1950s saw one of the sharpest rises in gross domestic product per capita in our country’s history — and it had a lot to do with Americans getting af-fordable college degrees through the GI Bill. They flooded the economy 
with both skilled workers and con-
sumers ready and eager to spend their paychecks. 
If Romney seeks to revitalize the 
economy, he should alleviate the crushing debt burying college stu-dents. It doesn’t take a Ph.D. in eco-nomics to deduce that there isn’t going to be very much revitalizing 
spending coming from an enormous 
swath of the population that’s eat-ing Ramen noodles six out of seven nights.
On this is-
sue, Romney has failed to deliver. When 
asked what he would do about college costs in March, Romney told students to “shop around.” This is sound, al-
beit somewhat obvious, financial ad-
vice. Unfortunately, he doesn’t seem to realize we’re shopping in a dis-trict where every store is out of most Americans’ price range.
But hey, perhaps Romney can be 
forgiven for not fully understanding the problem. After all, when he went to Brigham Young University in 1969, 
tuition for Mormon students was $215 
a semester. Just one semester’s worth of non-resident tuition at UT in 2012 would have allowed young Romney to attend BYU for about 80 years.
In May, Romney released a paper 
titled “A Chance for Every Child,” which blames federal spending for the exorbitant cost of college, claim-
ing that “a flood of federal dollars is 
driving up tuition and burdening too many young Americans with substan-tial debt and too few opportunities.” The paper crows that “a Romney ad-ministration will tackle this challenge by making clear that the federal gov-ernment will no longer write a blank check to universities to reward their 
tuition increases.” Instead, Romney 
plans to put the nation’s trust in the private sector to “provide informa-tion, financing and education itself.”
Contrary to Romney’s assertions, 
tuition hikes at public universities have happened largely as a result of huge funding cuts by state govern-ments. In 1985, state appropriations 
for UT Austin accounted for 47 per -
cent of the university’s budget. Tuition 
and fees accounted for no more than 5 percent. Now, tuition and fees pro-vide a quarter of UT’s budget while state funding has dwindled to a mere 13 percent. Amazingly, that actually puts UT ahead of many other state colleges. Last year, the state of Michi-gan contributed a paltry 4.5 percent of its flagship university’s budget.
Furthermore, Romney’s trust in the 
private sector is horribly misplaced. We saw how much private lenders 
care about their borrowers’ best in-
terests in 2008, when Citigroup, Leh-man Brothers and their fellows drove the economy into the ditch by issuing countless toxic mortgage loans and gambling on securities with our mon-ey. Those guys aren’t the answer. Nei-ther are the for-profit, University of Phoenix-style institutions that happen 
to be contributing enormous sums of 
money to Romney’s campaign.
All this provides opportunity for 
President Obama to draw contrast be-tween himself and his opponent, but his own response has been sadly un-derwhelming. So far, Obama has kept interest rates for subsidized Stafford loans from doubling to 6.8 percent, 
but even Romney was on board with 
that. In his second term, he plans to make permanent his American Op-portunity tax credit, which grants col-lege students up to $2,500 a year but would take $13 billion next year alone to renew. He also promises to expand the maximum Pell grant from $5,550 to $5,635, but that was already sched-
uled under current laws.
These are admirable efforts, to be 
sure, but they bring to mind trying to 
halt a wildfire with a couple dozen water balloons. In 1980, according to Education Week, the maximum Pell grant covered 77 percent of the aver -
age cost of attendance at a four-year public institution. Today, it covers 
36 percent. Even if Obama passes the 
increase he promises, that 36 percent won’t go up by even a single percent-age point. Something far more sub-stantial is necessary.
While President Obama is on the 
campaign trail this fall, I’d like for him to know the eyes of America’s college students will be upon him.

A political psychology expert will visit UF this week to dis-
cuss how people form beliefs and how they influence voting.
Jonathan Haidt, author of “The Righteous Mind: Why Good 
People are Divided by Politics and Religion,” will speak at 5:30 
p.m. Wednesday at the Bob Graham Center for Public Service. 
The event is free and open to the public. It will also be streamed 
live at www.bobgrahamcenter.ufl.edu.
Haidt has a bachelor’s degree from Yale University and a doctorate from the University of Pennsylvania, according to a press release. He has also written more than 80 academic ar -
ticles.
In his book, Haidt asserts that people’s intuition, rather than 
their reason, impacts the moral foundations of political posi-tions, according to the release.
This explains why people believe what they do about mor -
al, political issues, said Shelby Taylor, digital communications director at the Graham Center.
“If students take anything away from this speech, it’s recog-
nizing the danger of the hyperpartisan divide that is becoming so prevalent in this country,” Taylor said. “The demonizing of each other that consequently occurs poses a serious issue for our country.”Political psychologist to discuss moral,

Gator alumni gathered this weekend for barbecue 
and Florida football with a woman’s touch.
“It’s girl time!” said Aya Anglin, a UF alumna, as 
she nibbled on ribs.
About 150 Gator women of all ages met to cel-
ebrate football and fashion at a tailgating-themed 
expo hosted Friday by Gainesville Health & Fitness for Women.
Women lined up to sample barbecue, some dressed 
in workout clothes and others clad in orange-and-blue sundresses and 3-inch heels.
A radio blasting music by female singers set the 
mood at the gym’s Thornebrook location as partici-pants enjoyed appetizers, makeovers and gameday 
dress and jewelry displays.
“Pretty much everything you’d need for tailgat-
ing is here,” said gym employee Rachel Bennett, 28. 
“Hair, makeup, even table ideas.”
Gainesville boutiques showcased gameday trends 
with orange-and-blue dresses, jewelry and accessories for sale. For some women, tailgating is similar to host-ing a dinner party, where details ranging from per -
sonal appearance to food presentation are important, Bennett said.
Much of the displayed clothing was meant to be 
practical for hot Florida football games but still had an edge of sophistication, said Adriana Del Rosario, a 
20-year-old food science and human nutrition junior.
“There’s a lot of on-the-go fashion,” Del Rosario 
said. “Not so sporty, more upscale.”
V endor Susan Merrill said the event was a golden 
opportunity to network because it brought Gainesville 
businesswomen together.
“When women come together to support each oth-
er, it speaks volumes,” Merrill said. “We’re just help-ing each other.”Gator women

An international leader in genet-
ics research was named the new di-
rector of UF’s Genetics Institute.
Patrick Concannon will succeed 
Kenneth Berns, 74, who said that af-
ter nine years in the position, “it was time to get some fresh blood in the 
institute.”
Concannon will come to UF from 
the University of Virginia, where he currently serves as a professor of biochemistry and molecular genet-ics. He is also the associate director of the Center for Public Health Ge-
nomics at UVA and has been an af-
filiate professor of immunology at the University of Washington.
His research interests include 
cellular DNA damage responses, breast cancer genetics and the roles of genetics in Type 1 diabetes.Concannon’s interest in diabetes 
corresponds with UF, which has an international reputation for Type 1 
diabetes research, 
and its Diabetes 
Center of Excel-
lence.
“I think that 
having that kind of expertise will really strengthen our program in diabetes re-
search,” Berns said. ”I was very 
pleased to see the university go through a national search and bring 
in somebody who is well-known to become the next director.”
Concannon said he was attract-
ed to UF because of its multidisci-
plinary approach to research.
“I’m looking forward to the op-
portunity to take on the challenges 
of being the institute director,” he said. “I think there is going to be some great advancement for my own research, and I’m looking for -
ward to working with investigators with interests similar to mine.”
Concannon earned a doctorate in biology at the University of Califor -
nia, Los Angeles and is supported by more than $12 million in grants, according to a press release. His work has led to more than 150 peer-reviewed papers in top journals.
Concannon said he does not 
have an official start date at UF but 
is anticipating beginning in early 
January . For now, Interim Director Henry Baker is in charge.
Berns, who formally retired on 
June 30, remains an emeritus profes-sor and member of some medical committees.

Bros. Brawl onstage. His character, Ike, was a fan favorite be-cause players don’t usually choose him  — his killing moves 
are slow.
“We like Ike. We like Ike,” the crowd chanted.
Jesse Negron, a 20-year-old international business junior at 
Florida International University, said he likes attending tourna-
ments like GatorLAN because they’re pressure-free. “A lot of people want to get better but don’t know how,” Negron said. “The cool part for me is coming and seeing people I don’t know grow, learn and get better at the game.”Video game tournament draws gamers and viewers alike“When women come together to sup-

More than 5,800 Teach for Amer -
ica corps members began their two-
year commitments in schools na-tionwide this fall — and 78 of them are Gators.
Teach for America, an organiza-
tion that recruits qualified graduates from more than 600 campuses to teach in low-income areas, ranked UF second overall of colleges con-tributing the most graduates in 2012, according to a press release.
The University of California, 
Berkeley clinched the No. 1 spot 
with 88 members.
Last year, UF tied for fifth place 
with the University of Southern Cal-
ifornia with 75 graduates.
“The numbers are evidence 
of graduates who are committed to teaching and working to solve equality in schools,” said Teach for America UF recruitment manager 
Caity Hickey.
Hickey , who graduated from 
UF in 2009, began recruiting for the 
university last summer. In her two years as a recruiter, Hickey said 
she’s seen a decrease in applications 
but an increase in the amount of UF applicants chosen.
The average GPA for the na-
tional 2012 recruiting class was 3.54, according to the release. The 5,800 first-year corps members are scat-tered throughout 36 states.
Hickey said most UF corps mem-
bers leave Florida but prefer to stay within the southeastern U.S.
Kara Szaflarski, 22, graduated 
from UF in May with a degree in communication sciences and disor -
ders. Now she teaches pre-algebra to special education students at a middle school in New Orleans.
“I was fortunate enough to have 
a good education at UF, and I want kids to know they have the same op-tion,” Szaflarski said.
She credited Hickey for UF’s high 
numbers.
“She does a good job of getting 
the message to students,” Szaflarski said.
Although the Teach for America 
organization began in 1990, UF be-gan its formal recruiting process in 2006, Hickey said. She said she’s 
happy with the ranking.
“It’s an incredible feeling, not 
only as a recruiter, but also that this 
is my alma mater,” she said.UF ranks 
No. 2 with 
Teach For 
America memberscampus

Will Florida’s conservative offense work against other Southeastern Conference teams? Vote online at 
alligatorSports.org.Gameday Heads to Knoxville
ESPN College Gameday will be in Knoxville, Tenn., for UF’s game against Tennessee on Saturday. The show is visiting a Gators game in back-to-back weeks for the ﬁ  rst time since 2006.Brett Le Blanc / Alligator Staff
Florida quarterback Jeff Driskel (6) was sacked eight times against Texas A&M on Saturday due to a combination of questionable decision-making and porous offensive line play. 
  JOE MORGAN
 Alligator Staff Writer
   
 COLLEGE STATION, Texas — 
Texas A&M led the nation with 51 
sacks last season, and Florida failed 
to slow down the Aggies on Satur-
day. 
The Gators surrendered eight 
sacks in a 20-17 victory in their 
Southeastern Conference opener at 
Kyle Field.
  “We’ll correct it,” right guard 
James Wilson said. “We don’t know who it’s on really. Whatever it is, 
we’ll get it right so it doesn’t happen 
again.”
  In his ﬁ  rst career start at quarter-
back, Jeff Driskel completed 13 of 16 
passes — with two drops — for 162 
yards. 
However, Driskel tended to hold 
onto the ball too long in the face of an oncoming pass rush. On mul-
tiple occasions, he scrambled out of 
bounds for a loss.
  “I do think he could’ve gotten rid 
of the ball at times, but there were 
some protection issues,” Florida 
coach Will Muschamp said. “They have two good edge rushers. They led the country in sacks last year. They do have some guys that can 
rush the passer. We had a busted 
route on one sack.”  Perhaps the instance that spelled 
the most trouble for UF was a third-and-7 play on the Texas A&M 28-
yard line during the second quarter. 
Chased by Aggies defensive end Spencer Nearly, who had two sacks on Saturday, Driskel was forced out of bounds for a 5-yard loss.
  As a result, Gators kicker Caleb 
Sturgis had to attempt a 51-yard ﬁ  eld goal rather than a 46-yarder. 
  Sturgis’ ﬁ  rst try hit the right up-
right for a miss, but fortunately for Florida, Texas A&M coach Kevin Sumlin called a timeout before the play in an attempt to “ice” Sturgis. Sturgis made the second kick to cut 
the Aggies’ lead to 17-10.
  After the game, Muschamp said 
Driskel would need to work on get-
ting the ball out more quickly with 
oncoming rushers approaching.
  “No, I’m not going to live with 
that,” Muschamp said. “He needs to 
get rid of the football.”
  Sacks killed Florida’s momen-
tum on multiple offensive posses-sions. On third downs, Driskel had six rushes for negative-15 yards, including four sacks. Driskel took 
sacks on back-to-back plays to end 
two drives.
  “It’s on us,” Wilson said. “Obvi-
ously, that’s what it came down to, Driskel’s poor decisions 
result in eight sacks  
� BEHIND TYMRAK’S 
GAME-TYING GOAL, FLORIDA BEAT NEW MEXICO 3-2 ON SUNDAY IN GAINESVILLE.
  ADAM LICHTENSTEIN
 Alligator Writer
   
 Maggie Rodgers knew Eri-
ka Tymrak was going to score.
  With Florida trailing New 
Mexico 2-1 and the team in the 
locker room during a light-ning delay,   Rodgers was sure the senior midﬁ  elder would 
tie the game.  “I had this feeling,” Rod-
gers said. 
“It was like the weirdest 
thing. We were all sitting in 
the   training room, and I was like ‘Oh my gosh, Erika’s go-ing to score.’ 
“[I] went up to her, told her 
it maybe   like eight times, until she was like ‘OK, I get it Mag-gie, I’m going to score.’”
  Rodgers ended up being 
right. 
About a minute after the 
game restarted, Tymrak turned a pass from   Annie Bob-
bitt into Florida’s second goal 
of the day.
  The Gators would add a goal from Holly King in the 66th minute and defeated the 
Lobos 3-2 on Sunday   after-
noon in James G. Pressly Sta-dium in Gainesville.
The Gators improve to 3-2-
1 with the win in advance of 
Friday’s matchup with Ken-
tucky in Lexington.
  Florida’s defense struggled 
early in the match.
  All-America defender 
Kathryn Williamson missed Sunday’s game and will be out indeﬁ  nitely due to   a torn right meniscus, according to coach 
Becky Burleigh.
  “[Williamson] is such a Rodgers’ vision realized in UF win  THE ADAM BOMB
COLLEGE STATION, Texas
Will Muschamp walked 
into his post-game press conference drip-
ping sweat with a white towel wrapped around his neck. He looked worn out from another close game. 
  For the second week in a row, 
Florida entered the fourth quar-ter with the game’s outcome still in doubt.
  Being boring isn’t easy, but it 
works.
  “I know I got killed for last 
week, but there’s a reason why we did it, because we had a supe-rior foot-ball team 
than  
Bowling  Green,”  Mus-c h a m p 
s a i d . 
“Noth-
ing against those guys, but we needed to play that way in order 
to play that way this week in this 
ballgame.”

twitter: @pincus_adamit came time for the Gators to play hard-
nosed football, they were ready. And if they want to be a winning team in the SEC, they’ll 
need to be. 
“This is kind of who we are,” Muschamp 
said. “I know nobody wants to hear that, but 
that’s the facts of life. Sometimes you’ve got 
to put your realistic glasses on and see who 
you are.”
Who the Gators were last year was a soft, 
weak bunch unable to handle the grind of a full season. 
Muschamp hopes this year’s group is en-
tirely different, and Saturday’s come-from-behind effort is a step toward that goal. 
“I don’t even remember the last game we 
won from behind, actually, in my six years,” guard James Wilson said. “Usually we don’t win when we’re down.”
Texas A&M took a 10-point lead with 7:01 
remaining in the second quarter on Christine 
Michael’s 1-yard touchdown run. 
The Aggies’ offense dominated the first 30 minutes behind redshirt freshman quarter -
back Johnny Manziel. At halftime, Manziel was 16-of-20 for 141 yards, plus nine carries 
for 41 yards and a score. Texas A&M’s offense ran 46 first-half plays, amassing 17 points and 269 yards without having to punt.
Facing a quarterback and offense no one 
had ever seen before at the college level, Florida’s defensive linemen were trying to make plays in the backfield, which opened up running lanes for the mobile Manziel. 
“There was no magic potion,” Muschamp 
said. “It was crystal clear. At halftime, I told them, ‘I’m firing you if you run up the field again. Sit on the line of scrimmage, squeeze blocks inside of you and quit running up the 
field.’” 
The Gators took that message to heart, 
forcing three-and-outs on four of the Aggies 
first five second-half possessions. 
Texas A&M averaged 5.8 yards per play 
in the first half and only 2.8 yards per play in the second. 
Jeff Driskel was sacked eight times but 
completed 13 of 16 passes for 162 yards, while Mike Gillislee ran 14 times for 83 yards and both Gators touchdowns. 
 “It was just winning the line of scrim-
mage,” linebacker Jon Bostic said. “We weren’t playing like we wanted to in the first half. Once we made those adjustments, we were back to playing Florida football.”
Back to grinding it out, back to controlling 
the line of scrimmage and back to winning.

Gillislee carried 14 times 
for 83 yards and two scores against Texas A&M. Although he likely 
won’t reach his lofty goals of 1,500 yards and 24 touchdowns, his 231 yards, 6.1 yards per carry average and four touchdowns in the season’s first two games make those numbers seem 
feasible. 
Florida 20, Texas A&M 17
With Florida’s offense sputtering and the Gators down by 4 in the fourth quarter, Jeff Driskel 
found Omarius Hines on a corner route for a 39-yard gain down to Texas A&M’s 18-yard line. Mike Gillislee scored two plays later to give the Gators a lead they would never relinquish. 65

Facing fourth-and-1 on their opening 
drive, the Gators faked a field goal as holder John Crofoot tossed to Trey Burton for a 3-yard gain and a first down. Gillislee scored two plays later 
to give UF a 7-3 lead.  With Florida down by 10 and Texas A&M seemingly moving the ball at will, Caleb Sturgis drilled a 51-yard field goal to bring the Gators within 7 heading into halftime. Sturgis’ 
first attempt clanged off the right upright, but he re-ceived a second opportunity when it was ruled that Texas A&M had called timeout before the play. On Texas A&M’s first drive of the second half, Marcus Roberson tack -
led Mike Evans short of the sticks to force a three-and-out. Roberson’s play forced the Aggies’ first punt of 
the game and set the tone for the second half. Brett Le Blanc / Alligator Staff

FOOTBALL , from page 1and that’s what it’s going to be a lot. If 
you want to be dominant in the SEC, you have to have a solid offensive line. We’re 
ready to take on the challenge.”
The Gators averaged 3 yards per carry 
on the way to 142 yards in the ground 
game on Saturday. 
They lost 48 yards on eight sacks and 9 
yards on two kneel-downs on the game’s 
final two plays.
Subtract the sacks, and Florida aver -
aged 4 yards per carry for 190 yards.
Despite the loss of significant yardage 
on Saturday, Muschamp did not condemn 
sacks.
“He took care of the ball,” Muschamp 
said of Driskel. 
“He didn’t try to make a throw. He ate 
the ball. There’s good sacks, too. There’s nothing wrong with ending a series with a punt. I know that’s not allowed to be 
said at Florida, but there’s nothing wrong 
with that, alright? There’s some positives in that.”
UF will try to minimize sacks against 
Tennessee in Knoxville, Tenn., next week-end. 
Last season, the Volunteers ranked 
second-to-last in the SEC and 107th na-tionally with just 15 sacks.
“Don’t put it on one guy for a sack,” 
Muschamp said. “There’s a lot of differ -ent things that go into a sack.”

Florida running back Mike Gillislee (left) ran for 83 yards and two scores on Saturday 
against Texas A&M. Minus eight sacks, the Gators ran for 190 yards. 
Aside from sacks, Florida rushing game thrives
great player and such a big loss for 
our team, so there’s such big shoes to fill,” said Bobbitt, who filled in for 
Williamson on the back line.
The Gators defense made a costly 
error early in the game, trying to 
cross the ball through its own pen-
alty box. 
New Mexico midfielder Rachel 
Montoya intercepted the cross and 
scored the game’s first goal.
“We played a part in the goals 
New Mexico scored,” Burleigh said. “Credit them for finishing them with efficiency, but we’ve just got to be a little bit better about not giving 
away free chanc-es.”
On offense, 
Florida missed 
out on  several opportunities early 
in the game.
Tymrak had a shot deflected in 
the eighth minute, and junior Adri-
ana Leon fired a shot that hit off the 
post in the 35th minute. 
The Gators ended the first half 
with six shots but had not registered 
a shot on goal.
Sophomore Annie Speese tied the 
game at 1 four minutes into the sec-ond half, but the Lobos pulled back ahead seven minutes later.
The real spark in Florida’s offense 
came after the game was delayed 50 minutes due to lightning.
Tymrak tied the game in the 60th 
minute, and then King delivered the winning goal on a header off a free 
kick from Jo Dragotta.
“It’s a big win,” King said. “We 
didn’t exactly play the way that 
we wanted to play, but it’s a good 
win before going into [Southeastern 
Conference] play, and we’ll be ready by then.”DRISKEL , from page 13
SOCCER , from page 13UF offense 
struggles in first half, surges late
a “game manager” got the job 
done.
This isn’t your fun ‘n’ gun 
or spread-option offense. This is old-school Southeastern Conference football.
“We’re going to have a lot 
of games like this now,” Mus-champ said. “That’s just who we are. We’re going to grind it out. We’re going to win, and that’s what we kind of are as a 
mentality as a football team as 
we continue to grow and ma-ture through the year.”
Whether the Gators can 
bully teams to victory re-mains unclear. UF played an outmatched Mid-American Conference team and an A&M squad playing its first game 
with a new coaching staff.
Right now, UF looks like 
the 11-year-old who picks on 
the second-graders. Grinding against teams like Georgia and LSU is unrealistic personnel-wise, but the Gators have the attitude down pat.
When Florida was down 
by 10 with seven minutes left in the second quarter, there wasn’t any panic on the side-lines. 
The Gators knew their ob-
jective in College Station — win the fourth quarter.
Depth hurt the Gators in 
2011, and Muschamp said they 
might not have won this type 
of game last season.
Redshirt senior left guard 
James Wilson, the elder states-
man, doesn’t remember a time 
winning from behind in his six years at Florida.
Until Saturday, the Gators 
hadn’t rallied from a halftime 
deficit in five tries under Mus-
champ.
Florida generated nine min-
utes of offense in the fourth quarter, including running out the clock for the final three.
“We wanted to pound the 
ball,” right guard Jon Halapio said. “We wanted to run out 
the clock, and we definitely 
wanted to gas the other side of the line of scrimmage.”
The Gators gained 44 yards 
on six straight rush attempts by Driskel, Mack Brown, and Solomon Patton to end the game. 
“Happiest moment in Flor -
ida history for me — that and the Ohio State game,” Mus-champ said. 
If the Gators are to have 
more satisfying wins in 2012, running back Mike Gillislee has to stay healthy. 
He left the game after an 
apparent groin injury follow-
ing his fourth-quarter touch-
down.
Gillislee has four touch-
downs, and UF running backs have 52 more rush attempts 
than the quarterbacks have 
pass attempts.
It isn’t pretty, and some-
times, it’s downright ugly.
“I told the guys at the end 
of the game, ‘We’re going to have to win some games like that this year. This is kind of who we are,’” Muschamp said. 
“I know nobody wants to hear 
that, but that’s the facts of life. Sometimes you’ve got to put your realistic glasses on and 
see who you are.”
Being boring will fly on 
only one condition coach — if 
you win.

UF coach� LINEBACKER LEFT IN THE FIRST 
QUARTER AND DID NOT RETURN.

COLLEGE STATION, Texas — Although 
the Gators opened Southeastern Conference 
play with a win Saturday , the physical toll it took on UF was immense. 
Amid a bunch of minor tweaks and 
cramps, the injury that appeared most serious was to the thumb of starting linebacker Jelani Jenkins, who left the game in the first quarter and returned to the sidelines in street clothes with his arm in a sling. Muschamp said after the game that he did not know the extent of the injury, but that Jenkins’ thumb had to be put into a cast.
When asked how the defense would fare if 
it had to play without Jenkins for an extended period of time, Jon Bostic expressed confidence in the other linebackers on the roster.
“It’s a big loss,” Bostic said, “but there’s 
some guys in this program that can play be-hind him. Antonio (Morrison), Mike Taylor, even (Darrin) Kitchens (can) move inside. We’ve got some depth at the linebacker posi-tion too, where a lot of guys can play all differ -ent types of positions.”
Play was stopped numerous times in 
Florida’s 20-17 win over Texas A&M as sev-eral Gators went down with cramps and other 
injuries. Muschamp was even forced to use 
players in unusual packages, leading to a tim-eout before a punt attempt.
“We lost a bunch of guys in the game,” 
Muschamp said. “We were down to our third 
gunner at one point on punt return. I had to 
take a timeout to make sure the young man knew what to do. I wasn’t sure he knew, and I would rather take the timeout and make sure he knew exactly what we were supposed to do in that situation.”
Right tackle Chaz Green, defensive tackle 
Sharrif Floyd, cornerback Marcus Roberson and Buck linebacker Lerentee McCray were 
among a large group of Gators who had to 
leave the game due to cramps.
“It was cooler than it’s been,” Muschamp 
said of the weather’s effect on cramps. “It’s a dryer heat. I didn’t know we would have is-sues with cramps.”
Florida also suffered a handful of more sig-
nificant injuries.
Junior defensive back Cody Riggs left the 
game with a sprained foot, and starting free safety Josh Evans left the game with an undis-closed shoulder injury . 
Running back Mike Gillislee, who finished 
with 83 rushing yards and two touchdowns, left the game in the fourth quarter. Muschamp said he did not know what Gillislee’s injury was.
