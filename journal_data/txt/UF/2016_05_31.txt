Editor’s note: This story contains 
graphic details.
At a crossroads in northern 
Uganda, locals and travelers are met 
by 28 names on a memorial. 
Stacey Nelson, a former standout 
softball player at UF, said she gradu-ated in 2009 and saw the memorial in Uganda about two years later. 
Nelson said she encountered 
stories and people that brought her back to Uganda in April and will likely bring her back in the fall.
At the memorial, a tour guide 
told the story of how the Lord’s Re-sistance Army kidnapped 28 people and took them to the crossroads, where they would soon be pushed into a hole of smouldering charcoal. 
After the murders, soldiers pro-
ceeded to desecrate the captives’ bodies and use them to spread fear, Nelson said.
“That was the mindset of this 
army: Just strike terror into people and kill or be killed,” she said.
She originally made the 2011 trip 
to answer one question: How did 
the chaos affect the availability of 
jobs? 
By the time she was forced to 
leave, she was determined to make sure the availability of jobs would never be in question again. Nelson was ﬁ  rst drawn to Africa 
by its aura of mystery.
Dreams of visiting the coun-
try began during her years at Los Alamitos High School in Southern California, Nelson said, and the de-sire only grew with time.
“The mysterious, the awe-inspir-
ing, the forbidden fortress that was ‘Africa’ kept glowing in my mind,” she wrote in an entry on her blog “Stacey-san goes to Uganda.”
When she wasn’t busy becom-
ing the most decorated pitcher in UF softball history, amassing the most career wins (136), most ca-reer strikeouts (1,116) and lowest career ERA (0.99) of any player to ever wear orange and blue stirrups, Nelson could be found studying in the classroom. 
As a philosophy major, Nelson 
said she was particularly interested in existentialism. 
As she deﬁ  nes it, existentialism 
is “the theory of why people are here on Earth,” and Nelson chose to spend her time on Earth as a helper. 
In college, she volunteered for 
a basketball team comprised of children with disabilities at Gaines-
ville’s Sidney Lanier Center.
With the help of UF history pro-
fessor Steven Noll, who coaches the 
basketball team, Nelson explored 
the issues facing Africa and its child 
soldiers. Former UF softball player seeks to improve 
Ugandan lives, economic opportunities
ABOUT 100 VETERANS 
AND THEIR RELATIVES 
ATTENDED THE EVENT 
ON MONDA Y.
By Anna Jackson
Alligator Contributing Writer
After serving in the Army’s 
101st Airborne Division, Staff Sgt. 
Fred Hart died of health complica-tions in 2008.
Sisters Faye Bush and Sue Hart 
then buried their father in the For-est Meadows Military Garden of Honor, where about 100 veter-ans and family members gathered Monday.
Bush said her father earned a 
World War II Victory Medal and the European-African-Middle East-ern Campaign Medal before he re-
turned on a ship called the Queen 
Mary. 
“When (the cemetery) started 
the military part, he wanted to be in that part because he was very proud of his service,” Hart said. 
Master of ceremonies Bob Gas-
che, a U.S. Marine Corps veteran who fought at Iwo Jima, said he 
started speaking at the event about 
seven years ago.
In between several ceremonial 
traditions, Gasche honored the vet-erans who are now buried at the cemetery.
“It’s such a privilege to recog-
nize that and to let people know we owe them everything,” he said, 
“because they gave us everything.”
Vickie Van Buren, the com-
mander of the American Legion 
Post 16, said she was satisﬁ  ed with the turnout. 
 “Every year, it gets a little big-
ger, and it proves to me that people don’t see this as a day to go to the beach and picnic,”  said Van Buren, 
a chair on the County Veterans Ad-
visory Board. “They see it as what it’s supposed to be: to honor our fallen.”  Cemetery

Health officials now confirm 11 
cases of measles in Arizona 
ELOY, Ariz. (AP) — An out-
break of measles that began with an inmate at a federal de-tention center for immigrants in central Arizona has now grown to 11 confirmed cases, officials said Monday.
Seven of those infected are in-
mates at the Eloy Detention 
Center, and four are workers at 
the facility, Pinal County Health Services spokesman Joe Pyritz said. The privately-run facility has stopped accepting new de-tainees or releasing those cur-
rently held there.
State and county health officials 
said they're working to stop 
new transmissions by isolating 
patients, vaccinating people de-tained in the privately-run facil-ity and trying to identify people 
who were at locations the four 
infected workers visited.The outbreak began when an 
infected inmate was brought 
to the facility and spread the 
disease to a worker, who had been vaccinated but caught the disease anyway. Health officials put out the first warning of the initial two cases last Thursday.
Health officials have identi-
fied 14 locations in Pinal and Maricopa counties where the infected workers may have ex-posed other people, including stores, restaurants and a tribal casino. The list is posted here: 1.usa.gov/1OYMzYh.The Arizona Department of Health Services is working with 
county officials to try to identify 
people exposed outside the fa-cility. They're also urging peo-ple who may have visited any of the identified locations to come forward and be alert to measles symptoms, which include fever, red, watery eyes, cough and runny nose and is followed by a rash that is red, raised and 
blotchy. The rash begins on the 
face at the hairline and moves down the body and may last five to six days."People who have a rash and fever must call their health care provider or emergency depart-
ment before going to let them 
know they may have measles," Dr. Cara Christ, the director of the state health department, said in a statement. "It is vital to help stop the further spread of the disease."HIGH  93° LOW  68°

The ﬁ  rst 10 participants who 
attend a toxic waste collection 
Wednesday will receive free tickets to see “The Toxic Avenger” at the Hippodrome State Theatre.
The Hippodrome has partnered 
with the Alachua County Environ-mental Protection Department’s 
Hazardous Waste Collection Cen-
ter to collect hazardous waste from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. in the parking lot at the corner of Southeast Second 
Place and Southeast First Street.
All event participants can pur-
chase discounted tickets for $10 each to see the play within the ﬁ  rst 
10 days of showings. “The show is a musical comedy 
set in a toxic waste dump off the New Jersey turnpike,” said Mark Sexton, the Alachua County com-munications and legislative affairs 
director. “It ties right into what 
we’re trying to do here.”
The collection will accept items 
such as car batteries, paints, pills 
and light bulbs. “All of our drinking water comes 
from an aquifer,” said Kurt Seaburg, the hazardous waste coordinator at the Hazardous Waste Collection Center. “If you don’t properly dis-
pose of the hazardous materials that 
we collect, they have the potential to contaminate our groundwater.”
The collection center, located at 
5125 NE. 63rd Ave., collects about 1.5 million pounds of waste each 
year, Seaburg said.
“We like to do things that are 
win-win-win,” said Jessica Hurov, the managing director of the Hippo-drome. “It’s a win for the environ-ment, it’s a win for the participants 
and it’s a win for the Hippodrome, 
because we get to spread the word 
about our play.”  Bring waste, see ‘The Toxic Avenger’ at the Hippodrome
It was a subject the duo knew lit-
tle about, but an independent study 
course provided an opportunity to 
feed their curiosity.
Nelson went on to study law at 
Loyola Marymount University, and she now works to improve jails in Los Angeles County, California.
Nelson’s professor said her am-
bition for learning was equal to her passion for playing softball.
“She was different than most ath-
letes in that she was academically in-quisitive… She was more than good 
in class,” Noll said.Before she ﬁ  rst visited Uganda, 
Nelson played professional softball 
in Japan.
Her afﬁ  nity for the landlocked Af-
rican nation eventually outweighed 
her love of softball, and a microﬁ  -
nance and social entrepreneurship program brought her there in 2011. 
“It’s the place I want; it’s the sub-
ject I want,” Nelson remembered thinking to herself. “Goodbye profes-sional softball, I’m going.”
She arrived in northern Uganda 
and worked with Friends of Or-
phans, which trains former child 
soldiers and orphans to ﬁ  nd employ-
ment.
The goal,  Nelson said, was to 
study the organization’s alumni and determine if they were ﬁ  nding jobs. 
The results were grim. Disheartened but not discour-
aged, Nelson channeled a do-more spirit that professor Noll said is all 
too familiar.
“She’s always looking in a posi-
tive way to try and see how things can be better, both for the people 
that she’s looking at and also for her-
self,” Noll said. From the ashes of her study, the 
Hope Bread Factory was born.
Located in Pader Town Council 
in northern Uganda, the factory will employ several dozen people after its completion, Nelson said. 
The factory, she said, will hope-
fully create more than 100 jobs by 
helping the region make its own 
bread and allowing farmers to begin 
growing wheat. 
However, Joseph Kony — the 
subject of the “most viral video in history,” according to Time maga-zine — previously used the land to 
recruit children for his army and co-ordinate a devastating civil war. 
Kony’s soldiers would ask peo-
ple if they wanted to laugh, Nelson 
wrote on her blog. If someone said 
no, their lips were sewn shut, leav-ing them unable to laugh. If someone 
said yes, their lips were cut off, leav-
ing them with a permanent “smile.” 
It becomes hard to count how 
many people watched their family 
die or how many people were forced 
to kill their own family, Nelson said.
Hopefully, she said, the factory 
will help heal their wounds. 
“They’re still not getting access to 
such basic things (like education and healthcare),” Nelson said, “and yet, they are so resilient, they’re so giv-ing, they’re so smart and hardwork-ing.”
“What would you do if (Kony) 
ever came back?” Nelson remembers 
asking a group of locals. 
Nelson said the answer epito-
mized her motivation for visiting Uganda.
“Everyone simultaneously looked 
at me and answered, ‘We would for-
give him,’” she said. “We’re Chris-tians.”
Ugandans often focus on the 
community rather than themselves, she said. Nelson’s friend Geoffrey re-cently offered her four acres of land 
and a hut.  
Nelson plans to accept Geoffrey’s 
proposal and return to Africa by the 
end of 2016. Though she can’t give 
up American beer and family forev-
er, Nelson will stay in Uganda until it 
feels right to leave, she said.
“I don’t know why I have such 
a strong calling to go there and stay there, but it’s an undeniable calling 
— something I’m so certain of,” she 
said.

Members of B3 Gym and the 
Gainesville community shed blood, 
sweat and tears in memory of Sgt. 
Jonathan Cote and Lt. Michael Murphy on Memorial Day.
About 40 people completed the 
Murph Challenge, named after the lieutenant who died in combat and 
favored the workout. The full ex-
ercise consists of two miles of run-ning, 100 pull-ups, 200 push-ups 
and 300 squats.
Chris “Boris” Marhefka owns B3 Gym, located at 1527 NW. Sixth Street. Marhefka said he has com-
pleted the Murph Challenge four times and raised more than $1,000 
each year in Jonathan Cote’s mem-
ory. 
Cote, who was Marhefka’s fra-
ternity brother in Sigma Phi Epsi-lon at UF, died after being held cap-tive in Iraq for 522 days, beginning 
in November 2006.
Marhefka, 30, started the Jon 
Cote Memorial Scholarship to pre -
serve the memory of “someone 
who was willing to help others 
first,” he said.Cote returned to school after 
serving in the 82nd Airborne Divi-sion in the Army. His story fueled 
Marhefka’s idea to give money to veterans going to college for their 
first semesters, particularly those 
attending Santa Fe College and UF.
Funded by philanthropies, 
Cote’s family and friends and the Greek community at UF, the schol-arship gives winners $1,500 to 
bridge the gap between the start 
of school and the time veterans receive benefits from the G.I. Bill, 
Marhefka said. The G.I. Bill pro-
vides service members with money to pay for tuition, housing and oth-er fees while they attend college.  
B3 Gym’s Memorial Day Murph 
Challenge will raise more than $1,000 for the scholarship this 
year, he said.
Jennifer Sager, a 40-year-old 
member of B3 Gym and a veteri-nary nurse at UF, donated $25 to 
attempt the challenge in honor of her friends and family who served 
in the military. 
“It’s about completing the 
workout today no matter how long it takes,” Sager said. 
Katherine Martinez-Malo, a 41-year-old high school teacher, 
wore a boot on her injured foot 
while doing the challenge.
“This place inspires me,” she 
said. “This boot is just one more obstacle that I can overcome; that’s 
what this place has taught me.” 
The gym was filled with cheers 
of encouragement from those watching on the sidelines as com-petitors found their breath and 
willpower.
“(Cote) would probably have 
something to say to us: ‘Just keep serving and helping people,’” Mar-
hefka said.Fallen heroes remembered with Memorial Day workout

a sobering reminder 
of then and now
On Friday, President Barack Obama made a remarkably his-
toric visit to Hiroshima, Japan, calling for a “moral revolu-
tion” and a “world without nuclear weapons” in his ad-
dress. If this rhetoric sounds at all familiar, that’s because, 
well, it is.
Three months into his presidency, in 2009 (many of us were in 
middle or early high school. Time ﬂ  ies so quickly!), Obama stood before a crowd in Prague and said, “So today, I state clearly and 
with conviction America’s commitment to seek the peace and se-
curity of a world without nuclear weapons,” to which the crowd 
applauded and the Norwegian Nobel Committee decided on a new peace prize laureate.
Now, seven years later, we can look back at our country’s 
nuclear developments and determine whether Obama’s words in 
Prague and in Hiroshima stand true. Unfortunately, the answer is no, they haven’t. In fact, his administration and the Pentagon cur-
rently push a nuclear modernization program set to cost $1 trillion over the next three decades.  
Publicly, the Obama administration argues these costs are nec-
essary to revitalize the infrastructure and operating systems of the 
nuclear storage and deployment sites. Anyone who’s seen the epic 
“Last Week Tonight with John Oliver” video is well aware of our 
haphazardly managed nuclear facilities, some of which still use 
ﬂ  oppy disks on computers that look like they could barely run the 1970s version of Pong.
In reality, though, the justiﬁ  cation for this new modernization 
effort reﬂ  ects a new post-Crimea strategy against Russia and a 
degree of political dealing. The budget proposal for the 2017 ﬁ  s-
cal year speciﬁ  cally highlights how the budget allows for the De-
partment of Defense to “modernize our nuclear arsenal” within 
a broader effort to combat Russian aggression in Eastern Europe.
And while the efforts are framed in terms of modernization 
and justiﬁ  ed with the crumbling infrastructure of our nuclear sites, which is in itself a serious issue, much of the costs of this initiative 
relate to expansions of weapons themselves: We’re talking about 
12 new missile submarines, up to 100 new bombers and 400 land-
based missiles, either new or refurbished, according to The New 
York Times.
Even the hawk and “maverick” Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., 
called the initiative “very, very, very expensive,” and further asked 
if we “really need the entire Triad,” referring to the land, sea and 
air-based deployment methods for nukes. 
This whole nuclear business is yet another example of how 
Obama will say one thing in front of the microphone, while pursu-ing literally the exact opposite agenda behind closed doors.
And it’s not just nukes: He stands before the nation in his State 
of the Union addresses and calls for comprehensive immigration 
reform, while simultaneously earning the title “deporter-in-chief” 
from Latino advocacy groups like the National Council on La Raza.  
For however much you may like the president — and there’s a lot 
to appreciate about him — this discrepancy between action and rhetoric is something we must hold him accountable for.
“We are not bound… to repeat the mistakes of the past. We 
can learn. We can choose.” We at the Alligator would encourage 
Obama to heed his words from Hiroshima. We know congressio-
nal obstructionism and current international military challenges re-ally do not bode well for the prospect of peace currently, but right 
now, this initiative is akin to a Cold War-era arms race.
We need to be vigilant in our efforts, concerted in our imple-
mentation. We need to be able to look at the prospect of nuclear non-proliferation and say those three words it seems we’ve long 
forgotten: “Yes, we can.”
Body-shaming, hypocrisy and Sriracha sauce
Like any good writer in the 21st century, the 
controversial topics I address are inspired 
directly from what I see on social media. 
Based on that alone, this week I was forced to decide between three things: whether Hill-
ary Clinton’s lying habits are worse than Donald Trump’s, those one-minute cooking videos that always end with that one dude making sex noises 
to the image of food — “oh ye-AH!” — or some 
asshole at the gym again.
According to the comments section from my 
previous articles, anytime I write about politics, I’m wrong and also embody Hitler and Marx (who had mutually exclu-sive political ideologies: C’mon, comments section). More-
over, anytime I try to make that “fried-pickle-shrimp-scam-
pi-lasagna-cookie-gasm” delight with a side of hummus and guacamole, I burn it and end up making myself what I call 
Ol’ Faithful: Froot Loops. So strap in, the seven of you Gators 
still here for Summer A (and conservative Gator alumni who still read, and even comment on, student newspapers like a 
bunch of nostalgic has-beens), because we’re going to tackle 
the issue of body image, today.
The most common headline I see on the side of that Face-
book sidebar news thing is almost always related to penises. I now know a man had his penis bitten by a snake in Thailand, and the ﬁ  rst penis transplant was successful. Unfortunately 
for the former dude, those are separate stories.
Now, the second most popular headline is about some 
outdated C-list celebrity who bravely posed nude on some even less famous magazine and how he or she is “silencing 
body-shamers.” Like most issues that only have two sides, both are embarrassing themselves with their polarizing opin-
ions.
When a celebrity poses nude on a magazine, they’re called 
“brave.” When I do it, I get arrested and can’t legally trick-or-treat (‘tis a joke; I even shower with a pixelated rectangle 
around my genitals). There is nothing “brave” about that at all. Any sense of “empowerment” derived from what is clear-
ly nothing more than shameless attention-grabbing is exactly the same empowerment creepy men in parking 
lots wearing nothing but brown trench coats get 
when they expose themselves to passersby at wee 
hours of the night. If anything, these magazine features are just a pathetic attempt to stay relevant 
and to capitalize and proﬁ  t off of a generation that 
probably has enough hubris already.  I don’t know if body-shaming is the cause of this phenomenon 
or the result of it: Both seem possible. Regardless, 
the opposite end of this spectrum is just as guilty of perpetuating bad logic.
Now it goes without saying America suffers from an obe-
sity epidemic. There are too many factors at play here. Of-tentimes, it has to do with genetics, but it also involves being 
raised with poor eating habits, horrible health education pro-
grams (in terms of diet and even physical education) in pub-lic schools and, of course, Sriracha sauce making everything 
taste like ambrosia. But the reality is no obese person is en-
tirely responsible for his or her condition. More importantly, unless you’re a certiﬁ  ed medical professional able to discuss 
such health conditions with the seriousness, delicateness and 
understanding obese people deserve, it literally isn’t your job to remind them. It also isn’t your job to harass these people 
to the point of making them break down or emotionally re-
spond, with intensity, to their conditions.
Plus, body-shamers have unreasonable standards. Even 
people who are of average weight are shamed. During Spring Break this year I was called “chubby” by an acquaintance. One, we were talking about sports. Two, I don’t know why 
you would think it’s appropriate to say that anyway. Three, 
I’m literally 13 pounds underweight, Steven, you dumbass. Thankfully, my Jewish grandmother constantly reminds me 
I look skinny (Baruch atah adonai for a healthy metabolism).
Listen, dear reader, my point should be abundantly clear 
by now: You’re not brave for being naked, and you’re not helping by embarrassing people. Love the skin you’re in and 
do everything you can to keep your body healthy.

So, let’s talk about The Don-
ald. Let’s not talk about his obscene, blanket remarks labeling illegal immigrants as criminals bent on de-
stroying society or the fact he thinks Islam somehow has a ha-tred for the U.S. that nobody else can see. Rather, let’s talk about the fact he can make his massive me-dia attention devoid of any actual news to work to his advantage.
The media’s love fest with Donald Trump 
should not be all that shocking. The media, 
like any other business, needs a profit, and 
the media can only do that by gaining rat-ings and sponsors. No one can put eyeballs to television screens like a celebrity mogul who says whatever he wants.
Where media outlets fail to knock Trump 
down just like any other candidate is their inability to get him to answer a question in a straightforward manner. Whenever the al-
phabet soup of an answer comes out of The 
Donald’s mouth without any real coherence, the interviewer will usually go onto the next question without posing much resistance.
However, it goes beyond blaming the me-
dia, because Trump himself is playing the networks like a finely tuned violin, especially last week with him clogging the news cycle with nearly every Clinton family controversy 
that ever graced a 1990s newspaper, along 
with new attacks against Sen. Elizabeth War-ren, D-Mass. They gave him multiple hours of coverage on the 24-hour news cycle.More importantly, these attacks 
were the kind Trump thoroughly enjoys because it gave him control of the conversation once again. In Trump’s campaign, not all news is 
good news. For example, Trump 
in the news cycle for refusing to disclose his tax returns is not-so-good news. It puts Trump on the defensive side, a place he doesn’t want to be no matter how much of 
a “counterpuncher” he claims he is. 
This is how Trump utilizes the media 
to his advantage: a smokescreen to distract 
from the continual and justified criticisms 
about his policies he wishes to create if he were to reach the presidency. It is much eas-ier attacking Hillary Clinton or a prominent GOP official than discussing the details of his plan to build a wall across the southern border.
Instead, we are stuck with a smokescreen 
of shallowness where none of the issues can 
be discussed. Even Trump’s issues of im-
migration take a backseat to the insults and conspiracy theories being thrown around by the candidate. 
Right now, the only person it is benefitting 
is Trump, and until the media learns how to approach him differently, we will continue to face news cycles clogged with anything but actual prescriptions on how to make America 
greater than it already is.

opinions@alligator.orgCollege is more about 
learning than getting good grades. I was given this advice at orientation by a professor whose class I’m 
currently bombing, so I hope he’s right.
While I may not have put in 
the elbow grease to keep my GPA up, I have put in a couple hundred hours watching sports. Does that compen-sate for anything? Have I “learned” anything from watching sports, and, more important-
ly, do they have the ability to make me, or 
the average person, smarter?
I believe they do, but I think an im-
portant distinction should be made. Being 
smart about sports is different than becom-
ing smarter because of them. In the current 
age of analytics, media coverage has gotten 
increasingly brainy, but this is the opposite 
of my concern. The majority of analytic ex-perts were bright long before they took the 
deep dive into pick-and-rolls. The bigger 
question is whether you can get intelligence out of sports themselves.
What I’m suggesting is watching a game 
could make someone more capable of think-ing critically in the same way as a nuanced 
album or an Aaron Sorkin movie. While 
neither of these things will make someone 
as smart as reading a textbook or traveling the world, they’re not completely mindless activities either.
Take Radiohead’s album, “Kid 
A.” People marvel at that record because it sounds beautiful, and it makes them think: What is 
Radiohead saying here? Why is 
the band saying it? In that same breath, you say similar things about a beautifully run offense: Why does this work? Why hasn’t 
it been done before?
Great albums and sports share the kind 
of nuance that comes with doing something 
well. There are thousands of people who 
coach basketball in the world, and Gregg Popovich of the Spurs is widely considered 
the best. If a Spurs' play is an extension of 
his thought process, and he thinks about 
basketball better than anyone, just watch-
ing it feels like it would have some mental 
substance. It seems reasonable that a good 
amount of learning may come from watch-ing smart people do things they’re smart at 
doing.
This is all theoretical. But I'm holding 
out hope. I do believe there’s an aspect of 
observing competition that hasn’t been fully 
appreciated yet. There’s a spark of some-
thing separating a competitive sport from 
an iPhone game. I write for the sports page 
— I’d like to think so.

Donald originally ran in The Daily Bruin.What we learn from watching sports UWire

Brooke Austin and Kourtney 
Keegan captured Florida's first 
doubles national title since 2001 on Monday. Read the story on pg. 14. By Patrick Pinak
Sports Writer
One error was all it took.
Florida third baseman Jona-
than India botched a tailor-made double play that would’ve ended the seventh inning and kept UF’s 
5-3 lead in check.
The Gators might have held 
on and hoisted their second con-
secutive Southeastern Conference Tournament trophy.
Instead, Texas A&M scored 
four runs in the frame and went on to defeat the Gators (47-13) 12-5 on Sunday to capture the Ag-gies’ first SEC Tournament Cham-pionship in Hoover, Alabama.
“We had a chance to finish the 
inning there and it didn’t hap-pen,” UF assistant coach Brad Weitzel said. “Sometimes against a good team you only get one 
shot. That might’ve been it.”
Despite the loss, Florida 
earned a No. 1 national seed in 
the NCAA Tournament and will 
host the first round of Region-
als from Friday to Monday at McKethan Stadium. This year’s Regional marks UF coach Kevin O’Sullivan’s seventh time earning 
a national seed.
UF will play Bethune Cookman 
at 6 p.m. on Friday. The Wildcats 
won the Mid-Eastern Athletic 
Conference Championship on 
May 24 with a 1-0 win over Nor-folk State. 
The winner will play the win-
ner of Connecticut and Georgia 
Tech at 6 p.m. on Saturday, while 
the losers play each other at noon on Saturday.
The winner of the Gainesville 
Regional will advance to face the winner of the Tallahassee Region-al next weekend.

Florida falls in SEC title, earns No. 1 seed in NCAAs
UF plays Bethune Cookman on Friday
By Alfredo Morales
Sports Writer
Florida concluded its 2015-
16 season on May 23. It was a 
season that featured dominant 
victories, record-breaking perfor-
mances and post-season short-comings.
Coach Emily Glaser led the 
Gators to seven wins this season — the most since 1986. 
But UF’s Fall season didn’t 
start out as planned.
While then-No. 22 UF explod-
ed in its season-opener — land-ing fourth in a stacked field that included then-No. 9 Arkansas — it did not find a title until the 
Alamo Invitational on Oct. 27.
Continuing their momentum from that Invitational, the Gators swept the Florida Challenge on 
Feb. 1 with a 12-stroke victory.
Florida claimed third place at 
the Northrop Grumman Regional Challenge, a notable improve-
ment from its 10th-place finish 
last season. 
Continuing its dominant run, 
UF collected four-straight titles, 
ending the regular season with 
six wins.
In her fourth year, Glaser had 
collected more wins than in her past three years combined.
Unfortunately, the Gators 
were unable to take their win-streak into the beginning post-season, finishing in second after 
a fierce battle with the Alabama 
Crimson Tide at the Southeast-ern Conference Championship on April 17.
Florida came back with force 
at the NCAA Regional Champi-onship, though.
UF began the tournament in 
fourth place and opened the last 
round in third, but a program-
best 7-under-par round by ju-nior Karolina Vlckova helped the Gators claim first place.
The Gators once again had 
momentum on their side, this time heading into the NCAA Na-tional Championship.
But it was not enough.
During team play, UF had just 
one under-par round in the com-
petition — sophomore Taylor Tomlinson’s first round of the 
tournament.
Florida went home unceremo-
niously while junior Kelly Gras-sel continued after qualifying as an individual. She finished in a 
tie for 20th.
What came to define the 
Gators’ season was not a single tournament but rather the four-
tournament string of victories 
that Florida was able to tie to-gether.
Starting with the Allstate 
Sugar Bowl Intercollegiate Golf Championship and ending with the first-annual Clemson Invi-tational, the Gators picked up four-consecutive titles, which 
was more than they managed to 
total the previous year or the one before.

In 2018, another team can 
attempt a three-peat. 
After No. 1-seed Florida’s 
surprise last-second loss to No. 
16-seed Georgia in the Super Regionals of the NCAA Tour-nament, the 2016 Gators failed to become the second team in softball to win three-straight Women’s College World Series. 
No one expects a two-time 
defending champion to get 
worse. 
But this team, in many 
ways, is better than the 2014 
and 2015 versions.
The main reason is Florida’s 
pitching staff, the best in col-lege softball in 2016. 
Sophomore Aleshia Ocasio 
and junior Delanie Gourley were first and second in the na-tion in ERA through regional play. Gourley recorded two no-hitters on the season and fin-ished 19-4.
Ocasio’s 22-2 record earned 
her a spot as a finalist for USA Softball Collegiate Player of the Year, after Lauren Haeger be-came the first Gator to receive the award last year, an award considered the most prestigious honor in Division I softball.  
But while a number of things 
went right for the Gators, the team wasn’t perfect. 
The dominance of the 
pitching staff put less pres-sure on the offense. Perhaps there wasn’t enough pressure, though, because by the post-season, the Gators couldn’t win unless they held their opponent nearly scoreless. 
In the SEC Tournament, 
the Gators were eliminated af-ter scoring a total of two runs through two games. 
In the Super Regional se-
ries against Georgia, the Gators again scored two total runs be-Florida

For the first time since 2001, 
Florida has won a national title in 
doubles.
On Monday, the No. 3 ranked 
team of Brooke Austin and Kourt-
ney Keegan took on California’s No. 
4 Maegan Manasse and Denise Starr in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in the NCAA Individual Tournament finals. 
It was the second time the two 
duos met this season with Aus-tin and Keegan winning the first matchup. 
Nothing changed this time 
around. 
From the first game to the last, 
the Gator duo never let up, and their efforts earned them a national title.
“Obviously, I am incredibly 
proud of the performance today,” coach Roland Thornqvist said in a release. “They played like pros. 
They were very focused. They 
made virtually every return (they were) cool under pressure.”
Austin and Keegan dominated 
the first set, taking a 6-2 victory to put the Gator duo within one set of an NCAA title.
And in the second set, Austin and Keegan blanked their oppo-
nents, taking it 6-0 to win the na-
tional championship.
The Florida pairing was impres-
sive throughout the tournament. It only dropped one set, which came in the semifinals against UCLA’s Catherine Harrison and Kyle McPhillips. Florida went on to win that match 4-6, 6-3, 1-0. 
In their first match, they took 
down Syracuse’s Gabriela Knutson and Valeria Salazar Garza 6-4, 6-3. Then they defeated Pepperdine’s Matea Cutura and Christine Mad-dox 6-3, 7-6 and Arizona State’s Al-exandra Osborne and Ebony Pano-ho 6-4, 6-1.
“It really started coming together 
when they were down 4-1 in the first set against Arizona State,” Thorn-qvist said. “After that point, they locked in, they made first serves, they were poaching and they were really good in return games.
“I am really proud of them. Any-
time you win a National Champion-ship, you have to play well and play 
with courage and I am proud to say 
that is exactly what Kourtney and Brooke did today.”
The duo went 27-4 in doubles 
play on its way to the SEC regular season title, SEC Tournament title and, ultimately, the NCAA doubles championship.
And they aren’t done as a duo.Both Keegan and Austin will be returning for the 2016-2017 season to defend their newly won cham-pionship, with Keegan in her final year and Austin as a junior. @DreilingerJake

It was UF’s first since 2001TUESDAY, MAY 31, 2016   ALLIGATOR   15
fore losing 3-0 and 3-2. 
The team batting average 
dipped by six points between May 
10 and May 27 — the duration of the post season. 
The heart of Florida’s lineup, 
sophomore Kayli Kvistad — who leads the team in home runs (11) and RBIs (60) — recorded just one hit in UF’s last eight games. 
But there’s plenty of good to 
come in Florida’s future. 
It returns freshman pitcher 
Kelly Barnhill, who also threw a no-hitter and finished the regular season 11th nationwide in ERA. 
And offensively we’ll see more 
of freshman hitter Amanda Lo-renz, who finished the season with the best batting average of any first-year player in UF history. 
In fact, both Gators are two of 
the three finalists for the National Fastpitch Coaches Association’s Freshman of the Year, along with Oklahoma infielder Shay Knight-en. 
Florida also bids goodbye to 
its senior class, which finished the season with the second-win-ningest record of any four-year class in program history. 
But coach Walton said after the 
last game that the class should not only be remembered for what it left behind, but for what it brought to the school.
Because who knows if Florida’s 
recruits for the next three years would’ve come to UF without its senior class. 
"I think it's really too early to reflect on not only the players that graduated,” Walton said, "but the people that graduated. As I think about how far each one of them has come and their success in be-ing a Florida Gator, I'm just really proud of those girls. I'm going to miss them greatly."

already talking about what they were going to do to im-prove," Glaser said after their win at Briar's Creek Invita-
tional.
"They certainly haven’t rested or been content with 
the wins. I haven’t seen any egos popping out, I haven’t 
seen anybody really being content with the way that they 
played."
Florida has signed three incoming golfers for next sea-
son.
Elin Esborn (from Sweden), Marta Perez (from Spain) 
and Carlotta Ricolfi (from Italy) will join the Gators' roster next season. 
The incoming members are ranked 146th, 80th and 
133rd in the World Amateur Golf Rankings, respectively, 
and are all members of their respective national teams.
The Gators will be losing Ursa Orehek, who claimed 
two top-25 finishes this season, as well as Laura Kanouse.
Returning will be Florida’s regular lineup of Vlckova, 
Grassel, Wagner, Tomlinson and junior Maria Torres, who was named an Honorable Mention All-American on 
Wednesday. 
For her fifth year as head coach, Glaser will have the 
arsenal to match this year’s success.

The Associated Press
OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Florida 
will have to break the curse of the 
No. 1 seed to win its first national championship in baseball.
The Gators were awarded the 
top seed in the NCAA baseball tour-nament Monday, leading a record four Southeastern Conference teams among the eight national seeds. Flor-ida (47-13) was ranked No. 1 in the polls for most of the season and fin-ished runner-up to Texas A&M in the SEC Tournament.
No top seed has won the cham-
pionship since Miami in 1999, the first year of the current tournament structure.
The other SEC national seeds are 
No. 4 Texas A&M (41-16), No. 6 Mis-sissippi State (41-16-1) and No. 8 LSU (42-18).
The Atlantic Coast Conference 
has three national seeds in No. 2

11) and No. 7 Clemson (42-18). The Big 12 has the other national seed in Texas Tech (41-16).
The SEC also set a record Sunday 
when the NCAA selection committee picked seven teams to host regionals. Six ACC teams will host regionals, including defending national cham-
pion Virginia (37-20).
The 16 regionals are Friday to next Monday and include four teams playing a double-elimination format. 
Regional winners advance the next week to best-of-three super region-als, which will determine the eight teams moving on to the College World Series in Omaha beginning June 18.
The 64-team field is made up of 
31 automatic qualifiers and 33 at-
large selections.
Ten ACC teams are in the tourna-
ment, tying the record for most from 
one conference.
“I’ve never seen a league as strong 
as this year,” 37th-year Florida State coach Mike Martin said. “Ten teams is quite an accomplishment.”
North Carolina nearly gave the 
ACC an 11th entry. At No. 19, the Tar Heels (34-21) have the highest 
Ratings Percentage Index ranking of 
any team ever snubbed. The RPI is one of several metrics the selection committee uses to determine at-large 
teams.
Selection committee chairman 
Joel Erdmann said the Tar Heels 
were the first team left out after fol-lowing an 18-2 start with a 16-19 fin-ish and fifth-place finish at 13-17 in the ACC’s Coastal Division.
“What makes it unique is they are 
within the top conference in the na-
tion, but when you really break down 
their field of work, their resume, they within the conference struggled a bit,” Erdmann said. “You’re looking to find reasons to pull them in (but) they didn’t perform well against the best teams in the league.”
Four teams are in for the first time 
as automatic qualifiers: Fairfield (32-24) of the Metro Atlantic Conference, Alabama State (38-15) of the South-western, Utah Valley (37-21) of the Western Athletic and St. Mary’s (33-23) of the West Coast.
Western Michigan (22-32) up-set Kent State in the Mid-American 
Conference title game and is one of 
two teams that made it as automatic qualifiers with losing records.
The other is Utah (25-27), which 
won the Pac-12 regular-season title — the league doesn’t have a con-ference tournament — with a 19-11 league mark. The Utes are in their fifth season in the Pac-12 and fin-
ished last each of the previous four, never winning more than seven con-ference games.
Erdmann said the last three teams 
picked for at-large bids were South-
eastern Louisiana (39-19, No. 40 RPI), Nebraska (37-20, No. 47) and South Alabama (40-20, No. 49). The next two teams left out after North Carolina were Oregon State (35-19, No. 44) and West Virginia (36-22, 
No. 62)
