Despite being bought by the 
UF Foundation last summer, the 
43-year-old pizza joint Leonardo’s By The Slice will remain open for at least another year.
Both Leonardo’s and the adja-
cent Bistro 1245, at 1245 W. Univer-sity Ave., were anticipated to close after this summer — but because UF hasn’t yet made plans for the prop-erty, owner Steve Solomon said both restaurants will stay open. For the foreseeable future, Thursdays will remain Spinach Artichoke Day, and 
Fridays BBQ Chicken.
“We don’t have an expiration 
date. We’re going to try and stay 
open as long as possible,” Solomon, 69, said. “There’s no other place like this in the world.”
UF spokesperson Steve Orlando 
said the university and the founda-tion are continuing to weigh their 
options for the property, and that in 
the original deal, Leonardo’s agreed to stay open until at least summer of 2017.
When Leonardo’s eventually 
closes, Solomon said his customers can go down West University Ave-nue to Leonardo’s 706, his more up-scale restaurant, one that isn’t facing the looming threat of closure.
On Thursday, Solomon hand-fed 
a Big Leo pizza slice to his longtime employee Brian Johnson; it was his way of saying Leonardo’s had a fu-ture, and that Johnson would even-
tually take over the restaurant.
However, the university has not 
given Solomon a deﬁ  nitive move-out day. He said he’s predicting 
Leo’s will stay there for the next ﬁ  ve years.
Solomon said the best way 
for community members to pre-serve historic and unique spots in Gainesville is to ignore the chain restaurants on Archer Road. Instead, Solomon said business should be 
given to local staples like Satchel’s 
Pizza, Emiliano’s Cafe and The Top.
“Leonardo’s is an endangered species,” he said. “It’s a small, in-dependently owned restaurant in a time of corporate dominance. We’re 
just the small guy, and we need ev-
erybody to come to Leonardo’s to experience our place, because we’re the personality of Gainesville.”
Matt LeBlanc said he’d likely be 
lost without Leonardo’s during his ﬁ  nal year of college. Thankfully, the UF information systems junior will be able to frequent his favorite pizza 
shop until his graduation next May.
“I come here at least once a 
week, and I’m ecstatic that it’ll be 
staying open,” the 21-year-old said.
Gainesville native Sydney Krul-
jac was a customer at Leonardo’s before she could walk. Today, the 22-year-old proudly stands behind the counter as an employee, and will 
continue to do so for the next year.
“I’ve never loved a job more,” 
Kruljac said. “I feel really lucky to 
have been given this job.”
Kruljac said Leonardo’s conve-
nient location and incredible staff has made the restaurant a staple in both the Gainesville and UF com-munity.
“That’s how it’s been since the 
’70s,” she said. “Even for those who haven’t been here, I think they look at Leonardo’s as a landmark for Gainesville.”

The UF chapter of Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity 
was placed on administrative suspension by its 
national fraternity Wednesday after UF began investigating accusations of hazing, drug use and the distribution of drugs.
The chapter received a directive from UF in 
February limiting its activities on and off cam-pus. Dean of Students Jen Day Shaw sent the letter to the chapter after her ofﬁ  ce received evi-dence of brothers messaging each other about hazing.
“I am highly concerned by the nature of 
these accusations and their potential impact on student safety,” Day Shaw wrote in the letter.
Day Shaw said the Division of Student Affairs 
was investigating allegations that the fraternity forced members to perform acts of servitude and demeaning behavior. She said some mem-bers forced others to stay up until early morning, interfering with the students’ academic success.
The violations the chapter is accused of also 
include two charges of members using drugs and distributing them. Moreover, Day Shaw said the fraternity accepted members who weren’t UF students, which is not allowed according to university policy.
UF’s Pi Kappa Alpha president could not be 
reached for comment. The fraternity’s national spokesperson, Brent Phillips, said the chapter is working with UF to address the issues. 
After Day Shaw sent the letter to the chapter, 
Mick Earley, the assistant director of the Ofﬁ  ce of Student Conduct and Conﬂ  ict Resolution, sent another letter warning the fraternity that there were allegations that the chapter had failed to 
comply with the directive Day Shaw ordered.
“(Gators) obey the law, and we are support-
ive and helpful to each other,” Day Shaw said. 
“The alleged violations include a number of be-haviors that violate that.”UF’s Pi Kappa Alpha accused

A crowd of people packed the chamber 
and ﬁ  lled the hallway with chatter, laugh-
ter and the occasional scowl. It was Valen-
tine’s Day, but rather than celebrating a day of love with their families, residents of Mi-
canopy were ready to bombard their town 
commissioners with anger.
This special meeting of the town of Mi-
canopy, a 600-person village about 20 min-utes south of Gainesville, was called to ad-dress the heart of the town, which residents 
accused the town’s commissioners of rip-
ping out.
In a community that has no bars, no doc-tor’s ofﬁ  ces and more than 10 churches, the 
center of everything is the downtown area. 
This is where locals congregate at the Cof-fee n’ Cream to have non-alcoholic drinks, 
talk and listen to live music on the porch. 
It’s where residents drive down Cholokka Boulevard in everything from John Deere 
tractors to plastic, battery-powered trucks 
during the city’s annual July Fourth Parade. It’s where elderly tourists come to enjoy a 
mixture of antique shops, art galleries and 
empty streets they can cross without look-ing.
And it used to be where two towering ce-
dar trees provided shade.

Aztec calendar stone replica was 
24 tons and that it was made of stone. The original weighed 24 tons, and the replica is made of fiberglass.

· 911 REPORT · 911 REPORT · 911 REPORT · 911 REPORT ·Dunnellon Middle School faced heightened securi-
ty Wednesday after a 12-year-old threatened a school 
shooting, ofﬁ  cials said.
School administrators told Marion County Sheriff’s 
Ofﬁ  ce school resource deputies Tuesday at about 4:30 p.m. that a threat was made, which would affect school Wednesday, according to an MCSO press release. Depu-
ties investigated and found a threat written on the inside 
of a textbook by the student, whose name was not re-leased.
“I planned a school shooting,” she wrote. “It’s going 
to happen on 3-29-17.”
When deputies interviewed her and her mother on 
Wednesday, she admitted to writing the note in an effort to “be cool,” according to the press release. Deputies determined she was not a threat to the school.
The girl was arrested on a charge of disruption of 
school function. The student will also be placed in an alternative school and won’t be allowed to return to the middle school’s campus, said Kevin Christian, a Marion County Public Schools spokesperson. 
Christian said parents were notiﬁ  ed of the incident 
Wednesday night when the school’s principal sent an automated voicemail to students’ homes.
“In this day in age, we have to take everything seri-
ously,” he said. “If you do this, you will get in trouble. We don’t tolerate this kind of behavior.”MCSO: 12-year-
old threatened school shooting to ‘be cool’
HE WAS ON PAID SUSPENSION 
SINCE FEBRUARY.
A Marion County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce deputy resigned 
Thursday for giving false testimony during a deposition, 
MCSO said.
Former K9 Deputy Joshua Parker submitted his resig-
nation before MCSO administrators ﬁ  red him, according to a press release issued by the sheriff’s ofﬁ  ce.
On Feb. 13, State Attorney Brad King sent a letter to 
Sheriff Billy Woods stating that Parker’s testimony was unreliable, according to the press release. The Ofﬁ  ce of the State Attorney found Parker was unreliable on two cases, including a case against another former MCSO deputy Jesse Terrell. 
During a deposition, Parker gave false testimony dur-
ing a state felony battery trial of Terrell, according to the press release. King said Parker’s testimony could only be used if it was corroborated by other reliable evidence.
After Woods received the letter, Parker was sus-
pended with pay while an internal investigation was conducted, MCSO spokesperson Lauren Lettelier said. Woods decided to terminate Parker because of his liabil-ity, according to the press release.
“Sheriff Woods ultimately made the decision to termi-
nate Parker from the agency, citing the insurmountable issues the State Attorney’s Ofﬁ  ce vocalized along with the liability and public concern that would be associ-ated with keeping Parker as a deputy sheriff,” the press release said.
Lettelier said Parker was a deputy since 2003 and was 
also on the SWAT team.MCSO deputy

HE WAS ON HIS WAY HOME FROM 
A STRIP CLUB. 
After indulging in wine coolers and visiting a strip club, 
a Gainesville man was found asleep in his car at a green 
light Wednesday, police said.
Kimar Wallace Brown, 27, was driving a Ford Crown 
Victoria on the wrong side of Southwest 16th Avenue, wit-nesses told police, according to an arrest report. One wit-ness said Brown almost crashed into her car.
Another witness told police Brown was stopped at a 
green light on the corner of South Main Street and South-west 16th Avenue, according to the report. Responding of-ﬁ  cers found Brown asleep behind the wheel, with the car in drive.
Brown had red, watery eyes and had trouble walking 
straight, police said. Brown said he was on the way home from Cafe Risque, at 17035 County Road 234, and that he drank some wine coolers about four hours earlier, accord-
ing to the report.
Brown performed poorly on ﬁ  eld sobriety exercises but 
refused to submit to a breathalyzer test, according to the 
report. Ofﬁ  cers found a water bottle with a mixed alcoholic drink in the car.
Police arrested Brown for driving under the inﬂ  uence 
and took him to the Alachua County Jail, where he was released Thursday afternoon on his own recognizance. 
Brown said he was tired and wasn’t under the inﬂ  uence 
of drugs or alcohol.
“I was really just sleep-deprived,” he said. “I’m very 
sorry for what happened, but I wasn’t under the inﬂ  uence of any drugs or anything.”GPD: Drunk man

Next time you take a bite of raw cookie 
dough, you won’t be ﬂ  irting with salmo-
nella.
Do-Lish, a new bakery specializing in 
raw cookie dough, is set to open its doors 
sometime next week at 1113 W. University 
Ave., said owner Jolie Nantz.
The bakery, set to replace One Greek 
Store, will feature nine ﬂ  avors of raw cook-ie dough including chocolate chip, lemon cookie, salted caramel, peanut butter and dark chocolate, Nantz said. The safe-to-eat dough is made with heat-treated ﬂ  our and doesn’t contain eggs.
Currently, the store will be open Monday 
through Saturday from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m., Nantz said. To stoke students’ appetites, coupons will be passed out on Turlington Plaza on Monday, granting two scoops of cookie dough for $5. Regular prices have 
not yet been released. The bakery will also 
sell baked goods including brownies, cup-cakes and cookies, she said. 
“We’re just going to have fun with it,” 
Nantz said. “I hope that when all of the stu-dents come in, they feel at home in our little bakery.”
Nantz, 47, said the New York City bak-
ery DO, Cookie Dough Confections inspired 
her to open Do-Lish in Gainesville.
“I’ve always wanted to have something 
downtown for the students,” she said.
Mathew Lynch, a 20-year-old UF nucle-
ar engineering sophomore, said he never 
heard of a cookie-dough bakery before.
“I’m deﬁ  nitely excited to bring all of my 
friends,” he said.Raw cookie dough bakery

As students enter the University Audito-
rium on Monday to hear Ben Shapiro speak, 
Nate Quinn will stand outside and protest.
Quinn, a UF psychology freshman, said the 
conservative political commentator’s hateful 
rhetoric inspired him to organize a demonstra-
tion against him. 
On Wednesday, Quinn created a Facebook 
event page advertising his planned demonstra-tion and posted ﬂ  iers on Turlington Plaza.
“He’s rude and disrespectful,” the 19-year-
old said. “He’s ﬂ  at-out offensive to a lot of mi-nority groups.”
Accent Speakers Bureau and the UF chap-
ter of Young Americans for Freedom will pay Shapiro $20,000 for his 6 p.m. appearance, ac-cording to Alligator archives.Protesters will chant and give out informa-
tion about Shapiro’s hateful comments at the auditorium entrance facing Turlington Plaza, 
Quinn said. 
So far, eight Facebook users — including 
Quinn — have marked ‘going’ on the protest’s 
Facebook page.
Quinn said Shapiro is anti-Black Lives Mat-
ter, anti-immigration, anti-Muslim and anti-transgender.
Gloria Li, a UF environmental science and 
philosophy sophomore, said although protest-
ers may think UF is sponsoring Shapiro’s opin-
ions, she doesn’t agree. 
Li, 19, said although her political beliefs 
lean left, she will attend the event to hear what Shapiro says. She said she hopes the protest is peaceful. 
“It would be an embarrassment to me as a 
student if violence happened,” she said.UF student plans protest of

The executive director of the Washing-
ton, D.C.-based Student Press Law Center 
is coming to work at UF.
UF’s College of Journalism and Com-
munications announced Wednesday that 
Frank LoMonte will start as the new ex-
ecutive director for The Brechner Center, UF’s center for the freedom of informa-tion, in early August. LoMonte, who’s worked as a journalist and lawyer, was one of about 25 people who applied for the position after former executive direc-tor Sandra Chance stepped down at the beginning of Fall, said Clay Calvert, the 
director of the Marion B. Brechner First 
Amendment Project at UF.
“It is a magnificent hire for the College 
of Journalism and Communications but also the University of Florida,” Calvert said. The Brechner Center is a nonprofit 
educational center that answers questions and offers legal advice about media law and the First Amendment.  
LoMonte’s annual salary will be 
$140,000, UF spokesperson Steve Orlando wrote in an email. 
LoMonte said he was an undergraduate 
in political science at UF and finished his degree at Georgia State University. After 
working as a journalist for 11 years, he 
attended the University of Georgia’s law school, graduating in 2000. 
Since 2008, LoMonte was the executive 
director for the Student Press Law Center, a nonprofit advocating for students’ First Amendment Rights. For the Brechner Cen-ter, LoMonte said he wants to incorporate more data journalism and bring national 
attention to the program. 
“I got no problem punching back at the 
people who call CNN fake news,” he said.

A UF professor could be in line to 
win another award for his teaching 
skills.
George Christou, a UF chemistry 
professor, was one of 14 faculty mem-
bers at Southeastern Conference  uni-
versities to win the Faculty Achieve-ment Award, he said. He learned he won the award Wednesday. One professor from each university in the conference won the award, and now he could win a 2017 SEC Faculty Achievement Award.
Christou was nominated after win-
ning the 2015-2016 UF Teacher/Schol-ar of the Year award, he said. His UF classes include inorganic chemistry and bioinorganic chemistry.
To receive the award, Christou cre-
ated a package summarizing his re-search, scholarship and contributions to the chemistry and science commu-nities.
“All my international activities, 
conference organizations and inter-national teaching is also an additional part of the pack-age,” Christou said. 
From the 14 
nominees, the SEC will choose one for the Professor of the Year Award, which 
will be announced 
in April. 
“It’s a great hon-
or to effectively be representing UF as a nominee in the SEC,” Christou said. “We are never too old to get a pat on the back when we’re doing a good job, and it’s nice to get that from my university.”
Kylie Mitchell, a UF fifth-year 
chemistry graduate student, said she wasn’t surprised when she heard Christou received the award.
The 27-year-old said he explains 
chemistry in different ways to make sure his students understand the ma-terial.
“Just by sitting in his class, it feels 
like you can easily understand any topic,” Mitchell said. “He has a huge passion for chemistry, he just truly loves it.”UF professor honored

WASHINGTON (AP) — Repub-
lican legislation letting states deny 
federal family planning money to Planned Parenthood and other abor-tion providers squeezed narrowly 
through the Senate on Thursday, res-
cued by an ailing GOP senator who returned to the Capitol after back surgery and a tie-breaking vote by Vice President Mike Pence.
In Congress’ latest clash mixing 
the politics of abortion, women’s health and states’ rights, Pence cast the decisive vote in a 51-50 roll call. The tally had been tied after two GOP senators, Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski and Maine’s Susan Collins, joined Democrats opposing the measure.
Senate approval sent the legisla-
tion to President Donald Trump, who was expected to sign it. The House voted its consent last month.
The bill erases a regulation im-
posed by former President Barack Obama shortly before he left office that lets states deny family planning funds to organizations only if they are incapable of providing those ser-vices. Some states have passed laws in recent years denying the money to groups that provide abortions.
There is already a ban on using 
federal funds for abortion except in rare instances.
Democrats assailed the legislation 
as an attack on women, two months after Trump’s inauguration prompt-
ed a women’s march on Washington 
that mushroomed into anti-Trump demonstrations around the nation.
“While Trumpcare was dealt a 
significant blow last week, it is clear that the terrible ideas that underpin it live on with Republicans in Con-gress,” said Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) using a nickname for the failed House health care bill. Mur-ray, among a stream of Democratic women senators who spoke, called the Senate measure “shameful” and “dangerous.”
Republicans said the measure 
would let states divert money now going to groups that provide abor-tion to organizations that don’t, like community health centers.
“It substituted Washington’s 
judgment for the needs of real peo-ple,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said of Obama’s rule.
With Republicans controlling 
the Senate 52-48, the Collins and Murkowski defections could have derailed the bill because Sen. John-ny Isakson, (R-Ga.) has been absent since he had spinal surgery Feb. 20.
He had a second operation March 
15 and has been recuperating in Georgia under doctor’s orders. But he got permission to return to Wash-ington for one day, his office said, and he did so using a walker.

Court records show that a for-
mer UF student whose hostility to-ward a Muslim professor got him suspended from Rollins College was accused of stalking a student 
and entering her room while at UF. 
Marshall Polston, a former UF 
student, felt his professor at Rollins 
College was discriminating against him because of his Christian faith, the Orlando Sentinel reported. He sent his professor, Areej Zufari, an email accusing her of silencing him after Zufari gave him a failing 
grade. Zufari filed a “protection 
against stalking” request against Polston on Friday after weeks of the two clashing, the Sentinel re-ported.
The story spread on social me-
dia, with people encouraging oth-ers to share and repost a message pushing for Zufari to be fired and 
Polston to be reinstated.
Polston couldn’t be immediate-
ly reached for comment.Polston was accused of stalk-
ing and burglary in January 2015 
after allegedly entering the room of another UF student living in Beaty Towers and refusing to leave, ac-cording to a sworn complaint af-fidavit filed with University Police.
The charges were eventually 
dropped due to a lack of evidence.
The victim, a now 21-year-old 
who transferred from UF in 2016, asked to remain anonymous due 
to the traumatic nature of the in-
cident.
Before Polston entered her 
room, the woman asked Polston for space and ignored his attempts to contact her, including him leav-ing a plate of food at her door, she said.
When Polston entered, the 
woman locked herself in her bed-room and hid under the desk while Polston jiggled the door handle. Eventually, she ran out of the room screaming for help and hid in the stairway, she said.
The victim said she’s upset 
seeing the current news about Polston because she wanted him to understand his actions. She said she wanted to take her charges to court, but when they were dropped she wasn’t emotionally prepared to fight it.
“He’s not the hero people want 
to think he is,” she said.
Jesse Phillips, a friend of 
Polston’s, said Polston’s history has nothing to do with the situa-tion.
Zufari and Polston could’ve ap-
proached the situation differently.
“I think we’ve all done things 
we regret, and we’ve all probably sent emails we regret sending,” 
Phillips said.  
Phillips said he wasn’t sur-
prised Polston spoke out about his 
strongly held beliefs, but thinks his suspension was unfair. 
“I think it’s something a 
university should be prepared for and be able to handle without suspending a student for send-
ing a confrontational email to a 
professor,” Phillips said. Suspended Rollins student was 
accused of stalking while at UF

The average American city is boring, but that is OK
In a short piece for The New Yorker, Cirocco 
Dunlap describes the wandering between New York City and Los Angeles that was much of her young adulthood. From with-in the limits of each city, the other seems 
much more appealing, yet when she gets there, the culture and habits of the locals only make her long for the place she just left. Back and forth, she wavers between both ends of Ameri-can culture, eventually ending by stating “half-way between New York and L.A., I imploded. I am so much happier now.”
The charming cities of Europe ooze with history and 
drip with culture. From the broad avenues of Paris, to the crooked canals of Venice, European cities might have their faults, but they do have one thing every city desires: true culture. All I need to see is a building strewn with vines and capped with a rounded mansard roof to know I am in Paris. Culture is abstract and sometimes hard to describe well with words, but it can certainly be felt from within. It may originate in people, but time is ultimately a dominant ingredient in the creation of culture. 
Kansas City is not Berlin, Wichita is not Glasgow and 
Phoenix is not even close to Madrid. Comparing these cit-ies is ridiculous, as their births and histories are too vastly different to weigh evenly, but I do not believe I am alone in feeling that most American cities lack the cultural pres-ence of cities abroad. 
The reason for this can only be time. The U.S. is still 
an infant compared to the established identities across the seas and has simply not been around enough to beneﬁ  t from centuries of creativity, change and interaction among people. After spending some time living in France, I re-turned home to Orlando, a plastic city built by a cartoon rodent, and was underwhelmed. Ninety percent of the buildings I saw were built after 1970, and I believed if a city’s personality couldn’t be described in one sentence, then it was fatally bland.
But I was being too harsh on America. The 
cookie-cutter cities of the U.S. essentially fol-low these guidelines. A few “historical” struc-tures stand in a central business district, sur-rounded by an inﬁ  nitely expanding radius of subdivisions and strip malls, peppered with airports and schools and all connected with spaghetti strands of highways. The interstates of America branch out and hug the continent like veins and arteries, ﬂ  owing with the blood 
of the country itself. The towns of America may not be historically old, but that does not mean they are deprived of anything. In fact, I think the lack of obvious “culture” in most American cities says a lot.
America’s “culture” is not simple, nor is it describable 
in a few words. Our history is complex, and the nature of America’s growth has made the presence of one, deﬁ  nable culture an enigma. Many American’s ancestors crossed a treacherous sea to settle here at some point. Very few of our families have been in this land for more than 200 years. In fact, America has long prided itself on being a  melting pot; not one deﬁ  nable culture, but instead a beau-tiful and messy conglomerate of others. 
With such a vast array of cultures present for most of 
the country’s development, it is no surprise that many of America’s cities lack one, clear cultural identity. Topeka, Kansas, may be a bore to visit, but that is not what Ameri-ca is for. Our cities are not tourist destinations, but homes. America has never needed to rely on a common culture, but has instead thrived on the intense unity among people willing to leave familiar home countries for the U.S. Don’t look down on the identical towns of the U.S., but appreci-ate them, for they represent a formula for a country that works.

Darts & Laurels 
On Thursday, North Carolina repealed the controversial 
House Bill 2, also known as HB2 and the “bathroom bill.” HB2 
sparked national attention, as it restricted protection for members of the LGBTQ+ community and, most contentiously, required that transgender people use the bathroom corresponding to the 
sex listed on their birth certiﬁ  cate. The new governor, Democrat 
Roy Cooper, repealed HB2 yesterday morning. He says it is not his preferred solution, but that it was an important ﬁ  rst step. We’re giving a laurel to this repeal — it might not be perfect, but it’s an important measure for LGBTQ+ protection and rights, especially in a state that was determined to deny people the right to relieve their bladders in peace.
Netﬂ  ix premiered its trailer for “Death Note,” based on the 
manga of the same name. There was something noticeable in this 
trailer for a series that is supposed to be Japanese. Namely the 
fact that the main character — Light Yagami in the original, now Light Turner — is played by a white actor. This is only the most recent example of Hollywood whitewashing. Earlier this month came another manga-inspired ﬁ  lm, “Ghost in the Shell,” starring obviously not-Asian Scarlett Johansson, as well as Netﬂ  ix’s latest Marvel series, “Iron Fist.” Although the original “Iron Fist” was not Asian, fans have pointed out that this was a prime oppor-tunity for a narrative about an Asian American getting in touch 
with his roots, especially when British-Singaporean actor Lewis 
Tan was heavily considered for the role. Once again, American media continues to rob Asians and Asian Americans of their own stories; sure, the Japanese version of “Death Note” used an all-Japanese cast, but who’s to say the default “American” is white? We’re throwing a heavy dart at Hollywood, Netﬂ  ix and American media for this continued whitewashing, despite constant backlash. 
As Floridians we’re all familiar with the Florida panther — we 
mean the subspecies of cougar here, not the hockey team — and we’re all pretty aware that these big cats are highly endangered. In fact, they have struggled to breed in the northern part of the state for a few decades, now. But earlier this week, two Florida panther kittens were spotted north of the Caloosahatchee River. This is great news for the subspecies, which has been trying to recover in numbers for decades now. Hopefully this means that panthers will start moving north and reclaim the territory they once had. So a laurel to these lil’ panther kittens — the surviv-
al of your species depends on you guys, and also, you’re pretty 
darn cute. 
Moving on to a more depressing topic, since his measure to 
overturn the Affordable Care Act did not work, President Donald Trump turned his attention to other Obama-era policies, namely the former president’s Clean Power Plan, which was intended to reduce our country’s greenhouse gas emissions and get us on track to clean energy. This is the future of our planet at stake here. Even if, hypothetically, human-caused climate change is 
one big myth, what do we have to lose if we work for cleaner en-
ergy and eco-friendly solutions? What we’d get is a healthy plan-et, ready for the next generations, one that won’t be destroyed by mankind’s own greed. Trump wants to focus on bringing back coal jobs to America and making us energy independent, but the fact is, the future of our environment is a problem that every na-tion is going to face. And we all need to do our part to give the next generation a tomorrow. A dart to Trump for cutting back these vital environmental regulations — what good are more 
jobs going to be if there is no planet left for our grandchildren?

Feminine sexuality is viewed 
in many ways, all ﬁ  tting un-der a patriarchal umbrella. One way to view femme sexuality is that women are 
docile and submissive, allowing the supposedly more powerful man to be in charge sexually. In contemporary times, this idea is reﬂ  ected by the fact that the multi-billion-dollar industry of pornogra-phy caters almost exclusively to men, with a subset being marketed “for women.” Women are supposed to desire love and family, merely 
putting up with sex to please their man.
This idea contradicts the other mainstream 
depiction of female sexuality, which portrays 
women as sinful, evil sex goddesses, eas-ily leading poor men astray. After all, it was Eve who ate the forbidden apple, condemn-ing the rest of mankind. There is the idea of the femme fatale, popularized in early 20th-century ﬁ  lm noir but ancient in origin, which 
recognizes the fact that women are sexual 
creatures but still strips men of any responsi-bility, because men are just more sexual than women are, and they can’t help it.
The notion of the femme fatale is still very 
relevant, and nothing illustrates this better than the comment from Toronto Police Con-stable Michael Sanguinetti that prompted organizers Heather Jarvis and Sonya Barnett 
to begin the SlutWalk marches in Toronto, 
which have since grown into a worldwide movement.
 “Women should avoid dressing like sluts 
in order not to be victimized," Sanguinetti re-portedly said to a group of students in Ontario, Canada, during a talk on health and safety in 2011.
He later apologized, but the comment was 
obscene, and it reﬂ  ects an opinion shared by many. Dress codes at schools frequently dic-tate that women and girls should not wear clothes that might distract male students and teachers. This attitude is not OK. The only per-son responsible for sexual assault or being “distracted” by a low-cut shirt is the perpetrator of the assault or the gazing eye at school. 
However, do movements like 
the SlutWalk help? Does a woman-centric effort to take back our sexu-ality coupled with the reclamation of the word “slut” assist the femi-nist movement or take away from it?
Leora Tanenbaum, the author of “I Am Not 
a Slut: Slut-Shaming in the Age of the Inter-net,” disapproves of the word's reclamation.
"Every single day we have a new report of 
an act of sexual assault on a college campus, and that gives me pause," she said in a 2015 interview with The Daily Beast. "The fact is that most people don’t use words like ‘slut’ and ‘ho’ the way we in the feminist in-group use it."
I agree. We must look at the society we 
are living in and ask ourselves, “How will 
my words make other people feel?” Women 
should absolutely be able to embrace their sexuality, and it is never the victim’s fault if they are raped. Sanguinetti’s words were wrong. But the reaction to it was wrong, too. In a society where femme people are con-stantly under scrutiny by “the male gaze,” it is difﬁ  cult to know whether the choices we make as women to reclaim our sexuality are 
contributing to the already-present dehuman-
ization and objectiﬁ  cation that we go through daily. If people of all genders still call women “sluts” in a derogatory way, which they do, how can we reclaim it for ourselves? Feminists should be working toward a future where sex is not stigmatized and women are not seen as objects. However, in the current system, this is still the case. Until we reach this sexual uto-
pia, where, at the very least, men take respon-
sibility for their actions, we’re going to have to ﬁ  nd a different word.

originally ran in The Daily Emerald.
Sexuality and stigma: feminists' taskUWire
T aylor Griggs
UWireAbout two months ago, a man wearing an arm-band depicting a swastika stood ﬁ  rmly on Turlington Plaza. Jewish professors 
came to his aid to ensure he was not harmed. Passionate students came forward in art and song to discredit his hate. Well-meaning as his opponents were, he still got the attention he wanted, and a debate sparked on campus about the na-ture of free speech and how far the public is willing to limit that sacred right for 
the safety of all.
The outrage has already begun in anticipa-
tion of Ben Shapiro’s upcoming talk at UF. Fa-
mous for having made questionable comments about Islam but being relatively anti-Trump, Shapiro’s views reﬂ  ect a version of American conservatism the public is not used to seeing recently. There have been movements on oth-er campuses to prevent his speeches. His Jew-
ish background has led him to receive anti-
Semitic hate mail. One would think he would know what it was like to feel outcast and even threatened in a hostile America.
To the dedicated students once again look-
ing to ﬁ  ght outdated intolerance by protesting Shapiro’s visit, this progressive activist has a thought: Bigger, stronger causes need us right now.
Picking battles is difﬁ  cult. I usually roll my 
eyes when people tell me to pick my battles. “Don’t tell me what to do,” is my ﬁ  rst thought, followed by a realization of how condescend-ing it is to impose upon another your notion of what is worth ﬁ  ghting for. Today’s youth feels more empowered than ever to ﬁ  ght for their beliefs, and I applaud and encourage them to keep ﬁ  ghting. But activism and advocacy is 
not a battle. It is a long-term ﬁ  ght that requires 
full attention and participation. Civic engage-ment and social awareness is not something to dip your feet into when convenient. It de-mands energy and stamina for the long haul.Protesting the swastika armband 
took time, energy and commitment that could have been better spent on tougher but more worthwhile ﬁ  ghts. To spend a day around Nazi 
imagery is exhausting, but doing 
so accomplished little in the battle against fascism. The man had noth-ing to contribute to the conversa-tion and his message would have been diminished the most by a collective effort to ignore him. Ben Shapiro has made some problem-
atic remarks. He has retracted some, too. He 
has some conservative views that will not be 
swayed, yet he has switched other opinions fully in a decade’s time. He is a human with a voice to give toward political discussion, and we owe non-violent voices a fair chance to share their opinions.
The university atmosphere is one of accep-
tance and growth. We learn best as a com-munity. Our eyes open through diversity and 
willingness to accept new ideas. Perhaps Sha-
piro’s address will give passionate students new ﬁ  ghts to focus on or thoughts to consider in future debates. Barring the case of someone loudly declaring violent calls to action against people in their hate speech, we need to be careful about how we protest individual peo-ple, and we should instead focus on causes and movements as a whole.
With caution, I look forward to what Ben 
Shapiro has to share. I hope to ﬁ  nd common ground with him, and I am prepared to work as an activist against causes he brings to my attention with which I disagree. There are big-ger battles that need everything I have to give right now, and I cannot expend too much en-ergy on this one person. In the interest of the health of my fellow students and the progress 
of the causes I care most about, I hope the 
Gator Nation will do the same.

Don't focus on protesting individualsGuest column
Megan 
Newsome
Speaking Outroot those two trees, believing they were rot-
ting and citing UF experts who deemed them 
unsafe. They replaced them with two benches, 
a concrete slab and dirt.
Residents weren’t pleased, and about one-
tenth of the town decided to let commissioners know.
Micanopy is a place where the cliche small-
town water tower is blocked by an oak canopy, so killing trees is viewed as a grave sin. Some residents even held a memorial service for the 
fallen cedars, whose ages were disputed by 
residents. Some say the trees were almost 150 years old, while others claim they were young-
er than half a century.
And even if they didn’t attend the “funer-
al,” the majority of the town’s residents at the meeting at least share the same opinion. Most 
— like local restaurant manager Layla Ruffino — were upset with the town’s decision. But 
some disagreed.
The Rev. Christopher Stokes defended the 
commission, arguing that it did its best with the information it had. And some others, like 
Stephanie Bartsch and Paul Cohen, were there to try to understand what happened. 
Many of them can’t remember the last time 
so many people from the town showed up to a commission meeting, but regardless of what 
brought them to Micanopy’s town hall, they 
were there because of a shared love for their tiny town and a desire to make it better. But 
before they could voice their concerns, Stokes 
led a pre-meeting prayer followed by the Pledge of Allegiance.  
“We ask that you continue to bless us,” the 
pastor said to conclude, “and our town.”
At the end of the pledge, Mayor Virginia 
Mance, a 60-year-old woman whose tufts of gray curls bounce when she speaks, turned to 
the hallway and invited anyone who wanted 
to speak to enter the chamber. Each person got one minute.
Standing on the podium made of weath-
ered yellow wood, sandwiched between a wall 
bearing a 2017 John Deere calendar and anoth-
er wall sporting plaques thanking the commis-sion for its support of Micanopy youth teams, 
Mance heard person after person lecture the 
commission for removing those trees.
“What’s there now doesn’t look like Mican-
opy to me,” one man said. 
“The culture of this town is nature-loving, 
tree-loving people,” said a mother with dark, 
brown hair. “Historic preservation people that 
want to leave that town the way it is. And you violated that.”
Added another: “We feel that it’s wrong. 
And if you don’t feel that, then you’ve gotta change something.”
And another: “I think we’re all here be-
cause we’re mourning those trees.”
Then it was Layla Ruffino’s turn.
It didn’t take the manager of Blue Highway 
Pizza long to get the crowd clapping. An earlier 
speaker noted that if people were so upset with 
the commissioners, they should run against 
them. The 36-year-old opened her one minute by pointing out that she was, in fact, running, 
earning an ovation. However, a month later 
she lost in the town’s election by 21 votes.
Similar to other residents, Ruffino is devas-
tated by what happened, and she wants the commissioners to know it. 
“Every time I drive home, I’m heartbro-
ken,” she told them. “I don’t think it matches Micanopy. I don’t think it honors the historic canopy town that we have. And I am really 
disappointed about that.”
Like Ruffino, Mance seemed to know ev-
eryone in town. She called most of them by name.
“Shawn?”“Christine?”
“Megan?”“Dan?”
“Daryl?”
“Carol?”One she didn’t call by name, though, was 
Stephanie Bartsch.
A German immigrant, Bartsch has lived in 
Micanopy for five years. She sells pretzels and 
greets her neighbors while gardening in her 
front yard. She said Micanopy reminds her of the small German town where she grew up. 
As a green card holder, she’s allowed to live 
in the U.S. permanently, but she can’t vote. Regardless, she still comes to these meetings 
whenever she can. 
On this night, though, she didn’t have 
much to say. She just wanted to be aware of what’s going on where she lives. 
“I’m just really impressed by the democracy 
at work,” she said. “And I think that’s the way to go forward.”
Immediately after Bartsch, it was Stokes’ 
turn. 
The 53-year-old pastor of New Beginning 
Christian Worship Center, which he founded 
with his wife to help the people of the town, is 
a lifelong Micanopy resident. 
“You hear the saying that it takes a village 
to raise a child,” he said. “And Micanopy was that village.”
“Everybody knew you, and if you did 
something, you were going to get corrected in the streets.”
But at the meeting, Stokes was the one do-
ing the correcting. 
Going against the tide of the room, he 
thanked the commissioners for doing the best 
they could. He also reprimanded his fellow 
residents. 
Throughout the meeting, there had been 
applause, chatter and snide comments direct-ed at the commissioners. Stokes wanted to be 
clear that this is not the character of the town where he, and his parents, were born. 
“All of the murmuring and going back and 
forth — that’s not Micanopy,” he said before 
getting up to leave for Tuesday night Bible 
study. 
“At the end of the night,” he added, 
“what’re you gonna do?”
Paul Cohen, a 58-year-old who has lived in 
Micanopy for five years, will spend the “end of 
the night” taking care of his parents. 
He moved to the town for that reason. His 
folks — Ronald, 87, and Diana, 89 — need constant care, which Cohen provides by hiring 
helpers as well as looking after them himself.
“Pretty much anything they don’t do,” he 
said, “I do it.”
But Cohen still finds time for these meet-
ings, and for the town, whenever he can. How-
ever, tonight there isn’t much left for him to 
say. He’s seated in the second-to-last row in a room of more than 60 people. Pretty much ev-
erything that could have been said had already 
been said by the time it was his turn. 
Don Duer, who couldn’t stand up to speak, 
already called out the town for lacking trans-parency. The 80-year-old was there to make that point with his wife on their 32nd wedding 
anniversary.
Bud DesForges, a regular attendee, also al-
ready called out other people at the meeting for not coming to more of them. 
“Participate,” he snapped. “Put in some of 
your time, your energy and your effort. Don’t just come when the water bill is over, or your 
water’s bad, or they cut down a tree. Come every time for the mundane things. The things 
that aren’t important.”
So Cohen, a member of the town’s tree 
committee, asked questions about the removal of the cedars. 
After an hour and a half, everyone had spo-
ken except the commissioners. Now, it was their turn to try and answer the town’s accusa-
tions. Joe Aufmuth, a former mayor and current 
librarian at UF’s Marston Science Library, vol-unteered to go first. 
“I’m sorry,” he said as the largest applause 
of the night erupted across the room. “I’m sor-ry that it happened.”
The other two commissioners shared simi-
lar sentiments with the audience, with one ask-ing the town for forgiveness. 
Then it was Mance’s turn. She tried to apologize without apologizing. 
Some people jeered.  
“None of us should be sitting up here for-
ever,” she said eventually, as some onlookers nodded their heads. 
“Believe me,” she added about heightened 
scrutiny of future tree removals, “in the future, that will occur under my watch.” 
Once again, murmuring ensued. “I hope not,” someone muttered. Then, Mance finally defended the commis-
sion’s decision to remove the trees.
“I still feel that that tree warranted coming 
down,” she said. 
After a 10-minute break, the commission re-
convened for its regular meeting, which takes place on the second Tuesday of each month. 
The crowd was about half of what it was at the 
special meeting. 
The first issue on the agenda was to recog-
nize Talmadge Bennett, the mayor of Horse-shoe Beach, a town on Florida’s gulf coast. He was there because Mance visited Horseshoe 
Beach to help residents clean up the devasta-
tion caused by hurricane Hermine in early Sep-tember. Bennett wanted to show his thanks by 
making Horseshoe Beach a “sister city” of Mi-
canopy. But before that — before he presented Mance with a plaque that she proudly placed 
on the commissioners’ microwave, next to 
their coffee maker — he referred back to the special meeting one last time.
“I do really appreciate,” he said, “the love 
that you folks have for this town.” 8   ALLIGATOR   FRIDAY, MARCH 31, 2017

Sports Writer
Even after Florida’s 4-1 win over 
Florida State on Tuesday — its ninth 
win in the past 10 games against the rival — Kevin O’Sullivan couldn’t help but reference UF’s most recent loss. 
Florida’s 10th-year head coach is 
looking for ways to improve. He knows 
he needs to win games before it’s too 
late in the season.“I’ve been looking at some things 
since Sunday’s game,” O’Sullivan said 
of the 10-6 loss to LSU Sunday. “Ob-viously that was a really disappointing way to lose.”
Just two innings away from a sweep 
of the Tigers, the Gators’ bullpen im-ploded to blow a four-run lead. Expe-rienced relievers Michael Byrne and Frank Rubio, along with freshmen An-drew Baker, Kirby McMullen and Ty-ler Dyson, combined to surrender eight runs — most of which came on a trio of home runs.
It was odd O’Sullivan mentioned the 
loss given that his team’s pitching staff had just held the Seminoles to one run. 
Perhaps he’s feeling the pressure 
as Florida, 2-4 in conference play, sits closer to the bottom of the SEC standings than the top. 
And when the Gators (17-9) square  UF needs its bats to wake up against Mizzou
When the ﬁ  nal buzzer rang in Madison Square Garden in the Elite Eight on Sun-day afternoon, three things became clear: The Gators were completely outplayed by South Carolina, their season was over and, 
last but not least, senior point guard Kasey Hill’s career as a Florida Gators basketball player was over as well. 
Now, in this column, I will not be writing about 
how Hill didn’t have the career he wanted, how he didn’t live up to the expectations of the fans or any-thing of that matter. Frankly, it’s too tiring and not worth discussing — especially considering he’ll never play at UF again.
Instead, what logically ﬂ  ows is who will take over 
at the point guard position once the 2017-18 season 
kicks off?
The most likely answer is junior guard Chris Chi-
ozza — the man who saved Florida’s tournament run with a running, buzzer-beating three-pointer in over-time against Wisconsin. 
Chiozza only averaged 7.2 points per game this 
season, but the strides he took after the Gators lost to Vanderbilt — the ﬁ  rst time — were unprecedented.
In the ﬁ  nal 17 games since that scoreless outing 
against the Commodores on Jan. 21, Chiozza upped 
his scoring average to 9.6 points per game and had 
nine double-ﬁ  gure scoring games. He also averaged 4.5 rebounds, 4.5 assists and 1.8 turnovers per game in that same frame. 
In many ways, Chiozza is actually very similar to

Florida senior Shayla Sanders 
couldn’t see the ﬁ  nish line. 
By the time she ﬁ  nished her leg of 
the relay at the 2015 NCAA Outdoor Championships, there was no time 
to see who ﬁ  nished ﬁ  rst. 
Four hundred meters run by four 
sprinters goes by quickly. 
Her relay team had struggled 
earlier that day. However, when teammate Robin 
Reynolds put her heels in the blocks 
at the starting line, Sanders knew her team was ready. 
“We said, ‘Forget everything, 
trust our marks, trust coach Hollo-way.' Because that’s what we’d been 
doing,” Sanders said. 
It wasn’t until she saw her team-
mate Kyra Jefferson shouting out in 
excitement that she knew. 
Her team had won the ﬁ  rst out-
door 4x100-meter relay national championship in school history.  And despite the team’s early strug-gles, Sanders said she wasn’t sur-prised. 
“We weren’t going to let nobody 
else beat us,” she said, “so that’s what we went and did.” 
That was 2015. Sanders was a 
redshirt sophomore. 
Now she’s a senior entering her 
ﬁ  nal season as a Gator. And this weekend at the Florida Relays, she wants more. Just like she always has.
•   •   •  
Sanders started running track in 
the sixth grade. Her father saw her potential as a sprinter after watching her as a cheerleader when she was 
young, so she tried track out. 
Sanders said she started out com-
peting in the 400 and 800 meters 
in sixth grade, and in seventh and eighth grade, she moved to the 100 and 200 meters, events known for those who can turn on the jets early in a race. But when she got to high school, Sanders said “it took a whole big change.” 
Sanders didn’t clarify what she 
meant by “whole big change,” but it could mean a few different things. 
It could mean her turning into 
a runner-up ﬁ  nisher in the 100 and 200 meters as a junior at the 2011 FHSAA Class 4A Outdoor Final. Or maybe it was her turning into a 100-meter and 200-meter champion  Sprinter Shayla Sanders hoping to go out ‘with a bang’

TRACK AND FIELD14   ALLIGATOR   FRIDAY, MARCH 31, 2017
off with Missouri (21-4, 4-2 SEC) this weekend in 
Columbia, Missouri, it’s no secret he’d like to see 
improvement from his offense. 
Florida’s anemic bats enter the series dead last 
in the SEC in hitting (.240) and second-to-last in runs scored (120).
Only one player, outfielder Nelson Maldonado, 
is hitting .300 or higher. 
Meanwhile, most of UF’s run producers and 
table-setters are struggling. JJ Schwarz, Jonathan India and Mike Rivera are all batting below .250, 
and 1-2 hitters Dalton Guthrie (.266) and Deacon Liput (.212) aren’t faring much better either. 
For that reason, O’Sullivan has tinkered with 
the lineup many times this season. 
“We’re trying to settle in on a lineup,” 
O’Sullivan said. 
“There’s still a couple guys we need to figure 
out and get them going.”
That’ll be no easy task going up against the Ti-
gers, a team with a 20-game win streak to their name already this season. 
Led by junior Friday night starter Tanner Houck 
(3-2, 2.80) and the SEC’s ERA leader TJ Sikkema 
(5-0, 0.56), Missouri figures to be a difficult match-
up for the Gators.
Two years ago, Houck carved up Florida in his 
home stadium to the tune of one run over eight in-nings. UF, however, touched him up for five runs 
in six frames a year ago. 
At a time when Florida’s pitching staff is carry-
ing the team, it could use a breather — a pressure-
less weekend in which the bats carry the load.

Sikkema has the 
SEC 's lowest ERA
Hill. 
They’re both creative passers. They’re 
both small, even for point guards (Hill is 
6-foot-1 and Chiozza is 6-foot). And they both play incredibly tenacious defense.
For example, during the Gators’ 22-point 
route of Kentucky in the O’Connell Center during the regular season, Hill and Chiozza 
were charged with shadowing the Wildcats’ 
electric scorer, Malik Monk. Monk had one of his worst games of the season, totaling 11 points on 14 shots and four fouls. 
“We both play hard. We’re tough,” Chi
-
ozza said about the similarities he sees be -tween himself and Hill.
“We’ve got that dog in us.”Welcomed differences between the 
duo’s games, however, are Chiozza’s abil
-
ity to stretch the floor and take care of the ball.
It’s no secret that in Hill’s four years 
with the team, he never truly learned to hit a shot from anywhere outside the paint. 
He’s a career 23.8-percent shooter from be
-
yond the arc, and this season, he averaged 
a career-high 3.1 turnovers per game. 
With Florida down two with 1:58 left in 
Sunday’s game against South Carolina, Hill bounced a pass to what he thought would 
be a cutting Devin Robinson. In reality, it went to the Gamecocks’ Sindarius Thorn
-
well. South Carolina eventually scored on 
the other end. You know the rest.
On the other hand, Chiozza connected 
on 30 threes this year (31.3 percent) and shot 78.8 percent from the charity stripe. 
Admittedly, Chiozza averaged significantly 
less minutes than Hill, but his 1.6 turnovers per game was a saving grace for the Gators’ offense. 
Point is, Florida fans have eagerly await
-
ed quality point guard play ever since Scot -
tie Wilbekin graduated at the end of UF’s last Final Four run in 2014. 
I think Chiozza could be the answer to 
those problems.COLUMN,  from pg. 13
at the 2012 FHSAA Class 4A Outdoor Finals and a bronze medalist in the same two events at the 2012 USATF Junior Outdoor Champi-onships. Or, possibly, it was her posting the top outdoor 100- and 200-meter times in the United States the same year. 
Regardless, recruiters took notice of her 
success, and the phones started ringing.   
“There were a lot of people calling,” she 
said, “but my coach made sure that, you know, I kept that dedication and that determination to do everything that I can do because I knew that a lot of people were looking at me.” 
Sanders took visits to Auburn, UCF, Ken-
tucky, Florida and an unofficial visit to Miami, ultimately deciding to go to school a little more 
than 300 miles north of her home in Pompano 
Beach. 
Since arriving at UF, Sanders has become 
a five-time USTFCCCA Outdoor All-American and a four-time Indoor All-American.
And as she goes into her last season repre-
senting the Gators, she said she still has things left to accomplish. 
“Every year that I come out to run, to com-
pete is always going out hard,” she said. “Go-ing out with a bang.”

Florida coach Mike Holloway said during 
Sanders’ time at Florida, she has kept the team in contention when it comes to sprints. He said she has become a mainstay as the second leg in the 4x100, and her accomplishments speak for themselves. But when he talks about Sand-ers, he talks more about her character than 
what her legs can do for the team. 
“Shayla is just a very positive human be-
ing,” Holloway said. “They don’t come any 
better as a person than Shayla. She’s always upbeat, she’s always positive, always with a smile on her face, and I’ve watched her grow into quite the young lady.
“I’m just very proud of the lady she’s be-
come on and off the track.”
As for this season, Sanders and the Gators 
are competing in their second full meet of the season at home in the Florida Relays, which started Thursday and run through Saturday.
Teams from across the country will come 
to compete at the meet, working on personal records and getting as close to perfection as possible early on in the outdoor season. 
As for Sanders, she will be focusing on the 
200 meters, an event she said her coaches need her to focus on a little more this season. 
And because she wasn’t able to compete 
during the 2017 indoor season with her team because of exhausted indoor eligibility, she said she’s been hard at work. 
As for what comes next in Sanders’ life after 
graduation in April, she has a few ideas. 
“What I plan to do is hopefully get a con-
tract and go pro,” she said with the smile her coach said never leaves her face. “Then, of course, go to 2020.”

WOMEN’S TENNIS
By Spencer Thompson
Sports Writer
On the way home from last weekend’s 
road matches, Roland Thornqvist had a lot on 
his mind. While the Gators women’s tennis team had just won two straight road games, the coach was thinking about another sport: basketball. 
While following Florida’s basketball team in 
the NCAA tournament, Thornqvist said he was able to draw parallels between Mike White’s 
team and his own. White spoke of his team 
as a group of guys who played for each other, 
bought into what the team was trying to do and were successful at it. Thornqvist’s teams over the years haven’t been much different.
“I thought of our team over the years, and 
our sport is different, but for us to have a re-ally good team in women’s tennis, you have to have players with egos,” he said. “But they were also players who believed in the mission 
not just when the mission beneﬁ  tted them, but 
what they could do to help the mission.”
Thornqvist is always focused on how the 
team can be the best by May, in time for its own 
NCAA championship run. He said the Gators’ “Florida-ﬁ  rst” mentality is something that has and is continuing to help them get there.
Florida will continue its mission today when 
it faces SEC opponent Alabama. The Tide will come into the Ring Tennis Complex after losing seven of their last eight games. They sit last in the conference with a 1-7 SEC record. 
Then, on Sunday, the Gators will face stiffer 
competition against Auburn. While the Tigers only sit ﬁ  ve spots higher than Alabama in the conference, their record boasts wins over Southern California, Georgia Tech, Tennessee and Mississippi State. Auburn also houses the No. 14 doubles team in Alizee Michaud and Taylor Russo.
While the Gators have already faced their 
fair share of tough conference competition, Thornqvist expects this weekend to be no dif-ferent. 
“Most of the time when we play, the team 
on the other side has nothing to lose,” he said. “They’re expected to lose to Florida, so they’re going to throw everything they have at us. …We have everything to lose.”

The UF men’s tennis team took care of 
business on Thursday night when it took 
the courts at the Alabama Tennis Stadium.
The No. 12 Gators (13-6, 6-1 SEC) ex-
tended their win streak to ﬁ  ve matches and currently sit in third place in the SEC standings. They trail behind Georgia and Texas A&M, who have undefeated confer-ence records.
Florida dominated its match with ‘Bama 
from the start, beginning with doubles play.
The upperclassmen captured the dou-
bles point for the Gators on Courts 2 and 3. Redshirt junior Joshua Wardell and ju-nior Chase Perez-Blanco won easily over ‘Bama’s Zhe Zhou and Edson Ortiz by a score of 6-1. Senior Maxx Lipman and El-liott Orkin were in a tight match with 
Thibault Cancel and Alexey Nesterov but 
pulled out the victory, 7-5.
The lone ranked matchup in doubles, 
featuring UF’s No. 6-ranked duo of Alfredo Perez and Johannes Ingildsen, ended un-decided at 6-6.
Florida was able to carry its momen-tum into singles play. However, slow starts came from UF’s captain, Orkin, and top-
ranked player, Perez.
Orkin captur the ﬁ  rst set, 7-6, while Per-
ez dropped the ﬁ  rst set to Mazen Osama, 
6-1. Osama faced off with Perez in doubles and is ranked 35th in the ITA rankings in singles play. Perez captured the second set 7-5; however, he and Orkin’s matches did not ﬁ  nish. Freshman Joseph Guillin’s match also ended undecided. Guillin was 
closing in on his fourth straight singles vic-
tory when the match was stopped at 6-3, 6-5. 
Despite slow starts on Courts 1 and 2, 
the strong play of Perez-Blanco and Ingild-sen helped the Gators get off to a fast start. Perez-Blanco swiftly defeated Ortiz by a tally of 6-2, 6-0. 
Meanwhile, Ingildsen took care of Nest-
erov, 6-3, 6-0.
Lipman secured the match for UF when 
he defeated the Tide’s Spencer Richey, 6-3, 7-6. 
“It was a good road win tonight in some 
windy, cool conditions,” coach Bryan Shel-ton said in a release. 
“I like the toughness our guys showed.” From Tuscaloosa, Florida will travel to Lexington to face Kentucky on Saturday at 1 p.m. The No. 24 Wildcats (13-8, 4-4 SEC) 
feature a lineup with the ITA 17th and 
24th-ranked players. 
“I am looking forward to another good practice tomorrow before we play Kentucky on Saturday,” Shelton said.

After two straight ﬁ  nishes outside of the 
top three, Florida bounced back and stole a 
win at the Schenkel tournament on March 19. Now, coach J.C. Deacon says the team is closer than ever to its top form. 
“I’m so excited about what’s going on 
with the guys. They’ve really come togeth-er like I haven’t seen since I’ve been here in Gainesville,” Deacon said in a release. 
“They’re tight, they’re pushing each other, 
and we’re close to being our best.”
Following the win, the Gators are hoping 
to ride their momentum to another victory, this time at the Mason Rudolph Champion-ship in Nashville, Tennessee. In order to do that, the Gators will have to go through top-ranked Vanderbilt at its home course. Twelve 
other teams will compete this weekend, as 
well, including Alabama and Missouri, which are both ranked in the top 50.
“We’re excited about going to Vanderbilt’s 
home course. They’re such a phenomenal program and team. They’ll be a really, really tough test.” Deacon said. “The guys know we have our work cut out for us, but at the same time, we are excited for the opportunity.”
A win this weekend will give the Gators 
their ﬁ  fth victory of the season, which would tie for the most wins in a season since 2010-11. To do that, the Gators will need some high-end performances from some of their 
key players. Last year, Sam Horsﬁ  eld and Gordon Neale, who are in the lineup this 
year, took the top two spots in the same tour-nament.
“I know a lot of guys have some good 
experiences and feelings from last year play-ing really well.” Deacon said. “The guys are excited to get back, and hopefully, we can move up the leaderboard that one spot we missed out on last year (when the team ﬁ  n-ished second).”
Andy Zhang, Ryan Orr and Alejandro Tos-
ti will join Horsﬁ  eld and Neale in the lineup. 
Tosti will rejoin the lineup after being held 
out of the Schenkel last week and could give the Gators another boost going into the week-end. He has four top-10 ﬁ  nishes this season. 
Ryan Celano will also compete as an indi-
vidual. Celano shot 6-over at the Schenkel as an individual, which tied him for 42nd.
The team will tee off this morning, start-
ing with Tosti around 9:20. Horsﬁ  eld will be 
the last one in the team lineup to take the 
course around 10 a.m., while Celano will tee off sometime around 10:25.

WOMEN’S GOLF
By Morgan McMullen
Sports Writer
“How do you make a hankie 
dance?” Kelly Grassel asked her teammates on Thursday. 
The team was loose as it took 
turns teeing off on a par-3 hole in Sunset, South Carolina, and assistant coach Janice Olivencia had asked the senior golfer for her “joke of the day.”
“You put a little boogie in it,” 
Grassel shouted on Periscope. She 
smiled wide and put on a little dance 
of her own. And why not? The Gators were in a dancing mood after winning their pre-vious two tourna-ments by wide 
margins.
Starting to-
day, however, the Gators will likely be more business-minded 
as they attempt to defend last sea-son’s championship at the Clemson Invitational. Last year, UF held off 
a late rally by eventual runner-up 
Furman, beating the Paladins by one stroke. This year, the ﬁ  eld includes 16 other teams, including four other SEC schools as well as FSU.The team has had success re-
cently in South Carolina. Ten days ago at the Briar’s Creek Invitational, 
three Gators ﬁ  nished in the top 10; 
seniors Karolina Vlckova, Maria Tor-res and Grassel carried the team to an 18-stroke victory over Campbell University.
For her efforts at Briar’s Creek, 
Torres was honored with her second SEC Women’s Golfer of the Week award in the past three weeks. The 
No. 2-ranked amateur golfer in the 
world, Torres ended up winning the top individual honors at Briar’s Creek, carding a 7-under par. It was the best ﬁ  nish of her senior year. Torres did not compete in the 
Clemson Invitational last year and will be looking to add one more sig-
nature ﬁ  nish to her already superla-
tive-laden season.
Both Grassel and Vlckova, ranked 
No. 10 and No. 33, respectively, among world amateurs, did com-pete last year, though, and they each found very different results. 
Vlckova ended her tournament 
run with a 4 under, posting one round 
above par. Grassel sandwiched an 
uncharacteristic 6-over second round between two even-par rounds. 
Coach Emily Glaser said that 
last year’s tournament, in which UF never trailed at the end of any of the three rounds, was a learning experi-ence for her team.
“I was really impressed with our 
toughness this weekend,” Glaser said after her squad ﬁ  nished last year. “It wasn’t our best day, but we fought hard all the way to the end, and it paid off.”
The Clemson Invitational is 
the ﬁ  nal test for the team before it heads to Birmingham, Alabama, on 
April 21 to participate in the SEC 
Championship.
