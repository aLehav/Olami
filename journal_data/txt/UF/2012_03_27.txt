A group of about 100 people 
protesting the death of Trayvon 
Martin marched from Turlington 
Plaza to the FBI’s downtown ofﬁ  ce 
Monday afternoon.
A month after Sanford police 
said George Zimmerman, 28, shot 
and killed unarmed Trayvon Mar-
tin, 17, some simmer with anger at the fact that Zimmerman hasn’t 
been charged with a crime.
The protest 
was inspired by the Feb. 26 inci-dent, when San-
ford police said 
Trayvon was walking home from the store, 
carrying a packet of Skittles and an 
iced tea. 
Zimmerman called police and 
told them he was following a per-
son who looked suspicious. 
The two fought and Zimmer-
man shot Trayvon.
Zimmerman told police he act-
ed in self-defense.
Under Florida’s Stand Your Ground law, citizens have the right to use deadly force in self-defense 
if they are attacked in a place they have a right to be.
Florida is one of 24 states with 
similar self-defense laws — stat-utes that have been called into 
question in the aftermath of the 
Trayvon Martin case.“There is no reason why I 
shouldn’t be able to walk out my front door because I’m black or 
Asian or Hispanic,” said 22-year-old Jarrod Allen, a UF political sci-ence senior and protester. 
Across the country Thursday, 
demonstrators, including those at UF, called for Zimmerman’s arrest and a full investigation into how the Sanford Police Department 
conducted the case.
Chrisley Carpio, 20, planned the 
event after organizers at Florida 
State University and Florida A&M 
University, who also held protests 
today, contacted her.
 She said she’s infuriated that 
Zimmerman remains a free man.
“I was too outraged not to do 
something,” the history sopho-more said. “It ended up organiz-ing itself.”
About 25 people gathered at 
1:15 p.m. 
Thirty minutes later, the num-
ber swelled to more than 125.
Diana Moreno, 24, UF alumna, 
was one of the protesters. 
She said she experienced rac-
ism ﬁ  rsthand when she moved to 
America; people would make fun

� BOB HARRINGTON IS      
CLAIMING SELF-DEFENSE.

Jim Haskins was watching the local 
news Sunday evening when he heard 
three thuds. He thought someone was stacking lumber at the Small World Day-care behind his apartment. His neighbor, 
Bill Bates, knew better.
Bates was in the courtyard at Bailey 
Village in the 1300 block of Northwest 
Sixth Street when he heard three quick pops — bam bam bam. The sounds came from Apartment 2 on the second ﬂ  oor where Bob Harrington and Allan Reimer had been all day, laughing and arguing and drinking.
Harrington shot Reimer three times 
soon after 7 p.m. Sunday, and Gainesville Police found Reimer, 51, dead at the scene. Ofﬁ  cers interviewed Harrington, but he had not been charged as of Mon-day afternoon, GPD spokeswoman Cpl. Angelina Valuri said.
Police have not yet released an ofﬁ  -
cial report, though neighbors have theo-ries as to what exactly happened in Har-rington’s apartment. Soon after talking to ofﬁ  cers Sunday night, Harrington told 
some people in the courtyard he shot Re-
imer in self-defense.
Harrington told Bates he walked out 
of his bathroom, his pants around his an-kles, when Reimer attacked. He choked Harrington, kneed him the face and kicked his teeth in, Bates said, and one side of Harrington’s face looked bruised Sunday night.
Bates said he believes Reimer wanted 
to rob Harrington. Reimer told neigh-bors he was packing up soon and head-ing west to Montana. He wanted to be a cattle rancher, Bates said, and he might Man killed friend in shootingSEE PROTEST, PAGE 4

Jessica Sweeb, a 20-year-old family, youth and community sciences sophomore, said she plans to register to take anatomy and physiol-ogy during Summer A and ﬁ  nancial account-ing during Summer C.
Sweeb said she enjoys the relaxed campus 
atmosphere in the summer, and she can focus more on her classes.
Last year, about 28,688 students signed up

Students have three weeks 
left to file their taxes.
This year, taxes are due 
April 17, two days later than 
normal. April 15 is a Sunday, 
and April 16 falls on Eman-
cipation Day in Washington, D.C.
Students looking for help 
filing their taxes can con-tact the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance Program, or VITA, which offers free help.
VITA helps individuals 
and families who make less than $50,000, according to the Internal Revenue Service.
Students can make ap-
pointments by calling 211.
United Way North Flor -
ida VITA coordinator Dave Sheppard said anyone with a total income of less than $9,500 is not legally required to file taxes. However, a filed tax form is required for anyone in this category who wants a refund of withheld money.
VITA has 11 Gainesville 
locations, according to the United Way website. One is at Levin College of Law, and another is at Shands at UF. The list of locations and hours is available through a link on getyourEITC.com.
Jesse Boyles, UF associ-
ate professor at the Fisher 
School of Accounting, said 
Bright Futures goes toward tuition and is tax-free. If part of a scholarship or fellow-ship goes toward non-aca-demic expenses, however, it counts as income, according to the IRS.

Struggling to pay for tuition, two college students came up 
with a way to play their bills away.
Dimitri Sillam and Mikhael Naayem’s website Grantoo, 
a free social gaming website where students play games and 
win money for college, launched at UF on Sunday.
By May 15, any student with an email address ending in 
.edu will be able to register on Grantoo. On the site, students can enter gaming tournaments to win money. They must do-nate at least 10 percent of their winnings to a charity.
“Grantoo believes that involving students in charitable giv-ing will encourage lifelong generosity and social awareness,” 
said Grantoo marketing guru Sally Kallet.
Grants and prizes are provided by corporate sponsorships 
and local businesses, one of which is Grooveshark, Kallet 
said.
The amount of each grant is determined by each sponsor’s 
donation and the number of students playing in the tourna-ment.
The minimum sponsor donation is $5,000. Sponsors choose 
how the money will be divided, so more than one student and charity can benefit.
Students can also play games without registering for tour -
naments and win coupons or product samples, such as free slices of pizza or T-shirts from local businesses.
There is no limit to how much money a student can win. 
However, if the same students keep winning, Grantoo will in-tervene so others have a chance to win, Kallet said.
Currently , the website offers three games: Quiz Night, 
a trivia game; Wordy Bird, a crossword game; and Grantoo Hold ‘Em, a poker game. More games are being developed.Website offers chance for students to win money by playing games
“The ability to just play an online game 
and earn money for a charity of my choice is        
awesome.”

She walked around with a sandwich board sign that read, “I 
am not dangerous. Racism is. #justicefortrayvon.”
A man who declined to be identified approached Moreno 
and defended Zimmerman’s claim of self-defense. 
The conversation grew heated, and Moreno’s voice cracked.
“It’s an emotional incident,” she said, and she pointed to the 
unidentified man as he walked away. “These are the people who carry guns and look at everyone like suspects.”
Speeches on Turlington began over a bullhorn at about 1:30 
p.m, and the group walked to the Institute of Black Culture an hour later, while police stopped traffic in all four lanes of Uni-versity Avenue at Northwest 15th Street.
Kevin Jenkins, a 30-year-old Ph.D. student, 
spoke to the crowd at the institute and urged them to express their angst this fall at the polls.
“This is the time to exercise your right to 
vote,” Jenkins said to a chorus of agreement. “That’s when we’ll have justice.”
The crowd crossed University Avenue 
again, and then walked in the avenue’s right 
lane one mile to the FBI’s downtown office.
Police blocked off all the intersections in the protesters’ path, 
including the one at University Avenue and Southwest 13th Street.
Once the group arrived at the FBI office, Jenkins urged pro-
testers not to enter the building, and demonstrators decided to send a delegation of 15 people inside.
Dave Schneider, UF Fall ‘11 alumnus, said he handed a list 
of demands to officials that included the arrest of George Zim-
merman, permanently firing Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee and 
urging the FBI to investigate the killing as a racially motivated hate crime.

A new track at Fred Cone Park, located at 2841 E University Ave., gives students a free place to run.
� FORMER MAYOR FRED 
CONE DONATED THE LAND FOR THE PARK.
LORI PERRY
Alligator Contributing Writer
Students looking for a place to jog 
can head down University Avenue 
to a new track at Fred Cone Park.
The highlight of the new facil-
ity is its eight-lane, competition-
quality, 440-meter track and interior 
field, which includes space for field events such as pole vault, shot put, high jump and long jump.
The facility includes bleachers for 
viewing the track and field, as well as parking.
The official celebration of the fa-
cility is at 10 a.m. Thursday at the 
park, 2841 E University Ave. The 
park and its new track have been open for about a month.
“We have a lot more parking 
than the UF track has,” said Thomas Hawkins, Gainesville city commis-sioner. “Every UF student is wel-come to use our public parks.”
Gainesville high schools will 
be able to use the public facility for sports practice.
The project was funded through 
the Wild Spaces Public Places half-cent sales tax, which was approved by voters in 2008, Hawkins said.
According to a news release, the 
original contract for the facility was for about $1.5 million.
The facility offers a variety of ac-
tivities to park visitors.
“It’s really a top-notch facility for 
sprinting, running and all kinds of exercise,” Hawkins said. “It’s fan-tastic to have in east Gainesville. It is 
really exciting to see it.”
The track is a major asset to the 
park, but it is one aspect of the over -
all vision for the park, said Scherwin 
Henry, Gainesville city commis-sioner.
The park is home to a library, bas-
ketball courts and refurbished base-ball and softball fields.
“Eventually , we would like a 
kids’ splash pad added there as well,” Henry said.
Fred Cone, a former mayor and 
commissioner who served in the 1940s, donated the land for Fred Cone Park, said Michelle Park, as-sistant director of Gainesville parks, recreation and cultural affairs.Fred Cone Park includes competition-quality track and field

Resident: Both men ‘drank all day, all night’
have needed money before moving.
“Everybody knew Allan was 
gonna go off,” Bates said. “You could 
just sense it. You could feel it.”
If Harrington acted in self-de-
fense, he would be protected under Florida’s Stand Your Ground Law, which has drawn national scrutiny after the killing of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed teenager who died last month after a neighborhood watch-man shot him.
But at least one Bailey Village 
resident, Barry Eastman, doubts 
Harrington’s story . Harrington is 
about 50 pounds heavier than Reim-er was, and he was known as one of the toughest men in the complex.
“Nobody could beat him,” East-
man said. “I’m surprised to hear this guy came up there to rob him. 
… I don’t understand how he could 
even try to rob him.”
Yes, Reimer was an alcoholic, 
Eastman said. He challenged neigh-bors from time to time. But Har -
rington liked to drink, too, and he could have just as easily been at fault.
While he was doing his laundry 
Sunday afternoon, Eastman said he heard Harrington and Reimer chat-ting for hours.
“These guys drank all day , all 
night,” Eastman said. “They would love each other then fight each oth-er. That’s not a good cocktail.”
Most of the residents at Bailey 
Village are retired military veter -
ans, and they bring with them all the mental and physical battle scars 
— Harrington served two tours in 
Vietnam — and Bates said he thinks Reimer is a veteran of the Persian Gulf War.
“Thinkin’ about the war will 
make you go crazy , just like livin’ ’round here,” Bates said. “Every-body’s got their own problems, their own mental issues. Everybody goes off sometimes. Even me.”
Still, Bates insists Bailey Village 
isn’t usually violent. The neighbors are close. They look out for each other. Every couple weeks, Bates barbecues about 40 pounds of pork and beef for any neighbors looking for free food.
Bates calls himself the “go-to 
guy” in the apartment complex. If anybody needs salt or sugar or 
cream for their coffee, they go to 
him. Sometimes, he gives it away . Other times, he sells it.
A couple months back, Bates said, 
he even sold Harrington a gun.
Harrington did not answer the 
door Monday night when an Alliga-tor reporter knocked.

William G. “Bill” Luttge, the founding executive 
director of UF’s McKnight Brain Institute, died Sat-
urday at Shands at UF. He was 68.
Luttge’s wife of 47 years, Michaelyn Chacon Lut-
tge, two sons and other family members were with him. The neuroscientist was diagnosed in January with multiple myeloma, which is a cancer of plasma 
cells in bone marrow, according to a news release.
During the 33 years he worked for the university, 
Luttge helped create and cultivate the institute. He 
also served as chairman of the department of neu-roscience, received the College of Medicine’s Life-
time Achievement Award in 2003 and was named an Honorary Alumnus.
Luttge retired in 2004 and pursued his love for 
nature, according to the release.
The day after his “escape from 
work,” as his personal website puts it, he started hiking the Appa-
lachian Trail in Georgia. His trail nickname was “FireBall” because of his endless energy and love for 
eating Atomic Fireballs candies while hiking.
Memorial donations can be 
made to the UF Foundation, McK-
night Brain Institute. Donors can write “Dr. Luttge” 
on the memo line.

Students who live off campus 
and can’t ﬁ  nd the time to shop for 
groceries now have an alternative to standing in the checkout lines in Gainesville.
The College Cuisine, a food de-
livery service that caters to college students in off-campus apartments, recently became available to UF stu-dents.
When students order meal plans 
on The College Cuisine website, the company organizes packages of 25 to 26 LiveSmart meals from 
Schwan’s Home Service.
The food is delivered to students’ 
apartment complexes every two 
weeks. Most of the meals are frozen or refrigerated.
Karen Schmidt, founder of the 
New Smyrna Beach-based compa-ny , said she came up with the idea when her daughter left for college in 
Orlando.
Schmidt’s daughter, Lynde, was 
living in an off-campus apartment 
for the ﬁ  rst time, and Schmidt said she wanted to ﬁ  nd a way to help keep healthy food in her kitchen.
“I thought there would be a lot 
of other students in her situation,” she said. “There’s shopping, plan-ning, budgeting and cooking meals, and sometimes students don’t have time to cook and start relying on fast food.”
Schmidt said she expanded her 
company after she started receiving calls and interest from students at other universities.
The College Cuisine began at the 
University of Central Florida, Valen-cia College, Rollins College, Semi-nole State College of Florida and Full Sail University in January.
The service became available to 
UF students last month, she said.
The College Cuisine offers six 
meal plan packages to choose from. All of the packages include break-fast, lunch, dinner, desserts and snacks. Some food options include biscuits, mufﬁ  ns, pizza, pasta, ham-burgers, smoothies and ice cream.
Prices range from about $90 to 
$100, depending on the package.
Jorge Chavez, a 21-year-old mi-
crobiology senior at UF, said he would try the off-campus meal plan, but he is not sure he would stick with it for a whole semester.
“I usually buy frozen food, but 
the packages seem expensive for only two weeks,” he said. “I usu-ally only spend around $50 a week 
when I eat out and around $30 when 
I shop for food.”Food delivery service 
offers grocery alternative
“ ... sometimes students 
don’t have time to cook and 
start relying on fast food.”

Caught on Tape
Filming police 
should be protected
This week, the Supreme Court began hearing arguments 
surrounding the individual mandate, which is part of 
the controversial health care reform law. However, 
within the next few years, the court will likely be ruling on 
another extremely important issue, especially for civil liber -
tarians.
In the age of YouTube and citizen journalism, questions 
have emerged about whether ordinary citizens are legally 
able to film or photograph on-duty police officers during 
events like traffic stops and arrests.
On March 14 in Philadelphia, Temple University photo-
journalism student Ian Van Kuyk was arrested and eventu-ally charged with obstruction of justice, resisting arrest and 
disorderly conduct.
Van Kuyk’s “crime” was taking pictures of a traffic stop 
that occurred outside of his home. The student, in compliance with police, took pictures without a flash and obeyed com -
mands from the officers to move back.
When officers told Van Kuyk to stop taking pictures, the 
student refused. He was then allegedly shoved, thrown to the 
ground and then handcuffed by the police.
His girlfriend, who was at the scene, was charged with ob-
struction and disorderly conduct when she tried to grab the 
camera, which was property of Temple University.
In New Jersey, 17-year-old honor student Khaliah Fitch-
ette found herself handcuffed and detained after she used her cellphone to film police boarding a bus as they responded to 
a collapsed man. When police asked Fitchette to stop filming, 
she refused. She was arrested and taken to the city’s juvenile 
processing center.
In August of last year, the First Circuit Court of Appeals 
in New England ruled, “The filming of government officials engaged in their duties in a public place, including police of-
ficers performing their responsibilities … serves a cardinal First Amendment interest in protecting and promoting the free discussion of governmental affairs.”
This ruling came after Simon Gilk was arrested for us-
ing his cellphone video camera to capture police brutality by Boston police officers. Although charges were eventually 
dropped, the ACLU filed a lawsuit to protect the right of citi-
zens to document instances of police misconduct.
If and when a case like this reaches the Supreme Court, 
we hope the justices will rule in favor of our right to film and document police officers while they are on duty.
Of course there should be limits on our ability to harass 
or interfere with police activity, but to completely restrict our power to document and spread information about police mis-conduct threatens the liberty of everyone.
Not only will a ruling in favor of our First Amendment 
rights secure the freedom of people to document police, but it will also ensure that the rights of those who are subjected to 
police brutality are protected as well.
After all, someone must watch the watchmen.Some are too quick to make racism claims 
The limits of what constitutes a racist act are too liber -
ally defined today. With a heightened sensitivity to 
racial inequality, we’ve become overzealous when 
classifying things as racist.
Racism is no longer strictly a matter of prejudicial 
intent; it has become a term used to classify any case in which the parties simply have different heritages.
As a white male, I’m loosely entitled to reference the 
oppressed side of oppression (though still racism, “re-verse” racism is hardly impactful), but I am entitled to examine where and when shouts of racism are heard and whether or not they are justified.
The shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin has further 
fueled concerns of racism, police misconduct and faulty legislation, many of which were left dormant through false securities and complacency.
Does this case classify as a hate crime?Did the police baselessly stereotype Martin in favor of 
George Zimmerman, his white-Hispanic killer?
The answers, I think, are “no” and “yes” respectively, 
though the questions asked are already loaded.
Because the killing occurred across racial boundaries, it 
automatically qualifies as a hate crime in the perceptions of many.
Yet, a white man kills a white man, a black man kills a 
black man, and no one questions whether race is a factor.
Surely, Zimmerman stereotyped Martin (that much can 
be heard in his 911 call, in which he claimed that Martin appeared to be suspicious and on drugs), but I wonder if he would have been much less suspicious if I were the one roaming the streets of his community at night with my hood up.
What was the cause of Zimmerman’s suspicion? That 
Martin’s face was black or that he could hardly see his face at all?
The issue of the hoodie is central in this case. Despite 
my disgust for almost everything that spews out from un-der Geraldo Rivera’s mustache, I think his claim about the threat-ening nature of hoodies is accu-rate.
If I’m out at night and I’m 
approached by a woman in fish-nets, pumps and makeup that’s an inch thick, I assume she’s a prostitute (or in a sorority). If I’m approached by a man in a tan 
trench coat scanning frantically, I assume he might flash me. If I’m approached by a guy with his hood up (in Flori-da in late February, when a hoodie is about as practical as a snow plow) I would be wise to be cautious.
That is not to say that Zimmerman should have stalked 
Martin as he did. The “night watchman” has obvious in-securities, but he was not unreasonable for being initially suspicious of Martin’s intentions (just as he would be if it were me roaming the streets with my hood up).
My concern is what or from where our tendency to see 
things as racial issues comes from. In Zimmerman’s 911 call, he had to be asked the race of the man he was fol-lowing. 
The case is tragic and obviously must make us reassess 
our self-defense laws and investigate the prevalence of po-lice misconduct. If there is a clear case of racism here, it is in the officers’ assumption that Martin was not a resident of the neighborhood, not in Zimmerman’s heightened sus-picion.
The officers may have stereotyped based on Martin’s 
race, but accusations of Zimmerman’s bigotry are un-founded, and frankly hint at the inherent bigotry in those who are accusing.
It seems that, in viewing the case in hindsight, we are 
the ones tainting these issues with calls of racism.

Murders the result of psychological     
issues, not religious extremism
I am disturbed, saddened and ashamed 
at the barbaric killing of seven innocent 
people, including three children, in Tou-
louse, France, that occurred Tuesday. The 
individuals killed were at a Jewish school. 
Mohamed Merah, the perpetrator, is a 
legal French citizen of Algerian origin. He 
has been brainwashed by al-Qaida.
The sad reality is that this killing re-
ﬂ  ects more how Islam is perceived as a vi-
olent religion with anti-Semitic Muslims. We Muslims need to acknowledge that a serious disease of hatred, violence and in-stant revenge has seeped into many who call themselves Muslims. 
There’s no doubt that extremism among 
a few Muslims is a problem. But it is impor-tant to realize that its motives are usually politically based, and religion is wrapped up with it an ugly way.
I cannot neglect to discuss Staff Sgt. 
Robert Bales, an American army sergeant accused of slaughtering 17 Afghan civil-ians and admitting to it — an incident that occurred two weeks ago. Yet, Merah was 
raised in a wholesome household in Wash-ington, according to The New York Times. 
He was described as a polite neighbor turned down by the French army, accord-ing to the Guardian.
We should all pause for serious reﬂ  ec-
tion on these two horrible, shocking inci-dents.
Both men have serious psychological 
issues that would not cause normal peo-ple to commit such heinous acts. These are disturbed individuals, and we cannot necessarily point the ﬁ  nger at U.S. foreign policy. 
Please, let’s not over-generalize about all Muslims being terrorists because both men, of different faiths, committed terror-ist acts.
Unfortunately, human beings can be ig-
norant and easily emotionally aroused be-ings. It is human nature to hurt those you hate, demonizing individuals one does wrong to — but it is only human nature 
to forgive and resolve conﬂ  ict. The latter 
takes time and effort. Patience takes cour-age and steadfastness. Do we have these qualities in these tumultuous times?

The U.S. Supreme Court came to a smart deci-
sion on Wednesday by ruling that “criminal defendants have a constitutional right to ef-
fective lawyers during plea negotiations,” as The New York Times reported.
Criminal defendants deserve to face a more for-
mal and regulated process of plea-bargaining. 
Whether or not the defendant is guilty, he or she 
still needs to be able to see all of his or her options as clearly as possible.
In that same article, the need for effective law-
yers boils down to the fact “that what used to be 
informal and unregulated dealmaking is now sub-
ject to new constraints when bad legal advice leads defendants to reject favorable plea offers.”
The importance of guilty pleas is obvious when 
looking at the numbers. 
According to The New York Times, about 97 
percent of federal convictions resulted from guilty pleas, with 94 percent in state convictions for 2006.
These plea deals decide whether people spend a 
year or a decade in prison. 
Whether the general public agrees with what the 
defendant did or not, there is a reason that these policies exist.
The Sixth Amendment guarantees a fair trial, but 
the word “fair” can be incredibly subjective. 
Many court cases from centuries ago are still 
analyzed, but that is what is supposed to happen. The U.S. Supreme Court does not deal with open-
and-shut cases.This decision confronts 
the idea of ﬁ  xing the system. 
The court system and its 
many operators do great 
work for the nation. 
This decision to expand the protections of crimi-
nal defendants just shows how much more attor-
neys can do.
No one is getting thrown under the bus — in-
stead, the highest court in the United States is ad-mitting that there still needs to be ﬁ  ne-tuning.
Decisions by the Supreme Court don’t just af-
fect the people directly impacted by the outcome 
of what they implement. Every case sets precedent 
and brings up new questions. 
The judiciary branch of the federal government 
is independent of Congress, separated from politi-cal squabbles.
Furthermore, these judges are not dealing with 
just the imminent present but also centuries to come. 
Pointing out what needs ﬁ  xing seems like a smart 
move from a judicial body that deals with so many controversial cases.
If all of the states can listen and try to alter the 
judicial system in a positive direction, this ruling will not just help those who plead guilty, it will also 
help everyday people see transparency in a govern-
ment that needs it.

Wildcat at the University of Arizona.Supreme Court’s ruling shows 
justice system willing to reformUWire
Brought to you by the same state that found Casey Anthony 
not-guilty of murder, ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the Trayvon Martin case.
Are we really that surprised?Apparently , wearing a hoodie and holding Skittles and an iced 
tea merits enough suspicion to be shot and killed by the question-able neighborhood watchdog.
George Zimmerman, of Sanford, took the life of the 17-year-old, 
claiming that the teen “looks like he is up to no good,” on a record-ing with a police dispatcher that night.
Zimmerman’s story goes that he was acting out of “self-defense” 
against the unarmed teen with a squeaky-clean criminal record. He has yet to be arrested due to a lack of evidence — the same song that kept Anthony out of the big house.
Granted, Zimmerman has a right to a fair trial, but he must un-
dergo tough and thorough questioning. No one has the right to take the life of someone’s child without a serious investigation.
The incident has since incensed the nation. Services and rallies 
are being held in cities across the country in Trayvon’s honor, be-ginning in Miami, his hometown, and Sanford, where his father’s girlfriend lived.
The Miami Heat took photographs earlier this week to take a 
stand against the apparent injustice. Even President Obama ex-
pressed his sympathy for Trayvon’s family.
“If I had a son, he’d look like Trayvon,” the president said.
Trayvon could have been anyone’s son, brother, cousin or 
friend. He could have been a fellow UF student. He was just a normal kid walk-ing home from the store.
A few students set up a table on Turl-
ington Plaza earlier this week calling for justice for Trayvon’s death. If justice is 
never reached, then I hope the student 
group continues to seek a more fair, thor-ough justice system.
Another innocent life cannot be taken 
and forgotten while a guilty one lives freely.
The incident has triggered heavy debate over hot issues: gun 
control (particularly Florida’s “Stand Your Ground” law), race and the skewed justice system.
Zimmerman was licensed to carry a concealed ﬁ  rearm, but 
this incident prompts another look at our gun laws. The Second Amendment protects the right to bear arms, but does it go so far as to protect those who have the motive to kill?
I hope that Zimmerman’s decision to ﬁ  re on Trayvon is unre-
lated to race, as Zimmerman himself is half-Latino. I’d like to think that, in our modern and increasingly tolerant world, race did not play a factor in his hasty decision; though — let’s face it — it very well may have.
Florida Gov . Rick Scott has partnered with the state Department 
of Law Enforcement to assemble a task force to look into the shoot-ing. All eyes are on Florida to make sure justice is sought for the teen.
But after all the hype dies down, Trayvon’s life was still lost — 
and nothing can bring the young man back. All those other issues, even when they are resolved and laws are made and amended, will never help replace the life of the 17-year-old.
Sadly, Trayvon isn’t the ﬁ  rst and won’t be the last teenager to be 
killed in a situation like this. As citizens, we have to put our faith 
(however little it may be) into the justice system and continue to 
call for fair trials that take a good look at the evidence. All that can be done to save another young life must be done.

UWire� A DECISION IS EXPECTED 
IN LATE JUNE.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
WASHINGTON — Supreme 
Court justices signaled Monday they 
are ready to confront questions at the heart of challenges to President Barack Obama’s historic health care 
overhaul. Virtually every American 
will be affected by the outcome, due this summer.
On the ﬁ  rst of three days of ar-
guments — the longest in decades — none of the justices appeared to embrace the contention that it was too soon for a decision.
Outside the courtroom demon-
strators on both sides voiced their ea-gerness for the court to either uphold or throw out the largest expansion in the nation’s social safety net since Medicare was enacted in 1965.
Tuesday’s arguments will focus 
on the heart of the case, the provision that aims to extend medical insur-ance to 30 million more Americans 
by requiring everyone to carry insur-
ance or pay a penalty.
A decision is expected by late 
June as Obama ﬁ  ghts for re-election. All of his Republican challengers op-pose the law and promise its repeal if the high court hasn’t struck it down in the meantime.
On Monday , the justices took on 
the question of whether an obscure tax law could derail the case. The 19th century law bars tax disputes from being heard in the courts before the taxes have been paid.
Under the new health care law, 
Americans who don’t purchase health insurance would have to re-
port that omission on their tax re-
turns for 2014 and would pay a pen-alty along with federal income tax on returns due by April 2015. Among the issues facing the court is whether that penalty is a tax.
Solicitor General Donald Verrilli 
Jr., defending the health law, urged the court to focus on what he called “the issues of great moment.” The 26 states and a small business group challenging the law want the court to go ahead and decide on its constitu-tionality without delay.
But one lower court that heard 
the case, the federal appeals court in Richmond, Va., has said the challenge is premature. No justice seemed likely to buy that argument Monday.8, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, MARCH 27, 2012

Three UF student-run startup compa-
nies won thousands of dollars in cash prizes 
and services at the Entrepreneurship Club’s Fourth Annual Venture Pitch Competition on Monday.
The UF Entrepreneurship Club hosted the 
competition at the Florida Innovation Hub at UF.
Nine companies in the club pitched their 
startups to six judges, who were all potential investors.
First place went to Partender, a software 
that reduces the amount of time it takes to do liquor inventory from six hours to 30 minutes 
or less. It increases the accuracy of measure-
ment of alcohol in a bottle.The company won $5,000 for legal servic-
es from Edwards Wildman, $500 from Wolf Greenﬁ  eld, three hours of free limo service from Fabulous Coach Lines and 14 hours of human resource services and consulting from FloridaWorks.
Nikhil Kundra and Alisa Wills, co-found-
ers of Partender, started the company in No-vember.
“The legal services can be used for any-
thing, and the idea of giving back to our team is perfect,”  said Kundra, a 22-year-old entre-preneurship master’s student.
Valerie Sheehan, president of the UF En-
trepreneurship Club and event coordinator at the Innovation Hub, said she’s proud of the companies’ work ethics.
“We’ve been trying to get the club where it 
needs to be and create jobs,” she said. “Some of the members stay up all night and go with-out sleep.”
Second place went to ParkSharp, an online 
marketplace for event parking spots.
ParkSharkp CEO Matt Carroll, 23, said the 
idea is useful for game days in Gainesville when people sell parking spots in their drive-ways and on their lawns. Sellers can state 
what they think their parking spots are worth 
and buyers can state what they are willing to pay.
Carroll, a digital arts and sciences master’s student, said he’s excited about winning sec-ond place in the competition, especially since the company is only 10 days old.
“A lot of what we got were legal services, 
and we deﬁ  nitely need those the most,” he said.
Pick.It, a tool that helps businesses retrieve 
marketing data for their products, won third place.
Brian Johnson, who works for Microsoft 
and helped judge the competition, said he was impressed by the quality of the presenta-tions from the students.
“The big thing of whether or not the com-
panies are going to be successful is the drive of the entrepreneurs that created the compa-nies,” he said. “I think the ideas are really that good, and it’s going to take that kind of per-
son to drive them to success.”

  For left-handed reliever Steven 
“Paco” Rodriguez, being the No. 1 
team in the nation means more than just a 22-2 record and national ac-claim. 
  As one of 29 native Floridians 
who suits up for the Gators, Ro-driguez said being the best in the country always reverts back to be-ing the best in the state, where UF holds rivalries with No. 12 Miami 
and No. 4 Florida State. 
  “It’s us against them,” Rodri-
guez said. “We’re on the top right 
now, so it’s basically we’ve got to go out there and show them we’re the best.”  So far this year, the Gators have 
done just that. They swept an early-season series at Miami before han-dling FSU 9-2 two weeks ago at 
McKethan Stadium. The latter isn’t 
unusual for Florida. Since coach Kevin O’Sullivan took over the pro-gram following the 2006-07 season, the Gators have gone 5-0 against the Seminoles at The Mac.   But tonight’s game isn’t being 
played on Stadium Road. It will take place at the Baseball Grounds of Jacksonville at 7, and if the past 
ﬁ  ve seasons hold true, that may not 
bode well for the Gators. 
  While Florida is 5-0 against FSU 
at home under O’Sullivan, it is 1-11 when the game is played elsewhere. The series of midweek games has generally rotated between Jackson-ville, Tallahassee and Tampa when not in Gainesville. Two of those losses eliminated the Gators from 
postseason play, as the Seminoles 
knocked them out in the 2008 Tal-lahassee Regional and the 2010 Col-lege World Series.

  Life without Tyler Thompson is 
proving to be more difﬁ  cult for Florida than anyone could have 
imagined.
  It’s not often you hear those words 
when speaking about the loss of a career 
.280 hitter who averages one strikeout 
every 3.2 at-bats. Still, that’s the case with 
Thompson, who tore his ACL rounding ﬁ  rst base March 16 against Vanderbilt.
  Despite the fact Thompson was on 
pace for a career season at the plate, Flor-ida’s senior center ﬁ  elder has never been much of a threat offensively . He has, however, been the most con-sistent defen-sive outﬁ  elder on the roster.
  In 154 career 
games, Thomp-
son sports a 
.995 ﬁ  elding 
percentage, committing just one error in 183 attempts. Although he has never re-corded an assist on a putout, he has been about as reliable as it comes.Thompson’s injury hurting 
more than UF anticipated   SPRING FOOTBALL

 Alligator Staff Writer
 
  It’s hard to view Ronald Powell’s ﬁ  rst two 
seasons at Florida as anything better than a 
disappointment. 
  Powell came to UF as the No. 1 overall 
recruit in the class of 2010, but his produc-tion has yet to live up to the hype. Although 
the junior Buck linebacker totaled a team-
high six sacks in 2011, the majority of those 
came as the result of strong pass coverage 
or on plays where the opposing quarterback 
moved into his path. The Gators struggled to 
generate pressure off the edge for the major-ity of the season, and much of the blame fell 
on Powell. 
  But, if early reports out of spring practice 
are any indication, Powell is taking strides in 
the right direction.
  Coach Will Muschamp said Powell was the defensive player of the day in Saturday’s scrimmage, the team’s ﬁ  rst of the year. 
  “He had the most production of anybody 
up front, and of anybody, really,” Muschamp 
said. 
  Powell had a sack, a couple third-down 
stops and some good pressures, according to 
Muschamp. 
  Muschamp added that 
Powell has had a good offseason, working hard 
to improve his pad level, hand placement and ability 
to play against blocks — 
criticisms that have been 
talking points throughout 
Powell’s ﬁ  rst two seasons. 
  “Just overall pleased with his effort and 
everything he’s trying to do,” Muschamp  Powell improving, Muschamp says

Quotable
“You don’t ever know. It’s kind of like when you take your car to a mechanic and he starts 
talking about the dual over-cam carburetor. Well, I don’t really know, you just need to ﬁ  x it.” 
Will Muschamp 
UF football coach (on CB Marcus Roberson’s neck injury)said. 
Run game on point: Despite 
Powell’s work on the defensive 
end, Muschamp said Florida’s of-
fense still had a successful day running the ball. 
The main architect of that rush-
ing attack was Mike Gillislee, who was named the offensive player of 
the day and is close to cementing 
himself as the team’s No. 1 back heading into the fall. “If he continues down the same 
path, there’s no question,” Mus-
champ said. 
While Gillislee’s abilities as a 
downhill runner have been on 
display for some time, he also did well in pass protection Saturday, Muschamp said.  
Gillislee made a few highlight 
plays in the game, including a 20-yard run on the first series when he 
made a strong cut that caused two 
defenders to miss. 
“He continues to have a re-
ally good spring and a productive spring,” Muschamp said. “Got the 
ball north and south, did a nice job. He’s got good vision, a good feel 
for the running game.”
Quarterback competition: 
Muschamp said “nobody really 
distanced themselves as far as the 
quarterback position” during the scrimmage. Jacoby Brissett, Jeff 
Driskel and Tyler Murphy all con-
tinue to split reps, and each had a 
few bright spots on Saturday. 
Brissett and Driskel both had 
completion percentages around 
60, but Muschamp stressed the need for better accuracy, especially 
in third-down situations.
Muschamp specifically praised 
his quarterbacks’ ability to manage the huddle and avoid procedural 
issues in the first scrimmage after 
only six days of practice. 
Freshmen a mixed bag: Flori-
da’s coach also doled out compli-
ments to a few early enrollees. Al-though neither started Saturday, offensive linemen D.J. Humphries 
and Jessamen Dunker were both commended for their talent and 
athleticism. 
Linebacker Antonio Morrison 
drew compliments as a “physical, tough, instinctive linebacker that’s done some nice things,” while 
wide receiver Latroy Pittman was 
perhaps the biggest surprise of the 
bunch. 
“Pittman is a guy who is really 
coming on and doing a nice job,” Muschamp said. 
“He’s still swimming a little bit 
mentally, which is to be expected, 
but he’s physical, he mixes it in well, he’s made some plays down 
the field for us. …  I’ve been very 
pleased with his progress to this 
point, I really have.”
Muschamp tagged Pittman as a 
hard worker and someone whose 
strength and physicality exceeds 
what would normally be expected 
of a freshman. 
Not all of the freshman reviews 
were positive. Muschamp said 
defensive back Willie Bailey has 
speed, length and coverage ability 
but needs to get physically stron-
ger. 
Muschamp also mentioned de-
fensive tackle Damien Jacobs’ need to become more consistent, a criti-
cism that has popped up again and 
again this spring. 
The only significant injury to 
come from the weekend was to de-fensive end Earl Okine, who will 
miss the rest of spring with a back 
problem. Okine appeared in all 13 games last season, recording eight 
tackles.

Gillislee shines in scrimmage; Driskel, Brissett still battling for job
FOOTBALL , from page 13Florida in those 11 defeats, outscor -
ing the Gators by a total of 75-37.
The benefits of playing at home 
are obvious, but the Gators gener -
ally enjoy their greatest home-field 
advantage when the Seminoles are 
in town. The first meeting between the two teams this season registered a sellout and set a McKethan Stadi-um attendance record (6,005). 
“We don’t usually get too caught 
up in that, but we really appreciate the support,” junior shortstop No-lan Fontana said. 
Fontana admitted there’s not too 
much to the contrast between play-ing FSU at home and on the road but did hint that the current confidence Florida is playing with should help the team survive the bus trips. 
“We’ll just try to do what we did 
tonight and just execute the small things because they turn into big 
things and big innings,” he said af-ter the first meeting. “As long as we 
do that as a team, we’ll be alright.”
What the Gators did to handily 
take Game 1 was fairly standard and in line with why they have been so good all season. The bullpen gave up only two hits during 6.1 innings of work, allowing the bats to build 
up nine unanswered runs after Flor -
ida fell behind 2-0 
in the third in-ning. UF’s offense scored runs in five of the last six in-nings. The effort was led by the 
Nos. 1-4 hitters, 
who drove in all 
nine runs. 
Etc.: Despite speculation that 
sophomore Karsten Whitson might make his return from arm soreness tonight, right-hander Greg Larson will get the start for Florida. The righty hasn’t pitched since throwing less than an inning Feb. 26 against 
William & Mary.TUESDAY, MARCH 27, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 15
BASEBALL , from page 13Whitson (arm) remains outThompson’s absence has left a sizable void in 
the middle of the Gators’ defense — one that is 
proving very difficult for coach Kevin O’Sullivan to fill.
Initial plans were for senior Daniel Pigott, nor -
mally Florida’s everyday left fielder, to shift to cen-ter while freshman Justin Shafer took over in left. 
O’Sullivan sounded confident in Shafer’s ability 
to step up in Thompson’s absence, but the fresh-man dropped a routine fly ball in the seventh in-ning last Tuesday against Samford. The drop al-lowed Samford batter Zeth Stone to reach second base and score on the following at-bat, cutting the Gators’ lead to 4-3.
That same game, Shafer didn’t charge the ball 
hard on a shallow base hit to left field, nor did he attempt to make a throw home as the Bulldogs took an early 1-0 lead in the first. In the sixth, Pig-ott misjudged a fly ball to center that went over his head for a triple. 
While those errors did not cost Florida the game, 
they highlighted a series of misadventures in the outfield for the Gators’ new platoon of fielders.
“Just because someone makes one mistake, I’m 
not going to push the panic button,” O’Sullivan said after the game.
Florida’s skipper stuck with Shafer in left and 
Pigott in center heading into the South Carolina series, but that one mistake was quickly followed by another. Shafer dropped a routine fly ball in the third inning of the series opener and was subse-quently benched. The move brought Pigott back to left field and put Cody Dent in center field for the first time in his career, a move O’Sullivan made to “shore up the defense.”
Dent started Friday’s game, but moved to third 
when Josh Tobias fractured his hand. That caused O’Sullivan to put Pigott back in center field and move Vickash Ramjit from the bench to left field — a position he only played occasionally during summer ball.
Ramjit was sound defensively in left field and 
made a spectacular catch in foul territory Saturday , reaching over the fence to make the grab among the fans in the stands. But the musical-chairs act 
that put Pigott back in center resulted in a fourth-
inning error that sparked a South Carolina rally.
The Gators overcame the misplayed fly ball, 
again, and none of the outfield mistakes have prov-en costly . But three outfield errors in the team’s last four games without its everyday center fielder, who committed just 1 in 154 games, is cause for se-rious concern for the nation’s second-best fielding team (.982 fielding percentage).
There’s a tradition at The Mac, one that has been 
ongoing for four years now. Students in the left-field bleachers stand and flap their arms like wings when Thompson is at the plate — a nod to the 1994 Disney film “Angels in the Outfield.” 
But with Thompson’s college career likely over, 
there is no more wing-flapping. 
The angels are no longer in the outfield, but the 
Gators could use some now more than ever, be-
cause the loss of Thompson is proving to be bigger 
than anyone expected.

After struggling with its first two 
events Saturday at the Southeastern 
Conference Championships, No. 1 Florida trailed No. 6 Georgia by a margin of .125 points.
Then, vault started. The Gators pieced together a 
49.525 — their second-highest vault total this season — to launch to the top of the SEC leaderboard by a .325-point margin over the seven-team field. 
From that point on, UF never re-
linquished its advantage.  
“Vault was definitely a turn-
ing point for us,” coach Rhonda Faehn said. “We just had the best vault performance of the season. It turned everything around. It was just really, really incredible.”
Before Saturday’s competition, 
sticking landings on vault was an area in which the Gators needed a vast improvement. 
Prior to March 24, UF was sev-
enth in the country on vault and 
averaged a 49.283. On the road, that 
average was slightly lower at 49.27.
Against Utah a week prior to 
SECs, Florida failed to stick a single landing. While the team still man-aged to score a 49.325 total, its fourth-best of the year, the perfor -
mance was not its sharpest.
“We worked really hard dur -
ing [last] week on vault and did stick drills,” Faehn said. “We really made it a priority.”Following shaky showings on 
balance beam (49.05) and floor ex-ercise (49.2), the Gators knew that nailing vault was do or die. 
Despite an early 9.775 from se-
nior Nicole Ellis, freshman Rachel Spicer and UF’s four all-arounders refused to get rattled. Spicer posted a 9.825, and junior Ashanée Dicker -
son and sophomore Alaina Johnson followed through with scores of 9.9. 
Junior Marissa King, who had 
stumbled all year on vault, then recorded a season-best 9.925. But freshman Kytra Hunter made the biggest impact, notching a meet-high vault score of 9.975 to close out the rotation on a fierce note. 
“It really re-energized every-
one,” Faehn said. “It was really hard to get that momentum because we had a bye after every single event. It’s kind of hard to keep it going be-
cause you have to go back into the 
locker room.”
In its final event, uneven bars, 
Florida tallied a 49.375 to seal its eighth conference championship in school history. But it was UF’s per -
formance on vault that proved to be the key. 
“[The vault performance] was 
a great push,” Faehn said. “It was great for them to see you don’t have to be perfect to win, but it’s a matter of how you respond to the situation and how much you just keep fight-ing.”
UF headed to Raleigh for re-
gionals: The Gators found out Monday that their next pit stop will be Raleigh, N.C.
Top-ranked Florida will return 
to Reynolds Coliseum to compete 
as the top seed for the NCAA Re-
gional on April 7 at 4 p.m. UF’s competition will be No. 12 Ohio State, No. 13 Penn State, regional-host No. 20 North Carolina State, Kent State and North Carolina.
The last time the Gators com-
peted at Reynolds Coliseum was in their season opener against the 
Wolfpack on Jan. 6. UF dominated 
that dual meet to win 196.025-194.675.

The Gators will have a different look 
when the 2012-13 season begins.
Florida has five seniors leaving the team 
along with sophomore guard Brittany Shine, 
who announced her decision to transfer via 
Twitter on Monday.
While the prospect of returning only four 
players who suited up for UF’s final game 
seems daunting, Florida faced a similar sce-nario in 2010-11.
In coach Amanda Butler’s fourth year, six 
Gators made their Division-I debut in the sea-son opener. Barring redshirts, UF will have six players joining the team next season.
However, the inexperience does not con-
cern Butler as much as it did two years ago.
“I don’t think that we’ve been in a situ-
ation where we were returning a first-team All-SEC player, and we have that in Jennifer (George),” Butler said.
George was a key cog in Florida’s NCAA 
Tournament run this season, emerging as a playmaker in the frontcourt for the Gators.
The junior forward set career-high marks 
with 12.8 points and 8.8 rebounds per game, leading UF in both categories. The best sta-
tistical stretch for George this season was a 
streak of double-doubles, which lasted eight games from Dec. 7 to Jan. 8.
“She’s going to be the best player on the 
team,” redshirt senior guard Jordan Jones said. “She has to take that on her shoulders and know that the gameplan is going to be for her to score, but the opponents’ game-plan is going to be to stop her.”
George is a soft-spoken player who said 
she relied on senior center Azania Stewart to be the vocal leader in the frontcourt.
However, George acknowledged that she 
needs to become a team leader, something she said she hasn’t had to do since her senior year of high school.
“I have to be prepared, mentally and 
physically, to take on a new role,” George said. “I’ll be ready for it.”
George will have some help guiding 
the Gators’ young roster next season from sophomore guard Jaterra Bonds. Bonds, who ranked second to Jones with 967 minutes played this season, was the only UF player to start all 33 games of the 2011-12 campaign.
“The experience that Jaterra’s had the 
past two years will really 
help us,” Butler said.
The Gators’ berth in the 
NCAA Tournament this season was the their first since 2008-09. Despite los-ing six players, George be-lieves Florida will improve on this year’s second-round 
exit in 2012-13.
“We’ve been to a tournament now, and 
we expect to go again,” George said. 
“I feel like it’s all about the atmosphere 
around here that we expect greatness from 
all players, even if they’re going to be fresh-men.”
Shine to transfer: Shine announced via 
her Twitter account that she does not intend to return to Florida for her junior season. 
A UF spokesperson confirmed Shine is 
leaving the program.
“Thank you gator nation The love and 
support u showed me was amazing.. every1 knows I love this game.and I have 2 do wats [sic] best 4 my future,” Shine said in a tweet  on Monday.
One minute later, she added, “I miss the 
feeling of being able 2 look up in the stands and see my family, and I want to play closer to home ...”
Shine, the No. 89 prospect in the ESPNU 
HoopGurlz 100 coming out of high school, was one of six prospects to commit in 2010.  She is the second player from that recruiting class to transfer after Deaundra Young de-
cided to leave UF on Oct. 6, ultimately choos-
ing to go to UCF.
The departures of Shine and Young, cou-
pled with Deana Allen and Lanita Bartley graduating, leave Bonds and Kayla Lewis as the only remaining members of ESPN.com’s 21st-ranked recruiting class in 2010.
