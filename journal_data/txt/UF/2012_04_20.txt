About 200 tires will roll down 
Stadium Road on Monday in honor 
of Michael R. Edmonds Jr.
Team Florida Cycling, a student-
run sports club at UF, will host an hour-long bike ride leading up to a 7 p.m. memorial service for Ed-monds.
The 26-year-old journalism stu-
dent died Sunday after falling from the upper levels of Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium.
The memorial ride is open to the 
public. Participants will leave from Turlington Plaza at 5:45 p.m.
Richard Buning, mountain vice 
president of Team Florida Cycling, said he expects more than 100 people to bike along the Lakeshore Route, which includes Stadium Road, Southeast Hawthorne Road, Lake Shore Drive and East Univer-
sity Avenue. The route is about 12 to 15 miles, he said.
Lt. William 
Gainey of the UPD special ser-vices division said police are determining the 
amount of assistance needed.
A memorial service will follow at 
the Reitz Union Amphitheater.
Walker Ziewitz, road vice presi-
dent of Team Florida Cycling, said UF President Bernie Machen will speak at the service.
Buning said the event is not 
about closure or mourning.
“It’s just a time for us all to come 
together and celebrate the person that he was,” he said. “Do it big, and do it right.”

Ofﬁ  cials set a trap Thursday to catch a 
monkey suspected of stealing fruit from an 
elderly woman in northeast Gainesville.
Schoolchildren and teachers at Charles W. 
Duval Elementary School spotted the patas monkey Tuesday, and neighbors called in sightings of the ﬂ  eeing primate.
Neighbors saw the monkey take kum-
quats and tangerines from a tree in the elderly woman’s yard, said Karen Parker, spokes-woman for Florida Fish and Wildlife Conser-vation Commission.
Gainesville police set up a perimeter for the animal Thursday afternoon, and conser-vation ofﬁ  cers set up a cage trap, Parker said.
She said ofﬁ  cials do not know where the 
monkey came from, noting it was possibly an “escapee” from a Gainesville facility.
The monkey is “not showing any type of 
aggression tendencies,” she said. “But we still don’t want him running around.”
The main concern is for the animal’s safe-
ty, she said, but she added that monkeys can bite.Police set trap for unclaimed monkey

 Former Florida guard Erving 
Walker is ﬁ  nally paying someone 
for the $3 sausage taco he failed to purchase late last month — just not the two downtown ven-dors he stole from.
  At his arraignment Thursday 
morning, Walker pleaded no con-test to a charge of misdemeanor petit theft and will have to pay $301 in ﬁ  nes and court costs to the State of Florida. Walker, 22, can clear the case from his record if he pays the full amount by Sept. 27.
  The state 
attorney also dropped the one misde-meanor count of resisting an ofﬁ  cer without 
violence Walk-er was charged 
with.  On March 30 at 1 a.m., the 5-foot-8, 177-pound point guard was arrested for stealing a taco from the Tacos Locos food stand in downtown Gainesville and running away from police.

cos Locos, James Perez and Matt Hruska, said they received paper-work in the mail about Walker’s court date and how they could

The Gainesville City Commis-
sion approved a possible new 
design for the Gainesville Police Department Headquarters and Physical Training Facility during a meeting Thursday.
Joe Frisco, project executive 
for Mills Gilbane, and Jack Wil-liams, design project manager for Harvard Jolly, presented three options to the City Commission for consideration.
One model featured a contem-
porary design, which showcased a modern building with an open entrance and large windows. The other model employed a more traditional design with a red brick building.
City spokesman Bob Woods 
said the commission rejected both options.
Frisco and Williams then pre-
sented the commission with a third design.
Woods said the commission 
realized the alternative option was the most appealing because it captured elements of both the contemporary and traditional buildings.
Commissioner Susan Bottcher 
said GPD employee input would be invaluable in the commis-sion’s choosing a final design.“It wouldn’t be just a new 
building but a point of pride for them as well,” she said.
GPD Chief Tony Jones agreed 
to gather opinions on the models from law enforcement officials and to report back to the com-mission in a future meeting.
Although the commission 
voted on a possible design, it is not finalized, Woods said.
“The design team will come 
back with a revised design,” he said.4, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, APRIL 20, 2012

UF’s Office of Academic Sup-
port wants to help students feel 
more prepared about the process of considering and applying for graduate school.
OAS will host “Graduate 
School Mini Conference: Every-thing You Want to Know” from 9:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday in Ustler Hall.
The conference is free for all 
students, but space is limited to 75 spots.
“We decided to start prepar -
ing students for life after gradu-ating with an undergraduate de-gree,” said Joe Johnson, assistant director of OAS. “We thought this would be a good way to develop the peer mentors in our office and students at UF.”
The conference will consist 
of two hours of breakout ses-sions that include presentations about choosing the right gradu-ate school, the politics of gradu-ate school, tokenism in graduate school programs and basic knowl-edge about graduate school.
The conference will provide 
lunch and a panel discussion with  graduate students and faculty.
Johnson said about 50 spots 
are still available.
“The program is free and lunch 
is free,” Johnson said. “The only thing that students have to spend is time.”
For more information or to 
RSVP , contact Joe Johnson at 352-392-0786 or at j6johnson8@ufl.Academic

Officials are unsure where the monkey belongs
Patas monkeys are nonaggressive primates 
known to be able to run 30 mph, earning them 
the nickname the “greyhounds of the monkey world,” Parker said.
While officials are not sure where the mon-
key came from, Santa Fe College Teaching Zoo Director Jonathan Miot said the primate is not from the zoo.
“It is not ours,” he said. “We don’t have pa-
tas monkeys.”He said the zoo counts every animal three 
times a day to check for escapes.
Conservation officials filled the 6-by-3-foot 
cage with bananas, pineapples, watermelons and blueberries and are waiting for the mon-key to take the bait, Parker said.
She said the trap contains a trash can with 
the fruit inside. 
If the monkey disturbs the can, it will trig-
ger the trap, and the cage will close.
Once caught, the monkey will be taken to a 
secure location where it will be cared for. Parker said she was not sure which 
Gainesville facility was preparing to take the monkey.
“We’re hoping our fruit will be more tempt-
ing than the fruit in the trees,” she said. 
In 2010, a rhesus macaque scampered 
across various Tampa neighborhoods and eluded capture for years, earning the nick-name “Mystery Monkey,” according to the Tampa Bay Times. It is currently at large.

Tacos Locos owners will not recover stolen taco cost
get compensated for their taco, 
they tried to keep the national story in perspective.
“I could seek restitution, but I 
would have to go fill out paper -
work for like $3,” Perez said.Before police were able to ap-
prehend Walker in the 200-block of West University Avenue, Perez chased the Division-I ath-lete across three blocks but could only watch as Walker eventu-ally tripped over his own feet in a nearby parking lot and dropped the uneaten taco on the asphalt.  The theft occurred less than a 
week after Florida’s Elite Eight loss to Louisville in the NCAA Tournament. Walker, a three-year starter at point guard and lone se-nior on this year’s team, ended his career as the Gators’ all-time lead-er in assists and minutes played.
Though Walker reportedly apologized for his actions as he was leaving his arraignment, Per -
ez said he and Hruska don’t need to hear one from the former col-lege star.
“If we could get those $3,” Per -
ez said, “that would be dope.”

For one couple, it felt as if mountains 
trembled and rainbows exploded. The sex 
was simply “ah-maz-ing.”
Young people in Gainesville are using 
a new website to publicize and rate their intimate encounters. Wheredidyouwearit.com, a Planned Parenthood project that promotes safe sex, lets them plot their esca-pades on a national map along with details about age, gender and relationship status.
“Twenty-somethings love social media, 
and we like to hear about each other’s sex lives,” said 21-year-old public relations se-nior Cayla Williams. “This website lever -
ages that to promote safe sex.”
Planned Parenthood created the map 
in February to spread the message that condom use is normal and enjoyable. First pitched to college students in the Seattle area, it spread to Gainesville earlier this month. About a dozen dots on the map are now centered on UF.
Though condom use in Florida is 
slightly higher than the national average, roughly three out of 10 Florida teens didn’t wear a condom the last time they had sex, according to the Centers for Disease Con-trol and Prevention.
Williams plans to boost awareness of 
the campaign on campus by distributing condoms labeled with QR codes, which al-low students to “check in” to Planned Par -
enthood’s map using their smartphones.
The site doesn’t display exact addresses 
for the sake of “keeping your secret spot a secret,” but it pinpoints a nearby location.
Michael Fyalka, a 24-year-old adver -
tising junior, discovered the website this week and said he’ll use it.
“I can imagine a lot of men would use 
this for bragging rights,” he said.
The creators of Where Did You Wear 
It initially worried users would abuse the site by posting vulgar content, said Kristen Glundberg-Prossor, a Planned Parenthood spokeswoman.
To sidestep the problem, they designed 
drop-down menus featuring colorful phrases for describing sex. For instance, those who have bad experiences can choose the option, “It could only get better… ”
Nevertheless, some Gainesville groups 
find the campaign offensive.
Father Roland Julien, of St. Patrick Cath-
olic Church, said the map’s only benefit would be helping abstinent students avoid areas full of sexual promiscuity . Otherwise, he said, it’s simply visualizing a vice, like mapping out drug or alcohol abuse.
Glundberg-Prossor declined to com-
ment on specific criticisms of the cam-paign. Instead, she emphasized that the overall response among college students has been positive.
“We need to tell our friends about this,” 
Williams said. “It’s time for them to wrap it up.”FRIDAY, APRIL 20, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 5

In a warehouse lined with metal 
storage shelves sit 500-pound card-
board boxes filled with disassem-bled computer equipment. Five-foot towers of microwaves and a sea of desktop computers lie on the floor next to a group of outdated stereo systems.
The Arc of Alachua County is 
a national nonprofit organization that provides job training and em-ployment to the developmentally disabled. It employs about 120 resi-dents in occupational areas like packaging, recycling, janitorial and lawn services.
Every day at The Arc, about 
25 developmentally disabled Gainesville residents dismantle col-lected E-waste from across the city . The parts are then sold to businesses where they are recycled into new products.
The city decided earlier this 
month to start an E-waste collection program with The Arc and its envi-ronmentally friendly services. Once a week, the organization will collect unwanted or broken electronics that residents leave outside their homes and dissect them at its warehouse.
After employees dissect the ma-
chines, the pieces are sold to various companies that melt the mostly met-al products and reuse the material, said Todd Baker, assistant director for adult nonresidential programs at The Arc.
For the past 10 years, Baker has 
overseen the organization’s employ-ment services. He had the idea to start the E-waste program two years ago.“I’m always thinking of ways 
that we can employ more people,” Baker said. “This was a way to keep waste out of the landfills and cre-ate more jobs for people who really needed them.”
The Arc has been collecting E-
waste from houses around the city for the last year as a trial to make sure the program ran smoothly.
In that time, it has collected about 
12,000 pounds of E-waste from residents, which would have been thrown into the city’s landfill, said Steve Joplin, manager of the city’s solid waste division.The city decided to partner with 
the organization because it wanted an inexpensive way to provide a convenient, ecological alternative to throwing away old electronics.
Each month, the city pays The 
Arc about $300 for its E-waste ser -
vice, Joplin said.
“We are always looking for out-
of-the-box ways to solve problems,” Joplin said. “For some people, the big deal with this program may not be that we are recycling. It may be that somebody now has a job.”
The E-waste program employs 
about 30 residents with disabilities ranging from developmental to physical disabilities.
The money given to the organi-
zation for its collection services and products is used to pay its employ-ees, Baker said.
Most people who come to The Arc seeking work have never had jobs before, said Executive Director Dick Bradley.
Working at The Arc teaches them 
workplace skills set that some peo-ple take for granted, such as getting to work on time, learning how to use tools and communicating with boss-es and co-workers, Bradley said.
Eventually , the staff at The Arc 
helps place its employees in jobs within the community.
“The ultimate goal is to create 
jobs that help them develop a skill that is marketable outside of the confines of The Arc,” Bradley said. “The recycling industry continues to grow, so hopefully there will be more and more job opportunities for those working in our E-waste pro-gram.”

While this is the last Friday of publication for the semester,

So, sit back, relax and enjoy this week’s where-the-hell-did-

Darts & Laurels
What the hell is wrong with some people?For allegedly attempting to meet with a 14-year-old girl for 
sex and then arguing that he thought he was trying to meet up with a 17-year-old, we throw a what-makes-that-any-less-creepy DART to Andrew Noell, a 25-year-old music teacher 
from Ocala.
Gross.Speaking of monkeys, residents of Gainesville have been 
on the lookout for one that the Florida Fish and Wildlife Con-servation has been trying to catch. For that, we give a they-will-never-take-away-my-freedom LAUREL to the Patas 
monkey.
You go, monkey!While we’re on things that are exotic, there has been a big 
to-do about a scandal involving U.S. Secret Service agents and prostitutes in Colombia. We don’t really care about this issue too much, but we are going to throw a dude-you-need-to-pay-for-your-services DART at the Secret Service agent who did 
not pay his escort.
Thanks for making us look cheap!Speaking of not paying for things, we throw a how-does-
that-300-dollar-taco-taste DART at UF basketball player Erv-
ing Walker, who was arrested for stealing a $3 taco from a food stand. That taco is now costing him a $300 fine.
Mmm, mmm, mmm … justice.We have to give a getting-involved-and-making-your-voic-
es-heard LAUREL to the students and faculty who protested 
cuts to the Computer and Information Science and Engineer -
ing Department this week.
Five students were able to meet with College of Engineer -
ing Dean Abernathy and extended the deadline for budget proposals to May 7.
Good job!Finally, on a more serious note, we give a double-wham-

REL to Dick Clark and Levon Helm, who passed away this 
week.
At age 82, Clark passed away from a heart attack in Santa 
Monica, Calif. Clark was known for hosting “Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve” and the classic “American Bandstand.”
Helm, who passed away at the age of 71 after complica-

might. Our generation has been defined by Iraq and Af-ghanistan, our parents’ by Vietnam and our grandparents’ by World War II.
It is imperative that the United States takes a hard look at 
its use of the military . Advocates of any military action ought to stand up and explain why we must kill other people and why it’s necessary for more mothers to stand weeping at their sons’ caskets. Advocates should justify why we must deprive people of their lives, the only thing we have and will ever know in the world, through the human cost of war.
Once you realize the family-destroying consequences 
of war, you begin to question the motives of war: to project power, to gain an economic benefit, to crush a rising nation or to mold the world in a way that better suits America. All seem like unwise justifications to sentence people to death.
Until 1947, the U.S. had a Department of War. The name 
change to the Department of Defense was done to blunt per -
ceptions of the department’s aggression, but since the renam-ing, the “Defense Department” has been even more active. Ever wonder why we don’t have a Department of Peace?
The problem is precisely what President Eisenhower 
warned against in his Farewell Address: the military-indus-trial complex, a “buddy-buddy” relationship between the war-making industry and those in government.
Because the military industry is private, it has a profit mo-
tive. If there is less war, the government will purchase fewer tanks and bombs, translating into less money for the war-profiting industry . Therefore, it’s in the best interest of this industry for America to be at war.
How does the military industry encourage war? Simple 
answer: by influencing government to wage war more fre-quently. Campaign contributions help prod politicians into larger military budgets and more foreign adventures. Politi-cians will claim America absolutely needs the newest fighter jet to maintain our military edge, and that it will support American jobs (in their district or state). As recent history has shown, when we have a standing fighting force with the shiniest new toys, we just can’t help but use them. In the end, the military industry goes laughing to the bank while more bombs whistle through the air.
To dismantle the military-industrial complex, the U.S. 
should nationalize the military industry and reduce (if not abolish) its standing army.
Although I’m in the “government is not the solution, it 
is the problem” camp, nationalization of the war-making industry will set the military-industrial complex ablaze, re-moving the profit motive, thus preventing casual warfare. Nationalization of the military industry won’t necessarily hinder innovation; through agencies like NASA, the govern-ment has proven its innovation capabilities.
The U.S. maintaining a standing army is unique to the 
20th century, especially after World War II, when the U.S. thought it couldn’t demilitarize because of the Soviet Union. If we reduced our standing army, not only would aggression and warfare decrease, but the economy would get a boost because, as it stands now, the U.S. dedicates almost 5 percent of its gross domestic product to “defense.”
Some will claim that nationalizing the military industry 
and reducing our standing army will put America and the world in danger. Truthfully , however, other countries — namely North Korea, China and Iran — beef up their mili-taries precisely to defend against us. Instead, the U.S. can be a nation of peace and prosperity , not a nation of bloodshed and violence; however, it will take the demolition of the mil-itary-industrial complex.

Letter to the Editor
Department cuts could lead to 
university independence
It is obvious we are beginning a volatile 
year for UF. The issue at hand is the Depart-
ment of Computer and Information Science and Engineering dean’s proposal to drasti-cally cut and reform CISE to address budget cuts. But we shouldn’t kid ourselves that similar proposals from other deans aren’t coming.
The budget cuts are serious, and deans 
are limited in the responses they can make. Most can’t simply ask each department to take a small cut. Due to previous cuts, op-erating margins are razor-thin, and even a 2-percent cut would require cutting gradu-ate student support or employees.
Moreover, due to union agreements, any 
employee fired would have to be nontenured or a lecturer. Yet the latter (along with grad students) do the most teaching and cost the least. Under the Responsibility Center Man-agement budget allocation model, the result would be a net loss of funds for the college since it would mean fewer classes.
It is likely that most deans are going to 
see cutting out whole departments as the only option.
Why are we in this situation? Is it just 
the bad economy? Partially, but the reality is that the state legislature continues to fa-vor making cuts to university funding. And though UF has raised tuition 60 percent dur-ing the past four years, the cuts have always exceeded the increase.
This is a national trend: State govern-
ments all over are deciding that public high-er education isn’t a priority. The economy is bad, health care costs are rising, and they can’t pay for it all. Something has to give, and that something is higher education.
Why higher ed? A cynical person might 
suggest it’s because students don’t vote, though there are other reasons, too. Impor-tantly, this has only a loose connection to the economy’s health. This trend was there be-fore the economic downturn. The downturn just hastened it.
As this occurs, public universities have 
responded in the only way possible: cutting costs and raising tuition. At UF, there are 20 percent fewer professors in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences than five years ago. Tuition has skyrocketed, doubling at public universities since 1994. Student loans have followed, topping $1 trillion recently. And tuition is going to get much higher here at UF.
Right now, the governor is considering 
signing a bill to allow UF to become much more independent and raise tuition rapidly to the national average. Most faculty want him to sign it. It’s the only way we survive as a top research and teaching university.
Nobody likes this. But state governments 
are no longer interested in funding public higher education. Ohio State gets less than 10 percent of its funds from state alloca-tions. Its tuition is nearly twice that of UF’s. To survive, research universities have to be-come more independent. Student tuition has to skyrocket. The phrase “public university” will be used more sarcastically.
It’s the new reality. Welcome to it.

No one disputes that we live in the Information Age. 
How then can the College of Engineering justify taking aim at the specialty that spawned the age we live in?
We take for granted the underlying data structures, the pro-
tocol standards born out of the minds of computer scientists and the open Web. Software powers everything from farming to Farmville. Databases are everywhere.
From the largest data consumers such as the federal gov-
ernment, Google, AT&T, IBM and the rest of the Fortune 500 companies to the mom-and-pop companies using QuickBooks, databases are everywhere.
Supply chains are increasingly automated and made to be 
more efficient. Smart power and green technology depend on intelligent machinery made possible only through applied computer science.
Driverless cars are on the horizon, which will save tens of 
thousands from needless deaths and millions more from acci-dents, thanks to software. Algorithms, the great sledgehammer of computer science, have tackled immense problems from space travel to nuclear power to weather prediction.
The impact of basic research and education in the field of 
computer science has been so phenomenal, so significant that no science nor art has remained un-touched by computing. 
Bill Gates said that software is the 
soul of the machine, and he’s right. Just as your soul is a separately distinct 
entity from your biology, it is an emergent property of your biology, but it remains an important entity in and of itself.
It is worthy to note that the College of Medicine has an en-
tire department dedicated to neuroscience. This is a praisewor -
thy thing. Neuroscience is sufficiently complex and nuanced to justify its own department separate from other distinct areas of medicine or biology.
Computer science is analogous to neuroscience or psychol-
ogy. It is a specialty of its own, completely separate from bi-ology. It is so complex that there are many sub-specialties of computing that grow increasingly relevant in this digital age.
In fact, Georgia Tech, a Top 10 engineering school, just re-
cently made the move to create a separate College of Comput-ing because of this increased importance.
The move to integrate computer science and electrical engi-
neering is a move to generalize our education rather than spe-cialize it. Expert knowledge is the single difference separating us from antiquity. It’s not so much that we are orders of mag-nitude smarter than our ancestors; we are just more focused on learning more and more about specific domains.
The proposal by Dean Abernathy and the College of Engi-
neering to diminish the research activity in computer science is devastating to all areas of this college. I just listed myriad industries, arts and sciences that are positively affected by re-search and breakthroughs in computer science.
There is an unseen ripple effect in the damaging nature of 
this, and every student should be furious. I don’t know who to blame — the dean, the UF president, the governor of Florida or the people of Florida. All I know is that whatever system we have for determining our priorities as a society are broken within this state.
The modern world is here to stay . Florida can either be a 
part of it or be left in its wake. I call on all residents of Florida  to stand up and support the mission of our universities.
We need to turn this attitude around. We need to be for -
ward-thinking and positive about progress once again in this state.
We need to SAVE CISE!Chris Cordle is a software engineering junior at UF.

Five-time Grammy Award-winning 
artist Buddy Guy will play the blues at 
7:30 p.m. Saturday at the Phillips Cen-ter for the Performing Arts.
Tickets for the public range from 
$30 to $50, depending on the location of the seats. Student tickets are $15.
About 500 tickets remain, according 
to the Phillips Center Box Office.
Tickets can be purchased at the box 
office, through Ticketmaster or by vis-iting the University Box Office at the Reitz Union. Students cannot get their 
discount through Ticketmaster.
Guy performed 
at the Phillips Cen-
ter in 2006. Having him perform again is a part of the Phil-lips Center’s 20th anniversary season, said Todd Taylor, a 
spokesman for UF Performing Arts.
Guy will perform material from his 
latest album, “Living Proof.”
There will be a pre-performance 
discussion with David Edmund, a vis-iting assistant professor in UF’s School of Music, at 6:45 p.m. in the center’s Fackler Foyer West.
Cracker the Box, a blues and folk 
group, will open for Guy. The group will feature 16-year-old Anthony Ka-vouklis.
Kavouklis was invited on stage to 
play guitar with Guy at his 2006 Phil-lips Center performance.
“Buddy Guy is as big as they get in 
the blues genre,” Taylor said. “And by all accounts, he puts on a great show.”Phillips

� MAYOR CRAIG LOWE SAID HE 
DOES NOT SUPPORT LEGISLATIVE CUTS TO HIGHER EDUCATION.

Members of the City Commission are 
hesitant to create a petition against pro-
posed budget cuts to UF’s College of En-gineering Department of Computer and Information Science and Engineering.
A graduate student in the engineering 
college stood in front of the commission Thursday afternoon and asked commis-sioners to draft a petition in opposition to the CISE cuts. 
The City Commission did not comply.“I just don’t see any action we can take 
at this time that would be helpful,” Commis-sioner Jeanna Mastrodi-casa said.
Though he did not 
comment on cuts to CISE, Mayor Craig Lowe said he did not support decisions made by the state legislation 
that cut higher education funding, which he called “short-sighted.”Commissioner Todd Chase said he 
was uncomfortable making judgements on a specific college dean’s decision to deal with budget acts, referring to Col-lege of Engineering Dean Cammy Aber -
nathy, who proposed the CISE cuts.
“These cuts are from the state govern-
ment,” Chase said. “That is who you’d have to have your difference of opinion with.”
Chase and Mastrodicasa said discus-
sion about the subject is good, but they said they do not foresee the commission drafting a petition in the future.

GULF OIL SPILL 
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
NEW ORLEANS — Roughly 
7,300 residents and businesses 
harmed by the 2010 oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico will get more than $64 million in additional payments because their claims with BP’s $20 billion compensation fund were shortchanged or wrongfully de-nied, the Justice Department an-nounced Thursday.
An independent audit of the 
Gulf Coast Claims Facility found “significant errors” in its process-ing of claims that led to applicants receiving less than what they were entitled to under GCCF pro-cedures, the federal agency said.
Claimants eligible for the ad-
ditional payments should be re-ceiving them in the next week to 10 days, a Justice Department spokesman said.
The auditor also identified 
claimants who were erroneously overpaid, but the department says the GCCF isn’t trying to recover those overpayments.
Fund administrator Ken Fein-
berg said Thursday that the $64 million amount was modest for a program that paid out more than $6 billion in 18 months. 
He had absorbed much of the 
blame for what some affected in-dividuals and businesses said was a slow payment process.
Although the audit identified 
errors, it found that the GCCF claims process “constituted a sig-nificant advance” in disaster re-sponse.
“While our independent evalu-
ation did uncover instances in which errors were made in the claims evaluation process, in gen-eral, the GCCF appeared to have consistently applied its protocols and methodologies in processing claims,” the auditor’s report said.
More than 2,600 others whose 
claims were erroneously denied won’t be getting checks because their claims files did not contain information needed to determine whether they sustained a financial loss, according to the auditor’s re-port.
BP spokesman Scott Dean said 
the audit shows the GCCF “de-livered significant achievements” during its 18-month tenure.
BP created its compensation 
fund after the April 20, 2010 blow-out of its Macondo well triggered a deadly explosion on the Deep-water Horizon rig and spawned the nation’s worst offshore oil spill.
The GCCF processed more 
than 1 million claims and paid out more than $6 billion from the fund to more than 220,000 busi-nesses and individuals, including commercial fishermen, property owners, hotels and other tourism-driven businesses that blamed the spill for economic damages.
After BP and a team of plain-
tiffs’ attorneys agreed to a class-action settlement of economic damage claims last month, a court-supervised administrator took over the claims process from the GCCF on March 8.
Attorney General Eric Holder 
directed an independent auditor to evaluate the GCCF after he vis-ited the Gulf Coast last summer.
According to the Justice De-
partment, BDO Consulting is pre-paring a full report that will be published later this spring.

� HE PLAYED DRUMS AND SANG 
FOR THE BAND.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
ALBANY, N.Y. — With songs like “The 
Night They Drove Old Dixie Down,” ‘’The 
Weight” and “Up on Cripple Creek,” The Band fused rock, blues, folk and gospel to create a sound that seemed as authentically American as a Mathew Brady photograph or a Mark Twain short story.
In truth, the group had only one Ameri-
can — Levon Helm.
Helm, the drummer and singer who 
brought an urgent beat and a genuine Ar-kansas twang to some of The Band’s best-known songs and helped turn a bunch of musicians known mostly as Bob Dylan’s backup group into one of rock’s most leg-endary acts, has died. He was 71.
Helm, who was found to have throat can-
cer in 1998, died Thursday afternoon of com-plications from cancer at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City, said Lucy Sabini of Vanguard Records. 
On Tuesday, a message on his website 
said he was in the final stages of cancer.
Helm and his bandmates — Canadians 
Rick Danko, Garth Hudson, Robbie Rob-ertson and Richard Manuel — were musi-cal virtuosos who returned to the roots of American music in the late 1960s as other rockers veered into psychedelia, heavy met-al and jams. The group’s 1968 debut, “Music From the 
Big Pink,” and its follow-up, “The Band,” remain landmark albums of the era, and songs such as “The Weight,” ‘’Dixie Down” and “Cripple Creek” have become rock stan-dards.
Early on, The Band backed Dylan on his 
sensational and controversial electric tours of 1965-66 and collaborated with him on the legendary “Basement Tapes,” which pro-duced “I Shall Be Released,” ‘’Tears of Rage” and many other favorites.
“I am terribly sad. Thank you for 50 years 
of friendship and music,” Hudson posted on his website Thursday evening. “No more sorrows, no more troubles, no more pain. He went peacefully to that beautiful marvel-ous wonderful place. ... Levon, I’m proud of you.”
The son of an Arkansas cotton farmer, 
Helm was just out of high school when he joined rocker Ronnie Hawkins for a tour of Canada in 1957 as the drummer for the Hawks. 
That band eventually recruited a group of 
Canadian musicians who, along with Helm, spent grueling years touring rough bars in Canada and the South.
They would split from Hawkins, hook up 
with Dylan and eventually call themselves The Band — because, as they explained many times, that’s what everyone called them anyway.
Original members of The Band were in-
ducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994.FRIDAY, APRIL 20, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 9

The City Commission unanimously 
approved the design of a new RTS Bus 
Fleet Maintenance and Operations Fa-cility on Thursday , which will allow for more buses to operate throughout the city.
It will be built next to the current RTS 
building at the intersection of Southeast First Street and Veitch Street.
The current facility does not ad-
equately service the growing number of RTS buses in Gainesville, said city spokesman Bob Woods.
The approved design includes an op-
erations and administration building, a maintenance building, a bus wash center and a parking area for 200 buses, among other features. The operations and ad-ministration building was designed to meet LEED Silver requirements.
The city hopes to have the first phase 
of construction done by 2014. Funding for the project came from grants from the Florida Department of Transportation.
Commissioner Jeanna Mastrodicasa 
said she was con-cerned the project may cause noise complaints from surrounding neighborhoods.
The design team 
held two workshops earlier this year where residents shared input about the project. The 
team said it is working to ensure noise will not be a problem.

The UF Supreme Court ruled Thursday 
night that campaign-like activity is allowed 
throughout the year.
Sen. David Bradshaw petitioned the court 
to clarify the meaning of the election code that states “campaigning begins on the first day of the active election cycle.”
Bradshaw said the code was vague and 
could be left to numerous interpretations. He said it could be interpreted as fact and therefore be irrelevant in the codes. It could mean that restrictions only apply to the elec-tion cycle, he said, or it could mean that cam-paigning can only happen during the election cycle.
The court ruled that election codes still ap-
ply to campaign action, and if facts implicate a political party, it will be held responsible even if the party does not exist.
UF political parties are only registered as student organizations for about six weeks each semester. They are unregistered one week after elections, according to the Student Organization Handbook.
Bradshaw said this raised the issue that 
because the party does not exist, it cannot be held responsible if someone associated with the party violated the election codes.
Chief Justice Matt Michel was not aware 
that political parties did not exist outside of the election cycle. But he said that in some fashion, political parties do exist throughout the year.
After the slating process starts, the Elec-
tion Commission could look back at actions that already happened and rule on it, Michel said after the hearing.
Bradshaw said he was pleased with the 
court ruling for now.
“The court found that [legislation] needs 
to be done in the Senate,” he said.

� UF COMPETES TONIGHT AT 
6 IN DULUTH, GA. 
LANDON WATNICK
Alligator Writer
 
At the beginning of one of the 
Gators’ recent practices before 
NCAA Regionals, Alaina Johnson read a quote that resonated deeply with her teammates. 
“Go big or go home,” the sopho-
more all-around competitor said.
The mantra has inspired UF, 
which hasn’t won a national title in the NCAA’s 31 years of women’s gymnastics, to lay it all on the line this postseason. 
“I kind of just said it as a joke, 
but I also do believe that,” Johnson said. “If you give everything you have every day, then you can’t look back.”
When No. 1 seed Florida com-
petes in the evening session of the NCAA Championships in The Are-na at Gwinnett Center in Duluth, Ga., tonight at 6 p.m., its “go big or go home” mentality will be put to the test. 
UF’s semifinal opponents will 
be defending national champion No. 4 Alabama, No. 5 Georgia, No. 8 Arkansas, No. 9 Oregon State and No. 12 Ohio State. This season, Florida holds a 6-1 record against those teams. 
UF defeated each of the three 
Southeastern Conference squads by at least .375 points when it won the SEC Championship in Duluth on March 24. 
“Now we’re going back to a 
site where we were just there [four weeks] ago,” coach Rhonda Faehn said. “It’s very fresh in their mem-ory.”
The Gators know what it feels 
like to leave the NCAA Champion-ships empty-handed. Last year in Cleveland, the team failed to place in the top three in the semifinals by only .075 points and missed the Su-per Six for the first time since 2005. 
In Faehn’s 10 years as Florida’s coach, the Gators have come rela-tively close to winning it all. They finished third in 2007 and either fourth or fifth in five of the last eight years. UF’s best finish ever at NCAAs was second in 1998.
“This year, we don’t have any-
thing to lose,” junior Randy Stage-berg said. “We’re coming off na-tionals where we didn’t make the Super Six but had such a talented team. From the very start of this year, coming in to the gym and working with this team, it’s not even close to what it was before. Everyone is so much more driven and focused. We only compete against ourselves.”
Florida is heading into nation-
als with plenty of momentum. In the regional victory on April 7, the Gators posted the highest score (197.325) of any of the 36 squads competing at the NCAA’s six re-gional sites. 
But only four teams — Georgia, 
Utah, UCLA and Alabama — have won national titles. Florida has always played spectator to other teams’ celebrations, but believes this year it has a good shot at be-coming member No. 5 of the cham-pionship circle. 
“They expect to be able to be 
No. 1 and go in there and perform the way they have all year long,” Faehn said. “That’s something we’ve carried all year long, to com-pete tight and go aggressive no matter what. 
“We don’t want to lose, so it’s a 
matter of leaving it all out there.”

Gators motivated to ‘go big or go home’ at NCAA Championship

Since the start of the season, the Gators 
have had their focus on the postseason. It 
has been a point of emphasis, and every adjustment the team has made throughout the year was done with the postseason in mind.
Now, it has arrived.No. 10 Florida (14-8, 7-4 Southeastern 
Conference) will begin play at the SEC Tournament in Starkville, Miss., today against the winner of Arkansas and Ole Miss at 6 p.m. The competition at the tour -
nament will be fierce, but also far different from any regular-season matches.
“It’s definitely different. I enjoy the SEC 
Tournament and NCAA (Tournament) just because it’s a bonus,” said junior Bob van Overbeek. “It’s nice to have those extra matches and have time off to prepare for them. Hopefully we can do well this week-end and get some momentum going into the NCAA Tournament.”
Although the pressure 
will be on this weekend, van Overbeek said the SEC Tournament serves a function more as a warm-up to the NCAA Tourna-ment. Mainly, he said, this 
will provide an opportu-nity for the Gators to get players performing at a 
high level. It has been a challenge all year for Florida, but a strong finish to the season has the team encouraged that it can make a run.
“We’re not really trying to think of it 
as more important of a match. SEC Tour -
nament is big, but it’s really just another match or two or however many to prepare us for the NCAA Tournament,” he said. “I don’t think the team will be in an extraor -
dinary amount of stress. We’ll just want to be playing well and getting confidence to make a push in NCAAs.”
Junior Trip Carleton agreed, saying that 
the key to postseason success is simply 
Florida men’s and women’s tennis set to begin SEC Tournament
Gators searching for quality play across board

A loss to Florida Inter -
national wouldn’t derail 
Florida from its postseason-bound track. But it would hurt nonetheless. 
This season, the Gators 
have dropped games to in-state rivals South Florida and UCF. And although UF’s record against Florida teams is still a respectable 4-2, los-ing any of its games against FIU starting today at 4 p.m. would be disappointing.
Freshman Lauren Haeger 
knows the sting of losing to an in-state school, having dropped her start against the Bulls on March 28. 
That loss is UF’s only at 
home this season, and she said it would be a big deal to even lose one game to the Panthers.
“We’re supposed to win,” 
Haeger said. “We can’t say, ‘Oh, it’s OK that we lost a game.’ We’re going to take (FIU) seriously just like any-one else. 
“When we do play our 
best, we can beat anyone, so I would be disappointed if we didn’t win. We all expect a lot out of each other and I know coach (Tim Walton) expects a lot out of us, too.”
Haeger said it would be 
easy for her team to over -
look this series against FIU because it has no major im-plications on what’s to come in the Southeastern Confer -
ence Tournament or NCAA Championships. 
But she doesn’t want to let 
that happen.
“We looked over some 
teams this season already, some Florida teams, and we’re definitely not going to let it happen again,” Haeger said. “We’re really going to focus on this weekend. Yeah, we play LSU next week and Alabama and Kentucky in the future, but we are really going to focus on this week-end.”
Historically, the Gators 
have always had a dominat-ing grip on in-state teams. 
Since 1997, Florida has 
chalked up a 128-40 record. 
The last time UF lost at 
least two games to Florida schools was 2006, when it dropped five matchups against Florida State, Stetson and Florida Atlantic. 
But the Gators have never 
been swept in a three-game series against a school from the state of Florida in their 16-year history. 
Junior Kelsey Horton 
would like to keep it that way.
“Our in-state rivals have 
been playing us pretty tough this season,” Horton said. “It wouldn’t be a huge dis-appointment (to lose), but I don’t think anyone wants to lose. So we’re going to play as hard as we can. You don’t want to get nervous; you don’t want to get anxious. Just stay loose and play soft-ball.”
getting everyone to play well at the same 
time. The difference from the regular sea-son, though, is the pressure.
“A lot of people play much differently 
when there’s a lot of pressure,” Carleton said. “That’s where you really see the level. Postseason is the great equalizer.
“We all just have to play as a team. We 
have to come out and play strong in dou-bles. If we have all six guys playing, we’re tough to beat. We just have to all be there, all play well, and just get ready and not give the other team anything.”
Carleton also noted that rankings aren’t 
necessarily the best indicator of a team’s postseason chances. For example, Florida could be ranked higher if not for losing close decisions against Kentucky and Geor -
gia. In the postseason, the Gators know that those losses could easily be turned into wins.
“(The rankings) aren’t arbitrary, but just 
because a team ranked No. 3  is playing a team ranked No. 15 in the tournament, it doesn’t mean the No. 3 is a guaranteed win,” he said. “Tennis, even though it’s a team sport in college, it’s an individual court. Anything is possible in tennis.”
The No. 3 women will be facing Tennes-
see at 7 p.m. in Oxford, Miss. The Gators will be searching for their third consecu-tive SEC tournament championship.18, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, APRIL 20, 2012

Amanda O’Leary was simply 
driving home from work in the summer of 2008 when 
she saw something she had never seen before: girls playing lacrosse in Gainesville.
While she had been hired to start 
the Florida women’s lacrosse pro-gram, the Gators were still two years away from playing their first game, and O’Leary was unaware the sport had a youth presence locally.
By chance, she had stumbled 
upon a summer practice put on by Buchholz coaches Ian and Lynn Millinoff. 
“I had never seen that in this 
area,” O’Leary said. “Of course I got really excited, made a U-turn, parked in the parking lot, came over and introduced myself.”
The couple was just in its second 
year of coaching lacrosse and was still learning on the fly . They were more than happy to oblige when O’Leary asked if she could help out and give the kids some pointers.
“She taught the girls for about 
a half an hour and it was fan-tastic,” Ian said. “They learned more in that half hour than it took us two years to teach them.”  
  
While lacrosse is spreading to 
most high schools in the area, no program has made a deep run in the state playoffs. 
And aside from the fledgling 
program at the private Oak  Hall School, none are grooming a poten-tial Division I prospect like O’Leary’s daughter Madison.
But the girls’ program at Oak 
Hall might not exist yet if it were not for the O’Learys. 
Madison played in a mid-
dle school league started by the Millinoffs, but she wanted to contin-ue playing lacrosse in high school. With limited options in the area, she and her mom approached the Oak Hall administration about forming a program, and the school supported the idea. 
Local coaches agree O’Leary’s 
daughter will be the first Gaines-ville-area player to make it big at the next level, but UF has yet to recruit any player from the area and has just three in-state players on its roster. 
While top-five teams like Syra-
cuse and Maryland benefit from the wealth of talent in their state, only 12 percent of the Gators’ roster is from Florida. Sixty-one percent of the No. 2 Orange’s roster is comprised of players from New York while 62 percent of No. 4 Terrapins’ roster is from in state.
“The University of Florida is the 
flagship university in the state,” O’Leary said. “I think if you can build a roster with Florida players I think that would be something we would look to do. I would be all for it.”
The biggest reason for the dis-
parity of in-state talent between Florida and the northern schools is the amount of opportunities to play  high school and club lacrosse. 
Florida has two high-level club 
programs, while Maryland has more than 20.  At the high school level, Florida has 113 programs, or one per 18,062 girls under the age of 18. Maryland has 196 programs, or one per 3,488 girls under 18.
“It would be a huge help,” O’Leary said of the possibility of be-ing able to recruit the area. “Those opportunities are going to afford themselves to these young women sooner rather than later.” 
Eastside High boys’ coach Chuck 
Rogan and girls’ coach Amber To-massi said for talent in the area to improve a “feeder system” — a club program that has the ability to travel around the country to play top-level competition — needs to be estab-lished.
Rogan said players have not 
been able to improve enough to be recruited by Division I programs such as Florida due to the lack of quality competition.“It’s absolutely exploding and 
going viral,” Rogan said of lacrosse in Gainesville. “The other side of the coin is, there is a ceiling without feeder programs.”

Paul McCord has already in-
stalled the blueprint for how Gainesville lacrosse can raise its ceil-ing.
An assistant women’s coach at 
Jacksonville University and father of Florida freshman attacker Taylor McCord, Paul started growing the sport at the middle and high school levels in the area with the help of his wife Mindy, JU’s head coach.
When interest grew enough at 
the middle school level, the Mc-Cords started Lax Maniax, a girls’ club lacrosse program with teams for middle- and high-school age girls. 
“What that did was it provided 
them with tremendous experience playing against the Long Island teams, the Maryland teams,” Paul said.
He added that Lax Maniax has 
taken more than 50 trips to New York and Maryland with at least 1,000 kids from Florida.  
Taylor played at Bartram Trail 
High in Jacksonville, a program that was also started by her parents. Sev-eral of her teammates also played with her on Lax Maniax. She said that Bartram Trail saw a marked im-provement in its performance once the players got significant experi-ence at the club level.
“If you’re not interested in play-
ing in college, then just play high school,” Taylor said. “But if you are interested in playing in college you definitely have to play on a club team.”
While the addition of a club pro-
gram would help, O’Leary thinks the high schools are close to produc-ing players she can recruit.
“I’ve seen just in the course of 
watching Madison play in that league the improvement has been tremendous,” O’Leary said. “I don’t think we’re real far away.”FRIDAY, APRIL 20, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 19

The Gators want revenge. But it won’t 
come easy.
In its biggest game of the season to date, 
No. 5 Florida (14-2, 4-0 American Lacrosse 
Conference) will look to upset No. 1 North-western (14-0, 4-0) on the road Saturday and take the conference regular-season champi-onship for the second year in a row.
“Last time we played they did beat us, 
so I think there is a little bit of a revenge coming,” junior attacker Kitty Cullen said. “And last time we were there we got killed, so it’s definitely going to be a huge game.”
In 2011, Florida defeated No. 2 North-
western in Gainesville, 13-11, to capture its first ALC regular-season championship. But the eventual-champion Wildcats evened the season series in the finals of the ALC Tour -
nament with a 10-9 win.
Coach Amanda O’Leary said Northwest-
ern has improved since the end of last year, when it defeated Maryland in the national championship.
“Ultimately, we have a little bit more 
confidence going into the game having been successful against them last year,” O’Leary said.  “But they also know [Northwestern] is a totally different team… Their players are a year older, and they didn’t really lose any from last year.”
The Wildcats returned five of their top 
six scorers, including senior attacker and 2011 Tewaaraton Award winner Shannon Smith and 2011 IWLCA Division I Defender of the Year Taylor Thornton.“This is a stacked team,” O’Leary said.Northwestern prefers to play a high-
pressure defense in which it double-teams whoever has the ball at any point on the field. Florida was able to take advantage of the aggressive defense in the teams’ first matchup last season, as Cullen scored six goals while consistently beating the double teams.
However, the Wildcats changed defens-
es in the conference tournament game.
“I was sometimes face guarded, some-
times wasn’t,” Cullen said. “They just kind of packed in a little more instead of running out at us so fast.”
O’Leary said she expects the Wildcats to 
come out aggressively on defense to start, but added that their ability to defend in multiple ways makes them tough to beat.
“She keeps you guessing,” O’Leary said 
of Northwestern coach Kelly Hiller. “She’s a fantastic coach.”
Although junior transfer Gabi Wiegand 
will be playing in her first game against the Wildcats, she is well aware of the magni-tude of Saturday’s showdown.
“I know since Florida beat Northwest-
ern last year it’s going to be a huge game,” Wiegand said. “Both teams look at it as a rivalry.”
While she stressed the importance of UF 
not getting ahead of itself and preparing one game at a time, Wiegand also said she rec-ognized the impact beating Northwestern could have on the Gators going forward.
“It would definitely boost our confi-
dence,” Wiegand said, “and send a mes-sage to all the other teams that we are here to win a national championship.”

Florida knew a rough stretch 
was coming, even before the season 
began.
The Gators are no strangers to 
midseason lulls — they had an 8-8 stretch that spanned from the end of March to the first half of April last season, too — they just had to brace for it and weather the storm again this season.
“We knew at the beginning of the 
year it was going to happen at some point,” senior right fielder Preston Tucker said. “The key was just to get out of it as soon as we could … I think we’re doing a great job of turning it around so far.”
After winning four of its last five 
games to seemingly end the rut, No. 5 Florida (29-8, 9-6 Southeastern Conference) will look to keep the momentum rolling this weekend in a series against Georgia (23-15, 7-8 SEC), starting tonight at 7.
Since a loss to Ole Miss on March 
30 marked the beginning of Florida’s slump, the Gators have employed nine different lineups in 11 games in search of the right recipe to cure their midseason woes.
Turns out the solution to the 
problem rested with juniors Nolan Fontana and Brian Johnson, who have keyed UF’s recent turnaround by getting out of their own slumps at the plate.
After a 5-for-36 funk dropped 
Fontana from the leadoff spot in the Gators’ order following the series opener against Ole Miss, the short-stop has been on a tear. He has hit .450 since and worked 
his way back to the top of the or -
der.
“Instead of the ball looking like 
it does, it looks a little bigger, like a grapefruit,” Fontana said. “I feel like things are going well and we’re starting to click offensively alto-gether.”
That includes Johnson, who is 10 
for 21 (.476) in the last five games after hitting 9 for 45 (.200) in his pre-vious 13 appearances in the batting order.“They’ve done an outstand-
ing job, especially since the lineup hasn’t been swinging it too well as of late,” Tucker said. 
“They’ve really stepped up from 
the bottom third of the lineup and working their way up. They’re do-ing a great job of producing runs, scoring guys when we need them to. That’s a big part of our success right now.”
If the Gators want that success 
to continue through this weekend, they will first have to solve Bulldogs southpaw Alex Wood (5-1, 2.61 ERA) in the series opener. Florida has often times struggled against left-handed pitchers, and Wood provides another stiff challenge. 
In his last three starts, against 
ranked SEC opponents Kentucky, Arkansas and Ole Miss, Wood is 2-0, tossing 22.2 innings and strik-ing out 23 while giving up an aver -
age of three runs per outing.
Florida’s weekend rotation, on 
the other hand, is still looking to re-turn to form. 
The Gators will start righty Jona-
thon Crawford tonight, with John-son taking the mound Saturday and Hudson Randall returning to the mound Sunday for the first time since the Ole Miss series.
“Their starting pitching is really 
good,” Tucker said. “[Wood is] an outstanding prospect, great arm, left-handed pitcher. He’s going to be tough to beat. … Hopefully our starting pitching will do a great job of getting us deep into the game and not giving up a whole lot of runs.”

Five years ago, the women’s track and 
field program’s head coach passed away 
after a long battle with cancer. In his 15 years as head coach at Florida, Tom Jones’ teams won six Southeastern Conference titles in addition to having 15 top-10 fin-ishes at the NCAA Indoor and Outdoor Championships.
This Saturday , Florida will once again 
pay tribute to the late coach in the fifth an-nual Tom Jones Memorial Classic.
“[It’s] another opportunity to compete 
at home in front of our home crowd, but always excited about a chance to honor coach Jones, who meant so much to this program from a lot of standpoints,” coach Mike Holloway said. 
Not only was Jones a mentor to the 
athletes he coached, but he also influenced some of Holloway’s teaching methods.
“He also helped me understand that every athlete is different. You don’t train everybody exactly the same,” Holloway said. “Sometimes we as coaches get caught up in ‘… This is the way I train and either you fit it or you’re out of here.’ I think that in order to be a successful track and field 
coach, you have to un-derstand that each ath-lete has their own dif-ferent quirks.”
When Holloway 
took over the program 
on June 19, 2007, he wanted to find a way to honor Jones for all the things he brought to 
the program and all the athletes he helped during his time with the Gators. On Jan. 26, 2008, Florida hosted its first meet in memory of Jones. 
“I don’t want anybody to forget what 
he did here,” Holloway said.

It’s not often that Florida’s golf team heads 
into a tournament without any knowledge of 
the course, but that’s the exact problem the women’s team will face this weekend.
As the Gators head to Fayetteville, Ark., 
in hopes of winning their ninth Southeast-ern Conference title, they will be competing at Blessings Golf Club, a course that nobody on the team, not even coach Jan Dowling, has played before. 
“It’s a very difficult golf course I’ve heard, 
I’ve never been there. No one on our team has been there. So that makes our practice round as important as any practice round can be,” Dowling said. “We’ve got to learn a lot of in-formation in just 18 holes of golf.”
In addition to the practice round, Dowl-
ing believes that her team’s reduction in high scores will be a key factor in having a good performance this weekend. 
During the Allstate Sugar Bowl Collegiate Classic at the end of February, Florida was the only team that went two out of three rounds without any players carding a double-bogey, according to Dowling. 
“That to me was very significant despite 
the fact that we finished 10th at the event,” Dowling said. “It meant that we’re managing the golf course very well, it meant that our short games were very good [and] it meant that our team was making very good deci-sions out there.”
Playing well of late, freshman Camilla 
Hedberg leads the team in hitting 90.7 percent of fair -
ways and 73.8 percent of greens in regulation. 
Florida has improved 
its finishes from the beginning of the spring season. After having a 12th-place finish and a 10th-place finish in its first two tournaments, the women were able to win their home tour -
nament and place third at the Liz Murphey Collegiate Classic.
“They should feel very confident heading 
into the postseason, and that’s what we’re trying to do,” Dowling said.
