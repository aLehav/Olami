UF students and Gainesville residents can cast 
their ballots early for the March 19 city elections 
starting today.
Residents can vote at the Alachua County Su-
pervisor of Elections Ofﬁ  ce, 12 SE First St., until Sunday.
Early voting polls will be open from 9 a.m. to 5 
p.m. on weekdays, 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday and 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Sunday.
This year’s race has Ed Braddy, Scherwin L. 
Henry , Pete Johnson, Donald Shepherd Sr., Mark Venzke and incumbent Craig Lowe competing for the mayoral seat. Alfredo Espinosa, W.E. “Mac” McEachern and incumbent Randy Wells will vie for the District 4 City Commission seat.
There is also a charter amendment on the bal-
lot that would change the date of city elections and terms of ofﬁ  ce.
If the amendment passes, beginning in 2017 
city elections would take place every other odd-numbered year rather than every year.  It would also change mayoral and City Commission terms from their three-year terms that start in May to four-year terms that begin in January 2018.
In order to vote, residents will need a valid 
picture and signature ID or must have ﬁ  lled out a provisional ballot.
Pam Carpenter, supervisor of elections, said 
in the past, her ofﬁ  ce hasn’t seen many people in line during the early voting week.
“Any time would be a good time to come out 
and cast your ballot,” she said.Early 
voting forcity elections begins today

Two ospreys fret in the open skies 
above Paynes Prairie as their nest is held 
aloft by nothing more than a thin plate and the crane ties connected to it.
Far below, a combination of bucket 
trucks, cranes and post-hole diggers take down the aged and rotting wooden pow-er-line poles and then transfer wires to the steel replacements.Only then can the nest be secured to its 
new home and its inhabitants return.
Assessments by utility company Prog-
ress Energy Florida found 10 transmission-line poles that run through the park paral-lel to the southbound lane of U.S. Route 441 needed replacement. Two of them held occupied osprey nests the Florida Department of Environmental Protection requested be transferred to the new poles.
As of Monday, one nest had been suc-
cessfully moved, and its original inhabit-ants had already returned, David Jowers, a park manager at the preserve, wrote in an email.
As the ospreys move into mating sea-
son, it’s important any eggs remain undis-turbed, he wrote.
Workers in boom lifts must check the 
nests from a safe distance before work around the pole can start.

In the two and a half years since 
Midnight Cookies opened inside 
California Chicken Grill, the com-pany’s operation has grown, but the kitchen has remained the same.
The lack of space prompted own-
ers Jonathan and Jennifer MacAllis-ter to look for a new place.
After two years of searching, the 
couple announced they would move the late-night cookie establishment to its own stand-alone store. The new store, located at 3345 SW 34th St., Suite 1, will be opened by April, said Jonathan MacAllister.
He said the relocation will give 
his company a larger kitchen, in-crease menu options and expand delivery services to two additional apartment complexes. In addition, he said, the store will extend its hours during the day.“We’re trying to have a coffee 
house feel,” he said.
During Spring Break, the store 
closed to allow MacAllister and his team to prepare for the move.MacAllister said although a date 
for the grand opening hasn’t been set, the move won’t affect current business or delivery services.
April Burnett, a store manager, 
said she’s excited for the move be-cause it will give the store a chance to reach out to more customers.
“It’s going to do good for the 
company ,” she said. “It’s going to take off.”

March 11, 1977: Gainesville utility officials warned 
they will start shutting power off in 50 to 60 houses 
and apartments per day to crack down on the sky-rocketing number of residents who don’t pay their bills on time. UF student Cesar Pascual had power in his Regency Oaks apartment killed after failing to pay a utility bill he and his roommates contested was too high. The power was turned back on after he paid the $190 two-month utility bills — the highest Troy Phillips, regional utilities credit manager, had seen in his 28 years with the city.
March 10, 1988: Student Government Court 
formed a special investigation team to look into Ex-press Party member Scooter Willis’ runoff win for Student Body president. Senators refused to validate the election, citing rumors that professors wearing Express buttons told students they would get extra credit for voting.
March 15, 1995: A bill in the Florida Legislature 
threatened to reduce the underage blood alcohol limit. The bill proposed to lower the blood alcohol limit for anyone under the age of 21 to .02 instead of the .08 limit for all ages. Penalties under the bill included automatic driver’s license suspension if the person refused to have a blood alcohol test, six months of license suspension if the person was tested and found above the 0.2 limit, and one year of sus-pended license for each subsequent incident.
March 13, 2001: Gainesville police got a new drug 
dog thanks to a $5,000 donation by Joe Cirulli, owner of Gainesville Health and Fitness Center. It was the largest donation ever made by a private source to the GPD K-9 unit, according to GPD Cpl. Matt Necho-dom. The dog was named Maximus after the main character in “Gladiator,” Cirulli’s favorite movie. “We originally set out to have the name associated with the human body, and gluteus maximus wasn’t a very good name. Everyone knew I loved the movie ‘Gladiator’ since I saw it seven times. So, gluteus maximus became Maximus,” Cirulli said.

Forbes has released its 25 
Best Places To Retire, and the 
location of the Gator Nation clinched a spot on the list.
The list consists of cities 
throughout the country.
It includes three other 
Florida cities: Jacksonville, Clearwater and Orlando.
Gainesville is a top 
destination to retire in because of the cheap cost of living, above average air quality and the good weather, according to Forbes.
“We are blessed with an 
active and vibrant cultural scene,” City of Gainesville spokesman Bob Woods said. “There’s something to do for everyone — young and old.”
Woods said many retirees 
are drawn to the city because of the climate, close proximity to the beach and UF.
“The University of Florida 
is a flagship institution for the state of Florida and clearly is the host for a number of cultural events that take place throughout the year,” Woods said.
The Atrium at Gainesville 
retirement living community makes sure residents still get to participate in activities that keep them feeling young.
Enrichment coordinator 
Courtney South said residents get the opportunity to attend Gators baseball games and cheer on the team.
“It really gives them that 
reminiscing factor of enjoying things they used to do,” she said.
South said she believes 
many senior citizens come to Gainesville because there isn’t as much hustle and bustle as in bigger Florida cities.
“I feel like it gives them 
a more relaxing atmosphere while still being able to be busy,” South said. 
Other cities on the list 
include Asheville, N.C.; Austin, Texas; and Baton Rouge, La.Gainesville named a 
good place for retirees

City of Gainesville spokesmanwill be put on hold until proper 
permitting can be established or until the eggs hatch and young leave the nest,” Jowers wrote.
Sterling Ivey , spokesman for 
Progress Energy, said the new pole framings are more bird-friendly than the wooden predecessors, although some deterrents are also included to protect the poles and wires from the prairie’s heavy bird activity.
On the ground beneath the 
lines, a swath of prairie has been reduced to a puddled and muddy road churned daily by the various vehicles and equipment. Although the land is owned by the Depart-ment of Environmental Protec-tion, a right of way was permitted to Progress Energy.
“Restoration to any disturbed 
lands is done by restoring to ‘as-is’ or better conditions,” Ivey said. “This is regardless of the land be-ing a state land or customer prop-erty.”
Jowers wrote that the prairie 
has been invaded by woody plants in the last few years, and the equip-ment being used by Progress En-ergy, notably the Marsh Master, is what the basin needs to return to its intended swampy habitat.
“The Friends of Paynes Prairie, 
a citizen support organization, is currently raising funds to purchase a Marsh Master for Paynes Prairie Preserve to help gain access to the basin marsh for resource manage-ment,” Jowers wrote.
The project should be complet-
ed sometime in April, Ivey said.4, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, MARCH 11, 2013

A Gainesville man was ar -
rested Wednesday after police 
used DNA evidence to link him to a Feb. 23 attempted rape at The Enclave Apartments.
Gainesville Police charged 
Roderick Kantrel Pittman, 28, of 2725 SW 27th Ave., with armed robbery, aggravated as-sault, aggravated battery and sexual assault, according to a GPD arrest report.
The report provided addi-
tional details from when the crime was originally reported Feb. 25.
The incident started just af-
ter 3 a.m. Feb. 23 when a wom-an was walking down the sec-ond floor stairwell of Building D of the apartment complex, located at 3000 SW 35th Place, according to the report.
Pittman grabbed the wom-
an’s shoulder, spun her around and held a knife up to her throat. He demanded her keys, water bottle and cellphone, ac-cording to the report.
He then told the woman to 
bend over with her hands on the stairwell. While she was bent over, Pittman started to lift up her skirt, according to the report.
The woman fought back 
and ran from Pittman toward the parking lot. A friend, who was waiting in a car, heard a scream and ran to the stairwell. When she found Pittman and the woman, Pittman pulled out a black handgun and pointed it at the friend.Both women ran from 
Pittman to the car, called Gainesville Police and drove to Shands at UF. GPD officers ar -
rived at the complex and found Pittman coming out of the Building D stairwell, according to the report. He tried to run, but officers caught him.
During a search, police 
found two condoms and a bloody knife in Pittman’s pocket. When Pittman couldn’t explain why he was at the com-plex, officers arrested him on loitering and prowling charges, according to the report.
During a lineup, the woman 
and her friend couldn’t identify Pittman as the man who com-mitted the attack.
On Wednesday , however, 
the Florida Department of Law Enforcement reported a match between the blood on Pittman’s knife and a DNA sample from the woman, said GPD spokes-man Officer Ben Tobias.
Later that afternoon, GPD 
detectives waited for Pittman on a parking lot at the Ridge-mar Commons Apartments, located in the 3600 block of Southwest 34th Street, Tobias said.
When Pittman walked out 
to his car, he was arrested.
Tobias said Gainesville Po-
lice is still looking for the hand-gun used in the attack.
Pittman was booked into the 
Alachua County Jail at about 9 p.m. Wednesday, where he re-mained Sunday night with a $300,000 bond.

While most college students hit the beach this Spring 
Break, 12 UF students were preparing to talk to elected 
officials about equality issues.
Amber Paoloemilio, 21, is one of the UF students lob-
bying in Tallahassee for gay rights in Florida today and Tuesday.
“We are in a day and age when we should be able to 
marry anyone that we want,” the women’s studies and Spanish junior said. “I think it’s ridiculous that gay mar -
riage is still illegal, but we need to do whatever we can do, and so I’m getting myself out there.”
Paoloemilio is joining Equality Florida, a civil rights 
nonprofit organization focused on equality for Florida’s lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community.
Mallory Wells, public policy director for Equality 
Florida, said during the lobbying days, the organization brings people to talk about issues related to Florida’s LGBT community . Wells said they are fighting for the legalization of statewide domestic partnership for gay couples and the Florida Competitive Workforce Act, which would prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.
Paoloemilio, who is an intern for Equality Florida, 
said she’s also attending to take a stand for human 
rights.
“There is still so much inequality 
for women and people in lower socio-economic statuses. We need to keep working towards equality,” she said.
Gretchell Trochez, a 20-year-old 
UF political science sophomore, will 
also be lobbying.
“I have personal family stories in-
vested in equality and LGBT rights, 
so this is very important to go fight for my family,” she said.
She added, “This is the civil rights movement of our 
time, and you need to be a part of it.”UF students rally in Tally for gay rights

Eight Gainesville residents got 
a firsthand look at what it takes to 
be a firefighter during Gainesville Fire Rescue’s Second Annual Citi-zens Fire Academy on Saturday.
The all-day event was held at 
Gainesville Fire Rescue’s training facility at Fire Station No. 3, 900 NE Waldo Road.
GFR Fire Chief Gene Prince 
said the goal of the academy was to give citizens a glimpse into a day as a firefighter as well as show them how their tax money is being used.
“It’s important for the citizens 
to know that we are good stew-ards of the money they give us to run fire rescue services,” he said.
Donned in fire-retardant gear 
and protective goggles, citizens participated in four GFR scenari-os.Craig Segebarth, a 25-year-old 
research technician at the Flori-da Museum of Natural History , worked with other participants to operate a fire truck and its hoses.
He volunteered to run a fire 
hose up a four-story training tow-er.
The hose was more difficult to 
wield than he expected, Segebarth said.
“The kickback of the hose was 
similar to a gun,” he said.
Participants also practiced 
search-and-rescue techniques.
A water vapor machine filled a 
training center garage with dense gray fog. Participants peered through thermal imaging cameras to simulate how firefighters search for bodies in dense smoke.
The vehicle extrication was the 
most-anticipated activity of the day.  Joey Gonzalez, a firefighter 
who worked as an instructor at the event, explained that vehicle extrication is necessary in order to rescue people trapped in cars dur -
ing accidents.
Firefighters set up two cars to 
simulate a T-bone-style accident, and participants used chisels to knock out windows as well as hy-draulic tools to pry and tear apart the cars’ metal frames. Later, GFR officials held a demonstration on proper fire extinguisher usage.
Vanessa Schlachta, a Gainesville 
resident and mother of three chil-dren, said she found the demon-stration useful.
“It was a great refresher 
course,” she said.
In addition to the hands-on ac-
tivities, officials also shared stories about their experiences while on the job.
Nick Gonzalez, a firefighter 
and paramedic at Station No. 1, said his favorite part of his job is helping others.
“Every call is someone’s worst 
day ever,” he said.Citizens feel heat at Fire Academy

One of 3-year-old Hunter Whit-
ten’s favorite things to do is hang 
out with his dad.
On Saturdays, this means riding 
the hour-long Route 1 loop with his mom, Michelle Whitten, and watch-ing his father, Anson Whitten, drive a city bus.
But on March 2, Hunter braved 
the chilly weather with his family to watch his father compete in the Re-gional Transit System’s 15th annual Bus Roadeo.
Ten city bus drivers completed 
an 11-obstacle course on the driving pad behind the Gainesville Regional Airport to test their driving abilities as about 75 family members and friends watched  on the sidelines.
When contestant Antonio Cruz 
was announced to “La Bamba” blaring over the speaker system, six judges with clipboards climbed aboard the bus scrolling Cruz’s name on the destination sign.
The judges kept time, measured the smoothness of the ride and noted safety aspects. Sitting in the driver’s seat, Cruz, 58, hit the throttle and sent the bus flying toward the offset street obstacle. He weaved in and out of lines of cones.
Later, Cruz pulled alongside a 
row of yellow beams that simulated a curb. The bus stopped beside an  RTS sign planted in a cracked 5-gal-lon bucket filled with cement. “Bus stop,” he called, blaring the horn.
Outside, a team of volunteers 
measured the distance from the tires to the curb.
Frederick Mayer, one of the judg-
es, explained the distance should be 15 inches or less from the back tires and six inches or less from the front tires.
“The goal is for passengers to be 
able to step directly from the bus to the curb,” he said, yardstick in hand.
The judges winced as Cruz sped through a corridor of colorful bar -
rels. At the end was an orange cone, and hitting it meant losing points to-ward Cruz’s score.
The bus ground to a halt, stop-
ping before hitting the cone to finish the last challenge on the course.
“We lived,” said Roy Darnold, a 
smoothness of operation judge, as he lunged off the bus.
Cruz breathed a sigh of relief af-
ter he left the driver’s seat. He said it had been 10 years since he won the competition and was eager to hear the results following his run through the track.
After the contestants completed 
the course, the emcee summoned the drivers to line up on a strip of faded red carpet that faced the bleachers.
After a decade-long streak of 
losses, Cruz was named the winner of this year’s competition.
Clutching his trophy , Cruz said 
he was pleased with the victory.
“I’m just happy to finally break 
this jinx,” he said.

University Police will be 
buckling down on safety belt 
law enforcement through the end of the week with Florida’s annual Click It or Ticket cam-paign.
During the campaign, law 
officers will be conducting more traffic stops than usual to check for safety belt usage.
Seat belt infractions are non-
moving traffic violations that carry no points, but there is a fine of $104, said UPD special events coordinator Lt. William Gainey. The goal of the cam-paign is to increase seat belt us-age and bring awareness to the student community.
“Seat belt usage has contin-
ued to increase each year since the campaigns began,” said mo-torcycle officer David Watson.
Gainey said based on annu-
al surveys, Gainesville consis-tently ranks in the 80th to 90th percentiles in the state for seat belt usage.
“Gainesville always has 
high seat belt usage rates, but the campaign is an effort to fur -
ther increase productivity ,” he said.
UF student Melissa Daum 
said the campaign is great.
“Sometimes, as busy stu-
dents, we just hop in our cars without thinking,” said the 19-year-old finance sophomore, “but so many lives would be saved in those two seconds it takes to just buckle up.”UPD to tighten safety

Justin Timberlake is 
bringing comedy back
Dear Justin Timberlake,
Thank you. You made our Spring Break worthwhile.
Some of us escaped to faraway destinations full of 
snow or sand, but some of us had those dumb staycations. Stay-cations are when you do nothing at home for a week and call it relaxing. Although getting away from responsibilities can be exciting, it can also get real old real quick.
Enter JTimbz.He celebrated his ﬁ  fth time hosting “Saturday Night Live” 
by making it the highest-rated episode of the show so far this season, according to predictions made by Billboard based on preliminary Nielsen ﬁ  gures. 
What a breath of fresh air he brought to the semi-dragging 
season of “SNL.” Mostly, this year has had pretty successful hosts, but they needed something to revitalize viewers and to remind them why the show is a comedic titan.
Yes, there were a couple bumps in the middle of the episode 
that might have been weird or out-there sketches. Yes, people may complain about some of the sketches that reprised sketch premises and characters.
It doesn’t matter.It was a — as the kids say — pretty bomb-a-- episode.“His show was a thrilling, joyous, cameo-stuffed affair that 
easily ranks among this season’s best, second only perhaps to Martin Short’s Christmas episode,” reported Entertainment Weekly.
See, we just think it’s really important to consider the freakish 
amounts of work that go into a live sketch-comedy show.
Despite what happens in dress rehearsal, you have to put on 
an hour and a half of quality television. Costume changes, set changes, reading cue cards — all of that has to happen ﬂ  awless-ly. There’s even more pressure on the host of the episode.
“There are so many exciting things about hosting ﬁ  ve times,” 
Timberlake said in the beginning of his monologue. “You get to see old friends. You get to try new things. You get to inevitably let everyone down thanks to overly high expectations — thanks, Internet!”
Thankfully for everyone, Timberlake more than lived up to 
the hype we all put on this episode.
“Before the music business changed and singers went into 
arenas, there were people who came out of nightclubs who could sing and dance and do comedy ,” said “SNL” executive producer Lorne Michaels to The Wall Street Journal. “In another life, he might have been Dean Martin.”
The world doesn’t have to be all dubstep this and techno that. 
It can actually be talented and still have an amazing career.
This is the point in reading this article when we assume you 
think we’re reacting like an old woman — all, “Keep those kids off my digital lawn.”
Just hear us out. Let’s strive for equal parts quality , hard work 
and fun in our lives. Otherwise, what are we doing here?
Thank you, Justin Timberlake, for kicking butt in “SNL” last 
week. We’re inspired.
It was a nice distraction from daylight saving time. Damn.Welcome back from Spring Break, everyone! 
It’s time to put up the booze — well, until 
next Sunday, at least — put on our study hats 
and prepare for the long slog towards the ﬁ  nish line.
I hope everyone had fun and got out of Gainesville be-
cause it was cold here!
On Monday, the temperature in my house didn’t get 
above 50 the entire day. My roommate and I kept drinking 
coffee to keep our internal organs functioning. We would’ve turned on the heat, but we’re cheapskates.
But it got me thinking.See, I used to live in Colorado, and I wore shorts year-
round. I didn’t even own a pair of long pants. It would be 12 under and snowing, and I’d be walking the two miles from the bus stop to my house happy as a polar bear. I didn’t care! The cold didn’t bother me then.
Now, I shiver wearing a sweatshirt and jacket in 43 de-
grees. What the hell happened to me?
Fortunately, my life’s mission statement is “Find a pat-
sy.”
Whenever something happens that I might be to blame 
for, I ﬁ  nd somebody else to blame instead. It works occasion-ally , although usually I forget what the problem was in the ﬁ  rst place and go play guitar. This time I couldn’t do that.
My ﬁ  ngers were too stiff to play guitar. So I thought long 
and hard — for about 20 minutes before “Family Guy” came on TBS — and came up with several possible culprits.
First, I thought of the humidity.I’ve been told before — or maybe I made it up. I don’t 
really remember — that cold feels colder when it’s really hu-mid. It cuts straight through to your bones. I’m not sure how that works, but I’d be prepared to believe it.
But then I used my pocket psychrometer to measure the 
humidity and found out there was zero humidity in my house.
My roommate told me this was because my pocket psy-
chrometer was actually just a shard of glass with a zero painted on it, but I didn’t believe him because, hey, science. 
I continued my search for a scapegoat.I thought about blaming 
Gainesville Regional Utilities.
“Yeah,” I thought. “They’re the 
ones that made it so expensive to heat my house.” 
But then I remembered the 
times we have turned on the heat. It doesn’t turn off, and it only makes the house incrementally warmer. That’s because there are 
cracks in the house.
There are places where you look at the wall and can see 
the outside light.
We have high ceilings — “vaulted” ceilings, as the leasing 
company calls them — which do not help with the problem at all. Right above the high ceilings is an attic whose holes are not a ﬂ  aw but a design feature. Those holes release heat (because heat rises), and I’m pretty sure they’re the reason the bats are up there. And the pig ghost who makes noises in our walls every night.
I decided it wasn’t GRU I had to blame for being cold. It 
was my house. I started to bemoan my fate.
How could I have gotten into such a situation in life? How 
did I end up living in such a cold house? I thought back. I remembered.
That house costs me peanuts in rent. I’m poor and cheap. 
I’d rather pay peanuts in rent than be warm.
It dawned on me: I’m the one to blame for me being cold! 
I found my scapegoat: me!
Wait, dammit, that’s what I was trying to avoid.The moral I’m trying to expound is this: There are some 
situations in life when you can ﬁ  nd someone else to blame, but usually , if you trace it back far enough, you’ll ﬁ  nd it was really you who made your problems.
Instead, don’t worry about blame, and just live your life. 
It’s easier that way.

opinions@alligator.org MONDAY, MARCH 11, 2013 § ALLIGATOR, 7
In our society, women are expected to act and dress 
certain ways, and those cultural expectations are of-ten the standards by which we compare and assess 
ourselves. 
In order to reflect the golden standard of femininity de-
cided upon by society, we are often forced to define our -
selves by what we wear.
Coming from an artistic and eclectic environment, 
I never expected to be fashionably ambushed when I stepped foot onto UF’s campus. 
I wear nice clothes, present myself well and try to 
blend in, but there’s something about a college campus that makes girls forget who they are and how to dress.
What’s the difference between how feminine I feel 
versus how I thought I felt?
Girls obviously feel more pressure than guys to dress 
a certain way, which is just one fragment of the gender inequality in our society, but you would think every fe-male on campus was a carbon copy of one another.
Every girl wears the same style T-shirt and carries 
the same — ugly — bag. I never experienced that homo-geneity in high school, and coming to UF unquestion-ably changed me. 
The majority of females on campus present them-
selves with a group mentality, as if individuality cannot be expressed if femininity is desired as well.
I realized the first time I went home after starting 
school that I dressed differently. 
Normally, I feel somewhat inadequate or unfeminine 
on campus.
I do not do my hair every day, and I wear gym clothes 
to class. So what? When I go home, however, I dress up, and I love it. 
I don’t know if I feel the need to overcompensate for 
how I don’t dress at school or if I like to show off to my family how much college has changed me, but I wear dresses and do my makeup and feel like a girly girl, which never happens on campus.    
As Michael Kimmel states in “The Gendered Soci-
ety,” the sense of a gendered self does not depend on biological factors but, rather, those interactions and de-mands of social experiences.
Thinking more about the issue, I realized I, much like 
every other 18- to 24-year-old, compare myself to those around me.
I look at the “Greeks” and wonder where they got 
their flower-printed hair bows — even though I think they’re hideous.
When surrounded by such fem-bots, who wouldn’t 
feel less feminine?
The trick to not letting it bother me, I have found, is 
to try dressing fashionably away from school. 
Am I embarrassed to be seen attempting to be 
trendy, or do I think I look bad in anything other than a T-shirt?
No, but somehow, I feel the 
need to rebel against the homoge-neity and only attempt fashion-able styles in a more comfortable and less-judgmental environ-
ment.
My mother took notice and said, “You wear some-
thing new every time you come home.”
“Maybe so,” I replied, knowing perfectly well I saved 
my dress for that occasion because I wear the same doz-en T-shirts and running shorts every other day. 
Going home is my excuse to look nice, dress up and 
feel feminine. 
The two versions of me do not necessarily mean I do 
not know who I am, but it means I haven’t found a way to splice those identities into one.
When I leave college, the dresses and the sweatpants 
will have to intermingle because they are both parts of me. 
I never want to carry an ugly neon-paisley-print 
backpack,  but I want to look as feminine as I do when I go home and still feel like me.
The point of addressing college fashion trends and 
how they influence femininity is to highlight how girls make other girls feel — it is a cycle.
One small group reinforces another until everyone 
feels the need to wear the same thing and just accept that as being indicative of normal. 
Femininity is not easily defined, but apparently, on a 
college campus, it has a certain image. 
The college campus is arguably what Kimmel would 
call a gendered institution, where the institution itself reflects gender differences and, therefore, reinforces the social expectations of each gender.
I am a female, and I do not succumb to the pressures 
of all ugly fashion trends, but those choices influence the way I feel and identify as a woman.
Away from the college bubble, I am more me. Out in 
the world, surrounded by people of all different ages, backgrounds and education levels, I become a more rounded individual. I am free to dress how I want and express my femininity as I choose.
The fashionably stifling environment that is UF was 
supposed to be a wide-open blank slate to expand my view of the world, but instead, I am surrounded by a lot of the same. That’s too bad.
My wish is other girls realize they will have even new 
pressures to dress differently when they leave here. 
The societal issue of female pressure to look a certain 
way may not go away, but the ways girls let it influence them can.

Speaking Out
As a person of the female sex, I am often told by 
my peers what is considered appropriate for me to do with my life.
It often surprises people when I tell them I am study-
ing to be a biochemist. In a field dominated by men, it’s difficult to find someone who would not judge your career choice by your biological sex.
Certainly, I have yet to encounter that one person 
who would not think my major is ridiculous or too big a challenge for a woman.
Although I do as well as my male peers academical-
ly, in their minds, I am a weakling. And because most of my courses are about 90 percent male, I have learned to ignore the sexist commentaries and attitudes I expe-rience because of my gender.
However, if something positive must come from 
something negative, I would say the constant criticism has only encouraged me to prove my academic abilities are not dictated by my sex.
I believe women are intimidated by careers in fields 
such as physics, chemistry and mathematics, among others.
Because these subjects are mostly taught and stud-
ied by men, these fields offer very little, if any, oppor -
tunities for women to succeed.
Due to criticism and discrim-
ination against females, women have become hesitant to attempt careers in fields largely popu-lated by men.
Furthermore, during a brief comparison of UF’s sci-
ence department faculty, I found in the more quanti-tative sciences, which require analytical assessments and calculations, the ratio of men to women tends to be greater.
However, in the more organic and natural sciences, 
women are in either equal or greater numbers than men.
This is part of the proper social conduct and stan-
dards we have been told to follow by our families and peers.
Unfortunately, in the Western culture we live in, a 
person’s sex will dictate the type of toys he or she plays with as a child, his or her wardrobe, acceptable favorite color, behavior, manners and career path.
Hence, if a person such as me breaks these set so-
cial boundaries, he or she will be discriminated against, criticized and ridiculed.
As social individuals, we are exposed every day to 
people and things that will shape our future decisions — factors that are affecting women’s career choices.
So, how can this social dictation of women’s lives be 
changed? First, gender inequality issues must be made pertinent to the general public in order to encourage in-dividuals to change the social expectations for women.
For instance, at UF, the Women’s Student Associa-
tion attempts to empower women and make their so-cial issues relevant.
Also, women must be taught not to be afraid of par -
ticipating in hypermasculine environments, as well as learning to understand that gender identity should not dictate their social and academic interests.
These steps are a few of the many actions we must 
place in effect as a society to modify gender roles.
The lack of general education about gender inequal-
ity is one of the most important contributing factors of ignorance toward women’s roles in society.
Understanding how to subtly approach individuals 
and our Western culture with solutions for this issue can be challenging.
However, this is an essential action that will pro-
gressively change the presumptions of sex roles, allow-ing women to make decisions about their lives free of judgment and criticism, so they may practice, study and work in their most-desired career field.

Behind the music
Daryl Brown, 34, also known as Deal’a, is a rising local 
artist best known for his fall hit “It’s A Swamp Thang,” which 
regularly played in Ben Hill Griffin Stadium. He recently released a new single, “Gators Eat Haters.” However, legal issues have impeded his progress. Brown was placed on house arrest in December and has an 11 p.m. curfew, both of which prevent him from traveling to promote his music.
Photo story by Javier Edwards
Brown records a verse from a song in his home studio. His brother, Brandon Taylor, also serves as his audio engineer.�  Mixtape disks line the trunk of Brown’s Chevrolet. He is slated to have his 
first performance March 23 at the Florida Theater.
� Deal’a discusses the details for his first performance with a concert 
promoter.Brown prepares to leave his home, where his girlfriend, Valerie Heiring, left, and 1-year-old niece, Serenity Taylor, visit him.
� Brown reveals his house arrest anklet. After a recent run-in with the law, his house arrest period was 
prolonged. He is scheduled to appear in court later this month.
� Brown takes 
inventory of his mixtape, “Deal’a.” The mixtape is his first release.
Brown greets his 
grandmother as she returns from work. He makes frequent visits to her home throughout the week. �MONDAY, MARCH 11, 2013

Gators in the NBA
Chicago Bulls center Joakim Noah scored 18 points 
and grabbed 17 rebounds in a 90-81 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers on Sunday in Los Angeles.JOSH JURNOVOY
Alligator Staff Writer
 
A day after playing what coach Kevin 
O’Sullivan called one of their best games 
of the season, the Gators had one of their worst outings to date. 
Indiana continued to pound the ball 
while Florida (8-9) lost the stroke it found at the plate on Saturday in Sunday’s 7-4 loss at McKethan Stadium to give the Hoo-siers the series win. “I know what good hitting clubs look 
like,” O’Sullivan said. “They got a good hitting club.”
Indiana jumped out to a lead in the top 
of the first on Florida for the third straight game.Catcher Kyle Schwarber hit a solo home 
run in the second at-bat of the game to give the Hoosiers (8-3) the lead for good. Schwarber went 10 for 14 at the plate with four RBI in the series.
“I’m not quite sure I’ve ever seen a 
guy have a weekend like that,” O’Sullivan said.
“He hit balls down, off the plate. He hit 
balls in. He hit balls up. He hit soft. He hit hard.”
Schwarber, Indiana’s two-hole hitter, 
combined with third and fourth hitters Sam Travis and Scott Donley to go 22 for 37 during the weekend at the plate with 11 RBI. 
“It’s kind of like how we were for three 
years with Preston (Tucker) and Mike (Zunino),” O’Sullivan said. “Now I kind of know how it feels. You always turn around, and it looks like they’re coming up again.”
The Hoosiers recorded 36 hits in the se-
ries.
Despite their success at the plate on 
Sunday, O’Sullivan was pleased with the performance of freshman starter Eric Han-hold, who gave up four runs and seven hits in four innings of work.
“I thought Eric threw the ball good,” 
O’Sullivan said.
“Sometimes the line doesn’t say how a 
guy threw. I liked his demeanor. I liked his aggressiveness. The ball was coming out of his hand good. He threw three pitches for strikes.”
In the third inning, the Hoosiers ex-
tended their lead to 3-0 after Schwarber 
Freshman Taylore Fuller hit 
the deciding home run in the Florida softball team’s 2-0 win against Auburn on Sunday. See story, page 15.

Following an 82-73 loss to top-
seeded and ninth-ranked Tennessee 
in the quarterfinals of the South-eastern Conference Tournament on Friday, Florida awaits its postseason fate, hoping for an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament. 
However, unlike last season when 
the Gators snuck in as a No. 9 seed — the selection committee acknowl-edged Florida was one of the last four teams into the Big Dance a year ago — there will likely be little drama while awaiting their destination this year. 
The NCAA Tournament selections will be announced on March 18 be-ginning at 7 p.m.
But the Gators likely will not hear 
their name called until later in the evening when the WNIT bracket is revealed. 
Florida (18-14, 6-10 SEC) boasts a 
resume unlikely to warrant an oppor -
tunity to play in the NCAA Tourna-ment. 
Of UF’s 18 victories this season, 
only two have come against teams with an RPI of 50 or better. UF beat LSU on Jan. 6 and Pacific on Dec. 7 — squads with respective RPIs of 33 and 43 — but were otherwise unable to notch a signature victory.Gators await postseason fate

In the heat of Saturday afternoon’s game 
against Kentucky, Florida went cold. 
The No. 11 Gators (24-6, 14-4 Southeast-
ern Conference) went scoreless in the final 
7:36 of their 61-57 road loss to the Wildcats 
in Lexington, Ky., missing their final 11 field-goal at-tempts.
UF also committed five turnovers dur -
ing Kentucky’s 11-0 run to close the game.  
“I can’t put the ball in the basket for 
them,” Donovan said.
“I cannot make a jump hook, but I can 
try to put them in positions where they can be successful.”
Wildcats guard Julius Mays said: “We 
were getting stops, and they couldn’t score. We just kept fighting and fighting.”Prior to Saturday’s game, Donovan said 
that the Gators needed to eliminate wast-ed possessions, which he defined as plays where his team takes bad shots, turns over the ball or does not take advantage of open looks. 
But UF wasted plenty of opportunities 
down the stretch against UK. 
At the 4:53 mark, guard Mike Rosario 
sent an errant pass to guard Scottie Wil-bekin, which Kentucky guard Archie Good-win intercepted.
Goodwin then drove to the other end for 
a two-handed slam to cut Florida’s advan-tage to 57-55. 
Two offensive possessions later, Wil-
bekin looked to guard Kenny Boynton on the right wing. Unfortunately for the Gators, Boynton cut to the top of the key and Wilbekin’s pass made its way to Flor -
ida’s bench. Offensive cold streak dooms UF
see hoops, p Age 14UF Bask etballhit a single and Travis drove him in with a 
triple down the left-field line.
Donley followed with a single to center 
to plate Travis.
“We probably need to pitch in effective-
ly more,” O’Sullivan said. “Guys can’t just stand there comfortable. I’m not saying by no means hit anybody, but you got to lo-cate in.”
IU added two runs in the fifth, one in 
the seventh and another in the eighth on a Schwarber RBI double to go up 7-0 be-fore UF scored four in the bottom of the inning. 
Florida came into the series on a season-
high four-game winning streak before los-ing Friday’s game 4-1.
The Gators rebounded to win 6-4 on 
Saturday behind a 4-for-4 day at the plate from Casey Turgeon.
O’Sullivan said he hadn’t decided on 
a starter for Tuesday’s game against FSU, but he expects to see fewer runs from the opposition.
“Do we have to locate better? Yeah.” 
O’Sullivan said.
“But if we compete and we get after it 
and cut the ball loose, our command gets a little bit better. We’ll get better as a team — certainly as a pitching staff.”

win against Arkansas on Feb. 28 in the O’Connell Center.

Junior point guard Scottie Wilbekin drives the lane during Florida’s 66-40 win against 
Vanderbilt on Wednesday in the O’Connell Center.
Butler says Florida 
has learning to do
“We’re obviously disappointed,” coach Amanda 
Butler said following her team’s loss to Tennessee in 
the SEC Tournament on Friday.
“We didn’t come here to play close or make it re-
spectable (or) with any other expectation except to win.”
Butler has repeated that message numerous times 
this season but continues to be troubled with similarly frustrating results. 
Florida faced nine teams during conference play 
that were ranked entering Sunday. Butler’s squad topped LSU and lost the other eight contests by just 8.4 points per game.
But beating LSU does less to legitimize Florida’s 
postseason merit than defeating No. 12 Georgia did last season.
The Gators then went on to upset eighth-seeded 
Ohio State in the NCAA Tournament before falling to eventual-champion Baylor in the next round. 
Without a similar victory — plus losses to both Ole 
Miss and Missouri, two teams that struggled mightily in conference play — UF will likely settle for its fourth trip to the WNIT in six seasons. 
“We still got a lot of learning to do, a lot of growing 
up to do in terms of how to bring your best over and over and over again, possession to possession to pos-session, half to half,” Butler said.
“We still have too many people that play a great 
second half or lead us in the first half and then are no-where to be found (in) the second half.”
Jaterra Bonds, who led the Gators in scoring during 
conference play, continued to be a catalyst in UF’s two games in the SEC Tournament. 
Bonds became the 22nd player in program history 
to eclipse 1,000 points in her career by averaging 17.5 points against Arkansas and Tennessee. 
“We just didn’t execute,” Bonds said, “offensively 
(or) defensively.”

On UF’s next play, Wilbekin heaved 
the ball to a wide-open Casey Prather, 
hoping the forward could finish with a dunk. But Wilbekin’s lob sailed over Prather’s hands.   
“The play was well-executed in 
terms of screening and those kinds of things,” Donovan said. “We didn’t de-liver the ball correctly.”
With 3:17 remaining, forward Erik 
Murphy drove down the right side of the lane and was called for an offen-sive foul after charging into Kentucky center Willie Cauley-Stein. 
After committing numerous turn-
overs, Florida failed to convert a handful of well-executed possessions into points. 
Center Patric Young missed an 
open reverse layup with 2:52 left after receiving a bounce pass from Murphy in the post. 
“We run a play and we get Patric 
Young underneath the basket,” Dono-van said. “You know what I mean? How much better can you execute?”
UF’s most crucial miss came with 
15 seconds remaining.
When Boynton drove by his de-
fender, Wildcats guard Ryan Harrow, he attempted a mid-range jumper af-ter gaining separation.
Although Boynton’s shot could not 
find net, Donovan thought the attempt was a decent look. 
“In those situations, you’re not get-
ting a wide-open shot,” Donovan said.  “It was unchallenged. There wasn’t a hand in his face. … It wasn’t like a high-percentage, great, great shot. Probably not. Was it a bad shot? Cer -
tainly wasn’t a bad shot.”
Florida’s failure to score down the 
stretch helped Kentucky (21-10, 12-6 SEC) earn its first win this season against a top-15 opponent and boost its NCAA tournament hopes. 
UF owns the No. 1 seed in this 
week’s SEC Tournament and will play either No. 8 seed Georgia or No. 9 seed LSU on Friday at 1 p.m.
But after Saturday’s loss, the 
Gators’ chances for a No. 1 seed in the Big Dance are doubtful.hoopS , from page 13

Florida only managed one hit 
against Auburn on Sunday, but it 
was a big one.
Freshman Taylore Fuller, who 
had just six hits coming into the game, sent the first pitch she saw from Tigers pitcher Lexi Davis over the center-field fence.
“[Davis] had been throwing 
first-pitch strikes consistently throughout the lineup,” Fuller said.
“So I knew it was going to be a 
strike … I just trusted my hands and went with the pitch.”
Fuller’s third-inning solo blast 
was all the No. 4 Gators (25-2, 1-1 Southeastern Conference) need-ed in their 2-0 win in the rubber game against the Tigers (18-7, 1-2 SEC).
Fuller got on base all three 
times she came to the plate, drawing a walk in her second at-bat and reaching on an error in the third.
But the rest of Florida’s of-
fense was stagnant, and Fuller was stranded each of those two times.
The Gators added a second 
run in the fourth inning. Sopho-more Lauren Haeger walked to open the frame, and Briana Little was hit by a pitch, putting run-ners on first and second.
Senior Kelsey Horton dropped 
down a sacrifice bunt, and Jes-sica Damico lifted a fly ball to left field, scoring Haeger on a close play at the plate.
Aside from those two runs, 
Florida had trouble plating run-ners.
Florida left five on base in 
their 5-4 loss to Auburn on Satur -day, and their situational hitting did not get better on Sunday.
The Gators had runners on 
base in every inning, but the of-fense’s lack of hits stranded near -
ly all of them on the base paths. Florida was 0 for 3 with runners in scoring position and 0 for 7 with runners on base.
“It’s always frustrating to 
leave runners in scoring posi-tion,” Fuller said.
“We just have to learn how to 
work through it.”
Though the offense struggled, 
two runs were enough for Han-nah Rogers.
The junior right-hander picked 
up her 13th win of the season af-ter being saddled with the loss on Saturday.
“I used the loss as motivation 
to just go out there and play my best,” Rogers said.
Rogers cruised through the 
first four innings, allowing only three base runners on two hits and a walk. But in the fifth, the junior got into her first jam of the day.
Rogers walked a batter and 
gave up a single to consecutive batters but escaped the jam when Tigers shortstop Kelsey Bogaards popped up to second baseman Kelsey Stewart, who threw the runner out at first to complete the double play.
An inning later, Rogers 
worked into a similar jam, walk-ing the leadoff batter. The next reached first on a fielding error. But a flyout, a sacrifice bunt and a groundout later, she returned to the dugout with her sixth score-less frame.
Rogers got two groundouts 
and a foul out in the final inning to end Florida’s ninth game in 10 days.
“I think we’re a little bit tired,” 
coach Tim Walton said. “We didn’t necessarily hit the ball as well as we’re capable of.”

After the second round of the Southern Highlands 
Collegiate Masters in Las Vegas all but eliminated the 
Gators from contention, Florida rallied to finish in the top 10 in the championship round. 
But UF’s comeback was not enough.California took control of the tourney after the sec-
ond round. 
The Golden Bears were the only team to finish 
with a score under par, accomplishing the feat by eight strokes (856).
“We played a little better today,” coach Buddy Al-
exander said in a release.
“We were able to move up the lea-
derboard.”
Florida failed to play up to its 
No. 10 ranking against fellow Top-25 
squads.
Every team that finished ahead of the Gators dur -
ing the three-day tourney is currently ranked among the top 13 squads in the nation, according to Golf-Week.com.
Although Florida has yet to earn an individual or 
team championship in the spring, there were some bright spots at the Southern Highlands Collegiate Masters.
Especially encouraging for UF was the play of 
freshman A.J. Crouch. 
Crouch earned the best result of any Gator, nar -
rowly missing out on a top-10 finish.
He shot a 73 (+1), 73 (+1) and 72 (E) to finish tied 
for 11th. Crouch started in the fifth spot after playing spar -
ingly this year. 
In addition to Crouch, Eric Banks’ performance 
was a pleasant surprise for Florida.
Banks, who continues to improve coming off 
open-heart surgery, shot a team-low 71 (-1) in the first round and a 72 (E) in the  final round. 
He finished tied for 25th and could have achieved 
an even better finish had he carded a score better than his 79 (+7) during the second round. 
Tyler McCumber, the Gators’ team captain, earned 
Florida’s second-best finish, ending the tournament in 24th. 
McCumber played solid golf after shooting just 
five over for the tournament following his final round score of 74 (+2).
Beyond Crouch, Banks and McCumber, Florida 
finished with disappointing results in the rain-soaked tournament. 
T.J. Vogel could not get anything going after shoot-
ing a 78 (+6) in the second round and a 79 (+7) in the final round to finish tied for 62nd. 
J.D. Tomlinson failed to get any type of rhythm 
after shooting a 79 (+7) in both the second and final rounds.
Tomlinson finished tied for 71st.“Golf is a strange game,” Alexander said. “Last 
year, Tomlinson and Vogel were our low scorers, and they (have) struggled this year. This year, our four and five guys (Banks and Crouch) did well. We still have a lot of work to do.”
Florida’s next competition will be the Chris Schen-
kel Invitational beginning on March 15 in Statesboro, Ga.Gators finish eighth in Las Vegas

Coach Mike Holloway and 
Florida’s bid to win a fourth 
straight NCAA Indoor Champi-onship fell short on Saturday in Fayetteville, Ark. 
But finishing second behind 
top-ranked Arkansas, Holloway was still pleased with the effort of his men’s team. 
The Razorbacks’ performance 
was simply too much to match.
“That’s the most we’ve scored 
at the national championships since I’ve been here and to get beat by 15, I don’t know what to say,” Holloway said. “We came out here and competed well, had seasonal bests across the board. That’s what we train for, that’s what we live for, and we have nothing to hang our heads about. 
“Of course we came here and 
wanted to win. We wanted to be national champions again. But being national runner-up and performing the way we did, we left our hearts and souls out here, and I couldn’t be more proud of these young men.”
Sophomore jumper Marquis 
Dendy and junior hurdler Eddie Lovett combined to account for 25 of the men’s 59 points during the meet. 
Dendy leapt to a national 
championship — as well as new personal and school records — in the men’s long jump with a NCAA-leading distance of 8.28 meters on Friday.
“This track facility is a great 
place to jump,” Dendy said. “I felt really, really good here. I just had to do it like I did at [the Southeastern Conference Indoor Championships].” 
Said Holloway of Dendy’s 
performance: “I’m very proud of him. It’s his first NCAA champi-onship, and it got us off to a great start.”
Lovett brought home a na-
tional title of his own in the men’s 60m hurdles. Clocking a time of 7.50 seconds — good for a per -
sonal record, a school record, an NCAA Indoor Championship meet record and the fourth-fast-est time in NCAA history.
“I felt pretty good,” Lovett 
said. “It wasn’t the best start like I wanted, but I made it up at the end. I’m just happy. If I got my steps and technique right, it would all fall into place.”
Holloway added: “Eddie is 
the kind of guy where he could have a perfect start and still say it wasn’t. That’s just how he and (hurdles) coach (Erin) Tucker are.
“What I’ll tell you is watching 
his transformation … it’s always great when you can break that ice and watch him come around. He’s been focused like this since August when he started. I’m ex-tremely proud of him.”
Both Dendy and Lovett set pre-
vious personal bests at the SEC Indoor Championships, which were also held in Fayetteville. 
Although the women’s team 
placed 13th at the NCAA In-door Championships, Holloway was pleased with several of his athletes’ results in individual events.
“We talked to the women 
about having more pride, and they came out and ran season’s best in the 4x4, season’s best in the mile for Agata (Strausa) and a new PR for Ciarra (Brewer),” Holloway said.
“The Gators left their mark on 
the building. Now we’re outside where we live and breathe, and we’ll see them in a few months.”
With the indoor season offi-
cially over, Florida looks to utilize the end results from the NCAA meets moving forward into the outdoor season. The men’s team aims to repeat as NCAA outdoor national champions in 2013.  
“It’s going to help us be better 
outdoors. It’s a motivation, it’s a better purpose, a better focus,” Holloway said.
“Anytime we want to slack 
a little, I’ll just bring the trophy out to the middle of the infield at practice so they can see it and re-member we got second indoors. We didn’t do anything wrong this weekend. Eddie Lovett, Omar (Craddock), Marquis (Dendy), Sean Obinwa … everyone did their absolute best this week-end.”
