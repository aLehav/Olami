County sends
officials to DC
By MATT HARRINGER
Alligator Writer
The Alachua County Com-
mission sent a delegation to
Washington, D.C., this week
to ask the county's elected of-
ficials to support a cleanup of
a local environmental night-
mare.
Commissioner Paula M.
DeLaney and Legislative Af-
fairs Director Rick Mills met
with Rep. Corrine Brown, staff
from Rep. Cliff Stearns and
Sen. George LeMieux.
The delegation urged the
federal lawmakers to support
cleaning up the Cabot/Kop-
pers site, which has been a
serious environmental issue
for Alachua County since the
1980s.
The commission also re-
quested $2.6 million for educa-
tion programs, $4 million for
the county's homeless initia-tives, $750,000 to revamp Santa
Fe Hills' water system and to
get funding for green-collar
jobs.
The county already sup-
ports all of the programs, but
federal funding in the form of
millions of dollars in federal
appropriations keep the pro-
grams alive.
Sen. LeMieux said he will
not sup-
port earmark
spending, or
funding for
specific pro-
grams and in-
stitutions.
Detaney This means
he will most
likely vote against the funding
of these programs for Alachua
County.
"We don't come and ask for
money for anything we're not
already spending on," DeLa-
ney said.

0 HE SPOKE TO A CROWD OF ABOUT
700 PEOPLE.

In the office of Supreme Court Justice
Clarence Thomas is a bust with a plaque that
reads, "Old Man Can't is dead -I helped
bury him."
The quote serves as a tribute to Thomas'
grandfather, who taught him to never quit.
Thomas passed on the same message of
perseverance Wednesday in front of an au-
dience of about 700 at the Marcia Whitney
Schott Courtyard in the UF Levin College of
Law.
"You all have a better chance of becoming
president than I did of becoming a justice on
the Supreme Court," he said. "The question
is: Do you have the will to prepare?"

When Atlantic Southeast Air-
lines set out to collect 3,500 shoes
for victims of the earthquake in
Haiti, the company didn't know
the Gainesville branch alone would
come close to meeting the goal.
The airline is collecting shoes
as part of Soles4Souls' larger cam-
paign to donate 1 million shoes to
earthquake victims.
With help from the Gainesville
Police Department, Rotary Club
and other organizations, ASA has
at downtown deli
danced to Taylor Swift's "You Belong With
Me" as he dunked his food in a water cup
and ate it without hesitation.
After time was up, Sibley said he was too
full to think.
"As an amateur bodybuilder, few things
in life have conquered me," he said. "That
sandwich is one of them."

Murphree residents celebrate
Black history Month
The Murphree Area Council
will host its first BYOB: bring
your own background event
Saturday in order to broaden the
cultural celebration of Black His-
tory Month.
MAC residents and resident
assistants will be supporting
Haiti and staging various cul-
tural performances at "Showcase
your Culture."
The free event will take place
from 1 p.m. until 3 p.m. at the
Murphree Area Commons.
Courtney Hubbard, an RA
for Sledd Hall said she chose a
hand print graphic to symbolize
the act of reaching out to people
of other cultures, and it also rep-
resents individualism because
every person's fingerprints are
unique.
RAs will be collecting cash
and material contributions to do-
nate to Club Creole for the relief
effort in Haiti, said Caitlin Plow-
field, an RA for Murphree.
Traditionally, the February
event is specifically geared to-
ward commemorating Black
History Month, Plowfield said.
But this year, the RAs have de-
cided to make the event more
inclusive by incorporating mul-tiple cultures.
She said those attending should
look forward to good food, aware-
ness of different cultures and satis-
faction of the soul.
"I think it shows the global
awareness of students at UF to
be able to come together and do a
program like this," Plowfield said.

UF's Gospel Choir to give an-
nual concert today
University Gospel Choir will
host its annual spring concert Fri-
day at 7 p.m. at the Phillips Center
for the Performing Arts.
Gospel Extravaganza, an event
co-sponsored by Student Govern-
ment Productions, will feature
Ricky Dillard, a gospel recording
artist and director of the Grammy
Award-nominated New Genera-
tion Chorale. It is one of the Black
Student Union's events for Black
History Month.
"By the term 'extravagant,' it's
big in the sense that it's in a big
location. We have big voices and
we're expecting a big amount of
people," said Courtney Amaro,
the choir's special events coordi-
nator.
This year's venue has 1,700
seats, and the choir's Vice Presi-
dent Alton Edmond wants to fill
each one.
Friday's event will be one of the
largest gospel celebrations held in
the Gainesville area in nearly five
years, said Cortney Whitlow, the
choirs public relations director.
Dillard was paid about $8,000
to perform and to be a guest di-
rector at Gospel Extravaganza,
Amaro said.
Student Government gave the
gospel choir a $10,000 grant to help
pay, she said.
"We chose him because he's a
crowd teaser," Amaro said. "He's
been at this for almost 20 years. He
is capable, available and willing."

ZipCarts offers free Friday rides
By TATIANA QUIROGA
Alligator Contributing Writer
Students will have a new way
to travel around campus on Fri-
days in February.
Starting today, they can catch
free ZipCarts rides from 10:30
a.m. to 2:30 p.m.
ZipCarts are energy-efficient
carts that hold six passengers.
They normally cost $3 per person
per ride and provide nighttime
transportation throughout down-
town Gainesville.
Students can flag down the
drivers of the carts and ask for
rides, said Justin Root, public re-
lations senior and UF Bateman
Team member.
Root said three carts will be
used for Free Ride Fridays.
The rides are a part of the UFBateman Team's "You + Me =
censUS" public relations cam-
paign.
In the Bateman Case Study
Competition, UF's team com-
petes with teams across the na-
tion to create the most effective
campaign for the U.S. Census.
Bateman Team members will
be driving the ZipCarts, and they
hope to talk to students about
the importance of completing the
census, he said.
Riding the ZipCarts will hope-
fully give students extra time to
complete the census form, Root
said.
Root said census data affects
local businesses.
When Root met with the co-
owners of ZipCarts in the fall,
they were applying for a federal
grant that they didn't receive.
If more people fill out thecensus, the data collected will
be more complete and will help
estimate the number of possible
ZipCarts clients, Root said.
The data would help deter-
mine the amount of money that
should be awarded to local busi-
nesses through grants, Root said.
Ryan Clarke, co-owner of Zip-
Carts, said partnering with the
Bateman Team is a good market-
ing opportunity.
Clarke said students may be
more likely to hitch rides after
participating in Free Ride Fri-
days.
Rachel Wheatley, a nutri-
tio0nal sciences freshman, said
she will probably complete the
census form and may even hop
on a cart.
"If I saw it, and it wasn't over-
crowded with people, I might
hitch a ride," Wheatley said.

Sister Hazel Williams is no stranger to charity.
Williams, a Gainesville resident who has done
ministry work for about 65 years, said she has been
to Haiti on missions many times in the past, her most
recent trip after the earthquake.
Williams, who is the inspiration for the Gaines-
ville-based rock band of the same name, has seen a lot
in her work and travels, but she said she'll never be
able to clear the images of Haitians eating dirt patties
with leaves from her memory.
"I wanted to do everything in my power to help
these people," Williams said. "The earthquake is not
from man. People, however, can prevent starvation."
Williams, head of the Sister Hazel Angel of Mercy
Ministries, is collecting materials to send to Haiti for
earthquake victims.Williams estimated that she's filled seven to eight
storage units with furniture, clothing and other neces-
sities.
The Peaceful Paths Thrift Store, where she stores
donated items, is overflowing with piles of bags filled
with essentials, and Williams has no plan to stop col-
lecting.
"You feel good when you're doing something,"
she said. "I'm fearless in what I'm doing."
She said she is trying to coordinate with the Miami
Dolphins and the UF men's basketball team to help
with her relief efforts.
Local Although she's hoping to raise as
News much money as she can, Williams re-
fused to disclose how much she has
raised, only noting there's much more needed for the
Haitian people.
"You don't sound the trumpet when you give
alms," she said, referring to a passage in the Gospel
of Matthew. "Do [works] in private, and your reward
will be in heaven."

istries, call 352-378-9496.

A new program at UF will open
doors for students concentrating on
special education.
The project, "Preparing Re-
searchers in Assistive Technology
Application in Inclusive General
Education Contexts for Students
with Significant Disabilities," will
offer full scholarships to three in-
coming doctoral students to allow
them to conduct research and learn
about changing technology, said
Diane Ryndak, associate professor
in special education and principal
investigator of the project.
Students applied to the College
of Education graduate program in
October, and Ryndak is in the pro-
cess of choosing the three recipi-
ents.
"These students will read the
most recent research," Ryndaksaid, "and they will conduct new
research of their own, which is all
focused on helping children with
special needs."
"There is a national trend
of decreasing special edu-
cation faculty. Programs
such as Project PRAIS
will fill positions that are
already vacant."
Diane Ryndak
associate professor in special
education
The project will be funded by
an $800,000 grant from the U.S.
Department of Education, Ryndak
said. The Office of Special Educa-
tion Programs developed a board
of officials to look over applying
universities and chose about 10
proposals, including UF's, out ofhundreds.
UF's College of Education will
receive $200,000 a year for up to
four years. Along with the three in-
coming doctoral students, the uni-
versity will fund eight postdoctoral
fellows, who will each work a se-
mester at UF during the four years.
"There is a national trend of de-
creasing special education faculty,"
Ryndak said. "Programs such as
Project PRAIS will fill positions that
are already vacant."
Students will be working on
the project in three areas: helping
children with severe disabilities,
working to include children with
disabilities in general education
classes and learning about assistant
technology, which will help stu-
dents in the classroom, said Ann-
Marie Orlando, the coordinator of
Project PRAIS.
"It's hard to get through a doc-
toral program," Ryndak said. "A
grant that pays for full tuition and
funds all research will make life
easier."

Event honors Parks
By ERICA JOHNSON
Alligator Contributing Writer
More than 50 people filled the Wil-
helmina Johnson Center Thursday
night to celebrate the birthday of the
renowned civil rights activist Rosa
Parks with poetry, songs, presenta-
tions and dance.
In 1955, Parks, who would have
turned 97 Thursday, refused to give
up her bus seat to a white person in
Montgomery, Ala.
Her actions that day led to the
Montgomery Bus Boycott.
The Rev. Milford Lewis Griner,
chairman and founder of the Rosa
Parks Quiet Courage Committee that
organized the event, said Parks' ac-
tions were a crucial component of the
civil rights movement.
"Through her simple act of refus-
ing to move from a bus seat, she ignit-
ed flames of justice that could not be
put out," Griner said. "She gave folks
in Montgomery and all over the South
hope and encouragement that one per-
son really can make a difference."
Griner emphasized the program
had a three-fold purpose: to rememberthe day Parks was born, to celebrate
the life she lived and to focus on edu-
cating others about who she was and
what she believed.
A main focus of the event was on
educating youth about an event that
happened more than a half century
ago but is still relevant today, Griner
said.
"She gave folks in Montgom-
ery and all over the South
hope and encouragement
that one person really can
make a difference."
Milford Lewis Griner
chairman and founder of the Rosa
Parks Quiet Courage Committee
He said Parks' actions continue to
inspire him to stand up for his beliefs
every day.
"This means to me that I don't have
to be quiet or stand back in the face
of apparent racism," Griner said. "I
have the freedom to stand up against
inequality because I am a citizen of
America."
Local Toyota dealership responds to gas pedal recall
More than 7.6 million models were faulty Meanwhile, other Gainesville come to the garage complainin
mechanics who will not be in- of gas pedal problems.
By MINCH MINCHIN
Alligator Contributing Writer
The local pace of an interna-
tional Toyota recall seems to be
stuck in the slow lane.
The recall, which was made to
fix faulty gas pedals in more than
7.6 million Toyota models made
in the last six years, has come as a
surprise to local Toyota owners.
"I don't think it's a big deal,"said Gene Branch, a retired grocer
who recently bought a 2009 Tun-
dra pickup truck from Gatorland
Toyota in Gainesville. "I haven't
had any problems at all."
Service personnel at Gatorland
Toyota, who repair about 2,500
cars each month, have not heard
any recent complaints about the
recall, said Robert Hurlbert, Ga-
torland Toyota service and parts
director."I'm certain there are some
[problems], though," he said.
However, since the announce-
ment of the recall, Hurlbert has
tried to reassure
National Toyota customers
News they will be prop-
erly taken care of.
"My biggest job right now is
preparing the staff to deal with
the massive influx of jobs we're
going to be having," he said.volved replacing pedals and mats
are left wondering what the fuss
is all about.
"There have always been
problems with vehicles just like
this, but you never heard nothing
about it," said J.L. Tyson, owner
of JL's Auto Repair in Gainesville
and a Toyota owner. "It's blown
out of proportion."
As far back as Tyson can re-
member, no Toyota owners haveThe large amount of attention
put on Toyota in the last week
may not be a conspiracy, he said,
though he estimated the situation
was certainly political.
"Some are just jealous because
Toyota's always made a good ve-
hicle," Tyson said.
Those affected by the recall
should bring their cars to Gator-
land Toyota, located at 2985 N
Main St.

country?"
He also touched on the necessity of separat-
ing opinions from the law.
Thomas, who has been labeled as one of
the more conservative justices on the Supreme
Court, said he does not let his personal views
interfere with his interpretation of the law.
"I'm not into worshipping methodology,"
he said. "It's our Constitution. It's not mine to
play around with."
Thomas spent most of the discussion talking
about judicial affairs, even comparing judicial
compromise to his ability to compromise with
his wife.
"I like a lot of action movies," Thomas said.
"She likes a lot of romantic comedies. I watch

Happy Friday, Gators.
We're suspecting a lot of you just got your first test grades
back and are contemplating changing your majors to family,
youth and community sciences.
But no matter what happens in your lives, you can always
count on the Editorial Board to deliver your weekly dose of
they-might-make-you-rip-your-paper-in-half-but-we-know-
you-love-us edition of
Darts & Laurels
The Editorial Board has a bone to pick with a certain ro-
dent. That's right, we're talking to you, Punxsutawney Phil.
And your cute, little face and furry features aren't going to
distract us.
You clearly didn't read our editorial the other day, which
offends us a little but not as much as the fact that you gave us
six more weeks of winter.
That's why we have part of the Editorial Board on the look-
out for PETA -so the other part can chuck a big ole DART at
Punxsutawney Phil for seeing his shadow.
And while we're on the subject of individuals we wish
would get underground and stay there, the Editorial Board
would like to publish a book of DARTS, use PAC money to
buy a million copies of it and give one to Sarah Palin for wast-
ing $63,000 buying her own book and another $8,000 on "Go-
ing Rogue" bookmarks.
We don't know about you, but we definitely don't want a
bookmark with Sarah's face on it. But we guess if you donated
money to Sarah Palin, you probably deserve to have it wasted
on ridiculous garbage.
Speaking of ridiculous, this next dart is for all you disil-
lusioned people out there who actually think you look like
David Beckham and Angelina Jolie. We hate to break it to you
(who are we kidding? -no we don't), but 98 percent of you
have little to no resemblance to that hottie in your profile pic-
ture.
And that's why we're sending out the tanks to shoot an
army of big fat DARTS filled with common sense at all you
ridiculous doppelg~inger-wannabes out there -the fact that
you have a twin sister does not mean you look like an Olsen
twin.
On the other hand, we'd like to shower a handful of thanks-
for-keeping-it-funny LAURELS at the ladies who made your
defaults John Stamos, guys who posted Johnny Bravo and
anyone who posted Janet Reno.
And while we're on the subject of Facebook, the Editorial
Board would like to wish everyone's favorite networking site
a happy birthday.
That's right, Facebook turned 6 years old Thursday.
So for bringing us all together -old friends, parents, fu-
ture employers and that guy in the back of the class you have
a crush on -we're going to present creator Mark Zuckerberg
with a cake decorated with LAURELS.
We hope you can stick around for many years to come.
We also wished Conan O'Brien would stick around, but we
didn't get what we wanted.
Nonetheless, we're giving a bright red LAUREL to Coco
for paying each of the 50 crew members from his show sev-
erance pay out of pocket. Whether you were Team Coco or
Team Leno, you have to admit it was a nice move.
So have we done enough this week to piss you off? If so,
write about it in a Letter to the Editor.
If not, see you next week for another edition of Darts and
Laurels.
Until then, take down that stupid picture of pre-baby Jen-
nifer Lopez. Seriously, we re all laughing at you.

Modern Tea Party is deeply flawed
don't understand the Tea Party. I'll admit that I've spentthe past day trying to research what they want on the In-
ternet, and the only thing I can come up with is they just
don't want to pay taxes. I can understand the frustration. I
hate when I go to Publix to buy a newspaper and I have to
pay an extra 6 or 7 cents in sales tax. But that's mostly be-
cause I just don't feel like getting that much change.
There are a few specific things about the Tea Party move-
ment I can't wrap my head around -one being the ques-
tion of why all this is happening now. There's utter hatred
of President Obama from conservatives in the U.S., and I feel
like the Tea Party movement is simply the manifestation of
such hatred. This is evidenced by the fact that while the Re-
publican government under President George W. Bush took
our taxes and spent them on two imbecilic (at best) and il-
legal (at worst) wars, there were no Tea Party protests. Tea
Party members maintain they weren't happy with govern-
ment spending under the Republicans, but they didn't pro-
test. Not until there was a Democratic president.
Another thing I don't understand is what the Tea Partiers
propose we should have done to get out of the recession -
other than the opposite of what the federal government did.
Instead of letting the banking industry crumble, whichwould
lead to further economic turmoil, the government (Demo-
crats and Republicans) decided to do whatever it could to
bring the country back from the brink of a second depres-
sion. The same thing happened with the auto industry.
I understand the frustrations surrounding these two deci-
sions because they frustrated me, as well, but I can also see
why the government did what it did. When top economic
advisers are telling the leaders of the country to do some-
thing to help jump-start the economy, we should follow their
advice and do whatever we can. However, there should be
stipulations put in place to prevent such an event from hap-
pening again. Looking at the situation from the outside, it
seems the government actually handled itself very well be-
cause the economy is well on its way to recovery.4-
Paul Murty
letters@alligator orgThis brings me to the issue of taxes.
Tea Partiers don't want to pay taxes, or
at least they don't want to pay higher
taxes. The most baffling thing, to me,
is that President Obama has actually
cut taxes for 95 percent of Americans
since he's been in office. Although it's
not much, Americans have been taxed
less and have received money back
from the government. It seems to me
the time for these anti-tax rallies would have been during
Bush's presidency, when taxes were cut for the wealthy but
stayed relatively the same for the middle and lower classes.
At least the money the government collects from its people is
being spent on things inside the country now, since we will
soon be out of Iraq and Afghanistan for good, and we won't
have to spend more money over there.
Finally, I see some inherent wrongs with the Tea Party as
a whole. I assume the Tea Party patriots have to travel to their
conventions and rallies by driving. Do they advocate the use
of taxes to repair the roads they use? How about the public
education system? Should it be privatized, forcing families
to pay through the nose for elementary and high schools?
Are all government programs bad or just the ones that are
outside your district, or ones Democrats support? And how
about the Tea Party convention this week? Would the $549
per person not be better spent helping out someone in Haiti
or helping out a lower-income family? But I better watch my-
self. My want to help the downtrodden is sounding pretty
Socialist right about now.
The original Tea Party was an act of frustration against
the British government for taxing the colonies without allow-
ing them to represent themselves in Parliament. The current
Tea Party just seems to be an act of frustration against the
Democrat-controlled American government.

SG needs real reform
If undergrads ever want
to see a change in Student
Government, it isn't going to
come through a self-defeating,
lawsuit-happy "Indy" party
that does nothing but whine in
Senate chambers and does ri-
diculous stunts on election day.
And it isn't going to come from
the party that acts as a mouth-
piece for the administration.
What needs to happen is real
electoral reform. Students need
to be represented and partici-
pate in the system -not decide
between which party is worse,
which is nearly impossible at
this point.

MENSuper Bowl commercial
should not be prejudged
I am writing to express my
full support for the Tebow family
ad that is expected to air during
the Super Bowl. I am outraged at
women groups such as N.O.W.
for denouncing and condemning
the 30 second ad before they even
get to see it. From what I gather
regarding the ad, it will discuss
Pam Tebow's courageous deci-
sion and story to have Tim. Why
is the ad vilified as anti-abortion
simply because it has a pro-life
message? I do not believe for a
moment that either Tim or his
mother will be chastising others
for their opposing views during
the commercial. Tim Tebow has
been a model student, athlete,
humanitarian, and young man.
Those that differ with his pro-life
position should in no way call
into question his integrity and
passion.

Walker's late layup leads UF to road win
* DAN WERNER MADE A
HEADS-UP PLAY TO CLINCH
VICTORY.
By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
aberry@alligator org
TUSCALOOSA, Ala. -Flor-
ida's game-winning play came
on a floater that Billy Donovan
thought "rolled around the rim
forever," but the game-saving
play came seconds later from
a player who scored no points
Thursday night.
Sophomore point guard Erv-
ing Walker put the Gators ahead
with 11 seconds left, and senior
forward Dan Werner knocked
away an inbounds pass in the fi-
nal seconds to give UF a 66-65
win against Alabama in Coleman
Coliseum.
Walker, who finished with 16
points, drove past Alabama guard
Anthony Brock and put up a shot
that hit seemingly every part of
the rim before falling and giving
the Gators (16-6, 5-3 Southeastern
Conference) a one-point lead over
the Crimson Tide (13-9, 3-5 SEC).
"Brock was playing good de-
fense on me throughout the game,
but I knew I could get by him,"
Walker said. "I just had to go to
the hole strong. I had open floor,
just me and him, and I was able to
get by him."With a lead secured, UF could
only avoid a two-game losing
streak by stopping Alabama in
the final 11 seconds. Junior power
forward Alex Tyus, who scored
a team-high 19 points, blocked
Mikhail Torrance's runner out of
bounds to set up the final play of
the game with just over three sec-
onds remaining.
Alabama freshmanTonyMitch-
ell took the ball out of bounds and
attempted to lob it into the lane
to forward JaMychal Green, but
Werner slammed the ball all the
way to the other side of the court,
letting time expire as the Tide
desperately chased after it.
Werner scored zero points,
but his teammates and Donovan
praised the senior's awareness on
the final play.
"Dan's smart," Walker said.
"He's been here for a long time.
He knows all the tricks. That was
a really heady play."
Donovan said the inbounds
play was not one Alabama coach
Anthony Grant had used before,
which made preparing his team
for the play during the timeout far
more difficult.
Grant, a longtime assistant
under Donovan, said the play he
drew up in the huddle wasn't
good enough, and he didn't think
he would sleep Thursday night
given the way it turned out.
"That one's on me," Grant said.
SEE HOOPS, PAGE 15Harrison Diamond/ Alligator Staff
UF guard Erving Walker struggled in the first half, scoring
just two points, but rebounded to finish with 16.

very once in a while I allow myselfto get lost in the feel-good "ama-
teurism" of college sports.
It just warms my heart to see thousands
of students cheer for their peers on game-

degrees they never could've earned with-

erwise known as the NCAA.
Amid my dreams of sunshine and rain-

cloudy skies of reality.

it difficult to simply roll over and fall back

I've been listening
to a lot of Lil' Wayne
lately, and the NCAA

"If it ain't broke, don't break it."
The college basketball postseason for-
mat is hands down the most perfect of any
sport in the country, amateur or profes-
sional.
As a result, it's also the most popular
among viewers, which means the NCAA
and big-time television companies areseeking a way to make an extra buck or
two -or one million -by adding more
games to the slate. Companies like CBS,
ESPN and Fox are expected to be involved
in the bidding war.
A 96-team field would add a total of
31 games to the Tournament slate, which
equals a substantial amount of additional
TV revenue and a bigger contract for the
NCAA.
Even Florida coach Billy Donovan said
this week he is in favor of expanding the
field.

One day after signing one
of the best defensive recruiting
classes in recent memory, Florida
lost its defensive coordinator for
the second time in a month.
George Edwards, who was
hired on Jan. 8 to be UF's new
defensive coordinator after the
departure of Charlie Strong, ac-
cepted the same position with
the Buffalo Bills on Thursday, ac-
cording to ESPN.
New Bills coach Chan Gailey
worked with Edwards when he
was the head coach in Dallas al-
most a decade
ago.- Edwards
coached the
line backers
there and with
the Miami
Dolphins be-
Edwards fore coming to
Gainesville for
roughly a month.
The Gators will begin the
search for a new defensive co-
ordinator and could hire from
within the program.
Safeties coach and co-defen-
sive coordinator Chuck Heater
expressed interest in the position
before Edwards filled the job fol-
lowing UF's Sugar Bowl win.
"I'm interested in having a
leadership role, whatever that
might be," Heater said on Dec.
28. "But I don't have tobe entitled
or anything. I just want to be in a
good room with a good exchange
of ideas with good guys."
Defensive line coach Dan Mc-
Carney has also been mentioned
as a possible candidate, thoughhe
told media members that he was
not interested in the increased re-
sponsibility on Dec. 28.

Gators struggle shooting in loss to Commodores
By EUGENIO TORRENS
Alligator Writer
etorrens@a IIigator org
The Gators thought they had
found their shooting stroke, but in-
stead found frustration and missed
shots Thursday.
UF (12-10, 5-4 Southeastern
Conference) dropped its home
game against Vanderbilt (17-6, 6-4
SEC) 66-58.
Florida failed to sustain its hot
shooting from the Ole Miss victo-
ry, when the team shot 48 percent
from the field and 52.4 percent be-
hind the three-point line. Instead,the Gators shot 41.5 percent from
the field, but struggled from be-
yond the arc at a 23.5-percent clip.
"From the tip, Vanderbilt set
the tone," coach Amanda Butler
said. "We adjusted to the tone that
they set, and we're just not very
good that way."
Despite a size advantage and
outrebounding the Commodores
36-28, both teams tied with 32
points in the paint.
"We did a good job on the
boards, but that's pretty much
where it ended in terms of the
positives about our performance,"
Butler said. "I don't think we hadan effort problem tonight."
Azania Stewart and Sharielle
Smith finished with a team-high 13
points each, while Jennifer George
Sorensenand Steffi Sorens-
en followed with
nine a piece.
Stewart, Smith
and George -all
post players 
-
combined for a
68-percent effort
from the floor.
Aside from Sorensen, who hit
two of her three three-pointers in
the first half, the bulk of Florida's
first-half scoring came from thefrontcourt with Stewart, George
and Smith totaling 18 of the Gators'
26 points.
The Commodores got scoring
from their whole lineup. Seven of
eight players who played scored
in the first half, with Jence Rhoads
leading the way with eight points.
She finished with 14 and teammate
Lauren Lueders had 13 and seven
rebounds.
UF had trouble communicating
on the offensive end and commit-
ted 11 turnovers in the first half
and finished with 18, while the
Commodores had 13.
The Gators also had problemsfrom the free-throw line. They shot
55.6 percent, but only hit 2 of 6 in
the first half, while Vanderbilt fin-
ished 9 of 12 at the line.
"The shots that are more con-
cerning to me are not necessarily
the missed threes, as the missed
free throws," Butler said. "That's
not something that has been a
weakness for us, it's something
we've been able to do consistently
well."
Florida will look to bounce
back hosting Mississippi State on
Sunday. Florida snagged a 55-52
road win against the Bulldogs on
Jan. 17.
Parsons sees tin
HOOPS, from page 13
"I take full blame for that."
The final seconds brought about re-
demption for Walker and Werner, whose
mistakes turned UF's four-point lead with
about a minute to go into a one-point game.
Brock stole the ball from Walker near half-
court and sped down the floor for a fast-
break layup, which he turned into a three-
point play after Werner fouled him.
Walker also struggled to score in the first
half, getting just two points on three shots
in the opening period, but he penetrated
from the wing more after halftime -some-
thing he and freshman guard Kenny Boyn-
ton were able to do with junior forward
Chandler Parsons running the offense.
Donovan said whether Parsons playsme at point guard
more point guard the rest of the season will
depend on how much pressure opponents
put on Walker.
"When a guy's playing (36) minutes and
he's his size, to be under that type of du-
ress every single possession -we've got to
find a way to relieve him
a little bit," Donovan said
of Walker.
Men's The Gators won't have
Basketball much time to savor the
win, as UF will match up
with Mississippi State (16-
6, 4-3 SEC) at 1:30 p.m. on Saturday in the
O'Connell Center.
"Everybody knows the goal is to make
the NCAA Tournament," Walker said. "If
we're going to do that, we've got to get
these types of wins."KYLE, from page 13
to add? I don't know all that. But I
think every college coach would be
the same way."
No disrespect to Donovan, but
every college coach also wants to
have a better chance of getting his
team into the Tournament and keep-
ing his job.
Without question, the biggest
slap in the face is delivered firmly to
the collective cheek of college bas-
ketball fans.
For years, college football fans,
analysts and coaches have pleaded
with the NCAA to fix the disgrace-fully inefficient BCS.
Behind the guise of academic in-
tegrity and complicated logistics, the
BCS has remained in place for the
exact same reason the powers that
be are more than happy to change a
perfect system.
"The money is the motive," Lil'
Wayne wheezes on the same song.
The college football bowl spon-
sors and college basketball TV net-
works couldn't care less about de-
termining a true champion in the
fairest way possible.
The darkest cloud of all: I'm be-
ginning to think neither does the
NCAA.

UF will test new routines
By TOM GREEN
Alligator Writer
Coming off of her team's best perfor-
mance of the season, UF coach Rhonda
Faehn wants to see if a different lineup
could improve on that score.
Faehn plans to use the No. 3 Gators'
meet at No. 22 N.C. State tonight as an op-
portunity to switch things up, all in hopes
of getting a higher team total.
Florida (3-1, 3-0 Southeastern Confer-
ence) will be trying out a few new routines
as well as changing some existing ones.
Among the possible changes, senior
Courtney Gladys may perform a more dif-
ficult first pass in her floor exercise.
"It's something she has originally want-
ed to do all fall, and we just didn't use it
in competition," Faehn said. "But if she
warms up well, we may give her the op-
portunity to get out there and go for it."
One of the new changes the team will
use this week is a bar combination by
sophomore Elizabeth Mahlich, who scored
a team-low 9.775 against LSU on bars.Faehn said she and the other coaches
feel it will help Mahlich score higher.
Standout freshman Ashan6e Dickerson
will also be tweaking her bar routine, and
Marissa King will be carrying out a slightly
different balance beam routine this week.
But new performances won'tbe the only
changes UF will make against N.C. State.
Freshman Randy Stageberg will return to
the lineup on floor and beam after sitting
out the LSU meet with
an illness.
Faehn said she will
use this opportunityGymnastics near the midpoint of
the season to rest some
gymnasts, including
senior Maranda Smith on floor exercise.
"We're treating each athlete as an indi-
vidual, according to their bodies and their
needs to determine whether or not they
can go for us," Faehn said.
The meet was originally scheduled as a
tri-meet with George Washington, but the
team dropped out of the competition for
undisclosed reasons.UF TRACK AND FIELD
Gators head to VT for meet
By RYAN BUTLER

Calvin Smith has always been focused
on making himself one of the best sprinters
in the nation. Now he is looking to make
his team one of the best as well.
After his personal-best in a season-
opening race last week, Smith and the No.
5 UF men's and No. 9 women's track and
field teams are looking to continue build-
ing their momentum heading into this
weekend's Virginia Tech Elite Meet, which
begins today at 5 p.m.
"I want to leave with an individual title
and a team title," Smith said. "I feel if I put
my best effort forward, then the team will
too."
Smith, a 13-time All-American, is
among 12 individuals and relay groups on
the men's and women's teams to already
qualify for the NCAA Indoor Champion-
ship.
The senior attributed his NCAA quali-
fying mark of 46:48 in the 400-meter dash
last weekend to increased motivation for
his last season as a Gator.
"Because it's my senior year I'm not sure
if I'll ever run again so I'm pushing myself
harder," Smith said. "The freshmen arelooking to me so they know what to do."
This weekend in Blacksburg, Va., he'll
look to add a qualify in the 200-meter
dash.
He's also a part of one of the elite 4x400
relay teams in the nation, which will com-
pete against some of the best teams in the
Atlantic Coastal Conference and South-
eastern Conference, including in-state rival
FSU.
Smith is not the only one who will be
looking to qualify for the
NCAA Championships
this weekend.
Christian Taylor,
the anchor of the 4x400
team, will try to qualify
individually in the triple
jump.
Smith Taylor, the defend-
ing national champion
in the triple jump will compete in the event
for the first time this season in this week-
end's meet.
The sophomore said he's treating this
meet like a post-season competition.
"You don't have to wait to the SECs to
do something big. When you perform at a
high level (in regular-season meets) it gets
easier at the big meets," Taylor said.
