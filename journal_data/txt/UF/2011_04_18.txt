NEW YORK — A New York City woman 
who was getting $850 a month in alimony 
because she was supposedly disabled and unable to work had her payments slashed after her ex-husband spotted online photos of her belly dancing.
Brian McGurk went to court after dis-
covering a blog that showed his 43-year-old ex-wife dancing at a gallery.
In other Internet postings, she wrote 
about dancing vigorously for several hours every day.
Dorothy McGurk told the court that the 
dancing was physical therapy for injuries she suffered in a car accident in the mid-1990s.
A county judge didn’t buy it — and re-
duced her payments to $400 per month.
The judge also ordered her to pay her 
ex-husband’s legal fees and 60 percent from the sale of their home.

UF students may be happy to hear 
that their tuition won’t greatly increase 
this fall, but it may mean cuts to academ -
ic programs and employee benefits.
In Thursday’s Faculty Senate meet-
ing, UF President Bernie Machen said 
his proposed 30 percent tuition increase would be a far stretch to get by state leg-islators. 
“I haven’t given up,” he said, “but I’d 
say it’s a Hail Mary at this point.”
Machen’s proposal would be a one-
time 30 percent increase that would help UF keep core programs and benefits for employees. It was suggested to counter -
act the budget cuts proposed by Gov. Rick Scott.The possible increase would raise in-
state tuition at UF from $5,000 to $6,500 a year.
Even after the increase, tuition would 
still be lower than the national average of about $7,600, according to CollegeBoard.
com. 
The state allows 
universities to increase tuition up to 15 percent a year. 
For UF, that would 
be $750 more for tu-ition per semester.
Machen said the 15 
percent increase might cover the pro-posed $17.5 million cut to faculty ben-efits at UF, but it won’t cover the base budget that is also proposed to be cut by legislation.

E.T. York, the founder of UF’s Institute 
of Food and Agricultural Sciences and life-
long supporter of agriculture education, died Friday. He was 88.
York, who also served as executive vice president and interim president at UF as well as the chancellor emeritus of the State 
University System,  was best known for creating the institute in 1964 and devel-
oping it into a nationally recognized pro-gram. 
He went on to be an adviser on agricul-
tural issues for six presidents and the chair 
of the federal Board for International Food 
and Agricultural Development.
“E.T. embodied the ideas of service, loyalty and generosity,” UF President Ber -
nie Machen said in a statement. “He was 
an absolute giant of a man in every sense, 
and we will all miss 
him terribly.” 
York was born in 
Alabama and grew 
up during the Great Depression. He re-
ceived a bachelor’s degree in agriculture 
sciences from Alabama Polytechnic Insti-tute, now known as Auburn University, served in the Army during World War II and returned to Auburn University to get 
a master’s degree.
He is survived by his wife of 64 years, 
Vermelle, whom he met while he was a 
graduate student. 
He also is survived by his daughter, 
Lisa, and his son, Travis.
Funeral services will be for family, per 
his request. A public memorial will be scheduled at a later date. Former VP, IFAS founder York dies at 88

Armed with a green Tupperware bin 
bearing his name, Bob Nudelman showed 
up at a book sale a day early.
Traveling from Chester, Va., he  
wouldn’t say exactly how long he’d been 
there because he didn’t want his competi-tion to find out.
Saturday was the first day of the five-
day-long sale, and hundreds of dealers, bookworms and penny-pinching students alike lined up hours before the sale opened 
at 430-B N. Main St.
“This is probably one of the top 10 to 
15 sales in the country ,” said Nudelman, a book dealer. “It’s the best sale in Florida.”
At 9 a.m., book sale staff opened the 
doors to customers. Those in the block-
long line power-walked past a police offi-cer into the warehouse.
Inside, the building smelled of old books 
with a tang of cement dust, but shoppers 
didn’t have time to stop and smell.
It’s all about speed, said Emily Rodri-
guez, a 28-year-old Gainesville resident.Book sale offers stealsUFAdministration

U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio visited 
his alma mater Saturday, joining 
UF students and alumni for the 
Florida Blue Key banquet and in-
duction ceremony. 
Rubio, a UF graduate who de-
feated former Florida Gov. Charlie 
Crist and former U.S. Rep. Ken-
drick Meek in November for the Senate seat, gave the banquet’s 
keynote speech to an audience that included UF President Bernie Machen, former Florida Chief Fi-
nancial Officer Alex Sink and UF Student Body President Ashton 
Charles.
During his speech, Rubio cited 
the national debt as a central threat 
to America and called for an end 
to crisis-oriented government in Washington, D.C. 
“We can’t lurch from one crisis 
to the other,” he said in an inter -
view before the banquet. “We’ve got to figure out a way to get ahead of the issues before the issues get ahead of us.”
Rubio said the United States dis-
tinguishes itself 
from other na-tions not through its government 
but through its people. America, 
he said, is a na-tion of citizens 
who come from many back-
grounds but are all “descendants 
of go-getters.”
“If tomorrow America decided we want to be just like everyone else — who takes America’s place?” 
he said. “There is no one waiting in line to be who we have been.” 
The 64 Florida Blue Key induct-
ees, including UF basketball player Chandler Parsons, were then of-ficially welcomed into the organi-
zation, which  is the university’s oldest honor and service society. 
According to Florida Blue Key President Craig Thompson, the or -
ganization has about 160 student 
members.
For many in the audience, the banquet was the first opportunity they had to hear Rubio speak, he 
said.
“He’s a die-hard Gator and 
loves the University of Florida,” 
Thompson said of the senator. 
Kiel Green, a UF junior who 
was inducted into Florida Blue Key Saturday, said that while Rubio’s speech was more political than he 
expected, it included ideas that people needed to hear. 
“It’s nice to have [our] service to 
the University of Florida reward-
ed,” he said.Rubio talks government reform at induction ceremony

April 18, 1971: About 400 students gather on 
the Plaza of the Americas to symbolically bury the living UF President Stephen C. O’Connell.
The demonstration was in reaction to the 
arrest of 67 black students a few days earlier 
as they protested at the president’s office and 
demanded his immediate resignation in the face of what they believed to be a racist and problematic university power structure.
The students then march to his house to 
present his wife with a wreath of lilies.
April 18, 1979: In the face of financial uncer -
tainty the University Athletic Association 
votes to drop wrestling and women’s volley-
ball.
Dropping the programs will save the uni-versity $130,000, and all athletic scholarships for those involved will be discontinued. It’s estimated 75 percent of the athletes will trans-fer to other school because of the cuts. The women’s team will return in 1984.
April 20, 1982: A public relations class breaks 
a Guinness Book World Record by building a 
leather wallet that was 3 feet by 5 feet with the intent of presenting it to President Reagan.
“We want Gov. [Bob] Graham to bring the 
wallet with him to Washington when he tries to get federal funds for the state of Florida,” said UF student Richard Widick, a member of 
the class attempting the project.

The skies of Alachua were predict-
ed to rain with Easter eggs, but 15 mph 
winds changed the forecast.
About 2,000 people gathered for 
Egg Drop Alachua on Saturday at the future location of Christ Central Ala-chua church, located on Cellon Creek Boulevard, where plastic eggs were scheduled to drop from a hot-air bal-loon for children to find along with 10,000 eggs already scattered on the ground. 
But there was one problem: The 
hot-air balloon couldn’t fly in 15 mph winds.
After 40 minutes of attempting to get the balloon in the air, Mark Johns, lead pastor of Christ Central Alachua, improvised by starting a countdown himself, and the hunt began.
It took the children 15 minutes to 
find all the eggs.
Though the egg drop didn’t go as 
planned, the event had different activ-
ity stations for the chil-
dren such as face paint-
ing and bounce houses. 
The Easter bunny even 
made an early visit.
Johns said he wanted to provide 
a safe, fun and entertaining environ-ment for families to spend their Satur -
day afternoon.
Johns said he  hopes to drop the 
eggs from helicopters next year.Weather delays egg hunt

n THE BIODEGRADABLE 
BALLS CAN BE USED ON CRUISE SHIPS.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
Lobsters aren’t just for eating 
anymore.
The shells from Maine’s signa-
ture seafood are being used to man-
ufacture decorative tiles, trivets and 
drinking-glass coasters. Work is 
under way to utilize them in coun-tertops and tabletops. And at the University of Maine, a professor has developed prototypes of biodegrad-able golf balls and plant pots made out of ground-up lobster shells.
“Instead of dumping the shells 
at landfills, the idea is to add value 
to the product, which hopefully 
will funnel back into the industry ,” said David Neivandt, a professor of chemical and biological engineer -
ing who created a biodegradable golf ball with a core made of lobster shells.
Lobster processors dispose of 
tons of lobster shells that are left 
over after the meat is removed. In-dustry leaders have long wondered 
if there might be a way to make money from the part being thrown away.
Neivandt and one of his stu-
dents, Alex Caddell, together de-veloped a golf ball using ground-up lobster shells mixed with a glue-like 
substance for its core. 
The shell is also made out of nat-
urally derived biodegradable mate-
rial, but they aren’t giving specifics because they don’t want to give away any secrets. 
The ball is the same size and 
weight as a standard golf ball but is intended for use on cruise ships or 
at driving ranges that are on lakes 
or the ocean.
Dumping golf balls into the sea 
is prohibited under international convention because they are made of plastic and don’t break down, but the lobster golf ball is biodegradable and disintegrates in the water in about three weeks.
Caddell, who played golf in high 
school, said he and Neivandt tested numerous balls that cracked, didn’t fly quite right or otherwise didn’t make the cut. Finally , they came upon just the 
right mixture that makes the ball hit nearly like the real thing.
“The first time I hit it, I was sur -
prised it didn’t shatter into a million pieces,” Caddell said. “And it flew straight. I usually have a pretty bad slice, so to hit it straight was amaz-
ing.”
With an iron, the ball flies nearly 
the same distance as a standard ball. 
With a driver, it’ll go 60 to 70 per -
cent of the distance.
There are other biodegradable 
golf balls on the market, which sell for about $1 each, 
Neivandt said. The 
raw materials for the lobster golf 
ball cost about 19 cents per ball, which could make it competitive in the open market.
The university has filed a pro-
visional patent for the lobster-shell mixture. Neivandt said a private company could buy the licensing 
rights and market the ball, or the 
school could spin off a company that would produce it.
While developing the golf ball, 
they also came up with a plant pot made out of lobster shell mixture, which has a high calcium content beneficial to flowers and vegetables, to place directly in the ground with flowers or vegetable plants.
Turning seafood waste products  
such as lobster or clam shells into products with commercial value 
would benefit the seafood industry , 
said Bob Bayer, head of The Lobster Institute Research and Education organization at the University of Maine.
Most lobster shells are dumped 
in the garbage or at landfills, Bayer said, with some of it going toward seafood compost used for gardens 
or turned into lobster meal, which is 
an animal feed additive. 
There have been failed efforts to 
turn the shells into other marketable products, such as lobster bait, over the years, so Bayer is pleased to see new products come on line.
“The whole idea is to add value 
to our lobster,” he said. “The more 
value we can extract, the more fish-
ermen will be paid and more jobs will be created.”
EcoSeaTile LLC, a small com-
pany based in Mount Desert, for the past year has been making tiles of reclaimed lobster, mussel, clam, oyster and scallop shells for use in homes and businesses, selling at dozens of high-end tile shops in New England and New York. It re-cently added a line of drinking-glass coasters that are sold at gift shops.
Owner Mickey Shattow said 
the tiles seem to be most popular among customers who live on or near the ocean.
Aron Buterbaugh is making triv-
ets in the shape of lobster claws, made of lobster shells and recycled glass, among the products at his Beachstone, Inc., a company he runs 
out of South Portland.
He’s also working on developing 
vanities, bathroom countertops, tile 
accessories and tabletops for patio furniture, coffee tables for the home and restaurant dining room tables that utilize shells from mussels, clams, oysters, scallops and lobsters in combination with recycled glass, 
he said.
“They’re plentiful. They’re a 
waste product. They’re decorative,” 
he said. “It’s a win-win-win strategy in my opinion.”

Borders closed its doors for 
the final time  Sunday after 
purging almost its entire in-ventory, including furniture.  
Dozens of customers searched through the leftover books, maga-
zines and CDs left in the store, 
6837 W. Newberry Road, while others left with bookshelves. 
Most books were sold for less 
than $5.
“Chords of Strength: A Mem-
oir of Soul, Song and the Power of Perseverance” by David Archu-leta was one of the last books on the shelves. 
“It’s really sad the store 
is gone,” said Nandy Fergu-
son, the general store man-
ager of the Florida Book Store.  
The store’s 26 employees are now out of a job, including Ferguson’s 
husband, Brian. He was Borders’ inventory manager for five years.
She said he became close friends 
with his co-workers, which is an-other reason he will miss his job. 
UF English major Alexandra 
Murnaghan went to the store two nights before it closed. Inside, it 
was silent. People tiptoed in be-
tween bookcases and whispered to their friends. Customers glared 
at a man who sneezed, as if the 
noise bothered them. 
“I felt like I was in a library,” 
she said. “It was very eerie.” 
The store is one of 200 within 
the Ann Arbor, Mich.,-based com-
pany to close due to lack of sales. The business filed for Chapter 11 reorganization in February. 
The Gainesville branch opened 
in November 1999 but was placed 
on Borders’ list of “underperform-
ing stores.” 
Its closure was announced Feb. 
16, and the location had closeout 
sales since then. The store recent-
ly had signs in the windows an-nouncing 80 to 90 percent off the store’s inventory. 
David Denslow, a UF econom-
ics professor, said the increase of 
sales in electronic books on iP-
ads and Nooks contributed to the 
store’s downfall.
The ebook of the New York 
Times bestseller, “Water for El-
ephants,” is $4.17 on Amazon. Amazon’s hardcover edition is $16.29. 
The large paperback version is 
sold for $14.95 at Borders stores

The Borders book store at 6837 W. Newberry Road sits empty after its last weekend of business. The com-
pany filed for bankruptcy in February and is closing about 200 stores to make the company profitable.
The sale, held twice a year, usually brings in about $150,000
“I’m in heaven,” she said as she put a $3, unopened Led 
Zeppelin record in her box. “We’re all taking advantage of 
these prices, which you won’t find ever.”
Pete Roode, president of Friends of the Library , said their 
patronage will be worth more than the shoppers know. 
He said the only money the Friends of the Library spends 
from the proceeds is what’s needed to pay the warehouse elec-tricity bills. Everything else goes to the Alachua County Li-brary District to buy books. He said the sale consistently brings in about $150,000 twice a year.
Saturday brought in $91,700 from thousands of shoppers, 
and he said that’s especially important this year because the state legislature is considering cutting funding for library districts.
“I think it’s more important than in years gone 
by,” Roode said.
A mother with a sleeping baby strapped to her back flipped 
through learning-to-count books.Retired experts-turned-volunteers kept watch over the 
books they know best. And because prices are low, book-lov-ing students come flocking.
“This is ridiculous,” said Melika Hadziomerovic, a UF ju-
nior, as she sorted out what she couldn’t afford. “It’s everything that I want to buy but can’t afford to buy in a big store.”
The sale, she said, is wonderful. So wonderful, in fact, that it 
left the English major at a loss for a fitting metaphor.
But, then again, she had been waiting in line since 6:30 a.m.
“It’s like the highlight of the semester,” she said.FRIENDS , from page 1“It’s really sad the store

Today’s question: Did you attend the Friends of the Library sale?The results for Friday’s question are unavailable due to technical error.Revenue Review
With Tax Day here, we’ve come across news saying taxes 
collected on our nation’s top 400 incomes amount to 10 percentage points less than those collected in 1992. Sounds crazy compared to the average drop of 0.6 per -
centage points, doesn’t it? Well, keep in mind that 45 percent of American house-holds pay no income taxes, according to the Tax Policy Center.
The majority of those not 
paying, and note this doesn’t 
mean they don’t pay payroll, 
state and local taxes, make $50,000 or less each year, but there are five million people making between $50,000 and $1 million who don’t have to worry about the tax man. People in both groups have exemptions and credits to thank, but their days are likely numbered.Both sides of the aisle have 
been discussing ways to gen-
erate revenue through taxa-
tion, whether it be through 
eliminating tax breaks but 
lowering the highest tax rate 
or through forcing the rich 
to pay the same percentage 
the average American does. 
We’re getting ready for a 
long, ugly battle between 
people who agree we need 
more revenue but who dis-
agree on who to take it from. 
We have to give both 
sides a nod for understand-ing the tax system is entirely too complicated as is, but Obama certainly won us over by saying he wanted to create a system where “the 
amount of taxes you pay isn’t 
determined by what kind of 
accountant you can afford.” 
Nicely said, Mr. President. Making that happen, how-ever, is going to be a differ -
ent story.Single Whammy
Thirty-percent tuition 
hike looks unlikely
Although most of the Editorial Board is graduating 
in a few days, we’re happy to hear Bernie Machen’s proposed 30 percent tuition increase is now merely 
a dream, unlikely to come true. 
We want everyone to have the same types of opportu-
nities we’ve had while at UF, and stressing students with financial burdens doesn’t help achieve that end. It seemed 
like our administration was willing to rain down a perfect 
storm of price hikes on students, especially with block tu-ition gaining steam despite student protests.
We could have understood had the proposals been for 
either block tuition or a 30 percent increase, but hitting stu-
dents with both at one time was nonsensical. We’re think-
ing that’s what someone told dear old Bernie to make him understand that although our students’ median household income breaks $100,000 a year, there are many who are 
scrounging for cash and working jobs to fund their educa-
tion.
We’re not out of the woods yet, though. The price of tu-
ition still can increase legally by 15 percent per year until we meet the national average. 
It looks like no matter what we do, attending college is 
going to become more expensive even as Bright Futures dies a slow, painful death. Although we applaud our Ma-chen for coming to his senses, we still have a feeling that 
students aren’t going to like tuition prices increasing, es-
pecially for classes they’re paying for but not taking under the block tuition plan.
What a difference a year can bring
What a difference a year can bring. 
Some years are good. 
Some years are bad. 
Some shoot by in a flash while others seem to drag 
on for an eternity. 
While the jury still is out on the next twelve months, 
the next year is certain to be a memorable one.
Crises at home and abroad still will exist. Record budget shortfalls still will be hanging over 
our heads, and power struggles between the president and Congress still will be playing out in our nation’s capital.
However, all hope is not lost.Patrick Henry said, “I have but one lamp by which 
my feet are guided, and that is the lamp of experience. I know of no way of judging the future but by the past.”
Surely, America’s past has been bright. For most of 
the 20th century, the United States was a light to a dark and hopeless world. 
In addition to twice saving the world from tyranny, 
the U.S. survived, and recovered from, the crash of its 
stock market, the assassination of a president and nu-
merous other tragedies that should have crippled this relatively new nation.
While these uplifting thoughts certainly come to 
mind today, Patrick Henry was offering his words as a cautionary tale against those who would undermine individual liberties protected by a republican system of government.
It was Thomas Jefferson who said, “History has in-
formed us that bodies of men as well as individuals are susceptible to the spirit of tyranny.”
During these times of heightened national security and record budget shortfalls, all Americans must be mindful of these words.
Fortunately, there is no rea-
son America’s future cannot be as bright as its past. 
Many experts often say the first 
and hardest step on the road to re-covery is recognizing a problem ex-
ists. As a nation, we have done this and are beginning to discuss the next steps necessary to treat our current financial condition.
The problem, though, is that many of the remedies 
currently being discussed are merely superficial fixes — remedies akin to only lifting one’s foot off the ac-celerator of a speeding car rather than wholeheartedly 
applying the brakes when confronted with the possibil-
ity of a crash.
U.S. domestic security, national security and ulti-
mately its protection of individual liberties at home and abroad depend on our ability to place our nation on a 
sound financial footing.
As both Patrick Henry and Thomas Jefferson im-
plied, much can be learned from history. History has 
seen many great nations rise but unfortunately fall from 
their own internal failings.
The United States is at a crossroads. 
We can join these other nations that have fallen by 
the wayside, or we can reform and continue to show the world what can be rather than being remembered 
merely  for what once was.

Letters to the Editor
Government regulation not conservative
In response to Bob Minchin’s column on 
Friday, I find it surprising that one who is ap-
palled by intrusive government agencies and overbearing regulation believes government intrusion and regulation is necessary in the 
case of unwanted pregnancy. I guess I was 
wrong to assume a “true conservative” is actu-ally conservative and not just a shill parroting the Republican party line. 
Chad Kimes

Conservatives can’t have it both ways
Bob Minchin mentions that any true con-
servative is appalled by intrusive agencies and overbearing regulations. He then proceeds to completely contradict those principles as he talks about regulating abortion. A government 
telling a woman what to do with her body is 
not only intrusive and overbearing but also degrading. Comparing abortion to genocide 
is offensive toward all people who have lived 
through an actual genocide. 
It is not right to “punish” a girl for having 
sex by forcing her to have a baby and then pay to raise it. Conservatives will fight for that fe-tus until it is actually born and then refuse to give it welfare. 
Conservatives, make up your mind. Will it 
be an overbearing and intrusive government 
that regulates everything, or will people be al-lowed their individual rights and liberties?

Abortion the civil rights issue of the day
I would like to say thank you to Bob 
Minchin for sharing his views in Friday’s col-
umn “Abortion stance key to conservatism.” His extremely well-written dialogue not only exposes the shallow and inhumane actions of 
the “pro-choice” movement but also calls con-
servatives to act with passion and conviction.
He has inspired me to do more to make a 
difference in the civil rights issue of our gen-eration.

Women face undue burden in child care 
What is with the Bob Minchin column 
published on Friday? It’s like he doesn’t even try to understand what these women are going through. I will admit I am against abortions, but I at least try to understand 
why someone would do such a thing. How 
is a woman supposed to take care of a child if she gets paid a lower salary than a man? How is she supposed to take care of a child if child care costs are ridiculous? There are no American laws that give nursing women a break.
Everything is about some absurd idea 
that people are on their own and shouldn’t 
receive help when they desperately need it.
Yes, abortions disrespect the sanctity of 
life, but at least they make it easier for wom-
en, especially single mothers, to take care of their children. 
Take Europe, for example, where women 
are given two months after giving birth to recuperate and are given adequate child care assistance by law. The foster care system in 
America is so lacking that most of the chil-
dren in there aren’t going to college to get an education. So if you are going to say no to abortions, at least make that choice an easier one. Yes, society is on a moral decline, but that shouldn’t justify being cruel and deny-ing aid to those who make mistakes.

LGBT community only wants equality 
After reading the replies to Megan Bis-
sell’s letter, published April 13, regarding Chick-fil-A’s support of anti-gay organi-zations, I must say that I too am an angry lesbian. The point both Andrew Robb and 
Ryan Galloway seemed to miss is that the 
university allows a corporation to profit off a Student Body that it oppresses. A business is entitled to its “moral” convictions just as 
much as anyone else. However, these ideals 
are not consistent with the inclusive and ac-cepting values UF espouses. It is extremely unsettling to know that my school, which insists upon cultivating a diverse student culture, continues to involve itself with a corporation that blatantly perpetuates discrimination and hate against me. UF’s seemingly indifferent attitude in regard to 
this matter is just as good as its consent and 
agreement with Chick-fil-A’s actions. How can one feel safe and comfortable on a cam-pus that funds political causes directly tar -
geting its students?
As for the gross over-generalizations 
of the LGBT community’s ability to toler -
ate differing opinions, I believe we tolerate screaming preachers and fellow classmates 
every day who express their “inability to 
approve of the way [we] choose to live [our lives].”
We do not seek commendation, praise or 
even approval. I do not need my university to proclaim itself “pro-gay.” All we expect is equality, and all we reject is our status as second-class citizens. If these basic needs are misconstrued as “intolerance,” I feel that 
some of our students need a drastic reality 
check.
Think we’re on a level playing field? 
Think again. 
Katie Faris
UF employee
People mock what they don’t understand. Last fall, 
our country witnessed a string of suicides by gay teens as a result of bullying. These teens weren’t 
mocked for who they were — they were mocked because of who people assumed they were because of the label-ing and gay stereotypes that have been forced upon us by specific members of our community.
We are lucky to live in a city with a gay mayor. We are 
lucky to have been blessed recently with our own chapter of Equality Florida. We are lucky to live in a place that is as accepting as Gainesville. 
However, everyone else isn’t as lucky as we are. In 
many places, organizations like UF’s Pride Student Union provide a safe haven for men and women who are grap-pling with their sexuality, but here at UF our organization is more concerned with drag queens and perpetuating the 
homosexual stereotype than actually making a difference 
on campus. Don’t beg for equality and acceptance and then blatantly promote the “cultural stereotype.” Equal-ity stems from being equal, not from making an example of yourself for the heterosexual community to mock.
Programs like The Trevor 
Project and It Gets Better have 
been integral in the effort to show  that the gay commu-nity is made up of a plethora of different people. For the first time, the world is able to see not all of us fit the ste-
reotypical mold of a flaming homosexual. The community 
has come a very long way since a time when being brand-ed as homosexual automatically meant you loved glitter, interior lighting and Cher. However, all you have to do is turn to UF’s Pride organization, and suddenly we’ve been 
set back a hundred years.
Drag shows, an event with Christian Siriano and view-
ings of “I Love You Phillip Morris” are exactly the type of 
events that cause homophobes to assume all gay men and 
lesbian women are exactly the same, which couldn’t be 
farther from the truth.
Do I wear womens clothing? No. Because I’m gay, am 
I required to think anything Lady Gaga has to say is rel-evant? No. Is it wrong for gay men to enjoy football or things more commonly associated with heterosexuals? No, not at all. However, many people automatically as-
sume these things to be true. Why? Because the unfortu-
nate truth is that organizations like Pride have made it impossible for the rest of the world to see not all gay men want to flaunt their sexuality around like they got it half-
off at Neiman Marcus. 
For the closeted gay man who is terrified to come out 
because he assumes our culture is nothing but limp-wrist-
ed, drag-queen-loving femmes, let me be the first to tell you it’s not. There is nothing wrong with being proud, 
but there are certainly many other ways to celebrate who 
you are. Don’t let the negative stereotypes perpetuated by organizations like Pride dissuade you from just being yourself.
We don’t need these events to make us feel proud of 
who we are. I’d have a lot more pride if blatant homo-sexuals would stop embarrassing our community.

ON CAMPUS
By RACHEL STEPHENS
Alligator Contributing Writer
Eight-year-old Kendal Binkley loves hors-
es and wants to be a veterinarian when she 
grows up. On Saturday, she got a glance of what a day in the life of a vet looks like. 
Binkley and her mother came from Lake 
Mary to join more than 1,000 others at the UF College of Veterinary Medicine’s annual open house. 
From 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., visitors toured 
the animal hospitals, petted animals and ob-served medical equipment in use on live ani-mals. This year’s event featured the addition of the new UF Small Animal Hospital tour and pet adoptions. 
Groups of about 20 people were led on 
30-minute tours through the first floor of the new hospital, which contains the emergency receiving area and exam rooms.
On the tour, people were showed the 
emergency room, the intensive care unit and progressive care unit.
Guests also got to see an array of about 60 
different dogs and cats available for adop-tion. 
The animals were provided by Helping 
Hands Pet Rescue, a local volunteer animal adoption agency.Along with tours and adoptions, this 
year’s open house also featured events spe-cifically geared for children, according to Dana Zimmel, the chief of staff of the UF Vet-erinary Hospitals. 
“Part of our mission here is to encourage 
people to join our profession, and it starts at a young age,” Zimmel said. “And so we want to expose people when they’re small about this career path.” 
The UF Veterinary Hospitals hosted a 
pet-drawing competition for children at lo-cal elementary schools to raise interest in the event. A teddy bear clinic also was available for children who needed to have their stuffed 
animals repaired, she said.
Lectures were given for parents and teens 
who were interested in what it takes to get 
into the UF College of Veterinary Medicine, Zimmel said. 
UF has the only veterinary school in Flor -
ida, and about 800 people apply for only 100 spots given each year.Vet school opens doors for tours, animal adoptions
“Part of our mission here is to encour -
age people to join our profession...”

14, ALLIGATOR n MONDAY, APRIL 18, 2011
to record an out, allowing four straight hits 
and leaving with the bases loaded. 
Steven “Paco” Rodriguez, who recorded 
the save in UF’s 5-4 win Friday, replaced him. But the left-hander struggled with com-mand, walking in a run and surrendering the tying score on an RBI single. 
Greg Larson was summoned, and the right-hander stopped the bleeding. The ju-nior was the unsung hero for Florida on Sun-day, throwing 3.2 scoreless innings while scattering five hits. 
In the eighth, Tucker added some insur -
ance with a monster grand slam to right. 
“He left a changeup waist-high,” Tucker 
said. “I turned on it, and good things hap-pened.”
The five-run explosion in the inning gave the Gators’ reeling bullpen some much-needed breathing room. 
Florida’s heralded pitch-
ing depth struggled over the weekend, as its pen allowed 
11 runs and 18 hits in 8.2 in-
nings. 
On Saturday, after a 
strong start by Brian Johnson, who collected 
his second homer of the year with a two-run shot Sunday, the bullpen collapsed, giving 
up six runs with the game tied in the eighth en route to a 7-2 loss. 
“That happens from time to time,” Tucker 
said. “We have one of the best bullpens there 
is out there. [Sunday] just showed we can 
pick each other up. Sometimes the hitting has struggled and the pitchers have put up a zero, or the pitchers have had a rough inning, 
and we get a run the very next inning.”
BASEBALL , from page 15Familiar struggles on beam come back to haunt Gators in NCAA semifinals
been a wreck all weekend. I knew the same things were go-
ing through her head — all that I’ve been through, and now to end on this amazing note was just a blessing.” 
Despite the heartfelt ending to Smith’s career as an indi-
vidual, the final moments of the Gators’ 2011 season were far more bitter than sweet.
UF finished fourth in Friday night’s semifinals with a 
final score of 196.125, coming in just behind third-place Utah’s 196.2. 
Utah joined the top two finishers from the second ses-
sion, Nebraska and Alabama, in the Super Six. Saturday, the Crimson Tide became national champions. 
The blockade that held UF back from the chance to duke 
it out for the title was all too familiar. 
It was no secret that the balance beam was Florida’s 
weakest event throughout the season. 
Following a string of flawed beam routines in the NCAA 
North Central Regionals on April 2, the team honed in on 
its biggest splinter in the practices leading up to the week-
end’s competition. 
The Gators created pressure situations while performing intrasquads on the beam nearly every day prior to Friday, and the gymnasts said their confidence level had increased and their routines had improved as the meet grew closer.
Faehn said the team had at least seven intrasquads since 
regionals — all without one mistake, without one fall. 
But when the fifth-seeded Gators jumped onto the event 
to open the meet, all of their hard work seemed to vanish almost immediately. 
Florida’s first beam performer, junior 
Elizabeth Mahlich, fell off the beam, stum-bling to a disappointing 9.275. Moments 
later, Johnson wobbled her way to a 9.2. 
Florida’s gymnasts posted two of the 
meet’s four lowest scores in the event.
“I really don’t know what happened,” 
freshman all-arounder Mackenzie Ca-
quatto said. “We had a good practice [Thursday], and 
warm-up was great. It is just one of those fluky things, I 
guess.”
Faehn wondered in retrospect if she made a mistake 
slating Mahlich as the beam’s opener after her shaky re-
gional performance. 
“Even though she hit every intrasquad, she probably still had that in the back of her head and didn’t have the confidence to go up aggressively,” Faehn said. “It made ev-eryone tight when she had a mistake.”
After beam, the Gators had a bye, giving them time to 
recharge before the remaining three events. 
On floor, Johnson and Smith had particularly impres-
sive performances, as each earned an impressive 9.9 and King added a 9.925. 
The Gators also had solid vault and bars routines, with 
each gymnast scoring a 9.725 or better. Though some per -
formances had missed landings, there weren’t any major 
mistakes. 
But, it was too little, too late.“We had a really big hole to fill and just couldn’t come 
out of it,” senior Alicia Goodwin said. 
What made the run especially stinging was Florida’s im-
pressive year leading up to the competition. The Gators at 
one point held a No. 1 national ranking and beat Alabama, 
Utah and Nebraska in their regular season. 
“It is extremely disappointing because we know how 
talented this team is,” Faehn said. “But I told them talent 
doesn’t win championships — you’ve got to stay on the 
equipment. Unfortunately, we didn’t do that.”GYMNASTICS , from page 15

After a seven-year drought, the Florida men’s 
golf team captured the Southeastern Conference 
Championship tournament Sunday.
The No. 5 Gators’ 8-over-par score for the 
event was enough to beat No. 3 Alabama.
An already memorable day for Florida was 
made unforgettable by fifth-year senior Andres Echavarria winning the individual title in a dra-matic, sudden-death playoff against LSU’s John Peterson.
“I can’t put my emotions into words right 
now,” Echavarria said. “I’ve been through tough times as a Gator, and this win is the product of five years of hard work and preparation.”
Florida was able to maintain the six-stroke 
lead it held going into Sunday’s final round on the strength of 1-under-par rounds by Echavar -
ria and Bank Vongvanij. The Gators were also aided by an even-par performance from sopho-more Phillip Choi and a 3-over-par showing by Tommy Mou.
Vongvanij got off to a hot start Sunday, at 
one point notching four consecutive birdies on 
the front nine to lower his score to 3-under-par 
for the round. That put him in contention for the individual title, but two bogeys on the back nine ended his chances. Vongvanij and Choi finished in the top five, 
with Choi tying for third at even-par and Vong-vanij coming in fifth with a 1-over-par tally.
“I was a little nervous in that we kind of blew a 
six-shot lead at the Schenkel (Invitational) about a month ago, and we hadn’t won in a while,” UF coach Buddy Alexander said. “We just felt like it was our turn to win if we played like we played all year.”
The win is Florida’s 15th SEC golf title and the 
university’s 200th SEC Championship overall.
“We really have prepared 
well as a team all year,” Echa-varria said. “Winning this tournament was one of our 
goals at the beginning of the year, and it feels good to actu-ally win it.”
The team now has a long 
layoff before teeing off at NCAA Regionals in nearby 
Ocala on May 19-21.
The Florida women’s team’s struggles in the 
SEC Championship tournament continued Sun-day, as UF shot 8-over-par to finish ninth.
The Gators’ woes overshadowed an impres-
sive round by sophomore Mia Piccio, who re-bounded from a 9-over-par nightmare on Sat-
urday to shoot a 3-under-par 69. Piccio tallied 
five birdies on the back nine to finish the round under par.Florida men’s team brings

 UF OVERCAME ANOTHER 
BULLPEN COLLAPSE TO BEAT UGA ON SUNDAY.

While vicious storms up the east 
coast brought cooler temperatures 
down south, Preston Tucker was 
on fire Sunday in Athens, Ga. 
The Gators’ slugger mashed two 
home runs, including the go-ahead 
shot in the seventh, propelling No. 
4 Florida (28-9, 11-4 Southeastern Conference) to a 14-7 blowout and series win over Georgia (19-18, 9-6 SEC). 
“The bats just came alive,” Tuck-
er said. “I was looking for a pitch I could drive, and I got what I was looking for, and I handled it.”
The versatile lefty’s two-run 
shot in the seventh inning snuck over the right-field fence, and the Gators regained their lost momen-
tum after blowing a five-run lead.  
For the second consecutive 
game, UF’s bullpen suffered a de-
moralizing meltdown. But, unlike 
Saturday, Tucker and Co. rallied 
with the bats as the Gators plated 
eight runs in the fi-nal three innings. 
“We wanted to 
get a few runs for them (the bullpen), and hopefully they could shut it down 
at the end,” Tucker said. “They did a great job.”
Leading 6-3 in the sixth, UF 
coach Kevin O’Sullivan pulled freshman starter Karsten Whitson 
and inserted Alex Panteliodis. The 
unusual decision to give the junior his first relief appearance since March 1 backfired as the lefty failed Tucker, Gators crush

Florida’s season came to a disap-
pointing close Friday night, but one 
Gator left Cleveland as a national champion.
The UF gymnastics team failed to 
place in the top three in the semifinals of the NCAA Championships on Fri-
day in Cleveland, Ohio, by a mere 0.075 
points, but sophomore Marissa King captured the Gators’ first individual 
title since 1998 on Sunday.
With a score of  9.8750, King brought 
back the NCAA vault championship to Gainesville. The native of Cambridge, 
England, said she trusted herself to go into her routine with the same confi-
dence she displayed in practice.
“I went up there and saw all the 
parents and the rest of the team in the stands,” King said. “I gave them a smile 
because I was proud they were there and cheering for me. I just went into it 
knowing I could do it.” 
King was joined by freshman Alaina 
Johnson and senior Maranda Smith in the floor exercise finals, where Smith finished in a three-way tie for second 
place with a 9.9 in her final perfor -
mance as a Gator. 
Johnson, meanwhile, became the first 
Gator to compete in three individual events since 1998, performing on vault, 
bars and floor. Though she didn’t place 
in the top three in her events, UF coach Rhonda Faehn said she was pleased 
with the newcomer’s performance. 
After her lengthy journey through 
what she once thought was a career-
ending injury, Smith said it was an 
emotional moment.
“There were tears in my eyes but I 
had to stop that and get focused,” Smith 
said. “I wanted to remember every mo-ment of the minute and 30 seconds I 
was up there for my final routine.” 
Smith said she had always wanted 
to compete in the floor finals, and to have her dream come true in her final 
year was amazing. 
“I saluted the judges, I looked up 
at [my parents] and I knew they were emotional,” Smith said. “My mom’s King takes NCAA vault title as UF falls short of Super SixSEE BASEBALL, PAGE 14

UF LACROSSE
By JOHN BOOTHE

Three days after Florida snagged 
a share of its first American Lacrosse 
Conference title with a dramatic 
upset of No. 2 Northwestern, Van-
derbilt didn’t let the Gators take the 
crown outright without a fight.
After five ties and six lead 
changes against the Commodores 
on Sunday , the No. 6 Gators (14-1, 
5-0 ALC) needed a Brittany Dashiell 
free-position goal with just 30 sec-
onds left to edge Vanderbilt (7-7, 1-4 
ALC) 8-7 in Nashville, Tenn., and secure their first outright regular-season ALC championship.
“We came out flat because we 
were on such a high from North-
western,” Dashiell said. “We 
weren’t really focused too much on 
the Vanderbilt game. I know that’s 
how it was for me personally … but 
I had confidence the whole time that 
we would come out with the win.”
The Gators were limited to a 
season-low 23 shots, including four without a goal at the free-position 
arc before Dashiell’s final attempt. 
Florida’s cause was also hurt by an 
injury Kitty Cullen suffered against Northwestern. The nation’s leading 
scorer was limited to about 30 min-
utes of action and one assist.
“It took a lot of work, not only 
by Kitty , but by 
[athletic trainer] 
Anna [Hale] as well,” UF coach 
Amanda O’Leary 
said. “We trav-eled with train-
ing equipment 
that I had never 
seen before. They 
had her in the boot, they had her in the game ready, they had her do-ing another machine. I mean, Anna 
worked a lot to make sure that Kitty 
was ready to go.”
O’Leary also said sophomore 
midfielder Haydon Judge was lim-
ited by an injury and was “50-50” 
before playing against Vanderbilt.
Sophomore Ashley Bruns 
stepped up in the first half to fill the 
Gators’ scoring needs, recording a hat trick and two assists. But she 
was held scoreless the entire second 
half as Florida managed just two 
goals.
While UF wasn’t doing its de-
fense any favors with a season-low seven goals, the back line held Van-
derbilt scoreless for the last 27:16.
Dashiell’s late-game heroics were 
made possible when sophomore 
Mikey Meagher made one of her 
seven saves on a Commodores’ free-
position attempt placed perfectly at 
the center hash of the 8-meter arc.
“It’s definitely really exciting that 
we were able to go 5-0 in conference play ,” Meagher said. “We’ve had 
three conference games in one week, 
so I think we were a little tired, but 
it’s good to know that we can work 
through it and come out with the 
win.”Florida avoids letdown with close win over Vanderbilt

 FRESHMAN CHEYENNE COYLE HIT 
THREE HOMERS ON THE WEEKEND.
By STEPHEN SHEEHAN 
Alligator Writer 
 
For the past few weeks, Florida coach Tim 
Walton has been waiting for production from 
the bottom of the lineup.  
This weekend, his patience was reward-
ed. 
Led by shortstop Cheyenne Coyle’s three 
homers over the first two games, and third 
baseman Kasey Fagan’s solo shot Sunday, 
UF’s Nos. 6-9 hitters went 16 for 39 at the 
plate as No. 10 Florida (37-7, 13-6 Southeast-
ern Conference) earned the series sweep with a 13-4 drubbing of No. 24 Auburn (32-12, 11-9 SEC). 
“Two weeks ago, people were talking 
about how we’re down,” Walton said. “Here we are having our best weekend of the sea-
son. Once you get it going on offense, it can 
be contagious.” 
The Tigers had no answers for the Gators’ 
suddenly deep lineup as UF pounded 16 hits 
Sunday and set the single-game school record 
with eight home runs. 
Sophomore Brittany Schutte and senior 
Aja Paculba each hit a pair of long balls Sun-
day as UF exploded for 35 runs in the series.  
“When a team gets hot, it doesn’t take a 
whole lot to keep them going,” Walton said. 
While the middle of the order produced 
at its usual pace, the team’s two freshmen in-fielders opened some eyes. 
Coyle’s steady production from the sev-
enth spot has been key given Fagan’s incon-
sistency hitting out of the nine hole. 
“The key was the bottom of the lineup 
keeping us going,” left fielder Kelsey Bruder said.
“With every single se-
ries, they get better,” Bruder 
added. “That’s to be expected 
with more experience and the knowledge they gain on how 
different teams approach us.” 
BROMBACHER’S RETuRN gOES WELL : Al-
though it will take some time for her bicep to get back to full strength, Saturday was a big step for Stephanie Brombacher. The senior ace pitched for the first time 
since March 12 and tossed 4.2 solid innings in UF’s 8-2 win, giving up one run on five hits 
and one walk while striking out four. 
“I was a little nervous since I haven’t faced 
hitters in so long,” Brombacher said. “My ap-proach was a little different, but after the first 
inning, I was comfortable.” 
Brombacher said she needed to let her bi-
cep “cool down” to limit inflammation over 
the past month.
After putting her on a 50-60 pitch count 
Saturday, Walton plans to take things slowly 
with Brombacher as she builds up her veloc-
ity. 
“We’re not going to put a timetable on it,” 
Walton said. “We’re very optimistic she can 
get better as we go forward.”Bottom of lineup comes around in sweep of Tigers
