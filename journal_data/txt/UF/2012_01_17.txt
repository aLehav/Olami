Santa Fe College police recovered a student’s backpack 
Sunday morning, three days after she was kidnapped, but 
ofﬁ  cers are still searching for the culprit.
The victim, an 18-year-old Trenton woman whose name 
has not been released, is safe. She jumped out of the suspect’s truck hours after being abducted in a school parking lot.
The victim is unsure of the man’s race, though she said 
his complexion is dark, according to an 
Alachua County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce state-ment. The suspect stands somewhere be-tween 5 feet 8 inches and 5 feet 11 inches, and he is in his late 20s or early 30s.
He has short hair, an unshaven face 
and a right hand marked with a tattoo, according to the Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce. He was wearing a dark hoodie and jeans Thurs-day.
His pickup truck is small and a dark color. It has dark-
tinted windows and a gray interior.
The suspect forced the woman into his pickup truck at 
gunpoint between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m. on Thursday. The wom-an rode in the front of the truck, gun pressed against her, for a couple hours before jumping out of the vehicle when it slowed down on Northwest 39th Avenue, Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce Police search for

TALLAHASSEE — UF President Ber-
nie Machen emphasized the importance of 
general education along with science and math during a conversation with the Florida House of Representatives higher education committee in Tallahassee on Friday.Last month, Rep. Bill Proctor, chair of the 
higher education committee, invited all 11 state university system presidents to partici-pate in discussions focused on improving higher education in the state.
“We simply want to solicit, as best we 
can, their opinions,” Proctor said on Friday.
Machen and Proctor discussed the possi-
bility of tying some ﬁ  nancial aid to STEM — science, technology, engineering and math — degrees.
If more Bright Futures Scholarship mon-
ey were available to STEM majors, it might help some students decide what to study, Machen said.
Allocating more ﬁ  nancial aid to STEM 
majors could improve the four-year gradu-ation rate, he said.Additionally, Machen suggested univer-
sities charge higher tuition for STEM degrees because of their high cost to schools relative to other degrees.
Universities could make a case for charg-
ing higher tuition for programs that cost more, he said. “It’s very defensible.”
Another idea Machen presented to the UF suggests higher tuition for science, engineering students

Flashing blue lights, police cars blocking the streets and 
ofﬁ  cers yelling at residents to remain inside greeted Ame-
lia Butler as she walked home early Friday morning.
Butler, a 19-year-old public relations sophomore, was walking to the Delta Zeta sorority house at about 1 a.m. when she witnessed the aftermath of an armed robbery that took place around midnight near Sorority Row.
“It was a little intense,” said Butler, who is the sorority’s 
house manager. “I was just like, ‘Oh wow, another one?’”
A 24-year-old UF student and a 27-year-old woman 
were walking on Southwest Ninth Street when a man ran up from behind and pointed a handgun at the student’s face, said Gainesville Police Department spokeswoman Cpl. Angelina Valuri. The woman gave up her purse, which was later found at Southwest Fifth Avenue, about a block north of the attacks. 
The suspect ran north after the attack and is still at large. 
The second woman present described him as a black man in his late 20s, about 5 feet 7 inches tall and of average build.

Yvonne Hinson-Rawls, 64, is one of three candidates running 
for the District 1 seat of the Gainesville City Commission.
ALLI LANGLEY
Alligator Writer
Yvonne Hinson-Rawls saw 
Gainesville residents unable to find 
jobs. She saw graduates unable to stay in town with their ideas. She saw children unable to succeed in school.
Retired educator Hinson-Rawls, 
64, is one of three candidates for the District 1 seat of the Gainesville City Commission. The election is Jan. 31.
“I saw a need,” she said. “I had to 
go. I couldn’t just sit by and do noth-ing.”
Hinson-Rawls said her three big-
gest concerns for the city are creating jobs, attracting businesses and devel-oping programs to help parents effec-tively raise their children.
To reduce unemployment, she 
said, she would create a job-training center in partnership with local in-dustries. The center would train peo-ple to fill job openings at city busi-nesses. This would connect workers with local businesses that need them, she said, and attract businesses to the city.
Hinson-Rawls said investing in 
green technologies and alternative energy, which goes along with her environmental preservation platform, would also bring in businesses.
To keep talent and ideas from leav-
ing Gainesville, Hinson-Rawls said she would encourage students and innovators to take advantage of the new Florida Innovation Hub at UF, an incubator for science- and technol-ogy-based start-up companies. 
“Why isn’t Gatorade bottled 
here?” she asked. “We’re inventing here, we’ve innovating here, we need to keep it here.”
For Gainesville’s families, she 
wants to focus on youth programs where children can play sports and learn dance, art and music. These pro-grams make kids more well-rounded and self-confident, she said, and they give parents a safe place to leave their children.
“If this is something parents 
want,” she said, “then it’s something we need to provide for them.”
Born and raised in her district, 
Hinson-Rawls lived in Long Island, Miami and Atlanta before moving back to Gainesville about six years ago.
“I may be the only candidate with 
real ties to this community who wants a better life for this community,” she said.
She graduated from UF with a 
bachelor’s degree in 1971 and a mas-ter’s in 1972, both in special educa-tion. She then worked with children in special education in New York.
After five years, she moved to Mi-
ami where she continued working in the school system. She became the principal of a high-tech magnet school in a low-income neighborhood a few years before Hurricane Andrew hit.
She took advantage of an outpour -
ing of government aid to rebuild her school and meet with leaders of the community to transform the neigh-borhood into a more commercial area with middle-class homes.
After retiring, Hinson-Rawls 
started her own company, Childstart Learning Solutions. The business provided tutoring for students in low-performing schools in Louisiana, Georgia and Florida, including Ala-chua County.
Because of her experience run-
ning a school and a business, Hinson-Rawls said she has managed million-dollar budgets. She said she knows how to find money being wasted and make sure citizens’ tax dollars are well-spent.
To fund the programs she has in 
mind, Hinson-Rawls said she would prefer to refocus existing programs without changing their staff, facilities or budgets.
She said her goals of lowering un-
employment, attracting businesses, educating students and parents, re-ducing crime and preserving the en-vironment are all connected.
“Everybody needs to share in the 
prosperity of Gainesville,” she said.
Candidate focused on jobs, social programsCommiSSion rACecommittee was a common undergraduate expe-
rience in the form of a course of general educa-tion classes required for all students.
UF undergrads enter the university with an 
average of 28 credit hours from advanced place-ment or dual enrollment classes, Machen said.
Most of the credits are for general education 
classes, which restricts options for classes all stu-dents would be required to complete.
The solution is to create a nine- to 12-credit 
multidisciplinary course based on critical think-ing and problem solving that would bring stu-dents of different majors together in the same room.
“The only time they get together is on foot-
ball Saturday,” a problem that needs to be fixed, he said.
Committee vice chair Janet Adkins asked if re-
quiring the course would decrease the four-year graduation rate, a main concern of Machen’s.
He said most students’ failure to graduate in 
four years is because they don’t want to leave, not because they can’t complete required class-es.
“How do we get these incredibly bright young 
people to come to college and then leave?” Ma-chen asked. “I just can’t get them to leave.”4, ALLIGATOR §  TUESDAY, JANUARY 17, 2012

People wearing capes, robes, 
skin-tight suits and hats adorned 
with animal ears were among those who attended the first SwampCon at the Reitz Union on Saturday. 
The convention brought to-
gether about 1,600 fans of anime, gaming, role-playing and science fiction. 
SwampCon featured a cos-
tume contest, a musical parody of the science-fiction television show “Doctor Who,”  and a panel discussing gaming and anime topics.
Attendees could also stop by a 
maid cafe, where servers dressed as maids and played games with the customers.  
By the end of the day, the maid 
cafe ran out of cups and plates, and the convention had run out of wristbands. 
The 500 chairs in the Reitz 
Union Ballroom were not enough to accommodate the crowd to watch the “Doctor Who” musi-cal. Gator Anime started planning 
the convention in late September, said club president Ciara Powell, 20. 
“We’re hoping we can have a 
two-day convention next year,” said Powell, an electrical engi-neering junior. 
Gator Anime funded the con-vention with about $1,400 from Student Government, she said. 
On the Reitz Union North 
Lawn, people with foam and wooden swords and shields en-gaged in live action role-playing, known as LARPing. 
Kira and Kiko’s Arts & Crafts 
displayed furry hats made to look like they had cat ears, which SwampCon attendees could buy earrings for. 
A sign at Kira and Kiko’s table 
read, “We’ll pierce your hat even if you didn’t buy it from us!”
A banana-yellow 2000 Volk-
swagen Beetle with black-tipped ears and a tail was parked in front of the Reitz Union Colonnade during the convention.  
The car was modeled after 
Pikachu, the yellow hamster-like character from Pokemon.  
Belle Starenchak, 35, owns the 
car.
Starenchak, who goes by Pika-
BelleChu, is in the 2009 Guinness Book of World Records Gamers Edition for her collection of Pika-chu memorabilia. 
Starenchak came to Swamp-
Con dressed as Itachi from the anime show Naruto, wearing a floor-length black trench coat with blood-red details and a jet-black wig that framed her face. 
“Escaping reality is always 
great,” Starenchak said.Reitz Union hosts anime, gaming, science-fiction convention

for undergrads also discussedVictim’s backpack recovered Sunday
spokesman Art Forgey said.
The victim ran toward a neighbor -
hood, and a woman in the 1200 block 
of Northwest 39th Avenue called 911 at 7:50 p.m. reporting that she heard some-one screaming for help. The victim last saw the suspect driving west.
The search began when the woman’s 
parents called the Santa Fe College Police Department around 6:30 p.m. Thursday, Forgey said. They noticed something was wrong when their daughter wasn’t home in time for dinner.
The parents told SFPD where their 
daughter normally parks, and officers found evidence of a struggle near her car. 
While they were in the parking lot, a 
witness told the officers two men were riffling through a backpack before tak-ing it Thursday evening. Police searched the campus a couple times but came up short.
The Sheriff’s Office released a state-ment Saturday saying officers were try-ing to find the white backpack, which has vertical lines of hearts on it. Daryl Johnston, the director of Santa Fe Col-lege’s Institute of Public Safety, found the backpack sitting in a grass field on the northwest corner of campus around 11 a.m. on Sunday.
Anyone with knowledge of the kid-
napping should call the Sheriff’s Office at 352-955-1818. If you wish to remain anonymous, you can call Crime Stoppers at 352-372-7867.

Recent crimes spark interest in self-defense
past month. On Dec. 9, a man robbed and attempted to rape 
a UF student.
The recent crimes near Sorority Row prompted Butler to 
register for a women’s self-defense course sponsored by the University Police Department.
The Community Services Division of UPD is registering 
members of UF sororities for a free Rape Aggression De-fense, or R.A.D., course. Registration for sorority women began Monday, Jan. 9 and will continue until Feb. 28. 
The course consists of four three-hour sessions. Classes 
will begin Tuesday, March 13 for the sorority women and will be taught over several weeks, said Officer Susan Pratt of UPD’s Community Services Division. She also serves as the R.A.D. and radKIDS coordinator.Each session in the course will be available for several 
days before the next one starts.
Course completion requires that participants attend the 
first three sessions, which include a lecture, basic techniques and practicing defense combinations with an instructor. 
However, Pratt said the fourth session is everyone’s fa-
vorite: the “fight day” when participants get to fight with police officers.
“When people walk out of here, they feel so proud of 
themselves because they one, finished it, and two, they got away safely,” she said. “That’s our main objective: to es-cape.” 
The only men allowed into classes are certified R.A.D. 
instructors.
Maria Keely, Kappa Alpha Theta’s chief Panhellenic of-
ficer, said that with recent incidents, it is important for wom-en to learn about their options.
“When it starts happening to your friends and to your 
sisters, you want to make sure that everything is going to be as safe as possible,” said Keely, a 20-year-old occupational therapy sophomore.

� ABOUT 2,000 PEOPLE ATTENDED THE 
ANNUAL EVENT.
BENJAMIN S. BRASCH
Alligator Writer
Gainesville mothers pushed strollers, the el-
derly walked with their canes and people sang 
hymns at the annual march to remember the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.
“We have these activities so others don’t 
forget,” said Diyonna McGraw, vice president of the Martin Luther King Jr. Commission of Florida Inc.
About 2,000 people attended the commemo-
rative event, she said.
“This is an opportunity to educate young 
people,” said McGraw, 42. “Because of King, we march. And we march to remember his mis-sion.”
The march started at the Bo Diddley Com-
munity Plaza and ended at the Martin Luther King Jr. Multipurpose Center.
“The march is symbolic of King’s legacy and 
his march,” she said. “If we forget the past, we are doomed to repeat it.”
Gainesville Police Department closed down 
West University Avenue from East 11th Street to Waldo Road and down Waldo Road to North-east 10th Avenue.
“We are here to educate about what he stood 
for,” said Derrious Robinson, 21-year-old UF electrical engineering senior.
Robinson is the president of Alpha Phi Al-
pha Fraternity, the same fraternity King joined
Robinson said he and his fraternity members 
are  proud to call King a brother and excited to continue his legacy.“He had a huge impact on how black stu-
dents are treated on campus,” he said. “We want to get involved in MLK’s mission.”
He said all students should look to King as 
an inspiration.
“More student organizations could get in-
volved with his legacy,” he said.
Some students celebrate King’s memory 
through service.
Rachel Richards, 23, coordinator of a city-
wide service day, said about 250 people volun-teered Monday morning.
The 12 volunteering sites included Wilmot 
Gardens, Florida Organic Growers and the Children’s Home Society, she said.
“[King] was inspired by service because he 
saw it ﬁ  rsthand,” she said.
King saw service as an important compo-
nent of his life, she said.
“He saw what it did for the community. He 
saw what it did for him,” Richards said. “And he wanted to give to that cycle, and that is why students are inspired by him.”
Rodnie Saint-Germain, 19-year-old Santa 
Fe College health science sophomore, said she had never marched in a King celebration before Monday.
Saint-Germain said the speakers inspired 
her to march.
She said she plans to walk again next year.“I came here for MLK. This is the least I 
could do,” she said.Gainesville celebrates MLK day

prepare for Wikipedia’s shutdown?
Friday’s question: Are you going to see 
Drake at the O’Connell Center in February? Fast food disassociates us from nature
It seems characteristic of man, today more than ever, to move further away from his natural self with each notch of progress added to his belt. All things consid-
ered, we lead undeniably different lives from our ances-tors, those born from sub-Saharan plains and those who built civilization. Our current rate of progress is unparal-leled and exponential. And though industry and technol-ogy have proven beneficial, providing alleyways of oppor -
tunity and countless resources for personal and cultural growth, their rate of progress is outpacing our ability to evolve alongside it.
Accompanying industry’s benefits are a number of 
temptations that effectively detach us from the primitive roots from which we’ve sprouted. These temptations cause a shift in the ways we form and perform basic acts that once contributed to the survival, specification and procre-ation of our species. Most notably, though not exclusively, is the radical change in the methods we use to obtain and consume food. As a whole, we no longer glorify the hunt, the harvest or the preparation of meals. Instead, we have steadily debased an act as visceral as sex itself.
The fast-food industry is regarded as a godsend to 
many. Fatty, greasy, fried goodness sold at questionably low prices and served quicker than you can swipe your plastic — adored by binger, stoner and pauper alike. And while the prices are to die for — through painful cardio-vascular complications — the industry itself dissociates us from a very specific process of drive-satisfaction inherent within our nature: collecting and cooking our own food.
For the majority of our 200,000-year history, the alpha 
male was venerated for returning home with a carcass slung over his shoulder. The hunt, that great expense of energy, was justified as the meat sizzled over fire. Today, parents need only return home with a paper bag of meat substitute to silence the stomachs of their children.
Yet the substantiation of a hard day’s work, which was 
so integral to the hunt and satiation of our ancestors, has been replaced by a day at the office and a transaction with a cashier. Similarly, appreciation for the food bearer is also being neglected, as no hunt transpired and no cooking was performed, only an eight-hour workday that indirectly led to an instrument used to buy rapidly fried food. 
A void lies within the con-
sumer, as fast food, despite its decadence, seems to have appeared out of thin air, neither substantiated nor ex-plained by any sensible process in which the eaters have partaken. 
On a drunken night, during famished fits of quiet des-
peration, I’ll admit I’ve bought a burger from one of the many quick kitchens lining University Avenue. In this drunken stupor, each bite is heaven, a savory kiss from Mother Mary that might only be bested by sex with some-one far less righteous. Yet, as the last morsel passes my lips into the acidic abyss, I’m struck with a sensation of utter repulsion and self-loathing. Not merely mental, but physi-cal unease and nausea consume me entirely.
Replace this experience with an alternative night: It’s 
2 a.m., and I’m drunk again. I decide to cook myself steak and eggs in the confines of my kitchen. Save for the fire hazard of a drunk at the stove, this act is one of the most gratifying I ever perform. The smell of a sizzling steak is as pleasing a sensation as the act of eating. Knowing that my time and effort are contributing to this meal satisfies some-thing primitive within me as I fulfill at least some degree of survival and self-reliance. 
This is not to say that you’ll find me at Paynes Prairie 
hunting buffalo for my next meal; it is to advocate getting as close as possible to the origin and preparation of our meals, if for no other reason than greater indulgence.

Congress should kill 
‘anti-piracy’ bill
It appears as though one widely unpopular piece of leg-islation, the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) might be killed before the House of Representatives can bring it 
to a vote. 
According to The Hill, House Majority Whip Eric Cantor, 
R-Va. hinted to Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., that the bill would not be brought to a vote without some sort of consensus.
This change in direction has probably come in wake of re-
cent opposition of the bill from the White House and many members of the online community. For example, Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales has announced plans to shut down his website in protest of the bill on Wednesday. 
However, even if Cantor’s hint turns out to be true, the 
fight to prevent this overreach of government into the Inter -
net will not be over. 
SOPA’s sister bill, the Protect Intellectual Property Act 
(PIPA), is still making its way to through the Senate. 
According to Reason magazine Associate Editor Peter Su-
derman, these pieces of legislation “would make it a felony for any website to stream copyrighted material and essen-tially allow the blacklisting of entire domains.” 
While stopping online piracy sounds like a noble cause 
to some, the vague language of these bills make them far-reaching and hostile to the freedom of exchange that the In-ternet provides. 
For instance, you could be fined or jailed for posting a 
video of yourself singing a copyrighted song. And although browsers like Firefox are already creating ways to circum-vent these potential rules, according to Andy Greenberg at Forbes Magazine, these methods could make Internet users more vulnerable to hackers and identity thieves. 
Whether it be through the guise of anti-piracy or net 
neutrality, the government has been trying to gets its slimy hands on the virtually unregulated Internet. To lawmakers, the Internet is a Wild West that must be tamed.
Others (correctly) view the Internet as a place for free 
expression, new ideas, increased commerce and creative opportunities on a scale that we have never seen. Sure, the Internet has predators, piracy and obscenity as well as bla-tantly racist, ignorant and false information. But overall, this is a small price to pay for the overall rewards the Web gives to people all over the world. 
Recording and film studios have come out in favor of this 
legislation without any concern over the loss of free expres-sion and creativity that makes their industries possible in the first place. 
If the House of Representatives does decide to kill SOPA, 
it would be a huge step in the right direction. We hope the White House will follow through on its promise to stop ei-ther version of this harmful legislation from becoming law.

Letters to the Editor
Interior design requires licensing 
In response to the editorial addressing in-
terior design licensing, the students of UF’s 
Department of Interior Design would like to have the opportunity to respond to the many misconceptions about the profession put forth. 
The National Council for Interior Design 
Qualification defines interior design as “the art and science of understanding people’s behavior to create functional spaces within a building. Decoration is the furnishing or adorning of a space with fashionable or beautiful things. In short, interior designers may decorate, but decorators do not design.” Commercial design projects require an occu-pational license to protect the health, safety and welfare of the occupants. Unfortunately, many injuries and fatalities in the past result from inadequate design. At UF, we learn to design health care facilities, educational in-stitutions, corporate environments, etc.  
Many professions require education, ex-
perience, examination and licensing. Why should the interior design profession be any different?
Note: Thirty-nine students from the UF 
Department of Interior Design endorsed this statement.

Editorial misses depth of interior design 
work
This letter is in response to the Alligator 
editorial about the interior design profession. 
While the paper acknowledged making an er -
ror regarding interior design licensing in the state, the editorial perpetuates a commonly held stereotype about the profession.
Designers are not decorators.Think about it this way. When you receive 
your schedule of classes for the semester, do you prefer a classroom in one building over another? Does the quality of the interior space matter to you? Would you prefer to receive medical treatment in a sterile but cold hospi-tal room or a warm and comforting environ-ment? Upon graduation, would you prefer to work in a windowless office or in one flooded by natural light with inviting meeting spaces and conference rooms, perhaps even a coffee bar? 
UF interior design students work on proj-
ects like these, including solving design issues at the Career Resource Center, Levin College of Law, P .K. Yonge Developmental Research School and the Harn Museum. Our program, which recently was recognized as third in the nation, teaches students creative problem-solving in areas ranging from space planning to construction documentation and technol-ogy to lighting.
Interior design is not an intuitive process. 
We do pre-design research and conduct post-occupancy evaluations. We not only have ac-credited bachelor’s programs, but also offer master’s degrees and Ph.D. specializations. Interior design is both an art and a science. Today more than ever, we need spaces that not only comply with building codes, but also address functional requirements in innovative and inspiring ways. We seek out memorable spaces that are authentic and reflect a sense of place.
Not only have our students engaged in 
projects on campus and across the state, but our upper-division students were an integral part of the student design team from building construction, architecture and public relations who designed, built and promoted a fully solar-powered house for the Solar Decathlon competition, traveling to Madrid and most re-cently competing in Washington, D.C. 
Our students have received national 
awards and recognition for their work. We might be one of the best-kept secrets on the UF campus. To find out more about the profession of interior design and the UF Interior Design Program, visit our website at www.dcp.ufl.edu/interior or stop over in the Architecture Building to see firsthand what we do.

On my 18th birthday , my 
father took me to the Department of Motor 
V ehicles to renew my driver’s license. Among the several privileges granted to me the day I became a legal adult, in-cluding the elimination of my curfew, was one promised to me in the 15th Amendment of the Constitution: the right to vote.
When registering to vote, 
citizens glance over the rarely-heard-of third parties, such as the Constitution, Green and Libertarian parties, and make a check mark in front of either the Republican or Democratic Par -
ty . The choice is easy based on a person’s upbringing, whether they choose to join their par -
ents’ party or rebel against it. 
It seems as though once the 
box is checked and the form is signed, a person’s voting future is sealed, and he or she will vote for his or her predetermined party in every election. There is no need for most people with the same mindset to  examine a politician’s stances because you must automatically fly on the right or left wing on all issues at hand.
This could be ideal, making 
candidate selection very easy , but I believe it’s safe to say that not everybody sees every issue as equal. I, for example, priori-tize energy, environmental is-sues, education and the war in Iraq. Someone else may not see conservation as an important issue but be very devoted to whether or not abortion is legal or illegal. 
And it’s likely that I and the 
person in my hypothetical ex-ample will not find all of our ideals in one party . Some of our issues may lean right and some may lean left. In this case, which party should we side with? The an-s w e r : nei-ther.
Un-
wavering devotion to either major political party has caused conflict in our country since the Whigs were considered a major party . 
We celebrate when our 
party dominates the House and get bitter when they do not. We insult the opposing party and blame all our nation’s problems on its actions. The opposite party is always ignorant, stupid and incompetent. 
And, because of all this hype, 
elections have become more about what political party we are affiliated with rather than what is really important: The changes we want to see happen with a new person in office.
We should consider Gan-
dhi’s words of being the change we wish to see in the world.
Following his advice, we 
may not be able to single-hand-edly end the war in Iraq or le-galize gay marriage, but we can choose a leader who wants to see the same change we do.
Instead of absentmindedly 
voting for a person who be-longs to a particular party , we should examine our own be-liefs and ask ourselves what we want to see happen, then pick the candidate who will use his or her power to see this change through, regardless of his or her political party . The battle between the Democrats and the Republicans is a common goal for a better America. We, as its citizens, should use the issues in need of address, not political affiliation, when exercising our right to vote.

Every third Monday in January, Americans re-
member the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. But what does this day represent?
Let’s begin with the historical truth behind it. King  
was a man whose contributions will transcend time. His efforts helped create a world of peace, freedom and equality.
During the Civil Rights Movement, African-Amer-
icans made great strides toward equality in this coun-try.
Milestones included the Montgomery bus boycotts 
led by Rosa Parks, who refused to give her seat to a white man, and the acclaimed 1957 Little Rock Nine — nine black students admitted to all-white Little Rock Central High School in Little Rock, Ark.
The students were protected by National Guard 
troops from furious white citizens who tried to stop them from entering the school.
Although those events happened only 50 years ago, 
our parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins remember them as if they happened yesterday.
Have we come a long way since then?Yes. But we have a long way to go as well.After King’s assassination in 1968, Congressman 
John Conyers of Michigan pushed for a day to remem-ber this civil rights leader. It wasn’t until 1983, however, that Congress passed this leg-islation, signed by President 
Ronald Reagan, to officially recognize it as a federal holiday.
For me, Martin Luther King Jr. Day is a time when 
Americans can sense an everlasting unity that goes beyond the chains of color. It is a day when we no longer have to suffer from unjustified treatment from the government or the people. 
Americans can celebrate being free to dine or sit 
with any group of people regardless of race or eth-nicity. Most importantly, we are free to appreciate the hue of our skin and to wear it with pride whether it’s charcoal black, ivory or somewhere in-between. Like King said,  “I look to a day when people will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.”
That day is approaching. Each generation will be-
come more accepting and tolerant of new cultures and customs, keeping King’s dream alive in the depths of their hearts.

Ray Washington, 56, is one of three people running for the District 
1 seat of the Gainesville City Commission. 
CommiSSion rACe
JULIA GLUM
Alligator Writer
Thirty minutes before the noon 
deadline to run for the Gainesville 
City Commission, Ray Washing-ton walked into the Supervisor of Elections office, smartphone in hand.
He checked his email one last 
time to see if there was a response from District 1 candidate Yvonne Hinson-Rawls, whom Washington had contacted about a controver -
sial biomass contract. 
There was no response from 
Hinson-Rawls. The other candi-date, Armando Grundy, had al-ready refused to declare his posi-tion on the matter. 
Washington filed his paper -
work 14 minutes before the dead-line.
Washington, 56, is one of three 
people running for the District 1 seat on the Gainesville City Com-mission. Elections are Jan. 31.
He opposes a Gainesville Re-
gional Utility biomass contract, which he said will raise utility rates. He said this issue will espe-cially affect low-income residents living in District 1, some of whom cannot afford to pay higher bills.
Should Washington be elected 
and garner support from three other commissioners, he said, the commission could vote to rework the GRU contract.
The city commission voted on 
the contract in 2009. The contract does not currently have a back-out clause that would allow it to be canceled.
“I don’t want to live in a city 
where my district where I live — not as a politician, just where I live — is going to be forced into this terrible economic catastrophe,” he said.
Although his focus is rate 
hikes, Washington’s platform also includes working to make neigh-borhoods safer, making the city government more transparent and expanding opportunities for young people.
Washington is no stranger to 
Gainesville. Although he was born in Georgia, he has lived in the Gainesville area since 1978.
Washington has lived in Dis-
trict 1 — in the same house in the Colclough Hill neighborhood — for 19 years.
He’s a former Gainesville Sun 
reporter but is currently an attor -
ney specializing in environmental, family and criminal law. He also does due process and pro bono work.
He briefly attended Vanderbilt University before transferring to Duke University. After three years at Duke and a summer session at UF, Washington graduated from Duke with an English degree. He later went to law school at UF.
Some of Washington’s best 
memories of Gainesville include canoeing on the Suwannee and Ichetucknee rivers during the summer of 1974.
Washington has a wife, Eliza-
beth, and three sons.
Washington likes soul and Mex-
ican foods but hates rutabagas. He loves Bruce Springsteen’s music.
David Washington, his 23-year-
old son, said his dad has a “corny, but funny” sense of humor.
He said his dad is commit-
ted to making Gainesville better. His dad’s meticulousness would make him a good commissioner, he said.
“He will not turn any project in 
or do anything unless he knows that it’s done 100 percent and what it was intended to be at the outset,” he said.
He remembers walking over to 
City Hall after school as a child to sit with his father in the meetings.
“It was just his passion,” he 
said. “I hope Gainesville sees what I see in him and is lucky enough to be represented by him.”

Coach Amanda Butler’s first 
career win against LSU on Sunday 
was almost a crippling loss.
After the Gators took a 14-point 
lead at the 6:36 mark, the Tigers went on a 12-0 run to make it a 55-53 game with 2:35 to play. But Flori-da managed to outscore LSU down the stretch, holding off the Tigers’ rally to secure the 62-58 victory.
Beating LSU gave UF its first 
home win in Southeastern Confer -
ence play and ended a two-game skid.
“To play good teams close 
doesn’t do anything for our confi-dence, and that’s who we were as a team last year,” Butler said.
“It’s huge for us going forward 
to not be chasing momentum but to actually feel like we have some.”
However, the celebration was 
short-lived as Butler confirmed postgame that sophomore Kay-la Lewis would 
be out for the season due to a stress fracture in her hip.
Lewis, who 
is averaging 6.7 points and three rebounds per game, has not played since Florida’s 72-58 win against then-No. 21 Florida State on Nov.

A year after he didn’t even lead the team in assists, Florida point guard Erving Walker is second in the 
Southeastern Conference this season with 90, trailing only Tennessee’s Trae Golden (91). 
WOMEN’S BASKETBALL� HE HAD SEVEN ASSISTS IN 
SATURDAY’S WIN.
JOHN BOOTHE
Alligator Staff Writer
Entering his senior season, Er -
ving Walker was challenged by 
Florida coach Billy Donovan to do less.
As a 5-foot-8 point guard nearly 
four years removed from play-ing high school ball in Brooklyn, N.Y., Walker had spent the major -
ity of his college years carrying the Gators’ shooting load.  
He ended his freshman year 
with Florida’s best 3-point percent-age. As a sophomore, Walker was second in points, followed by last season, when he led the team in scoring.
This year, Donovan requested 
that Walker simply focus on pass-ing more.
“His goal needs to be to lead the 
league in assists,” Donovan said back in October. “With us having more shooting around Erving and with his speed and quickness, he needs to be a guy who has a great assist-to-turnover ratio.”
But for Florida’s most experi-
enced starter, facilitating rather than scoring would take time.
Walker played in all 37 games 
of the Gators’ Elite Eight season in 2010-11, but he didn’t even lead his own team in assists. That feat was accomplished by Chandler Par -
sons, a 6-foot-9 forward, who went on to be the Southeastern Confer -
ence Player of the Year.
“It’s been an up-and-down pro-
cess, but I think it’s getting better,” Walker said. “Just learning as a team, I think we (are) still learning — even though it’s mid-January — we (are) still learning.”
Saturday at South Carolina, 
Walker appeared to turn a corner, tying a season-high with seven as-sists to just two turnovers in a 79-65 Florida victory.
For the first time on the road 
this season, his missed shots, on a 3-of-5 shooting night, didn’t total more than his assists. As a result, the No. 17 Gators (14-4, 2-1 SEC) also grabbed their first true away win, ending a 0-4 streak.
Walker, a finalist for the Bob Walker responding to 
Donovan’s demands
UF focuses on post 
with Lewis out for year At halftime of Saturday’s game against 
South Carolina, it looked like Florida’s road woes would continue.  
The Gators were playing well and their ball 
movement was as strong as it’s been all year, but the scoreboard in Columbia still read 41-40, Gamecocks. 
Then, Florida’s un-luck ran out. South Carolina stopped hitting prayers and 
UF — clearly the superior team for the third straight road game — came through in the way it couldn’t against Rutgers and Tennessee, eventu-ally pulling away for a 79-65 win. 
While Florida’s 53.2 percent shooting and 19 
assists versus 10 turnovers provide a stark con-trast to previous road games, the biggest differ -
ence was defense. 
After a week of practices with bubbles over 
the baskets to shift the Gators’ focus to defending and rebounding, the results showed Saturday. 
Donovan, normally hesitant to apply full-
court pressure without a few thousand Rowdy Reptiles backing him up, showed no such con-cerns against South Carolina. 
Florida harassed the Gamecocks for the ma-jority of the game, and while the results did not necessarily shine through in the box score, Donovan had his wishes satisfied. 
“When you’re at 
home, it’s easier to play defense,” Donovan said after Tuesday’s win 
against Georgia, a game in which the Bulldogs were held to 48 points. “No question, the crowd, the comfortable environment. Can we now flip that switch mentally and be able to take that to the road?”
The Gators’ answer was an emphatic yes. Florida held South Carolina to 41.8 percent 
shooting despite the usual road misfortunes. 
Bruce Ellington unintentionally banked in 
three baskets worth eight points. Brenton Wil-liams, who entered the game 3 of 13 from beyond the arc, hit a 24-foot shot over Kenny Boynton and Erving Walker just minutes after knocking down a desperation 26-footer. Boynton said Wil-liams wasn’t even in the scouting report. Defense the difference in road winSEE HOOPS, PA gE 15

Florida junior Carolina Hitimana captured the consolation singles title 
at the Freeman Memorial Championships in Las Vegas last weekend. 
ELI MARGER

Michael Alford and Caroline Hitimana won 
their respective consolation singles titles last 
weekend, capping a solid trip to start the spring season for the men’s and women’s tennis teams. 
With the No. 8 men competing at the South-
eastern Conference Indoor Championships in Lex-ington, Ky., and the No. 1 women at the Freeman Memorial Championships in Las Vegas, several Gators turned in impressive performances to end their weekend on a high note. 
In Las Vegas, the Gators sent three women to 
face some stiff competition, as the top five teams in the country, including Florida, were in action during the weekend. 
Hitimana, Alex Cercone, and Olivia Janowicz 
made the trip with Hitimana winning the conso-lation singles title over Duke’s Ester Goldfeld in three sets. 
The Belgian junior won the match 6-1, 2-6, 1-0 
(10-4) and captured her second career singles title. Hitimana’s previous title came in the 2010 SEC Coaches Fall Classic.  
Hitimana won the remainder of her matches af-
ter losing her opening match to Southern Califor -
nia’s Sabrina Santamaria, the nation’s 18th-ranked player. Alford, a sophomore from Tampa, bounced 
back from an opening-round loss to reach the consolation singles final, where he defeated South Carolina’s Kyle Koch 6-3, 7-6. 
After posting an 8-3 in singles play during the 
fall, Alford shook off a loss to Georgia’s KU Singh in the opening round. After that, Alford found his stroke and won his next five matches, two coming in straight sets. 
Several other Gators also had good weekends, 
as Florida’s doubles team of Andrew Butz and Bob van Overbeek played a strong tournament, reaching the semifinals before being eliminated by Georgia’s team of Wil Spencer and Garrett Bras-seaux. 
The women’s doubles team of Cercone and 
Janowicz made it to the quarterfinals of its draw, where the duo was defeated by Southern Califor -
nia’s Santamaria and Kaitlyn Christian, the No. 3 tandem in the country.
The tournament also marked 
the first match and win of Florent Diep’s Gators career. 
The sophomore transferred mid-year from 
France and played his first collegiate match on the tournament’s opening day. He defeated Koch, who would later fall in the consolation finals to Alford in straight sets. 
With the tournaments completed, attention 
will now shift to the teams’ first dual matches of the season. 
The men will travel to Waco, Texas, to take on 
No. 5 Baylor on Jan. 22. The women will be in ac-tion three days later as they play host to Troy. That match will begin at 3 p.m. at Linder Stadium.Gators open spring against top teams

Center Patric Young did not start for the ﬁ  rst time this season against South Caro-
lina because he is dealing with what is thought to be tendinitis in his right ankle.  
Young to have X-rays, MRI soon
Cousy award, given to the nation’s top point 
guard, now ranks second in the league with 90 assists, trailing Tennessee’s Trae Golden by only one. 
  “Really for the entire game, we really made 
good decisions,” Donovan said. “We moved the basketball and made a high number of as-sists with a good number of turnovers.” 
  Despite a 10-assist showing in its last away 
game at Tennessee, and 6-foot-9 center Patric Young limited by injury, Florida tore apart South Carolina’s defense with a season-best 19 assists. 
Florida was averaging just 12.5 assists in 
previous true road games, and Walker’s ef-fort is even more impressive considering 20 percent of his assists have gone to Young this season.
  Young didn’t start for the ﬁ  rst time this 
season and played just 13 minutes due to sus-pected tendinitis in his right ankle. He will undergo X-rays and an MRI on his injured ankle this week, Donovan said Monday.
  “My team’s working with me,” Walker 
said. “They’ve been great in understanding that it’s deﬁ  nitely a process, and it just doesn’t happen overnight.”
  After Kenny Boynton knocked down a 
ﬁ  rst-half three off a Walker assist, the junior guard returned the favor by passing up a breakaway layup with 3:34 left and dishing the ball back to Walker on the wing. 
  “As I looked back, I seen Erving running 
too. So I knew if I went up with it, it probably would’ve gotten blocked, so I just threw it out to Erv,” Boynton said.
  Walker drained the three, his ﬁ  nal shot of 
the game, to push him into double ﬁ  gures with 11 points.
  But even as the Gators lead the nation 
with 195 threes — 25 more than the combined amount of their next two opponents, LSU and Mississippi — Walker can take pride in also guiding the SEC’s top assisting team.
  Florida has 304 assists as a team and, with 
13 games left, is on pace to dish out more than last year’s team, which ended the season on top of the league in assist statistics and in the overall standings.
  “As a basketball player, you don’t want to 
be labeled as one type of player,” Walker said. “So to be able to do multiple things, I would say is a good thing.”

  Take away those ﬁ  ve makes worth 14 
points, and South Carolina would’ve scored 
51 points on 32.7 percent shooting. 
  That’s the type of effort it takes to win 
major college basketball games on the road. 
  The Gators are a team that relies heavily 
on their offense, and as the nation’s leader in adjusted offensive efﬁ  ciency entering Monday according to kenpom.com, it’s right for them to do so. 
  But, as Donovan constantly preaches, 
shots aren’t always going to fall. Getting a ball with a diameter of about 9 inches to go through a hoop with a diameter of 18 inches from distances of up to 24 or 25 feet is an inexact science. Because of sheer prob-ability, some days it’s going to go well and some days it won’t.  In the face of this variance, Donovan 
wants to control things that have nothing to do with luck or chance, like defense. Effort, toughness and positioning are the same against every team in every arena, and the Gators need to be able to keep them con-stant even as opposing crowds surge. 
  That was the point of the intense week 
of practices, and that work paid off on Sat-urday.  
  Struggling to play that way on the road isn’t a conundrum unique to Florida. Teams currently ranked in the AP Top 25 are 65-42 in true road games and 307-23 in all others. 
That’s just the way college basketball 
works. 
  Donovan has admitted that learning to 
bring their ‘A’ game outside of Florida is an ongoing process for the Gators, but at least they have ﬁ  gured out where to start: defense.

Erving Walker
UF point guard 17.
Lewis, who switched from 
guard to forward during the 
offseason to help shore up the Gators’ inside game, began to feel discomfort against the Seminoles. At the time, Butler said she would take a “wait-and-see” approach to Lewis’ injury, but now Florida will have to compensate for her absence. 
With the exception of junior 
forward Jennifer George, Flori-da’s post play has been inconsis-tent and underwhelming.
The Gators’ struggles down 
low have been magnified by a 2-3 start to SEC play.
Florida has been outscored in 
the paint 142-122 by league foes, an average of four points per game in five contests that have all been decided by six points or less.
While the Gators’ post players 
have had to get by without Lewis since mid-November, the situa-tion has become more desperate now that there is no possibility for her return.
As the team leader with 13.6 
points and 9.6 boards per game, George recently saw her consecu-tive double-double streak end at eight games after a 15-point, eight-rebound performance in last week’s loss to No. 15 Georgia.
George then went cold in Sun-
day’s 62-58 win over LSU, play-ing just four minutes in the first half because of foul trouble.
She ended the game with six 
points, her worst offensive show-ing since a four-point effort in a 63-49 loss to then-No. 11 Rutgers on Dec. 2.
Fortunately for the Gators, a 
limited George paved the way for redshirt senior Ndidi Madu to shoulder the burden down low.
Starting in place of struggling 
senior center Azania Stewart for the second consecutive game, Madu scored nine points and grabbed five rebounds.
“We can do this every night. 
We just have to be more consis-tent,” Madu said.
Without Lewis, Florida will 
rely on Madu to become a consis-tent No. 2 option in the post.
Madu has taken advantage of 
her increased playing time, scor -
ing the Gators’ first points against the Tigers and the Bulldogs.
“Starting, I know have to be 
aggressive,” Madu said. “That’s the shot my teammates and my coaches expect me to hit, and when I’m open, when I get it, I’m going to take it.”
