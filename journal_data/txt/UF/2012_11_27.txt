Gainesville Police will 
be shopping for a new 
pawed partner and medi-
cal equipment with some of 
Gainesville residents’ lunch money.
The Firehouse Subs Public 
Safety Foundation recently awarded Gainesville Police $20,300 to buy eight auto-mated external deﬁ  brillators and a new police dog.
The grant is part of a 
$300,000 donation from Firehouse Sub’s nonproﬁ  t organization to 16 law en-forcement agencies and ﬁ  re departments across north-
east Florida and southeast 
Georgia.
GPD spokesman Ofﬁ  cer 
Ben Tobias, Capt. Ed Posey, 
Ofﬁ  cer Jeff Kerkau and his 
police dog, Roo, will receive the grant in Jacksonville to-day.
Tobias said he was excited 
about the foundation’s grant to the department.
“It’s amazing,” he said. 
“Any time we have a com-
munity partner that can help 
serve the public better, we’re all for it.”
With the grant, Tobias said GPD would start the search for the department’s newest canine on Thursday.
Founded in 2005, the 
foundation works to provide funding, lifesaving equip-ment and educational op-portunities to public safety ofﬁ  cials by raising money 
through in-store donations 
when customers round up their bill.  
The foundation has donat-
ed more than $5.2 million to local ﬁ  re and police depart-ments, about $1.1 million of which was donated to agen-cies in Florida, according to a 
company press release.
Tobias said he looks for-
ward to adding a new police 
dog to the unit, as well as 
buying the new deﬁ  brilla-
tors.
“That’s eight more chanc-
es for us to save a life,” he said.

Black Friday lived up to Nava 
Ottenberg’s expectations.
Ottenberg, owner of Persona 
Vintage Clothing & Costumes, said 
her store had a rush of shoppers on 
Black Friday , and the sales were a 
much-needed boost for the local re-tail scene.
“You wish you didn’t have to do these madness 
days and people would be aware of local stores,” 
she said. “You do 
anything you can to bring them in.”
According to 
data from the Na-
tional Retail Federation, Black Fri-day weekend brought in about $59.1 billion nationwide. An estimated 247 million shoppers visited stores and websites this past weekend.
Several Gainesville retailers ran 
special promotions for Black Friday , 
cashing in on the shopping holiday 
dominated by big-box stores.
Ottenberg said she marked ev-
erything down 15 percent to help attract shoppers and bring in more business.
She said campaigns to support Gainesville boutiques reaped 
beneﬁ  ts of this year’s Black Friday“Any time we have 
a community partner 
that can help serve the 
public better, we’re all 
for it.”

UF’s Interfraternity Council partnered 
with Study Edge earlier this semester, and 
it’s paying off.
The tutoring company offered a 50 per-cent subsidy to all new members of UF IFC chapters who signed up for their services. IFC vice president of ﬁ  nance Joey Rosati said the initiative was more successful than an-ticipated — members from all 27 chapters used the program.
Coined the Pledge Edge Initiative, the program was created to help improve new members’ GPAs during their pledge semes-ter, according to a press release.
“We really wanted to make it a goal to 
make sure that new members, or pledges, are receiving the best education possible,” said Rosati, who is also the executive board representative for the Pledge Edge Initia-tive. “You have these rumors out there that the pledge semester is detrimental to their grades.”
Rosati said the initiative consists of a joint 
fund between the IFC and Study Edge. The fund reimburses pledges for half of the cost of the Study Edge services they used during the Fall semester.
The fund is currently capped at $5,000, 
with half coming from the IFC’s scholarship budget and half coming from Study Edge’s

For some students, The Swamp 
is more than the home of the Flor -
ida football team. It’s a library, a 
cafeteria, a classroom and a gym.
On a game day, more than 
80,000 people sit and sweat in its seats. But on a weekday, students, Gainesville residents and visitors use Ben Hill Griffin Stadium as a part of their daily routine.
The stadium is open to the 
public every day from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m.
The stadium was first built in 
1930 with a capacity of 21,769, ac-cording to GatorZone.com. It has since been renovated and expand-ed to fit more than 90,000 people. It was named Ben Hill Griffin Sta-dium at Florida Field in 1989.
Students eat lunch, study, drink 
Starbucks, run stadiums and hang out inside. The Florida Cicerones show prospective students and their families the stadium as part of its campus tour.
Blaire Shoor, a 20-year-old UF 
finance junior and vice president of programming for the Cicerones, points out people running stadi-
ums when she’s giving a tour. She 
said the final stop on the Cicerones campus tour is the stadium, where potential students learn how to get tickets for UF sporting events and how to get involved in intramu-rals.
“We save the best for last,” she 
said. “It’s the part of our university that sells itself.”
Gainesville photographers use 
the field and stands to take gradu-ation and engagement photos. UF professors occasionally take their students there for a class.
High school-aged athletes are 
among those who use the stadium as a running course.
Sophie Newman, a 19-year-old 
UF advertising sophomore, said there are benefits to doing stadium workouts instead of going to the gym.
“I think stadiums are a good 
option for people who are bored with working out or want to work out outside,” she said. “You can do just about anything in a stadium.”
On Tuesdays and Thursdays, 
UF freshman finance major Colin Mooney, 18, purposely gets to Yon Hall, located on the east side of the stadium, early for his technical communications class so he can sit in The Swamp before class starts.
One day while he waited, he 
sat in one of the chairs in the south 
end zone, ate his chicken sandwich 
from Chick-fil-A and looked out over the empty field.
“It’s peaceful,” he said. “It’s 
cool to see it when it’s so empty.”
Shoor said she thinks the uni-
versity keeps the stadium open to the public because it’s an iconic place.
“It belongs to more than just 
the football team,” she said. “It’s something we can all appreciate.”
The Swamp offers more than a football field to some students

Students on UF’s campus 
have been “Whisper”ing this 
semester.
The iPhone app allows 
people to anonymously post 
secrets and comments about 
anything from opinions on Gator football to confessing love for classmates, similar 
to the popular website www.
PostSecret.com, said Kim-
berly Percuoco, manager of UF Whisper. The UF Whisper Facebook page — “Whisper 
on University of Florida” — 
has garnered nearly 800 likes 
since its launch.
“It is a great avenue to 
vent,” Percuoco said. “You 
can say what you want to say 
without posting it on Face-
book, where everyone knows you.”
To post a Whisper, a user 
can pick a picture, either on 
his or her iPhone or from the 
Internet, and add text to the picture before posting it.
Users can also select the 
“nearby option,” which al-
lows them to view all posts 
within a mile of them. The “nearby option” has been es-
pecially prevalent in commu-
nities with colleges, creating 
conversation among users 
studying on the same cam-pus, Percuoco said.
For example, the UF Whis-
per Facebook page recently 
featured Whispers regarding 
the UF-Florida State Univer -
sity football game.
Percuoco and the man-
ager of FSU’s Whisper page 
came up with the idea to get 
competition going between the schools leading up to the 
game, she said.
“I don’t think we fear any-
thing... FSU is gator bait!” 
one read.Jacqui Sousa, a 19-year-old 
nursing student, said she does 
not think the app will achieve 
huge popularity because us-
ers cannot follow people like on Twitter or Instagram.
“You follow certain people 
because they say interesting 
or funny things,” Sousa said. 
“But here you can’t because it is anonymous.”
There is a feature that lets 
users have usernames, but 
the posts are mostly anony-
mous.
Public relations major 
Carolina Garcia, 20, said she thinks the app will catch on.
“People are always look-
ing for new types of social media to look at,” Garcia said. 
“This could be another thing 
to keep people entertained.”
Users don’t have to be UF 
students to use Whisper. The app is free and available to 
the public. It is currently only 
available on the iPhone, but 
an Android app is in devel-
opment.App keeps secrets hushed at UF4, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 27, 2012

◗ HOOKUP RATES ARE 
HIGHEST IN OCTOBER AND LOWEST IN JUNE.
CARA CHIARAMONTE
Alligator Contributing Writer
College students are “hook-
ing up” — but not as often as 
you may think.
Hooking up is less frequent 
among first-year college stu-
dents than having sex in a ro-
mantic relationship, according to a recent study conducted by researchers at the Miriam Hospital’s Centers for Behav-ioral and Preventive Medicine and published in the Journal of Adolescent Health.
According to a ScienceDaily 
press release, hooking up is any type of sexual intimacy involv-ing partners who are not in a romantic relationship or dating without any mutual expecta-tions of commitment.
Robyn L. Fielder, a research 
intern at the hospital, said 483 first-year female college stu-
dents were asked how often 
they participated in oral and vaginal sex with casual and romantic partners. “During the first year of college, 40 per -
cent of women engaged in sex 
within hookups,” she wrote in 
an email. “Fifty-six percent en-gaged in sex within romantic relationships.”
Sexual relations involving 
only kissing and sexual touch-ing were not measured because oral or vaginal sex is more likely to influence public health issues 
like sexually transmitted dis-
eases or pregnancy, she said.
Melissa Yawn, a 19-year-old 
English freshman at UF, said she didn’t agree with the results 
because she thinks college stu-
dents are more likely to engage in sexual activity without being 
romantically involved.
A key reason for this, she 
said, is the “everyone-else-is-
doing-it mentality.”
“College-aged students typ-
ically jump into doing things in the heat of the moment instead of considering consequences of their actions,” Yawn said, add-
ing she thinks the results are 
inaccurate because “random hookups” are less likely to be reported.
Fielder said between 7 and 
18 percent of women reported oral and/or vaginal sex within a hookup each month. Mean-while, 25 to 38 percent said they 
had sex within a romantic rela-
tionship each month.
Fielder said the research 
can assist health programs for the college-aged population 
develop. The research could 
help correct common miscon-ceptions of students and their sexual relationships, especially at larger institutions like UF.
“Educational and health 
promotion campaigns, condom 
distribution and STD screening 
for college students may have 
the most impact if concentrated 
at the beginning and end of the 
academic year, when students are hooking up more often,” she said.
According to the press re-
lease, the highest hookup rates occurred in October. The low-est were in June.
“Hooking up is one way that 
young people explore intimate relationships,” Fielder said. “But it is often exploratory and is not the most common way.”Freshmen women find

A house divided didn’t stop Alyssa Baron from 
getting in touch with her Jewish roots.
Baron grew up in Boca Raton, Fla., with a Jewish 
mother and a Catholic father. Growing up mostly 
under Catholic influence, Baron as a young teen 
confided in her family about her interest in the Jew-
ish youth group BBYO.
After six years of involvement, Baron, a 19-year-
old business administration sophomore, earned the BBYO Community Engagement Fellowship on Nov. 19.
The fellowship aims to make Jewish students’ 
transition between high school and college easier while enhancing Jewish life on campus, said Elyse 
Goldberg, BBYO communications coordinator.
About 40 students across the nation applied for 
the fellowship, and Baron is one of nine recipients.
“I was already doing the duties of a fellow at UF 
before the title,” Baron said. “The fellowship will 
just help me to further my connection to the Jewish students on campus.”BBYO, formerly known as the B’nai B’rith Youth 
Organization, helps Jewish teens in middle schools and high schools build leadership skills, and it pro-vides an outlet to make friends within Jewish com-munities, Goldberg said.
This is the first year the organization offered a 
fellowship for college students. Baron said each recipient is offered $1,000 each semester to put on events for the Jewish community.
Baron said she is planning career services events 
for UF’s Jewish community members so they can network with each other and BBYO alumni. She plans to recruit one member of BBYO’s board of di-rectors to help with resume and interview critiques for Jewish students in Gainesville next semester.
Baron said one of the most important aspects 
of her leadership role is getting students involved with organizations that fulfill their cultural needs.
“When I was a freshman at UF, my BBYO men-
tor was a senior who basically took me under her wing,” Baron said. “She helped me get involved on campus, and now I want to provide that connection for students.”New community fellowship intended 
to encourage UF Jewish community
Some local stores received a rush
small businesses have helped bring attention 
to the clothing store.
“We’re trying to bring local people in 
here,” Ottenberg said.
Andrew Schaer, owner of Hear Again 
Music and Movies, said he didn’t have any special deals on Friday. Instead, the store of-fered limited-edition vinyl records.
“When I got here in the morning to open 
up, there were 40 to 50 people waiting,” he said. “It was a really big turnout.”
He said Miles Davis titles sold the fastest. 
The store still has some limited edition items on display, but he said the majority of items were sold during the weekend.
Steven Kirn, executive director of UF’s David F. Miller Retailing Education and Re-search Center, said he doesn’t think local stores should try to compete with department store prices on Black Friday.
“They’d do much better if they focused on 
things that would make them successful in 
the long run,” he said.
He said smaller stores should focus on 
providing good customer service and unique 
merchandise to attract customers.
While some stores received the typical 
post-Thanksgiving rush, others had only a trickle of customers.
Hayley McIntosh, a sales representative at 
Wolfgang Clothing, said the store saw fewer 
customers over the weekend because stu-
dents weren’t in Gainesville.
“It’s harder to get people to come in on 
breaks,” she said. “We can’t really control who’s here for Thanksgiving.”
She said 14 people visited the store on 
Black Friday, while about 50 people typically visit on sale days.
Kirn said national sales this weekend in-
creased from 2011.
“I think it’ll be a good holiday season,” he 
said.SAlES , from page 1The IFC plans to continue the initiative
budget.
“We didn’t expect to hit our 
cap,” Rosati said. “I think $100 we 
had remaining, which we ended 
up distributing to everybody.”
In order to use the program, 
new members had to say they were referred to Study Edge by their 
“pledge educator” when register -
ing for services.
Recently, the fund was split up, 
with each chapter’s educator re-
ceiving a check for a portion of the 
money, along with an Excel spread-
sheet that showed how much each new member should receive.
Rosati said the chapters with the 
most registrations were Alpha Ep-silon Pi, Sigma Chi and Alpha Tau Omega. All IFC chapters received at least $50 from the program.
Rosati said the IFC is planning 
on continuing the initiative in the Spring. It is also planning on help-ing the Panhellenic Council start a similar program next Fall.
“It worked better than we 
thought, and it grew faster than we thought,” he 
said.
While it won’t 
be known if the

She said that while Study Edge 
wanted to try out the program with 
the Greek community, they could

Students can dance the Macarena, deco-
rate Reptar cookies and conduct Bill Nye sci-
ence experiments at the Reitz Union Board Entertainment’s Hip-Hop Until You Don’t Stop Throwback night.
The event corresponds with RUB Enter-
tainment’s ‘90s-themed week and is sched-uled for 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. Wednesday in the Reitz Union’s Rion Ballroom, said RUB Entertainment Special Events Committee co-director and 20-year-old journalism senior Hana Engroff.
There will also be a “name that” contest 
where students can name a song title, charac-
ter from a TV show or ‘90s fad based on clues, 
she said. Winners will get ‘90s-themed prizes like Lisa Frank pencils.
Attendees can eat Fruit by the Foot and 
drink orange soda, Engroff said.
The ‘90s theme was the top-voted theme 
week after RUB Entertainment polled fans on its Facebook page, said president Lauren Gray, a 22-year-old digital arts and sciences senior.
Kaliene Lambert, a 20-year-old ﬁ  nance 
junior, said she’s looking forward to the Bill Nye activities at the event.
“[Nye’s videos] always played in science 
class,” she said. “I haven’t seen anything from him in forever.”
Recalling memories is the intent of ‘90s 
week, Engroff said.
“I think people will really appreciate just 
reliving their favorite songs and favorite times from the ‘90s,” she said.

Gainesville Police ofﬁ  cers ar-
rested a man accused of raping a 19-
year-old autistic man in a northwest Gainesville park.
At about 3:30 p.m. Sunday , Joe 
Van Scott Jenkins, 19, of 622 Queens Road, and his friend, whose name was not released by police, were walking from The Oaks Mall to Cof-
rin Nature Park, located north of 
Northwest Eighth Avenue, accord-ing to a GPD arrest report.
Once inside the park, Jenkins al-
legedly pinned the victim against a tree and raped him.
Two witnesses walking along 
a park trail saw the men and inter-rupted them.
GPD spokesman Ben Tobias said the victim screamed at the witnesses 
to call police while Jenkins ﬂ  ed from 
the area.
After the ofﬁ  -
cers interviewed 
the victim, an am-bulance took him to Shands at UF for treatment.
Meanwhile, 
police located and arrested Jenkins in the 4800 block of 
Northwest Eighth Avenue.
During an interview with detec-
tives, Jenkins said he had known the 
victim for about three years, accord-ing to the report.
Jenkins denied raping his friend, 
saying the victim had threatened to call police and report he had been raped if Jenkins did not have sex 
with him.Jenkins added that he engaged in 
the sex act out of fear.
Later that afternoon, police 
booked Jenkins into the Alachua 
County Jail on a sexual assault charge, which is a second-degree felony.
As of Monday night, Jenkins re-
mained in jail with a $20,000 bond.

Calm down, there is 
no ‘war on men’
There are very few words to describe all the emotions we 
felt when reading Suzanne V enker’s piece on Fox News’ website titled “The war on men.”
“Women aren’t women anymore,” wrote Venker.Well then. Let’s delve deeper into her article and see how she 
explains herself.
“In a nutshell, women are angry,” wrote Venker. “They’re 
also defensive, though often unknowingly.”
Is “confusion” an emotion? We deﬁ  nitely felt that when we 
started reading. Follow along as we ﬁ  nd other words to label our emotions other than “angry” or “defensive!”
Thank you, V enker, for showing women in a positive light. 
Finally , someone is brave enough to call out the shortcomings of an entire gender by using generalizations. Just kidding. That 
was an example of us feeling “sarcastically bewildered.”
How in the world could a woman write an entire article that 
blames modern women for not getting married even though 
they want to while claiming that we’re leading a war on men?
“All the articles and books (and television programs, for that 
matter) put women front and center, while men and children sit in the backseat,” wrote Venker. “But after decades of browbeat-ing the American male, men are tired. Tired of being told there’s something fundamentally wrong with them. Tired of being told 
that if women aren’t happy, it’s men’s fault.”
Sorry, that noise you just heard was the sound of our brains 
breaking. Nope. All of those words feel completely opposite 
from the truth. Now we feel “sad.”
Does she really think women are leading a war on men in 
the media? Sarah Palin would probably argue to the contrary. Hillary Clinton might have something to say about it. Michelle Obama’s arms, while magniﬁ  cent, could feel a bit awkward about all the attention they get.
Sometimes women receive attention from the media. The 
media has not led a war on men as a gender. So, how has femi-nism, or the media’s portrayal of feminism, made men feel?
“It has pissed them off,” wrote Venker. “It has also under-
mined their ability to become self-sufﬁ  cient in the hopes of some-day supporting a family. Men want to love women, not compete with them. They want to provide for and protect their families — it’s in their DNA. But modern women won’t let them.”
We feel “disappointed,” at best. 
We’re not sorry about wanting equal treatment. We’re not 
sorry if being more equal makes some people feel that they’re in 
a competition of who can provide for a family the best.
The point of feminism, and other movements similar to it, as 
we understand it, is to receive equal rights, opportunities and at-tention. That’s it! It isn’t a war on men; it’s a war on inequality.
Venker’s article received a lot of attention because so many 
people thought her point of view was outrageous and hilari-ously out-of-touch. She should realize that her article is perpetu-
ating the problem she proposes. She’s portraying women as the 
aggressor and putting them at fault for the world’s problems.
Women aren’t the problem. They’re in the middle of a re-
sponse to a problem.
Today’s question: Will you attend any of the ‘90s Week 
events?
41% YES
59% NOMonday’s question: Did you go Black Friday shopping?Explaining the error of human judgment
More than a year after the trial ended, new evidence 
has arisen in the case of Casey Anthony . She was 
placed on trial three years after her toddler’s remains 
were found. Anthony was acquitted after being charged with 
the murder of her 2-year-old daughter, Caylee.
Ultimately, the only conviction Anthony received result-
ed from lying to police.
Authorities overlooked information from Anthony’s In-
ternet browser. They found a search about suffocation, and 
an article related to poison and suicide methods, according 
to a recent article by the Associated Press.
In my opinion, the jury of this case was wrong in their 
decision. I’m aware the media spotlight surrounding the controversial case didn’t make reaching a verdict any easier. 
However, a much more ﬁ  tting decision could and should 
have been made regarding the defendant’s actions and the life that was lost.
The Anthony case was just one of many times the Ameri-
can justice system has dealt with difﬁ  culty, uncertainty and scrutiny in reaching a verdict.
Are we innocent until proven guilty or guilty until proven 
innocent? Who can we really trust to make decisions regard-
ing the fate of people’s lives?
This brings us to the concept known as the imperfection 
of the human being. Simply stated, a good amount of the 
time we’re wrong, impartial or unsure and have too much 
pride to admit it.
So many diseases and illnesses negatively impact the lives 
of people around the world; the epidemiology is identiﬁ  ed, 
and the symptoms are similar. Science and research are both advancing.
Somehow cures for AIDS, cancer and a number of other 
conditions have yet to be shared. Do we really know every-thing?
My heart goes out to the victims still recovering from the 
damage of Hurricane Sandy. Who would have predicted this 
disaster months ago? The peak of hurricane season is over, 
then out of nowhere a storm devastates the Northeast.
Can we always predict what’s going to happen?Recently, there have been a few people in Texas who want the state to secede from the United States. Correct me if I’m wrong, 
but the last time an idea like this 
was actually acted upon, the Civil War happened and almost ruined the nation. Is every unconvention-al idea always a great one?
Some people I know regard 
Korean singer PSY’s “Gangnam 
Style” as the most annoying song 
they have ever heard. However, the song’s music video re-
cently earned the title of most viewed video on YouTube. More than 820 million people have seen it.
Are our own opinions always the most valid?
Life manages to surprise us every day.
Things happen. Unfortunately, this means bad moments 
will happen in addition to the better ones. Somehow we con-
vince ourselves nothing can go wrong. We think we know 
everything.
Never underestimate the irony of life.If I believe in anything, it’s that we can and should expect 
the unexpected. Sometimes, we become so bold and conﬁ  -
dent in our logic and plans. However, a small margin of error 
always exists for a reason.
When calculating numbers, scientists always include 
something called an uncertainty.
The answers are shared as a value, plus or minus a certain 
amount of units. Uncertainty is a measure of error that ac-counts for the fact that mistakes happen. It recognizes that most of the time we’ll end up at least a little off from the true answer. It provides a range of possibilities knowing that all 
of the time, results may vary.
We are humans, and nothing in our world is perfect.
We should let go of pride and always be open to some-
thing we may have been wrong about. I personally believe life would be just a little bit easier if more people didn’t be-
lieve they were invincible to any kind of error or wrongdo-
ing.

Letter to the Editor
I recognize as citizens of the United 
States we have the right to publish our 
opinions — no matter how misguided, poorly researched or morally questionable they may be. When I read an article in my 
own college newspaper condemning Israel 
for defending itself as thousands of rockets have been hurled into the state and into ci-vilian towns, I was truly disgusted by the lack of thought put into the writing. There was no substance. No facts. Just an out-of-context quote from Nelson Mandela. This is not good journalism, this just sounds like anti-Semitic garbage. I find it comical that people could think it’s acceptable for terror -
ists to blow themselves up on a public bus in Israel because we all know that would never be tolerated in the U.S. Furthermore, 
to accuse Israel of ethnic cleansing? May-
be these two individuals are unaware of Hamas’ warning to Israel: “We love death more than you love life.” Please share with these two “journalists” some actual facts, a concept they seem to confuse with poorly (at best) researched opinions.
Sixty-four trucks of food were trans-ferred from Israel to Gaza
Sixteen trucks of medical supplies were 
transferred from Israel.
Twenty-six patients in need of care en-
tered Israel from Gaza for medical treat-
ment.
Israel has halted attacks when civilians 
are in danger because Hamas uses its own 
citizens as human shields.
Hamas hides its rockets near residential 
homes, playgrounds and mosques.
I could go on and on.Look, I appreciate that people have the right to their own opinion. However, as a UF student who has family and friends in Israel, I find this article extremely offensive and uneducated. Many Gators work hard to combat anti-Semitism, and articles like 
this just spread it further. If the content 
was true, it would be one thing, but quite frankly, Israel is the furthest thing from an apartheid state. Next time, do some re-search.

I am not a music snob. I don’t particularly care if you think 
either The Beatles or One Direction is the best band of all time.
I hate One Direction, but it doesn’t bother me that other 
people love them. What does bother me is when people try 
to justify their certifiably terrible taste in music.
Not content to associate with other people with similar 
tastes and be content with their poor choices in life, these peo-
ple try to convince you there is some reason they shouldn’t be damned by their love for crappy music.
Here are some of the ludicrous justifications people have 
given me for the bands they like:
1. It’s catchy and/or has a good beat.This is probably the most common throwaway excuse for 
liking much of what’s on hit radio. It’s popular because it’s often true, which can confuse the person they’re talking to long enough for them to run away singing the lyrics to “Call Me, Maybe.”
While true, this justification is ultimately meaningless. 
Commercial jingles and the songs on “The Wiggles” are catchy. That doesn’t make them good. The ability to burrow into your head is a facet of both good and terrible songs and shouldn’t be a part of the conversation.
Furthermore, the beat of a song, although it can be ab-
solutely fantastic, cannot make up for terrible music or lyr -
ics. Techno songs often have really great beats, but listen to them for more than 15 seconds, and, unless you’re on some strong drugs, your head will explode. Beats can be integral in a song, but they cannot save them.
2. They have a good song that’s less popular.Someone I know tried to convince me that Ke$ha wasn’t 
terrible with this one. Let me say first that everything about 
Ke$ha, including the spelling of her name, makes me literally 
sad for today’s music culture. I don’t mean that sarcastically . I mean actually sad. Anyway, Ke$ha having one arguably “good” song certainly doesn’t justify the main body of her work being a travesty, does it?I mean, Hitler brought Germany 
out of a bottomless depression, and that doesn’t really make him a good leader. He also loved dogs, but none of that gets mentioned due to the 
other stuff he did, nor should it. Go listen to Ke$ha’s song “The Harold Song.”
Ask yourself, do you think that song is good enough that 
in 20 years Ke$ha won’t be remembered as the girl who had two No.1 singles without being able to sing, rap or dance?
3. You’re just a hipster/hater.This is certainly a favorite of the musically impaired. In 
fact, I wouldn’t be surprised if many of you reading this had this thought about me already. It’s a somewhat effective 
strategy because it totally disqualifies anything you have to 
say about music as a subject.
They’ll often follow this comment with something like 
“Go away and listen to The Smiths or something.” This dis-missal is common in every area of taste. Anyone who dislikes something that is in any way popular or broadly appealing must be on the obscure fringe and impossible to please. It’s illogical because it doesn’t address how crappy their musical tastes are, and it sets up a false stereotype of their opponent.
For example, I hate One Direction, but I think Justin Tim-
berlake’s “FutureSex/LoveSounds” is the best pop album since “Thriller.”
Don’t get me wrong, The Smiths and much of what is con-
sidered “hipster” music is very creative and engaging musi-cally, but I, like almost everyone else in the world, have a range of tastes in music. Dismissing someone because they’re a “hater” is silly as well because it’s sort of the inverse of call-ing someone a hipster.
It similarly implies they belong to a mindless group, just, 
perhaps, a larger one.  In conclusion, like the music you like. If others hate it, just accept that.I don’t try to justify my love for Maroon 5. I know they’re terrible, and I’m OK with that.

Speaking Out
Banning the sale of bottled water on campus 
might seem like an odd way to take a stand against social injustice, but few people fully 
understand exactly what they are sipping from their disposable plastic bottles. The issues associated with 
bottled water and the privatization of water in gen-
eral far exceed those of roadside litter and landfills.
The environmental issues surrounding bottled 
water are nothing new. Plastic bottles are made from a by-product of refining oil and, when accompanied with the gasoline used to transport the bottles from one place to another, give bottled water a huge car -
bon footprint. Also, only 25 percent of plastic bottles are recycled, sending the rest to landfills, incinerators 
and waterways, according to Food & Water Watch.
One issue students may find particularly hard 
to swallow is the effect that water privatization has 
on human rights in our global community. Buying bottled water supports international companies that have succeeded in privatizing all municipal water in Third World countries. The privatization of Bolivian water has led to an increase of water prices. Many Bo-
livians cannot afford the price 
increase, and there have been 
mass riots across the nation.
In addition to hurting the 
global water system, buying bottled water supports unjust 
efforts right here at home. Several towns in our coun-try have had their municipal water sources claimed and bottled by big companies like Nestlé, Coca-Cola Co. and PepsiCo Inc. Even during times of drought, 
these Americans are forced to buy what used to be a 
free resource. Even as they grow thirsty, the compa-nies continue to bottle.
In a survey administered to the American Univer -
sity community in October 2012, one student posed the argument that purchasing bottled water is every-one’s right. In response, students declared our free-doms only extend until they infringe on the rights of others. Everyone has a right to clean, safe drinking 
water. This freedom should not be sacrificed for our 
luxury of drinking from disposable bottles while our sinks are filled with safer, cleaner water.
The most common misconception about bottled 
water is its superiority to tap water. Nationally, tap water is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency under the Safe Drinking Water Act and is held to higher standards for safety than bottled wa-ter, which is regulated as a food product by the Food 
and Drug Administration. Additionally, the FDA 
gives the responsibility for safety checks directly to the bottled water companies, which are not legally required to release this information.
Also, plastic water bottles contain PETs, a chemi-
cal that is linked with cancer and reproductive issues. PETs begin to leak from the bottle and into the water instantly. The chemicals leak into the water increas-ingly due to the duration and temperature at which 
the bottle is kept. Ironic that the labels wrapped 
around those bottles read “pure,” “clean” and “natu-ral.”
Water is life, and life shouldn’t be privatized.Samantha Kenny is a columnist for The Eagle at

An ordinary dress would 
never work for Slaviana Ste-
fanova.
The UF psychology and po-
litical science sophomore had 
planned a dinner date with 
her boyfriend to celebrate their two-year anniversary.
She could settle for a plain 
dress pulled off the racks from a local department store, she could spend a fortune for a de-signer creation, or she could by-pass the decision entirely.
As a campus representative 
for the web-based company Rent the Runway , Stefanova, 20, knew there was a way for her to look great while on a budget.
According to the company’s 
website, Rent the Runway is an online service that allows mem-
bers to rent designer dresses, 
jewelry and accessories for up to 90 percent off retail prices.
Prices and designers vary , 
but most items are available for $50 to $200 for a four-day or eight-day rental. The eight-day rental costs a little extra, though. Two different sizes of 
the same dress are sent before 
the event in case one doesn’t fit, and it’s free to return them by mail, Stefanova said.
Industrial and systems engi-
neering sophomore and man-ager of the UF representative team Ashley Papagno said most college-aged women do not 
have a lot of money to buy ex-pensive clothes or have space in 
tiny apartments to store dresses they may only wear once.
She said these reasons make 
Rent the Runway both an eco-nomical and practical service for students.
“It’s like online shopping, 
but it doesn’t haunt you,” Pa-pagno, 19, said.
UF’s team of campus rep-
resentatives promotes Rent the 
Runway by hosting events like 
trunk shows and advertising through social media websites.
Paige Gross, a 19-year-old 
recreation and event manage-ment sophomore at UF, is a manager for the team. She said using social media will encour -
age more young women to take 
advantage of the company.
UF representatives for the 
company spread awareness 
through their Facebook page. By liking the Rent the Runway at UF page, students can receive 
promotional codes.
In April, the team promoted 
its Gainesville Fashion Week 
show by posting pictures of the models on websites like Twit-ter, Instagram and Pinterest.
Jennie Clark, a 21-year-old 
advertising senior, said she thinks the web-based platform of Rent the Runway and the use of social media to promote the company has played a large 
role in its success.
Papagno said social media 
helps make the Rent the Run-
way experience more relatable.
“It’s definitely an advantage 
over other online stores because . . . you have actual girls who share how the dress fits, specifi-cally down to the details,” she 
said.Rent the Runway at

Two Gainesville organizations 
are collecting donated coats and 
jackets as the weather grows colder.
Crystal Air & Water Inc., a 
Gainesville-based heating and air 
conditioning company, is having its 
annual coat drive, said spokeswom-an Tricia Garzon.
Clothing can be dropped off at 
Crystal Air’s office, at 1611 NW 55th Place off Highway 441 and across from Home Depot. People can also give the items to Crystal Air work-ers when they see one of the organi-
zation’s vehicles, she said.
The business is accepting gently 
used items for people of any age or 
gender, but it is specifically inter -
ested in youth coats and jackets be-cause children outgrow their cloth-ing quickly, Garzon said.
Crystal Air collects the coats all 
year, but it emphasizes the drive in the colder months, she said.
“We’re getting into the season 
when people will need these jackets 
and coats,” Gar -
zon said.
Crystal Air has 
donated about 1,000 pieces of clothing since starting the drive several years ago, she said.
Kirk Smith, 
the owner and president of Crystal 
Air & Water Inc., began the project 
because he wanted to help the com-munity, she said.
Crystal Air is among a few or -ganizations having coat drives this season. The Salvation Army will be distributing coats throughout the winter, said Pamela Rivera, com-munity development director of the Gainesville Salvation Army.
Homeless individuals and oth-
ers with financial need can receive vouchers to select coats and other 
clothing items from the charity’s 
thrift store, said Lt. Karen Lewis, corps officer of the Gainesville Sal-vation Army.
The charity gave out 204 articles 
of clothing in October and about 200 in September, Lewis said.
She said it’s important for com-
munity members to realize their 
clothing can be reused for a good 
cause.
“Everybody has the right to have 
clothing,” Lewis said.Winter coat collections combat the cold

�MORRISON FORCED A KEY 
FUMBLE IN FLORIDA’S WIN 
AGAINST FSU ON SATURDAY.
  JOSH JURNOVOY
 Alligator Staff Writer
   
 When Antonio Morrison has 
played, the results have been 
promising. Coach Will Muschamp is expecting them to only get bet-
ter.
  The freshman linebacker will 
take the place of junior linebacker 
Jelani Jenkins on the depth chart. 
Jenkins underwent surgery on 
Monday to repair a broken bone in his right foot. 
Jenkins suffered the injury in 
Saturday’s win against Florida State and will likely miss Florida’s 
bowl game. 
  “It’s huge for a young player to take steps forward,” Muschamp said.
  Muschamp used sophomore 
cornerback Loucheiz Purifoy as 
an example of a player who  ben-eﬁ  tted from an experience simi-lar to Morrison’s when he was a 
freshman. 
  Purifoy mainly played special 
teams in 2011, but when Marcus 
Roberson suffered a neck injury after starting the season’s ﬁ  rst 10 games, Purifoy stepped into his spot prior to the Gator Bowl against Ohio State.
  After getting all of Roberson’s 
ﬁ  rst-team reps throughout the 
bowl practices, Purifoy played 
increased snaps against the Buck-eyes and recorded ﬁ  ve tackles and a forced fumble.
  Muschamp said on Monday 
that bowl practices would begin  Freshman linebacker 
expected to see larger role after early success

 After a fractured right thumb and a 
hamstring injury kept linebacker Jelani 
Jenkins out of three games this season, 
a broken ﬁ  fth metatarsal will keep him 
out of Florida’s bowl game. He under-went surgery on Monday morning and is expected to be out four to six weeks.
  “(He) should be ﬁ  ne,” coach Will 
Muschamp said. 
  Jenkins recorded two tackles and an 
interception before leaving UF’s game 
against Florida State on Saturday. 
  Aside from Jenkins, Muschamp said 
Florida is relatively healthy heading 
into a probable appearance in the Sugar 
Bowl on Jan. 2.
  Guard Ian Silberman (torn labrum), 
safety De’Ante Saunders (undisclosed) 
and Jenkins are expected to sit out post-season play due to injury.
  Muschamp expects linebacker Nei-ron Ball, who is nursing an ankle in-
jury, to play. Quarterback Jeff Driskel 
and center Jonotthan Harrison are each wearing a walking boot because of an-kle injuries, but Muschamp said they 
should both be ﬁ  ne.
  Muschamp is hopeful defensive 
tackle Leon Orr (kidney infection) will 
return to physical activity during the week.
  
  Coaching search: Since Aubrey Hill resigned in August, the Gators have been 
using graduate assis-
tant Bush Hamdan at 
wide receivers coach. 
  Now, Muschamp 
is looking for a permanent solution at the position. He said he has a long list of candidates he plans to reach out to.

  When No. 1 Notre Dame takes the ﬁ  eld 
for the BCS National Championship Game in Miami on Jan. 7, a South-
eastern Conference team will be on the oppo-site sideline.
  However, the Fighting Irish should not be 
suiting up against Alabama or Georgia.
  Florida should be playing Notre Dame for 
the crystal football.
  Now before you go H.A.M. on my inbox 
and call me an idiot, just relax for a second.
  I’m not saying the Gators are necessarily 
better than the Crimson Tide. And as far as the Bulldogs are concerned, well, y’all saw what 
happened in Jacksonville on Oct. 27.
  But in this messed up, no-good joke of a 
postseason that the BCS forces upon college 
football every year, it’s all about the resume.
  And Florida has one hell of a body of work.  The ﬁ  rst item to consider is strength of 
schedule, and UF wins this three-way battle in a landslide that conjures up images of the vinegar-baking soda volcanoes we all used to 
make in elementary school.
  The Gators have defeated four teams cur-
rently ranked among the top 15 in the BCS 
standings. Two of those victories were fourth-quarter comebacks on the road.
  The ﬁ  rst rally came against Texas A&M and 
Heisman frontrunner Johnny Manziel. The sec-ond was against Florida State, the likely Atlan-tic Coast Conference champions.  The other two wins 
were dominant perfor-mances against top-10 squads at Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium. UF 
outmuscled and wore 
down LSU on the line of scrimmage. Two weeks later, the Gators 
punched Steve Spurrier and South Carolina in the mouth.
  Meanwhile, Alabama and Georgia have a 
combined 2-2 record against the top 15 teams in the BCS.
  Let’s branch out to the bigger picture by 
taking a look at the overall schedule for each team. Eight of Florida’s opponents this season are bowl eligible.
  In all, the Gators’ 12 opponents are 92-50 
this season, which averages out to 8-4.
  Only ﬁ  ve Georgia foes will be eligible to re-
ceive a bowl bid. That includes Georgia Tech, which will need to request a special exception 
once a likely defeat in the ACC Championship 
Game drops it to 6-7.
  Alabama boasts a more respectable slate 
with six bowl-eligible opponents, but take into consideration that its opposite-division draws were Tennessee and Missouri.
  Georgia nabbed Ole Miss and Auburn, and 
Florida got stuck with Texas A&M and LSU. UF deserves spot in title game

“[Young players] need to cherish this 
opportunity they’ve got sitting in front of 
them,” Muschamp said of the bowl prac-tices. 
“It’s another spring ball, another oppor -
tunity to improve yourself as a player, and 
it helps our football team.”
Morrison made an impact against the 
Seminoles shortly after stepping into Jen-
kins’ spot.  
With Florida trailing 20-16 during Flor -
ida State’s first possession of the fourth 
quarter, Morrison leveled FSU quarterback 
EJ Manuel and forced a fumble that was re-covered by Dominique Easley. On the next play, Mike Gillislee ran 37 yards for a touch-down that put the Gators up for good.
Jenkins said he was happy his freshman 
backup had a good showing in his place.
“It’s a great feeling,” Jenkins said. “I’m 
glad we got depth at all positions. I got complete confidence in everybody that is behind me. It’s something I expect. It’s nothing out of the world for him to make a big play. He’s a big playmaker.”
Morrison ranks eighth on the team with 
31 tackles this season. 
While Morrison played in every game 
prior to Saturday, he had made just two starts. In four separate games, Morrison did 
not record a tackle.  
Despite the sporadic playing time, de-
fensive tackle Omar Hunter saw Morrison’s 
ability.
“[Morrison] is physical,” Hunter said. “I 
don’t know if he knows anything else, but 
he is physical. That’s the one thing he does. That’s just his makeup. He is a physical football player, and he’s very smart, too.”
Morrison was the 204th-ranked player in 
the class of 2012, according to Rivals.com. 
However, Muschamp said the coaching 
staff valued Morrison’s talent.
“Antonio is a very instinctive, tough, 
physical player,” Muschamp said. 
“He is a guy that tackles well. He enjoys 
the physical contact of the game. … That was something that we saw. D.J. [Durkin] went up a spring ago and watched him work out and saw his work ethic and his toughness and what he was about, and we knew he was the type of guy we wanted in our program. Very, very pleased that he is 
here.”

port any UF assistant who has an op-
portunity to take a better job somewhere else, adding that he does not expect any 
staff changes to take place. 
Gators expect a trip to New Orleans:   
After UF defeated Florida State and 
Notre Dame held off USC on Saturday, 
Florida’s bowl picture became clearer.
Muschamp met with athletic director 
Jeremy Foley on Monday and discussed the Gators’ postseason fate.
“He just said it looked like the Sugar 
Bowl,” Muschamp said. “Nothing for sure until Sunday night, but that’s what it looks like.”
The Sugar Bowl takes place on Jan. 2 
at the Superdome in New Orleans. 
Although the Gators are out of na-
tional title contention, their bowl oppo-nent has yet to be determined. Confer -ence championship games take place on Saturday.
“I’ll watch a game, but we’re going to 
be recruiting,” Muschamp said. “That’s the most important thing that we need to do.”
Muschamp responds to Saban: Alabama 
coach Nick Saban shared his thoughts about Florida’s path to the Sugar Bowl in a teleconference on Sunday.
No. 2 Alabama plays No. 3 Georgia 
on Saturday for the Southeastern Confer -
ence title and a spot in the BCS National Championship Game.
The loser will likely fall behind Flori-
da and play in a non-BCS bowl. 
“It’s not really a great scenario,” Sa-
ban said on Sunday. “You play your way into the (SEC) championship game, which means you’re the best team in 
your division. … It doesn’t seem quite 
right, but it is what it is. I don’t really know what me commenting about it is going to do to change it. But I don’t feel good about it.”
Alabama defeated LSU 21-0 in last 
year’s BCS National Championship Game despite not playing in the SEC Championship Game.
Muschamp worked under Saban at 
LSU and in the NFL with the Miami Dol-phins.
The top four teams automatically 
play in a BCS bowl unless a conference 
already has two teams qualify. Florida 
would be the second team, but Mus-champ wouldn’t mind a different sce-nario.
“Well, I can switch and go to Atlanta 
if he doesn’t want to go to Atlanta and play the ‘Dawgs,” Muschamp said. “Be careful what you ask for, Nick.”

NOTES , from page 13
The average opponent the Crimson Tide 
and the Bulldogs faced this season was 6-6.
 Regardless of schedule, each team took 
care of business like great teams do. But 
how did each squad fare in its one bad 
game?
In other words, who has the best loss?
Again, Florida wins with little contest.The Crimson Tide fell flat on their 
trunks from the get-go and had no answer for Manziel and the Aggies, falling behind 20-0 in a 29-24 defeat on Nov. 10 at Bryant-Denny Stadium. Alabama let a freshman quarterback take over Tuscaloosa like it 
was nothing.
At least Georgia’s loss came on the 
road to a top-10 team, but the positivity 
ends there. The Gamecocks destroyed the Bulldogs, jumping out to a 21-0 lead in the first quarter and surrendering UGA’s lone touchdown with 1:55 left to play — garbage time.UF’s loss — albeit to Georgia — was a 
one-score defeat at a neutral site. While the game was an anomaly for both teams, Flor -
ida was competitive from wire to wire.
The Gators clearly have a better claim 
than both the Bulldogs and the Crimson 
Tide to play for it all in Miami. The one ob-
stacle in UF’s way is its failure to win the SEC.
But even with a win in the SEC title 
game, Alabama and Georgia still play sec-ond fiddle to Florida when it comes to the overall resume.
Conference championships simply do 
not matter in the big picture anymore.
Just ask the Crimson Tide, who won last 
year’s national title despite not playing in the SEC Championship Game. The Fighting 
Irish are the nation’s top-ranked team, and 
the school is an independent in football.
The BCS is egregious, offensive and un-
fair.
When UF is left on the outside looking 
in, it certainly won’t be the first deserv-ing school shafted by the system. Auburn should have advanced ahead of Oklahoma in 2004, and Texas should have played Florida for the national title instead of Okla-
homa in 2008.
Frankly , all three of the SEC’s one-loss 
teams should be part of an eight-team play-off to determine the national champion, but 
that would make sense and people would be happy.
The BCS doesn’t exist to produce an 
honest and deserving champion. It’s short-sighted.
Luckily, this whole sham will be re-
vamped in 2014, and we won’t have to worry about which two teams are the most deserving. More contenders will earn a le-gitimate shot.
But as long as we’re forced to pick only 
two teams to play for the national title, it might as well be the squads that have per -
formed the best against elite competition.
This year, those teams are Notre Dame 
and Florida.

 � FLORIDA LEADS THE NCAA 
IN TWO-POINT SHOOTING PERCENTAGE DEFENSE. 
KATIE AGOSTIN
Alligator Staff Writer
 
After Florida’s 58-40 win against 
Savannah State on Nov. 20, coach 
Billy Donovan praised UF’s defense. 
On Friday, Donovan’s admiration had faded. 
Despite holding UCF to 38.5 
percent shooting in the first half, 
Florida’s defense let up in the sec-
ond half, allowing a 57.1 percent clip 
from the field. The Knights shot 80 
percent behind the three-point line. 
“Our energy (and) our effort de-
fensively in the first half enabled 
us to turn them over, enabled us to 
get the fast break (and) enabled us to play really, really fast,” Donovan said following Florida’s 79-66 win. 
“The second half was a completely 
opposite half for us. … Our effort in the first half in relationship to the 
second half was night and day.”
Still, the Gators boast the top two-
point percentage defense in the na-
tion, holding opponents to just 33.9 percent shooting inside the arc. 
Prior to Friday’s game, Florida 
held opponents to 31 percent shoot-ing. Even after allowing UCF to shoot 46.8 percent from the field, UF ranks ninth nationally with a 33.7 
opponent shooting percentage. 
Florida has also excelled at scor -
ing off of turnovers. 
The Gators have forced 83 turn-
overs and racked up 95 points off of turnovers in five games. Those 95 
points account for 26.3 percent of 
UF’s scoring output this season. 
Junior Scottie Wilbekin has spear -
headed the Gators’ takeaway effort. 
The point guard has only seen action 
in three games, but he already leads 
Florida with eight steals. 
“I love getting steals,” Wilbekin 
said. “I love playing defense, maybe 
more than I love playing offense. 
That’s just who I am.”
Donovan added: “He really, re-
ally, really defends, and I really trust him out there defensively. … His 
first two years of his career, he has 
not tried to score. He’s been more 
of a facilitator. He’s been more of a 
guy who’s just been a lockdown de-
fender.”
Although the Gators struggled 
with two-point defense on Friday, 
Donovan is focused on the team’s ability to guard beyond the arc. 
Florida ranked last in the South-
eastern Conference in 2011-12 by allowing opponents to make 39.7 
percent of their three-point attempts in SEC games. But the Gators are 
showing signs of improvement early this season, ranking sixth in the SEC 
by allowing 33.3 percent.
“We really have tried to make a 
focus on it, and our guys have done 
a good job to their credit up to this point and time,” Donovan said.
Although the Gators have already 
seen improvements in shooting 
percentage, the team’s rebounding 
numbers have not changed much 
from last season. 
Donovan was worried about 
Florida’s ability to rebound coming 
into the season, saying the effort on the glass in UF’s exhibition game against Nebraska-Kearney was not 
good enough. Since then, the Gators 
have grabbed 70.7 percent of their 
defensive rebounding opportunities, 
which ranks 94th in the nation. Last season, Florida grabbed 69.7 percent 
of its opportunities, finishing 88th in 
the nation.
Donovan is confident UF will 
continue to progress this season.
“We have a lot of room for im-
provement and we got to get a lot 
better,” Donovan said. “That being 
said, it is still November. And I think we’ve played a lot of games against a lot of different styles which has 
been healthy. It’s been good.”
