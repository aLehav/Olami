A member ofthe UF Board of Trust-
ees has donated $2 million to depart-
ment of chemistry.
The donation will endow a profes-
sorship to help UF scientists develop advancements that will improve health care, according to statement re-leased Monday. 
Dr. Steven Scott and his wife, Re-
becca, hope the gift, which will fund the hiring of a new professor, will bolster the university’s department of chemistry.

UF alumnus and Olympic gold medalist Steve Mesler, left, smiles as UF sophomore Christopher 
Howard does pushups to demonstrate a point about hypertrophy at Hough Hall on Monday.

The audience was silent while 
Steve Mesler talked about the moment 
that changed his life. 
He had just graduated from UF’s 
College of Health and Human Perfor -
mance, and he was looking back at an 
athletic career that, due to consecutive 
injuries, had gone nowhere. 
Ten years later, he found himself 
on the podium at the 2010 Winter 
Olympics with his fellow bobsledding 
teammates and a gold medal around 
his neck. 
How did he do it?Mesler said an intense feeling of 
failure fueled his success, and any-
body can take those feelings and turn 
them around for the better.
This is what his presentation, The 
Science of Success, was all about. 
Designed by Mesler and his friend 
Jayson Krause, the program talks about how to take one’s personal and professional success through the stag-es of failure, rebuilding, practicing 
and believing. 
It uses the science of an Olympic 
athlete’s physical training and relates it to the social and mental realities of 
everyday life, according to Krause. Krause, of Calgary, Alberta, is a 
former member of the Canadian bob-sledding team and has been a Success 
Coach with the company Driven By 
Passion Inc. for four years. 
The two men presented their pro-
gram to a group of about 30 students 
and staff members Monday morning 
in Hough Hall. 
To keep things interesting, they 
used a juggling exercise with two ran-dom students to stress the importance of practicing a skill. One student also 
came up to do a pushup test to help 
demonstrate a point about pushing one’s limits. 
“We’ve turned this into something 
we feel like we can help people with,” Mesler said.
The program has three steps: first, 
how to push oneself to the limit and recover from failure; second, how to 
acquire skills in one’s chosen field 
through practice and repetition; and Olympic bobsledder gives motivational talk

No one will be laughing in 
the O’Connell Center Friday night.
Comedian Dane Cook has 
canceled his performance, 
citing “recent personal mat-
ters” as his reason for the cancellation.
Cook also canceled his 
other performances on his 
Florida tour, which would 
have been in  Tallahassee, Tampa and West Palm Beach, according to a press release 
on his website.“I appreciate all the sup-
port from my fans in Florida, 
and I promise you all that I will be back soon,” Cook said in a statement. 
Those seeking refunds for 
their tickets 
can get their money back by returning 
to the place 
where they p u rc h a s e d them, ac-
cording to 
the release.
A notice on Ticketmaster’s 
website told people that the money will be automatically refunded to students who 
purchased tickets through the site.
O’Connell Center repre-
sentatives said they had no additional information.
The canceled Florida dates 
were scheduled to kick off the tour. 
The tour will instead be-
gin in Syracuse, N.Y., on Oct. 26. 
The Associated Press re-
ported last week that Cook’s half-brother, Darryl McCau-ley, pleaded guilty to embez-zling money from Cook’s ac-count. 
He was sentenced to up to 
six years in prison.Cook cancels O’Dome stop

About 750 Alachua County 
voters cast their ballots on the 
first day of early voting Monday.  
“Early voting is getting off to a good 
start,” said Pam Carpenter, supervi-sor of elections for Alachua County.
Carpenter said she expects ballots 
to start slowly coming in larger num-bers.
Three sites are designated for 
early voting: the Millhopper Branch Library, the Tower Road Branch Li-
brary and the County Administration 
Building.
Carpenter estimated that up to 40 
percent of voters in the county will vote early this year in person or with an absentee bal-
lot. 
In the last governor’s race in 
2006, only about 19 percent of those who voted had voted early.  
Carpenter said more people are in-Voters begin casting

To catch the attention of students, the Office 
of Sustainability is seeking to reach students and 
promote awareness of alternative forms of trans-
portation through social media and Web use.
The Office of Sustainability is using means 
such as Facebook and Twitter to create awareness 
of different forms of transportation for students such as walking, biking or taking a bus. 
“Students are an impossible nut to crack in 
terms of getting their attention,” said Ashley Pennington, outreach coordinator for the office. “Social media is a huge, viral way of reaching 
[students] in ways that traditional marketing 
might not.” 
The Office of Sustainability has teamed up 
with Gainesville’s Regional Transit System to promote these alternative forms of transporta-tion.
Chip Skinner, marketing and communications 
supervisor for RTS, said the use of social media and the Internet were huge for the company. 
“We use [our Facebook] as an informational 
source,” Skinner said. “We continuously try to post at least two things a week out there.” 
Skinner saw the positive effects of media us-
age when RTS recently redesigned its website. The newly designed website produced a record-high 4.75 million hits in the month of August, as 
compared to its previous average of 36,000 hits 
per month. 
Charlene Ochogo, a freshman at UF, has no-
ticed the efforts of the Office of Sustainability. Pointing to an e-mail from the office regarding the One Less Car Challenge, a promotion from 
the office that focuses on alternative transporta-
tion, Ochogo believes the campaign is effective.
“I thought it was really cool,” she said. “I was 
like, ‘Hey, I’m going to be a part of this.’” Sustainability office gets

In honor of the International 
Day for the Eradication of Poverty, 
members of the UF chapter of the 
international nonprofit group One 
will sell BeadforLife jewelry on the Plaza of the Americas from 10 a.m. 
to 2 p.m Wednesday.
The jewelry, made from recy-
cled magazines by the women of Uganda, will range from $5 to $30 
depending on the style.
All profits from the sales of the 
necklaces, bracelets, earrings, jew-elry bags and more will be sent di-rectly to the  women and children of 
Uganda. While some of the money 
will be directed toward education and shelter, a portion of that mon-
ey will be put toward health care 
and HIV testing for children.
Since April, members have col-lected more than 500 signatures on the petition to increase funding 
for those diseases so that no child 
would be born with AIDS by 2015, according to Domonique Worship, 
UF chapter president.
Noelle Sullivan, an instructor 
for the Human Sexuality and Cul-ture course at UF who has  trav-
eled to Africa,  said that although global funding is important in the 
fight against AIDS, the real challenge is mak-ing the monetary do-
nations effective.
“We have this idea that we want 
to fix everything,” Sullivan said. “And it’s a lofty goal, but a good 
one.”
While she acknowledges that 
there is still much more work to be done, Sullivan believes that more education can change the way peo-
ple perceive the disease.Beads to benefit Uganda

Holding a two-inch fish, Larry 
Page runs his thumb along the yel-
low skin beneath its eye. 
Peering through his glasses, he 
looks for a structure called a subor -
bital flap. 
It’s not there. He flips through a book compiled 
by other experts, then turns back to the fish. Running his thumb beneath its eye again, he smiles. 
“Ahhhh.”The fish is a new species — a 
specimen from Thailand that is sub-
tly yet vitally different from similar 
fishes.
Page, an ichthyologist — one 
who studies fish — at UF has re-ceived more than $7 million from the U.S. National Science Founda-tion’s Planetary Biodiversity Inven-tory to travel the world in search of undiscovered fish species.
To some, a tiny fish in Thailand 
isn’t much of a marvel. But to un-derstand an ecosystem, you have to understand those little critters. It’s like watching an orchestra or a football game, Page said. You can’t understand what’s going on if you don’t know what each musician or player is doing. 
“Everybody’s using oxygen from 
plants. They’re eating plants and animals. Everything is about biodi-
versity ,” he said. “What amazes me 
is that we keep having to explain this to people.“I’m sort of at a stage in my life 
where I think I should be pulling things together.”
Page worked for years at the Uni-
versity of Illinois, his alma mater, as 
a professor and as director of the 
Center for Biodiversity at the Illinois Natural History Survey . He later joined the NSF.  
He retired to Florida in 2002 but 
couldn’t keep away from the lab.
When the position for curator of 
fishes at UF’s Florida Museum of Natural History opened up in 2003, 
Page promised to fill in for a year or 
two without pay . He only recently began getting paid regularly for his work.
It wasn’t long after joining the 
museum that he snagged an even bigger responsibility: principal in-vestigator for a $4.7 million NSF grant to discover catfish species throughout the world.
From 2003 to 2009, Page and col-
laborators discovered and described 500 species. As research continues, 
he expects the grant’s impact to 
reach 1,000 new species. 
“It was a huge success,” Page 
said. “The fact that we got a second one is proof of that.” 
Page has been kicked out of more 
rivers than he can count. He’s even been threatened at gunpoint — twice in Tennessee and once in Texas. 
While in Sumatra for the catfish 
grant, he traveled to a small river to collect fish. It’s customary to seek permission from a village’s leader, but Page and his team were in a rush.  After about 15 minutes, Page heard screaming coming from the village. Twenty short angry men were headed his way . 
Page felt a hand clench his T-shirt 
and yank. He was dragged from the river.  He was too outnumbered to fight back. And now the angry men were carrying rocks. 
While he, his American colleague 
and a female Indonesian researcher were left relatively unharmed, he had to watch as the male Indonesian 
researchers were punched on the 
head.  Once their attackers calmed down, they allowed Page and his team to keep their fish but warned them to leave. They didn’t want strangers fishing in their waters. 
Page is just starting research for 
his newest grant, but he has already 
discovered a few species of cyprini-
formes. One that gained recent at-tention is Lepidocephalichthys zep-pelini, or the “Zeppelin Loach.”
His colleague Justin Havird, now 
a student at Auburn University , thought a structure along its pecto-
ral fin resembled the double-necked 
guitar of Jimmy Page from Led Zep-pelin. While Page isn’t a fan of the band, he didn’t mind letting Havird name the fish. Page has named many others. 
It is one of the largest collections 
in North America, with about 2.2 million specimens housed in the 
wide, dimly lit room in Dickinson Hall. Page caught many of them 
himself. 
He will soon head to other nations 
in search of new fish. But when the traveling is done, Page will return to Florida, to his quiet lab with tiny crit-
ters no one has ever heard of.4, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, OCTOBER 19, 2010

UF professor uses millions in grant money to find fish� ITEMS ARE SHIPPED FROM OHIO.
By ALEXANDER KLAUSNER

UF students no longer have to leave their dorms 
to go grocery shopping.
Dormzy is an online grocery service that caters 
specifically to college students. 
The idea is to be a replacement for on-campus 
grocery stores, which are often overpriced and un-
derstocked, said CEO Chris Sammons.
The website began shipping to UF in September, 
after launching at the beginning of the fall semester.
“Our goal is to provide a fast, convenient and 
more affordable way to do your grocery shopping,” said Dormzy spokeswoman Brooke Lleonart. “It’s great for people who don’t have any transportation, and we save the freshmen in dorms the long walk with no car.” 
Items bought from the site are shipped from Co-
lumbus, Ohio, via FedEx, and take one or two busi-
ness days to arrive.
Because the items ordered have to be shipped, 
foods that have to be refrigerated are not available 
through Dormzy.
The site sells more than just groceries, as well. It 
has toiletry items such as body wash and deodorant, along with other items such as pain medications and laundry detergent. In addition to selling these items, the site also has 
care packages, or bundles of items that are geared toward a specific occasion. 
For example, their “Good Luck on Exams” care 
package is filled with energy-related items like Red Bull, Monster, 5 Hour Energy, snacks and easy-to-make foods like ramen noodles. 
The site started out selling 600 items and has been 
constantly expanding, Sammons said.
Dormzy’s prices are typically 20 to 40 per -
cent cheaper than on-campus convenience stores, Lleonart said. 
Comparing prices at Provisions On Demand, the 
store on the ground floor of the Reitz Union — the price for Campbell’s Chunky soup is $3.79, whereas the price on Dormzy for the same item is $2.79. 
However, the same type of Bounty paper towels 
that are available on the site are available in the Flor -
ida Bookstore for cheaper. 
Dormzy also caters to non-students. Lleonart said that people fresh out of college and 
even the elderly have used the service.
However, if the name wasn’t evidence enough, 
Sammons said the site was designed for college stu-dents.
“We’re all young here,” he said.”We all under -
stand college students. We’re not a bunch of people back here in suits trying to rip college students off. 
We just want it to be convenient and affordable to 
all students.”Website brings food to dorms
Business students made up most of the audience at the speech
third, how to believe one can continue to change for the bet-
ter. 
Naderge Bissainthe, a fourth-year finance major,  said she 
found the presentation to be relevant to her major.  
She said practice and repetition helped her make it through some of her more difficult classes. 
“It was really hard for me to understand what I was do-
ing and why I was doing it,” she said. “But it really becomes second nature.”
The event was open to anybody, but busi-
ness students occupied most of the seats.
The target audience, according to Mesler, is the business world. They’ve already worked with big names, such as MassMutual Financial Group. 
Dr. John Banko, of the Warrington College of Business 
Administration, organized the visit. He said this approach to life is different from what students learn in their classes. 
“What will make you happy in life is very different from 
what we teach here,” Banko said.MESLER , from page 1

at the corner of

versity Avenue. 
Services are held 
every Sunday at 
9 a.m. and 
11 a.m.
Oct. 30 is the last 
day to vote early
terested in early voting because it allows them to 
select a time that fits into their schedule.
And having enough time may be a particular 
concern to voters this year because this year’s ballot consists of about two dozen races, six constitutional 
amendments, six county amendments, one citizen 
initiative ordinance and one opinion poll. The bal-lot consists of two 18-inch-long pages.
“I expected people to make a lot of mistakes 
because it’s such a big ballot,” said Lloyd Smith, a clerk for the supervisor of elections.
The number of races on the ballot depends on a 
voter’s address. For example, people who live in State House District 23 
will not have a district race because 
incumbent democrat Chuck Chest-
nut is running unopposed. But people who live in Archer or High Springs will have an additional race.
The six state constitutional amendments, which 
were placed on the ballot by the state legislature or a statewide citizen petition, cover issues like land use, redistricting and education. 
The six county charter amendments include 
an amendment limiting municipal power and an amendment to replace the board of county com-missioners with a board of charter commissioners. 
Carpenter said she hopes that upcoming public 
events near the downtown voting site, such as the the Gainesville Pride Festival, will bring in more early voters. Early V oting is open Mondays through Fridays, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays from 9 a.m. to 1 
p.m.;  Sundays from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m.; and on the last 
day of early voting, Saturday, Oct. 30 until 5 p.m.

The Gator Nation will have 
representation at the inaugural 
USA Science & Engineering Fes-
tival this week in Washington, D.C.
The festival, which is being held in the greater Washington, D.C., area, will finish the week-end of Oct. 23 and 24 with an Expo on the National Mall that 
will feature booths from about 
500 organizations, including about 50 universities.
Ruth Kiefer, festival co-direc-
tor, said the main goal of the fes-tival is to inspire elementary and high school students to pursue careers in the sciences.
She said 
most universi-ties report be-tween 60 and 80 
percent of advanced science and 
engineering degrees are going to foreign students who often have 
to leave the country once they complete their education due to visa restrictions.
“We’re educating a bunch of 
wonderful scientists and engi-neers and not letting them stay,” she said.
According to a release, UF’s 
booth will feature a gyro-chair spin and a gyroscope game, in addition to small telescope build-ing.
UF spokesman Steve Orlando 
said the festival and UF’s partici-pation is indicative of a positive investment in the future.
“I think it’s fantastic that so 
much recognition is being given to science and engineering be-cause those are areas innovations will come from that will help take 
our economy to the next level,” 
he said.

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
RIVERSIDE, Calif. — A federal judge said 
on Monday that she is learning toward deny-
ing a government request to delay her order halting the military from enforcing its ban on 
openly gay troops.
U.S. District Judge Virginia Phillips said 
she would review the arguments from Jus-
tice Department lawyers and issue a ruling as early as Monday, or by Tuesday.
“My tentative ruling is to deny the appli-
cation for a stay,” Phillips said at the start of the hearing.
Phillips said the government has not 
proven that her order would harm troops 
or in any way impede efforts to implement 
new regulations for the military to deal with 
openly gay service members.
If she rejects the request, Justice Depart-ment officials say the Obama administration 
would appeal. 
Experts say they will likely find friendlier 
venues in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 
9th Circuit in San Francisco 
and, ultimately, the U.S. Su-preme Court.
“The farther the deci-
sion gets from the presenta-
tion of evidence in the trial 
court, the more likely it is 
that courts will assume the military must have some 
critically important interest at stake,” said 
Diane Mazur, a law professor who opposes 
the policy.
The military has promised to abide by 
the injunction against the “don’t ask, don’t 
tell” policy as long as her order remained in 
place.Judge likely to deny gov’t

Office is searching for a man who 
pistol-whipped a Walgreens phar -
macist and made off with Oxycon-
tin and Adderall.
At about 11 a.m. on Sunday, the 
suspect walked  into the Walgreens 
at 7520 W. Newberry Rd. and head-
ed straight to the pharmacy counter, according to Alachua County Sher -
iff’s Office spokesman Art Forgey.
The man hopped over the coun-
ter, approached the only pharmacist on duty and struck him behind his 
right ear with what is believed to be 
a handgun, Forgey said.
The man demanded the drugs 
and left on foot as soon as he got 
what he wanted. The crime was 
caught on video surveillance.
The man is described as white 
with brown hair and light facial hair, of medium build, between the 
ages of 20 and 40 years old, and 
wearing blue jeans, a black- and yellow-striped long sleeve shirt, a red baseball cap and white tennis 
shoes.
Anyone with information re-
garding the suspect or the crime is 
asked to call Detective Sandra My-ers at 352-367-4083.Man robs Walgreens

Columnist examines sports gender roles
This football season has been creating excellent op-
portunities to examine the role of women in male locker rooms, but the way the NFL backpedaled 
from a series of teachable moments is both superficial and predictable.
The tough questions don’t make any money and sex 
sells — regardless of the transactional cost on our society.
The main thrust of a global business is penetrating 
new markets, and nobody thrusts and penetrates like the NFL. 
By the way, have you seen the new line of women’s 
team gear Touch by Alyssa Milano  exclusively sold on 
nfl.com?  
I’m personally holding off my purchase until it makes 
a Cleveland Browns thong in my size.
The first time the NFL stepped into a steaming pile of 
controversy involving the representation of women in 
sports and society, a Hispanic woman named Ines Sainz was treated like a sex object by a number of New York Jets players.  
Ines Sainz is paid to do one thing, and that one thing 
is wearing really tight pants on camera.  Her job is to be a sex object.
While not quite wearing the full-fledged whore uni-
form, Sainz was dressed provocatively enough to unwit-
tingly become the most famous butter face in the fight for 
sexual equality since Susan B. Anthony. 
The NFL, though, stiff-armed any substantive discus-
sion with a barrage of press conferences and apologies demonizing a bunch of guys who acted somewhat disre-
spectfully toward a pretty girl flaunting her body to get 
ahead in the world.
In other news involving the Jets’ sexual harassment, Brett Favre tried wooing profes-sional fame whore Jenn Sterger with romantic text messages starring his 
40-something old man pigskin while 
he was playing in New York. 
Sterger, who rose to prominence 
by flashing her fake boobs at nation-
ally televised Florida State Univer -
sity games in a historically inaccu-
rate and racially insensitive “slutty Seminole maiden” 
costume, was working at the time for the Jets as an on-air personality based on her extensive journalism experience 
earned by posing in Playboy.
A federal court had to step in and allow female report-
ers access to American locker rooms in 1977, making the 
areas underneath the stadium some of the most sexually 
segregated parts of our society. 
Whether or not women actually belong in a male lock-
er room, and how far they have to unfortunately exploit 
themselves to get there, has been up for debate ever since then. 
But this conversation is tough, and it involves far too 
much self-examination for a sport whose lifeblood is cheerleaders and beer commercials. 
We were all too happy to let the NFL drop the ball on 
this hornet’s nest of an issue. 
Instead of prying open our own deeply held delusions 
about outdated sexual roles and taking a closer look at exactly why pretty women have been attached to most sporting events, we left yet another battle to be fought by 
our modern-day gladiators. 
Tommy Maple is an international communications gradu-
ate student. His column appears every Tuesday.Hot As Ice
It’s not often we say this, 
but Nelly might be on par with Nostradamus. 
The Band-Aid-branding, 
smile-on-the-rocks-sporting 
lyrical wizard predicted ever 
so eloquently in 2002 that it was, indeed, getting “Hot in Herre.” So far this year, cli-matologists say 2010 has tied with 1998 for the record of being the hottest year. And while that might not come as much of a surprise to all of us 
airing our shirts out after sit-
ting down in class and blow-drying our armpit stains after walking around our house, we should all be alarmed by the irrefutable warming trend. 
Because it really is getting 
hot in here. 
With a temperature 1.17 
degrees Fahrenheit above the 20th century average, Septem-ber was the 305th consecutive month with a global tempera-ture soaring past the 20th cen-tury average, says the Nation-al Climatic Data Center.
And while 1.17 degrees 
seems like nothing while all of us are dealing with our still-beading-in-October forehead 
sweat, try telling that to the 
polar bears who are losing their ice sheets at an alarming rate. Or the mosquitoes run-ning rampant farther north during a greater part of the year due to warming. 
To these critters, 1.17 de-
grees can mean the difference 
between life and death. This 
year also saw the first time the City of Angels saw a hellish 113 degrees and the first time in history the Northwest Pas-sage was ice-free. 
So, skeptics, when you’re 
smugly enjoying leaving your energy-inefficient reading 
light on while your planet 
spontaneously combusts, don’t blame us. 
We’ll have already packed 
up the polar bears and fol-lowed Nelly to safety.Put that hoe down! Step away from the wandering stal-lion. And leave. Just leave that sad brown duckling in the pond. 
Abandon your farms; let your crops wither and die. Your In-
ternet security depends on it.
A Wall Street Journal investigation found the most popular 
Facebook applications, particularly the ones that clog up your news feed with 27 notifications in a row detailing your aunt’s successful virtual apple picking endeavors, have a sinister se-cret behind their deceiving facade of Himalayan kitties running amok down on the farm.
The Facebook applications, including FarmVille and Fron-
tierVille, have been found to leak personal information of their users to Internet tracking companies, even when privacy set-
tings are set to their strictest.
Which means even if you’ve blacked out your keg stand de-
fault picture to prevent your virtual gardening mom from seeing 
such debauchery and deleted your latest farming bounty from your news feed to prevent your friends from knowing you’ve been sucked into the farm fun, Internet tracking companies and online advertising giants can still access your information. 
This latest privacy woe for the social media superpower only 
further proves what we have long known. Not only is complete 
privacy on the Web impossible, but perhaps more disconcerting 
is that most people are indifferent to this fact.
We have reached a time when we value virtual entertain-
ment and connectedness over privacy . 
We’ve reached a time when we value a virtual bushel of ber -
ries more than our private lives. It’s time to choose, Gators. Do we value privacy or sad, lonely cyber ducklings more?
Choose wisely. Because we’ll probably delete you if we get 
one more invite to join your farming fun.Sowing Secrets

As students, we should each take the op-
portunity to learn a lesson of acceptance and civility from the recent tragedy at 
Rutgers University.
Here at UF, we know of the harm and disunity 
that can be brought about by unwillingness to ac-cept the differences that make us such a dynamic 
and diverse group of individuals. Even as recent-
ly as last month, we experienced the divisiveness brought about by the actions of the Dove World Outreach Center. Every day, we grapple with de-cisions that affect us and the people around us. 
Our words and, more importantly, our actions 
have a profound impact on one another. 
We should not take for granted the value of 
respecting each other’s 
backgrounds and cultures.
At UF, we must contin-
ue the great tradition that  
precedes us and strive to be open and accept-
ing of all people. From our multitude of cultural 
organizations to our strong commitment to pro-
viding every group of students with engaging programs to take part in, UF has shown itself to be a school devoted to fostering friendship and 
acceptance of others. Our experiences here have 
taught us it is imperative to learn from people whose backgrounds are different than our own and apply these lessons inside and outside of the classroom. 
With this tragedy at Rutgers still in mind, I 
want to encourage all students to hold each other to a higher standard and to learn that even the slightest insensitivity can bring about pain for 
others, whether it be intentional or not. 
We cannot allow such intolerance to cast a 
shadow upon the spirit and vibrance that is pres-
ent in our community. I urge you all to be civil, accepting and respectful of one another.

Speaking Out
People expect to hear accurate and fact-based information 
from the media, but according to recent research, that might not be what they’re getting.
Brian Weeks, a doctoral student in the Ohio State U. School 
of Communication, conducted a study on Barack Obama’s 
supposed Muslim beliefs, rumors of which surfaced during 
summer 2008.
“We wanted to see if there was a relationship between top-
ics discussed on the news and people’s information-seeking behavior,” Weeks said.
With Brian Southwell associate professor in journalism at U. 
Minnesota, Weeks examined news coverage of the rumor on seven major television networks: ABC, CBS, CNN, Fox, MSN-BC, NBC and PBS’s NewsHour with Jim Lehrer, and in about 
30 newspapers from all across the country , from June 1, 2008, 
through the Nov. 4 election.
“From this search, we were able to determine the amount of 
coverage on television and in newspapers for each day in our time period,” Weeks said. “Using Google Trends, we looked at the volume of online searches about the rumor conducted on Google for each day.”
By using statistical procedures, Weeks said they were able 
to assess the relationship between television and newspaper coverage and Internet searches of the rumor.
Their results suggested that television 
coverage and searches were significantly 
related. As the amount of television coverage of the rumor in-
creased, so did Google searches on that same day, Weeks said.
Reports by the Pew Research Center survey show that about 
18 percent of Americans believe Obama is a Muslim, Weeks 
said. OSU political science lecturer Charles Smith said there are more variables that come into play, and viewers need to con-sider numerous sources of information.
“The part about 18 percent (of Americans) believing Barack 
Obama was a Muslim, well you got more people believing Big Foot is real,” Smith said. “What are we listening to? Where are 
we getting that information? I’m betting it’s coming from Sean 
Hannity, Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh or right-winged radio.
“Not that there’s anything wrong with that, it’s political ex-
pression, but you’ve got to look at where people are getting their information.”
A university employee said he heard the Muslim rumor 
through the media and, as a result, began his own research.
“I heard people give their theories (about Obama). I heard 
someone say when he took an oath of office he swore on the Quran,” he said. “So I checked that.”
McCloskey said he verifies facts only when he feels they are 
inconsistent with previous knowledge.
Weeks said none of the broadcast networks said the rumor 
was true, but that didn’t matter.
“The argument that we were making was about the presen-
tation on TV ,” Weeks said. “If you think about the way a lot of these shows are shown, especially on cable, the format is one in which they bring on a pundit from one side of the political aisle, then another from the other side, and then throw out a question and let them debate.”
It was a debate that sparked Weeks’ research.“I was having a conversation, and we were talking about the 
election,” Weeks said. “It came out from a friend that Obama 
is Muslim, and everyone looked at him and asked where he 
heard that. He said, ‘Well, I saw it on TV .’”
However, TV isn’t the only medium credited for influencing 
the public.
“It can be movies, prime-time TV , rap songs. It can be any 
media. You have to widen up the definition of media to find out where people are getting their ideas from,” Smith said. “That’s why more people believe in Big Foot.”

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
COLUMBUS, Ohio — Heading 
into the homestretch of the mid-
term elections, President Barack Obama is targeting key Demo-cratic constituencies as he tries to 
energize voters and build up Elec-
tion Day turnout among his sup-porters.
The groups Obama is targeting 
mirror those that helped him win the White House: young people, African-Americans and women.
 A crucial element of the presi-
dent’s strategy in the two weeks 
before the Nov. 2 election is find-
ing a way to get first-time voters from 2008 to head back to the polls even though Obama’s name isn’t on the ballot.
Speaking before a lively crowd 
of 35,000 during a Sunday night rally on the campus of Ohio State University, the president sought 
to recapture the enthusiasm of 
his presidential campaign, urging Democrats not to give up in the face of polls predicting sweeping defeats for the party in November.
“You can defy the conventional 
wisdom, the kind that says you can’t overcome the cynicism of our politics,” Obama said, his voice 
hoarse from three straight days of 
campaigning.
The White House said Sunday’s 
crowd was the largest Obama had spoken to since his inauguration.
Obama was joined in Ohio by 
first lady Michelle Obama, their first joint campaign appearance since the presidential election. The first lady has been on a campaign swing of her own, putting a per -
sonal spin on the election.
“When I think about the is-
sues facing our nation right now, I think about what that means for our girls,” Mrs. Obama told the crowd.
The president has been blunt in 
recent campaign stops, acknowl-edging that with 9.6 percent unem-ployment, the sputtering economy makes this election season difficult 
for Democrats.
“It’s hard because we’ve been 
through an incredibly difficult time 
as a nation,” Obama said Sunday. “We’ve gone through a tougher time than any time in the lifetime 
of most of us.”
Sunday’s rally 
at Ohio State 
was one of five 
the president was scheduled to attend ahead of Election Day, all designed to remind the 
Democratic base of the enthusiasm Obama inspired during his presi-
dential campaign.
The five rallies are all in states 
Obama won during his presiden-
tial bid, and all in states with com-petitive midterm races: Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Ohio, California and Nevada. Though Democratic officials say the president is cast-ing a wide net and trying to reach 
the whole of the Democratic party, 
some rallies do target specific con-stituencies.Obama targets key 
groups in homestretch

PROOF THAT ISLAM IS ENTITLED TO PROTECTION.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Federal 
attorneys on Monday jumped into a 
court battle over the construction of a Tennessee mosque by offering le-gal proof that Islam is a recognized 
religion entitled to constitutional 
protection.
U.S. Attorney Jerry E. Martin of 
Nashville said his office would not sit by while mosque opponents raise questions in court about whether Is-lam is a recognized religion. Martin said in a statement that to suggest otherwise “is quite simply ridicu-
lous.”
Martin’s office filed a brief saying 
as much in a state lawsuit brought 
by mosque opponents against Rutherford County for granting permission for construction of the building.
Mosque opponents are challeng-
ing whether the county acted prop-erly in granting the construction per -
mit. Their complaint claims that the county failed to determine whether the Islamic Center of Murfreesboro 
is entitled to protection under the 
First Amendment. They have also claimed that the county violated the 
state’s Open Meet-ings law in the ap-proval process.
Martin said his 
office was not inter -
vening in the lawsuit itself to take 
sides, but attorneys felt the need to 
weigh in on issues raised during three days of testimony in Ruther -
ford County Chancery Court.
“Plaintiffs’ implication that Islam 
is not a recognized religion by the United States is wrong and is not supported by any authority whatso-ever,” he said.Officials file legal

UF SOCCER POLL QUESTION QUOTABLEMatt Tripp / Alligator Staff
UF center Vernon Macklin (back) and small forward Chandler Parsons (front) attended 
the 2010 Nike LeBron James Skills Academy in the summer.
By GREG LUCA
Alligator Staff Writer
gluca@alligator.org
 
Just days before LeBron James decided 
to take his talents to South Beach, Chandler 
Parsons and V ernon Macklin decided to take 
their talents to him. 
As part of a busy offseason, the two seniors 
traveled to Akron, Ohio, to participate in the 
2010 Nike LeBron James Skills Academy . 
There, Parsons and Macklin had an op-
portunity to improve their games by working with some of the NBA’s elite talents. 
“It was awesome,” Parsons said. “To go 
there and play against the best players in the country was a real honor.”
The three-day camp gave both college and 
high school players the chance to work along-side NBA stars like Kevin Durant, Chris Paul and, of course, James. 
For Parsons and Macklin, it was also an 
opportunity to scout future opponents like Georgia’s Trey Thompkins and Travis Les-lie, Tennessee’s Scotty Hopson, and Kansas 
State’s Curtis Kelly and Jacob Pullen. 
“I was guarding Scotty Hobson and ob-
viously we were talking a little bit,” Parsons 
said. “My roommate was actually Curtis Kelly from Kansas State, so we were talking 
about the game and everyone’s excited about 
that.”
Macklin said the aspect of his game he 
worked on most was turning and facing the 
basket, and he and the other big men at the 
camp did a lot of work with open pivots. 
Macklin also added that, while playing 
against James was exciting, his favorite part 
of the experience was being a member of Par -
sons’ undefeated four-on-four team.
“We just showed basically that Florida 
guys, we’re ready to play,” Macklin said. 
The biggest thing Parsons says he’ll take 
away from the event is the knowledge of the 
tenacity and physicality that is required to be successful against strong competition.
“Playing against (Duke’s) Kyle Singler, 
(North Carolina’s) Harrison Barnes and 
(FSU’s) Chris Singleton, these guys are tough 
and you can’t really take a play off,” Parsons said. “I think I did really well. I think I held my own and played just as good as any of 
those guys.”
Parsons’ acclimation to a more physical 
style of play looks to have come at the per -
fect time, as several Gators have remarked 
that this year’s practices have been extremely 
tough and competitive. 
Yeguete impressing: While freshmen 
Cody Larson and Patric Young were expect-
ed to bring increased physicality to the team, 
Florida has also gotten a lift from a third, 
more unexpected, player. 
That man is 6-foot-7, 210-pound freshman 
Will Yeguete, who drew praise from Young 
as “the most standout freshman” and from 
sophomore guard Kenny Boynton as his “biggest surprise.”
According to Parsons, Yeguete has been 
outperforming everyone on the court in hustle stats — deflections, taking charges and helping on defense. 
“The kid just has a knack for the ball,” 
Parsons said. “He’s long, he’s quick, he really gets 
his hands on the ball and 
steps up. He does all the little things.”
Boynton adds that Yeg-
uete has been providing more than just hustle plays, saying that the freshman 
from Bordeaux, France, 
has been finishing well around the rim and getting a number of offensive rebounds. 
Boynton speculates Yeguete held back a 
little in the team’s open gym activities, but he is opening up his game and playing with 
more confidence.
“He wasn’t doing what he’s doing now of-
fensively ,” Boynton said. “He surprised me a 
lot, I didn’t know he was that good.” 
Media picks Gators to win SEC: In a 
preseason media poll released Monday after -
noon, Florida was selected to win the South-
eastern Conference.
The Gators received half of the 16 votes, 
with the remaining eight spread across Mis-
sissippi State (three), Kentucky (two), Tennes-
see (two) and Georgia (one).  Parsons, Macklin reap benefits from LeBron’s camp
A Craigslist posting for a 
new UF offensive coordi-nator hit the internet Mon-
day because current offensive co-ordinator Steve Addazio “is the suckiest suck that ever sucked,” according to one Facebook status 
immediately following the Mis-
sissippi State debacle Saturday. 
This is funny and relatively ac-
curate in my opinion, and most likely the opinion of most Gators fans.
I wouldn’t dare argue on Add-
azio’s behalf. 
He is seemingly overmatched 
and utterly incapable of publicly taking responsibility for the de-ficiencies of both his offense and 
position group (the offensive 
line). 
Addazio routinely patronizes 
the media and the fans with his “nothing to see here” routine, and he deserves every bit of criticism 
that comes 
his way. 
But let’s 
get one thing 
s t r a i g h t 
here: this cross of of-fensive in-
eptitude is not Addazio’s alone to bare. 
While Addazio is under con-
stant fire from the public, it looks 
like Urban Meyer might walk 
away from this 2010 disaster un-scathed. 
Meyer has built up so much 
good will by winning two nation-al championships that most fans either don’t even think to criticize him or simply find it uncouth to do so. But Meyer is the one who 
handed the keys to the Mercedes to Addazio after Dan Mullen bolt-
ed for Starkville.
Meyer’s decision was so un-
foreseen that most people believe 
Billy Gonzales left town in a lat-
eral move for SEC-rival LSU be-cause he felt the OC job should have been his.
Gonzales had been in the 
Meyer deserves some blame for Florida’s offensive struggles

Two things have 
dropped Robin-son from the top of the Heisman world the last two weeks: losing and injuries. 
Michigan has dropped two in a row to Michigan State and Iowa, and Robinson was replaced by Tate Forcier on Saturday after leaving the game with injury. Still, he has rushed for at least 86 yards in every game and still has more passing yards than Newton. “Shoelace” is still the nation’s leading rusher by almost 170 yards. 
Blackmon torched Texas Tech 
for 10 catches, 207 yards and a touchdown over the weekend and has been the best offensive weapon for the undefeated Cowboys. He leads the nation in receiving yards and receiving 
touchdowns. He has posted double-digit catch-es four times, scored at least one touchdown in every game and gone over 125 receiving yards in every contest. The Michael’s Ducks had a bye this week 
but opened at No. 2 in the BCS standings largely due to the sophomore’s contribu-tions. James has compiled his stats in only ﬁ  ve games after missing the opening week against New Mexico. He has scored 
at least a touchdown in every game and rushed for more than 200 total yards three times. Moore leads the nation in pass-
er rating and has the Broncos plowing toward an undefeated regular season and a BCS Bowl bid. He was 14 for 16 for 231 yards and two touchdowns in 
the ﬁ  rst half of a 48-0 route of San Jose State. 
The junior has thrown at least two touchdowns 
in every game this season. If Newton slips up, this could be Moore’s race to lose. Killa Cam (Killa who?) earns the unani-
mous No. 1 contender spot in our Heisman Watch thanks to Auburn’s big 65-43 win against Arkansas over the weekend, in which Newton threw for 140 yards and a touchdown, and rushed for 188 yards and 
three more scores. The Tigers are still undefeated, and Newton ranks second in the country in passer rating and fourth in rushing yards: The perfect recipe for a Heisman Trophy.

Alexander Silva / Alligator StaffMeyer camp since playing for him at 
Colorado State in the early ‘90s, and he helped create Meyer’s offense along 
with Mullen. 
If handpicking Addazio over Gon-
zales isn’t enough to earn Meyer a slice 
of the criticism pie, I ask the fans: How 
do you think the relationship between 
Meyer and Addazio works?
I’m betting they meet up every 
Sunday. Meyer tells Addazio who they are playing and then gives him 
carte blanche on gameplanning for the 
week. 
Meyer then pays no attention to how 
the offense looks Tuesday-Thursday. 
Addazio calls his plays without input 
from Meyer on Saturday. Meyer stands on the sideline with a look of horror on his face as he watches plays he’s never seen culminate in a seven-point show-
ing against the Bulldogs. But Meyer 
never, ever gives his input. He trusts Addazio completely. 
Yeah. Right. 
Meyer built his reputation as an of-
fensive guru. There’s no way he hasn’t 
always been hands on with UF’s of-fense, and I can only imagine he is most hands on when the offensive co-
ordinator may have just “fall[en] off 
the pickle boat,” to borrow a saying from Addazio. 
The offense does not turn to gold 
just because Meyer touches it.
Urban Meyer is probably the best 
recruiter in the nation and a great mo-tivator, but he has never been a great 
in-game coach. Even when the Gators 
were on top of the college football world. 
Winning masks a lot of imperfec-
tions. But if we go back and examine one specific drive predating Addazio’s reign of terror,  Gators fans will see plenty of similarities to what upsets them today.
During the third quarter of the 2006 
SEC Championship Game against Ar -
kansas, Meyer was at the helm for per -
haps the worst coached drive I‘ve ever watched.  
Trailing by four in the second half, 
he called a fake punt from his own 15-yard line, misused his pocket passer, blew all three timeouts and punted on 4th and 1 from his own 41.
On Florida’s previous drive, Arkan-
sas took a 21-17 lead when Chris Leak, who piled up a whopping 137 rushing yards in his four-year career, pitched 
the ball to an Arkansas defensive line-
man for a pick-six on an option play.
On this drive (see right), Leak was 
asked to run an option play two more times and fumbled on one of the at-
tempts, though Jim Tartt recovered for 
Florida.
Meyer put the finishing touches on 
the masterpiece by burning his final 
timeout only to have Eric Wilbur punt 
it away anyway.  
Then Reggie Fish muffed the punt. 
Wondy Pierre-Louis recovered the ball for a touchdown. The Gators took a 
24-21 lead. UCLA upset USC. Florida 
beat Ohio State, winning its first na-tional championship under Meyer. Tim Tebow and Percy Harvin, two one-of-
a-kind athletes, went beast mode in 
2008, the second championship season under Meyer. 
And now Lee Harvey Oswald — err, 
Steve Addazio — acted alone in the as-
sassination of the 2010 Florida offense. 
But it doesn’t take a conspiracy the-
orist to see that there’s blood on Mey-
er’s hands as well.KYLE , from page 13
Florida vs. Arkansas 2006 SEC Championship
Down 21-17 after UF quarterback Chris Leak threw a pick-six on an 
option pitch, Urban Meyer obviously felt this was an incredibly impor -
tant drive in the game based on his decision making. But ultimately, the end result covered up a miserably coached drive.

CARLSBAD, Calif. — Former NFL star linebacker Ju-
nior Seau drove off a cliff and was hospitalized with mi-
nor injuries Monday, less than nine hours after he was ar -
rested on suspicion of domestic violence.
The 12-time Pro Bowler’s white Cadillac SUV was 
found on the beach about 100 feet below the roadside, said Carlsbad police Lt. Kelly Cain. 
Cain said it wasn’t a sheer cliff, but was a significant, 
rough slope. Seau was taken to Scripps La Jolla Hospital 
in San Diego.
Seau’s 25-year-old live-in girlfriend told authorities 
that Seau assaulted her during an argument Sunday night at his Oceanside home, according to Oceanside police. She appeared to have minor injuries and did not require medical treatment.
Seau, 41, was arrested outside his home about two 
hours after police arrived. He wasn’t home when authori-ties arrived but they asked him to return when he called his girlfriend.
Seau posted bail and was released from the San Diego 
County jail in Vista.
“At this point we think he’s fine but we really don’t 
have any comment,” said Richard Doan, who answered the cell phone of Bette Hoffman, who works for Seau’s foundation. “There are no injuries but he seems to be a 
little shaken up.”
Hospital spokeswoman Lisa Ohmstede declined to 
comment on Seau’s condition.
Seau was a star linebacker with the University of 
Southern California before going to the San Diego Char -
gers with the fifth pick overall in the 1990 draft. He led the 
Chargers to the Super Bowl following the 1994 season and remained in San Diego until being traded to the Miami

With the season less than a 
month away, coach Amanda Butler 
has been busy. 
The first full schedule of prac-
tices begins this week and Butler is wasting no time in readying her 
squad. 
Teaching has been at the forefront 
as six new players join the program this season. Butler stressed the im-
portance of having a foundation to 
build on and said she’s impressed by the progress so far.
“With competition right around 
the corner — but yet, it seems so far away — we’ve just got to focus on 
getting better every day,” she said.
Butler added that the returning 
players have done a good job of set-ting an example for the freshmen in 
practice, which has translated into 
growth as a team. The players are 
starting to learn her scheme and be-come acclimated to the system.
“There are some things that 
we have in now that are no longer ‘new,’” Butler said. “That’s exciting. Every day’s not completely brand 
new.”
Freshman Deaundra Young is 
one of the new players making 
strides in practice, despite her limi-
tations. Young has not fully recov-
ered from offseason surgery. Pain-ful growths under her arms forced the removal of sweat glands, and Young’s range of motion is still lim-
ited. 
“For a kid to not be able to lift 
her arms over her head but still get-
ting rebounds and scoring is really 
weird looking,” Butler joked. “But 
it kind of gives you an idea of how good Deaundra is.”
Young joins the Gators rated as 
the No. 8 power forward and the 
No. 48 player overall by ESPN’s 
HoopGurlz and will compete with returning sophomore and South-eastern Conference All-Freshman 
Team member Jennifer George for 
playing time — something the two 
are familiar with.
George’s Orlando Bishop Moore 
High took on Young’s Titusville As-tronaut High in the 2009 Class 4A 
State Championship, with Young’s team getting the win. But the two 
are now teammates instead of ri-
vals, working together for a com-
mon goal.
“It speaks to both of their pas-
sion, for wanting to be winners and 
the type of competitors that they 
are,” Butler said. 
On how the two are meshing, 
Butler said, “They’re great team-mates right now. And the history 
they had, the battles in high school, they’ve kind of set that aside and are more focused on winning cham-pionships together.” 
George had one of the best de-
buts in school history last year scor -
ing 21 points on 7-of-9 shooting in only 16 minutes of action in the sea-son opener. Her minutes increased 
at the end of the season due to an 
injury to center Azania Stewart. 
But Butler said she is still de-
termining who the best players 
are and who will be in the starting 
lineup when UF opens play Nov. 13 against UCF in Gainesville.
Although starting positions are 
up in the air and much is yet to be 
determined about this year’s team, 
one thing is certain: these Gators won’t lack passion. 
“We want to be thinking and 
talking and living as much as we 
can as champions, to the point that 
it really does become an obsession,” 
Butler said. “It’s really got to be a 
way we live here as student-ath-
letes — with an obsession of mak-
ing history and doing things that 
have never been done.”Young fighting for time at PF

OVERTIME SUNDAY.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
 
DAVIE — The Miami Dolphins wanted 
to show they were 60-minute men. They 
went 66 minutes instead.
Miami had plenty of staying power in 
an overtime victory at Green Bay, a big 
change after consecutive losses at home, 
when second-half lapses made for very un-
happy endings.
“It’s definitely something to build on,” 
safety Yeremiah Bell said. “We talked about it the night before the game: playing a com-
plete game and not beating ourselves. It was 
very satisfying, especially coming off two losses. It puts a good taste in your mouth. Hopefully we can keep that taste for a long 
time, and guys can get used to it.”
The Dolphins twice came from behind, 
and for the first time this season, they out-
scored an opponent after halftime. Dan Carpenter’s 44-yard field goal six minutes 
into overtime gave Miami a 23-20 victory.
The Dolphins (3-2) will likely need four 
solid quarters again Sunday to beat AFC 
North leader Pittsburgh (4-1). Pro Bowl 
tackle Jake Long expects the win at Green 
Bay to provide momentum.
“This is a big step for us to show that 
we can come back and don’t panic,” Long said.
In back-to-back defeats against the Jets 
and Patriots, the Dolphins shriveled under the glare of prime time. The latter loss was especially disheartening because Miami was outscored 35-7 in the second half.
Coach Tony Sparano reminded his team 
of that collapse at halftime Sunday in Green Bay, when the score was 10-10.
“We got in the locker and talked long 
and hard about how two weeks ago we had 
the opportunity to control what happened 
in the second half of the game, and from the outset we didn’t do it,” Sparano said. “We wanted to change that.”
And they did. The Dolphins mounted a 59-yard scoring 
drive to start the second half, then scored again on Chad Henne’s 22-yard pass to An-thony Fasano — their first fourth-quarter touchdown this season.
In overtime, they forced a three-and-out 
by Green Bay to set up Carpenter’s kick. Special teams closed out the victory and were sound throughout after a meltdown in the loss to New England.
The big plays were a big change for a 
team that had been outscored 69-32 after halftime this season. Success in such situa-tions breeds more of it, Fasano said.
“It’s good having those experiences un-
der your belt and being able to draw on them in times of need, especially for the young guys on the team,” he said.
Miami won with balance — 39 passes, 
39 runs, 73 yards rushing for Ronnie Brown and 64 for Ricky Williams. The Dolphins’ 150 yards rushing were a season high, as 
were their 26 first downs. They had a 10-minute edge in time of 
possession.
“When we needed to run it, 
we did well,” Long said. “That’s 
what we pride ourselves in, we 
want to be a good rushing team.”
The defense had a season-high five 
sacks, three by Cameron Wake, and al-lowed only 76 rushing yards. Chatty inside linebacker Channing Crowder started after 
missing the first four games with a groin 
injury, and tried to contribute even before the game began.
“On the plane, in the locker room, at the 
hotel, just to break up the quiet,” Crowder said. “People are always looking at the ground scared and walking around wor -
ried before the game. It’s still a football game. I bring a coolness to the team: ‘Let’s 
go out and have fun and enjoy what we 
do and play like we’re playing in the back yard.’”The Dolphins kept their cool with the 
game on the line, and the second-half breakthrough helped them keep pace in the AFC East with the Jets (5-1) and Patri-ots (4-1).
Miami’s schedule eases considerably af-
ter mid-November.“The two losses we had, we just messed 
up and hurt ourselves,” Crowder said. “I’ve been in this league long enough to know you don’t hit your stride until around this time of the year. Hopefully we have an 
identity now, and we can get on a roll and 
make a playoff run.”16, ALLIGATOR  TUESDAY, OCTOBER 19, 2010
