Mayor Craig Lowe discussed job creation, 
public safety and Gainesville’s future at the 
annual State of the City address Wednesday 
afternoon.
Lowe spoke to about 100 people inside 
the Hipp cinema, 25 SE Second Place, sum-
marizing the city’s improvement in the last 
year.
Lowe said 2012 was characterized by 
breakthrough business partnerships, which 
brought  jobs and innovation to the city.
“Our collaboration with the private sector 
was a major highlight of the past year,” he said. “I ﬁ  rmly believe that we have left be-hind any ideas of a business-unfriendly en-vironment that have been suggested in the 
past.”
The most notable partnership, he said, 
was information technology company Mind-
tree’s decision to plant its ﬁ  rst major U.S. de-velopment center in Gainesville, which cre-
ated about 400 jobs.
He also mentioned Silver Airways’ deci-
sion to relocate from Ft. Lauderdale to the 
Gainesville Regional Airport. 
The move brought about 100 new jobs to the city’s east side, many offering yearly 
salaries of about $50,000. 
The relocation also expanded ﬂ  ight ser-
vice from the Gainesville airport to three 
more locations. 
He mentioned the negotiations with Mo-
biquity, a mobile app developer that will po-tentially bring about 250 jobs with it to the area.
Lowe also praised the city’s partnership 
with Regional Transit System that improved 
bus service, slashing wait times on routes in the city’s east side. 
He said further innovations for the east 
side included the city’s partnership with the Alachua County Library District to add the ﬁ  rst library branch at Fred Cone Park.
He attributed the city’s success to the col-
laboration between citizens, businesses and local government.
“It’s only by coming together that we will 
be able to build … a sound economy,” he said.
In light of the Newtown, Conn., shoot-
ings, Lowe said he looks forward to protect-ing Gainesville residents in 2013.
He said he recently met with the mayors 
of Blacksburg, Va., and Albuquerque, N.M., two cities that were struck with tragic shoot-ings in recent years, to discuss public safety.
“What these discussions brought home to 
me is but for the grace of God, that would be Gainesville – our city,” Lowe said.
After the meeting, Lowe said, he rec-

Britany Grifﬁ  n has been taking 
birth control since August 2012. When 
she went to get it from Walgreens this 
month, her insurance company, Blue 
Cross and Blue Shield, no longer re-quired her to pay the $7 co-payment.
“I had no idea until I went to pick 
it up. I was shocked,” the 18-year-old psychology freshman said. Because Grifﬁ  n did not have a co-pay for her Mononessa, she felt like she was get-ting it for free, she said.
Although birth control and other 
contraceptives are not completely free, some private insurance com-panies cover the co-pay under their 
monthly premium.
New insurance plans were re-
quired to meet these guidelines by 
August 1, 2012.   However, for most women,  it will 
go into effect this month because the new plan’s coverage year begins in January, according to an article on 
www.raisingwomensvoices.net.
Katie Vogel Anderson, a clinical 
assistant professor at UF’s College of 
Pharmacy and Col-
lege of Medicine, 
suggested that wom-
en call the number 
on the back of their insurance cards to 
see if their plans 
cover co-pays.
“The insurance 
plan is dependent on when the perk actually kicks in,” Vogel Anderson 
said. “Although it can be frustrating 
to call, it really would be worth it.”

empt at ﬁ  rst, but the government Some birth control covered

UF building construction junior Alfredo 
Espinosa announced his candidacy today for 
the District 4 City Commissioner seat.
Espinosa, 20, will run against W.E. “Mac” 
McEachern and Gainesville Commissioner Randy Wells.
District 4 consists of most of UF’s campus 
and areas north of West University Avenue.
Espinosa said UF encompasses a large part 
of the district.
“I’m running to give the University of 
Florida a voice at the table,” he said.
His platform includes tackling crime, look-
ing into high utility rates, cutting down traf-ﬁ  c, helping the homeless and making the area a business-friendly environment.
“My goal is to make it very easy to thrive 
in this environment,” Espinosa said.He said that as a student, he is living in “the 
core of our district,” adding that he would ap-
ply that perspective to the commission.
Wells, the incumbent, won the commission 
seat in 2010 when he beat Penny Wheat — a 
former Alachua County commissioner — in a 
runoff election.
According to Alligator archives, Wells 
said he would work to improve the relation-
ship between the city and small businesses in his 2013 campaign.
McEachern, who is a former city com-
missioner, said he wants to bridge the gap between residents and the city, according to Alligator archives.

Gainesville Police is looking for 
three men suspected of attacking 
and robbing a UF student Tuesday 
night.
Shortly after 10 p.m., Gainesville 
Police responded to a robbery on 
Northwest 16th Street after a 21-year-
old student reported to police that he 
had been robbed, said GPD spokes-man Officer Ben Tobias.
The student told police three men 
approached him as he walked down 
Northwest 16th Street, Tobias said. 
One of the men punched the student in the face and took his phone.
The men continued to attack the 
student and later fled west on North-west First Avenue, Tobias said.
GPD and UPD officers and a po-
lice dog searched the area but could not find the men, Tobias said.
At 10:40 p.m., University Police 
sent a UF Alert to students, faculty and staff, describing the three sus-
pects as 20-year-old black men. One 
wore a red shirt with black shorts. The other men wore white shirts and basketball shorts.
At 11:42 p.m., police sent another 
alert, which said they cleared the scene.
If you have any information about 
this case, contact GPD detectives at 
352-393-7670 or text “GPDFL” plus 
your tip to 274637.

More than 30 UF students gathered on 
Turlington Plaza to host a candlelight vigil for 
the dead and injured students of Aleppo Uni-versity Wednesday night.
Sameer Saboungi, an 18-year-old UF in-
ternational studies freshman, organized the event. The vigil, which was part of a move-ment at universities around the world, hon-ored the more than 80 people who died at the university, Saboungi said.
On Jan. 15, two explosions blasted an archi-
tecture building and a dormitory holding ref-ugees while university students were taking 
their final exams, he said. Aleppo University 
is one of the largest universities in Syria, with about 61,000 students, according to Classbase, an online education information database.
“It could have been me,” Saboungi said. 
“It could have been you.”
Saboungi said he found the names of 23 
victims through activist groups.
Basil Jandali, a 21-year-old third-year UF 
mechanical engineering student, read the names aloud as members of the crowd lit can-dles one-by-one to represent the fallen.
Suhaib Harraka, a former student at Alep-po University, spoke at the vigil about his ex-periences in Syria. Harraka said Syrian secret 
police brutally beat and tortured his friends 
in response to their peaceful demonstrations about student arrests. After the secret police came to his home looking for him, Harraka had no choice but to flee.
“Everything was taken away from them,” 
said Riham Hamed, a 22-year-old UF statistics senior, “their homes, their food, their water.”

◗ THEY ARE HERE TO JUDGE 
A COMPETITION.
JENSEN WERLEY
Alligator Contributing Writer
All seven Florida Supreme 
Court justices will be at UF to-
day to judge the Maguire Appel-
late Advocacy Competition.
The event, which is an exhi-
bition for the American Bar As-
sociation competition, will be at 
10 a.m. today in the Martin H. 
Levin Advocacy Center court-room. It is free and open to the public.
The exhibition allows the two 
UF Moot Court teams that will argue in the regional competi-
tion to practice their arguments 
and get feedback from the Flor -
ida justices, said Bob O’Linn, a 25-year-old, third-year law stu-
dent and publicity chairman for 
Florida Moot Court.
A moot court is a mock trial 
for an appeals case that has no witnesses or jurors. Instead, the 
team must argue the merits of 
the law, O’Linn said.
During their arguments, they must field questions from the justices. At the end, the justices will give their opinions on the 
case.
The teams 
will compete in the regional 
competition — 
with the same 
case from to-day — Feb. 14 in Las Vegas.
The case 
involves whether a police offi-cer can be held liable in a law-suit. Team members will argue whether the actions of an officer in a fictitious case were within the limits of his or her job.
“It’s a great opportunity to 
showcase skills in front of the UF community and legal com-munity and to hone arguments,” O’Linn said.
Mary Adkins, the team’s 
faculty adviser, said it was an accomplishment that all seven justices were coming to the ex-hibition.
“They are usually busy listen-
ing to real cases in Tallahassee,” she said.Florida Supreme Court justices to visit UF today“Everything was taken away from

The winning word was “ridicu-
lous,” much like the other words 
featured in the Alachua County 
Public Schools District Spelling 
Bee.
Nervous students and more-
stressed family members filled the 
Kirby-Smith Administration Cen-
ter Wednesday afternoon for the spelling bee. 
The contest featured 39 par -
ticipants ranging from fifth- to eighth-graders from 35 elementa-
ry and middle schools in Alachua 
County.
Onlookers learned definitions and language origins of words varying from “desperado” to “keelhaul,” words seemingly fit 
for an SAT vocabulary book. But it 
was contestant 31, seventh-grad-er Emma Porter from Oak View Middle School, who will represent 
Alachua County at the state spell-
ing competition.
Porter, who is “12 and a half,” 
said she studied for 15 hours for Wednesday’s competition since 
she won for Oak View Middle 
School in early December. 
Her youth leader, Sarah Hig-
gins, 24, helped her study, al-
though Higgins claimed that it 
was mainly Porter quizzing her on vocabulary.After 22 rounds and 37 con-
testants eliminated, Aleandra Ro of Oak Hall School lost to Porter 
when she misspelled “regatta.”
After winning, Porter celebrat-
ed with her family and mentor 
and exclaimed:
“I can’t wait to tell my softball 
team!”
Porter will go on to the 69th 
Florida Times-Union Regional Spelling Bee in Jacksonville Feb. 
16. 
The winner also received priz-
es from local vendors, including 
a five-day trip to Camp Crystal 
Lake.
The spelling words came from 
the Scripps National Spelling Bee 
word list, said event coordinator Isabel Carter.
This was Carter’s second year 
organizing the competition.
“This year was different,” she 
said. “We are glad that a student 
within the public school district 
won this year. It has usually been homeschoolers.”
The final four contestants were 
equally split between private and 
public school students.
Jenny Bunn, Carter’s secre-
tary, said this year brought an in-
creased response in sponsors from 
last year, which was the first year 
the event was sponsored. 
Businesses, such as Barnes & 
Noble, Conestogas Restaurant and Camp Crystal Lake, donated 
prizes to the contestants.
“Every kid is entitled to a re-
ward,” Bunn said.4, ALLIGATOR §  THURSDAY, JANUARY 24, 2013

FOR THE 8 P.M. HIGH DIVE SHOW.
DEVON ABELMAN
Alligator Contributing Writer
A UF student will take the stage before 
an American Idol winner tonight.
Rachel Pearlstein will open for Kris Al-
len at High Dive at 8 p.m. A set by Jillette 
Johnson will follow before the season-eight star plays. Tickets are $14 at the door.
Tonight will be the second time Pearl-
stein, who goes by Rachel Rose on stage, performs in Gainesville at a paid gig. The 20-year-old sociology junior played at the Swamp Restaurant in Fall.
Her Swamp debut was impromptu. While 32-year-old singer Jamie Davis took a break during his set one night, Pearlstein 
asked Davis if she could fill in, saying, “I 
promise I don’t suck.”
Davis let her play, and he later referred 
her to a Glory Days Presents promoter, Pat Lavery, when he started looking for an 
acoustic opener. Lavery took the sugges-
tion and contacted Pearlstein.
Pearlstein said she never watched 
“American Idol,” but she knew who Allen 
was when she received the news that she 
would open for him. 
Pearlstein was so excited that she had 
to pull over while driving so she wouldn’t crash, said Jordan Weber, a 19-year-old 
psychology freshman.
“It’s exciting to think that people like 
my music and really enjoy my voice,” Pearlstein said. “It’s great singing into a 
microphone or hearing the sound of my 
guitar amplified.”
Pearlstein will perform with her guitar, 
which she started playing 
at 13.
“I always loved how 
the guitar sounded in songs,” she said, “and I wanted to be able to do it 
with my singing.”   
She said she started 
playing Taylor Swift 
songs, but her style evolved during the past year. Her favorite covers to play are Fleetwood Mac’s “Landslide” and Tracy 
Chapman’s “Fast Car.”
“I usually don’t play my originals for 
people,” she said. “I usually play a lot of covers because I like kind of making a new 
version out of a well-known song.”
The singer/songwriter transferred to 
UF after attending Yeshiva University in New York. 
Pearlstein said she wanted to be in a 
warmer state, which helps inspire the 
nature-centered songs she likes to write 
outside.
“Most of my songs aren’t about guys 
or heartbreak,” she said, “especially my 
older songs.”
Sarah Levin, a 19-year-old UF animal 
science freshman, said Pearlstein sings “to 
be peaceful.”
“It gets her out of the daily problems,” 
Levin said. “I feel like that is what a lot of singers strive for — to get out of their head — and she already has that.”UF student to open for ‘American Idol’ winner Kris Allen

‘Ridiculous’ wins, ‘keelhaul’ is a word
predicts that all insurance companies will be required to 
cover contraceptives within a few years, according to the website. 
These contraceptives include the oral pill, Nuvaring, 
contraceptive implants, Depo shots, diaphragms, cervical caps and permanent contraceptives such as tubal ligation.
Over-the-counter options like condoms or the morning-
after pill may be covered if a doctor prescribes them first, but abortions are not. 
All brands aren’t covered, but all contraceptives ap-
proved by the Food and Drug Administration are cov-ered.
Because specific birth control brands aren’t covered, 
Vogel Anderson said women can choose to switch brands. 
If a woman doesn’t mind switching, she may be able 
to take advantage of no co-pay, but switching brands isn’t 
as easy as picking up a different pack of pills next month, 
she said.
“Once you’re used to a particular brand or formulation, 
it can take awhile for your body to get used to [a new pre-scription],” Vogel Anderson said. “Sometimes, the switch 
isn’t always as easy as you might anticipate it to be.”
The new act worked in Griffin’s favor. Walgreens de-
clined to comment on whether the number of birth control 
prescriptions the pharmacy filled fluctuated this month.
For women who might switch brands just to take ad-
vantage of these new perks, Vogel Anderson had one question: “If a co-pay is as low as $6 or $7, do you really care about not having a co-pay?”
Other preventative services covered under the act in-
clude an annual preventative care visit, a diabetes screen-
ing during pregnancy, annual HIV screening and counsel-
ing. Other preventative 
services are offered under the act, too
Lowe said biomass plant is a step toward reducing carbon footprint
ommended the Gainesville City 
Commission “establish a concrete position on sensible regulation to promote public safety.”
Lowe also deemed the opening 
of a biomass plant north of the city this summer as a step toward “re-ducing our community’s carbon footprint.” 
He said it will “move us away 
from our dependence on dirty, out-of-state coal.”
Evelyn Foxx, president of the 
Alachua County NAACP ,  attend-ed the speech.
 Foxx said she is pleased with 
the city’s success attracting new job-creators to the area.
She said bringing jobs that don’t 
require college degrees is a positive addition to a city that already val-ues higher education.
“UF is a flagship. We are very 
proud to have it in our communi-ty,” she said. “It does not, by any means, devalue education. That is still one of the most important things.”
With city elections looming, 
Greg Johnson, a Gainesville Area Chamber of Commerce board member, said he felt Lowe’s ad-dress focused objectively on the city’s progress.
“I’ve been a witness to what has 
been going on, and this excitement about these things he’s been talking about go beyond the politics and the election,” Johnson said. “We’re all excited about the business com-munity.”

Instead, she asked them to do-
nate to the Alachua County Hu-mane Society.
The Deffense family has a strong 
love for animals — a love that com-pelled Wolf-Deffense, 45, to forgo flower donations at UPD Officer Jean-Guy Deffense’s funeral Jan. 9.
Since the funeral, the facility has 
received about $500 in his name, 
and that doesn’t include online 
donations, said Amanda Burks, ex-ecutive director.
Burks said taking care of an 
animal for 30 days costs the facility about $350.
Wolf-Deffense said she wants 
the donations to go to the Alachua County Humane Society because it 
is a no-kill facility.
“We feel so greatly about no 
dogs being euthanized,” she said. 
“That meant a lot to us.”
The facility relies heavily on do-
nations, Burks added. Its income consists of proceeds from its thrift store, donations and a minimal profit from adoptions.
Burks said she felt honored that 
the Deffense family decided to send donations to the shelter.
“We’re really grateful that, in 
their time of hurting and need, that they would think of someone else, or animals, that need help as well,” she said.
Wolf-Deffense said that her 
love of animals came from her hus-band.
She has two dogs, a greyhound-
husky mix named Sugar, and a yellow Labrador retriever named 
Spice. She said they have helped her heal since her husband died.
“I just feel like Jean is a part of 
them because we had such close-
ness with them,” she said. “So, I hold them tight, and it’s kind of neat.”
The Deffenses’ love of animals 
is well-known, especially among UPD officers.
Sgt. Darin Gentry, a family 
friend who worked with Deffense at University Police, chuckled as he described plucking dog hair from Deffense’s uniform in the past.
“Their dogs are their kids,” he 
said. “Their dogs are their life.”
Wolf-Deffense adopted Sugar 
from the Humane Society. She lat-er acquired Spice from a resident at her old job.
Sugar is a certified service dog, 
Wolf-Deffense said. She takes Sug-ar to Shands at UF to visit patients in the cancer and pediatric wards.
Wolf-Deffense said one of the 
most rewarding moments with Sugar happened when they visited a 10-year-old girl with autisism. The girl had difficulty understand-ing emotions, and Sugar was there 
to help.
The girl hugged Sugar during 
that visit and later hugged her 
mom.
Wolf-Deffense said that was the 
first time the girl showed affection toward her mother.
“Sugar taught her that feeling 
of hugging and that it’s OK to be 
close,” she said.
Wolf-Deffense described the 
dogs’ personalities the way a par -
ent would describe a child: Sugar is 
intensely loving and independent, while Spice is the protector of the family.
While Spice is tougher, Wolf-
Deffense said, he is still sweet. She 
said his favorite toy, an un-stuffed 
raccoon known as his gag-me toy, is one of his prized possessions. She said he enjoys swallowing and regurgitating it repeatedly.
The dogs’ love provides Wolf-
Deffense with inner strength, she said. 
Sugar and Spice have given her a 
reason to leave the house and have comforted her during her grief.
“It’s undying, unconditional 
love that I can’t explain,” she said. “I wish humans could be as uncon-ditional as the dogs. This world 
would be a much better place.”THURSDAY, JANUARY 24, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 5

WOMEN IN COMBAT!
Did we scare you? Did the idea of a woman near a 
battleﬁ  eld send a shiver of fear down your spine? 
Cool. Get used to the idea.
This week, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta will lift a ban that 
prevents women from serving in combat. 
According to a report from the Associated Press, the reversal 
of the ban opened “hundreds of thousands of front-line posi-tions and potentially elite commando jobs after generations of limits on their service.”
“I can conﬁ  rm media reports that the secretary and the chair-
man are expected to announce the lifting of the direct combat exclusion rule for women in the military,” said a senior De-fense Department ofﬁ  cial, according to ABC News. “This policy 
change will initiate a process whereby the services will develop 
plans to implement this decision, which was made by the secre-tary of defense upon the recommendation of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.”
That sounds like a bunch of mumbo jumbo jargon, right?Basically, Panetta signed away a ban that will be fully lifted 
by 2016. Some of those new jobs and positions could open up this year, others may take more time.
Either way, what a great step forward for women. There’s 
no reason anyone in military and combat situations should be shamed or looked down on because they are the “fairer sex.” 
We’re about to ﬁ  nally pass the point where we have to keep 
proving ourselves able.
“Panetta also directed the services to examine ways to open 
more combat roles to women,” ABC News wrote. “However, the ban on direct combat positions has remained in place.”
An ofﬁ  cial announcement from Panetta’s ofﬁ  ce is expected 
some time this week, and hopefully it will give us more details. 
Because that quote from the article seems to hint that women 
still aren’t “allowed” in direct combat positions.
We want total equality. It shouldn’t matter what sex or orien-
tation a person is. “Women comprise about 14 percent of the 1.4 million active military personnel,” the Associated Press wrote. We matter.
About a year ago, the Pentagon “unveiled a new policy that 
opened up 14,000 more posts for women in the military,” ac-cording to an article on Slate. That decision was made before 
two female Army reservists ﬁ  led a lawsuit “seeking to overturn 
the U.S. military’s restrictions on women in combat, claiming it violated their constitutional rights.”
They claimed the no-combat rule was based solely on sex and 
“violated their right to equal protection under the Fifth Amend-ment and ‘restricts their current and future earnings, their po-tential for promotion and advancement, and their future retire-ment beneﬁ  ts.’”
There’s no good argument to keep women off battleﬁ  elds or 
out of leadership positions in the military.  None.
It certainly seems like President Obama’s administration is 
working toward equality on all fronts. Remember when he end-ed the “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy?Know and obey the Career Showcase rules
Google “how to ﬁ  nd an internship,” and you’ll ﬁ  nd a plethora of websites that offer a step-by-step, fool-proof formula to secure your dream internship.
They all say the same thing: Exaggerate your resume, 
change your Facebook name, dress in black, arrive early, 
shake hands ﬁ  rmly , fake a smile, talk conﬁ  dently , ask three 
questions and send thank-you notes. If done properly and in that order, you get the job.
If everything we read on the Internet were true, we would 
all be interns at Google.
We’ve seen it happen. The super-conﬁ  dent guy who cuts 
you in line at Career Showcase and tells the recruiter how he single-handedly found a strategy that the University Athletic Association implemented to increase attendance and rev-
enue for the women’s basketball team.
Dude, you were in my group.
The internship search process is stressful and time-con-
suming.
Before an interview, you spend hours perfecting your re-
sume, crafting the perfect cover letter and practicing answers to possible interview questions. You go into the interview room, do your best and conﬁ  dently walk out with a good feeling. A week later, you get an email that says, “Thank you 
for your interest in [insert company]. Due to the high volume 
of applicants this year, we regret to inform you. . .”
By this point, I’ve learned that if an email doesn’t start 
with “Congratulations,” don’t read it.
With Career Showcase fewer than two weeks away, up-
per-class students are starting to prepare for the big day.
Freshmen need not attend. Unless they are interested in a 
bag of chips from Frito Lay or a silver pen from Capital One — some of the free marketing items available from recruiting 
companies.   
I went to Career Showcase my freshman and sophomore 
years. After I talked to a few recruiters, it was obvious I was 
not old enough to be considered for any of the positions of-fered.
When I ﬁ  rst approached a recruiter, I gave her my re-
sume, which still included high school leadership positions and awards.She calmly said, “Sorry , honey .  
Come back in a few years when you’re a junior.”
Now I am a junior, which quali-
ﬁ  es me to apply to more than 100 
internships that will be handed out 
to the best students.
But ﬁ  nding an internship or a 
job at Career Showcase isn’t that easy. The highly anticipated two-
day event is very much geared toward business and engi-neering students.
With hundreds of companies and more than 5,000 stu-
dents and alumni ﬁ  lling the ﬁ  rst and second ﬂ  oors of the 
Stephen C. O’Connell Center, the place is very busy and clut-
tered.
Every student is wearing the standard attire: a crisp suit. 
I’ve had friends who spent more than $200 on ﬁ  tted suits, and others who borrowed their friends’ oddly sized ones to share the same day. I’ve also had friends who have not at-tended because they didn’t have a suit at all.
Anyone who has gone wearing jeans, or even khaki pants 
and a dress shirt, knows that recruiters will dismiss your ca-
pabilities and will not even look you in the eye.
There is no such thing as casual Friday or even business 
casual.
Once you are in professional attire, you have to decide 
which recruiters to talk to and how to start a conversation. 
For me, this is always the hardest part.  
The typical conversation or “elevator pitch” starts by men-
tioning your name, class year, major and skills. You must sell yourself to a stranger.
You must convince him or her that you are better than the 
previous 100 students who very likely used the same line.
If you can garner their interest up to that point, congratu-
lations, you got the interview! 
Now you have another — even larger — set of rules to 
follow. Good luck!

Streeter Seidell, editor-in-chief of com-
edy website CollegeHumor.com, was an av-
erage student. He graduated from Fordham University without any academic scholar -
ships. 
 “I wasn’t good enough to get money, 
and I wasn’t bad enough to get money,” he said.
In support of other average Joes, Col-
legeHumor.com will host the first “Average Student Scholarship Contest” to award two mediocre students $5,000 toward their tu-ition. The application deadline is Feb. 1.
“Getting straight A’s was not what I 
needed in my life to confirm that I was a functioning member of society,” said Seidell. “A lot of it was born out of that. I remember when I was getting into colleges and apply-ing for scholarships, I didn’t get any because I wasn’t that good or that bad.”
Seidell said CollegeHumor is managing 
the contest without an outside sponsor.     
The application process requires a stu-
dent’s basic personal information and a written argument that supports his or her average qualifications. The essay must be no longer than 1,000 words 
and may be accompanied 
by photographs or vid-
eos.
“I think it’s a good 
idea to have something 
like this,” said Kelsey Jenkins, a 19-year-old UF public relations sopho-more. “Overachievers are always going to ap-
ply for scholarships, but you want to have 
some like this to motivate average students. 
It could help to bring people from a good level to a great level.” 
According to a news release, the Colleg-eHumor editorial staff will select the two winners based on “a combination of aca-demic averageness, humor and originality.”
“This isn’t CollegeHumor’s grand cri-
tique on society,” Seidell said. “Mostly, we just thought it was funny because no one else was doing it. At the same time, it feels nice to make some random kid’s life that much easier.”
Participants must be 18 or older and en-
rolled at a four-year college or university.
Winners will be announced and featured 
on the CollegeHumor website in early Feb-ruary. For more information, and to enter, go to www.collegehumor.com/average-stu-dent-scholarship-contest.

UF-based electronic duo Bells 
and Robes wrote its first EP with an 
extraterrestrial odyssey in mind.
“Every song we tried to create a 
world,” the pair’s melody producer, 
Luke Sipka, said Sunday, drumming 
his hands across a keyboard in his apartment behind Midtown. “If you really listen, there’s a lot of ambience in the background. We’ve had a lot of people tell us it’s head music.”
The apartment — filled with 
synth pads, speakers and boxes of the friends’ shared 500 vinyl-re-
cord collection — is where Sipka, a 
22-year-old UF telecommunication senior, and percussionist Dean Span-iol, a 21-year-old UF sports manage-ment junior, spent the last six months producing “Failing and Dreaming,” a 20-minute sonic expedition into psychedelic electronic music, which releases on SoundCloud Friday.
The UF fraternity-brothers-
turned-experimental-electronic-duo agreed to produce the EP June 20, the first day of the 2012 summer sol-stice.
But by Dec. 21, the start of win-
ter solstice, Sipka and Spaniol aban-doned the first two tracks.
“Failing was a big part of our 
concept,” Spaniol admitted. “We had trouble finishing songs.”
At first the two aimed to emulate 
popular electronic music, he said. Replicating poppy but simple beats seemed like a reasonable task.
Spaniol was involved in per -
cussion for almost 10 years. Sipka trained in jazz piano for 10 years. In high school, he worked for a year as a pianist at Santioni’s Cucina Itali-ana restaurant on Fleming Island.
But the two got stuck trying to 
perfect sections of tracks for weeks at a time, Spaniol said, only to lose sight of their original idea.“It was very disjointed,” Sipka 
said. “But it did have this vibe about 
it that you were in space floating.”
Tired of scrutinizing their songs 
into oblivion and with the midday 
sun sinking lower on the horizon ev-ery day , the duo started laying down tracks for “Failing and Dreaming” with one principle: “first instinct, best instinct.”
“It’s getting into that state of 
flow,” Sipka said. “You’re on the edge of not knowing whether it’s good or bad, but it’s just there.”
Writing in the morning and 
searching for samples online at night, Sipka and Spaniol sometimes mixed for 15 hours a week.
“We just didn’t want to hesitate,” 
Sipka said. “We just wanted to get 
our ideas out there”
In addition to releasing its 
EP this winter, he said, Bells and 
Robes teamed up with Tokyami Fish&Kicks clothing brand. Sipka and Spaniol produce the company website’s music and will star in a music video for the brand that will be released this year.
With “Failing and Dreaming” 
behind them, the duo decided Janu-ary is “Hip-Hop month.” Bells and Robes has four tracks of old school beats, Sipka said. He’s not worried that the new sound is a far cry from the psychedelic roots of their last project.
“This was the kind of stuff we 
were inspired by as we were mak-ing it,” he explained. “I guarantee the next EP we put out won’t sound like this EP .”
  
“Failing and Dreaming” is an 
eclectic collection of rumbling bass lines and upbeat synth paired with warm acoustic ele-ments. Robust melodies of horns, violins and reggae-style organs — dubbed “the world’s sounds” by Bells and Robes — give the 20-minute set a playful side that contrasts with the dark electric at-titude of its lower-pitched tones.
The vibe of the five-track con-
cept EP is unpredictable and, at times, downright bizarre, but in all the right ways. Full of ambient vinyl-record samples, echoing percussion and changing time-signatures, “Failing and Dream-ing” shows influence from L.A. beat scene bands like Flying Lo-tus and Beats Antique, but hints of inspiration from bands like Gorillaz and Radiohead are also apparent.
The friends’ producing tal-
ent is obvious from the moment listeners press play, but Spaniol 
really shines in the percussion 
powerhouse track “Astral Rain,” a number that sports a complex dancefloor rhythm under a lofty synth line.
Fans of pop-electronic music 
will find more comfort in “They Call Him Lixian.” Sipka produced the track using a lost music scale he found in an ‘80s composition book, but the track sounds like it could be the newest Bassnectar release.
Those seeking a few mechani-
cal tracks of four-to-the-floor beats and brutal dubstep drops 
favored by artists like Knife Par -
ty or Excision won’t find what 
they’re looking for in this release. But if you’re in the market for a thought-provoking journey in electronic music, “Failing and Dreaming” is a 20-minute trip into the proverbial rabbit hole worth taking.

“Scattered,” a dance production that 
features high-energy choreography and 
incorporates fluid music and film, kicked 
off its United States water-themed tour at UF Saturday . 
The Phillips Center for the Perform-
ing Arts buzzed as the dancers of Mo-tionhouse, the United Kingdom-based 
dance company, took center stage to be-
gin the premiere.
For Artistic Director Kevin Finnan, 
who is also co-founder of the company , water plays a crucial role in life as well as in his dance production.
The performers interact and dance 
with a curved projection screen wall that is about 14 feet tall, similar to a 
skateboard half-pipe. A video played on 
the wall as dancers slid, climbed, and crawled all over it to the beat of water-
themed music.
“The entire music soundtrack, film 
and dance are all knitted together. So at the beginning of the show, we press 
play , and the dancers have to know where they are the entire 70 minutes of 
the show — to the second — in order 
to interact with the film. They have to know the show inside and out,” Finnan said.
There were times during the show 
when the dancers hung from the top of 
the set, frozen in time like ice. Then they 
began to melt, turning into water drip-ping down the curved screen.
In another scene, a dancer battled an 
upward current of rushing water. She struggled to climb against a vicious tide, 
battling not only the stream of water but 
gravity, too.
“What I saw was a very artistic way 
of describing how life works — how people are stuck in emotion,” said Ralph Lamonge, an 18-year-old UF health sci-
ence freshman. “The way they incorpo-
rated water into their presentation and movements was pretty amazing.”
Ashley Forrester, a 20-year-old UF 
dance sophomore, was mesmerized.
“Just the physicality of it and how 
they just empower you to move. It was unreal,” she said.
Forrester said the dancers joined UF’s 
modern dance and composition dance classes earlier in the week to have some one-on-one time.
More than 1,350 tickets were sold for 
the performance, and the Motionhouse dancers were more than excited to start 
their first U.S. tour at UF.
“It’s a complete thrill,” Finnan said 
before he and his dance team did the ga-tor chomp and walked off the stage to 
continue the U.S. tour, which will travel to 17 more locations. “Go Gators.”  UK dance company

Sex. Money. Drugs.
These recurring themes in rap music 
return in A$AP Rocky’s debut studio 
album, “Long.Live.A$AP ,” a follow-
up to his 2011 mixtape, “Live.Love.A$AP.” 
The album was released last week, 
although many fans got a hold of it when it leaked about a month ago. 
“Long.Live.A$AP”topped the Bill-
board 200 albums chart, selling 139,000 copies, according to Nielsen Sound-
Scan and Billboard.com.
The name of the album is about as 
clever as the lyrics in it. It’s the same 
rehashed rap music you hear on the 
radio every day. It’s as if rappers com-
pletely gave up.
The song “PMW (All I Really Need),” 
which stands for “P---y Money Weed,” is the poster child for present-day rap.
As a whole, “Long.Live.A$AP” 
sounds like A$AP Rocky took a little bit of underground style, threw in some Lil Wayne-esque lyrics and called 
it a day.
It’s not as if A$AP Rocky is a bad 
rapper. He’s actually good. His words 
flow fluidly, and the lyrics are poetic.
The problem is the lyrical poetry 
sounds like A$AP Rocky took it from the pages of “Fifty Shades of Grey.”
The only good verses on the album come from the guest vocalists. Yet, the “big star” on the album, Drake in “F--kin’ Problems,” was an absolute failure. It seems he couldn’t think of anything 
original for his feature, so he grabs a 
lick from an old Nelly song: “Drop down and get your eagle on.”
The best song from the album, “Wild 
For the Night,” which 
Skrillex produced, is full of good vibes and flows smoothly. Sadly, though, the 
song plays like an 
Odd Future ripoff, 
using a deep vocal modifier that sounds extremely close to 
Tyler, The Creator’s therapist alter-ego from “Bastard” and “Goblin.”
“Wild For the Night” isn’t the only 
song to use the modifier, either. The al-
bum is flooded with it.
In the end, the album isn’t techni-
cally bad. The production and beats 
are pretty close to perfect throughout, and A$AP Rocky is a good rapper. At 
the same time, the album is bad. It’s 
the same lyrics you’ve heard again and again.
If you appreciate good rap produc-
tion, pick this up. If you’re looking for something new, I’d skip this one, because “Long.Live.A$AP” won’t live long on top.‘Long.Live.A$AP’: No. 1 on 
the chart, not in our heartsmusic

Dear Friend,
Because it is the anniversary of your birth, you have naturally high expecta-
tions, and that’s a problem. Some people think what happens on their birthdays 
is equivalent to the value of their life. False! The amount of people who tell you happy birthday, or even remember your birthday, does not mean anything. But if your parents forget, it’s OK to cry. The significance of remembering birthdays is just like anniversaries. Just because your boyfriend forgot your anniversary does not mean he doesn’t care about you. It means he doesn’t remember the first time you guys had sex in the bathroom at the Outback Steakhouse. Don’t make birthday plans a big deal. Never make a reservation for 20 people at a restaurant because you think you have 19 friends. Nobody has 19 closest friends they want to have dinner with. At least half of them will not show. It’s awkward and crowded, and you really only get to talk to four people in hear-ing distance when the person you want birthday sex from is all the way at the end of the table. Don’t even get me started on separate checks. Birthday plans should be simple. Spend the night with two to three people you can stand, and 
do something nice for yourself. Dear Friend,
Everyone is stupid. The reason why we know this is due to the Internet. People 
are overconfident when they post things on Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr and other who-gives-a-s--t media. A couple of decades ago, this wasn’t an issue, because there was no social network to post mind-numbing stupidity on. Phones were the size of bricks. Where the hell did Zack Morris keep his dinosaur phone — his back pocket? His acid-washed jeans and ass were too tight for that. He wasn’t able to tweet things like, “Damn, Kelly Kapowski is looking fine today. Does Bayside even have a dress code? #superfineallthetime” or, “loser in front of me doesn’t own a shirt with sleeves. Get a haircut @ACSlater.” Now, anytime someone has a meaningless opinion about anything, it takes seconds to put it on the Internet without a moment to ponder if what he or she posted was the dumbest thing ever thought. Twitter is a nightmare. Remember that time Bon Iver won a Grammy and hundreds of people thought he was a science teacher and that his name was Bonnie Bear? There needs to be at least a 12-hour period to consider what you are thinking and whether it is 
worthy to put on any social media site, because it’s probably not.

Tyler Hale had maple gravy sauce 
dripping from his mouth and beard as 
he took a ﬁ  rm bite into his chicken-and-
wafﬂ  e slider, a crisp piece of chicken 
between two ﬂ  uffy wafﬂ  es covered in sauce. Hale, 24, of Gainesville, is a regular customer at the Pelican Broth-
ers Food Truck.
“The chicken and wafﬂ  es are a 
staple of American culture,” he said. 
“Ever since my ﬁ  rst chicken and waf-ﬂ  e, I’ve never looked back.”
Gainesville residents can look for-
ward to this and other unique foods at Gainesville’s ﬁ  rst ever Food Truck Ral-
ly this Saturday at 7 
p.m. in the High Dive 
parking lot, located at 210 SW Second Ave. 
The free event is 
hosted by Pelican 
Brothers Food Truck 
and Glory Days Pres-
ents.
Chicken and wafﬂ  es and the ghetto 
burger are constant items on the Peli-can Brothers’ menu due to their popu-larity, said Matt Holmes, 32, co-owner of the Pelican Brothers Food Truck. The truck’s custom menu for the rally 
includes fried green tomato, bacon 
and cheddar biscuits, jerk chicken que-sadillas, grouper tacos, sweet potato 
fries and s’more-style egg rolls. The 
s’more-style egg roll is a dessert made with marshmallows, graham crackers and deep-fried egg roll.
In addition to Pelican Brothers, 
other participating food trucks include Go Go Stuff Yourself, Grilled Cheese Wagon, Humble Pie, Off the Griddle and La Lola Loca. Both vegan and vegetarian options 
will be available. High Dive will be serving drinks at its fully-stocked beer, wine and liquor bar outside.
Steven Che, a 20-year-old freshman 
majoring in dietetics, said street food is 
one of his favorite things in the world.
“I think food trucks offer a lot more 
variety, especially at a rally, because 
you can try one food truck and then 
another,” he said. “At a restaurant, 
you’re limited to just that one place.”
Prices at the Pelican Brothers Food 
Truck range from $3 to $7. Holmes said if people plan on trying different 
foods, they should bring around $15 to 
$20.
Holmes said 2,050 people are in-
vited to attend the event on Facebook, 
but he isn’t sure how many people will 
actually show up.Mike Riska, 30, co-owner of Pelican 
Brothers Food Truck and head chef at The Jones Eastside, said they are pre-pared for about 500 people to come out and eat.
La Lola Loca, a Latin American 
fusion food truck, will also be at the rally. It’s well-known for its taco’dilla, which is a quesadilla topped with the taco ﬁ  lling of choice, lettuce, tomatoes 
and a tangy chipotle aioli sauce.
According to the press release, the

Avenue Writer
We are almost through January, and gyms 
across campus are still packed with sneaker-
clad New Year’s resolutioners armed with wa-
ter bottles and iPod “workout zone” playlists.
But if your health-related resolution was to 
eat more fruits and vegetables, juicing might 
be the perfect solution. Although it’s probably 
not any easier than eating a fruit or vegetable 
whole, juicing might be a simple, more interest-ing way to include these necessary food groups in your diet.  
An at-home juicer can cost from $50-$200, or 
pre-juiced cleanses from companies like Blue-print ($55-$75) can be delivered to your home. Below is a recipe for Green Juice that will pro-vide calcium, vitamins and minerals, as well as 
aid in digestion. It may look gross, but it will 
taste delicious. Drink up!

Gators in the NBA
Former UF center Joakim Noah scored 10 points and 
grabbed 18 rebounds in Chicago’s 85-82 win against Detroit on Wednesday night.  KATIE AGOSTIN
 Alligator Staff Writer
  ATHENS, Ga. — For the past 
four years, Georgia has put up 
a ﬁ  ght at home against Florida. 
Wednesday night was no excep-
tion. 
  In the Gators’ past four trips to 
Athens, Ga., they only came home 
with a win once, defeating Geor-
gia 104-91 in double overtime on Jan. 25, 2011.
  Early in Wednesday’s game, 
Florida looked like it was going to 
return to Gainesville with its ﬁ  rst 
loss in Southeastern Conference play. 
But thanks to a game-high 17 
points on 7-of-9 shooting from junior Scottie Wilbekin, the No. 8 Gators (15-2, 5-0 SEC) defeated the Bulldogs (7-11, 1-4 SEC) 64-47 in Stegeman Coliseum.“We knew they were going to 
come out with a lot of pride and a lot of passion with playing in front 
of their home crowd,” Wilbekin 
said. “But I don’t think we did a good job of being ready for how hard they were going to come out, 
and I think we did a better job in 
the second half.”  
  The Bulldogs got off to a quick 
6-0 start when their leading scorer, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, made 
a three with 18:11 remaining in the 
ﬁ  rst half. Georgia’s lead grew to 11-2, but Florida responded. 
  Starting with guard Mike Rosa-
rio’s layup with 15:32 remaining in the ﬁ  rst half, the Gators scored eight points in the span of four possessions. 
  Still, it wasn’t enough for Flori-
da to reclaim the lead. 
  The Gators had won their four 
SEC games by an average mar-gin of 26.8 points but ﬁ  nished Wednesday’s ﬁ  rst half with a three-point deﬁ  cit. 
  “In the ﬁ  rst half they played 
harder than us,” guard Kenny 
Boynton said. “Our intensity 
changed in the second half, and we got after it.”
Wilbekin added: “We knew 
what happened last year, and we didn’t want that to happen again, so we just tried to push through.”
  Florida came to life in the sec-
ond half. 
  After leading the Gators with 
13 points on 6-for-7 shooting in the ﬁ  rst half, Wilbekin tied the game at 27 by netting a three with 
18:59 remaining. Less than a min-
ute later, Florida forced a turnover from Caldwell-Pope, and a Rosa-rio three gave the Gators their ﬁ  rst lead with 18:11 left in the second 
half. 
“It felt like it was back to nor-

 UF rebounds from slow start in win
  PHILLIP HEILMAN
 Alligator Staff Writer 
 
  Coach Amanda Butler and the Gators are looking to make a 
second consecutive appearance in the NCAA Tournament. 
  To accomplish the feat, Florida must follow the blueprint it 
created last season: consistently win against lesser competition and hold its own against the nation’s elite. 
  Florida ﬁ  nished the regular season 19-12 a year ago and 
earned a No. 9 seed. Against teams that ﬁ  nished with an RPI of 50 or better, the Gators were just 3-11. But UF’s consistent success against the rest of the country earned the team a trip to the NCAA Tournament. 
  Florida was 16-1 against teams with an RPI worse than 50, 
ﬁ  nishing the season with the nation’s 14th-ranked strength of 
schedule and an RPI of 41. 
  This season, results have been similar. 
  Butler’s squad is just 1-5 against teams with an RPI of 50 
or better, but the Gators are 12-1 against all other teams. Ari-zona State is the only team with an RPI worse than 50 to defeat  Gators hope to 
boost tourney odds
JURNY DUTY
  No one was surprised when defensive tackle Sharrif Floyd and safety Matt 
Elam announced their intentions to forgo their senior seasons and declare for the NFL draft.
  No one criticized their deci-
sions because both juniors ex-celled in 2012.
Floyd consistently de-
manded multiple blockers and closed gaps, while Elam was a 
gamechanger against both the 
run and pass. Both started every game for Florida.
  Jelani Jenkins didn’t.
He missed four games and left 
two others due to thumb, ham-
string and foot injuries. Many have questioned his decision to 
head to the NFL early because of 
his injury-shortened junior sea-son. 
Shouldn’t he come back to 
school next year and prove he can stay on the ﬁ  eld all season?  Despite these legitimate con-
cerns, Jenkins made the right call.
  NFL offenses are passing more 
than ever before. Tight ends are a major part of most of the league’s best offenses.
  Last season in the NFL, six 
tight ends ﬁ  nished in the top 30 
in catches. Both Dallas’ Jason Wit-
ten and Atlanta’s Tony Gonzalez were in the top 10.  Not among those six is New England’s two-
headed monster, Aaron Hernan-
dez and Rob Gronkowski.
  In 2002, Jeremy Shockey 
ranked 25th in the league with 74  Linebacker right to leave

said.  
After shooting 11.1 percent behind the arc in the first half, 
Florida made 63.6 percent of its threes on 7-for-11 shooting in the second.
The Gators outscored the Bulldogs 40-20 during the final 20 
minutes.
Erik Murphy scored 13 points during the second half after 
being held scoreless in the first. 
Florida’s defense also 
improved in the second half, holding UGA to only 
one three-point attempt.
Overall, Florida allowed only 47 points, making Georgia 
the ninth team to score fewer than 50 against the Gators this 
season.
“You look down at the stat sheet, and they’re shooting over 
50 percent from three,” coach Billy Donovan said. “I knew they were going to come out like that. I give our guys some credit. We made some adjustments in terms of guarding some pick and rolls, because I thought our coverage was a little bit late, 
and they hurt us in some of those situations.”
Florida remains one of two teams in the SEC that are unde-
feated in conference play, which Donovan credits to Wilbekin’s 
performance, the nine turnovers Florida forced in the first half 
and its defense in the second half.
“We probably should’ve been down by a much, much larger 
margin (in the first half),” Donovan said.
“I thought it was their nine turnovers and Wilbekin’s 13 
points that really kept us close in the game. … “Our guys did an outstanding job in the second half defensively. That was 
key.”  
Contact Katie Agostin at kagostin@alligator.org.receptions. He was the only tight end in the top 30.
Linebackers who are strong in 
pass coverage are at a premium because of the growing signifi-cance of the tight end.
Those coverage skills aren’t 
going to abandon Jenkins unless he has to undergo serious knee surgery.
The broken foot and broken thumb he suffered last season aren’t likely to be chronic or re-curring issues.
Jenkins made the right deci-
sion to leave college and avoid the risk of a career-threatening injury before his first payday. 
“He’s the best cover linebacker 
in college football today,” ESPN NFL Draft analyst Todd McShay said in October.
“Great speed and instincts and 
anticipation in coverage. He’s picking the right time to go to the NFL with so much focus on be-ing able to cover in the passing 
game.”
ESPN ranked Jenkins the 
third-best outside linebacker in 
the draft and has projected him 
to be the second-best linebacker 
available after the first round. 
With a good  showing at the 
NFL Scouting Combine on Feb. 20-26, Jenkins could solidify him-
self as a second- or third-round 
pick.
Jenkins would have been tak-
ing a risk had he elected to return 
to a defense replacing two start-
ers at the safety, linebacker and defensive tackle positions.
Unless several inexperienced 
players who are being thrust into 
starting roles show significant 
improvement, the odds are Flor -
ida’s defense will regress at least a little bit in 2013. 
Elam and Josh Evans wouldn’t 
be covering ground behind Jen-kins.
Floyd and Omar Hunter 
wouldn’t be around to take up 
space in front of him.
Jon Bostic wouldn’t be around 
to help Jenkins make the defen-
sive calls. 
Jenkins would have been 
forced to take on a significantly increased burden in keeping the defense on track.
Expecting his play not to drop 
off would have been unreason-able.
Although his final college sea-
son might not have been as ful-
filling as he had hoped, Jenkins is 
doing the right thing by not giv-ing it another try.

Jelani Jenkins (3) returns an interception during Florida’s 37-26 win 
against Florida State on Nov. 24 at Doak Campbell Stadium.
Florida finished 3-11 against teams 
among the RPI top 50 last season
Florida, doing so in a 74-58 victory in Las Vegas on 
Nov. 25. 
Entering Thursday, Florida’s RPI was 45, and the 
Gators ranked 37th in strength of schedule. 
“We have to get it a lot lower than that,” Carlie 
Needles said of UF’s RPI. “We have to believe in each other, and we have to believe in a common goal.” 
Florida’s blueprint makes tonight’s game against 
Ole Miss at 7 in the O’Connell Center critical. 
First-year Rebels coach Brett Frank inherited a 
nightmarish situation during the offseason. 
Former Ole Miss coach Adrian Wiggins was fired 
on Oct. 22 after the school investigated allegations of impermissible recruiting contact and academic mis-conduct by two of his assistant coaches. 
Ole Miss self-imposed a postseason ban this year 
after dismissing Wiggins as well as assistants Kenya and Michael Landers. 
The Rebels have since stumbled to a 7-11 record, 
including a five-game losing streak to begin South-eastern Conference play. 
Florida can ill afford to blemish its resume with a 
loss to Ole Miss. The Rebels have an RPI of 274 and have looked overmatched in conference play. 
Needles said UF understands the importance of 
taking care of business at home but admitted the Gators could be in for a battle despite the two teams’ 
differing records. 
“Even though Ole Miss hasn’t won a conference 
game yet, they really have nothing to lose,” Needles 
said. “That makes them a really, really dangerous 
team. They’re just playing for each other, and that’s 
really scary.” 
Butler refuses to label the matchup a trap game. 
She has spent the week imploring her team to pre-pare as it would for any other conference opponent. 
Despite Ole Miss floundering near the bottom 
of the conference, Butler knows one misstep could greatly damage her team’s chances of earning a berth in the NCAA Tournament. 
“[The Rebels] are a team that plays fearlessly, and 
it probably is because they have nothing to lose,” Butler said. “[Ole Miss] is really impressive with how inspired they are. We’ve got to handle our busi-ness.”

The Florida lacrosse team flew 
under the radar in 2012, surprising 
the nation by winning the American Lacrosse Conference championship for the first time and making its first 
Final Four appearance.
Now, opponents have the Gators 
circled on their schedule.
“It’s definitely really exciting, 
but it’s also scary having a target on your back all the time,” senior Kitty 
Cullen said. “We have now become one of the top contending teams.”
Florida finished 19-3 in 2012 and 
only lost to top-10 teams. That suc-
cess has generated high expecta-
tions for the No. 3 Gators in 2013: national championship or bust.
Florida coach Amanda O’Leary 
said that’s the position she wants her team to be in.
“You always want to be in a po-
sition to win a national champion-ship,” O’Leary said. “That’s what you are out here to do, and that’s what we do as coaches and players. That’s our expectations.”
The Gators’ expectations are not 
typical for a program that began only four years ago. With a record of 45-15 in its first three seasons, Florida has earned elite status, and 
opposing teams have taken notice.
“It’s exciting always having the 
target on your back,” O’Leary said. 
“Every team is going to put their 
best effort forth when they play us, and I 
think that’s a different feel for our team. But they’re one to embrace 
that challenge.”
The players are not only pre-
pared to step up to the challenge, 
they have yearned for the challenge all along.
“If you don’t have [a target on 
your back], you’re not doing any-thing right,” Cullen said. “You want to be a team that people want to 
beat, and you want to be a team that people are scared of.”
Florida will play the English 
national team in an exhibition on 
Thursday at 6:30 p.m. at Dizney Sta-dium. 
Cullen believes that being a top-
tier team is a perk of playing for the Gators.“Being the University of Florida, 
we always have a target on our back, and it’s kind of a cool thing,” Cullen said.16, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, JANUARY 24, 2013

Though the Florida tennis team kicked 
off its season Saturday, senior Bob van 
Overbeek had to wait until Wednesday 
night to get on the court.
In his first match of the year, he made 
a statement.
Van Overbeek won both his singles and 
doubles match as No. 12 Florida (2-0) se-
cured a 7-0 win against UCF (1-2) at Linder Stadium.
Defeating the Knights’ Jose Sangroniz 
in two sets 6-0, 6-1, took van Overbeek 
only 45 minutes.The five other singles matches lasted an 
average of 1 hour and 18 minutes.
“Bob did a great job of being the cata-
lyst for the team in his first match this sea-
son for us,” coach Bryan Shelton said in a release.
“I was happy to see him not only start 
the match well, but finish it off well. I thought overall we just played solid tennis and competed well.”
Van Overbeek, currently ranked No. 51 
in the ITA singles rankings, didn’t have the fall season he hoped for.
He began the season ranked No. 17 in 
the nation and won his first three matches before spiraling downward. 
He went 7-6 the rest of the fall season. 
His last win without dropping at least four 
games was on Oct. 19, when he crushed FGCU’s Dean Tsamas 6-0, 6-0.
A strong start is some-
thing Florida will need from its senior leader, 
considering van Over -
beek played as the No. 1 singles player most of 
last season.
He played as the No. 3 singles player 
against the Knights.Doubles was much of the same for van 
Overbeek. After switching between four different doubles partners in the fall, van Overbeek finished with a record of 3-5.
But by the end of the fall campaign, he 
had found his partner — junior Stephane 
Piro. 
Piro and van Overbeek led the charge 
in doubles on Wednesday, beating UCF’s 
Francesc Aulina and Jorge Blasco 8-1.
The Gators will be back on the court 
this weekend when it hosts the 2013 ITA Kick-Off Weekend.
