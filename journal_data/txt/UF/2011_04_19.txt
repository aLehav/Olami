FREEDOM OF THE HEBREWS FROM SLAVERY IN EGYPT.
By JESSICA KEGU
Alligator Contributing Writer 
Wine and matzah were abound 
and cellphones were off at the Lubavitch-Chabad Jewish Student and Community Center Monday evening for the celebration of the Passover Seder. 
About 300 people attended the 
Seder, which  marks the first night of the Jewish holiday that com -
memorates the deliverance of the Hebrews from slavery in Egypt. 
William McKell, a UF sopho-
more who isn’t Jewish, said he has six papers and exams due in the next few days but appreciates tak-ing a break from all of it to attend the dinner
“I’m not even Jewish, but I real-
ly love the whole message of Pass-over — the idea of inclusion and overcoming oppression,” he said. 
Every table had a plate of tradi-tional Seder foods along with bot-tles of wine, grape juice and soda.  
Nearly every male head was adorned with a white yarmulke and groups of students arrived together to sit and take part in the traditions of the evening. 
Rabbi Berl Goldman, who of-
ficiated the evening’s festivities,  invited everyone to participate in the rituals. 
“Tonight you are going to make 
this happen, “ he said. “Each and every one of us is going to fulfill 
the Seder together.” 
Rosalind Sobel, 27, 
and her mother, Lila, reunited at the Seder 
to spend their Passover together.
 “It’s really important every 
year to hear the story with your family if you can,” said the young-er Sobel, whose mother drove up from West Palm Beach to celebrate Passover.
Mallory Zuckerman, a UF pub-
lic relations senior, said the dinner acts as a great way for students to celebrate a religious tradition away 
from home. 
Moonwalking Romanian lawmaker told to put dance shoes away 
BUCHAREST, Romania — A moonwalk-
ing politician might not be the best reason to 
pay attention to Romanian politics, but the antics seem to be working.
Edmond Talmacean, a 40-year-old Bucha-
rest politician, has inspired national headlines with his Michael Jackson-inspired moonwalk on a television show and his impersonations of the late dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. “Danc-ing is another kind of political message to ap-peal to the younger generation, that it is good to have fun ... that you can go to a disco and dance,” Talmacean said.
Party bosses, however, say enough is 
enough and have ordered him to tone down.
Prime Minister Emil Boc declared the 
routine was more suited to “showbiz” than politics.
Talmacean promised Monday to keep a 
low profile until party elections next month but says he has no regrets.

Hundreds gather for Passover celebration
By HANNAH WINSTON
Alligator Writer
Ashton Charles sat front row in 2008 for the 
“Don’t Tase Me Bro” incident.
She has a hot dog named after her at Gator 
Dawgs. 
And she’s a vegan who used to eat a cheese-
burger every time she’d go out with friends.
But you probably know her as your Stu-
dent Body president. 
After a year serving the highest student of-
fice, her term is complete on Wednesday . On 
April 29, she’ll have earned a master’s degree in management. In August, she’ll be working in the U.S. Embassy in Madrid. 
But even though all the paperwork is 
signed and complete, she knows her time in Gainesville never will be.
These days, Charles’ office on the third 
floor of the Reitz Union is quiet. A birthday balloon, which has floated around since Janu-ary , droops closer to the floor as the helium leaves its once robust frame. Copies of the newspaper sit in high stacks on a back desk, waiting to be revisited and then clipped for a scrapbook.
n n n
All Charles ever wanted for Christmas was 
to go to the Vatican with her family for the 
holiday season. 
But during the fall of 2006, when she was a 
freshman, she got a phone call from her moth-
er. Charles was given a choice: Go to the Vati-can for Christmas, or head to the BCS National Championship game in Glendale, Ariz.  
The lifelong, Sunday Mass-attending Cath-
olic didn’t have to think twice. 
To this day , jumping on the seats of the 
University of Arizona Stadium with her sister, 
Summer, after the Gators won the National 
Championship against Ohio State University was the one of the best moments of her life.
Originally, though, she wasn’t going to 
be a Gator. Summer went to UF and Charles wanted to go somewhere else. But it was UF that accepted her first. Every other college ac-ceptance after, she said, was anti-climactic. 
Now her office is covered in Gator para-
phernalia, including heirloom lamps and Gator picture frames.
But orange and blue aren’t the only colors 
in the office. Navy, blue and gray are incorpo-rated to represent her Student Government party, the Unite Party.
Her rise in SG was no surprise to those who 
know her. Her sister said her family teases her 
about the possibility of her becoming the first woman president of the U.S.
She said Charles is 
very competitive but is the kindest person she knows. It’s the competitive nature that pushes her to meet goals and win elections. 
Throughout high school, she played seven 
varsity sports and competitive soccer on the side. Her flag football team was undefeated her senior year.  
She doesn’t take losing lightly, though los-
ing isn’t something that happens often. Charles progressed quickly from student 
senator to senate president, and then on to becoming the fourth elected female Student 
Body President at UF, and the fifth overall 
since the creation of SG in 1909 and the admis-sion of women to the university in 1948. 
Charles is also one of the few Student Body 
Presidents to completely finish her party’s platform. 
The Unite Party’s platform included ex-
panding bus routes, putting hand sanitizers across campus and installing Redboxes so stu-
dents could rent DVDs.
But the president’s job wasn’t done. 
“It’s not just a platform; it’s about repre-
senting the students at all times and being prepared for other things that do come up and that you do encounter unexpectedly ,” she said.
The unexpected was block tuition. She remembered her predecessor, Jordan 
Johnson, sarcastically wishing her good luck 
when there was a proposed 15 percent in-
crease in tuition two days before she took of-fice last summer. Student Body President reflects as she leaves office

Pet pig returned to Pa. couple by town officials
FOLSOM, Pa. — A wayward 
pet pig whose residency was 
challenged by Pennsylvania 
township officials has been re-
turned to his owners.
A Vietnamese micro-pot-
bellied pig named Steve was 
reunited with Brian Maguire 
and Bernadette Broadhurst on Friday. 
Broadhurst says a Ridley 
Township commissioner per -
sonally delivered the animal, days after he’d been taken to a farm by police. Maguire says Steve had apparently escaped 
from his yard and disappeared. 
When he checked with police 
to see if the animal had been 
spotted, Maguire says he was told it was found but sent to a 
farm because of a township ban 
on keeping farm animals.
Maguire said he feared for 
the 6-pound, 10-week-old pig’s safety in a farm setting.

Man bites dog, sues over 
police canine’s act
PHOENIX — A 33-year-old 
man who bit back after he was 
caught by a Phoenix police dog is 
suing police.
Erin Sullivan alleges the dog 
violated his civil rights and used 
excessive force to capture him af-
ter he ran from officers in Glen-
dale during a burglary investiga-tion last year. Police say Sullivan bit the dog back, injuring it.
The lawsuit names the cities 
of Phoenix and Glendale and four officers. The lawsuit seeks $200,000 from Glendale and $250,000 from Phoenix.
Officials in Glendale and 
Phoenix have declined comment.
Sullivan also alleges Glen-
dale police refused to give him insulin to treat his diabetes. Sul-
livan’s attorney has said his cli-
ent suffered a diabetic seizure in a Glendale cell. Sullivan is serving eight years for convic-
tions in the Glendale burglary.

8-foot ‘corpse flower’ set 
to bloom in Ohio
COLUMBUS, Ohio —  
Spring is in the air, and that means an unpleasant smell for 
one greenhouse at Ohio State 
University.
An 8-foot-tall rain forest 
plant that’s known as a “corpse flower” because it smells like rotting flesh is getting ready to bloom. The Columbus Dispatch reports greenhouse coordinator Joan Leonard has been grow-ing the flowers since 2001, and this would be the first of five to bloom.
Leonard says smelling the 
Amorphophallus titanium for the first time will be the culmi-nation of a decade of work. 
But it will be a quick experi-
ence because the flower withers after a day or two.
She expects the bloom to 
open in May, revealing its umbrella-sized “petals.” When that happens, the university will have visiting hours to give people a peek at the rare plant.

The design is not based on

n HER JOURNEY WILL BE 
MORE THAN 3,500 MILES.
By ALLISON BANKO 
Alligator Writer
Grace Tidwell’s experience 
on two wheels didn’t expand beyond pedaling her “cheap” bike to get to class. 
But the 22-year-old UF 
graduate is now gearing up for a trek much farther than any one Gainesville’s bike lanes have to offer. 
Tidwell, a food science and 
human nutrition major who graduated last year, has been selected to ride 3,588 miles from North Carolina to Califor -
nia with Bike and Build, a non-profit organization that helps construct affordable housing 
for low-income families.
The organization accepts 
young adults between the 
ages of 18 and 24 who pledge 
to raise $4,000 to benefit or -
ganizations, such as Habitat for Humanity and Neighbor -
Works, while riding along one 
of its routes during the sum-
mer months. 
She has raised money for 
the trip by sending out letters 
and receiving donations from 
people who read her Facebook 
page and blog. Premiere De-
signs, a jewelry company she paired with for a fundraiser, has been donating half of its sales to the cause.
From May 13 through July 
17, Tidwell will pedal across eight states, making stops along the way to help build homes and host presentations to raise awareness about hous-ing issues.
Bicyclists will wake up at 
about 6 a.m. each day and will be required to arrive at their destination by 4 p.m. They will be provided with meals and will camp out or stay at churches, community centers 
or schools along the way. 
Tidwell, a current first-year 
medical student at the Univer -
sity of South Florida, said this 
year marks her last “free” sum-
mer without school or work-
ing in clinics, and she wanted 
to do something meaningful 
with it. 
“Housing is one of the most 
basic human needs and it’s a big problem for people in the 
U.S.,” she said. “I think that 
it’s an issue that should be im-portant to everyone.” To meet her financial goal,  
she has been volunteering with Habitat for Humanity in 
Pinellas County since Febru-
ary, which she has chosen to receive a portion of the funds 
she has raised.
She was told to pack light; 
she is only able to take one 
duffel bag that will be housed in a van full of supplies follow-
ing the riders. 
“It’s going to be really 
funny,” she said. “I’m totally 
a girly girl. But I’ll be able to tough it out.”  4, ALLIGATOR n TUESDAY, APRIL 19, 2011

UF alumna to bike across US

It costs Damien Gilliams 40 
cents more per gallon to fill up his 
scooter in Gainesville than when he’s home in Sebastian. 
To put it frankly, the UF fresh-
man said he thinks gas prices “suck.”
“They’re really high,” he said 
as he watched $4.22-per-gallon supreme gasoline flow out into his tank.
In Alachua County , 12 cents 
is added per gallon to fund road projects, said Mark Sexton, county 
communications coordinator. And 
that doesn’t include a 6.8-cent State Comprehensive Enhanced Transportation System Tax that’s the same in every county except Franklin County, which has a 5.8-cent tax.
In Marion County , county taxes 
are 12 cents, too. In Gilchrist Coun-
ty , the tax is 7 cents. In Levy and 
Bradford Counties, it’s 6 cents.
David Denslow, UF professor 
of economics, said he’s heard ev-erything from ideas that gas sta-tions crank up the prices to cheat college students to the notion of fuel monopolies on highways.
But the fact of the matter, he 
said, is gas prices fluctuate wildly based on the price of oil. Turmoil in oil-rich Middle East countries increases prices, he said, as does China’s growing demand for gas.
Prices are also subject to specu-
lation, the idea of basing today’s prices on tomorrow’s supply.
However, one concrete element 
within gas bills is government gas taxes. 
“Some people have the miscon-
ception that when gas taxes shoot up it’s the fault of the county,” Sex-ton said. “The truth is it would be 12 cents whether gas was 30 cents or $5.”
Federal, state and county taxes 
add about 50 cents per gallon to your bill, but John Oliver, manager of a Chevron gas station on 53rd Street and 43rd Avenue, said the county typically gets the blame.
“I’ve never heard so much hoo-
ha about taxes,” he said. “What do the taxes do? They fix roads.”
Six county road projects that 
were funded by gas taxes were fin-ished last year, totaling more than $1 million in project costs. Twen-ty-two other projects have been finished since 2006, and about 15 more are in the works.
The Alachua County Commis-
sion added a 5-cent gas tax that 
went into effect in 2008, which 
brought in more than $14 million 
from 2008 to 2010.
Oliver said the 
new taxes don’t af-fect his business. 
He said he remembers a time 
when a 1-cent tax would cause a run to the pumps, but those days 
are long gone.
He said people will pay for the 
gas, and he thinks they should pay 
the government their fair share of taxes — at least as long as the government spends the money 
wisely.
“Now what they spend it on is 
another story,” he said.
Cadmus McCarty , manager 
of a Chevron gas station on 34th 
Street and University Avenue, said his customers will pay despite new gas taxes, but more taxes chip away the respect he has for his 
county representatives.
“They keep adding more and 
more taxes, and no one knows 
where the money’s going that we’re already sending them,” he said. “They just want more and more.”Drivers frustrated by 
taxes at the pump

An orange cab pulls up to the curb and 
puts the hazard lights on. Passengers scramble 
in and take their seats in the middle or back rows.
The van, for all outward appearances, looks 
like a normal taxi.
The ceiling light suddenly flashes, illumi-
nating the interior of the cab. A bright green 
bike light hangs from the rear view mirror blinking rapidly , setting the front of the cab 
aglow.
“Congratulations! You’ve just stepped into 
the Chocolate Cab,” Mark, the cab driver, an-
nounces to passengers. “Would you like to an-
swer some trivia questions for chocolate?”
He is the driver of Chocolate Cab, one of 
the taxi cabs in the Gator Taxicab service in Gainesville. He rolls around the city streets 
Thursday through Sunday evenings stopping for lucky passengers. 
Mark has created Gainesville’s own version 
of “Cash Cab,” a popular Discovery Channel 
show where passengers can win prizes if they 
answer random trivia questions correctly. “Tonight’s topic is on the popular docu-
mentary ‘Super Size Me,’” he says. “First question: What percent of adults in America are overweight?” 
A set of four answers follow. Choice D, 
60 percent, is right. He flickers the lights and says, “That’s correct!”
A small Hershey’s nugget is awarded for 
the right answer. 
He selects the 12-ounce variety packs of 
Hershey’s chocolates from the Dollar Store to use for his prize supply . He goes through about two-thirds of the bag per night.
He draws his questions from three cat-
egories — the current “Harper’s Index,” an 
anthropologist’s book titled “Why Him? Why 
Her?” and the documentary “Super Size Me.”
“I’m not a big fan of trivia,” Mark said. “To 
me, it’s useless knowledge. I find things that are informative and entertaining.” 
Chocolate Cab began about three months 
ago when Mark finally took his 2 a.m. pas-sengers’ inquiries seriously as to whether they 
entered the Cash Cab. 
The repeated questions made him think 
about a way he could base a game off the show without losing money in the process, he said.
He’s had about 350 passengers participate in the chocolate game, usually about eight pas-
sengers per night.
“I generally ask about 25 percent of my to-
tal rides for the night just based on the group,” Mark said. “Some people don’t speak English 
well or have a much shorter ride than others. 
Almost everyone I do ask says yes.” 
A couple of recent UF graduates were sur -
prised when they took the taxi back to their apartments one evening.
“We were leaving downtown, and there 
was a big group of us,” said Amy Whiteside. 
“We saw a van that could ac-commodate the group and went right in. Suddenly , his van lights 
flashed on and off, and he an-
nounced that we had stepped into the Choco-
late Cab. We were all pretty excited.”
She said everything was like “Cash Cab,” 
except that there weren’t lights on the ceiling.
“I mean, that would be an extreme,” Whi-
teside said. “I thought he was pretty profes-sional, though. I don’t think many people 
know about him yet.”
Kellie Cross, another Chocolate Cab con-
testant, was excited when she found out she was in the Chocolate Cab.
“It was our lucky night I guess,” Cross said. 
“We caught him Friday night before the Or -
ange and Blue game.”She said her group didn’t get any of the an-
swers right at first, but he gave them chocolate 
at the end of the ride anyway.
The diverse clientele always provides en-
tertainment for Mark.
“You’ll get some people who seem to pride 
themselves on being incredibly serious and 
good at trivia games,” he said, laughing. “You 
can almost hear the wheels turning when they don’t know an answer. They sit there ponder -
ing for long, silent moments. It’s fun to watch 
their faces in the mirror while they focus on 
figuring it out.”
Chocolate Cab contestants do still have 
to pay for their rides, but playing the game 
seems to take the riders’ minds off taxi prices. It’s a safe, fun alternative, he said.
Mark drives all over Gainesville accommo-
dating all passengers. He plans to announce the upcoming trivia topics on his website — chocolatecab.weebly .com — in case anyone 
would like to read up on the subjects.
Eventually Mark plans to put some lights 
in the seats and the floor so they can light up when people get in. 
“I’m not sure if my boss knows, actually ,” 
he said. “I’ve never told him, but other cab drivers know what I do and have wished me well. I like to liven up the ride for passen-
gers.”Local taxi driver creates sweeter version of Cash Cab

one-year anniversary of the Deepwater Ho-
rizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Although a year has passed, BP PLC still has some serious damage con-trol to do. Of course, the oil giant focused on keeping its company’s name and reputa-tion in tact during the crisis, which left many of us star -
ing, mouths agape at video of oil spewing out of the Earth. Scientists and econo-mists are giving us varied feedback on the outcome of 
the disaster. 
The wildlife certainly took 
a hit — just talk to workers 
on Louisiana’s oyster beds — but it’s recovering better than expected. Beach towns are seeing the number of vis-itors increase in the lead-up to the busy summer season. 
But the fishermen along the Gulf are being left high and dry by the public per -
ception that their food is poisoned, although even National Oceanic and Atmo-spheric Association has said that they haven’t seen any tainted fish on the market. Remember that PR campaign BP launched about how they were going to make every-thing right and help the peo-ple whose lives they helped ruin? How about fighting a war against the public’s misconceptions about Gulf seafood? It’s the least the 
company could do. After all, 
it’s gotten off pretty easy af-ter causing an economic and environmental disaster that was kicked off by the deaths of several workers.
If only BP was as fast to 
clean up all facets of this mess as it was to clean up its image. Trippe-ing Up
Scott’s lawyer misspoke 
on rail budget
You’d think it would be important to get the num-
bers right when you’re making a presentation about a budget of any kind. But when that argument is 
taking place in front of the Florida Supreme Court, and the money amounts you’re throwing around are in the mil-lions and billions, any “minor” mistake becomes a huge one. 
Welcome to the ridiculous world of Gov. Rick Scott’s 
general counsel, Charles Trippe, who just owned up to a $79-million mistake he made in an oral argument about high-speed rail in March. Instead of showing the state’s budget for the project at its actual $100 million, Trippe 
misspoke and said we had $21 million to pay with. His dis-
crepancy was at the root of Supreme Court justices’ deci-sion to pass on the petition for high-speed rail in the state, but it has been discovered only after the federal money 
that could have been used for the project has been doled 
out to other states.
Bravo. If this was a legitimate mistake and not an out-
right misrepresentation of facts, we’re wondering why the numbers weren’t double-checked. And if this was an effort 
to mislead the justices, well, we wouldn’t be surprised.
No matter the reason for the wrong number, we have 
to agree with Sen. Bill Nelson’s assessment of the prob-
lem: “It’s not possible at this point for Florida to get back 
the $2.4 billion or 24,000 jobs high-speed rail would have 
brought. It’s a shocking disappointment to learn all of that investment may have been lost because of a mistake or misrepresentation by the governor’s lawyer.”
Students tempted by pills during finals
Here’s the situation: Your exam is on Saturday and, 
let’s be honest, you never actually watched those 
Statistics lectures. You did most of the quizzes, at-
tended various labs and it’s all coming down to a careful calculation that says you must score at least an 85 on the fi-
nal for a B in the class. What’s the game plan? Wouldn’t it be nice if there were a pill that gave you a super brain blast 
allowing for hours of cramming without any of the pain? 
Forget getting a B, this pill would let you score high enough on the final to reach a nearly-impossible A. Well, that pill 
exists. In fact, many of those pills exist, and they go by vari-
ous names such as Adderall, Vyvanse and Ritalin. The day is finally here, folks. Tomorrow marks the end of the 2010-2011 
school year at UF, and the light at the end of the tunnel is so 
bright it’s almost blinding. Freshmen like me end our first year of college while seniors bid their college years adieu. For all of us, however, one pesky word separates us from 
our summers, and it starts with an F and ends with INALS. 
Library West is braced for stuffing to max capacity, and Star -
bucks has stocked its strongest espressos. No. 2 pencils at the ready UF; it’s finals time. How will you navigate these treacherous waters?
For many , the aforementioned pills are the answers to 
this question. These commonly prescribed drugs are sup-posed to help folks with ADHD calm down, focus and con-
trol their actions in a productive way . The problem is that 
it works on everybody . Students, who have discovered the benefits of these drugs, now have a perfect solution to their 
stressful academic times. The hours of necessary studying 
for colossal tests are made more enjoyable with the aid of a small pill. Liberally prescribed, their acquisition is no chal-lenge, and many students feel paying five bucks to a friend 
is worth the hours of productive studying they’ll gain. These 
“study” drugs all work by stimulating the brain’s produc-
tion of norepinephrine and dopamine, which are both asso-
ciated with behavior and attention. The drugs also cause the nervous system to run “quicker,” causing an elevated heart rate and 
jittery feelings. In combination, 
these effects can be very pleasing 
and allow for a certain high that 
students can enjoy while plowing through pages of mind-numbing 
study materials. If you’re a parent, 
you’re probably concerned about your kid right now. If you’re a stu-
dent, you probably know exactly what I’m talking about. The benefits of Adderall and Ritalin are hard to ignore, and if so many kids are prescribed them, why not? After all, athletes 
take steroids and rock stars snort crack, all in favor of perfor -
mance enhancement. Is it fair that my fellow test-takers get 
this study boost while I kick it old school?
Are these drugs a college student’s best friend or worst 
enemy? Thus far, I have failed to mention the common side effects of drugs like Adderall, which include insomnia, dry 
mouth and, as it seems with any drug these days, addiction. 
Not to mention the fraction of students who take these pills for recreation, enjoying the high they consequently experi-
ence and slowly come to rely on. Combine them with some 
alcohol on a Saturday night, and you’ll get a volatile mix. With finals imminent, many students will resort to study 
drugs as a trusty habit, while others will be introduced to 
them for the first time. As with any drug, it’s a personal choice, but be careful, Florida. Adderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse or 
whatever you’re popping may not be on par with crack or 
heroin, but they’re still not prescribed to you for a reason. As finals approach, I encourage you to resist the allure of study drugs, make some coffee, find (if you’re lucky) a spot in the 
library , and step your game up. Best of luck, people. We’re 
almost there.

Letters to the Editor
Rejecting drag and other sections of 
LBGT society disheartening
While an opinion is something to al-
ways be respected, it is hard to do so when 
the motives behind it somehow insult the efforts of a community as a whole. 
While many can agree and maybe 
support the sense of frustration a stereo-
type brings to anyone’s life, “UF’s Pride 
Student Union perpetuates LGBT stereo-types” by Jonothon Mitchell went beyond 
stating an adverse point of view and in-
stead attacked the sense of pride of many 
in our Student Body. 
While an event like the drag show “The 
Diva Wears Prada” was one that accentu-
ated many aspects that some homosexuals 
cannot identify with, it is important to re-
alize that the celebration of such is essen-
tial to the LGBTQ culture. 
The gathering of a group of people who 
might not choose to do the same thing but 
are always willing to commemorate those who do is not to be confused as a rally of 
sentiment with the means to encourage all 
to follow suit. 
It instead exemplifies the idea of his-
tory and tradition. 
Being part of a long line of struggles 
and stories, our community has chosen to celebrate the things that many have iden-
tified themselves with and have found 
comfort and happiness within. 
Although the intention is to celebrate 
those who do identify with the “drag” lifestyle, there were no announcements, 
encouragements or the slightest push to 
make anyone feel that this was the only 
way to be a proud homosexual. 
It is understood that the comfort levels 
of all vary, but to say that the celebration of such aspects of our community is an 
embarrassment to people of our kind is 
disheartening. 
Along with the drag show, Pride Aware-
ness Month advocated HIV testing. 
Should this also be a disgrace to Mitch-
ell because it also hints to the stereotype 
that all homosexual men contract the dis-ease? 
Or is it just another mission from the 
leaders of our culture to advocate for an 
issue that along with being scary is the re-
ality to many of us?
Should the same people who partici-
pated in the drag show Thursday boycott performances by Allison Weiss for also 
representing homosexuality in the way Mitchell did not intend to? 
Or is it the mission of Pride Student 
Union to give a sense of comfort to every 
single different approach to homosexual-ity that is represented in our university 
and our nation? 
To say that we choose to maintain a ste-
reotype is downright wrong. 
To say that we are embracing the cul-
ture as a whole, never leaving out the experience of anybody for being too far-
fetched or downright strange, is right. Like Mitchell, I am a gay man who 
has never been inclined to wear women’s clothing or carry the rainbow flag on my 
back at all times. 
It has,  however, become my mission 
to celebrate those who have been through the same struggles as I have and to make 
them feel at home. 
I would not leave out rednecks or 
Quakers from American culture, and even if it goes without saying that I would nev-
er choose to participate in either of those lifestyles, I would also never condemn a 
celebration of either as a sub-par repre-sentation of my American identity.

 No one should be judged for keeping 
with or rejecting gay stereotypes
Drag is a part of gay culture. 
Drag queens helped lead the Stonewall 
riots, and they undeniably shaped the gay rights movement. 
I can understand Jonothon Mitchell’s 
issue with drag shows and other “effemi-nate” things. 
Gay people grow up with everyone 
judging them before they even open their 
mouths. 
People assume they know what our hob-bies are and what music we listen to before they’ve even met us. Trust me. I understand.  
In many ways, I do not fit the stereotypi-
cal “gay” image. 
My major is aerospace engineering. I 
play soccer and I wakeboard. I’m also in a fraternity. 
But sometimes I also enjoy a good drag 
show. Or I might want to watch a chick flick. 
You should not be pressured into fol-
lowing the gay stereotype purely be-cause you are gay, but you should 
also not be discouraged from do-
ing an activity just because it seems  
“gay.”
I would love to see more gay engineer -
ing students but not if it comes at the ex-
pense of their freedom of personal expres-
sion.
I want people to choose what is 
right for them, with no thought for 
what stereotype they need to fit into  
or which one they need to avoid. 
When we let other people dictate what 
we can and cannot do, that is when we 
have lost ourselves. 
Pride Student Union is working to 
make it easier for all LGBTQ people to do what they want to do regardless of wheth-
er that is playing football or putting on 
glitter and stilettos.

Johnson said he was cleaning out his 
office when he got the email about the in-
crease. Charles had walked in after class, and Johnson laughed because the transi-tion was complete and it was her turn to take on the role of president.
“Finally, Ashton was going to under -stand what her life was going to be,” he said.
She didn’t know it then, but it would 
be a good test run for August, when block tuition was officially brought to the table.
Block tuition would charge a flat-rate 
tuition fee for 15 credit hours, no matter if students take 12 or 18 hours.
Charles couldn’t believe it. Night af-ter night she researched other university models, because she knew it was the only way she could fight back effectively . 
As the only student on the Board of 
Trustees, she was the sole student voice to speak for the Student Body . 
Whether it was all the research and 
hours Charles put into her argument, the student protests or a mix of the two, block tuition was postponed. 
And now that it has been stalled for a 
year, she can do more things she enjoys, 
like going to concerts with Student Body 
Vice President Marcus Dixon, where she prides herself on knowing more rap lyr -
ics than he does. 
“The more inappropriate a rap song 
is, the more I love it,” she said.
n n n
From Russia to Spain and vacationing 
in Costa Rica, she has traveled both as a diplomat and just another high school 
student with her Spanish class.
To say the least, Charles has been 
around. 
Now she’s taking her experience from 
UF, her fluency in Spanish and her love of 
the world on a one-way ticket to Austria. From there it’s a train ride to Madrid for a year of work at the U.S. embassy . 
Though Spanish is not her native 
language, she knew she could speak pretty well when she went to Spain in high school, and she was the designated speaker for the trip.
“I figure with Spanish and Chinese I 
can talk to one-third of the world,” she said.
Before she ventures to Spain, she’s go-
ing home to Kentucky to spend time with 
family, heading to West Virginia to spend 
some time with her father and taking a family vacation back to Costa Rica.  
During that time she has to sell her car, 
teach her grandparents how to use Skype and get used to the idea that she’s not coming back to The Swamp in August. 
But eventually, she will be back. She 
wants a family of her own at some point 
and UF has given her more than she can 
ever repay . 
So she’ll come back, excited for the fu-
ture like she was when she started fresh-man year.
“I love this state too much to be gone 
for too long,” Charles said. “I’m Kentucky by birth, Gator by the grace of God.” 8, ALLIGATOR n TUESDAY, APRIL 19, 2011

Alligator Staff Writer 
The Alachua County Sheriff’s Office and 
Gainesville Police Department are inves-
tigating  two separate Wendy’s burglaries 
from Monday morning that may be related.
Sometime between 10 p.m. Sunday 
and 6:30 a.m. Monday, both Wendy’s res-taurants, located  at 1711 N. Main St. and 
6700 W. Newberry Road respectively, were 
broken into and burglarized. According to ASO and GPD sources, an  undetermined 
amount of cash was taken from 
their safes.
GPD is investigating the 
burglary on North Main Street 
while the sheriff’s office is look-
ing into the one on West Newberry Road.
GPD spokeswoman Tscharna Senn said 
police believe the burglar or burglars pried open the North Main Street restaurant’s back door and cut the electrical and phone lines, 
hoping to disarm any alarm system. Offi-
cers with the sheriff’s office are still figuring out how the burglar or burglars entered the 
Wendy’s on West Newberry Road.
ASO spokesman Art Forgey said the bur -
glar or burglars may have snuck  in during 
an early morning delivery.
Forgey said officers are working hard to 
determine if the two burglaries may be re-lated and to pin down suspects, but noted that in a building with so many people in and out each day, it becomes harder to iden-
tify suspects through fingerprints.Gainesville

Reitz Union on Monday afternoon.
NewsLocalTHE ASSOCIATED PRESS
WASHINGTON — Three Washington Post photographers 
won a Pulitzer Prize on Monday for breaking news photogra-
phy in Haiti in the days and months following the country’s 
devastating earthquake.
Photographers Carol Guzy, Nikki Kahn and Ricky Carioti 
shared the prize and were cheered by dozens who gathered in the Post’s newsroom, where plastic champagne flutes lined a filing cabinet. The judges said their photos were an “up-close 
portrait of grief and desperation” following the catastrophic quake in January 2010.
“They are three exemplary photojournalists whose com-
passion comes through in their work,” Executive Editor Mar -
cus Brauchli said.
This was the fourth Pulitzer for Guzy, who had been cov-
ering Haiti long before the earthquake.
“I started my career covering Haiti, and my heart’s always 
been there,” she said. “That country’s been through so much 
torture ... over the years it just keeps getting slammed.”
For Guzy, one of the lasting images from her work over 
the past year was a photograph of a girl in a school uniform who had been crushed at her desk.
“She’s just the picture of innocence,” Guzy said. “We knew 
that the students were still sitting at their desks, so it was just 
a moment of people going about their daily lives and then boom, the earth trembled and life stopped.”
The win came 25 years after Guzy won her first Pulitzer 
Prize with Kahn’s husband, Michel duCille, at The Miami Herald. Now duCille is the Post’s photography director.
Post Co. Chairman Don Graham joined the newsroom cel-
ebration and hugged the photographers.
Kahn traveled back to Haiti several times after the earth-
quake, and Carioti documented the aftermath seven months after the quake.
“I think the amazing thing was the opportunity to go 
back throughout the year and check up on the people I pho-
tographed on the first trip,” Kahn said. “It was incredibly 
important to find the strength to go out and show the world what the Haitian people were going through.”
Carioti said he wanted to see the Pulitzer announcement 
online before he would believe he won.
“For me, I had never been to Haiti,” he said. “Just the shock of the conditions that people were living in seven months lat-
er. ... I’m sure it’s probably worse now.”
Washington Posts journalists also were finalists in two 
other categories: explanatory reporting and editorial writing.TUESDAY, APRIL 19, 2011 n ALLIGATOR, 9

Florida senior Bryson Smith made his return to the lineup this weekend against Georgia, batting leadoff and second in 
his two starts. Smith was suspended on March 14 after he was arrested and charged with driving under the influence.
UF LACROSSE
By JOHN BOOTHE
Alligator Writer
No matter how Florida’s year 
ends, the Gators can rest assured 
they will avoid at least one loss heading into the offseason.
UF’s roster should enter 2012 
unscathed.
At this time of the year, most 
teams are preparing to send off their seniors. Before Florida’s 8-7 win on Sunday, Vanderbilt held its Senior Day for six upperclass-men. In two weeks, Cornell will do the same for its two seniors.
The Gators, on the other hand, 
won’t have to say goodbye to a player for another year.“For the program, definitely 
it’s a good thing that we’ll have almost every single person re-turning for the next two years,” said Caroline Cochran, the team’s only junior.
Florida has done what most 
in women’s lacrosse thought was impossible: win the American La-crosse Conference with a second-year team comprised of Cochran, 10 freshmen and 16 sophomores. 
Before the season, the No. 
3 Gators (14-1, 5-0 ALC) were picked by the conference’s coach-es to finish fourth in the ALC behind No. 5 Northwestern, No. 17 Vanderbilt and No. 13 Penn State.
Each of those teams will lose key players to graduation in the offseason. Meanwhile, the only threat to Florida’s roster is poten-tial transfers or injuries.
“There’s so many positives that 
I wouldn’t see anyone who would 
really want to leave,” Cochran said. “Since our 
team’s so close, it’s hard to say. I can’t speak for every single person, but for the most part, 
everyone is having a great time and we all get along great.”
UF coach Amanda O’Leary 
said she isn’t thinking about how good the Gators might be in fu-ture seasons, and sophomore Car -
oline Chesterman couldn’t help but marvel at what they have ac-complished this year.
“Honestly, we’re all taken 
aback by the situation,” Ches-terman said. “We knew that we were going to be a good team, but I think we’re all kind of shocked that it happened so soon.”
Offensively, Florida has im-
proved almost across the board from a year ago, headlined by National Player of the Week and Tewaaraton Award nominee Kit-ty Cullen. 
The sophomore has more than 
doubled her 2010 goal total with an NCAA-leading 67 scores.
Even with the progress they have made after losing seven games in their inaugural season, the Gators still have a lot left to achieve in 2011.
They own the top seed and a 
first-round bye in the ALC Tour -
nament, which will be held from May 5-7 in Nashville, Tenn., and are a clear favorite to earn their first bid to the NCAA Tourna-ment.  
“I don’t think that we can even 
get lazy just because of all of the accomplishments we’ve had,” Cochran said. “They’re great ac-complishments and we’re thrilled about all of them, but everyone’s coming out to compete, so we still have to come out with that high-caliber level, too.”
With no seniors, Gators’ young squad looks to bright future THE PLATOON CENTER FIELDER MADE TWO STARTS DURING UF’S WEEKEND SERIES.
By JESSE SIMONTON
Alligator Staff Writer
jsimonton@alligator.org
Preston Tucker hinted last week that his teammate, 
Bryson Smith, could return from his suspension against 
Georgia. 
Turns out the right fielder doesn’t just hit home runs. 
He can predict the future. 
Smith, suspended since March 14 after he was arrested 
and charged for driving under the influence, returned to the field Saturday against the Bulldogs in Athens, Ga. 
The platoon center fielder started and was penciled 
into the two-hole by UF coach Kevin O’Sullivan. The se-nior nearly had a fairytale return, going 2 for 4 and knock-ing the go-ahead homer in the eighth before Florida’s bull-pen imploded in an eventual 7-2 loss. 
In No. 5 UF’s 14-7 win Sunday, Smith hit leadoff and 
started the Gators’ four-run first with a single to right. 
“He had a tremendous weekend,” Tucker said. “He’s a 
real good player, and we’re glad to have him out there.”
With Smith back, O’Sullivan now has added another 
right-handed-hitting outfielder to the mix, providing greater flexibility when fashioning lineups. Smith also 
brings an element of versatility, as he played 23 games at 
third base last season. 
Although the senior has yet to play the infield this 
year, he does present O’Sullivan with additional options after regular third baseman Zack Powers injured his knee Friday on a steal attempt.
Before his suspension, Smith started nine of Florida’s 
first 16 games — and appeared in all but two — batting .345 with five RBIs, including a game-winning pinch-hit single against Miami in UF’s 1-0 win on March 5. 
But more than his contributions on the field, Tucker 
said, Florida is glad to have one of its vocal leaders back. 
“He’s a motivator,” Tucker said. “He does a great job 
in the dugout keeping everyone positive.”Smith returns to field against Georgia after suspension

It all started when Terrell Wilks 
and his classmates went on a field 
trip.
The destination was the FBI 
building in New Haven, Conn.
“We were walking around the 
building, just looking,” Wilks said. 
“I was young, but there was some-
thing about the FBI that just stuck 
with me.”
Fast forward to another one of 
Wilks’ field trips.
This time, he was with Florida 
track and field coach Mike Hollo-
way and his teammates, who were 
celebrating their first NCAA Indoor Championship last summer.
On this occasion, Wilks was vis-
iting President Barack Obama at the White House in Washington, D.C.
During the trip, Wilks reconnect-
ed with Mike Coleman, a former ri-val runner from Ole Miss working 
with the Secret Service.
“I just paid a lot of attention to 
what was going on in D.C. with the Secret Service,” Wilks said. “I had 
dreams of being in the FBI anyway, so seeing the Secret Service and 
how they operate … it’s become my 
new interest after track and field is over for me.”After exchanging information 
with Coleman, Wilks seems well on his way to finding some good con-
nections in the industry.
“I think it excites him because 
it’ll be a big challenge for him,” said Bridget Draughn, his mother. “For 
me, if that’s what he wants to do, then I’m OK with it.
“It doesn’t matter to me what he 
does. As long as he’s staying posi-tive, that’s all I could ever ask for.”
While Wilks is excited about a 
potential career as a federal agent, he has other plans first.
With the second-best 60-meter 
dash time (6.59 seconds) and the seventh-best 100-meter dash mark 
(10.15 seconds) in school history, 
Wilks is hoping to turn his colle-giate success into a professional 
running contract and, hopefully, a 
shot at the 2012 Olympics.
“If you’re in this sport and you 
don’t want to go, there’s something wrong,” Wilks said. “I think the sky’s the limit for my potential, and 
I want to pursue track full-time.”
n n n
Wilks wasn’t always a sprinter.
In fact, he spent most of his time 
in high school playing basketball and football, winning two state championships on the hardwood and nearly attending Villanova as a defensive back.
But Wilks’ experience on the 
gridiron actually jumpstarted his foray into track.
During Wilks’ senior year at 
New Haven (Conn.) James Hill-house High, the football team’s 
speed coach, Gary Moore, was also 
the track coach. 
Moore recognized Wilks’ speed 
and insisted he run track, but Wilks remained reluctant.
“I just didn’t see the point of run-
ning around in a circle,” he said.
His senior year at Hillhouse saw 
him win state championships in 
the 55m dash, 100m dash and the 
outdoor 200m dash. As a result, he was named Connecticut’s Gatorade 
State Track and Field Athlete of the 
Year.
His impressive résumé, limited 
as it was, convinced Holloway to take a chance on the talented but inexperienced athlete.
Holloway was most impressed 
with Wilks’ speed, his height (6-foot-2) and his early success in a 
sport he was still learning.
“I asked coach Holloway when I 
came to be patient with me and for us to work together on everything,” 
Wilks said. “I told him that, as soon as he agreed to that, then I would 
have no problem coming here to 
work with him.”
In the end, taking a chance on 
track has paid great dividends for Wilks.
“He has grown tremendous-
ly,” Draughn said. “For him to go from Connecticut to Florida was a very large step for him, but he has 
adapted very well, and I’m pleased 
with him.”
n n n
Should Wilks attain his goal of 
protecting the leaders of the United States after he hangs up his spikes, it would be a fitting career for the 
sprinter.
While the Gators don’t officially 
name team captains, UF assistant director of communications Sean 
Cartell said Wilks’ role as Florida’s leader is “understood.”
Junior Christian Taylor said he 
appreciates how vocal Wilks is in practice and how his fellow 4x100 
relay running mate carries himself 
and steps up in tough situations.
“When you have your teammate 
says something to you, it’s a little different than when a coach does because he’s actually going through 
what you’re going through,” Taylor 
said. “It makes it a little more real, so you have that better connec-
tion.”
Holloway’s admiration for Wilks 
can be seen just from speaking to the coach. He speaks of the senior 
sprinter as more of a peer than an athlete under his tutelage.
“He’s helped solidify my belief 
that a coach and an athlete can be on the same page,” Holloway said. “And when Terrell and I are on the 
same page, things go very well.”
Wilks and Holloway’s ability to 
get on the same page has worked 
wonders for UF, earning the men’s 
squad two consecutive NCAA in-
door titles.
Florida is currently the top-
ranked team in the nation and is gunning to win its first-ever out-door national title. The Gators have 
come close the past two seasons, 
placing as the runner-up to Texas A&M both times by just three 
points combined.
“The past two years have sat on 
the wrong side of my stomach for a very long time,”  Wilks said.
Wilks described the last two 
national outdoor meets as “bit-tersweet” because he won indi-
vidual titles in the 4x100 relay, but the Gators still came up short as a 
team.
And as a leader, he willingly 
shoulders the blame for Florida not getting it done.
While Wilks qualified for the 
national outdoor meet in the 100m and 200m dashes, he failed to ad-
vance to the finals in both events, keeping him from scoring any team 
points from his efforts.
“To know that I didn’t make it 
and we lost by one point, it eats at me every day. … It’s not OK for me,” Wilks said. “I could’ve helped us do better, and I want to see us 
win.”
With a leader as motivated as 
Wilks, Florida may want to make 
some room for more championship 
hardware.
Ten victories at the Tom Jones 
Memorial Classic this past week-end against the likes of No. 2 Texas A&M and No. 10 Nebraska, includ-
ing a new personal-best for Wilks 
in the 200m dash (20.51 seconds), have the Gators thinking about a 
title sweep in 2011.
“He challenges me to challenge 
him, and I like that,” Holloway said. “He’s never a guy that walks 
out there and says, ‘I don’t want to do this today.’”
With all of the success Wilks 
has enjoyed in his career, another national championship seems like 
the only fitting end to his time in 
Gainesville.
“When I came, I wasn’t the lead-
er, and I had seen how the program was down,” Wilks said. “It was like, ‘Yeah, they’re Florida, so we’re 
paying some attention, but what 
are they really doing?’
“I’ve seen the program trans-
form, and I became a leader. I kind of just took it, and I guess every-body respects me. It’s great to see 
how it has all turned out.”18, ALLIGATOR n TUESDAY, APRIL 19, 2011

“I’m not drinking. We gotta kill 
45 minutes.” 
She says, “Let’s browse the 
books in Barnes and Noble.”
Then, she adds, “Hey, let’s see 
if we can find the reference the 
preacher told you about. They must sell Bibles.”   
“Yeah, why the hell not. Let’s see 
what that passage is all about. What was it again, Jeremiah, Chapter 1, verses 5-15?”
Inside, I say, “Find the section 
marked ‘Religion.’” 
Not one Bible.  Colleen says, “Over here’s a 
whole section of Bibles.”
I join her in the aisle, and I’m 
overwhelmed. Rows and rows of Jewish Bibles, Living Bibles, Good News Bibles, Bibles in German, French, Dutch, King James, Web-ster — Bibles everywhere. 
I say, “Any one.” From the 1,000 or so, I reach at 
random.
Looking down at about 3,000 
pages, I notice one dog-eared page. A cold chill runs up my spine, my heart races, my knees weaken, and I almost put the book back on the shelf.I turn to Colleen, “No f***ing 
way. If this dog-eared page is Jere-
miah Chapter 1:5, I swear to God.”
I open the book. I’m in disbelief.
Jeremiah 1:5. 
n n n  
The passage reads, “Before I 
formed thee in the belly, I knew thee, and before thou camest forth 
out of the womb ... I ordained thee 
a prophet.”
God commands Jeremiah to 
spread his message. Jeremiah’s a profligate, so he pleads mistaken identity. 
He tells God he’s not the right 
man for the job. But the Lord’s di-vine, unmerciful persistence insists. 
God says, “Behold, I have put 
my words in thy mouth.”  
The passage continues: Some-
times God chooses unlikely orators to deliver his message. God also warns Jeremiah he has no choice. If he doesn’t obey, he and his descen-dents will be punished severely.

 Like a carpenter’s callouses, my 
Irish Catholic mother’s skin shines between thumb and forefinger from her rosary beads. My father died of alcoholism; my brother died drunk 
in a fire. 
She’s a selfless woman who 
wore out her knees praying that 
her youngest son, all she had left, would see the light.
n n n  
While The Beatles blast from my 
car radio, I drive my mom to the store. 
Now 82, she asks, “Whatever 
happened to them, The Beatles?”
“Two of them are dead.” She says, “What a shame. Just 
when they were starting to be suc-cessful.”
She’s diagnosed with advanced 
Alzheimer’s. 
I need to get sober.  
n n n    
Six months later, I’m driving 
from Gainesville to a Miami nurs-ing home to visit my mom.
“I’m drinking too much. I have to 
stop.”
The sky opens, and sheets of 
rain force me off the turnpike. I squint through my wipers at a stop sign and see St. Jude’s church. It’s Sunday morning, and I laugh at the irony. 
St. Jude is the patron saint of lost 
causes. 
If ever there was a lost cause … 
Why not?
A solitary sheet of 8-by-10 paper 
shares the last pew with me. 
“Say this prayer to St. Jude sev-
en times a day for three weeks, and God will answer you.” 
Swayed by coincidence, I say the 
short prayer seven times and pray for God’s gift of sobriety. A selfish request, because if my mom needs me and I’m drunk, I won’t forgive myself. 
For three years, I recite the prayer 
everyday. I stay dry.   
n n n 
A year after my mom’s death, 
I’m done praying. I don’t need God anymore. 
I leave a Miami bar whacked. 
It’s 2 a.m. and, again, pouring rain. I squint through my wipers and see a truck paused at a stop sign. 
Not obliviously drunk, I slow up 
and pull behind the flatbed. I don’t see the 12-foot pipes that extend be-yond the back of the truck. The steel explodes through the windshield, rockets past both my ears and out the back window.    
I sit frozen. The silence be-
comes palpable and merciless in its depths. 
The only sound comes from my 
car’s radio. The Temptations tow me to clarity, then tears.  
“People get ready, there’s a train 
a coming. You don’t need no ticket, you just get on board.”
On Sept. 10, 2001, covered in bro-
ken glass, decapitation two inches from both ears, I realize there are no lost causes. 
I answer my mother’s prayers. 
Finally, I climb on board. 
The very next day, two planes 
destroy a skyscraper in New York. Entombed amid the steel and con-
crete of 9/11 are three captains: 
three study mates who passed a test I failed.  
People often ask me, “How 
long has it been since you’ve had a drink?”  
The date is painful, but easy to 
remember.

    Anything to relieve stress: It’s scotch 
and smokes one night, the gym the next.     
  A black giant interrupts my workout.  “Someone’s praying for you very, very 
hard.” 
  Not this shit again — not now. My life’s 
too complicated for a late entry.  
  I’m entrenched in a restaurant that’s sink-
ing fast. I owe more than $100,000 to local contractors, and thanks to an arrogant part-ner who ﬂ  ed, business sucks. Every phone call’s a creditor.
  I’m drinking, drugging, whoring, gam-
bling, juggling two girlfriends and studying for captain with three other lieutenants.
  I’m so busy I barely have time to ignore 
my creditors.
  The giant says, “The Holy Spirit compels 
me to talk to you. Someone’s praying for you very, very hard.”
  I stare at my sneakers, “The same line 
again. The same f***ing line.”  
  Elijah’s voice slashes again, “You spent a 
year in Vietnam, and your brother died in a ﬁ  re.” 
  I don’t need this crap now, but the giant’s 
glare reﬂ  ects my empty future. He’s on a mis-sion. 
He recites my life the way actors read 
scripts.      Then, Elijah tells his story.  “I played football at Grambling Univer-
sity. I was good enough to be a pro. Football was all I thought about. My ﬁ  ancé suggested I spend less time in a three-point stance and 
more time on my knees.
  “She said, ‘Be thankful for the gifts that 
God gave you. Don’t pray for more. If it’s 
God’s will, your dreams will come true.’”
  Then, his kicker.  “During my senior year, I was diagnosed 
with bone cancer. The doctors said lose the leg or lose your life. A week before the op-eration, like Christ in Gethsemane, I sweated 
blood. I vowed to God if he saved my leg, I’d 
devote my life him.” 
  The giant’s intensity mesmerizes me.   “The night before the operation, all signs 
of cancer disappeared. My doctors were mys-tiﬁ  ed — not a trace.”
  Then, Elijah talks casually about things I 
barely remember. He preaches a long time. 
  I squirm and sneak peeks at the two frozen 
hands on the clock. 
  Silent, Elijah looks skyward searching for 
divine disclosure. He praises God, thanks God and prays. 
Then, he stops. A calm descends, and in a hushed tone, 
he delivers the ﬁ  nal blow — Elijah reminisces about my future.   “God gave you a 
gift. He gave you the ability to communi-cate with people, and you used it in an un-
holy way. God’s dis-
appointed in you. I am your last warning. Why do you ignore my Lord?”
  I hear my skin 
crawl.  
  Once more, Elijah glances upward and 
praises Jesus.
  “Yes, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. The Holy 
Spirit wants you to read the Bible. Jeremiah, Chapter 1, verses 5-15.”
  “The Bible?”    “Jeremiah, Chapter 1, verses 5-15. No more 
self-gratiﬁ  cation. Fulﬁ  ll the plans he made for you before you were born — yes, Jesus; praise Jesus.”
  I’m scared shitless. Got to end this. 
“Thanks, man.” 
  “Don’t thank me. I’m only his messen-

    My girlfriend Colleen’s a brilliant girl with 
the balls of a burglar. Nothing shakes her, yet she’s alarmed.  
  “You can’t ignore this. God’s trying to 
reach you. You know how strong your moth-er’s prayers are.” 
I reply,   “Calm down. I’ll look into it when 
I get around to it.”

    Two days later, “Colleen, I have a doctor’s 
appointment in the city. You want to have dinner afterward?”
  After we eat, rush hour approaches.   Rather than trek upstate, “What do you

comes back empty-handed.
  “No more papers.”   “No papers in Manhattan?” 
  Then, a candy store two minutes later, “No 
papers. He’s all out.” 
  I say, “That’s crazy. Let’s get the hell out 
of Manhattan. We’ll just catch a movie up 
north.” 
  In Yonkers, I see a multiplex and pull over. 
I buy tickets for the 8 p.m. show.
