A Gainesville Regional Airport survey 
that gauges residents’ interests in nonstop 
ﬂ  ights to New York City may result in more convenient travel to the Big Apple in the future.
The online survey, which opened 
Monday, had garnered about 500 responses as of Wednesday, said Laura Aguiar, an airport spokeswoman.
New York City’s LaGaurdia Airport is the No. 2 destination leaving Gainesville, she said, topped by Miami and followed by Atlanta and Boston.
“New York has always been a very 
strong area for us, I think because of our technology-based businesses and other business travel,” she said. “It’s interesting to note that LaGaurdia is so popular, and it’s not even a direct route.”
Aguiar said she’s conﬁ  dent Gainesville 
has enough passengers to ﬁ  ll direct ﬂ  ights to New York City.
The challenge, she said, is to show airline operators that offering direct ﬂ  ights would be proﬁ  table.
She said the survey’s purpose is to 
conﬁ  rm that Gainesville travelers could ﬁ  ll up the ﬂ  ights, if offered.
“We do think it’s viable, and we just 
need to be able to convince the airlines that this is a viable route for nonstop service,” she said.
The survey includes 11 multiple-choice 
and three free-response questions that ask people if they would take a ﬂ  ight to the New York City area, how often they would take the ﬂ  ight and what ﬂ  ight times would be most convenient.
The survey will be open for at least 
another week, Aguiar said.
If an airline that already services 
Gainesville begins to offer a direct New York City route, Aguiar said, it will not

University Police ﬁ  led a sworn 
complaint Tuesday afternoon 
charging a UF student and his girlfriend for allegedly staging an armed robbery at an on-campus convenience store in December.
The sworn complaint charged 
Steven P . Klepac, a 20-year-old UF horticulture junior, with ﬁ  l-ing a false police report, misuse of the 911 system and theft. The complaint also charged Klepac’s girlfriend, Lani Caraballo, 21, with ﬁ  ling a false police report and theft as an accomplice, said UPD Spokesman Maj. Brad Barber.
Klepac originally told police he 
was robbed at knifepoint at about 4 a.m. Dec. 9 in the Graham Oasis convenience store, Barber said.
A UF Alert was sent out at 4:19 
a.m., informing students, staff and faculty that a suspect, described as a white male with a khaki-colored jacket and gray sweatpants, had robbed the convenience store. 
However, during the investiga-
tion, detectives confronted Klepac about inconsistencies they found in his story.Klepac con-
fessed that the robbery was planned, Barber said. He told police that the robber was ac-tually his girl-friend wearing a 
disguise.
Barber said the complaint will 
be reviewed by the State Attor-ney’s Ofﬁ  ce.
Klepac said in an interview Wednesday that the charges were dropped as part of a plea agree-ment for a previous arrest, but his lawyer, Stephen Bernstein, could not be reached Wednesday eve-ning to conﬁ  rm.
“This is a very serious inci-
dent that required a tremendous amount of investigative resources to resolve and, regrettably, por-trayed a dangerous incident that did not in fact occur,” Barber said.

Student Government politi-
cal parties can now campaign 
30 days before an election.
The UF Supreme Court 
unanimously struck down the seven-day “campaigning” re-striction Wednesday in a hear-ing to determine the constitu-tionality of the election codes.
The court ruled that the 
deﬁ  nitions of “campaigning” and “campaign activity” were too ambiguous and identical in wording.
“We are resolving the am-
biguities of the law in a way that embraces the most lenient standard possible,” said Chief Justice Matt Michel during the hearing.
Students Party counsel Vic-
tor Olivieri argued that the time frames of the election codes were unlawful and restricted free speech. He said the Swamp Party and its presidential candi-date, Christina Bonarrigo, were in violation of the seven-day campaigning period when she announced her candidacy on Turlington Plaza Jan. 24.
The Students Party cited 
ﬁ  ve complaints to the Supreme Court. Friday , the court heard the ﬁ  rst, which requested a cease and desist against Bonar-rigo. The court ruled against the Students Party.

Sara Kaner knows what it’s like to 
struggle with her weight.
“I never weighed myself,” Kaner 
said. “I didn’t want to know.”
The 21-year-old UF public rela-
tions senior played two sports in high 
school in addition to constant work-outs. Her mother even cooked for her.
When she came to college and had 
to schedule her own workouts and eat on a meal plan, her weight gradually increased.
A new program is starting to help 
students like Kaner. Kristen Medina, a doctoral student in clinical and health psychology, has started a new weight gain prevention program in the UF Weight Management Lab as her dis-sertation.
She said the program’s purpose is 
to help students develop better eating and exercising habits. She got the idea when one of the girls in the Weight Management Lab did a similar study.
Medina will find about 150 under -
graduate freshmen, sophomores and juniors to participate in the program. The free program will last about 10 weeks, but participants must be full-time students.She is also trying to recruit about 
10 research assistants trained in weight management to help her with the program.
The program already has some stu-
dent responses.
“Every research project has its own 
challenges,” Medina said. “We will just wait and see.”
Medina has worked on similar 
projects with adults in rural commu-nities, which the lab mainly focuses on. She said she is trying to tailor this new program to college students.
“We’re trying to make it applicable 
to their lifestyle,” she said.
Dorothy Berry, a 20-year-old UF 
zoology sophomore, said she didn’t gain weight when she got to college — she lost it.
Despite that, Berry said she knows 
several people who gained a signifi-cant amount of weight. She thinks the program is a great idea.
Berry said she believes a lot of peo-
ple rely on their parents for nutrition-al value. When people come to college and have so many unhealthy options, it’s easy to gain weight, she said.
Or, as 19-year-old Zachary Sorren-
tino said, “It’s definitely the beer.”
The UF physics sophomore said his 
roommates drink alcohol frequently, 
and the calorie count adds up.
He said the program is an interest-
ing idea, but he doesn’t know how it will get students to exercise besides running and biking.New program to help

A plane takes off from Gainesville Regional Airport on Wednesday afternoon. An online survey created 
by the airport asked residents about their interest in nonstop flights to New York City.
The direct flight would bring more patrons to the airport
cost the airport money.
However, if the route is added, 
it would bring more patrons, 
which could clog the usually full waiting and dining areas and restrooms, she said.
She said the airport is 
conducting a study this year to explore expansion of the terminal to accommodate higher foot traffic.
“Our traffic numbers are up. 
Our terminal is full. So now, our focus really becomes on adding a destination,” she said. “Maybe not a new airline, but a service.”
Kelsey Reese, a 21-year-old UF 
marketing senior and UF Career Resource Center intern, said nonstop flights to New York City could open up better avenues for both job-seeking students and out-of-state employers who seek new hires.
“It makes it easier for the employers to visit Gainesville and talk to students about internships,” she said, “and it gives students more opportunity to get internships that aren’t in Gainesville.”
Nicole Larson, a 24-year-old 
UF agricultural education and communication senior, said she has flown to New York City three times since she’s been at UF.
She said she went to tour and 
job hunt.
But because Gainesville didn’t 
offer direct flights, she drove two hours south to catch a nonstop flight out of Orlando.
Larson said nonstop flights 
are more feasible for students and minimize the risk of lost baggage.
“As a student, I would prefer 
a flight out of Gainesville,” she said. “For me, it’s that sense of convenience.”

The Boy Scouts of America’s National 
Executive Board decided Wednesday morn-
ing to postpone until May its decision about changing its policy on allowing gay mem-bers into scout troops nationwide.
The Boy Scouts’ policy doesn’t allow gay 
members and leaders into the organization.
The proposed change would leave the 
decision to individual troop charter holders about whether to accept gay members and leaders into their troops.
“In the past two weeks, Scouting has 
received an outpouring of feedback from the American public,” said BSA national spokesman Deron Smith in a statement. “It reinforces how deeply people care about Scouting and how passionate they are about the organization.”
Eagle Scout Justin Bickford, board mem-
ber and communications director for Scouts for Equality, said the change would be a step in the right direction.
“Long term, I truly believe it will have a 
positive effect,” he said. “Short term, a lot of people are going to be upset they have to make the decision themselves.”
In 2000, the organization won a case in the 
U.S. Supreme Court that allowed discrimi-nation of sexuality if it is expressed as the organization’s public or private viewpoint.
In July, the organization reaffirmed its 
ban on gay members and has since faced na-tional backlash. Sponsors, including United Way, UPS and Intel, have pulled funding.
About 2.7 million boys participate in 
BSA.
Of the more than 100,000 scouting units 
owned and operated by chartered organiza-tions, nearly 70 percent do so through a reli-gious organization’s charter.
Educational organizations support about 
8 percent, partly as a result of the Scouts’ discriminatory policy, said Joseph Jackson, a UF professor of legal skills and a former Scout.
Jackson said he believes that social at-
titudes have become more accepting and tolerant of people with different sexual ori-entations.
“I would foresee there would be greater 
pressure to enact a more equal national pol-icy down the road,” he said.
Austin Reed, a 20-year-old UF biochem-
istry junior, became an Eagle Scout in 2006.
He said he believes that Boy Scouts 
should be open to all males, regardless of their sexual orientation.
“I believe it’s not our place, or the Boy 
Scouts’ place, to discriminate against any-body because it is an all-male group or anything,” he said. “Whatever decision is reached, the result is going to be a lot of peo-ple with lots of feeling and emotion about whether it is the right one.”

57 TOTAL VOTESPoint ﬁ  ngers at Go Daddy, not Beyoncé
According to one self-proclaimed spokeswoman for 
the mothers of America, Beyoncé is an imminent threat to female empowerment.
According to her post “Watching Beyoncé’s halftime show 
with kids raised eyebrows, questions,” Rachel Campos-Duffy , “Today Moms” blogger and former “The Real World” cast member, observed her children’s bewildered reactions to the Super Bowl halftime show and, rather than change the channel and ignore her kids’ questions like a normal adult, tried to make it a “teachable moment.”
“I nonchalantly said, ‘This isn’t very pretty or empower-
ing. Too bad she’s wasting her talent.’ My 8 year old declared, ‘She looks weird.’ Indeed.”
Campos-Duffy said she then tweeted the following: 
“Tired of NFL & Obamas holding Beyonce up as role model 4 girls. Totally slutty halftime show. Thanks for ‘empower-ing’ our girls!” Campos-Duffy maintained that other Twitter moms echoed her concerns with the halftime show and that she is “not a prude.”
I have many issues with Campos-Duffy’s pearl-clutching 
criticisms, and not just that her only supporting quote is from her 8-year-old son (who is learning at an early age that it’s OK to mock women’s appearances if you don’t agree with their artistic choices).
My most pressing issue, however, is how this “concerned 
mother” so easily tears down Beyoncé’s indisputably pow-erful performance in fewer than 140 characters, yet didn’t mention the endless spew of Go Daddy commercials, which viewers have suffered through for years.
I don’t know what kind of moron is offended by Beyon-
cé’s muscular thighs but not 10-second bites of soft-core porn during every other commercial break.
How misguided can you be to let your kids watch a mod-
el play tonsil hockey with a pockmarked “nerd” and say nothing, but the second a wildly talented, successful female artist dares to wear a jumpsuit, your ﬁ  ngers get busy telling everyone how “slutty” she is?   
Beyoncé has sold 75 million records and won 16 Gram-
mys. Her thighs could crush a grown man’s head. She is at the helm of her own empire, and she could “do what I want” since she was 30, she told GQ in a recent interview. Her manic-per-fectionist discipline with her ca-reer is nothing short of admirable. So why is she being reduced to a “slutty halftime show” by every mommy with a superiority com-plex and a Twitter?
Such is the nature of our 
“raunch culture,” deﬁ  ned by New 
York Magazine writer Ariel Levy in her book “Female Chau-vinist Pigs,” about the rise of modern media’s cartoonish portrait of female sexuality and the men and women who both pretend to ﬁ  ght and contribute to it.
“Female chauvinist pigs don’t bother to question the crite-
ria on which women are judged,” Levy writes. “They are too busy judging other women themselves.”
Female chauvinist pigs, women like Campos-Duffy who 
use their inﬂ  uence as “concerned mothers,” are not actually ﬁ  ghting for a “family-friendly” halftime show.
They’re contributing to a culture that viliﬁ  es women for 
being in command of their sexuality while ignoring the larg-er, tougher issue of men commanding women’s sexuality.
Beyoncé deﬁ  es the raunch-culture model of female sex-
uality. There’s nothing cartoonish or contrived about her. After reading every magazine article and watching every TV feature, one can rest assured that the Beyoncé on stage at the halftime show Sunday was 100 percent Sasha Fierce. Unlike the Go Daddy commercials, there is no man in the background pulling the strings to sell a product. I will make a bold claim and say that, in the modern music industry, Be-yoncé is the highest authority on female empowerment.
Perhaps I am, after all this, not qualiﬁ  ed to pass advice 
onto a parent.
However, if you want to seriously educate your children 
on female empowerment, don’t persecute successful women who happen to use sex as art. Persecute those who use false ideals of female sexuality to sell technology services.

Six days a week, 
uh oh
“The U.S. Postal Service took another major step in its battle for ﬁ  scal viability Wednesday, announcing plans to halt Sat-urday delivery of ﬁ  rst-class mail,” according to an article in 
USA Today.
This is terrible news. There are only so many days in the 
week on which our mail system can bail.
Postmaster General Patrick Donahoe said the service reduc-
tion is expected to save $2 billion annually, according to the ar-ticle.
We suppose the USPS is running out of ways to make money , 
right? We’re all using email so much that we only use the USPS to ship big packages; we haven’t invented that technology yet.
“It’s irresponsible for us not to pursue this course,” he said 
at an announcement at postal service headquarters in L’Enfant Plaza, according to a Washington Post article. “It’s too big of a cost savings to ignore.”
We should try to keep the USPS around for as long as possi-
ble. It’s a part of our society’s infrastructure that keeps life mov-ing forward at a responsible pace. Without it, society might col-lapse. No mail system? No more roads. No more tolls. No more milk bottles delivered to our front doors. No more free Wi-Fi in fast food restaurants. No more email. See where we’re going with this? Good thing another postal service is coming back to help us through these trying times.
“The Postal Service, the synth-pop duo of Ben Gibbard and 
Jimmy Tamborello, is reuniting for the 10th anniversary of its only album, 2003’s ‘Give Up,’” according to an article on Bill-board’s website.
That’s right, folks. Your favorite indie band from high school 
is making a comeback. Just like Destiny’s Child, Justin Timber-lake and the Spice Girls.
It’s our time, guys. This is ﬁ  nally the time for the millennial 
generation to be happy . Lord knows we haven’t been happy in quite a while. 
Maybe getting rid of a day of mail delivery and pickup won’t 
be so bad after all. Our favorite things are all reuniting to cheer us up! All we need now are some DunkAroos and some clear Pepsi to keep us going until everyone who should be reunited is, in fact, reunited.
According to an article in October’s “Spinner,” Ben Gibbard 
promised there wouldn’t be a new Postal Service record.
“There are no plans to make a second record,” Gibbard told 
Spinner. “I can’t say that enough.”
The band is planning to release only a deluxe record of its 
ﬁ  rst album — not a whole new one. But the release of the record is deﬁ  nitely tied with new performances, as the band will play at Coachella.
We need this, guys. Think of the USPS workers. They need 
this, too. Just imagine them listening to “Such Great Heights” when they’re packing up to head home Friday evening, but the poppier version, not the one covered by Iron & Wine.
Keep your spirits up, USPS! Maybe all six days of your ser-
vice will eventually be reunited. You might have to wait a whole decade, though.

Greyhounds will stride along-
side models, but not because of 
their long legs and slim build.
The models will carry rabbits 
in pretty totes, but not because they’re cute and petite.
It’s all to find the animals a new 
home.
The third annual Runways and 
Rescues fashion show, created by Jacquelyn Brooks of Jacquelyn Brooks Designs, will incorporate adoptable animals with fashion to promote the animal rescues and two fashion lines.
This semiformal, pink-carpet 
event will be from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. Sunday at Haile Plantation Coun-try Club, 9905 SW 44th Ave. 
Participants can sip cham-
pagne, take photographs in front of Hollywood-inspired backdrops, chow down on a dinner at the clubhouse and watch the models glide down the runway in smoky lavender, chartreuse, floral and ‘60s-inspired attire.
“I thought it’d be nice to have something a little more upscale for pets,” Brooks said. “A lot of formal charity events are health-related.”
All ticket sales and event pro-
ceeds benefit Gold Coast Grey-hound Adoptions and Gainesville Rabbit Rescue, which are provid-ing the animals.
“We’re completely honored 
that Jacquelyn picked us,” said Ann-Marie Brown, adoption co-
ordinator of Gold Coast Greyhound Adoptions. “We don’t get a tre-mendous amount of publicity.”
There will 
be six to eight 
adoptable greyhounds and several rabbits in the show. All except one animal that participated in last year’s show were adopted.
“It’s going to be really hard to 
get through this event without adopting one,” said Brooks, who owns a dog, JoJo, and two cats, Maverick and Tucker.
Heather Jones, a model in last 
year’s show, said she struggles with the same thing.
“I just wanted to adopt all of 
the dogs,” said the 28-year-old who will model in the show again this year. She also owns a minia-ture poodle named Benjamin. “I was in heaven.”
The models will meet the ani-
mals Saturday to get acquainted with them before the show. Jones said she is excited to work with greyhounds for the first time.
“They don’t have the ‘pup-
pyhood’ that normal dogs have. They’re treated like professional athletes,” Brown said. “It’s neat because they’re getting new pup-py experiences. And it’s going to be really neat to see all the fashion that Jacquelyn put together.”
Both organizations will set up 
booths for people interested in adopting the soon-to-be glamor -
ized animals.
“I always love seeing the ani-
mals,” Brooks said. “It’s a lot like planning a wedding — kind of stressful, but it’s a lot of fun.”
Online sales ended Monday, 
but general admission tickets can be purchased at the door for $45.

If you lived through what we music aficionados call the 
“emo movement” from 2005-2006, you’d know that the re-emergence of era leaders Fall Out Boy last week caused an interweb riot, to say the least.
But before you rummage through your closet for your Hot 
Topic skinnys, let’s think this over. 
Sure, Fall Out Boy has made some great music that got us 
through the awkward middle school years. 
However, will this type of music be able to withstand to-
day’s music industry that has not only moved onto more elec-
tronic-fueled sales, but generally seems to hold artist comebacks at an arm’s length?
The Pros: New StuffThe new material (which was an-
nounced Monday) is good — seriously. If you’re a FOB fan, this is what you’ve been waiting to hear. 
The first single “My Songs Know What 
You Did In The Dark (Light ‘Em Up)” is 
just as catchy as their old stuff. Plus it’s complete with a vid-eo featuring 2 Chainz.
 The Boys are up to their old tricks, mixing their fast-paced 
pop-rock with visible nods to their supposed street cred in the biz.
Along with the single, the band announced a new record, 
“Save Rock and Roll,” and a coinciding summer tour. 
Die-hard fans who have waited for fresh tracks shouldn’t 
be disappointed — this is exactly what the band did three years ago.
The Cons: “New Stuff”All of these announcements — which bassist Pete Wentz 
had been adamantly denying in the press up until the release date — should be taken with caution.
There’s no telling how well the new material will be em-
braced by the industry. As much as we might not want to admit it, that’s just how it works. 
Today’s music business seems to be dominated by electro-
pop fusion artists. It’s a trend, just like emo rock was in the mid-2000s.
What makes this all tricky for FOB is how the band will 
maneuver the new trends. Lots of artists trying to make comebacks are falling flat with very few exceptions.
I’m not saying Fall Out Boy won’t be successful, but in a 
few short years, the industry has changed. It needs to figure out a way to make its old sounds new again.Fall Out Boy Wentz, 
now it’s backz: Why you should (and shouldn’t) care

Sweat covers your entire body — 
so much so, that drops have begun 
to accumulate on your arms and are beginning to creep down toward your fingertips.  They splash onto the dirt.  
Every joint, every muscle, every 
inch of your body has screamed out at some point — sometimes all at once — begging you to stop and take a break, and  just sit down and rest awhile.
Bedtime consists of sleeping bags 
and inch-thick mats in wooden shel-ters, which are riddled with mouse droppings. You lie awake, unable to sleep because the pain makes get-ting comfortable impossible.
Welcome to your life for the next 
six months, thru-hiker.
The Appalachian Trail is not for 
the faint-of-heart, -mind or -body . It is 2,000-plus miles of rugged trail in the heart of dense foliage. It is known by many as the green tunnel.
It is the biggest adventure of your 
life. You are on a pilgrimage. You are walking where thousands of others have walked, but it is a journey all your own.
You will cry, you will scream and 
you will laugh. But not once will you regret your decision to walk.
I had the pleasure of backpack-
ing about 500 miles this summer. It was the best decision I have ever made. Through the rain and the pain, I found in myself a love for nature and backpacking that I never knew existed.
A stranger invited me into the 
great unknown. After a month get-ting to know each other, we set off with 65 pounds on our backs and no experience.
Our first day consisted of a whop-ping four miles on the approach trail. And boy, did we feel accom-plished. We slept in a small clearing on top of Frosty Mountain, not even making it to Springer Mountain, the actual start of the trail.
Within the first week, my legs 
were covered in bug bites, and my nails were laden with dirt. My trail name was “Bellows,” as I was suc-cessful at bringing fire to life.  We’d sent home boxes of things we real-ized we would never use, lightening our load tremendously.
Our first official trail town was 
Hiawassee, Ga. We successfully hitchhiked into town and received the most ridiculous trail magic any backpacker could hope for: a roof over our heads, a barbecue salmon dinner, a boat ride on a lake, the house to ourselves and the keys to a car — all from complete strangers. 
The mountains are full of magic.We embarked on our first night-
hike as we departed from the Great Smoky Mountains. We found our -
selves hiking not only in the wee hours of the morning but also through a lightning storm. 
Steam fogged up our headlamps, 
and weariness had set in miles ear -
lier.  After a 23.4-mile day , we found ourselves setting up camp in the rain at 1 a.m. with-out any dinner. Sleep was trying to set in, only to be 
eluded by a 
bear crashing down the moun-tain and finding itself outside our tent — Nothing some heavy hand clapping couldn’t handle.
We slept next to, beneath and 
even inside fire towers and were able to look out onto the Appala-chians and see the mountains from where we had come. On one such tower, we were so high up, a pro-peller plane flew below us. We had a sense of accomplishment in that moment.
We stopped at ponds and caught 
fish with poles made from sticks, us-ing flower petals as makeshift lures. 
We whitewater rafted on the 
Nantahala River and dove into the 
icy water below. I lost my sunglasses when my trail part-ner pushed me out of our raft. 
We fought rattle-
snakes that blocked our paths. We made fires and read by the 
light of the flickering flames.
We lived without a care. Time 
wasn’t important. Mileage wasn’t an issue. We were simply living for the moment and embracing every second of it.
Every mile was filled with emo-
tion. Every step was filled with ac-complishment. Every day we be-came more human and less affected by the pains of modern life. Every day we got closer to living, and we will never be the same.
Getting off-trail was one of the 
hardest things I’ve had to do. The woods had become my home. The ground was a welcome bed and the moonlight was my night light. Our last day was unexpected. My new reality ended and it hit me like a ton of bricks.
I slept on the floor of my room 
for days, not used to the softness of a bed.  I craved cold mountain wa-ter and its crisp, pure taste. I had to sleep with a pillow over my eyes, as nothing is quite like the darkness of the woods. 
And I cried. I cried for the woods 
I had left behind, for the simplicity I knew was now over, and for an experience I knew would one day seem merely like a dream.
Getting back into the swing of 
things happened quickly. Social me-dia has a way of pulling you in, even if you don’t want it to. It has helped me keep in touch with trail friends and share photos of memories now long over. But the trail is ever-pres-ent and continually calling me back. It is a place, it is a love, it is a pas-sion, it is a hurdle and it is a home to which you can always return.
Sometimes while walking on the 
Plaza of the Americas or moseying around Turlington, I’ll close my eyes, and for a second, I’m back in the woods. 
I’m surrounded by the sounds 
and smells of the trail. I’m sweating and exhausted. My heart is pound-ing and my breathing is heavy . But I’m focused, and I am calm because I’m where I’m supposed to be. I’m, once again, deep inside the heart of the green tunnel. 
My walk in the woods

Mountains National Park during the summer months.
What Not To Pack
When hiking on the trail, it can 
be difficult to know what types 
of situations you’ll encounter. 
To avoid having to send home 
belongings on your journey, fol-
low this list of what not to bring 
(Remember, you’re trying to stay 
as lightweight as possible):
• Cotton clothes or jeans
• A lantern • More food than you could need• A shovel, for your bathroom   breaks
• Jewelry• Sunblock• An axe or hatchet — just no. • A towel• Excessive toiletries• Solar panel charger• Anything that starts with “but   what if ...”You are walking 
where thousands of 
others have walked, 
but it is a journey 
all your own.Elise Giordano / Alligator StaffTHURSDAY, FEBRUARY 7, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 9

Fangirls everywhere can finish 
crying a river. Justin Timberlake is 
back.
Timberlake dropped his first 
solo single, “Suit & Tie,” in almost seven years this month. This new tune is part of JT’s upcoming al-bum, “The 20/20 Experience,” which is set to drop March 19, ac-cording to Billboard.com.
But, of course, JT could never drop an album and just let it be. This project also involves a style collaboration with suit designer Tom Ford. After all, his single is all about, well, being clad in a suit and tie.
Timberlake wore the designer 
head-to-toe at the SAG Awards and a custom-designed suit at his wedding to Jessica Biel in October. The artwork for the single features a Tom Ford tuxedo, shirt and satin bow tie.
As part of his grand re-en-trance into mu-sic, Timberlake will perform at the Grammy Awards Sun-day. Chances are he will per -
form his new single while wearing a suit 
and tie. But the thing is, I don’t think this song is Grammy-wor -
thy. I love JT and his many talents, but his time in music is up.The song has a very odd intro, 
and the rest of the song hurts to listen to. It is overly auto-tuned, monotonous and outright bad. He’s trying way too hard, and it shows.
The lyrics are simple and don’t 
mean much. Jay-Z is a rap god, and even he couldn’t save this song from being terrible.
All these big announcements 
and moves make me think he knew how awful this song was, and he needed to distract his fans.Poor Timberlake. He is like 
the Will Schuester of the music industry — a man in his 30s still trying to make it big and perform on stage. Just like Mr. Schue needs to give up the awkward solos and dance pieces he does in “Glee,” JT should move past the music in-dustry.
JT is a great actor and business-
man, but I’m doubtful music is still his thing.  He already brought sexy back in 2006, but only time will tell if he can do it again.

A salad a day keeps heart dis-
ease away.
V egetarians are 32 percent less 
likely to be hospitalized or die from 
heart disease than nonvegetarians, according to a recent study pub-lished in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.
Researchers at the University 
of Oxford in England  found that the lower risk of heart disease for vegetarians is likely due to their lower cholesterol and blood pres-sure levels compared to meat and fish eaters.
The study followed 44,561 par -
ticipants, 34 percent of whom have been vegetarian for more than 10 years.
Mitchell Knutson, a UF associate 
professor of nutritional biochemis-try and 30-year vegetarian, said he wasn’t surprised by the results.
“Being a vegetarian will de-
crease your risk of many diseases: heart disease, cancer, obesity ,” he said.
Jerry MacDougall, manager and 
owner of Harvest Health & Whole Foods in Alachua, said he’s been a vegetarian since 1972.
He said eating 
a meatless diet helps cut down on cholesterol and fat intake. “A lot of the clog-ging of the arter -
ies comes from 
meat-based proteins,” he said.
Patty Alvarenga, a 20-year-old 
UF marketing sophomore, said she became a vegetarian in 2012 after she became concerned with her family history of high cholesterol.
“I have high cholesterol and de-
cided to first cut out red meat from my diet and then, everything else just followed,” she said. “I know that I’m contributing to my future health.”
While vegetarians can rejoice 
at the study’s findings, some meat eaters aren’t convinced.Although Lindsay Patenaude, 
a 20-year-old UF psychology and business administration junior, knows that heart disease is a seri-ous matter, she said she wouldn’t give up meat.
“There’s other ways to combat 
heart disease,” she said. “I can ex-ercise to keep my heart healthy. ”
While some students can’t cut 
the carnivorous habit, Gainesville food shops such as  Reggae Shack Cafe, The Top and Civilization sup-port the lifestyle by highlighting meat-free options on their menus.
UF was also named the second-
most vegan-friendly large universi-ty by PETA’s Most V egan-Friendly college contest in 2011, according to Alligator archives.
Karma Cream, an organic ice 
cream cafe, 1025 W University Ave., labels items in the food shop that are vegetarian- and vegan-friendly to help customers with di-etary restrictions. “Pretty much ev-ery restaurant has a lot of options,” said Kyle Fick, co-owner of Karma Cream. “It’s all about choices.”

� CBS CONFIRMED A FINAL 
SEASON JAN. 30.

Throughout the past eight 
years, “How I Met Your Moth-
er” fans have attempted to un-cover the identity of Ted Mos-by’s baby-mama to no avail. 
Luckily, television’s best-
kept secret may be unveiled in the show’s final season.
In fall, rumors began to cir-
culate that this season would be Jason Segel’s last, which left the fate of the show in question.
Segel’s representatives 
promptly replied by saying the rumors were misconstrued and “lost in translation” during an interview with an Austrian website.
Last week, Nina Tassler, 
president of CBS Entertainment, confirmed Jason Segel and the rest of the cast would return for a ninth and final season.
Tassler admitted her excite-
ment for “this amazing cast to tell the final chapter and reveal television’s most mysterious 
mother to some of TV’s most pas-s i o n a t e fans.”
But that’s 
not the only secret to be r e v e a l e d 
next year.
“I’m excited to see how the 
writers tie up the story lines,” said Grace Kranstover, a 19-year-old UF political science sophomore, “like if Marshall ends up as a judge, if Lily takes up art again, and what ends up of Barney and Robin since I sus-pect their wedding will be this season’s finale.”Final season may 
reveal how Ted met their mother

Dear Friend,
Communicate by saying the magical 
words, “I want to have sex.” The guy you’ve been seeing has been on board with this idea since he learned what the real use for socks and banana peels are. You do not need to worry about scaring him off with your outrageous demand.Dear Mediocre Advice,
I’ve been dating this guy for about a month, but all we do is make out. How do I let him know I want to take things to the next level without being 
too aggressive? Dear Friend,
Many have decided Valentine’s Day is a curse on humanity. So, you may not get the teddy bear you dread so much. I have an idea that will be a gift for both of you. Tell him not to get you anything. He won’t have to stroll the aisles of CVS looking for what he thinks summarizes your relationship. Whatever you get, you’re going to overanalyze anyway. You’ll somehow fig-ure that if he gets you a dancing tiger that lights up and sings, “Hero,” by Enrique Iglesias, then he’s crazy about you. But if he gets you a box of chocolates that look thoughtless, you’ll think he doesn’t care about you. All you need are rose petals to throw on a mattress. It’s cheap and will fulfill your exercise needs for the week. Make love, not accusations about the 
future of your relationship.Dear Mediocre Advice,
How do I hint to my boyfriend that I don’t want a tacky ted-dy bear for Valentine’s Day without sounding like a b---h?
Dear not-my-friend,
I think you meant “realistic” when you said “unadventurous.” I’m not sure about the best places to bang on campus, but I can definitely tell you the worst places: on the blanket where the people at Krishna lunch sing, any bike lane, a live lecture recording, next to the guy on Turlington who yells at the sinners and holds the “JESUS SAVES” sign, with anyone who is trying to hand you a pamphlet, and — if it’s same-sex 
intercourse — in the Hub at Chick-fil-A. Dear Mediocre Advice,
I know you are unadventurous when it comes to threesomes, but what do you think are the best places to 
bang on campus?

When 19-year-old Nicola Gregory visited 
Fit2Run for the first time, she was already 
prepared for her exercise film debut. The store tapes its customers running to determine the best shoe for their bodies’ movements.
“They put you on a treadmill and see 
your running,” said Gregory, a UF advertis-ing freshman and avid runner. “They saw the form that I run in and found a shoe that helped my knees and legs.”
An infographic created for Greatist, a 
health and fitness website, titled “Choosing the Right Shoe for Any Type of Exercise,” il-lustrates footwear options for different work-outs.
Whether it’s an initiative to stay active 
in the new year or a preparation for Spring Break, a fitness routine’s success can depend on the type of shoe people slip into.
When looking for a running shoe, the 
graphic suggests something with stability, a stiffer heel, arch support and a cushion that provides shock absorption. 
Dr. Scott Koppel specializes in conditions 
of the foot and ankle at Gainesville’s Fam-ily Podiatry and Vein Care. He said a person needs more support than what the foot can give naturally when running on cement.
“You need a shoe that’s going to hold your foot in place and provide you with more sup-port to cradle the arch,” he said.
Nicholas Lietz, 21, is a manager at the 
Fit2Run in The Oaks Mall and a UF biology senior. He said the main thing to remem-
ber when buying running shoes is your mileage.
For strength and con-
ditioning programs, like CrossFit, Lietz recom-mends Inov-8’s F-Lite or Bare-XF sneakers, which include guards on the in-
side of the shoe to prevent ropeburn.
If you enjoy biking or spinning, Greatist 
recommends a shoe that breathes and has hard soles so that it doesn’t slip off the ped-als.
Hikers should choose between sandals, which breathe better and put less pressure on feet, or a variety of ankle-cut boots suitable for different types of hiking excursions.
Deme Panos, a 22-year-old UF wildlife 
ecology and conservation senior and a leader for TRiP , the Travel and Recreation Program at UF, recommends Vasque boots, because they are durable and give ankle support, or Chaco sandals, because they are easy to walk in.
For weightlifting, being barefoot can 
strengthen muscles and gives the body sta-bility. Some gyms don’t allow this because of sanitation concerns, so minimalist shoes give benefits similar to going barefoot.
No matter what your physical activity is, 
enhance your performance and protect your -
self from injury with comfortable and appro-priate footwear.

Florida center Vicky McIntyre 
has scored a season-high 12 points in her past two games.See story, page 16.Football spring practice
The Gators will begin spring practice on March 13. Spring practice will end with the Orange and Blue Debut on April 6 at Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium.  JOE MORGAN
 Alligator Staff Writer
  According to Will Muschamp, coaching 
is not “add water, instant player.”
  But with the prospect haul he pulled in 
on National Signing Day, Muschamp may 
not need much more than water.
  Florida received 20 letters of intent on 
Wednesday, ﬁ  lling out a 27-member class ranked No. 4 nationally by Rivals. The Gators’ 2012 class ranked third, a nine-spot jump from Muschamp’s ﬁ  rst recruiting class at UF.
  But unlike the past two years, National 
Signing Day 2013 was mostly uneventful for Florida. Only two commits waited until Wednesday to pick UF, and the Gators have seven newcomers already enrolled.
  “It’s a very committed class,” Muschamp 
said. “A lot of these guys were guys that have been committed to us a long time and never took other visits. There wasn’t a lot of ﬂ  ash in their recruiting process, and that’s the kind of guys you want.”
  In addition to nabbing some of the na-
tion’s highest-ranked prospects, Florida suc-ceeded in addressing needs at linebacker, wide receiver and defensive tackle. The Gators signed at least three players with four-star rankings or better at each position.
Linebacker Alex Anzalone is one of two 
ﬁ  ve-star prospects to sign with UF.
  “Those guys want to come in and under-
stand that there’s going to be competition at Florida,” Muschamp said. “I always tell them, ‘We’re going to promise you an op-portunity. I’m not going to promise you anything past that.’”
  The Gators added ﬁ  ve wide receivers, 
a group headlined by four-star prospects Demarcus Robinson and Ahmad Fulwood. Florida’s top ﬁ  ve returning wide receivers combined for 44 receptions and four touch-down catches last season.
  “We’ve improved our depth, and I think 
we’ve improved our talent,” Muschamp said. “(There are) some guys that can come in and compete.”
  One position the Gators failed to bolster 
was quarterback. Following Jacoby Bris-sett’s transfer to NC State, returning starter Jeff Driskel is the lone Florida signal-caller with game experience.
  UF inked three-star quarterback Max 
Staver but came up short in its pursuit of three-star JUCO transfer Tanner McEvoy, who committed to Wisconsin on Monday. Junior Tyler Murphy will likely serve as UF’s backup quarterback in 2013.
  “I don’t have a very high comfort level, 
obviously,” Muschamp said of the Gators’ depth at quarterback. “Those guys haven’t played a lot, but they’re going to get oppor-tunities this spring to continue to develop within what we do.”

Florida coach Will Muschamp speaks with reporters during his National Signing Day 
press conference on Wednesday at Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium.
 Muschamp ﬁ  nalizes nation’s No. 4 recruiting class
  National Signing Day needs to go.
  Recruiting lasts year round. It never stops.
  Players change their cell phone numbers and waste hours talking to re-
porters. That time would be better spent trying to get a prom date.
  For a day, though, recruiting takes over the airwaves.  ESPN emanated from Florida’s campus and ran nearly 12 hours of programming 
about recruiting on Wednesday.
  Coach Will Muschamp held a news conference to com-
ment on UF’s 27 new players. Seven have been on campus since January.
  Rankings are ﬁ  nalized and hats are chosen.   The pageantry has reached a new level.   Former Georgia running back Isaiah Crowell brought a 
bulldog puppy on stage during his signing in 2011.
  After a felony weapons charge, he plays for Alabama 
State.
  There’s the problem with recruiting.
  Half of Florida’s 2011 class has either transferred or stopped playing.  A third of the 2010 class suffered the same fate.  Nobody remembers when a kid signed a letter. They do remember the touch-
downs he scored or the tackles he made.
  Unfortunately, NSD excess is here to stay for one reason: Recruiting equals big 
business.

FIVE-STAR RECRUITING PROSPECT.

  TAMPA — Vernon Hargreaves III remains 
uninterested in national attention, regardless of how much his play warrants it.
  Hargreaves, the top-ranked defensive 
back in the Class of 2013 and a consensus ﬁ  ve-star prospect, is unlike many elite high school athletes. He has never relished the limelight, instead preferring to quietly handle his busi-ness.
  For many players, National Signing Day is 
an opportunity to not only choose where they will attend college, but a chance to use their decision as leverage for time in the spotlight. 
  Hargreaves chose a different approach, 
signing with the Gators at Tampa Wharton High in front of a small group of friends, fam-ily and faculty a few minutes after 9 a.m. on Wednesday.
  “Once you take all your ofﬁ  cial (visits), 
you know where you want to go,” Har-greaves said. “Recruits just like to play games and keep all the attention, but there is no need for that. I knew where I wanted to go.”
  The 5-foot-11, 185-pound cornerback is 
the gem of coach Will Muschamp’s class.   Rivals rates Hargreaves the nation’s No. 
2 overall prospect. He recorded 110 tackles, ﬁ  ve interceptions and ﬁ  ve forced fumbles during his senior season at Wharton. 
  He continued to impress after the season, 
notching ﬁ  ve tackles, two pass breakups and an interception en route to being named MVP of the Under Armour All-America Game on 
January 4.
  “Vernon is a great play-
er,” Wharton coach David 
Mitchell said. “He’s stayed straight on his path. The things you see from him came from his parents.”
  Vernon’s father, Ver-
non Hargreaves II, was named linebackers coach 
at Houston on Tuesday after working as the special teams coordinator and defensive ends coach at USF. 
  The elder Vernon has played an important 
role throughout his son’s recruitment process, which began when schools started contacting Hargreaves when he was in seventh grade. 
  “He never wavered one minute during the 
whole process,” Hargreaves II said. “Hope-fully that single-mindedness will carry him through the rest of his career.”

on July 26 and has been steadfast in his 
loyalty to Muschamp and his coaching staff.
Despite receiving more than 40 schol-
arship offers and countless inquiries about his interest in other programs, he never second-guessed his decision.
“If you can make a decision and go 
with it, now there is never going to be a question about what you are doing,” Hargreaves II said. “I’m glad that hap-pened. We are excited for him and about him.” 
Hargreaves, though talented, will 
have to compete for playing time next season. 
Florida returns Marcus Roberson, 
Loucheiz Purifoy and Jaylen Watkins — the top three cornerbacks on the depth chart.
The Gators also have Cody Riggs, 
who missed the season due to a fracture in his right foot. 
But Hargreaves gravitates toward 
competition rather than notoriety.
“I’m actually leaving in May because 
my school is going to let me graduate earlier than the original date, so I get to go up there for Summer A,” Hargreaves said. “I’m just going to try and fit in wherever I can.”

round. Scores of 7-on-7 prep tour -

The bigger the business, the big-

For the Southeastern Confer -

SEC teams hauled in six of the 
top 10 classes. Ole Miss created Twitter chaos by nabbing the top defensive end, offensive tackle and wide receiver in the Class of 2013. Can’t blame players wanting to snap up the chance for a starring role in “The Blind Side 2” over re-ceiving a face full of angry Mus-champ.
Alabama signed a second elite 
running back to go with incoming back Derrick Henry, the top rusher in high school history.
Florida brings in the No. 4 class in the nation, according to Rivals, with 15 players on defense and 12 on offense.
There’s a defensive tackle named 
Darious ‘Bear’ Cummings and a safety named Keanu ‘Kiki’ Neal.

Florida filled its needs with its 
latest class, even if Wednesday wasn’t the circus seen in Oxford, Miss.
Only two players commit to 
Florida on NSD. That’s a testament to Muschamp and his staff’s ability to build lasting relationships.
This de facto national holiday 
celebrates the players who haven’t made up their minds. The players who, in some cases, manipulated the recruiting process. 
It’s time to ditch National Sign-

PORT ST. LUCIE –– In the gymnasium at St. 
Lucie West Centennial High, three hats — Miami, 
Florida and Alabama — sat on a table in front of senior Jay-nard Bostwick. Though Bostwick ap-peared undecided, his mind was already made up. 
Bostwick picked up the blue Gators cap, put 
it on and proceeded to sign his letter of intent to play football for coach Will Muschamp.
“I really narrowed it down last night,” Bost-
wick said. “I thought about the [Southeastern Conference] and the opportunity I had with the Gators. I knew that they’re a competitive team and probably have a good chance to go to another bowl game.”
When Bostwick first arrived at Centennial, 
he didn’t have much experience playing foot-ball. The defensive tackle had only played a few games for the Port St. Lucie Athletic Association Youth Football Program during his eighth-grade year before suffering a lower back injury. 
Bostwick possessed raw talent, and Centennial 
coach Ron Parker saw potential. Bostwick’s posi-tive attitude and energy helped him become just the second player in Centennial history to play varsity football as a freshman. 
Parker never regretted the decision. “The biggest thing I told the scouts is, ‘He 
doesn’t take plays off in practice,’” Parker said. “My son had to line up against [Bostwick] last year. He turned around and looked at me, and I said, ‘Well, good luck.’ And there he went flying through the air. But Jay-nard’s a very respectful player. He’ll knock you down, pick you up and just be ready for the next play.”
As a junior, Bostwick recorded 74 tackles, in-
cluding seven tackles for a loss and two sacks. Bostwick hoped to put up even bigger numbers during his senior campaign, but Parker made a decision that hurt Bostwick’s stats.
“I dismissed a starting defensive end on the 
other side … because he didn’t do what he was supposed to do,” Parker said. “So, Jay-nard had to move around a lot. We put him in the middle, they’d run outside. We put him on the edge, they’d run to the other side. So, it was frustrat-ing.”
Still, Bostwick tallied 73 tackles with seven tackles for a loss during a 1-8 season. Bostwick finished his high school career with 176 tackles, 15 tackles for a loss, three sacks and one fumble recovery.
When Bostwick first started playing football, 
he never thought he would continue playing past high school. But the four-star recruit’s talents quickly earned him recognition and scholarship offers to 19 colleges. 
Bostwick then narrowed his list down to six. 
After cutting Michigan State, Oklahoma and Or-egon, only three remained. 
The Crimson Tide was the first of the final 
three eliminated. Bostwick didn’t want to attend school out of state. 
The decision between the Hurricanes and the 
Gators proved tough for the se-nior.
Bostwick has strong fam-
ily ties to Miami. His cousin, Thurston Armbrister, is a UM linebacker. Although Bostwick 
calls Miami home, he put fam-ily ties aside and picked UF.
“I just knew [Florida] had 
the facilities to take care of 
me,” Bostwick said. “Everyone assured me that they’d be by my side the whole way through, and I know that I have a good opportunity to have early playing time. It’s in the SEC, so I had to go where there’s the best competition.”
Muschamp added: “Jay-nard was a young man 
that really came down to three schools, and we were real pleased to get him here on the last visit. He had a great visit, and we felt very comfortable. Travaris Robinson did a great job recruiting him throughout the entire process.”
With Sharrif Floyd and Omar Hunter gone 
from Florida’s roster, Bostwick will join a host of Gators competing for time at defensive tackle. Bostwick will battle Leon Orr, Darious Cum-mings, Caleb Brantley, Damien Jacobs and Domi-nique Easley to play inside.
“I can’t guarantee nothing, and they told me 
that they can’t guarantee me nothing, but they said I have a really good chance of playing fresh-man year,” Bostwick said. “I’m just going to go out there and work my hardest and try to get on the field.”

Will Yeguete’s night in Fayetteville, 
Ark., lasted less than a minute.
During No. 2 Florida’s 80-69 loss to 
Arkansas on Tuesday , Yeguete checked 
into the game with 16:44 remaining in the first half but limped to the bench at the 15:52 mark after experiencing dis-comfort caused by tendinitis in his right knee. The injury has been a season-long issue for the junior forward. 
Yeguete was re-evaluated by the 
team’s training staff at halftime and ruled out for the remainder of the contest. 
Coach Billy Donovan said after the 
game that Yeguete would undergo an MRI on Wednesday to determine the ex-tent of the injury . Donovan will address the results this afternoon. 
“I don’t know what it is,” Donovan 
said. “He’s been dealing with some swell-ing now for a few weeks. He’s been very , very limited in practice the last couple of weeks. … He said he felt like he tweaked his knee.”
The Razorbacks took advantage of 
Yeguete’s absence, shooting 51.3 percent on two-pointers and 44.4 percent from three-point range. 
The Gators (18-3, 8-1 Southeastern 
Conference) were thin in the frontcourt Tuesday night with Yeguete out and Pat-ric Young dealing with foul trouble.
Young committed two fouls in the 
first 6:31 and was benched for about 7 minutes. He fouled out with 3:41 left. 
In 26 minutes, Young scored nine 
points but grabbed only four boards.
“We were in a bind the whole first 
half,” Donovan said. “I generally don’t play a guy with two fouls, but because of our frontcourt depth and fatigue, I had to sub (Erik) Murphy some. We were prob-ably pretty fortunate to get out of the half with Patric only having two fouls.”
Playing without its top two rebound-
ers in Young (6.6 rebounds per game) and Yeguete (6.3 rebounds per game) for much of the first half, Florida was out-rebounded 20-14 in the first 20 minutes. Arkansas had nine players log more than 13 minutes and led 43-26 at halftime.
“The type of style we play is hard to 
play against, especially if you’re playing six to seven to eight guys,” Razorbacks forward Marshawn Powell said. 
With a shortage of frontcourt depth, 
Florida’s inside-out game was hurting and its three-point attempts were often contested. After entering the game shoot-ing 51.2 percent from outside, Murphy scored nine points on 2-of-7 shooting, hitting only 1 of 6 three-pointers. 
Florida became reliant on three-
pointers, heaving 27 of its 56 shots from behind the arc and making 10. 
“A lot of what they want to do is pen-
etrate and get it out to the three-point shooters,” Arkansas coach Mike Ander -
son said. “A key is not letting Murphy get off. He’s a tough matchup for a lot of people. But for us, I thought we did a good job of finding him.”
Working his way back from a high left ankle sprain, Casey Prather also strug-gled. In 18 minutes, the 6-foot-6 forward recorded two turnovers and committed four fouls without scoring a point. 
Arkansas’ bench outscored Florida’s 
reserves 40-12. The Razorbacks’ front-court scored 35 points, while the Gators’ big men managed only 19.
“We were a short-manned team, but 
we didn’t play through the things that were necessary to win the game,” Dono-van said. “We’ve dealt with a lot of inju-ries and guys being in and out of games. ... You’ve got to be resilient.”

Lack of frontcourt depth costly in loss
PHILLIP HEILMAN

Two games are hardly enough to be considered 
a representative sample, but for Vicky McIntyre and 
the Gators, they were small steps in the right direc-tion. 
McIntyre finished with 12 points on 4-of-8 shoot-
ing during a 69-64 loss to Missouri on Jan. 31. Three days later, she again finished with 12 points, making each of her five field goal attempts in an 87-54 victory against Alabama, a win that snapped Florida’s five-game losing streak. 
“One of the things that seems to have eluded us, 
especially during the time when we were struggling, was consistency,” coach Amanda Butler said. “To have someone have two back-to-back really solid performances may not sound like a big deal to some-one else or on a different team, but back-to-back solid performances are really important for us right now.” 
McIntyre’s consecutive 12-point efforts were the 
first two times she scored in double figures since she tallied 10 points during Florida’s 61-55 win against Mississippi State on Jan. 10. 
The 6-foot-7 center has scored in double figures 
on just two other occasions this season. The timing of her improved performance bodes well for the Gators. 
Senior Jennifer George has struggled offensively 
as she continues to deal with the effects of two sepa-rations of her right shoulder. George leads the team in scoring with 12.3 points per game, but she has scored in double figures only once since Jan. 6.
“Jennifer is still trying to find her groove, get her 
groove back and in particular, Vicky and (Christin) Mercer have had some really important performanc-es for us,” Butler said.
McIntyre has been particularly efficient during 
Southeastern Conference play . 
Despite logging just 15.8 minutes per contest, she 
is second on the team with a 48.9 field goal percent-age. The junior’s 1.6 blocks per game rank sixth in the conference. 
Endurance is an issue for McIntyre, and she is 
often only on the floor for 3 or 4 minutes at a time. However, her size makes her a key role player.
“I have to do what I can with what I get,” McIn-
tyre said. “I’m going to give my team as much as I can when I’m in there.”
