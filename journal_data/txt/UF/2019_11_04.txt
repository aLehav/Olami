FOOTBALL

Florida, much like a lot of 
fans, promised it would behave 
better this year at The World’s 
Largest Outdoor Cocktail Party. 
It wouldn’t let things get out of 
hand in Jacksonville, again — as 
they so often do, both on and off 
the ﬁ  eld.
The Gators were different this 
year, or so everyone thought.
“It took us three quarters to 
ﬁ  nd out what worked best and we 
started executing at a high level,” 
quarterback Kyle Trask said. “We 
just need to ﬁ  nd a way to do that 
sooner, I guess.”
By that point, UF had dug itself 
into a two-touchdown hole. This 
was due to its atrocious third-
down defense, which allowed 12 
third-down conversions in the 
game, and a no-show by the run-
ning game, which rushed for 21 
yards on the day.
The Gators didn’t roll over, 
though. Trask led two scoring 
drives in the fourth quarter, nar-
rowing the gap to a more respect-able 24-17 loss at the hands of 
the Bulldogs for the third-straight 
year.
Dan Mullen was asked after 
the game how close his team is to 
its SEC East rival.
“Seven points,” he said, terse-
ly.
He was then asked if this game 
is a measuring stick for where the 
program is at. In response, Mul-
len pointed at the box score on 
the lectern in front of him and 
once again offered, “We’re seven 
points behind Georgia.”
But the sheet of paper in front 
of him told a different story.
The Gators were out-gained by 
more than 100 yards, sniffed the 
red zone just once and lost the 
time-of-possession battle by more 
than 11 minutes.
Seven points. But don’t forget 
the asterisk.
The ﬁ  nal score was mislead-
ing. UF managed three points 
heading into the ﬁ  nal quarter and 
never had a clear path to victory.
Poor execution and game man-
agement in the biggest game of UF sees a lot to play for

BOOKS TO GO TO 
UF HEALTH SHANDS 
PEDIATRIC UNIT
By Tien Le
Alligator Staff Writer
English-speaking chil-
dren in U.S. hospitals may 
take Harry Potter and Na-
tional Geographic Kids for 
granted. But for Spanish-
speaking patients at UF 
Health Shands Hospital, a 
book in their native lan-
guage is hard to come by. 
The UF Hispanic Stu-
dent Association and UF 
Mobile Outreach Clinic, 
a bus that goes around 
Gainesville providing free 
primary care, are hosting 
a book drive for the UF 
Health Shands pediatric 
unit this week, said Isa-bella Oliver, HSA president 
and 22-year-old UF interna-
tional studies and political 
science senior. 
They’re asking for Span-
ish-language children’s 
books to diversify Shands’ 
library for Hispanic chil-
dren. Oliver said the books 
are important for children 
and families who do not 
speak English to have the 
same resources no matter 
their background and for 
families that want to teach 
their kids about different 
cultures. 
The drive starts today 
and lasts until Sunday. 
Through Friday, donors 
can drop books off at the 
Hispanic-Latino Engage-
ment Center, or La Salita, 
on the second ﬂ  oor of the 
Reitz Union. On Sunday, donors can drop off books 
at the Carnaval Service 
Day on Hume Field at 11 
a.m. Donors can also drop 
off books during Hispanic 
Alumni Reunion events 
this weekend.
Oliver, who was born 
in Venezuela, spent three 
days recovering from heart 
surgery at Miami Chil-
dren’s Hospital when she 
was 12. Her mother gave 
her books in Spanish to 
keep her mind off treat-
ments and maintain her 
Spanish ﬂ  uency.
“You can watch TV 
shows, any type of differ-
ent thing that helps keep 
you distracted from your 
time at the hospital,” Oli-
ver said. “But, in my opin-ABOUT 100 RALL Y 
AGAINST BOTTLING 
IN GINNIE SPRING 
By Jordyn Kalman
Alligator Staff Writer
Protesters young and old 
pumped large signs reading 
“SOS: Save our Springs” 
and “Water For life, not 
Proﬁ  t” into the air as they 
marched in a single-ﬁ  le line 
on the sidewalk.
Their chants, ‘Whose 
water? Our water,’ and, ‘On 
three, no Nestlé,’ echoed 
down the streets of High 
Springs, hoping to get the 
local government to pay at-
tention.
Water advocates, High 
Springs residents and stu-
dents gathered Friday at 6 
p.m. to protest a permit that would allow Nestlé Waters 
North America to bottle 
1.152 million gallons of 
water from Ginnie Springs 
a day.
More than 100 protest-
ers gathered in the ﬁ  eld be-
tween Main Street and the 
Brewery of High Springs 
to listen to ﬁ  ve speakers 
including Alachua County 
Commissioner Marihelen 
Wheeler, Isaac Augspurg, 
Emma Turner and Merrillee 
Malwitz-Jipson. The event 
was organized by local en-
vironmental groups Our 
Santa Fe River, Climate Ac-
tion Gator and Sierra Club 
Suwanee. 
Malwitz-Jipson, an 
event organizer, said she 
hopes this protest will get 
the attention of the High 
Springs and Fort White lo-cal governments and the 
Suwannee River Water 
Management District.
She said it was encour-
aging to see so many peo-
ple from all areas and ages 
uniting under one cause. 
More than twice the num-
ber of people she expected 
came out.  
“I think it was an ex-
tremely successful citizen 
empowering event,” Mal-
witz-Jipson said. “I felt en-
couraged and hopeful that 
more people will get in-
volved with the water per-
mitting process in Florida.”
Following the protest, 
Malwitz-Jipson said she 
hopes citizens will write in

Masoumeh Manshadi, Amin T aghikhani’s mother, speaks at his memorial service Sunday. 
She thanked the school and the people who spoke in T aghikhani’s honor, which included UF 
President Kent Fuchs and the Associate Dean of the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences 
Joel Brendemuhl. T aghikhani died on Oct. 8, his 20th birthday. 
About 20 people, including UF Presi-
dent Kent Fuchs and Dean of Students 
Heather White, attended UF student Amin 
Taghikhani’s memorial service on Sunday 
in the Baughman Center. 
Taghikhani, who was studying biology 
and on track to graduate in 2020, died on 
Oct. 8, four days after he suffered blunt-
force trauma in a motorcycle accident. It 
was his 20th birthday. 
“He is born into a new world, an eter-
nal life,” Taghikhani’s mother, Masoumeh 
Manshadi, said during the service. “I don’t 
feel I am separated from him because I be-
lieve that our souls are united. I had a bless-
ing to have him for 20 years — 20 years full 
with happiness, joy and wonder.” 
Joel Brendemuhl, Associate Dean of the

said Taghikhani will receive his bachelor 
of science posthumously. UF holds memorial service for student who died in motorcycle crash

you away from your current

Isabel Maldonado, a 
22-year-old UF alumna and a 
care coordinator for the Mo-
bile Outreach Clinic, contact-
ed HSA when a nurse practi-
tioner from the clinic told her 
the hospital has little to no 
books in Spanish.  
“Knowing how nervous 
kids can be when they go into 
the hospital setting, it was re-
ally important for me to do 
something to change that,” 
Maldonado said.
Carmen Florez, HSA vice 
president of operations and

Thiago’s family moved 
to Gainesville to seek better

like Thiago’s books to read to 
their kids. 
“This book drive allows 
these children that are young

eration, where we often lose 
our ability to speak Spanish, 
to continue to read and prac-
tice our language,” she said.

tle@alligator.orgMONEY ACCOUNTED FOR 
MORE THAN 1 PERCENT OF 
FLORIDA’S GDP
By Kyle Wood
Alligator Staff Writer
Florida’s ﬂ  agship univer-
sity contributed billions to the 
state’s economy, and the high 
numbers are no surprise to 
some.  
The analysis of the 2017-2018 
ﬁ  scal year shows UF is respon-
sible for more than 1 percent of 
the state’s gross domestic prod-
uct and workforce, as well as 
more than half of the workforce 
in Alachua County.
UF’s Institute of Food and 
Agricultural Sciences commis-
sioned the report, written by UF 
faculty Alan W. Hodges, an ex-
tension scientist; Caleb A. Stair, 
a lecturer and Christa D. Court, 
an assistant professor. Hodges 
said the UF Ofﬁ  ce of Govern-
ment and Community Relations 
and the Vice President of Re-
search asked for the report.
“Many universities are in-
terested in demonstrating their 
economic contributions to the 
region, and routinely do eco-nomic studies such as this to 
get support from local and state 
government and the private sec-
tor,” Hodges wrote in an email.
In total, the university and 
UF-related entities contributed 
more than $16 billion to the 
state economy in that ﬁ  scal 
year. According to U.S. News 
and World Report, Florida is the 
ninth-largest economy in the 
country. UF is also responsible 
for more than 130,000 full-time 
and part-time jobs in the state.
Those numbers, “though 
staggering,” were mostly ex-
pected and consistent with the 
university’s growth, Hodges 
said.
The statistics collected were 
compared with numbers from 
2014-2015, which is the last 
time the study was conducted. 
The report showed increases 
across the board in categories 
including industry output, value 
added, labor income and prop-
erty tax. The only decrease was 
in employment, which fell by 
0.7 percent.
“I was surprised at the large 
and growing contributions of 
the many direct support organi-
zations,” he said.
Direct support organizations, which are private, separate in-
corporated businesses, such as 
the University Athletic Associa-
tion, had the greatest industry 
output at $8 million. The output 
is also larger than university 
operations’ $5 million, which 
refers to the maintenance and 
preservation of university as-
sets. It also had the second-most 
full-time jobs, behind university 
operations, according to the re-
port.
Zach Torres, a 19-year-old 
UF economics sophomore, was 
not shocked by the results of the 
report.
“With relation to every sur-
rounding city and county, UF 
practically runs this town,” he 
said. “Without UF, the popula-
tion would be a third of what it 
is now.”
He said UF’s standing as one 
of the bigger universities in the 
country explains the numbers.
“It is arguably the most 
prominent university, think 
tank or whatever you want to 
call it, that Florida has to offer,” 
he said.
@Kkylewood 
kwood@alligator.org‘UF practically runs this town’: UF 
contributed billions to state economyernment meetings regarding this 
issue. 
Commissioner Wheeler said 
she came to the protest because 
this is an issue she cares deeply 
about. Before being elected, she 
spent eight years working with a 
variety of water groups in Florida 
and has advocated for the con-
servation of rivers, springs and 
coastal waters.
Because she represents Dis-
trict 2, which includes High 
Springs, Wheeler said it was es-
pecially important for her to be there. 
“It’s so exciting to be here,” 
Wheeler told the crowd. “We 
have to make sure we are protect-
ing this water because once it’s 
gone, there is no replacing it.”
Mackenzie Grifﬁ  n, a 20-year-
old UF Chemistry sophomore and 
Climate Action Gator member, 
came to the protest because she 
feels it is up to the next genera-
tion to ﬁ  ght for the environment. 
“I just want my planet to be 
clean for future generations,” Grif-
ﬁ  n said. “It’s all connected, we 
have to prepare for the future.”
Fort White resident Lucy Anstey attended the protest because she 
said living on the river made her 
understand the importance of keep-
ing water levels high and maintain-
ing the health of the water.
In her more than 20 years of 
living here, Anstey said she has 
seen many other bottling compa-
nies come in to take the water.
“Without the river, I have no 
place to live,” Anstey said. “What 
gives big corporations the right to 
come in and take our water? We 
can’t accept this.”

11 a.m.THE HOLIDAY REMEMBERS 
DEAD FAMIL Y, FRIENDS 
By Emma Barsky
Alligator Contributing Writer
More than 300 students honored the 
spirits of their loved ones and learned 
about one of Mexico’s most well-known 
holidays in the Reitz Grand Ballroom 
Friday night.
The Mexican American Student As-
sociation, UF Hispanic-Latino Affairs 
and GatorNights gathered to celebrate 
the Day of the Dead, or Día de Muertos, 
with food, music and crafts said Benny 
Gama, MASA chief of staff.
Gama said he thinks UF students are 
not fully aware of Mexican culture, so 
he organized a Day of the Dead celebra-
tion to show the history of the holiday 
and what it means.
“You are supposed to mourn the dead. But to a certain extent,” Gama 
said. “You are also supposed to cel-
ebrate their legacy and the life that they 
lived while they were here on earth.”
MASA began planning the event in 
August. The organization has never 
had such a large turnout at a Day of 
the Dead celebration, he said. Members 
used to celebrate in the Reitz Hispanic-
Latinx Engagement Center, known as 
La Salita, with about 30 students. 
In Mexican culture, it is believed that 
the dead come back on this day to cel-
ebrate with loved ones and appreciate 
their decorated altar, Gama said. Those 
who have died are said to smell their fa-
vorite foods and admire the flowers and 
commemorating objects on display.
An altar at the festival displayed 
traditional elaborate cut tissue paper 
known as papel picado, roses, mari-
golds, which are the “flower of the 
dead” and photos of Mexican cultural icons such as Frida Kahlo and Selena 
Quintanilla. Students also placed pho-
tos of deceased family members on the 
altar and decorated traditional sugar 
skulls. 
A lively mariachi band, Mariachi In-
ternacional Tapatío from Orlando, took 
to the papel picado-decorated stage 
along with Mahetzi, a traditional folk-
loric dance group from Clearwater.
Brauilio Juarez, a 29-year-old UF 
coastal and oceanographic engineering 
doctoral student, said his favorite parts 
of the event were the performances and 
the feeling represented at UF.
“It showed the community the 
variety of the Mexican culture with 
traditional dancing and music perfor-
mances,” he said. “To the Mexican 
community, it reminded us how beauti-
ful our culture is.”MONDAY, NOVEMBER 4, 2019   ALLIGATOR   5

to learn about it, and get involved in it and realize where we came from, ” Adams said.

ecosystems: the Longleaf pine population.
The $300,000 award, provided by the National Fish and Wild-
life Foundation, will be used by the nonprofit organization to 
educate private landowners about better managing their proper-
ties and, subsequently, improving the habitats of wildlife that live 
there, said Alachua Conservation Trust executive director Tom 
Kay. 
“It’s incredibly critical because, frankly, without this funding 
in place, we wouldn’t be able to do it,” Kay said.
He said the grant will ensure that the roughly 450 wildlife 
species belonging to the Longleaf habitat, such as Red-cockaded 
Woodpeckers, gopher tortoises, indigo snakes and pine snakes, 
continue to have a home. 
The funds will also be devoted to the restoration and develop-
ment of Alachua and Marion County’s Longleaf pine population, 
which he said has drastically declined over time.  
Barry Coulliette, Alachua Conservation Trust’s private lands 
stewardship specialist, said the funding will also allow their orga-
nization to continue teaching local landowners about prescribed 
burning, a technique in which wildfires are deliberately started 
for forest management purposes.  
The procedure is intended to help restart the life cycle of cer-
tain plant species and remove dead materials from the ground, 
he said. 
Coulliette said Alachua Conservation Trust holds training 
workshops throughout the year to teach landowners how to safe-
ly and properly execute a prescribed burn. 
“We’re all about preserving natural land for future genera-
tions to be able to enjoy,” he said.

The power in profanity and the beneﬁ  ts of using it
A curse slips off your tongue as you trip 
up the stairs. Obscenity rips through 
your throat at the touch of a hot sur-
face. A “dirty word” slithers over gap-
ing lips when the clock strikes 12:01 
a.m. and you remember that discussion post 
was due at 11:59 p.m.
Curse words have always been powerful. 
They’re poignant yet inappropriate. They’re 
untouchable. Words like “fork” and “shoot” 
replace them, their fraternal twins that pull 
punches. If profanity spills out, its often whis-
pered for fear of its power. 
In the book “What the F,” cognitive scientist Benja-
min Bergen said, “We’re training kids, socially, that these 
words are powerful.” I think their power can be positive. 
According to a study co-authored by Richard Ste-
phens, senior lecturer of psychology at Keele University, 
cursing can actually increase your pain tolerance. Ver-
balizing profanity diminishes your pain, and that’s what 
happens when you accidentally curse. 
When cursing is intentional, its effects are ampliﬁ  ed. 
Cursing catches your attention with its boldness and 
bolsters its surrounding words. 
On Urban Dictionary, 2,625 people agree with the def-
inition of f*** being, “the standard unit of measurement 
used to describe the amount an individual cares about 
something.” And let me tell you, there’s power in really 
f***ing caring about something. 
Lana Del Rey’s most recent album, “Norman F***ing 
Rockwell!,” is, naturally, about a relationship with Nor-
man Rockwell. An album review published by Pitchfork 
calls the addition of f***ing in the title a “mark of irrev-
erence, or enthusiasm, or both.” 
F*** raises the importance of a phrase. It increases 
the passion in words and makes people open their ears to listen more intently. A 2012 study by Danette 
Ifert Johnson at Ithaca College even illustrated 
that cursing makes your argument more effec-
tive and persuasive. 
Cursing adds an extra layer of conﬁ  dence. 
Serena Kerrigan, Reﬁ  nery 29 host and produc-
er,  branded herself as Serena F***ing Kerri-
gan (SFK). 
In her YouTube series for Reﬁ  nery 29 en-
titled “Ask Serena,” Kerrigan describes how 
the nickname was created when she was in 
college. Her conﬁ  dence was low and her inse-
curities were apparent. 
Today, she is labeled the queen of conﬁ  dence by al-
phasixty. “I’m extra,” she said in a video. “I don’t care 
what people think about me and guess what? I love my-
self.” 
The curse word “b****” has been reclaimed by wom-
en recently, switching from an insult to a powerful iden-
tity. 
The most popular line from Lizzo’s No.1 hit “Truth 
Hurts,” according to Mashable, is: “I just took a DNA 
test/ Turns out I’m 100% that b****.” 
On the same token, curse words can cut through a 
person like a trigger. Their power is sourced from their 
unacceptability. The danger associated with the words 
makes them intriguing. 
Like all words, they should be directed carefully and 
thoughtfully. I’m not saying that kids should run rampant 
on the playground screaming f-bombs. However, there’s 
nothing wrong with throwing out a couple curse words 
when you’re grown, just for some s***s and giggles. 
Cursing is powerful. So, might as well say, “F*** it,” 
and embrace profanity.

celebrating stealing from 
Native Americans?
Halloween may be over, but we’re still concerned about 
bad holiday practices, especially here in the U.S. 
There’s no denying the racist tendencies in U.S. It’s 
obvious in our history books, it’s obvious in the lack 
of racial representation at UF and its even obvious 
within the holidays the U.S. chooses to celebrate. 
The country needs to recognize all holidays, including from 
the cultures it’s so “proud” of having. While we’ve battled to 
get to a better place today, it seems like we are still drowning 
in a sea of racism and lies.
Let’s try to get our heads above the water, America. Minori-
ties have suffered long enough.
Out of 10 federal holidays, only one celebrates minorities: 
Martin Luther King Jr. Day. But even that effort initially faced 
resistance. Former North Carolina Sen. Jesse Helms held a 
ﬁ  libuster against the bill, and demanded the FBI release ﬁ  les 
from their investigation of King because Helms believed King 
to be a communist. Although the bill passed 78-22, we can’t 
help but think about how difﬁ  cult the battle must have been. 
The bill ﬁ  nally passed nearly 20 years after King’s death; it’s 
just disappointing to see how much time the U.S. needed to 
get over its bigotry.
Today, it seems like the U.S. still needs to improve. There 
are currently-celebrated federal holidays that undermine the 
tragedies minorities have faced, and one of the most problem-
atic is coming soon — Thanksgiving.
It just feels inappropriate to celebrate the history of Thanks-
giving. It was enacted as a national holiday to celebrate a 
peaceful harvest between Native Americans and Pilgrims, but 
really it’s a facade to hide the atrocities colonists committed 
against their so-called “friends.” 
The only thing we should really give thanks for is the short 
vacation we get. Although we enjoy the time we have to spend 
with our families, reparations and social reform would deﬁ  -
nitely be a better gift. 
By principle, Thanksgiving is a great holiday. Families have 
the opportunity to come together from across the nation to eat 
a hearty meal and have a good time. As the most overworked 
developed nation in the world, we need some time with our 
loved ones to make things less stressful, and Thanksgiving is 
perfect for that.
The only people we should be thankful for during this holi-
day season are those who are brave enough to make a family 
feast, and the ones who are trying to make change.
Many people now celebrate November as National Ameri-
can Indian Heritage Month, and we encourage you to partici-
pate in the different activities that the UF Indigenious Ameri-
can Student Association offers. Even if you’re not a member 
of any Indigenous groups, it’s good to be exposed to the rich 
history that has been repressed for so long. 
We need to take back our history. American culture isn’t 
simply a collective of people celebrating one thing. Although 
we are more progessive today, the U.S. still doesn’t acknowl-
edge its past and the people who  built it. Why isn’t Juneteenth 
a federal holiday? Or even Emancipation Day? Is the end of 
hundreds of years of captivity, or the freedom of millions not 
enough to celebrate?
Maybe the U.S. really doesn’t want to recognize its history 
—  or maybe we still have some work to do.
Either way, we’re conﬁ  dent something positive is going to 
happen. The holiday season is meant to bring us together, and 
we should use it to support people as well.

For those who are not familiar with Sen.
Kamala Harris, she is one of 18 Demo-
cratic candidates vying to be the presi-
dential nominee. She currently repre-
sents California. 
On both the campaign trail and the debate 
stage, Harris frequently refers to her time 
working as the California attorney general. 
So, Harris should be particularly familiar 
with the law — yet her push to ban Presi-
dent Trump from Twitter contradicts her 
background. 
Harris unapologetically vocalized her de-
sire to remove the president from Twitter. 
On Sept. 30, Harris used her own Twitter ac-
count to tweet, “Look, let’s be honest, @re-
alDonaldTrump’s Twitter account should be 
suspended.” But why should Harris decide 
who has a voice on social media and who 
doesn’t?The original Bill of Rights con-
tained 10 Amendments. Of those 
amendments, the Founding Fa-
thers designated the protection 
of fundamental freedoms as the 
First Amendment. That placement 
was not coincidental. The First 
Amendment is commonly referred 
to as the most important amend-
ment and the backbone of the 
United States. The First Amend-
ment ensures Americans live in 
a society with freedom of speech, 
religion and the press.
Social media is an extension of free 
speech, and I view Twitter as a microphone: 
It is an outlet for all individuals to voice their 
opinions.  
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is another 
politician who communicates frequently via Twitter. I disagree with Ocasio-
Cortez on nearly every topic, but 
I would never want to infringe on 
Ocasio-Cortez’s rights. No voice 
should be silenced because a per-
son or group of people disagrees 
with it.
I can’t come to terms with why 
Harris wants to remove the presi-
dent from Twitter. If Harris genu-
inely believes Trump’s tweets are 
ridiculous and irresponsible, then 
why would she want to shield his 
supposed ignorance from the public? Harris 
should want to spread awareness of Trump’s 
speech. It frightens me that Harris envisions 
a Twitter where only those aligned with her 
political ideology are allowed to speak their 
minds.
Harris’ Trump ban threatens our democ-racy. Although Harris commonly discusses 
her progressive ideas, her current demand 
would be a major step back. No individual 
has the right to decide who gets to employ 
the freedom of speech. 
Whether you like or dislike his content, 
the consequences of banning Trump from 
Twitter are too dangerous. Suspending 
someone from social media simply because 
you do not like what they have to say vio-
lates the First Amendment. If Harris gets her 
way, she will create a detrimental precedent 
that if someone powerful disagrees with you, 
they can infringe upon your free speech. 
We must ﬁ  ght to protect the liberties of all 
people, not just those we agree with.

• It was infamous French statesman

parte who made the following sage 
observation: “In politics, absurdity is 
not a handicap.”
• In 2006, an Illinois police officer 
was arrested for driving under the

• You might be surprised to learn that 
sloths can hold their breath longer than 
dolphins — much longer. Dolphins 
come up to the surface for air about 
every 10 minutes, while sloths can go 
40 minutes without taking a breath. 
• Evidently it’s not just humans who 
associate a deeper voice with maturity 
(and desirability) in males. It seems 
that male owls try to appear more 
macho and attract females by lowering 
the tone of their hoots.
• Did you know that in a random 
group of 23 people, there’s a 50% like-
lihood that two will share a birthday? 
It seems counterintuitive — there are, 
after all, 365 days in a year — but the 
number-crunchers assert that it’s true. 
In a group of 57 people, it’s almost cer -
tain that two of them will have the same 
birthday — the chances are more than 
99%. Once you get up to 124 people, 
the chances are only 1 in 100 trillion that 
there won’t be a duplicated birthday.

the season largely sunk Florida’s hopes 
of claiming its ﬁ  rst division title in three 
years.
Despite its grim chances of playing in 
the conference championship game (Geor-
gia would have to lose two of its four re-
maining games, and Florida would have 
to win out), Mullen and the players said 
there’s still a lot to play for.
“A lot of football still left,” Mullen said. 
“We have three more games to go play and 
a bye week. We’ve qualiﬁ  ed for a bowl 
game, so we’ll get that extra (game).”
The Gators are expected to win out the 
rest of the regular season, according to 
ESPN’s FPI.
Their remaining schedule is a home 
game against Vanderbilt (2-6, 1-4 SEC), at 
Missouri (5-3, 2-2 SEC) and home against 
rival FSU (4-5), which just ﬁ  red coach 
Willie Taggart on Sunday.“It’s a great check of where our char-
acter’s going to be over these next three 
games and what type of team (we are), 
how we’re going to ﬁ  nish this up,” Mul-
len said.
Finishing the regular season 10-2 is 
well within grasp, which would be an im-
provement on Mullen’s 9-3 mark in his 
ﬁ  rst year at the helm. And despite having 
two losses, Florida is still No. 10 in the 
latest AP Top 25 Poll. Its standing is a tes-
tament to the quality of its two losses to 
No. 1 LSU and No. 6 Georgia and the rest 
of its body of work.
“We’re still a good team,” receiver 
Freddie Swain said. “I’m not letting this 
loss deﬁ  ne us. We’re still a good team and 
can still be elite, just got to focus on the 
little things as a team and once we do, 
we’ll be alright.”
@Kkylewood
kwood@alligator.orgFOOTBALL,  from pg. 1‘W e’re 7 points behind Georgia’ 
Samantha Harrison / Alligator Staff
Quarterback Kyle Trask led two fourth-quarter touchdown drives, outscoring the 
Bulldogs 14-10 in the second half. 
I’ll admit it. I fell into the 
trap.
The trap of overana-
lyzing a home win against 
good-but-not-great Au-
burn and a hard-fought road 
loss to maybe-the-best-team-
in-the-country LSU. 
I thought Florida was go-
ing to beat Georgia on Sat-
urday. I didn’t even think 
it’d be particularly close. 
The Gators were trending up, while the 
Bulldogs struggled in their previous two 
games.
Obviously, we all know what hap-
pened next. Quarterback Jake Fromm 
sliced up UF’s secondary like a knife 
through hot butter as UGA rolled to a 24-
17 victory in which the ﬁ  nal numbers on 
the scoreboard were a bit deceiving. In 
actuality, it was a lot uglier.
This year’s Cocktail Party shed light 
on the truth: Coach Dan Mullen has 
taken the program a long way in just 22 
games, but this Florida team isn’t ready 
to run with the big boys.
After the game, he was asked how far 
behind his team is compared to Georgia.
“Seven points.”
That’s a fair answer, but it isn’t so 
simple.
Don’t get me wrong, the Gators are 
ahead of schedule. In Year 2, they seem 
almost guaranteed to repeat at least a 10-
win season, and a New Year’s Six Bowl 
still seems to be their most likely landing 
spot in the postseason.
Considering the roster and program situation Mullen inherited, 
that is phenomenal and de-
serves praise.
But taking a team from 
mediocrity to title conten-
tion is an arduous process. It 
takes elite recruiting, some-
thing that hasn’t exactly been 
Mullen’s strength. It showed 
against Georgia.
The Bulldogs’ last four 
recruiting classes ranked 
second, ﬁ  rst, third and sixth on the 
247Sports composite. Florida’s? Ninth, 
14th, 11th and 12th. That talent discrep-
ancy was apparent on the ﬁ  eld, especially 
along the lines of scrimmage.
It could be seen in Florida’s loss to 
LSU, as well. UF stuck with the Tigers, 
but a single mistake from quarterback 
Kyle Trask — an interception in the end 
zone trailing by seven — derailed the ef-
fort. The Gators are forced to play com-
pletely mistake-free football to contend 
with elite teams. Their margin for error is 
razor-thin, and as long as that’s the case, 
springing big upsets will be a tough ask.
As talented as UF is in certain areas, 
it doesn’t have a championship roster at 
the moment. But that can change fairly 
quickly. Upcoming facility upgrades — 
like the stand-alone football facility, 
expected to be completed by the end of 
2021 — and, more importantly, the dem-
onstration of sustained success and up-
ward trajectory will help a lot.
But for now, expecting Mullen to beat 
the Bulldogs and take charge of the SEC 
East in his second season was probably 
unfair.Georgia loss is a reality checkNothing but Nettuno

By River Wells
Sports Writer
The UF men’s basketball 
team readily handled Lynn 
University last week, but that 
won’t show up on the ofﬁ  cial 
record.
But once it faces off against 
North Florida this Tuesday, the 
result will count, and coach 
Mike White is preparing his 
squad to start off the regular 
season strong and begin what 
will be a three-game homes-
tand with a victory.
Here’s what Florida will be 
looking to improve in its sea-
son opener, and what to ex-
pect from the Ospreys:
Swooping into Action
The Gators will meet North 
Florida for the ﬁ  fth-consec-
utive season come Tuesday, 
and UNF will attempt to get a 
win for the ﬁ  rst time in the se-
ries’ history.
North Florida’s game 
against UF last year ended with 
a 98-66 defeat, and the rest of 
the year served to disappoint. 
The Ospreys ﬁ  nished 16-17 
overall and a measly 5-13 re-
cord on the road, though they 
did make it to the semiﬁ  nals 
in the Atlantic Sun Champion-
ship to end the year.
In 2019, UNF will depend 
on its star player in senior 
guard Ivan Gandia-Rosa, who 
returns to the Ospreys after having led the ASUN in as-
sists per game (5.8) which was 
good for 24th in the NCAA 
overall. Gandia-Rosa led the 
team in points, averaging 13.8 
per game, and scored in the 
double digits in 18 games last 
year. 
After letting Lynn Univer-
sity guard Jordan Allen put 
up 35 points against them last 
Tuesday, the Gators will try to 
prevent Gandia-Rosa from be-
coming a large part of the UNF 
offense.
Florida may have landed 
some notable freshman this 
offseason, but UNF will get to 
see the ﬁ  rst regular-season ac-
tion from its own freshman ac-
quisition in Emmanuel Adedo-
yin. He received a McDonald’s 
All-American nomination and 
averaged nine points, three re-
bounds and six assists during 
his senior year at Oak Ridge 
High School.
Chomping at the Bit
White saw both positives 
and negatives in UF’s exhibi-
tion game, and he stressed one 
aspect in particular as needing 
the most improvement.
“I didn’t think we rebound-
ed the ball very well,” White 
said. “Either offensively or de-
fensively. It’s deﬁ  nitely a con-
cern of this staff leading into 
game one.”
White’s gripe with rebound-
ing factors into the Gators’ 
defensive struggles as of late. It’s an aspect that White and 
other members of the team 
have harped on leading up to 
Tuesday’s game, and after last 
week’s exhibition, sophomore 
guard Andrew Nembhard said 
he believed the team needed 
better communication on de-
fense.
Graduate transfer Kerry 
Blackshear Jr. said Florida has 
been doing their best to ad-
dress that part of their game.
“We have fans out there, 
so it’s a little bit different, a 
little bit harder to hear,” he 
said. “We talked about it in the 
locker room. (We’ve) got to be 
able to echo calls, be able to 
project our voices a lot so we 
can help each other out.”
While White had plenty 
to say about the team’s nega-
tives, he did see some posi-
tives in Florida’s performance, 
including the play of Blacks-
hear Jr. and Nembhard as well 
as UF’s ability to move the ball 
around on offense.
Overall, he said the team 
was in good spirits after the ex-
hibition, and he was optimistic 
about the young squad’s syn-
ergy heading into the Gators’ 
matchup against UNF.
“I liked the culture,” White 
said. “I liked the aura between 
the guys on the ﬂ  oor and on 
the bench.”

rwells@alligator.orgGators open season versus UNFBy Bryan Matamoros
Sports Writer
Florida’s soccer team had one of 
the hardest schedules in the nation for 
the 2019-20 campaign. 
Its toughest stretch came in the 
early portion of the season when the 
Gators faced three top-10 opponents 
in a span of eight days. Then-No. 5 
USC, then-No. 4 UCLA and then-No. 
6 FSU all defeated a UF team that was 
adapting to life without former leaders 
like midfielder Lais Araujo and goalie 
Kaylan Marckese.
Coach Becky Burleigh said she 
constructed the schedule that way to 
prepare her team for the later, more 
important, part of the season. 
Burleigh’s forward-thinking 
worked out for Florida, which earned 
eight victories in its next 10 games. 
But the Gators went winless in the last 
three fixtures of the regular season 
and missed out on the SEC East title.
With the conference tournament 
on the horizon, No. 5 seed UF will 
have to replicate its midseason form against fourth-seeded Texas A&M in the 
quarterfinals.
The Gators and Aggies last met on Oct. 6 
at Donald R. Dizney Stadium in Gainesville.
Texas A&M was ranked 12th in the nation 
at the time, yet it was Florida that came out 
with the 3-1 triumph behind forward Vanessa 
Kara’s two-goal performance.
Kara, however, has not scored a goal 
since.
That’s a streak of six games without find-
ing the back of the net — a cold streak the 
Drexel transfer has experienced before. She 
went scoreless in her first six games donning 
the orange and blue before registering two 
goals against Florida Gulf Coast on Sept. 12.
Kara, who was named to the All-SEC Sec-
ond Team on Sunday, has the makings of a 
game-changing forward: quickness on the 
ball, intelligence off of it and loads of con-
fidence. 
The Gators will rely on her to make an im-
pact in the quarterfinals against Texas A&M, 
just like she did less than a month ago.
Both teams were without usual starters in 
the previous meeting due to national team 
commitments. 
Florida forward Deanne Rose and mid-fielder Ava Kuyken were with Canada and 
England, respectively, while Aggies defender 
Jimena Lopez was with Mexico. But they will 
all be available this time around.
Having Rose and Kuyken allows Burleigh 
to be more flexible offensively.
Whenever Rose is on the pitch, she gar-
ners the attention of several opposing defend-
ers because of her combination of speed and 
strength. The junior has registered five goals 
and two assists despite sporadic playing time 
due to a nagging hamstring injury and duties 
with the Canada National Team.
Although Kuyken has yet to record an 
assist, the freshman puts her teammates in 
scoring positions thanks to the extra space 
that Rose provides.
The duo must work together once again to 
spark the offense for the Gators to advance to 
the semifinals of the conference tournament.

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL
By Graham Marsh
Sports Writer
Florida’s women’s basketball team has 
the opportunity on Tuesday to do what 
it only did once last season: win a road 
game. 
The Gators only won one game on an 
opponent’s home floor in their 2018-19 
campaign. 
Overall, coach Cam Newbauer’s squad 
only won eight times all season, finish-
ing second to last in the SEC, behind 
only Vanderbilt. In 2019, the season tips 
off against Grambling State on the road 
for UF following an 84-38 exhibition win 
against Valdosta State on Wednesday. 
The exhibition showcased areas where 
Florida can thrive in the 2019-20 cam-
paign. Here are three of those:
Smith’s quickness
UF’s starting point guard Kiara Smith 
showed off an impressive first step against 
VSU on Wednesday. She consistently 
blew past whoever the Blazers had guard-
ing her, especially in the first half. Her 
penetration inside was necessary, since Smith and the rest of the Gators struggled 
behind the three-point line at 0-10 in the 
first two quarters.
It opened up the floor for everyone 
else. Smith showed off good court vision 
on Wednesday, she led the team with 20 
points and five assists to make Florida’s 
offense flow. A huge component to that 
was her forcing VSU to play help defense. 
With how streaky the Gators are be-
hind the three-point line, guards consis-
tently getting close to the cup is a must for 
a team that only broke 80 points one time 
last season. 
Williams and Nichols’ size
Forwards Zada Williams and Emer 
Nichols bullied VSU. Over 27 percent of 
UF’s points came from those two players. 
Whenever Smith or fellow guard Laven-
der Briggs fed either of them in the post, 
the Blazers had no answer. 
But as the season begins, those two 
will have to face more size and may not 
get to have their way quite as much as 
they did against VSU. However, it seems 
that Florida will at least have a formidable 
front court. Streaky shooting
The second half was the only time that 
UF shot from beyond the arc with any 
success. While the first half was a zero-
percent effort, the second half was 5-19. 
That is still uninspiring, but UF needs to 
take advantage of any pocket of time that 
anyone has a hot hand. At one point in 
the third quarter, Smith hit two within 
three minutes of each other. 
As a result, Florida had its highest point 
total of any quarter at 29. With the size 
advantage down low, and Smith’s ability 
to penetrate, open looks will be available. 
The Gators just have to occasionally find 
the bottom of the net. 
Guard Danielle Rainey tore her ACL 
last week in practice, so this season al-
ready has a difficult blow before it even 
commences. 
However, as bad as Valdosta State may 
be, Florida dominated the Blazers from 
opening tip to the final buzzer. Perhaps 
that exhibition could bode some sort of 
confidence UF never had a year ago. Per-
haps this year will look differently.

Gators prepare for rematch against Texas A&M in SEC Tournament 
TENNIS

Sports Writer
It was a busy week on the courts for 
Florida men’s and women’s tennis teams.
The men competed in two tournaments: 
the M25 Naples Tournament in Naples, 
Florida, from Monday to Sunday, and Dick 
Vitale Intercollegiate Clay Court Classic in 
Lakewood Ranch, Florida. The women also 
joined the men in Lakewood Ranch after 
the weekend.The Gators’ weekend at the M25 ended 
early in the weekend. The doubles duo 
of junior Oliver Crawford and sophomore 
Sam Riffice made it all the way to the fi-
nals, but it fell in a super tiebreaker in the 
third set to Colombia’s Jose Daniel Bend-
eck and Christian Rodrigues. This was just 
the second loss of the fall season for the 
duo.
At the Clay Court Classic, No. 31 junior 
Andy Andrade won the singles title on 
Sunday, defeating teammate No. 68 Josh Goodger in straight sets 6-0, 7-5. It was his 
second title of the fall season, his first com-
ing in the Bedford Cup on Oct. 13. It was 
also his second title of his playing career 
in this tournament. He won in the fall of 
2017.
The women’s tennis team found suc-
cess this weekend just like the men’s team. 
Florida took home the doubles title on 
Sunday. Sophomore Marlee Zein and se-
nior Tsveta Dimitrova beat Nebraska twins 
Chloe and Ellie Kuckelman 8-2. The Gators  duo was a winning combination this week-
end, going 4-0 over the weekend. Follow-
ing the doubles match, Zein returned to 
the court for the singles title, where she 
fell to Oklahoma’s Marcelina Podlinksa in 
straight sets.
“I was really pleased with our improved 
play and competitive spirit,” coach Roland 
Thornqvist said in a release.
