The cold weather could not stop the excitement in the Swamp Fri-
day night as performances by the UF Fightin’ Gator Marching Band, 
Albert and Alberta, Sister Hazel and The Fray pumped up the Gator Nation for  its 90th Gator Growl, Footprints in the Swamp. 
“There is nothing more special than the spirit of Gator Growl,” 
Associate Vice President of Student Affairs Norbert Dunkel said. “It’s really the epitome of everything the University of Florida stands for — it’s orange; it’s blue; it’s performance; it’s students coming togeth-er; it’s all about the University of Florida.”
The evening began with student dance acts, including Apocalypse and the National Pan-Hellenic Council step team. A teacher band, In Crisis, performed classics such as “We Will Rock You.”
Mascots Albert and Alberta with UF President Bernie Machen 
spoke to the audience. Before the loss on Saturday, Machen, a Van-derbilt alumnus, said, “We’re going to kick Vandy’s butt.”
UF students Jayce Victor and Abby Whiddon were crowned as 
Homecoming king and queen. The original Homecoming Sweet-heart from 1953, Carolyn Strauss, made an appearance to help crown Whiddon. Following the crowning, violinist Josh Vietti played pop music including “Wake Me Up,” by Avicii.

Although the recession broke major 
unemployment records, the number of 
internships offered has increased sig-niﬁ  cantly.
Since the start of the recession, 44 
percent of organizations have increased the number of internship positions, ac-cording to new research from the Soci-ety for Human Resource Management. 
The survey also found 34 percent of 
organizations offered more internships this year compared to 2012.
Tara Fournier, manager of mem-
ber engagement at the society, said it’s more important now than ever before to get an internship because a lot of po-sitions require experience. 
A competitive job market is one of 
the driving forces for students to be more proactive about ﬁ  nding intern-ships, she said.  
“It does take longer for the student 
population to ﬁ  nd work,” Fournier said. “I do think they are starting to understand that it’s important to get internships as early and as often as pos-sible.”   
In 2012, the average time it took an 
unemployed American to ﬁ  nd a job was 39 weeks, according to internships.com.
But the website, the society’s ofﬁ  cial 
partner since 2011, found that seven out of 10 internships turn into full-time jobs.
More than 75 percent of employers 
who offer intern positions pay their in-terns, according to the survey. 
Fournier said employment laws are 
changing, which could explain the in-Number of

A Gainesville man was arrested after po-
lice say he threatened to hire an assassin to 
kill two deputies.
At about 11 p.m. Sunday, Alachua Coun-
ty Sheriff’s deputies arrested 31-year-old Tjamal Evoris Peterson on charges of crimes against a public servant, according to an ASO arrest report.While the deputy was driving Peterson 
to jail after arresting him for an outstanding warrant for violation of probation, Peterson told the deputy he could hire someone to have a person killed for $2,500. 
He went on to threaten the deputy, saying 
the deputy would be off duty at some point, but he himself would be on guard all the time. He advised the deputy to “be ready.”
Peterson also made threats to pay another $2,500 to kill another deputy who had arrest-ed him in the past. 
Once they got to the jail, Peterson told jail 
staff he was going to pay $5,000 to kill the deputies and said he felt like God, according to the report.
The deputy arrested Peterson again then 
booked him into the jail just before midnight, where he remained as of press time in lieu of a $105,000 bond. Man arrested for threatening to hire hit man

Texting may allow couples 
at UF to stay in touch more 
than ever before, but com-municating via text is causing many partners to disconnect.
The Brigham Young Uni-
versity study, which was pub-lished in the Journal of Couple and Relationship Therapy last month, found that heavy tex-ting is linked with relation-ship dissatisfaction in men and women.
The researchers studied 
couples ages 18 to 25 and found that about 82 percent texted each other multiple times every day.
According to the study, tex-
ting generally had a negative effect on relationships, espe-cially when used as a means of communication for serious con-versations. The only instance in which texting had a positive effect was when it was used to express affection.
UF psychology professor 
Laurie Mintz said the ﬁ  ndings make sense because partners can miss many communication cues by texting.  
“No matter how fast some-
one is texting, they’re not going to be able to communicate in the way that they can in per-son,” she said.
Mintz said people rely on 
other forms of communication besides words, like facial ex-pressions, tone and intent, that do not translate into texts.
Mintz said more couples are 
communicating via text for two major reasons: Young adults see it as an appropriate form of communication, and it em-powers them to say things they might not say in person.
“People are emboldened to 
say or do things in writing that they wouldn’t do in person be-cause there is a distance,” she said.
Mintz said discussing a rela-
tionship through written com-munication isn’t always nega-tive. Showing affection toward a partner is positive in any form, she said.
Chen Xie, a UF doctoral stu-
dent who teaches Marriage and Family, said she agrees that tex-ting can have a negative impact on relationships.
“Texting makes it easier for 
people to argue a lot,” she said.
Xie said texting can lead to  
misinterpretation of messages.
“People tend to see more 
negative or bad things through text messages,” she said.
Giovanna Sutherland, a 
19-year-old UF biology fresh-man, said she thinks texting is probably harmful for relation-ships because constantly keep-ing tabs on each other can be tiring.
“When you get a text mes-
sage from someone, you just have to answer,” she said.
Sutherland said texting also 
allows for misinterpretation, but she only thinks it will in-crease with couples.
“It’s the easiest way for com-
munication today,” she said. “You can do it anywhere with-out being caught.”
Mintz said there is one key 
to all healthy relationships: communication.
“It doesn’t matter the age,” 
she said. “From college stu-dents through 70-year-olds, good relationships are built on good communication.”Texting could hurt 
college relationships

As UF’s football ranking dropped, 
so did the ranking of campus sexual 
health services.
UF is No. 15 in the 2013 Trojan 
Sexual Health Report Card. The rank dropped from No. 12 in 2012 and No. 8 in 2011.
The annual survey ranks the sex-
ual health resources available on 140 campuses nationwide. Sperling’s BestPlaces, an independent research ﬁ  rm, graded student health care centers across 11 categories, includ-ing hours of operation, availability of condoms and STI testing.
Bert Sperling, president of Sper-
ling’s BestPlaces, said UF’s strong points are the health center’s hours six days a week, and the availability of walk-in appointments, informa-tion and affordable contraceptives as well as affordable HIV testing.
“In relation to other schools, oth-
er schools are changing their scores as well,” Sperling said. “The impor-tant thing is that you’re very consis-tent in scoring high. I think everyone there at UF can be really proud.”
Other ranked Florida schools 
include Florida Atlantic University - Boca Raton at No. 24, University of Miami at No. 61, Florida State University at No. 68, University of South Florida at No. 72 and Univer-sity of Central Florida at No. 82.
UF Student Health Care Center  
spokeswoman Catherine Seemann said the center works hard to pro-vide resources. She said the SHCC follows the Trojan report card and ﬁ  lls out its survey every year.
“We make sure we have a collab-
orative campus effort to inform stu-dents about as many sexual health prevention and treatment services as possible,” Seemann said.
Kylie Lacusky, president of UF’s 
branch of Vox: Voices for Planned Parenthood, blamed the drop in the rankings on poor sexual education in Florida schools.
“There’s a lot of ignorance in our 
age group about sexual health, but it isn’t really our fault,” the 20-year-old UF history junior said. “Florida teenagers are entering adulthood without any practical knowledge of their own anatomy or bodily func-tions.”
UF goes down on sexual health list“No matter how fast 
someone is texting,

Concerns for building muscle can lead to unforeseen body 
image issues in young men.
According to an 11-year survey research project conducted 
by JAMA Pediatrics and published this month, an increased 
amount of young men suffer from body image issues and eat-ing disorders. Adolescent boys and young males who focus on muscular development and use unhealthy substances to improve their physique are at a higher risk of weight-related disorders,
Roberta Seldman, a UF assistant clinical professor and psy-
chologist, said discussion of body image among men has been a taboo topic in the past.
“There is pressure within our society for males to be mus-cle-bound and physically fit with ripped abs,” said Seldman, coordinator of UF’s eating disorders program.
She said the media casts images of the perfect physical man 
rather than focusing on deeper relationships and connections.
Weight-related disorders are less likely to be identified in 
men, according to the study, because society is more condi-tioned to associate the disorders with women. 
Ashley Pleie, a 21-year-old UF nursing senior and personal 
trainer at Southwest Recreation Center, said her male clients often suffer from body image issues and seek her help. Pleie said most of her clients’ body issues stem from childhood.  
“They used to get bullied for being heavier in school or 
want to reach the fitness level they were at when in high school,” she said.
Michael Fleurinvil, 19-year-old UF finance sophomore, 
said he sometimes feels pressured to be physically fit like the images portrayed on television.
“When you constantly see lean, fit, athletic men on TV, you 
consider that the norm,” he said.
Fleurinvil said advertisements often show the fit guy get-
ting the girl, and it makes young men feel like they have to be of a certain physical stature in order to get girls.
“I’ve gotten to the point where it’s more of a lifestyle 
change,” he said. “I focus on eating healthier and working out, rather than being a certain weight.”Muscle-building men concerned about body image, study shows  
“There is pressure within our society for 
males to be muscle-bound and physically fit

In lieu of vibrant leaf colors, 
Gainesville residents can em-
brace fall colors with the “Fall in Love with a Shelter Animal” offer from Alachua County Animal Services.
Until the end of November, 
all cats and dogs with autumn colors — red, gold, brown or orange — in their coats are up for adoption at reduced prices.
Cats are available for $10, 
and dogs are available for $15. All animals are examined, vac-cinated and spayed or neu-tered before adoption.
Jane Grantman, the Alach-
ua County shelter supervisor, said the shelter tries to come up with fun ways to get the word out and encourage peo-ple to adopt.
“We’re trying to find cre-
ative ways for people to think of us when they think of adop-tion,” she said.
About half of the animals 
at the shelter now are fall-col-ored, Grantman said. She said she hopes the offer will give people incentive to consider the shelter for pets.
Lindsey Eldridge, a 20-
year-old UF exercise physiol-ogy junior, called the special “absolutely adorable.” 
“I think taking some of the 
financial burden out of the equation would get a lot more people to adopt,” she said.Fall-colored pets

Gainesville Police arrested 
more than a dozen people after 
busting a party early Monday at a building undergoing renova-tions.
Officers arrested John L. 
Drake, Mustapha O. Elzaatari and Juan C. Mosquera-Guzman — all 18 — and 20-year-old Thomas Raymond Swanson, along with 10 others, some minors and some adults. The adults were arrested on felony charges of criminal mischief and burglary, said GPD spokesman Officer Ben Tobias.
At about 1 a.m., officers re-
sponded to the Oak Park Execu-tive Suites at 2002 NW 13th St., and found an unlocked door, To-bias said. Several of the partygo-ers were still hiding after the of-ficers made themselves known.
On the third floor, officers 
discovered a makeshift bar and dance floor along with a stereo and disco ball, Tobias said. They also spotted snacks and alcohol.
The property manager arrived at the building. He verified to po-lice that the partiers caused about $3,000 of damages to the build-ing, Tobias said.
Officers took the four adults to 
the Alachua County Jail, where they were released Monday after-noon on their own recognizance. The minors were taken to the Ju-venile Assessment Center.

crease in paid internships reported in the 
survey.
“Interns are valuable and do make a lot 
of positive contributions to a company,” Fournier said. “I think employers are just starting to see that.”
Forty-one percent of organizations re-
ported finding interns through on-campus recruitment, according to the survey. 
Internships give people hands-on expe-
rience and the option to test the waters in the areas they’re interested in, said Joshua Minchin, a UF public relations senior.
“I think they give you an accurate rep-
resentation of the real world,” the 21-year-old said.
Minchin interned at Southern Legal 
Counsel in the summer and said a lot of the good competitive internships fill up early. Many students will start applying to internships months before the deadlines.
“The perception is that internships 
can help you get ahead,” he said. “You’re showing your potential employer that you’re competent and that you’re good at what you do.”InTERn , from page 1 “You’re showing your potential

Two UF students are seek-
ing to end slavery one brush-
stroke at a time.
Free Dove Market, at 
freedovemarket.com, is an online art store that sells do-nated artwork and gives 100 percent of its sales to Love UnVeiled, a ministry that res-cues women from slavery and provides long-term care.
Suzy Schrimsher, a 20-
year-old family, youth and community sciences junior, and Melissa Dukes, a 20-year-old public relations junior, founded Free Dove in March 2013 and have donated about $1,500 from sales.
The artwork they sell rang-
es from $10 knitted headbands  to $200 canvas paintings and has been submitted by art-ists of various ages, genders  and skill levels. However, most of the pieces contributed have come from UF students, Schrimsher said. 
Some UF students are also 
purchasing the pieces fea-tured on the site, like Ashley Kobza, a 20-year-old public relations junior, who said she likes buying items from Free Dove because human traf-ﬁ  cking is an issue close to her heart.
“It’s cool to be able to pur-
chase something that can go on my wall, but also some-thing that’s also going to a mission that I am extremely passionate about,” Kobza said.
Schrimsher and Dukes, 
who are sisters of Kappa Delta sorority at UF, said they ﬁ  rst became passionate about ﬁ  ghting human trafﬁ  cking af-ter they attended a Christian conference and heard about how prevalent this issue is overseas as well as in the U.S.
“We were both heartbro-
ken about it,” Dukes said. “We knew we wanted to do something, but we didn’t know what we could do that was more permanent and long-lasting, so Suzy came up with the idea of starting a website with art on it.”

With ﬁ  nal exam dates approach-
ing, students might want to check 
the time before checking out the Starbucks menu.
According to a recent article, 
“The best time for your coffee” by Steven Miller, people using coffee to raise their alertness may be using it at the wrong time of the day.
Chronopharmacology, which 
studies how biological rhythms and drugs interact, showed cortisol pro-duction in the body is directly tied to a person’s level of alertness and reaches its peak between the hours of 8 and 9 a.m., noon and 1 p.m., and 5:30 and 6:30 p.m. 
Any caffeine consumption dur-
ing these hours wouldn’t increase alertness levels and could interrupt the person’s circadian rhythm. 
Caryn Barry, a 19-year-old UF 
business administration junior and a barista at Pascal’s Coffeehouse, said the morning rush is usually between 9 and 10 a.m., which the article says is after cortisol levels begin reced-ing.Barry said she has noticed people 
usually order the tallest size they have, but it’s difﬁ  cult to judge if peo-ple are ordering for taste or caffeine.
Connor Grill, a 19-year-old UF 
political science freshman, said he has a cup of coffee every day at around 6 p.m., but he doesn’t do it for the taste.
“I would rather have hot choco-
late,” he said. “But that doesn’t make me focus as much.”
Grill said he only orders cof-
fee with cream and sugar, not any blended or iced drinks.
To kickstart the circadian rhythm 
in the morning, Miller also suggest-ed driving to work with sunglasses off. Coffee time not any time, article says“It’s cool to be able 
to purchase something 
that can go on my wall, 
but also something 
that’s also going to 
a mission that I am 
extremely passionate 
about.”

you drink coffee? How you can help 
the devastated 
Philippines
Typhoon Haiyan hit the Philippines Friday, and details 
continue to emerge about the storm’s size and how much relief is needed.
According to NBC World News, “Typhoon Haiyan ‘affect-
ed’ a total of 9.5 million people across the Philippines — and 
displaced at least 600,000 — when it slammed into the coun-try on Friday, according to the UN’s Ofﬁ  ce for the Coordina-tion of Humanitarian Affairs.”
Typhoon Haiyan could be the strongest storm on record. Al-
though storms that powerful — in the Category 4 and Category 
5 range — are common in the eastern Paciﬁ  c this time of year, according to NPR, and it’s rare they reach their peak strength on land. 
“As it approached one large island in the Philippines, the 
storm pushed up into a broad bay. That created a 13-foot storm surge that caused widespread devastation at the head of that bay, in the city of Tacloban,” NPR reporter Richard Harris wrote. “Mountains also wring rainwater out of storms like these. And then there’s the wind. ‘So we had a triple whammy, of surge, very high winds and strong rainfall,’ (climate scientist Kerry) Emanuel says.”
According to CBS New York, “Large areas along the coast 
had been transformed into twisted piles of debris, blocking roads and trapping decomposing bodies underneath. Ships were tossed inland, cars and trucks swept out to sea and bridges and ports washed away.”
Photos and reports from the Philippines have revealed the 
harrowing stories of those killed by the typhoon and the thou-sands of survivors who lost their homes, possessions, and fami-lies and friends. Those left in the aftermath are in desperate need of clean water, food, shelter and medical attention. 
Though the tragedy is countries away, members of the UF 
community can — and should — help. 
You can donate money to the Philippine Red Cross directly 
at redcross.org.ph/donate. 
According to CBS, “UNICEF is taking donations to help pro-
vide children with shelter, clean water, nutrition and vaccines.” You can help UNICEF at unicef.org/support. 
“World Food Programme, a United Nations organization, 
said it will send more than 40 tons of high energy biscuits and work with the Filipino government to help with logistics and emergency communications systems,” CBS also reported. Do-nate at wfpusa.org or by texting “AID” to 27722 to instantly donate $10. Other organizations providing aid to people in the Philippines include the International Rescue Committee, Catho-lic Relief Services, World Vision, Habitat for Humanity, National Alliance for Filipino Concerns, The American Jewish Joint Dis-tribution Committee and many more. 
Any donation counts. We leave you with some lines from 
William Shakespeare’s “Merchant of Venice:”
“How far that little candle throws his beams!So shines a good deed in a naughty world.”Social media is constantly painted as a detriment to 
the individual and culture at large. 
But every once in awhile, a project comes along 
that proves the platforms themselves are not inherently problematic. 
Such a project recently emerged from Chicago and has 
received attention from New York Magazine and The At-lantic.
The usual approach to relationships is one of privacy. 
The little acts of kindness, the annoyances and the squab-bles go unmentioned to those outside the couple — thank God. In a bold move that totally shatters that privacy con-struct, Claire Meyer and Alan Linic are posting every ﬁ  ght they have on Twitter. While the social media generation documents so many trivialities — from outﬁ  ts of the day to plates and plates of mediocre food — these two manage to make over-sharing intimate.
This Chicago couple met eight months ago and moved 
in together in September. Knowing other 20-somethings need a few more role models of modern love, they opened a joint Twitter account where they post succinct descriptions of their arguments once they’ve been resolved. @WeFoughtAbout successfully proves that sometimes the little things do cause the big spats. Other real-life couples ﬁ  nally have a relatable relationship that probably makes them feel a little less crazy thanks to this inventive use of social media.
Linic and Meyer’s account reads as a genuine log of a 
couple navigating new territory together and all the hic-cups one may or may not expect. Some seem trivial, like, “I asked Alan to delete Bejeweled.” Some sound pretty familiar, like, “Alan forgot a decision we made and got mad at me for ‘not telling him about it.’” A few are per-sonal and insightful, like, “Claire tried to comfort me and I wouldn’t let her.”
The beauty of this project is the speciﬁ  city of each post. 
The couple promises they don’t leave out boring ﬁ  ghts, and they don’t try to start them either. Because they post prompt-ly after resolution, they give fol-lowers a real-time representation of the frequency and intensity of their spats. And you know what? They seem to happen a lot, some-times multiple times in a day. But because of their honesty, 
that doesn’t feel like a bad thing. It’s refreshing to have a role model other than those from chick ﬂ  icks and that one wedding-movie plot that just keeps getting recycled.
In the movies, whirlwind romances are a staple, but 
these two are a unique matchup that somehow still rep-resents the everyman and woman. Their arguments aren’t sparked by grandiose, thematic events and are not pep-pered with incendiary one-liners. They start over ﬂ  irty waitresses and baby carrots.
Not one to be left out, Facebook is home to its fair share 
of exposé accounts, too. There are a myriad of portrait pages spanning cities around the world. The most famous seems to be “Humans of New York,” which posts pictures of people living their lives captioned with something im-pactful they tell the photographer. Every post is a cyber-window into the life of a regular Joe, whether their input is grave or lighthearted.
Accounts such as this produced in Paris, Tehran, Co-
penhagen and other cities offer insight into the lifestyles and turmoil in other parts of the world that would other-wise be inaccessible. 
Social media has manifested some negative consequenc-
es in some users, but not all of them are selﬁ  e-addicted narcissists. These websites offer people a megaphone for causes that would otherwise not receive one — like rela-tionship clarity and global-yet-personal insight.

Response to Hillary Clinton guest column
The author of the column does not re-
alize that those of us “ready for Hillary” 
are not mindless supporters of the politi-cal class, but rather citizens simply excited to support the possible campaign of one of the most qualiﬁ  ed and groundbreak-ing potential candidates this country has seen. 
The fact that Clinton is a member of a 
politically inﬂ  uential family is not a phe-nomenon limited to the Democratic Party, nor is it something new in American poli-tics. 
The writer suggested that Clinton’s 
budding candidacy says that there is no internal debate in the Democratic Party.
However, the absence of all out intra-party warfare — as seen in the Republi-can Party — does not mean that we in the Democratic Party are apathetic to the is-sues.

Letter to the Editor
Last week, Virginia, New Jersey 
and New York City had high-proﬁ  le elections that garnered 
national attention. For the ﬁ  rst time in more than 20 years, New York City has a Democratic mayor. Virginia — one of the most purple of states in the country — ended its bitter guberna-torial election when Democrat Terry McAuliffe won the governorship. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie retained his ofﬁ  ce and swiftly defeated his opponent. 
But instead of talking about what these politi-
cians will do for their cities or states or what issues they campaigned on, everyone is transﬁ  xed on how these election results will affect the 2016 presiden-tial election.
Did Christie seem presidential in this victory 
speech? Is his proactive personality going to win him support in the Iowa Straw Poll? If Virginia now has a Democrat for governor-elect, is a Demo-cratic president a sureﬁ  re conclusion?    
At ﬁ  rst this seems like utter nonsense. Why are 
we looking three years down the road when we have things to worry about presently? And in addi-tion to this, should we be more concerned election-wise about the 2014 midterm elections?
The reason everybody is in “2016 election mode” 
is because nothing is happening in Washington. We already know the Obamacare rollout was a disaster — that’s old news. Determining whether the Af-fordable Care Act will accrue new enrollees when the website is ﬁ  xed is just outright speculation. We know the chief executive is incapable of implement-ing laws and keeping campaign promises. 
And we know Congress cannot get things done, 
either. Immigration reform? Dead. Background checks? Dead. Tax reform? Because nobody seems to be interested in ﬁ  xing the tax code, it’s safe to say that it looks dead. 
But hey, at least we can talk about how Sen. Rand Paul is now “damaged goods” after the plagiarism accusations. Why is this story popular now? Well for one, nothing else is getting done in the country. More importantly, it will have “implications” for the upcoming presi-dential race. The truth is, though this story is talked about now ad nauseam, in a few years’ time this story will be a distant memory — even though it has 
current “direct implications” on Paul’s presidential run. 
Another reason we talk about 2016 is because 
power change in Congress is not likely to happen in 2014. The House of Representatives will still be in Republican control, even though Democrats only need to net 17 seats to regain the majority. House seats are too safe, and the politicians are too entrenched in their districts. Republicans will face difﬁ  culty in taking over the Senate, especially when their party leader is engaged in a primary ﬁ  ght. 
But instead of talking about the status quo be-
ing upheld in the 2014 elections, we can talk about whether Sen. Ted Cruz will run for president. 
By looking too far out into the future, we lose 
track of the present. This could be the reason so many issues are not being addressed. Immigration reform? We can do that next year when it is more politically palpable. Tax reform? When we get a majority in the Congress, we should be able to vote on that. 
And the crazy thing is, while we are looking for 
a new executive, we still have a current executive. Perhaps this is wide-eyed optimism, but things can still be done. We can seize the time, seize the mo-ment and get things done that will positively affect the country. Forget the 2016 elections, and focus on getting things done now. 
But seriously, will Hillary run?Michael Beato is a UF economics sophomore. His 
column runs on Tuesdays.
We have work to do before 2016Column
There is a bill mov-
ing through the Florida legisla-
ture that would allow honorably discharged military veterans to pay in-state tuition. For out-of-state military veterans applying to public universities and colleges in Florida, the bill would waive the one-year standard to establish residency.
Military veterans have put 
their lives on the line to protect the freedoms we enjoy every day. Veterans put the country before themselves as they served to en-sure our freedoms would never be taken away. For this reason, Florida should pass the bill that would give military veterans in-state tuition. 
In the state university system, 
there are about 2,400 non-resident veterans. 
The bill would not impact the 
admissions process, but simply help veterans with the ﬁ  nancial burden of paying for college.
The military provides service-
men and women a set of values including dedication, integrity, duty and re-spect. U.S. vets have proven through their service that they have the tools necessary to 
be successful. As they put their lives on the line, vets do not only ﬁ  ght for the state in which they have residency, but  for the entire nation. 
Twenty-six states have already 
waived the residency waiting time for veterans’ tuition purpos-es. Currently in Florida, out-of-state vets are paying close to three times the in-state tuition cost. 
Today, Student Government 
and the Collegiate Veterans So-ciety are hosting an event in sup-port of in-state tuition for all mili-tary veterans in Pugh Hall at 6:30 p.m. The event will feature out-of-state veterans sharing how the passage of this bill would impact them personally. 
The bill is being sponsored by 
Sen. Latvala and Rep. Peters.

Freshman honored
Gators women’s basketball forward Ronni Williams 
was named Southeastern Conference Freshman of the Week, the league announced Monday.Coach Billy Donovan and the UF men’s basketball team play tonight at Wisconsin. Read the story on page 16. It started with a tweet. 
  A snapshot of a barely ﬁ  lled student section 10 minutes 
before kickoff turned into a national story. Outlets such as 
USA Today and Yahoo! Sports picked up the tweet, and the 
perception was created that Florida’s students would rather stay home than attend their school’s homecoming football game. 
  ESPN’s Scott Van Pelt said Monday on his nationally syn-
dicated radio show that the Gators played in a half-ﬁ  lled sta-dium.
  By the time Vanderbilt drilled a 31-yard ﬁ  eld goal with 7:56 
remaining in the ﬁ  rst quarter on its opening drive, the student section on the east side of Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n stadium was three-fourths full and still growing. 
  Before kickoff, social media sounded the apathy alarm and 
turned coach Will Muschamp’s hot seat even hotter. 
  Unfortunately, it may be more than losses that spark chang-es in Florida’s football program. I call it a deceptive perception.
  These rushes to judgment began in 
the dog days of summer. 
  Antonio Morrison immediately be-
came news following his second arrest of the summer, in which he allegedly barked at a police dog. The Daily Mail, a tabloid newspaper in the United Kingdom, ran an online story about 
the incident. Turns out the sophomore shouldn’t have been ar-rested at all, according to the state of Florida.
  Damage already done.   How about the suspension for Jay-nard Bostwick that never 
was? Several publications reported the freshman defensive tackle had been suspended along with four other Gators for the season opener against Toledo on Aug. 31. Muschamp spent Friday night and Saturday morning clearing up confusion with Bostwick’s family. Not something a coach expects to deal with prior to a season opener.
  Remember the debut of Tyler Murphy? Through three 
games, he looked like he could cure cancer, solve world hunger and save a Florida offense decimated by injuries. 
  Tim Tebow, the closest person to a religious deity in 
Gainesville, couldn’t even do that.
  Fast forward to Saturday against Vanderbilt when Florida 
ran an option to the short side of the ﬁ  eld on ﬁ  rst-and-goal from the 1-yard line. It was a questionable call that made The Swamp have a conniption. Even more fury surrounded Brent Pease, who has come under ﬁ  re for Florida’s poor offensive showing much of the season. 
  What about Muschamp not being capable of coaching this 
team? That might be the most misconstrued perception of all.   ADAM LICHTENSTEIN
 Alligator Staff Writer @alichtenstein24
  The hits keep coming for the Gators.  Sophomore linebacker Antonio Mor-
rison will miss the rest of Florida’s season with a torn meniscus, coach Will Mus-champ announced Monday. 
  “Very disappointed for him,” the third-
year coach said.
  Morrison has started Florida’s (4-5, 3-4 
Southeastern Conference) last seven games at Mike linebacker and leads the team with 56 tackles. However, the sophomore has struggled to penetrate opponents’ offen-sive lines, notching only one tackle for a loss and no sacks.
  Muschamp said redshirt junior Michael 
Taylor will start at Mike linebacker in place of Morrison, moving from the Will posi-tion. Freshman Jarrad Davis will take over for Taylor at Will linebacker.
  Taylor is second on the team with 53 
tackles, including 3.5 for loss, and Davis has drawn praise from the coaching staff for his work on special teams.
  “Jarrad Davis is a guy that we’ve been 
very pleased with,” Muschamp said. “He’s a young player that’s going to be a very good player here. He’s played outstand-ing on special teams, and when he’s had his opportunities at linebacker, he’s played well.”
  Muschamp also mentioned a possibil-
ity for more playing time for freshman linebacker Alex Anzalone, who came to Florida as a ﬁ  ve-star recruit, according to Rivals.com.
  Morrison and the rest of the defense have 
struggled to stop the run in recent weeks, surrendering an average of 162.3 yards per game during the past three contests. 
  “We’ve done some nice things at times,” 
Muschamp said, “but not consistent enough to be able to stop the run consistently, espe-cially when we’ve needed to in critical situ-ations.”
  In his last game of the season, the sopho-
more linebacker led UF with 10 tackles and picked up his sole tackle behind the line.

 Overreactions to struggles of Florida football team unwarranted 
Adam Pincus

 Alligator Staff Writer @phillip_heilman
   With his team mired in a four-game los-
ing streak and his own production lagging, 
Tyler Murphy could beneﬁ  t from added time on the practice ﬁ  eld.
  Unfortunately for Florida’s redshirt ju-
nior quarterback, a nagging shoulder in-jury will prevent that from happening.
  Murphy ﬁ  rst suffered a sprained AC 
joint in his throwing shoulder during a loss to LSU on Oct. 12 and has dealt with lingering effects ever since. His status for Florida’s game against No. 10 South Caro-lina on Saturday at 7 p.m. remains uncer-tain.
  “It’s just frustrating 
being banged up a little bit and having to sit out and try to get healthy,” said Murphy, who is not expected to return to practice until Wednes-day. “I’m just going to live in the training room 
and get healthy and try to get back out there as soon as possible.”
  Murphy’s tepid response to questions 
about his injury leaves the situation un-clear. However, when asked if he would be able to play if the game against South Carolina were on Monday, he admitted the answer was “most likely not.”
  “I’m not 100 percent sure,” Murphy 
said. “It’s more of a day-to-day thing. I’m just trying to get healthy so I can get back  Murphy still

Ronni Williams posts up during Florida’s win against 
North Florida on Sunday in the O’Connell Center.
women’S bASKetbALL
GORDON STREISAND
Alligator Writer @GordonStreisand
It was a tale of two victories. 
Although Florida won both of its games 
this weekend in the O’Connell Center, there was a difference between the open-ing game against Bethune-Cookman and Sunday’s game against North Florida. 
On Friday, the Gators flexed their mus-
cle on both ends of the floor in a convincing 93-65 win against Bethune-Cookman. The Gators outrebounded the Wildcats 41-34, with 17 rebounds coming from freshman Ronni Williams, who broke the program record for rebounds in a debut. 
“I was just excited to be out there,” Wil-
liams said. “I thought I did pretty good. Grabbed rebounds, scored … but mainly, grabbed rebounds.”
With sophomore forward Christin Mer-
cer sidelined with an ankle injury, UF had only eight players dressed for both games. 
The Gators easily overcame the loss, as 
five players scored in double digits against UNF and seven scored in double figures against Bethune-Cookman. 
“Fantastic team effort,” coach Amanda 
Butler said after the game against Bethune-Cookman. “You always feel good as a team when you feel like everyone contributed big minutes, big plays, knocking down free throws … those sort of things that we know are going to be so crucial for us.”
Sunday, Florida seemingly picked up 
where it left off. 
The Gators opened the game against the 
Ospreys with a 10-0 run. Senior Lily Svete made her first four shots from behind the arc, and Florida was up 17 points in fewer than eight minutes into the game. 
However, Florida’s defense was porous 
and allowed UNF to pull within three early in the second half. 
“I thought (UNF) challenged us in 
the paint a lot differently than we were challenged on Friday night,” Butler said. “Frankly, we didn’t handle it very well. To be out-rebounded on your home floor is something that’s definitely caught our at-tention. Unfortunately, the noticeable dif-ferences (in our gameplay) were probably in the negative column.
“Consistently, we just didn’t play the 
defensive game we needed to. There were too many spikes, too much up and down. You saw some great plays with turnovers, but there wasn’t a consistent level of defen-sive pride in the way that we played.”Florida was outrebounded 43-30 by a 
UNF team that lost by 40 points to Miami two days earlier. 
The stark contrast in rebounding can be 
attributed to Williams’ absence. The fresh-man got into foul trouble against UNF. Compared to Friday’s game, during which she posted 15 points, 17 rebounds and five blocks in 29 minutes, Williams put up only four points, five rebounds and three blocks in 17 minutes before fouling out late in the game on Sunday.
Fortunately for Florida, junior Kayla 
Lewis rose to the occasion, recording nine rebounds and five steals while also chip-ping in 16 points in the 88-77 win. 
“I think everybody can contribute,” 
Lewis said. “It’s going to be game by game, not saying that you’re going to play bad one game and then not the next. The op-portunity was there.”
Butler is pleased with the balance her 
team has shown to start the season. How-ever, the Gators still have plenty of room for improvement.
“The bright side is feeling like you 
played really, really poorly and still being able to win,” she said. “Overall, we’ve got a lot of work to do.”
Gators enjoy strong opening weekend of playThere may be changes made after 
the season, but going on a third head 
coach in ﬁ  ve seasons would put Flori-da’s recruiting on life support.
  Truth is, center Jon Harrison and 
right guard Jon Halapio are the only preseason starters still playing along the offensive line. Expecting Murphy, a solid, yet unproven, talent to suddenly turn the season around isn’t fair.
  Losing starting quarterback Jeff 
Driskel and NFL-bound defensive line-man Dominique Easley to season-end-ing injuries devastated the team’s talent level and its psyche. Pease may not turn out to be the guru this offense needs, but he hasn’t had a healthy enough team to prove otherwise.   A 4-5 record isn’t acceptable, but 
with as many injuries as the Gators have had, it’s understandable.
  Snap judgments have made the 
Gators a team with troublemakers off the ﬁ  eld, a team with an incompetent coaching staff and a team whose fans were so fed up that they wouldn’t show up to their homecoming game.
  In the eyes of many, each loss turns 
these deceptive perceptions into disap-pointing realities. 
Needing two wins against No. 10 
South Carolina, Georgia Southern and No. 2 Florida State, Florida may miss out on its ﬁ  rst bowl game since 1990 and its ﬁ  rst losing season since 1979.  
When watching the remaining three 
regular season games, remember one thing: Everything isn’t always what it seems. TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 12, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 15

Tyler Murphy (3) attempts to scramble during Florida’s 34-17 loss to Vanderbilt on 
Saturday in Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium. The redshirt junior has a sprained shoulder.
Gators last in SEC in total offense
out there and I can try to contrib-
ute to help out this team.”
  Much like the rest of the team, 
Murphy has struggled during Florida’s four-game slide toward the bottom of the Southeastern Conference Eastern Division. 
  After completing 72.2 percent 
of his passes with ﬁ  ve touch-downs and just one intercep-tion during his ﬁ  rst three games, Murphy has seen his production regress since Florida beat Arkan-sas on Oct. 5. 
  Murphy completed just 50.6 
percent of his passes and threw no touchdowns in losses to LSU, Missouri and Georgia. Against Vanderbilt on Saturday, he threw for a career-high 305 yards on 30-of-46 passing but tossed three deﬂ  ating interceptions that led to 21 points for the Commo-dores. He also lost a fumble with the Gators looking for points of their own prior to halftime.
  “You can’t just turn over the 
football,” coach Will Muschamp said. “You spot a football team — any team — on the 4, twice on the 10 and on the 20-yard line, it’s a hard time. You can’t turn the ball over.”
  Added Murphy: “Turning 
the ball over — especially inter-ceptions — it makes it tough to sleep at night.”
  At one point during the 
game, redshirt freshman Sky-ler Mornhinweg — who would likely start in Murphy’s place if he were unable to go this week-end — began warming up on the sideline in case he was needed.
  Not unlike its quarterback, 
Florida’s offense is clearly labor-ing. 
  UF is last in the conference 
in total offense (335.7 yards per game) and 13th in scoring offense (20.6 points per game). Nation-ally, the Gators rank 112th and tied for 106th in those respective categories.
  “We need to learn to over-
come our circumstances, and that’s something we have a hard time doing as far as a slow start, a turnover and overcome those situations,” Muschamp said. “It’s my job to get it right, and that’s what we’re working on.”

Florida missing seven starters 
  Morrison drew attention before the season 
began, getting arrested twice during the sum-
mer.
  The ﬁ  rst arrest came after Morrison punched 
a bouncer, according to a Gainesville Police re-port. He was charged with simple battery and received a deferred prosecution.
  The second arrest came ﬁ  ve weeks later af-
ter Morrison barked at a police dog, according to an Alachua County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce report. That charge was later dropped.
  Muschamp suspended the sophomore line-
backer for the entirety of fall camp and the Gators’ ﬁ  rst game of the season, but Morrison returned for Florida’s game against Miami on Sept. 7.
  “I learned a lot. I took responsibility for ev-
erything,” Morrison said on Aug. 28. “Every-thing I took responsibility for. I just learned a lot from the whole situation as a person.
  “I already love the game. But the game tak-
en away from me, that hurt.”  Morrison joins a long list of Gators who 
have had football taken away from them this season.
  Ten Florida players, including seven start-
ers, have suffered sea-son-ending injuries.
  Quarterback Jeff 
Driskel (fractured ﬁ  bu-
la), running back Matt Jones (torn meniscus), wide receiver Andre Debose (torn ACL), offen-sive tackle Chaz Green (torn labrum), offensive tackle Tyler Moore (fractured elbow), defen-sive tackle Dominique Easley (torn ACL), line-backer Jeremi Powell (torn ACL), linebacker Matt Rolin (torn ACL) and defensive back Nick Washington (shoulder) all suffered season-ending injuries.
  “It’s deﬁ  nitely discouraging, but we don’t 
look to use that as an excuse,” quarterback Ty-ler Murphy said. 
“It’s unfortunate that we’ve had so many 
guys go down, but it’s an opportunity for some of the other guys and the younger guys to step up and play and get their feet wet.”  MORRISON , from page 13ADAM , from page 13Injuries have plagued UF

Billy Donovan was irritated 
following Florida’s season-open-
ing victory against North Florida.
He was unhappy about giving up nine three-pointers, he was 
confused as to how the Ospreys finished the first half on an 11-0 run, and he questioned his team’s basketball IQ in terms of knowing where to be on defense.
But if there is one thing Dono-van could change before tonight’s matchup against No. 20 Wiscon-sin (1-0) at 9 p.m. in Madison, Wisc., it is No. 11 Florida’s (1-0) attitude on the court.
After Friday night’s 77-69 win, 
which was the Gators’ small-est margin of victory in a season opener since 2001, Donovan said his team did not show the inten-sity or determination needed to be ranked.
“One thing that gets under my 
skin is this look of entitlement, (like) everything is supposed to go my way, and if it doesn’t, I get de-flated,” Donovan said. “(Where’s) our resiliency, our fight, our grit? Our team didn’t show remotely close to the grit that North Florida showed; so maybe our guys can learn something from them.”
When the Badgers visited the 
O’Connell Center last season, the Gators raced out of the gates with a 9-0 run and never relinquished the lead. The 74-56 victory was Florida’s second largest margin of victory against a Big Ten oppo-nent under Donovan.
However, guard Michael Fra-
zier II said this year’s squad has a lot to learn from past teams. He said the Gators need to make adjustments in order to stand a chance Tuesday night.
“We talked about when we 
played them last year and our energy level, our focus,” Frazier said. “We were on edge, and the coaches have been talking about that. We don’t have that same edge in practice that we did a year ago when we played these guys. So, they’ve really been talking about how we’re going to have to be on edge during the game, because if we relax for a second, then threes go up.”
Wisconsin’s 33 percent shoot-ing from behind the arc was tied for 211th in the nation last year, but it sank 11 of 23 three-pointers in a 86-75 victory over St. John’s on Nov. 8.
Florida has given up a total of 
22 threes this season, including in its exhibition against Florida Southern. 
Including last year’s exhibi-
tion against Nebraska-Kearney, the Gators gave up just one more three in five games last season than they have in two games so far this year.
“If we play that way like we 
did on Friday, we have no shot to win the game,” Donovan said.
Donovan said the Gators were 
light years away from being a ranked team. Following Friday night’s game, he increased the in-tensity of practices to get the team in the right mindset for its first top-20 matchup of the season.
Frazier said the focus has been 
on fixing the broken defense and the broken attitude, both of which he said will improve vastly when Florida takes the floor of the Kohl Center tonight.
“Instead of just saying that 
it’s going to happen, we actually went out there and approached it as if it was our last practice,” Fra-zier said. 
“Every possession is a cham-
pionship possession. That’s what the coaches really have been talk-ing about. Just playing every possession like it’s our last and having that focus and edge every play.”
