Pirates, princesses and patrol cars will set the 
scene in Gainesville tonight.
Police ofﬁ  cers and towing companies will be 
on high alert for drunk drivers and unsafe activ-
ity today.
The UF Police Department plans to increase 
the number of patrol cars around campus to pro-tect the roadways, said Maj. Brad Barber, UPD spokesman.
“A signiﬁ  cant mistake people make is when 
they feel like they haven’t consumed enough al-cohol to the level of impairment,” Barber said. “If you’re making those kinds of judgments under the inﬂ  uence of alcohol, you’ll rarely be correct.”
He said that ofﬁ  cers will conduct the Hallow-
een Impaired Driving Campaign, including satu-ration patrols through Sunday.
“Any fatality is one too many,” he said.Police hope to reduce the alcohol-related crash-
es, fatalities and injuries that occur in and around the campus community.
“We don’t anticipate a huge uptick in activity,” 
he said. “Ofﬁ  cers will still be conducting scopes on campus and in residence halls.”
Barber said students don’t realize the repercus-
sions of their actions when they drive drunk.
Jeffrey Meldon, a local DUI attorney, said the 
costs and consequences of a DUI case are exten-sive, and the largest cost in the cases is the in-crease in an individual’s insurance.
He said a law in Florida requires an individu-
al convicted of a DUI to carry at least $50,000 of property damage insurance and at least $100,000 of bodily injury liability insurance.
He said individuals can go from paying less 
than $1,000 for their insurance each year to about $3,000 to $4,000 a year. After three years, this University Police

About 200 people packed the Ches-
terﬁ  eld Smith Room in the Fredric G. 
Levin College of Law on Tuesday for the Student Senate meeting to discuss the blackface incident at UF last week.
Several students spoke during the 
public comment section to express their feelings regarding a picture of two Beta Theta Pi brothers who wore blackface makeup at a “rock stars and rappers” themed social last week.
Blackface was often used in 19th 
century theater productions to carica-turize black people. It is seen by many as an offensive practice today.At the meeting, Nailah Summers, 
who is listed on the Department of Student Activities and Involvement’s website as president of the Dream Defenders, spoke against the act and 
those people who said it was not offen-sive.
“We have every 
right to be upset with the people condon-
ing this behavior,” she said. “You have no concept of our history, and if you 
did, you would not be telling us to calm down and get over it.”
Sen. Trimaine Shefﬁ  eld said he felt a sense of commitment to the students who came to the meeting to speak about the incident.
“If you have a connection to the 
black community, based off skin color or sense of identiﬁ  cation, I stand here as a representative for you,” he said.
Justin Hosbey, the ﬁ  rst vice presi-
dent of the Black Graduate Student Organization, said that regardless of whether people were offended, it was a racist incident. Hosbey and the sec-ond vice president of the organiza-tion, Justin Dunnavant, said they had ﬁ  ve recommendations that they hope to see accomplished at the university. One of these recommendations was an ofﬁ  cial statement describing the event and the university’s response to it. They also requested a formal apology

Almost a year after a series of 
Occupy Gainesville arrests landed 
dozens of protesters in jail, occupi-ers got a chance to challenge the charges.
Occupy Gainesville members 
went before a three-judge panel Tuesday for a court hearing at the Alachua County Courthouse.
The judges will make a decision 
after attorneys from both sides sub-mit their final paperwork Nov. 13.
Since the 2011 incidents on Bo 
Diddley Community Plaza, Oct. 14, Oct. 27 and Nov. 12, protest-ers fought to throw out their tres-passing charges, saying the arrests violated their First Amendment rights.
Geoffrey Mason, an attorney 
with Schackow, Mercadante & Ed-wards, said he represented 28 pro-testers. 
Attorneys Bill Salmon and Jen-
nifer Zedalis represented one per -
son each, while Daniel Nee, as well as several other attorneys, repre-sented the state and city.
All public Gainesville parks, in-
cluding Bo Diddley Plaza, are open between 6 a.m. and 11:30 p.m. un-less otherwise posted, according to a Gainesville ordinance. Anyone caught on public park grounds when it is closed will be arrested.
The defense argued the word-
ing in the city ordinance was “too vague and overbroad.”
Zedalis argued the ordinance 
is essentially “a loitering statute” — not a trespassing law — adding that the ordinance could infringe on First Amendment rights.
Nee countered, saying the or -
dinance is a park-hours law that is meant to be enforced.
He said there are approximately 
70 parks managed by the city, in-cluding the plaza, which is used by a multitude of people for various reasons.

Trick-or-treating isn’t the only 
way to get candy today. Biking, bus-
ing, walking or carpooling to and from campus can earn UF commu-nity members treats for their trans-portation choices.
Workers will give candy to peo-
ple taking part in the fifth annual One Less Car Day, a campuswide effort designed to promote alterna-tive methods of commuting, said Michael Amish, program assistant for UF’s Office of Sustainability.
“It’s a day you pledge to not use a 
single-occupancy vehicle,” he said.The impact is not limited to re-
ducing carbon dioxide emissions, said Leslie Thiele, director of sus-tainability studies at UF.
One Less Car Day is an activity 
in which people learn about a pro-gram, realize it’s not as difficult as they thought and, therefore, make a simple adjustment to their lifestyle, he said.
“This could sort of have a snow-
ball effect in their lives,” said Thiele, who likes cycling to work.
It’s important for people to work 
toward solutions instead of being part of the problem, he said.
English freshman Shannen 
Mitchell, 19, said the One Less Car program reinforced her desire to not have a car until she finishes college.
“There are other ways to get 
around than just using a car,” she said.One Less Car Day will be
celebrated campuswide

A Gainesville man was arrested Tuesday 
after he allegedly pulled out a shotgun near 
a local high school during a road rage argu-ment.
Gainesville Police charged Joshua Williams, 
19, of Southwest 49th Place, with possession of a firearm on school property, a third-degree felony, according to a GPD arrest report.
Police were contacted Tuesday regard-
ing the man who confronted a driver with a shotgun directly across from Gainesville High School.
When officers arrived, Williams told them 
that when he turned into a business driveway from Northwest 13th Street, a driver beeped his horn and gave Williams the middle finger.Williams pulled over and 
walked toward the driver, according to the report. 
The two men argued, 
then Williams walked back to his car and grabbed a 12-
gauge shotgun.
“It’s a crazy world,” 
Williams said to the driver, according to the report. “You just can’t go around flipping people off.”
Williams told officers he and the driver 
shook hands moments later.
Police booked Williams into Alachua 
County Jail on Tuesday at 1:24 p.m., where he remained without bond Tuesday night.

Jean Calderwood knows the 
City of Alachua the way some 
people know their families.
She loves to talk about the 
quirks that make her town origi-nal — each light pole on Main Street was adopted and deco-rated, there are horse-friendly public parks and a thriving Hare Krishna community.
The city’s success, as Calder -
wood sees it, stems from a bal-ance among the government, businesses and residents.
She said she’ll bring a fresh, county-inclusive perspective to the County Commission.
She said the county has long-
kept its focus on Gainesville, though there are several other communities to consider. She said she’ll help the county bal-ance the environment with de-velopment and local government with private business.
“We are a good example that 
you can achieve a balance be-tween economic development, protecting natural resources and preserving the historic aspects of your community,” she said. “There’s no reason why we can’t do that in the county.”She also said she’d increase 
funding for rural areas, includ-ing for recreation.
Though Alachua has invested 
in parks, only 20 to 30 percent of the children who use them are from the city. The rest come from surrounding communities like High Springs and Lacrosse, which don’t have the money to build parks.
She also has a lot to say about 
county roads.
“The county has neglected 
responsibility for roads and has put the burden back on the cities to fix roads the county is respon-sible for,” Calderwood said.
Another one of Calderwood’s 
goals is attracting more busi-nesses and people to the area.
Some of Alachua’s newest en-
gines for economic development are major retail distribution cen-ters west of the city such as Wal-mart and Dollar General.
Though the centers produce 
jobs and pay taxes to Alachua County, the City of Alachua faced an uphill battle with the county to let the companies stay.
After a few lawsuits and lots 
of criticism, the city approved the plans for the centers after requiring that the centers leave green areas and brush to act as a buffer to the wilderness.
Calderwood said she tried to 
blend businesses with the area’s natural beauty.
She points to Alachua Prog-
ress Park, a center for startups and biotechnical companies. Near the back of the buildings is a sprawling park with horse trails.
This balance of development 
and nature is similar to what Calderwood would like to see in the county: a blend of local gov-ernment, private businesses and volunteers.
Though she hasn’t worked ex-
tensively with UF, she hopes to nurture a relationship between the university and county gov-ernment.
“We need to harness the value 
of the Gator Nation and combine it with the rest of Alachua Coun-ty,” Calderwood said.

Tonight’s horror movie mar -
athons could replace the exercis-
ing needed to burn off those fun-size candy bars.
Researchers at the University 
of Westminster in the United Kingdom conducted a study in which 10 people watched a selection of scary movies. Re-searchers recorded their heart rates, oxygen intakes and carbon dioxide outputs.
The study found that an av-
erage of about 113 calories — the equivalent of one chocolate bar — are burned during a 90-min-ute thriller. On the top 10 list of calorie-burning films, “The Shin-ing” earned the top spot with 184 calories. Second place went to “Jaws” with 161 calories.
First-year film studies Ph.D. 
candidate and UF professor Pe-ter Gitto said that film can ma-nipulate the viewer into a physi-cal reaction. 
He agreed with the ranking 
“The Shining” received.
“It’s the power of the cin-
ema,” Gitto said.
Cassie Macias, director of 
UF’s Living Well fitness cen-ter, said that although she finds the study interesting, the only proven way to burn calories is to exercise and monitor eating behaviors.
“Everybody’s different, and 
everybody reacts to things dif-ferently ,” Macias said. “There’s some people who can’t handle anything.”
The study’s researchers con-
cluded that movies with surpris-ing scenes often spike viewers’ heart rates and allow adrenaline to flow.
“It’s a lot easier to sit and 
watch a movie than run a mile,” said Chris Boyett, an 18-year-old English freshman.“I’d rather run a mile.”Burn calories from TVSHELBY WEBB

Editor’s note: This is part of a series that 
profiles candidates running for state and local offices.    
It’s a long drive to Hutch’s office.
The two-lane county road near Micanopy is 
lined with ancient oaks that droop with Span-ish moss. A narrow dirt road leads to his office at the Alachua Conservation Trust, which has purchased more than 8,000 acres of Alachua County’s forests, farms and wilderness.
Many of these efforts were spearheaded by 
the trust’s executive director, Robert Hutchin-son, who is known almost exclusively as “Hutch.”
But the Gainesville native hopes to influ-
ence more than land-preserving deals this year by running for the District 3 seat in the Alachua County Commission.
He said he thinks students should vote for 
him due to his progressive stance on drugs, involvement with Innovation Gainesville and commitment to protect the natural areas of Alachua County.
Hutch is familiar with the position, because 
he was elected to the Alachua County Com-mission in 1998. During his time in office, the county merged its dispatch center with other agencies to respond to emergencies faster, built a new sheriff’s headquarters, paid for a new courthouse through a voter-approved sales tax and worked to cut back jail overcrowding.
Part of the prison overcrowding problem, 
as Hutch sees it, is locking up minor drug of-fenders.
“We’re locking up way too many people,” 
Hutch said. “Thirty percent of Florida prison-ers are incarcerated due to substance use or mental health issues. That’s just not right.”
While he acknowledges there is little the 
county can do to decriminalize minor drug use, it can take away the incentive for officers to make busts.
Under current county laws, Hutch said, 
deputies can use the money raised from drug busts to buy new weapons and technology.
Hutch said if he is elected, he would like 
to see a portion of these forfeiture funds go to drug rehabilitation and education. He said he would try to change the laws so the money made from the forfeiture laws would tie in with funding to the Sheriff’s Office.
On one hand, the department would get 
less county funding based on how many sei-zures it makes. On the other hand, forfeitures could fill in budget holes during lean years.
“They will get the same amount of money 
no matter what,” Hutch said, “so they won’t have that extra incentive.”
However, Hutch fully endorses incentives 
to businesses and said he was proud to serve on the board of the Gainesville Chamber of Commerce when Innovation Gainesville be-gan to materialize.
“The philosophy is to stay out of the way of 
entrepreneurs,” he said.
While he’s eager to attract more companies 
and startups to the area, Hutch said he wants growth to be managed in an environmentally responsible way.
If elected, he said, he would try to keep 
development centers, like Florida Innovation Hub at UF and Innovation Square, within Gainesville city limits to make sure the more rural and scenic areas are not developed.After all, he said, he loves to be surrounded 
by nature.

‘Star Wars’ is run 
by Stormpoopers
Nerds everywhere felt a disturbance in the force yester-
day.
George Lucas, whom some may call the supreme 
overlord of movie franchises and others may call a terrible per-son, sold his production company to The Walt Disney Co. for $4.05 billion.
This deal included his Lucasﬁ  lm Ltd. and the “Star Wars” 
ﬁ  lm franchise. Yes, that means there is going to be a seventh “Star Wars” movie.
“It’s now time for me to pass ‘Star Wars’ on to a new genera-
tion of ﬁ  lmmakers,” Lucas said in a statement.
So, Disney is slowly acquiring everything we hold dear, ap-
parently. As a reminder, they bought Pixar Animation Studios in 2006, as well as Marvel Entertainment in 2009.
Robert Iger, Disney’s chief executive, announced that the 
company plans to release “Star Wars VII” in 2015.
“Lucasﬁ  lm reﬂ  ects the extraordinary passion, vision and sto-
rytelling of its founder, George Lucas,” Iger said in a statement.
The business deal probably makes sense, because the ﬁ  lm 
franchise already has a presence in Disney’s theme parks, but something about a large acquisition of wealth makes us uncom-fortable.
Not all of us struggled through our college years living off a 
trust fund, so seeing numbers that large means very little.
What means more, though, is the thought process behind col-
lecting companies like Pokemon.
Disney already owns everything. Well, almost everything —  
basically just the important things.
That company starts socializing and indoctrinating children 
at the beginning of their lives, so it’s important to us as a society. It creates its own TV programming, movies, music, radio pro-grams, accessories, toys, games, decorations, marketing, food and commercial space for all of those — not to mention, multiple theme parks for the company to revel in its own glory.
The sad thing is that we all love Disney . It has created some 
wonderful memories for most of us (and some negative body images for others, but that’s for another day). So, why would it pay so much money for a franchise that should be dead and done? We’re not saying that “Star Wars” is terrible or bad, but Lucas had to have known he made it go downhill more quickly than it needed to.
There’s no need to create more movies simply for the sake of 
making more movies. Plus, was Disney the right choice to sell 
it to?
“Those acquisitions have given Disney more material as 
it seeks to appeal to a broader range of children and families, 
especially teenage boys, a notoriously hard-to-reach audience,” according to an article in the Wall Street Journal.
Too bad it seems like teenage boys are one of the most avail-
able audiences to reach. At least, it seems like so many products are already geared toward males of all ages, so it doesn’t seem like it should be that difﬁ  cult to reach them with more advertis-ing.
Let’s hope that Disney doesn’t end up making it all worse.
I was convinced I hated cheesecake growing up, but I can’t 
quite recall why.
Perhaps it was that odd taste, the strange consistency 
or that this cake-wannabe lacked the icing of its bready cous-in. Regardless, I was not a fan, and there was no swaying that conﬁ  dent 12-year-old from his position.
Oh, how times have changed.I found myself Trojan-horsed a year ago by a friend’s 
freshly prepared pumpkin cheesecake. “Supripri,” as we shall call her, was too well-intentioned to shut down when she approached me with a cheesecake she made just for me.  
I can be stubborn, but I’m a sucker for anything laced 
with pumpkin. Anyone who’s tasted an Einstein Bros Bagels pumpkin mufﬁ  n will understand why .  
Surprisingly , Supripri’s confections wooed my taste buds 
into renegotiating their prior vehemence.
Don’t get me wrong.  I’m not a cheesecake aﬁ  cionado now, but trying some 
changed the game.  The ice around my heart is melting, and now you have to sit through another cheesy analogy.
I issued a warning at the beginning of the semester that I 
was going to be “that guy” — the one who talked about reli-gion.  Sure enough, I’ve talked a lot about Jesus. I apologize if that annoys you.  
We talk about what we love, and Jesus is more than sim-
ply my homeboy.
It’s not my intention to troll, but I suppose it’s unavoid-
able considering there seem to be as many opinions as there are people in this world, and shockingly , this is an opinions column.  
Who would’ve thought that I’d express my opinion?I’m being a smart aleck, but I also want to offer some solu-
tions.  
If your entire day is ruined by reading my opinions, feel 
free to check out the insights of the distinguished gentleman who ﬁ  lls the adjacent space.  
You can also ignore those endangered orange racks alto-
gether on Wednesdays, though my editors might take issue with that.  
I am digressing, though.  Some of you really hate my 
brand of “cheesecake,” and I can’t blame you. You don’t know me, I don’t know you and many people have made some terribly distaste-ful desserts. I’m not trying to leave a bad taste in your mouth. In fact, 
I’d love to chat in real life if you ever want to conﬁ  rm your sneaking suspicions that I’m an obnoxious proselyte, so long as I’m not running late to a class.  
(Disclaimer: Punctuality is a growth opportunity for 
me.)  
You might not hate me as much as you suspect you do.I suppose I’ve earned myself some haters, but I’m not bit-
ter, because I’ll readily admit that I’m preachy sometimes.  I’m a big boy , so I promise I won’t be offended if you take what I say with a grain of salt.  Feel free to challenge me and what I believe.   
However, don’t fool yourself into thinking that you’re 
not getting a sermon from everyone else who writes for this paper. They might not write about spirituality and the Bible, but most are preaching something they want you to believe.
My only request is that you examine my claims.  In essence, taste the “cheesecake,” and see if it’s good. I 
ﬁ  rmly believe that God was not meant to be explained, but fully experienced, and he’s way better than a measly slice of cheesecake.   
Perhaps it won’t be your favorite, but I get the feeling you 
won’t hate it quite as much as you did before you actually tried it out.  I could be wrong, though.  
Again, it’s only an opinion.As for me, I’m looking forward to another round of 
pumpkin cheesecake this year.   
In case there was any doubt, I’m talking to you, Supripri.  Ryan Galloway is a religion senior at UF . His column appears

Letter to the Editor
The blackface incident last 
week offers UF an opportu-nity to consider substantive 
educational opportunities to dimin-ish the likelihood of these events happening again at a student orga-nization event.
Two weeks ago, members of the 
UF Association of Black Alumni returned to UF in record numbers for Black Alumni Weekend 2012. It was a blessed weekend during which we welcomed back UF’s first black student, who enrolled in 1958; honored UF’s first black graduate, who made history 50 years ago in 1962; enjoyed a tailgate reunion; and hosted a program in which we paid tribute to alumni athletes who made significant contributions to UF history. The weekend culminat-ed with an awards dinner where we honored distinguished Gator alum-ni. Most important, the weekend afforded black alumni the oppor -
tunity to return to our alma mater and strengthen our Gator bonds. It was a perfect alumni weekend, so I was saddened to receive recent calls and emails from black students and black alumni advising me of the of-fensive blackface incident at a UF student organization event.
The unavoidable irony is we 
were just in Gainesville and met two historical figures who predated every other black student who has attended UF. Imagine being the first and only black student enrolled in a university system where school ad-ministrators, elected leaders in Tal-lahassee and the Florida Supreme Court openly denied the Supreme Court’s decisions to keep black stu-dents out of the UF. Truth be told, the entire state of Florida denied black students access to higher edu-cation, not only UF. Imagine some of the insensitive comments he ex-perienced in 1958, some emanating from racism and hatred, others out of ignorance.
After receiving student and 
alumni emails about the blackface incident, I could not help but recall the remarks of our keynote speaker, who was a Jewish student in 1958 who befriended the first black stu-dent. He provided a firsthand ac-count of the climate in 1958 and re-counted how easy it was to become socially isolated in an unwelcoming environment. Blackface in 2012 is not a comforting environment to Gators who are keenly aware of its history and how it was used to cari-cature and insult black citizens in the late 19th century and most of the 20th century . Many black citizens were even distraught when black citizens were “invited” to blackface to earn a living.
African-American students are 
expressing their feelings about the blackface incident, and they should. Their great-grandparents experi-enced indignities and couldn’t say very much about it. Their grand-parents challenged the status quo and blazed a path for their parents to follow. Today , Gator students are rightfully articulating why black-face is offensive to many Americans who no longer see racist cartoons, epithets and caricatures as friendly forms of entertainment. I hope ad-ministrators, faculty, staff, students and the community will hear them and have an open mind about why a demeaning form of entertainment, which the majority of the popula-tion accepted in the 19th century and large part of the 20th century, is unacceptable today.
Black students and black faculty 
and staff have told me that some leaders in UF’s Multicultural and Diversity Affairs erroneously be-lieve we are in a “postracial society” and are managing the department accordingly . The immediate past director of the Institute of Black Culture concurred with that percep-tion. If true, I am deeply concerned about a leadership philosophy that has not aggressively adopted the breadth and depth of education and programming necessary to help all students appreciate the diverse business world they will navigate after completing their university studies. I am told other incidents have occurred before the blackface incident, and I am moved by the concerns of students and faculty/staff who believe an aggressive, appropriate education campaign is lacking.
I am surprised fellow Gators at-
tending a world-class institution like UF concluded it was a good idea to attend a student organiza-tion event in blackface, and I am disappointed they did not consider what that blackface represents to so many of their fellow Gators. I recall when students at that school up north hosted a “pimps and hoes party” — seriously . Students found that event offensive, and students find blackface in 2012 offensive as well.
As a veteran who served in uni-
form for more than 20 years, I have a deep respect for freedom of speech and expression. The men and wom-en of America’s military have worn the uniform, and many have died so that we remain a free country . The two examples I cited above and wearing a Nazi uniform outside a Holocaust Museum are examples of free speech/expression that are of-fensive and disappointing to most decent people. We must remember that we live in a free country where even the most controversial forms of political and offensive speech are protected. I am proud to live in a country where the government cannot force me to vote, speak or express myself in the exact manner my neighbor thinks I should.
While the law protects our fel-
low Gators’ freedom to say or ex-press themselves in this offensive manner, their fellow students and members of the university commu-nity do not have to, nor should they , turn a blind eye to this or similar in-cidents. I commend those students, faculty and staff members who are expressing their opposition to rac-ist cartoons, caricatures and insults within Gator Nation. 
To be clear, this is not 1958. For 
the majority of Gators in the Gator Nation, racist cartoons, epithets and caricatures are not acceptable and will not be dismissed or ignored with a wave of the hand.
Finally , I found that a newspaper 
published a report that the president of the student organization, and the two students acknowledged this was a mistake, and they publicly apologized. If this is true, I salute these young men for their public apologies. It is difficult to publicly admit to a mistake. It is even more difficult to apologize. The leader of the organization should be com-mended for making such a state-ment on behalf of his organization, and the two students showed cour -
age to admit their mistake rather than dig in their heels and refuse to acknowledge why this could be troubling to many of their fellow Gators.
Whether an innocent mistake or 
deliberate mischief, the university must move aggressively to shape the community environment it wants to read about in newspapers and magazines. This week’s Town Hall meeting will be meaningless and superficial if not followed up with substantive actions to help stu-dents better understand the diverse workforce they are about to enter. I am encouraged to see students, faculty/staff and alumni helping to make the university community the thriving place all Gators want it to be.

could cost a person an extra 
$8,000 to $12,000.
Meldon said attorney fees 
range from $2,500 to $10,000, depending on if it’s an indi-vidual’s ﬁ  rst or second of-fense and whether there is property damage or bodily injury. He said a DUI man-slaughter charge could cost an individual more than $10,000 and with about 10 to 15 years in state prison.
If convicted with a DUI, 
extra consequences include court costs that range between $500 and $750, a minimum of 50 hours of community ser-vice and the cost of substance abuse counseling.
Barber said most of the 
time, drivers don’t recognize their level of intoxication.
He said the driver’s friends 
are usually also impaired, so judgment as a group can be off as well.
Barber said drivers should 
plan ahead and ﬁ  gure out how they are going to get home before they start to drink.
To avoid driving impaired, 
he suggests calling a taxi, rid-ing the Later Gator or riding with a designated driver.He also said it could be 
dangerous for individuals to walk intoxicated by them-selves because they could get robbed, beaten or sexu-ally battered. However, he said, they should choose this option instead of driving drunk.
Barber said if you try to 
drink and drive, then you should c o n s i d e r 
other alter-natives be-fore putting the key in the ignition.
“If an of-
ﬁ  cer ﬁ  nds you slumped over your driving wheel in a park-ing lot or in a roadway, you are still eligible for DUI inves-tigation,” he said.
Businesses are also pre-
paring for the increase of cus-tomers.
J.D. Chester, owner of the 
local bar Fat Daddy’s, said his staff will take the usual mea-sures to ensure the safety of their customers.
“We’re not going to do 
anything different than we would any other night, which is if someone is really, really drunk, we get them a cab,” Chester said.8, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 31, 2012

face incident at the Senate meeting Tuesday night in the Holland Law Center at the Levin College of Law. 
Meldon
SAFETY , from page 1Drivers should plan 
rides before leaving for the night to drinkGroups requested a formal apology
from the students who wore the 
blackface, a cultural competency training program for all Greek or-ganizations, cultural competency training as part of the general undergraduate education curricu-lum and an addendum to the uni-versity code of conduct to deﬁ  ne blackface as hate speech.  
Student Body Vice President Sa-
bine Justilien said black students attending UF are looked upon as a “commodity.” In leadership and academia, they are often viewed as numbers instead of judged by the quality of their characters, Justilien said.
After the meeting, Senate Presi-
dent Christina Bonarrigo said the Senate Executive Committee will discuss the ﬁ  ve points that were brought up and discuss how to move forward.
Student Body President Tj Vil-
lamil said he was disappointed by the two brothers. He said he wants to start an educational se-ries about what blackface is and black history.
“At the end of the day, I really 
hope we are all orange and blue,” he said after the meeting.
The public is invited to a Town 
Hall meeting at 7 p.m. Thursday in the Rion Ballroom.
Thursday’s Town Hall will en-
able conversation between stu-dents and administration about the issue, Justilien said.
“Now we have their attention,” 
she said.
Both Vice President for Stu-
dent Affairs Dave Kratzer and UF President Bernie Machen have ad-dressed the incident in letters to students.

◗ THE CONCERT IS AT 9 P.M.
KELLY HAWKINS
Alligator Contributing Writer
Spooky sounds will come from Cen-
tury Tower tonight at 9 p.m. when the 
UF Carillon Studio performs its ﬁ  rst-ever Halloween-themed concert.
Audience members who gather at the 
tower’s base can watch a video screen to look inside the studio and watch the musicians as they play 10 pieces.
Laura Ellis, associate professor of 
music at UF and carillon instructor, said the show will begin with political sci-ence senior John Hendley performing “Hear the wild alarum bells — brazen bells” by Robert Kleinschmidt.The tune should be recognized, be-
cause it’s played frequently, Ellis said. She said she chose the piece to open the show because it is “loud and lam-baste.”
While titles like “Toccata in D minor” 
and “Danse Macabre” might not ring a bell for most audience members, the tunes most likely will — they’re com-monly in horror movie soundtracks.
There’s one piece no one will rec-
ognize, because it has never been per-formed before.
Public relations senior Harold A. 
Rocha, 22, will perform “Fantasia on ‘Dies irae,’” which he composed. To-night, he’ll play it as a duet with Ellis.
“It’s a fantasy,” Rocha said. “The 
piece doesn’t have a structure, so it evolves organically.”Carillon concert tonight

Leather pants, black tank top, high heels, 
ears and a tail — Ariel Angelico is ready for 
Halloween.
The 21-year-old public relations senior 
said she’ll wear a cat costume because it’s easy and cheap.
According to a study from the National 
Retail Federation, Angelico isn’t alone. The company estimated more than 1 mil-lion American adults will dress up as cats for Halloween. Other popular costumes, as culled from the responses of about 9,300 people, include witches, vampires, Batman characters and princesses.
Nava Ottenberg, owner of Persona Vin-
tage Clothing & Costumes in Gainesville, said the store’s most sought-after costumes differ from the ﬁ  ndings. She said she’s seen interest in pirate, disco, superhero and “Al-ice in Wonderland” clothing.
People’s costume choices could also give 
clues about their love lives, according to a study released by www.WhatsYourPrice.com. 
UF assistant psychology professor 
Gregory Webster said he disagreed with drawing conclusions based on Halloween costumes.
“Costumes are something you wear one 
day a year,” he said.
Stephanie Baguidy, a 20-year-old pub-
lic relations junior, said if she dresses up, she’ll be an NBA player. Baguidy said she doesn’t plan to spend a lot of money on her costume.
“It’s only a one-night thing,” she said. “I 
don’t need to be that into it.”
As for Angelico, having a popular cos-
tume isn’t a problem.
“Maybe I’ll ﬁ  nd a bunch of other cats,” 
she said.Cat is most popular costumeHALLOWEENWEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 31, 2012

� MISSOURI LEADS THE NCAA 
WITH 17 FORCED FUMBLES.
  JOSH JURNOVOY
 Alligator Staff Writer
 
  After Florida forced four fum-
bles and recovered three of them  
in its 44-11 win against South Carolina on Oct. 20, cornerback Loucheiz Purifoy explained the concept of “violators.”
  Defensive coordinator Dan 
Quinn coined the term to describe opposing players who don’t pro-tect the ball, and Florida had a process for identifying them.
  Georgia had the better results 
on Saturday. 
The Bulldogs forced four fum-
bles and six turnovers in their 17-9 win against the Gators. 
  “The turnovers were the killer 
in the game,” UF coach Will Mus-champ said. “When you turn the ball over six times, you’re going to have a hard time beating any-one.”
  Protecting the ball won’t be 
any easier when Florida faces Missouri on Saturday. 
  Despite not earning its ﬁ  rst 
Southeastern Conference win until last weekend against Ken-tucky, Missouri leads the country with 17 forced fumbles — ﬁ  ve more than any other team in the conference.
  “They’re going to be aware of 
it,” offensive coordinator Brent Pease said of the Gators’ ap-proach to the Tigers’ ability to force fumbles. “They’re going to know because you look at a few plays on ﬁ  lm, I mean (Sheldon) Richardson, he strips one, picks it up and runs it back against Ken-tucky all the way to the 20-yard line.”
  Richardson, a junior defensive 
lineman, leads Missouri with 57 tackles and four sacks. He ranks third on the team with two forced fumbles. 
Linebacker Andrew Wilson 
leads the unit with four forced fumbles, and fellow linebacker Donovan Bonner is second with three. Florida looking to correct ball security issues before Saturday

  As Jordan Reed neared the 
end zone, he left the ground, and the ball left his grasp.
  Georgia defensive back 
Sanders Commings recovered Reed’s fumble in the end zone, ending Florida’s chances of victory in Saturday’s 17-9 loss in Jacksonville.
  Despite the turnover with 
the game on the line, the Gators still have faith in Reed. 
  “The guy was trying to 
make a play,” coach Will Mus-champ said. 
“I’m never going to disrupt 
a guy from trying to make a play.”
  Reed, who leads Florida 
with 30 catches for 355 yards this season, has shown a ten-dency to jump to make plays since switching to tight end. Against Texas A&M on Sept. 8, Reed caught a second-quar-ter pass, ran 5 yards, hurdled a defender and tacked on 25 more yards.
  “It’s been working for him,” 
Jeff Driskel said of Reed’s jumping. “He makes plays. He’s a playmaker. He tried to do a little too much. ... Unfor-tunately, (he) fumbled the ball. But he’s a great player, and we want the ball in his hands.”
Replacing Patton: Solomon 
Patton is done for the season with a broken bone in the up-per half of his left arm, open-ing the door for Andre De-bose.
  Instead of phasing Patton’s 
signature jet sweep out of Florida’s game plan, offensive coordinator Brent Pease said Debose could assume Patton’s role as the Gators’ change-of-pace speedster.Patton has car-ried 14 times for 140 yards this season.
  “Debose can do it,” Pease 
said. “He’s been kind of the guy that’s taken some reps on it. When [Patton] got hurt, that deﬁ  nitely kind of threw a twist on some things for us.”
  Debose has not touched 
the ball much offensively this season. 
The junior has just three 
rushing attempts for 7 yards and one catch for 5 yards, which came against Georgia on Saturday.
  “Andre needs to step it up 
a little bit and help us in some 
Tight end still has team’s trust END OF GREGULATION
  Offensive coordinator Brent Pease said the Trey Burton wildcat — or WildBurton, 
as it will henceforth be called — is here to stay. 
  On the surface, that seems 
smart. Excluding fake punts and ﬁ  eld goals, UF has snapped the ball to Burton 30 times and gained  6.9 yards per play. That’s a pretty solid total, considering the rest of the offense gains an average of 5.1 yards per play. 
  But, if you take away Burton’s 
perfectly blocked, poorly defend-ed 80-yard touchdown run against Tennessee, the WildBurton’s other 29 plays have gained an average of just 4.4 yards. 
  The numbers say Burton is at 
the center of the problem. Of the 30 plays run out of his formation, he’s either handed the ball off or pitched it 12 times. Those 12 plays have netted 90 yards — a 7.5 yards per play average — and a touch-down. 
  Burton 
has aver-aged 6.5 yards per play on the 18 plays w h e r e he’s kept 
the ball, which is basically a neg-ligible difference over such a small sample. 
  But, removing his 80-yard 
touchdown, Burton has averaged just 2.2 yards per carry on 17 runs.
  Still, that’s not the most damn-
ing stat. 
The WildBurton doesn’t accom-
plish its primary mission. 
  Most teams view wildcat pack-
ages as a way to grind out 3 or 4 yards to either move the chains or set up manageable second- and third-down situations.  
  Because Florida ranks No. 118 UF should phase out

UF quarterback14, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 31, 2012
nationally and last in the Southeastern 
Conference with 143.6 passing yards per game, avoiding third-and-long is essen-tial. 
The Gators have converted just 16.7 
percent of their third-down tries with 9 or more yards to go.  
Florida should be focused on avoid-
ing negative plays, so giving the ball to Burton is a bad idea. 
Of Burton’s 18 carries out of the for -
mation, five have gone for negative yards, totaling a loss of 15 yards. By comparison, Mike Gillislee has lost only 22 yards in 161 carries — nearly 10 times Burton’s total. 
Instead of feeding Burton, Florida 
should just keep working the ball to Gil-lislee. 
While his torrid pace has slowed in 
the past three games, Gillislee still looks as fast, shifty and tough to tackle as ever. 
If Pease and the Gators still want 
to run the WildBurton plays, just let Driskel quarterback them.
 Driskel is bigger, faster, stronger, 
more elusive and a better passer than Burton. 
Perhaps Florida is concerned about 
Driskel taking too much of a pounding, but he can handle it. 
Those two or three extra carries per 
game aren’t going to make that much of a difference. 
Coaches should let UF’s quarterback 
of the present and future take every snap he can. The experience will only help his development.  
That being said, coaches are right to 
have the Burton package. 
If opposing defenses don’t take the 
time to prepare, an unorthodox look has the potential to make them pay, and Pease will likely recognize that early on. But, if the defenses are ready, leave the WildBurton on the sidelines and hope the base offense can take advantage.  
Either way, Burton shouldn’t be the 
one taking the snaps.

Debose’s reps have been limited to 
the return game. 
He currently ranks fifth in the 
Southeastern Conference with 24.1 yards per kick return and eighth with 9.3 yards per punt return. 
Debose holds the school record for 
most kickoff return touchdowns with three but has yet to reach the end zone in 2012.
On Sept. 22, a reporter asked Mus-
champ why Debose had not been more involved offensively. 
Muschamp replied: “He just needs 
to practice better. If he practices better, he’ll play more.”

NOTES , from page 13ADAM LICHTENSTEIN
Alligator Writer
For Annie Speese, 13 is a lucky 
number.
The sophomore midfielder dons 
the number when she takes the 
field, and through two seasons at Florida, it has worked out well for her. In her career, she has scored 13 goals and recorded 13 assists.
“Her technical ability is on an-
other level,” fellow midfielder Er -
ika Tymrak said. “Her left-footed shot is deadly.”
Speese showed off her danger-
ous left foot last week when she scored twice against South Caroli-na in Florida’s 3-0 victory. Both of her goals came after she entered as a substitute in the 71st minute. 
“After the game, [assistant 
coach Alan Kirkup] said, ‘Well maybe we need to not keep you in the starting lineup,’” coach Becky Burleigh said.
Said Speese: “That’s not really 
the point I was trying to make.”Speese’s two late goals sealed 
the victory and the Southeastern Conference title for the Gators but highlighted a flaw in their play.
Both of Speese’s goals, along 
with Adriana Leon’s game-win-ner, came late in the game. When Florida (14-4-1, 12-2 SEC) faces Mississippi (13-8, 5-8 SEC) in its first match in the SEC Tournament today, the team will try to score early and not play from behind.
“[Scoring early] would help us 
get composed and relaxed really early,” Speese said.
Since defeating Texas A&M 
on Oct. 7, Florida has scored only one first-half goal — a fifth-min-ute score from McKenzie Barney 
against Missis-sippi State on 
Oct. 14.
In the regu-
lar season, the Gators sur-rendered the opening goal of a match eight times. Florida 
pulled out five victories in those eight games but lost matches to Miami and Alabama. Neither team was ranked when it faced Florida, but each rode first-half offense to a victory.
When UF faced Ole Miss on 
Sept. 28, midfielder Havana Solaun buried a goal in the 15th minute, and Florida cruised to a 3-1 win. If the Gators want a repeat per-formance, they need to find their early scoring touch.
Said midfielder Holly King: 
“We have to somehow get our-selves amped up to go in the first half, rather than let it linger, play possession and then in the second half, strike.”
Prior to Saturday’s loss, the Gators 
had fumbled only three times in 2012, 
and Driskel had accounted for just one of them.
His two fumbles against the Bulldogs 
came on a botched zone-read and a pass play during which he held on to the ball too long. Since the loss, Driskel has em-phasized the importance of taking care of the ball.
“Obviously turning the ball over’s 
not going to give you more confidence,” Driskel said. “Hopefully I got it out of my system. Like I said earlier, you’ve got to learn from mistakes. (I) got the mistakes out of the way. (I will) learn from them and try not to make the same mistakes again.”
Driskel has been criticized for taking 
sacks, but Pease said he would rather the quarterback hold on to the ball than try to force a play. Pease added that ball se-curity would be a focal point in practice this week.
“If you don’t put that in the back of 
your mind and understand you’ve got to get better from it and tighten it down in practice, the same thing can happen,” Pease said. 
“We’ll go back and recreate drills that 
we’ve got to put some emphasis in that this week.”
Center Jonotthan Harrison said the of-
fense won’t let Missouri’s ball-hawking tendencies affect its preparation.
“We’re going to go in there with the 
attitude that as long as we know all of our assignments are understood, and as long as we focus on ball security throughout this week, that we’ll go in there and we’ll be a successful team,” Harrison said. “We won’t hype it up to be something and psych ourselves out. You know, play the game before we even get to the game on Saturday.”

Freshman Michael Frazier II poses at UF’s media day on Oct. 
10. Florida plays its ﬁ  rst exhibition on Thursday at 7 p.m. 
 LANDON WATNICK
 Alligator Writer
 
  From a young age, Michael Fra-
zier II reveled in the thought of at-
tending UF. 
  The Tampa native grew up admir-
ing Gators basketball greats such as Jason Williams, Udonis Haslem and Corey Brewer. 
  “It’s always been my dream 
school,” Frazier said. “Even if I didn’t play basketball, I always wanted to come here.” 
  So when coach Billy Donovan of-
fered Frazier a scholarship midway through high school, the shooting guard seized the opportunity. 
  Frazier, a four-star recruit ranked 
No. 88 in the 2012 class by Rivals.com, verbally committed to Florida on Aug. 24, 2010. 
  The 6-foot-4, 200-pound freshman 
hopes to provide a spark off the bench for the No. 10 Gators this season. Last year at Montverde Academy, he dis-played a strong mid-range game and the ability to attack the rim. He is also a catch-and-shoot threat beyond the arc. 
  Playing alongside 2013 UF point 
guard commit Kasey Hill, Frazier averaged a team-best 17 points per game during his senior year. 
  “He has a nice shot,” redshirt se-
nior guard Mike Rosario said. “He can shoot the ball. … He could provide some shots for us off the bench.”
  Frazier is one of four Florida fresh-
men looking to crack the rotation, joining Braxton Ogbueze, DeVon Walker and Dillon Graham. Dono-van is conﬁ  dent in his seven return-ing players  logging the majority of minutes. 
  “The encouraging part of our 
freshmen is they’ve been able to sus-tain a level of intensity, they’re work-ing hard every day and they’re mak-ing practice very competitive for us,” Donovan said. “But there’s still an enormous amount those guys have to learn.” 
  If Frazier ﬁ  nds a role in the rota-
tion, it may be at small forward. The freshman has practiced at small for-ward and shooting guard. 
  Frazier said he can defend and re-
bound against bigger forwards.
  His case for playing time could 
beneﬁ  t from forward Cody Larson’s departure. With Florida thin in the frontcourt, Casey Prather is likely to see time at power forward, and Will Yeguete will often shift to the center spot. The Gators might need a swing-man like Frazier to round out the ro-tation.
  The freshman will get the chance 
to showcase his scoring prowess when No. 10 Florida squares off against Nebraska-Kearney in an ex-hibition game on Thursday night at 7 in the O’Connell Center.
  “It’s deﬁ  nitely exciting,” Frazier 
said. “Whenever I get my chance to go in and play, (I’ll) just play as hard as I can.”
