When Brooke Emory was 
six years old, doctors found a 
brain tumor on her optic nerve, the cause behind her recurring migraines. Rather than having 
the tumor removed via sur-
gery, which would likely cause blindness, she underwent 18 months of chemotherapy.
Five years later, she is can-
cer free.
Emory’s was one of 24 sto-
ries shared this weekend by children or their family mem-
bers at UF’s 15th annual Dance 
Marathon.
Dance Marathon raises 
money for the Children’s Mir-acle Network, a nonprofit orga-nization that  funds medical ex-penses and research at Shands Children’s Hospital at UF.The event took place this 
weekend in the O’Connell Cen-ter, which was decorated with signs and banners from the so-rorities, fraternities and other organizations that participated. 
Starting at 11:48 a.m. on Sat-
urday, about 600 dancers stood for 26.2 hours, which was a piece of cake for some veteran 
dancers. 
UF graduate student Matt 
Michel, a sixth-year dancer, said during his first Dance Mar-
athon, he stood for 32 hours.
“Thankfully it’s been short-
ened to 26 hours,” he said. “It’s Dance event

A former Gainesville resident will be 
charged with video voyeurism this week 
after admitting to taking pictures of a 
woman in a Home Depot restroom in Feb-ruary.When Timothy Malone, 30, was ar-
rested Thursday on three charges of child pornography, Gainesville Police Depart-ment detectives got a warrant to search his 
computer.
While going through his files, detec-
tives found pictures taken by Malone’s cell 
phone, which was positioned to look up the woman’s dress, GPD spokesman Keith Kameg said.
The incident occurred 
on Feb. 18 at the Home Depot on Northwest 13th 
Street, according to an in-
cident report.
Kameg said security 
cameras recorded Malone  
walking into the store and following a woman into the bathroom.
When the 21-year-old woman saw a 
hand holding a cell phone under the stall to take pictures of her, she screamed, and 
the man ran out, Kameg said.

With the hope of putting an ini-
tiative for medical marijuana on 
Florida’s 2010 ballot, UF’s chapter 
of People United for Medical Mari-juana is collecting signatures for its campaign.
The initiative would allow pa-
tients of cancer, chronic pain, sei-
zures and other diseases to cultivate, 
purchase, possess and use medical marijuana as prescribed by a doctor.
The campaign must collect sig-natures of at least 700,000 registered 
voters and reach 8 percent of the total voters in 13 of the 26 
Florida congressional 
districts, according to 
William Sanchez, the local chapter director.The campaign would require 
32,146 signatures from District 6, which contains Gainesville, to reach 8 percent, according to Kim Russell, 
founder of People United. She ex-
pects to reach this goal, she said.
In fact, Russell feels confident 
about the initiative’s chances state-wide.
“With such a huge elderly popu-
lation in Florida, a lot of baby boom-ers are watching their parents die a 
painful death that could be helped 
with a little medical marijuana,” she said.Man charged with possession of child pornography

Man’s DNA leads to rape charge
A Gainesville man was charged Thurs-
day with the rape and murder of a Texas 
woman after spending two years in a Florida prison on an unrelated felony charge.
Officials took a DNA sample from pris-
oner Lucky Odom, 52, in 2007 and sent it to a national DNA database, Gainesville Police Department spokesman Keith Kameg said.
Odom’s DNA was linked to that of the 
sperm found on the body of Kathryn Mun-roe, who was murdered in 1982, he said.Munroe was about to enter her sopho-
more year as a medical student at Texas Col-lege of Osteopathic Medicine when she was raped and strangled on the playground of a Fort Worth elementary school, an article in the Fort Worth Star-Telegram stated.
While living in Gainesville, Odom was 
arrested for stealing copper and selling it, Kameg said. He was caught in 2006 by a GPD detective and arrested on several felo-ny charges, he said.

Four hundred years since Galileo Galilei first gazed into 
outer space, UF scientists are still searching the corners of 
the universe  through new technological developments.
About 115 people gathered to honor Galileo’s discover-
ies and celebrate the International Year of Astronomy on Friday night at the New Physics Building, hosted by UF’s Department of Astronomy and the Alachua County As-tronomy Club.
Visitors could view a projection screen hanging near 
the entrance showing the program “Around the World in 80 Telescopes.” The show was a live, 24-hour broadcast of the efforts of about 140 countries to bring attention to as-
tronomy and some of the most advanced observatories in 
the world, said UF astronomy professor Vicki Sarajedini, a coordinator of the event.
She said UF astronomy professor 
Anthony Gonzalez broadcasted from Gainesville on Saturday at 3 a.m. to tout UF’s recent development of the CanariCam, an infrared camera meant 
to capture images of very cold objects 
in space. It was made for a recently 
built observatory in the Canary Islands, which UF helped fund.
UF contributed about five percent 
of the project’s cost, which totaled about $130 million, in exchange for five percent of the available observation time, according to the observatory’s Web site at gtcdigital.net.
To kick off the night, UF astronomy professors Eliza-
beth Lada and Rafael Guzman showcased photographs of 
Galileo’s equipment and the extent of today’s space explo-
ration. Lada spoke on Galileo’s life, discoveries and what scientists expect he saw during his first glance into space.
She said the most important lesson to take from his 
life’s work is the practice of questioning everything.
“For today’s science, especially astronomy, it’s really 
only the beginning,” she said, “so don’t be afraid to make leaps of judgment.”
Guzman addressed the abilities of today’s telescopes 
and future advances.
“Unfortunately, we can’t travel further than our solar 
system because we don’t have the right equipment yet,” he said.
But scientists can at least see those billions of galaxies in 
the distance, which are clustered together in patterns that resemble a human body’s sensory cell pathways, he said.
But even with scientific advancements, mapping out 
the universe with only the light of the stars as a guide can 
be inaccurate.
“There might be more than what we see,” Guzman 
said.LoCALUF celebrates

� ABOUT 60 PEOPLE ATTENDED THE 3-D EXHIBIT.

Most museums warn patrons to keep their hands off the 
art, but at Saturday’s MindSight exhibit, people were en-
couraged to do the opposite. 
Tour guides led about 60 blindfolded people through 
a room of three-dimensional pieces, ranging from smooth wooden sculptures to paintings embellished with beads and nails. The exhibit, organized by the Harn Museum and the Gator Lions Club, featured the work of 10 Gainesville art-ists.
There was a dual purpose, according to Gator Lions Club 
member Shelly Flanagin: to create an artistic experience that didn’t require sight and to help sighted people understand what art is for people who can’t see.
Five visually impaired people attended the show, Flanag-
in said.
Each tour guide led guests around the room by elbow, al-
lowing the guests to run their hands over ceramic opossums and ocean scenes made of sand and glass. Participants were 
encouraged to guess what they were feeling.
“A lot of people are really good with eyes, 
noses, mouths,” she said. “A lot of (the pieces) are trickier, though. They require more imag-
ining.”
Vinnie Squitiro, a science and management graduate stu-
dent, said that touching the art before viewing it allowed him to better understand it.
“Now that I see everything after having the blindfold 
on,” he said, “it’s strange to see how different it looks based on what I was expecting.”Exibit allows for blind art experience

her poems, written about living in poverty, in her home Friday night. Winthrop attends open mic poetry events around Gainesville so she can share her work.

According to the GPD arrest report, when Malone moved to Lake Butler, Stratiria Scott subleased his apartment at 3100 S.W. 35th Place.
Scott called the police on March 26 and 
told officers that she found a metal tin in the apartment containing three pages of laminated child pornography pictures, the report stated.
Officers found more than 
100 pornographic images of minors from 2 to 17 years old, 
Kameg said. 
According to the arrest report, children 
in the pictures were having sex with other children and adults.
Kameg said more pornographic pic-
tures were found on Malone’s computer.

Scrawled on a ripped piece of 
paper on Marcee Lee Winthrop’s 
refrigerator are the words, “When I 
want to cry, I will laugh instead.” 
The phrase is Winthrop’s mantra, 
and the same  sense of determina-
tion resonates in her poetry, which she hopes will be her lifeline out of poverty. 
She started writing poetry as part 
of a New Year’s resolution to live up to her potential and improve her 
life. When her husband left in early 
March, Winthrop and her 13-year-old daughter Tammy were left on their own.  
Winthrop, 54, had all of her teeth 
at 13, but she now only has three visible front teeth — a physical char-acteristic that she said keeps her un-employed, along with her lack of job 
experience. Medical care, doctors’ 
visits and dental work are luxuries she can’t afford, she said.
“I try to make a joke of it, but it 
hurts inside,” she said. “I used to smile all the time… that seems so far away.”
Timid because of her appearance, 
Winthrop puts aside her insecurities 
to take the stage at venues such as 
UF’s Orange & Brew during open mic poetry nights. She hopes that her poetry will help people under-stand the hardships of poverty and take action against it.Winthrop, who lives in a mobile 
home on Southwest Archer Road about 10 minutes outside of Gaines-ville’s city limits, said she and her daughter attend poetry readings around Gainesville, often traveling for more than an hour on two buses. Winthrop said she plans to share her poetry as long as she has money for bus fares or rides from friends. 
She will read her work at the Civic 
Media Center’s Weekly Poetry Jam Thursday night.
“When you’re in need, you start 
thinking boldly,” she said. 
The first poem she wrote, called 
“I am a Face of Poverty in America,” 
addresses her anger with the U.S. 
government, which she said treats her as an “expendable soul” because of her poverty. 
Winthrop said her experiences 
seeking government assistance have been frustrating, especially due to her lack of transportation. A lot of poor people feel like cattle wander-
ing from building to building, ref-
erenced as a number instead of a name, she said.
Her poems address the hardships 
and the sense of shame that often ac-company poverty, overlooked by people who have never experienced 
them. When she eats, she must chew 
carefully because of her fragile re-maining teeth. When she walks 10 blocks home from the grocery store, the plastic bags dig into her hands, making them numb. 
Winthrop said she hopes to pub-
lish books of her poetry. She has the titles already picked out, and she 
wants the first to be “Poverty Revo-
lution Part 1: Skimming the Sur-face,” she said with a grin.  
So far, she’s written 10 poems 
with commentary of each poem’s inspiration, she said.
Winthrop does most of her writ-
ing in coffee shops, such as Barnie’s Coffee & Tea Co., while Tammy sits 
with her and draws, often cartoons. 
Home-schooled since first grade, 
Tammy travels everywhere with her 
mom.
“I cheer her on as much as I can,” 
Tammy said. “I think daughters should cheer their moms on. They need support, too.” 
Family, friends and neighbors 
support Winthrop’s ambitions.
Edwin Luciano, who has known 
Winthrop since she moved into the neighborhood a few years ago, said he admires Winthrop.
“She’s stepping out and doing 
something special,” he said. “It just goes into people’s hearts and makes a difference.”

Every hour dancers performed a five-minute line dance 
to a medley composed of ‘NSync, Lady Gaga and Def Lep-
pard. 
Michel, who came to the event with a sprained ankle, 
said although someone stepped on his foot while learning the line dance, he had come prepared with ice and a soft-boot cast.
UF sophomore Jessica Stark said she found it physically 
exhausting to be standing for so long,  but took strength from the cause.  
“My favorite part about (Dance Marathon) is hearing the 
miracle children’s stories and what they’ve been through,” Stark said. “When I’m dancing, it helps me keep going.”
While dancers stood around, they played games, 
watched performances and spent time with Albert and Alberta. Once the Apocalypse Dance Troupe had finished their performance, they challenged members of the morale team, Dance Marathon staff who are in charge of keeping dancers motivated, to a dance off.  
Later in the night, dancers celebrated the event’s 15th 
occurrence by signing a banner, decorating party hats and singing “Happy Birthday.” UF quarterback Tim Tebow also 
stopped by the birthday celebration to give some words of 
encouragement to the dancers.
“It’s something amazing that you’re doing here for all 
these kids,” he said.
Dancers finally took a load off at 2 p.m. on Sunday, sit-
ting themselves on the dance floor during the closing cer-emonies, where Dance Marathon staffers announced that  $413,562.34 was raised this year.About 600 people participated in UF’s 15th annual Dance MarathonMONDAY, APRIL 6, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 5

Dancers at the 15th annual Dance Marathon at UF for the Children’s Miracle Network spell out the initials of the orga -
nization in the O’Connell Center. About 600 students danced nonstop for 26.2 hours from Saturday morning to Sunday 
afternoon in order to raise money for the organization.
Russell also plans to focus on the college 
student vote, she said.
After her father was diagnosed with Par-
kinson’s disease, Russell learned that medical 
marijuana could help treat his symptoms, she said.
But when she spoke to state legislators 
about the possibility of legalization, they told her it would be at least seven to eight years. 
“I decided to do the ballot initiative because 
I can’t wait that long,” she said.
The campaign also wants to raise between 
$5 million and $10 million to pay for political advertising if the initiative reaches the ballot.
The health risks from smoking marijuana 
are still debated, though lung cancer seems only to be a risk in 
long-term heavy users, accord-
ing to several medical research 
articles on UF Shands Cancer Center Web site. Currently, 13 states have legalized medical 
marijuana. New Jersey, Illinois and Minnesota may soon join them.
If the initiative reaches the ballot, People

The Populists are ruining everything. 
You know the type: wanna-be hippie, Whole 
Foods environmentalist, own at least one Che 
Guevara T-shirt (and skinny leg jeans), grew up in a rea-
sonably nice but modest home. Angry.
They are mostly of the donkey mold, and when they 
take to the streets with their Greenpeace T-shirts, they 
head right for the large corporate buildings and yell with 
such venomous rage at the institutions that now hold our financial system horrifically suspended in midair. 
Despite our revolutionary past, our British friends 
are the experts at protesting the power the masters of 
the universe hold. As world leaders all exchanged high-
fives and toothy grins in Buckingham Palace last Thurs-day at the start of the G-20 summit, renegade anarchists stormed the Royal Bank of Scotland in the London finan-
cial district. The London protesters weren’t of a populist 
zeal, but a revolutionary one. Forget British Prime Min-ister Gordon Brown’s suggestion at the G-20 summit of restructuring the global financial marketplace, the revo-lutionaries wanted to burn the whole system down.
For a while, it wasn’t just the far-left fringe of the 
more liberal political parties in the world who were sounding the clarion yell of populist outrage. It was the stalwart Republicans in this country, who didn’t take to 
the streets in army fatigues or hand-me-down Patagonia 
rags, but took to the airwaves instead, in business suits and leftover wardrobe off the set of “The Sopranos.”
The Republicans, traditionally a party of men and 
women whose idea of a good protest is boycotting a Ro-
tary Club president nomination, suddenly found their 
inner populist when President Barack Obama came out with his budget. CNBC commentators went ballistic, decrying the president’s plan to raise taxes back to the rates un-der President Bill Clinton. Bill 
O’Reilly, who fancies himself 
the last bastion of truth, couldn’t wipe the arrogant grin off his face every time the stock market 
worsened. Glenn Beck, who final-
ly figured out that CNN doesn’t stand for Conservative Nutty 
News, finally made the switch to FOX News and called the president a socialist, later apologizing and saying he 
got it all wrong — the president isn’t a socialist, he’s a 
fascist. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is the punchline to a joke that’s taken eight years to tell. An unquestion-ing right-wing social group, that pledges allegiance to 
one leader and demands the same from everyone else 
and goes as far as labeling you an unpatriotic treasonous heretic if you disagree with its ideas and policies, is the very definition of fascism. 
There’s nothing wrong with partisanship or party 
loyalty. There really isn’t much wrong with painting your political opposition unpatriotic and calling upon your television viewers to rise up against “them” and “take back your country” as Glenn Beck has called for. 
Actions like those only make politicians like Obama all 
the more savory. 
It’s just a pity, though, that the Republicans in Wash-
ington and on television have only now summoned the courage to question their president. 
They came to the party eight years too late. Matthew Christ is a political science freshman. His col-
umn appears on Mondays.Beyond inventing a beer 
that helps people lose weight, is there really 
any way to strike it rich dur-ing America’s current run of 
economic downturn?
For Ethan Nicholas, devel-
oping a shoot-em-up video 
game for the iPhone was just the ticket.
Down on his luck and 
drowning in a sea of medical bills, Nicholas drew inspira-tion from one success story 
in which one man netted 
$250,000 seemingly overnight thanks to his iPhone app.
Even though Nicholas was 
well-versed in the geek-speak of programming, he needed to learn Objective C, an en-tirely new language, in order to properly code his creation.
What resulted was iShoot – 
a game not exactly brimming with the bells and whistles of a Google offering, but good enough for Nicholas to take home $800,000 in a mere five months. 
Prospects for iPhone app 
development have caught the attention of Stanford Univer-sity — leading to the creation 
of an undergraduate course 
strictly designed to help stu-dents create the latest flavor of the month for purchase at the Apple App Store.
The Editorial Board can’t 
help but be intrigued by the possibilities offered by creat-ing games and programs for 
the iPhone. 
With a completely over-
hauled version of the iPhone 
set to launch later this year, we can only imagine dollar signs popping up in the eyes of developers everywhere.
If one down-on-his-luck-
programmer can get rich 
quick off a poor man’s Duke 
Nukem, who says a group of mildly intelligent journalists can’t put together the latest killer app by the end of Sum-mer A? Friday’s tragic shooting in Binghamton, N.Y., serves as 
yet another reminder to Americans across the country of the fragility of life.
In the wake of last week’s events, media outlets continue 
to raise questions about the shooter speculating about his mindset to go through with such a sinister act. Rather, what should be talked about are the countless victims and the heartwarming stories about them that make the massacre at the American Civic Association even more devastating.
The 13 individuals who lost their lives on Friday hailed 
from eight different countries — a diverse group of people ranging from Pakistanis to Brazilians.
Take Dolores Yigal for instance, who attended English 
classes at the immigrant community center with hopes of 
mastering the language and furthering herself as a person. 
Another victim, Hong Xiu Mao, known by friends as “Amy,” immigrated from China with hopes of becoming a United States citizen and achieving the American dream. Layla Khalil overcame three different car bombings in her home-land of Iraq before coming to America while in her 50s in an effort to start her life anew. 
Lest we forget to make mention of the heroic efforts made 
by Shirley DeLucia, who had the wherewithal to play dead after being shot to make a phone call to inform authorities of the situation.
As details surrounding the lives of the 13 victims continue 
to come to light, the anecdotes and stories shared by loved ones will serve as a reminder of the ambition and optimism cut short by the selfish actions of one deeply troubled man.

ISIS scheduling errors are unacceptable
I received an e-mail Thursday afternoon 
from Dr. Creed Greer, assistant program di-
rector of the University Writing Program, in-forming me that due to a “scheduling error,” the Writing for Pre-Law section I registered for 
nearly a week and a half ago was closed and 
would not be held in the fall. 
This is overwhelmingly frustrating as this 
“scheduling error” has thrown a wrench into my and many others’ plans. 
Dr. Greer may think an e-mail and a sug-
gestion of other sections to take is enough, but it is not. Someone’s incompetence in schedul-ing sections for the fall is leaving a handful 
of pre-law students high and dry two weeks 
into registration, left with only a sub-par selec-tion of composition courses. If I were trying to graduate in December, I would be livid.

Answer lies in merging, not eliminating
Do you know someone who has or had 
Parkinson’s disease, cerebral palsy, ALS, au-tism, Alzheimer’s disease, a stroke, a traumat-ic brain injury, a hearing impairment, cochlear implant, a cleft lip and/or palate, dyslexia, 
stuttering, or head and neck cancer? 
Imagine what would happen if they needed 
treatment from a speech-language pathologist 
or an audiologist but were unable to find one. Such a scenario is possible under the current CLAS budget proposal that is in the provost’s and president’s hands. This proposal contains two potential outcomes for the Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders.
The first proposal is a merger with the 
Communicative Disorders department in the College of Public Health and Health Profes-sions, which our Student Body fully supports. The second proposal is the complete elimina-tion of our CSD department. We cannot fore-see a future where research on and services to these populations cannot be provided. 
Eliminating our program should never 
have been proposed, as the justification for its closure was not based on its weakness — it is a highly nationally ranked program. Our pro-gram will likely go from excellent to premiere with this merger. There is simply no alterna-tive. Merging the two departments  makes sense 
and will help to advance research and clinical work within our field at UF. By merging these 
programs, UF will maintain our high quality 
of research and will strive for economic effi-ciency in the spirit of the upper administra-tion’s edict. 
As demand for jobs within our field grows, 
UF must continue to provide our nation with high quality speech-language pathologists and audiologists. Through our passion for our field to move our department forward, we 
will continue to do whatever we can to let the 
university know that we won’t tolerate elimi-nation.

ON TELEVISION UP NEXT POLL QUESTION QUOTABLE ONLINEHarrison Diamond / Alligator Staff 
UF senior gymnast Corey Hartung waves to the crowd after an exhibition performance 
on the uneven bars during her final home meet on Mar. 6.
■ HER GRAND SLAM WON 
GAME 2 ON SATURDAY.
By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
aberry@alligator.org
It was the kind of situation 
clutch players dream about: tie 
game, two outs, bases loaded, bot-
tom of the final inning.
With Game 2 of Saturday’s 
doubleheader against Mississip-
pi State tied at 2, Kelsey Bruder 
took a full-count pitch over the 
right-field fence for her first career grand slam, a walk-off bomb that capped off UF’s seventh-inning comeback.
“Coach always says you don’t 
need a home run, you don’t need to be the hero,” Bruder said. “So I thought, ‘I hope he’ll be OK with 
this.’”
UF coach Tim Walton was in-
deed happy with Bruder’s at-bat, 
and the rest of the Gators showed their appreciation by dogpiling 
the sophomore right fielder after 
she crossed home plate. 
“Unbelievable. At second base, 
I was telling her that I’d never 
been — I don’t want to say ner-
vous — but my adrenaline has never rushed that much. Ever,” first baseman Ali Gardiner said. “I knew she was going to get it 
done.”  
With that victory secured, the 
No. 1 Gators (39-3, 17-1 Southeast-
ern Conference) cruised to a series 
sweep against the Bulldogs (17-20, 
2-13 SEC) this weekend at Katie Seashole Pressly Stadium.
On March 28, UF lost its third 
game of the season to Alabama 
despite a last-inning rally. The 
Gators showed what they learned from that experience Saturday.Bruder 
powers UF victoryBy EUGENIO TORRENS
Alligator Writer
In a troupe consisting of Bruins, Pio-
neers, Gophers, Cyclones and Hawkeyes, 
the Gators emerged victorious from the menagerie.
The No. 6 UF gymnastics team won 
the North Central Regional against No. 7 UCLA, Denver, Minnesota, Iowa State and Iowa with a score of 196.775, netting its fifth consecutive NCAA regional title.
Beyond morale, the win propelled the 
Gators to the NCAA Championships in Lincoln, Neb., which begin April 16.
Opening the meet on floor exercise — 
a first for the team in competitive meets 
this season — the Gators posted a 49.075. 
A fall on Courtney Gladys’ last tumbling pass hurt the team, as did a couple of short landings by Melanie Sinclair that resulted in an uncharacteristic 9.6.
“We like the fact they didn’t carry it 
over into the rest of the meet,” UF coach Rhonda Faehn said.
Senior Corey Hartung made her last 
regional appearance count, scoring a 9.925 on her floor routine, which tied her with Denver’s Jessica Lopez for the regional floor title. It marked Hartung’s second re-gional floor title, the other coming in her freshman year.
“We’re more appreciative and more 
honored to be doing this well, considering (we have only eight of 12 gymnasts com-peting),” Hartung said.
From floor, the team moved to vault, 
where consistency was key. The Gators 
didn’t count anything less than a 9.8 to-
ward their 49.225 score. Gladys and Sin-clair rebounded from floor, notching scores of 9.85 and 9.875, respectively. Capturing her second 9.9 in as many events, Maranda Smith led the team on vault.UF GYMNASTICSGators on way to NCAA Championships
The most impressive team on campus plays in a stadium that has no park-ing lot.
Frustrations with traveling to Katie Seas-
hole Pressly Stadium can be forgiven (signs 
point fans to the Center for the Performing 
Arts parking lot, a 5-10 minute walk down Hull Road for a 1,200-seat stadium), but the team inside is well worth the trouble.
The No. 1 UF softball team improved 
to 39-3 after dispatching Mississippi State 3-0 in 91 minutes on Sunday to complete its weekend sweep.
This comes on the heels of a 70-win sea-
son — the most in NCAA history — last year that culminated in the team’s first-ever trip to the Women’s College World Series. It was simply the 
next logical step for a program that is seeing astronomical growth in only its 
13th season. 
Up-and-com-
ing coach Tim 
Walton landed in Gainesville prior to the 2006 season. 
That year, he led UF to an NCAA Regionals appearance. Then he led the Gators to their first-ever NCAA Super Regionals berth in 
2007. The team’s 2008 success has been well 
documented. 
Now, a national title isn’t just a goal. It’s an expectation.
It would be easy to point to the team’s 
outrageous talent, helped by a national re-cruiting approach (only nine of 20 players on the roster hail from Florida). Apparently 
the secret is taught in youth sports pro-
grams across America:
Have fun.“Our secret is just to keep smiling and 
staying goofy,” said senior Stacey Nelson, the team’s electric spark and All-America pitcher. “As long as we’re dancing in the dugout and laughing, things normally go well.”
And the fun starts early. There is no 
mistaking the team for tense at any point

UF senior pitcher Stacey Nelson on how she 
prepared to pitch more innings this week -
end with Stephanie Brombacher sick.

UF right fielder Kelsey Bruder watches as her walk-off grand slam sails out of the park during the Gators’ 
6-2 win against Mississippi State at Katie Seashole Pressly Stadium on Saturday.
UF entered the final frame down 
2-1, but clutch hits from Gardiner 
and Kristina Hilberth — as well 
as a slide by Aja Paculba that pre-
vented the Bulldogs from turning a double play and prematurely end-ing UF’s comeback — kept them in 
the game.
“Alabama showed us a lot about 
ourselves. We can learn a lot from a 
loss,” Bruder said. “We know that we have that drive and that fight at the very end. All the way through, our dugout just stayed in tune. Ev-
erything just came together.”
Senior ace Stacey Nelson won all 
three games for UF over the week-
end, allowing just eight hits in her 
14 innings of work. 
Sophomore pitcher Stephanie 
Brombacher, who has been sick 
with flu-like symptoms since Tues-day, was only able to pitch five in-
nings in Game 2.
Nelson (23-3, 0.48 ERA) pitched 
all five innings of UF’s 11-2 mercy-
rule victory in Game 1 and came in 
to relieve Brombacher in the sixth 
during Game 2, closing the game by giving up no hits and no walks while striking out four batters. 
After Saturday’s dramatic fin-
ish, Sunday’s series finale was far less contested. The Gators scored 3 runs in the second inning, and the teams traded zeros for the rest of 
the game. 
“I like low key. Low key’s nice,” 
UF coach Tim Walton said. 
“We won 3-0 with hardly any 
threats. I thought everybody did their job. Obviously we didn’t re-
ally swing the bat as well as every-body’s used to, but give (Missis-sippi State pitcher Lindsey Dunlap) 
credit.”
UF third baseman Corrie Brooks 
put the first run on the board Sun-
day with a solo home run to left field in the second inning. 
After starting the series 0 for 6 
at the plate, center fielder Michelle Moultrie drove in the Gators’ final 2 runs with a triple down the right-
field line.Nelson earns all three wins in weekend sweep against Mississippi StateBy KYLE MAISTRI

A 14-0 run usually occurs on the 
basketball court, not the baseball 
field.
UF (19-11, 7-5 Southeastern Con-
ference), however, managed to turn 
a 9-2 lead into a 16-9 loss on Sunday 
in its weekend finale with Vander-bilt (19-12, 5-7 SEC) in Nashville, Tenn.
Gators starter Stephen Locke 
came out of the game with a 7-run lead after allowing 2 runs and five hits in five innings of work. Fresh-man Preston Tucker had just hit his second home run of the game, this one a 3-run job that capped a 4-run sixth inning, and the Gators looked like they were well on their way to winning their first road series.
Instead, the Commodores scored 
14 runs in their last three innings, in-cluding a 7-run eighth, completing a wild comeback and earning the se-ries win after the teams split the first two games. 
The biggest contributing factor 
to UF’s collapse was poor infield defense, with shortstop Josh Adams committing two errors and Tucker 
adding another at first base. 
Of the 16 runs the Gators allowed 
on Sunday, only 6 were earned, and all 7 runs scored by Vanderbilt in the 
eighth inning were unearned.
The Gators have made fewer 
errors than their opponents eight 
times this season 
and hold a per-
fect 8-0 record in 
those games. 
UF coach Kev-
in O’Sullivan has said many times that pitching and defense will keep the Gators in 
games. His team showed what can 
happen when those areas go unac-
counted for.
In recent weeks, UF’s starters have failed to go deep into games, putting pressure on the bullpen. 
Sunday, Locke turned the ball 
over to the relievers only to see a huge lead evaporate. O’Sullivan needed six different pitchers to get 
through the final three innings. 
Senior Patrick Keating, who 
came into the season as the Gators’ 
Friday-night starter, continued to struggle in relief of Locke. Keating lasted only one inning after allowing 3 earned runs.
Junior Tony Davis (3-0, 2.03 ERA) 
and freshman Anthony DeSclafani  
(2-1, 3.81 ERA) gave up a combined 
4 runs in two-thirds of an inning, with Vanderbilt tying the game on a 2-run single.
Billy Bullock (0-2, 1.93 ERA), Greg 
Larson and Alex Panteliodis were all used in the eighth, and Vanderbilt junior shortstop Brian Harris punc-tuated the comeback with a two-out, 
3-run homer off Panteliodis. 
On a positive note for UF, the top 
of the lineup was productive in Sun-
day’s loss.  The No. 1 through No. 5 hitters combined to go 10 for 23 with 8 runs and seven RBIs. 
The Gators won Friday’s series 
opener 8-4 behind a two-RBI double from Tucker. UF lost Saturday 4-3 
as Vanderbilt scored the game-win-
ning run on a fielder’s choice in the seventh inning.
UF BASEBALLCommodores score 14 unanswered to stun Gators
Smith, Hartung and Sinclair all posted the 
highest scores for the Gators on uneven bars. Their 9.85s placed them in a five-way tie for second in the event overall. 
Alicia Goodwin, making her first appear-
ance in a regional competition, and team-mate Elizabeth Mahlich trailed just behind with 9.8s. 
Goodwin sprained her knee in practice on 
March 18, three days before the start of the Southeastern Conference Championships, and was pulled from that meet. She was healthy enough to participate in the regional competition on bars and balance beam, the 
team’s closing event.
Heading into beam, UF needed a 49.2 to 
defeat UCLA. UF also felt Iowa State breath-
ing down its neck, as the Cyclones trailed by a marginal 0.8 points.
“We just knew that we had to go out there 
and hit our routines,” Faehn said, though she admitted she didn’t know the score her team needed.
“If I were to know that exactly, it would 
be a little bit nerve-wracking,” Faehn said.
Whether or not the gymnasts knew, it 
didn’t stop the team from going above and beyond the necessary 49.2. UF put on its 
best beam rotation of the season with a meet-high beam total of 49.325.
Hartung again made 
the best of her appear-
ance, putting up a 9.95 
— tying her career best 
and winning the regional beam title nearly a whole tenth ahead of Goodwin’s second-place score.
After falls in the event early in the season, 
Goodwin’s sprained knee seemed to be noth-ing more than a memory as she notched a 9.875 in her third consecutive beam perfor-
mance.
“Everyone that’s out there on the compe-
tition floor is giving 150 percent into it, and 
that’s what’s making the difference,” Faehn said.Hartung ties career best on beam
om beginning to end. Players are smiling, joking and dancing during player introductions, and they seem to appreciate some of the crazy mid-inning festivities for fans, including a 
dance-off.
But it isn’t always easy, even if 
winning breeds happiness. The 20 
student-athletes often play five games in a week, and recent successes have brought a bull’s-eye that isn’t foreign to most UF teams. But these girls can still struggle to always find the joy.
“I think the winning ways are 
almost becoming expectations and becoming part of a businesslike men-tality,” Walton said a few weeks ago. “You can’t argue with the success that they’ve had. I just want them to play with a little more enthusiasm and play with a little more excite-ment.”
The Gators had plenty of excite-
ment Saturday when Kelsey Bruder 
hit her first career grand slam — with 
two outs in the bottom of the seventh inning and the score tied. Sunday was back to the ordinary for UF, with Nelson striking out seven in a three-hit shutout.

Jeff Demps got the baton to start 
the anchor leg of the 4x100-meter re-
lay — with UF already in the lead — 
and the race was over.
As he ran the final 100 meters, the 
crowd roared until he had crossed 
the finish line, giving UF a win in an NCAA regional-qualifying 39.22 seconds on the final day of the Flor-ida Relays held in James G. Pressly Stadium.
After a weather-hampered meet 
in Tallahassee, the home meet proved to be just what UF needed.
The Gators dominated the two-
day event and had athletes earn new personal bests, 39 NCAA re-gional-qualifying marks and school records.
UF’s most dazzling performance 
came in the men’s 4x400 relay, which is traditionally the last event run and UF’s most successful event.
In the fastest heat, UF was chal-
lenged by a team of professionals, but freshman Christian Taylor held off the 2008 Olympic 400-meter hur-
dles and 4x400 relay champion An-
gelo Taylor on the final leg, which threw the crowd into a frenzy.
“It’s not like anybody didn’t ex-
pect us to do that,” coach Mike Hol-loway said.  “When you look at the talent pool we have on this team, we’re supposed to run fast. I think the guys, they’re confident, they be-
lieve in each other, and that’s a re-
sult of what you saw tonight.”
The 4x400 team was composed 
of senior R.J. Anderson, junior Cal-vin Smith, senior Carlos Phillips and Taylor. 
In the 400-meter dash, Smith and 
Taylor battled each other for second and third. Both finished with region-
al-qualifying times, but Smith edged 
Taylor for second place by two hun-dredths of a second. 
Smith added to his outstanding 
performance with another close fin-ish in the 200-meter dash. He took first in 20.68 seconds, a new person-al-best time, while sophomore team-mate Terrell Wilks took second in 
20.70 seconds.The close fin-
ish and compe-
tition between the two has been brewing since practice.
“I didn’t want 
my teammate to beat me,” Smith said. “We prac-
tice every day, and we talk a bunch of stuff, so we just have to show up at the meet.”
On the women’s side, Genevieve 
LaCaze ran a regional-qualifying 4:22.18 to take third in the 1,500-me-ter run and broke the UF freshman record with a win in 10:30.79 in the 3,000-meter steeplechase.
“Doing the steeple for the first 
time, I didn’t know what to expect, but Julie (Northrup, who placed sec-ond) and I had a great time,” LaCaze said. 
UF MEN’S GOLF FINISHES FIRST 
ROUND IN 11TH:  This isn’t exactly 
what the Gators envisioned when they took the course in Atlanta on 
Sunday to play in their last tourna-ment before the postseason.
Before the U.S. Collegiate Cham-
pionship, coach Buddy Alexander 
said the tournament would help set the stage for the Southeastern Con-ference Championships.
If that’s the case, UF’s perfor-
mance this weekend doesn’t bode well for its chances this postseason.
The Gators finished the first 
round of the tournament tied for 11th place out of 15 with a team score of 8 over par.
“It’s disappointing because I 
felt like we were going to get off to a fast start,” senior Billy Horschel said. “We aren’t out of it yet, but we put ourselves in a little bit of a pre-dicament by not playing too good 
today.”
The Gators are 13 strokes back 
of first-place Clemson. Going into 
the event, the team was looking for a golfer to take charge and claim the fifth spot of its lineup, but after Sun-day’s performance, it looks like UF has other things to worry about. 
Only one golfer on the team shot 
under par.Horschel shot 2 under par due to 
his success on the par-five holes. He shot three birdies on the day, all of them coming on par-fives.
“The par-five holes out here are 
the ones you’ve got to take advan-tage of,” he said. “They aren’t too long, so you can reach them in two shots.”
Horschel was the lone golfer to 
have a solid round. 
The other four golfers shot a com-
bined score of 16 over par.
Usually reliable junior Tim McK-
enney shot 4 over par. Although he shot the same number of birdies as Horschel, McKenney struggled with seven bogeys on Sunday.
The Gators will see many of the 
teams from this tournament in the postseason. Nine of the top 10 teams in the nation are playing in Atlanta this week.
“We are just as good as those 
teams, and it’s just a matter of time until we realize it or something clicks with the whole team,” Horschel said.
