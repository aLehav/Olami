Hundreds of UF students and 
local residents lined up all over 
Gainesville on Thursday to get 
tickets to see ﬁ  rst lady Michelle 
Obama when she visits campus next week.
Obama is scheduled to speak 
to grassroots supporters at 3:30 p.m. Monday at the Stephen C. O’Connell Center, according to a press release. Doors open at noon, and the event is free and 
open to the public.
Ticket distribution started at 6 
p.m. Thursday at ﬁ  ve locations. 
Psychology senior Alyssa Free-
man wanted to be ﬁ  rst, so she got 
to the O’Connell Center at 10:23 a.m. and stayed all day.
“I didn’t want to risk the 
chance of not getting to see the 
ﬁ  rst lady speak,” the 21-year-old 
said.
Christian Klepper, a 21-year-
old psychology and history se-nior, joined Freeman to keep their spot at the front of the line.
“I think [Obama] has a great 
personality and is a very power-ful speaker,” Klepper said. “She 
is a prime example of women bal-
ancing family and work.”
Klepper and other UF students 
learned of Obama’s visit when 
the news leaked on Facebook 
Wednesday night. By Thursday night, the line for tickets wrapped around the O’Connell Center and trailed along Gale Lemerand 
Drive.
“Michelle Obama is a class 
act,” said business freshman Ramsey Hamed, 17.
Obama is expected to get lo-
cal supporters “ﬁ  red up,” said 
Duane Gildea, events and servic-
es chair for the Alachua County 
Democrats.
According to the press release, 
the ﬁ  rst lady will discuss the elec-tion’s potential impact on Florid-ians and encourage them to help organize their communities for the campaign.“We want to explode the dem-
ocratic base with excitement here 
in Alachua County,” Gildea said.
Thursday, students in line felt 
that enthusiasm. Some studied, some talked politics — but they 
all waited.
It was time well-spent, said 
English freshman Yareliz Men-dez-Zamora.“People stand in line for days 
just to be one of the ﬁ  rst to get the 
new iPad or Xbox, so I can wait in 
line for a few hours to see the ﬁ  rst

� DISTRIBUTORS GAVE AWAY THE 
PILLS ON CAMPUS LAST WEEK. 
MICHAEL SCOTT DAVIDSON

Bryce Zinckgraf was unlocking his 
bike when she handed him the pills.
The woman approaching him from 
across Turlington Plaza seemed out of 
place — it was 7 p.m., and she carried a 
bright orange sack.
The 20-year-old environmental en-
gineering junior doesn’t usually accept 
handouts, but, thinking it was a coupon, he reluctantly took a ﬂ  ier.
“This strengthens your focus,” the 
woman said and walked away.
Zinckgraf was left confused and 
holding two white packets that rested on top of the ﬂ  ier, each containing a bright orange pill — 770 milligrams of pharma-ceutical-strength cognitive potential.
Tampa supplement company Nex-
Gen Biolabs released AdderRx, an Ad-derall alternative, on Sept. 5. 
Distributors gave away anywhere 
from 5,000 to 8,000 pill samples at each of 10 universities — including UF — na-tionwide over the last two weeks, said CEO Josh Carlucci. 
Marketed as the “perfect companion 
to college students during exam week,” the company’s website claims AdderRx improves cognitive function, focus and mental clarity.
But according to some pharmacists, 
the supplement’s formula of stimulants and nootropics, or smart drugs, could be more dangerous than it is beneﬁ  cial. Student-targeted Adderall 
substitute poses health risks BENJAMIN S. BRASCH

Childish Gambino is gifted in another 
ﬁ  eld, but students can watch him play the 
part of just a rapper on Flavet Field for free 
with Hoodie Allen later this month.
Donald Glover, a comedy actor and 
writer who raps under the name “Child-
ish Gambino,” and Steven Markowitz, aka  
rapper “Hoodie Allen,” will perform at 7 
p.m. Sept. 28 on Flavet Field.
No backpacks, coolers, pets or video-
cameras will be allowed. 
Student Government Productions is 
bringing the two to campus. Vice chair-woman of public relations Evan Galin would not   disclose how much SGP is pay-ing the artists.
“They are both young and in the process 
of becoming really big names, and they    really appreciate their fans, a lot of which are college students, and it is great to see them perform live,” said Galin, a 20-year-
old public relations junior.
She said the concert will be open to the 
public. SGP expects about 4,000 people to at-
tend the concert, which will happen even if 
it rains, she said.
“The fact that UF has a student gov-
ernment that offers free shows to them is something they should take advantage of,” she said.
She said the show will have a laid-back 
atmosphere.
“We want to promote them, promote 
Student Government and the Student Body in general,” she said. “As performers, with 
their lively attitudes, even if you don’t 
know the words, you are still going to have a good time.”

CORRECTIONS
An article in Tuesday’s edi-tion of the Alligator spelled Faereedun’s name incorrectly . A part of the story also mis-identified her gender identity; it should have read, “Faereedun prefers to be described as QT*, where the Q stands for queer 
and the T* is an umbrella term 
for people who do not adhere to the gender binary of male and female and are not in the process of transitioning from an assigned gender to the op-posite gender.”An article in Wednesday’s edi-tion of the Alligator incorrectly

Many students waiting in

filiation, I think it’s a great 
opportunity to be civically en-
gaged,” said Matt Davidson, a

More than 250 people attended 
Thursday’s kickoff of the eighth annual 
Gainesville Latino Film Festival — neces-sitating a second screening of its first film showing.
The first of five free screenings opened 
with an hour of Museum Nights at the Samuel P . Harn Museum of Art. From 6 p.m. to 7 p.m., attendees watched an in-teractive fashion show of festival guest director Nicole Di Rocco’s swimsuit line, featuring six models and various photos of the swimsuits shot in Cuba.
Free wine and Latin foods like green 
plantains, croquettes and Cuban pastries were served.
After an introduction from Di Rocco, 
“PastPort: Cuba — The search for Nicol-ita” was screened in the Chandler Audi-torium.
Ten minutes before the 7 p.m. show-
time, the auditorium reached capacity, and a second screening of the 45-minute 
film was added for 8 p.m. to accommo-
date about 50 extra attendees.
For the fourth consecutive year, the mu-
seum is hosting almost all of its screenings in collaboration with the Latina Women’s League, a local nonprofit that started the festival eight years ago.
The festival used to take place in the 
Hippodrome Theatre.
The league’s president, Victoria Con-
dor-Williams, said a year’s worth of plan-ning goes into producing the festival. It costs about $20,000.
“When we finish this year’s film festi-
val in October, we will have already start-ed planning next year’s,” she said.
UF’s Center for Latin American Stud-
ies provides funding for the festival from a state Department of Education Title VI program grant.
UF’s Center for the Humanities and the 
Public Sphere, the Center for African Stud-
ies and the Center for Jewish Studies also 
sponsor the festival, which marks the start of National Hispanic Heritage Month.
“It’s wonderful to see so many Latinos 
and Latinas in one place,” said Eric Castil-lo, the director of UF’s Institute of Hispan-ic-Latino Cultures. “This is a very small town, and sometimes we can get lost.”
Political science and international stud-
ies sophomore Bobby Brito, 19, came to Thursday’s event because his family im-migrated to America from Cuba.
“If your family came a long time ago 
like mine, it’s hard to get a cohesive pic-ture of what life was like then,” he said.4, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 14, 2012

PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE MITT ROMNEY.
JEWEL MIDELIS
Alligator Contributing Writer
About 25 people gathered Thursday to hear Mitt 
Romney supporters announce the UF chairman on the 
Florida Students for Romney Leadership Team.
Political science senior Frank Moehrle was chosen 
to be the UF chairman for Romney. The 21-year-old said he believes Romney can improve household in-come levels, student loan rates and unemployment. Moehrle said 15 percent of young Americans are un-employed.
“We had four years of President Obama, and he 
tried,” he said. “It obviously didn’t work, and we need a change. I believe Mitt Romney can make that change.”Gators for Romney Communications Director Aus-
tin Swink said Obama has failed average Americans.
“People have lost their jobs and their homes; they 
have to take loans out for college and the future is un-
certain,” the political science junior 
said. “Romney can give a certain 
future.”
Before the speeches, attend-
ees received free Romney T-shirts and bumper stickers. Students also toured the campaign bus, which had granite countertops, marble floors 
and photos of Romney and his run-
ning mate, Paul Ryan.
Biochemistry freshman Anna Shal, 18, came to the 
event upon seeing the bus on campus.
“I want to get more informed on each person’s 
stances,” she said. “I don’t want to take it in from 
someone. I want to find the truth.”UF Florida Students for Romney

AdderRx contains synephrine, a substance banned by the NCAA
Diane Nykamp, a professor of 
pharmacy practice at Mercer Uni-
versity, said she wasn’t able to iden-
tify five of AdderRx’s eight propri-
etary ingredients in a supplement database.
“You don’t know what’s really in 
there,” she said. “And the ingredi-ents in there aren’t safe.”
Two ingredients lacked sufficient 
evidence for their effectiveness in improving cognitive function, she 
said. And the remaining ingredient, 
synephrine, could potentially harm users.
Synephrine is structurally similar 
to ephedrine, an ingredient the Food and Drug Administration banned in supplement products in 2004. Syn-ephrine is also currently banned by the World Doping Agency and the NCAA, said Nykamp.
“Everyone thought synephrine 
was safe,” Nykamp said. “It’s not.”
But the NexGen Biolabs website 
claims that “AdderRx has under -
gone stringent clinical testing and has been proven to be 100% safe,” and that the non-FDA approved supplement doesn’t have the side effects typically associated with Ad-derall.
“There is no dependence with 
this supplement,” Carlucci said.
However, dangerous increases in 
blood pressure and irregular heart rate are side effects shared by both Adderall and synephrine.
“I wouldn’t recommend for any-
one to take it,” said Kristin Weitzel, a clinical associate professor at UF. “‘Clinically proven’ doesn’t have the same meaning as on the side of a Tylenol bottle.”
And those symptoms only get 
worse when combining the supple-ment with caffeine or alcohol, Weit-zel said.
“Great to take before a night of 
partying as well — keeps me bump-
ing until the bars close,” boasts one 
customer in a testimonial on the NexGen Biolabs website.
Carlucci stood by the safeness 
of his product, adding that it’s pro-duced in an FDA-approved facility.
“[Students] should be checking 
the package to see if there are ingre-dients that they might have an ad-
verse reaction to,” he said.Nykamp remained skeptical of 
the supplement’s quality.
“It’s just someone looking to 
make some money fast by using 
similar names,” she said.
She noted that on its free sam-
ples, NexGen Biolabs doesn’t list the amounts of ingredients in each pill.
At UF, students reported seeing 
the product being handed out on 
Turlington Plaza and near Orange 
& Brew. 
But UF spokeswoman Janine 
Sikes said NexGen Biolabs did not apply for a permit to hand out Ad-derRx on campus. She alerted Uni-versity Police to stop the distribution of the product until the company re-ceived a permit.
“They do not have permission to 
be there,” Sikes said.
For some students like Zinckgraf, 
a permit won’t convince them to try the AdderRx samples they received.
“I’ve seen people handing out 
sunscreen before,” he said. “The fact that this was a pill, it made me a little bit uneasy.”
Zinckgraf said he wanted to see 
studies proving AdderRx’s effec-tiveness and safety before consider -
ing taking the pills.
“It doesn’t say much on the la-
bel,” said McKenzie Lentz, a 21-year-old architecture senior. “Con-sidering that it hasn’t been approved by the FDA, I have no idea if it’s safe or not.”
“I took it home and threw it in the 
trash, but other people may want to try that product,” Zinckgraf said. “In a high-pressure environment like college, I think people would be 
willing to take unnecessary risks.”

Ryan Kratt, 19, swing dances with Dani Buchheister, 20, at 
Orange & Brew during RUB’s Great Gatsby dance event.
COLLEEN WRIGHT
Alligator Contributing Writer
Orange & Brew transformed into 
a roaring 1920s speakeasy Thursday 
night, complete with men in sus-
penders and women twirling in trail-
ing lace dresses.
Reitz Union Board Entertain-
ment and the Florida Swing Dancing 
Club hosted the Great Gatsby Swing 
Dance. About 50 people attended.
Long pearl necklaces and neon 
gangster hats were on hand for those who wanted to take part in the theme. 
Flappers and mobsters snacked on 
cheese and fruit while listening to swing music. Most Wanted and Pub-lic Enemy posters lined the walls.
The event began with a swing 
dance lesson taught by the dance club’s president Tyrel Clayton, a 20-year-old English junior. The dance began shortly afterward.
“I was impressed on how rela-tively accurate they got the period,” Clayton said.
The Great Gatsby Swing Dance 
was the concluding event of RUB’s Great Gatsby theme week. RUB’s bands committee codirector Izaura 
Spence said the theme was chosen as 
one of the top four themes preferred by students according to a Facebook poll posted this summer.
“This is deﬁ  nitely the most cre-
ative event that we’ve had,” she said. 
Spence said she was impressed 
with the theme week’s overall turn-out. 
Dani Buchheister, a 20-year-old 
management sophomore, agreed.“It’s a lot of people we’ve never 
seen before, and that’s awesome,” she said.
Buchheister and Ryan Kratt, a 19-
year-old political science sophomore, 
arrived at the swing dance in full 1920s attire. The two have been swing danc-ing for a few months and are members of the Florida Swing Dancing Club, which regularly draws anywhere from 80 to 180 people to its weekly dances.
Kratt and Buchheister discovered 
swing dancing as freshmen and at-
tended their ﬁ  rst lesson together. 
These days, they occasionally 
travel out of the state to attend swing 
dance workshops.
“[Dancing is] kind of something 
we want to do for a really long time,” Kratt said.
Kratt sported suspenders, two-
toned shoes and a faux mustache. Bu-
chheister donned a glitter headband and a sparkling, ﬂ  apper-inspired dress.
“It gets to the point where you just 
want to dance as much as you can,” Buchheister said.Great Gatsby-themed dance draws crowd

67% NOToday’s question: Did you try the AdderRx samples that 
were handed out on campus last week?
Thursday’s question: Do you have health 
insurance with the new health care plan?Rick Scott is Florida’s Public Enemy No. 1
When it comes to treating Florida’s poor like social 
parasites, it’s full speed ahead for Gov . Rick Scott. Reuters reported last Friday that the U.S. Depart-
ment of Labor is investigating radical changes in unemploy-ment insurance recently passed by Scott and the Republican-
dominated legislature.
The investigation is the result of a complaint ﬁ  led by 
the National Employment Law Project, a national workers’ 
rights group, and Florida Legal Services, a state nonproﬁ  t or-ganization, on behalf of unemployed Floridians.
The reasoning for the complaint is simple: The passed 
measures restrict access to unemployment beneﬁ  ts in ex-treme ways. Now any citizen attempting to apply for com-pensation will be required to sign up online, as telephone ap-
plications have been eliminated. Assuming that the applicant 
can afford a computer or is physically able to get to a library, he or she will then be forced to prove his or her intellectual worthiness by taking a 45-question “skills review” of math, reading and research abilities.
But just in case that makes things too easy , the state will 
now also require applicants to provide a personal email ad-dress, adding yet another obstacle for those on the lower end of the digital divide.
On top of that, the New Times Broward-Palm Beach re-
ported that they will have to “ﬁ  ll out forms through snail mail and then wait on hold for hours and hours before hear-ing an automated service that makes them press a bunch of buttons so it can tell them to keep holding, all in order to receive aid.” 
Despite being ignored by even his own party , Gov . Scott 
and his minions, led by Florida Senate President Mike Hari-dopolos and  Speaker of the House Dean Cannon, have spent 
the past two years jamming through draconian legislation 
that attacks workers, the unemployed, students, women, voters and practically every average Floridian.
For example, we have Florida Republicans to thank for 
their concerted war on voting rights, which they waged last year following the passage of several new voter suppression measures, including cutting the time frame for early voting from 14 days to eight. Thankfully , some of these measures have been challenged and struck down, including the imposition of harsh limits on voter registration drives.
However, we can’t forget 
Scott’s now infamous voter purge, through which he has endangered hundreds of legitimate citizens’ right to vote behind the guise of blocking undocumented immi-
grants from the polls.
The U.S. Department of Justice has already sued the state 
government over the voter purge, but evidently Gov . Scott takes some strange, reactionary pleasure in thumbing his 
nose at President Obama and the federal government, wel-
coming the latest investigation of his jobless beneﬁ  ts over-haul with open arms.
After all, these are the kind of actions that his grossly mis-
guided Tea Party base drools over.
Why else would a freshman governor refuse federal 
funds to build the nation’s very ﬁ  rst high-speed rail system, which would have supported a multitude of jobs and jump-started healthy, innovative development of his state’s infra-
structure?
Why else would he refuse to expand Medicaid coverage 
in compliance with the Affordable Care Act or force welfare 
recipients to submit to humiliating drug tests based on a de-bunked falsehood that citizens on welfare are more likely to abuse drugs?
Very simply, it’s all based on conservatives’ delusional 
connection of anything public with the dark machinations of Satan. Is it any wonder our state is a laughing stock in rank-
ings of education, income inequality and a host of other cat-
egories?
If we’re ever to make progress, we Floridians must push 
back against Republicans’ own dark machinations and ad-vance an agenda of constructive investment, not disingenu-ous constraint.

We’d like to start off by thanking the protesting supporters 
of Chris Stephens following the attack in Libya. They stood 
outside with signs proclaiming things like “Chris Stephens was a friend to all Libyans” and other heartfelt phrases. We give a thank-you-for-your-support-and-we-want-to-return-

Whoops. Amanda Bynes, everyone’s favorite Nickel-
odeon starlet, was caught driving around aimlessly with a 
suspended license while smoking a “drug pipe” and eating junk food. Not that we blame her, but she’s had multiple hit-and-runs recently. We give a well-now-the-dancing-lob-sters-make-more-sense DART to Amanda Bynes. Accord-
ing to a police report we just made up, she answered the police ofﬁ  cer’s question if it was actually her driving a car 
while high, by saying,”Thaaaaat’s me!”
Kanye West is one of the most honest rappers today 
(probably). After his condemnation of President Bush a few 
years ago, he said in a new song called “To The World” that “Mitt Romney don’t pay no tax.” While that may not be entirely based on truth, he makes a good point. Where are those darn tax returns, Mittens? We give a thank-goodness-he-put-it-in-a-song-this-time LAUREL to Kim Kardashian’s 
boyfriend.
Do you have a least favorite friend who just shows up at 
parties even though you never invited him, and, in fact, you don’t really even consider him to be your friend? That’s ba-sically who Ryan Lochte is to everyone. He was hired to be a correspondent for New York Fashion Week for E! To which we said “Y?” Whatever. We give a just-leave-without-mak-ing-a-mess DART to Ryan Lochte. Oh, but GO GATORS, 
of course.
New meme alert! Have you heard about “Grifﬁ  ning?” It’s 
the new “Tebowing.” The new trend was created after Rob-ert Grifﬁ  n III, of the Washington Redskins, was tackled just before he threw his ﬁ  rst career-winning touchdown pass. To “Grifﬁ  n,” you must sit on the ground and point your index ﬁ  ngers into the air celebratorily. We give a all-right-but-we’re-not-done-laughing-at-Eastwooding-yet LAUREL to 
RGIII. 
Remember the pink slime scare earlier this year? Well 
now that company, Beef Products Inc., is suing ABC News 
for defamation of their name, claiming that “false and mis-
leading and defamatory” statements were made about its lean beef. We give a stop-making-gross-meat-please DART  
to BPI. Also, your name sounds like a cartoon villain’s meat 
company.
Have a safe weekend, and don’t forget to cheer on the

opinions@alligator.orgLetters to the Editor FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 14, 2012 § ALLIGATOR, 7
Dear Editor,
I am writing to express my extreme dis-
satisfaction with the editorial  “Food Debt” 
printed in your publication on Sept. 6. This editorial, besides containing numerous fac-tual inaccuracies and distortions, was also wildly unfocused and included discussions of issues irrelevant to the matter at hand: America’s rising poverty rate and the re-sulting increase in enrollment in the federal 
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Pro-
gram.
After a brief explanation of the growing 
enrollment in the food stamp program, this line appears in your article: “News of how many people are on food stamps comes with the highest national debt ever recorded: $16 trillion.” This statement seems to imply that SNAP is significantly responsible for the national debt. In reality, the federal govern-
ment spent about $75 billion on SNAP and 
other nutrition assistance programs in 2011, or 2.7 percent of the total federal budget for that year. This number can be compared with the total amount of military spending in 2011 ($712 billion, about 20 percent of the federal budget), or the cost of extending the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy ($229 billion per year). According to your own article, 
this program helped provide sustenance 
to more than 22 million families who oth-erwise would be unable to afford food. If a serious conversation is to be had about re-ducing the national debt, that conversation should not begin with slashing funding for a critical social program like SNAP when more Americans than ever rely on it.
Your editorial also asks whether “gov-ernment spending has coincided with the 
national debt to force hardworking Ameri-
cans to go on food stamps.” Besides appar -
ently asserting that spending and debt are responsible for the weak American econo-my — a claim that has been refuted by the breadth of mainstream economists — you fail to elaborate or provide any reasoning for why this might possibly be the case.
Finally, the article concludes with a com-
pletely irrelevant and tangential discussion about the rising cost of organic food. These closing statements give readers unfamiliar with the SNAP program the false impres-sion that food stamps provide beneficiaries with a “blank check” to purchase any food items they desire. According to a Huff-ington Post article, the average total food stamp benefit is about $4.50 per person per day, just enough for a minimal level of hu-
man sustenance. The price of organic food 
is irrelevant to food stamp recipients, who struggle to provide any food whatsoever for their families.
Overall, your editorial was poorly writ-
ten, riddled with factual errors, and far be-neath the level of articulate and profession-al writing that the UF community has come to expect from your publication. The issues 
which you sought to discuss in this article 
are important and worthy of informed dis-cussion and debate, and I hope that the editorial staff of the Alligator will weigh its statements more carefully in the future. Thank you for your consideration.
Respectfully yours,
Elliot Levy

In September 2011, two unpaid interns for Fox Search-
light filed suit against the major filmmaking corpo-ration for breaking labor laws concerning the work 
they did for the film “Black Swan,” which grossed more than  $300 million worldwide in 2011. This year, their 
lawsuit was expanded to include anyone who has ever 
worked as an unpaid intern for Fox Searchlight.
As I returned to Boston College this Fall as a senior, 
the conversations I have with my friends inevitably turn to the myriad of unpaid internships we took to bolster our resumes and get “a foot in the door” of the working world. From banks to news and radio stations,  in both creative and more technical fields, thousands of students — as well as the newly graduated — do unpaid work ev-
ery year. Most of these students never think twice about 
what this means to themselves and the job market. An obvious Catch-22: Most don’t see an alternative. We do work for free so that we might land a paying job in the future.
One senior I spoke to took an unpaid internship 
from the same popular Internet retail site two summers in a row, even though it meant no stipend for housing or commute and working up to 50 hours a week. Most 
people I spoke to agree that the overall internship expe-
rience is more about resume 
building than anything, and while office experiences can be meaningful and are not especially tolling, doing work 
for free still feels exactly as it sounds: like free labor. At ages 21 and 22, clocking hours in offices while doing the same jobs as full time, paid employees can feel a bit de-
grading. 
The biggest hang-up for many, I’ve found, is not in 
the internships at startups or nonprofits that probably 
couldn’t afford the extra staff and therefore give their interns meaningful responsibilities, but rather with the bigger corporations like banks and investment firms who could easily afford to pay interns at least minimum wage. Massachusetts labor laws state that an unpaid in-tern must receive the same training that would be pro-
vided in an educational environment but may not do 
any work that advances the company in any way. To me, it sounds like many companies have no problem taking on unpaid interns to do menial office tasks that do not necessarily advance them as a company, but at the end of the day, provide little to no educational advancement for the intern, creating a lose-lose situation for interns who are not getting paid or learning anything. Is the re-sume boost worth it? I often asked myself this question 
while working a perfectly comfortable, but trivial, un-
paid internship in Milwaukee this summer, especially as it meant fending off high-paying nannying jobs. At BC, where graduation is dependent on classes rather than credits, taking an internship for the latter is no real solu-tion to a sticky modern problem. What is the solution, then? While I don’t really have an answer to this loaded question, I know I can’t be the only one who thinks there has to be a better way.

Numbers from the Sept. 7 Bureau of Labor Statistics 
jobs report are just another one of the many pain-ful reminders of the recent economic collapse and 
ensuing recession.
In the month of August, three times as many workers left 
the job market as found jobs. There was no wage growth, 
and the vast majority of jobs gained were low-paying, and 
most were jobs serving alcoholic drinks, indicating a trend toward escapism. This is the fourth month in a row of dis-mal jobs numbers that on the surface seem hopeful (the un-employment rate fell from 8.3 percent to 8.1 percent) but are discouraging when you look into them.
This begs the question: Why is the economy still so bad? 
Our president is very fond of saying that Republican presi-dential candidate Mitt Romney and the Republicans want to 
“take us back to the policies that got us in the mess in the 
first place.” What typically follows is empty rhetoric about letting Wall Street write its own rules and cutting taxes for the 1 percent. That all sounds great, but that’s actually not what got us here.
A bunch of people bought houses and got mortgages. The 
banks then gambled with these mortgages, packaged them up and invested on them in a very risky way. When some people defaulted on these mortgages, the whole thing went 
south, some banks failed, companies laid employees off, the 
ailing auto industry was hit by a lack of demand and the whole economy cascaded into stagnation.
Once the initial shocks hit, everything imploded, and a lot 
of weak sectors and companies were shaken up. But I don’t buy the supposed root cause: Greedy Wall Street investment bankers took risky investments.
The housing market has been the 
surest bet in the American economy since the ’50s. Home values have al-ways consistently increased, accord-
ing to U.S. Census data, and people typically try to pay their mortgages because they need a place to live. 
The real cause of the recession lies in people living beyond 
their means. Government programs such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac made it easy for low-income people to get low-interest loans, whether they were qualified for them or not. There’s no deeper-rooted American value than property ownership, and these programs reflected the great intention to give everyone a shot at owning a home. They did this by 
creating a secondary mortgage market for mortgage-backed 
securities, which would then increase the attractiveness of mortgages for banks to incentivize lending to low-income or even no-income people. Some people just weren’t good can-didates to take on the debt that comes with owning a home and financing a mortgage. They defaulted on their mortgag-es en masse, which started the vicious cycle we’re in today.
Romney and the Republicans want to rectify the problem 
of living beyond our means. Entitlement reform is crucial to 
this goal. If we stay on this course of borrowing 40 cents of 
every dollar we spend, according to North Dakota democrat-ic Sen. Kent Conrad, we will eventually default on our debt.
We need to practice budget austerity, otherwise the entire 
U.S. economy will follow the trajectory of the housing mar -
ket with consequences to scale.

◗ GAINESVILLE COMPOST SAVES 
240 GALLONS OF FOOD WASTE FROM LANDFILLS WEEKLY. 
ANGELA TEGNELIA
Alligator Contributing Writer
A year ago, a company bloomed 
with a simple idea: Bike from house to 
house collecting compostable materi-als.
That company, Gainesville Com-
post, is giving away some food grown by its compost to celebrate its one-year anniversary. The event will be from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. Saturday at Tempo Bis-tro To Go, 1516 NW 13th St.
“The idea is to close the loop by 
turning waste back into food,” said Chris Cano, CEO of Gainesville Com-post and 24-year-old UF alumnus.
Gainesville Compost is a bicycle-
powered composting service that ped-als to its partners and picks up their 
food waste for free to be used for com -
posting. Gainesville Compost currently 
works with 12 businesses and diverts an average of 240 gallons of food waste from landfills each week.
“I really support everything they’re 
doing,” said Jennifer Larrick, A 19-year-old applied physiology and ki-nesiology and psychology sophomore. 
“It’s a cycle that just makes sense.”
John Drum, owner of Tempo Bistro 
to Go, said his business was among the 
first to work with Gainesville Com-post.
“By composting and creating the 
garden,” he said, “I know that the veg-etables I’m eating are truly organic in  shape and form.”Composting company

Students interested in walking to raise mon-
ey for Alzheimer’s research can still sign up.
Several UF-affiliated organizations will par -
ticipate in the annual Walk to End Alzheimer’s 
event Saturday at 10 a.m. on Bo Diddley Com-
munity Plaza. Students can sign up on the 
Alzheimer’s Association website, act.alz.org/site/TR?pg=entry&fr_id=1309.
Proceeds from the event will be split be-
tween research and nearby support programs. The association aims to raise about $80,000 from donations. Volunteers do not have to pay to participate.
The city has hosted the walk for 15 years. 
Katie Garro, development manager for the Central and North Florida Chapter of the Al-zheimer’s Association, said the event has taken place at Haile Plantation and Westside Park in the past.
“Now that the walk is closer to campus, 
we’re hoping more students get involved,” she said.Although there are clubs and organizations 
already participating, students can walk indi-vidually as well.
Lindsay Avila, a 20-year-old anthropology 
junior, said she encourages students to get in-volved with the walk.
“The reality is that many people, students 
included, will one day either face Alzheimer’s themselves or will know someone with the dis-
ease,” she said. “If we do all we can right now, 
then maybe one day we can help change the future for countless individuals.”
The walk will take place rain or shine, and 
participants can choose a one-mile route or a three-mile route. Garro said about 600 people are expected to walk.Organizers seek more students

About 200 UF students 
herded through a cargo truck 
on the Plaza of the Americas on Thursday.
The truck housed the Flor -
ida Modern Slavery Museum, a traveling exhibit funded by the Coalition of Immokalee Workers and parked on the plaza for about four hours while curious students mean-dered by.
The exhibit showcased 
memorabilia that documented 
labor abuse in the past decade, particularly abuse against mi-
grant workers in farmland-rich Immokalee.
Among the collection was 
a bloodstained shirt — a re-minder of the punishment a worker received when he 
paused for a drink of water in 
2007.
“I’d heard about workers 
being exploited, but I didn’t realize it’s so prevalent,” said Toni-Lee Maitland, a 20-year-old history junior. “It shocked me.”
Marley Moynahan, an ex-
hibit staff member, said the truck is a replica of the vehicle used to confine Immokalee laborers during off-the-clock hours in a slavery case docu-mented in 2008.
Eric Castillo, director of 
UF’s Institute of Hispanic-La-tino Cultures, said labor abuse 
affects students, because they 
consume food harvested by abused workers.
“We are all directly tied 
to this issue,” Castillo said, tapping a photo of a farm-worker’s wrists, swollen from being chained in a truck by his employer overnight.
“I literally didn’t know this 
was going on,” said Jaime Es-tes, an 18-year-old marketing freshman. “The more people that know, the quicker it will stop.”Traveling slavery museum

UF Lacrosse Adds New Assistant
Nick Williams joined Amanda O’Leary’s staff as an assistant coach on 
Tuesday. Williams was an assistant coach for Notre Dame’s women’s lacrosse team for two years, coaching defense and goalkeepers. New men’s tennis coach Bryan Shelton makes his home debut this weekend in Gainesville. See story, page 14. alligatorSports.org
Keep an eye on our site this weekend as the crew travels to Knoxville to cover Florida’s game against Tennessee on Saturday.  ADAM PINCUS
Alligator Staff Writer
 
Florida will face a daredevil 
in Knoxville, Tenn.
Gators cornerback Marcus 
Roberson called Volunteers 
quarterback Tyler Bray just that due to his tendency to take risks down the field. Florida quarter -
back Jeff Driskel isn’t one to take too many chances through the air, instead putting himself in harm’s way with his feet.
In two games, opponents 
sacked Driskel a Southeastern Conference-high nine times, while Bray completed eight passes of more than 20 yards, 
including a 72-yard touchdown 
to Zach Rogers in the season opener against N.C. State.  
“He can throw the ball deep 
as good as anybody,” Driskel said of Bray. “They’re not scared to throw the ball a lot. I would, too, with those receivers 
they have and their playmaking 
ability. But he’s a good quarter -
back.”
The No. 18 Gators hold a 
seven-game winning streak 
against their SEC East Division 
rival and will try for No. 8 at 6 p.m. on Saturday. 
The last five Florida start-
ing quarterbacks before Driskel —  John Brantley, Tim Tebow, 
Chris Leak, Ingle Martin and 
Rex Grossman — averaged 263.8 yards, two touchdowns and a 63.4 percent completion 
percentage in their first starts 
against Tennessee.
With the Volunteers ranked 
No. 24, Saturday’s matchup will mark the first time since 2007 
both teams rank in the top 25 at the time of their meeting. 
If Driskel can avoid absorb-
ing too many shots from the 
Volunteers defense, the Gators will have a chance to extend 
their winning streak another 
year. 
“We just don’t like to see 
our quarterback getting hit,” center Jonotthan Harrison said. 
“We’re just going to make sure it doesn’t happen anymore.”
Both teams won their first 
two games, but with different 
offensive game plans. 
Tennessee outscored its 
opponents by 52 with a high-powered vertical attack. Florida toughed out two victories by an average margin of eight points per game.Another week, another road trip

After the staff received good ole 
southern hospitality in Texas, alliga-
torSports takes its talents to Tennessee. 
Looking forward to some um... what do 
they even have in Tennessee?
For one reason or another, ESPN’s 
College Gameday decided to follow the 
Gators for the second week in a row. 
This time to the Tennessee campus for 
their matchup against the Volunteers.
But we don’t pay attention to ESPN 
unless they’re talking Tebow, so let’s get 
on to the picks! Josh Jurnovoy and Joe 
Morgan debate the Notre Dame-Michi-gan State matchup in Lansing, Mich. 
Michigan State (-6) will be immune 
to the luck of the Irish because…
The Spartans are bitter and will be 
out for blood. As part of the Big 10, they are a member of an exclusive high 
school clique that invited the cool-look-
ing loner, the Fighting Irish, to join the 
gang. But they were shocked when the 
loner went to the less popular group, the Atlantic Coast Conference. 
With just one meeting guaranteed 
beyond this year, Michigan State will want to ensure it doesn’t lose to Notre 
Dame in the last matchup in Spartan 
Stadium for the foreseeable future.
- JOSH JURNOVOY
The sons of Notre Dame (+6) will 
rally onward to victory because...
Michigan State is a basketball school. 
Notre Dame is a football school. Deal 
with it. 
Entering his third season as The Man 
in South Bend, Ind., it’s time for coach 
Brian Kelly to put up or shut up. The 
Fighting Irish are ready to return to the 
glory days, and it’s time for everybody to hop on Kelly’s ark — er, bandwagon.
In conclusion, Touchdown Jesus!

Redshirt senior Betsy Smith is the only 
player who was around for the end of Flor -
ida’s last era of dominance. 
With Smith watching from the bench 
during her redshirt season in 2008, the 
Gators captured the last of 18 straight Southeastern Conference regular season 
championships.
While Florida remains an SEC power -
house — its 19 SEC titles are 14 more than 
the five each won by tied second-place schools Kentucky, Tennessee and LSU  — the gap appears to be closing. 
During the last six seasons, the Gators 
have lost 11 SEC games, compared to only 
seven in Mary Wise’s first 
15 years as UF’s head 
coach. 
Florida is 53-7 during 
Smith’s career, including an SEC title in 2010, but 
LSU claimed the champi-onship in 2009 and Ten-nessee secured it in 2011, 
providing a challenge to nearly two de-
cades of UF dominance. 
This year’s Florida squad is in danger of reaching a new low: going two consecutive 
seasons without an SEC championship. 
The No. 13 Gators (6-2) will be looking 
to start their journey back to the top when 
they play their first SEC match against Ar -
kansas (9-2) tonight at 8 in Fayetteville, 
Ark. 
Florida will then travel to Lexington, 
Ky., to face  No. 24 Kentucky (6-4) on Sun-day at 1 p.m.
“To start the SEC with this challenging 
road trip is not going to be easy for our team,” Wise said. “It’ll be a great test for 
this young Gator team.”Gators begin conference play in tougher SECsee Football, P age 15

MEN’S TENNIS
  MAX MATTERN
 Alligator Writer
   
 Raised in Alabama, new men’s tennis coach Bryan Shelton 
was instilled with the simple southern values he has kept with 
him all of his life. 
  “I appreciate opening up the door to somebody ,” Shelton 
said. “I appreciate showing respect to everybody .     I like that 
about the south. I just feel very comfortable in this environ-
ment.”
  Shelton played tennis at Georgia Tech for four years and 
coached the Yellow Jackets’ women’s team for 13 years, which included a national championship in 2007.
  He left Georgia Tech as the winningest tennis coach in 
school history.
  With ties dating back to his college years and the perfect 
location, only one or two schools could lure Shelton away. 
   “Florida was one of those schools I always put at the top of 
the list,” Shelton said with a smile.  Shelton believes Florida is one of few programs that can sup-
ply him with the assets he needs to build a successful team.
  Florida enters the year ranked No. 12, but the Gators have 
not been able to get over the hump the past few years.
UF has   competed in the NCAA Tournament every year 
since 1997, but they have not advanced past the Sweet 16 since the 2004-05 campaign.
  Shelton knows some changes will have to be made for his 
team to accomplish its goals.
  “You’ve got to instill your own values and your own stan-
dards into the program,” Shelton said. “There’s going to be some changes when you have turnover.”
  Junior Mike Alford has already seen the difference with 
Shelton at the helm.  “Practices are a little bit different. You know, it’s kind of ex-
citing to come to practice now,” Alford said. “The coaches are enthusiastic, and we all like them.”
  The chance to take Florida’s program from great to elite was 
one of the selling points that attracted Shelton to the job.
  “There’s a lot of things that drew me here,” Shelton said, 
“Knowing there is opportunity to move this program forward, that we’re not at the top yet, and that we can make an impact in doing some things that have never been done here before is certainly attractive.”
  Florida competes in the Bedford Cup today through Mon-
day at Linder Stadium. This will be a chance for the team to 
work on one of Shelton’s two goals for this season, which is 
getting better every day.
  The second is simple, too: Win the Southeastern Conference 
championship.
  “We want it all; we’re greedy. We want championships,” 
Shelton said. “That’s our aim, and that’s what we are shooting for.”  Shelton bringing new values, goals to Florida’s program
SEC play brings physical test
  Wise said the Gators’ nonconference 
opponents, including two top-10 teams, 
have prepared her squad for league play  
— the more hostile and aggressive part 
of the season.
  Smith said competing against confer-
ence teams requires an entirely different 
mindset than playing other schools.
  “The SEC is a really physical confer-
ence so we’re going to see a lot of things 
we haven’t seen,” the team captain said. “It’ll definitely be different for some of 
our younger players that haven’t experi-
enced that type of animosity before.”
  On the other side of the spectrum, 
freshman Berkley Whaley is preparing 
for her first SEC game. 
The outside hitter from St. Petersburg 
said she feels prepared for the new chal-
lenge.
  “It’s going to be a new transition be-cause it’s the SEC,” she said. “It’s here. 
This is what we’ve all dreamed about es-
pecially as a freshman. The coaches are all preparing us and the upperclassmen. When we’re in practice, it’s such a good environment that I think we’ll carry it 
into the match.”
  When the Gators travel to Fayette-
ville, it will be their first true away game 
of the season. Then Florida will head to 
Kentucky.
  The Gators are 
32-2 and 44-10 all-time against the 
Razorbacks and Wildcats, respectively. 
However, Wise said she expects a chal-
lenge, as each team is in its prime with nine combined seniors.
  “I’m sure we will be in for a battle,” 
she said. 
“(They) have players who can score 
points. This is their year with all their re-turning players. But everybody starts the SEC 0-0.” VOLLEY , from page 13

the road for the ﬁ  rst time, realizes 
he doesn’t have to make every play 
with his feet.
His eagerness to extend plays 
got him in trouble at times against 
Texas A&M last week. 
“Don’t be scared to throw the 
ball away and live another day,”   Driskel said. 
“I’ve got to learn from that, took 
too many sacks, and most of them 
were on me, so really learning to 
throw the ball away and get the ball out quicker.”
  While Driskel admitted he held 
onto the ball too long, coach Will Muschamp saw it as another oppor-tunity for Driskel to improve.  “When you take the progression 
read and you read to the ‘Z,’ to the ‘Y,’ to the however the progression is based on the play, sometimes you do get locked in and hold it a little 
long to see if some guy is going to 
come open as opposed to taking it to the next progression. That’s a very natural part of the process,” Muschamp said. “The game will 
slow down for him as we move for-
ward.”
Offensive coordinator Brent 
Pease added: “More reps and being in that situation where the crowd is on you and the other team, the more he gets (of that), the better he’s go-
ing to get. That’s for anybody out 
there.”
  Despite the sack issues in Col-
lege Station, Texas, Harrison saw a young quarterback ready to handle 
a hostile environment.
Driskel shook off the hits and en-
gineered a key fourth-quarter drive 
that included a 21-yard rush to run 
out the clock.
  “The thing about him is he can 
keep the plays alive with his feet 
since he is mobile,” Harrison said. “As he gets more comfortable, may-
be gets some of the jitters out, I feel 
like he’ll have a great season and produce.”

RBSS FSwent for my neck!” Jurnovoy, who was victimized by a few over-
zealous crickets while walking from Kyle Field to the our parking spot last Saturday night. Man up, Josh! 
  Currently in second with a 10-6 record is The Miami Herald’s 
Matt “The Bully” Watts, who tried to get revenge on his high school tormenters by hiding a colleague’s lunch at a media availability this 
week. Hold back those tears, Watts. No amount of stolen Chick-ﬁ  l-A

  Headlining third place at 9-7 is The Associated Press’ Mark “Are

if you’re going to try it, you have to be all in. Also, owning an NFL 
franchise helps. You Khan do it!
  Also in third place is alligatorSports online editor Adam “Boiled-

as soon as his ﬂ  owery suitcase was safely stowed. Once he arrived

The Gators know the impor -
tance of an early lead.  
Florida was 4-8 last year 
when allowing its opponent to 
score first, but undefeated in 13 contests when it struck first on the scoreboard.  
Unfortunately for the Gators, 
the issue of slow starts carried over to 2012. Florida scored first against Florida International, but allowed opponents to take early leads in four of six matches. 
The only positive for UF was 
winning two of those games. 
“Ideally, we’d not like to 
get ourselves in those deficits,” coach Becky Burleigh said. “We’ve just got to be a little bit better at not giving away free chances.”No. 22 Florida (3-2-1) will be 
looking to strike first when it begins Southeastern Conference play against Kentucky (5-1) to-night at 7 in Lexington, Ky.
In 10 matches during the past 
two seasons, UF’s opponent scored the opening goal in the first 12 minutes.
The beginning minutes of 
any match are tricky and frantic, senior Erika Tymrak said. 
“We just have to be disci-
plined, maybe take 10 minutes at a time in the games,” she said. “In the first 10 minutes, let’s just set a goal for ourselves, instead of looking at the whole game.”
Senior Holly King said the de-
fense needs to play smarter and more organized in the game’s 
opening moments. 
“Once you hear the first whis-
tle, everyone wants to go after 
it,” King said. “It’s important for us to dictate the game.”
The Wildcats have only al-
lowed four goals in six contests, but will miss Kelsey Hunyadi, who led the team in goals (14) and assists (10) last season. UK 
upset then-No. 25 Louisville 2-0 
on Friday but fell to Samford 3-1 
on Sunday. 
Burleigh said she expects 
Kentucky to play with an ag-
gressive style similar to that of 
New Mexico. 
The Gators fell behind to 
the Lobos twice on Sunday but 
eventually won 3-2.  
“It’s a quality to have to be 
able to come back,” Tymrak said. “But if we could prevent that all the time and maybe only (have it) happen once in a while, that’s really what we’re working for.”16, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 14, 2012

First-year head coach Paul 
Spangler graduated from Ala-
bama. He also received a mas-
ter’s degree from Florida State. However, when the opportunity arose for the homegrown Flori-da boy to become the leader of UF’s cross country teams, he took advantage of it.
On Jan. 25, Florida hired 
Spangler as its cross country and assistant track coach, ending his 
10-year tenure in the same posi-
tion at the Virginia Military In-stitute. 
“When the University of 
Florida offered me the job, it was something I certainly couldn’t pass up,” Spangler said. “Coach-ing at VMI was an extraordinary experience that not only helped me become a better coach, but 
a better recruiter. That’s some-
thing that will certainly help me here.”
Spangler understands the bar 
is set high for Florida after it won its first outdoor track and field championship in the spring.
“Here at Florida, you’ve 
got to be good,” he said. “You 
should be in position to win [a 
Southeastern Conference] cham-pionship and certainly do well at national championships. So, the expectation is there. There’s no doubt I’m going to bust my butt and help the athletes bust 
theirs, so we can have the suc-
cess that the University of Flori-da expects.”
The men’s team returns all 
five of its leading point scor -
ers from the 2011 squad, which 
competed at the NCAA Cham-
pionships. They were picked in the SEC Preseason Coaches Poll to finish second in the SEC this 
season behind Arkansas.
The women bring back two 
runners who qualified individu-
ally for NCAAs last year — se-nior Florence Ngetich and junior 
Cory McGee. Florida was pro-
jected by the coaches poll to fin-ish the season in third place be-hind Vanderbilt and Arkansas.
Spangler knows that before 
any conference championships 
are won, teams have to stay 
healthy.
“That’s half the battle,” he 
said. “If you touch on all the 
energy systems throughout the 
season, you’ll see them get bet-
ter. That will help them stay stronger and injury-free.”
The men’s and women’s 
teams will compete in their only home meet of the season Satur -
day at the 24th annual Mountain Dew Invitational at the Mark 
Bostick Golf Course. The men’s 
8K starts at 7:55 a.m., while the women’s 5K begins at 8:30 a.m.Spangler bringing new
