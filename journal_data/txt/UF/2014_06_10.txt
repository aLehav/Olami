Children of undocumented immigrants 
can now qualify for in-state tuition in Flor-
ida.
House Bill 851, signed into law by Gov. 
Rick Scott on Monday, grants in-state tu-ition to undocumented students who have attended a Florida high school for at least 
three years and plan to enroll in college 
within 24 months of graduation. 
For students like Jose Abastida, this 
means a $22,278 drop in yearly tuition. 
When Abastida visited UF in high 
school, he fell in love with the campus. But as an undocumented immigrant, he knew he couldn’t afford the out-of-state tuition. 
“But with this bill passing, everything 
fell into place,” he said. “It was perfect tim-ing.”
Now that HB851 is law, the 22-year-old 
will attend UF in the Fall as a political sci-ence junior.His sister can now afford to be a full-time 
student, he said. Before, she was limited to one to two classes per semester. 
Jose Miranda, former president of the 
Hispanic Student Association, said this is a big deal for Florida because this state has the third largest population of undocu-mented immigrants, following California 
and Texas. 
However, the students granted the low-
er fee are ineligible for state ﬁ  nancial aid.

Emails conﬁ  rming your online order may 
be used for another food delivery service 
Gainesville2Go said on Friday, bringing to light a recent email list breach. 
A  list was allegedly obtained about a 
month ago by ex-manager of Gainesville2Go Jeremiah Loper after he exported the customer email list from a third-party email provider. 
“He has his own business,” said current 
manager of Gainesville2Go, Jackson Bodiford. “We let people know in case he uses the list.”
Gainesville2Go and Bodiford haven’t no-
ticed much of a change in business since the release of the reported email, and there is no security risk with the exported list.
“A handful of customers have requested 
their card info to be deleted, which takes 10 seconds,” Bodiford said.
The company’s plans to alleviate any nega-
tivity is being “digged into,” and a few sug-gested promotions will be in place for the Summer semesters.
However, there have been some problems 
with the company in the past, according to Alligator archives. On April 4, 2013, about 
8,000 customers received an explicatory email 
from the delivery company apologizing for a profanity-ﬁ  lled email. The message was a re-venge tactic sent by a former employee who was later ﬁ  red. The former employee was able to log into the company’s Facebook, email and 
Twitter accounts where he posted apologies. 
An arrest was also made for fraudulent 
checks being forged on Jan. 3, according to 
archives. Michael Tatum, a former employee, wrote $40,000 worth of fraudulent checks. Loper and owner of Gainesville2Go, Andrew Gorrelick, reviewed business records when they noticed a series of forged checks, the ﬁ  rst check being dated Dec. 2, 2013. Tatum’s expla-
nation was that the company was an “open 
business” and employees wrote their own paychecks from the main business account.Although Loper was ﬁ  red six weeks ago, 
Bodiford and the company decided to change some security measures. 
“We instantly changed passwords and 
bank passwords within the software,” Bodi-ford said. “Jeremiah had access to that email service. He’s the one who set it up in the ﬁ  rst 
Gainesville2Go email list allegedly taken by former employeeALEX HARRIS

UF has hired 37 professors, 
who may begin as soon as this 
Fall, as part of the university’s preeminence drive.
Last year, the Florida Legis-
lature allocated UF $15 million annually for ﬁ  ve years to help the university become a top 10 public university, an amount President Bernie Machen pledged to match with private donations.
“We felt we couldn’t use 
it on facilities,” Machen said 
during a Board of Trustees 
meeting Friday. “From the very beginning, this has been a faculty-driven process.”Last Summer, the universi-
ty sought out proposals for ar-eas of preeminence study from deans and institute directors. 
They received 52 “well-
thought-out” proposals and 
narrowed it to 26 initiatives 
that would build on UF’s cur-rent research as well as “new trends on the horizon we can’t afford to overlook.”
UF committed more than 
$18 million to the 26 initia-tives, dwarﬁ  ng its, at the time, $15 million in preeminence 
funding. 
“We assumed, kind of like 
airline scheduling, that we 
would overbook,” Machen said. “We were encouraged by UF hires 37 faculty

loud music will face a second 
murder trial after jurors at his original trial deadlocked on the charge, a judge decided Monday.Michael Dunn, 47, will be tried again starting Sept. 22 in the shooting death of Jordan Davis, 17, in an encounter at a 
Jacksonville gas station, Circuit 
Judge Russell Healey said.In February, a jury deadlocked on a first-degree murder charge but convicted Dunn of three counts of attempted murder for shooting at Davis’ compan-ions.Witnesses said Dunn com-

the court to review cases in 
which smokers won large damage awards without hav-ing to prove that the com-panies sold a defective and dangerous product or hid the risks of smoking.Those cases all relied on a Florida court ruling that al-

been ﬁ  ghting for this bill for 
years. 
“Seeing this bill come to 
fruition is really rewarding,” Miranda said. “For a long 
time, we thought we were go-
ing to lose the ﬁ  ght.”
He said similar bills have 
been debated, but none have landed on the governor’s desk until now. 
This will affect many of the 
members of HSA, Miranda said. 
“I hope it opens the door 
for ambitious students to at-tend UF,” he said. 
The decision is effective 
July 1, allowing students who qualify for this bill to begin in the Fall semester. “This is a small step that the 
governor can take to address a signiﬁ  cant issue for young La-tinos and Latinas who could contribute a lot to the state,” said Latin American expert 
and UF religion department 
chair Manuel A. Vásquez.
UF Student Body President 
Cory Yeffet said Student Gov-ernment helped the bill move forward by traveling to Tal-lahassee numerous times to show its support.
“Student Senate was very 
integral in passing the resolu-tion for this bill,” said the 21-year-old UF real estate gradu-ate student.
He said UF is pleased with 
the governor’s decision. 
“It shows how students can

the quality of the proposals and the 
breadth of the proposals.”
Luckily for the university, Flori-
da’s 2014 budget included an extra $5 million for UF’s preeminence 
campaign. 
The initiatives include topics 
like big data, cyber security, renew-
able energy and storage, social net-work analysis and online learning. UF has hired professors in 15 of the 26 initiatives.
Machen said UF expects to have 
40 faculty acceptances by July 1, 
with 50 to 60 more hires in the next 
ﬁ  scal year.“The idea was to hire midcareer 
and distinguished professors that 
could immediately contribute to 
their ﬁ  eld of research,” he said.
Machen said his team decided 
against hiring junior faculty, cit-ing the time it would take for less-experienced faculty’s research to mature. 
Meanwhile, UF’s $800 million 
preeminence plan, of which $285 
million has been raised this year, 
has been divvied up as well. 
The plan, which aims to fund 
faculty endowments, allocated $8 million going to undergraduate support, $21 million to research, $140 million to program support, $85 million to faculty support, $17 million to graduate support and $15 
million to campus enhancement.
Provost Joe Glover called this an 
exciting and chaotic period for the 
university.
“We moved from a period of 
recession where the university did almost no hiring at all to a period where suddenly the deans found that they were having to interview 
one or two people every day,” he 
said.
This has led to some faculty 
grumbling, but Machen doesn’t seem concerned.
“That’s the kind of complaint I 
like to hear,” Machen said.BOT , from page 1

place.”
Kate Burns, a 20-year-old UF English junior, wasn’t 
concerned about the email from Gainesville2Go.
“I did receive one,” Burns said. “I think it was in the Fall semester. Ever since then, I was wary about it.” 
As a freshman, Burns said she liked the service be-
cause it was convenient. 
“It was quicker to get it myself,” Burns said. “I haven’t 
used it in a while.”
Burns said she is being careful on what information 
she gives out. G2G , from page 1TUESDAY, JUNE 10, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 5

UF does not plan to expand 
health care coverage for gradu-
ate assistants, UF administra-tors told graduate assistants on Thursday.
Administrators refused 
Graduate Assistants United’s proposal that asked for vision and dental coverage for the teaching assistants, citing a deﬁ  cit in GatorCare. 
“Compared to other pro-
grams both in and out of Flor-ida, you have a very robust 
plan,” UF Board of Trustees 
head of bargaining Bill Connel-lan told the 15 union members during Thursday’s bargaining meeting. 
The union contended the 
proposed UF raised premium rates for graduate assistants as well, which includes a $409 increase per employee for the 2014-2015 school year, accord-ing to GAU records.
Administrators said Ga-
torGradCare speciﬁ  cally is estimated to be more than $1 
million in deﬁ  cit, forcing UF to 
raise the premiums. 
Graduate students said 
they were upset they were not consulted before the change in price. 
“It’s like, rip out the IV 
ﬁ  rst, ask questions later,” said 29-year-old GAU chief nego-tiator and co-president Emily McCann. 
Administrators consulted 
an outside accounting ﬁ  rm but said they had no data to show for it.
“I think it was just number 
crunching,” Connellan said.
McCann said she is unhap-py that UF raised rates with-out presenting justiﬁ  cation through data.
The union also raised is-
sues with UF administration’s recent handling of disciplinary procedures in which graduate assistants have been tried by both the Dean of Students Of-ﬁ  ce and Employee Relations for the same issue.
“I should not be tried twice 
on campus,” said 29-year-old sociology Ph.D. candidate Luis Caraballo-Burgos, who took over for McCann as chief nego-tiator for GAU after the meet-ing. “It takes up a lot of time, and it costs us a lot of money.”
She said graduate assistants 
straddle the line between stu-
dent and employee.
“We need to have those dif-
ferent parallel processes very 
clearly spelled out,” McCann said.
Associate history professor 
and former graduate assistant Paul Ortiz spoke up for the graduate students on behalf of 
the United Faculty of Florida.
“We completely support 
GAU’s bargaining position,” 
he said. 
He said UFF would like 
to see the end of all graduate fees. 
“We depend on graduate 
assistants as fellow intellec-tuals. Paying for the right to work takes away from that,” he said. 
In the face of preeminence, 
the university’s goal of becom-ing a top 10 public research university, UF administrators should work to end the fees, Ortiz said. 
“We want to become a top 
10 university,” he said. “It’s the right thing to do.”Graduate students

A plant experiment designed by 
two UF researchers returned from 
the International Space Station last week.
After orbiting the Earth for two 
weeks on a NASA cargo ship, the plants have touched down safely at Kennedy Space Center, where they were returned to UF research-ers. 
Anna-Lisa Paul and Robert J. 
Ferl, the two researchers who de-signed the experiment, are study-ing the effect light has on root growth in zero gravity.
The seeds, Arabidopsis, were 
grown in a petri dish, Paul said.  Arabidopsis is considered the 
model seed for plant experiments, 
said Eric Schultz, a 25-year-old UF 
graduate student studying plant molecular and cellular biology un-der Paul and Ferl.
There are two factors that cause 
root growth, light and gravity, but gravity tends to overshadow the role light plays on root growth.
“We want to see how much 
of an inﬂ  uence light has on roots grown without gravity as a factor,” Schultz said.
The plants returning from outer 
space are going to be compared and analyzed to seeds grown on Earth on June 11. 
“We’re looking at the pattern of 
gene expression in novel environ-ments,”  Paul said. “Space ﬂ  ight is outside evolutionary history.” 
The plants will have to adapt to 
this new environment, which can be difﬁ  cult because of the differ-ent atmospheres, said Karen Koch, 
a UF researcher and professor in 
plant molecular and cellular biol-ogy. 
“It’s very hard for them to 
maintain air pressure as on Earth,” 
said Koch.  
This experiment will show how 
plants can adapt in space, which is 
vital for space exploration because plants are essential for extended exploration. 
“When we leave Earth’s orbit, 
we will take plants with us,” she said.UF experiment returns from space

Politicians aren’t 
smarter than scientists
It’s easy to shut down arguments about environmental 
policy made by scientists. In fact, it only takes one word: 
“alarmist.” 
It’s what Republican politicians, particularly Gov. Rick 
Scott, Sen. Marco Rubio and former Gov. Jeb Bush, use to de-rail arguments about rising sea levels in Florida — an undeni-
able reality, PBS Newshour reported. 
Rising sea levels around the world are connected to global 
warming, scientists said. National Geographic reported that 
“the burning of fossil fuels and other human and natural ac-
tivities has released enormous amounts of heat-trapping gas into the atmosphere.” As a result, three factors have contrib-
uted to the increase of sea levels, thermal expansion, the melt-
ing of glaciers and global ice caps and ice loss from Greenland 
and Antarctica.  
Ice loss in areas thousands of miles away has an immedi-
ate effect on South Florida. According to PBS, “‘This is not a 
future problem. It’s a current problem,’” said Leonard Berry, 
director of the Florida Center for Environmental Studies at 
Florida Atlantic University and a contributing author of the 
National Climate Assessment, which found that sea levels 
have risen about 8 inches in the past century. 
And yet, even as Miami is poised to spend $400 million 
on “an elaborate pumping system to cope with routine ﬂ  ood-
ing,” Marco Rubio claimed that surface temperatures on 
Earth “have stabilized.” 
PolitiFact Florida was quick to debunk his statement. They 
ruled it “Mostly False.” 
In his original statement, he said he never denied that cli-
mate change was a reality. However, he said, “How much is it changing and how much of it is directly attributable to hu-man carbon emission? There is no consensus on that, which 
is why the models vary so greatly, which is why, despite 17 
years of dramatic increases in carbon production by humans, surface temperatures (on) the Earth have stabilized.”
Scientists weighed in, and while surface temperatures have 
paused the increase over the past 16 or 17 years, the devil is in the details — “stabilized” implies that the worst is over. 
All the experts PolitiFact interviewed, who represented 
NASA, the University of Miami, Rutgers and more echoed the same sentiment: The rate that the globe has been heating will pick up again, and stabilization won’t occur for another 
10 or 20 years. The Earth’s temperatures haven’t stabilized at 
all — they’ve simply paused. 
Politicians regularly cherry-pick facts to support their 
agenda. That’s why we have organizations like PolitiFact, af-ter all. But when will Rubio and other Florida politicians stop positing themselves as experts in the ﬁ  eld of environmental 
studies, listen to what the real researchers are saying and start 
creating policy? Florida needs the kind of $400 million proj-ects that Miami is undergoing, but it also needs a solution 
for the long term. Those solutions won’t come as a result of 
denial and false senses of security. Obama and the Bergdahl dilemma 
The president is the ultimate victor-victim: The policies 
Obama proposes that should win the White House easy political victories are the situations that always 
lead to his defeat. 
For example, advocating more Americans have health 
insurance, proposing big government solutions and con-demning our enemies on the world stage — all positions that are popular with a large group of Americans — have led to the mess that still is Obamacare, an expanding bu-reaucracy that adds the recent Veterans Affairs situation to a growing list of scandals and the indifference of our foreign foes. These are victories in the planning stages but defeats in practice.  
The Bowe Bergdahl ﬁ  asco adds to Obama’s victor-vic-
tim status. By all accounts, retrieving a captured prisoner of war from barbaric captors should have been a home run, and the administration treated it as such. The administra-tion felt so good about what they did that they organized a presidential spike-the-football Rose Garden press confer-ence with the soldier’s parents. 
In order to spread the good news of this joyous occasion, 
the administration sent National Security Adviser Susan Rice to the Sunday show circuit. 
Rice said on ABC’s “This Week” that Bergdahl “served 
the United States with honor and distinction” before he was “taken in battle” by the Taliban. To get him back, the ad-ministration engaged in a prisoner exchange. 
The terms of the exchange? Five of the, as Sen. John Mc-
Cain put it, “hardest of the hardcore,” Taliban ﬁ  ghters held in Guantanamo Bay for one American POW. Now this be-gins to complicate the feel-good narrative.  
Surprising to the administration, bipartisan groups of 
politicians began to question the terms of the transfer. And just as that debate was heating up, Sgt. Bergdahl’s charac-ter came under increasing scrutiny. The soldiers he fought with before his capture now question his sense of the mis-sion and claim that he sought out the Taliban by himself, challenging Rice’s talking points. 
Add on top of that, the White House bypassed a 30-day 
notiﬁ  cation of Congress rule in the event of a prisoner ex-change, and there is no way a vic-tory can be salvaged for the White House. 
Here is what we have learned: 
First, no matter what one’s politi-
cal persuasion is, the cliche that 
the U.S. never leaves a man be-hind still stands. It does not mat-ter if the sergeant in question went AWOL, criticized the war he was 
ﬁ  ghting for or learned the language of his captors: Bergdahl is an American citizen. This country promises our service-men and women that in the event of being taken captive by the enemy, the nation will get our own back. 
Inevitably and rightfully, Bergdahl will be subject to a 
military tribunal where he will face the consequences of his actions.  
Second, those who seek harm upon our country now 
have an incentive to capture Americans and have expected terms of exchange: ﬁ  ve of us for one of yours. Time maga-zine quoted a Taliban operative in saying, “It’s better to kid-nap one person like Bergdahl than kidnapping hundreds of useless people… Now everybody will work hard to capture 
such an important bird.”
And third, it is doubtful that a prisoner exchange was 
the only option to reclaim Bergdahl. Sending in a group 
of special forces to retrieve him would not be unsound considering we are still ﬁ  ghting a war in that region with a good amount of troops on the ground. Even the apolo-gists for the administration have to admit that “President Drone-Strike” might have had intelligence on the sergeant’s whereabouts.   
In sum, the president was right to get Bergdahl back 
to this country. However, the process in which he was re-turned is unfortunate. In getting our man back, we released ﬁ  ve dangerous enemies of state into one of the most dan-gerous regions in the world, and the administration bucked the rule of law in the process.

opinions@alligator.org TUESDAY, JUNE 10, 2014  ALLIGATOR, 7
For those of you who are 
bad at remembering dates, here’s a reminder: 
Father’s Day is this Sunday. 
Now, I love my dad, and 
I’m more than happy to have a day dedicated to him. But I’m not interested in having any more fathers in my life — which is why birth control is so important to me because I don’t want to make fathers out of any of my part-ners.
However, birth control can be ex-
pensive and inconvenient if it requires a prescription. And despite some great side effects of hormonal birth control — hello, clear skin and bigger breasts — it could interfere with health issues.
On the bright side, there’s a contra-
ceptive method that’s free, convenient and, as far as preventing pregnancy goes, about as effective as condoms.
If your high school sexual education 
was anything like mine, your freshman biology teacher probably told you nev-er to just “pull and pray.”
The good news is that your sex-ed 
teacher was wrong: You can have sex. You probably won’t die. And the pull-out method is a very real birth control option.
For those who don’t know what the 
pull-out method is, I’ll explain. Also known as withdrawal, the pull-out method is when the male pulls his pe-nis out of the vagina right before ejacu-lation.
After that, he can come on his part-
ner’s breasts, butt, face or anywhere, really, that is not her eyes, hair or sen-
timental childhood stuffed animal, 
please and thank you. 
According to a new study put out 
by the Guttmacher Institute, “One-third of women at risk of unintended pregnancy used withdrawal as a con-traceptive method within the past 30 days.”  
The study focused on women and 
found that college-age women, those ages 18 to 24, are actually the most like-ly to use withdrawal. Women rely less on pulling out as they get older.
This makes sense. From what I’ve 
seen in my own life and in my friends’ lives, the pull-out method is used most-ly as a last resort. I don’t see most 30 year olds getting too drunk from Marga-rita Mondays to ﬁ  nd a condom. 
But that’s what 
makes the pull-out method so great. All out of condoms? Forget to take your birth control pill? 
Just pull and pray. 
It’s reassuring to know that when 
you do that, the rate of pregnancy pre-vention is pretty high. 
Typical use of the pull-out method 
has a failure rate of 18 percent, which is about the same as the condom fail-ure rate of 17 percent, according to the Guttmacher study. Perfect use of pulling out and condoms results in a 4 percent and 2 percent failure rate, re-spectively.
The big drawback to the pull-out 
method is that it doesn’t protect against sexually transmitted diseases. As such, I recommend using it only if you and your partner trust each other, have gotten tested and know each other’s sexual history. 
Using a condom, and maybe, a 
backup form of birth control, is still a good idea when you’re hooking up 
with that Tinder match whose last 
name you don’t even know. 
It’s also important that the guy can 
control himself when using this meth-od. It’s a bad idea to rely on pulling out if you usually ejaculate prematurely. 
The gentleman also needs to stay 
mindful during sex. It’s easy to get lost in how good things feel, but you need 
to pay attention enough to actually 
know when to pull out. 
I still encourage you to explore oth-
er birth control options. Part of having responsible sex is taking ownership of your sexual health. The pull-out meth-od is a great backup, but consistent contraceptive use is the safest option.
So make sure to protect yourself 
against unwanted pregnancy, whether that means pulling out or using anoth-er form of birth control. 
And send your dad a Father’s 
Day card. He’ll thank you on both ac-counts.

opinions@alligator.orgOn May 29, the Gainesville chap-
ter of the National Women’s Liberation wrote an aggressive 
opposition to Florida HB1047/SB918, 
regarding the termination of pregnan-
cies. 
In the article, the chapter claimed that the bill 
reduced women to “walking incubators,” among 
other outrageous assertions. As a woman, this ar-
ticle was disturbing to me, not because I felt my 
rights to abortion were being compromised, but 
because their claims of the bill’s purpose and effect were completely false. 
Pregnancy can be terminated, and there is noth-
ing vague about the bill’s language: A woman may 
have an abortion in the ﬁ  rst trimester and even the 
second trimester of her pregnancy. When the third trimester arrives, however, the bill inserts a cau-tious protocol for doctors to assert whether the fe-
tus could live outside the womb. If so, the planned 
abortion is logically and humanely put into ques-
tion. An abortion in the third trimester is still an option if two physicians agree that the termination is “necessary to save the life or preserve the health 
of the pregnant woman.” 
What the bill does not do is allow for a reckless 
termination of a baby that is alive and capable of 
living outside of the womb because the mother has whimsically decided in the third trimester that she 
doesn’t want to have it. The NWL has also argued that the 
bill will “erode women’s rights even 
further with future changes in medical technology. This is an unfair assump-
tion to make. The viability of a baby is 
deﬁ  ned as whether the fetus can live 
outside the womb under standard medical proce-
dure. This means that while some babies have the potential to survive in the second trimester with 
extra medical help, an abortion may still be per-
formed. 
This is not good enough for the NWL. They are 
ﬁ  ghting for the right to have a baby aborted at any 
time during a pregnancy using the defense of an 
abortion being the woman’s decision at all costs. 
This is wrong. 
The Florida Legislature is not perfect. However, 
this is a bill that has passed with bipartisan sup-
port, and two of the House bill sponsors are doctors 
themselves. The Senate version was even pushed 
through by two women. The main purpose of this 
bill is to provide a reasonable second look when determining the fate of a fetus. An organization like the National Women’s Liberation would have 
better luck if it knew the facts about the ideas it is 
protesting against. Stop disguising third trimester 
abortions as a “woman’s right to medical care.” 
When another human life is at stake, a humane 
approach will and should rightfully be taken.

Lake Wauburg incident raises ex-Gator concerns
On a recent Saturday, I took the bus down to a fa-
vorite haunt, Lake Wauburg. It was a gorgeous day, 
weather-wise, and I was excited about revisiting the beautiful facility and pristine lake, as I had done with a friend a few months earlier, enjoying a nice picnic 
lunch with a spectacular view.
I approached the admitting booth, only to ﬁ  nd I 
was not allowed to enter due to the lack of a Gator 1 
Card. I protested that this had not been required on my previous visit. The attendant sympathized but said it was policy and there was nothing he could do. At my request, he gave me the number of the admin-istrative ofﬁ  ce, but the woman who answered only reiterated his position. I responded that I would not 
stand for this kind of treatment of a loyal UF graduate 
who had contributed six years of student activity fees to the university and would contact UF President Ber-nie Machen to discuss the matter. Three days later, his secretary shufﬂ  ed me off to some guy in the Student Affairs ofﬁ  ce, and nothing ever came of it.
So, I put it to you, current UF students: Is this fair? 
Will you stand with me on this, in order to get this 
nonsensical, discriminatory policy changed for an old 
ex-Gator? I help you guys out and sign your petitions all the time. I’ll edit and proofread your papers for you, if you want. Frat boys and sorority sisters, here’s a little project for you.
I am on campus at Krishna Lunch on the Plaza of 
the Americas just about every weekday wearing my badges and riding my bike with the stickers all over it.
A Vietnam veteran was with me that day, and he 
was turned away too. He was understandably furi-ous that a man who had proudly served his country could not get in to see a damn lake.
Remember: The same thing could happen to you 
someday.

When the Ku Klux Klan announced 
a rally, an anti-racist group took to the Alachua County Courthouse. A few skinheads showed up to this rally, as 
two of their peers were being arraigned 
for battery charges after an April beating of a local black man. One of them said there was a need for an all-white nation because Americans need somewhere to call home, to which an anti-racism ral-lier called, “You ain’t American. You’re scum.”
June 8, 1993Students might be able to get cash, 
buy food and clothes, have long-distance phone sex or go broke buying the lat-est infomercial wonder products — but when it comes to paying tuition, they better bring cash. UF was considering not accepting VISA or MasterCard for tu-ition payments. At the time, credit cards were allowed, provided an additional 2 percent fee. However, the credit card companies themselves had rules prohib-
iting adding any such surcharges. The 
payments accounted for about 12 per-cent of $80 million of tuition collected. 
June 12, 2001A judge shot down pleas from two 
Florida groups to declare a ban on releas-ing autopsy photos to the public uncon-stitutional. The issue became relevant af-
ter the Orlando Sentinel requested to see 
the photos of recently passed NASCAR driver Dale Earnhardt. More than 33,000 people signed a petition to prevent pa-pers from having access to those photos.

Broward Hall’s major renovations, which 
began in 2011, will be finished next sum-
mer.
This five-summer project has an expected 
cost of $24 million, wrote Sharon Blansett, as-sistant to the associate vice president for Student Af-
fairs, in an email. The ren-
ovations include replacing 
the windows, doors, locks and flooring; refurbishing the bathrooms and loung-es; and upgrading the fire sprinkler, alarm system and electrical systems.
Blansett said that the renovation will not 
affect students or faculty at UF because it is necessary for building upkeep.
“Renovations and repairs to residence fa-
cilities are ongoing and planned many years 
in advance,” she said.
Blansett said the contractors are chosen 
through a competitive bidding process. This 
summer’s contractors are Charles Perry Partners Inc., BBI Construction Manage-ment Inc. and Oelrich Construction Inc., which are all local contractors.
Taylor Bosco, a 20-year-old UF music 
education junior, lived in Broward Hall for two years. She said she loved living in Bro-ward because she met a lot of good friends.
Fixing up Broward will only make it 
nicer, she said, and more enjoyable for resi-dents.
Bosco said she remembers people work-
ing in the hall last year, but she didn’t think too much about the renovations because they are just making the building better.
“I loved the location because it’s so 
convenient,” she said. “It’s right by every-thing.” Broward Hall’s lengthy renovations to be finished by 2015ERIN MEISENZAHL-PEACE

Demonstrators gathered in the 
heat, fanning themselves with their 
picket signs. 
“What do we want? Fair pay!” 
shouted the line of about 30 people 
along University Avenue. “When 
do we want it? Now!”
The members and supporters of Amalgamated Transit Union’s local chapter rallied in front of City Hall before a city commission meeting on Thursday, continuing to lobby for pay progression for Gainesville Regional Transit System workers.  
“We’re trying to make it so every-
body don’t have to work so hard to make so little,” said RTS employee Terrance Dix. 
Most RTS transit operators make 
$12.63 per hour, said president of lo-cal ATU chapter 1579 Mary Frances Folz Donahue.  
“They advertise you can make 
up to $16.92, but there’s actually no way to progress,” she said.
Compared to peer agencies in ar-
eas like Palm Beach and Jacksonville, Gainesville RTS operator wages are the lowest, according to data from the National Transit Database.
Folz Donahue said this is why 
RTS has a retention problem. “Our turnover rates are sending 
our drivers to Jacksonville,” said 21-year-old UF political science and 
history junior Steven Houston, who 
interns for the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial 
Organizations.
ATU will attend a public hearing 
at 10 a.m. on Wednesday to negoti-ate a final proposal. 
RTS spokesman Chip Skinner 
could not be reached for comment. 
Houston said he is hopeful about 
the outcome because Gainesville res-idents rely heavily on public transit.
“If the city supports students, 
they’ll support ATU,” he said. RTS workers continue the push for clear pay progression 
“We’re trying to make it 
so everybody don’t have to 
work so hard to make so 
little.”

This weekend was a busy one as coaches held the first ses-
sion of Will Muschamp’s football camp. In Friday’s 7-on-7 
tournament, Booker T. Washington wide receiver Antonio Calloway was on campus participating in the tournament. Cal-loway has named Florida as his leader and Miami as a close 
second.
Clemson wide receiver commit Deon Cain represented 
Tampa Bay Tech’s team — coaches are still actively recruit-
ing him despite his commitment. The four-star wideout also played quarterback, safety and cornerback on Friday. Per his Twitter account, was on his way to Clemson yesterday.
Saturday’s session of camp was chalk full of UF commits 
and targets. Safety commit Deontai Williams out of Trinity Christian Academy participated, and offensive lineman Tyler 
Jordan was on campus to watch the camp.
“I really came to watch how coach Summers coached, and 
see if it was the same as he did in practice,” Jordan said. “I 
wanted to pick up a little bit of technique stuff and absorb what I could from his teaching.”
Jordan was also on campus to recruit UF targets, including 
three star offensive linemen Abdul Bello and Jalen Merrick.
“I like their work ethic. They’re hard workers and they’re 
not really that flashy but they’re all good kids,” Jordan said.
Jordan, who plans to visit UF again when big name recruits 
are on campus over the summer, hopes that UF has the same feel to targets as it did for him during his recruitment process.
“When I visited both times before committing, I felt at 
home. I kind of felt it was a place that I really fit in well with other players,” Jordan said. “I also love coach Summers. He’s a great coach and a great teacher. I really like coach Roper and what he’s doing with the offense—and I really like coach Mus-champ.
Jordan also says last season’s 4-8 record didn’t give him much hesitation when committing to Florida in February.
“I thought about it a little bit,” Jordan said. “But they had 20 
plus injuries, and when you’re playing second and third team guys against SEC starters it’s going to be hard to win.”
Jordan was seen talking with four-star quarterback Sheriron Jones on Saturday, and can get some credit for recruiting him as UF landed a verbal commitment from Jones on Sunday af-ternoon.

Kelsey Stewart’s season may not be 
over just yet.
Two days after Florida won its first 
national championship in program his-
tory, the Amateur Softball Association 
announced that Stewart and former 
Gators softball player Michelle Moultrie accepted invitations to participate in the USA Softball Women’s National Team Selection Camp.
The four-day camp, which began 
Monday in Lynchburg, Va., will be fol-lowed by three exhibition games. The national team will be announced on June 
22.
Stewart, the third UF player in pro-
gram history selected to tryout for the national team, is coming off a record-
breaking sophomore season. 
In 2014, the Wichita, Kan., native set 
UF’s single-season record with 102 hits and tied her program-best 36 stolen bases. Stewart also started the season by 
reaching base in 41 consecutive games, 
shattering Moultrie’s program-best mark of 37 set in 2011.
Stewart also holds Florida’s career-
best batting average with a .408 clip at the plate through her first two years.
Florida’s leadoff hitter also led the 
Gators in the majority of its offensive stats in 2014, including batting average 
(.438), hits (102), runs (68), stolen bases 
(36), triples (six) and doubles (14, tied with Aubree Munro) en route to first-Stewart, Moultrie honoredbAsebAll

After a disappointing ending to an other-
wise successful season, Florida had six of its 
11 eligible players selected in the MLB Draft – two on Friday and four on Saturday.
Juniors Taylor Gushue and Justin Shafer 
were the first two Gators off the board, re-spectively. 
The Pittsburgh Pirates took Gushue, UF’s 
starting catcher for the past two seasons, in the fourth round with the 131st overall pick. Just more than 100 picks later, the Toronto Blue Jays selected Shafer, a 6-foot-2 right-handed pitcher/outfielder, in the eighth round with the 234th overall pick.
The Blue Jays announced coming to terms 
with Shafer on Sunday, but the team did not release the details of the signing. However, Shafer’s value based upon his selection in the draft is estimated to be about $159,900, according to Baseball America.Blue Jays director of amateur scouting 
Brian Parker said the organization will at-tempt to use Shafer as a full-time pitcher 
rather than have him pursue a future as a 
position player.
“(Shafer is) a guy we like and who’s re-
ally come on in the second half of the year,” Parker said to MLB.com. 
Gushue, who is expected to come to terms 
with the Pirates before MLB’s July 18 sign-ing deadline, has a pick value of $388,800.
Although Gushue, who took over as 
catcher after Mike Zunino was selected third overall by the Seattle Mariners in the 2012 MLB Draft, is expected to forego his senior season in Gainesville, Pittsburgh’s general manager Neal Huntington said the “signability” of players is not a top deciding factor when in the draft room.
“Signability never drives our selections,” 
Huntington said. “We make them based on Six Gators taken in MLB Draft

It was an important year for Florida.
Bringing in one of the largest and best recruit-
ing classes in the country, an 18-3 season and a 
fourth straight NCAA Quarterﬁ  nals appearance, 
the Gators couldn’t have asked for a better start to what many have called Florida’s rebuilding year.
Coach Amanda O’Leary said all season that 
Florida’s success fell into the hands of players like Shannon Gilroy, Nora Barry and Krista Grabher. But if you asked anyone on the Florida roster, it all came down to O’Leary’s coaching.
On Friday, O’Leary was named the Inside La-
crosse Women’s Coach of the Year.
The award came after O’Leary helped lead Flor-
ida to its fourth consecutive American Lacrosse Conference regular title, second ALC tournament 
title and fourth trip to the NCAA Quarterﬁ  nals in 
just ﬁ  ve seasons.
The ﬁ  fth-year coach has earned the honor of IL 
Women’s Coach of the Year in three separate sea-sons. O’Leary ﬁ  rst won the award in 2011 when she 
led the Gators to their ﬁ  rst ever NCAA Quarterﬁ  -nals appearance.
In 2013, O’Leary was awarded the honor once 
again after the senior-laden Florida squad made yet 
another quarterﬁ  nals appearance.
Five of O’Leary’s players were also honored by 
Inside Lacrosse.
Freshmen Caroline 
Fitzgerald, Sammi Burgess, Taylor Bresnahan and Mollie 
Stevens were named to the IL 
Women All-Rookie team.
But it’s been Gilroy who has racked up all the 
awards during the postseason. Gilroy has been named to the IL Women’s team and a Lacrosse 
Magazine All-American.
She was also nominated for a Tewaaraton Award 
for the 2014 season and was one of four ﬁ  nalists af-ter she ﬁ  nshed the year with a single-season record 
in points (106) and goals (86).
At the end of the season after hanging on to a 
top-ﬁ  ve spot in the Brine Media Poll and only los-
ing to UNC and Syracuse in the regular season, 
Florida showed the lacrosse community that the 
team wasn’t rebuilding, just reloading.14, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, JUNE 10, 2014

UF coach Amanda O’Leary calls a timeout during an exhibition game 
against Rollins College on Oct. 2, 2010 at Donald R. Dizney Stadium. O’Leary has earned ILWomen’s Coach of the Year three times at UF.
UF Lacrosseis the No. 10 ranked quarterback in the 2015 class. With 
Jones’ commitment, Florida’s 2015 class moves up as the 21st class in the country, according to Rivals.com. The 2015 recruiting class now has nine verbal commits.
Florida already has a verbal commitment from four-
star cornerback Marcus Lewis, who attended the 2014 Rivals Challenge in Baltimore this past weekend. Also in attendance was ﬁ  ve-star defensive end CeCe Jeffer-son from Baker County High School.

Stewart only improved in the 
postseason, posting a .471 batting 
average with two RBIs and ﬁ  ve runs in the Women’s College World Se-

Florida’s single-season records with 
a .519 on-base percentage and .443

Other notable players attending 
the selection camp include Florida State’s Lacey Waldrop, the 2014 USA Softball National Player of the 
Year whose 1.13 ERA was the third 
best in the country; Alabama out-ﬁ  elder Haylie McCleney, who paced the Southeastern Conference in bat-ting average (.444), on-base percent-age (.556) and runs (70); and Oregon pitcher Cheridan Hawkins, a south-paw who led the Ducks with a 1.66 ERA and recorded 330 strikeouts in

JACKSONVILLE — Jozy Alti-
dore ﬁ  nally scored a goal.
He had a disappointing sea-
son at club team Sunderland af-
ter only scoring two goals in 40 
appearances in the English club’s 
2013-2014 season. Altidore had also been held scoreless in his last 28 competitive games.
In the 32nd minute of the US 
men’s national team’s 2-1 vic-tory against Nigeria, the striker tapped in a one-touch pass from training camp roommate Fabian 
Johnson to break through for the 
United States’ ﬁ  rst goal of the afternoon. Johnson’s last four as-sists in national team play have all gone to Altidore.
In the 68th minute, Altidore 
struck again after he received a Michael Bradley pass over the top, shook off a Nigerian defend-
er and ripped a shot into the goal. 
In a true striker’s mentality, after the game, Altidore said at that point he thought a shot was bet-ter than a pass to teammate Clint Dempsey — and he turned out to be right.
“It’s a wonderful message to 
see that Jozy put the thing in the 
net,” coach Jurgen Klinsmann 
said. “It gives him a big smile at the right time . . . (the goal) will give him a lot of conﬁ  dence. It’s always a tough period when you don’t score for a striker.”
For Altidore — who earned Man of the Match honors — it was two much needed conver-sions for a team that will need all its players in top form to make it out of Group G when World Cup play starts for the US on June 16 against Ghana. Conventional wis-dom says pressure would have built around a player whose job it is to score doing everything but Altidore shrugs that notion off.
“I’ve had the pressure since I 
was 16, so it comes with the terri-tory,” he said.
Altidore said the goal makes “no difference,” and he had been working to help the team in other ways during his drought.
But while the players were 
in Jacksonville, they had people helping them off the ﬁ  eld. On Fri-
day, the men’s national team met 
with members of the military and exchanged dogtags. They also had a welcome reception with military members as well.
Altidore wore his tags around 
his neck to the postgame press conference, an accessory that accented his patriotic look that 
featured a shirt adorned with 
the American ﬂ  ag and socks that sported a stars and stripes pat-
tern.
“This is probably the best gift 
I’ve ever gotten,” Altidore said. 
“It means a lot to me to know that what we do affects people that serve our country today.”
The US now has its eyes 
squarely focused on the target ahead — Ghana. There are no 
more open friendlies or tune ups. 
Training camp is over and to the relief of Klinsmann, none of his players sustained any injuries.
They leave American soil to 
travel to Brazil and face “the group of death.” Doubts hover ominously about whether or not the team can even get out of its 
group. The talk is nearly over and 
ﬁ  nally people will be able to see for themselves. And an in-form Jozy Altidore could give them a bit more optimism to fuel that fandom. Jozy jump-starts men’s national team in ﬁ  nal sendoff game

JACKSONVILLE — A 24-year-old man  
remains in critical condition as of Monday 
evening at UF Health Jacksonville after fall-
ing 42 feet from the stands onto the con-course outside of section 244 of EverBank 
Field. 
Cuidy Joseph fell during the US’ 2-1 vic-
tory over Nigeria, the US men’s national team’s ﬁ  nal sendoff game before heading to Brazil for the World Cup. 
The incident happened around 6:54 p.m., which was just minutes before the second 
half of the game was due to start. 
Joseph fell back-ﬁ  rst directly onto his 
right shoulder on the concrete surface be-
low the stands next to several concession stands.
Eyewitness accounts given to alligator-
Sports said Joseph was coherent after his fall with no external bleeding.
Stadium medical staff attempted to get his attention while he was lying on the 
ground and the man was responsive, nod-
ding his head and breathing per eyewit-nesses. He was mobile and “wiggling his arms” as paramedics took him out of the stadium per eyewitnesses as well.
Jacksonville Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce added via 
Twitter on Saturday night “no foul play is suspected at this time” and that the “victim does not appear to have been drinking.”Fan falls 42 feet from stands in EverBank Field at US friendly
