Eights months after the 
Florida Innovation Hub at UF 
opened its doors, the startup center has seen about 100 jobs 
created and $7 million raised 
in private investments.
Innovation Hub director 
Jane Muir credits the center’s 
early success to entrepreneurs, employees and students who are investing their talents in Gainesville. She said UF and Santa Fe College students are taking full advantage of the 48,000-square-foot business incubator and its resources.
“They’re getting involved 
in all kinds of ways,” she said. “Some of them are founding companies, some are intern-
ing and some are working for 
us.”
Glenn McGraw, 27-year-
old CEO and co-founder of Gamedayr website, said with-out Innovation Hub, Game-dayr wouldn’t have been able to grow. Due to resources and ofﬁ  ce space the Innovation Hub provided his business, he has added more employees and interns to his staff.
The website covers college 
gameday culture, including the SEC, the ACC and the Big 12.
Innovation Hub has space 
for about 30 businesses, ac-
cording to Alligator achieves. ASHIRA MORRIS

A new dining option is rolling 
onto campus.
La Lola Loca, UF’s ﬁ  rst food 
truck, is in the middle of its ﬁ  rst 
week serving Latin fare to go.
On Tuesday, the lime-colored 
truck covered in images of fresh 
produce and tropical ﬂ  owers 
pulled up to UF’s campus and  stationed itself between Grinter Hall and the University Audito-rium.
Tyler Peters, a 21-year-old psy-
chology senior, parked his black bike to order a chicken Lola’rito.
“In my four years here, I 
haven’t seen anything like it,” Peters said.
The Gator Dining food truck, 
whose name translates to “The Crazy Lola,” serves lunch on 
campus from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. 
Monday through Friday.
Similiar food trucks exist at 
University of Alabama, Universi-
ty of Tennessee and Florida State 
University.The truck sold its ﬁ  rst meal 
Monday, parked behind the Rac-quet Club dining center.
Students can purchase food 
with their Gator 1 Cards, in addi-tion to cash or credit payment, Jill Rodriguez, marketing program manager for Gator Dining, wrote in an email.
The Latin menu includes mod-
ern versions of burritos, tacos and quesadillas.
Carolyn Dampier, the execu-
tive secretary in the Ofﬁ  ce for Re-search Information Services and Publication, met co-workers from 
Walker Hall and Grinter Hall to 
grab a quick lunch.
The chicken bowl she ordered 
was her ﬁ  rst food truck meal.
“It’s something different and 
convenient,” she said.Food truck brings Latin ﬂ  air, mobile dining options to UF

UF received new solar panels 
that will act as a teaching aid for 
students while saving the univer-
sity thousands of dollars a year.
Progress Energy Florida gave 
the university a 100-kilowatt so-
lar photovoltaic array for free 
through the SunSense Schools so-
lar energy program, which aims to provide renewable energy ed-ucation to Florida students.
The solar panels will capture 
the sun’s rays and turn it into en-ergy. 
The system will generate 
157,000 kilowatt-hours a year 
and will reduce electricity costs 
by $15,000 a year, said Robert Sumner, a spokesman for PEF.
                                     This will allow the university 
to generate its own power and step away from other energies. 
The system costs about $65,000 
and will allow the university to 
generate its own power and step away from other 
nonrenewable 
energy.
The panels 
will be installed by Nov. 30 in 
three locations on campus.
They will be south of the 
Microbiology and Cell Science 
building, University of Florida’s 
Energy Research and Education Park and between the Rinker-School of Building Construction and Broward Residential hall.Anna Prizzia, director of UF 
Ofﬁ  ce of Sustainability, said this shows the university’s commit-ment to sustainability.
“It’s an opportunity to use a 
solar energy as a teaching tool 
in classes and research,” Prizzia 
said.
Rinker School of Building Con-
struction students will learn how 
to install the units as if they were 
working for a solar construction company.     Allison Goldberg, a 19-year-old environmental geosciences 
sophomore, said she believes 
the campus is going in the right direction with the installation of the solar panels.
     “Everyone knows what solar 
panels look like, but not what they do,” she said. “The solar panels will show that the cam-pus is changing.”Money-saving solar panels will 
be installed by end of November“In my four years here, I 
haven’t seen anything like 
it.”

A UF assistant professor recently received 
about $240,000 to do research in Haiti.
The National Endowment for the Humanities 
awarded Benjamin Hebblethwaite, who works 
in the Department of Languages, Literatures and 
Cultures, $240,804 — the second-largest award it 
gave in Florida this year.
Creating the “Archive of Haitian Culture and 
Religion: Collaborative Research and Scholar-ship of Haiti and Haitian Diaspora” is a collab-orative academic effort led by Hebblethwaite. His co-director is Duke University’s Laurent Dubois.
During the project, Hebblethwaite will ob-
serve and document the voodoo religion in Hai-ti. Collecting songs used in rituals is one of the project’s goals, he said.
“Many Haitians, some French anthropolo-
gists and others have gone to Haiti and recorded songs and transcribed them,” he said. “One of the major parts of this project [is] to gather and preserve this sacred literature of the voodoo reli-gion. That’s the part that interests me the most.”
When Hebblethwaite learned he had won the 
award this summer, the project’s focus was on collecting texts and interviews with priests and practitioners. 
Since then, Hebblethwaite and his colleagues 
have realized the importance of a new type of media — audiovisual materials.
“The text is sort of like a snapshot divorced 
from real ritual. Likewise, a photograph is an 
instant in time,” Hebblethwaite said. “But voo-
doo is movement. It’s a danced religion. It’s a drummed religion. It’s a sung religion.”Richard Freeman, an assistant librarian at UF, 
will travel to Haiti with Hebblethwaite to collect audiovisual accounts of voodoo ceremonies. He said he thinks the pair will get there by Novem-ber 2013.
Though new to voodoo and the religious as-
pect of anthropology, Freeman said it’s exciting.
“It’s what some academics would refer to as 
a ‘sexy topic,’” he said. “It’s got that bit of exotic-ness to it. It’s something more seriously that has not been studied that seriously by academics, or it has been but by a small group.”
With ceremonies lasting up to 10 hours and 
the technology needed to ﬁ  lm only recently be-coming available, Hebblethwaite said the audio-
visual aspect of the project is a new approach to 
studying Haitian voodoo. 
Hebblethwaite and Freeman will record as 
much as they can for any researchers who will access the archive in the future.
“V oodoo has speciﬁ  c ceremonies that take 
place on a monthly basis for different spirits, and we want to collect all of those ceremonies in their full duration for the entire year,” Hebblethwaite 
said.
The project does not put the entire focus on 
voodoo, but includes religion as a whole in Hai-
ti. 
Hebblethwaite said he will now have the op-
portunity to examine other religions.
“We know even less about Mormonism in 
Haiti,” Hebblethwaite said, mentioning the lack of data about Freemasonry, Islam and Christian-
ity on the island. 
“Nobody is collecting audiovisual informa-
tion from all of these different religions,” he 
said.
The grant expires in three years, at which 
time the project may not be ﬁ  nished. There is no deﬁ  nitive end.
“It expands the project into possibly a lifetime 
of curation,” Hebblethwaite said.Grant will allow prof to go to Haiti◗ EACH EVENT FEATURES A

On a warm Tuesday night un-
der hot lights, Tom Hart took the 
microphone at Satchel’s Pizza. As the murmur of the audience quickly died down and heads looked his 
way , the 42-year-old Gainesville 
resident began to share a story of a French friend’s visit to America.
The storytelling is part of a com-
munity-involvement endeavor at Satchel’s. On the second Tuesday of each month, the eclectic pizza res-taurant hosts “The Conch,” an open mic night during which people tell 
true stories of hope, heartbreak and 
randomness.
The event started July 10. Two 
months later, the event is still going strong, said event coordinator Bill Bryson, 46.
The event is Bryson’s brainchild. 
As an amateaur storyteller, whose Southern upbringing created a 
lifelong love for storytelling, he ac-
quired a collection of recorded sto-ries as a child. As an adult, he began to listen to storytelling podcasts such as “The Moth” and “This American Life.”
He said he wanted to spread 
his love of storytelling with the Gainesville community, so he start-
ed “The Conch.”
The first night, about a dozen sto-
rytellers spoke, and the same num-
ber spoke in August. Each night fea-tures a general theme. Past themes have included “Every Dog Has Its Day,” and “There’s a First For Ev-erything.” Each night is recorded as a podcast and is available on Grow 
Radio, a local Internet radio station 
where Bryson works.
“There’s so much left to the imag-ination when someone is telling a story face to face,” he said. “There’s a real craft to storytelling.”
Freshman Ricky Marrero said he 
became interested in storytelling as a child.
“I love hearing personal stories, 
because they all have wisdom,” Marrero, 18, said.
As Larry Condra, a 58-year-old 
Gainesville resident, shared a hu-morous story about a car accident, the audience snickered at his story.
As the sun set, and more people 
came to the microphone, Bryson said he saw his vision start to take shape.
“What fascinates me is the things 
that are revealed about the storytell-er and about the circumstances,” he said. “It creates a sense of commu-nity and breaks down walls.”4, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 12, 2012

A “what’s up?” text. A smil-
ing photo. A text with a heart.
This might be the type of 
message you expect to receive 
from a friend or a significant 
other.
But as UF students get into 
the swing of a busy school year, 
hovering parents are using their newfound smartphone skills to keep in constant communica-tion — whether their kids like the idea or not.
“My mom texts me all the 
time,” said Jillian Guthrie, 18-year-old microbiology and cell science  freshman. “I love my mom, and I’m appreciative of all she’s done, but I don’t want to be constantly texting her.”
And it’s not just the texts. 
When freshmen log into Face-book, usually, those 18 notifica-
tions aren’t from their BFFs.
“My mom will go on Face-
book and message me and say , 
‘Jordyn, how do I do this? How do I do that? I don’t know what I’m doing!’” said 18-year-old psychology freshman Jordyn Middlebrooks.
Then the texting starts.
It starts off small, with,  
“How was your day?” Then 
it grows to reminders to call home. Before some students know it, parents are blowing up their children’s phones with little reminders — “Don’t forget to tip your cab driver!!” — and photos of family pets.
“When she does text, it’s al-
ways 10 questions at a time,” she said.
The texting makes her mom 
feel more comfortable, Middle-brooks said, but sometimes she 
looks at the messages and can’t 
help but groan.
Mitchell McGahan, an 
18-year-old finance freshman, said his mother continues to text him four or five times a day . It is her way to say she misses him.
As smartphones become 
more common and unlimited, the growing parental phenom-enon has spread to upperclass-men, too.
Junior Emily Thraen, 20, re-
membered her mother’s separa-tion anxiety from her freshman year vividly . Two years later, her mom still hovers.
She “posts and comments 
on every single thing I put on Facebook.”
But some students like the 
connection, saying technology aids in communication to simu-late the face-to-face talk they had at home.
Daniel Ditaranto, 19-year-
old criminology and law fresh-man, said he’s appreciative that technology makes it easy to contact his parents.
“The added communication 
makes things better,” he said. “I live four hours away , and it makes the gap smaller.”Students not pleased

For the next month, the best and the 
brightest university students will try to 
out-hack each other in the Hacker Games.
The competition, which was designed to 
test students’ abilities to solve algorithms, image processing, data structures and ar -
tificial intelligence, among others, began Saturday and continues until Oct. 6.
As of Tuesday night, UF had 54 mem-
bers in the game and about three times as many points as its closest competitor, 
Purdue University. In fact, UF was win-
ning the game Tuesday, ahead of Massa-chusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard University, Duke University, Cornell Uni-versity and Princeton University.
Fourteen schools are competing, most of which are top-tier universities, said Alex Guthrie, a 21-year-old UF computer science senior who’s playing the game.
Joe Thuemler, a UF mathematics senior 
and campus ambassador for the game, said there are seven levels in the game.
“The levels get progressively harder 
very quickly,” said the 21-year-old, who has been programming since he was 15. “You can solve level one in a couple min-utes if you are good. No one has made it past level four yet.”
Hackers can play from home and form 
groups to help solve each challenge.
“Right now, we are mostly working in-
dividually, but as the problems get harder, we will probably have to team up,” he said.

Muir: Innovation Hub will make UF students more marketable
Each company must be a “tech-
nology-based startup that plans to develop and market science- and 
technology-based products,” ac-
cording to the center’s website.
Chosen companies are required 
to have semi-annual reviews.
Melanie Battles, a 21-year-old 
UF statistics graduate student, is among several UF students who are interning at Innovation Hub. 
She started an internship with 
Gamedayr in May.
“There’s just a lot of startup 
companies here,” she said, “which is cool.”
McGraw, a UF engineering 
alumnus, said Innovation Hub staff has crucially assisted budding businesses.
“They are here for companies like us,” he said. “They couldn’t be more helpful.”
The Innovation Hub will be-
gin an undergraduate program in Spring called Innovation Academy. 
The program is an opportunity for students to attend UF on a Spring-
through-Summer calendar, and 
gain work experience at Innova-
tion Hub during the Fall semester.
It is another aspect of Innova-
tion Hub that will make UF stu-dents more marketable, Muir said.
She also said it will help rein-
force the Innovation Hub’s theory that entrepreneurs don’t need to be business majors. She said good 
entrepreneurs can vary from art majors to economics majors.
More important, Muir assured 
students that the Innovative Acad -
emy wouldn’t completely lose Fall 
semester benefits — especially Gators football tickets.
“They won’t be in class,” she 
said. “But they will be allowed to buy football tickets.”

Student Senators unanimously 
passed a bill re-allocating college and 
school Senate seats for Spring 2013 elections. The Senate also passed a bill to keep the district seats for the 
Fall 2013 elections the same.
Students in the College of Jour -
nalism and Communications will 
be represented by two senators in-stead of one. The College of Liberal Arts and Sciences and the College of Pharmacy will each lose one senator, making their total numbers six and one, respectively. The undergradu-
ate freshman class will add another 
senator for a total of four.
After the meeting, the chairman 
of the Judiciary Committee, Cay-man Weimer, said the numbers he 
used for both bills were based on 
data from Fall 2011.
Weimer said evaluating the seats 
happens annually, and the numbers are always old.
“There’s no efficient way except 
for doing it all at once,” he said.
A representative from the Gator 
Chapter of the National Associa-
tion for the Advancement of Col-
ored People spoke to the Senate in support of a referendum asking students if they want to rename the Reitz Union after Virgil Hawkins. Hawkins was an African-American who was denied entrance into UF in 1949 due to his race.
Student Nailah Summers said 
that “as a black, Latina and queer woman,” she could not turn a blind eye to J. Wayne Reitz’s history of racism and homophobia described 
in the referendum.“[It was] not OK 50 years ago, 
and it’s not OK today,” she said.

UF is a Public Ivy institution, according to 
reports released last month on a college guide 
website.
Educated Quest looked at UF’s retention 
rates, graduation rates and tuition in com-
parison to those of private Ivy League schools, 
said Stuart Nachbar, the website’s publisher and president. 
UF joined the University of North Carolina 
at Chapel Hill, Virginia Tech and the Univer -
sity of Georgia on the 12-school list.
Educated Quest also evaluated other fac-
tors, including curriculum, career services and the professional network public colleges 
provide against those at private Ivies like Yale University and Harvard University.
“There’s no question that the level of con-
nections a student would make if they attend-
ed the University of Florida would be excel-lent,” Nachbar said.
“A diligent student will get a fine education 
at any one of them,” according to Nachbar’s post on the website. “But a school should not be considered a Public Ivy unless it makes the educational experience more economical for all of its students, not just the ones who qualify for its more prestigious academic programs or 
scholarships.”
UF spokesman Steve Orlando said he 
thinks calling UF a Public Ivy is accurate, con-
sidering the esteemed reputation Ivies typi-cally enjoy.
“You get such a high quality of education 
at a fraction of the price of true Ivy League schools,” Orlando said.
The website required that colleges have 
a minimum 90 percent freshmen retention — UF’s is 96 percent, Orlando said — and a minimum 75 percent six-year graduation rate — UF’s is 83 percent.
In-state tuition and fees must not exceed 
one-third the rate of the least expensive Ivy , and out-of-state tuition rates must not exceed two-thirds of the most expensive Ivy.
UF students had mixed reactions to the 
new, unofficial classification.
Biological engineering senior Nancy Nguy-
en, 20, said she doesn’t think UF measures up to her perception of Ivies.
“I don’t see it catering towards students as 
much as I hope a Ivy League [would],” Nguy-en said.
However, 20-year-old Michele Fusco, a 
Spanish and political science senior, said the

BACK ON SLEEP WHEN STRESSED.

Students continue to sacri-
fice sleep in the name of good 
grades, and UF counselors are trying to combat students’ misconceptions about a good 
night’s rest.
Sherry Benton, director of 
UF’s Counseling and Wellness 
Center, said about 35 percent of students who go to the center re-port difficulty sleeping among their symptoms of stress.
Students should get about 
seven to 10 hours of sleep a 
night to be at their best physi-
cally , emotionally , socially and academically , according to the GatorWell website.
Emma Caldwell, a 19-year-
old architecture sophomore, said she usually goes to bed at 2 a.m. and wakes up between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m. On average, she 
said she gets about six hours of 
sleep a night.
“I’m usually up working 
in the studio for architecture,” Caldwell said, “building mod-els and drawing.”
Jane Emmerée, health pro-
motion specialist at GatorWell, said sleep consistency and rou-tine are important for students 
to perform their best daily .  The 
idea is for students to go to bed and wake up around the same time as often as possible.
“Sleep affects memory ,” she 
said. “Good sleep quality and enough sleep help with what’s called memory consolidation.”
GatorWell provides access 
to “Sleeping in the Swamp: A Sleep Improvement Program,” enabling students to watch a 13-minute video with sleeping tips, take a sleep self-assessment test and create an action plan to improve sleeping habits.
Sleep campaigns have be-
come popular on college cam-
puses within the past decade 
because more research has come out showing sleep’s im-portance to memory and aca-demic performance, Emmerée said.  
Students tend to cut back 
most on their sleep when they’re stressed or during high-
impact exams, she said. How-
ever, this can cause students to perform poorly when test day comes around.
“They really deprive them-
selves of sleep around busy times,” Emmerée said. “But when we cut back on our sleep, then we don’t remember things 
as well, and it kind of snow-
balls.”UF urges students to 
get some extra zzz’s

A Gainesville man allegedly 
broke into his girlfriend’s house and 
threatened to kill her while she was on the phone with police Monday night.
GPD officers later arrested Ken-
neth Roy Coleman, 30, after he was found hiding under a bed.
Police charged Coleman, of 2811 
SW Archer Road, with burglary, sim-ple assault with intent to do violence and obstructing justice, according to a GPD arrest report.
Coleman and his girlfriend, Ker -
reima Walker-Mitchell, 27, went to a store Monday night to buy some diapers for her baby, said a neighbor who spoke to Walker-Mitchell the 
morning after the incident.
Coleman started drinking when 
the pair returned, the neighbor said. 
He then left the house after an argu-ment with Walker-Mitchell.
At about 9:30 p.m. Coleman re-
turned, reached through a broken window and unlocked the back 
door, according to the report.Walker-Mitchell told him not to 
come into the house and called 911.
Coleman got 
in, took the phone 
and threatened to kill her. Police dis-patch overheard the threat and reported the inci-
dent to officers.
Walker-Mitch-
ell ran outside 
and called 911 again.While searching, an officer saw 
through a window Coleman hiding underneath a mattress.
After Coleman ignored several 
commands from police, officers sent in a police dog, Roo, to subdue Cole-man, and officers arrested the man.
Police booked Coleman into Ala-
chua County Jail at 1:15 a.m. Tues-day with a $10,000 bond. He met bond and was released at 3:37 p.m.

tattoo? Students shouldn’t give up job search
Throughout the past several days, a disturbing sta-
tistic has emerged. 
This factor can potentially threaten the future livelihood of up to 50,000 people located in our stomping grounds —UF.  
According to the Department of Labor monthly 
jobs report, almost 500,000  people ages 16 to 24 have stopped looking for jobs. 
This age group most notably concerns college stu-
dents looking for internships as well as immediate posi-tions following graduation.  
Overall, it appears that on a national scale, fewer job 
opportunities exist for college students.  
While there is no need to bring gloom to the forefront 
of the minds of UF students, this number should ﬁ  rst and foremost serve as a wake-up call.  
The stature of the situation may be reduced due to 
the fact that a majority of students have returned to 
school within the past month. 
Nevertheless, this report should serve as a warning 
that we all must act now — while in college — to make 
ourselves more marketable for future employment.
At this point, with Election Day drawing nearer, we 
could argue and discuss which candidates’ economic policy will best serve college students following gradu-ation.  
Instead, it’s more important than ever to consider 
how to maximize the UF experience so that none of us are included in this statistic in the near future.
According to Heidi Shierholz, an economist at the 
Economic Policy Institute, there are “less opportunities for them [students]. They have it rough.”
While this may or may not be true, we ought to take 
any opportunity on campus to grow as  leaders, as  stu-dents and as  future employees.
We often say there is no time like the present.
As college students, this is very easy for us to do. However, there is no doubt that 
while enjoying our college ex-periences, we need to at least plan for the future.  We should set obtainable yet meaningful 
long-term goals.  
While pursuing our hobbies 
and passions, we need to look 
down the road into the future 
and ask ourselves where we want to be at the conclu-sion of the UF experience.  
It is of the utmost importance to have the ambition 
and drive to take action to make that goal come to frui-tion by pursuing professional development as well as 
leadership opportunities. 
There is literally no time to waste if we truly want 
that competitive edge in the job market.
Because various political campaigns will spin the 
most recent unemployment report to meet a speciﬁ  c 
agenda and will attempt to blame our troubles on the opposition, regardless of economic conditions, it is es-sential to market ourselves positively and to seek that edge among our peers.  
Our most precious resource is time, and as college 
students, it should be our job to maximize it. 
The ball is in our court, and the choice is up to us to 
determine what we want out of college, and thus, where 
we want to be following graduation.  
At the end of the day, no jobs report — positive or 
negative — should alter our UF experience.
Regardless, we must seize the day and create our 
own destiny by putting our future in our own hands so that we may maximize our time now to best serve us 
into the future.

Chicago educators 
ﬁ  ght against policy
It is eight weeks before Election Day . Do you know where 
your teachers are?
On Monday , more than 20,000 teachers walked off the job 
in Chicago-area schools. This left hundreds of thousands of stu-dents with nothing to do, and parents with extra headaches.
The teachers are striking mostly due to “a precipitous decline 
in public school funding and rising public demand to use stan-dardized test scores in teacher evaluations,” according to the Los Angeles Times.
A law passed in Illinois in 2010 stated that standardized test 
scores should be factored into teacher reviews and evaluations. Those scores will account for up to 30 percent of teachers’ evalu-ations by 2014. The educators feel that is too much weight.
“There are a lot of factors that go into a child’s education that 
is not reﬂ  ected in test scores,” said Chicago teacher Rick Sawicki. “Children are more to me than their test scores.”
This protest is in President Obama’s hometown; his back-
yard, his stomping grounds.
It doesn’t shed a positive light on the relationship between 
teachers’ unions and the Democratic Party.
“Our principal concern is for the students, and his princi-
pal concern is for the students and families who are affected by the situation,” White House spokesman Jay Carney said. “And 
we hope that both sides are able to come together to settle this 
quickly and in the best interest of Chicago’s students.”
Some parents blame teachers for the consequences of their 
strike. Rachelle Cirrintano, a professor at the University of Illi-nois at Chicago, worried about her son.
“There was no reason to do this when they just got situated,” 
she said. “All the teachers should be let go for their irresponsibil-ity to the children and their families.”
Should we criticize the teachers for speaking out about the 
wrongs they feel they have been dealt? Or do we empathize with them for wanting to be treated fairly and to reach justice?
It’s tough to understand teachers who go on strike after the 
school year has already started, but if you ask them, this could have been resolved a while ago.
“This could have been solved on day negative ﬁ  ve,” said 
Christopher Barker, a math teacher at George Manierre Elemen-tary School.
Quippy math jokes aside, maybe the problem should have 
never reached this point. This strike is caused by more than just petty differences, and it is affecting more than those in schools.
“I don’t see a (reason) for a ﬁ  ght,” said Rose Davis, a grand-
mother of two. “They could have come to decision before kids even started school, because my grandkids love going to school, they don’t want to be out.”
Despite Davis’ painful diabetic condition, she “walked with 
them Monday the six blocks to Benjamin E. Mays Elementary Academy in Englewood — about ﬁ  ve blocks farther than the 
school they normally attend — where they ate breakfast and 
lunch, read books, worked on computers and played games. She 
went back four hours later to escort them home,” according to 
The Associated Press.

Letters to the Editor
Dear Chip,
After reading your article on Tuesday, 
titled “Professors take the easy way out, too,” I felt compelled to write this letter. Where do I even begin?
Clearly, you have opinions about text-
books and their relationship with your college education. There must be some deep-seated reason you wrote this article beginning with a rant about textbook prices and royalty fees, but that’s an entirely different story for a dif-ferent day.
I ﬁ  nd your words here appalling. You ef-
fectively single out a distinguished professor 
of the university’s Department of Geological 
Sciences, who has a Ph.D. in geology and is not some “aloof archaeologist.” You claim he wrote his own textbook and supplemental content just to make a proﬁ  t from poor col-lege students, and that he is fully aware that students are sharing test questions to get an easy A. Did you ever consider talking to the professor about why he chose to write his own content for his class? Or did that over-
privileged, smart-aleck brain of yours just 
tell you to write a defamatory article behind a professor’s back and think it was a brilliant idea? The fact is, you’ve done nothing but prove yourself a fool here.
You called out a student for having the 
“gall” to complain about not getting away with cheating when students previously had no problem cheating at all. Yet you openly 
admit you had the “gall” to write obscene 
language on your chemistry lab report. What possessed you to do such a thing? As a senior in college, I’d like to think you’re not that immature, but you’re not helping your case here.
The fact is nearly every college textbook 
you’re required to use is written by either cur-rent or retired college professors somewhere in the world, a fact that you apparently have 
no grasp of. Your article also references “pro-
fessors” taking the easy way out. You men-tion this plurality of human beings, yet you proceed to single out one professor in a school of tens of thousands of students.
You can have your opinion of textbooks 
and their relationship to your college career. You can have your opinion of college pro-fessors, cheating and people taking the easy 
way out. That much you are entitled to. There 
are legitimate ways to express your opinions about topics such as these, and even work to create solutions to these issues you seem to have about textbooks. However, your actions and attitude here in this article prove that you are doing everything but that. The bottom line is, you are an unprofessional, unedu-cated, over-privileged student who appar-ently thinks that writing defamatory articles 
against university faculty , with no substance 
or backing of facts, is news. Well, news ﬂ  ash, Chip, you won’t get anywhere in this world with the attitude you have here. I think an of-ﬁ  cial written apology to the professor referred to in your article is in order. And publish it in the Alligator. Let’s see if you can learn how to act like a professional journalist, or if you’re just another stuck-up college brat like your 
article seems to convey.

As a product of the ‘90s teen pop revolution, it is 
incredibly difﬁ  cult to avoid referencing Britney Spears in my writing.
It’s not my fault for wanting to.She’s the divine matriarch of pop music, and every-
one has been doing it since I was 11.  
Before her triumphant return to pop prominence, 
Brit-tizzle opted to remake Bobby Brown’s “My Prerog-ative,” setting the stage for a number of decisions that left her salivating legions confounded and concerned.
The intro ﬁ  nds her opining about truth, implying that 
her personal truth can exist apart from the truth of those around her. The philosophical undertones of the song echo an increasingly popular view in our modern soci-
ety, and I’m intrigued.
This begs a few questions: Is truth relative? Can mo-
rality be subjective? Do right and wrong exist?
The major religions would afﬁ  rm that morality is 
objective, with their foundations being set on the idea 
that good and evil concretely exist in our world. Other 
streams of thought differ. Moral relativism, or postmod-
ernism, is the idea that there is no absolute moral and ethical standard for humans to conform to. In essence, it is impossible — even judgmental — to distinguish wrong from right, because every individual is different, having had a subjective life experience.
This leaves me with some nagging questions. I un-
derstand the unsettling implications of ascribing to an absolute standard in this age of tolerance.
Our society is always complaining about what’s 
“wrong” with the world.
Gossip is “wrong” — if we’re the ones being gos-siped about. 
Cheating on your spouse 
is “wrong.”
Embezzling money from 
a company designed to help retirees is “wrong.” 
Having children without 
health care is “wrong.”
We are great at calling a 
spade what it is, aren’t we?
It seems that we are constantly appealing to each oth-
er from some unspoken standard of fairness and justice, as though it were written in the fabric of our conscious-ness. We lack consistency in our convictions.
I understand if the idea of the Bible, the Quran or 
the Vedas nauseates you, but if we’re honest with our-selves, we’ve only replaced these ancient standards with a “common sense” that is only common to ourselves. 
Bluntly speaking, most relativists aren’t relativists.  I’m probably overreaching, but I’ve only had the 
pleasure of meeting one person in my lifetime who truly 
believed that nothing was right or wrong, including 
rape or murder.
Bottom line: Some things are relative, and some 
things — like mathematics — are absolute.
Is morality of the former or the latter? Can truth be 
bent to the will of the person wielding it? Even more per-plexing, what if your truth says my truth is a lie?
Still, a larger question remains: In whose standard 
should we trust?
Oops, I did it again.Ryan Galloway is a religion senior. His column appears

With the Republican and Democratic National Conven-
tions completed and the party bases energized, the real campaigning begins as the candidates focus their efforts 
more aggressively on swing states.
The Democratic Party has demonstrated that it knows how to 
rally its base and energize support.
In light of post-convention polling, the same cannot be said for 
the Republican Party.
Gallup reported that Obama leads Romney by about 4 percent 
in polls conducted in the ﬁ  rst week of September. Although this signals a bump for Obama since the DNC, it is far from a large enough cushion to promise re-election.
To ensure that Obama has a one-term presidency , Romney must 
put an end to his stale campaign strategy. He needs to brand him-
self as the best candidate for the job, rather than merely as an ac-
ceptable alternative to Obama. Romney must invigorate his cam-paign by discussing policy before the national debates in October, and explain how his platform will revive the economy, help the middle class and ameliorate the budget deﬁ  cit.
Despite Obama’s recent gains, 
Romney has plenty of time to exploit the less-than-stellar job report that’s release this week was unfortunately 
timed to be the same day as Obama’s 
acceptance speech.
Although the unemployment rate fell by .2 percent, the decrease 
is due in part to the fact that fewer Americans are actively search-
ing for work. Only 96,000 jobs were created in August, compared with the 153,000 average jobs per month last year.
Despite Obama’s convention speech’s energy , the jobs report 
does little to support his efforts to defend his economic plan.
In response to the new unemployment numbers, the Romney 
campaign would be wise to target advertising in swing states where unemployment is the highest.
This brings to mind a few key toss-up states: Nevada, Florida 
and North Carolina. Nevada suffers from a 12 percent unemploy-ment rate, while Florida and North Carolina’s rates are at 8.8 per-cent and 9.6 percent, respectively. These battleground states will provide the best return on investment if Romney chooses to adver-tise aggressively.
We know where the president stands, and we know the policies 
he wants to put in place.
Romney has been all rhetoric and no discussion. While his RNC 
speech was inspiring for Republicans, it failed to connect policy objectives with the RNC’s 30 million viewers — many of whom were moderates and independents.
If George W. Bush was able to galvanize support from his base 
and inspire conﬁ  dence in moderate voters in 2004, Romney cer-tainly can obtain an edge on Obama in these next two months.
After both conventions, Americans understand that Obama 
and Romney are great husbands, fathers and friends, but what’s important now is to end the ideological warfare and commence the rebuilding of this nation.

Jerry Seinfeld will bring his com-
edy act to UF this fall.
Tickets to see Seinfeld live Nov . 
2 at the Phillips Center for the Per -
forming Arts go on sale Friday at 
noon. 
Todd Taylor, public relations rep-
resentative for UF Performing Arts, 
said there is no student pricing for 
the event. Students, along with the 
general public, may purchase seats 
in the balcony and upper boxes for $64, or in the mezzanine, orchestra and pit for $79.
Phillips Center Box Office man-ager Robbie Stevens said the show 
will probably sell out quickly, like it 
did when Seinfeld performed at UF in 2008.
Even though many college stu-
dents were tod-
dlers at the height of Seinfeld’s TV comedy success, Stevens said he’ll 
garner name rec-
ognition around 
Gainesville.
“Any time you 
can get a name like Jerry Seinfeld in 
your community and city , I think 
that’s a good thing,” Taylor said.He said fans from other areas of 
the state are likely to come if other 
Florida tour stops sell out.
Taylor said the university was 
not affiliated with inviting the show 
to campus.
“I’m just really excited because 
I didn’t think I’d ever get a chance 
to see him doing stand-up,” said 
Severin Walstad, a 21-year-old pub-
lic relations senior. “The only thing 
that’s going to keep students from going is probably the ticket price.”

The deadline for the Gainesville 
Photography Contest is Sunday.
Participants can submit up to 
10 photographs, according to the 
contest rules posted on the City of 
Gainesville website. Entries should 
be composed according to the con-test theme, which is “My Gainesville is...” The rules state the photos should represent Gainesville’s cul-ture beyond UF.
“This contest brings the com-
munity together,” contest organizer Laura Rawson said, “and makes 
people want to get involved with the government while having fun 
because, as you can imagine, gov-ernment-sponsored activities are not always the most fun thing to do.”
The photographs must be sub-
mitted electronically via the City of Gainesville website, the city’s Flickr group or email. Submissions should include the photograph, the location, 
the photographer’s name and contact 
information.
Photos must be submitted by 
midnight on the due date. However, if 500 photographs are already sub-mitted, the contest may close sooner.
The grand prize does not include 
money due to budget limitations, Rawson said. The winner’s photo-

The man New York Maga-
zine once called “the most fa-
mous narc in America” thinks marijuana should not be legal-ized — but the editor of High 
Times magazine disagrees.
The two will hash out the 
national issue at UF during the 
Accent Speakers’ Bureau event “The Great Weed Debate: Heads vs. Feds.” It will take place at 8 p.m. Sept. 24 in the University Auditorium.
The event will feature vet-
eran Drug Enforcement Admin-istration agent Bob Stutman and High Times editor Steve Hager.
The men have a history of 
debate against each other, said Accent chairman Josh Holtz-man. The two debated at UF in 2002.
“We thought it would be a 
good idea to rekindle the de-bate, especially since students weren’t here to see it ten years ago,” Holtzman said.
The debate is Accent’s first 
event this semester. It will cost the organization $10,000, Holtz-man said, and correlates with future programs surrounding implications after elections.
He said Stutman and Hager 
will bring “a wealth of knowl-edge, experience, facts and things that might not always come up when this issue is dis-cussed.”
These factors could sway 
some students’ opinions. 
Mechanical engineering 
sophomore Alexandro Gonza-
lez, 19, said he used to disagree 
with smokers, but is now more accepting.
“Everyone has their own 
choice,” Gonzalez said. “Some students say it’s a stress reliever. Some do it to escape problems.”
The NORML Gators, an or -
ganization that works to reform marijuana laws, supports safe marijuana use. 
The president of the orga-
nization, Guy Andrew Ginton, said he plans to attend the de-bate.
“No person in their right 
mind will defend the drug war as being successful,” Ginton said. “It is impossible, since it would require defending hun-
dreds of thousands of innocent 
deaths.”
Biology junior Michelle Cat-
ania, 20, said she thinks it’s a good idea that Accent is provid-ing representation for both sides of the issue.
“Hopefully it’ll be more civil 
than current presidential com-
mercials, which bash each oth-

� THE ASSAILANT HAD 
BEEN HARASSING THE VICTIM ABOUT HER   BOYFRIEND FOR MORE THAN A YEAR. 
CHRIS ALCANTARA
Alligator Writer
An argument about an 
ex-boyfriend led to the ar -
rest of a Gainesville woman 
accused of chasing a woman 
twice — once with a hammer and again with two wooden sticks. 
Gainesville Police charged 
Celestia Vanessa Howard, 44, Sunday night with aggra-vated assault with a deadly weapon, according to a GPD 
arrest report.
The report gave the fol-
lowing account:
At about 5 p.m. Sunday, 
Twana Robinson, 39, con-
fronted Howard about her boyfriend.
The argument escalated 
when Howard went into 
her apartment, grabbed a 
hammer from the kitchen drawer and chased Robinson through the Gardenia Gar -
dens apartment complex at 1727 NE Eighth Ave.
During the chase, Robin-
son fought back, knocking the hammer from Howard’s hand before Howard’s boy-friend broke up the fight.
Howard then went back 
into her apartment, changed her clothes and armed her -
self with two 2-foot wooden sticks. 
She then chased Robinson 
out of the complex.
When police got to the 
scene, an officer stopped 
Howard and arrested her 
about three blocks away from the complex.
After her arrest, Howard 
said Robinson harassed her 
for more than a year. 
Howard added that she 
“snapped” after Robinson 
came to her apartment and 
started an argument about 
Howard’s boyfriend, accord-ing to the report.
Robinson said Howard 
struck her twice with the 
hammer, but officers didn’t 
find any injuries to match her story, according to the report.
Police arrested Howard at 
6:26 p.m. Sunday and booked her into Alachua County Jail at 7:11 a.m. Monday with a $15,000 bond. 
Howard met bail and was 
released Tuesday.

  Will Muschamp always wears 
his realistic glasses.
  After using that phrase follow-
ing Florida’s win against Texas 
A&M to explain the development of UF’s run-based attack, Mus-champ said the same treatment 
should’ve been applied to tight 
end Jordan Reed last season.
  Although the former quarter-
back caught 28 passes in his ﬁ  rst season at tight end, he missed two 
games with a hamstring injury. 
Now he is Florida’s leading re-ceiver.
  “I know we all think that be-
cause Rivals put 48 stars by their name, ‘OK, so they’re supposed to just be an outstanding football player the moment they walk on campus,’” Muschamp said. 
“It takes a process to become 
a good player, and just because you’re a great athlete doesn’t mean you’re going to be a really 
good football player. Sometimes it 
takes time.”
  After the ﬁ  rst two games of 
2012, Reed appears to have ﬁ  g-
ured out his position. He leads 
all receivers with eight receptions and 92 yards.   Quarterback Jeff Driskel said 
he enjoys having a 6-foot-3 tight 
end with explosive speed and elu-
sive ability. 
Reed turned a crossing route in 
the second quarter into a 30-yard gain — Florida’s second-longest 
pass play against the Aggies.
  “He’s deﬁ  nitely a matchup 
problem if they have to bring 
down linebackers or safeties on 
him,” Driskel said. “I’ll take him 
one-on-one with anybody. He’s deﬁ  nitely a guy we want to get the ball in his hands.”
  After dealing with drops last 
season, Reed has caught every ball thrown his way. 
Since arriving in Gainesville 
in 2009 as a four-star dual-threat quarterback from New London, Conn., Reed has tried to become a better blocker by improving his 
strength and toughness.
  “This is his second year of play-
ing the tight end position,” Mus-champ said.  “The natural process Reed growing into tight end role, leads Florida in receiving

  With defender Kat Williamson out indeﬁ  -
nitely due to a torn right meniscus, the Gators 
will look to a pair of seniors to anchor the de-fense.
  The duo of defensive midﬁ  elders, Holly 
King and Jo Dragotta, will look to solidify the Gators’ back line when the team begins  its Southeastern Conference schedule this week-end.
  “They play a big role in our defense, for 
sure,” coach Becky Burleigh said. “As hold-ing midﬁ  elders, they’re one of the links be-tween our back line and the forwards.”
  Dragotta and King will play in front of a 
younger backline made up of former forward Taylor Travis, junior Maggie Rodgers (who just returned from a left ankle sprain) and underclassmen Tessa Andujar, Annie Bobbitt and Christen Westphal.
  “It’s so much fun to watch them grow,” 
Dragotta said. “Christen, from the very be-
ginning of the season until now, it’s just ri-
diculous how much she’s grown, to see her conﬁ  dence come out on the ﬁ  eld. And Annie 
Bobbitt, just her being thrown back into center back, and she’s already composed. … I’m com-fortable with them and 
I’m conﬁ  dent with them.”
  As midﬁ  elders, Dragotta and King have 
the ability to affect the game on both offense and defense. King scored her ﬁ  rst goal of the season against New Mexico on Sunday . However, in the Gators’ 4-3-2-1 formation, Dragotta and King often ﬁ  nd themselves on the defensive side of the ball. Dragotta has not scored a goal in her time at Florida.Midﬁ  elders King, Dragotta

UF SoccerEND OF GREGULATION
  Florida has only four sacks in the 
season’s ﬁ  rst two games and will be without 2011 sack leader Ron-
ald Powell for the rest of the year, but it’s not time to panic just yet. 
  Lerentee McCray and Dante Fowler 
Jr. are more than capable of replacing Powell’s contribution, which was over-rated. The Gators’ lack of early produc-tion is owed much more to the systems they’ve faced than anything they’re doing wrong.
  I hate to write ill of a player who 
coaches say has worked harder than 
anyone they’ve ever seen to return 
from a torn ACL suffered in Florida’s spring game on April 7, but it’s impor-tant to be realistic. 
The 6-foot-4, 244-pound Powell has 
yet to fully harness the athleticism that keeps talent evaluators drooling and made him the No. 1 overall player in the class of 2010.   Sure, he has 
the potential to become one of the game’s most dynamic pass-
rushers. And 
yeah, he led the team with six sacks in 2011. But take a closer 
look at those plays:
  -FAU, second quarter, third-and-18: 
Powell is picked up in protection by a back and neutralized until Dee Fin-
ley and Jaye Howard narrowly miss a 
sack, at which point the quarterback is forced into Powell’s waiting arms. 
  -Tennessee, third quarter, ﬁ  rst-
and-goal: Nobody so much as looks at Powell, who gets the easiest half-sack of his life on a busted screen play. 
  -Kentucky, ﬁ  rst quarter, third- Loss of Powell should not 
concern Gators defense

“We all wanted him to be like (Mark) Bavaro out there.” 
Will Muschamp 
UF football coach
(on Jordan Reed’s switch to tight end in 2011)and-3: The pocket disintegrates after nearly four seconds, 
and Powell gets credited with half of a sack for being on top of the pile. 
-Georgia, first quarter, first-and-10: Aaron Murray 
play-fakes, pump-fakes and scrambles to his right, where 
Powell is on containment duty. Powell makes a good 
play nearly five seconds after the ball was snapped to keep Murray from getting the edge. 
-Vanderbilt, third quarter, first-and-10: Powell rips 
under the left tackle and although he doesn’t beat him cleanly, Powell creates enough leverage to push the blocker backwards. Jordan Rodgers scrambles away, but Powell chases him down to force intentional grounding. 
-Florida State, second quarter, second-and-10: Pow-
ell tries to blow past the left tackle on the outside and is shoved past the play before doubling back and sacking E.J. Manuel, who never moved. 
-Ohio State, second quarter, third-and-12: Powell 
stunts inside but gets flattened by a back’s cut block. Powell gets up and eventually tracks down OSU quar -
terback Braxton Miller nearly six seconds after the ball was snapped. 
Powell certainly made a few good plays, but he has 
yet to show true dominance. At no point did he execute a pass-rush move, beat his blocker cleanly and record a sack in less than four seconds — usually enough time for the quarterback to get a pass off. 
His six total sacks tied for No. 72 in the nation. He had 
only three other tackles for loss. His 32 total tackles were 10th on Florida. 
Powell was certainly a valuable piece to UF’s defense, 
but he’s replaceable. 
Fowler, another five-star prospect, has proven that 
he’s ready to play as a freshman. McCray is the type of hybrid UF needs to fill Powell’s shoes. 
The limited production this season is more a result of 
Florida’s opponents, as Bowling Green and Texas A&M relied on timing passing attacks. Quarterbacks Matt Schilz and Johnny Manziel rarely held onto the ball, leav-ing pass-rushers virtually no time to make an impact.
Against Tennessee and quarterback Tyler Bray this 
weekend, Florida will finally have a chance to prove it has a competent pass rush, even without Powell. If the Gators get torched and Bray looks comfortable in the pocket, then it’s time to panic.

Reed headlines a tight end group 
that includes freshman Kent Taylor, who didn’t travel to College Sta-tion, Texas, due to an undisclosed 
injury. Coaches expect him to play 
against Tennessee on Saturday.
Tevin Westbrook, Omarius Hines 
and Clay and Trey Burton all have seen time at the position.
Trey Burton has caught four 
passes for 28 yard, while Hines has 
two catches for 46 yards.
“Our tight ends are always go-
ing to be involved,” offensive coor -
dinator Brent Pease said last week. “They create matchups, especially 
with Jordan on people. I think he can win consistently on.”
Reed causes problems for de-
fenses and is the most consistent 
contributor among tight ends, Mus-
champ said.
Pease, who wasn’t happy with the number of touches Reed re-ceived in Week 1, was pleased with the junior’s performance against 
the Aggies.
“He’s learning,” Pease said. 
“He’s doing a great job in the run game. … He’s coming along, you 
know. He provides a big opportu-nity for us to be able to put him in a 
lot of spots.”

“If it happens, it’s great. I’ll probably freak 
out,” she said. “But at the same time, I just 
want to win.”
Said King: “I think I pride myself more on 
that than scoring goals or giving assists. I think 
my position is more defensive midfield. … Jo is 
exactly the same way I am.” 
King and Dragotta have been starting to-
gether since last season and have become close friends off the field.
“I’ve lived with her for I think three years 
now, so we know each other like the back of our hands,” Dragotta said.
The duo believes their off-the-field chemis-
try has led to on-the-field success.
“Those two are so experienced and they 
have such great chemistry ,” Burleigh said. “It’s really fun to watch them play together.”
Dragotta and King will play a crucial role 
in leading the Gators when they take on Ken-tucky and Auburn this weekend to open SEC play. Kentucky beat then-No. 25 Louisville last weekend before losing for the first time this 
season on Sunday.
“It’s a whole new season for us,” Burleigh 
said.14, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 12, 2012

3. � Johnathan Franklin , UCLA run-
ning back (7): 431 rushing yards, 10.5 
yards per carry, 3 rushing touchdowns; 4 receptions, 63 yards, 1 receiving touchdown.
Franklin went mostly unnoticed after one dominant outing but will not be ignored following his perfor-mance in Week 2. Franklin has run for more than 200 yards 
in each of UCLA’s ﬁ  rst two games, most recently carrying 26 times for 217 yards in a 36-30 win against Nebraska. He also caught three passes for 59 yards and a score.

When Brent Pease took over as 
Florida’s offensive coordinator in 
January, he had no idea what to 
expect from Mike Gillislee.
Pease knew very little about the 
senior running back, but it didn’t take long for Gillislee to make an 
impression.
“I didn’t know Mike from what’s 
happened in the past, and I didn’t 
look at him that way,” Pease said. “I looked at him from what I saw 
in the spring. I knew in the spring, 
‘This kid’s got something.’”
Gillislee has proved Pease right 
so far, leading the Southeastern Conference with 231 yards and four touchdowns in the Gators’ first two games
Gillislee scared Florida fans 
when he disappeared for the ma-jority of the fourth quarter of Satur -
day’s win against Texas A&M with an undisclosed injury. Coach Will 
Muschamp said Monday that his 
starting running back suffered a strained groin but would be at full strength for Florida’s game against 
Tennessee this week.
Still, Muschamp said he would 
avoid overloading Gillislee in this 
week’s practices, and offensive co-ordinator Brent Pease said those 
limitations will help Matt Jones and Mack Brown, his primary backups.
“In any situation, whether he’s 
a little sore or not, he understands 
his reps now as far as practice 
goes,” Pease said of Gillislee. “So 
he doesn’t need as many. That’s where you try to get the other kids (involved) and build up their rep-etition base because he’s taking so 
many and he gets such live situa-
tions in the game he doesn’t need to continually take those.”
Driskel getting rid of the ball: The 
one glaring negative in an other -
wise solid performance for starting quarterback Jeff Driskel at Texas A&M was his failure to get the ball 
out of his hands in a timely fash-
ion.
Rather than throwing the ball 
away when he was unable to find an open receiver, Driskel ran out 
of bounds twice for a loss of yards, 
giving the Aggies two of their eight sacks.
“I’ve got to get rid of the ball 
earlier and not lock in onto my first read,” Driskel said. “Like I said, ‘Live another day if nothing is open and someone is coming at 
me and throw the ball away.’”
However, on Tuesday, center 
Jonotthan Harrison said the offen-
sive line should shoulder more of 
the blame for the sacks.
“I’m just going to do my job,” 
Harrison said. “As an offensive line 
unit, we’re going to do our job just to ensure that we pick up as many 
people as we can for protecting the 
backfield.”
Pease happy with wide receiv-
ers: Florida’s wide receivers were 
highly criticized in 2011, when the 
Gators finished 89th in the country in passing offense.
Florida’s leading pass catcher at 
wideout so far this season is Frankie Hammond Jr., who has just five re-ceptions, but Pease said he doesn’t mind not having a standout No. 1 at the position.
“I don’t really think you nec-
essarily have a No. 1 guy emerge because you want to have balance in those guys,” Pease said. “If you 
have balance, that means produc-
tion is each guy. I don’t want a defensive coordinator looking at it and saying ‘They’re throwing it to 
this guy all the time.’

For the Gators volleyball team, black 
and blue have become the unofficial 
team colors this season.
Sophomore outside hitter Noami 
Santos-Lamb became the first casualty 
when she went down on Aug. 18 with 
a torn ACL that will sideline her for the rest of the season. The Gators added a pair of names to the list of injuries last weekend, as Taylor Brauneis suffered a mild concussion and Jackie Swalchick fractured her arm.
Coach Mary Wise said she only held 
Brauneis out of Friday night’s win 
against Jacksonville as a precaution, but 
added she is still worried about wheth-er most of her players will be healthy in time for Florida’s first Southeastern Conference game against Arkansas on Friday.
When asked if this was where Wise 
wanted her team to be going into SEC play, she said: “Where we wanted them 
to be was healthy. But there are . . . 
things you don’t have control over. One is really our injuries.” 
Brauneis played in 255 of 257 sets 
without missing a single match in her three-year career before sitting out the Gators’ three-set sweep of the Dolphins on Friday night with a mild concussion. The junior transfer was one of the main 
reasons the Gators switched to a 5-1 sys-
tem, in which there is only one setter on the court at a time. Even after missing a full match, 
she still accounts for 76 percent of the team’s assists and is on pace to have the 
most assists in one season since Angie 
McGinnis had 1,485 in 2007. 
Replacement setter Dana Backlund 
tallied 33 assists against the Dolphins. 
“It was really nice to get a chance,” 
Backlund said. “My team did an awe-some job of greeting me right in with open arms. It was a really nice oppor -
tunity.”
Despite the win and the chance to see 
a fresh face enter the game, Wise still wants 
a healthy Brauneis come SEC play.
“It’s good for us to 
have Taylor healthy,” she said. “And because she’s been running this 
system, the 5-1, now in 
her third year of her 
college career, she’s so steady for us.”
And although the loss of outside hit-
ter Swalchick is not as detrimental to the team, her absence with a fracture in her arm will force other players to step up. 
Wise said the freshman’s injury only 
adds to the uncertainty that has grown  
since the beginning of the season. Still, 
sophomore Taylor Unroe said last weekend’s matches, with all the off-the-court issues, were just the challenge the Gators needed.
“This was a great test,” she said. “We 
did a good job of recovering and play-ing hard, and that’s how we won.”Gators dealing with rash of

Camilla Hedberg started her 2012 sea-
son perfectly on Tuesday . Not only did the 
Gators win the Cougar Classic, but the soph-omore also grabbed the first individual title of her college career.
After taking over the lead on Monday, 
Hedberg finished out the tournament with her third straight under-par round. She shot a 68 (-4) to put her at 203 (-13) for the tourna-ment, four strokes ahead of the field. 
“Camilla played another steady round 
today ,” coach Emily Bastel said. “She had to sleep on the lead last night and did a great job of handling her nerves today.”
In addition to Hedberg’s win, seniors Isa-
belle Lendl and Mia Piccio’s top-10 finishes helped Florida maintain its position at the top of the leaderboard.
Lendl shot her toughest round of the 
tournament on Tuesday . She turned in a 75 (+3), which consisted of only two birdies against five bogeys. 
Lendl started the day in second place,  
but dropped to fifth. Thanks to her first two rounds, Lendl finished the tournament 4 un-der.
“I am excited for the great start to our 
season, especially at a tournament with such a great field,” Bastel said. “This is a great confidence builder for us.”
Over in Kiawah Island, S.C, the men mir -
rored the women’s performance. 
Tyler McCumber, T.J. Vogel, A.J. Crouch and Santiago Gavino all finished in the top five to give the Gators the team title at The Invitational at The Ocean Course.
However, the Gators saw significantly 
higher numbers on the final day of the tour -
nament because they were playing through forceful wins. McCumber, Vogel and Crouch shot a combined 19 strokes higher on Tues-day than they did Monday.
“It was an unbelievable day of golf from 
a wind standpoint,” coach Buddy Alexan-der said of Tuesday. “The golf course was brutal, especially the last five holes.”
V ogel, who started the 
day in third place, carded a round of 77 (+5), which consisted of only three bird-ies against six bogeys and 
a double. Despite the high round, Vogel moved up to second place, falling only one stroke behind the leader.
Joining Vogel with a second-place finish 
was senior McCumber, who held onto that spot throughout the tournament. McCum-ber also turned in a high round of 79 (+7), but finished with a tournament total of 221 (+5) because of solid rounds on Sunday and 
Monday.
Florida’s 882 (+18) team total not only 
put it 24 strokes ahead of second place UT 
Arlington, but it also earned the team its sec-ond straight title at The Invitational.
“It was a great way to start the year,” Al-
exander said. “When the team wins though, everybody is happy.”

Texas A&M’s eight sacks against Florida 
on Saturday did not faze offensive coordi-
nator Brent Pease. He believes the Gators’ offensive line is the “strength of the team.”
“You look at the sacks; we go back and 
study them,” Pease said. “That’s what ev-erybody on the outside always looks at — the sacks.
“Go back and look. Out of eight sacks, 
two of them were ones that we needed to have better protection. You can’t put that on the O-line.”
Two weeks into the 2012 campaign, UF 
ranks last in the Southeastern Conference 
with nine sacks surrendered.
Coach Will Muschamp and Pease both 
acknowledged that Jeff Driskel held onto 
the ball too long on several plays against Texas A&M. However, center Jonotthan Harrison, who Muschamp named Florida’s offensive player of the game in the SEC opener, did not hold Driskel accountable for the sacks.
“We still are going to take the blame, just 
because we want to be a solid unit,” Harri-son said. “We don’t want to be considered the weakness of the team as a lot of people have been saying. We’re just going to keep working to ensure that Driskel’s protected and we keep him safe throughout the sea-son.”
Under the direction of new offensive 
line coach Tim Davis, the Gators have shown improvement in their run blocking. Excluding the 55 yards lost on nine sacks this season, UF has 81 carries for 417 yards —  an average of 5.1 yards per attempt.
“(I’m) very pleased with the run game,” 
Muschamp said.
After suffering a groin strain during 
Saturday’s win, Mike Gillislee may be lim-ited this weekend against Tennessee.  If the senior cannot handle a heavy load, the of-fensive line’s run blocking will face a sig-nificant test.
“Our job is crucial,” Harrison said. “It’s 
one of those positions — all work, no credit 
— and the more we work together, and the 
more we’re in these games, it’s just going to help us mesh as a unit even more.”
