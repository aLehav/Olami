Brittany Larsen brushed the ﬁ  nal strokes of 
black paint, deﬁ  ning the irregular burnt-orange 
spots of a giraffe on a thick poster board sign.
It was an ordinary Wednesday night, and 
the 20-year-old UF business junior was hover-ing over the completed craft in her room.
It was a 21-things-to-do poster for a custom-
er’s birthday following the tradition of students, and it helped Larsen’s crafting side-business thrive. The buyer didn’t have enough time to make a sign, so she responded to Larsen’s Face-book post advertising $8 creations, from which all proceeds go to animal rescues.
Larsen’s business stemmed from a sales 
management class in which the students were assigned to fundraise $1,700 for an organization using marketing techniques. In September, she formed the craft business and chose to give her proﬁ  ts to Paws on Parole, a program between the Alachua County Animal Services and the Florida Department of Corrections. 
The program helps prisoners learn how to 
care for the animals, and it helps the dogs so-cialize and become more adoptable.“I ﬁ  gured it’d be a great 
way to help out and give back while also doing some-thing I enjoyed,” she said.
Donations rallied by the 
sales management classes help fund the whole pro-gram, said Hilary Hynes, Alachua County Animal Services public education 
program coordinator. 
“If it didn’t exist, I would have to do some se-
rious marketing myself to get donation funds,” she said.
As the orders pile up, Larsen’s side business 
becomes tougher to schedule along with her 15-credit class schedule. 
She only handles two to three orders per 
week but is looking to expand depending on next semester’s workload and this semester’s success rate.
Right now, Larsen has raised about $50 from 
the craft projects but has more orders every day. 
“That’s really what we’re working for,” Lar-
sen said. “To give dogs a second chance at a good home.”FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 8, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 3

Some nights, work means galloping across 
a soccer field chasing a car burglar. Some 
nights, it’s clomping across a dance floor at a downtown club. Some nights, it’s simply try-ing not to get spooked by a bus.
These are normal shifts for Rusty and 
Zeus, two of the four-legged officers who don uniforms and badges before hitting the town at dusk.
Gainesville Police officers Tracy Funden-
burg and Tom Lardner spend three evenings per week patrolling crowds downtown and guiding their mounts through situations oth-er horses would balk at.
Each horse-and-rider team equals about 10 
officers on the ground, but as the force looks to get more officers on the ground without spending more, Fundenburg said it has eyed the mounted unit as a candidate for budget cuts more than once. This year was the closest the unit came to being slashed, she said.
Because much of their work is preventa-
tive — providing a presence — Fundenburg said it’s hard to show results to prove the mounted unit is still worth keeping intact.
“That’s the problem with our unit,” she 
said. “We’ll never know how many crimes we’ve prevented.”
Like the GPD aviation and K-9 units, it’s 
partially paid for through money from drug arrests. But the officers’ salaries, vehicles and gas come out of GPD’s general budget.
“Each time we get wind of being cut, 
we’re like ‘Oh my gosh, don’t they realize how we’re effective here,’” she said.
Fundenburg and Lardner will say the 
horses provide visibility, effective crowd con-trol and a positive way to relate to residents.
There’s also a bond between horse and 
rider. 
The relationship is evident when Funden-
burg grabs a packet of strawberry-frosted Pop-Tarts from a box that sits on a tack room shelf.
She crinkles the foil wrapper as she walks 
up behind her mount, a Belgian-Appaloosa mix named Rusty. His features become ani-mated. His ears lean forward and swivel. He arches his neck and swings his head around to lip the pastry — broken in half — from her hand.
The treat is the precursor to the routine of 
patrol nights.
  
Fundenburg clips a purple rope onto 
Rusty’s halter, but he shows no signs of budg-ing. She clicks and croons, trying to coax him out of the stall. The sagging rope between them insinuates it’s time to move, but she’s not rushing him. With horses, it’s all about trust. It’s coaxing, not forcing.
He complies, and she leads him behind the 
stable to a concrete wash pad. Lardner does the same for Zeus. “The boys” — that’s how Fundenburg refers to the horses — squabble and try to nip at each other when they pass through the narrow stable corridor.
Fundenburg and Lardner patrol down-
town Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights, primarily to monitor bar closings and pan-handling. On Fridays, the night usually starts by trailering the horses to Citizens Field on Waldo Road, where they’ll keep watch at the entrance to the high school football game for a couple of hours. It’s about visibility, to head off thefts in the parking lot, and it works. One night after a game, they caught a car burglar by chasing him across the field.
Spectators, mostly parents and children, 
make comments as they drift by. 
“Why are there horses here?”“I want a pony.”“Don’t yell at the horse, honey.”A 1-year-old girl holding her mother’s 
hand pointed at the pair of horses and bab-bled.
“That’s not a doggie,” her mom said, 
chuckling.
The mother, Danielle Jeannite, said the 
horses are approachable but also command-ing.
“It demands a certain authority,” she 
said.  
It’s that authority that Lardner said is so 
useful downtown at last call, when crowds spill out off of sidewalks and onto the road.
The horses sweep crowds back onto the 
sidewalks. They also provide another set of senses for observing and responding to po-tential threats. Lardner and Fundenburg watch the horses’ body language, particu-larly their swiveling ears, for clues.
Unlike cops on foot, Lardner and Funden-
burg can see over the crowd, which usually parts for them because people don’t want to get stepped on. To prevent fights, they listen for loud voices and watch for guys taking their shirts off. If they sense unrest in an area, they ride over, usually calming the tensions.
“It’s a rare occasion for the fight to not be 
over by the time we get there,” Lardner said.
But with higher visibility comes greater 
scrutiny and an increased potential for vio-lence.
In crowded, late-night situations, some-
times people slap the horses intentionally. It’s an arrestable offense.
Fundenburg and Lardner prep the horses 
for these scenarios at the stables to get them used to crowd interaction.
They train with dollar store items, pelting 
the horses with foam pool noodles, squirting them with silly string, startling them with umbrellas. In the controlled environment, they can give the horses a sense of winning each time.
“Anything that they’re going to encoun-
ter downtown and in the public, we try to introduce here in a safe environment where they’re going to win and be like, ‘Oh, that’s no big deal,’” Fundenburg said.
They also train while they’re downtown. 
One night, Lardner rode Zeus across the dance floor at :08 Country Western Club be-fore it opened. Because horses think anything black is a hole, the black floor must have looked like an abyss, Lardner said. Walking Zeus across was an exercise in trust.
Tonight, they may go stand by the end 
zone at the football game and wait for the band to march by.
After the game, Fundenburg and Lard-
ner will head to get dinner. They frequent a Subway on 13th Street because it has a big parking lot for the trailer. It’s hard to find a meal that’s not greasy fast food after 10 p.m., Lardner says.
Later, maybe they’ll trot to the Rosa Parks 
bus station to let the horses experience the woosh and gasping of the RTS buses passing. Zeus’ head got clipped once by a bus mirror, so he needs particular training to keep fears at bay.
But that’s all for later, for the early hours 
of the morning, the hours that smell like alco-hol and sweat. 
Right now, it’s cheering crowds, conces-
sion stands selling hotdogs and bands play-ing brassy songs. It’s chatting with parents who drift by.
How’re you doing, officer? How’s your 
horse?
“I’m loving life,” Fundenburg said. “Hap-
py to be on ‘em.”

A recent study suggests the firstborn 
child in a family is likely to be the most 
successful sibling, but some local students and faculty expressed hesitancy about the data.
The study, conducted by V. Joseph Hotz 
and Juan Pantano with the National Bu-reau of Economic Research, said a reason behind firstborns’ success could be that parents are stricter with them and become more lax with later-born children.However, Rosemary Barnett, a UF 
professor who teaches youth develop-ment and public policy, said she has some doubts about the study. 
Some of the research is based on the 
mother’s perceptions of the child’s aca-demic standing, such as class ranking, rather than actual achievement measures, she wrote in an email. 
The study may not look at other pos-
sible variables, “such as opportunities that parents may be able to give to the first child rather than the last child,” she said.
Still, the results weren’t surprising to 20-year-old UF criminology and sociology junior Michael Todd.
“Parents, in my experience, push the 
first child the most,” he said. 
Todd said the nature of parenting al-
lows for younger siblings to be compared to the firstborn.
Jenna Goldman, who is a firstborn and has younger twin sisters, said she doesn’t believe there is any less expected of her younger siblings. 
Rather, she said, there just might be dif-
ferent expectations for the oldest child.
“I was expected to be a role model,” 
said the 20-year-old UF history and public science junior.
As for her younger sisters, she said she 
doesn’t feel her family fits the representa-tion of the study.
“I think they’re very successful,” Gold-
man said. “I think my sisters are bril-liant.”
Firstborn children more successful than siblings, study says
“I was expected to be a role 
model.”

� IT WAS REMOVED NOV. 1. 
MICHAELA BISIENERE
Alligator Contributing Writer
A zombie-themed spoof on the 
“Chicken Soup for the Soul” books 
created by a UF alumnus has been pulled from Amazon.com due to trademark concerns.
“Chicken Soup for the Undead Soul” was published on the site Oct. 12 and removed Nov. 1.
The e-book includes a collection 
of stories that touch on zombie preg-nancy, mummy love and self-esteem issues of the undead.
Jordan Alva, creator of the book, 
said most of the stories were inten-tionally left unfinished so that read-ers can write their own endings. In light of the recent suspension, those stories may never have an ending.
“Amazon emailed me and said 
that they’ve suspended book sales, and have done so because a third party has notified them that there may be some trademark concerns,” Alva said.
Alva said he is looking into alter-
native ways to distribute the book but hopes to resolve the issue.
“I plan right now on continuing on the path that I’m on,” Alva said, “until I’m convinced that I am actu-ally doing something that’s wrong.”
Alva said he has always been in-
terested in donating proceeds of the book to a charity that encourages writing among students. The book may become available online for free with a requested donation for this cause. 
“It’s not about money; it’s about having fun and getting people to write,” Alva said.
Emily Olson, a contributing au-
thor to the book, said she supported Alva’s idea of making the book avail-able with a donation to a charity.
“If it gets people writing more 
and thinking more creatively, that’s something that I could easily get be-hind, no matter what motivates it,” she said.

There seems to be an epidemic of poor decisions 
plaguing mayoral ofﬁ  ces everywhere. 
Consider Anthony Weiner, a former U.S. rep-
resentative whose chance of occupying the mayoral of-
ﬁ  ce was diminished after a sexting scandal. 
The mayor of San Diego, Bob Filner, also resigned 
after a number of sexual harassment allegations were 
hurled at him last August. 
Even here in Gainesville, former Mayor Craig Lowe 
was arrested for driving under the inﬂ  uence earlier this year. 
However, the epidemic has now spilled over to Can-
ada.
It serves as no surprise, then, that on Oct. 29 Toronto 
mayor Rob Ford confessed to smoking crack. 
Because of his intimacy with the crack pipe — to 
which he was allured by a self-confessed “drunken stu-por” — the Canadian ofﬁ  cial has been asked to refrain from running for re-election next year. 
His response consisted of an apology to the people of 
the city — followed by a refusal to withdraw from the race next year. 
Such a refusal discredits any attempt at an apology 
made by Ford. 
It shows the mayor doesn’t take his responsibilities 
seriously.
He essentially faces no consequences for his actions. The dubious practice has become a routine for politi-
cians as of late. 
For instance, many of us thought Weiner’s career 
came to an end with his ﬁ  rst scandal.
Even though he had a second chance, Weiner chose 
to continue with his antics. 
Just like Ford, Weiner apologized and refused to re-
sign from politics. 
It’s no wonder that Bill De Blasio is now the mayor 
of New York City. So why do we hold our poli-
ticians to such a minimal moral standard?  
Why is it acceptable for a Ca-
nadian ofﬁ  cial to refuse to step down after admitting he has used crack in ofﬁ  ce? 
Why does the governor of 
South Carolina get elected to 
ofﬁ  ce after an episode of inﬁ  delity? 
There is no clear answer. The issue is not the drug use itself. After all, human beings will make mistakes, and 
many U.S. presidents have used drugs in the past, in-cluding President Barack Obama. 
Rafael Behr, writing for the Guardian, argues admit-
ting to drug abuse doesn’t signiﬁ  cantly damage a politi-cian’s career. 
Instead, what separates Ford from these politicians is 
that he was in ofﬁ  ce when he abused drugs. 
He then made the greatest mistake he could by ly-
ing about his drug use — a lie that eventually led to a scandal. 
There is a lesson that can be learned from Ford’s be-
havior. 
Those of us living in a democracy should hold our 
elected ofﬁ  cials to a higher standard. 
Otherwise, it’s pointless voting for people who aren’t 
taking their constituents seriously and prove incompe-tent in ofﬁ  ce. 
This means no more inﬁ  delity, drug use or sexting. And if we don’t?We will send a message to those ofﬁ  cials that they are 
free to do as they wish, and there are no consequences for their actions.

A sports scandal close to home has been making headlines 
all week: Miami Dolphins guard Richie Incognito has been suspended after a series of bullying allegations came out against him. 
Jonathan Martin, a Dolphins second-year offensive line-
man from Stanford, left the team last week. Incognito report-edly left racist and threatening texts and voicemails to Mar-tin. Incognito also worked actively to alienate Martin from the team. According to Business Insider, “a cafeteria prank where a bunch of teammates stood up and moved to another table when Martin tried to eat with them was the ﬁ  nal straw for the player.”
Incognito is basically a testosterone-fueled, beefy, racist 
Regina George. Although some have jumped to Incognito’s defense, we’re throwing a grow-up-and-learn-how-to-act-like-a-human-being DART at Richie Incognito. 
Starbucks gets a pretty bad rap sometimes as a haven for 
overpriced drinks and a pretentious sizing scheme (“Congrat-ulations, you’re stupid in three languages”). However, we’re handing a LAUREL to the coffee conglomerate Starbucks this 
week after it announced plans to hire at least 10,000 military veterans and active-duty spouses over the next ﬁ  ve years. 
According to the Seattle Times, “‘This is, in my view, not 
charity or philanthropy. But in fact, this is good business,’ (Howard) Schultz (Starbucks’ chief executive) said Monday in an interview at the company’s Sodo ofﬁ  ces. ‘These are highly skilled, highly trained people who have signiﬁ  cant leadership capabilities, who will add value to Starbucks.’”
All eyes have been on Gov. Chris Christie and his guber-
natorial win this week in New Jersey — a signiﬁ  cant achieve-ment that will set the stage for a possible Republican nomina-tion in the 2016 presidential elections. 
However, the newly elected governor attracted negative 
attention when he screamed at a public school teacher at a campaign rally this week. When the woman, an elementary school teacher named Melissa Tomlinson, asked Christie, “Why do you spread the myth that our schools and teach-ers are failing?” he responded by shaking a ﬁ  nger and yell-ing, “Because they are! I am tired of you people. What do you want?”
Harsh. According to The Washington Post, “Tomlinson’s ques-
tion seems like a fair one, given that New Jersey public schools overall have long done extremely well on the  metric that school reformers like Christie believe are the most telling about academic achievement: standardized test scores.”
Today, we throw a cool-your-jets DART at Chris Christie 
for his unpresidential behavior when confronted with a ques-tion he didn’t particularly like. 
Finally, we’re handing off an honorary Homecoming-
week LAUREL to the all of the UF students, faculty, staff 
and alumni here in Gainesville for the parade, Gator Growl 
and the football game against Vanderbilt. 
Let the Gator grrrrrrrrowl!

What’s the price of a se-
cret? 
Everyone can be 
bought, but some people are cheaper than others. Navy Cmdr. Michael Vannak Khem Misiewicz is one of those people, apparently. 
Saved from the Khmer Rouge killing ﬁ  elds 
as a child and adopted by an American woman, he returned to Cambodia in 2010 amid fanfare and international acclaim. 
Soon after he arrived at his post, though, 
he fell under the predatory eye of Fat Leonard — Leonard Francis — a Malaysian business-man whose company allegedly cheated the Navy out of millions of dollars with the help of Misiewicz. Francis is well known among the marine and business communities of Asia. His 70,000-square-foot Singapore home — the same size as Shaq’s mansion — is infamously decorat-ed every Christmas with obnoxious ornaments, and “any captain on any ship” that has sailed the Paciﬁ  c at least knows of him. 
According to its website, Fat Leonard’s naval 
contracting company, the Glenn Marine Group, “holds the distinction as one of the most trusted brands in the provision of maritime support, notably to the navies of the world.” and pro-vides essential services like fuel, food and main-tenance to ships traveling in Asia.
Fat Leonard bribed Misiewicz with prosti-
tutes and, in one instance, tickets to a Lady Gaga concert in Thailand. Then he used Misiewicz as part of a plan to extort millions of dollars from the Navy every year. He would email Misie-wicz, requesting that ships be redirected to ports where the Glenn Marine Group had operations. There, the com-pany would overcharge the Navy for its services, even creating fake tariffs to extort even more money. 
In Thailand, one of many countries where the group is active, the company was able to swin-dle $10 million dollars in just one year.  
Naturally, the Navy is launching a full in-
vestigation. Misiewicz and Francis have been arrested, as well as Francis’ manager of govern-ment contracts and a naval investigator accused of advising Misiewicz on how to avoid getting caught; he was also bribed with prostitutes.  
There is evidence Francis patronized other 
Navy personnel, and the full extent of the dam-age will no doubt be slowly and painfully re-vealed, starting with a hearing Friday.  
The case is as unsettling for the Navy as it 
is embarrassing; with a handful of Lady Gaga tickets and the help of a few sex workers, a guy called Fat Leonard was able to effectively con-trol the Navy’s ships and where they went in Asia.  
“Big bro” Francis held an esteemed Navy 
commander, “Little bro” Misiewicz, in the palm of his hand. What’s so disturbing about this scandal isn’t so much that a high-ranking naval ofﬁ  cer was bribed, though that would be bad enough — it’s the shockingly low price it took to do it that’s so disturbing. Military ofﬁ  cials have been corrupted before; usually they’re bought with a lot more than Misiewicz, and by other countries, not eccentric businessmen.

Navy sold out for hookers, ticketsColumn
I am a member of The 
Pride of the Sunshine. For eight-plus hours 
a week, I pour my blood, sweat and tears into band practice so that I, along with the other 364 members of the band, can help cheer on our football team each Saturday.
As members of the band, we all know 
how important it is to support the foot-ball team, no matter how badly a game may be going. I admit sometimes it is hard to stay positive — to keep cheering for our team even when it looks as if we are going to lose.  
But no matter what the ﬁ  nal score is, 
the band always ends each game with the ﬁ  ght song and the alma mater. It’s one of our traditions because we know we can’t only support the team when things go well. In fact, the team needs our support most when it is losing.
At the end of every win, the football 
players and the cheerleaders come over to the band and sing along to the alma mater, after which the band joins them in singing the ﬁ  ght song. The band then chants “Muschamp, Muschamp” over and over as he comes up to shake Dr. Watkins’ hand. In those moments, I feel an overwhelming amount of team spirit as we all come together to celebrate our school and our team.Unfortunately, we can-
not win every game. And when we lose, the team doesn’t come over to the band to sing with us. In-
stead, they immediately head to the locker room, heads down, as the band plays on without them. This has both-ered me as long as I have been at UF. Why doesn’t the team share in school spirit with us after a loss? I know that it is disappointing for the team to lose, but every Gator fan is disappointed as well.
The score shouldn’t affect our team 
spirit. Win or lose, I will always be a Gator fan. Our team could be 0-10 and I would still be proud to support our team. Losing doesn’t make the team any less important to the school. Losing doesn’t mean that we are not going to cheer on the team. Losing doesn’t mean that we should forget our school spirit. Instead of lamenting a loss, the team and the fans should celebrate our school’s tradition of excellence. We should all join together as one team, one school, one Gator Nation to sing at the end of every game.
We are all Gators, no matter the score 
— “In all kinds of weather, we all stick together for F-L-O-R-I-D-A.”

� UF CAN’T STOCK ALCOHOL.
MATTHEW RIVA
Alligator Staff Writer mriva@alligator.org
Getting ready for an artist or 
speaker means stocking dressing 
rooms and staging areas with some-times expensive items — items that can range from after-dinner snacks to appliances.
That means that, in one contract, 
one dressing room got stocked with several pounds of deli meats and cheeses, “an electric kettle — AB-SOLUTELY ESSENTIAL,” 48 12 oz. bottles of water, six bottles of Fiji water, four small glass bottles of San Pellegrino, and boxes of Triscuits, Quaker granola bars and gummies. Oh, and a “popular fashion or gos-sip magazine (surprise us!).”
Including everything but din-
ner, the total retail food cost before tax was about $150. Of course, the university only pays for this — with money from student fees — if your name is Matt Johnson or Kim Sch-iﬁ  no.
Requests like power pop duo 
Matt and Kim’s, who were paid $45,000 to perform at a canceled Summer show, are usually listed in hospitality riders. Riders are addi-tions to contracts that specify food or artist necessities that typically go beyond a provided meal.
Sam Hunt, an agent with the 
Windish Agency who booked Matt and Kim to play at this summer’s Swampfest, said these requests in-clude items for the entire entourage.
“For a band that has four people, 
you’ve got the four members of the band, the person running the sound. There’s the monitor person, there’s a tour manager, merch person, light person, and sometimes there’s a lighting tech, and a tech for instru-ment and gear problems, and one or two video techs, (and) a produc-tion manager,” he said. “A band that tours on a bus — their requests re-ﬂ  ect the entire touring party.”Some contracts, like Matt and 
Kim’s, include highly speciﬁ  c items. On even-numbered days, the band requires ginger ale, “P&G” and “Sleepytime” teas, Dijon mustard, arugula, hummus, whole wheat pita bread, Triscuits and gummy candy. On odd-numbered days, members want Coca-Cola, Earl Grey and chamomile teas, stone mustard, triple-washed spinach, bananas, guacamole, Special K chips, Wheat Thins and 70 percent dark choco-late.
In total, their hospitality rider has 
52 line items.
Other line items can range from 
simple requests like those of Daniel Tosh ($66,000) when he visited UF — four bottles of Smartwater and “a book you think Daniel might like to read” — to more elaborate, page-long lists like those in Matt and Kim’s and Passion Pit’s ($39,450) contracts.
Hunt said situations like this oc-
cur often because the band gets tired of eating the same food at each stop or because they want some peace and quiet while traveling.
“It’s not like they have a day 
when they wake up and say, ‘I hate talking to the common folk,’” he said. “It’s all relative to how you see the world around you.”
UF Assistant Vice President of 
Student Affairs Jeanna Mastrodica-sa said the university regularly con-tracts out these charges when bigger artists visit.
“As long as it’s legal, and it’s not 
unreasonable, we give it to them,” she said.
Alcohol, for instance, cannot be 
bought for the artists under state law. Everything else, she said, is up to the students negotiating the con-tracts to decide what goes.
“Students decide how to use stu-
dent fees — that’s the state law,” she said.
This includes paying for com-
modities like blenders, irons, toast-ers and full-length mirrors for Pas-sion Pit’s 2012 appearance.
Shontae White, who is often 
involved in the negotiation of art-ist contracts as assistant director of Student Activities and Involvement, said he didn’t know how much other Florida schools paid, but that there isn’t much chance for anyone to bring artists for less money.
“I don’t know that we get a ‘good 
deal,’ so much that there isn’t really a deal for these activities,” he said.
But as long as there is a demand, 
UF will supply.
“People like to harp on hospital-
ity riders, but they’re really the last thing that people are thinking about at all,” Hunt said.

A four-digit tuition bill at UF could pay off 
with a seven-digit salary.
UF ranked 49th worldwide for producing 
the most millionaires, according to research 
compiled by UK business magazine Spear’s and data research company WealthInsight.
To compile the list, researchers went 
through a database of 700,000 millionaires in 200 countries. 
The U.S. dominated the rankings with 63 
universities out of the top 100 universities in the world with millionaire alumni.
UF Career Resource Center Director Heath-
er White said UF’s academics as well as stu-dents’ skills used beyond the classroom con-tribute to students’ future success.
“The academics speak for itself at the Uni-
versity of Florida,” White said. “First, it’s so competitive to get in, and once they’re here they receive a very strong education. It’s a great foundation launching them into their careers.”
The survey also ranked the most prosper-
ous degrees, with engineering, master’s in business administration and law in the top three spots, respectively.
Lizi Lopez, director of recruitment and 
emerging leader development for entrepre-neurial program UF Enactus said the surpris-ingly high ranking could be due to UF’s status as the top academic school in Florida and high tuition value.
“It deﬁ  nitely goes to show the value that we 
get from our education and how well we’ve been set up through our colleges to be success-ful in the future,” the 21-year-old UF market-ing and psychology senior said. “I’ve probably never seen such an impressive fact about UF.”FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 8, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 9

Ernie Griggs was meant to ride.      
The 75-year-old started drag 
racing in Tampa in the 1950s when he was 18. He put his racecar away in the garage about four years later when he got married and had two sons. But he got back in the driver’s seat in 1984.  
“Everyone has an automobile, 
and everyone wants to see how fast it will go,” he said.
Some test their speeds on the 
streets. Others, like Griggs, use a track.Local drag racing outlet Auto-
Plus Raceway could be keeping Gainesville from having the illegal street racing problem other areas of Florida are experiencing.
“With persons interested in 
racing having the outlet of a legal place to do so … I think they are more apt to contain their racing to the track,” Gainesville Police spokesman Ofﬁ  cer Ben Tobias wrote in an email.
Auto-Plus Raceway is one of 
130 National Hot Rod Association member tracks in the country, and it’s considered one of the fastest. Although the local track hosts Ga-tornationals — an annual race that attracts thousands of spectators and racers — each spring, it offers a safe and legal place for drivers to race throughout the year.
Nate Cross, the sales and mar-
keting manager at the track, said its weekly Test & Tune events are meant to get people off the streets and into a safer environment. How-ever, he hasn’t heard about many incidents of illegal street racing in Gainesville.
Tobias agreed. He said the last 
recorded citation for street racing was issued May 10, but it didn’t in-clude details. Another citation was handed out Feb. 9, but, again, that incident didn’t have any details.
“The racing statute only re-
quires a citation be issued, and a police report is not completed on most trafﬁ  c citations,” Tobias said.
Under Florida Statute 316.191, 
the term “drag race” is deﬁ  ned as operating two or more motor ve-hicles from a point side by side at fast speeds in a competitive man-ner. Drag racing on a highway, roadway or parking lot is not per-mitted.
Cross said the underground 
racing world in Gainesville isn’t like those in Jacksonville, Orlando or Miami.
In Miami, one person was killed 
and three were hospitalized in Sep-tember in a three-way crash caused by drag racing, the Miami Herald reported.
Orlando’s underground scene 
has similar problems. In 2012, a man was arrested after a street racing accident left several peo-ple injured, the Orlando Sentinel reported. That crash came after Orange County commissioners unanimously voted to reject drag racing at the Central Florida Rac-ing Complex. Racers had hoped the complex would be a safer alter-native to street racing, the newspa-per reported.
Tobias attributed the lack of is-
sues in Gainesville to ofﬁ  cers ac-tively patrolling their areas in ad-dition to having the track close by.
To race at the track, all one needs 
is a driver’s license — and a car. 
But the kind of car? Well, that 
depends on the driver. People race dragsters, trucks, ATVs, motorcy-cles and snowmobiles.
Jack Matthews started racing 
in the 1980s with a motorcycle. He had been working in the insurance business for years and had buddies who raced. Matthews decided to give it a try.He switched to cars about seven 
years ago, and now at age 65 he plans to have his 1978 Chevy Nova ready to race soon.
In the about seven years he has 
owned his maroon-and-silver car, Matthews has spent about $70,000 tuning it. And the return on his in-vestment? He doesn’t know yet.
After spending one night at the 
track, he’s already out $60 when he pours ﬁ  ve gallons of gas in the tank. Before he closes the lid, he takes a whiff of the gasoline.
“That’s what drag racers love,” 
Matthews said.
Matthews always goes with his 
friend Terry Dolan, a 72-year-old South Bend, Ind., native. Indiana is known for its automotive indus-try.
“In that area, people just gravi-
tate toward racing,” Dolan said.
But Cross said Gainesville is 
also home to muscle car fanatics.
“A lot of people make a point 
to come race here throughout their career,” he said.
Unlike most patrons who visit 
the track, Cross has only been in the racing world for three years. Before working at Auto-Plus Race-way, he worked for the Philadel-phia Flyers.
Cross said drag racing fans are 
similar to hockey fans in that they come to experience the event. They are both avid, passionate groups of people who enjoy the show.
However, Griggs said drag 
racing is different. He said it’s all about friends, family and camara-derie. Both of his sons are racers, and his grandson Austin will be learning to race soon.
“As soon as I get him in a car, 
he’ll be here,” Griggs said.
Austin, 18, said he can’t start 
racing until his grandfather teach-es him.
But Griggs isn’t ready to be a 
passenger yet.

Gainesville Police arrested two men 
Wednesday after it was reported they worked 
together to steal a cash register and beer from a downtown restaurant. 
Ofﬁ  cers arrested 33-year-old John Paul 
Stauff and 30-year-old Brandon Anthony Herbert on charges of burglary and petit theft, according to a GPD arrest report. 
At about 6 a.m., police received an anony-
mous call that someone was breaking into the Lunchbox Café, at 104 SE First Ave., accord-ing to the report. The caller said the perpetra-tor was wearing a black hooded sweatshirt that said “Headhunter” on it.
Police found Stauff wearing the sweat-
shirt, according to the report. Behind Stauff was the cash register hidden under a blanket with several cans of Pabst Blue Ribbon from the restaurant.
Ofﬁ  cers took Stauff and his supposed ac-
complice, Herbert, to GPD headquarters for questioning, according to the report. During the interview, Herbert told police he knew the café was left unlocked and told Stauff, who then tried to gather a group to break in.
Stauff told police he broke in and stole beer 
but didn’t admit to taking the cash register.
One witness also told police he saw the 
two men walking toward the business saying, “We’re gonna get paid!”
Ofﬁ  cers booked Stauff and Herbert into 
the jail in lieu of $7,000 and $9,000 bonds.Police: Men stole register, beerCAMPUS

UF is catching up in the race to have 
“Catching Fire” screened in advance on 
campus.
With about 4,600 votes, UF is ranked 
ﬁ  fth, trailing behind Michigan State Uni-versity, University of Michigan, Ohio State University and University of Wisconsin. 
Still, Ferzan Uddin, who arranged the 
Facebook event to organize Gators to vote, said he feels conﬁ  dent that if the school doesn’t win, it will ﬁ  nish in the polls as one of the leading schools.
“I feel if we’re not No. 1, we will be 
high,” said the 19-year-old UF biochemis-try sophomore and member of the ﬁ  lms group in Reitz Union Board Entertain-ment, the organization trying to get the movie on campus. 
Uddin said it’s usually difﬁ  cult to get 
big blockbuster movies on campus, so RUB Entertainment looks for contests to get the movies to come to the school. “Catching Fire” comes out Nov. 22.
Ryan Pearson, a director of ﬁ  lms for 
RUB Entertainment, wrote in an email the showing would be a collaboration with Cross Culture Marketing, a contact in organizing the screenings. Pearson, a 21-year-old UF economics and political science junior, said UF was automati-cally entered into the contest, which he said is likely because of the school’s large size and participation in past advanced screenings.
“I am optimistic about our chances of 
winning the screening,” he said. 
Pearson said although there are signiﬁ  -
cant gains to make to catch up to Michi-gan State before the Nov. 15 deadline, it is not a far-reaching goal.

The P. K. Yonge Developmental 
Research School program for the 
performing arts has recently taken some of its drama off-stage. 
Kathy Byrne, an award-winning 
drama teacher with more than 30 years of experience, had her contract abruptly terminated with no ofﬁ  cial rationale. 
Her replacement will be Tif-
fany Dunn, a middle school English teacher at P. K. Yonge. Although an English degree is accepted by the state to teach drama, the decision has left many parents unhappy.
Susan Washington, who moved 
from Miami Beach when her 15-year-old daughter, Molly, was accepted into the performing arts program, has led the charge in confronting the administration about the issue.
“There seems to be a notion that 
the administration could hack away at the drama program and no one would notice,” she said. “But I think we’ve gotten their attention now.”
Students returned from summer break to ﬁ  nd their audition-only, advanced drama class had been dismantled and mixed into two, all-levels drama classes. The class was moved from the performing arts center to a “dingy” middle school classroom, Washington said. 
P. K. Yonge principal Catherine 
Atria said the relocation of students was due to the creation of a “dedi-cated rehearsal space.”
But the real concern, Washington 
said, is if the students will be able to compete. The transition from Byrne to Dunn violates Florida State Thes-pian rules, she 
said. 
In regard to 
the suggested dis-mantling of the drama program, there could be “nothing further from the truth,” said P. K. Yonge 
director Linda Hayes. She said the school has been working closely with organizers to ensure the stu-dents can compete. 
In a letter dated Oct. 29 and ad-dressed to P. K. Yonge competitors and their families, some concerns were alleviated.
“A change in troupe sponsor will 
not impact eligibility for individual, duet, monologue, or One Act com-petitions at the Florida State Thes-pian Festival in March,” wrote Ted Lewis, District 2 Florida Thespians director.
As for the main stage production, 
“The Craving,” if Byrne accompa-nies the production as a volunteer director, the school would be eligi-ble for state competition.

A couple of rejection let-
ters from NASA didn’t keep 
one retired astronaut and UF alumnus from getting to space. 
Col. Kevin Ford shared 
his experiences in space, gave encouraging words to engineering students and sparked heavy laughter Thursday afternoon.
He spoke for free to about 
200 people in the New Engi-neering Building. 
Ford discussed his time 
as the pilot on the two-week STS-128 mission to the In-ternational Space Station in 2009 and shared advice with aspiring engineers. 
Ford, who received a mas-
ter’s degree in aerospace en-gineering from UF in 1994, let the crowd have first-hand looks into what it is like to travel in a space shuttle. 
The audience saw videos 
of the interior of the space-craft, including footage of astronauts trying to eat cook-ies and pancakes that floated mid-air because of the lack of gravity. 
He said going into orbit 
was one of his most memo-rable experiences. 
“I couldn’t believe where 
I was,” he said. 
Before his speech, Ford 
received a distinguished alumni award from the De-partment of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at 
UF. 
Ford said he had to un-
dergo tests after landing on 
Earth because of medical is-sues, like losing bone mass, that can arise from traveling. 
He told students his col-
lege degree contributed to his space work. 
He later emphasized the 
importance of higher educa-tion and perseverance. 
Adam Batchelor, a 
19-year-old UF biomedical engineering sophomore, said at one point he wanted to be an astronaut. 
He said Ford’s talk was 
inspiring, and he liked seeing the inside of a spacecraft. 
Ford advised students to 
not just strive for a perfect grade point average but to make sure they are learning valuable skills. 
“Keep up the good atti-
tudes and keep working at it,” he said.

It was about noon when Josh John-
son and his wife opened their front 
door to one knock, three people and 15 new light bulbs.
Johnson said when a friend told him 
and his wife about a project that cut his electricity bill from about $400 to $250 last month, they had to sign up.
The project was done through a 
nonprofit organization called “We Are Neutral” that aims to lower the nega-tive impact of carbon dioxide emis-sions throughout the community.
Founder Jacob Cravey organizes 
local volunteers to retrofit the energy usage of tenants in government-subsi-dized housing. 
Cravey joined 15  volunteers Satur-
day to change the light bulbs, faucets, showerheads and insulation in about 30 homes in the Tree Trail Apartments complex at 2510 NE Ninth St.
He said the organization raises the 
quality of living in the community while lowering its carbon footprint.  According to We Are Neutral’s web-site, the build-up of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere causes “disastrously significant changes to the environment and human living conditions” by con-tributing to climate change.
“Any attempt at offsetting carbon 
is better than none at all,” Cravey said. “But I wanted to come up with a way that would make the biggest impact possible.”
He defined a “carbon offset” as any 
action taken that counteracts the nega-tive impacts of carbon dioxide. This could be anything from using less wa-ter to planting a tree.
By bringing volunteers to low-in-
come houses in the area, Cravey said his organization helps build cultural education, lower poverty and better the environment.
Cravey said he has partnered with 
UF, Fest and Bonnaroo Music & Arts Festival in creating “carbon-neutral” events. For each measurement of car-bon dioxide emitted during one of these sponsored events, Cravey said he tries to counteract the effects with some kind of a carbon offset.
He said he partnered with UF to 
create the first “carbon-neutral football season” in the history of the National Collegiate Athletic Association, and he hopes to tackle the entire Southeastern Conference.
“I thought the idea of using colle-
giate sports to bring attention to some-thing important was just brilliant,” Cravey said.
He said during the last five years, 
We Are Neutral helped save low-in-come families more than $3.5 million in electric bills and planted almost 20,000 native trees in Florida.
As he finished going from house to 
house, Cravey picked up his clipboard and assigned first-time volunteers, Brielle Martinez and Ryan German, to apartment 101. The two carried the last canvas sack of light bulbs, faucets, gauges and foam insulation to the door before Martinez knocked.
“We’re here to change your light 
bulbs and lower your electricity bill,” she said, and the tenants opened the door.
Martinez balanced on the balls of 
her feet to change a light bulb as 3-year-old Keihonest Perry, who lives in the house, darted between Martinez’s legs with a bright yellow Hot Wheels race car in hand. His brother Keith stood in the kitchen telling his mother every-thing she needed to know about the new kitchen faucet.
Martinez smiled slightly when she 
overheard the dreadlocked 11-year-old describe the new faucet.
“It’s just so rewarding to see the ef-
fects of what we’re doing firsthand,” she said.Local families save money,

By the end of the year, airline passengers 
will be allowed to keep their electronic devic-
es turned on during a ﬂ  ight, and Gainesville residents are reacting positively to the regula-tion change.
The Federal Aviation Administration an-
nounced last week the rules will soon allow passengers to use them on airplanes during the entire ﬂ  ight.
Passengers will eventually be able to read 
e-books, play games and watch videos with-out powering off their devices in order to al-low the aircraft to take off and land safely, according to an FAA press release. Although most portable devices will be acceptable, cell-phone usage is still limited.
Les Dorr, an FAA spokesperson in Wash-ington, D.C., said the Portable Electronic Device Aviation Rulemaking Committee, a group of industry and airline experts, met in January to observe comments about the regulation from the industry and the general public.
Dorr said JetBlue, Delta and American 
Airlines have been approved by the FAA and expects other airlines to be approved as well. 
Laura Fuller, a Gainesville resident, fre-
quent ﬂ  ier and software representative, said she uses ﬂ  ights as a time to work, and the previous regulation took away productivity time.
“I think it’s going to help people be more 
productive,” Fuller said. “It’s nice to have that continuity.”
Fuller said she often uses the ﬂ  ight time to 
read an e-book for pleasure as well.
“Even if I just want to relax and read a 
best-seller or something, I can do that on my Nook,” Fuller said. “It just gives me a lot more freedom.”In the committee report released in Sep-
tember, most of the comments proved in fa-vor of the new rule, Dorr said.
He said the goal was to examine if the 
present state of technology and use of elec-tronic devices could be expanded safely from gate to gate.
“Our whole concern was, ‘Could the use 
of (personal electronic devices) be expanded and be consistent with keeping the operation of the aircraft safe?’” Dorr said.
John Spence, a Gainesville resident who 
ﬂ  ies frequently, said he embraces the deci-sion because he enjoys reading e-books.
“It’s a hassle to have to shut them off for 
15 or 20 minutes while they taxi and take off,” said Spence, who travels 200 days a year and only ﬂ  ies out of the Gainesville Regional Air-port.
He said the biggest improvement to the 
new regulation is that pressure will be taken off of ﬂ  ight attendants who have to constant-ly ask passengers to turn off their devices.“I’m happy for that,” Spence said.Spence said the previous rule of turning 
off electronic devices seemed silly and out-dated.
“It’s not impacting the performance of the 
plane at all,” Spence said.
Strange facts about air travel:
• Most tools must be placed in 
checked bags. But small wrenches, pliers 
and screwdrivers are OK for carry-ons. 
• Most sports equipment must be 
placed in checked bags. But ice skates and roller blades are OK for carry-ons. 
• Most liquids and gels are prohibited 
from carry-ons, but snow globes the size of tennis balls are allowed as long as they  ﬁ  t inside a plastic bag.14, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 8, 2013
E-readers, tablets allowed after airlines lift electronics banELLY AYRES
Alligator Contributing Writer
The young girl, no older than 10, careful-
ly sorted her hand-picked lemons into small 
bundles and loaded them into the wheelbar-row. She pushed it down her Costa Rican street, invigorated, knowing this lemon-selling business was all her idea. 
She hoped someone along the street 
would buy the lemons, but for Rebecca Bar-borak, it was never really about the money.
Barborak couldn’t possibly know then 
that she was nurturing a passion for en-trepreneurship that would blossom into a growing art studio venture in North Central Florida. 
Almost 20 years later, Barborak opened 
two art studios in Gainesville, one on New-berry Road she calls Corks & Colors Studio and one at The Oaks Mall, called You Paint It.
Ask Barborak today if her after-school 
lemon business was a ﬁ  nancial success, and she’ll tell you she can’t remember. And that doesn’t surprise her, either.
“I don’t thrive on the idea that I’m going 
to make a lot of money,” she said. “I mean I hope I do, but I thrive on the whole creat-ing-a-business side. That’s where my happy place is.”
After graduating from UF in 2009 with a 
psychology degree, Barborak began work-ing as a job coach for people with disabili-ties for two organizations. Pooling together money from her ﬁ  rst salary and graduation, Barborak initially set aside about $600. It would be the ﬁ  rst of many smaller monthly investments put toward her future do-it-yourself art studio.
The ﬁ  rst Corks & Colors Studio class was 
held July 31, 2010 at a downtown Gainesville business incubator.
Her ﬁ  ancé, Josh Smith, agreed that life 
was a little hectic while the business was getting on its feet.
“I’ve never met anybody like this,” Smith 
said. “She’s just constantly thinking, putting those thoughts into action and making them happen.”
Though her satellite studio, You Paint It, 
closed with the end of summer, Corks & Col-ors Studio hosts about 10 classes a week.
In August, she moved her third location 
in Ocala, called DiY Studio, from a business incubator into the Paddock Mall.
Callie Watkins remembers last Valen-
tine’s Day at the Newberry location, when she and her boyfriend, Justin Jarrett, ended up at a portrait class.
“They guided us along how to draw 
someone’s face, and it’s not hard, even if you didn’t know anything about art,” she said.
And anyway, she said, the physical out-
come of the portrait wasn’t why they were there.
“I deﬁ  nitely didn’t care how it turned 
out,” she said. “But it was just fun to do and not necessarily what it looked like at the end.”
Liz Getman, who has been teaching art 
classes at Corks & Colors Studio since Feb-ruary, said Barborak’s enthusiasm and com-mitment to those around her, from her em-ployees to the customers, is uplifting.
“She’s constantly thinking of new ideas,” 
Getman said. “She’s a totally inspiring per-son.”
Being a business owner means accepting many uncertainties, from ﬁ  nancial instabil-ity to a stressful schedule of balancing work and home life. But Barborak said her strong work ethic and genuine enthusiasm for what she’s doing are what sets her and her business apart.
“I’m just extremely passionate about 
what I do, and I enjoy it thoroughly,“ Bar-borak said. “And I think because I love what I do, I’ve been able to deal with all the ups and downs of it.”FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 8, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 15

MICHELLE PROVENZANO

The Gators are trying to bring back the po-
tent offense and strong defense that led them 
to six consecutive shutouts during the regu-lar season.
After barely hanging on during its second-
round match of the Southeastern Conference Tournament against Arkansas on Wednes-day, Florida will need those qualities to beat a talented Ole Miss squad.
The Gators kept a clean sheet to earn a 1-0 
victory in a tough game with the Razorbacks but are looking for a more opportunistic at-tack when they face the Rebels. The two teams will square off in the semiﬁ  nals of the SEC Tournament today at 5 p.m. at the Orange Beach Sportsplex in Orange Beach, Ala.,
“We need to get back to one-and-two 
touch, playing for each other and working together defensively,” forward Savannah Jor-dan said. “I think if we do those things — es-pecially playing for each other and putting in a ton of effort — then I think we’ll be ﬁ  ne.”
The last time Florida faced Ole Miss, the 
Gators dominated the Rebels to earn a 4-1 victory on Sept. 27 in Oxford, Miss.
Ole Miss was no match for one of Florida’s 
most effective offensive rhythms all season.
Jordan scored the ﬁ  rst goal of the match 
and went on to earn her ﬁ  rst collegiate as-sist. 
The SEC Offensive Player of the Year will 
take on Rebels senior forward Rafaelle Souza, who ranks second behind Jordan in the SEC with 19 goals.
In Mississippi’s second-round match 
against Kentucky on Wednesday, Souza scored the second goal to earn the Rebels a 2-0 victory.
“One of the biggest things we need to 
work on as a team is communicating on the ﬁ  eld,” junior midﬁ  elder Havana Solaun said. “Having that, we can be very successful.”
If Florida beats Ole Miss for the second 
time this season, the Gators will earn their second consecutive appearance in the SEC Tournament title game and 11th in program history. 
“Every game, every tournament, it’s all 
important,” Solaun said. “[Winning the SEC Tournament] is just as important as winning the season title.”Florida preparing for tough Ole Miss team in SEC semiﬁ  nals

Will Muschamp announced via Twitter that Max Garcia, Hunter Joyer, Leon Orr and Trey Burton will serve as captains against Vanderbilt on Saturday. ADAM LICHTENSTEIN
Alligator Staff Writer @alichtenstein24
Jeff Driskel ran all over Vanderbilt last 
season.
The then-sophomore quarterback threw 
for only 77 yards but ran for 177 — includ-
ing a 70-yard touchdown scamper — in Florida’s 31-17 victory in Nashville, Tenn., on Oct. 13, 2012.
The Gators utilized the read option to 
perfection in the victory, accruing 326 rush-ing yards. 
More than a year later, the Commodores 
(4-4, 1-4 Southeastern Conference) are trav-eling to Gainesville. The only thing stop-ping offensive coordinator Brent Pease from running the option again is his own lack of options. Pease and the Gators (4-4, 3-3 SEC) are dangerously thin at quarterback.
UF already lost its starting quarterback 
for the season when Driskel suffered a fractured right fibula against Tennessee on Sept. 21. Since then, Florida has been riding red-
shirt junior Tyler Murphy’s right arm to both victory and defeat. After three consec-utive wins with Murphy at the reigns, the Gators have dropped three straight games to SEC opponents. 
Murphy has successfully run the option 
this season, but every time he holds onto the ball, Florida risks losing another quar-terback.
“You don’t want him (running),” Pease 
said. “He’s taking a lot of hits.”
It is a tough balance to strike. Murphy 
has proved valuable when he is on the run. 
Against Georgia, he rushed for 28 yards, 
gaining 56 yards total but losing 28 to sacks.
In the fourth quarter, the redshirt junior 
rushed two consecutive plays, gaining 39 yards and scoring a touchdown to bring the Gators within three points of the Bulldogs — the closest they came to tying the game.
“Sometimes, if I see a lane or something 
like that, I’ll try to break down things with my feet if they have good coverage in the back end,” Murphy said Monday.
However, Pease hesitates before send-
ing his quarterback running toward the de-fense.
When Driskel ran the Commodores to 
death last season, he had Jacoby Brissett backing him up. Brissett battled Driskel for the starting job for the entirety of fall camp and had experience from his freshman sea-son.
But now, Florida’s backups have no ex-
perience.
Behind Murphy is redshirt freshman 
Skyler Mornhinweg. The second-year back-up has never played a snap of college ball — much like Murphy entering this season.

Florida Southern, a Division II team that shot only 35.1 percent from 
behind the arc last season, sank three straight 3-pointers to kick off its 
exhibition game against Florida last week.
The Moccasins drained four more before the half, and then another 
six after the break.
Coach Billy Donovan hasn’t minced words this offseason about his 
defense: It is not, nor is it near, the defense from last year’s squad.
So with No. 10 Florida opening its season this afternoon against 
North Florida at 3 p.m. in the O’Connell Center, why would Donovan be happy after last week’s performance?
Because the medicine is easier to swallow when the games don’t 
count. 
“Well, I think it was really good, the fact that not only did Florida 
Southern take a lot of three-point shots, but they made them,” Donovan said. “Now, I did think in the game they made some very, very difficult, deep shots that probably caught our guys a little bit by surprise. But I’m happy they were able to make the amount of threes that they made because it was a great opportunity for us to show film and really use a lot of those things in terms of corrections and teaching points and those kind of things.”  
With the loss of graduated and suspended players, as well as the 
new hand-checking rule by the NCAA, which is expected to allow more scoring, Donovan has faced a tall order trying to build another top-five defense during the offseason.
But because the 20-year veteran coach has had an 
entire week to dissect the film in preparation for the 
season opener, Donovan said his team is more aware of its weaknesses and can address them before tip-off.
“Sometimes, the three-point line, you cannot de-
fend it very well, and if guys don’t shoot it well, it looks like you played pretty good defense on the three by their shooting percentage,” he said. “But you’ve really got to look at the quality of shots. You 
know, we were, inside the three-point line and even behind the line last year, a really, really good defensive team. And that’s an area where we’ve got to continually get better, and it starts from behind the line.”Donovan looking for better defense from GatorsListen up, pipsqueaks.

yond this sentence (Actually, we re-ally do. This is all an act).

We place a call to former Jaguars 
general manager Gene Smith, and voila! Stupid Joe’s had to deal with Blaine Gabbert for the past three sea-sons. Park your damn trike outside!
Boom. Character building.And then there is alligatorSports

just gross, man.

Before every game, Jillian Graff 
writes four letters on her wrist. 
FLHD: Fight Like He Did.
The phrase has been Graff’s 
motto for more than a year — ever since her father died.
“It’s just kind of like a remind-
er of him,” Graff said. 
“Whenever I see that and tell 
myself that, it kind of lights some-thing up in me that’s just like, ‘All right, I’m going to do this,’ for not only my team or for myself, but for him. I want him to always be proud of what I do.”
She never expected her father’s 
death to come so quickly.
After years of health complica-
tions that resulted in a heart trans-plant for sarcoidosis — an inflam-matory disease that caused scar tissue to build on his heart — and consistent radiation treatment for prostate cancer, her father died of lung cancer last year. 
According to the American 
Lung Association’s website, lung cancer is the leading cancer killer in both men and women in the U.S. About 160,340 Americans were estimated to die from lung cancer in 2012. 
More than half of people diag-
nosed with lung cancer die within a year of the their diagnosis.
John Graff had two weeks.He was diagnosed with Stage 
IV small cell lung cancer in June of 2012 at the age of 62. He never smoked a day in his life.
“It was during that time where 
you could just see each day was kind of a struggle for him,” Graff said.
“It’s a lot of emotions going 
through you. It’s a weird situa-tion because the last thing you want to do is see a loved one get weaker pretty much each day and see them heading towards the end of the tunnel, but at the same time you don’t want to be anywhere else. 
“You just want to spend those 
last moments with them, even though it is hard.”
Taking the time to embrace ev-
ery memory, thought and feeling with her father was something Jillian’s mother, Carole Nowak, strongly suggested.Nowak, a breast cancer sur-
vivor, said she felt guilty for not reminding her parents frequently how much she appreciated them before they died. She did not want Graff to live with the same regret. 
“I encouraged Jillian to take 
some private time with her fa-ther to hold his hand and tell him all the things she wanted him to know before his death,” Nowak said. 
“I really think it helped her 
after his passing to know that she got a chance to express all her feelings and thoughts to her dad.”
Graff was the embodiment of 
her father: soft spoken, calm and always smiling. 
But it was seeing those same 
qualities in her father during those final two weeks that made saying goodbye more meaning-ful.
“He was my biggest support-
er,” Graff said. 
“He just always thought I was 
the greatest thing in the world. He loved going to my soccer games. If he couldn’t make it, he felt so bad and was so upset over not be-ing able to go.”
That support continued when 
Graff made her freshman debut as a forward for the Gators in 2011.
When Florida faced Alabama 
at James G. Pressly Stadium on Oct. 9, 2011, Graff took control of the field after only eight minutes of playing time. She chipped the ball over Alabama goalkeeper Justine Bernier to score the game-winning goal in the 71st minute. It was her first collegiate goal. 
“I was probably the happi-
est person on the field when that happened,” Graff said.
Her father was so ecstatic he 
showed it to anyone and every-one in their hometown of Medina, Ohio.
“My dad actually took the re-
cording of that game and put it on iTunes, so whenever people would come over he would al-ways play it,” she said. 
Graff finished her first season 
with two goals and two assists. 
When her father died just 
weeks before her sophomore sea-son began, Graff was shaken.
“It was hard because it was so 
recent, at first,” she said. 
“When you’re playing and you 
get frustrated, there’s so much emotions that kind of all builds up and sometimes you just want to break down and cry. The team was definitely there, and they all supported me through it. 
“They helped me through the 
hardest thing I’ve ever had to go through.” 
Then-sophomore goalkeeper Taylor Burke was one of her teammates ready to lend a shoul-der for support.
Burke and Graff grew up to-
gether, played high school soccer together and were recruited by Florida at the same time.
“We always let her know that 
if she ever needed anything, that anyone and everyone on the team was there,” Burke said. “She didn’t necessarily have to take us up on that, but just the fact that she knew we were all there for her was something that made it easier for her.”
Graff added: “Having [Burke] 
here is very comforting. It’s like a piece of home coming with me.” 
When Graff came to Florida, 
she knew it was a tight-knit pro-gram. What she did not know was it would become a saving grace for her during the 2012 season.
“It definitely makes the days 
go by a lot better when you know can go to practice and you’re go-ing to walk into a family environ-ment,” she said. “That’s an im-portant part of what being a team is.”
Graff scored three goals in 2012 
while playing 395 minutes.
Her junior year brought more 
competition to the forward posi-tion, as Top Drawer Soccer’s No. 13 forward Savannah Jordan com-mitted to UF.
Jordan has since assumed the 
starting role, scoring 21 goals through 20 games.
“I do want to play, but there 
is no way I’d want to step on the field when she’s scoring all those goals,” Graff said. “I understand my role that I’m going to be com-ing off the bench for someone, so when I do go in, I try to make the best of it and live in the mo-ment.” 
Graff has scored two goals this 
season.
She said she stays positive and 
strong by reminding herself how hard her father fought through-out the remainder of his life and uses that as motivation.
“He had a quote he always 
went by: ‘It matters not how long the star shines, what is re-membered is the brightness of its light,’” Graff said. “It doesn’t matter how long you live as long as you enjoy the life that you get to live.”
That’s something she contin-
ues to live by.

center for the past two seasons, looks similar to Howard, who is arguably the best center in the NBA. Both players have chiseled physiques and are gifted with freakish athleticism.
But Gators coach Billy Donovan 
believes those comparisons have been unfair for Young since he ar-rived at UF in 2010.
“With him, it’s always a difﬁ  -
cult thing when those comparisons are being made to people that are NBA All-Stars and you haven’t even played a college game yet,” Dono-van said. 
“And that’s the expectation 
people are wanting him to live up to. I don’t mean this in a deroga-tory way toward Patric Young: He’s not Dwight Howard, and if any-one is waiting around for him to be Dwight Howard, they are going to be highly disappointed. Pat Young is Pat Young.
“For me, it’s never been about 
living up to expectations. It’s been more of him playing at a consistent energy level throughout.”
Florida fans keep wanting more 
and more out of Young, whether it be consecutive double-doubles or a better rebounding average. 
Young averaged 10.1 points on 
58.6 percent shooting and 6.3 re-bounds in 26.5 minutes per game last season, but he did not post consecutive games with at least 10 boards. 
When the Jacksonville native fails 
to post gaudy numbers, the criticism typically pours in.
“I’ve dealt with expectations 
since I’ve gotten here,” Young said during Florida’s media day on Oct. 9. “I think what I need to realize is that I am who I am.”
But since pushing his NBA Draft 
dreams to the side to remain at UF for his ﬁ  nal season, Young has made strides in many facets of his game.
He enters the season physically 
refreshed after undergoing surgery to remove bone spurs from his right ankle in April. Young played with the injured ankle during the latter half of last year, and it nagged him as the bone spurs worsened. The in-jury also led to tendinitis in his knees and limited his jumping ability. 
“I’m at 100 percent for sure,” 
Young said at media day. “There’s nothing hindering me from going out there and giving my best.”
Young is also lighter. The 6-foot-
9 senior dropped about 10 pounds in the offseason after weighing 255 pounds last year.
“His shape is better,” senior for-
ward Will Yeguete said. “His game is obviously improved. I think he’s really trying to focus on doing the right thing and being a good leader. And I think he’s done that since we started practicing. And he’s more vocal and he’s more consistent, and I can deﬁ  nitely see that in him.”
Mobility and maintaining a con-
sistent motor were issues for Young last season, but the senior was active down low during No. 10 Florida’s 110-88 win against Florida Southern in an exhibition on Nov. 1. 
During the victory, he recorded 
19 points and eight rebounds in 27 minutes.
Young also looked better from 
the free-throw line, making 7 of 10 attempts. He shot 48.9 percent from the foul line last season — the low-est percentage among Gators who attempted at least 30 free throws.
“He played at a real good inten-
sity level,” Donovan said. “That’s what he needs to do.
“He didn’t do anything spectac-
ular. He didn’t make all these great offensive moves. He did what he can do. I think if he plays with a mo-tor and he runs the ﬂ  oor and plays with that energy, he’s going to be an effective player.”
As Florida heads into its season 
opener against North Florida today at 3 p.m. in the O’Connell Center, the Gators need Young to anchor the team on both ends of the ﬂ  oor with the team shorthanded.
Point guard Scottie Wilbekin, 
forward Dorian Finney-Smith and backup center Damontre Harris are suspended indeﬁ  nitely, while guard Michael Frazier II (mononucleosis) is questionable for Friday’s game. 
Although the rotation currently 
looks thin, the Gators are prepar-ing for the long haul. They hope to reach the Final Four this season for the ﬁ  rst time since 2007 after falling in the Elite Eight for three straight seasons.
If they want to make their goal a 
reality, the Gators need Young to be a consistent and efﬁ  cient performer on the block — by just being him-self.
 “I just really want to play free,” 
Young said. “That sense of freedom, expectations, free of pressure, free of people telling me this and that. Just going out there and being the best Patric Young I can be by doing what I do best.”

Young: Wild and free entering senior season with Gators 26, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 8, 2013
Last year, the Gators allowed the sec-
ond-lowest three-point ﬁ  eld goal percent-
age in the Southeastern Conference, be-hind only the Crimson Tide.  Alabama’s opponents shot only 0.2 percentage points worse than Florida’s opponents.
Although North Florida’s 34 percent 
from behind the arc was tied for third low-est in the Atlantic Sun conference, center Patric Young said his team will need to sig-niﬁ  cantly improve its defensive rotations or the Ospreys will also take advantage of open shots.
“We were late on a lot of rotations and 
transition defense,” Young said. “Tran-sition defense probably being the No. 1 thing, because Florida Southern, you saw how fast they got the ball out of the net. We just have to be able to assume every team’s going to be that fast and have that sense of urgency to get back and, you know, ﬁ  nd a man.”
Injury updates: Michael Frazier II has 
not practiced with the team this week and was limited to individual, non-contact drills. The sophomore guard was diag-nosed with mononucleosis last week. Don-ovan said the decision for Frazier to play is up to the team’s doctors.
Although Kasey Hill has been dealing 
with back issues all week, he is cleared to play the opener, as are Eli Carter (leg) and Will Yeguete (knee).FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 8, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 27
UCF (-10.5) is going to take 
Houston’s lunch money be-
cause...
Blake Bortles has been bullying 
opponents all season and won’t stop now. The Knights have an-other opportunity to prove they are legitimate BCS contenders and will probably blow it, but maybe not. Right?
- Phillip Heilman
The Cougars (+10.5) will create 
some sleepless Knights at UCF because...
Texas A&M coach Kevin Sumlin 
used to coach at Houston. Maybe he accidentally left one of his old playbooks behind. Well, that’s all I have.
- Joe MorganNow onto the picks!  
Spending a second week atop 
the standings at 49-27-4 is alliga-torSports Staff Writer Joe “My girl-friend can kick your ass!” Morgan, who has a secret weapon at home. Let’s just say this guy spends some time in handcuffs.
Sitting in second at 47-29-4 is al-
ligatorSports Editor Phillip “How do you live like this?” Heilman, who found more than 30 old re-ceipts while cleaning out his car. Most of them read: “Two McChi-ckens (AT THE SAME DAMN TIME!) and an M&M McFlurry.”
Tied for second is alligator-
Sports Assistant Editor Adam “D-II, here I come!” Lichtenstein, who declared that he could crack the roster of a Division II basketball team. Sorry, bud. Most teams are probably looking for guys who can actually score.
Bringing up the rear of the alli-
gatorSports group at 43-33-4 is Staff Writer Adam “Why is my phone’s time wrong?” Pincus, who still isn’t quite sure about this whole “daylight savings time” thing. Yes, Pincus, it was 1 a.m. twice Sunday morning. Don’t worry about it.
In a triumphant rise from dead-
ass last to a tie with Pincus is the Orlando Sentinel’s Edgar “One more Stella” Thompson, who ... nah, we can’t tell y’all about that.
Next up at 42-34-4 is Fightin-
Gators.com’s Cody “What a joke” Jones, who was understandably not amused to hear Fredi Gonzalez was one of three ﬁ  nalists for N.L. Manager of the Year. Don’t worry, Cody. You’re one of our three ﬁ  nal-ists for Most Boring Man Alive.
In dead-ass last with a piss-
poor record of 40-36-4 is 247Sports.com’s Thomas “Photojournalist” Goldkamp, who snapped a picture of several fellow reporters with his camera phone Thursday. Whether he just needs art for his home or something more personal, we can’t say.Also in dead-ass last with a piss-
poor record of 40-36-4 is Inside-TheGators.com’s Bryan “3-6-9!” Holt, who expressed his affection for the Lil Jon banger “Get Low” this week. Holt knows a thing or two about getting low, if you know what we mean (He’s short).

after suffering from mono Junior played through pain
Pease said Mornhinweg — who en-
tered the season as the third-string sig-
nal-caller — has been receiving practice reps to prepare him for game action.
“You’ve got to 
kind of get him in rhythm within the game,” Pease said. 
“You probably won’t know that until — a lot like with Tyler — you’d be in the same sense as when Tyler came in when Jeff got hurt.” 
Despite Mornhinweg’s lack of experi-
ence, Pease said he has conﬁ  dence in the young quarterback. 
Mornhinweg was a three-star recruit 
with a 4.68 40-yard dash time, according to Rivals.com. 
But despite solid speed for a quarter-
back, Pease said Florida would have to change its strategy if the redshirt fresh-man came into the game, which has looked more likely in recent weeks.
Murphy has already had to play in 
pain this season. 
He suffered a sprained right shoulder 
against LSU on Oct. 12, and after play-ing against Missouri on Oct. 19, he took a week off from throwing to rest his shoulder. 
“In Missouri, I was in a lot of pain,” 
Murphy said. “It might have affected me a little bit.”
The redshirt junior said his shoulder 
is back to full strength, and he will likely be off and running against Vanderbilt. But all it takes is one hit to sideline Mur-phy for the season alongside Driskel.
“You got to be careful and protect 
him a little bit,” Pease said.
Added Murphy: “I usually try not to 
take off unless there is a reason.”MURPHY , from page 22
