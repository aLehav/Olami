  The votes arrived in bursts of tens, twenties, hundreds.  
One by one, candidates rolled into the Supervisor of Elec-
tions ofﬁ  ce.
  Almost every eye was on the projection screen until a 
single red bar slid higher than the rest.
  Then a future commissioner smiled.   Yvonne Hinson-Rawls was elected to the District 1 seat 
of the Gainesville City Commission on Tuesday with 1,126 votes — 54.29 percent of the total District 1 votes.
  However, two candidates won’t be able to relax just 
yet.
  The at-large 1 seat will go to a runoff because none of 
the eight candidates was able to secure a majority of the votes.
  Lauren Poe, Santa Fe College associate professor and 
former Gainesville city commissioner, and Nathan Skop, lawyer and former Florida Public Service commissioner, will face off in a Feb. 28 runoff election. They had the high-est number of votes, with Poe securing 4,402 votes and Skop earning 2,944 votes.
  A total of 24,864 people voted — about 25 percent of 
registered voters.

I-75 ACCIDENT

  The last couple of months contained 
some of the happiest moments in Chris-
tie Nguyen’s life, a life that came to a tragic end on Interstate 75 on Sunday morning.
  The 27-year-old lifelong Gainesville 
resident, whose name was released by the Florida Highway Patrol on Tuesday, was a UF alumna and a Santa Fe College student.
  Nguyen was headed north in a Toyota 
Matrix on Sunday. Jason Raikes, her boy-friend and a source of recent joy, died be-side her. He was driving.
  “Speaking to his parents and to my 
parents, it’s pretty clear they were meant to be with each other,” her brother Nel-son said. “[None of the parents] had seen them happier. They were very much in love. They were talking about settling down.”
  In addition to Nel-
son, Christie leaves behind her father, An-drew; her mother, Linh; and her 6-year-old son, a ﬁ  rst-grader at Kim-ball Wiles Elementary School. The Alligator couldn’t reach any of 
Raikes’ relatives, who, according to WJXT in Jacksonville, live in Richmond, Va.
  Christie was artistic and talented, Nel- Santa Fe student and boyfriend 
die together in I-75 accidents

� A THIRD BODY WAS DISCOVERED 
IN A DODGE PICKUP.

Alligator Staff Writer
The death toll is now 11 in the Interstate 
75 crashes that also injured at least 22 peo-
ple early Sunday morning.
According to the Orlando Sentinel, the 
Florida Highway Patrol announced Tues-day night that a third victim was found in a Dodge pickup. 
In the aftermath of the crash, the pickup 
was on top of a crushed Pontiac Grand Prix. Another passenger and the driver of the truck were also killed. Their names have not been released. 
The rise in the death toll is due to the 
continued investigation by the Medical Ex-aminer’s Ofﬁ  ce.
Other names and identities were also 
released by the FHP in the days following the incident.
The Medical Examiner’s Ofﬁ  ce released 
the remains of 22-year-old Vontavia Robin-son of Williston. 
A family believed to be from a Brazilian 
Restoration church in Georgia, travelling from a three day conference in the Orlando area, were also victims of the crash.
According to the Atlanta Journal-Con-
stitution, Edson Carmo, 38, was the pastor of the church and driver of a 2012 Dodge Caravan. His passengers included Roselia DeSilva, 41, Jose Carmo Jr., 43, Adrianna Carmo, 39, and Leticia Carmo, all of Ken-nesaw, Ga. They were all killed. Lidiane Carmo, 15, the sole survivor from the van, was still at Shands at UF as of Tuesday night.Death toll in crash rises to 11News Today

Chas Hackmann, a 19-year-old mechanical engineering sophomore, uses a green to-go box every day at 
Gator Dining.
� AN ESTIMATED 1,000 
ARE CHECKED OUT EVERY WEEK.
MATT BOLES
Alligator Contributing Writer
Gators are taking “going 
green” literally with on-campus 
dining this year.
Students have been able to use 
the reusable, green to-go boxes at Gator Corner Dining Center, Broward Dining  and the Reitz Union’s Home Zone since Janu-ary 2009, according to the Ofﬁ  ce of Sustainability website. 
The dining halls started to 
charge students 40 cents each for disposable boxes in August, and more students are checking out reusable boxes this semester.
Felita Sallet, 22, the lead ca-
shier at Gator Corner, estimated that at least 1,000 to-go boxes are checked out every week at Gator Corner. 
“We didn’t expect it to catch 
on like it did,” she said. “We had to order more boxes to keep up with the demand.” 
She said she didn’t know how 
many were checked out before the charge was implemented on dis-posable boxes.
Students check out a box if they 
want to take food to go, and as long as they don’t keep any boxes, they get their $4 deposit back at the end of the semester, according to Gator Dining Services.
The reusable boxes prevent 
about 14,000 containers from be-ing thrown out, according to a Gator Dining handout.
Hanah Eastwood, a 19-year-
old linguistics freshman, has used the green boxes about 20 times.
“Anybody who has a meal 
plan should deﬁ  nitely sign up,” she said.Campus to-go boxes

A man was almost robbed walk-
ing to his apartment in The Polos 
early Tuesday morning.
Jeremy Christian Barry, 18, of 
4330 SE 80th St., was arrested by Gainesville Police on charges for attempted robbery a quarter mile from the incident.
According to the arrest report, 
at 12:13 a.m. Barry ran behind the victim near the 2300 block of South-west 35th Place and demanded the victim’s money and phone. As the victim turned around, Barry de-manded money again, signaling with his right hand on his pants pocket that he had a weapon.
According to the arrest report, 
he told the victim, “Don’t make me pull this out.”
The victim told police a vehicle 
leaving the complex startled Barry, giving the victim a chance to run away.Police found Barry nearby with-
in minutes. When questioned, Bar-ry said he smoked crack in Phoenix Apartments and was walking to his brother’s house.
The victim identiﬁ  ed Barry as 
the person who attempted to rob him.
After he was arrested, Barry ad-mitted he was looking for drug mon-ey. He told police he approached the victim aggressively but denied implying he had a weapon. He was found with a pocketknife in his front right pants pocket.
Barry was charged with attempt-
ed robbery with a deadly weapon.
Bond was set at $30,000.
Man arrested, charged with attempted robbery in The Polosson said. Dancing was an outlet for her. She 
started when she was 4 or 5 and never really stopped. Ballet, tap, jazz — she did it all.
She performed with Dance Alive Na-
tional Ballet, and she usually took part in the company’s annual Nutcracker show at the Phillips Center for the Performing Arts.
She played the piano in talent shows at 
Countryside Christian School, the school’s former principal Bill Keith said. Her former teacher Gwen Keith said she loved to draw during class.
Christie and Nelson grew up in 
Gainesville and lived at 11113 W Newberry Road.
Mary D. Fletcher, a neighbor, said she 
sold the Nguyens their house in 1991. She re-membered Christie being quiet but thought-ful.
“She was a brilliant, absolutely brilliant 
girl,” Fletcher said.
She never missed a day at Countryside, 
where she attended from elementary school through high school. She was the class salu-tatorian in 2001. She was less than a point shy of graduating No. 1, Gwen said.
Christie graduated from UF in 2010 with 
a degree in Asian studies, and she earned a pair of business administration degrees from Santa Fe. She was taking an anatomy and physiology class at Santa Fe this semes-ter and dancing at the college.
“The dance program is just devastated,” 
fine arts department chair Alora Haynes said in a statement. “The dance program was like Christie’s family. My phone is ringing off the hook with students asking, ‘Is it true?’”
Christie was planning to become a phar -
macist, Nelson said. Andrew, her father, is a doctor with family practices in Newberry and Trenton.
“Our family is big into the medical field,” 
Nelson said. “That was one thing that inter -
ested her. She really wanted to pursue it. My father had an influence in that.”
Working at a pharmacy and living with 
Raikes — those were Christie’s plans for the future, Nelson said. That was her hap-piness.
“When you find someone — and of course 
she had her son — the idea of settling and planning becomes exciting,” Nelson said. “Being with Jason specifically: That’s truly been the happiest I’ve seen her.”
Nelson doesn’t know where Christie and 
Raikes were driving home from Sunday morning. 
Wherever it was, they left together.4, ALLIGATOR §  WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 1, 2012

A Gainesville man was arrest-
ed Thursday in connection with multiple bike thefts at UF and off-campus apartments.
Robert Kenneth Barton, 18, 
was taken into custody Thurs-day night by Gainesville Police, according to GPD Detective Tom Mullins.
Barton was stealing bikes and 
trying to sell them to local pawn and sport shops, Mullins said. 
He added that the arrest was 
made with help from Univer -
sity Police Department detective Hank Middleton and officer Ellen Duffy.During an 
interrogation, Barton said he stole as many as 10 bikes from UF and popular student apart-ments, Mullins said.
Barton was charged with or -ganized stolen property dealing, unarmed burglary of an unoc-cupied dwelling, fraud and petit theft.
Mullins said one of the bikes 
was returned because it had been registered with UPD. 
“We were able to compare the 
serial numbers,” he said. “It’s a really good tool for students with bikes on campus.”
Students are encouraged to 
register their bikes and report stolen ones to UPD. 
Decals are available to those 
who register their bikes, which Mullins said can help deter bur -
glaries and help UPD find bikes faster.

CRASH , from page 1Nguyen remembered for her talentsMore voters turned out to 
polls for this year’s election
city elections, when 14.87 percent of 
registered voters cast ballots.
Hinson-Rawls threw her hands in 
the air and yelled, “Thank you! Thank you!” as she embraced supporters.
Although she’ll take a short break, 
she said she has been researching some of the issues from her platform.
“I want to put them into some real 
plans for moving forward,” Hinson-Rawls said. “I want to be able to step in, day one, and start making re-sults.”
Ray Washington, a Gainesville law-
yer, came in second in the District 1 race and earned 479 votes. He said he plans to support Skop in the runoff. In the meantime, he’ll go back to work.
Armando Grundy, an Army vet-
eran, came in third with 469 votes.
Skop and Poe went head-to-head 
in debates and forums throughout the election cycle. Both said they plan to run a positive runoff campaign.
Poe said he’s elated he made it this 
far.
“To come in first place by a pretty 
wide margin shows that our positive, forward-looking message really reso-nated with voters,” he said.
Although he is exhausted, Poe said 
he and his campaign staff are deter -
mined to run a strong race. 
“It’s like winning the AFC-NFC 
championship,” he said. “You get to enjoy it for one night, but then you have to get ready for the Super Bowl.” 
Nathan Skop said he’s excited for 
what the next month will bring. He said he plans to win the runoff elec-tion by securing the support of his former opponents who ran on similar platforms of fiscal responsibility and government openness.
“This is the first step toward bring-
ing change and representative govern-ment back to Gainesville,” Skop said. “The runoff elections will be a referen-dum on change versus the status quo on the current commission.”ELECTION , from page 1Barton

� TRACK AND FIELD 
MEET WAS DELAYED    35 MINUTES.

Gainesville residents and 
businesses are still feeling the 
effects of Sunday’s series of car accidents that left 11 dead.
After the wrecks on Inter -
state 75, businesses tempo-rarily stopped production, athletic competitions were delayed and hotels paid to ac-commodate those who were stuck in traffic.
“The last thing they needed 
after seeing that mayhem was finally coming here to see their hotel room was booked,” said Tony Trusty, general manager of the Hilton University of Florida Conference Center. 
The hotel extended reserva-
tions overnight for those who were stuck in traffic because of the accidents, he said.
In addition to an extra 
night, the hotel provided a glass of wine to each patron to “ease the stress” caused by the traffic.
He said he doesn’t know 
if any guests were in the ac-cidents.
The hotel covered the 
expense of the extra night, Trusty said.
“Technically, there was a 
loss of revenue, but I don’t even look at it that way,” he said. “We chose the moral route.”
Some people weren’t able 
to get to Gainesville to sword-fight, eat fried Oreos or buy chain mail.
About 12,000 people at-
tended the Hoggetowne Me-dieval Faire on Saturday. 
That number dropped to 
9,500 Sunday, said Linda Pip-er, events coordinator with the City of Gainesville Division of Cultural Affairs.
She said she expects those 
who couldn’t make it over the weekend to be at the fair this weekend.
Some businesses have to 
play catch-up because of ac-cidents.
It took some employees 
of Swamp Head Brewery seven and a half hours to get back from an event in Jupiter when it would normally take them four, said Luke Kemper, founder and owner of Swamp Head Brewery.
Because they were so late, 
they were unable to spend the three hours it takes to clean equipment, Kemper said.
With six hours of prepara-
tion time needed, the brewery couldn’t get a batch ready for fermentation in time.
“It’s not going to be the end 
of the world,” he said. “We’ll just double-up one day.”
The traffic caused others to 
be late to work and tardy to meetings.
Sue Burzynski Bullard was 
late to a weekend of meet-ings when her two-hour drive from Orlando took six and a half hours.
The University of Nebras-
ka-Lincoln associate professor was coming to Gainesville to help decide whether the UF College of Journalism and Communications would be re-accredited. 
Then, I-75 became a park-
ing lot.
“As frustrated as I was, I 
consider myself lucky that I 
wasn’t in the crash the night 
before,” she said.
When people arrived in 
Gainesville, they still had to deal with delays.
The Jimmy Carnes Indoor 
Track and Field Meet  brought about 900 youth athletes to the O’Connell Center on Sun-day, but some athletes had to wait as others arrived late.
The event was scheduled 
to start at 8:30 a.m., but it started 35 minutes late, said Larry Holsey, director of the meet.
The meet’s organizers had 
to pay to rent the space from the O’Connell Center for the time they didn’t use because renters pay by the hour, he said.
After waiting 35 minutes, 
Holsey said, he and others de-cided to start the meet.
He said he had to scramble 
to find replacements for the officials who were late be-cause of traffic.
Officials, parents and 
youth athletes were talking about the accidents among each other, he said.
“It was on the hearts of a lot 
of people,” Holsey said. “Our hearts go out to the people. It was tragic.”

At the request of Gov. Rick 
Scott, the Florida Department of 
Law Enforcement has started an in-vestigation into the car crashes that claimed 11 lives on Interstate 75. 
Scott requested the investigation 
Monday, FDLE Communications Coordinator Keith Kameg said.
Investigators want to find out 
why the interstate was reopened a few hours after being closed shortly after midnight Sunday due to poor visibility. 
“During this tragic time, our 
thoughts and prayers should be with the victims and their fami-lies,” said a statement on the gov-ernor’s website.
FDLE’s Office of the Inspector 
General will coordinate the inves-tigation. When the report is com-plete, FDLE will turn it over to the 
governor’ office.
There is no 
timeline on the report, Kameg said, and he was unable to pro-vide further in-formation. 
“We got it yes-
terday and we’re 
putting it together today,” he said.
While there are many things in-
vestigators hope to find out about the cause of the crashes, some things are already known. The Alachua County Fire De-
partment issued no permits for con-trolled burns inside Gainesville city limits last week, said Gainesville Fire Rescue District Chief Jeff Lane. 
One permit was issued retro-
actively for a person using a fire northwest of Gainesville, but that fire couldn’t have spread to Paynes Prairie Preserve State Park, he said. 
The Florida Forest Service au-
thorized a 70-acre pasture burn near Archer, but it was quite far from Paynes Prairie, said FFS spokeswoman Ludie Bond.
Bond said controlled burns were 
ruled out as the cause of the fire on Sunday.

Shands at UF went on red alert 
at about 5 a.m. Sunday, shortly after 
poor visibility from dense smoke and fog caused crashes involving about 20 vehicles that killed 11 peo-ple.
The hospital’s emergency de-
partment received a flurry of calls from first-responders witnessing firsthand the Interstate 75 carnage. 
Be prepared for mass casualties, 
they said.
Immediately , the Critical Care 
Center activated its emergency alert system.
“People mobilized from through-
out the hospital,” said Dr. Adrian Tyndall, chief of Emergency Servic-es, “not just the emergency depart-ment.”
Shands’ Critical Care Center re-
ceived 22 patients, said John Pastor, spokesman for UF/Shands Com-munications. Of those, 14 have been released and eight remained in the hospital as of 5 p.m. Tuesday.
Tyndall said four trauma sur -
geons, emergency physicians, nurs-es and other staff worked together to handle the emergencies and comfort those involved in the accidents.
“There was a lot of sadness given 
how significant this was,” Tyndall said.
Despite that, Shands employees 
handled the situation like the emer -
gencies they deal with every day.
Patients arrived in intervals, he 
said, and the emergency room atmo-sphere was calm and orderly.
However, he said, workers at the scene played the most important role: They were the ones checking to see who was alive, who could be rescued and who could not.
“The EMS personnel manning 
the frontlines were the heroes here,” he said. “They saw something many never, ever see.”
Fortunately, Pastor said, the cha-
os of the crash site didn’t translate to chaos at the hospital.
The alert lasted less than three 
hours, but the effects of the crash linger. If needed, doctors and nurses have resources such as counseling to help them.
Health care providers aren’t im-
mune to these situations, said Lisa Merlo, a psychologist and professor at UF’s College of Medicine.
Like everyone, she said, they 
need time to rest and process their feelings.
“Medical personnel are still hu-
man beings,” she said. Emergency workers heroes in tragedy
Shands treated 22 patients“It’s not going to be 
the end of the world.”

43% NOTuesday’s question:  Are you going  to 
vote today?Rituals still have value in age of reason
Those of us who passed through the Plaza of the Americas last week observed one of the many pe-culiarities of college life. A cinder-block wall had 
been erected, each brick painted with negative terms such as “Jesus freak” “useless” and “terrorist.”
The project, dubbed “Writing on the Wall” is an an-
nual exercise meant to raise awareness of hurtful phrases and increase mutual respect. This project serves as a con-stant reminder of the importance of ritual in the human experience.
When I saw the wall for the first time, marveling at the 
flagrant profanities scrawled on it, I could only shrug my shoulders and walk on. My time in academia has made me accustomed to feeling like a pilgrim in a strange world. However, when I learned that the wall was meant to be torn down in a ritualized ceremony, it made perfect sense. 
The university campus is, in a sense, the climax of the 
modern age. Since the Enlightenment, the Western world has been pining to throw the yoke of old and stodgy tra-ditions off its back. We have embraced reason and logic and rejected the overly pious religiosity of the medieval period. 
Sure, there are some backward holdovers — the right-
wing fundamentalists, the street preachers and the Lud-dites — but they represent a small niche on campus, and we all attend class in an environment where Robespierre would feel right at home. 
However, we still have our rituals. We no longer light incense or pray to the Virgin Mary 
— we’re much too clever for that. We do something much more sensible (or so we think) — we build walls just to tear them down.
These rituals are a constant reminder that  humans 
have always had mechanisms to cope with inner deprav-ity. Our ancestors would pray and fast, yet as they moved into the age of reason such things began to appear quaint and illogical.
However, the deep need for 
ritual still overcomes us. 
The “Writing on the Wall” 
project is a perfect example of this. These practices are often meant to raise “awareness” of a societal blight — in this case, in-tolerance and incivility. One is forced to wonder whether lack 
of awareness of such things is truly the problem. 
Do we slander and curse each other because we are 
unaware that such things are harmful, or do we do so because we have no fear of a deep and binding code of morality? 
No matter what theory to which one ascribes, both are 
expressed through the aforementioned custom of ritual. 
I was fortunate enough to pass through the Plaza 
of the Americas when the painted wall came crashing down. A large crowd had gathered, and a charismatic figure was holding a megaphone. 
“Four,” he began, and the crowd shouted in uni-
son, “three, two, one!” The ropes were pulled, the wall creaked and the cinder blocks, marred with their obsceni-ties, came crashing down in a pile of rubble. 
The crowd shared in a cathartic release in the wake 
of the spectacle. Is it not odd that in the supposed age of reason, we still put so much value in these ritualized machinations that serve no purpose other than to remind us of what we value? 
Pulling down a painted wall will not salvage our cul-
ture’s civility, yet we believe it can, because even the most secular among us are still religious by nature. No matter how many gods are forgotten, all of us still believe in the cleansing power of a communal ritual.

Media obsessed with 
non-issues in GOP race
Last night, the plurality of Florida Republican voters de-cided that Mitt Romney should be the nominee for the GOP . 
While yesterday’s election might be important to a can-
didate like Santorum, who has to decide whether he has the resources to remain competitive (his best showing was in Iowa), Florida’s 50 delegates do not mean much in the grand scheme of things. 
So far, only 5 percent of the 2,224 delegates have been allot-
ted to candidates in this race. There still is a long way to go, and the campaign will probably only get worse. 
As the remaining candidates struggle to take on the Rom-
ney machine, the attacks will get dirtier and more personal, although they have been pretty bad already. 
For the remainder of this campaign, we would like to 
simply ask the candidates one thing: Why aren’t you talking about the issues?
While the candidates try to prove that their opponents are 
really liberal wolves in conservative sheep’s clothing, a lot of serious issues are being pushed aside for more mundane top-ics. 
The whole fiasco with Gingrich’s ex-wife was just plain sil-
ly and did not present any new information. And what does releasing the candidates’ tax returns possibly tell us about how they will perform the duties of commander-in-chief?
Part of the blame should be placed on the national media, 
which focus almost entirely on the latest poll numbers or the latest attack ad. 
This is not to say that negative campaigning should be pro-
hibited or even discouraged. Negative campaigning brings a lot to elections, giving voters more information about can-didates and occasionally mobilizing them to go to the polls.  However, the debates have become one negative ad sound-bite after another. Rather than asking the candidates serious questions about the issues, the moderators have spent a sub-stantial amount of time discussing the content of negative ad-vertising and disparaging statements. 
Again, part of this could be the fact that the issues were 
given serious consideration at the beginning of the race, some three or four years ago during the first debate. There have been 25 debates so far in this primary, yet nearly none of the previous debates spent much time talking about issues.  
For instance, wouldn’t it be interesting to find out what 
the candidates plan to do to reduce the debt? We have heard vague generalities about cutting spending and reducing the size of government, but we rarely hear specifics from any of the candidates about what they want to cut or when. 
The country is going broke, and the media wants to focus 
on open marriages and tax returns. Perhaps we should give priority to things that matter.

The story of the Titanic has captivated the world for nearly a 
century — so much so that the tragedy became a pop cul-ture icon with the release of the 1997 movie, “Titanic.” The 
film spent 15 consecutive weekends at No. 1 in the box office and earned more than $600 million in the United States — a figure that made it the highest grossing domestic film in U.S. history for 11 years.
The reasons for the widespread interest are clear: The Titanic’s 
fate was a terrible disaster with serious human and material costs. There is also the painful irony that the “unsinkable” sank on its maiden voyage.
There is more to the story of the Titanic than irony or persistent 
idolization, however. The Titanic is not an isolated story or a ter -
rible turn of fate. Rather, its lessons hold credence and value for the modern day . It is a story that’s mistakes, while repeated, yearn to be understood and recognized.
The Titanic was deemed unsinkable because it was so massive 
and outfitted with an innovative safety design to prevent water infiltration in the event of a breach. Yet it was this view of the Ti-tanic that led to its destruction. Other ships gave warnings about icebergs in the Titanic’s path, but the captain made no effort to re-duce speed or change course. In fact, a governmental investigation conducted after the tragedy blamed the captain for traveling too fast through an ice field.
Furthermore, there is an unconfirmed report that the captain 
wanted to break the record for fastest trans-Atlantic crossing. The Titanic did not sink because it was structurally weak. It sank be-cause it was immensely strong — so strong that those in charge of commanding the ship felt it could withstand anything.
That conclusion is the important takeaway from the Titanic’s 
story, and it shows how important human actions and decisions remain in a world of technological and innovative genius. It is a story that has been mirrored most recently in the Costa Concordia disaster. No matter how big, powerful or techno-
logically advanced the ship, human agency remains crucial. When people are trusted with the responsibility of commanding a ship that can, today, effectively command itself, training and human at-tention to detail should be increased, certainly not decreased.
Costa Concordia was a very modern, safe ship built in 2006 and 
operated by Carnival Corporation, one of the largest cruise compa-nies in the world. If anything, like the Titanic, it could have been termed unsinkable, as could most of the massive cruise ships in operation globally.
As with the Titanic, it was not a weakness of design or construc-
tion, but rather a greatness of design and construction that instilled in the ship’s operators the complacency that caused the tragedy. In a 2010 interview with a Czech newspaper, Concordia Captain Francesco Schettino said, “These days, everything is much safer. It is easier to navigate thanks to modern technical instruments and the Internet.”
It was reported that Schettino deviated five miles from the usu-
al route to pass closer to the Italian island of Giglio. Some speculate this decision stemmed from the captain’s desire to show off the ship to the island’s citizens. It also may have been a nod to the Con-cordia’s chief waiter, who comes from the island and hoped to pass close enough to wave to family members.
Schettino claims the rocks that ultimately damaged the Concor -
dia were not on his nautical chart, and that when he saw them with his naked eye the ship was already about to crash. Regardless, the captain deviated the ship from the planned route and brought it too close to land. He relied on nautical charts rather than pure com-mon sense, and the ship’s prowess gave him a false sense of secu-rity . Like the Titanic, the Concordia was too safe and too durable in its commander’s eyes — it was “unsinkable.”
Thus, if there is anything to be learned from the demise of the 
Concordia and Titantic it is this: No matter the technology , size or power, human decision matters. It is a lesson that must be ap-plied in the context of all human endeavors. With advanced tech-nology and power, the responsibility for all of us to make rational and calculated decisions must increase. In a world filled with com-plex economic, social, political and military models — a world that seems so easy to put on autopilot — we must always remember that human decisions and behavior are still the most vital factors. 
Nothing is unsinkable.Jamie Dailey is a columnist for the Cavalier Daily at the University 
of Virginia. Nothing is unsinkable: 
Technological advances demand more attention Last Thursday, Rudy Giuliani’s talk about lead-
ership was led astray when a man had some questions about the 9/11 terrorist attacks. 
The man stood up and demanded, “What hap-
pened with Building 7, Rudolph?”
The man had a good question, even though he 
asked it in the wrong way by interrupting Giu-liani’s talk. 
His behavior was unseemly in the context of 
Giuliani’s speech and probably didn’t do much to help his worthy cause.
But what needs to be addressed is Giuliani’s at-
titude toward the questions themselves. 
To another audience member, Giuliani respond-
ed, “Oh, get lost. It seems like I’m in New York. This could be Times Square. Any more clowns?”
The man was then harassed by other audience 
members, and something tells me that it was for more than interrupting Giuliani’s speech: boos started pouring in as soon as “Building 7” came out of the man’s mouth.
The attitude Giuliani and the crowd exhibited is 
what someone might expect from antagonistic chil-dren. 
Giuliani’s response, “May I suggest a barber?” to 
a sincere question about 9/11 is the standard misdi-rection faced by those seeking truth about 9/11. 
First, may I suggest Rogaine to you, Mr. Giuliani? 
(Do you see the pointlessness of ad hominem?) 
Second, may I suggest not mocking a fellow 
American who is asking a sincere question regard-ing a day of such great tragedy as 9/11?
Third, to anyone convinced our government is 
incapable of lying to its constituency, may I suggest an education?
Or perhaps you can simply make a Google search 
on the Gulf of Tonkin incident or Operation North-woods? 
Uncertainty regarding the 9/11 Commission Re-
port’s veracity is nothing to scoff at. 
In 2006, Scripps Howard News Service and Ohio 
University conducted a poll of 1,010 adults and found that 36 percent of respondents thought it “very likely” or “somewhat likely” that federal offi-cials took part in, or took no action to stop the 9/11 attacks“ because they wanted the United States to go to war in the Middle East.” 
So, you say you want a new investigation opened 
on 9/11 — an investigation not designed to protect the ineptitude of the fed-eral government like the 9/11 Commission Report? 
Well, according to Giu-
liani, rudeness is appar -
ently a sufficient reason to deny people answers about 9/11. 
So, don’t be rude, or 
your questions, like those 
of countless other reasonable Americans, will fall into limbo. 
And don’t take the middle route of a firm, reso-
lute investigation that most “truthers” take either, or you will be made irrelevant and derided by a massive herd of childlike people. 
As you might have noticed, there is no right way 
to question the 9/11 Commission Report. 
Every approach will lead to oblivion or derision 
by those who possess an attitude of arrogant confi-dence in the government. 
And that attitude  is shamefully accompanied by 
the misguided idea that questioning the 9/11 Com-mission Report is somehow un-American.
That is, of course, just another duplicitous, illogi-
cal attempt to shift attention from the questions to the questionnaires.
Was 9/11 an “inside job” as asserted by the most 
extreme truthers? 
Probably not. Is the public’s knowledge about the circumstanc-
es preceding and following 9/11 complete? 
Probably not.But neither of these questions is certain to any 
reasonable degree. 
Because these are difficult questions — questions 
that make the federal government vulnerable — they are left in limbo or snubbed entirely. 
But, make no mistake: A polled 36 percent of 
Americans have doubts about the 9/11 Commis-sion Report.  
And as long as our troops are in war as a direct 
result of that day, the questions need to remain alive. 
Meanwhile, the investigation into 9/11 is not 
complete.

When Paul Favini laughed, ev-
eryone knew.
The loud, infectious sound would 
escape his office through his always-
open door and echo in the hallways in the Nadine M. McGuire Theatre and Dance Pavilion. 
“You could just hear it, and you 
just knew that was Paul’s laugh,” said Tony Mata, head of musical theatre. “It was just wonderful to hear.”
Favini, interim director of the UF 
School of Theatre and Dance, died Sunday after a nearly three-year battle with cancer. He was 51.
Favini’s colleagues and students 
at UF remember him fondly.
“He was a real gentleman, in 
the truest sense of the word,” Mata said.
Favini grew up in Scranton, Pa., 
and received a bachelor’s degree in business administration/marketing from the University of Scranton in 1987. He graduated with a Master of Fine Arts degree in costume design from Indiana University in 1997. 
Favini came to UF in 2000 and 
became an associate professor of costume design in July 2006. In 2010, he was appointed director. 
He was a center of calm in the 
bustling costume workshop, said Stacey Galloway , assistant professor 
of costume design 
and technology . 
Favini had 
an eye for detail. His bold designs were collabora-tive and creative, she said.
He designed 
costumes for 
more than 60 shows, according to his resume.
“He was phenomenal,” said John 
Reger, Favini’s partner of 11 years. “He should have been a Broadway designer. He should have a Tony Award.”
The school was his life. The hard-est part of becoming director was that he was no longer in the class-room, Reger said.
But Favini never lost his connec-
tion with students.
“He really knew how to listen,” 
said Josh Sallerson, a dance senior.
Now, the school feels incomplete 
without Favini’s presence. It’s like missing a family member, Sallerson said.
“He always had a joke for any 
little situation, and it was always a very funny, sarcastic joke,” said his stepson, Britton Reger.
Favini and his jokes will remain 
with his family and friends despite his absence.
“He will always be here with us 
in spirit,” Mata said. “We loved him very, very, very much.”
There will be a celebration of 
Favini’s life at the Constans Theatre in February.

morial fund can be sent to UF’s Office of Development, P .O. Box 115800, Gainesville, Fla., 32611.Faculty member remembered for laugh, work

With his entire starting rota-
tion returning from a success-
ful season, few college baseball coaches will be as comfortable as Kevin O’Sullivan when settling into the dugout for the start of weekend games.
But after Hudson Randall, 
Karsten Whitson and Brian John-son, the questions begin. 
Following the 2011 season, the 
Gators lost five pitchers — four juniors — to the Major League Baseball first-year player draft. Nick Maronde, Anthony DeScla-fani, Alex Panteliodis and Tom-my Toledo were all chosen in the 
draft’s first 11 
rounds. 
T o g e t h e r 
with senior Matt Campbell, the group com-bined to give the Gators 203.1 innings last sea-
son. 
Their departures leave a 
pitching puzzle for O’Sullivan to solve.
“First, we’ve got to figure out 
who our midweek starters are go-ing to be,” he said. 
“From there, we’ll figure out 
our middle relief. I’m real excited about those guys that were fresh-men last year: Daniel Gibson, Jonathon Crawford and Keenan Kish.” 
The trio enter the 2012 cam-
paign with green resumes. Gib-son, Crawford and Kish com-bined to throw just 28.1 innings as freshmen and had mixed re-sults. 
Kish showed promise, allow-ing just one earned run over 14.1 innings of work for an ERA of 0.63. 
The same couldn’t be said for Gibson, who saw his ERA bal-loon to 13.06 in limited action, in-cluding surrendering five earned runs in a 14-1 loss to Vanderbilt on May 14. 
“It’s really going to come 
down to these spring practices and scrimmages to see who is outshining the others,” Randall said. 
“We’ve got some good options 
right now.”
Comfortable with what he 
has at the back end of his bull-pen with senior Greg Larson and juniors Austin Maddox and Ste-ven Rodriguez, O’Sullivan’s fo-cus has become almost entirely directed toward freshmen and sophomores.
The midweek question that 
could sort everything out might be coming in the right hand of a hard-nosed former hockey player from East Milton, Mass. 
Johnny Magliozzi, a hard-
throwing and stocky 20-year-old freshman could very well be Florida’s leading candidate for a midweek starter.
“Johnny being an older kid, 
he really has a sense of maturity out there on the mound,” Randall said. 
“[Magliozzi] knows what he’s 
doing a little bit more. It’d be nice to see a little bit of improvement from the fall. 
“I expected more of him, and 
I’m sure he’s going to deliver this spring.”
With a little more than two 
weeks before the Gators’ first game, O’Sullivan admits that many of these pitching questions may not be ironed out until four weeks into the season when Flor -
ida opens Southeastern Confer -
ence play. 
Even then, he admits that be-
ing able to bring one of his clos-ers in as early as the seventh in-ning if things get dicey is a major advantage he will not be afraid to use. 
“I don’t see why we wouldn’t 
stretch those guys out for two in-nings and then we’ve got some options the next day,” he said.

There were times last season when Will 
Yeguete felt like a single mistake would 
land him on the bench.Though he was a freshman and still 
just a couple years removed from living in his native France, Yeguete’s playing time wasn’t cut by a language barrier or lack of chemistry with his new teammates. If any-thing, he quickly became known for his de-fensive aggressiveness and a good habit of hustling in practice.
However, none of those qualities helped rid Yeguete of a bad reputation when-ever he was passed the ball. Each time the 6-foot-7 forward tried to dribble or fire 
a pass, Florida coach Billy Dono-van expected the worst. 
“His biggest problem a year ago was he 
led our team in turnovers per minute and it became very difficult to play him, because, when he touched the ball, there was a good chance he was going to turn it over,” Dono-van said.
While Yeguete saw the second fewest 
minutes on the team — ahead of only walk-on Kyle McClanahan — he still gave away the ball 19 times and in a team-high 29 per -

National Signing Day
2012National Signing Day is finally here, and Florida will ink its first full class under coach Will Muschamp 
today. To get you ready, we have compiled a list of UF targets to keep an eye on throughout the day. Several announcements will be shown nationally on ESPNU. 
Dante 
Fowler Jr.6-foot-3, 232 pounds
Position:   Defensive end
High school:  St. 
Petersburg Lakewood
Also considering : FSU 
commit, but could ﬂ  ip to 
UF or USC.
Announcing: 10 a.m. 
After a so-so senior season and discipline issues, 
Fowler had a chip on his shoulder. He has been noted for his explosiveness off the ball and talent as a pass rusher, and could be used as a three-down defender soon into his collegiate career, depending on which school he chooses. 
Leonard 
Willliams6-foot-5, 254 pounds
Position: Defensive end
High school:  Daytona 
Beach Mainland
Also considering : Auburn, 
USC
Announcing: 11 a.m.
Williams could be considered another Auburn lean at 
this time, especially given new defensive coordinator hire Brian VanGorder. But, after he canceled a trip to Miami this past weekend, Florida and USC appear to be the ﬁ  nal two options. After losing out on some end options, Williams would be a huge get for UF. 
Tracy 
Howard5-foot-11, 175 pounds
Position:  Cornerback
High school:  Miramar
Also considering : FSU, 
Miami
Announcing:  9:50 a.m. on 
ESPNU
After Howard had a great visit to Miami, Florida 
seems to be falling slightly on Howard’s board but still in the lead. He displays great zone and man coverage as well as nice footwork. Despite his size, he is a force against taller receivers, too. This would be a big add to Florida’s 2012 class.
Nelson 
Agholor6-foot-2, 180 pounds
Position:  Wide receiver 
High school:  Tampa 
Berkeley Prep
Also considering : USC, 
FSU, Notre Dame
Announcing: 12:05 p.m. 
on ESPNU
A lot of hype has followed Agholor as he made a name 
for himself through crazy, highlight-worthy plays for a small school. While a great athlete, playing running back and wideout at the prep level hasn’t allowed him to lock in at a speciﬁ  c position yet. If he does commit to UF today, as many expect, he could provide the Gators with a ﬂ  ashy new playmaker — something Gainesville hasn’t seen in a while.
Stefon

Diggs is a natural playmaker, and represents one of 
Florida’s biggest personnel needs. Similar to Agholor in the hype aspect, Diggs is another player UF needs just to generate excitement again. Playing at a school stacked with talent, Diggs has polished his receiving skills and should be ready to contribute immediately. Many expect Diggs to choose the Gators.targets

While Florida’s staff has pushed hard for Clemons — 
coach Will Muschamp went to church with his family and assistant coach Brian White spoke at his football banquet — all signs point to Clemons signing his letter of intent to the Bulldogs. If he were to commit to Florida, the defense would beneﬁ  t immediately.

Young is quick, has great hands and could develop 
into an elite lineman with some bulking up in a college weight room. With oral commit tackle D.J. Humphries on the Gators’ roster, though, Young may not be too convinced that he has an opportunity to immediately contribute at Florida.

If he wanted to become a play-
er Donovan could trust, Yeguete 
knew he needed to make better decisions.
Now a sophomore and seeing 
starter’s minutes in four straight games for the Gators, Yeguete is turning the ball over just 13.6 per -
cent of the time and has limited himself to 13 giveaways over UF’s 21 games.
“I just slowed down, just tak-
ing my time on offense,” Yeguete said. “And sometimes when you see somebody’s open but you try to rush the pass, just make sure and take your time passing the ball.”
Donovan has relied on Yeguete 
to start nine games this season in place of forward Erik Murphy and, most recently, injured cen-ter Patric Young. In the extended minutes, Yeguete’s teammates have grown more confident in giving him touches on offense.
“He’s made tremendous prog-
ress and coach has continued to work with him,” said senior guard Erving Walker. “He’s done a great job since he’s been here. Last year, we were a little deep-er at his position and he worked hard every day in practice. He’s getting the opportunity this year, and I think that he’s making the most of it.”
While Donovan said Yeguete is 
far from becoming a feared scor -
ing threat, the drop in turnovers has allowed the Gators to use his defensive skill-set more. Yeguete ranks second on the team with 25 steals and he also has seven blocks on the season. 
Against Mississippi State last 
Saturday, Yeguete held the Bull-dogs’ leading scorer Arnett Moul-trie below his season average and forced his worst field-goal per -
centage in eight games. Donovan praised Yeguete’s ability to keep Moultrie away from the basket and not give up deep entry passes in the post.
“Once Will gets a guy in an area of the floor where he’s away from the basket, he’s good enough physically to take on contact and then obviously he’s really good with his hands in terms of slap-ping and deflecting balls,” Dono-van said. “So he’s a really, really good defender. As good of a post defender as I’ve had since we’ve been here. He takes great pride in taking on those challenges.”

Junior Ashanée Dickerson was named SEC Gymnast of the Week on Tuesday for  the 
third time in her career, following an all-round victory in UF’s quad meet last week.
� SHE WON GYMNAST OF THE WEEK.
LANDON WATNICK

With all of the firepower the Gators piled up 
this season, Ashanée Dickerson fell a little un-
der the radar before last Friday’s meet.  
Then she made a resounding statement in a 
resounding win. 
As an all-around competitor, Dickerson 
scored a 39.60 to pick up her first all-around title of 2012 and her 11th as a Gator in UF’s im-pressive victory against top-ranked Arkansas, No. 24 Maryland and Bridgeport. 
Dickerson also won a share of the floor exer -
cise title (9.95) with freshman Kytra Hunter and tallied a career high on uneven bars (9.925).
For her performance last Friday , Dickerson 
earned Southeastern Conference Gymnast of the Week honors. The accolade is her first this season and the third of her Florida career. 
“That (all-around win) was really special for 
Ashanée,” coach Rhonda Faehn said. “She al-ways puts her absolute best into every competi-tion in every event she does.” 
Dickerson’s total was just one-tenth of a 
point off her collegiate-best mark of 39.70, which she earned toward the end of her fresh-man season in the 2010 NCAA North Central Regional.
Her 39.60 is also the second-best all-around score this year, behind Arkansas’ Katherine Grable’s 39.725 against LSU on Jan. 20. 
While Dickerson has recently kept a slightly 
inconspicuous profile, her statistics prove she’s been a powerhouse for the Gators.
Dickerson has averaged a 39.325 as an all-
arounder, which is good for 13th nationally . 
The all-around and floor victories last Friday 
raised her title total to 50 in her three seasons, placing her seventh on UF’s career list.
Dickerson’s performances as an all-around 
competitor have also helped the Gators average a team total of 196.563 throughout four meets. 
With Dickerson leading the way last Friday 
night, UF finished with a 197.775, the fifth-high-est total in school history. That score, which is also the best in the nation this season, helped Florida climb five spots in this week’s GymInfo rankings to No. 3.
“It was amazing to show everyone how 
hard we work in the gym and how much we’ve bonded,” Dickerson said. “It showed in our performance.” 
When No. 3 Florida travels to Tuscaloosa, 
Ala., on Friday night to compete against reign-ing NCAA champion No. 6 Alabama, big pro-duction will now be expected out of Dickerson, although her status as an all-around competitor still remains unknown. 
“She’s becoming more comfortable with 
the actual performance aspect of competing,” Faehn said. “She’s really enjoying what she’s doing out there. You can see it.”Dickerson rounds out first win of the season with SEC honor

When the Florida women’s 
tennis team hosts UCF on 
Wednesday , the expectation will be a clean sweep. 
The No. 1 Gators are simply 
a different class of team. Every match, no matter who is across the court, will be accompanied by an expectation of victory.
Coming off a national cham-
pionship with a team full of proven winners, there is always the possibility of becoming complacent. Florida has not lost since Feb. 21 last year, and vic-tory has seemingly become a way of life. 
However, in this new and 
young season, no one is satis-fied yet.
“There will be a lot of great 
teams this year, a lot of good competition, so I really don’t think (complacency) is an is-sue,” Joanna Mather said.
As one of two seniors, 
Mather could be expected to be the leader and chief motivator. But the team returns all of its key members, and each player has taken it upon herself to con-tinue to get better. 
“(The leadership) is spread 
out,” she said. “This team is re-ally good at knowing what they need to do and making sure they do it. As far as leadership role, if you consider my spot a leadership role, it’s very easy.”
With unranked UCF coming 
to Gainesville Wednesday , the Gators will face their second straight match in which they are overwhelming favorites. More than anything, the dual match will be another chance to improve heading into a chal-lenging match at No. 5 Baylor.
The players maintain that 
they will not overlook any op-ponent, regardless of ranking. 
“I don’t want us to get com-
placent,” sophomore Olivia Janowicz said. “We had a meet-ing the other day , and we don’t want to expect the same things. As long as we’re not complacent and we keep fighting, we want it just as bad or even more.”
Expectations are going to 
be high all season, and rightfully so. The Gators 
have some of the best singles play-ers and dou-bles teams in the nation, a 
top-notch coach, and a national championship to defend. 
The team put together a 
challenging schedule, including the trips to Baylor this weekend and No. 2 Stanford next week-end. This continual challenge is something that will keep Flori-da on its toes. 
When it comes to playing 
teams like UCF, however, the challenge is avoiding letdowns. 
“Every match is another 
match for us,” Mather said. “We’re just going to take it as another step towards our goal at the end of the year.” Complacency no issue 
for hungry Gators
