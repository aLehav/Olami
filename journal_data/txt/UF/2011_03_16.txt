HOUSTON — A potty-mouthed prank-
ster managed to hack into an electronic sign 
in downtown Houston, treating drivers to an earthier message than their used to seeing.
The unknown prankster changed a tem-
porary traffic sign that said “DETOUR” in large orange letters to “POOP .” The message was there for most of the weekend.
Then on Monday morning, the sign was 
changed to “: ) LOL” before workers man-aged to change it back to its standard mes-sage.
The Texas Department of Transportation 
wasn’t amused. Spokeswoman Raquelle Lewis told the Houston Chronicle that hack-ing the onboard computer that controls the sign is disruptive. It’s also punishable by a fine of up to $500.
In 2009, a prankster in Austin got national 
attention by hacking a similar sign to display the message: “Zombies in area! Run!”

After all the votes were tallied and all the 
precincts accounted for, one candidate gets 
to go back to work as a winner, while four 
others have more work to do. 
That one, Commissioner Thomas Hawk-
ins, fended off a stiff challenge for his at-large seat, securing 52.7 percent of the vote 
count, locking up another term on the com-
mission.
In the races for Districts 2 and 3, no 
candidate received the 50 plus one major -
ity required for a nomination, sending the respective races into a run-off round to be held in about four weeks.
In the District 2 race, incumbent Lauren 
Poe will face local businessman and politi-
cal newcomer Todd Chase in a run-off. Poe 
got 35.1 percent of the votes, and Chase re-
ceived 31.4 percent.
In District 3, two 
first-time candidates will square off in a run-off as Susan Bot-
tcher garnered 41.9 percent of votes cast to Rob Zeller’s 30.7 percent. 
In all, 10,979 votes were cast, which ac-
counts for 14.85 percent of registered voters in Gainesville. At the Reitz Union precinct, 57 of the 4,471 registered voters cast ballots.
With numerous supporters in attendance 
at the Alachua County Supervisor of Elec-tions, Hawkins, who defeated former mayor candidate Don Marsh, Richard Selwach and Jeffrey Fiedler, said that the victory will al-
low him to focus more on community issues 
as opposed to running a campaign.
“I just want to get back to work,” Hawk-ins said.“ I want Gainesville to be a commu-nity that provides jobs and opportunities not just for today  but for the future as well.”
Poe said he wasn’t surprised that he was 
pitted in a run-off for his current job.“I didn’t quite know who I would be in a 
run-off against, but I was confident there’d be a run-off,” he said.
Not only was he not surprised, he’s been 
in this position before.When Poe was elected in 2008, he won 
with 52.5 percent in a run-off against Bon-nie Mott.

The Phillips Center for the Per -
forming Arts is expected to be at full 
capacity tonight for a perfomance by 
Matisyahu.
To celebrate Jewish Awareness 
Month, UF Student Government 
Productions teamed up with Ac-cent and the Jewish Student Union to bring the Jewish reggae musician to campus. 
The artist will get $28,000 for his 
act. 
The event will consist of the 
performer’s “insightful words and acoustic music,” said Kyle Calhoun, the SG Productions music and enter -
tainment chairman. 
Matisyahu is known for mixing 
Jewish topics with reggae. His first 
single, “King Without A Crown,” 
ranked No. 28 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 2004. 
Instead of the artist performing 
his usual concert-style show, he will talk to students about recent events such as the tsunami and perform some of his hit songs acoustically.
Rabbi Berl Goldman said this 
performance is perfect timing, con-sidering the Israeli family that was 
murdered Friday night in Palestine. 
He said he cannot wait to hear 
the artist’s positive message about 
caring for others.
He said students called him over 
the weekend worried because they believe Jewish hate crimes will occur throughout the month. 
“Matisyahu’s words bring peace 
to the Jewish community ,” he said. 
Accent’s chairman Zack Gold-
stein said the musician is an Ortho-dox Jew, a denomination which only 10 percent of Jews in the U.S. practice because it follows strict application of laws found in the Torah. 
At 6 p.m., 1,800 free tickets will be 
given out on a first-come-first-serve basis.  The show begins at 8 p.m.Jewish reggae musician Matisyahu brings act to UF
“Matisyahu’s words bring 
peace to the Jewish     
community.”

To get the budget season start-
ed, the Alachua County Com-
mission decided Tuesday to ask County Manager Randall Reid to create a possible budget for 2012.
Commissioners voted 3-2 to 
have the manager create a budget based on how it has been created in the past. They will use this bud-get as a starting point and plan to adjust it as necessary throughout the budget-creating process.
Chairman Lee Pinkoson and 
Commissioner Susan Baird voted 
against the motion.
Pinkoson suggested adjusting 
the Supervisor of Elections Of-
fice and Sheriff’s Office’s budgets in a different way than other of-fices since both will require more money in the next year for the 2012 election and jail services, re-spectively.
Commissioner Rodney Long 
suggested keeping the percent-ages of what each office gets from the overall budget the same. In that scenario, if a department needs more than the allotted per -
centage, then it could argue its 
case to the commis-sion.
While commis-
sioners may not 
agree on the strategy to create the budget, they acknowledge that the 2012 budget will be smaller than previous years.
“The question is, what’s the 
size of the cut?” Commissioner Mike Byerly said.County has initial 
budget discussionUF RESEARCH
By ALLISON BANKO
Alligator Writer
When Dr. Colleen Le Prell recruited 21-year-olds 
who said they had normal hearing for a research 
study , she encountered an oddity . 
Some students who showed up for the study 
didn’t actually have the normal hearing sensitivity 
that they thought they did.  
Le Prell, a UF associate professor in the depart-
ment of speech, language and hearing sciences and 
the study’s lead researcher, then conducted a differ -
ent study measuring students’ hearing losses and 
found that 25 percent of students who believed they had normal hearing actually did not.  
The research focused on 20 males and 37 females 
from UF who averaged around 21 years old and re-ported themselves to have normal hearing. 
The participants completed a health survey and a 
questionnaire about exposure to loud noises includ-
ing sporting events, music players and concerts and loud activities such as using lawn equipment or do-
ing construction.
Male students who listened to personal music 
players were found to have the highest loss.  
Joseph Sparks, a Gainesville audiologist who has 
been practicing since 1980, said college freshmen 60 years ago had better hearing than today’s freshmen. 
“It’s a noisier, louder world,” Sparks said. “We have more exposure to sound because we have more sources of it.”  
Le Prell’s findings concluded that the participants 
had hearing loss on a level not enough to require a 
hearing aid but enough to affect learning. 
“They will have a harder time understanding cer -
tain sounds,” Le Prell said. “In order to get the most information from what the teacher is saying during 
lectures, they’ll have to make adjustments such as moving to the front of the classroom.” 
Kylie Rodriguez, a 22-year-old 
advertising senior, said she has 
trouble with her hearing.
“It wasn’t until the later years 
that I started realizing how often I was asking people to repeat things,” she said.
Rodriguez said she thinks it 
has to do with listening to music.
“I use the headphones that go 
deep into your ears, and I listen to my music on full 
blast,” she said. “Now I can’t listen to anything un-less it’s on full blast.”
Le Prell said that students should take preventa-
tive measures to protect their hearing such as turn-
ing down their music as well as wearing earplugs in 
particularly loud places. 
“The sad reality is once hearing is gone, it doesn’t 
back,” Le Prell said.Students overestimate hearing

NewsLocal  “It’s sort of déjà vu all over 
again,” he said.
  Chase, who spent result 
night at Beef O’ Brady’s, sur-
rounded by family, friends and TVs showing a Gators baseball game, said he feels 
excited about the results.
  “I think that clearly the 
people in District 2 are look-
ing for something different,” he said. “I think my message 
was well-received.”
    James Ingle, who earned 
10.9 percent of the votes in 
District 2, expressed his disap-
pointment but said he thinks 
he ran a good campaign.
  “For a ﬁ  rst time out, I don’t 
think that we were embar-rassed,” he said.
  He said if he had to do it 
over, he would have started campaigning sooner. He thought  the public could use 
a break after the November 
midterm elections, so he be-gan campaigning in January.
  “By then, I think there was 
a head start by the other peo-
ple I was up against,” he said.
  For Bottcher, the run-off 
between her and Zeller rep-
resents a contrast in perspec-
tive on how the city is faring.  
Throughout the campaign, Zeller took many shots at the efﬁ  ciency of city government in the wake of an economic 
downturn. 
  Bottcher, however, views 
the city’s actions from a differ-
ent perspective, choosing to 
highlight progress made.  “I’m a glass-half-full kind 
of person … I think Gainesville 
has come a long way,” she said. 
  In an interview at his post-
election celebration at Gator City, Zeller said the outcome indicates that Gainesville resi-dents are looking for some-
thing new in city government. 
  While he acknowledged 
that he disagreed with the 
city commission on a lot of is-sues, he said if he is elected, 
his business experience would 
help improve the political pro-cess.
  “We disagree on a lot of 
things, but I think we can get some work done,” he said.
  The key to the run-off elec-
tion, candidates from the two races said, will lie in who can 
court the votes of the third-
place candidate who will not move on.
  In District 2, Robert Krames 
earned 22.6 percent of the 
votes, and James Ingle earned 
10.9 percent.
  Chase said he feels conﬁ  -
dent that Krames’ supporters 
will vote for him because they 
have similar viewpoints.
  “I think that the people 
who voted for Robert are go-
ing to be interested in looking 
at my campaign,” Chase said.
  The District 3 race, howev-
er, doesn’t seem so clear cut. UF professor Jimmy Harns-
berger earned 24.4 percent of 
the vote, which is not enough to send him into the next round but enough to make his votes 
pivotal in such a contest.  Just who will get those 
votes is anyone’s guess. Both 
Bottcher and Zeller believe their platforms will be attrac-tive to Harnsberger voters in a 
run-off. 
  Each side has a legitimate 
argument. Both Bottcher and 
Harnsberger are registered 
Democrats, but Harnsberger, 
throughout his campaign, used phrases such as “budget cuts” and “ﬁ  scal responsibil-ity,” things Zeller emphasized 
as well.  4, ALLIGATOR n WEDNESDAY, MARCH 16, 2011

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
UNITED NATIONS — Supporters of a no-
ﬂ  y zone over Libya introduced a U.N. reso-
lution Tuesday aimed at stopping Moammar 
Gadhaﬁ  ’s planes from bombing civilians, 
with France urging quick action but Russia 
and Germany expressing misgivings.
Divisions over a no-ﬂ  y zone that emerged 
among top diplomats from the Group of 
Eight leading economies meeting in Paris 
earlier Tuesday were already spilling into 
negotiations in the 15-member U.N. Secu-rity Council, which includes many G-8 mem-
bers.
Britain’s U.N. Ambassador Mark Lyall 
Grant said council members will discuss the 
proposed resolution “paragraph by para-graph” when they meet again Wednesday morning. Members had “a number of ques-
tions about the text, and everyone agreed 
they would send it back to capitals over-
night,” he said.
Chinese Ambassador Li Baodong said is-
sues to be clariﬁ  ed include whether the ban 
would apply to all ﬂ  ights countrywide. In-
dian Ambassador Hardeep Singh Puri said 
he and other members need to know what countries would contribute the assets for en-
forcing a no-ﬂ  y zone.Lebanon, the Security Council’s only Arab 
member, introduced the no-ﬂ  y provisions of the draft resolution — strongly endorsed by 
the Arab League — to council members at a 
closed meeting Tuesday afternoon. The Ar-
abs are strongly backed by France and Brit-ain, which drafted elements of a no-ﬂ  y reso-
lution last week.
“We are deeply distressed by the fact that 
things are worsening on the ground, that the 
Gadhaﬁ   forces are moving forward extreme-
ly quickly, and that this council has not yet 
reacted,” France’s U.N. Ambassador Gerard 
Araud told reporters as he headed into the 
council meeting. “In the coming days we 
want a resolution ... and we will do our ut-
most to get it.”
France and Britain failed to win support 
for a no-ﬂ  y zone during the two-day meeting 
of G-8 foreign ministers and the group’s ﬁ  nal 
communique did not mention a ﬂ  ight ban. It instead warned of unspeciﬁ  ed “dire conse-
quences” if Gadhaﬁ   did not honor the Liby-
an people’s claim to basic rights, freedom of expression, and representative government.
The halting efforts to raise pressure 
against Gadhaﬁ  ’s 42-year regime came as his forces used tanks, warships and artillery 
Tuesday to gain ground near the rebels’ base 
in eastern Libya.
The G-8 ministers agreed the Security 
Council needs to take more action to pres-
sure Gadhaﬁ   to leave, possibly with new 
sanctions, but not military action.In New York, Lebanon’s U.N. Ambas-
sador Nawaf Salam said the section on the 
no-ﬂ  y zone was drafted in consultation with 
Libya’s U.N. Mission, which backs anti-Gad-
haﬁ   forces. Salam said another section on “the 
strengthening and widening of sanctions” on Libya was introduced by Lyall Grant.
The Arab League called Saturday on the 
U.N. “to shoulder its responsibility ... to im-pose a no-ﬂ  y zone over the movement of Lib-yan military planes and to create safe zones 
in the places vulnerable to airstrikes.”
Salam said Lebanon has asked Libya’s 
U.N. Mission to identify 
speciﬁ  c areas where ci-
vilians would need pro-
tection and safe passage 
corridors.
The Security Council on Feb. 26 imposed 
an arms embargo on Libya and ordered all 
countries to freeze assets and ban travel for Gadhaﬁ   and some close associates. It also 
referred the regime’s deadly crackdown 
on protesters to the International Criminal Court, for an investigation of possible crimes against humanity.
U.N. diplomats said the proposed new 
resolution would call for more muscular en-
forcement of the arms embargo, add names 
of individuals, companies and other entities to the list of those subject to travel bans and asset freezes, and ban commercial ﬂ  ights 
bringing arms or mercenaries into Libya.
The draft resolution would also authorize states to work together to provide humanitar-
ian assistance and take necessary measures 
to protect civilians. It also would establish a 
panel of experts to monitor implementation, 
the diplomats said, speaking on condition of 
anonymity because the text has not been re-leased.
Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov 
said at the G-8 that his country wants more details and clarity from the Arab League about its proposals for Libya before approv-
ing any military intervention.
Amr Moussa, the Arab League’s secre-
tary-general, at the Paris meeting that a no-
ﬂ  y zone would be humanitarian measure to 
protect Libyan civilians and foreigners in the 
country — not a military intervention.
But German Foreign Minister Guido West-
erwelle said his country was “very skeptical” 
about military action. “We do not want to get 
sucked into a war in North Africa,” he said. “We want to avoid any slippery slope in this 
direction.”
Lebanon’s Salam insisted that a no-ﬂ  y 
zone “in no way could qualify as a foreign 
intervention.”
“I would hope that the establishment of a 
no-ﬂ  y zone would have a deterrent effect on 
the Gadhaﬁ   regime, not to ﬂ  y its airplanes to 
attack civilian areas,” he said.
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, 
who on Monday met with her counterparts 
and Sarkozy, traveled to Egypt for talks Tues-
day and did not attend the G-8 meeting.

TALLAHASSEE — Republican-
sponsored legislation setting up a 
merit pay plan for teachers and end-ing tenure for new hires is set for a final vote in the GOP-controlled Florida House on Wednesday — 11 
months after former Gov. Charlie 
Crist vetoed a similar bill.
The new version is designed 
to mirror Florida’s plan for a $700 million federal Race to the Top edu-
cation grant that includes a move 
to merit pay. Opponents, though, say it goes beyond that blue print by chipping away at teachers’ due process and collective bargaining 
rights.
In floor action Wednesday , the 
House rejected four Democratic 
amendments that would have ad-
dressed some of those issues in the Senate-passed bill.
The House sponsor, Rep. Erik 
Fresen, R-Miami, declared them to be “unfriendly” to the bill’s intent.
“The purpose of crafting this 
bill is actually to have an ability to determine what a good teacher is,” Fresen said. “That’s it.”
The legislation would require 
school districts to develop evalu-ation schemes based half on how much improvement each teacher’s 
students have shown on the Florida Com-prehensive Assess-ment Test (FCAT) 
or other exams over a three-year 
period. The other half would be 
based on such factors as evaluations by principals. They could include advanced degrees but only if in a teacher’s subject area.
Those evaluations would be used 
to determine which teachers should get merit pay and which should be let go.
If passed by the House as ex-
pected, the bill would go to Repub-lican Gov. Rick Scott, who has made it one of his top priorities. Crist, a 
Republican-turned-independent, 
vetoed last year’s bill after wide-spread protests by teachers, parents and students as well as objections from many local school officials.
Teachers hired after July 1 would 
never be able to get more than a one-year contract.
The defeated amendments in-
cluded one offered by Rep. Reg-
gie Fullwood, D-Jacksonville, that 
would have required school officials to give terminated teachers written reasons why they didn’t get another annual contract.
“It’s about decency ,” Fullwood 
said. “For your contract not to be re-newed at least tell me why.”
Another failed amendment 
would have allowed highly rated teachers to get three-year contracts. 
Existing teachers would have the 
option of sticking with their present 
salary plan or competing for merit 
pay. State set

People too obsessed with idea of time
Time is a pretty interesting thing. Daylight saving 
time? More like nightlife-losing time. Correct me if I’m wrong, but we can all thank Ben Franklin 
for its invention. 
Among other reasons, it was thought that daylight 
saving time helped people by shifting an hour of day-light in the morning to the evening to help with energy consumption and  to keep an hour of morning sunlight from going by lamented as we curse the sun’s earlier arrival on summer mornings.  
Some college students ought to be particularly fond 
of this reasoning then: I can’t tell you how many stu-
dents I’ve seen that almost entirely block their windows 
with blankets or towels to keep the sunlight out of their room year-round. A lot of them are on such disturbing sleep schedules (here’s a nod to you, architects-in-train-ing) it’s a wonder daylight saving time means anything more than a small creep in deadlines lurching forward by one hour.
Spring forward, fall back. I hope everyone realizes that the notion of even 
saying that one man — even as mythical as Ben is — somehow invented an extra hour is a little silly. It is the construct, the observance, that was put into practice. Certain common observances such as this are often de-creed by governments or made common through reli-gion. Look to Martin Luther King Jr. Day and Christmas for examples. It is interesting that time holds such sway over us that we all willingly accept this somewhat-
whimsical change on our clocks to magically teleport 
the sun around when we choose. The numbers on a face or digital screen are the whistles to our Pavlovian drool-ing, and if the clock says it’s time to wake up, guess what we’re going to do? We hit the snooze button: It is much too early to get out of bed and start hopping around. If only someone could shift our waking hour to a little bit later 
in the day. 
And now we’re back where we started. Everything is 
relative. I think that all of us put too much emphasis on the time of our lives. Yes, as a tool, time is very useful: It helps you plan meetings and meet deadlines. Doesn’t that sound fun? It also helps you coordinate events and share common schedules so we can all see each other’s pretty faces at the same time every day. But do keep in 
mind that those numbers cracking the whip over your 
deadline, be it for an essay, an exam or an opinion piece for a newspaper, though important, are really just sig-nifiers of every present occurrence’s relativity to every-thing else. 
Look at a river: Most people say the river starts as 
a stream in the mountains, becomes the mighty flow 
that passes before them and finally becomes the tribu-
tary meeting the ocean. People liken this to their lives — young in the mountains, old in the ocean. The fact is, all of those instances of the river are happening si-multaneously, all the time. There is no young you and old you: The only reality of your younger years is your memory of them, and the same goes for your prediction of old age. No matter how thin you slice it, your pres-ent, right now, is the only reality. Sun will rise; get used to it. Change your clock; change your thinking. 
Too bad we can’t shift age around like we do daylight 
saving time: In this town, suddenly being teleported to the age of 21 would not go unappreciated.

It’s common knowledge 
that when someone says something like, “No of-
fense, but...” he or she is about to contradict him or herself. After watching a YouTube video making the 
rounds this week, we’re be-
ginning to see those phrases as red flags. We’re talking about the video University of California — Los Angeles 
student Alexandra Wallace 
posted disparaging Asians she saw talking on phones in the school library. 
In an instantly connected 
world, it’s more difficult to consider the plethora of con-sequences that result from posting racist caricatures. 
Once something’s on the In-
ternet, it has a life of its own — especially if the topic is incendiary and the creator 
easily identifiable. Most of 
us understand this concept on at least a visceral level, but let’s take it a step farther. The fallout from this wom-an’s rant did not only affect her and the people she was 
railing against. She was act-
ing as a representative of her university to the people who viewed her video without a 
previous UCLA experience. 
It’s bad enough to wreck her standing in society, but Wallace’s actions reflected poorly upon all American 
college students. After all, 
how could she get accepted into a prestigious school and advance this far in her edu-
cation without considering 
her rant reprehensible?
It boils down to what our 
mothers told us. No, not, “If you don’t have anything nice 
to say, don’t say anything at 
all.” Sometimes you need to call someone out, and talk-ing in the library might be 
one of those cases. We just 
ask that people think before they speak, especially when they’re speaking for others.Excuse us if we seem confused. We’re trying to come to grips with the strange feeling of deja vu. 
It’s not merely that Glenn Beck has once again 
spewed his drivel, it’s his subject and reasoning that sent us reeling. His comments on the Japanese earthquake, which urged people to heed the disaster as a message from God, recall those made by Pat Robertson in the wake of 
the earthquake in Haiti more than a year ago. Beck didn’t 
denounce the Japanese for voodoo or pacts with the devil, of course, but he did advise people to follow the biblical Ten Commandments lest they do something to anger God into taking action.
The two are riffing off the same idea: They’re interpret-
ing natural disasters as divine punishment for areas full of supposed sinners.
Let’s think carefully about this. If a divine being is send-
ing earthquakes and tsunamis to people with track records of sin, what wouldn’t be flooded out? What would we have left? Hold on, Glenn, we need to grab our inner tube to prepare for the deluge. A better message to take from the tragedy is the strength of the human will. Or understand-
ing the helplessness of mankind in the face of something 
so massive and uncontrollable. But that’s a humility lost on people who need to lower their heaven-pointed noses and drop the holier-than-thou attitude in order to feel and 
act like what they are  — human.Noah’s Ark II
Beck’s interpretation 
of disasters is bizarre

Mardi Gras article embarrassing, trashy
First off, I must say I generally don’t read 
the Alligator because, overall, I find its news 
to be pointless and presented in a sophomoric  
manner.
My real complaint is with the article in Mon-
day’s edition entitled “Mardi Gras fails to live up to hype.” 
I was embarrassed to even have an article 
like this in my school newspaper, that only glo-rifies drinking (probably underage as well), wild partying and random hook-up sex. Focusing on nothing but the trashy aspects of Mardi Gras and New Orleans – not saying there are any classy ones – the article was the epitome of the dumbass 
college kid who has only ever “passed” the blunt 
and “graduated” from beer pong to the classier wine pong.
Seriously.The article was trash, and it only made the 
already crappy newspaper trashier. I will only spread negative things about the Alligator until it improves its standards in this area of “news cov-erage.”

UF studentBlock tuition debate not class warfare
The fight against block tuition began admirably 
but has spun out of control thanks to the volition of a few students. When Ben Meyers campaigned on a vote against block tuition he didn’t cast and Dave Schneider on a petition that he didn’t write, 
I was upset but realized it was just politics. How-
ever, on my first day back from break, I was greet-ed by signs and graffiti stating that, “The block might spare you if you have a trust fund,” and that the fight is some kind of class warfare. 
This is ridiculous. Statements like these conflate 
those among us who are fortunate to have college paid for with an administration that is ignoring the voice of its students, and they only serve to 
alienate a large population of the campus who 
are still affected by the change and are opposed to it. In a parting note, no one group has been more instrumental in stopping block tuition than the UF Students United Against Block Tuition, who originally discovered the proposed change and brought it to light via the petition many have signed. These are some upstanding students who you won’t see using their work against block tu-
ition to further their own political careers.

Why would a country that 
calls itself a world super -
power willingly place it-
self at the mercy of foreign govern-ments? Especially when that same 
government has the capabilities to 
lessen its dependence of foreign en-tities and strengthen its economy?
The revolutions occurring in the 
Middle East are threatening Amer -
ica’s already weakened economy . Egypt fell, Libya is next and it’s only a matter of time until surrounding countries follow the same pattern.
The instability threatens our abil-
ity to receive the resource so critical to our lives — oil.
Because of the uprisings, oil com-
panies in the Middle East are pro-ducing at a significantly lower rate. Less supply means higher prices.
Experts are predicting $5 per 
gallon gas prices. These prices will 
cripple us and an economy that is 
just getting back on its feet.
If we rely on shaky countries to 
supply us with our oil, America will have no choice but to enter into an-other war we can not afford.
We have a stable government. If we began p r o d u c i n g our own sup-ply of oil, we 
would no longer have the possibility 
of our economy being affected be-
cause of politics in the Middle East.
I think that alternative forms of 
energy like solar and natural gas can benefit our society , but realistically , there is no way we will be free from oil.  We need it, and America has it.
There is a massive oil deposit 
that covers North Dakota and por -
tions of South Dakota and Montana.  This oil isn’t the traditional crude oil we are used to. It is shale oil, but can be processed into lower-grade oil suited for cars.
This process is laborious and ex-
pensive, but I would rather spend the money here to produce the oil than send money overseas.
America sends hundreds of bil-
lions of dollars overseas every year because of oil.  Imagine how stable our economy could become if we drilled here.

A day after cracking the top 10 
for the first time in team history, 
the No. 10 Gators played like they deserved it with an 18-6 win over visiting Colgate.
Florida (7-1) used the hot stick 
of Brittany Dashiell to come alive following a stagnant opening 10 
minutes Tuesday. After falling 
behind the Raiders 1-0, Dashiell scored three of the Gators’ first six goals and also contributed a first-half assist.  
“This was probably one of 
Brittany’s best games she’s ever played as a Florida Gator,” coach Amanda O’Leary said. 
Dashiell was complemented 
by fellow midfielder Janine Hilli-er, who dominated in open space, weaving through traffic and past Colgate (3-4) defenders. 
“Toward the second half of 
the game, they started pressur -
ing us more,” Dashiell said. “We just moved the ball quickly so 
they would be running more and 
we could tire them out and then drive to goal.” 
The Gators extended their 
four-goal halftime lead with a 10-1 run to start the second pe-riod, culminating with Dashiell’s career-high fifth goal while Hilli-
er chipped in three of her own. 
O’Leary said her midfielders were effective against the Raid-ers because they were quicker 
and able to get in one-one-one situations. 
“It helps to have a team with a 
little bit of speed,” O’Leary said. “You have Haydon [Judge] who 
can run, and Jamie [Reeg] who 
has a great stick and Janine just has the combination of both.”
After working hard to get the 
ball up the field in transition, Hill-ier was relieved to see Florida’s attackers, Kitty Cullen and Ash-ley Bruns, finish what she and the midfielders started. Cullen and 
Bruns combined for seven goals 
on thirteen shots, allowing those who started the break to rest after sprinting 40-plus yards.
“Brittany and Janine are our 
middies, they run up and down the field the whole game, playing offense and defense,” O’Leary said. “They are just the big-time 
glue players for us, holding us 
together.”
With six minutes left, the 
Gators were able to clear the bench for the second straight game, something O’Leary and Hillier were pleased to see before Florida plays No. 11 Syracuse and then starts conference games 
a week later.
“We’re just moving forward 
and taking it day by day, but we 
wouldn’t be as far as we are right now without those practice play-ers who just go hard at practice, so everyone’s accountable,” Hill-ier said.8, ALLIGATOR n WEDNESDAY, MARCH 16, 2011

Dashiell, Hillier dominate midfield in Gators rout
By STEPHEN SHEEHAN
Alligator Writer 
When it comes to offense, UF coach Tim 
Walton lives by the motto, “If it ain’t broke, 
don’t fix it.” 
When the No. 2 Gators (25-1, 2-0 SEC) 
are outscoring opponents 221-25, some-
thing is going right. 
Led by the powerful quartet of Aja Pac-
ulba, Kelsey Bruder, Brittany Schutte and 
Megan Bush, the Gators have pounded op-ponents with the long ball. 
While the rest of the lineup has had its 
ups and downs, those four have combined for 34 of the team’s 49 home runs. 
Bruder, who ranks fifth on the team with 
a .351 average, has hit six homers out of the No. 3 spot in the lineup. 
Although many of her hard-hit balls 
have been right at fielders, she remains a key cog in the middle of the order. 
“It’s our job as the heart of the lineup 
to produce almost all of the runs,” Bruder said. “We’ve produced sac flies or a single 
here and there, and we’ve also gotten the 
big hit when we need to.”
In addition to the consistent Bruder and 
Paculba, the one player whose reputation is quickly growing is Schutte. “Schutte is feared by other teams,” Wal-
ton said. “Coaches approach me after the 
game and say, ‘She’s such a tough out.’ She 
can turn it around in a heartbeat with one 
swing of the bat.” 
Expectations were high for 
the sophomore after she set five UF freshman hitting re-cords with a .346 average, 19 homers and 59 RBIs last year. 
The cleanup hitter has not disappointed 
in year two, as she ranks second on UF with nine home runs and has also drawn a team-high 23 walks. 
After she exploded on to the scene last year, opponents have adjusted. Schutte has had to do the same. 
“It’s more difficult this year because 
they know me better, so I’m limited on the pitches I get,” she said. “They’re definitely trying to get strikes that are off the plate.”
But with No. 5 hitter Megan Bush lead-
ing the team with 11 homers and 38 RBIs, opposing pitchers can hardly afford to pitch around Schutte.
“When you’re in the 3-, 4-, 5-spot, teams 
label you as the big hitters and want to be more careful,” Bruder said. “We feed off each other. When Brittany’s hitting good, they won’t pitch to her, so they try to pitch 
to me. There are really no gaps in our line-
up.”Florida’s powerful offense keyed by four star players
UF has scored 221 runs through 26 games this season

ONLINE BRACKET CHALLENGE BASKETBALL PRACTICE OPEN INSIDEn FLORIDA HELD ITS ANNU-
AL PRO DAY IN THE SWAMP ON TUESDAY.
By GREG LUCA
Alligator Staff Writer
gluca@alligator.org
While NFL players and owners 
struggle to reach a new collective 
bargaining agreement, a number of departing Gators continue to pre-pare for a future that may be put 
on hold. 
As Florida held its annual Pro 
Day in Ben Hill Griffin Stadium on 
Tuesday, the participating players understood the career they’re train-ing for may not be available to them next year. 
“It’s bad timing, man,” senior 
center Mike Pouncey said. “You 
want to fulfill all of your dreams, 
and playing in the NFL is one of my biggest dreams.”
Perhaps none of UF’s NFL Draft 
hopefuls will be as deeply affected by the lockout as junior safety Will Hill, who chose to leave school ear -
ly despite the uncertainty.
Hill cited the need to provide for 
his wife and three children as the primary reason he declared, but the NFL owners’ recent decision to lock out the players would prevent him from signing a contract and profit-ing from his jump to the pros. 
Although he suggested he could 
get a job, finish his anthropology degree or continue training in Boca Raton, Hill is hopeful the labor situ-ation will be resolved before next 
season if there is a work stoppage.
“I don’t think this country will 
let it go without football, because 
basically everybody loves football,” Hill said. “They will come to an agreement, and eventually they will have a season. And then it’s time to play ball.”
Many of Hill’s teammates shared 
his optimism but formed contin-gency plans all the same. 
Senior offensive lineman Mar -
cus Gilbert said he would contact some of the veterans from which-ever team selects him to prepare for the eventual jump, while Pouncey and senior safety Ahmad Black said they would continue workouts in 
Gainesville. 
Duke Lemmens, a senior defen-
sive end with one semester left until 
he graduates with a degree in event management, said he would even consider planning a few weddings. 
“Easter theme, I could wear my 
light green pimp suit,” Lemmens 
said. “We’ll see.”
Players like Lemmens, who 
could potentially go undrafted, are 
even more harshly affected than the

Labor dispute creates uncertain NFL futures for Gators
UF’s win important for many reasons
The Gators received mountains of 
hype and accolades before they even played an inning this season.
Fifteen games into its schedule, No. 1 
Florida had yet to prove it is deserving of the attention. 
But on Tuesday, the Gators showed why 
they were atop the rankings.
Thanks to a pretty soft schedule to start 
the season, UF’s record looked like that of a No. 1 team. 
However, midweek losses to FSU and 
Georgia Southern indicated otherwise.
On, Tuesday, though, Florida finally 
broke through. 
And, who knew, all it took was one 
swing from Daniel Pigott.
With the win, the Gators ended the Sem-
inoles’ four-game winning streak in the rivalry and extinguished any doubts that would have come along with three mid-week losses to start the season. 
The importance of the victory didn’t go 
unnoticed by coach Kevin O’Sullivan.
“Personally, I’m worn out,” he said. “I don’t quite remember ever being involved in a game like that. 
There was so many 
pitching changes. I think there were 15 pitchers who touched 
the mound tonight for 
both teams. They used their bench. We used our bench. Kind of a 
back-and-forth game.”
That it was, but that’s what Florida 
needed.
Before the victory, the Gators had been 
winning by a margin of more than five runs per game. 
Florida had not yet been forced to ex-
ecute a comeback or come through at the plate during the late innings.
For a while it looked like UF would 
flounder as it left 13 runners on base, but 
surprising standout Daniel Pigott came

Despite a familiar foe once again 
plaguing Florida in its most recent 
matchup versus Florida State, the top-
ranked Gators outlasted the No. 4 Sem-
inoles 5-4 in a dramatic walk-off win in extra innings Tuesday night in front of a record crowd of 5,930 at McKethan 
Stadium.
In a wacky game that included over-
managing, questionable umpiring and 
a plethora of pitching changes, No. 1 UF 
ended its nemesis’ recent dominance 
with a comeback victory propelled by 
the hot-hitting Daniel Pigott. The Gators (15-2) squandered mul-
tiple opportunities, leaving 13 men on base, but the junior went 3 for 4 with 
four RBIs, plating the tying and game-
winning runs, including the 10th-in-
ning single that scored 
Nolan Fontana. 
“Daniel has been 
our hottest hitter 
so far, and he came 
through in the clutch again,” coach Kevin 
O’Sullivan said. 
“It’s one we couldn’t let slip away . 
We had all these opportunities that 
at some point you’ve got to cash in Pigott’s walk-off hit

Similar to its recent previous losses against 
FSU (15-2), Florida was in an early hole thanks 
to a poor start by Alex Panteliodis. 
The lefty fought constant pressure during 
his brief outing, failing to get out the leadoff 
hitter in every inning. Panteliodis tossed a 
26-pitch first inning but escaped a bases-load-ed jam with deep flyout to center field. 
However, in the third inning, Florida State 
put up a four spot with a couple of bombs. 
Following a two-run shot to right and 
opposite-field double to left, Panteliodis was 
pulled after just 2.1 innings, allowing three 
runs on five hits. 
Greg Larson entered and struck out the 
first batter he faced before FSU’s Justin Gonza-lez crushed a two-run homer over the left-field bleachers. 
But the game turned after Larson settled 
down. Despite giving up the bomb to Gonza-lez, Larson pitched well in relief, throwing 3.2 
innings and retiring the last eight batters in a 
row.
“The key to it was Larson settling things 
down,” O’Sullivan said. “After the two-run homer, he put three zeros on the board.”
The Gators chipped away with runs in the 
third and fourth, but they continually wasted valuable chances, struggled with breaking 
balls and off-speed pitches and consistently swung out in front of changeups and curve-
balls. 
UF threatened in the fifth, but FSU right 
fielder James Ramsey , who also hit one of the 
two homers in the third, made a diving catch 
to save extra bases and end the scoring oppor -
tunity .  
In the seventh, Mike Zunino hit a come-
backer to the Seminoles sidearmer Daniel Ben-nett, stranding three runners on base.
“You could feel the frustration in the dug-
out,” O’Sullivan said. 
The game got testy in the eighth when 
O’Sullivan contested vehemently to the um-pire’s inconsistent strike zone. One batter lat-
er, Nick Maronde drilled FSU’s Stuart Tapley, 
who objected, nearly causing a brawl. UF as-sistant coach Brad Weitzel was ejected, then somehow was allowed to stay in the game. 
But the Gators escaped further damage 
and captured the momentum when Preston Tucker gunned out a runner at the plate. 
In the bottom half of the frame, Pigott 
smashed a single into center, tying the game and sending the raucous crowd into a frenzy . 
Two innings and a combined 15 pitch-
ers later, Pigott won the game for the Gators 
with a knock off the Seminoles’ hard-throwing 
closer.
“I knew [McGee] was going to give me a 
hard time up there, but you just have to go up there with your best mindset, knowing you’re better than the other guy and you’re going to win,” Pigott said.
Etc.: Following the game, O’Sullivan com-
mented on Bryson Smith’s suspension after being charged with a DUI, saying, “We texted back and forth a little bit yesterday. I didn’t have a chance to meet with him yet. I’m go-
ing to meet with him tomorrow. We needed 
to focus on this game first, then we’ll deal with it.”WEDNESDAY, MARCH 16, 2011 n ALLIGATOR, 15
Larson creates opportunity for comeback with strong relief outing
BASEBALL , from page 14through, like he has much of the sea-
son, with game-tying and game-win-ning hits.
“For me it was (a sense of relief),” 
O’Sullivan said. “It’s a rival game and one that we can’t let slip away. 
You got all of these opportunities and we left, I think, 13 guys stranded. 
At some point, you’ve got to cash in against good teams.”
A loss to the Seminoles would have 
sent the Gators into their Southeast-
ern Conference schedule reeling — a 
place they don’t want to be in head-ing into Baton Rouge, La., to play No. 8 LSU this weekend.
But it’s funny how sports work.Take away Pigott’s effort and the 
Gators lose a fifth consecutive game to the Seminoles. Florida would have likely lost its 
No.1 ranking and doubt would have filled the minds of most of the play-
ers.
However, just one hit from Pigott 
changed all of that. All of a sudden, 
things are looking up heading into conference play.
“I think [the win] helps a lot, to be 
quite honest with you,” O’Sullivan said. “I don’t know if it’s going to have any outcome on how we play 
this weekend, but I know going into 
it I feel a lot better. 
“You get beat by your rival four 
games in a row, you start feeling like you got to get one, start breaking a 
trend. I thought this was a big win for 
us, a really big win.”
Momentum is always swinging 
back and forth, but the Gators have it 
on their side now. 
They can thank Pigott for that.ANTHONY , from page 14

Undrafted players cannot speak to teams 
or sign free-agent contracts until a new col-
lective bargaining agreement is in place. This leaves them in limbo, unsure whether 
they should hold out hope for the NFL or 
move on with their lives. 
“It’s unfortunate,” Lemmens said. “May-
be I’ll sneak into a late round and not have to worry about it. If I have to be a free agent, I’ll just keep waiting for a phone call.”Each Gator’s fate hinges on the ability 
of the NFL owners and players to reach an accord as to how the league’s revenue — which totaled $9 billion last season — will be split.
“I’m sure (the owners) will take a little 
bit of a pay cut,” Black said. “At the end of the day, they own the team, but I don’t think they played a down. I’m sure kids don’t go 
to the store and say, ‘I want the owner’s jer -
sey.’
“I’m not going to take shots at the owners

Following Florida coach Will 
Muschamp at the podium Monday 
afternoon, Charlie Weis appeared to have all the intensity of a Sunday drive.
Weis cracked self-deprecating 
jokes, gave a reporter a pop quiz and made light of past missteps in his first press conference as the Gators’ offensive coordinator. He even re-ferred to Tom Brady as “Tommy ,” explaining that is what friends call the three-time Super Bowl cham-pion quarterback.
Perhaps the most intriguing as-
pect of UF’s coaching change as the team begins spring practice today is the transition to a pro-style offense. But after one year running the Kan-sas City Chiefs’ offense and five as the highly scrutinized head coach at Notre Dame, the pressure is off Weis in his new role. 
“This is Coach Muschamp’s of-
fense, not Charlie Weis’ offense. This is the University of Florida, this is not Charlie Weis’ offense,” Weis said. “I’m just trying to get us back to winning on a regular basis, and I think we all want the same thing.”
Making the move back to the col-
lege game wasn’t a difficult decision 
for Weis, who was primarily moti-
vated by his family . He left Kansas City for Gainesville to suit his wife, Maura; daughter, Hannah; and son, Charlie Jr.
His son will be a freshman at 
UF this fall and hopes to pursue a coaching career, which will begin as a student assistant for the Gators.  
Maura is what Weis called “a horse 
person,” so the family will fittingly buy a home in Ocala. 
But Hannah, a 15-year-old with 
special needs, may have had the biggest influence in Weis’ decision after a rocky adjustment to Kansas City.
“I had decided during this foot-
ball season that we had to bring Hannah back to South Bend some-time late spring to get her back into 
her normal comfort zone,” Weis 
said. “She had a really rough year. Sometimes when you move, you forget about things that are really important in life.
“The fact that I can take care of 
my wife and my daughter and my son and kind of mesh everything together, it’s really as simple an an-swer as that one.”
Although there were plenty of 
personal benefits in accepting Mus-champ’s offer, the Gators will likely reap the greatest rewards from the move. 
The four-time Super Bowl cham-
pion brings a lengthy resume, a great deal of offensive expertise and an impressive presence on the re-cruiting trail — all of which Florida greatly needs after a disappointing 2010 season.
“Part of buying in is instant 
credibility , and he brings instant credibility as a football coach be-cause of what he’s accomplished,” Muschamp said. “Our players un-derstand what he’s talking about is good and it works, and it’s worked before, and it will work again, and it 
will work for us this year.”
Weis said he plans to use the 
spring practice season as a chance 
to mentally and physically chal-lenge the Gators to see if they can handle the new offensive scheme, but he knows he is inheriting a ros-ter full of players recruited to run the spread.  UF’s offense will involve more 
under-center, pro-style packages, but Weis said his philosophy is equally predicated on formations and personnel.
“It all depends on what you have 
and who you have. That’s what you do, and that’s yet to be deter -
mined,” Weis said. “I have not seen these guys put a football in their hands yet.
“But I can tell you this: We’ve 
got a bunch of guys that can run. I’ve seen that in the time I’ve been here. I think [Jeff Demps’] 6.53 60 
meters, I might be able to figure out 
something to do with him.”
Weis also thinks he can make 
use of quarterback John Brantley , a more natural fit for  Weis’ offense than Urban Meyer’s. Brantley isn’t guaranteed a starting spot, Weis said, but he has the experience and ability to thrive in the Gators’ new 
system.
“He’s not super athletic, but 
then, Tommy Brady was not super 
athletic,” Weis said. “I’m not com-paring John Brantley to Tommy Brady , but just because somebody says you’re not super athletic does not mean you can’t be a front-line quarterback.”
Weis recruited Brantley while 
he was at Notre Dame and admit-ted to already taking a few “Jer -
sey swipes” at the quarterback for choosing a spread-option system in the first place. 
But Weis spoke more glowingly 
about Florida’s program and his-tory — particularly as it related to 
his long journey to Gainesville.
“When you get beat on the re-
cruiting trails a whole bunch of 
times, which I did, and [Meyer] ends up winning two National Champi-onships and I get fired, I think may-be I came to the right place,” Weis said. “That’s pretty simple. No one ever said I was stupid.”16, ALLIGATOR n WEDNESDAY, MARCH 16, 2011
