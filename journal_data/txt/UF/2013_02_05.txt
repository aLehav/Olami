Two local organizations teamed 
up Monday to spread awareness 
about an often unspoken issue throughout UF.
Fight Injustice and Global Hu-
man Trafﬁ  cking and Gators for Free the Slaves hosted “A Picture of Free-dom,” an interactive demonstration about the meaning of freedom, on the Plaza of the Americas.The demonstration, which last-
ed from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., kicked off Justice Week 2013, a six-day se-ries of events to raise awareness in Gainesville about human trafﬁ  ck-ing, which is the illegal practice of modern slavery, said Jessy John, vice president of FIGHT.
The two organizations ﬁ  rst host-
ed Justice Week together in January 2012. 
Participants were asked to write 
what freedom meant to them on a small chalkboard before having their pictures taken with the message.
Jordan Shannon, a 20-year-old 
UF history senior, wrote “the right to free will” for his photo. Shannon said he was glad to participate in the event.
“I learned a lot that I didn’t 
know,” he said. “They are very pas-sionate, and they’re doing their best to spread awareness.”Junior Alaina

gymnastics team have

“Some engineers can go to 
Wall Street and become invest-ment bankers,” said the UF com-puter engineering junior. “The opportunities that are open to me are so vast.”Engineers had the highest 
starting salaries, making $61,913, according to the National Associ-ation of Colleges and Employers survey for 2012 college graduates starting salaries. 
Computer science graduates 
were the next highest, followed by business and health science alumni.
Paul Rocha, an undergraduate 
academic adviser for computer engineering students, said a re-bounding economy has raised the demand for computer engineers.
From mobile banking to apps 
that let consumers check weekly supermarket ads, computer engi-neers are getting a leg up in the technology industry.
Last semester, UF computer 
engineering seniors received about two job offers each, Rocha said.
Humanities and social sciences 
earn an average salary of $36,988, according to the survey.Stephanie Smith, a UF under-
graduate coordinator and associ-ate chair for the English depart-ment, said an engineering degree doesn’t equal a successful job.
English majors are increas-
ingly being hired to translate the jargon prose of engineers into simpler terms, Smith said.
“You can’t do any of the STEMs without being able to think and speak clearly,” she said. “Ev-ery big corporation has internal modes of communications that have to be accessible.”
Daniella Alonso, an 18-year-
old UF exploratory freshman, plans on using her visual arts and sciences electives to enhance her future career as a psychiatrist.
“Once you have art, it’s a 
tool,” Alonso said. “Everything coming out through your draw-ing is subconscious, whether you know it or not.”

�STUDENT SENATE WILL 
HEAR A RESOLUTION ABOUT THE CAMPAIGN ON FEB. 12.

A student government 
agency launched a campaign 
Monday to extend Student Nighttime Auxiliary Patrol service to areas north of cam-pus.
The “One More Block” 
campaign, led by Nightlife Navigators, aims to extend SNAP rides to one block north of West University Avenue.
Cristian Arango, a 20-year-
old history and political sci-ence junior and director of Nightlife Navigators, said the campaign’s goal is to make walking safer in areas north of campus.
“It has been an issue for 
awhile,” he said. “We don’t want innocent women who are students to get assaulted. We do not want to hear about tragedies.”
On Feb. 12, Student Senate 
will hear a resolution in sup-port of the campaign.
If approved by UF admin-
istrators, St. Augustine Cath-olic Church, Emerson Hall, Classroom Building 105, UF Hillel, and three fraternity houses: Pi Kappa Alpha, Delta Tau Delta and Delta Upsilon, will be designated pickup areas.
Bob Miller, UF associate 
vice president of business affairs and economic devel-opment, said he was open to discussing the extension with student leaders. 
However, he said he had 
some concerns, including the issue of SNAP vans navigat-ing off campus.  
“That’s outside of the nor-
mal SNAP operations area,” he said. “And the locations that they have identiﬁ  ed are just across the street from where we do provide ser-vice.”
Arango said the agency 
will continue to publicize the campaign. He said he hopes the extension will become a discussed topic during the Student Government elec-tions on Feb. 19 and Feb. 20.SNAP campaign aims

The Oscar Mayer Wienermo-
bile will be on UF’s campus today  
looking for the 26th class of Hot-doggers.
Hotdoggers are the Wiener-
mobile drivers, who also handle media pitching, media negotia-tions and vehicle maintenance, said current Hotdogger Holly Nelson.
Nelson, who also goes by the 
moniker Hot Diggity Holly, is a 2012 University of Minnesota Duluth graduate. The 23-year-old will be spreading information about the open positions with Lisa Rosenblum, also known as Lots of Ketchup Lisa. Rosenblum, 23, is a Hotdogger who graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in May 2012.
The Wienermobile doesn’t 
have plans for when and where it will be on campus the next few days. But the Hotdoggers will be visiting classes and clubs on those days.
Oscar Mayer is looking for re-
cent college graduates who are interested in the fields of market-ing and communication to fill the spots of those leaving the pro-gram in June.
The Hotdogger position is a 
one-year contract, Nelson said.“If you have a love for trav-
eling, that is definitely a plus,” Rosenblum said.
Oscar Mayer usually looks for 
candidates who graduated be-tween one and two years ago.
“Recent doesn’t necessar-
ily mean right after graduation,” Rosenblum said.
Twelve Hotdoggers will be se-
lected out of about 1,500 who ap-ply to travel across the country to one of the six assigned regions in a two-member Hotdogger team.
An information session for 
those interested in the position will be held on Feb. 12 at 5:30 p.m. in the Career Resource Cen-ter conference room.

The future is bright for the UF 
Solar Gators — if it can pay its 
power bill.
The Solar Gators started in 
Fall 2011 with the goal of design-ing and building a solar-powered car to race this summer. Now, with the start of the Spring se-mester, the team faces a problem: The time to fundraise is running out.
The team aims to compete in 
the 2013 Formula Sun Grand Prix in Texas, one of the most presti-gious solar car competitions in the nation.
The team’s fundraising goal is 
$60,000, which includes building and designing the car and travel expenses.
“Funding-wise, we’re about a 
quarter of the way there,” said Ja-son Rosen, a 20-year-old UF ma-terials science and engineering junior and team captain. “At the same time, we’re getting ready to order parts.”
The competition will feature 
teams from different universities from across the country.
The winners of the race don’t 
receive prize money, but some-thing even more valuable: brag-ging rights and more sponsors, said Joseph Herrera, a 24-year-old UF fifth-year mechanical engineering student and head of the team’s mechanical engineer -
ing department.The Solar Gators are in the 
process of deciding how to order  parts in a timely manner with the funding it already has. Some parts must be specially made and can take up to four months to be built.
Kanaga Ragav , a 24-year-old 
UF second-year electrical engi-neering master’s student and head of the team’s electrical engi-neering department, said his sec-tion takes up most of the team’s budget, and picking parts for the car requires delicate planning.
“We have to choose parts we 
can test individually throughout the whole system,” he said. “So we have to select those compo-nents and then accordingly look at the budget elsewher.”
Rosen said the team currently 
has three sponsors to help fund the project. One of the sponsors includes Solar Impact, a local so-lar energy installation company.
Barry Jacobson, president of 
Solar Impact, said he was en-thusiastic to support the Solar Gators.
“My wife and I were both un-
dergrad and grad students at UF, and these type of projects really were what made our time there,” he said. “This was the perfect opportunity to contribute to the community.”
So far, the team has compiled 
a list of 200 potential local com-panies.
“At this point, out of sheer 
desperation, we’re going to be cold calling,” he said. “We’re go-ing to get 99 nos for every yes — but every yes counts.”Solar Gators need

Students walking on Turlington Plaza 
and to the Reitz Union can express their 
ideas for changes on campus to help mold the Swamp Party’s platform.
Swamp Party representatives donning 
the party’s T-shirts invited students to write on whiteboards Monday . They will also be out today from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. to collect ideas for the party’s platform.Among the suggestions scribbled in 
Sharpie markers were calls for more park-ing, more blue emergency lights and an effort to bring back UF’s mobile app.
Sen. Jamie Lowstetter said her favorite 
suggestion was for gender-neutral hous-ing and bathrooms.
“It’s not like we’re going to people try-
ing to campaign,” she said. “We’re just getting ideas.”
Swamp Party spokesman Elliot Grasso 
said the party will announce its official platform a week before the election.
Exploratory social and behavorial 
freshman Savannah Prose, 19, wrote she would like to see more outlets in the resi-dence halls. She said she only has one out-let on her side of her room, and she has to plug in multiple extension cords, which can be a fire hazard.
“It helps them understand what the 
Student Body needs and wants to see changed,” Prose said.
Students Party spokesman Michael 
Christ said his party has been meeting with groups across campus to gather ideas for their platform. He said members will set up tables on Turlington Plaza and the Reitz Union Colonnade this week to talk to students. The Students Party plans to unveil its platform next week.

To see if students are getting 
good deals, the Consumer Financial 
Protection Bureau is reviewing the impact of products marketed to stu-dents through their university.
These financial products include 
student identification cards that double as credit cards, cards used to access scholarships and student loans, and school-affiliated bank ac-counts.“With student debt topping $1 
trillion, student loans are no longer the exception, they are the norm,” said Rohit Chopra, student loan mediator at the bureau. “If students are hit with unexpected fees from products that they thought were go-ing to be free, that will make it even tougher to pay back large student loan debt.”
The Credit CARD Act of 2009 
made agreements between colleges and credit card issuers subject to public disclosure, but less is known about arrangements concerning oth-er products marketed to students. 
To get a better idea if these other 
financial products are in the best in-terest of students, the bureau is ask-ing students, families and on-cam-pus financial institutions to submit comments about their experiences.
“We want to get an understand-
ing of how schools go about making these agreements,” Chopra said.
The bureau is looking for input 
on what information schools share with financial institutions, how cam-pus financial products are marketed to students, what fees students are being charged when using these products and how schools set up marketing agreements. Comments can be submitted until March 18.
Chopra said it was too soon to 
tell what would happen if the bu-reau found students are not getting good deals from college-endorsed banking products.
It’s important for students to 
know they have other options, Chopra said.
Ian Hoek Spaans, an 18-year-old 
UF mechanical engineering fresh-man, said when he came to UF, his parents felt like he had to switch banks to Wells Fargo.
Hoek Spaans said the Wells Far -
go on campus has been convenient, but he isn’t thrilled about the added fees like having to pay for checks.
Wells Fargo spokeswoman 
Richele Messick said the company has had a campus card relationship with UF since 1995. Messick said Wells Fargo is interested in having students as customers because they want to build lifelong relationships.
“It’s about the student choice and 
decision on whether if they think it’s a worthwhile option,” she said.

A crash at Northeast Waldo Road and East University Av-
enue on Monday morning left a Newberry man dead and traffic 
backed up for more than four hours.
Tyler Clayton Gaultney, 31, collided with a semi-truck after 
he drove through a red light in his Ford Taurus at about 5:30 a.m., said GPD spokesman Officer Ben Tobias. Gaultney was traveling west on East University Avenue in the outside lane while Larry Windle, 68, drove north on Northeast Waldo Road in a semi-truck with an empty log trailer, Tobias said.At the intersection, Gaultney ran the red light. Windle 
couldn’t stop his truck in time and crashed into the side of Gault-ney’s car, Tobias said.
Although Gaultney’s airbags went off, he didn’t wear a seat-
belt, Tobias said, and was thrown out of the car. Officers pro-nounced Gaultney dead at the scene. Meanwhile, an ambulance took Windle to Shands at UF to treat him for potential injuries.
For the next four hours, police closed the intersection to in-
vestigate the crash, Tobias said.
At about 9:30 a.m., police reopened the intersection and traf-
fic returned to normal.

A Gainesville nonprofit organization will be-
gin offering free citizenship classes Thursday.
Volunteers from the Latina Women’s League 
will help prepare participants for the U.S. citizen-
ship test and hold mock interviews at the Millhop-per Branch Library, located at 3145 NW 43rd St.
The classes will run each Thursday from 6 p.m. 
to 7:30 p.m. until March 28.
The classes, which are held twice a year, are 
available for people of all cultural backgrounds, said Victoria Condor-Williams, president of the Latina Women’s League.
“It’s important to give this particular tool ... for 
people who are applying,” she said.
The classes will also provide attendees with a 
chance to meet with a lawyer and learn lessons geared toward different portions of the citizen-ship test, said Greg Mullaley, an instructor for the citizenship classes.
In order to take the official citizenship test, ap-
plicants need to submit a N-400 to U.S. Citizen-ship Immigration and Services as well as two pho-tographs, a copy of their permanent resident card and a check to pay for the application and finger -
printing, according to the department’s website.
Once the application processes, applicants will 
take a citizenship and English test.
There are a total of 100 questions that appli-
cants need to know, Mullaley said. Out of this grouping, 10 questions will be asked, and only six correct answers are needed to pass.
Mullaley said six out of the eight classes will 
be dedicated to the different sections of the test, which range from American history to integrated civics.
Jonathan Scholl, an instructor for this year’s 
classes, said the instructors will help tutor stu-dents in specific sections of the test.
“What we will be doing this year is tailoring 
[the classes] to the needs of people who come,” he said.    
During the years the league has held the class-
es, Condor-Williams said the students ranged from 25 to 75 years old and come from a wide range of cultural backgrounds. Last semester, the class size was about 10 to 12 people, she said.            
Dzenan Elkaz, a Shands Jacksonville pediatric 
cardiology nurse, received his citizenship in 2001 after he immigrated to the U.S. from Bosnia five years earlier.

Florida ranks third for human trafficking
The pictures will be uploaded to the 
Justice Week 2013 Facebook page, where 
participants can tag themselves and share their photos with friends, John said.
Christopher Barton, a 21-year-old 
UF political science and criminology se-nior and president of Gators for Free the Slaves, said human trafficking is a big problem today.“The fact is that slaves are more avail-
able, more numerous, and cheaper than they’ve ever been, despite the fact that it’s illegal everywhere,” he said. “It violates the dignity of every human being.”
Many people, Barton added, don’t re-
alize human trafficking is a serious issue in the United States.
Florida ranks third in the country for 
human trafficking, behind California and Texas, according the National Human Trafficking Resource Center.
“It’s an important issue because it’s an 
invisible issue,” he said.
John said she thinks people nation-
wide don’t fully understand the horrors victims of human trafficking face.
“Imagine if it was your sister, your 
cousin, your friend,” she said. “We shouldn’t be indifferent because they’re strangers.”

As UF continues to expand, the older 
parts of campus have to keep up with the 
times.
Rolfs Hall, completed in 1927, is part of 
UF’s historic district. The hall’s stair tower, located behind Turlington Hall, is currently being repaired. 
The stair tower, unlike the rest of the 
building, was built in the late 1970s.
Joe Garcia, project manager of the Archi-
tecture and Engineering Department of the Physical Plant Division, said only the exte-rior bricks of the tower are being replaced. All the existing bricks will be removed and replaced.
“People can use the stair tower,” he said. 
“What we’re repairing has no effect on the structural integrity of the stair tower.”
Garcia said the repair job is expected to 
cost $140,000. The repairs could take up to six weeks. 
Harold Barrand, associate director of the Architecture and Engineering Depart-ment of the Physical Plant Division, said the tower had become a safety issue because of the area.
“We didn’t want bricks falling on peo-
ple,” Barrand said. “As far as we know, we haven’t had any bricks fall off the historic building.”
Barrand added that this fiscal year the 
university did not receive Public Education Capital Outlay funds, which are used for re-pair and maintenance of campus buildings.
Garcia said every building, no matter the 
age, needs some type of work.
“Emergencies are emergencies,” he said.The potential danger from the possibility 
of falling bricks caused the department to use an available maintenance fund.
University historian Carl Van Ness said 
the building had previously housed the state plant board and the Agricultural Ex-tension Service.
“It had county agents that were there to 
provide advice to farmers,” he said. “The state plant board was in charge if there was a problem with insect invasion.”
The building, Van Ness said, was de-
signed with a collegiate gothic style com-mon to American universities. The horticul-ture building was designed by university architect William Edwards.
Van Ness said it is important to preserve

Of about 200 law schools na-
tionwide, only a few have seen 
increases in applications this year, and UF isn’t one of them.
Preliminary numbers for Fall 
2013 law school applications are down about 23 percent from Fall 2012, according to the Law School Admission Council.
The UF Levin College of Law 
received 2,869 applications for Fall 2012, down from 3,201 for Fall 2011, according to the admissions office.
Robert Jerry, dean of UF Law, 
said the decrease in the job market for new law graduates may have impacted the decline in applica-tions.
Additionally, the rise in tuition 
and student debt levels are impact-ing the number of applicants, ac-cording to the council.
The current in-state tuition for 
30 credit hours at UF Law is about $21,000, up from about $19,000 in 2011-2012. Out-of-state tuition 
is about $41,000, up from about $38,000 in 2011-2012, according to the admissions office.
Despite these 
circumstances, 
Sarah Roddenberry, a 21-year-old UF English senior planning to prac-tice family law, wasn’t discouraged from applying.“I definitely do believe there’s 
an overabundance of lawyers,” she said. “But for me, this is what I’m passionate about, and there’s bound to be jobs somewhere.”
Christina Stine, a 22-year-old 
UF alumna and first-year student at University of Richmond School of Law, is also optimistic about the future.
“I think the real issue is that 
people aren’t open-minded enough about types of jobs,” she said. “Law school is a great base for leadership training, and tons of lawyers go on to do something other than practic-ing law.”
Jerry is remaining positive, 
though he admits changes in the field of law heightened the ef-fect this recession has had on law firms.
“It doesn’t mean the need for 
new law graduates is going to dis-appear,” he said. “We still need prosecutors, public defenders and judges, and we will always have a justice system.”

50% NOGame of Bones: 
Skeleton from 1485 
is Richard III’s
Guys, Britain’s history is so cool. But how cool is it? It’s still 
happening.
“DNA tests have conﬁ  rmed that human remains 
found buried beneath an English car park are those of the coun-try’s King Richard III,” according to a CNN report out of Eng-land.
Yeah, now think of how amazing a “CSI: Wham Bottom 
Lane” series would be.
“The three most commonly known facts of his life are that he 
stole the Crown, murdered his nephews and died wailing for a horse at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485,” wrote Dan Jones, a London-based historian and newspaper columnist.
“Like any black legend, much of it is slander,” Jones said. 
“Richard did indeed usurp the Crown and lose at Bosworth. He probably had his nephews killed too — it is unknowable but overwhelmingly likely.”
This dude had a whole bunch of lies thrown around about 
him while he was alive — so much so that he became one of Shakespeare’s darkest villains.
“What was initially thought to be a barbed arrowhead found 
among the dead king’s vertebrae turned out instead to be a Ro-man nail, disturbed from an earlier level of excavation,” accord-ing to CNN.
How awesome is that? A piece of history fell on top of anoth-
er piece of history and combined into a weird force of rumor.
“So the discovery of Richard’s bones is exciting,” Jones wrote. 
“But it does not tell us anything to justify changing the current historical view of Richard: that the Tudor historians and propa-gandists, culminating with Shakespeare, may have exaggerated his physical deformities and the horrors of Richard’s character, but he remains a criminal king whose actions wrought havoc on his realm.”
Imagine what rumors, either true or not, are spread about 
our current world leaders and how that may affect our future’s history. Future-history, which is almost an abstract concept, de-pends on how we chronicle things today. It’s up to us to write the articles and create the broadcasts that will shape how the next generations learn history and form their own opinions.
“Despite today’s discovery , we Brits are likely to remain split 
on Richard down the old lines: murdering, crook-backed, dis-sembling Shakespearean monster versus misunderstood, loyal, enlightened, slandered hero,” Jones wrote. “Which is the truth? Somewhere in between. That’s a classic historian’s answer, isn’t it? But it’s also the truth.” 
People could slander your name and reputation tomorrow, 
and it could affect your livelihood later on in life. Richard III had some horrible stuff said about every aspect of his life, and where did he end up? Buried under a church — and later a car park — with a horrible legacy to his name.
Half of that legacy was kind of hearsay. Some of it seems to 
be true.
Let’s work together and prevent our current leaders’ fates.Immortalize them in tweets before historians have to dig 
them up years later.
 A large group of people dine at a restaurant. When 
they are presented the check, the head of the party — who describes herself as a pastor — sees 
an automatic 18 percent tip has been added to the bill.
She crosses out the automatic tip, puts a zero on the 
tip line and scribbles on the check, “I already give God 
10%, why do you get 18?” and writes the title “pastor” next to her signature.
When a picture of the check hit Reddit, it quickly 
went viral and sparked debate about how waiters should be tipped. 
What stuck out to me was I had seen a truck drive 
through campus a few days earlier with a bumper stick-er of the same quote, so this sentiment of skipping out on the tip in the name of the Lord isn’t as isolated as I had hoped it was.
Any veteran waiter could tell you bad tippers are 
the worst, but I think the thing that caused this inci-dent to go viral was the extra dose of indignation.  Of course the retorts, “Because God doesn’t have to pay bills,” or, “Because God can’t mess with your cream of mushroom soup,” could get the appropriate response across, but I think there’s bigger idea here. If you’re so passive-aggressively resentful about giving your cash to the church that paying a $5 tip at an Applebee’s feels like the last straw, you probably aren’t very well-suited for either environment.
Personally, if the service is terrible, terriﬁ  c or oth-
erwise, I always tip at least the customary 15 percent when I eat out because I have learned people carry long memories when it comes to being treated badly.
One time when I was working as a cashier at Lowe’s, 
another cashier pulled me aside and pointed out a woman walking through the aisles.
“I absolutely hate that woman. She was a total b--
-- to me when I was working at customer service two years ago. Be careful when you talk to her.”He hated that woman so 
much he remembered her face after two whole years.
Forget about feelings of 
compassion and goodwill for my fellow man. The fear that I will inspire that sort of ill will in anyone who has met me only once is the reason I’m such a 
consistent tipper.
Apart from fear, though, people should remember 
that many waiters are relying on their tips to make the bulk of their income. Here in Florida, the minimum wage for waiters is only $4.77 because they are expected to make the difference in tips.
Should restaurants drop tipping altogether and in-
stead pay their waiters standard minimum wage?  
I don’t think so. From what I have heard, if you work 
in a decent restaurant during proﬁ  table shifts, your av-erage hourly rate will be signiﬁ  cantly higher than mini-mum wage. Not like, “Pick any BMW from the lot, sir” higher, but compare $12 an hour to $8 an hour, and I bet a few low-level cubicle lackeys would gladly cross over.
Regardless of the few bitter people who skip on the 
tip, waiters and waitresses are still probably better off sticking to the system.
Overall, that pastor should take some advice from 
Proverbs 3:27, which reads, “Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due, when it is in your power to do it.” 
Or, at the very least, she should have taken advice 
from Dave Barry, a Miami Herald humor columnist  who once said, “A person who is nice to you, but rude to the waiter, is not a nice person.”

America’s veins are ﬁ  lled with the carbonated, 
sugary sweetness of Coca-Cola.
These soft drinks have become a part of the 
fabric of America. They are the drinks of our childhood, birthday parties, school lunches and sports games. How-ever, these drinks, and those who sell them, are slowly killing us.
American University is a “Coke university.” Any 
beverage you purchase at AU is produced by, owned by and is a subsidiary of Coca-Cola. From the Eagle’s Nest to the vending machines to the Terrace Dining Room, AU supports the company behind the largest health cri-sis in the U.S.
Yet Coca-Cola is now urging Americans to come to-
gether to ﬁ  ght obesity. In a latest ad campaign entitled “Coming Together,” a soft female voice extols the efforts of Coca-Cola to be a part of the obesity solution over a slowly building piano sonata and images of school chil-dren, families, scientists and ﬂ  ashy graphics.
Don’t buy the deceptive concoction.It is easy to get lulled by Coke’s coercive advertising.A narrator proudly states “All calories count, no mat-
ter where they come from, including Coca-Cola and everything else with calories. And if you eat and drink more calories than you burn off, you’ll gain weight.”
Thank you, Coca-Cola, for that pearl of wisdom.All calories are not created equal, and the mixture 
of high-fructose corn syrup, caramel color, phosphoric 
acid, natural ﬂ  avors and caffeine that make up many of Coca-Co-la’s products are a toxic combi-nation.
I decided to call Coca-Cola to 
learn more about its campaign 
against obesity and was reassured that Coca-Cola is 80 to 90 percent water, and it is part of your daily ﬂ  uid in-take — but not a replacement for water. Coca-Cola for-got to mention the 39 grams of sugar in a 12-ounce Coke, which far exceeds the daily requirements.
Coca-Cola’s duplicity goes beyond a marketing cam-
paign designed to confuse and disorient Americans. It, along with other members of “Big Soda,” have virulent-ly fought efforts to limit the size of soft drinks.
Christine Quinn, a New York City mayoral candi-
date, has received about $10,000 from Coca-Cola, as have many other New York legislators and candidates (Coca-Cola spends millions each year on lobbying, as well.). The company has also brought in the NAACP to ﬁ  ght New York City’s soda ban, despite the fact that obe-sity disproportionately affects minority communities.
Big Soda was also intimately involved in defeating the 
proposed Washington, D.C., soda tax in 2010, spending more than $300,000 for grassroots campaigns, testimony before the city council and likely much more on anti-tax advertisements, which do not need to be reported.
Soft drinks are in many respects the contemporary 
Big Tobacco. Its coffers are deep, and it is supported by misinformation, denial and millions of dollars in lobby-ing.
The impact is just as severe. America’s addiction to 
soft drinks is a public health and food crisis, and blame can be placed squarely on the largest drug dealer, Coca-Cola.
Although Coca-Cola may proclaim a can of Coke is 
“140 happy calories,” those 140 calories — all from sug-ar — are very different from the 140 calories in a banana. The deliberate distortions of Coca-Cola are deplorable but not all that surprising. 
Its rebranding effort is a pathetic attempt to extend 
an addiction of its own creation — an addiction that must end.

UWireI like haters.
It might be an unpopular opin-
ion, but I stand by it.
Haters ﬁ  ll an important role in our 
society.
Without haters, we’re surrounded 
by yes-men, and our bad ideas are 
bounced back and forth by similar minds, strengthening the conviction behind the bad idea without ever im-proving it.
A hater will say with a maniacal 
giggle when an idea isn’t worth the air it took to speak it.
Without haters, we become a society 
that rewards effort over results, where everyone gave their best and that’s OK. A company modeled like that goes out of business due to lack of quality re-sults.
A hater will gladly tell someone that 
he or she failed.
Without haters, discourse is at a 
minimum. No one gets up in arms over a controversial decision because there’s no opposing viewpoint or party to care that a decision was made.
A hater will tell anyone who listens 
when something is horrible (even if it isn’t).
I like haters.I should — I am one.When I’m watching sports, I’m a 
hater. I want my team to win, so I hate on the oppos-ing team. I hate on the referees (doesn’t everyone, though?), and I hate on my own team when they blow a winnable game.
When some-
one on Facebook can’t be bothered to type out “you” or “are” and result to single letters, I am most deﬁ  nitely a hater. When people online are too lazy to type while respecting the most basic of grammar rules, I want to be a furious hater hell-bent on bringing offenders to justice. Instead, I must resign myself to glaring at a monitor.
When I have to wake up at 7 a.m. 
for my two-hour microeconomics class, I hate my clock and my past self for picking such an early class. I also thank myself because one soda later, I’m the most alert I’ll be all day, just in time to process all the information.
The hater I was tried to spite me and 
failed, which makes the rest of my day.
Proving a hater wrong has been a 
staple of American culture.
Haters are inspiring people. They 
are inspiring because it is such a rush when they are proven wrong. 
Everyone who has made his or her dream come true publicly thanks those who supported him or her the whole way , but I guarantee there is at least one person in the back of his or her mind that he or she is thinking of, that one person who said no, who said they would never make it, who never once had an ounce of faith in his or her abili-ties.
Haters are useful in the political 
realm, too. The sheer amount of haters in both major parties makes elections both exciting and entertaining. If one member of a party slips up, the other side’s legion of haters will be on that gaff in a heartbeat. Haters keep politi-cians accountable.
Critics, whether for movies, music 
or art, are haters who get paid to be hat-ers. That’s awesome — a whole indus-try exists in which people are required to be haters. And just as awesomely , people can choose to disregard the hat-ers’ opinions.
Haters make the world go ‘round, 
and for that, we should be appreciative. If haters are frowned upon, everyone is a hater, and no one wins.
Haters gonna hate, but I show them 
some love.

opinions@alligator.orgStudents Party opposes campaign restrictions 
Over the summer, the Swamp Party’s candidate for Stu-
dent Body president, Christina Bonarrigo, authored a bill 
that restricts the rights of University of Florida students to freely discuss campus issues.    
The bill put into place election codes that prevent students 
from exercising their First Amendment right to free speech. These codes mean that, as a student, you are not allowed to debate political issues that affect our university without fear of ﬁ  ne or disqualiﬁ  cation because that debate is limited to a seven-day campaigning period.    
The Students Party stands for freedom of speech. The 
Students Party values the opinions of all UF students. The Students Party believes students should be able to discuss campus issues any time they want to — not just when Bonar-rigo says they can.     
Members of the Students Party did everything they could 
to prevent Bonarrigo’s bill from becoming law. 
To stall the bill and prevent it from becoming law on this 
campus, Students Party senators even resorted to leaving the Senate chambers, but unfortunately, even with this bold ac-tion, it passed with the support of current Swamp senators.           
In an attempt to restore full freedom of speech, we have 
fought to amend these codes, but Bonarrigo has prevented us from even debating our amendments in the public square.   
These codes, and Bonarrigo’s support of them, represent a 
direct attack on our constitutionally guaranteed right to free-dom of speech.
How can we make this university a better place for stu-
dents if we are forbidden from talking about issues like cor-ruption and improving student life until only one week be-fore a student election? Why is having an open dialogue so frightening to Bonarrigo and members of her party?
We believe that democracy only functions when there is 
healthy debate about opposing ideas.  
The Students Party maintains that the codes limiting free-
dom of speech are unlawful. 
They are also fundamentally un-American and an affront 
to democracy on this campus.

Early morning classes might 
not be a problem anymore. Flor -
ida’s 13th university could be 
completely online.
In 2012, the Board of Gover -
nors hired a consulting firm to study online education in Flori-da.
The Parthenon Group, which 
conducted the four-month study , revealed its findings last month — providing options for the cre-ation, development and growth of online learning models.
Currently , stakeholders and 
lawmakers continue to evaluate each option, including the pro-posal for an online state institu-tion.
A BOG staff member said 
with each option, the goal is to enhance the state’s global posi-tion in online education while setting the standard for online learning at Florida institutions.
Every public college and 
university in Florida, except the newly created Florida Polytech-nic University, has an indepen-dent online strategy.
Charlie Mitchell, a UF as-
sistant professor of theater and dance, said he believes the state should focus more on enhancing the online options for the new university instead of establishing another institution.  
As a professor teaching both a 
live lecture and an online section, he said students are losing the benefit of live interaction.
“You can’t be an educator and 
prefer online to live teaching be-cause you’re more in a position to be a content creator online rather than a class leader,” Mitchell said.
Catherine Emihovich, the di-
rector of the Center for Commu-nity Education and the former dean of UF’s College of Educa-tion, shares Mitchell’s concerns.
“The online option may be 
theoretically cheaper but the quality of the education will be diminished,” she said.
The BOG’s Strategic Planning 
Committee will meet this month to discuss how it can provide a world-class online program that prepares students for great ca-reers, according to the BOG.
“There is a certain degree of 
socialization that happens in col-lege,” Mitchell said. “Are we now going to move all of our relation-ships online?”Board of Governors considering

� THE RACE HAS BEEN GOING 
ON FOR 16 YEARS.

Neal Shepherd raced at the 
Swamp Classic for about six con-
secutive years.
Last February was the first time 
he competed at the collegiate level, and he went home with the highest achievement. A vice president of Team Florida, UF’s bike club, said he was excited to defend his title as a senior this year.
But after about 16 years, the 
Swamp Classic, a two-day road race and a fundraiser for Team Florida, was canceled.
Team Florida president Dustin 
White said the club didn’t raise any money at last year’s race because there were not enough participants due to conflicts with other races and the Super Bowl.
White, a 21-year-old UF me-
chanical engineering senior, said the race was scheduled for Super Bowl weekend again. 
“To stop a near 20-year tradition, 
it kind of sucks,” he said. “But we didn’t want to take the chance.”
White added the race was also 
much more expensive to host than in previous years.
“Our major killer on costs was 
police officers [that regulate the race and traffic] on that downtown course,” he said.
Shepherd, a 19-year-old UF ap-
plied physiology and kinesiology major, said the cancellation wasn’t what the club wanted, but it was for the best.
“I am certainly disappointed,” he 
said, “but it was a hit-or-miss.”This year’s Swamp 
Classic race canceled

may be theoretically 
cheaper but the quality 
of the education will be

Downward facing dog could po-
tentially help manage heart rhythm 
problems and improve state of mind.
People who participated in a Uni-
versity of Kansas Medical Center study released last month suffered from shortness of breath and fatigue, which is attributed to the heart dis-ease known as atrial fibrillation.
The study included 49 people who 
have had atrial fibrillation for about five years. 
Many of the participants reported 
their heart rates dropped about five beats per minute after regular yoga workouts, according to Reuters.
The activity is described as a com-
bination of breathing techniques, meditation and physical exercise.
The study found yoga helps im-
prove the general quality of life, anxi-ety and depression.
After yoga, Somaly Nou, a 20-year-
old UF psychology sophomore, said she feels relaxed and optimistic that her day is going to be good.
Qianhui Zhang, a psychology in-
tern at UF’s Counseling and Wellness Center,  said yoga puts people in a place that calls for a lot of focus on the body.
“For yoga, a lot of times when we 
are in our daily functioning, our brain is constantly working, either worrying about the future or ruminating about what happen in the past,” she said. “It raises awareness in not clinging onto some of the thoughts and worries that we usually have.”Heart disease patients

Two anatomic pathology 
residents from UF’s College of 
Veterinary Medicine recently received awards at the annual meeting of the American Col-lege Veterinary Pathologists in Seattle.
Anatomic pathologists 
study body tissues and or -
gans in specimens, in order to determine causes of disease in all animals — including humans.
Angelique Leone, a third-
year resident, was presented with a young investigator award in the national disease section for her poster titled “Giant Cell Meningoencepha-lomyelitis in a Pregnant An-dalusian Mare.”Leone said she is joining 
the veterinary staff as a clini-cal instructor at Disney’s Ani-mal Kingdom to complete a fellowship.            
This will be a stepping 
stone for Leone and her strong interest in exotic zoo animal medicine, said Dr. William Castleman, a faculty member in the UF training program of anatomic veterinary and ana-tomic pathology.
Sophie Wickins, also a 
third-year resident, was grant-ed the 2012 C.L. Davis Foun-dation Scholarship Award for Veterinary Pathology.
Castleman, who presented 
Wickins with the award, said it was difficult to choose the winner among the four in-dividuals finishing up their third-year residency pro-gram.
Wickins said she was both 
surprised and honored to win this award.
“It is a great feeling to have 
your hard work recognized by those around you,” Wick-ins said. “Particularly when it is completely unexpected.”
Castleman, who has 
worked closely with Wickins and Leone, said it’s always great when people in your training program are recog-nized.
“It’s very positive for the 
training program and for the college to have your young people recognized.”

The online program consists of 10  free webinars. Up to 25 employers can register for each session.
Tim Giuliani, president and CEO

“The ‘Employer University’ will

 During Florida’s 78-64 win against 
Ole Miss on Saturday, senior guard 
Kenny Boynton and senior forward Erik Murphy fed off each other’s strengths.
  Murphy scored a team-high 19 
points and Boynton racked up nine assists, tying his career best. Boynton assisted on four of Murphy’s seven shots and 10 of his 19 points. 
  Boynton scored 9 points on 3-of-13 
shooting against the Rebels but found Murphy, who had the hot hand, in the post and behind the arc. Murphy went 7-of-8 shooting and drilled 5 of his 6 three-point attempts. 
  “I wasn’t hitting from the outside, 
but I tried to get my teammates in-volved on other plays,” Boynton said. 
“[Murphy has] done a great job of 
helping me out, knocking down the outside shots.”
  Said Murphy: “I just shoot when 
I’m open. When I don’t shoot when I’m open, coach (Billy Donovan) gets mad.”
  Boynton and Murphy’s synergy 
has been key this season for No. 2 Florida (18-2, 8-0 Southeastern Con-ference), which jumped two spots in this week’s AP poll for its highest ranking since Feb. 12, 2007.

 Lily Svete is everything and nothing you would 
want in a forward. 
  She is intelligent. The junior is a double major 
in psychology and biology , planning on attending 
medical school upon ﬁ  nishing her undergraduate degrees. 
  She regularly wakes up at 6 a.m. to ﬁ  nish school-
work before classes, practice and individual work-outs dominate her schedule. 
  “There’s no distractions,” Svete said. “Finding the 
time to designate two hours and block it out, that’s my trick.”
  Coaches and teammates rave about her.   “In years where she has played less or scored less 
or by the stat sheet seem-ingly had less of a role, she still has always been an an-chor on the team, the most trusted player and the hard-est worker,” coach Amanda 
Butler said.    “Lily is going to be our ﬁ  rst doctor out of the program, so we’re pretty excited about that.” 
  On the court, Svete has physical gifts few others 
can offer. 
  At 6-foot-2, she is the second-tallest player on Flor-
ida’s active roster. And she can shoot. 
  Redshirt freshman Carlie Needles leads the team 
with 41 three-pointers, but Svete is far more efﬁ  cient, making a team-leading 45.5 percent of her threes.
    In Florida’s 87-54 defeat of Alabama on Sunday , 
Svete connected on 4 of her 6 attempts from behind the arc. Three days prior, in a 69-64 loss to Missouri, Svete scored 9 points on 3-of-3 shooting from the three-point line.
  Her 21 points in the last two games is her high-
est-scoring two-game stretch since scoring 22 points combined against Savannah State and Central Michi-gan in late December. 
  Yet the same intelligence that propels her often 
limits her.  Forward shining 
in limited time
END OF GREGULATION
  Florida is the best team in college basket-ball, but it doesn’t ﬁ  t the offensive proﬁ  le of a national champion. 
  The Gators’ offensive efﬁ  ciency, ranked 
second in the nation, can’t be questioned. And there’s no reason for Billy Donovan and his staff to try to ﬁ  x something that isn’t broken.
  Still, UF making a run to the Final Four 
would be nearly unprecedented.  
  In the past 10 years, only two Final Four 
teams have taken a higher percentage of their shots from beyond the arc than 2012-13 Flori-da. And only one of the past 40 Final Four par-ticipants has gotten to the free-throw line at a lower rate. 
  Before I beat you 
over the head with numbers, here’s a lit-tle context. KenPom, a haven for hoops and stats junkies like myself, ranks every Division I team by a 
number of metrics. The 2013 version of Florida differs from the past 10 years of Final Four participants in two major categories. 
  The ﬁ  rst is three-point attempts over ﬁ  eld 
goal attempts, or the percentage of a team’s shots that come from beyond the arc.  
  Florida’s 40.9 percent ranks 26th national-
ly . Consistently , the national average is in the neighborhood of 33.3 percent.
  But, over the past 10 years, elite teams have 
traditionally relied on interior scoring. Only seven Final Four participants in the past 10 years have posted a mark higher than even 35 percent. Again, Florida is currently at 40.9.
  As I said, I’d never advocate the Gators 
change their ways. Erik Murphy is shooting an unreal 51.2 percent from outside. If any-thing, he should be taking more threes, and Donovan has been stressing getting Murphy the ball when he has an open look. Donovan wants all of his shooters to take threes freely and with conﬁ  dence, even when they’re going through a rough patch. 
  Michael Frazier II is shooting 44.3 percent, 
so he needs to keep shooting. Kenny Boynton (35.1), Mike Rosario (35.7) and Scottie Wil-bekin (38.3) are all capable shooters, too. As it is, Boynton is shooting less than he did last year, and Rosario is taking more twos than threes after doing the opposite in 2011-12. 
  By limiting their long twos, the Gators still 
rank near the national average in percentage

Dealing with injuries is part 
of the gig. Replacing production, 
however, isn’t all that easy. 
In Florida’s last two dual 
meets, it dealt with the losses of All-Americans Kytra Hunter and Alaina Johnson to injuries. 
But against No. 19 Arkan-
sas last Friday, Florida (4-1, 3-1 Southeastern Conference) posted the nation’s second highest total with a 197.575 despite both gym-nasts’ absence.
The Gators set season-high 
marks on both floor and beam.
Randy Stageberg pinned a 9.9 
on beam to jump start the rota-tion. Coach Rhonda Faehn said Stageberg’s performance was the senior’s best showing this sea-son. 
“Finishing on balance beam at 
a road competition is a high-pres-sure situation,” Faehn said.
“You always want your ath-
letes to go out and compete ag-gressively no matter what hap-pens, and they did that starting from Randy.”
Faehn applauded her gym-nasts’ efforts to fill increased roles while Johnson and Hunter fought through injuries during the last two meets.
Johnson has been inactive 
since Jan. 18 with a stress reaction in her back.
Faehn said the team is moni-
toring her situation on a weekly basis but fully expects her to be available in three weeks.
Hunter, on the other hand, has 
a better outlook.
Faehn expects Hunter to com-
pete in all four events against Al-abama on Friday at 7 p.m. in the O’Connell Center. Hunter per -
formed exclusively on bars ver -
sus Arkansas due to a ligament strain in her ankle.
Despite Hunter’s limitations 
with her ankle, Faehn suggested that the sophomore could have been called upon to compete in additional events if necessary. 
“For [Hunter], it’s a matter of 
making sure — and it is for every one of our gymnasts, they’re all battling things — it’s a matter of making sure every meet that we are able to rest some while others step up,” Faehn said. 
In spite of a limited lineup, the Gators posted scores of 49.450 and 49.275 on beam and floor, respectively, against the Razor -
backs. Bridget Sloan earned the evening’s beam title while Maris-sa King recorded a season-high 9.9. 
“Marissa was very reminis-
cent of every single one of her routines she competed (in) last year,” Faehn said.
Faehn was pleased with the 
number of stuck landings regis-tered against Arkansas. 
“I know I have been saying 
that a lot, but really each meet it gets a little better and better,” Sloan said. 
With five consecutive meets 
against ranked opponents sched-uled before the SEC Champion-ships begin on March 23 in Little Rock, Ark., Faehn wants her gymnasts dialed in. 
“Looking into Friday’s compe-
tition, our athletes know that our goal is to go out there and really only, once again, compete against ourselves,” Faehn said. “Obvi-ously, Alabama will be there but we cannot focus on them or con-trol what they’re going to do on the competition floor.”

GYMNASTICSFlorida battling injuries as it prepares for stretch runBoynton has assisted on 7 of Mur -
phy’s 24 three-pointers and 31 of 
his 112 points. 
In eight SEC games, Boynton 
has averaged 4.3 assists — 1.5 more than his career average. His assist-to-turnover ratio of 5.7 in conference play is the highest in the SEC.  
The Gators won the assists bat-
tle against the Rebels 23-5 on Sat-urday. Ultimately, Boynton was responsible for 31 of Florida’s 78 points. 
“[Boynton is] finally getting an 
understanding that he can really impact the game in a lot of different ways,” Donovan said. “Through experience, going through what he’s going through, he’s become a very, very good decision-maker. He’s made other people on the floor better.”
Murphy has averaged a team-
high 14 points and shot an SEC-best 57.1 percent from beyond the arc during league play. Missouri guard Earnest Ross’ 48.6 percent clip from three-point range is the next-best average in the confer -
ence. 
“[Murphy is] more confident 
now,” junior forward Will Yeguete said. “[Donovan] really wants him to shoot the ball when he’s open, and we all really want him to shoot the ball.
“I think he’s doing a good job 
of taking open shots, and he’s been making [them], so we just have to keep looking for him.”
Boynton and Murphy will look 
to keep No. 2 Florida’s offense flowing when it travels to Fayette-ville, Ark., to face Arkansas tonight at 7. 
The Razorbacks (13-8, 4-4 SEC) 
are No. 13 in the conference de-fensively, allowing 68.3 points per 
game. 
But Arkansas 
is a better scoring team at home, tal-lying 73 or more points 12 times and boasting a 12-1 record at Bud Walton Arena. 
Second-year coach Mike Ander -
son’s Razorbacks have shot 47.3 percent at home but 41.5 percent on the road and at neutral sites. 
“Those numbers are drastically 
different,” Donovan said. “There’s probably a comfort level, a confi-dence level, for those guys playing in Fayetteville.”
Saturday’s box score incorrectly 
credited Boynton with an assist on 
Murphy’s three-point field goal at the 10:42 mark in the first half. Rosario, who dribbled the ball twice and then passed it to Murphy, should have been credited with the assist on the play.Svete struggles defensively 
at times, as she commonly is 
a step slow or a second late in reacting. She averages just 16.8 minutes per contest because when her shot isn’t falling, her production slips. 
“Lily sometimes is too smart 
because she thinks things out so much and analyzes and that’s really been kind of a paralyz-ing, limiting thing for her,” But-ler said. 
Svete has been held score-
less in five games this season and scored less than four points on six other occasions. 
But when she finds her 
groove, she can score in bunch-es. Svete dropped a season-high 15 points in just 22 minutes against Savannah State on Dec. 20. She scored 14 points in 15 minutes against Troy on Dec. 4. 
“It’s all confidence,” Svete 
said. “That’s what I’ve learned as a shooter and being here the last four years. The more confi-dent you are, the easier it is to knock down shots.”
UF will need her to continue 
making shots down the stretch. As of Monday , the Gators were fifth in the Southeastern Con-ference in scoring, averaging 67.8 points per contest. 
Despite the respectable 
ranking, UF struggles to put to-gether two consistent halves of offense. Svete gives the Gators another scoring threat to help break the trend.
“We talk a lot about winning 
the battle of the paint,” Butler said. “It certainly makes the battle to your advantage when you have a shooter like Lily that makes defenders make deci-sions.”
Contact Phillip Heilman at 
pheilman@alligator.org.of shots taken at the rim. That’s a big deal for UF, since it ranks second nationally by shoot-ing 74 percent on shots at the rim.
So nothing about UF’s offense should 
change. Still, sustaining an offense rooted in outside shooting is difficult. 
The two teams that reached the Final Four 
shooting more threes than 2013 Florida were VCU in 2011 and Louisville in 2005. (Interest-ingly, former Donovan assistant Shaka Smart coached VCU, while Rick Pitino, Donovan’s mentor, coached Louisville.)
In 2011, VCU hit 46.2 percent of its threes in 
a Sweet 16 win against FSU and 48 percent in an Elite 8 win against Kansas. It shot a pedes-trian 36.4 percent from beyond the arc in the Final Four, and thus lost to Butler. 
In 2005, Louisville hit 42.3 percent of its 
threes in a Sweet 16 win against Washington and 39.3 percent in an Elite 8 win against West Virginia. It shot 30 percent in a Final Four loss to Illinois.  
So UF faces an uphill battle. Of course, the 
Gators can rely on the NCAA’s best defense if and when things get rough from outside.
But — and this is the second point that 
sets Florida apart from the typical Final Four team — the Gators have not been able to get to the free-throw line for easy points in 2012-13. Another KenPom metric is free throw at-tempts over field goal attempts, a figure that is multiplied by 100 to produce a national aver -age usually around 37. Basically , it shows how often teams earn trips to the free-throw line. 
Right now, Florida ranks No. 308 nation-
ally with a 29.7. In the past 10 years, only one Final Four team has posted a worse rate. 
In 2005, Illinois made the Final Four with 
a 28.8. Not coincidentally, the Illini are also fourth in the past 10 years in highest percent-age of three-point shots. Teams shooting the ball from outside aren’t getting fouled and aren’t going to the line for easy points. 
Continuing the trend, Illinois shot 45 per -
cent beyond the arc in a Sweet 16 win against Wisconsin-Milwaukee, 45.7 percent in an Elite Eight win against Arizona and 40 percent in a Final Four win against aforementioned Louis-ville. It shot 30 percent from outside in a na-tional title game loss to UNC. 
This isn’t exactly groundbreaking stuff. 
Teams that rely on three pointers struggle when they can’t hit three pointers.  But the rea-son it is worth discussing is because a rough patch from outside is bound to happen even-tually . Shooting from beyond the arc naturally has high variance — swings happen with regularity . 
Maybe the Gators will stay hot, drilling 
three after three en route to a Final Four ap-pearance and a national title. Or maybe they won’t, and a dominant defense will pick up the slack and get Florida there anyway. 
Either way, 2012-13 Florida provides a test 
case, the likes of which has rarely succeeded in college basketball.

  While everybody recovers from a 
blackout in New Orleans, the al-ligatorSports staff wants to take a 
moment to look at former Gators playing bas-ketball and football. In which league do Gators make the biggest impact? Columnists Adam Pincus and Josh Jurnovoy tackle the question.
  Adam: It’s all about the NFL. Maybe I’m still 
experiencing a New Orleans hangover after spending time in the Big Easy during Super Bowl week, but Gators are all over the foot-ball landscape. The big names are obvious. You have Percy Harvin, the Pouncey twins and that Tim Tebow dude. 49ers defensive tackle Ray McDonald recorded three tackles and a sack in Super Bowl XLVII. Ravens wide receiver Deonte Thompson was inactive for the game. He’ll still get a ring. There were 26 active former Gators playing during Week 17. There are 10 former Billy D disciples on NBA rosters. Granted, NBA teams ﬁ  eld fewer play-ers, but no basketball player dictates media coverage from the bench. That will be the last Tebow reference, I promise.
  Josh: Sure, let’s end the debate now if 
we are going to talk about media cover-age. Tebow wins hands down. But I’ll take Gator basketball if we are talking about impact in every sense other than what gets the most mentions on SportsCenter.Even if you believe Tebow hasn’t received a fair chance in the NFL yet as I do, you can’t deny that his on-ﬁ  eld contributions have been few and far between. He had just 32 rushes and eight pass attempts in 2012. The only Gators in the NFL that I’d say are playing at an elite level are the Pouncey twins, Janoris Jen-kins, Joe Haden, Percy Harvin (whenever he happens to be healthy) and Aaron Hernandez.For a sport where active rosters are almost a fourth of the size of that of the NFL, it is clear that Gator basketball players are making greater proportional impact.
  Adam: Josh, you forgot Brandon Spikes and Will Hill. I’m sure 
your mom banned you from their racy Twitter accounts, so that’s probably why you didn’t mention them.
  We’re talking 
about impact. Who impacts their sport the most? Does it really matter that David Lee is having the best season out of any former Gators player if he’s doing it for the Golden State Warriors? He’s averaging 19.4 points, 11.1 rebounds and four assists per game. That’s hard to do during an NBA 2K13 season. Too bad nobody has been paying attention. 
  Lee, Chandler Parsons, Joakim Noah, and 
Al Horford are having the best seasons of any former Florida ballers. They all play either forward or center. In the NFL, these Gators are lining up at offen-sive line, wide receiv-er, cornerback, defen-sive line, linebacker and safety . When was the last time a former 
Gators point guard made any noise in the NBA ... Jason “White Chocolate” Williams? 
  Josh: I’m not sure why you are so eager for 
Will Hill to be included among the elite Gators in the NFL. Hill was suspended four games for violating the league’s substance abuse policy and recorded two or fewer tackles in six of the games in which he played. While Spikes has been a proliﬁ  c tackler, he has been iffy at times in coverage and has yet to make a Pro Bowl. Al Horford has already made two All-Star teams for the Hawks. This year, four other Gators will be represented at All-Star weekend — Brad Beal and Chandler Parsons will be in the Ris-ing Stars Game, and Joakim Noah and Lee will be in the All-Star Game. Lee, Noah and Hor-ford’s ﬁ  ve combined All-Star Game appear-ances equals the total Pro Bowl appearances of the 26 Gators in the NFL. The guards aren’t making the same impact, but the big men are doing as much to earn respect throughout the league as their NFL counterparts.
  Adam: As usual, you fail to grasp any humor 
thrown your way . I wasn’t including Spikes or Hill. I was making fun of you. Returning to my point, UF football ranks fourth with 106 draftees from 1992-2011 and fourth with 3,463 starts from former players during that time. Florida’s NBA players made 30 fewer starts during that span. No, I can’t count that high, so don’t ask. This means there have been far more Gators in the NFL. History has repeated itself with this latest batch of players on the gridiron and hardwood.
  Josh: We’re not talking about which program’s 
impact was bigger in 2011. We’re in 2013. Ad-
mittedly , the bigger argument the NFL Gators have going for them is their impact at a mul-titude of positions whereas only the big men are producing on the basketball side. Beal was the Eastern Conference Rookie of the Month in January, shooting better than 50 percent from three-point range. It took him a while to ﬁ  nd his stroke during his one season in Gainesville, but it didn’t leave him once he did. If he can just stay somewhere between 40 and 50 per-cent going forward, he will break the trend of struggling Gator guards. Then, Florida will have ﬁ  ve All-Star quality NBA players in a league that has a fraction of the All-Stars that football does. I’ll take quality over quantity.
