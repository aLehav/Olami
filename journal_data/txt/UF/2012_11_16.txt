 Florida fans may be bored with Louisiana 
and Jacksonville State coming to town, but 
don’t expect athletics director Jeremy Foley to apologize for the Gators’ mid-November lull. Consecutive games against the Ragin’ Cajuns and the Gamecocks are welcomed. Playing the little guys keeps the lights on.
  Foley is just happy the schedule is full.  Since the NCAA added a 12th game to the 
schedule prior to the 2006 season, Foley said ﬁ  lling out the Gators’ slate each year has prov-en challenging.
  “It’s just ﬁ  nding teams that want to play 
you,” Foley said. “Everybody is scrambling to get opponents.”
  Every team ranked in the top 10 of the BCS 
standings has played at least two non-BCS op-ponents this season.
  The Gators also need to schedule opponents 
who will play in The Swamp. While Southeast-ern Conference schools Georgia and Alabama have recently played home-and-home series with Arizona State and Penn State, Florida needs the dollars from home games.
  According to UF’s 2011-12 athletic budget, 
the Gators made $2.3 million per home football game last year. Football, which supports Flori-da’s other 20 sports, accounted for 65 percent of the UAA’s revenue last season.
  Next season, the Gators will host fewer than 
seven home games in a single season for the ﬁ  rst time since 2005. Florida will play at Miami on Sept. 7, 2013, as part of a home-and-home series. The Gators defeated the Hurricanes 26-3 in The Swamp in 2008.
  “When you’re taking a game off campus, it’s 
costing you money ,” Foley said. “We’ve been setting aside money in our budget since 2008 to make up for the loss we’re going to have next year by not having seven home football games. If you did that every year, you’d drastically af-fect the ability to run this program.”
  Meanwhile, Alabama coach Nick Saban has 
made a habit of playing competitive openers since arriving in Tuscaloosa, Ala., in 2007. In six seasons under Saban, the Crimson Tide has faced a top-10 team in three season openers and played a ranked foe within the ﬁ  rst two weeks for ﬁ  ve consecutive years.
  “It’s good for our fans to have a national 
game that they can look forward to,” Saban said. “It helps our team develop in the offsea-son as well as in fall camp, having a challenge like that early on. I do think it has prepared us for a lot of the tough games in our league.”
     
  The Swamp was drying up.  As Louisiana’s Blake Comminie scampered 
into the end zone after scooping up a blocked punt, Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium fell silent. For the third time in less than a year, Florida trailed a non-BCS opponent at home.
  “For the ﬁ  rst time all season at home, I 
thought to myself, ‘We’re going to lose this game,’” said Freddy Masterson, the UF Fightin’ Gator Marching Band drum major. “I let it get the best of me.”
  After entering the game as a 26.5-point 
favorite, Florida’s 49-game winning streak against non-BCS foes was in jeopardy. UF’s last loss to a non-BCS team was against Memphis State in 1988.
  In 18 games against non-BCS foes since the 
12th game was added in 2006, Florida has out-scored its overmatched opposition by more than 38 points per contest. The Gators eclipsed the 50-point mark in eight of those games.
  “The only way the fans can vote is by not 
showing up, by being apathetic about it,” ESPN College GameDay host Chris Fowler said. “You see that in a lot of places. (There are) a lot more empty seats than you’re used to seeing from 
some big teams, because the matchups just 
don’t warrant it.”
  Win or lose, Louisiana helped Florida extend 
an ongoing streak. Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium failed to sell out for a ﬁ  fth consecutive contest against a non-BCS opponent.
  Prior to 2011, UF had notched 137 consecu-
tive home sellouts, which at the time was the fourth-longest active streak.
  Attendance for the Gators’ win against the 
Ragin’ Cajuns was listed as 86,482. But when Loucheiz Purifoy blocked a fourth-quarter punt and Jelani Jenkins returned it 36 yards for the game-winning touchdown, not even 60,000 fans were around to cheer.
  Few cared about a game in which UF had 
little to gain and much to lose. 
  “Scheduling games that are exciting for the 
players and the fans is important,” Fowler said. “You’ve got some very soft scheduling that is anti-college football.”
  The last time the Gators opened the season 
with a non-conference BCS opponent was 1990 — Spurrier’s ﬁ  rst game as UF’s coach.
  Florida defeated Oklahoma State 50-7, 
starting the Gators’ current 23-game win-ning streak in openers. Twenty-one of those victories came against non-BCS foes.
       
  When UF leaves Gainesville for a non-con-
ference game, the trips are usually short.
  Excluding a visit to Tallahassee every other 
year to face Florida State, Florida’s last two non-
conference road games were against Miami in 
Coral Gables in 2003 and Syracuse in Syracuse, N.Y., in 1991.
  When asked why the Gators had not left the 
Sunshine State for a non-conference game since his second season in Gainesville, South Caro-lina coach Steve Spurrier was frank.
  “Because Florida doesn’t have to,” he said. 
“[Florida has] plenty of tough competition without trying to ﬁ  nd three major opponents.”
  The Gators boast one of the toughest sched-
ules in the nation this season with games against half of the top-10 teams in the BCS standings. Florida is 3-1 with a matchup against BCS No. 10 Florida State looming on Nov. 24.
  “You look at our record,” Muschamp said. 
“You look at our schedule and what we’ve ac-complished this year. We’ve had a hell of a year.”    
   
  Florida’s 27-20 win against Louisiana meant 
the world to the Ragin’ Cajuns. Already elimi-nated from Sun Belt Conference title conten-tion, Louisiana needed something to play for. Even in defeat, the Ragin’ Cajuns were conﬁ  -dent and composed.
  “I know everyone in the locker room feels 
bad, but we also know we should have won this game,” Louisiana wide receiver Harry Peo-ples said. “The next game and the next game and the next game and the next game, we are going to show that we should have won.”
  Peoples tallied 73 yards on 10 catches against 
Florida, marking the most receptions by an op-posing wideout this season. After reviewing the ﬁ  lm, Peoples' conﬁ  dence soared even higher.
  “We should have beat them, (by) at least 
two touchdowns maybe,” Peoples said on Monday.
  Ragin’ Cajuns coach Mark Hudspeth added: 
“Their conﬁ  dence level, to me, has never been higher.”
  Ole Miss coach Hugh Freeze knows the 
feeling. As the head coach of Arkansas State in 2011, Freeze consistently emphasized to his players the signiﬁ  cance of opportunities to play against top-notch BCS schools.
  “We used it as a platform to show that we 
were competitive,” Freeze said.
  Freeze saw a change in Arkansas State after 
a 26-7 loss to eventual Atlantic Coast Confer-ence Coastal Division champion Virginia Tech last season. Following their loss to the Hokies, the Red Wolves won nine straight games to clinch the Sun Belt Conference championship and earn a bid to the GoDaddy.com Bowl.
  “A lot of it has to do with the leadership of 
your team,” Freeze said. “If the leadership of your team says, ‘Hey , this shows what we can do, and let’s get into conference play and do something special.’ We were fortunate to have that kind of leadership.”
  Foley touted how UF's games against non-
BCS opponents aid the visiting school. Accord-ing to a UF spokesperson, Florida paid Bowling Green $1.25 million, Louisiana earned $1 mil-lion and Jacksonville State will receive $500,000 for Saturday’s game.
  The Ragin’ Cajuns’ check from the Gators 
is worth 8 percent of Louisiana’s $12.5 million athletic budget, which includes $5.1 million in state funds.
  “Honestly, it’s a win-win situation,” Fo-
ley said. “Fans don’t all see that. But the money we pay them very much helps them run their athletic programs. We have to have a game. We have to ﬁ  ll in a certain date. The process of scheduling is very , very difﬁ  cult. You have to ﬁ  nd people that are available. You have to ﬁ  nd people that (are) interested.”
         Since Muschamp took over as Florida’s 
coach in 2011, one of the philosophies he has stressed is that every opponent on the schedule is a “nameless, faceless” team.
  “It’s the next game,” Muschamp said on Oct. 
22 of playing Georgia. “That’s why it’s the most important game.”
  His attitude remained unchanged leading 
up to last Saturday’s win against Louisiana.
  “It’s all the same to me,” Muschamp said on 
Nov. 5.
  On Tuesday , offensive coordinator Brent 
Pease said of preparing for Jacksonville State: “It’s our same approach every week. You go out, and you got a standard you want to play to.”
  Despite the same preparation week after 
week, the Gators manhandled LSU but went down to the wire against the Ragin’ Cajuns.
  In Florida’s past three games against non-
BCS opponents, the Gators have trailed. They have started slow and relied on late surges to avoid upsets.
  In more than 20 years as a collegiate coach, 
Spurrier has avoided upsets against non-BCS foes. Even Spurrier, known for his brutal hon-esty when discussing opposing teams, said he approaches each opponent similarly.
  “You only have 12-13 [games], sometimes 
14,” he said. “There’s no excuse if you’re not ready to play.”
  Foley understands fans’ frustrations when 
Florida plays sub-par competition. He said his goal is to have the Gators play as many enter-taining games as possible.
  But playing a high-proﬁ  le game every week 
is simply implausible with a 12-game schedule. Not when UF needs to stay at home to keep the revenue ﬂ  owing.
Besides, Foley does not think the Florida 
faithful mind the extra victories too much.
  “Every fan we have, I think, has the same 
goal,” Foley said. “One is to get to Atlanta and another one is to try to get to the last football game of the year. Scheduling is a big part of that conversation.”

Louisiana running back Alonzo Harris (46) bursts through a pack of defenders to score in 
UF’s 27-20 win. Unlike most non-BCS teams, the Ragin’ Cajuns tested the Gators. 
David Carr / Alligator Staff
Josh Evans (9) and the Gators have typically beaten up on their non-BCS opponents, defeating them by an 
average of 38.2 points per game since 2006. The games generate dollars but little interest among fans.

Turlington Plaza was packed 
but divided Thursday afternoon.
At about 12:30 p.m., about 100 
UF students rallied in response to 
the rocket attacks in southern Isra-el and Gaza launched by Palestin-ian militants.
According to CNN, more than 
300 rockets have been launched since Wednesday as part of the lat-est developments in the historical conﬂ  ict stemming from cultural differences. 
The military leader of Hamas, 
an Islamic political party with a militant wing, was assassinated earlier this week. Palestinian rock-ets have killed at least 18 people.  
“For the last decade, Israeli civil-
ians around the Gaza Strip, which is a little piece of land, have been living under the threat of rocket ﬁ  re,” said Josh Kahn, the Jewish Agency Israel Fellow to UF Hillel.
The 28-year-old helped orga-
nize the pro-Israel rally, which was put together Wednesday night by varying Jewish organizations on UF’s campus.
“This is being ﬁ  red discrimi-
nately at neighborhoods,” he said. “These are not military targets. It’s literally schools and houses.”

Pedro Bravo will face addi-
tional charges in the Christian 
Aguilar murder case after an Alachua County grand jury met Thursday.
The grand jury indicted 
Bravo, 18, on ﬁ  ve new charges, which suggests he may have drugged and suffocated Agui-lar, an 18-year-old UF fresh-man, in addition to the ﬁ  rst-degree murder and kidnapping indictment he received Oct. 8, according to court records from the Alachua County Clerk of the Court. 
Bravo was charged with 
poisoning food and/or water with the intent to kill or injure a person, lying to police, ﬁ  ling a false police report and illegally moving human remains.
The grand jury also charged 
Bravo with tampering with physical evidence when he tried to hide duct tape, a shovel and Aguilar’s personal belong-ings as well as attempting to bury the body , according to the court records.
Aguilar and Bravo were for-
mer classmates who graduated from Doral Academy Prepa-ratory School together before coming up to Gainesville to at-tend college.
While Aguilar studied bio-medical engineering at UF, Bravo went to Santa Fe Col-lege, where he was enrolled in two classes, said one of Bravo’s roommates in an interview.
On Sept. 20, Aguilar was last 
seen with Bravo walking into a southwest Gainesville Best Buy , where Aguilar planned to buy Kanye West’s new album “Cruel Summer,” according to Alligator archives. 
The next day , Aguilar was 
reported missing to Univer-sity Police. In an interview with Gainesville Police, Bravo told detectives he beat Agui-lar and left him in a northwest Gainesville parking lot. 
On Sept. 24, police arrested 
Bravo on a charge of depriving a victim of medical care and booked him into the Alachua County Jail, where he remains as of Thursday night.
For the next month, 
Aguilar’s family , along with Gainesville and Miami resi-dents, teamed up with police to search for Christian Aguilar, combing through woods and swamps across the area.
During the investigation, 
police said they found blood inside Bravo’s 2004 Chevy Trailblazer, Aguilar’s backpack in Bravo’s closet, and a receipt that showed Bravo purchased a roll of duct tape and shovel four Jury adds five 
new charges to Aguilar case

UF students, faculty and staff could get a 
four-day weekend again for Homecoming.
Associate Provost for Undergraduate 
Affairs Bernard Mair introduced the topic 
at Thursday’s UF Faculty Senate meeting, saying that the most feasible date for Home-coming 2013 is Nov. 8, which leads into Vet-erans Day weekend.The only October home game on next 
year’s football schedule is Oct. 5, which Mair said is too early for Homecoming activities.
The Faculty Senate will vote in December 
to ﬁ  nalize the date for Homecoming.
Mair also reminded the Faculty Senate 
that this Monday and Tuesday are not holi-days, although classes are canceled Wednes-day. He said students are required to attend school as normal.
Also at the meeting, Faculty Senate Chair Cheri Brodeur updated at-tendees about the ongoing search for UF’s next presi-dent. She said questions for applicants are being ﬁ  nalized, which means 
the interviews themselves may not be too far off.
“When it happens, it 
will be very fast,” she said.
Associate Provost for Teaching and Technology Andy McCollough gave details about the university’s partnership with on-line learning program Coursera.
He said ﬁ  ve not-for-credit UF courses 
will be offered starting next year: Economic Issues Food and You; Fundamentals of Hu-man Nutrition; Global Sustainable Energy: Past, Present and Future; Sustainable Ag-riculture/Urban Land Management; and How Music Works.

The Wienermobile made an appearance on the North Lawn on Thursday afternoon. Representatives 
from Oscar Mayer are recruiting college grads to become “Hotdoggers” and travel the country.
COLLEEN WRIGHT
Alligator Contributing Writer
The Oscar Mayer Wienermo-
bile rolled on to the North Lawn on 
Wednesday to meet potential “Hot-doggers” for 2013.
Many UF students stopped by for 
photo ops and cheeky comments, but some could end up as “Hotdoggers,” the name for the group of 12 recent college graduates who drive the Wie-nermobile full time around the coun-try to promote Oscar Mayer.
Hotdoggers Eliot Pattee and Ang-
gela C. Pimentel Warstonh, who go by the aliases of Deli Eliot and Anggie Dog, said although the recruitment process begins in February, they’re trying to raise awareness on campus for the job.
“They love the Wienermobile, and 
by extension, they love us,” said 25-year-old Warstonh.
Warstonh said the 24-foot-long 
Wienermobile, which has a Chevy Chassis base, is easy to drive. Hotdoggers have two weeks of 
training at Hot Dog High in Madison, Wis., to learn to drive the vehicle.
Pattee and Warstonh cover the 
southeast U.S. 
They said Oscar Mayer recruits 
heavily from 10 different campuses, including UF and Florida Internation-al University.

For Ericka, her job is a chance to feel like ev-
eryone else. Every day, she spends hours tak-
ing apart computers, cutting cords and sorting remotes.
“We use all kinds of stuff in here,” she 
said, smiling proudly as she ﬁ  ddled with her tools. “I work Monday , Tuesday , Wednesday , Thursday and Friday.”
But if state disability cuts go through, her 
work at the Arc of Alachua County could be cut back, and she’ll spend those off hours in her group home instead of the busy produc-tion room.
The Arc is part of a national nonproﬁ  t orga-
nization that gives developmentally disabled adults services and employment, said Jason Hines, spokesman for the Arc. The organiza-tion can’t give out the last names of its clients, like Ericka, due to HIPPA law.
Ericka is one of about 300 developmentally disabled individuals at the Arc who depend on a Medicaid waiver to receive important ser-vices, including employment opportunities.
The Florida Agency for Persons with Dis-
abilities is trying to cut back Medicaid waivers by 40 percent across the state. The Arc is trying to ﬁ  ght the cuts by telling its members to write the agency and ask for a hearing, said Dick Bradley, head director of the Arc.
“Funding cannot be cut until the hearings 
are over,” he said.
Nearly all of Arc’s participants are recipi-
ents and are at risk for losing some of the ser-vices. However, the organization is challeng-ing the state because the state is trying to cut services it previously described as “medically necessary.”
If the waivers are reduced, those who work 
at the Arc will have fewer options for services, such as cutting back on the number of days they visit the organization or getting rid of their paid transportation. 
Paying for services privately is also an op-
tion, but that’s too expensive for many of the clients, Bradley said.
He said the original legislation was meant 
to level the playing ﬁ  eld between overfunded and underfunded organizations. 
The legislation aimed to give money to the 
areas that needed help and cut back funding on areas that had more than enough money.
Bradley said there are 30,000 people on the 
Medicaid waiver across the state and another 20,000 on the waiting list.
In fact, Hines said Florida is 49th out of 50 
when it comes to funding for the developmen-tally disabled.
Mark Lister, owner of the Behavioral Anal-ysis Support Service, said the clients at the Arc will have a difﬁ  cult time transitioning to fewer services if the waivers are cut.
Lister, who works with Arc clients, said 
many who work there have Prader-Willi Syn-drome, a noninherited genetic disorder char-acterized by an insatiable urge to eat and mild intellectual disability . 
He said they need constant monitoring of 
their diet and exercise, and these cuts may force disruptions.
Bradley said if the cuts force clients to stay 
in their group homes for a few days during the week, the Arc would have to hire staff to be at the home, using money that would not be reimbursed by the state.
“This is just the latest challenge. They’ve 
been cutting for nine years in a row and it just gets more and more difﬁ  cult,” Bradley said. “But, at the end of the day, The Arc has served people with developmental disabilities in this community for more than 46 years, and we will ﬁ  nd a way to continue to do so.”

For one week, Gainesville resi-
dents will have the opportunity make a child’s holiday season with a simple shoe box.
Operation Christmas Child, an 
international gift-giving donation program hosted by Samaritan’s Purse, is holding its national week-long collection until Monday.
The Florida Santa Fe River area, 
which includes Gainesville, Jones-ville, Keystone Heights and Lake Butler, hopes to meet its goal of packing 13,000 boxes this year, said Denise Middleton, area coordinator.
“It’s an easy and fun way to love 
a child from far away,” she said.
Donors can bring shoe boxes 
ﬁ  lled with gifts or individual items to First Church of the Nazarene, 5020 NW 23rd Ave., from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.
Donors are asked to give hygiene 
products, school supplies, soft toys and other small gifts, said Christy Jones, the church relations coordi-nator for the Santa Fe River area of Samaritan’s Purse.
Sam Middleton, the co-coordina-tor for the area, said he believes his team will surpass the 12,910 boxes collected last year. After the ﬁ  rst day, he estimated the collection cen-ter had about 700 shoe boxes.
“This is the largest outreach to 
children in the world,” he added. “We help communities in the world come together.”

◗ THE SHOP OPENED LAST

Despite the competition, ULTA 
Beauty’s newest location is doing well after one month of business.
ULTA Beauty , a discount beauty 
supply store and salon, opened its 
second North Central Florida loca-tion when it expanded to Gainesville earlier this fall.
The nationwide chain has 39 lo-
cations across Florida, including one in Ocala. It opened shop at 6843 W. Newberry Road in the Oaks Square Shopping Center on Oct. 19.
“We’re very happy with the 
response that we’ve had so far,” said Keith Trotter, store manager. “More than anything, our custom-ers are happy to have an ULTA in the area.”
The shop aims to provide a space where people can get all of the ma-terials they need to feel beautiful, Trotter said. ULTA primarily sells makeup, skin care products and hair products.
While the store is near the Oaks 
Mall, it isn’t inside the mall.
“We like to stay out of malls be-
cause our business model is about convenience,” he said.
Gianna DiFrancesco, a 24-year-
old UF chemistry graduate student, said she was excited that ULTA had arrived in Gainesville.
She said the store is more afford-
able on a college student’s budget than Sephora, a beauty store that has a location inside The Oaks Mall.

The conﬂ  ict involving Israel and Hamas became more vio-
lent this week, killing more than 10 people so far in the Gaza area. Attacks utilized rockets and airstrikes; early on Thursday , the two ﬁ  ghting factions even resorted to using their Twitter accounts before the website suspended their use. We give an it’s-a-dangerous-world-out-there DART to the Middle East. It’s 
probably been done before, but everyone just calm down. We also realize it’s not that simple to stop a conﬂ  ict in the Middle East, but we can at least put it out there.
Why do people call where the president travels after a major 
storm a “recovery tour?” That sounds like when a celebrity gets out of rehab and goes on a lot of talk shows. Well, we digress. “We’re reminded that we are bound together and we have to look out for each other,” Obama said, in The New York Times. “The petty differences melt away.” We give an a-tour-could-also-be-the-kind-with-guitars-and-drums-and-stuff LAUREL 
to Obama. There’s no sense in blaming him for not personally 
rebuilding the Northeast; instead, let’s focus on a joint recovery effort.
Finally , something we can all celebrate! The ﬁ  nal release 
of the “Twilight” movie franchise! Just kidding. No one cares. What we’re actually going to miss the most is Robert Pattinson’s complete and utter distaste for whatever he got himself into. We give a whatever FLART to “Twilight.” Thank you for giving us

There are a number of things that are considered impolite 
to ask a lady . One of those is her weight (the answer is always “enough”) and another is her age.

That’s all for this week. Have a safe weekend, and go 
Gators!Labor rights should be valued and protected
The constitution of the International Labour Organiza-tion declares “universal and lasting peace can be estab-lished only if it is based upon social justice.”
In other words, our society can progress only when we 
push for equality, human rights, opportunity and sustain-ability . Considering most of us spend at least one-third of our lives at work, it only makes sense that we as a society should regard safety and health in the workplace as a basic human right to be unconditionally supported and protected. This support and protection is maintained by labor unions, who collectively bargain with employers on behalf of em-ployees for better workplace conditions, fair wages, health care coverage and other beneﬁ  ts that ensure workers are safe, comfortable and productive in an environment that upholds human dignity.
During the Progressive Era at the turn of the 20th century , 
unions like the American Federation of Labor pushed for broad reform in the workplace, particularly by preventing the courts from intervening in labor disputes through injunc-tions and yellow-dog contracts, which stipulate that employ-ees cannot unionize. 
Since then, we’ve had the Progressive Movement and la-
bor unions to thank for Social Security, employer-based health insurance, workplace safety regulations, child labor laws, sick leave, minimum wage, eight-hour work days, 40-hour work weeks, lunch breaks, weekends off, the right to strike, overtime pay , unemployment insurance, sexual harassment laws, workers’ compensation, the Family and Medical Leave Act and many other common sense standards, beneﬁ  ts and protections that nowadays are basic and expected.
On Wednesday , President Obama met with the heads of 
the nation’s most prominent labor unions and liberal think tanks to discuss the White House’s stance on upcoming ne-gotiations over the so-called ﬁ  scal cliff, the potentially disas-trous combination of sharp spending cuts and tax increases, which most economists claim will trigger another recession if not taken care of by the end of the year. After the meet-ing, labor leaders assured the press that President Obama is remaining ﬁ  rm in his position to only accept a deal with Re-publicans that includes an increase in tax rates for top earn-ers. According to Richard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO, “We are very, very committed to mak-ing sure that the middle class and workers don’t end up paying the tab for a party that we didn’t get to go to and the president is com-mitted to that as well.” 
Allowing the Bush tax cuts to 
expire for the richest 2 percent of 
households earning more than $250,000 establishes progres-sivity in our tax code, which is necessary to stimulate eco-nomic growth, pay down our ballooning budget deﬁ  cit and reduce income inequality. In turn, resources are freed up to ensure we can afford tax cuts for the middle class and vital investments in education, infrastructure development, re-search, health care, clean energy and other public services. 
You don’t necessarily need to look to history to see how 
important workers’ rights are. If you saw the mob of people marching down University Avenue on Tuesday afternoon, or read the front page of yesterday’s Alligator, then you’re aware of the rally Graduate Assistants United held to protest increasing GA fees and call for a minimum wage increase, health insurance, family/medical leave and child care.
As a graduate teaching assistant in the Warrington Col-
lege of Business Administration, I am a proud member of GAU. Also, I participated in both the march and the bargain-ing meeting, during which many GAs delivered moving testimonials about their daily struggles balancing graduate school, work, teaching, research and families on what is, in some cases, wages below poverty level.
Since graduate assistants are responsible for more than 
half of all teaching and research at the university, GAU and its supporters believe they should be guaranteed fair wages and stipends, relief from fees and basic insurance coverage.  
This is social justice. If we want to expect a workplace that 
is fair, healthy , productive and safe, we need to value labor rights as human rights. Support unions!

A movement started. 
There are petitions to the White 
House from people of more than 30 
states asking for peaceful secession from the 
United States of America to form a “NEW government.”
These petitions, starting with a petition 
for Louisiana’s secession from the Union, are not endorsed by the governments of their re-spective states. They are written by citizens through the White House website.
The petitions are ﬁ  lled with inspiring 
quotes from the Declaration of Indepen-dence and patriots such as Benjamin Frank-lin. All of these petitions seem to say the same thing: We, the people, want freedom.
This may sound good to many, but I 
would ask you to consider the possibility that there exists a better system of govern-ment.
Consider this: On Tuesday, one brave 
citizen called for truly radical change. There is now a petition to make comedian Duncan Trussell the emperor of Earth. The petition appeals to the Obama administration to “construct an iron throne made of meteor-ites” and other less-than-savory items upon which the emperor can hold dominion over the planet.
Just kidding.But this just goes to show what it takes to 
place a petition on the White House website. The petition area of the website is headlined “We the People: Your Voice in Our Govern-ment,” and just about any citizen can put anything they want up for petition.
I encourage readers to read the secession 
petitions. Many of them are rife with gram-matical errors.
I surely have my problems with the ever-
growing federal government, but if this is the face of what is to replace it, then I won’t sign.
I would also sincerely like to know where 
all of these people were when the younger Bush held the presidential ofﬁ  ce. It is my strong suspicion, given the high percentage of petitions on behalf of red states, that these people are only calling for secession now be-cause Obama won the election.
Nearly all of the domestic issues handled 
on the federal level that one could complain about were started under Bush, I would ar-gue. Why didn’t they petition when he was in ofﬁ  ce? Was it merely because of his politi-cal party?
Also, I am surprised that some of these 
petitions complain only of domestic policies. Policies such as the indeﬁ  nite detainment of citizens without trial are worthy of protest, but isn’t foreign policy equally worthy of mention?
To be very concerned with foreign policy 
isn’t nitpicky, as I’ve been told it is. Looking at our defense budget alone, we spend more than any country in the world by far. Since 9/11, we have spent trillions of dollars on wars.
If one is concerned with the national debt, 
as some of these petitioners are, I would think that foreign policy would be very im-portant.
More than for money, though, perhaps 
there are good moral reasons to take foreign policy into great consideration.
Since we invaded Iraq, there have been 
more than 100,000 deaths, mostly civilians. Just imagine that for a little. If it helps, imag-ine the faces of your own countrymen, peo-ple you know right here.
Now imagine the hundreds of innocent n o n c o m b a t a n t s who died in Paki-stan from drone strikes. Imag-ine the little girl crouched over the bloody corpse of her mother. Imag-ine the weeping father picking up the limp body of 
his dying son.
How could anyone think that to consider 
such things is to nitpick?
Are these petitioners the same people 
who were beating the war drum before we invaded Iraq? Are these petitioners the same people who are already beating the war drum again for Iran? I would hope not.
These petitions seem less than desirable 
for many reasons. I would encourage those who want to make a change for the better to read up on the histories of the issues and to take a course in English grammar.

To question the theory of what “normal” 
looks like, students gathered on the Plaza of 
the Americas to do something most students enjoy: dancing.
About 40 UF students and Gainesville resi-
dents participated in the Queer Sadie Hawk-ins Dance on Thursday afternoon, put on by OwnUp, a developing LGBTQ-straight alli-ance student organization.
Students danced in front of the “Whisper -
ing Close” statue, which displays a heterosex-ual couple dancing.
The goal was not to protest the statue, said 
OwnUp Co-Founder Eleni Angelopoulos. It was to raise awareness about heteronormativ-ity, a cultural bias that portrays heterosexuali-ty as normal and homosexuality as abnormal.
“There’s no representation of homosexual 
couples on campus,” she said, gesturing to the sculpture.
OwnUp aims to start a conversation about 
LGBTQ community representation at UF, An-gelopoulos said. “We’re bringing awareness to ask questions so people know what heteronor -
mativity is, act now and make an all-inclusive campus,” she said.The crowd started moving as a remix of 
Florence and the Machine’s “Shake It Out” blared from a stereo. People danced with their dates, whom they asked on the Face-book event’s wall, and a nearby display board asked, “What is normal?” 
Participants wrote answers to the question: 
“An evolution in societal thinking.” “Queer sex.” “Love.”
OwnUp co-founder and English junior Pat-
rick Runfeldt, 20, emphasized the dance was an image event, which aims to “get people looking” and to communicate the motive.
Students walking by stopped to see what 
was going on, took pictures with their phones and even joined in the dancing. Brittany Bruce, another OwnUp founding member, said she was excited to see students taking notice.
“Hopefully, it gets on Facebook or Insta-
gram and goes viral,” the 22-year-old business senior said.
After the music stopped, people talked, 
hugged and took pictures. Angelopoulos smiled and fanned herself despite the damp cold that clung to campus.
“The point of this event was to start dis-
cussion,” the 21-year-old English senior said, “and I think we’re doing that right now.”

It took a trip to UF’s infirmary 
for Christopher Joyce to find out 
he had been shot.
Now, almost four months af-
ter a hollow-point bullet pierced his apartment wall and hit him in the leg, the 21-year-old econom-ics junior is taking action.
On Tuesday, Joyce filed a law-
suit against the security guard whose gun discharged the bullet that hit him as he was sleeping in his 2nd Avenue Centre apart-ment in July.
Joyce is seeking about $15,000 
in damages from Jimmy L. Dixon, the security guard; One Global Security, Dixon’s secu-rity company; and American Campus Communities Services, which owns the apartment com-plex and hired Dixon.
On the night of the incident, 
Joyce woke up with a pain in his 
leg, Daniel Vazquez, Joyce’s at-torney, said Thursday.Joyce went to wash off the 
wound. When he returned, he noticed a small hole in his wall he described “like a rat had chewed through the wall.”
Thirty minutes later, Vazquez 
said, Dixon knocked on Joyce’s door, saying he heard a noise and wanted to make sure everything was all right. 
Vazquez is accusing Dixon of 
never admitting to Joyce that the bullet came from his gun.
“He was very evasive about 
what happened,” Vazquez said.
The next day , Joyce went 
to the infirmary, where doc-tors found metal shrapnel in his thigh. He then went to Shands at UF, where surgeons told him they could not remove the pieces, Vazquez said.
“The risk of taking out the 
fragments, because of the close proximity to vital arteries in the leg, was too high,” he said. “He could bleed out during the sur -
gery.”

Between the heat, early wake-up times and lack 
of time to tailgate, Joe Stubits said he hates when the 
Gators kick off at noon.
Noon games cause tailgaters to start earlier, require 
workers to arrive at the stadium sooner and force fans to attend the games during the hottest part of the day.
Stubits, a 20-year-old UF industrial and systems en-
gineering junior, said he is less likely to attend a game at noon than a later game.
Daniel Apple, assistant communications director 
of the UF Athletic Association, said the games’ kickoff times are set by CBS and ESPN, who hold exclusive rights to Southeastern Conference games. 
CBS holds exclusive rights to 3:30 p.m. kickoffs for 
the SEC Game of the Week. CBS also holds an exclu-sive window from 3:30 p.m. to 7 p.m., where no other network can broadcast an SEC game. The attendance numbers listed on gatorzone.com show no correlation between attendance and kickoff times.
ESPN gets the night kickoffs for SEC games after 
CBS gets their choice of the game of the week. ESPN also gives an option to schools for a pay-per-view game of their choice.
There have already been three noon games this sea-
son. With Saturday’s pay-per-view game against Jack-sonville State set for 1 p.m., the UF football team will not have a night game this season.
And that doesn’t bother Desheba Rutledge.Rutledge, a concession stand worker at Ben Hill 
Griffin Stadium, said she prefers noon games because she gets to go home earlier. 
She said she believes more students than normal 
ask for free cups of ice during noon games.
Ice or no ice, Stubits is not pleased.“I was very angry when I looked at the times and 
was like, ‘Wow, 12:30, awesome!’” he said. “This sucks. I’m going to die of heat.”
Stubits said he likes sleeping in, especially on Satur -
days, but noon games don’t allow for that.
“I just kinda go, ‘Oh crap,’ throw some clothes on, 
brush my teeth and run over to the game,” he said. “Preparation is very lacking.”Not all Gators are fans of noon gamesQueer Sadie Hawkins Dance opens dialogue about sexuality
The student rally was not meant to be Israel versus Palestine
Above heads, signs read “NO to HAMAS, 
YES to PEACE” and “Pro Peace.” The crowd 
sang Jewish prayers and chanted, “It’s great to be a Jewish Gator.”
Across the plaza, a smaller group bran-
dished a Palestinian flag. UF Students for a Democratic Society lead organizer Skye Schmelzer, a 20-year-old history junior, said they were there to counter-protest in sup-port of Palestine.
Kahn said the event was not meant to be 
Israel versus Palestine.
“We are on the same side,” he said. “I am 
scared not only for the people of Israel but for the Palestinian people.”
Shajar Epsztein, a 24-year-old law stu-
dent, came to attend UF from Israel in Au-gust. She described how alarms would go off before rockets hit and said her family has had less than a minute to find shelter before impact. 
Epsztein said she was happy to see so 
many UF students at the rally supporting Israel.
“It warms my heart,” she said.Rabbi Berl Goldman, co-director of the 
Lubavitch-Chabad Jewish Student and Com-munity Center, said he was pleased with the turnout.
“The entire Jewish community is con-
cerned,” he said. “We feel for them, we pray for them, we stand with them.”
Kahn said no matter which nation people 
are from or agree with, everyone needs to stand up against terrorism.
“It should be viva Palestine, viva Israel, 
viva peace, viva human rights,” he said.

The Ronald McDonald House of Gainesville 
has eight staff members who run the house 
that operates 24 hours a day , seven days a week, 365 days a year.Eight staff members for a house that never 
closes.
In the month of October, more rooms were 
full in the Ronald McDonald House than in the previous October, and staff members said they believe volunteers from community and UF organizations helped make that possible.The Ronald McDonald House provides a 
temporary home for family members of chil-dren receiving treatment at Shands at UF.
In October 2011, 88 percent of the house 
was occupied, and the annual average occu-pancy rate for the house is 93 percent. This October, the occupancy was at 95 percent, said executive director Melissa Tyrone.
She said the occupancy rate for each month 
is calculated by dividing the amount of rooms occupied by the amount of rooms available. There are 31 rooms in the house.
“One of the main things that makes our 
occupancy so high is that we’re able to turn rooms over quickly,” Tyrone said.
There are five to 10 families always on the 
waiting list in a busy month like October, she said, and the goal is to shorten the time it takes to clean rooms to a couple of hours. There is only one full-time housekeeper and one part-time housekeeper.
“We rely heavily on volunteers to do our 
light housekeeping,” said volunteer coordina-tor Dorie Faulkner.
One day last month, she said, there were 
four rooms that opened up at the same time. If there hadn’t been volunteers at the house that day to help clean up, the house would have been forced to turn people away.
Judy Bates coordinates the visiting chef 
program that schedules organizations to cook dinner for families staying in the house. A group-cooked dinner was provided every night last month, Faulkner said, and sorority sisters from the UF chapter of Alpha Delta Pi did twice.
“It means so much to families to be able 
to come home to a home-cooked meal,” she said.
The families usually eat the meals and go 
right back to the hospital.
“If it weren’t for that program, they’d prob-ably be living off vending machines,” Faulkner said.
In addition, October was dedicated to re-
painting and redecorating the house for its 30th anniversary and preparing it for the next 30 years, Tyrone said. The anniversary was July 8, but she said she talks about the history of the house at every event.
“We’re really celebrating the occasion 
throughout this year,” she said. “We’re giving ourselves a facelift for the 30th year.”
Some new furniture, including a couch de-
livered a few weeks ago, will help the house maintain its homey atmosphere, Tyrone said.
The UF Department of Recreational Sports 
brought about 30 people to do deep cleaning and help wash window screens.
“They were tremendous,” Faulkner said. 
“They really spruced the place up.”
A garden club decorated the indoor pa-
tio with a fall theme, and Faulkner said they transformed the space from an “ugly” place into a “serene” one.
Rotary Club of Gainesville members land-
scaped the west side of the house, completing their serenity garden and pond project. The Florida Youth ChalleNGe Academy in Starke came to the house Oct. 13 to plant and help fin-ish the Rotary project, which Faulkner said she thought cost about $40,000.
Other groups that volunteered during the 
busy month included UF’s Sigma Beta Rho Fraternity and the American Society of Inte-rior Designers.
Faulkner said the Gainesville location is 
one of the older houses in the country, and she said the anniversary attracts community proj-ects and exposure.
“It’s a very, very big deal,” she said.Faulkner said the proximity to UF is espe-
cially helpful for recruiting volunteers.
“We have the fortunate problem of having 
too many volunteers,” she said. “We have one of the happiest issues a nonprofit organization could have.”10, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 16, 2012

 After a shaky debut season 
with the Gators, Mike Rosario has 
ﬁ  nally given coach Billy Donovan a reason to cheer. 
  Against No. 22 Wisconsin and 
Alabama State in UF’s ﬁ  rst two games of the season, the redshirt senior guard averaged 14.5 points, three rebounds and three assists. No. 10 Florida won both contests by an average margin of 33.5 points.   “Going into both of these 
games, my preparation and my concentration has been to the top,” Rosario said.
  Before transferring to Florida, 
Rosario was Rutgers’ most de-pendable talent. In two seasons with the Scarlet Knights from 2008-10, he led the team with 16.4 points per game. 
  But Rosario disappointed last 
season, averaging only 6.6 points in 14.4 minutes per game. He missed six games in 2011-12 because of back, leg and hip injuries.
  Among Gators who took at 
least 98 threes, his 33.7 shooting percentage from behind the arc was the worst on the squad. 
  Rosario had difﬁ  culty accept-
ing that Florida didn’t need him to be the type of go-to scorer he was at Rutgers.
  Rosario’s lack of intensity land-
ed him in Donovan’s doghouse. 
  “Last year, he provided nothing 
for our team because he was never responsible, never accountable and wasn’t reliable,” Donovan said.
  But during the preseason, Don-
ovan saw an improvement in Ro-sario’s attitude and consistency.
  “I love dealing with him be-
cause it’s complete confrontation and it’s chaotic,” Donovan said. “He ﬁ  nally knows you’re not get-ting your way . That totally , last year, sent him into a tailspin.”
  With junior point guard Scot-
tie Wilbekin suspended for undis-closed reasons, Rosario has logged more minutes at shooting guard. Before Wilbekin’s suspension, the 6-foot-3 Rosario was playing as an undersized small forward. 
  Rosario struggled in Florida’s 
exhibition against Nebraska-Kear-ney and in one half against George-town but turned the corner against the Hornets and the Badgers.  
  In Florida’s 74-56 victory 
against Wisconsin on Wednesday night, Rosario recorded 15 points, four rebounds, four assists and four turnovers. 
  He played 39 minutes against 
the Badgers, 14 more than in any contest last year. 
  “I did a great job crashing the 
boards and getting my teammates shots,” Rosario said. “When you’re out there having fun, you like to embrace it.”
  Now more conﬁ  dent, Rosario 
will look to keep his momentum going when Florida (2-0) faces Middle Tennessee (2-0) on Sunday at 4 p.m. in the Tampa Bay Times Forum.
  “He’s bought in and trying to 
do all the things I’m asking him to do,” Donovan said. “Unlike a year ago, when you corrected him and he had all the answers and the so-lutions to everything — the world, politics, what’s going on, all the so-lutions — right now he’s actually listening.” 
   Senior Day at The Swamp has ar-
rived. Nineteen seniors will be honored before Florida takes on 
vaunted Jacksonville State. For those wondering, Jacksonville State is in Ala-bama. This will certainly turn into a classic the masses will be cluckin’ about for years to come. UF always seems to do well against non-BCS schools at home, right? 
  Tears will be shed as Florida’s se-
niors walk onto the ﬁ  eld for the ﬁ  nal time. The Gamecocks may also be do-ing a little bit of crying after this one is over. Are we the only ones who think chickens should stay as menu items like Chicken Parmesan rather than college football mascots?
                Now, onto the picks! 
  The Cardinal (+20.5) will force the 
Ducks back into their coop because…
  Stanford leads the nation in rushing 
defense, allowing just 58.6 yards per 
game. Take that, Ducks! Oregon ranks third in rushing offense with a stag-gering 325.1 yards per game. They’ve scored at least 42 points in every game this season. The highest-ranked defense Oregon has faced is Fresno State, now at No. 25. Stanford roughs up the Ducks on Saturday . 
  -ADAM PINCUS
The Ducks (-20.5) will make the 
Cardinal wish it wasn’t playing 1-on-11 because...
  Kenjon Barner is good at football. In 
the ﬁ  ve games leading up to last week, the senior running back averaged 177 rushing yards per game and 9.0 yards per carry . Last Saturday , he managed just 65 yards on 20 carries for an aver-age of 3.3 yards per rush. Still, Oregon beat Cal 59-17. The Great Barnburner will not be contained again, and if he somehow is, the rest of the Ducks will rise to the occasion. Quack! Quack!

Senior bouncing back after disappointing year 
  PHILLIP HEILMAN
 Alligator Writer
   
 Kayla Lewis made a layup with 8:15 re-
maining in the ﬁ  rst half to extend Florida’s 
lead to six on Thursday night.
  Unfortunately for UF, it did not make an-
other shot for more than six minutes.
  FSU (2-0) scored 28 of the next 30 points 
to ﬁ  nish the half and stormed past Florida (2-1) 98-67 in the Donald L. Tucker Center in Tallahassee. 
  “[The Seminoles] played like the team 
that they are — seniors with a couple of juniors,” coach Amanda Butler said. “We looked like all freshmen, unfortunately, with no upperclassmen.”
  The Gators led 
by as many as nine points in the ﬁ  rst half before a rash of turnovers and a sudden inability 
to make shots ﬂ  ipped the momentum to the Seminoles.   UF turned the ball over six times and missed six ﬁ  eld goal attempts during Florida State’s 28-2 run to end the ﬁ  rst half. 
  A transition layup by Jennifer George ac-counted for the only two ﬁ  rst-half points the Gators scored after Lewis’ layup.
  “We just didn’t have enough compo-
sure,” George said. “A  ll of a sudden they had a   push, and we didn’t react well to it.”
  Said Butler: “They just outplayed us for 
the rest of the ball game.”
  After halftime, the Gators couldn’t make 
a run to erase their daunting deﬁ  cit. 
  A pair of three-pointers by Leonor Rodri-
guez early in the second half extended FSU’s lead to 25, all but sealing the game.
  Rodriguez paced the Seminoles with a Florida doomed by Florida State’s monster run

In its two previous wins, Florida held opponents to 
an average of 57 points on 33.8 percent shooting. 
“The disappointing part of this was not who scored 
or who didn’t score,” Butler said. “We gave up 98 points, and that’s not just bad but embarrassing for a team that’s supposed to be hanging their hat on de-fense.”
Butler said the team’s main focus in practice this 
weekend will be on defense, which appeared scattered and disorganized for much of the second half. 
George again led the way for UF offensively, scor -
ing 20 points and grabbing nine rebounds. She was ac-tive early but unable to pick up the slack for the rest of her teammates, who couldn’t consistently get her the ball in the post during FSU’s decisive run.
“I thought she really battled in the paint,” Butler 
said. 
Overall, Butler was irritated with her team’s defi-
ciencies.
“All the way around it is something we have to 
learn from,” Butler said. “Obviously, we were very ex-posed.”16, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 16, 2012

Earl Okine’s career as a Gator hasn’t al-
ways been enjoyable.
Early on, he struggled to get on the field, 
and when he did, he didn’t perform well 
enough to earn extensive playing time.
As a native of Gainesville, the frustra-
tions were exacerbated. He constantly had to hear about his lack of production from those closest to him.
“There have been many times when I was 
just real down,” Okine said. “But that just comes with playing in your hometown.”
For those reasons, Saturday will be a 
special day for the redshirt senior defensive lineman, who has had his most productive season in his final go-round at Florida.
Okine will have more than 20 friends and 
family members in attendance when he and 18 other seniors are honored prior to their last game at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium. No. 7 Florida (9-1, 7-1 Southeastern Conference) hosts Jacksonville State (6-4, 5-3 Ohio Valley Conference) at 1 p.m. on Saturday.
A graduate of Gainesville High, Okine 
redshirted in 2008 before playing in five games in 2009. Entering 2012, he had record-ed just 15 tackles. 
He credits Will Muschamp and defensive 
coordinator Dan Quinn’s coaching for the strides he’s made over the past two seasons.“Dan Quinn is probably the best thing 
that has ever happened to me in my football career,” Okine said. “He’s just an excellent coach. I can’t say enough about him. He con-veys his message on his techniques very well — better than I’ve ever seen a coach do.”Through 10 games in 2012, Okine has 10 
tackles. He also blocked a critical field goal attempt in Florida’s 31-17 win at Vanderbilt on Oct. 13. Quinn said Okine made progress with his ability to shed blocks 
“No. 1 with him was him recognizing some of the blocks and seeing it,” Quinn said. “He has certainly worked hard at that and you can see him improving.”
Every current UF senior was a part of the 
2009 team that was undefeated before fall-ing to Alabama in the SEC Championship Game. Fifth-year seniors such as Okine, de-fensive tackle Omar Hunter and Buck line-backer Lerentee McCray were around for the 2008 national championship run.
The seniors have also experienced the 
other end of the spectrum, as Florida strug-gled through a five-loss season in 2010 and a six-loss campaign in 2011.
While the Gators won’t be in the confer-
ence title game this year, senior linebacker Jon Bostic said being a part of UF’s bounce-back season was most meaningful.
“I was here my freshman year and went 
to the SEC Championship, so I’ve kind of been here through the highs,” Bostic said. “Then, you know, sophomore, junior sea-son, just being able to turn everything back around and get everything back on track.”
Although Okine struggled early on, he 
does not regret the way his Florida career played out.
“I love this university,” Okine said. “And 
I wouldn’t have redone anything. I love this program, and it will always be a part of my life.”
Okine is content with his college career. 
He would not be distraught if he doesn’t make it to the NFL.
“If this is my last year playing football, 
that’s fine with me.”
