STAFF REPORT
In what will probably be remembered as 
the single most deﬁ  nitive move in Florida 
educational history, the University of Florida and Florida State University announced today that the two schools will be merging.
The name of the new super-university is 
yet to be determined, but has already been cited as a major source of contention between 
the two concerned parties. For the sake of 
clarity, the Alligator will henceforth be refer-ring to the new university as University of Florida Florida State University (UFFSU).
With many aspects of the schools’ futures 
up in the air, one thing is certain: the new location. The two schools will combine in the charming town of Perry, Florida, whose main attractions seem to be church-sponsored 
barbecues and breakfasts hosted by Christian 
motorcycling interest groups. Both schools’ campuses will then be converted to theme parks.
“With all these smart kids coming to town, 
maybe we’ll ﬁ  nally be able to boast a Wheel of Fortune champion!” said one Perry resi-dent excitedly.
When reached for comment, most UF stu-
dents had the same concern.
“So are we moving Balls there or what?” 
asked one UF junior.
Currently, there are no plans to move the 
entirety of Midtown to Perry, but a merger with popular Tallahasse scene “the Strip” is being considered, sources say.
With the quality of nightlife in Perry still 
questionable, other students were worried about academics.
“Um, don’t they know that we’re ranked 
the No. 1 school in the state?” asked one fraz-zled UF freshman. “And what on earth am I 
supposed to do with my #UF20 T-shirt?”
One group on campus particularly upset 
by the change are the UF Cicerones. One 
was seen pacing back and forth across Tur-lington and appeared to be muttering under his breath, “They expect me to just give tours without making potato and french-fry jokes? What else am I even supposed to say?”
To help ease the transition, the UF Coun-
seling and Wellness Center is currently of-fering extra counseling sessions for former UF students who may suffer trauma. Causes could include prolonged exposure to the War Chant or an overdose of garnet and gold.
One major draw to the move is the com-
bining of both of the schools’ vast resources. In fact, the merger will produce a campus that hosts a whopping eight Starbucks locations.
“Maybe I’ll ﬁ  nally be able to get a freaking 
breakfast sandwich,” grumbled one UF biolo-
gy junior stomping out of the Marston Science 
Library Starbucks, which had just run out — although the Alligator is currently conducting an investigation as to whether they ever had any pastries in stock at all.
UF President Fuchs and FSU President  
John Thrasher both acknowledge the difﬁ  -culties in forging ahead with a merger of two schools so deeply set in their rivalrous ways. 
However, both say they are “look(ing) for-
ward to a bright future for higher education in Florida,” according to a release from the universities.
With such a positive outlook on the future 
of the brand-new University of Florida Florida State University, the presidents are sure to work together and make the university the best it can be.

Here is a proposed rendering of a plaza where UF and FSU students will mingle on their way to classes. The new school will be locat-
ed in Perry, Florida.  It could be called UFFSU, pronounced “you-FOO-zoo” or FSUUF pronounced “fah-ZOOF. ” It’s still being debated.
‘Noles and Gators now one nation
UF and FSU to merge schoolsSPORTS
STAFF REPORT
 
With the recent merging of Florida and 
Florida State into one university, one aspect of both schools remains in question: the sports programs.
 UF President Kent Fuchs and FSU Presi-
dent John Thrasher announced Friday that the two schools would be combining cam-puses and academic facilities, but failed to mention what would become of the athletic departments. Speciﬁ  cally, no mention was made regarding the only sport anyone really cares about: football.
 As a result, there is only one possible, 
responsible inference to be made by those of us at the Alligator: football at both schools is being disbanded. Why? The answer is simple. The sole purpose of both programs was to hate each other. Now, with the two universities merging, there is no reason for the two teams to exist.
 “I mean, we could just play football 
against other schools,” an unnamed UF 
football player told the Alligator.
 But with no acknowledgement of the 
disbandment of the football programs from 
either university’s athletic departments, fans and students alike are left to wonder what is to become of their Saturday after-noons in the fall.
 “I don’t know. I guess I’ll just watch TV 
or something,” one UF student said. “I hear 
UCF is gonna be good this year.”UF football

A UF team competed nationally 
and won the people’s choice award 
for its gun-safety device Thursday night.
Three UF students and one stu-
dent from the Georgia Institute of Technology competed in the inno-vation category at Microsoft’s 2016 U.S. Imagine Cup competition in San Francisco. Their design, Gun Loc, can be the size of a Cheez-It and sticks to a gun. It allows the gun’s owner to track its location and know whether it’s been ﬁ  red.
The four came up with the idea 
while traveling to the University of Illinois’ hack-athon, HackIllinois, in February. The team made a software program within 36 hours, said Ber-nard Marger, a UF computer engi-neering senior.
During the competition, the team 
created the app to track a gun and won third place overall, the 21-year-old said.
The team’s device measures the 
vibrations and movement made when a gun is picked up, he said.
The team also won ﬁ  rst place in 
Microsoft’s category for using Azure, a Microsoft online cloud computer storage and backup program, said Jean-Ralph Aviles, a UF computer engineering senior.
A few weeks after HackIllinois, 
the team’s members got an email from Microsoft urging them to apply to the company’s 2016 U.S. Imagine 
Cup competition, the 22-year-old 
said.
“We weren’t expecting much, 
but we got the email from the Micro-soft recruiter and entered our prod-uct in,” he said, “Now we’re in San Francisco.”
Marger said his team created Gun 
Loc to let gun owners know where 
their guns are at all times.
“Basically, this is bringing us closer to protected ﬁ  rearms,” he 
said.
This is the ﬁ  rst time a UF team 
has made it to the national competi-tion, he said. This team was also the only one at the competition to have a member from another school.
Faizan Virani, a Georgia Tech 
computer science sophomore, decid-
ed to join Marger’s team during the 
18-hour trip to Illinois.  
“It’s amazing that by meeting 
(Marger) in one hack-athon led to this,” the 19-year-old said.
Troy Gittelmacher, a UF comput-
er engineering senior, said the expe-rience has been surreal.
“Making a project in 36 hours at 
a hack-athon has turned into this,” the 21-year-old said.  “It’s been an eye-opening experience on how the demand for new ideas is growing.”
Marger said a Gainesville gun 
distributor has contacted the team’s members about selling the software, but they haven’t decided yet wheth-er they want to sell it.
“I was not expecting that, but 
that is a wide-open door if we want to do that,” he said. FRIDAY, APRIL 1, 2016   ALLIGATOR   3

Alligator Staff Writer 
The lost boys of the Arthur G. 
Dozier School for Boys can ﬁ  nally go home. 
On Wednesday, Gov. Rick Scott 
signed into law a bill that acknowl-
edges the abuse and deaths of boys 
at the North Florida reform school in Marianna, Florida.
Sen. Arthenia Joyner, D-Tampa, 
introduced Senate Bill 708 in No-vember. On March 15, it was pre-sented to Scott, who signed it 15 days later. The bill sets aside a total of $500,000 for families to properly 
bury the identiﬁ  ed bodies of chil-
dren. Each family will receive up to $7,500 for burial and funeral ar-rangements.
Bryant Middleton, 70, a 
Gainesville resident and former Dozier student, said the bill proves the horrors of the abuse he and for-mer students suffered.
“This is the very ﬁ  rst step in ob-
taining full justice across the board for every child that was beaten and brutalized,” Middleton said.
The Florida Legislature can de-
cide to repeal the legislation, UF professor Darren Hutchinson wrote in an email, but he doesn’t believe they will. 
Hutchinson said the bill doesn’t 
mean Florida admits any wrongdo-ing, nor does it require students’ families to receive compensation for alleged grievances.
“Unexplained and suspicious 
deaths, incidents of sexual assault, and mass incarceration are ongo-ing problems that Floridians need to address and solve,” Hutchinson 
said.

Students said they felt mixed 
emotions after the Snapchat app 
announced efforts to improve communication Tuesday.
Chat 2.0 incorporated new 
features that mimic “face-to-face conversation,” allowing users to switch between video chatting, texting and calling, the company announced.
Monica Huynh, a 19-year-old 
UF biology sophomore, said the updates can be overwhelming.
“Sometimes I think it’s best to keep things simple,” she said. “I liked Snapchat because it didn’t have the millions of features that other messaging apps have; now 
it’s kind of annoying.”
Snapchat also introduced Au-
to-Advance Stories, changing the 
way users view a 24-hour feed of photographs and videos posted by fellow users. 
Stories now transition seam-
lessly from one user to the next, whereas Snapchatters previously 
had to click individual friends to 
view their stories.
Along with the free features, 
Snapchat now charges users for the ability to replay a Snap. As of press time, Snapchatters can purchase three Replays for 99 cents, 10 Replays for $2.99, and 
20 replays for $4.99.
Endy Morales, a 21-year-old 
UF criminology senior, said he 
enjoys the more than 200 stick-ers — including walruses, sloths, aliens and Snapchat’s signature ghost — included in the updates.
“I love the new sloth emojis,” 
Morales said. “But I wish there 
was a way to turn off autoplay; 
I liked choosing whose stories I watched.”THE THREE NEW  
BOARD MEMBERS WILL BE 
APPOINTED IN JUNE.
By Meryl Kornfield
Alligator Staff Writer
UF’s Board of Trustees will have 
three new members in June.
UF announced Thursday that Gov. 
Rick Scott appointed Morteza Hosseini, 
a land developer, to succeed Christo-pher Corr. 
The Florida Board of Governors also 
appointed Marsha Powers and Leonard Johnson to UF’s 13-member board.
The new members will serve until 
2019, wrote UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes in an email. 
Board of Trustees members are not 
paid for their service.
Members are staggered with five-
year terms, she said.
Powers, the chief executive officer 
of Tenet Healthcare’s Florida Region, will succeed Charles Edwards. Johnson, a Tampa Bay-area attor-
ney, will replace Susan Cameron. 
Both Powers and Johnson attended 
UF.
“The individuals who serve on the 
board come from a variety of back-grounds and professions and each 
brings a unique set of skills and experi-
ences to the table,” Sikes said.
Susan Webster, a UF international 
studies senior and Student Body presi-dent-elect, will replace current Student 
Body President Joselin Padron-Rasines 
on the board. 
Webster said she looks forward to 
discussing education policies on the 
board next term.
“I think that every member has a 
passion for not only the University of 
Florida, but also for making UF a top-10 university,” the 22-year old said.

A mile of University Avenue 
will close Sunday from 11 a.m. to 
3 p.m. as thousands of residents visit the fourth-annual Active Streets Gainesville.
Organizers expect up to 10,000 
visitors throughout the event, which includes interactive booths from lo-cal businesses and organizations, 
said Kathryn Horter, a Gainesville 
Street Alliance committee member.
The mile between West Sixth 
Street and Northeast Boulevard will be closed, according to an event flyer.
“It is free for vendors to sign up, 
and they are expected to provide 
free, fun activities,” Horter said.
Joseph Floyd, the executive di-
rector of the Active Streets Alliance, 
originally requested funding from the Florida Department of Transpor-tation to bring the “ciclovias” to life.
“These ciclovias include a clos-
ing of a public pathway of certain streets, a practice sometimes called ‘open streets,’” he said.
Floyd said Active Streets 
Gainesville is the only Florida ciclo-via organized solely by citizens and funded by the FDOT and the city — all while attracting more visitors.
This year, organizers added a 
bike valet, where guests can park their ride while visiting the main event or a concert taking place on Bo Diddley Plaza afterward.
Horter said the free event brings 
together locals who may never meet in everyday circumstances.
“The event is designed to high-
light and build community,” she 
said. “There is no headliner or main 
event because we all meet in the street as equals.”

A new conference aims to empower UF women to 
be themselves.
From Bossy to Boss Women’s Leadership Confer-
ence will start Saturday at 9:30 a.m. at Pugh Hall. 
Members of Women’s Mentorship and Advoca-
cy Program wanted to inspire women of all back-
grounds to be confident in who they are.
The conference will allow UF students to network 
and understand their strengths, Caitlin Bletscher, a co-coordinator of the event, said. 
The theme shows how women can be assertive 
without being overbearing.
After three keynote speakers talk about empow-
ering others, networking and leadership skills, par-ticipants will discuss the talks, the UF agricultural education and communication doctoral student said.
Bletscher, 29, got the idea for the conference dur-
ing the summer, she said.  
At the conference, she said she wants partici-
pants to collaborate with each other. 
Men are also welcome to attend.
Corina McBride, a UF natural resource conserva-
tion sophomore, said she helped plan the conference 
and will attend this weekend. 
“I’d love to leave with a sense of empowerment, 
whether it be through myself or through others,” the 19-year-old said. 
She said she hopes to make other attendees feel 
strong and confident when they enter the workplace. 
“I’m really excited to reach out to the local com-
munity and connect with girls and give them an in-sight in how successful their future can be,” Mc-Bride said.  Bossy to Boss:

UF dancers are collecting canned 
food to help families with sick chil-
dren.
Extreme Dance Company will have 
collection boxes in the lobby of the Phillips Center for the Performing Arts at its semesterly Spring showcase, We 
Run The World, on Sunday. The non-
perishable food will go to Ronald Mc-Donald House Charities of North Cen-tral Florida, Rachel Keyt, a company costume chair, said.Members of the company decided 
to collect food in place of charging ad-
mission to give back to the communi-
ty, the UF animal sciences sophomore said.
The group picked Ronald McDon-
ald House because it is partnered with UF Health Shands Children’s Hospi-tal, she said. Ronald McDonald House helps families stay together while their children are in the hospital.
The group doesn’t have a goal to 
reach, Keyt, 19, said. They want to help as many as they can.
“It’s a simple thing, but it can have a really big impact,” she said.
This semester’s show is based off 
Beyoncé’s song “Run the World,” which promotes feminine power, Keyt 
said. All of the songs in the show are 
sung by artists who are women.
Drew Chodash, a UF marketing 
freshman, said she’s glad to help the 
Gainesville community through dance. 
She said she hopes students come out and donate.
“I think donating cans to the Ron-
ald McDonald House is a really great 
idea to give back to the community in 
a fun way — by donating a can instead of paying an entry fee to the show,” 19-year-old said.  UF dancers collect food for familiesTHERE IS A CHILI COOK-OFF

Alachua County will celebrate nature with pots of chili 
and a roster of activities Saturday. 
The annual O’Leno Ole’ Chili Cook-Off is scheduled from 
9 a.m. to 3 p.m. at O’Leno State Park, located at 410 SE 
O’Leno Park Road in High Springs, Florida. 
A Springs Celebration is scheduled from 11 a.m. to 3 
p.m. at the same location, and admission to both events is 
free with the donation of a canned food item. 
“It is a celebration to get people out in nature,” said Sta-
cie Greco, the water conservation coordinator for the Ala-chua County Environmental Protection Department.
About 30 people usually sign up to compete in the cook-
off, and guests can sample the entries with a $5 tasting kit, 
said Harriet Walsh, the event coordinator.
“These people get kind of crazy sometimes,” she said. 
“They will dress up or decorate their canopy.”
Greco said the band Weeds of Eden will perform a va-riety of musical genres, and local artists will display their work. 
She said visitors often enjoy the Springs Water Chal-
lenge, which shows participants how much water they use on a daily basis. 
Unlike last year, Greco said, the Water Ventures interac-
tive display won’t be present. 
When the tractor-trailer visited last week, planners real-
ized it didn’t ﬁ  t in the park. 
Proceeds from the event, which include money gathered 
from a rafﬂ  e for canoe trips, will go toward The Friends of O’Leno, a nonproﬁ  t organization that supports the park, ac-cording to a press release. 
Along with a tour that spans about 1.5 miles of the Santa 
Fe River, Saturday’s events include several other activities to put visitors in touch with nature, Greco said.

Column
A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, or so it seems, 
we students returned from Spring Break and told ourselves 
“we have plenty of time” until the end of the semester. 
Oh, where does the time go? We’re now on a countdown 
to the last day of classes, April 20, with only two and a half weeks left till liftoff. 
And as the tidal wave of deadlines and all-nighters rap-
idly approaches, we extend to you our helping hand of wit, this lighthouse of cheesy, dad-approved ramblings, our lat-est segment of…
Darts & Laurels
Thursday’s editorial may have partly served as a “Marry 
me, I love you!” from our opinions editor to Trevor Noah (Oh, David…), but one point he failed to address was 
how great the comedian who opened for Trevor Noah was 
Wednesday night. 
New York comedian Angelo Lozada warmed the crowd 
up at the Accent Speakers Bureau event by crowd-pleasing 
— which is generally frowned upon in comedy, but we at 
the Alligator feel he did so tastefully.
At the very least he gave us all a cheeky perspective on 
the Science, Technology, Engineering and Math fields we often take so seriously and officially. When he called upon 
an audience member who was a materials science and engi-
neering student, Lozada responded with, “Materials? Four years for that? I can do that,” looked at his onstage wooden stool and shouted, “Wood!” So we give a laurel to Angelo 
Lozada; thanks for the memories, sir.
In other breaking news this week: “Finding Dory.” On 
Thursday, a list of new characters to be featured in the film 
was released, and it includes Dory’s parents, a collection of adorable otters and a duo of sea lions, played by none other 
than Dominic West and Idris Elba of HBO’s “The Wire.” 
Longtime fans of this hit series will now get their re-
union of two of the show’s most beloved actors, and this 
time they’re teaming up with the rest of the “Nemo” crew. 
We give a laurel to the amazing cast and much-antic-
ipated film to hit theaters June 17. However, we must also give out a preemptive dart… to the army of little kids likely to storm theaters for this film.
Don’t get us wrong, this splendid movie should be expe-
rienced and appreciated by all, but let there be no mistake that this movie first and foremost belongs to us: millenni-als, young adults, people in their 20s who refuse to grow up. 
It was us who endured the perilous venture and anxiety 
of losing, but then finally finding, Nemo back in 2003. 
Now, after 13 years of silently murmuring “just keep 
swimming” in our sleep, this movie’s ours. So to all the youngsters out there, we’ll happily share the laughter and 
experience of “Finding Dory” with you; just let us cut you 
in line.
Lastly, in political news, the Arizona election fraud 
hearing was held Monday; the word “intense” doesn’t 
even come close to describing it. 
While Maricopa County Recorder Helen Purcell was 
apologetic at the meeting and vaguely assured further in-
ternal investigations would take place, outraged citizens called for a revote and Purcell’s resignation. We give a dart 
to this entire situation and trust Arizona officials will, at 
least, organize a revote. All votes deserve to be accurately represented: This is simply what democracy means.The most unhealthy love triangle of 2016
When asked on “Meet the Press“ if he 
would consider being another can-didate’s running mate, Ohio gover-nor and presidential hopeful John Kasich answered, “No! Under no 
circumstances…You pundits got to get out of Washington. You don’t understand me.”
The purpose of Kasich’s rebuke was to 
make clear to voters he would not be so cyni-cal as to compromise the integrity of his mes-sage for a comfortable position as a so-called Washington insider. He would rise above the pettiness and punditry of Washington politics, break the seven years of partisan gridlock only made worse by polarizing 
news media, and bring real change to a city and a nation 
beholden to special-interest groups as well as lobbying organizations.  
However, asking about Kasich’s potential to run as 
vice president is appropriate; the governor has no ob-vious path to the Republican Party nomination, except through the ambiguous mechanisms of a brokered con-vention. In the immediate future, Kasich’s most likely career in Washington would be under the administration 
of another GOP candidate.
In some form or another, the notion of tackling the 
seemingly corrupt politics of our nation’s capital is 
the only bipartisan and universal message of the 2016 presidential election. Each candidate markets himself or herself as the man or woman who can properly wade through the intrinsically sinister apparatus that just hap-pens to be the 200-year-old American democratic system.
In American politics, this isn’t a new strategy. Rarely 
does a presidential candidate overtly promise to main-tain the status quo in order to get elected. I think the last time was during the 1916 election of Woodrow Wilson. Americans adore revolutions — and at least like change — and won’t vote for a candidate who promises any-thing less.
But what is perhaps most unusual about the cur-
rent election cycle is the level of animosity between the candidates, the news media and the public. Tension between political parties has long been brewing — the inanity of the Clinton im-peachment scandal may well have been the ﬁ  rst warning sign of an increasingly dramatic 
political polarization. The only possible con-
clusion to 24/7 cable news had to be at least a few hours of unscripted, unthoughtful sem-blances of dialogue. And what happens when these two trends converge? The front-runner of a major U.S. political party defends the size 
of his penis during a nationally televised debate.
Nevertheless, this election cycle is unusual. Under-
standable given the trajectory of discourse, but unusual 
nonetheless. What has emerged is an escalating three-
way ground war of mistrust among all members of the political process: the leaders, the media and the voters. More politicians and members of the press must vilify one another in order to gain credibility with the pub-lic. The public is more frequently led by the press to believe politicians are untrustworthy; the public listens. The public is more frequently told by politicians that the press is untrustworthy; the public listens.
This paradox isn’t much of a problem in and of itself. 
Politicians can be replaced; certain members of the press do not need to be heeded. But what happens when poli-tics and journalism itself are at fault? When the process of compromise to achieve common goals or the inves-tigation of truth through carefully measured skepticism is in question on, frankly, both sides of the aisle? When discourse like what Americans have been seeing contin-ues to ramify, what other conclusions are the public to 
draw?
But my readers, to cite a particularly memorable quote 
from a presidential debate from Mr. Donald Trump, “I as-
sure you, there’s no problem.” The American system of government isn’t about to tear itself apart, but it certain-ly seems ever more comfortable with self-cannibalism.

Lifeless Joey: A Tribute to the Folks Who Made Us FunnyBy Katelyn Newberg
Alligator Staff Writer
Lina Colondres hasn’t slept 
through the night in four years.
Instead of sleeping, she goes 
into her small living room and 
types her life story onto her cell-phone.
She writes about her husband, 
Ruben Flores Garcia, who was de-ported to Mexico about four years ago.
Last month, Colondres reached 
out to UF’s Hispanic-Latino Affairs 
about events for the Gainesville 
community. She never thought she’d find help getting her hus-band back with a group of UF stu-
dents. After talking to the program 
coordinator, the group set out to help her raise $1,000 for legal fees.
During the first Cesar Chavez 
Memorial Day of Service on Thurs-
day, the HLA and Hispanic Stu-
dent Association announced they raised about $350 for Colondres.
But Colondres said there’s no 
guarantee her husband will return.
“I miss the pillow talks. I miss 
the fights,” the 44-year-old said. “I just miss everything.”
•   •   •
Before he was arrested, Ruben 
Flores Garcia was the sole pro-vider for his family. He made $500 
a week at a chicken plant in Ala-
bama.
Flores Garcia was arrested at 
the plant March 26, 2012.
Evan George, Colondres’ law-
yer, said Flores Garcias’ deporta-tion is the result of attorney mal-practice.
He said their previous immi-
gration lawyer, Jasmin Miller, gave the family bad legal advice and didn’t tell them when Flores was in danger of being deported. 
Because of Miller, Flores Garcia 
never saw his day in court.
“It’s just a classic example of 
what’s wrong with the system,” George said. “It boils my blood.”
He’s now helping her get her 
husband back for free, he said. He couldn’t say no.
“It’s the right thing to do,” he 
said. “There’s no way they could do this on their own.”
•   •   •
Marcelo Flores Colondres 
turned 3 years old when his father was deported.
Now 7, he has grown up with 
anger-management issues, Lina Colondres said. Her other son, 8-year-old Ruben Flores Colondres 
Jr., misses his father every time he 
earns an award at school.
Ruben has trouble eating. Both 
wake up in the middle of the night screaming.
“They think, ‘My dad don’t 
love me, my dad don’t care,’” said Lina Colondres. “And I’m trying to explain to them it’s not him; it’s 
the government.”•   •   •
Colondres said she survives by 
the grace of God.
After her husband was deport-
ed, she moved back to Gainesville 
with their three children.
Every month, she receives a 
$500 disability check and $200 in 
food stamps from the government, 
she said. Because of dislocated disks in her spine, she can’t stand longer than five minutes. Diabetes 
is slowly taking her eyesight. Un-
able to work, government assis-tance is her only income.
Despite struggling to clothe her 
sons, she still manages to place an international call to her husband once a week.
“I am barely making it. I am to 
the point where I cry every single night,” she said. “I don’t know what’s going to happen tomorrow; 
I don’t know if I’m going to feed 
my kids tomorrow.”
•   •   •
Colondres decided to take mat-
ters into her own hands about two months ago.
She said she started a GoFund-
Me page and raised about $400 on her own. After talking to Diana 
Moreno, the program coordinator 
of the HLA, the organization put boxes in the Reitz Union and La Casita to collect money.
“We believe in connecting our 
students to community members,” said Moreno, who was once un-documented. “The reality of fam-ily separation is very close to our 
hearts.”
As of press time, her GoFund-
Me page has raised $777, includ-
ing donations from the HLA and HSA fundraiser.
Michael Reyes, a UF history 
sophomore, said he donated $5 to Colondres.
“Anything counts,” he said. “I 
understand it’s tough for people.”
He said he knew what Colon-
dres and her children were going through. Growing up, his parents were undocumented, and as a 
single child, he feared for what 
would happen to him if his family was deported.
“There’s always that fear of be-
ing separated from your family,” the 20-year-old said.
Colondres said she was excited 
to see the students who donated money Thursday, but she wished 
her husband could see them, too.
“I think my sadness takes over, 
and I wish he was here experienc-
ing this with me,” she said. “I go 
home a little calm because I know 
a lot of people know.”

After losing two of three games against 
unranked Kentucky, Kevin O’Sullivan 
wanted to see more from his team.
He witnessed it slightly in Florida’s 3-2 
win over No. 12 Florida State on Tuesday, 
but as the Gators trudge through South-
eastern Conference play, the ninth-year 
head coach wants his team to toughen up and show some grit.
“We need to be forced into playing at a 
higher level mentally,” he said.
A showdown with the No. 1 team in the country might do the trick.
No. 2 Florida (24-3, 4-2 SEC) clashes 
with top-ranked Texas A&M in Gainesville at McKethan Stadium at 7 p.m., the first of a three-game set this weekend.
“I wanna see how we play against one 
of the best teams in the country, if not the best team in the country,” O’Sullivan said.
“Playing a team like A&M is going to 
force our dugout and our players to kind of rise to the occasion.”
Texas A&M has won nine of the last 11 
contests with the Gators, including two of three the last time the two teams met in TOP-RANKED TEST

Eight out of 10.
That’s how Florida coach J.C. Deacon as-
sessed the men’s golf team’s focus and prepa-
ration during practice following a last-place 
finish at the Valspar Collegiate on March 22.
“Hasn’t been perfect, but it’s been good,” 
Deacon said of the team’s commitment in prac-
tice. “The guys who have needed to work hard 
have, and I think the wake-up call kind of hit home.”The Valspar Collegiate was the first last-
place finish of Deacon’s career — as a head coach, assistant coach or player.
“I just was super disappointed with our 
preparation,” Deacon said. “We got exactly 
what we deserved. It was our worst prepa-
ration of the year … When you go and play against great teams like that, you gotta be pre-pared, and we weren’t even close.
“All of us had to pay the price … I think all 
the guys learned a lesson.”
The No. 7 Gators will have a chance to right 
the ship as they head to Franklin, Tennessee, to compete in the Mason Rudolph Champion-
ship on Saturday and Sunday. 
The 54-hole tournament will feature 36 
holes of play on Saturday and conclude with 
18 holes on Sunday. It will be the first time the Gators have ever competed in the event.In addition to Florida, 13 teams, including 
Southeastern Conference foes No. 4 Alabama and No. 5 Vanderbilt, will grace the rolling hills and tree-lined fairways of the 7,100-yard Vanderbilt Legends Club.
Ben Hogan Award watch list nominee Sam 
Horsfield will open up Florida’s five-man line-up. The freshman, who has two victories this season, finished tied for 20th at the Valspar — 
his worst finish of the Spring season.
Freshman Jorge Garcia, who has been 
fighting his swing all year, will play the two-Florida heads to Tennessee looking to rebound from last-place finishFlorida hosts No. 1 Texas A&M

Florida is primed for yet anoth-
er National Championship berth. 
But that trip to Fort Worth, Tex-
as, has yet to be set in stone. 
This Saturday at 5 p.m., the 
No. 2-ranked Gators will take the 
mat at the University of Minne-sota’s Sports Pavilion, squaring off against five of the country’s best squads in NCAA Minneapolis Gymnastics Regional action. 
“We’re all super excited going 
in,” sophomore Kennedy Baker said. “Basically, we have pretty 
much NCAA lineups. It’s definitely 
a practice NCAA. It’s six teams, so it’s exactly like the first day and the second day of NCAA’s.”
Take a look at what the Gators 
are up against, and that categori-zation holds true. 
Bracketed at random from the 
nation’s top 36 gymnastics pro-
grams, Florida’s opposition in-
cludes No. 11 Denver, No. 16 Min-nesota, No. 20 Missouri, No. 28 Ohio State and No. 31 BYU.
While facing stiff competi-tion, history favors the Gators — they boast a perfect 40-0-0 record against those four teams.
Furthermore, the team has his-
torically performed well at the re-gional level, finishing either first or 
second in each of the last 15 years. However, this meet presents an 
element of uncertainty. 
Of the bunch, Florida has only 
seen intraconference rival Mis-
souri during the regular season this year. You’d have to go back 
to 2013 to find Minnesota on the slate, and even further back to en-
counter any of the three remaining teams. 
In spite of this, the Gators are 
confident, buoyed by a solid string of practices that purposely mim-
icked this week’s championship lead-up.
“This was the first week in 11 
weeks that the Gators have not 
had a competition over the week-end,” head coach Jenny Rowland said Monday. 
“We compete this upcom-
ing Saturday, so we modeled last week’s training schedule (off of that) and actually had a Saturday practice, had a little mock meet, and the girls did a great job. The energy was incredibly high this past week.”
Combine that energy with Flor-
ida's usual confidence, and the 
Gators emerge as a clear favorite 
to snag one of the top-two finishes required to book a spot the Nation-al Championships on April 15. 
“Regionals is really great for 
us because we’ve gone through SEC’s, and now it’s like our kind of stepping stone to Nationals,” sophomore Grace McLaughlin 
said. “We don’t really have to 
blow it out of the park this time.
“We just kinda have to go in 
and be normal, like Jenny always talks about, and just do our rou-tines and really focus on doing the little details better than we did at SEC’s.”

alopez@alligator.orgOne step away: UF gymnastics eyeing spot in national championship
2014.
Although O’Sullivan is 5-1 against top-
ranked teams, he’s just 1-3 versus the Ag-
gies in his career.
And when they come to Gainesville, 
throw out the rankings.
“Whether they’re ranked or not, ranked 
first or 25th, you’re gonna have your 
hands full,” O’Sullivan said.
This year, Texas A&M (22-3, 4-2 SEC) 
has won each of its first two SEC series and squashed No. 15 Houston 7-2 on Tuesday.
The similarities between UF and TAMU 
are seemingly endless.
Both teams boast nearly identical re-
cords.
And as O’Sullivan said, both teams do 
everything well — from pitching and hit-ting to running the bases and playing solid defense. 
Put simply, Texas A&M is a well-round-
ed club, one that the Gators could easily 
see in June.
“These are the types of teams that 
you’re going to have to play if you want to 
hoist that trophy at the end of the year,” 
O’Sullivan said. “These are the types of 
teams you’re going to have to beat.”The Aggies' strength is their hitting. 
Led by senior outfielder J.B. Moss’ .410 mark, they’re hitting .335, which leads the conference and is fourth best in the na-tion.
Countering TAMU's offense will be 
Florida’s pitching staff, headlined by ju-nior Logan Shore (5-0, 2.89 ERA), who will start tonight.
Shore said TAMU’s hitters are, for the 
most part, older and consistent. He said the challenge will be to keep them off bal-ance.
“As a pitching staff, we’ve got to ex-
ecute pitches this weekend if we want to have success,” Shore said.
Although his season’s been a bit in-
consistent to his standards, Shore said he 
feels confident. 
Despite the hype, the Coon Rapids, 
Minnesota, native is treating this start just 
like any other.
“You only get to pitch once a week,” 
Shore said. “Every Friday comes around, I’m excited to pitch, whether it’s Texas A&M or whoever we’re playing.”
Sophomore right-hander Alex Faedo (5-
0, 2.70 ERA) will start Saturday at 7:30 p.m. after having served as the Sunday starter all season. 
Junior lefthander A.J. Puk (1-2, 3.49 
ERA) will take the mound Sunday at 2 
p.m.
Tonight’s game can be watched on SEC 
Network+, while the Saturday and Sun-
day contests will air on ESPNU.

“The last couple days have been huge for 
me,” Garcia said. “It’s been pretty tough to 
figure what the actual problem is. A lot of it 
is, I think, how my mind is working towards the shots. (Wednesday) we figured out that I just have to train my eye to see the shot a little easier.
“I’m looking forward to a good week.”Sophomore Alejandro Tosti, junior Ryan 
Orr and freshman Gordon Neale will round out the Gators’ lineup. For Neale, it will be the first time the California native has been in-
cluded in the lineup since the Dick’s Sporting 
Goods Collegiate Challenge on Sept. 27. His last competitive event was as an individual at the SunTrust Gator Invitational on Feb. 21 
where he finished in a tie for 19th at even par. 
“The talent was never the issue,” Deacon 
said of Neale. “The mind was the issue.”
Talent and attitude aside, Saturday and 
Sunday’s tournament marks the final event on the Gators’ schedule before they head to 
St. Simons, Georgia, to compete in the SEC Championship. 
Deacon said he’s looking for toughness 
and focus out of his team.
“I wanna see what these guys have,” Dea-
con said. “We gotta be an SEC-ready team this week and to kinda show ourselves we can be 
the Alabamas and the Vanderbilts going into 
the biggest tournament of the year.
“We got one tournament to prepare for 
(the SEC Championship). The guys have done a good job, and they’re ready to go … I’m 
pumped to see what they can do.”

Nearly everything went right for the 
Florida men’s tennis team in the month of 
March.
The No. 11 Gators (11-4, 6-1 Southeast-
ern Conference) played some of their best 
tennis in years, skyrocketing up 30 spots in 
the national rankings. Junior Elliott Orkin won SEC Player of the Week on March 30 and Alfredo Perez garnered SEC Freshman of the Week twice on March 2 and March 23.
Most importantly, Florida got off to a tor-
rid start in conference play, going 6-1 over the course of the month to launch itself into 
second place in the SEC standings.
With March now over, UF hopes to con-
tinue that success into April, starting tonight 
when the Gators take on the No. 43 Vander-bilt Commodores (12-9, 3-3 SEC) at 5 p.m. at the Ring Tennis Complex in Gainesville.
“To get a streak going in the middle of 
the SEC program is pretty difﬁ  cult,” coach Bryan Shelton said. “(But) I feel like we’ve 
got the right guys here that can sustain 
something like this.”
Doubles play has been a prime focus for 
Florida this week. Despite ultimately win-ning both matches, UF struggled last week-end against Mississippi State and Alabama in doubles competition, losing four out of six sets.
“We’ve worked on our net game, worked 
on our return of serves, speciﬁ  cally towards the doubles,” Shelton said. “… but it’s just been good to be outside and play in the heat and just work on our conditioning at the same time.”
The Gators are set to face a Vanderbilt team that has won four of their past ﬁ  ve 
matches, including victories against then-
No. 7 Texas A&M and then-No. 17 Kentucky.
Vanderbilt also has a couple of top-100 
singles players in sophomore Daniel Valent and freshman Cameron Klinger and boasts a top-35 doubles tandem in Klinger and senior Rhys Johnson.
For Florida senior Gordon Watson, the 
focus this week has not been on tonight’s opponent, but what he and his teammates can do to be more prepared.
“Everybody has their certain things that 
they need to get better at,” Watson said. “That’s what the coaches are here for. They 
tell us what we need to do and critique a 
couple things here and there (so we can) get back to work to get to it on Friday.”

The softball team will take on its 
toughest test of the season against 
No. 6 Alabama at 6 p.m. . 
The No. 1 Gators (33-1, 8-1 South-
eastern Conference) and the Crimson Tide (29-6, 3-3 SEC) have won every SEC regular-season championship 
since 2008. 
“This is a phenomenal rivalry,” 
coach Tim Walton said. “Who wins 
this series, not always, usually wins the SEC.”
But the three-game series over 
the weekend has added meaning, as both teams will wear yellow uniforms on Saturday to spread awareness for 
pediatric cancer. Before the game, 
Terri Braswell will throw out the ﬁ  rst pitch about two years after losing her 17-year-old daughter and honorary UF teammate, Heather Braswell, to 
brain cancer. 
“I think that whenever she steps 
on the ﬁ  eld it’s going to bring back 
some memories,” senior Kirsti Mer-
ritt said. “It’s hard to even talk about 
it, to even think about it, but I hope that we can help her get through that day.”
Gator softball players from years 
past will also be in town for alumnae weekend. 
“This was one of those weekends 
that we put a star by at the beginning of the school year,” Walton said. “Not only because it’s Alabama, but we’re trying to have our alumnae more con-nected to our program.”
Walton said the team wouldn’t 
be where it is today, and some of the team’s great players wouldn’t be go-
ing to Florida without the foundation 
the alumnae laid. But aside from the events sur-
rounding the games, Florida’s full fo-cus will be on Alabama.
The Gators are off to the best start 
in school history and have the highest winning percentage in the nation by a healthy margin. 
Meanwhile, Alabama comes in 
with history on its side. The Crim-son Tide hold the all-time series lead, 33-30, and has a 14-10 advantage in Gainesville. 
Alabama will look to capitalize on 
UF’s slow offensive starts with pitcher Sydney Littlejohn, who boasts a 12-2 record and a 1.65 ERA that’s good for 47th in the nation. 
But Littlejohn might ﬁ  nd herself in 
a pitching duel with UF sophomore Aleshia Ocasio, who is 12-1 on the year and leads the nation with a 0.36 ERA.
But on Saturday, no pitcher will 
get more attention than Braswell. 
“When we won (the national 
championship) in 2014,” senior Au-
bree Munro said, “we brought her 
down on the ﬁ  eld to be with us and to share in that moment, because she had just lost her daughter and she was with us every step of the way. 
“To have her there for all of that  
and then two years later that she’s still with us, I think means so much to us.”
