The Democratic Party’s big-
gest names gathered in Charlotte, 
N.C., to support President Barack 
Obama’s bid for a second term, but 
some of his hardest-working stu-dent supporters watched crowded around a projector screen at UF.
Wearing Obama T-shirts and 
stickers, students met in the Reitz Union Matthews Suite from 7:30 p.m. to nearly midnight to watch speeches from Vice President Joe 
Biden and Obama.
“We’ve had a great response,” 
said UF College Democrats Presi-dent William Farrell, 20.
About 80 people attended the 
watch party throughout the eve-
ning. 
The room was especially 
packed during Obama’s nomina-
tion acceptance speech.
“It’s a good reminder of why 
all of us are out there working and donating our free time to make 
sure the president is re-elected,” Farrell said.
The environmental science ju-
nior said he thinks many students are thankful for Obama’s policies and would like to give him an-other term.
“2008 was an incredibly special 
year,” he said, adding that this year’s election is just as impor-tant. “We’re going to work really hard to make sure the turnout is 
as high as pos-
sible.”
The Gators 
for Obama com-mittee has been 
working every 
weekday to reg-ister students, said co-chair 
Rachel McGovern, a 20-year-old political science junior.
The organization is focusing 
on voter registration until the Oct. 9 deadline.“People know we’re there,” 
McGovern said. “We have people coming up to the tables.”
Thursday night, Biden spoke at 
9:30 p.m., drawing applause from 
the students as he talked about 
the bailout of General Motors and the death of Osama bin Laden.
Obama accepted the nomina-
tion at about 10:30 p.m. after be-ing introduced by ﬁ  rst lady Mi-chelle Obama. 
His speech covered topics like 
college education, job creation and clean energy. 
He also covered the controver-
sial issue of women’s reproduc-tive rights, and promised that the war in Afghanistan will be over in Jaylen Watkins 
and Florida have 
to deal with Texas 
A&M’s up-tempo 
attack in Saturday’s 
SEC opener.

A University Avenue student center will 
transform into a food and business center 
next year.
The Presbyterian and Disciples of Christ 
Student Center, located at 1402 W. Univer-sity Ave., will leave its current building, and the space will reopen in the summer 
of 2013 as U14, a hub of seven retail spaces 
and food venues.
The move will also affect the 35-year-old 
Burrito Bros. Taco Co. that resides in the back of the building, a restaurant staple for 
the Gainesville community.
Seth Lane, a director of Front Street 
Commercial Real Estate Group, said his 
company is planning to get Burrito Bros. a 
renovated space in U14.
Lane said the center is expanding to 
about 9,500 square feet. There will be sev-
en suites for retail and a 6,500-square-foot porch for patrons.
About 20 businesses have shown inter-
est, Lane said.
UF architecture alumni Elaina Berkow-
itz and Roland Faust designed the plans for the center as part of a design competition hosted by the developers. The contest was only open to UF juniors and seniors.
Project architect Stephen Bender said 
having that student involvement adds to the value of the property.
“It was really fun to work on and for 
us it was a really exciting project,” said Berkowitz, 22. “It meant a lot to be able to create a new icon in the community.”

� THE EVENT WILL FEATURE 
WORLD WAR II PHOTOGRAPHS.

The new Reitz Union Board Enter-
tainment Arts Committee will host its 
ﬁ  rst event Monday.
The UF Then & Now gallery will 
show photographs of UF from the mid-
20th century with modern backdrops. 
The event, which will be held at 8 p.m. 
in Orange & Brew, is free for students.
The photographer, 45-year-old Pam 
Marlin, works as a graduate program as-sistant in UF’s physics department. She 
got the idea from a project that featured 
World War II photographs in front of 
their present-day scenes.Twenty of her UF photographs will 
be at Monday’s gallery, which she will 
be attending. Her favorite features an 
old-fashioned car full of children on a 
dirt path in front of Smathers Library. 
Now, the sidewalk is paved and has a 
lush landscape.
“We always live in the present but 
don’t think about the past,” Marlin said. “That was the goal: to remember.”
RUB has never done a gallery show 
like this because they’ve never had an 
arts committee, said RUB adviser Di-
anna Lampitt. The organization added it to broaden student input within the 
Reitz Union.
“We cover pretty much everything 
besides the art faction,” Lampitt said. 
“We wanted the students to have a bet-
ter voice in the union.”New RUB art committee to

As reggae music blared 
through the loudspeakers, Mi-
chael Espinosa’s workout class 
prepared to get sweaty.  
“I’m going to say the reps,” 
Espinosa said, “and you’ll either 
say ‘Hell yeah’ or ‘Hell naw.’”
“Three. Two. One. Squats.”“Hell yeah,” the class of four 
shouted.
The Ark School of Fitness Inc., 
a nonprofit gym located at 22 NE 
11 St., opened three weeks ago 
and aims to provide a low-cost location for people to work out.
The highest price for member -
ship is $150 per month. 
However, prices are deter -
mined by the patron’s income. 
If someone’s income is 125 
percent under the U.S. poverty 
guideline, he or she could pay as 
low as $1 a month.
The Ark looked more like a 
warehouse when compared to 
other gyms. 
A large fan kept the 200-square-
foot room cool. Barbells laid in 
the corner. Weights were stacked against the wall. Ropes hung 
from the banister.
So far, Espinosa said, custom-
ers have been slow to come in.
Espinosa, a 27-year-old UF 
alumnus, said he has always 
thought about opening a gym of 
his own. He said he chose the nonprofit 
model to be able to give his pa-
trons athletic services and nutri-tion education for a cheaper price than for-profit centers.
The gym is giving free yoga classes at 10 a.m. Saturday and Sunday as a way to attract more 
members.  Patrons of the gym, including 
several UF students and alumni, sweated and strained during a 
Wednesday night workout.
John Trujillo, a 21-year-old UF 
neurobiology senior, wiped sweat 
from his nose with his shirt.
His sister Maria Trujillo, a 
25-year-old UF alumna, said 
Wednesday was her third session at The Ark.
She said she decided to check 
out the gym after hearing about 
it through a friend, and she kept 
coming back for the personal workout help.
Espinosa said his workouts 
are meant to get people moving and to increase people’s ability to work out, not necessarily their muscle mass.  
“We’re not worried about 
isolated movements,” he said. “We’re not bodybuilders.”
Espinosa said the nonprofit 
model means his gym is focused 
on helping the community and 
providing a quality space for low-income students and residents to get a good workout.
“It’s something that’s needed 
in the community,” he said.FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 7, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 3

“It was breathtaking,” said el-
ementary education sophomore Mi-
caela Jones, 19. She cried during the 
speech.
While watching Obama speak, stu-
dents at the watch party filled all the seats in the room, and some even had 
to sit on the floor. But they didn’t mind — hyped 
up on the energy around them and 
on screen, they clapped, cheered and chanted.
“It’s so empowering to see people 
that have so many similar beliefs — I can’t even describe it. It fills me with so much passion,” Jones said.
Political science sophomore Chris-
tine Csencsitz, 19, said Obama came 
across as genuine and relatable.
“I think because it was so tailored 
to this campaign, it really struck a 
chord with a lot of people,” she said.4, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 7, 2012

UF Large Animal Hospital veterinary technician Cheryl Gallowitz, 38, 
makes salsa at the Innovation CoLab in Weimer Hall on Thursday. 
� HER SALSA RECIPE IS 
TASTED NATIONALLY. 
MICHAEL SCOTT DAVIDSON
Alligator Writer
The recipe started with a can 
of diced tomatoes and ended 
with a national championship.
Gainesville resident Cheryl 
Gallowitz was named the win-
ner of Moe’s Southwest Grill 
Raise the Salsa Bar Contest on Aug. 30. Contest participants submitted their homemade sal-sa recipes online for a chance to win $1,000 and have their salsa featured in restaurant locations nationwide in 2013.
Gallowitz’s homemade 
“Three Bears Salsa” was cho-
sen over other salsa finalists 
“Quentin Jalapeño” and “Fires 
of Hell” by the company’s ex-
ecutive chef.
In spite of her recent culinary 
success, Gallowitz said she still considers herself a novice in the kitchen.
The 38-year-old UF Large 
Animal Hospital veterinary technician prefers the safety of 
a handheld vegetable chopper 
to kitchen knives and has no qualms eyeballing ingredient amounts.
“The only time I was precise 
was when I submitted the recipe online,” she said. “I do my best not to cut myself or mutilate the ingredients.”
For the self-proclaimed 
rookie cook, creating the salsa was a process of trial and error spurred by necessity.
In 2010, Gallowitz was pre-
paring to move to Gainesville 
from upstate New York. With-
out her favorite New York res-taurant, Mexican cantina Santa Fe, she was left in a spicy co-nundrum.
In a feat of sheer palate pow-
er, Gallowitz set to replicate the recipe’s unique style. It only took her six tries.
“I just knew the flavors I was 
looking for,” she said. “They’re not really unusual ingredients.”
She diced yellow and white 
onions for a sweet and salty background to the salsa. 
Sprinkling in just enough 
pickled jalapenos added a con-ventional, subtle spice to the 
salsa, she said.
“I was trying to emulate the 
freshness and tartness of it,” 
Gallowitz said. “It wasn’t over -
ly sweet.”
The result is a taste that’s 
“not too hot, not too mild,” ac-cording to Gallowitz. She said she originally wanted to name 
her recipe “Goldilocks Salsa,” a 
homage to the timeless fairytale; she decided against it before entering the contest, settling in-stead for “Three Bears Salsa.”
Gallowitz said she was pleas-
antly surprised to have won the competition.
After all, she said, “Three 
Bears Salsa” was the first recipe she’s ever created.
“For something I just took a 
chance on, it paid off,” she said.

The world’s only flying mam-
mals are going to rise from the 
darkness at UF today.
The Florida Museum of Natural 
History will host the “Year of the 
Bat Celebration” from 6 p.m. to 8 
p.m. The free event is open to ev-eryone.
Catherine Carey, public pro-
grams coordinator for the museum, said visitors will see displays by the natural history museum, the Lubee Bat Conservancy and the Tampa Bay Bats.
This is the first “Year of the Bat 
Celebration” at UF.
The event was created in con-
junction with the Year of the Bat, a two-year global campaign to raise awareness about the importance of bats.
About 40 percent of bat species 
in the United States are on the edge of extinction, Carey said.
“We want to do anything we 
can to bring awareness,” she said.
Amanda Harvey, education as-
sistant at the museum, said there will be different activities for visi-tors, including games. Tampa Bay Bats will bring four different spe-cies of bats for visitors to interact with from a few feet away.
Despite their negative image, 
bats help pollinate and control in-sect populations, she said.
“We wouldn’t have tequila, 
coffee or macadamia nuts without them,” Harvey added.UF campus

An Apple announcement scheduled for 
Wednesday has people across the nation — 
and UF’s campus — buzzing about possible new products.
Invitations to the private event feature a 
large, black “12” — a reference to the date. But the number’s shadow doesn’t match up. It’s a gray “5.”
Pasha Antonenko, an assistant professor of 
educational technology at UF, said he’s antici-pating the announcement. He’s been waiting 
for the iPhone 5, which is rumored to have a 
larger display screen and a smaller dock con-nector, to come out for a while.
But new features aren’t enough for some 
UF students.
Criminology junior Courtney Marasigan, 20, said she just bought an iPhone 4S, so she’s not likely to purchase a new one if announced next week. Still, Marasigan said she’d rather Apple release a new iPhone than a new iPad.
According to technology blogs, the iPhone 
5 will likely be slimmer and lighter than its predecessors.
However, some college students’ budgets 
often don’t leave room for purchases based solely on updated features.
“I am absolutely content with the iPhone 
4,” said 25-year-old environmental science ju-nior Giannette Rodriguez. “I don’t even have 
the iPhone 4S. The only difference is the Siri.”Students react to new iPhone possibilities
ObAmA , from page 1Students: Obama is “genuine”The RUB committee will manage 
the Reitz Union art gallery
Digital arts and sciences junior Jordan 
Fine, one of the committee’s directors, has 
been on the Special Events Committee since 
his freshman year. Fine, 20, primarily fo-
cused on graphic design, so when he heard 
that RUB was adding an arts committee, he 
applied to be a director.
The team, which currently consists of 
Fine and co-director Fabiola Lara, will man-
age the art gallery on the second floor of the 
Reitz Union. They’ll also have space in the 
Rion Ballroom and Orange & Brew to hold shows throughout the semester, Fine said.
There will be a graphic design team with-in the arts committee that will serve the en-
tire organization. Applicants interested in 
the graphic design team will have to submit 
a portfolio with their application, Fine said.
RUB is also taking applications for their 
other four committees — bands, lectures and 
comedians, films and special events — until 
Sept. 14.
Fine said he’s optimistic about the gallery 
show and is glad RUB now has a committee 
targeted more for his interests.
He’s hoping UF alumni will come to Mon-
day’s event, too. The Then & Now pictures link current and former Gators.
“We kind of like to encourage art in the 
community,” Fine said.RUb , from page 1“We wouldn’t have te-

Wizards and Muggles alike crowded 
the main Health Science Center Library 
on Thursday afternoon.
The grand opening of the “Harry Pot-
ter’s World: Renaissance Science, Magic and Medicine” exhibit attracted more than 200 people, including students and 
families, said Michele Tennant, bioinfor-
matics librarian.
Tennant, 53, who wore a “I AM A 
MUGGLE” sign on her chest and another that read “REALLY” on her back, smiled 
to guests as she waved around a blue 
wand she made at an activity table.
“I feel great because we had no idea 
this many people were going to show up,” Tennant said.
College students and children gathered 
to write with invisible ink, shine pennies to look golden and make tea bags ﬂ  oat, with Patty Lipka, the program director at the Cade Museum for Creativity and In-
vention’s table.
“I am here from the Ministry of Cre-

IS RANKED NO. 6.

UF is the No. 1 party school in the 
nation, according to rankings released 
last week by Unigo, a college resource 
website.
Unigo based its rankings off of 
300,000 campus lifestyle reviews sub-
mitted to the site. The only other Flor-
ida school on the 2013 “Fifty Shades of 
Cray” list was Florida State University at No. 6.
Year-round sunny weather, foot-
ball culture, dating scene and substan-
tial Greek life were listed as reasons 
for UF’s prime spot on the Top 10 list. Unigo acknowledged Gator Nights as UF’s option for students who choose to 
abstain from the party scene.
“UF shows up in all kinds of rank-
ings,” university spokesman Steve 
Orlando said. “Some ranking systems are better than others. Honestly, I’d 
never heard of this one until now, but 
I’m glad to see they mentioned Gator Nights.”
Political science junior Troy Robin-
son, 20, said he believed the ranking unfairly generalized UF — reviewers used the school’s size and location to stereotype the student body.
“From outside of Florida, the weath-
er can be seen as nice, so UF could be seen as a party school,” he said. “From within, we are used to this, so it’s the same as any other large university.”UF ranked 
No. 1 party

There may be fewer tents up 
on football game days this year.
The Gainesville City Com-
mission voted 4-0 Thursday 
night in favor of a new ordinance 
that would prevent bars with un-
derage drinking violations from selling alcohol outdoors during game days.
Three commissioners were 
absent for the vote, including Todd Chase, who voiced his op-position to the measure in the ﬁ  rst readings of the ordinance.
Although Chase was present 
for Thursday’s meeting, he said he stepped out to use the rest-room a few minutes before the 
commission voted on the mea-
sure, which caused him to miss the vote.
“I’m not at all comfortable 
with the concept of economic deterrents against businesses,” Chase said after the meeting. “I didn’t see the need to effectively punish a very small portion of the business community.”
The current underage drink-
ing ordinance requires that a certain number of violations be 
reached before bars face any con-sequences.
For example, a venue with 
a capacity of 200 people or less 
would need ﬁ  ve arrests or notic-es within  three months. For bars with a larger capacity, that num-ber becomes 10 arrests within 
three months.
The new ordinance will join 
longer-standing decrees, which 
mainly prohibit the entry of un-derage patrons after 9 p.m.

Flaco’s in Midtown?Today’s question: Did you watch either political party’s 
conventions? A need for pragmatism over ideology
As this column is being written, the Democratic Na-
tional Convention in Charlotte, N.C., is kicking off its second day . Already we have heard inspirational 
messages of progress from the likes of Massachusetts Gov . Deval Patrick and First Lady Michelle Obama.
Unfortunately , these inspirational messages sound far 
more tepid than they did in 2008. In the wake of continued economic distress for millions of unemployed Americans, and the worst level of political stalemate and income inequal-ity seen since the Gilded Age, President Obama is struggling to sell himself to the American people for a second term.
To be fair, the president has accomplished a host of admi-
rable feats, not the least of which are: averting a depression, ending the war in Iraq, ordering the operation to take down 
Osama bin Laden, repealing “don’t ask, don’t tell,” taking 
steps to ensure pay equality for women and expanding health care coverage to millions of more Americans.
At the same time, the president has disappointed liberals 
in probably the same number of ways. His most unforgivable action while in ofﬁ  ce may be his willingness to solidify our government as being bought and paid for by Wall Street.
Despite speaking on the campaign trail of changing the 
culture on Wall Street, and avoiding the insane practice of 
trying the same things over again and expecting different re-
sults, he did exactly that: He appointed the very same people to his economic team that pushed through the policies that plunged our economy into recession in the ﬁ  rst place.
By embedding incompetent scoundrels like Timothy 
Geithner and Larry Summers into the upper echelons of his administration, Obama showed his true colors as a corpo-rate democrat reluctant to challenge the systematic corrup-tion and recklessness of the out-of-control banking industry , 
which to this day , has kept average citizens in anguish while 
allowing executives to shower themselves with absurd sala-ries and bonuses.
With all this being said, the classic political dilemma aris-
es yet again: choosing between the lesser of two evils.
This election, however, is no contest.In selecting between a moderate liberal who has betrayed 
the left in a handful of ways and a coreless, ﬂ  ip-ﬂ  opping right-winger, the choice is stark.
The primary dilemma, rather, 
arises in deciding whether to vote according to principle or ac-cording to practicality . The true 
progressive party in this country 
is not the Democratic Party , but arguably the Green Party , which this year is running Dr. Jill Stein as its candidate for president.
In the latest issue of “The Progressive” magazine, Stein 
tells editor Matthew Rothschild why she is running against Obama: “Working people have been betrayed by Obama,” noting that he has largely ignored unions and hasn’t fought 
for minimum wage increases. Concerning foreign policy, 
she cites that the president “expanded the drone wars and surged troops into Afghanistan … ” and on the environment, she says that he has “undermined international accords and scuttled the effort to get climate change under control.”
These are all valid arguments.Nevertheless, it doesn’t take a veteran political strategist 
to understand a vote for any party other than the Democrats or the Republicans is simply, for all practical purposes, a vote 
wasted.
The reality of our current and longstanding system is that 
if you want a relatively liberal or progressive (i.e. sane) candi-
date in ofﬁ  ce, you simply must vote for a Democrat.
Hopefully, one day our country will break the strangle-
hold the two-party system has on our politics, making way for an effective third party in the vein of the Progressive Party of 1912 or the Green Party of today.
Until then, the left must hold true to the principle that de-
ﬁ  nes progressivism — pragmatism. Unlike extreme libertari-ans, who by deﬁ  nition reject pragmatism and instead rely on rigid ideology , liberals and progressives must proudly hold on to their pragmatism by understanding that the only effec-tive votes citizens can cast this year for progress are votes for President Obama and the Democratic Party.

Congratulations to Former President Bill Clinton for mak-
ing the Democratic National Convention a real good time. His speech was easily the crowd favorite on Wednesday night’s primetime coverage of the event. We give a we-wish-Billy-and-Biden-would-run-together-in-2016 LAUREL to Bill Clinton. 
We’re a fan of anyone who goes after vice presidential candi-
date Paul Ryan’s stance on Medicare, by saying it “takes some brass to attack a guy for doing what you did.”
Someone celebrated Labor Day a little on the unorthodox 
side; a Gainesville man used his apartment to cook meth. The thing is, his neighbors happened to be a police annex. We give a sorry-you’re-not-Walter-White-also-stop-cooking-meth-with-children-in-the-house DART to Marty Holder.
Way to keep it classy . Poor Tom Brokaw. On a broadcast of “Morning Joe” on 
Thursday morning, he appeared light-headed and was taken to 
a hospital. Turns out he “mistakenly” took half a dose of Am-
bien and felt a little woozy. We give a maybe-slow-down-your-schedule-a-little-bit LAUREL to Tom Brokaw. 
At least he felt well enough to joke about football in a tweet: 
“All is well Early AM I mistakenly took a half dose of Ambien and made less sense than usual. Made a better comeback than Giants...”
 Not only has Paul Ryan lied about how fast he can run a mile 
(his actual time was slower than formerly rogue Gov. Sarah Pa-
lin), he also lied about climbing 40 mountains. Sure, he told a 
paper in 2009 that he had climbed “close to 40” mountains that measure 14,000 feet or more; these mountains are called the “Fourteeners.” We give a his-name-should-be-Paul-Lyin’-but-really-please-stop-lying-about-facts-and-feats DART to Paul 
Ryan.
At least he’s still got his looks?Let’s not forget that time Rush Limbaugh called Georgetown 
law student Sandra Fluke a “slut” after arguing that health care plans should cover birth control. She was given the opportunity to speak at the DNC this week. She spoke about what the Ameri-ca under Mitt Romney would look like. It would be “an America in which access to birth control is controlled by people who will never use it, in which politicians redeﬁ  ne rape so survivors are victimized all over again.” We give her a four-for-you-you-go-girl LAUREL to Sandra Fluke.
You show those old white dudes who’s boss. 
Have you heard about all the physical feats Russia’s leader, 
Vladmir Putin, has achieved? Most recently he hang-glided with 
cranes to show them which direction south is. He hunts with riﬂ  es while not wearing a shirt. He’s too good at judo. He scuba dives to deep archaeological sites. He also plays the piano really well. We give a step-up-your-physical-game-American-govern-ment-ofﬁ  cials-but-don’t-lie-about-them DART to U.S. ofﬁ  cials.
And please, Mr. Putin, put your shirt back on. Have a safe weekend, Gators, and we’ll see you back next 
week!

How do you get an English major off of your porch? 
Pay for the pizza.
I see this idea constantly in articles, cartoons and 
blogs, and it drives me crazy: “A liberal arts degree is useless in this job market.”
I don’t know if the intended purpose is to scare away po-
tential liberal arts students or to pressure universities to focus more on vocation-specific types of training or just to make people like me furious. The liberal arts, as I understand it, are a field of academic studies meant to develop the intellectual abilities of the student, as opposed to occupational training, which prepares the student for a specific job.
I’m 30. I’ve been out there in the job market since I was 
18, doing everything from working behind a counter to 
construction to working on a fishing boat to serving on the 
ground in Iraq. I don’t mind manual labor, and as such, I will forever have a Plan B that I know won’t kill me.
I’m not in college to get a degree; I’m in college to get an 
education. If, after grad school, I find myself back on a build-ing site or in a uniform, so be it. If that happens, I know I’ll have the wherewithal to make the most out of any situation life throws me. And believe me, life can throw a curveball.
I think the obsession with downplaying the education 
level  of liberal arts majors is a big problem right now — the idea that it is the degree and not the education that gets a person where they want to be in life. For some professions, the degree is certainly important, but it’s the quality of learn-ing that takes place while earning the degree that seems to determine how successful one is likely to be.
Of course I want my physician to have a degree from a 
reputable institution, but more than that, I want him to re-ally know what he is doing. If you haven’t had a bad doctor 
experience, please trust me: Graduation from medical school 
alone isn’t enough. If it was, 
people wouldn’t have the wrong limbs occasionally amputated, or in my case, the wrong medicine prescribed (almost fatally).
Today’s liberal arts degree is the vestigial remnant of the 
once-mighty Trivium (grammar, rhetoric, logic) and Qua-drivium (arithmetic, geometry, music, astronomy).
Since classical antiquity, this education model has cre-
ated citizens as opposed to just workers. Most of the notable minds we encounter in our studies at the university level had such an education, including almost all of those credited with founding this country — though most of them had law degrees as well.
The result of this kind of educational worldliness is the 
ability to ask and begin to answer questions that are bigger than ourselves and even our societies. Not to say that getting 
a liberal arts degree will make you John Adams or Thomas 
Jefferson, but at least you will be able to read their work and follow along.
While degrees shouldn’t matter as much as the quality of 
education, they do in many cases, and a sad reality is that your liberal arts degree might not be enough. The same goes for business majors and biology majors and everyone else.
To be competitive in a non-entrepreneurial setting, it’s 
a good idea to go beyond the four-year degree, even if you 
have to work while you do it. A minor in a business or com-
puter science field can also help widen your job-searching net. Give yourself as many tools as you can to succeed, but don’t  graduate from college having learned to do a job and having failed to learn how to live and do what you love.
It’s a scary world out there, and graduating into it can 
be overwhelming. Don’t let the fear of not owning a yacht stop you from pursuing what you are passionate about. This country desperately needs many more people capable of thinking on their own, drawing their own conclusions and acting on those instead of what is popular or partisan.
Don’t let public opinion convince you that critical thinking 
and knowledge of humanity are unnecessary and frivolous. On the contrary, you can use those skills and that knowledge to adapt to any work or living situation, which will be more useful in the long run in this ever-changing, modern eco-nomic landscape.

Speaking OutIt’s impossible to avoid annoying people in class. You 
can, however, avoid becoming one of these people by doing your part to make a class a semipleasant experi-
ence for all.
The Tweaker
We’ve all been stuck next to that person who will not 
stop drumming a pen at hummingbird speed, tapping their 
foot on the tile or bouncing their leg a mile a minute, as if they’re temporarily possessed by the Energizer Bunny. That’s not making class go by any faster. In fact, such inces-sant tweaking makes it much slower for the rest of us with each tap, tick and shake. Do us all a favor and sit still, shut up and space out in silence like the rest of us.
The Know-It-All
There’s always the one kiss-ass who sits smack in the 
middle of the very front row with every intention of an-
swering every question before the professor even finishes their sentence. After the first 20 minutes of lecture, they proceed to debate on each point mentioned for the rest of class. Taking up the entire class time with your incessant babble is not going to get you participation points — it will get everyone in class to hate you.
The Overachiever
The overachiever is somewhat like the know-it-all 
in the sense that they both need to take a giant chill pill. 
This obnoxious student questions everything, takes notes frivolously and highlights them into a giant rainbow while stopping the teacher every minute or so for expansion, clarification or repetition of a simple concept.
The Party AnimalLikely a sorority sister or frat 
boy, this individual seems to think they are the only student letting 
loose on the weekend. They waddle in on Monday morn-ing and make proclamations like, “Man, I’m so hungover,” or “Oh my gosh, I’m never drinking again,” at which point they proceed to recap every event of their entire weekend. Once class begins, they decrease the volume of their voice only slightly and continue to brag about their recent alcohol consumption. Get a life. We all party, and you’re probably a 
lightweight anyway.
The Sniffler
The sniffler is that severely sick student who should 
have stayed in bed but decided to grace us all with their germs instead. They cough and blow their nose through the duration of class, and are most apt to attend on a test day when the air is silent — minus the turning of pages and un-relenting sniffling. If you’re lucky , you might get a chorus of snifflers, who seem to sniffle on cue like a round of “Row 
Your Boat.” DayQuil up, stay home or cram tissues up your 
nose, but don’t be a sniffler.

It’s a more than little ironic that an 
investigation into whether Virginia Tech officials acted in a “timely” 
fashion in the 2007 shooting has taken more than five years to complete.
Last week, Secretary of Education 
Arne Duncan reinstated a $27,500 fine on Virginia Tech for not providing a timely warning to the campus com-munity during the 2007 shooting.
Duncan’s reinstatement reversed a 
ruling by the Education Department’s chief administrative judge, who con-cluded Virginia Tech did not violate 
the law and thus overruled a 2010 find-
ing by an office in the department.
Under the Clery Act, which was en-
acted in 1990, universities that partici-pate in federal financial aid programs are required to keep and disclose information about crime on or near campus and issue warn-ings during p o t e n t i a l threats.
On April 
16, 2007, campus police received a 911 call at 7:15 a.m. about gunshots 
in a dormitory . Officers arrived at the 
scene 15 minutes later, where they found one student dead and another critically injured.
Administrators sent a campus-
wide email at 9:26 a.m. warning about a “shooting incident.”
Minutes after the email was sent, 
the same man in the dormitory opened 
fire again, this time in an academic 
building, where he killed 30 more stu-dents and professors, and himself.
Duncan’s Friday decision is the lat-est to come in a years-long investiga-tion. Federal officials first determined the university had violated the Clery Act in December 2010, saying the warning at 9:26 a.m. came too late and was too vague.
Rather than get tangled up in bu-
reaucracy , Virginia Tech and other 
college administrations can treat Dun-
can’s decision for what it is — a bar by which to measure campus safety and build a safer future for university com-munities. In the wake of tragedy, it is important to reflect on past events to figure out how to move forward. But eventually, and certainly five years down the line, you have to actually 
move forward.

Gainesville Police arrested a 
man for violating his restraining 
order and running away from officers.
Police charged John Fitzger -
ald Miles, 39, of 1307 NW Sixth St., on Wednesday with un-armed burglary , possession of cocaine and resisting arrest with violence, among other charges, according to a GPD arrest re-port.
Police gave the following ac-
count:
At about 9:30 p.m. Wednes-
day , police responded to a call from Granada Apartments, at 1800 NW Fourth St., about a man who was in an apartment and in violation of a restraining order.
When police arrived at the 
apartment, officers heard a man yelling from behind the door. Of-ficers knocked on the door, and Miles answered. Police asked 
Miles, who was sweating and appeared 
nervous, if he 
lived at the 
apartment. He said yes. 
The offi-
cer said she knew who 
Miles was and that he was vio-lating a restraining order.
Miles received the restraining 
order in April withh a domestic violence case, according to court records from the Alachua Coun-ty Clerk of the Court. The officer tried to arrest 
Miles, but he broke free from her grip, saying “I ain’t going to jail for this,” and ran. 
Police had to use a Taser sev-
eral times to subdue him.
A witness told police Miles 
entered his apartment earlier in the evening, started yelling and broke various items inside the 
apartment. The witness left the 
apartment and called his moth-er who then called police.
After his arrest, police took 
Miles to Alachua County Jail, where they found a small bag of cocaine inside his pocket.
Police booked Miles at 10:14 
p.m. Wednesday, where he re-
mained Thursday night with a 
bond set at $127,000.

This week in the Gainesville 
City Commission, the commission 
moved along the process to get 
city police funding for a police dog 
and other necessities, and the city power supplier kept a close eye on UF’s power contract, which is set to 
expire in less than two years.
Police Funding:
The Gainesville City Commis-
sion approved a request Thursday 
for Gainesville Police to receive 
funding from the Firehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation.
The department is requesting 
$12,000 from the foundation to buy a $9,500 police dog for its K-9 unit.
The department plans to use 
the leftover funds to buy three au-tomated external defibrillators, or 
AEDs, for their  patrol cars. The de-
vices are used to restart someone’s heart at the scene of an emergency.
About half of the funding for 
the foundation is provided through “rounding up,” where restaurant 
patrons are given the option to 
round up their purchases to the next dollar.
“Five or 10 cents over 500 res-
taurants adds up to over a million dollars every year,” said Robin Pe-ters, executive director of the foun-dation. “Small change equals big change.”
The other half of the funds come 
partly from traditional fundrais-ers such as golf and tennis tourna-ments.“The restaurants in Gainesville 
consistently place in the top 10 per -
cent of our top donors,” Peters said. “We like to put that money back into the community.”
Power contract:
With UF’s contract with Prog-
ress Energy up for renewal in less 
than two years, the university has begun preliminary discussions 
about the available options for the 
energy contract. UF could renew the contract with Progress Energy or instate a new contract with city-run Gainesville Regional Utilities.
In order for GRU to take an ac-
tive role in securing the contract, UF must request proposals from 
the energy company —  a step the 
university has not yet taken.
GRU already provides natural 
gas for campus labs, according to UF’s website.
GRU representative John Stan-
ton was unavailable for comment on the issue, and other GRU staff declined to comment pending a UF 
response.

A&M IN COLLEGE STATION ON SATURDAY AT 3:30 P.M.
GREG LUCA
Alligator Staff Writer
 
In all of his years playing and 
watching football, Jaylen Wat-
kins has never seen an offense 
this fast. 
While watching film of Hous-
ton’s 2011 attack, which coach 
Kevin Sumlin has brought to 
Texas A&M this season, Florida 
players were surprised by the speed of the nation’s most up-tempo offense. 
“They’re very fast,” Watkins 
said. “Probably the fastest of-fense I have ever seen, including the NFL.”
Houston ranked No. 1 in the 
nation with 8,387 total yards last season — nearly 600 per game and 700 more than No. 2 Baylor. 
The Cougars ran an NCAA-
most 1,102 plays last year, while 
second-ranked Clemson ran 
1,055. 
That 47-play margin is bigger 
than the gap between Clemson 
and No. 11 Oregon, which ran 
1,015. 
“They try to get you out of 
rhythm,” Watkins said. “Some-times they look back and they hike the ball, and you’re trying to get your call from your coach-es. They try to catch you off-balance when you’re not paying 
attention.”
To prepare, the Gators de-
fense has been running almost 
constantly in practice.
 There are no breaks after a 
play ends, not even time to jog back into position. The Gators know they won’t have time for that against the Aggies — they 
need to line up as quickly as 
possible and be ready for the next play. 
A Florida defense that fre-
quently rotated fresh players in and out during Saturday’s open-
er against B o w l i n g G r e e n 
might not 
have that 
luxury against Texas A&M.
Defensive coordinator Dan 
Quinn said he wants his team to be able to pressure the quar -
terback and play physical with the Aggies’ receivers, but both could be difficult given how 
quickly Texas A&M will look 
to get the ball out of freshman quarterback Johnny Manziel’s hands. 
And with how quickly the 
Gators are starting their South-
eastern Conference schedule, 
as UF prepares to face a league

Coming off a weekend stained with loss and 
disappointment, the Gators are looking to one 
another for motivation.
Florida (3-2) faces a trio of unranked squads 
this weekend, starting with winless Jacksonville 
(0-6) Friday at 7:30 p.m. as part of the annual 
Active Ankle Challenge. In practice leading up to the tournament and following losses to No. 4 Texas and No. 8 Stanford, Chloe Mann, Ziva Recek and the rest of the Gators are pushing each other.
Mann and Recek have been battling to be 
UF’s top attacker, and they said their neck-and-neck competition has fueled their performance.
“She makes me want to be crafty ,” Mann 
said of her freshman Slovenian teammate. “Her volleyball IQ, I feel like, is off the charts. She knows how to place the ball really well and it pushes me harder either when I’m hitting next to her or playing next to her to help increase my IQ and find shots on the court like she does.”Recek, the go-to outside hitter for Florida, 
was named Southeastern Conference Freshman of the Week on Tuesday because of her team-leading 37 kills over the weekend. Although the 6-foot freshman is already the holder of a new 
UF record (22 kills by a fresh-
man in a three-set match), Re-
cek said she feeds off of UF’s current points leader, Mann, and the rest of the team.
“Chloe is a great player 
and she always helps me when we’re standing to-
gether under the net,” Recek said. “She always reminds 
me of some important things.”
Mann has become the focus on Florida’s 
front line ever since her breakout performance on Nov . 11 of last season, when she had 18 kills and zero errors in 20 attacks. The junior middle blocker and Gainesville native hasn’t missed a step since, topping the squad in 10 offensive and defensive categories.
And although Mann said there is more pres-sure on her now, she added that the friendly rivalry with Recek, who ranks just behind Mann in five of those 10 statistics, has kept her grounded and focused on improving.
Coach Mary Wise was just happy to have 
someone step up to Mann’s level so quickly.
“Chloe’s numbers are not a surprise,” Wise 
said. “With Ziva, there were a lot of unknowns. With a freshman, you’re just hoping that they can make the adjustment to contribute in any small way. Because they play two different po-sitions . . . they complement one another.”
The duo’s one-two punch on the Gators’ 
front line is critical for Florida’s success in the Active Ankle Challenge. Mann and Recek kept 
the Gators’ alive against two top-10 teams last 
weekend, as they combined for 61 percent of the team’s kills, 53 percent of the team’s attacks and 57 percent of the team’s points.
“We learned more about ourselves from the 
second weekend,” Wise said. “We’ve had two really good practices and I like to think the team that comes out [tonight] will be even better than last weekend.”

Florida welcomes Texas A&M 
to the Southeastern Conference this weekend, and it’s coming up big. ESPN is setting up College Gameday in College Station, Texas, and Lee Cor -
so will end the broadcast wearing a big head of some sort. Once the game is over, we’ll strap on some spurs, en-joy some whiskey, swap manly stories and then perhaps a bit of Eastwooding with an invisible Will Muschamp on that empty bar stool. That will make our day. Boom.
Down there yonder by the old cor -
ral, Josh Jurnovoy and Adam Pincus 
have their guns at the ready as they debate the Georgia-Missouri matchup in Columbia, Mo. Draw!
Georgia (-2.5) will show Missouri 
that the SEC ain’t big enough for all 14 of ‘em because…
The Bulldogs have Aaron Murray. 
The junior quarterback, who is now in his 17th year at the helm, is too sea-soned to shrink from the spotlight in Memorial Stadium.
While the Bulldogs are going to 
have to rely on their young running backs most of this season, that is something they won’t have to worry about on Saturday as Murray and No. 1 receiver Tavarres King will  look like they are tossing in warm-ups against a Tigers pass defense that was ranked 94th in the country in 2011.
Adam believes his Tigers will 
somehow cover, but that’s even more foolish than picking the Gators to win nine games, which he also did.
Oh, and if Tigers’ quarterback 
James Franklin thought he could handle SEC speed, wait until he meets Jarvis Jones.Picks

◗ THE MEN’S AND WOMEN’S 
TEAMS DEBUT ON SUNDAY.
STAFF REPORT
 
When the Gators women’s golf 
team tees off this Sunday in Ha-
nahan, S.C., in the 2012 Cougar Classic, it will be their first tour -
nament under new Emily Bastel.
Bastel spent 10 months as an 
assistant at Florida before being promoted to head coach to re-place Jan Dowling, who resigned at the end of the 2011-12 season for personal reasons.
In addition to having a new 
coach, the Gators will also wel-come five newcomers, including freshmen Emma Smyser from Naples and Ursa Orehek from Domzale, Slovenia.
After losing three players to 
graduation, the Gators are look-ing to add depth with transfers Katie Mitchell from UCF, Emma Elcin Ulu from Redlands Com-munity College and Anna Young from Tulsa. No. 9 Florida will return its 
top two players — senior Mia Pic-cio and sophomore Camilla Hed-
berg — from last season’s squad, 
which finished 12th at the NCAA Cham-pionships. Last 
year, Piccio and 
Hedberg led the team in stroke average as well 
as combining for six top-10 fin-ishes. While the women are compet-
ing at Yeamans Hall Club, the men will follow closely behind as they head to Kiawah Island, S.C., to play in The Invitational at The Ocean Course to open their sea-son on Sunday. 
The men return all but Michael 
Furci and Zach Lee from last sea-
son’s squad. Furci and Lee only 
had 24.5 rounds combined that counted toward the Gators’ tour -
nament total last year. 
Like the women, the No. 12 
Gators will return their top two players. Seniors T.J. Vogel and Tyler McCumber combined for 16 top-10 finishes during the 2011-12 campaign. 
Last year, Vogel led Florida 
in tournaments at par or better (seven), average (71.3), birdies (132) and eagles (four), as well as recording the Gators’ only two 
individual wins.
Florida should feel confident 
as it heads into the Kiawah In-
vitational. The course gave the Gators its first of three wins last year.
With Bastel at helm, Florida set to begin new season

Missouri (+2.5) will show the ‘Dawgs there’s a new sher -
iff in town because…
The Tigers can flat out score and defend. While Georgia 
allowed 199 rushing yards to Buffalo last week in a 45-23 
win, Missouri held Southeastern Louisiana to 58 in an ole’ fashioned 62-10 first-week butt whoopin’.
Not to mention, the Missouri fans at Memorial Stadium 
will be rocking in the school’s first ever SEC game. Is Georgia ready for that?
James Franklin, the Tigers’ quarterback and the better 
James Franklin in the SEC, will torch Georgia with his arm and legs. Franklin ran for 981 yards last season. A struggling 
rush defense and this quarterback don’t mix.
-AdAm PincuS
Leading the way after the first week with a 7-1 record is our 
very own Josh “Whataburger is quality fast food” Jurnovoy, 
who botched any momentum he gained from his first-place 
finish last week by insisting that we stop at a Whataburger on 
the way to Texas. What the hell?
Entrenched in a six-way tie for second place with a 4-4 re-
cord is Rivals’ Bryan “Pent-up frustration” Holt, who hasn’t been quite as... active, let’s say, since moving from midtown. He can be heard at all hours furiously typing — that’s what the kids are calling it these days — on his poor HP laptop, which is now questionable for Saturday’s game. It’s not the computer’s fault, Bryan. 
Also sporting a 4-4 record is The Associated Press’ Mark 
“NEED MORE FOLLOWERS” Long, who is so desperate to add to his 4,138 followers on Twitter that he tried to get Jeff Driskel to recruit his parents. Sorry, Mark, but the Driskels 
aren’t interested in you dropping “LOL”s, smileys and use-
less Jaguars info on their feed.  
Fighting over silver with a 4-4 clip is alligatorSports edi-
tor Greg “Man-crushing on Mark Reynolds” Luca, who has 
been enthralled with the Orioles’ improbable run in the AL 
East race. The boy may leave the O’s, but apparently, the O’s never leave the boy. With all due respect to Cal Ripken Jr., nobody has cared this much about Baltimore baseball since, 
well, ever. Suck it, Yankees!
Next is assistant alligatorSports editor Joe “Not my stuffed 
animals!” Morgan, who frantically called a coworker late Sat-
urday night after leaving a stuffed Pumbaa in The Swamp’s press box. I guess we all could’ve used a snuggle buddy to 
ease the pain of watching Saturday’s dreadful performance, 
but jeez, man, be a professional! If you want to cuddle up with your pillow buddies and stick a thumb in your mouth on your own time, that’s fine. Just keep it out of the work-place. 
Then, there’s Adam “I’ve never seen a map” Pincus, who 
was concerned about the 3-hour time difference between Florida in the Eastern Time Zone and Texas in the Central 
Time Zone. Psst, it’s only a 1-hour change. This guy is one of the drivers for our trip today. Oh, God. What have we done?
Rounding out the second-placers is the Miami Herald’s 
Matt “Durka is my homegirl” Watts, who can be found most 
Friday nights cuddled up with his overweight, slutty cat — that’s Durka — and a laptop, clacking out angry thoughts about outdated sports cars on message boards. Get to bed, 
Watts; 3 p.m. comes earlier than you think, and you missed 
the “Fast and the Furious” casting call by 12 years. 
And in dead-ass last place, with a piss-poor record of 3-5 
is the Palm Beach Post’s Jason “The ladies like ‘em pale” Lies-
er, who brings an umbrella with him everywhere he goes not 
only to brace for unexpected rainstorms, but to block the sun and thus keep his complexion a ghostly white. I guess when you’re scrawny and 5-foot-5, it’s important to preserve the 
total package by making sure you don’t get a tan. Anything 
to keep the ole’ ball and chain happy, I suppose. picks , from page 13FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 7, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 15

RBSS FSGators aim to start fast 
in SEC play, erase 2011 
opponent in just the second 
game of the season. 
  Florida hasn’t faced a con-
ference foe before Week 3 since 2004, when it lost 30-28 against Tennessee in the sea-son’s second game.
Wide reciever Frankie 
Hammond Jr. said he told Florida’s freshman to stay fo-cused and pay close attention to detail in the conference en-
vironment, especially one as loud as Kyle Field.
Focusing on communica-
tion and coming out of the 
gates strong will be critical. 
  “[Starting fast] is very 
important,” wide receiver Frankie Hammond Jr. said. “We deﬁ  nitely want to get off to a great start and just keep it 
rolling from there.”
  One of Florida’s primary 
focuses this season has been 
setting the tone early. 
  After a 7-6 2011, the Gators 
are looking to establish them-selves as a tough, physical team in the new year. 
  That mission got off to a 
poor start on Saturday, as four-touchdown underdog Bowling Green played Florida close into the fourth quarter. 
  “That’s one of those things 
all summer: We want to start fast,” Jon Bostic said. “We 
wanted to start fast last week. 
We got off to a slow start. Hopefully we can start a lit-tle better this week at Texas A&M.”
  The Gators showed many 
signs of rust on Saturday. 
  Florida committed 14 pen-
alties for 106 yards, the offen-sive line failed to get a consis-tent push on third-and-short, the defense missed tackles 
and both sides of the ball suf-
fered from costly drops.  
  Coach Will Muschamp 
knows how important it is to get those issues ironed out, or 
the Gators could very easily 
start SEC play 0-1. 
  “It’s a critical game for us 
to go on the road and play 
well,” Muschamp said, “to 
improve from Game 1 to Game 2, which we need to.”

When UF coach Becky Burleigh first 
watched Adriana Leon play soccer, she saw a 
relentless striker with a will to score.
Burleigh wanted her badly. Nearly three 
years later, Leon finally wanted Burleigh. 
Leon, a forward from King City , Ontario, 
signed with Notre Dame after high school. But after two seasons and a national title, Leon transferred to UF to play for Burleigh. 
The addition of Leon gives the Gators a 
proven attacking boost this season. 
“We recruited her the first time, and Notre 
Dame made a good offer,” Burleigh said. “For whatever reason, she chose to go there. I don’t know what she was thinking.” 
At Notre Dame, Leon took what she want-
ed. As a freshman, the Canadian striker led the Fighting Irish to an NCAA College Cup crown. In the title match against top-seeded Stanford, she came off the bench to score the game’s lone goal in the 63rd minute. 
“I wouldn’t say it’s the favorite (moment of 
my life),” she said, “but it’s up there.”
Leon had an increased role with the Irish 
in an up-and-down sophomore season. Of her 20 matches, she started 15 — eight more than in 2010. She notched six goals and five assists, but scored four of her goals in the season’s first five matches.
After Notre Dame fell to Illinois 1-0 in the 
opening round of the NCAA Tournament, she decided to transfer to Florida.
Leon declined to comment on why she 
chose to leave the Irish. 
Fighting Irish head coach Randy Waldrum 
also declined comment on the situation through Notre Dame's media relations office.
Burleigh said she doesn’t know why Leon 
left. 
“Those are questions she could answer bet-
ter than I can,” Burleigh said. “I’m just happy that she did (transfer).”
Leon said she always had Florida in the 
back of her mind during her recruitment. 
“Something about the Gators I like,” she 
said.
When Leon first practiced with the Gators 
on Aug. 1, she wanted to make an early im-
pression. At that time, she was also preparing 
for the FIFA U-20 Women’s World Cup with the Canadian team. 
Leon didn’t use her obligation to the Cana-
dian team as a reason to not work hard with the Gators during their training sessions, red-shirt senior McKenzie Barney said. 
“That would be a great excuse for some-
one to not really get involved with the team,”  
Barney said. “But every day, she wanted to do 
everything we were doing and get in the mix. And not only that, but she wanted to run the fitness test too, which we didn’t ask her to do. She felt like she needed to prove it in order to practice. That’s kind of carried through and in-creased as time’s gone on.”
Leon left Gainesville on Aug. 5 after the 
brief practice stint with Florida. When the 
Gators opened their season against Miami on 
Aug. 17, she was in Japan.
At the U-20 Women’s World Cup, Leon 
flourished on the field, but Canada failed to advance out of group play with a 1-2 record. 
In three matches, she recorded a hat trick 
and two assists. The three-goal effort came in a 6-0 trouncing of Argentina on Aug. 20. 
“The whole experience was amazing,” she 
said of competing in Japan. “It felt good to get some goals.”
 Canada was knocked out of contention on 
Aug. 27, and Leon arrived in Gainesville two days later. In three matches without Leon, the Gators went 1-1-1. 
The jet-lagged and sore forward had only 
two days to catch up on what she missed. But 
against top-ranked Florida State on Friday, she 
logged 57 minutes. She also played 63 minutes on Sunday night against FIU. 
In both matches, she recorded three shots 
— including a shot on goal — but no goals. 
“Not my best,” she said. “I really didn’t 
have a good couple of games. My touch was off. I was just mentally really exhausted. 
“It’s not even the system that you have to 
get used to. It’s more just playing with your 
teammates and getting to know what they do and where they like to be on the field.” 
While Leon was hard 
on herself about her play, Burleigh saw a lot of positives. 
“She gave some great balls that should have 
been assists,” Burleigh said on Sunday. “They were perfectly placed balls that we didn’t have the ability to get on the end of. 
“She hasn’t really been in our system yet to 
understand what we’re doing. And that’s go-ing to take a little time.” 
It may take Leon a while to adjust to her 
new team, but the Gators see the 5-foot-3 for -
ward as a game-changing player. Leon even 
sees it in herself. 
“I expect to be someone who’s going to im-
pact the team every minute of every game,” 
she said. “I expect to be starting to score some goals and setting up my teammates.” 
Leon should give UF an edge with her 
competitive nature and toughness. Barney summed up Leon with one word: aggressive. 
“She’s going to run through a wall for you,” 
Barney said. “She’ll do whatever it takes to score or get the ball back. At the end of the day , those are the players we want on this team.”16, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 7, 2012
