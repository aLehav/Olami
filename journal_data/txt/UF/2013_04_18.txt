E-Learning users will click a lot 
less after UF Information Technol-
ogy launches a new version of Sakai this summer.
The e-Learning system will be 
upgraded from Sakai 2.8 to Sakai 2.9 in early May, the morning after Spring course grades are submitted.
Douglas Johnson, assistant di-
rector for learning services, said his team is excited about the 2.9 up-
grade because the improvements are more exten-sive than those in the past.
“The 2.9 ver-
sion is much eas-ier for faculty and 
students to customize and make it their own,” he said.
Sakai 2.9 will have a new look and feel: The most-used tools will be instantly accessible, faculty will be able to randomly assign students to groups and the old features will be easier to use, according to the UF e-Learning website.
In 2012, 11,322 course sections 
were taught in e-Learning. Also,1,909 instructors and 42,465 students used the program, according to usage numbers provided by UFIT.

The 6 percent Florida sales tax cannot be 
charged on food products, but UF’s Provisions 
on Demand customers were paying a higher bill than necessary.
Chris Mott, a ﬁ  rst-year Ph.D. leadership 
development student, visited the Hub’s POD Market about two months ago and was taxed for his protein bar.He purchased a water bottle from the same 
POD Market about three weeks ago and no-ticed the tax again.
“That’s when I questioned the cashier 
who told me that they didn’t know why they charged tax, but that it was that way in all of the stores on campus,” Mott wrote in an email.
He said a little change can add up, so he 
emailed Gator Dining Services.
On April 4, Bill Zemba, resident district manager of Gator Dining, responded.
“We are checking with our tax folks to get a 
determination,” the email read.
On April 11, Marketing Program Manager Jill Rodriguez said the issue came from a cod-ing problem and has been resolved.
UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes said she 
didn’t know how long the added tax was in place, but Aramark should comply with all state tax laws.
Mott said he was stunned no one recog-
nized the illegality of the added charges.
“While there’s really no way to reimburse 
patrons for the overcharge, they’ve at least recognized the problem and put a stop to it,” he said.

During the March Click It or 
Ticket campaign, UPD ofﬁ  cers 
ramped up their efforts to ticket drivers who failed to use their seat belts.
Eighty-two seat belt citations 
were issued during the course of the campaign, according to an email from UPD Ofﬁ  cer Da-vid Watson.
Prior to the 16-day event, 
the safety belt usage rate sur-vey reported 93 percent. The post-campaign survey rate was 97 percent, he wrote.
Seat belt citations are more 
prevalent during the campaign, UPD Lt. Greg Streukens said. The goal is to have no viola-tions.
“It would be wonderful if 
there were no violators,” he said. “Unfortunately, with the busy lifestyle people have now-adays, it slips their mind.”
The Click It or Ticket pro-
gram’s visibility and enforce-ment is credited with helping increase national seat belt us-age. In 2011, usage was report-ed at 84 percent, and by  2012, it reached 86 percent, according to the National Occupant Pro-tection Use Survey. People who wore seat belts in the Southern states increased from 80 percent in 2011 to 85 percent in 2012.
The campaign is a collec-
tive attempt among the Florida Department of Transportation, the National Highway Trafﬁ  c Safety Administration and law enforcement agencies across the state. 
Nina Barker, interim direc-
tor for the Florida Transporta-tion Technology Transfer Cen-ter, said the campaign makes drivers realize the law.
“I can only hope that it will 
increase the compliance in Gainesville, and ultimately, that will save lives,” Barker said.
In Florida, not wearing a 
seat belt is a primary trafﬁ  c violation. Ofﬁ  cers can ticket a driver or passenger in the front seat for the sole act of not wear-ing a seatbelt.
In addition, most trafﬁ  c ac-
cidents occur a few miles from the starting point, Streukens said.
“On campus, because of 
slow speeds, most of our acci-dents occur in parking lots less than 5 mph,” he said.Click It or Ticket

MTV’s “The Buried Life” stars Jonnie Penn and Dave Lingwood, presented by RUB Entertainment 
and Hello Perfect, speak to students at the Reitz Union Rion Ballroom on Wednesday night.

Jonnie Penn and Dave Ling-
wood shared their experiences 
and advice to motivate students Wednesday night.
The two stars from the MTV 
series “The Buried Life” spoke to about 350 students at the Rion Ballroom in the Reitz Union. Re-itz Union Board Entertainment, which sponsored the event with Hello Perfect, paid Penn and Lingwood $15,000 to speak.
“We want to help other people 
do what we’ve done,” Penn said before the event.
He said one of the hardest 
goals they want to achieve is No. 100 on their bucket list: go to out-er space.
The two other stars of the 
show, Ben Nemtin and Duncan Penn, were not at the event. To-gether, the four have crossed off their bucket list goals such as breaking into the Playboy Man-sion and opening the 6 o’clock news.
“It’s all about enjoying the ride and getting the goals done, obviously as quickly as possible,” Lingwood said before the event.
Angela Ribbler, a 21-year-old 
UF public relations senior and Hello Perfect vice president, said she hopes students will be in-spired to re-evaluate what is im-portant to them.
Hannah Atkinson, a 19-year-
old UF environmental science sophomore, said she watched the show when she was younger.
“Having watched them in high 
school, [students] might have been inspired to do something on their bucket list because of what these kids have done and shown is possible,” she said. ‘The Buried Life’ stars speak to crowd of about 350 people

Just two drinks a day can put you at risk for 
developing alcohol-related cancer, and UF stu-
dents are brewing over the issue.
A new study led by the National Cancer Insti-
tute found that people who consume 1.5 drinks a day or fewer account for between 26 percent to 35 percent of alcohol-related cancer deaths each year.
Between about 18,200 and 21,300 people in 
the United States die of alcohol-related cancer each year, according to a study published in the American Journal of Public Health. It accounts for between 3.2 percent to 3.7 percent of all can-cer deaths in the U.S., according to the study.
David E. Nelson, director of the National 
Cancer Institute’s Cancer Prevention Fellow-ship Program and an author of the study, said although alcohol use can lead to cancer, it’s dif-ficult to pinpoint how.
“People seem to be unaware that alcohol is a known human cancer-causing substance,” he said. “There are a bunch of different hypotheses on exactly how it works, but no one hypothesis is 
going to work for all cancers.”
Russell Crowe, a 19-year-
old UF electrical engineering sophomore, said he knows the risks alcohol poses and choos-es to not drink it. He said he was surprised how the low 
number of drinks could lead to cancer.
“I know a lot of people 
who drink that much at least,” he said.
However, not all UF students are willing to 
sober up. Brittany Pendley, a 20-year-old UF family, youth and community sciences junior, said she drinks alcohol every weekend when she goes out.
“I’ve never seen any negative health effects,” 
she said, adding that she was also surprised by the results of the study. “One to two drinks — that’s not even enough for a buzz.”‘Having a few’ ups cancer chances

The first fireflies of the summer are 
appearing around Gainesville.
“Florida is a very dynamic state fire-
fly-wise,” said Marc Branham, a leader 
of UF’s Branham Lab, which studies fireflies and other beetles. “We have about 15 species in the North Central Florida area alone.”
Branham said the best time to see 
fireflies is in June, when the mating flashes are at their peaks.
However, Florida’s climate means 
they can be found in varying numbers throughout the year. A few species, including nonluminescent species, are more active in the winter but, due to multiple freezes, their numbers stayed down, Branham said.
“As a state, we have the highest 
number of fireflies of any other in the country, followed closely by Georgia,” he said.
Branham said increasing pesticide 
and mosquito-fog use, light pollution and lowering aquifers are possible con-tributors to the declining numbers.
Abby Noonan, a 21-year-old UF his-
tory junior, said she loves the fireflies’ glow.
“I used to catch fireflies at my 
grandparents’ house,” she said “They looked magical — like little stars in the 
sky until they flew away.”Fireflies few this summer

◗ STUDENTS FIND WAYS TO 
BALANCE SCHOOL AND WORK.
JACLYN ROSEN

Michelle Colomer said some days, 
she’s lucky to squeeze four to five hours 
of sleep into her busy schedule.
The 22-year-old UF history senior is 
taking 17 credits while balancing about 20 hours a week as a Papa John’s em-ployee in the Reitz Union.
“It’s pretty hectic to say the least,” 
she said. “No one wants to sleep four hours, but you have to do what you have to do.”
Colomer said she’s overworked and 
overstressed, but she’s not alone. 
According to a Harris Interactive 
for Everest College study, 83 percent of American workers said they’re stressed out by some aspect of their work. The study cited increasing workloads as one of the top concerns reported by workers nationwide.
Sara Martin, a health promotion 
specialist for GatorWell, said the end of the semester is a stressful time for stu-dents studying for finals or graduating, especially for those who work.
Martin recommends students find a 
way to balance school with work.
“Finding stress management strat-
egies that work for you and that you can use consistently creates habits and routines that you can use for the rest of your life,” she said.
Chelsea Bess, a 21-year-old account-
ing senior, is enrolled at UF while work-ing at 101 Downtown.
Bess has been working since she 
was 15 years old, and through her ex-periences she’s learned how to manage her time.

afford not to work,” she said.Study finds Americans

The majority of other UPD traffic campaigns 
are during holiday weekends and football sea-
sons because of the influx of people on the road.
“There is a very strong belief that seat belt us-
age does save lives,” Streukens said.
From 2007 to 2011, 53 percent of the 121,507 
individuals killed in car crashes were not wear-ing a seatbelt, according to a 2013 Click it or Ticket Fact Sheet from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.·         “Seat belts don’t cause injuries,” said Alex-
ander Wagenaar, an injury prevention expert for the UF Department of Health Outcomes & Policy.

caused by car crashes,” he said.ticket , from page 1

Manager for UFIT, said UFIT 
looked at the analytics for which parts of Sakai were used the most, and those numbers helped determine the changes.
“The user-friendly aspects 
are being done based on stu-dent usage, so if we can make it easier to find something with less clicks, then that is what we are going to do,” Gale said. “Sakai is only going to ex-pand.”
She said the trend in higher 
education is online, and the de-mand from students and legis-latures is to enhance and devel-op the online environment.
“In fact, last week the Flori-
da Legislature appointed UF to develop as the university that will be the vanguard for de-veloping online learning pro-grams,” Gale said.
Michelle Pruitt, a 22-year-
old UF international business first-year graduate student, said she is excited the new e-Learning will be streamlined.
“It’s so frustrating having 
to click five different links in Sakai just to get to the sylla-bus or submit an assignment,” Pruitt said.
Johnson said there are sev-
eral people testing Sakai 2.9 to ensure everything is running smoothly.
“We think it’s a huge step in 
the right direction,” he said.

UF students and Gainesville residents can cel-
ebrate Earth Day at the 35th Annual Farm and Forest Festival Saturday.
The festival, hosted by the City of Gainesville 
Parks, Recreation and Cultural Affairs, will be from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. at the Morningside Nature Center, 3540 E. University Ave.
Sally Wazny, program coordinator for 
Gainesville Parks, Recreation and Cultural Af-fairs, said unlike past festivals, this year’s event will focus more on the forest.
The festival will feature blacksmithing, wood-
working, cooking demonstrations and live ani-mals, Wazny said.She said the festival will also celebrate the 
traditions and cultures of the Native Americans who lived in the surrounding forests with feather painting and bow and arrow crafting.
Admission is $5 for adults, $3 for children and 
free for children 3 years old and younger.
Hollie Greer, recreation leader at Morningside 
Nature Center, said the festival will include envi-ronmental information to educate children.
“We’re trying to make it more of an Earth Day 
celebration and a celebration of the farms that re-lied on the forests,” she said.Festival to celebrate Earth Day

If passed by the Senate, a Florida 
ban on race- and gender-selective 
abortions will be enacted Oct. 1.
House Bill 845, also known as The 
Prenatal Nondiscrimination Act, re-quires abortion providers to sign an affidavit stating they are not perform-ing the abortion based on an unborn child’s gender or race.
Knowledge that an abortion is due 
to a child’s gender or race, or actively participating in that kind of an abor-tion, will leave the provider liable of a third-degree felony and up to a $10,000 fine, according to the bill.
A Florida House of Representa-
tive’s committee voted in favor of the ban, reaching a 10-7 decision this month. House representatives presented the bill for a third reading Wednesday.
“It’s a bill that would further 
limit people’s ability to get abortions in Florida,” said Kylie Lacusky, a 19-year-old UF telecommunication and history sophomore and an officer for Voices for Planned Parenthood.
In a 2006 Johns Hopkins Univer-
sity study, 42 percent of clinics that offered gender-distinguishing tests performed abortions for sex-selec-tion and nonmedical reasons. About half of the clinics, the study showed, performed the abortions based on “family balancing,” or choosing how many sons and daughters a family will have.
Abortion has been selective since 
the beginning of time, said Tania Studstilll, executive director of the Women’s Resource and Medical Clinic of Gainesville. Son preference is one of the most prevalent forms of sex or gender discrimination, which fuels the elimination of a female’s right, according to the bill. Race-se-lective abortion, an elimination of an unborn child because the child or a parent of the child is of an undesired race, is seen as racial discrimination, according to the bill.
Kimberly Glass, a 19-year-old UF 
political science freshman, said she supports the ban and that there is a greater focus on abortions based on gender rather than race.
“We can’t allow discriminatory 
behavior to perpetuate throughout society,” she said.Ban on race -, gender-
selective abortions reviewed

The UF Genetics Institute has 
discovered a way for some types 
of corn to grow in acidic soil.
UF School of Forest Resourc-
es & Conservation associate pro-fessor Matias Kirst and his team studied a genetic variation in corn and found some strains of corn have three copies of a gene that can help the plant tolerate aluminum.
Aluminum, an element abundant in acidic soil, is det-rimental to root growth, which makes it difficult for the plants to absorb nutrients and water. The studied gene stops the plant from absorbing the aluminum. 
Kirst said this discovery 
could help find a solution to worldwide hunger. Farmers who are unable to grow corn in areas with acidic soil would now be able to, he said.
With a growing population, 
there is not enough food to feed the world, said Don McCarty,  associate director of the Genet-ics Institute. The solution for this problem is to increase the productivity of agriculture.
“Corn is sort of a super crop,” 
McCarty said.
Thomas Burley, a 22-year-
old UF agricultural and biologi-cal engineering senior, said he thinks it’s great genetic research is revolutionizing agriculture. 
“This discovery will open up 
new possibilities for growth that will feed humans directly,” Bur-ley said.

Granta list cause for celebration, skepticism
This week, the prestigious literary magazine Granta 
announced the authors chosen to appear in its Best of Young British Novelists issue.
The great news is more women writers and non-British 
writers are on the list. The bad news is the contemporary lit-erary world is still overwhelmingly male.
The list of Best Young British Novelists, which consists of 
20 writers 40 years old and younger, has been compiled every 10 years since 1983. This year, the majority of the novelists on the list were either born outside of Britain or are children of immigrants, and 12 of them are women — compared to the six women on 1983’s and 1993’s lists and eight on 2003’s list.
Granta, ﬁ  rst founded in 1889 by students at Cambridge 
University and reborn in 1979, has published the early work of many writers who went on to great success: Ted Hughes, Raymond Carver, Sylvia Plath, Martin Amis and Angela Carter, to name a few.
“The list has come to be regarded as a bellwether in the 
literary world, since so many of the writers singled out at that early stage of their careers ... have gone on to great critical and commercial success,” according to an article in The New York Times. So basically, being picked to appear in Granta is a huge freakin’ deal.
According to the same article in The New York Times, 
James Freeman, Granta editor, maintained that the magazine is not trying to ﬁ  ll a quota.
“We just wanted to ﬁ  nd exciting writers, and it happens 
that the big storytellers of this generation are people with a very complicated sense of home,” Freeman said.
In an NPR article, Ellah Alfrey, Granta’s deputy editor, 
said, “The result reﬂ  ects a happy reality of the literary land-scape.”
Although it sounds nice, Alfrey’s statement is categori-
cally untrue. 
In March, VIDA, a grassroots organization for women 
in literary arts, released The Count 2012, a list of top liter-ary magazines and reviews and their ratio of male-to-female inclusion. The ratios run across varying platforms: male to female book reviewers, bylines, authors reviewed and an overall average. Granta’s overall ratio was 41-to-30 in favor of men. Harper’s overall ratio was 158-to-31. The Atlantic clocked in at 236-to-83, and the New York Re-view of Books at 652-to-165.
Alfrey’s “happy reality” of the 
literary landscape is nonexistent, even with the presence of hugely successful contemporary female writers like Joyce Carol Oates, Laura Kasischke, Alice Munro and 
Margaret Atwood — not to mention the rise of young writers Téa Obreht, ZZ Packer and others.
I could name drop all day, and I still wouldn’t communi-
cate how many phenomenal women writers contribute to the industry. So, why are they so underrepresented in reviews?
“To claim, as Granta does, that the best voices naturally 
rise to the top seems to trivialize how many real barriers there are in the literary world for women and minorities,” NPR reporter Annalisa Quinn wrote in an article. “Granta is ﬁ  lled with eclectic, lovely voices. But its editors do its con-tributors a disservice by implying that it isn’t much, much harder to achieve literary fame as a recent immigrant or as a woman.”
Unfortunately, big names do not equal big advancements 
for women in literature.
When I initially heard the good news that the fourth edi-
tion of the Young British Novelists issue contained twice as many women than the ﬁ  rst and second editions, it didn’t seem like a big deal. The New Yorker’s Top 20 Under 40 is evenly split between men and women, and the current New York Times Bestseller list for ﬁ  ction is ﬁ  lled with female writ-ers. In terms of commercial success, women are big-time banking. It’s easy, then, to forget that the writers enjoying critical success are mostly male.
Is Granta’s Best Young British Novelists list a break-
through for women and minorities? Certainly. However, the literary world, much like the tech world and the political sphere, has a lot of catching up to do.
Chloe Finch is a journalism sophomore at UF. Her column 
runs on Thursdays.Worked Up: 
Can this week pump 
the brakes?
When a lot of bad news happens in one week, it can be really easy to feel like like the world is out to get you. It makes us hyperaware of more bad things. 
There’s never a pattern until the human brain just makes one up.
Except this week is turning out to be a little scarier than 
most. 
On Monday, the Boston Marathon was bombed, an event 
that will surely continue to shape conversations in American politics and the press. 
On Wednesday, at least two more unexpected things hap-
pened.
One: The press conﬁ  rmed, unconﬁ  rmed and reconﬁ  rmed 
that authorities had made an arrest in connection with the Boston bombings. Reputable sources such as CNN and the Associated Press were cited on Twitter with that news.
Then, the FBI hosted a news conference — one that about 
1,000 reporters and bystanders attended — at Boston’s feder-al courthouse, where it was suspected the person in custody was being held. But, as the FBI pointed out, they had arrested no one in connection with the case.
“No one has been arrested in connection with the Bos-
ton Marathon bombings, local police and federal authorities said Wednesday after a spate of media reports indicated that someone was in custody and headed to court,” according to the Los Angeles Times.
That sounds like the big-time 24-hour-news-cycle media 
outlets; somehow they get caught up in the fact that there might be a break in the story instead of waiting for actual results. Jump-the-gun methods aside, the really weird part started soon after that announcement.
“We are evacuating the building,” members of the Boston 
Police Department told the crowd outside the courthouse at about 3 p.m., according to the article. “During the evacuation, vehicles from U.S. Department of Homeland Security pulled up in front of the building. Law enforcement ofﬁ  cers carrying long guns stood nearby.”
Basically, a bomb scare happened in the courthouse where 
the announcement was made regarding the Boston bomb-ings’ potential suspect.
Two: Poison-laced letters were sent to a U.S. senator and to 
President Barack Obama.
“The letters included the phrase, ‘To see a wrong and not 
expose it, is to become a silent partner to its continuance,’ and were signed, ‘I am KC and I approve this message,’” accord-ing to a Reuters article.
Both of these events wouldn’t normally create such a big 
scandal, but when they’re placed in the context of the other national events this week, it’s a little cause for concern. 
Not that we need to constantly fear or worry, but we wish 
that everyone would just calm down.
We, as a country, deserve a break. Give us a chance to heal 
and calm down before you start the next crazy scandal. It’s too much work to be so scared.

◗ IF PASSED, THE BILL COULD 
TAKE EFFECT OCT. 1.
IAN ROWE
Avenue Writer
Before I start this article, I want to 
tell you something: Going around and 
asking people if they’re familiar with “revenge porn” does not make you popular.
No, it does not make you popular, at 
all. There is a repellent effect equal to go-ing around and asking people if they’d like to be in a porn with you, which for them is just your way of asking indirect-ly, “Like porn? Let’s make one.”
But I digress.When I approached different men 
and women on campus about revenge porn, their reactions were more or less what I expected. 
Sophie Kim, a UF senior, looked first 
for an escape route before she turned back to me and answered, “Um . . . are you serious?” 
Kati Zagurski, a junior, asked me, 
“What is revenge porn? Is that, like, porn where people take revenge on people?”
Then, sophomore Lauren Holsinger just shouted, “Revenge porn?!” She oth-erwise had no opinion about the mat-ter.
The men’s reactions were markedly 
different from the women’s but identi-cal to each other’s.  
The first male I asked just laughed 
and said, “Revenge porn, yea!” The sec-ond succinctly said, “Revenge porn? Yea, dude.” When I asked if he thought revenge porn was OK, he told me, “Go for it, so long as you can’t see any-
body’s face.”
When I asked if I could include their 
names in the article, they both told me no for the same reason: “I don’t think my girlfriend would like that.”
For those of you who don’t know, 
revenge porn is basically the result of a bad breakup. 
The jilted ex digs up an old naked 
picture or a sex tape and then posts it online. (If you’re in a relationship and things have become stale, don’t make a sex tape. Instead, take a trip. Or, better yet, just break up.)
In the past, thanks to certain Internet 
protection laws like the Communica-tions Decency Act of 1996 and the Digi-tal Millennium Copyright Act, there was little anybody could do. 
Basically, they stated the content 
provider isn’t responsible for the images because they’re not the people who put them there. 
But Florida — Yes, our noble, phal-
lic-shaped state — is trying to pass a bill to fix that.
Although the bill does not state ex-
plicitly that it will, or can, do anything about content providers, it is taking steps to hold responsible the individu-als who post revenge porn.
So, to sum up, it’s like getting re-
venge for their having gotten revenge. Get it?
Any violator of, let’s call it, the “Anti-
Revenge Porn Act,” would be sentenced to five years in prison and required to pay a $5,000 fine.
This, of course, brings up the ques-
tion of what counts as pornographic im-ages and whether a buttcrack is equal in offense to a 30-minute video of “that one time we got bored in a cabin.”
In any case, my advice to any would-
be violators of this could-be bill is sim-ple: If you’re angry at your ex, and you feel like uploading something on the In-ternet, make it an eHarmony account. 
Punishing the punishers: Revenge porn

Gator alum Ryan Lochte has spent the past year 
winning Olympic gold medals, hitting up the Mid-
town scene in search of a lady friend and filming a 
reality miniseries.
The promo for his new show 
on E! reveals how America’s most eligible bachelor splits his time between Gainesville and Hollywood.
Lochte enjoys playing golf, 
setting fashion trends and mis-pronouncing common words. Plus, he’s prone to repeat the word “Jeah!” without reason.
The reality star says he wants to settle down 
and find the person he can spend the rest of his life with. So, we decided to give him a little dating advice by reviewing his past mishaps to tell him where he went wrong.
Rule No. 1: You can either be a reality star or 
date one, but you can’t do both.
Last August, “Love and Hip Hop: Atlanta” star 
K. Michelle admitted she and Lochte had a lot in common, but she couldn’t elaborate beyond their mutual physical attraction.
Rule No. 2: If she’s dating you for your fame, 
she’s not dating you for you.
November gave us rumors of romance between 
the swimmer and aspiring model Rachel Garrison. The rumors were confirmed as the two walked the red carpet arm in arm at the 2012 Golden Goggle awards.
Rule No. 3: You can’t date a girl who has better 
abs than you.
Earlier this year, friendship blossomed between 
the Olympian and Miss Universe Olivia Culpo — a fair match considering it’s hard to tell who has the better bikini body.
Rule No. 4: Keep it private: First dates shouldn’t 
be posted on social media.
The latest headlines to hit the tabloids claimed 
Lochte and Carmen Electra were getting close and comfy in a Hollywood nightclub. We like them as a couple, but we don’t like that they posted the pic-tures on Instagram and Twitter.
If Ryan Lochte can follow these four simple 
rules, we think he might find the one.
Tune in to E! for the premiere of “What Would 
Ryan Lochte Do?” at 10 p.m. Sunday to find out how his search for love turns out.What should 
Ryan Lochte do?

◗ THE RIDE IS FOUR MINUTES.
LISA RUDERMAN
Avenue Contributing Writer
Universal Orlando believes it has 
“transformed” the ride experience 
with Transformers: The Ride-3D.
The next-generation attraction, 
which is set to open at Universal Or-lando Resort this summer, will be nothing short of groundbreaking as ride-goers enter an action-packed ad-venture alongside Optimus Prime and the autobots in order to save mankind from the evil Decepticons.
Upon entering the top-secret head-
quarters, visitors will find themselves as recruits for N.E.S.T. — Non-biologi-cal Extraterrestrial Species Treaty. 
After receiving an unexpected mes-
sage from Optimus Prime, recruits are placed in the autobot EVAC and thrown into the middle of a battle. 
Guests should be prepared to enter 
a battlefield that breaks the bounds be-tween the virtual and physical world.
The ride, which is four minutes 
long, is said to feel like hours on an epic journey. 
The guests are placed right in the 
middle and face the characters at their full height — close enough to feel their breath, said Thierry Coup, senior vice president of Universal Creative.
Faithful “Transformers” fans will 
not be disappointed with the ride ex-perience: Universal’s creative team worked closely with Michael Bay in or-der to create an authentic experience. 
From the sets to 
the characters, Uni-versal has made sure to stay true to what people would expect from the films.
“We broke the 
mold and have tak-
en this ride to a new technological level 
in terms of blending 
seamless 3-D,” said Michael Bay, di-rector of the “Transformers” films, in a press release. 
Not only will the experience be en-
tertaining, it is also said to be record breaking.  
Coup said Transformers: The Ride-
3D is the first theme park ride in the world to use the Infitec 3-D technology that creates the seamless experience. It will also have one of the fastest build times in the history of Universal, with less than one year to reach full comple-tion.

The only way burgers could be more 
American is if the buns were made of apple 
pie and the cheese were made of freedom.
As a college town, Gainesville has a re-
sponsibility to provide people with ample burger eateries.
I’m not talking about McDonald’s and 
Burger King, with their limp, tasteless, ketchup-soaked “meat” cakes. 
Gainesville residents want delicious, 
mouth-watering burgers with premium beef and ingredients.
Best Burger VarietyRecently, a Red Robin restaurant opened 
in the Oaks Mall, adding some competition to the Gainesville burger scene. 
With an extremely varied selection of 
burgers that feature toppings like bleu cheese, jalapenos, fried onions and a ton of other customizable options, the raw origi-nal burger joint fares well for meat lovers.
Most fire-grilled creations revolve 
around a single patty with a side of steak fries. 
For a large chain, it’s one of the best 
basic-burger options in Gainesville.
Best Student-centric BurgerRelish offers a wide, sometimes out-
landish, variety of burger toppings, and its two locations are close to where university students tend to dwell — Midtown and downtown. 
Unfortunately, the burgers there are 
bland for my taste.
Best Classic PattyIf you don’t really care 
for frills on your burger, you should opt for the greasy, delicious burgers of Five Guys Burgers and 
Fries at its two locations: 4222 NW 16th Blvd. and 3310-B SW 35th Blvd.
These burgers aren’t made with fancy 
cheeses or sauerkraut. 
Two patties, free toppings and a bag full 
of fries are what make a Five Guys burger worthwhile.
However, keep in mind, it’s not the best 
place to go if you want to lose weight — a regular side of fries is about 1,000 calo-ries. 
But then again, if you’re eating a burger 
for health, you’ve got your priorities out of order.
Best Veg-head BurgerWhat about the the vegetarian options? 
Where can you find the best veggie burger in town? 
Just kidding, no one really cares because 
veggie burgers are practically a salad, and salad is rabbit food, and I am not a rabbit. Your Gainesville burger guide

Three words can sum up the 
growing trend of digital fabrica-
tion: This changes everything.
three-dimensional printing, 
or additive manufacturing, is the method of making a solid 3-D ob-ject from a digital scan or file.  
Using an additive process known 
as stereolithography, plastic or rub-ber is laid down layer by layer and held together by a support material, which is later removed.  
The end result is a 3-D figure 
printed to the file’s specifications.
It may seem like science fiction, 
but it’s a technology that’s being rapidly adopted throughout mul-tiple industries including at UF.
UF’s digital fabrication lab, the 
A2 Fab Lab, is a collaboration be-tween the School of Architecture and the School of Art and Art His-tory, and houses technologies in-cluding laser cutters, 3-D printers and scanners.
Three-D modeling is being ad-
opted by artists in every discipline, from sculpting to painting and is a trend that Jack Stenner, a School of Art and Art History associate facul-ty member in the A2 Fab Lab, says is here to stay.
“From an artist’s standpoint, 
some of the things that can be done with digital fabrication have been done manually for centuries,” Stenner said. “Now that we have the capability to digitize just about anything, it just makes more sense to do it using the computer.”
A2 Fab Lab Coordinator Mathew 
Chandler said the possibilities are endless.
“They’re 3-D printing parts that 
go in your airplanes, they’re print-ing entire cars from the engine to the actual wheels to everything. They’re 3-D printing chocolate, they’re 3-D printing organs, they’re 3-D printing everything,” he said.
But why use this technology 
instead of manufacturing meth-ods that have been in place for de-cades?
“They are now able to create 
things that are lighter and stronger than they ever could before. 3-D printing provides a manufacturing process that is different in extru-sion and mold making than other previous processes, so it’s better and more efficient,” Chandler said. “It’s really just going to transform everything.”
UF students outside the colleges 
of architecture and fine arts have the opportunity to embrace this emerg-ing technology through a School of Art and Art Technology course.
“The digital fabrication class 
started out only open to College of Fine Arts students and Design, Construction and Planning stu-dents,” Stenner said. “In the last year, we’ve gotten to the point where we can open it up to the whole campus.”For students who are interested 
in learning more about digital fab-rication but are unable to take the course for credit, joining the new Fab Lab Club is an option.  
Started last month by Chandler, 
the club is open to all UF students with an interest in digital fabrica-tion. The club makes  art to displa-yaround campus and functional items such as multipurpose eating utensils for the homeless.
“We’re just trying to use our 
technology to do cool, simple, easy things that are cheap but help other people,” Chandler said.

Fab Lab, digital fabrication class or the Fab Lab Club, visit www.arts.ufl.edu/aafablab/.

Dear Friend,
Welcome to summer in Florida: similar to the weather in 
hell. In case of emergency, rip off your sleeves or the lower 
half of your shirt. Only three things will save us all in the months ahead: crop tops, sleeveless shirts and short shorts. If you’re not wearing one of those items or less, call for help because you’re about to suffer from a heat stroke. I can’t even wear pants in the same room as my overheating com-puter anymore. Let’s also remember that sunscreen isn’t a joke. Not even great genetics will stop the sun from shrivel-ing skin like a little raisin. Apply sunscreen, hydrate and wear appropriate summer clothing — items half the size of any-
thing you’d normally wear. We’re in survival mode now.Dear Friend,
I’m sure he just thinks your dangly 
human parts are weird. I don’t think cats understand what fat is in our cul-ture. No cat paws away food and says, “No thank you, human. That’s enough carbs for today.” If it ever rejects food from you, it’s because it wants to hurt your feelings for no reason. Cats al-ways look adorable when breaking 
your heart into little pieces.Dear Mediocre Advice,
My cat laughs at me when 
I get changed. Do you think 
he thinks I’m fat?
Dear Friend,
Your boyfriend has poor sexual etiquette, 
or, as I like to call it, bediquette. Communica-tion can solve the majority of these problems. Let him know he’s not the only one who wants to climax. The great thing is that sex is not the only way he can give you what you want. I’m sure he owes you more than one orgasm, so you should get to decide how he is going to make up for them. Consider all of your fore-
play options, and choose wisely. Dear Mediocre Advice,
My boyfriend only lasts about 30 sec-
onds in bed. He doesn’t even seem to try to last longer or care about my climax. 
What should I do?Dear Mediocre Advice, 
Would it be appropriate to wear a mankini while I 
drive my car when it’s 100 degrees outside?

When Dan Quinn left Florida 
to join the Seattle Seahawks staff 
on Jan. 17, coach Will Muschamp wasted no time in naming a new defensive coordinator. Mus-champ replaced Quinn the same day with special teams coordina-tor D.J. Durkin.
Muschamp took more time 
to name Durkin’s replacement, announcing the hiring of UTEP defensive coordinator Jeff Cho-ate as special teams coordinator and outside linebackers coach on Wednesday. Choate is Mus-champ’s second new hire since the 2012 season ended.
Choate fills the vacancy left by 
former defensive line coach Bry-ant Young, who resigned from Muschamp’s staff on April 10.
“We are excited to have Jeff 
Choate join our staff,” Muschamp said in a release. “He is a high-energy coach, an outstanding re-cruiter and evaluator, and has a reputation as one of the top spe-cial teams coaches in the nation.”
Choate joins offensive coor-
dinator Brent Pease as one of two former Boise State assistant coaches on Muschamp’s staff. Choate spent six seasons on Bron-cos coach Chris Petersen’s staff from 2006-2011, coaching special teams, running backs, linebackers and nickelbacks.
After spending the 2012 season 
as Washington State’s linebackers coach, Choate joined coach Sean Kugler’s staff at UTEP as defen-sive coordinator.
“Coach Choate is the epitome 
of an energizer bunny. His mo-tor runs full 24/7,” Kugler said at Choate’s introductory press con-ference on Jan. 8. “He was prob-ably the top special teams coach in the country when he was at Boise State.”
Muschamp added in Wednes-
day’s release: “We are very much on the same page philosophi-cally.”
Choate takes over a special 
teams unit that ranked fifth na-tionally with six blocked kicks and punts last season. He will have the opportunity to work with Ray Guy Award finalist Kyle Christy as well as kick returner Andre Debose and one of the nation’s top gunners in Loucheiz Purifoy.  
“I’m excited about the oppor-
tunity to join the Gator staff and have the chance to compete at the highest level,” Choate said in a release.
“I’ve gotten to know coach 
Muschamp over the past couple of years and have a tremendous amount of respect for him as a coach and a person. I’m looking forward to continuing the great special teams tradition that has been established here and can’t wait to get to work.”

When Florida and Flor-
ida State met up at Katie 
Seashole Pressly Stadium on March 27, the two teams played eight innings before a winner prevailed.
UF and FSU needed only 
five on Wednesday.
The No. 3 Gators’ (42-5, 
14-4 Southeastern Confer-ence) offense came out in full force in an 8-0 run-rule vic-tory against the Seminoles (34-15, 13-2 Atlantic Coast 
Confer-ence) on Wednes -
d a y night at 
JoAnne Graf Stadium in Tal-lahassee. 
“Last time, we had run-
ners on base, we just weren’t able to get quality hits and score with runners in scoring position,” coach Tim Walton said. “It’s really nice to get production out of a lot of people.”
Florida State right-hander 
Monica Perry got the start for the Seminoles. Perry took the loss in the previous matchup, giving up the game-winning grand slam to Florida out-fielder Briana Little. Perry did not fare much better on Wednesday.
After Perry struck out 
the side in the first, fresh-man Taylor Schwarz put the Gators on the board in the second. Following a single by junior Stephanie Tofft, Schwarz launched a home run over the left-field fence.

I think were balls, and then she threw me that inside Florida

Forgetting that Carlie Needles was a red-
shirt freshman last season can be easy. 
With four freshmen and three transfers 
joining the Gators in 2012-13, she was often 
overlooked and lost in the shuffle.
But after suffering tears to the ACL and me-
niscus in her left knee while playing defense in a scrimmage prior to the 2011-12 season — an injury that cost her the entire year — Needles bounced back with an impressive first season. 
Impressive enough that coach Amanda 
Butler admitted she demanded too much at times.
“Sometimes I expect more out of her as if 
she’s got more years under her belt, and she doesn’t,” Butler said. “She just presents her-self that way.”
Needles expected to be a key reserve last 
season. But multiple injuries to the Gators’ 
backcourt forced her into an expanded role. 
She started 15 of Flori-
da’s 37 games and logged 26.1 minutes per contest — fourth highest on the team 
among regulars. 
She was also asked to 
contribute more offensively 
than originally planned. 
Freshman Chandler Cooper was expected 
to develop into Florida’s main three-point threat. But Cooper was limited to three games as she battled a foot injury. Needles filled the vacated role. She made 
63 of her 185 attempts from behind the arc — a 34.1-percent clip that was second on the team to Lily Svete — and finished the season aver-aging 6.6 points per game. 
“I matured a lot,” Needles said. “I was 
pleased with how last year went, and you can only build on that and get better.” 
Despite setting the program record for 
three-pointers in a game with nine during a 74-44 victory against North Florida on Nov. 19, Needles became better known for her on-ball defense. 
Butler was aggressive with her young 
team, employing a full-court press that forced 17.5 turnovers per game. Needles was often the catalyst causing opponent miscues. Guard looks to build on strong first season“We are very much 
on the same page 
philosophically.”

pitch,” Schwarz said. “That was 
my favorite pitch.”
Florida tacked on three more 
runs in the third inning to break the game open.
Center fielder Kirsti Merritt 
led off the inning with her fourth triple of the season, a long fly ball to deep right-center field. Senior Kelsey Horton, playing against Florida State for the fi-nal time, drove Merritt in with a single.
After Horton’s hit, Tofft sin-
gled to keep the inning going. Tofft and Horton each advanced a base on a wild pitch. Then, Schwarz delivered her third and fourth RBI of the game with a single up the middle that scored both runners.
Schwarz is 5 for 5 with two 
home runs, a triple and seven RBI in Florida’s past two games.
“I was just feeling really con-
fident in the box today and I was seeing the ball well,” Schwarz said. 
Horton drove in two more 
runs on a double in the fourth, extending the Gators’ lead to seven. Freshman Kelsey Stewart chopped a single through the middle of the infield to officially activate the run rule.
While Florida’s offense was 
scoring off Florida State pitch-ers, the Gators had sophomore Alyssa Bache in the circle. With staff ace Hannah Rogers strug-gling lately, Florida needed Bache to turn in a strong start.
The right-hander picked up 
her eighth victory of the season, surrendering only two hits in five scoreless innings. 
The sophomore relied on 
groundouts throughout the game. Bache struck out the first batter she faced, and then re-tired 10 of the next 14 outs on groundouts.
“I just wanted to get outs,” 
Bache said. “Coming from Ken-tucky and Mississippi State games, I was getting a lot of groundouts and my movement was really working. I was just trying to work on hitting my spots.”
Bache’s win gave Florida 11 
straight victories against Florida State and a sweep in the season series against the Seminoles.
“It was the first time I’ve gone 
to FSU and been able to have an outing like that against them,” Bache said. “It really felt good.”

“I love 
watching 
Carlie,” ju-nior guard J a t e r r a 
Bonds said. “Full-court pres-sure, I can’t do that. That’s what she brings that is special to our team.” 
Needles projects to spear-
head a deeper unit that will add Cooper and transfer Cass-ie Peoples next season.
“Being a point guard, you 
kind of have to have leader characteristics,” Needles said. “I pride myself on having leadership characteristics. I hope it carries over from this year, and I hope my team sees me as a leader as well.”
