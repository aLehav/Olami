It was a typical sweltering Sunday night in 
Midtown: People wiped sweat from their fore-
heads and fanned themselves with any ﬂ  at ob-
ject they could ﬁ  nd.
Frustrated people dipped out of a 10-person 
line in front of Balls, mumbling about the new, 
growing entrance line.
Long lines have become the new norm at 
many Midtown, and some downtown, bars. By the end of weekend nights, doormen will often let in only one person after patrons leave — sometimes after one and sometimes after 10.
Kyle Hayes, a regular Midtown visitor, stayed at Balls to get inside. He said the new wait to get in is better than a few months ago when Balls was a sweaty mass of people.
“It used to be that you couldn’t even move 
in here,” the 22-year-old telecommunication se-nior said. “You would just want to leave.”
This change resulted from more enforce-
ment and increased emphasis on safety, an effort spearheaded by the Gainesville Fire De-City cracks down on bar crowding

Some members of The Gator 
Nation are showing their support 
for President Barack Obama at the Democratic National Convention, including students watching the convention on their laptops and a UF employee who is attending for the political thrill.
Robert Prather, treasurer of Ala-
chua County Democratic Party and a UF employee, ﬂ  ooded into the crowded Time Warner Cable Arena alongside thousands of supporters.
The 31-year-old psychology re-
search programs coordinator said the excitement was too enticing to resist. He drove the eight-hour stretch from Gainesville and plans to stay put until Obama’s nomination speech Thursday.
“It’s almost irresistible for me to 
go to such a thing,” he said. “To say it’s an amazing opportunity to meet people is an understatement.”
He said he isn’t attending on UF’s 
behalf but he’s been talking with stu-dents who are tied to Gainesville by 
light wallets and heavy class sched-
ules.
“Frankly , it’s the students’ time 
now,” Prather said of the overall election season.
A few days before the confer-
ence, two groups of UF students arrived in Charlotte, N.C., with dif-
ferent purposes. One group of Col-
lege Democrat students visited for 
a gathering of politically involved 
students, and another group of stu-dent activists showed up to protest 
the Democratic Party.
A handful of students and alum-
ni with Gainesville’s Students for a 
Democratic Society went to the city Sunday to protest the DNC with 
a crowd of about 500 people. The 
group, alongside a group of about 
1,000 people, also protested the Re-
publican National Convention last 
week in Tampa with the Coalition to 
March on the RNC.
“We felt it was important to show 
that there were people out there Gator Dems gear up for

UF’s Travel and Recreation Pro-
gram isn’t full of hot air, but one of its 
Fall excursions will be.
A hot air balloon ride is one of 31 
adventures TRiP is selling spots for starting at noon today. Students can register until 5 p.m. at The Outﬁ  tter in 
the Reitz Union.
Although registration will continue 
throughout the semester, spots will go 
quickly today, said 19-year-old geol-ogy sophomore and TRiP leader Mad-
eline Job.“People start lining up at about 
11:30 a.m.,” she said. “They sell quick-
ly; it’s a constant ﬂ  ow.”
Prices range from $11 to $270 de-
pending on each trip’s activities, travel expenses and length, Job said. Multi-day trips average about $100, and day trips average about $30. Prices include 
transportation and food. About 10 peo-
ple and two leaders attend each trip.
Zac Serota, a 19-year-old industrial 
and systems engineering sophomore, went hiking on Cumberland Island 
with TRiP last year. He plans to regis-
ter for events this semester.
“The best thing about activities on 
the trips are that there aren’t usually 
too many things etched in stone, so to 
speak,” Serota said. “It is truly an ad-venture, but time is never wasted.”Registration for TRiP

 � THE EVENT FOCUSES ON 
RENAISSANCE MEDICINE. 
NOELIA TRUJILLO
Alligator Contributing Writer
Hogwarts may be the school of 
witchcraft and wizardry, but UF 
now features medicine and magic.
UF’s main Health Science Cen-
ter Library will host the grand 
opening of “Harry Potter’s World: 
Renaissance Science, Magic, and Medicine” on Thursday from 4:30 p.m. to 7 p.m. on its first floor. The event is free and open to the pub-lic.
The exhibit will end in early 
October, but the accompanying speakers and film series will run 
through Oct. 30. The traveling six-
panel exhibit explores the Harry Potter book series and its historical roots, according to the U.S. Nation-al Library of Medicine website.
Thursday’s event will feature 
science experiments by the Cade Museum for Creativity and Inven-tion and a meet-and-greet with 
the Quidditch club team at UF, 
said Hannah Norton, a Health Science Center Libraries reference and liaison librarian. Guests are encouraged to dress as their fa-vorite Harry Potter characters and participate in a costume and trivia contest.
Emily Troilo, vice president of 
the Quidditch team, said she is excited because the exhibit makes history more accessible by relat-ing it to pop culture — in this case, Harry Potter.
“The Harry Potter’s World ex-
hibit seems to be all about finding and exploring passion in what you 
do — be it academia or sports,” 
said Troilo, a 20-year-old English junior.
UF researchers, professors and 
experts from various U.S. institu-tions are scheduled to speak at var -
ious on-campus events through-out September and the beginning of October. They will cover topics 
such as representations of race and 
ethnicity, law, potions and herbs and literary alchemy.
Connie Mulligan, professor and 
associate chair of UF’s anthropol-ogy department, will speak at the “Modern Magic: Genetics in Medi-cine” event Sept. 25.
“I’m thrilled to be a part of the 
panel of scientists speaking at the Harry Potter event to convey the marvels and magic of modern day medicine to students,” Mulligan said.
The university will also screen 
the first and final Harry Potter movies, but visitors and attend-ees don’t have to be Potterheads to attend. The exhibit will include 
a variety of topics all Muggles — 
students, faculty and Gainesville residents — can enjoy.“Truly, some of the science be-
ing conducted at UF is every bit as 
miraculous as the spells and po-
tions used in Harry’s world,” Mul-ligan said.

Patrons hang outside the window of Midtown bar Balls on Aug. 22. Fire 
safety rules have kept bar-goers from crowding into the venues.
Students plan to screen the president’s speech on Thursday
who are opposed to both parties and wanted to protest both 
parties,” said Fernando Figueroa, a 22-year-old UF alumnus. “They’re basically another side of the same coin.”
Students from both sides of the political aisle took to social 
media to share their opinions.
On the Democratic side, Rachel McGovern, co-chairwoman 
of Gators for Obama, also visited Charlotte, N.C., this weekend to meet with other politically minded students and revel in the pre-DNC festivities.
“It was really inspiring to see everything get set up,” she said.
While classes and finances kept her and other students from 
staying to see the convention, they’ve planned a watch party for the president’s speech. McGovern said they’ll gather in the Reitz Union Matthews Suite at 7:30 p.m. Thursday to watch and absorb the moment.
“I think this will get people even more excited about the 
upcoming election,” she said. “There’s certainly no enthusiasm gap in our organization.”
Prather said he’ll be standing in the cheering crowd when 
Obama delivers his speech.
“It sounds melodramatic to say it’s historic,” he said. “But 
it is to me.”He said the students who want to be in the seats beside him 
but are stuck in lecture halls are at the convention in spirit.
“The cliche is students are our future,” he said. “In some 
ways, students are already shaping policies.”
Back under the shade of the Spanish moss-covered trees, 
UF student Democrats approached their peers — clipboards in hand — to persuade them to register to vote. Then they hustled to classes, knowing they’d be back in the sun with their paper -
work soon.
“People are pushing to get their homework done and get 
the president elected,” Prather said. “I don’t know how they have time to sleep, frankly.”

Earth’s future may be more than 30 mil-
lion miles away. At least that’s what NASA 
hinted at when it decided to move forward with its newest Mars discovery mission.
InSight, short for Interior Exploration 
using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport, will place the first “geo-physical observatory” rover on Mars in September 2016, UF announced Tuesday. A solar-powered lander will monitor the planet’s vital signs for about two years.
“We will greatly enhance our knowl-
edge of the interior of Mars with a relatively small amount of data,” said UF geological 
sciences assistant professor Mark Panning, 
a member of the InSight team.
Panning said the lander’s seismometer, 
an instrument that will monitor quakes on Mars, will allow scientists to learn the planet’s core size and whether it’s liquid or solid.
“A big part of how planets evolve is how 
they get rid of heat,” Panning said. “Inter -
nal heat is what drives what planets do.”
In 1976, NASA’s Viking Mission to Mars 
placed two seismometers on the planet, but equipment malfunctions kept most of the data from getting back to Earth.
“Seismometers are how we’ve learned 
nearly everything we know about the in-side of the Earth,” Panning said. “This is a 
chance to get data back from another plan-
et.”

Connecting to the Internet has been a 
hassle for students on the UF campus, but 
those not in compliance with the require-ments will soon have their connection blocked.
On Tuesday, DHNet Internet Services 
began to enforce all policies. People who want to connect to the university’s net-work must meet certain system require-ments, said Tracy Gale, communications manager for UF Information Technology.
The requirements depend on comput-
er brand and include mandatory instal-lation of antivirus software, a policy key 
and the latest version of Adobe Reader.
Students, faculty and staff received 
emails about the requirements, Gale said. 
“Last Thursday evening, we ran a re-port of who is using our wireless network, 
and a little over 1,000 users still were not compliant,” Gale said. “And of those us-ers, over 600 were Mac users.”
People who have not complied or have 
trouble connecting to the Internet after downloading antivirus software can go to the UF Computing Help Desk. Students like public relations senior Nichole Teix-
eira lined up Tuesday to get help. The 20-
year-old hasn’t been able to connect with her computer since classes began.
“I keep doing the automatic sign in, 
and it doesn’t work for me,” she said.
The other primary component of the 
new infrastructure on the network is making sure spam and viruses don’t af-fect the system, Gale said. 
The university’s network carries per -
sonal information about students, finan-cial records, research data and more — all of which could be accessed if the system was compromised.

Bars can be fined if over occupancy
partment and new fire marshal, 
JoAnne Rice.
Rice, a 22-year veteran of the 
fire department, was promoted to fire marshal June 27.
She said fire inspectors have 
been more present in the past 
few weeks so that her depart-
ment can warn bars early to keep their entrance numbers under control. Rice also has communi-cated more with the Gainesville 
Police Department, so the offi-
cers can keep an eye on the num-ber of people in the bars.
“We don’t want to catch peo-
ple doing anything wrong,” she said. “We want to see them do-ing it right.”
She said she and her depart-
ment haven’t done anything 
radically different since she took 
the job as fire marshal and is surprised by the sudden change in the overcrowding situation.
The bars are doing their bests 
this semester to keep their num-bers within the range enforced by GPD and the fire depart-ment.Keith Single, co-owner and 
manager of Salty Dog Saloon, said his bar is adhering to the fire and building codes, and that 
neighboring Midtown bars have 
been slapped with fines. Door -
men have received misdemean-ors for letting too many people 
in, he said.
“Nobody has been fined be-
fore the past few weeks,” Single 
said. “I’ve never heard of it hap-pening before this.”
He said he heard a neighbor -
ing bar, which he did not name, was cleared out by authorities last Friday, and all the patrons 
had to re-enter one-by-one to 
meet the occupancy require-ments.
Despite the handful of hor -
ror stories he has heard, Single 
said he has been surprised by 
the lack of negative side effects stemming from the new scru-tiny.
“People inside are definitely 
happier that they aren’t being choked out by throngs of peo-ple,” Single said. “It’s safer, and our sales haven’t been hurt at 
all.”Steve Maciejewski, event co-
ordinator at the Swamp Restau-
rant, said he also hasn’t seen a decrease in sales. But controlling 
the crowds and explaining to 
patrons why they can’t get into the bar has proven to be more of a challenge.
“When it’s chaos, we some-
times have to close the line so we can get an accurate count of who’s inside,” Maciejewski said. “But trying to convey that to a 
bunch of 21-year-olds is chal-
lenging.”
Michael Que, a hulking 
25-year-old bouncer at Salty 
Dog Saloon, has seen that chal-
lenge firsthand.
“People are more upset,” 
Que said. “If they see any room inside, they assume they should 
be able to come in.”
However, Que said he doesn’t 
hear much aside from some 
whining and grumbling.
“There’s only so much you 
can say to someone who’s 6-foot-seven and 350 pounds,” he said, pointing to himself.

Gainesville barbecue lovers will soon have the 
flavor of Central Florida at their fingertips when 
4 Rivers Smokehouse opens its doors on Archer Road.
The Winter Park-based restaurant chain, known 
for its smoked beef brisket and corporate philan-thropy, announced Tuesday that it plans to open its Gainesville location in Butler Plaza where McAl-ister’s Deli is now. The restaurant will open in the spring and will employ about 60 people.
“We’re hoping to take occupancy of the space 
March 1 and to open around May or June,” said John Rivers, founder and chef of 4 Rivers Smoke-house.
McAlister’s Deli will relocate to a space closer to 
Publix, he said.
The company chose Gainesville for its next loca-
tion, Rivers said, because many former employees and customers from Central Florida attend college in Gainesville.
“We already had some brand recognition,” Riv-
ers said.
The three other locations in Winter Park, Winter 
Garden and Longwood “predominantly employ college students, and some high school students,” Rivers said. Three of those employees will be the management team who will come from Orlando, and the rest, he said, will likely be college students.
Rivers said he believes hiring college students 
creates an opportunity to increase his brand recog-nition.“Each semester, all those students who do grad-
uate will take my brand to Tampa, Orlando, Atlan-
ta,” Rivers said. “It really gives me the opportunity 
to expand.”
Some UF barbecue fans said they’re excited to 
have another option for snacking on brisket and ribs.
“I’m a sucker for beef brisket,” said UF senior 
Kacie Pounds, 22. “If they can smoke it well and keep it moist, then they’ve got me.”
The 4 Rivers Smokehouse specialty is Texas-style 
smoked beef brisket aged for 30 days, Rivers said.
However, Morgan Kerr, a 20-year-old UF biolo-
gy junior, said adding another restaurant to the city could overcrowd an already-competitive market.
“We do have pretty good barbecue places in this 
area already,” she said.
Pounds said a new barbecue restaurant is likely 
to face fierce competition, but that the biggest factor to a new restaurant’s success is a convenient loca-tion.
Unlike some of its competitors, the restaurant 
doesn’t serve alcohol. But Rivers said customers can bring in their own beer and wine.
“It’ll be nice to have a B.Y .O.B. place in 
Gainesville,” said Julius Finney , a 25-year-old UF senior. “It’ll bring a little big-city flair.”4 Rivers Smokehouse brings

Why everyone should 
focus on normality
Hey, how do we meet new people?
People who we would want to date, speciﬁ  cally.
We’re usually too concerned with learning and try-
ing to stay awake in class to meet anyone there, and we try to avoid people at the gym because no one wants to be bothered 
when they’re wearing sweaty workout clothes.
We meet people at our workplaces, but that’s mostly because 
we see them every day, so it would behoove us to make nice 
with them.
It must be nice to be Tom Cruise, because the Church of Sci-
entology will audition multiple women for your perusal.
Recent reports say that in 2004, women were brought through 
Cruise’s camp to see if they were marriage material. 
One of those women was actress Nazanin Boniadi.
An article from Vanity Fair tells us: “Initially she was told 
only that she had been selected for a very important mission. 
In a month-long preparation in October 2004, she was audited every day, a process in which she told a high-ranking Scientol-ogy ofﬁ  cial her innermost secrets and every detail of her sex life. Boniadi allegedly was told to lose her braces, her red highlights and her boyfriend.”
Though the couple dated from November 2004 to January 
2005, she was not found adequate enough to wed. 
The magazine says Boniadi broke down after their relation-
ship fell apart. When a friend “asked why she was crying all the time,” Boniadi broke down and told her about her relationship with Cruise, which she had been forbidden to do. According to the source, the friend reported her. Boniadi’s punishment was to scrub toilets with a toothbrush, clean bathroom tiles with acid and dig ditches in the middle of the night.”
Obviously the church denied any involvement. A Scientology spokesperson said that the church “does not 
punish people, especially in [that] manner.”
But Paul Haggis, a longtime friend of Boniadi, conﬁ  rmed that 
the rumors were true. “I would like to say that I don’t know how its members, many of them good and intelligent people, can re-main so purposely blind when they are faced with evidence like this every day, but then I am no one to talk,” Haggis told Show-biz411, a gossip website. “I was happily blind for many years, so I know the shame that Naz feels.”
What kind of a world do we live in where celebrities follow 
the leaders and teachings of that treat people like this?
More important, why should we care what actors and ac-
tresses do with their spare time? 
Because there may be cultures out there that approach dating 
differently than we do.
Because when role models are auditioning women to play 
the part of “Wife No. 3,” maybe we should take offense that women are simply fulﬁ  lling a placeholder ideal.
Because if the standards Hollywood couples hold themselves 
to, and expect us to follow, are not based on real feelings, then the rest of us don’t stand much of a chance until we realize that we are not the crazy and privileged. We have to actually work at this stuff.Polarization on the issues harms voters
We have reached a critical stage in our nation’s history. Facing a slow recovery from the Great Recession, and a nearly insurmountable debt cri-
sis, the time is rapidly approaching for America to make a choice about its current and future direction.
Regardless of the winner of the presidential election, it 
seems highly unlikely that a quick resolution is in order.
At this point, it is about two months prior to Election 
Day, and each candidate has already, or currently is deﬁ  n-ing himself to the American people at his party’s conven-tion.  
In an era marked with wide ideological divisions 
among congressional leadership and a record-low ap-proval rate, Washington, D.C., remains partisan with 
polarizing views, making it difﬁ  cult at best to the pass 
high-impact legislation that the American people are call-ing for.  
President Obama or Gov. Romney will struggle to ful-
ﬁ  ll campaign promises if Congress remains divided.  At this point, it seems unlikely that one party will control Congress. Therefore, whoever is head of the executive branch will struggle to reach a consensus among political leaders and thus will be required to compromise.
President Andrew Jackson once said, “To the victor 
goes the spoils.”
In the case of this election, neither Obama nor Romney 
will see the spoils of victory due to the hyper-partisanship of Washington, D.C. Throughout the Great Recession, group polarization has taken affront, thus pushing con-servatives farther to the right and liberals farther to the left of the political spectrum.  This ideological shift makes compromise difﬁ  cult, alienates voters and leads to an 
overall lack of progress that fails to address our issues.
As such, group polarization in our government has 
had a limited response to our most urgent problems — 
most notably deﬁ  cit reduction and job market  improve-ment.  With these major issues, it’s no wonder politicians are holding ﬁ  rm to their beliefs. With that being said, the blame game has gone too far, and any chance of compro-mise is insurmountable for all individuals involved.Recent political movements 
have claimed that we ought to return to our founding prin-ciples as explicitly presented in the Constitution.  Regardless of 
views on this standpoint, a re-
turn to our founding principles could assist in solving our coun-try’s problems.
Though not expressed in our 
founding document, President George Washington, in his farewell address, urged the American people to avoid po-litical parties.  In the present era, the campaign process is fully relegated to bitter attacks on the opposition instead 
of discussion of the issues. As such, tensions between po-
litical parties have become more severe since the develop-ment of social media, the Internet and TV .  As a result, progress has been inhibited as our elected leaders over and over again have failed to lead us. While the names have changed, the overall result has not. No major politi-cian is immune to succumbing to political games, as em-phasized by the development of fast-paced media.  
It is easier to blame the opposition than to develop bold 
solutions.
While I do not suggest the political parties be abolished 
or altered, party extremism, as established by group po-larization and spread by the media, encourages the hostile argument and bitter tensions that inhibit the development of practical solutions through meaningful legislation.
The road of extremes Americans have driven on will 
drive us to turmoil and has left the majority of citizens behind.  While the Founding Fathers did not always agree 
on the issues of the day, they called for America to avoid 
the development of deﬁ  ant and opposing factions of gov-ernment.  
The rise of extremism on both sides of the political 
spectrum discourages compromise between parties and harms the interests of the American people in general.

I’m not what many 
people would consid-er an avid TV-watcher.  
For reasons I don’t know, I completely lost interest 
in TV upon entering col-
lege.  After all, one can only watch the Disney Channel for so long.    
What I wound up 
watching for my grand return brought to mind one of the most critical epiphanies of my life.
I will refrain from revealing the program’s name 
for the sake of maintaining an audience, but I’m sure 
you’ve seen many like it: political talk shows, brim-
ming with masters of wit and elocution whose ability to sidestep logical inconsistencies make Usher look like William Hung.  
Within moments, their razor-sharp ideological ex-
changes can devolve into gloriﬁ  ed shouting matches of the rich and educated.
As I sat and watched round after round of this, I 
marveled at the blatant lack of understanding between 
the debators.
Surely someone would concede a talking point, ad-
mit to a fact error or somehow even agree with an op-
ponent, right?  
Wrong.Granted, these people are paid to spin their way out 
of an apology regardless which ﬂ  avor of the red or blue Kool-Aid they prefer. There’s a reason Fox News, CNN, MSNBC and the like stay popular and proﬁ  table.
Let’s face it, the yelling demagogues appeal to the 
dogmatic intellectual pugilist in us all.
To borrow from C.S. Lewis, pride is different from 
other vices in that it cannot tolerate its existence in oth-ers.  It is the one vice that all humans seem to have at least some measure of, and the more one has, the less one acknowledges it. The arrogance-induced drama on TV , and its inﬂ  uence on our country reminded me of the same drama that plays out in our lives constantly.
Pride kills. It assassinates marriages, poisons fami-
lies, sabotages businesses, corrupts kingdoms and in-stigates war.
Pride is blinding. It teaches us to ignore inconvenient 
truths ﬂ  ashing in neon lights, ruining relationships just to win an argument.
Pride emphatically condemns the “bastard” who 
gossiped about your dating habits, as it defensively ex-plains how your comments pertaining to your friend’s 
love life were misunderstood.  
Pride is insidious in others and understandable in 
ourselves. It’s what made the devil who he is.  
Make no mistake, we all have it.
My pride forces me to be better than others in the 
worst way . It constrains my ability to admit when I’m wrong and forces me to plow through others when they 
are.
What does your pride do? Some of us are absolute 
terrors to live with and be around, all the while think-
ing that we’re God’s gift to mankind.  It would be comi-cal if our delusions weren’t so devastating to the people around us. Ignorance on that level might make for a compelling villain in the magical realm of TV , but it makes for a pitiful human in the real world.  
It’s time we examine ourselves honestly.I’m not trying to be Debbie Downer here.I’m just someone who is compelled to address this 
sobering reality . In the weeks to come, we will delve into how to handle such issues of the mind and heart.
In the meantime, I must issue a bittersweet thank 
you to my last round of TV watching. Despite our best efforts to shift the blame to the “other” group for ac-tively destroying the country (and refusing to change the world), I know where the real issue lies.

opinions@alligator.orgThe people in the small town of 
Middleborough, Mass., popula-tion 23,116, decided they were 
fed up with the darned kids and their darned swearing ways.
With a vote of 183 to 50, the town de-
cided to give police ofﬁ  cers the author-ity to uphold a $20 ﬁ  ne for swearing in public to maintain “quality of life.”
Banning swearing in public may 
seem like a good idea, but it has no ef-fect on what is done “in private.” The townfolk of Middleborough are happy , especially because the delinquent teen-
agers cannot afford to pay for every 
swearword they say.
Nonetheless, as stated in a CNN ar-
ticle by Columbia University Professor John McWhorter, a columnist for the New York Daily News and contributing editor for The New Republic, this deci-sion is “like trying to put out a ﬁ  re with an eyedropper.” For one, police ofﬁ  cers 
cannot constantly monitor the public, no 
matter how much they would like to.
Moreover, there is no accurate way to deﬁ  ne what is profane. There is, realistically , no way to draw the line, which 
makes for messy enforcement at best.
Dealing with profanity is not new to 
the town, which in 1968 passed a pub-lic profanity law that made swearing a crime, but the police never enforced it. Nonetheless, creating a law to make it easier for police to reprimand offend-ers seems to be the obvious solution, at least to the town meeting voters.
The constitutionality of allowing 
profanity in public has been examined many times nationally. In 1971, in Co-hen v . California, the Supreme Court upheld the First Amendment rights of a man who wore a jacket stating “F--k the Draft,” deciding that “one man’s vulgarity is another’s lyric.”
Similarly , in 1776, Gen. George 
Washington ordered a ban on profan-ity in the Continental Armies. The law was seldom obeyed, according to TIME Magazine.
Profanity is not always protected by 
the First Amendment. Fighting words, true threats and incitement to violence do not fall under the category of pro-tected free speech — and for good rea-son.
Nonetheless, with profanity ranging 
from Kanye West’s “Gold Digger” and other musical hits to President Barack Obama asking “whose a-- to kick” in a 
2010 TV interview after the BP oil spill, 
the little town of Middleborough will have no means to uphold constitution-ality or to ensure the new law’s enforce-ment.
And while many are offended by 
profanity, it does seem to be increas-ingly prevalent in today’s movies, mu-sic, literature, television and society in 
general.
The First Amendment rights of each 
individual must be upheld above the 
discomfort of those who are offended.

Our country has a lot of problems. Despite what Repub-
licans have been saying, voter fraud isn’t one of them.
And that’s not what they’re worried about.
What Republicans are actually worried about is losing. It 
used to be a suspicion. Now it’s pretty clear.
Requiring voters to show photo identiﬁ  cation sounds 
completely acceptable. It would appear that every American should have a state-issued photo ID, but for whatever reason, many — 21 million, in fact — don’t. It’s important for every-one who is capable of obtaining photo identiﬁ  cation to do so, but sometimes it’s not that easy.
For example, 81 out of 254 Texas counties don’t have pub-
lic safety ofﬁ  ces that allow citizens to obtain a government-issued photo ID. This makes it more difﬁ  cult for the elderly 
and the poor, who are statistically less likely to drive a vehicle, 
to make it to their closest Department of Public Safety ofﬁ  ce.
The law does not require people to carry a photo ID, and 
therefore, it shouldn’t be a law to show one to vote. V oting is one of our most basic rights, and we should encourage new people to vote, not discourage the voters we already have.
It would be a different story if 
we had reason to believe that voting fraud was distorting our elections.
A report released last year by the 
Republican National Lawyers Association showed there were 400 nationwide prosecutions of voter fraud between 2000 and 2010. No state had more than four convictions of voter fraud during the 10 years, and 30 states had less than three convic-tions. It’s hardly an urgent issue.
It’s time that Republicans stop claiming (unconvincingly) 
to be the “defender of the vote.” It’s clear that Mitt Romney is not going to be the underdog everyone thought he was. Dem-
ocrats have no reason to feel comfortable during this election. 
So play fair, Republicans, and keep political agendas out of the legal system.

Hundreds of male students are hoping 
to go Greek this week.
Recruitment for UF’s 26 Interfraternity 
Council chapters started Monday and runs 
through Saturday night. 
Many aspects of the Fall recruitment 
process have stayed the same from year to year — potential new members check-
ing out houses, meeting brothers and min-
gling — but circumstances are changing in some chapters.
All the fraternities are using an online 
registration system to contact and keep track of rushing students, said Jorge San-
chez, IFC’s vice president of membership. 
This will allow the chapters to work to-gether and to later evaluate member data, 
which Sanchez said makes him optimistic 
for the new classes.
“I think this year we’re definitely going 
to be seeing record numbers,” he said.
Pi Kappa Alpha, which has been build-ing its membership back up since its five-
year suspension ended in 2011, is hoping 
so.“We’re feeling really confident,” Pike 
President Zachary Ryan said. “Hopefully we’ll be able to monopolize the best guys and get the largest pledge class.”
Meanwhile, Sigma Phi Epsilon lost 
more than half of its members during the summer. 
It went from 141 UF members in the 
past Spring to 57 members this Fall, ac-cording to the fraternity’s national web-
site. Jimmy Clements, the vice president of 
recruitment for the UF chapter, declined to comment.
Zack Kandel, recruitment chair for UF’s 
Phi Delta Theta chapter, said his fraternity wants to stay on par with previous’ years’ 
numbers. 
Phi Delt hopes to end up with about 35 
initiates.
The Theta Chi chapter also wants about 
the same number of initiated brothers, said 
recruitment chair Dylan Goldberg. 
But this year, the men are living off-
campus at Collier Hall while a new house is built on Fraternity Row. To help with 
exposure, potential new members can be 
driven to the house in a limousine.
“Sometimes when freshmen are rush-
ing, they never even hear about the off-campus houses,” Goldberg said. “We want to make it even easier for the guys.”

With the November presidential election drawing near, stu-
dents have plenty of opportunities to make sure their voices will 
be heard before the Oct. 9 Florida registration closing date.
Students can register to vote or request an absentee ballot 
through TurboVote, an online voter-registration service.
Christopher Montoya, a 21-year-old biological engineering 
senior, said he will use TurboVote to register.
“No matter what your opinion is, it’s important to voice that 
opinion and make something happen,” he said. “If you’re just sitting around and being passive, you have no reason to com-plain.”
Students can access TurboVote by logging into ISIS or visit-ing the website at www.ufl.turbovote.org/register.
UF College Republicans and UF College Democrats offer 
ways to learn more about each candidate.
Katie Shepherd, social director for UF College Republicans, 
said the club is promoting the campaigns on campus and urg-ing students to register to vote.
“I think more than half of college grads are unemployed 
right now. So it’s really important to let your voice be heard and get a candidate in there that can improve those statistics,” Shepherd, a 19-year-old biology sophomore, said.
Both organizations frequent the Reitz Union Colonnade and 
Turlington Plaza to provide information to students.
UF College Democrats runs a joint table with Gators for 
Obama on Turlington Plaza or at the Reitz Union every week-day from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. where students can register to vote, said Rachel McGovern, president of Gators for Obama.
Students fill out the registration application and Gators for 
Obama mails them to the Alachua County Supervisor of Elec-tions, she said.
Students must be registered by Oct. 9 to be eligible to vote 
Nov . 6, and those opting for an absentee ballot must send it by 7 p.m. Election Day, said Alachua County Supervisor of Elec-
tions Pam Carpenter.
“I am a firm believer in the old adage, ‘every vote counts,’” 
Carpenter said. “Whether you’re a student or the president, 
each vote counts equally , and the more voters we have the 
more influence we can have.”Voter registration services available to students on campusCHRIS ALCANTARA

Gainesville Police arrested a man ac-
cused of breaking into a tobacco store 
Sunday night and stealing synthetic mari-juana and cigarettes to pay for his drug addiction.
Police charged Larry James Owens Jr., 
43, of 413 S. Main St., with burglary, theft, possession of drug paraphernalia and possession of a controlled substance, ac-cording to a GPD arrest report.
At 3 a.m. Sunday , Owens broke into 
the Land B4 Time Smoke Shop, 107 N. Main St., because he was angry at the owner.
After he shattered the front door, Ow-
ens walked in and stole several packs of Newport cigarettes and more than 3 grams of fake marijuana, also known as “spice.”
When police arrested Owens at 5 p.m. 
Monday, Owens said he sold the ciga-rettes to fund his crack cocaine and spice addiction.
Police found two bags of spice and 
two glass pipes on Ow-ens. Owens said he was going to use one of the pipes to smoke crack, 
according to the report.
He added that the 
spice came from Land B4 Time, and that he was smoking it for the last day.
Police booked Owens in Alachua 
County Jail at 7:32 p.m. Monday with a $12,500 bond.

UF Supreme Court Chief Justice Matt 
Michel announced to the Student Senate on 
Tuesday that both referendums previously presented received the 500 signatures needed to be on October’s election ballot.
One asks if students want to rename the 
Reitz Union. The other asks if they want the university to proceed with moving all publi-cations into university-owned modular racks.
Michel said the court will convene next 
week to review the signatures and go over two petitions regarding election codes.
The Senate approved nine recommenda-
tions to the Senate committees.
But the recommendations for Alex Cohen 
to the Information and Communication Com-mittee and Danielle Lehrer to the Rules and Ethics Committee created debate.
Sen. Morgan Vollrath said both senators 
received recommendations for positions they did not apply to.Sen. Matt Pesek echoed his sentiments.“None of us are arguing that [Alex] is not 
qualified,” Pesek said. “We are arguing that he did not actually apply for the seat.”
Cohen said he did apply for that commit-
tee, but his application didn’t show it due to a clerical error.
Budget and Appropriations Chairwoman 
Christina Bonarrigo said that whether or not he applied, Cohen is one of the Senate’s most hardworking individuals.
“To sit here and discuss petty partisan poli-
tics is disgusting,” she said.
Bonarrigo also presented the 2013-2014 
Activity and Service Fee Budget, which totals about $18.2 million. The Senate will vote on it next week.

A billboard in northwest Gainesville 
sparked some pregame trash talk between 
UF and Texas A&M University fans Tues-
day.
The advertisement, north of the intersec-
tion at Northwest 13th Street and Northwest 
53rd Avenue, read, “Howdy Gainesville: 
You’ve been annexed by Aggie Nation. The 
Best Academics & Cleanest Program in the SEC. WHOOP! Real Football. Real Tradi-tion.” It caught the attention of several na-tional media outlets, including USA Today, 
ESPN and Yahoo! Sports.
The Gators will play the Aggies in their 
first matchup Saturday in College Station, 
Texas.
Jason Cook, vice president for market-
ing and communications at Texas A&M, said the university has no idea where the billboard came from.
“The billboard was not placed by Texas 
A&M University and is certainly not reflec-tive of how we’ve handled our transition into the SEC to date,” he said.
Cook said the university is “aggressive-
ly” investigating the advertisement.
A Houston-based media company pur -chased the billboard on behalf of “Aggie Nation,” said Jim Cullinan, vice president of marketing and communications for Clear Channel Outdoor. Clear Channel Outdoor owns the billboard structure.
Cook said that at 3 p.m. Tuesday, Texas A&M requested the company remove the ad due to trademark infringement con-cerns. Clear Channel Outdoor removed the ad later that day.
Although the buyers’ identities remain 
unknown, Cook said the ad’s word choice will help narrow down potential leads.
“The use of the phrase ‘Aggie Nation’ 
sends a strong indication that whoever 
placed this billboard is not affiliated or con-
nected with the university,” he said.
Texas A&M doesn’t usually use the term 
“Aggie Nation” to refer to its students and 
alumni, Cook said. It says “Aggie Network” 
or “the 12th Man.”
The billboard may have upset some 
Gator fans, but UF officials aren’t too con-cerned.
“I think this is some good-spirited rib-
bing, and we’ll see how things turn out on Saturday,” UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes said.
Rick Croft, owner of Texas Trailers across 
the street from the billboard, said a UF em-ployee recently pointed out the ad to him.
The billboard may be the first public jab 
by Aggie fans in Gainesville, but Croft said 
he doesn’t believe it’s a big deal.
“I think it’s good to have a little rivalry,” 
he said. “I hope we go over there and kick 
their behinds.”

UF’s Department of Recreational 
Sports has added belly dancing back to 
its weekly group fitness schedule after a 
one-year hiatus.
RecSports first offered belly dancing 
during the 2010-2011 academic year, but 
the class wasn’t renewed last year due 
to a scheduling conflict with instructor 
Paige Rechtman, a 27-year-old mental 
health counseling graduate student.
However, Rechtman’s class is back 
on the Fall semester schedule. The class 
meets at the Student Recreation and Fit-
ness Center on Tuesdays from 8:15 p.m. 
to 9:15 p.m.
“My favorite part of teaching the class 
is being able to be myself,” she said.
Pharmacy graduate student Ash-
ley Arenson, 23, was excited when she heard Rechtman would be teaching again this year.
“A lot of the moves are pretty awk-
ward the first time around,” she said. “But Paige is very encouraging.”
Arenson said she enjoys belly danc-
ing because it changes her workout’s pace. The time passes quickly, because students need to concentrate on moving individual muscles, she said.
Rechtman said the class also allows 
women to celebrate their bodies by moving in a way that is natural.
“Expect to be challenged and move 
muscles you’ve never moved before,” 
Rechtman said. “Also, expect to have 
fun and laugh at yourself.”Belly dancing classes return

Students in UF’s honors program 
will now navigate a point system to 
complete the program.
In the past, honors students were 
required to take four honors courses 
and participate in an internship, re-
search, community service or study abroad. Students entering the hon-ors college after Summer B 2012 will be required to graduate with honors from their college and earn at least 14 points for participating in both academic and enrichment activities.
“A lot of students … were find-
ing it difficult to find four honors courses that they wanted to take,” said Kevin Knudson, honors pro-gram director. “We’re looking to im-prove the number of students who complete the program.”
About 25 percent of students 
who enter the honors program com-plete it, Knudson said.
Activities are worth one to three 
points, and students will need at 
least eight academic points and six 
enrichment points.
Acceptable activities range from 
taking a course or completing a second major to participating in Florida Alternative Breaks or study-ing abroad. For example, a one- or two-credit course is worth one aca-demic point, and a semester abroad is worth two enrichment points.
“We’re optimistic that this will 
make it somehow easier for students to complete the honors program,” Knudson said.
Students who entered the pro-
gram before Summer B can complete the program with the old require-ments or the new requirements.
Hema Kher, a 21-year-old health science senior and president of Hon-ors Ambassadors, said she likes the diversity of activities included in the new requirements.
“It challenges students to get 
involved in more activities,” Kher said. “This will help fix the miscon-ception of the honors program being a two-year program.”
A full list of recognized activi-
ties and the associated point values can be found online at www.honors.ufl.edu/completion-requirements.aspx.

UF received $644.4 million in research fund-
ing during the last fiscal year, $25 million more 
than the previous year.
Despite the economic downturn, the univer -
sity’s 16 colleges received a total of 5,441 awards 
from the federal government, private organiza-
tions and industries, according to Joseph Kays, director of research communications.
Although UF received only $5.8 million in 
stimulus money from the 2009 American Re-covery and Reinvestment Act, and state and local funding dropped by 21 percent, fund-ing from industry and private foundations in-creased by 24 percent, according to a UF news 
release.
UF spokesman Steve Orlando said the fund-
ing increase is a testament to the university’s re-
search initiative.
“It shows our research prowess is being rec-
ognized more and more widely now,” Orlando said.
He also said a higher amount of research in-
come could positively affect UF’s presidential search.
More funding translates into more opportu-
nities for students, too.
“It really kind of excites 
a student like me who is in-terested in research,” said Bryan Stroud, a 20-year-old linguistics senior.
Some notable research 
awards UF received include $13.4 million for research to 
help elderly Americans re-main physically active, $5.6 
million to create biofuels from pine trees and $3.5 million to develop smart highway traffic systems, according to the news release.
David Norton, UF vice president for re-
search, attributed the success to the faculty.

a talented group of people,” he said.University continues to receive

FLAGGED 14 TIMES FOR 106 YARDS ON SATURDAY.

  Excuses will run out for the 
Gators when they face The 12th 
Man this weekend.
  Coming off an undisciplined 
season opener in which it com-mitted 14 penalties against Bowl-ing Green in The Swamp, Florida 
travels to College Station, Texas, 
on Saturday to take on Texas 
A&M in front of more than 80,000 
rabid fans at Kyle Field.
  The Aggies will be playing 
their ﬁ  rst Southeastern Confer-
ence game in school history, but the Gators said they’ve shaken 
off the ﬁ  rst-game jitters. While 
Florida played Bowling Green on Saturday, Texas A&M postponed its opener against Louisiana Tech due to Hurricane Isaac.
  The Gators took measures to 
deal with crowd noise and penal-ties based on their previous out-ing.  “(We’ve) got to be able to 
communicate through the crowd noise,” redshirt senior guard James Wilson said. “We’ve got to do away with a lot of the penalties that we had last week.”
  Florida ﬁ  nished last year as one 
of the nation’s 10 most penalized teams on a per-game basis and fo-cused on minimizing the yellow 
ﬂ  ags in the offseason.
  A constant stream of penalties 
Saturday puzzled coaches and 
players, including junior line-backer Jelani Jenkins.
  “Guys (were) excited, being at 
the ﬁ  rst game in the Swamp,” Jen-kins said. “I mean a lot of things carries into it. … We worked on it 
in practice and just didn’t show 
up.”
  Six came from the offensive 
side, including an illegal cut block from Wilson in the second quarter 
that left the Gators in a second-
and-25. Offensive coordinator Brent Pease said the three false starts were critical, but viewed 
the team’s two late-hit (Andre 
Debose and Lerentee McCray)

  During Florida’s game against 
Bowling Green on Saturday, televi-
sion cameras caught offensive coordi-nator Brent Pease yelling profanities after an unsuccessful play. 
  Although Pease was in the coaches 
booth and his cursing was inaudible, he apologized for his language on Tuesday, adding that he had to ex-plain himself to more than just the media and fans.
  “My mom let me know,” Pease 
said. “My mother said to be care-ful and I need to watch my mouth. I had my mouth washed out with soap when I was like 9. It’s not going to happen now.”
  Pease said he doesn’t normally 
think about cameras following him during games, and that repressing his emotions out in the heat of the mo-ment can be difﬁ  cult.
  Senior guard James Wilson said he 
was not bothered by it, only surprised Pease’s mother demanded an apol-ogy.
  “What coach doesn’t cuss?” Wil-
son said. “But he got caught, that’s 
horrible.”
    Handling the atmosphere: Texas 
A&M’s Kyle Field is known as one of the toughest road environments in 
college football, but the Gators aren’t 
worried about being intimidated by 
the Aggies’ crowd, also known as The  Pease sorry for swearingEND OF GREGULATION
  The Gators are choosing a conserva-
tive, run-based attack. They’re also choosing to ﬁ  nish 6-6. 
  Even under new coordinator Brent 
Pease, Florida’s offensive approach ap-pears to be the same formula fans saw last season. 
Run the ball, have the quarterback man-
age the game and play stout defense.  
  Alabama coach Nick Saban created the 
classic blueprint, and coaches across the nation have since been trying to emulate 
it. 
  As a Saban disciple, Will Muschamp ob-
viously wants his team to follow a similar 
model. 
All the signs are there: Florida attempt-
ed 42 runs against 21 passes in the season opener, Muschamp continues to preach toughness, and the conservative Jeff Driskel will start at quarterback.   There’s just one 
glaring problem: Florida still doesn’t 
have the person-
nel to successfully play that brand of football. 
  Maybe Mus-
champ will get 
there. 
Maybe with another successful recruit-
ing class or two the Gators will be a na-
tional power in the mold of an Alabama or 
LSU. 
  But right here and right now, UF isn’t 
ready to play and win with that style.  
The lines aren’t big enough, fast enough, 
strong enough or deep enough. The play-makers are average at best. 
  Pease’s arrival represented a chance for Florida’s cautious approach will 
result in ‘Eh’ or embarrassment

Redshirt senior Buck linebacker Lerentee McCray (34) committed a personal foul by roughing the 
passer in Florida’s 27-14 win against Bowling Green on Saturday at Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium.
“My mother said to be careful 
and I need to watch my mouth. I 
had my mouth washed out with 
soap when I was like 9. It’s not 
going to happen now.”

change given his history at Boise State. 
Perhaps the Gators would shift to a more pass-happy of-
fense or employ some gimmickry to try to top the power -
houses on the schedule this season. 
Don’t count on it. 
Sure, the offense will open up slightly as the season pro-
gresses. 
The Gators ran the ball on 66.7 percent of plays in the 
season opener, compared to 59.4 percent last year. For refer -
ence, Alabama ran the ball on 58.7 percent of plays — likely Muschamp’s target — and LSU ran it on 67.9 percent of plays in 2011. 
Regardless, UF will be nowhere near the 50.8 percent 
mark Boise State posted with Pease at the helm last season. Especially not with Driskel under center. 
By no means am I saying Driskel is a bad player, nor am 
I saying Muschamp was wrong to not choose Jacoby Bris-sett.
 I haven’t seen nearly enough of either player to make 
that call. 
What I do know is that Driskel is the more conservative 
passer, one built to manage a run-heavy offense because of his mindset and his mobility.We saw it time and time again last year, and we saw it in 
the first game of 2012. 
Driskel attempted 16 passes against Bowling Green. 
Only two of them traveled more than 10 yards in the air — a 
third-and-13 pass that sailed over Quinton Dunbar and a 
fourth-and-1 toss on a rollout that was far too low for Trey Burton, who was 14 yards downfield.
Brissett launched the game’s longest aerial pass attempt 
on his first play, misfiring on a 46-yard bomb to Andre De-bose after a play-action fake. 
In only five pass attempts, Brissett totaled two shots of 
more than 10 yards. 
Those deep balls create explosive plays, which give UF 
the potential to swing games and pull upsets. Without them, it’s hard to imagine Florida doing any better than last year, 
when it beat the teams it was supposed to beat and lost to 
the teams it was supposed to lose to. 
That means wins against Bowling Green, Kentucky, Lou-
isiana Lafayette and Jacksonville State, losses to LSU, South Carolina, Georgia and Florida State, and four swing games 
that determine whether the season is ‘Eh’ or embarrassing. 
Either way, it’s clear that Muschamp is sticking to his 
guns. For at least one more year, Gators will have to settle 
for average. 
Contact Greg Luca at gluca@alligator.org. and one illegal block (Wilson) penalties as a 
larger problem. 
“We’ve got to understand to be cleaner 
with their hands or cleaner with their blocks and do that,” Pease said. “We’ll get better at those. You go back and look at it. I don’t think the management of things or time (are) 
issues. I don’t see us having any of that. We 
had a good tempo and all of that.”
The defense didn’t fare much better, draw-
ing five flags for 26 yards. Junior cornerback Jaylen Watkins and senior safety Josh Evans 
said the issue isn’t anything the coaches can’t 
fix.
“We got a couple penalties where we were 
too aggressive,” Evans said. 
“There’s nothing wrong 
with aggression. That’s eas-ily corrected.”
Both the offensive and 
defensive groups have 
taken their own measures to deal with the recurring problem, with Muschamp saying he has exhausted 
every measure he knows. 
“I know when we go offside on defense, 
we personally come straight out of the game,” Evans said. “Obviously that affects the person. 
“(It) lets him know that he has to get his 
stuff together or he won’t play.”
Florida committed 16 penalties at home 
against Tennessee last season in its first SEC 
game and racked up 32 in a three-game con-
ference stretch on the road in October. 
“Obviously coach addressed it,” Watkins 
said. “You know we don’t want to go back out on the road like we did last year with penal-
ties and we had a hundred yards in penalties that led to a few scores too.”

‘easily correctable’Muschamp, Pease have coached at Kyle Field
12th Man.
“It’s really no different from here,” 
Wilson said. “We’ve got loud fans; 
they’ve got loud fans.”
Both Pease and Muschamp have 
coached in the stadium before. Mus-champ visited College Station as the de-fensive coordinator at Texas, and Pease coached in Kyle Field when he was the quarterbacks coach and offensive coor -
dinator at Baylor. Pease said some of the fan traditions can be disconcerting  if you pay too much attention to them.
“The thing I do remember is in the 
third quarter and you look up there and they’re all swaying,” Pease said. 
“You can’t look or you’re going to get 
like vertigo. 
“Those stands start moving. It can 
get loud. They’re into it and they get 
their little yell people going and all the 
kissing going on if they’re scoring. It’s 
a great atmosphere to play in.”
Purifoy working both ways: Sopho-more Loucheiz Purifoy will see time at 
wide receiver after earning one of the 
starting spots at cornerback to open the season.
Purifoy lined up at wide receiv-
er multiple times in the Gators’ win 
against Bowling Green on Saturday, 
and coaches say he will continue to play on offense.
While Florida’s wide receivers have 
struggled over the last two seasons, Pease said playing Purifoy on offense 
is a credit to his ability, not a response 
to the play of the other skill position players.
“It’s not an indictment on anyone,” 
Pease said. “We’ve done it everywhere 
I’ve been. We took the fastest kid and 
tried to use his strengths. He’s a very talented kid. They’re always eager to 
do it.  You’ve got a chance to catch a 
ball. It’s fun. They’re into it.”
Although he was primarily recruit-
ed as a cornerback out of Pensacola 
Pine Forest High, offense is not new to 
Purifoy. 
He also played quarterback and 
running back before coming to Florida, 
and Muschamp said the skills that al-
lowed Purifoy to succeed offensively 
in high school will translate to Pease’s 
scheme.
“Loucheiz is a guy that’s got good 
vertical speed and he’s got really good ball skills,” Muschamp said. “We’re 
trying to get more explosive at the 
position. He’s certainly a guy that can do some things for us, and that role 
will continue to grow as we move for -
ward.”

For McKenzie Barney, one of the Gators’ 
most experienced players, it’s all about be-
ing in the right place at the right time. 
Her college career has had its misfor -
tunes. But Barney, a redshirt senior for -
ward, has flourished on the field lately. In No. 24 Florida’s past three matches, she 
tallied a goal against Florida International 
and a game-winning assist against then-No. 2 Duke. 
Barney has not only stepped up as an 
attacking weapon, but as a team captain 
and leader for her younger teammates. 
“She’s never too cool for school for any-
body,” coach Becky Burleigh said. 
“She always brings a lot of passion and 
energy. People always listen to her. She’s 
kind of the ‘Let’s get everyone fired up’ type of person. She’s done a better job this year of knowing when that’s appropriate 
and when it’s appropriate to sort of get us 
to relax and play within our roles.” 
In 1,701 minutes in 2010, Barney tallied 
four assists and a Southeastern Confer -
ence-best 14 goals. 
But last year, Barney’s numbers plum-
meted to four goals and one assist as Bur -
leigh cut her playing time in half.
“Some people think that goal scorers 
like that are a fluke,” Burleigh said. “It’s 
not at all. It takes a lot of intention to do 
that. This year, she’s improved upon that intention.”
But in UF’s regular-season finale against 
South Carolina on Oct. 28, Barney suffered her worst fall. After sustaining a concus-
sion and facial fractures while going for a 
header, she sat out the postseason. It was her second season-ending injury. 
She suffered an ACL tear during the pre-season of her freshman year in 2008.“Probably the most frustrating thing of 
my life,” Barney said of missing the end of 2011. “That was my original class last year, 
so to go out that way was really hard and 
very humbling.”
After she suffered the injuries, Barney 
realized she needed to take advantage of her final season at Florida. 
“That’s the most motivating factor right 
there, other than the fact that these are 30 or so of my sisters,” she said. 
“I want to play for them, and I want to 
win for them.”
So far, Barney has matched her words 
with her play. 
Her 10 shots rank third on the team be-
hind senior midfielder Erika Tymrak (16) and sophomore midfielder Havana Solaun (12). 
She’s also had more of an impact, see-
ing her playing time increase to 62.2 min-
utes per game  — 19.1 more than in 2011.
Part of her resurgence has come from 
improvement on her checking runs, Bur -
leigh said.
“We’ve talked about her playing on a 
two-touch must, which means she must 
take two touches before releasing the ball,” Burleigh said. 
“That’s a good thing for her, because 
sometimes when she tries to play on one touch, she breaks down.” 
But another factor propelling Barney’s 
success has been timing.  
“The more she disciplines herself to get 
in the box and to be in the right place at the 
right time,” Burleigh said, “the more goals 
are going to come.”WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 5, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 15

Ziva Recek spikes the ball against Florida Gulf Coast 
on Aug. 25 at the Stephen C. O’Connell Center.
� THE OUTSIDE HITTER RANKS 
SECOND ON THE TEAM WITH 66 KILLS THIS SEASON.
JONATHAN CZUPRYN
Alligator Writer
After a pair of losses, the Gators 
found their silver lining.
The Southeastern Conference 
named Florida freshman outside hitter 
Živa Recek the Freshman of the Week, the first weekly award won by the 
Gators in 2012.
With coach Mary Wise’s previous 
starting outside hitter, Noami Santos-
Lamb, out for the season with a torn ACL, Florida’s coach has leaned on the 
6-foot Slovenian freshman to fill the 
void.
“The freshmen are going to play,” 
Wise said during media day on Aug. 
16. “They’re going to have to play and 
what we hope they understand is that 
they work hard and be patient until 
their time comes. 
“When your time comes, take ad-
vantage of it.”
The SEC named Recek the Fresh-
man of the Week just one day after she faced off against the Slovenian Junior National Team, which she played for in 2009. 
Ana Pehnec, a member of the Slo-
venian Junior National Team, played with Recek as a 12-year-old. She said she was proud to see how far her for -mer teammate has come as a player 
and person.
“She is extraordinary on the court 
and outside of the court,” Pehnec said. 
“She wanted to help me. She talked with me a lot. She taught me, really 
like, a lot of things. She plays here in 
a really great college, she told me she 
really enjoys people here. She’s happy 
here.”
“I chose the Florida Gators because I 
think it’s a great destination. It’s a nice campus, and they have a great volley-
ball team,” Recek said on the team’s 
media day. “The school is perfect.”
Recek tallied 10 kills in the Gators’ 
three-set sweep against the Slovenian squad on Monday. 
But Florida’s matchup against the 
Slovenian Junior National Team was only an exhibition.
Instead, it was Recek’s weekend 
against No. 4 Texas and No. 8 Stanford 
that earned recognition from the SEC. 
In the Nike Big Four Classic, she 
averaged team-leading marks of 5.64 
points and 5.29 kills  per set, statistics 
fueled mostly by her record-breaking 
performance against the Longhorns on 
Friday.Recek recorded 22 kills, which is 
now the highest kill output for a fresh-
man during a three-set match in school 
history. 
Her performance was also good 
enough to land her the third spot on 
the list of UF’s all-time kills totals in a 
three-set match.
“Živa was nothing short of sensa-

�UF RANKED NO. 113 IN RED ZONE 
TOUCHDOWN PERCENTAGE IN 2011.

  For last year’s Gators, the ﬁ  nal 20 yards 
proved the toughest.
  After the ﬁ  rst game of the 2012 campaign, 
Florida’s red zone struggles remain an issue.
  During coach Will Muschamp’s ﬁ  rst sea-
son in Gainesville, the Gators often failed to 
take advantage of possessions inside the 20-yard line. Florida found the end zone just 18 times in 37 tries for a 48.7 red zone touchdown percentage, which ranked 113th nationally.
  In Saturday’s season opener against Bowl-
ing Green, UF scored just one touchdown — a 15-yard Mike Gillislee run during the second quarter — in three red zone possessions.
  “Last year, we struggled a little bit in the 
red zone,” safety Josh Evans said on Aug. 15. “That’s one thing we can practice again: 
scoring in the red zone and stopping them 
in the fourth quarter. That’s one thing we’ve been focusing on a lot as a defense and an of-fense.”
  Despite their inability to score touch-
downs, the Gators still managed to put up points in red zone opportunities last season. Caleb Sturgis made 14 of 14 ﬁ  eld goals inside the 20-yard line in 2011.   Overall, UF ranked 
36th with an 86.5 red zone scoring clip.
  Perhaps the game that best epitomized 
Florida’s inability to score touchdowns in the 
red zone last season was a ﬁ  ve-point loss to South Carolina on Nov . 12.   The Gators drove inside the Gamecocks’ 10-yard line three times, but came away with only 12 points.
 After  Muschamp stressed red zone efﬁ  -
ciency in fall camp, UF showed no improve-ment in Saturday’s game.
  The Gators again turned to Sturgis to com-
pensate for their inability to cross the goal line, but he made only 2 of 3 tries. Muschamp suspected that Sturgis’ failed kick, a 27-yarder that hit the left post, may have been tipped.
  “We can’t settle,” offensive coordinator 
Brent Pease said. “We’ve got the best kicker in the nation, but we’ve got to be greedy . We can’t settle for ﬁ  eld goals.”
  As Boise State’s offensive coordinator 
in 2011, Pease rarely settled for three points inside the 20-yard line. The Broncos ranked eighth nationally with 74.3 red zone touch-down scoring percentage, and tallied the 
fourth-most red zone touchdowns with 52.
  The Gators’ 18 tied for 108th. From 2007 
to 2010, UF averaged 43.8 touchdowns inside 
the 20-yard line per season, reaching the end zone on 65.5 percent of their red zone trips.
  “We’ve got to be better at red zone oppor-
tunities,” Pease said.
  Florida has a prime opportunity to end its 
red zone touchdown futility in its Southeast-
ern Conference opener against Texas A&M. 
The Aggies return only four starters from a defense that ranked No. 99 in the NCAA by surrendering touchdowns to opponents on 67.4 percent of red zone opportunities.
  The Gators proved they could move the ball 
on the ground against the Falcons, but they may need starting quarterback Jeff Driskel to take on an increased role in the offense in or-
der to ﬁ  nish drives with touchdowns.
  “You’ve just got to be a good evaluator 
during practice and say, ‘OK, maybe it’s too 
much. Maybe we can go more,’” Pease said.
  Regardless of whether Florida is running 
or passing the ball, turning red zone posses-sions into touchdowns will be key in welcom-ing Texas A&M to the SEC.
  “That’s how you step on teams,” guard 
James Wilson said. “They’ll tell you, ‘Put the emphasis at the end. That’s how you win.’ That’s deﬁ  nitely our main goal: to score in the red zone.”
