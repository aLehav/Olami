◗ UF coach Will Muschamp is entering his first season as a
head coach , but don’t expect him to change his demeanor◗ People are overlooking the Gators this season, but linebacker Jon Bostic said that’s a mistake. He said Florida wants to avoid another slow start against FAU this Saturday.  GREG LUCA 
Alligator Staff Writer
As he patrols Florida practice, Will Mus-
champ personiﬁ  es intensity . 
  His presence constantly felt, Mus-
champ’s cries of “Lock in!” and “Pay attention!” — two of his favorites — reverberate through the ﬁ  eld. 
  During ESPN’s All-Access look into the pro-
gram, the Gators’ new head man stalks through a half-line drill in the ﬁ  rst week of fall camp. 
  The black whistle draped from his neck 
stands in sharp contrast to his white, long-sleeve T-shirt, and Muschamp puts it to good use. In reality , he hardly needs it. 
  He wears cargo shorts, white sneakers and a 
blue Florida visor, a workmanlike combination — nothing ﬂ  ashy. The power and command in his screams are the only attention-grabbers he needs. 
  As he shouts “Secure the football!” and 
“Scrape the C gap!” he demands recognition at all times, even as he moves between duel-ing groups of linemen, linebackers and running backs. 
  His style, although formulated under many 
inﬂ  uences during four years as a player and 15 more as an assistant, is all his own. 
  That’s just the man Will Muschamp is.   “I’m going to be me,” he said. “I’m going to 
be Will Muschamp. I’m going to be involved with the players. 
  “The players are a reﬂ  ection of their coach, 
and I hope they feed off the intensity.”
  
  The sidelines of the practice ﬁ  eld don’t 
bound Muschamp’s ﬁ  ery nature. 
  When John Brantley is in meetings or hang-
ing around the team facility, he can usually tell where his coach is. 
  “I’ve heard him through the doors,” Brantley 
said. “It’s awesome. It keeps everyone awake and in tune. Everyone is listening to him.”
  Muschamp isn’t shy about making noise in 
a meeting room. Whether it’s the safeties, cor-nerbacks, linemen or linebackers, he’s always animated when he’s working on the defensive side of the ball. 
  “The enjoyment I get out of coaching is sit-
ting in the defensive staff room preparing our football team,” he said.   That’s plain to see from his résumé alone. Af-
ter serving as a graduate assistant at Auburn, he coached defensive backs at West Georgia for one year, then did the same at Eastern Kentucky for another. From there he began a stretch of defen-sive coordinator jobs: one year at Valdosta State, three at LSU, one with the Miami Dolphins, two with Auburn and three with Texas. 
  As he bounced from place to place, he 
picked up new ideas and fresh insights on what it means to be a coach. 
  “Be a sponge,” Muschamp said. “Take it all 
in, and understand there’s different ways of do-ing it.”
  He’s learned from some of the best minds in 
the game. Bill Oliver taught him how to com-bine coverages. Nick Saban taught him total program management. Mack Brown, Wayne Hall and Roy Kidd added their own ideals to the mix, and close friendships with new rivals Jimbo Fisher and Derek Dooley helped drive it all home. 
  Muschamp soaked up every bit of knowl-
edge he could and let it marinate. The result was a defense guided to a top-10 statistical ﬁ  nish in six of his last eight college seasons. 
  As his football acumen developed and 
changed, Muschamp remained himself. Wheth-er he was screaming praise and encouragement from the sidelines at Auburn or chest-bumping defensive end Brian Orakpo at Texas, Mus-champ always maintained his excitable de-meanor.  
  And even Saturday, his ﬁ  rst game day as 
a head coach, there’s little reason to expect a change. 
  “He won’t be calm, and he never has been,” 
Dooley said. “I don’t think Will’s going to change. What you see is what you get, and that’s why Will has been so successful every-where he’s been.”
  
  
  Naturally, Florida’s new defensive playbook 
bears his signature. 
  The binder labeled “2011 Fall Camp De-
fensive Installation” is a monstrosity . A black, three-ring, 3-inch tome ﬁ  lled with 20 years of defenses. Three-down looks, four-down looks, nickel, dime — it’s all there.  
  The spine bears the owner’s name and a sin-
gle word: “Grind.” The solitary expression has become a team motto this fall, present in white, capital letters on the orange wristbands worn by every player. 
  The cover holds another simple message. 
“Lead the nation in: effort, toughness, turnover margin.”
  If a player doesn’t learn and adhere to these 
principles, Muschamp isn’t afraid to get on him. 
  And Muschamp’s forceful, commanding 
personality isn’t just directed at players. 
  “Even the trainers,” senior Chris Rainey said. 
“We just saw him yelling at a trainer across the ﬁ  eld, and everybody looked at each other like, ‘Wow. He’s the real deal.’”
  But Rainey also noted Muschamp’s lighter 
side, going so far as to jokingly call him bipolar. 
  The same coach who is doling out punish-
ment on one play can be laughing along with his players the next. 
  “He’s laid-back, but at the same time if you 
mess up, he’s going to let you know you messed up,” senior Jaye Howard said.  
  Muschamp’s passion reminds some of his 
players of their former coach, Urban Meyer. 
  Both Muschamp and Meyer are excitable, in-
your-face types whose love for football borders on obsession. 
  In his introductory press conference, Mus-
champ said his inherent drive forces him to work longer and prepare harder than almost anybody . This same characteristic forced Meyer into retirement. 
  But there’s one signiﬁ  cant way they differ: 
Meyer was an offense and special teams guru, Muschamp has always been defense ﬁ  rst. 
  “I love him, man,” Howard said. “He’s a mo-
tivator. He’s a defensive guy , and we’ve never had that here.”
  Said junior Omar Hunter: “He’s in the ﬁ  re 
with you. He’s jumping up and down with the defense and he’s talking about how bad he wants to beat the offense. It’s deﬁ  nitely better playing for coach Muschamp as far as offense and defense goes.”
      Even as a child, Muschamp’s aspirations 
were always a bit different. 
  In football games outside their home at 
1122 NW 22nd St., Muschamp’s brothers Mike and Pat dreamed of being Florida quarterback Wayne Peace or wide receiver Tyrone Young. But Will had other ideas. 
  Will Muschamp wanted to be safety Tony 
Lilly , who played at UF from 1980 to 1983. 
  Although he was born in Rome, Ga., and 
eventually returned to ﬁ  nish high school, Mus-champ spent most of his formative years in Gainesville and developed a love for Florida. 
  His family had UF football season tickets in 
the north end zone of what was then just Flori-da Field, where Muschamp saw greats like Cris Collinsworth and Wilber Marshall play under coach Charley Pell. 
  “I remember watching the games growing 
up and dreaming of being a Gator,” Muschamp said. 
  By all accounts, Muschamp was a stellar 
high school football player. But a compound leg fracture during his junior season diminished his chances of earning a scholarship right away , and he was forced to walk on at Georgia, giving up on his Florida dreams partly for economic reasons. 
  After recovering from an unrelated injury 
that forced him to take a medical redshirt as a freshman, he needed just one year to earn a scholarship. By his senior season, he was the captain of the defense.  
  Given his playing history , it’s not shocking 
that Muschamp now does much of his hands-on work in the secondary . 
  Senior cornerback Moses Jenkins said Mus-
champ might push the defensive backs harder than any other group, and sophomore safety Matt Elam lauded his coach for his interactive nature. 
  Said junior linebacker Jon Bostic: “He’s a 
players’ coach.”        
  With the pads on, Muschamp was a hard-
working overachiever. As a coach, he wants his team to inherit those values. 
  “That’s what I want us to be,” he said. “We 
are a blue-collar unit, and that’s what our iden-tity should be.” 
  He wants his team to share his character, 
and he’s always been real about who he is. He’s joked that he was never very good at English. He admitted that as a Southerner, he’d never live west of Texas or north of Tennessee. He talked about how his ﬁ  rst job out of school was at West Georgia, where he washed pants and lined the ﬁ  elds. 
  He’s been honest about who he is, where he 
came from, and how hard he had to work to get here. And his players love him for it. 
  “I am who I am,” Muschamp said. “I don’t 
really change for anybody.”

STORES UNDER INVESTIGATION.
MORGAN WATKINS

  Gainesville Police searched three local convenience 
stores Thursday as part of a months-long investigation into extensive food stamp fraud. GPD Cpl. Marc Plourde said the potential fraud could amount to hundreds of thousands of misspent dollars. 
  GPD issued search warrants for the following establish-
ments: the S.M.I. Food Mart at 404 S Main St., the Shiblu Kwik Stop at 727 SW Fourth Ave. and the 99 Cents and More Convenience Store at 1308 E University Ave.
  No one was arrested.  The searches were part of a covert investigation that 
is ongoing, said Plourde, the case agent for the investiga-tion.
  The U.S. Department of Agriculture and other agencies 
have also been involved in the operation, according to Cpl. Tscharna Senn, GPD public information ofﬁ  cer.
  The joint investigation centered on concerns that lo-
cal stores had fraudulently handled the Electronic Beneﬁ  t Transfer cards given to participants in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as the Food Stamp Program. For example, cards could have been accepted for items that aren’t permitted for use by govern-ment regulations.
  The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program has 
various regulations for the use of its EBT cards. The cards can be used for food items, for example, but not cigarettes, alcohol or prepared, hot food items, said Regan Hopper, spokeswoman for the Food and Nutrition Service of the  Gainesville Police investigate convenient store fraud

  UF administrators are considering 
abandoning  block tuition, and an an-nouncement could come as soon as Tues-day.
  Under block tuition, the university 
would charge a ﬂ  at rate for full-time stu-dents regardless of the number of cred-its taken. Currently, students pay by the credit hour.
  UF Provost Joe Glover said recent 
graduation rates factored into the decision to reconsider the controversial measure.
  For students who entered UF in 2006, 
the four-year graduation rate was 64 per-cent, a jump from 58 percent for students who entered in 2005.
  Glover said he is in discussion with UF 
President Bernie Machen about the issue.
  “[Machen] has told me he’s thinking 
about taking it off the table,” Glover said.  Student Body President Ben Meyers, 
along with Student Government and student activist groups, opposes the mea-sure.
  Meyers said Machen has been very 
receptive to Meyers’ concerns, and he 
hopes the proposal will be pulled Tuesday at a conference call of UF’s Board of Trustees.
  “Based upon our 
conversations, I would think that the proposal would be pulled,” 
Meyers said.
  The UF Board of 
Trustees approved a block tuition pro-posal in December that delayed imple-mentation until December 2012, pending approval from the Board of Governors, the state university system’s highest gov-erning body. The proposal was never sent to the higher board.  Block tuition may get nixedSEE COPS, PAGE 8

    On the ﬁ  ve-year anniversary of 9/11, UF 
assistant theater professor Tim Altmeyer 
stood at Ground Zero, no microphone in hand, reciting short stories about those who fell during the 2001 attacks.
  “We stood on the street, like street preach-
ers almost,” Altmeyer said. “It was like this one voice trying to rise above it all.”
  Watching the busy passers-by clad in suits 
in New York’s ﬁ  nancial district, Altmeyer was surprised by how many people stopped to listen.
  At UF, for the 10-year anniversary of the 
attacks, Reitz Union passers-by also will get the chance to listen.
  For a ﬁ  ve-day , 60-hour period starting 
today from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., volunteers will read 2,310 unconventional 9/11 obituaries at the Reitz Union Amphitheater. The readings will resume Sept. 6 to 9 after Labor Day.
  The obits come from the book “Portraits 
9/11/01,” which The New York Times origi-nally published shortly after the attacks in a series called “Portraits of Grief.” V olunteers will each take a 30-minute reading shift.
  UF College of Fine Arts Dean Lucinda 
Lavelli,  whose college is coordinating the event, is one of the volunteers.
  “This is a special thing that the arts are 
bringing to the UF community to celebrate these Americans who so unfortunately lost their lives,” Lavelli said.
  Altmeyer said the the readings humanize 
an event that has become political.
  “Hopefully as people are busying them-
selves in the Reitz Union they will stop,” he said.

“Oi ban cutlass.” 
It means “white man with the sword.”That’s what the people in the African 
village called Ben DeMarsh if they didn’t already know him as Ben.
DeMarsh earned their respect after be-
ing seen regularly walking miles in the summer equatorial heat, dirt-smudged and bearing his machete. 
This summer, DeMarsh, a recent UF 
graduate, spent five weeks in Njinikom, a village in the northwest English-speaking region of Cameroon with two other volun-teers. Cameroon is in west central Africa, just south of Nigeria. 
The three volunteers are members of 
Nourish International, a collaboration of university chapters that pairs schools with international developing communities.
In Cameroon, DeMarsh represented 
UF’s chapter. The other volunteers, Emily Salada and Christina Trevino, represented the University of Texas at Austin’s chap-ter.
They started a project called fruit tree 
cultivation, which was designed to pre-pare a plot of land where 5,000 fruit trees would be planted. They taught local wom-en how to tend the land and how to sell the produce for profit, creating jobs and a source of income.
It took weeks to clear the field and pre-
pare it for planting, DeMarsh said. Pro-ductivity was slow, and work had to be done before 3 p.m., when the torrential rains came in, right on cue.
“You might get one thing done in a 
day, and that was a big success,” DeMarsh said. 
Only the men used machetes. Consider -
ing he was the only male volunteer, De-Marsh’s work was cut out for him. With the field cleared and a greenhouse built for seedlings, supplies would be provided for the women, who otherwise had no access to jobs. 
They could then cultivate the land and profit from its yield.
Nourish International’s goal is to use 
university resources, like volunteers and fundraising, to start projects like this one in developing communities abroad. 
Projects can range from water treatment 
facilities to learning centers to land culti-vation. 
The purpose is to teach community 
members how to keep the projects running after volunteers leave the site. This not only creates jobs and income, it also cre-ates community empowerment, said Katie Conner, co-director of UF’s Nourish Inter -
national chapter.
“It’s a student movement pushing 
sustainable development,” Conner said. “We’re not going to be creating more need when we leave.” Conner and DeMarsh founded UF’s 
Nourish International chapter after taking a social entrepreneurship class together.
Despite the organization’s status as a 
newbie on campus, the team still managed to reach across borders right away. 
When a project in Swaziland fell 
through, UF contacted University of Texas at Austin’s chapter and hopped onto its project in Cameroon.
As for the chapter at UF’s future plans, 
no international projects are in the works yet. But the group is ready for new oppor -
tunities, Conner said. 
For now, it is focusing on recruiting 
new members. It currently has about sev-en, she said.
DeMarsh is continuing work with his 
contacts in Cameroon. He’s working on getting a grant for water tanks for the same fields he cleared this summer. 
Knowing expectations can sometimes 
exceed results, he’s approaching this proj-ect differently. 
“Solutions to those types of problems 
are more complicated than they seem,” DeMarsh said. “You need to just focus on one thing and do it well.”

When students vote in Student Govern-
ment elections on Sept. 27 and Sept. 28, they 
will get the chance to voice their opinions on UF’s recent tuition hike.Students for a Democratic Society put the 
referendum question on the ballot in hopes of rallying students to speak out against the 15 percent increase, said SDS member Chrisley Carpio.
A referendum question gauges student 
opinion on an issue.
The UF Board of Trustees unanimously 
passed the tuition hike in June. State legislators voted in the spring for an 8 percent increase and allowed individual universities to raise their tuition up to an additional 7 percent.
Since Monday, SDS members have col-
lected about 1,200 student signatures on Tur -
lington Plaza. 
SDS members will also hold an extended 
campaign to protest the tuition increase.  Carpio said the organization is looking to hold a rally around Sept. 17. She said the group plans to demand a meeting with administra-tors to discuss alternative ways of making up for the financial shortfall.
She said that many students’ scholarships 
are decreasing and that students are having to work harder to make ends meet.
“Education is supposed to be for the stu-
dents, right?” Carpio said. “It’s supposed to be accessible.” Student activists put tuition referendum on SG ballotCadets gather to show off

Clad in camouflage and dress uni-
forms, Army ROTC cadets endured the 
afternoon heat Thursday to take part in Operation Showoff, ROTC’s annual dem-onstration lab event. 
About 120 cadets from UF, Santa Fe 
College, St. Leo University and College of Central Florida attended the event on Fla-vet Field, according to Cadet Lt. Col. Eric Strnad, a UF criminology senior.
Cadets from Santa Fe, St. Leo and CF 
participated in all of UF ROTC’s Thurs-day afternoon labs, Strnad said.
Cadets climbed a rock wall and ex-
amined M4 and M16 assault rifles, which were left unloaded per campus regula-tions. They also learned about air defense artillery and checked out Humvees and a helicopter. 
Strnad said ROTC holds the event ev-
ery year to introduce new cadets to ROTC and smaller programs within it, such as Raiders and Ranger Challenge, two teams of cadets that participate in military skills competitions against other ROTC pro-grams.

Raiders and Ranger Challenge demon-strated their skills to the new cadets.
“We’re basically showing off every-
thing we can do,” Strnad said.
The goal is to make new students 
aware that the ROTC program is more than just a class.
“These groups are more than groups,” 
he said. “They’re almost fraternal.” 
Cadet 2nd Lt. Matthew Runnels said 
he probably would not have been able to complete college without the support of the ROTC program. 
Now a senior majoring in geography, 
he said he joined ROTC as a freshman for the experience.
“I never would have been skydiving; 
I never would have repelled out of a heli-copter if not for the Army,” he said.student lifeReader response

  Gamedays missing “Florida Boy” standard    
I spent my Saturdays last fall like everyone else: sweaty, 
jorts-clad and leaping into the arms of my buddies ev-ery time the Gators scored a touchdown. It was a great 
time. I mean, heck, we had to do something to get through another week of lectures. But there were times before, during and after the games when I would look around horriﬁ  ed — horriﬁ  ed at my fellow students who were stomping all over what I had previously thought was the reputation of south-ern  universities. 
  These weren’t the collared and khakied country-twanged 
gents of Alabama. Nor were they the ﬁ  ne diners at Ole Miss, famous for wielding silverware as they lean over their tail-gating feasts. No. My classmates were acting worse than, dare I say it, NFL fans. It made me think: Are we really the spoiled and spray-tanned brats who put in a backbreaking effort to win the title of America’s douchiest college? I’ll let you decide. 
  These are some scenes from the 2010 season:  After a bad call, a Gator fan drunkenly stumbles up onto 
his bleacher and shouts, “F—k you, ref!” down to the ﬁ  eld. Surrounding students chuckle to their friends. Others send the I’m-embarrassed-for-you smile his way. He’s decked out in orange and blue, his school’s colors. Gator logos ﬂ  ash on his shirt, his hat and his shorts. At the end of the game’s third quarter, he stands up and wraps his arms around his buddies to sing “We Are the Boys From Ole Florida.” 
  He’s dressed like one. He sings like one. But, he’s not a 
Florida boy.
  On their way home from the game, a group of Gator fans 
spies a truck ﬂ  ying green and gold University of South Flori-da ﬂ  ags from its windows.
  Middle ﬁ  ngers and insults come ﬂ  ying from the orange-
and-blue-clad horde as the truck passes. Passengers return ﬁ  re: “Your QB sucks!”   
  Another horde of Gators all called the fake punt that end-
ed in a sore loss against LSU. Their head coach was the only one who didn’t see it. But, on their way out of Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium, no doubt to drink away the replay , they put in their two cents. A wrinkled alumnus dressed in purple and gold and propped up on a cane stands with his mouth agape as he watches the stream of orange and blue pour down the ramps. They face the man’s family while they chant, “F—k you, LSU” over and over. The man grabs his wife’s hand, and, although they wear the victor’s colors, the couple averts their eyes and ﬁ  les away from the rampaging students.
  The Gator fans are on UF’s cam-
pus where they attend classes. They 
all have season tickets. But are they Florida boys? No.
  Another Gator fan is nestled under an awning on a game-
day afternoon with his closest friends, his favorite food and a cooler of ice cold beer. From his tailgate setup pours country music and the smell of hot dogs on the grill. A few Kentucky fans are walking by, in enemy territory. They send nervous glances at the party of Gators. One of them stops as a Gator says to them: 
  “How y’all doin’? You ready for the game?”  The Kentucky fans say yes, but they are still tired from the 
704-mile trip from Lexington.
  The Gator fan smiles. He invites them over for some small 
talk before sending them on their way with a few hot dogs. There is no sneering or jeering from anyone.
  Those are Florida boys.  I remember glancing over an old UF poster from the 
1950s, which has always stayed in my mind. It pictured a man in a tuxedo with a UF pin on it holding a door open for a woman or some other polite gesture. Scrolled along the top was something along the lines of “Women can tell a Florida boy when they see one.”
  I hope to see you all out there on Saturday . I hope we beat 
the stufﬁ  ng out of those Owls. But, when we do — and you know we will — let’s keep it classy. That’s all I ask. And you should ask this, too:
  Isn’t it time we all held ourselves to the “Florida boy” 
standard?
  Alex Orlando is the city editor at the Independent Florida 
Alligator.  This weekend kicks off college football season, and 
many of you have been preparing since before the start of 
classes. Whether you will be attending the game, throwing a kickoff party or going to a local hangout spot, most eyes in Gainesville will be on the game. 
But before you put on your orange and blue, paint your 
face and start ﬁ  lling your red plastic cups with whatever beverage suits your fancy, we have to end the week with our it’s-college-football-season-again edition of... 
 Darts & Laurels  
 This week, we will start at the top. We will be throwing 
an it’s-unfortunate-that-people-care-more-about-football-than-current-affairs-but-you-should-know-better DART at 
President Obama.
 The president tried to schedule his “jobs” address to the 
nation in the one time slot that happened to interrupt the next GOP debate. Now, he has moved it to another slot that will compete with the NFL season opener. 
How are we supposed to forget about being unem-
ployed when you interrupt our beloved football with some speech about a job-creation plan? 
But, there is good news in the world. The recipients of 
our epic-super-hero-strength LAUREL are Anthony Fis-
cher, Austin Kempf and Ethan Knust. These three high-
school football offensive linemen saved a pregnant woman who was trapped inside an overturned, burning pickup truck. That’s, right, these three brave heroes lifted and ﬂ  ipped over a ﬂ  aming pickup truck of death to pull out a trapped pregnant woman. 
What have you done today? Next, we throw a we-don’t-want-to-pay-higher-tuition-
either-but-holding-picket-signs-isn’t-going-to-do-any-thing DART to Students for a Democratic Society. And 
besides, as we reported this week, UF students are ranked third in the nation for the bang that they get for their tu-ition buck. So, the whole “fair-share” talking point isn’t re-ally going to work.
In other news, as the 9/11 anniversary approaches, 
there are a lot of people out there who are trying to re-member those we lost in different ways. That is why we are awarding our giving-a-human-face-to-tragedy LAUREL to 
Professor Tim Altmeyer. Altmeyer has planned to devote 60 hours over ﬁ  ve days to read the obituaries of those who lost their lives.
But some people just don’t know when to get out of the 
spotlight. 
This describes the recipient of our this-is-real-life-not-
a-movie DART to Steven Seagal. What did Mr. Seagal do 
to deserve this honor? He drove a tank into the home of an Arizona man who was suspected of animal cruelty. He also killed the man’s dog and his roosters. Yeah. 
Finally, we give a way-to-show-hospitality LAUREL to 
the restaurants that were busted last weekend for serving underage patrons. Your genorosity astounds us.

Check your chocolate
As another Halloween ap-
proaches and parents in the 
Gainesville area think about buying chocolate “treats” for children, here is something to consider: The chocolate you buy could be tainted with child la-bor.
Sept. 19 marks the 10-year 
anniversary of the signing of the Harkin-Engel Protocol — an agreement by the country’s larg-est chocolate companies to put an end to forced child labor on cocoa farms in West Africa by 2005.
Ten years later, not enough 
progress has been made. Hun-dreds of thousands of children are still forced to work under abusive conditions for long hours on cocoa farms in West Africa while others are victims of trafficking and forced labor.
The largest chocolate manu-
facturer in the U.S., Hershey, lags behind its competitors in eliminating these abuses from its cocoa supply chain. 
What’s more, Hershey has 
been exploiting student guest workers here in the U.S. in one of its packing facilities, accord-ing to activist organizations like change.org.
Some of Hershey’s competi-
tors, including Mars and Nestle, have committed to start sourc-ing cocoa that is independently certified to comply with labor rights standards.
I urge Hershey — the most 
iconic chocolate company in the U.S. — to protect workers from bean to bar and certify its choco-late as Fair Trade. 
Hopefully, this measure will 
ensure that forced child labor is removed from its chocolate bars, its Kisses and its peanut butter cups.
In the meantime, I’ll be hand-
ing out Fair Trade Certified chocolate to my trick-or-treaters this Halloween.

Letters to the Editor
The first time I chose UF back in 1986, it was a smart decision. 
At the time, I had just moved to Gainesville 
from our farm in New York. I was attending a private college in Buffalo where I studied advertising and me-dia. My mom got a promotion to the fiscal department at The Malcom Randall V A Medical Center. 
When she announced the news to the family , I 
thought, yeah, shorts all year round. 
I applied to UF and Santa Fe College and got into 
both, and because the College of Journalism and Com-munications was and still is renowned, I was thrilled to become a Florida Gator.
I had the time of my life here, working as the photo 
editor of the Alligator and then as a photo intern at the Gainesville Sun. 
I have moved 26 times since I left Gainesville.  I 
have worked as a photo intern at the Ann Arbor News and various Syracuse newspapers. After freelancing in Denver, I landed a job designing the Oakland Tribune.  Later, I became a high school teacher.  
You have met those people who lived here a long 
time ago and have come back to roost —  that’s me, too. 
I can’t quite explain how or why we come back, but 
I once wrote a feature about homing pigeons and their innate ability to return to the place where they were born. I wasn’t really born in Gainesville, but I certainly discovered who I am here. So now that I am home to 
roost, I thought I would share my top 10 reasons why it’s so cool to be older, wiser and back in school:
§ The youngsters give up their seats for me on the bus.
§ Sneaky smokers sitting in the outdoor amphitheater 
by the Reitz Union think I work here so when they see me, they run and hide. Then, I yell out, “Sir, this is a tobacco-free campus,” and they run faster. § Students whom I don’t know randomly wave at me 
because they miss their moms.§ I get all of my professors’ jokes.
§ I already own the movie posters of the flicks they 
show at the Reitz Union movie theater.       § My mortgage payment is less than the rent for one 
room in a four-bedroom condo at an all-inclusive apartment complex.       § The trees next to the French Fries have grown 20 feet 
taller since I graduated. Now, it doesn’t look out of place at all.        § I can sit in the alumni or the student section at foot-
ball games.     § No more relying on any rascally library coding sys-
tem to do my research, but I could if we lost electricity.§ Finally, I can still publish work in the Alligator.

“There is a certain population 
of people who need these food 
stamps,” Senn said. “They’re us-ing them in a way that’s counter -
productive for them.”
The stores were roped off 
with caution tape and closed to customers while officers con-ducted the searches. 
Other stores may be involved 
in the fraudulent practices being investigated, Plourde said.  
“All taxpayers contribute to 
the food stamp (program), so this affects everyone,” he said. “We hope by serving these search warrants today that it will send a message to other stores.”
The businesses, including 
their owners and employees, are under investigation. Retail stores must be authorized to ac-cept Supplemental Nutrition As-sistance Program benefits.
Members of the program may 
also be investigated because they are informed of its regulations when they are accepted into it, Senn said. 
The searches may help GPD 
discover the customers involved in the fraudulent practices, she said. Each card has a unique number that could help identify program participants who pur -
chased items from the stores.
Felony charges may be ap-
plicable, and the stores could be shut down, depending on the outcome of the investigation, Plourde said. 
This is the first time to her 
knowledge that GPD has dealt with a food stamp fraud investi-gation in Gainesville, Senn said. 
As of May 2011, 45.7 million 
Americans were accessing Sup-plemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits each month, Hopper said. Half of those re-cipients were children under the age of 18. It’s the highest amount of participation the program has ever had. 
In the 2010 fiscal year, states 
conducted 847,136 fraud inves-tigations regarding the Supple-mental Nutrition Assistance Program and disqualified 44,483 people, Hopper said. Over the past decade, 8,045 retail stores have been permanently disqual-ified for trafficking, which is the illegal selling of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits for cash.
A person’s eligibility for the 
program depends on various factors, including his or her in-come and the number of people in their household.8, ALLIGATOR §  FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 2, 2011

Gainesville Police officers searched inside the store and vehicles on the business’s properties for evidence in

Linebacker Jon Bostic and 
the rest of the Gators don’t care 
about their preseason No. 23 ranking, nor are they concerned about outsiders looking down on them following a disappoint-ing season a year ago. 
They’re just ready to finally 
take the field.
“A lot of people from ev-
erywhere are overlooking us,” Bostic said. “Everyone’s kind of like, ‘The forgotten Gators.’ … It doesn’t bother us at all. That’s how we’re trying to look at it.”
It’s not difficult to see why 
Bostic, a junior, and his team-mates feel slighted. 
After enduring a trying sea-
son in 2010, the Gators dealt with an overwhelming offsea-son.
They had to adjust to a new 
head coach, an overhauled staff, revamped offensive and defen-sive schemes, the transfer of their best player and cope with the stigma of an 8-5 season.
But when Florida takes the 
field Saturday night at 7 against Florida Atlantic in coach Will Muschamp’s debut, all of that will be behind the new-look Gators.
“There’s a lot of things that 
went wrong last year, but this is another year,” Bostic said. “A lot of people have changed what we did in the offseason, getting more focused for these games this year.”
However, several players 
admitted this week all the pre-season talk of change and fresh starts means nothing to the Gators if they struggle out of the gate like they did last season.
With a preseason No. 4 rank-
ing in 2010, expectations were high for a Florida team that made back-to-back Southeast-ern Conference title game ap-pearances and was two seasons removed from hoisting the BCS Championship trophy in Mi-ami.Like the Gators, this week is our first test of the season. We’re a young, inexperienced group 
with a little bit of upside. Everyone has been working hard all month, and we feel like we’re hitting our stride.
But until you actually enter the 
arena and compete, you still have doubt. The arena, of course, is the alli-gatorSports Brand Picks Column. The competition? Who can do the best. The reward? Well, being the champ has always been a good icebreaker at Midtown.
To kick off the season, we let two 
of our writers debate the Georgia-Boise State game. Here we go.
Boise State (-3) will eat all the 
Kibbles ‘N Bits on Saturday because …
There’s a reason the Bulldogs 
experienced a mass exodus during the offseason: You’d have to be Ray Charles to not see Georgia isn’t what it once was. 
The dynamic duo of Matt 
Stafford and A.J. Green couldn’t even save coach Mark Richt from falling to the proverbial hot seat.  Now, UGA is counting on a crop of inexperienced running backs — since Washaun Ealey jumped off the sink-ing ship and Caleb King flunked out — to help bolster an offense led by quarterback Aaron Murray. While Murray may turn out to be the best passer in the Southeastern Confer -
ence, he’ll still need that running game to create space for the receiv-ers and get the eighth man out of the box. 
And that’s where it gets ugly for  
Georgia. Only one back (Richard “Chunks” Samuel) has starting ex-perience, and the rest are extremely raw. Sprinkle in Boise’s run-defense (ranked 7th nationally in 2010) and it’s a done deal. Get out the shock collar because the ‘Dawgs will not be Picks

‘Forgotten’ Gators ready for opener against FAU 
UF sOCCeR
JOSH JURNOVOY
Alligator Writer
 
After a record four-game road trip to begin 
the 2011 season, Florida plays its home opener 
tonight against Texas Tech at home.
However, the Gators’ focus is not on the Red 
Raiders — it’s on themselves.
“We’re pretty much focused on profess-
ing what we are doing as a team,” said junior midfielder McKenzie Barney . “If we can hone in on that and make sure we are doing the right things, we can make sure that Texas Tech, no matter what they throw at us, it’s something we can handle.”
The No. 13 Gators (3-1), despite their solid 
start to the season, are not resting on their lau-rels as they head into their home opener.
Rather than dissecting the Red Raiders, the 
Gators have focused their energy this week on executing the game plan and addressing areas of their performance that did not meet their standards during the first four games of the season.
The Gators’ split their two games in Knox-
ville, Tenn., at last weekend’s First Lady V ol Classic with a 3-2 win against Texas A&M and a 2-0 loss to No. 6 UCLA.  While Florida head coach Becky Burleigh said there were positives to take away from the Gators’ weekend in Ten-nessee, she believes the games revealed areas in which her team still needs to make improve-ments.
Burleigh specifically mentioned reducing 
turnovers and the Gators’ defensive play as a team, not necessarily their back line.  Gators opponents had a total of 21 shots in their first two games, while Texas A&M launched 21 and UCLA attempted 19.
“To this point we have kind of focused more 
on offense,” said senior defender Jazmyne Avant. Florida welcomes Texas Tech for home debutsee FOOTBaLL, P age 14
see sOCCeR, P age 20“We’re pretty much focused on 
professing what we are doing as a 
team.”
McKenzie Barney
UF junior midfielderBut the Gators limped through 
their opener against Miami 
(Ohio) as the offense struggled, setting the tone for a lackluster year. There were errant snaps, Florida fumbled the ball eight times, and a passing offense that came in with high hopes man-aged a meager 113 yards. 
“It just killed the momen-
tum,” quarterback John Brantley said. “It just kind of sucked the wind out of us, I guess you could say. If you have good plays and something like that happens, it doesn’t kill our confidence, it just kind of sucks the wind out of us.”
With the team preparing for Saturday’s season opener throughout fall camp, the Gators know what they need to do to prevent a similar stumble out of the gates.
Muschamp has preached 
turnover margin, and sophomore Trey Burton said the team is looking to limit turnovers as well 
as penal-ties, and develop a good tempo 
in the debut of Charlie Weis’ of-fense.
“It’s real important to step on 
that gas pedal from the first play and just keep going,” Brantley said. “Don’t let off.”

After an offseason filled with both anticipated 
and unexpected change, coach Todd Morgan knew 
he needed to challenge his runners as soon as they hit campus.
For the first time in six years, the Gators have 
shaken up their schedule and will step out on the road for their first two meets of the year, starting with the Western Carolina Invitational today in Cullowhee, N.C. 
Both squads will run a short, tune-up style 
race, featuring a two-mile run at 6:30 p.m. for the women, followed immediately by a men’s 5k race.  Along with host Western Carolina, three other un-ranked teams — UNC-Asheville, North Greenville and Warren Wilson — will be competing against Florida.
“Coach (Mike) Holloway and I talked about 
running a little earlier to generate more focus and just preparation over the summer months, know-ing that alright, you report back and pretty quickly you’re going to be lining up and putting a uniform on,” Morgan said.
With last year’s top finisher Charlotte Browning 
out of eligibility, the No. 22 women’s team looks to lean heavily on resurgent senior Genevieve LaCaze and sophomore Cory McGee for leadership in the early meets.  
The returning duo is coming off a stellar track 
and field season in which LaCaze set the school record for the women’s steeplechase and McGee was honored as the 2011 Southeastern Conference Women’s Indoor Freshman Runner of the Year.
“We’re actually really lucky for Cory and I to 
have that kind of [track season] to get us rolling for 
fall,” LaCaze said. “We didn’t get to have Charlotte in the track sea-
son last year, so it was a little bit of a transition for us.”
The No. 26 men’s team is also 
looking to regroup after former UF runner Dumisane Hlaselo was kicked off the team for alleg-edly sexually assaulting a wom-an in June. Last season, the South 
African native was the only men’s runner to qualify for the NCAA Championship.
With the loss of their dominant runner, senior 
Josh Izewski said the squad’s chemistry and expec-tations have changed to more of a team-first ap-proach.
“With everyone working together like that, like 
not one person who’s trying to be it, you know it’s going to be better for when we’re out there and ac-tually on the course and we’re not worrying about ‘Oh, who’s going to beat who?” Izewski said.

— MATT WATTS
Georgia (+3) will stomp on that glass slipper well be-
fore midnight because …
This is a better breed of ’Dawg than the one we saw on 
the field last season. Murray is a year older, as is tight end 
Orson Charles. Losing Green is tough, obviously, but the cupboard isn’t exactly bare.
I know the old “This is the SEC, dammit!” line gets kind 
of old. But this is the SEC, dammit! You lose A.J.? It’s time for Marlon Brown and Tavarres King, both of whom were among the best prep receivers in the nation back when they signed.
These teams met in the season opener in 2005, and Geor -
gia made Puppy Chow of their competitor with a 48-13 win. Remember that game, Matt? You were, what? 35 years old? (Note: To understand that joke, you must know that Matt Watts is old. Like, really old. Really, really old.)
— TYLER JETT
Now, on to this year’s competitors:
From the Florida Times-Union, Mike “I’m sure you’ll 
have a great career … IN CANADA!” DiRocco, who irked 
a certain former Gators defensive end by insulting his (lack of) pass-rushing ability. Hint: the player’s first name rhymes with Puke.Next up, from the Associated Press, Mark “I should have 
gone the Van Wilder route” Long, who looked on wistfully with his 30-something-year-old eyes as a group of UF stu-dents prepared for a kegger Wednesday night. “That’s going to be a good party,” he told his Twitter followers. #Creepy
The 2009 champ is back in InsideTheGators.com’s Kyle 
“I wish the parachute failed” Maistri, whose eyes glazed over while interviewing college football players this week. The life of a beat writer and message board monitor doesn’t seem so fun after spending a Saturday jumping out of air -
planes.
Also joining us is Fightin’Gators.com’s Cody “Why isn’t 
Fredi Gonzalez listening to me?” Jones, whose career aspi-rations include a couch to sit on, a pair of Braves boxers to wear and a Twitter account used to fling 140-character insults toward the Atlanta manager. Journalism industry, meet the 21st-Century sports writer.
The home team is managed by alligatorSports editor 
Tom “START JEFFY DAMMIT!” Green, whose overwhelm-ing man-crush on Florida’s backup QB has taken an ugly turn. Instead of simple admiration, Green has stepped his game up. Rumor has it he’s flirting with walk-ons to get closer to his precious Driskel. 
The second in command is alligatorSports assistant edi-
tor Matt “Walk around the club, Watts everybody” Watts, whose name became a verb after a certain feature last spring. Watch out, Coach Boom, don’t scream at any players, Watts might try to get you axed.
Joining the column for once again is alligatorSports staff 
writer Tyler “It’s all downhill after 21” Jett, who celebrated his 22nd birthday by working in the office and playing with a big rubber ball. We Googled “Young Boy Balls” to find the toy’s official title, but the results weren’t what we hoped. Our names are now on a government watch list.
And, in dead-ass last place, if only by blind luck, is al-
ligatorSports staff writer Greg “What the hell is Pluto?” Luca, whose reaction to the celestial body’s demotion from planet-status proved to be pretty damning evidence against Connecticut’s public education system.

“Now is when we are starting to work on 
the defensive part of things.”
Avant said UF has placed a heavy em-
phasis on one-on-one defense in practice 
this week. 
She believes that if the Gators execute 
their defense in all of their formations, they can neutralize any Red Raiders attack.
While the Florida’s focal point this week 
has been sharpening their defensive play, Burleigh said that doesn’t mean they are tak-ing Texas Tech lightly.
“We don’t take anybody for granted by 
any stretch,” she said. “It is our first home game, and we need to defend our turf.”
But before the Gators can take the field 
tonight at Pressly Stadium, they will get to speak with a couple of former Gators who have some recent big-game experience of their own. 
Heather Mitts and Abby Wambach, both 
of whom are less than two months removed from their FIFA Women’s World Cup Final appearance with the U.S. women’s national team, will speak with the Gators prior to the game and sign autographs for fans after.
“Being able to get any sort of advice and 
inspiration from them is going to fire us up,” Barney said.BRYAN HOLT

Chanel Brown busted into college volley-
ball with a successful first season in 2010.
She was a Southeastern Conference All-
Freshman team selection, Florida’s primary 
setter and the team leader in assists per set.
But what gets overlooked is Brown was 
enduring a major learning process. Coming out of high school as one of the nation’s top outside hitters, the 5-foot-9 sophomore had never been a setter before.
“A very good athlete with a lot of tools,“ 
coach Mary Wise said.
“She just needed to refine those to play 
that position.”
Redshirt freshman libero Taylor Unroe 
got plenty of opportunities to watch Brown’s play last season while sidelined with a bro-ken bone in her ankle. She described her teammate as an energetic and talented play-er who was lacking confidence.
After an offseason of long hours in the 
gym, Unroe insists Brown is much im-proved.
“This year she’s very sure of herself and 
taking coaching a lot better,” Unroe said.
Brown’s freshman year was a challenge, 
although her stats might not show it.
“Coming in your freshman year, you’re 
just learning the whole aspect of the game and how fast paced it is, but now we’re in a  rhythm and just letting the offense come naturally,” Brown said.
Specializing in assists, Brown tends to fall under the radar while powerful hitters like Kelly Murphy , Stephanie Ferrell and Kristy Jaeckel soak up the attention. After opening the season with 54 assists in three games (UF has 110 total assists), she has im-proved in connecting with the Gators’ more celebrated attackers.
“Part of it is comfort, confidence,“ Wise 
said. “She’s taken a ton of reps setting the ball. … She was in here at noon [Thursday] taking extra reps.”
While the season has opened with suc-
cess, Brown and her teammates have the same goal — a national championship for a team that has repeatedly failed to take that next step.
The journey continues today at noon and 
7:30 p.m. as Florida hosts JU and FAU, re-spectively, on day one of the Campus USA Credit Union Invite at home.20, ALLIGATOR §  FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 2, 2011
