Facebook warned its users Fri-
day to refrain from giving login 
information during job interviews after hearing that some employers were asking interviewees to give them access to private information.
It is legal to ask for Facebook log-
in information, said Lyrissa Lidsky , professor at Levin College of Law.
She said giving the information 
isn’t the best idea, though.
“The consent is economic coer-
cion, in a sense,” Lidsky said.
It is tough to say no to an inter-
viewer, she said, especially in a tough economy.
“A lot of 
things we con-sent to we con-sent to because of social pressures,” she said.
No UF em-
ployers ask students for their Face-book login information, said Steve Orlando, UF spokesman.
Lidsky said problems with terms 
of service like this can negatively af-fect a company.
She said she suggests only post-
ing what you would want to explain to an interviewer, whether they ask or not.
“It would really change the na-
ture of Facebook if all users had to assume at all times any future em-ployer could use it,” Lidsky said.

Innovation Hub’s newest tenant, MindTree 
Limited, announced Tuesday it will bring 400 
jobs to Gainesville. About 70 percent of those jobs will be ﬁ  lled by city residents, and recruit-ers have their sights set on UF students and alumni.
MindTree Limited, an information technol-ogy company based in India, announced it will bring its U.S. development center to In-novation Hub at 720 SW Second Ave. to help Gainesville’s economy grow.
“We will do our part to make it the Silicon Valley of the Southeast,” said Scott Staples, co-founder of MindTree Limited.
City and university ofﬁ  cials said they are 
excited the company is coming to Gainesville.
“We have been wanting to start our econo-
my with a company like this,” said UF Presi-dent Bernie Machen.
He said UF will do everything it can to help 
MindTree transition easily to Gainesville.

City ofﬁ  cials may crack down 
on football gameday parking.
In a meeting Tuesday night, 
a committee decided to look into ways to bettter enforce rules re-garding gameday parking, such as requiring residents who park cars in their yards to purchase a different permit from the one al-ready required.
The Community Development 
Committee also discussed creat-ing more programs that encour-age students to drink less.
Throughout the years, resi-
dents in neighborhoods that bor-der campus have complained of heavy trafﬁ  c, increased litter and destruction of front lawns. Most of those problems are caused by drunken tailgaters, according to commissioners on the committee.
The new permit probably 
wouldn’t cost more than the cur-rent one to park in a yard, said As-sistant City Manager Fred Murry.
Commissioner Scherwin Henry said he didn’t know if the city should take on parking and drinking issues.
“We are trying to solve a neigh-
borhood problem that we as gov-ernment will not be able to totally solve,” he said. “We cannot legis-late human behavior.”
The committee will discuss the 
issue again before passing it to the City Commission.

Standing like a soldier re-
porting for duty , Alachua 
County Sheriff Sadie Darnell waited as the County Commis-sion decided her office would keep control of the county jail.
The commission unani-
mously approved an agreement Tuesday morning between the county and ASO to allow the Sheriff’s Office to keep control for the next six years, rather than turning the jail over to the county, but on one condition.
Under the contract, which 
was made by Darnell and coun-ty officials, the county must “use reasonable efforts” to re-serve money to hire 34 more jail employees.
If the county fails to fund 
the extra staff Darnell has con-sistently requested, she can ter -
minate the contract before Oct. 1, turning over control of the jail to county officials.
To fund the requested 34 
employees, the contract states the county should spend no more than $900,000 from the upcoming budget and $900,000 from next year’s budget
Darnell asked the com-
mission in August 2010 for 46 more employees because she felt the jail was understaffed. Many employees were work-ing overtime and weren’t get-ting enough time off to get ad-ditional training.
At the time, Darnell estimat-
ed the cost of the extra staff to be $2 million. The commission did not approve her request.
The commissioners de-
cided to pay a criminal justice consulting firm $179,000 to re-search how many employees the jail needed.
The study called for 18 extra 
employees to increase security and oversight and another 16 employees to run new and ex-isting jail programs.
Commissioner Lee Pinkoson 
said it will be difficult to fund that many positions, especially with looming budget cuts.
Darnell said she was pleased 
about the agreement.
“If they believe that only 18 
additional employees are need-ed at the jail, then they can have it,” she said. “But for now, this is a huge win.”

Allergy season has made itself 
known at UF, bringing pollen-cov-
ered cars, dry eyes and constant sneezing.
Allergen levels in Gainesville 
have been “very high” throughout March, according to The Weather Channel’s online pollen almanac.
The levels include low, medium, 
high and very high. The most active pollen type has been coming from trees, particularly oak and cedar.  
Records for last year’s pollen lev-
els were not available on The Weath-er Channel website.
Allergies are seasonal, said UF 
Student Health Care Center market-ing coordinator Catherine Seemann.
New plants release airborne par -
ticles like pollen that can react with people’s immune systems.
UF’s 2,000-acre campus contains 
thousands of trees, according to a Facilities Planning and Construction publication. It includes several for -
ested conservation areas, such as the Reitz Ravine Woods and Jennings Creek.  
History freshman Jami Lash, 19, 
takes allergy medication every day. 
“Anywhere I walked on campus, 
the pollen just stayed with me — on my clothes, in my hair,” she said.
Others, like 22-year-old art his-
tory senior Amanda Dearolph, are experiencing allergies but aren’t sure what is causing them.She said she suspects she is aller -
gic to pollen, which constantly coats her car.
Seemann recommended students 
see a doctor if they don’t know their allergies.
It is impossible to generalize 
treatment because it depends on people’s unique immune systems, she said.  
UF’s Allergy Clinic offers ongo-
ing therapy for allergy sufferers who can’t be treated by basic medication, said Health Care Center nurse Stacy Rider.
The Weather Channel predicts 
that the tree allergen season will end in early June.
Until then, students will have to 
brush off the pollen and keep going.Allergen levels ‘very high’ this month

County Sheriffdents connect with the compa-

Cammy Abernathy , dean of 
the College of Engineering, said a company like this offers in-ternships, possible career paths and inspiration to continue in the field.
“This will recruit more com-
puter science and computer engineering majors, and those are the majors in demand,” she said. 
She said Gainesville has a 
“brain drain” problem, which is the loss of talented college graduates when they move out of their home state or country.
“Engineering is in demand,” 
she said. “And this will help put a stop to the brain drain in Florida.”
Staples said the city’s inno-vative spirit and the number of qualified applicants make Gainesville an attractive place to set up shop.
He said Gainesville was the 
best fit for MindTree’s obses-sion with innovation and integ-rity.
“This has to be a success,” 
Staples said, 
“because our clients want it.”

� ABOUT A DOZEN PEOPLE PITCHED 
BUSINESS IDEAS TO POTENTIAL INVESTORS.
SHELBY WEBB
Alligator Writer
James Klausner stood in the lobby of the 
Hilton University of Florida Conference 
Center on Tuesday as potential investors meandered by.
He was among more than a dozen peo-
ple pitching businesses — in his case, Solar Fuel — to people who could help make his dream a reality.
“We need to move from just being a start-
up,” he said.
About 125 investors, UF and Santa Fe 
College faculty members, entrepreneurs and scientists gathered Tuesday to discuss innovation in Gainesville.
The conference was part of a citywide ef-
fort to promote the Florida Innovation Hub at UF. The sixth annual Innovation Show-case featured speakers and start-up compa-nies pitching to investors.
David Day, director of the Office of Tech-
nology Licensing, said the showcase al-lowed investors to meet the minds behind 14 Gainesville technology start-up compa-nies.
“Relationships will be formed that lay 
the groundwork for more in the future,” Day said.
Day and Jane Muir, the director of the In-
novation Hub, also announced the Innova-tion Gainesville Angel Network, iGAN.
Innovation Gainesville, run by the cham-
ber of commerce and the council for eco-nomic outreach, created iGAN, which In-novation Gainesville Vice President Ann Collett said would allow investors to browse company information online.
“We pair people with money with com-
panies that need it,” she said.
Klausner hoped his start-up would get 
some of that money.
A UF professor of mechanical and aero-
space engineering, Klausner said he helped design a process to convert solar energy into liquid fuel.
He said Solar Fuel got its start from grant 
money, but it will need investments for its next phase.
“Funding is our biggest challenge,” 
Klausner said. “Without funding, we can’t move the technology forward.”

The blood-sucking insects that 
herald summertime are already 
buzzing around Alachua County.
The Alachua County Health De-
partment is expecting an influx of mosquitoes in the county this spring because of the unusually warm win-ter, said Paul Myers, administrator of the Alachua County Health De-partment.
Because of the influx and a 
drought, the county has already started to tell residents how to avoid diseases spread by mosquitoes, such as West Nile virus and Eastern Equine virus.
The county does not have a his-
tory of disease outbreak caused by mosquitoes. The last time a case of West Nile virus was reported in the county was in the summer of 2004, according to reportable disease sta-tistics for Alachua County.
Myers said the county usually 
waits until May to send out preven-tion notices, but it sent out tips six weeks earlier this year.
“We are concerned,” Myers said. 
“Because of the mild winter, we didn’t see many hard freezes that substantially reduce the mosquito population, and now we are seeing even warmer weather and rain.”
Mosquitoes tend to breed in soil 
or standing water. Lots of standing water and little rain can mean more pests and diseases, said Jorge Rey , a UF professor of entomology and nematology at the Florida Medical Entomology Laboratory.
“The more water that is around, 
the more mosquitoes will breed,” Rey said.
But a lack of water doesn’t mean 
county residents can expect a de-crease in mosquito bites or the threat of disease.
Some species live in storm drains, 
Rey said. When there is no rain, there is no water to flush the insects and their eggs down the drain, allowing them to reappear when the weather gets warm.
Birds, which can carry West Nile 
virus, and mosquitoes are more likely to flock toward damp areas when water is scarce. This increases the chances of a mosquito feeding off a bird that may carry the virus, Rey said.
To prepare for mosquitoes, resi-
dents should dump standing water on their properties in places such as flower pots, trash cans and recycle bins, said David Dame, a retired en-tomologist for the USDA.
If they apply bug repellant, Dame 
said, residents should apply it by hand.
“We’ve got to get ready ,” Dame 
said. “Biting season is upon us.”

� ABOUT 80 PERCENT OF 2011 
MBA GRADUATES FROM UF HAD JOBS WITHIN THREE MONTHS. 
JULIA GLUM
Alligator Writer
More companies are hiring Master 
of Business Administration graduates 
now than they have the past two years, according to a story on the U.S. News & World Report website.
Of the full-time students at 135 busi-
ness schools that provided data to U.S. News, 78.8 percent had jobs within three months of graduating in 2011.
UF’s total placement percentage for 
the class of 2011 was about 80 percent, said Craig Petrus, director of Career Ser -
vices at UF’s Hough Graduate School of Business. This figure is about 14 percent more than the previous class’s place-ment, he said.
“We are definitely finding an increase 
in our MBA students from our corporate partners, both on a regional level here in the Southeast and nationally,” he said.
Petrus said the school’s career servic-
es team has been focusing on interacting with students to prepare them for get-ting into the job market. Advisers help students with resume writing, interview techniques and job search plans.
Recruiting also contributes to the 
school’s success.
“We have good relationships with 
the major companies within the state of Florida that tend to recruit at UF,” Petrus said.
Although the U.S. News story report-
ed that on-campus recruiters are increas-ingly hiring MBA graduates for technol-ogy positions, UF has not seen a drastic change. Recruiters are hiring graduates for all positions. The largest fields are sales and marketing, corporate finance and real estate, Petrus said.
Hough was recently ranked the 19th 
best public and 44th best overall busi-ness school by U.S. News. The school was the only Florida program ranked in the Top 50.

Annie ran across the playground and signed 
the word “helicopter” to tell her teacher about a 
helicopter flying overhead.
The 2-year-old was so excited that she 
couldn’t get the words out, said Diane Oak-man, assistant director for educational pro-gramming at Baby Gator Child Development and Research Center, a child care center for children of students, faculty and staff at UF.
UF students, faculty and staff who are par -
ents can learn to use beginner-level American Sign Language in two sessions next month at Baby Gator.
The deadline to register is today.Parents can choose to take the first session 
on April 2 or April 4 and the second session on April 9 or April 11. Classes are offered at 7:30 a.m. and 4 p.m. in the Academic Research Building, across from the McKnight Brain Insti-tute. The two one-hour sessions cost $25.
Parents will learn more than 100 signs ap-
propriate for signing with toddlers and chil-dren in kindergarten. They will also learn the fundamentals of American Sign Language and how it can enhance the children’s cognitive abilities and vocabulary.
“They’re at an age when they’re ready to 
communicate, but they can’t get the words out,” Oakman said. “And by using signs, the process gets a lot better.”
Oakman also said signing can reduce tan-
trums.
Keri Stacey, sign language facilitator and co-
ordinator for the program, said there’s a reason for that.
“The children can sign ‘more’, ‘milk’ or ‘eat’, 
and it shows them how powerful communica-tion is,” Stacey said.
In 2000, the National Institutes of Child 
Health and Human Development found young children who learn sign language speak sooner than other children.
According to the study, infants who learned 
sign language had a vocabulary of 50 words more than the non-signing infants.
“It’s great because there are a lot of differ -
ent learners,” Oakman said. “To those who are visual learners, it’s another cue to help them learn,”

Weird ads more    
shocking than effective  
This election season has definitely had its fair share of odd and unusual campaign advertisements.
As we noted earlier this semester, there was the overt-
ly racist ad from a senate race in Michigan, in which an Asian girl is wearing yellow, riding a bicycle through a rice paddy and saying, in a thick Chinese accent, that China will overtake the U.S. economy.
There was also an incredibly strange ad from former Repub-
lican presidential candidate Herman Cain, in which his creepy campaign manager is smoking and talking about how good his candidate is.
But a new ad from Herman Cain’s political organization 
takes the cake for odd and just plain weird.
The ad basically argues that our tax code kills small business-
es. Sounds like a standard Republican ad, right?
However, it is the way the ad illustrates this argument that is 
downright creepy.
The ad begins with a girl holding a large rabbit, saying that 
the bunny represents small business.
She then places the bunny in a nest of straw next to a piece 
of wood.
The girl then says, “This is small business under the current 
tax code.” Immediately after this, we find that the straw nest is actually a catapult, and the rabbit is launched into the air.
As the rabbit is flying through the air, we see a man hold-
ing a gun. The man shoots the rabbit, which explodes almost instantaneously.
Don’t worry, PETA — the rabbit that exploded was a com-
puter graphic.
It’s actually quite surprising that PETA hasn’t come out say-
ing that this ad encourages harm against animals.
The animal rights group is probably preparing to throw red 
paint on Cain as we speak.
While the ad clearly demonstrates its message by literally 
killing a representation of small business, did it really have to take it to such bizarre extremes?
Was this really the most effective way to illustrate this point?One would think that an organization with the funding of a 
figure like Cain could afford to find actual cases in which the tax code contributed to the closing of a small business.
Instead, Cain’s organization decided to make an incredibly 
disturbing, graphic Web ad that probably does nothing to con-vince anyone of its position.
Rather than encouraging debate about tax reform, the only 
thing people are saying about this video is how strange it is.
Let this be a lesson in political advertising.There are ways to draw people’s attention to an issue without 
going for the shock factor, as this ad clearly does.
It will be interesting to see what other strange ads come out 
as we get closer to Election Day in November.Foreign policy should be cautious, decisive
A clear agenda on foreign policy is something all our 
political parties lack. The Republican neoconser -
vatives, from former President George W. Bush to 
Newt Gingrich, have seen their hawkish ambitions dwin-dle as the American people have grown weary of constant foreign intervention. Libertarians, such as Ron Paul, preach pseudo-isolation, yet in a climate where nuclear weapons are prevalent, such an approach appears dangerous and nearsighted. President Barack Obama and the remainder of the political left are walking a tightrope between these two extremes — aware of the dangers across the seam, yet unwilling to face them head-on.
We are also unclear as to who our enemy is. Is it Islam 
as a whole? Is it a few belligerent states such as Iran and North Korea?
As Americans, we lack the united conviction that was 
trumpeted in the 20th century, when Germany and the So-viet Union were clear rivals to be fought at all costs. Our new enemies are transient and indefinable — rogue terror cells that hide in deep, dark places, unable to be identified until they have already struck.
Is the wisdom of our forefathers applicable in such an 
environment? Ron Paul seems to think so, and for that, he deserves credit. He has consistently preached caution and conservatism when dealing with rogue states, and he made the promise that he would never go to war without a formal declaration.
There is some precedent for this approach. American 
involvement with rogue nations (or even Arabic states) is not strictly a modern phenomenon.
In the formative years of our great nation, the Barbary 
pirates of Algeria demanded tribute in return for the safety of American sailors, with the alternative being capture and enslavement. After years of diplomacy and caution, our government, led by Thomas Jefferson, went to war. A navy was built and the pirates were crushed, with help from allies in the Old World. Thomas Jefferson could never be accused of being a hawkish neoconservative. He remains a representative of many libertarian principles. However, he knew that in certain times, America must act to preserve the safety of its people.
Unfortunately, we live in a 
world of much greater complex-ity than the one our founding fathers enjoyed. The Internet allows governmental delibera-tions to be shared with our en-emies in an instant. The threat of 
nuclear weapons hangs constantly overhead.
The cautious and conservative approach Ron Paul 
preaches has lost its element of pragmatism. Can we still make it a policy to formally declare war when such a de-bate, sent across the sea in nanoseconds, allows our ene-mies to take advantage of our inaction? Can we still ignore states such as Iran when they show the ability and desire to create a bomb to destroy and blackmail our allies?
It is easy to live in isolation when the greatest weapons 
of the day are cannons and wooden ships. It is much more difficult when nukes can destroy a city in a moment, and Chinese hackers can disable our economy from their liv-ing rooms.
Technology has brought great bounties, yet it has also 
brought great complications. We have been severed from the wisdom of our forefathers, forced to create new strate-gies to survive in this brave new world.
We have passed the age in which we can have a clear 
and concrete foreign policy; the world has grown too com -
plex for that. But we can imitate the strength of our fa-thers’ wills. Iraq has taught us the folly of nation-building and prolonged intrigue.
However, we should make it clear to our enemies, 
wherever they lurk, that if they raise their sabers, we will raise ours in return. Caution and prudence should remain our watchwords, yet when American lives are at risk, our guns must ring and our foes must fall.

With the arrival of the first black president in the Oval 
Office in 2008, it seemed that the U.S. had made a gi-ant leap in resolving race relations.    
That didn’t last long. After the election, President Barack 
Obama conceded that the pride his inauguration brought for having moved beyond the legacy of race “lasted about a day.”
Two recent incidents involving the killing of unarmed per -
sons have made abundantly clear that race relations need seri-ous examination both locally and nationally.
The first incident was the Feb. 26 shooting and killing of 
black 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in Sanford by a neighbor -
hood watch volunteer.
The second was the March 21 beating and killing of the Iraqi 
immigrant and 32-year-old mother of five, Shaima Alawadi, in El Cajon, Calif.
Both cases are tragedies of the highest degree and have 
stirred the emotions of Americans nationwide. There has been much speculation that Martin’s killing was racially motivated. Geraldo Rivera made headlines for saying that Martin’s hoodie was as responsible for his death as his the killer. 
The Orlando Sentinel reported that at a protest, the leader of 
the New Black Panther Party put a $10,000 bounty on the man who killed Trayvon.
The circumstances are similar in 
Alawadi’s killing. No suspects have been named yet, but one piece of ev-idence suggests we might be dealing with a hate crime: Next to Alawadi’s body was a note that read, “Go back to your country, you terrorist,” ac-cording to Alawadi’s daughter.
Perhaps Trayvon’s case was not 
a hate crime, but only a tragic killing of an innocent teenager by an otherwise mentally ill man. Perhaps something similar will be true for Alawadi’s killing.
Even so, it is clear that these two local killings have turned 
into national tragedies precisely because race relations are strained and unresolved in our country.
As Obama said about Trayvon’s death, “All of us have to 
do some soul-searching to figure out how does something like this happen.”
I appreciate Obama avoiding jumping to conclusions, but 
he seemed timid to bring the word “race” into the discussion.
Let’s be open about it: Racial profiling is a common oc-currence in the United States. Even if Trayvon wasn’t racially profiled, countless others like Trayvon are profiled for being young, black and wearing urban clothing.
These incidents are not isolated and ignorable, but extreme 
manifestations of underlying racism in our society.
Why is the portrait of a criminal a young black male in a 
hoodie? What in our culture and society causes someone to be-lieve that a mother wearing a hijab is a terrorist?
Examining these questions will help us understand the un-
derlying racism present in our country, so we can take steps toward resolving it.
To be clear, by no means should we jump to conclusions 
about the role of race in criminal cases. However, the harsh real-ity is that race often does play a role in criminal cases and their outcomes, and race relations in our country are still strained and deserving of our consideration. If we want to improve the legacy of race in the United States, we must not shy away from examining our race relations as an entire country, no matter how far we’ve progressed or how many hurdles we’ve over -
come.

opinions@alligator.orgStudents should urge Gov. Scott to veto 
tuition-hike bill
A topic that has been discussed pretty spar -
ingly since being passed by both the Florida 
House and Senate is Senate Bill 1752, which al-lows UF and Florida State University to raise tuition above the 15 percent maximum cur -
rently mandated by the state.
I’ve heard arguments by columnists in the 
Alligator equating higher tuition to students having better job opportunities and how edu-cation should be viewed as more of an invest-ment (forgetting that correlation doesn’t equal causation).
Well, I find fault with that stance. I find fault with the drive to privatize public schools in Florida and across the U.S. and the push to transform institutions of learning into full-fledged corporations more obsessed with mar -
keting than the quality of their institutions.
Will a higher cost for a UF diploma result 
in better professors and a better learning en-vironment? Overall, do these increases really maintain UF’s integrity as a public university?
Since the introduction of the mandated 
15-percent hikes, UF’s rankings have steadily declined and have fallen to a national ranking of 58, according to U.S. News & World Report. Why the hike if no tangible benefit has yet to manifest?The 45-percent hike proposed by UF Presi-
dent  Bernie Machen is a direct attack on work-ing-class families and students, disadvantaged minorities and the accessibility to a quality education at UF for students all over Florida.
Loans are not the solution. Students 
shouldn’t have to take extra jobs after coming to UF under the impression they are attending a quality university at a reasonable price.
It’s hypocritical for the university to admit 
a record number of students these past two years and talk about budget shortfalls and the need for more flexibility.
Education may be viewed by many in this 
nation as a privilege, but I and many others view the access to an affordable education to all as the principle norm of a free society . The administration’s stance on this issue shows its callous, elitist and overall inhuman lack of feel-ing toward students and potential students.
Students: We must come together and pres-
sure Gov. Rick Scott to veto this bill. Thursday, Students for a Democratic Society will be hold-ing a rally to show the state and UF adminis-tration that these moves to decrease accessibil-ity and privatize public education in Florida won’t be taken sitting down.

The Student Senate unani-
mously passed a bill supporting 
the Student Green Energy Fund at Tuesday night’s meeting.
The bill, which will be voted on 
for a final time next week, supports a fund for projects that would low-er energy use on campus.
It also supports an “energy 
fee,” which would cost students 50 cents per credit hour up to a maxi-mum of $15 per semester.
The Senate has no jurisdiction 
over fees. Before the meeting, Gators Going Green Agency Head Brittnie Baker said she hoped Sen-ate support would show adminis-trators that students were willing to support such a fee.
Baker, a former senator, pre-
sented the bill and said that in the 2007-08 academic year, a Student Government referendum for the fee passed with 78 percent ap-proval from student voters.
She said the university pays $43 
million a year in energy costs.
The fee will cost the average 
student about $6 per semester, she said, similar to the cost of a Chipo-tle burrito.
Alex Palomino, who presented 
with Baker, said the fund will save the university about $600,000 a year.
“Think of this as saving money for the university so tuition hikes don’t have to keep happening,” said Palomino, the director of stu-dent outreach for Gators Going Green.
The spring Student Govern-ment election ballots didn’t in-clude a referendum on this because of time constraints, Baker said.
Baker and Palomino suggested 
periodically adding the referen-dum to SG voting ballots so stu-dents can vote to alter or eliminate the fee.
The Senate also passed a bill to 
allocate $49,293 to renovate Room 300 of the Reitz Union. The reno-vations will occur after this semes-ter.
Sen. Umair Asghar was the 
only senator to speak against the bill. He said his problem was with the price tag.
The other bill that passed Tues-
day night was originally support-ing the Kony 2012 campaign, but senators debated the bill and made a few changes.
Sen. Nathan Wangusi, who co-
authored the bill, spoke passion-ately in favor of the bill.
“In my mind, one child suf-
fering is one child too many,” he said.
However, Sen. Carly Wilson 
proposed amendments to change the bill from supporting the Kony 2012 campaign to supporting, ap-prehending and prosecuting Jo-seph Kony.
The last bill the Senate heard 
Tuesday expressed condolences for Trayvon Martin.
Senators debated whether they 
should remove the “white and La-tino” description of George Zim-merman, who claimed he shot Trayvon in self-defense. They postponed the bill to next week.
Sen. Amanda Norman, who co-
authored the bill, expressed dis-pleasure with the vote.
“We will be going through the 
same thing next week for no rea-son,” she said.

UF students will have a chance to talk 
to their Student Senators in an informal 
setting today.
Students can attend The Great Divide, a 
town hall forum, at Pugh Hall from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m.
A town hall forum is an informal meet-ing with leaders and their constituents. At this meeting, students can ask senators questions and discuss diversity and ste-reotypes that affect them.
“I want to bring forth a means of com-
munication,” said Senate President Aun-dre Price.
Price said this will be his first initiative 
as Senate president.
The Senate co-sponsored the event with the Black Student Union’s Leadership De-velopment Institute, or LDI, SAVANT and the Pride Student Union.
LDI has hosted The Great Divide on campus for at least two years, said LDI co-director Shanice Richardson. She said this is the first year the group has teamed up with Student Government.
“We want to make it bigger than ever,” 
Richardson said.
She said she wants students to leave 
the meeting understanding they are all Gators.
“We want to break common stereo-
types,” she said.

FOR RENT
2, STUDENT LIVING GUIDE, ALLIGATOR  WEDNESDAY, MARCH 28, 2012
Gainesville has an abundance of off-campus 
housing options including apartments, condos, 
houses and rooms for rent, so take your time.  Be sure to visit several properties in person and shop around before signing a lease. Follow the tips be-low for ﬁ  nding the right place for you:
 Use the Off Campus Housing Locator ser-
vice at http://housing.offcampus.uﬂ  .edu.
 Know your budget and choose a property 
that allows you to live within your means.
 Create a priority list.  What do you care about 
most in a living space?  Room size, rent, type of lease, type of community (large undergrad popu-lation, graduate students, local residents, etc.), location, proximity to campus or bus route…all these things are factors to consider in choosing a place to live.  Write out a list of ideal characteris-tics you want in your future living space and keep these criteria in mind when selecting a location.
 Choose a well-suited roommate or choose 
to live alone.  Know what kind of person would best compliment your personality and choose ac-cordingly.
 Drive around and visit the place and neigh-
borhood you are looking to live in.  
 Take a tour of the complexes or houses that interest you, ask questions and get to know the complex management or rental house landlord.
 Ask your friends for advice on where to live.  
Which properties worked well for them?  Which didn’t?
 Visit the Gainesville Police Department web-
site www.gainesvillepd.org and click on the Crime Reports link to view crime statistics before signing a lease.  Enter the address you’re interested in and all reported crime incidents, within the last three months, will appear on an interactive map.  
 Go back to the property at night and make 
some observations, like:  Is it well lit? Do you see the security guard that management promised? Is the security gate working? Is it quiet enough to study?  How close is the bus stop or parking to the complex or house, etc.?
 Once you’ve narrowed down your search, 
make an appointment with UF’s Student Legal Services by going to their website www.studentle-galservices.uﬂ  .edu and completing the Client In-take Form.  SLS can help you in reviewing the lease BEFORE you sign it.  This is a great way to know what your legal responsibilities will be under that lease. 
 Gainesville is a GREAT place to rent and live 
so have fun with your search.
WHAT IS OFF CAMPUS LIFE?

for information about Off Campus Life resources and services. Also, don’t forget to like OCL on Facebook at UF’s Off Campus Life and fol-low us on Twitter @UFoffcampuslife for daily updates and reminders of OCL events, tips and fun things going on in the community.Make sure you read and fully understand all 
aspects of the lease before signing.  A lease is a 
contract between you and your landlord that spells out speciﬁ  c details of your living arrangement.  Leases often involve policies about pets, security and pet deposits, legal entry and other important information.  Typically, leases in Gainesville are 12 months. If you will need a place for 10 months or less, talk with the management about whether they can provide a short-term lease.  There are two types of leases that are usually available, joint leases and individual leases.
Joint Lease: All roommates are held responsi-
ble for the lease.  If one person breaks the lease, the other roommates are held responsible for paying the total rent.  This tends to be the lease more prominent when renting a house or single family dwelling.
Individual Lease: Each person is held respon-
sible for his or her own actions.  For instance, if one roommate breaks the lease, that person is still responsible for paying their own rent.  For most college students, individual leases are the best choice.  Each person in the lease is responsi-ble for his or her own actions and not the actions of a roommate.

Having a roommate is a great way to di-
vide the cost of living off campus, but if you 
don’t find the right person to live with, living off campus could be challenging.  Below are some tips that will help you if you are think-ing about living with a roommate.
 Communication is key.  Talk about your 
budget for housing, expectations for safety and guests and what your housing needs are before you even begin your search.  Being on the same page as your roommates will make your co-habitation experience much better and reduce the possibility of conflict. 
 Start with a friend or sibling.  These are 
often good options for roommates since you already know them.
 Before moving in, come to an agree-
ment about who will get which bedroom and bathroom along with which cabinets/storage space each person can use.
 Discuss how payment of rent and bills 
will take place.  Is each person respon-sible for their own bills or will someone be in charge of collecting payment from each roommate?
 Make sure you can change apartments 
if management places you with roommates you are not compatible with. Don’t have someone you want to live with?  
Some apartment complexes offer “Roommate Matching” or “Roommate Placement.”
 Roommate Matching: You fill out a 
survey and management attempts to match you with compatible roommates based on the form Roommate Placement: Apartment 
management places you in any open space they have available
 OCL also has a NEW roommate search 
feature available through the housing loca-tor http://housing.offcampus.ufl.edu/. 
 Being friends with someone and liv-
ing with a friend can be two totally different things.  See the Gator Guide to Off Cam-pus Life for some tips on how to stay friends while living together at www.offcampus.ufl.

Both personal and property safety is im-
portant as you search for off-campus hous-
ing.  Before signing a lease, Off Campus Life recommends you check the crime statis-tics of an area.  A free service called Crime Reports is available on the Gainesville Police Department’s website.  Crime Reports allows you to see all reported crime in a certain area.  Go to www.gainesvillepd.org, click “Crime Reports” on the right-hand side, and enter the address of interest to see local in-cident data.
Below are five tips to use when looking 
at safety during your apartment search:
1. Go back to the complex at night.  
How do you feel?  How does the environ-ment seem?  Is the place well-lit and popu-lated, or dark and isolated?
2. Does the property have working se-
curity gates and/or guards?
3. Check for deadbolts on the outside 
door, peepholes on exterior doors, locks for individual doors, alarm systems, etc. Ask lots of questions about the security. Is there an extra charge for a security system? 
4. Has there been crime in the area re-
cently?  What actions have been done to 
prevent crime from happening?
5. Don’t forget about purchasing some 
Renter’s Insurance to protect you and your stuff from the unexpected.
Information reprinted with permission from UF’s Off Campus LifeSAFETY TIPS RENTER’S INSURANCE
If you are thinking about renting a house or apartment, Renter’s 
Insurance provides important coverage for both you and your pos-
sessions. A standard Renter’s Policy protects your personal prop-erty in case of theft or damage and may pay for temporary living expenses if your rental is damaged. It can also shield you from personal liability. Anyone who leases a house or apartment should consider this type of coverage. 
Talk with your family before getting your own renter’s policy.  
If you are still financially dependent on your parents or a family member and they own a home, they might be able to cover you under their homeowner’s policy.  Some homeowner policies will cover a dependent’s rental property while in college.  
There are several types of residential insurance policies.  Read 
your policy information carefully and ensure you have full cover-age.  Policies should include the following items: 
Floods, earthquakes and hurricanes aren’t on the list. If you live 
in an area prone to one or more of the three, you’ll need to buy a separate policy or a rider. In areas where hurricanes can pose a threat, you might also need to buy a separate rider to cover wind damage.  Ask your insurance agent about this extra coverage.  Gainesville is prone to hurricanes and some areas flood. Vandalism or malicious mischief  Damage by glass or safety-glazing 
    material that is part of a building 
 Falling objects  Water-related damage 
    from home utilities 
 Electrical surge damage Fire or lightning  Windstorm or hail  Explosion  Aircraft  Vehicles  Smoke Theft

You can’t find the right place to live until you know 
how much you are able to spend.  Here are some 
budget questions you should think about while tour-ing a property:
1. What is the monthly rent?
2. What’s included in that rent?  Utilities, gas, 
water, cable, internet?
3. What’s not included in rent?  What is the av-
erage monthly cost for gas, electric, water, garbage 
disposal?  If management doesn’t know, contact GRU at www.gru.com and they can give you average costs of utilities for the previous year.
4. What fees are charged, (including appli-
cation fees, redecoration fees, processing fees, 
and deposits)? Consider these costs and how they 
impact your budget.
5. Want to have a pet?   Factor in the deposit 
and monthly cost for food, medical and grooming 
care.
6. Don’t forget the insurance.   Before you sign 
your lease, call your insurance company and see how much it will cost monthly to insure your apart-ment or house.
7. Are you going to need fuel for your ve-
hicle or are you going to use the bus?  Factor in 
transportation/car maintenance costs to your budget. UF students pay for the bus system as part of tuition therefore if you show a Gator1 ID you can board the bus without a charge.
8. How much will you spend monthly on 
groceries or on a meal plan?9. Have some fun!  Don’t spend so much on rent 
that you don’t have money for leisure time.
10. What do you spend on clothing, shoes 
and accessories? 
11. How much money can you save every 
month?   It’s really good to save some money ev-
ery month to cover unexpected emergency expens-es.  Even $20 a month saved is good, every little bit counts.
Your living environment plays a major factor in 
your overall happiness level.  Know what you want to get out of your living space and choose your location and roommate(s) accordingly.  Gainesville should be your home away from home so let Off Campus Life help you get the most out of your off-campus experi-ence.BUDGETS

SEE PAGES 2 AND 4 FOR LEASING INFORMATION 
PROVIDED BY OFF CAMPUS LIFEWHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT LEASING
GETTING EVICTED
Information reprinted with permission from UF’s Student Legal ServicesWHAT SHOULD I LOOK FOR IN AN APARTMENT?
Application Deposits: Never put down a deposit to hold an apartment unless 
you have a written agreement indicating whether it is refundable.
Model Apartments: Never sign a lease based upon a model. Insist on seeing 
your actual apartment.
Cost: Can you afford it? Even if your roommates leave?
Safety: Inspect the locks on the doors and windows – is there a deadbolt on the 
front door? 
Do sliding glass doors have adequate locks to deter forced entry? 
Are the hallways and parking lots well lit? Make sure tree limbs and shrubs in front of the apartment are well trimmed. You can contact the Alachua County Sheriff’s Office or the Gainesville Police De-
partment for information on crime in the area.
Function: At move-in, check all plumbing and appliances. Run water in sinks, 
showers and tubs, flush toilets, and check air conditioning and heating. 
Inventory: Note all defects on the inventory sheet or check-in list signed by the 
landlord or an impartial witness. 
Photograph or videotape the apartment at movie-in.
Appearance: Is it clean? Do the carpets look worn or smell bad? 
Has the apartment been painted recently? Do the walls have nail holes? 
Roommates: In some Gainesville neighborhoods, only three unrelated persons 
may live together. 
Check with the city if you plan on having more than two roommates.Records: Retain a copy of the lease and all attachments or addendums to the 
lease for your records. 
Have all promised repairs and improvements written into the lease and signed 
by the landlord.
Pets: Get clear written permission for any pets.
Can I Be Evicted For Any Other Reason?
Yes! Your lease can be terminated if you violate 
any lease terms, rules and regulations, or the Act. 
If your lease is terminated and you do not vacate 
the apartment, the landlord may file for your evic-
tion immediately.
Termination begins with a 7-day notice.  Your options depend on whether the violations 
are classified as “curable” or “noncurable”.
If you receive either type of notice, you should 
contact an attorney. Neither termination of your lease, nor your eviction from the apartment ends your liability for rent!
Curable Violations
You will be given seven days to correct a curable 
violation. 
Curable violations include unauthorized pets, 
guests, parking, or the failure to keep the apartment clean and sanitary. 
If you repeat the violation within 12 months, you 
will not be given another chance. 
Noncurable Violations
The landlord may terminate your lease with a 
7-day notice without giving you a chance to correct a noncurable violation. 
Noncurable violations include deliberate destruc-
tion or misuse of the landlord’s property or a contin-ued, unreasonable disturbance.WHAT SHOULD I DO BEFORE I SIGN A LEASE?
DO
 Read the lease and make 
sure you understand it.
 Review a copy of the 
lease with an attorney prior to signing it.
 Expect to pay full rent, 
not just your share. This is what “joint and several” lia-bility means, a term included or implied in nearly all leas-es. 
 Obtain a copy of the 
lease and all attachments or addendums to the lease, and put everything with your per-sonal records.
 Have all promised re-
pairs and improvements writ-ten into the lease and signed by the landlord.
 Insist on seeing your ac-
tual unit.
 Get clear written permis-
sion for any pets.
 Check for maintenance 
responsibilities when renting a house or duplex.DON’T
 Do not sign a 12-month lease 
unless you are willing to pay rent for 12 months.
 Do not sign a 12-month lease 
with roommates unless all room-mates are willing to ay rent for 12 months.
 Do not have your parents signed 
the lease or a parental guarantee agreeing to be responsible for rent, if possible. See if the landlord will accept an additional security deposit instead.
 Do not sign a lease with auto-
matic renewal clause.
 Do not sign a lease that gives 
the landlord unlimited access to the apartment without notice or consent.
 Do not sign a lease based upon 
a model apartment.
 Do not sign a lease before vis-
iting the neighborhood at various times during the day, at night and on weekends.
 Do not sign a lease until all 
agreements negotiated with the landlord are in writing.
What Are My Duties As A Tenant?
 First, last and always, PAY RENT!
 Comply with all other lease terms.
 Comply with all rules and regulations. Comply with housing and health codes. Comply with all zoning restrictions.
 Keep the apartment clean and sanitary.
 Keep plumbing fixtures sanitary.
 Do not damage the apartment.
 Do not disturb your neighbors.
What Exactly Is An Eviction?
An eviction is the formal end to your right to oc-
cupy the apartment. It does not end your duty to pay rent. 
An eviction starts with a Summons. You must file 
an Answer within 5 days. Contact an attorney im-mediately.
If the court rules against you, a judgment for posses-
sion of the apartment, unpaid rent, late fees, interest, court costs and attorney’s fees will be entered for the landlord. The sheriff will post a notice at the apartment that requires you to vacate within 24 hours. If you do not vacate within 24 hours, the sheriff will remove you and your personal property from the apartment.
Can I Be Evicted If I Pay “My” Rent and My 
Roommates Don’t?
Usually. Most leases provide that the tenants are 
jointly and severally liable for the entire rent. This 
means the landlord can evict you unless the full rent is paid.It is possible for you to sue your roommates in 
small claims court to collect their share of the rent and utilities. A written roommate agreement will be helpful in proving your case in court. 
 Given the difficulty of collecting money on a judg-
ment quickly, the best thing you can do is obtain new roommates.
So What If I Get Sued? I Have No Money!
Any judgment for money damages is enforceable 
for at least 20 years and earns interest. A judgment may be enforced by seizing your wages, bank ac-counts, or your personal property.  A judgment will also adversely affect your credit rating.
What Can Happen If I Don’t Pay Rent?
Failure to pay rent is the quickest way to be 
evicted! The landlord will serve a notice demanding payment of rent or possession of the apartment. 
If you fail to comply with the demand within three 
days, excluding week-ends and holidays, eviction proceedings may be started. Nei-ther surrender of the apartment or eviction ends your liability for rent! 
You should contact 
an attorney immedi-ately upon receipt of a three-day notice.VIOLATIONS

GETTING ALONG
GETTING IT BACKDo I Really Need Insurance For MY Personal 
Property?
Yes. Unless you are financially able to replace all 
your belongings, you should have insurance. Proper 
insurance coverage will protect you against the loss of your valuables in most circumstances. 
Landlords are legally responsibly for such losses 
only under very specific, limited circumstances that may be very difficult to prove in court. 
If you are a resident-relative of your parents, your 
personal property may be insured through their hom-eowner’s policy. Have your parents confirm the cover-age in writing with their insurance agent. 
If coverage is not available through your parents’ 
homeowner’s policy, you may be able to purchase renter’s insurance. 
Even with insurance, there are certain precautions 
you should always take. Always lock your apartment securely even if you are only going next door. 
Never leave jewelry, cameras, cash, checkbooks, 
credit cards, electronics, or other valuables in plain view.My Landlord Refuses to Make Repairs, What 
Can I Do?
You MAY be able either to withhold your rent or 
terminate your lease if the problem constitutes a ma-terial breach of the lease or the Act. You must follow the exact requirements of the Act. 
 You must give the landlord a written notice de-
manding the repairs be made in seven days. The no-tice must indicate to terminate the lease or withhold rent if the repairs are not made.  
This is a complicated process and the legal con-
sequences are very serious. Do not attempt to termi-nate your lease or withhold rent without first obtain-ing legal advice.
Can I Deduct Repair Costs From My Rent?
No. The Act does not authorize you to make re-
pairs or to recover the cost of such repairs. In fact, most apartment leases prohibit repairs by tenants. When the landlord refuses to make repairs, the Act gives you a qualified right to terminate the lease or withhold rent. As previously indicated, you should consult an attorney before attempting to terminate the lease or withhold rent.What Can I Do About Noisy Neighbors?
Try to reason with the neighbor to reach an accept-
able compromise. Thin walls and conflicting schedules make some amount of noise disturbance an unavoid-able reality of apartment living.
Ask the landlord for assistance. If the landlord refuses 
to correct the problem, you may be able to break your 
lease. Because the law in this area is so poorly devel-oped, legal representation is a necessity. 
In extreme cases, call the police and report the matter. 
Unfortunately, this can lead to revenge and reprisals. 
I Can’t Stand My Roommate. What Can I Do?
Discuss the matter with your roommate immedi-
ately. Don’t ignore the problem with the hope that 
it will go away. A little give and take may result in a livable compromise. 
Under the Act, your landlord is not responsible for 
most roommate disputes. If your roommate is violat-ing the lease, you should consult an attorney.  
Can My Rent Be Increased During My Lease Term?
Not unless the lease contains a specific provision al-
lowing for a rent increase. From the tenant’s perspective, 
one of the primary reasons for having a written lease is to lock in the rent for the rental period. Normally, you should not sign a lease providing for a rent increase.
Can My Landlord Enter My Apartment With-out Notice?
No. Unless there is an emergency or you have 
abandoned your apartment, the landlord must pro-vide reasonable notice and obtain your consent prior to entering your apartment. 
You cannot unreasonably withhold consent. If the 
landlord persists in entering without notice or con-sent, contact an attorney.
How Soon Must I Renew My Lease?
There is no time period established by the Act. You 
should not sign a lease that provides for automatic re-
newals of requires you to give the landlord a notice of nonrenewal. If you do sign such a lease, you must strictly comply with the notice requirements imposed by the lease.   
If the lease does not specify otherwise, renewals are 
a matter of general contract law. The landlord cannot force you to renew prior to the end of your lease.  How-ever, if you do not renew by the landlord’s “deadline,” the landlord may rent your apartment to someone else.INSURANCE
Information reprinted with permission from UF’s Student Legal ServicesWhat Can I Do If My Landlord Doesn’t 
Return My Deposit?
A landlord shall have 15 days after termination of 
the lease to return the security deposit together with in-
terest if otherwise required, if he or she does not intend to impose a claim on the security deposit. 
If the landlord intends to impose a claim in the se-
curity deposit, he or she shall have 30 days to give the tenant written notice by certified mail, stating how much is going to deducted and why. 
You must object to the deduction in writing within 15 
days from the date you receive the notice, or the land-lord will be authorized to deduct his or her claim from your security deposit.

Can I Break My Lease Because…
I am graduating?   No!
My roommate left?    No!
I cannot afford the rent?  No!
I need to work this summer?  No!
The neighborhood is unsafe?  No!
Under the Act, you can only terminate the 
lease if the landlord is materially violating your 
lease or the Act. 
You should obtain legal advice before at-
tempting to terminate your lease. In many cas-es, the best thing you can do is find replace-ment tenants.
Can I Sublet My Apartment?
Usually. The landlord cannot unreasonably 
withhold consent to an assignment or sub-lease. 
The landlord may require potential replace-
ment tenants to submit an application includ-ing a credit check. 
The landlord may also charge a reasonable 
sublet fee even when you provide the replace-ment tenants.
Normally you remain liable under your 
lease if the replacement tenants do not pay rent or damage the apartment. Some land-lords will release you from the obligations of your lease. 
If you are being released, get it in writing.
Can I Just Move Out and Forfeit My 
Security Deposit?
No. 
Some tenants will walk out on a lease and 
receive no adverse action, while others will be pursued to the fullest extent of the law.  
In Gainesville’s current rental market, the 
odds are that you will be sued unless you sup-ply acceptable replacement tenants. 
Your losses in court will not be limited to 
your security deposit, but will include rent for each month the apartment remains vacant during the term of your lease, plus court costs and the landlord’s attorney’s fees.Can I use My Security Deposit for the Last Month’s 
Rent?
No. Landlords can legally evict you for non-payment of rent 
even when your “security deposit” is equal to your last month’s 
rent. The purpose of the security deposit is to protect the land-lord against damages to the apartment.
Does the Law Require Interest Payments 
on Security Deposits?
Landlords must hold security deposits in one of three meth-
ods. Two methods of holding the deposits require interest to be 
paid. The method which does not require interest payment is the one most landlords use. The landlord is required to inform you in writing how your deposit is being held, where it is held, and whether you will receive interest.
If the landlord fails to give the required notice within the 30-
day period, he or she forfeits the right to impose a claim upon the security deposit.
However, if you damaged the apartment, the landlord can 
sue you even when the 30-day notice is not given. Because the landlord can also get court costs and attorney’s fees, you should consult an attorney before filing any lawsuits.
What Steps Can I Take To Protect My Security 
Deposit?
When you take occupancy of the apartment, complete a thor-
ough written inventory of the apartment’s condition and have 
the landlord or an impartial witness sign the inventory. Make sure you keep a copy of the inventory. This helps protect you from the landlord claiming you caused pre-existing damage.
When you move out, clean the apartment completely and 
thoroughly. Some landlords provide a checklist outlining the cleaning they expect you to do. Keep all your receipts for clean-ing supplies and professional carpet cleaning as evidence.
Before you leave, ask the landlord to inspect the apartment 
with you. Complete a move-out checklist and make sure the landlord signs and dates it. Use an impartial witness if the land-lord is not available or refuses your request. Move-in and move-out photographs or videotape are strongly recommended in case there is a dispute.GETTING IT BACKGETTING OUT

Alligator Writer
 
JACKSONVILLE — An un-
proven newcomer got the best of 
a heralded All-American Tuesday night. 
Casey Turgeon, Florida’s 
freshman second baseman, and James Ramsey, Florida State’s se-nior center fielder, unexpectedly crossed paths in the game’s big-gest play in front of 10,751 fans at the Baseball Grounds of Jackson-ville.
With his team down 1-0 in the 
sixth inning, Turgeon ripped a 1-0 pitch to deep center field, sending Ramsey on a frantic sprint that ended with his body, garnet cap and the ball all hitting the turf. 
Mike Zunino and Taylor Gush-
ue crossed home plate toward a UF dugout that was as euphoric as it has been all season. 
“I thought he caught it to be 
honest,” Turgeon said. “I saw it hit the ground and I was like, ‘Wow.’ I was really surprised.” 
On a night when runs were as 
tough to come by as a seat, the quick outburst was all No. 1 Flor -
ida (23-2, 5-1 Southeastern Con-ference) would need. After two additional runs tacked on by left fielder Vickash Ramjit, the No. 4 Seminoles (21-4, 8-1 Atlantic Coast Conference) fell by a score of 4-1. 
The victory snapped a four-
game losing streak in the series for the Gators when playing in Jacksonville and gave Florida its first season series victory over Florida State since 2009. 
“We came out here and we had 
to do anything possible to win,” junior reliever Steven “Paco” Ro-driguez said. “We haven’t won here in a few years, so it was a big-time game for us.”
Before the Gators were able to 
break through, the game was a defensive grind. Apart from a run on a Ramsey fielder’s choice to first that was misplayed by Gush-ue, it was scoreless for 5.5 innings. A damp wind was blowing in, the temperature was dropping and the park was playing as pitcher-friendly as the Polo Grounds.
UF starter Greg Larson had a 
strong 3.2-inning outing, but it was FSU right-hander Scott Sitz who made things rough early for Florida. The Gators entered the sixth inning with just one hit af-ter stranding two runners in each of the two previous innings and their only highlights had come on defense.
Sophomore left-hander Daniel 
Gibson entered in the fourth and got out of a second-and-third, two-out jam with one pitch. Two innings later, freshman right-hander Johnny Magliozzi was called upon with the bases loaded and one out. He needed only six pitches to register a 5-4-3 double play that ignited the Gators. 
“That’s about as difficult of a 
situation as you can be in, so the way [Magliozzi] responded and the way he pitched, I couldn’t be more proud of him,” UF coach Kevin O’Sullivan said.
From there it was all Turgeon, 
Ramjit and Florida’s two most 
prominent re-lievers.
R o d r i g u e z 
and Austin Maddox were once again an u n s t o p p a b l e duo, working the game’s final three innings, 
allowing just one hit and striking out a combined four batters. 
When Seminoles right fielder 
Seth Miller whiffed at Maddox’s final pitch of the night, there was  extra enthusiasm on the field just like there had been in the fourth and the sixth. This game meant a little more, and the abrasive screams of the cream uniform-clad Gators provided all the proof spectators needed. 
“We finally got one,” 
O’Sullivan said. “It’s the first time in five years. I’m really pleased with the way we played.”

SPRING FOOTBALL
GREG LUCA
Alligator Staff Writer
 
As Florida’s offense sputtered to a No. 105 
national ranking in yards per game last season, 
the line often took the majority of the blame. 
The unit rarely generated a strong push in 
the ground game, as the Gators’ rushing attack finished 73rd in the NCAA. Opponents had an easy time penetrating for big stops, as Florida allowed an average of 7.39 tackles for loss per game, the ninth-most in the nation. 
But a new spring season has brought a 
fresh dose of optimism. 
Florida’s line returns four starters to a unit 
that believes it enters 2012 with more tough-ness, togetherness and experience. 
“They’re way more physical,” defensive 
tackle Omar Hunter said about the line’s per -
formance in Saturday’s scrimmage. “Down in the red zone, they were running the ball really hard. Guys were pulling together.”
Left tackle Xavier Nixon, center Jonotthan 
Harrison, right guard Jon Halapio and right tackle Matt Patchan are all reprising roles they assumed in 2012. 
The only new face among the current first 
team is sixth-year senior James Wilson, who started at left guard in UF’s lone scrimmage so far. 
With so many familiar faces, the offensive 
line has developed stronger chemistry.
“A lot more unity , a lot more togetherness,” Harrison said. “You get used to the people you’re working with.”
 Coach Will Muschamp said the offensive 
line was one of two position groups — along 
with the secondary — where chemistry is most important. 
After a year together, 
Hunter said he can see an improvement in that area from this year’s unit. 
“They were a little bit 
younger last year but I feel like they’re more together 
this year,” Hunter said. “When times get hard they pull together and say , ‘Lets go, lets go. Finish plays.’ … One of them false started, and instead of all of the guys jumping on him and getting mad — what they did last year — they said ‘OK’ and just picked it up and made the next play. That’s the biggest difference I’ve seen.”
On top of the mental adjustments, a num-
ber of the first-team offensive linemen have changed their body types. 
Nixon has bulked up from 292 to 309, al-
leviating one of his biggest weaknesses from past seasons. Harrison has also added weight, from 295 to 309. 
“We do maybe look a little bit bigger just 
because we’ve been in the weight room and this offseason program really has been helping

AT HOME AT 6:30 P.M. GILROY LEADS THE TEAM IN DRAW CONTROLS WITH 44.
JOSH JURNOVOY
Alligator Writer
 
Shannon Gilroy’s career as a 
Gator was in jeopardy before it 
ever started.
A member of the 2011 U.S. 
Women’s U-19 Team and three-time U.S. Lacrosse All-American at Northport High in New York, Gilroy tore her left ACL in the last minute of a double-overtime state championship game last June.
“I was definitely really wor -
ried,” Gilroy said. “I didn’t know what was going to happen. I just knew I had to work really hard in order to play my freshman year.”
The highest-rated recruit of 
UF’s 2011 class worked her way back, becoming a significant con-tributor who is hoping to contin-ue her strong play tonight at 6:30 as No. 4 Florida (10-2, 1-0 Ameri-can Lacrosse Conference) hosts Fresno State (2-3).
After missing the entire fall 
season, Gilroy was able to get back on the field when spring practice began. Coach Amanda O’Leary said that despite the severity of the injury, she knew Gilroy would be able to make an impact this season.
“She has put the time and ef-
fort in,” O’Leary said. “Other people coming off ACL injuries, if they don’t put time in they are not going to reap the benefits.”
The improvement was not evi-
dent from the outset of the spring. Gilroy said she had trouble at first seeing desired results until realizing she was putting herself under too much pressure.
“I was too hard on myself,” 
Gilroy said. “I didn’t realize that until my teammates and coach-es pointed that out to me, and I started to loosen up a bit.”
After not scoring in the Gators’ 
first two games, Gilroy has been impressive in the 10 games since, scoring 17 goals and notching five assists. 
“Offensively, I think Shannon 
is starting to find her rhythm,” O’Leary said. “She’s a great tar -
get to try and find. She’s strong so she can go through double teams, and she has a great stick. We’re really pleased she is on our team and we don’t have to de-fend her.”
Gilroy’s 44 draw controls are 
also 16 more than anyone else on the team.
“It starts with the draw,” 
O’Leary said. “She has great height so she can draw it to her -
self, and when she’s not drawing to herself she can pull it to our attackers, who seem to be able to come up with it.”
Junior transfer attacker Gabi 
Wiegand, a native of Bay Shore, N.Y., played against Gilroy in high school and with her at the club level. Wiegand said Gilroy’s effectiveness on the draw gives the attackers the ability to get down the field faster.“Sometimes I don’t even run 
in to get the ball [on draws],” Wiegand said. “I’m looking to go down field because I have so much confidence she’ll get the ball on her stick and it will be in our offensive end.”
While O’Leary is pleased 
with what Gilroy has brought to the team so far this season, she knows that the freshman will ac-complish much bigger things in the future.
“She’s a young lady where if 
you set a goal in front of her she is going to achieve it.” Healthy Gilroy, Gators 
ready for Fresno State
“I was definitely really 
worried (after tearing the 
ACL in her left knee). I 
didn’t know what was going 
to happen. I just knew I had 
to work really hard in order 
to play my freshman year.”

While Halapio’s weight 
has remained about the same, 
Patchan dropped from 292 to 279, while Wilson went from 334 to 327. 
The change has Wilson, who 
is finally healthy after an injury-plagued first five years at UF, playing the best football Hunter has ever seen him play . 
“He looks better than ever,” 
Hunter said. “He looks like his shape’s getting there. From toward the end of last year to now, I’d say he’s probably in the best shape he’s been in.”
As helpful as anything is 
the experience the four return-ing starters gained last season. Prior to 2011, only Nixon and Halapio had played significant snaps at UF. 
“From a mental aspect, we’re 
grasping the material a lot bet-ter,” Harrison said. “That’s just helping us focus more on our physicality and technique as an offensive line.”

The women have not competed in the 
4x100m since last June’s NCAA Outdoor 
Championships. Florida placed 18th in the semifinals, running a 44.68 to finish more than a second slower than the last team to qualify for the finals.
But senior Alishea Usery said she feels like 
this year will be different.
“This should be the first year that we 
should be a real good [4x100m team]. So we’re excited to see how it’s going to go,” Usery said. 
Last year’s team consisted of Usery, Dar -
shay Davis, Ebony Eutsey and Danielle Wil-liams. The only difference this year is fresh-man Bria Goodson will be replacing Williams, whose eligibility expired following the 2011 season. 
On Friday, Usery and the rest of her team 
will get their first chance this year to show off their improvements at the Clyde Littlefield Texas Relays. 
“We’ve just been practicing really hard,” 
Usery said. “Since we’re doing all relays, we’ve been practicing hand-offs constantly every day, making sure everyone’s right on their marks.”
In addition to competing in the 4x100m, 
Usery will also be competing in the 4x400m this weekend along with Eutsey. 
“Since we haven’t run the [4x100m] lately, it’s been our [4x400m] that’s made a mark for Florida,” Usery said. “I know that with our [4x400m] that everyone’s going to be out to get us.”
After placing second in 
the Southeastern Confer -
ence Indoor Champion-ships, losing to LSU by .01 of a second, Florida’s talent in the 4x400m is 
no surprise to the other teams. 
Despite being a tar -
get, Usery feels that the Gators still have an advantage over the other teams in both the 4x100m and the 4x400m.
“We always hang out with each other, and I think that’s what really makes a good relay,” Usery said. 
“If you’re friends during practice, you need 
to be friends out of practice so you can know each other and know each other’s weaknesses and know each other’s strengths, so you can use that against certain competition.” 
Coach Mike Holloway often talks about 
how the women met at the beginning of the year to discuss what they were capable of doing and how they were going to improve. Usery, Davis, Goodson and Eutsey hope to see improvements in the 4x100m thanks to their tight bond. 
“We just need chemistry,” Usery said, 
“and if you have chemistry then you’re going to do good and come out on top.”

� UF PLAYS TONIGHT AT 6 IN 
A REMATCH WITH USF.
JONATHAN CZUPRYN
Alligator Writer
 
When Florida pulled out a 3-2 
extra-inning win against South 
Florida on Feb. 12, pitchers Lauren Haeger and Alyssa Bache were a couple of inexperienced wide-eyed freshmen. 
Neither Haeger nor Bache have 
grown into grizzled veterans in time for the Gators’ rematch against the Bulls on Wednesday at 6 p.m., but they certainly have matured in the month and a half since. 
“For me and the other freshmen, 
it was the first couple games of our [first] college season so we didn’t really know what to expect,” Hae-ger said. “I think we’re just more knowledgeable now.”
In the six years coach Tim Wal-
ton has been at UF, he never before had an arsenal of three viable pitch-ers. This season, Walton has relied on both Haeger and Bache to sup-port his No. 1 starter, sophomore Hannah Rogers. 
And each hurler has proven her 
worth, combining to allow just 0.86 earned runs per game, the fourth-best ERA in the country.
“It’s good for all three of us to 
be here,” Bache said. “It’s hard for one pitcher or two pitchers to do, but three pitchers makes the whole team surroundings so much better to play in. I’m thankful for Hannah and Lauren because I couldn’t do this myself.”
Although Rogers is carrying the majority of the pitching load, total-ing 55 percent of the innings pitched this year, she said she needs the freshmen to help her through the rigorous 54-game regular season.
“They’re both focused, they’re 
both mentally prepared when they are out on the mound,” Rogers said. “They matured a lot just going out on the mound, and I think they know what to expect of the hitters and I feel like they are hitting better spots also.”
The two freshmen are a com-
bined 13-1, including a perfect 4-0 mark against notoriously tough Southeastern Conference teams. The only loss came against then-No. 5 Washington on Feb. 23, when Haeger gave up three runs in five innings. 
But Haeger’s only bump in the 
road has not stopped her from col-lecting three SEC Freshman of the Week honors, the most weekly ac-colades of any of her teammates.
And although Bache has not won 
any awards yet, she still leads her team with a 0.24 ERA while holding her opponents to just a .192 batting average. Bache was quick to credit her coach and pitching mentor for the success she has had her fresh-man year.
“Especially coming in as a fresh-
man, you need someone there to pick you up or help you out,” Bache said. “I came in with a lot of confi-dence, but (Rogers) has helped me in SEC (play) and a lot of different tournaments. I owe a lot to her. And all the coaching staff did a great job bringing three great pitchers togeth-er.”
In 2010, Walton brought in then-
freshman Ensley Gammel to pitch alongside Florida great Stephanie Brombacher. After going 13-2 and winning SEC Pitcher of the Week during the year, Gammel looked to be a solid option in the circle. 
However, injuries and Rogers 
upstart 2011 plagued her pitching career and Gammel has not entered the circle at all this year.
The possibility of a similar in-
cident threatens every pitcher, but Haeger and Bache said they don’t focus on it.
“I go for the moment now,” Hae-
ger said. “I’ll take it year by year. But no, I don’t really look to my career in the future. I’m in now; I’m in for it now. I came here to win — now.”Freshmen hurlers helping Florida

16, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, MARCH 28, 2012
Brad Beal, G, Fr.  (3 points)
› SEC: 36 points, 11-of-26 shooting, 15 
rebounds and two steals.NCAA: 63 points, 23-of-38 shooting, 33 
rebounds and six steals.
� 
In the last installment 
of Hot Shots this year, Beal 
takes the final poll thanks to a stellar run through the 
postseason. After almost 
leading Florida to an upset 
of Final Four-bound Kentucky 
in the conference tournament, Beal fo-cused his sights on his first NCAA Tour -
nament. Scoring a team-high 15.8 points per game, Beal never shot less than 50 percent through UF’s four tournament games and helped Florida reach its sec-ond consecutive Elite Eight.HOT SHOTS
Erik Murphy, F,  Jr.   (2 points)
     ›SEC: 39 points, 14-of-23 shoot-
ing, six rebounds and three 
blocks.
NCAA: 36 points, 13-of-33 
shooting, 29 rebounds and 
six blocks.
� Murphy’s tough play inside 
and strong work on the boards 
came as a pleasant surprise. Murphy put up 
lackluster rebounding numbers all season up until the NCAA Tournament, when he hauled in 7.5 rebounds per game during Florida’s Elite Eight run. Though he was besting his season average by more than three boards, Murphy also continued to be an integral part of the Ga-
tors’ scoring offense.Kenny Boynton, G, Jr.  (1 point)
› SEC: 16 points, 4-of-18 shooting, six assists 
and two steals.
NCAA: 51 points, 16-of-43 shooting, 17 as-sists and three steals.
� Boynton rebounded from 
a woeful SEC Tournament 
with four solid showings in The Big Dance. Though his shooting numbers dipped in UF’s second-round win against Virginia and then again against Marquette in the Sweet 16, Boynton stayed involved in the of-fense by dishing out an averaged of 4.3 assists through UF’s four tournament games. Boynton finally put together a 20-point night against Norfolk State while also snagging a career-high eight rebounds to go along with his four assists.Postseason
SEC Tournament: W – Alabama, L – Kentucky
NCAA Tournament: W – Virginia, W – Norfolk State, 
W – Marquette, L – Louisville
STANDINGS:
1. Brad Beal (18 points) 2 . Kenny Boynton (10 points) Tie-3 . Erik Murphy (5 points) Tie-3 . Erving Walker (5 points) 5. Patric Young (4 points) 6. Will Yeguete (1 point)
Season Champion: Brad Beal  (18 points)
› 546 points (14.8 ppg), 175-of-393 shooting (44.5 field goal percentage), 249 rebounds (6.7 rpg) and 51 steals (1.4 spg)
� This one wasn’t even close. While Boynton finished as UF’s leading scorer, there is no question Beal was the Gators’ most valuable player through -
out SEC play and into March Madness. After Will Yeguete was lost for the season, Beal willingly slid over to play power forward despite the fact he 
was already playing out of position as a small forward. He embraced the challenge and went on to overtake Patric Young as UF’s leading rebounder. Beal also led the team in steals and was arguably the top defender. If and when he makes the jump to the NBA — the deadline to announce for the draft is April 10 — whichever team selects him will know it is getting a complete player. Beal shot at a 60.5 percent clip in the NCAA Tournament, and while he has the option of staying another season, Beal’s final stat line is likely one that won’t be repeated anytime soon by a Gators freshman.
