A growing association between the drug nicknamed 
molly and electronic music is leaving local artists and fans 
annoyed.
Recently, the drug was the suspected cause of three 
deaths leading to the cancellation of the ﬁ  nal day of the Elec-
tric Zoo festival in New York and the Zedd performance at 
House of Blues Boston.
Molly is a crystalline powder form of MDMA, regard-
ed commonly as Ecstasy, which causes a euphoric rush of serotonin to the brain, said Paul Doering, a UF pharmacy professor.
The national attention following these occurrences wor-
ries some who work locally in the electronic music scene.
“For the people involved in the industry, we’re con-
cerned,” lighting and sound technician Keenan Kan said. “We have seen it happen before. Similar situations hap-pened when this music was popular in the ‘90s, and of course, Gainesville and other communities acted on it and stomped out the scene.”

The BlueLight app for smartphones has 
come to UF.
Preet Anand, founder of BlueLight, said 
the need for the app came after he realized the 
Blue Light emergency phone system poles that 
litter campuses around the country weren’t enough to keep students feeling safe, as most 
incidents occur off campus.
“You tap your phone’s screen a few times 
and help is on the way,” he said. “Even if you don’t want to call the police, you can send your girlfriend or your roommate a message letting them know where you are.”
After installing the free app and selecting 
three emergency contacts, users input the name of their university, allowing the app to 
call the local police department whenever the 
user is in danger. Tapping “campus safety” in the app menu connects users to the police and transmits the phone’s GPS location, while hit-
ting “alert contacts” sends a preset message to 
the user’s contacts with the same GPS infor-mation.
After brainstorming ideas and asking his 
female friends about convenient ways to stay safe, Anand settled on the idea of creating an app for smartphones. He said although many people might leave their wallets or keys at home, most are attached to their smartphones 
at all times.BlueLight app offers UF students safety at night

UF has once again been ranked by the organization Teach 
for America as one of the top contributors of graduating se-
niors to the program.
UF ranked ﬁ  fth on the list of large schools, behind the 
University of Texas at Austin, the University of Southern California, the University of California, Berkeley and the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. About 60 UF gradu-ates were accepted into the program, said Shawnee Cohn, spokeswoman for the organization.
“Teach for America is a nonproﬁ  t dedicated to expand-
ing opportunities for kids growing up in poverty,” she said. “We recruit recent college graduates and professionals to teach in high-need public schools across the country.”Teach for America is a highly competitive program. Only 
14 percent of about 57,000 applicants in 2013 were accepted. Cohn called UF  “consistently a top contributor” to the pro-gram.
Hana Engroff is one such applicant. The UF alumna was 
accepted into the prestigious program last year and current-ly works for the San Antonio Independent School District. Two other Teach for America Gator graduates also work in San Antonio, Engroff said. 
“It’s deﬁ  nitely a worthwhile organization, but it’s not for 
the weak,” the 21-year-old said. “You have to be committed,  and you have to love the kids.”UF ranked No. 5 graduate contributor to Teach for AmericaSEE EDM, PAGE 4SEE BLUE, PAGE 4The kettlebell

In the past, the 20 acres of property at 
5805 NW 37th St. has been synonymous 
with the controversy associated with Terry 
Jones and the Dove World Outreach Cen-
ter.
Thursday, however, a new chapter 
began for the land as the Spirit of Faith 
church officially opened its doors.
Kenneth Claytor, senior pastor of Spirit 
of Faith, said he hopes to turn what was 
considered a negative area into something positive.
“At one time, this property that we sit 
in today was used as a place that divided the city,” he said. “Controversial things were taking place here, and there was a 
level of paranoia and fear. However, I feel 
that our God-given assignment is to take that which was a negative and now make it something that’s positive for our city.”
Claytor said even though he originally 
didn’t plan to purchase the property, he felt that God had called him to use the area to promote the church’s platform and help the community find peace.
“We want to turn something that was 
confusion into peace, and turn something that was considered by some hateful into love,” he said.
In July, Spirit of Faith bought the prop-
erty for about $1.2 million. 
Renovations to the building are only 
about 60 percent finished, said Claytor. 
Future plans for the property include 
the addition of another ministry facility, an orphanage and education centers.
Gainesville Chief of Police Tony Jones 
called the opening a “joyous occasion.”
He said the Gainesville police force 
stands firmly behind the new church.
“My relationships with this building in 
the past has not been pleasant … because 
what went on on these particular grounds 
not only impacted Gainesville and the State of Florida but this entire world,” Jones said. “Today I see hope, and the Gainesville Police Department stands with 
you for anything you need.”
Mayor Ed Braddy attended the open-
ing and participated in a ribbon-cutting 
ceremony. 
He was joined by City Commissioner 
Randy Wells, City Commissioner Yvonne Hinson-Rawls and City Commissioner Lauren Poe at the opening.
Braddy, who once lived in a house 
neighboring the property, said the new oc-cupant’s mission to unite diverse groups of people should bring both comfort and 
relief to residents.
“As diverse as we are, we all have this 
yearning for meaning and an innate desire for purpose,” he said. “More urgently than ever, we need the great institutions of faith 
to provide the leadership and provide the venue to heal spiritual wounds.” FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 13, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 3

Even though it’s not gameday, 
students will still be tailgating on 
campus.
UF RecSports is hosting its an-
nual cornhole tournament at 5 p.m. 
today at the Broward Outdoor Rec-
reational Complex.
Matt Thalhamer, event coordina-
tor of the tournament and program assistant for competitive sports, said the game is popular now that it is tailgating season.
Thalhamer said there will be a 
stereo playing with country music 
to add to the tailgate theme.
“The tournament is a way to in-
troduce students to the sport and 
become aware for tailgates this Fall,” Thalhamer said.
Forty-eight students are ex-
pected to attend. The event turnout is about on par with last year, he said.
The single-elimination style 
tournament consists of two-person teams with a total of 24 teams. The winning team of the cornhole tour-nament will be given intramural 
champion T-shirts.
Thalhamer said this year is dif-
ferent from previous years because 
it will be held outdoors.
David King, a 20-year-old UF 
mechanical engineering junior, said he’s hoping that his opponent will not like the heat and use it to his own advantage.
King participated in last year’s 
cornhole tournament and said he’s excited to return.

said.Cornhole tournament today

Florida’s Board of Gov-
ernors is giving UF $1.7 mil-
lion in performance funding, it announced at its meeting 
Thursday.
The board had $20 million 
total to allocate between the schools in the state university 
system. The amount of fund-ing each school received was determined based on three metrics: cost per degree, av-
erage salaries of graduates 
and percentage of gradu-ates who are employed or continuing their education. 
UF’s numbers were $25,028, 
$32,176 and 63 percent, re-spectively, according to a state document.
“We worked with the Leg-
islature to deliver a win for students and Florida univer-sities,” Gov. Rick Scott said in a press release. “Our goal 
for supporting students was 
to ensure they can find a job and pursue their dreams af-ter school. That’s why these millions of dollars are based 
on our institutions’ effective-
ness in preparing our stu-dents for the future.”
Six schools got more fund-
ing than UF. The Univer-sity of Central Florida and University of South Florida got the most, at $2.6 million each. New College of Florida had the lowest amount — $435,000.
Scott said in the release 
administrators should use the money to “enhance their universities” so they can at-tract talent and create edu-
cational environments for 
students.
In the future, the board 
will use more metrics that 
center around student suc-
cess for evaluation.Board of Governors giving

“We wanted to create the quickest way for stu-
dents to get help when they needed it,” he said.
Christina Bonarrigo, UF Student Body President 
and 22-year-old graduate business management stu-
dent, started the initiative for a UF BlueLight app but 
was unaware that one was available. She said she is 
selecting from three prospects for a UF-centric app.
Daniel Winslow, a 19-year-old UF pre-pharmacy 
sophomore, said he’s always felt safe on campus, 
even when he’s walking home from classes at night.
Winslow said although the Blue Light poles scat-
tered around campus are helpful to fearful students, they aren’t spaced well enough to truly keep a person safe.
“A lot of things could happen between the three or 
four poles I see around,” he said. “This app could be a 
good replacement.”
Sravga Kidambi, a 17-year-old UF telecommuni-
cation freshman, said because the app is free there’s 
no reason not to download it.
“I would think that someone would just call 911 if 
they’re in danger,” she said. “But I guess the app is a cooler way to do it.”The app is free, 
can call policeDavid Efraim,  a 22-year-old UF ac-
counting graduate student and DJ, said 
drug incidents at EDM festivals can rein-force the stereotype linking the genre to molly.  He said he watched a 16-year-old 
girl overdose at Ultra Music Festival in 
Miami in 2009.
“It looks bad on me,” he said. “Drugs 
and music have been related since before Woodstock. The only difference now is that it’s a much larger scale, and it’s kids doing it.”
But Doering said molly isn’t new and 
is not exclusive to any one subculture.
He said the drug doesn’t generally 
cause death. When it does, it raises the question of whether users were even tak-ing molly at all.
Doering said that while doing work 
as a consultant for a police case in Or-lando, he saw firsthand what could hap-pen when people take drugs that are not what they think they are.
“The guy took what turned out to be 
contaminated MDMA,” Doering said, adding that it contained a byproduct causing the man’s body temperature to rise to 107 degrees.
Doering said friends placed the man 
in a bathtub and doused him with ice and water, but his body was still 105 de-grees two hours after his death.
It is no secret that drugs are seen as a 
major part of EDM culture, Kan said, but this isn’t always the case for people who are truly fans of the music.
“You don’t need to take some pill to 
make you feel good,” he said. “When you’re listening to the music, you al-ready feel good.”

With a nod to health concerns 
and latest fads, authentic mom-
and-pop staples are conforming to sleek and retro bistro styles. But change isn’t always a good 
thing, some Gainesville residents 
say.
Humble Alachua County eat-
eries, such as Pearl Country Store and Barbecue in Micanopy, like to stay true to their culinary roots.
Manager Damon Scott said he 
will never leave his “mini Crack-er Barrel” ways, but has added health-conscious options like vegan burgers.
Rachel Graf, a 19-year-old UF 
health science and pre-physical therapy sophomore, has contra-
dicting opinions on moderniza-
tion of classic businesses.
“I’m kind of skewed because I 
love “Restaurant Impossible” on the Food Network,” she said. “It shows that on the business side of things, it’s smart to update for a wider variety and customer pool. But, it’s important to make the food the same, just change the 
presentation.”
Even franchises aren’t into the 
updating game.
Matt Aschenbrener, manager 
of the Maki-style sushi hangout 
How Do You Roll? said companies have to maintain their ground.
“We can’t try to be Sushi Chao 
or anybody else,” he said.
Ty McDuffie, an employee at Patticakes, a family-owned coffee shop in Gainesville, touts small business.
“I strongly support it,” said 
the 20-year-old UF engineering junior. “They go out of their way to be unique, whether by using lo-cal ingredients or just trying new things, because the owners prob-ably didn’t go to business school, and that’s OK.”
Danny Zeenberg, bar manager 
and assistant general manager of The Swamp, said modifying the 
menu isn’t necessary to keep cus-
tomers returning. 
“The trendy restaurants will 
get the initial push by custom-ers because they are new. But, then newer places will spring up and automatically be the best,” he said. “Now, you don’t have a competitive edge anymore. It’s 
best to just stay classically you.”

Gainesville Police arrested a local 
man Wednesday after he repeatedly 
masturbated in two restaurants.
Officers arrested Prince Simmons, 
27, on charges of stalking, loitering and prowling, exposure of sexual organs and resisting an officer without violence.
For the last few months, a Planet 
Smoothie employee had been reporting to police that Simmons went into the business — located at 1620 W. Universi-ty Ave. — and masturbated while look-
ing at her on multiple occasions, wrote 
GPD spokesman Officer Ben Tobias in an email.Then, on Tuesday, police responded 
to EndZone Bar and Grill, located at 1209 W. University Ave., on a report that Simmons was masturbating at the res-
taurant, Tobias wrote. When officers arrived, he ran away. 
On Wednesday, 
police found and ar-
rested Simmons just before 9 p.m. During questioning, he ad-mitted to all incidents 
of masturbation. Police also obtained EndZone surveillance video which con-firmed that Simmons masturbated at the restaurant.
Officers booked Prince into the Ala-
chua County Jail at about 9:30 p.m. Wednesday, where he remained Thurs-day night with a $50,000 bond.Man arrested for

Every Thursday morning for two hours, 
the Rev. James Dixon of Greater Faith Baptist 
Fellowship downtown travels to the Alachua County Jail.
He enters a classroom where he talks with 
inmates, helping them prepare to re-enter everyday life — and the job market — after they’re released.
But a major topic of discussion that came 
up at a meeting about Dixon’s Bridges to Prosperity program last week was finding more work for inmates eligible for work re-lease programs, Gainesville resident Herb Kieklak wrote in a recent email to city com-missioners.
Walter Cason, executive director of the 
Brave Overt Leaders of Distinction program for former inmates, agreed reentry programs need help expanding.
“We need more support,” Cason said. 
“This is ... for young men to reclaim their place in society.”
During the summer, Dixon expanded 
his Bridges to Prosperity re-entry program, which focuses on financial stability and goal-setting, from a downtown meeting place into 
the county jail.
The expansion was at the request of Kris-
ten Benedini, director of an inmate transition 
program that existed at the jail prior to Dix-on’s program. She asked Dixon to step in and implement Bridges to Prosperity at the jail because it would complement hers, which helps inmates develop resumes, among other services.
Because of support inmates receive from 
these programs, Dixon said, they have the opportunity to become functioning members of society upon release.
“Before, I asked them, ‘How many of you 
all never thought you could achieve your dreams?’” Dixon said. “They all raised their hands. But, now, they know they can.”Inmate programs seek expansion

� RESEARCH WAS BASED ON SURVEYS 
FROM THE 1950s, 1960s AND 1970s.

A recent study suggests that LSD might actually be 
good for you — what a trip.
Researchers Pål-Ørjan Johansen and Teri Krebs from 
Norway’s University of Science and Technology wrote 
that, “there were no significant associations between 
lifetime use of any psychedelics ... or past year use of 
LSD and increased rate of any of the mental health out-comes.”
In fact, they wrote, it found psychedelic use was as-
sociated with a lower rate of mental health problems, ac-cording to the science journal PLOS One.
Johansen’s and Krebs’ conclusions about LSD and 
alcoholism were based on archived surveys from the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. Fifty-nine percent of patients 
who had been given a dose of LSD had either stopped 
drinking completely or were drinking less, according to www.dailymail.co.uk.
This study starkly contrasts the popular opinion that 
LSD, as well as other hallucinogenic drugs, can cause long-term mental health issues.
“The LSD that was being abused in the ‘60s and the 
‘70s was a much different drug in terms of dosage than what is being used now,” said Dr. Bruce Goldberger, professor and director of UF Health Forensic Medicine.
The dosage was probably two to four times higher 
than what it is today, he said.
The study also suggested that the drug could be used 
to treat alcohol addiction, and the researchers concluded that it is effective against alcoholism.
“I would be reluctant to use a drug like LSD to treat 
alcoholism,” Goldberger said. “You’re treating one drug with a high potential for abuse with another drug with a 
high potential of abuse.”
Even if it did become an accepted form of treatment, 
it would be impossible to regulate, he said.
Gabriela Asuaje, a 20-year-old UF advertising senior, 
said she would never consider taking the drug even if it 
is proved to be beneficial.
“I actually had a friend from high school that was in 
rehab and got addicted to LSD, so I don’t really consider that it would be a means to treat people,” she said. “I 
think there are other ways.”LSD might be 
good for mental health, study says

Two short public service announce-
ments were released Wednesday en-
couraging students to intervene dur-ing an alcohol-related sexual assault attempt.
Maureen Miller, director of Gator-
Well Health Promotions, said the vid-eos were created by Gainesville Police, GatorWell, University Police, the Ala-chua County Sheriff’s Office, Santa Fe College, the Alachua County Victim Services & Rape Crisis Center and the Student Health Care Center.
The two videos were in the works 
for more than a year and are now circu-lating via social media.The take-home message from the 
videos is to have students feel like they can do something if they see sexual as-sault, Miller said.
“If you just look at a situation and 
something just doesn’t look right, you can step in and help out a fellow per-
son,” she said.
Lynne Benck, captain of the inves-
tigations bureau, said the beginning of every semester, especially Fall, is when 
there is an increase in the number of re-ported sexual assaults.
“In the last two weeks we have prob-
ably had three or four open cases that are related to alcohol-facilitated sexual assault,” she said.
Andrea Pedata, a UF 21-year-old 
criminology and anthropology junior said, she’s been in that situation before.
“I would’ve rather had someone step 
in for me and act like my best friend and take me somewhere,” she said. 
Benck said one night should not end 
up changing someone’s life.
“You guys are one Student Body, so 
watch out for each other and try to pre-
vent sexual assault by just being aware 
of your surroundings,” she said.PSAs warn of alcohol-related assaults
“If you just look at a 
situation and something just 
doesn’t look right, you can 
step in and help out a fellow 
person.”

Darts & Laurels
Yesterday, Russian President Vladimir Putin wrote an 
editorial for The New York Times describing his opinion on what should be done in Syria.
“We must stop using the language of force and return to 
the path of civilized diplomatic and political settlement,” he wrote.
He also described his relations with President Barack 
Obama as “marked by growing trust.” Of course, some peo-ple don’t appreciate being lectured on democracy by the au-tocratic former KGB ofﬁ  cial.
Whether you agree or disagree with what Putin wrote, 
it was a bold move to publish the editorial in an American 
newspaper. It reinforced his point about the need for civilized 
discourse and his willingness to strengthen Russia’s relation-ship with the U.S. For that, we’re giving Putin a we’ll-accept-
that-olive-branch LAUREL.
Next, we’re throwing a seriously-just-stop DART to noted 
bigot and former Gainesville resident, the Rev. Terry Jones. 
Jones was arrested in Polk County after police found him rid-ing a car with a smoker full of 2,998 kerosene-soaked Qurans attached to the back. His organization, Dove World Outreach 
Center, had planned to burn the books in a park.
We’d like to remind Jones of one of Martin Luther King 
Jr.’s most eloquent quotes: “Returning hate for hate multi-
plies hate, adding deeper darkness to a night already devoid 
of stars.” When are you going to learn, Jones?
Yesterday, Harry Potter fans rejoiced when news broke 
that J.K. Rowling will be making her screenwriting debut 
with a Harry Potter spin-off ﬁ  lm. The ﬁ  lm will be based on the ﬁ  ctional author of “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find 
Them,” Newt Scamander.
A LAUREL for you, J.K. Rowling, you go, J.K. Rowling! 
Look at you, gettin’ back in the saddle and doin’ new things. 
We’ll be in the front row at the premiere — probably some-
time in the year 2025 or so.
Finally, a DART to all the haters criticizing “Wrecking 
Ball” because it’s a damn-good song, and Miley Cyrus looks 
great in the video. Sure, the whole “screw-you-dad-it’s-not-a-phase” attitude is still pretty obnoxious, but her new look and 
sound is starting to grow on us. 
So this weekend, don’t be afraid to belt that chorus with 
the windows of your car rolled down — we know it’s stuck in your head.
Have a lovely weekend!

Vote or post a message at www.alligator.orgThursday’s question: Have you ever had 
an extremely bad professor?Today’s question: Does EDM unfairly get a bad rep? US should intervene in Syrian civil war
In his speech on Tuesday, President Barack Obama 
argued that the United States is not the global police force. 
However, the situation in Syria remains tumultuous, 
and the White House seems to believe that the only im-
perative is securing chemical weapons despite earlier de-
mands for Bashar al-Assad’s resignation. 
From a geopolitical perspective, it is clear that in-
tervention in Syria is not only necessary but also inevi-
table.  
The Syria we know today was sculpted by a callous 
French architect after World War I. 
Unfortunately, the French failed to account for the 
complexity of the Middle East’s rich history and diver-sity. 
Sunni, Shiite and Alawite Muslims and Christian Ar-
abs were housed together with a religious and ethni-
cally different Kurdish people in the Levant. 
More than 90 years later, the unstable lines drawn 
by the French are witnessing a civil war where, accord-
ing to www.CNN.com, the ruling Alawite Assad family faces the Sunni Free Syrian Army, and both factions are 
brutally sinister. 
However, the belligerents of the conﬂ  ict aren’t mono-
lithic — there is a plethora of sectarian alliances on the 
ground in Syria. 
For example, last month an Al-Jazeera report de-
clared that the Shiite group Hezbollah was ofﬁ  cially backing the Assad government. 
Hezbollah  — which, according to the U.S State De-
partment, has been an ofﬁ  cial terrorist organization since 1997— is bolstered by a predominantly Shiite Iran. 
On the other hand, an NBC report published this 
week warns of the radical elements of the Free Syrian 
Army, speciﬁ  cally al-Qaida. 
With such a complex and hostile environment, it’s obvious why Obama and 
Washington policymakers are hesitant about intervention in 
Syria. Instead, U.S. ofﬁ  cials 
have used words like “limited” and “surgical” when referring to intervention in the fractured 
Levant. 
If the U.S. does not inter-
vene, there will be severe consequences in terms of hu-
man rights. 
According to The Hufﬁ  ngton Post, more than 110,000 
people have already died as a result of the conﬂ  ict, and an often-neglected horror of the civil war is the use of mass rape. 
The number of refugees illustrates just how dire the 
situation has become. 
The United Nations reported that nearly 2 million 
people have ﬂ  ed Syria. 
This creates regional instability as well, as Syrians 
seek a new home in neighboring countries such as Tur-
key and Iraq. 
So, if there are both idealist and realist reasons for 
intervening in Syria, and a limited strike will not suf-
ﬁ  ce, what is the solution? The answer is intervention. 
Because there is no moral authority on the ground in 
Syria, the U.S. must intervene as it did when there was no authority in Kosovo. 
Ideally, Syria should be Balkanized, therefore re-
shaping the arbitrary political liens that the French cre-
ated. This would give a home to every group of people 
living in Syria. 
Intervention will consolidate the U.S. role in the 
world as a leader and end a humanitarian crisis, deliv-
ering a decisive blow to al-Assad and his sponsors.

Imagine a program that promised the op -
portunity to change your life: the opportunity 
to work side by side with some of Gainesville’s most successful business leaders in creating a mock company. Imagine — after applying to more places than you can count, going on in-terview after interview and struggling to find a job much less a living wage — that someone of-fered you the chance to change your career path. Then, imagine the bad news: that for no logical or rational reason, 25 percent of you would be randomly and summarily rejected.
The StartUp Quest program promised that 
participants would work in small groups with 
a mentor, and over the course of 10 weeks the 
participants would learn what it takes to start a company from scratch. The core of the company is built around an innovative technology bor-rowed from the University of Florida’s Office of Technology and Licensing, a program partner.
The skills, experience and contacts participants were supposed to learn in starting 
this simulated company were sup-posed to be substantial. It was to be an invaluable asset in helping the participants to get a job or even start their own company. For someone like me, who’s been looking for a better career opportu-nity for months now, the program sounded per-
fect. It sounded like the answer to my prayers.
Funded by a grant from the Department of 
Labor to study how effective the program is at 
returning workers to the workforce, it was de-termined that not everyone accepted would ac-tually be able to actively engage in the program. Because the program was funded by a study, it needed a control group to compare to the effects of the program on the program participants. As 
a result, we were told that one in every four of 
us would be part of this inactive control group. 
The members of this control group would be 
participants without actually being able to par-ticipate. The chance to attend the educational sessions and work one-on-one with Gainesville’s best and brightest minds wouldn’t be available to that 25 percent. Not only would we not be able to participate, but because 
we would be technically “participating” the first time around, we would not be eligible to partici-pate in the future either. The lack of alternatives 
was even more frustrating. If anyone dropped 
from the program, his or her slot would remain unfilled. 
It seems wrong. It seems unethical and im-
moral. Although the program may not be exact-ly fraudulent, and although those who actually get to participate will no doubt benefit, after all the promises of what this program would do for me, I can’t feel help but feel that those promises 
were empty. 
I’m sure they wouldn’t say that their actions 
were fraudulent, but for me and many others in 
Gainesville, it sure felt like it.
Steven Craig is a UF alumnus.Like most Americans, I am able to vividly recall the events that took place 12 years ago. It was my last year of high school, and a friend and I decided to leave study hall to hang out in the library.
As we waltzed in, laughing and joking, I remember being hushed, and 
our attention shifted to the TV. I was just 17 years old — there was no way 
to comprehend the magnitude of devastation that tore through our nation 
that morning. I don’t need to explain the wave of emotions that followed. Sixteen months later, I was standing on the famous yellow footprints of the Marine Corps Recruit Training Depot Parris Island. Two years after entering recruit training, I was deployed to Fallujah, Iraq, one of the most volatile battlegrounds of the Iraq war up to that point. By now, most read-ers are probably asking, “What is the point of this editorial?” I digress.
Firehouse Subs boasts its motto as being “Founded by Firemen.” It 
prides itself on asking customers to donate their change on purchases, and 
in return the company donates funds and equipment to first responders. 
Great company, right? Firemen giving back to firefighters. However, this is the second year I am aware of that this company has forgotten about the attacks of Sept. 11.
Last year on Sept. 11, I wandered into Firehouse Subs and realized there wasn’t a single sign, banner, flier or printed state-ment reminding patrons of the significance of the day. I spoke with the manager, and although he was sympathetic, he said he had no control over what gets displayed. That evening I emailed the 
company to express my disappointment, and still a year later I’ve yet to receive a reply. 
Second to the victims in the Twin Towers, firefighters and first re-
sponders were the first to lay down their lives in terrific acts of bravery. It wasn’t until a year later that military began to witness their casualties. How can a company who says they are “Founded by Firemen” fail to give even the slightest remembrance to the heroes who were first on scene?
The United States of America was forever changed by the events that 
took place on that fatal day, but America made a promise to “Never For-
get” — to always remember that terror is real, and we’re not invincible. 
We must also remember the brave individuals who, in a moment’s notice, were willing to sacrifice their lives for others.

Speaking OutOpen call to ACCENT: 
Bring Noam Chomsky
Thanks to its long con-
nection to famed linguist 
and author Noam Chom-
sky, a renowned speaker 
to worldwide audiences, the Civic Media Center was able to give UF’s ACCENT 
Speaker’s Bureau a chance 
to present professor Chom-sky on the UF campus this Fall. In 2003, with ACCENT co-sponsorship, Chomsky 
spoke at the O’Connell Cen-
ter to 6,000 people.
We hoped a similar event 
could be scheduled this year 
on Oct. 16. In June, ACCENT 
chair Daniel Landesberg was notified of this golden oppor-tunity and initially seemed interested, but as the months 
went on, nothing was final-
ized. ACCENT stated that since they believed only 1,000 students would attend, 
the event should be in the 
Phillips Center for the Per-forming Arts and on a differ-ent date, as Oct. 16 was not available there.
An information table was 
set up for two hours on the Plaza of Americas on Aug. 28 with a simple 2-by-3 sign 
that read: “Chomsky is Com-
ing” — because he is. 
Exactly where he’ll be 
speaking is the question. About 56 people left mes-
sages supporting Chomsky’s 
appearance, and a photo and email were sent to ACCENT demonstrating student inter-
est. 
Instead, a week later, AC-
CENT sent an email saying 
they would not be bringing Chomsky this year because 
our tabling had given ad-
vance publicity before the contract was signed. 
This was six weeks before 
this major event, and more than 10 weeks since they were first made aware of it. 
We think, as in 2003, there 
is a lot of interest in Chom-
sky, and it would be a shame 
to let the chance for a large audience to see him slip away. 
We encourage ACCENT 
to change its decision and give this important figure a venue at which to speak.

Health science sophomore Lindsey Meeks, 19, demonstrates a side plank using a kettlebell at 
the Southwest Recreation Center on Thursday. Using kettlebells has become a workout trend.
� CROSSFIT POPULARIZED IT.

Alligator Contributing Writer
As high-intensity workout programs 
are catching on nationwide, so are ket-
tlebells, and Gainesville has welcomed 
them with swinging arms.
“Everyone comes in the gym ask-
ing if we have them,” said Sean Walsh, 
manager at Bailey’s Powerhouse Gym 
on West University Avenue. “They’re 
deﬁ  nitely in high demand.”
Walsh attributes the local popularity 
of the originally cast-iron weighted balls from 18th century Russia to the popular-
ity of programs like CrossFit, which in-
corporate the equipment into workouts.
Some of the people coming in asking 
for the kettlebell don’t even know what 
it is, he said.
Joslyn Ahlgren, a lecturer in the UF Applied Physiology & Kinesiology de-
partment, said the growing popularity of kettlebells resembles other ﬁ  tness trends. 
Once high-proﬁ  le programs publicize a 
method, those pieces of equipment be-come more commonplace. 
“Once you get it in the right hands, 
somebody will really get it going,” she 
said.
Adam Huff, a personal trainer in 
Newberry, said he thinks kettlebells are 
gaining traction because it’s a welcome 
variation. 
“It’s something new and out of the 
ordinary,” he said. “Something different 
than just dumbbells.”
But Ahlgren said kettlebells are rap-
idly becoming everyday items. 
“It used to be you would never see 
something like the kettlebell just hang-
ing out on a shelf at the gym,” Ahlgren 
said. “Now, they are just as common as a dumbbell.” Kettlebell trend swings

The Doris Bardon Community Cultural 
Center is looking for a new place to call home.
The center, currently located at 716 N. Main 
St., has offered art classes and cultural events 
for the past two years, but the current location is not ideal, said Mallory O’Connor, a board member of the Arts Association of Alachua County. She said it doesn’t offer enough park-
ing for the artists or visitors hoping to attend 
events or classes.
O’Connor said the center’s current lease ex-
pires Oct. 6, and she said board members are looking for a low-cost downtown facility, ide-ally before the lease is up.
O’Connor wrote in an email to City Com-
missioner Lauren Poe that similar not-for-
proﬁ  t organizations in other cities have been 
able to rent city or county spaces for as little as a $1 per year.In the email, O’Connor wrote that she and 
Poe had discussed a possible long-term loca-tion in the South Main Street area as a part of a “revitalization effort.”
In the meantime, Norma Homan, the orga-
nization’s treasurer, said some groups like im-prov theater group Mad About the Doris have relocated temporarily. 
“We will use different venues for a short 
time,” Homan said. “It will just mean that we do business a little differently for a short while.”The Doris community center seeks to relocate, asks city for help

Former UF setter Sundai Weston hits the ball during Florida’s 3-0 win against Florida A&M on Aug. 25, 2012, in the O’Connell Center.
This week’s edition of the alliga-
torSports Brand Picks Column finds 
our crew soul-searching, desperate 
for meaning in our lives. 
We’re talking about the bye 
week, the time each year where we 
find out just how much covering the 
Gators consumes our otherwise pa-
thetic lives. 
WE HAVE NOTHING WITH-
OUT THIS. 
No Brent Pease press conference 
on Tuesday? Uh, well, there’s not much to do after going to Tijuana Flats. 
No D.J. Durkin on Wednesday? 
Is there a taco deal in Gainesville on Wednesdays? 
Maybe we should go to the li-
brary (Which building is that?) and study for a change. 
Nah. We’ll just watch some foot-
ball instead. 
The biggest game on our televi-
sion sets will be the Alabama-Texas 
A&M matchup, debated by Adam 
Lichtenstein and Adam Pincus — two guys who literally have nothing else meaningful to do since UF is off this weekend.
The Aggies (+8) will make it 
déjà vu all over again for the Crim-son Tide because…
Of a young man named Johnny 
Football. The autograph-signin’, reckless-tweetin’ and Heisman-win-nin’ gunslinger will continue the Mi-ami Dolphins’ love affair with Texas 
A&M, beating Nick Saban and beat-
ing him good. There’s room for two former Aggies quarterbacks in Sun Life Stadium next year, right?

She never minded wearing a mask. She did it for four 
years.
Each time she took the floor at the Lemerand Center, 
she imitated each aspect of the next opponent’s offense.
Tennessee. Kentucky. Texas. Stanford. Penn State. 
For the sake of Florida’s success, Sundai Weston played 
whatever role she was told to play in practice from 2009 to 
2012 in order for her team to succeed come game time.
But the former Gators setter is just that. A former set-
ter.
So as No. 5 Florida (5-1) prepared all week for tonight’s 
matchup against Georgetown (4-4) at 7, coach Mary Wise relied on the current backup setters, Dana Backlund and Mackenzie Dagostino, to prepare the Gators during prac-
tice.
Despite just two years of combined collegiate experi-
ence between Backlund and Dagostino, Wise said she feels 
comfortable with those two taking Weston’s former role while also having starting senior setter Taylor Brauneis 
help scout as well.
“The beauty of having three setters in the program (is) 
we have some more flexibility,” she said. “The depth of 
our team allows us to have any combination of six (play-ers) on a court that will make us better.”
With right-handers Backlund and Brauneis along with 
left-hander Dagostino, the Gators can cover all the bases when mimicking an opponent’s playing style the week be-fore a match.Setters replace

After a strong performance two weeks 
ago at the Western Carolina Invitational, 
Florida looks to carry its momentum back 
home to Gainesville for the 2013 Mountain Dew Invitational. 
Although the Gators had the two top 
individual performers in Cullowhee, N.C., 
the low times were not the key takeaway 
from the meet, according to coach Paul Spangler. 
“The biggest positive I took away from 
that race were our fifth runners,” Spangler said. “Something that’s going to be key for us as we progress later in the season is how 
close our fifth runner is to our fourth run-
ner.”
For the men, the fifth 
runner was SEC Men’s 
Freshman of the Week 
Carlos Miranda. 
Miranda finished about 
9 seconds behind Florida’s fourth runner, junior John-
Logan Hines. 
“Hats off to him (for 
winning SEC Men’s Freshman of the Week) in his first collegiate race,” Spangler said. 
Senior Stephanie Strasser was the wom-
en’s fifth runner at Western Carolina. Her time of 11:11.28 would have won last year’s WCU Invitational, which then-Florida-freshman Julie Macedo won with a time of 
11:14.40. 
“On the women’s side, I’m extremely 
pleased with where we’re at right now,” 
Spangler said. 
“We have to continue to train, get better 
and get ready for the big meets that come up later in the season.”
Leading the pack for Florida at the WCU 
Invitational were Mark Parrish and South-
eastern Conference Women’s Runner of the 
Week redshirt senior Agata Strausa. 
Parrish finished the 5K race with a time 
of 14:50.06. 
Strausa completed a two-mile race in 
10:52.29.Florida preparing for first home meet of 2013

“Watching the Avengers ... watching the Hulk makes me wanna run thru walls” 
Jon Halapio  
UF offensive lineman (@Jhalapio67)On Thursday, the ﬁ  lm and literature worlds were 
rocked by an out-of-the-blue announcement — the 
Harry Potter universe will come back to ﬁ  lm with an adaptation of author J.K. Rowling’s “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.”
A ﬁ  ctional textbook released in 2001, “Fantastic 
Beasts and Where to Find Them” was a lot of fun to read as a child. The book documented all the magical creatures in Harry Potter’s world. Some are seen in the novels. Some are not.
If you’re a big Harry Potter fan like me, then I am 
sure you are just as happy about this ﬁ  lm as I am.
And if you’re as a big of a sports fan as I am, then 
you may be wondering what this book has to do with 
sports.
The answer is not a whole lot — at ﬁ  rst. 
Although Florida does not have any dragons lining 
up to play, I can’t help but draw some comparisons be-tween the magical creatures I read about as a kid and the football players I cover daily.
UF’s running backs: Runespoor. In the Harry Potter 
universe, the Runespoor is a three-headed snake, and each head has its own personality. The left head is the 
planner, the center head is the dreamer and the right 
head is venomous.
Florida sports a veritable stable of running backs, 
featuring Matt Jones, Mack Brown and possibly Kelvin 
Taylor. There’s the Gators’ three-headed monster. 
Each of Florida’s tailbacks brings something differ-
ent to the table. 
Brown is the left head — the planner. When Jones, 
Florida’s projected starter, contracted a viral infection over the summer, Brown came to the rescue of the Gators’ plan. Brown ran for more than 100 yards in 
Florida’s season opener, keeping UF’s strategy of domi-
nating the running game intact.
Jones is the right head — the venom. Although he 
struggled against Miami — understandable for a run-ning back playing his ﬁ  rst game in months in the Flori-da heat — Jones has the ability to deliver a quick, deadly strike to the opposition, like he did against Florida State 
in 2012.
Taylor is the center head — the dreamer. Or rather, 
the focus of Florida fans’ dreams. The narrative writes 
itself. Taylor is the son of former Gators running back Fred Taylor, and he made a solid debut in garbage time against Toledo. Ronald Powell: Acro-
mantula. If you read or watched “Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets”, you remember these bad boys — 
giant, hairy, scary spiders. 
If you’re a quarterback 
and you see Powell run-
ning at you, then you need to make like Harry and Ron 
and get the hell out of there as fast as possible.
Powell has had a strong start to his junior season, 
racking up four tackles behind the line and two sacks — all of that on a surgically repaired ACL.
Powell may be the scariest defender Florida boasts, 
and his facial hair deﬁ  nitely ﬁ  ts for the “hairy” qualiﬁ  -cation. 
Jeff Driskel: House Elf.  Driskel has been bottled up 
— some might say enslaved — by offensive coordina-tor Brent Pease’s run-based offense. But like the Harry Potter universe’s faithful servants, Driskel has taken it in stride. Give Driskel the reigns — or a sock — and set him free, Brent! 
Also, like house elves, Driskel has rather large ears.
Trey Burton: Porgrebin. Another creature that 
is only seen in “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find 
Them,” the Porgrebin is a small Russian animal that fol-lows people and ﬁ  lls them with a sense of despair — the same feeling Florida fans get when Burton lines up in the Wildcat formation.
Florida has used Burton in that package three times 
this season. He has rushed for -3 net yards this year. That is not a good start.
If you’re a Gators fan and don’t dread seeing Burton 
take a snap, then you’ve probably been unconscious since 2010.
Tim Tebow: Tebo. Yes, Tim Tebow no longer plays 
for the Gators, but his inﬂ  uence is still here on the Flor-ida campus — just look at the statues outside of the stadium. Also, the fact that Rowling came up with a creature called a “Tebo” is too good of an opportunity 
to pass up.
There is not much information on the Tebo because 
the creature never appears in a book. What I do know 
is that the Tebo is a gray warthog that can make itself invisible, which is ﬁ  tting because Tebow is virtually in-visible to NFL teams.14, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 13, 2013

Southeastern Conference Fresh-
man of the Week Pamela Begic is 
already making an impact for the 
Florida offense this season. 
The freshman has scored two 
goals and is the team’s third-leading 
goal scorer.
“The feeling that you really con-
tribute to the team and to be a part of the team’s success is awesome — indescribable,” Begic said.
The Gators will need Begic to con-
tinue playing well this weekend as they face a pair of undefeated teams. No. 9 Florida (5-1) plays Minnesota (6-0) at James G. Pressly Stadium tonight at 7 and travels to Tampa to play USF (4-0-2) at 6 p.m. on Sunday.
Coach Becky Burleigh said the 
many offensive options on her roster this season can only help the Gators 
become more of a threat.
“It’s a great opportunity because 
teams really can’t key in on one par-
ticular player,” Burleigh said. “Af-ter the ﬁ  rst weekend, teams really wanted to key on Savannah (Jordan); well, that freed up some other people and that’s going to continue all year long.”
Minnesota comes to Gainesville 
after beating LSU and Ole Miss last weekend.“They’ve got to have some con-
ﬁ  dence coming off those two wins,” Burleigh said. “They’re going to face something very different in us, be-cause we don’t play that similarly to LSU or Ole Miss, but at the same time they’ve got to feel pretty good about beating two SEC teams.”
UF’s strategy is patience, and Min-
nesota will test how well that style of 
play holds up.
“They’re re-
ally aggressive,” 
Burleigh said, “and play a pret-
ty high line.” 
Junior midﬁ  elder Katie Thyken 
is one of the threats on the Gophers’ front line. Thyken has scored four 
goals this season, one from a penalty 
kick to help beat Ole Miss.  
But Minnesota won’t provide the 
only challenge this weekend. USF has a roster of 13 players from abroad, including this season’s leading goal scorer Olivia Chance from Tauranga, New Zealand.
Burleigh said every weekend 
brings a new challenge and it can only beneﬁ  t Florida later on this sea-son.
“It’s just like what we’ve talked 
about through all the other games,” Burleigh said. “It’s great preparation to see all these styles before we head into the SEC.”Gators preparing to face two unbeaten opponents this weekend

twitter: @alichtenstein24 Each time was fast enough to secure 
individual victories.
The men may also have an emerging 
force in junior Eddie Garcia. 
At the WCU Invitational, Garcia fin-
ished fourth with a time of 15:14.67, im-
proving his time from a year ago by about 
35 seconds. 
“Eddie really stuck out in that race,” 
Spangler said. 
“I thought he had a breakthrough 
performance. He’s looked really good at practice this year. He had a great summer 
training and certainly things are paying off for him.
“As you get older as a distance runner, 
you see a lot more consistency with their performances. Eddie’s an extremely hard worker. I think he had a better summer 
training this summer than he’s had in the 
past. He’s progressing very well and he’s going to have a great year.”
The men’s team looks to be one of the 
stronger units the Gators have had in years. 
The last time Florida’s men won a con-
ference title was in 1987. 
In recent years, the men have played 
second fiddle to the women, who have won an SEC title three of the last four sea-
sons. 
This year, the men hope to buck the 
trend. Key figures involved in catapulting 
the men to success are Parrish, Hines and 
junior Jimmy Clark.
“Since (the WCU Invitational), JL Hines 
has looked really good in practice,” Span-
gler said. “Mark Parrish, Jimmy Clark ... I’m very pleased with what I’ve seen in 
practice.”
Saturday’s event will give Florida the 
opportunity to have a test run for the SEC 
Champuionships, which will be held at 
the Mark Bostwick Golf Course on Nov. 
1.
“With it being a preview for the SEC 
championships, the SEC will be well represented with LSU, South Carolina, 
Auburn and Tennessee also attending,” 
Spangler said. 
The Mountain Dew Invitational will 
also feature the typical races held at SECs and the much heralded Wisconsin adidas Invitational — a 6K for the women and an 8K for the men. 
“With the men’s race, we’re going 8K 
as normal,” Spangler said. 
“For the women’s race, we’re going to 
break from what we’ve done in the past, which is running 5K, and run a 6K. 6K 
is what we’re going to race at Wisconsin 
and what we’re going to race at the SEC championships, so it’ll be a great opportu-nity for our younger athletes to have that 
experience of a 6K before we get into the 
championship meets later this season.”FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 13, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 15

Now onto the picks!
Leading the pack at 12-4 is alligatorSports Editor Phil “Got 
milk?” Heilman, who expressed his undying and disturb-
ing love of milk during the car ride to Miami last weekend. 
“Sometimes I drink a whole gallon of milk without even real-
izing it,” he said. We can see it now. Phil blacking out in an alley surrounded by empty milk cartons.
Tied for first is Alligator Staff Writer Adam “Wait, what?” 
Pincus, who learned this weekend that roommates do, in fact, share a living space. Sorry, buddy, but all those people who left you behind and said y’all could be still be “secret room-mates” lied to you. We’re here for you ... just somewhere 
else.
Siiting at 11-5  is FightinGators.com’s Cody “No. 2” Jones, 
who, much like Florida’s offense, dropped a deuce last Sat-urday in Sun Life Stadium. Even worse, Cody’s came during 
the national anthem. Show some damn respect.
Next in the standings at 10-6 is Joe “Greatest moment of 
my life” Morgan, who was left looking for a cold shower after learning he could possibly write a review of the new Blu-Ray release of Monsters University. Weird fetish, dude. 
At 9-7 is Thomas “I can only watch so much film” Gold-
kamp, who tweeted about NASCAR and soccer during UF’s bye week. Someone get this guy some new game tape to watch, stat.
Also at 9-7 is Adam “Maybe she’s horny!” Lichtenstein, 
whose dad is more in-tune with the sexual desires of Adam’s girlfriend than he is. Keep your chin up, bud. Those instincts are what got you here. Like father, like son? Perhaps one 
day.
Sitting at .500 with an 8-8 record is the Orlando Sentinel’s 
Edgar “Where the hell is the bathroom?” Thompson, who 
threatened to urinate in a trash can in the Sun Life Stadium 
press box after finding one restroom out of order. Take it 
easy, big fella. Just ask someone where the closest lavatory is next time. 
And in dead-ass last with a piss-poor record of 6-10 is 
Bryan “Tampa sports teams are ruining my life” Holt, who would be ecstatic if the Buccaneers matched that record this season. Don’t worry, bud. At least the Rays are — BAHA-HAHA!Picks , from page 13

Weston played in 85 sets during her UF ca reer
Redshirt senior Chloe Mann said having 
a chance to see what a team will play like 
before actually facing it in a match was vital to Florida’s success the past four years with 
Weston.
But she said she has confidence in this 
year’s scouting team to learn from experi-
ence and continue to help prepare the rest of the squad.
“Sundai was definitely instrumental all 
four years of her being here in terms of just being able to completely mimic the other team,” Mann said. 
“We definitely are missing it, but there 
are other players that have stepped up, and 
we all do a role to kind of help each other 
get better when we’re scouting.”
It’s not like the Gators lost a Kelly Mur-
phy-type player who would be a point scor-
er every set of every match.
Weston played in 85 sets in her four 
years at UF. Six of the 11 returning Gators 
played more sets just last year than Weston did in her entire career. 
However, sophomore Simone Antwi said 
that the situational practices that Weston helped with last year and that Backlund and Dagostino are helping with this year are a major part of the Gators’ success when 
they perform during matches.
“Putting yourself in scenarios like that 
kind of helps you for game time,” Wise 
said. “I’ll refer back to a situation like, ‘Oh, I’m at practice and I’m serving against this 
and this person.’ I just feel like it helps me a 
lot, like relax me for the game.”
With Florida never having faced George-
town or Iona in program history and having 
only played Western Michigan once — in 
1999 –— the Gators’ week-long preparation 
for this weekend’s Active Ankle Challenge 
was especially important, Wise said.
“Most of their players, our players will 
see for the very first time,” she said. 
“The offenses that they run (and) their 
defenses, we are learning it through video, through gameplan and the adjustments that we make on the court.”volleybAll , from page 1316, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 13, 2013

us, for the Gators, really was, from what I saw, was a lot of 
turnovers. Turnovers. It’s hard to win games when you shoot 
yourself in the foot. And I have faith that they’ll clean it up. I 
think our defense is going to be really good. I’m hoping that 
we’ll have some big playmakers show up on offense for the 
Gators. That’s one area that, you know, I think our defense 
is really good, and I would like to see some big playmakers 
show up on offense here, and I think we’ll be just fine.”
