Student events
to benefit Haiti
0 CLUB CREOLE WILL
DONATE TO PROJECT HAITI.
By ELIZABETH BEHRMAN
Alligator Writer
For UF students, fundraising
for Haiti this weekend may be as
simple as eating pancakes, listen-
ing to music or attending a gala.
Angela Pierre, public relations
chairwoman for Club Creole,
said she hopes to raise more than
$5,000 dollars at the annual Club
Creole Gala Saturday night at the
Turkey Creek Golf & Country
Club in Alachua.
The night of Haitian cuisine,
music and art will benefit Project
Haiti.
Project Haiti is a group of
medical students and facultywho travel to Haiti each spring to
bring medical care and supplies
to the area.
"It's a really good col-
laborative effort to have
everyone get on board for
the cause."
Angela Pierre
public relations chairwoman for
Club Creole
"It will be educational," Pierre
said. "It will be cultural."
Pierre said Club Creole is part-
nering with the Tallahassee chap-
ter of the Haitian Cultural Club
and the Dominican Student Or-
ganization to produce the fund-
raiser.

Alligator Contributing Writer
He's been the Gainesville City

night Craig Lowe is taking another
step in his climb up the political
ladder.
The Craig Lowe for Mayor Cam-
paign is opening its official head-
quarters at 5 p.m., and Eric Conrad,
the communications director for the

connect the community to the brew-
ing mayoral race.
"The event will be a great op-
portunity to meet Craig," Conrad
said.
Lowe and Campaign Manager
Garrett Garner will help attendees
looking to get involved with thecampaign.
They will also discuss future
events and ways to participate in
the grassroots efforts to elect Lowe.
"We're thrilled to have had
enough support from the commu-
nity at such an early phase of the
campaign to be able to
Local provide a space for all
News of our dedicated vol-
unteers to work in,"
Lowe said in a press release.

City struggles to set start
date of Superfund cleanup
By JIMMIE PAUL
Alligator Writer
The Gainesville City Commission contin-
ues to debate the start date for the cleanup
efforts of the Koppers Inc. industrial site.
At Thursday's commission meeting, May-
or Pegeen Hanrahan urged the Environmen-
tal Protection Agency to work fast -locals
are pushing for a date, she said.
Residents within the site, which is located
northwest of Gainesville, have gotten ill be-
cause of the contaminated soil and drinking
water, according to the commission.
The city's main concern is ensuring the
health of the community, Commissioner Jack
Donovan said.
One of Donovan's most pressing questions
pertained to the soil regulations imposed by
the city and the potential presence of corrupt
data.
Hanrahan said the community will be in-volved in cleaning up the site.
She is optimistic the EPA will have a date
set by March 15. This, she said, gives the com-
mission enough time to hear and respond to
the concerns of the community.
"We're redeveloping the site for purpos-
es that are beneficial to the
'A Gainesville community,"
Hanrahan said.
Hanrahan also said resi-
dents and local business
owners near the site are
concerned about future
Hanrahan construction and property
value.
The cleanup standards for the site were
discussed with the new property owner,
Beazer East. However, the future use of the
site remains unclear.
"We want the cleanup as soon as pos-
sible," Hanrahan said, "but as thorough as
possible."

Counselor to help with 'healing'
By JOEY FLECHAS
Alligator Writer
As disaster relief efforts provide
food and shelter for those suffering
in Haiti, one UF professor wants
people to remember the emotional
impact of the earthquake.
Cirecie West-Olatunji, a pro-
fessor of counselor education, is
featured on the American Counsel-
ing Association's newest podcast,
"Stress and Haitian Americans.""This was one way in which
I could reach a lot of people," she
said.
She talks about how counsel-
ors can recognize when Haitian-
Americans affected
On by the disaster areCampus distressed and need
intervention.
"The effects of disaster will be
felt in many months ahead," she
said.
West-Olatunji said she advo-cates the use of community coun-
seling, which goes beyond helping
just the individual or the family
and focuses on healing the whole
community.
She noted this approach is well-
suited for helping the Haitian com-
munity because the idea of profes-
sional counseling is not prevalent
in their culture.
"It expedites the healing pro-
cess, and it's more organic," she
said.Radio announcer

Steve Babik, the former Gators broadcaster who is facing child
pornography charges, was released from police custody Tuesday
and remains under electronically monitored home detention.
Babik plead not guilty to one count of receipt and distribution
and one count of possession of child pornography, according to
the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern Dis-
trict of Florida.
Babik's activity was discovered on his home
computer during a monthlong investigation by
the Gainesville Police Department, the Alachua
County Sheriff's Office, the FBI and the North
Florida Internet Crimes Against Children Task
Force, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office.
Babik He's facing five- to 10-years imprisonment,
up to lifetime probation and a fine of $250,000
for the distribution charge. For possession, he faces a maximum of
10 years in prison, lifetime probation and another fine of $250,000,
according to the U.S. Attorney's Office.
Babik is scheduled to appear before a judge on March 1.* THE BANK SUPPLIES LOCAL HOSPITALS.

LifeSouth Community Blood Centers want people
to start their year off by saving three lives as part of
National Blood Donor Month.
Gary Kirkland, a spokesman for LifeSouth, said UF
and Santa Fe College students help supply more than
190 units needed weekly for the community.
"They're young. They're healthy. They're able todonate, and they do," Kirkland said.
Clay Gibbons, the center's district community de-
velopment coordinator, said January is the perfect time
to donate and replenish supplies because the week be-
tween Christmas and the new year is the slowest for
donations. He said more than 30 percent of people are
eligible to donate blood but less than 5 percent actually
do.
LifeSouth collects umbilical cord blood, stem cells,
bone marrow, plasma and platelets. They also supply
the major hospitals in the area, which use the blood to
treat trauma patients, cancer patients, burn victims and
patients with other diseases affecting the blood.

Local shop builds
pedal-free go-karts
By ANDREA RUMBAUGH
Alligator Contributing Writer
The thrill of racing only an inch
above the ground and the drive of
the competition lured GatorMoto
owner Justin Jackrel into go-kart
racing and building.
Now he's found a way for peo-
ple who are unable to use their legs
to experience the same rush.
GatorMoto, a Gainesville go-
kart manufacturer, began in early
January to commercially produce
a go-kart that uses hand controls
instead of pedals. It is hosting a
competition to give one of the
karts away.
The competition lasts until
April 30, and people can enter or
be nominated if they are at least 13
years old, Jackrel said.
He said contestants can apply
by submitting information about
their disability and about how
they have given back to the com-
munity.
"We're looking for someone
that's made a difference, that
hasn't taken the hand that they've
been dealt and have moped on the
couch for the past 20 years," Jack-
rel said.Before GatorMoto became the
nation's first company to com-
mercially produce the hands-only
karts, each kart had to be modi-
fied and cost between $4,000 and
$5,000. Now, customers can buy
one for $1,399 at GatorMoto, he
said.
The driver controls the kart's
gas and brake by pulling back on
handles attached to the steering
wheel, Jackrel said.
With these go-karts, people un-
able to use their legs can compete
in the same competitions as other
drivers, he said.
"People with
Around disabilities don'tGainesville want to race
in their own
league," Jackrel said. "They want
to be part of the 'normal people."'
Mike Clements, owner of Clem-
ents Enterprises and four-time In-
ternational Kart Federation Grand
National Champion, likes the new
go-kart.
He has seen many injured driv-
ers who were unable to continue
racing and likes that GatorMoto's
go-kart will help them race again.
Clements plans on entering his
brother's friend, Jeff Miller, into
the competition.Justin Jackrel poses for a photo next to a GatorMoto kart.

SPECIAL REPORT
UF grad students share Haiti experiences, try to adjust
ByCJ PRUNER
Alligator Writer
Since returning from Haiti last week,
Jon Bougher and Roman Safiullin have
been making their rounds on the media
circuit.
Bougher and Safiullin are UF graduate
film students who were shooting a docu-
mentary in Haiti when the earthquake hit.
Bougher arrived in the U.S. on Jan. 14,
and Safiullin came back Jan. 16.
NBC's "Today Show" interviewed
Bougher and Safiullin Jan. 17 and aired ex-
cerpts of the footage they captured in the
moments after the earthquake."Being on TV was nerve-wrecking, but
the set-up [on the 'Today Show'] was inti-
mate which I really liked," Bougher said.
The film students have also been fea-
tured on Fox News, MSNBC and inter-
viewed by local news stations.
Bougher said he was happy with the
news coverage, but admitted at times he
felt the media was using his story to fill
empty space on news programs.
"You feel bad because it cheats the mes-
sage," Bougher said. "You want to keep
the focus on the Haitian people."
Safiullin agreed, adding the tragedy in
Haiti couldn't be captured in a 50-second
segment.He said being in the spotlight can be
stressful and physically taxing but bears
no comparison to the struggles of the Hai-
tian people.
"You want to keep the focus on
the Haitian people."
Jon Bougher
UF graduate student
Yet Safiullin said it will take time for
him to adjust to everyday life.
He is trying to return to a normal
sleeping schedule, and his life still feels
rushed."I'm still trying to figure out what's
happening," he said.
In the meantime, Bougher and Safiullin
also need to decide what to do with their
documentary and the 40 minutes of foot-
age they shot during the aftermath of the
earthquake.
Bougher said he may return to Haiti in
about a month to continue filming, but he
will consult with Safiullin and those in-
volved with the project before deciding.
He said he doesn't want to to go to Haiti
while it's overrun with the media.
Bougher said the focus of the project
would likely change, possibly zeroing in
on the spirit of rebuilding.

E TCBY HAS ADDED 10

TCBY customers now have

The Create & Enjoy bar, a
self-serve toppings system, is
exclusive to The Gator Nation,
according to manager Travis
Clements.
The store, located at 1600 SW
Archer Road, began implement-
ing the bar at the start of the
semester to compete with com-
petitors such as Mochi.But unlike Mochi's full self-
serve system, TCBY customers
don't dispense their own yogurt.
Instead, it is served to them in
size-specific amounts before
they sprinkle on their own top-
pings.
"It's a hybrid-type system
that keeps customers from get-

Club Creole to hold gala for Haiti
By LEANDRA VALENTINE
Alligator Contributing Writer
When translated, Haiti's national motto says
"Unity makes strength."
And in the aftermath of last week's earth-
quake, uniting is exactly what UF students will
be doing at Club Creole's Spring Gala Satur-
day.
The formal-attire event, held at the Turkey
Creek Golf & Country Club at 6 p.m., will fea-
ture traditional Haitian kompa music, a catered
buffet and an art auction displaying original
Haitian works.
By paying the $30 admission, attendees
donate to Project Haiti, which establishes tem-
porary clinics and brings medical supplies to
adults and children.
According to the project's official Web site,
the team works on the border of the Dominican
Republic and Haiti, which volunteers refer to
as a win-win situation.
"There's a bit of irony about how gala has
correlated with the disaster," co-director Uri-
elle Renelus said.
Since last week's earthquake, ticket sales for
the gala have drastically increased.Club Creole, UF's Haitian Student Associa-
tion, chose this year to be "Journey on the Red
and Blue Carpet -Fulfill Your Destiny."
"We are trying to portray Haiti in a positive
light," gala co-director Raquel Saint-Hilaire
said. "This title expresses what we want people
to see.
"We are trying to portray Haiti in a

Scheduled to speak is Aaron Jackson, co-
founder of Planting Peace, a nonprofit group
that sends medical supplies to Haiti.
Jon Bougher and Roman Safiullin, two UF
students who were in Haiti during the earth-
quake, will also be attending, Renelus said.
A moment of silence to honor the lives that
were lost in the earthquake has been added to
the event's program.
"I hope people aren't too down," Renelus
said. "When tragedy happens, we pick up our
feet and move on."

We're not sure about you, but the Editorial Board is cer-
tainly glad to see it's almost the weekend. We're already
annoyed, pissed off and just plain exhausted. So why don't
we skip the formalities and go right to.
Darts & Laurels
Because no one reads the opening anyway.
Another story a vast majority of our readers always
seem to skip over usually involves everyone's favorite
boring governing body -UF's Student Government.
During Tuesday night's Student Senate meeting, sena-
tors unanimously passed a bill that will allow students to
vote on whether they support the Reitz Union expansion
fee during this spring's election.
So, for finally working together on something instead
of biting each others heads off, having 45 minute debate
sessions discussing if you should debate on an issue or
not, and crying about why SG just isn't fair, we're going
to throw a see-isn't-working-together-the-best LAUREL to
SG.
She may have looked like a cactus in an evening gown
on "The Oprah Winfrey Show," but we can't help but want
to pat her on the shoulder (very carefully though) when
she said she'll pledge all her proceeds from her Sunday
concert in New York to Haiti relief organizations.
On top of that, all the money she gets from merchandise
purchased on her Web site Jan. 24 will go directly to a Hai-
tian relief fund too.And that's why we're going to heave
a rah-rah-ah-ah-ahh-good-job-jobahaha LAUREL to Lady
Gaga (ohh la la).
Speaking of blonde celebrities, though Lady Gaga's
similarity to our next Dart recipient ends there, The Edito-
rial Board would like to stick a hypodermic needle DART
in Heidi Montag's forehead -don't worry, she can't feel
anything. Montag, who used to be a cute girl, now looks
like a wax version of Joan Rivers 40 years ago.
When an interviewer challenges you to move your face
and you can't, something is wrong. Seriously, though.
Who gets neck lipo? But even though she spent the GDP
of Croatia on surgery and married an asshole with a flesh-
colored beard, we want you to know we care.
So take this warning and stop now -before you look
like Donatella Versace.
And while we're on the subject of failure, the Editorial
Board, of course, would like to launch a we-don't-want-
to-hear-anyone-in-Massachusetts-complain-about-not-
being-able-to-pay-medical-bills DART at Massachusetts
voters for possibly ruining the country's chance at exten-
sive health care reform. Shame on you, Bay State, for not
considering the repercussions of handing Republicans an-
other Senate seat on a silver platter.
One family who hasn't been eating anything off a silver
platter is John Edwards' (second) family.
Edwards who has been denying being Frances Quinn
Hunter's dad for about two years now, finally came clean.
That's why we're going to chuck a we-always-thought-
you-looked-like-a-baby-daddy-so-it's-better-late-than-
never LAUREL to John Edwards, who may not have any
brains under that head of hair but will at least be able to
afford some nice Christmas presents.
Look on the bright side -you probably won't have to
pay for her braces.
That's it for now. Hopefully next time, we'll be in a bet-
ter mood. Until then, we're just going to take the wise ad-
vice from someone mentioned here today: Lady Gaga.
And that of course is -just dance. It'll be OK.

Q -~-A ~T@P~*
~t~L ~ 1 -
America should ri
0,364 vs. 210. Obviously, 30,364 is a much greater num-
ber than 210. Sadly, the former amount represents the
number of gun-related deaths, including homicides,
suicides and accidental deaths, in the United States in 2005.
According to a blog post from the New England Coalition
to Prevent Gun Violence, 210 is an extrapolated figure that
represents the number of gun-related deaths in the United
Kingdom if its population was equal to the United States. In
reality, there are only 42 gun-related deaths per year in the
U.K., according to the blog.
Without the violence from guns, the U.K. deals with in-
creased violence from knives. Many conservatives have
voiced concerns about the "Liberal agenda" to get rid of guns,
even ridiculing it, because it would only cause knife violence
to increase. As renowned as Britain's knife violence is, it is
still much less than the knife violence in our own country.
The FBI's data from 2004 shows that 1,866 people were
killed from knife attacks in the United States during that year.
Comparatively, knife violence in Britain at its highest rate
has resulted in 322 fatal stabbings, according to an article on
the Daily Mail Web site. Extrapolating the data shows if Brit-
ain had the same population as the U.S, 1,610 people would
be killed because of knife violence. Even without the use of
guns, Britain still manages to have less knife-related deaths
per year than the U.S. Some may say this points to America's
culture being more violent than Britain's, and eliminating
guns would only cause homicides to be committed through
other means. But mass killings would at least be mitigated.
It seems like we have mass killing sprees at least once per
week. And in fact, one occurred this past week. Christopher
Speight shot and killed eight people in Appomattox, Va. Peo-
ple close to him said he was an experienced gun enthusiast.
He had apparently been practicing daily in his backyard over
the past few months.We've become a nation obsessed with
guns. The Second Amendment is extremely vague and was
written in the wake of the Revolutionary War when colonists
had to take up their own arms to fight against a tyrannicald itself

government. The Founding Fathers
wanted to set up their government in
the wake of the struggle against Great
Britain so the people could form their
own militia.
While we have the right to form
our own militia under the Second
Amendment, in this day and age such
a militia poses no threat against our
government. A few handguns, rifles
and automatic weapons are nothing compared to the might
of the armed forces with their nuclear and biological weap-
ons. Therefore, there is no need for us to have guns under the
reasons given by the Founding Fathers.
Those who advocate treating the U.S. Constitution as a
document that should be taken literally commit the same
error as those who believe the same thing about the Bible.
Both the Constitution and the Bible were written by men and
are, therefore, flawed. It's important to remember the context
of everything that is in them. That is why we have added
and subtracted from the Constitution over the years. The
Founding Fathers weren't right on every account. I wonder
if people would demand we go back to the original wording
of Article 1, Section 2, Paragraph 3, of the original Constitu-
tion: the Three-Fifths Compromise, under which all African-
Americans were deemed only to be 60 percent human.
If we were to eliminate guns from the equation, we could
potentially cut the number of deaths in the U.S. by thousands.
If we emulated the British system with regard to weapon
use, we would be much better off and much safer. In order
to implement such a change, we would have to confiscate
all registered guns and find ways to regulate illegal ones.
We would have to thoroughly search everything coming in
and out of the country. It would be difficult, but it would be
worth it for the future safety of our country.

A W1EAKP.Letter to the Editor
Sex column misses mark
Editor's note: This letter was written in re-
sponse to Thursday's sex column. To read
the column, visit alligator.org/the avenue
Thank you, Dr. Dick Dilemma.
I believe there was only one pertinent thing
in the entire article (HARD OFF: When Penises
Flop). Yes, when drunk, especially when you're
with someone who you have little to no respect
or feelings for, a guy trying to get his penis up
confronts a difficult task. We already know this
though, so I don't see the need to beat a dead
horse. Although I'm sure your opinions apply
to many of the tramps around UF, I think ar-
ticles such as this one are as pointless as beating
a dead baby. Not everyone partakes in drunken
or casual sex, nor should articles like this one as-
sume so by spouting off about sensitive issues
like penis problems. For some people it takes ex-
perience to find out, and for others it is known
intrinsically. But sex is a much more beautiful
thing that should exist within a monogamous
relationship.
Something in the article was said about "un-
necessary psychological harm." I believe the
Guest column
Supreme Court decision has grim implications for Americans
Some people believe that Tuesday'sRepublican victory in Massachusetts,
which may have cut the throat of health
care reform, was big news. I beg to differ.
The big news came out of a large room hold-
ing nine small people and a few witnesses
on Thursday afternoon. It was doomsday
for the individual in American politics. The
Supreme Court decided on Thursday that
corporations and unions are no longer be-
holden to the rules that had limited their
spending on federal elections. Remember
that date. Because the gargantuan coffers of
those corporations and unions are now open
very, very wide, and the words "shall makeno law abridging the freedom of speech"
have led to some very murky consequences.
Justice John Paul Stevens read a long, lonely
dissent from the bench. He called the deci-
sion "a rejection of the common sense of
the American people, who have .fought
against the distinctive corrupting potential
of corporate electioneering since the time of
Theodore Roosevelt."
That's right. Those protections had been
around since 1907, when Standard Oil was
the biggest thing going. Things are a little
different now. We have TV, the Internet,
cars and multinational corporations whose
budget rolls make Standard Oil look likeJames Chapin Stan's Stop-N-Gas.
Speaking Out Sean Hannity will
crow. It's his job. As
will other aligned
media outlets: It seems like the Right won,
after all. But I honestly believe that it will
be tough for the most silver-tongued of ra-
diomen or slickest periodical to make too
many Americans read today's paper and
not be angry.
Liberal or conservative, it doesn't mat-
ter much. This is about something else. This
about some serious paradigmatic whiplash
for anyone who thought they knew how
politics is dealt, bought and sold in Amer-

that the Supreme Court Republicans over-
played their hands, noting that Microsoft's
Bill Gates and the people at Google -a
pretty rich, pretty liberal set of dudes -are
also players now. And ah, how the ol' tug-
of-war goes on. But it doesn't, necessarily.
There's a new game afoot, and whatever it
is, it sure won't look much like the old tug-
of-war.
No, this isn't about politics. It's about
a strange feeling that citizens with human
eyes, ears, brains and souls suddenly have
a little less say in human affairs.

only psychological harm we should be wor-
rying about is that which is inflicted on those
reading this filth. Some, don't forget, don't
even have random-sexual-partner penis issues
in their frames of reference. There is, of course,
an audience for this material. I just don't think
what should be an intellectual and sophisticated
atmosphere is the place for it.
If you were partaking in sexual relations with
someone you actually cared for, there would be
no issue because there are remedies that could
be prescribed with minimal embarrassment.
Lastly, I think there was something great go-
ing with this penis spectrum you were speak-
ing of. Maybe if all willing participants keep
sleeping around and fondling as many penises
as possible, a little documentary could be done
regarding the varying strengths of a boner. Be
sure to account for the confounding factors you
spoke of, like funny-looking boobs or flat asses.
To be honest, the more I think about it, maybe
your boobs do look funny.

Indiana prof. discusses effect of images on people
By KATIE FINNEY
Alligator Contributing Writer
To many Americans, iconic images
like the fall of the Berlin Wall symbolize
change in regime.
But according to Padraic Kenney, who
spoke to about 30 faculty members and
students in Dauer Hall Thursday, other
historical moments defined the fall of com-
munism greater than the fall of the Berlin
wall.
Kenney, a professor of history at Indi-
ana University, discussed how on Nov.
9, 1989, East Germans climbed onto and
crossed the Berlin Wall after an announce-ment by the government, and the event
was broadcast on western television sta-
tions.
The drama created the hype, Kenney
said.
"It's that feeling of making history," he
said. "It's a photogenic event, one that we
all know."
But a revolution that was years in the
making brought down communism, he
said, and Americans tend to ignore the
demonstrations that happened before No-
vember 1989.
"So many narratives of the fall of the
wall treat it as a miraculous event," he
said.

cans learned from 1989, it's that
visuals matter."
Padraic Kenney
professor of history at Indiana University
It's like sleeping through the game and
then waking up and realizing what hap-
pened, he explained.
"If there's one thing that Americans
learned from 1989, it's that visuals mat-
tive effort to have everyone get
on board for the cause," Pierre
said.
The Greek community is also
helping Haiti.
Kappa Alpha Theta Sorority
and Sigma Phi Epsilon Fraternity
are co-hosting a pancake brunch
at the Kappa Alpha Theta house
on Friday.
Clare Sullivan, vice president
of development for the sorority,
said guests can pay $5 at the door
and enjoy all-you-can-eat pan-
cakes from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.
"We were trying to think of
other ways to bring people to-
gether and get people to donate,"
Sullivan said.
All of the proceeds will go to
Gators United for Haiti, Sullivanter," Kenney said.
Kenney is the last speaker in the UF
Center for European Studies series, From
the Iron Curtain to the EU: 20 years after
1989.
Megan Kosinski, a UF art history soph-
omore, attended the speech as part of ex-
tra credit for her Women from the "Other"
Europe class and said that the discussion
was informative, especially in light of the
campus demonstrations during Novem-
ber, which recognized the fall of the Berlin
Wall.
"It's more of just seeing a different
viewpoint," Kosinski said.

Gators break even in SEC with road win
0 FLORIDA WILL HOST SOUTH CAROLINA
ON SATURDAY.
By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
aberry@alligator org
FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. -If you ask Kenny Boyn-
ton, Erving Walker wasn't just the best player on the
floor in the first half Thursday night.
"I think Erv was the first half," Boynton said. "I
don't feel like we could have asked for more from
Erv tonight. It was his night."
Walker finished with a career-high 27 points on
7-of-12 shooting as Florida (13-5, 2-2 Southeastern
Conference) held off Arkansas (8-10, 1-2 SEC) for a
71-66 win in Bud Walton Arena on Thursday night.
The 5-foot-8 sophomore guard drained threes in
the half-court offense, pulled up from beyond the arc
in transition and got into the lane, carrying the Gators
through the first half and coming up big when they
needed him to after halftime.
"I just took what the defense gave me," Walker
said. "Sometimes in transition they left me for open
looks or pressured me so much they let me penetrate,
so I just took what they gave me.'
Walker was the one bright spot in an otherwise-
ugly first half for both teams. There were eight ties
and four lead changes before intermission, but poor
shooting from the field was constant throughout.
The Razorbacks stayed in the game thanks to
sharpshooting guard Rotnei Clarke, who had 17
points and five three-pointers, forward Marshawn
Powell (14 points) and guard Courtney Fortson (14
points, 11 assists).
Walker's floater in the final seconds of the first
half gave UF a 28-26 lead, and the Gators came out of
the locker room firing, jumping out to an eight-point
lead. But Arkansas fought back and tied it up at 36
with 13:29 remaining.
The teams went back and forth from there, ex-
changing baskets until Florida went on a 9-0 run that
put the Gators ahead 64-56 with less than three min-

Stacked recruiting classes make transfers inevitable
very year the Gators bring in a recruitingclass filled with talented prospects, often
with many at the same position.
The players who aren't seeing playing time
early on usually end up transferring away
from Florida to somewhere they can show
their talent.
The Gators have not had any leave the pro-
gram this offseason quite yet, but some are
likely to come. This is usually about the time
that those decisions are made.
Just by taking a guess at what the depth
chart will look like next year, there are some
players that probably should transfer:
Freshman Offensive Lineman Kyle Koehne:
He came in with four other highly touted of-
fensive linemen, most of whom have already
received praise from Urban Meyer. With onlyBobby Callovi
Bobby's World
bcallovi@alligator orgone lineman leaving,
he is still going to be
stuck behind all of them.
With the big jam logs
at the guard and tackle
positions, he should
play center. The only
problem there is Mike
Pouncey is going to take
over for his brother,
Maurkice, at center, and
redshirt freshman Sam Robey seems to be the
center-in-waiting. That leaves Koehne as a ca-
reer backup.
Possible new school: Being from Indiana, he
should consider a return trip back home and
join the Hoosiers.
Redshirt Freshman Linebacker BrendanBeal: He came in as a one of the top recruits
but has not been able to make an impact on
the field due to injuries. Last year as he stood
on the sidelines watching while freshman Jon
Bostic was impressing the coaches. With the
Gators using more 3-4 defense next year, they
will need a second middle linebacker, but Beal
will still be behind Bostic on the depth chart
and probably shouldn't hang around much
longer.
Possible new school: He's another that might
want to return to his home state, Pennsylvania,
and attend Linebacker U.
Freshman Defensive End Kedric Johnson: Al-
though the Gators are losing their two starting
ends, they still have plenty on the roster and

Things couldn't have been
much worse for Alabama,
which was in the basement of
the Southeastern Conference,
heading into its game against
Florida on Thursday.
The Crimson Tide had zero
conference wins and lost their
leading scorer, Varisia Raffing-
ton, to injury Sunday.
But Tierney Jenkins picked
up the slack in the Tide's 82-
58 win. She finished with 28
points, 12 rebounds and five
steals to lead Alabama (9-10,
1-5 SEC) to its first conference
win.
It's the most points Florida
has allowed an individual
player to score this season.
"Alabama was just more
ready to play today," coach
Amanda Butler said. "Tierney
Jenkins kicked
our butts from
one end of the
court to the
other -first
half, second
half -played
like a big-time
Butler player.G
The Gators
(10-9, 3-3 SEC) looked nothing
like they did in their previous
three SEC games, playing poor
defense (allowed 58 percent
from the floor) and shooting
the ball terribly.
Florida shot 31 percent (22
of 70) and had an even more
dismal outing from beyond the
arc, going 4 of 18 (22 percent).
Alabama took advantage
of UF's mistakes with Jenkins
leading the charge. She had 17
of her team's 38 first-half points
and added seven rebounds in
the opening period.

Gators look for first road win
* UF LOST ITS ONLY OTHER
ROAD MEET THIS SEASON.
By TOM GREEN
Alligator Writer
After notching their first win
of the season last week, the Gators
are out to prove just how good
they can be.No. 4 Florida (1-1, 1-0 South-
eastern Conference) hits the road
to take on No. 12 Kentucky (3-1,
1-0 SEC) at Memorial Coliseum.
It's the Gators' first SEC road
meet, and they hope to come away
with their first road win of the sea-
son after opening the year with a
loss at Oklahoma.
"It's just another chance to go
out there and show everyone what
Maria Farias/ Alligator
Freshman Randy Stageberg looks to improve on her slow start. Her
best score this year was a 9.825 on vault against Arkansas.we're made of," freshman Randy
Stageberg said. "There's no one
out there who can touch us if we
do what we know we're capable of
doing."
The victory over Arkansas has
given UF confidence as it moves
forward with the season. But a vic-
tory on the road against Kentucky
will boost Florida's confidence
even more.
"We're excited for this to be
an away meet," senior Maranda
Smith said. "We want to prove to
ourselves we can get a high team
score in an away situation, and not
just at home."
In their second meet, the Gators
improved their scores on the un-
even bars, balance beam, floor ex-
ercises and total team score.
The team has continued to
work on the minor details to con-
tinue improving, like sticking
landings, jumps on floor routines,
handstands on bars and all-around
performance.
"We've proven that we have
the skills," Smith said. "Now we
just need to put those tiny details
in to get those 9.95s instead of a 9.9
or 9.85."
Last week, the Gators had some
mistakes in the middle of their
lineups, and coach Rhonda Faehn
hopes the team can eliminate those
errors.
The Gators know they are go-
ing to have to come into Kentucky
comfortable and confident.
The team will have to adjust
to the water-weighted bars that
Kentucky, and most other schools,
use. The bars aren't drilled into the
ground and are bouncier.
Faehn said the team is famil-
iar with the bars and it shouldn't
make a difference.
"They know how to adjust,
we're just making sure they're pre-
pared mentally," Faehn said.
For the Gators, that mental
preparation combined with the
physical work on details they have
gone through this week has added
to their confidence.FRIDAY, JANUARY 22, 2010 U ALLIGATOR, 15
UF lands former
Tennessee commit
By JAIME MANHEIMER
Alligator Writer
Lane Kiffin's departure from Tennessee to USC certainly
doesn't hurt UF's recruiting class, but the Gators didn't re-
ally need the help.
Before Kiffin's announcement, Florida had already
snatched up four-star inside linebacker Michael Taylor de-
spite the uncertainty surrounding coach Urban Meyer's fu-
ture.
The 6-foot-1, 205-pounder from Atlanta Westlake High
(Ga.) changed his commitment from the Volunteers to the
Gators during his official visit to Gainesville on Jan. 8.
"He was very committed to Tennessee for a very long pe-
riod of time," Westlake High coach Greg Minnis said. "He
changed his mind kind of right before coach Kiffin really
decided to do what he wanted to do. He didn't really know
what was going on and didn't feel comfortable starting his
career there."
Taylor's commitment comes at a perfect time for the 2010
recruiting class, which is ranked No. 1 in
the nation by Rivals.com. The Gators just
locked up the top recruit of 2010 class,
Moreno Valley (Calif.) Rancho Verde
High defensive end Ronald Powell who
committed during the U.S. Army All-
American game.
Taylor joins five-star recruits defensive
tackle Sharrif Floyd (Philadelphia George
Washington high (Pa.)), defensive tackle
Dominique Easley (Staten Island (N.Y.) Curtis High) and
safety Matt Elam (West Palm Beach Dwyer High) in UF's
top-ranked recruiting class.
"Those guys developed a bond," Minnis said of all the
UF commits who played with Taylor at the U.S. Army All-
American Bowl. "After a month of playing with each other,
they really enjoyed their experience and wanted to carry on
that experience at Florida."
At 6-foot-1, Taylor is considered undersized for his po-
sition. But what he lacks in size Taylor makes up for with
intelligence.
"The main thing he needs to work on now may not have
to do with his size, but it's getting off the big guards and
tackles and shedding blocks," Minnis said. "But that's where
he uses his intelligence because he knows plays, he knows
gaps and knows proper fits."
With National Signing Day less than two weeks away,
Taylor's commitment solidifies UF's position as the nation's
top recruiting class.
Verbal commitments are non-binding until a letter of intent is
signed on or after singing day, Feb. 3.

UF takes advantage of Washington's early foul trouble
HOOPS, from page 14
utes remaining.
"We played a good game, but I feel like
we should have blown that game open early
and it shouldn't have even been that close,"
Walker said. "But it got like that, and we did
what we had to do."
The Razorbacks pulled to within four with
19 seconds left, but Walker hit two clutch free
throws to push the lead to six and put the
game out of reach.
UF made just two of its first 13 field-goal
attempts and finished the first half shooting
28.6 percent from the field. But the Gators
kept it close thanks to Walker, who scored
15 first-half points on 4-of-4 shooting fromthe field, including three three-pointers, and
made all four of his free-throw attempts.
Arkansas didn't fare much better from the
field before halftime, shooting just 10 of 27
and going most of the first
half without center Mike
Washington, who picked
up two early fouls and got
his fourth foul nearly half-
way through the second
half.
With Washington out,
Walker UF gained an early ad-vantage on the boards,
outrebounding Arkansas 21-16 in the first
half. Power forward Alex Tyus grabbed six
first-half rebounds, and forward Chandler
Parsons added five.Florida finished with 42 rebounds to Ar-
kansas' 29, an impressive performance for a
team that has struggled to crash the boards
all season, especially the offensive glass. The
Gators grabbed 17 offensive rebounds Thurs-
day night, more than tripling the Razorbacks'
total (5).
Tyus led the team with 12 boards and
added 11 points, good for his eighth career
double-double.
"We just really wanted to get after it,"
Tyus said. "We always focus on it, but it re-
ally worked out for us today."
UF will look to build on its two-game win-
ning streak back in Gainesville on Saturday
with a 6 p.m. matchup against South Caro-
lina. The Gators will only have one day to
prepare for the Gamecocks (11-7, 2-2 SEC).
Gators' turnovers, poor defense make 'Tide's upset possible
WHOOPS, from page 14
Florida turnovers resulted in six Alabama points.
The Crimson Tide capitalized by scoring 12 points off Florida's 10
turnovers in the first half. The Gators couldn't turn defense into of-
fense, managing five points off the Tide's nine first-half turnovers.
UF finished with 24 turnovers.
"The majority of the things that happened were our fault," Shari-
elle Smith said. "Between turnovers, just silly turnovers that we
shouldn't have had, and rebounding -we weren't rebounding like
we usually do, it was definitely self-inflicted."
The Gators' defensive effort lagged in the first half when the Tide
shot 52 percent from the field and outrebounded UF 21-16.
In the second half, the Gators still couldn't find the basket and
continued to turn the ball over, while Alabama turned a 12-point
halftime lead into a 24-point triumph.Between the 7:08 mark in the first half, when Alabama led 22-20,
and 12:04 in the second half, Florida was outscored 28-10.
The Tide's hot shooting -65 percent in the second half -kept
burning UF and quelled any comeback attempts.
Ericka Russell (18 points) and Celiscia Farmer
(19) were the other focal points for Alabama's of-
fense. No Gator finished in double digits, while
Smith and Stewart finished with nine each.
Women's The Gators return home Sunday to host South
Basket ball Carolina (10-8, 3-3) in the O'Connell Center at 1
p.m. It'll be a bittersweet moment for Jordan Jones,
who transferred from USC after her freshman year
and was the team's leading scorer.
"Alabama just brought it tonight and Florida did not," Butler
said. "We gotta bounce back. South Carolina is maybe playing the
best of anyone in our league right now."

have the nation's best defensive
end recruit committed to play next
year. It does not appear he will get
much of a chance to make a name
for himself at UF, and just like the
others, Johnson should bolt early
before he has used up too much of
his eligibility.
Possible new school: I don't have
a good choice for him, but Johnson
should re-open his recruitment and
look for a school that will give him
a better chance to play.
Redshirt Freshman Cornerbacks
Jeremy Brown and Adrian Bush-
ell: Only one of them needs to
leave, but this decision should wait
until after spring practice. Janoris
Jenkins has one of the starting jobs
wrapped up, but it will be an open
competition at the other spot. Who-
ever comes out of spring behind
should bolt. Florida is expected to
bring in a bunch of defensive backs
in this recruiting class, which will
only make things harder on them
to find a role on the team.
Possible new school: Bushell is
from Texas, so a switch to a Big 12
school would make sense. Brown
falls into the re-open recruitment
category and could go anywhere he
wants.
