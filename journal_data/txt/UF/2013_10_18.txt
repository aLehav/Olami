Although the weather is starting to cool down, UF stu-
dents are staying hot.
UF was ranked No. 13 in The Daily Beast’s 20 sexiest 
colleges in the nation for 2013, behind University of Miami 
and Miami University, and ahead of Florida State Univer-sity.
The rankings were based off of data from College 
Prowler, which ranked universities by the attractiveness of its men and women, as well as Trojan’s annual sexual health report card for universities across the country. Each of the three factors was weighed equally.
College Prowler rated men and women on the hotness 
scale by the following characteristics: attractiveness, athleti-cism, creativity, friendliness, fun, geeky, hardworking, into partying, outgoing, smart and stuck-up. The social scene on campus as well as the ratio of males to females was also taken into account.
UF’s men weighed in at 8.72 out 10, standing behind its 
women who ranked 9.03. Trojan ranked the university No. 12 for sexual health, based on accessibility of sexual health resources and information available to students. 
Shelby Weber, a 20-year-old UF health science junior, 
said she feels UF’s rank has a lot to do with Greek life bring-ing in a lot of attractive people to campus.

Buyers, beware: Used furniture 
is now more likely to be harboring 
tiny pests.
A recent poll by the National Pest 
Management Association shows calls to exterminators about bed-bugs have increased by 57 percent in the last ﬁ  ve years, according to a podcast recently released by UF Health Communications. 
However, the problem has not 
reached UF dorms.
“It has been about 10 to 15 years 
since bedbugs have been increasing, and they have not stopped increas-ing yet,” said Roberto Pereira, an associate research scientist for the UF entomology and nematology de-partment.Joey Muccio, a 21-year-old 
Gainesville resident, ran into a bed-bug problem while interning at a camp during the summer, and it still haunts him.“Once you get them, they get in 
your head and plague you,” Muccio said. “Every time I wake up with a bump, I immediately think I have bedbugs.”
Because UF has a Green Shield 
Certiﬁ  ed Integrated Pest Manage-ment program, exterminators in residence halls or family housing use Styrofoam heat boxes to control bedbugs, said Wayne Walker, the senior pest control technician for the UF department of housing.
Walker and his team follows 
bedbug protocol for each of the 10 to 15 cases received a year, even if they don’t suspect bedbugs to be the problem’s origin.
“Sometimes, it’s psychological 
and just the simple fact of doing something solves the issue,” Walker said.

Twerk, or treat? Miley Cyrus costumes are 
now Halloween-ready online.
A skin-tight leotard featuring the teddy bear Miley wore during the recent MTV Video 
Music Awards performance and a black-and-white, striped suit resembling Robin Thicke’s from his VMA performance is also for sale on  spirithalloween.com for $39.99 each.
A slightly different version of Miley’s get-
up, known as “Furry Party Animal Romper,” is also available for $79.95 on yandy.com.
“It’s not very tasteful,” said UF marketing 
junior Chelsea Moran, 20. “I wouldn’t wear it unless I lost a bet.”
Miley isn’t the only skimpy-celebrity suit 
on sale this Halloween. Costumes resembling the real-life ensembles of Lady Gaga and Nicki Minaj are also available at Simply Halloween in Butler Plaza and the Halloween Superstore in the Oaks Mall.
However, the two stores don’t carry the 
Miley costume. Simply Halloween employee Nicole Gomez, 19, said people are asking about it, though. 
Nineteen-year-old Kristi McDonough, also 
an employee, said she would wear the costume despite the questionable image it promotes.

Male and female runners

UF’s Sigma Chi fraternity host-
ed a ﬁ  tness carnival Thursday at 
P.K. Yonge to promote exercise and healthy living.
The carnival, the ﬁ  rst of its kind, 
included waterslides and ﬁ  eld games for the after-school pro-gram, while also informing chil-dren about healthy food choices.  
Greg Dana, the community ser-
vice organizer for Sigma Chi, said a brother certiﬁ  ed in nutrition told children what and what not to eat at an interactive station at the car-nival.
“We drink so much soda now 
and eat so much fast food now that it’s a rising issue in the United States, and we’re trying to tackle it at its roots,” the 20-year-old UF economics sophomore said.
Sigma Chi wants to do the car-nival every semester at different elementary schools, preferably ones that are from different so-cioeconomic backgrounds, Dana said.
“We already have seeds plant-
ed for other schools in the com-ing semesters,” Dana said. “The goal is to do well here and go out and educate the whole youth in Gainesville.”Robert Cox, the director of the 
Blue Wave After School Inc. pro-gram at P.K. Yonge, said he hopes the children had a good time while learning about their health.
“I think it’s important for some 
solid young people to be around some other young people and be positive inﬂ  uences,” Cox said. “If they can learn something along the way, that’s great.”

UF students’ theories: Greek life, intelligence, sun-kissed skin
“UF gets this reputation of being 
a ‘smart-people college,’” she said. “Honestly, when you walk around campus there are a lot of pretty people, which is nice.”
However, Netanya Wynn, a 21-
year-old UF public relations senior and PR director for the Faces Mod-eling Troupe, said it’s UF students’ intelligence that makes them attrac-tive.
“It’s a psychological thing where 
the people who are sexy are also the people who are smarter,” she said. 
On the list, University of Wis-consin reached the climax as the sexiest college in the nation, earn-ing a score of 9.32 and 9.12 for their men and women, respectively.
Tyler Ericson, a 19-year-old UF 
applied physiology and kinesiology sophomore, said because Florida’s students are always in the sunshine they show more skin.
“When it’s always summer time, 
you care about your body more,” he said.

The university’s emergency depart-
ment has broken away from the De-
partment of Environmental Health and Safety and become the Department of Emergency Management.
The new department will be housed 
with the Division of Public Safety, said Linda Stump, UF chief of police and as-sistant vice president of public and en-vironmental safety. She said establish-ing emergency management as its own department is in step with the growth of emergency management across the country.
Kenneth Allen, emergency manager 
for the new department, said other uni-versities and colleges have emergency management growing on their cam-puses.
Allen said his role will be to coor-dinate the emergency management program, which includes focusing on issues and continuing initiatives.
Now that emergency management 
is identiﬁ  ed as its own department, he said it can bring more attention to safe-ty on campus.
“Our goal is always to focus on pre-
paredness and university response,” he said.
Stump said the department will be 
able to give students all kinds of up-dates, including UFAlerts and weather updates. 
“We want people to recognize Emer-
gency Management as a resource,” she said.
Funding for the department hasn’t 
changed, Stump said. 
She said a goal of emergency man-
agement is to continue outreach, to pre-pare for an active shooter and prepare buildings for an emergency.
“People will see more proactive, 
educational initiatives to make sure the community is informed,” she said.UF emergency management

Prepare to be swamped with 
more Gator gear.
Butler Enterprises announced 
this week that Alumni Hall, an 
athletic store franchise, will be join-ing Butler Plaza at 3730 SW Archer Road. It will be in the spot formerly occupied by The Floor Trader. “We’ve been wanting to get into 
Gainesville for a long time now,” said Jeff Goodfriend, president of the chain. “My mission was to open a collegiate store that did things a little differently.”
That mission evolved into cre-
ating a destination for all Florida Gators paraphernalia. 
“If we don’t have it, we’ll get it 
for you,” Goodfriend said. The store will be 4,400 square 
feet, which is larger than the typical Alumni Hall store, he said. It will of-fer a 10 percent student discount.
David Lopez, a 19-year-old UF 
political science and economics sophomore who works at UF RecS-ports, said he didn’t think there are too many Gator stores in town.
“I think there should be more so 
the price goes down,” he said.
Lopez said he thinks students 
will go in looking for a speciﬁ  c item, whereas alumni who come to town for gamedays will go to the store because it advertises good customer service.“Alumni are not really price-
conscious when it comes to Gator stuff,” he said. “I think they do look for a better environment and better customer service.”
Goodfriend said he thinks 
Gainesville residents will like what Alumni Hall has to offer.
“I believe that we can bring some-
thing to Gainesville that they’ve never seen,” he said.

The government reopened yesterday, but don’t call it 
a comeback. According to the Washington Post, “The bill passed late Wednesday ended a stalemate created last month, when hard-line conservatives pushed Republican leaders to use the threat of shutdown to block a landmark expansion of federally funded health coverage.”
Congratulations, Republicans: You accomplished abso-
lutely nothing — that is, other than the furlough of federal workers and a shutdown that cost the U.S. as much as NASA’s budget. Thank God the panda cam is back on, at least. The biggest DART of all time to the GOP for bending to the will 
of party extremists, damaging the economy and diminishing the U.S.’s credibility abroad.
You’ll be happy to know that in some corners of the world  
people are ﬁ  ghting for a common cause and refusing to be-come mired in political nonsense. This week, we give a LAU-
REL to the Green Sisters, a group of Roman-Catholic nuns 
from a variety of orders who are as well-versed in the Gospels of Luke and John as they are in solar and geothermal technol-ogy.
According to The Atlantic: “‘The Judeo-Christian tradition 
is so beautiful, and it has such wisdom, but it doesn’t have a lot to say about fracking,’ Miriam MacGillis, a Dominican sister in her mid-seventies, said.”
This week, a workplace-harassment case received national 
attention when a woman in New York ﬁ  led a lawsuit against the company she formerly interned for. The judge presiding over her case said that, because she wasn’t receiving compen-sation, she had no right to sue because she wasn’t technically an employee.
While some are criticizing the judge, professors at UF told 
the Alligator this week that the judge’s decision wasn’t whol-ly invalid.
“I don’t think it’s surprising given the statute and the 
legislation,” Robert Emerson, a professor in the UF business school, said. “A lot of judges are reluctant to craft remedies or rights that go beyond the literal wording of a statute or regulation. They feel like that’s not their role.”
Given the importance of unpaid internships for gaining 
real-life skills and establishing industry connections and pro-fessional relationships, there’s a clear need for better legisla-tion regarding sexual-harassment suits. This week, we DART 
state Human Rights Laws for failing to extend protection to unpaid interns.
Our last LAUREL goes to the Kitten Cam at Petopia for

Happy Friday!‘Captain Phillips’ paints incomplete story
As an avid movie enthusiast, I seized the oppor-
tunity last weekend to watch “Captain Phillips,” the two-hour account of the 2009 hijacking of 
the USS Maersk Alabama by Somali Pirates.
I dare not make the audacious claim my money was 
wasted. On the contrary, “Captain Phillips” is a spec-tacular movie. Bolstered by memorable performances from Tom Hanks and Barkhad Abdi, “Captain Phillips” doesn’t fail to entertain the viewer. 
However, after one particular scene where a number 
of the pirates are murdered, a member of the audience barked a witless “Yes!” at the screen.
The viewer’s cheer struck me as a reﬂ  ection of the 
movie’s biggest failure: “Captain Phillips” neglects the context in which the Somali pirates take up arms. 
Thus, the audience is left with an incomplete story, 
where a malicious band of maritime criminals attack an innocent Bostonian Captain and his crew. 
Opponents will be brisk in pointing out the movie 
is supposed to be strictly based upon the narrative of Richard Phillips, a narrative that according to CNN has been contested by members of the ship’s crew.
What these individuals don’t want viewers to know 
is the truth about Somali pirates, a truth that brieﬂ  y sur-faces in an exchange between the captain and the leader of the pirates. 
In an attempt to understand his captors, Phillips asks 
them if there’s something that deﬁ  nes them other than being ﬁ  shermen or kidnapping people. 
The leader replies coldly, “maybe in America.”The leader, Muse, is expressing a sense of despair 
over the destruction of his livelihood. 
This is an issue that often goes unnoticed, as the West 
has been destroying the livelihood of Somali ﬁ  shermen for years.
In a Hufﬁ  ngton Post article, Somali-Canadian activ-
ist named K’naan illustrated how European companies are said to have paid warlords in Somalia for their approval of dumping toxic waste in the wa-ter, a $3-per-ton expense that would be unthinkably low in Europe. 
The article also highlights 
the diverse and grotesque com-pilation of waste being dumped 
— including lead, uranium and mercury.
According to Slate, European companies aren’t the 
only perpetrators of this environmental crime as reports have surfaced of the Italian maﬁ  a also using the waters as their dumping grounds. 
When these ships, legal or illegal, ﬁ  ll Somali waters 
with their waste it destroys the livelihood of those ﬁ  sh-ermen who rely on the Indian Ocean to survive.
So why have these companies and organizations cho-
sen Somalia? 
Somalia is ideal simply because there was no author-
ity before the pirates emerged. 
According to BBC, there has not been a stable cen-
tralized government in Somalia since 1991.
The land has been disputed between warlords and 
Islamic militants, creating an environment ripe for il-legal business. 
However, “Captain Phillips” fails to capture this 
larger picture. 
Instead it depicts drug-chewing pirates — the plant 
is called Khat, and coincidentally kills off the users’ ap-petite — whose only goal is to get as much money as they can from an unarmed ship.
Hopefully, if Hanks or Abdi should receive an Os-
car, they should be graceful enough to recognize the full context of the story in which they’ve played a role.

Unless one was really 
up on tech news, you might not rec-
ognize the name Hiroshi Yamauchi on first reference. But most would instantly recognize his work.
Yamauchi was the former presi-
dent of Nintendo Co., responsible for turning a trading card company into the electronics juggernaut we all know today. He was known for being heavy-handed by personally select-ing which games would be published and which wouldn’t, but it ultimately worked to the benefit of Nintendo. His sticking point was to not only make the best console at the best price, but one that was easy to program. 
Even after stepping down from the 
board of directors in 2002, he still had an active role in Nintendo. His last contribution may be in your pocket — the Nintendo DS. This was based on his idea when he asked his engineers, “What if we had two screens?” While Shigeru Miyamoto and Gunpei Yokoi deserve credit for the great games and the predecessor to the DS, the herald-ed Game Boy, it was Yamauchi who  built the company they would create for. One of the best visual examples to see what he has done with Ninten-do is on the walls of Game Hounds Video Games and Gifts, located in Manhattan, Kan. In the store, you can find a stand for Sony and a stand for Microsoft. However, the walls are all Nintendo until you get to the current console games section.
Rusty Schroll, the owner, said the 
walls are decorated that way because of the high quality of games Nintendo keeps putting out  — the standard Ya-mauchi insisted upon.
“I think Nintendo has some of 
the most iconic characters in games,” Schroll said. “Names that non-players would recognize. The original Nin-tendo was so important in the history of those franchises as it was the con-sole that launched most of the popu-lar franchises that are still relevant today.”
As Game Hounds sells used 
games, Nintendo products are one of their mainstays.
“Anything Nintendo puts out is 
golden, high quality,” Schroll said. “We normally recommend it for families, more casual gamers and for gamers just starting out. A nice thing about some of those older 2-D games and the new HD televisions is that they still look good on them. If you put most of the 3-D games onto one of those flat screens the blocky figures become huge.”To almost emphasize his 
point, the television in the store ran a commercial for the old game “Vagrant Sto-ry.” While being informed, it was a great game by the 
commercial for its PlayStation Vita release, you could plainly see what Schroll was referring to. However, Nintendo’s greatness may go beyond quality of graphics.
“Nintendo games have bang for 
your buck,” said Terry Standridge, Manhattan resident. “Today, games are six to eight hours long. Some Nintendo games will take you days to weeks of playing to beat. You can have days of use from them, and they also have replay value. I beat all three ‘Gears of War’ in a day.”
And that was not the only differ-
ence Nintendo has had over other consoles.
“My mother hated the PlaySta-
tion, but she would play Mario on the N64,” Standridge said. “Nintendo is iconic and family-oriented. The whole family can play Mario together rather than you hacking zombies by yourself.”
That sentiment was echoed by an-
other, even though he doesn’t play Nintendo anymore.
“Nintendo to me means nostal-
gia,” Johnny Wilson, graduate student in grain science, said. “I grew up on the N64. After that the graphics wars started and Nintendo became largely irrelevant since it doesn’t compete in that area.”
When the industry started it was 
mostly just Atari. Then, Nintendo took over in the ’80s, and Sega start-ed to produce consoles and games as well. Sony and Microsoft came into the picture in the ’90s and Sega became software only. It’s called the Console Wars because the market is controlled by Nintendo, Sony and Microsoft, the three that still make the hardware for their own software. All three compete for the best graphics, lowest prices and most sales.
“Most of the games I played back 
then were just the big multiplayer games,” Wilson said. “There was something magic about four people gathered around a television. I think it was physically being there with your friends. It was being able to punch them in the shoulder for being a jerk in game, rather than yelling ho-mophobic slurs through a headset to random people you don’t know.”

Nintendo president’s legacyUWireLetter to the Editor
Minimum wage should be abolished
In response to the Alligator’s editorial 
“Get your own fries with that” on Oct. 17:
In typical pseudo-progressive fashion, 
we see in this editorial more theory and 
no proof that a national minimum wage law results in a higher national standard of living. 
To the contrary, it ignores how the most 
stable European countries have NO na-tional minimum wage, while neighboring countries that do have the most unstable societies.  
The following have NO minimum wage 
laws: Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, Denmark and now Italy (after learning their lesson).  
Their living standards and their gov-
ernment fiscal soundness is far more sta-ble than countries with a minimum wage: Greece, Spain, France and (until recently) Italy.  
Yes, the nations with no minimum 
wage have labor unions for some skills, but so do we. 
The fact is, some people there work for 
about $1 per hour doing unskilled labor, and they are citizens! 
Why? Because those countries smartly 
decided it is far better to work for any wage to pay for universal health care, than to sit idle on welfare soaking up middle class taxpayer sweat.
Just like we see here, in parts of Europe 
a national minimum wage law causes so-cial decline on a general scale, starting with more high school dropouts, more gang and illegal drug culture, more under-ground labor and human trafficking, more illegal immigration — since citizens won’t work when welfare is handed to them in-stead.
It is insane to encourage more high 
school dropouts, which is what a $15 per hour wage would do. 
So what if today’s workers also get wel-
fare? Isn’t that what they pay taxes for, a safety net, too? And who says fast food workers must be the sole bread earners in a household? Today, like in most of the world, there are two or more wage earn-ers per household; it’s what has distorted the shrinking middle class numbers since women entered the workforce in droves 40 years ago.  
But fact is, in human history there’s 
always been more than one worker in a family farm or family business: the father, the mother, the grandparents and even the kids all worked in the family trade to keep a roof.
Sincerely,
J.D. Knee

� UF ADMINISTRATION AGREED 
TO MEET NEXT WEEK. 
VALERIE CRUM
Alligator Contributing Writer
UF administration agreed to meet 
with a group of students next week fol-
lowing a rally they held for opportunity outside Tigert Hall on Thursday.  
The local Students for a Democratic 
Society organization partnered with oth-er campus groups to ask UF to consider granting undocumented in-state stu-dents in-state tuition regardless of their immigration status.
“Undocumented students are told in 
high school that they can work hard and earn their way up, but that hope is shut down as soon as they graduate,” said Chrisley Carpio, 21, a UF history senior and lead SDS organizer for the event.  
Regardless of how long they lived 
in Florida, undocumented students are charged either international or out-of-state tuition fees to attend UF.This past summer, Florida Interna-
tional University passed a tuition equity policy that will provide in-state tuition for students under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which helps undocumented immigrants who came to the country as children.
“We are the ﬂ  agship school in Florida, 
but we are falling behind,” Carpio said. 
She organized the event to encour-
age the UF Board of Trustees to consider passing a similar policy at an upcoming meeting in December.
“Historically, this has happened over 
and over again,” said Farah Khan, a UF English and sociology sophomore. “One group of people is taking education away from others.”
Khan is the vice president of exter-
nal affairs for UF’s Students for Justice in Palestine. The group participated in the rally along with student members of CHISPAS and La Casita.
“Undocumented students are being 
kept in their place with the limited job opportunities that come from having no higher education,” Khan said.UF, SDS to discuss tuition

Gainesville: No. 1 in our hearts and No. 34 
in the best place to live in the country.
The city of Gainesville just clinched a spot 
on Livability.com’s Top 100 Best Places to Live 
list.
The list, which was released Tuesday, was 
narrowed down from 700 small- to mid-sized cities across the country.
“The ranking is purely data driven,” said 
Matt Carmichael, the 39-year-old vice presi-dent and editor of the website.
Each city was ranked on criteria including 
demographics, economy, education, health care and housing.
The scores were added up and compared to 
determine the ﬁ  nal ranking.  
Palo Alto, Calif., topped the chart in ﬁ  rst 
place; Boulder, Colo., took No. 2, and Berkeley, Calif., took third.
Beside Gainesville, seven other Florida cit-
ies also placed, including Miami Beach in ﬁ  fth place, Tampa in 19th and Tallahassee in 42nd.
Although this is the ﬁ  rst national-ranking 
list the website has produced, it will be recreat-ed and updated once a year, Carmichael said.
“It’s inaugural but an annual list,” Carmi-
chael said.Andy Fasig, the 42-year-old manager at 
Chain Reaction Bike Shop, arrived in Gainesville in ’91 as a UF student. 
He said he wasn’t surprised by Gainesville’s 
high ranking.
“It’s great because Gainesville has the small-
town appeal without the small-town thinking,” he said. “You get the best of both worlds.”
Fasig said he especially likes the centralized 
feel of Gainesville and deemed it “the best bike community in Florida.”
Rebecca Atkins, 21, is a UF wildlife ecology 
and conservation senior and was happy to hear Gainesville ranked so high.
Even as a Tallahassee native, Atkins said 
she favors her current city, which has been her home for the past four years.    
“I’ve never had a bad experience in 
Gainesville,” she said.
While No. 34 is a strong placement, Fasig 
still thinks Gainesville can do better.
“I’d like to see us in the top 20,” he said. 
“This is as good as it gets in the southeast Unit-ed States.”Gainesville 34th best place to liveLIFESTYLE

Florida goes on the road 
to face two Southeastern Conference opponents.  
Read the story online at alligatorSports.org.Captains announced
Will Muschamp announced via Twitter  that Jarrad Davis, Dante Fowler Jr., Jon Halapio and Jon Harrison would be Florida’s captains against Missouri on SaturdayADAM LICHTENSTEIN
Alligator Staff Writer @alichtenstein24
LSU gouged Florida for 175 
yards on the ground on Satur-
day in Baton Rouge, La. 
The schedule does not get 
any easier for the No. 22 Gators (4-2, 3-1 Southeastern Confer-ence) this week.
Florida will travel to Colum-
bia, Mo., on Saturday to face No. 14 Missouri (6-0, 2-0 SEC) in Faurot Field. When the Gators get there, they will square off against the No. 16 run offense in the country.
The Tigers, coming off a 41-26 upset win on the road against then-No. 7 Georgia, feature three halfbacks who are averag-ing more than 5 yards per carry.
Redshirt juniors Henry Josey, 
Marcus Murphy and sophomore Russell Hansbrough have com-bined for 1,099 yards through six games.“They got three outstand-
ing backs that are all guys that make you pay if you miss a play in space,” coach Will Muschamp said on the SEC weekly media teleconference on Wednesday.
Added linebacker Michael 
Taylor: “I expect us to stop the run against them.”
That will not be an easy task, 
but Taylor has a plan in mind.
“Hit the person with the ball 
and get them on the ground,” he said. “That’s it.”
Florida’s run defense has 
been ailing since losing senior Dominique Easley to a torn ACL. But now the defense might be down another starter.
Redshirt junior Ronald Pow-
ell suffered an ankle injury against LSU on Saturday and had not practiced as of Wednes-day. 
“We’re hoping to get him on 
the ﬁ  eld [Wednesday] and see how he moves around there,” Muschamp said.
Florida’s rush defense is still 
ranked fourth in the nation, but it has had its two worst games the last two weeks, surrender-ing 175 yards to LSU and 111 to Arkansas on Oct. 5.

ligatorSports.org.So, we here at the alligatorSports 
Brand Picks Column heard that the government was back in business and that they celebrated by raising the debt ceiling. Hooray!
Harry Reid was decked out in tri-
ple party hats. John Boehner played some Beethoven on a kazoo. Everyone played “Pin the tail on the Democrat” — Get it? Because donkey! — but no-body could get over all the elephants in the room — Get it? Republicans!
We like to celebrate by raising the 
roof and raising the stakes — hello, Missouri!
We’re sending our very own sports 
editor Phillip Heilman to Florida’s northernmost game since the Gators played Syracuse in the Carrier Dome in 1991. Also, a little thing called the Southeastern Conference Eastern Divi-sion is sort of on the line, so grab your popcorn!
It’s going to be a wild party in Co-
lumbia because, well, the Tigers are undefeated! And they’re ranked 14th in the country — not the SEC!
If we had told you that Mizzou 
would be undefeated and ranked among the nation’s top 15 teams by the time it hosted UF, you probably would have burned our papers in some sort of wild, ﬁ  ery display.
Of course, it would have made one 
hell of a party. Just go ahead and do it anyway!
SOMEBODY CALL 9-1-1! SHAW-
TY FIRE BURNING — sorry. We just love to party. So forgive us for chan-neling Sean Kingston right there, and we’ll forgive you for burning our newspapers in some bonﬁ  re rager you have this weekend.
Whenever democracy triumphs, it’s 
something worth celebrating. So may your parties be merry! And remember to raise the debt ceil — uh, roof!
This week, two kids hanging out by 
themselves just looking at their shoes over by the punch bowl — alligator-Sports Assistant Editor Adam Lichten-stein and alligatorSports Staff Writer Adam Pincus — debate this Saturday’s contest between Florida and Mizzou.Picks

Gators to face formidable Tigers run offense
MEN’S BASKETBALL
LANDON WATNICK
Alligator Staff Writer @LandonWatnick
Coach Billy Donovan received some good 
news Thursday regarding injuries and ill-
ness.
Senior forward Will Yeguete (knee) and 
Rutgers transfer guard Eli Carter (leg) have been cleared by team trainers to participate in limited contact drills, UF announced.
After missing practice earlier this week, 
sophomore shooting guard Michael Frazier II (virus) was also cleared Thursday. The coaching staff initially feared he could have mononucleosis, but tests came back nega-tive.
If Frazier were to have contracted mono, 
he could have missed up to six weeks.
“I feel pretty good,” Frazier said in a re-
lease. “Much better than the other day.” The news on the injury front Thursday 
was not all good for the Gators. Sophomore guard Dillon Graham rolled his ankle dur-ing practice, according to the school. He was carried off the court and did not return. 
Florida’s lack of bodies 
in practice has been the big-gest story of its preseason. But if the injury bug carries into the start of the 2013-14 season, senior center Patric Young is prepared for the challenge. 
“First three games of 
the season, I might have to be playing 38 minutes because we are down to seven guys due to injuries and illnesses right now,” he said.
Young takes shot at UK: Young has a message for Kentucky: Hype does not mat-ter.
Kentucky is the media’s pick to win the 
SEC this season, while Florida was chosen second. 
“I hope they think they can just walk on 
the court and they’re going to beat every-body,” Young, a preseason All-SEC second-teamer, said during Southeastern Confer-ence Basketball Media Days on Thursday in Birmingham, Ala. 
“As soon as they play a real top team, 
they’re going to see it’s not just a walk in the park. One-and-done is not for everybody.”
The Wildcats failed to reach the NCAA 
Tournament last season after winning a na-tional title in 2011-12, but John Calipari’s squad has reloaded with six McDonald’s 
Players cleared to return to limited practice
Frazier II
“They got three 
outstanding backs that 
are all guys that make you 
pay if you miss a play in 
space.”

“Shift happens. I drive automatic.” 
Nick Washington (@NickWashingtonn)  
UF defensive backThe Tigers (+3) will get one 
step closer to earning an invitation 
to Atlanta because…
The Gators are on the brink of 
collapse with their season headed into a black hole — kind of what happens at each successive bar on Bourbon Street. Florida needs this game in the worst way, but Maty Mauk will lead Mizzou to victory. Pour one out for UF’s season.
- Adam Pincus
The Gators (-3) are going to 
dance the night — er, afternoon — away because...
The Tigers will get to tango with 
Florida’s defense. UF has the No. 4 rush defense in the nation, perfect to stop UM’s potent run game. Un-like the above member of our staff, the Gators are over what happened in Louisiana and are ready to take on the Tigers. Y’ALL READY FOR THIS?
-Adam LichtensteinNow onto the picks!
Leading the pack at 34-19-3 is 
alligatorSports editor Phillip “Win-
nie the Tattoo” Heilman, who stopped a stranger at a gas station in Alabama last weekend to admire the man’s bear tattoo. Listen, we know you were more interested in the bear’s honey. We get it. You’re lonely. Just please stop talking up the manliness of the tattoo already.
In second with a record of 32-
21-3 is alligatorSports Staff Writer Joe “CALEB STURGIS” Morgan, who joined Florida coach Will Muschamp as the only two men on Earth to yell out the Miami Dol-phins kicker’s name in their sleep. We know why Will misses Caleb, Joe, but your longing for him is a little weird. Oh, and Josh Scobee called. He said you told him there was room for only one kicker in your heart.
Sitting in third at 31-22-3 is alli-
gatorSports Assistant Editor Adam “Chivalry is dead” Lichtenstein, who decided to send one of our female photographers out alone in the rain at night to fetch the car af-ter the LSU game. Never mind that our parking spot was a mile away — just as long as you don’t get a little bit wet. Hard to believe you have a girlfriend, bud.
Ranked fourth at 30-23-3 is 
FightinGators.com’s Cody “Fall training” Jones, who has been busy tweeting about Gators baseball scrimmages while there is perfectly good football being played. Karsten Whitson may be throwing 95 mph, but grown men are hitting each oth-er! Get your priorities right, man!
Worst among the alligatorSports 
crew and in ﬁ  fth at 28-25-3 is Staff Writer Adam “Oops” Pincus, who could neither stand at attention nor contain his, uh, excitement in an old war story he told in the car on the road to LSU last weekend. Here’s hoping he enjoys stronger and longer-lasting relationships with his future clients.
In sixth at 27-26-3 is 247Sports.
com’s Thomas “Heisenberg” Gold-kamp, who daydreamed about how much money he could make on the side as an entrepreneur in a certain shady business. Just stick with the game ﬁ  lm analysis, bud. Of course, we could see you getting all Walter White-crazy if a ﬂ  y found its way into your ﬁ  lm room.
Barely below .500 at 26-27-3 is 
the Orlando Sentinel’s Edgar “Tar-dy Pass” Thompson, who apolo-gized to Florida offensive coordi-nator Brent Pease after showing up late to a press conference last week. Thankfully, Pease gave him a pass — just that one time, though. You can’t really blame Edgar. Back when he was in grade school, the nuns beat him with a ruler when he showed up late.
And in dead-ass last with a piss-
poor record of 24-29-3 is InsideThe-Gators.com’s Bryan “Beef Baby” Holt, who recounted how his mother used to work at Arby’s. It all makes sense now. We’ve always thought you were made entirely of Beef ‘N Cheddar sandwiches — on-ion bun and all. Your little anecdote conﬁ  rms our suspicions. FRIDAY, OCTOBER 18, 2013  ALLIGATOR, 15

Kentucky named SEC preseason favorite at media day
All-Americans – including forward Julius 
Randle, the media’s preseason selection for SEC Player of the Year.
“I am not surprised, coming out of high 
school, there is all the hype and what-not. It doesn’t really mean too much,” Young said.“The one that really counts is the one at 
the end of the year. This guy (Randle) has not gone through any adversity or played a single minute yet, so we will see how things turn out.”
Florida’s new motto: Young revealed 
Thursday that the team’s mantra for the 2013-14 season is “S.W.A.G.” – an acronym for “Strengthen When Adversity Grows.”“We need to strengthen as adversity 
gets more and more in our face,” Young said. “We need to stay together and be con-nected.” 
Added Donovan: “Those guys came up 
with it themselves. It’s kind of what they wanted to do.”
Gators at No. 8 in poll: The ﬁ  rst released 
poll of the 2013-14 season, the ESPN/USA Today coaches preseason poll, has Florida sitting at No. 8. 
Kentucky, Michigan State, Louisville, 
Duke and Arizona round out the top ﬁ  ve. 
No. 6 Kansas, No. 13 Memphis, No. 19 
Connecticut and No. 21 Wisconsin are on UF’s non-conference slate this season. 
“Those kind of games is where you learn 
a lot about yourself from,” Donovan said.

Obamacare lets you keep your parents’ health plan until age 26, costs as little as $1/month after that, and offers free birth control, 
doctor’s visits, and mental health beneets. Don’t let Republicans play you for a fool.

The Gators will see pink when they take 
the field at James G. Pressly Stadium to-
night.
October is Breast Cancer Awareness 
Month, and coach Becky Burleigh believes it is important to host a “Kicking for the Cure” match yearly.
Her mother, Nancy, is not only a breast 
cancer survivor, but she has survived three other forms of the disease. She attends ev-ery game she can to support her daughter.
“She sits in the same spot and wears a 
pin with a picture of me when I was 10,” Burleigh said.
Burleigh also said the disease has im-
pacted several players on the team.“To be able to play a game in their honor 
is just something that we’re proud to do,” Burleigh said. 
“To play for a group of people like that 
is just really inspiring.”
When No. 8 Florida 
(10-3-1, 4-2 Southeast-ern Conference) takes on No. 23 Kentucky (11-
2-1, 5-1 SEC) at 6:30 p.m., the Gators will be playing with the cause in mind.
Kentucky comes to Gainesville tied for 
the second-best record in the league with South Carolina and Texas A&M.
“They always seem to get really up on 
our game,” Burleigh said of the Wildcats. 
“They’re trying to defend their place in 
the lineup of the SEC teams, so it’s up to us to dictate to them and make sure we bring our A-game.”
In 2012, Florida lost to Kentucky 2-1 in 
Lexington, Ky. UK defender Arin Gilliland sank a penalty kick past goalkeeper Taylor Burke en route to the 2-1 win.
This season, Gilliland is still a threat.She is the reigning SEC Offensive Player 
of the Week after she scored a hat trick on Oct. 11 in a 4-1 win against Tennessee.
But Kentucky won’t be Florida’s only 
challenge this weekend. LSU, the SEC leader, comes to Gainesville on Sunday. 
The Tigers hold the top spot with a 5-0-
1 record in the SEC, and Burleigh said it is up to the Gators to change that.
“We need to get better at the stats that 
reflect toughness,” Burleigh said.
Florida’s defense has been on point with 
developing that toughness, but the key to taking on LSU will come from using the outside backs in offensive roles.
Junior outside back Lauren Silver said 
using the width of the field and helping the team score early is what will make the dif-ference this weekend. 
“We like to score goals, and we like to 
show other teams that we can score goals,” Silver said. 
“Getting that early goal in will help us 
get on a roll of scoring goals.”
Although wins are important, Burleigh 
is intent on honoring her mother this week-end.
“I tell my mom all the time that she’s 
like a cat because she has nine lives,” Bur-leigh said. “I really am inspired by her abil-ity to just deal with whatever limitations she has on a daily basis.”

With the cross country season 
approaching its final stretch, the 
Gators are hoping to have another strong outing as they head to Madi-son, Wis., for the Wisconsin adidas Invitational.
Coach Paul Spangler plans to 
use the races on Saturday — an 8K for the men and a 6K for the women — to see if any last-minute adjust-ments need to be made to either team before the Southeastern Con-ference Championships on Nov. 1.
“Obviously we want to do well,” Spangler said. “We all have to com-pete 100 percent and use this as re-ally a final tune-up and a confidence builder for the SECs.”
The men’s 
team, which has 
won all three of its competi-tions this season, hopes to keep up its momentum at the meet.
“I’m looking 
forward to go-
ing up there as a team and seeing how we stack up with the rest of the teams in the nation,” junior Eddie Garcia said. “It’s going to be a big test for us before SECs, so we’re re-ally excited.”
The women, who have finished 
in the top three in each of their meets this season, will be receiving a boost heading into Wisconsin — redshirt junior Cory McGee and senior Shel-by Hayes will return to the lineup.
McGee has yet to compete for 
the Gators after running at the 2013 IAAF World Championships in Moscow over the summer.
“She will obviously come in and 
help us out, not only from a leader-ship standpoint, but also as a team scorer,” Spangler said of McGee. “So it’s good to have her in the mix as we head into the big meet.”
With McGee missing the first 
three meets of the season and Hayes not running since the season-open-ing Western Carolina Invitational on Aug. 30, Agata Strausa has paved the way for the team. She led the women at both meets she ran at — the Western Carolina Invita-tional and the Mountain Dew Invi-tational.
“I really like the leadership posi-
tion I have,” the Latvia native said. “For this race, Cory McGee will be back … and it’s going to be the both of us leading on the team, so I’m re-ally excited for that.”
As a whole, the teams feel pre-
pared.
“We’re all excited to transform 
what we have done at practice into a race,” Strausa said. 
“It’s, in a way, kind of scary 
because practicing and racing are so different and that they are two different worlds, but since we’ve shown that we’re fit and we’re ready to race, we’re going into this really positive.”
