In an effort to help Gainesville resi-
dents prepare themselves for the recent 
sub-freezing temperatures, local organi-zations are providing tips and resources to confront the harrowing weather. 
Gainesville Regional Utilities issued a 
list of cold-weather tips to keep homes safe and energy efficient. 
To prevent frozen water pipes, residents 
are advised to keep water continuously flowing and to cover exposed pipes, ac-cording to a news release. 
GRU also advised homeowners to pur-
chase carbon monoxide detectors and to look out for that “rotten egg” smell, which usually signals a gas leak. If there are signs of irregular gas levels, residents should 
leave the house and call 911, according to 
the release.
To cut down on utility costs, residents 
are encouraged to keep their thermostats at 68 degrees. If kept above the recommended temperature, homeowners could see a hike in their next utility bills by a few percentage points per degree.
Instead, residents should layer up with 
blankets and extra clothing, said GRU con-servation specialist Amy Carpus.
“You don’t want to keep pushing that 
thermostat up and get a higher bill when 
you could’ve just thrown on an extra 
sweater,” Carpus said.
She also added that space heaters 
should be used briefly to warm a room up rather than relied on as the primary source of heat.Florida linebacker

Student access to adventures just got easier 
at UF.
Students interested in participating in the 
Travel and Recreation Program will no longer 
have to wait in line to register for the excur-
sions. 
Online exclusive registration for TRiP pro-
grams will open Jan. 22 at 10 a.m. 
Veronica Adorisio, a 19-year-old UF sus-
tainability and business sophomore, went on 
TRiP’s excursion to Foster Falls, Tenn., last se-
mester. Adorisio said to register for her trip to 
the falls she waited more than four hours in line while it rained. 
“Now it’s more convenient. Everyone has 
a chance to sign up,” she said. “If you always had class on the registration time and day, then you were out of luck.” 
Previously, students looking to register for 
TRiP waited in lines lasting more than three 
hours outside the Outfitter in the Reitz Union, 
said Jackie Matthews, a program coordinator for the TRiP Outfitter and Free Bike Repair. 
“We wanted to make our registration 
more inclusive,” Matthews said. “There is a computer in the Outfitter for students’ conve-nience, if they want to pop in and sign up for TRiP.”
TRiP excursion manager Danielle Irwin, 
21, said students can read about trips open for registration on the new webpage, studentin-volvement.ufl.edu/TRiP, which is part of the Student Activities and Involvement site.No more

Gainesville Police arrested a local woman 
early Monday morning after police said she 
tried to headbutt an officer who pulled her over for drunk driving.
Police arrested Toccara Oscarsha Kleckley, 32, on charges of battery and assault on an of-ficer, driving under the influence and resisting an officer, according to an arrest report.
At about 1 a.m., an officer driving to the 
Alachua County jail requested backup for a “reckless driver” driving in front of the police car, according to the report.
An officer stopped the car, which was driv-en by Kleckley. Another officer then arrived at the scene and asked Kleckley to perform field sobriety tests, according to the report.
Kleckley agreed and told 
the officer she had been drinking Ciroc vodka ear-lier in the night.
When Kleckley could not complete parts of 
the test, the officer arrested her. Kleckley tried to headbutt the officer and spit on the officer’s face, according to the report. Officers had to tackle Kleckley to the ground and led her, kicking and flailing, into the car.
Officers had to strap Kleckley in a spit 
mask and foot restraint. On the way to the jail, 
she began speaking to someone or something, 
“possibly Jesus,” according to the report.
Officers booked Kleckley into the jail at 
about 1:30 a.m. Monday, where she remained as of press time in lieu of a $90,000 bond.Local woman arrested after trying to headbutt police officersee Trip, p Age 4see WeATher, p Age 4

  Aubrey StolzenbergSatanists in Oklahoma City and 
beyond,” temple spokesman Lu-cien Greaves said in a statement. “The statue will also have a func-tional purpose as a chair where people of all ages may sit on the lap of Satan for inspiration and contemplation.”
The Satanic Temple maintains 
that the Oklahoma Legislature’s decision to authorize a privately funded Ten Commandments monument at the Capitol opened the door for its statue. The Ten Commandments monument was placed on the north steps of the building in 2012, and the Oklaho-ma chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union has sued to have it removed.
Similar requests for monu-
ments have been made by a Hindu leader in Nevada, an ani-mal rights group and the satirical Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster.
The push by the Satanic Tem-
ple has rankled elected leaders in 
this conservative state known as 
the buckle of the Bible Belt, who say such a proposal would never be approved by the commission.
“I think you’ve got to re-
member where you are. This is Oklahoma, the middle of the heartland,” said Rep. Don Armes (R- Okla.).

Homeless Mass. man not hard-
rock band’s drummer
GLOUCESTER, Mass. — He 
wasn’t asked to play a few licks on the drums, but police in Glouc-ester quickly determined that the homeless man they found at a city business wasn’t who he claimed to be.
When ofﬁ  cers responded to 
the business Thursday to as-sist employees with the man, he claimed he was the drummer for the 1980s-era hard-rock band Whitesnake.
The Gloucester Times reports 
that a quick check of records indi-cated that was not true.
The man, who had no known 
address, had been asked to leave an apartment building earlier in the night when he was found sleeping in the doorway.
The unnamed man was taken 
to a hospital for evaluation.

Back to the future? Time travel missing on Twitter
WASHINGTON — Time trav-
elers, if they really exist, seem to 
be keeping their adventures to 
themselves.
Researchers with perhaps a 
bit too much time on their hands 
conducted an extensive Inter-
net and social media search for 
evidence of time travelers going back in history and then bragging about it online.
And they came up empty. No 
real life Dr. Who or Marty McFly from “Back to the Future” tweet-ing secrets a bit early.
Spurred by idle chat during 
Thursday poker games, an as-trophysicist and his students at Michigan Technological Univer-sity in Houghton, Mich., searched for mentions of Pope Francis and Comet ISON before they popped into reality. Francis was elected pope last March, and ISON was ﬁ  rst detected in September 2012.
The idea: If someone mentions 
Pope Francis in a 2011 tweet, Face-book post or blog item, then they must have come back from the fu-ture with special knowledge.
But no one posted anything 
prescient.
And last September, the re-
searchers asked people to tweet “#Icanchangethepast2” — but do it before August, a month earlier. Again, no one did.
The disappointing results, re-
jected by three physics journals, will be presented Tuesday at the American Astronomical Society conference in Washington.
If someone went back in time 
and said something to hint about the future, it would prove the concept of time travel, said astro-physicist Robert Nemiroff.
He said this was merely sum-
mer fun that cost nothing to do.
“This wasn’t a major research 
push,” Nemiroff said Monday at the astronomy meeting. “This was typing things into search engines. Billions of dollars are spent on time travel movies and books 
and stuff like that. This prob-
ably costs less than a dollar to 
check on it.”
Nemiroff said this isn’t his 
normal ﬁ  eld, and he didn’t 
much believe in traveling back-
ward in time before — and be-
lieves less in it now. “Unless I go back (in time) and publish lots of papers,” he joked.
Other scientists didn’t take it 
too seriously either.
Harvard astronomer Avi 
Loeb said in an email, “As any-one who uses online dating 
knows, the Internet is the last 
place to ﬁ  nd the truth about the 
physical reality.”

NC politician writes resignation letter in Klingon
INDIAN TRAIL, N.C. — 
Call it a politician boldly going 
where no one has gone before.
On Thursday, David Wad-
dell used the Klingon language to write his letter of resignation 
from the Indian Trail Town 
Council in North Carolina.
Waddell says he opted to use 
Klingon, the language of a war-
rior race on the “Star Trek” TV 
shows and movies, as an inside 
joke. Mayor Michael Alvarez 
is calling the letter unprofes-sional.
Waddell says he is resigning 
at the end of this month. His 
four-year term expires in De-
cember 2015.
Waddell says he also needs 
to devote time to mounting 
a write-in campaign on the 
Constitution Party’s platform 
against U.S. Sen. Kay Hagan (D — N.C.).

Group unveils Satan statue design for Oklahoma
OKLAHOMA CITY — A 
satanic group unveiled designs Monday for a 7-foot-tall statue of Satan it wants to put at the Oklahoma state Capitol, where a Ten Commandments monu-ment was placed in 2012.
The New York-based Satan-
ic Temple formally submitted its application to a panel that oversees the Capitol grounds, including an artist’s rendering that depicts Satan as Baphom-et, a goat-headed ﬁ  gure with horns, wings and a long beard that’s often used as a symbol of the occult. In the rendering, Satan is sitting in a pentagram-adorned throne with smiling children next to him.

LA BELLE, Fla. — An endangered Florida pan-
ther that was rescued as a kitten has died less than a 
year after being released back into the wild, officials 
said Monday.
The young male panther’s radio collar alerted of-
ficials Friday that the animal was not moving and 
could be dead, said Florida Fish and Wildlife Con-
servation Commission spokeswoman Carli Segel-
son.
The lethargic panther was found on private land 
in Hendry County and taken to a veterinary clinic, where it died Saturday, Segelson said.
The panther had been in the same general area for 
the previous five days, but the cause of death wasn’t immediately clear, Segelson said. It was in an area with abundant deer and wild hog populations, and 
its movements were typical for a male panther.
A necropsy is planned at the wildlife commis-
sion’s laboratory in Gainesville.
The panther and its sister were rescued by wild-
life officials in September 2011 in Collier County af-
ter their mother was found dead. They were raised in 
captivity before being released separately last year.
Instead of releasing the male in southwest Flori-
da, where the core population of panthers are found, officials took it to Palm Beach County, to the eastern 
edge of known panther breeding grounds. 
Young males can be attacked and killed by larger, 
older panthers securing their territory, and officials wanted to give this panther more space to roam in 
an area with fewer competitors.
Florida panthers once roamed the entire south-
eastern U.S., but only about 160 remain in the wild, 
and it’s rare for the big cats to be cared for in captiv-
ity and then released.
This is the second panther death reported in 2014. 
A panther that had been roaming a Naples neighbor-
hood was killed last week after colliding with a car involved in a multi-vehicle crash.Florida panther

The Career Resource Center is 
ready to help students with their re-
sumes, outfits and even their selfies.
For the first time, the center’s an-
nual Open House, to be held Mon-
day from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. in the 
CRC, will feature a booth for Pre-Showcase Selfies.
Dana McPherson, assistant direc-
tor of marketing and communica-tions for the center, said the center is hoping students will post the photos on their social media profiles with the hashtag “#IamShowcase.”
The goal of the event, McPherson 
said, is to prepare students for Ca-reer Showcase, which will take place Jan. 21 and 22.
She said she expects about 200 
students to attend the open house, 
which will include workshops on 
Gator CareerLink and resume build-ing and a series on  professional dress hosted by Dillard’s.
“We’re using this open house as 
a tool,” she said. “The workshops we’re offering this year kick off next week and all of our professional de-velopment events.”
With Career Showcase a week af-
ter the open house, Bruna Bouhid, a 22-year-old international studies senior and marketing intern for the center, said the event may help stu-dents get organized before the big day. 
“As students, we procrastinate,” 
she said. “We do need to spend some time beforehand preparing.”
Bouhid said she expects the most 
popular event to be on resume build-ing.
“There are so many things that 
are said about resumes,” she said. “It will be really helpful to have an extra set of eyes to look at it.”#Selfies on CRC Open House agenda

CRC marketing intern“It uses a lot of electricity,” she 
said, “and anything that could be 
flammable anywhere near it could be a risk.”Local apartment complexes are 
sending out similar warnings to 
residents. University Club Apart-
ments encouraged tenants to keep water dripping and to purchase in-surance to cover any possible dam-age. Canopy Apartments informed its residents not to be alarmed by the smell of burning dust, which results 
from increased use of the heater. 
Elsewhere in Gainesville, orga-
nizations are working to make sure 
Gainesville’s homeless population stays warm. The St. Francis House and the Alachua County Coali-tion for the Homeless and Hungry implemented its Cold Night Shelter program Monday night.
The program, which is activated 
when night temperatures are lower than 45 degrees, provides shelter and food for those in need as well as motel vouchers for additional space.
From October 2012 to March 
2013, about 2,200 people took ad-vantage of the program, said John 
Wachtel, Gainesville’s neighbor-
hood improvement coordinator. Wachtel is expecting many people to take advantage of the program this week with the recent below-freezing temperatures.
“The colder the nights, the more 
people that come in,” he said.
Those interested should visit the 
St. Francis House, Wachtel said. 
“They’ll make sure you get taken 
care of,” he said.   4, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, JANUARY 7, 2014

UF researchers have been working to cre-
ate a better-tasting tomato and a way to keep 
it fresh longer.
Harry Klee, a professor in the horticultural 
sciences department at UF, said the ultimate 
goal of his roughly 12 years of work was to 
create a tastier tomato and to benefit consum-er health.
“We think that if we make stuff that tastes 
pretty good, it’ll improve diets,” he said. 
Klee said he and other researchers are hop-
ing that a seed company will pick up the two varieties of hybrid tomatoes they developed.
Sean Eason, a 21-year-old UF English se-nior, said he likes the current taste of toma-toes but said the research is a good thing.
“If healthier eating tastes better, I suppose 
more people will be more into it,” he said, “and that’s 
always a good idea.”
In addition to the to-
mato research, four years 
of research by UF and the 
University of California,  Davis, on “modified atmo-sphere packaging” is com-ing to an end.  
Jeff Brecht, a UF research foundation 
professor, was involved in the project and said that the goal was “to get fresher, riper foods.”The new packaging method works be-
cause it is made with a semi-permeable layer that allows oxygen to move out of the pack-aging. As the plant respirates, the packaging will allow the oxygen and carbon monoxide to separate, slowing down the metabolism of the fruit or vegetable, as well as the fungi that may be on it.
Although this packaging may drive up 
food costs, Brecht said graduate students will be surveying people to see how much more or less they would be willing to pay for the packaging.
Darin Jagnarine, a 19-year-old UF biomed-
ical engineering sophomore, said he wouldn’t mind paying a little extra for foods in the new packaging. Researchers develop healthier tomatoes, improved packages

MIAMI — A man convicted 
of abducting and killing a Mi-
ami couple and later stabbing a 
prison guard to death is set to 
be executed after nearly four decades on Florida’s death row.
Askari Abdullah Muham-
mad, previously known as Thomas Knight, is scheduled to die by lethal injection Tuesday at Florida State Prison in Starke 
barring a last-minute, success-
ful appeal.
Gov. Rick Scott signed the 
death warrant after the Florida 
Supreme Court in December 
rejected Muhammad’s chal-lenge to chemicals used in the state’s execution procedure.
Muhammad, 62, was first 
condemned to die for the 1974 killings of Sydney and Lillian Gans. Then known as Knight, he had worked for Gans at a 
paper bag company before ab-
ducting him in the business’ parking lot with a rifle. He or-dered Gans to drive home to pick up his wife and then go to 
a bank to withdraw $50,000.
Inside the bank, Gans asked 
a manager to alert authorities. 
Both the FBI and local police 
were able to follow the car for a 
while, including use of aircraft, but lost track of it for a short time in a rural part of south-ern Miami-Dade County. Trial 
testimony showed that’s when 
Muhammad shot the couple in the back of the head and tried to hide by burying himself, the 
rifle and the money in mud 
and weeds.
Muhammad was found a 
short time later and arrested. While awaiting trial, he and 10 
other inmates escaped from the 
local jail, leading to a nation-wide manhunt including a Top 10 fugitives listing by the FBI.
Although he was not 
charged, authorities say Mu-
hammad was involved, after 
his escape, in the fatal October 1974 shooting of liquor store clerk William Culpepper dur-ing an armed robbery in Cord-
ele, Ga. Another clerk was shot 
and wounded, according to lo-cal authorities.
The FBI finally arrested Mu-
hammad on New Year’s Eve in 1974 in New Smyrna Beach, Fla. In his possession were three stolen weapons: a sawed-off shotgun, a .38-cal. revolver 
and a 9 mm handgun.
After his conviction in the 
Gans case, Muhammad in 1980 
fatally stabbed Correction Of-
ficer Richard Burke with the 
sharpened end of a spoon as he was being escorted to the prison shower.
Muhammad was sentenced 
to die for Burke’s killing in 1983.
His execution has been de-
layed for so long because of nu-
merous appeals and rulings in 
the Gans case, including a 1987 federal appeals court tossing out his death sentence because he hadn’t been allowed to put 
character and background wit-
nesses on the stand during the penalty phase.
The decades have worn 
heavily on the Gans fam-ily as they await justice. Their daughter, 72-year-old Harriet Shapiro, said it will be a relief when it’s all over.
“Even though I have no ha-
tred in my heart, and I don’t live with anger, I would be very happy to see him dead 
and stand there when they kill 
him,” Shapiro told The Miami Herald in a recent interview.Execution date set

CAPE CORAL, Fla. — A Florida 
congressman who pleaded guilty to 
cocaine-possession charges last year is returning to Congress.
Republican Rep. Trey Radel says 
he’s looking forward to representing his southwest Florida constituents in Washington again after taking a leave of absence and undergoing treatment in a drug and alcohol re-habilitation center.
In November, Radel pleaded 
guilty to a misdemeanor charge of cocaine possession and was sen-tenced to a year of probation. He admitted to purchasing 3.5 grams of cocaine from an undercover officer in Washington on Oct. 29.
The House Ethics Committee is 
investigating his conduct.
The 37-year-old freshman has re-
sisted calls from several GOP lead-
ers, including Gov. Rick Scott, to 
resign. Last month, Radel pledged to regain the trust of his constituents by redoubling his legislative efforts in the capital. Congressman returns after drug bust
Number of spots on trips won’t increase
Registration and payment for upcoming TRiP excur-
sions will now be completed on the webpage, although registration is not available yet.
“It’s simpler to go online and do it right when you’re 
thinking about it,” said Irwin, a sustainability and the 
built environment senior.
She said students don’t have to worry about going to 
the Outfitter and running out of time to register. 
Irwin added that although more students are expect-
ed to apply online, the number of spots available on trips 
will not increase. 
A list of the 2014 trips and prices are listed on the 
group’s website. The dates for trips will be released fol-lowing drop/add period, when the availability of TRiP leaders is finalized.  Some of the excursions include pad-dling down Silver River, mountain biking in San Felasco 
Hammock Preserve State Park and climbing Sand Rock 
in Alabama. 
UF recreation, parks and tourism senior Destiny 
Kucko, a 21-year-old TRiP leader and education man-ager, said students can still come in and ask questions, but online registration will end some late nights for TRiP employees.

ery half-hour to a price of $9.75 for the whole day. Guests are al-lowed to leave cars overnight un-til 6:30 a.m.
Special parking options for 
football season will be available in 
the Fall to give customers a “safe, 
secure and out-of-the-weather” parking location, Schoen said.
The building currently has two 
restaurants, a clothing store and a jewelry store leasing space. 
However, employees in the 
building have to pay to park in the garage, Schoen said.
Alix Kissinger, the manager 
of Henri Girl — a clothing store in the building — doesn’t park in the garage and continues to use 
a street parking pass for that rea-
son.
“We looked into rates, and 
they’re pretty pricey,” Kissinger said. “They mentioned swipe cards, and they were on the ex-pensive side.”
However, Kissinger said she 
thinks the garage will help attract 
customers.
“I think we will (see an in-
crease) now that it’s open, espe-
cially since we always have a lot of people calling, asking where they can park,” she said. “I think all the signs they have will help get the word out that the parking garage is open, and people will 
be more likely to park there and 
come in and shop.”
Kissinger said overnight park-
ing options were a good idea for those who want to leave their cars somewhere safe.
Some students expressed 
mixed feelings about the garage.
Shane Coll, a 19-year-old UF 
computer science freshman, said he doesn’t see himself using the parking garage.
“It’s easier just to walk,” he 
said. “There’s no reason to park there. It’s so close to campus.”
Dylan Abeles, an 18-year-old 
UF aerospace engineering fresh-man, said the garage could be 
convenient. But he agreed that it’s easier to 
walk than park in the garage.
“It could be worth it if you get a good spot,” he said. “But if I’m not in a rush or anything, I’d just 
park on campus.”The garage was the last part of 
the luxury condo and retail com-plex to be completed in Summer.

� ALL PROCEEDS GO TO THE 
MAYO CLINIC.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
JACKSONVILLE — Two years 
ago, Patrick McLaughlin of Jackson-
ville was in the Mayo Clinic for mi-nor nasal surgery.
But routine preparatory tests 
turned up something potentially far worse. A lesion on his pancreas led to a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, which, for 85 percent of people, kills within six months.
“It is one of the worst cancers one 
can have,” said McLaughlin, now 66. “There are not a lot of people (survivors) running around.”
After surgery, chemotherapy and 
radiation treatment, he is one of the survivors. So he decided to support other people who get the same dev-
astating diagnosis by helping found 
a Jacksonville-based nonproﬁ  t, the Florida Pancreas Cancer Coalition Inc., to raise funds for Florida-based pancreatic cancer research.
“I did a lot of soul-searching,” he said. “I can speak for people who can’t speak for themselves.”
In the early months of the new 
year, the ﬂ  edgling, all-volunteer co-alition will have his attention.
The goal is to support local re-
search, “where our local neighbors can...actually see and experience where their money is going and 
what it is accomplishing,” accord-
ing to the website. The group plans to have periodic meetings with pa-tients, their families and friends to discuss common issues.
McLaughlin and other board members are planning their ﬁ  rst major fundraiser in March, the Cul-hane’s Celtic Open golf tournament.
Since the coalition has not yet re-
ceived ofﬁ  cial nonproﬁ  t status from the IRS, the event will be present-ed by a partner organization, the Northeast Florida Scottish Games and Festival.
All proceeds will go to pancreatic 
cancer research at Mayo.
Mayo has not sponsored or en-
dorsed the coalition but is “grate-ful that they want to raise funds for Mayo Clinic for pancreatic cancer research,” said clinic spokesman Paul Scotti.
McLaughlin said there is enough 
“world-class research going on” statewide for Florida-focused fund-raising. But he fretted that only 2 percent of the National Cancer Insti-tute’s budget goes to pancreatic can-cer research, despite the high fatality 
odds.
Howard Crawford, an associate 
professor of cancer biology who is 
on Mayo’s research faculty, said it’s simply harder to deal with than many other cancers.

 ABC, it’s time to 
revamp ‘The Bachelor’
Last night, the new year saw a new crop of screaming, 
swooning female hopefuls on “The Bachelor,” which began its 18th season on ABC. The premise of “The 
Bachelor” and its sister show, “The Bachelorette,” represents something both modern and weirdly primal: Cameras, boom 
mics and Chris Harrison follow a group of 20-somethings as 
they compete ﬁ  ercely for the affection of a mate — presum-ably so the winner and said mate may become engaged and begin a life together.
Each season is purported to be “the most dramatic yet,” 
“historical” and “like nothing viewers have seen before on ‘The Bachelor.’” Over its 18-season run, the show has operat-ed along a formula that relies on tired, gendered stereotypes. When seasons like this one center on a group of women vying 
for one man’s affection, these gendered stereotypes become 
even clearer: The women are continually portrayed as hys-terically emotional, hell-bent on procuring a husband. The female contestants are constantly pitted against one another, and phrases such as “I’m not here to make friends,” and “The claws are starting to come out,” are tossed about frequently.
The male contestants on “The Bachelorette” are much 
luckier: They’re rewarded for letting vulnerability shine through their masculine exteriors. The ones who tend to win 
have a level of sensitivity normally found only on the pages of 
Nicholas Sparks novels. Indeed, the male “Bachelorette” win-ners are rewarded for balancing their masculine and feminine sides for the beneﬁ  t of viewers, while the women on “The Bachelor” seem to display only exaggerated acts of feminin-ity: They cry at the drop of a hat, they become immediately emotionally invested in the man they’ve only just met, they engage in screaming ﬁ  ghts with each other, and they spend hours preening before group dates.
We can only hope that the network’s casting choices and 
editing are to blame for the way women are portrayed on “The Bachelor.” Season after season, the majority of them have vague, ubiquitously feminine careers: hair stylists, makeup artists, yoga instructors, models, dancers, “entrepre-neurs” and “consultants.” They, as Jezebel pointed out, seem to subsist solely on fruit, nuts and Diet Coke. Occasionally, women with personality and apparent intellect are featured on the show: lawyers, oil-ﬁ  eld account managers, girls who 
cite “Atlas Shrugged” as their favorite book and one, this 
season, who broke the fruit-and-nut loving mold by naming Flamin’ Hot Cheetos as her favorite snack.
However, those women are eventually weeded out, and 
women of color rarely make it to the ﬁ  nal rounds. No, the majority of “The Bachelor” winners are thin, white and hope-lessly two-dimensional — or they appear to be.
While we would never dream of suggesting ABC pull 
“The Bachelor” forever — it is, after all, the guilty pleasure of 
all guilty pleasures — it’s time the network considered hiring 
new producers. Female contestants, just like the male contes-
tants, should be afforded the same amount of depth and de-
velopment. Hamba kahle Madiba: Goodbye, Mandela
South Africa was to be my birthplace. Zambia, where 
I was eventually born, didn’t have the best mater-nity care in southern Africa in the early 1990s, and 
my parents were advised to move. Eventually, things worked out, and there was no need for my mom to go to Durban, South Africa.
Over Winter Break, South Africa’s greatest son, Nel-
son Mandela, was buried. Perhaps you saw the funeral coverage or the movies, but I was exposed to his magic another way.
Madiba, as he was known to his beloved people, was a 
young lawyer in 1962 when he was arrested and faced the death penalty on charges of sabotage against the apart-heid government of South Africa. In a four-hour speech from his dock, he kept his cool, saying he was “prepared to die” for “the ideal of a democratic and free society.”
Mandela was sentenced to life in prison. His politi-
cal group was banned and moved its headquarters to Zambia. For the next few decades, the city of my birth, Lusaka, hosted Mandela’s political organization. Lusaka experienced turmoil in the coming years as white apart-heid supporters violently targeted the black activists who worked in exile. 
And then, ﬁ  nally, the day arrived. The year was 1990. 
The agony of 27 years made the occasion that much sweeter.
I was yet to be born, but my parents tell me that Lu-
saka erupted that day. A joyous frenzy overcame the city as news spread that Madiba was released. The pictures published the next day were moving — the valiant son of Africa, who had now gone gray-haired, walked out of the prison gates, his ﬁ  st raised.
Shortly after being freed, Mandela began to spread 
global awareness against the South African apartheid system. His ﬁ  rst stop was Lusaka, to give thanks to the city that sheltered his political and biological families during his 27 years in prison.When Nelson Mandela has 
personal ties to your birthplace, you can get lucky. I grew up hearing of how my mom wept when her prayers were an-swered with Madiba’s release and how my older brother’s ﬁ  rst formative childhood mem-ory was of watching Mandela’s 
presidential inauguration — Mandela had invited his former prison guard to the ceremony!
But interestingly, the bandwagon wasn’t always full. 
The U.S. supported the apartheid government for de-cades. Mandela was only taken off our terrorist watch list in 2008. 
President Ronald Reagan justiﬁ  ed allying with the 
apartheid regime by saying, at the time, that South Africa is strategically “essential to the free world in its produc-tion of minerals.”
Even on campus, the cruelty of apartheid is yet to be 
realized.
Our Student Senate is voting on a resolution calling 
for UF to “build upon its partnership” with the State of Israel. Considering how Israel is known for its ongoing abuse against its Palestinian subjects — while enjoying impunities like those apartheid South Africa enjoyed in its heyday — such a proposal is embarrassing.
“Our freedom is incomplete without the freedom of 
the Palestinians,” Mandela said. 
Cozying up with Israel won’t rufﬂ  e many feathers, 
reminiscent of how our misguided ancestors had little is-sue with cozying up with black apartheid.
Madiba’s long walk has come to an end, and a time 
will come when we, too, will leave. Before we go irre-versibly astray, should we not learn from the past?

Another year has come and gone. 
America began 2013 facing a num-ber of difﬁ  cult political and societal 
challenges, including an unemployment rate of 7.9 percent, increasing rates of eco-nomic inequality and poverty, and the ever-looming specter of global climate change.
Unfortunately, and perhaps unsurpris-
ingly, the federal government failed to seri-ously address many of these vital issues in 2013. The current Congress is on pace to be the least productive in American history, with only 55 bills passed into law over the past year.
The Senate did pass many important 
pieces of legislation in 2013, including com-prehensive immigration reform and the Em-ployment Non-Discrimination Act, which would prohibit workplace discrimination  on the basis of sexual orientation. However, it seems as though these bills were neither considered by the Republican-controlled House, nor did House leaders propose any constructive alternatives to the Senate bills.
Naturally, Speaker of the House John 
Boehner claimed without hesitation that the House had “done [its] work” during the past year.
In fact, Boehner thought so highly of the 
House’s performance in 2013 that he decid-ed to give his fellow legislators 13 extra days off this year. The House will be in session for 113 days in 2014, compared to 126 days last year.
Americans did not share 
Boehner’s positive view of Con-gress’ effectiveness in 2013. Ac-cording to an AP poll, Congress ﬁ  nished the year with a disapproval rating of 83 percent among Democrats and 87 per-cent among Republicans.
President Obama and his administration 
also had a difﬁ  cult 2013.  The ﬂ  awed rollout of the Affordable Care Act, the president’s signature health care reform bill, increased skepticism about the capacity of the federal government to meet the needs of the Ameri-can people.
President Barack Obama ﬁ  nished the 
year with some of the lowest approval rat-ings of his ﬁ  ve years in ofﬁ  ce.  The same AP poll found that 46 percent of Americans ap-prove of the president’s performance while 50 percent disapprove.
Our country faces challenges that grow 
more daunting every day, and many of them can only be resolved with bold action on the part of our government. The most important of these issues, and one that has major implications for Ameri-can society, is the increasing rate of economic inequality in the U.S.
Economic inequality in 
America continues to grow as the ultrarich get wealthier, and middle-class incomes stagnate. According to recent estimates, 
average income for the wealthiest 5 percent of Americans has risen about 17 percent during the last 20 years. During the same period, middle-class incomes have grown by less than 5 percent.
The problem of economic inequality has 
grown even more dramatically during the last few years. From 2009 to 2012, about 95 percent of all income gains went to the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans.
Many economists argue that the grow-
ing disparity between the rich and everyone else has dire negative consequences for the American economy, which is largely fueled by consumer spending. As incomes shrink or stagnate, middle-class Americans have less money to spend on consumer goods, leading to an overall decrease in gross do-mestic product.
There are a number of government poli-
cies that would help confront the problem of economic inequality. The most obvious of these is to raise the federal minimum wage from its current level of $7.25 an hour. If the minimum wage had increased over time at the same rate as inﬂ  ation, it would currently be $10.70 an hour.
Raising the minimum wage would re-
duce economic inequality by boosting working-class incomes. It would thus pro-mote consumer spending, strengthen job creation and lift hundreds of thousands of minimum-wage workers out of poverty.
Given the divided nature of our govern-
ment, it seems unlikely that such progressive solutions to our political challenges will be enacted this year. However, in November, Americans around the country will have the opportunity to cast ballots for members of both the House and Senate.
The 2014 elections will allow voters to 
remove legislators who have obstructed political progress during the last two years and replace them with individuals who will act on behalf of all Americans. Our coun-try must empower leaders who will work to confront the challenges we face, and the upcoming elections present just such an op-portunity.

New Year’s resolution for America 2014: Economic equalityColumn
Were you that kid in el-
ementary school who had a hard time waiting 
your turn to go up on the swing set? Were you that kid who re-fused to eat your vegetables, even though you were most likely to get dessert if you did?
Were you that kid who just wanted every-
thing yesterday? As a young adult born in the 1990s and raised as a millennial, I am not surprised to see kids wanting things right this instant, if not sooner. And as somebody on the autism spectrum, I admit to feeling as though I am more entitled to such rewards — regard-less of whether I legitimately deserve them.
But in a society in which nearly all middle-
class Americans are offered a shower of op-portunities to shine in the spotlight — even if they just breezed their way through school — there has to be some sort of boundary.
As an English and communications student 
at the University of Florida, I am extremely grateful to be in the heart of the Gator Nation. However, my initial educational goal was to attend a top ﬁ  ne-arts program in musical the-
ater with hopes of performing on Broadway 
— and hopefully doing so debt free, despite the $240,000 price tag. 
Even at a performing-arts high school, I 
did not feel conﬁ  dent in my work. My sing-ing and acting were ﬁ  ne — although I wish I’d selected better monologues — but my dance abilities were never up to par. I knew I would 
be rejected but became overconﬁ  dent to avoid 
looking like a fool holding up a letter reading “Dear Mr. McKibbin, We are sorry to say that we cannot offer you a space in Carnegie Mel-lon’s BFA program.”
I’d be perfectly happy with my verdict if 
many of my peers were in the same boat. Un-fortunately, every one of my friends in musi-cal theater got accepted somewhere: Point Park University, Boston Conservatory, Elon 
University, Tisch School of the Arts or Emer-
son College. If I were to read another “Got into [insert BFA program here]” status on Facebook, I would throw my laptop onto the pavement from my second-story bedroom. 
But does it really make a dif-
ference?
Does it really matter if I got into Carnegie 
Mellon University’s drama program — one 
famous for producing stars like Billy Porter, 
Josh Gad, Patina Miller, Christian Borle, Judith Light and Cherry Jones? Honestly, it’s not like I was rejected from its computer science pro-gram. Unlike computer science, where you need to have good credentials in order to get a job, theater is a real crapshoot.
There are people who have talent who nev-
er ﬁ  nished  or even attended college or acting 
school. Just look at Sutton Foster, LaChanze, 
Anne Hathaway and Kelsey Grammer. And if that’s the case, it looks like where you go to school doesn’t seem to make a difference. It’s all about timing, luck and talent.
So quite frankly, even if my Broadway 
debut doesn’t come when I ﬁ  nish my un-dergraduate degree, I won’t mind. It’s not my turn yet. I had to wait a long time for my 
turn before. I couldn’t talk until I was three. I 
wasn’t toilet trained until I was ﬁ  ve. I never took Algebra I before my freshman year of high school, when everybody in my class took the same course in seventh or eighth grade. 
I’m used to being behind my peers. Do I 
like it? Hell no! I’m just used to it. But until I get my turn, I can just suck it up, take more 
acting classes, sing in choir, take more dance 
lessons and audition for as many shows as my schedule allows. When the time is right, maybe I can reapply to Carnegie Mellon. 
Or better yet, maybe I can just move to 
New York and see what happens from there. There’s no deadline, which means I should wait my turn. If we didn’t have to wait our turns on the swing set as children, we might not have enjoyed the experience as much and 
may have moped in the sandbox instead.

A recent United Na-
tions Food and Agri-cultural report ranks 
the U.S. behind only Mexico on its list of the world’s 
most overweight industrialized nations. 
About $147 billion a year in medical costs are currently tied to obesity. 
Explanations commonly fall along 
socioeconomic lines. A 2007 University of Chicago study showed that minority groups in lower income brackets tend to reach higher levels of obesity than ma-jority groups in higher strata do. While 
this correlation exists, eating behavior 
researcher Brian Wansink contends in “Mindless Eating: Why We Eat More Than We Think” that affordability is not what drives overeating. Instead, he attri-butes the epidemic portion size, “a fact that will not change signiﬁ  cantly with changes in affordability of food.”
The “portion problem” results from 
supersizing meals and distorting what Americans consider a normal portion size. Most literature on obesity, while acknowledging existence of the por-tion problem, tends to spend more time decrying farm subsidies, which make fruits and vegetables more expensive than chicken nuggets or sweetened drinks, and school health standards, 
which have historically improved but 
maintain levels of obesity rather than reducing them.
However, focusing only on the eco-
nomics and politics of obesity — not on portion sizing — is a mistake. Aspects of human nature associated with the con-sumption of fatty and sweetened foods are often more indicative of the problem, 
and they can likely shed light on how to 
effectively solve it.
We are prisoners of our own eating 
habits. Certain consumption patterns are essentially embedded in us and shaped during early childhood. Dr. Alison Field, associate professor of pedi-atrics at Harvard Medical School and staff scientist at Children’s Hospital Boston, told the Harvard Political 
Review that “children with large por-tions served to them eat a lot more and are not great at compensating by eating less of other foods.” Exacerbating the problem is the fact that “foods targeted to children in general tend to be high in calories, high in fat, low in ﬁ  ber, and of-ten served in very large portion sizes.”
Once kids grow accustomed to eat-
ing large portions of food placed in front of them at a table or pitched to them through advertisements for prepared food it becomes routine behavior. A study at Yale’s Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity found that 40 percent of children ages 2 to 11 ask their par-ents to go to McDonald’s at least once a week. It is this kind of habitual behavior 
that they carry on a subconscious level 
to adulthood, where many then ﬁ  nd it a tall order to break out of the cycle of blind binging.
A gravitation toward greater portions 
is also fueled by the myriad exterior cir-cumstances. Chin Jou, lecturer of history and science at Harvard and former fel-low at the National Institutes of Health, 
told the Harvard Political Review that 
“people eat out of boredom, for the so-cial aspect of it, to celebrate, or alterna-tively, when they are depressed.”
Along with stronger ban legislation, 
measures that can be taken to cut por-tions include labeling serving-size in-formation on prepared foods to more realistically inform buyers about their 
consumption, as well as mandating that 
restaurants meet certain serving-size regulations.

Following suit of charitable compa-
nies like Toms, a UF student has cre-
ated a clothing company that donates shorts to children in need for every pair sold.
Robert Felder, a 19-year-old UF 
business management sophomore, said he started Bearbottom Cloth-ing with the intention of selling qual-ity shorts as well as giving clothing to those in need. For each pair of shorts sold, Felder donates a pair to children in Bangladesh.
“I want people to buy them be-
cause of the quality of the shorts,” said Felder. “But I also want them to know that they’ll be helping children.”
Felder, who said he is self-taught 
in website design, launched the site, bearbottomclothing.com, last week. The website offers seersucker and twill shorts for men in a variety of colors. All shorts on the website are $30.
He said he only sells men’s shorts 
because he’s just beginning his line, but he’s looking to expand in the future.
Feldman said after traveling to Ban-
gladesh three years ago and seeing the conditions some of the children lived in, he wanted to do his part to improve their quality of life. He recalls driv-ing past a pool of mud where children 
wearing nothing but shorts played 
with garbage.
“That was the image that really 
stuck with me,” he said.
For now, the shorts he donates will 
be given to the children of workers in 
the factory that produces the shorts, lo-
cated in Bangladesh. Felder, who has visited the factory, said the employees work in good conditions, but the dona-tions are welcome. 
Although the shorts sold are adult-
sized, Felder said the donated pairs will be specially made for young chil-dren. After a certain number of shorts 
are sold, he will ship a bulk donation.
He said because other charities al-
ready donate shirts and shoes, shorts 
seemed like a logical choice.
“If you’re gonna donate something 
to people in need, it should be some-thing that should last,” he said. 
He said his goal is to donate 10,000 
pairs this year, which will allow him to expand the donations to schools and other organizations in the country.
Joey Schatt, a 19-year-old UF tele-
communication sophomore, said it’s great a UF student found a way to help out a cause.
“I wish more people around cam-
pus would get involved in community service,” Schatt said.

Marshall Criser III, son of the former UF 
president that Criser Hall is named after, started 
Monday as chancellor of the State University System.
Criser, who had been president of AT&T 
Florida, previously served on UF’s Board of Trustees and graduated from UF with a busi-
ness administration degree. His new position 
as chancellor makes him the chief executive and administrative ofﬁ  cer of the university system, which oversees UF and 11 other universities. 
The Board of Governors, which manages the 
system, unanimously chose him in November after his interview with a search committee. 
“This is a tremendous privilege, and I take it very seriously,” Criser said in a 
press release. “I look forward 
to working hard with other leaders in this state to make our universities the most ac-
countable, accessible and high-achieving in this country.”
Performance-based funding 
and online learning develop-
ment are included in Board of Governors initia-
tives Criser will work on.
“Marshall Criser understands business, and 
he understands our State University System. 
The Board of Governors couldn’t ask for a better 
chancellor,” board vice chair Mori Hosseini said 
in the release. “I look forward to accomplishing great things together.”Gator starts job as chancellor

Seminoles win championship
Florida State defeated Auburn 34-31 to claim the 2014 
BCS National Championship. FSU’s win ended the Southeastern Conference’s seven-year title streak.Coach Rhonda Faehn announced two gymnasts will miss time due to injury. Read the story on page 16.ADAM LICHTENSTEIN
Alligator Staff Writer @alichtenstein24
A depleted Gators defense took another hit on Monday.
Buck linebacker Ronald Powell will leave Florida to en-
ter May’s NFL Draft, the school announced.
“Ronald has informed me that he has made a decision to 
declare for the NFL Draft,” coach Will Muschamp said in a release. “This hasn’t been an easy decision for him. I talked to him several times over the holidays, but it was important for him to come back and look me in the eye and tell me what he wanted to do and why he wanted to do it. 
“It’s one of the great experiences as a coach to watch 
young players mature.”
Powell is the third player to forfeit a year of eligibility in

� FLORIDA HAS NOT LOST SINCE 
NOVEMBER.
GORDON STREISAND
Alligator Writer @GordonStreisand
The last time the Gators lost a game, people’s 
refrigerators were still full of leftover turkey 
and pumpkin pie.
Florida’s last loss 
came in the Bahamas to a then-winless Illinois State team.
“We must not be do-
ing a good enough job of emphasizing the right things,” coach Amanda Butler said after the loss. 
“We’re just not taking enough pride in our 
defense.”
Added assistant coach David Lowery at 
Monday’s press conference: “You saw a team that lost to Illinois State that was still searching 
for its chemistry. 
“We had Cassie Peoples who was still trying 
to get acclimated to things. We were still try-
ing to figure out our rotation. We were going through injuries at that time. We had just lost 
(Antoinette) Bannister … we just had a lot go-
ing on.”
Since that 68-64 loss, Florida has changed 
completely. 
The turnaround started the very next day 
against a physically imposing Oregon State 
squad, but Florida grinded out its toughest vic-
tory to date, 73-70. 
“This was the biggest team we’ve played 
against,” Butler said after the game. “We were 
going to have to be really smart about the way 
we approached the game plan, but when it re-ally came down to it, we had to be resilient.”
The Gators have carried Butler’s message 
throughout the ongoing winning streak. Now 
up to eight consecutive victories, including an 
83-73 upset win against then-No. 6 Kentucky on the road Sunday, Florida’s greatest asset has been its ability to overcome adversity. 
“I think when you go through adversity, it 
brings you closer,” senior Jaterra Bonds said. “We knew we weren’t supposed to lose that game (against Illinois State). We didn’t come out ready to play. We dug our foot down and 
won the next game.”

trip did not solely revolve around basketball. UF riding hot

When Florida started the season 
ranked No. 10 in the nation, freshman 
Kasey Hill started at point guard over 
a suspended Scottie Wilbekin. Dorian 
Finney-Smith was working his way to play with the team, and Damontre Harris was hoping to just stay on it. 
The Gators struggled with their 
lineup consistency due to injuries and suspensions, dropping as low as No. 19 in the national polls.
However, nearly three months af-ter coach Billy Dono-van and company opened the 2013-2014 campaign, Florida is back at No. 10 with 
a restructured squad 
in time for its South-
eastern Conference opener against South 
Carolina on Wednesday.
Donovan said his team didn’t de-
serve the top-10 ranking in October, and although he wouldn’t say if the Gators earned the spot now, he did say he has seen growth both on and off the court.
“I do think we have a group of guys 
who are very, very coachable,” Dono-van said. 
“They’ve accepted their roles. They 
want to play their roles to the best of their abilities. I think we’re an unself-ish team. I think they care about one 
another. I think we have chemistry in-
side of our team.”

GATORS IN THE NFL
� PATRIOTS’ SPIKES OUT 
FOR PLAYOFFS.
  JORDAN MCPHERSON
 Alligator Writer @J_McPherson1126
  With the Wild Card Round of the 
NFL playoffs in the books, here are 
a few former Gators who made the 
most tangible impact for their re-
spective teams this weekend.
 Riley Cooper, 
wide receiver: Although the Philadelphia Ea-gles fell at home 
to the New Or-
leans Saints 26-24 on Saturday, Riley Cooper 
still managed to make big plays.
  The fourth-year wide receiver 
led both teams with six catches and 68 receiving yards. Cooper also notched a 10-yard touch-
down catch on a pass from quar-
terback Nick Foles to give the Eagles a 7-3 lead with 1:48 left in 
the ﬁ  rst half.
Cooper also had a 22-yard 
reception to start Philadelphia’s 
six-play, 44-yard scoring drive.
 Cooper, who was moved up 
to the starting lineup after Eagles receiver Jeremy Maclin suffered a torn right ACL before the season began, ﬁ  nished the regular sea-
son with career highs in recep-
tions (47), yards (835) and touch-downs (eight).   
Ray McDonald, defensive 
lineman: The San Francisco 49ers 
were the only winning team that 
saw considerable action from a former Gator this weekend.
  Defensive tackle Ray McDon-
ald, a third-round pick in the 2007 draft, notched four tackles and split a sack of Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers with linebacker Aldon Smith  in the 
ﬁ  rst quarter en route to his team’s 
23-20 win over the Packers on Sunday.
  The seventh-year veteran has 
recorded 37 tackles and 3.5 sacks this season.
  Spikes placed on IR: The New 
England Patriots will be without their starting middle linebacker when they face the Indianapolis Colts on Saturday. 
  The Patriots announced Mon-
day that they placed Brandon Spikes on injured reserve with a knee injury — one that bothered him for much of the season.

son with 86 tackles in his fourth year with the Patriots . Eagles’

Things started to cement themselves for the Gators soon after 
the Junkanoo Jam, both on and off the court. 
“We didn’t just go over there to play basketball, we went over 
there to bond as a family,” Lowery said. 
“We had opportunities to do things outside of basketball. I think 
that played a huge part in where we are right now. Our kids are 
totally buying in and really accepting the responsibility to do their 
part on the floor when they need to do it.”
So far, Butler’s call for resiliency has seemingly been answered. 
In these past eight games, four games were decided by 10 or fewer 
points — all in the Gators’ favor. For Bonds, it has been a long time coming.  
“In the past few seasons I’ve been here, we haven’t toughed out 
and won close games,” she said. 
“For instance, that Georgetown game was a big game. All our 
post players were fouled out. We could have quit right there. I knew, when it went into overtime, I told everybody, ‘We’re going to win this game.’ I knew we were more conditioned than them and were more ready than them.”have now played five games in the backcourt together. Florida won all of those matchups.
Casey Prather has emerged as 
the Gators’ go-to offensive weap-on after finishing the non-confer-ence schedule with a team-high 17.3 points per game. 
The senior forward averaged 
only 3.1 points per game during his previous three years at Flor-ida.
If Chris Walker receives the 
go-ahead from the NCAA, he will join Finney-Smith and Patric Young, who averaged 15 points in UF’s last two games, in a flour-
ishing frontcourt.
Donovan said with all the 
pieces finally coming together 
just before SEC competition be-
gins, it’s like the Gators are start-
ing from square one.
“Our team has kind of evolved 
with the addition of different players, but between suspensions 
and injuries, the first probably 
eight ... games we were never re-ally playing with a full roster,” Donovan said. 
“I think our guys understand, 
as everybody does, it’s almost like, OK, now the season is start-
ing. 
“It’s two things. One, you’ve 
got the season starting somewhat 
new and fresh, but you build a resume in your first 12, 13, 14 games for some teams.”
Will Yeguete said having the 
ups and downs of the non-con-ference schedule has helped the team find itself and become more prepared for the start of confer-
ence play.
He added that experience 
playing with each other during 
the first half of the season, as well as the experience of the four se-niors, will give the Gators an ad-
vantage against their SEC foes.
“I think it helps a lot, know-
ing what to do to get ourselves 
started and get a win,” Yeguete said. ”It’s a different season now. 
We’re playing for something 
and we know it. I think it helps a lot having four seniors on the team.”
“I think we’re a really good 
group. I think we can do some-thing special.”
With no more suspensions or 
current injuries to worry about, Donovan agreed that his team is poised to make a run as long as his team continues to gel and progress with its cohesiveness.
“The biggest thing for us is that 
we do have a full complement of players that maybe wasn’t the case in November and the be-ginning of December,” Donovan 
said. “Although at certain points 
in time this season (some guys) hadn’t played a lot together, we’re getting back to maybe con-necting and getting a little bit 
deeper as a basketball team and 
getting a little more consistent in the rotation.”  TUESDAY, JANUARY 7, 2014 § ALLIGATOR, 15

2013, in the O’Connell Center. Prather has averaged a team-best 17.3 points per game this season.

The redshirt junior had a solid comeback season 
after suffering two ACL injures in 2012, recording 
26 tackles — including seven for a loss — and a 
team-best four sacks.
“It’s been well documented 
the hardships he has had to over-
come,” Muschamp said, “and he 
has always kept a positive atti-
tude.”
Powell displayed the speed 
and physicality that made him the No. 1 recruit in the 2010 class, according to Rivals.com. He was 
the most highly touted prospect in Rivals’ No. 2 class in the nation — a class headlined by Powell and fellow five-star defenders, Dominique Easley and Sharrif Floyd.
Easley and Powell will join Floyd in the NFL — 
the latter entered the 2013 draft and was selected in the first round by the Minnesota Vikings. Ea-sley, like Powell, announced he would enter the draft after he suffered an ACL injury in Septem-
ber.
“This hasn’t been an easy decision because this 
is a tough place to walk away from,” Powell said 
in a release. “I never thought it would be this hard 
to make this decision.” 
Gators hire coach: While the temperatures in 
Gainesville dropped below freezing, the Gators 
brought Summers to Gainesville. 
Florida filled its last coaching vacancy Monday 
afternoon, announcing that the team hired former Southern California offensive line coach Mike Summers to the same position.Summers takes over for Tim Davis, who was 
fired along with offensive coordinator Brent Pease on Dec. 1.
“I’m excited to have Coach Summers join our 
staff,” Muschamp said in a release. “He has 34 
years of experience, has been an offensive coordi-
nator for 15 years and has coached in the SEC. 
“He has a diverse background and has experi-
ence in the NFL. He will be a great addition to our staff.”
Before Summers joined the USC staff, he 
coached the offensive line at Kentucky under then-head coach and current UF wide receivers coach Joker Phillips. During Summers’ first season, the 
Wildcats averaged 6.1 yards per carry. 
He is the second new hire for Florida who 
coached with Phillips at Kentucky, along with 
UF’s new offensive coordinator, Kurt Roper. Sum-mers also coached at Northern Illinois, Oregon State, Oklahoma State and the NFL’s Atlantica 
Falcons, among other teams. 
Florida’s offensive line struggled throughout 
the season. The Gators averaged 3.6 yards on the 
ground, and the line gave up 27 sacks during the 
season — including four games with four or more 
sacks surrendered.
Summers is the third coach who will make his 
UF debut this season, along with Roper and spe-cial teams coordinator Coleman Hutzler.FootbALL , from page 13

  Gymnastics season has not even start-
ed, but some Gators are already sidelined. 
  Coach Rhonda Faehn conﬁ  rmed two 
injuries for juniors Jamie Shisler and Ki-
ersten Wang on Monday during her ﬁ  rst press conference of the 2014 season. 
  Wang battled a torn groin throughout 
the fall semester, Faehn said. Even though Wang had made strides to heal her inju-ry, she reinjured her groin during Winter Break. 
  “If she does make it back … it would 
be in the March time period, I would esti-mate,” Faehn said. 
  This time frame projects Wang to com-
pete in just two regular-season meets and 
only one meet in the O’Connell Center.
The Gators will feel Wang’s absence. 
  Last season, she racked up season bests of 
9.90 on ﬂ  oor and vault and 9.775 on un-even bars and balance beam. 
She was a key contributor to Florida’s 
title run last year, suiting up for the Gators in all but two meets in 2013. As a fresh-man, Wang also competed in all but two meets.
  Faehn hopes Shisler will have a speed-
ier return and expects her to compete in about a month. 
Last season, the Naples native set a 
career-best vault mark of 9.825 against Ball 
State on Jan. 4, 2013. 
  Faehn said Shisler, who is recovering 
from a foot surgery she underwent in the fall, is back to training.
  “I’m looking right now at the health 
of our team, and it’s very strong,” Faehn 
said. 
“It’s a very long season … we try to bal-ance out the athletes so that they can re-main as healthy as possible and then be as strong as possible toward the latter part of 
the season.”
 While  Shisler and Wang are ailing, 
another Gator is looking to return to the 
ﬂ  oor.
  Sophomore Bridgette Caquatto is fa-
miliar with being out of the lineup before the season even begins. 
In her ﬁ  rst season as a Gator, Caquatto 
was recovering from shoulder and knee 
injuries, as well as multiple stress reactions 
in her shins.  
  “That really kind of put her behind the 
eight ball,” Faehn said.
  She ended up not competing in half 
of the team’s meets last year. However, Faehn expects Caquatto to make up for lost time in 2014.
  “Bridgette Caquatto is doing really re-
ally well so far, and look to see her com-peting a lot,” Faehn said. 
“Now she has had the whole summer 
to train … and has trained really hard all far. 
“She will absolutely be competing in 
three events for us.”  Lingering injuries ail Gators gymnasts
“I’m looking right now at the 
health of our team and it’s very 
strong. It’s a very long season … 
we try to balance out the athletes 
so that they can remain as 
healthy as possible and then be 
as strong as possible toward the 
latter part of the season.”

  Florida’s win against Florida State on 
Saturday was a solid start to the spring sea-
son, but coach Gregg Troy is already look-ing toward the Southeastern Conference and NCAA meets.
  He has been all season.  “We wanted to make sure that we came 
into the season and start the year off very ﬁ  t,” Troy said. “It’s a long season at the end. We’ve got a couple real big dual meets at the end of January. 
“You’ve got a full month between the conference and the NCAA 
meet, and if you haven’t laid a good ground work, it’s very hard to be good at the conference and still come back and be good at the NCAA meet.”
  Florida had just come 
out of a six-week training 
cycle before the Florida 
State meet where Troy  addressed strength 
issues to ensure his swimmers would have the power and endurance they will need come February and March.
  Despite Saturday’s win, he was critical of the men’s work around the walls and said their relay starts were “average at best,” but it wasn’t his biggest worry.
  “The men’s concern is it’s always good to 
be competitive in the SEC,” Troy said. “It’s a great competition, but you don’t what to leave too much in the tank if you lose too much there, and we’ve got 10 guys we feel like are already going to get to the NCAA 
meet. 
  “They’re very focused on that, so there are 
some big goals out there. But we’ve got some 
other ones along the way. Trying to keep all that together at the same time is going to be tough to do.”  Troy called the SEC Championships,  
which are scheduled for mid-February, a “very highly competitive SEC meet.” Florida will face some of the best women’s teams in the country, including No. 2 Texas A&M,  No. 4 Georgia and No. 15 Tennessee
  The Gators women will need to improve 
their depth, which has been a weakness all season. 
But Hilda Luthersdottir has turned a 
weak spot into a strength for the Gators. 
  In September, breaststroke events were 
question marks for Florida. But in January, her 100- and 200-yard breast both rank in the nation’s top 10 times this season.
