CITY COMMISSION VOTED TO 
REINSTATE PRE-PANDEMIC OPEN 
CONTAINER LAW AFTER GPD 
EXPRESSED SAFETY CONCERNS
By Mickenzie Hannon
Alligator Staff Writer
Gainesville residents may no longer be 
allowed to carry alcoholic beverages on 
public property.
City Commissioners voted 4-3 Thursday 
to repeal the open container policy that 
allowed people to drink and carry alcoholic 
beverages in public. The ordinance also 
permitted businesses to serve alcohol in 
public, outdoor spaces. 
Commissioners first voted to allow open 
containers in September 2020, permitting 
struggling businesses to adapt to CDC 
guidelines and survive the pandemic.
Thursday’s decision, which has not 
yet gone into effect and will be revisited 
in coming months, followed Gainesville 
Police Department’s quarterly briefing 
highlighting safety concerns after a recent 
shooting in a downtown parking garage.
Police Chief Lonnie Scott said about 
48% of national homicide cases involved 
alcohol and 
Gainesville’s violence crimes have been 
above projected trend lines since 2020. 
He shared body camera footage of 
fights in Midtown and downtown. The 
parking garage, located at 105 SW 3rd St., 
has become a magnet for large crowds to 
drink and incite violence, he said. 
Laila Fakhoury, a co-owner of How 
Bazar, a vintage retail store located on 
the first floor of the Southwest Downtown 
Garageparking garage, saw the victim of 
the May 1 shooting get pulled out of the 
garage.
“I think that our voices need to be 
heard in terms of open container 
laws, especially because of how they 
affect and impact our businesses,” 
she said.
At the meeting, Fakhoury suggested 
restricting drinking and installing lighting 
and security cameras in the garage.

The search for UF’s next president 
has begun, and graduate students remain 
frustrated they are not represented on the 
Presidential Search committee.
UF students and faculty received an 
email from the university detailing the 
search Tuesday. The Search Advisory 
Committee will host an open forum 
meeting May 10 to discuss questions 
and concerns. Some students are already 
unsatisfied. 
Paul Wassel, president of the Graduate 
Student Council and UF PhD student 
in the genetics and genomic program, 
disagrees with the current structure of 
the committee and was disappointed 
graduate students weren’t represented. 
He wants a student on the panel 
who understands graduate students’ 
experiences. Student Body President 
Lauren Lemasters is the only student on 
the presidential search committee. She 
finished her undergraduate education in 
Spring and has begun pursuing a masters degree this Summer. 
“One student representing 50,000 
students on one of the most important 
searches the university has seen since we 
hired President Fuchs is kind of shocking, 
to be honest,” Wassel said. 
The Presidential Search Committee 
for UF’s 12th president, which resulted 
in President Kent Fuchs’ appointment, 
had similar representation. Christina 
Bonariggo, a former UF student body 
president, represented students on the 
committee. 
Wassel thinks it will be hard for 
Lemasters to provide a graduate student 
perspective with only undergraduate 
experience, he said. 
“I work in a lab, I make a salary, I'm 
paid by the University and I'm not even 
taking classes anymore,” Wassel said. 
“So my priorities are very different than 
an undergraduate student who's living 
on loans maybe and who doesn't have a 
family.”
Other than underrepresentation 
in decision-making bodies at the 
university, graduate students have faced unpaid wages, unsustainable stipends 
and exclusion from decision-making 
concerning graduate housing.   
Bryn Taylor, the communications chair 
for Graduate Students United and a third-
year PhD rehabilitation science student, 
said GAU expressed concerns about 
representation before the presidential 
search committee was chosen.
Graduate students are vital to research, 
she said. The university spent a record 
$960 million in 2021 on research.
Rachel Hartnett, the co-president of 
GSU, sent a letter to the Board of Trustees 
April 18 demanding it appoints a graduate 
student. 
“We deserve a seat at the table,” she 
wrote. 
The university directed GSU to 
voice their concerns during Tuesday’s 
45-minute listening session, Taylor said. 
“We are committed to a process that 
is inclusive and reflects input from across 
the Gator Nation,” Rahul Patel, the chair 
of the Presidential Search Committee, Presidential search continues, graduate students wary

REPAIR UNDERGROUND 
INFRASTRUCTURE ON 
CAMPUS, STUDENTS AND 
FACULTY PREPARE FOR A 
DIFFERENT COMMUTE FOR 
THE NEXT YEAR
By Sandra McDonald
Alligator Staff Writer
For more than eight consecutive 
months, UF roads remain under con -
struction. The latest project closed 
one of the busiest parts of campus. 
On May 2, UF began its next 
phase of on-campus construction, 
leaving parts of Museum Road and 
its intersection with Gale Lemerand 
Drive closed for Summer. The new 
project follows ongoing road clo -
sures scattered throughout campus 
since May 2. 
RTS’s Summer 2022 bus sched -
ule reflects the detours, closed stops 
and added commute time to trips.
The closures and ongoing con -
struction projects leave students 
worried about navigating buses and 
roads to get to class.
For Riley Mixton, a 22-year-old 
UF theater and classics senior, com -
muting to campus is a family affair. 
Mixton, her mother and her sister 
often carpool together.
“I feel very fortunate that I have 
the ability to take a Lyft or to car -
pool with someone,” she said, “But 
for my friends who are parking or 
fully walking on their commute, or 
busing, it’s a nightmare.”
Mixton, who graduates in De -
cember, stopped taking the bus to 
campus when roads closed due to 
construction during the COVID-19 
pandemic. Mixton was also upset 
with a lack of transparency regard -ing the cost and purpose of con -
struction. The official notice from 
UF Business Affairs April 27 said 
roads were closed to allow for un -
derground utility installations. 
“Much of the underground in -
frastructure is over 50 years old and 
this program is a strategic replace -
ment of the aging piping,” AnaLee 
Rodriguez, the Communications 
Manager for UF Business Affairs, 
wrote. 
Mixton will be on campus after 
she graduates to act as an alumna 
advisor. She worries about the proj -
ect going overschedule and imped -
ing the beginning of the Fall semes -
ter. 
“The construction that has been 
finished both inside and outside of 
buildings and on roads, it looks re -
ally good,” she said. “In the end, I 
always seem to like it.”
Dr. Bernard Hauser, a biology 
professor teaching in the Physics 
building off Museum Road this 
Summer, said road closures are nec -
essary for old maxed-out lines to be 
replaced.
Hauser served on the faculty sen -
ate as a member of the infrastructure 
council when it discussed campus 
plans for the next decade in 2016. 
He said the goal was to improve pe -
destrian safety by closing most cam -
pus roads to outside traffic. Hauser 
began riding his bike to campus to 
shorten his commute after the inter -
section in front of the Physics build -
ing closed. 
He said he doesn’t mind that the 
campus will have less traffic; he’s 
almost been hit by cars on its streets.
“By far the most dangerous part 
of the ride is on campus,” he said. 
“Once I get off campus, I’m on bike 
paths all the way. ”Hauser said faculty hasn’t dis -
cussed more lenient attendance 
policies to accommodate for com -
mute times due to construction, but 
he understood students may have 
a harder time getting around. One 
of his students last semester, who 
had to drive to campus because of a 
broken leg, was 30 minutes late to a 
final exam because she kept meeting 
dead ends due to construction.
Prospective freshmen touring 
campus this Spring also saw UF’s 
continuous construction. 
Patty Asman, 51, and her incom -
ing freshman daughter Justine As -
man, 17, were shocked by the scale 
of campus compared to the rest of 
Gainesville. Justine Asman will live 
at Infinity Hall in Fall and the lack 
of student parking drove her to con -
sider riding a moped or the bus to 
campus, rather than having a car. 
RTS officials have not responded 
to media queries as of Sunday eve -
ning about the Summer bus sched -
ule and the construction’s effect on 
drivers. Signs on buses and graphics 
on the RTS website advertise avail -
able bus driver positions. 
For Justine, the construction seen 
during the Gator Days event in early 
April didn’t bother her; instead, it is 
an exciting promise of campus ex -
pansion.

A man died after being shot in a downtown 
Gainesville parking garage early May 1.
Gainesville Police Department responded 
to a call after shots were fired May 1 at 105 
SW 3rd St., near How Bazar and High Dive, 
around 2 a.m., according to a press release. 
GPD is interviewing people to identify and 
arrest the shooter. 
As of Sunday afternoon, no arrests have 
been made.
The shooting stemmed from an argument 
between two groups in the garage, according 
to the release. The victim, who was involved 
in the argument, was hit by gunfire.
A bystander was helping the victim when 
officers arrived on the second floor of the 
garage. Officers began performing first aid 
before EMS arrived, according to the release. 
The victim was declared dead at UF Shands 
Hospital. 
This was the second homicide in Gainesville 
this year, Glover said. 
Gainesville will be increasing its nighttime security patrol in the garage on Thursdays 
through Sundays from 7 p.m. to 5 a.m., 
according to the Interim City Manager Cynthia 
Curry. The city will also be improving the 
camera and lighting systems in the garage. 
Access to the garage will now be limited 
on Thursdays through Sundays from 10 p.m. 
to 5 a.m. The garage entryway on SW 2nd 
St. will not be open during those times and 
the entryway on SW 3rd St. will be closed 
to all except those who have parking garage 
permits. In her statement, Curry said — with 
the exception of these times — those with 
parking permits for the garage will still have 
24/7 access from both streets. 
Glover said GPD interviewed others who 
were on the scene and urges anyone who has 
information regarding the shooting to contact 
352-393-7719. For anonymity, contact Crime 
Stoppers at 352-377-4141.
This is a developing story.

Gainesville to take advantage of the 
open container policy and it leads to 
violence. Commissioner Harvey Ward 
added the violence was occurring 
before the council allowed open 
containers.
Some public commenters disagreed 
on the initial purpose of the open 
container policy. Sharon Burney, 57, 
said the city allowed public drinking 
to accommodate football games and 
game days’ influx of drunk fans.
After GPD’s presentation and the 
public comments, the council voted 
to restrict the open containers; Mayor 
Lauren Poe and Commissioners 
Adrian Hayes-Santos and David 
Arreola dissented. 
The council also voted 4-3 to allow 
businesses to request permits to serve 
alcohol in public areas. Hayes-Santos, 
Arreola and Chestnut dissented.
Jacob Larson, the owner of The Bull 
— a downtown bar a block away from 
the parking garage — said about 85% 
of his sales come from the outdoor 
section. Changing that business model 
would be a big pivot, he said.
“We’ve adjusted a lot of our 
practices on how we do business based on that ability for the extension 
of premises,” he said.
Anthony Rue has owned Volta 
Coffee — located on the first floor 
of the downtown parking garage — 
for 14 years. He said violence has 
progressively worsened since open 
containers were permitted.
Every weekend, Rue and other 
local business owners clean the mess 
surrounding the parking garage.
“It was like cleaning up a toxic 
waste zone,” Rue said. He’s 
swept firearm shell casings, used 
condoms, clothing and bloody 
jewelry outside his business 
after large parties in the garage.
“You guys are my landlords,” 
he told the council during public 
comment. “And you should be looking 
out after me.”
Gainesville Director of 
Transportation Malisa McCreedy 
announced the parking garage will 
remain closed 10 p.m. through 5 a.m. 
Thursday through Sunday and have 
more security personnel.

IN RESPONSE TO A DRAFT LEAK 
FROM THE SUPREME COURT, 
PLANNED PARENTHOOD ORGANIZED 
A PROTEST TUESDAY EVENING
By Namari Lock
Alligator Staff Writer
More than 100 protesters pooled outside 
a Gainesville courthouse Tuesday evening to 
rally for abortion rights after reports that Roe 
v. Wade will be overturned.
Julia Braver, a 19-year-old UF political 
science junior, stood among them, raising a 
sign that read “Abortion is Healthcare.”
Callback chants, like “When I say 
abortion, you say justice,” could be heard in 
the background as the crowd, including City 
Commissioner David Arreola and County 
Commissioner Anna Prizzia, grew. 
Planned Parenthood of South, East and 
North Florida organized the protest outside 
Judge Stephan P. Mickle, Sr. Criminal 
Courthouse. It started at 5 p.m. Tuesday, one 
day after Politico published an article including 
a leaked draft ruling that would overturn 
Roe v. Wade, a 1973 U.S. Supreme Court 
decision protecting women’s rights to privacy 
and abortions without excessive government 
restriction. 
“I don’t think that my protesting, or any of 
the protesting right now, will stop the Supreme 
Court from actually passing the ruling that will 
overturn Roe v. Wade,” Braver said. “But I do 
think it’s important to make my voice heard 
and make all our opinions known.” 
Braver said she thinks the Supreme Court 
and U.S. leaders should account for the 
majority of Americans who support Roe v. 
Wade and abortion access.Though the draft is devastating, it will not 
immediately impact Florida, Kai Christmas, 
Planned Parenthood’s regional organizer, 
said. The only law affecting Florida is the 15-
week ban that will be put into effect July 1, 
Christmas said. 
Other states have laws in place that would 
ban or restrict abortion as soon as Roe v. Wade 
falls. Christmas calls these trigger laws.
“It will be a state-by-state fight,” Christmas 
said. “In Florida … we know it’s going to be 
a big fight because a tax on our reproductive 
rights has been ever-present.”
Mark Harrington, president of the anti-
abortion organization Created Equal, said though the overturn is expected to pass, it is 
not official until the vote is made.
Unless one of the majority justices change 
their vote, anti-abortion organizations will get 
the ruling they’ve wanted for over 50 years, 
Harrington said. 
Harrington said Americans should have 
expected this decision for well over a year 
now. Several states have already pushed to 
severely restrict or ban abortions. 
“I expect a lot of protests in the next several 
days and when the decision is handed down 
in June, but after that, people will settle in and 
we’ll go about living in a post-Roe America,” 
he said.One protester, John Nunes, was concerned 
the Supreme Court will continue reversing 
previous court decisions, such as same-
sex marriage and rulings against racial 
discrimation.
“They are not playing by our rules,” he 
said. “They’re not playing by the rules 
they’ve told us they’re playing by.”
Rep. Yvonne Hayes Hinson, who represents 
parts of Alachua County in the Florida House 
of Representatives, wrote in an email that 
though she never hopes for these decisions, 
they are no surprise. 
Hinson said women should not be burdened 
with consequences of sexual assault, abuse, 
date rape and incest.
“Poll after poll and year after year, voters 
have been clear; they overwhelmingly support 
reproductive freedom and Roe v. Wade,” she 
wrote. 
Gainesville will see the decision’s impact on 
women in poverty and women of color, and 
the best way to prevent these outcomes is by 
voting, she wrote. 
While Christmas thought the draft decison 
was unprecedented, she wasn’t shocked by 
it; the right to safe, legal abortions has been 
under attack since 1973.
Final opinions have yet to be released and 
are not expected to be published until late 
June. Gainesville’s local Planned Parenthood 
is organizing a march for the cause May 14, 
Christmas said.
“This is just the beginning of what will be a 
long fight this summer,” Christmas said.

PLANNED PARENTHOOD 
ORGANIZÓ UNA PROTESTA 
EL MARTES POR LA NOCHE 
EN RESPUESTA A UN 
DOCUMENTO FILTRADO 
DE LA CORTE SUPREMA
Escrito por Namari Lock

Más de 100 manifestantes se 
reunieron frente a un tribunal de 
Gainesville el martes por la noche 
para protestar por el derecho al abor -
to tras la filtración de un documento 
que sugiere que Roe contra Wade 
será revocado.
Julia Braver, una estudiante de 
segundo año de ciencias políticas en 
UF y a la edad de 19, se encontraba 
en la manifestación alzando un car -
tel que decía “Abortion is Health -
care” (El aborto protege la salud).
Cánticos como “Cuando yo diga 
aborto, tu dices justicia” se podían 
escuchar de fondo a medida que 
crecía la multitud, de la cual forma -
ban parte el comisionado de la ciu -
dad David Arreola y la comisionada 
del condado Anna Prizzia.
La protesta fue organizada por 
Planned Parenthood del sur, este 
y norte de la Florida. Esta se llevó 
a cabo frente al Judge Stephen P. 
Mickle, Sr. Criminal Courthouse 
y comenzó a las 5 p.m. del mar -tes, un día después de que Politico 
publicara un artículo que incluía el 
documento filtrado que anularía 
Roe contra Wade, ley firmada por la 
Corte Suprema en 1973 protegiendo 
los derechos de las mujeres a la pri -
vacidad y al aborto sin restricciones 
gubernamentales excesivas.
“No creo que mi protesta ni cu -
alquiera de las protestas en este mo -
mento impidan que la Corte Supre -
ma apruebe el fallo que anulará Roe 
contra Wade”, dijo Braver. “Pero si 
creo que es importante alzar mi voz 
y dar a conocer nuestras opiniones”.
Braver agregó que cree que la 
Corte Suprema y los líderes del 
país deberían tener en cuenta que 
la mayoría de los estadounidenses 
apoyan Roe contra Wade y el acceso 
al aborto.
Kai Christmas, quien trabaja jun -
to a Planned Parenthood, comentó 
que aunque el projecto de ley es 
desvastador, no tendrá un impacto 
inmediato en Florida. La única ley 
que afecta a Florida es la prohibición 
de 15 semanas que entrará en vigor 
el 1 de julio.
Otros estados tienen leyes vigen -
tes que prohibirían o restringirían el 
aborto tan pronto como se anule Roe 
contra Wade, las cuales Christmas 
llama leyes de activación.
“Será una lucha de estado por 
estado”, dijo Christmas. “En Flori -
da, sabemos que va a ser una gran 
pelea porque siempre ha estado pre -
sente un impuesto sobre nuestros 
derechos reproductivos”.Mark Harrington, presidente de 
la organización antiaborto Created 
Equal, dijo que aunque se espera 
que se apruebe la revocación, esta 
no será oficial hasta que se realice 
una votación.
A menos que uno de los jueces 
de la mayoría cambie su voto, las or -
ganizaciones contra el aborto obten -
drán el fallo que han querido duran -
te más de 50 años, dijo Harrington.
Harrington agregó que los es -
tadounidenses debían haberse esper -
ado esta decisión desde hace más de 
un año debido a que varios estados 
ya han presionado para restringir 
severamente o prohibir los abortos.
“Espero muchas protestas en los 
próximos días y cuando se dicte la 
decisión en junio pero después de 
eso la gente se acostumbrará y vivi -
remos en una América post Roe”.
A John Nunes, uno de los mani -
festantes, le preocupaba que la Corte 
Suprema continué revocando deci -
siones judiciales como el matrimo -
nio entre personas del mismo sexo y 
fallos contra la discriminación racial.
“No están jugando guíandose 
por nuestras reglas”, dijo 
Nunes. “No están jugando 
guíandose por las reglas que 
dijeron usar” .
Yvonne Hayes Hinson, quien 
representa partes del condado de 
Alachua en la Cámara de Represent -
antes de Florida, escribió un correo 
electrónico afirmando que aunque nunca esperó estas decisiones, no le 
sorprenden.
Hinson agregó que las mujeres 
no deberían cargar con las conse -
cuencias de la agresión sexual, el 
abuso, la violación y el incesto.
“Encuesta tras encuesta y año 
tras año, los votantes han sido 
claros; apoyan abrumadoramente la 
libertad reproductiva y a Roe contra 
Wade”, la representante comentó.
Gainesville verá el impacto de 
la decisión en las mujeres en situ -
ación de pobreza y en las mujeres 
de color, y la mejor manera de evitar 
estos resultados es votando, escribió 
Hinson.Aunque Christmas pensó que el 
documento filtrado no tenía prec -
edentes, tampoco se sorprendió; el 
derecho al aborto seguro y legal ha 
sido amenazado desde 1973.
Las opiniones finales aún no se 
han publicado y no se espera que 
se publiquen hasta finales de junio. 
La sede de Planned Parenthood en 
Gainesville está organizando una 
marcha por la causa el 14 de mayo.
“Este es solo el comienzo de lo 
que será una larga batalla este ve -
rano”, dijo Christmas.

Joni Messler pirouetted 
through life. 
From New York to Paris 
to London, she trained as a 
professional ballerina before 
settling down in Gainesville as 
a ballet instructor in 1959. Her 
memory lives on with the students she taught for over 50 years.
“She was a big part of the 
lives of many dance students 
that come through her 
doors,” Messler’s friend 
Mimi Gray said.
On April 15, Messler died of 
natural causes — she was 85 years 
old. She was known for creating the ballet “The Little Match Girl,” 
which was performed around 
Christmastime for 33 years at the 
Phillips Center for the Performing 
Arts.
The story centered around a 
poor girl on the street who had 
to sell matches to survive. After 
having sweet visions, she even -
tually freezes to death, but Gray 
said Messler decided to alter the ending for her ballet so the match 
girl would see her grandma in a 
dream. 
The ballet featured both novice 
community members and refined 
dancers from Messler’s studio. 
Thea Miller, a 21-year-old UF 
English major, said she went to 
the Joni Messler Studio of Dance 
for 11 years. 
“She had a very strong per -
sonality,” Miller said. “She was 
very funny a lot of times and very 
charismatic.” 
While Messler took dancing 
seriously, she still wanted to have 
fun with what she taught, Miller 
said.  
“She would like to goof around 
and that would show in some of 
her choreography,” Miller said. 
Messler would occasionally 
have dancers stumble on pur -
pose for comedy ballets or make 
funny faces or giggle — especially 
if the recital featured a handsome 
prince. 
During Miller’s junior year 
of high school, when Messler 
stopped running her dance studio 
at age 83, she would have former 
students over to hang out and 
talk. 
”We were kind of like soror -
ity sisters, which is really nice,” 
Miller said.
Miller said Messler played a 
crucial role in her life, and with -
out her, she wouldn’t be as in -
terested in performing and being 
creative as she is now. Seeing 
Messler create her ballet and its 
success helped inspire Miller to 
want to follow her dreams in film 
writing. 
Messler’s nickname, “Miss 
Joni,” came from a classical bal -
let tradition, Jodie Gray said. She 
said any female ballet teacher, 
regardless of marital status, was 
referred to as “Miss.” 
Jodie Gray said the nickname 
carried over when non-dancers 
began to call her “Miss Joni” as 
well.
“There really was a spectrum 
for anybody who could be in -
volved,” Jodie Gray said. “I know 
that meant a lot to Miss Joni — 
she enjoyed teaching.” 
Jodie Gray’s mother, Mimi 
Gray, was a former ballet teacher 
at Joni Messler Studio of Dance 
for 20 years. 
“She loved working with 
young people,” Mimi Gray said. 
“She loved teaching dance, and 
she knew so much about it.” 
Mimi Gray said one of her 
fondest memories of Messler was when Jodie Gray got to be one 
of the ballerinas in the opening 
number of Messler’s recital, “Go 
to Dreamland.” 
She thought her daughter was 
going to get kicked from the num -
ber because she had a tap dance 
right after it.
“I thought — this is terrible; 
she can't go back-to-back,” Mimi 
Gray said. “That's just impos -
sible.”
But Messler added a brief 
pause to let Jodie Gray change 
into her tap costume and shoes, 
Mimi Gray said. 
“[Miss Joni] came walking 
up to me, and I just thought, 
‘Oh no,’” Mimi Gray said. “She 
looked at me, and she said, ‘We 
will wait for you,’ and that just 
meant so much to me. I’ll just 
never forget it.” 
Messler’s niece, Dawn Bishop, 
said she will remember Messler 
as a mentor and best friend. 
Messler’s marriage gave her the 
best idea of what a relationship 
should look like: Messler  stepped 
down from teaching dance to help 
take care of her sick husband be -
fore he died in 2021. 
Messler’s compassion trans -
ferred to the studio. Bishop said 
she was a coach who could be 
constructive while always giving 
praise to build confidence.
“That was important because 
everybody’s got something great 
about them, and she would find 
that and let them know,” Bishop 
said.

wrote in an email.
The search committee requires that 
there be one student on the committee, 
and Lemasters represents the interests of 
all students including graduate students, 
Patel wrote. 
Patel noted that Nicole Stedman, the 
Dean of the Graduate School, spoke at the 
last board of trustees meeting and said that 
the graduate student perspective would be 
represented in the search process. 
The purpose of the listening session is to allow students and faculty to comment on 
the qualifications and personal attributes 
the university is looking for in its next 
president, Patel wrote. 
Depending on that input, the board of 
trustees will prepare a position profile and 
recruiting materials. The listening sessions 
will be an important part of that process, 
Patel wrote.
“Forty-five minutes isn't really enough 
for 16,000 graduate students,” Taylor said.   
GSU wants the university’s next 
president to be interested in open 
communication about the administration’s 
goals and decisions.Presidential candidates’ identities 
will be kept out of public records for the 
majority of the search. Senate Bill 520 and 
House Bill 703 shield students and faculty 
from meeting with finalists until 21 days 
before the next president is chosen. 
For now, both Taylor and Wassel 
encourage students to attend upcoming 
listening sessions to voice concerns.
Xavia Arthur, a 19-year-old English 
sophomore, said it’s important for the 
future president to have values that take 
more than one group of students into 
account.
As a Black woman, Arthur wants a president who will make her and other 
minority students be seen and heard. 
“It’s important to me that the president 
has in mind the needs of everyone … 
UF has been looking into more diversity 
overall,” she said. 
Significant progress happens at 
leadership positions, so it’s important 
for the president to value the voices of a 
diverse group of students, Arthur said. 
The Search Advisory Committee 
meeting will take place on Tuesday at 9:30 
a.m. via Zoom.

GAINESVILLE’S PREMIERE 
NOCTURNAL FOOD OPTIONS  
By Amanda Friedman
Avenue Staff Writer
When 22-year-old UF computer 
science graduate Nicholas Verdugo 
exits a Gainesville bar at 1 a.m., all 
he can think about is which restau -
rant he’ll go to next to satisfy his late-
night cravings. 
Like many college students, Ver -
dugo enjoys a midnight snack after 
a night out with friends, and he’s 
become a regular at a few late-night 
spots around Gainesville. His favor -
ite is Flaco’s Cuban Bakery.
“The food is always delicious,” 
Verdugo said. “I specifically like 
going at night because there are so 
many people there having a good 
time. The energy is very high.”
A combination of newly opened 
restaurants and long-time staples 
represent the late-night food restau -
rants in Gainesville. Some highlights 
include Insomnia Cookies, Naq’s Ha -
lal Food and Flaco’s Cuban Bakery.
Flaco’s Cuban Bakery
This laid back Cuban bakery by day transforms into a must-visit 
munchies destination and entertain -
ment hub once the sun goes down, 
staying open until 2:30 a.m. Tuesday 
through Saturday.
Located at 200 W. Univer -
sity Ave., the family-run business 
opened 16 years ago when co-owner 
Sara Puyana moved to Gainesville 
from Miami. Jill Kubisck, the restau -
rant’s manager, said Puyana aspires 
to bring her Hispanic heritage to the 
local culinary scene.
During the pandemic, Puyana 
also opened Vecinos — the connect -
ing bar next door — to attract more 
customers through curating late-
night events like drag shows, com -
edy shows and karaoke nights.
Flaco’s is always packed with 
people enjoying their food and danc -
ing to music during the late-night 
hours, Kubisck said.
“It’s hundreds of people coming 
through,” Kubisck said. “We have a 
line out the door.”
A customer favorite is The Gator 
Cuban, a sandwich with pork, mayo, 
mustard, pickles and swiss pressed 
between Cuban bread. Another 
popular menu item is the quesito, a 
cream cheese-filled pastry dubbed 
by staff as the “sexy pastry” due to its popularity.
“It’s a pretty fun vibe,” Kubisck 
said. “It’s like you’re still partying.”
Insomnia Cookies
Insomnia Cookies has quickly 
become a busy Gainesville go-to for 
late-night desserts since it opened in 
March 2021. The store is open from 
noon to 1 a.m. Sunday, 11 a.m. to 
1 a.m. Monday through Wednes -
day, and noon to 3 a.m. Thursday 
through Saturday.
Located at 1702 W. University 
Ave., the chain’s eighth Florida lo -
cation offers a selection of freshly 
baked cookies, which can be paired 
with different ice cream flavors or 
frosting. 
General manager Brett Nelson has 
worked at the store since its grand 
opening, and he said he enjoys mak -
ing his customers smile with the help 
of cookies and his positive attitude. 
Insomnia Cookies’ late-night 
crowd ranges from students cram -
ming for exams, people leaving the 
surrounding Midtown bars and cou -
ples on a date night, he said.
“We are here for everybody,” 
Nelson said. “You get people who’ve 
had really, really bad days, and all 
that might make it better is just a warm, delicious cookie.”
Naq’s Halal Food
Naq’s Halal Food opened a 
Gainesville location in April 2021 
and has since brought New York-
style halal food to local hungry cus -
tomers. 
The restaurant, located at 1412 
W. University Ave., serves a vari -
ety of different foods like gyros, rice 
platters, salads and sandwiches. It is 
open from 11 a.m. to midnight Sun -
day through Thursday and 11 a.m. to 3 a.m. Friday and Saturday; sum -
mer hours may vary. In the religion 
of Islam, the Halal diet should be fol -
lowed according to the Quran. Most 
foods are inherently Halal, but halal 
meat must be prepared in a specific 
way.

THE PROPOSAL WILL RECONSTRUCT 
CITIZENS FIELD, EXPAND MLK 
CENTER ON EIGHTH AVENUE AND 
WALDO ROAD
By Carissa Allen
Alligator Staff Writer
A proposed sports complex in East 
Gainesville has reignited a fiery decades-long 
political debate on how to spur economic 
activity in the area.
City Commissioner Cynthia Chestnut 
sees the quadrant at Eighth Avenue and 
Waldo Road as a blank slate begging 
to be commercialized. She envisions a 
multimillion-dollar sports complex resting in 
the heart of East Gainesville. 
Some residents are not sold. 
Faye Williams, a 67-year-old Porters 
Community activist, said Waldo Road is not 
the best location for this project. 
“The sports center? Great,” she said. “But 
the priority should always be on housing. 
We don’t have enough housing.”
Chestnut’s proposal involves 
reconstructing Citizens Field, where 
Gainesville’s first high school football games 
were played in 1948. It would also add 
square footage to the Martin Luther King Jr. 
Multipurpose Center. 
She said the city and county would 
benefit from providing a community hub 
for neighbors and providing economic 
revitalization for Gainesville’s underserved 
community.“East Gainesville deserves the 
attention and investment of this 
initiative,” Chestnut added.
She wants to expand and improve Citizens 
Field by installing new bleachers, a new 
track, locker rooms, ticket booths, digital 
scoreboards, a press box and a concession 
stand. 
In the MLK Center, Chestnut plans for 
two high school basketball courts, new-
and-improved facilities for group fitness 
classes, community meeting rooms, a senior 
programming wing, an activities wing and an 
auditorium. She also suggested connecting 
the Dwight H. Hunter Pool to the center.
The sports complex would be open for 
recreational use on weekdays and host 
tournaments on weekends.
Chestnut wants to involve East Gainesville 
residents in the planning process, but some 
neighbors expressed uneasiness with the 
proposal. 
“Where’s the feasibility study?” Sharon 
Bauer, a 73-year-old East Gainesville 
resident, asked.
Bauer is confused why the city would 
spend millions of dollars on a sports complex 
instead of redeveloping the east side of 
Waldo Road to support existing businesses 
and new housing.
She believes Chestnut is oblivious to her 
interests and the interests of East Gainesville 
residents.
“She’s taking a dagger and stabbing me 
and my neighbors in the back,” Bauer said.For years, Bauer and her neighbors 
requested minor renovations to Citizens Field 
and the MLK Center, including installing 
new bleachers and repairing a leaky roof. A 
multimillion-dollar sports facility is not what 
they had in mind.
“Why do they need consultants? Why will 
they not listen to the neighbors?” she asked. 
“Listen to us. Listen to us about what we 
want at that park.”
As District 1’s representative, 
Commissioner Desmon Duncan-Walker was enthused about the idea of bringing sports 
tourism to Gainesville and understands the 
renovations that Citizens Field requires, but 
she was concerned about the location of 
the complex. Traffic dynamics and impacts 
to surrounding neighborhoods must be 
analyzed before plans progress, she said.
“The question then becomes, do we 
actually modify what’s already there?” 
Duncan-Walker asked. “Do we erase it 
entirely and build something new?”
Since the meeting, she said she has heard 
a mixed bag of reactions to the proposal but 
wants to hear from more of her constituency.
Despite the unknowns, other East 
Gainesville residents think the sports complex 
would stimulate economic prosperity.
Tyra Edwards, a 52-year-old East 
Gainesville community activist known as Ty 
Loudd, believes it will create jobs, business 
opportunities and tax revenue in the area. 
She said the proposal is about equity with 
the west side of the city, though Chestnut 
was clear this sports complex will not 
compete with the facility being constructed 
in Celebration Pointe.
Edwards has anticipated development on 
the Waldo Road corridor for years. She said 
Chestnut finally stepped up to the plate.
Chestnut recommended city staff hire a 
consultant to explore the scope and cost of 
the project, but commissioners remain wary 
about acting too hastily. They will vote on 
the proposal May 19.

The new Alachua County 
Sports Event Center is one beam 
closer to opening its structure with 
an NCAA-approved indoor track 
and tennis, basketball and volley -
ball courts. 
The county hosted a topping 
off ceremony Friday to honor the 
installment of the final steel beam 
of the structure. The $38 million 
center, set to open early 2023, 
reached its halfway checkpoint. 
The building, spanning more than the length of two football 
fields, is located next to 5001 Cel -
ebration Pointe Ave. It’s estimated 
to bring in about $77 million per 
year to the county, according to an 
Alachua County press release.
“I’m hoping that this is going 
to serve as a model going forward 
that we can combine our resourc -
es and that we can see more big 
projects like this so that we can all 
grow together and  everyone can 
experience the success that we 
know is going to happen in this 
place,” County Commission Chair 
Marihelen Wheeler said.The final beam became a time 
capsule for generations to come 
after the community was invited 
to sign it. At least 50 people came 
up, about 10 at a time, and chat -
ted as they covered the steel with 
optimistic messages toward the 
project’s future.
One message read, “It’s been a 
journey — what a great project!” 
Another wrote, “What’s good 
Gainesville Alachua County!”
The sports center is projected 
to create more than 1,000 jobs 
with about $26 million in yearly 
wages, Alachua County Manager 
Michele Lieberman said. It will 
also bring in an estimated $12 mil -
lion in hotel bookings and gener -
ate more than $1 million in sales 
tax each year.
The 23 hotels and dozens of 
restaurants in a three-mile radius 
of Celebration Pointe heavily in -
fluenced the sports center’s loca -
tion, Florida Senator Keith Perry 
said.
“You have to have facilities 
where you can get something to 
eat; you have to have facilities that 
you can go stay at,” Perry said. 
“This is just a dynamic place.”
Perry said his family traveled 
southeast America for his daugh -
ters’ club volleyball tournaments, 
sometimes going even further to 
Dallas, Los Angeles and Puerto 
Rico. Gainesville’s center, he said, 
will be better than any establish -
ment they have visited.
“This will be a facility that will 
compete with any facility any -
where,” Perry said.The county’s Tourist Develop -
ment Tax supplied $30 million to 
the project, the press release said. 
A majority of the revenue comes 
from hotels and Airbnbs in the 
area, County Communications Di -
rector Mark Sexton said. 
The county has recovered since 
the pandemic and is experiencing 
one of its best financial years, Sex -
ton said. The Tourist Development 
Tax is bringing in a new record of 
about $6 million a year, Sexton 
said.
Alachua County Commission -
er Ken Cornell said they learned “folks don’t skimp on their kids” 
when it comes to budgeting ex -
pendable income. He said people 
were still driving hundreds of 
miles to take their kids to events 
during the pandemic, and he ex -
pects the facility to attract 1,000 
people every weekend.
Cornell said the center is ex -
pected to spur an additional $80 
million in commercial develop -
ment around Celebration Pointe.

By Brenda Bogle
Sports Writer
Gators men’s and women’s tennis domi -
nated singles and doubles play this weekend, 
sending both title-contending teams to the 
NCAA Super Regionals beginning May 13.
Florida men’s tennis (25-2, 12-0) notched 
its sixth straight Round of 16 appearance at 
the Alfred A. Ring Tennis Complex, while the 
women’s side (21-6, 10-3) earned its first re -
turn to the the third round of NCAA tourna -
ment since 2017.
Saturday saw the reigning men’s national 
champions eliminate Miami, 4-0. 
The No. 2 seed in the tournament claimed 
its 20th straight doubles point, highlighted by 
senior Sam Riffice and sophomore Ben Shel -
ton, who defeated fourth-year juniors Franco 
Aubone and Juan Martin Jalif, 6-3.Florida sealed the win and generated fiery 
rounds of tennis in singles.
Riffice clinched the Gators' first singles 
point of the day against Bojan Jankulovski, 
6-3, 6-0. The veteran improved to 21-5 in dual 
matches this year.
Senior Duarte Vale defeated fifth-year Ben -
jamin Hannestad, 6-3, 6-3, and senior Josh 
Goodger overpowered freshman Casper Chris -
tensen, 6-4, 6-4 to end the Canes’ season. 
Vale spoke about the team's focus and 
preparation as Florida looks to advance in the 
tournament.
“I think we have expectations about how 
we should be,” Vale said. “Our focus has 
to be on the things that we can control.”
Sunday, the women’s team took center 
court and claimed its third victory over Florida State this season. The No.16-seed Gators were 
looking to rebound from a lackluster first-round 
doubles performance against South Alabama.
Senior Marlee Zein and freshman Bente 
Spee won the Gators’ first doubles match of 
the day, defeating Florida State junior Victoria 
Allen and senior Kianah Motosono, 6-0.
Head coach Roland Thornqvist said he was 
pleased with his players — especially Zein and 
Spee — because they took it upon themselves 
to come out strong in doubles play.
“They responded like we expect all our 
athletes to do,” Thornqvist said. “If you play 
poorly, you address the things that you didn't 
do well, and obviously they were determined 
to do different today.”
Moments after Zein and Spee completed 
their match, graduate student McCartney Kes -
sler and freshman Alicia Dudeney clinched the 
opening point by defeating FSU redshirt senior Petra Hule and sophomore Anna Arkadianou, 
6-3.
UF needing three singles points to come out 
on top; they scored early with a sharp attack 
from Dudeney.
She rallied to defeat Allen after falling be -
hind in the first set, 3-6, 6-0, 6-0. Junior Emma 
Shelton, unlike Dudeney, struggled to find her 
rhythm against Motosono and fell 7-5, 6-1. 
Zein put up a momentous performance 
against Arkadianou, winning 6-3, 6-3. Sopho -
more Sara Dahlstrom clinched the match with 
a 6-1, 6-4 victory over Florida State redshirt 
senior Lesedi Jacobs. The Gators came out on 
top, 4-1.
With both teams advancing to the NCAA 
Super Regionals off such imposing perfor -
mances, Florida’s chances of capturing a men’s 
and women’s title in the same season are very 
much alive.

THE GATORS BASEBALL TEAM 
SNAGGED ITS FIRST SWEEP IN 
MORE THAN TWO MONTHS 
AFTER DEFEATING MISSISSIPPI 
STATE 6-2 SUNDAY
By Jackson Castellano
Sports Writer
The Gators baseball team snagged 
its first sweep in more than two 
months after defeating Mississippi 
State 6-2 Sunday. 
Head coach Kevin O’Sullivan and 
his group encountered blown leads 
and games trapped in deadlocks 
throughout their trip to Starkville, 
Mississippi, but unlike the season’s 
tough early losses, the Gators (29-
18, 11-13) battled back to win each 
matchup over the Bulldogs (25-23, 
9-15). 
Florida began the weekend 
with seven unanswered runs in 
the opening game Friday. After the 
‘Dawgs came back in the late stages 
of the matchup, freshman pitcher 
Ryan Slater forced a groundout for 
the save and an 8-6 victory. 
UF stood even with MSU until a 
six-run offensive explosion in the 
ninth propelled the Gators toward a 
series-clinching victory Saturday. 
The series finale Sunday came 
down to heroics from sophomore 
second baseman Sterlin Thompson in 
the final two innings.Mississippi State opened the 
scoring with an RBI single in the 
bottom of the first. Sophomore 
infielder Josh Rivera evened the 
game, bringing freshman designated 
hitter Jac Caglianone home on a 
groundout in the second inning. 
A scoring drought ensued, each 
team suffering three-up-three-down 
innings. 
Both teams found ways to get on 
base but struggled to convert runners 
into runs. UF and MSU combined for 
a .220 batting average and left ten 
runners stranded through the first 
seven innings.
At the top of the eighth, both 
dugouts were squirmish, awaiting a 
break in the stalemate. Thompson 
stepped to the plate for the Gators. 
He hit the first pitch foul before 
taking a ball, a strike and tipping 
another ball out of play. On the fifth 
pitch, Thompson squared up and 
drove the ball beyond the right field 
wall to give the Gators a one-run lead.
Florida entered the final inning 
with a series sweep in sight; MSU 
went scoreless in the eighth, setting 
up a pivotal ninth. 
The Gators added four runs to 
their lead via two back-to-back RBI 
hits from Rivera and Thompson, 
securing the win and dampening the 
home crowd’s cheers.
Gators freshman righty Jameson 
Fisher earned his first win of his 
collegiate career. The Palm Beach County, Florida, native threw two 
strikeouts and earned a 2.57 ERA to 
close out the final four innings. 
Florida has a home rematch 
against Bethune-Cookman (20-26, 14-9) Tuesday at Condron Ballpark. 
The Gators took a 3-2 victory in the 
last contest between the two teams. 
From there, UF travels to Columbia, 
Missouri, for a weekend series against Mizzou (25-19, 7-16)
First pitch Tuesday is set for 6:30 
p.m. The game will be streamed on 
SECNetwork+.

The Gators lacrosse team 
headed home with some hardware 
and a bid to the NCAA Tournament 
after beating the Vanderbilt 
Commodores (11-7, 3-2) 18-7 at 
Johnson Stadium in Greenville, 
North Carolina, Saturday.
Led by head coach Amanda 
O’Leary, No. 8 Florida (15-4, 5-0) 
took home the American Athletic 
Conference Tournament crown. 
The result marked eight consecutive 
conference tournament titles for 
the orange and blue, the last three 
of which came in the AAC. 
It was a back-and-forth affair 
to start. Vanderbilt opened the 
scoring, finding the back of the net 
just over a minute into play. Both 
teams traded goals until the score 
was knotted at three apiece with 
just under three minutes left in the 
opening quarter.
Florida’s defense solidified 
quickly. Led by redshirt sophomore 
Sarah Reznick, Florida’s defense 
held the opposition to 7-of-20 
shooting for the game. The two-
time AAC Goalkeeper of the Year managed to record nine saves. 
In the second quarter, Florida’s 
offensive and defensive attack 
continued to move in sync. UF 
kept the Commodores scoreless 
while scoring four goals. Junior 
midfielder Shelton Sawers fired 
one directly in front of the cage 
to give UF a 8-3 lead heading into 
halftime.
O’Leary said the energy and 
effort the Gators displayed not 
just in the tournament final, but 
throughout the season, gave the 
team a necessary boost heading 
into the NCAA competition. 
Along with an undefeated 
conference record, Florida has won 
the regular season and tournament 
crown nine of the last 13 seasons.
The Gators’ added on to 
their regular-season conference 
accolades with postseason awards. 
Seven Florida players were 
selected for the All-Tournament 
Team: Maggie Hall, Emily Heller, 
Emma Lopinto, Danielle Pavinelli, 
Catherine Moriarty, Ashley 
Gonzalez and Reznick.
Pavinelli added the Most 
Outstanding Player award to her 
resume Saturday, leading the Gators with six goals in their win 
over Vanderbilt. 
It was also a career afternoon 
for junior Heller, who scored four 
goals with one assist. She slipped 
past Vandy’s goalkeeper Paige 
Gunning with seconds remaining 
in the first quarter, making the 
most of a free-position opportunity 
and giving the Gators a one-point 
edge. 
Sophomore attacker Hall 
continued her recent offensive 
surge, converting on a feed from 
Heller. 
“All the credit to Vanderbilt,” 
O’Leary said. “They played 
us tough after their emotional 
semifinal win, and their goalie 
had a tremendous showing in 
the cage.”
Coming off a 13-game winning 
streak, Florida will face Mercer 
in the first round of the NCAA 
tournament as the seventh overall 
seed on May 13.
