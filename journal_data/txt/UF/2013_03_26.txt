Former U.S. Representative,  
presidential candidate and physician Ron 
Paul will speak at UF on April 15.
During his three-decade political career, 
Paul ran for president three separate times, most recently in 2012. Paul’s son, Rand Paul, headed a nearly 13-hour ﬁ  libuster 
earlier this month.
Hosted by Accent Speaker’s Bureau, Paul will speak at the Stephen C. O’Connell 
Center on Tax Day.
“It was just a coincidence that he 
happened to be available on Tax Day,” 
said Accent chairman Josh Holtzman. 
“This certainly enhances the event 
because so much of what he talks about 
has to deal with taxing and economic issues facing the country. It’s probably the 
best day to hear him speak.”
The doors open at 7 p.m., and the event 
begins at 8 p.m.Paul will be paid 
$55,000 to come speak 
about the causes and solutions of the political 
economic situation, said 
Holtzman, a 22-year-old 
UF political science and history senior.
Admission is free.
It will be ﬁ  rst-come, ﬁ  rst-served 
seating.
Holtzman said the Q-and-A portion of the night could get controversial.
“Accent is always seeking to stir 
up controversy in a way that furthers meaningful debate about the issues facing th=e country,” he said. 
“I think it is a positive form of contro-
versy.” 
Nicole Norelli, an 18-year-old UF 
biology freshman, said she plans on seeing Paul speak.
“I heard him speak during the primary, 
and I was interested in a lot of what he had 
to say,” she said.

◗THIS IS THE SECOND YEAR IN A ROW ALACHUA 
COUNTY RANKED BEST IN FLORIDA.

Alachua County reigns supreme in Florida — in recycling.
For the second year in a row, the county has reported the 
highest recycling rates in the state, according to a report by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection.
The report is recent but shows data from 2011. Shannan 
Reynolds, a department spokeswoman, said Alachua County has a 50 percent recycling rate, a full 5 percent higher than Lee, Brevard and Marion counties.
Reynolds credits the aggressive recycling rate to the inclu-
sion of commercial waste in the recycling stream, which most counties don’t enforce.
“That’s really what it’s going to take, because it makes up 
about 67 percent of the total waste stream,” she said.
Alachua County is the furthest along in reaching the state’s 
goal of having 75 percent of all waste recycled by 2020, Reyn-olds said.Alachua highest

In an effort to reduce pedestrian 
accidents on the Southwest 62nd 
Boulevard crosswalk, the Gainesville Public Works Department installed ﬂ  ashing light signs to warn motor-
ists of people crossing the road.
The signs, known in the trafﬁ  c operations world as rectangular rap-
id ﬂ  ashing beacons, were installed last week, said Philip Mann, public works trafﬁ  c operations manager.
They look like normal pedestrian-
crossing signs, except the poles are equipped with light panels and but-tons. The lights are activated when someone presses the button, and the lights keep ﬂ  ashing for a preset time, Mann said.
The signs were met with varying  
reactions from students living in the Woodlands of Gainesville and the Pavilion on 62nd apartment com-plexes near the crosswalk.
Zachary Lash, a 21-year-old UF 
history senior and Pavilion resident, said he thinks the signs will help increase safety when crossing the road. In February, Lash and another student were rushed to the hospital after they were hit by a car while crossing the road.
“It was the cheapest, quickest so-
lution that they could ﬁ  nd to make the crosswalk safer,” he said.
Alex Kindred agreed. However, 
the 21-year-old Santa Fe business sophomore and Woodlands resi-dent said it’s been difﬁ  cult to turn out of the complex because cars pile

◗ IT’S THE FIFTH YEAR OF THE 
CREATIVE UNIVERSITY PROGRAM.
GARRETT BRUNO
Alligator Contributing Writer
A partnership between UF and Fox 
Sports culminated Monday afternoon 
in a competition that put UF advertising students’ creative prowess on display.
In the fifth year of a program called 
Creative University, Fox Sports Florida and Fox’s Sun Sports tasked a group of six UF College of Journalism and Com-munications students with producing a campaign for the Miami Marlins that will be presented to the public.
“The Miami Marlins is definitely one 
of the more interesting and challenging topics that we’ve ever given to a group of 
students,” said Eric Esteban, media rela-
tions manager for Fox Sports Florida and Sun Sports. “We will be deciding which campaign works best, and from there it’s on us to implement it.”
Overcoming impressions that the Marlins engaged in too much player trading, one idea the group created was the playful theme “Don’t Be a Trader.” In an attempt to garner a broader audience, another idea was “Show Your Scales.”
“A big problem with the Marlins was 
the current brand image,” said Matt Del-isle, a 22-year-old advertising graduate student. “You don’t want to focus too 
much on the negative.”
The students viewed this as an op-
portunity to create something for the real 
world.
“With this campaign, we had the op-
portunity to actually go into production and see something that may actually get made,” said Jonathan Muench, a 21-year-old advertising junior.
The groups presented a storyboard 
of example television spots, social media campaigns, billboard ideas, print adver-tisements and radio scripts. Fox Sports officials will discuss which ideas they wish to produce and invite the students on set to view the production.
Echoing the consensus of the group, 
Muench said, “This is real.”UF ad students compete

The rate of sexually transmitted diseas-
es in Alachua County is alarmingly high, 
but  organizations are putting forth extra efforts next month to spread awareness and reduce local infection rates.
Rebecca Tanner, a health educator at 
the Alachua County Department of Health, said the county ranks fourth in number of STDs statewide. 
The department of health is working on 
developing outreach programs that will target screenings and educational activities about STDs to areas in the community with high rates, she said.
A big problem in the county is with bac-
terial infections, she said. Some infections monitored by the state include syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea. These STDs go unnoticed because often there are no symp-toms, Tanner said.
From 2008 to 2012, women accounted 
for 68 percent of chlamydia and gonorrhea cases, according to data from the Florida 
Department of Health.
Tanner attributed the disparity to wom-
en being tested more often than men.
“A lot of men just don’t get tested as 
frequently. They don’t have a reason to get 
tested unless their partner tells them ‘look, I have something,’ or something starts burning or hurting,” she said. “If you’re having sex, especially sex without a con-
dom, you’ve got to get tested regularly.”
Victoria Joyal, a 22-year-old UF comput-
er engineering senior  and vice president of 
VOX: Voices for Planned Parenthood, said the organization is celebrating STD aware-ness month with the GYT campaign: Get Yourself Tested.
The campaign — which partners with 
MTV, the CDC and other health organiza-
tions — started Monday with tabling on 
the Reitz Union Colonnade. For the kickoff session of GYT, VOX partnered with Ga-torWell Health Promotion Services to offer free HIV testing.
Amanda, a 19-year-old UF account-
ing sophomore, said although she often sees Planned Parenthood tabling around campus, she had no idea STD Awareness 
Month existed. But she supports getting 
tested.
“You should know if you have some-
thing so you can avoid spreading it to oth-ers,” Amanda said.April is STD Awareness Month
“If you’re having sex, especially 
sex without a condom, you’ve got to 
get tested regularly.”
Rebecca Tanner
health educator at the Alachua                                   
County Department of HealthThe legislation for this goal 
was passed in 2008, but the ex-
act path to achieving the goal was left to the counties.
“It’s up to them what they 
implement, but they are re-quired to have some sort of re-cycling requirement in place,” Reynolds said.
Dale Morris, the UF solid 
waste coordinator, said UF re-alizes the way to promote recy-cling on campus is to make it more convenient. 
Over the last few years, al-
most every standalone trash can on campus has had a recy-cling bin added on.
However, Starbucks cups 
may not make up as much of UF’s waste stream as students may think.
“Most of the recycling we do on this campus has nothing to do with students,” Morris said. 
“If you looked at a pie chart of 
all the recyclables on campus, the sliver for bottles and cans is so small it’s almost nonexis-tent.”
They are certainly the most 
visible and expensive thing UF recycles, he said, but bottles and cans are only a tiny portion of 
the university’s waste stream.
UF recycled 5,472 tons of 
waste in 2012. Of that, about 
2,000 tons were paper, about 1,800 were woody debris and about 450 were concrete. Bottles and cans made up a measly 164 tons of the grand total, Morris said.
Reynolds said recycling is 
one of the top ways to be more sustainable.
“It’s one of the easier things 
to do,” she said. “It can be done at home, at work or when you’re out on vacation.”up at the road when the lights are flashing.
“It’s definitely safer for the peo-ple who do have to cross the street every day,” she said, “but it’s frus-trating for the drivers.”
Pavilion resident Taylor Michael, 
a 20-year-old UF family, youth and community sciences junior, said she feels safer on the crosswalk but still takes her own precautions when crossing the road, a mindset Mann and the public works department are trying to promote.
“We’ve put all this infrastructure 
in to help protect the people that live in the apartment complexes,” Mann said. “Now we need them to use 
the crosswalk correctly to maximize 
their safety.”
Mann added that the department 
has requested Regional Transit Sys-tem to explain how to use the signs to bus riders.
Commissioner Todd Chase, who 
called the city to take action on the crosswalk after Lash’s crash, agreed 
both drivers and pedestrians should 
be cautious at the intersection. How-ever, he said, because the crosswalk falls in the middle of a block rather than at an intersection, it could be too dangerous to use.
“I think at some point there has 
to be some kind of a common sense, reasonable approach to balancing 
the safety of pedestrians with the 
convenience of pedestrians,” he said.

For Ariel Porto, opting for 5-Hour 
Energy Shots saved her MCAT score.
“This past summer, I switched from 
coffee to energy drinks during my practice 
tests because it meant less fluids I was taking in — which meant fewer bathroom breaks,” said the 21-year-old UF psychology senior.
Although Porto doesn’t consume 
as many energy drinks now that she’s completed the MCAT, she realizes there may be risks associated with the high-caffeinated drinks.In fact, sipping on energy drinks may 
lead to high blood pressure and a change in heart rhythms, according to a study presented at a 2013 scientific session hosted by the  American Heart Association in New Orleans last week.
The study, which has not been published, 
examined the QT interval — the measure of time it takes to complete the electrical cycle in the heart — of a pool of participants who 
consumed energy drinks. 
The participants of the study were 
young, healthy 18- to 45- year-olds who did 
not have any known heart disease.
Blood pressure increased an average of 3.5 points while the QT interval was 10 
milliseconds longer than those who did not 
consume energy drinks, according to the 
study.
Dr. Gordon Tomaselli, 
the chief of cardiology at 
Johns Hopkins University 
School of Medicine and former president of the American Heart 
Association, said both 
normal, healthy people 
and especially those with heart disease are at risk.
“The concern obviously is that these cardiovascular effects certainly can have 
some influence, particularly in people who 
have pre-existing heart disease, while those who are otherwise healthy get away with it,” he said.
For college students, doctors at UF 
recommend opting for other sources of caffeine and staying away from energy drinks.
“I certainly would do all that I could 
to avoid [energy drinks] until we know more about this,” said Dr. Carl Pepine, a professor of medicine at UF.

A former South African 
judge and life-long human 
rights activist will weigh in on gay marriage today at UF Levin College of Law.
Albie Sachs, 78, who retired 
from his post as Justice of the Constitutional Court of South Africa in 2009, will speak at “Gay Marriage and the Prom-ise of Equality,” a free event held in the Chesterfield Smith Ceremonial Classroom in Hol-land Hall, Room 180. 
The event begins at noon.Sachs will discuss his role 
in the legalization of same-sex marriage in South Africa and his beliefs on human rights, said Joseph Jackson, UF Law senior legal skills professor.“He believes in a right to be 
different,” he said. “That soci-ety has an obligation to respect people for who they are.”
Sachs authored the court’s 
2005 decision that struck down South Africa’s restriction of 
marriage between one man 
and one woman, which made the country the fifth to legalize same-sex marriage. 
In 1988, a bomb planted on 
Sachs’ car by South African se-curity agents took his right arm and vision in one of his eyes.
R. Hunt Davis, a professor 
emeritus in the UF Department of History with a speciality in South African history, said Sachs should not just be seen as a gay rights activist.

ment of rights for all humans,” Davis said.Human rights activist

In the 27 years that the Ala-
chua County Library District has 
existed, citizens on the east side 
of Gainesville have asked for a 
library close enough for them to visit.  
Before the end of this year, 
those residents will have a new place to go and curl up with a good book.                                           
After years of discussing ideas 
about building a library on the 
city’s east side, the library district 
officially announced the build-ing of the new Cone Park library branch.        
Last week, residents gathered 
at the site of the future branch, which will be located at 2841 E. University Ave., for a ground-breaking ceremony. 
The 1,300 square-foot por-
table building the library district 
has used will remain until con-
struction on the project officially starts.
Eventually, the portable build-
ing will be replaced by a new 10,000 square-foot facility, which should cost $1 million.        
Phillis Filer, a public service 
administrator for the Alachua County Library District, said construction on the Cone Park li-brary is scheduled to be finished in October.
She added that construction 
may begin as early as next week.
The new branch will include 
the same amenities found in other county libraries such as a meeting room, a computer area with up to 
20 desktops and a children’s sec-
tion with a play area, Filer said.    
Shaney Livingston, the library 
district director, said the library district has signed a 99-year 
lease to locate the library in Cone 
Park. 
Filer said many people in the 
city wanted a library branch that 
was on the city’s east side.
In years past, the headquarters 
branch, at 401 E. University Ave., 
was considered the east side branch, but residents wondered 
if they’d ever see a full-fledged 
east side library.
“People are so ecstatic at the 
fact we’re doing this,” she said.Ground broken for new 10,000

Rapper Lil Wayne was hospitalized last 
week for seizures possibly associated with 
drinking a cough syrup mixture.
Local experts warn of the medicine’s 
dangers. This concoction, also known as 
“drank,” “sizzurp” or “lean,” can be made 
with different ingredients including sodas and candies.
The main components are promethazine and codeine, which can be found in commer-
cially available cough medicines.
Paul Doering, a professor of pharmacy at 
UF, said taking promethazine and codeine in 
large doses can slow or even stop breathing.
The effects of the mixture include an in-
tense feeling of euphoria, drowsiness and altered mood, Doering said.
“People underestimate its potency, and 
they underestimate the problems it can 
cause,” he said. “Lil Wayne is darn lucky he 
didn’t end up in the cemetery.”Joan Scully, substance 
abuse coordinator at UF’s Counseling & Wellness Center, has seen the drink’s effects first hand.
Scully said cough medi-
cine taken in large portions 
can act as a hallucinogen.
Anything that pro-
duces a desired effect on 
a person can be addicting, she said. People who are predisposed to addictions are more likely to struggle.
“I have worked with one person for sure 
who became addicted to the point where she had bottles in her backseat,” she said.
Scully wants students to know there are 
programs available to help those question-ing their drug use as well as ways to help them stay clean.
Danielle, a 19-year-old UF student, said 
she wanted to see what the drink was like.
“I passed out when I stood up to get wa-
ter,” she said.In wake of Lil Wayne incident, experts warn against ‘sizzurp’

Florida could be affected by two U.S. Supreme 
Court cases scheduled for hearing today and 
Wednesday that challenge laws against gay mar-
riage.
One case challenges California’s Proposition 8, 
which would effectively ban gay marriage. The oth-
er addresses the national Defense of Marriage Act, 
a federal law that recognizes marriage as a union 
between a man and a woman, said Joseph Jackson, a senior legal skills professor at the UF Levin College of Law and an associate director for the Center on Children and Families.
Jackson said if the court decides against Proposi-
tion 8 in broad terms, the ruling could compel other states like Florida to lift bans on same-sex marriage.
Florida only recognizes marriage as a legal union 
between one man and one woman, according to the Florida Constitution. It was proposed by an initia-tive petition in 2005 and adopted in 2008.
The Supreme Court may rule that California 
violates the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th 
Amendment because it allows opposite-sex couples 
to receive a traditional marriage but denies same-sex couples the same right, he said.
In light of a possible Supreme Court decision 
like this, state agencies that issue marriage licenses in states that ban gay marriage would likely issue same-sex couples marriage licenses to prevent them from filing lawsuits, he said.
Jackson said the case regarding the Defense of 
Marriage Act has the potential to affect all 50 states. The provision of the act present in the case only af-fects federal laws and would not directly affect Flor-ida’s laws.
A decision against the marriage act would only 
impact same-sex couples legally married under state law, Jackson said. They would be treated as married in federal law, meaning they could receive benefits 
like joint tax returns or Social Security.
LB Hannahs, director of LGBT Affairs at UF, said 
the California ban being lifted would mean another 
step forward for the LGBT community.
“It’s a small win because it’s another state recog-
nizing it,” she said.
Jackson said even if the court upholds Proposi-
tion 8 and the Defense of Marriage Act, more states will recognize same-sex marriage because there’s 
a trend of increasing public support for gay mar-
riage.
“Marriage is a very important relationship, and 
people care very much about who is able to get mar-ried,” he said.Supreme Court same-sex marriage 
rulings could affect Florida lawScully
“Marriage is a very important 
relationship, and people care very much 
about who is able to get married.”

OPINIONS EDITORMonday’s question: Do you think Craig 
Lowe should continue his campaign? 
Vote or post a message at www.alligator.orgToday’s question: Do you drink energy drinks?Zygote rights — let’s talk about them
Guys, let’s talk about zygotes.
What’s there to talk about, right? They’re just 
hanging out in magical uterus land, enjoying being 
the union of two gametes. They’re all like, “Hey, I’m a dip-
loid cell that contains DNA from two people! Come at me, 
bro.”
According to North Dakota, my little bro-anthropomor-
phized zygote is now a person endowed with all the legal 
and unalienable rights of a U.S. citizen.
Well that seems a little silly, don’t you think? Nonsense. 
Nothing is considered silly when it comes to the abortion battle. Bring all your junk science and skewed analogies to the table, because it is about to get absolutely ludicrous up in here.
North Dakota’s anti-abortion amendment on person-
hood sums up that since that a zygote is imbued with all the legal rights of a U.S. citizen at conception, to terminate that zygote would count as murder. The fact that this bill ban-ning all abortions has passed through the state’s House and Senate says something to the extent that a solid way to get an agenda across is to tell people their diploid cells need more rights.
But it’s the means to an end, right? It’s not about the argu-
ment itself: It’s about whatever it takes for North Dakota to outlaw abortions completely and to shut down its one lonely abortion clinic. (That’s not even an exaggeration. There is only one in the state.)
So I understand that. What bugs me is that lawmakers 
and anti-abortion advocates are so focused on the end game they don’t really believe the arguments they are making any-more.
Neither the state nor the supporters for the bill believes 
personhood begins at conception.
About 20 percent of human embryos end in miscarriage, 
according to The American College of Obstetricians and Gy-necologists. They fail to implant on the uterine lining within a certain amount of time and get ﬂ  ushed out of the woman’s body. This happens pretty quickly, and most women don’t even realize they were pregnant. 
If someone actually believed life began at conception, and that anything stopping that life was murder, this would be truly upset-ting information. Twenty percent? That’s a constant slaughter; geno-cide like the world has never seen. 
How can we fund medical research 
into helping reduce the number of lives that are taken? Can we start a 5K to help scientists ﬁ  nd a solution to stop our own murderous bodies 
from taking the lives of the innocent?
That never happens. No one thinks twice about those zy-
gotes. So it’s pretty clear people don’t really consider a fertil-ized cell a viable human life. Or at least some zygotes are 
worth more rights and public outrage than others. Person-
hood supporters could change their motto to: “Life begins after a few weeks — when we can be reasonably assured that it won’t be aborted by the body.” But I don’t think that has the same ring to it.
And apart from the laws it makes, the state doesn’t con-
sider your embryo a U.S. citizen either.
If it did, as soon as you peed that plus sign you would be 
running out to get a conception certiﬁ  cate, pick out a legal 
name and register that squirming mass of cells with a social 
security number.
The state recognizes your gift of life when, and only when, 
it has ﬁ  rst exited your body. It’s called a birth certiﬁ  cate for a reason — that is the moment when your kid is ofﬁ  cially on the societal grid. So even though the North Dakota Leg-islature may claim a zygote is a person, its hospitals, census takers and tax collectors won’t.
Of course personhood supporters in North Dakota aren’t 
actually concerned with these discrepancies — they are just trying to make sure abortions get outlawed. 
This won’t swing any views, so let this at least be an ex-
ercise in seeing the difference between the ﬁ  ght and what is being fought for.
Lauren Flannery is a business administration sophomore at 
UF. Her column runs on Tuesdays.Snooze Fest: 
Actress entertains as 
art exhibit
How many of you kids reading this article graduated from the International Baccalaureate program of your high school?
Cool! We did, too. Though it was probably not as rewarding 
as our school ofﬁ  cials sold it to us when we began the program, 
we did make an awful lot of nerdy friends during it. We were 
also forced to have a lot of thought-provoking discussions. 
We often had to look at pictures or representations of mu-
seum pieces and decide whether we considered them to be art.
Did it have to be by a professional artist? Did art only exist on 
museum walls? What if someone named a urinal “Fountain”?
Art. It’s all art. Everything is art. Theory of Knowledge was 
nearly a pointless class — until this weekend.
Actress and space queen Tilda Swinton started her own per-
formance art at the Museum of Modern Art. People went nuts. She ﬁ  rst performed this piece, titled “The Maybe,” 18 years ago in London. 
All the piece shows is Swinton “lying on a mattress in a glass 
box, apparently asleep.” The description card reads, according to the New York Times: “Living artist, glass, steel, mattress, pil-low, linen, water and spectacles.”
It’s a random piece, meaning the museum staff will only be 
notiﬁ  ed the day she decides to perform it. It’ll happen six more 
times, according to Vulture.
The Vulture article continued to say it was as if people were 
beholding an Egyptian mummy come to semi-somnambulant 
life. “Oh, she twitched!” “She’s breathing.” “Oh my God! Is that that movie star?’”
“Those who ﬁ  nd it chance upon it for themselves, live and in 
real — shared — time: now we see it, now we don’t,” read the MoMA’s statement.
So, what do you think? Is this art? Or is this a nap? It seems 
a little pretentious to us. Maybe that’s the point. Where would we be in this world if movie stars didn’t do slightly offbeat art experiments?
“Even better is the wonderful possibility that museum visi-
tors might come here, see a movie star asleep in a case, accept it as some kind of art, get super excited, and wonder how on Earth something this strange got started,” wrote the Vulture article. “And they’d rush upstairs to the greatest collection of modern art in the world, let themselves go, and add their thinking to the 
group mind.”
It doesn’t sound like the fairytale dreamland The New York 
Times paints it as, but it doesn’t have to be a waste of time ei-
ther.
Arguably, this is one of the more tame performance art pieces 
that we’ve ever heard of, mostly because it doesn’t contain any public nudity or other weird things.
(The reviewer from Vulture also reviewed one of those exhib-
its. “I don’t remember seeing this many breasts in a museum gal-
lery since the last retrospective of the nineteenth-century French 
academic painter William-Adolphe Bouguereau, and those were on canvas.”)
Good luck, artists. Keep doing weird things and one day you 
might be like Swinton — asleep in a glass box in public.

Ms. Raksheen Ayaz,
This email is in response to your 
column “Why I didn’t vote in last week’s elections” published in the Alligator on Feb. 27.  Please note that the following opinions are uniquely my own and may not reflect the position of members of my chapter or council.
I understand that the content of your 
own published column is completely up to you, I get that. But with the written word I also believe there comes power, and with that power the age-old responsibility. What I would like you to know is that in this particular case — where you called the multicultural sororities and fraternities “wannabees” — your words have done more than represent your own personal 
opinion; they have influenced and affected a whole council of Greeks and their 
potential new members at this university. Let me explain.
The Multicultural Greek Council was 
founded at the University of Florida on Nov. 15, 1999. Since its inception, the MGC has prided itself on being unique. We are not trying to be like anyone else or any other council. We are our own 
entity and love our differences. Ethnically 
based, each chapter in our council places high importance on cultural diversity and awareness. 
We do our best to celebrate who we 
are, where we come from, and interact closely and in an affirming way with other members of our council.
Our chapters are small, this is true, 
but we love that. These members are our lifelong friends, I can say that I expect my entire chapter to be at my wedding one day as well as other milestones in my life. We also respect the other Greek councils at UF and what they contribute to this community.
What we strive for is universal Greek 
Unity gained through mutual respect and relationships.
Hopefully this has given you a little 
more information on really who we are and what we stand for. 
What bothered me about your statement 
was that you spoke not from a place of knowledge but little concern of your actions’ ramifications.
For the most part, the MGC recruits new 
members and flourishes through word-of-
mouth and reputation.  Like it or not, what you said inhibits 
that. Compared to other councils, we are a 
relatively young group, and I would hate to have someone’s uninformed opinion stand in the way of our growth. 
I encourage you to reach out to any 
willing MGC member, myself included, to further discuss the topic. I’m sure you are a reasonable young woman, and I only 
noticed that you seemed misinformed.
What I can hope is that I or someone 
else can educate you more on the matter 
and together we can end misconceptions and prejudice at a great institution of higher learning like UF.

Letters to the Editor
Mitch and Cam, Stanford Blatch, Lloyd Lee, Kurt 
and Blaine, Will Truman. Who are these people, and what relevance do they share to each other?
These seven characters, among a recent many more, 
are popular culture’s depiction of homosexuality through television.
Why is this significant?
Since TV is unfortunately where most people get their 
day-to-day education, I often wonder just how accurate 
of a depiction this may be and what affect these fallacies may have.
Personally, I have met several gay men in my life thus 
far, many without even realizing it at the time. 
Rarely do they fit the cookie-cutter stereotype that pop 
culture likes to depict them as.
Such incorrect portrayals illustrate gay men as 
extremely feminine, often in appearance and behavior. 
They are exemplified as the exact opposite of what 
American society has warped little boys to aspire to be: strong, violent, tough.
In my experience, I cannot name a single television 
program that casts a tall, muscular, deep-voiced, dirty-handed male to play the gay character. 
Another perfect exemplification of this stereotype can 
be seen on YouTube in the video “Gay Men Will Marry Your Girlfriends.”
This CollegeHumor video, a calculated and alternative reasoning as to why people should approve gay marriage, threatens that gay men are better suited to 
girls than their own boyfriends, 
illustrating them all in a single way.
Every spoken sentence begins with “we,” as if all 
gay men are identical to each other in likes and dislikes, attitude and behavior.
Take the following sentences from the video for 
example: “We dress better than you” and “You don’t 
want to go dancing? We teach a dance class.”
In these cases, gay men are not only grouped into a 
single misrepresentation, but it is a representation of all things feminine.
It is this categorization of all gay men I find 
disheartening.
Most of the homosexual men I know do not fit 
this unmanly stereotype, and the fact that each of the aforementioned male television characters enjoy theater and shopping and speaking in high-toned voices misrepresents all of the gay men that exist outside of our 
televisions.
That is not to say some do behave in these ways; it 
most certainly does not mean they all do. 
If we are led through pop culture to think the sum of all 
gay men behave in the same way, should we also expect 
the behavior of straight men to be uniform in all of their likes and dislikes, as well?
We know very well that straight men — and literally 
all people in general — have very different personalities 
and interests.
To categorize a group of people as identical because of 
their sexuality, the way we have “the gay man,” is unfair 
and untrue.
Collectively perpetuating gays as feminine has negative 
influences on how they in turn get treated.
Rather than be shown the respect typically expected as 
a male, homosexual men are instead treated like a woman would be, as sensitive and weak. 
These misrepresentations of all gays as feminine 
supplies straight men with reason to “other” them and treat them as such.
In recent television history, gay and lesbian characters 
have appeared almost out of thin air, suddenly included in the plots of shows on every major network.
Ultimately, it is no real enigma that gay rights have 
simultaneously entered political agendas and debates.
But is what we interpret from this fictional realm of our 
36-inch television, whether consciously or unconsciously, at all parallel to what we might discover from meeting them in person? You can make your own conclusions, but 
unfortunately, I don’t think so.

Wearing a teal strapless gown, Tori Petry stood 
on stage as she was crowned Miss Marion County 
USA.Petry, a 20-year-old UF telecommunication 
junior, competed alongside six other women March 16 for the chance to go on to the Miss Florida USA pageant.
Not new to the pageant world, Petry was also 
crowned Miss Marion County Teen USA 2011  and was first runner-up at that year’s Miss Florida Teen USA pageant.
“Really, the best thing about going into a pageant 
is going to have fun with it and not worrying about whether you are going to win or lose,” she said.
Petry, also a model for Gainesville Fashion Week, 
said the rehearsals for the fashion show helped her prepare for the pageant. 
This is her third year involved in Gainesville 
Fashion Week, but it’s her first year being a model.
Even with her experience, Petry said, she still felt 
jitters on stage.
“It has been a while since I’ve competed in 
pageants, and it was nerve-wracking to be back on stage again,” she said. 
“I think that the onstage question part is what 
makes me the most nervous. You don’t know what to expect.”
Although a lot of what people see is the pageant 
process, Petry said she is most excited about what comes after earning a title.
“People think it’s all about getting on stage,” she 
said. 
“But my favorite part of having a title is the part 
where you go out and represent the community. It’s cool to represent the county I grew up in and love.”
Petry’s mother, Ginger Petry, is looking forward 
to her daughter attending fundraisers and charity events over the next year, too.
“She reaches out to the others around her, and she 
enjoys the whole experience, not just the competing part,” Ginger Petry said.

Alan Hodges doesn’t know 
if locally grown foods are re-
ally healthier, cheaper and of higher quality than imported ones.
“But consumers certainly 
seem to think so,” said the ex-tension scientist in the Food and Resource Economics De-partment at UF’s Institute of Food and Agricultural Sci-ences.
Hodges was one of the 
researchers in a consumer preference study by UF that found 20 percent of food eaten at home by Floridians was grown locally, to the tune of $8.3 billion in a year. Differ-ent studies indicate that other states obtain about 5 percent of their food locally.
Hodges said the two big-
gest factors were the nearly 
yearlong growing season and 
the recent media attention on local and natural foods.
Russ Welker, natural foods 
manager at Ward’s Supermar-
ket, agreed.
“Local food sales have 
grown significantly in the 
last 10 years, pushed by a big wave nationally in buying lo-cally,” he said.
Hodges said Gainesville 
residents spent an average of about $1,400 per household on local foods in a year. He said this contrasted with the statewide household average of about $1,114 spent in a year on locally grown food, pri-marily from retail grocers and farmers markets. 
“Small and medium farms, 
especially those in the North Central Florida region, have embraced the movement to-ward selling local products,” Hodges said. “They’re the ones most likely to take ad-vantage.”
Food taken home from res-
taurants accounted for $320 million of the total, according to the study. Hodges said he thinks there is a great opportu-nity to increase that amount.
“For chains, the decision 
to buy local food is usually made at the corporate level,” 
he said. “For independent res-
taurant owners or their chefs, the decision is theirs whether they are going to.”
Welker said quite a few 
Gainesville restaurants bought Ward’s locally grown and raised products, and Sum-mer Break didn’t affect sales much.
Both Hodges and Welker 
noted the diversity of consum-ers of locally grown products.
“We have the rainbow of 
humanity coming through each year,” Welker said.Floridians eat more

Justin Vanduren pointed to items on 
the glossy, new Red Robin menu.
“I always get the Whiskey River 
BBQ Chicken or the Whiskey River 
BBQ Burger,” said the 34-year-old law enforcement worker. 
“I’m definitely excited.”Vanduren was one of more than 100 
people who attended the grand opening of Red Robin, a chain restaurant known for its gourmet burgers, in the Oaks Mall at 6419 Newberry Road, Monday. 
After a soft opening and sneakpeeks 
throughout last week, the restaurant is the first and only Red Robin in Gainesville. 
“We saw the signs outside, and 
we stopped by a few times, but they were always in training or under construction,” Vanduren said. 
“I talked about Red Robin all the 
time, and now they’re finally here.”
Andy Somers, the new restaurant 
opening director, said that after the last week of anticipation, he couldn’t be more pleased with all the customer reactions.
“We’ve been full since we opened 
the doors at 11 a.m.,” he said. 
He added, “It certainly excites us 
that the community has received us so well.”
Raul Amill, Red Robin regional 
operations director, said all of the positive feedback has given the restaurant an encouraging start.
“I’d say our culture itself is different 
than other restaurants,” he said. “Some people are from Gainesville, they grew up here, and this is their first exposure to us.”
For customers like Christy Ealy, 
who had seen the commercials but never visited a Red Robin, the new Gainesville location is a welcome addition.
“I’d see the commercials and hear the 
jingle all the time and wonder, ‘What is this?’” the 39-year-old Gainesville nurse said. 
“Now I can see for myself.”More than 100 Red Robin fans welcome new Oaks Mall location

Redshirt senior guard Mike Rosario (3) celebrates with senior forward Erik Murphy (33) after Florida’s 78-64 victory against Minnesota on Sunday in Austin, Texas.
LANDON WATNICK
Alligator Writer
 
Mike Rosario lost focus early 
in the second half of No. 3 seed 
Florida’s 79-47 win against Northwestern State on Friday.
During the Demons’ first of-
fensive possession of the second half, Rosario allowed his man, forward Patrick Robinson, to cut backdoor on a screen, grab an offensive rebound and score a putback layup to cut UF’s lead to 40-34. 
With 19:24 remaining, coach 
Billy Donovan subbed out Rosa-
rio. The redshirt senior did not 
return to the game until the 6:39 mark.  
“I got asked after the North-
western State game, ‘Geez, you sat Mike Rosario for [13] min-utes?’” Donovan said. “I didn’t sit Mike Rosario for [13] min-utes. He sat himself.”
But after an erratic, eight-
point performance on 3-of-9 shooting against the Demons — during which he saw only 15 minutes on the court — Rosario finally woke up Sunday against Minnesota. 
In the third-seeded Gators’ 
78-64 victory against the No. 11 
seed Golden Gophers, Rosario 
enjoyed one of his best games at UF. The Rutgers transfer scored a team-high 25 points on 8-of-12 shooting in 34 minutes to help UF reach its third straight Sweet 16. 
Rosario drilled 6 of his 9 three-point attempts, made 3 of 4 free throws and did not com-mit a turnover in the contest. 
“I didn’t bring that full Mike 
Rosario for the first game,” Ro-sario said. “I just felt that coming into that first game, I wasn’t do-ing my job. … So I was beating myself up about it, and I was happy to come out [Sunday] and get the job done.”
Guard Scottie Wilbekin add-
ed: “I’m extremely happy. He didn’t play as well as he would have wanted to or we would want him to in the game before. It was great to see him come out like this.”
Despite playing with a dis-
located ring finger on his left hand, Rosario found his shoot-ing touch early.
After missing his first three-
point attempt, Rosario made his next three from behind the arc, with two coming on back-to-back possessions. As Florida led 13-10, Rosario buried a three from the left corner. Seven-teen seconds later, he drained a jumper from the same spot — 
this time wide open — as the 
Gators took a 16-10 lead. 
Rosario was a key factor in 
Florida’s 27-5 run, which helped it take a 48-27 halftime lead. After Minnesota cut a 
21-point lead to seven with 12:35 left, center Patric Young dished 
the ball to Rosario, who hit an 
open three from the left wing with 10:29 left to cap a 6-0 run. 
Then, at the 3:13 mark, Ro-
sario provided the dagger — a three from the right corner that stretched UF’s lead to 17 points.
“Those are some big shots,” 
Rosario said.
“The one thing that [Dono-
van] talked to me before I trans-ferred here, he said you’re put-ting yourself in big moments and big games and just being in this big situation like that. I really took full advantage of it tonight and I told myself, ‘If I’m open, I’m going to knock down 
the shot.’”
With a matchup against No. 
15 seed Florida Gulf Coast loom-
ing on Friday at 10:07 p.m. in Ar-lington, Texas, for a spot in the Elite Eight, Donovan will need Rosario to stay “focused and locked in” — a phrase he has preached to the redshirt senior 
all season. 
A victory would give the 
Gators their third straight trip to 
the Elite Eight. 
“Everybody’s different,” 
Donovan said. “I think you have to try as a coach to hit the right buttons there. Mike let’s me coach him. He takes responsibil-ity. The best part about him is he really cares about his team-mates.   … All I’m trying to get 
out of him is to be his best.”

Jaterra Bonds is ready for a rematch. 
Bonds scored 12 points on 4-of-5 shoot-
ing as Florida crushed Winthrop 85-53 in the second round of the WNIT at Winthrop Coliseum in Rock Hill, S.C., on Monday.
With the victory, the Gators advance to 
the third round of the WNIT. Florida will face Charlotte, a team the Gators have de-veloped a rivalry with during the past few seasons, on Wednesday night at 7. 
Florida was in a similar position two 
years ago, meeting Charlotte in the second round of the WNIT. 
After taking a 17-point second-half lead, 
the Gators watched the 49ers storm back to grab an 81-77 overtime victory, ending UF’s season in heartbreaking fashion. Bonds, then a freshman, led the Gators with 23 points in defeat. 
Coach Amanda Butler spent two seasons at Charlotte prior to taking the same position at Florida, meaning there is a healthy dose of familiarity between the two teams.
The Gators also feel they have a score to 
settle.  
“They came out, and they beat us the last 
time,” Bonds said. “But I don’t plan on that 
happening again.” 
After battling to earn a 
first-round victory against Florida International, 
Florida buried Winthrop (21-12) by halftime. The Eagles, who were coming off their first-ever postsea-son win — a 65-51 victory against Florida Gulf Coast 
— could not contain the Gators’ backcourt. 
January Miller connected on a pair of 
three-pointers in the first half, scoring 13 of her game-high 16 points before halftime. Kayla Lewis added nine of her 15 points be-fore the break, and Bonds chipped in with eight of her 12. 
After finishing with a career-high 28 
points against FIU, Sydney Moss notched a double-double with 13 points and 11 re-bounds. 
“We just wanted to make sure that we 
came out there in the first couple of minutes and put our foot down,” Bonds said. “These last few games, we have come out and been 
down, so we wanted to make sure we had 
the upper hand and push the tempo and run.”
The Gators refused to relent after half-
time, as Florida (20-14) led by as many as 35 points in the second half. 
“I really loved our tempo,” Butler said. 
“I thought we played great defense, and we had Florida tempo. That’s really, really im-
portant for us.” 
Monday was the third consecutive game 
the Gators faced a conference player of the 
year. 
After losing to Tennessee and Meighan Simmons, the co-Southeastern Confer-ence Player of Year, in the quarterfinals of the SEC Tournament, Florida withstood 37 points from Jerica Coley, the Sun Belt Con-ference Player of the Year, to earn a win in the first round of the WNIT. 
Winthrop guard Dequesha McClanahan, 
the Big South Player of the Year, finished with a team-best 15 points, while collecting 
five rebounds and five assists.
But nothing could slow the Gators, who 
rolled to their largest margin of victory since 
beating Alabama 87-54 on Feb. 3.
“You have to take advantage of what’s 
at hand and handle your business each and every time you step out on the court,” Bonds said. 
“We’re still playing for a championship. 
No, it’s not the NCAA, it’s the NIT, but we still want to bring a championship home.”

Bridget Sloan performs on vault in UF’s 
196.975-196.075 win against UK on Feb. 22.
GYMNASTICS
CHUCK KINGSBURY
Alligator Writer
 
One day after the Southeastern Con-
ference named Bridget Sloan Freshman 
of the Year, she reached even greater 
heights.
The Pittsboro, Ind., native claimed a 
share of the all-around title at the SEC 
Championships on Saturday in Little 
Rock, Ark.
Sloan posted a 39.75 individual total 
to help No. 1 Florida win its second con-
secutive — and ninth overall — confer-ence title.
Sloan, a former Olympian, has em-
braced the pressure of competing for the nation’s top-ranked team.
When Florida took the floor on Sat-
urday, Sloan was comfortable.
She is a six-time member of the U.S. 
Senior National Team and was the youngest member of Team USA’s sil-ver-medal squad at the 2008 Summer 
Olympics in Beijing.
In her freshman year, Sloan has 
racked up 16 individual titles — nine coming since Feb. 16.
Prior to Saturday’s competition, 
Sloan ranked second in the NCAA with 
a 39.59 average.
“I definitely think that Bridget’s com-
petitive experience has been a definite benefit,” coach Rhonda Faehn said. 
“One of the first things she said when 
we were getting ready for podium train-ing was ‘I love the podium. I can’t wait 
to compete on it,’ because that’s where 
all her competitions have taken place.”
UF opened the SEC title meet on 
vault with a relatively low score.
Florida notched a 49.375 on the ap-
paratus due to a few missteps on land-ings and found itself in fourth after the first event.
In the next rotation, however, Sloan’s 
showing helped the Gators regain their footing. Sloan tied for first on uneven bars 
with a 9.95.
She leads the nation with an average 
score of 9.868 on uneven bars.
In her final seven regular-season 
contests, the freshman placed first or second in each of her uneven bars per-formances.
And when Florida found itself in a 
close contest with Alabama heading 
into the final rotation, Sloan delivered 
yet again.
After a pair of 9.9 scores from Randy 
Stageberg and Kiersten Wang, Sloan re-
corded a 9.95 on floor.
Sloan’s score sparked Ashanee Dick-
erson, Marissa King and Kytra Hunter, 
who each posted floor scores of 9.9 or better. 
The floor scores helped lift the Gators 
over the Crimson Tide for UF’s second consecutive SEC crown.
With Sloan now in the fold, Florida 
is hopeful it can get over the hump and defeat Alabama at this year’s Super Six to win the first national championship in program history.Freshman key to SEC championship win

competitive experience has been

UF coach16, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, MARCH 26, 2013
  Not quite good enough — the four words no team 
wants to hear. For the Gators, the phrase grows louder with each close loss.
  As Florida (11-14) takes on No. 5 Florida State (22-2) 
tonight at 6 in Jacksonville, UF needs to get right-hander 
Johnny Magliozzi more involved.
  The sophomore entered 2013 as Florida’s closer. He 
has been the pitching staff’s custodian — cleaning up his 
teammates’ messes and mistakes. A closer is a premium, but Magliozzi has had just ﬁ  ve save opportunities in 13 appearances. His value is diminished in the back of the bullpen, especially with mop-up duty coming sooner and sooner. Coach Kevin O’Sullivan went to Magliozzi after UF fell behind by two runs in the ﬁ  rst in-ning of Florida’s 5-4 loss to Vander-bilt on Sunday. Magliozzi bailed out the Gators again, giving up only one unearned run in 3.2 innings.
  He won’t start against the Semi-
noles. Freshman Tucker Simpson (1-1, 4.91) will make his sixth career start. Florida State will counter with 
sophomore Luke Weaver (3-0, 1.00). Simpson didn’t make an appearance against Vandy. Magliozzi only pitched on Sunday. Florida’s combination of Sunday starters — Justin Shafer and Eric Hanhold — have allowed 26 earned runs in 32.2 innings. Neither has thrown more than 4.1 innings in a start.
  Florida is 2-4 this season in series ﬁ  nales this year. Five 
have been rubber games. The last time UF won on a Sun-day was a 6-3 victory against Miami on March 3, which 
marks the last series the Gators have clinched. 
  With Sunday woes keeping Florida from winning se-
ries, O’Sullivan should give Magliozzi the starting nod on 
Sundays.
  Every game from this point has added meaning. Only 
Georgia’s winless record in Southeastern Conference play is keeping Florida out of a four-way tie with Missouri, South Carolina and Mississippi State for last place in the league.
  A regional appearance for Florida will not be in play if 
it continues dropping two of three in a series. 
  O’Sullivan ﬁ  nds himself in a catch-22. Giving the ball 
to Magliozzi in series ﬁ  nales takes away from the bullpen. But leaving Magliozzi in the closer’s role fails to address Florida’s failing starting staff.
  Magliozzi has been one of few bright spots among 
inconsistent UF pitchers. Freshman left-hander Danny Young and sophomore right-hander Ryan Harris have 
been the Gators’ other go-to relievers. Freshman Jay Car-
michael, who began 2013 in the bullpen, is shining on Fri-day nights. 
  There’s a buzz on the ﬁ  eld when Magliozzi takes the 
mound. Whether it’s the “Wild Thing” walkup song or the ﬁ  st pumps after strikeouts, there’s something different. The difference could just be that Magliozzi throws strikes. He lives in the strike zone. He throws fastballs, changeups and curveballs for strikes in any count. 
  As a freshman last season, he made six midweek starts. 
For a team light on experience and in need of stronger starts on the mound, Magliozzi should earn a rotation spot.
  Age isn’t an excuse, but it’s been a hindrance. At three 
games under .500, it’s time to give innings to the best pitch-ers. Florida is 1-5 in one-run games. It’s time to see what this team could do with consistent starting pitching.
  The perfect scenario has a Florida starting pitcher 
reaching the sixth inning to turn the ball over to Young. Harris has been the most consistent in a group of incon-sistent setup men this season. Then, Magliozzi comes on 
for the save. 
  The problem is that this formula has been anything but 
perfect. The hitting hasn’t helped the pitching and vice 
versa. Had Karsten Whitson not injured his shoulder, per-haps this is a non-issue. It’s time to give Magliozzi a Sun-day start. Series wins depend on it.
