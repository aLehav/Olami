BIG WINBIGGER LOSS

CONCUSSION AFTER HARD
HIT IN THIRD QUARTER.

LEXINGTON, Ky. -Tebow
back to pass, hit, dropped for loss
of 3. Tackled by Wyndham.
Describing the play that knocked
UF quarterback Tim Tebow out of
Saturday's game against Kentucky
in football terms is no more effec-
tive than that simple 13-word blurb
from the final postgame notes.
Sure, backup quarterback John
Brantley was thrust into action
and might be a crucial part of the
Gators' title defense if Tebow is out
for any significant amount of time
-he returned to Gainesville on
Sunday diagnosed with a concus-
sion -but for the three minutes the
UF senior, brother, son and devout
Christian was on the ground at the
Kentucky 14-yard line, the game of
football mattered little.
"He's like my son. Imagine your
son laying on the ground," UF
coach Urban Meyer said after the
game. "My knees were shaking. I
thought, 'My goodness."' Harrison Diamond / Alligator St

US Rep. Stearns holds health care town hall forum
Hundreds gathered in the Santa Fe College gym legislation that, according to Stearns, will molikely be on the congressional floor by the er
By C.J. PRUNER
Alligator Writer
When Jerry Williamson took hold of the
microphone at Saturday's health care town
hall meeting, all the stinging hisses and jubi-
lant yells that had been bouncing off the walls
of the Santa Fe College's gym faded to a sup-
pressed murmur.
With his calm eyes locked on the assem-
bly's ringleader, Rep. Cliff Stearns, R-Fla.,
Williamson asked the one thing that had beenbouncing around his mind for a long time.
Why?
Why, the former marine and technical di-
rector of clinical chemistry at Shands at UF
wondered, were the people he met at nursing
homes allowed to waste away from debilitat-
ing diseases? Why were politicians in Wash-
ington more focused on tearing down oppos-
ing parties instead of building up the sick?
Why were the government financing projects
deemed essential while turning a blind eye to
man's greatest needs -his health?For Williamson, who obtained his under-
graduate and master's degrees through gov-
ernment military funding, it just doesn't make
sense.
Local "Our health care system is
N ewS basically a Band-Aid of hodge-
podge ideas that don't work,"
he said. "I never get tired of speaking out
against injustice."
For many of the hundreds who gathered
to hear Stearns speak, Saturday's town hall
meeting was a chance to find out more aboutaff
in
st
of the year.
Some, however, already had their minds
made up before Stearns took the podium.
"Show us any private entity that the gov-
ernment has ever taken over that has worked,"
said Keith Westbrook, a financial services pro-
fessional for Westbrook Insurance who de-
scribes himself as a conservative libertarian.
"This isn't the America that I knew and grew
up in."
Westbrook, who has two Ph.D.s, has 28

CORRECTION
An article in the Sept. 22 edi-

reported that the new garbage
pick-up schedule for Alachua

new contract begins Oct. 1, but
the date to start four-day collec-
tion is Nov. 1.
The article also reported
that the changes will not result
in a cost increase for residents.
The new contract is actually 8.7
percent higher than this year's
amount.
The article also stated that
under the current contract dif-
ferent companies manage the

Speaker discusses book
Karen Graves, an associate
professor of education at Den-
ison University in Granville,
Ohio, discussed her new book,
"And They Were Wonderful
Teachers: Florida's Purge of
Gay and Lesbian Teachers,"
Friday to about 30 students
and faculty in the Norman
Hall Terrace Room.
The book delves into the
statewide persecution of ho-
mosexual educators.
Graves said homosexual
teachers were persecuted in
Florida from 1957 to 1963. She
said they were interrogated,
tried in court and fired during
the course of the purge.
By April 1963, about 71
teaching certificates had been
revoked, she said.
"They [accused teachers]
found ways to resist," Graves
said. "It wasn't enough resis-
tance for them to win, but it
was good to see they were not
simply passive."
In her lecture, Graves said
that although the purge of
Florida's homosexual educa-
tors occurred before the peak
of the gay and lesbian move-
ment, it has important impli-
cations for American culture
today.
She said the current gay
rights movement will not be
complete until society accepts
gay and lesbian teachers.

In conjunction with World

Pets is offering free rabies vac-
cinations to the public.
Pet owners are eligible for
a free vaccination today and
Tuesday if their cats or dogs are
getting spayed or neutered.
"In order to be eligible, cats
and dogs must be over 12 weeks
old, and dogs must be under 40
pounds. Otherwise, all are wel-
come," said Jessica M. Torrence,
clinic operations manager. "We
cater to all breeds, and we are
happy to work with feral cats,
stray cats and dogs."
Dogs or cats that are still in
heat or pregnant are also eligi-
ble for the services at no addi-
tional cost, Torrence said.
Pet owners need to make an
appointment to ensure they are
eligible to receive the service,
because a large turnout is ex-
pected on both days.
Owners must book an ap-
pointment by calling 352-376-

AROUND GAINESVILLE
About 3,000 gather for Hispanic fest
By RENEE MONTALTO
Alligator Contributing Writer
The eighth annual Downtown Latino Festival
was a medley of fresh food and dirty dancing Sat-
urday that drew Gainesville residents from more
than 15 Latin American countries.
The event drew as many as 3,000 people, who
gathered in the Bo Diddley Community Plaza in
celebration of National Hispanic Heritage Month,
according to an article in The Gainesville Sun.
A nontraditional presentation of the flags of Lat-
in American countries kicked off the event.
As each country was called, natives responded
by cheering and whistling. Representatives from
each country danced their way across the stage
waving the country's flag. After all 18 were an-
nounced, they danced off the stage in a conga line.
Panama native Lucia Stiles said she was excited
to participate in an event that included so much of
Gainesville's Latin American community.
"I think the event is wonderful," she said. "The
Hispanic population here in Gainesville all shares
the same things like our language, culture and mu-
sic."
Aside from mingling with other Latinos, Stiles
had business to do Saturday. She spent part of the
festivalpromoting Spanish-owned Saul Silber Prop-
erties, which manages properties in Gainesville.
Some guests lined up an hour before the festi-
val and began to eat traditional dishes such as ar-
roz con polo (chicken with rice), tamales, guava,
cheese pastries and cheese quesadillas.
The performance that drew the most people was
by a Brazilian cultural arts exchange group, who
specializes in capoeira, a form of martial arts.
Performing in all-white outfits, the group com-
bined dancing, clapping and kicking. Ana Goni-Lessan
"I feel like many people here don't remember / Alligator Staff

STUDENT GOVERNMENT
Parties to wrap up spending
By CAROLYN TILLO
Alligator Writer
As the hype surrounding Tuesday and Wednesday's
Student Government elections builds, parties predict
that campaign expenditures will begin to decline.
Unite Party President Joey Regalado said the party
might still spend money on food and drinks for cam-
paigners.
As of the Sept. 21 finance report, the party spent $900
on stickers and $150 on pizza for a campaign meeting.
Unite Party Treasurer Ryan Mills said donations
have continued to flow in from candidates, campaign
volunteers, friends of people campaigning and party
supporters.
Taylor Cinalli, Orange and Blue Party treasurer,
said the Orange and Blue Party has also received dona-
tions from volunteers and people interested in helping
with the campaign.The party has spent about $500 on fliers and about
$410 on stickers, Cinalli said.
Orange and Blue Party President Kyle Huey said
most of the expected donations have already been re-
ceived at this point in the campaign.
Progress Party Treasurer Guiller-
mo Lopez said his party expects
more donations in the time leading- up to the election.-The party has spent about $280 on
fliers as of Sept. 21, according to cam-
paign finance reports.
Regalado Progress Party President Dave
Schneider said the party has also
created fliers with platform points specific to particu-
lar residence halls and districts, but the party does not
have many materials left to buy.
"With three days left, there really aren't too many
big expenses we're going into," Schneider said.

patents and runs a political blog that he said has been used by
conservative pundits Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh. He said
the threat universal health care poses to the country is bigger
than most citizens realize.
"You're damned right I'm scared," he said. "I am an Ameri-
can who doesn't want to see a hammer and sickle hanging over
the White House."
Using illustrations such as a bank note from Zimbabwe, a
country that has seen its monetary value inflate by the trillions,
and the monumental stack of paperwork that composes HR
3200, Stearns warned the emotionally charged crowd, which
was mostly composed of those opposing universal health care
in America, how expanded health care coverage would mean
more government intrusion and fiscal waste.
"This bill is not budget neutral," he said. "You look at the
government-run health programs such as Medicare and you'll
see that it's bankrupt. That's where we'll be heading if this
passes."
Instead, Stearns argued for a plan that allows small busi-
nesses and organizations to band together and increase their
purchasing power in order to negotiate lower health care
costs.
The Gainesville town hall meeting was one of four con-
ducted by Stearns Saturday. Stearns, who estimates that he has
done nearly 550 assemblies concerning the health care debate,
said that the assembly was a great example of citizens getting
involved and expressing their viewpoints.
"It really gets me energized to hear from the constituents,"
he said. "It's wonderful to have a bastion of free speech where
you can hear both sides."
"At the end of the day, in my heart of hearts, I want to say
that I protected the taxpayers' money."

Pro-Progress
Board supports Progress
Party, ban on stickers
the sun set over a paper-littered Turlington Plaza last
night, the Editorial Board was faced with a decision.
11. gAfter listening to Student Government leaders from
the Unite, Progress and Orange and Blue parties extol the vir-
tues of their diverse platforms, we have decided to endorse the
Progress Party for this semester's elections.
Although the Progress Party is a baby in terms of age, it
seems ready to stop the childish bickering in Student Senate
and start fixing the broken system.
While the Unite Party made lofty promises for a new stu-
dent union, the Progress Party recognized funding a $56-mil-
lion project would be downright irresponsible given the current
economic climate.
Likewise, instead of building a separate 24-hour study cen-
ter, the Progress Party will work to make another centrally lo-
cated and pre-existing building extend its hours.
We can't support building a brand new study center when
extending the CIRCA lab's hours would cost about $50,000 a
year, according to party president Dave Schneider.
The Progress Party is dedicated to maintaining fiscal respon-
sibility. This means scaling back on executive perks that don't
affect all students.
While the Orange and Blue Party calls to eliminate all SG
executive salaries, we think the Progress Party takes a more re-
alistic approach by making the salaries need-based. Being an SG
official is taxing and time-consuming, and no student should be
discouraged from political participation based on their socio-
economic status.
In addition to encouraging all students to run for elected
office, the Progress Party advocates online voting, which will
increase voter turnout. Only two out of 10 students vote in cam-
pus elections, which is when students determine who will be in
charge of the $14 million budget made of students' Activity &
Service Fees, which are collected through tuition.
Not only does the Progress Party want to increase voter
turnout, it wants people to know how elected officials vote. The
entire Progress Party has signed FERPA waivers, which gives
students access to things like voting records and Senate min-
utes. This shows the Progress Party wants senators to be held
accountable.
We agree that a handshake outside of Matherly Hall should
not be the last contact students have with their elected represen-
tatives. For that reason, we support the Progress Party's deci-
sion to make all of its senators' voting records available on the
party's Web site.
The Editorial Board also supports the intiative to ban "I Vot-
ed" stickers, which was drafted by two Orange and Blue Party
senators.
Last year, SG ordered more "I Voted" stickers than the num-
ber of students at U. Not to mention, there were 50,000 stickers
left over from the previous election.
More important than the waste of money, though, is the fact
that these stickers can be used for political coercion.
An anonymous letter to the Alligator published in February
of 2008 details how sorority members were required to bring
back "I Voted" stickers and pledge to vote for a certain party.
According to the letter, if a sister didn't bring back a sticker, she
would be punished.
Although the letter was submitted anonymously, we see no
reason to take chances.
The Editorial Board believes that the election of Progress
Party senators and the passing of the proposed anti-sticker in-
tiative will increase SG transparency and derail the current mo-
nopoly of power.
But while we encourage you to vote for the Progress Party
and in favor of the intiative to ban "I Voted" stickers, we really
just encourage you to vote this Tuesday and Wednesday.

Obama to decide fate of Afghan War
former Secretary of State and retired four-star Gen. Co-
lin Powell met with President Barack Obama in the
Oval Office in mid-September to discuss the looming
question of what to do about Afghanistan. While no one can
be certain of what the two discussed, questions from the so-
called Powell Doctrine probably floated around the room.
The Powell Doctrine is a series of questions that must
be answered affirmatively before taking any massive mili-
tary action against another country. Like most sane people,
Powell believed questions such as, "do we have a viable
exit strategy?" and "does the country actually pose a threat
to the United States?" were important when considering
whether or not to go to war. As chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff in 1990, Powell made sure these questions were
answered affirmatively in the run up to the Gulf War (a
successful war). Unfortunately, these questions were seem-
ingly not considered in the run up to the Iraq War in 2003
(a failed war).
Yet these questions have never really applied to Afghan-
istan. The Afghanistan War, after all, was always deemed
the "good war," the war that was the child of necessity, as
compared to the Iraq War, a war that was the illegitimate
child of the Bush administration's White House and De-
partment of Defense.
Al-Qaida attacked us at home, so we turned around and
attacked them at home, driving both them and the Taliban
out of their Afghan safe haven and away from the seat of
power. Then, for whichever reason history will ultimately
record, we turned our sights to Iraq.
What happened in Afghanistan when we turned our at-
tention away? For one, the Taliban has come back with a
vengeance and a thirst for control of Kabul. Al-Qaida has
popped back up along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border
and has set its sights on Islamabad. Finally, our efforts inestablishing a successful democratic
government in the country have
been doubted with the recent presi-
dential election fraud, most likely
perpetrated by Hamid Karzai, the
U.S.-friendly president.
Matthew Christ Obama, in the midst of an incred-
letters@alligator org ible debate about what role the fed-
eral government should play in its
citizens' lives, now wants to focus the national attention
on the Afghanistan war front, and whether or not to adopt
Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal's recommendation to send an
additional 40,000 troops to the perilous region.
McChrystal's route isn't the only option for Obama's
consideration. Vice President Joe Biden has also offered up a
strategy to scale back the U.S. troop presence in Afghanistan
and focus more on clearing out the al-Qaida horde there as
well as in Pakistan by using teams of elite special forces.
This week, Obama will face his most important decision
yet as commander in chief. If he decides to follow McChrys-
tal's recommendation, Obama will signal to the world that
he intends to follow former President George W. Bush's
precept of rooting out all evildoers from the world, a grossly
unrealistic and dangerous approach to foreign policy that
could lead us from the deserts of Somalia to the lush valleys
of North Korea, to every other despot's cave.
If he decides to follow Biden's recommendation, Obama
will signal to the world a return to a U.S. pragmatism that
focuses on those who do us harm, rather than the list of
those who wish to do us harm.
For that is a list a mile long with a steep body count as
its footnote.

AL ~Letters to the Editor
Pizza place will be expensive
Aramark opened new food
facilities recently in the Reitz
Union, one of which tripled sales
records from the one it replaced.
They knew the novelty of these
new places was going to attract
people, even though the prices
were comparatively high. They
knew this, but they didn't lower
their prices to the state's stan-
dards until people started com-
plaining. Why did they agree
to lower their prices so fast and
easy? Is it because they know
they were charging too much?
Now Aramark seems to be keep-
ing up with its business strategy.
Aramark is advertising that it is
going to open a new pizza place,
which there are none of right
now in the food court. One must
wait and see how high the prices
for the first couple of weeks are
going to be. I wouldn't doubt
they are going to take advantage
of the absence of a pizza place
around the food court and start
with higher prices until custom-
ers start noticing again.

Elections based on popularity
If I knew Student Govern-
ment elections would be like
this, I wish they would have sim-
ply been a popularity or hotness
contest.
With all these letters to the
editor, articles and horror stories
about SG meetings, it's clear that
this is real, corrupt, dirty poli-
tics.
It's especially reeking from
an ever-so-popular party. My
friend (who is too overquali-
fied to even run for Senate) lost
simply because her opponent's
brother was in Senate five years
ago. Fair? I think not; and she's
not exactly the most competent
candidate, either.

Stickers encourage voters
Friday's Alligator contained
a four-paragraph diatribe con-
cerning the distribution of "I
Voted" stickers during Student
Government elections. How can
one be so petty? We have stu-
dents trying to ensure the safety
of the community, to save lan-
guage programs and to allocate
money to student groups, and
you go after stickers? Those of us
in Greek houses know that it is
not "coercion" that goes on, but
rather encouragement to vote in
SG elections. With such a small
percentage of students voting
in these elections, it is shameful
that you resent Greek partici-
pation. Sen. Gary Benedix, you
seem pleased with yourself that
you "have it all figured out."
Sure, the Unite Party has
meetings with representatives
ranging from Greek houses to
the Black Student Union to the
Hispanic Student Union to the
average student. However, what
you see as corruption is actually
effective political organizing and
the most diverse coalition on
campus. Stickers and wasteful
spending are not what is really
going on here. Simply, they are
just the next talking points in the
childish blame game you all like
to play. Stick to real issues and
lay off the conspiracy theories.

Barney aids
UF blowout
ETHE REDSHIRT FRESHMAN HAD
HER FIRST TWO CAREER GOALS.
By EUGENIO TORRENS
Alligator Writer
etorrens@alligator org
It's been a long time coming for McKen-
zie Barney. More than a year, to be exact.
Barney, a redshirt freshman, tore her
right ACL in the 2008 preseason. On Sun-
day, Barney showed no lingering effects en
route to her first two college goals, as the No.
10 UF soccer team cruised to a 5-1 win over
Vanderbilt (6-3-1, 0-2 Southeastern Confer-
ence) on Sunday.
After a tightly contested
first 30 minutes of play, the
Gators (8-3, 2-0 SEC) got on
the board on a 4-yard tap-inSoccer goal by sophomore Tahnai
Annis in the 34th minute.
Holly King had the ball and found an
open Nicky Kit. Kit crossed the ball to Annis,
who was in the keeper's box. King served as
a decoy, and the ball rolled to Annis, who
tapped it in for the score.
As the first end drew to a close, Sarah
Chapman drove up the right side of the field
and passed the ball to Annis from the pen-
alty box. Annis dribbled the ball along the
goal line and shot for an easy deflection off
Vanderbilt goalkeeper Rachel Bachtel.
The problem for Bachtel was that her de-
flection left the ball a susceptible 6 yards out,
where Barney tapped it in for her first goal.
"Really, (Annis) did all the work on the
first one," said Barney, who added her sec-
ond goal in the 83rd minute.Gators dominate blocking, Crimson Tide
By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
aberry@alligator org
Mary Wise gave a quick fist pump as
she looked at the stat sheet after Sunday's
match. The Gators didn't just outblock an
opponent for the first time this season, they
dominated at the net.
No. 5 Florida (10-1, 4-0 Southeastern
Conference) put up eight blocks to Ala-
bama's one, and the Gators dismantled
the Crimson Tide 3-0 (25-16, 25-11, 25-14)
in the O'Connell Center on Sunday. The
sweep against Alabama (5-9, 3-1 SEC) was
UF's third straight and the second of the
weekend, as Florida breezed by Missis-
sippi State (4-11, 0-4 SEC) on Friday (25-12,
25-14, 25-18).
"The blocks didn't happen by accident.
We're doing something right," said Wise,
who is undefeated against Alabama in her
19 years at UF. "We're working at it daily,
and I don't think the players were any
less frustrated that we weren't recording
blocks than the coaches."
Sunday was the first time the Gators
came away with a blocking advantage
since Dec. 6, when UF outblocked Colo-
rado State nine to five in last year's NCAA
Tournament.
Sophomore middle blocker Cassandra
Anderson led the team with five block as-
sists, sophomore outside hitter Colleen
Ward added four block assists and senior
Kristina Johnson contributed a solo block
and two block assists.
After spending the first part of the
team's practice the last few weeks working
on blocking, outside hitter Kristy Jaeckelsaid the effort paid off Sunday.
"I think it was just a matter of time be-
fore our blocking was going to start click-
ing," Jaeckel said. "We've been putting in-'7the time, putting in the technique, so it was
just a matter of time before it all came to-
gether and we started touching balls and
making plays."

Calathes wraps up whirlwind summer with EuroBasket
EHE AVERAGED 4.1 POINTS,
2.1 REBOUNDS AND TWO
ASSISTS FOR GREECE.
By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
aberry@alligator org
Since May, Nick Calathes has
gone from Gainesville to Greece,
had his rights traded from Min-
nesota to Dallas and made the
jump from the Southeastern Con-
ference to the European champi-
onships.
Friday night, Calathes was
back in the O'Connell Center,
taking a few minutes to answer
questions while sitting in the
stands and watching the UF vol-
leyball team sweep Mississippi
State.
The former Gators star played
with the Greek national team in
EuroBasket 2009 in Poland this
month, averaging 4.1 points, 2.1
rebounds, two assists and 1.6
steals while playing more than 17
minutes per game.
Greece took home the bronze
medal in the tournament. Led
by Los Angeles Lakers center
and tournament MVP Pau Gasol,
Spain topped Serbia to win the
championship.
"It was a great experience for
me to learn the game, learn a new
style for the summer," Calathes
said. "That's the national team,
so that's the best players in the
whole country. It's definitely dif-
ferent .different competition,
playing against Tony Parker, Pau
Gasol, all those guys."
His father, John Calathes, said
the transition hasn't been very
difficult given Calathes' ability toAndrew Stanfill / Alligator Staff
Former UF point guard Nick Calathes attended the UF volleyball match Friday night and spoke about his
experience with the Greek national team at the European championships earlier this month.
adjust to whatever role he needs
to play.
"He can run a slowed-down
pace, he can run the fast break, he
can do whatever," John Calathes
said in a phone interview. "One
of his real strengths has alwaysbeen being able to find out what
the coach wants and giving him
what he wants."
Calathes will have plenty of
time to get used to the slower
pace of European basketball, as
he signed a contract earlier thissummer with Panathinaikos, an
elite Euroleague club.
"It's kind of a decision you
can't pass up. He's going to be
playing for the best team in Eu-
rope, arguably the world," John
Calathes said. "To have an op-portunity like that, to be able to
go over to Greece and play for
the Greek national team and stuff
like that, it all just kind of goes
together. From his standpoint, it's
the opportunity of a lifetime."
His deal with Panathinaikos
is worth around $1.1 million per
year and includes a house, car,
tax credits and endorsements.
According to his father, Calathes'
new four-story home has a bal-
cony with a view overlooking the
city of Athens.
Calathes isn't the only former
Gator making a living on the
court in Greece these days.
Taurean Green, the starting
point guard on UF's back-to-back
national championship teams, is
now playing for AEK, a Greek
League club located about 10 to
15 minutes from where Nick and
his brother Pat reside.
Green has been friends with
Calathes and his brother since
they were young, as they all
played together on an AAU squad
for 10-, 11- and 12-year-olds.
Should Calathes want to re-
turn to America, the soonest he
can opt out of his contract with
Panathinaikos and play in the
NBA would be the 2010-11 sea-
son.
The Minnesota Timberwolves
picked him 45th overall in this
year's NBA Draft but traded his
rights to the Dallas Mavericks.
Calathes said he has spoken
to Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle
and that "everything's good" re-
garding his standing with Dallas.
"They have my rights and
everything like that," he added.
"Whatever happens, happens,
but right now, I'm focusing on
Panathinaikos this year."
Gators will need to refocus, find alternate playmakers if Tebow sits
LEXINGTON, Ky.
im Tebow could not get up for closeto three minutes after getting hit
by Taylor Wyndham and hitting
the back of his head on Marcus Gilbert's
knee.
The rest of The Gator Nation is still
struggling to get up.
As he lay there, barely moving, there
should have been no thoughts about his
chances for a second Heisman or champi-
onship hopes.
The only thing anyone should haveBobby Callovi
Bobby's World
bcallovi@alligator orgcared about is if
Tebow would be able
to get up, and when
he did, if he would
be OK from the dev-
astating blow.
But as more news
comes out about him
being coherent and
being released from
the hospital, it is time to start wondering
-what now?
How do the Gators rebound from theirleader and motivator getting knocked
out?
When Florida was down last year after
the Ole Miss loss, it was Tebow's speech
that rallied the troops and drove them to
Miami for the BCS National Champion-
ship Game.
In 2007, when the defense couldn't stop
anyone and no running back could be
trusted with the ball, it was Tebow who
threw the team on his back and carried
them through the season.
But what if he can't do that anymore?What if the Gators need someone else
to make the crucial plays when the time
calls for it?
The first thing is that he should not
force it. This is not a sore shoulder or a
tight back. It was a concussion, and if peo-
ple are saying he shouldn't go, he should
not play.
It's that easy, especially with how he
plays.
He is going to take hits. If he returns too

El understand ESPN2 wanted to keep viewers informed, but I've never seen any-
one get as much national TV exposure throwing up as Tim Tebow. .It's becom-
ing more and more clear the college football hierarchy this season is Florida,
Texas, Alabama and everybody else. .I read recently a suggestion to let NFL
fans keep footballs kicked into the stands. Seems like a good idea to me.a

FOOTBALL, from page 1
Wyndham made exactly one tackle
in the 41-7 blowout. He came off
the edge of the left side of UF's of-
fensive line, ran free at the quarter-
back after left tackle Matt Patchan
blocked down on the play and hit
Tebow flush without the lefty ever
seeing him coming.
Tebow's gaze was turned down-field as he stood planted in the
pocket, and as he fell backward,
his head slammed into the knee of
right tackle Marcus Gilbert, snap-
ping his neck forward and leaving
him motionless on his back.
"It was just a normal hit. I didn't
really think that much about it,"
Wyndham said. "He is a big guy.
I just thought that it was a normal
play and a normal hit and every-thing."
Wyndham popped up and be-
gan to celebrate with teammates
after sacking the Heisman Trophy
winner for a big third-down stop.
The crowd erupted and the ball
laid on the ground as motionless
as Tebow, whose arms bent at his
sides in a position known as "fenc-
ing" -a clear sign of a concussion.

no avail, as the dead weight clearly
signified that the previously inde-
structible superhero was now re-
duced to a mere mortal like every-
one else.
Both teams crept onto the field to
see what was wrong and show sup-
port as the training staff examined
Tebow. Meyer held his hand, and
offensive coordinator Steve Add-
azio stood over him, bewildered.
"I ain't seen Timmy lay on his
back since he's been at Florida," of-
fensive guard Mike Pouncey said.
The same player who took on
Eric Berry headfirst on a scramble
in The Swamp only a week ago was
seriously hurt from standing in the
pocket and taking a sack.
The previously raucous road
crowd went from excited to wor-
ried, just as The Gator Nation must
have from 700 miles away.
Chants of "Tee-Bow! Tee-Bow!"
swept through the stadium as Ken-
tucky fans and Florida fans meshed
together as college football fans try-
ing to revive the player who has
come to be the face of the sport for
more than two years now.
"Anytime you see a player
like that, it's the worst part of this
game," Addazio said.
After what seemed like an eter-
nity, the trainers helped him walk
off the field under his own power
and examined him on the training
table, shining light into his eyes
while testing his memory.
Tebow was then carted into the
locker room while he threw up
into a red plastic bag with a towel
draped over his head.
"It was shocking to me because
I've never really seen him like that,"
redshirt senior linebacker Ryan
Stamper said. "I didn't really know
the issue with him. I was just pray-
ing to God it wasn't a neck issue.
When I just heard their fans cheer-
ing, I didn't know what they were
cheering for. They were probably
just cheering because it was a good
play, but I don't know if they were
cheering because it was a good play
or because he got hurt. I don't think
it was because he got hurt, but
that's kind of how you take it when
he's on the field."

the offense moved along conserva-
tively in an effort to end the game
as soon as possible.
Meyer stayed overnight in Lex-
ington with his quarterback, while
the rest of the team flew back to
Gainesville immediately following
the victory.
Just as he was unable to fly back
with his teammates, Tebow was
unable to fly to Lexington with his
teammates Friday.
Tebow was one of 12 sick play-
ers, including Major Wright, Joe
Haden and Riley Cooper, who flew
on a separate plane from the rest of
the team.
"Of course you want to
remember both, but you'll
never forget the moment
that happened out there
with Tim Tebow. You'll
never forget that."
Ryan Stamper
UF redshirt senior linebacker
Each of those four took two bags
of IV fluid before the start of the
game, and Meyer said he was close
to not letting Tebow play at all due
to illness.
"Tim, you'd have to shoot him
to hold him out," Meyer said. "He's
going to play."
The two-time national champion
showed no signs of being slowed
down by sickness and ran the ball
better than he had all season.
Tebow rushed 16 times for 123
yards and two touchdowns and
added 103 yards and one touch-
down through the air.
On the legs of their team leader,
the Gators scored 31 points in the
first quarter, the highest total ever
in the opening 15 minutes by a
Meyer-coached team.
But when players, coaches, me-
dia and fans look back on this game
weeks, months or years from now,
the statistics will be nothing more
than a footnote.
"Of course you want to remem-
ber both, but you'll never forget the
moment that happened out there
with Tim Tebow," Stamper said.
"You'll never forget that."

soon, he will be more likely to get another
concussion.
It is not just his playing career at stake.
It is his future, and that should be concern
No. 1.
If Tebow can't go, it will be John Brant-
ley taking the snaps and leading the offense,
but the three running backs will need to el-
evate their games and help make Brantley's
job easier, because he can't replace Tebow
just yet.
The defense must be the unit it was last
year -maybe even better -because with-
out Tebow, the offense will need help.
The real question mark is who will take
over in a tight late-game situation.
It's hard for a defensive player, even a
star like Brandon Spikes, to take over a
game, so it will be on the shoulders of one
of the running backs or Brantley.
Only time will tell who that guy will be,
but it can't be something that is forced.
For now, the team has to refocus and re-
member what its goals are for the year.
After the hit, it seemed nobody wanted
to be on the field.
The defense had a tackle for a loss and
an interception on the next drive, and there
was little celebration or excitement about
those plays.
It was clear everybody's minds were on
Tebow, and rightfully so, but UF will need
to put what happened behind it and try to
accomplish its goals no matter if it is Tebow
or Brantley taking the snaps.
So, it's time to dust yourselves off and
get up because there are still eight games
left and a lot to do.'IkwwFlorida ill
