WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?
RICHARD JOHNSON
Alligator Sports Columnist @RagjUF
Firing Will Muschamp in the 
middle of October is not the answer.
What happened Saturday night 
was, in my opinion, the low-point 
of the Muschamp era. The Georgia 
Southern loss was awful and in-
excusable, but at least Florida was competitive in that one. 
The Gators shot themselves in 
the foot with a Gatling gun on Sat-urday night to the tune of six turn-overs that produced 24 points.
I know athletics director Jeremy 
Foley’s famous quote delivered after 
the ﬁ  ring of Ron Zook in 2004.
“When the situation starts go-
ing downhill, it’s hard sometimes to 
push it back up. I think the situation got out of control, even for him,” Fo-ley said.
Perhaps it is only ﬁ  tting that 
Zook was ﬁ  red after an embarrass-ing loss to Mississippi State nearly 
10 years to the day — Oct. 26, 2004 
— as Muschamp’s worst loss in his tenure in Gainesville.
I know you want Foley to drop 
the hammer. I read way too many of your tweets directed at me to not know that. I heard you chanting “ﬁ  re Will Muschamp,” as the game ended (even if Muschamp himself 
did not). But my question to you, is “OK, 
you ﬁ  red Muschamp with ﬁ  ve 
games left, and then what hap-pens?”
You get rid of Muschamp now 
and you appease the mob, the horde of Gators fans that grows more nu-merous as each loss mounts. Re-member — we’re talking about whether Muschamp should be ﬁ  red during the season. What happens af-ter the season is another story.
Remember, Zook didn’t go away 
when Foley canned him. He ﬁ  n-ished out the regular season, even triumphing over Florida State and being carried off into the sunset on his team’s shoulders. 
Zook only didn’t coach the bowl 
game that year because he got anoth-er job, so don’t think Foley dropping a hammer on Muschamp would be 
the end. 
If you get rid of Muschamp you 
turn the team over in the interim to 
offensive coordinator Kurt Roper — who’s in his ﬁ  rst year here — or D.J. Durkin, who is just a Muschamp re-tread in the sense of being a defen-sive guy that has coached under him on that side of the ball. 
Perhaps it may get Foley a chance 
to look at other candidates, but who exactly, and shouldn’t he already be Mid-season ﬁ  ring is not the answer

The ofﬁ  cer-involved shooting in 
Alachua County on Tuesday night did 
not occur as originally reported, the Alachua County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce an-nounced Friday.
Police originally said a woman 
called law enforcement when Timo-thy Brower, 49, threatened suicide while armed with a riﬂ  e. The woman told police she left 14114 NW 173rd St., climbed into a white van parked outside and locked its doors. Brower then followed her, police said, smash-ing one of the van’s windows before driving away with the woman.Police pursued the car, which ar-
rived at Brower’s second address, 211 SE Wacahoota Road.
When police arrived, they initially 
said Brower was dragging the woman toward the house, still armed with a 
riﬂ  e. Ofﬁ  cers said they shot at Brow-
er in an effort to protect the woman and police on scene, but Friday’s an-nouncement contradicts that.
The sheriff’s ofﬁ  ce said Friday that 
Brower exited the car armed with a ri-ﬂ  e, as originally reported, but was not dragging the woman from the car. In-stead, he walked toward the home as 
Deputy Daniel Qualmann ﬁ  red shots 
at him, hitting Brower in the lower tor-so. The shot was not life-threatening, but Brower ultimately went inside of the house and fatally shot himself.

Students pushed their way through the 
crowd to get a closer look at Ludacris on Fri-
day night during Gator Growl.
The “Limitless”-themed night included 
talent acts, food trucks, a venue change and a music-festival atmosphere.
But it did reach a limit on one thing: tick-
ets.
Growl completely sold out. It sold 17,000 
tickets, 2,000 more than last year, before the show started at 6 p.m.
“It’s great to see thousands of students 
feel proud to come to this university,” said Jonathan Schonfeld, a Student Government Productions co-chairman and UF ﬁ  nance se-nior.Billed as the No. 1 student-run pep ral-
ly in the nation, Growl transformed Flavet 
Field into a sea of spirited students.
Students roamed the ﬁ  eld before the 
show, eating from food trucks like Humble 
Pie and Monsta Lobsta and getting free cans of Mountain Dew Kickstart energy drinks 
and Geico sunglasses.
The beer and wine garden was packed 
until it closed at the start of Foster the Peo-
ple’s performance at about 8 p.m.Change of venue breathes 
new life into 91st Gator Growl

Kaitlin McCarroll clutched her 
mom as she rode on the back of 
Marion Rose Harvey’s motor-
cycle for the first time. The pair 
rumbled through back roads and weaved past wetlands.
“For those of you who don’t 
know, I’m terrified of riding bikes,” the 19-year-old said in her mom’s eulogy three weeks later.
A room of mourners in ties, 
leather and tears listened.
“It was an hour long, and 
it was pouring rain,” she said, pausing to laugh. “But I’m so glad we did.”
On Oct. 8, just after Harvey 
crested the northbound hill near the 34th Street Wall and slowed to a stop, a Toyota Camry plowed into the 51-year-old mother of 
four and her scooter from behind 
— a vehicle Harvey had pur-chased from her boyfriend that morning.
The blow threw Harvey for-
ward into a stopped GMC Sierra pickup truck. As responders ar-rived, she sustained a pulse. But in the emergency room, the ex-
perienced motorcyclist was pro-
nounced dead.
“My mom was an amazing 
woman and an amazing mom,” McCarroll said at her service, fighting back tears next to Har-vey’s parked, dark red Honda Shadow Sabre motorcycle, her 
preferred method of transporta-
tion.
“It wasn’t a scooter issue,” 
said Ed Cutler, a member of Gator 
Riders, the local motorcycle rid-
ing group Harvey was a part of.
He said Harvey had a near-
ly four-year biking habit she couldn’t quit.
“She had a lot of miles,” Cut-
ler said. “She was a safe rider. I rode with her very often.”
  
Five minutes before the acci-
dent, Harvey texted Paul John-son, her boyfriend of about one year.
She’d just finished a late-work 
meeting as an accountant at Jack-son Hewitt Tax Service.
Harvey wanted to join him 
and a group of Gator Riders for 
chicken wings at Gator Tales 
Sports Bar, and she wanted to show off her new scooter.
“Still gonna be there?” John-
son said Harvey messaged him at 
7:15 p.m.
While her motorcycle was 
quick, her new scooter was con-
venient. It got 75 miles to the gal-
lon, and work was only about 2 
1/2 miles from her house.Johnson told Harvey they 
were eating, but he would wait. Harvey was proud of her pur-chase, and the group was excited 
to see it.
But Harvey never made it to 
dinner.
Johnson called. He texted. Af-
ter about 8 p.m., Johnson left the 
group of bikers and drove home to check on her.
He noticed Southwest 34th 
Street was closed.
“That could have been her,” 
he thought, but he quickly re-jected it. “I’m not going to think that way.”
At home, Harvey’s daughter 
McCarroll later greeted him with the news.
“It’s been a whirlwind of emo-
tions since then,” Johnson said.
  
Just after 9 a.m. Friday, about 
40 Gator Riders gathered at the Deerhaven Marathon gas sta-
tion off U.S. 441, hoisting a large 
American flag behind the motor-cycle that would lead Harvey’s memorial procession.
In the cool morning air, they 
exchanged soft words and sol-emn hugs.
McCarroll climbed on the back 
of the first bike — the second time 
she’d ridden a motorcycle and 
the first without her mom.“I was nervous at first,” McCa-
rroll said. But somewhere under the hanging trees and speckled sunshine of Florida’s country-
side, she began to let go.
“Suck it up, buttercup,” Har-
vey always told her kids growing 
up.
After about an hour of ripping 
down small scenic roads to Fort White, Florida, more than 100 family members, friends and co-workers gathered in the town’s 
community center to celebrate 
Harvey’s life.
One of Harvey’s closest 
friends, Suzzanne Zorilo, remi-
nisced on the girls’ trip she, Har-
vey and another woman took the weekend before she died.
For six hours, the three rode 
their bikes north to Panama City 
Beach. They rented a hotel room together and spent three days un-
winding and exploring the town before heading back home.
At the service, Zorilo held a 
small bobblehead sea turtle in her hand — a token Harvey had given her to remember their trip by.
At Harvey’s bike, Zorilo low-
ered her head. A 5-by-7-inch black frame sat on the seat, hous-ing a photo of her friend on her ride, smiling wide.
Reaching forward, Zorilo 
touched the bright blue parking tag from their Panama City hotel that still hung from its handle.
“Part of me thinks she wishes 
she passed away on her motor-cycle instead of a damn scooter,” Zorilo said. “Of all things, a damn scooter.”

A memorial procession of about 40 motorcycles and a handful of 
cars head up a hill to Fort White, Florida, for Marion Rose Harvey’s service Friday.
“We never ran out of alcohol, and it was 
very successful for our first time having 
the garden,” said Haley Doyle, Growl’s as-
sociate producer of communications and a 
20-year-old UF marketing junior.
Students sat on damp grass and clus-
tered around the stage while the Home-
coming court was presented.
When Foster the People came on, the 
crowd sang along to hits like “Pumped Up 
Kicks” and their closer, “Don’t Stop.”
Former “Saturday Night Live” cast 
member Brooks Wheelan began his 10-min-ute set by asking, “Gator Growl, how the f**k are you?”
“It was unfortunate that it didn’t turn 
out as we expected and was a rough per-formance, to say the least,” Schonfeld, 22, said. 
Wheelan was booed by the crowd.“I was embarrassed that people would 
boo him because if he’s not funny, just don’t laugh,” said Ernesto Cejas, a UF finance se-nior.
Fireworks lit up the sky before and after 
Ludacris took the stage.
The Grammy award-winning rapper 
made the crowd shake their “Money Mak-
er” to hits like “Act a Fool,” “What’s Your 
Fantasy” and “Get Back.”
“He made me feel like I was back in 
middle school and made it an unforgettable experience,” Cejas, 20, said.
After 82 years in The Swamp, Growl was  
moved to Flavet Field for its 91st celebra-tion, according to Alligator archives.
“It was a change that needed to happen, 
and it trumped any other show,” Schonfeld said. “It put students in the driver seat, gave people what they wanted to see and 
made Gator Growl something cool again.”4, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, OCTOBER 20, 2014

A white picket fence sur-
rounded a quaint house as bal-
loons tugged at its roof. The cardboard house in the “Up”-themed float wheeled down 
the street Friday at the annual 
Homecoming Parade.
Morgan Pinkerton, 19,  
who dressed as Ellie from the Disney movie, waved as she walked alongside the UF Keys Governing Body float.
“We went with ‘Up’ because 
‘the sky’s the limit’ is where we were going with the limitless theme,” said Pinkerton, a UF biology sophomore. “Disney is 
pretty universal, and it’s really 
easy to bring all kinds of gen-erations into that.”
People of all ages lined 
West University Avenue to watch the parade and show off 
their Gator spirit.
“It’s a lot of fun,” said Mak-
insy Fitzgerald, a 17-year-old 
senior at Oak Hall School. “You have a lot of variety.”At the head of the parade 
was UF President Bernie Ma-chen, followed by UF mascots Albert and Alberta. A variety 
of student clubs, high school 
bands, local businesses and Gainesville organizations fol-lowed.
Veterans sped down the 
street in go-karts, while unicy-clists rode close to the crowd to high-five onlookers, and gym-nastics teams did backflips 
down the street.
“Everyone’s so excited, 
everyone’s active, everyone’s 
putting their all into it,” said Milan Raiford, a 19-year-old UF psychology and women’s studies sophomore.
During the parade, floats 
embraced this year’s home-
coming theme, “Limitless,” 
with images of the sky and outer space.
Pinkerton said the event 
is a great opportunity for the community to work together to show its spirit.

transforms.”Parade showcases

Sixty-four people were either 
arrested or ejected from the UF 
vs. University of Missouri Home-
coming football game Saturday 
night — about half the number from the last home game against Louisiana State University on 
Oct. 11.
Of the 55 who were ejected at 
the game, 15 were UF students. Twenty-five ejections were for 
possession of alcohol, along with 
11 for intoxication, eight for dis-
orderly conduct, four for ticket switching, three for not having a ticket, two for sitting in the wrong section and two for stand-
ing in the aisle.
Nine arrests were made — the 
same as this season’s LSU game, 
which had the most arrests since 
the UF vs. University of South 
Carolina home game on Oct. 20, 2012. Two arrests from Saturday’s game were UF students.
Of the nine arrests, four were 
for resisting without violence, three were for trespassing after warning and two were for disor-derly conduct.
There were 46 more arrests 
and ejections made Saturday than the last time UF played the University of Missouri on Nov. 3, 2012. During that game, there 
were 18 ejections, eight of which 
were UF students. There were no arrests — only civil citations for people in possession of alcohol. 55 ejected, 9 arrested at Sat. game◗ IT’S NOT RELATED TO OTHER ASSAULTS.

A man was sexually battered Saturday night after 
police said he was approached from behind and taken 
to a patch of woods by another man near McCarty 
Hall.
The victim said he was walking on McCarty Drive 
between Newins-Ziegler Hall and the McCarty Hall 
parking lot shortly before 8 p.m., police said. While 
walking, a man came up behind him and grabbed him 
by the arm before taking him into the woods.
The victim said once they entered the woods, the man sexually battered him and then fled the area on foot. He is not pursuing a criminal investigation.
The 5-foot-8-inch, 150-pound suspect had tan skin 
and light brown hair, police said. The victim said he 
was wearing blue jeans and a “brownish/reddish” 
polo shirt.
University Police said there is no indication at the 
time that this incident is related to the string of as-saults that occurred both on and near UF’s campus in 
late August and early September.
Police still urge students to avoid walking alone 
and to utilize the Student Nighttime Auxiliary Patrol, 
which operates from 8:30 p.m. to 3 a.m. daily. Students 
can also use the Walk Safe escort service, which oper-
ates from 7 to 11 p.m. throughout the week as well. UF alerts of sexual battery in woods HoMECoMINgARIANA FIGUEROA

Busy students looking to keep up with 
UF Student Government can now do so with 
SGTV.
Every Friday night, SG will upload a two- 
to three-minute video on YouTube to recap what happened in SG that week.About 380 viewers watched the first epi-
sode, which was posted three weeks ago. The videos are produced by Action SG, an agency created to bring transparency and accountability to SG. The program will also be aired on Channel 8, UF’s Resident TV channel.
“The main purpose is to further increase 
transparency in Student Government,” said Sarah Daly, chairwoman of SGTV. “If you 
want to know what’s going on in the world 
of SG, it’s a great way to get information.”
Action SG picks two or three of SG’s most 
important activities to highlight each week, 
she said. Daly said she did not know what time the videos would be uploaded or aired

A Gainesville man was ar-
rested late Friday after police 
said he kissed an 11-year-old 
girl with an open mouth be-
fore fondling her breasts.
Dwayne Eric Baker was 
visiting a friend’s house at 13 
NE 15th St. when he saw the 
victim sleeping on a couch at about 11 p.m. He approached the victim and said, “You have a pretty face,” accord-
ing to police. 
The 47-year-old then 
started playing with the vic-
tim’s face, kissing her on the 
lips and putting his tongue 
inside of her mouth. He then touched the 11-year-old’s breasts through her clothes.
The girl ran to her mother 
who was in another room, police said. The woman said her daughter was visibly shaken and crying when she 
told her what Baker did.
Baker was confronted 
by the girl’s family before 
leaving the residence. The victim’s mother and an-
other witness followed him 
and contacted police, who later found Baker at 1800 E. Hawthorne Road. Police also 
found about 2 grams of can-
nabis in Baker’s pocket.
Baker denied ever touch-
ing or kissing the victim.
He was arrested on two 
charges of lewd and lascivi-ous behavior, marijuana pos-session and drug-equipment possession. His bond is cur-
rently set at $315,000.

A Gainesville man was 
arrested early Thursday 
morning after police said he 
smashed his fiancee’s head 
between a door frame and picked up her daughter by the hair when the 9-year-old 
tried to call police.
At about 3:40 a.m., Chris-
topher Mark Walsh, 54, got 
into an argument with his fi-ancee at 1800 NW Fourth St. 
The victim — whom 
Walsh lives with and has a child with — then tried to leave the residence before 
the man grabbed her by her 
hair and dragged her inside.
Walsh then smashed the 
victim’s head back and forth between a door frame — cut-
ting the woman above her left eyebrow, a report said.
When the victim’s daugh-
ter, who is not Walsh’s 
daughter, heard the argu-ment and tried to call police, 
Walsh grabbed her by the 
hair and lifted her off the ground. He then dropped the girl — leaving a lump on her head — and said, “You’re not 
the boss of my house.”
When police arrived, the 
woman told police Walsh 
“tossed her around like a rag 
doll” and that he had been 
abusive before. Walsh was charged with domestic bat-tery most recently on Dec. 17, 2012.
Walsh was arrested on 
charges of cruelty toward a child, battery and false im-prisonment. His bond is cur-rently set at $30,000.

A Gainesville man was 
arrested Saturday evening after police said he had sex 
with his live-in girlfriend’s 
14-year-old daughter.
On Oct. 7, the victim’s 
mother left for work at about 
10:30 p.m. from her house, 
located at 2820 NW 13th St. With the woman gone, Demetrius Antonio Brewer, 
28, was left alone with her 
daughter. 
When the woman re-
turned from work unexpect-edly about an hour later, she 
found Brewer, who didn’t 
have clothes on, in bed with her daughter, a report said. Brewer and the victim were 
startled and jumped out of 
the bed.
Police were not contacted 
at the time of the incident but were later notified when the 
daughter went to the Ala-
chua County Health Depart-ment and told medical staff that she had sexual inter-
course with Brewer. 
A report said the de-
partment contacted the De-
partment of Children and Families, which then called police.
The victim told her moth-
er and sister that she and Brewer had sexual inter-course, but she did not give him consent.
Brewer was arrested on 
charges of sexual battery on a person under 18 years old. His bond is currently set at 
$150,000.Police roundup: lewd 
behavior; battery;  sexual battery
locAl◗ BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU 
GAVE THE COMPANY AN F.
PATRICK PINAK
Alligator Staff Writer ppinak@alligator.org
Uber may have failed nationally 
this month, but the app-powered 
ride service is passing the test for Gainesville customers.
The Better Business Bureau, 
a nonprofit consumer advocacy council, gave the company an F rat-ing last week after reviewing more than 100 complaints filed in the last three years. An F is the lowest on the council’s A+ to F scale.
Most of the complaints were re-
lated to the company’s surge pric-ing policy, in which rates increase 
during busy times such as holidays. 
Uber spokesman Taylor Bennett wrote in an email that Uber hasn’t received any surge pricing com-plaints in Gainesville since it arrived in August.
“Surge pricing helps bring de-
mand and supply into line, when necessary by incentivizing more drivers to come onto the platform,” Bennett said.
Victoria Lunkes, 22, said she was 
hired as an Uber driver about two weeks ago. She said surge pricing was in effect Saturday because of the football game.
The highest surge pricing she 
saw was three times the normal ride rate. She said she gave about 10 to 15 rides from 7 to 11 p.m. Saturday.
“If we had more drivers, there 
probably wouldn’t be high surge pricing,” she said. 
Lunkes said Uber’s biggest prob-
lem in Gainesville is its lack of driv-ers. The UF advertising senior said she used the service regularly while in Chicago last summer and that drivers were always available within 5 miles of her location. Lunkes said Uber has been pushing for drivers to recruit friends to apply through incentives.
Jessie Berens, 21, said she’s 
used Uber twice since it arrived in Gainesville — once in September 
and once in October. She said she’s 
noticed an increase of drivers since her first ride. Berens, a UF dietet-ics and psychology senior, said she hasn’t personally seen surge pricing in Gainesville.
“It’s not ideal for prices to go up 
during busier times, but I guess I understand why,” she said. “They 
are a business and need to make a 
profit, and they do need to take the clients who are willing to get them the most profit when they have a lot of people.”
Berens said the F is a little harsh. 
She’d give the business a B.
“I think it has some kinks to work 
out, especially in smaller towns 
where it’s newer, but I think over-
all, they’ve done a really good job implementing their services here.”Locals weigh in on Uber failing grade

Anniel Rodriguez started playing guitar when he 
was 13 years old.
The 24-year-old already knew how to play piano at 
the time, but his guitar quickly became special to him.
“I could compose music. I could play out what I was 
feeling without having to sing,” Rodriguez said. “It was 
a spiritual thing to me.”
After nearly a decade of practice, Rodriguez won 
KISS 105.3’s Sunday night talent show, landing him and nine other finalists front-of-the-line passes to audition for “America’s Got Talent” in Tampa — an opportunity that could slingshot his music career.
Dozens of ambitious performers joined Rodriguez 
at the Hilton UF Conference Center from 5 to 8 p.m., in 
hopes of winning the audition-line passes and $105.30.
Musicians, poets and comedians performed 90-sec-ond acts in front of KISS radio judges and a room full of 
contestants, friends and family members.
Musical performances included covers for songs like 
“All About that Bass” by contestant Madeline Smith and “Too Close” by contestant Megan Knutson. Stanton Johnson, 19, played his original song “For the Night,” 
and Kidcross played his own song, “Ready or Not.”
The Tampa auditions for the national competition 
will take place Nov. 2.
KISS 105.3’s morning show host, Brett Douglas, in-
troduced each of the acts and said he had “huge respect 
for them for just showing up.”
Of the 10 finalists, all were musicians except for Pres-
ton Higgs — a dancer. Throughout the last few years, Higgs said he taught himself everything he knows.
“I saw people on the Internet, and I was like, ‘I can 
do that!’” he said.
Three years after he started dancing, he’s now on his 
way to Tampa.Radio station hosts talent show“It’s not ideal for prices to

the new president-elect, Kent Fuchs?Today’s question: Did you go to any Homecoming 
events this weekend?Looking other way will not end racism 
Last week, Nick Eagle wrote a column in which he ar-gued we should all “just be proud to be Americans.” Although Eagle’s proposal is a noble one, it is rooted in 
misconceptions and ignorance.
I’m not blind to the social issues that face our country and 
the work we must do to better this great nation.
Eagle admits that “problems still exist among races, sex-
ual orientations” and other demographic groups. However, 
his proposed solution of just overlooking everything wrong 
with our society and pretending there are no issues is simply 
unrealistic. Ignoring our country’s many social problems in the name of patriotism is like putting a Band-Aid on a wound that requires stitches.
Eagle claims to love “living in a country where we are not 
persecuted for being who we are.” I think it’s safe to say there are many Americans wondering which country he is refer-ring to because it certainly isn’t the U.S.
For many years, American society was rife with the mar-
ginalization and oppression of numerous communities — overt discrimination, in many instances. I won’t review this oppression in detail because the privilege of certain groups over others throughout American history is widely under-stood and accepted.
Although discrimination isn’t as overt as it once was, 
there’s no doubt that discrimination, prejudice and injustice all still exist on interpersonal, cultural and institutional lev-els. Millions of “proud Americans” have to deal with both 
the effects of discrimination occurring today and the resid-
ual effects of past discrimination. Many U.S. citizens are still ﬁ  ghting for their shot at the American dream, an aspiration 59 percent now believe is impossible for most to achieve.
The reason they feel that way is because instead of ad-
dressing the problems we face, many would rather ignore those issues — like addressing what is wrong would only perpetuate the ills. There is a fallacy in this thought process.
If a car has a ﬂ  at tire, would you ignore it, refuse to talk 
about it and hope that continuing to operate the car with a ﬂ  at tire would solve the problem? Of course not. Unfortunately, there are people who believe this look-the-other-way mental-ity is the proper way to handle our society’s problems.Beverly Tatum, president of 
Spelman College, developed an apt metaphor for the status of rela-tions in the U.S., particularly with regard to race: Imagine a moving 
walkway in an airport always 
moving in the direction of racial inequality. We are all placed on that walkway.
An overt racist is someone run-
ning along the walkway. There substantially fewer runners than there were in past years, and that is why so many choose to believe we no longer have to ﬁ  ght for racial justice.
Someone standing still on the walkway is still moving 
toward racial inequality. This reﬂ  ects the fundamentally op-pressive nature of the society we live in today. This is the position advocated for in Eagle’s column: overlooking all of America’s social and racial problems. 
However, those in this country who are being oppressed 
and choose to ﬁ  ght against their oppression see the issue dif-ferently. They realize by accepting their fate and doing noth-ing, injustice is perpetuated, and their situations will never improve.
If you want to be part of the solution, you have to decide 
to turn around on the walkway and walk in the opposite direction — you must stand against racism and discrimina-tion. You have to actively work against the system of racial injustice. It requires more work than standing still, but it is the only way to ever move toward a society that embodies true equality.
This principle holds for all forms of oppression, not just 
racism. We must address these issues and work together to 
battle inequality so we can all truly be proud Americans. Sit-
ting around and waiting on things to get better on their own is not a real answer.
We must realize America’s future leaders will be those 
proud enough to say: “I love America, but we still have work to do.”

conference masks 
public health cuts
Gov. Rick Scott held a press conference Friday to discuss the recent Ebola cases in Texas. Fears about an outbreak in Florida were heightened after a plane carrying one of 
the nurses diagnosed with Ebola stopped at the Fort Lauder-dale-Hollywood International Airport. 
Although health care experts assert that the risk of Ebola 
spreading to Florida is miniscule, Scott has repeatedly stated his commitment to ensuring that the state is fully prepared in case Ebola somehow strikes. 
“The CDC and the federal government have already failed 
to get ahead of the spread of Ebola in Texas, and we’re not go-ing to let that happen in Florida,” Scott said. 
Although it is important to be sure that Florida is prepared 
for any disease outbreak, public health has not been a priority 
of the Scott administration until now.
According to the American Public Health Association, Flor-
ida spent about $20 per capita on public health in 2013, which 
ranked No. 31 in the nation. The Sunshine State receives about $16 per capita in public health funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, No. 45 among all states. 
The APHA also found that Florida had the fourth-highest 
level of people without insurance in the U.S. last year at nearly 20 percent. The national uninsured rate is 15.7 percent. 
A USA Today report found that Florida slashed its public 
health budget by 15.5 percent in 2012. When Jacksonville ex-perienced an outbreak of tuberculosis that same year, Scott’s massive cuts to the Florida Department of Health budget were blamed for the state’s slow response.
Scott also has a mixed track record on one of the most im-
portant health care issues of recent years: the Medicaid expan-sion provided by the federal Affordable Care Act.
Throughout the early days of his administration, Scott force-
fully opposed the Medicaid expansion, which would have pro-vided hundreds of thousands of poor and disabled Floridians with access to affordable health care. The governor initially claimed that the expansion would be too costly, despite the fact that the federal government would cover more than 90 percent of the program’s costs.
Although Scott later expressed support for a limited Med-
icaid expansion, he made no effort to revive the issue after the Florida Legislature rejected the proposal.
Scott’s decision to prioritize Ebola is less likely about a sin-
cere concern for public health and more likely a strategic deci-sion to take advantage of a hot-button political issue.
“He’s playing politics with fear,” said Nova Southeastern 
University professor Charles Zelden, according to the Tampa Bay Times. “He’s following the Republican Party playbook, which is to scare people into voting.”
If Scott is truly concerned about disease prevention in Flor-
ida, he should commit to strengthening Florida’s public health programs permanently, not just when it is politically expedi-ent.MONDAY, OCTOBER 20, 2014

Every few months, a new issue takes prominence on 
the political scene, and most people quickly embrace a solution before considering any of its consequenc-
es. The latest political trend to gain popular support has been increasing minimum wage from its current federal 
rate of $7.25 an hour to $10.10 per hour. Supporters of a 
minimum wage increase often frame such a proposal as a cure-all for what ails the U.S. economy.
A CBS News/The New 
York Times poll from Septem-ber shows more than 70 percent of people are in favor of raising minimum wage to such high levels. I believe this support stems largely from the fact 
that most people aren’t educated about the consequences 
of such a policy.
Raising the minimum wage sounds good in theory. 
However, the facts simply don’t back up the supposed benefits.
First, let’s just look at how many people actually make 
minimum wage. According to the Bureau of Labor Statis-tics, only 4.3 percent of hourly workers make minimum wage or less, and most of them tend to be teenagers and 
part-time workers. In total, about 1.5 million people across 
the U.S. make minimum wage. When you include work-ers who make less than minimum wage — mostly those who earn the tipped wage rate — 3.3 million people earn minimum wage or less.
Now, if you do simple math, a task that seems diffi-
cult for most of our politicians, you will find that less than 2 percent of civilians in the labor force earn minimum wage.
So how in the world would raising minimum wage to 
$10.10 fix our economy and combat poverty? Simply put, it won’t. When you raise minimum wage, those making minimum wage get a pay increase, but nobody else does. What will happen is businesses that have to increase their employees’ wages by 39 percent will have to increase their prices at nearly the same rate. Those who get a raise end up with pretty much the same purchasing power now that things are more expensive, and those of us who don’t get 
a raise are less able to buy the same amount of goods and 
services as before. When minimum wage is increased, a fraction of the working population remains unaffected, while 98 percent of people become worse off.
The only effects of minimum wage are economic inef-
ficiencies, job loss and reduced job variance. Minimum wage acts as a price floor, making less skilled workers ar-tificially more expensive, which in turn, lessens their bar-gaining power and makes it harder to find work.
Let’s not put up with it. Let’s get rid of minimum 
wage.
That’s not a typo. Let’s end the restraints that come 
with minimum wage.
No, it would not lead to massive poverty. Even now, 
those who make minimum wage and are full time do not fall below the federal poverty threshold. No, it would not lead to people making $2 an hour. Who in the world would work for $2 an hour? Nobody. Employees will negotiate 
with their employers until a fair wage for the amount of 
skill involved is reached. Wages would start to align more with the natural order of labor demand and supply.
All the horrors people say would come with the re-
moval of federal minimum wage would never come to fruition. What did people do before minimum wage? They got paid a fair wage for the work they performed, and industries competed for workers.
Most people will not take the hard stance of completely 
eliminating minimum wage, and that’s fine. But before supporting minimum wage, especially such a large in-crease that is being advocated by politicians like Florida Democratic nominee Gov. Charlie Crist, research the ac-tual facts about the effects of such a policy. Whenever poli-ticians support a policy they claim will have such unam-biguously positive effects, there is reason to be skeptical. Remember: If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.

minimum wage myths this electionColumn
It’s a leisurely Sunday afternoon. You turn on the TV to 
watch some athletic men toss around a football. While most of what you watch is about the game, it’s undeni-
able that you will be exposed to the religious affiliations of select players.
Just as a player scores a touchdown, you also get to find 
out if they believe in heaven and hell as they go down to the ground to praise the Christian God.
But wait — a challenger appears. Husain Abdullah, safety 
for the Kansas City Chiefs, scored a touchdown Sept. 29 from an interception return thrown by Tom Brady. Abdullah im-mediately slid to his knees and prayed to Allah in celebra-tion. Non-Christian prayer? Scandalous. 
The referees threw a flag at Abdullah, giving him a 15-
yard penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct. In the coming days, those representing the NFL acted less like profession-als working for a multi-million dollar organization and more like disagreeing parents, saying to Abdullah and the masses, “I’m right. You’re wrong. End of story.” 
Ready for the parental bickering?The next day, the NFL stated that the penalty against 
Abdullah was incorrect. According to a statement issued by NFL spokesman Michael Signora, “the officiating mechanic 
in this situation is not to flag a player who goes to the ground 
as part of religious expression, and as a result, there should have been no penalty on the play.”
Problem solved. Islamic displays are cool on the field. Hold up, parent No. 1, I’m confused. Parent No. 2, the 
NFL rulebook, says nothing about religion. Instead, it states, “Players are prohibited from engaging in any celebrations while on the ground.”
Then again, parent No. 1 issued an official statement after the game. They must be right.
Stop everything, parents No. 1 
and 2 — parent No. 3, the NFL Ref-erees Association, said that this was the correct call on Oct. 3. 
Alright, parents No. 1, 2 and 3: I 
don’t understand if this display was correct or incorrect, but what about all of those other religious (Christian) players? 
Tim Tebow wasn’t the only one. Multiple NFL players 
have gotten down on one knee to praise the Christian God during games — James Jones, formerly of the Green Bay Packers; Nate Washington of the Tennessee Titans and Do-menik Hixon of the New York Giants, to name a few — with no penalty. 
Maybe the distinction lies in the number of legs touching 
the ground. Knelt on one knee praising the Christian God? A triumphant moment. Two knees? Preposterous.
NFL parents No. 1, 2 and 3 provide an inconsistent com-
mentary of “I’m right,” regarding religious practices during an NFL game.
Abdullah ended up siding with parent No. 3, agreeing 
that it was his two-knee slide into the praying position that caused the penalty, not his religious display. 
These three disagreeing parents need to get together and 
decide on one concrete rule to tell their children,  NFL teams and players, rather than arguing back and forth with conflict-ing ideas that are all considered “correct.” 
Bottom line: The NFL needs to form concrete boundaries 
regarding religious displays. Beyond religion, let’s just find out a solid answer regarding proper celebration.

Gainesville’s alternative,

need of volunteers.
The Fest 13 is having its 
last volunteer sign-up meeting 
tonight at the Holiday Inn on 
University Avenue at 7 p.m. The Halloween-weekend fes-tival is almost entirely run by volunteers and needs at least 75 more helping hands to check wristbands at doors, load bands on and off stages and more.
“If we don’t get this, we 
will have to trim,” said Tony Weinbender, Fest’s organizer. “We’re going to have less man-power, womanpower, people-power — that will seriously af-fect smaller venues drastically 
who have come to rely during 
this crazy time of Fest on a team of five volunteers.”
Volunteers work a single 
shift of five to seven hours in exchange for a pass and a T-shirt. Introducing Bo Diddley Community Plaza as a venue created about extra 150 spots.
Ricky Marrero volunteered 
at Fest the past two years. He’s been an assistant stage man-ager at The Wooly and a stage manager.
“I like feeling included in 
the show, like I helped in some way to make it work,” he said. “It’s definitely a confidence 
booster. Plus, the free wrist-
band isn’t bad.”Local music festival

Jonique Simmons almost didn’t come to UF.
Although she had been accepted, Simmons said she 
had no way of covering the costs. That’s when the Ma-chen Florida Opportunity Scholars Program stepped in to help her.
“When I found out I got FOS, it just changed my 
whole life,” the UF sport management freshman said.
President Bernie Machen created the Machen Florida 
Opportunity Scholars Program in 2005. The program provides full grant and scholarship packages to first-generation college students at UF. Between 2012 and 2013, the program received more than $12 million to fund students, according to the program’s website.
“He paved the way for a lot of students to come to the 
University of Florida,” Simmons, 18, said. “He just gave us the opportunity to achieve our dreams.”
With Machen’s time at UF almost over, students like 
Alexa Tsongranis said they are sad to see him go.
Tsongranis, a UF psychology and advertising junior, 
said Machen felt like a friend to the scholars.
“Not only is he the reason I’m at this school, FOS has 
kept me at this school,” Tsongranis, 21, said.
According to the program’s website, the program has 
supported more than 2,900 students since 2006.
Machen made sure he was accessible and visible to 
the program’s students, said Leslie Pendleton, the pro-gram director.
“Any opportunity he had, he would attend events 
we hosted,” Pendleton said. “He really loved the pro-
gram, and he is very beloved by the students.”
Machen attended the Florida Opportunity Scholars 
Program reception in September and took individual 
photos with all 300 scholars.
“It really showed how much he appreciated us and 
how much he cared about our future,” Simmons said.
While the program’s students are sad to see Machen 
go, they said they are excited to see how incoming Presi-dent Kent Fuchs will move forward with the program.
“The program we have is so beneficial and creates so 
many opportunities for students,” said Liza Allison, a 21-year-old UF tourism, events and recreation manage-
ment junior. “If he doesn’t know that yet, he will know 
it. There’s no need to change it in any way unless to bet-ter it.”
Florida Opportunity Scholar and public relations se-
nior Agassy Rodriguez said he was rooting for Fuchs.
“I hope he continues that tradition of being open with 
the students, even though he wasn’t the one who created the scholarship,” the 21-year-old said.Students grateful for Machen program

UF golf in top 10 at Orlando tournament
After one round at the Tavistock Collegiate Invitational, 
the UF men’s golf team is tied for ninth place after shooting a 1-under 287 on Sunday.UF tennis sophomore Maxx Lipman reached the semiﬁ  nals at the USTA/ITA Regionals. Read more at alligatorSports.org.JORDAN MCPHERSON
Alligator Staff Writer

In the debacle that was 
Florida’s 42-13 homecoming 
loss to Missouri on Saturday, 
one thing was certain: UF’s de-
fense did not lose the football game.
The Gators (3-3, 2-3 South-
eastern Conference) limited the Tigers (5-2, 2-1 SEC) to just 119 yards and 13 points on of-fense — a ﬁ  ve-yard rushing touchdown by running back 
Marcus Murphy and a pair of 
ﬁ  eld goals by Andrew Bag-gett.
“Defensively, I thought our 
kids played well enough to win the game. Bottom line,” coach Will Muschamp said. “They didn’t have to do much, and they ﬁ  gured that out pret-
ty quickly after it got to be 
about 28-0.”
This was the second time 
Muschamp saw his team limit 
an opponent to less than 120 
yards of offense in a game.
It’s also the second time the 
Gators lost while holding an opponent to under 120 yards 
of total offense as Florida State 
defeated Florida 21-7 on Nov. 26, 2011, despite gaining just 95 yards on offense.
“They get to a point with 
the score they don’t have to stretch themselves very much with what they’re trying to do offensively,” Muschamp said. 
“That’s two fold. But again, it’s a team game.”
The rest of Missouri’s points 
on Saturday came on a quartet 
of special teams and defensive touchdowns.
Murphy returned the open-
ing kickoff 96 yards and re-
turned Kyle Christy’s ﬁ  rst 
punt in the second half 82 yards to break Missouri’s combined returns touchdown record with seven in his career (three kickoff returns, four 
punt returns).
“The punt return was a 
dagger,” Muschamp said. 
“That hurt in essence from the standpoint that it changed the 
game.”
In the third quarter with 
the Gators facing a third-and-9 
from their 33-yard line, Ti-gers defensive end Shane Ray strip-sacked Florida quarter-
back Jeff Driskel, and Missouri 
defensive end Markus Golden scooped it up and returned it for a 21-yard touchdown to ex-tend its lead to 35-0.
One drive later, Driskel 
threw an interception — his fourth turnover of the game

In a battle to stay undefeated in 
the Southeastern Conference, No. 8 
Florida volleyball swept unranked 
Arkansas in one of the Gators’ most 
highly contested matches of the sea-son.
Florida (14-3, 8-0 SEC) faced its 
biggest challenge in conference play yet against Arkansas (9-5, 5-2 SEC): a strong offensive team.
Throughout conference play this 
season, Florida has held its oppo-
nents to just under a .200 hitting 
clip.
That changed on Sunday.Arkansas came out in the ﬁ  rst set 
with a .065 hitting clip, but altered its attack in the second (.324) and third (.296) sets.
While the Gators swept the Ra-
zorbacks — marking the sixth SEC 
team in just eight conference games 
that Florida has swept so far — the win didn’t come easily for Florida.
“They’re (Arkansas) just not a 
roll over type team,” coach Mary 
Wise said. 
“What happened right away 
was they made their run. They 
made some changes, they’re a well-
coached team.”
Florida remained dominant in 
its offensive play with freshman 
Rhamat Alhassan leading the Gators with 11 kills on 13 attempts with a 
.846 attacking clip – a career high – 
and one service ace.
Alhassan also offered four block 
assists and one dig for the day.
The middle blocker went into Ar-
kansas after having a tough match at South Carolina on Wednesday.
She ﬁ  nished against the Game-
cocks with ﬁ  ve kills on 16 attempts 
with six errors, leaving her with a 
-.062 hitting clip.
“Wednesday wasn’t my best 
night, but I just moved on,” Alhas-
san said. 
“I don’t dwell on the past. We’re UF sweeps

Last week, I told read-
ers after Florida’s 30-27 loss to LSU at home 
that Will Muschamp was on thin ice. Florida had two loss-es on the season but still had a chance to make it to Atlanta for the Southeastern Confer-ence Championship. 
But after Florida’s 42-13 
homecoming blowout to Mis-
souri on Saturday night, it’s probably safe 
to say Muschamp is a dead man walking. 
The Gators came into the game as ﬁ  ve-
and-a-half point favorites, and Missouri 
entered with a defeat to Indiana at home and a 34-0 loss to Georgia the week prior.
When Missouri’s Marcus Murphy took the opening kickoff 96 yards for a touchdown, it was clear-ly a sign of things to come. 
In the week leading up to 
the game, Muschamp said the 
coaching staff would go with 
the quarterback who had the “hot hand” in the game, but it was presumed Jeff Driskel would start over true fresh-man Treon Harris. 
Driskel did start and fumbled on the 
exchange during a handoff to Matt Jones on the opening Florida possession.
Driskel came back out on the next se-
ries.
He threw four incompletions. Harris made his debut on the third 
series, but on third down he was sacked and fumbled, allowing Missouri to go up 14-0. 
Driskel’s next possession ended three-
and-out, and the possession following that he threw an interception on ﬁ  rst down. 
Florida was down 20-0 at halftime. On homecoming. The boo birds were seemingly ﬂ  ying 
from the alumni section all evening, and the second half was just as ugly as the ﬁ  rst, featuring a Missouri punt return for a touchdown, a Driskel fumble for a touchdown and even a Driskel pick-six. 
Perhaps the one bright spot was Har-
ris leading two touchdown drives, but he threw an interception in between those two. 
Mistakes aplenty in Florida’s homecoming lossGators defense holds its own in loss to Tigers

always thinking about the next thing, 
what’s coming up next and that’s just how I look at it.”
While Alhassan helped Florida offen-
sively, setter Mackenzie Dagostino had to 
make quick plays to 
keep the Gators’ of-
fense moving.Dagostino finished the match with only 
35 assists but had two service aces, two 
block assists and one dig on the day. 
On paper, the Tampa native didn’t 
produce the huge numbers she’s typically 
known for. But off paper, she put together lengthy plays that allowed Florida to hold onto its momentum.
“It’s not fun to come in and roll through 
teams and having someone like Arkansas who fights back, like we bite them they 
bite back,” Dagostino said. “It makes the 
game what the game is supposed to be 
like. It makes us that much better because 
if you don’t have to work for your kills, if you don’t have to find different areas to put the ball down on their side of the court, then it doesn’t make you a better player. You just do the same exact thing over and over again.”With the loss to Missouri and 
the SEC East title hopes virtually 
out the window, the wheels have fallen off the Muschamp wagon.
“It falls on my shoulders,” 
Muschamp said. “Nobody’s look-ing around right now, we’ve got to get back and get our guys di-aled back in.”
Getting the players dialed 
back in is much easier said than done. 
The goal Florida set out to 
achieve — winning the SEC East 
— is gone barring major upsets 
happening within the division in the next few weeks, which is unlikely.
“Now not putting the destiny 
in our hands any more, we’ve got to rely on some other teams,” center Max Garcia said. “But we’re still going to fight. We’ve 
still got three more SEC games in 
the East.”
While it is true that they still 
have three games remaining — Georgia, Vanderbilt and South Carolina — Florida lost to all three of those teams last season by a combined 26 points. 
It wasn’t even the Florida de-
fense that was to blame for the 42 point loss. 
The unit held Missouri to just 
119 total yards of offense on Sat-urday night. 
Yes, 119 yards and 42 points, 
you read that correctly. 
An even more glaring statis-
tic regarding that number: Mus-
champ is 0-2 when allowing 120 
total yards or fewer. 
Compare that to other FBS 
head coaches? 94-0. 
Over the past 10 seasons all 
other FBS head coaches are 94-0 when holding opponents to 120 total yards or less. 
Florida football deserves high-
er standards.
I don’t know if Jeremy Foley 
has seen that statistic. You’d hope someone found a way to slip it to him. 
Even if he hasn’t seen it, see-
ing the 42-13 homecoming loss should be enough. It’s time for the sun to set on the Muschamp 
era in Gainesville. 
When exactly that will happen 
remains to be seen.MONDAY, OCTOBER 20, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15

and Florida’s season-high sixth 
giveaway — to Missouri lineback-er Darvin Ruise, who returned it 
46 yards for the score.
“We had something going in 
the second half there, but offen-
sively, just abysmal,” Muschamp 
said. “No rhythm and we’ve got to 
figure out what we can do to try and move the football. Six turn-overs. That’s hard to overcome.”
Safety Keanu Neal — who re-
corded a career-high 10 tackles in the loss — said the game was frus-trating, but the frustration is not going to stop them from playing 
at a high intensity.
“As a defense we tell our-
selves to control the controllable 
and what happens on the offen-sive side we can’t control,” Neal 
said. “Whenever we get a sudden 
change like that, we get excited to go out there and play football.”
And while Muschamp praised 
the defense for its performance, he said the unit could have still done more to change the momentum of the game.
“We could have created some 
turnovers on defense, we had some opportunities,” Muschamp said. “Marcus (Maye) made a nice play on an interception. Strip the 
ball off  somebody, make a play. 
That’s our mentality. We don’t 
get into the pointing fingers stuff. We’re not going to do that.”Neal had

After a last-minute loss to South Caroli-
na on Thursday night, No. 5 Florida (11-4, 
6-2 Southeastern Conference) dropped its second straight game — and fourth of the season — on Sunday in Lexington, Ky., losing 2-0 to Kentucky (10-5, 5-3 SEC).
The Wildcats played a very physical 
game against the Gators, and although UF 
coach Becky Burleigh said the team ex-pected it coming into the match, the team 
didn’t handle it well.
From the game’s ﬁ  rst minute, Florida 
struggled to keep the ball and never got in rhythm. 
Kentucky pressured players with the 
ball and didn’t allow the Gators to build any attacks of signiﬁ  cant danger.
The Wildcats got on the board in the 
33rd minute from a Zoe Swift goal, her fourth of the season, and took the one-goal lead into halftime.Florida may have had a 
more effective game plan for the second half, but it never got a chance to ﬁ  nd out. The Wildcats added a second goal in the 50th minute from Stuart Pope, 
who put a rebound from a diving Taylor Burke save 
in the back of the net. 
Burleigh called the goal a “backbreak-
er.”From that point, the Wildcats locked 
down defensively and prevented the 
Gators from getting anywhere near the penalty box, holding  Florida to only two shots for the entire second half.
Florida’s players began getting desper-
ate and started trying to make plays in-dividually, Burleigh said, which caused them to play out of character.

Firing Muschamp during season doesn’t bring beneﬁ  ts to team
doing that already? Foley has said 
that he — like any competent AD — has a list of potential candidates in his desk at all times. If a coaching search is coming, do you really want 
it to drag on for two months?
Coaches not named Bobby Petri-
no don’t often jump ship midseason. 
Dan Mullen, the coach de jour right now because of his blatant connec-
tion to offense and UF, has bigger 
ﬁ  sh to fry than Florida at this point in his season.  As do most of the oth-er head coaching candidates you can drum up in your head at this point.
The fact of the matter is Florida is 
still a destination job no matter what because of what the program is, where the program is, the conference 
that it plays in and the market value 
that it has. Foley has Muschamp at a bargain price as far as SEC coaches 
go, and Florida can make the big ﬁ  sh 
say no to them after the season, Fo-ley isn’t banging on anyone’s door right now to ask.
Firing Muschamp just gives you 
the ﬁ  nality you want for the impa-tience you feel. You want something done — anything done 
If you ﬁ  re Muschamp now, you 
run the risk of having a team com-pletely check out. Sure, they could rally around Muschamp and have a 
profound moment built for a 30 for 
30 documentary, or they could com-pletely tank and take a bad season and send it even farther south.
Firing Muschamp during the 
season appeases you. It doesn’t ap-pease recruits who will now have more time to be able to be poached by other schools because Florida still 
won’t get a coach by the middle of 
December at the extreme earliest. It doesn’t appease potential 
coaching prospects for the job, and it doesn’t appease the other coaches of the other sports here at UF that Foley must answer to.
I ask for patience, even though 
you probably don’t have any left. It will get better around here, but I don’t think ﬁ  ring Muschamp in the thick of the season will turn this ship 
around, it’ll just give you a peace of 
mind.

3 KEY PLAYS
 SWAMP STUDS
Marcus Murphy opened up the game 
with a bang. The Missouri senior running 
back returned the opening kickoff 96 
yards for a touchdown to give the Tigers 
a 7-0 lead just 11 seconds into the 
game.
KEY STAT: 6
This stat is three-fold. Six is the number of 
sacks Florida’s offensive line surrendered 
against Missouri — one more than it gave up all 
season heading into this game. It’s the number 
of turnovers the Gators had on offense. And it’s 
the number of drives quarterback Treon Harris 
started on Saturday.

TURNING POINT
Missouri essentially capped the game early in 
the third quarter. After Florida stalled on its first 
second-half possession, Tigers running back 
Marcus Murphy returned a Kyle Christy punt 82 
yards to give Missouri a four-possession lead.
Neal was a bright spot 
for Florida’s defense on 
Saturday. The sophomore 
recorded a career-high 10 
total tackles against Mis
 -
souri and leads the Gators 
with 17 solo stops on the season.
Darvin Ruise finished the scoring for 
Missouri. With the Tigers up 35-0 with 
a little more than six minutes left in the 
third quarter, Ruise intercepted a Jeff 
Driskel pass and returned it 46 yards to 
the endzone.
While Florida’s offense 
struggled to do just about 
anything against Missouri 
for the bulk of the game, 
Harris led the Gators to 
two scoring drives. The 
true freshman finished the 
game against Missouri with 98 passing yards and 
26 rushing yards.
On the Gators’ last drive, trailing 42-7, 
Treon Harris showed he has the capabili
 -
ty to lead UF’s offense. With Harris at the 
helm, Florida marched down the field for 
a 15-play, 82-yard drive that was capped 
by a Harris 3-yard touchdown run.

self. The tight end caught a 
five-yard pass from Harris 
in the endzone, which allowed the Gators to avoid 
their first shutout since 1988.
