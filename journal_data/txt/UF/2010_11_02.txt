Amateur zombie hunters will have 
to stow their Nerf guns and dirty socks 
until spring. 
This week’s Humans vs. Zombies 
game has been canceled. 
According to Jesse Schmitt, presi-
dent of Gators Humans vs. Zombies, he was contacted early last week by UF officials from the Office of Risk Man-agement and the Center for Student Activities and Involvement who were concerned about insurance liability is-
sues because some participants are not 
UF students. 
These participants would not be covered by UF’s insurance policy in the event of an injury or other accident. 
Schmitt said that the game usually 
draws some outside participants, espe-cially from nearby Santa Fe College. 
“The way the system is currently set 
up, I can’t control that,” Schmitt said. 
Humans vs. Zombies already re-
quires participants to sign a liability 
waiver, but Schmitt said he was told 
that this waiver could not cover outside participants. 
Because Schmitt was unaware of 
the university’s policy, he said, he was unable to find a policy in time for the game and decided to postpone it until the spring. 
Beth Waltrip, director of campus 
programs in the Center for Student Ac-tivities and Involvement, said the event is unusual because it involves undeter -
mined numbers of outside participants over a period of several days. 
“If they invited non-students last 
time, we were unaware,” Waltrip said.
Schmitt said he regrets canceling the 
game but still hopes to break the world record of 1,537 participants in the next game. 
“I apologize, personally, and I hope 
everyone comes out for spring because we’re still going for the world record.”
Police: Man robbed bank then offered $1,000 for ride
CAPITOLA, Calif. — Police say a bank 
robber forgot to set up a getaway ride, so 
he offered $1,000 to people on the street for a lift after the heist. Capitola police said a man in his 40s or 50s entered a bank at 11:40 a.m. on Saturday and ordered $20 and $100 bills from the teller.
Police said the man then jumped onto 
the counter, pushed the teller and grabbed money from the till. They did not say how much money he took.About a block from the bank, witnesses 
told investigators that a man was offering $1,000 to anyone who would give him a ride to Santa Cruz.
The California Highway Patrol, Santa 
Cruz police and Capitola police searched for the suspect, but have not found him.
Police believe is a transient, and are 
looking to interview anyone who may have given him a ride.

Día de los Muertos
Students from the Institute of Hispanic-Latino Cultures on West University Avenue stand in a mock graveyard 
erected in honor of Día de los Muertos, or Day of the Dead, on Monday. Students celebrated the holiday, which traditionally takes place in a graveyard, by eating Mexican food, decorating the center with plastic skulls and paying respects to friends and family who have died.
Students on campus have the polls brought to them.
Three polling locations have been set up across cam-
pus for students to vote in Tuesday’s elections. 
The polls will be set up at the Reitz  Union, the Phil-
lips Center for the Performing Arts and the Days Inn 
on Southwest 13th Street, said Pam Carpenter, Alachua County supervisor of elections.
Polling locations can be found on your voter registra-
tion cards or at maps.google.com/vote.
The polls will be open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Students 
must present a photo and signature ID at the precincts. 
The UF College Democrats will have a table set up 
in front of the Reitz Union Colonnade from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. Students who need rides to polling locations can be escorted by one of five on-call College Democrat drivers.  The UF College Republicans will not be offering rides on campus. The group will be around campus promoting Republican candidates.

� CREATORS HOPE TO EXPOSE 
INTERNET INSECURITY.
By MICHAEL RAMIREZ 
Alligator Contributing Writer
A new Firefox application allows anyone 
on a network to take control of your Internet identity over a wireless network — even on campus.
Eric Butler, a freelance web application and 
software developer from Seattle, released the extension for Mozilla’s Firefox browser last week called “Firesheep.” It allows complete access to Internet accounts of popular web-sites, like Facebook or Gmail, of anyone on a shared wireless network.  
The extension was created and released 
to force companies like Amazon, Facebook, 
Google and Twitter into increasing their secu-
rity. The free extension is simple to use, with a one button interface, and is available for Fire-fox on Windows and Mac OS X computers, ac-
cording to Butler’s blog.
Kevin Johnson, a security consultant 
with Secure Ideas, is excited about tools like 
Firesheep because of the attention it brings to how unsecure the Internet can be. 
“We’ve known about this for years.” 
Firesheep works by “sniffing” your “cook-
ies” —  saved information that allows a web-
site to recognize who you are. The website and your computer exchange a personalized 
cookie which you show to access other parts of the website. 
Firesheep exposes the cookies of users on a 
network. Even those on secure networks, like 
UF’s wireless network, are vulnerable.
“Think of it as a key ,” Johnson said. “You 
need your dorm key to get into your dorm.”
The real problem, which Butler is exploit-
ing with Firesheep, is these websites are only encrypted while you log in to your account. 
Once you’re logged in, the website stops en-
crypting, you’ll notice the “s” disappear from 
“https://” in your browser’s address bar, and 
you’re no longer secured. 
At this point, anyone can use your cookie to 
access your account. The only thing Facebook or Google would have to do to fix this problem 
is not switch back to “http,” John-son said.
Facebook issued a statement on 
Wednesday, which said a more se-
cure option of accessing Facebook will be pro-
vided as an option in the coming months.
While Google has secured its e-mail service, 
Gmail, a Firesheep user can still read e-mails. 
Once a user leaves the page and looks at vid-
eos or does a search, they are no longer secure 
and someone can get access, Johnson said.
There are a couple of solutions to the prob-
lem besides waiting for support from unsecure 
websites. The Electronic Frontier Foundation 
has its own extension that forces websites to 
use “https” rather than “http.” But the exten-
sion isn’t supported by all websites and will notify you when you’re browsing an unsecure 
page, Johnson said.Browser plugin lets users

All of the tee times were booked on 
the first day of golf at the renovated 
Ironwood municipal golf course. 
The course, located at 2100 NE 39th 
Ave., had closed in March to undergo 
an extensive seven-month renovation, which cost more than $1 million. 
The changes include reconstruction 
of the greens, which are now built to the United States Golf Association’s speci-fications, a new Toro irrigation system, and a complete paint job on the Iron-
wood clubhouse.
City spokesman Bob Woods said af-
ter a hard rain parts of the course would 
flood before the reconstruction. 
“We lost a lot of golf days because 
of the poor drainage system. Part of this 
project was to solve that,” he said.
However, the renovation project has 
also been a source of controversy. Ac-
cording to a report released by the City 
of Gainesville Department of Parks, 
Recreation & Cultural Affairs in March, 
the project cost $1,267,500. The money came from city bonds. 
Opponents of the renovation, such 
as Don Marsh, a candidate for City Commission who also lost the mayor seat to Craig Lowe, viewed the project as a waste of taxpayer money . 
While Marsh declined to speak to 
the Alligator directly on the topic, he 
has strongly voiced his opinions on his 
website’s blog.
“City commissioners insisted on 
keeping Iron Wood Golf Course, even 
though it is projected 
to lose $300,000 per year,” Marsh said in 
an Aug. 17 blog post. “They can just keep raising your electric 
and water bills be-
cause they will need 
more and more mon-ey transferred to the 
general fund from GRU.”
According to the Department of 
Parks, Recreation & Cultural Affairs, the bonds will be repaid by patrons over 20 years, with a $5-per-round fee.
“No improvements have been done 
to the golf course since the city acquired 
it in the 1980s,” Woods said. “While a 
few individuals may have concerns, the 
City Commission felt this was right for the community, and all citizens now have a golf course to be proud of.”Taxpayer-funded golf

Kal Penn, an actor from movies like “Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle” and “Harold & Kumar Escape from Guan -
tanamo Bay,” talks about the importance of voting to a crowd on the Reitz Union Colonnade on Monday.
� HE SUGGESTED TAKING FRIENDS TO THE POLLS.
By JERRY BRUNO
Alligator Contributing Writer
Instead of making a trip to White Castle, Kal Penn spent his 
part of his morning at the Reitz Union, encouraging students 
to vote. 
Penn, an actor known for his roles on “House” and in “Har -
old & Kumar Go to White Castle,” spoke to a crowd of about 90 
people on the Reitz Union Colonnade Monday morning about 
the importance of supporting democratic candidates in this week’s election. 
Penn shared personal stories of why he is involved in the 
political process.
“I am involved because I have gay buddies in the military 
who want to serve openly and freely ,” he said.  
Penn urged the crowd that when they vote, they should take 
five friends with them, and those five friends should take five 
friends with them, as well. 
Even though Penn is registered as an Independent, he be-
lieves in supporting President Barack Obama’s agenda.   
“If we want to move the country forward, we have to vote 
for Democratic candidates,” he said. 
Penn reminded the crowd that because of the victory in 2008, 
comprehensive health care was passed, friends in Iraq started 
coming home and groundbreaking student loan and financial aid reforms helped make sure students can afford college.  
Kristin Klein, president of UF College Democrats, which 
hosted the event, said she wants students to know that this elec-tion is just as important as two years ago.

A Gainesville man was arrested Sat-
urday after swallowing marijuana and 
having a stolen gun in his possession.
At about 11:45 p.m., Gainesville 
Police Officer Daniel Abbott saw a 
black Mazda in the parking lot of T.B McPherson park.
According to the GPD arrest report, 
when Abbott spoke with the driver and passenger, he said he smelled burnt marijuana coming from the car.
Abbott asked the man in the pas-
senger side several questions, and although he wasn’t answering, he swallowed several times. After Ab-bott asked him to get out of the car, 
he found a small bag filled with about 
two grams of marijuana in the car door compartment.
The passenger was identified as An-
thony Ramsey, 25.
When he asked why he was being 
arrested, Abbott saw pieces of marijua-
na stuck in his bottom teeth and the inside of his cheek.
Abbott also found 
a .45 caliber pistol under Ramsey’s seat, and a weapons search 
revealed that it was 
stolen out of Marion 
County. Abbott also has eight previous 
felony convictions. 
He was arrested and charged with 
three misdemeanors and two felonies 
including tampering with evidence 
and possession of a firearm by a con-victed felon.Police: Man ate weed

Students with smart phones can check

Gowalla, a location-based social net-
working service, allows users to “check 
in” at various spots on campus using their phones.
In partnership with the Associated 
Press Top 25, Gowalla has launched the AP Top 25 Gowalla Check-In Chal-lenge, which lets students at 25 univer -
sities check into five highlighted spots 
for their university, earning their school 
points, which increases its ranking in the challenge. 
The top school will receive a $10,000 
general scholarship.
 UF is currently No. 10 in the poll, 
dropping from third place a week ago.
“We want to encourage students to participate with student-run activities, 
go to games and get involved on their 
campuses,” said Ashley Cass, a Gowalla campus ambassador. 
The five spots for UF are at Century 
Tower, the Reitz Union, Ben Hill Griffin Stadium, the Stephen C. O’Connell Cen-ter and UF in general.
Users may check in to five spots per 
day. Each time, the user will be entered to win a variety of prizes, including a Macbook Air and an iPad.

Today Californians will vote on Proposition 19,  which, if 
passed, would legalize the possession  of marijuana up to 28.5 
grams for people 21 years old or older. In addition, it will al-low growing of marijuana at a personal residence in a space 
up to 25 square feet. 
Yet no matter what the results at the polls say , marijuana 
will remain illegal, according to local experts.
Martin McMahon Jr., a professor at UF’s Levin College of 
Law, said that federal law will prevent Proposition 19 from 
branching out to other states, such as Florida. Since the fed-eral government has already announced that it will continue to enforce federal laws banning marijuana, he said he doesn’t see the bill going far, or California making much revenue off the ballot.
Paul Doering, a professor in the College of Pharmacy at UF, 
has a different take on the proposition.  He sees the measure as being more about making money than getting high as the tax revenue from the law 
could generate $1.4 billion a year.
The most opposition is ironically seen from those who are 
selling because, for the most part, they would be out of busi-
ness, Doering said.
According to Doering, the legalities of the proposition pres-ent a multi-faceted nightmare. 
The passage of this bill, he said, will do nothing but open a 
can of worms. It presents medical, economic, religious and nu-merous other concerns. So many issues crash into each other with this initiative.
“It’s like the California artichoke,” Doering said. “You peel 
back one issue, and there are still more.” 
The most common misconception about marijuana, Doer -
ing said, is its safety . According to Doering, the jury is still out on whether the drug is safe. He called marijuana the “fixin’ to” drug because often, users get so sucked into smoking that they lose motivation in other aspects of their life.  
“Have you ever heard the song ‘Because I Got High’ by 
Afroman?” Doering asked. “Where do you think he got the motivation?”Calif. to vote on controversial marijuana proposition“We want to encourage students

lot, an educated vote means knowing what each mean. 
The Alligator compiled a list of pros and cons and analysis 
from UF professors to help explain this year’s amendments. 
Amendment 1: Repeal of public campaign finance
This proposal would eliminate a 1998 amendment that 
made public campaign financing a requirement. The amend-
ment would provide legislators the chance to pass laws remov-ing the public financing program if it passes, according to a report from the Collins Center for Public Policy Inc. 
The Republican-dominated state legislature supported put-
ting this amendment on the ballot.
 Supporters believe the proposal makes sense given the 
tough economic situation because it would remove the man-date that taxpayer dollars be used to support candidates who can, and often do, raise money on their own, according to a Collins Center report.
Those opposed argue that voters already voiced their opin-
ions in 1998 with the amendment that added public financing 
to the constitution and that public financing gives candidates 
without wealthy backers a better chance in races. 
Richard Scher, a UF political science professor, said the pos-
sibility for non-wealthy candidates to emerge in election races would be almost impossible if the amendment passes. 
“It really doesn’t matter for the Rick Scotts of the world,” he 
said, referring to the Republican candidate for governor who has invested more than $70 million in his campaign.
Kristin Klein, president of UF College Democrats, worries 
that candidates would become more tied to special interests if the amendment passes because they would be more dependent on them for financing without a public option.
Amendment 2: Tax break for deployed soldiers
This amendment would require the state legislature to give 
an added homestead property tax break for members of the U.S. military and its reserves, the U.S Coast Guard and its re-serves, and the Florida National Guard on active duty outside of the U.S. in the past year. 
This amendment is probably the least controversial of the 
six on the ballot, with no organized opposition to it. 
It would help compensate military members for their ser -
vices overseas, although it would also lead to a decline in local government tax collections and would exclude members of the military who don’t own property. Tax breaks would be deter -
mined by how long someone served overseas. For example, if someone was deployed outside the U.S. for six months, he would get a 50-percent exemption. 
Scher expects the measure to pass, but said that even non-
controversial amendments can face challenges. 
With the constitutional amendment passed in the last elec-
tion requiring a consensus of at least 60 percent to pass these measures, he said it is hard to decide whether Amendment 2 or any of the others have the horsepower to pass. Amendment 4: Hometown democracy
One of the most controversial amendments, it would re-
quire voters to approve any proposals to adopt or amend local comprehensive land use plans (growth-management plans).
Florida Hometown Democracy Inc., an organization that 
began getting petition signatures in 2003 for the amendment, and other supporters believe the proposal would give voters a chance to prevent local governments from placing developers’ interests above those of their constituents. 
Many developers, politicians and other opponents argue 
that the amendment would create unwieldy ballots that are too long and too technical, overwhelming voters. 
Katrina Schwartz, a UF political science professor special-
izing in environmental politics, said the amendment could be a wake-up call to legislators about voter demands that they crack down on development and not defer to developers’ desires. 
It won’t prevent developers from using money to influence 
the process, however, but will just shift their focus, she said. In-stead of directing persuasive efforts toward local governments devising plans, they would bombard voters with information supporting their particular plans.  Voters may not have the time 
or desire to learn enough about the intricacies of land planning 
to make educated decisions about these plans, she said. 
Ryan Garcia of the UF College Republicans said he is con-
cerned that Amendment 4 would lead to an increase in prop-erty taxes and that it would become a “blank check” because budgets don’t have to be disclosed to taxpayers. 
He also doesn’t think it would give voters a real voice be-
cause of the probable low turnout rates for such decisions. 
Gainesville City Commissioner Jeanna Mastrodicasa is op-
posed to the amendment because, while she believes it is well-intended, she said it would only give developers more power and make reading through ballots less appealing to voters. 
If people are unhappy with land planning decisions, they 
should elect new officials who will make better ones, she said. 
The City Commission decided to oppose the amendment 
officially with a 6-1 vote in July.  Commissioner Thomas Hawk-ins said he is concerned that the amendment would prevent meaningful conversations about land planning between local 
officials when they know it will ultimately come down to an 
“up or down” vote by the public.
Amendments 5 and 6: Changes to redistricting
These amendments would prevent politicians from draw-
ing legislative districts to favor one party over another.
Districts are redrawn every 10 years and are marked by po-
litical clashes, as the majority party often tries to design districts to protect its majority and incumbents (gerrymandering.)  
“There’s always blood on the floor when they do reappor -
tionment,” Scher said of the process. 
If passed, the measure would give a voice to the people 
who demand that redistricting be a fair process rather than an “incumbency protection plan,” he said. However, even if the amendments pass, redistricting would remain in the legisla-
tors’ hands, and Scher said he doubts the amendments would 
eliminate  gerrymandering problems. The amendments would provide standards for judges to re-
fer to and would allow them to make decisions about redistrict-
ing plans. There are no standards for redistricting in Florida 
now, so judges have little revision power. 
Opponents argue that the requirements may be difficult to 
follow in practice and that it may hurt minority representation 
because legislators wouldn’t be able to draw districts balancing 
the political “playing field” for minorities.
Hawkins supports these amendments, which would help 
prevent legislators from drawing districts along lines that di-vide neighborhoods among different representatives. Com-munities can be divided into districts under the legislature’s usual methods, which can make it difficult for representatives to adequately represent all their constituents, he said. 
Mastrodicasa also supports the measures and said she 
knows people from both parties who support them, as well. 
They would prevent legislators from giving too much pow-
er to the incumbent party, regardless of which one is in power at any given time, she said. 
Another measure about redistricting, Amendment 7, would 
have essentially nullified Amendments 5 and 6 if passed. But the proposal, which was added to the ballot by the Republican-controlled legislature, was removed from the ballot by a circuit court judge’s order.  
Amendment 8: Relaxing class size requirements
This would increase the maximum number of students al-
lowed in a class, changing from a maximum number per class to a school-wide average. For example, a high school could increase one class’s capacity to 30 students as long as another class had fewer than the average class size of 25 students.
Supporters argue that the cost of limiting class sizes is too 
high and that this would save money and provide flexibility . 
A July report by Florida TaxWatch’s Center for Educational 
Performance and Accountability estimated that the state could save about $10 billion during the next decade if it passes.
Opponents argue that these savings could mean further cuts 
in education funding because schools would not receive any of the money allocated for the original plan. They say voters were clear in 2002 when they passed the first class size amendment. 
The Florida Education Association is one of the organiza-
tions opposing the measure. It filed a lawsuit challenging the bill, but the Florida Supreme Court upheld a circuit court judge’s decision to keep it on the ballot. 
Scher said he thinks the amendment is another attack on 
public schools. Teachers will bear the burden if this amend-
ment is passed, but the losers will be the students, he said. 
Klein expects Democrats to vote against the measure and 
Republicans to support it. 
“Even though a lot of people say it only increases the class 
by three or four [students], when are they going to stop? There’s 
a cap for a reason and it needs to stay ,” Klein said. 
For pre-kindergarten through third grade, the amendment 
would set an average class size of 18 students and a maximum of 21. For fourth through eighth grade, the average would be 22 students with a maximum of 27. For high school, the average would be 25 students with a maximum of 30. Amendments include class sizes, tax breaks, land use and other issues

Today’s question: Are you going to vote?
70 TOTAL VOTES71% YES29% NOMonday’s question: Should the state enforce spending limits on campaigns?Advice to the new Tea Party Congress
Now that the bloodletting has stopped and we collectively nurse our wounds after a messy and angry election cycle, the mantle of governance 
weighs heavy on newly minted insurgent members of Congress.
Though it shall be a great challenge, the men and 
women elected to represent us must somehow over -
come the shame they will undoubtedly feel upon be-coming members of a sitting government.
Having campaigned for months, aggressively attack-
ing “politics as usual” and “Washington insiders,” many 
Tea Party politicians might be shocked to learn they will 
likely have to now take up residence in or around our 
nation’s capital and begin to vote on legislation.
Flown in on the wings of a screaming eagle while 
bearing gnashed teeth and sharp swords, it may be dif-
ficult for the Tea Party candidates to accept something 
as mundane as their role in the formation of public pol-
icy.
Resisting that natural self-hate welling up in their 
pure hearts could be a challenge for many of the shiny new idealists who find themselves in charge of our coun-try, but this vital infusion of lifeblood is what keeps our country pumping along in the three months we now al-lot our politicians to govern in between election cycles.
However, one heartening note about the state of our 
country is a newfound respect for the rights of snakes and a general consensus forming across the notion that one must not tread on them. 
On top of their previously demonstrated healthy def-
erence toward serpents, a clear plan for steering Ameri-ca through rough economic times should be the focus of our next Congress.  
With spending so high, we often need to invent new imaginary numbers to wrap our heads around the levels of theo-retical debt we are conjuring up on an annual basis. 
Congress has been tasked with 
spending less money and/or rais-ing revenue to cover the balance we owe.
Congress must first come up 
with a complete rebranding of certain bureaucratic tools. Traditionally known as taxation, siphoning enough money to sustain regulatory promises could be again referred to as a tribute.
This recycled term has roots in things like “the good 
old days,” and it implies some semblance of class and order, which will play well in the heartland and bread-basket areas of our country’s expanding midsection.
As far as actual legislation goes, one of the first 
tributes established by our Tea Party order could be a bill designed to close a loophole in the proposed extra taxation of sugared beverages that currently allows the godless heathens who drink unsweetened tea to escape what most call the soda tax.
Aside from the obvious political benefits of defend-
ing the glorious Southern roots of sweet tea, closing the unsweetened tea loophole would allow the Tea Party to introduce a bill they can be proud to call their own. By the grace of a vengeful deity and the guts of the 112th Congress, we should see the establishment of a tribute on tea.
From what I can tell, nobody remembers anything 
that happened in the 1770s anyway.

The Alligator encourages 
students to vote today
Ladies and gents, it all comes down to today. 
Months of campaign banners littering our roadways, 
TV advertisements spewing half- truths while simulta-
neously interrupting our “Modern Family” obsession and 
news about who’s the angriest at whom all come down to 
today. 
Months of Floridians “getting to work” and talks of Tea 
Party turbulence peppered with rallies to restore sanity find 
their match today. 
It’s not yet winter, Gators, but our favorite time of the year 
makes its let’s-hope-for-no-hanging-chads-this-year debut today. 
It’s Election Day. And we hope you’ve survived the type 
of take-no-prisoners political carnage candidates have sub-
jected us to since … well, has it ever stopped?
This is the day your little black pen becomes the star. This 
is the day when no number of campaign sound bites and no 
amount of bipartisan bickering can steal your spotlight.
No, Gators, this is your day. Steal the show.This is the day in which millions upon millions of cam-
paigning dollars boil down to one simple fact: each and every one of you carries an equal weight at the ballot. 
This is where T. Jefferson & Co. start smiling and flashing 
their Founding Father grins. This is where the beauty of our country lies.
And this is also where they would probably shake their 
big-wig heads in shame.
With the freedom given to us so many years ago to elect 
the people who vote on our behalf, many of us choose to, well, keep watching “Modern Family” instead of voting. 
And voter apathy is one of the biggest destroyers of our 
democracy. 
Nothing makes less sense than those who chastise us for 
voting for this person or that person while not having voted at all. 
We heard Republicans moan and admonish those who 
voted to enact the historic 2008 election of President Barack Obama as Democrats also took control of the U.S. Senate. And later tonight, all of us will probably endure the cries of dis-consolate Democrats, who may  lose control of their picture-perfect majority created just two years ago. 
Aside from the fact that we think an apparent majority of 
Americans might not be lending the Democrats in power a fair shot of pulling the country from the eight-year wreckage of Afghanistan, Iraq and a financial collapse, we won’t be too mad at anyone when we wake up Wednesday.
But if you have no intention of voting and are indifferent 
toward the whole process, consider yourself deleted from our Facebook friends, or at least hidden from our news feed. We’re just not interested in anything you have to say anymore. 
We won’t hold any grudges if you vote a fraudulent man 
into our governor’s office, or a woman who mistakes His-panic people for Asians into a Senate seat in Nevada, or even a woman who doesn’t know where the separation between church and state clause can be found in our Constitution (sor -
ry, Mr. Madison) into a Senate seat in Delaware.
A lot of people are going to be depressed Wednesday, re-
gardless of whatever the outcome might be, but that’s what the next election is for. 
We’d much rather you exercise your right to vote for some-
one we didn’t vote for than not have voted at all. We really enjoy heated political pow-wows about how the person you 
voted for is messing up our lives. And if you don’t vote, you 
force us to have conversations about nothing more than our new shampoo. 
Today’s the day, Gators. Take your spotlight at the ballot.

Letters to the Editor
Reader opposes airboat curfews
If the proposed ordinance to enforce a 
7 p.m. to 7 a.m. airboat curfew in Alachua 
County passes, it will cost county taxpay-
ers hundreds of thousands of dollars. Dur -
ing two years of public hearings on this 
issue, county reports have come to the conclusion that Alachua County has no 
compelling reason to adopt an airboat cur -
few. The county attorneys have indicated 
the same. 
In addition, the Alachua County Com-
mission last year voted not to approve the 
airboat curfew.
We ask for all concerned taxpayers, 
sportsmen, boaters and citizens to contin-
ue to voice their opposition to this unfair 
curfew as it will negatively affect many 
waterway users, property owners and sportsmen. 
Tell the commission you want them to 
enforce the current state and county vessel 
sound ordinances. 
Furthermore, ask where the money will 
be coming from to provide for enforce-
ment of this ordinance. 
Ask how much taxpayer money com-
missioners are willing to spend defending 
this unfair and discriminatory ordinance 
from a legal challenge as opponents have promised to file suit. 
Vote “No” on Ordinance 1 today.

Reader opposes Amendment 4
Thursday’s Amendment Showdown 
was a foolish article with little journalistic 
integrity. 
Rather than give the readers the oppor -
tunity to make their own decisions, you gave an opinionated list of misinformed decisions.
We need all the money we can get? 
No tax break for deployed military? Or Amendment 4, which puts any change to land use plans for local cities on the bal-
lot. 
What major company in its right mind 
would choose a new location where they 
have to wait for an election to begin work? 
I’m sorry, but before you pin Amend-
ment 4 nay-sayers as realtors and builders, 
why don’t you consider the amount of job 
potential lost. 
Vote “No” on Amendment 4, do more 
research other than reading signs on the 
road and give people a chance to make 
their own decisions.

Column riddled with falsehoods
In Nate Rushing’s Thursday column, 
Rushing said  “there’s strong evidence for an abortion and breast cancer link” and 
cited the discredited, conspiratorial abor -
tionbreastcancer.com group as his source. 
This is dangerous misinformation that 
must be corrected.
There is no reputable organization that 
says there is any link between abortions and breast cancer. 
The National Cancer Institute found 
that “Induced abortion is not associated with an increase in breast cancer risk,” 
in February 2003, and a review of studies since then “still does not support early ter -
mination of pregnancy as a cause of breast cancer.”
The American Cancer Society says, “At 
this time, the scientific evidence does not support the notion that abortion of any kind raises the risk of breast cancer” and 
“the public is not well-served by false 
alarms.”
Groups like abortionbreastcancer.com 
cherry-pick statistics, misrepresent the re-sults of studies and cite out-of-date studies 
with faulty methodologies to support their 
claims. 
They frequently claim the support of 
questionable organizations that have offi-
cial-sounding names (i.e.,”Association of 
American Physicians and Surgeons”) with bogus medical journals. 
For example, one such journal, the Jour -
nal of American Physicians and Surgeons, 
oft-cited by people linking breast cancer to 
abortion, has also published articles ques-tioning whether HIV causes AIDS. 
Don’t be fooled. These organizations 
do not represent mainstream scientific thought — or any scientific thought for that matter.
Rushing has completely embarrassed 
himself either by letting himself be tricked 
by dishonest charlatans without critically 
examining their claims or by knowingly peddling their nonsense to advance his point of view. 
Either way, it doesn’t speak well of his 
intellect or his intellectual honesty. And it doesn’t do people who are pro-life (plenty 
of whom are smart, honest, good people) 
any favors to be associated with that.
But the Alligator should be most em-
barrassed for printing Rushing’s column without apparently even the slightest fact-checking. 
Rushing gave incorrect and dangerous 
medical advice to UF’s women without knowing what he’s talking about. 
The Alligator should publish a formal 
correction for Rushing’s mistake and deny 
Rushing a chance to do it again.

Columnist presents a problematic 
viewpoint
There are many problematic statements 
in Nate Rushing’s article. First of all, he 
suggests criminally charging abortion 
clinics and doctors, who provide a much-
needed service. 
Such statements can only contribute to 
violence against clinic workers and doc-
tors. If that isn’t the case, then he’s sug-
gesting criminally charging about half of all women, which is the proportion of women who have abortions by age 45. 
Next, there is no link between abortion 
and breast cancer. Those studies that sug-gest such a link are flawed. The National Cancer Institute elaborates on how that myth has since been discredited. 
I would also like to address his time is-
sue. Fewer than 2 percent of abortions take place past 21 weeks, and when they do, it’s because there is a proven risk to the wom-an or the fetus. 
Also, if a fetus is legally made a per -
son, you are only opening the door for more control over women and their bod-ies, carried out in a completely irrational 
way. Women are not incubators; we need 
fair reproductive rights and reproductive health care.  
Abortion is a very safe medical proce-
dure that should be a choice between a woman, her family and her doctor. 
If Rushing was trying to reduce harm to 
children or decrease the number of abor -
tions, his efforts should be applied in a different manner. Changing laws to take away womens’ rights and inserting per -
sonal morality is not the answer.

Meat pies, Ghanaian pancakes, 
Tamarind balls and baklava were just a 
few of the main courses being offered 
at TreatZ from Around the World: A Dessert Exposition.
The event was hosted by the Mu 
Epsilon Chapter of Zeta Phi Beta So-
rority Inc. on Monday night. 
Students floated back and forth be-
tween the Institute of Black Culture 
and the Institute of Hispanic-Latino 
Cultures, sampling the different des-
serts. Printed recipes accompanied all of the treats.
About 75 people attended, accord-
ing to Kyra Montaque, secretary of 
Zeta Phi Beta and co-coordinator of 
TreatZ from Around the World.
The exposition was intended to 
showcase the various cultural organi-
zations on campus. 
Beyond desserts, the event featured 
games, including dominoes and cards, 
and music from countries around the world.  
This is the first year that the sorori-ty has put on this event as part of their 
So Sweet Candy DreamZ fall week, 
which kicked off with a church service Sunday. 
“We like to do different events 
around the community to mingle with other students and get our name out there,” said Shelby Dixon, president of Zeta Phi Beta. 
“Events like this help to expose stu-
dents to diversity on the campus and learn something different about some-one else.”
The Dominican Student Associa-
tion, UF Caribbean Students Associa-tion, Central American Latin Organi-zation, Theta Nu Xi Sorority Inc., Club Creole, the African Student Union, the Jamaican-American Student Associa-
tion and the Arabic Student Union co-
sponsored the event.
Adelaide Sefah, a Ghana-native, 
and Sherry Akanni, who lived in Ni-
geria, went to represent the African 
Student Union. 
“It sounded really interesting, and 
it’s not something you can do every day,” Akanni said. “I came out to try 
all of the other treats, too.”8, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 2, 2010

� UF HAS A ‘RAINBOW ROOM’ TO HELP 
STUDENTS FEEL SAFE.
By ERIN JESTER
Alligator Contributing Writer
UF freshman Shawn Abrahams is like most 
college students his age. He likes to watch foot-
ball games and hang out with his friends, and 
he is looking forward to getting more involved with his new major, botany.
Yet Abrahams considers himself better off 
than most freshmen.
Abrahams, who is openly gay, has made 
use of the many resources available to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender students at UF, attending every meeting of the Pride Student 
Union since school began.
“In high school, it was hard to meet people 
who were gay,” Abrahams said. “Now there are 
all these people I can talk to. It’s kind of like a culture shock, going from being a lone wolf on campus to being part of a community of people.”
The highly publicized suicides of several gay 
youth over the last two months have served as a reminder that there is an ever-present need for support and resources for the lesbian, gay, 
bisexual and transgender community, particu-
larly among teenagers. UF is home to a few programs that have goals to help people accept their own identities and feel safe and welcome.
The Rainbow Room, located on the fourth 
floor of Peabody Hall at UF, is a dedicated space for LGBT students to feel safe and wel-
come. The room was set up by the Office of 
LGBT Affairs. 
The space is just one of the Office of LGBT 
Affairs’ efforts to support and advocate for the student LGBT community and to provide education and a sense of community, said AC Stokes, director of the Office of LGBT Affairs, which is located one floor below the multicol-ored sanctuary.
Stokes said that people who are struggling 
with their identity don’t always seek the kind of help the Office of LGBT Affairs or the coun-seling center can give. Instead, they might try to suppress their feelings by seeking the help of 
people who enforce the idea that homosexual-
ity is abnormal or wrong. 
“They go to people who want to make them 
‘normal,’” Stokes said. “If someone feels that level of self-loathing, that’s probably what they want. That’s why we need allies and not force people down the same road of agony.”
Students can find allies at the Counseling 
and Wellness Center on Radio Road, which has 
31 full-time senior staff members, plus several 
part-time counselors, interns and trainees. 
“Certainly there is a set of issues and a set 
of tasks around coming to terms with not being heterosexual in our culture,” said Jim Probert, a licensed psychologist who works at the center.  “And there’s a lot of work for that individual to do.”
The best way to start, he said, is by finding 
people who are accepting and encouraging and to start a support system.
Joining the counseling center’s LGBT em-
powerment group is one way to do that. An-
other way is attending a Pride Stu-dent Union meeting. Pride meets on Monday nights in the Ustler Hall atrium to discuss everything 
from hate crimes to body image to career coun-
seling. 
According to Donnie Fields, a political sci-
ence senior and the president of Pride Student 
Union, the forum is designed for all students, not just for those who identify as LGBT. 
“We really have to take care of each other,” 
Fields said.“This is a tolerant campus, but things aren’t perfect here.” 
Fields encourages students who are strug-
gling with their own identity to come out or talk to just one person who is willing to listen. He stressed that after talking about it, things start to get easier. 
“The hardest thing is to take the first step to 
ask for help,” Fields said. “There’s no magical fairy that comes around and makes things bet-ter for you.”Campus groups, services

It’s exam week, your stress levels 
are through the roof and you haven’t 
even started studying for your first midterm tomorrow. 
For some, a little extra help to 
boost concentration is a popular first resort. That little boost comes in the form of a small pill called Adderall.
The pill, prescribed to treat atten-
tion deficit hyperactivity disorder and narcolepsy, is an amphetamine and contains similar chemicals to those found in crystal meth. 
Although the recreational use of 
Adderall is common on college cam-puses, it can pose a threat to the body due to its harmful effects.
Adderall should be used only by 
those in serious need of it, said Adri-anus De Ruyter, a private practice psychiatrist from Brandon, Fla., who specializes in patients with ADHD.
De Ruyter said that for an Ad-
derall prescription to be appropriate, a patient should be inattentive and have a lot of concentration problems. In most cases, they are ones diag-nosed with ADHD.
Those who use Adderall occa-
sionally to improve their perfor -
mance while studying may not be 
aware that it has long-term effects 
on the body. Hypertension and heart problems are the main consequences of taking Adderall recreationally, De Ruyter said.   
“If you become dependent on 
it, it becomes a nasty problem,” De Ruyter said.  He said if someone becomes de-
pendent on it, he could get addicted and have a higher risk of turning to crystal meth, a stronger stimulant.
The difference between a person 
who is in serious need of Adderall and one who isn’t is that those who don’t need to take Adderall are able to focus without it, De Ruyter said. Besides the warnings of drug use, 
there still is a ubiquity of Adderall 
use by college students. 
Josh Chandler, a UF student, 
knows quite a few people who use Adderall to study and said they use it about once every other week, de-pending on the test.  
However, Chandler said he 
doesn’t see a drastic improvement in his friends’ test grades when study-ing on Adderall.  
“They get more done, but I’m not 
sure if it translates to better grades,” Chandler said. 
Sam Schewe, a UF student who 
is diagnosed with ADHD, has been prescribed Adderall for almost a year now and believes that it is much more beneficial to him than to those who use it recreationally . 
“People who use it just to study 
for an exam are cheating out of their responsibilities,” he said.Psychiatrist: Adderall 
poses serious risks

� SHE WILL APPEAL TO STATE OFFICIALS IF THE 
BUDGET ISN’T CHANGED BY NOV. 3.
By KATHLEEN BIRKHIMER
Alligator Contributing Writer
Alachua County Sheriff Sadie Darnell is taking her fight 
with the County Commission all the way to the governor. 
Darnell will not certify the County Commission’s 2010-
2011 budget and plans to appeal to Florida state officials if it is not modified by the state’s Nov. 3 dead-
line. 
Her office is asking for an additional 
$507,000 for the next budget cycle, she said.
Darnell said she has been before the 
board numerous times and suggested sev-
eral different options, including reallocat-ing part of the $711,000 she saved from last 
year’s budget toward the additional funds she has requested, she said.
“My belief is that half a million does have an impact on my 
budget,” she said. “Some nonessential programs [have been favored] rather than the essential service of public safety.”
None of the county commissioners returned repeated re-
quest for comment. 
Darnell said the relationship between the sheriff and the 
board “hasn’t been productive for the past several years.” 
She said that in the past few years, more than $6 million in 
total has been taken out of her budget without her input.County sheriff threatens to take budget woes to governorSTUDENT LIFE

“Serving no useful purpose” since the summer 
of 2010.  
The slogan for Superfluous Clothing Inc. says 
a lot about the attitude behind the Web-based graphic T-shirt company founded by UF students Mike Dion and Jeff Spalding. 
The official website, superfluousclothing.com, 
premiered in August, and they are working on making it more user-friendly, said Dion, a junior finance major and CFO of the company.
Spalding, a senior computer science major and 
CEO of the company, was eating with a friend in Tijuana Flats and noticed the bumper stickers that adorn the hot sauce bar. He said he pointed out how he finds bumper stickers obnoxious, and if he were to have one, it would say something pithy 
like, “This is a car” or “This is superfluous.”
The idea to own a graphic T-shirt store came 
later when the duo was in the mall discussing 
how few stores there were that they would actu-
ally want to shop in, Dion said. 
“Everyone thought we were kidding,” he 
said. 
Recently, the pair has been entering their de-
signs in contests hosted by popular T-shirt web-sites such as WOOT and Threadless. Although 
they have yet to have one printed through one of these hosts, their submissions have been highly rated, Spalding said. 
The shirts generally feature humorous say-
ings, though some are more design influenced. The shirts range from $15 to $20 each.
Most of the original shirt designs were done 
with flex printing, meaning the designs are print-ed on a foil and burned into the shirt. This ensures the design lasts longer than the less expensive digital printing standard, Spalding said. 
“When you get a Superfluous shirt, you get a 
good quality shirt,” Dion said.
So far, the shirts have been sold to friends and 
by word-of-mouth from social networking web-sites like Facebook and Twitter. Recent UF gradu-ate Seiya Miyazaki said he heard about Superflu-ous Clothing after the company followed him on 
Twitter. 
“I thought the shirts were hilarious,” he said. 
“I bought one that says, ‘If you’re also wearing 
this shirt we must high five,’ and I’ve gotten some compliments on it just wearing it around.” 
Dion said they don’t have plans to expand 
beyond the website, although they would like to eventually act as a distributor for their shirts to be sold in stores.
“Even if this never gets any farther off the 
ground, I will still contend that the idea of Super -
fluous Clothing is a good idea,” Spalding said.Gators sell ‘superfluous’ shirts

The student organization Vic-
tory Over Violence will be host-
ing auditions for “The Vagina 
Monologues” this Tuesday and Wednesday from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. in the  Reitz Union Room 275.
Based on a book by Eve Ensler, 
“The Vagina Monologues” is a play consisting of a collection of interviews by women of all ages 
discussing their personal experi-
ences of their womanhood. 
Emmanuela Lebrun, president 
of VOV , said they are looking to fill a little more than 25 parts and 
are seeking charismatic people 
who can express happiness, sad-ness and even do accents.
Auditions will be cold read-ings and no prior acting experi-
ence is needed. Those who try 
out will be able to choose parts and act it out with the script in their hands.
According to Jenna Calton, 
who served as the director of last year’s production, the play is a cornerstone of the V-Day campaigns, a global movement 
designed to end violence against 
women.
“It is an extremely rewarding 
experience when 
you hear these 
women stand up at the end of the 
play and share their personal tes-timonials,” Calton said.
Proceeds from the play will 
be donated to VOV’s beneficiary, Peaceful Paths Domestic Abuse Network. Women from the shel-
ter are invited to attend the show 
free of cost.
The play is tentatively sched-
uled to take place in the spring.Group seeks dozens

While some may view Google’s recent 
announcement of designing a self-driving 
car as having the potential to revolutionize 
the automobile industry, some are hesitant to embrace the new technology, citing a lack of confidence in the machine’s ability 
to navigate the roadways safely and accu-
rately. 
“The problem that I see is that traffic 
comes from all angles,” said Fazil Najafi, professor in the Department of Civil and Coastal Engineering at UF. “People are 
careless.”
According to Google, the automated 
cars use video cameras, radar sensors and 
a laser range finder to “see” traffic. They also use detailed maps, collected using 
manually driven vehicles, to navigate the 
road.
Najafi said it would be marvelous if the 
sensors are able to detect traffic safely and accurately from all angles; however, he is 
not sure if that is possible yet.
Erin Mullins, a sophomore engineering major at UF, believes there could be prob-
lems with this software on a mass produc-
tion scale. 
“It would take a while for it to be safe,” 
Mullins said. “If one malfunctions, some-
thing could happen to the mechanics of 
the other surrounding cars 
because they would prob-
ably be connected on the same frequency.” 
According to the World Health Orga-
nization, there are more than 1.2 million 
deaths caused by road traffic accidents 
every year. Google said it hopes to reduce that by at least half through the use of technology.  
Although Google is still in the experi-
mental stage of this project, they foresee this software having enormous potential to advance transportation. 
Jay Nancarrow, a Google press corre-
spondent, said that while Google was not 
going to speculate on the next steps of the 
project as it is in the initial stages, they are committed to designing the best technol-ogy possible.
”We are 100 percent focused on the 
immediate computer science and robot-ics challenges we are trying to solve,” he said.Google’s self-driving car announcement raises brows� BLOCK TUITION COULD 
GENERATE AN EXTRA $4 MILLION A YEAR FOR UF.
By JOEY FLECHAS
Alligator Staff Writer
About 30 students and fac-
ulty gathered in Pugh Hall Mon-
day night for a forum about the looming issue of block tuition.
The forum was held in ad-
vance of this week’s Board of Governors meeting, which will be held Wednesday and Thurs-day at Emerson Alumni Hall.
Under one proposal for block 
tuition, full-time undergraduates would pay flat tuition, likely set at the cost of 15 credit hours, if 12 to 18 credit hours are taken.
UF students currently pay per 
credit hour.
Provost Joe Glover said such a 
change could help increase UF’s graduation rate. 
He said the university esti-
mates the switch would generate about $4 million of extra recur -
ring revenue, which would be reinvested in the form of add-
ing sections to classes and hiring 
faculty to accommodate more students.
But he emphasized that it isn’t 
about the bottom line.
“This is not a program to gen-
erate revenue,” he said.
Some students raised con-
cerns over the pressure they would face to take 15 credits or more, since it would be more economical.
Glover took a different per -
spective, saying students who worry about whether they should register for classes be-cause of costs could shift their 
focus on meeting their require-
ments instead.
By the end, he said he was 
pleased with the tone of the fo-rum and the students who par -

� SOLDIERS RODE ELEPHANTS 
ACROSS A FLOODED RIVER.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
LONDON — British tea planter Gyles Mack-
rell organized one of the most remarkable res-cue missions during World War II — by using elephants when nothing else would do.
Now researchers have released new informa-
tion that tells, for the first time, the full story of Mackrell’s successful effort to use the animals to evacuate hundreds of desperate Burmese refugees stranded by a rain-swollen river. On Monday, Britain’s Cambridge University put online a video shot by Mackrell, which together with his diaries and other documents brings to life a feat that with time had faded from public memory.
The material explains how Mackrell, who 
spent most of his life working as a planter for a tea company in British India, came to the aid of masses of people desperate to escape Burma as the Japanese army advanced. Through his work, he had access to elephants — the only safe way to cross the roiling Dapha river at the Indian border.
Tens of thousands of the refugees — many 
sick and starving — had trekked for hundreds of miles through dense jungle in the hope of reaching the Indian border. But by May 1942, 
those who made it to the border were trapped 
by monsoons that had turned the Dapha into a torrent.
Mackrell’s diaries show that he collected 
some elephants to travel to the river soon after receiving a call for help from a group of refugees on June 4, 1942. His party rode the elephants for about 100 miles before finally reaching the river bank, where they saw that fierce flood waters had trapped Burmese soldiers on river islands.
In the weeks that followed, Mackrell and his 
colleagues set up camp by the Dapha and helped 200 people cross the river.Films tell story of WWII

TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 2, 2010 � STUDENT LIVING GUIDE,  ALLIGATOR, 3
Gainesville has plenty 
of off-campus housing including apartments, 
condos, houses, and rooms for rent.  
Take your time when looking 
for a place to live and follow the tips below for finding the right place for you:
1. Use the Off Campus Hous-
ing Locator Service at http://housing.offcampus.ufl.edu.
2.  Know your budget and 
choose a property that allows you to live within your means.
3.  Create a priority list.  What 
do you care about most in a living space?  Room size, rent, type of lease, type of commu -
nity (large undergrad popula-tion, graduate students, local residents, etc.), location, prox-imity to campus or bus route…all these things are factors to consider in choosing a place to live.  
Write out a list of ideal char -
acteristics you want in your future living space and keep these criteria in mind when se -
lecting a location.
4. Choose a well-suited room-
mate or choose to live alone.  Know what kind of person would best compliment your personal-ity and choose accordingly.
5.  Drive around  and visit the 
place and neighborhood you are looking to live in.  
6.  Take a tour of the com-
plexes or houses that interest you, ask questions, and get to 
know the complex management or rental house landlord.
7.  Ask your friends for advice  
on where to live.  Which prop-erties worked well for them?  Which didn’t?
8.  To check crime statis-
tics in the area where you are thinking about living visit the Gainesville Police Department website www.gainesvillepd.org and click on the Crime Reports link.
This website will allow you to 
enter the address of the places where you are thinking about living and on a map the crime in the area will be displayed.
9.  Go back to the property at 
night and make some observa-tions.  Is it well lit, do you see the security guard that manage -
ment promised, is the security gate working, is it quiet enough to study, how close is the bus stop or parking to the complex or house, etc.?
10.  Once you’ve narrowed 
down your search make an ap -
pointment with UF’s Student Legal Services by visiting their website www.studentlegalser -
vices.ufl.edu for more informa-tion.  SLS can help you in re -
viewing the lease BEFORE you sign it. 
This is a great way to know 
what your legal responsibilities will be under that lease. 
11.  Gainesville is a GREAT 
place to rent and live so have 
fun with your search.Make sure you read and fully 
understand all aspects of the lease before signing. 
A lease is a contract between you and 
your landlord that spells out specific details of your living arrangement.  Leases often involve policies about pets, security and pet deposits, legal entry and other impor -
tant information. 
Typically, leases in Gainesville are for 
12 months. If you will need your place for 10 months or less, talk with the manage -
ment about whether they can provide you a shorter term lease.  
There are two types of leases that are 
usually available, Joint Leases and Individ-ual Leases.
Joint Lease
All roommates are held responsible for 
the lease.  If one person breaks the lease, the other roommates are held responsible for paying the total rent.  This tends to be the lease more prominent when renting a house or single family dwelling.
 
Individual Lease
Each person is held responsible for his 
or her own actions.  For instance, if one roommate breaks the lease, that person is still responsible for paying their own rent.  For most college students, individual leas-es are the best choice.  Each person in the lease is responsible for his or her own ac-tions and not the actions of a roommate. 
Clauses to LOOK 
FOR in a lease
 Dates of occupancy
 Amount of monthly rent and the date it 
is due each month
  Amount of Security Deposit
  Responsibility for payment of utilities  Responsibility for general mainte-
nance and repairs
 Sublease: If you sign a 12 month lease 
but think you may need your apartment/house for a shorter period of time, make sure the lease allows you to sublease (rent your apartment/house to another person who will assume the remainder of your lease) 

 Pet policy
  Automatic renewal clause
 Type of lease: joint vs. individual
Clauses to AVOID
 in a lease
  At management’s discretion, the ten-
ant may be asked to leave within three days

  Tenant waives all defects in the build-
ing
  Landlord shall not be responsible 
for injury to person, including tenant and guests, as a result of any cause

  Tenant is responsible for all repairs 
to premises 
  Landlord may enter dwelling without 
notice
  Landlord has a lien (a legal claim on 
the property of another as security for the payment of a debt) on all personal property of tenant
A great University of Florida resource 
available to full-time students is Student Legal Services.  
For any questions on your lease, contact 
Student Legal Services and set up an ap-pointment with a lawyer to help review it BEFORE you sign it.

or call 352-392-LAWS for more informa -
tion.

Having a roommate is a great 
way to divide the cost of liv -
ing off campus, but if you 
don’t find the right person to live with, living off- campus could be challenging.  Below are some tips that will help you if you are thinking about living with a roommate.
1.  Communication is key.  Talk about 
your budget for housing, expectations for safety, expectations for guests, and what your housing needs are before you even begin your search.  Being on the same page as your roommates will make your co-habitation experience much better and reduce the possibility of conflict. 
2.  Start with a friend or sibling.  These 
are often good options for roommates since you already know them.
3.  Consider a person you went to high 
school with or a friend you have made while here at UF.  
4. Before moving in, come to an agree -
ment about who will get which bedroom and bathroom along with which cabi-nets/storage space each person can use.
5.  Discuss how payment of rent and 
bills will take place.  Is each person re -sponsible for their own bills or will some -
one be in charge of collecting payment from each roommate?
6. Don’t have someone you want to 
live with?  Some apartment complexes offer “roommate matching” or “room-mate placement.”
 Roommate matching - You fill out 
a survey and management attempts to match you with like roommates based on the form
 Roommate placement – Apartment 
management places you in any open space they have available
7.  Make sure you can change apart-ments if the complex places you with roommates you are not compatible with.
8. Look for roommates on the Off 
Campus Housing Locator at: http://housing.offcampus.ufl.edu.
9.   Being friends with someone and 
living with a friend can be two totally dif-ferent things.  
See the Gator Guide to Off Campus 
Life for some tips on how to stay friends while living together at www.offcam-pus.ufl.edu/gatorguide.php  Roommates
Both personal and property safe -
ty is important as you search 
for off-campus housing.  Before 
signing a lease, check crime statistics in the area where you are thinking about living by visiting the Gainesville Police Department website www.gainesvillepd.org and clicking on the Crime Reports link. 
 This website will allow you to enter 
the address of the places where you are thinking about living and on a map the crime in the area will be displayed. Be -
low are five tips to use when looking at safety during your apartment search:
1. Go back to the complex at night.  
How do you feel?  How does the environ-ment seem?  Is the place well lit and populated or dark and isolated?2.  Does the property have working se -
curity gates and/or guards?
3. Check for dead bolts on the out-
side door, locks for individual doors, alarm systems, etc. and ask lots of ques-tions about the security.  Is there an ex-tra charge for a security system?
4.  Has there been crime in the area 
recently?  What actions have been done to prevent crime from happening?
5. Don’t forget about purchasing some 
Renter’s Insurance to protect you and your stuff from the unexpected.
Go to the Off Campus Life website at 
www.offcampus.ufl.edu/top10.php for 
more personal and property safety tips. Safety TipsYou can’t find the right place 
to live until you know how much you are able to spend.  
Here are some budget questions you should think about while touring a property:
1. What is the monthly rent?
2.  What’s included in that rent?  
Utilities, gas, water, cable, internet?
3.  What’s not included in rent?  
What is the average monthly cost for gas, electric, water, garbage disposal?  If management doesn’t know, contact GRU at www.gru.com and they can give you average costs of utilities for the previous year.
4.  Want to have a pet?  Factor in 
the deposit and monthly cost for food, medical, and grooming care.
5. Don’t forget the renter’s insur -
ance.  Before you sign your lease, call your insurance company and see how much it will cost monthly to insure your apartment or house.
6.  Are you going to need fuel for 
your vehicle or are you going to use the bus?  Factor in transportation/ car maintenance costs to your budget.
7. How much will you spend month-
ly on groceries or on a meal plan?
8. Have some fun!  Don’t spend 
so much on rent that you don’t have money for leisure time.
9. What do you spend on clothing, 
shoes, and accessories? 
10.  How much money can you
save every month?  It’s really good 
to save some money every month to cover unexpected emergency expens-es.  Even $20 a month saved is good.  Every little bit counts.
To help you with your budget, OCL 
has a budget spreadsheet in the 
Gator Guide that can be found online at www.offcampus.ufl.edu. Budgets

If you are thinking about renting a house or 
apartment, Renters Insurance provides impor -
tant coverage for both you and your posses-
sions. A standard Renter’s Policy protects your per -
sonal property in case of theft or damage and may pay for temporary living expenses if your rental is damaged (including loss of use). It can also shield you from personal liability. Anyone who leases a house or apartment should consider this type of coverage. 
Talk with your parents before getting your own 
renter’s policy.  If you are still financially dependent on your parents or a family member and they own a home, they might be able to cover you under their homeowner’s policy.  Some homeowner policies will cover a dependent’s rental property while in college.  
There are several types of Residential Insurance 
policies.  Read your policy information carefully and ensure you have full coverage.  Policies should in-clude the following items: 
 Fire or lightning 
  Windstorm or hail 
  Explosion 
  Aircraft 
  Vehicles 
  Smoke 
  Vandalism or malicious mischief 
  Theft 
  Damage by glass or safety-glazing material that  
     is part of a building 
  Falling objects 
  Water-related damage from home utilities 
  Electrical surge damage
Floods, earthquakes, and hurricanes aren’t on the 
list. If you live in an area prone to one or more of the three, you’ll need to buy a separate policy or a rider. In areas where hurricanes can pose a threat, you might also need to buy a separate rider to cover wind damage. 
Ask your insurance agent about this extra cover -
age.  Gainesville is prone to hurricanes and some ar -
eas flood.  Renter’s insurance will help to protect you and your stuff from the unexpected.Insurance

 Do read the lease and make 
sure you understand it.
   
 Do have a lawyer review the 
lease.
    Do expect to pay full rent, not 
just your share.  This is what “joint and several” liability means, a term included or implied in leases that list more than one tenant.
      Do obtain a copy of the lease 
and all attachments or adden-dums to the lease.
      Do have all promised repairs 
and improvements written into the lease and signed by the landlord.
      Do keep a copy of the lease 
and all the attachments or adden-dums with your important, perma-nent records.
      Do insist on seeing your ac-
tual unit.
     Do get clear written permis-
sion for any pets.
      Do check for maintenance 
responsibilities when renting a house or duplex.        Do not sign a 12-month lease 
unless you are willing to pay rent for 12 months.
      Do not sign a 12-month lease 
with roommates unless all room-mates are willing to pay rent for 12 months.
      Do not have your parents sign 
the lease or a parental guarantee agreeing to be responsible for rent.
      Do not sign a lease with an 
automatic renewal clause.
      Do not sign a lease that gives 
the landlord unlimited access to the apartment without notice or consent.
      Do not sign a lease based 
upon a model apartment.
      Do not sign a lease before vis-
iting the neighborhood at various times during the day, at night and on weekends.
     Do not sign a lease until all 
agreements negotiated with the landlord are in writing. In Gainesville, there is a glut of available 
apartments.  You should examine sev -
eral apartments before signing a lease.
 Function:  Check appliances, run water in 
all sinks, showers and tubs, flush toilets, and 
check air conditioning and heating.
 Appearance:  Is it clean?  Do the carpets 
look worn or smell bad?  Has the apartment been recently painted?  Do the walls have nail holes?
 Inventory: Note all defects on the inventory 
sheet or check-in list signed by the landlord or an impartial witness.  Photograph or videotape the apartment at move in.
 Application Deposits:  Never put down a 
deposit to hold an apartment unless you have a written agreement indicating whether it is re -
fundable.
 Cost:  Can you afford it?  Even if your room-
mates leave?
 Location:  Is the neighborhood safe?  Even 
at night?  Are you within easy walking or cycling distance of campus?  Are buses available?
 City Limits:  Gainesville protects tenants 
by enforcing housing codes.  The city will order landlords to make repairs. If a complaint is filed, Alachua County will inspect apartments and is-sue a report of violations. Model Apartments:  Never sign a lease 
based upon a model.  Insist on seeing your ac-tual apartment.   
 Pest Control:  Does the landlord maintain 
a regular spraying program?         
 Landlord:  Speak to tenants of the apart-
ment complex.  Does the landlord make a habit of unannounced entries?  Are repairs made quickly.  
 Noise and Parking:  Check for noise and 
parking problems by visiting the apartment at various times during the day, at night and on weekends.
 Safety:  Are there deadbolts on the doors?  
Are hallways and parking lots well lit?  If there are sliding glass doors, are there adequate locks to deter forced entry?  You can contact the Alachua County Sheriff’s Office or the Gainesville Police Department to obtain infor -
mation on crime in the area.
 Single-Family Housing:  The landlord may

TEEING OFF WITH KYLE MAISTRI THE GATORS GAINED 450 YARDS 
SATURDAY.
By TYLER JETT
Alligator Staff Writer
tjett@alligator.org
 
For once, the Gators were behind the 
curve.
This season’s offense (28.4 points per 
game) has been the least productive since 
Urban Meyer came to Gainesville in 2005. 
So Meyer, a coach often praised for creating matchup nightmares, studied the nation’s 
premier offenses and made sure to take 
notes.
In particular, Meyer was impressed with 
No. 1 Oregon, which leads the nation with an average of 572.9 yards and 54.9 points per game.
“I just see the evolution of the game right 
now,” Meyer said. “If you sit and watch a game on Saturday night and watch high-
lights, it’s pretty mesmerizing to watch 
Oregon play a college football game right now.”
Like the Ducks, Meyer wanted his team 
to frequently feature an athletic quarterback and call plays at a faster pace.
With an extra week to prepare for Flor -
ida’s eventual 34-31 win against Georgia, 
Meyer lightened quarterback John Brant-
ley’s workload. Brantley, who averages negative -8.8 rushing yards per game, has 
been ineffective running Florida’s signature 
option play.
By contrast, Oregon quarterback Darron 
Thomas ranks second on his team with 311 yards on the ground. And the Ducks are far from unique in that respect. A quarterback is at least the second-leading rusher on nine of the nation’s top-10 running teams.
To compensate for Brantley’s lack of 
mobility, the Gators relied heavily on Bur -
ton against the Bulldogs. Burton has been a prominent piece in UF’s offense all season, most notably in his six-touchdown perfor -
mance against Kentucky. 
But the freshman received 17 carries, 
GATORS IN THE NBA UF FOOTBALL
 Say what you will about Brad Childress, but the guy is a problem solver. 
There’s no way waiving one of the best receivers of all time doesn’t turn the 
Vikings’ season around. … LeBron James was very upset at rumors that he could be getting involved with Kim Kardashian after she attended the last Heat-Nets game. Seems warranted. That family never gets involved with black athletes. It was announced Monday that 
Florida and South Carolina will face off Nov. 13 at 7:15 p.m. in Ben Hill Griffin Stadium. The game will air on either ESPN or ESPN2. Former UF center and 2007 NBA Draft 
lottery pick Al Horford signed a five-year ex-tension worth $60 million plus performance bonuses with the Atlanta Hawks on Monday. Harrison Diamond / Alligator Staff
Freshman Trey Burton carried the ball a season-high 17 times against Georgia on Sat-urday, gaining 110 yards and scoring two touchdowns.
UF takes page from Oregon’s playbook
By MATT WATTS
Alligator Writer
 
It’s almost time. 
After an unsettling end to 
last season, the Gators women’s basketball team spent the sum-mer in flux. 
A new assistant coach and six 
new players have been hard at 
work trying to improve a team 
that finished near the bottom of the Southeastern Conference with a 15-17 record and failed to 
make the NCAA Tournament.
“Certainly we’re very aware 
of the countdown. It’s closing 
in on us quickly,” said coach Amanda Butler of the limited amount of practice time remain-ing before the regular season 
begins Nov. 13. 
The team held a scrimmage 
in Sunday’s practice, and Butler 
pointed out strong individual 
performances from some of her 
young players.
Freshman forward Deaundra 
Young, who has been battling range-of-motion issues due to 
offseason surgery, led the team 
in rebounds. Fellow freshman Kayla Lewis was also acknowl-edged for her play.
“[I] feel really good about 
the fact that we’re getting better every day,” Butler said.
“And with our youth, that’s 
what we’re striving to do.”
A position of interest 
throughout offseason workouts 
has been the point guard 
slot. Junior 
Jordan Jones, whose skills 
are better utilized in a 
shooter’s role, 
is the only 
Gators guard returning from last season.
Enter junior transfer Lanita 
Bartley and freshman Jaterra Bonds. They represent two of the Gators’ five new guards and have brought life to the position 
and the team.
“I’ll tell you, those two jok-
ers are just battling it out every 
day,” Butler said. “It seems to 
go back and forth, possession 
by possession. It’s exciting to have that type of competition and depth, true depth, quality depth, at the position.”
The presence of Bartley and 
Bonds will allow Jones to settle in at shooting guard, although Butler said the two newcomers 
could see the floor at the same Young players emerging as season nearsSEE FOOTBALL, p AGE 28
SEE WHOOpS, p AGE 28Urban Meyer dropped 
to his knees, a fan base exhaled and the Gators 
finally smiled after their win against the Bulldogs on Satur -
day.
Now, everyone should take 
a giant step back.
Yes, Florida’s victory over 
Georgia was one of the most exciting in the rivalry’s histo-ry, and it popped the immense 
pressure bubble that came 
with losing three straight and falling from the top-25 rank-ings.
Meyer said the game was 
the biggest of his six-year ten-ure at UF, and he went a step 
f u r t h e r M o n d a y 
with this 
tongue-in-cheek response: 
“Great-
est win. All time. H i s t o r y of the

But even after their tri-
umph, the Gators are still a 
middling, unranked team 
coming off a nail-biting, over -
time win against a mediocre 
opponent.
To their credit, they seem 
to understand that. Meyer said his players are carrying themselves with the same ur -
gency they had going into the 
UGA game, and quarterback 
John Brantley backed up that sentiment.
“We have to concentrate 
on Vanderbilt and know that, hey, just because we beat Georgia doesn’t mean we’re world-beaters,” Brantley said. “We have to keep going, keep 
practicing hard like we did Gators

eight more than his previous sea-
son high, and led all rushers with 
110 yards Saturday. Redshirt fresh-
man Jordan Reed also lined up at 
quarterback for two plays, plung-
ing up the middle for 19 yards.
For the first time this season, 
the quarterback rotation occurred not only between plays but often less than 10 seconds before the ball was snapped. Burton would line 
up in the shotgun before shifting 
to another position as Brantley ran behind center.
The quick switch was done to 
keep defenses off balance. Oppo-nents often focus on stopping the 
option with Burton in the game, 
leaving receivers with one-on-one coverage.
“When I come back in, hopeful-
ly that doesn’t allow them to make their checks,” Brantley said. “And 
that’s what we’re hoping for: the 
matchups outside.”
Florida also abstained from 
huddling at times Saturday. Meyer has experimented with no-huddle offenses in the past, such as the 
short-lived Bonzai package last 
season. But with leaders like Tim Tebow on the team, Meyer thought 
bringing players together between 
each play was valuable.
Center Mike Pouncey said the 
team’s fast tempo exhausted Geor -gia’s defensive line, and Burton, who was untouched on his 51-yard touchdown run in the fourth quar -
ter, agreed.
“It’s probably one of the coolest things I’ve ever done on offense,” he said. “We try to snap the ball as fast as we can. It wears the de-
fense down, as you guys can see. 
The first quarter, they were done. They were about to tap out after a while.”

safety Jonathan Dowling has been kicked off the team for violating un-specified rules, Meyer said. Dowl-ing, the nation’s No. 16 athlete in the 2010 recruiting class, according

Oregon took a giant step in its 
quest for a national champion-

We know Black-

game against Kansas State 
because of a DUI. For that he 
took a one-spot dive in the 
standings, but his video game-

keep him alive in the race. 
After jumping out to the lead in 
our ﬁ  rst Heisman Watch of the season, Robinson has plunged in the standings due to injuries. But he turned in a strong showing in a loss Saturday against Penn 
State with 190 passing yards, 191 rushing yards and four total touchdowns.This is what happens when you throw an in-
terception, Kellen. You drop in our standings. 
Moore dropped from second to third after 
throwing just his second interception of the 
season Tuesday against Louisiana Tech. We know that’s harsh, but we have high stan-
dards here at alligatorSports. To be fair, Moore does lead the nation in passing efﬁ  ciency and is completing passes at nearly a 70 percent clip. So he’s still pretty good, which is why he’s third on the list.What can’t this man do? Newton added 
a receiving touchdown to his Heisman candidacy Saturday against Ole Miss. Oh yeah, he also threw for 209 yards and two touchdowns against the Rebels. This is the third consecutive week Newton 
has been atop our Heisman standings and it will stay 
that way for the rest of the season if he maintains 
this level of play.

Junior Jordan Jones is the only UF guard returning from last season. She will see more time at shoot-
ing guard this year with five new guards on the team. 
Gators to scrimmage this weekend to prep for Knights in preseason NIT
time as well. 
It’s part of the coaching staff’s 
commitment to quality minutes, 
disregarding the perceived impor -
tance of starting status.
“We’re really deemphasizing 
starting and really trying to focus more on who’s going to be on the 
floor longer, who can we count on in certain game situations,” Butler said. 
“As a player, I think I’d much 
rather be the kid that finished, that was in those situations at the end.”
Florida will hold another scrim-
mage at the end of the week in 
preparation for the season opener 
against UCF in the first round of the Preseason Women’s National Invita-tion Tournament. 
But Butler knows she can’t truly 
evaluate the team’s progress and ex-pectations until the real action gets underway. 
“Ultimately, playing games is 
the measuring stick,” Butler said. “Starting with Central Florida, who is more of a veteran team, it’s going to be great for us right out of the gate.”
Butler singled out her younger 
players, saying that the quick turn-arounds and limited practice time in between games in a tournament for -
mat will bring valuable experience 
to a group desperately seeking it.
“We’ve got a group of kids that’s 
very focused on trying to win a 
championship,” Butler said. “We’re 
not going to use any excuses for the 
mistakes that we make, although they’re certainly going to happen.”W-HOOPS , from page 27
this past two weeks with that chip on our shoulder.”
Florida players have taken the one-week-at-a-time, we-
can-lose-to-anyone approach in interviews for as long as I 
can remember, but this year it actually seems true.
It wouldn’t be shocking to see Florida lose to Vander -
bilt, especially if it comes out thinking all is right with 
the world because it isn’t on a losing streak anymore after 
beating Georgia.
And the truth is, that losing streak could very, very 
easily have been stretched to four games.The Gators gave up 21 points in the fourth quarter and 
439 yards overall, and their two biggest defensive plays 
— Will Hill’s two interceptions — came off deflections. 
Hill said the one in overtime “fell in my lap,” and on the 
ensuing UF possession, Brantley should have been picked off when he threw to Chris Rainey on a fade route, which is meant for tall people.
Then, after not letting Trey Burton throw the ball down 
field in more than a month, UF’s coaches chose third down in overtime as the right moment to try it out, and they’re lucky no UGA corner was prepared for his lob pass out 
into the flat.
A play later, Chas Henry’s game-winning field goal barely got past Georgia stud receiver A.J. Green, whose 
leap at the line of scrimmage had the height to block it but was about a foot and a half to the left.
“I could feel the wind from the ball,” Green said.If those bounces and breaks go the other way, the talk 
around Gainesville would be of the uphill battle for bowl eligibility, not the Southeastern Conference Champion-
ship that Florida could still win.
With that said, every game has those moments, and 
the Gators did show they have a pulse. That’s the most 
important thing to take away from this game: they’re ca-
pable of not being bad.
But they still aren’t good, yet.MIKE , from page 27“Ultimately, playing games is

Arkansas had the UF women’s 
cross country team beat with 400 meters to go. 
After becoming disorganized 
following the first mile of the Southeastern Conference Cross Country Championships 6K race, the Gators were in trouble.
“We saw Arkansas ahead of 
us and we knew that we had to get ahead of them to win,” senior Charlotte Browning said.
Along the final stretch of Hilton Field at Columbia, S.C., though, 
Browning and four other Florida 
runners made critical passes on 
Arkansas runners to claim a one-
point victory and their second consecutive SEC championship 
Monday.
“Having it so close makes it 
even more exciting,” Browning 
said.
The Gators’ 61-60 victory 
against the Razorbacks was sealed by Browning’s 21:11.13 run and 
third-place finish, as well as senior 
Rebecca Lowe’s sixth-place finish four seconds later in her first cross 
country race of the season. 
Both runners worked off each 
other’s pace to stay in the front after the split at the first mile, which caused most of the Gators 
to string out among the field of 12 
teams. 
For their efforts, Browning and 
Lowe were named first-team All-
SEC selections, while junior Gen-
evieve LaCaze 
made the All-
SEC second team after her 21:16.10 
run and eighth-
place finish.
The close 
race wasn’t Browning’s first of the season as she also had to rally 
on Oct. 2 at the Wisconsin adidas 
Invitational to hold a one-second 
victory. “I don’t think anybody 
could’ve predicted the kind of 
things that have gone on during 
the fall,” UF cross country coach 
Todd Morgan said. “They have just really responded tremen-
dously today with their backs 
against the wall.”
The women’s race was won 
individually by Georgia’s Kristie Krueger, who outpaced Browning 
by 30 seconds with her 20:41.25 
mark. 
The No. 26 men’s team also 
struggled early against No. 10 Arkansas in the 8K men’s race. 
Unlike the women, the men could 
not bring themselves back into 
the race as the Razorbacks cruised to a 35-point victory against the 
third-place Gators. 
First-year runner and first-
team All-SEC selection Dumisane 
Hlaselo turned in a fifth-place performance and  finished first 
for Florida for the third time this 
season after his 24:08.32 time.
Alabama came in second as 
a team, while Barnabus Kirui of Ole Miss won the third individual 
SEC Championship of his career 
with a 23:52.07 run.
“[The UF men’s team} pushed 
Alabama to the limit,” Morgan said. “They ran solidly. Unfortu-
nately, a couple of guys had off 
days but then a couple of guys 
stepped up.”Gators women win second straight SEC championship
Moss
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
 
EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. — Randy Moss’s 
reunion with the Minnesota Vikings lasted 25 
days — and three disappointing losses.
Vikings players confirmed Monday that 
coach Brad Childress informed them during 
a team meeting that Moss had been let go, a few minutes after the NFL Network first re-
ported the Vikings had waived the frustrated wide receiver less than a month after acquir -
ing him in a trade with New England.
Childress and team officials didn’t im-
mediately respond to messages seeking 
confirmation of the decision. About an hour 
before the news came out, Childress took 12 consecutive questions from reporters during his regular news conference about Moss, his effort, and his mindset in response to a rant 
by Moss following Sunday night’s loss to the 
Patriots.Moss, who was fined $25,000 last week for 
failing to cooperate with the media and make himself regularly available for interviews, stepped to the podium after the game but an-nounced he wouldn’t take any questions. He repeatedly expressed admiration for coach Bill Belichick and his former team, the Patri-
ots, and criticized the Vikings for not taking 
enough of his game-planning advice.
Moss, who cost the Vikings a third-round 
draft pick, had only one catch for 8 yards against the Patriots. In four games for the Vikings, he had 13 catches for 174 yards and two touchdowns.
Childress didn’t mention the move and 
said Moss was staying back in the Boston area for a few days to spend time with family. Asked whether he regretted acquiring Moss, the coach said “not at present.”
Moss, who was traded away from Minne-
sota in 2005 after finding his share of trouble and frustrating the organization with his at-titude, expressed eagerness to connect with quarterback Brett Favre when he arrived and talked about how much he still loved Vikings 
fans some 5 1/2 years after his departure.
While his presence opened the field for 
wide receiver Percy Harvin, who has blos-
somed into one of the league’s most danger -
ous offensive players, Moss never materialized into the deep threat the Vikings 
sought when they traded 
for him. His longest catch was a 37-yarder, and he 
was only targeted twice against the Patriots.
“I’m definitely down 
that we lost this game. I didn’t expect we’d lose this game,” Moss said. “I don’t know how many more times I’ll be in New England 
again. But I leave coach Belichick and those guys with a salute: ‘I love you guys. I miss 
you. I’m out.’”
Childress said Monday he didn’t see 
Moss’s remarks as “incendiary.” The closest he came to criticizing him was acknowledg-ing he could’ve caught a pass that fell incom-plete in the end zone while the Patriots were called for pass interference.
“But again, I don’t know,” Childress said. 
“He was restricted. If they called pass inter -
ference, there had to be some kind of restric-tion.”
Asked whether he felt Moss had been 
playing hard, Childress said, “He’s playing hard when he needs to play hard.”
Linebacker Ben Leber said players were 
surprised by the news. But he didn’t sound 
happy about Moss’s post-game remarks.
“It was just, ‘Wow,’” Leber said. “Just be-
cause it sounded like it was unprompted and 
sounded like he wanted to get some stuff off 
his chest. He certainly has every right to do 
that. I don’t think that’s the way to do it.”

JACKSONVILLE — Jacksonville Jaguars 
coach Jack Del Rio dangled carrots in front of 
his players last week, telling them what the bye week would be like with a win and with 
a loss.
They responded with their most complete 
victory of the season at Dallas.
David Garrard had the best game of his 
career, Maurice Jones-Drew turned in his best 
performance of the season, and Jacksonville’s oft-criticized defense came up with a fran-chise-record four interceptions and a pivotal goal-line stand.
The 35-17 victory wasn’t nearly as close as 
the final score indicated, and it prompted Del Rio to give players five days off during the team’s bye week.
“Winning makes everything better,” Del 
Rio said Monday. “The steak tastes better, the beer seems like it’s a little bit colder and ev-erything’s better when you win.”
The lopsided victory followed two one-sid-
ed losses and evened Jacksonville’s record at 4-4 at the midway point of the season. It’s not where Del Rio would like to be, but it’s good enough to keep the Jaguars in the hunt in the competitive AFC South.
“The way I look at it is it’s a win we had to 
have and we got it,” Del Rio said. 
“There are a lot of other wins we’re going to 
have to have starting with the next one. As you 
go through the first half of the season, you’d 
like to remain alive and have some hope.
“I’d love to be 8-0 right now and running 
away with it, but that’s not the situation. So, you take where you are and make the most of it.”
Jacksonville still has four division games 
remaining and plenty of time to make up ground on Indianapolis, Houston and Tennes-
see.
The Jaguars can only hope for more efforts 
like they had against the Cowboys.
Garrard completed his first 12 passes, fi-nally misfiring in the third quarter to avoid a 
sack, and finished 17 of 21 for 260 yards. He had a career-best four TD passes and walked in for another score.
Even with three sacks and a lost fumble, 
Garrard’s passer rating was 157.8 — just shy of perfect (158.3) and tops in his nine-year ca-reer.
“We have to be able to build on it,” Garrard 
said after the game. “We can’t just have one big game and turn around the other way. We have to be able to build on the confidence that we have now.”
In Jacksonville’s four wins, Garrard has 12 
touchdown passes and only one interception. In the four losses, he has one touchdown pass and six interceptions.
Garrard’s inconsistency is one reason the 
Jaguars have been blown out four times this season. When he’s on, it makes things easier on everyone around him, especially Jones-Drew.
Jones-Drew ran for 135 yards, his most 
since getting 177 on the ground against Ten-nessee last November.
The defense may have been the biggest 
bright spot for Jacksonville. The unit didn’t have a turnover in its previous three games but picked off four of Jon Kitna’s passes. 
Maybe even more crucial to the outcome, 
the Jaguars kept Marion Barber out of the end zone on consecutive plays late in the first 
half.
Leading 14-3 in the final seconds of the 
half, Jacksonville stuffed Barber on third and 
fourth down. 
The Jaguars scored touchdowns on their 
first two drives of the third quarter, and the outcome was never in doubt again.
“It was a really big play,” linebacker Daryl 
Smith said after the game. 
“We just had to have it. If you look at some 
of our other games this year, we’ve been put into similar situations and they’ve been scor -
ing. We’ve been in that situation enough times where something had to go good.”30, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 2, 2010

Vanderbilt will enter Saturday’s game against Florida 
shorthanded.
Running back Warren Norman will miss the remain-
der of the season after undergoing surgery on a dislo-
cated right wrist he suffered Saturday in a loss against 
Arkansas.
“He dislocated his wrist and is going to have to have 
pins and screws and everything,” coach Robbie Caldwell said.
Norman led the Commodores in rush-
ing with 459 yards and four touchdowns. 
The sophomore also returned kicks and averaged 25.4 yards per return.
To fill the hole left by Norman, the Commodores will 
turn to sophomore Zac Stacy , who has racked up 340 rushing yards this season. 
Also, quarterback Larry Smith can help in the run 
game, as he has run for 351 yards in eight games.
“We have pretty good playmakers in the offense,” 
Stacy said. “I’m just going to do as well as I can to help the team be successful.”Vanderbilt loses

ARLINGTON, Texas — The 
prize that eluded Willie and Barry 
at long last belongs to the San Fran-cisco Giants, thanks to a band of self-described castoffs and misfits and their shaggy-haired ace.
Tim Lincecum, Edgar Renteria 
and the Giants won the World Se-ries on Monday night, beating the Texas Rangers 3-1 in a tense Game 5 and taking the trophy home to the city by the Bay for the first time.
It was an overdue victory — 
the Giants last wore the crown in 1954, four years before they moved west. So much for a franchise that never quite got it done in October despite the likes of baseball giants Willie Mays, Barry Bonds and Juan Marichal. It’s November, and now new names stand tall in San Fran-cisco. 
”This buried a lot of bones — ‘62, 
‘89, 2002,” Giants general manager Brian Sabean said, ticking off losing Series appearances. “This group deserved it, faithful from the begin-ning. We’re proud and humbled by the achievement.”
Lincecum outdueled Cliff Lee in an every-pitch-matters matchup that was scoreless until Renteria hit 
a stunning three-run homer with 
two outs in the seventh inning. Nel-
son Cruz homered in the bottom 
half, but Lincecum returned to his 
wicked self and preserved the lead.
Lincecum won this game of 
Texas Hold ‘em, beating Lee for the second time in a week. The two-
time NL Cy Young winner gave up 
three hits over eight innings and 
struck out 10.
Brian Wilson 
closed for a save, 
completing a 
surprising romp 
through the post-
season for a pitch-
ing-rich team that 
waited until the 
final day to clinch a playoff spot.
Manager Bruce Bochy enjoys 
calling his Giants a ragtag bunch. 
Maybe Cody Ross, Aubrey Huff 
and Freddy Sanchez fit that de-scription.
But the foundation of this club — 
for now, for the foreseeable future 
— is totally home grown, built on a 
deep, talented and young rotation, 
a rookie catcher with star potential and their bearded closer.
Renteria reprised his role of 
postseason hero. His 11th-inning 
single ended Game 7 of the 1997 World Series and lifted Florida over 
Cleveland. Forget that he made the 
last out in the 2004 Series that fin-
ished Boston’s sweep of St. Louis — this journeyman’s path led to an-other title, helped by his go-ahead 
home run in Game 2.
A team seemingly free of egos 
did everything right to take the 
lead. Ross, the surprising MVP of the NL Championship Series, stayed square and hit a leadoff sin-gle, and Juan Uribe followed with another hit up the middle.
That put a runner at second 
base for the first time in the game and brought up Huff, who led the Giants in home runs this year. So what did he do? He expertly put down the first sacrifice bunt of his career.
Lee struck out Pat Burrell to keep 
the runners put, but Ross began hopping home as soon as Rente-ria connected, sending a drive that kept sailing and landed over the left-center field wall.
And just like that, all the Giants’ 
past troubles seemed like ancient history. San Francisco wins World Series

Timberwolves forward Michael Beasley played his first two seasons in Miami before 
being traded this offseason. 
nAtionAl BASKEtBAll ASSociA tion
tHE ASSociA tED PRESS
 
MIAMI — Michael Beasley spent two years 
learning the nuances of NBA play from Udo-
nis Haslem, and quietly showed appreciation this summer for those countless lessons.
It was at the funeral for Haslem’s mother. 
Barely three weeks after being traded from Miami — months of pleas to stay with the Heat having ultimately fallen on deaf ears — Beasley quietly and somewhat unexpectedly returned to stand by the player who always stood by him.
“That says a lot about Beas,” Haslem said. 
“He could have just got as far away as he 
could from Miami and never looked back.”
These days, Beasley isn’t looking back at 
much of anything.
Determined to embrace a new opportu-
nity in Minnesota, Beasley returns to Miami 
for the first time as an opponent on Tuesday night when he and the Timberwolves (1-2) get their first live look at the rebuilt Heat (3-1).
“I don’t really worry about too much in the 
past,” said Beasley , the No. 2 pick in the 2008 draft who leads Minnesota in scoring so far at 14.7 points per game. “The Miami Heat is in my past. The Timberwolves are my future. This is just another regular away game. This is a game we’ve got to win.”
It’s been an adjustment, Beasley getting 
used to Minnesota. The Wolves run a triangle offense, which is complex to learn, and Beas-
ley acknowledges that process is ongoing.
But fitting into the locker room has been 
easy for Beasley , and his lighthearted ways 
have been embraced.
“He’s been great. He’s been absolutely 
nothing but great,” Minnesota coach Kurt Rambis said. “He has an enthusiasm for life and an ability to play basketball. He feels like he was just born to play basketball. He loves playing, he loves practicing and he’s the guy who keeps our locker room loose. And I’m asking him to do very difficult things. He’s 
got a long learning process in front of him.”
To portray the Beasley trade as one where 
Miami got nothing in return besides second-
round picks in 2011 and 2014 would be a bit unfair. It could be argued that Miami got most 
of its team — Mike Miller, Eddie House, Ju-
wan Howard, Zydrunas Ilgauskas, Haslem and others — in the deal.
Without trimming Beasley’s $5 million sal-
ary from this season’s books, it would have been immeasurably harder for the Heat to have room to attract the cast that’ll surround LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh. Even though Beasley had no shortage 
of issues in Miami — getting kicked out of 
the rookie symposium in 2008 for breaking league rules, spending much of the summer of 2009 in a Houston rehabilitation center, and a few posts on Twitter that further harmed his reputation — the Heat always raved about his talent.
“People forget what it was like when we 
won 15 games,” Heat President Pat Riley said 
as the 2010 offseason started. “Ever since Mi-
chael’s been drafted, he seems to be the most maligned player in the NBA. And we won an average of 45 games in two years, made the playoffs both years, and he was our second-leading scorer.”
Riley told Beasley that the team expected 
more from him, and Beasley responded by saying he expected more from himself.
But in the end, the dollars were the decid-
er, and cap space turned out to be what Mi-ami needed most from the enigmatic former Kansas State star.
“Congratulations,” Haslem recalled telling 
Beasley when the trade got done. “Go to an-other team and be the All-Star that you have the capability of being.”
Beasley might need an All-Star effort just 
to score against the Heat.
In Miami’s last two games, opposing start-
ers at forward — Rashard Lewis and Quentin 
Richardson for Orlando on Friday, then Tra-
vis Outlaw and Joe Smith for New Jersey on Sunday — have missed every shot they’ve tried against the Heat, that foursome combin-ing to miss all 21 of their field goal attempts.
“They use their length. They use their ath-
letic ability,” Beasley said. “They’re using ev-erything they’ve got. They’ve got two of the top-five defenders in the NBA.”Beasley makes first

PULLED WITH 1:50 LEFT IN THE GAME SUNDAY.

ASHBURN, Va. — Mike Sha-
nahan changed his story in a hurry. The new explanation: Donovan McNabb was benched more because of his body, not his brain.
Less than 24 hours after de-
claring he yanked McNabb be-cause of a “gut feel” relating to the quarterback’s less-than-full competence in the offense, the Washington Redskins coach in-stead insisted Monday it was a pre-planned move that had more to do with “cardiovascular en-durance” issues.
McNabb, because of nagging 
hamstring and groin injuries, wasn’t in good enough shape to run a two-minute offense with no timeouts, according to Shanahan.
“The cardiovascular endur -ance that it takes to run a two-minute (drill), going all the way down with no timeouts, calling plays, it’s just not easy.” Shana-han said. “If I thought it was the best situation to do, then Dono-van would have run the two-min-ute offense.”
Somewhere in between the 
range of explanations is the cold fact: McNabb, who turns 34 this month, is not having a very good season.
The change of message by a 
coach with two Super Bowl titles made for a baffling day at Red-skins Park, nearly eclipsing the stunning decision to sit McNabb in the first place.
With the Redskins trailing the 
Detroit Lions by six with 1:50 to play, Shanahan pulled McNabb in favor of Rex Grossman. It didn’t work. The backup’s first snap of the season turned into a touch-down for the other team, with Grossman fumbling the ball on a blindside sack and Ndamukong Suh returning it for the score.Detroit won 37-25, leaving the 
Redskins (4-4) at .500 and still competitive in the NFC East as they enter their bye week, assum-ing they can figure out what’s happening between coach and quarterback.
After the game, Shanahan jus-
tified the move by citing the 
complexities of the two-minute offense. The game speeds up. Multiple plays have to be called at the line of scrimmage. 
It all has “to come automati-cally,” the coach said. Grossman spent last season in this same of-fense under offensive coordina-tor Kyle Shanahan — both were with the Houston Texans — al-though Grossman was a rarely used backup who didn’t run the two-minute offense in a regular-season game.
Teammates could hardly be-lieve it.
“For him to be pulled like that, 
it’s definitely a shocker to a lot of us,” cornerback DeAngelo Hall said. “It does raise the interesting point: After the season, will he be here or not?”
If McNabb hasn’t grasped the 
offense enough to run a two-minute drill after seven months of study, there seemed to be only three possible conclusions: The offense is too complex, the coach-es have done a poor job teaching it, or McNabb is a poor student.
Or a combination of the three. 
One of the knocks on McNabb in his 11 years with the Philadelphia Eagles was his struggles in the two-minute offense, which came to light most embarrassingly when he took his time leading a drive late in the Super Bowl with his team trailing and the clock ticking away.
But one should always expect 
the unexpected with the Red-skins. Shanahan came up with a fourth explanation: cardio.Shanahan said McNabb, who 
has two tight hamstrings, a sore groin and a bruised shin, hasn’t been able to practice the two-min-ute drill for five weeks. The coach said he even called the quarter -
back into the office last week and discussed the possibility of Mc-Nabb sitting out the game.
“I can see you’re not setting 
your feet like you normally do when you’re throwing the ball,” Shanahan said he told McNabb.
It was decided that McNabb 
would play, but Shanahan said he decided before kickoff that he would pull his starter if there were a two-minute situation with no timeouts. The coach said he didn’t inform McNabb of this de-cision because he said he didn’t want to put the thought into Mc-Nabb’s mind.
Asked why he didn’t explain 
all this after the game on Sunday, Shanahan said he “didn’t really want to go into a lot of detail” in the disappointment following a loss.
