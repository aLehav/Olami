  On Saturday, the Gators did 
the same things they had done 
all season. 
 They ran the ball effectively,   
the defense came up with time-ly turnovers and the pass rush  showed talent and depth. 
  They won ugly.  But what made No. 7 Flor-
ida’s (8-1, 7-1 Southeastern Conference) 14-7 win against Missouri different from its ﬁ  rst seven victories was that when the Gators left the ﬁ  eld, they weren’t in total control of their postseason future.
  As a result of Georgia’s 37-
10 victory against Ole Miss on Saturday, Florida needs UGA to lose to SEC West bottom feeder Auburn next week. A Bulldogs win keeps the Gators from achieving their primary goal: playing for the SEC champion-ship in Atlanta. 
  Still, coach Will Muschamp 
was pleased with UF’s effort against Missouri (4-5, 1-5 SEC) and throughout conference play. The 2012 Gators are the 12th team in school history to win seven conference games.
  “That’s a credit to those play-
ers,” Muschamp said of the seven-win mark. “It’s a credit to buying in, to hanging together, to facing adversity, to facing a tough schedule ... and bouncing back after a tough week. Really proud of the players, and we did what we had to do to win the football game.”
  As was the case in each of 
the ﬁ  rst eight games this sea-son, Florida was outgained in the ﬁ  rst quarter on Saturday, albeit by a slim margin of 72-69. UF also came back from a half-time deﬁ  cit for the fourth time MORE OF THE SAME

As Friday’s Gator Growl ap-
proaches, organizers are push-
ing a program that would donate even more to its philanthropy , the Wounded Warrior Project.
If 32,500 tickets are sold, then 
Gator Growl will donate $25,000 to the organization, which sup-ports veterans. After that amount is reached, 75 percent of each ticket sold will go to the group.
“We know The Gator Nation can 
raise a lot for our wounded war-riors,” said Severin Walstad, 21, as-sociate producer of sales for Gator Growl.
As of Friday morning, 15,000 
tickets had already been sold, Wal-stad said, which is average for being a week away from the event.
The past three years, 26,000 to 
35,000 tickets were sold, he said.
Tickets are $15 for UF students, 
$20 for UF faculty and staff and $25 for general public.
Gator Growl has set up a pro-
gram where anyone can buy tickets for wounded veterans or their fam-ily members. About 300 of those tickets have been sold so far.
Walstad said it makes sense to 
continue with Gator Growl’s theme of “United We Growl” and support veterans.
“V eterans are such an integral 
part of The Gator Nation already ,” he said.

On the last day of early voting, Gainesville resi-
dents lingered in a block-long line to cast their bal-
lots.
Some people waited in line for 15 minutes Satur-
day, while others waited for more than two hours.
More than 39,000 people voted early at the three 
polling locations, said Pam Carpenter, county su-pervisor of elections. The county saw fewer voters than the 2008 presidential election, which drew a crowd of about 53,000 people.
“We’ve seen a real reduction,” Carpenter said. 
“This seems to indicate it is the number of days that increase the number of early voting.”
Last year, Florida’s Republican-heavy legisla-
ture slashed the number of early voting days al-most in half, from 14 days to eight. This decision led Florida’s Democratic Party to ﬁ  le a lawsuit late Saturday, asking for extended voting hours in cer-tain counties, according to the Associated Press.
Carpenter said election ofﬁ  ces still had 96 hours 
of early voting, but the poll hours were compressed into fewer days with longer hours to compensate for the cutback.
“It was still a great turnout for the eight days,” 
she said.
The most popular voting location was the Mill-
hopper Branch Library with 15,597 votes, followed by 12,073 votes at the Tower Road Branch Library and 11,602 at the Supervisor of Elections Ofﬁ  ce, County Administration Building location, Carpen-ter said.
Gator alumna Cynthia Plunkett left the polls 
with her 8-year-old sister, Shea, Saturday after-noon. Plunkett said voting early turned into an un-expected family affair.
“We were all together and didn’t plan on going 
to the game,” the 23-year-old said. “We waited in Early voting drew about 40,000

The smell of vegetarian food and 
the sound of miniature hand cym-
bals filled the air Saturday around the Gainesville Krishna House dur -
ing its Musical Meditation Festival.
More than 100 people attended 
the festival, at which devotees con-ducted Gainesville Krishna’s first 12-hour Kirtan, or chanting for the glorification of God, said chaplain Carl Woodham.
Tulsi Rani, 26, a six-month mem-
ber of the Gainesville Krishna, smiled as she danced around the lawn to the chanting of the Hare Krishna mantra.
“It’s wonderful to come together 
and chant,” she said. “These words are filled with such a high spiritu-al frequency that it improves your mood no matter what.”
Inside the house, barefooted 
guests sat on gray mats playing in-struments and chanting the mantra into three microphones.
A TV displayed the translated 
lyrics as “O Lord, O Energy of the Lord. Please engage me in Your ser -
vice.”
A variety of people led the man-
tra with their own rhythms and melodies for 30-minute segments, but everyone sang the same words. 
Rani said the words were so 
powerful that it wasn’t tiring to sing the spiritual message all day.
Frank Orlando, a 33-year-old 
family medical doctor from Jackson-ville, said the spirituality of the Kir -
tan wasn’t just being experienced by those who were singing. 
The trees, everyone walking out-side and the animals were all cel-ebrating, said Orlando, who also goes by Dina Bandhu das.
“It’s a philosophy that an individ-
ual of any religion can experience,” 
he said. “It brought me happiness.”
“Singing and dancing are the 
basic forms of human expression,” 
said Michele Lis, a 20-year-old UF anthropology junior. “I love that this allows us to express together.”
The devotees are currently ob-
serving the month of Kartik, a month where every devotional act is expanded, and there is more spiritu-al benefit from everything a person does, Lis said.
“Doing this Kirtan during Kartik 
just makes everything and everyone more uplifted,” she said.
Nov. 5, 1975: The UF Animal Research Depart-
ment reported they had to use their rhesus monkeys 
in more than one experiment. The need came as a re-sult of the rising cost of the monkeys — from about $125 to $450 — in just two years. Since researchers could not afford to buy more monkeys, which are ideal subjects for the experiments, they had to use the 300 they had in multiple experiments. 
Nov. 6, 1981: UF administrators agreed to pay 
federal officials $650,000 in penalties for alleged bookkeeping violations made in 1977. An audit of UF bookkeeping revealed federal money spent on grant-sponsored research was inaccurately recorded, resulting in about a $2 million error. 
Nov. 6, 1997: UF architecture students sent a peti-
tion to UF President John Lombardi requesting ad-ministration do something about a pigeon problem in the architecture building. Pigeons plaguing the build-ing would get caught in the hall ceilings, where they would excrete feces, breed or even die. According to a letter from university administration, the $30,000 needed to prevent the birds from getting in the build-ing was not available in the budget.
Nov. 9, 2000: The results of the presidential elec-
tion between George W. Bush and Al Gore remained unknown. After the Nov. 7 election, the difference be-tween Bush and Gore was about 1,800 votes in Flor -
ida, which required a recount by state voting laws. An unofficial recount reported the candidates were actually as close as about 300 votes.

UF art senior Layne Thue voted 
at the downtown location with her father Saturday.
The 21-year-old said the wait 
was about 45 minutes to cast her vote.
Although the number of early 
voters dwindled, she said the num-ber of absentee ballots in Alachua County increased from 2008 num-bers.
“Absentee voting was over 
23,000,” Carpenter said.
Carpenter said absentee ballots 
will still be accepted until Tuesday at 7 p.m. to the Alachua County Su-pervisor of Elections Office. They can be mailed in or turned in by the individual in person.4, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, NOVEMBER 5, 2012

Daylight saving time ended Sunday at 2 a.m. Clocks in every state 
except Hawaii and Arizona and about 70 countries were set an hour earlier. There will be darker evenings and lighter mornings until March.
Daylight saving time is traditionally observed from the second 
Sunday in March to the first Sunday in November.
Modern-day daylight saving time was first proposed in 1895 by 
entomologist George Vernon Hudson, who wanted to have more light during summer evenings to gather bugs.
In 1916, Austria and Germany became the first countries to imple-
ment daylight saving time. The U.S. adopted it during World War I and repealed it after the war ended.
During World War II, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt brought 
daylight saving time back and called it “War Time.” The U.S. of-ficially adopted daylight saving time during the 1960s.

The pancreas transplant program at 
UF&Shands has reopened and is accepting 
patients.
The United Network for Organ Shar -
ing approved the program’s reactivation Oct. 22, according to a press release from UF&Shands.
UF&Shands voluntarily suspended its 
adult and pediatric liver transplant pro-grams and pancreas transplant program after losing surgeons to other medical in-stitutions in August 2011, according to the release.
The reactivation was made possible af-ter Shands hired two surgeons to join UF College of Medicine’s Department of Sur -
gery this summer: Dr. Kenneth Andreoni and Dr. Brendan Boland.
The liver transplant program became 
active again in April, according to the press release.
Andreoni said Shands is currently 
working on rebuilding its transplant wait-ing list.
“We had some folks who wanted to 
wait,” he said. “Several of the others trans-ferred their time back to us.”
He said the hospital now has four ab-
dominal transplant surgeons, who perform pancreas, kidney and liver transplants.
Andreoni said other programs typically perform between eight and 12 transplants a year, but Shands was sometimes able to double that number.
With the program’s reactivation, he said 
he is hoping to average 13 surgeries annu-ally.
“People have been kind; the donation 
rate has been good,” he said. “The average wait time for someone who is waiting for a kidney-pancreas combined transplant is shorter than the average in the country.”
Pancreas transplant surgery is a treat-ment option for Type 1 diabetes, Andreoni said.
“It’s important to offer transplants to 
people who will not only see an increase in quality of life but an increase in life length in general,” Andreoni said.
Aaron Froug, a 19-year-old food science 
and human nutrition freshman with Type 1 diabetes, said he’d rather Shands use the transplant program money to find a new insulin source for patients.
“Research and testing, I feel, would be 
an overall better solution,” he said. “Find out how to stop it before it becomes a prob-lem.”

You’re in charge of 
picking our president 
Have you been sad for the last 12 years and couldn’t put 
your ﬁ  nger on it?
It’s probably because that’s when the last episode of 
“Boy Meets World” aired.
Remember sobbing at that series ﬁ  nale? Mr. Feeny told those 
three best friends some pretty great advice: “Believe in your-selves. Dream. Try. Do good.”
That show pretty much helped raise a generation of Ameri-
cans. It taught us really hard lessons as well as really fun ones — like the time Cory and Shawn had to hug, or when Eric dressed up as a couch.
Well, here’s some good news, millennials: “Boy Meets World” 
might be coming back to TVs everywhere.
Disney is currently in talks to bring around a sequel to our be-
loved sitcom; it would focus on Cory and Topanga’s daughter.
Needless to say , we’re very ready for “Girl Meets World.” There’s still no word on whether the original cast will play a 
role in the new series, but we’d imagine that Cory and Topanga would have to be involved, at least. This TV series puts a whole lot of things into perspective. Things feel a lot less desolate now.
“Boy Meets World” was around during a more wholesome 
time in our lives. It was a show we could all watch with our families. These days, who knows if an awkward sex scene is go-ing to pop up and makes us want to change the channel.
It’s not like anyone under 16 years old should be watching 
any of the “Real Housewives” shows anyway.
You could almost say that there’s a bit of hope and change in 
the air. America needs this. Do you know what happened after “Boy Meets World” was canceled? George W. Bush was elected to ofﬁ  ce. That was not the best way to spend eight years after our favorite show disappeared from our lives.
Imagine “Modern Family” is about to be canceled (or what-
ever your favorite TV show is. What are the kids watching these days?). Who would you rather be your president as you spend the next four years mourning that show?
It’s halftime, America, and we’ve got some decisions to make. 
Should you take that early class for your major or that one elec-tive about alcohol? Should you apply for one internship that you really want or absolutely all of them? Should you pick the presi-dential candidate that is awesome/not a robot or the one who once described lemonade as “Lemon. Wet. Good.”?
Make the smart choices that will beneﬁ  t you the most. What we’re really saying is that you should probably vote for 
Barack Obama. 
Surprise! This was an endorsement article all along! At the 
end of the day , it doesn’t matter who we’d prefer you to vote for. It matters that you vote for who you want; if that means not voting, then ﬁ  ne, but the election cycle is almost over, folks.
We can at least agree with each other that we’re glad to see 
the political ads fade away.
Tomorrow is Election Day , in case you hadn’t heard. Keep “Boy Meets World” in your thoughts as you stand in 
line to vote tomorrow.The ballad of the rabid sports fan 
Last Saturday night I sent a text to my brother that 
read, “My heart is beyond broken.”
The Gators losing had a lot to do with this.
Another contributor was Florida State University’s 
victory over whatever high school they were playing. 
But the main catalyst of the breakage was a stunning 
trade that sent my favorite NBA player, James Harden, to the Houston Rockets.
It’s not that I’m a huge Oklahoma City Thunder 
fan: I do like Kevin Durant and the crew enough that I wanted them to win the title last year (especially after my beloved Jazz were unceremoniously swept away in the ﬁ  rst round) because Russell Westbrook looks like an alien from planet Speedfreak when he gets going on a fast break, and nobody has a beard like Harden.
Mostly it was how immensely fun they were to watch 
when they played together: OKC had such a perfect marriage of youth, chemistry, talent and athleticism.
Who knows, maybe they’ll be even more fun to 
watch this year with Kevin Martin knocking down dag-gers and Perry Jones doing Perry Jones things (good and bad).
But now they’re missing the Beard. And it hurts just a little bit.I know nothing gold can stay.Every time I ﬁ  nd something gold, I hope just a little 
bit in the back of my mind this time it’s different, that this time the gold will be around forever and the gold will start playing James Harden at the 3 with Durant at the 4 and Ibaka at the 5. 
Alas.I’m not gonna bore you with the pipe dream sce-
nario I’ve discussed with my brother three times now wherein Asik is a game-changing low-post defender and Lin is a faster, trickier Nash and Harden is like Jordan with Manu’s moves and Chandler Parsons and Royce White and Terrence Jones ball out enough that the Rockets shock the Lakers and we have a Thunder-Rockets Western Con-ference Finals. 
(Really, can’t we have this 
one cool thing just this one time, sports gods? 
Do we really need another 
Western Conference Finals with Kobe, Nash and Pau?)
Because my dilemma this week is much bigger than 
that one trade that depressed me when I was watching SportsCenter on some random Saturday night.
Why do I care so much? It’s SPORTS.Without even knowing it, some people like me be-
come converted to the gospel of sports, baptized in the rain of a muddy 26-19 prep football thriller, paying our tithes of ticket prices, $10 hot dogs and heartache over losses, proselyted by the doctrine of backdoor cuts and corner 3s.
There are a lot of people who are willing to argue 
and discourse for hours about religion, sometimes even shouting at you until they’re blue in the face that Jesus is God or Buddha is God or God is God or whatever.
Cheering for sports teams is just another way we 
while away our time down here on Earth, and it’s hon-estly one of the more stupid ones.

Many people speak of the moments that will 
impact the rest of your life. 
After these said moments happen, the way 
you think, the way you react and the way you see other 
people will all change. 
But the most incredible part is that after many years 
of life and thousands of moments every single day, this one moment will completely transform the way you are.  
I was skeptical of this assertion; I never truly 
thought a few short minutes could alter the way I 
saw the world. 
But like many times in life, I was incorrect.After classes on Friday, I like to spend my eve-
nings volunteering at a hospital. 
I mainly just clean up after meals and enjoy con-
versations.
The families I meet are hurting and are there to 
support a loved one who is not doing so well. 
We watch “Jeopardy” or talk about the Gators.Most of the time, for them it is just nice to talk 
about something other than what is always on their mind.
One night, a family came to sit in the kitchen area. 
They must have gotten something to go from a good restaurant because it smelled wonderful. 
I was starving because, silly me, I covered a shift 
for someone and forgot to eat dinner before.
Of course, my stomach kept 
making noises. 
I felt terrible because I truly 
did not want their food.
But as quickly as I tried to reassure the man I 
wasn’t hungry, he was already portioning the rest of his entrée on a plate for me. 
I was shocked and embarrassed. He was going to think I was doing it on purpose.But like a good person, he thought nothing of it 
and stated he was going to throw it away anyway.
I thanked him and appreciated him doing that, 
but I did not truly grasp how incredible of a gesture it was until later that evening.
About an hour or two later, I was informed the 
man’s family member was not going to make it and that he found out earlier that day. 
The family member had been battling an illness 
for months now, and it was time to say goodbye.
And there it was.It was that moment.You are probably thinking it doesn’t seem like 
much, but to me, it was so great. 
This man has been through hell and back — every 
morning hoping for the best, only to be disappointed. It was heartbreaking for him to see his loved one pass away and not be able to do something. 
It’s easy and understandable in that situation to be 
angry at the world. 
Instead, he chose to share his meal with me.I am sharing this story with you today because I 
believe we have become too wrapped up in the nega-tive part of society.
We don’t recognize all the good in people. People 
still hold the door for one another, offer to sit with someone sitting alone and alert a stranger after they dropped something.
There is bad in life, but there is so much good. Re-
member that the next time you are walking around on campus because, in my opinion, you are all good people.

Speaking OutThe Internet can be a scary place. 
It gives users the ability to connect effortlessly 
and anonymously to one another across vast physi-
cal distances. 
As Thomas Friedman said, the world is flat.
While the benefits of bringing together diverse and 
far-flung people of widely varying interests are obvi-ous, there are some very real and tangible downsides to allowing users unfettered access to one another, wrapped in the warm, snug blanket of anonymity the Internet can provide.
Reddit.com is arguably a microcosm of the Internet.According to the website, Reddit had more than 46 
million unique visitors to its content-aggregating site in October. 
There is much good that comes from gathering people 
together in such enormous numbers — Reddit’s Secret Santa program, for instance, is the largest in the world, with more than 37,000 participants last year — but it is inevitable and a fact of the human condition that such an enormous and anonymous conglomeration of people will magnify humanity’s worst impulses, too.
Three weeks ago, nobody on the national stage knew 
who Michael Brutsch was. 
He was a polite, nondescript application developer 
for First Cash Financial Services in Arlington. He went about his job quietly, and no one complained of any im-proprieties or misbehavior. He was just another quiet face in the crowd, doing his job, chatting idly with co-workers and going home to his family at night.
Brutsch’s Reddit alter ego, Violentacrez, was a differ -
ent matter altogether. 
Posting anonymously, Brutsch drew the attention of 
Anderson Cooper, who devoted a portion of his CNN show, “Anderson Cooper 360,” to condemning one of Brutsch’s creations — a forum on Reddit, commonly re-ferred to as a subreddit, called “r/jailbait,” that acted as a repository for suggestive photographs of underage girls.
As Violentacrez, Brutsch was an incredibly influen-
tial and prolific user and moderator. He was also re-sponsible for the subreddit “r/beatingwomen,” which is unfortunately exactly what it sounds like.
For Brutsch, it all started to unravel as the result of 
“r/creepshots,” which promoted and displayed com-promising photographs of young girls taken without their knowledge or consent.
One notable contributor was a Georgia substitute 
teacher who was identified and subsequently fired after students in the suggestive photos he contributed were recognized and the photos were traced back to him.
Given the amount of attention being paid nation-
ally to the Violentacrez subreddits and their content, it was only a matter of time before Brutsch’s identity became known, though this was apparently lost on him, and he continued to act 
as though his anonymity was inviolable and absolute.
The bitter end came when Gawker.com writer Adrien 
Chen identified Brutsch in October. 
Brutsch was fired from his job once his extracurricu-
lar activities became known, leaving him and his fam-ily with no health insurance. His wife is disabled and hasn’t been able to work in more than a year.
This outing sparked an enormous amount of debate 
and rhetoric about the right to privacy and anonymity on the Internet.
While Brutsch is nominally apologetic about his on-
line activities, he also maintains that his privacy was violated and that Chen wronged him.
Brutsch is by no means on the fringe here. There has been an overwhelming wave of free-
speech-themed defense of Brutsch’s anonymity, and there is no shortage of people outraged about the per -
ceived violation of a sacred right.
But the world is flat, and that goes both ways.With the amazing and world-altering speed and ef-
fectiveness of the Internet in connecting its users also comes the easy identification of a contributor. 
Chen didn’t do anything difficult, brave or laudable. 
He did a little research, took the story and ran with it. He’s not Woodward and Bernstein by any stretch.
Everyone comes out of this story looking worse for 
it. 
Brutsch is a sad, unsympathetic character who en-
couraged and promoted some of the most reprehensible content anywhere on the Internet, and Chen is a sensa-tionalist, yellow journalist who was hardly out for the greater good so much as web hits — precisely the same motivating factor for Brutsch as Violentacrez.
There is no real catharsis.There are bad people everywhere, and they will use 
all the wondrous and powerful tools decent people use with all the same effectiveness and power.
Outing Brutsch may have curbed his activities, but it 
isn’t a solution.
There really isn’t a solution. Humanity’s darker na-
ture is not going away.
The only honorable response is to monitor content 
they consume and tacitly support or aggressively dis-approve of content that violates the rights of others, acknowledging that the good fight will never be defini-tively won but continuing to fight it nonetheless.

UWireWhen Dean Cheshire was a stu-
dent senator at UF, he never thought 
he would run for political office.
He still didn’t think he would run 
after he earned his master’s of busi-ness administration and launched an educational software company.Cheshire decided he wanted to 
run for the District 5 seat on the Ala-chua County Commission to bring different opinions to the dais.
After he moved back to his home-
town, the Gainesville native was still wary of joining politics until he be-gan to attend city and county com-mission meetings.
“It was an organic moment when 
I realized how broken the county was,” said Cheshire, 30.
Cheshire said if he were elected, 
he would be able to bring a student’s perspective to the County Commis-sion. One of his priorities is creating more jobs for recent graduates.
“Our community has made it 
very expensive and time consuming to start a business,” he said.
Cheshire said one of the biggest 
inconveniences businesses face in the county is the massive amount of paperwork known as the Com-prehensive Plan. He said it includes fees, permits and county ordinances that make it difficult for businesses to establish themselves. 
He said if elected on Tuesday , 
he’ll work to streamline the process to open a business in the county . 
Cheshire is firmly opposed to 
some city and county commission-ers’ plan to change the Regional Transit System, saying it wouldn’t help students. He said he’d rather bolster the existing bus system for students instead of implement a sys-tem he doesn’t think will work.

ligator.org.Charles “Chuck” Chestnut was born and raised in Alachua 
County and doesn’t plan on leaving.
The owner of Chestnut Funeral Home said he’s made his voice 
heard as a Gainesville city commissioner and as a state represen-
tative. Chestnut, 50, is running for the Alachua County Commis-sion, saying his experience at both the local and state levels make him an ideal candidate.
“Job creation, a responsible budget, protecting our environ-
ment and standing up for our most vulnerable citizens are my priorities,” Chestnut stated on his website.
He said he tried to champion these causes in the state legisla-
ture but said he found a Republican-controlled House unwilling to reach across the aisle.
He voted against every state budget from 2008 until he left of-
fice earlier this year. Chestnut said he couldn’t support a budget that slashed funding for education and programs for the needy.
He said he would also like to streamline the county’s permit-
ting process for small businesses and compare its business fees to the rest of the state to come up with a more accurate standard.
Chestnut would make extra efforts to keep businesses associ-
ated with Innovation Gainesville in Alachua County by offering them reduced fees and other incentives.
Another way he said he plans to spur job creation is by pre-
serving natural attractions to stimulate ecotourism jobs.
“It is simply not true that we have choose between the envi-
ronment and the economy,” Chestnut wrote in a blog.
He said as a state representative, he saw that state lawmakers 
were trying to cut funding for environmental preservation pro-grams, which is why the county must work to save environmen-tally based programs like Alachua County Forever.
But Chestnut said none of these goals are attainable until the 
county gets its finances in order. He hopes to achieve this by elim-inating redundancies in the county’s budget, making plain-lan-guage summaries of initiatives and cutting auxiliary spending.
“As money from Tallahassee and Washington, D.C., becomes 
more scarce, we must build a more efficient, more effective gov-ernment,” Chestnut wrote.

Editor’s note: This is part of a 
series that profiles candidates run-ning for local offices.
K. Siva Prasad is used to being at 
a disadvantage.
When he moved from India, he 
said, employers would only hire him 
for entry-level positions, in spite of his years of engineering experience.
Now, Prasad, 76, said he hopes to 
overcome the odds by running as a nonparty affiliated candidate for the District 5 seat in the Alachua County Commission.
He said because he isn’t backed 
by interest groups, he’ll be able to fo-cus his attention on his constituents, mainly the 80 percent of county resi-dents he said make $100,000 or less.
“Republicans and Democrats 
have both rendered the government immobile and ineffective,” Prasad said. “They have taken advantage of people’s misery.”
He said he hopes to help stabi-
lize household economics through community programs. In particular, Prasad wants to provide resources for the 24 percent of Alachua County residents he said live at or below the $50,000 poverty line.
He would make the first expen-
ditures the commission makes go to “help the needy and sick” — an idea that encompasses a broad umbrella of programs like affordable housing options and food pantries. 
Prasad promised to work for two 
years at one half the commission’s pay , which is $70,444 according to the county . Prasad also pledged to resign his position if 30 percent of Alachua County residents sign a pti-tion asking him to leave.

Young adults trust President 
Barack Obama more than Re-
publican candidate Mitt Romney , but Romney supporters are more likely to vote Tuesday , according to a recent survey.
The Harvard Institute of Poli-
tics survey of more than 2,000 18- to 29-year-olds also found that less than half of young adults are expected to vote in this year’s election.
Beth Rosenson, associate 
professor of political science at UF, said she was surprised by the results. She said the age gap between the candidates might lead to students trusting Obama more.
“From a student’s perspec-
tive, Obama may be more like your father, and Romney’s like your grandfather,” she said.
Anel Henry , an 18-year-old 
biology freshman, said he doesn’t think Obama’s age has anything to do with his popularity among young voters.
“He has specifics and says 
his plan,” he said. “Romney doesn’t.”Rosenson said minorities gen-
erally vote at lower rates than nonminorities, which might be why the study shows Romney supporters are more likely to visit voting booths. In addition, many students are from out of town, a factor which often discourages them from registering to vote.
Nate Poling, a 31-year-old 
educational technology doc-
toral student, said he thinks Obama had a bigger influ-
ence on young voters in the 2008 election than for this year’s elec-tion.
Still, he said young adults 
might find Obama more trust-worthy because he seems per -
sonable in public appearances.
“In my opinion, Romney 
comes across as a typical politi-cian,” he said.
Poling said he isn’t surprised 
a low number of young adults are expected to vote.
“It’s politics,” he said. “When 
I was young, politics was for old-er people.”Youth more likely to 
trust Obama, study sayscrime

With the Florida Gators’ win 
against the Missouri Tigers on Sat-
urday , football fans on both sides behaved better than usual.
University Police ejected 18 
people — eight of whom were UF students — during Saturday’s matchup at Ben Hill Griffin Sta-dium, according to a UPD news release.
Police kicked out and issued 
civil citations to six people for alco-hol possession.
UPD officers booted six addi-
tional people for standing on seats, two others for smoking and the rest for either switching tickets, public intoxication, disorderly conduct or using a fake student ID.
University Police did not make 
any arrests during the game, giv-ing fans a clean arrest record for the second time this season.
The last time police left the 
stadium without any arrests was during the UF vs. University of Kentucky football game Sept. 22. During that game, officers ejected 32 people, nine of whom were UF students, according to an archived UPD news release.
The season opener against 
Bowling Green State University Sept. 1 was another low-arrest game, which led to officers putting two people — both UF students — in handcuffs.
The next home game will be 
against the University of Louisiana at Lafayette on Saturday.

Students on UF’s campus Saturday evening were 
at risk of guerrilla tactics: pop musician Sara Bareilles 
hanging out of a van window, shouting excitedly at them to vote.
The three-time Grammy Award nominee and 
“Love Song” singer visited Gainesville to mobilize vot-ers and volunteers for President Barack Obama. She spoke to more than 100 students at the Reitz Union, posed for pictures and jumped in a Gators for Obama van taking voters downtown to the Alachua County Supervisor of Elections Office.
“It sounds really cliche, but you are the future, and 
so we depend on you guys to be super smart and su-per educated and really involved,” Bareilles said.René Ciarmataro, an 18-year-old UF exploratory 
engineering freshman, said she thought Bareilles’ ap-pearance motivated attendees to vote.
“There seems to be a lot of passion on the campus 
and a lot of mobilization from the students,” Bareilles said.
In the van, she alternated be-
tween yelling at pedestrians and chatting with passengers from her 
spot in the shotgun seat.
“Just hearing that she supports 
Obama as well made me happier,” said Michael Johns, a 19-year-old UF linguistics sophomore.
“As energetic as the youth community is, we tend 
to err on apathy,” she said, “and it’s important, I think, to do whatever you can to use your voice to encourage people just to participate.”

Freshmen Jonathan Bullard (90) and Dante Fowler Jr.  (6) celebrate a stop of Missouri 
tailback Kendial Lawrence (4) during UF’s 14-7 win on Saturday in The Swamp. 
 �JONATHAN BULLARD AND DANTE 
FOWLER JR. COMBINED FOR 2.5 SACKS IN SATURDAY’S VICTORY. 
  ADAM PINCUS
 Alligator Staff Writer
 
  Jonathan Bullard had more than Missouri 
on his mind.
  The freshman defensive end visited his ail-
ing grandmother in Shelby, N.C., during the 
week, but still managed to pick up three tack-les and a team-leading 1.5 sacks on Saturday against Missouri.
  He earned the ﬁ  rst sack of his career when 
he dropped Missouri quarterback James Frank-lin for a loss of 8 yards in the second quarter.
  Bullard returned to Gainesville on Friday 
night, according to a post on his Twitter ac-count.
  “The D-line all sat down with Bullard and 
we let him know that we are there for him,” defensive tackle Sharrif Floyd said. “We ral-lied around him. We gave our thanks to him for coming back knowing his situation back home. Whatever he needed, he knew we were there.”
  Bullard returned the favor.  He and freshman Buck linebacker Dante 
Fowler Jr. have provided the Gators with two effective pass rushers off the bench.
  On Saturday, Fowler started for Lerentee 
McCray, who didn’t dress due to an ankle in-jury . Fowler racked up ﬁ  ve tackles, one sack and two tackles for loss.
  The two headline a group of defensive line reserves that gives defensive coordinator Dan Quinn more ﬂ  exibility.
  More depth along the defensive line has 
resulted in the Gators being fresher late in games.
  Florida has outscored opponents 68-20 in 
the fourth quarter this season and has allowed two touchdowns in the last 15 minutes of con-ference games.
  Last year, SEC teams outscored the Gators 
72-22 in the fourth quarter.
  Florida held Missouri scoreless after half-
time.
  “Dan was able to, in dead-ball situations, 
sub an entire defensive front and put four fresh rushers into the game,” coach Will Muschamp said. “That was the difference in the game, us being able to rush four and be effective with four guys rushing, because that’s the best pass defense in America.”
  Missouri quarterback James Franklin 
missed several open receivers and couldn’t get comfortable in the pocket, throwing a season-high four interceptions.
  Down by seven in the fourth quarter, Frank-
lin drove the football to Florida’s 24-yard line.
  An incomplete pass, a sack by Jelani Jen-
kins and an intentional grounding penalty left the Tigers with a third-and-21 situation.
  Bullard combined with defensive end Do-
minique Easley to sack Franklin for a loss of 9 yards, knocking the Tigers out of ﬁ  eld goal range.
  “Jonathan’s a young man that’s going to be 
a heck of a football player,” Muschamp said. “(He’s) just getting started, folks. He made a  Freshmen defensive ends bolstering Gators pass rush
FIRE JOE MORGAN
  Forget a one-dimensional of-
fense. Florida is a one-dimen-sional football team.
  The UF defense, which ranks 
ﬁ  fth in the nation, is the reason the Gators are winning, and the offense — ranked 103rd — remains this team’s biggest, most glaring weak-ness.
  Many onlookers praise offen-
sive coordinator Brent Pease while slamming Charlie Weis, but Florida has only managed an additional 4.1 yards per game this season despite an improved running game and a better defense that gets off the ﬁ  eld quicker.
  Florida’s two strengths — ball se-
curity and the running game — have dissipated, yet the Gators remain a stubborn bunch.
  UF will not shake things up of-
fensively. But if I took the reins with nothing to lose, here are some things I would try:
  1. Let Pease do whatever he wants — Although coach Will Mus-champ has said he and Pease share a similar offensive philosophy, I don’t think Florida’s current attack is ex-actly what Pease had in mind when he arrived in Gainesville. Jeff Driskel is no Kellen Moore, but Muschamp should take the leash off Pease for a day and see what happens.  The Gators have two weeks to try all sorts of crazy stuff against a couple of scrubs in Louisiana and Jackson-ville State.
  2. Change out wide receivers —
Put Loucheiz Purifoy and Omarius Hines at wideout. Could either guy be as inconsistent as the receivers UF is putting on the ﬁ  eld now? There is no way Frankie Hammond Jr. is the best wideout on Florida’s roster. Purifoy had one of the best catches made by a Gator this season on a punt during Saturday’s game. Hines is the most underutilized player on Florida’s roster. Both have good size, and they have been clutch when called upon this season. It’s time to expand each guy’s role.
  3. Re-
open the quarter-
back competition — There’s no denying that Driskel has been a playmaker for the Gators with his feet this season. But Driskel’s incon-sistency in the passing game limits what Florida can do through the air.
  Meanwhile, Jacoby Brissett nev-
er got a fair shake once the season began, especially after outplaying Driskel in 2011. Driskel scrambles better, but Brissett’s mobility is not a signiﬁ  cant liability . It’s a win-win situation. You either light a ﬁ  re un-der Driskel, or you upgrade under center with Brissett. 
4. Switch to Georgia Tech’s of-
UF needs bold changes on offense

  Florida moved up one spot 
to No. 6 in the BCS rankings 
on Sunday, as LSU dropped from No. 5 to No. 7 after a 21-17 loss to No. 1 Alabama. 
  The Gators are the second 
highest-ranked one-loss team. Georgia is No. 5. 
  Four of the ﬁ  ve remain-
ing undefeated teams — Ala-bama, Kansas State, Oregon and Notre Dame — are the top four in the BCS. Unde-feated Lousiville is ranked No. 9.

Omarius Hines runs by two Missouri defenders en route to a 36-
yard touchdown in UF’s 14-7 win on Saturday in The Swamp.
fense — The Gators might as well switch to 
the ﬂ  exbone formation triple option. Before Saturday , they ran the ball on 78.1 percent of ﬁ  rst-down plays. That ﬁ  gure is even higher than that of the Yellow Jackets, who ran the ball on 77.9 percent of ﬁ  rst downs before Sat-urday. Florida’s receivers are adequate block-ers in the open ﬁ  eld. Fullback Hunter Joyer is a talented football player who would thrive in an increased role. Driskel and Gillislee would shine. Changing an offense midseason is im-possible. But hypothetically, the Gators’ per-sonnel would ﬂ  ourish in a scheme similar to the one Paul Johnson runs at Georgia Tech. Just look at Florida’s win against LSU. The Gators bossed around one of the most physi-cal teams in the nation. Why not embrace that style completely?
  Am I a problem solver? No. Am I ﬁ  t to 
coach any football team on any level? No.
  But the Gators’ offense is in shambles, 
and if I were in Muschamp’s shoes, I would be willing to try pretty much anything at this point. Why not?

  Bullard and Fowler impressed 
linebacker Jon Bostic with their abil-
ity to grasp Florida’s complex de-fense.
  Defensive tackle Omar Hunter 
raved about Bullard and Fowler’s effort, and Floyd revealed his advice for the two freshmen.
  “Can’t nobody block you,” Floyd said. 
“That’s the way it should be in 
their head. Can’t nobody block you. That’s it. I’m going to out-physical you, because at some point during that 60 minutes, your body is going to give out before mine does.”  As they have the entire season, 
the two freshmen helped the Gators rush the passer.
  For Bullard, there was a great-
er purpose against Missouri. He shared his thoughts after defeating the Tigers from his Twitter account, @JBullard90:
  “I played a pretty good game ! It 
was for you MawMaw ! #ILOVEY-OU”

Saturday’s 14-7 win against 
Missouri was one of Florida’s most physically taxing this season.
  “Everybody is ﬁ  ghting 
through stuff,” linebacker Jon Bostic said.
  Florida won Saturday’s 
game without key pieces of its pass rush and pass protec-tion, as Buck linebacker Ler-entee McCray (ankle) and left tackle Xavier Nixon (knee) both did not dress.
  “[They] were game-time 
decisions,” coach Will Mus-champ said. “I didn’t feel that they could go.”
  Freshmen Dante Fowler Jr. 
and Jonathan Bullard provid-ed a pass rush in McCray’s absence, while freshman D.J. Humphries ﬁ  lled in for Nix-on.
  “No matter what, we feel 
like we can always pull close,” right tackle Chaz Green said. “Man down, man up. No mat-ter who is in there, we have the utmost faith that they’re going to pull through.”
  Andre Debose did not dress for the game after suf-fering a knee injury during practice on Thursday.
  Kicker Caleb Sturgis suf-
fered an injury that led to swelling in the ankle on his kicking foot during the week of practice. Sturgis attempted a 47-yard ﬁ  eld goal during the second quarter but could not generate the proper el-evation, leading to a blocked kick.
  Safety Matt Elam also left 
Saturday’s game due to in-jury.
  “He just strained his 
groin,” Muschamp said. “He’s going to be ﬁ  ne.”
  “With Matt being back 
there, that’s a big help,” Bos-tic said. “Him, me; there’s a lot of guys on defense that are ﬁ  ghting through things today. Hopefully he’s healthy for next week.”
  Guards Jon Halapio and 
James Wilson also suffered undisclosed injuries on Sat-urday, as did running back Mack Brown.  Muschamp did not know the extent of the in-juries.

Elam takes top 
honors after recording six tackles, two tackles for a 
loss, a pass breakup and a game-changing interception. Elam’s third-quarter pick set up Florida’s game-winning touchdown drive.
On the penultimate play of the third quarter, Missouri quarterback James Franklin overthrew a 
pass that landed in the arms of Matt Elam, who returned the ball 42 yards to Florida’s 46-yard line. Just 110 seconds later, the Gators notched the game-winning score.4
The Gators intercepted Tigers quarterback 
James Franklin four times, including Missouri’s 
ﬁ  nal two drives of the game. The four picks 
netted Florida a plus-three advantage in 
turnover margin and kept Missouri’s offense 
from getting on a roll.KEY STAT

Trailing by seven in the game’s ﬁ  nal 
minute, the Tigers had the ball on the Gators’ 21-yard line. But UF safety Josh Evans intercepted another over-thrown pass from quarterback James Franklin to seal the victory for Florida.
Two plays after a 43-yard touch-
down pass from Jeff Driskel to Frankie Hammond Jr. was called back due to a holding penalty, Driskel found Mike Gillislee on a screen pass. Gillislee did the rest, 
scoring a 45-yard touchdown to put Florida ahead for good in the fourth quarter.After a scoreless first half devoid of offensive rhythm, Trey Burton and Omarius Hines came out in the wildcat formation. Burton took the snap and handed off to Hines, who ran 36 yards to the end zone 
for the game-tying touchdown.Gators defense forces four turnovers, embraces ‘fireman’ role
this year after the Tigers took a 
7-0 lead into the break. Omarius Hines said Florida has mastered the art of having a short memory.
“Just can’t let people get their 
head down,” Hines said. “It’s a 60-minute game. That was 30 minutes of it. Halftime, when we go back out there, it’s 0-0. That’s the kind of mentality we have.”
Hines tied the game with a 
36-yard touchdown run on a jet sweep handoff from Trey Bur -
ton early in the second half. Until that point, the Gators defense had kept UF in the game, just as it has numerous times this season.
Missouri’s first four posses-
sions ended with three punts and a Jaylen Watkins interception. 
“In all my years as a defensive 
coordinator, regardless of the cir -
cumstances, our job is to make stops,” Muschamp said when asked about the defense carry-ing the team. “I always tell them ‘You’re the fireman. Go put the fire out. I don’t care how bad it’s blazing. Go put it out.’”
Florida, which entered Sat-
urday ranked 10th in the SEC in sacks with 16, tied a season-high with four against Franklin thanks to an improved four-man pass rush. 
Freshmen Dante Fowler Jr. and 
Jonathan Bullard each had stand-out performances. 
Fowler recorded two tackles 
for a loss and a sack while Bullard had 1.5 sacks. Defensive tackle Sharrif Floyd made three tackles for a loss to push his team lead in the category to 10 — four more than any other Gator.
Floyd said that as the game 
wore on, Florida’s defenders grew more confident.
“[UF’s defense is] just relent-
less,” Floyd said. “Any time something good or bad happens before the defense goes on the field, coach says, ‘Go get them.’ And we went and got them.”
Whenever the Tigers had suc-
cess moving the ball, the Gators responded. 
Safety Matt Elam picked off 
Franklin on the UF 4-yard line with the game tied in the third quarter. On the ensuing posses-sion, Florida took the lead on a 45-yard touchdown reception by Mike Gillislee on a screen pass.
Missouri covered 59 yards 
in less than two minutes before Franklin threw his fourth inter -
ception of the game to end the Tigers’ final drive. Josh Evans picked off the pass in the end zone to secure the seven-point victory. 
The Gators do not have to win 
pretty to end their season on a big stage. With a No. 6 BCS ranking, UF simply needs to win out to have a chance at receiving an at-large bid to the Sugar Bowl. 
If that requires the defense to 
put the team on its back, defen-sive tackle Omar Hunter will be happy to shoulder the load.
“We love it when our back’s 
against the wall and everything is put on us,” Hunter said. “We wouldn’t have it any other way.”

FOOTBALL , from page 1 �UF EARNED ITS 10TH SEC 
TOURNEY TITLE ON SUNDAY. 
ADAM LICHTENSTEIN
Alligator Writer
In last season’s Southeastern 
Conference Tournament final, Au-
burn dashed Florida’s  hopes with a 3-2 upset of the fourth-seeded Gators. 
The tables were turned this 
year as top-seeded Florida (17-4-1, 11-2 SEC) cruised to a 3-0 victory against Auburn (12-10-1, 7-6 SEC) to clinch the program’s 10th SEC Tournament title.
“It was definitely some good re-
demption for us,” sophomore mid-fielder Havana Solaun said. “After last year, losing in the finals, we kind of wanted to come back. … Winning the tournament was a goal, and I think that having a re-match against them was just extra icing on the cake.”
The decisive goal came early 
in the match when junior Adriana Leon sent in a low shot that snuck past Tigers goalkeeper Amy How-ard. 
The goal was Leon’s second 
game-winner against Auburn this season. She scored a golden goal in the 100th minute of the Gators’ 2-1 win on Sept. 16.  
Just four minutes later, Florida 
added a second score. Senior mid-fielder Erika Tymrak received a pass from Solaun, who had sprint-ed past two Auburn defenders, and fired a shot to the near post from 20 yards out. The goal was Tymrak’s eighth of the season and third in the tournament.Tymrak nearly added a second 
goal in the 58th minute, when she took a shot that bounced off a Ti-gers player. The ball ricocheted past Howard and rolled toward the line. At the last moment, an Auburn defender kicked it out to save the goal.
“Of course I thought it went in, 
but the referee didn’t,” Tymrak said.
Tymrak and Solaun combined 
again to produce the game’s final goal in the 70th minute. Tymrak had the ball at the top 
of the box when Solaun ran around the edge of the defenders. Tymrak dribbled back and sent a pass to Solaun, who drilled in a shot from the corner.
“That was pretty sweet,” coach 
Becky Burleigh said. “That’s stuff we work on all the time. It’s so nice to see it come to fruition in a game.”
Tymrak was named the SEC 
Tournament MVP . In three games, she scored three goals and regis-tered three assists.
“It feels awesome,” Tymrak 
said.
Auburn midfielder Ana Cate 
scored the game-winning goal in the 2011 matchup, but she received recognition for another reason on Sunday.
Cate recorded several fouls in 
the game, but the most significant came in 53rd minute, when she and senior Jo Dragotta jumped for a bouncing ball. Cate elbowed Dragotta in the head, and Dragotta fell to the ground. She did not get up for several minutes. Dragotta left the field wearing a neck brace and did not return to the game.
Burleigh said Dragotta would 
be evaluated after being pulled for precautionary reasons.
“Any time you get hit in the 
head, it’s something to be a little bit concerned about,” Burleigh said.16, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, NOVEMBER 5, 2012
