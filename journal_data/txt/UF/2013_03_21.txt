UF student voter turnout on campus 
saw a slight increase during Tuesday’s 
Gainesville city elections as compared 
with previous years.
On Tuesday, 363 voters, or about 6 
percent of the 5,645 Alachua County 
registered voters who live on campus, 
cast ballots at the Reitz Union precinct, 
according to the Alachua County Supervisor of Elections website.
In 2010, student turnout was about 2 
percent. 
In 2007, about 1 percent of students 
went to the polls.
Of the 363 votes cast at the Reitz 
Union, 87 left the choice for mayor blank, according to the Supervisor of Elections website.
Supervisor of Elections Pam Carpenter 
said the number who didn’t vote for mayor could suggest some students focused on voting in the District 4 City Commission 
race, which pitted incumbent Randy Wells, 
W.E. “Mac” McEachern and 20-year-old UF building construction junior Alfredo Espinosa for the seat.
The city as a whole received wider participation, with about 15 percent of registered voters going to the polls.
Carpenter said the turnout is normal 
for city elections.
However, some students remained 
disengaged in the process.
Samantha Webster, a 19-year-old UF 
music and engineering freshman, said she wasn’t interested in voting because she doesn’t feel as invested in Gainesville as she does in her hometown.
“I wouldn’t vote ... because I don’t 
consider this city my city,” she said.

Two majors might be 
better than one, but not all 
UF students are rushing to the advising ofﬁ  ce.
Students who choose to 
double major are more cre-ative and have better inte-grative thinking skills com-pared to their single-major counterparts, according to a recent study from Vander-bilt University.
Steven Tepper, co-author 
of the study and an associ-
ate professor of sociology at 
Vanderbilt University, said adding a double major can enhance a student’s mind.
“We did not ﬁ  nd that 
[the students] were more creative to begin with based on their own self ratings,” he said. “We found that the double major provides students an opportunity to make connections and broaden their minds in ways they might not have 
had otherwise.”
UF student Heather 
O’Rourke said she feels her 
dual major of marketing and advertising has helped her develop more dynamic 
thinking skills because she 
often brings information she learned in advertising to her marketing classes and vice versa.
“I talk about things that 
they have no idea about,” the 22-year-old senior said about her single-major classmates.Twice the degree

Fans of the GIF of Jennifer Lawrence tripping at the 
Oscars won’t have to comb through countless websites to 
ﬁ  nd it. Google has made it easier to search for them.
Google announced its new search ﬁ  lter, which was 
available for use Tuesday, that includes the option to search for animated Graphics Interchange Formats, ac-cording to a Google blog post.
“Having a robust search can help you ﬁ  nd things bet-ter, and certainly, this will help people,” said UF’s social media specialist Bruce Floyd.
GIFs have been around since 1987, according to the 
Google blog post.
Floyd said the popularity with them has recently risen 
because there are websites now where people can make their own animated GIFs.
The search ﬁ  lter is accessible when clicking “Search 
tools” below the image search box and then selecting “Animated” under the “Any type” drop-down menu.
Alexa Carlin, a 21-year-old UF business senior, said she is deﬁ  nitely going to use the search bar to her advantage.
Carlin is the founder and president of Hello Perfect, a 
student-run fashion blog. She said her website will beneﬁ  t from the new search tools because it will help the com-pany with search engine optimization for the new GIFs they recently created.
“So it’s really about innovating blogs and websites 
across the board,” Carlin said. “Because Google jumped on board and is innovating and pushing it forward, it’s just going to create a ripple effect with every single web-site.”What should we call them: Google makes GIFs easier to search forSEE MAJORS, PAGE 4“I wouldn’t vote ... because I

Deer bolts from car trunk
KALAMAZOO, Mich. — Talk about junk in the trunk.A public safety officer checking 
a suspicious car parked behind 
a southwestern Michigan motel early Tuesday was more than a little surprised when a deer 
climbed out of the trunk, stum-
bled onto the road and bolted into nearby woods.TV stations WWMT, WZZM and WOOD report that the 
driver told Kalamazoo officer 
David Miller he hit the deer on the road — thought he had killed it — and was taking it 
home for his family to eat.
Squad car dashboard camera footage shows Miller opening 
the trunk, then quickly trying 
to close it as he spots the deer. The animal escapes from the trunk, rear first, stumbles and rolls, then dashes off.

Eight students will eat, sleep and 
work in a downtown Gainesville 
mansion as part of a three-month mentoring program to promote technological innovation.
HackerHouse will give the stu-
dents a chance to create anything from software to robotics under one roof to pitch to investors.
“It’s going to be a life-changing 
event for these kids,” said Augi Lye, founder of HackerHouse. “They will live, breathe what it’s like to be Steve Jobs — or more like Steve 
Wozniak.”
The summer class starts May 6.
Lye said the students, also known 
as cadets, will be guided by mentors including professional hacker Chris-tian von Kleist and Student Maid founder Kristen Hadeed.
“I believe in having really strong friendships and relationships,” Ha-deed said. “That is how you suc-ceed.”
Students will be guided by dif-
ferent mentors throughout the pro-gram, and at the end, they will get to keep what they create.
“Cadets are exposed to different 
phases of not just prototyping but of starting a company,” Lye said.
The first two weeks of the pro-
gram will consist of students creat-ing ideas for their prototypes. After, they will finish their product and create a business plan to pitch. 
The winning prototype will re-
ceive $50,000 worth of professional services and financial prizes from local companies, Lye said.
He added that UF engineers who 
are accepted into the program will receive college credit. Students who are interested in applying to the pro-gram can email info@hackerhouse.info.HackerHouse students

UF student Laura Mutis came to the United 
States from Colombia 10 years ago. She was an 
English for Speakers of Other Languages stu-dent in high school and was unsure how she would get into college. ESOL helps students from other countries learn and comprehend English.
Mutis, a 21-year-old economics and po-
litical science senior and founder of the ESOL Achievers Mentoring Program, said she un-derstands the difficulties and barriers ESOL students face.
For the past three years, the ESOL Achiev-
ers Mentoring Program has worked with Gainesville High School, which is the only high school in Gainesville with an ESOL pro-gram, Mutis said.
On Wednesday, the ESOL Achievers Men-
toring Program hosted One Step Forward in the Reitz Union. At the event, 28 ESOL stu-dents received a tour and talked to one profes-sor from its college of interest. The colleges in-cluded engineering, business, journalism and liberal arts and sciences.
“We want to inspire them and show that 
they have support everywhere,” she said.
Louise Yariv, who teaches ESOL at 
Gainesville High School, said she hopes her 
students realized all they can do from this ex-
perience.

After an eight-hour search, 
Gainesville Police and GFR offi-
cials found a missing 81-year-old 
man Wednesday morning after 
he walked out of his house the previous night.
Officials found Eddie Wou-
lard, of 1312 NE 17th Ave., at about 7 a.m. Wednesday in the woods near the intersection of Northeast 23rd Avenue and Northeast Waldo Road, about a 
mile away from his home, said 
GPD spokesman Officer Ben To-bias.
The incident started when 
Woulard’s sister, Latrisha Wou-lard, reported Eddie Woulard missing at about 11 p.m. Tues-day, according to a GPD news release.
Because Woulard is elderly 
and suffers from dementia, he was considered an endangered missing person, which GPD of-ficers treat differently from other missing person reports, Tobias said.
Young children or those who 
are believed to be missing be-cause of criminal activity are also considered endangered, he said.
During the search for Eddie 
Woulard, Tobias said Gainesville Police notified local businesses and other police departments about the disappearance and 
posted information online to 
residents.
A Gainesville resident called 
Gainesville Fire Rescue at about 7 a.m. to report that someone, 
who was later identified as Ed-
die Woulard, was in the woods trying to light a fire for warmth.
When officials arrived at the 
woods, they found Eddie Wou-lard and later drove him to his house, Tobias said.

How did UF respond to Nike’s 
Fuel Your Team tournament? Stu-
dents said, “Just Do It.”
On Wednesday night, about 300 
students sprinted, jumped, lunged 
and leaped in an intense one-hour 
workout in the Stephen C. O’Connell Center led by Nike Training Club professional trainers.
UF was the first of three univer-
sities chosen for the special work-out, which is part of Nike’s “Inten-sity #COUNTS” initiative, said Jeron Smith, brand manager for Nike bas-
ketball.
“Intensity #COUNTS brings the 
spirit of competition to college fans 
at a time when the energy around the game is at its highest,” said Nike spokesman Brian Strong.
The initiative gives fans an op-
portunity to pledge NikeFuel points 
on behalf of their school and com-
pete with others. Users can track their activity through various Nike+ devices that calculate NikeFuel and upload it, Strong said.
“I’m here because it’s a chance 
to generate fuel points for our team and beat Oregon,” said 20-year-old UF applied physiology and kinesiol-ogy junior Goeto Dantes. “We love Nike, and we’re here to represent The Gator Nation.”
Kelly Hill said she thinks UF will 
do well in the competition.
“We’re a really active campus, 
and it would be really easy to make the fuel count for UF,” the 21-year-old UF animal biology junior said. 
The competition will continue 
until the end of the NCAA March Madness Tournament. Track UF’s

Spray paint, switchblades and Shakespeare.
That’s how Rylee Ennis, co-director of UF’s Shakespeare 
in the Park, describes the group’s adaptation of “Hamlet,” which will be performed through Sunday.
In UF’s punk-rock version, Hamlet’s relationship with 
his girlfriend, Ophelia, is based on the “toxic” relationship between punk-rock bassist Sid Vicious, of the Sex Pistols, and his girlfriend, Nancy Spungen.
The free show will be performed at 6 p.m. through Sat-urday and at 4 p.m. Sunday on the Plaza of the Americas. If it rains, the play will move under the covering in front of Library West.
UF Shakespeare in the Park President Leah Gidwani sug-
gested people bring blankets, snacks and friends to the per-formance.Gidwani, a 21-year-old UF marketing and international 
business senior, said about 620 people attended last Spring.
Patrick Runfeldt, a 21-year-old UF English junior, is the 
co-director for the show.
This adaptation of “Hamlet” has been his pet project for 
about a year.
“I think seeing it on stage is one of the best ways to see 
it,” he said. “The page doesn’t compare.”
Gidwani suggested people get to the performance early.“To be, or not to be? It’s not even a question,” she said.

A rash of mysterious manatee deaths in Brevard 
County and surrounding areas have baffled scientists.
More than 50 manatees have been found dead, 
showing signs of shock and drowning, said Kevin Bax-
ter, spokesman for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Con-
servation Commission. At least 25 of those deaths have 
occurred since early February.
The commission has done a number of tests on the 
affected manatees for known marine toxins, but the re-sults have come back negative, Baxter said. Currently, scientists are collecting and testing soil, water and mac-roalgae samples.
So far, scientists have reported that the only com-
mon link among the manatees is their change in di-
etary habits, Baxter said.
“What we’re seeing in common between this group 
of dead manatees is the ingestion of large amounts of 
macroalgae,” he said.
Katie Tripp, a UF alumna and director of science and conservation for the Save the Manatee Club, said the dietary change might have been related to the loss of sea grass in the area, which is a main food source. Without the sea grass, manatees have been forced to 
find less nutritious sources such as the macroalgae.
“It’s not known in the past that this was toxic to 
manatees,” Tripp said.
A particular problem scientists face is the lack of a 
live specimen suffering from the strange ailment. The 
only manatees found have already died, Tripp said.
“It’s really important for anyone out on the water-
ways to be looking out for odd behavior from mana-tees,” she said. “That’s our best chance of getting them help in time.”Manatee deaths confuse scientists

the waterways to be looking out for odd 
behavior from manatees.”

The study involved about 1,700 students
The five-year study, which in-
volved about 1,700 undergradu-
ate students with double majors at nine colleges and universities, divided students into two catego-
ries: hyper-specialization majors 
and hypo-specialization majors. The groups represented students with majors that are similar and students with majors that are dis-similar, respectively.
Tepper said hyper-specializa-
tion students have higher inte-grative thinking skills, while hy-po-specialization students tend to be more creative.
“If you’re taking two classes 
that are quite similar, it’s going to be easy to make those connec-tions,” he said.Tepper said students should 
refrain from just adding a major 
haphazardly.
Leon Franco, a 19-year-old 
UF accounting freshman, said he 
doesn’t think having a single ma-jor puts him at a disadvantage.
“It all depends on the person 
and how involved they are,” he said.

DELIVERING OXYGEN TO HURT AREAS. ALYSSA FISHER

About 60 animals have been treated at 
UF’s Small Animal Hospital with a hyper-
baric chamber, an oxygen machine found to 
cure the wounds of furry friends in addition 
to people.
This Fall, the animal hospital became the 
first teaching hospital to install a veterinary 
hyperbaric chamber for clinical research, said 
UF clinical assistant professor of integrative medicine Justin Shmalberg.
The chamber is a pressurized unit that 
keeps cells alive by delivering oxygen to in-
jured areas. Although it has been common 
in treating human patients, it has only been used for veterinary clinical patients within the last 10 years.
Shmalberg said there is not much research 
on the clinical conditions of pets.
He said the university accepted the do-
nated chamber from a Florida-based manu-facturing company because he believes more 
veterinarians are going to be using it in the future,
“So we need to start informing [them] 
about what sort of outcomes we’re having 
and do some clinical research on owned pa-tients as compared to lab animals that may 
have been used in the past,” Shmalberg said.
He said the chamber’s high-pressure at-
mosphere of pure oxygen aids severe swell-
ing. So far, there have been about 190 ses-sions, averaging about three sessions per 
animal. About 25 animals visit the hospital a 
year due to snake bites, a common injury the chamber has had success in relieving.
Jackie, a 1-year-old Siberian husky and 
standard poodle mix, was the first animal treated in UF’s hyperbaric chamber for a rattlesnake bite.
Her owner, Jan Smith, of Clermont, Fla., 
was advised to take Jackie to UF after anti-
venom treatment proved unsuccessful.
“They basically saved her life,” Smith said. 
“They used the hyperbaric chamber on her 
face because her head had swollen up from 
the bites... Now there are no scars or lasting 
repercussions – she’s just perfect.”
Shmalberg said he is confident in the 
hyperbaric chamber and is ready to learn more.
“I think we’ve seen very encouraging re-sults in certain types of patients,” he said. 
“We are definitely excited going forward to 
hopefully publish some information about what the hyperbaric chamber can do and 
maybe what its limitations or side effects 
might be as well.”THURSDAY, MARCH 21, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 5

many Americans may have little interest in the matter.
Twenty percent of Americans 
claimed no religious preference, according to a recently released survey, and UF associate professor David Hackett isn’t surprised.
“What people are doing, with regard to religious observances, is they’re participating less in go-ing together with other people in a congregational form of worship,” 
said Hackett, who works for UF’s 
department of religion.
The results were from the 2012 
General Social Survey, a poll of American adults. This is the lowest American religious affiliation has been since it started to be tracked in the 1930s, according to an analy-sis of the survey by researchers from Duke University and the Uni-versity of California, Berkeley.
Although Hackett said he does 
notice a growth 
of secularism, he insists less people going to church doesn’t mean they have no beliefs.
“Most people, 
and certainly 
most of the Uni-
versity of Florida undergraduates 
that I encounter, say that maybe they’re not religious, but they are spiritual,” Hackett said.
The survey distinguished athe-
ists, or those who do not believe in 
a God, from those with no religion. 
Three percent of those surveyed claimed to be atheists.
About 19 percent of Americans 
are Protestant, 24 percent are Cath-olics and 1.5 percent are Jewish, ac-cording to the survey.
According to the analysis of the 
survey, the results showed a great-
er portion of men claim no religion 
than women. Also, 21 percent of white people claimed no religion compared with 17 percent of Af-rican-Americans and 14 percent of Mexican-Americans. About one-third of 18- to 24-year-olds claimed 
no religion.
Alexandria Burry, an 18-year-
old UF art freshman, said she 
thinks materialism and the con-stant bustle of today’s society have a lot to do with the lack of religious affiliation.
“I think, as a culture, we are 
very fast-paced and more self-
centered and focused on being the 
best that we don’t rely on a god,” she said. “That is becoming more and more noticeable with time.”

People who continually get gel mani-
cures could be at risk for skin cancer.
The American Academy of Derma-
tology warns the ultraviolet light used to 
seal the polish to the nail can lead to skin 
cancer on the hand.
Lindsey Johnson, a physician assis-
tant at Gainesville Dermatology Aes-
thetic Center, wrote in an email that al-though there isn’t any solid evidence on how much ultraviolet damage can affect the hands, she recommends people pro-tect themselves from the lights.
Johnson, who said she receives gel 
manicures occasionally, uses anti-ultra-violet gloves made without fingertips specifically for gel manicures. When she doesn’t have the gloves, she applies sun-screen to her hands.
“I often go to a salon that uses the 
safer LED light,” she said.
With frequent use, the gel polish can 
also cause nail problems such as nail 
thinning, according to an American Academy of Dermatology news release.
The release said Dr. Chris Adigun, 
an assistant professor of dermatology at 
New York University’s School of Medi-
cine, explained it is unknown whether 
gel manicures weaken nails because of the chemicals in the polish used or the acetone used to remove the polish.
Acetone, which breaks down the pol-
ish, dries the nails and irritates the skin around, according to the release.
“In general, any manicure left in 
place for an extended period of time is 
not a good idea because you are not see-
ing what is going on underneath the nail polish,” she said. “As is the case with most things, moderation is the key when it comes to gel manicures.”
But the risks don’t concern Branta-
nique Williams. The 21-year-old UF tele-communication junior said she’s been getting manicures since she was 18 and 
won’t stop now.
“Honestly, you hear about things 
giving you cancer all the time,” she said. 
“I’m still going to go every two weeks to get my gel nails done.”Manicures may be harmful

As part of Colorectal Cancer Awareness 
month, Screen for Life will offer free colonos-
copy screenings to low-income Gainesville and Alachua County residents.
The program, in partnership with UF 
Shands Cancer Center, Shands HealthCare, the Florida Department of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, seeks to prevent colorectal cancer in vulner-able populations.
Screening events will be held on the re-
maining Saturdays in March in Live Oak and Palatka.
Dr. Thomas George, an oncologist spe-
cializing in colon cancer and director of the gastrointestinal cancer program at the UF Shands Cancer Center, said colon cancer is widespread.
“It’s the second most common cause of 
cancer death in the U.S.,” he said. “The only cancer more likely to cause death is lung can-cer.”George said colon cancer could develop 
if people don’t eat enough fruits and vegeta-bles, if they eat too much red meat or if they don’t exercise enough. Unfortunately, it can also be caused by genetics.
“Some things you have control over, like 
what you eat and what you do, and some things you don’t have any control over, like who your family is and who your parents are,” George said.
For example, despite Michelle Wright not 
eating red meat, shopping at health-food stores and exercising frequently, her bad 
genes led to colorectal cancer.
Wright, 55, was diagnosed with stage three 
colorectal cancer after her first colonoscopy. 
She said 90 percent of people diagnosed with colon cancer are over the age of 50, and 60 percent of cases can be prevented if people get screened early.
“Just do it. Just quit making excuses, and 
do it for your family,” Wright said.Program offers free colonoscopy

21% NOWednesday’s question: Do you think guns 
should be allowed on UF’s campus?Roommate wanted: Must love humor
It’s that time of year again: Ladies can’t go into a bathroom stall after three coffees or for a discreet pre-microeconom-ics exam cry without encountering an 8.5-by-11 sheet of 
printed paper advertising a summer sublet.
The roommate ads you ﬁ  nd blend together after a while. 
They’re all impersonal, offer the same description of the apartment’s amenities and the same promise of a “quiet, re-spectful” roommate.
The last paragraph of the ad urges you to call or email, 
and as the semester draws to a close, the ads take a turn for the frantic: Renters cut the price, offer to pay utilities and sign over their ﬁ  rstborn child if only you could rent their room so they can go to Cabo for two months.
Unfortunately, my roommate is also leaving for the sum-
mer. Well, not really for the summer — she’s skipping town.
I’m in a bit of a bind because she told me last night, so I’m 
searching for a person to live with for the summer and pos-sibly indeﬁ  nitely.
You probably have questions about what it would be like 
to live with me.
Rather than hedge the facts and rely on bland descriptions 
of apartment amenities, I will let you know exactly what kind of roommate I am and what I expect of you.
My home is pet-friendly, and I ask that you treat my dog, 
Winifred Ironwood, with the same respect you would treat a person.
Please also call her by her ﬁ  rst name, as she is a purebred. 
If you have a male dog of pure breed, that would be ideal — I’ve been interested in breeding for a while, although I’d ask that you supply the necessary paperwork. I can’t do Winifred a disservice by spoiling her bloodline. Please, no Australian Kelpies, shar-peis, shih tzus or chow chows. Their coloring would not match Winifred’s, who is a Chinese crested.
If you have other pets, I ask cats be only of the outdoor 
variety, all rodents be spayed and all birds salmonella-free with clipped toenails.
Previous applicants have found my avid doll-collecting off-putting, but fellow American Girl doll collectors should feel free to apply. I keep them displayed in glass cases, and my collection has grown so large over the years that the cases are ﬂ  oor-to-ceiling, wall-to-wall. I love the way I can feel all their beady, glass eyeballs on me at all times: It makes me feel safe.
I should also mention any roommate would have to va-
cate the premises on Wednesday evenings from 3 p.m. to 11 p.m., which is when I take each of my 200-plus plastic friends out for routine cleaning and maintenance.  
I don’t keep any newspapers or magazines in the house, 
otherwise the ink gets everywhere, and the gloss irritates my eyes. Sorry! Feel free to read them on the porch, but they must be stored outside the house.
Just because we would be roommates does not mean we 
can’t be best friends! I am currently looking for a workout buddy to spot me, as my Shake Weight sessions can get pret-ty out of control. 
I also enjoy many fun hobbies such as amateur parkour, 
extreme couponing and competitive juggling.
Potential roommates should be aware they would have to 
undergo a rigorous application approval process.
Applicants would be provided with a comprehensive 
handbook for being my roommate, including my prefer-ences on your personal hygiene habits and diet (no cooking with cumin, curry or chili powder — the smells irritate my nose and turn my stomach, which is problematic, given my abnormal hair-trigger vomit reﬂ  ex).
Inquiries should be emailed to liddlekiddlez@hotmail.
com or via Neomail on the Neopets website, if you have an account. I check mine quite frequently.
I look forward to meeting my new roommate and BFF!Chloe Finch is a journalism sophomore at UF. Her column 
runs on Thursdays. Yes, this is a parody piece.God Hates No One: 
Colorful protest 
against the WBC 
It started almost a year ago.
Josef Miles was 9 years old in May 2012 when he held up 
a sign near a group of Westboro Baptist Church protesters at  
Washburn University in Topeka, Kan. The group’s signs were 
full of the usual terrible messages containing awful words that 
only hurt people. Josef’s read: “GOD HATES NO ONE.”
NPR reported that as Josef considered the church’s protest, 
he thought, “I didn’t want everybody to think that Topeka has 
a bad image.” So he “thought about it for a minute” and de-cided “God hates no one” was the right message.  And he said he wrote it because “that is true.” Fair enough.
After that story made its rounds through the media, Aaron 
Jackson decided to do something peaceful right in Westboro’s hometown.
Jackson is “a 31-year-old community-college dropout whose 
other projects have included opening orphanages in India and Haiti and buying a thousand acres of endangered rain forest in Peru,” according to Gawker.
It took him about six months, but after toodling around 
Google Maps in the area surrounding the church’s location in Topeka, Jackson and some friends purchased a house nearby and painted it the color of the pride ﬂ  ag.
“The concept is to show that where there is hate, there is also 
love,” said Jackson, who is also the founder of a Destin-based nonproﬁ  t purposed to “spread peace in a hurting world,” re-ported The Destin Log.
The painted project is called “Equality House.”“The reason I haven’t gotten into the gay rights activism is 
because, in a sense, it’s almost silly — it’s 2013, are we really still in this position? It just seems ludicrous,” he said in a Hufﬁ  ng-ton Post article. “But it is a real issue and kids are killing them-selves. I’ve wanted to do something, and I knew when I saw that 
house for sale that it all came together. Everyone who knows me 
knows that I’m a little crazy, and there’s no red tape in my char-ity. When I want to do something, I do it.”
We deﬁ  nitely support this peaceful form of protesting.“Mike McKessor of Kansas City, Mo., whom Jackson hired to 
paint the house, wondered if other painters were scared to take on a job that is more of a statement against a church known for its political statements,” the Los Angeles Times reported.
“Every neighbor that I encountered was so happy, and ev-
erybody was smiling when they go by,” McKessor told the LA Times. “It was on a busy street, and everybody slowed down and took pictures. I’m not exaggerating. Dang near every car stopped and said, ‘Good job! Good job!’ ... I’ve never had people so happy for painting a house.”
This is just plain delightful. It’s not even, like, offensive to 
anyone. If a rainbow, or multicolored, color spectrum offends you, then you need to rethink your priorities.
Westboro is hopefully losing steam and value in our society: 
We can’t imagine they had much to begin with. But like Jackson said, this is 2013.
Let’s hope they don’t have a weirdly controlling homeown-
ers association.

Quaide Tranter’s Facebook likes include 
his uncle’s law firm and his stepdad’s busi-
ness.
According to a new study, his likes could 
reflect his intelligence.
Researchers from the University of Cam-
bridge Psychometrics Center and Microsoft Research Cambridge analyzed more than 58,000 likes on Facebook and claimed they could determine information such as sexual orientation, political affiliation and intelli-gence.
Tranter,  an 18-year-old UF computer en-
gineering freshman, said his likes reflect his support for family and friends.
“I do it to support them because more 
likes is better for [my family and friends’ businesses],” he said.
Researchers were able to accurately dif-
ferentiate between people’s races 95 percent of the time, sexual preferences 88 percent of the time and religious affiliations 82 percent of the time.
The team also claimed Facebook users 
who like “The Colbert Report” or curly fries are more intelligent than people who do not.
Bruce Floyd, UF’s social media specialist, 
said he is not surprised by the obvious corre-lations, such as a person who likes President Obama, the Democratic National Party and Democrats will probably vote for a Democrat during an election.
However, sometimes people will like 
something not because it reflects who they are as a person but something they want to 
be informed about.
He said a Democrat might like a Repub-
lican page during elections so that he or she 
knows what the party is doing, which could skew the results.
“When the research says Facebook likes are reflections of who you are, I mean, that is a generalization. I understand that,” Floyd said. “But I question the fact that if you like curly fries, it has a direct relationship with 
your intelligence.”
The research also claimed the page, “Be-
ing Confused After Waking Up from Naps,” 
which has 366,000 Facebook likes, is a charac-teristic of heterosexual men.
Tranter, who likes about 40 pages on Fa-
cebook, agreed sexuality can be obvious on Facebook, but Facebook likes cannot fully represent someone.
“I might like a page on Facebook that sup-
ports gay marriage, but I’m not a homosexual man,” he said. “You can’t judge someone by their Facebook likes.”

As screen sizes shrink, tablets 
may start to outnumber laptops 
in UF classrooms.
The International Data Cor-
poration predicts a surge in 
handheld tablet demand based 
on figures from 2012 sales.
After the release of the iPad 
mini in the Fall of 2012, most of the University of Florida Bookstore’s tab-lets sold out, said Brian Lee, a computer manag-er at the bookstore.
Lee, who provides 
many of the technology needs for students and faculty, believes a reason for tablets’ pop-ularity is their convenience. 
Generally, miniature tablets 
are less than 8 inches long, which is about 3 inches longer than a smartphone. About half the tab-
lets sold this quarter had smaller 
screens, according to a news re-lease by the International Data Corporation. 
The bookstore offers two mini 
tablets: the Google Nexus 7 and the iPad mini. The basic 16GB Google tablet costs $199, while 
the 16GB iPad mini costs $329.
The International Data Cor-
poration’s Worldwide Quarterly 
Tablet Tracker estimates tablet shipments will be about 350 mil-
lion by the end of 2017.
Jordan Fincher, a 19-
year-old information systems sophomore at 
UF, owns an iPad mini 
and an iPad.
Fincher likes his iP-
ads, but he is keeping his 
eye on Microsoft for his next mini tablet.
“I’m mostly looking at Mic-
crosoft because the hardware on their new Surface is spectacular, 
but the software is so terrible,” 
he added, “and if Lenovo would come down on price, I might even go to them.”Tablet tech takeover

After they took their seats at the bar and said hello to one 
of the owners, Rob Hatker and his father, Ed, ordered their 
food.
The duo have been regulars at Tupelo Grill for the last 
five months, typically visiting the restaurant five nights a 
week.Rob usually orders the flavor-filled 
conch fritters and a lemon drop from the 
bar, while Ed favors a scotch-soaked rusty 
nail and any seafood on the specials menu. 
However, the food and drink selection is not the only thing the Hatkers value about Tupelo, 4401 NW 25th Place.
“I like the people,” Rob, a 47-year-old 
auditor said. “The servers are top-quality. Rich hires the best people in this town.”   
It’s been more than a year since Susan LoMonte, Richard 
Wenk and Ritchie Reynolds transformed the old Las Marga-
ritas Mexican Restaurant into their own culinary endeavor.Tupelo Grill, formerly Tupelo BBQ Bar and Grill, cele-
brated its first anniversary last month with a name change 
and the introduction of a new menu.
Ed, a 74-year-old retiree, said he thought Tupelo’s recent 
name change was a smart move.
“I think it’s a good idea because people may have thought 
it was only a barbecue place,” Ed said, “and I think it’s im-portant that they understand it’s not just a barbecue place. It’s a grill and a restaurant, and they have a lot of specials.”
One of the new specials is a succulent, hand-cut filet mi-
gnon topped with chimichurri sauce and served with garlic mashed potatoes and fresh seasonal vegetables.Tupelo Grill reaches beyond the regulars with new menu

It has been seven years, four “Saturday 
Night Live” hosting gigs, a handful of feature 
films and a holy matrimony to Jessica Biel since Justin Timberlake released new music.
JT took a musical break to focus on acting 
after his last effort “FutureSex/LoveSounds,” leaving us poor Timberfans with scant new material apart from his kooky duets with Andy Samberg on “SNL.”
On his new album, “The 20/20 Experience” 
(apparently he has a penchant for forward-slashes), Timberlake’s smooth crooning skills, again combined with producer Timbaland’s funky rhythms and beats, are just as strong as 
they were when he brought “SexyBack.”
To be honest, sexy won’t need to be brought 
back for a while after this album — JT’s kept it 
strong on all fronts and all tracks just like we knew he would.
For those who don’t have over an hour to 
spare, here’s the track-by-track cheat sheet:
“Pusher Love Girl”Segueing from the sweeping orchestrated 
intro, this track keeps a light bounce with a thumping bass that accents JT’s sweet fal-setto. The song is soulful and relaxed, setting the tone for the entire album with effortless sensuality.“Suit & Tie” featuring Jay-ZArguably the most pop-centric track — 
and the only one with a guest artist— the first single is light and bubbles into the Michael Jackson “Off the Wall” feel with which Tim-berlake often dallies. The song has slight trac-es of “Rock Your Body” (off his first album, 
“Justified”), which means it’s a great track for 
not only radio but also secret car dancing.
“Don’t Hold the Wall”A sharp juxtaposition, Timbaland’s tribal 
beats overlay Justin’s deep vocal timbre throughout this song. This shows the 
record’s, and Timber-lake’s, musical sensual-
ity. He switches vocally 
from dark and aggressive to sweet and airy. Others may imitate, but JT proves he is king on this track.
“Strawberry Bubblegum”Exiting from the intensity of the previous 
track, this song is much calmer. The falsetto comes back into play heavily here, relaxed 
above the beeping backbeats. This song, like 
almost all of the others, stretches past the stan-dard three- to four-minute pop song mark — a trait seen previously on “Let Me Talk To You/My Love” from “FutureSex/LoveSounds.”
“Tunnel Vision”Fast-paced and thumping, this track is 
more sultry than the rest. Similar to the lyrical passion in “Don’t Hold the Wall,” JT professes “A million people all around, all I see is you.” Violins mixed with Timbaland’s hook-ridden beats give the song a more epic feel.
“Spaceship Coupe”
Sweet and sexy, this track has harmonized 
“oohs” that make Timberlake’s high pitch 
more pronounced. The song could come straight from a ‘70s R&B record if not for the slow, synthesized backbeats.  
“That Girl”After a faux intro to the “JT and the Tennes-
see Kids” big band of sorts, they launch into a horn-ridden, bass-driven slow jam. This one 
goes alongside the album’s opener in terms of 
soul — so much so that you can practically see the band swaying with shoulders bouncing in the back.
“Let the Groove Get In”With a surprising Latin flair, this song is a 
straight-up dance track. Some aspects are lik-ened to “Right For Me” from “Justified,” but this one is less hip-hop and more dance-floor.
“Mirrors”Another radio-friendly track, the sweep-
ing feel of this song is more pronounced with just the right mix of strings and synths. The harmonies are intricate enough to add depth to JT’s varying pitch, which is also just right. This is arguably my favorite track on the re-cord. It takes all of the aspects of his musical-ity and combines them in perfect balance.
“Blue Ocean Floor”A somber exit, Timberlake is slow to 
sing but just as passionate. The solemnity doesn’t trail off the record, instead it opts for a 
rounded-out ending. In true JT fashion, it just 
works. The mix of what could be contrasting elements melds together for a last track that closes out the album’s smooth, sultry circle.

Dear Friend,
It is not worth it. At first, the adventurous and scandal-
ous thought of it is too enticing to pass up. That feeling is like a high, and it gets better the more secrets you keep. The catch is, things like that are not supposed to last. One of two things could happen. This feeling fades, and eventually, either you or the married man will begin to realize what you’re doing is not something you want on your conscience. It could also go the other way, meaning one of you will become too attached, and the other will need to take action to end the fling. You could destroy a couple’s entire future. Even if that destruction is inevi-
table, it isn’t another woman’s place to be the catalyst.Dear Mediocre Advice,
A really beautiful married man is mentoring me at work, and he is only a few years older than I am. Sometimes, he flirts with me, but I would never want to do anything that could potentially wreck his marriage and make his wife upset. What is 
your opinion on being the other woman?
Dear Friend,
Hold it in and never let go. You could just roll over, break wind and then roll back, but it can be a real pain to get out and then back in that comfy spooning position. Also, that may end up looking suspicious. Spooning means trust. Letting one rip as the little spoon would be a violation of that trust. You cannot fart on him, even if it’s silent or it doesn’t smell. Suck it up 
and clench those cheeks.Dear Mediocre Advice,
I was spooning with my boy -
friend the other night. I was the little spoon, and I really needed to fart. What is the protocol for dealing with a situation like that?
Dear Friend,
This is something she may have to learn on her own. You can tell her all the horrible scenarios you think will come from this, but if she truly believes she will be happy living with this guy, she’ll have to find out the hard way. Keep bugging her, and let her know you’re trying to change her mind because you 
care about her and think she deserves better. Dear Mediocre Advice,
One of my best friends is marrying a guy who isn’t good for her. By not good, I mean he doesn’t have a job, he has a previous gambling problem and is in severe debt. He wants her to move to Minneapolis for a job that doesn’t pay. Is there anything I can say to keep her from mak-ing a huge mistake? I’ve already pointed out all 
these red flags, and it has not changed her mind.

Timeless Disney tales were likely 
staples of your youth: on VHS, in books 
and the theme of your birthday party.
Disney aims to bring these classics 
back into your life with a modern twist: 
live action.  “Beauty and the Beast” is 
next in line for a recreation, according to Entertainment Weekly.
Bringing childhood memories back 
to life leads to box-office success, such as with Disney’s “Oz the Great and Power-ful,” which led box offices for a second weekend with $42.2 million, according to the Los Angeles Times.
With live-action recreations of ani-
mated favorites becoming more com-mon, here are five films we think should 
take on a modern look.
“The Little Mermaid”
    Talking fish and a movie set un-
der the sea would be stunning on-screen with today’s movie magic. And besides, who doesn’t love mermaids?
“Aladdin”    This would make for a great 3-D movie. Just think about that magic car-pet ride: epic. A modern spin-off of this would make for some amusing up-to-
date wishes from the Genie.
“Pocahontas”
A live-action version of this classic 
would bring about a setting other than the usual city scene we’re so used to these days. With computer-generated 
imagery, the colors of the wind would really resonate with 
an older audience.
“Pinocchio”
    Minus being 
locked in a cage, this recreation about 
morals could be a moving piece. A 
modern plot on this would not be diffi-cult to come about.
“Mulan”    A fierce female leading role — yes, 
please. “The Hunger Games” proved that a powerful female lead makes for a great movie. The costumes and fight scenes coming to life would make for a box office sensation.Disney: recreate these filmsThe menu has 28 new items
LoMonte, co-owner, said Tupelo Grill 
changed its name to better reflect its menu’s scope.
“We really wanted to express our style 
of cooking that we’ve developed over the 
years,” co-owner Wenk said. “There’s a lot of 
stuff that comes from backyard cookouts.”
The restaurant’s new menu contains all 
of the previous items as well as 28 additions. LoMonte said the new menu includes more grilled food, salads, soups and vegetarian meals. She also said the menu used for the first year had about 60 percent of the origi-nally intended items.
Wenk has been cooking in Gainesville for 
22 years. At 42 years old, he has worked at and managed local restaurant staples like Leonardo’s 706, Ichiban Sushi and the now-closed Ristorante Deneno.
Wenk’s wife, LoMonte, has worked with 
her husband for the last 14 years. LoMon-te, 46, also teaches 10th-grade English at Gainesville High School.
After years of shared experience at restau-
rants, Wenk, LoMonte and Reynolds opened Tupelo.
Reynolds, 44, is Tupelo’s head chef. Hav-
ing lived and sampled food in London, the Middle East and the South Pacific, he incor-porates an eclectic mix of influences into the restaurant’s menu. LoMonte said Reynolds has been cooking with Wenk for 22 years.
When Las Margaritas closed its doors, 
LoMonte saw an opportunity. The trio had found a home that seemed right for them.
Badger Moring Jr., an accountant and UF 
alumnus, has been eating at Tupelo twice a week since it opened. Moring, 32, said some of his friends used to work at Tupelo, one of whom still bartends.
“I like the food because it’s things you 
can’t get anywhere else. Where can you get shrimp and grits anywhere else in town?” Moring said. “The way they make the New York strip is unlike anything I’ve ever had 
before. I really like the uniqueness of the 
food, and the fact that I have friends working here doesn’t hurt.”
Like Ron, Moring espouses the quality of 
Tupelo’s conch fritters. His usual: sweet tea and shrimp and grits with Gouda cheese. He can also be seen stopping by Sunday brunch for a bloody mary or two.
LoMonte said while running the restau-
rant requires a lot of hard work, it is also very rewarding.
“There’s a certain satisfaction in making 
things for people,” Wenk said. “It’s satisfying to give someone something that makes them feel better.”TUPELO , from page 7

 Alligator Writer 
  In its 66-63 loss to Ole Miss in the Southeast-
ern Conference Tournament ﬁ  nal on Sunday 
in Nashville, Tenn., Florida bucked a trend.
  For the ﬁ  rst time this season in a clutch situ-
ation, the Gators went inside. 
  Before Sunday, Florida was 0 of 2 from the 
ﬁ  eld in the ﬁ  nal 30 seconds of a game when trailing by one or two points this year. Both misses were long-range shots by guard Kenny Boynton. The ﬁ  rst was against Missouri on Feb. 19 when behind 61-60 with 9 seconds left. The second came against Kentucky on March 9 trailing 59-57 with 15 seconds remaining.
  But against the Rebels, forward Erik Mur-
phy got the late touch as the Gators trailed 65-63 with 22 seconds left. 
  “I thought that was our best option to either 
get a good post move, or a jump hook, or may-be an inside pivot jump shot or get fouled,” coach Billy Donovan said. “Giving [Murphy] the opportunity to do that I thought gave us the best chance to tie the game.”
  On the play, guard Mike Rosario fed the 
ball to Murphy, who posted up against Ole Miss forward Murphy Holloway on the left 
block. Murphy maneuvered his way into the 
paint and released a right-handed hook shot, but the attempt clanked off the right side of the rim as Holloway pulled down the rebound with 8.6 seconds left. 
  “I wanted to get some action toward the 
basket,” coach Billy Donovan said. “I just felt like in that situation, Erik is a really good free-throw shooter. He’s probably our most consis-
tent guy down inside. He got it in there, and 
he got a shot that he’s capable of making that he didn’t make.”  Although Murphy came up short in the 
clutch against Ole Miss, he said he would be comfortable being the go-to guy late in a tight NCAA Tournament matchup. 
  “If that happens again, I have to try to make 
the play again whether it’s for me or one of my teammates,” Murphy said. “I want to be in that situation, and it’s something I’ve accepted.”
  Frazier providing boost: In his sixth game 
back from a concussion, guard Michael Fra-
zier was nearly automatic from behind the arc early against the Rebels on Sunday. 
  Frazier scored all nine of his points in the 
ﬁ  rst 9 minutes on 3-of-4 shooting from three-point range. At the 11:12 mark in the ﬁ  rst pe-riod, Frazier had half of UF’s points and had outscored Ole Miss 9-6. 
  “The reason we had a 12-point lead going 
into halftime was because of him,” Donovan said.
  During Florida’s 80-58 quarterﬁ  nal win 
against LSU on Friday, Frazier notched 11 
points on 3-of-5 shooting — his highest scor-
ing effort since Feb. 16. The freshman also 
grabbed ﬁ  ve rebounds. 
  But in UF’s 61-51 semiﬁ  nal win against 
Alabama on Saturday, Frazier went scoreless, 
ﬁ  nishing 0 of 3 from the ﬁ  eld. 
  Still, Donovan might consider going to Fra-
zier late in games. 
  “He’s more of a guy that’s a receiver,” Don-
ovan said. “He’s not a guy that can go create a shot. Someone has to go and get one to him. I have no problem with Mike Frazier shooting the ball at the end of the game.”
  
  Yeguete progressing: Despite shooting poorly throughout the SEC Tournament, forward Will Yeguete was active on the boards.
  Yeguete played 58 minutes and averaged 
four points on a combined 3-of-11 shooting. The junior also grabbed 4.3 rebounds per game.
  In UF’s win against Alabama, he scored six 
points and pulled down six rebounds.
  Yeguete has played six games since under-
going arthroscopic surgery to remove bone chips in his right knee on Feb. 8. He missed six 
games with the injury.
  Yeguete had no complications with his 
right knee during three straight days of com-petition. 
  Since returning to the lineup, Yeguete has 
averaged 3.3 points and four rebounds in 16.7 
minutes per game.

END OF GREGULATION
  As people across the nation ﬁ  ll out their brackets, no team 
is causing more crossouts, rewrites and do-overs than Flori-
da. 
  Without question, the Gators are the most interesting team 
in the 2013 ﬁ  eld. 
  Florida has led the nation in efﬁ  ciency for much of the year, 
usually by a pretty wide margin. 
  Most analysts who employ a progressive, stats-based 
approach love Florida. The model used by statistician Ken Pomeroy gives the Gators a 21 percent chance of winning the tournament, higher than anyone else in the ﬁ  eld. 
  Analysts who approach the tournament more tradition-
ally — I think that’s the nicest way I can say that — point to Florida’s 0-6 record in games decided by single digits as a sign that the Gators aren’t clutch and will fold under pressure. 
  Thus, some in the Twittersphere have tried to frame Florida as a test case in the battle of Numbers People versus Traditionalists.
  This is a ﬂ  awed approach for a 
number of reasons, and I don’t think either side is 100 percent right. The Gators are plenty clutch and plenty efﬁ  cient, but their volatility will ulti-
mately hold them back. 
  As I’ve written before, “clutch” 
isn’t real. Yes, it’s possible to tense up in big moments. To 
shy away from the limelight. To be so scared of failure that making a winning play is nearly impossible. The Gators don’t 
have that problem, as Billy Donovan has said all season long. 
  Each close loss, especially lately, has come down to Florida 
missing makeable shots. In Sunday’s 66-63 loss to Ole Miss, 
bad ofﬁ  ciating, missed free throws and missed open threes were the biggest factors. That’s called bad luck. 
  Turning the ball over late could be a sign of a team crum-
bling under pressure, but UF turned the ball over just once in 
the ﬁ  nal 11 minutes against Ole Miss. 
  As Donovan said, this whole clutch thing is people try-
ing “to create drama around a situation that isn’t necessarily 
true.” 
  Florida beat Alabama by 10 on Saturday. If the Crimson 
Tide had hit a meaningless three at the buzzer, you’d be read-ing about how the Gators proved they could win a close game. The perception of this team would be entirely different based on absolutely nothing. 
  The stats community is with me on this. They understand 
that consistently outscoring your opponent by a wide margin is good.  Florida’s volatility will limit success in Big Dance

Florida will not be facing Meighan Simmons 
tonight in the first round of the WNIT, but the 
Gators are preparing as if they are.   
Simmons, Tennessee’s dynamic junior 
guard, leads the Southeastern Conference in scoring with 17.5 points per game, including a 27-point outburst during a 78-75 overtime vic-
tory against Florida on Jan. 13.
Coach Amanda Butler has used UF’s two 
matchups with Simmons to build a frame of 
reference for Florida International’s Jerica Co-ley, who the Gators (18-14) will have the task 
of limiting. 
Coley, also a junior guard, leads the nation 
in scoring with a school-record 25.9 points per 
game.
Curbing her offensive output will be critical 
for UF to beat FIU tonight at 7 at U.S. Century 
Bank Arena in Miami. 
“[Coley] is very efficient. Simmons is a great 
comparison,” Butler said.
“The young man for Ole Miss, Marshall 
(Henderson), she’s that type of player. She does 
take a lot of shots and has the ball in her hands 
a lot, but she doesn’t take a lot of bad shots, 
she doesn’t force a lot of shots, and she really shoots a pretty decent percentage for as many shots as she takes.” 
Senior Jennifer George is the only holdover 
from Florida’s most recent meeting with Flor-ida International, a 71-60 victory on Nov. 29, 2009. 
Because of the unfamiliarity that exists hav-
ing not played FIU (19-12) in more than three years, Butler utilizes UF’s experience playing against other top guards, such as Simmons, to develop a scouting report. 
“It gives them an idea to attach to because 
that’s one of the things that is unique about 
postseason,” Butler said.
“We come off of a season where we have 
so much familiarity, and we know each other 
by first name and tendencies, (and therefore) we hardly need a personnel scouting report to 
somebody that is completely foreign.”
Coley, a two-time Sun Belt Conference 
Player of the Year, is FIU’s only double-figures 
scorer and is responsible for 42.4 percent of its 
offense this season.
She shoots 43.4 percent from the floor while 
logging 39.5 minutes per game.
“She just is exceptional,” Butler said.
“She has a great pull-up game, a great game 
off the dribble that is not as prevalent in the women’s game and that mid-range game. She has all of it. She is very complete.”
Butler said junior guard Jaterra Bonds, Flor-
ida’s strongest on-ball defender, will be tasked with slowing Coley as much as possible. 
Although there is not much familiarity be-
tween the two teams, Bonds remembers Coley from facing her when the two grew up playing 
basketball in Florida. 
“The only thing I know is they have the No. 
1 scorer in the country,” Bonds said of FIU.
“She averages 25.9 points to be exact. … I 
played against her in AAU. I know who she 
is.”

Florida begins WNIT play tonight against Florida International
Sarah Davis / Alligator 
Junior guard Jaterra Bonds shoots during Florida’s 69-58 win against Arkansas 
on Feb. 28 in the O’Connell Center. Bonds is averaging 12.7 points per game.
The Gators are the only team 
to rank in the top five in both of-
fensive and defensive efficiency. In 
fact, they’re the only team that even 
ranks in the top 10 in both. 
In the past 10 years, only 10 teams 
have finished the year ranked in the 
top five in both categories. Five of 
them won the national champion-ship. Another two were knocked out of the tournament by other 
teams that ranked in the top five 
in both categories. So only three of the 10 have lost an NCAA Tourna-ment game to someone outside that group. 
That some consider UF the fa-
vorite is no wonder. 
When they’re hitting threes, the 
Gators look and feel like the best team in the country. When they 
aren’t, they get labeled choke art-
ists. The efficiency ratings throw all this together, and the good out-weighs the bad such that UF rates really, really well. But the Gators 
are far from danger-free. 
The factor both sides are under-
estimating is Florida’s volatility. As 
the esteemed @NotGregLuca first pointed out to me, analysts have a 
bevy of choices when asked to pick Florida’s X-factor. 
Is Kenny Boynton shooting 
well? Does Mike Rosario have his 
head on straight? Is Patric Young trying? Is Will Yeguete 100 percent healthy? Is Michael Frazier knock-
ing down threes? 
If all of those things go well, Flor-
ida is the national title favorite. If all 
were to go poorly, UF would be an NIT team. Each is nearly impossible 
to predict, so who really knows?
Florida as a whole is erratic be-
cause of its offensive style. The 
Gators take 40.4 percent of their shots from behind the arc, more 
than all but two Final Four teams from the past 10 seasons. They also 
get to the free-throw line less often 
than all but one of the past 40 Final 
Four teams. 
Because three-point shooting is a 
streaky, inexact science, the Gators 
will go on cold spells. Without a 
player who can truly create his own shot and break teams down off the dribble, threes are often UF’s prima-ry source of offense. Thus, Florida’s 
offense is inconsistent. 
If the 2013 NCAA Tournament 
was played 10,000 times, Florida 
would probably lead the field in efficiency but win fewer titles 
than most of the top seeds. The Gators would win some blow outs, 
lose some close games and even 
win some close games, clutch be 
damned. But, more often than not, they’d run into a rough patch some-where in that six-game, 240-minute 
sample that would derail their title 
run.  
So don’t get too worked up over 
the efficiency ratings, and don’t be too worried about clutch. Just rec-
ognize that in a single-elimination 
tournament, going six games with-out an off shooting night is awfully tough.

grEg , from page 15“[FIU guard Jerica Coley] just is 
exceptional. Has a great pull-up game, 
a great game off the dribble that is not 
as prevalent in the women’s game and 
that mid-range game. She has all of it. 
She is very complete.”
