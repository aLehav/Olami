  Halloween is right around the 
corner, but fewer jack-o’-lanterns 
may be showing their faces this year.
  In late August, Hurricane Irene 
damaged ﬁ  elds in the Northeast, and the destruction has some people worried there will be a pumpkin shortage, according to the Associated Press.  Farmers in the region export 
their pumpkins to businesses across the United States, includ-ing Florida.
  Pumpkins are difﬁ  cult to grow 
in Florida but not impossible, said Douglas Gergela, a UF re-search coordinator who has stud-ied pumpkin growth in Florida. 
  Gergela said it takes 70 to 100 
days to grow pumpkins in Flor-ida, and it takes 90 to 120 days to grow pumpkins in the North-east. 
  Gergela said the cooler tem-
peratures in the Northeast in-crease the yield and size of the pumpkins, making them better for the Halloween season. 
  Despite fears of a pumpkin 
shortage, three local pumpkin patches do not expect to have a problem this October.
  Darlene McElwee, owner of 
Magnolia Farms in Live Oak, said business had been normal until media outlets started reporting a shortage. 
  “We’ve been wildly busy, and 
all of the sudden the phones stopped,” McElwee said. 
  McElwee receives her pump-
kins from a farmer in Missouri. She said the farm did experience a loss in pumpkins, but its own-ers still have plenty to sell.
  Both the First United Method-
ist Church of Alachua and Trin-ity United Methodist Church in Gainesville receive their pump-kins from New Mexico. They are expecting bigger pumpkins than usual.
  “We haven’t heard anything 
different,” said Susan Horne, the missions director assistant at the Trinity United Methodist Church, 4000 NW 53rd Ave. 
  She said the church expects 
to receive the usual number of pumpkins for its annual pump-kin patch. The ﬁ  rst shipment of pumpkins will arrive Sept. 30. 
  Pat Harrell, the secretary at the 
First United Methodist Church of Alachua, 14805 NW 14th St., said the church receives about 200 pumpkins each year.
  Last year, Anca Vlasan, a 
19-year-old English sophomore, decorated a Gator-themed pump-kin with her roommates for Hal-loween. 
She is not worried about ﬁ  nd-
ing a pumpkin this year.
  “We just get a small pumpkin, 
nothing too big,” Vlasan said.

  UF continues to seek a way to 
implement a 3 percent raise for 
faculty to offset new state require-ments that has state employees contributing to their retirement.
UF ofﬁ  cals presented options 
for restructuring beneﬁ  ts at Thurs-day’s UF Faculty Senate meeting.
 Vice president for human re-
sources Paula Fussell presented two new options to attendees, say-ing they were tailored to feedback given by faculty since the issue was raised earlier this year.
  Under one option, all faculty 
contributing 3 percent of their sal-ary toward retirement will receive a 3 percent salary increase, and UF would eliminate the payout of un-used sick-leave upon leaving the university . The vacation accrual rate for 12-month faculty would remain the same, at 4.5 weeks per year, but payment upon leaving for the university for unused va-cation hours would drop to 200 hours, and the maximum annual accrual for vacation hours would decrease to 352.
  With the second option, faculty 
contributing 3 percent toward re-tirement could choose between taking the 3 percent raise with the aforementioned beneﬁ  t changes or forgoing the raise and accept-ing no changes to sick or vacation leave payouts and no maximum 
accrual for va-cation hours.Under either option, faculty who retire by June 30, 2016, would main-tain the current 
leave structure. 
  Faculty Sen-
ate chairman Scott Nygren said the options were introduced to incite discussion and are not set in stone.
  “Neither one has been ﬁ  xed on 
yet,” he said.
  He said a ﬁ  nal proposal for the 
change should be ready by early November in order for it to make it to the Board of Trustees meeting in December. Any change approved then would take effect in January.  Faculty hears options

� THE MONEY CAME 
FROM THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES FOR HEALTH.

  UF has repaid about 
$192,000 to the National In-
stitutes for Health following two 2010 audits that found grant money awarded to the College of Health and Hu-man Performance had been used inappropriately. 
  The total repayment of 
$192,148 was for inappro-priate food charges, unsup-ported research participant stipend payments, suspected falsiﬁ  ed payroll hours, home Internet charges and courier services, according to a re-port by UF’s Ofﬁ  ce of Audit and Compliance Review.
  Paperwork involved in 
the repayment process was ﬁ  nalized this week, and the payment was sent to NIH on Wednesday, UF spokeswom-an Janine Sikes said. 
  NIH awarded $502,088 to 
the College of Health  and Human Performance’s Ad-dictive and Health Behaviors Research Institute in 2008 for the “Selective Prevention Program for High School Se-niors” research project head-ed by Chudley Werch.

“I’m sure we’ll be able to find a cheap one this year, too.”
Aerospace engineering sophomore Paula Pluchino, 19, 
says she will purchase a pumpkin this year but will down-
grade to a smaller one if the prices are a lot higher.
“It’s a good idea to continue buying what pumpkins 
there are to support the farmers,” Pluchino said. 
The pumpkins patches at the Trinity United Methodist 
Church and First United Methodist Church open Oct. 1. The pumpkin patch at Magnolia Farms will open Oct. 8, and coupons are available at fun4gatorkids.com to receive a $2 discount off admission.
“Let’s have a nice fall season here,” McElwee said. “We 
don’t have much to be happy about as is. Let’s continue to do business and not be fearful.”4, ALLIGATOR §  FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 23, 2011

Seasons change, but the weather 
in Gainesville remains the same — at 
least for the next four weeks. 
Although today marks the begin-
ning of fall, weather in The Swamp will remain warm and humid throughout the next few weeks, said Matt Zibura, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Jacksonville.
Next week, high temperatures will 
reach the upper 80s, and low tempera-tures will be in the 70s, Zibura said.
For this time of year, the average 
high is 87 degrees, and the average low is 68 degrees.
Tropical Storm Ophelia is currently 
in the Atlantic Ocean but has nothing to do with the current weather, nor is it expected to, said Dennis Feltgen, me-teorologist at the National Hurricane Center in Miami. The official end of the Atlantic hurricane season is Nov. 30.
Ophelia is not expected to become a 
hurricane, and should be running into a lot of wind in the next 48 hours and remaining offshore, Feltgen said.
What is impacting the current 
weather situation is a band of show-ers.
With a 60 percent chance of rain, 
showers and thunderstorms are ex-pected to continue through out the weekend, mainly in the afternoon and evenings. There is a cold front trying to make its way into the Southeast that may reach Central Florida, but it will take a couple of days, Feltgen said.
Even so, temperatures will remain 
with highs in the mid to upper 80s, he said.
“This is very typical of September 
and early October, with high heat and humidity ,” he said. “In Florida we still have a good four to five weeks of what 
we would call summer weather.”Temperatures, humidity 
normal for this time of year4, ALLIGATOR §  FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 23, 2011

Motor vehicle accident fatalities are taking 
a backseat to drug-related deaths in Alachua 
County.
Thirty-seven drug-related deaths were 
recorded in the county in 2009. Twenty-nine motor vehicle accident fatalities were record-ed that same year. This data, provided by the Florida Highway Patrol and the Bureau of Vital Statistics at the Florida Department of Health, reflects a national trend. 
The Los Angeles Times reported Satur -
day that drugs claimed at least 37,485 lives in 2009, surpassing motor vehicles as a cause of death nationwide. Alachua County was no exception.  Gainesville Police Department spokes-
woman Cpl. Angelina Valuri said the police department is working to reduce drug-relat-ed fatalities. 
“The Gainesville Police Department is not 
pleased with the current statistics regard-ing drug-related deaths,” Valuri said. “The department continues to enforce the current drug laws, and by doing so we hope to pre-vent any unnecessary deaths that are related to narcotics.”
She said the police department has teamed 
up with the Alachua County Sheriff’s Of-fice to form the Gainesville-Alachua County Drug Task Force.
Alachua County Sheriff Sadie Darnell 
said that the sheriff’s office is focusing on prescription-medication abuse. “We have and will continue to participate 
in pill take-back programs to assist people in ridding their homes of unwanted or unneces-sary medication to prevent the diversion or theft of prescription meds,” Darnell said in an email.
GPD and ASO arrested five people 
Wednesday in a narcot-ics bust in the Porter’s Oaks neighborhood.  
“The Gainesville Police Department received nu-merous complaints from the residents within the Porter’s Oaks community,” Valuri said. 
Darnell also urged the 
community to help law enforcement fight drug abuse.
FHP Capt. Coby Fincher attributes Ala-
chua County’s declining motor vehicle death count to road safety educational programs and public service announcements.
“Education plays a big part in it,” Finch-
er said. “It’s about getting out and reaching young people early on.”
FHP aims its enforcement initiatives at 
specific areas with higher crash rates. 
“If we look statistically at an area and see 
these crashes are occurring, we’ll target those roadways with enforcement initiatives,” Fincher said. “Enforcement ties in to educa-tion.” 
Provisional data for 2010 proves Alachua 
County consistent in motor vehicle fatalities and drug-abuse death trends. Thirty-two drug deaths and 26 motor vehicle-related deaths were recorded. 
“Although sometimes it seems like an 
impossible goal, we do strive to have no il-legal narcotic activity within the city of Gainesville,” Valuri said.
Drugs surpass car accidents as a leading cause of death

Human Performance, first alerted NIH that there was 
some suspicious activity at the institute that required investigation.
“We decided to look a little closer at some unusual 
expenses,” he wrote in an email Thursday. “Our sus-picions were confirmed.”
“This was our college trying to be proactive and 
do the right thing,” he wrote. “We identified a prob-lem and we took action.” 
A Feb. 24, 2010, memo from Brian Mikell, chief au-
dit executive at UF’s Office of Audit and Compliance Review, to Thomas Hartshorne, supervisory auditor for the Division of Program Integrity at NIH, stated NIH first contacted the Office of Audit and Compli-ance Review in August 2008 regarding allegations of inappropriate use of NIH grant funds at the Addic-tive and Health Behaviors Research Institute in Jack-sonville. NIH formally requested a review by OACR in September 2009. NIH alleged Werch’s student in-terns had been “falsifying work records and charging fictitious labor hours to the grant,” and Werch used grant money to provide gas and grocery cards and food to students and employees, according to audit documents.
An internal review by OACR revealed there was 
no merit to the first claim, but that Werch did indeed use about $33,000 of grant money to feed students and employees over the course of the study. OACR determined the College of Health and Human Perfor -
mance, the Addictive and Health Behaviors Research Institute and UF’s Division of Sponsored Research must pay back $33,604 to NIH.
An Aug. 13, 2010, memo from Mikell to Steve Dor -
man, dean of the College of Health and Human Per -
formance, stated that during the first audit, OACR found more questionable activity at the institute and performed a subsequent follow-up investigation. Auditors found the institute improperly destroyed parental consent forms and receipts for stipend payments to research participants before they were scheduled to be destroyed. There were also discrep-ancies with employee payroll records. 
To prevent these types of issues in the future, 
Dorman wrote in an email that all overtime requests must now be approved by the dean. He has asked the finance and accounting department to notify the of-fice when an employee requests petty cash. 
UPD turned over the audit and investigation to 
the State Attorney in Jacksonville, Sikes said. They have decided not to prosecute. GRANTS , from page 1County consistent with national trend

The UF Center for Leadership 
and Service is looking for students 
to register for the third Gator Glob-al Initiative by Sept. 30. 
Gator Global Initiative is a con-
ference on Oct. 7 and 8. It is de-signed to educate students about social issues and social justice, said Mary Kay Carodine, assistant vice president for student affairs.  
In 2009, when the conference be-gan, about 40 people participated. That number jumped to about 80 in 2010. This year, Carodine said she expects between 140 and 150 peo-ple to participate.
During the conference, partici-
pants will take part in workshops and panels. They will also hear from speakers and experts in the fields of human rights, global health, pover -
ty alleviation, social entrepreneur -
ship and education. It is modeled after President Bill Clinton’s Global Initiative University.
The conference 
costs $20, which includes three meals, a T-shirt and a workbook, 
Carodine said. 
S o c i o l o g y 
sophomore Em-ily Nyren, 19, is 
ready to attend the conference. 
“Once I learned about GGI, I was 
fully on board to commit my week-end to learning more about social injustice and the ways that I can make a difference,” Nyren said.Social justice workshop,

A new collection at Library East has 
books that aren’t only meant to be read 
— they are meant to be interpreted.  One is a handmade pop-up book meant to sym-bolize the maker’s experience as a mother. Anoth-er exemplifies the struggle of being bilingual. 
Some of them contain words, but unlike ordi-
nary books, they were designed with letterpress and ink paintings, and they were made with handmade paper and boxes.
The books belong to artists from across the 
United States and have been brought to UF as part of the ARTBOUND 2011 exhibition. 
ARTBOUND 2011 is the second annual stu-
dent artists’ book competition, exhibition and col-lection, according to Ellen Knudson, an associate in book arts at the Smathers Libraries.
“The competition was designed by myself as a way to promote and build the artists’ book collec-tion at UF,” Knudson wrote in an email, “and as a way for students in Florida and across the nation to have a first experience with getting their books into a special collection library.”
In May, students began submitting entries for 
the competition on the Smathers Libraries web-site. 
No UF students entered the competition this 
year, Knudson said. 
However, UF students in typography, graphic 
design and printmaking classes have used the 2010 books as inspiration for class projects.
Also, a UF graphic design graduate student 
did get her book into the exhibit in 2010.
A guest juror, fine arts photographer and UF 
alumna, Bea Nettles, chose the 15 winning en-tries.
People are invited to attend the exhibit, which 
is located on the second floor of Library East. 
The exhibit is open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Mon-
day through Thursday and from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Friday until Nov. 4, Knudson said. 
The exhibit is also available to view online in 
the exhibits section of ufdc.ufl.edu.
The books will become part of the permanent 
collection in the Special and Area Studies Collec-tion Library in Library East. 
“This is one of the only collections I know that 
features extremely high-quality work by students on the verge in their profession,” Knudson said.Library adds art to bookshelves

33% NOThursday’s question: Do you have finan-
cial aid to help pay your tuition fees?Today’s question: Are you planning on buying a pump-
kin for Halloween this year?Needless to say, there has been a lot of controversy on the 
Alligator’s opinion pages this week.
Our editorial board and columnists discussed everything 
from unions to female politicians to tuition hikes to crazy ani-mal rights activists to the death penalty. 
We hoped you enjoyed the debate and discussion.  So, without further ado, it’s time to move into this week’s 
love-us-or-hate-us-but-hopefully-we-got-you-thinking edi-tion of ...
Darts and Laurels 
In relation to yesterday’s editorial, we hand out a way-to-
kick-him-while-he’s-down DART to the Supreme Court. At 
the last minute, the Supreme Court put Troy Davis’ execution on hold to review the case, keeping him waiting to die for an extra four hours only to say “never mind.” Talk about cruel and unusual punishment. 
Up next, we’re giving a it’s-about-damn-time-we-stopped-
being-backward LAUREL  to the United States government 
for ending “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.” That wasn’t that hard, was it? 
The ridiculousness of this next story led us to throw a way-
to-be-fiscally-responsible-in-tough-economic-times DART to 
UF for having to repay more than $192,000 in misused and 
mismanaged grant money to the National Institutes of Health. Good luck spinning this in your favor.  
Love them or hate them, their influence on alternative mu-
sic is undeniable. We want to give a thanks-for-three-decades-of-innovation LAUREL to REM, who recently announced 
they were calling it quits after 31 years. Let the “end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it” jokes continue.
We stay in the entertainment world for our last stamp of 
disapproval this week. The recipient of our stop-recycling-crap-and-be-original DART goes to Hollywood for ABC’s 
remake of “Charlie’s Angels.” It was a show in the 1970s, two mediocre movie spinoffs in the 2000s, and now, this show tries to restart the franchise again. Stop it, Hollywood. 
Finally, we will be giving a thanks-for-your-cooperation-
and-response LAUREL  to the Gainesville chapter of Stu-
dents for a Democratic Society. Your response to our edito-rial was very well stated and made some valid arguments. We appreciate you taking the time to sit down and write out a response. 
There is a point of clarification, though, that the editorial 
board wishes to briefly discuss. 
The editorial board did not say that SDS does not have the 
right to be here. The SDS seemed to imply that we were being discriminatory against its group, comparing that statement to something from the civil rights era. 
What we were trying to say was that no one has a right 
to a college education, in the legal sense. Of course everyone who is accepted and pays tuition has the right to attend UF. It would be ludicrous to imply otherwise. 
We wanted to make sure the intentions of that statement 
were clear to avoid confusion. 
Have a fun and safe weekend, and be sure to check back 
next week.Americans are increasingly narrow-minded
A couple of days ago my friend and I found a hu-
morous screen shot of a conversation between two friends. The first friend exclaimed, “Osama is 
dead!” and the second friend mistakenly took “Osama” for “Obama” and replied that she could not believe that the president was dead. 
When the first friend corrected her, he added that Osa-
ma used his wives as shields to protect himself from dan-ger. The second friend responded: “like the first lady?” 
While my friend and I had a good laugh after read-
ing the comical conversation, I could not help but wonder how some people can be so ignorant of world affairs, par -
ticularly the ones that demand national attention. 
Don’t get me wrong, the mistake that the second friend 
made was funny, but it is still unacceptable in a broader context. 
The sad truth is that our generation has been so lost in 
the distractions of today’s society that people sometimes forget that there is a world beyond the one around us. 
As technological innovations advance, America be-
comes increasingly progressive. Most of us enjoy the lux-ury of owning our own laptop or smartphone. We have cars that can take us anywhere we want. We have social networking sites that allow us to escape our own lives and spend hours learning about the life of someone else. 
In the midst of all this innovation, we become trapped 
in an ever-expanding bubble. Our vision of the outside world becomes blurred, and we become less and less world aware. When I use the word “we,” I certainly do not mean every American citizen. Many of us who are a part of this societal change manage to become active in truly grasping the world.
Undoubtedly, students have a direct obligation to pass 
their classes and graduate from school. In many cases, this means sticking to the margins of one’s major and do-ing what it takes to succeed in the lifestyle that the major demands. 
Consequently, students are not being exposed to a 
broader scope of knowledge. Some of the most pivotal global issues and national conflicts are being taken for granted, resulting in a wide ar -
ray of narrow-minded individu-als. 
In today’s society, a narrow-
minded person does not neces-sarily equate to an unsuccessful person. This speaks volumes about the types of people that our country is breeding. 
 Some may argue that it is un-
fair to criticize those who are not up to date on the most recent Middle Eastern conflict or the shifting geopolitical landscape of our country. 
After all, these people may be the millionaires creating 
our laptops and TVs, or they may be the overworked stu-dents who are just trying to make ends meet. 
Perhaps, in some way, such people deserve admira-
tion. But in a broader context, is isolating ourselves to a specific lifestyle our only responsibility?
American citizens must become world aware to some 
extent or else risk the chance of our country falling into the hands of unenlightened individuals. Perhaps the big-gest issue is that the tradition of America’s fierce intel-lectualism is at risk. 
In this era of globalization, Americans cannot live in 
isolation. Even though we are still a major player on the international stage, our lead role is shrinking. To avoid being replaced by another country, we must have a solid understanding of national and international issues. Col-lective competency of such issues will allow us to choose the strongest leaders to direct America in the right direc-tion. 
It is only when we are well informed that we gain the 
ability to make the right judgments, distinguish right from wrong, fight for justice, protect our interests and, best of all, create a successful society and a peaceful world.
I urge you to replace the time you normally spend on 
Facebook and read a few news articles.

letters@alligator.org FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 23, 2011 § ALLIGATOR, 7
The state of Georgia killed Troy Davis Wednesday at 
11:08 pm. 
Davis, for those that don’t know, might very well 
have been innocent. 
Twenty years ago, Davis was convicted of the murder of 
a Savannah police officer. Despite seven witnesses for the prosecution recanting their statements and allegations of co-erced testimony, his conviction was upheld. 
Although his lawyers scrambled for a last-minute stay, 
the Supreme Court refused to intervene. After spending 20 years in prison, he was strapped into the chair he would die in, and he sat there for hours as the drama unfolded. 
Poison was pumped into his veins while a group of 
strangers surrounded him. Guilty or innocent, no person could wish for a death like that; no person should wish an-other to die like that.  
But many people seem to have no qualms about demand-
ing that another person die. The death penalty is still legal in 34 states. Since 2006, 265 people have been executed. Were all of these men guilty? Were they all given a fair trial and convicted properly? 
The Innocence Project, an advocacy group that works to 
exonerate wrongly-convicted death-row inmates, says no. Their arguments have been convincing enough to exoner-ate 17  inmates who spent time on death row with post-con-viction DNA evidence alone. It is almost guaranteed that of the 265 individuals who have been executed in the last five years, at least a handful more were innocent. 
New DNA evidence has cast 
doubt on a range of traditional inves-
tigative methods. We know now that eye witnesses are un-trustworthy. Often they can’t remember events well enough to accurately point out a suspect. Other times, their own mo-tives undermine the truth of their testimony. 
One of the nine witnesses who identified Davis as the 
killer has been pointed out by some as the one who actu-ally committed the murder. Only he and one other witness remain committed to their statements that named Davis as the killer. 
Police sometimes intimidate witnesses into saying what 
the prosecution wants. In fact, the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, is something most witnesses just can’t provide: Eyewitness misidentification is partially respon-sible for 75 percent of overturned convictions.  
Even worse, suspects often feel forced to give false con-
fessions by aggressive police interrogation. A host of other dubious practices, from so-called expert testimony to shod-dy forensic science, contribute to the hundreds of wrongful convictions in this country. 
So what? Mistakes happen. Maybe mistakes are just an 
ineradicable part of any system. After all, no institution is perfect, and we can’t expect perfect results. 
True enough, but that doesn’t justify execution. In a prac-tical sense, execution is expensive. States spend more money keeping prisoners on death row than imprisoning them for life. From 1976 to 2000, Florida executed 44 prisoners at an average cost of about $24 million an execution. 
Executions also fail to deter criminals. Homicide rates 
in states without the death penalty are actually lower than those in states with capital punishment.  
Proponents of the death penalty must ask themselves this 
question: Is the state-sanctioned murder of innocent people OK? Are these innocents the lambs we must sacrifice on the altar of justice? 
Clearly, killing an innocent man is not just. At its heart, the death penalty isn’t about compensation. 
It’s not even about “eliminating dangers to society.” It’s only about revenge. 
And revenge can only end in tragedy. We should also question what the death penalty says 
about society. Do we really believe that the state, as long as it follows the proper procedure, is right to take a life? 
Few, I think, would be comfortable with the implications 
of that reasoning. 
Who but the state decides the proper procedure? Who but the state sits in judgment above the accused? When we grant the state the right to kill, we give up our 
own rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.  
The death penalty is un-American. William Tew is a classics senior at UF.

� UF LEADS NATION IN 
RUSHING DEFENSE.
TYLER JETT
Alligator Staff Writer
 
Josh Clemons has been asked 
to run through some narrow 
holes this season. Those lanes are only going to close up more come Saturday.
When the Wildcats’ running 
back takes the field against the No. 15 Gators (3-0, 1-0 South-eastern Conference) at 7 p.m. in Lexington, Ky., Clemons will be going into the teeth of the nation’s best rushing de-fense. Florida has allowed just 92 yards on the ground through three games, including minus-9 against Tennessee last week.
For its part, Kentucky (2-1, 
0-0 SEC) has been one of the country’s worst rushing teams, in part because of a banged-up offensive line. 
Right tackle Billy Joe Mur -
phy has missed the last two weeks with a knee injury and is doubtful for Saturday. Center Matt Smith was out for the first two games with an ankle injury. Right guard Larry Warford is questionable after suffering an ankle injury toward the end of Kentucky’s loss to Louisville last week.
Working with a patchwork 
line, the Wildcats have managed 119.3 rushing yards per game, 
With a 12-hour road trip to beautiful Lexington, Ky., on the horizon, we’re going to 
get right to it this week.
As Southeastern Conference play 
heats up, so does the alligatorSports 
Brand Picks Column. 
This week, we let two writers de-
bate the heated South Carolina-Van-derbilt matchup.
South Carolina (-16) will stop the 
influx to the Commodores’ bandwag-
on because…  
First of all, last week, when South 
Carolina squeaked past Navy, was an aberration, a departure from the norm. 
Steve Spurrier and his boys weren’t 
prepared for that kind of fight from a service academy, but they’ll be ready for Vanderbilt this Saturday. 
Star freshman Jadeveon Clowney 
and the Gamecocks defensive line will handle Vandy up front with ease, bot-tling up the running back duo of Zac Stacy and Jerron Seymour and forcing Larry Smith to beat South Carolina through the air. 
Add in Heisman frontrunner Mar -
cus Lattimore and it’s going to be a 
long day for the ‘Dores. 
— MATT WATTS
Vanderbilt (+16) will send Steve 
Spurrier’s visor into orbit because...
These ‘Dores don’t like to be pushed 
around, as evidenced by Vandy’s sur -
prisingly stout defense this season. 
Currently, the Commodores rank 
20th in the nation in total defense, giv-
ing up just 14 points per game.
They also tout the fourth-best pass-
ing defense in the SEC, allowing just 164.3 yards per game — while the Gamecocks average fewer than that through the air on offense. 
Marcus Lattimore may very well 
get his, but the offense just hasn’t been the same since Stephen Garcia became Picks

The Gators have allowed just 92 yards on the ground through three games, holding Tennessee to 
minus-9 yards rushing last Saturday in a 33-23 win. Kentucky is 10th in the SEC in rushing. 
Gators’ 
top-ranked  defensetough test for ‘Cats
Proof is in the numbers: Brantley untested
For all the pressure and scrutiny John 
Brantley was under in 2010, Florida’s senior quarterback might have the easi-
est job in football right now. 
He is working under maybe the best quar -
terbacks coach in the game in offensive co-ordinator Charlie Weis. He is surrounded by playmakers and can put up 200-yard games without making any real throws. 
Saturday against Tennessee, Brantley 
threw for 213 yards. 
But Brantley’s total yards at the catch — 
that is, the distance his receivers were from the line of scrimmage when they caught the ball — was only 15 yards. Fifteen! 
That number is slightly skewed, because 
four of his 14 completions were screens be-hind the line of scrimmage, resulting in neg-ative yards at the catch. 
Disregarding those, the yards-at-the-catch 
average for his other 10 completions was just 2.9. Think about that for a second. 
Brantley threw the ball an average of few-
er than three yards downfield on his comple-tions. Somewhere in the 8- to 9-foot range. 
Literally every quarterback who has ever 
had the smallest margin of success playing high school or college football could do what Brantley did on Sat-urday. 
He completed 
one throw farther than 5 yards: an 11-yard curl to Deonte Thompson. 
It may sound like 
I’m hating on Brant-
ley here, but the truth is, I’m not. Every quar -
terback in the world derives a portion of their total yardage from yards after the catch, and rightfully so. There’s a measure of talent that goes into finding receivers who have room to make plays and hitting them in stride so they can turn it upfield and eat up that extra yardage. 
But the yards-after-catch total Brantley’s 
playmakers put up Saturday is absurd. Rain-ey and Co. combined for 198 yards after the catch, an average of more than 14 per com-pletion. 
It would be incorrect to say Brantley’s at 
fault for making all these short tosses, be-cause there’s no reason not to. 
But some day, probably soon, a team is 
going to press up on the line and defend the short patterns. And this is where the prob-lems could start. 
Brantley attempted eight passes against 
Tennessee to receivers who were more than 5 yards downfield. He completed just one of them. 
This could be a product of how the Vol-
unteers defended the Gators. They clearly weren’t taking away the short stuff.
Or it could be because Florida’s leading 
wide receiver, Deonte Thompson, has just seven catches for 93 yards, and maybe the players at that position are just bad. Brant-ley, Weis and everyone else with a voice has predictably expressed confidence in the re-ceivers and the offense’s ability to go vertical if need be. 
For the time being, I can’t argue with 
that. 
The offense is taking what the defense 
gives them, and it’s working to the tune of 37.7 points and 442.3 yards per game. But what’s going to happen when defenses stop giving up the underneath stuff?
Since we haven’t seen it yet, I can’t say 
with confidence Florida’s offense won’t be up to the challenge. But, if I were a Gators fan, I wouldn’t be excited to find out.

straight edge.
        
       — TOM GREEN
Leading a five-way tie for first place this week with a 12-
11 record is Tom “I spent my summer flirting with A’s play-
ers” Green, who has been known to creepily stalk the Face-book page of a certain alligatorSports writer’s little sister in search of bikini and prom pictures. Didn’t you hear that PETA has its own free porn site (PETA.xxx) now? Grow up, Tom.  
Joining Tom in first is FightinGators.com’s Cody “Who did 
doughnuts in the outfield?” Jones, who was appalled — ap-palled, I tell you! — Bud Selig would allow America’s past time to be played on the same field that hosted two football games last weekend. We’re sure Cody adjusted his monocle in disgust, too. 
Also sitting at the top is alligatorSports writer Greg “I 
broke the Alligator” Luca, who Inception’d the server in the office last week when he tried to put a folder within a folder, causing it to crash. Good thing we still have that old printing press lying around, Greg.
Still holding strong is our 2009 champ, Kyle “Seriously, 
where is my tinfoil hat?” Maistri, whose cynicism and skep-ticism apparently know no bounds after he likened the end of Mayweather-Ortiz to a fake (It’s pre-determined, dammit!) WWE match. Just because Ortiz is a clown doesn’t mean ev-erything in life is fixed just to upset you, buddy. 
Also clutching to a top spot is alligatorSports assistant edi-
tor Matt “Omar bleepin’ Infante” Watts. If living the life of a Florida football beat reporter wasn’t soul-crushing enough, Omar Infante’s walk-off home run against the Braves may have pushed Watts over the edge this week. It’s OK, Matt, you still have Blaine Gabbert and his glorious, glorious locks.
Sitting in sixth with a record of 11-12 is alligatorSports 
writer Tyler “My months of hard work are ruined” Jett, whose epic, heart-wrenching feature in this week’s paper was sullied by a misspelled name in the center of the two-page spread. Don’t worry, buddy, we still think you deserve a Hearst for it.
Tied for dead-ass last, with a piss-poor record of 10-13 is 
the Florida Times-Union’s Mike “Anyone want my job?” Di-Rocco, who threatened to text in his resignation and leave his phone in the visitor’s locker room this week after we waited around for an hour and a half to interview two whole play-ers.
Also in dead-ass last place with a piss-poor record of 10-13 
is The Associated Press’ Mark “I better not sit too close to the coach” Long, who thought he would avoid being called out in this column by sitting far away from Charlie Weis during media this week. You don’t have to hide your true feelings, Mark. We know you want to sit in Weis’ lap with Mike and 
tell him what you want for Christmas.

10th in the SEC. Even more damn-
ing, Kentucky has allowed 12 sacks, including six last week — 117th out of 120 teams in the nation.  
  “It doesn’t surprise me, but it 
startles me,” Kentucky coach Joker Phillips said. “We’ve got to get it corrected because these guys we have are all we got, and these guys … have had success — a lot of suc-cess.” 
  If Phillips is looking for a quick 
turnaround, he may not be happy with what he sees Saturday. Flori-da’s defensive line has dominated this year. 
  Defensive tackles Dominique Ea-
sley, Omar Hunter and Jaye How-ard were often seen in the backﬁ  eld against Tennessee last week, when running back Tauren Poole was lim-ited to 18 yards on nine carries.
  “I always talk to them about dom-
inate the line of scrimmage, making it a one-dimensional game,” coach Will Muschamp said. 
“You’ve got to be able to do that 
in this league. … If you can make an offense one-dimensional, it’ll give you a chance to win a lot of football games.”
  Muschamp and defensive coor-
dinator Dan Quinn want to see their linemen continue to progress, how-ever, particularly in pass-rush tech-nique. Through its ﬁ  rst two games, Florida managed only two sacks.
  Last week, the group was more 
successful getting to the quarter-back, bringing Tyler Bray down three times. Linebackers Jon Bostic and Jelani Jenkins each notched a sack, and Howard and defensive end Ronald Powell combined on one takedown.
  Still, the Gators’ success last week 
came in part because they could tee off on the Vols. Florida built a two-score lead early, forcing Tennessee to throw the ball more. 
  Quinn wants the group to con-
tinue to improve its pass rush, say-ing its technique isn’t as sound as it can be. 
  “We’re just getting started,” he 
said.
  For Kentucky’s offensive line, 
that is no doubt a scary proposition.

Through seven home games this 
season, Florida has played host to 
two teams ranked in the A VCA Top 25. But it’s tonight’s matchup with an unranked Kentucky team that has UF coach Mary Wise dialed in.
“They’ll be as tough of a match as 
we’ll have all season at home,” she said.
After starting their season in a 2-2 
lull, the Wildcats (11-2, 2-0 Southeast-ern Conference) have reeled off nine victories in a row due in large part to size and physicality.
Kentucky enters Gainesville lead-
ing the SEC in blocks and trailing only South Carolina in kills.
After the first of two film sessions this week, senior outside hitter Stepha-nie Ferrell gave her take on what she has seen from UF’s first home confer -
ence opponent of 2011.
“They’re very consistent and they 
have some nice athletes on their team, so they’re going to push us,” she said.
While the focus with the Wildcats is 
on size and power, they are putting a new focus on defense this year, much like the Gators (8-2, 1-0 SEC).
Junior libero Stephanie Klefot leads 
the SEC in digs with 227 — 90 more than UF defensive specialist Taylor Un-roe. 
“Kentucky is a team that has really 
found itself and it didn’t take long,” Wise said.
Offensively , the Wildcats are led by 
outside hitter Ashley Frazier, a transfer from Alabama who led the Crimson Tide two years ago. 
“They block very well,” Wise said. 
“They have the ability to point-score out of all different rotations. They run a 5-1, and they’re very effective with it.”
Meanwhile, the Gators are coming 
off an easy victory over a middle-of-the-road Mississippi State team. Flori-da managed to help out its conference-leading team hitting percentage with a .327 performance against the Bulldogs. 
With a double round-robin format, 
SEC play brings an air of familiarity that is not present during the early sea-son non-conference slate.
“Having played the players on their 
team in the past, we play a little bit of their tendencies,” junior Tangerine Wiggs said. “It’s exciting to know that you’re going to know something about the people you’re going to play.”
Gators preparing for tough match at home against Kentucky
JOHN BOOTHE
Alligator Staff Writer
 
By her junior year of high 
school, Annie Speese’s road to 
playing soccer for Georgia was seemingly mapped out.
As one of the top young pros-
pects in the state, she had her sights on winning another prep title in 2010, breaking every major school record at the Westminster Schools of Augusta and signing a  scholarship with the Bulldogs upon graduation.
It wasn’t until after then-UGA 
coach Patrick Baker resigned on April 1, that Speese’s almost pre-destined path to Athens, Ga., be-gan to take an unexpected turn.When No. 6 Florida (7-2) faces 
Georgia (6-2) tonight at 7 in UGA Soccer Stadium, Speese — now a freshman midfielder for UF — will be doing more than just taking the field for a Southeast-ern Conference opener. She’ll be playing against the university she had every intention of calling home.
“[Coach Baker] was kind of 
a deciding factor in my decision when I was originally looking at the first schools,” Speese said. “When he left, I just wanted to look at other options.”
Though Georgia quickly hired 
a replacement for Baker in long-time Ole Miss coach Steve Hole-man, Speese backed out of her commitment after receiving the blessing from her parents to look at Florida and Virginia.
“They were just supportive,” 
she said. “They wanted me to be happy and wanted me to go where I wanted to go. I had al-ready looked at several schools 
and I had chosen not to go there, so I wasn’t going 
to look at them again.”
As Speese was reopening her 
recruitment, UF coach Becky Burleigh was trying to wrap up a large and talented class of 12 freshmen recruits. 
But when Burleigh saw a 
player of Speese’s caliber — she scored a state-best 46 goals dur -
ing her junior season — Burleigh took a chance.
“It was actually really late, so 
we’re excited to have her,” Bur -
leigh said. “The main thing she was looking for was some place that could really challenge her soccer-wise and, of course, aca-demically be a good fit too. We were fortunate that we fit the bill.”
With three goals and a team-
high four assists in her first nine games with Florida, Speese also appears to have been a good fit. She immediately fell in love with the campus and was even more impressed with the Gators’ coaching staff.
“We play the same system she 
played in club, which is kind of unusual,” Burleigh said. “Most kids coming in haven’t played the same system we’ve played.”
Junior defender Jo Dragotta, 
who assisted a pair of Speese’s goals against Missouri, has also marveled at how quickly the freshman has picked up UF’s complicated attack. 
Dragotta said she hasn’t seen 
a player come in with the same ability to assist and score since fellow junior Erika Tymrak had five goals and seven assists in her first season.
“She’s all over the field, she’s 
involved in everything and I love that we play in the center and she’s right next to me all the time for a little pass,” Dragotta said. “It makes my job a whole lot easier.”
