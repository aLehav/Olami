From Jimmy John’s employees to 
elementary school students, cycling 
is a way of life for many locals.
But is it safe?Florida came second only to Cali-
fornia in the most bicycle deaths in the U.S. with 329 accidents, just nine shy of the top spot, according to a Governors Highway Safety Associa-
tion report this week. With seven trafﬁ  c cops on the 
road at any given time, Gainesville 
Police spokesman Ofﬁ  cer Ben Tobias said GPD follows state bicycle laws and constantly takes cyclists into ac-count.
Florida also ranked highest for 
most motor vehicle-related cyclist deaths at 5 percent nationally.
“We try to take as much enforce-
ment to bicycle law as much as we can,” Tobias said.
One reason Floridians bike more often is the state’s weather, said Da-kova Batey, Gainesville’s bicycle and pedestrian coordinator, adding that people travel here to cycle too. He credited distracted driving, visibility and lack of bicycle safety education as the main causes of accidents.
“During peak trafﬁ  c times, cer-
tain street signal signs indicate ‘no right turn on red’ to lessen collision with cyclists,” Batey said, as drivers not checking for cyclists during right turns is also a leading cause of col-lisions.

Pulitzer Prize and two-time Emmy winner Hedrick 
Smith will speak at Pugh Hall today.
At 6 p.m., Smith will talk about his new best-selling 
book, “Who Stole the American Dream,” and the decline 
of the middle class. 
“It’s a timely topic, the erosion of the middle class and 
state,” said Gail Sasnett, the assistant director for public 
programs at the Bob Graham Center for Public Service.
In 1974, Smith won a Pulitzer Prize for his collection 
of articles, “The Pentagon Papers,” which exposed the 
truth about the Vietnam War. 
Smith will be signing and speaking about his book, 
which covers electoral politics and the widening gap be-
tween the poor and wealthy. Copies of his book will be 
available for purchase at the event. 
The hourlong event, sponsored by the College of 
Journalism and Communications and the Bob Graham 
Center for Public Service, will include a Q-and-A session 
so the audience can interact with Smith individually.
Students can live-stream Smith’s speech or access it 
later on the website. A bonus interview with Smith will 
also be posted on the website for students to view.
Dani Buchheister, a management and psychology se-
nior, said the talk is important for UF students.
“I enjoy discussion on our country and how it’s 
not the dream that everybody makes it out to be,” the 22-year-old said, “because I think it’s an important thing to realize if we’re going to change.”Pulitzer Prize

A Gainesville man pulled a crack pipe 
out of his butt after being arrested on an out-
standing warrant early Tuesday. 
Tommie Leroy Nobles Jr., 44, was pulled 
over at 1300 E. University Ave for a bicycle light violation shortly before 1 a.m., accord-ing to a report. Ofﬁ  cers did a warrants check and learned that Nobles had a warrant out for cocaine sales and possession. He was then arrested and taken to jail.
As ofﬁ  cers approached the jail to book 
Nobles, he told police he had a crack pipe and proceeded to pull the glass pipe out of his butt. He admitted using it to smoke crack cocaine. 
In sum, Nobles was arrested on his 
warrant and for possession of drug para-phernalia and smuggling contraband into a state cor-rectional facility. His bond is set at $1,045,000.

UF was ranked No. 123 out of 600 of the 
smartest colleges in America.
UF surpassed Florida State University, 
which ranked 166, and the University of Cen-
tral Florida at No. 237. UF  trailed the Cali-fornia Institute of Technology at No. 1 and University of Miami at No. 69, according to 
Business Insider. 
The rankings were based off students’ SAT 
or ACT scores. 
Donna Winchester, UF strategic communi-
cations director, said she was not aware that Business Insider ranked UF at 123. 
“It is a goal of the University of Florida to 
be considered among the top 10 for U.S. News 
& World Report,” Winchester said. “We are 
No. 14 nationally for 2014.”
Winchester said UF has been working to-
ward national preeminence.
The Florida Legislature provides $75 mil-
lion over five years to UF, she said. UF’s pre-eminence focus is interdisciplinary, while 
focusing on majors in science, technology, en-gineering and mathematics.
UF chemical engineering sophomore Mi-
chael Green, 19, said he expects UF to be con-sidered prestigious in comparison to the other colleges in the nation.
“It doesn’t surprise me that UF is ranked 
relatively high,” he said. “UF has high stan-dards. They have to pick the best of the best.”
UF psychology junior Kayla Jackson, 20, 
said she believes UF’s rankings will improve due to its plan for national preeminence.
“The only way is to go up, and I believe that 
is why they named the campaign ‘UF Rising,’” Jackson said.
Winchester said national preeminence has 
helped UF continue to become a top college 
in the nation. UF uses funds to construct new 
buildings and hire prestigious faculty and staff.
“Some of the funding has gone to hire the 
best and the brightest professors,”she said.   Business Insider ranks UF 123rd

The New York Times subscrip-
tions are coming back to UF. But 
this time, they’re digital.
A $40,000 budget for an online 
subscription where students can 
access the Times on their smart-
phones, tablets and laptops for free seven days a week was approved at Tuesday’s UF Student Senate meeting.
Subscriptions to the Times 
and USA Today were suspended May 2013 after SG signed a ser-vice agreement for $66,590 but 
only submitted a purchase order 
of $40,000, according to Alligator archives.
“It’s significantly more cost-
effective,” said UF Student Body President Cory Yeffet.
SG is in the final stages of set-
ting up a contract with the Times to get students their subscriptions 
as soon as possible, Yeffet said.
After the budget was passed, 
the Senate discussed election code 
revisions presented by UF Super-visor of Elections Hans Rojas and Judiciary Chairman Bronco Vusk-ovich.Revisions regarding the sched-
uling of mandatory meetings for qualified SG candidates and when political parties are required to submit their list of all senate and executive candidates passed unan-imously. One senator objected to a revision that would regulate write-in candidates, which was created 
in response to the write-in can-
didates for District E, but the bill passed anyway.
“This is giving more time to 
the political parties and the ad-ministration to run the eligibility checks,” Rojas said.
UF Senate President Joseph 
Michaels introduced an education 
accessibility ad hoc committee to 
address the lack of transparency in course fees.
Senate Pro-Tempore Davis 
Bean added that he wanted to in-stall charging stations in the busi-est bus stops on campus. He said students often are not able to use the TransLoc app to track buses 
because their phones are dead.
“We want students to under-
stand we are passing legislation 
that highlights their experience,” Michaels said.The New York Times digital subscriptions to return for students
� GAINESVILLE AND ALACHUA 
COUNTY ARE IN SUPPORT, TOO.
CHRISTINA HUNT 
Alligator Contributing Writer
Mayors from six of the state’s major cities 
including Tampa, Orlando and Tallahassee 
are supporting Amendment 1, which aims to protect Florida’s water and natural resources and will appear on the ballot next Tuesday.
Both the city of Gainesville and Alachua 
County also support the measure.
The amendment made the ballot after pri-vate citizens collected more than 700,000 voter petitions, according to Florida’s Water and Land Legacy deputy campaign manager Pe-geen Hanrahan.
“For many years, particularly from 1980 to 
2009, Florida had a strong commitment to pro-tecting our water resources,” Hanrahan said. “Unfortunately, in the economic downturn starting in 2009, these programs were nearly 
zero-funded.”
Hanrahan, a former two-term mayor and 
two-term city commissioner of Gainesville, 
said the proposed amendment would not cre-ate a new tax. 
Instead, it will designate one third of the documentary stamp tax on real estate trans-fers — which are paid when a mortgage or deed is filed with the state — toward conser-vation efforts. This type of funding source has 
been used for similar purposes in Florida for 
decades, Hanrahan said.
“The funds can be used for water cleanup and protection, management of existing natu-ral lands, restoration of wildlife habitat and even keeping farms, forests and ranches from turning into developed areas but remaining in private hands and in production for growing food and trees,” she said.
Layne Marshall, a UF natural resource con-
servation sophomore, said she believes this amendment is crucial to the security of the 
state’s natural resources.
“Saying yes to Amendment 1 would direct 
more funds toward a brighter future for the 
natural world as well as the world in general for future generations to enjoy and use sus-tainably,” said Marshall, 19.Florida mayors back Amendment 1 to protect environment
Fla has had 329 fatal bike accidents
Beard, 23, said preventing acci-
dents can only do so much.
“If you don’t know proper bike 
safety, you can get into a sticky situation,” said Beard.
More than two thirds of fatally 
injured cyclists were not wearing helmets, the report said. Also more than a quarter of bicycle-related deaths involved cyclists who were under the influence of alcohol.
As a result of increasing bicycle-
related accidents, Gainesville be-gan establishing bike boulevards.
One of these is located on West 12th Street, which starts across from Gainesville High School; cy-clists can utilize this painted path to avoid heavy vehicle traffic on Northwest 13th Street.
Batey said Alachua County’s Bi-
cycle/Pedestrian Advisory Board also launched a campaign called Share the Road encouraging ev-eryone to be aware of each other.
“The road is not for one type of 
user,” Batey said. bikE , from page 1

SANFORD, Fla. — The for-
mer leader of a Florida veter-
ans’ charity that prosecutors said was a front for a $300 mil-lion gambling operation won’t 
face prison time.
Jerry Bass was sentenced 
Monday in Seminole County 
Court. The former head of Al-lied Veterans of America was given credit for his jail time and must pay court costs.
Last year, Bass entered a no-
contest plea to two counts of 
operating an illegal lottery.
Attorney Kelly Mathis and 
his associates built up the net-
work of casinos by claiming they were businesses where customers could buy Inter-net time, when in reality most customers played slot machine games on computers and didn’t use the Internet.
Even though the so-called 
Internet cafes were being oper-ated under the aegis of Allied Veterans of the World, very lit-tle of the $300 million the busi-nesses earned actually went to veterans, prosecutors said.
Kelly Mathis was convicted 
on 103 counts of racketeering, 
helping to run a lottery and 
possessing slot machines. He was sentenced to six years in prison earlier this year but is out on bond pending appeals.
Bass’ attorney, Chuck 
Hobbs, said his client is disap-pointed with the harm to his  
name and reputation.No prison for charity

West Gainesville residents will 
have to wait a little longer to savor 
gourmet ice pops off Archer Road.
The Hyppo was set to open 
its second Gainesville location 
this month in Butler Plaza, but its 
grand opening was pushed back to mid-November following a com-prehensive redesign, said general manager Brent Smith.
Smith said the new shop will 
look more “rustic and industrial” and will sit between McAlister’s Deli and China King. 
“We have a large population of 
current customers that don’t come that often, and they’ve been beg-ging for us to open one on the west side of Gainesville,” Smith said. There’s no set date for the 
grand opening, but Smith said he plans on selling ice pops flavored similarly to those at the downtown store. Some seasonal flavors cur-rently in stock include pumpkin cheesecake and cranberry apple. 
Smith said he hopes The Hyppo 
will open its third Gainesville lo-
cation by Cheese Daddy on West 
University Avenue in December. 
“A lot of the Gainesville popu-
lation doesn’t adventure down-town,” Smith said. 
“At the moment we’re doing 
really well downtown, but a lot of people still don’t know about us and still don’t know who we are or where we are,” he said.
Kim Crowell, a UF museum 
studies graduate student, said her 
favorite flavor is cookies and cream. 
The 26-year-old said she thinks the new location will be more popular because there’s more parking in Butler Plaza than downtown. 
“Any additional locations 
would be more than welcomed,” Crowell said. 
New Hyppo location opening postponed until mid-November

Former state Supreme Court justices par-
ticipated in a panel Tuesday on the challenges 
of implementing law in a biased system. 
UF’s Levin College of Law hosted the con-
versation on Supreme Court justices at 1 p.m.
The panelists in attendance included Mar-
tin Dyckman, former columnist for the St. Pe-tersburg Times; Harry Anstead, former chief justice of the Florida Supreme Court; Marsha Ternus, former chief justice of the Iowa Su-preme Court; and Major Harding, former chief justice of the Florida Supreme Court.
 The panelists discussed the judicial reten-
tion election system, which allows the Ameri-
can people to vote to remove current state 
Supreme Court justices or keep them for lon-ger terms. Harding said the problem with the election of justices is the corruption involved when justices disagree with voters’ opinions.
“The job of a judge is not to do what’s pop-ular,” Dyckman said at the event. “The job of a judge is to swear before God and the court to do what’s right.”
To put things into per-
spective, Ternus discussed her personal experience with being attacked on the retention ballot. In Novem-
ber 2010, Ternus and two 
other Iowa Supreme Court 
justices were removed for voting to legalize same-sex marriage, she said.
“The negative thing about that kind of mes-
sage is that it tells judges sitting on courts ad-dressing issues that generate a lot of debate,” Ternus said, “that instead of consulting law 
books, they ought to consult the latest public 
opinion poll.”
The panelists called for law students both 
in attendance and watching the live stream to step up in the community to stop the attacks on state Supreme Court justices.UF hosts Supreme Court panel

The King Without A Crown will 
bring his reggae hits to the Phillips 
Center for the Performing Arts on Nov. 10. 
Jewish rapper Matisyahu is set to 
perform at the center after opening act Radical Something plays at 7:30 p.m.
Katie Nelson, assistant publicist at 
Grandstand Media & Management who handles the artist’s tour press, said Matisyahu is about to kick off a North American tour in support of his latest album, Akeda. The album was record-ed with his touring band, Dub Trio, and 
produced by bassist Stu Brooks.
Jackie Bontjes, a 19-year-old UF fi-
nance sophomore, said she loves the 
messages behind Matisyahu’s songs.“His song ‘One Day’ really hits home 
for me because it talks about the goals of world peace that we all hope for,”

able to see Matisyahu in concert. Ever since I heard about him three years ago I’ve wanted to see him perform live.”
Tickets for Matisyahu can be bought

safety? Feminism: for everyone, worth ﬁ  ghting for 
I didn’t mean to become a feminist.
It wasn’t exactly part of the big plan. Not that I 
avoided it, but I wasn’t searching for a cause or any-
thing like that. 
I didn’t actively seek out feminism. It just happened 
as a natural result of learning about and realizing all the 
problems that exist in society today.
There are many casual and widely held attitudes in so-
ciety that shame and disrespect women. 
There are a lot of unequal opportunities in the world. 
There is so much injustice. There is so much violence, rape and harm.
Even if by some miracle — a miracle I sincerely wish 
could be real for everyone — a girl’s life is entirely free of casual misogyny, and she claims to not need the women’s rights movement, I still would encourage her to be a femi-nist. Why?
Because there will be another girl, perhaps in another 
city, or in another country, who needs someone to ﬁ  ght for her. Girls need girls to ﬁ  ght for one another.
Sixty-two million girls in the world do not go to school. 
One in six women in America will be a victim of rape in her lifetime, and in 31 states, rapists can sue their victims for visitation rights and custody to children conceived from rape. Throughout the world, nearly 25,000 girls are forced to be “child brides” every day. Women make up 50 percent of the U.S. population, but only 18 percent of Congress.
We need to ﬁ  ght for girls who are denied an educa-
tion by men who are scared of what will happen when women learn to see beyond their own situations. We need to ﬁ  ght for young girls who are sold as sex slaves, girls who are forced to marry men twice their age because their fathers view them as property and girls who are killed and disﬁ  gured for not conforming to the expectations set by society.
We need to ﬁ  ght for the girls who are viewed as too weak or too stupid to pursue what they love, for the girls who have been raped and don’t know it isn’t their fault. For the girls who have been abused and think they deserve it.
Feminism is about more than 
any individual’s experience as a woman. Feminism is about over-
all equality of gender, in every facet of economic, social and political situations.
I love being a girl. I want the world to love and respect 
girls. I want women everywhere to help and respect each other.
We are awesome, and we can do so much for each 
other.
Female friendship is a wonderful treasure, especially in 
the difﬁ  cult years of college when we are all ﬁ  guring out what we want to do in life.
We cheer each other up. We say things like, “That looks 
good on you. You look cute today!” We buy each other coffee when we’ve had a hard day. 
We buy food together and put all the groceries in one 
cart. We send texts that say, “Let me know when you get home safe!” We binge-watch Netﬂ  ix together, and listen to each other’s 2 a.m. worries. We celebrate each other’s victories. We woman-crush-Wednesday each other. We accept one another, support each other’s goals and aspira-tions and comfort one another when those goals are hard to reach.
It’s important for women to support other women. We 
should support females here at UF and girls all over the world who need help — who need a friend.
Feminism is about support. Feminism is inclusive. I am 
a feminist because equality is always worth ﬁ  ghting for.
Sally Greider is a UF English and public relations sopho-
more. Endorsing Crist 
for governor, 
reluctantly
Next Tuesday, Florida voters will go to the polls and de-
cide whether to re-elect Republican Gov. Rick Scott or replace him with Democratic challenger and former 
Gov. Charlie Crist. 
During his re-election campaign, Scott has tried to position 
himself as a savvy business expert capable of bringing new jobs by the thousands to the Sunshine State. 
It’s true that Florida’s economy has improved signiﬁ  cantly 
during Scott’s time in ofﬁ  ce. The unemployment rate is down to 6.3 percent, a sharp decline from the rate of 10.9 percent in Janu-ary 2011 when Scott took ofﬁ  ce. 
However, many of the jobs created in Florida in the ensuing 
years have been low-wage positions in the service and tourism industries. Scott has failed to make the critical investments that 
would strengthen Florida’s economy and create sustainable, 
high-paying jobs. Even with the job growth, Florida’s unemploy-ment numbers still lag behind the national rate of 6.1 percent.
Gov. Scott’s failures have been far more numerous than his 
successes. He has made devastating cuts to a number of criti-cal government agencies, including the Department of Children and Families and Department of Environmental Protection.
Scott’s administration has also been possibly the least trans-
parent in Florida history. The governor’s attempts to circumvent 
public records laws by using private email accounts are deeply 
disturbing. Under Scott, Florida’s government has been rife with corruption, culminating in the resignation of Scott’s former chief-of-staff, Adam McNamara, after he repeatedly ensured the awarding of no-bid contracts to his friends and allies.
The biggest concern about Charlie Crist is that he is a political 
chameleon, changing his views and policy positions to suit the given electoral climate. Now, Crist espouses popular and well-reasoned positions on the most important issues facing Florida.
Crist supports public funding for high-speed rail projects, 
Medicaid expansion, the legalization of medical marijuana and signiﬁ  cant increases in spending on environmental protection and education. Crist has also expressed progressive views on social issues like abortion and gay marriage.
However, in many cases, Crist held precisely opposite views 
during his ﬁ  rst stint as Florida’s governor from 2007 to 2011, when he placed an R next to his name.
It is impossible to know whether Crist will follow through 
on his policies. The likely election of a Republican supermajority  will make it more difﬁ  cult for Crist to keep his promises.
Endorsing Crist for governor is, in some ways, selecting the 
lesser of two evils. However, the differences between these two candidates are signiﬁ  cant and critical. Florida voters can be con-ﬁ  dent that Crist will serve the people of Florida more faithfully and effectively than Scott has, if only because the incumbent governor has set such a low bar. 
It’s time for a change in Tallahassee, even if that means elect-
ing a familiar face. In the race for Florida governor, the Alligator endorses Democrat Charlie Crist.WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 29, 2014

Elections are in less than a week. If 
you are a registered voter, please vote!
Elections are important for the proper 
functioning of our democratic society. The current state of voter apathy in the U.S. is sad. Only 17.5 percent of Florida’s 11.8 million voters cast a ballot in the Au-gust primary.
Voting in state elections is especially 
important. Their smaller scale can have a more direct inﬂ  uence on constituents. Studying the issues to form an opinion for the sake of being an edu-cated citizen is valuable —  just as valuable at 18 as it is at 80 years old. 
Commercials, bumper stickers, yard signs and 
mailers ﬂ  ood the public before every election. The me-dia tsunami can be overwhelming. For some, it may be a turnoff because elections can seem to be a contest for the most publicity and the best smear ads, instead of the best ideas or platform.
However, at the core of it all, there is a candidate 
who wants to represent the people. Push past all the advertising verging on abrasive and cast your vote.
Furthermore, some people don’t make it through 
campaign season and to the ballot box because they think their vote doesn’t count. Hear this: Your vote counts. It may not be the deciding vote on an issue because elections are rarely that close, but collectively, votes change things.
In 2000, George Bush had a mere 327 more votes 
than Al Gore after recounts in the state of Florida, and 6 million people voted.
If all the people who thought their votes didn’t 
count decided not to vote, our policies and govern-ment would most likely look a lot different because our voting pool would be signiﬁ  cantly different.
Additionally, there are no presidential candidates 
on the ballot this year, but state politics, especially Florida politics, can be pretty interesting.
The Florida gubernatorial hasn’t been boring, but 
some may say it’s been a breeze. The Republican par-ty backs Gov. Rick Scott, and the Democrats support Charlie Crist, who was previously a Republican gov-ernor and unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. Senate as an independent.
Despite Crist’s political identity crisis, “Fangate” 
was beyond entertaining. At Broward College on Oct. 15, the second debate between Scott and Crist took place, Scott almost didn’t appear on stage due to the presence of a fan at Crist’s feet. The ofﬁ  cial debate rules said electronics were not allowed.
Aside from the theatrics, a governor 
has the potential to pass policies that af-fect the state. National politics experience a lot of gridlock, but on the state level, bills pass more easily and are more spe-ciﬁ  c to residents. In other words, voting in a state election can have a larger im-pact on the lives of voters.
If you’re disinterested in the candi-
dates for governor, there are environ-
mental, health and judiciary amendments up for vote. The debate over medical marijuana legalization has been hotly and publicly contested.
Finally, if you are a registered voter but are unsure 
of the issues, you still have six days to catch up. Bal-lotpedia.org is an excellent source to read up on the three amendments on the ballot. It offers short but thorough summaries of each amendment, along with the full text.
Every newspaper and television station has been 
covering the race for governor and other political po-sitions. Turn on the TV or make a quick Google search for The Gainesville Sun or the Orlando Sentinel, read a few editorials and news stories and see which side you fall on.
In no way should politics be downsized to a few 
quick reads on the Internet, but if you know nothing about the issues or candidates, these things will prob-ably help voters make more educated decisions.
Whether you are voting early, with an absentee 
ballot or on Election Day, props to you! If you are con-sidering not voting because it seems your vote doesn’t make a difference or the issues just aren’t very impor-tant, please, reconsider. If you’re voting but don’t know much about current state politics, do some re-search before casting your ballot.
To conclude, I have a confession. I am not regis-
tered to vote, and I am actually pretty bummed about the whole thing. I got busy, and my registration form wasn’t sent in on time. If anyone understands not vot-ing, it’s me.
However, especially because I can’t proudly bub-
ble boxes at the voting booth for this election, I plead with you, registered voter, to do so.
My last two cents: If you are not registered, go 
ahead and do so now before you get busy and elec-tions sneak up on you again. I know I will.

opinions@alligator.orgAs of 2014, there are 
more than 1.5 million elderly people in the 
care of about 16,000 nursing homes in the U.S. 
It is common for people 
to be sent to nursing homes 
as they become older and in 
need of more medically in-
clined attention. How good is the care in these nursing homes, though?
I have volunteered at 
and visited various nursing 
homes in the past, and I have 
developed a more negative 
outlook on the system itself. The treatment of the elderly is often unsatisfactory and disappointing to me.
Patients are regularly left 
alone for hours, bored and lonely, and I believe this can lead to depression. 
Although I know it is dif-
ﬁ  cult for nurses to focus their attention on every patient at every moment, I don’t think leaving a patient alone for 
long periods of time, espe-
cially in certain conditions, is healthy.
I have worked closely with 
dementia patients this year, and I understand that it can be difﬁ  cult to keep people in that condition entertained at all times. They forget things 
easily and sometimes are im-
possible to carry a conversa-tion with.
I have discovered, though, 
that even the most critical pa-tients with dementia can be entertained by something. 
The hardest part is ﬁ  g-
uring out what that is. It is 
important that they get this 
kind of attention because even if they are “gone” in a way, they are still people 
who need personal care and 
interaction.
I do not think the nurses 
and staff are to blame for this negligence. There are 
overwhelming numbers of 
patients in nursing homes and not enough staff to go around. 
It is the joint responsibil-
ity of the nurses, other staff in the homes and families of the patients to ensure that the appropriate attention is 
given to every patient.
In my time volunteer-
ing at and visiting nursing 
homes, I have noticed that 
the happiest people are the 
ones who are visited by fam-ily and friends — they love to receive visitors who will take an opportunity to spend time with them and talk. 
Even visitors they do not 
know are welcome to many of the people in the homes.
I ﬁ  nd it extremely impor-
tant for them to have these 
opportunities to see the out-
side world they are often cut off from.
 I encourage people to 
take the time to volunteer in a nursing home at some point because it is so meaningful to the patients.
Another problem that I 
ﬁ  nd with the care in nurs-ing homes is the lack of pre-paredness of the staff. 
Frequently, I have ob-
served that staff members are not trained properly in taking care of patients. They take shortcuts and perform basic care tasks insufﬁ  cient-ly.
Again, I think this is due 
to the limited number of nurses in the homes. 
Because there are so few 
taking care of so many, 
they become overwhelmed 
and attempt to work faster than possible to be careful and correct. Nursing homes 
should hire more people to 
allow better care for their pa-tients.
Despite ﬁ  nding nurs-
ing homes disappointing 
and their systems to be in-
adequate at times, I realize they are necessary in many cases. Families often do not 
have the time and resources 
to take care of their elderly relatives.
Still, I think the nurs-
ing home environment and 
care toward patients’ needs 
should be mended. 
It is important that more 
staff members are hired for more accuracy on duty and for family, friends and 
volunteers to visit the el-
derly patients in the nursing homes. Talking and interact-ing with someone will make 
the patients’ days so much 
brighter.

Bondi, will be vying for a second term in Novem-
ber. The 48-year-old Tampa native and UF alumna 
was the ﬁ  rst woman to take the post in 2010.
Her ﬁ  rst term was highlighted by a crime crack-
down. Bondi took on pill mills and prescription 
drug abuse in Florida, championing an anti-pill 
mill law in 2011. Her ﬁ  rst term also looked to streamline human 
trafﬁ  cking laws.

sex marriage in the state of Florida, supporting the delay of a de-
cision on the issue until the Supreme Court ultimately releases a federal ruling on same-sex marriage.George Sheldon (Democrat)

should interfere in decisions women make in consultation with their 
doctors,” he said in a video on his website.
Chief Financial Ofﬁ  cer
Jeff Atwater (Republican)
Republican incumbent Jeff Atwater will run for a sec-
ond term as Florida’s chief ﬁ  nancial ofﬁ  cer. Atwater as-
sumed ofﬁ  ce in 2011 and previously held positions as a member of the Florida Senate from 2002 to 2010, becoming Senate president in 2008, and served as a member of the Florida House of Representatives from 2000 to 2002.
The UF alumnus will focus on efﬁ  ciently managing taxpayer dollars to 
reduce burdens on Florida families. Atwater’s priorities include ﬁ  ghting ﬁ  nancial fraud, streamlining regulations and increasing transparency in government spending. Since taking ofﬁ  ce he has successfully shut down several fraud rings in the state.William Rankin (Democrat)
Democrat William Rankin will bring his back-
ground as a ﬁ  nancial ofﬁ  cer and international busi-nessman to his bid for chief ﬁ  nancial ofﬁ  cer.
He previously served in law enforcement as a 
special agent with the criminal investigator of the U.S. Army. He specialized in ﬁ  ghting economic crime, fraud in government agencies and arson 
investigations.
Rankin said he will take his background in ﬁ  ghting government 
ﬁ  nancial crime and fraud to promote new businesses and jobs in Florida, eliminate fraud and increase transparency.

tative for Florida District 3 in the House of Repre-
sentatives. The UF alumnus was elected into of-
ﬁ  ce in 2012 and has a background in veterinary

Yoho is a supporter of drilling projects within the country, including 
the Keystone Pipeline, alternative energy and abolishing the Depart-
ment of Energy.Congressional Rep. District 3
Marihelen Wheeler (Democrat)
Marihelen Wheeler is vying for a seat in the House of 
Representatives for Florida’s District 3 after an unsuc-cessful bid in 2012 for a seat in District 20.
Wheeler, a Kentucky native, moved to Levy County 
in 1982 to work as an art teacher. She is an activist for Florida water issues, spending eight years as an outspoken advocate for water conservation in Florida 
springs, rivers and coastal waters.

equal pay rights for women, assuring affordable health care, passage of the DREAM Act, adding system transparency and creating a pathway to citizenship for immigrants already in the country.
Wheeler also supports raising the minimum wage, making college more 
affordable and reintegrating vocational training into the public school cur-
riculum.

At the start of the 2014 season, all the buzz 
surrounding the Gators was their spread of-
fensive scheme under new offensive coordi-nator Kurt Roper. 
Things even looked promising in the sea-
son opener against Eastern Michigan in a 65-0 frenzied victory, when Florida 655 yards of offense.
But fast forward roughly three months, 
and UF is at the bottom half in the league in total scoring and passing offense. 
Not to mention it has a 2-3 record in the 
Southeastern Conference and is virtually out of the SEC East race. 
Although it’s true, Roper’s ﬁ  rst year run-
ning the offense and the vast majority of the starters on offense were recruited as more pro style than spread scheme players, Roper has no belief that the reason the offense has been unsuccessful is because it’s Roper’s inaugural year at Florida.
“I really don’t think so,” Roper said. “Ob-
viously, we’re not playing very well offen-
sively, and I think there’s two major factors 
that go into it: we’re turning the ball over and we’re not doing a great job in the passing game.”
In Florida’s last game out against Mis-
souri, it only managed 13 points and had six turnovers. The latter is what Roper continued to stress on Tuesday as the main issue with the struggles offensively. 
“If you look at it, it’s kind of the trend,” 
Roper said. “We were good in the ﬁ  rst game, second game we were pretty good in, I think we had one. It’s been a theme of three until we doubled the three. We’re an offense that has to take care of the football better right now.”
Florida faces off against Georgia — one of 
its most heated rivals since the early 1900s. The Bulldogs defense, coached under former 
Florida State defensive coordinator Jeremy 
Pruitt, ranks ﬁ  fth in the SEC in total defense and has allowed just 19 touchdowns on the year.
“They are multiple defense in general so 
they’re going to create some different looks for us all the time, and so we’ve got to have as many weapons in our bag to answer it,” Rop-er said. “But it’s still going out in executing.”
The coaching staff has ﬁ  nally pulled the 
trigger and has made a quarterback change.  It was announced last week that true fresh-man Treon Harris would make his ﬁ  rst career start against Georgia. 
The No. 3 ranked dual threat quarterback 
prospect in the 2014 recruiting class saw ac-tion in last week’s loss to Missouri, in which he went 8-for-12 on 98 yards and a touch-down. 
He also had an interception and fumble. 
Roper says his improvisation under center is something that stands out from practice. 
“He makes things happen on the practice 
ﬁ  eld that aren’t necessarily designed and are 
maybe outside the design,” Roper said. “It’s 
not different than some of the plays in the 
game the other night, one of the ﬁ  rst moving 
pocket passes we called, they brought a pres-
sure off the edge and he made a guy miss and just made a play.” 
Junior Buck linebacker Dante Fowler, Jr. 
adds the way Harris operates in game-type scenarios in practice isn’t necessarily condu-cive to a typical true freshman quarterback.
“Some freshman come in and they’re not 
able to read defenses and sometimes they get 
shook, but he’s always composed,” Fowler 
said. “He knows that he’s good. He knows that he can do this. And he will.”
While Florida may be unable to reach the 
goal they set at the start of the season —win-ning the SEC East — it shouldn’t be hard for the players to garner up motivation to beat its most hated rival that it has lost to for the past three straight years. UF failing to ﬁ  nd identity due to

After a week to focus on themselves and 
ﬁ  nd their identity, the Gators (3-3, 2-3 Southeastern Conference) now turn 
their attention to their annual matchup in Jack-sonville with the Georgia Bulldogs (6-1, 4-1 SEC). Here are ﬁ  ve questions Florida has head-ing into the matchup.
1.) Can Muschamp ﬁ  nally get a win in the 
series?
Will Muschamp has been on both sides of the Florida-
Georgia rivalry in many respects.He wore both sets of colors — donning the 
red and black from 1991-1994 and has sported 
orange and blue since taking over as Florida’s head coach in 2011.
He saw the game from the ﬁ  eld as a walk-
on defensive back for the Bulldogs, and now views the game from the sidelines as the Gators’ main man.
But one factor has been constant throughout 
all of Muschamp’s experiences in the series: 
He has always been on the losing end of the ball game.
Through seven games in this series, Will Muschamp is a combined 0-7 in the Florida-Georgia rivalry.
He was part of the ﬁ  rst Georgia class to lose all four 
games they played against the Gators.
Now, Muschamp’s senior class has the potential to 
fall into that category pending the outcome of Saturday’s game.
A loss to the Bulldogs would mathematically eliminate 
Florida from contention for the SEC East Title. 
It could also mean the inevitable end of Muschamp’s 
tenure in Gainesville.Five questions to ponder heading into the Florida-Georgia gameKan Li / Alligator Staff

Zach Hodskins, one of four 
true freshmen on Florida’s 2014-
2015 men’s basketball roster, 
enrolled at UF for the Summer 
B term like many other first-year students. 
But Hodskins is unlike many 
others. 
The preferred walk-on from 
Alpharetta, Georgia, was born without the lower half of his left arm. 
But that didn’t stop Hodskins 
from averaging 11.8 points and 1.4 rebounds per game during his senior year at Milton High School. 
Toward the end of the year, 
Hodskins, a 6-foot- 4, 203-pound shooting guard who committed to Florida in October 2013, was averaging nearly 23 points per 
game. 
The business major said he 
has yet to return to Georgia since 
arriving at UF’s campus this past summer. 
He added that he’s been able 
to adjust well to his new life and role on and off the court.Here are five questions with 
Hodskins.  
1. How have you been 
adjusting to the UF basketball program?
“It was a pretty big adjustment 
at first. The guys here are really athletic, really fast game speed but I’ve adjusted really well.”
2. How important is it for you 
to be considered as just another guy on the team?
“Very important. I work just as 
hard as anybody else. I just want to be recognized as a player first and that’s what they see me as 
here and I think I’ve proven that 
to a lot of people. They’ve (UF) always treated me like a player. There never was a moment where they didn’t. Just wanted to make 
sure everybody knew that I’m 
going to come in and work just as hard as anybody else and I want to be recognized for that.”
3. Was there a specific moment 
in your high school career that made you believe you could play college basketball?“It’s just always been in my 
mind, since I was little. I never thought I couldn’t do something. 
I’ve always just set my mind to it 
and went for it and that’s kind of what happened. There was never really a deciding factor, it was just my whole life.”
4. There was a lot of attention 
paid to you by the media when you committed to Florida last October, how was that for you?
“I did like the attention, I 
mean, who wouldn’t? It was a great experience. I never thought anything would ever happen like that. I loved every minute of 
it. The media attention allowed 
to get it (his story) on TV and reach out to other kids that had disabilities and they could see me, that was the best thing about 
it, I think.”
5. What’s your favorite 
movie?
“Chasing Mavericks would 
be my favorite movie. It’s very 
inspirational and I love surfing, I used to surf when I was a little kid growing up on Hilton Head 
Island (South Carolina) for eight 
years.”Five questions with Florida 
freshman guard Zach Hodskins

Florida’s offense is one of the top in the coun-
try this season, and one of the reasons why is the 
team’s balance.
Through 17 games, the No. 8 Gators (13-4, 8-2 
Southeastern Conference) have scored 40 goals, and have the potential to match the 52 goals scored by last year’s team.
However, while the team’s leading scorer Savan-
nah Jordan has still scored an impressive 14 goals 
this season and won SEC offensive player of the 
week three times this year — including this week — she’s likely to fall short of the 22 goals she scored 
last season.
Other teams have taken extra measures to keep 
Jordan from beating them this season, but because 
of this, Florida’s other players have stepped up to 
the plate. 
And they’ve delivered.
Twelve different players have scored the team’s 
40 goals, and nine have sent a ball to the back of the net multiple times this season. 
Jordan said she believes because the team is more 
balanced this season, opposing defenses are having trouble figuring out how to stop the Florida’s of-fense.“Oh it makes it difficult for them,” she said. “I 
know when we’re in our setting and we kind of have our rhythm going, it’s really difficult for teams to defend us. You can kinda feel it in the game.”
Jordan added that because many of the players 
from last year’s team returned this season, there is greater chemistry among the players when it comes to moving the ball around.
Because the ball is being moved around so much 
more — and with better quality — more players are 
getting opportunities to make plays, which is mak-
ing playing more exciting for the rest of the team.
“It’s a lot of fun,” senior forward Jillian Graff 
said about playing in an offense that gives every-
one opportunities to score. “It’s a lot of fun seeing 
people get opportunities to get out there, and play-ing with just a variety of different people who show different things on the field.
“The way we control the ball is something that 
we take a lot of pride in, the way we move the ball around, so having the depth we do on the team. ... I think it shows a lot about our team and anyone on the team can do it on the field.”
Graff also said she didn’t think the team was 
in sync at the start of the season on offense, but through all the work the players and coaches have put in has made the offense dangerous.
Coach Becky Burleigh said she has seen an im-
provement in the offense in just the past few weeks, and she hopes they can continue to play in the same unselfish way to sustain Florida’s current level of performance into the looming postseason.
“We’re definitely a big step ahead of where we 
were two weekends ago,” she said. 
“I think for us it’s just a matter of continuing to 
work out what makes us generate that kind of pres-sure.”UF soccer using balanced approach

UF senior forward2.) How much of a spark will 
Treon Harris provide to the of-
fense?
Fans have seen glimpses 
throughout the season of what Harris can do when he takes com-mand of the offense.
The true freshman threw two 
70-plus yard touchdowns in Florida’s delayed season opener against Eastern Michigan. He sparked the Gators to a fourth-
quarter comeback against Tennes-
see on the road. He led UF to two scoring drives against Missouri — both of which were at least nine 
plays and 63 yards.
While he has done well in 
spurts, it will be interesting to see 
if Harris will be able to sustain that performance throughout an entire 60-minute, high-pressure 
contest.
And Saturday’s game in Jack-
sonville is the perfect test for that.
On paper, Harris has the po-
tential for a big game.
The Bulldogs are ninth in the 
SEC and 48th in the country in 
pass defense (215.4 yards/game), 
which is worse than any other 
conference opponent the Gators have faced to this point.
3.) Can the Gators contain the ‘Dawgs’ run game?
The Gators’ defense has been 
solid against the run all year. They’re giving up an average of just 3.08 yards per rush — good 
for the third-best mark in the con-
ference — have allowed an SEC East-low five touchdowns on the 
ground and have yet to give up 
a rush longer than 30 yards. And that’s including matchups against Alabama’s three-headed monster 
in the backfield (Derrick Henry, 
T.J. Yeldon and Kenyan Drake) and LSU’s freshman phenom 
Leonard Fournette. 
But that could change Satur-
day. Georgia is averaging 265.9 
rushing yards per game and have 
24 rushing touchdowns on the 
year.
Running back Todd Gurley — 
who sat out UGA’s last two games while the NCAA investigated 
whether or not he signed memo-
rabilia for profit — has the chance to return this week.
UGA head coach Mark Richt 
said Tuesday that Gurley has re-ceived “a good bit of reps” and Richt wants him to be to the point that he’ll be able to play well if cleared.
But even without Gurley, who 
averaged 154.6 yards per game in five contests before being sus-pended, the Bulldogs are stacked at the running back position.
In Gurley’s absence against 
Missouri and Arkansas, true freshman Nick Chubb tallied 345 rushing yards and three touch-downs on 68 attempts.
4.) Can Florida get out to a fast 
start?
Under Muschamp, the Gators 
are 9-13 when their opponent is the first to get on the scoreboard — that includes a 1-2 record this season. The one win came against 
Tennessee, when Harris came in with 8 seconds remaining in the third quarter and led Florida to 10 
unanswered points.
The two losses came in a 42-21 
defeat against Alabama and a 42-
13 beatdown by Missouri, where 
the Gators didn’t even get on the scoreboard until the end of the third quarter.
Conversely, Georgia is 98-18 
all-time under Richt and 3-0 this season when they are the first team to score. 
If the Gators want a chance to 
compete against the Bulldogs on Saturday, they need to avoid a slow start and not let the mistakes that have riddled them all season snowball throughout the game.
5.) Will Andre Debose be a 
factor in the return game?
Georgia is giving up a mere 
1.9 yards per punt return this sea-
son, which is the best in the SEC 
and the fourth-best mark in the country. Florida sixth-year senior Andre Debose, on the other hand, is second in the conference and 
fifth in the nation with a 19.8-yard 
punt return average. He is one of six players in the country to have 
multiple punt returns of at least 
50 yards this season.
Field position will be crucial on 
Saturday, and Debose will be vital in helping Florida’s offense start 
out at a manageable spot.WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 29, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15

The last time Florida played Georgia, both teams 
were cruising through the season with winning re-
cords and a promising future.
Since then, the two conference foes have veered 
off in different directions.
The No. 8 Gators (16-3, 10-0 Southeastern Con-
ference) will play their second and final regular 
season match against the Bulldogs (10-11, 2-7 SEC) 
tonight at 7 from Athens, Georgia.
Since the Oct. 10 meeting between the two SEC 
rivals, in which Florida swept Georgia 3-0, the latter has lost four of its last five matches. 
For UF, the victory signified another win add-
ed to its streak, which now rests at 11 consecutive games.
Georgia, a team largely known for its block-
ing and physical style of play at the net, was out blocked seven to four by Florida.
The Gators also held large advantages in kills, 
assists and digs, and limited UGA to .022 hitting from the floor, the Bulldogs’ second worst output 
of the season.
Meanwhile, Florida has outscored its opponents 
15-1 since its last meeting with Georgia.
“As I can stand here and confidently say that our 
team has improved in that time,” coach Mary Wise 
said, “so too will Georgia.”
Georgia’s 6-foot-2 sophomore blocker Desiree 
McCray has come into her own as of late, and even leads UF’s Rhamat Alhassan in blocks per set at 
1.35.
Florida will also have to account for senior In-utiraha Le’au, who didn’t record a service ace in the team’s first meeting but is now third in the SEC 
with 28.
“I think when you play a team with the talent of 
Georgia. ... it brings out your best,” Wise said. “It 
will be a test of our offensive patience.”
Georgia has only played one other ranked team 
this season, falling 3-0 to then-No. 12 Kentucky two 
weeks ago.
As Georgia has struggled, Florida has hit its 
stride.
The Gators’ back row defense has excelled lately, 
setting up junior Mackenzie Dagostino with passes that has allowed her to average 11.30 assists per set 
this season, which is second in the SEC.
Score-wise, Florida hasn’t found itself in a close 
match since its 3-2 loss to Marquette over a month 
ago.
UF’s dominant play has allowed opportunities 
for its reserve players to see extended game action, like freshmen Abby Detering and Samantha Dubiel, and sophomore Denise Belcher.
“What we are is a better team than we were a 
week ago, and our goal will be to be better at the end of this week,” Wise said. 
“We’ll get their best shot and we embrace the 
challenge and know that we’ll have to bring our A-
game.”Striding Florida heads to Athens

A.J. Crouch has accomplished something 
he has never done before in his collegiate 
golﬁ  ng career.
He’s a tournament champion.Crouch captured the individual title at 
the Florida Gulf Coast Invitational in Estero, Florida, after shooting an even-par 72 in the third round.
The junior ﬁ  nished the tournament at 
2-under-par and was the only player in the ﬁ  eld to card a score under-par. 
Prior to the tournament, his best ﬁ  nish 
was a tie for fourth place.
Crouch won the event by two strokes 
over Florida State golfers Hank Lebioda and Josh Lee. Crouch’s three round score of 214 is the lowest of his college career. He is now the only player on the roster who has won a tournament as a member of the UF golf team. Junior Richard Donegan won two events as a freshman at FAU.
“A.J. was playing great, and I was proud 
of him,” assistant coach John Handrigan 
said in a release. “Today, I was deﬁ  nitely 
impressed, not just because he won, but because how he handled himself on the course.
“Coach (J.C. Deacon) and I…we’ve been 
working on his attitude and demeanor on the golf course, and today he had a lot of adversity thrown his way, and he handled it like a man.”
As a team, the Gators ﬁ  nished the tour-
nament in second place, 13 shots behind No. 2 Florida State. 
Florida carded a score of 16-over-par 
over the three days. No teams in the ﬁ  eld 
ﬁ  nished under par. The second-place ﬁ  nish 
for Florida was its second one of the fall sea-
son as it had the same result at the Wolf Run Intercollegiate in September.
Senior J.D. Tomlinson and freshman 
Ryan Celano ﬁ  nished the tournament at 
7-over-par, good enough for a tie for 12th 
place. Celano was in sixth place after the sec-ond round, but struggled on the last 18 holes as he was 6-over in the ﬁ  nal round.
Senior Thomas Stewart carded a 9-over-
par during the three days of play, as he also ﬁ  nished inside the top 20 with a tie for 16th place. Sophomore Ryan Orr shot 11-over-par in the tournament and came in a tie for 
21st place.
Freshman Ramsey Touchberry and 
Donegan competed at the event as individu-
als. Touchberry ﬁ  nished at 15-over-par after a 12-over, 84 in the ﬁ  nal round. Donegan was four strokes behind Touchberry at 19-over-par. 
With the fall season complete and a three 
month break before the Gators’ next tourna-
ment, Handrigan said the second place ﬁ  n-
ish is a good way to ﬁ  nish the fall season.
“We’re never content with second place, 
as we were here to win the tournament,” Handrigan said. “We deﬁ  nitely worked hard, and the guys played hard, and like I said, we’re not always happy with second place, but it’s a good way to end the fall on a positive note. 16, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 29, 2014

Last season, the Florida men’s cross 
country team entered the Southeastern 
Conference Championship riding three ﬁ  rst place ﬁ  nishes in their previous four meets. 
The women also had success entering 
the championship, ﬁ  nishing in the top ﬁ  ve in three of their four meets before the SEC championships. 
Florida was predicted to ﬁ  nish second 
entering the SEC Championship — a meet they would host for the ﬁ  rst time since 2002. 
The Florida men and women exited the 
event with second and fourth place ﬁ  nish-es, respectively. 
Challenges have arisen in 2014, calling 
for different runners and a different story line. With seniors Jimmy Clark and Eddie Garcia ofﬁ  cially redshirted, the men look to other names to step up and ﬁ  ll the gap. 
Sophomore Carlos Miranda and red-
shirt sophomore Mac Reynolds have giv-
en the Gators the production this team has 
asked for. 
Between the two, they have totaled ﬁ  ve 
top 12 ﬁ  nishes in four races. 
Florida coach Paul Spangler knows 
having guys step up in Clark and Garcia’s absence is key. 
“They other guys have had to step up, 
certainly from a leadership role,” Spangler said. “It’s been tough on those two guys to have to sit out. Especially for a guy like Eddie who is really ﬁ  t right now.”
The rest of the men’s 
squad will be rounded out by David Kilgore — whose last two races have been his best this season — Mark Mutz, 
Elliot Clemente, and freshmen Thomas Howell and William Decker. 
Spangler said younger runners will 
look to the experienced runners to ensure 
success on the Alabama course.
“Some of our athletes are familiar with 
this course, it’s where regionals were last 
year,” Spangler said. “So for our experi-enced athletes they have a chance to run a course that they have already seen. For the younger runners, they have a chance to go in and make a name for themselves.”
The women’s team will send four un-
derclassmen runners to Tuscaloosa to compete on Friday. Freshman Lauren Bra-sure and sophomore Taylor Tubbs lead Florida heading into the championship. 
The two runners have placed in the top 
three on UF’s team in every race this year. Spangler will be relying on young runners like Brasure, Tubbs and Becky Greene to have success in Tuscaloosa. 
“Lauren is extremely coachable, she 
had a very good coach in high school,” Spangler said. “She has given the coaching staff 100 percent conﬁ  dence and trust that she knows what she’s doing. She’s gotten tremendously better.”Young roster leading Florida
