In preparation for Memorial Day 
weekend, the Click It or Ticket cam-
paign that started Monday at UF will crack down on motorists who fail to use their seat belts. 
This statewide campaign will run 
until June 2 and aims to prevent death and minimize injury, according to Uni-versity Police. 
The Click It or Ticket campaigns 
are set around times when fatalities in-crease, Ofﬁ  cer William Sasser said, for instance, on Thanksgiving Day, Spring Break and Memorial Day.
In Florida, drivers and passengers 
in the front seat must wear a seat belt, Ofﬁ  cer Gregory Castronover said. State law doesn’t require backseat passengers to buckle up.
“Everyone on or around campus can 
get a $104 seat belt citation,” Castron-over said. “Nobody wants to receive a citation if they don’t have to.”
During the last campaign in March, 
82 seat belt citations were issued on campus, according to an email from Of-ﬁ  cer David Watson. Seat belt usage at UF increased by 4 percent, he wrote.  
Safety belt compliance usually in-
creases every time police hold a Click It or Ticket campaign, Sasser said.
“It starts out in the low 90s then ends 
up in the mid to high 90s,” he said. “We’re pretty good about wearing seat belts around here.”
Visibility and enforcement for the 
Click It or Ticket campaign is credited with helping raise national seat belt use.
Compliance in 2011 was at 84 per-
cent, and by 2012, it reached 86 percent, according to a survey by the National Highway Trafﬁ  c Safety Administra-tion. Seat belt usage in Southern states increased from 80 percent in 2011 to 85 Click It or Ticket campaign

Students receiving Bright Futures 
scholarships have it a little easier this up-coming year.
Those who receive this merit-based 
scholarship will no longer be required to ﬁ  ll out a Free Application for Federal Student Aid form, or FAFSA, in order to obtain it.
A bill signed April 20 by Gov. Rick 
Scott has changed the previous law from May 2011 that required students to ﬁ  ll out a FAFSA form. The law takes effect July 1 and will apply beginning the 2013-2014 school year. 
“Several thousands of students will be 
affected by this,” said Rick Wilder, direc-tor of the UF Ofﬁ  ce for Student Financial Affairs.
Wilder said this change allows stu-dents who are only interested in the Bright Futures scholarship to avoid an extra step if they do not need other ﬁ  nan-cial aid. 
“A number of students…will not have 
to ﬁ  ll out an unnecessary administrative requirement to receive something based on academic rather than need,” Wilder said. 
David Pritchard, a 21-year-old UF en-
vironmental science senior, said it’s less time consuming not to have to ﬁ  ll out a FAFSA form in order to receive some-thing that has already been promised.
Brittany Novak agrees.It will be great not having to worry 
about ﬁ  lling out a FAFSA by the dead-line, the 19-year-old UF food science and human nutrition sophomore said.
“It’s one less thing to worry about,” 
she said, “especially because my dad has been on my back about ﬁ  lling it out.”FAFSA no longer required for

Hipsters are well known for 
their vintage appearance and 
progressive thinking, but their latest trend — causing beer pric-es to increase — might not be so well received.
A study conducted by Res-
taurant Sciences found that a rise in price of Pabst Blue Ribbon is causing a rise in price of inexpen-sive beers like Budweiser and Miller Lite.
“PBR is a good beer for the 
price,” said Perry Fowlkes, a 23-year-old UF computer en-gineering senior. “If I had the choice between that and other beers, it has a better ﬂ  avor.”
The image people associate 
with PBR has added to its ap-peal.
“A lot of times when I drink 
it, I get labeled as a hipster,” Fowlkes said.
Sarah Hamersma, a business 
assistant professor, said inex-pensive brands of beer could be raising their prices in hope of im-proving their status.
“It’s possible that if there’s really this big fall in demand for these other big sub-premium beers that they can’t produce it in bulk anymore, so they’re raising the price to make up for that,” she said.
Kamaron Scholl, a 22-year-old 
UF telecommunication senior, said he hasn’t noticed a change in the price of beer and likes to vary the types of beers he buys. He said he doesn’t usually buy cheap beer because “cheap beer tastes like cheap beer.” 
He also said if a bar doesn’t 
have a wide selection, he’ll order PBR or Yuengling.
Alan Hodges, an extension 
scientist in the UF Food and Re-source Economics Department, doubts the price increase is an attempt to make sub-premium beers seem more prestigious. He said the beer market is very com-petitive and driven by the cost of the primary beer ingredients like barley, wheat and hops, which have seen a recent price increase. 
“Those have a well-estab-
lished market niche with mil-lions of loyal consumers,” he said. “I don’t think they need to make up a more upscale brand out of it. There are so many other upscale brands of beer.” Beer seem more expensive? Thank the hipsters

other level,” said Tom Garrity of the Garrity Group, a public rela-tions firm in New Mexico.
“The challenge becomes 
— how do you respond when someone doesn’t think your food or product is as great as you think it is?”
In Amy and Samy Bouzaglo’s 
case, the bad reviews were com-pounded by their horrible real-ity TV experience. The couple said during a recent episode of “Kitchen Nightmares” that they needed professional guidance after years of battling terrible online reviews. They opened the pizzeria in an upscale Scottsdale neighborhood about six years ago.
“Kitchen Nightmares” fol-
lows Ramsay as he helps re-build struggling restaurants. Af-ter one bite, he quickly deemed Amy’s Baking Co. a disaster and chided the Bouzaglos for grow-ing increasingly irate over his constructive feedback. Among his many critiques: The store-bought ravioli smelled “weird,” a salmon burger was overcooked and a fig pizza was too sweet and arrived on raw dough.
“You need thick skin in this 
business,” Ramsay said before walking out. It was the first time he wasn’t able to reform a busi-ness, according to the show.
Amy’s Baking Co. temporar-
ily closed last week after the epi-sode aired. A Bouzaglo spokes-man said the couple was not available for an interview Mon-day. The restaurant’s answering machine was full. Emails and Facebook messages were not re-turned.
A wall post published last 
week claimed the restaurant’s Facebook, Yelp and Twitter ac-counts had been hacked, but hundreds of commenters ex-pressed doubt. Social media sites show someone posting as a member of the Bouzaglo fam-ily had been insulting customers over negative reviews since at least 2010.
The story bounced across the 
Internet, generating thousands of comments on Facebook, Yelp and Twitter, and prompting nearly 36,000 people to sign a petition on Change.org that asks the Department of Labor to look into the Bouzaglo’s practice of pocketing their servers’ tips.
While many corporations hire 
communications experts to re-spond to every tweet, Facebook message and online review, the wave of digital feedback can be especially challenging for small businesses with small staffs, digital consultants said.
For one thing, there is so 
much online content to wade through. Roughly 60 percent of all adults get information about local businesses from search en-gines and entertainment web-sites, according to a 2011 study by the Pew Internet & American Life Project.
“Customer service is a spec-
tator sport now,” said Jay Baer, president of Convince & Convert, a social media marketing consul-tancy in Indiana. “It’s not about making that customer happy on Yelp. That’s the big misunder-standing of Yelp. It’s about the hundreds of thousands of people who are looking on to see how you handle it. It’s those ripples that make social media so impor-tant.”
In their “Kitchen Nightmares” 
episode, Amy and Samy Bouza-glo are seen yelling and cursing at customers inquiring about under-cooked food or long delays. They blame online bullies.
“We stand up to them,” Amy 
Bouzaglo tells the camera at one point. “They come and they try to attack us and say horrible things that are not true.”
That’s exactly how businesses 
shouldn’t respond, the digital ex-perts said.
“If your policy is to berate the 
customer online, that doesn’t cre-ate good public relations,” Garrity said.
Baer said he tells clients to cre-
ate a response matrix represent-ing different potential complaints that staff can refer to whenever bad feedback arises. Creating the comment chart before the bad publicity hits helps ensure busi-nesses aren’t responding to angry or disappointed customers with their own anger or disappoint-ment, Baer said.
A 2011 Harvard study found 
Yelp’s 40 million reviews dispro-portionately affect small business-es. The research found a one-star increase in Yelp’s five-star rating system resulted in a revenue jump of up to 9 percent for some restau-rants, while chains with sizable advertising budgets were unaf-fected.
“You have to respond 100 per-
cent of the time, whether you like it or not,” Baer said. “Businesses need to assign someone to stay on top of it.”
In Arizona, Amy and Samy 
Bouzaglo had planned a grand reopening ceremony and news conference for Tuesday, but the news conference was canceled late Monday after legal threats from Fox.
Fewer than a dozen people 
were waiting when the restaurant reopened Tuesday. Four guards blocked the door and turned re-porters away. Inside, a smiling Samy Bouzaglo.

Restaurant learns online reviews 
can make or break 
PHOENIX — It was the cus-
tomer service disaster heard 
around the Internet.
An Arizona restaurateur, fed 
up after years of negative online reviews and an embarrassing ap-pearance on a reality television show, posted a social media rant laced with salty language and an-gry, uppercase letters that quickly went viral last week to the delight of people who love a good Inter-net meltdown.
“I AM NOT STUPID ALL OF 
YOU ARE,” read the posting on the Facebook wall of Amy’s Bak-ing Co. in suburban Phoenix. “YOU JUST DO NOT KNOW GOOD FOOD.”
It was, to put it kindly, not a 
best business practice. Add to that an appearance earlier this month on the Fox reality television show “Kitchen Nightmares” — where celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay gave up on trying to save the res-taurant after he was insulted — and you have a recipe for disaster.
“That’s probably the worst 
thing that can happen,” said Sujan Patel, founder and CEO of Single Grain, a digital marketing agency in San Francisco.
In the evolving world of online 
marketing, where the power of word-of-mouth has been wildly amplified by the whims and first impressions of anonymous re-viewers posting on dozens of so-cial media websites, online com-ments, both good and bad, and the reactions they trigger from managers can make all the differ-ence between higher revenues and empty storefronts.
Hotels, restaurants and other 
businesses that depend on good customer service reviews have all grappled in recent years with how to respond to online feedback on sites such as Twitter, Foursquare, Yelp, Facebook and Instagram, where comments can often be more vitriolic than in-person re-views because of the anonymous shield many social media websites provide.
No matter how ugly the re-
views get, businesses need to be willing to admit mistakes and offer discounts to lure unhappy customers back, digital marketing experts said.
“In the past, people just sent 
bad soup back. Well, now they are getting on social media and tell-ing all their friends and friends of friends how bad the soup was and why they should find other places to get soup in the future, so it takes PARTLY

The Florida Department of 
Transportation, the National 
Highway Traffic Safety Admin-istration and law enforcement agencies across the state take part in the campaign, according to a UPD media release.
According to the National 
Highway Traffic Safety Admin-istration, one in five Americans fails to continuously wear a seat belt when driving or riding in a motor vehicle.
In 2011, about 21,000 occu-
pants died in car crashes nation-ally because they didn’t use their seat belts, according to an an-nouncement by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This represents 66 percent of all motor vehicle crash deaths.
The announcement also said 
seat belts saved about 11,949 lives in 2011 and if everyone would have buckled up, an estimated 3,400 additional lives could’ve been saved.
Statistics prove that seat belts 
prevent more injuries than not wearing them, said Sgt. Tracy Hisler-Pace, public affairs officer for Florida Highway Patrol.

you from injuries,” she said, “but it will minimize the severity.”Seat belts

path Monday’s tornado took through Moore, Okla.

AND SEAN MURPHY

MOORE, Okla. — The tor-
nado that struck an Oklahoma 
City suburb this week may have created $2 billion or more in damage as it tore through as many as 13,000 homes, mul-tiple schools and a hospital, of-ficials said Wednesday as they gave the first detailed account of the devastation.
At the same time, authori-
ties released the identities of some of the 24 people, includ-ing 10 children, who perished. While anguish about the deaths was palpable as residents be-gan picking up their shattered neighborhoods, many re-mained stunned that the twist-er didn’t take a higher human toll during its 17 miles and 40 minutes on the ground.
The physical destruction 
was staggering.
“The tornado that we’re 
talking about is the 1 or 2 percent tornado,” Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management Director Albert Ashwood said of the twister, which measured a top-of-the-scale EF5 with winds of at least 200 mph. “This is the anomaly that flattens everything to the ground.”
As response teams tran-
sitioned into cleanup and re-covery, Oklahoma City Mayor Mick Cornett, who sent police and fire crews from his city to assist the effort, said an early assessment estimated damage costs at between $1.5 billion and $2 billion.
The Oklahoma Insurance 
Department, meanwhile, said visual assessments of the ex-tensive damage zone suggest the cost could be greater than the $2 billion from the 2011 tor-nado that struck Joplin, Mo., and killed nearly seven times as many people.
Though there was less than 
10 minutes warning that a tor-nado was on the ground Mon-day and headed for Moore, many in the area are accus-tomed to severe storms. The community of 56,000 people has been hit by four tornados since 1998, and residents were already on alert after week-end storms and days of warn-ings. Because the tornado hit in the afternoon, many others were away from the neighbor-hoods and out of harm’s way at work.
Harold Brooks, research 
meteorologist at the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, Okla., said long-range forecasting models also have dramatically improved and are able to provide insight even a week before a storm strikes.

Talley in Moore, Ken A. Miller in Oklahoma City and Justin Juoza-pavicius in Tulsa contributed to this report.

Construction has begun on the Fred Cone Park Library Branch, 2841 E. University Ave., near the 
Eastside Recreation Center and in front of the Fred Cone Park.
JEANNA ARROYO
Alligator Contributing Writer
With construction underway for 
the newest Alachua County library 
branch, organizers plan to bring expanded resources for residents to Gainesville’s east side. 
The facility will be located at 
2841 E. University Ave., near the Eastside Recreation Center and in front of the Fred Cone Park track, which was completed in March. 
The library currently operates 
out of a modular unit that is about 1,000 square feet. Before, a book-mobile serviced the area. 
“The biggest difference will be 
the space and what you can put in that space,” said Nickie Kortus, marketing and public relations manager for the Alachua County Library District.
Organizers have analyzed 
trends for the community to de-termine the types of resources that best meet residents’ needs, Kortus said. 
The new building will include 
a dedicated eGovernment com-puter where library users can fill out forms and applications, a chil-dren’s area that will offer parenting resources and a teen game station.
“The difference at this particu-
lar branch is that it is a library lo-cated at a city park and recreation center,” Kortus said. “So we col-laborate with the city of Gainesville to improve recreational and educa-tional opportunities in that com-munity.”
The branch also teamed with 
Partnership for Strong Families, which provides child welfare, so-cial and community services to the area. The group will have space to operate out of the new library. 
“All of these pieces come to-
gether to navigate resources that you need to be successful in to-day’s world,” Kortus said. “If you don’t have access (to technology), that is where the library can be that cohesive piece that brings it all to-gether.”
Construction of the building 
projected to be 10,000 square feet is expected to end in December, Ko-rtus said. New library branch to expand in Gainesville’s east sidelocAl

A Gainesville woman was arrested 
Tuesday after she allegedly hit her es-
tranged husband, took his cellphone and backed her vehicle into his truck in the parking lot of West Coast Seafood. 
According to a Gainesville Police De-
partment arrest report, Lashun Fayson, 42, met Ray Fayson at the grocery store’s parking lot, 510 NE Waldo Road, so she could return his Nissan Titan truck.
The Faysons — who are in the process 
of getting divorced — had switched vehi-cles so Lashun Fayson could use the truck to move, said Katrina Alston, Ray Fayson’s girlfriend who saw the incident. 
During the exchange, Lashun Fayson 
became irate at her husband because she was jealous, Alston said.
“Just the fact that he’s with me – that’s 
it. That’s the only thing she could be upset about,” Alston said.
Lashun Fayson handed him gas money 
but then snatched it back, Alston said. 
She slapped him in the face, according 
to the report, and shoved his chest where his pacemaker was located.
Lashun Fayson had already given a set 
of truck keys back to her husband, Alston said, but she refused to return the spare keys.
According to the report, 
she unlocked the truck and took her husband’s cellphone, valued at $200, from the cab of the truck and refused to give it back. 
She also “tried to set 
his clothes on fire in the back of the truck,” Alston 
said.
Then, Lashun Fayson climbed into her 
Grand Marquis and backed it toward Ray Fayson, Alston said. Instead, she hit his truck, and caused 
possible damage to the wheel, according to the report.
“If he wouldn’t have moved, she would 
have ran him right over,” Alston said. “I’m 
standing there, looking like, ‘Are you seri-ous?’”
Lashun Fayson then drove out of the 
parking lot, Alston said. 
About two hours later, police found 
Lashun Fayson the 400 block of Northwest Eighth Avenue and arrested her, accord-ing to the report. 
She was booked into the Alachua Coun-
ty Jail on charges of criminal mischief and domestic battery. 
As of press time, she had been re-
leased.

to lose out on Bright Futures?
71 TOTAL VOTES51% YES
49% NOFriday’s question: Has your bike ever been stolen?I               lay handcuffed to a bench in the basement, listening to 
the woman’s high heels click toward me. She paused to adjust her corset and raised a whip above my spine.
At this point I wondered if I had made a mistake.UF students have about three chances to forge lasting 
summer memories. Aware of this, many of us feel pressured to seek out unusual — maybe even crazy — experiences, whether they pertain to partying, traveling or hunting for internships.
This is a true story about how the most unforgettable of 
summer memories can stem from events we least suspect. A few summers ago I was in an Olive Garden in my home-town, Boston, with my friend, Jake. Halfway through our meal Jake got a phone call.
“I can’t believe it,” he said, returning to the table.Jake was a film student working on a documentary that 
explored the psychology of the dominatrix profession. One of his actors, who was supposed to star in a dramatic re-enactment, had gotten cold feet.
Jake had a reputation for taking re-enactments seriously. 
In fact, his mom once nearly screamed and dropped a basket of laundry because she found bazookas in the basement — replicas for a drama involving an African warlord.
For his latest movie, my friend had taken realism to new 
heights: He found an actual dominatrix.
Intrigued, I asked Jake about the woman’s clients. He said 
they were powerful men who secretly craved an excuse to forfeit control. In one instance, according to the dominatrix, a federal agent stripped and asked her to call her friends. The agent wanted women to insult him as he crawled na-ked.
“Wait,” Jake said, his eyes lighting up. “Didn’t you say 
earlier you wanted to do something crazy this summer?”
My friend kept pressing me to fill in for the actor as we 
left the restaurant and boarded the Red Line. Strangers on the subway stared at us. Presumably, they weren’t used to hearing a man chat about being slapped, whipped and ver-bally belittled.
I woke at 5:40 a.m. Sunday, 
hours before the shoot, because I was too anxious to sleep. As the 
sun rose, a Honda Civic sputtered up to my doorstep. Jake, a cameraman and I rode to a brick apartment complex in Watertown.
Although it was sunny, I imagined thunder crackling 
and the foghorn-heavy soundtrack from “Inception.” The 20-something woman who climbed into the back seat was about five feet tall, with a tightly wound bun of black hair and a lace corset protruding from her jacket.
We traveled in awkward silence to Jake’s parents’ base-
ment, where a five-man crew strung up crimson colored spotlights. Meanwhile, I changed into a suit to look more like a masochistic Wall Street tycoon.
I held my breath as the cameras started, realizing the first 
take would set a precedent for the shoot. Suddenly, a horse whip stung my shoulder, and I blurted out four-letter words that aren’t appropriate for a newspaper column, even one about dominatrices.
Just as I was about to inhale, the whip cracked against 
my spine and lower back. She yanked my hair, pulled me to-ward her and kicked over the bench for the coup de grace.
For the next 180 minutes I endured swats and slaps. When 
a camera man complimented my acting abilities, I told him I was talentless. The yelling was real. Although I didn’t speak to the dominatrix during the shoot, I thought I should say something later that day when we finally dropped her off.
“I met you a few hours ago,” I said, shaking her hand. 
“But I feel like I’ve known you for a really long time.”
Once my bruises faded, I realized that woman in a corset 
taught me a valuable lesson, which may benefit other UF seniors: There will be times when life binds, gags and whips you, but at least you’ll get a story out of it.

It especially hurts to get snagged by the darts.We’ll start off this week’s salvo with some excellent 
news from the science front. Researchers at Cambridge have recently identified the molecular trigger for Alzheim-er’s disease. This discovery may be a critical stepping stone in the formulation of an effective treatment. 
In other science news, NASA granted Systems and Mate-
rials Research Corporation $125,000 to develop a 3-D food printer. The first food set to be printed: pizza. Maybe this is the predecessor to the food replicating machine from Star Trek! We give a LAUREL to the scientists of the world for 
working to solve mankind’s problems, including the lack of 3-D-printed pizza. 
Last week Minnesota legalized gay marriage making it 
the 12th state in the Union to legalize gay marriage. Our favorite Minnesotan, Michele Bachmann, said in a press 
statement that the move “denies religious liberty to people who believe in traditional marriage and who do not want to be forced to violate their conscience and sincerely held religious beliefs.
“For still embracing bogus, bigoted arguments, we toss 
Bachmann a rainbow-colored, bedazzled DART. 
The Obama administration announced this week that 
it would be supporting a shield law for journalists who want to protect their confidential sources. This comes in the wake of a bad week between Obama and the media after the Department of Justice seized phone records from the Associated Press. We give a don’t-think-we’ve-let-our-guard-down FLART to the president in hopes that he’ll do 
more than support us in word when the time comes. 
Do you remember Yahoo? The once-Internet-giant seems 
to have fallen a few paces behind the rest in recent years. This week, Yahoo purchased the widely popular blogging site Tumblr. The site was sold for a whopping sum of $1.1 billion. Who knew that pictures of food, cats and hot peo-ple were worth that much? 
Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer made an encouraging post 
on her own Tumblr blog earlier this week: “We promise not to screw it up. Tumblr is incredibly special and has a great thing going. We will operate Tumblr independently.” We give a that’s-the-spirit LAUREL to Yahoo for promis-
ing to keep Tumblr just the way it is. 
Finally, we would like to hand a LAUREL to each and 
every person who lost a loved one in the recent tornado 
in Oklahoma. The scale-topping tornado struck subur-ban Oklahoma and left empty lots where buildings once stood. 
Despite our technology and advancements, our Tumblr 
blogs and printed pizza, nature is still a force to be reck-oned with. But so is human compassion. Remember that and spread the summer love, Gators!

Chinese philosopher Confucius said, 
“Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life.” 
Well I believe if you choose a major you love, you will never have to study a day in your life.
If you’re anything like me, schoolwork has 
kept you up all night more times than party-ing has. 
Twenty-four-hour Library West and over-
caffeinated beverages are, at times, your two best friends. Your eyes are bloodshot from watching lectures, not from late-night drink-ing. And all you want to do is sleep — but you don’t. You do what you need to do to get the work done.
Gradually, the unmet requirements section 
on your degree audit will disappear, and your complete degree audit will be filled with those sight-for-sore-eyes green check marks that signify fulfilled requirements. You will get to walk across the stage a UF graduate.The hours and hours of studying, sleepless nights, and thousands of dollars of your parents’ money will finally be worth it when you get that de-gree. But will it truly be worth it if the degree you earned places you in a career field that you don’t enjoy?
As an impressionable 18 year old, I con-
vinced myself I was going to be a doctor, so I decided to become a biology major. I want-ed the $150,000—or more—yearly salary. I wanted the word doctor in front of my name. I envisioned my nonexistent children proudly telling classmates their dad was a doctor. But after barely passing my first biology class and hating every minute of it, I began to consider a change.
I decided to think about what I enjoyed do-
ing the most. I love to read, and I love to write, so why not become an English major? I chose my new major based on what I en-
joy doing, and here I am four years later doing what I love — and couldn’t be happier.
Most college students believe they are chas-
ing happiness by choosing a major that would allow them to attain high-paying careers. But I would argue that the main reason most people are so determined to attain monetary wealth is because they believe it will result in happi-ness.
Success in the United States has become 
practically synonymous with the word rich. If someone says that a person is successful, the next question is likely an inquiry into his or her profession.
But are the most successful people truly the 
people who have climbed the ladder the high-est in his or her career field or built a business from the ground up? I say no. While financial stability is surely a key component to success, happiness should be people’s main objective in life.
You likely have your own definition of hap-
piness, and rightfully so. Individual content-ment varies from person to person. However, I personally subscribe to Aristotle’s universal definition of happiness. The philosopher stat-ed, “Happiness is the meaning and the pur-pose of life, the whole aim and end of human existence.” Notice that there is no mention of money in Aristotle’s definition of happiness.
If every career paid the same amount, 
which career would you choose? Are you pur-suing the societal notion of success or are you pursuing your own individual happiness?

opinions@alligator.orgLetters to the Editor
Political ideologies are not the 
answer 
According to an opinion column writ-
ten by T. Emmett Ryan, it is time feminists 
embrace “laissez-faire capitalism,” or, as it is known to others, “rampant capital-ism,” in which all financial transactions are completely free from state interven-tion. Did you hear that, ladies? We ought to stop nagging legislators to promote gen-der equality in the workplace. Instead, we should just shrug our shoulders and accept the fact that women are a commodity of lesser value.
In the utopia envisioned by Ryan, an 
employer can hire anyone he or she wants for any reason and at any wage. In our economy, men just happen to be at a higher value than women, so it only makes sense for them to earn more in wages. If a wom-an wants to be competitive in this market, her best option would be to accept a lower wage. Doesn’t that sound empowering?
Ryan’s logic for this is completely 
sound according to the fundamental laws that govern markets. In order for a state to enforce an equal-pay act, the state would have to assume the cost of labor in a given market and redistribute wealth from the firms to the laborers, thus reducing eco-nomic efficiency. In the case of a market in which women are a lower-valued com-modity, artificially making their value equal to that of men would likewise reduce economic efficiency as well. Furthermore, if a woman’s value is artificially higher than it ought to be, a sexist employer will simply not hire her. Following this argu-ment, the only way a woman can compete in such a market would be to accept a low-er wage and the lower standard of living that comes along with that wage.
From a purely economic viewpoint in 
which efficiency is favored above anything else, this makes complete sense. However, Ryan is failing to understand that if we lived in a laissez-faire economy — for ex-ample if he were to work at a burger joint — he would probably earn less than a dol-lar by the hour since the minimum wage greatly reduces economic efficiency, which places the wage way above economic equi-librium. 
He is also failing to understand that 
sexism, as well as all forms of discrimina-tion, operates systematically. This means sexism is not simply one or a few indi-viduals committing acts of discrimination. It means sexism is a learned behavior re-inforced daily by education, all forms of media and in some cases, laws. Women are not earning 76 cents to each dollar earned by a man because her employer is sexist — it is instead because we live in a soci-ety that places men at a higher value than women.
In fact, Ryan said it himself. Accord-
ing to his article, a woman’s competitive wage is lower, implying that a man’s labor is worth more. The only way to truly em-power women is not to embrace a political ideology, whether right-winged or left-winged. Instead, we need to stop thinking about human beings as units of economic value. We need to start thinking of women and men not as opposites which are intrin-sically different from each other, but as hu-man beings who are valuable because all humans are valuable.

Homestyle chain restaurant 
Wingstop isn’t chicken about ex-
panding in Gainesville. 
The national chicken wing chain 
recently signed a development agreement with local businessman Stan Given that will bring two new locations to the Gainesville area.
Given, who owns the Wingstop 
at 4310 SW 20th Ave., as well as the local Heavenly Ham and Fly-ing Biscuit Cafe franchises, said he anticipates a strong showing at the opening. 
“There’s no other concept like 
Wingstop in Gainesville,” Given said. “Our restaurant has a great fol-lowing, and I’m confident that wing and sports fans will continue lining up as we open new locations.”
Given said the details for the opening of the two new restaurants are still being negotiated. 
Sydney Spofford, a 17-year-old 
UF freshman from Jensen Beach, Fla., said Wingstop’s expansion will give students another opportunity to go somewhere new to eat. 
Although she’s visited Wingstop 
before, Spofford said she want to try more of the restaurant’s 10 sauce fla-vors that coat the cooked-to-order chicken and homestyle side dishes.
“I would like to try the different 
combination of flavors — some-thing new that I have never tried,” she said. 
Journa Cobite, a 20-year-old UF 
sociology junior, said the new loca-tions can give incoming freshmen more options, as well as boost the customer base.
“With the expansion of their new 
locations, Wingstop will be able to gain new customers,” she said.Wingstop expands with

A Miami Beach man was arrested Tues-
day after he allegedly bought three bags of 
dog food stuffed with about $1,800 of sto-len shaving supplies. 
Heriberto Enriquez, 39, tried to leave 
the Super Walmart near Waldo Road with the shaving supplies concealed inside the bags, according to a Gainesville Police De-partment arrest report.
Surveillance video shows Enriquez 
stashing the products into the bags of dog food, according to the report. 
Enriquez paid for the dog food, accord-
ing to the report, and began to walk out of the store. 
As Enriquez passed the registers, Wal-
Mart employee Brent Chewning told En-riquez to stop, according to the report, and Enriquez complied.
He was arrested at about 3 p.m. and 
booked into the Alachua County Jail on charges of grand theft.
During questioning, Enriquez said he 
was released from prison the previous week, according to the report.
“This is the way I make money,” En-
riquez said, according to the report.
As of press time, he remained in jail 
with a bond of $10,000.

On Saturday and Sunday, in addition to the parking spaces offered Friday, spaces can be found on a first-come, first-served basis in the O’Connell Center north lot and garage, the engineering complex lot and the UF Bookstore and Welcome Center garage. 
The event will draw about 7,500 peo-

New shower shoes won’t be 
necessary.
A fake poster with the UF Hous-
ing & Residence Education logo has 
been circulating the Web, showcas-ing a very happy Albert. The im-age, which illustrates a horny rep-tile with his hands down his pants, urges students to “Try the Abstain-ing Alligator Challange.”
The poster asks if students can 
restrain themselves from mastur-bating in the shower for at least one week.
However, Sharon Blansett, assis-
tant to the Associate Vice President for Student Affairs, said the image did not come out of a UF office.
“Given the Internet source of 
the image (www.imgur.com), this is obviously a spoof message,” she wrote in an email.
UF isn’t the first school to be hit 
with a fake masturbation notice.
Other schools that had similar 
memes include Pennsylvania State University, North Carolina State University and Florida State Uni-versity.
Dylan Sutton, a resident assis-
tant at East Hall, said he has never seen the poster before.
Sutton said masturbating has not 
been an issue in his dorm showers, and he didn’t think it was a prob-lem in other dorms on campus.“I think it’s hysterical,” said 
the 20-year-old UF environmental engineering junior. “I don’t think housing made it, but it’s really funny.”
Sutton said it never crossed his mind how he would handle this sit-uation if it happened in his dorm.
“I pray I don’t have to deal with 
it,” he said.

When one of Gainesville’s 
public pools opens for the sea-
son on Friday, a new feature will make a splash: a climbing wall. 
The city added a 16-foot 
“Kersplash” climbing wall to the Andrew R. Mickle Sr., Pool.
Gainesville Recreation 
Manager Shannon Keleher said the wall is one of two in the state. 
“The real story behind 
Mickle Pool, and behind the wall in general, is that we’re trying to generate more inter-est and more walk-in traffic for the pool,” she said. 
Keleher said the city decid-
ed to add the wall to Mickle Pool because admission prices were the lowest of the city pools, and it would be the eas-iest place to generate revenue. 
“It’s a new attraction — 
something that people haven’t seen before, which draws in-terest in the community to come to the pool,” said Eden McGuire, an 18-year-old San-ta Fe College health sciences sophomore.
McGuire, who has worked 
as a lifeguard for two years, said the climbing wall should attract more swimmers this summer.
Although the addition of 
the wall also means more pool rules for children, Keleher said it shouldn’t restrict the good times.
“Having the rules will let 
the kids still have fun, but en-sure their safety,” she said.
The Mickle Pool is located 
at T.B. McPherson Recreation Center on 1717 SE 15th St. Ad-mission is $2.45 for adults and $1.35 for youth. McPherson recreation

� IT RECOMMENDS STATES LOWER
BAC LEVEL FROM 0.08 TO 0.05.
KELCEE GRIFFIS
Alligator Staff Writer
A national recommendation to tighten 
standards that constitute drunken driving 
may not affect Florida, local officials say.
The National Transportation Safety Board 
recently recommended that states lower the legal limit of blood alcohol content that in-dicates drunken driving – currently 0.08 na-tionwide – to 0.05.
More than 100 countries on six continents 
have BAC level limits set at 0.05 or lower, according to a board press release.
“The research clearly shows that drivers 
with a [BAC] above 0.05 are impaired and at a significantly greater risk of being in-volved in a crash where someone is killed or injured,” said NTSB chairwoman Deborah Hersman, according to the press release.
However, Gainesville Police Department 
spokesman Officer Ben Tobias said changing the limit would not necessarily affect DUI enforcement in Florida.
Tobias said Florida’s 
DUI law involves two con-ditions to be considered drunk at the wheel: The driver must either score 
a BAC level of 0.08 on a breath test or display signs of impairment.
Normally, he said, officers simply admin-
ister a field sobriety test.
“For us, honestly, a BAC is an icing on 
the cake,” Tobias said. “The actual number isn’t as important as if the field sobriety is showing that they are impaired.”
State Rep. Keith Perry said talk of chang-
ing the limit surfaced during session in Tal-lahassee, but nothing is definite.
However, he said managing the DUI limit 
could present an effective way to encourage safe driving.
“We certainly need to look at every pos-
sibility of using that without being overly restrictive,” he said.

Figuring out statistical data 
just became a lot easier, thanks 
to Statista.
The George A. Smathers Li-
braries recently became a sub-scriber to www.statista.com, a portal that allows students and faculty to access data from some 60,000 different topics.
“This is an index that has 
thousands of data displayed in a user-friendly form, allowing you to utilize it in different ways,” said UF business librarian Peter McKay.
Any graphical data found on 
the website can be downloaded as a JPEG to PowerPoint or Ex-cel. It can also be printed and viewed in different formats, like bar and line graphs.
“It is a very powerful tool,” 
McKay said. “I think allowing students access to this program will help them understand sta-tistics and the numbers behind it all,” said Alexandra Webel, a 20-year-old UF mathematics and statistics junior.
“A lot of students ﬁ  nd statis-
tics intimidating and difﬁ  cult to understand, but when they are presented with a topic they are interested in, they begin to un-derstand what the numbers and results signify,” Webel said.
The website can be accessed 
whether on or off campus. Stu-dents entering the website on campus have instant access. If accessing it while at home, stu-dents can enter Statista through the Smathers Libraries website using their GatorLink login in-formation.New stats portal availabletheAvenue    THURSDAY, MAY 23, 2013

Attention reality TV junk-
ies: Think you’ve heard all 
there is to know about the casts of MTV’s most notori-ous reality shows “16 and Pregnant” and “Teen Mom”?  Have you watched every epi-sode more than once, perused the tabloids and blog head-lines, followed the tweets, and perhaps even Googled paparazzi photos more times than you’d like to admit?  
Never fear, you’re not 
alone. And to amp up your addiction a little more, real-ity TV blogger Ashley Majes-ki has joined forces with Sean Daly, New York Post journal-ist and former TMZ producer, to bring you the book, “Teen Mom Conﬁ  dential: Secrets and Scandals from MTV’s Most Controversial Show.”  A no-nonsense, tell-all 
book brimming with behind-the-scenes gossip that cam-eras didn’t capture, “Teen Mom Conﬁ  dential” delivers insights about moms Am-ber Portwood, Jenelle Evans, Kailyn Lowry, Maci Bookout, Farrah Abraham, Catelynn Lowell, Chelsea Houska and Leah Messer that will shock even the most die-hard fans. 
From the sonograms to 
the weddings and breakups, Majeski and Daly have put together a collection of tidbits that give a frank representa-tion of life for teen moms, both on and off the screen. 
The 17 chapters of this 
book also include rather dis-heartening statistics about the young moms featured throughout the show. For example, 25 percent of the mothers have been arrested and 56 percent of their mar-riages have ended in di-vorce. 
But perhaps the most strik-
ing information unveiled in the book stems from conﬂ  icts shared between the cast and television show producers. For example, Kaitlyn Lowry said, “The scene where I tell [my boyfriend] Jordan about cheating on him was re-enacted. That’s why I was so coldhearted. There was a point that I wanted to quit and rip up my contract be-cause of the way they treated me.”
In circumstances like 
these, readers are invited to take a critical look at the con-struction of shows marketed as observations of reality. 
Heightened conﬂ  ict in-
creases ratings but at what expense? “Teen Mom Con-ﬁ  dential” makes it clear that sacriﬁ  ces must be made by adolescent parents, yet in this dramatic equation it seems as though the catalyst for the show’s premise is overlooked — the child.

The end is near. 
The epic story of the Wolf Pack ends this sum-
mer, and that’s why this week’s “What to Watch” movie is “The Hangover Part III.”
The trilogy, which is now in theater, has a new 
plot that will be a breath of fresh air for its audi-ence. Some fans complained that the plots of the ﬁ  rst and second movies were too similar. This time, the storyline in part three doesn’t revolve around a bachelor party or a wedding.
In the third ﬁ  lm, Alan, played 
by Zach Galiﬁ  anakis, has a midlife crisis after his father dies. The Wolf Pack sets out on a road trip to drop Alan off at a treatment facility. As always, mayhem and trouble follow these friends everywhere.
I’m not a fan of sequels because they can be-
come boring and tedious. “The Hangover” is an exception because it keeps me laughing for days. For months my friends and I would imitate our favorite quotes of the movie.
“You probably get this a lot. This isn’t the real 
Caesar’s Palace, is it?” Alan said in the ﬁ  rst mov-ie.
These “#Alanisms,” which are trending on 
Twitter, are sure to be the highlight of the trilogy.        
The movie also features stars new to “The 
Hangover” team, such as Melissa McCarthy from “Identity Theft” and John Goodman from the tele-vision series “Roseanne.”
New and old stars return for an enjoyable end-
ing to a hilarious comedy.What to Watch

Dear Mediocre Advice,
Is it unreasonable to want 
your girlfriend to limit pet names 
to you, people of her same sex and relatives? Obviously, there’s some leeway here, but using the same pet name on me and on an -
other male of the same general 
age feels pretty shitty.
Dear Friend,
Her use of pet names 
is generalizing you with some guy who isn’t her boyfriend. This may cause jealousy and insecurities. If she’s going to call you a pet name, it shouldn’t be used as a nickname for ev-ery guy she knows. Wheth-er it’s Doo-doo Face or Sugar D**k, you should get your own pet name or none at all. Pet names are an excuse for her to call you something other than your proper name and replace it with something she thinks sounds cute. Think about whatever pet name she calls you and ask yourself if you really want to be ad -
dressed as that. If it’s got anything to do with sweets or animals, I’d opt out. You are not a pet, you are her boyfriend, and she should treat you differently from other men.Dear Mediocre Advice,
How do I not smell like a 
turd after being outside for 5 
minutes in this hell weather?
Dear Friend,  
You will smell like a ba -
by’s used diaper at least 
once during the sweet sum -
mer of Florida. You can put on all the deodorant or per -
fume you want, but your nat-ural body odor will eventu -
ally leak and people will be offended. There is a way to avoid this undesirable situa-tion. The moment you think your body odor is getting out of control and someone is there to smell it, just run away. This trick is called Forrest Gumping — running away from an unwanted sit-uation. Forrest Gumping is not limited to running away when you don’t want people to smell your awful cat-poop body odor. This tactic can be used when you see an ex coming toward you or when someone is getting a little too clingy at a bar. It’s a shame -
ful tactic and it will definitely come back to haunt you, but I guarantee no one will be able to smell you if you run away from them.Dear Mediocre Advice,
I really want a dog, but I am 
still a full-time student and gone long hours most days. Should I hold off until I have a more stable living situation? Is a rescue dog really better off at a shelter than with a loving owner who just happens to not have the most ideal schedule for a pet?Dear Mediocre Advice,
What is the proper etiquette 
for getting the beer shits when you’re out at a club or bar? Hold it and hope you don’t ex -
plode, leave and run to a public restroom somewhere else, or just try to poop quickly in the crowded bathroom and pray no one ties the smell to you?
Dear Friend,
There are two things in 
this world that will defi -
nitely make me cry: the first ten minutes of UP and the bond between a hu -
man and a dog. It’s a kind of companionship so great you wonder how you ever lived without it. A dog in a loving home is better than in a cage accompanied by likely death. You wouldn’t be the first person to adopt a dog while swamped with school work. Even if you can’t dedicate that much time to a dog or you have a small apartment, it’s still better than a dog being stuck in a cage all day with limited play time. At some shelters, dogs are lucky if there are volunteers to take them out once a day. Try fostering a dog and if you think you can handle 
it — adopt!Dear Friend,
Here are a few advantages 
that a club or bar provides when you’re in such a sticky situation: loud music, the smell of liquor and smoke, and the fact that everyone is drunk. The loud music will cover up whatever unfortunate sounds that may resonate from your stall. The natural smell of a dirty club will cover up your dirty smell. Thanks to liquor — the one thing that keeps these clubs and bars in busi -
ness — maybe only one per -
son will tie the smell you left in the bathroom to you. Keep in mind that the people in line are not poop detectives trying to figure out who just took a dump. Nobody wants to know — or cares — who the cul -
prit is. Bathrooms are where we dispose human waste. If someone calls you out, tell them that it can’t always smell like roses in there. Beer shits only come out one way.
� COURSE REQUIRED 
REGARDLESS OF MAJOR.

Freshmen will need to make sure 
their schedules include “What is the 
Good Life” in upcoming semesters.
The interdisciplinary humanities 
class will be required for the second year in a row. Andrew Wolpert, hu-manities common course director, said the first year went well.
“It’s been a huge success devel-
oping this core curriculum,” Wolp-ert said.
He said about 6,800 freshmen 
are expected to enroll in “What is the Good Life” in the next academic year.
The 2012 Summer B term marked 
the first time UF mandated the course for incoming freshmen. The class poses philosophical questions to students and zooms in on the arts, religion and sustainability. Wolpert said that the student re-
sponse was mixed, and most nega-tive comments stemmed from the fact that the class is required.
John Maze, UF architecture pro-
fessor and an instructor of “What is the Good Life,” said the course pushes students out of their comfort zones.
“We try to expose you to as many 
viewpoints as possible,” he said.
Jillian Briceno, a 19-year-old UF 
biology sophomore, said the class differed from her usual science-heavy schedule.
“It is a way to broaden perspec-
tives, so I see why they have it,” Bri-ceno said.
Lisa Paper, a 20-year-old UF 
journalism sophomore, said she enjoyed the class, but the workload was heavy.
“There was too much reading 
each week,” Paper said. “I think it just overwhelmed people, so they didn’t want to read it.” 
The course was made manda-
tory by the University Curriculum Committee. About 6,300 students were enrolled in the class in Fall and Spring of the 2012-2013 school year.
Wolpert said he is looking to en-
hance the course by getting students more engaged and shrinking lecture class sizes. The goals of the require-ment were to unite freshmen and educate students about the humani-ties.
“It’s been an enormous learning 
experience,” Wolpert said. “We’re very pleased with how things went.”
“What is the Good Life” still required for incoming freshmen

Money. It burns a hole in your 
pocket. It is the root of all evil. 
And for some strange reason, you put it where your mouth is. You feel its rasp as you slide it between your index finger and thumb. You watch as the plastic skids perfectly through the card reader.  As college students, mon-ey is pivotal to us. Without it, we can’t attend school. No housing, no food, no going out to Karma Cream at 1 a.m to eat a medium-sized Mexican chocolate ice cream at $4.60 a pop and staring at sub-liminal artwork while question-ing your choice of major.
The truth is many students, 
including myself, have a hard time managing and budgeting our money so that we can pur-chase all the necessities we actu-ally need. Looking at your bank account at the end of the semes-ter — or even in the middle of it — can make you want to punch yourself. Don’t punch yourself: Get the Mint budgeting app.
Instead of keeping receipts in a shoe box or going online to check your transactions every day, you can download Mint on your smartphone and have your bank account viewable in an instant while simultaneously viewing where the money went (toward what “merchant,” as the app la-bels it). With the app, you can see how much money you wasted in the past month, coupled with an illustration of a type of cash meter that continually grows every time money is spent until it reaches full capacity, at which point you receive a phone alert.Think of it as 
the fluctuating ammo gauge in “Call of Duty,” which you spent 50 bucks on last week. By seeing 
the meter, you think twice about spending your money. With the app, you can program the maxi-mum amount you want to spend in a month for transit, food, shop-ping -- or any other category you wish to add -- and you receive advice and alerts if you’ve gone over your monthly budget.Handling your money in a 
responsible way is definitely a lot harder than it sounds. We’re constantly being encouraged to spend our money without giving a second thought to existing cou-pons or daily deals. Mint can even help you with that. By getting a sense of what “merchant” your money primarily goes to, Mint can provide coupons and handy tips to help you save a little bit. Why go through the long process of checking receipts when you’re an app away from becoming a thrifty connoisseur?
Budgeting for the typical college student: think then spendbest of the blogsTHURSDAY, MAY 23, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 15Vonecia Carswell / Avenue
Demetrick Williams, 6, sits in a military vehicle 
during the fourth annual Sweet Dreams “Touch-A-Truck.” This is his first time attending the event.VONECIA CARSWELL
Avenue Writer
Hundreds of dreams were brought to life Satur-
day at the fourth annual Sweet Dreams “Touch-A-
Truck.”
Horns honked as families walked through the 
maze of service vehicles on Citizens Field. The event provided children with a hands-on educational ex-perience, allowing them to climb into and onto any vehicle of their choice.
“This is fabulous,” TJ Mong, 8, said as he hopped 
on the laurel green Fish and Wildlife Conservation airboat.
“How does this work?” Andrew Dube, 3, asked 
a firefighter.
“He loves trucks,” Andrew’s father, Matt Dube, 
said. “It’s a good way for him to see the real thing and see how this equipment is used. And I want to give him a broader perspective on life.”
By midday, smoke filled the air and families rushed 
toward the white picnic tables where Gainesville firefighters grilled hot dogs and hamburgers.
Next to the condiments lay a firefighter boot in 
which they collected donations.
Proceeds benefit Camp Amigo, the Children’s 
Burn Camp of North Florida, which aims to build a network of support for children who have physical and emotional scars.
“This is a good chance for another few thousand 
people to know about us,” Rusty Roberts, Camp Amigo’s president and a Tallahassee firefighter, said.
Cassie Null, a 22-year-old burn survivor and 
Camp Amigo counselor, took a break from stuffing and distributing complimentary black and yellow tote bags to share her camp story.
“You know when you see someone who has the 
same shirt you have, you go, ‘Oh my gosh! I have that same shirt.’ Well, we’re like, ‘Oh my gosh! I have that same burn,’” Null said. “Yeah, it’s weird, but that’s how much we bond.”
Null was among the first group to attend Camp 
Amigo, and now she serves as a mentor.
“I got to get both sides,” she said. “I’m not here 
for me anymore, you know.”KATHLEEN BOYLE

Nick Ott, a 17-year-old high 
school student and employee of 
Orlando’s Kona Dog food truck, worked at a fast pace Saturday night in order to meet the needs of his hungry customers. He made the trip north to Gainesville with his co-workers and boss, owner and operator Doug Trovillion. Ott was diligent and upbeat as he described the delectable medley of toppings that characterize the menu’s quintessential Hula Dog — an “authentic Hawaiian-style hot dog.”
“The spicy jalapeno hula sauce, 
coconut sauce and pineapple mus-tard are really good together,” Ott explained to a first-time customer as he bathed the jumbo dog in a bevy of unconventional condi-ments.
Undeterred by the consistently 
long yet patient line that waited in front of this eatery on wheels, Ott was one of a number of em-ployees who populated the park-ing lot of High Dive on Saturday for Gainesville’s third Original Food Truck Rally. Hosted by Glory Days Presents!, High Dive and Pelican Brothers food trucks, this well-attended, all-ages event brought together a potpourri of cuisine representative of the vari-ous areas’ finest mobile culinary creations. In addition to Kona Dog, vendors included such carts as Humble Pie, Monsta Lobsta, the Grilled Cheese Wagon, Charlie’s Snow Shack, Off the Griddle, Go Go Stuff Yourself, Sizzle Wagon, and Pelican Brothers, a year-round presence of High Dive’s driveway that offers a platter that could sat-isfy even the pickiest of eaters. A live music and Grow Radio DJ se-lection enhanced the vibe, making the evening’s sounds, sights and smells a pleasurable assortment of sensory overload.
Robbie Regenhardt, a 27-year-
old UF medical student, had not attended one of the previous two rallies held at High Dive but was inspired by the entrepreneurial spirit that permeated throughout the affair. 
“I’ve always enjoyed support-
ing local businesses,” he said be-tween bites of the Hula Dog he was eating. “All of the trucks are different, and the food is great. It’s almost hard to believe that these chefs can create this kind of food in a kitchen that was once a UPS truck.”16, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, MAY 23, 2013

“Touch-A-Truck” raises awareness 
for burn victims and survivorsBROOKE PERRY

Catering to a population 
that spends just as much 
time watching television as they do working, sleeping and going to school, it is no surprise that online video sites have begun to charge users to stream their favorite shows and movies.
Recently, YouTube be-
gan launching 54 pay chan-nels ranging from children’s shows and stations dedicated to pet lovers, to LGBT enter-tainment and UFC fights.
These channels are sup-
plied by YouTube partners and are priced between 99 cents and $7.99 per month. The average channel cost is $2.99. Users may purchase a subscription per channel us-ing Google Wallet and enjoy a 14-day free-trial period. These channels are not all ad-free but at least 40 are.
“I think the prices are 
reasonable,” 19-year-old UF public relations sopho-more Calli Rudman, who uses YouTube most often to watch music videos and Net-flix for movies, said. “But I would like better to be able to hand pick a movie because it would be more specific to what I want.”
However, paying for the 
monthly subscription gets the viewer access to various exclusive films and episodes, depending on what the chan-nel delivers.
In an interview with the 
Associated Press, filmmaker Roger Corman talked about his rejection of Hulu and how he sees promise in YouTube. Corman’s channel will begin in June, showing a rotating selection of 30 of his past movies, as well as interviews about his new ones.
“I believed for many years 
that the future of motion pic-ture distribution, particu-larly for the independents, is on the Internet,” he said. “I think the time is now.”YouTube charges for 
use of 54 channels 
“I believed for many 
years that the future 
of motion picture 
distribution, particularly 
for the independents, 
is on the Internet,” he 
said. “I think the time is 
now.”

  Forward Will Yeguete underwent ar-
throscopic debridement on his right knee 
Wednesday morning at Shands, UF con-ﬁ  rmed.
  His recovery should take about four months, 
and he could return for the start of preseason practices. Arthroscopic debridement involves the removal of damaged cartilage or bone.
  “Surgery went well!Thank you for your 
thoughts&prayers I really appreciate it! An-other challenge has begun for me! #ComeBack #GoGators,” Yeguete posted on his Twitter account (@Will15Yeguete) Wednesday at 3:25 p.m.
  On Feb. 8, Yeguete underwent arthroscopic 
surgery to remove bone chips in his right knee. After the season, coach Billy Donovan called Yeguete’s ﬁ  rst surgery a “short-term ﬁ  x.”
  Yeguete missed six games and returned to 
the lineup March 2. During UF’s ﬁ  nal 10 con-tests, the 6-foot-7, 240-pound forward averaged 4.5 points and 4.8 rebounds in 18.9 minutes per game.
  He experienced swelling in his right knee

The Los Angeles Angels announced Tuesday that former Gators inﬁ  elder David Eckstein will represent the team at the MLB Draft on June 6. It’s time for Gators fans to face the 
facts. This year’s baseball team is not good.
  Sitting at 29-28 – the worst record 
for the baseball program since 2007 – and with its season possibly over, everyone can acknowledge that this team did not have what it took to win this year.
  The hitting wasn’t there, espe-
cially at the end. In their last eight games, the Gators averaged 3.4 runs per game. Those numbers include a three-game series against Georgia – the worst team in the SEC – where Florida only scored seven runs.
  Sluggers like Mike Zunino and 
Preston Tucker led last year’s team. But the MLB Draft took its toll on the Gators and sapped all of their pow-er.
  Catcher Taylor Gushue was sup-
posed to lead the Gators’ offense and replace some of the lost power, but he ﬁ  nished the year with ﬁ  ve hom-ers. That would have tied for sixth on last year’s team.
  Second base-
man Casey Tur-geon had a simi-lar season to his 2012 campaign 
that him named to Perfect Game’s Freshman All-American team. But this year he was expected to be a pre-mier player in the Gators’ offense, and a .269 average didn’t cut it.
  The pitching wasn’t where it need-
ed to be, either.
  Jonathon Crawford was supposed 
to be an ace. He had a great sopho-more season in 2012 that was high-lighted by a no-hitter – in the NCAA Regionals, no less.

  With a chance for the Southeastern Con-
ference title and a possible NCAA Tourna-
ment bid on the line, Florida needed someone to step up.
  No one did.  “We didn’t compete at the end,” assistant 
coach Brad Weitzel said. 
  Down by two runs late in the game, the 
Florida offense collapsed. Seven of the last eight batters struck out against Texas A&M’s starter Daniel Mengden, who sealed the Aggies’ (32-25, 15-16 SEC) 6-3 win over the Gators (29-28, 14-17 SEC) in Hoover, Ala., on Tuesday. 
  “I thought we pitched well enough … but 
we just weren’t able to do enough offensive-ly,” coach Kevin O’Sullivan said.
  Before the Gators’ offense shut down, it 
got out to an early lead against Mengden. 
  Right ﬁ  elder Justin Shafer got on base on 
an error by Aggies second baseman Blake Al-lemand and advanced to second on a balk. He made it to third on a wild pitch, and ﬁ  rst baseman Vickash Ramjit drove him in on a groundout.
  Florida got back-to-back hits from des-
ignated hitter Zack Powers and left ﬁ  elder Harrison Bader and executed a double steal to put both runners in scoring position. Cody Dent hit an inﬁ  eld single to score Powers, but Bader was thrown out at home trying to score from second.
  The Gators tacked on a third run after the Aggies took a 3-2 lead in the ﬁ  fth on a three-run homer by third baseman Hunter Melton. Florida third baseman Josh Tobias singled to start the inning and advanced to third on groundouts by Dent and Richie Martin. To-bias came around to score on a wild pitch. 
  But Florida’s offense ended there.  After second baseman Casey Turgeon 
walked in the ﬁ  fth inning, Florida did not get a man on base for the rest of the game. To-bias’ single was the last ball a Gator hit out of the inﬁ  eld.
  After giving up early runs, Mengden 
settled down and worked the Florida lineup. The sophomore right-hander struck out a career-best 11 batters and retired the last 13 hitters he faced.
    “I think he mixed it up pretty well,” Bad-
er said. “He threw a lot of different types of pitches for strikes.”
  While Mengden was sitting down Florida 
batters, the Gators did not get a similar per-formance from starter Johnny Magliozzi.
  The sophomore – making only his third 
start of the season – began the game strong, setting the Aggies down in order in the ﬁ  rst three innings. But Magliozzi surrendered ﬁ  ve runs in 6.2 innings of work and picked up his ﬁ  rst loss as a starter this season.
  “I thought I made one bad pitch,” Ma-
gliozzi said. “Other than that, I felt pretty good.”
  After being eliminated from the SEC Tour-
nament, Florida rests its postseason hopes on the NCAA Tournament selection committee. The Gators have not missed the NCAA Tour-nament since ﬁ  nishing 29-30 in 2007. 
  “Our RPI is really good,” O’Sullivan said. 
We’ve had our ups and downs, but we’ve had a lot of good weekends in between ... At the end of the day, it’s the committee’s deci-sion.”

  Lauren Embree’s list of collegiate accom-
plishments is nothing short of astound-ing. 
  She is more than simply one of the most 
successful women’s tennis players in program history; Embree deserves mentioning in con-versations discussing Florida’s best athletes, in any sport, of all time. 
  I’m talking the greats: Tebow, Wambach, 
Noah, Spurrier, and the rest. 
  That’s why Embree’s performance this 
week is nothing short of shocking.
  With the Gators in contention for their third 
consecutive national championship — Embree hand-delivered the previous two champion-ships with match-clinching victories against Stanford in 2011 and UCLA in 2012 — the ex-pectation was the nation’s No. 1 player would ﬁ  nish her storied career by riding off into the sunset with another piece of hardware. 
  But reality often scoffs at fairy-tale end-
ings.
  Florida fell into a 3-0 hole against Stanford 
in the semiﬁ  nals. The Gators battled back be-fore Alex Cercone lost in a three-set war of a match to end UF’s season. But the writing was on the wall when Embree walked off the court with her ﬁ  rst loss in an NCAA dual match. 
  Read that again: Embree walked off the court with her ﬁ  rst loss in an NCAA dual match. Before falling 6-0, 6-1 to No. 13 Nicole Gibbs on Monday, Embree had won all 15 of her matches in NCAA dual competition. 
  No surprise, but that stands as a program 
record. 
  During Embree’s four seasons — a career 
capped with the ITA naming her National Senior Player of the Year on Tuesday — UF never fell short of the semiﬁ  nals. . 
  Literally, with a few more breaks — or 
better bounces — the Gators could have won four straight titles and become nothing short of a dynasty. Instead, they will have to settle for two championships — still enough to be considered the most successful program at UF as of late.  
  Florida’s four-year run with Embree was 
nearly ﬂ  awless.   But it won’t be repeated, no matter how many blue-chip prospects coach Roland Thornqvist can convince to come try to recreate Embree’s magic.

Sophomore Casey Turgeon hits a pop fly to first base in the bottom of the eighth inning against Florida 
Gulf Coast on Feb. 22. Turgeon’s batting average fell from .281 in 2012 to .269 this season.
MLB Draft hurt lineup
currently sits at 4.03 – .90 higher 
than his final ERA last year.
The staff behind Crawford 
didn’t pick up the slack. Nine other pitchers made starts this season, some occasionally show-ing promise before suffering an injury or going back to the bull-pen. 
Florida struggled to get start-
ers past the middle innings, and many a box score had half a dozen names listed as Florida pitchers. 
The Gators’ lack of depth 
is not necessarily coach Kevin O’Sullivan’s fault. He lost the most talented group of upper-classmen Florida baseball has ever seen. Gone were nearly the entire offense, his two top starters and three best bullpen arms.
And the major leagues were 
not done pillaging his team. The Gators lost several top recruits in the draft, as well. 
Gatorade Player of the Year 
Lance McCullers Jr. was supposed to take the mound at McKethan Stadium this year, but the Hous-ton Astros took him 41st overall. He has a 1.72 ERA in Single-A this season.
Outfielder Jesse Winker signed 
to play at Florida, but went to the Cincinnati Reds 49th overall. He has batted .326 in the Reds’ sys-tem the last two years. 
The remnants of a good re-
cruiting class still benefited Flor-ida – freshmen Richie Martin and Harrison Bader were the only starters to hit .300 – but the spe-cial, once-in-a-class player wasn’t there.  
Assistant coach Brad Weitzel 
said after the game Tuesday that the Gators would be dangerous in an NCAA regional. 
Jockeying for a bid is all well 
and good, but saying that this team is dangerous to any de-cent college team is not true. The Gators aren’t dangerous, they’re just plain mediocre.

The outdoor track and field season 
isn’t a sprint – it’s a marathon.
Spanning roughly three months with 
meets scattered throughout, the key 
to having a successful season is to fin-ish strong. It’s a theme that’s evident in events like the men’s 10,000-meter.
Thanks to freshman Jimmy Clark, 
Florida has excelled in the men’s 10k this outdoor season.
Clark was named the Southeastern 
Conference’s Men’s Freshman Runner of the Year and a member of the All-Con-ference First Team.  
“It was nice winning,” Clark said. “It 
was a great surprise. It’s a great achieve-ment, but there’s still a lot of work to do.”
Clark’s production has shot up sig-
nificantly this outdoor season. After competing in two indoor seasons and one season running cross country, Clark never placed better than fourth in any in-dividual event. 
“I wasn’t eating the best,” Clark said. 
“With the help from coach (Paul) Span-gler and [nutritionist Kelsee Gomes], I was able to get on a good diet and I lost some weight. It’s really helped my run-ning so far.” 
Once outdoor season came around, so 
did Clark. He earned all of his personal bests this season, and he has won more than half of the events in which he has competed. His most recent victory came in the men’s 10k at the SEC Champion-ships in Columbia, Mo. 
“Coach Spangler’s done a great job 
with us this year,” Clark said. “He had confidence in our abilities heading into the meet. We wanted to run well, espe-cially in the 10k.”
Clark and the Gators now focus on 
the season’s penultimate meet – the NCAA East Preliminary Rounds at North Carolina A&T State University in Greensboro, N.C.
The top 12 finishers in each individual 
event and top six finishers in each relay event at the preliminaries advance to the NCAA Outdoor Championships in Eu-gene, Ore.  
Florida has 48 athletes (22 men, 26 
women) competing in 29 events. The Gators are currently the top seed in seven events in the East region: both the men’s and women’s 4x400m relay squads, sophomore Ciarra Brewer in the women’s triple jump, senior and NCAA-leader Omar Craddock in the men’s triple jump, junior Cory McGee in the women’s 1,500 meters, freshman Marija Vucenovic in the women’s javelin throw and senior Ugonna Ndu in the women’s 400-meter hurdles.
Ndu, who is also running in the wom-
en’s 100-meter hurdles, is one of five ath-letes competing in multiple individual events in Greensboro this weekend. The others are junior Darshay Davis in the women’s 100 and 200 meters, sophomore Marquis Dendy in the men’s long jump and triple jump, junior Lorraine Graham in the women’s 100-meter hurdles and long jump and junior Agata Strausa in the women’s 1,500- and 5,000-meter.
Florida’s men hope to repeat after 
last year’s finish as 2012 NCAA Outdoor Champions – the only time the school has garnered the title.
“We’re just coming in confident,” 
Clark said. “As a team, we have much bigger goals than just getting to nation-als. We want a national title back in Gainesville. Everyone on the team is real focused. We’re looking to do big things out in Eugene.”
Added Clark: “We want to get as 
many people as we can out to Eugene so we can score some big points at nation-als.”

When Taylore Fuller arrived at Florida, 
the expectations were high.
Fuller joined UF as the No. 38 overall 
player and No. 6 catcher in the Class of 2012, 
according to ESPN. At Chiefland High, Full-er posted a .778 batting average and recorded 14 home runs, nine doubles, six triples and 33 RBI during her senior year. 
The Trenton native was named the 2012 
Florida Dairy Farmers Class 1A Player of the Year, among other accolades.
Through her first 59 games as a Gator, 
Fuller did not meet the sky-high expectations as a hitter. As of May 11, Fuller was batting .175 at the plate and had tallied 16 hits – three doubles, and two home runs for 14 RBI.
But during last weekend’s Gainesville Re-
gional, Fuller erupted. 
The freshman doubled her home-run to-
tal for the year, knocking both of her solo blasts during Florida’s first two days of ac-tion against Hampton and USF. Fuller went 3 of 6 with three RBI and two walks for the weekend, 
“I really had nothing to lose,” Fuller said. In the fifth inning against Hampton on 
Friday, Fuller homered to left field, increas-ing Florida’s advantage to 6-1 and putting the contest out of reach for the Pirates.
Against USF ace Sara Nevins on Saturday, Fuller led off the second with a solo homer to center. It was only Nevins’ sixth allowed this year. 
The Gators went on to score four more 
runs in the inning for an 8-1 lead. 
Facing Bulls reliever Sam Greiner in the 
third, Fuller began the inning with a double that bounced off the left-center field fence.
“I’ve been seeing the ball really well,” 
Fuller said. “My timing is finally coming to-gether for me. But just being able to produce for my team finally feels really good. They all get really excited for me.”
Fuller was also 
hit by a Nevins pitch with the bases loaded on Sunday, scoring a 
run to give UF a 2-0 lead.
With a Super Regional matchup looming 
against Alabama-Birmingham (40-17) on Sat-urday at 1 at Katie Seashole Pressly Stadium, Fuller hopes to continue her recent hitting success.
She is one of 13 players for No. 2 seed 
Florida (55-7) who have never competed in a Super Regional.  
“We’re playing her for those moments,” 
coach Tim Walton said. “We want more home runs and doubles from her ... She can put a little bit of sock … at the end of the lineup.

It was a new day on the golf 
course, but much of the same on the 
scorecard for Florida in the second round of competition at the NCAA Championships. 
The Gators slid further down 
the leaderboard Wednesday after only improving by one shot from their first-round performance of 299 (+11). Florida’s five golfers shot a 298 (+10), finshing in 19th on Wednesday. 
Their two-round score of 597 
(+21) put them 37 shots behind first-place USC midway through compe-tition.Freshman Ursa Orehek was a 
bright spot for the Gators, but her round got off to a rough start.
Orehek bogeyed her first hole 
and double-bogeyed her third. She recovered with four birdies against only two bogeys in her 15 remaining holes to end the day with a 73 (+1), the best performance for Florida by two strokes. 
“I’m happy with the way Ursa 
played,” coach Emily Bastel said in a release. “She hung pretty tough after a slow start. Overall, we had it going for a few stretches. We just haven’t quite been able to put it to-gether for an entire day, and that’s what we’ll be trying to do for the next couple of days and keep mov-ing up.”
Senior Mia Piccio and sopho-
more Camilla Hedberg again matched each others’ scores, but the results were two shots worse than their first round as both women carded two of Florida’s three 75 (+3) rounds on the day.
Piccio’s consistency in her first 
round – which included 12 straight pars – did not carry over to Round 2. The senior had three bogeys on the front nine and a double bogey on hole 15. Picco’s saving graces was bookending birdies on holes 10 and 18 of the back nine. 
Hedberg’s day ended poorly af-ter playing 15 holes at either even par or one over. She bogeyed two of the last three holes to finish at 75 (+3). 
Junior Elcin 
Ulu, who was the 
most consistent Gator in the sec-ond round, shot the other 75. Af-ter three straight bogeys on holes No. 2, 3 and 4, Ulu navigated 
the rest of the course without error, parring the remaining 14 holes. 
Sophomore Anna Young had 
another bogey-filled scorecard – finishing with seven bogeys and a double bogey as well. Her three redeeming birdies – two of which came on an inconsistent stretch that included three bogeys – were only good enough to score a 78 (+6). She had only one birdie in her first round.
“We’ve gotten some momentum 
going, but then something will hap-pen that kills it,” Bastel said. 
“This golf course will do that to 
you. It requires a lot of patience, but there are some unforced errors, too. It’s not so much we need them to hit perfect shots every time, but your misses have to be smart. That’s the sign of a good player.”
