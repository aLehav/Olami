Students, SG take sides over expansion fee
USF, FSU have enacted similar fees
By CAROLYN TILLO
Alligator Staff Writer
At the Reitz Union students can
gather together, but discussions of
a proposed student fee to fund its
renovation, repairs and expansion
are dividing students and Student
Government senators.
The proposed fee would includea $20 flat fee for each student in ad-
dition to a $3 fee per credit hour, ac-
cording to Student Body President
Jordan Johnson. He said the estimat-
ed cost of the renovation and expan-
sion would be about $70 million to
$80 million.
About $56 million would come
from student fees, while the remain-
der would be paid through Capi-tal Improvement Trust Funds and
alumni donations, Johnson said.
Out of the $56 million from stu-
dent fees, about $42.5 million would
help fund Reitz Union repairs while
the remainder would fund the ex-
pansion, Johnson said.
Some suggestions for the renova-
tion and expansion include making
the building Leadership in Energyand Environmental Design certified,
expanding student organization
space and adding a 1,500-seat the-
ater for dances and events, accord-
ing to a presentation by Johnson.
Johnson said other state schools,
including University of South Flor-
ida and Florida State University,
have used a similar student fee to
fund their student unions.
Eddie Daniels, the executive
director of the Reitz Union, said
repairs are necessary regardless ofhow they are funded.
He said the Reitz Union requires
$42.5 million over the next 15 years
for repairs involving air handling
units, plumbing and electrical sys-
tems.
Daniels said architects met with
students, organizations, faculty and
staff Nov. 2 through Nov. 5 to take
suggestions about what they would
like to see added to the union, but

Improve group will
compete in Chicago
By NICOLE LYNN GREINER
Alligator Contributing Writer
Theatre Strike Force doesn't need
scripts to get a laugh.
About 250 people attended the
group's performance of "Unscript-
ed" Wednesday. The show was a
celebration of the group's first-place
win in the southeastern regional
round of the third annual College
Improve Tournament.
Another performance of "Un-
scripted" will be held today at 9 p.m.
in the Reitz Union Rion Ballroom.
The tournament took place in
Atlanta on Saturday. Theatre Strike
Force sent five of its members,
known as the Sunday Group, to
compete against eight other south-
eastern colleges. The group will go
to Chicago for the tournament finals
on Feb. 6.
"I want a national champion-
ship for UF in improv," said Jennifer
Francis, a senior telecommunicationmajor and member of Theatre Strike
Force.
In the competition, the group
performed two 25-minute improvi-
sation sessions. The group won the
first session and went to the final
round.
Last year the Sunday Group
placed second in the regional
round.
Saturday's performance was
similar to the show "Unscripted."
The show includes a cast of nine
members, three of whom were also
members of the Sunday Group.
Guest speakers in "Unscripted"
were asked random questions about
their lives, experiences and dreams.
Among the speakers were en-
tomology professor Carl Barfield,
former UF track star and Olympic
gold medalist Bernard Williams,
and Student Body President Jordan
Johnson.
The show was sponsored by The-
atre Strike Force, Reitz Union Board
Entertainment and SG.

Santa Fe College students create amateur fight club
0 MEMBERSHIP IN THE
CLUB IS FREE.
By JOHN J. BOOTHE
Alligator Contributing Writer
The first rule about fight club is
you do talk about fight club.
As mixed martial arts -MMA
-continues its fight to become
America's No. 1 televised violence
supplier, so does the desire of its
viewers to learn the secrets and
techniques behind every guillotine
choke and armbar submission.But the increase in popularity
also comes with an increase in de-
mand for training.
So, two Santa Fe Community
College students are offering an af-
fordable training price for even the
tightest budget: free.
Amateur kickboxers Trey Tuck-
er, 20, and Jarrod Carmody, 19,
started Gainesville Fight Club as
a way to teach each others MMA
style combat in between their full-
time school and work schedules.
The two of them meet several times
a week in Carmody's garage where
Tucker has $500 worth of mats,gloves, bags and Thai pads.
Both fighters describe the club
as a cooperative, where each fight-
er contributes something, whether
it is equipment or training tech-
niques, to the group.
"If you're poor, we don't care,"
Tucker said. "Come
Local in, man. You can use
News our gloves, and we
can work something
out. We can do car washes or sell
GFC T-shirts. The whole point is to
show there are other ways to do this
than having to charge money."
Tucker said his training suitsthe college lifestyle more than a
professional system. Most profes-
sional training is geared for people
who want to make a career out of
MMA.
Jason Dolder, head trainer of
the F2 Fight Team in Gainesville,
said that while it's admirable that
Gainesville Fight Club is trying to
offer free MMA training, his gym is
far from ripping people off.
"There's a reason why you pay
professionals to teach you this
stuff," he said.
F2 Fight Team offers training
for $55 a month, which, accordingto Dolder, is very affordable when
compared with other MMA gyms.
Tucker thinks that even though
he and Carmody are relatively new
to MMA -their first organized
fights in the discipline will be Jan-
uary -the training necessary to
start out isn't complicated.
Ninety percent of MMA train-
ing is relatively simple, he said. For
the other 10 percent, such as Brazil-
ian Jiu-Jitsu and boxing technique,
he said the group will pitch in
money to hire a professional to lay
the groundwork for that month's
training.

Group calls for 'Vagina' roles
Auditions continue tonight

Alicia Marie Rodriguez, an advertising and theater major, auditions for "The Va-
gina Monologues" in the basement of the Reitz Union on Tuesday night.By JULIE UNGER
Alligator Contributing Writer
When she was 11 years
old, Lorraine Wheat stood
in the middle of a bookstore
and said, "Guess what, Mom.
My vagina is angry."
Wheat's mother was famil-
iar with the book her daugh-
ter was imitating and calmly
explained to her daughter a
little bit about the play.
Eight years later, Wheat
once again announced that
her vagina was angry -this
time during a play called
"The Vagina Monologues"
by Eve Ensler.
This year, Victory Over
Violence, a UF anti-domestic
violence organization, will
put on its fourth annual
production of "The Vagina
Monologues" as a fundraiser
for organizations like local
domestic violence victim
shelter Peaceful Paths.
"Any woman who wants
to be proactive and to fight
for human rights, who wants
to do great things, wants to
be like [Ensler]," said Wheat,
an advertising senior and
Victory Over Violence publicrelations officer at UF.
Auditions for the 2010
performance began on Tues-
day and will continue from
8:30 p.m. to 10 p.m. tonight
in the Reitz Union basement,
Room 60.
"I don't think this is
something you can get
involved in and it not
become your heart."
Lorraine Wheat
UF student
Twenty-eight women au-
ditioned Tuesday, and more
are expected to audition to-
night.
"There are 33 mono-
logues, and we offer anyone
that auditions that doesn't
get a monologue a spot in
public relations, advertising
or something else so they can
still be involved in the pro-
duction," said Jenna Calton,
Victory Over Violence presi-
dent and a psychology junior
at UF.
During the 2008-2009 fis-
cal year, Peaceful Paths pro-
vided services for 1,260 newclients, helped house 128
adults and 90 children and
provided 11,701 services, ac-
cording to the Peaceful Paths
2009 fact sheet.
The monologues deal
with the pain and shame that
women face, whether it's be-
cause of their bodies, experi-
ences or surviving abuse.
"Eve Ensler uses the work
to inspire a grassroots move-
ment which started anti-vi-
olence and abuse networks.
Vday.org showcases all of
the movements and all of
the things they're doing. It
shows that she's using her
work and art to give women
who wouldn't be able to ex-
press themselves a medium
to talk about their pain,"
Wheat said.
She added that her part in
the play inspired deep con-
versations with women who
sought her out afterward to
say they wished they could
express themselves.
"After you do this play
you feel, 'Why not? Why
should I feel ashamed for be-
ing a woman?"' Wheat said.
"I don't think this is some-
thing you can get involved
in and it not become your
heart."

design drawings based on these
needs will not be available until Feb-
ruary.
He said some suggestions in-
cluded adding more student orga-
nization office space, more perform-
ing space and more meeting rooms.
Daniels said UF has outgrown the
union.
"So, my hope is we'll be able to
somehow get a facility that will bet-
ter meet the needs of our current
student population," Daniels said.
Senators passed a resolution sup-
porting the Reitz Union expansion
and student fee at Tuesday night'sSenate meeting.
But some senators and graduate
students at the meeting said stu-
dents should have a chance to vote
on the student fee in the spring SG
elections.
Orange and Blue Party Sen. Jon
Ossip said he was not
On against the fee or the
expansion but wanted
to make sure the ma-
jority of students approved of the
ideas.
"I would support whatever the
students choose on the ballot," Os-
sip said.
But according to Johnson, hav-
ing students vote on the fee woulddelay its journey to the Florida leg-
islature and Gov. Charlie Crist, who
would ultimately decide whether it
would be put into effect. If it were
approved, Johnson said UF would
then lobby for capital improvement
trust funds and private donations as
well.
He said about 1,500 students
have signed a petition supporting
the expansion. In addition, about
3,600 students were surveyed, and
Johnson said he plans to have a town
hall forum in early December to con-
tinue discussions with students.

expected to .take any possible indication that something is
out of order very seriously, and that's what the chair did,"
D'Anieri said.
"I actually don't think it's that big a deal," he said of clos-
ing the office. "I don't think it caused a big disruption and if
it helped people feel better, then that's fine."
Conley's lawyer, Thomas Edwards, said
the closure of the office was unwarranted.
Edwards said Conley had made no threats
to anyone at UF and that the closing was
likely influenced by a strained relationship
between Conley and Craig.
"There was no connection between
what took place between he and his wife
and the department chair closing down theConley department," he said.
He said the reference to past violent threats in Craig's e-
mail likely alluded to allegations made by Conley's ex-wife
during divorce proceedings that began in 2006.
According to Edwards, the allegations, which Conley said
are untrue, were made to gain leverage in a custody battle.
Craig referred comment to UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes,
who said her ability to comment was limited because the is-
sue was a personnel matter.

Fee-for-All
SG should get student
input on new Reitz fee
uesday's Student Government vote on the proposed Re-
itz Union expansion has stirred up almost as much inter-
est (and as many impassioned letters and Web site com-
ments) as SG's pending decision on a resolution denouncing the
Goldstone report, the controversial UN report alleging Israeli
war crimes.
For those of you somehow not already offended by the Al-
ligator's coverage of this report -and we know there must be a
few of you left out there -look to future issues.
But this week, rather than grandiose matters of war and
peace in the Middle East, SG tackled a subject that it may actu-
ally hold some influence over. unfortunately.
This resolution, which supports a student fee for the renova-
tion and expansion of the Reitz Union (and effectively endorses
the expansion itself), passed 67- 10, despite fierce debate.
The fact that letters to the Alligator describe this debate as
"grad-student whining" underscores how differently some
parties view the proposed fees. A $20 dollar flat fee plus $3
per credit hour might sound like chump change. But if it does,
you're likely not one of about 75 students who appeared to
voice concerns about rising student fees.
These whiners, many of whom are grad students without
Bright Futures or Florida Prepaid to help ease costs, pay signifi-
cant amounts out of pocket toward student fees. One graduate
assistant in the English department says her student fees ac-
count for up to 10 percent of her salary.
Another $100 dollars a year might not mean much for SG
senators or persistent, anonymous letter writers, but to some-
one on a razor thin budget, it can make a difference.
The fact that SG is voting on how to pay for a renovation and
expansion before it determines whether the Student Body even
wants -or needs -these changes leaves us with the same look
of shock and bewilderment that uninformed students will have
if slapped with new fees.
SG members cite a petition signed by 1,500 students as evi-
dence that UF wants (and needs?) a new and improved Reitz
Union. We can picture how that went down almost like we
were badgered outside of Library West ourselves: grand prom-
ises without a complete explanation of the financial impact on
all students.
As for the argument that student organizations desperately
need more office and meeting space, we still wonder how the
empty halls and meeting rooms that make the Reitz look like
a ghost town factor into SG's assessment. If the Reitz wants to
"better meet the needs of our current student population," as
its executive director Eddie Daniels described the expansion's
goal, why not first focus on making maximum use of the cur-
rent facilities.
UF can accomplish this goal by involving students (other
than a few SG members) in the process, receiving feedback
along the way to make better informed decisions. Daniels said
that architects tasked with planning the proposed expansion
met with students, organizations, faculty and staff earlier this
month; we wonder what limited group of students these archi-
tects met with. We didn't receive an invitation. (Go figure.)
UF and SG's lack of transparency in planning Reitz changes
merely aggravates all of these issues. Student fees, determining
critical needs. whether changes are necessary at all; we need
public discussion on these key points.
UF is a learning institution; it is ironic that we simultaneous-
ly cut dozens of faculty and staff members while constructing
new and possibly unnecessary buildings. Students need a voice
in this decision, especially if millions of dollars are involved.
Fortunately this resolution does not take any ac Lion. It mere-
ly reflects the opinion of the Senate. We're not quite sure that it
reflects the opinion of the UF Student Body, though.

MJ, C --
P ray fo r l ess for tun ate at Th an ksgiving
hile driving Oprah to her highest ratings in twoyears, Sarah Palin asked that we cast aside our
petty sociopolitical differences and as a united
country pray for the everliving soul of Levi Johnston.
Pray for Levi.
While my main gripe with Sarah Palin is her wanton dis-
regard for the tradition of giving children sensible names,
her advocacy of Levi Johnston as worthy of prayerful wor-
ship seems a negligent reading of Heavenly duties. Prayers
showered upon the healthy, virile white teenager swim-
ming in pistachio money surely fall upon deaf ears.
Perhaps she is emboldened by a reading of some more
vengeful God, more of an Old Testament deity. This God
surely would read our prayers as time to test the faith of
young Levi and arrange a severe comeuppance full of
wrath and afflictions.
This same God has infected the mind of Goldman Sachs
Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein, who in a long
London Times interview snidely remarked that earth-shat-
teringly horrible banking of the last derivative decade is
"God's work."
Pray for Levi. Pray for Lloyd, too.
Pray that we get some follow-through of good Ole' Tes-
tament rocket sauce from these mournful missives. Lloyd
and his like-minded accomplices surely do their bidding
tempting the good graces of Genesis god, a holy figure
always ready with a good hard smiting. Some bloodfire,
maybe a few public stonings -our prayers do not ask for
much.
We should keep optimism up that our prayers shall not
be in vain once sent to the correct sacred source. Based on
their conscienceless money grubbing, our economy got cir-
cumsized last fall with no anesthesia. Old Testament Godmust appreciate this surprise bris
and may recognize our rightfully
embattled banking sector as true be-
lievers.
Americans were certainly com-
plicit in conjuring up the subprime
Tommy Ma pie bomb that inflated our net worth and
letters@alligator org our sense of ideological impervious-
ness, but the capitalist class raging
out ahead of us deserves scorn and scrutiny for this nuclear
economic winter. We fought the battles and lost much of
our livelihoods, but they seem to have somehow won the
war and rocketed off in a billion-dollar escape pod.
Pray for Lloyd. Don't forget to pray for Levi, though.
I prayed for Britney back in the day, and she got through
her bald tribulations relatively unscathed. Britney Spears is
a hard-working girl who loved that spotlight so badly that
she sacrificed a few sham marriages to the fame game. Levi
may not be able to sing as of now, but even the least-accom-
plished fame whore knows a good vocal coach.
My own prayers for Levi are centered around his inevi-
table marriage to Britney Spears and the creation of a band
starring his kids and Britney's kids. Made for MTV and the
accompanying decades of televised group therapy, this su-
perband could single-handedly rewrite the scale for total
awesomeness.
Levi won't stop at just one illegitimate child, mind you
-but the Partridge family wasn't created in a day. Be pa-
tient, my fellow terrestrial transgressors, and just send your
prayers out to Lloyd and Levi this Thanksgiving.
Pray for Levi.

Senators disregarded students' wishes
I'd like to express my utter disgust at the
student senators who completely disregard-
ed their student constituents last night. More
than 70 students attended the Senate meeting
in opposition of a resolution that would sup-
port UF administration charging all students
a fee for the expansion and renovation of
the Reitz Union. Majority party senators ap-
proved this bill while simultaneously reject-
ing a proposed amendment that would bring
it to a Student Body referendum. It is under-
stood that the repairs are necessary. The ex-
pansion, however, is debatable pork.
Although the majority party senators
were quick to vote for this resolution, they
were not so quick to provide us with concrete
estimates of the costs students would have to
shoulder.
In fact, many of the estimates completely
ignored the additional millions of dollars in
costs that would be the responsibility of the
Student Body (more than $120 million). Yes,
everybody wants the luxury of a beautiful
union, but should it be at the expense of other
students' groceries, gas and ability to contin-
ue their education at UF? With such a con-
troversial issue, students should have spoken
out, and they did -only to be told their opin-
ion was irrelevant. Instead of participating in
debate, most senators were busy texting on
their BlackBerrys and iPhones. Senators, it
would be nice if you considered the people
who originally gave you authority.

Reitz Union needs renovations
The Alligator never seems to disappoint.
Wednesday's article "Senate approves Reitz
Union student expansion fee" left out some
important facts in the case for the Reitz Union
renovation and expansion. For instance, a pe-
tition was signed by about 1,500 students in
less than 24 hours in support of the renova-
tion and the student fee to pay for it. That
would seem to outweigh the 70 or so gradu-
ate students who attended Tuesday night's
Senate meeting.
The Reitz Union is in dire need of reno-
vation and expansion. It was built in 1967for 19,000 students, and UF now has more
than 50,000. Many of the systems, including
the electrical and air conditioning systems,
are original to the building's construction. If
those systems fail there is not nearly enough
money in reserve to fix even one of them.
Not to mention the asbestos in the walls
and ceilings and the energy inefficiencies of
the 1960s-era equipment. If we delay further,
the cost of the project will increase, leading to
a further increase in the student fee.
This would place even more of a burden
on students, undergraduate and graduate
alike. The question has never been should we
renovate and expand the Reitz Union, it's just
when. That time is now.
Severin Waistad
UF freshman and Springs Area Senator
Current students won't see benefits of
Reitz Union expansion, renovation
The Student Senate should not have ap-
proved the resolution favoring the imple-
mentation of a new fee to pay for the pro-
posed expansion of the Reitz Union.
The proposed fees would (I believe) take
effect before the completion of renovation of
the Reitz Union. Few, if any, current UF stu-
dents would still be here when the renova-
tion is complete, yet we would not only have
to put up with the inconvenience of dealing
with the construction work on the union, but
also have to pay fees for a renovation that
doesn't benefit us. I frequently attend the free
movies at the union (yea, RUB).
There might be a period where we have
to go without free movies while the cinema
is renovated -and Senate wants us to pay
a fee for that inconvenience. Eating at the
food court will be more difficult while the
renovation takes place -and Senate wants
us to pay a fee for that inconvenience. If the
union must be renovated, and if the renova-
tion must be paid for with student fees, then
those fees should not be implemented until
the renovation is complete. The students who
actually get to enjoy the (supposed) benefits
of the expanded union should be the ones to
pay for it.
Finally, I don't even think the union needs
to be expanded. I can see that the asbestosneeds to be removed. By all means, please
remove the asbestos from the union. That
shouldn't cost enough to warrant a new fee,
though. The Senate bill repeatedly mentions
UF's more than 900 student organizations,
many of which do not have office space in the
union.
But how many of them really need office
space? I've held three different officer posi-
tions in the Linguistics Society in my time at
UF, and we have never had or needed any
office space. I can say confidently that no
more than 10 percent -and quite possibly
no more than 5 percent -of UF's student or-
ganizations would actually use office space.
I say, just remove the asbestos and leave the
rest of the union as it is.
Zoe Ziliak
UF PhD candidate in linguistics
Renovations will improve quality of UF
In response to the expansion and renova-
tion of the Reitz Union, I would like to ex-
press support, despite the objections raised
concerning extra fees. Another beautiful and
utilitarian building on the UF campus further
fortifies the quality and progress that distin-
guishes Florida from other higher learning
institutions.
In a true Burkean sense, the pride and use-
fulness from the expansion will far outweigh
the cost. So while we may be a bit lighter in
the pocket, we will have another quality ad-
dition to our already noble campus. Florida's
rise to a premier university has always had
costs. This is no different.

US efforts against terrorism are war
This is in response to Wednesday's letter
to the editor "'War on terror' not a war." I
must disagree with Patrick Poage's position
that calling our "global effort to eliminate ter-
rorists" a war allows al-Qaida and others to
justify their actions against our country and
our soldiers.
Poage, like many others, seems to have
forgotten the terrorist attacks happened priorto our terming of the effort to prevent them a
"war." In the cases of the 1993 World Trade
Center bombing, the bombing of the U.SS.
Cole and the Sept. 11 attacks, among other
incidents, the terrorists didn't wait for us to
"justify" them before attacking us.
Poage also noted that the Obama adminis-
tration dropped the term "war on terror." In
response, I ask: If our leaders are unwilling to
use strong language to describe this "global
effort," how can we assume that they will
take strong action to succeed in this conflict?

Preachers shouldn't mask messages
This morning, while I strolled through
Turlington Plaza, I was delighted to see that
people were handing out copies of "The
Origin of Species" by Charles Darwin. This
seemed a vast improvement over coupons
and fliers. Then I opened the book and found
the "special introduction" urging me to ac-
cept an intelligent designer and "receive the
gift of eternal life."
Like any article wishing to spread doubt,
it did not state its true intentions up front.
Gradually, selective quotations were used
and unscientific (but reasonable-sounding)
arguments were made against evolution un-
til the reader reached the Living Waters' true
message: Jesus.
Evolution is a fascinating process that ties
together and enforces every biology course
I've taken at UF. As it says on a door in Bar-
tram Hall, it's very gradual change that you
can believe in. I urge any students genuinely
interested in evolution to either ignore the
slander against Darwin and evolution or,
even better, to find out for themselves.
This isn't a matter of Christianity versus
evolution, as if people can't believe both.
It's possible. However, if you're going to
try to convert people, Ray Comfort, you
shouldn't hide your religious tract behind a
book praised by scientists all over the world.
Preach out in the open or don't preach at all.

MtvU Woodie Awards recognizes popular, new artists
By ALEX ORLANDO
avenue writer
What does ittake to gain Woodie
status?
Bands will compete at the 2009
mtvU Woodie Awards, a showcase
of performers made popular on
college campuses. Performers will
include Asher Roth, Death Cab for
Cutie, Matt and Kim, The Dead
Weather and 30H!3 this year.
The awards show, now in its
sixth year, aired live Wednesday at
the Roseland Ballroom and will air
on MTV on Dec. 4 at 10 p.m. EST.
The Avenue participated in a col-
lege conference call on Nov. 10 with
artists who are nominated for the
award.
"We think it's a way for us to
call our artists that are having a
huge impact in college campuses
and respond to the attention thatthe artists are getting from the col-
lege audience," said Eric Conte, the
executive producer of the Woodie
Awards, during the conference call.
Conte also said he sees college
audiences as a "crystal ball as far
as music prediction."
Bands such as Fall Out Boy and
The Academy Is have been nomi-
nated for Woodies in years past, on
their way to larger crowds and more
recognition. Newer musicians note
the Woodies as a landmark on their
music careers.
"It's really been a journey," said
Asher Roth, known on college cam-
puses for his song "I Love College."
"Being nominated for Woodie of the
Year-it's really kind of remarkable
to see and step back and watch it
all happen."
Some of the artists say putting
on a better live show has helped
them gain a solid college fan base."We try to adjust the show and
make it a little bit more epic for a
bigger crowd and have fun in differ-
ent ways," said Nathaniel Motte of
30H!3, nominated for Best Perform-
ing Woodie.
"It's really been a journey.
Being nominated for Woodie
of tha 9 zar-it's really kind of
remarkable to see and step
back and watch it all happen."
ASHER ROTH
musician
Other artists attribute their stun-
ning and relatable videos to their
success on college campuses.
"It's more about everybody, you
know?" said Roth, who noted the
importance of relating to all crowds
on campus with his music."I think it forces you to think a
little harder," said Matt Johnson,
of Matt and Kim, who said he had
to beg his bandmate, Kim Schifino,
to appear naked with him in Times
Square to shoot a music video for
their song "Lessons Learned." The
video is nominated for Best Video
Woodie this year.
The video is relevant to college
students who are generally "more
open to doing wild things" at that
time of their lives, according to
Johnson, who refers to American
colleges as "communities of taste."
Matt and Kim will likely be per-
forming a clothed version of "Les-
sons Learned" at the Woodies.
Other performers include The Dead
Weather, also up for Best Video
Woodie, and Death Cab For Cutie.
Death Cab For Cutie is scheduled
to perform "Meet Me on the Equi-
nox" at the Woodies, which appearson the "New Moon" soundtrack.
The Dead Weather has not released
which song they will perform.
However, the Woodies are not
meant to be a "march to the main-
stream," Conte said.
Still, Conte said he doesn't think
artists should limit themselves just
to stay out of the limelight.
"[The artists] want to continue
making music for themselves," he
said. "As long as there's an appre-
ciation going back and forth, I think
that's what the ultimate goal is for
someone."
Even artists who have gained
mainstream recognition see the
Woodies as an easier alternative to
winning the music industry's more
prestigious awards.
"Tony Bennett wins Grammys,"
said Chris Walla, guitarist for Death
Cab For Cutie. "It just doesn't seem
like it's our job to win Grammys."
Hawthorne
Heights reborn
By NICOLE LA HOZ
avenue writer
The members of Hawthorne Heights have always been
driven to form a solid band. It doesn't stem from a hunger
for success, though. To the Dayton, Ohio, rock band, playing
music is a therapeutic escape.
While the band battled lawsuits and countersuits with Vic-
tory Records Inc., the ultimate tragedy struck them in 2007:
Guitarist and longtime friend Casey Calvert was found dead
on the band's tour bus from accidental mixture of prescribed
medication.
"The one thing that got us through was music," drummer
Eron Bucciarelli said. "That was the one thing that wasn't
dependent on waiting on a lawyer's phone call or anything
else."
The band members penned down thoughts, strummed
out emotions and pounded out troubles. Bucciarelli said mu-
sic "was one sort of safe place we could all go and meet up."
Through instrumental remedy, Hawthorne Heights rose
above its adversities. "Skeletons" is the fourth release from
the band due early next year.
During the Never Sleep Again Tour,
Hawthorne Heights will stop at Common
Grounds on Nov. 22 with Just Surrender,
Punchline, Monty Are I and Night Beast.
Tickets are $13 in advance and $15 the
day of. Doors open at 6 p.m.
The band sees smaller venues as a re-
vival because fans get a chance to recon-
nect with members as they preview the album. The shows
on Never Sleep Again are "way more intimate" and consist of
high energy performance from every band, ideal for fans who
haven't seen them live in four to six years, Bucciarelli said.
"This is all new to us again. It's great," he said.
"Skeletons" places the band in a delicate predicament,
however. While its 2004 platinum debut, "The Silence in Black
and White," and follow-up success, "If Only You Were Lonely,"
boom with catchy screamo rock tracks, lastyear's "Fragile Fu-
ture" was Hawthorne Heights' outlet for dealingwith Calvert's
passing. The sudden reconciliation with Victory Records led to
a rushed release, and many fans were unaware of it.
Bucciarelli said he and the band worry about "die-hard"
fans' reactions to "Skeletons." Their tastes and influences
might have changed since "If Only You Were Lonely," he said.
"To maintain relevance you have to continuously evolve
and change your music," Bucciarelli said. "A lot of fans have
grown since then, so hopefully their tastes evolved too."
The band spent months working on a song, Bucciarelli
said, and each is unique.
"You have different vibes going on in this album, some
heavier and darker vibes," Bucciarelli said.
"Skeletons" remains a secret until the show. Bucciarelli
said he does not want to give too much away and humbly
mentioned that the band has expanded its sound and tried
new things.THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 19, 2009 +ALLIGATOR, 9
Musician creates acoustic tour
By JOEY FLECHAS
avenue writer
Sometimes, simplicity can feel startlingly fresh.
Hot Water Music veteran Chuck Ragan has run away with
the idea, organizingthe second year of The Revival Tour, a group
of more than 20 artists collaborating on acoustic music.
The tour will stop in Gainesville Friday night at the Common
Grounds. Doors open at 9 p.m.
The show will feature artists like Ragan, Jon Snodgrass, Jim
Ward and Gainesville native Jon Gaunt sharingthe stage in vari-
ous combinations, singing and playing on one another's tunes
freely.
"It's super simple, nothing that's never been done before,"
Ragan said.
Harking back to a Rolling Thunder Revue-style spirit, this
year's lineup features a disparate group of musicians, from folk-
sters to bluegrass players to Americana crooners.
With an average of 10 musicians on the bus on any given
stretch of the tour, Ragan has found that putting it all together
is as rewarding as it is difficult.
"I must say, as a musician, it has been probably the most
enjoyable way of touring I've done in my life and probably the
most challenging," he said.A goal for the musicians is to forsake the traditional struc-
ture of shows, with the predictable opening acts, breaks and
headliners. Ragan wants to leave behind all of that monotony.
"When the show starts, we present everyone from the begin-
ning. There's no ego on this run. We don't care who's going to
play first or who's goingto play last," he said.
With all of the players throwing caution to the wind, new col-
laborations spring up every night, and newcomers get to show
off their chops.
One of those newcomers is the first and only woman to join
The Revival Tour, Audra Mae. Ragan invited Mae to join after he
heard her music on her MySpace page. He eventually proved
instrumental in her getting a record deal.
At 25 years old, the gentle-voiced singer and songwriter is
glad to bring well-roundedness to the tour as a woman and as
the youngest performer, and she's thankful that the guys have
been nurturing, she said.
"The guys have been super protective," she said.
Friday's show is a sort of homecomingfor Ragan, who spent
10 years living here while playing in Hot Water Music. He loves
coming back to the scene that nurtured his musical ambitions
for years, he said.
"We have a lot of dear friends there. There's normally never
enough time to do all the fishing I want to do," he chuckled.

Aspiring designer Laura Vela's handbags lie amid her inspiration -fashion magazines,
sketches and her personal fashion scrapbook Vela's leather designs are made out of
fabrics from Argentina and are sold for less than $120* Barcelona native Laura Vela
will be studying at UF and sell-
ing her custom-made line of
handbags
By REBEKAH GEIER
avenue writer
Gainesville's fashion scene is
about to get more exclusive.
Laura Vela, 23, is selling one-of-
a-kind handbags to women like her-
self -those who love fashion and
see it as a form of self-expression
but don't want to be seen like every-
one else.
The Barcelona native and aspir-
ing designer will be in Gainesville
until August studying business
through UF's graduate international
exchange program.
"Fashion for me, whenever I think
about it, is a way of escaping what is
going on in the world," Vela said.
Vela, who studies executive man-
agement and fashion marketing at
ESADE, a business school in Spain,
is taking a break from business to
launch her own fashion line.
"I've always wanted to do some-
thing creative, but I am also aware
of how difficult it is to be someone in
this world," Vela said about her new
venture.
She already has one foot in the
industry: Vela studied at the Fashion
Institute of Technology in New York
City and contributed to Teen Vogue.
She has also styled A-list celebrities
while working at American Rebel
PR, including Jessica Alba, Leighton
Meester, Ed Westwick, Miley Cyrus,
Lindsay Lohan and Zac Efron.
Vela started designing handbags
four weeks ago, by accident. Af-
ter designing two bags just for fun,
hoards of compliments sparked the
young designer to consider starting
a business. The rest came natural-
ly.
"I just started drawing," Vela said
osu UIRD(D@lb. va @ tlTHURSDAY, NOVEMBER 19, 2009 + ALLIGATOR, 1 1
about the beginning designs for
her handbags. "At FIT I was taking
fashion-related classes, like styling
or upcoming trends, but not fashion
design."
Vela's personalized handbags
master the ability of combining high
fashion with high quality. She plans
on targeting women who look for in-
dividuality in the accessories they
buy, something they can't find at
stores like Forever 21, she said.
"I wantbto make the girl who
wears my bag to feel special and
unique," Vela said. "And since I want
to sell a purse that is unique, I want
it to be good quality."
Vela hand-picks the materials
used in producing her
Fashion handbags from fab-
ric stores in Buenos
Aires, Argentina. She
only uses real leather
or snakeskin. The extra embellish-
ments, such as silver studs and zip-
pers, come from Los Angeles or vin-
tage stores. Vela says the bags are
expected to last at least five years.
Vela says her designs are the per-
fect complement to a simple outfit.
So far, there is no precise style
to her line of handbags, which is the
point. Vela makes each design dif-
ferent so that there is variety.
"If today I am in a rock and roll
kind of mood, the black stud purse
would be perfect," Vela said regard-
ing the imagination she tries to cre-
ate to go along with her bags.
Her first design, for example, is a
muted colored snakeskin clutch in
baby blue, gray and mauve. Some
of her newer designs include a tan
handbag with ruffled layers and a
zebra-print interior, or a hot pink
snakeskin clutch smothered with
silver studs.
Vela's handbags can be pur-
chased for $100 to $120.
She is in the process of working
with local distributors and building
a Web site.

Band plays without gimmicks
By NICOLE LA HOZ
avenue writer
When Theory of a Deadman commands the
stage, there are no frills or gimmicks.
Guitarist Dave Brenner can't describe the
band's live performances. He said it will simply play
40 minutes worth of music this fall and "try to play
it really well."
On Nov. 30, the rock band from Vancouver, Brit-
ish Columbia, and Cavo will open up for Daughtry
on the Leave This Town tour in the O'Connell Cen-
ter. The show starts at 7:30 p.m. and tickets are
$29.50 to $39.50.
"A lot of the people that are coming to the
Daughtry shows don't know who the hell we are,"
Brenner said. "Hopefully they like what we do."
Before forming a band, singer and lead guitarist
Tyler Connolly, bassist Dean Beck and Brenner held
jobs involving glass, water bottles and fire protec-
tion services.
"They were all fun jobs," Brenner said. "We were
all happyto say good-bye to them."
Because their community was small, Connolly,
Beck and Brenner knew one another far before re-
cording an album.
Connolly's demo tape differed from the others,
however, catching the ear of Nickelback's ChadKroeger. He was signed to Kroeger's label, and
the band developed, releasing its self-titled debut
in 2002. "Nothing Could Come Between Us," the
album's hit single, bears strong resemblance to
Nickelback hits with its raspy melodic vocals and
catchy mid-tempo playing.
Theory of a Deadman has since evolved into a
pure rock band.
Brenner said "Scars & Souvenirs," the 2008
record, involved "a lot of jamming." The album re-
mains their focus for now. Members have dabbled
in new material on the side, but they haven't put
any songs together yet, Brenner said.
Aside from music, Theory of a Deadman is in-
volved with the Music Fashion Project. It picks a
"charity style" T-shirt and a portion of purchases
goes to band's favorite music-related charity.
The band has toured with acts like M6tley
Crue and Godsmack on CrQe Fest 2. Brenner said
he had fun hanging out on that tour because the
bands clicked.
Coming from CrQe Fest, Theory of a Deadman
didn't know what to expect at Daughtry concerts.
Daughtry has been really accepting Brenner said,
and crowds pack into venues by the time it per-
forms.
"They've been digging our music," he said.
"We're happy."Facebook reveals all
By LAUREN GOLD
avenue contributing writer
In high school, I jealously watched my
older sister on her laptop. She was on Fa-
cebook, a network exclusively for college
kids. I couldn't wait for college -if not for
the freedom, then definitely for the col-
lege e-mail address that would grant my
entry into the elite Facebook club.
Fast forward four years, and the world
ison Facebook. When Facebookextended
its membership to high school students,
myfriends and I gladly canceled our MyS-
pace accounts and made the switch.
When my 12-year-old brother logged in,
I was miffed, but I put him on limited pro-
file and moved on. When my friends' hip
mothers picked up on the trend, I ignored
my pangs of annoyance and begrudgingly
accepted their requests.
Now, my mom is begging me to let
her create an account. Though I appreci-
ate her asking my permission, I will deny
her until I am 40. When my 80-year-old
Grandma Hilda popped up as a "Friend
I Might Know," I lost it. What happenedto my prized Facebook world, my online
playground of funny photos and last
night's inside jokes plastered on my page
for my friends and I to enjoy, away from
the prying eyes of our nosy relatives?
What was once the addictive toy for
college students has become the entire
world's new pastime.
Friends of mine have recently disabled
their walls, made their pictures private or
even removed their surname from their
account, all in an effort to preserve their
personal lives. We know that employers
check out job applicants on the Internet.
We must be responsible, but censoring
ourselves makes Facebook lose part of
its entertainment value.
I keep my pictures classy, avoid
crude remarks and prevent anything
even slightly offensive from surfacing on
my Web space, but the online perks of
adolescent life are over. What was once
a simple, social networking tool for stu-
dents has become a database exchange
for professors, parents and even chil-
dren. Social networking is now public
networking.

Donovan goes to
athletic lineup late
HOOPS, from page 19
points. Georgia Southern had played Florida
close the last two years -contests UF won by
a combined 10 points -and the Eagles' athleti-
cism made it hard for the Gators to get into a
rhythm early on.
"When you have a lopsided win like that, it's
hard to get into a game like we were in today,"
Donovan said. "We needed a game like this. We
didn't need a 35-, 40-point win."
To close out the game, Donovan went to an
athletic, more experienced lineup of point guard
Erving Walker, Boynton, forward Chandler Par-
sons, forward Dan Werner and power forward
Alex Tyus. That meant taking out junior cen-
ter Vernon Macklin, who put up 15 points and
grabbed seven boards in just 19 minutes of play.
In the final 7:15, that lineup turned a seven-
point lead into a 20-point victory that made the
game seem like more of a blowout than it actu-
ally was.
In addition to wanting some of his veterans
in the game along with Boynton, Donovan also
made the decision to put in a team that could
match up man-to-man with the Eagles and take
away their 3-point shooting, usually the key fac-
tor when smaller schools pull off big upsets.
"The 3-point line concerned me when we had
a seven- or eight-point lead," Donovan said. "A
couple of threes, then the next thing you know,
you've got a one- or two-point lead."| .\ ,

satisfied with the win, as a team we played great de-
fense," Boynton said. "The shots are going to fall. All
we got to do is keep our defensive effort up, and I think
we're really good."
The Gators weren't much better than the Eagles of-
fensively, shooting 34 percent from the field and 2 for 16
(12.5 percent) from beyond the arc.
But Florida's ability to clamp down on defense, get
out in transition (10 fast-break points) and get to the free-
throw line (43 attempts) neutralized any shooting woes.
"We're tough to beat if we do all three of those things
consistently," forward Chandler Parsons said. "It starts
with defense. After that, you have to end each posses-
sion with a rebound."
Parsons led the team with 12 rebounds, including
seven on the defensive end.
After struggling to keep opponents off the offensive
glass in their two exhibition games, the Gators allowed
only nine offensive rebounds to the Eagles and out-
rebounded them 51-33 on the night.
Donovan said that a poor shooting night like this one
could have spelled disaster for his teams in the past two
years, but he was encouraged to see his team find a way
to win convincingly without any shots falling.
Freshman point guard Erving Walker, who shot 0 for
10, said this type of game and new attitude will pay divi-
dends as the season progresses.
"When our shots aren't falling, at least we have de-
fense to fall back on, that's what we understand," Walk-
er said. "We were last in the (Southeastern Conference)
in that last year and we still won nine games last year, so
hopefully if we correct that we can win 11 or 12."

Second-half surge leads Florida to win
0 KENNY BOYNTON HAD 15 OF HIS GAME-
HIGH 22 POINTS AFTER HALFTIME.
By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
a be rry@alIlIigator org
When the going got tough, Kenny Boynton got
going.
The freshman guard scored 22 points, nine of
which came from the free-throw line, as Florida (2-
0) overcame a sluggish first half and won a physical
game 69-49 against Georgia Southern on Wednes-
day night in the O'Connell Center.
Boynton's game-high scoring output came on
6-of-12 shooting from the field, including a 1-of-6
performance from 3-point range, but he got to the
free-throw line 13 times against the foul-prone Ea-
gles (1-2).
"I think he's got a little bit of that take-over men-
tality," UF coach Billy Donovan said. "He wants to
go get it, and he wants to go do it. I like that he's like
that. It's important he's like that for our team, then
we can try to channel him the right way."
Georgia Southern's physical play kept Florida
off its game early on, and UF took just a one-point
lead into halftime. But Boynton dropped in 15 in the
second half, when the Gators outscored the Eagles
43-24.
"I think we responded well to the physical play,"
Boynton said. "All we've got to do is keep knocking
down free throws, and that's what we did today."
Boynton and the Gators took advantage of the
Eagles' tight defense by drawing 32 fouls and get-
ting to the free throw line 43 times, making up for
their 2-for-16 performance from beyond the arc and
34 percent shooting for the game.
Overall, Donovan described his team's offense
Wednesday night as "pretty woeful."
"That was part of the reason we probably didn't
shoot as good of a percentage from the field," Dono-
van said. "It just seemed like we were shooting free
throws about every other possession."
Donovan attributed some of his team's first-half
Rayiaz Khan / Alligator Staff struggles to its exhibition and season-opening vic-

Gators' youth shows as season nears crucial juncture
By ANTHONY CHIANG
Alligator Writer
achiang@alligator org
In one of their biggest matches
of the season, a usual strength for
the Gators turned into a weakness.
No. 13 Florida's youth has been
a promising aspect of the team for
most of the season, but the lack of
experience has proven to be a dou-ble-edged sword.
Although the four starting soph-
omores don't usually play like un-
derclassmen, their youth showed
against LSU.
In Friday's match against the Ti-
gers, the Gators' lack of experience
was exposed as they lost against a
team that featured four starting se-
niors.
UF (20-4, 14-3 SoutheasternConference) hit
16 service errors
and recorded 25
attack errors in
the match, some-
thing coach Mary
Wise attributed
to the team's
youth.
"There were points where I felt
like maybe we pressed a little bittoo hard which sometimes you see
with a young team," she said. "The
service errors and the amount of
balls we hit out of bounds were in-
dicative of that."
The four sophomores hit seven
of those service errors and only
recorded one ace between them,
while LSU's four seniors only tal-
lied up one error behind the serviceAfter the loss, senior libero Elyse
Cusack pointed toward the Tigers'
experience as one of the reasons
they were able to pull out the win.
"I definitely think so," Cusack
said. "Experienced players play
well in tight situations."
In the final two sets of the match,
there was no confusion as to which
team possessed the group of se-

erases poor
shooting
By KYLE MAISTRI
Alligator Staff Writer

Florida shot miserably against
Georgia Southern on Wednesday
night, but the Gators opened up a
20-point win in the second half thanks
to their defense.
The Eagles shot 33 percent from
the field and 22 percent from the
3-point line, as UF outscored Georgia
Southern 43-24 in the second half.
Coach Billy Donovan said the
Gators will be able
to take more away
from their strong
defensive effortMen's than a crowd-
Basketball pleasing blowout
that might not force
the team to work as hard.
"Yeah, you're concerned a little
bit, you want to shoot the ball better,"
Donovan said. "But it's a reinforce-
ment right now they can see very,
very clearly, 'Wow, we ended up
winning by 20 points and look what
we shot from the field and the 3-point
line.' Hopefully that inspires them to
get even more intense and excited."
Freshman guard Kenny Boynton
scored a team-high 22 points but was
more proud of the team's defensive
performance than anything else.

GATORS SWIMMING
Dwyer looks to add to
early success at UF
By TONI-ANN MILLER
Alligator Writer
It is never too late to make
your dream a reality, and so
Florida junior Conor Dwyer has
proven.
Dwyer transferred to UF after
swimming at Iowa for two years.
While there, he set the school re-
cord in the 100-yard freestyle at
the Big Ten Championships last
season.
Since coming to Florida, he has
picked up right where he left off.
In his first meet this season,
on Oct. 9, the junior won the 200
free, and he has continued to ex-
cel for UF since.
"Conor Dwyer, right now,
has been one of the most pleas-
ant surprises," coach Gregg Troy
said. "He's extremely versatile
and he comes to practice every
day with a great attitude. He's
going to be a big player at the
NCAA (meet)."
Dwyer said he grew up a
Gators fan, but that coming outof high school, he was not as fast.
Iowa offered him an opportunity
to compete and he made the best
of it. However, one summer in
Gainesville changed everything.
"I was looking for a place to
train over the summer, I had fam-
ily an hour away and I'd been a
Gators fan growing up," Dwyer
said. "I just loved it when I came
here to train, and I decided to
stay."
This weekend he'll have an-
other opportunity to show his
abilities in the pool when UF
splits for the Georgia Tech Invi-
tational today through Saturday,
and the South Carolina Invita-
tional, which runs today and Fri-
day.
UF's women will also break up
and compete in the two meets.
"We have a smaller group on
each side, at each meet, and ev-
eryone has some relay opportu-
nities," Troy said. "It makes us
slightly weaker team-wise, but
we get a better feel for where a
lot of people are."
LSU able to cut down errors
VOLLEY, from page 19
niors.
Both teams struggled in the first two frames with 13 attack
errors each, but the third and fourth sets were the ones that
set the two teams apart. The Gators hit 12 errors in the final
two sets, while LSU was able to make some in-match adjust-
ments and cut their number down to four in the second half
of the match.
One of the sophomores, Colleen Ward, noticed that LSU
had a different mentality than the Gators during the match.
"They definitely have a different type of attitude with all
the seniors that they have," Ward said.
However, Cusack does not want the team to start using
their youth as a crutch.
"In big matches like last week against LSU, our effort was
there and just sometimes we don't execute," she said. "We
might not be the most experienced team, but we can't use that
as an excuse as to why we aren't winning matches."
While the four sophomores were overmatched by LSU's
four seniors on Friday, in a couple of years UF's group will
have the chance to return the favor.
"That core group of sophomores, they are going to be able
to do that to a young team some day," Wise said.Andrew Stanfill / Alligator Staff

season
ends in
injury
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
MIAMI -Ronnie Brown's
season has ended with an in-
jury- again.
The Miami Dolphins' lead-
ing rusher was placed on
injured reserve Wednesday
because of a right foot injury
suffered in Sunday's victory
over Tampa Bay.
A fifth-year pro, Brown
missed the final nine games
of the 2007 season with a right
knee injury.
The Dolphins had hoped
Brown might be able to return
this year but made the roster
move after he was examined
by a specialist. It's a big blow
for a team that ranks fourth in
the NFL in rushing and 30th in
passing.
The move was announced
shortly after the Dolphins (4-5)
departed for Thursday's game
against Carolina. Ricky Wil-
liams, the 2002 NFL rushing
champion, will replace Brown
in the starting lineup.
Brown was on pace for the
best year of his career with
648 yards rushing and eight
touchdowns, and he threw for
another.
He was the triggerman in
the wildcat, and it's uncertain
how much the Dolphins will
use the package with Williams
taking snaps.
Williams has rushed for 558
yards. He's coming off his first
100-yard game of the season
and is averaging a career-best
5.3 yards per carry, but he's 32,
and it's uncertain whether he
can handle a workhorse role.
The backup running back
is now 2008 sixth-round draft
pick Lex Hilliard, who has yet
to carry the ball in the NFL.
