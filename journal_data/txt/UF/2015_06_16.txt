“The Lorax” sits on Kim Tanzer’s cof-
fee table.
She reads Dr. Seuss’ environmental call 
to action, aloud: “Unless someone like you 
cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to 
get better. It’s not.”
Tanzer, a former UF Board of Trustees 
member, said she is disappointed in UF’s 
conservation efforts.
In January, the University Athletic As-
sociation asked UF’s Lakes, Vegetation and Landscaping Committee to approve the removal of nine mature loblolly pines in the Bat House Woods conservation 
area, which borders UF golf course’s sev-
enth green. The trees cast too much shade on the course’s grass, said Scott Hampton, director of UF Golf Courses.
The committee voted unanimously to 
recommend the almost 80-foot-tall pines be removed.  Curtis Reynolds, UF’s vice president for Business Affairs, accepted their recommendation March 31. 
UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes said on 
Thursday that UF put its plans to cut down the trees on hold.
But Tanzer and her husband, Rod Mc-
Galliard, are still ﬁ  ghting for the trees. The couple lives in Golfview, a neighborhood We Inform. You Decide. www.alligator.org

UF COMPLETED ITS INVESTIGATION ON

A UF investigation conﬁ  rmed that members of its Zeta 
Beta Tau fraternity chapter acted inappropriately while stay-
ing at a Panama City Beach resort for their three-day Spring formal.
However, it did not show that the misbehavior was pur-
posely targeted at veterans, who were also staying at the same resort.
The school completed its investigation June 5 and re-
leased a 132-page report late last week that included the fol-lowing:
 Emails to and from UF ofﬁ  cials, ZBT representa-tives, Warrior Beach Retreat founder Linda Cope and the Laketown Wharf Retreat.
 Notes from the UF ZBT chapter’s internal investiga-tion.
 Interviews with more than 60 students, including students in the ZBT fraternity as well as their dates for the Spring formal.
 Interviews with 10 witnesses afﬁ  liated with the Warrior Beach Retreat.
 The 22-page Panama City Beach Police Department investigation report, which was released June 2 and said no criminal charges would be ﬁ  led because the department was unable to establish probable cause 
or positively identify suspects.
Following the investigation, UF charged the chapter with 
three student conduct code violations: causing physical 
harm to any person, obscenity and public intoxication.
Early reports of the incident said students from UF’s 
and Emory University’s chapters of ZBT removed or stole ZBT charged with conduct violationsNicole Gomez / Alligator Staff

Keith Richards led a group of 
bicyclists along the Gainesville-
Hawthorne State Trail to the first 
Active Streets event in Hawthorne 
on Sunday morning.
The group of about 15 left Rich-
ards’ bicycle store, Swift Cycle, lo-
cated on West University Avenue, 
at about 10 a.m. and arrived at the event about 90 minutes later. 
For some riders, it was their 
first time biking the 16-mile trail 
to Hawthorne, Richards said.
His group was one of the few 
bicycling groups that attended 
Active Streets. The Active Streets 
Alliance, City of Hawthorne and 
Gainesville Cycling Club hosted the free community event from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.
The Active Streets Alliance pre-
viously organized two events in Gainesville: Open Streets in Octo-ber and Active Streets in February.
Thirty local businesses and or-
ganizations set up booths to lead activities along Johnson Street. Participants were able to jump rope, draw with chalk and ride bi-cycles in the middle of the road.
The Sexton family came out to 
support its community. Sam, Kylee and their daughter, Kieran, agreed their favorite part was being able to try out different bicycles as part of Gator Cycle’s activity.
But Sam Sexton said he was 
worried the event didn’t have enough support in Hawthorne.
“It’d be nice to see more locals 
contribute their time,” he said.
However, Joseph Floyd, the 
Active Streets Alliance executive director, was happy with the turn-out. 
He estimated about 200 people 
attended.
“If you compare it to Gainesville on a proportional basis, it has out-done what (Open Streets) did,” he said.
Open Streets attracted 47 busi-
nesses and 6,000 people. Haw-thorne has a population of about 1,500 people, which means it hosted 66 percent as many activi-
ties as Open Streets with only 1 
percent of Gainesville’s popula-tion, Floyd said.
The purpose of Active Streets 
is to promote physical activity, healthy lifestyles and human in-teraction within a community. It also encourages people to play in the roads while feeling safe, he 
said.
“You experience the space in a 
different way,” he said.
Ellen Vause, the city manag-
er, sat at the city’s booth, which 
displayed information about one upcoming improvement already in the works: the Johnson Street road reconstruction project.
Next February, the street will 
be repaved in a serpentine shape, which will slow traffic, and a shared bike lane will be added, 
Vause said.
The road will connect the end 
of the Gainesville-Hawthorne 
State Trail to Little Orange Creek Nature Park, which is not yet 
open to the public.

and urinated and threw objects off balconies, among other things. Several of the rooms oc-cupied by UF ZBT members also received noise complaints during their stay, according 
to the report.
Both the UF-conducted interviews and the 
ZBT chapter’s internal investigation revealed 
that one student, while intoxicated, took an American flag that was staked to the ground and waved it around but returned it after a group of veterans approached him. Another student interviewed in the investigation said he vomited on his balcony the first night he 
was at the resort but added none went off the 
balcony. A third said he went to the balcony of his room to open a bottle of champagne to make mimosas and some of it might have poured out. The interviews also showed the majority of the students did not know the vet-erans group was also staying at the resort.
UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes wrote in 
an email that the fraternity is currently going through a conduct process, which will deter-mine what happens to the organization. She added there will be a hearing between the fra-ternity chapter and UF regarding the conduct violations, but a date has not been scheduled.
ZBT has already been on probation twice, 
Sikes said, and would probably be suspend-
ed if the chapter is found responsible for the 
charges UF has levied against it. However, if the chapter is found not responsible for the charges, Sikes said it will be eligible to reopen from UF’s side of the situation.
adjacent to the bat houses, the conservation area and the golf course.
McGalliard, a UF alumnus, said the 
press release UF sent out doesn’t explicitly state the trees won’t be removed. Instead, it reads that the pines won’t be removed unless they are found to be diseased.
“I’ve seen a lot of dead and dying and 
diseased pine trees in my life,” McGalliard, 67, said, adding these trees aren’t sick enough to remove.
McGalliard said it’s another excuse to 
cut down the pines, as possible diseases weren’t among the reasons the course orig-inally listed to the committee.
He said Reynolds called him and made 
it seem like cutting the pines down was out of the question and said UF’s incon-sistencies between the press release and his phone conversation with Reynolds are “just as phony as a $3 bill.”
The ecology of the area is Tanzer’s main 
concern.
“(The trees) add a layer of shade and 
protection — and even wind protection in the case of storms — that nothing else adds, and so it’s important for the diversity of the whole woodland to keep them,” she said.
The area contains a natural lake and a 
stream that connects to Lake Alice when it rains, Tanzer said. Additionally, the stream 
injects into the aquifer, making it “signifi-
cant in its own right.” Tanzer said she feels UF is “relinquishing its responsibility and letting the golf course run a conservation area.”
UF has to balance several issues, Sikes 
said, including managing an NCAA golf course and the woods. She said UF has a long history of working with Golfview resi-
dents, and not announcing their previous plans to cut down the trees was an over-
sight.
“We strive to be a good neighbor for 
those who live adjacent to us,” Sikes said.
The course probably won’t replace the 
seventh green’s Ultradwarf grass with something more shade-tolerant and fungus-resistant, said Denver Parler, an assistant director of communications at the UAA.
“We want to maintain consistency,” 
Parler said.
The trees that were to be removed were 
known to be diseased, he said. The UAA reached out to arborists to evaluate the trees last week. There are no deadlines for when one would be hired, Parler said.
However, UF isn’t evaluating all old 
trees on campus, even though many could be diseased, said Jason Smith, a UF forest pathology professor.
“Nobody’s really making an effort to in-
spect those trees,” he said.
Because of their age, it’s likely the pines 
in Bat House Woods are infected, Smith said.
But “that doesn’t mean they can’t be 
around for several more decades and serve a lot of good,” he said.
UF needs a clear plan detailing how to 
manage conservation areas, Smith said. They could also hire an arborist, which UF hasn’t had in almost a decade.
If the trees are cut, mitigation money 
would likely be used to remove invasive plants from the area, said Gail Hansen, the Lakes, Vegetation and Landscaping Com-mittee chair.
But McGalliard and Tanzer said they 
could raise enough money in a weekend to match mitigation funds, and they would get volunteers to clear out nonnative plants.
“We want the golf course to be success-
ful,” Tanzer said. “We just want them to stay on the golf course.”TREE,  from pg1They said they will only cut

DANNEMORA, N.Y. — A woman 
charged with helping two murderers 
escape from a maximum-security prison by providing them hacksaw blades, chisels and other tools, made 
another court appearance Monday 
as a manhunt in far northern New York marked its 10th day.
The local schools reopened with added police patrols and more than 800 law enforcement officers con-tinued their search for Richard Matt and David Sweat, who escaped from the Clinton Correctional Facility near the Canadian border June 6.
Prosecutors say Joyce Mitchell, a 
prison tailoring shop instructor who had befriended the inmates, had agreed to be the getaway driver but backed out because she still loved her husband and felt guilty for par-ticipating.
Mitchell, 51, made her second 
court appearance in Plattsburgh. She waived a preliminary hearing, and the case headed to a county court.
“Basically, when it was go-time 
and it was the actual day of the 
event, I do think she got cold feet 
and realized, ‘What am I doing?’” Clinton County District Attorney Andrew Wylie said Sunday. “Real-ity struck. She realized that, really, the grass wasn’t greener on the other side.”
Wylie said there was no evidence 
the men had a Plan B once Mitch-ell backed out, and no vehicles have been reported stolen in the area. That has led searchers to believe 
the men are still near the prison in 
Dannemora.
Sweat, 35, was serving a life sen-
tence without parole for killing a sheriff’s deputy. Matt, 48, was doing 25 years to life for the 1997 kidnap, torture and hacksaw dismember-ment of his former boss.
Mitchell was charged Friday 
with also supplying a punch and a screwdriver to the two inmates. Her lawyer entered a not-guilty plea on 
her behalf. She has been suspended 
without pay from her $57,000-a-year job overseeing inmates who sew clothes and learn to repair sewing machines at the prison.

INFORMATION ABOUT 
THE HOME.

Alligator Contributing Writer
About 3 miles west of Interstate 
75 on Archer Road is the area where 
the Kanapaha Plantation once was and where a house built by enslaved craftsmen remains.
A small building that looks closed 
is in sight from the turn off of Ar-cher, and a sign reads, “Please go down the path.”
As the end of the path nears, a 
historical interpreter — or docent — greets you, and a look into history begins at the Historic Haile Home-stead.
Located at 8500 SW Archer Road, 
the homestead is a nonprofit organi-zation and has hosted tours of the antebellum house museum since it was opened to the public in 2001.
And with the number of guests 
coming to the house increasing and a new visitor center opening soon, the organization is looking for more volunteers to give tours of the house 
as docents.
To be a volunteer, the commit-
ment consists of one four-hour shift 
a month and a $20 annual member-ship fee. The volunteers work on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. and 
Sundays from noon to 4 p.m. 
If special group tours have been 
arranged, they can also work week-
days.Karen Kirkman, the president of 
the organization, teaches each vol-
unteer the information he or she 
needs to know.
“It’s a great problem to have,” 
Kirkman said of needing volunteers. “We’ve waited 10 years for (the visi-tor center).”
A grant was given to the organi-
zation but it was not enough to build 
the entire center.
Money was raised for about 10 
years to finish building the visitor 
center. Outside of a coat of paint and 
the creation of exhibits, the center is complete.
The homestead is kept running 
through tour fees, donations and an-nual memberships.
The visitor center was built in sec-
tions because there was not enough money, Kirkman said. 
When the visitor center opens, 
Kirkman said they hope to have two volunteers in the center and two at the house. Guests will pay the $5 tour fee and learn the background in-formation of the home in the comfort of air conditioning or heating. Tours are free to children 12 and under.
The background information on the Haile family and the history of the home will be described through 
a video and exhibits that will be set 
up.
Ashley Hoyt, 17, has been a vol-
unteer since she was 14, following in the footsteps of her sister.
Hoyt is in the International Bac-
calaureate program at Eastside High School and said she completes the volunteer requirement through be-
ing a docent at the Haile Homestead.
She said it helps her in American 
history classes by allowing her to un-
derstand the context of how people used to live, and she thinks that people should not be afraid to come check it out and become a volunteer.
“I feel like a lot of people think 
they are not good at history, or it’ll 
take up too much time,” Hoyt said, 
“but it’s not bad at all.”
Leanna McClellan, the assistant 
director of docents, also volunteers at the house and said she is looking forward to the visitor center open-ing.
“The center will make it easier 
for people to find us instead of see-
ing the sign to follow the path,” Mc-
Clellan said.           TUESDAY, JUNE 16, 2015   ALLIGATOR   5

The UF College of Journalism and Com-
munications will broaden its reach with the 
addition of two radio stations in the Fall.
Beginning in August, WRUF-AM 850 
will also broadcast on an FM station, and 
a new station featuring classical music will 
begin later in the semester.
“There’s no better place in the world 
to learn this craft,” said Randall Wright, the executive director of media properties. “The experiences we have here for the stu-dents are richer than anywhere else.”
WRUF-AM 850, the AM sports program, 
will begin to broadcast on an additional frequency at 95.3 FM. 
The move to FM will provide the sta-
tion with better sound quality and a large amount of additional exposure, Wright said.
The classical-music station will find its 
home on 92.1 FM and provide listeners with an experience rich in art. 
With students in the journalism pro-
grams working closely with those involved 
in the College of the Arts, the station will eventually expand to live concerts and 
other programs associated with fine arts, Wright said.  
The stations’ websites will be getting a 
makeover before relaunching in the Fall. The platforms will continue to be sup-
ported by students in the college who are producing original content alongside pro-fessionals.
Ben Murphy, a 20-year-old UF telecom-
munication junior, co-hosts sports seg-ments for WRUF-AM 850 and covers the 
UF baseball team as a beat reporter who 
gathers interviews and sound bites for the station.
“I’m getting my feet wet and getting to 
work as a professional while still in col-lege,” Murphy said, “and the exposure of the news stations will just further that.”WUFT set to add two new radio stations in Fall semester

ColumnJeb Bush joins 
an overflowing 
GOP pool
Jeb Bush announced his candidacy for presidency Mon-
day. About time, if you ask us. 
The former Florida governor has been dragging his 
feet, collecting funds and “testing the waters” for an 
announcement that many of us have long since pre-
dicted in Florida. I’m sure we all had a good laugh earlier 
this month when he told CBS that his candidacy was up in the air.
Well, it’s out in the open now, and it’s our job to edito-
rialize the matter.
In an announcement at Miami Dade College, he touted 
his history as Florida’s governor and bragged at some length regarding his achievements therein. While we at the Alliga-
tor are always happy to support the local team, we can’t 
help but feel that Bush might be walking in his family’s governmental shadows and swimming about as another big name in the sea of ones making up the Grand Old Party candidates thus far, including the likes of Bobby Jindal, Ted 
Cruz and other old and bleached candidates.
Forgive us if the last comment seems unfair, but seri-
ously, try scrolling down the GOP candidate list. The Demo-
crats list isn’t much better, but at least Morrison Bonpasse 
has an impressive beard to distract us.
We digress — Bush’s record in Florida has been very 
well received by his home state.
There is a good chance, like it or not, that some voters 
are going to look at Bush and his conservative background and see little more than a Bush 2.0, which, while unfair, 
is a reality he’ll need to work around if he wants to make progress on the matter. Some people might see him as an example of a tried-and-tested leader, but others might see 
his claim as an entitled grab for the president’s seat. The 
Bush name may very well be both a blessing and a curse to our latest GOP candidate.
In any case, let’s see how he stacks up in a broad sense 
over a fellow Floridian.
His gubernatorial past may give him an edge over fel-
low candidate Marco Rubio, who announced his candidacy about two months ago. Both men have strong ties to their native state, but you could argue to some extent Rubio’s 
ties to Florida’s large Cuban population give him the edge 
in getting minority support. 
Once again, Bush previously served as governor, but Ru-
bio is currently a senator, and Bush hasn’t been too politi-cally prolific since his term ended nearly a decade ago in 
2007. 
Nonetheless, he was still one of the most popular Florida 
governors in the past 30 years, at least according to a Janu-
ary Mason-Dixon poll.
Still, an uncontested reason why the GOP lost the last 
election was a choice to ignore the Hispanic vote. 
While Bush’s been making announcements and forays all 
over to bridge the divide, he may simply not be half as at-tractive as Rubio, whose experiences are just an edge more 
of a cultural link.
Rachel Dolezal’s case is not just black and white
Last week, the Spokesman-Review 
questioned whether the president of the NAACP Spokane, Rachel Dolezal, was black. 
This has brought up questions about 
what makes up identity and comparisons to Caitlyn Jenner. 
Dolezal has yet to explain herself or 
respond to what her family has said about her. 
However, comparing whatever is going on with 
Rachel Dolezal to transgender issues is a slippery and problematic slope rooted in transphobia. 
Caitlyn Jenner is not lying about her identity. She is 
a woman. 
Regardless of Dolezal’s reasoning behind her 
claiming a black identity, she should not be used to discredit transgender identities.
Some have also compared Dolezal to light-skinned 
blacks who would try to pass as white, but that is also 
not the same. 
Historically, people of color have tried to pass as 
white whenever possible, because white people have privilege. 
Dolezal did not need to be black in order to be 
elected president of her local NAACP chapter, because the NAACP has had white allies in leadership positions before. 
Instead, she appropriated experiences that were not 
her own and lied about her family. 
The idea that people would lie about their identities 
is one of the arguments that is used by activists against affirmative action, such as Vijay Chokal-Ingam, 
who claimed to have gotten into medical school by 
pretending to be black. 
We still don’t know how Dolezal may have benefitted 
or why she decided to identify as black. When talking about issues of race, ideas 
about one race may not be applicable to another because they have different 
institutional power. 
A recent example of this is Emma Stone’s 
casting in the recent movie “Aloha.” 
When white people represent people of 
another race, such as Stone did, it hurts the 
chances of Asian actors to get the few roles that are available to them. 
Stone was cast as a part Hawaiian, part Chinese 
protagonist despite being white. 
Actors do not have to exactly match their role’s 
ethnicity, but when white actors take away roles meant for people of color, it’s a problem. 
Though many tried to compare this to traditionally 
white roles being cast as other races, it’s just not the same thing because there are tons of roles for white actors out there. 
Ultimately, many have tried to compare what Dolezal 
did with the reverse: passing as white.
This was because they knew that they would get 
more opportunities and be able to protect themselves from hate crimes as a white person. 
Dolezal’s case is unusual, and thus it really cannot 
be compared with any other type of identity issue.

Gainesville’s newest park is 
more than just a recreational space. It’s a collaborative project engi-neered to benefit the environment. 
Sweetwater Wetlands Park, lo-
cated at 325 SW Williston Road, hosted its grand opening and rib-bon-cutting event Friday. The park is open to the public Saturdays and Sundays from 7 a.m. to sunset. En-
trance fees are $5 per car or $2 for 
pedestrians, bicyclists and buses.  
The park is in the shape of the 
Gator head, which started out as a joke, said Stu Pearson, the City of Gainesville project manager. 
“Engineers can be silly every 
once in a while,” Pearson said. 
During the ceremony, Mayor Ed 
Braddy cut the ribbon to officially open the park, which began con-struction in 2012. 
“We are a community that is not 
content with being very good. We have to be great,” Braddy said. “We are going to create a wonderful park that people can come and enjoy and 
see nature at its finest.” 
Walter Nickel, the project man-
ager for the design, said the main 
benefits of the park are stormwater treatment and water-quality im-provement. 
The project engineers rehy-
drated the prairie by creating 125 acres of wetland cells and restoring 1,300 acres of wetlands, according to a press release. The purpose is to improve the water quality in the Alachua sink by acting as a filter. 
The project cost $26.5 million. 
The City of Gainesville contrib-uted $22 million to the restoration project while the rest of the money came from organizations that do-
nated.
Nature seekers can expect to en-
counter wild horses, gators and rare 
birds roaming the prairie. The de-sign engineers planted tree islands, dead trees created to enhance bird-ing habitat, to act as a magnet for nesting birds. 
“This is going to be a hot spot 
for people all over the state to come out here bird watching,” said Deb-bie Segal of Wetland Solutions and Alachua Audubon. “It’s going to generate a lot of money for the economy.” 
The project has received in-
put from 15 agencies, including Gainesville Regional Utilities, the 
City of Gainesville and Florida Fish 
and Wildlife. 
“The genius of the project is 
bringing all of those minds together and all of those resources together and going into one direction,” said Robert Edmunds, the co-founder of Jones Edmunds, the engineering firm that designed the project. Sweetwater Wetlands Park opensLOCAL

A length of yellow chain cordons 
off the giant silver brewing tanks from the rest of the warehouse, where visi-tors sit at picnic tables and kids play cornhole.  
Under a banner that reads First 
Magnitude Brewing Company, a small section of concrete floor has been cleared in preparation for a new milestone in the company’s growth.
First Magnitude Brewing Com-
pany, 1220 SE Veitch St., plans to start canning its beers for sale at local retailers. The beer will be canned in-
house, adjacent to where it is brewed.    
Meg The Losen, one of the own-
ers, said the business has always 
planned to can their beers.
Canning would place First Mag-
nitude’s beer in retailers around Gainesville. The Losen said they have begun talks with Ward’s Supermar-ket, Lucky’s Market and ABC, as well 
as smaller, independent stores. Even-
tually, The Losen said, she hopes cus-tomers will be able to find First Mag-nitude beer on the shelves at Publix.
John Denny, one of First Magni-
tude’s two brewers, called canning a very necessary step.  
“Draft-only is wonderful but limit-
ing at the same time,” he said.  
First Magnitude’s products will 
join Swamp Head’s — another local brewery — on retail shelves. Swamp Head has been canning its beer for approximately eight months, said Brandon Nappy, the tactical market-ing manager for Swamp Head. He called craft beer a collaborative in-dustry and expressed his congratula-
tions to First Magnitude for taking an 
important step toward expansion.
“The more the merrier, as far as 
craft beer goes,” Nappy said. “I’m super stoked and pumped for them continuing to expand.”First Magnitude to

A $25 million UF College of Education 
project that helps teachers serve students 
with disabilities has expanded to ﬁ  ve more states.
The Collaboration for Effective Educator 
Development, Accountability and Reform recently added Arizona, Michigan, Missouri, Oregon and Tennessee to its project, bring-ing the number of involved states to 15. 
“If you’re a parent of a student with a 
disability, nothing is more important to you than the quality of education that your child receives,” said Mary Brownell, a center direc-tor and UF professor who has been working more than two decades on special education.
People walk by the CEEDAR Center in 
the UF College of Education every day, not knowing it’s a $25 million program that’s 
affecting the way teachers teach, said Jonté 
Myers, a graduate assistant who specializes in special education.
The goal of CEEDAR is to make sure 
preparation programs helping general edu-cation teachers and leaders serving students with disabilities are able to do so using the best research available. On the state level, the center strives to design policies that encourage that.
“If we were able to ac-
complish that in every state,” Brownell said, “I 
would feel like I have ac-
complished my life goals, really, which is to improve 
education for students with disabilities.”
The center’s ofﬁ  cial launch date was Jan-
uary 13, 2013, but it had been an ongoing project started in 2012 by Brownell and Paul Sindelar, a center co-director. 
The UF CEEDAR team is a collaboration, 
often working closely together with each other and the states involved. Graduate as-sistants and professors alike are assigned to different states but come together to talk, Myers, 33, said.
It’s a passion they all have, and that pas-
sion ﬁ  lls that room, Myers said. They call it the CEEDAR village sometimes, he said, be-cause it’s like a family.
The CEEDAR center takes on a universal 
approach to teaching, making sure that every child could have the same opportunities.
Five more states involved in College of Education project Gainesville Throwbacks
6/20/1972: UF conducts an internal moral study of its dorm-room life fol-lowing the publication of an article by St. Petersburg Times reporter Chris Cubbison, who contended that UF 
students were engaged in widespread 
usage of marijuana, alcohol and free and open sex. UF’s report found that only half of students had partaken in marijuana, and 22 students who lived in a dorm denied the presence of either drugs or alcohol in their dorm.6/18/1974: Wendy LeBaron, a 19-year-old UF student, was found murdered in Coral Gables following a small house ﬁ  re in her family home’s living room. She was found in a canal 24 hours lat-
er, shot several times and fully clothed. 
Police made no connection to the ﬁ  re and LeBaron’s death. Her family of-fered a $6,000 reward for any informa-tion leading to the arrest and convic-tion of LeBaron’s assailant. 6/18/1992: Dennis “Murli” Watkins, 48, claims God spoke to him on a mountain and told him to devote his life to marijuana. Judge Elzie Sanders spoke in turn and sentenced Watkins to four months in jail for possession 
and delivery of marijuana. Watkins is 
a marijuana activist who received more than $11,000 in contributions to argue the unconstitutionality of the marijua-na laws in Florida. He argued that “this seed is constitutionally part of our uni-verse.” He also lost that particular case.6/18/1996: Cafe Expresso, an estab-lishment which featured nude dancers, sues the city of Gainesville in hopes of reversing the public nudity ordinance. The restaurant’s attorney, Gary Eding-
er, contends the ordinance was passed 
speciﬁ  cally to close down their busi-ness. Cafe Expresso seeks compensa-tion for loss of $150,000 invested in 
their business.

TRIPLE JUMP TITLE AT 
NCAA OUTDOORS
By Kyle Brutman
Alligator Writer
@KBrut13       
Last one, best one.
That has been Marquis Dendy's 
motto all year.
It’s the only way he would 
have wanted his career at the University of Florida to end.
And it did.Leading up to Friday’s NCAA 
Outdoor triple jump champion-
ship in Eugene, Oregon, the se-
nior jumper from Middletown, Delaware, had won all of the na-tional and conference long jump 
titles in 2015. Dendy needed the 
win in his ﬁ  nal collegiate event to complete the triple jump sweep for the year.
He wasted no time.
On his ﬁ  rst jump, he ﬂ  ew 17.50 
meters, putting himself on top of 
UF’s all-time list in the event.
But he wasn’t done.His second jump was even bet-
ter.
On his last jump — of the 
event, meet, season and historic Florida career — Dendy soared 17.71 meters (58.25 feet) to the 
triple jump title.
With the jump, he set the 
third-best all-conditions mark in 
collegiate history, as well as a new record for an NCAA meet.
“Going in, my thought process 
was that this was my last jump as a collegiate athlete and I deﬁ  -nitely wanted to hit the 58-foot mark, so I went after it and it felt so good when I landed,” Dendy said in a release. “I kind of knew it was big, but I wasn’t sure right away.”  
A lot had happened between 
his ﬁ  nal jump at UF and the start of his career.
In 2012, coming into 
Gainesville as DyeStat’s No. 1 high school triple and long jump-
er in the country, Dendy was not 
hesitant to introduce himself to the collegiate world.
He ended his ﬁ  rst conference 
meet as the Southeastern Confer-
ence’s indoor long jump cham-
pion.
He won his ﬁ  rst national title 
at the 2013 Indoor Champion-
ships, sporting a then-career best 
8.28 meters.
Following his recovery from 
a torn labrum that deterred him from winning any conference or 
national titles during the 2014 in-
door season, Dendy restarted his reign of domination.
Aside from the 2014 SEC out-
door long jump event, he went on to win every conference and na-tional event he competed in, win-ning six national titles and ﬁ  ve SEC titles in that span.
Now, he’s one of the most dec-
orated long and triple jumpers in program history.
“I think Marquis Dendy is 
arguably the best combination jumper to come out of the Univer-sity of Florida,” coach Mike Hol-loway said in a release.
Fifty-eight feet was Dendy’s 
goal all season.
A goal he completed with the 
one of the best jumps of his ca-reer — his last one, and his best 
one.

INSTAGRAHAM
The University of Florida, 
along with nine other schools, has received criti-
cism for the systems in 
place that seemingly indi-
cate that athletes receive prefer-ential treatment when accused of 
criminal activity.
An Outside the Lines investiga-
tion led by ESPN Staff Writer Paula 
Lavigne with help from others, published Sunday and broadcasted in a video Monday 
on ESPN, revealed that 80 players on Flor-
ida’s football and men’s basketball rosters were named as suspects in 119 crimes from 2009 to 2014 — more than any of the other 
nine programs detailed in the investigation.
To get a full perspective of how wide-
spread the alleged criminal activity extends, consider that 24 percent of play-
ers on rosters for the two UF pro-grams were named suspects in 
a crime, and 56 percent of these 
cases were dropped or not pros-ecuted.
However you spin it, the sta-
tistics are alarming, and the full report details a football program that consisted of mostly Urban 
Meyer-recruited players that seemingly had the penchant for ﬁ  nding themselves under 
investigation by law enforcement.
If there’s one player who epitomizes the 
leniency demonstrated to Florida athletes, 
it’s Chris Rainey.

After defeating No. 5 national seed Mi-

Florida advanced to face Virginia on Mon-day. 
Due to a postponed ﬁ  nish 
between Vanderbilt and Cal State Fullerton, which was suspended Sunday night due to inclement weather and re-sumed on Monday at 3 p.m., UF’s matchup with UVA was pushed back to a 10:09 p.m start on Monday. For com-plete coverage of last night’s game between the Gators and Cavaliers, visit alligator.org.
The College World Series saw two walk off ninth innings on Monday, as Vanderbilt edged past Cal State Fullerton 4-3 and Mi-
ami defeated Arkansas 4-3.
Commodore outﬁ  elder Jeren Kendall 
hit a two-run home run in the bottom of 
the ninth inning, marking the ﬁ  rst walk-off homer in TD Ameritrade Park History.
Miami’s Jacob Heyward 
sealed the Hurricanes’ win over the Razorbacks, blast-ing a line-drive RBI single in the ninth to eliminate Ar-
kansas from the CWS.
Vanderbilt advanced to face TCU on 
Tuesday, while Miami will face the loser

ﬁ  ve crimes but was only charged 
once, spoke to Lavigne and Out-side the Lines about his experi-
ences with facing criminal accusa-
tions.
His attorney, Huntley Johnson, 
has represented Florida athletes 
for years, and Gainesville Police 
Department spokesperson Ben Tobias told Outside the Lines that “sometimes we joke that (Huntley Johnson’s) got a better communi-
cation system than 911.”
Rainey seemingly conﬁ  rmed 
as much when he told Outside 
the Lines that athletes around the program were conﬁ  dent in John-son’s ability to keep them away 
from police, and therefore out of 
the news.
“You still got Huntley, so, if 
anything happens, we got Hunt-
ley,” Rainey said “So, he will get 
you out of anything, everything.”
Rainey was part of a speedy UF backﬁ  eld that featured fellow track 
athlete Jeff Demps, but before he 
was a Gator, Rainey was living with the family of twins Maurkice and Mike Pouncey in Lakeland.
The trio was highly regarded 
at Lakeland South High, helping lead the Dreadnaughts to three consecutive Florida Class 5A state championships before Urban Mey-
er landed them.
The Pouncey twins, vocal ad-
vocates of former New England 
Patriots tight end and convicted ﬁ  rst-degree murderer Aaron Her-
nandez, have had their share of 
criminal accusations since they’ve been in the NFL.
A lot of the blame has been 
placed at the hands of former Flor-ida and current Ohio State head coach Urban Meyer, who recruited Hernandez, Rainey and the Pounc-ey twins, among others detailed in 
the Outside the Lines report.
I don’t think Meyer could have 
anticipated that a then-17-year old 
Hernandez was capable of mur-der, because that’s not something 
in-home visits and text messaging 
could possibly indicate.
But Meyer soon realized that 
Hernandez had character issues, and I’m sure he’s not the only UF athlete that raised some red ﬂ  ags 
behind closed doors.
“First of all, I didn’t believe it. 
Then you start reading about it,” 
Meyer told Dan Patrick on April 28 about hearing of Hernandez’s involvement. “I never spoke with 
him, obviously, but that’s when 
you start having beat writers and everybody start writing things about multiple failed drug tests (at Florida).”
Once Hernandez left Gainesville 
he wasn’t Meyer’s responsibility anymore.
He was a Patriot, back home 
playing in the city he grew up in — Bristol, Connecticut.
The home of ESPN and Outside 
the Lines, and the home of gangs that Hernandez was often linked 
with.
All Meyer could do was give 
Patriots coach Bill Belichick a few 
words of warning about Hernan-
dez, words that now must be con-
sidered a severe understatement of what Hernandez is capable of.
“Very honest, I just said, ‘You 
just need to keep an eye on him,’” 
Meyer said. “Unfortunately you 
can’t lock them up and keep them away from their homeboys. I guess that’s what happened.”

The Florida softball team has lost arguably 
one of its most important pieces to the team.
Assistant coach Kenny Gajewski has ac-
cepted the head coaching job at Oklahoma 
State after three seasons with the Gators.
Gajewski came to Florida after he was the 
director of baseball operations at Tennessee from 2011-12 and was also a teammate of coach Tim Walton at the University of Oklaho-ma. Both were members of the 1994 national championship baseball team.
Walton brought Gajewski to Gainesville 
three years ago to help the team’s fundamen-tals and defense. Gajewski had an instant im-pact on the team as UF posted then the highest ﬁ  elding percentage in the program’s history in his ﬁ  rst season (.979). The Gators posted a .978 ﬁ  elding percentage in 2014 en route to their ﬁ  rst national title. In 2015, UF notched the highest ﬁ  elding percentage in school his-tory (.981) and a second national title.
“I really can’t wait to get started,” Gajewski 
said in a release. “We are all aware of the his-tory and tradition of Oklahoma State softball and that certainly played a part in my initial interest. After visiting (the) campus and spend-
ing time with the people at Oklahoma State, 
I realized it was a better situation than I had even imagined.
“It’s a part of the country that is obviously 
very important to my family. It’s a destination job for us.” Walton couldn’t say enough about the im-
pact Gajewski had on the team during his three 
seasons as an assistant coach.
“Really excited for Kenny and his whole 
family,” Walton said in a release. “This is a 
great opportunity for him to make softball his life. He is full of passion, energy and truly a great person.
“Oklahoma State is getting a great coach. 
He really helped us in the process of develop-ing our fundamentals and taking our game to 
another level. I’m genuinely excited for him 
and appreciate all he did for us during his time at Florida.” UF assistant coach Kenny Gajewski leaves for Ok. State
“It's a part of the country that is 
obviously very important to my family. 
It's a destination job for us.”

other saw its ﬁ  nal push for a na-tional title begin. The Florida track and ﬁ  eld teams left Eugene, Or-egon, this weekend ﬁ  nishing sec-ond (men’s) and eighth (women’s) in the four-day NCAA champion-ships. Each of UF’s squads picked up two individual titles, with the women’s team taking home the 4x100 and 4x400-meter relay titles and the men’s team taking home the long jump and triple jump titles behind the work of senior Marquis Dendy.
While the track team’s season 
ends, the baseball team has just be-gun its journey through the College World Series. The Gators opened play in Omaha, Nebraska, with a 15-3 rout of Miami on Saturday, highlighted by an 11-run fourth in-ning to seal the win.

Editor’s Note: Because the UF-Virginia game 
was still being played at press time, statistics 
in this story are accurate through Florida’s 15-3 win against Miami on Saturday.
A quartet of UF baseball players is slated 
to join the USA Baseball Collegiate National team this Summer.
Pitchers Logan Shore and A.J. Puk, center 
fielder Buddy Reed and catcher/designated hitter JJ Schwarz will join the 24-player team once they finish play at the College World Series, UF announced Sunday.
“We are very proud that Logan, A.J., JJ 
and Buddy were selected to play on Team USA,” UF coach Kevin O’Sullivan said in a release. “It is a tremendous honor for them to represent our country and will be an expe-rience of a lifetime for them.” 
The sophomore duo of Shore and Puk has 
carried the Gators’ pitching staff all season, providing Florida with one of the most effec-tive one-two punches in collegiate baseball 
since the start of the postseason. Shore has 
10 wins — a mark UF hasn’t seen from one pitcher since Hudson Randall earned 11 wins in 2011 — and Puk is close behind with nine.
Each has accomplished the feat in differ-
ent fashion.
Shore, the righty who’s been in the week-
end rotation practically since he stepped foot on campus, leads the Gators’ staff with 106 innings pitched and has tossed two complete games this season.
Puk, the 6-foot-7 lefty, provides the pow-
er and quickly finds the strike zone.He has a team-best 99 strikeouts in just 
72.2 innings of work. Puk is one strikeout from becoming Florida’s first pitcher with triple-digit strikeouts since 2007 (Bryan Au-
genstein, 105), and his 12.26 strikeouts per 
nine innings ranks second in school history only to John Burke in 1990 (13.25).
Reed, also a sophomore, has been a rock 
for the Gators in center field, making web-gem plays on an almost routine basis. 
He’s committed just two errors on de-
fense and leads the Gators with a career-high 84 hits.
Schwarz, the NCBWA Freshman Hit-
ter of the Year, leads Florida in home runs (18, also the school’s freshman record), RBIs (73), doubles (16) and slugging percentage (.649).
The Palm Beach Gardens native has also 
been named to four All-America teams (D1 Baseball – second-team; NCBWA and Base-ball America – third-team; Collegiate Base-
ball – Freshman team).
The USA Baseball Collegiate National 
Team will play 17 games spanning from June 
20-July 8.
The college team’s tour concludes with 
the Americas Baseball Festival — a four-team round-robin tournament between the USA Baseball Pan American Games Team, the Canadian Senior National Team, the Cu-
ban National Team and the USA Baseball

For the third national meet in a 
row, the Florida men’s track and 
field team finished runner-up to Oregon.
And again, as was the case in 
March’s National Indoor Champi-onships in Fayetteville, Arkansas, the Ducks beat the top-ranked Gators.
But this time the Ducks captured 
the outdoor title at their home track in Eugene, Oregon.
While the two schools are neck-
and-neck in the USTFCCCA’s most recent men’s national poll, sepa-
rated by less than a point, Oregon 
continued its head-to-head domi-
nance against the 
Gators. 
After win-
ning last year’s 
national outdoor 
championship 
— the program’s 
first since 1984 — by just 18 
team-points, the Ducks cruised past 
second-place Florida by a 29-team-
point margin (85-56).
Senior Marquis Dendy won the 
men’s team’s only two individual 
titles.However, despite the fact that 
losing to the same school three con-secutive meets can be frustrating, 
coach Mike Holloway is holding the 
same, positive attitude about his 
team that he’s held all season. 
“We hang our hats on the fact 
that dating back to 2009, so 16 meets in a row, we’ve finished in 
the top 3 as a team,” Holloway said 
in a release.  “I think that’s a phe-
nomenal run and it’s not one we’re 
looking to see end anytime soon.”
The 13th-year head coach isn’t 
taking anything away from the 
Gators’ performance this weekend 
on both the men’s and women’s 
side.The final day of the NCAA Out-
doors began with a victory in the first track event for the No. 6 wom-
en, the 4x100-meter relay.
Robin Reynolds, Shayla Sanders, 
Destinee Gause and Kyra Jefferson 
willed the Gators to its first national 
win in the event in program his-
tory, clocking a 42.92-second mark.
“I feel that we set a good tempo 
for our team.” Gause said in a re-
lease.
The final race, the 4x400 relay, 
ended Florida’s meet on a high note with a 3:28.12-minute performance 
to clinch the title, the women’s first 
since 1992.
Although she did not win her lone individual event, Jefferson 
was able to break her own school record in the 200-meter sprint with a 22.24-second performance. Her mark also stands at No. 6 in the world.
Jefferson was arguably Florida’s 
best women’s performer on the weekend, as she took part in both of the championship relay squads — anchoring the final leg of the 4x100 — to complement her school record in the 200.
“On the 4x4, Claudia (Francis) 
and I weren’t happy with our open races,” Jefferson said. “So we really had to make sure we gave it our all and came together for the 4x4.” UF wins four individual events at NCAA ChampionshipsJavier Fernandez / Courtesy to the Alligator
