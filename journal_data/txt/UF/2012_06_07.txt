It all started when the run-
ning shoes began to pile up in 
Jillian Roberts’ closet.
Now, Roberts is a part of 
the international 8,000-member team that will carry the Olym-pic torch through the U.K. and end at the opening ceremony July 27.
As a cross-country and track 
runner at Miami’s Coral Reef High School, Roberts, a 19-year-old UF communication sciences and disorders sophomore, ran right through her blue Asics sneakers.
But the pile in the back of her 
closet ﬁ  ve years ago has grown to 8,700, which is the number of shoes she has collected and do-nated to One World Running, a Boulder, Colo.-based project that collects and cleans shoes for the world’s shoeless.
“Any shoe,” Roberts said. 
“You name it, I’ve collected it.”
She said 
she got new s n e a k e r s about every 
six months but didn’t want to trash the old pairs. One day , she said, she 
wondered why she didn’t col-lect her old shoes for those who are less fortunate.UF sophomore

Wednesday was one of Bro-
ward Pool’s busiest days of the 
summer so far, but only one Gator was allowed to swim in the pool.
That’s because Ryan Lochte, 
a 27-year-old UF alumnus and six-time Olympic medalist, and a production company used the pool to ﬁ  lm part of a commercial sponsored by AT&T.
Lochte, who stars in the com-
mercial, sprang from a starting block and disappeared beneath the water’s surface. 
Production crew members 
used rain barrels to create waves in the pool, which was lined with special-effects material to darken its water.Location Manager Alan Levi 
declined to com-
ment on how the commercial would use spe-cial effects or if it would involve Lochte’s prepa-rations for the London 2012 
Summer Olympics.“I don’t want to give the story 
away,” he said.
Levi said he doesn’t know 
when the commercial will be aired.
Production took place Mon-
day through Wednesday, and Broward pool will reopen to stu-dents Friday. 
Levi said Broward Pool was 
chosen over other UF pools be-cause of its small size.
Devin McDaniel, a 19-year-old 
marketing sophomore, stopped to watch the production of the commercial.
“I was just running and 
thought it was interesting,” she said. “It’s cool that [Lochte’s] coming back here to shoot a com-mercial before the Olympics.”

Shands Hospital for Children at UF ranked 
signiﬁ  cantly higher compared to previous 
years in the 2012-2013 U.S. News’ pediatric hospital rankings.
The rankings were separated into specialty programs, and seven of Shands’ pediatric pro-grams made the list.
U.S. News recognized six pediatric pro-
grams at Shands last year and only one pro-gram in 2010, Scott Rivkees, chairman of the department of pediatrics at UF’s College of Medicine, said.
Shands ranked No. 13 for diabetes and en-
docrinology , No. 24 for cardiology and heart surgery and No. 26 for gastroenterology.
Those were the highest rankings in Flori-
da.
Shands Hospital for Children has 150 beds 
and sees about 30,000 outpatient emergency room visits a year, Rivkees said.
U.S. News ranked Boston Children’s Hos-
pital and the Children’s Hospital of Philadel-phia the highest. The Boston hospital has about twice as many beds and visits, and Philadel-phia has about three times as many as Shands, according to numbers from U.S. News.
Hospitals are ranked by the number of pa-
tients seen, the reputation of the institution, infection control, the nursing staff and criteria for each speciality.
“For programs that are our size, we are 
among the top, if not the top, program in the United States,” Rivkees said.

Ray Bradbury, author of ‘Fahren-heit 451,’ dies
LOS ANGELES — Ray Brad-
bury anticipated iPods, interactive 
television, electronic surveillance and live, sensational media events, including televised police pursuits — and not necessarily as good things.
The science fiction-fantasy “The Martian Chronicles” 
prophesied the banning of books, especially works of fantasy, a theme Bradbury would take on fully in the 1953 release, “Fahr -
enheit 451.” Inspired by the Cold War, the rise of television and the author’s passion for libraries, it was an apocalyptic narrative of nuclear war abroad and empty pleasure at home with firefighters assigned to burn books instead of putting blazes out (451 degrees Fahrenheit, Bradbury had been told, was the temperature at which texts went up in flames).
In 2007, he received a special 
Pulitzer Prize citation “for his dis-tinguished, prolific and deeply in-fluential career as an unmatched author of science fiction and fanta-sy.” Seven years earlier, he received an honorary National Book Award medal for lifetime achievement, an honor given to Philip Roth and Ar -
thur Miller, among others.
Other honors included an 
Academy Award nomination for an animated film, “Icarus Mont-golfier Wright” and an Emmy for his teleplay of “The Halloween Tree.” His fame even extended to the moon, where Apollo astro-nauts named a crater “Dandelion Crater” in honor of “Dandelion Wine,” his beloved coming-of-age novel. An asteroid was named 9766 Bradbury.
Bradbury is survived by his 
four daughters. Marguerite Brad-bury, his wife of 57 years, died in 2003.
— THE ASSOCIATED PRESSmaster spent his life conjuring such visions from his childhood dreams and Cold War fears, spinning tales of telepathic Mar -
tians, lovesick sea monsters and, in uncanny detail, the high-tech, book-burning future of “Fahren-heit 451.”
“I sometimes get up at night 
when I can’t sleep and walk down into my library and open one of my books and read a paragraph and say , ‘My God, did I write that? Did I write that?’ Be-cause it’s still a surprise,” Brad-bury said in 2000.
Bradbury , who died Tuesday 
night at age 91, was slowed in re-cent years by a stroke that meant he had to use a wheelchair. But he remained active over the years, turning out new novels, plays, screenplays and a volume of poetry.
It was a career he often said 
was inspired by a chance meeting in 1932 with a carnival magician called Mr. Electrico who, at the end of his performance, reached out to the captivated 12-year-old, tapped him with his sword and said, “Live forever!”
Bradbury’s writings ranged 
from horror and mystery to humor and sympathetic sto-ries about the Irish, blacks and Mexican-Americans. Bradbury also scripted John Huston’s 1956 film version of “Moby Dick” and wrote for “The Twilight Zone,” among other television programs, including “The Ray Bradbury Theater,” for which he adapted dozens of his works.
He rose to literary fame in 
1950 with “The Martian Chron-icles,” a series of intertwined stories that satirized capitalism, racism and superpower tensions as it portrayed Earth colonizers destroying an idyllic Martian civilization.

Jillian Roberts’ sister Emily Rob-
erts, a 20-year-old UF communica-
tion sciences and disorders and psychology senior, nominated her sister to be a torchbearer.
She was chosen by Coca-Cola 
to be an American torchbearer.
The company is also sponsoring 
the international Olympic torch re-lay, Coca-Cola spokeswoman Ka-mari Guthrie said.
After Jillian Roberts mentioned 
the contest to her family, Emily Roberts said she wanted to write her little sister’s nomination.
In March, Jillian Roberts 
checked her mailbox at Hume Hall. She said she jumped and ran around the dorm when she read the letter that told her she was among 22 Americans to bear the torch, in-cluding ice skater Michelle Kwan and swimmer Summer Sanders, both former Olympians.
Emily Roberts said her sister 
called her and they screamed over the phone together.
Jillian Roberts will run with 
the Olympic torch for 300 meters, which is about three and a half football ﬁ  elds long, on July 10 in Slough, England, a town between Oxford and London.
Coca-Cola will pay for the sis-
ters to stay in Oxford July 9 to 11.
Jillian Roberts said she remem-
bers crowding around the living room television at home with her sisters, younger brother and par-ents to watch the Olympics ever since she was young and can’t wait to experience it ﬁ  rsthand.“I still am in shock. Like, this is 
for real,” Jillian Roberts said. “It’s something that I am only going to be able to do once in my life, and I’m going to look back on my past in 20 or 30 years from now and feel proud of myself.”4, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, JUNE 7, 2012

The U.S. Department of En-
ergy has awarded $800,000 to 
UF’s nuclear engineering pro-gram for a three-year program to study new technology for fuel rods.
The money is part of a $19.9 
million investment by the gov-ernment to fund nuclear fuel cycle research. 
Thirty-two other universi-
ties were selected for grants, including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Case Western Reserve Univer-sity.
James S. Tulenko, professor 
emeritus in the nuclear engi-neering program and principal investigator of the project, said the money will let the depart-ment establish a three-year program to study the use of diamond nanoparticles on fuel rods.
“The money will allow us to 
employ two full-time graduate assistants and two undergrad-uate assistants,” Tulenko said.
The diamond nanoparticles, 
which Tulenko said are inex-pensive and readily available, could increase the power gen-erated by nuclear plants, lead to safer fuel rods and reduce gaseous ﬁ  ssion emissions.
Also, diamonds are a stable 
material and can help cool the nuclear fuel.
“We’ll get more power from 
the rods for basically the same price,” he said.
If his research is success-
ful, Tulenko said, it could show ways that past nuclear accidents could have been pre-vented.
“It potentially could have 
avoided the Three Mile Island accident,” he said.

During his childhood in Jacksonville, Nikhil 
Joshi was a Miami Dolphins fan. Now, his two kids 
are growing up to be Jaguars supporters.
Joshi, a UF alumnus, brought son Arjun, 9, and 
daughter Neelam, 5, to the Gainesville stop on the Jacksonville Jaguars Caravan Tour on Wednesday.
“It’s an amazing feeling as a dad … we’re just 
happy,” Joshi said. “When they grow up, they’ll re-alize the magnitude of this.”
Former Gators football players Fred Taylor, Jer -
emy Mincey and head coach Mike Mularkey were among the Jaguars to sign autographs and take pic-tures with fans.
New owner Shahid Khan launched the Jaguars 
Caravan to rally support for the franchise in South Georgia and North Florida.
“Jacksonville itself is a small city compared to 
most NFL cities, so we need to regionalize,” Joshi said. “I’m really heartened to see the new owner is making this effort.”
The event featured raffles for prizes from auto-
graphed memorabilia to game tickets.
“My favorite part is that the jaguar is riding a 
motorcycle right now,” Neelam said.

A UF mental health team will launch a new online 
treatment for anxiety in the fall.
The program, offered by the UF Counseling and 
Wellness Center, will be pilot-tested and compared 
with more traditional treatments such as face-to-face and group therapy.
The most common reason for students to withdraw 
from college is mental health problems, UF psychology professor Laurie Mintz said.
On average, students wait four to six weeks to be-
gin treatment at UF. The online program will eliminate patients’ waiting time by one-third to one-half.
“The most important thing is that students get good treatment,” said Sherry Benton, director of the center. “But being on a waiting list is hardly good treatment.”
The program consists of seven sessions and takes 
seven to 10 weeks to complete. Each session includes assessments, videos and exercises.
Patients will have access to an online support group 
through chat rooms monitored by a therapist. During each session, therapists will review assignments and conduct a 10- to 15-minute phone call or video chat consultation with each patient.
Treatment is open to any UF student suffering from 
anxiety. Interested students should contact the Coun-seling and Wellness Center.
If the program is successful, Mintz said the team 
will further research online therapy for other mental health issues, such as depression and eating disorders.UF Counseling and Wellness Center

treatment program?
119 TOTAL VOTES72% YES
28% NOTuesday’s question: Are you going to eat at Satchel’s when it reopens? Well, this week was certainly more tame than last 
week.
No one’s face was eaten off, no one threw their intes-
tines at police and it appears as though no one was caught 
eating someone else’s vital organs.
In fact, all we heard about was some boring election 
in Wisconsin in which nothing changed. Oh yeah, this, of course, brings us to this week’s aw-man-looks-like-no-zombie-apocalypse-after-all-but-the-year-2012-is-only-halfway-over edition of...
Darts & Laurels
First, we must ask the question: Are people really that 
stupid?
Because the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
had to issue a statement denying the existence of zombies or a zombie apocalypse, we throw a man-reading-the-news-is-really-hard DART at people.
Come on, people.Although it’s entertaining to talk about, there’s no zom-
bie apocalypse.
Speaking of brains, we give a common-sense-1-prying-
politicians-0 LAUREL to the Florida Department of Trans-
portation for refusing to lower the speed limit on Interstate 75 through Paynes Prairie, despite pleas from Gainesville and Alachua County commissioners.
Speed was not the problem; heavy smoke caused the 
crash in the spring.
It’s not rocket science.Sometimes, things don’t go according to plan. That’s 
why we’re throwing a you’re-doing-it-wrong DART at 
Charles Estell, who was found stuck in an air duct after attempting to steal $100,000 from a Chicago bank vault.
Estell will probably cut back on the sweets before at-
tempting his next heist.
For some more somber news, we give a thank-you-for-
making-us-think-about-books-and-censorship LAUREL to 
Ray Bradbury, author of “Fahrenheit 451” and “The Mar-tian Chronicles,” among other books.
Bradbury died Tuesday at the age of 91.Tuesday evening, Venus could be seen crossing in front 
of the face of the sun, a rare cosmic spectacle that won’t happen for another 105 years. 
That’s why we’re giving a guess-we’ll-have-to-wait-un-
til-the-year-2117-to-watch-a-tiny-black-dot-cross-the-sun DART at the weather.
What the hell, rain? Cut us some slack so we can look at 
cool space stuff.
Finally, we give a you-should-probably-make-a-special-
ty-pizza-called-the-phoenix LAUREL to Satchel’s Pizza, 
which announced it would be reopening on June 14.
A kitchen ﬁ  re caused Satchel’s to close about four

Best of luck on your reopening.
Howard Zinn, hate mail and ponytails
One of the really stimulating things about writing this 
column is the fact that I receive scathing critiques from people of differing views on everything from 
my thoughts and ideas to my personal character and any-thing else imaginable. Every now and then, somebody puts forth something so ripe for exposition that I can’t resist a re-sponse.
In this case, I’m reminded of the scene in “Good Will 
Hunting” where Matt Damon is upbraiding a condescend-ing, pony-tailed history student in a bar for trying to show others how smart he is by making someone else feel stupid. It was a marvelous scene.
In both that excellent ﬁ  lm and the recent diatribe of my lat-
est angry critic, the author Howard Zinn is glowingly cited. Obviously , as an “unenlightened” conservative, I couldn’t possibly know anything of the great Zinn. He is, however, one of my favorite subjects. He’s a progressive hero of great renown and an utter failure as a historian.
Zinn is most famous for his hugely successful volume “A 
People’s History of the United States”, which has sold more than a million copies and has been taught in countless class-rooms in high schools and universities since its original pub-lication in 1980. Most students have probably been exposed to it at some point.
“A People’s History” positively drips with a deep-seated 
hatred for all things American, placing the country simulta-neously at the center of the moral universe while also blam-ing her for nearly every ailment of humanity since her found-ing. Naturally, Zinn has been lionized by the radical left for writing what may be the most widely read Marxist indoctri-nation tract ever circulated.
As an example of what I mean by calling him a failure 
as a historian, I’ve gathered some of the quotes of his own left-leaning peers regarding his work — actual historians still hewing the mark of facts over agenda.
Of Zinn, Arthur Schlesinger Jr. remarked, “I don’t take 
him very seriously. He’s a polemicist, not a historian.”In his review of “‘A People’s His-
tory” in “The American Scholar,’” Harvard professor Oscar Handlin denounced “the deranged quality of his fairy tale, in which the inci-dents are made to ﬁ  t the legend, no matter how intractable the evidence of American history.”
Even socialist Georgetown histo-
rian Michael Kazin declared “‘A People’s History’ is bad his-tory, albeit gilded with virtuous intentions. Zinn reduces the past to a Manichean fable,” while maintaining Zinn’s narra-tive “is grounded in a premise better suited to a conspiracy-monger’s website than to a work of scholarship.”
Zinn, in his own words, stated, “I got into history because 
I was already an activist at the age of 18 … So when I began to study history and began to think about being a teacher and writing history , I already understood that I was not going to be a neutral teacher. I was not going to simply be a scholar… I wanted my writing of history and my teaching of history to be a part of social struggle”
Answering accusations of intellectual dishonesty, Zinn 
declared, “Objectivity is impossible and it is also undesir-able.”
While I’m not surprised at this man’s popularity in cer-
tain quarters, I take issue with “the great man” being called a historian. Call him what he really was: an activist, dissident and liar.
Apparently, teaching ideology over facts, lying to mil-
lions and using patent falsehoods to indoctrinate hatred of one’s own country can net you fortune, fame and a huge ce-lebrity cult following while also providing ample ammo for angry, pony-tailed Alligator letters.

Ombudsmen seek positive change for 
Florida’s long-term care facility residents
I wish to bring to your attention inaccurate 
information that has been floating around re-
garding the operation of the Long-Term Care Ombudsman Program and the work of the program’s 300-plus volunteers.
Some of you may be aware of two recent 
opinion pieces that ran in the Treasure Coast Palm, titled “Families Feel Powerless Against Elder Abuse” and “Our Seniors are at Even Greater Risk.” I would like to clarify some in-formation written in these opinion pieces.
The duties, responsibilities and advocacy 
work of the program has not changed. Om-budsman volunteers continue to protect the health, safety, welfare and rights of residents living in long-term care facilities. Our office re-ceives numerous letters of thanks for the work performed by our ombudsmen. One letter stated, “As mediators and problem-solvers, they have been invaluable. Thanks to their ef-forts, the lives of our loved ones are better.”
It would be a shame if that fine work was 
stained by inaccurate information in an at-tempt to derail our program.
There are more than 168,000 beds in Flor -
ida’s long-term care facilities with residents served by countless donated hours of our self-less volunteer ombudsmen. Since May 2011, our volunteer numbers have increased 25 per -
cent statewide and have remained steady over the past year. In the Treasure Coast District, which serves Martin, St. Lucie, Indian River and Okeechobee counties, ombudsmen vol-unteer numbers are up by 200 percent.
As always, when we receive complaints, 
we respond. Statewide, this office received more than 7,873 complaints this year. Volun-teers donated more than 21,532 hours on com-plaint investigations.
And the year is far from over.Since the Long-Term Care Ombudsman 
Program was founded in 1975, our mission has always focused on the real issues that af-fect Florida’s elders: neglect, abuse, scams, age discrimination, residents’ rights, exploitation, safety and welfare. Through the ongoing ef-forts of our ombudsmen, the State Long-Term Care Ombudsman’s participation and repre-sentation in the Governor’s Assisted Living Facility (ALF) Workgroup and in the ALF negotiated rulemaking meetings, we will tire-lessly persist in our efforts to bring about posi-tive change for Florida’s long-term care facility residents.
If you need help or would like to submit 
a complaint on behalf of a loved one living in a long-term care facility, or if you have ques-tions or want more information about the work and accomplishments of the Ombuds-man Program, I encourage you to call us at 1-888-831-0404 or visit http://www.ombuds-man.myflorida.com.

City Mayor Michael Bloomberg for not supporting the bill, sug-gesting he must obviously “favor businesses than regular work-ing-class people.”
Like Martinazzi, most Americans tend to view the minimum 
wage as a necessary instrument to prevent the soulless corporation from exploiting the helpless, innocent poor and improve the living standards of low-wage earners, and thereby contribute to a reduc-tion in poverty.
But is this an accurate and honest portrayal of the issue?A closer look at the minimum wage reveals that it is unassum-
ingly destructive in nature.
The folly in the legislation of wage rates can be seen based on 
simple logic and common sense reasoning.
With the institution of a $10 minimum wage, individuals whose 
skills are not sufficient to justify that compensation will naturally become unemployed. By law, employers will be required to dis-criminate against those who have little skill, experience and/or education.
History has shown that increases in the minimum wage have 
consistently priced out the most vulnerable workers, namely Af-rican-Americans, teenagers, women and workers with developing skills whose labor is not yet equivalent to what the law requires they be paid. This penalizes the very individuals the minimum 
wage is theoretically intended to benefit.
A low minimum wage creates incen-
tives for employers to take chances on low-skill workers, thereby allowing them the opportunity to gain experience, per -
haps learn a trade, earn some money and 
increase capital in themselves. When the minimum wage escalates, the employer, the consumer and the worker must all sacrifice.
Employers can elect to pass the increased price in labor to the 
customer, thereby remaining loyal to the employee but risk losing business. Employers can cut positions and staff hours, thereby rais-ing unemployment, decreasing business productivity, and com-promising customer service. Another option available to employ-ers is to replace low-skilled workers with those who possess skills that justify the higher wages, thereby compounding the difficulty for low-income, low-skilled workers to locate employment.
Advocating increases in the minimum wage offers a sexy talk-
ing point for politicians eager to appear united with the little guy . I admit, advocates of minimum-wage policies may have their hearts in the right place, but policies cannot be judged exclusively on the intentions of their sponsors.
What proponents of the minimum wage increasingly fail to re-
alize is that a law cannot artificially make a worker worth more than he is simply by making it illegal to pay him less than a certain amount.

Upon picking up this newspaper and glimpsing at 
the name of this article, most readers will think: Who on Earth is Diego Garcia? But the real ques-
tion is not who but where on Earth is Diego Garcia?
The answer lies in the Indian Ocean, in a chain of is-
lands known as the Chagos Archipelago. Neighbored by 52 other tropical islands, Diego Garcia owes its name to a Portuguese navigator and was once a territory of Mauritius.
So what is it that’s so special about this island in the 
middle of the Indian Ocean?
Besides its reputation for natural beauty, Diego Gar -
cia is the home of one of the most unknown and repul-sive injustices committed in the 20th century.
In 1965, the British government purchased the Cha-
gos islands, and a year later, an agreement was made between the U.K. and the United States for an unpopu-lated island in the Indian Ocean to serve as a naval air base.
However appetizing this new military base may 
have sounded to westerners during the Cold War, there were other people who found this Anglo-American deal anything but exciting.
In order for the Americans to begin the transforma-
tion of Diego Garcia into a naval air base, the British were tasked with “sanitizing” the island of its indig-enous population.
An ordinance was passed by the Foreign Office main-
taining that all natives must leave the island. As a result, many Chagossians who left in order to work in neigh-boring islands were denied re-entry to their homeland. British forces began employing scare tactics in hopes of getting the rest of the natives off the island.
When these tactics failed, the occupiers resorted to 
even more heinous alternatives. About 1,000 pets were rounded up, namely dogs, and slaughtered by way of carbon monoxide poisoning.
The remaining population 
was loaded onto ships and sent to the Seychelles or Mauritius.
What did the U.K. stand to 
gain from such crimes? In exchange for depopulating of Diego Garcia, the U.K. received a discount on the Polaris nuclear weapons system it purchased from the U.S.
Since these atrocities were committed, only £650,000 
of compensation have been awarded to the victims who remain refugees in the Seychelles and Mauritius.
As a native of Great Britain, I am highly ashamed 
that our government would ever commit such crimes against not just human beings, but its own citizens, and even more so have the audacity to deny that any laws were ever broken in the process.
As a human being, I would like to think that we are all 
equal, but the harsh reality is that we live in a world that abides by a double standard. This is true, because if ever a plane full of Frenchmen were to arrive in Gainesville and try to tell the natives to leave, they would be met by an army of Floridians who would be more than happy to tell them where to put their croissants.
Between 1967 and 1973, almost 2,000 people were in-
voluntarily relocated because the British and American governments believed their agendas were more impor -
tant than the livelihood of the Chagossian people. To this day, the naval base is still present in Diego Garcia and has been used to deploy fighter jets that would bomb countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan.
As citizens of the U.S. and the U.K., we must treat 
such actions by our governments with contempt and disgust. We must also recognize that when it comes to the lives and homes of human beings, the ends never justify the means.

ganic Farms, sell produce at the Union Street Farmers Market Wednesday afternoon.

The double-wide trailer was part of the dream.
Its exterior was browned from exposure, and 
some of the windows were covered with duct-taped plastic.
Piles of PVC pipes and wood sat nearby, wait-
ing to be fashioned into something useful.
The rest of the eight acres boasted neat rows of 
vegetables at all stages of growth.
Even if only one leaf was poking out of the 
ground, Jose Landrua could identify it.
“These are dandelion greens,” he said. “They’re 
really good for liver detox if you have jaundice — or if you drank too much.”
It seems like he’s been farming for decades. But 
Jose Landrua isn’t even 30, and he didn’t know anything about farming until he moved to Alachua County this January.
The 23-year-old said he needed a change from 
his life in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
As a high school dropout, he worked odd jobs 
after he and his brother moved to Fort Lauderdale in 2007, including a stint as a commercial sword-fish fisherman.
He decided to start an organic farm and called 
his 21-year-old brother, Javier Landrua, to come join him, though neither had any experience.
“It’s the hardest, best thing I’ve ever done,” Jose  
Landrua said.
He said he’s found his calling, but Jose Landrua 
wasn’t always sure what he wanted to become.
Jose Landrua made his first trip to Gainesville 
to visit a friend. He found a community that per -
suaded him to make the move permanent.
He asked his brother to quit his job and move 
to Alachua to help him start an organic farm. Javier Landrua, who was working as a deliveryman in Tallahassee, jumped at the opportunity.
“I was waiting for him to come up with some-
thing great for us to do,” Javier Landrua said.
Jose  Landrua got in contact with a local farmer 
who was planning on leaving his farm near Ala-chua in the next few months. The farmer, whom Jose Landrua declined to name, offered to show him the ropes.
Jose Landrua said when he first arrived, the 
farm looked like a Third World country.
Jose Landrua said the farmer gave misleading 
instructions. He withheld money and a list of peo-ple who paid for shares of the crop.
Left with a disheveled field and no idea whom 
he owed, Jose Landrua felt like he hit rock bottom.
Enter Chuck Crawford.He stopped by the farm in February and saw 
the shambles left for the Landrua brothers. Craw-ford decided he needed to help.
“They were screwed,” he said. “I knew the old 
farmer, and I knew he wasn’t doing it right.”
Crawford, 52, an experienced farmer, spent an 
entire night helping the brothers weed their field.
A few nights later, the brothers huddled un-
der their shared bed sheet, shivering around a fire when Crawford came to check on them. The next night, Crawford brought six handmade quilts.
“He was such a blessing,” Jose Landrua said, 
wiping away tears. “I don’t know what we would have done without him.”           
“They’re like my kids,” Crawford said. “I wasn’t 
going to let anybody freeze.”
Eventually , Jose Landrua compiled a small list 
of those who paid for crop shares after a few weeks vending at the Union Street Farmers Market.
The brothers are scraping by but happy.Jose Landrua smiles as he plants leaves that will 
soon mature into peppers. He said he feels a per -
sonal connection to the land he works.
“This whole experience has opened my eyes,” 
Jose Landrua said. “I feel like I married it.”

In 2011 a group of Gainesville 
residents came together with a com-
mon goal: support the local food economy . 
The Citizens Co-op was born, and 
one way it fulfills its goal is by host-ing a farmers market Sundays from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. behind the store.
“Our intent from the start has 
been to offer as much local food as possible,” Kathy Whipple, 46, one of the managers of the co-op, said.
There were vendors who were 
selling their food inside the co-op, Whipple said, but when the agricul-ture inspector came through, a lot of the vendors didn’t have permits to sell food there.
“So in order to offer them an out-
let, we decided to hold the farmers market once a week in the back-yard,” Whipple said.
The farmers market has a variety 
of vendors and musicians who per -
form throughout the afternoon.
Kitty Moss, 34, from Cloudwalk-
er Farms in Lake City , had a stand that featured empanadas and flan made with duck eggs.
“Duck eggs make everything 
fluffier,” Moss said.
Those who are allergic to chicken 
eggs can eat duck eggs. The duck eggs are easier to digest than chick-en eggs and nutritious for chemo-therapy patients, Moss said.Moss, who is working on her As-
sociate of Arts in agriculture at Santa Fe College, wants to start breeding certain types of livestock that are on the verge of becoming extinct, called heritage animals.
She also wants to expand to 
growing produce using heirloom seeds, which are the plant equiva-lent of heritage animals, Moss said.Next to Moss is the Hoggtowne 
Lemonade Co., operated by Adam Streifel, 27, and Rachel Valencia, 27.
The stand has gourmet lemon-
ade flavors ranging from blueberry lavender to strawberry chocolate mint to classic lemonade.
The company began with Streifel 
concocting lemonades with nutri-tious ingredients to help Valencia eat healthier with her busy schedule.
“We wanted an alternative to 
soda and sweet tea,” Valencia said.
The pair brought their lemonade 
to the Citizens Co-op’s market dur -
ing the Hogtown HomeGrown 2012 Eat Local Challenge in May.
“Farmers markets are bringing 
back the whole community feel to people,” Streifel said.Oak Hollow Cottage is beside the 
lemonade stand, with husband and wife Mike McCarthy , 48, and Pat McCarthy, 54, of Hawthorne.
The stand features jams, sauces, 
marinades, butters, rice mixes and homemade jewelry by Pat McCa-rthy.
The couple worked together at 
a cafe in Lansing, Mich. The McCa-rthys modified their cooking meth-ods and ingredients to combat Mike McCarthy’s diabetes.
In the last five years, Mike McCa-
rthy lost 80 pounds.
Seasonal fruit is a focus for the 
McCarthys’ recipes.
“When it’s gone, it’s gone until 
next year,” Pat McCarthy said.
The cottage’s most popular item 
is the tangerine turbinado.
“The tangerine offers a complex 
flavor,” Pat McCarthy said, “and turbinado is a less refined sugar.”
Circling around beside the stage 
is Elizabeth Dionisi, 51, from Alba-nia. Her stand offers Greek food, including eggplant with feta cheese, baklava and grape leaves.
Past Dionisi is the Citizens Co-
op store, where Whipple works to achieve the farmers market’s goal.
“It helps us because it attracts 
people,” Whipple said, “and it helps the vendors have a low-cost place to sell their goods.”
It costs $5 to have a stand in the 
farmers market, and vendors can apply on the website.
“It has turned out to be something 
of an incubator,” Whipple said. “It’s one of the ways that we are building the local food economy.”

When Kim Kruse was a child, 
her grandmother would sew 
clothing for her and her sister.
Last weekend, the now 37-year-
old closed her sewing studio, Sew Make Do and began preparing garments for a child of her own.
About 10 times a month, UF 
students and Gainesville residents filled the 600-foot brick and mor -
tar sewing studio. At the six sew-ing stations inside, they learned to sew, knit and quilt.
“It’s nice to have a place where 
[people] feel like they can get to-gether,” she said.
Kruse, a UF employee, opened 
Sew Make Do in October 2011. For the three years prior to Sew Make Do opening she taught classes through the Alachua County Li-brary District and UF Leisure Course program.
Kruse was tired of transport 
ing heavy sewing equipment to the classes she taught. She used to have to teach in whichever room in the Reitz Union was unoccu-pied, including the basement.
“I wanted to create a welcom-
ing space for people who are in creative classes to come and learn,” she said.
Kruse plans to continue teach-
ing at Chickadee Shops, a fabric store in the Oaks Mall Plaza. She will keep a list of her classes on www.SewMakeDo.com, schedul-ing them around her pregnancy.
“It’s something I chose to do 
because I only have so much time I can dedicate to the things that are important in my life,” she said. “I think that most people would agree family is pretty important.”Sewing studio closes 
after eight months

Man Man, a five-piece, multi-instru-
mental, experimental band from Philadel-
phia will be performing in Gainesville next week. They are known for their bizarre an-tics and energy on stage.
The show is June 13 at Double Down 
Live, which is located at 210 SW Second Ave.
The doors open at 9 p.m. Local band 
Black Box Jungle will start playing around 10 p.m. with Man Man going on just before midnight, said Pat Lavery of Glory Days Presents!
Black Box Jungle is extremely excited to 
share the stage with Man Man. Lavery sent a handful of local music to ANTI- Records booking agents, and Black Box Jungle was selected.
Ryan Michael and Collen Derby of 
Black Box Jungle classified their music as experimental with punk influences.
“It’s an untraditional format,” Michael 
said. “There is no guitar with a lot of dif-ferent effects.” 
Man Man is headlining the show. Its lat-
est album, “Life Fantastic,” came out last summer. It was produced by Mike Mogis, a member of Bright Eyes.  
Lead singer Ryan Kattner, also known as Honus Honus, plays the piano and is accompanied by a diverse mix of instru-ments played by the other members, rang-ing from saxophone and French horn to pots, pans and toys.
According to Kattner, music lovers may 
not get a chance to see the group for a while after this tour.
“Hopefully people come and witness 
what we do,” he said. “Not only are we playing after a long period off, but after this little tour, we’re not going to be tour -
ing for a while. We are just going to be fo-cusing on working on the next record.”
This small East Coast tour is only 17 
days long. It began in Pennsylvania and ends in North Carolina
“The flip side of a short tour is that 
there is a show almost every day. My voice is guaranteed to be smoky and sexy.”
Kattner said the group is already work-
ing on their next album and hopefully it will be out sometime next year.
Q&A With Ryan Kattner
Q: Doing anything interesting 
with your release?
RK: We were actually going to have 
them burned to metal plates.  It’s gonna be cool.  And they’re each gonna come with a little dog.Man Man hasn’t been to Florida in 
about two years, Kattner said. The band hasn’t been to Gainesville in nearly six.  
Q: Can you provide any insight as 
to why bands never tour in Florida?
RK: Because of bath salts..?
Florida jokes aside, one of Kattner’s fa-
vorite venues is The Original Cafe Eleven 
in St. Augustine.
Although the tour only kicked off a 
week ago, Kattner already had a tale or two.
Q: Do you have any good stories 
from this tour yet?
RK: We’ve been playing a lot of small 
rooms that we haven’t played in a long time, so that’s been fun for us, because the energy is a lot different.
Q: A little more intimate?
RK: Yeah, the only downside is that 
kids steal your s--t.
Q: This tour? You got some things 
stolen?
RK: Yes, it is aggravating.  Like the 
other day, someone stole half of my mus-tache.
As well as being a part of Man Man, 
Kattner is a member of Mister Heavenly, a “supergroup” comprised of Joe Plummer from Modest Mouse and The Shins, Nicho-las Thorburn of The Unicorns and Islands, and actor Michael Cera, who was the tour -
ing bassist.
Q: Does anyone else have a side 
project, like you with Mister Heav-
enly?
RK: Yeah we are all doing stuff.  Our 
drummer does a thing called Spaceship 
Aloha.  One of the guys is in a band called Buffalo Stance.  Billy is a sculptor, and an-other member plays in a band called Ex-traordinaires. So we are all really busy.
With all of the members taking on so 
many projects, Kattner said scheduling is difficult.
“This takes precedence with me. It’s my 
baby,” he said.
Tickets are $12 in advance and $14 the 
day of the show. They are available locally with no service fees at Hear Again Music and Movies, located at 201 SE First Street.  They are also available online at www.ticketweb.com.12, ALLIGATOR §  THURSDAY, JUNE 7, 2012

Mike Zunino got the Gators’ 
offense going last Saturday 
night.
Knotted in a 1-1 tie against 
Georgia Tech, Zunino got a fast-ball at belt level to lead off the top of the fourth. Zunino “hit the top of the ball and was able to back-spin it out” for a go-ahead home run to deep center field. 
The junior catcher’s long ball 
spurred 20 UF runs in the next 15 innings.
“It was a big emotional lift for 
us when you’re in the middle of the order like that,” coach Kevin O’Sullivan said. “Mike’s home run was a big emotional lift for our team.”
As the nation’s home-run 
leader with 71 this season, Flori-da boasts one of the nation’s most productive lineups. While NC State ranks second in the Atlan-tic Coast Conference with just 22 homers surrendered this season, the Wolfpack believes their bats will help them keep up with the Gators.
“I know that they’re the No. 
1 team, I know everything about them,” N.C. State coach Elliott Avent said. “We’re as good offen-sively as we’ve been all year.”
Florida did plenty to maintain 
its power-hitting reputation dur -
ing the NCAA Gainesville Re-gional. Zunino hit two home runs during the weekend, including his team-leading 18th Sunday. 
The No. 3 overall pick in the 
2012 MLB Amateur Draft lined a frozen rope to the left-field bleachers to give the Gators a 7-0 lead against the Yellow Jackets in the bottom of the second Sun-day.
“I was looking for a good 
pitch to hit and tried to put a good swing on it,” Zunino said. “It was one of the better, well-hit ones this year.”
Preston Tucker added a home 
run in the top of the ninth last Saturday. With Nolan Fontana on first, Tucker hit a 1-1 pitch to deep right field. His 15th homer of the season crossed Stadium Road in the air and landed at Keys Residential Complex on the UF campus.
Casey Turgeon even took a 
turn as the slugger last weekend. Named the NCAA Gainesville Regional’s Most Outstanding Player, Turgeon’s fourth home run of the season was a three-run shot to put Florida ahead 4-0 Fri-day.
“For anybody on their team to 
go opposite field like that, that’s impressive,” Bethune-Cookman coach Jason Beverlin said Friday. “For [Turgeon] to do it, it’s very impressive. It really is. That’s as good as he’s going to hit a ball. There’s no doubt.”
While the Gators’ strength 
comes from their power bats, they showed they could manu-facture runs without hitting base-balls over the fence last weekend. Florida scored 16 of its 25 runs on non-homers.
However, the Gators’ most en-
couraging offensive development last weekend was clutch hitting. Florida registered 16 two-out RBI during the weekend, including 11 Sunday.
“With two outs, with this kind 
of lineup we have, you know any-thing can happen,” Tucker said. “Just try to get somebody on. See what happens.”

For the last three years Texas A&M 
has dominated the men’s NCAA Outdoor 
Championships, edging Florida by a com-bined five points. A slow start on the first day of competition Wednesday may prove costly for the Gators should the national title be decided by single digits again.
Florida had five Gators compete in 
preliminary rounds Wednesday. Of those five, only two advanced to the finals – ju-nior Tony McQuay and senior Genevieve LaCaze.
McQuay had a strong start for Florida. He opened up in the 400 meters with a new outdoors personal record, beating his previous time of 44.68, which was set at the USA Championships. 
His first-place finish easily advanced 
him to the finals in the 400m.
“Tony was phenomenal tonight,” 
coach  Mike Holloway  said. “He’s been 
training well and for him to come out and run the fastest time in the NCAA this year and the second-fastest in the U.S., I think it really gave us great momentum to start NCAAs. He works really hard and puts in the effort and today was proof of that.”
As the day went on, the performances 
began to fall short of expectations. Despite finishing third in her heat, 
sprinter Lanie Whittaker placed 10th over -
all in the 400m. She was the first of the three to fall short of qualifying for the fi-nals.
After running a per -
sonal best in the 100 me-ters at the Southeastern Conference Champion-ships for a third place fin-ish, sophomore Darshay 
Davis also fell short at the NCAA Outdoor Champi-onships. Davis finished 
last in the 100m with a time of 11.69.
Although she didn’t advance to the fi-nals, Davis will have a chance to compete again tomorrow in the 200 meters. 
Of all the Gators who didn’t advance to 
the finals, freshman Marquis Dendy was the closest. Dendy’s mark in the long jump was just over an inch short of qualifying for the finals. Like Davis, Dendy will be able to compete again in the NCAA Out-door Championships, this time in the tri-ple jump on Friday.
Senior LaCaze wrapped up the day for 
the Gators on a positive note. The USTFC-CCA South Region Women’s Track Ath-lete of the Year finished ninth overall in 
McQuay, LaCaze only Gators to advance on first day at NCAA Championships

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
JACKSONVILLE — Sitting be-
tween his coach and general manag-
er, Jacksonville Jaguars receiver Jus-tin Blackmon stared at the ground for much of the 18-minute news conference Wednesday . He looked every bit like a kid in trouble.
Blackmon apologized for his 
“poor judgment,” vowed to learn and grow from his latest alcohol-related arrest and insisted he doesn’t have a drinking problem. Nonethe-less, he swore off alcohol for now.
“People are going to think what 
they are going to think,” Blackmon said. “Words are words. It’s my actions that are going to have to show.”
The first-round draft pick was 
arrested during a traffic stop in Stillwater, Okla., early Sunday after a breath test allegedly showed his blood alcohol content to be three times the legal limit. He appeared in an Oklahoma courtroom Monday and pleaded not guilty to a misde-meanor count of driving under the influence. Blackmon was allowed to remain free on $1,000 bond. His next court date is July 24, three days be-fore training camp.
In the meantime, he has plenty of 
work to do to restore his image.
“I just want to apologize and let 
people know that it’s not who I am, that’s not who I’m going to be,” he said.
It was Blackmon’s second alco-
hol-related incident in less than two years. He was arrested on a misde-meanor DUI charge in Texas in 2010 after officers caught him speeding on a suburban Dallas highway. The charge was later reduced to an un-derage alcohol possession charge.
He might not be so lucky this 
time around.
Although jail time is unlikely , 
Blackmon could end up on proba-tion. He also could be suspended by the NFL, and Jaguars general manager Gene Smith said the arrest could affect contract negotiations.Jacksonville traded up to select 
the former Oklahoma State star with the fifth pick in April’s NFL draft.
“At the time that we made the se-
lection, we felt very good about the selection,” Smith said. “And I still do because I feel like I’ve got to take a man for his word. We have a chance to get him right. He’s a young player and he’s got to do his part.”
Blackmon declined to answer 
several questions about that night, citing the pending legal process.
But he made it clear he doesn’t 
feel like he has a drinking problem.
“I do not,” he said. “I just think 
I made a poor choice. I put myself in a bad situation. It’s completely my fault. I’ve just got to make better judgment on that.”
He said he would do whatever 
the league and the Jaguars ask of him. But he added that he’s up for the challenge of getting on the right path and staying there.
“I know they put a lot of pressure 
on me, but I put more pressure on myself to make this right and I’m going to put more pressure on my-self, continue to do that, get out of this situation and to make it right,” he said. “It’s all about growing from your mistakes, learning from them and maturing and trying not to make the same ones over again.”
His big bombshell was that he 
has given up alcohol, at least for now.
“I’m done,” he said. “Right now, 
I’m done with all that. ... I can’t promise you 10 years down the road that I’m going to be done. I just know that as of right now and what I can speak of. I’m looking forward to getting ready to play football and putting this in the past.”THURSDAY, JUNE 7, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 19

� FINAL GAME AS A CAVALIER WAS 
A GAME 6 PLAYOFF LOSS TO CELTICS
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS  
MIAMI — LeBron James appreciates the 
irony.
Matching up against the Boston Celtics, on 
the road, with the season on the line. He faced 
it in 2008 and lost. He faced it in 2010 and lost, removing his Cleveland Cavaliers jersey for the final time as he left the floor that night.
And now in a championship-or-bust sea-
son for the Miami Heat, James heads back to Boston for another win-or-else game.
“It is fitting,” James said.The Celtics lead the Heat 3-2 in the Eastern 
Conference finals, and on Thursday night will look to clinch a third trip in five years to the NBA finals.
If they succeed in Game 6 — or Game 7, if it 
comes to that — all three of those most recent Boston trips to the title round would come at James’ expense.
His first five games at Boston resulted in 
three wins. His 19 games there since have also resulted in three wins.
No team, maybe no other building, has be-
fuddled James as much as the Celtics and the arena they call home.
He’s had a 45-point effort there in a loss, a 
42-point effort there in a loss, a 27-point, 19-re-bound, 10-assist effort there in a loss. Another loss on Thursday, and his ninth season will end as the previous eight did — without a championship.
“I know how much pain this team has giv-
en me over the years,” James said. “So I guess it’s only right that we would be going up there in an elimination game. In order for us to keep our season going, we’ve got to win in their building. So that’s what it’s about.”
It’s no secret that the expectation — both 
internally and externally — for the Heat is to win championships. That’s what James fa-mously vowed to get when he came to Miami in July 2010, and after losing in last season’s finals to Dallas, it’s been the only goal for the Heat in what the team has steadfastly referred to as a no-excuse season.
James won his third MVP award this sea-
son. He’s averaging 29.9 points in the playoffs, six points better than his pace from a year ago and one-tenth of a point away from Kobe Bry-
ant for the league’s post-season lead in that depart-ment. And if Miami loses on Thursday night, the Heat season — and James’ — will go down in most circles as a failure.
“We have to do this to-
gether,” Heat forward Chris Bosh said. “He’s going to do 
what he’s supposed to do, and we’re going to do what we’re supposed to do. We’re going to do it together. We live and die together.
“You can’t just single him out. People have 
to stop doing that. It’s a team sport. If he per -
forms, he’s going to perform, and he’s going to do his job.”
Even with the Heat down in the series after 
a 94-90 home loss the previous night, Wednes-day’s practice in Miami did not have a fune-real mood.
James was chatting and laughing as he shot 
free throws with some teammates toward the end of the workout, not far from where Heat President Pat Riley sat at his customary table to watch the proceedings. Mike Miller and Udonis Haslem teased each other about how much the other read, or didn’t read, while en-rolled at Florida. Mario Chalmers and assis-tant coach David Fizdale were talking about nuances of Boston guard Ray Allen’s game.
“I think we’re all disciplined enough to 
compartmentalize and focus on the challenge that we have ahead of us,” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said.
“It never is easy on your journey to try to be 
an NBA champion. You’ll always have these tough moments where you have to come to-gether and go through that moment together. You can’t skip it. There isn’t an easy way.”

Mike Zunino, Catcher
Chosen by the Seattle Mariners with the No. 3 overall pick,

Brian Johnson, Starting Pitcher/Designated HitterThe southpaw pitcher out of Cocoa Beach, Fla., was selected just 28 picks after Zunino by the Boston Red Sox with the 31st overall pick. Brian John-son has recorded a 3.56 ERA in a team-high 86 innings pitched in 2012. In the batter’s box this season, Johnson is batting .310 with 40 RBI. Zunino and Johnson are the first pair of Gators drafted in the first round since Robby Thompson and Rich Rice in 1983. 
Nolan Fontana, Shortstop
The Houston Astros called Nolan Fontana’s name as the first pick of the second round (61st). Fontana has earned a spot on the Southeastern Confer-ence All-Defensive team for three consecutive seasons. Fontana leads the Gators with 56 runs, 46 walks, a .414 on-base percentage and 13 steals.Steven “Paco” Rodriguez, Relief PitcherWith a team-high 79 strikeouts out of the bullpen, Steven “Paco” Rodriguez at-tracted the attention of the Los Angeles Dodgers at pick No. 82. Rodriguez was force in relief for Florida this season with a 2.08 ERA and a .203 batting average against in a team-high 32 appearances. While filling in for injured closer Austin Maddox in early May, Rodriguez earned four saves.
Third Round
Austin Maddox, Relief PitcherAustin Maddox joined Johnson as a new member of the Red Sox organiza-tion when Boston selected with the 118th overall pick. Maddox was named the SEC Freshman of the Year in 2010 after hitting .333 with 17 home runs and 72 RBI. The last two seasons, Maddox has developed into one of the best relievers in college baseball with a 1.70 ERA and 17 saves.
Preston Tucker, Outfielder
The Houston Astros’ selection of Preston Tucker ended a four-round Gators drought. Tucker was the first Florida senior chosen in this year’s draft. Tucker has set numerous school records during his Gators career, including hits (335) and RBI (254). His 56 home runs rank second on UF’s all-time list behind Matt LaPorta’s 74.Hudson Randall, Starting PitcherThe Detroit Tigers made Hudson Randall their seventh-round selection at pick No. 244. As Florida’s Friday night starter this season, Randall has a 2.83 ERA, a team-high eight victories, a 1.02 WHIP and a 5.7-to-1 strikeout-to-walk ratio. Last season, Randall was an All-American honorable mention by College Baseball Insider after recording 11 wins, a 2.17 ERA and a 0.94 WHIP during the 2011 campaign.
Daniel Pigott, OutfielderAs the Cincinnati Reds’  ninth-round pick, Daniel Pigott was the second UF senior to come off the board. Last year, Pigott went undrafted. The centerfielder leads the Gators with a .321 batting average, and he swiped 11 bases on a team-high 16 attempts this season.
Greg Larson, Relief Pitcher
Greg Larson was drafted in the 20th round as the 631st overall selection. Like Johnson and Maddox, Larson was chosen by the Boston Red Sox. Last year, the Los Angeles Angels took him in the 29th round. After electing to come back for his senior campaign, Larson has a team-best 1.31 ERA in 48 innings pitched. He has yet to surrender a home run in 2012.GATORS SELECTED IN THE 2012 MLB AMATEUR DRAFT
