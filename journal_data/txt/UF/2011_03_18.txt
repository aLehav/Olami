See Story, Page 12.March soreness: Iowa clinic says there’s no better time for a vasectomy 
WEST DES MOINES, Iowa — A West 
Des Moines clinic’s ad campaign hits be-
low the belt by urging sport fans to in-dulge in some alternative March madness: Have a vasectomy on Thursday or Friday then spend the weekend recovering while watching NCAA tournament basketball.
Iowa Clinic marketing executive Jessica 
Grant tells the Des Moines Register that the campaign is designed to appeal to men whose partners want them to get the snip and who complain they spend too much time in front of the TV .
The ad reads, “After your vasectomy: 
Stay on couch. 32 games in two days. Re-turn to work on Monday.”
Urologist Dr. Mark Kellerman says he 
thinks the campaign is “a great idea.”
The clinic performed 102 vasectomies 
in March 2010 when the ads debuted. This month, 129 are scheduled.

TAMPA — After three seasons without an NCAA Tourna-
ment victory , the Gators worked their way back into the win 
column in dominating fashion. 
Second-seeded Florida started hot and never yielded, routing 
No. 15-seed UC Santa Barbara 79-51 on Thursday in the St. Pete Times Forum. 
“It was huge,” senior center V ernon Macklin said. “Us being 
able to come out and get this victory and, most importantly , be able to keep playing. 
The win is UF’s first in the Tournament since 2007, when an 
84-75 over Ohio State victory secured a second straight national title. 
Coach Billy Donovan said the rebuilding process has been 
a journey , as the Gators lost all five starters following the 2006-07 season. 
“It’s been very difficult. It’s been very 
challenging,” Donovan said. “It’s also been very , very rewarding being a part of a group of guys and trying to help them understand what it takes to win at this level and the 
strides that they’ve made from their freshman year until now.”
Seniors Chandler Parsons, Alex Tyus and Macklin each re-
corded their first NCAA Tournament win in a Florida uniform, breaking a streak that threatened to span each player’s entire career. 
Although the Gators ended a significant drought, they were 
all more focused on taking the next step. 
“No one on our team has ever gotten one, so it definitely feels 
good,” said Parsons, who nearly recorded a triple-double with 10 points, 10 assists and seven rebounds in just 27 minutes. “But 
we’re not satisfied. We don’t just want to come in here and win 
one game.
“We want to make some noise. And it feels good right now, 
and we’re going to celebrate, but we can’t get too happy because Gators breeze by Gauchos, to face UCLA

Senior Stacie Lavender touched more lives during her 
time at UF than she may ever have realized. 
Family, students and Hare Krishna members flooded 
Shands at UF early this week to see Lavender, who was 
hospitalized after suffering head injuries Saturday while learning to drive a motorcycle. 
Lavender, a 21-year-old UF senior, died Tuesday. She was taken off life support after doctors said there was no chance of recovery, said Hanan Schwefel, the di-rector of Krishna lunch in Gainesville and Lavender’s friend and co-worker. 
Lavender was learning to drive her boyfriend’s motor -cycle Saturday when she fell and hit her head on a stair -
well at a Gainesville apartment complex, according to po-lice. She was wearing a helmet. 
“The nurses at the hospital told us that they had never 
seen so many people come for a single patient at a single time ever,” said Vanessa Guerrero, a childhood friend of Lavender’s. “It was like Woodstock on the fourth floor of 
Shands Hospital. People were…in circles with guitars and 
talking about how much she [affected] their lives.”Friends remember student as adventurous, givingSEE HOOPS, PAGE 13

 THEY WILL PERFORM “MACBETH” 
TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY ON THE PLAZA OF THE AMERICAS.
By JEANNA ARROYO
Alligator Contributing Writer
In most instances, shields, hubcaps and 
baseball bats are best reserved for scrapyards 
and street fights. 
For some UF students, it’s just another day 
of theater. 
This weekend, a group of UF students will 
be bringing William Shakespeare’s “Macbeth” 
to the Plaza of the Americas.
But it will be with a twist.
For this version, UF’s Shakespeare in the 
Park has chosen to set the play in a war-torn, 
post-apocalyptic Scotland. It will be performed 
today and Saturday at 6:30 p.m. A matinee will take place Sunday at 2 p.m.
The play will still feature the same char -
acters, prose and plot, but will have a newer, modern edge, according to JamieLynn Bucci, public relations chairwoman for the group. “It’s ‘Macbeth’; someone still has to be 
king,” Bucci said.
Joseph Sweeney, the group’s president, 
said there was a lot of debate on which play to do this year because the group has only done 
romantic comedies like “Much Ado About Nothing.” 
Although those plays were crowd-pleasers 
because of their slapstick humor and relatable plots, the group decided to move away from 
them to try to “spook the audience” this year, 
Sweeney said. 
“You can adapt it to so many variations, 
and it’s fun to watch,” he said. “It was origi-
nally designed to be played outside. We’re try-ing to offer the authentic Shakespeare.”
Shakespeare in the Park puts on one free 
annual production on the Plaza of the Ameri-cas. Audience members are encouraged to bring their own chairs, blankets and pillows.

A police traffic service that cut 
down car crashes may be coming 
back after a lack of funding took it off the books.
Gainesville Police Department’s 
Speed and Aggressive Driving Project reduced accidents by 14 percent when it started in 2010, Sgt. Joe Raulerson said, but there wasn’t any money for it this year.
Now Raulerson, part of the GPD 
traffic safety team, is asking the Flor -
ida Department of Transportation for $54,010 so the program can gear up 
with new equipment and more man-
power. 
The program will finance officers 
to drive around or park near streets that are known to have more crashes and fatalities, he said. Drivers, the idea goes, will pay more attention on the road once they know police are watching.
“A lot of it is visibility ,” he said. 
“Once you see red and blue lights, you know people are more cautious.”
Raulerson said officers will watch 
for drivers who run red lights, speed and fol-low the the cars 
in front of them too closely.
Officers will target Archer Road, 
University Avenue, 34th Street and Southwest Second Avenue.
He went before the Gainesville 
City Commission on Thursday to get permission to ask the state for the grant money . Now he has to wait to hear from the FDOT if his department received the funding.GPD wants funding to

Jill Burton pushes her voice through her throat in different 
tones. It’s soft, then louder, then softer again. It sounds like a 
didgeridoo.
It can’t be compared to Beyonce, but that’s not the point. Burton is a vocal performance artist, and for the past 40 
years, she’s explored the ways in which the power of voice can affect an audience emotionally, mentally and spiritually.
She doesn’t sing prepared pieces, but improvises a tonal 
“oh” sound, like a shaman leading a religious ritual. She uses her voice to tap into her listeners and alter their state of mind.
She’ll be joined by three others at the Thomas Center on 
April 11 for a performance she hopes will be a profound and transformational experience.
“We’re going to invite the audience to go on a journey 
with us to areas of their own consciousness that they may not be aware of,” she said.
Burton first discovered herself as a vocalist when she was 
an 18-year-old student at Santa Fe  College. She said her pro-fessor, Betty Keig, helped put her in touch with her inner art-ist.
She’s lived in cities such as New York, San Francisco, Mi-
ami and, most recently,  Sitka, Alaska, honing her talents and 
perfecting her craft. 
Last year, she was featured as an artist-in-residence for a 
month-long tour sponsored by the Improvisor Journal, which 
focuses on musical improv performance. She was also hailed as “one of the great foundation improvisors of America.”
Burton knows her style of singing is anything but main-
stream. Nevertheless, she believes the advent of the Internet and modern advancements in communication have helped bring a worldwide community of vocal performers together.
Beyond her performances, Burton runs transformational voice workshops and teaches private sessions for people in-terested in learning to sing more than just pop songs. She said most prospective students contact her through Facebook.
She said she’s ecstatic to watch a new generation of vocal-
ists take a strong interest in the art form she’s spent her life exploring and expanding.
“It’s really exciting to me to see so many young people be-
ing engaged,” she said. “It’s very gratifying, actually … being involved in this movement for 40 years … It’s kind of won-derful.”4, ALLIGATOR n FRIDAY, MARCH 18, 2011

MTV will hold an open casting call Satur -
day to find seven or eight strangers to stop be-
ing polite and start getting real for season 26 of “The Real World.” 
The open casting call will be  Saturday from 
10 a.m. to 5 p.m. at Mother’s Pub and Grill.“We always have good luck in Gainesville,” 
said Damon Furberg, supervising casting di-rector for ‘The Real World.’ “We have gone 
there for as long as I can remember.”
It takes about 3 months, Furberg said, to 
do 35 or 40 casting calls for one season. Can-
didates are narrowed down in rounds of in-terviews and one small group is flown to Los Angeles for a final interview.“We want to see everyone who shows up, 
so we pace ourselves accordingly ,” Furberg 
said.
All casting directors have different ways 
of interviewing applicants. 
Some play party games while others throw out a debate topic. 
TJ Goodman, co-owner of the pub, said 
MTV called him about three weeks ago to pro-pose the offer.
“My business partner and I still have no idea why we were chosen,” he said. “It was an honor.”
Furberg said producers often choose loca-
tions by interviewing students about their fa-vorite places to go.
Applicants are required to bring a photo ID 
and a recent picture of themselves. Applicants must be over 18 and “appear to be between the ages of 18 and 24.”
Anyone unable to attend the open call can 
still apply online. For more information visit

With candles in hand, 250 people 
gathered at the Reitz Union Amphi-
theater Thursday night to remember 
the lives affected by the 8.9-magnitude earthquake and tsunami in Japan last week
Megan Vu, president of the Asian 
American Student Union, said it’s im-portant to not just feel connected to the victims but also to each other in a spirit of unity in caring for Japan. 
“I think everybody in The Gator Na-
tion can see the potential that we have to make a huge impact,” she said. 
Hope for Japan, a new UF organiza-
tion, hosted the vigil and is meant to 
help provide disaster relief to Japan. 
Anthony Ray-Reynolds, Student 
Body vice president-elect and an execu-
tive board member for Hope for Japan, 
said that after Spring Break there were 
many student organizations that wanted to make a difference. 
“The biggest thing that stands out to 
me is how quickly we got the ball roll-ing,” he said. “A lot of times in the wake of a disaster there is a long process be-
fore things start up.”  
Taketo Nakao, a graduate assistant 
for UF Multicultural Diversity and Af-fairs, said UF students need to work to-
gether to support Japan.  
He said the group is making paper 
cranes and collecting donations to send 
to Japan. 
The group hopes to raise $5,000 with-
in the next two weeks.
“You can care in so many different 
ways,” Nakao said.250 honor quake victims

The brothers and owners of Designer 
Greens restaurants in Gainesville and Or -
lando opened a third restaurant, Kay Bros. 
BBQ, during Spring Break. 
The restaurant, located at 1620 W. Uni-
versity Ave., is just down the street from the sandwich and salad joint they opened two years ago.
Doors opened March 9, and within the 
first hour, Steven Kay, 27, said the new barbecue restaurant was nearly at maxi-mum capacity, seating about 50 people inside and 16 on the patio. He said he was pleasantly surprised, especially because 
the brothers had done no formal advertis-
ing other than a banner outside.
“It was actually a bit much for the first 
day ,”  Kay said. 
According to employees, the extensive 
preparation paid off. Cashier Kacey Over -street, a UF sophomore, said the restaurant operates similarly to Tijuana Flats, em-phasizing quick service. Customers order at the counter and their food brought out to them by cashiers clad in denim cut-offs 
and cowboy boots. Darren Kay , 25, said 
he thinks his brother “wanted the Jessica Simpson look.”
Instead of a hot sauce bar, the restau-
rant features a bar of eight different bar -
beque sauces that the broth-ers tested and perfected themselves, including a Kentucky Bourbon, Kansas 
City and traditional Memphis sauce. 
Eddie Gilley, 49, a minister at the Bap-
tist Collegiate Ministry, had lunch there for the first time on Tuesday. He said the rib combo was “very tasty” as he licked some of the sauce from his finger.
“I eat barbecue everywhere I go,” Gil-
ley said. “If they can keep this up, I think they’ll do real good.”BBQ joint opens near UF

Special to the Alligator
Stacie Lavender, a UF senior who sustained head injuries while learning how to ride 
a motorcycle Saturday, died after being taken off life support Tuesday. Her family will attend her graduation ceremony on April 30 and will be presented with her diploma. 
Maria Linares / Alligator
Hooters, located at 3265 SW 34th St., usually decorated by the restaurant’s colorful chairs and tables, is now empty. The 
restaurant and sports bar is closed until further notice. 
Lavender volunteered at the Krishna 
lunches on the Plaza of the Americas 
Lavender, a sociology major and wom-
en’s studies minor who grew up in West 
Palm Beach, would have graduated in May. 
She planned to become a paramedic. 
Her family will be attending the gradua-
tion ceremony on April 30 and will receive 
her diploma.
Lavender and Guerrero had been friends 
since they were 2 years old. 
They were surrogate sisters, Lavender’s 
sister Emily Keene, 29, said. 
Lavender’s mother died when she was 
13, and Guerrero’s mother helped take care of her while Keene completed her degree at the University of Central Florida. 
“We were like the three amigos, and 
then my mom left and then Stacie left,” Keene said. “I know they’d want me to be strong…and I’m going to try to do that.”
Guerrero remembers how giving Laven-
der was. When Guerrero was about to give birth to her son, Lavender finished her fi-
nals early to make sure she could be there. 
“She was the first one to hold him. My 
son is not even 2 and he still knows who 
she is,” Guerrero said. “It was sad, but 
when we came up to her apartment, he 
saw her door and started saying, ‘Stacie, Stacie.’ I was like, ‘Honey, she’s not here.’ He had me look through the whole house 
for her.”
Lavender served Krishna lunch on cam-
pus as a volunteer and later an employee 
for Gainesville Krishna House, offering 
vegetarian food and a smile to everyone 
who walked through the line, Schwefel, the Krishna lunch director, said.
Many people knew Lavender as “the 
blonde from Krishna lunch,” he said. He remembered Lavender telling him 
about a time when a group recognized her one night and did a Hare Krishna chant for 
her.  
“We as Hare Krishnas believe in reincar -
nation. At some point the body stops…and 
we move to a new body. Her soul is in a better place,” he said. “At the same time, I feel sad because I lost a good friend.”
Sarah Manesh, Lavender’s roommate, 
said  when Lavender wanted to do some-thing, she just went out and did it, even if no one came with her. Manesh plans to try to live her life that way, too.
Saba Rahman, a UF senior who lived 
with Lavender during their sophomore year in Murphree Hall, said she would miss her friend’s adventurous spirit.  
When Rahman called her at 2 a.m. one 
day last year and asked Lavender to go skydiving with her, she didn’t ask any questions. She just said yes, and she want-
ed to be the first one jumping out of that 
plane. 
 “I’m not just sorry for the friendship 
that I’ve lost, but I feel a lot of pity for the people that aren’t going to meet her,” Rah-
man said. “She crammed a lot of living into 
21 years. She really, really did.”LAVENDER , from page 1 THE FRANCHISE OWNER DID NOT MEET

If you planned on eating Hooters’ famous wings any-
time soon in Gainesville, think again.
Earlier this week both the Gainesville and Ocala loca-
tions of the sports bar closed, leaving only signs in the 
windows to let customers know. 
The local franchises were two of nine total restaurants 
to close because of expired license agreements, according to Alexis Aleshire, Hooters of America spokeswoman.
Aleshire wrote in an e-mail that both Owl’s Eyes Inc., 
owner of seven Hooters in the Southeast, including the ones in Ocala and Gainesville, and WOSG LLC,  had not met requirements to uphold their temporary license is-
sued by Hooters.
She said that neither company kept 
up with compliance with the agreements or payments that were due to Hooters of America. She did not detail what those 
agreements were. She also did not reply when asked how much money was owed or how many jobs were lost with the closing of the nine locations.
“We regret that Owl’s Eyes’ and WOSG’s noncompli-
ance with their obligations has led to the closing of these restaurants and we intend to consider the markets af-
fected for new Hooters development in the future,” she 
wrote.
Aleshire also said that the change had nothing to do 
with the new owners of Hooters of America, Chanticleer Holdings, an investment company . Instead, she pointed to  a long-term issue with both franchises. Representatives from Owl’s Eyes could not be reached for comment. Hooters restaurant in Gainesville closes abruptly

Today’s question: Are students’ FCAT scores a reasonable indicator of a teacher’s ability?Thursday’s results are unavailable due to technical problems.Smaller issues not federal concerns
The economy is in the tank. Unemployment is stag-
nant. The budget crisis has brought us to the brink of a government shutdown. Libya is burning, and 
Egypt is still in turmoil.
Last week, President Obama responded to this swirl-
ing mayhem by pouncing with laser-like precision and finely honed intensity on the one issue that he has de-cided needs addressing above all the rest.
Of course, I am talking about the issue of bullying 
in schools.
Alongside his wife, first lady Michelle Obama, the 
president hosted a summit at the White House to focus on this problem. The course of the discussion featured many of the predictable and stale platitudes about how 
bullying over race, physical features or sexual orienta-
tion lead to bad grades and suicide.
Bullying is bad. I get it. However, that is not the issue 
here. This episode sheds light on two primary problems with big government.
First of all, this is not a federal issue. The president, 
Congress, the Supreme Court and all other officials and agencies in Washington have important and specific duties. The men and women who have been elected 
and appointed to perform those duties were selected 
because of their perceived ability to competently and faithfully execute them.
As the federal government has expanded, the du-
ties have become muddied, and the focus has been lost. Washington bureaucracy has exploded to the point where the bounds set around the jurisdiction of the federal government have been obliterated, and the du-ties of office are no longer defined. This is why we have 
reached the point where Washington talks about obe-
sity, bullying and health care as much as securing our borders, stabilizing the economy and stopping terror -
ism. The peripheral functions the government has as-sumed have distracted our officials from the issues and problems that really matter.
Secondly, this illustrates the 
problems that occur when the fed-eral government assumes responsi-bility for issues that are best left to 
the smallest government possible.
As a conservative, I am a major 
proponent of small government. 
The concept of small government comprises two major principles. 
The first, and most commonly regarded, is that the fed-eral government should be as small and unobtrusive as possible. The second is that smaller governments should have more direct influence in the lives of their 
citizens than larger governments. That is, state and mu-
nicipal governments are more intimately linked with the everyday lives of those within their jurisdictions and thus should have greater control than the federal government over the laws and codes that maintain or -
der within a community.
According to this principle, a teacher is the head of 
classroom government, and a principal is the head of school government. In the past, such individuals were 
given the freedom to establish and maintain order and 
discipline within their jurisdictions. Thanks to frivolous lawsuits and warped conceptions of child psychology, however, higher governments have stepped in and stripped away these rights. This has severely limited the control that teachers and principals have over their jurisdictions and the freedom they have to deal directly with problems such as bullying.
If the federal government were to mind the business 
for which it was designed, it would do less to create problems that it then deems necessary to step in and fix.

We expect half of our readers will have a massive hang-
over when they see this, so we’ll make it short. 
And by short, we mean the same length as every other 
week. 
That’s right: Although the streets ran green with beer 
last night, your friends at the Editorial Board were hard at 
work on this week’s we-didn’t-realize-everybody-in-a-10-
mile-vicinity-of-a-bar-has-Irish-blood edition of...
Darts & Laurels
We aren’t the only ones who took notice of all the 
green. 
Governments the nation over have been trying to scale 
back spending. While the politicians’ hearts may be in the 
right place — and that’s giving them the benefit of the doubt — we’ve been questioning many of their choices for programs to cut. 
We’re giving you fair warning: Republicans may want 
to stop reading now.
To begin, the U.S. House of Representatives has voted 
to cut all federal funding to NPR. Although the measure is unlikely to pass in the more temperate Senate, we’re wor -
ried by the party-line voting to strip money from a valu-able public resource. That’s why we’re aiming a DART at 
House Republicans. 
Apparently, $1 million is too much to pay for one of 
the few reliable news sources our most isolated citizens can access.
In the same economic vein, Wisconsin’s governor got 
his way last Friday with a union-busting bill that ends col-lective bargaining for public employees. What good is a 
union without such an ability? That’s why we’re lobbing a 
DART at Scott Walker and his pals. 
Not only have they hurt the people of their state, they’re 
also setting a precedent for others around the nation.
The harm they’ve done to teachers and students may 
surpass the damage of a merit-based pay law in our state. That’s difficult to fathom, given that “merit” is determined largely by students’ FCAT scores, which we recognize as meaningless garbage. 
If you think students’ critical thinking is at a low point 
now, wait until teachers’ bottom lines are dictated by the test results. Because we became stupider by merely think-ing about that prospect, we’re pinning a DART on state 
lawmakers.
We haven’t doused Americans’ need to learn yet, how-
ever. 
In fact, our curiosity is alive and well. We aren’t just 
paranoid in the wake of Japan’s post-earthquake nuclear 
issues. Sure, some on the west coast are making a run for 
iodine pills. But for the most part, lawmakers from both sides of the aisle and their constituents are asking about our nuclear power plants. 
Even if it is born of fear, we think a genuine interest in 
how we receive our power is always welcome. Knowledge is a powerful weapon, after all. That’s why we’re giving a LAUREL to nuclear power experts. 
Thanks for walking us through the issue in words we 
can understand every day for the past week, even if you had to deal with cable news anchors. You’ve started an important discussion we needed to have.
As you can tell— other than St. Patty’s Day— this 
week’s been  sobering for us. But in the spirit of hope, we’re offering a final LAUREL and our condolences to the 
people of Japan.
Here’s hoping for a brighter week, Gators.

By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
aberry@alligator.org
Perhaps more so than any other player on 
Florida’s roster, John Brantley entered the spring 
practice season in need of a fresh start.
The quarterback struggled throughout a dis-
appointing junior season, throwing more inter -
ceptions (10) than touchdowns (nine) and seem-ingly never finding his comfort zone in Urban Meyer’s spread-option offense.
The Gators have only had one spring practice 
under offensive coordinator Charlie Weis and the new coaching staff, but there already ap-pears to be a new sense of optimism surround-ing Brantley as Florida’s signal-caller. 
“I’m not saying that I know everything right 
now, but I’m getting more comfortable with it,” Brantley said. “We’re a long way from where we want to be, but it was a good start yesterday.”
Heading into the offseason, Brantley’s future 
at Florida appeared to be up in the air, as he said he would reevaluate his future with the Gators and rumors circulated about him transferring. But he never left, he said Thursday, and he is hoping to leave his poor performance and lack 
of confidence behind him.
“That’s the past. I’ve moved on,” Brantley 
said. “That’s what’s good about this new coach-
ing staff. You start anew, start from scratch and build from there.”
Weis and head coach Will Muschamp said 
they expect Brantley to simply manage the game as a traditional drop-back passer throwing out of a pro-style offense, something that is better 
suited to his abilities.
Brantley’s experience won’t guarantee him a 
starting spot, and the three quarterbacks on the 
Gators’ spring depth chart — Brantley, Tyler Murphy and Jeff Driskel — are learning the new 
system at an even pace.
“We’re all at the same level, so we’re all help-
ing each other,” Brantley said. “There’s a lot Brantley ready for clean slate in 2011
“Hey man, I hate to ruin your va-
cation, but we got a problem.”
On the phone is my partner 
in Italy. An FDNY captain, he’s on his first va-
cation in six years. But a bookmaker is never on holiday .  
“Dominick got arrested last night.”
He says, “How bad is it?”
“I can’t talk over the phone. Come back to 
the states. It’s pretty bad.” 
Dominick’s our muscle. When gamblers 
“lay down,” he changes their minds. 
Our office has a 50-50 deal with Dom. We 
sell him bad debt. How he collects is his busi-ness. He makes a buck, and people learn they can’t rob our office. 
We’re firemen, not tough guys. We can’t 
threaten anybody. Dom’s had a casual ap-proach to violence since first grade. He always had a screw loose. 
Our first “lay downs” are small. We eat the 
losses or settle things ourselves. But as the of-fice grows, so do the problems. 
Red, my other partner, comes up with a 
new player: “Karl bets everything — hockey, basketball, football, you name it. Karl sends it 
in.”  
We’re established. We have 300 players. 
We’ve been in action five years. We welcome 
high rollers. Our line is sharp and updated fre-quently . It’s not easy to catch us napping.
The first week, Red’s 
new player beats us for $32,000. We pay him, no problem.
The second week, he 
beats us for $18,000. We pay him, no problem.
The third week, we 
beat him for $40,000. 
He says, “Go f*** 
yourself.” 
Big problem.Someone loses and cries poverty, it’s under -standable. Someone’s in over his head, no one wants to get tough. We want our money , and we don’t want to lose a customer. We work out installments. No juice, just a payment plan.
Gambling’s an addiction. Things happen. 
It’s part of the business. But Karl’s a thief. He beat us for $50,000 in two weeks. Now, Karl loses $40,000, and he’s not even making an excuse. 
By telling us to shag off, Karl’s saying 
you’re not connected. You’re nobody . I ain’t paying. 
We have to find out is whether or not Karl’s 
a gangster. If he’s a made guy , we’re screwed. By TYLER JETT

Solomon Patton sees one major differ -
ence with Florida this year: “The swag is back.”
Patton, a sophomore wide receiver, 
said he is more excited about the team 
now than he was at this point last year, 
when he enrolled a semester early to participate in spring practices. The most important reason for this enthusiasm, he said, is the attitude of the team’s new coaching staff.
“Our generation, we call it ‘swag,’ and 
I feel like the whole coach-ing staff has got swag,” he 
said. “They bring swag to 
us. That just makes us play with a good, swagged-out attitude.”
In particular, Patton is 
eager to work with Aubrey Hill, his new position coach. Hill, who played at Flor -
ida from 1991-94, comes to Gainesville after three seasons with Miami. 
Last year, the Hurricanes’ two lead-
ing receivers, Leonard Hankerson and Travis Benjamin, caught 115 passes for 1,899 yards. The Gators’ most prolific pass-catchers, Deonte Thompson and Trey Burton, combined for 70 catches for 780 yards.
Patton noticed Miami’s receivers 
looked relaxed on the field, something New staff’s 
enthusiasm

The Gators have something in 
common with their opening-round 
opponent in the Women’s National Invitation Tournament on Friday. 
Both teams, Florida and UMBC, 
foresaw themselves playing for a championship at season’s end. 
But that usually means NCAA, 
not NIT. 
“UMBC is a very talented and 
well-coached team,” Florida coach 
Amanda Butler said. “They have first-team all-conference members in 
their starting five. They have some players who can really score.
“They’ve also played great com-
petition. Like several teams, they are 
probably surprised they aren’t in the 
NCAA Tournament.”
Butler was 
likely referring to 
her own squad, at 
least a little bit. 
H o w e v e r , 
Butler and the 
Gators (18-14, 
7-9 Southeastern 
Conference) aren’t letting a some-what disappointing season damper 
their spirits heading into Friday’s 
matchup with the Retrievers (20-11, 
13-3 America East) at 7 p.m. in the O’Connell Center. 
“We knew that we were a post-
season team when the year began, 
and twists and turns throughout the season have brought us here,” But-
ler said. “We’re excited about hav-ing an opponent to prepare for and 
to have a team to focus on in practice 
this week.”
Florida won two games over 
Tournament teams down the stretch, and after a loss to Tennessee in the 
second round of the Southeastern 
Conference Tournament, Butler said 
she thought Florida deserved to be 
in the field of 64. The Gators made it to a field of 
64, and while it’s not the one they originally envisioned, their sights 
remain set on capturing a champi-
onship this season. FRIDAY, MARCH 18, 2011 n ALLIGATOR, 13

Florida women’s basketball coach Amanda Butler isn’t letting an of-
ten disappointing regular season affect the Gators’ NIT preparation.
UF looks to end year with NIT title
Women's
Bask etballwe’re on a mission.”
The next hurdle UF faces in trying to reach its goal is a con-
test Saturday against seventh-seeded UCLA, which beat No. 
10-seed Michigan State 78-76 immediately after Florida’s win. 
To prepare despite the quick turnaround, the Gators re-
turned to their hotel rather than sticking around to scout their 
next opponent in person. 
Macklin said the team would hold a meeting late Thursday 
or early today to hear the scouting report on their next adver -
sary . That leaves the Gators with one practice session, which 
Donovan hopes will be enough following three days of strong 
focus and preparation prior to UCSB. 
“These guys understand what’s at stake,” Donovan said. 
“They realized what happened today, the margin of victory — that’s not going to be the case next game. 
“They got their legs under them, and 
they’ve seen the atmosphere and got a win. Now, can we come back and … have the same kind of focus we’ve had the last three 
days?” 
That strong week of practice led to UF 
dominating UCSB in almost every statistical category . 
The Gators scored at will, amassing a 58.1 shooting percent-
age. The team was equally stout on the defensive end, holding 
the Gauchos to just 27.3 percent from the field en route to a 
43-19 halftime lead. 
Amid rampant criticism that the team didn’t deserve a No. 
2 seed, Florida did everything it could to prove itself against inferior competition. 
“We wanted to focus on winning and block out what people 
were saying,” sophomore guard Kenny Boynton said. “We just wanted to come out and play our best game both offensively 
and defensively.”Florida dominates UCSB 
in every facet of game

Junior Sarah Bateman had the Gators’ high-
est finish of the day , taking sixth place (22.15) in the 50-yard freestyle finals, improving on her eighth-place standing in the preliminary round. Bateman received All-American hon-ors but said she wishes her time had been bet-ter.
“I was happy with the 50 free, but I knew 
I could have gone faster like I did at SECs,” she said. 
Junior Shara Stafford received honorable 
mention All-American honors for her fourth-place (22.45) finish in the “B” finals of the 50 free. The award was her seventh career All-
American award, tying a team best.
Freshman Elizabeth Beisel also placed in 
the finals and received All-American honors, 
taking eighth place (4:42.18) in the 500 free.
The Gators missed the “A” finals in both relays, which UF coach Gregg Troy said would be instrumental to the team’s success. 
The team of Bateman, Stafford, freshman 
Ellese Zalewski and sophomore Jamie Bohu-nicky finished first in the 200 free relay “B” finals. Meanwhile, Beisel, Bateman, Stafford and freshman Hilda Luthersdottir took sixth in the “B” finals of the 400 medley relay.
“The team competed hard today , but it just 
wasn’t enough,” Bateman said. “We have to swim much better tomorrow.”
Troy agreed his team needs to step up if it 
wants to win another NCAA title, but he said he was happy with the results at the end of the day.
“We swam a lot better tonight than we did 
this morning,” Troy said. “We have to regroup, 
come back tomorrow and race tough. We have 
a long ways to go.”
After Day 1 last season, when UF went on 
to win their first national championship in 28 years, Florida was in fourth with 107 points. 
Day 2 of competition begins today at 
noon. There will be five individual swimming events, two swimming relays and one diving competitionGators women recover from slow start, in 10th after Day 114, ALLIGATOR n FRIDAY, MARCH 18, 2011

Despite being the top-ranked 
team in the nation and getting off 
to the program’s best start since 
1992, coach Kevin O’Sullivan has 
one concern about his squad head-ing into Southeastern Conference play.
When No. 1 Florida (15-2) trav-
els to Baton Rouge, La., to open a three-game series against No. 8 LSU (16-1) tonight at 7, O’Sullivan hopes his team can overcome a 
problem that has plagued it the 
last two games: leaving runners on base.
Over the last two games — an 
8-6 win against Rhode Island and a 5-4 extra-inning victory against FSU — Florida has stranded a combined 25 men, including a 
season-high 13 against the Semi-
noles.
“I don’t know how you work 
on it, to be honest with you,” O’Sullivan said. “It’s a frustrat-
ing thing. … I think if you did that 
10 times in a row, you’ll probably lose nine out of the 10.”
While he might not know how 
to fix the problem, Florida’s skip-per understands why his team is struggling to plate those runners. 
He believes the Gators need to 
do a better job not falling behind 
in the count and getting quality 
at-bats in those situations.
Two times each against URI 
and FSU, UF ended an inning with the bases loaded. 
Florida also stranded runners 
in scoring position in eight other innings. 
In the bottom of the ninth 
against FSU, Brian Johnson sin-
gled to lead off the inning, and 
pinch runner Paul Wilson stole second and moved to third on a wild pitch. 
However, Florida squandered 
the opportunity, as the next three batters went down in order.
Those missed chances nearly 
cost the Gators against the Rams 
and the Seminoles.
Florida could have easily se-
cured both games or put them out 
of reach with a couple of quality 
at-bats in those situations.
“If you ask any coach at any 
level, it’s one of those things,” 
O’Sullivan said. “Good teams hit with runners in scoring position.”
“They have a better approach. 
They don’t pull off. They’re ag-gressive early in the count.”Second baseman Josh Adams 
said the only way to get over the hump is through repetition.
The Gators have recently been 
working on situational hitting in practice against their own pitch-ers, he added.
But the senior knows his team 
can’t continue to blow those scor -
ing opportunities if it hopes to open SEC play with a big series win in Baton Rouge.
“We got lucky,” Adams said 
of the last two games. “Against really, really good teams, they’re going to take advantage of that. 
“And we’d be lucky to come 
out with a win if we leave that many runners stranded again.”FRIDAY, MARCH 18, 2011 n ALLIGATOR, 15

Gators to test undefeated home

Despite piling up several wins against lower competition, Gators will face a true test at home on Saturday at 1 p.m against No. 11 Syracuse.Tennis
No. 13 men’s team falls to No. 3 USC at home
For the fourth time this season, Florida showed its weakness against a top-ranked opponent, drop-ping a tight 4-3 match to Southern California.The No. 13 Gators (11-4, 4-0) came out strong Thursday evening, winning two of the three doubles matches to claim the first point over the No. 3 Trojans (14-2). Hopes were high at Linder Stadium at that point, with one of the largest home crowds of the season on hand to watch Florida battle the two-time de-fending national champions.

By making a conscious effort to push tomorrow out 
of their minds, the Gators have strived tirelessly to avoid 
jumping ahead of themselves throughout the season.
But the time to focus on the Southeastern Conference 
Championships is finally here, and it’s become their top 
priority. 
No. 1 Florida, the defending SEC champion, will com-
pete in what its gymnasts call the “funnest meet ever” on 
Saturday in Birmingham, Ala.
On top of facing six conference squads, the stage set for 
the competition will present a different surface beneath the gymnasts’ bare feet. 
The SECs are performed on a podium, which is a raised, 
championship-style floor that has bouncier equipment, re-quiring the gymnasts to work arduously to control their bodies on the springy surfaces.
Sophomore Ashanée Dickerson remembers being intro-
duced to the format for the first time in last year’s SECs. 
“It was hard trying to get used to it,” Dickerson said. 
“Once the first event was over, you knew what you had to 
do, and it was fine after that.” 
UF coach Rhonda Faehn said the athletes will have to 
make adjustments, including backing 
up their runs on vault so they don’t overshoot. They will also have to be extra careful not to gain too much mo-mentum, causing them to go out of bounds on their floor routines. 
Although the Gators don’t have a 
podium to practice on in their home practice facilities, the team held a mock meet this weekend to mimic the upcom-ing competition as well as possible. 
Compared to the intrasquad meets the gymnasts have 
performed in all season, Faehn said Saturday’s was phe-nomenal. 
“Normally when we have an intrasquad, there’s a little 
bit less energy because it’s not the actual competition,” Faehn said. “It didn’t happen this time. They were really 
up.” 
And being “up” is something UF will have to squeeze 
every last drop out of come 5 p.m. Saturday.
With the podium, the teams have to stay in a designated 
corral, separating the performing athlete from her cheer -
ing teammates. This stains the usual screaming huddles in 
which the Gators engulf the performing gymnast after the close of her routine.  
“You’re on a stage and it’s your show time,” sophomore 
Liz Green said. “Even though our team has to stay in a cor -
ral down on the podium, it’s kind of like you try to be as loud as you can.” 
But fellow sophomore Marissa King said Saturday’s 
competition will ultimately come down to the fine details and polish of the routines, a focus of the entire season.
“We have the gymnastics in the bag,” King said. “We 
know the gymnastics skills, we know our routines. 
“Really, it’s just about focusing on those small details 
because our bodies can do it, it’s just the concentration and the focus that we need to be able to do those skills per -
fectly.”Florida ready to

Senior QB trusts Weis’ experience, knowledge
of confusing things going on 
right now with this offense just because it’s all new to us, but we’re just going to try to help each other and become the leaders.”
But Brantley has quickly taken to his new position coach, speaking highly of his knowledge, reputation and ré-sumé — particularly in devel-oping quarterbacks like Brady Quinn and Tom Brady.
“Coach Weis is a genius 
with the offense, and he’s go-ing to do great things here,” Brantley said. “You can put a 
lot of trust in his hands because he knows what he’s doing. He’s got the track re-
cord to show it.”
And Brant-
ley’s teammates are picking up on his excitement for a fresh 
start in 2011.
“You really can’t tell right 
now from this first practice, but I feel like Brantley, he’s lov-ing this offense,” sophomore 
receiver Andre Debose said. 
“He’s loving every second of it.”
FOOT , from page 12
Then, we need to know if he’s crazy. If 
he’s crazy , how crazy? My partners and I 
don’t do crazy . Dominick takes care of the hard cases. If he’s a tough guy, we have to hope he’s not as crazy as Dominick. This puts the odds back in our favor. 
I introduced Dom to my partners two 
years ago. He was making small talk as we 
drove across the Bronx in my partner’s Hon-
da Prelude.
“Yeah, you see that tree over there in that 
park? Whatta beating me, Gobbo and Dodo put on some mook by that tree. We beat this guy for 30 minutes. What a tough prick. He 
smiled while we beat him. I kicked that prick 
until my foot hurt. He just kept smiling. When we got done beating him, I couldn’t sleep. His smile haunted me. It’s all I could think about. I knew I had to kill him. 
“So, Dodo drove me down here five or six 
times.  Finally, one night we see him alone by that same tree. So, we drive by . I use my uncle’s hunting rifle, and I shoot him in the 
head. Boom, right over there by that tree.” 
My partner shoots me a nervous look. I 
avoid his staring eyes by looking out the pas-
senger window at the buildings lining the six-lane road we’re cruising. My mind drifts. 
Instead of thinking about the sociopath in 
the back seat, I focus on the architecture.
The Grand Concourse was the Champs-
Élysées of the Bronx. The boulevard runs through the center of the West Bronx from 138th Street and Mott Avenue, past Yankee Stadium, all the way up to Moshulu Park-
way.  
The H-Type apartment buildings enclos-
ing the roadway were designed to resemble 
the Moorish architecture of Spain. These apartments once housed luminaries such as Babe Ruth and Milton Berle. 
The only semblance of celebrity left in 
these once-fashionable apartment buildings are the neighborhood’s famed drug dealers.
Ethnic minorities, on rent control, now 
inhabit these fine examples of Art Deco ar -
chitecture. The Grand Concourse no longer resembles the Champs-Élysées. 
The center island of maple trees with 
grand apartment buildings lining both sides of the boulevard has disappeared. Also gone are the middle class, the neighborhood stores and the architects’ dream. 
At the moment, I want to be in Paris — 
anywhere but inside this car. I’m forced back to the problem at hand.     
My intuition warns me that a halo’s only 
a short distance from a noose. Things have been good. We’re due for a fall.
Dominick is borderline psychotic. I intend 
to exploit his disorder for my own benefit. No good can come of this. 
A Bronx maxim: You’ve got to be a stand-
up guy . You can’t screw your friends. Afraid of blowback, I’ve used Dom sparingly. 
His sheer workmanlike approach to vio-
lence boggles my mind. Dominick emanates perpetual foreshock. His dispassionate, dis-tant, dead eyes never blink.
Although not intimidating in size, you 
know any confrontation with him will have to be to the finish. He’s telling a story about how he secured work for his cousin.
“I tell my foreman, ‘Put my cousin to 
work.’ My foreman says, ‘I don’t need any-
body right now.’
“I said, ‘My cousin needs a job.’ He said, 
‘You deaf? I don’t need anybody .’ 
“I went up on the roof, maybe 12 floors, 
see him down below, pick up a cinder block 
and drop it. I missed his head by two feet. When he looked up at the roof, I saw him shaking. I smiled and wagged my finger at him.
“‘He put my cousin to work.’”I say , “Holy shit, man, how did you get so 
close to him without hitting him?”
He shoots me a look like I asked him to 
split the atom: “What do you mean so close? I tried to kill him.”
His indifference to consequence, moral or 
otherwise, would stun Attila the Hun.
He shocks me. And I’m not the everyday 
citizen.
Blinky , my partner, warns me, “I don’t 
care how long you’ve known him. We can’t use this guy. He’s crazy.”
He’s right, yet our problem cries for 
Dominick’s expertise.
First, a preliminary question: Who does 
Karl know? We find out he’s not connected. One last chance to get our money the easy way, I call him at home.
“This problem won’t go away.”“You’re dealing with serious people.” “What do you think we’re playing 
games?” 
All fruitless. I send Dominick. 
In the nightclub business, when you hire 
a doorman, you hire a gentle giant. You don’t 
want problems. In the bookmaking busi-ness, illusion is not enough. Threats must be backed up by cold efficiency . 
I should have heeded Blinky’s warning. The last dance approaches. The fiddler 
will have to be paid.

because former receivers coach Zach Azzani micromanaged his players. Last August, several re-ceivers praised Azzani for being so 
detail-oriented, but their feelings 
soured as the season progressed.
“Coach [Azzani] was on top 
of you the whole time,” Patton said. “Every-thing you did, he was on top of you the whole 
time. Coach Hill, he backs off a little bit. He’s more laid-back. 
He lets you be who you are.”  
THOMPSON NOT IN THE SLOT:  
On the preliminary depth charts handed out to the media Mon-
day, Thompson was listed as the 
team’s slot receiver. With new of-fensive coordinator Charlie Weis relying more on two-receiver packages, putting Thompson in the slot would imply his playing time could decrease significantly next season.
“I think that was a misprint,” 
he said Thursday. “I haven’t been in the slot yet.”
Instead, Thompson said he has 
been working at the two standard receiving spots while Frankie Hammond Jr. lined up in the slot during the team’s first practice Wednesday.Thompson
