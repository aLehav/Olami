Although UF education pro-
fessor Kara Dawson said she 
personally doesn’t use Wikipe-dia to prepare for her classes, she said using the website isn’t such a bad idea.
A Pew research study sur-
veyed 2,462 Advanced Place-ment and National Writing Project   middle and high school teachers on how they used technology at home and in the classrooms. 
The study revealed that 
Wikipedia, a favorite one-stop shop for students, is be-ing overwhelmingly used by teachers who often ban the website as a credible source. About 87 percent of the teach-ers surveyed said they used Wikipedia to ﬁ  nd information online, according to the study. That’s higher than adult Inter-net users as a whole at 53 per-cent.
Dawson, whose specialty is 
in technology and education, said using Wikipedia is only a concern if it is the only source being used. She said that Wikipedia 
pages aren’t in depth enough and that more than one source should be considered.
“The idea of banning it from 
students is a bad idea,” she said. “Students need to learn how to triangulate sources.” 
Pre-occupational therapy 
freshman Monica Mercado, 18, said she thought it was hypocritical for teachers to ban Wikipedia as a resource.
“They say we don’t know 
how to use our resources cor-rectly, but then they’re doing what they ask us not to do,” she said. “If they used the re-sources they’d like us to use and told us which ones to use, they’d be leading by example and I’d be more willing to not 
use Wiki.”

Plot twist: Teachers use Wikipedia   
◗ THE GAINESVILLE PRICE IS $4 A BOX.

Florida State University students will get their Girl Scout Cookies 
cheaper than the Gators.
Although cookies all share the same packaging, regions surrounding 
Gainesville vary in price. Cookies in Gainesville cost $4 a box, and in some 
other areas of Florida it costs $3.50.
Nancy White, director of communications for Girl Scouts of Gateway 
Council, said although it looks to the public that cookie season is one big sale, each council is its own independent nonproﬁ  t agency.
Alachua County is in the Girl Scouts of Gateway Council, along with 
15 other counties.
Damali Reales, a 20-year-old UF sociology sophomore, said she was 
surprised the prices were not universal.
“Girl Scouts are national,” she said. “You would think there should be Local Girl Scout Cookies 
pricier than other areas’

In his fourth visit to UF, Holocaust 
survivor and acclaimed writer Elie Wi-
esel spread his love for learning at the Phillips Center for the Performing Arts on Tuesday night. The event was spon-sored by Accent Speaker’s Bureau for Jewish Awareness Month.
“I’m coming here maybe subcon-
sciously because I feel an eagerness to know and an eagerness to learn,” he said.
Wiesel, a philosophy professor at 
Boston University, focused his speech on the importance of learning and the sin of not learning. He said it was easy to teach philosophy, but to talk about his experiences is difﬁ  cult.
“I am not convinced that the book I 
wrote, the story I tried to tell, the wit-ness I wanted to share was ‘Night,’” Wiesel said about his memoir, “Night,” which chronicled his time during the Holocaust.
He shared his experiences of speak-
ing at the United Nations and giving advice to the Dalai Lama about living in exile.
Accent’s Associate Director Jack 
Causseaux said roughly 1,620 atten-dants were in-house and 500 watched Wiesel speak on a screen outside the Phillips Center.
Wiesel answered audience mem-
bers’ questions afterward about the second amendment, Israeli-Palestinian relations and his favorite Jewish holi-day.
Biology junior Gabriel Hernandez, 
21, came to see Wiesel speak for the second time since middle school. He said he enjoyed hearing Wiesel speak about the importance of learning.
“He’s passing on learning,” Her-
nandez said. “He’s making us all wit-nesses.”

◗ SHE GOT SECOND PLACE.
COLLEEN WRIGHT
Alligator Writer
“Jeopardy!” just happened to 
be on TV while Yellowlees Doug-
las was getting her hair braided in 1996. She couldn’t help but shout out the answers.
“It was fun that I might know 
the answers, and I might not,” she said.
Seventeen years later, the UF 
business professor appeared on the show as a contestant in the episode that aired Friday.
Douglas fell to second place 
with $3,200 and took home $2,000. She lost by $3,599.
“Did I think I was going to 
win?” Douglas recalled. “No. I just didn’t want to embarrass myself.”
Inspired by an Alligator article 
about a UF honors student who took the “Jeopardy!” qualifying test, Douglas began trying to get on the show two years ago.
Last March, she took the on-
line qualifying test for the show. Out of 25 questions, she said she only missed one because she ran out of time.
A representative from the 
show gave her three weeks’ no-tice for her June 6 audition in New York City.
The day before the audition, 
she went kayaking on the Hud-son River and got sick from get-ting some of water in her mouth. The friends she was staying with tried to convince her to not go to the audition, but Douglas went anyway.
In October, she was called 
back and flown to Los Angeles for the taping of the show.Douglas said she had trouble 
buzzing in her answers because she doesn’t have an opposable thumb. She said she only had a chance when the other contes-tants didn’t know the answer.Douglas said she joked around 
on the set with host Alex Trebek and the show’s producers.
“It was the biggest event in ev-
eryone’s life except me,” she said, “and I treated it like a big joke.”
The Final Jeopardy! question 
was about a brother and sister team who lost in the 1969 Acad-emy Awards. Even though she couldn’t remember who the pair was, she wagered $7,000, accord-ing to www.j-archive.com, be-cause her aunt Maggie Smith won the Academy Award for best ac-tress that year for “The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie,”  Douglas said.
Douglas said she went on the 
show to get exposure for voi-ceover work.
Since the episode aired, Doug-
las has reconnected with high school friends who saw her on the show and a man even pro-posed marriage to her.
“Jeopardy!” fan Alex Ruben-
stein became curious when he heard Douglas say she was from Gainesville on the show. The 27-year-old management doctor-al student looked her up on the UF College of Business website and found her.
“I immediately began rooting 
for her,” he said.

a standardized price.”
White said there are two bakers 
nationally who are licensed to create 
Girl Scout Cookies, and each council can decide which baker they want to use to negotiate deals.
“Just like any other product, they 
would set their own negotiations to determine what price they are going to pay for their cookies,” she said. “And they would negotiate that deal independently.”
The price reflects the economic 
region and the needs of the council, she said.
White said she doesn’t think UF 
students will turn away because the additional 50 cents.
“Girl Scout Cookies are a delicious 
snack meant to be eaten in modera-tion,” she said. “But we know you are going to stock up.”
Sarah Williams, a 20-year-old UF 
speech pathology sophomore, said the 50 cents wouldn’t keep her from buying her favorite cookie, Thin Mints.
“I think people will still buy 
them,” she said. “They’re so good.”
White said because the cook-
ies are for a good cause, students shouldn’t feel guilty about the extra pounds they will gain during cookie season.
“It’s a fundraising program, but 
it’s also a leadership program for girls. For us it’s not really about cookies,” she said. “Though we love the cookies.”
Girl Scout Cookie season will last 
until March 25.

alligator.org.SCout S, from page 1◗ A NEW LAW SCHOOL RANK 
METHODOLOGY WAS USED.
SAMANTHA SCHUYLER
Alligator Contributing Writer
UF’s Levin College of Law 
continues to rank highly both as 
a public and overall institution among 201 public and private ac-credited law schools, according to a   released Tuesday. The new law school methodol-
ogy puts more emphasis on the types of jobs landed after gradua-tion.
Last year, the law school ranked 
25th among public schools and 48th overall. This year’s rankings show a jump to 23rd among public schools and 46th overall.
The college’s tax program main-
tained its standing as first among public schools and has kept a top 10 position at third overall. The col-lege’s Environ-
mental & Land Use Program kept its position as fifth among public institu-tions but went down from ninth to 12th overall.
Robert Jerry, 
dean of the law school, warns that this data should be taken with a grain of salt.“Rankings are very sensitive 
to employment data, and the em-ployment data they use is not au-dited,” he said. “There is a lot of confusion in law schools about whether someone is employed in a part-time or full-time job. It creates a considerable inaccuracy that has an impact on the rank itself.”
Although wary, Jerry was 
pleased by the potential effects of rankings on reputation.
“We have a ranking of 3.9 [out of 5] on how judges and lawyers think about our law school, 11th highest among our state, 26th high-est among all law schools,” Jerry said. “If [judges and lawyers] like what you’re doing, they like your graduates.”
Will Matthews, 23, a second-
year law student, views the im-proved ranking as a benefit.
“Any help that students can get 
in this legal market … is always a plus,” he said.

Bringing a gun to school is 
not something teachers nation-
wide would want in their job descriptions, and Gainesville teachers are no exception.
Local teachers would most 
likely choose not to bring a gun to school, said Karen McCann, president of the Alachua Coun-ty Education Association.
“Because we’re in a univer-
sity town that has a tendency to be more liberal than other cit-ies in Florida, they would sway toward not wanting to have to bring a gun to school,” she said.
A national survey of about 
11,000 teachers conducted by the School Improvement Net-work found that about 75 per-cent of teachers in the United States wouldn’t want to carry a firearm to school.
The survey reflects a grow-
ing concern with school safety following the Sandy Hook El-ementary School shootings in December.
McCann added that teachers are aware of the changes in their job and environment in the last 30 years.
“Society is different. Kids 
are different. [Teachers] were obviously heartbroken like ev-erybody else was,” she said of the Sandy Hook shooting.  “The Newtown incident was horrific, but the reality is that people and kids are being shot every day.”
David Hamblen, a behavior 
resource teacher at Idylwild Elementary School, said school safety is the No. 1 priority.
“My main concern as an ad-
ministrator is to make sure that these kids end up at home in the same condition that their par-ents sent them in,” he said.
However, he said security measures should be left to prop-er authorities that are already armed.
“They’re trained in how to 
deal with situations and how to use those guns properly and de-escalate situations so that those guns do not have to be used,” he said.
Hamblen said that putting a 
resource officer into every local elementary school and secur-ing campuses with fencing and gates are the best solutions to increase safety.
As the topic of gun control 
and school safety continues to be debated among current teach-ers and government officials, it’s also shaping the way future teachers plan their careers.
Jordan Hawkins, a 21-year-
old UF education junior, said that in the classroom, her stu-dents’ safety is one of her main responsibilities but disagreed with needing to arm herself.
“I see there’s a reason for it 
and why teachers do it, but I wouldn’t do it,” she said. “It’s sad that this is an issue that has to be brought up.”

Lazy foodies — rejoice!
Gainesville2go, a local delivery 
service, recently began delivering orders from fast food restaurants such as Chipotle, Taco Bell and McDonald’s to customers around the city.
“These restaurants are just 
places a lot of our customers have requested that we deliver for, so we threw them up on our web-site,” said Jackson Bodiford, a manager at Gainesville2go.
Unlike most of their popular 
restaurants, these new offerings are unaffiliated with Gainesvil-le2go, meaning the delivery ser-vice doesn’t have contracts with them, Bodiford said. “With fast food restaurants, 
since they make the food so fast, we just email things to our driv-ers, and they just go through a drive-thru,” he said.
UF students seemed pleased 
at the idea of being able to order fast food in a simple and conve-nient way.
“It’s not too far from my 
apartment, but the delivery ser-vice would be pretty nice,” said Roshni Marballi, a 21-year-old UF psychology senior.
Gainesville2go has seen about 
10 orders a day for McDonald’s, Taco Bell and Chipotle, making them about equally as popular as the other choices, Bodiford said. 
Bodiford said the company is 
expecting a boom of customers.
Meanwhile, students like Mar-
balli look forward to using this new service, if only sparingly.

I’m feeling,” she said.Chipotle, McDonald’s,

When Carole Dunne worked long 
hours at a rehabilitation facility, she 
said, her boss expected her to go in early and stay late. She was never paid for her overtime work.
“I was afraid to ask for anything ex-
tra because there were 20 people in line waiting for my job,” she said.
Dunne told her story during an Ala-
chua County commission meeting at the County Administration Building on Tuesday, where county officials and residents discussed options for a pro-posed wage theft ordinance.
The proposed ordinance would pro-
vide county mediation for employees who haven’t received wages in a timely manner.
Jacqueline Chung, manager of the 
Alachua County Equal Opportunity Office, said the plan would help em-ployees and employers decide whether they should take a labor discrepancy to court.
“This proposal is just mediation,” 
she said.
County Commission Chairman Mike 
Byerly questioned the effectiveness of an ordinance that doesn’t provide a ver-dict through adjudication.
“I don’t want to set up a process that 
doesn’t do anything,” he said.
Byerly added that he was hesitant 
about a clause in the ordinance threat-ening penalties for frivolous claims. He said requiring evidence such as pay stubs should be enough to ensure the county isn’t overrun with unfounded complaints.
“I don’t want to establish anything 
that will have a chilling effect,” he said.
Dunne said a clause requiring an 
employee to notify the employer of his or her intent to file a complaint before he or she does so could lead to the em-ployee being fired on the spot.  
“There’s a real fear factor in going 
to your boss saying ‘I think I’ve been shortchanged,’” she said.
Commissioner Susan Baird ex-
pressed concern for the capability of staff to take on the workload mediating wage cases would add.
“This could potentially be quite a 
bit of an addition of responsibility,” she said.
For now, county staff will continue 
researching the issue and will modify the proposal.

An argument about a boyfriend led to the arrest 
of a Gainesville woman Monday after she allegedly 
attacked another woman and threatened her with various sharp objects.
Gainesville Police charged Lynette Christina Ja-
kovlev, 35, of 2232 SW 35th Place, with aggravated assault and simple battery, according to a GPD po-lice report.
At about 3 p.m. Monday, Jak-
ovlev and the victim, Ida Felicia Mosley, were at a house party in the 2200 block of Southeast Eighth Place, GPD spokesman Officer Ben 
Tobias wrote an email. The two be-gan arguing after Jakovlev asked about Mosley’s boyfriend.
When Mosley tried to walk 
away, Jakovlev grabbed Mosley’s 
hair and yanked Mosley to the ground, pulling some of her weaves from her head, according to the report.
While Mosley was on the ground, Jakovlev 
pulled a nail file from her purse and held it like she was going to stab Mosley, according to the report. Mosley picked up a chair to defend herself while Herman Miller, the owner of the house, disarmed Jakovlev.
Jakovlev then grabbed a pair of scissors from her 
purse and pointed it at Mosley. Miller also snatched the scissors from her, according to the report.
Jakovlev threatened Mosley again with a hand 
rake, which Miller took from her as well.
Jakovlev’s final threat was with a piece of glass 
she found in the yard. After Miller disarmed her for a fourth time, he pushed Jakovlev off his property and called police, according to the report.
Officers later arrested Jakovlev at Miller’s house. 
Jakovlev was booked into the jail at about 5:40 p.m. Monday. She was released Tuesday afternoon after she met bond.

With more than 7,700 lakes, 700 springs and 825 miles of 
sandy beaches, people might not believe water is depleted in 
Florida.
A new water survey from UF’s Institute of Food and Ag-
ricultural Sciences and the Center for Public Issues Education showed that Floridians are more concerned with water qual-ity than with water quantity.
Alexa Lamm, director for the National Public Policy Eval-
uation Center for Agriculture and Natural Resources, led the survey of 469 Floridians in  December. In a monthly webinar series, she said most Floridians are confident their community will have enough water, but not as confident about the safety of water in their homes.
Cynthia Barnett, water activist, author and journalist, 
spoke at the Lou Frey Institute’s Water and Florida’s Future Spring 2013 Symposium on Monday morning. She said she is concerned about the perception held by the public because Floridians have an illusion of water abundance.
“Water flows from our taps like magic,” Barnett said. “We 
enjoy an endless and cheap supply of clean water, and we are more than happy to be absolved for the realities of our waste-water.”
At the symposium, Blake Guillory, the executive director 
of the Southwest Florida Water Management District, said his district uses about a billion gallons of water each day.
“We make sure there is enough supply available for the 
public, for industry and for agriculture,” he said.
Barnett said one solution that ensures Florida’s water fu-
ture is as rich as its past is a new ethic for water.
“A water ethic means making sure that the way we live 
with water today doesn’t jeopardize fresh, clean water for our children and ecosystems of tomorrow,” she said.Floridians value H2O quality over quantity
“A water ethic means making sure that the 
way we live with water today doesn’t jeopardize 
fresh, clean water for our children and 
ecosystems of tomorrow.”

Papal conclave 
party has just begun
THIS WEEK ON VATICAN’S NEXT TOP POPE:
That’s right, folks. The papal conclave, the selection 
process of the world’s new pope, started this week. As 
of Tuesday evening, the college of cardinals had not selected a new pope.
Pardon our glib tone comparing this medieval ceremony 
with Tyra Banks’ franchise, but the pageantry of the event 
always seems odd in these modern times.
Here in America, we’re used to things being out in the 
open. 
We just love our social media. Heck, it was Mitt Romney’s 
birthday this week, and his son posted an Instagram photo of him eating a cupcake with a birthday hat on. We share everything.
It’s a little weird and mysterious that these 115 cardinals 
are behind closed doors until they reach a decision.
Is it a popularity contest? (Pope-ularity! Sorry.) Do the 
cardinals run smear campaign ads of their opponents on closed-circuit Vatican TV? How are we supposed to know who to vote for from home with a toll-free number, like when we used to pay attention to “American Idol”?
“Italy’s Angelo Scola and Brazil’s Odilo Scherer are 
spoken of as strong contenders,” according to an article in Reuters. “The former would return the papacy to Italy after 35 years in the hands of Poland’s John Paul II and the German Benedict XVI. Scherer would be the ﬁ  rst non-European pope since Syrian-born Gregory III in the 8th century.”
“However, a host of other candidates have also been 
mentioned as ‘papabili’ — potential popes — including U.S. cardinals Timothy Dolan and Sean O’Malley, Canada’s Marc Ouellet and Argentina’s Leonardo Sandri,” the article goes on to mention.
This is like God’s rose ceremony on “The Bachelor” to 
the new pope. Instead of a fake TV wedding at the end, this new pope will inherit a laundry list of problems to deal with.
The current state of the Catholic Church is “threatened 
by secularism, the scandal of clerical sex abuse and a Vatican bureaucracy stippled with corruption,” according to a New York Times article.
“And in a bizarre twist, basketball star Dennis Rodman 
promised to be in St. Peter’s Square on Wednesday in a makeshift popemobile as he campaigns for Cardinal Peter Turkson of Ghana to become the church’s ﬁ  rst black pope,” according to an Associated Press article.
Oh, well. This whole competition will be over soon, 
right?
“There is no time limit to reach a decision, the last 
conclave in 2005 lasted two days but in 1268, it took 33 months to elect Pope Gregory X,” said an article in the Hufﬁ  ngton Post.
Oh.President Obama is missing the Mark
A parable, according to many scholars, is an earthly message with a heavenly meaning. Similar to an anal-ogy, they are typically short, anecdotal stories ﬁ  lled 
with characters and events that are deeply symbolic. In addi-tion, parables were a common form of teaching in Judaism.
Used to simplify tough theological concepts, the parable 
was an effective tool for many rabbis. Jesus Christ utilized them pretty frequently during his ministry while on Earth.  
My favorite parable is in Matthew 25, known as the “Par-
able of the Talents” (it has different names, depending on the version).
It tells of a wealthy man who is going on a journey and en-
trusts a share of his “talents” to each of his three servants. To one he gives ﬁ  ve talents, to another two and to another one. The master leaves, but we don’t know where he goes and for how long. He is testing them.
The servant who received ﬁ  ve talents goes to work and 
doubles the amount that was given to him. The servant who received two talents also goes to work and also doubles the amount. But the third servant, who received only one talent, didn’t double that which was given to him. Scared, he buried his talent in the ground and hid it.
When the master returned, he demanded an account of 
their work. The ﬁ  rst two servants explained that they had gained 100 percent of what they were entrusted. The mas-ter lauded both of them, putting them in charge of “many things.”
Then, as the story goes, the third servant approached his 
master and told him he was afraid of disappointing him, scared that he would lose his talent (this is why he buried it).
His master was furious. He criticized the third servant for 
his indolence.
Although Jesus used this parable to metaphorically illus-
trate our biblical responsibilities, there is a universal — and political — application, as well.
Let me explain.Every week, the Chider-in-Chief blasts Republicans be-
cause they support lowering taxes and letting people keep more of their hard-earned money.While refusing to embrace the 
only sensible solution that will solve America’s feckless and reck-less spending problem (i.e., cutting spending), the president and his minions in Washington continue to spout the same old rhetoric: raising taxes on the wealthy, or as he calls them, the “well-off” and “well-connected.”
Since when is getting a second and third job (i.e., gener-
ating more revenue) the only answer to pay off your credit card debt?
Since when is it OK not to pay your bills by putting them 
on the backs of your children?
Since when should you be rewarded like the two men 
who doubled their talents when you — like the man who chose not to work hard, who chose not to take risks — de-cided to do nothing?
According to a FoxNews.com article — nothing but the 
best, people — data showed about 37 percent of the federal income tax burden fell on the top 1 percent, while 41 percent had a zero or negative tax liability.
Our president must read a Bible that is fundamentally dif-
ferent than our own.
He believes Jesus was a socialist. He believes that if you 
don’t work, you will eat. He believes that beggars can be choosers. He believes that all men were not created equal. He believes that what you sow the government reaps.
His favorite verse is Mark 12:17, when Jesus said, “Render 
unto [Obama] that which is [Obama’s].”
His favorite passage is Romans 13.After Jesus shared one of his parables, his disciples asked 
him, “Why do you speak to them in parables?”
He replied, “Because the knowledge of the secrets of 
the kingdom of heaven has been given to you, but not to THEM.”

I can still recall most of my Preview weekend at UF.
I remember sharing a room with my only friend 
from home. I remember how much we talked about 
the beautiful campus — smiling as we thought about 
all of the exciting opportunities ahead of us. But, what I didn’t remember about that weekend until recently was the presentation given by the University Police’s Office of Victim Services. As I try to remember sitting in the back of the large room, I can faintly recall the victim advocate introducing what the office does and where it is located — but beyond that, nothing.
Maybe because it was so short? Or was it that my 
mind was preoccupied with the more “interesting” or “re-latable” presentations? Either way, I was about to move hours away from home and hadn’t thought once about what I would do or who I would talk to if I was a victim of a crime.
Laura Kalt, from the Gainesville Police’s Victim Advo-
cate Unit, explained that “we don’t think about it, because we don’t think it can happen to us.”
Statistically, though, it can happen to any of us. In 2011, 
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published that more than 1 in 3 women and more than 1 in 4 men in the United States have experienced rape, physical vio-
lence, and/or stalking by an inti-mate partner in their lifetime.
What is intimate partner vio-
lence?
The National Intimate Partner 
and Sexual Violence Survey de-
fines it as the “physical violence, sexual violence, threats of physical or sexual violence, stalking and psychological aggression (including coercive tactics) by a current or for-mer intimate partner.” 
There are many misconceptions about intimate partner 
violence, including that it is extremely rare, only happens to women and that it only occurs in minority communi-ties.
But this type of violence happens to people from all 
walks of life, regardless of sexual orientation, religion, race or social status.
According to the National Coalition Against Domestic 
Violence, females ages 20 to 24 are at the greatest risk of experiencing nonfatal intimate partner violence.
One UF student, who wished to remain anonymous, 
was the victim of a violent crime her first year at UF. “We constantly think it’s the stranger in a dark alley that is go-ing to harm us, but more often than not it is the person right next to us,” she said.
Awareness is the key to preventing this type of vio-
lence.
While UF has a plethora of services available after a 
situation occurs — from the UFPD Victim Advocates to the Dean of Students Office and the Counseling and Wellness Center — awareness of these programs is not as prevalent.  
“The university is very helpful when it comes to pro-
tecting the well-being of students,” UPD Victim Advocate Laura Templeton said. 
She added that in past circumstances, housing has 
moved students from residence halls they did not feel safe in, and the dean of students can even help students change classes if necessary.
But the student who was once a victim of crime said 
she didn’t know those resources existed.
When it comes to protecting yourself, knowing what 
constitutes a healthy relationship is key. Healthy relation-ships are built on respect, trust, honesty and communica-tion. Controlling and violent tendencies from your part-ner should never be considered the norm.
In order to stop the cycle of violence, seeking help 
is the first step. If you believe that you or someone you know may be in an abusive relationship, please contact University Police to confide in a victim advocate.

Speaking OutBoy Scouts of America and Girl 
Scouts of the United States of America have become iconic 
images of our nation’s patriotism. 
In both organizations, meetings 
begin by pledging allegiance to the American flag.
There is no doubt that these two 
organizations work toward instilling the most honorable and moral values in our American youth.
Both scouts have similar missions 
and standards for their members.
This raises the question of why they 
are separated. 
Applying a different organization to 
each gender further adds to the sexual discrimination and stereotyping that run rampant throughout the U.S. 
Reinforcing the concept of gender 
separation through popular youth-oriented clubs places restrictions on their members’ potential to flourish beyond society’s gender norms.
Furthermore, there is an obvious 
genderization of skills that are learned with the scouts. 
Girl Scouts earn badges based off of 
creativity and domestic skills.
Boy Scouts earn merits that involve 
more rugged and outdoor activities.
The Girl Scouts is a great 
organization that helps build strong, talented women. 
According to the statement posted 
on its website, “Girl Scouting builds girls of courage, confidence, and character, who make the world a better place.”
This statement creates an image of 
the ideal woman in our equal-gendered society.
But the requirements for the 
majority of their badges tend to teach a feminized skill set.
A few examples of the badges that 
can be earned as a Cadette are Practical Life Skills, Science and Technology, and Healthy Living. 
Cadette Girl Scouts are ages 12 to 
14. 
Similar to the Girl Scout mission, 
these three badges sound very useful and gender-neutral, until the deeper details are revealed.
Practical Life Skills badges teach 
12-year-old girls how to babysit, which, according to the badge’s name, is an essential skill they will need throughout their lives. 
Science and Technology badges 
teach girls “how scientists measure happiness,” while Healthy Living badges emphasize the beauty benefits that result from eating well-balanced and nutritious meals.
Although not all the badges offered 
are as feminized and borderline sexist, I think these three are disturbingly so.
They are teaching girls how to 
ascribe themselves to the stereotypical female role many men and women are trying so hard to break.
Contrary to the feminized Girl Scout 
badges are the Boy Scout merit badges. 
When looking at the Girl and 
Boy Scout badges, the most obvious difference lies in the labeling.
Girl Scout badges tend to have more 
ambiguous names.
But the Boy Scout badges are more 
straightforward. A 
s i g n i f i c a n t portion of the merit badges i n v o l v e outdoor sports 
and activities.
Archery, bird study, camping and 
climbing are a few examples.
The badges require scouts to perform 
the activity stated in the name.
Then they have to complete reports 
based on already-provided questions.
The process to earn a badge for Boy 
Scouts is a little more meticulous than it is for Girl Scouts. 
The gender differences between 
both organizations are apparent by performing the necessary activities that each badge calls for.
The gender segregation of each 
scout group does not simply end at just separating each gender.
It is present throughout. This shows how profoundly inherent 
gender roles are in our culture. 
We should be teaching girls and 
boys the same skills and values.
Their sex should not influence the 
way they are taught to be good people.
Integrating the Boy Scouts of 
America and Girl Scouts of the United States of America into one organization is a way to show that a person’s sex does not confine them to any specific role or expectations. 
Gender is a mere construct of 
society.

Speaking OutI speak for the trees
Construction of the new Heavener School of Business is 
set to begin soon. In preparation for the new building, UF is 
about to start cutting down a huge number of trees (about 100) on the northeast corner of campus — the corner of Uni-versity Avenue and 13th Street. 
The tree clearing will begin any day now. This corner is at 
one of the main gateways to campus and is currently beauti-fully landscaped with a variety of trees and shrubs, includ-ing some very old, tall pines, oaks and magnolias. 
If you haven’t visited this pretty corner of the university 
in a while, you’d better do it now because it will soon be gone forever.

Every Friday for the past 25 
years, W. E. “Mac” McEachern has 
been meeting with friends at break-fast restaurants around Gainesville.
“We call ourselves the old cur-
mudgeons,” he said as his friends finished up their meals Feb. 22 at the 43rd Street Deli & Breakfast House deli, many of them wearing “McEachern for District Four” cam-paign T-shirts.
McEachern, 81, is running for 
District 4 city commissioner for Tuesday’s city elections on a plat-form of honesty and conservatism, he said.
In his time as a Gainesville resi-
dent, McEachern served nine years on the Gainesville-Alachua Region-al Airport Authority, six years as a city commissioner and one term as mayor.
Now, he’s back in politics — al-
most 25 years later — because he feels the current City Commission has brought the city “to the point of fiscal collapse.”
One of McEachern’s main con-
cerns centers on a biomass plant un-der construction off U.S. Highway 441.  Because of the plant, a fuel adjust-
ment fee of 5.1 cents per kilowatt-hour has been added to Gainesville Regional Utility electric bills, he said.
The city is saying that residents 
will see the benefit of the plant down the road, but “students won’t be here down the road,” McEachern said.
“We have to have somebody look 
at it from a practical point of view,” he said. “My administration is going to get the money back to the people now.”
McEachern also said there are 
bus transportation and housing is-sues in the city.
To McEachern, the Regional 
Transit System works well for UF and Santa Fe College students, but he wants to improve the bus sys-tem in low-income areas around the city.
While McEachern was a commis-
sioner from 1981 to 1987, the Com-mission passed an ordinance that prohibited more than three unre-lated people from living in the same house in certain areas and turned vacant lots around the city into sin-gle-family homes.
McEachern said he wants to pre-
serve neighborhoods by enforcing noise pollution violations at bars and eliminating pressure on single-family homes to be demolished and apartments built in their places.
Annie Orlando, who’s known 
McEachern for almost 25 years, said she believes he’s the best candidate for the job.
“He’s got a lot of integrity,” she 
said. “He’s a very honest man.”Orlando said she supports 
McEachern’s plan to improve the relationship between the City Com-mission and residents.“Mac is going to change all of 
that,” she said.

Randy Wells says he needs three more 
years to get the job done.
The incumbent District 4 Gainesville 
city commissioner is running for re-elec-
tion in Tuesday’s city elections.
In his past term, Wells was challenged 
with balancing Gainesville’s budget in the face of the economic downturn.
He said the City Commission softened 
the blow of the recession by trimming po-sitions to avoid layoffs and raising extra revenue from a fire assessment fee to avoid raising property taxes.
Wells said the key to keeping the city 
in good shape is to invest in basic services such as law enforcement and public parks.
He said these services make the city 
more attractive to businesses looking to re-locate or expand.
“Hopefully, many students will have 
the opportunity to stay here and start busi-nesses of their own and raise families here in Gainesville,” Wells said.
A Colorado native, Wells moved to 
Gainesville a decade ago so his wife could attend graduate school at UF.
Since he moved to Gainesville, the now 
45-year-old property manager has jumped into community involvement.When the U.S. Army Reserve Center 
closed on Northeast Eighth Street several years ago, Wells and a few neighbors peti-tioned to city officials to turn the property into a neighborhood park and community space.
Wells is currently the chairman of the 
Equal Opportunity Committee and the Metropolitan Transportation Planning Or-ganization in the City Commission.
During his past term, Wells said he was 
proud of his involvement in working to restructure the former Gainesville Correc-tional Institution into a center for homeless services.
Wells said he wants to continue the 
project if re-elected. He added that he also wants to continue advancing bicycle and pedestrian connectivity and safety as well as an improved bus transit system that connects the city to the rest of the county.
Derek Helmick, Wells’ campaign 
manager, first met Wells during an Ala-chua County Young Democrats meeting in 2009.
“He styled himself as the young voice 
of politics in Alachua County,” the 25-year-old said.
Helmick began campaigning for Wells’ 
first election in 2010 and said he was moved by Wells’ passion for local issues. Helmick even put law school on pause to campaign for Wells.
“You tend to put things on hold when 
you see people like Commissioner Wells out there,” he said.

Leases
Information reprinted with permission by UF’s Off Campus LifeMake sure you read and fully understand all aspects of the lease before sign-
ing.  A lease is a contract between you and your landlord that spells out specific 
details of your living arrangement.  Leases often involve policies about pets, 
security and pet deposits, legal entry and other important information.  Typically, 
leases in Gainesville are 12 months. If you will need housing for 10 months or less, 
talk with the management about whether they can provide a short-term lease.  
There are two types of leases that are usually available, Joint 
Leases and Individual Leases.
Joint Lease:  
All roommates are held respon-
sible for the lease.  If one person 
breaks the lease, the other room-
mates are held responsible for 
paying the total rent.  This tends 
to be the lease more prominent 
when renting a house or 
single-family dwelling.Individual Lease : 
Each person is held responsible for 
his or her own actions.  For instance, if 
one roommate breaks the lease, that 
person is still responsible for paying his or 
her own rent.  For most college students, 
individual leases are the best choice.  
Each person in the lease is responsible 
for his or her own actions and not the 
actions of a roommate.  
Clauses to LOOK FOR in a lease: � At management’s dis-
cretion, the tenant may be 
asked to leave within three days
� Tenant waives all de-
fects in the building
� Landlord shall not be re-
sponsible for injury to person, including tenant and guests, as a result of any cause
� Tenant is responsible for 
all repairs to premises 
� Landlord may enter dwelling without notice
� Landlord has a lien (a 
legal claim on the property of another as security for the payment of a debt) on all personal property of tenant
A great University of Florida 
resource available to full-time students at no charge is Stu-dent Legal Services.  For any questions on your lease, visit the Student Legal Services website www.studentlegalser-vices.ufl.edu and set up an appointment with a lawyer to help review it BEFORE you 
sign it. Clauses to AVOID in a lease: 
� Dates of occupancy: 
Compare these dates to the 
beginning and end of the school year
� Amount of monthly rent 
and the date it is due each month
� Amount of Applica-
tion Fees, Security Deposit, Redecoration Fees and any other fees charged
� Responsibility for pay-
ment of utilities
� Responsibility for gener-
al maintenance and repairs
� Sublease: If you sign a 
12-month lease but think you may need the dwelling for a shorter period of time, make sure the lease allows you to sublease (rent your dwelling to another person who will assume the remainder of your lease) 
� Pet policy
� Automatic renewal 
clause
� Type of lease: Joint vs.

Below are five tips to use 
when looking at safety dur-
ing your apartment search:1. Go back to the com-
plex at night.  How do you 
feel?  Is the place well lit 
and populated, or dark 
and isolated?
2. Does the property 
have working security 
gates and/or guards?
3. Check for deadbolts 
on the front door, locks 
for individual doors, alarm 
systems, etc. and ask lots of 
questions about the securi-
ty.  Is there an extra charge 
for a security system?
4. Has there been crime 
in the area recently?  What 
actions have been taken 
to prevent crime from hap-
pening?
5. Don’t forget about 
purchasing Renter’s Insur-
ance to protect you and 
your stuff from the unex-
pected.Having a roommate is a great 
way to divide the costs of living off 
campus. However if you don’t find 
the right person to live with, living 
off campus could be challenging.  
Below are some tips that will help 
those who are thinking about living 
with a roommate.
� Communication is key.  Talk 
about your budget for housing, ex-
pectations for safety, expectations 
for guests and what your housing 
needs are before you even begin 
your search.  Being on the same 
page as your roommates will make 
your co-habitation experience 
much better and reduce the pos-
sibility of conflict. 
� Start with a friend or sibling.  
These are often good options for 
roommates since you already 
know them.
� Before moving in, come to 
an agreement about who will get 
which bedroom and bathroom 
along with which cabinets/storage 
space each person can use.� Discuss how payment of rent 
and bills will take place.  Is each 
person responsible for his or her 
own bills or will someone be in 
charge of collecting payment from 
each roommate?
� Don’t have someone you 
want to live with?  Some apart-
ment complexes offer “Roommate 
Matching” or “Roommate Place-
ment.”
� Roommate Matching: You fill 
out a survey and management 
attempts to match you with like-
minded roommates based on the 
form
� Roommate Placement: Apart-
ment management places you in 
any open space they have avail-
able
� Make sure you can change 
apartments if management places 
you with roommates you are not 
compatible with.

If you are thinking about renting a house or 
apartment, Renter’s Insurance provides important 
coverage for both you and your possessions. A standard Renter’s Policy protects your personal property in case of theft or damage and may pay for temporary living expenses if your rental is dam-aged (including loss of use). It can also shield you from personal liability. Anyone who leases a house or apartment should consider this type of cover-age. 
Talk with your parents before getting your own 
renter’s policy.  If you are still financially dependent on your parents or a family member and they own a home, they might be able to cover you under their homeowner’s policy.  Some homeowner poli-cies will cover a dependent’s rental property while in college.  
There are several types of Residential Insurance policies.  Read your policy information carefully and ensure you have full coverage.  Policies should include coverage for the following items: 
• Fire or lightning 
• Windstorm or hail 
• Explosion 
• Aircraft 
• Vehicles 
• Smoke 
• Vandalism or malicious mischief 
• Theft 
• Damage by glass or safety-glazing material 
that is part of a building 
• Falling objects 
• Water-related damage from home utilities 
• Electrical surge damage
Floods, earthquakes, sinkholes and hurricanes 
aren’t on the list. If you live in an area prone to one or more of the four, you’ll need to buy a separate policy or a rider. In areas where hurricanes can pose a threat, you might also need to buy a sepa-rate rider to cover wind damage.  Ask your insur-ance agent about this extra coverage.  Gainesville is prone to hurricanes and some areas flood.

Renter’s Insurance
You can’t find the right place to 
live until you know how much you 
are able to spend.  Here are some budget considerations you should think about while touring a property:
1. What is the cost of monthly 
rent?
2. What’s included in that rent?  
Utilities, gas, water, cable, Internet?
3. What’s not included in rent?  
What is the average monthly cost for gas, electric, water and gar-bage disposal?  If management doesn’t know, contact GRU at www.gru.com and they can pro-vide average costs of utilities from the previous year.
4. Want to have a pet?  Factor 
in the deposit and monthly cost for food, medical and grooming care.
5. Don’t forget the insurance.  
Before you sign your lease, call your insurance company and see how much it will cost monthly to insure your apartment or house.
6. Are you going to need fuel for 
your vehicle or are you going to use the bus?  Factor in transporta-tion/car maintenance costs to your budget.
7. How much will you spend 
monthly on groceries or on a meal plan?
8. Have some fun!  Don’t spend 
so much on rent that you don’t have money for leisure time.
9. What do you spend on cloth-
ing, shoes and accessories? 
10. How much money can you 
save every month?  It’s really good to save some money every month to cover unexpected emergency expenses.  Even $20 a month saved is good.  Every little bit counts.To help you with your budget, 
OCL has a budget spreadsheet in 
the Gator Guide to Off Campus Life (page 5) and online at www.offcampus.ufl.edu/gator_guide. 
Your living environment plays a 
major role in your overall happiness and wellbeing.  Know what you want to get out of your living space and choose your location and roommate(s) accordingly.  Now that you call Gainesville home, let Off Campus Life help you get the most out of your off-campus experi-ence.

Can I Be Evicted If I Pay “My” Rent 
and My Roommates Don’t?
Usually.  Most leases provide that the tenants 
are jointly and severally liable for the entire rent. 
This means the landlord can evict you unless the full rent is paid.
It is possible for you to sue your roommates in 
small claims court to collect their share of the rent and utilities.  A written roommate agreement will 
be helpful in proving your case in court. 
 Given the difficulty of collecting money on a 
judgment quickly, the best thing you can do is obtain new roommates.So What If I Get Sued? I Have No Money!
Any judgment for money damages is enforceable for at least 20 years 
and earns interest. A judgment may be enforced by seizing your wages, 
bank accounts, or your personal property.  A judgment will also adversely 
affect your credit rating.
Application Deposits : Never put 
down a deposit to hold an apartment 
unless you have a written agreement in-
dicating whether it is refundable.
Model Apartments:  Never sign a 
lease based upon a model. Insist on see-ing your actual apartment.
Cost:  Can you afford it? Even if your 
roommates leave?
Safety:  Inspect the locks on the doors 
and windows – is there a deadbolt on the 
front door? Do sliding glass doors have adequate locks to deter forced entry? Are the hallways and parking lots well lit? Make sure tree limbs and shrubs in front of the apartment are well trimmed. 
You can contact the Alachua County 
Sheriff’s Office or the Gainesville Police Department for information on crime in 
the area.Function:  At move-in, check all 
plumbing and appliances. Run water in 
sinks, showers and tubs, flush toilets, and 
check air conditioning and heating. 
Inventory:  Note all defects on the 
inventory sheet or check-in list signed by 
the landlord or an impartial witness. Pho-tograph or videotape the apartment at 
movi-in.
Appearance:  Is it clean? Do the 
carpets look worn or smell bad? Has the 
apartment been painted recently? Do the walls have nail holes? 
In some Gainesville neighborhoods, 
only three unrelated persons may live together. Check with the city if you plan on having more than two roommates.
Retain a copy of the lease and all at-
tachments or addendums to the lease for your records. Have all promised re-pairs and improvements written into the lease and signed by the landlord.  
Get clear written permission for any 
pets.What Should I Look For In An Apartment?
Information reprinted with permission by UF Student Legal ServicesWhat Should I Do 
Before I Sign a Lease?
DO
� Read the lease and 
make sure you understand it.
� Review a copy of the 
lease with an attorney prior to 
signing it.
� Expect to pay full rent, not 
just your share. This is what “joint and several” liability means, a term included or implied in nearly all leases. 
�
 Obtain a copy of the 
lease and all attachments or addendums to the lease, and put everything with your per-sonal records.
�
 Have all promised repairs 
and improvements written into the lease and signed by the landlord.
�
 Insist on seeing your ac-
tual unit.
� Get clear written permis-
sion for any pets.
� Check for maintenance 
responsibilities when renting a house or duplex.
 DON’T 
� Do not sign a 12-month 
lease unless you are willing to pay rent for 12 months.
� Do not sign a 12-month 
lease with roommates unless all roommates are willing to rent for 12 months.
� Do not have your par-
ents sign the lease or a paren-tal guarantee agreeing to be responsible for rent, if possible. See if the landlord will accept an additional security deposit instead.
� Do not sign a lease with 
automatic renewal clause.
� Do not sign a lease that 
gives the landlord unlimited ac-cess to the apartment without notice or consent.
� Do not sign a lease based 
upon a model apartment.
� Do not sign a lease be-
fore visiting the neighborhood at various times during the day, at night and on weekends.
� Do not sign a lease until 
all agreements negotiated with the landlord are in writing.Failure to pay rent is the quickest way to be evicted! The land-
lord will serve a notice demanding payment of rent or possession 
of the apartment. If you fail to comply with the demand within 
three days, excluding weekends and holidays, eviction proceed-
ings may be started. Neither surrender of the apartment or evic-
tion ends your liability for rent! You should contact an attorney 
immediately upon receipt of a three-day notice.What Can Happen 
If I Don’t Pay Rent?
Can I use My Security Deposit 
for the Last Month’s Rent?
No. Landlords can legally evict you for non-payment of rent even 
when your “security deposit” is equal to your last month’s rent. The 
purpose of the security deposit is to protect the landlord against damages to the apartment.WEDNESDAY, MARCH 13, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, STUDENT LIVING GUIDE , 11
Getting AlongDo I Really Need Insurance 
For MY Personal Property?
Yes. Unless you are financially able to replace all your 
belongings, you should have insurance. Proper insur-
ance coverage will protect you against the loss of your 
valuables in most circumstances. Landlords are legally 
responsibly for such losses only under very specific, lim-
ited circumstances that may be very difficult to prove in 
court. 
If you are a resident-relative of your parents, your per-
sonal property may be insured through their homeown-
er’s policy. Have your parents confirm the coverage in 
writing with their insurance agent. 
If coverage is not available through your parents’ 
homeowner’s policy, you may be able to purchase 
renter’s insurance. Even with insurance, there are cer-
tain precautions you should always take. Always lock 
your apartment securely even if you are only going next 
door. Never leave jewelry, cameras, cash, checkbooks, 
credit cards, electronics, or other valuables in plain 
view.
Information reprinted with permission by UF Student Legal ServicesMy Landlord Refuses to Make 
Repairs, What Can I Do?
You MA Y be able either to withhold your 
rent or terminate your lease if the problem 
constitutes a material breach of the lease or the Act. You must follow the exact re-quirements of the Act. 
 You must give the landlord a written no-
tice demanding the repairs be made in seven days. The notice must indicate an in-tent to terminate the lease or withhold rent if the repairs are not made.  
This is a complicated process and the le-
gal consequences are very serious. Do not attempt to terminate your lease or withhold rent without first obtaining legal advice.Can I Deduct 
Repair Costs 
From My Rent?
No. 
The Act does not autho-
rize you to make repairs or to recover the cost of such repairs. In fact, most apart-ment leases prohibit re-pairs by tenants. When the landlord refuses to make repairs, the Act gives you a qualified right to termi-nate the lease or withhold rent. As previously indicat-ed, you should consult an attorney before attempt-ing to terminate the lease or withhold rent.
12, STUDENT LIVING GUIDE , ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, MARCH 13, 2013
Getting Evicted
Can I Be Evicted For Any Other Reason?
Yes! Your lease can be terminated if you violate any lease terms, rules and regula-
tions, or the Act. If your lease is terminated and you do not vacate the apartment, 
the landlord may file for your eviction immediately.
Termination begins with a 7-day notice.  Your options depend on whether the vio-
lations are classified as “curable” or “noncurable”.
If you receive either type of notice, you should contact an attorney. Neither termi-
nation of your lease, nor your eviction from the apartment ends your liability for rent!
Curable Violations:  
You will be given seven days 
to correct a curable violation. 
Curable violations include unau-
thorized pets, guests, parking, or 
the failure to keep the apartment 
clean and sanitary. If you repeat 
the violation within 12 months, 
you will not be given another 
chance.Noncurable Violations : 
The landlord may terminate your 
lease with a 7-day notice without giv-
ing you a chance to correct a non-
curable violation. Noncurable viola-
tions include deliberate destruction 
or misuse of the landlord’s property 
or a continued, unreasonable distur-
bance. What Exactly Is An Eviction?
An eviction is the formal end to your right to oc-
cupy the apartment. It does not end your duty to 
pay rent. 
An eviction starts with a Summons. You must file 
an Answer within 5 days. Contact an attorney im-mediately.
If the court rules against you, a judgment for pos-
session of the apartment, unpaid rent, late fees, interest, court costs and attorney’s fees will be en-tered for the landlord. The sheriff will post a notice at the apartment that requires you to vacate within 24 hours. If you do not vacate within 24 hours, the sheriff will remove you and your personal property from the apartment.
What Are My Duties 
As A Tenant?
� First, last and always, PAY RENT!
� Comply with all other lease terms.
� Comply with all rules and regulations.
� Comply with housing and health codes.
� Comply with all zoning restrictions.
� Keep the apartment clean and sanitary.
� Keep plumbing fixtures sanitary.
� Do not damage the apartment.
� Do not disturb your neighbors.How Do I Find A Good Roommate?
Check the Off-Campus Life website at http://www.dso.ufl.edu/offcampus. 
Check bulletin boards around campus and classified ads as additional sources. 
Discuss with potential roommates preferences in food, music, personal habits, 
sleeping and study hours, friends and finances. An open and frank appraisal of 
each other’s likes, dislikes, and expectations will increase the chances of an enjoy-able shared living experience. A written roommate agreement is advisable.

Getting Out
There is no time period 
established by the Act. You 
should not sign a lease that provides for automatic re-newals of requires you to give the landlord a notice of nonrenewal. If you do sign such a lease, you must strictly comply with the no-tice requirements imposed by the lease.   There are some limits to the enforce-ability of these clauses. Contact an attorney if you have any questions.
If the lease does not 
specify otherwise, renew-als are a matter of general contract law. The landlord cannot force you to renew prior to the end of your lease.  However, if you do not renew by the landlord’s “deadline,” the landlord may rent your apartment to someone else. What Can I Do About Noisy Neighbors?
Try to reason with the neighbor to reach an acceptable com-
promise. Thin walls and conflicting schedules make some amount 
of noise disturbance an unavoidable reality of apartment living.
Ask the landlord for assistance. If the landlord refuses to cor-
rect the problem, you may be able to break your lease. Because the law in this area is so poorly developed, legal representation is a necessity. 
In extreme cases, call the police and report the matter. Unfor-
tunately, this can lead to revenge and reprisals. 
I Can’t Stand My Roommate. 
What Can I Do?
Discuss the matter with your roommate immediately. Don’t ig-
nore the problem with the hope that it will go away. A little give and take may result in a livable compromise. 
Under the Act, your landlord is not responsible for most room-
mate disputes. If your roommate is violating the lease, you should consult an attorney.  14, STUDENT LIVING GUIDE , ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, MARCH 13, 2013
What Steps Can I Take To Protect My Security Deposit?
When you take occupancy of the apartment, complete a thorough written inventory of the 
apartment’s condition and have the landlord or an impartial witness sign the inventory. Make 
sure you keep a copy of the inventory. This helps protect you from the landlord claiming you caused pre-existing damage.
When you move out, clean the apartment completely and thoroughly. Some landlords pro-
vide a checklist outlining the cleaning they expect you to do. Keep all your receipts for clean-ing supplies and professional carpet cleaning as evidence.
Before you leave, ask the landlord to inspect the apartment with you. Complete a move-out 
checklist and make sure the landlord signs and dates it. Use an impartial witness if the landlord is not available or refuses your request. Move-in and move-out photographs or videotape are strongly recommended in case there is a dispute.
Can I Break My Lease Because…
I am graduating?   No!
My roommate left?    No!
I cannot afford the rent?  No!
I need to work this summer?  No!
The neighborhood is unsafe?  No!
Under the Act, you can only terminate the lease 
if the landlord is materially violating your lease or the Act. You should obtain legal advice before attempt-ing to terminate your lease. In many cases, the best 
thing you can do is find replacement tenants.
Information reprinted with permission by UF Student Legal ServicesDoes the Law Require 
Interest Payments on 
Security Deposits?
Landlords must hold security deposits in 
one of three methods. Two methods of hold-
ing the deposits require interest to be paid. The method which does not require interest payment is the one most landlords use. The landlord is required to inform you in writing how your deposit is being held, where it is held, and whether you will receive interest.
Can I Sublet My Apartment?
Usually. the landlord cannot unreasonably withhold consent to an assignment 
or sublease. The landlord may require potential replacement tenants to submit an 
application including a credit check. The landlord may also charge a reasonable sublet fee even when you provide the replacement tenants. Normally you remain liable under your lease if the replacement tenants do not pay rent or damage the apartment. Some landlords will release you from the obligations of your lease. If you are being released, get it in writing.

• Joint Leases: One major difference between renting an apartment and renting 
a house is the type of lease. Most apartment complexes offer individual leases. In an 
individual lease you as the leaser are only responsible for the rent money designated to your room, not the entire unit. When renting a house, you will have to sign a joint lease. In a joint lease every signer is responsible for the entirety of the rent so if someone on the lease does not pay their share of the rent the other signers are legally responsible for coming up with the rest of the money for the rent. Make sure to have Student Legal Services, at the Reitz Union, review the lease with you before you sign it so you fully un-derstand your rights and responsibilities.  www.studentlegalservices.ufl.edu 
• 12 month leases:  While a 12 month lease is the norm throughout Gainesville, it is 
particularly rare to find a landlord who offers a lease shorter than 12 months for a rental house. If you are not planning on staying in Gainesville for the entirety of your lease com-mitment (a whole year) you must plan to find a sublease for the semester or months you will be away. 
• Utilities: Most apartment complexes include utilities in their rent or have packages 
available to leasers simplifying the usage of utilities. When renting a house, the leasers are responsible for setting up and paying for their own utilities, cable and internet.  Keep in mind that you might need to pay a deposit for any of these services based on your credit history.  To get average utilities costs for the house you are thinking about renting contact GRU (Gainesville Regional Utilities) www.gru.com  (352) 334-3434.
• Parking: Most houses have their own garage and driveway so you and your room-
mates can park in designated parking areas set up by your landlord.  However some houses only have street parking. Each car that parks in street parking needs a decal for that particular area. Visit the City of Gainesville website to obtain your parking decal www.cityofgainesville.org.  While street parking is generally lifted at night and during weekends you want to make sure you get a decal if you will be parking your car on the street for long periods of time to make sure you do not get ticketed or towed. 
• Crime Statistics: It is always a good idea to check crime statistics for the area in 
which you are planning on renting a house or apartment.  The Gainesville police depart-ment’s website www.gainesvillepd.org has a crime reports map on their front page list-ing different crimes along with when and where they happened.  When you tour houses check for good lighting, well-manicured yards that don’t obscure doors and windows and peepholes in the door.  Also, make sure to always lock your doors and windows when you are leaving your house. 
• Occupancy Ordinance: Gainesville has a particular city ordinance that limits the number of occupants to a rental house to no more than three unrelated people. Es-sentially what that means is you cannot have more than three people living in the same rental house unless two or more of them are family.  If you don’t follow this rule you can face eviction so plan wisely when choosing the number of roommates.  
• Neighbors: Gainesville apartment complexes are leased out to students for the 
most part so it is a valid assumption to expect your neighbors to be students in an apart-ment. However, when you live in a house off campus you may very well live next to a family with children. Because of this you should always get acquainted with your neigh-bors and their habits to minimize the likelihood of issues arising between you and to lessen the chance of somebody calling the police.  Get to know your neighbors you never know you might make a new friend.   
• Noise Ordinance: Noise is something that must be considered no matter where 
you live, however there are more aspects to it when living in a rental house. There is a lot more space between you and your neighbors when you live in a house so it may be tempting to assume you can be as loud as you want. However, Gainesville noise ordinance states any noise that can be heard at a minimum of 200 is considered a dis-turbance. When presented with a noise violation you can receive a citation and fine of over $200 per roommate. 
• Landlord Permit:  Landlords are required to purchase a permit through the City of 
Gainesville that allows them to rent a house.  It is a good idea to make sure that your landlord has a permit before you sign a lease.  Visit the City of Gainesville website www.cityofgainesville.org to check by address or name whether you landlord has a permit.
• Garbage & Recycling:  Houses have both garbage receptacles and recycling bins 
for paper, cans and bottles.  Neighborhoods have a specific garbage and recycling pick up day.  Make sure that your cans and recycling bins are placed at the curb by 7am on your pick up day.  Make sure that you remove garbage cans and recycling bins that same day from the curb.  Also, any overflow garbage must be placed in spe-cial yellow bags that you can purchase from Publix and yard debris must be placed in paper bags that can be purchased at Home Depot and Lowe’s.  To learn more about City of Gainesville garbage disposal and recycling visit the city website at www.cityof-gainesville.org.  Help keep Gainesville clean!

PARTICIPANTS GAINED TWO POUNDS.
ERIKA OAKVIK
Alligator Contributing Writer
UF student Colby Royce knew pulling an all-
nighter for her financial accounting exam wasn’t 
the best idea for her health.
But she didn’t know her lack of sleep could 
potentially cause her to gain weight.
Although people burn more calories when 
sleep deprived, they also tend to overeat, causing weight gain, according to a new study from the University of Colorado Sleep and Chronobiology Laboratory.
The research showed that sleep deprivation 
can cause physiological and behavioral changes to occur, which leads people to eat more.
“When I study late at night, all I drink is 
Starbucks lattes,” said Royce, a 20-year-old finance sophomore. “You’re trying to keep yourself going, so you’re drinking fattening coffees or Red Bulls or eating just to keep yourself awake and doing something.”
In the study, adults were limited to five hours 
of sleep per day for five days. 
On average, participants gained two pounds, 
turning to carbohydrates and fats for the energy boost they needed to stay awake.
Royce said packing healthy snacks or avoiding 
places that sell high-calorie drinks are some ways to combat the potential weight gain if someone plans to get little sleep.
The study showed that with nine hours of 
sleep a night, participants lost the weight they initially gained.
Sarah Martin, a sleep management wellness 
coach at GatorWell Health Promotion Services, said she recommends college students get an average of seven to nine hours of sleep per night.
“Every aspect of your wellness is intertwined,” 
she said. “If something is going poorly in one area, it could hurt the other areas.”WEDNESDAY, MARCH 13, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 25

presented crime rate changes from 2010 to 2012.
Property crime, which includes 
burglary, larceny and auto theft, de-creased by 2.77 percent since 2010.
Homicide, rape, robbery and ag-
gravated assault cases — all under the violent crime umbrella — saw a slight increase from 2010 to 2011, but a 6.06 percent decrease from 2011 to 2012.
In the first two months of 
2013, violent and property crimes dropped 7.1 percent compared to the same time last year.
The presentation highlighted 
high-profile crimes from 2012, which included the Christian Agui-lar investigation.
The department also unveiled 
a new citizen surveillance initia-tive called “Step Up, Stop Crime!,” which encourages citizens to dial 911 if they see suspicious activity.
“When you see something that 
you think is out of place or that may be suspicious, it probably is,” said GPD spokesman Officer Ben Tobi-as. “We would rather you give us a call than to have suspicious activity turn into crime.”
GPD Chief Tony Jones said his 
department will spend the rest of the year focused on community outreach.
“I want to see our officers out of 
their cars and meeting people face to face,” he said. “Making these contacts with the citizens is very important in reducing crime.”

A TOP-FIVE SELECTION IN THE 2013 NFL DRAFT.
PHILLIP HEILMAN
Alligator Staff Writer
Nobody is second-guessing 
Sharrif Floyd’s decision to leave 
UF early these days. 
Floyd, who announced his in-
tention to forgo his senior season following Florida’s 33-23 loss to Louisville in the Sugar Bowl on Jan. 2, has seen his draft stock rise meteorically during the past few weeks.
The 6-foot-3, 297-pound defen-
sive lineman is now considered a potential top-five pick in the NFL Draft, which begins on April 25. 
Despite not attending Florida’s 
Pro Day on Tuesday — Floyd tweaked his ankle at the NFL Scouting Combine and will hold a private workout later this month — scouts and coaches raved about his ability to command double teams and cause chaos for oppos-ing offenses. 
“He’s a game-changer at 
the college level,” said David Caldwell, general manager of the Jacksonville Jaguars. “He may not have the so-called sack pro-duction, but he disrupts a lot of plays.” 
Floyd’s raw statistics from last 
season do not fully reflect the at-tention he has received since an-nouncing his decision.
He finished fifth on the team 
with 46 tackles, 13 of which went for a loss, and also notched three sacks in 13 games during his ju-nior season.
But in Florida’s loss to Louis-
ville, Floyd recorded five tackles, two sacks and a blocked field goal. Coach Will Muschamp said that type of production was there throughout the season, even if the box score showed differently.  
“Turn on the tape,” Muschamp 
said. “The guy can anchor, he can play the run, he’s got great initial quickness, he can rush the passer. He’s everything you want for an inside player.” 
Floyd is one of seven starters 
the Gators must replace from a defense that finished fifth in the nation with 14.5 points per game allowed. 
Despite the departures, first-
year defensive coordinator D.J. Durkin is confident in what the team is bringing back next sea-son.
“We’re not just playing 11 
guys,” Durkin said. “We play 20-something guys in a game on defense, and we want to continue that. We’ve got some up-and-coming guys we feel really good about.”
Purifoy working with offense:  
Muschamp said on Tuesday that 
cornerback Loucheiz Purifoy, who will be a junior next season, will play the first seven days of spring practice as a full-time wide receiver. 
Purifoy finished fourth on the 
team last season with 38 tackles while also forcing three fumbles and breaking up five passes. But given his athleticism and Flori-da’s lack of depth at receiver, the coaching staff has opted to incor-porate him into the offense. 
“A guy that hasn’t been full 
time at that position, so it would be good for him to go through the first seven days [at receiver],” Muschamp said.Added offensive coordinator 
Brent Pease: “We know he’s a de-fensive guy, but when you have a talent like him… he can step on the field and give us something offensively.”
Injuries: Ronald Powell will not 
participate in spring practice as he continues his recovery after suffering a torn ACL in Florida’s spring game and undergoing a second surgery to repair his knee in October. 
Offensive linemen Chaz Green 
(ankle) and Ian Silberman (shoul-der) will also miss spring practice, as will freshman linebacker Matt Rolin (knee). Kyle Christy, Nei-ron Ball, Solomon Patton and Jon Halapio will be limited partici-pants as they return to full speed. 
“We’re going to be a little 
thin up front with some injuries, so we’ve got to be more efficient throwing it, and that’s going to be a big part of it in spring,” Mus-champ said.

The Gators and the Seminoles have re-
versed roles.
No. 5 Florida State (16-0) defeated Flor-
ida (8-10) 4-1 Tuesday night at McKethan 
Stadium. The Seminoles won their first game in Gainesville since 2007. Coach Kev-in O’Sullivan hadn’t lost at home to Florida State in five previous matchups.
Right-hander Luke Weaver earned the 
win with 6.1 innings of one-run ball. Semi-noles coach Mike Martin, known for his numerous mound visits, didn’t make one until the seventh inning.
“When you look at the game, you start 
with pitching,” Martin said. “There’s no question that was the difference in the ball-game.”Indiana left-hander Joey DeNato al-
lowed one run in 7.1 innings against Florida on Friday. Florida Gulf Coast right-hander Ricky Knapp tossed a complete game on Feb. 22. Weaver matched their performanc-es at the Mac. Weaver threw all three of his pitches — fastball, changeup and curveball — for strikes.
“It’s tough. You just got to try and pick 
one out,” Justin Shafer said. “You can’t try to hit all three. We didn’t adjust well to-night.”
Three relievers followed Weaver to shut 
out the Gators for the last three innings. Florida didn’t get a runner to second base until the fourth and went 1 for 7 with run-ners in scoring position. 
Taylor Gushue brought in the only run 
for Florida on an error by Weaver, who couldn’t haul in an underhand flip while covering first base on a ground ball. With the bases loaded and two outs, Florida State

Through the first 16 games of the sea-
son, Danny Young had thrown fewer in-
nings than any Florida pitcher aside from Bobby Poyner, who didn’t make his first appearance of the season until Sunday.
Even though Young had just 2.2 innings 
under his belt heading into the Tuesday night’s game with undefeated FSU, coach Kevin O’Sullivan felt comfortable giving him the start.
The freshman left-hander pitched a 
scoreless ninth inning in Sunday’s 7-4 loss to Indiana, and O’Sullivan thought he threw the ball with conviction, so he want-ed to give him a shot.
“He threw the ball really good,” 
O’Sullivan said of Young’s game against FSU. “Probably ran his pitch count up a little too high, but he threw strikes. I was really pleased with how he performed.”
In 3.1 innings of work, Young gave up 
three hits and struck out a career-high three batters. He allowed three runs, but left the game with two of those runners still on base. After giving up a run in the first inning, Young retired the Seminoles in order in the second by striking out both John Nogowski and Jose Brizuela looking and forcing Giovanny Alfonzo to ground out to the pitcher’s mound.
“Did a great job for his first time,” 
freshman outfielder Harrison Bader said. “To sort of be thrown out there, he did a really really good job.”
Simpson used in relief: Freshman Tucker 
Simpson, who has started every Saturday 
game for the Gators in 2013, made his first relief appearance of the season on Tues-day. 
“He only threw 45 pitches on Satur-
day, so I wanted to get him some work,” O’Sullivan said.
Simpson relieved junior left-hander 
Daniel Gibson to begin the seventh inning and retired the Seminoles in order on eight pitches. 
O’Sullivan said prior to the season that 
he would use non-conference play to set his weekend rotation before the Gators begin Southeastern Conference play. With Kentucky coming to Gainesville this week-end, O’Sullivan said the rotation would be determined on Wednesday. 
“Obviously, (freshman Jay) Carmi-
chael has been throwing the ball good,” O’Sullivan said.  “Crawford is one of those guys, and I like the way (Eric) Hanhold threw the ball, too.”
Simpson threw just 17 total pitches 
against FSU, so he could still be available to start against Kentucky as well.
In four starts prior to Tuesday, Simpson 
pitched 15 innings, allowed 16 hits and struck out 13 batters while posting an ERA of 5.40. Carmichael leads the team with an ERA of 2.00 and has allowed just four runs in 18 innings of work.
Powers returns: Gators third baseman 
Zack Powers returned to the starting lineup against FSU after missing last weekend’s series against Indiana due to a bruised hand suffered in Florida’s 7-6 win over Jacksonville last Wednesday.
Powers, who led the team before Tues-
day with a .418 on-base percentage, is tied for first in home runs and second in RBI, went 0 for 4 at the plate against FSU with three strikeouts.
O’Sullivan said the sophomore was still 
battling discomfort in the hand.
“He grinded through it,” O’Sullivan 
said.
“Obviously, I don’t think it’s 100 per-
cent. It’s not broken. He battled tonight. He did what he could. He hung in there. I know he really wanted to play tonight, so we’ll give him off the next couple days, and I’m sure he’ll feel much better by Fri-day.”

Left-handed pitcher Danny Young (15) warms up between innings during Florida’s 4-1 loss to Florida State on Tuesday night 
at McKethan Stadium. The freshman made his first college start against the fifth-ranked Seminoles.
Baseball Notebook: Freshman makes first career start
Gators scored only run against Seminoles on fielding error
right-hander Robby Coles induced 
a weak groundball to shortstop from Vickash Ramjit to end the eighth and Florida’s last gasp.
Florida hosts No. 10 Kentucky 
on Friday to open Southeastern Conference play. 
“It doesn’t matter SEC or 
whomever we are playing on Fri-day,” O’Sullivan said. “We got to do a better job offensively. I think we hit three balls hard all night. Let’s face it. We got some work to do offensively.”
While Florida’s bats stayed qui-
et, Florida State did just enough. Shortstop Giovanny Alfonzo hit an 0-2 fastball from right-hander Ryan Harris in the fourth for a two-run single. Alfonzo gave Florida State a three-run lead. The Seminoles added another run in the sixth when Harris hit Josh Delph with the bases loaded. Har-ris started the inning by hitting John Nogowski, who eventually scored.
Florida State reached base 
in seven at-bats with two-strike counts. Tuesday’s loss marks the earliest Florida has reached dou-ble-digit defeats in seven seasons. The last time the Gators reached 10 losses that quickly was the 2007 campaign — the final year before O’Sullivan’s arrival at UF. 
Freshman centerfielder Har-
rison Bader faced the media after the game in front of Florida’s dug-out. The questions sounded famil-iar. It’s been tough for Florida. The work hasn’t translated into wins.
“We’re fighting out there,” 
Bader said. “We’re never going to quit... As long as I’m on the field, as long as anybody is on the field we are going to put everything into it.”
Gators lose pitcher: Junior right-
hander Keenan Kish will miss the season due to a hip injury. He un-derwent hip surgery during the summer and didn’t participate in fall practice due to hip issues as well. Kish finishes 2013 with a 3.38 ERA in three appearances. He started against UCF and North Florida. His last appearance came on Feb. 26 against the Ospreys.

� THE GATORS BEGAN THE 
GAME ON A 15-0 RUN.

Alligator Writer
Coach Amanda O’Leary could not 
have asked her team for more during 
Tuesday night’s performance against Lehigh.
The second-ranked Gators (10-0) put 
up their best offensive and defensive performances of the season in an 18-2 blowout of the Mountain Hawks (2-4).
Florida captured momentum early 
by scoring seven goals in less than 9 minutes to open the contest.
UF continued its hot streak, jogging 
off the field at halftime with a 14-0 lead. The 14 goals were the most the Gators have scored in a half this season. Florida shut out an opponent in the first half for the second time.
“It’s a great feeling to have a shutout 
in that first half, but we knew we had to keep the intensity up,” senior defender Sam Farrell said.
The Gators maintained their inten-
sity despite resting Farrell and the rest of the starting lineup during the second half.The final 30 minutes featured an en-
tirely new lineup while all the regular starters and substitutes stood on the sideline.
“The first team came off, and the 
second team came in and there was no drop off, which was really great to see,” O’Leary said.
Redshirt junior Erin Graziano added 
a goal in the second half to extend the Gators’ run to 15 straight goals before the Mountain Hawks finally answered with a goal of their own to avoid a shut-out. The 15-0 run was the largest for Florida this season.
“It feels good to know that our of-
fense can generate so many goals and so many unassisted goals,” sophomore Nora Barry said.
UF achieved season-high marks 
with 26 points, 10 assists, 38 shots and 29 shots on goal. 
“Overall, we just played our game,” 
Barry said.
Twelve different Gators found the 
back of the net. Seven were freshmen.
Of the 12 freshmen on the team, 11 
logged minutes on Tuesday. 
O’Leary was glad the freshmen 
earned some game experience in the victory against Lehigh.
“They are the future.,” she said. No. 2 Florida tops Lehighsoftball

Briana Little struggled in limited playing 
time in 2012, hitting just .188 in 35 games. She 
hit only one home run in 32 at-bats.
Through 27 games in 2013, Little has 
quickly surpassed those marks. In victories against No. 4 Alabama and Auburn during the weekend, Little hit .667 with a home run and four RBI.
The Southeastern Conference named her 
the league’s player of the 
week for her efforts.
“She had one of the 
best weeks she’s had in her whole entire career,” coach Tim Walton said.
Little got on base the 
hard way against the Ti-gers. She was hit by three pitches during the three-
game series, including two in Florida’s 2-0 victory on Sunday. Little did not record an official at-bat, as she drew a walk in her only other plate appearance.
“I just felt they tried to work around me 
the best way they could,” Little said.
The Gators record for hit-by-pitches in a 
season is 15, set by Francesca Enea in 2010.
When Little wasn’t being hit or pitched 
around, she was punishing the pitchers who threw in the strike zone.
In addition to her home run, she hit a dou-ble and five singles, including a run-scoring base hit in Florida’s 13-0 blowout against Au-burn on Friday.
She recorded a slugging percentage of 
1.111 and a .786 on-base percentage in the four games.
“She just found a way to get on base a lot,” 
Walton said. “A lot of two-out hits. She had a really, really, really good week. We were proud of her.”
The sophomore outfielder currently leads 
No. 3 Florida  (25-2, 2-1 SEC) in OPS and ranks second on the team with five home runs this season.
“When I get my at-bats, I just went up 
there and looked for good pitches to hit,” Little said. “I just try to get on for my team.”
Gators move up in polls: Florida moved up 
one spot in both the ESPN/USA Softball and National Fastpitch Coaches Association polls this week.    The Gators defeated the previously top-ranked Crimson Tide in Tuscaloosa, Ala., and took two of three from the Tigers on the road. 
Florida’s next opponent is No. 6 Tennessee 
(21-4, 2-1 SEC), which moved up two spots after winning two of three against Alabama.
“It was a tough week,” Walton said. “It 
was a long week for us, but I felt very pleased with the way our team played.”
