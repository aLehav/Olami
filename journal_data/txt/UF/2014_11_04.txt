Lines shouldn’t be long as voters wait 
to cast their ballots for state governor, lo-
cal representatives and measures includ-ing upping conservation funding and le-galizing medical marijuana today.
Polls are open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., 
but Supervisor of County Elections Pam 
Carpenter said voters can still cast their 
ballots at their designated precinct after 7 p.m. today as long as they were in line when polls initially closed. 
Carpenter said nearly 18,000 residents 
cast early ballots this year, which should keep election-day polling lines short.
About the same amount of people 
also sent in absentee ballots, which Car-
penter said will be collected until 7 p.m. 
today, the same time polls close.The number of early and absentee 
votes this year saw a signiﬁ  cant increase compared to the number Carpenter said Alachua County received in 2010.
“More and more people seem to be 
taking advantage of the ﬂ  exibility that the early voting process has offered them,” she said.
In order to vote, Florida requires 
people carry a signed picture ID to the 
polls. Voters can use their driver’s li-
cense, Florida ID card, student ID card or another government-issued form of identiﬁ  cation, she said. Voters can also 
use two different IDs – one photo, one 
signature – in order to meet the require-ments.
If someone does not have the proper 
identiﬁ  cation, Carpenter said people can Voters can enter their addresses on Vote Alachua’s website to view their

Russ Dye, 54, sits near his tent outside Grace Marketplace on Monday in four layers of clothes to shelter him from the cold. Dye 
said about 25 people at the shelter still need blankets and coats to bear the drop in temperatures.

Alligator Staff Writer cherrera@alligator.org
Deep in four layers of clothes, Russ Dye sat 
by an extinguished campﬁ  re outside homeless 
shelter Grace Marketplace on Monday as the temperature tiptoed just above 60 degrees.
Two sweatshirts, two T-shirts, a pair of 
shorts and sweatpants kept Dye, 54, from freezing the night before when temperatures across Gainesville dipped below 40 degrees. 
Still, Dye is one of the lucky ones. Of the 
more than 100 people who come to Grace Mar-ketplace every day, Dye said about a quarter of them are not adequately prepared for the cooler months. 
The shelter started seeking donations as 
temperatures threatened to drop last weekend facing Friday’s cold front, said Jon DeCarmine, operations director for the Alachua County Coalition for the Homeless and Hungry. 
“I was incredibly grateful on Friday,” De-
Carmine said. “We kept having people come by our ofﬁ  ce and dropping stuff off. Between all of them we had enough to get through this weekend, but we could always use more.”
DeCarmine said the shelter, located at 2845 
NE 39th St., is in great need of blankets and 
thick jackets – the bulkier, the better. He esti-
mated hundreds more will be needed to get through the winter. 
“It becomes a very severe situation very 
quickly,” he said. 
As of now, Grace has a cold-night program 
that allows people access to the shelter once 
temperatures drop below 45 degrees. A paper 
taped to the ofﬁ  ce desk Monday read, “Satur-day night temps in the 30s! Be prepared!” 
Helping them with their preparations was

Students riding the bus or bik-
ing to campus may want to whip 
out the keys — gas prices have 
plummeted below $3 per gallon 
for the ﬁ  rst time since December 2010.
The national average Monday 
was $2.98, while Florida’s aver-age price has fallen to $2.96 per gallon, according to the American Automobile Association.
“I remember saying a few years 
ago that we would never see sub-$3 gallons of gas,” said Chris Mc-Carty, director of UF’s Bureau of Economic and Business Research. 
“I was pretty wrong about that.”
National prices at the pump 
plunged 33 cents in October, 
marking the sharpest decline since 2008.
Florida’s current average of 
$2.96 is 8 cents less than it was a week ago. Local gas stations are seeing the change, too.
“A big part of the decline is 
due to a decline in demand, and that typically happens in the fall after Labor Day,” McCarty said. 
“When all the summer travel is 
over and kids are back in school, 
people don’t travel as much.”
McCarty said another reason 
prices are dropping is because there’s more oil available interna-
tionally and domestically.
One practice that has contrib-uted to this is hydraulic fractur-
ing, which involves drilling and 
injecting ﬂ  uid into the ground at a high pressure in order to fracture shale rocks to release oil and natu-
ral gas.
“It’s extremely controversial,” 
he said. “People worry about the chemicals that are being pushed down into the ground and water 
supply, but nevertheless, there’s no doubt it generates oil that we previously didn’t have.”
The recent lack of hurricanes 
has also contributed to the falling prices, McCarty said, because oil reﬁ  neries in Texas and Louisiana 
have been able to operate without 
disruption.
Tommy Myers, an employee at 
the Kangaroo Express at 3525 SW 
34th St., said the decrease in gas 
prices has increased competition among local gas stations for cus-tomers.
Myers’ store was selling regu-
lar gas for $2.97 per gallon Mon-day.
“We’ve been monitoring prices 
every hour on the hour,” Myers said.
Myers said the store’s low gas 
prices are a way to encourage cus-tomers to buy other products like 
hot cakes, drinks and cigarettes.  
“I’ve seen a huge increase in 
people,” he said.
If the nation’s current eco-
nomic recovery stays as strong as 
some predict it will next year, it could lead to less demand and a continued decrease in prices, but McCarty doesn’t necessarily think 
that will happen.
“I can’t imagine them getting 
down to $2, but maybe I’ll be 
wrong,” he said.TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 4, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 3

Farjs said he has prepared 
26 beds with warm blankets 
in an open yet roofed pavilion 
and about 20 more beds inside the cold-night shelter. He has seen a 10-percent increase in breakfast attendance since the cold front, up from the usual 40 or 45 people.
“I envision it being more as 
we get colder weather,” Farjs 
said. 
UF President Bernie Ma-
chen, who joined the oversight 
board for Grace Marketplace last month, said preparing the homeless community for the cold is crucial. 
“With winter coming on, 
clothing and shelter becomes a 
top priority,” he said. “I think 
the community can be mobi-lized to help provide some ad-ditional resources there.” 
Machen became the first 
non-local-government-affiliat-ed member to join the board in hopes of getting more engaged in the community and adding a 
new perspective to the board. 
He and his wife, Chris, who founded the Gainesville St. Francis House’s pet care clinic, have been involved with help-ing the homeless community for many years, he said. 
“Maybe I can be a liaison to 
the community to help us get 
more involved,” Machen said. On Monday afternoon, 
Grace Marketplace continued 
to bustle with people walking 
in and out of the gates that sep-
arate it from adjacent tent city Dignity Village, where Dye and his dog, Ginger, live. 
Dye sat smoking a menthol-
flavored cigar with a face-down copy of children’s book Song of the Wanderer by Bruce Coville nearby. He was bundled up in a 
gray Aeropostale sweater, and 
an Occupy Gainesville pin was clipped to his camouflage cap. 
The Seattle-native said most 
people are not prepared for cold temperatures in Florida. Many came to Gainesville from northern states in the last few weeks to escape the cold. 
“They’re new to it,” he said. 
“They’re not expecting it to be cold. This is Florida.” 
At night, he sees them hud-
dle by the fire.
Another resident, Gus John-
son, echoed Dye’s concerns. Blankets get stolen, said John-son, 66. Traffic at the center has 
increased dramatically since 
the cold settled in. Still, the 
Philadelphia-native said Grace 
Marketplace is a luxury for those who attend. 
“If I were to bring five peo-
ple from up north down here they’d say, ‘Wow, this is home-less? Man, I’ll be right back I need to go get my stuff,’” John-son said.  
“There’s a lot of people who 
don’t have this blessing what-soever.” 4, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 4, 2014

“This is going to be my first

Carpenter said poll lines will 
be busiest early in the morning, during lunch hour and in the evening when most people are getting out of work.

Passionate is a word his peers and supervi-
sors have used to describe him. UF alumnus Sean 
Russell’s passion for the environment and youth 
leadership led him to win a national award at the 
age of 22.
In October, Russell won the 2014 Brower 
Youth Award for his environmental work in de-
creasing marine debris like fishing line gear.
Each year, the Brower Youth Award selects 
six environmental leaders between the ages of 13 
and 22.
All recipients win a mon-
etary award that has no 
spending requirements. Sean received $3,000 for his Stow It-Don’t Throw It project.
As a North Port, Florida, 
native, Russell grew up next to the beach and fell in love with the marine life.
His passion for marine life 
grew during his high school internship at Mote Marine Laboratory in Sarasota where he saw the devastating effects fishing line and other marine debris had on the environment firsthand.
Through the program, Russell collaborated 
with Kim Bassos-Hull, a senior biologist at the laboratory, on her project recycling old tennis ball containers into recycling bins for fishing line.He then created the Stow It-Don’t Throw It 
project to make the containers on a larger scale and spread awareness about marine debris pre-
vention.
He brought the project to his local 4-H club 
to get students involved in the volunteer work. 
Started in 2006, the project has now spread to 12 
states, including Alaska.
Russell said he wants to expand the project to 
every state and eventually internationally.
Shaumond Scott, the state 4-H communica-
tions coordinator, said Russell’s passion will pro-pel him to further his environmental work.
“If he sets it as a goal, then he’s coming for 
it,” Scott said. “But, whatever it is, I know it’s not 
going to be about himself. It’s going to be about 
how he can help others and the environment.”
As a homeschooled student, Russell said he 
actively sought ways to get involved with other 
students and adults.  
He decided to organize the Youth Ocean Con-
servation Summit, an annual event held at the Mote Marine Laboratory. Russell is still actively working to expand the summit to various states in the coming years.
Russell is now interning with the University 
of Georgia Marine Extension Service.
Bassos-Hall said Russell set a goal to expand 
the project and did it in a way not many could because of his proactive spirit.
“He’s just an idea kid,” she said.Alum wins environmental award
◗ TUITION RATES MAY 
CHANGE FOR FIVE PRO-GRAMS.
ARIANA FIGUEROA
Alligator Staff Writer afigueroa@alligator.org
Tuition rate proposals and tenure 
upon hire for future UF President 
Kent Fuchs were discussed at Mon-day’s UF Board of Trustees meeting.
The UF Board of Trustees and its 
Committee on Educational Policy and Strategy met to discuss the two action items.
The committee voted unanimous-
ly to approve the UF President-elect’s tenure.
Joseph Glover, provost and se-
nior vice president for academic af-fairs, asked the board to approve the 
expected tuition rates for five pro-
grams.
The five programs are the Master 
of Science in Microbiology and Cell Science, with a Concentration in Med-ical Microbiology and Chemistry, Master of Arts in Arts in Medicine, Masters of Science in Pharmacy with Concentration in Clinical Toxicology, Doctor of Pharmacy and College of Medicine Medical Doctor.
Glover said the trustees’ approval 
is needed before the Board of Gover-nors can consider approving the mar-ket price for the five programs.
“They will be priced at the going 
rate people are willing to pay,” Glover 
said.
In some cases, the market price 
for tuition is higher than the normal 
tuition rate at UF, but in some cases, it’s lower.
“This request will not affect the 
residential tuition of any students,” Glover said.  
For example, the market tuition 
price of the doctors for medicine pro-gram for out-of-state residents will be lower than the university’s current tuition rates, Glover said.
If the proposal is approved, the 
College of Medicine will reprice the out-of-state students at the going market rate from $65,000 to possibly $45,000.
The board voted unanimously to 
approve the five programs for market rate status.Board of Trustees talks

Stephen A. Smith, sports analyst, radio host and co-host of 
the ESPN show “First Take,” will bring his outspokenness to 
UF next week.
As part of the Accent Speaker’s Bureau event, Smith will 
speak at the Phillips Center for the Performing Arts at 8 p.m. on Nov. 12.  
The event is free and open to the general public. Doors will 
open at 7 p.m.
Corey Flayman, chairman of Accent, said requests from 
students led the organization to invite him as a speaker.
“He’s one of the most well-known and prominent ESPN commentators,” Flayman said. “We think that he brings a great mix of both sports 
commentary and entertainment.”
Accent paid Smith $26,500 to speak, 
Flayman said.
Smith started at ESPN in 2003 as an ana-
lyst for “NBA Shootaround,” now called 
“NBA Countdown.”
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted “Quite 
Frankly with Stephen A. Smith,” a daily, hourlong talk 
show.
In addition to co-hosting on “First Take,” which airs week-
days at 10 a.m., Smith hosts an ESPN radio show and writes a 
column for ESPNNewYork.com.Flayman said students who have an interest in sports and 
news media can learn from Smith’s professional experience.
UF telecommunication senior Bonnie Mott, 22, said she is 
looking forward to hearing more about Smith’s career.
“I think he’s one of the most prominent and influential 
sports analysts, so I’m looking forward to hearing about his 
journey to ESPN and what his career is like on a day-to-day 
basis,” Mott said. “I admire how he isn’t afraid to tell it like 
it is, and it’s clear that he’s never been afraid of chasing his 
dreams.”
Students can participate in a Q-and-A after the speech.
“He’s so outspoken on many issues,” Flayman said. “I 
think, with that in mind, that he will bring an interesting per-
spective to the university.”ESPN host Stephen A. Smith to speak on campus next week

People in Alachua County can now text 911 dis-
patch from their cell phones, eliminating the need 
to speak when reporting an emergency.
Dispatch teamed up with the Alachua County 
Sheriff’s Office Combined Communications Center 
to provide the service.
Cell phone providers AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile 
and Verizon Wireless support the service — a 
speak-free feature that can prove valuable for cer-tain issues, like domestic violence.When sending an emergency text, people need 
to state the location of the emergency and the in-cident itself. Messages should be brief and concise, and each should avoid the use of abbreviations.
The new service comes with a few warnings, ac-
cording to a press release. There can be delays in message delivery, and there is no guarantee the message will be received by dispatch. But in some cases, a text to police is more practical, like for those with hearing problems or speech limitations.
The Federal Communications Commission 
urges people to think of texting 911 as more of a complement to a phone call rather than a substitute. Cell phone carriers and text message providers are 
required to carry text-to-911 before the end of the 
year. Texting 911 available in county

White, an American stand-up comedian 
and actor, will begin his nationwide “Nut-cracker” tour at the Phillips Center for the Performing Arts at 7:30 p.m.
“We, AEG Live, always look forward to 
working with him,” John Valentino, Anschutz Entertainment Group promoter, said. “He’s one of the best in the business, and he always deliverers, and to see the exchange between 
him and his fans is always a delight.”
White is best known as a charter member 
of the Blue Collar Comedy Tour.

becca Lorenzo said students and the general public can still buy tickets at the Phillips Cen-
ter or online for $67, the only price left for purchase.
Tickets have been on sale since July 18.
VIP ticket holders can participate in a Q-

A Gainesville man was arrested 
Sunday night after police said a 
tube of crack fell from his pants.
Jake C. Young, 23, was pulled 
over shortly before 8 p.m. for fail-ing to stop before entering a road-way at 1300 E. University Ave. He 
had a suspended driver’s license 
and police said he smelled of mari-juana.
Officers had Young get out of 
the car to conduct a search when 
police said a plastic cigar tube 
filled with 30 crack rocks fell from between his buttcheeks and down his pants.Young was arrested on charges 
of possession of crack-cocaine with intent to sell and drug parapherna-lia. His bond is set at $17,500.

Police received a phone call 
from a Sonic employee that after-

Reddish’s breath smelled strongly of chewing tobacco, they were still able to smell alcohol while stand-ing out in the open air. Reddish 
had bloodshot, watery eyes and 
slurred speech.
He performed poorly on field 
sobriety exercises and refused to 
give a breath sample.
Reddish was arrested on charg-

Vote or post a message at www.alligator.orgMonday’s question: Do you think the 
Gators will beat the Seminoles? Today’s question: Are you voting today?As more states begin to establish policies that rely 
on fear and fear alone, it is clear that the conver-sation about Ebola in America has spiraled out of 
control.
Thankfully, one determined nurse has decided to fight 
back.
Kaci Hickox is facing severe criticism from politicians 
and the public after openly defying her state’s new quar-antine policy, which orders health care workers returning from West Africa to stay isolated in their homes for 21 days.
Hickox attracted national attention after she arrived in 
a New Jersey airport on the day that the state established the new quarantine mandate. Despite testing negative for Ebola and showing no symptoms of the disease, Hickox was forced to stay as a “patient” in an isolated tent close to a hospital for three days. Although she could use the In-ternet through her cell phone, she had no access to a televi-sion, shower facility or a flush toilet.
Eventually, she was allowed to return to her home in 
Maine, but the state ordered her to remain in her house for the rest of the quarantine period.
Fear and hysteria strike again. Politicians have an obli-
gation to make their communities safe, but under no cir-cumstances should they craft policies that ignore medical facts. Ebola is not contagious unless the carrier is showing symptoms, and it is only spread through direct contact with bodily fluids. This explains why Thomas Duncan, the first man to die in America from Ebola, did not spread the infection to his relatives or his fiancee.
How, then, can lawmakers justify isolating health 
care workers who show no symptoms and test negative for Ebola? Instead of applauding Hickox for standing up for logic and science, she has been heavily scrutinized by people who seem to have forgotten both.
Outraged commenters and social media users have 
blasted Hickox for what they interpret as a selfish and ir-responsible decision. Many people have even expressed hope that she will be thrown in jail, have her health care license revoked and be physically forced into isolation. Even the governor of Maine has accused the nurse of be-ing untrustworthy.
These are profoundly ignorant opinions. They are espe-
cially infuriating when you consider how Hickox is doing more to prevent the spread of Ebola than all of the angry commenters put together. Selfish and irresponsible people do not risk their lives to help combat the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. Selfish and irresponsible people do not en-dure terrifying and grueling ordeals in an impoverished country to treat the sick.
Refusing to submit to policies that do nothing but com-
fort the hysterical and uninformed does not mean she is selfish. It means she is brave.
Unfortunately, the sharp criticism surrounding Hickox 
indicates the kind of treatment awaiting many health care workers who will soon return from West Africa. Consider-ing the careless manner in which state officials reacted to the nurse’s reasonable pleas, it is disturbing to think about how they will handle the upcoming arrival of exhausted doctors and nurses.
When Hickox threatened to sue New Jersey Gov. Chris 
Christie over her mandatory isolation in a tent, his re-sponse reflected just how little he respects her: “Whatever, get in line.” Is his attitude going to remain this indifferent toward every other health care worker forced into quaran-tine? I certainly hope not.
Fear can hold a dangerous and powerful grip on a na-
tion. As tempting as it may be to succumb to hysteria, we must listen to Kaci Hickox and rely on science and logic.
After all, if we allow ourselves to become a nation 
where fear is more powerful than the facts, we will never stop being afraid.

Don’t be a cynic; 
go vote
After months of campaigning, millions of dollars spent on 
political advertising and countless debates, scandals and controversies, Election Day 2014 is finally here.
The elections that take place today will play a large role in 
determining the direction of our state and our nation for at least 
the next two years. If Republicans take control of the U.S. Sen-
ate, as they are projected to, the gridlock and partisanship that plague our nation’s capital will only increase. Even if Democrats hold the upper chamber, the prospects for any sort of substan-tive progress on our nation’s most important issues seem bleak.
However, the polarization that plagues Washington is not an 
excuse to avoid voting. Floridians will decide on a number of important items today that will have major implications at the state level regardless of what happens in D.C.
Many have dismissed the governor’s race between Repub-
lican incumbent Rick Scott and Democratic challenger Charlie Crist as a matter of choosing the lesser of two evils.
However, the reality is that Crist and Scott have vastly dif-
ferent opinions and visions on nearly every issue important to Florida: education, climate change, taxes and the environment, just to name a few.
Although gridlock also exists at the state level, it is much 
less severe than in the U.S. Congress. Regardless of which can-
didate is elected and which party controls the state legislature, 
it is very likely the new governor will see major components of his agenda enacted. Simply put, the governor’s race is extremely important for Florida’s future. It is also likely to be an extremely close election, so every vote really does count.
The three constitutional amendments up for approval by 
Florida voters also have significant implications for the state’s environment, health care system and courts.
Regardless of your political affiliation or the issues that moti-
vate you most, voting is essential. Florida’s college students are a critical part of the Sunshine State’s future.  We deserve a say in the direction of our state, but that only happens if we go out and vote in large numbers.
If you need more information about any of the items on the 
Florida ballot this year, the League of Women Voters has an excel-lent, nonpartisan guide to the various races and ballot initiatives on its website at thefloridavoter.org. You can also visit alligator.org to read all of our election coverage and our endorsements for

A car horn blares as it zips past 
me and my friend while we stand at a bus stop.
“Hey, you got a boyfriend?” A man 
shouted as he ﬂ  ew down the hill on his bicycle.
“Dang, that’s a ﬁ  -i-i-i-ine white girl,” 
another said as he walked past.
All three of these audible blasts col-
lided with my ears in a 24-hour period this weekend. While the above expe-riences vary in severity, each one made my blood 
boil.
Women should not have to tolerate abrasive, 
abrupt insults that are supposedly compliments. 
Catcalls are obnoxious, rude, sexist and objectify-
ing.
First, catcalls are obnoxious and rude by nature. 
One moment, a woman is walking from point A to 
point B. 
The next moment she has to hear a complete 
stranger publicly address her physical appearance in passing.
Whether this is something slightly more ﬂ  atter-
ing and less sexual like “Do you have a boyfriend?,” 
catcalls cross a verbal barrier and violate personal 
space.
The jeering remarks are frustrating and unset-
tling.
Often, I want to yell back in retaliation. Howev-
er, this can be unnerving because once someone has verbally objectiﬁ  ed me, it makes me wary of how they may return any protestation.  
Furthermore, catcalls are sexist.
While catcalls can apply to men or women in any 
combination, in my personal experience, women 
seem to always be on the receiving end of catcalls.
These inappropriate remarks harass females. 
Whether a woman is wearing a full-length coat or 
a bathing suit, the statements are always inappro-
priate.
Men who catcall are claiming dominance and 
authority over complete strangers simply because 
they’re female. 
Asserting an opinion on physical appearance 
implies dominance because the speaker assumes he 
has the right to commentate.
Finally, catcalls objectify women. When a man 
catcalls, he makes a woman an object for visual en-joyment and nothing more.These unwelcome statements are de-
humanizing because they disregard ev-erything except appearance, devaluing 
personality, interests and everything 
else that make a woman who she is. 
Catcalls have made me feel like I am 
just my sex or my race, not an actual 
person.
As a side note, being attracted to 
someone is acceptable. 
However, there are appropriate ways 
to show this attraction. Compliments like, “You look nice today” and jeering remarks shouted from 
a car window are different things.
In addition, there is a difference between look-
ing and leering. Leering is like the silent form of a 
catcall.
Finding someone nice to look at is understand-
able. Look. Be pleasantly surprised by the good for-
tune of encountering a lovely human being. Do not stare. This goes for guys as well as girls.
In high school, I went to a restaurant with some 
girl friends. 
When we went to the register at the front, two 
men seated by the register stared at us while we 
paid the cashier.
As we walked out the door, they swiveled on 
their bar stools to watch us leave the establishment. 
I felt violated and was disgusted.
Leering after someone no longer compliments 
him or her like a ﬂ  irtatious glance from across a room might.
The intent behind a look or a statement is the de-
ciding factor in the compliment or catcall debate.
Compliments from people who are not strang-
ers, respectful interested glances and other forms of expressing attraction can be very appropriate and helpful for communicating interest.
Outright catcalls, however, are never appropri-
ate.
To conclude – catcalls startle, demean and objec-
tify. They suggest a woman is just a body.
 It is not OK that women have to face harassment 
with a this-is-just-something-I-have-to-deal-with mindset.
Women should be able to walk, skip, jog, run or 
strut down a street without having to deal with un-wanted attention. Catcalls need to be silenced.

opinions@alligator.orgAs it looks 
more and more likely 
that the Republi-cans will seize con-
trol of the Senate 
on Tuesday (if not in January after runoff elections in Georgia and Louisiana), many Demo-crats are losing hope that any of their political priorities will be accomplished in the next two years. Given a deeply un-popular president, a base that is 
much less likely to turn out in 
the midterms than in presiden-tial elections and a battleground consisting for the most part of conservative, southern states that went for Mitt Romney in 2012, this shouldn’t be a sur-prise. But even acknowledging the Democrats’ bleak prospects 
in the short term, long-term 
trends should give them reason to retain some holiday cheer as Nov. 4 approaches.
First of all, a Republican 
Senate takeover is far from deﬁ  nite. Assuming, as most observers do, that Republicans pick off Democratic seats in 
West Virginia, Montana and 
South Dakota, they would still have to win three out of the six races in Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Iowa, Louisiana and North Carolina, all of which are 
toss-ups. In addition, Republi-
cans would have to hold onto seats in Georgia, Kentucky and Kansas, where Democrats see a chance of making gains in the Senate. And thanks to get-out-the-vote efforts funded by their newfound success with large donors, Democrats have a le-
gitimate chance of winning in 
these swing states.
Furthermore, in this year’s 
gubernatorial races, where it’s harder for Republicans to na-tionalize the election and tie their opponents to an unpopu-lar president, they look even weaker. Many Republican in-
cumbents who were elected 
in the Tea Party wave of 2010 face more uphill battles against strong Democratic opponents in states that are slightly more liberal as a whole than those in contention for the Senate. Twenty-two out of the 36 gu-bernatorial races this year are in states that Obama won in 2012. And even in those states that Obama lost, Democratic 
or independent candidates are 
ahead of or tied with unpopu-lar Republican incumbents.
Indeed, the fact that red 
states like Georgia and Ken-tucky are in play at all is indica-tive of the Republicans’ poten-tial weaknesses on a larger scale going forward. As Washington 
Post columnist E.J. Dionne Jr. 
put it in a recent column, “Giv-en Obama’s low approval rat-ings, Republicans could have been running away with this thing. They’re not, because they look more extreme and out of touch than they did four years 
ago.”
National demographic 
trends are pushing the coun-
try in the opposite direction that gerrymandering and Tea Party primary challengers have pushed Republicans. Although these Republicans have short-term incentives to reject im-
migration reform and action 
on climate change to motivate their base in swing states that are whiter and more conserva-tive than the country as a whole, this will come back to bite them in 2016 and beyond.
Even in this election cycle, 
Democrats have been successful 
at putting climate change, if not 
immigration reform, back at the forefront of the national debate. According to a recent New York Times article, among this year’s Senate races, “energy and the environment are the third-most mentioned issue in political advertisements, behind health 
care and jobs.” A large part of 
this is the work of billionaire ac-tivist Tom Steyer, who is spend-ing $100 million on this election cycle to elect candidates that ac-knowledge that climate change 
is a real threat that requires a 
swift response. This has forced Republicans like Rick Scott, who is ﬁ  ghting for reelection as governor of Florida, where the disastrous effects of climate change can already be seen, to retreat from positions of all-out climate-change denial to simply 
saying, “I’m not a scientist.”
Given the demographic chal-
lenges that Republicans face, 
it would seem that the Demo-crats’ best strategy in the short term would be to embrace the president’s progressive stance on issues like the environment and immigration reform. In-
stead, Democrats across the 
board seem to be running as fast as they can away from President Obama (for example, in Sen. Mark Udall’s, D-Colo., insistence of the White House that “the last person they want to see coming is me.”) While this hostility towards the presi-dent is understandable given his low approval ratings, the young, diverse coalition that 
twice gave him more than 51 
percent of the national popular vote is only going to get big-ger as a percentage of the total population. This is where Dem-ocrats have an advantage, one that dwarfs any short-term ad-vantage that Republicans have for the midterms.

UF students have a chance to 
meet successful authors and poets at 
an MFA@FLA event starting Thurs-day.
MFA@FLA, the creative writing 
graduate program at UF, will host the 65th annual Florida Writers Fes-
tival from Thursday to Saturday.
“Because we’re learning to be 
creative writers and poets, it’s great 
to have the opportunity to hear suc-cessful writers speak about their work,” said Ryan Smith, assistant to the directors of the program and pri-
mary coordinator of the event.
Writers at the event include Pu-
litzer Prize-winning poet Charles 
Simic and UF alumnus and author Kevin Canty.
Canty graduated from UF with a master’s degree in English and has written four novels and three collec-tions of short stories, Smith said.
The festival will also host Myla 
Goldberg, Michael Dickman and Rivka Galchen. All the presenters range from up-and-coming writers to well-established writers.
Goldberg will kick off the festival 
with a reading at 7 p.m. Thursday at the Alachua County Library District Headquarters downtown.
Dickman and Galchen will host 
their readings Friday night while Canty and Simic will speak Satur-day night, all at UF’s Ustler Hall Atrium.
On Saturday afternoon, the ﬁ  ve 
authors will participate in craft talks designed to give audience members a behind-the-scenes look at their 
writing process, Smith said.“It’s a candid look into a writer’s 
process, rather than having them just 
share the work itself,” Smith said.
MFA@FLA also received help 
from the Alachua County Library for the event.
Lisa Finch, librarian supervisor of 
adult services at Alachua County Li-brary Headquarters, said the library has put up posters and handed out ﬂ  iers to advertise the event.
Writers for the festival were 
chosen based on recommendations from students and faculty in the cre-ative writing program.
Smith said they compile a list and 
send out invitations from that list.
“It’s great that we have a rela-
tionship with the library and can co-ordinate with them in order to reach the larger Gainesville community,” 
Smith said. UF grad featured at writers festival
� SHE DIED SATURDAY.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
PORTLAND, Ore. — With 
no states voting on right-to-die 
laws today, the weekend death of Brittany Maynard won’t have an immediate political impact.
But advocates for expanding 
such laws beyond a handful of states expect momentum from the young woman’s story to carry into the new year, when state legislatures go into ses-sion.
That optimism, however, 
will be met with the political 
reality that such legislation has 
been pushed for years, often unsuccessfully.
“Suicide is never a good 
solution, regardless of the situ-ation that one is confronting,” said Judie Brown, president of the American Life League, a Catholic group.
Maynard, terminally ill with 
brain cancer, was in the nation-al spotlight for about a month 
after publicizing that she and 
her husband, Dan Diaz, moved to Portland from Northern California so that she could use the Oregon law to end her life on her own terms. Maynard 
told journalists she planned to 
die Saturday, and  she followed through on that day. She was 29.
She approached the ad-
vocacy group Compassion & Choices during the summer in hopes that telling her story would lead to political action 
in California and across the 
nation. Whether that happens is an open question. Maynard, however, succeeded in raising 
awareness about an issue that 
was trending on Facebook and Twitter after her death.
“Younger people support 
death with dignity at really high levels, but it’s not neces-sarily relevant or salient to their lives,” said Pam Sandeen, executive director of the Death 
with Dignity National Center. 
“I think the Brittany Maynard story makes it real. It makes it something that could happen to them. It makes it an impor-tant issue to address.”
Last year, Vermont became 
the ﬁ  rst state to legalize aid in dying through legislation — 
Oregon and Washington did 
so by referendum; in Montana and New Mexico more recent-ly, it was effectively legalized through court decisions.
In New Jersey, the state as-
sembly considered but failed to pass an aid-in-dying bill in June. Democratic assemblyman 
John Burzichelli, who authored 
the bill, said he is hopeful it can pass the state’s lower chamber before the end of the year.
If that happens, he expects 
the Senate to pass it soon after, he said.
“It’s very clear to me that 
the majority voice in New Jer-
sey want another choice,” Bur-
zichelli said.
Compassion & Choice is 
spending about $7 million a year to protect the practice in states where it has been autho-rized and passing legislation in states where it has not, said Mickey MacIntyre, the group’s 
chief program ofﬁ  cer.Brittany Maynard

Gainesville residents will soon 
be able to experience a new side 
of Paynes Prairie Preserve State Park.
Parts of the park that are nor-
mally closed will be opened for the Paynes Prairie 5K on Nov. 22. Richard Dreher, the director of Project Gainesville — one of the organizations hosting the event — said this race is different because it’s part trail, part pavement. Run-ners could pass alligators, horses 
and rare birds.
“It’s a beautiful setting,” Dreher 
said. “It’s a really unique trail, and 
it’s for a great cause.”
This year’s race will benefit his 
organization and the Friends of Paynes Prairie. Dreher, 35, said about 200 to 300 runners partici-pate each year.Caroline Nickerson, a 20-year-
old UF history sophomore, ran the Paynes Prairie 5K last year and plans on doing it again.
“I recommend doing this 5K as 
opposed to other ones because this 5K is a true nature experience,” Nickerson said. “You’re immersed in nature, but you’re running on comfortable, familiar terrain.”
This year’s trail is a loop, accord-
ing to the 5K website. Runners can expect to traverse on grass, sand, dirt, pavement and underbrush.
Registration is now open. Pre-
registration is $30, which includes the price of a T-shirt. Participants can register without the shirt for $25 or at the park the day of the race for $35.Registration for participants 12 
years old and under is $15.
Melia Jacquot, a 23-year-old 
Book Gallery West employee and recent UF graduate, said she walked the first time she partici-pated in the race but plans on run-ning this year.
“Paynes Prairie is absolutely 
gorgeous in the morning,” Jacquot said. “You’re actually not dying while you’re running.”

The Alachua County Fire Department 
added an updated rescue truck to its fleet 
this week.
In order to operate the new truck, para-
medics had to complete a certification from UF which requires an additional 120 train-ing hours, and assistant fire chief Harold Theus said some paramedics have spent the last two years completing the certifica-tion in preparation for the new vehicle.
The vehicle has ventilators, IV pumps 
and new medications that paramedics do not typically carry on advanced life sup-port rescue units, Theus said. That’s one of the main benefits of the new truck: in-creasing the level of care for each patient its team transports.
Theus said patients are transported 
from smaller, local hospitals throughout the region to both UF Health Shands Hos-pital and North Florida Regional Medical Center for critical care and those patients need a way to safely travel back to their lo-cal hospitals when they are in more stable conditions.
Theus said the new vehicle will likely 
serve those patients, freeing up trucks to 
respond to dispatch calls within the coun-
ty’s jurisdiction.
“For our community, it leaves more 
units available to run emergency calls here as 911 — our primary responsibility,” Theus said.Fire dept. gets new truck 
� IT’S THE TALLEST BUILDING IN

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
NEW YORK — The silvery, 1,776-foot 
skyscraper that rose from the ashes of 9/11 
to become a symbol of American resilience opened for business Monday as 175 employ-ees of the magazine publishing giant Condé 
Nast settled into the first day of work in their 
new offices.
One World Trade Center’s official open-
ing marked a symbolic return to some sense of normalcy for the site where the towers toppled more than 13 years ago.
“The New York City skyline is whole again,” said Patrick Foye, executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns both the building and the 16-acre World Trade Center site.
Steps away from the new tower are two 
memorial fountains built on the footprints of 
the decimated twin towers, reminders of the 
more than 2,700 people who died in the ter-rorist attack.
Condé Nast, publisher of Vogue, The New 
Yorker and Vanity Fair, is expected to move in 3,000 more employees by early next year, eventually occupying 25 floors of the $3.9 bil-lion, 104-story tallest building in the U.S..
Amid Monday’s celebratory tour of parts 
of One World Trade Center, Condé Nast of-ficials declined to comment on employees’ possible fears about working in the building.World Trade Center reopens

UF volleyball’s Pole, Holston honored 
Florida’s Holly Pole was named the SEC Defensive Player 
of the Week on Monday, while Alex Holston was tabbed a Capital One Impact Performance of the Week.◗ VANDERBILT HASN’T WON 
AN SEC GAME YET.
MORGAN MORIARTY
Alligator Staff Writer @Morgan_Moriarty
Florida, just days after upset-
ting No. 11 Georgia and snapping 
a three-game-losing skid in the series, is wasting no time getting ready for its next opponent, Van-
derbilt.
“We need to bury the game and 
move on,” Florida coach Will Mus-
champ said Monday. 
The Commodores, under first-
year head coach Derek Mason, haven’t looked good this season, getting just three wins so far with all three of those victories being 
over non-Southeastern Conference 
opponents. 
Mason was hired from Stanford 
University, where he coordinated some of the most talented and ruthless defenses in his tenor in Palo Alto, California. 
Under Mason, the Cardinal 
ranked in the top 15 in defensive 
efficiency for three straight sea-
sons. In 2012, Mason was also a Broyles Award finalist, which is given to the top assistant in the country. 
“Derek Mason was, of course, 
the defensive coordinator at Stan-ford and probably fielded some of the better defenses in college foot-
ball the last three or four years,” 
Muschamp said. “He’s a really good football coach, extremely in-telligent.”
Although Mason’s defenses in 
years past have been dominant, Vanderbilt is currently 99th in scor-ing defense and is at the bottom of the SEC in pass efficiency defense. 
The Commodores switched from a 
4-3 to a 3-4 scheme in the offsea-son.
“They’re a little young on de-
fense but they do give you some issues mixing from odd and even fronts,” Muschamp said. “So we’ve 
gotta be able to identify the move 
around guys for them.” 
The Gators are coming off of a 418 rushing yard performance — a number that was the most rushing 
in an SEC game for Florida since 
the 1975 season. Vanderbilt is cur-

Max Garcia is a rock. It’s 
his job to be one.
A steady anchor cemented 
in the mud-caked turf hit af-
ter hit, yard after yard, game after game.
Lather, rinse, repeat.
Still, there he stands like a 
stone wall.
On Monday afternoon, 
the wall came down. 
In its place stood a man, 
exposed and impassioned. 
Poignant and sentimental. Human and real.
The 6-foot-4, 310-pound 
Max Garcia cried. 
Under the lights, in front 
of the cameras, he let the people know that he loves his brother.
“I get emotional talking 
about him just cause,” Garcia starts but can’t finish.
His head starts to bob as 
he takes a moment for a deep breath.
“He’s a hard worker, 
man.”
No description may be 
more fitting when talking about Michael McNeely.
Fewer than 24 hours after 
turning the tide of the Geor-
gia matchup with a 21-yard 
touchdown run on a fake field goal, McNeely exchanged his 
helmet and pads for a Publix 
apron and nametag.
And in a few years, he 
might hang all of that up for a white coat. 
McNeely was just ac-

Postseason. The word alone gets sports 
fans excited.
The postseason is do or die, win or go 
home, and it’s where the best of the best 
fight it out for the ultimate prize.
Florida will get its first taste of postsea-
son action this week when the No. 8 Gators 
travel to Orange Beach, Alabama, for the 
Southeastern Conference tournament.
Florida is the No. 2 seed in the conference behind Texas A&M and will play its first tournament game on Wednesday against 
No. 10 seed Tennessee, which defeated No. 
7 seed Alabama 3-2 on Monday.
For the Gators, they are just focusing on 
themselves and on how they can continue to improve, even at this point in the sea-
son.
“I think for us, we want to play the teams 
that are gonna challenge us the most,” 
coach Becky Burleigh said. “Anything that 
we can do to continue to prepare ourselves to head into the NCAA 
tournament as well is a 
good thing.”
To continue its winning 
ways throughout the SEC 
tournament and into the 
NCAA tournament, Flor-
ida will need to continue 
to suffocate teams with 
its balanced attack — a balanced attack that was recognized last weekend when five 
Gators were named to All-SEC teams.Sophomore Savannah Jordan, junior 
Christen Westphal and seniors Havana So-laun and Tessa Andujar were named to the 
All-SEC first team. Junior Claire Falknor was named to the All-SEC second team.
The players were proud to receive the 
honor, but they were also quick to give 
credit where credit is due.
“It’s nice to get recognition, but other 
than that I focus more on results and the 
team aspects and I feel like a lot of people UF finishes strong in conference, prepares for postseasonSee footbAll, p Age 15

It takes a village to block for a 
running back, or a wide receiver, 
or even a walk-on taking place of a holder. 
No matter the ball-carrier, Flor-
ida had solid blocking all around in its 38-20 victory over Georgia, especially from wide receiver De-marcus Robinson, who on one of  Matt Jones’ touchdown runs could be seen blocking not one, but two 
Georgia defenders, escorting Jones 
to pay-dirt. 
“Man, I loved it. It fired me up 
just seeing him throw two blocks on one play on that touchdown, with Matt Jones running down the left sideline,” said center Max Garcia. “That was incredible. I’ve never seen wide receivers block 
like that before. It just shows that 
we have unselfish players on this team. I don’t even know if he had a reception in this game, but he still was out there and he was a play-maker.”
While Robinson and other re-
ceivers may not have come to Florida to block, they didn’t have 
a choice on the day in which the 
team threw for the second fewest amount of attempts in school his-tory. Florida’s six passes thrown was 
also the fewest by any FBS team that played on Saturday.
“That’s what it comes down,” 
Garcia said. “Guys being unselfish about being on this football team 
and sacrificing your body for the 
guy next to you. That’s what it’s going to come down to is guys will-ing to lay it out on the line for each other.”
It wasn’t only for their team-
mates, but also for their coach that they laid everything out on the line for. Garcia and linebacker 
Mike Taylor met with the media 
last week and said they had their coaches back through whatever, and on Saturday at EverBank field they walked the walk after talking the talk.
Injury update: Offensive line-
man Trenton Brown has a bone bruise on his right knee per coach 
Will Muschamp and is “definitely” 
out this week against Vanderbilt. Brown’s status will be updated next Monday. Safety Keanu Neal has a high ankle injury and is also out this week. Defensive lineman Gerald Willis has a high ankle inju-ry as well and did not make the trip to Jacksonville but is questionable 
for Saturday’s game in Nashville.
East still winnable: Despite a 
subpar season, there is still a sce-nario in which Florida can win the 
SEC East and go to Atlanta for the 
SEC championship game. If Mis-
souri loses to Tennessee as well as any one of its remaining three conference opponents and Geor-gia loses to either Auburn or Ken-tucky, Florida would win a three-
way tiebreaker for the SEC East. 
But Muschamp isn’t interested in contingencies.
“No. At the end of the day we need to win,” Muschamp said. “And that’s laser focus on Florida 
and Vanderbilt for our football 
team. No scenario matters un-less we win, and it starts at 7:30 in Nashville.”

J.C. Deacon’s first fall season as the coach 
of the Florida men’s golf team started off on 
the wrong foot. But with their backs against the wall, the Gators showed resilience and was able to grow as the year went along.  
Deacon saw his team go from “mediocre” 
during their first tournament of the season, to being much improved, finishing in second place twice during the fall.
During the first round of the Carpet Capi-
tal Collegiate Classic, the team completed at 24-over-par, which was a staggering 31 shots behind the first place team in the field.
The horrendous start to the first tourna-
ment of the season served as a learning expe-rience for the team and a wakeup call.  
“That first round we had where we were 
so far behind the whole field and it was really a disaster, was the best thing that could ever happen to us,” Deacon said. 
“It woke everyone up, it 
woke me up, and it’s kind of hard to sleep in and be lazy 
and skip stuff when you’re 
that bad as we were.”
After their 13th-place finish in their first 
tournament, the Gators got back to work im-
mediately to improve their games. The team made strides in the following tournament as they collected a second place finish at the Wolf Run Intercollegiate.Deacon said the squad changed their ap-
proach and mindset preparing for competi-
tive play.
“All of us worked really hard, pushed 
things, looked at things in different ways, 
started practicing differently and we made a huge jump,” Deacon said.
Players like freshman Ryan Celano 
stepped up for the Gators and made an im-mediate impact. Senior J.D. Tomlinson was able to continue his run of success as a mem-
ber of the team. Deacon said everyone on the 
team contributed throughout the fall in some way.
With the improvement of the team, comes 
improvement from the coach. Deacon has had the opportunity to talk to a lot of success-ful coaches at the University of Florida and pick their brains.  “I’ve learned so much, it’s amazing when 
your word means so much and it is a great 
responsibility,” Deacon said. 
“I’ve really learned a lot from being around 
these other coaches, Becky and the women’s 
soccer team, I’ve learned a lot from her. Billy Donovan has had some great advice, just so many great people around here that are avail-able to me now and I’m trying to take advan-tage of that.”
With three months off until the team goes 
back into competition at the Sea Best Invita-tional in February, Deacon said he wants to keep motivating the guys and matching their effort.  
“Just staying on the guys…just trying to 
match their work ethic and as long as I bring it every day I know they are going to bring it with me,” he said.

With Week 9 of the 2014-2015 NFL sea-
son behind us, we take a look at former 
Gators contributing and/or slacking on teams across the country.
Former Gators wide receiver Percy Har-
vin continues to adjust and settle in to his 
new team, the New York Jets. Harvin was 
traded by the Seattle Seahawks on Oct. 18 
for a 2015 fourth or sixth round draft pick. 
During his second game with the Jets, 
Harvin hauled in a team-high 11 recep-tions for 129 yards. He rushed once for 
eight yards and returned two kicks for 88 
yards. But that wasn’t enough to secure a 
win for the Jets, as the Kansas City Chiefs 
defeated New York 24-10 on Sunday in 
Missouri.“Just keep fighting. Just go back to 
work,” Harvin said. “We’ll see what we did wrong, make the corrections and get 
back to work on Wednesday when we 
come back. I’ve been in this position before 
and all you can do is keep fighting. Play 
for your pride, play for your team, and just keep pushing forward.”
Harvin and his new team have a ways 
to go. Seattle is currently ranked No. 10 by 
ESPN, while the Jets are No. 30.
On the opposite side of the field, for-
mer Florida defensive tackle Jaye Howard 
notched two tackles for the Chiefs.
Uncharted territory: the Miami Dol-
phins completed their first shutout since December 2006 on Sunday. Miami defeated 
the San Diego Chargers 37-0 in Miami Gar-
dens. The Dolphins improved to a 5-3 re-cord with the help of three former Gators. 
Linebacker Jelani Jenkins contributed three 
tackles for the defense. Kicker Caleb Stur-gis made 3-of-4 field goal attempts, includ-
ing a long four 52 yards. The former Gator 
made all four extra-point attempts. Mike 
Pouncey started the game at right guard.
Bucking the ball: The Cleveland 
Browns defeated the Tampa Bay Buc-
caneers 22-17 in Ohio. On the winning 
side, former Gators cornerback Joe Haden notched three tackles and three passes de-fended. Former Gators and current Bucca-
neers wide receiver Louis Murphy caught 
two passes for 13 yards and safety Major 
Wright made a team leading 13 stops and 
one tackle-for-loss. The Browns improved 
to a 5-3 record while the Buccaneers re-main at 1-7.
Losing their way: the Jacksonville Jag-
uars are also familiar with a poor stand-
ing. After losing to the Cincinnati Bengals 
33-23 on Sunday, the Jaguars are 1-8 on the 
season. Former Gator and current Jaguars 
defensive back Josh Evans recorded six 
tackles for Jacksonville on Sunday. For the 
Bengals, former Gator and current Cincin-nati defensive end Carlos Dunlap recorded 
four tackles, one sack and three quarter-
back hits.  Week 9: Harvin had 11 receptions, Wright makes 13 stopsUF Golf

Play for your pride, play for your 
team, and just keep pushing

Percy Harvin
former Gators wide receiverBrown, Neal are injuredrently giving up 171 rushing 
yards per game. 
“I think we’ve blocked well 
up front, but we had some nice running lanes in what we 
were trying to do,” Muschamp 
said. “I think it was a good plan by our offensive staff, to go into the ballgame.” 
Offensively for the Com-
modores, the run game fea-tures true freshman running back Ralph Webb, who grad-uated from Gainesville High School. 
Webb is coming off of a 
record setting performance against Old Dominion last week, in which he ran for 166 yards — a school single-game record. Webb is also only 38 yards shy of the team’s fresh-man rushing record of 798 
yards — the number posted 
by Kwane Doster in 2002. 
Webb’s 760 yards leads all 
SEC freshman. 
Redshirt freshman Johnny 
McCrary had a five-touch-down performance against Old Dominion, a number that matches former Commodore quarterbacks like Jay Cutler and Bill Wade. The last SEC 
freshman to toss five touch-down passes was Missouri’s 
Maty Mauk, who did so 
against Kentucky last season. 
Last Saturday was only Mc-Crary’s second start of 2014. 
Vanderbilt beat Florida 
34-17 in The Swamp last sea-son, which was Homecoming weekend in Gainesville. That marked the Commodores’ first victory over the Gators 
since 1945. 
Redshirt senior center Max 
Garcia remembers how that 
loss felt and thinks the team will use that as motivation this weekend in Nashville. 
“We’re going to go to their 
house and we want them to experience the same disap-
pointment they gave to us last 
year,” Garcia said. “We have to redeem ourselves in that way.”
Although the Gators are 
coming off of an upset over their most hated SEC rival Georgia, there is no worry about complacency heading 
into Saturday night’s game 
for Muschamp and the rest of the staff.
“We don’t have anything 
to be overconfident about,” Muschamp said. “I think that one of the things you talk to your players about is how you respond after a loss and how 
do you respond after a win.”Vandy RB Webb is a 
former GHS athlete don’t get enough credit for what 
they do, for the little things they do,” Falknor said. “I couldn’t get 
this without the team.”
The first and second team hon-
ors come at a time when Florida 
is focused and preparing for the 
SEC tournament. That is where its attention is.
“I think we’re just really excited 
to play,” Andujar said. “We love going to the SEC tournament, it’s 
fun, different environment, teams bring it all and we try to bring it all too.”
The Gators are very much 
looking forward to their first tour-nament game on Wednesday and to getting their first taste of the 2014 postseason. For them, it’s hopefully only the beginning of an exhilarating few weeks of tour-
nament play.
“It’s exciting for us to have 
more games to play,” Burleigh 
said. “This team has always want-
ed to spend as much time as pos-
sible together, so I think they’re just looking forward to getting back on the field.”TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 4, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15

Savannah Jordan chases after the ball during Florida’s 6-1 win against Tennessee on Thursday at 
James G. Pressly Stadium. Jordan was named to the All-SEC First Team on Sunday.
Garcia visited McNeely at Publix on Sunday and took a selfie 
McNeely serves as the antithesis of the 
team’s “woe is me” attitude of 2013. 
After he broke his foot in 2012, the wide re-
ceiver played in all 12 games. All on special 
teams.
The same player who set a Palm Harbor 
University High record in receptions and 
yards during a single season was relegated to 
perform Florida’s most thankless jobs on the field.
He could have starred at Harvard or Dart-
mouth, two schools he flirted with during 
high school.
But McNeely’s efforts have not gone unno-
ticed with the Gators. 
The entire team mobbed him when he 
earned a scholarship during fall camp earlier 
this season and he was mobbed again when that decision finally paid off with a touch-down on Saturday.
“I think if we had a whole team full of 
McNeelys, we’d be a national championship team just because of the way he plays,” Garcia said. 
“Everything he does on and off the field is 
championship level.”
Garcia paid his 5-foot-8, 176-pound brother 
a visit at Publix on Sunday. 
He wanted to say hi and snag a selfie with 
Florida’s most popular cashier.
Why? It’s pretty simple.“McNeely’s my boy.”SidebAr , from page 13

Coming into the season, Rhamat Alhassan 
was a big question mark for Florida volley-
ball.
Her age and inexperience in the sport 
made her height her only real threat to people that hadn’t seen her play.
Then she played her ﬁ  rst match and the 
college volleyball world knew Florida had 
a new weapon — one that could potentially 
make up for the loss of former Gator Chloe Mann.
Alhassan ﬁ  nished Florida’s season opener 
against Georgia Southern with six kills on eight attempts and ﬁ  ve total blocks — an 
outstanding performance for a freshman that 
only had two years experience on the court, but two and a half months into the season and those stats would be a modest night for Alhassan, who now averages 2.75 kills per set.
“She has the combination … the athletic 
talent, the ability to learn and the drive, it’s the combination of those three that makes 
Rhamat the player she is today and the player 
she is in the future,” coach Mary Wise said.
The 6-foot-4 freshman has gone above and 
beyond what many Florida fans expected of her.
So far, she boasts ﬁ  ve player of the week 
honors and is second in the NCAA with a .466 hitting percentage.
In her time with the team, Alhassan has 
had to learn the ins-and-outs of college vol-leyball. One way she’s learned it is from the help of her teammates. Junior Simone Antwi, who played alongside Chloe Mann, has aid-ed Alhassan in her adjustment to collegiate play.
“I’ve embraced the role of helping her out 
because if I check out and she doesn’t know what she’s doing then it’s a thing… She’s helped me more than she knows,” Antwi said on Oct. 8.
Growth is imminent.
Alhassan was bound to grow when she 
entered that volleyball training arena at the 
Gale Lemerand Center in the middle of July, but it’s leaps and bounds ahead of what most coaching staff expect of freshmen.
In Alhassan’s ﬁ  rst appearance with the team at Florida’s season-opening media day, she was timid and giggled before answering questions. She was shy and uncomfortable and not at all sure of how to respond to inter-viewers questions.
Today, she interviews the way she plays. 
She’s strong and dominant and, while she still giggles, she’s conﬁ  dent, and who could blame her?
For the ﬁ  rst time in conference play, Al-hassan will be faced with blocking one of the best offensive teams in the Southeastern Con-ference. Her growth in blocking will be key for Florida to shut down an Alabama offense that has second and third-ranked outside and opposite side hitters.
“This is going to be a really, good fun 
match against Alabama and we’re glad we have all week to prepare for them,” Wise 
said.
