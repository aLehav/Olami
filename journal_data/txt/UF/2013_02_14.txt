Fierce replies and a lively mod-
erator sum up the UF 2013 Student 
Government Debate on Wednes-day.
The auditorium became a battle-
ground between the Students Party and its outside perspectives ver -
sus the in-house experience of the Swamp Party . Candidates answered and rebutted issues like tuition, cam-pus safety, SG transparency, election reform, budget and diversity.
Students Party presidential can-
didate Johnny Castillo introduced himself first by telling the crowd about his history of supporting the Unite Party. Unite Party was a dis-honest party , he said, that predated the Swamp Party and disillusioned students.
“It is in my belief that all Gators 
should be proud of their Student Government,” he said.
Castillo outlined his party’s plat-
form, which includes a merit-based SG and tuition increase opposition.
Swamp Party presidential candi-
date Christina Bonarrigo fired back with her resume, which includes her position as Senate President and four years as a Student Senator. She detailed the initiatives she helped pass in the Senate, including the Student Nighttime Auxiliary Patrol app, 24/5 library and water bottle refill stations.
“You’ve seen personal record 
versus no record,” she said. “That speaks volumes in itself.”
Vice presidential candidates Jen-
na Goldman of the Students Party and Joselyn Rivas of the Swamp Party spoke about the role of SG Cabinet. Goldman argued that some

After a Tuesday night traffic accident in 
southwest Gainesville sent two UF students 
to the hospital, city officials and local police are looking for a solution to reduce car-pe-destrian incidents in the area.
Deidre Messner and Zachary Lash were 
walking on a crosswalk near The District on 62nd apartment complex, 1000 SW 62nd Blvd., when they were hit by a van, Gainesville Police spokesman Officer Ben Tobias said.
Messner, an 18-year-old UF art freshman, 
said she and Lash, a 21-year-old UF history senior and a Student Senator, got off a bus and were crossing the road to Lash’s apart-ment.
As they walked across, Andrew Virgil, 
28, who was driving toward Southwest 20th Avenue, hit the couple with his van.
Messner said Lash tried to pull her out of the way, but she ended up taking most of the impact.
She remembers waking up in the middle 
of the road.
“I had no idea what was happening,” she 
said. “The whole day felt like a dream.”After police and paramedics arrived at 
the scene, an ambulance rushed the students to Shands at UF.
Messner and Lash are the fourth and fifth 
pedestrians struck by cars in that area since Jan. 1, 2012, Tobias said.
In an area notorious for vehicle-pedestri-
an accidents, Tuesday night’s incident has some city officials calling for action.

Christie Kosal was wait-
ing near the Music Building 
three years ago when some-one approached her and asked if she wanted to be serenaded.
Almost instantly, the 
22-year-old UF music edu-cation junior said she was pushed into a chair, and a group of men began to ser -
enade her.
Phi Mu Alpha, UF’s music 
fraternity, is taking orders for personal serenades until Saturday. A portion of the profits from the serenades will benefit Relay for Life.
A serenade costs $35 for a 
UF student and includes one song from the fraternity’s list and the “Sweetheart” song. A rose can also be presented for $3. Serenades are $40 to-day. 
Orders can be made on 
the fraternity’s website, www.ufphimualpha.com/serenades using PayPal or with cash.For non-UF students, a 
serenade is $45 today and $40 other days.
“It’s one of the sweetest 
things you can have, espe-cially on Valentine’s Day,” Kosal said.
Groups of 20 fraternity 
members serenade people on and off campus.
Phi Mu Alpha’s music di-
rector, Ismael Sandoval, said the serenades have been a UF tradition for more than eight years.
“It gives them a special 
moment they wouldn’t get with just flowers and candy,” the 19-year-old UF music ed-ucation sophomore said.
Kelvin Medina, the frater -
nity’s spokesman, said the “Sweetheart” song was com-posed by a fraternity brother for his girlfriend more than 50 years ago. 
He said most girls can’t 
help but shed a few tears during the song.
“You see that glimmer in 
their eye like we just made their day,” the 20-year-old UF marketing sophomore said.

One year ago, Donna Rud-
nicki used to drive everywhere. 
But after Rudnicki learned more about the effects of pollution on the environment, she decided to switch from four wheels to two.
The 21-year-old UF English ju-
nior now commutes via bicycle.
Rudnicki will be among the 
hundreds of students who will participate in the UF Office of Sustainability’s Under One Um-brella campaign, which starts today.
“UF, overall, has a goal of be-
ing carbon neutral by 2025 and to produce zero waste by 2016,” said Michael Amish, a program assistant in the UF Office of Sus-tainability.
This campaign focuses on sus-
tainability-related activities on campus and in the community to encourage students, faculty and Gainesville residents to learn how the various components of sustainability interact, according the office’s website.
Amish said the office is excited 
to use this campaign to reach out to partners across campus and connect with students about the importance of creating a sustain-able university.
The initiative features five 
components of ideal sustainabil-ity — food, water, service, waste and energy — while focusing on how their interdependence is necessary to achieve a sustain-able way of life on campus.
Carla Etheridge, intern for the 
Office of Sustainability, said it is an open campaign.
“People can submit their ideas 
for events throughout the dura-tion of the campaign,” she said.
Under One Umbrella launched 
this morning with the Farm to Table, Bike to Breakfast event  at Gator Corner Dining Center.
Other events throughout the 
campaign include a screening of “The Clean Bin Project” in part-nership with the Florida Museum of Natural History. There will also be a Campus Earth Day celebra-tion during which UF President Bernie Machen will give his State of Sustainability address and the presentation of the Champions for Change Awards.
The campaign ends April 24 
with a campuswide collection day for household hazardous waste and other items.

TONIGHT.

In the spirit of Valentine’s 
Day, there will be a Digging 
the Love fundraiser tonight to benefit UF Baby Gator Child Development Centers.
The fundraiser, hosted by 
Chris Machen and Danette Good, will be at the UF Presi-dent’s House from 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m. and will include food, drinks and auctions.
Tickets cost $50 a person 
and can be purchased online or at the door. Funds will help create natural playgrounds, which incorporate elements of nature.“We want to remove con-
crete and plastic and replace those with pieces that are made from natural elements,” said Pamela Pallas, director of Baby Gator Child Development and Research Centers at UF.
Some trees that have to be 
cut down on campus will be re-cycled to make benches, decks and playhouses, Pallas said.
Stacy Ellis Thomas, associ-
ate director for Baby Gator, wrote in an email that teachers and students will use the new playgrounds to explore nature and grow produce.
Pallas said she expects 
about 200 guests and hopes to raise $40,000. The goal is to begin construction in the next few weeks.

“UF, overall, has a goal 
of being carbon neutral by 
2025 and to produce zero 
waste by 2016.”
Michael Amish
program assistant in the UF Office 
of Sustainabilitylieves the issue needs to be addressed as 
soon as possible.
“When we start talking about lives 
at stake, you don’t sit around,” he said. “You do something now.”
On Wednesday, Chase wrote an 
email to City Manager Russ Blackburn outlining possible solutions to the prob-lem, which include adding a stationary police car to the intersection and lower-ing the speed limit.
Blackburn responded with a list of 
actions the city’s Public Works Depart-ment and Gainesville Police have al-ready taken to alleviate pedestrian ac-cidents in the area.
One of the items included Gainesville 
Police’s Pedestrian High Visibility En-forcement Program, which resulted in the department issuing 130 citations to motorists Jan. 25 and Jan. 28.
Blackburn also wrote that Public 
Works has installed signs on opposite sides of the crosswalk to warn drivers of pedestrians.
The intersection lies within City 
Commissioner Susan Bottcher’s district.Bottcher said she plans to work with the city to reduce the number of accidents on the crosswalk.
However, she said, she thinks the 
root of the problem should be deter-mined before any action is taken.
“We should really understand what’s 
causing accidents and decide from there what our best step forward is,” she said. “We need to make sure we go about it in a manner where it will actually remedy the problem.”

With an $18 million budget at 
stake, funding was hotly debated between the treasurer candidates. Students Party candidate Billy Far -
rell suggested cutting SG officials’ perks, which he said cost $3,000. Jayce Victor of the Swamp Party ar -
gued the perks were necessary.
Both parties discussed the “One 
More Block” initiative for SNAP and soft bar closings.
Goldman said SNAP employees were against the initiative. She said One More Block would exhaust the four vans that serve the existing area. Bonarrigo, who supported both ini-tiatives in the Senate, said these ideas will help the Student Body.

“Their ideas came through clear -

◗ THE ONLINE SURVEY CLOSES FRIDAY.
ELISE RODRIGUEZ
Alligator Contributing Writer
The City of Gainesville and the Regional Tran-
sit System are asking the public for its opinion as 
part of a study that focuses on implementing an alternative bus system.
The city and RTS have been asking students as 
well as residents for input to find the best alterna-tive to the current bus system, said Ginger Cor -
less, GO-Enhance RTS Study information officer.
The survey has been available online on the 
GO-Enhance RTS website, www.go-enhancerts.com, since Jan. 22 and will close Friday.
“More than anything, what we need right now 
is input,” Corless said.
The survey is part of the GO-Enhance RTS 
Study, which began in October, according to the study’s website.
RTS Chief Transit Planner Doug Robinson 
said the city has been a potential location for an alternate bus system for several years.
In 2010, the city oversaw what is known as the 
Rapid Transit Feasibility Study , which found a need for residents in east Gainesville to be con-nected to major employment and shopping areas, Robinson said.
The study showed that a Bus Rapid Transit 
system would offer the greatest improvements in mobility and reduce traffic congestion.
In the study, Robinson said, BRT is still under 
consideration and is asking for public comment.
“We identified a need for improved transit,” he 
said. “Now, the community needs to see what can be done to make moving around here better.”Robinson said BRT is modeled to resemble a 
rail transportation system.
The system would be designed to expand 
roads and designate specific lanes for the buses to increase travel speed and reliability.
In addition, the lack of stops and improved 
design of the BRT buses would make them envi-ronmentally friendly, Robinson said.
In previous RTS studies, residents tended to 
favor rail systems more than city buses.
“It has to do with nostalgia and the perma-
nence of rail systems,” he said. “Rail systems are just simpler. They run right or left, with no stops in between.”
The proposed system, however, has its down-
sides. Widening streets is expensive, and the con-struction would increase congestion for motorists, Robinson said.
The study area encompasses 16.6 miles from 
Santa Fe College to the Gainesville Regional Air -
port, according the GO-Enhance RTS Study web-site.
With the BRT’s potential to reduce traffic, stu-
dents won’t have to worry about being late to class.
Cristina Lopez-Poza, a 20-year-old SFC stu-
dent, said she would consider using BRT system buses if they make travel quicker.
“I think it’d probably be a very good idea and 
might offer a lot of Santa Fe students an easier way to get around,” she said.
Corless said the goal of the study is to have a 
streamlined plan for transportation approved by the city and the county by late spring.
The next step will be to apply for federal fund-
ing.
“I truly believe an enhanced bus system will 
help us long term,” she said.Survey takes input on bus systemReader response

Dog Show: 
Get out and vote, y’all
It’s the year of the underdog. Expect the unexpected.
“A tiny black affenpinscher named Banana Joe won the 
coveted Best in Show award at the 137th Westminster Ken-
nel Club Dog Show on Tuesday ,” according to the Los Angeles 
Times.
“The second ribbon went to Swagger, an Old English sheep-
dog who was named Reserve Best in Show, or runner-up to the winner,” according to the Times.
Somehow, a dog named Swagger only got second place in a 
reputable dog show competition. Only second place!
This opens so many doors and opportunities for people to 
advance in life. 
This isn’t at all an allegory to Student Government elections.“Swagger, a 20-month-old Old English sheepdog, stunned 
many observers, entering as a ‘class’ dog and defeating far more seasoned competitors to win the herding dog category Monday ,” according to the Times. “Swagger was a clear crowd favorite but came in second to Banana Joe in the final judging.”
Bring it on, Swagger. Bring it on, indeed.“They have a comical seriousness about them,” Ernesto Lara 
said, according to USA Today. “He doesn’t think he’s funny. He doesn’t know his size or know that he has a pushed-in face. He thinks he’s Mr. America.”
It’s the unassuming ones who enter contests without expect-
ing to win — those are the ones you have to watch out for. It’s the quiet ones who are too busy listening to you to make prob-lems who end up being the best.
Again, not at all referencing the upcoming elections.“It’s almost indescribable,” Lara said, according to the Times. 
He described the dog — a member of the toy group — as a “small breed with a big heart.”
What a sweet way to describe, like, anything. OK, OK. We’ll 
drop the facade. This is basically about the SG elections and how you should never assume what the outcome will be. You have the power. We’re not saying at this moment whom we necessar -
ily want to win or lose. Nope, not at all.
For right now, we’d just like to pose the hypothetical situa-
tion of Swagger versus Banana Joe. Think about it.
We have the collective power to change the outcome of any 
election, by the way — in case you needed a reminder.
“Backstage before the show, there were rows of tables with 
owners and trainers pampering pooches of all shapes, sizes, breeds and hairstyles,” according to an ABC News article. “Spaniels were combed, poodles were coiffed and Scottish deer -
hounds were brushed to show-level perfection.”
“I’m still in shock,” said Swagger’s owner, Colton Johnson of 
Colorado Springs, according to the Times. “This is a hard show for dogs that are seasoned, let alone dogs that have showed just four times.”
We agree. Any competition is pretty nerve-wracking. It’s im-
pressive to even put yourself out there to be judged. 
Just never assume the outcome. Keep your hopes up and 
your expectations low.Letters to the Editor
Students deserve more from Student Government  
Before I came to college, I pictured a place where the best 
ideas rose to the top, a place where students were progres-sive in their thoughts and actions and a place where, if you worked hard enough, you could be a leader. I didn’t find these things in UF’s Student Government. In fact, I found the exact opposite.
For decades, forces that represent the interests of a select 
few have had a stranglehold on power at this university.
They have promoted people they know instead of people 
who could do a better job. They have stifled debate about important issues out of fear of losing their positions. Perhaps most frighteningly , they have coerced thousands of students into voting for them through an elaborate system of rewards and punishments.
The party in power controls every aspect of SG on this 
campus, from Senate to the executive branch, from the elec-tion commission to agencies like Accent and Student Gov-ernment Productions. At times, it seems like the party in power is following the playbook of an authoritarian regime from another country. They are most certainly not finding their tactics in a textbook about democracy.
I believe the most qualified candidates should be chosen, 
and I believe every qualified candidate should have a fair shot at winning an election, regardless of what organizations he or she is a member of. I believe students should be allowed to express their opinions without fear of consequences or re-taliation, because I believe in the power of our First Amend-ment rights as Americans.
I believe all students should be able to vote for the people 
they want representing them without being coerced into vot-ing a certain way . Do you value democracy? Do you value freedom of speech? Do you value the rights of all students to be fairly represented in SG? If you do, then understand that the vote you cast is a vote in support or opposition of those ideals.
To me, SG elections present a very clear right and wrong. 
To me, it is clearly right to stand up for meritocracy , freedom of speech and free elections. To me, there is only one party you can count on to stand up for these rights: the Students Party.
Grier Ferguson 
Vice President, Students PartyAll students should be proud of SG efforts
On Monday, Students Party presidential candidate 
Johnny Castillo said the following: 
”Erasing the divide between the Greek community 
and other students at UF is crucial to making Student 
Government an institution we can be proud of.”
Mr. Castillo is entitled to his opinion, but as someone 
who has dedicated this school year to proving the opposite point, I beg to differ.
My agency — Action SG — consists of members 
of both parties and of those involved a multitude of student organizations — who are dedicated to extolling the values of SG. 
In addition, we’ve launched an SG Ambassador 
Program with an invite to every single student organization who’d like to know more about SG, and nearly every one of our initial organizations are not Greek organizations.
This past year alone, SG outreach has increased 
exponentially — from social media to town halls and barbecues. 
Just Monday morning students tabled  not for a party 
— but for SG. 
I’m proud of an SG that fought for Library West to 
stay open 24/5, SNAP to go mobile and tuition to not rise through Aim Higher. 
I’m proud of an SG that launched mobile deals 
for students, iPad rentals at Library West and saved students nearly $30,000 on Textbook Discount Day at the bookstore.
I encourage all students to find out what SG is doing 
for themselves.
You can follow @UF_SG and @UFActionSG on 
Twitter, or on Facebook at UF Student Government or Action SG. 
I’m proud to be in an SG all students should be proud 
of.

With Sundance Film Festival 
wrapping up late last month, 
cinema enthusiasts who prefer to stay local won’t have to trav-el far for a film festival experi-ence this weekend.
On Friday, the Florida Ex-
perimental Film/Video Festi-val, known as FLEX Fest, will open at the Top Secret Space, 22 North Main St..
FLEX Fest will show ex-
perimental films from 55 coun-tries during eight screenings throughout the weekend.
Roger Beebe, the founder 
and artistic director of the festi-val, said that FLEX Fest is one of the only experimental film festivals in the Southeast.
“This kind of filmmaking 
doesn’t get a lot of recognition,” said Beebe, also a UF professor of post-classical cinema and cameraless filmmaking.
Jodie Mack, an experimental 
animation professor at Dart-mouth College, helped start FLEX Fest when she was an un-dergraduate at UF. She also has a number of films in this year’s festival.
“Experimental film allows 
film to explore the medium outside of a commercial for -
mat,” she said. “It sum-mons other possibilities in cinema.”
A l i s s o n 
Bittiker, the m a n a g i n g director of 
FLEX Fest and a UF teaching lab assistant of creative photog-raphy , encourages any students who are interested in film and experimental film to attend and talk with some of the filmmak-ers who will be present after the screenings.
Tickets for the event cost $5 
a screening, and a festival pass costs $25 and includes access to all shows and after parties. Festival screens filmsBOBBY DESMOND

Mimicking the movements of One Di-
rection, The Wanted — a popular boy 
band in the United Kingdom — crossed the Atlantic in hopes of achieving success in America. And boy, are they glad they came.
In December, The Wanted’s debut sin-
gle “Glad You Came” was named the No. 1 song of 2012 by American Top 40 with Ryan Seacrest. 
Soon after, rumors began to circulate 
that the group was in communication with E! Network to appear on its own reality TV show.
That rumor was confirmed last week 
after the guys appeared on “Chasing the Saturdays,” a reality show that follows the lives of a UK girl band trying to make it big in America.However, the group’s 
new reality show, “The Wanted Life,” may have one thing “Chasing the Saturdays” does not: Lindsay Lohan.
The actress and Holly-
wood hot mess has been caught flying to numer -
ous cities on the band’s tour and is rumored to be dating band member Max George.Lohan also posted pictures on her Ins-
tagram that lead some to believe the two were an official couple.
George, who admitted to sharing a 
“snog” (the UK version of a kiss) with the actress,  tweeted she won’t be on the show because he thought “she might be in pris-on.”
Whether this was an honest joke or an 
attempt to cover up a secret relationship re-mains unknown. 
I guess we’ll just have to tune in to “The 
Wanted Life” on E! when the show pre-mieres in June to find out.

Magic — it’s what happens 
when audience suggestions 
combine with comedy gold on stage during the eigth annual Gainesville Improv Festival. 
The Festival will run for four 
days with shows at High Dive Wednesday and Thursday and performances at The Phillips Center for the Performing Arts Squitieri Studio Theatre Friday and Saturday. 
Twenty-four improvisational 
and sketch comedy troupes from around the country will perform.
Tom O’Donnell, producer of 
the Gainesville Improv Festival, said performing for the first time was like “Fight Club.” When you get on stage, you can’t think, you just have to do, he said.From that terrifying first time, 
improv became an obsession for the former Theatre Strike Force member who, along with Skyler Stone, founded the festival in 2005.
Improv is an unscripted form 
of comedy. Audience sugges-tions are taken for skits, creating unique material with each perfor -
mance, Stone said.
As a first time performer at 
the festival, Drew Korb, a former member of Theatre Strike Force and a current member of Chica-go’s Mission Improvable — “the secret agents of comedy,” as he calls the members — said it’s a dream and an honor to perform in Gainesville again.
“Improv … it makes you better, 
it makes you sharper and makes you learn more about what’s go-ing on in the world,” he said.

schedule and ticket information, visit www.gainesvilleimprov.com.

Dear Questionable Friend,
A gust of wind, perfect high-fives, 
finishing someone’s sentence, Bill 
Murray, ABC Family’s “25 Days of Christmas,” touch-sensitive lamps, CVS/pharmacy coupons, “Goose-bumps” (the novels by R.L. Stine), when adjusting your position in a chair unexpectedly sounds like a fart and when someone does an impression of Bill Cosby, Woody Allen or Christo-
pher Walken.Dear Mediocre Advice,
From what I’ve gathered from 
reading your column, we share a 
love for facial hair. Besides mus-taches, what turns you on?
Dear Friend,
It’s hard to drive a bulldozer through someone’s life, but you did it for 
the right reasons. To stay with someone you don’t want to be with is not 
fair to either of you. He would have put effort into a dead relationship, which would have delayed his progress in getting over you. Don’t beat yourself up. If you spend too much time with him, he could confuse your care for his well-being with actually wanting to be with him. Mixed signals will only make the breakup harder. Give him space and time. 
You did the right thing. Dear Mediocre Advice,
I broke up with my boyfriend of one year because I did not 
see things working out in the long run. He was 100 percent 
invested, and I was not. I’m devastated because I hurt a good, honest and loving person, and I can’t stop thinking about him. I didn’t know being the one to end a relationship could hurt like this. What do I do? Am I a shallow, terrible person for not giving it more time? How do I get through this?
Dear Friend,
The best advice my parents 
ever gave me was to buy a 
printer. At first I argued how little I would use it and how it would be a waste of money, but I use that thing all the time. When your parents offer to buy you a printer, accept their offer and take the damn thing.Dear Mediocre Advice,
What is the best advice 
your parents ever gave 
you?Valentine’s Day 
Table for Two
SEANTYEL HARDY
Avenue Contributing Writer
Unless you’re Taylor Swift, you’ve prob-
ably been single on Valentine’s Day. But it 
shouldn’t be a letdown this year.
“Safe Haven,” based on a novel by Nich-
olas Sparks, released in theaters today.
Although going to see anything based 
on a Sparks book when you’re single seems like suicide, going with your friends is a good idea. That is safer than seeing it with a guy who you’re going to compare to the on-screen hunk, only to be disappointed.
If you aren’t into love stories, you can de-
cide Valentine’s Day is “A Good Day to Die Hard,” and check out Bruce Willis on the big screen. If you see it matinee, you can avoid the couples and save a few dollars.
Another option is to take a trip to Gin-
nie Springs. If you haven’t been to Ginnie Springs, you will ﬁ  nd that the grounds of-fer camping, tubing, diving instructions and more, according to www.ginniespringsout-doors.com.
Tubing far away from malls, Hallmark 
stores and overpriced restaurants will help you pass the day away. You have to remem-ber, Valentine’s Day is not just about your signiﬁ  cant other, it is about anyone you love.
A visit to the Hippodrome State The-
atre, 25 SE Second Place, to see “The Vagina Monologues” can also help make your day . The play is sponsored by One Billion Rising and the Community of Gainesville’s VDAY 
campaigns, which aim to end violence 
against women.The play is based on Eve Ensler’s 
interviews with more than 200 wom-en, according to the Hippodrome’s web-site listing. Tickets are $25, which includes a $20 donation to Peaceful Paths, a local do-mestic abuse shelter. Following the show, there will be a silent auction which will also beneﬁ  t the cause.
If music is more your scene, the second 
annual Heartbreakers Ball will take place Downtown at High Dive beginning at 9 p.m. Performances include The Barstool Proph-ets, The Prenups and Chris McCarty, belting ballads that singles can relate to. Tickets will cost $8 at the door.
The biggest beneﬁ  t of attending a Heart-
breakers Ball is that there will be plenty of single ladies and men there to meet. You can also feel good about yourself because proceeds will go to the Nonproﬁ  t Center of North Central Florida, an organization that supports other nonproﬁ  ts in the commu-nity.
A last option is to grab your closest 
friends and hit up Midtown or downtown, whichever you prefer. You obviously can’t force love, but going out rarely turns into a bad night. There are sure to be drink specials everywhere, and while I’m not telling you to drink your sorrows away , I am telling you to make the most of your night.
Instead of throwing your own bitter bash 
this year, grab some friends, get out there and just do something. Unless you’re practi-cally [or actually] married, Valentine’s Day is just another day. Carpe diem, or seize the day. Put away the gallon of ice cream and see what Gainesville has to offer.Valentine’s Day 
À La Carte
JENNIFER HERNANDEZ
Avenue Contributing Writer
Relationships are difﬁ  cult. Usually, 
mates want you to hang out with them, 
do them special favors and make them sandwiches. With full schedules and thriving career goals, we just don’t have the time or energy to keep up with the de-mands of a relationship. But Valentine’s Day is different. It’s the day to put all of your stress aside and put out.
You and your signiﬁ  cant other are 
probably tired of the quiet dinners in and the uneventful dates out. If you’re look-ing for a fresh take on romance, mix it up this Valentine’s Day by partaking in ac-tivities that will add variety to your day and night.
Revisit your childhood memories 
with a trip to the Santa Fe College Teach-ing Zoo. College students don’t get to see exotic animals often, unless they’re ma-joring in zoology — or they go clubbing every night — so this could be a change of scenery. The zoo is open from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. and admission is $5.
Immerse yourselves in nature by visit-
ing the local parks. Activities like canoe-ing and row boating at Lake Wauburg can help you bond with whom you’re dating. If you get stranded in the middle of the lake, you have to work as a team.
Nature lovers can also take a walk, 
have a picnic and watch the sunset at Lake Alice. For the adrenaline-loving 
couple, biking, hiking or horseback riding at Paynes Prairie is the ad-venture for you.
Get creative and cook together. 
Publix sells prepared pizza dough, so purchase some sauce, cheese and a couple of toppings, and make your own gourmet meal for two for less than $20. Toss a salad, pop a bottle of wine and din-ner is served. If you are worried about all the pesky extra calories, don’t fret. You’ll be burning those off soon.
The fashionable couple will enjoy a 
fancy night out on the town. Throw on your best threads, splash on your favor-ite fragrance and grab your girl or guy for a spin around downtown. Do a little shopping, grab a bite at the local cupcake shop, Sarkara Sweets, or simply enjoy each others company. This can also work for the chic, penny-pinching twosome.
Find peace among the butterﬂ  ies at the 
Butterﬂ  y Rainforest exhibit at the Florida Museum of Natural History before 5 p.m. These colorful critters can illuminate an afternoon with a new love or an old ﬂ  ame as you catch up in an environment that is famous for its serenity. Admission is $9 if you present your Gator1 Card.
The Harn hosts Museum Nights, and 
tonight they will collaborate with the Center for African Studies to celebrate love, poetry, music, dance and food from Africa. The cultured crowd can enjoy this fun and free insight into another civili-zation’s practices of romance. Whatever you end up doing, make sure it’s a fun activity you both enjoy. Most impor-tant, remember to end the night with a bang.

Fashion may have been under 
close supervision at this year’s 
Grammy Awards, as per a memo about wardrobe guidelines issued by CBS, but the artists didn’t hold back when it came to performances. That’s what makes the Grammys so great — the pairings of some of the most legendary performers with to-day’s rising artists makes for mem-orable moments in music.
Taylor Swift kicked the night off in carnival garb with her hit  song “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together.” Her performance may have been cute with the campy set-ting, but her accent jab at ex-boy-friend Harry Styles was anything but subtle.
Other performance highlights 
include Fun. with a rain-drenched version of single “Carry On.” The band, which garnered an impres-sive six nominations for the night, took home trophies for Best New Artist and Song of the Year.
Rihanna took the stage twice, 
once to perform her slow power ballad “Stay” and again alongside Bruno Mars, Sting, Ziggy and Da-mian Marley to pay (a severely awesome) tribute to Bob Marley.
Also taking the stage twice was 
the always dap-per Justin Tim-berlake, who brought Jay-Z on stage for the television de-but of “Suit and Tie.” JT contin-ued his perfor-mance, com-plete with a big 
band and orchestra, with new song “Pusher Love Girl” from his up-coming album “The 20/20 Experi-ence.” His return to the Grammy stage marked a highlight of the night for many.
Top honors went to Gotye and 
Kimbra’s “Somebody That I Used to Know” for Record of the Year, and Mumford & Sons took home the trophy for Album of the Year. Other winners included The Black Keys for Best Rock Album, Zac Brown Band for Best Country Al-bum, and Adele for Best Pop Solo Performance.
The announcers were just as 
memorable as the performances themselves. As host LL Cool J put it, “Our introductions to perfor-mances can be performances.…” The Lumineers played its hit “Ho Hey” before Jack White took the stage, while Miguel and Wiz Khali-fa did a crooning/rapping ditty be-fore introducing the nominees for Best Country Solo Performance. 
Johnny Depp, in all of his glory, 
introduced Mumford, and the hilar-ious duo of Beyonce and Ellen De-Generes brought out Timberlake.
Between the surprises and the 
snubs (ahem: Frank Ocean), this year’s telecast had no shortage of excitement. 
Transitioning from music to 
movie awards, the Oscars are less than two weeks away. Tune in to ABC at 7 p.m. Feb. 24  for the year’s top honors in motion pictures.

Before you read this album review, I 
should explain something: I am a huge Matt 
Pond fan. I discovered Matt Pond about six years ago in my years between high school and college. 
This was before I lived in Gainesville, 
in my first apartment behind an interstate. I worked as a bartender serving heavy-handed Jack and Coke’s to depressed 40-somethings who mistook my desperation for their money as an interest in their sex lives. (Really , I couldn’t care less about how cheating on your wife validates your mas-culinity.)
In those shapeless years, I was young 
and terrified and convinced the rest of my life would be spent smiling at people I hated with every fiber in my body. And then I heard Pond’s 2005 song, “So Much Trouble,” and recognized this feeling was ubiquitous among directionless teenage bums. Pond became a band through which I sought refuge.
Pond’s talent as a songwriter lies in his 
ability to lull his listeners into a previous state. His music is ripe with reverie, and when it’s on, you can’t help but remember feelings of adolescent hunger, uncertainty and being alone, alone, alone, alone and alone. But my question is this: What hap-pens when you start to feel better?
The latest album is “The Lives Inside the 
Lines In Your Hand.”
The album’s opening is promising 
enough, with a deluge of “whoa-oh-whoa-oh’s,” and Pond’s unfailingly familiar elec-tric mellowness — you feel like you’re lis-tening to a dying tree sing you songs about the fall. And this, of course, is wonderful, until you realize you heard these songs last fall, and the fall before that, and so on.
For the long-term 
Pond fans, “Lives Inside the Lines,” feels more like compulsion than sincer -
ity . After fifteen years of writing music, Pond re-turns to what he’s used to: animated melancholy.
Although I still love 
the music, I think my disappointment stems from wanting to hear a warmer perspective from Pond, especially as the colder months dwindle to their trifling Floridian end.
Still, all is not lost. There are four songs 
worth putting on your iPhone or iPod for a walk around the neighborhood while the weather is still winter-ish. “Let Me Live,” “Love to Get Used,” “Go Where the Leaves Go” and the title song, “The Lives Inside the Lines in Your Hand,” still ring nostalgically of Pond’s ability to say something new in a bittersweet way.
While I’m not crazy about the new al-
bum, I’m still a fan of the band. If you’ve never listened to Pond, the four aforemen-tioned songs aren’t a bad place to start — or finish, depending on how you look at it.
‘The Lives Inside the Lines’: 
Matt Pond embraces sadness

Junior Karsten Whitson reacts after recording a strikeout during Florida’s 
9-8 win against NC State on June 10, 2012, at McKethan Stadium.
JOSH JURNOVOY
Alligator Staff Writer
Junior pitcher Karsten Whitson 
is out indefinitely due to shoul-
der fatigue, Florida announced on Wednesday.
Whitson, who was slated to be 
the team’s No. 2 starter behind Jona-thon Crawford, missed a month of the 2012 season because of fatigue in his right forearm.
“Karsten has been battling con-
tinued shoulder fatigue,” head athletic trainer  Pat Hassell said in 
a release. “We have pursued a con-servative management plan to treat this issue. Karsten is evaluating fur -
ther options at this time that will allow for a healthy and productive return to baseball.”
Coach Kevin O’Sullivan said 
Wednesday that there is no time-table for Whitson to return. Prior to being sidelined last season, Whit-son’s velocity topped out in the low-90s. During fall practice he was throwing in the mid-90s again, so arm trouble appeared to be behind him.
“He’s disappointed,” O’Sullivan 
said. “Anybody in his shoes would be a little disappointed. But we’re still staying optimistic.” 
O’Sullivan said he was not 
caught off-guard by Whitson’s dis-maying news. By the end of January, O’Sullivan knew Whitson might not be ready for this weekend’s opening series against Duke.
“There’s a lot of prep that goes 
into [getting ready for the season],” O’Sullivan said. “You got to do the throwing program — bullpens, throw to live hitters — and we haven’t been able to get through the full cycle.”
After being drafted ninth overall 
by the San Diego Padres in the 2010 MLB First-Year Player Draft, Whit-son turned down a $2.1 million con-tract to come to UF. He struck out 92 batters in 97.1 innings during a strong freshman season. 
Doctors did not find any struc-
tural damage when Whitson expe-rienced shoulder fatigue last season. However, Baseball America report-ed on Wednesday afternoon that Whitson was meeting with orthope-dic surgeon Dr. James Andrews. 
A world-renowned surgeon, An-
drews has performed Tommy John surgery on major league pitchers such as John Smoltz and Brian Wil-son, and shoulder surgery on NFL quarterbacks Brett Favre and Drew Brees. Andrews primarily works out of Birmingham, Ala., but also has a facility in Gulf Breeze, which is less than 2 hours from Whitson’s hometown of Chipley.
O’Sullivan said freshman right-
hander Tucker Simpson will start in Whitson’s place on Saturday . Sophomore Justin Shafer will start on Sunday.
“Karsten Whitson is an awesome 
pitcher,” sophomore catcher Tay-lor Gushue said. “But our younger guys are definitely going to have to step up this year. That’s how it’s go-ing to affect us. … I’m not worried about it. Karsten has a lot of talent, but our team is good enough to take it in stride, and we’ll just go from there.”

Junior sidelined with ‘shoulder fatigue’
PHILLIP HEILMAN
Alligator Staff Writer
The sound of Rod Stewart’s voice still 
makes coach Amanda Butler cringe. 
Stewart’s music evokes memories of 
a disappointing time in Butler’s life — 
the final game of her college career and the frustration that went with it. 
Butler played four seasons at Flori-
da from 1990-94. In her final year, the Gators received a No. 4 seed and were prepared to host the opening round of the NCAA Tournament.  
However, Stewart was scheduled to 
perform in the O’Connell Center that weekend, forcing UF to decline the op-tion to play at home. Instead, Florida traveled to College Station, Texas, to face Texas A&M.
Given the gift of homecourt advan-
tage, the Aggies upset the Gators 78-76, ending Butler’s college career. She scored 15 points in the loss and still harbors irritation about her final season being cut short. 
“It is a little bit a part of Gator histo-

The next chapter is tonight at 9. Flor -
ida travels to College Station to play No. 11 Texas A&M in the first meeting between the two teams since the 1994 matchup. 
“I would much rather think about 
this next experience in Reed Arena,” Butler said. “I think it’s going to be a much more pleasant one.”
Led by junior center Kelsey Bone, 
who is third in the Southeastern Con-ference with 17.1 points per game, Tex-as A&M (19-5, 9-1 SEC) has returned to form after dropping its first three con-tests this season.

� YOUNG RECORDED 12 POINTS 
AND 11 REBOUNDS AGAINST NOEL.

Before Tuesday, Kentucky’s Nerlens 
Noel was dominant in the paint.
Noel entered Tuesday’s contest against 
the Gators leading the NCAA with 4.5 
blocks per game and averaging nearly a double-double with 10.6 points and 9.6 rebounds.
Utilizing his length and athleticism, the 
freshman had helped the Wildcats hold opposing teams to 40.6 percent shooting on attempts inside the arc. 
But Noel did not rattle junior Patric 
Young on Tuesday night.
“I tried to come into the game saying, 
‘It’s just another game. It’s another good big man. I’m going to come in and do the best I can and do my job, keep him off the boards and just run the floor,’” Young said. 
Tuesday’s matchup was not just an-
other game for Young. He recorded 12 points, 11 rebounds and four blocks in No. 7 Florida’s 69-52 win against No. 25 Kentucky in the O’Connell Center. 
“When he gives incredible effort, plays 
with a really good motor, [Young’s] ca-pable of getting double-doubles every night,” Donovan said.
Noel scored only eight points in 23 
minutes before leaving the game with 8:03 remaining after suffering an ACL tear in his left knee. 
Young, who averaged 6.6 boards per 
game heading into Tues-day, outrebounded Noel 10-6 before the UK cen-ter’s early exit.  
Young drew two of 
the three fouls called against Noel. The fresh-man center sat the final 6:26 of the first half after 
picking up his second. 
In 24 minutes, Young made 5 of 7 at-
tempts from the field.
All of his field goals came within a few 
feet of the basket. Florida took only 14 three-point attempts — its second-lowest total this year — as it found success pen-etrating the paint and shooting 51.2 per -Center excels against top talent

19-point, 11-rebound effort. 
“She’s bigger than some of the 
post players we have come against, 
and she is very, very strong,” junior center Vicky McIntyre said. “That’s something we are just going to have to figure out how to deal with. It’s just going to be a tough game over -
all.”
Texas A&M won the 2011 national 
title and is a likely candidate to con-tend for a Final Four appearance this season.
UF, meanwhile, has not beaten a 
ranked team this season.
Butler knows the matchup against 
Texas A&M gives Florida a chance to earn its first true statement victory of the 2012-13 campaign. 
“It’s a fantastic opportunity,” But-
ler said.
“It’s a great chance to not only 
get a league win against one of the teams tied for the league lead, but also do that on the road. I think that would really solidify who we think we are.” 
Junior guard Jaterra Bonds leads 
the Gators in scoring during confer -
ence play with 14.7 points per game. 
Her ability to contend with Court-
ney Walker, the SEC Freshman of the Week and the Aggies’ second-lead-ing scorer, will be as important as the Gators’ ability to limit Bone.
Bonds has made just one NCAA 
Tournament appearance. She hopes to better her chances of making an-other run to the Big Dance while helping Butler collect some delayed gratification.“[Butler] has mentioned it to us,” 
Bonds said. “That is something we are going to take personal. We want to get out there and win it for her, because that’s where her career end-ed.”

Center Patric Young (4) attempts a layup during UF’s 69-52 win against UK on Tuesday in the O’Connell Center.
Texas A&M won national title in 2011cent on two-point attempts. 
“We knew that Nerlens was able to block a lot of shots 
and not only block them, but just alter them and make you 
think about, ‘Oh, he’s coming to block my shot help side,’” Young said. “So we knew today that if we attack the basket, you had to go up aggressive.”
After picking up a foul less than 2 minutes into the game, 
Young did not commit one for the remainder of the contest. 
A handful of acrobatic plays highlighted his perfor -
mance.
Young’s most impressive offensive play was a reverse 
layup with 19:33 remaining. After receiving a bounce pass from senior forward Erik Murphy, Young curled around Noel in the post to find net.
But Young’s defense earned air time on ESPN’s Sports-
Center with one of the top 10 plays on Tuesday.
After Wildcats guard Archie Goodwin stole the ball from 
Young, the UF center chased Goodwin down the lane and rejected his layup.
“My favorite kind of block is when I get to chase some-
body down from behind, and they don’t see me coming, and I smack it,” Young said. “I was able to do that a few times.”
Fatigue has been an issue for Young throughout his ca-
reer, but he ran the floor well on Tuesday.
At the 12:10 mark of the second half, Young dashed to the 
other end and beat Noel on a layup to put the Gators ahead 53-38. 
Young’s teammates fed off his intensity. “It just felt like he was laying it all on the line for our 
team,” guard Mike Rosario said. “That’s what we need out of our big guy.”

After ending the first round tied for second,  Flor -
ida finished a disappointing fifth at the Northrop 
Grumman Regional Challenge in Palos Verdes, Ca-lif.
The three-round tournament, which mostly fea-
tured western schools, was Florida’s second compe-tition of the spring.
The Gators were coming off a win at the Florida 
Challenge on Jan. 28, but they could not translate their momentum into a victory at the Palos Verdes Golf Club. 
Florida trailed eventual champion UCLA by 
only two shots after the first round but finished 22 strokes behind. 
UF was looking for its fourth win of the season 
behind the play of sophomore Camilla Hedberg and senior Isabelle Lendl.
Hedberg shot six over for the tournament (219) 
and finished in eighth place. She was tied for second in the first round.
Lendl finished tied for 22nd after shooting 11 
over par (224).    
Hedberg entered the final day in position to po-
tentially win the tournament after finishing the sec-ond round in a second-place tie.
Hedberg lost her opportunity by shooting five over par (76) in the championship round.
Eventual champion Erynee Lee from UCLA was 
the only player to finish at even par (213) during the three-day tourney in Palos verdes.  
Lendl never played up to her potential. Rounds 
of 74, 75 and 75 prevented her from contending for the individual title.   
The disappointment goes past just the play of 
Hedberg and Lendl. 
Senior Mia Piccio, who was coming off a victory 
at the Lady Bulldog Individual Championship, fell out of contention when she shot seven over par in the second round (78) and five over par in the final round (76).
Elcin Ulu had the worst finish of any Gator. Ulu 
shot eight over par (79) in the first round and 12 over par (83) in the second round before shooting her tournament low four over par (75) in the final round. 
Still, there was a bright spot for Florida. Anna Young, who began the tournament with a 
78.1 stroke average  in every round, finished with a 74 (+3) in the first and third rounds.
She finished the tournament tied for 25th with a 
225 (+12).

petition at the Allstate Sugar Bowl in New Orleans on Feb. 24. UF places fourth in Grumman ChallengeWOMEN’S GOLF

Jacksonville took control against No. 3 
Florida at the opening draw. The Dolphins 
stayed patient, holding the ball for the first 3 minutes of the game without attempting a shot on goal.
At the 27:06 mark during the first half, 
Jacksonville’s Nikki Ederly bounced the ball  underneath UF goalie Mikey Meagher’s stick to give JU a 1-0 lead. 
After a quick, failed shot by the Gators, the 
Dolphins controlled the ball for another 3:30  before turning it over.
Then the Gators got going.Senior Kitty Cullen weaved in and out of 
the JU defense, nailing the ball in the top of the net to tie the game 1-1 with 22:42 remaining.
Six minutes later, Florida extended the 
score to 4-1.
UF tacked on streaks of four and five 
straight goals later in the game, never giving Jacksonville a chance.
Florida is 2-0 for only the second time in 
program history after defeating Jacksonville (1-2) 15-4 on the road Wednesday night. 
The Gators are undefeated in four contests 
against the Dolphins, winning by an average margin of 9.8 goals per game.“The goals were off feeds and off drives,” 
senior Gabi Wiegand said. “We were just kind of seeing what the defense was doing and giv-ing us, and we just took our opportunities.”
Wiegand continued her early success this 
season by scoring five goals against Jack-sonville, upping her 2013 total to seven. She scored twice during a 5-3 win against North Carolina on Saturday in Chapel Hill, N.C.
“[Wiegand] not only scored in [one-on-one 
situations], she scored in transition, she scored around the crease,” coach Amanda O’Leary said. “She was just a threat everywhere.”
Wiegand has 10 goals in two games against 
the Dolphins.
Other than the first 6:30 of the game, the 
Gators were in command on draw controls and ground balls.
Florida led 13-8 in draw controls and 19-8 
in ground balls.
“Anytime you can hold possession of the 
ball, the other team can’t score,” O’Leary said. “You can’t score without the ball.”
All but one of the Gators’ 12 starters 
scooped up a ground ball during the game.Florida forced 10 turnovers compared to 
five giveaways.
“Our team competed really hard,” O’Leary said. “It’s doing the dirty work, and I think that’s where we really did a good job [Wednes-day night].”

Briana Little had a big hit on 
Wednesday night.
Little hit a grand slam to 
help Florida earn an 11-3 victory 
against Jacksonville at the JU Soft-ball Complex in Jacksonville. The homer was Little’s only hit of the night, but it was more than enough for UF.
“After letting the first pitch go, 
I knew if she pitched it down the middle again, I was going to hit it hard,” Little said. “I just relaxed and watched it fly out there.”
The sophomore outfielder’s shot 
came in front of familiar eyes. The Middleburg native found comfort playing near her hometown.
“It was really nice to have my 
parents and friends from home come see me play,” Little said. “It definitely helps having that sup-port.”
The Dolphins took a 1-0 lead in 
the third, but sophomore Bailey Castro stepped 
got the Gators on the board.
Castro tied 
the score in the fourth with a solo home run, sparking a three-run inning.
“I just felt su-
per excited knowing I helped my team out,” Castro said.
Florida took advantage of Jack-
sonville starter Taylor Rossman on Wednesday night. The Gators tagged the freshman hurler for 11 runs on 10 hits.
“We did a great job coming 
back after the third and not giving into Jacksonville’s tougher play-ers,” coach Tim Walton said.
Freshman Kelsey Stewart was 
another key contributor to UF’s of-fensive barrage. She finished 3 for 5 at the plate. Stewart’s third hit was a two-run triple.
“Kelsey really plays hard out 
there and raises the level for us,” Little said.
Despite a productive night with 
the bats, the Gators only needed Little’s grand slam.
Alhough Hannah Rogers did 
not pitch up to her usual stan-dards, she still surrendered only three runs on seven hits in seven innings of work. She fanned five batters and walked five.
“We have a lot of strong players 
that contributed great plays,” Cas-tro said. “But, it took all [16] of us to get that win.”
