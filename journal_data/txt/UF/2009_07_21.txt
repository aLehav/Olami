In a small den on the west side of the Santa Fe College 
Teaching Zoo, there are now four Asian small-clawed ot-
ters, two more than there used to be.
First-time parents Jay and Lakena welcomed two otter 
pups to the zoo on April 30, but the pups did not come 
out of their den until recently, said Jonathan Miot, assistant 
director of the Teaching Zoo. The Zoo waited about three months to publicize their arrival, until the otter parents brought their pups out from the den.
In the wild, Asian small-clawed otters keep their young 
in a den until they are able to open their eyes, which can take six to eight weeks. 
Miot said the Teaching Zoo wanted to do the same for 
Jay and Lakena.
Since being out of the den, the parents have been teach-
ing the pups how to swim by dunking them in a small pool in their cage.
Miot said they did not appreciate the dunking at first 
but are now getting used to the water.
The pups have not been named because their gender 
isn’t determined yet, said Emi Willows, a SFC student who works at the zoo. 
Miot said the zoo is very pleased with the way the par-
ents have been raising the pups and do not want to inter-fere to check their sex.
The best time to see the animals is around 9 a.m. when 
the zoo opens or when it is cloudy outside. They like cooler weather, said Miot.

In the first of what will likely be many 
meetings, UF President Bernie Machen dis-
cussed student safety with the owner and general manager of The Jacksonville Landing on Friday.
Janice Lowe, general manager of the strip 
of shops and restaurants, said Friday’s hour-long discussion was very general, with little mention of Machen’s requested changes to festivities surrounding the game.
Last month, Machen, along with UF’s Vice 
President for Student Affairs, Patricia Telles-Irvin, sent a letter to Jacksonville Mayor John Peyton asking him to make a number of 
changes, many of which would affect the Landing.
The changes included 
limiting the occupancy 
to the fire marshal’s stan-
dards to about 2,500 peo-
ple on the outside patio and courtyard, banning the sale of liquor shots, halving the number of 
temporary alcohol vendors and increasing the presence of the Division of Alcoholic Bev-Machen discusses safetyBy THOMAS STEWART

Bruce Kone, former dean of UF’s Col-
lege of Medicine, will receive $517,000 
over the next three years as part of a res-ignation settlement that went into effect this month.
UF officials sent a proposed dismissal 
notice to Kone in April after they deter-mined he authored anonymous e-mails and a letter that disparaged UF officials. He allegedly sent them to applicants for the senior vice president for health af-fairs position.
Kone denied writing the e-mails or 
letter, according to the 49-page settle-
ment.
Kone was removed as dean of the 
College of Medicine in May 2008, about a month after he decided to overrule a 
medical school’s admissions committee and admit a student with political con-nections who had not taken the MCAT.
After a meeting with UF officials to 
explain his decision, Kone sent out a 
scathing e-mail to the officials.
“It’s a small town. There are small 
minds,” he 
wrote, accord-ing to Alligator archives. “But 
for crap’s sakes, and speaking strictly as an alumnus, wake up. You are talented. Start leading.”
After being removed as dean, Kone 
stayed on as a professor in the college.
In the e-mails that led to his dismissal, 
Kone allegedly attempted to persuade candidates not to come to UF.Kone to receive $517K

See Story, Page 22.After giving a fake name to a Gainesville 
Police Department officer, a man was arrest-
ed when he was discovered to have mari-juana and two outstanding arrest warrants.
Alphonso Baker, 31, was pulled over 
while driving on State Road 121 for an im-proper tag display.
Baker got out of the car, gave his name 
as Joseph Welch, his date of birth as Nov. 20, 2009, and stated that he had no form of ID on him, according to the arrest report.After a short time, Baker told the officer 
he was not Welch and that he used a fake name because he had two outstanding ar-rest warrants and didn’t want to go to jail.
While searching his car, the officer found 
seven plastic bags containing a total of five grams of marijuana. Baker was arrested and charged with giving a false name to a law enforcement officer and sale or possession with intent to sell a controlled substance.

Minister charged with 
stealing from church 
LAKE CITY, Fla. (AP) — 
Authorities said a minister has 
been arrested for stealing more 
than $250,000 from a Lake City church.
The Columbia County Sher-
iff’s Office said 61-year-old Samuel Darin Taylor was ar-
rested Tuesday and charged 
with money laundering, mort-gage fraud, racketeering, con-
spiracy to commit grand theft 
and scheming with intent to defraud.
Detectives first began in-
vestigating Taylor last month after the First Assembly of God 
board and bookkeeper noticed 
accounting discrepancies.
Authorities are also looking 
for another suspect they believe was working with Taylor.
The minister was being held 
on $50,000 bail.

Next summer, the Student Health Care 
Center at UF, known as the Infirmary, will 
move from the center of campus to Radio Road, near the Lakeside Residential Com-
plex.
First, though, Student Mental Health Ser-
vices and the Counseling Center will merge 
their services and relocate to the new center 
near Lakeside, with plans to open in the sum-mer of 2010, said counseling center director Sherry Benton, who will be director of the 
new mental health services organization.
The new center will cost about $7.7 mil-
lion. 
The building will be funded by the Capital Improvement Trust Fund, which is supported by student fees at state universities, according 
to project manager Scott Whiddon.
Funding for the building was secured four 
or five years ago, Whiddon said.
It is unclear when construction on the sec-
ond phase of the project will begin, which 
will allow the rest of UF’s health services to 
occupy the building, Whiddon said.
The decision to move health services out 
of its current location on Fletcher Drive, sur-
rounded by the most-used classroom build-ings in the core of campus, was made to al-
leviate high demand at the current health center. 
Initially, UF sought to expand on the cur-
rent site but found it would require too much restructuring, Whiddon said.
Benton said the move worries her because it’ll mean a longer trip for some students seek-
ing medical attention.
“On the other hand, many thousands 
make it to Southwest [Recreation Center] ev-
ery week,” she said.
She said the new facility will have more 
parking and a covered bus stop.
“In some ways, it’ll be more convenient, in 
some ways it’ll be a little less convenient,” she 
said, “depending on where you have your classes.”
 Combining the two this year was done 
as a result of budget cuts, with the merger expected to save UF about $520,000 a year, 
though the two will not merge into the single facility until 2010.
However, Benton said, UF has considered 
the move for about 25 years and has watched other universities do the same with positive results.
Benton said the merger will not involve 
any layoffs, though three already empty posi-
tions were left unfilled due to cuts.
Also, she said, students should still receive 
the same level of care, if not better.
“We have such an opportunity to rein-
vent ourselves,” she said. “This is one case 
where budget cuts may result in positive out-comes.”On c AMpuS

The Shakespearean tragedy of a 
young man’s quest for power will 
be transformed by the UF School 
of Theatre and Dance in its perfor-mance of “Macbeth.”
Under the direction of UF grad-
uate Matthew Gordon-Martin, the 
show will stray from the tradition-al performance written by William 
Shakespeare.
With a cast of 10 people playing 
multiple roles each, the show opens Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. in the Na-dine McGuire Black Box Theatre and will run through Sunday.
“It is very animalistic, raw and 
movement-oriented,” said stage manager Breanna Stroud, adding that the severely cut script can be 
described as “nitty-gritty, hardcore 
Shakespeare.”
With this new adaptation of the play, Gordon-Martin, 22, said he hopes to break away from tradi-
tional theater.
“I feel that commercializing 
theater tries to dumb it down and 
insults the intellec-
tual capacity of our 
audiences,” he said. 
“My point is not for 
the audience to get 100 percent of ‘Macbeth.’ If they come away with 
something, I’ll be happy.”
This adaptation of “Macbeth” 
has presented many challenges for its actors.
“The movement component has 
been such a large obstacle to over-
come,” said Alex Hernandez, a se-nior acting major who will play the character of Macbeth. “It’s almost like taking a step back to the cave-
man days.”
Gordon-Martin, who received 
his bachelor’s degree in acting at 
UF in May, said this will be his first 
time directing a production at the 
university.
Although he said audience members will experience some-thing they have never seen before, 
he said this performance will have 
a familiar theme. 
“How we make choices and 
how they impact society is some-thing we can all connect to,” he 
said.
Tickets for the hour and a half 
performance are $12 for students 
and senior citizens and $16 for the 
general public. They are on sale

A reception was held Friday 
to commemorate the opening of 
the exhibit, which began July 10 
and will remain on display until Aug. 20.
The photos reflect the perspec-
tives and experiences of UF stu-dents and faculty on themes such as iconic local features, Gator pride and students’ experiences abroad.
Jill Keezer, assistant director at the Center for Student Activi-ties and Involvement, organized the exhibit to give students with-
out professional photography ex-
perience a chance to display their work in a juried competition.
Keezer issued a call for sub-
missions asking for entries “that capture the spirit and culture of the University of Florida.”
More than 200 entries were re-
ceived, and a jury selected 55 to put on display. 
Gina Masi, a former intern at 
the gallery who was present at the reception, said the selection committee was made up of em-ployees the Reitz Union and Stu-
dent Affairs.
Vice President of Student Af-
fairs Patricia Telles-Irvin will 
choose the top three entries to receive a $100 “purchase award” 
in August, Keezer said. The three 
photos will go on permanent dis-play in the Office of Student Af-fairs. 
The other entries will remain 
on display around the Union or other campus areas, Keezer said.4, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, JULY 21, 2009

The College of Liberal Arts and Sci-
ences will have fewer deans starting next 
month, saving the college money and mak-
ing things more efficient, according to the college’s dean, Paul D’Anieri.
The college will downsize from six as-sociate deans to five.
Under the new structure, each depart-
ment or center in the college will be as-signed an associate dean, D’Anieri wrote 
in an e-mail.
As a result, each department or center 
will report to its associate dean as opposed to the current structure, in which faculty 
from all 40 units in the college report di-rectly to D’Anieri.“[I]t’s simply not pos-
sible for me to have the depth of knowledge about each unit or to re-
spond as quickly as will 
be possible in the new 
model,” D’Anieri wrote 
in the e-mail.
He wrote that the col-
lege may spend some of its savings from the restructuring on hiring more staff.
“One goal of the reorganization is [to] 
ensure that associate deans are not doing 
tasks that could be done more effectively and less expensively by professional staff,” 
he wrote.
Three of the new associate dean posi-
tions are new hires, with one current as-sociate dean remaining in place and one 
former associate dean returning to the po-sition.

Tebow discusses love 
life in gossip site video
� HE WAS IN L.A. FOR THE 
2009 ESPY AWARDS. 
Good news, ladies — Tim 
Tebow is single.
At least that’s what the UF 
quarterback said in a video post-
ed Wednesday on TMZ.com.
The video was filmed Tuesday 
at Los Angeles International Air-
port. Tebow was in town to at-
tend the filming of the 2009 ESPY 
Awards, which aired Sunday night.
In the 30-second video, Tebow 
is asked while signing autographs 
for fans if he would be looking 
for a new girldriend while in town and whether he would be partying.
But Tebow said in the video 
that he doesn’t have a girlfriend and wouldn’t be on the prowl in Los Angeles.
“We’ll just be hanging out,” he 
said.
Steve McClain, spokesman for the University Athletic As-sociation, was at the airport with Tebow when the TMZ camera ap-proached them.
“TMZ is certainly a media out-
let that we’re not used to having around or that we see quite often in our world,” McClain said.
“They were pretty much 
camped out at the airport grabbing ev-eryone who came through,” he said of 
the reporters at the 
airport. “It was a pretty high-
profile event.”
The event was hosted by Sam-
uel L. Jackson and attendees in-
cluded Andy Samberg and Kobe 
Bryant.
McClain said Tebow has no 
problem dealing with that type of 
publicity, given all his experience 
with the media.
“Tim was pretty well-versed 
with dealing with the media be-
fore he got here,” he said.

 U.S News & World Report ranked Shands 
at UF among the top 50 hospitals in the coun-
try in its annual ranking.
The hospital was ranked in seven out of 16 
specialties, including 24th for heart and heart surgery, by U.S. News’ annual America’s Best Hospitals list released Wednesday. 
Out of the 4,861 hospitals considered, few-
er than 0.4 percent were ranked in a specialty, according to the report. 
The hospital placed 45th in cancer, 38th in 
diabetes and endocrine systems, 38th in ear, nose and throat, 27th in gynecology, 25th in geriatric care and 27th in urology. 
“To be ranked in seven [specialties] really 
puts you in a small universe,” said Avery Co-marow, U.S. News’ health rankings editor. 
“To appear at all in one specialty is a big deal. 
These are elite hospitals.”
The magazine also named Shands at UF 
the best hospital in Florida for heart and heart surgery, urology and geriatric care, according to a Shands news release. 
“We are proud to be named No. 1 in Flori-
da,” said Jamie Beth Conti, professor of medi-cine and interim chief for the UF’s College of 
Medicine division of cardiovascular disease, 
which encompasses the heart and heart sur-geries area. “The faculty is delighted to be rec-ognized for our efforts to provide exceptional cardiovascular care.” 
Shands at UF received the same rankings 
in 2008.   “There’s usually not an awful lot of 
change,” Comarow said, referring to the fact that UF’s ranking remained the same in all of the seven categories. “There’s not a lot of movement near the top.”
The rankings for the categories in which 
UF was listed were calculated based on repu-tation, death rate, patient safety and other care-related factors. Reputation was based on specialist surveys. 
The magazine only considered teaching 
hospitals, hospitals that had 200 or more beds or hospitals that had 100 beds and four out of eight key technologies for its list. 
John Hopkins Hospital was ﬁ  rst on the list 
for the 18th consecutive year.

Two UF researchers create the world’s 
largest synthetic diamond, packing 1,600 
carats at a whopping 11 inches in diam-eter.
The feat was accomplished by inject-
ing a solution of suspended diamond particles into a silicon disk. After chemi-cal processing, the scientists were left with their record-breaking result.
“Making the world’s largest diamond 
was just serendipity,” said James Adair, one of the researchers involved. “It wasn’t our goal.”
Some scientists believe synthetic dia-
monds have many potential uses, such as wear coating on jet airplanes, or a smaller, faster replacement for silicon in computer circuitry.

Two dozen hippies stage a love-in, 
painting themselves, blowing bubbles and handing out ﬂ  owers to puzzled spec-tators on UF’s Plaza of the Americas.
“It’s a basic love experience,” said or-
ganizer Les Lewis. “With the world at war we lose sight of some of the simpler things life has to offer.”
Participants say Gainesville was the 
home of a large hippie population, stating more would have shown up to the event if it had been better planned. The love-in lasted a little more than an hour.

Sen. John F. Kennedy (D-Mass.) is an-
nounced as the main speaker for the Flori-da Blue Key Homecoming banquet.
The topic of his speech has yet to be 
determined, but it would be conﬁ  rmed 
that Sen. Kennedy would be introduced 
by his close friend, Florida Sen. George Smathers.
Ironically, in the original article, the Al-
ligator falsely reports the Senator’s name as John S. Kennedy, marring the future-president’s famous middle initial.
“(It) comes from his mother’s side,” 
said William Link, a UF American history professor. “(Her) father, “Honey Fitz” (John Fitzgerald), was a Boston Irish po-litico.”
With his parents’ marriage, the Ken-
nedy name was attached to a political family, becoming one of the most famous political lineages in U.S. history. Top-ranked Shands Specialties:

America lacks vision after moonwalk
Today’s question: Should ADHD 
medicines be prescribed to young children?
253 TOTAL VOTES47% YES53% NOThursday’s question: Is Gainesville mean to the homeless?Disappearing ActDrug Busted
Doctors shouldn’t work 
for drug companies
In George Orwell’s “1984,” 
the three slogans of the ruling party are “War is 
Peace,” “Freedom is Slavery” and “Ignorance is Strength.” 
Amazon.com might as well 
change its slogan to “Down-loading is Deletion” after this weekend.
Copies of Orwell’s “1984” 
and “Animal Farm” disap-peared from e-books across the country after Amazon.com officials realized they 
didn’t own the rights required 
to put the novels on Kindle, its e-book service. People who paid for the books are angry about the sudden electronic evaporation of their property.
More important than 
Amazon.com’s customer ser-vice issues, however, is this: 
What happens when all of 
our information exists in bits and bytes? The fact that this involves those specific books is ironic, but the realization that companies could one day have the ability to “delete” in-formation from our personal libraries, mirroring the idea of Orwell’s dystopian vision, is nothing less than harrowing. 
OK, so, we recognize that 
the invention of Kindle didn’t cause the Library of Congress to go up in flames. Books don’t seem to be going anywhere, even if they may be “obso-lete,” technically. But then again, is imagining a world in which people rely on e-read-
ers to access their literature 
any different than imagining a world in which most people get their news from electronic newspapers and blogs? 
Besides the fact that Ama-
zon.com isn’t doing a good job of convincing people to jump on the Kindle bandwagon, 
they are not assuring us that 
our information and property will remain, well, ours, as we move toward an increasingly electronic future. And that is downright Orwellian.Ritalin. Concerta. Vyvanse. Adderall. The Editorial Board is willing to bet that you know at least one person who has been prescribed one of them.
These drugs have been championed by well-known Harvard 
psychologist Joseph Biederman for decades. As a result, doctors 
have increasingly prescribed the medicines to those who may 
or may not need them.
Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, investigated 
Biederman’s drug company affiliations. It turns out Biederman worked as a private consultant for some drug companies, earn-ing at least $1.6 million in the past seven years for his “advice,” according to The Boston Globe.
Grassley identified the conflict of interest that arises when 
the person who sets the precedent for how psychotropic drugs 
are dispensed is connected to drug companies. Both the compa-
nies and Biederman make bank as the drugs are dispersed.
We know there are cases when ADHD medications are nec-
essary, but we are vindicated by this investigation, which shows that these drugs are often prescribed for the wrong reasons.
School systems push the drugs when young children are 
unable to keep still or concentrate for long periods. Those kids might be the next great ballet dancer, the next great novelist or just too damn smart to pay attention to “Dick and Jane” books.
The Editorial Board would like to assert that sedation is not 
the answer for those who might not fit into the paradigm of “eager student.” Putting children who cannot understand the risks of drug addiction on drugs is a shame. Promoting drugs to these kids to make money is absolutely criminal.
We would like to note that intellectual might doesn’t always 
make right. We urge parents who’ve thought about putting their children on drugs to think twice before damning them to a lifetime of pill-popping when they may not need it. 
Walter Cronkite died Friday evening. He was 92. 
I think it’s fitting that the 40th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moonwalk Monday is so close to 
Cronkite’s death. Out of all the clips of Cronkite’s broad-casts shown over the past few days, the veteran journalist seems least inhibited during the now famed broadcast of the lunar landing. Cronkite had even remarked that the Apollo 11 landing was the high point in his career because he was certain it would be the most important event of his lifetime. Unfortunately, it seems he was correct. 
Before I go any further, I should mention that I am 
one of those jerks in every restaurant who mutters aloud, 
“We can put a man on the moon; you’d think they could 
make my chicken salad faster.” It’s true; I am an unre-lenting Apollo program nut. I’ve always been enthralled by the whole romanticism of a nation’s leader setting an 
ambitious goal and then actually starting the process of 
meeting the goal. There had to have been something com-
forting about knowing hundreds of thousands of people were working on a collective objective to not only better their country but humanity as a whole.
I’m not that naïve, though, and am aware that our rea-
sons for going to the moon had more to do with beating the Soviets than inspiring a nation. 
Still, we went to the moon! And we walked on it, too! 
We won the race to the moon, and in doing so we gained a more complete knowledge of the totality of our existence. I don’t think we’ve accomplished anything close to what we did since then. We certainly haven’t had a president since who’s challenged the nation the way President John F. Kennedy did with his bold promise. Kennedy offered us a new frontier, and for too long we haven’t searched the horizon for the next one. 
Even now, when history has offered us yet another bold and young president, the chance to meet the line that di-vides a mediocre generation from a visionary generation is missed. Take for instance President Barack Obama’s and the now Super Ma-jority Democratic Congress’ plan for combating global warming. Presently, a typical and hackneyed 
response has been thought up to fight what could very well be the most important threat of a generation.
Essentially, we’ve brought a knife to a gunfight. The 
knife? Cap and Trade policies, which according to the Co-penhagen Consensus Center are promised to reduce 0.3 to 0.5 degrees by the year 2100 of what many believe will be a temperature increase from anywhere from 1 to 11.5 
degrees. We’ve reveled in the mundane yet again and 
have failed to reach for a new frontier. 
I am convinced, much as many of you are, that we des-
perately need another Apollo-like program to solve not 
just global warming but our dwindling energy supplies and broken health and education systems as well. So far, nothing proposed out of Washington could have ever made Cronkite speechless, much the same way man’s journey into heaven’s orbit more than 40 years ago did. Visionary thinking is missing. Even when bold policy is announced, such as Obama’s health care and global warming directives, eventual legislation is watered down with tax cuts and pork barrel spending. 
Maybe history will judge the moonwalk as an easier 
task than asking Congress to forget about running for re-election and pass meaningful legislation for once.

Dreams are probably one of my favorite things in the 
world. And, boy, have I had some doozies. 
For example, it’s now 1 o’ clock Monday, and I 
just woke up from one of the strangest dreams I’ve had of late. I was sitting at a banquet table with various friends of 
mine, and we were eating dinner and cracking jokes. At a 
table a short distance away were all the great, dead Greek philosophers and writers, who I have so little affection for. There was Thucydides, Euripides, Antisthenes and a very fat and swarthy Epicurus. Well, they thought we were being loud; we thought they were being loud, and, for some rea-son, the two groups began to exchange harsh words. I recall loudly mocking Epicurus at one point. We then made fun of the ancient Greeks’ relationships with young boys and, 
finally, taunted them because — after all — we know just 
when their civilization gets clobbered.
They ended up wanting to fight us in the parking lot of 
wherever we were, and we gladly accepted — only to realize that the ancient Greeks were on steroids. It suffices to say that I woke up before the battle could be joined.
I think something may be wrong with me. These dreams 
are just a touch odd.
Another staple in my repertoire is the dream wherein I 
realize that I’m dreaming. These are my favorites. They don’t come along all too often or with any predictability, but when they do, it’s fantastic. When I realize I’m dreaming, I tend to be able to do anything I like. Usually that results in me flying around.
If only such were life.Let me tell you about one of my all time favorites, though. Those of you who know me will know that I fancy myself something of a writer and have, in fact, been writing stories for some time. Those of you who know me better will know that 
Jack Nicholson is one of my personal 
heroes.
Well, once, in what can only be 
called a gift from Morpheus, Lord of Dreams (it’s a reference, Philistines),  
I had one of my most absurd dreams.
It went a little something like this: For some reason, I was 
at a carnival, just walking along the boardwalk. Then I met none other but Mr. Nicholson himself. He imparted some in-
consequential advice to me, and, next thing I knew, we were 
in a restaurant discussing life. He took a long drink of whis-key and did his “Indians” thing from the film “Easy Rider.” He then read one of my stories, looked at me solemnly and said (imagine the Nicholson voice) “You can do it, kid. You can be a writer!” My spirits were lifted immediately, and I was filled, in Dreamland, with a vast reserve of confidence. Nicholson then stood up, said “follow me” and dashed out on the check, knocking a table out of his way as he fled.
Dreams are truly amazing. They allow us to type into the 
deepest realms of our psyches, and even if they don’t make sense to us later, they do when we have them. And it’s that moment of clarity that makes it all worthwhile. I suggest to all my readers that you make time for more sleeping.

Machen’s ‘threat’ ludicrous
UF President Bernie Machen has asked the city 
of Jacksonville to cut down the number of alcohol 
vendor licenses it issues, curb the ability of private 
businesses with legally obtained liquor licenses to 
serve and create more safety zones for students... 
and foot the bill for all of it.
The UF-Georgia football contract is up after the 
2010 season, and Machen is saying that UF may not 
renew if his demands are not met.
Personally, I laugh at the suggestion.I hope Machen realizes a few things. The major-
ity of people drinking in Jacksonville are not UF or even University of Georgia students.
To most UF alumni, this is the most important 
rivalry game, and he risks alienating both them 
and their wallets by messing with a tradition that is 
older than he is. Urban Meyer has stated he is 100 
percent behind keeping the game in Jacksonville.
Finally, UF makes more money when the game 
is hosted in Jacksonville than if it is hosted in the Swamp every other year.
Add it all up, and I’ll be taking a shot in honor 
of the game in Jacksonville on Oct. 31 this year, at 
the Landing.

Thirteen leaders from the People’s 
Republic of China, a North Central 
Florida health clinic and the U.S. De-partment of State may seem like a mixed bunch, but the groups united 
Monday for a common purpose.
On Monday, 13 emerging Chinese 
leaders visited WellFlorida Council 
health clinic in Gainesville, the Ala-chua County Organization for Rural Needs clinic in Brooker, Fla., Trenton Medical Center in Trenton, Fla., and Suwannee River Health Education Center in Alachua.
They are participating in an in-
ternational program to study rural economic development and poverty alleviation through health care.
The Chinese leaders were chosen 
by the U.S. Department of State’s In-ternational Visitor Leadership Pro-gram, which has hosted emerging leaders from all over the world to ob-
serve American programs in a variety 
of categories since 1940, according to Monika Wilcox, program officer for the Academy for Educational Devel-opment. 
The Academy is a nonprofit orga-
nization that planned the three-week trip lasting from July 13 to 31. 
Other destinations include Wash-
ington, Syracuse, N.Y., New York City, Orlando, St. Louis, Kansas City and San Francisco. 
According to Wilcox, WellFlorida 
was chosen as a place of interest be-cause of its diverse geography, cul-ture and services provided to rural farmers. 
WellFlorida is the largest of the 11 
local health clinics in the state. It cov-ers 16 counties, most of them rural communities, said Jeff Feller, chief op-
erations officer. 
WellFlorida partners with UF, 
Shands HealthCare, the Alachua 
County Health Department, North Florida Regional Hospital and CHOICES, Alachua County’s health services program, to conduct a com-munity health needs assessment. 
“Outcomes are a lot worse for rural 
residents,” Feller said. “Out of the 25 leading causes of death in Florida, 21 of them are worse for rural residents than urban residents. That gives you an idea of what they’re up against.” 
WellFlorida’s Rural Health Part-
nership program tries to help north 
central Florida rural residents gain more ac-
cess to health care. 
“We emphasize co-
operation over competition,” said 
Kendra Siler-Marsiglio, Rural Health Partnership program manager.
This theory of cooperation over 
competition is one the Chinese lead-ers said they will take with them back to their country.
“They also want to encourage pub-
lic and private health care providers to work together instead of compet-ing with each other, and they plan on encouraging their government to dedicate more money to rural health,” Siler-Marsiglio said. “They really have an opportunity [to make a difference] because some of these areas in China 
are untouched, so they can do it the 
right way from scratch instead of try-ing to fix problems as they arrive like we have.”
Feller said these visitors were a 
group of “heavy-hitters.”
“As their brand of capitalism 
emerges, so too will their health care system,” he said.8, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, JULY 21, 2009

UF professor Jill Ciment’s novel “Heroic Mesaures” appears on Oprah 
Winfrey’s Summer Reading list.
Chinese leaders learn 
from Fla. health clinicsBy JESSICA CHAPMAN
Alligator Writer
It’s a story about a dog and her 
family, and it’s one of Oprah Win-
frey’s 25 favorite of the summer. 
UF creative writing professor 
Jill Ciment’s novel “Heroic Mea-
sures” is the second book on Win-frey’s annual summer reading list, 
which highlights Winfrey’s top 
suggestions for summer reading.
“Heroic Measures” is the first 
novel to be offered as a free down-
load to Oprah.com members. 
“It’s the coolest thing around,” 
Ciment said. “I’m so jazzed that it’s being offered to the two million members of her book club.”
Focusing on the media and 
the real estate industry, Ciment’s 208-page novel tells the story of the elderly Cohen couple, whose 12-year-old dachshund, Dorothy, is suddenly paralyzed in her hind legs just as the couple decides to sell their East Village apartment.
At the same time, a gas tanker 
truck driven by a man named Ab-dul jackknifes in a tunnel in what the media deem a terrorist attack.As news of the tanker contin-
ues to grow and lower the value of their 45-year home, the Cohens must help Dorothy and face leav-ing their home amid a crisis.
The book, which is also on The 
Wall Street Journal’s summer read-ing list, was inspired by a lost cat poster Ciment saw in New York City the day before the Sept. 11 ter-rorist attacks, Ciment said. 
She said as the days went by, 
families posted pictures of missing 
loved ones near the cat poster, but 
they didn’t cover it, she said.
“I’ve always been an animal 
lover,” Ciment said, adding it took 
her three years to write the novel. 
“[Writing books is] the type of pro-
fession that you spend four or five 
years [on one],” she said.  
Ciment said she is excited her book made Winfrey’s list, and she believes Winfrey is one of the few people who can keep Americans reading. 
“Oprah’s doing an amazing 
thing,” Ciment said. “She’s one of the few people to keep book read-ing alive. [She] fills a void in a cul-ture that doesn’t really have any books.” 
Ciment said she is excited to be 
a part a new electronic age, where electronic books could become the norm.
“I’m excited to be a part of 
that,” she said. “It’s every writer’s dream.” 
“Heroic Measures” will be of-
fered on Winfrey’s Web site until 10:59 p.m. on Wednesday.
Ciment began her book tour 
earlier this month and hopes to fin-ish by August. 
UF English professor Mary 
Robison also has a book featured on Winfrey’s list but could not be reached for comment. 
Her book, “One D.O.A, One on 
the Way,” was 18th on the list and is a story about a movie scout in post-Katrina New Orleans. UF PROFESSORS

July 19, 1969, was an ordinary 
Saturday. But the following day 
changed history.
It was 40 years ago Monday 
that Neil Armstrong first took his “giant leap for mankind,” and still people remember the Apollo 11 moonwalk mission.“To be able to look up in the 
night sky and know that, at that same moment, an ordinary man was looking back at Earth from the surface of the moon was a com-pletely unreal experience,” said Charles Telesco, a UF astronomy 
professor who watched coverage 
of the moonwalk from his Ohio apartment as a teenager.
Millions of people watched the moonwalk live as the grainy black-and-white images were beamed back to Earth and stored on giant reels of tape, according to a Fox-News.com report.
The original tapes have since 
been misplaced, but to celebrate 
the anniversary, NASA released 
restored footage of the mission Thursday that showed new details missing from first tapes, according to NASA’s Web site.
Telesco said the restored foot-
age consists of processed versions of transmitted images and that even though NASA worked hard to improve the degraded tapes, he is disappointed to know that the 
original videos may be lost for-
ever.
“The restored video is impor-
tant, but it is definitely not as his-toric as the original footage would have been,” said Telesco, who worked for NASA for 12 years be-ginning in the early 1980s.
The video montage shows 
highlights of the iconic moonwalk, including improved images of Commander Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin taking their first footsteps on the moon’s cratered surface and planting the American flag.
But Telesco said that the lost 
tapes don’t dampen the achieve-ment, especially knowing that 
scientists had very limited technol-
ogy.
“It was like shooting an ar-
row up into the sky and hitting the smallest target possible,” he said. “We did it fast, but we did it right.”
Anthony Gonzalez, an associate 
professor in the UF astronomy de-
partment, was not alive when Arm-
strong first announced, “the Eagle has landed,” but he said he hopes 
to see another astronaut return to 
the moon during his lifetime.
“Hopefully my lifetime will 
be a while,” Gonzalez said. “But I definitely expect someone to be back on the moon within the next decade or two.”
It has been 37 years since man last walked on the moon. Twelve astronauts from six Apollo mis-sions have successfully completed the journey, but nobody has re-turned to the lunar surface since Eugene Cernan in 1972, according to an article on CNN.com.
Gonzalez credits this to the re-
cent lack of motivation and com-petition from other countries, un-like in the ‘60s, when the U.S. was under pressure to put a man in space after the Soviet Union suc-cessfully sent Yuri Gagarin into or-bit in 1961. Gonzalez said America learned a lot from the competition 
with Russia.
“The space race led to tele-
communication satellites and had 
a huge impact on 
weather forecasts and GPS systems,” he said. “Most im-
portantly, it had a huge impact on the country psychologically.”
Jessica Gordon, a UF business 
freshman, said she believes the ad-vancement in technology has been one of the greatest benefits to come from the moonwalk exploration.
“It makes me wonder what is 
going to be accomplished during my lifetime,” she said.
Even with the current lull in 
moon travel, Gonzalez said the first moonwalk mission will al-ways be regarded as an iconic mo-
ment in history.
“It’s incredible to think that the 
U.S. was able to undertake such 
a tremendous endeavor in such a short period of time,” he said. “It just proves that America as a coun-try can accomplish anything it sets its mind to.”TUESDAY, JULY 21, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 9

Clothing, jewelry and spiritual connections were 
all up for grabs at Saturday’s psychic fair held at the 
Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of Gainesville.  
As about 150 onlookers wound their way around 
the white-walled worship center, bells chimed, crys-
tals swayed and a constant hum of intimate conver-sations filled the chapel.  
“It is a close-knit group of people here,” Bill Kel-
ley said.  
Kelley and his artistic wife, Bonnie Barnes-Kelley, 
have attended the fair for 10 years. Barnes-Kelley said she asks the Goddess to guide her hands and bless her stones while crafting her jewelry.
At the top of the stage, 11 tables were continu-
ously occupied with hopeful participants looking for intimate conversations with a psychic or a con-nection with a dead loved one.  
“When someone participates in a reading, it may 
not always be what’s going on here and now,” said event organizer the Rev. Marguerite Romeis. “You have to go to the readers without expectations.”
Besides readings, the fair also offered detox foot 
baths, ear candling, and aura photography. In ear candling, heat is used to clean ear canals and aura photographers take photos of human energy fields.  
Romeis said this fair has been slower than those 
in the past.  
“Even though we don’t have as many merchants 
today, things are going pretty well,” she said.
One exotic booth offered colorful clothing, bright 
jewelry and trinkets from Thailand and India.  
Merchant Sylvia Palacios has traveled to differ-
ent countries for several years studying various cul-tures and religions.  
Many of her pieces carry spiritual meanings, 
and she said some even serve as protection for the wearer.  
One, a white shell known as gomuk, carries a 
special meaning, Palacios said.
“It represents the eyes of Shiva,” she said, “who 
is the god of destruction.”
The event will continue to be held three times a 
year, Romeis said.  AROUND GAINESVILLEJewelry, art

� THE FIVE BILLBOARDS COST 
$28,000 ANUALLY.
By SIMON PERSICO
Alligator Contributing Writer
In rustic, muted tones, they beckon 
weary travelers headed from Georgia 
to spend a night in Gainesville.
The five billboards, which line Inter-
state 75 southbound from the Georgia 
state line to Gainesville’s city limits, 
were commissioned by VisitGaines-ville, a government agency founded in 1990 designed to increase tourism in the region. However, several hotel 
managers have found no business in-
crease since the boards’ placement.
The ads target weary travelers, of-
ten on their way to destinations deep-
er in Florida such as Naples, Sanibel or Miami, said Roland Loog, executive 
director of VisitGainesville. 
VisitGainesville is funded by a 3 
percent hotel room tax, and the bill-boards cost a total of $28,000 annually, Loog said. By placing signs far outside 
of Alachua, VisitGainesville hopes to 
lure lodgers and their money away 
from nearby Marion and Columbia counties.
“We don’t usually do 
billboards, but this year 
our walk-in industry took a huge hit, ” Loog said, referring to business gained from passing travelers. 
Local artist Jim Harrison was 
commissioned by the organization to design the billboards, each tout-ing Gainesville’s thousands of hotel rooms. The boards  reflect Harrison’s 
signature vintage fruit-crate label 
style. According to Loog, motels and 
lodging directly on the interstate are 
expected to see the greatest increase in 
customers. 
Currently, the Alachua County 
Hospitality Council is preparing a re-
port on the effects of the billboards, 
but some Gainesville hoteliers are al-ready pessimistic. 
“No, I don’t think it will help,” said 
Mike Patel,  manager of America’s Best 
Value Inn. “They come because of our 
own advertising”. 
Of the four hotel managers inter-
viewed, none reported an increase 
in walk-in guests, and two were not 
aware the campaign existed. 
“We haven’t had any more guests 
than usual, but that’s just how the summers go,” said Katie Johns-Hupp, 
a representative of the Sweetwater 
Branch Inn added. Gville billboard ads may not help sales“Even though we don’t have as many mer -
chants today, things are going pretty well.”

BEIJING — They fled in droves, 
terrified by rumors of a radiation leak, 
with many jumping empty-handed into motorcycle taxis and farm trucks they hoped would take them out of 
harm’s way.
While most of the residents of 
Henan province’s Qi county had re-
turned by Monday amid government assurances it was safe, last week’s mass exodus — some residents estimated that hundreds of thousands of people left — illustrates how quickly rumors can spread and cause alarm in China.
The unease was sparked Friday, 
when bystanders saw government workers at a factory using robots to ex-amine a malfunctioning cobalt-60 irra-diator. The machine is used mainly for sterilizing pepper powder, flavoring used in instant noodles and garlic.
Within hours, alarm spread as peo-
ple began hearing word that explosions 
occurred at the irradiation plant.
“There was chaos on the streets from about 2:30 p.m. until dark,” said 
Zhu Zhihai, manager of a garlic-pro-cessing factory where all 30 employees rushed away. “All kinds of vehicles were going out of the county — farm vehicles, motorcycles and cars. People were in a hurry, and they didn’t take anything with them.”
Zhu, who esti-
mated that about a third of the county’s 1 million people fled, said 
he didn’t leave because his friends at the local environmental protection bureau told him there had not been a disaster.
An official at the Qi county govern-
ment office said only “a small portion of people left” and refused to give his 
name or any other details.
Rumors can run rife in China, where 
many do not trust local officials and the 
government-controlled media because they downplay or in some cases boy-cott negative news fearing it will trig-ger social unrest.TUESDAY, JULY 21, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 11

Florida’s freshwater turtles has begun.
It also prohibits the collection of 
turtle eggs. However, individuals will 
be permitted to take one turtle a day 
from the wild for most species.
The measure is considered the 
toughest rule on harvesting freshwa-ter turtles in the nation and is a misde-meanor with fines ranging from $250 for a first violation to up to $750. Crit-ics said the ban goes too far and gives turtles too much protection.
State spokeswoman Pat Behnke 
disagrees.
“We have some of the most pre-cious and unique and abundant spe-cies in Florida, and anytime you’re taking measures to conserve them, you’re not going too far,” Behnke said 
Monday.
Scientists were concerned the con-
tinued harvest of turtles at such a 
heavy rate would threaten their sur-vival.
The Florida Fish and Wildlife Con-
servation Commission approved the restrictions to protect more than two dozen species. Because worldwide de-
mand for turtles has grown so much, a 
lot of hunters turned to Florida to get their supply.
Turtle meat is considered a delicacy 
in Asian markets, and the shell is used in traditional Chinese medicine.

UF President Bernie Machen’s trip to In-
donesia later this month is still on the sched-
ule despite Friday’s attacks at two luxury hotels in the country’s capital of Jakarta.
Eight people died and more than 50 were 
injured, including eight Americans, in the suicide bomb attacks at the JW Marriott and the Ritz-Carlton hotels, according to The New York Times, but it is unclear who is be-hind the attacks.
Machen and a delegation of officials from 
U.S. universities and colleges are scheduled to visit a handful of Indonesian cities, in-cluding the capital Jakarta, from Sunday to Aug. 1.
“We’re monitoring the situation and 
waiting to hear from the organization plan-ning the trip,” UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes said Friday.Terance Bigalke, director of education at 
the East-West Center, which organized the trip, said the trip will happen as planned, though one university official has dropped out.
He said the official’s decision likely had 
something to do with Friday’s attacks.
But officials from two 
other universities recently requested to be included in the delegation, he said.
Hotel arrangements 
are being made by the Indonesian government, and delegation members wouldn’t stay at Ameri-
can hotels, he said. No lodging arrange-
ments have been changed as a result of the 
attacks.
About 20 universities, university systems 
and colleges in the United States will be rep-
resented on the trip.UF ADMINISTRATIONMachen trip still scheduled

Machen declined to comment on the meeting 
in an e-mail, but UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes 
issued this statement about the meeting: “We’re optimistic our concerns will be addressed by the 
city of Jacksonville, and we’re waiting to hear 
from Mayor Peyton.”
Lowe also declined to discuss specifics, say-
ing she can’t yet reveal which of Machen’s 
changes the Landing might put in place.
“We’ll sit down with the city 
now and figure out what’s best with everybody,” she said.
She said she let Machen know the Landing 
already takes safety very seriously and has en-acted many new security measures in the past few years, which a spokeswoman said in an in-terview earlier this month cost the Landing an additional $50,000 a year.
The spokeswoman also said implement-
ing some of the changes, like limiting crowds, would be difficult, and others would impact the 
revenues of businesses at the venue.
Tonight, student senators will likely vote on 
a resolution that condemns Machen’s attempts 
to restrict legal drinking in Jacksonville during the game.UF ‘optimistic’ 
about Oct. game“There are some things you need to 
know about UF that they will never tell 
you on your visit,” the e-mail said. “It has gone to hell in a hurry and is in a classic death spiral.”
In one section, Kone allegedly took 
on top administrators one by one in a list titled “THE WINNING TEAM.”
The e-mail calls one administrator 
an “Uncooperative prima dona,” de-scribes another as “So hyper, he vibrates” and “an imbecile” and says of another: “Needs lithium. Has built nothing.”
Many of the insults in the e-mails 
and letter are directed at Machen. At one point, Machen  is called the worst presi-dent in UF’s history and is described as “among the top 10 most arrogant people on the planet.”
Kone himself is also mentioned sev-
eral times. 
“The Kone execution was about the 
ugliest political assassination in the his-
tory of academic medicine and started 
the mass exodus of talent (what little there was) from the college of medicine,” it read.
While at UF, he filed 12 complaints 
and made thousands of pages of records requests.
Kone agreed to drop all complaints he 
filed with UF and stop making public re-
cords requests as part of the settlement.
After investigating the complaints, UF 
found most of them to have no merit, ac-cording to university documents.
“A primary purpose of this Agree-ment is to cease all disputes and adverse 
interactions of the Parties, which have been extraordinarily time-consuming and distracting,” the settlement reads.
Kone has agreed not to seek future 
employment with UF or its affiliates.
UF also agreed not to make any com-
ments about the matter save for nine 
statements.
“Dr. Kone acknowl-
edges that his concerns with the university have been resolved and that he is satisfied with the University’s 
response to complaints 
he had made,” one 
statement reads.
Another statement, dealing with 
Kone’s payout, explains that it is just over a year’s worth of total compensation and states that UF would have spent as much or more if the disputes between UF and Kone had continued and resulted in liti-
gation.
Kone was paid a salary of $525,000 
when he was dean and about $418,000 
afterward, when he was a professor, ac-cording to UF records.
UF has also agreed to send potential 
employers a pre-written reference letter signed by the university president at the time.
The letter does not mention any of the 
controversies Kone was involved in.
Kone is now employed at the The Uni-
versity of Texas Medical School at Hous-ton, his previous employer, as a visiting professor. He will be paid about $251,000 this year, according to the school’s hu-man resources department.
But Kone’s impact on UF isn’t over.In an investigation into one of his 
complaints, the results of which were released Monday, UF determined that 
some hiring practices have violated the 
spirit of a memo sent out in September 2005. The memo prohibits UF from re-hiring employees who have entered the state’s Deferred Retirement Option Pro-gram (DROP) before they have officially retired.
Under the DROP program, employ-
ees can retire in order to collect retire-
ment checks but must wait a month 
before they can be re-hired, though the state Legislature changed that period to six months this year.
The investigation found that, out of 
five employees who were reviewed, two  were offered jobs at UF again before they had officially retired. One employee would have been invited back, but the of-
fer was rescinded. 
None of the cases involved a breach of 
state law, the investigation concluded.
Nevertheless, Paula Fussell, UF’s in-
terim vice president of Human Resource 
Services, said UF is looking to put a new policy in place requiring a review of all cases in which UF is considering re-hir-ing an employee in DROP.
Fussell said that as of February, about 
20 UF employees in the program had been re-hired and were potentially eligi-ble to receive a regular paycheck in addi-tion to a retirement paycheck, known as “double-dipping.”
Kone denied writing e-mails that led to his dismissal

Former Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Vick (left) arrives at federal court with his attorney Larry Woodward in Norfolk, 
Va., on Monday. Vick ended the home confinement portion of his federal sentence Monday.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
HAMPTON, Va. — Suspended NFL star Mi-
chael Vick ended his federal dogfighting sen-
tence Monday, freeing him to lobby for a return to the field.
Vick’s attorney Lawrence Woodward told 
The Associated Press outside Vick’s suburban Virginia home that the former Atlanta Falcons quarterback had been released from federal cus-tody as scheduled. That means Vick no longer has to wear the electronic monitor he’s had while under home confinement for the last two months of his 23-month sentence.
Shortly before Woodward came out of the 
house, two men in a government car with a U.S. 
Probation Services folder on the dashboard paid a brief visit to the home. They carried a large case similar to the one that Vick’s 
ankle monitor was delivered in when he started home confinement. The men declined to identify themselves or speak to waiting reporters.
Vick then drove to the federal courthouse in 
nearby Norfolk to meet federal probation offi-cials to take care of paperwork. Vick declined to answer reporters’ questions as he left the court-house with Woodward about an hour and 45 minutes later. Vick hopes to soon meet with NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, who has said he would review Vick’s status after Vick completed his sentence.Vick wraps up

We’ve looked back. Now, it’s 
time to take a peek forward.
Over the last three weeks, 
we unveiled our alligatorSports Top 10 UF Athletes of 2008-09, counting down from No. 10 to No. 1.
We were praised and vilified. We 
would have it no other way.
Now, I’d like to introduce one final 
list to push through the summer dol-drums, and take a look at some of the most intriguing questions that will be 
answered during the next nine months 
in Gainesville.
Starting Thursday, we will reveal 
what we think are the Top 10 Burning 
Questions for UF Athletics in 2009-10.
Once again, we went through a nomi-nation process and 
had our six-colum-nist panel select 
and rate their list. 
The ballots were 
tallied.
And of course, 
we welcome any 
feedback. E-mail us at sports@alligator.
org or find us on Twitter at twitter.com/alligatorSports. 
We might publish it or read it on the 
alligatorSports Podcast, which you can check out on iTunes.
But back to our upcoming roll call of 
the most important topics of the quickly approaching new school year.Coming up: Top Burning QuestionsThere’s a thin line between admi-
ration and objectification. 
That line was crossed a long 
time ago. It just took a disgusting in-vasion of privacy to make the sports world realize how far past the line we were. 
Thursday, a video recorded through 
a peephole showing UF alum and ESPN reporter Erin Andrews naked in her hotel room was posted on the Internet. By Friday afternoon, popu-lar sports blogs had all picked up on and written about the video. As things tend to do online, the video went viral and spread rapidly even after it was removed from the original location. 
Andrews’ attorney, Marshall B. 
Grossman of Bingham McCutchen LLP, issued the following statement Friday:
“While alone in the privacy of her 
hotel room, Erin Andrews was sur-reptitiously videotaped without her knowledge or consent. She was the victim of a crime and is taking ac-tion to protect herself and help ensure that others are not simi-larly violated in the future. 
Although the perpetrator or perpetra-tors of this criminal act have not yet been identified, when they are identi-fied she intends to bring both civil and criminal charges against them and against anyone who has published the material. We request respect of Erin’s privacy at this time, while she and her representatives are working with the authorities.”
ESPN released a similar statement

BRISBANE, Australia — Hit a 
few loose shots or three-putt the first 
green at Nullarbor Links and you’ll have plenty of time to think about 
your errant ways before teeing off at the second.
That’s because No. 2 is 42 miles 
down the highway.
Billed as the world’s longest golf 
course, Nullarbor is set to open next month — an 842-mile trek through 
the desolate Outback of Australia’s Nullarbor Plains, starting at Ceduna 
in the state of South Australia and finishing at the mining town of Ka-
lgoorlie in Western Australia.
The course is a novelty, for sure, 
but its organizers reckon the par 71, 
which includes holes borrowed from 
existing golf courses and others built 
from scratch near motels and tourist attractions, is sure to bring out the 
adventurous player.
“I don’t think there is any two 
ways about it, it will be unique,” Alf 
Caputo, the course’s project man-ager, said in a telephone interview 
from the western city of Perth, where he is organizing the finishing touch-
es on the course for a planned Aug. 15 opening. “The scenery along this 
stretch of the Eyre Highway is un-like anywhere else in the world.”
Same goes for the golf course. 
The seven holes taken from existing golf courses include some with sand 
greens that are raked, oiled and then 
rolled to maintain their smoothness.
The first two holes are among 
them, and they have natural grass fairways, but the 11 holes that are 
being built for Nullarbor Links will 
have synthetic tees and synthetic 
greens — the most workable plan 
from a maintenance standpoint due 
to the lack of rainfall in the flat, dry 
land of south-central Australia.
“In between the tees and green, we’ll leave it as natural terrain, al-
though we’ll clear the debris,” said 
Caputo, a former local council mem-
ber. “We’ll leave trees and natural 
hazards there, because we don’t 
want to do anything to affect the 
beautiful scenery.”
The cost of the course came in 
at a relatively reasonable $640,000, with about a third of the funding coming in a grant from an Austra-
lian government department which promotes tourism.
“It sounds like a bit of a pipe 
dream, but when we checked it all out, it was so basic,” Caputo said. “It doesn’t involve any million-dollar spending. We had the infrastructure 
at some of the holes already, and we’ll pass along proceeds from the 
green fees to the roadhouses and motels to ensure that maintenance is 
kept up.”
When the course opens, green fees will be a modest $40. A cer-
tificate will be issued from tourism 
centers at Ceduna in the east and 
Kalgoorlie in the west to those who 
have their scorecards stamped for 
all 18 holes.
Bob Bongiorno, a former road-
house/motel manager at Balla-donia, which will host one of the 
holes, came up with the idea for the 
course.
“I first 
thought about it nine or 10 years ago,” 
Bongiorno told the AP from Kal-
goorlie. “I had lived on the Nullar-bor for 10 years, and I always felt 
that people just connected east and west along our highway, and tra-
versed the distance quickly.
“They endured rather than en-
joyed the trek. They missed what 
I called a lot of the ‘self-find’ stuff along the way. The whole idea was 
to try to create something to slow 
people down and make it part of the 
holiday.”
So far, so good in that depart-
ment. The golf course’s Web site had 
more than 15,000 hits in the three 
days after word of it first appeared in local media.
The idea took shape when Capu-
to and Bongiorno, now good friends, sat in a bar and brainstormed “over a glass or two of red wine,” Caputo 
said. “All good ideas come out of a glass of red, don’t they?” Out of that 
session came the setup of the course and the thought of working with lo-cal motels and tourist attractions.
Caputo said the average group 
of golfers will take about four days to complete the course, which, at its most eastern point at Ceduna is 
1,300 miles west of Sydney. More than 250,000 tourists annually make the trip across the hot, arid Nul-
larbor on the Eyre Highway, and 
there soon could be more: Caputo 
says a British travel promoter wants 
to put together a 10-day package 
which includes Nullarbor Links and 
top-flight courses in Adelaide and 
Perth.
Included on the Nullarbor jour-
ney is the longest stretch of straight 
road on any highway in Australia. 
After golfers leave the par-4, 340-yard hole at the Caiguna roadhouse, 
they won’t have to turn their steer-ing wheels for 90 miles.
When they arrive at the next hole 
at the Balladonia Motel, they can 
take a side trip to an area commem-
orating the July 1979 fall to earth of the NASA research laboratory Sky-
lab, which landed in fiery chunks around Balladonia. 
U.S. President Jimmy Carter 
is said by locals to have phoned 
the motel’s manager to apologize, 
and the area’s shire ranger, David Somerville, was photographed giv-
ing a NASA official a littering ticket, 
which the council later waived.
The next hole is a par-3, 155-yard-
er at the Fraser Range — home of the 
largest eucalyptus hardwood forest in Australia, some trees more than 
100 feet tall. There’s also a working 
sheep station nearby.
Since the holes are designed to 
be played from either direction, they are not numbered. 
So the hole at Caiguna near the 
long stretch of road is called Ninety 
Mile Straight, followed by Skylab, 
and then Sheep’s Back.
And don’t forget Caputo’s and 
Bongiorno’s favorite hole — the 
19th.
“We’ve got a great bar at either 
end in Ceduna or Kalgoorlie, but the beauty of this course is that every 
hole has a 19th hole,” says Caputo, 
laughing. “Some just steps from the 
green. How good is that?”TUESDAY, JULY 21, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 23
World’s longest golf course opening in Australia
Saturday, saying that Andrews had been 
“grievously wronged” by “this abhorrent act.”
While everyone in their right mind real-
izes the perversion and horrible invasion of privacy involved in recording the video, it’s not an isolated incident. 
For sports blogs and news outlets alike, 
Andrews equals instant page views. No mat-
ter how mundane the topic, she brings read-
ers to the site. 
That’s even true for us at the Alligator. 
A March 21, 2008, story about a speech An-drews gave at UF is still among the most-
viewed stories on our site. As much as I’d 
like to think that’s because readers were in-
terested in the story, we all know that’s not 
true. It’s because of the corresponding photo 
of Andrews.
The popular sports blogs are largely be-
ing targeted as the villains in this case for promoting and encouraging this unreason-
able fan adoration. While I don’t think blogs 
are nearly the scourge on society many tra-
ditional journalists make them out to be, I agree in this case. 
To defend their actions, many of the blogs 
have argued that their coverage of Andrews 
was tongue-in-cheek and that they only pro-
vided coverage of America’s “Sideline Prin-cess” in an ironic manner that their readers would appreciate. 
While I can’t claim to know the motives 
of each blog’s editor, I do know that every joke of this kind begins with some element of truth. Andrews brought page views, and even if blogs were continually posting sto-ries as a joke, they still reaped the benefits and fed into the somewhat creepy love fans have for her. The reasoning behind it doesn’t matter in this case, because they gave the readers what they wanted to see: more Erin Andrews.
But the problem came, as we saw this 
weekend, when they saw all of Erin An-drews.
The joke, such as it was, has gone too far. 
It’s not funny anymore. It’s offensive.
By this point, the bloggers seem to be 
honestly remorseful for what Andrews is go-
ing through, but they have also realized that 
they created something they can’t undo.
When stories about the video started to 
appear online, comments online ranged from 
enthused to outraged. Perhaps the most dis-gusting reaction, however, comes from those who joke that Andrews should not be upset about the video because she is physically flawless, as if the only problem with this incident is that Andrews was filmed while nude. 
But that’s not the real problem. It’s just 
the culmination of months of fan worship and an online culture that promotes this type of obsessive behavior.We tried to look at it like this

Phoenix guard Steve Nash, shown here on March 8, 2009, agreed 
to a two-year, $22 million contract extension with the Suns.
■ THE DEAL IS WORTH $22 
MILLION OVER TWO YEARS.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
PHOENIX — Steve Nash and 
the Phoenix Suns have agreed on 
a two-year, $22 million contract extension, his agent said.
Bill Duffy confirmed the agree-
ment Monday in an interview with The Associated Press.
The deal will keep the two-time 
MVP point guard under contract with the Suns through the 2011-12 season.
The 35-year-old Nash, entering 
his 13th NBA season, had one year left on his contract that would pay him $13 million next season.
The agreement first was report-
ed by ESPN.
The Suns and Nash had been 
in negotiations for several weeks on a deal that would keep him in Phoenix. He will be 38 when the 
contract expires. He is expected 
to sign the agreement later this week.
Under the agreement, $6 mil-
lion of the final two years of the contract will be deferred, with $3 million being paid in each of the two years following the expiration of the contract, Duffy said.
The deal was pushed closer to 
completion last Wednesday when owner Robert Sarver met with Duffy in Las Vegas to sweeten the team’s earlier offer.
The Suns lured Nash to Phoe-
nix in 2004 in a celebrated effort 
that included a flight to Dallas by 
then-owner Jerry Colangelo and a host of representatives of the team. When Mavericks owner Mark Cu-
ban balked at re-signing Nash, at 
age 30, at the amount he wanted, the point guard signed a five-year, $65 million contract with Phoenix.
What followed were the best 
years of Nash’s career as the mae-stro of the high-octane offense of 
then-coach Mike D’Antoni. He was 
named the league’s 
MVP in 2005 and 
2006 and was a first-team all-NBA selection in 2005, 2006 and 2007.
When D’Antoni left the Suns 
for the New York Knicks after the 2007-08 season, Nash struggled with the slower style of new coach Terry Porter. 
When Porter was fired at the 
All-Star break and replaced by as-sistant Alvin Gentry, the Suns re-turned to the speed game, a factor that no doubt figured into Nash’s 
decision to re-sign.
When Gentry was kept on as 
coach after the season, Nash made 
his feelings known on his Twitter 
account.
“Really happy that the Suns re-signed Alvin Gentry,” Nash wrote. 
“Great coach and great person.”
Nash will stay with a team 
that faces an uncertain future af-ter failing to make the playoffs for 
the first time since he rejoined the 
team. 
All-Star Amar’e Stoudemire 
has one year left on his contract 
and wants the maximum in any 
new deal, something the budget-conscious Suns may not be willing to do.
Nash had to be convinced the 
team was willing to take steps to become a contender again, Duffy said. 
He said the team has assured 
Nash he will be consulted as the Suns make future moves, the agent said.
If Stoudemire does leave, the 
Suns will have the money to be a 
player in the lucrative free-agent 
market after the coming season.
Nash, born in South Africa 
and raised in Victoria, British Co-
lumbia, was the Suns’ first-round 
draft pick in 1996 and was traded to Dallas in 1998. He has averaged 14.4 points and eight assists in his pro career.
In the last five years with 
Phoenix, Nash has averaged 17.1 points and 10.8 assists per game. He has shot better than 50 percent 
from the field and 43 percent from 
3-point range in all five seasons.Nash, Suns agree to extension
