CHANDLER, Ariz. (AP) — An 18-year-old 
high school student caught with his 48-year-
old math teacher in her bedroom was stabbed to death by her boyfriend, who was himself a former student of hers, police said Tuesday.
Chandler police said 20-year-old Sixto Bal-
buena told them he never meant to kill Samuel Valdivia. 
He allegedly told police “the blade went in 
like going into butter” and that he just wanted to show Valdivia how much he hurt him by sleeping with Tamara Hofmann.
Balbuena, a Navy sailor on leave from Cal-
ifornia, was arrested on a charge of second-degree murder after police found him covered in blood and told them about the killing.
 He remained jailed in lieu of $100,000 bond 
on Tuesday and did not yet have a lawyer.
Balbuena found his girlfriend naked and 
Valdivia in his boxer shorts in the woman’s bedroom around 2:40 a.m. Friday, according to police reports and court documents.Student killed in love triangle involving teacherMatt Tripp / Alligator

UF will be cracking down on spam e-mail 
and will begin allowing students to forward 
their university e-mail to outside accounts again in the coming weeks.
The changes are costing UF about  $300,000, 
according to Chuck Frazier, UF’s interim chief information officer. Most of the money is going toward new 
spam-filtering technologies, Frazier said. UF would have to shell out another $300,000 in two to three years if it continued using the same technologies, he said.
The cost estimates don’t account for staff 
labor, he said.
One reason UF had to stop allowing stu-
dents to forward their university e-mail to outside accounts was because the amount of spam coming from UF accounts caused some e-mail providers, such as AOL, to block UF e-mail, he said.
The policy that bans forwarding to outside accounts has been in effect since fall of 2005, according to Alligator archives.
Currently, about 2 million of the 3 million 
or more e-mails handled by WebMail every day are spam, Frazier said.
“A relatively small percentage of all the e-
mail is really legitimate e-mail,” he said.

sures, combined with improvements made by UF ADMINISTRATIONSystem sees anti-spam, forwarding changes

Every evening at 6:30, Crocs, Ske-
chers and flip-flops join the shoes pil-
ing on  a powder-blue porch where people shed them before stepping over the threshold onto the Krishna House’s  checkered temple floor.
The shoes belong to Krishnas, 
non-Krishna Hindus, UF students, 
Gainesville residents and out-of-
towners, who sit on gray and blue mats to worship, learn or just watch 
and listen as the Krishnas pray, 
chant, sing, dance, and discuss the Bhagavad Ghita, a sacred Hindu text.
The Krishna House is home to 
students who are in the 
Institute for Vaishnava 
Studies, which teaches Vaishnavism, one of the 
most prominent sects of 
Hinduism.
Andres Salim, a UF senior, lives in the blue Krishna House and learns 
alongside other students to live by four principles: cleanliness, auster-
ity, truthfulness and compassion. 
Salim, who was raised Catho-
lic, began eating Krishna lunch his freshman year and moved into the 
house after months of  learning from  teachers at the institute.Krishnas believe in one God and 
worship through Krishna, “the blue god,” as the supreme personality of 
God because of his all-attractive na-
ture.
Salim said that Krishna is inviting

UF administrators and student leaders spoke about preserving 
quality in the midst of sweeping budget cuts Tuesday.
The symposium, “University in Crisis,” highlighted the effects 
of the economic downturn on UF.  About 70 people attended the 
five-speaker panel.
The presenters included UF Provost Joe Glov-
er, UF professor and economist David Denslow, Student Body President-elect Jordan Johnson, along with Alligator editor in chief Nicole Safker and managing editor Kristin Bjornsen.
Glover, who spoke first, said UF had to cut  
$69 million from its budget last year, adding UF administrators predict budget cuts to fall be-tween $30 million and $90 million for the next 
academic year, depending on a compromise 
that must be forged between the Florida Senate and House, Glover 
said.
While the Senate has been willing to include various revenue 
increases such as the new cigarette tax, the House has been more reluctant, and both are looking at Obama’s stimulus money differ-ently.  All of the university’s individual college’s budget proposals will be  released Thursday in  a compilation that  will be made ac-cessible on UF President Bernie Machen’s Web site.
When asked about Machen’s involvement in the Capitol, Glov-Panel discusses

MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) — 
Parents, school districts and law 
enforcement have been grappling with what to do with teenagers who take sexually explicit pho-
tos of themselves with their cell 
phone cameras and send them to friends.
Vermont legislators are mov-
ing to get rid of one option: child pornography counts that result in lifetime listings on the state’s Internet sex offender registry.
Legislation passed by the Ver-
mont Senate and pending in the House would remove the most serious legal consequences for teenagers who engage in “sex-ting.” The bill would carve out an exemption from prosecution for child pornography for 13- to 18-year-olds on either the send-ing or receiving end of sexting 
messages, so long as the sender 
voluntarily transmits an image of himself or herself.
The bill, however, would not 
legalize the conduct. Legislators believe prosecutors could still use laws against lewd and las-civious conduct and against dis-seminating indecent materials to 
a minor.
State legislatures, including 
Vermont’s, have been cracking 
down on sexual predators in re-cent years, but lawmakers here say they don’t want increasingly tough penalties applied to those caught up in what many regard as a youthful fad.Santa Fe Film Society

Ex-Ill. Gov. Rod Blagojevich 
pleads not guilty
CHICAGO (AP) — Ousted 
Gov. Rod Blagojevich pleaded 
not guilty to racketeering and fraud charges Tuesday, defi-antly embarking on a long jour-
ney to clear his name but facing 
serious money problems and without a team of lawyers in place.
“I’m glad this process has 
finally begun,” the impeached former governor told the me-dia throng that spilled into the street in front of the courthouse 
after he and his brother, Robert, 
were arraigned on corruption charges.
Blagojevich, 52, is charged 
with scheming to sell Presi-dent Barack Obama’s former U.S. Senate seat, attempting to extort campaign money from companies seeking state busi-
ness and plotting to use the 
financial muscle of the gover-nor’s office to pressure the Chi-cago Tribune to fire editorial writers calling for his impeach-ment. The accusations led to his ouster as governor.WHAT’S HAPPENINGMemorial for Thad Owens

After an asbestos scare forced its closure 
on Friday, Santa Fe College’s Health Sciences 
Building W reopened Tuesday after testing.
Air and dust samples collected in the build-
ing contained no asbestos according to test results received on Monday night, said SFC spokesman Larry Keen.“Our main priority in this case is the safety 
and welfare of our students and faculty,” he said. “We are certainly pleased with the re-sults.”
Asbestos, a fibrous mineral, is commonly 
used for insulation and fire proofing, accord-ing to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Web site. When asbestos is damaged or disturbed, the fibers may become airborne, causing diseases such as lung cancer if inhaled, according to the site.While replacing the floor tiles in several 
rooms, crews became concerned that there was asbestos in the tile adhesive used during the building’s construction in 1984.
The tile adhesive had blackened, a sign that 
it could have contained asbestos, Keen said.
The building was closed at about 1 p.m. 
Friday, and classes were canceled until the 
building reopened. The test, which cost SFC 
$15,000, was performed by EMSL Analytical, Inc. SFC is still in the process of replacing the tiles, according to a release.
In recent years, campus-wide asbestos tests 
have found no traces of asbestos, Keen said.� UPD HAS NO LEADS AS OF

A man inappropriately touched 
three female UF students on campus 
Monday after claiming he was try-ing to remove a bug off each of their 
bodies, according to the University 
Police Department.The first two incidents occurred 
on the Reitz Union North Lawn be-tween 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. The third 
occurred at about 5:15 p.m. near the 
Fine Arts C building.
The suspect is described as a 20- 
to 30-year-old Middle Eastern man with a thick accent who is between 5 feet 3 inches and 5 feet 8 inches tall.
Each time, he targeted white fe-
males between the ages of 18 and 22.
In the third incident, he ap-
proached the woman at the Fine Arts C building, frantically telling her she had a large bug on her back, according to a UPD news release.
While brushing her back, he told 
the woman the bug crawled under her shirt. He then lifted her shirt and 
placed his hand on her back. 
Next, he told the 
woman the bug had 
crawled down her pants and tried to reach into her pants, at which 
point the woman pulled away and 
told him to stop touching her. He then tried to hug her before walking away toward the center of campus, the release stated.
UPD Lt. Darren Baxley said the 
other two women reported similar stories.
The suspect, who is believed to 
have dark hair and a dark complex-ion, was reportedly wearing khaki shorts or pants, a burnt-orange shirt and may have had metal-framed eyeglasses.
Baxley said UPD had no leads 
as of Tuesday morning. He said it’s possible other women have been assaulted as well, but have not re-ported it yet.
“I think, based on my experience, 
that typically when we get a spree pattern like this, there will be more victims that we don’t know about,” he said.
Baxley said UPD plans to charge 
the culprit with battery for all three incidents.
He asked anyone with informa-
tion about the alleged crimes to con-tact UPD at 392-1111.

A Gainesville High School student was ar-
rested early Tuesday morning after he drove 
his car into the State Attorney’s Office while 
high on marijuana.When Gainesville Police Officer Stephen 
Carter got to the office at 3:30 a.m., he found 
Jonathan Sweat’s gray Ford Ranger in the 
front window. 
According to the GPD arrest report, Sweat, 
18, appeared to be under the influence. Al-though he swayed while standing, slurred 
his words and staggered as he walked, Carter did not smell any alcohol on Sweat’s breath.
After failing three field sobriety tests, 
Carter arrested Sweat and took 
him to the police department.
Sweat told Carter that police 
wouldn’t be able to arrest him 
for DUI because he wasn’t drunk, he was 
high on marijuana, the report stated.After giving a urine sample, Sweat told of-
ficials he wanted medical attention and was taken to Shands at AGH. 
While at the hospital, Sweat refused to co-
operate with the medical staff. 
After being cleared by the hospital, he was 
taken to the Alachua County Jail.

Senators voted to approve 
the $569,602 academic budget 
for the 2009-2010, which will be dealt out to UF’s 24 different college councils. 
They presented, but did not 
vote on, the $582,513 organiza-tional budget that funds 87 UF student groups.
Senate will vote on that 
budget in a special meeting on Wednesday.   
The academic budget was 
approved following a special 
Senate meeting on Monday to 
discuss amendments. At Mon-day’s meeting, senators voted to take $7,613 from the special events co-sponsorship budget line in order to cover a deficit that came from 22 extra stu-dent organizations that joined SG’s budget cycle this year.
The majority of senators also 
voted against an amendment that would have, if passed, removed  $22,499 from the co-sponsorship budget line.
Under the proposal, the 
money would be given to Sen-ate’s Budget and Allocations Committee to help fund stu-
dent organizations.Orange and Blue Party Sen. 
Jonathan Ossip said this money 
would be better used to fund student organizations, which are the backbone of UF. 
But not all senators felt the 
same way.
“SGP and Accent are two of 
most prestigious organizations on campus,” said Gator Party 
Sen. Thomas Hilton. “They put 
on a bunch of shows and need their entire budget.”
Senators also added Gators 
for a Sustainable Campus back onto the budget cycle in Mon-day’s meeting. Later in the meeting, senators unanimously passed a resolution condemn-
ing acts of antisemitism. The 
resolution was written after a swastika was spray-painted on the side of Alpha Epsilon Pi, a traditionally Jewish fraternity. 
A five-page minority report 
was also submitted at Tues-day’s meeting by the Orange and Blue Party that discussed 
problems the party had with 
the budget committee. 
Sen. Alden Gillespy, who 
submitted the report, wrote that there were procedural is-sues when giving notice for hearings and inconsistent pol-icy within the meetings.SG approves more than $500K for academic budget

At UF, No. 15 usually stands 
for quarterback Tim Tebow, but 
for Bobby Moon, it’s the number of 
times he’s declared a major.
The now-economics sophomore 
still plans to graduate on time. 
Moon began college as a mathemat-ics major and went through physics, applied physiology and kinesiology, economics, philosophy, psychology, zoology, astronomy, aerospace en-gineering, food science and human 
nutrition, back to applied physiol-
ogy and kinesiology, biology, en-vironmental science, geology and finally economics again.
“It’s not that I didn’t like some-
thing about my majors,” he said. “I just always found something else that I liked better and wanted to try.”
The average UF student changes 
majors 1.5 times over his or her four years here, said Dr. Albert Matheny, director of the Academic Advising Center.
 “Fifteen is a lot of major chang-
es,” Matheny said. “It’s right up there with the most I’ve ever seen.”For Moon, the challenge was 
finding just one major to stick with.
“It’s not that I lack motivation, 
it’s just that I like too many things,” Moon said. Moon went to six differ-ent advisers to make the changes.
After several changes, an adviser 
finally suggested that he just change his major to “exploratory” so that he could sit in one major while looking 
into others.
“Exploratory felt like a waste,” 
Moon said. “I had all of the (prereq-
uisites) for everything, so I thought I might as well be something.”
Moon insists that he has finally 
found a major he is going to stick with.
“People are surprised that I say 
I am going to stick with economics because I say that every time with every major,” Moon said.
Because of Moon’s frequent 
changes, all of his schedules were 
created during drop/add week. 
“I’m a pro at ISIS-stalking,” 
Moon said. “I’m the best ISIS-stalker 
in the land.”UF sophomore decides on major after 15 attempts

FSU faces the prospect 
of making massive cuts
‘FML’ offers posters a chance to vent Twitter TerrorColumn
Quickly becoming as 
hipster-chic as a me-dium green tea fro-
yo from Pinkberry, Twitter’s emergence on the social net-
working scene offers users 
a fresh alternative from the likes of Facebook.
But like frequenting the 
L.A.-based chemical-laden dessert destination on a daily basis, overuse of Twitter’s ser-vices may also prove harmful for your health.
According to a study con-
ducted by the University of Southern California, Twitter’s constant updates, known as “tweets,” are too fast for the human brain to process. As a result, scientists are concerned young people will become in-different to a tweet informing 
the user about a tragic or up-
setting news story. 
Ultimately, if individu-
als rely too heavily on tweets for his or her source of news, evidence shows people may harm their moral compass.While humans are capable 
of responding to pain in a rapid fashion, they are unable to process admiration and compassion as quickly — a 
problem when mentally com-
prehending a constant stream of tweets on Twitter.
Fortunately for members 
of the Twitterverse, the study also looked at television news updates, which proved to be more harmful than receiving frequent tweets.
Speaking from personal 
experience, a few members of the Editorial Board have been known to get their daily tweet on from time to time, but they — shockingly — seem to be doing just fine.
Hell, on the long list of 
things we do that are detri-
mental to our health, exces-
sive tweeting has to fall some-where in between a lack of sleep and a diet relying far too heavily on rolls from Leo’s.
Tweet away.While budget woes at UF have students and faculty 
up in arms over a murky academic future, the fi-nancial situation at Florida State University teeters 
on the horrific.
Word out of Tallahassee reveals news of a proposal re-
leased on Monday by FSU administrators outlining deep budget cuts — which would go into effect under a worst-case scenario. Ranging from the elimination of 21 programs to the closure of a satellite campus in Panama City, FSU would also be forced to fire 350 faculty members under the plan.
According to an article in the Tallahassee Democrat, the 
proposal calls to cut areas of study including anthropology, German and oceanography, among others.  Additionally, oth-er programs will see reduced funding, restructuring or even 
be forced to merge.  
The overhaul of the university stems from decreased public 
funding from the state legislature for the upcoming fiscal year. 
Under the Senate budget, FSU stands to receive nearly $30 mil-lion less in 2009-2010 than the previous year. The figure jumps to nearly $80 million based on the current House budget.
The Editorial Board can’t help but feel downright awful for 
the entire Florida State community. While Gators and Semi-noles may be foes in the athletic arena, we both share the com-mon goal of developing individuals through higher education with hopes of making positive contributions in life. We sin-cerely hope there is a way for FSU to avoid a tenuous situa-tion that would alter the school’s otherwise seemingly bright future.
America’s resurgence will not take shape without the help 
of higher education.
It’s the biggest pity party on the Internet, and you’re all invited.
Fmylife.com is a blog where users anonymously 
post short messages containing “everyday anecdotes likely to happen to anyone.” These unfortunate events start with “Today” and end with “FML” — which, un-surprisingly, is an acronym for “f--- my life,” the phrase people have been muttering more and more frequently when something goes wrong.
I subscribe to the school of thought that something 
is funny until someone gets hurt, at which point it be-
comes hilarious. This may make me an awful person, 
but I can rest easy knowing that I’m not the only one 
who feels this way.
Fmylife.com has shot up to one of the top 100 Web 
sites visited in the English-speaking world — and it is 
schadenfreude at its best. Where else can you anony-
mously judge just how messed up other people’s lives 
are and laugh to your heart’s content at their misery?
It’s particularly uplifting when I’ve had a bad day. 
Going through the self-deprecating stories tells me I’m not alone. Nay, they tell me that somewhere out there, somebody’s life sucks way more than mine.
Some of the stories seem too good to be true — if 
“good” is the right word to use. Users can vote up a story by agreeing that the life of the person telling the story truly is f---ed or bury it by saying they deserved it. A competition of sorts has developed to see whose story fails the most miserably. Most of the posts are, I’m sure, stretches of the truth at best. That still doesn’t make the good ones any less funny.
That said, the FML trend has gone so far over the 
top lately. What started as a hilarious — albeit slightly facetious — way to waste time has evolved into a way for privileged kids to complain about trivial matters.
In the grand scheme of things, 
college kids probably don’t have much to complain about — but we couldn’t be any more melo-dramatic. Oversleeping and missing class is not FML-worthy. Neither is falling down some 
stairs (unless, of course, you manage to break both your clavicles on the way down). 
At least your girlfriend didn’t break up with you be-
cause you’re not enough like a sparkling vampire out of a novel.
Something truly worthy of a FML should be crafted 
with care. To properly construct a LOL-worthy story 
about how f---ed your life is can be a fine art. And some 
things just don’t make the FML cut.
The phrase “f--- my life” brings to mind abject misery 
and a pointlessness to go on, not how you’re supposed 
to feel after you realize that guy you’ve been trying to get to notice you says you smell like a grandma.
At least you haven’t fallen in love with a man online 
only to learn that “he” is really a 17-year-old girl from Chesterfield, Mo. — ouch.
What we can all take away from fmylife.com is not 
to simply pass judgment on how f---ed someone else’s life is but to realize that we all have pretty messed up days. 
And just when you think your day couldn’t get any 
worse, fmylife.com is right there to let you know it most certainly can.

‘Organic’ no guarantee of quality
Most people think that by buying “or-
ganic” they are guaranteed safer, healthier 
food. In reality, this food, which costs twice as much, may not be any better than normal food. 
The fundamentals of “organic” agricul-
ture are not quite the same as USDA organic labeling. Organic farming is based on sustain-ability, humane treatment of animals and be-ing ecologically conscious. However, to have “USDA certified organic” printed on the label only “means it is generally free of synthetic substances; contains no antibiotics and hor-mones; has not been irradiated or fertilized 
with sewage sludge; was raised without the 
use of most conventional pesticides; and con-tains no genetically modified ingredients.” 
There are no requirements for sustainable 
agriculture practices, no limitations on how far the products are shipped and definitely no mandates that the products need to be healthier than those produced using conven-tional agriculture methods. 
There are a few general benefits from or-
ganic foods, such as reduced pesticide use. Also, many of the food products appear healthier on the label than the traditional alternatives. However, organic food is not going to take care of America’s biggest food 
problem: obesity. Organic junk food is still 
junk food.
If you really want to help the organic 
movement, drive down to your local farmers market and you will undoubtedly find the fresh, healthy foods you want while support-ing your community. If you want to live a healthier life, try exercising regularly and cut-ting sugar from your diet. The USDA organic 
label is a marketing gimmick, nothing more.

4AGGM food products need to be labeled
While I agree with the heading of Amanda 
Sookdeo’s article from Tuesday’s letter to the 
editor, “GMOs represent technology of the 
future,” new technologies shouldn’t invali-
date good old American values.
Since its inception, America has experi-
enced unprecedented change primarily due 
to technological advances analogous to that 
of GMOs: From cars and color TVs to the In-
ternet and the iPhone. However, even in the 
wake of such enormous change, the funda-
mental rights our forefathers granted us have 
all but disappeared: The rights to vote, speak 
freely and even write opinion editorials. 
Why, then, are we suddenly being denied the 
right to know whether the food we eat has 
been genetically modified or not?
Opponents of genetically-modified-food labeling argue the added cost of differentiat-
ing between GM and non-GM foods is unnec-
essary. Sookdeo takes this argument a step 
further, suggesting people would view GM 
foods as “a harmful substance and not buy 
the product.” But since when is the profitabil-
ity of a biotechnology company of a higher 
priority than the freedom of choice?  
As Peter Phillips put it in his article, “A 
Survey of National Labeling Policies of GM 
Foods,” in the 2000 edition of The Journal 
of Agrobiotechnology Management and 
Economics, “There appears to be universal 
agreement that consumer choice needs to be 
enhanced through effective labeling, to allow 
consumers to choose between competing GM 
and GM-free food products.” Apparently 
we’ve missed the memo.

With war in the oil-producing overseas nations, 
soaring fuel prices, knowledge of immense en-
vironmental impacts of petroleum and coal and 
their finite supply, it’s apparent that an alternative energy 
source needs to be implemented.  
Many have been proposed, each with advantages and 
disadvantages. Nuclear energy has gained support due 
to its available technology and reliability, but the needed 
uranium has a finite supply and is polluting to extract. In addition, its hazardous byproduct has no storage solu-tion. Solar and wind energy are also good options, but 
they can be unreliable if the wind isn’t blowing or the sun 
isn’t shining. And because transportation is an issue, they 
are difficult to make available across our existing energy grid. This leaves us with one more alternative: biofuels.
In order for an alternative fuel to be viable, it must 
meet four criteria: be producible at sufficient quantities, show superior environmental benefits, be economically competitive and provide a net energy gain over produc-tion. Biofuel successfully addresses 
each of these.
Biofuel is the energy that is re-
covered from the chemical bonds 
formed during photosynthesis in living or once-living 
matter. Sources are not just corn or soybeans, but also in-
clude peat, forest products, agricultural residues, energy 
crops, animal and urban wastes and methane gas emitted 
from landfills.
The fact that biofuels pollute air and degrade land may 
be true, but only if improperly managed. Throughout the 
U.S., there are millions of hectares of land considered un-
suitable for food crop production that could be used for 
biomass crops, and with sustainable management, can be protected from further deforestation, degradation and soil erosion. Although the carbon dioxide emitted from burning biofuels is nearly equal to fossil fuels, the differ-ence is that the amount released burning biofuels is less than the amount taken up by its growth, leading to a net reduction.
Prices of biofuels reflect their current production, which 
is relatively low. Last week ethanol retailed at $1.78 per gallon while gasoline retailed for $1.96 per gallon. These prices will inevitably drop as production and demand in-creases, making biofuel even more competitive.
Because of advances in farming techniques, efficient us-
age of fertilizers and pesticides, higher yielding crops and more energy efficient conversion techniques, the amount of energy required to produce corn ethanol has signifi-cantly decreased. Currently, our retail-available ethanol 
is made from corn, and it provides us with an average of 
1 1/2 times more energy than is needed to produce it. But 
even more encouraging is the emerging technology of cel-lulosic ethanol that has the potential to provide 10 times more energy than is required for production.
The choice of biofuels is clearly the solution to replac-
ing our current failing energy sources.

Speaking OutBy THOMAS STEWART

At the other colleges Demetri 
Martin performs at, they have ban-
ners in their basketball arenas that read “Champions 1943.”
At UF, it’s a little different.“I come here, and it’s just a cal-
endar of every year ever,” Martin told the crowd of about 5,200 at the O’Connell Center Tuesday night as he pointed to the rafters.
Martin, who has contributed to 
“The Daily Show with Jon Stewart,” currently has a show on Comedy 
Central called “Important Things 
with Demetri Martin.”
Martin’s friend Adam Lowitt, a 
producer, comedian and 2002 UF grad, opened the show.
Lowitt began his act by making 
fun of the midtown bar BALLS.
“I have traveled all over the 
country, and this is the only town I’ve ever been to with a bar named BALLS.”
“You can type BALLS into Google 
Maps, and Gainesville pops up,” he said. “Even the guys at Google are like, ‘Fuck, Gainesville rules.’”
He also unfurled an enlarged 
copy of a menu for a Chinese restau-rant he ate at one day. The first item listed was Bull Penis for $5.50. He unrolled the menu further, revealing a large drawing of a woman with a sprawling octopus on her groin.
“I’m not sure if I want the noo-
dles or the bull penis,” he said, “as long as it’s not a woman being eaten out by an octopus.”
Martin then took the stage and charmed the crowd with his dead-pan one-liners, crude marker draw-ings and musical comedy.
He also had fun with the Ameri-
can Sign Language interpreter who was standing in front of the stage.
“How are you, sir that’s do-
ing the ASL?” he asked. The inter-preter continued signing. “I guess I should’ve said, ‘How am I,’” Mar-tin joked. Later in the show, Martin noticed the man signing the words “fuck you” during one of his jokes and began repeating it. The inter-preter, cracking a smile,  signed the 
words each time while the crowd 
erupted in laughter.
Martin said he’s been watching 
sports less and less lately and joked that he wished the mascots could play each other.
“I’d always rather see the actual animals fighting,” he said. “Like Colts versus Bears. Wizards versus Heat — fucking awesome,” he said.
“Magic versus Jazz… that’s a 
little too gay for me,” he said.
Martin also said he’s a fan of co-
conut soap. “It’s really cool, unless your hands are dirty from coco-nuts,” he said.
“I can’t tell how much progress 
I’m making in this situation,” he said, pretending to wash his hands.
Transitioning into the marker 
drawings portion of the show, Mar-tin flipped the page of his large sketch pad to reveal a picture of a 
crying baby with a funnel leading 
from its mouth to its ears.
“Oh wait, it’s going to me,” he 
pretended the baby would say. “Guess I better stop crying.”
Martin also questioned the safety 
of strobe lights.
“Strobe lights cause seizures 
in some people, but we still have 
them,” he said. “That’s crazy.”
“It’s like, look, I know these 
things give you seizures and make 
you swallow your tongue, but these guidos need to party.”
Moving over to the piano, Martin 
asked the production staff to give him a little mood lighting. They obliged, dimming the lights.
“I love to do virgin Jell-o shots,” 
Martin said after the lights were dimmed. “I guess what I’m saying is, I like to eat Jell-o really fast.”
“Thank god for cargo pants,” 
he continued. “’Cause sometimes I got some cargo I really wanna carry around on my thighs.”
Not wasting any time, Martin 
kept the one-liners flowing while playing the piano.
“Sleep tight, don’t let the bed 
bugs bite,” Martin said, “is a long way to say, ‘wash your sheets, you fucking slob.’”
“My friend’s superstitious.”
“Me, I’m just stitious. I got a reg-
ular amount of stish,” he said.
Accent Speaker’s Bureau spon-
sored Martin’s speech. He was paid 
$60,000 for the performance.8, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, APRIL 15, 2009

Step right up and enjoy your 
No. 15 minute of fame.
On Tuesday night, about 650 
people crowded Touchdown Ter-
race in Ben Hill Griffin Stadium in support of the second annual “First and 15” powder puff foot-
ball tournament draft event.
For a $5 entrance fee, guests 
clad in cocktail attire enjoyed 
food, a DJ and speeches given by 
Tim Tebow and Urban Meyer.
Varsity football players were 
auctioned off as coaches to 22 
organizations on campus, both Greek and non-Greek, that have 
created teams for the “First and 
15” powder puff tournament to be held Friday night.
Delta Delta Delta sorority was 
the first to choose, picking the Pouncey twins to be their coach-
es.
The championship game will 
be played in the Swamp immedi-
ately preceding the Orange and 
Blue Game on Saturday and will 
be filmed by ESPN.
The overall fundraising goal 
for the tournament, which is sponsored by Student Govern-
ment, totals about $250,000.
This money will 
go to Uncle Dick’s 
Home, an orphanage 
in the Philippines, as 
well as the Pediatric 
Oncology Unit at Shands Hospi-tal.
Food for the event was donat-
ed by 101 Cantina. Social Studies Promotions donated their time and a DJ to the event.
“I’ve never done much coach-
ing, but it’s a lot of fun, and we raise a lot of money that we know is going to a good cause,” said quarterback John Brantley, who coached the Zeta Tau Alpha so-
rority in last year’s tournament.WEDNESDAY, APRIL 15, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 9

NASA names treadmill after comedian Colbert
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
NEW YORK — One small step for NASA, 
one giant running leap for Stephen Colbert.
NASA announced Tuesday that it won’t 
name a room in the international space station 
after the comedian. Instead, it has named a treadmill after him.
NASA earlier held an online contest to 
name a room (or “node”) at the international space station. With write-in votes, the name “Colbert” beat out NASA’s four suggested options: Serenity, Legacy, Earthrise and Ven-ture.On Tuesday’s “The Colbert Report” on 
Comedy Central, astronaut Sunita Williams announced that NASA — which always main-
tained it had the right to choose an appropri-
ate name — would not name the node after Colbert.
Instead, Node 3 will henceforth be called 
Tranquility, the eighth most popular response submitted by respondents in the poll. The node’s name alludes to where Apollo 11 land-ed on the moon — the Sea of Tranquility.
NASA and Colbert compromised by nam-
ing a treadmill used for exercising in space af-ter Colbert. NASA, itself an acronym (National Aeronautics and Space Administration), often names things so they spell out something fun. 
And that’s what they did 
with the Combined Opera-
tional Load Bearing Exter-nal Resistance Treadmill (COLBERT).
Sophisticated tread-
mills are crucial for living in space for long periods of time, as astronauts do on the space station; they 
help keep astronauts fit and their bones from losing strength. Williams ran a marathon on one while living at the space station in 2007, jogging in place to coincide with the Boston Marathon.
The COLBERT treadmill is a new version 
that will be operational in August, NASA spokesman Mike Curie said.
“We don’t typically name U.S. space station 
hardware after living people and this is no ex-ception,” Bill Gerstenmaier, NASA’s associate administrator for space operations, said, add-ing: “We have invited Stephen to Florida for the launch of COLBERT and to Houston to try 
out a version of the treadmill that astronauts 
train on.”
Colbert
qualities that are pleasing to people.
Though the Krishnas represent 
only a part of Hinduism, people from 
all different lifestyles and religions 
participate in their classes, which are 
held mornings and evenings during 
the week, Salim said.
“That’s something that’s really cool 
about our society,” he said. “There’s no secrecy.”
There are fewer than 50 Interna-
tional Society for Krishna Conscious-
ness centers  in the United States, and 
two of them are in Alachua County: 
the Krishna House and a temple in 
Alachua, which is part of a Krishna 
community that expands across 127 acres. They are the only Hindu temples between Orlando and Jacksonville.
Some non-Krishna Hindus wor-
ship at the temples despite not iden-
tifying as Krishnas, and according to 
religion department chair Vasudha Narayanan, many Hindus do not 
consider themselves part of a specific 
sect.
Aside from worship, some fol-
lowers of Hinduism go to temples to socialize, and “one can be a perfectly good Hindu without ever going to a temple,” she said.
Diversity is a hallmark of Hindu-
ism, which recognizes hundreds of 
millions of gods and goddesses.
 In her book, Narayanan said that 
to be Hindu is to be engaged in a sense 
of pluralism and recognize the many gods as manifestations of the supreme being.
“There are many ways one can be 
Hindu. You can follow the traditions 
you feel most comfortable with,” she 
said. 
“Some speak about meditation and 
an inner journey, and others speak 
about social action. Others speak 
about devotion to the divine. There are many paths by which one can 
reach the supreme.”
The most prevalent concept in Hin-
duism is moshka, meaning liberation 
from the cycle of life and death, which Hindus believe is repeated endlessly until the soul achieves liberation, ac-
cording to a chapter Narayanan wrote 
for “The Illustrated Guide to World Religions.”
Dharma, which encompasses duty, 
truth, justic, law and righteousness, is also a universal concept in Hinduism.
Performing arts are celebrated in 
Hindu culture, and children often learn about Hinduism by immer-sion in traditional song and dance, 
Narayanan said .
“I think that’s the most important 
thing you can say about Hinduism 
here. In India, people learn Hinduism 
by being there—absorbing, observing 
and participating,” she said. “Here, you have to articulate what the reli-gion is about.” 
Nikita Kathuria, an active member 
of UF’s Hindu Students Council, was 
raised in a non-sectarian Hindu fam-
ily.
 She attends a non-sectarian Hindu 
temple in Orlando while she’s at home, 
and she and other Hindus she knows 
worship at the local Krishna temples while at UF, Kathuria said. 
“I do my prayers every day and try 
to go to the temple as much as I can,” 
she said. “We believe in Krishna, so 
the Hare Krishna temple is perfectly fine, too.”
It’s not difficult to maintain her 
faith at school, she said, because fol-lowers are free to choose their own methods of expressing and develop-
ing their spirituality without restric-
tive guidelines. 
“I feel like Hinduism is a very per-
sonalized religion,” she said. “You do what you can to best understand your-self.”10, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, APRIL 15, 2009

STOCKTON, Calif. — A woman kid-
napped, raped and murdered an 8-year-old 
girl and stuffed her body in a suitcase that was dumped in a pond just a few miles from home, prosecutors alleged Tuesday.
Melissa Huckaby, 28, was charged with 
murdering her daughter’s playmate, Sandra Cantu, in a gruesome crime that has shocked and terrified residents of Tracy, a Northern California city of about 78,000, 60 miles east of San Francisco. 
Huckaby, who volunteered as a Sunday 
school teacher at her grandfather’s Clover Road Baptist Church in Tracy, appeared in a San Joaquin County courtroom for her ar-raignment in a red jumpsuit and shackles. 
She trembled and cried as a judge read the 
charge: one count of murder with the special circumstances of rape with a foreign object, lewd or lascivious conduct with a child under 14 and murder in the course of a kidnapping.
The special circumstances mean Huckaby, 
if convicted, could face the death penalty or life in prison without the possibility of parole. District Attorney James Willett said Tuesday he has not decided whether to seek the death penalty.
During Tuesday’s hearing, which last-ed several minutes, public defender Ellen Schwarzenberg asked Judge Richard A. Vla-vianos for a gag order in the case. 
Vlavianos said that question would be an-
swered by his colleague, Judge Terrence Van Oss, who would be presiding over future hearings.
Vlavianos ordered Huckaby to return to 
court April 24, when she’s expected to enter a plea.
Crying mom arraigned on murder, rape charges
outside e-mail providers, should fix past problems, he said.
UF is currently testing the new system and should 
know when it will be launched in about a week or two, he said.
Frazier said a big reason for allowing forwarding 
again is so that students can take advantage of features that UF’s WebMail doesn’t offer, such as large amounts of storage space.
Frazier said UF also considered replacing WebMail 
with another system, like Google’s Gmail or MSN Hotmail, but ulti-mately couldn’t agree on a con-tract with any company.
There were issues over what happens with the ac-
counts when a student graduates and how long the e-mails are stored, among other things, he said.
At Santa Fe College, which switched to Gmail last 
year but still allows e-mail forwarding, the transition has gone smoothly, said Tim Nesler, associate vice president for information technology services. 
There is a slight concern, however, that Gmail might 
start charging fees in the future, he said.UF also considered 
replacing WebMail
er said the president often visits during 
the spring legislative session.
Glover attributed the overwhelm-
ing size of the undergraduate body as a main stress to UF’s budget woes.
“We do not have a large budget for 
the size of the student body,” Glover said. Each faculty position costs about $100,000, including salary and benefits. 
UF’s tuition is well below the nation-
al average, he said, adding solutions could include lowering the number of undergraduates. 
When asked about  FSU’s example 
of hiring freezes, Glover said UF will not be following suit.
“We don’t believe the university can 
afford to just stop,” Glover said. “We would lose ground and traction.” 
Denslow, professor and research 
economist, provided insight on the complexity of the university’s current crisis, and said quality undergraduate 
education must first be defined before 
it can be preserved. 
While some look to SAT scores of 
incoming frsehmen or graduate wages as a reflection of quality education, Denslow said quality starts in the class-room. 
Reducing UF’s student-faculty ratio 
of 22-to-1 to 20-to-1, he said, could help 
students in the long run.
“My guess is that the ones in a 
25-student class learn about 75 percent more,” he said.
Student Body President-elect Jordan 
Johnson said student involvement is es-
sential to protect programs from being 
cut, because he relays student feedback 
to administrators. 
When an audience member men-
tioned using part of Student Govern-ment’s $14 million budget as a possible source for university revenue, Johnson said it would be hypocritical for SG to exclude itself from proposed cuts.
“Student Government is definitely 
going to have to be ready to make con-cessions,” Johnson said.  
Alligator editors Safker and Bjorn-
sen spoke about  the issues raised in let-ters to the editor and columns featured in the Opinions section.  The newspaper has seen firsthand how students are re-acting, but to generate budget-cut solu-tions, managing editor Kristin Bjornsen 
said more discussion is needed.
“I don’t think we’re being creative 
enough,” she said. 
While students wandered about 
munching on free pizza after the event 
ended, many said they stopped by just to voice their concerns. 
For Jasmine Betz, a political science 
junior, the relationship between the 
university and the state legislature was 
reason for concern. 
“It’s extremely frustrating to watch 
the future of our university be decided by our state Legislature,” she said.“This is going to have catastrophic, exponen-tial repercussions.”Speakers stressed UF’s qualityDiverse group of people attends Krishna classes

When Kristina Hilberth was in-
volved in a head-on collision during 
her freshman year of high school, she was told that she could never play sports again. 
Both cars were totaled. Her neck 
and back were so severely injured that Hilberth, who played five sports in high school, was told that taking the softball field, stepping back onto the volleyball court and running track again would be impossible.
That wasn’t an option for her.“I was determined to come 
back,” Hilberth said. “I was like, ‘I gotta keep playing.’”
She made the best of her situa-
tion, attending physical therapy in an effort to return to full health and telling herself she had to keep play-ing. 
The following summer, she was 
back on the field. 
Despite the accident and a few 
setbacks early in her college career, Hilberth — now a senior and the starting catcher for the UF softball team — considers herself lucky for having the career that she’s had.
“I’m just grateful for what God’s 
given me and the opportunities that I’ve had, and I’m taking advantage 
of them,” she said. “I’m not going 
to look back and say I should have tried harder, I should have enjoyed it more, I should have worked harder. None of those things will be some-thing I’ll look back and regret.”
Her coaches and teammates de-
scribe her as the ideal player, the kind every squad must have, and 
as someone who does all the little 
things to improve herself and those around her.
“It’s just the spark she has for the 
game,” catcher Tiffany DeFelice said. “She really loves being out here. She loves the team. She loves what we do here day in and day out. It’s just her love for the game and her loving 
to be here that really gets her going 
every single day.” 
Once a walk-on freshman bur-
ied at the bottom of the depth chart, Hilberth has found success through hard work, determination and her ability to take full advantage of the opportunities she has been given.
Catching a Break
When Hilberth stepped on the 
field for her first fall practice at UF, she wasn’t in an enviable position: She was fifth on the depth chart.
“Of course you don’t want to 
be fifth-string catcher, but at least I wasn’t no-string catcher,” she said.
Hilberth, who didn’t officially de-
cide to play college softball until after her junior year of high school, took that attitude into the fall preseason. By December, she had worked her way up to No. 2 behind Kristen Butler, the Southeastern Conference 
Player of the Year in 2006.
Butler took Hilberth under her 
wing, teaching her the mechanics 
of catching in practice, pulling her aside after games and explaining why she made certain calls.“Even when she wasn’t playing, 
she’d pick up on little things from Kristen, and the improvement from when she came in to after that first year — then especially after the sec-ond year — was immense,” senior pitcher Stacey Nelson said.
Mary Ratliff, who played for UF 
from 2005 to 2008 and now serves as the student coach, said Hilberth probably worked harder than any-one on the team at the time, looking for ways to improve her game and see more time in the lineup.
While Hilberth waited behind 
Butler as the second-string catcher, she found other opportunities to 
work her way onto the field.
Coach Tim Walton, then in his 
first year at UF, liked her as a slap 
hitter, so Hilberth worked on im-proving that aspect of her game. She had to switch to the left side of the plate to become a slap hitter, but she was up to the challenge.
“When your coach has confi-
dence in your swing, that’s when you know you’re going to get more at-bats,” Hil-berth said. “So I knew that since he had more confidence in my slap, that’s what I needed to get better at.”
With that in mind, Hilberth fo-
cused on getting faster, running and 
jump-roping “all the time” during 
the summer between her sophomore and junior years. If she improved her speed, she would become a more ef-fective slap hitter, and the reward for becoming a reliable hitter would be more time in the field.
It may not have been the most 
direct path to playing time, but it 
was another example of Hilberth’s 
willingness to fill whatever role her coach and the team needed.
“She’s one of those people who 
never really cuts corners,” Ratliff said. “She just puts her nose to the grindstone and works hard at every-thing she does.”
Although her outstanding work 
ethic has not gone unnoticed by those around her, Hilberth’s con-sistent production as a hitter and catcher has been relatively unher-alded during her time at UF.
Away from the Limelight
Hilberth’s favorite player — for 
whom she wears her No. 31 jersey — is Mike Piazza, a former MLB catcher and a 12-time All-Star.
Piazza became Hilberth’s base-
ball idol when she was 6 years old and living in California. Hilberth and her parents attended a Los An-geles Dodgers game, Piazza’s first at Dodger Stadium. Fans mercilessly booed the rookie because of the con-troversy surrounding his draft selec-
tion and his personal connection to 
then-manager Tommy Lasorda.
“I was like, 
‘Mom, why are 
they booing him?’” Hilberth said. “I felt bad for him, and I was like, ‘That’s my new favorite player.’”
Hilberth later requested auto-
graphs from Piazza two days in a row during spring training in Flor-ida. 
By the second day, Piazza not 
only remembered her name, but also that it was spelled with a ‘K.’
“That pretty much made my life 
and sealed the deal that he would be my favorite player forever,” Hil-berth said.
Like Piazza, Hilberth has had 
to deal with being underappreci-
ated throughout her career. Hilberth 
doesn’t play particularly glamor-ous roles on either side of the ball. Despite being a part of every play, catchers are generally overlooked, and as a slap hitter, she has yet to hit a home run at UF.
“I think underappreciated is a 
good term just because, at the end of the day, people don’t see the little things she did all day that won us the 
game,” Nelson said. “It’s not an ex-
aggeration when I say that she’s the one making strikeouts look good.”
Even her father, Kamill, didn’t 
fully understand his daughter’s contribution at first. When he and Hilberth were visiting UF for her re-cruiting trip, he asked two questions. As a concerned parent, he wanted to 
know if his daughter would be able 
to continue attending church. The answer to that question was yes, much to his relief. 
His second question, however, 
has been answered on the field.
“He said, ‘No. 2, will she 
ever be able to hit away righty again?’ And I was like, ‘Dad, 
come on.’ He didn’t get the small game,” Hilberth said. “Now he does. He’s like, ‘Great job getting on base.’ But just like most people say the longball is the exciting part — and it is exciting — there are dif-ferent roles for different players on each team.”
If people hadn’t already noticed 
what Hilberth brought to the team, she has shown her full potential in every part of her game this season.
‘Playmaker’ and Leader
In 2007, Hilberth’s teammates 
granted her the nickname “Play-maker” — perhaps an unusual nickname for a slap-hitting catcher. However, she had established her-
self as someone who could step up 
and come through when the team needed her, whether with a conven-tional play or not.“All the good teams have a play-
er like that who doesn’t get caught up in themselves,” Walton said. “That’s a true definition of her char-acter and personality — somebody who always flies underneath the ra-dar, but by the time she’s gone, you really say, ‘Wow, I really appreciate the job that she’s done.’”
This season, Hilberth has already 
turned heads with her offensive production, batting .381 through 45 games and driving in more runs during UF’s first 30 games than she did in the entire 2008 season.
In addition to making plays at 
the plate and behind it, Hilberth has also stepped up as a leader for her 
team. 
She began to learn how to func-
tion as a leader during her fresh-
man season, when she saw her older teammates approach players the right and wrong ways.
“Identifying how every one of 
my teammates responds to different encouragement and different lead-
ership is one of the biggest parts of 
becoming a leader on this team. You can’t use the same thing for all the players on the team,” Hilberth said. 
“We don’t need a rah-rah type 
leader. We just need someone to make sure we’re still on that right path.”
Hilberth’s teammates praise her 
leadership, noting her ability to cor-rect their mistakes on the field with-out being condescending and her willingness to help them with off-the-field problems, including any-thing from injuries to homework.
Left fielder Francesca Enea has 
benefited from Hilberth’s guidance and friendship. When Enea’s ACL 
was torn in the middle of the 2007 
season, Hilberth was constantly checking in on her teammate’s health. 
“She was always like, ‘How are 
your knees?’ And I was like, ‘I’m fine, I’m not the one catching. How are your knees?’” Enea said. “She al-ways wants to make sure everyone 
on the team is doing good and feel-
ing good.”
With the end of her career at UF 
quickly approaching, Hilberth said she is trying to appreciate every-thing around her — the time spent with her teammates, the bullpen sessions with Nelson, the things she has already accomplished — and the 
opportunities she has been given.
“I’m just really grateful that I 
have that view I have right now to 
take a step back and look at what I have right now and not take it for granted,” Hilberth said. 
“Because there is nobody who 
was the starting catcher for the first Super Regional besides me at the 
University of Florida. There’s no-
body besides me who was the start-ing catcher for our first World Series game. Those things mean more to me than anything else as far as our accomplishments.”
If Hilberth and her team accom-
plish the goals they set at the begin-ning of this season, she will be able 
to add one more first to her list: the 
starting catcher on UF’s first national champion softball team.Love of the Game

TALLAHASSEE — Greg Larson got the nod to 
start over Justin Poovey and Patrick Keating, and 
he proved he deserved it.
In his 4 1/3 innings of work, Larson gave up just 
one hit and no runs to offensive powerhouse FSU on Tuesday night.
The UF offense gave him and the bullpen plenty 
of support with 5 runs in the first inning, leading the Gators (24-12) to a 10-2 win against the Semi-noles (21-12) at Dick Howser Stadium and claiming the series 2-1 for UF.
“It’s not too difficult to pitch with a 5-run lead 
in the first,” Larson said. “I just tried not to do too much and just stay within myself.”
Larson’s quality outing Tuesday night was his 
first start of the season. 
The freshman’s first 15 appearances came in re-
lief, and two of them were in the first two match-ups against FSU, when he gave up no runs in 2 1/3 innings.
He carried the lessons he learned in those out-
ings into his start Tuesday.
“I threw against most of the guys before, so I 
kind of knew what their strengths and weaknesses were,” Larson said.
Tony Davis and Billy Bullock finished off what 
Larson started on the mound. Their only hitch came in the seventh inning, when Davis allowed a triple 
off the wall by Mike McGee followed by a homer to 
right-center field by Tommy Oravetz.
The relievers combined to allow just 2 runs and 
five hits in their 4 2/3 innings. Bullock punched out four hitters in two innings.
The two reliable bullpen arms for UF were well-
rested for the rivalry game, having only made two appearances each in the previous five games.
“I told them they both pitched one inning apiece UF BASEBALLLarson makes most of short start
I’m conflicted.
On one hand, everything about 
the Orange and Blue Game is a fun 
experience for fans who haven’t seen their Gators play football in more than three months.
On the other hand, it’s a useless 
waste of time.
On one hand, it’s a great opportuni-
ty — the last opportunity — for seniors 
to watch some football in The 
Swamp.
On the other 
hand, what takes 
place this Satur-
day can barely be 
classified as foot-ball.
On one hand, 
Tim Tebow will be airing out bombs 
and Brandon Spikes will be making 
running backs pay.
On the other hand, they’ll be do-
ing what they do best against players 
wearing the same uniform, they won’t 
be trying their hardest while they’re at it and most of the incoming freshmen won’t be in town.
There are plenty of other UF sports 
to watch this weekend. The Gators baseball team has a three-game series at home against Mississippi, a team with an identical 9-6 record in the Southeast-
ern Conference. The No. 1 UF softball 
team plays three games in Baton Rouge, La., against No. 19 LSU, and both games of the Saturday doubleheader will be televised on Cox Sports. There’s even 
some UF club lacrosse this weekend, as 
the No. 13 Gators men face No. 5 FSU on Friday night. 
How often do you get to see com-
petitive lacrosse on campus?
Yet all of those sports — all of which 
have real meaning toward regular-sea-son records — won’t combine to draw anything close to the number of people 
that will head into Ben Hill Griffin Sta-
dium on Saturday.
Football is king in Gainesville, and

� TEDDY FOSTER HOMERED WEARING THE WRONG JERSEY.
By KYLE MAISTRI
Alligator Staff Writer

TALLAHASSEE — If being a senior 
leader means sacrificing yourself for the team, hitting a home run and remember-ing to bring your jersey on road trips, then Teddy Foster wasn’t just 2 for 3 in the batter’s box on Tuesday.
Donning No. 47 instead of his regular No. 50 jersey, Foster helped UF to a 10-2 defeat of FSU in his class’s final regular-season meeting with the Seminoles.
“I actually left my 
jersey in the locker room, and about 15 to 20 minutes into the bus ride, I realized I 
didn’t have it,” Foster said. “I told some of the staff and they said they had some extras, 
so I’m wearing an old teammate’s from last year (Brett Bentley).”
The backup catcher and first baseman went 2 for 3 with a home run, a sacrifice fly and three RBIs, providing a spark from the No. 8 spot in the batting order. 
Freshmen Daniel Pigott and Preston 
Tucker have become mainstays in the top half of the lineup, but the bottom half hasn’t been so concrete. 
Foster, who has now logged 32 at-bats 
on the season, said it can be difficult to contribute and lead as a veteran when playing time isn’t always there. 
But Tuesday, he made the best of his 
chance to help UF win the season series

UF pitcher Stacey Nelson throws a pitch during the Gators’ 4-1 win against Tennessee 
in Katie Seashole Pressly Stadium on March 22.
Nelson earns invite to USA Team Selection Camp
for us this weekend, so they should have 
been fresh, and we were going to stretch them to two or three innings apiece,” UF 
coach Kevin O’Sullivan said. 
“That was the plan going in. I hate to 
say that it worked out exactly how we 
wanted to, but that’s pretty much the way it went.”
While the Seminoles offense entered 
with a reputation as a high-scoring unit, the Gators’ bats were on display.
The Gators jumped on top with 5 runs 
in the first inning, three coming off the bat of Avery Barnes, who sent a shot over the 
right-field fence and finished 4-for-5 hit-
ting with three RBIs and 2 runs.
UF drove in its other 5 runs over the fifth, sixth and seventh innings. 
The scoring was highlighted by 2-run 
homers by Josh Adams and Teddy Fos-
ter, who accidentally left his No. 50 jersey in Gainesville and wore No. 47 instead.
The double-digit scor-
ing night was just the lat-
est in a recent trend for the once-stagnant Gators offense.
They have plated at least 10 runners in 
four of their last six games, including a 24-run performance on Saturday at Auburn, and are hitting .341 as a team in that span — compared to the season total of .301.
“I feel really good about our lineup, 
and it’s not just the guys at the top, but we are getting contribution from everybody, top to bottom,” O’Sullivan said.Gators continue hot offensive streak against powerhouse Seminoles
with FSU 2-1. 
“It’s a lot easier to lead the team 
on nights like tonight when you 
can lead by example,” he said.
Foster wasn’t the only senior 
leading by example in his final showdown with the Seminoles. Left fielder Avery Barnes went 
4 for 5 and added his second home run in the last four games with a 3-run job over the right-field wall in the first inning.
Barnes conceded that the series-
clinching win probably meant a little bit more to the seniors who will likely never suit up against FSU again.“I feel extremely fortunate to 
have a game like I did,” he said. “If it is the last time, I have something to remember forever.”The only other senior position 
player on UF’s roster is Brandon McArthur, who has played in 13 games against the Seminoles in his six-year career. He turned in a 1-for-4 effort and scored 2 runs before being replaced by freshman Jerico Weitzel in the eighth inning.  
UF coach Kevin O’Sullivan said 
he didn’t make a conscious deci-sion to start his three senior hitters in their last chance to play in Dick Howser Stadium. 
“Teddy’s been swinging the bat 
really well for us — he had a good weekend against Auburn — and B-Mac has played a good third base for us,” he said. “We’re going to put the lineup out there that gives us the best chance to win.”

bring in hundreds of fans looking for a glimpse of their 
favorite wide receiver. 
On Saturday, they’ll get more than just a glimpse. Fans 
will get to see many of next season’s starters and take a peek at who could sneak into the rotation in September.
The roster for the fall has been mostly decided already, 
but with a slew of injuries to players who will start, you’ll get to watch players who wouldn’t normally see this much playing time get a significant slice of the pie.
Running back Emmanuel Moody, who barely saw any 
carries last season unless the game was out of reach, is expected to play prominently in the Orange and Blue Game. 
Walk-on running back Christopher Scott, who has 
been the story of spring practice, will enjoy some time in the limelight during the annual scrimmage. 
Redshirt freshman Sam Robey, whose injured left knee kept him out of action last season, will likely be a starting center in the game. He might even make the cut during the fall.
And, of course, there’s the pageantry that comes with 
gameday in Gainesville. The stadium will be rocking, the cars will line the streets and the tailgaters will come out in force.
So while there may not be much at the Orange and Blue 
Game in terms of important plays, real pressure situations or full-out effort from starters, it’s still worth attending.eVAN , from page 18Baseball■ SHE WILL LEAD UF AGAINST CEN-

This summer, Stacey Nelson could be 
trading in her orange and blue for red, 
white and blue.
UF’s senior ace accepted an invita-
tion to the 2009 USA Softball Women’s National Team Selection Camp in Chula Vista, Calif., starting June 8.  
Nelson will compete against 26 other 
players for a spot on the USA Softball National Team at the camp, which starts just five days after the Women’s College World Series.
“It’s something I never, ever would 
have expected, so it’s a big surprise. I was very excited about it,” Nelson said.
Remaining as modest as ever about her 
continually growing list of accomplish-ments, Nelson said she is still keeping her focus on her last season as a Gator, including tonight’s matchup between No. 1 UF (42-3) and Central Florida (21-22) at 
6 in Katie Seashole Pressly Stadium.
The invitation to play with the nation’s 
best is far from the only notable accolade 
Nelson has racked up this season.
She is now climbing the ranks for the 
most victories in NCAA history. With 120 wins, she is currently tied for ninth with three other pitchers.
“I don’t even know how many wins I 
have,” she said, laughing. “When I first got on the list, No. 25 was Jennie Finch. That was just surreal to me — because 
Jennie Finch is like the ultimate — to hear that I had as many wins as her.”
Nelson, the Southeastern Conference 
Pitcher of the Year last season, is three victories away from tying Angela Tinch-
er, last season’s Player of the Year from Virginia Tech.
Tincher also won the Lowe’s Senior 
CLASS Award in 2008, and Nelson was 
named one of 10 finalists for this year’s 
award. 
The CLASS Award, which stands for 
Celebrating Loyalty and Achievement 
for Staying in School, is given to players 
based on their off-the-field accomplish-ments as well as their performance on it. 
Although Nelson is known for her 
work in the circle, she takes just as much 
pride in being recognized for what she 
does in the community and in the class-room.
“People kind of think of athletes as just 
athletes, and to show that you’re working hard in the classroom and doing other stuff in the community, it’s cool to get recognized for that,” she said.
The winner of the CLASS Award is de-
cided by a combination of coaches, media, sponsors and fan voting.
Nelson, who learned to speak Swahili 
and Yoruba during her time at UF,  has 
been named to the SEC Academic Honor 
Roll for two straight years.
“All my teammates make fun of me — 
especially the ones in the back of the bus — because I’m always doing homework 
on the way to games. If I’m not doing 
homework, then I’m reading about some-thing,” Nelson said. 
“I really feel like the more homework 
I do in a weekend, the better I do (on the field).”
“I feel extremely fortunate 
to have a game like I did.”

during the Gators’ win against Michigan on March 6.

Maybe it’s fitting that the NCAA 
Championships essentially signal the 
arrival of summer for the UF gym-
nastics team, much like exam week in the spring is the sign of summer for students.
The UF gymnasts will still have 
to deal with finals, but the NCAA Championships starting Thursday cap off a semester-long season full of wear and tear.
“We know this is our last week of 
training, our last competition,” Ma-randa Smith said. 
“Summer’s here. We have to set 
goals for our training and already 
start thinking about next year after 
this meet is over.”
This summer, Smith is looking 
forward to getting shoulder surgery 
a week after her return from the na-
tional championship meet.
She said the rehab would take her 
four to six months, ending around the same time the fall semester does. 
Smith said she welcomes the thought 
of being fully healthy again, even if it means spending the summer heal-
ing.
“I love competing and doing gym-
nastics all the time, but sometimes it gets tough when you’re hurting,” 
Smith said.Smith hopes the summer rehab 
will leave her healthy and in-shape enough to “jump back again and be pretty much right where I left off from this year,” she said. 
This year saw Smith turn in her 
best statistical season thus far, in-cluding appearances on balance beam while filling in for injured teammates.
For Courtney Gladys, the end of 
the NCAA Championships will bring a sigh of relief.
“It’s the end of gym for a while, so 
it’s going to be good for a lot of the gymnasts and myself to rest physi-cally and mentally from the sport,” Gladys said. 
Gladys, like Smith, had to increase 
her workload when teammates — the count is now at four — had their sea-sons cut short due to injuries.
Gladys said she takes two to three 
weeks after the NCAA Champion-ships to rest. She’ll be in Gainesville for the 
first part of summer and still plans to condition and practice, but at a much easier pace than when fall rolls around. 
“The three months you’re off, 
yeah, you could take it off, but is it really going to benefit you when you’re pounding in August again?” Gladys said.
There’s no rest for the weary, as 
UF coach Rhonda Faehn has a ban-quet, a coaches’ meeting and recruit-ing on her to-do list following the 
NCAA Championships.
“There’s a little bit of down time,” 
Faehn said, even though she won’t 
really get time off until mid-August.
“It’s weird to say this: (The cham-
pionship) re-energizes us, the coach-ing staff, to already be thinking ahead and getting excited for next season.”
She mentioned how the team 
starts planning routines, discussing new skills, managing lineups and events at the team’s banquet before summer has even started.
“We don’t come and go, ‘It’s time 
to chill and relax and rest,’” Faehn said.FAEHN HEADING TO FAMILIAR TER -
