The Lubavitch-Chabad Jew-
ish Student and Community 
Center will open its doors to all 
students celebrating the Jewish 
New Year.
Rosh Hashanah started 
Wednesday evening and will 
continue until Friday night. 
The center, located at 2021 
NW Fifth Ave., will have ser-
vices in Hebrew and meals for the holiday.
Rabbi Berl Goldman, the 
center’s director, invites ev-eryone to join him for these events.
Goldman said he expects 
more than 500 students to at-tend the services. 
The events are free and stu-
dents of all backgrounds can attend.“We’re wishing the entire 
world a new year,” Goldman said.  “The entire world needs a blessing.”
Some UF professors are can-
celing class or making other 
arrangements because of the 
religious holiday. 
Associate professor Steven 
Brandt in UF’s Department 
of Anthropology said he has 
made accommodations for a student celebrating.
“I have an exam coming up, 
but I excused one student be-
cause of the holiday,” Brandt 
said.
Florencia Bonarto, 20, and 
her roommates said they had 
some of their classes canceled.
Bonarto said even though 
she is not afﬁ  liated with any 
religion, she plans on attending the Jewish Center one night.
“I think it’s nice that they’re 
willing to open their arms to people,” the digital arts and sciences junior said.
This New Year event is fol-
lowed by 10 days of repentence and Yom Kippur, which begins at sundown Oct. 3.Rosh Hashanah observance begins at UF Hillel

The UF Institute of Food and Ag-
ricultural Sciences has welcomed a 
familiar face to the position of dean for research.
Jackie Burns, director for UF’s Cit-
rus Research and Education Center in Polk County, was one of three ﬁ  nal-ists who made the cut in the search for a new dean.
Burns will step in as the new dean 
on Nov. 1 for John Hayes, who left the position in July.
Jack Payne, UF senior vice presi-
dent for agriculture and natural re-
sources, said the national search for 
a dean began in April and included several members of the faculty, stu-dents and stakeholders.
“We wanted to make sure we 
hired the best person we could ﬁ  nd,” he said. “Besides being a researcher, she’s had a long number of years as a top administrator.”
The committee chose seven semi-
ﬁ  nalists in the national search and presented Payne with three choices, Burns among them.
Burns has 89 research publications 
as well as an extensive background in citrus research. Her career at UF be-gan in 1987 as an assistant professor of horticulture at the Citrus Research and Education Center.
Payne said Burns’ citrus research 
has helped slow down the collapse of the citrus industry in Florida.  
“She is an outstanding scientist,” 
Payne said. “She is leading the battle against the biggest challenge that cit-rus has had in the world.”
Several stakeholders, including 
the Florida Farm Bureau, had a hand in interviewing prospective candi-IFAS has new research dean

People Dedicated to Quality is coming to 
Gainesville this spring, and the fast, casual 
chicken chain is bringing its hand-breaded tenders, hand-spun milkshakes and signa-ture sauces.
The restaurant, known as PDQ, will re-
place the former Grandy’s at 3401 W. Uni-
versity Ave. and will open early next year.
Jeffrey Kamis, a PDQ spokesman, said 
he is excited to expand the franchise to 
Gainesville.
“For us, we really focus on the things 
that make us a little different,” Kamis said.
The chain restaurant only serves fresh 
food, Kamis said. From the sauces to the dressings and the fresh-cut fries, every-
thing is in-house and made to order.
Prices range from $7 to $9 for meals and about $2 for sides.
“People are always looking for some-
thing with great value, great quality and 
something quick, so we really focus on those three things,” he said.
PDQ, which is partially owned by Tim 
Tebow, will start hiring this fall. Those in-terested can apply online at eatpdq.com.
UF economics junior Ralph Grauer, 20, 
is a full supporter of the chain making its debut in Gainesville, calling the restau-rant’s staple the “most ﬂ  uffy chicken ten-ders from this side of the Mississippi.”“PDQ tenders are the best,” Grauer said. “Their sauces are unparalleled, and their 
apple slices are fresh.”  Chicken chain PDQ coming to 
Gainesville, replaces Grandy’s

A new study conducted by UF scien-
tists has discovered how fossils can rep-
licate lost biodiversity caused by human impact.
The study reconstructs the ancient 
food web of the Bahamian Island of Abaco, home to the endangered Cuban crocodile and the now-extinct Albury’s tortoise.
In the study, sponsored by the Na-
tional Science Foundation and National Geographic Society, scientists analyzed the types of carbon and nitrogen in the well-preserved fossil bones.
“My role in the study was to help 
the team construct ancient food webs by understanding stable isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen, which mirror the foods that animals eat,” said John Krig-baum, UF anthropologist and co-author for the study.
Knowing about past food webs pro-
vides information about how species survive, Krigbaum said.
The data from the study revealed 
that the crocodile and tortoise were both 
terrestrial, indicating reptiles were the 
dominant creatures on Abaco.
The dominant reptiles demonstrated 
the energy ﬂ  ow through island ecosys-tems is slower paced than in continen-tal ones, said David Steadman, Florida Museum of Natural History ornithology curator and study co-author.
“This helps to explain why islands 
experience so much extinction once non-native mammals arrive,” he said.Fossils reveal food websNATIONAL

The U.S. Marshals Service celebrated its 
225th anniversary Wednesday.
On Aug. 6, Gov. Rick Scott declared Sept. 
24 Florida’s U.S. Marshals Day.  
Created by the 1789 Judiciary Act when 
George Washington appointed its ﬁ  rst 13 
agents, the U.S. Marshals Service is the na-tion’s oldest federal law enforcement agen-cy.
“The agency’s task forces, technology and investigative expertise have made the idea of 
fugitives escaping justice nearly impossible,” 
U.S. Marshal Ed Spooner of the Northern District of Florida said in a press release.
The U.S. Marshals is now made of 5,400 
deputies and civil servants. In the 1960s, the service enforced court orders related to civil rights and the South’s desegregation.
Last year, task force members in 
Gainesville, Tallahassee, Panama City and 
Pensacola were responsible for clearing 1,264 
warrants, including 47 arrests for homicide, 95 for robbery and 188 for sex offenses.
Deputy U.S. Marshal Bryon Carroll en-
couraged UF students who are interested in law enforcement careers to look more into the agency.
“When I was a UF student, the rich history 
of the Marshals Service was one of the things 
that attracted me to the agency,” he said.Marshals celebrates 225 years

Ride ‘Em Low
A lowrider waits in traffic in front of the Gator Wesley Foundation on Wednesday afternoon.
She started working at UF in 1987 
dates for the job.
“We had the heads of several 
departments on our committee,” 
he said. “These people benefit from our research, which is why 
they have a say in who we choose 
as dean.”
Juandavid Orejuela, a 20-year-
old UF food and resource eco-nomics junior, said he hopes the new appointment will make the college thrive.
“People don’t think agricul-
ture is important, but it is,” Ore-juela said. “They just don’t know how much. Even now, it feels like IFAS is growing.”
Burns said in a press release 
that she will work toward pro-tecting natural resources and in-dustries related to the subject.  
“IFAS has a significant base 
of established research expertise and creativity, with programs of renown,” she said in an IFAS 
press release. “Although there are 
challenges ahead, these should be great opportunities for IFAS program leadership.”
As of May, Burns has been 
earning an annual salary of $172,190 as a professor, accord-ing to public record. Payne said he will be working with Burns 
to negotiate her salary in the up-
coming weeks.

A man was arrested at about 10 p.m. 
Tuesday after police saw him passed out 
in his car with a can of air duster.
Gainesville Police responded to a call 
regarding a man huffing spray cans in 
Butler Plaza, at 3552 SW Archer Road, 
spokesman Officer Ben Tobias said.
When officers arrived at the location, 
police said Rodney Plylar was passed out in his vehicle, clutching a can of air duster to his chest. It appeared as if Ply-lar passed out after inhaling the toxic substance.
After he was read his rights, police 
said Plylar told them he was “huffing since the sun was up.”
Officers found about 50 cans of air 
duster after Plylar consented to a search of his vehicle. Most of the cans were emp-ty. The can that Plylar was holding still had chemical in it and was cold, mean-ing it was recently used, police said.
Plylar was arrested on charges of 
inhaling harmful chemicals. He had a bond of $5,000 and was released shortly before 3 p.m. Wednesday.

Investigations determined the kid-
napping incident involving Donald Mobley last week did not occur as origi-nally reported.
The 61-year-old was arrested Sept. 16 
on kidnapping and battery charges after police said he kicked a 6-year-old and 
forced her friend, 8, into his apartment.
However, Tobias said there were 
discrepancies in the 8-year-old’s origi-
nal story. That, along with physical evi-dence, proves Mobley’s complete inno-cence, he said.
Police said they are now certain Mob-
ley did not kidnap or harm the child in any way. Instead, police said she went 
inside of Mobley’s apartment voluntari-
ly, and the door was left open while she was inside. The girl left Mobley’s resi-dence after her friend threatened to tell her parents where she was.
GPD investigators filed paperwork 
with the State Attorney’s office stating the latest developments and suggest-ing Mobley be released from Alachua 
County Jail.Police roundup: car huffer;

The boardwalk at Loblolly Woods Nature 
Park won’t be ready for runners, bikers and 
dog walkers until early next year.
The path, which has been closed for repairs 
since May, will start renovations within the 
next month, said Linda Demetropoulos, nature 
and cultural manager for Gainesville Parks, Recreation and Cultural Affairs. Construction could take up to five months.
“That’s a really loved structure,” Demetro-
poulos said. “We realize it’s an inconvenience, and we are working just as quickly as the sys-tem will allow us to get that open.”
The site was expected to open this fall, but 
Demetropoulos said paperwork processing time caused the delay.
Connecting Eighth and 16th avenues, the 
boardwalk was popular for runners and cy-
clists, but its location within the wetlands of the park made it susceptible to weathering.
“There were places where you could see 
there were holes in the boards and the potential 
for people to get hurt,” Demetropoulos said.
About $140,000 will be taken from the city’s 
available capital improvement funds to pay for the repair, she said
Students and residents who frequented the 
path must now take a detour through the Ma-son Manor boardwalk off Northwest 25th Ter-race.
Sarah Ring, a UF applied physiology and 
kinesiology senior, said the boardwalk was a favorite of hers because of its convenient con-nection between Eighth and 16th avenues.
“Last spring, I was training a lot for a triath-
lon, and one day I went for a run expecting it to be open and it wasn’t,” Ring, 21, said.
She has since taken different routes, many 
of which force her to run on the road.  
“It’s kind of unfortunate,” she said. “I’ve 
run past it with the hopes of running through all those trails again.”
For now, the Loblolly boardwalk, which 
connects Eighth and 16th avenues, is closed. 
Pedestrians can use Mason Manor boardwalk 
off Northwest 25th Terrace as an alternative route for access to Loblolly Woods and Hog-town Creek.Loblolly construction delay,

tractor down a dirt field 
Wednesday, a group gath-

“It was a new experi-
ence, but it was easier than 
I thought,” Sultana, 18, said. 
“Once you’ve driven the first 
round, you feel like a pro.”
Sultana and other stu-
dents took part in UF’s Com-munity Farm open house Wednesday at the UF Insti-
tute of Food and Agricultur-
al Sciences’ Teaching Farms and Student Gardens.
Anna Prizzia, adviser for 
the Gator Gardening Club, said UF Community Farm 
promotes conversations 
about sustainable agriculture and food systems.
“We wanted to host the 
event because we wanted to bring more awareness about 
the farm and the resources 
that are here and get more people engaged and in-
volved,” Prizzia said.
Local farmers offered 
complimentary roselle tea, fruit and planting seeds to 
those who stopped at their 
booths.The produce from the 
participating farmers at the 
event is available for pur-
chase through the Gator 
Community Supported Ag-riculture program in which people subscribe to local 
farms and obtain items that 
grow during the harvest pe-riod. 
Student organizations 
such as Collegiate 4-H and Get Fruved were on hand to 
provide information on lead-
ing healthy lifestyles and getting involved in the com-
munity.
Activities included an 
open beehive demonstration and learning to drive a trac-
tor.
Prizzia said she hopes 
students were encouraged to learn more about food sys-tems as well as UF Commu-
nity Farm resources.
“I hope they just get an 
awareness of the fact that the farm is here and that there’s 
lots of different ways to get involved,” Prizzia said.Community Farm

Gators are now able to 
pay it forward with a new UF 
Alumni Association member-
ship. Gators who are not yet members can receive a $25 one-year membership and ex-
tend this opportunity to a fel-
low Gator.    
This membership includes 
everything the annual mem-
bership, which was originally 
set at $40, does. Alumni and 
current students can gift this 
membership anonymously to a student within his or her col-lege or club or a recent gradu-ate.
Gators all over the coun-
try have the chance to get in-
volved, said Chris Cupoli, se-
nior director of membership 
and philanthropy for alumni 
affairs.  
“No matter where you are, 
when you see another Gator 
you feel connected to them,” 
Cupoli said. “It’s an action and a story to tell. It’s a natural way to describe what we do to 
invest overall in the alumni as-
sociation.”   
Students, staff and alumni 
can share their stories using 
the Twitter hashtag #GatorOn. 
Their stories about why they 
decided to participate will be 
shared on the GatorOn Tumblr page.
“We recognize that the UF alumni base is prideful and loves being connected, and we are always looking for ways to strengthen that,” Cupoli said. “This is an opportunity to tap into that immediate connection we have with other Gators.”
Cupoli foresees this cam-
paign being a digital conversa-tion that will be shared among all social media platforms.
According to the UF Alum-
ni Association website, the campaign is a way for Gators to reconnect with UF and help build support for scholarships, research and new facilities on campus.
Alex Povella, a 20-year-old 
UF anthropology junior, said the association helps keep alumni informed and involved about what is happening 
around campus.
“We go to school here at the 
University of Florida for four 
years, but we still consider ourselves Gators for life,” Pov-ella said.
Povella has previously been 
a member of the association but said a decrease in price would deﬁ  nitely entice him to renew his membership.
The membership includes 
a discount on food at local res-taurants, deals on hotels, rental car agencies and salons. Mem-bers will receive exclusive ac-cess and priority entry at a va-riety of events.

berships on the UF Alumni As-sociation website.Gators pay it forward

The UF College of Nursing is 
working to give some much-needed 
warmth to UF Health Shands Hos-pital patients.
The College of Nursing and the 
Shands palliative care program are working together to gift knitted shawls to patients living with chron-ic or life-threatening illnesses.
The Comfort Shawls Project con-
nects volunteers with knitters from the Thelma A. Boltin Senior Activity Center in Gainesville, where seniors will teach them how to craft shawls 
for patients.
Joan Castleman, one of the proj-
ect coordinators, said the project 
connects knitters young and old.
“For the women at Thelma Bolt-in, this is a real passion for them, and 
I think they’re excited about work-
ing with the nursing students,” Cas-tleman, a clinical associate profes-sor at the College of Nursing, said. “The knitting becomes a wonderful way of learning a new skill, learning about other generations and letting go of some of life’s stressors.”
The Comfort Shawls Project is 
open to beginners and more ad-vanced knitters. The project has pro-vided more than 30 shawls to pallia-tive care patients since forming the volunteer group last Spring.
Castleman said when the shawls 
are completed by the volunteers, pa-tients select the shawls they want.
“The students have the opportu-
nity to learn more about palliative care as they work with families in selecting a shawl,” she said.The college is asking volunteers 
to use yarn that is both soft and washable. They also ask that volun-teers machine wash and dry their shawls to remove any potential al-lergens.
Volunteers can contact the shawl 
project organizers to arrange a local pickup for their completed shawls.
Kristin Blanzy, a UF master’s 
student in public health, said the initiative the college is promoting is beneﬁ  cial to patients.
“I’m sure it increases their morale 
and makes their stay more comfort-ing,” said Blanzy, 25. “To know that people are doing something special for you is uplifting and can help them improve their quality of life.”
The College of Nursing welcomes 
donations of yarn or other ﬁ  nancial contributions to the shawl project.

from the #gamergate dweebs, Emma Watson graced the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday with her 
radiant presence to make an important announcement.
Watson attended the meeting to promote HeForShe, 
the U.N.’s new program dedicated to including men in the 
struggle for gender equality.
Watson’s speech was monumental. The lofty goal of 
ending gendered bias and discrimination, she said, must come about through the combined efforts of men and women.
She offered personal testimony about how she and oth-
er women she knew growing up have been affected by the stereotypes and expectations thrust upon them.
But she also included men in these stories. Watson 
explained that stereotypes and expectations of how men should behave are hurtful to them as well. All genders are compelled to live and behave in certain ways, while con-stantly being judged on how well they hold up to these standards.
Watson talked about her own personal experiences: that 
she was sexualized by the media at a young age, how her female friends quit their sports teams because they didn’t want to look too athletic and her male friends repressed their feelings for fear of being perceived as feminine.
Watson said this is why she wants to reclaim the word 
feminism from its status as a pejorative slur, which to so many represents a cover for misandry.
Rather, she correctly stated that women’s rights go 
hand-in-hand with human rights, and thus, all humans 
should feel connected to the cause.
To dispel any of the misguided notions that men are 
unwanted in the feminist movement, Watson extended us 
a formal invitation to the struggle for gender equality.
Many of feminism’s detractors claim it is a female-su-
premacist movement that inherently discriminates against men.
This is clearly not the case, but it is important to en-sure that feminism continues to embrace and welcome men and women alike.
For the U.N. — the organiza-
tion that comes closest to repre-
senting the entire world popula-
tion — to establish a campaign encouraging both men and wom-en to participate in the struggle for equal rights is an enormous 
stride in the right direction.
Although it should not have required heartfelt testimo-
ny from a massively popular actress to inspire new dis-cussion at the U.N. about women’s rights, the enthusiasm 
surrounding the HeForShe campaign is a very big deal.
Along with our own government’s recently announced 
It’s On Us campaign, HeForShe shows that the movement 
for gender equality is being supported by our highest in-stitutions. Groups supporting equality are gaining grass-roots traction.
From the top-down and bottom-up, the women’s rights 
movement is achieving progress in all parts of society — equal rights may even be a reality in our lifetime.
If the HeForShe campaign inspires real, meaningful ac-
tion on this issue, it’s possible that Watson will be remem-bered for her part in leading the charge more than her role as Hermione.
Unfortunately, not everyone has expressed the support 
for the women’s rights movement that it deserves. 
The issues of domestic violence and sexual assault 
still rear their ugly heads on a daily basis in America and around the world.
But the equality gap is closing.When feminism and gender equality are fully em-
braced by our society’s mainstream leaders and institu-tions, people all over the world — both men and women — will beneﬁ  t immensely.
Alec Carver is a UF journalism sophomore. His columns 
appear on Thursdays.FSU’s presidential 
selection major 
mistake
On Tuesday, the Florida State University Board of Trust-ees selected state Sen. John Thrasher as the university’s next president.
Thrasher’s selection was not surprising given his extensive 
and inﬂ  uential political connections.
Thrasher is currently a co-chair of the re-election campaign 
for Gov. Rick Scott. The governor appointed a signiﬁ  cant num-ber of the FSU board members, many of whom have supported Thrasher in his previous political pursuits.
Of the four ﬁ  nalists for the FSU presidency, Thrasher was the 
only one without signiﬁ  cant academic leadership experience. Not only does Thrasher not have the necessary experience to qualify him for FSU’s presidency, he has demonstrated a funda-mental lack of respect for academic and scientiﬁ  c research.
During one of his interviews for the position, Thrasher was 
asked about his views on the theory of evolution. 
His answer? “I have a great faith in my life that has guided 
me in my life in a lot of things I believe in.”
Thrasher’s answer implies that he rejects the widely accepted 
scientiﬁ  c theory of evolution in favor of a religious belief in intel-ligent design and creationism. Although he is certainly entitled to his religious views, someone with such disdain for basic sci-ence is not ﬁ  t to lead a public institution of higher learning.
The creation of high-tech jobs in science and technology will 
be critical to the growth and development of Florida’s economy in future decades. The foundation for this advanced economy must be provided by the education that students receive at Flor-ida’s public universities.
Granting the presidency of one of the state’s largest public 
universities to an individual who has rejected some of the most basic and widely accepted principles of modern science is a dan-gerous step backward for the entire state of Florida.
Beside his utter lack of qualiﬁ  cations, the selection of Thrash-
er as FSU’s president also disregarded the will of both the uni-versity’s faculty and Student Body.
Earlier this month, the FSU Faculty Senate voted 39-23 to 
oppose Thrasher’s inclusion as a ﬁ  nalist for the spot. Business Insider reported that after an open forum with FSU students, a survey found that only 11 percent of attendees rated Thrasher’s performance during the event as “good.”  The vast majority, 87 percent, deemed it  “not good” or “below average.”
Thrasher’s supporters claim his political and business con-
nections will help improve FSU’s fundraising prowess and aid in the school’s goal of becoming a top-25 public university.
Unfortunately, Thrasher’s hostility toward academia and his 
lack of experience in the education sector seem likely to lead FSU in precisely the opposite direction.
The selection of Thrasher as the new head of FSU sets a dan-
gerous precedent as UF searches for a new president of its own.
If UF seeks to continue its ascension toward a top university 
ranking, the Board of Trustees must be sure to select a president based on the best interests of Gators students and faculty and not based on political clout.

On Friday night, the walls of San-
ta Fe College’s Fine Arts Hall reso-
nated with the same award-winning vocals that took home the title of American Idol in 2003.
Ruben Studdard, winner of the 
second season of the Fox singing show “American Idol,” charmed the Gainesville community with his ro-mantic ballads and engaging stories when he performed as part of SFC’s 
Master Artist Series.
The Master Artist Series is a fea-
ture of SFC’s fine arts program that brings arts professionals to campus 
to teach and mentor students in dance, music and theater, finishing the experience with performances.
A vital part of the series is that the 
artists do more than perform. They spend special time with the students and get involved in the community.
“We look for an artist who is 
ready to give back (and) under-stands it’s not just about a concert,” said Alora Haynes, fine arts depart-ment chairperson at SFC.
Studdard was chosen because 
of his diversity of musical expertise that Haynes believed would connect with the community.
The 36-year-old artist has re-
leased multiple albums, earned sev-eral Grammy and American Music Award nominations, toured as “Fats Waller” in the national stage pro-duction of “Ain’t Misbehavin’” and 
acquired a string of gold and plati-
num records.
“I wanted to have an artist who 
wouldn’t just really relate to stu-dents but the community of Santa Fe,” she said.
They involved the community 
by inviting local gospel choirs to ac-company Studdard on his final two 
songs alongside the Santa Fe Sing-
ers students. One of the final songs was “Flying Without Wings,” the song Studdard sang when he won American Idol.
“It was such an honor to perform 
with Ruben,” said Brittany Howe, an 18-year-old Santa Fe biology sophomore and a part of the Santa Fe Singers. “He’s an excellent per-former and an excellent person to work with.”
Haynes said she believes having 
someone of his caliber and recogni-tion reiterate what students learn 
from their teachers served as a great 
support to the faculty.
“It puts a punctuation mark on 
what they’ve already learned from their faculty,” she said. “He won ‘American Idol,’ and he’s won our hearts.”

When the first Original Gainesville Food 
Truck Rally opened one Saturday in January 
2013, thousands of people lined up to sam-ple food from six local food trucks. 
“We started at 7 p.m.,” Pat Lavery, owner 
of Glory Days Presents!, said. “By 7:10 you couldn’t see the pavement.”
Lavery, who handles promotions and 
bookings for downtown bar and venue High Dive, said the food-truck rally idea came to him when he learned that other towns hosted similar events. At the time, “The Great Food Truck Race” was gaining popularity on the Food Network, and the Pelican Brothers Food Truck was already a fixture in High Dive’s parking lot.
Since then, the rallies have doubled in 
size and grown to include screenings of col-lege football games and performances by lo-cal musicians. On Saturday night, more than nine food trucks will serve cuisines ranging from the Pelican Brothers’ signature chicken and waffles with maple gravy to wood-fired pizza at Humble Pie and Asian-fusion at Heart & Seoul. Plenty of vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free options will also be available at the rally. 
Saturday’s rally will also feature a new 
vendor: Mojo Grill, an Ocala-based restau-rant and catering company that offers a va-riety of Latin American- and Cajun/Creole-inspired dishes. 
In order to foster a festival-inspired at-
mosphere, Lavery said, the rally will also include new kid-friendly activities like face-painting and glitter tattoo stations.
The rally starts at 5 p.m., and admission 
is free. Though Gainesville ordinances pro-hibit alcohol to be taken outside during the rally, High Dive’s full bar will be open in-side serving its signature fresh fruit-infused vodka Mason jar drinks.

“Les Miserables” is a tale of salvation, and that’s just 
what Gainesville Community Playhouse expects to show in 
its own production.
The community theater is ready to get back on its feet 
with a surefire season, beginning with “Les Miserables,” 
which will open Friday night and run through Oct. 19 at the 
Vam York Theater.
The community theater is seeking revival from financial 
struggles through the revolutionary story that has reached millions around the world.
“I expect or hope that it will raise the 
money it needs to raise,” said Daniel Chris-tophy, the show’s director. “I also hope it does well to bring to light what talent we have in Gainesville.”
Christophy said the 210-seat theater, lo-
cated at 4039 NW 16th Blvd., is expected to 
fill with people because of how popular and in demand the show is.
“We’ve got the most talented singers that I’ve ever had 
the privilege to work with. There’s not a weak link in this cast,” said Thomas Sanders, who plays the antagonist, Jav-ert.
Sanders has been part of the community since 2006, but 
he is better known for his comedic and song-filled personal-ity on Vine. He has more than three million Vine followers and is the winner of Ryan Seacrest’s Favorite Vine Celebrity 
Contest, but Sanders still remains a loyal member of the the-
ater’s family.
Regular admission is $20, senior admission is $16 and 
students with IDs and children can purchase tickets for $12. Tickets can be purchased through the box office at 352-376-4949.Les Mis premieres Friday at Vam York Theater for 3-week run THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 25, 2014  ALLIGATOR, 9 8, ALLIGATOR  THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 25, 2014

What happens when two Florida State University 
frat bro alumni get together?
They create a ﬁ  lm inspired by a combination of 
real life college stories dealing with breakups.
Jordan Rosner and Juan Gallego teamed up to 
create a comedic ﬁ  lm, “Mantervention,” based on 
Gallego’s breakup and the summer he spent as a bartender getting over it.
“Mantervention” is the process of getting over the 
ex and #ontothenext, according to the ﬁ  lm’s trailer. It will debut today at the Hippodrome State Theatre at 8 p.m.
The main character, Spencer (played by Nick 
Roux), has his heart broken by a girl he thought he 
was in love with. Even though he could get any girl, 
he waits for the right one. His close friends, on the other hand, convince him that the only way to get over his heartbreaker is to hook up as much as pos-sible. Just when his life seems to be spiraling out of control, he meets Katie (played by Chloe Bridges), who seems to be going through similar issues..
“It’s based on … a lot of interesting characters in 
the fraternity,” Rosner said. 
The 36-year-old was one of the main producers of 
the ﬁ  lm. He said it highlights the pressure in college and how “it’s not OK to be ‘that guy,’ or it’s not as accepted … to be a hopeless romantic.”
Scriptwriter Gallego, 1999 FSU graduate and Pi 
Lambda Phi brother, said the overall production of the ﬁ  lm deﬁ  nitely surpassed his expectations with regards to his vision.
The movie’s advice is to “be yourself, not try to 
change who you are or mold yourself to make others 
happy,” Gallego, 39, said.
Rosner said the fact that both love interests, the 
male and female leads, have their own ﬂ  aws and 
struggle with similar issues make the ﬁ  lm interest-ing. Together, they help each other grow as indi-viduals.
“I think it has something for everyone,” he said. 
“Whether you’re the man-whore or you’re the guy who … really believes in the fairytale … same with 
females.”FSU alumni create break-up ﬁ  lm,

I had the pleasure of sitting down 
with Moonbeard for a drink at 
Loosey’s this week. 
This four-piece, college rock 
group will be some of the local talent 
you’ll see this year at FEST 13. 
You can ﬁ  nd Moonbeard on Fa-
cebook and at bandcamp.com; go 
ahead and give a like and look out for the band’s newest release, which it hopes to have out by the end of October. 
I was able to get to know 
the band at its favorite local 
watering hole and ask the 
members some questions. 
Q: What are you guys 
listening to right now that kinda pushed the songwriting that’s go-ing on right now?
Cory: ovlov.Chico: I’d like to think it’s a wide 
array of inﬂ  uences overall that are part of the sound, early Weezer, ob-viously Dinosaur Jr., even as far back as Big Star, maybe yeah, but ovlov is one of the contemporaries.
Josh: I think hearing the record 
that came out last year kinda trig-gered a lot of what’s happened with 
us afterwards.
Q: How do you guys feel about 
being a local act on FEST?
Josh: FEST is huge. There’s a lot 
of unfair publicity just for 
playing FEST. You don’t even have to be good for 
people to check your band 
out and like it.
Cory: We’re up to like 
two likes a day on Facebook.
Chico: What’s really cool 
for me is that, especially for me, be-ing in my old band and being on tour and stuff, it’s kinda like a family re-union with bands that you’ve played 
with from around that country, I’m 
very excited. I have friends that are from England that will be here and playing, and it’s really cool.
Q: What’s your guys’ favorite 
venue to play locally?
Chico: This place (Loosey’s) is 
f***ing great because the owners, 
they really give a s*** about local 
musicians.
Brian: Yeah, Loosey’s is probably 
the best place to play in town.
Josh: Yeah, free food, free beer.Chico: I love 1982. Jen Vito is like 
one of the most amazing human be-ings I’ve met since I’ve moved here.
Cory: She seems like she likes 
Moonbeard.
Chico: Oh no, she loves the 
Moonbeard.
For FEST 13, Moonbeard will be 
playing on Nov. 1 at 10:40 p.m. at 1982 Bar, 919 W. University Ave.

Horror fans will not want to 
miss the activities the Hippo-drome State Theatre has planned in October because there’s some-thing different to scream at every 
week. 
“The Rocky Horror Picture 
Show” is among the string of 
productions at the theater this October. Go all out and dress up as your favorite character, or just go for the cult classic. Showtimes are Oct. 24 at 10:30 p.m., Oct. 25 at 11 p.m., Oct. 31 at 10:30 p.m. and 
Nov. 1 at 11 p.m.
Other ﬁ  lms that are sure 
to spook audiences are “Dead 
Snow: Red vs. Dead,” “Honey-moon” and “Horns.” 
If man-eating Nazi zombies sound appealing to you, “Dead Snow: Red vs. Dead” will give you enough graphic content to quench your thirst until next year. It will be paired with a bar stocked full with themed drinks.  
In “Honeymoon,” you’ll fol-
low a newly married couple to a disturbing remote lake and learn 
what love looks like when it’s 
truly for worse.
“Harry Potter” fans will get a 
chance to see Daniel Radcliffe in “Horns.” A murder leaves Radc-liffe’s character, who awakes one morning with two horns, des-tined to seek revenge. 
Whether it’s blood, darkness, 
discomfort or costumes you are seeking, the Hippodrome will be your haunted destination for this season of scare. Hippodrome will cater

� HOW DO YOU EAT YOUR 
OREOS? 
KELSI & KERI MATWICK 
Avenue Writers
Eating, like cooking, is an outlet 
for creativity and manipulation. Take 
Oreos, for instance. Do you eat the frosting ﬁ  rst and save the chocolate wafers for last? Do you carefully take 
apart the cookie to separate the ﬁ  lling 
and then scrape it off with your teeth? Or do you chomp through the whole cookie?
Each method is personal, 
and playing with food is some-thing we all do. Yet, creative eating goes beyond mere in-gestion, as folklorist Elizabeth 
Adler suggests. 
“The order, control, and 
risk-taking involved in creative 
eating are fundamental to art, and cre-ative eating is a type of art in which we all participate from an early age,” she wrote. Cooking and food presentation have long been considered an art form, and eating may also be a practiced art.
The Oreo cookie is just one exam-ple. Let’s consider another: breakfast. Whether sweet or savory, light or sub-stantial, breakfast embraces every tem-
po and individual preference and has 
more speciﬁ  city than any other meal. How you take your coffee or how long you steep your tea is so particular. Cof-fee shops, such as Starbucks, work to meet your preferences and customize the beverage accordingly, even mark-ing your name on it. 
Observing how people eat food — 
like Oreos —  indicates that eating is more than just nourishment. Some creative eating is learned by observ-
ing others, particularly when a new food or food combina-tion is introduced. Whereas Americans may eat sushi by dipping the ﬁ  sh and rice into the soy sauce, a Japanese per-
son insists on only dipping 
the ﬁ  sh into it. By imitating others, we become a part of 
the in-group, or we may insist on our idiosyncrasies and create new ways of eating.
All these decisions are not only 
your preferences, but also a collection of rituals that deﬁ  ne you.Eating offers creativity10, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 25, 2014

A popular page is pulling away from 
the social news-based website Reddit.
Parker Ruhstaller, the creator of the 
LifeProTips subreddit, is launching 
lifeprotips.com in October, making con-tent more accessible and organized.
The idea for LifeProTips started as a 
side project: Ruhstaller wanted to put ar-ticles and tips from all over the Internet 
into one location.
The subreddit started out with only 30 
posts and a banner before he left it alone 
and forgot about it. In the time he was ab-
sent, it gained a lot of attention. 
He got phone calls from friends saying 
they saw ads for the page. Within three 
years, LifeProTips became a default sub-
reddit with more than a million subscrib-
ers.
Eduardo Mondragon, an 18-year-old 
freshman from the Gator Engineering at Santa Fe program, started using Reddit 
when he was in the eighth grade.  He used 
Reddit to answer questions about God 
and atheism and found other subreddits 
he enjoyed. 
He has used LifeProTips to keep cool 
in the summer without air conditioning: 
When he asked how to stay cool at night, 
someone suggested putting his pillow case in the freezer before going to bed. 
It worked.Ruhstaller said as LifeProTips became 
more popular, people began to take ad-vantage of the page, and low-quality posts 
appeared. 
Reddit uses a system, called karma, 
where the more links someone posts, the 
more points that person obtains. This re-sulted in fake tips just so people could 
gain karma.“For some reason, 
people have this affinity to gain karma on Reddit, 
which is really weird,” Ruhstaller said. “People 
are way into it.”
As users took advan-
tage of the site for karma 
and the page grew, it became too difficult to manage.
 He hired moderators to help keep the 
page under control and set some rules, 
but not all moderators had the best inten-tions. 
Once a subreddit has more than 
100,000 people, trouble starts to brew, and 
the page becomes difficult to handle, said 
Gary Phillips, the creator and a moderator 
of the FloridaGator subreddit. 
He’s been on Reddit for eight years and 
has moderated a page that had 40,000 su-scribers for five. Eventually, managing the 
page becomes a full-time job without pay.
“After a while it’s not fun anymore,” 
he said.
Ruhstaller said despite hiccups with 
moderators and rude users, LifeProTips 
has had relatively smooth sailing.
Many users wished the tips were more 
organized and easy to find. Where this 
was next to impossible to do on a site like Reddit, it was much simpler to accomplish 
on a separate website. 
His motivation for launching the web-
site is forming a closely knit community 
that can make people’s lives easier. He 
believes the information available on 
LifeProTips is basic knowledge that ev-
eryone should have to make their lives 
easier.
“When someone uses something you 
use and talks about it, that’s worth more to me than money,” he said.LifeProTips: subrebbit starts

As part of Hispanic Heritage 
Month, the 13th annual Downtown Latino Festival will fill Bo Diddley 
Community Plaza on Saturday 
from 3 to 9 p.m. with local Hispan-ics celebrating their culture. This 
year, the event aims to reach out to 
Hispanic youth.
“We’re having a student art 
and poetry exhibition,” said Sara Puyana, the assistant coordinator 
and owner of both Flaco’s Cuban 
bakeries in Gainesville. “We’re try-ing to reach out to the community 
and bring the younger generation 
so they can see that it’s something we want them to remember and to 
be proud of.”
The addition raises cultural 
awareness and makes the event 
more family friendly. This year’s festival will also include a kids 
zone, complete with bounce hous-
es and face painting.“There will also be a parade 
of flags, 21 countries including the United States,” Puyana said. “While we’re trying to keep our 
culture, that doesn’t mean that we 
don’t want to adopt the new cul-
ture that has accepted us.”
At least 19 Hispanic countries’ 
cuisines will be represented, said 
Wilfredo Melendez, founder of the 
Chamber of Hispanic Affairs. Lo-cal bands will also be performing 
at this year’s festival, including 
Corazon Violeta, 352 Panas and Ramos Pinta.
“The festival provides a way for 
the community to come out and 
celebrate its heritage and show-
case the contributions the Hispanic community has made not only on 
the national level but on the local 
level,” Melendez said.Hispanic Heritage Month to reach out to younger generationsculture

Painting brought vibrancy to Jess Yelvington’s life when 
she faced difficult times with her health. 
Her paintings and many other local artists’ work will 
be displayed at this Friday’s ArtWalk Gainesville, span-
ning through businesses and restaurants downtown. This 
month’s ArtWalk is collaborating with the Latina Women’s League’s annual Latino film festival.
Yelvington dabbled with drawing and painting her 
whole life, but her distinct style did not develop until Febru-
ary 2013. 
“In February, I started having double vision, and around 
that time I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis,” she said. 
For a month, she could see to arms length, and anything 
beyond that was doubled or blurred. 
“I did a lot of painting during that time, and you can see there was a lot of wild eyes in my artwork,” she said. “It definitely had an influence on my style.”
On Friday, she will be painting live at ArtWalk’s head-
quarters tent in Bo Diddley Community Plaza, 111 E. Uni-versity Ave. 
Yelvington, who has been involved with ArtWalk for 
about a year, will be working on a large 36-by-48 piece with butterflies for the ArtWalk. She paints with acrylic paint on wood panels.
“I’m probably going to have a Frida Kahlo-inspired piece 
there with a little bit of Latin influence for the festival,” she said.September’s ArtWalk Gainesville showcases local artist

A bye week could not have 
come at a better time for the 
Gators.
Coming off a 42-21 loss to No. 
3 Alabama that saw Florida give up the most yards in program history, improvements need to 
be made.
“Extremely disappointed 
two games in a row of giving 
up the big plays we’ve given up defensively,” Muschamp said. 
“We’ve got to get some things 
tied together better on the back end. That’s the bottom line.”
Between missing more than 
20 tackles against Alabama, allowing the Crimson Tide to convert 75 percent of its third-down attempts and surrendering 21 plays of at least 15 yards since 
Southeastern Conference play began, coach Will Muschamp said Wednesday that changes are 
coming.
For Muschamp consistency 
is key, and the defense has been anything but consistent.
The secondary has been 
torched to the tune of 409 yards per game in SEC action, with five of the eight touchdown passes it has given up being at least 25 
yards.
“We’re looking at a lot of 
different guys in different 
spots,” Muschamp said about his defensive backs. 
“Can’t continue to do the same 
things. … The mistakes we’ve made in some situations back there are inexcusable. It’s on me.

 If Florida’s offense worked like a bat-
tery, then Mackenzie Dagostino would 
surely be the energizer bunny.
And no other player benefits from Da-
gostino’s energy more than freshman Carli Snyder.
“She’s so intense,” Snyder said. “Proba-
bly the most intense setter I’ve ever played with.”
Dagostino’s on-court energy and inten-
sity is only matched by her motivational skills.
“She’s the first person you see after 
you get a kill, like pointing at you and go-ing crazy,” Snyder said. “And that’s really awesome to play with.”
Dagostino transferred to Florida from 
Maryland at the start of her sophomore year, mostly to play closer to her home in Tampa. She immediately established a close bond with then-senior Chloe Mann, 
but not for reasons you might expect.
“I would go to the grocery store… but I 
didn’t want to walk with a bunch of bags so 
Chloe would always pick me up and take 
me to the grocery store,” Dagostino said, laughing. “Or if I just needed someone to 
talk to about missing home, if I was having 
problems in volleyball, Chloe was always 
there for me.”
The relationship between Mann and Da-
gostino originated through Florida’s big sister-little sister program. Before the start 
of each season, an upperclassman reaches 
out to an incoming player to make them feel welcome.
This year it was Dagostino’s turn to play 
the role of the elder.
“I get a text from Mack like three months 
before I came here, and it was like so long,” Snyder said. “I had to stop and read it for like five minutes.”
After hearing Snyder was dealing with 
homesickness, Dagostino immediately identified with the young freshman, just as Mann had identified with her one year 
earlier.
“She’s been really supportive to me and 
it’s really nice on and off the court to have 
that,” Snyder said.
Now, their relationship has transformed 
from an off-court bond to an on-court con-nection. A fair amount of Dagostino’s team-Setter helps freshman adjustfootbALL

 After Alabama mercilessly wore 
down Florida’s front seven with 52 
rushing attempts on Saturday, coach Will Muschamp is beginning to see the toll it took on the Gators’ defense.
Defensive tackle Leon Orr suffered 
a “small tear” in his meniscus in addi-
tion to a bone bruise. 
As a result, the redshirt senior is 
listed as questionable for UF’s match-up against Tennessee on Oct. 4.
“Leon Orr had a (knee) scope on 
Monday,” Muschamp said Wednes-day. 
“He was walking (Tuesday) so 
we’ll see how he continues to prog-ress.”
Orr, who has 14 total tackles in-
cluding two for losses on the season, forced one of the Crimson Tide’s three 
fumbles on Saturday. 
The 6-foot-5, 305-pound defensive 
tackle hasn’t missed a game since sit-
ting out the final four regular-season 
contests of 2012 with an illness.
Linebacker Michael Taylor is also 
listed as questionable after bruising 
his knee, which subsequently caused swelling.
Taylor not only leads his team in 
total tackles along with Antonio Mor-rison, but he also is one of the Gators’ strongest leaders on the defensive 
side of the ball.
Fortunately for 
Florida, the squad 
has a bye week be-fore heading into its 
third Southeastern 
Conference game of the season. 
Muschamp said 
UF’s extra time to 
rest during the weekend should help the two starters’ chances of playing against Tennessee.
Offensive line beginning to re-
cover: Left tackle D.J. Humphries, who left Florida’s season opening win against Eastern Michigan with a chipped ankle bone, should make his return to the field when the team 
heads to Knoxville, Tenn.
Humphries played less than a quar-
ter of football this year before being 
knocked out with the ankle injury.

Will Muschamp
UF Football Coach 
orr
each suffered ankle injuries against Alabama, but 
both players are listed as probable and each will have the bye week to ensure a more deliberate 
healing process.
Muschamp said he still expects to have Rod 
Johnson see playing time on the line despite the 
veterans making a comeback to the field. 
The freshman filled in at right tackle after Green 
moved to left tackle to cover for Humphries.
“We’re going to figure out what our best five 
are, and that’s something we actually discussed Tuesday about where we move from there,” Mus-
champ said. “We need to get D.J. back full speed first, but there’s no question Rod is playing good football for us.”
Another player out for the year: Running back 
Mark Herndon will miss the rest of the season af-
ter his ACL was torn during a kickoff return Sat-urday.
“Disappointed for Mark Herndon,” Muschamp 
said. “(He) was covering a kick there, got his foot caught and got hit on it and turned funny.”
Herndon, whose most notable contribution this 
year came on a 78-yard touchdown reception from Treon Harris in the season opener, was used most-ly on special teams.
Herndon joins Jake McGee, J.C. Jackson and 
Thomas Holley on the Gators’ out-for-the-year 
list.
leading 387 assists are the direct 
result of Snyder’s 76 kills, which are third on the team.
But Snyder isn’t the only play-
er benefiting from Dagostino’s improved play this season. Every hitter on the team, from starting 
junior Simone Antwi to newly 
inserted sophomore Shainah Jo-seph, has developed an on-court connection with Dagostino.
“Because of her playing time 
and her work ethic… you could make an argument in that first month that (Dagostino) is our most improved player,” coach Mary Wise said. “She’s making 
plays from the setter position 
that very few setters … have ever made.
Dagostino stresses the impor-
tance of practice and repetition. 
That’s why she experiences 
success with whomever UF coach-es decide to place on the floor be-
side her.
“It all happens in here, at prac-
tice,” Dagostino said. “It’s the chemistry that we build, every 
single day… And if we have it in here, it doesn’t matter if you’ve never played in the O’Dome, your gonna go in there and you’re gon-
na light it up.”
Dagostino works tirelessly on 
her setting, timing and position-
ing. But what comes naturally is 
her ability to motivate.
“She’s always like, ‘hey you’re 
gonna be beast tonight, you’re 
gonna kill it.’ She’ll like bump into you or something,” Snyder said. 
“She’s really supportive like that. 
It’s nice to have people like that surrounding you all the time.”
Dagostino is aware of the effect 
that she has on her teammates and takes full advantage of her ability to provide confidence boosts.
“It’s all about just finding each 
person’s qualities and then talk-
ing them up. So like (saying) ‘hey, 
you’re gonna have a great game because you’re gonna be doing this, this, and this,” she said. “We 
call it ‘lighting each other up.’”
A fitting phrase for Florida’s 
energizer bunny.

“Haven’t been through this before very often, I can tell you 
that. But extremely frustrating.”
With starting spots open in the secondary, Muschamp said 
players are beginning to feel a sense of urgency.
“It’s the human condition of understanding ‘I’ve got to go out 
there and play well,’ as well as other guys thinking that they’ve 
just got the job,” Muschamp said. 
“You’re always trying to heighten that. Now some guys are 
self-starters, so it doesn’t matter. They’re going to go out and 
work hard every single day, but in most situations, not all, guys need somebody to be pushing them more.”
But with the youth that surrounds the secondary — 
highlighted by true freshmen Duke Dawson, Jalen Tabor and Quincy Wilson — Muschamp said consistency leading up to the game is vital when it’s time for them to step up in a game-time 
situation.
“The issue with young players and — been doing this a long 
time — is in order to gain confidence they gotta practice well,” 
Muschamp said. 
“They gotta practice well on Monday but then they practice 
again well on Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday. And what happens to you as a coach is a guy that’s never been out in front of 90,000 people, he goes out and has five busted assignments in critical situations in a Tuesday practice, what’s he gonna do in 
front of 90,000 people?”
The defensive line has failed to generate an even pass rush.
Outside of Buck linebacker Dante Fowler Jr. and defensive 
lineman Jon Bullard, no UF player has more than two quarterback hurries.
Against Alabama on Saturday, Florida was held to one 
quarterback hurry.
Muschamp wants to see improvements from everyone in his 
front seven, but he specifically mentioned Alex McCalister on 
Monday.
McCalister, who stands at 6-foot-6 and has a 7-foot-2 
wingspan, is tied with Neiron Ball for the team lead in sacks 
with two while working into the defensive line rotation.
“Most of the pressure we’ve been able to generate is with 
five guys rushing,” Muschamp said. “So our four-man pass rush 
needs to improve.”footbALL , from page 14Pass rush inconsistent16, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 25, 2014

If it were their decision, Mark 
Parrish, Eddie Garcia and Jimmy 
Clark would be competing for the 
Gators cross country team this 
season.
But that doesn’t appear to be 
the case.
Parrish exhausted his cross 
country eligibility in 2013, finish-ing his career at Florida with nu-merous records and honors.
Despite not racing for UF, he 
showed that he hasn’t lost a step by winning the Mountain Dew In-vitational on Saturday.
Last year’s South Region Run-
ner of the Year won the 8k as an unattached runner, so his points couldn’t count for the Gators.
Seniors Eddie Garcia and Jim-
my Clark were also missing from 
the team.
Garcia also raced unattached 
and finished third. Clark couldn’t even do that, as he was tending to 
a sore back.
A team that was supposedly 
built around the leadership of its 
veterans is suddenly devoid of 
that veteran leadership.
Coach Paul Spangler says the 
potential role of Garcia and Clark 
on the team is still to be deter-
mined, and will be largely depen-dent on the younger runners.
“I think it really depends on 
how the rest of the team devel-
ops,” Spangler said, referring to 
Garcia’s role on the team. “We just wanted Jimmy to be safe, but we will make a decision as we go 
into (the) Wisconsin (adidas Invi-
tational).”
Florida could have used the se-
niors for its team total, as it had to settle for a second-place finish 
behind winner Georgia Tech. 
If Garcia had run as part of UF’s 
team Saturday, Florida would 
have won the meet with a low 
score of 34 points, while Georgia Tech would have ended the meet 
second with 45 points.
The Gators did not want to lose 
at home, especially when  consid-
ering the team had three runners 
finish in the top-5 that have some form of affiliation with the Flori-da program (Parrish, Garcia and 
freshman Thomas Howell).
For Garcia, the Jacksonville na-
tive still has a year of eligibility re-maining, and it appears that coach 
Paul Spangler still does not know if he will race or not.
Spangler has not given him any 
hints, mainly because he doesn’t know what will happen.
“Coach and I have been talk-
ing, and I still have another year of eligibility,” Garcia said. “Right now we are just waiting to see how things play out, but we will know later.”
Though Spangler could hold 
Garcia out this year, slap on a red-shirt and have Garcia race next season. Spangler may be ques-
tioning that decision after seeing 
several runners underperform in the 8k.
After setting a personal-best 
time of 24:55.40 last year at the 
Southeastern Conference Champi-
onships in Gainesville, sophomore Carlos Miranda was expected to step into a leadership role for a 
young and deep Florida team.
However, Miranda ran nearly 
a minute off that time, finishing in 
25:50.10. 
It was a disappointing perfor-
mance for a runner who showed immediate maturity once he joined the team, competing in all seven races his freshman year and 
being named to the 2013 SEC All-Freshmen Team.
If the team hopes to compete at 
SECs and nationals, they’ll need 
runners like Miranda to step up. 
Otherwise, Spangler might find 
himself rethinking holding Garcia and Clark out.
Clark, who won last year’s 
Mountain Dew Invitational, was also nursing a sore back, accord-ing to Spangler. 
Holding Clark out was just a 
precaution, Spangler said.
But if Clark’s back heals quick-
ly, and Spangler needs to shore up the team’s depth, Garcia and Clark could be called upon to step 
up.
For now, they are just hoping 
to stay in shape and be ready if 
Spangler needs them.
“Training has been going real-
ly well,” Garcia said. “I’m racing this season, making sure I get bet-ter and stay in shape, so we will see where Jimmy and I are at and 
we will be ready.”
