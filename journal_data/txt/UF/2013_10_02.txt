A southeast Gainesville man 
was rushed to the hospital Tues-
day afternoon after a woman found him with a gunshot wound to the chest.
The man was taken to UF 
Health Shands Hospital with life-threatening injuries. Police have not yet released his name. 
Ofﬁ  cers found a handgun but 
are unsure if it was the weapon used in the shooting, said GPD spokesman Ofﬁ  cer Ben Tobias.At about 2:30 p.m., Gainesville 
Police responded to the 1200 block of Southeast Ninth Street after re-ceiving a call about a man bleed-ing from his chest, Tobias said.
Edith Roper, a resident at the 
home where the man was shot, said the man has been living with her for the last two months while he was transitioning out of jail. 
Roper, 79, explained that the 
man was friends with her grand-son.
Just before the shooting, Roper 
said the victim came inside and asked for a knife, then went out-side. She thought he was going to use it to make a sandwich, she said. Then, about 10 minutes later, she heard a pop “like a ﬁ  recrack-er,” she said.
Soon after, Roper’s grand-
daughter-in-law, 30-year-old Ce-lia Kelly, said she went outside to the yard and saw the man on the ground with blood on his chest.
Both Roper and Kelly said they 
didn’t know anyone who could have been responsible. Police are still investigating the incident.VOLUME 108 ISSUE 30 WWW.ALLIGATOR.ORG WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 2, 2013

With the Affordable Care Act effective as of Tuesday, 
some students and health care professionals are encourag-
ing other students to research the information themselves and see how it will affect them.
HealthCare.gov is the ofﬁ  cial website for the health 
care changes, where people can plug in some personal in-formation and see what they may qualify for.
The website is also where the health care marketplace 
is open, the new change that allows people to shop for their health care directly online.
“I strongly encourage students to go to the ofﬁ  cial web-
site or call the 1-800 number, which is open for anyone who needs assistance with their application,” said Kath-erine Lindsey, assistant director for health administration at the Student Health Care Center. “The SHCC itself and our services will not necessarily change. This is primarily about getting Americans insured.”
If the act works as it is intended, there could be beneﬁ  ts 
for young adults. 
Under the law, children remain on their parents’ health 
care plans until they are 26, according to HealthCare.gov.
“This is a major gain for students,” Lauren Nickoloff, 
a 20-year-old UF economics and political science junior, wrote in an email, “especially graduate or professional students, who have either a part-time job or no job and would otherwise not be able to have health insurance.”
Other changes, Lindsey said, include that insurance 
companies will not be able to deny coverage based on a pre-existing condition, there will no longer be a cap on payout claims, and the amount people can pay out of pocket will be more controlled, all starting in January.
However, some UF students said they are sick of the Obamacare 
could benefit young adultsCRIMEMan shot in southeast Gainesville

The ﬁ  rst day of voting yielded a healthy turnout for the 
Fall 2013 Student Government elections.
A total of 6,124 votes were cast Tuesday, an improve-
ment from the ﬁ  rst day of voting in Fall 2012 with 5,860 
votes but a slight drop from Spring 2013’s turnout of 6,274 ballots, according to Alligator archives.
Supervisor of Elections Justin Hoover faced a slight 
road bump Tuesday morning: At about 9 a.m., computers displayed the wrong sample ballot for District D, showing the ballot from last Fall.
Hoover said he contacted the UF Information Technol-
ogy department immediately, and the correct sample bal-lot was posted within an hour.
Afterward, it was smooth sailing.“It’s probably the easiest voting process I’ve ever 
had here at UF,” said family, youth and community sci-ences junior Tyler Redden, 26, who was in and out of the ground-ﬂ  oor computer lab at the Reitz Union.
Today is the last day to vote. Polls will be open from 8:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. at 12 loca-tions. 
Students will need their Gator 1 Card or a valid picture 
ID and UFID number to vote.
Polling locations include Room C202 in the Springs 
Residential Complex, Commons Conference Room 106 in First day of SG elections sees increased voter turnout

Nick Eagle said although the health care

Eagle, a 21-year-old UF economics and po-
litical science junior, wrote in an email that the plan is “a bill that sounds attractive to people, but ultimately is the largest entitlement pro-gram of our generation, which will only lead to out of control costs, ever-growing debt and endless regulations.”

In a move some consider ﬁ  tting 
for a college town, the Gainesville 
City Commission will take a fresh look at the possibility of adding alcoholic options to events held on city property.
The issue — which has been an 
item of discussion at City Com-mission meetings for more than a year — was sparked again by the Gainesville Roller Rebels’ request to sell alcohol at the city-owned Martin Luther King Jr. Multipur-pose Recreation Center.
Under the current system, serv-
ing alcohol at outdoor events on public property goes against a city ordinance, so special approval from the commission is required.
In September, the Public Safety 
Committee discussed a draft of legislation creating a new permit-ting system that would shorten the process of obtaining permission for alcohol-related events.
Miriam Hill, president of the 
women’s roller derby group, said the nonproﬁ  t has always sold beer at events at other locations.
“It boosts our revenues and at-
tracts crowds,” she said.
Not everyone sees the proposed 
changes as beneﬁ  cial.
Gladys Perkins, a member of the 
Porters Community Crime Watch Committee, said she believes the considered change asks too much of the people who live in the area, particularly the families.
She said allowing alcohol in the 
venue would bring it closer to chil-dren, who use the recreation center for sports practices.
“It just boggles my mind that 
someone would even think of do-ing that,” she said.
Perkins sent a letter of protest to 
Mayor Ed Braddy asking that the ordinance prohibiting alcohol stay in effect and explaining the pro-posed changes would insult the surrounding community.
“They are asking the east side 
of town to make sacriﬁ  ces for other people,” Perkins said.
But Hill disagrees.She said her sporting events could be a preventative solution for crime by providing a healthy alternative.
“We try to make our events as 
family-friendly as possible,” she said. “We get a lot of families and a lot of retirees.”
Hill said beer drinking is just 
part of the American sporting cul-ture.
“Americans just want a beer 
with their hot dog,” she said. “We just want to be able to give that person a beer with their conces-sions.”
The potential policy change is 
expected to go to the City Commis-sion for approval soon.

One by one, students inched closer to the Stephen C. 
O’Connell Center to get free tickets to see One Republic 
and TeamMate in concert.
Tickets to the concert, which is sponsored by Student 
Government Productions, went became available two hours earlier than expected and “sold out” a half-hour be-fore the University Box Ofﬁ  ce was supposed to close, said Renee Musson, assistant director of the O’Connell Center.
Tickets went on sale at 10 a.m. and had all been issued  
by 5 p.m., she said.
Daniel Levin, SGP chairman, said the box ofﬁ  ce contact-
ed him to ask if they could release the tickets early because the line was longer than expected.
“That was just logistics,” said the 21-year-old UF indus-
trial and systems engineering senior. “It was kind of an on-the-ﬂ  y call that the O’Dome and I made.”
The Career Showcase also took place at the O’Connell 
Center on Tuesday, and Levin said the University Box Of-ﬁ  ce didn’t want to disturb job-seekers.
Samantha Chambless, a 21-year-old psychology senior, 
said she was upset the box ofﬁ  ce started handing tickets out early.
“They had sold out of the ﬂ  oor seats when I got here,” 
she said.
The concert has been in the works since April, when 
truthLIVE, the organization behind the anti-tobacco Truth campaign, reached out to SGP to have a concert at UF, Levin said.
“We ended up helping them by paying $35,000,” he 
said. “That’s basically for the venue, and we also paid for marketing.”
A total of 5,560 tickets were given out for the concert, 
which is scheduled for Oct. 10 at 7:30 p.m, Musson said.
“We are at the total capacity in the way that the produc-
tion is set up now,” she said. “If they do decide to make some changes, that, of course, will change.”One Republic concert ‘sells out’ with early SGP ticket release

COMPLAINTS ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE.

A new campaign at UF aims 
to prevent sexual discrimina-
tion and harassment on cam-pus.
Paula Varnes Fussell, vice 
president of Human Resource Services for the university, said the campaign’s purpose is to raise awareness about the dan-gers of sexual discrimination for faculty, staff and students.
“This is about making sure 
we have a campus where we can work and learn that’s free of harassment,” Fussell said.
She said the campaign is in 
conjunction with the federal Title IX law, which states that discrimination on the basis of sex is prohibited in any educa-tion program.
Posters adorned with the 
messages “sexual misconduct is never okay” and “recognize, report, prevent” will be placed around campus in dorms, bath-rooms and lecture halls, Fussell said. 
Ongoing seminars on sex-ual discrimination will also be held by UF Title IX coordina-tors throughout campus this month.
She said sexual discrimina-
tion complaints are expected to increase as people become aware of what it is and how to report it.
“This is a new campaign, 
but this is not a new issue of importance for the university,” she said.
Daviel Salgado, an 18-year-
old UF engineering freshman, said he’s unsure if the cam-paign will be enough of a de-terrent.
“Hanging up posters is good 
and all, but I don’t think it will help much for people getting sexually assaulted,” he said.
Elnora Mitchell, UF Title IX 
coordinator and assistant di-rector of equity and diversity, said the university’s efforts are going to continue with each batch of incoming students ev-ery Fall.
She said her team of Title IX 
ofﬁ  cers will monitor for com-plaints and ensure they are responded to and both parties are notiﬁ  ed.
“We will treat all parties in-
volved in any type of complaint equitably and fairly,” she said. “Everybody gets a fair shot at the process.”UF campaign targets

The waves were pumping as 
Mike McVinney, a UF alumnus, 
took home ﬁ  rst place at the 28th Annual UF Surf Club Alumni Surf Challenge.
Matt Novak, 23-year-old UF 
second-year health administration graduate student, came in second.
Novak, a former Surf Club team 
captain, said there was a lot of tal-ent at the meet.
“I wouldn’t say I was happy with second,” he said, “but I’ll take it.”
The challenge between the UF 
Surf Club alumni and the current club was held recently in St. Au-gustine.
“Usually around this time, con-
ditions are ﬂ  at, but this year it was super windy, and the waves were good, so we had a great turnout,” said Jay Leskowyak, 24, UF Surf Club president and horticultural sciences senior.
A record 35 students and 60 alumni competed against each oth-er in the challenge.
At River to Sea Preserve at 
Marineland in Flagler County, there was an after-party with raf-ﬂ  e prizes, including skateboards, longboards, hats, watches and sun-glasses.  
“The Marineland party was 
epic,” said Bobby Sowalsky, 22, UF Surf Club event coordinator and industrial and systems engineering major. “The night ended with dance battles and a huge dance-off.”

Government elections?Congress: 
You better work, 
b***h
The late poet and novelist Charles Bukowski has a quote 
that perfectly sums up our thoughts on Congress’ impasse regarding the continuing resolution.
“We’re all going to die, all of us, what a circus!” Bukowski 
wrote. “That alone should make us love each other but it doesn’t. We are terrorized and ﬂ  attened by trivialities. We are eaten up by nothing.”
The trivialities, in this case, are the GOP’s angry constituents 
that the party continues to cater to, even at the expense of the rest of the country. On Tuesday, the government shut down — duh — because the Republicans keep trying to dismantle parts of the Affordable Care Act, even though HealthCare.gov went live yesterday. The majority of the country has made it clear they support Obamacare, but that didn’t stop conservatives from at-tempting to save face by attempting to pass bills that had no chance of being signed by President Barack Obama.
On Tuesday, lawmakers met, but not much has happened. 
According to The Wall Street Journal, Republicans are criticiz-ing Senate Democrats for being “unwilling to negotiate an end to the standoff,” a standoff which caused furloughs of more than 800,000 federal employees.
According to The Wall Street Journal, “Chris Krueger, a po-
litical analyst at Guggenheim Partners, summed up the situation in a research note on Tuesday: ‘There is no evidence to suggest that the federal government will re-open anytime soon as the various factions in Washington remain at odds with one another and themselves.’”
While essential parts of the government will remain em-
ployed — air trafﬁ  c controllers and law enforcement — a large number of federal activities such as the Internal Revenue Ser-vice audits, surveillance for ﬂ  u outbreaks and national parks operations will be suspended. It’s quite the circus, especially considering that the cost of shutting down and re-opening the government is larger than simply allowing the government to continue running. Everyone is upset about the shutdown, and VICE summed up the crux of everyone’s frustrations:
“It’s stupid that a divided, hopelessly inefﬁ  cient Congress 
has to approve routine spending every couple of months,” VICE contributor Harry Cheadle wrote. “It’s stupid that that Congress can get held up by a few dozen hardliners who represent an an-gry minority and can get automatically reelected thanks to ger-rymandering; it’s stupid that something so self-evidently stupid as the shutdown is happening because a few politicians have no problem putting a dent in the economy and closing national parks to prove something to their stupid f***ing constituents.”
“As the negotiations progressed (or failed to), journalists on 
Capitol Hill reported that members of Congress had smelled like booze,” Cheadle wrote. “Can you blame them? If my job was that stupid, I’d be drinking, too.”
With the debt-ceiling issue looming, Congress — well, most-
ly the GOP — doesn’t have time to waste pandering to a small, angry group of constituents.
So get it together, guys. The National Zoo panda cam de-
pends on it.
‘Pale blue dot’ faces biological extinction
Some years ago, a photograph of our planet was 
taken from a spacecraft hovering at the edge of the solar system. A faint, bluish speck, known as 
Earth, can be seen in the picture. Astronomer Carl Sa-gan commented on the “pale blue dot.”
“On it everyone you love, everyone you know, ev-
eryone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. … The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life.”
Shortly afterward, Sagan had a fascinating debate 
with Ernst Mayr, the legendary biologist. When asked if we will ever ﬁ  nd intelligent beings elsewhere in the universe, Mayr said, “Not likely.”
Mayr reminded scientists that despite billions of bio-
logical species having lived on our planet, “high intel-ligence has originated only once, in human beings.” 
Perhaps “high intelligence is not at all favored by 
natural selection,” as Mayr said.
Earthlings currently have a tool powerful enough 
to destroy all complex life on the planet: the nuclear bomb. 
Even using 5 percent of the global nuclear stockpile 
would render our planet uninhabitable. Nukes have put us on the verge of self-destruction.
On the surface, nothing seems ﬁ  shy about our lead-
ers targeting Iran’s nuclear ambitions, as reducing nukes in the war-torn Middle East would be a crucial step toward a nuclear-free world.
For decades, the world has pushed for a “nuclear-
weapon-free zone” in the Middle East. 
The entire Arab world and even Iran has cooperated 
with the “nuclear-weapon-free zone” proposal. Only one country blocks the path to progress: Israel.
A country that daily commits war crimes against in-
nocent civilians, Israel has a nuclear weapons program so secretive that the plant technician who blew the whistle was drugged and kidnapped from Italy by Is-raeli agents, eventually endur-ing 11 years of solitary conﬁ  ne-ment in Israeli prison.
Here’s a funny thing: We’re 
best buddies. Israel is the lead-ing recipient of U.S. foreign aid. 
Because we’ve got their back, 
the rest of the world can forget 
about forging a peaceful Middle East. 
In the meantime, wouldn’t it be nice to distract the 
American public by focusing on Iran’s nonexistent nukes?
About 45 percent of all operational nuclear warheads 
are held by the U.S. Before “American exceptionalism” creeps in, let’s recall that we’re the only ones to have ever used nukes in a war, killing 135,000 people — mostly civilians — and ruining generations of Japanese lives.
From space, our planet is a dust particle. Earth ap-
pears as a single pixel. All the bloodshed and conﬂ  ict humanity has endured has occurred on that tiny pixel.
Despite most people wanting to respect the fragility 
of that “lonely speck” known as Earth by living in peace with others, world leaders — America’s politicians be-ing no exception — have hijacked humanity’s resources for military and ﬁ  nancial gain, recklessly fueling wars. Life has become endangered.
There is hope. After all, we’re “highintelligence” 
beings. The sooner we realize that rabid patriotism is thinly veiled tribalism, the better. Being critical of our own country’s policies won’t be popular, but who cares about Facebook likes when the species’ survival is in peril?

From 1982 to 2005, CNN’s well-known 
political debate program “Crossﬁ  re” was a centerpiece of American poli-
tics and media. The program featured two co-hosts, one liberal and one conservative, debating against each other and with one or two newsmaking guests — individuals of recent political importance.
Throughout its run, “Crossﬁ  re” was ma-
ligned by critics as a pointless and destructive demon-stration of hyper-partisanship. Viewers of “Crossﬁ  re,” the critics argued, were exposed to a loud and angry debate in which claims were never fact-checked, and both sides ended the program more divided and en-trenched in their beliefs than ever before.
“Crossﬁ  re” met its initial demise in 2004 when co-
median and “The Daily Show” host Jon Stewart ap-peared on the program. Stewart lambasted the format and content of “Crossﬁ  re.”
“You have a responsibility to the public discourse,” 
Stewart said, “and you fail miserably.”
Stewart also said referring to “Crossﬁ  re” as a format 
for constructive political debate was akin to “saying pro wrestling is a show about athletic competition.”
Stewart’s comments resonated with Americans fed 
up with the partisanship of Washington reﬂ  ected in the media, and CNN cancelled “Crossﬁ  re” in 2005.  
Now, after an eight-year hiatus, “Crossﬁ  re” is back 
with a vengeance. Starting on Sept. 9, CNN brought back “Crossﬁ  re” without signiﬁ  cant changes.
The show now features four alternating co-hosts. 
Stephanie Cutter, deputy campaign manager for Presi-dent Barack Obama’s 2012 re-election campaign, and Van Jones, senior fellow at the Center for American Progress and a former adviser to Obama, represent the liberal side of the political spectrum. Conservatives are represented by former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and political commentator S.E. Cupp.
As if the rancorous and counterproductive debates 
featured on “Crossﬁ  re” were not harmful enough by themselves,  the show is now making a mockery of CNN’s own ethics policies.
Before the “Crossﬁ  re” premiere, Rick Davis, CNN’s 
executive vice president of news standards and prac-tices, said Gingrich would be expected to disclose all ﬁ  nancial ties and interests related to guests invited on the show after questions arose concerning Gingrich’s political action committee, American Legacy PAC, which has given tens of thousands of dol-lars in donations to a wide range of conser-vative political candidates.
“If Newt is helping fund a candidate 
and that candidate’s on the show, or being discussed on the show, of course he’ll dis-close that,” Davis said.
Newt Gingrich hosted Sens. Rand Paul 
(R-Ky.) and Ted Cruz (R-Texas) to discuss 
current political issues such as government spending and the economy. 
Gingrich failed to disclose that American Legacy 
had donated thousands of dollars to the campaigns of both candidates.
Rather than reprimand Gingrich for his blatant ethi-
cal violations, CNN instead elected to rewrite its eth-ics policies to completely exempt “Crossﬁ  re” from the transparency that Americans have come to expect from the media.
In a statement released to Media Matters for Amer-
ica, a media watchdog group, Davis made clear that even basic standards of ﬁ  nancial disclosure would not apply to the hosts of “Crossﬁ  re.” 
The statement read:“We are clarifying the policy and making it clear 
Newt Gingrich is not in violation. The policy: If a Crossﬁ  re co-host has made a ﬁ  nancial contribution to a politician who appears on the program or is the focus of the program, disclosure is not required during the show since the co-host’s political support is obvious by his or her point of view expressed on the program.”
Davis’ rationalization of Gingrich’s behavior is 
deeply disturbing and misleading. Political views within both the Republican and Democratic parties are diverse and wide-ranging. His assumption that all liberals and conservatives share complete ideological purity limits the scope of the political debate and al-lows the hosts of “Crossﬁ  re” to promote their ﬁ  nancial interests without any disclosure whatsoever.
Even if “Crossﬁ  re” were not rife with questionable 
ethical practices, its angry and unproductive style of debate would still be a blight on the American political landscape. 
CNN’s abandonment of all standards of disclosure 
for “Crossﬁ  re” sets a dangerous precedent for the rest of the media.

opinions@alligator.orgOn Sept. 5, 2012, then-Senate-candidate Elizabeth 
Warren, during a speech at the Democratic Na-tional Convention, told attentive audience mem-
bers and people watching at home an inconvenient truth. She said the people of the American middle class feel like “the game is rigged against them,” and the truth was that they were right: “The system is rigged.”
Her speech won the hearts of Americans across the na-
tion, and it was roughly two months later that she had won something else: the U.S. Senate race in Massachusetts. 
It didn’t seem to be too long 
before she was in the Senate, ask-ing tough questions to leaders of ﬁ  nancial institutions and ﬁ  ght-ing for the rights of everyday, 
hardworking Americans. It was also not too long before Sen. Warren had become one of my favorite ofﬁ  cials in Washington. My nerdy “favorite people in the Democratic Party” list opened up a spot near the top, a spot right next to Hillary Clinton’s. And even as politics in Washington seemed to get more dysfunctional by the day, Sen. Warren and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still do not cease to inspire me.
It took until my recent watching of the critically ac-
claimed documentary “Miss Representation,” however, before I realized what I needed to take away from my “fa-vorite politicians” list. I could have taken from it the fact that my two biggest role models were women politicians and that it is probably historically remarkable for a college-aged male interested in public service in the United States to say that. But, I did not feel like that was an adequate enough takeaway. So, I sat down and began to think long and hard. I recalled the documentary, the inequalities it revealed and Sen. Warren’s convention speech. I arrived at my takeaway.
There was not just a system in the United States rigged 
against the middle class as Sen. Warren described, but also one clearly rigged against women.
What else can explain the fact that despite the Ameri-
can population being roughly 51 percent women, women representation in Congress is at a dismal 18.3 percent? That’s neither fair, nor is it just coincidence. Despite my two biggest role models being Clinton and Warren, it is still clear to me that the system is rigged to deter women from becoming public-leadership ﬁ  gures. As so eloquent-ly demonstrated in “Miss Representation,” women are still heavily objectiﬁ  ed and degraded through American media and pop culture. This objectiﬁ  cation works toward ensuring leadership is male-dominated by insisting that a woman’s beauty comes from her body and not her mind.
People continue to claim America is becoming more 
equal for women and discrimination based on sex is end-ing. Without discounting the progress made by women’s rights activists over the past century, the fact of the matter is that there is still so much work to do and still so many wrongs to right.
Thinking discrimination based on sex in America is 
over while television commercials and magazine ads con-tinue to display impossible-to-obtain standards of beau-ty for women is quite foolish. This will only ensure the chips remain stacked against future women who dream of representing Americans at the city-, state- or federal-government level. The idea that our country can continue to be a beacon of democracy while women ﬁ  ll less than 25 percent of our country’s representative seats is equally as foolish.
I believe something needs to be done now. There will 
be too many intelligent, qualiﬁ  ed and ambitious young women who decide to pass on public leadership in the fu-ture if we do not change the system right now. This is not an issue for Democrats or an issue for Republicans: This an issue for all Americans in this country who believe in fairness and equality. I believe strongly in the idea that when things get broken, they can almost always be ﬁ  xed, and a problem can only occur if we refuse to admit when something is broken. Let’s admit that we need more wom-en leaders and that we need to end the objectiﬁ  cation of women. Let’s start here at UF by promoting equality and condemning the use of language that objectiﬁ  es.
Just as Sen. Warren has worked to unrig the system 
stacked against the middle class, let’s start unrigging the harmful system against women. There is a distinct urgen-cy that comes with this, and we must start today.

North Central Florida Central Labor Council staff member Jeremiah Tattersall speaks to a group of protesters 
at the office of U.S. Rep. Ted Yoho (R-Fla.) on Tuesday. The group was discussing the government shutdown.

Labor organizations gathered 
outside the office of U.S. Rep. Ted 
Yoho (R-Fla.) on Tuesday after-noon to protest the federal govern-ment shutdown.
Jeremiah Tattersall, a staff 
member at the North Central Flor-ida Central Labor Council, spoke to a group of about 10 people, in-cluding federal workers and com-munity supporters, about shared frustration over the shutdown.
Tattersall said Yoho was not 
acting in favor of the majority be-cause most Americans opposed the shutdown as a solution.
Ruth Browne, an Iraq War vet-
eran, said she identifies herself as a Republican but does not believe a shutdown is the way to fix the problem.“The House and the Senate need 
to find a way to work together. If we come together, there is so much we can do,” Browne said.
Eric Brown, a 20-year-old UF 
political science junior, expressed concern about what will happen to some of the government services some students enjoy.
“Museums and parks will be 
shut down, and I just wish it was for more of a worthy cause than a disagreement in Congress,” he said.
Kat Cammack, Yoho’s chief of 
staff, encouraged the show of en-gagement from residents, which she said is “absolutely critical.”
“The fact is that nobody is in 
favor of a government shutdown, and Ted is working very hard to find a solution,” she said. “There are no right answers for how to deal with the issue.”Labor protests shutdown

� THE REPORT WAS EMAILED 
TO STUDENTS, FACULTY AND STAFF.

More students are being given 
referrals rather than arrests, ac-
cording to the University Police’s Annual Security and Fire Safety Report released Tuesday.
According to the report, the 
number of liquor law violation ar-rests dropped from 156 in 2011 to 88 in 2012. However, the number of referrals given for liquor violations increased from 197 to 260.
The number of drug law viola-
tions arrests also dropped. In 2011, the amount of arrests totaled 174, and in 2012, it was 122. The num-ber of referrals increased from nine to 29.
In 2012, 14 forcible sex offenses 
were reported to University Police, compared to 11 in 2011. In 2012, three hate crimes based on race were reported, and 39 burglary of-fenses were reported, according to the report.
“This year, we did see a few 
more crimes reported, and that’s a good thing,” said UPD Chief Linda Stump. “It’s a good thing that peo-ple feel comfortable in stepping up and reporting them.”
The report was emailed to stu-
dents, faculty and staff, and is also available on the police depart-ment’s website.
The report also includes campus 
security and fire safety policies, crime prevention tips and informa-tion on how to report a crime.Stump said she hopes the re-
port inspires students and faculty to take responsibility for keeping campus safe.
“I think the most important 
thing going forward is to take away all of the proactive educational things that we offer,” Stump said.
She said the small increase in 
reported crimes since last year is a positive indication of the report’s effectiveness.
The report is offered as a down-
loadable PDF.
“We find it very sustainable to 
have it in the PDF form,” Stump said, “and it makes it a little easier for people to get their informa-tion.”
UF public relations junior Al-
anna Massey, 20, said she would be more likely to take advantage of the report in digital form.“Since it’s being emailed to 
students, I definitely think that in-creases their chances of looking at it,” Massey said.
She said she feels that UF’s fa-
cilities seem well-equipped in the event of a fire hazard or crime on campus.
“I think for the outside person 
looking in, you can very quickly see that our campus is a safe environ-ment for everyone,” Stump said.

UF’s Bob Graham Center for Public 
Service is using a $3 million grant to 
create a Knight Fellows in-Residence program starting next month, bringing public and private sector leaders to cam-pus.
The money was awarded in 2010 by 
the Knight Foundation, according to the center’s website.
Preston Haskell, of Haskell, the larg-
est privately held construction company in Florida, will serve as the first fellow, according to a news release.
“It’s an opportunity to get wise coun-
sel, not only academically but from a private sector perspective,” said Shelby Taylor, the communications director for the center.
Haskell will teach a leadership de-
velopment course for the College of Engineering and will guest lecture for the College of Design, Construction and Planning. He will also offer mentoring through the Career Resource Center.
Perry Alfred, 21, a UF building con-
struction junior, said he thinks Haskell’s business expertise will be helpful.
“Anybody in the field of construction 
or even business helps us as construc-tion majors because they can only teach you so much in the books,” Alfred said.Graham Center bringing

Fish food among coral reefs is on the de-
cline, according to a study recently conducted 
by UF researchers, and it could affect the sup-ply of fish meat.
The study, based on fossil records, revealed 
a correlation between the number of coral reefs and the number of decapod crustaceans — in-cluding lobsters, shrimp and crabs.
The decrease in the crustaceans, which are 
a food source for commercially harvested fish, may cause fish populations in coral reefs to die off.
The decline is caused by both natural and 
human-related influences, said Adiël Klomp-maker, the lead author of the study and a Flori-da Museum of Natural History researcher.
The results show a potential threat to the 
supply of seafood in the fishing industry be-cause many of the fish harvested by fisheries rely on the crustaceans in coral reefs for food.
“You see it as kind of a food chain,” Klomp-
maker said. “If you take one part away, it’s go-ing to affect the others.”
Because fossilized fish specimens do not 
preserve well, he noted no studies as of yet show a direct correlation between coral reefs and fish populations.
Sarah Duggins, a 20-year-old UF natural re-
source conservation junior, said the decline in crustaceans could deplete the fish population, which could lead to overfishing.
“Obviously, that’s a negative thing,” she 
said. Less shellfish among coral 
reefs could affect food supply
“You see it as kind of a food 
chain. If you take one part away, it’s 
going to affect the others.”

Every Friday at 3 p.m., “Doctor” Robert 
Ramsthaler gets into his red pickup truck and 
heads to Main Street Bar & Billiards.
He is not there to drink. He’s there for ther-
apy — “billiard therapy.”
“It’s geometry and motion, but it’s also 
an excuse for people to gather and talk about life,” Ramsthaler said. “In Britain, they have teatime. In Mexico, they have siesta time. In America, what do we have? More coffee or another drink.”
For Ramsthaler, billiard therapy is an es-
cape from the daily routine that allows people to learn something in a social setting while en-joying themselves.
“It’s called play pool,” he said. “It’s really 
all just for fun.”
But Jennifer Alonso, a UF Counseling and 
Wellness Center psychologist, said billiard therapy is plausible. She defined therapy as “the act of examining your personal habits and identifying if there are alternative ways to do things that could make your life more healthy.”
Ramsthaler’s groups meet twice a week, 
every week, for no charge to learn how to shoot seemingly impossible shots.
But people often leave with an understand-
ing of things much bigger than winning a game of pool, he said.This has kept Tom Miller, the first official 
patient, coming back for two years. Miller said when the two started playing pool, he’d leave conversations thinking, “Actually, that’s amazing. This stuff should be in a book.”
Miller is now writing that book and still at-
tends nearly every session. The book, to be ti-tled “Billiard Therapy,” will contain about 100 pages of philosophy Miller has collected from Ramsthaler during the therapy sessions.
Miller said many of the ways to handle 
situations in billiards apply to life. In pool, it’s easy to take a shot you know you can sink, Miller said, but you learn to stop and think about whether the shot will leave you with a better opportunity down the road.
Ramsthaler didn’t attend school to be a 
doctor, but he said if “the streets” gave away Ph.D.s, he would have one in billiards.
In the inner-city neighborhood he grew up 
in, he said it was often safer on the streets than in the hallways of his middle school.
He regularly spent all five mornings of the 
school week hiding from truancy officers until the pool hall opened its doors at 11 a.m.
“It was a safe place, and sometimes I’d stay 
until 10 p.m.,” he said. “In the neighborhood I grew up in, the flowers were afraid to come out.”
He said growing up in a ghetto helped him 
learn that much of playing pool is about hav-ing an attitude — something he calls “swag-ger.” He said when you look like you know what you’re doing, you start to believe that, and it becomes true.
Miller walked up to a pool table in the 
smoky front room of Main Street Bar & Bil-liards when Ramsthaler asked, “Dude, what’s with your attitude?
Miller, slightly taken aback, replied, “What 
attitude?”
“Exactly. Get one,” Ramsthaler said. “Now, 
grab a stick, and let’s play a game of pool.”

Sustainable UF is giving stu-
dents and staff the opportunity 
to pick up weekly shares of pro-duce on campus.
Registration is open for the 
Gator Community Supported Agriculture program, returning this fall with three farms for the 2013-2014 growing season, said Stephanie Sims, implementa-tion coordinator with UF’s Of-fice of Sustainability.
Swallowtail Farm, the Fam-
ily Garden Organic Farm and Frog Song Organics are offer-ing about 300 memberships total. Pickups for some of the farms will begin this month, Sims said.
Members pay a lump sum or 
installments to receive a weekly share of fresh produce from a local farm. The fee pays the farmer for production costs.
The cost for a membership 
depends on the farm chosen, length of the season and type of share purchased. On average, an individual share generally ranges from $20 to $25 a week.
Katelynn Smith, a 20-year-
old UF architecture major, knew about CSAs from visiting a town that used the program.
“I think people around here 
would be interested in it,” she said.

at the all-decal lot off Bledsoe Drive near Southwest Recre-ation Center on Thursdays.Produce comes to UFliFEs TylE

When Charlene Ochogo woke 
up from a nap one afternoon, she 
was confused when her boyfriend arrived at her dorm.
She thought he was surprising 
her, but she had texted him saying she needed him to pick her up.
But the 21-year-old UF telecom-
munication senior had no memory of ever pressing send. She had sleep texted. And she’s not alone.
Recently, sleep specialists report  
sleep-texting is becoming more widespread among teenagers and young adults. Phone users will send text messages in their sleep, only to wake up and read conversations they do not remember having.
Dr. Mary Wagner, a UF associate 
professor of pediatrics and sleep spe-cialist, said sleep-texting is a form of parasomnia, which is a category of sleep disorders that includes sleep-walking and night terrors.
She said because the brain is 
still working in sleep, sleep-texting could happen.
Because young people are con-
stantly on their cellphones, it’s not unusual that they could text as if they were awake, she said.
Sleep-texting most likely oc-
curs during stage N3 sleep, which is a deep, slow-brain-wave sleep, she said, and the content in the text messages could even be linked to dreams.
Ochogo uses her phone as an 
alarm clock, so it is near her when she sleeps, allowing her to sleep text.
“I have texted things that are co-
herent or incoherent,” she said.
She said she has sleep texted 
more than once, and it usually hap-pens during after-
noon naps.
Wagner said 
sleep-texting not only disrupts sleep, but it also could mean peo-ple risk sending regrettable mate-rial they would 
never remember.
She said people who sleep text 
should lock their phones before bed and keep phones away from them when they sleep to avoid potentially inappropriate messages.“Young people are really good at 
texting,” she said. “It’s not unusual for that to creep in.”
Jeffrey Reale, a 20-year-old UF 
public relations senior, said he is a serial sleep-texter.
“I’ve texted girls who I shouldn’t 
have,” he said.
Occasionally typing out song lyr-
ics to friends, he said he thinks the texts are sometimes sent as he is fall-ing asleep.
Reale said he’s even had a 30-sec-
ond phone conversation mid-sleep.
“God only knows what I said,” 
he said.

Gators in the NFL
Free agents David Nelson and Jermaine Cunningham 
signed contracts with the New York Jets and San Francisco 49ers, respectively, on Tuesday. Jillian Graff is producing for the Florida soccer team despite playing limited minutes. Read the story on page 16.JOE MORGAN
Alligator Staff Writer @joe_morgan
Several Gators heard their 
phones buzz and ring on Saturday 
morning. 
A text message from offensive 
coordinator Brent Pease read: “Na-ture walk. 1:30. Don’t be late.”
The proposition was nothing 
new for Pease. The Moscow, Idaho, native traditionally took his play-ers on “nature walks” prior to road games in previous jobs.
Saturday’s trek was his ﬁ  rst 
since joining coach Will Mus-champ’s staff at Florida.
“You just go out. You see differ-
ent parts. You talk about things,” Pease said. “Some kids are smart. You never realize that a kid from Florida understands that the bark on a birch tree sheds. A kid from Connecticut did not know that. He did not know there are pine needles that fall off pine trees. He didn’t realize that.”
What qualiﬁ  es Pease to lead 
these educational tours?
“I’m from the Northwest,” 
Pease said. “I like the outdoors.”
And what’s the biggest chal-
lenge?
“They’re like 18-to 21-year-old 
kids. They don’t pay attention at all,” Pease said. “They all have at-tention issues at times.”
Quarterback Tyler Murphy was 
one player who paid attention.
Murphy, who made his ﬁ  rst 
career start in Florida’s 24-7 vic-tory against Kentucky on Saturday night in Lexington, Ky., enjoyed the nature walk. The redshirt ju-nior said the activity cleared his head and relieved some anxiety.
“He knows a lot about nature,” 
Murphy said of Pease. “It’s kind of cool just to learn about differ-ent trees and bushes and stuff like that. It was fun.”
But how well did Murphy pay 
attention?
“What did I learn? Uh, that’s 
awful,” Murphy said Monday. “I learned a bunch of different stuff. I can’t think of anything off the top of my head. You know, I learned a few things about oak trees, saw grass, and just stuff like that.”
Pease assured reporters Tues-
day that Murphy did indeed learn during the nature walk. An out-doorsman like Pease ensured Mur-phy gained knowledge from the experience.
“He learned something. You 
just caught him off guard,” Pease said. “If you would have really given him time to think about it, he would have known that.
“He also learned that you don’t 
venture too far out when you’re doing it on a golf course because Offensive coordinator takes UF quarterbacks on nature walk

Damien Jacobs did not lose just a 
teammate on the practice ﬁ  eld when 
Dominique Easley was injured on Tuesday. 
He lost a friend.Jacobs, who is Easley’s roommate, 
took the senior defensive tackle’s season-ending knee injury especially hard.
“It was a heartbreaker,” Jacobs 
said. “It was probably one of the worst things I’ve been through, just losing him and losing that presence.”
That presence takes more than one 
player to replace. 
Sophomore Jonathan Bullard 
moved inside against Kentucky and played his best game at Florida, coach Will Muschamp said. He worked at defensive tackle during training camp in preparation for a potential injury along the line. 
The work paid 
off. Bullard record-ed three tackles and 1.5 sacks against the Wildcats.

The old guard is out. The new guard is 
in.
Jonathan Bullard and Dante Fowler 
Jr. — if you don’t know those names, write 
them down now. 
With Sharrif Floyd in the NFL, Omar 
Hunter trying to catch on in the pros, Domi-nique Easley out for the season and Ronald Powell at linebacker, Florida’s defensive line is in the hands of those two sophomores.
Bullard and Fowler have progressed from 
touted recruits to forces on the line in one year, and they are only going to get better.
Both players made strong impressions last 
season in limited time.
Fowler made 30 tackles, including 8.5 for 
losses and 2.5 sacks. Bullard had 27 
tackles — ﬁ  ve for a loss — and 1.5 sacks.
All of those stats 
will likely be sur-passed this season.
Bullard has 10 
tackles and already 
reached his sack total from 2012. 
Fowler has six tackles behind the line and 
three sacks.
The Gators need that. Easley missing the rest of the season is not 
a death sentence for Florida’s pass rush and run defense, but it does put UF’s season in the Bullard, Fowler needed to 
anchor ailing defensive line

They will single you out. Pick on you. 
And then cheer when you fail.
When Taylor Brauneis and Taylor Un-
roe stand behind the service line, ball in 
hand, they do not mind being bullies.
“We’re comfortable back there behind 
the line,” Brauneis said. “Serving is deﬁ  -nitely a mental game. Just to be able to pick on certain players, pick on certain passers.”
Each Taylor approaches service runs 
differently, though. 
Unroe’s jump serve, which consistently 
reaches 55 miles per hour, tests the de-fense’s reaction time.
Coach Mary Wise said the junior libero 
has increased her serve’s velocity every season, making Unroe one of the Gators’ favorite go-to point scorers behind the ser-vice line.
“She came to us with the jump serve, 
but it’s gotten faster as the years have gone on,” Wise said. 
“We’re able to score points on her serve, 
whether it’s an ace or keeping the defense on their heels.”
Brauneis attacks opponents with her 
jump ﬂ  oat, which hangs in the air without any spin, similar to how a baseball pitcher throws a knuckleball. 
Similar to a knuckleball, it is difﬁ  cult to 
tell exactly where a serve from Brauneis will end up.
As important as ﬁ  lm on opponents 
is, Unroe said breaking down their own serves with associate coach Dave Boos is where the Gators can make the most im-provements.
“It’s deﬁ  nitely a lot easier now because 
I’m familiar with ... what my body actu-ally feels like when I’m doing something,” Unroe said. 
“Especially on serving because Dave 
will be like, ‘Rotate your hips through the ball.’ 
“Now I know what it means. I know 
what it feels like. I know what it looks like, (and) I know what my serve looks like when it goes over the net, so it’s easier to change something because I actually know what I’m trying to get to.”
This season, Brauneis and Unroe rank 
ﬁ  rst and third in the Southeastern Confer-ence with 0.5 and 0.4 service aces per set, respectively.
Florida averages 1.7 aces per set, which 
is third in the SEC behind Missouri and Mississippi State. 
Boos said serving shifts the balance of 
the match and determines what rotation the Gators use in a tight game.
“Serving is the great equalizer,” Boos 
said. 
“It’s actually a big part of our strategy 
in terms of playing time. “We need to score points (at) every po-
sition to maximize this season. We have to maximize the team with serving. We can’t have any rotation where we’re giv-ing points away.”

four-set victory against Western Michigan on Sept. 14 in the O’Connell Center.
Serving tandem creating headaches for opposing defenses
UF averaging 1.7 aces per setEasley addressed the team before it 
departed for Lexington, Ky. The mes-
sage was simple. Now, with a hard-nosed Razorbacks offense arriving in the The Swamp, there will be plenty of action for the defensive line.
“He just told us just never take any-
thing for granted,” Jacobs said. “Because he never thought that on the Tuesday of practice, that would be his last play in col-lege. He just wanted to tell us to take ad-vantage of every opportunity.”
Jacobs recalled the scene last Tuesday 
afternoon when Florida lost its best inte-rior lineman and emotional leader. 
As Florida turns its focus to Arkansas, 
the pain still lingers.
“He was just in shock. Just mostly in 
shock,” Jacobs said. “He can believe it now, but at first he couldn’t believe it. It was like a dream.”
Kicker burns Gators: Joe Mansour 
captured the envy of kickers everywhere when he outran Ronald Powell and Loucheiz Purifoy to the end zone in Com-monwealth Stadium. The Kentucky kicker caught Florida by surprise with his 25-yard scamper on a fake field goal during the first quarter.
“I was pretty jealous of him, I’m not 
going to lie,” Florida kicker Austin Har-din said. “Every kicker wants to go run a touchdown. We actually — it was funny — I think it was during halftime or after the game all the kickers went up to him and congratulated him and were like, ‘Man, you just lived out our dream.’”
Hardin finds himself in the midst of 
a disappointing start. He has made only four of his seven field goal attempts. 
The redshirt freshman, in his first season 
replacing Caleb Sturgis, missed a 53-yard attempt on Saturday. The kick followed a Florida timeout after the play clock had dwindled too low.
With junior punter Kyle Christy strug-
gling as well, Muschamp put his special teams on notice last week by opening up both starting spots. 
Hardin has the kicking job for now, and 
a former teammate in his corner helping him adjust to the job.
Sturgis, now kicking for the Miami Dol-
phins, visited the Gators before they faced the Hurricanes in Miami. The back-to-back Lou Groza Award finalist has texted Har-din in the early going this season. Sturgis not only imparted knowledge about life in the NFL, he gave Hardin a simple how-to lesson for this season.“His main message is to continue to 
stay confident and calm,” Hardin said. 
“Just take it kick by kick like I’ve been 
doing.”WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 2, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 15
Nature walk helped quarterbacks relax prior to facing Kentucky
the guys sometimes don’t holler, ‘Fore!’ So, we almost got 
hit by golf balls, and then I said, ‘Bad idea. We need to get off of here.’”
Meanwhile, sophomore Matt Jones did not hear good 
reviews. Running backs were not invited, so Jones did not make the trip. 
“I heard it was boring,” Jones said.Perhaps Jones was bitter he didn’t receive an invitation.Pease responded: “Well, you know 
what, how does he know? He wasn’t there. Sometimes, it is boring. 
“It’s like going to class. It’s boring. Prac-
tice is probably boring. But if you just lis-ten to all the knowledge you can gain from 
something out there, it’s not about boring. 
“It’s about how much you learned that 
you didn’t know. It’s kind of like watching ‘Duck Dynasty’. 
“There’s a lot you can learn by watching ‘Duck Dynasty’ that you didn’t know.”
Although Pease doesn’t host nature walks before home 
games, he is open to continuing the tradition when Florida travels to Baton Rouge, La., to play LSU on Oct. 12.
“I think they enjoyed it,” Pease said of the experience. 
“Five of them said thanks. They went in and had some knowledge of things we talked about. 
“I don’t look it as a nature walk as much as we got them 
out of the hotel. They weren’t sitting around. They got their mind right, loosened up a little bit, even talked football a little bit.” Nature , from page 13ryan Jones / alligator

Austin Hardin attempts a field goal during Florida’s 24-7 win against Kentucky on 
Saturday in Lexington, Ky. Hardin has made four of his seven tries this season.
Sophomores have big shoes to fill
intensive care unit.
The offense is average at its best, pitiful 
at its worst. 
The defense has to step up and take over 
games to give Florida a shot against good 
teams.
That was a tall order before Easley suf-
fered his injury. Now, it looks even taller.
But if UF is going to continue to domi-
nate on defense, Bullard and Fowler must lead the unit.
The pairing has the ability to terrorize 
offensive lines. Fowler showed that in the Gators’ last two games.
Against Tennessee on Sept. 21, punter 
Kyle Christy botched a snap, giving the Vol-unteers excellent field position at the Florida 15-yard line. Tennessee was going to score.
Two plays into UT’s drive, Fowler intro-
duced himself to Volunteers running back Rajion Neal, blowing past the right tackle and careening into the halfback. Fowler forced the ball out of Neal’s hands and onto the ground. 
The sophomore reached out and brought 
the ball to his chest, giving Florida posses-sion and inducing a screaming cameo on na-tional television for Tennessee coach Butch Jones.
Jones wanted Fowler flagged for being 
offside, but the sophomore clearly lined up correctly. Don’t worry about getting that wrong, Butch. Fowler is just that good.
Fowler dominated another drive a week 
later in Lexington, Ky.
He blew up two pass plays late in the 
fourth quarter, sacking quarterback Max-well Smith twice in the span of five plays for a combined loss of 18 yards.
Bullard was instrumental in stopping the 
Kentucky defense as well.
The 270-pound lineman filled in at tackle 
in the Gators’ first game without Easley and did an admirable job. He had three tackles and 1.5 sacks for a loss of 9 yards.
Easley won’t be easy to replace. The se-
nior brought energy and talent to the line that is not often seen.
Whether he was dancing between plays, 
rolling around before the snap or pushing the center back 10 feet, Easley made his presence known.  
But if Florida is going to compete for a 
division or conference title this season, they need Bullard and Fowler to fill some big dancing shoes.adam , from page 13

Jillian Graff has proved that she 
does not need to be a starter to score.
The junior forward has not seen 
much playing time — freshman Sa-
vannah Jordan holds the starting for-ward position for the Gators — but Friday she played as if she had been a starter all season.
Coach Becky 
Burleigh substi-tuted Graff into the game for Jor-
dan in the 68th minute against Ole Miss in Oxford, Miss. The Gators were already up 3-1 against the Reb-els and controlled possession in a more physical second half.
Graff increased the lead by an-
other goal.
Outside back Tessa Andujar ran 
up the far ﬂ  ank and saw Graff near the box. Andujar crossed the ball to the middle, but no one controlled it when it entered.
“It bounced around a couple peo-
ple,” Graff said. “I was able to get a hold of it and head it in.”
Graff’s header sealed Florida’s 4-1 
victory against Ole Miss. It was her ﬁ  rst goal this season and the fourth time Florida has scored from a head-er this season.
“It was a relief for me,” Graff said. 
“It was a boost of conﬁ  dence, too. 
“As a forward, you’re supposed to 
score goals, so it felt good to do just that.”
Although the Medina, Ohio, na-
tive has not played much for the Gators, she is experienced at scoring.
During her freshman year, Graff’s 
ﬁ  rst goal for Florida was a game-winner. 
She chipped the ball over Ala-
bama goalkeeper Justine Bernier af-ter being on the ﬁ  eld for only eight minutes. 
Her goal set the momentum for 
the rest of the game en route to a 4-1 Gators victory against the Crimson Tide.
Graff is also familiar with giving 
the Gators a cushion. In 2012, she scored the last goal to ﬁ  nalize a 4-1 win over Georgia.
The junior now has six career 
scores.
Although Graff is seeing limited 
time on the ﬁ  eld for the third year in a row — she only started in two games in both 2011 and 2012 — she makes an impact.
“My role is probably being a good 
asset to come off the bench since I don’t start right now and a big sup-porter for the people that do play,” Graff said.
Burleigh added: “When players 
are called on and they step up, that always gives them more opportu-nity. 
“It’s a great thing when we have 
reserves scoring goals because we know we have some depth that we can count on.”16, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 2, 2013
