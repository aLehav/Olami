A city attorney was arrest-
ed this weekend after he broke 
into a woman’s home while he 
was naked.
Gainesville Police arrested 
Ronald Combs, a senior as-
sistant attorney for the City of 
Gainesville, early Sunday on 
charges of burglary, resisting ofﬁ  cers without violence and loitering/prowling, according 
to a GPD arrest report.
At about 6 a.m., ofﬁ  cers 
responded to a home located 
in the 500 block of Northeast Eighth Avenue after the caller, Marilyn Aileen Wall, told po-lice she awoke to a noise and saw a tall, naked black man standing in her bedroom.
The man ran away as soon 
as he realized she was awake, according to the report. 
Wall, who said she thought 
she may have been dreaming, went to check the back door of her home, which she remem-bered closing before bed. The door was open, according to the report.
She went back to bed, but 
soon heard more noises com-ing from the backyard that s o u n d e d like acorns cracking on 
the deck.  
Officers 
responded and began c h e c k i n g the area, ac-
cording to the report. After a few minutes of searching, an ofﬁ  cer spotted the man — pre-sumed to be Combs — run-ning through backyards across the street, wearing nothing but tennis shoes and a skull cap.
Ofﬁ  cers ordered Combs 
to stop several times, but instead, he kept running through yards, according to the report. Police used a Taser to stop him.
City spokesman Bob 
Woods said city ofﬁ  cials are aware of the incident and are still in the fact-gathering pro-cess. They will decide what to do after they have more infor-mation.
“They’ll take appropriate 
action as the facts may indi-cate,” Woods said.  
Ofﬁ  cers booked Combs 
into the Alachua County Jail at about 7 a.m., where he re-mained Monday evening with a $15,000 bond.City attorney

Hispanic Heritage Month began 
Sunday with a landmark. For the 
ﬁ  rst time, a greater share of Hispanic high school graduates are enrolled in college than that of white gradu-
ates, according to the Pew Research 
Center.
Using U.S. Census Bureau data, 
the center reported 49 percent of young Hispanic high school gradu-ates were enrolled in college in 2012 compared to 47 percent of white non-Hispanic graduates.Despite a drop in overall college 
enrollment in 2012, the number of Hispanic students in college contin-ued to rise.
UF seems to 
be following the 
trend, with a steady increase of Hispanic and Latino students over the past 10 years.
The enroll-
ment of Hispanic 
and Latino students at UF for 2012-
2013 was 17.36 percent, according to Olivia Garcia, the director of the In-
stitute of Hispanic-Latino Cultures.
Garcia said this number has in-
creased from about 14 to 16 percent in previous years.
“I think there is a lot of self-
selection bias,” she said. “The term ‘Hispanic’ is somewhat broad in general.”
Garcia said she thinks more His-
panic students are seeking higher education. She said both population growth and a change in the attitude of Hispanic and Latino cultures are Hispanic college enrollment on the rise

Plans for a new UF president’s house 
are in the works after a $3.5 million dona-tion to the project.
The new house will be named the Das-
burg President’s House, in honor of UF 
alumni and donors John and Mary Lou Dasburg, and it will be built on Village 
Drive. The two-story house is planned to span approximately 5,000 to 6,000 square 
feet and will include modern energy-efﬁ  -
cient technology, according to a news re-lease. 
UF spokesman Steve Orlando said the 
idea to build a new president’s house was in its infancy until the Dasburgs’ donation. More than half of the required funds are now covered, but the search for the remain-ing money is still on. He said all the money for the project will come from private sup-port — none from state tax dollars.
“The house itself is still in its concep-
tual stage. We don’t even have renderings yet,” he said. “But they’re on the drawing board.”
According to the release, the old presi-
dent’s house will undergo renovations and act as an event venue for the university.UF President Bernie Machen has not 
lived in the president’s house since 2006. At a Board of Trustees meeting earlier this year, governance committee members said the house’s inside was dated and didn’t provide much privacy. Donation starts plans for 5,000-square-foot UF president’s house

Alex Payne said he stood 
shocked and upset when he 
saw a hardly eaten burger be-ing thrown away at the Fresh 
Food Company.
The 19-year-old indus-
trial and systems engineering 
freshman said that’s not the only time he has seen large 
amounts of food go to waste 
at dining halls.
But the issue stretches far 
beyond UF’s campus.
The Food and Agriculture 
Organization of the United Nations released a study last 
week reporting that one-third of the world’s food goes to waste.
According to the study, 
food waste takes a toll on the economy, with annual losses of $750 billion.
Jeffrey Brecht, a UF hor-ticultural sciences professor, said portion sizes contribute 
to food waste, and restaurants 
serve more food to consumers because of competition with 
other businesses, particularly 
in the U.S.
“We have such abundant 
food,” he said. “We can af-ford to throw it away.”
He said people should be 
given smaller portions but 
told they can have more, and 
students should buy less food but shop more frequently to 
avoid waste.
“People need to plan bet-
ter,” he said. “Buy just what 
you need.”
The study found food 
waste not only hurts the economy, but it also has det-
rimental effects on the envi-
ronment. Wasted food is the third-largest source of green-
house gas emissions.
But some familiar eating spots are taking action.   
Caitanya Long, vice presi-
dent at the Krishna House, 
said the group does not waste any food.
She said leftover food is 
donated to organizations such as the St. Francis House and the Salvation Army, and some food goes to feed ani-mals.
“We’re reducing waste 
from the start to the end,” she said.
Payne said though he’s not 
immune to letting bits of food go to the trash, he does make an effort to avoid throwing it away.
“I make sure I ﬁ  nish what’s 
on my plate,” he said.Study: One-third of food is wasted

Student Government has found a 
way to make its multimillion dollar 
budget more digestible to students.
Senate Budget and Appropriations 
Chairman Joseph Michaels founded 
“E-nitiative,” a three-step plan aiming 
to educate, elevate and empower stu-dents in the budgeting process.
The ﬁ  rst of two town hall meetings 
within E-nitiative is “Speed Budget-ing,” held in the Grand Ballroom of the Reitz Union from 5 to 6 p.m. today.
The meeting will include how to 
create a budget disk to get on the SG 
budget, read the SG ﬁ  nancial codes 
and understand the 5 percent cut to the 2014-2015 ﬁ  scal year budget.
Michaels also created SG brochures 
and a cartoon presentation for easier understanding.
This year, SG banked an activity and service fee budget of $18,992,000. That money stems from the activity and service fee, which is $17.35, for ev-ery enrolled credit hour. This money is divided among recreational sports, 
student activities and involvement, the 
Reitz Union and SG for allocation to student organizations.
Student Body Treasurer Jayce Vic-
tor saw an opportunity in collaborating with Michaels. As part of his platform when he campaigned in Spring, Victor worked to hold town hall meetings for student groups to increase transpar-
ency.
“Part of holding myself account-
able is knowing where the money is 
going,” he said.
On Sunday, the second town hall 
meeting, the Student Government Fo-rum, will be held in the Rion Ballroom from 8 to 9:30 p.m. Students will be able to voice their concerns and offer 
feedback to SG. Student Body Presi-
dent Christina Bonarrigo and Senate President Lauren Verno will lead the forum.SG to teach budget processBILLY JEAN LOUIS

Florida teachers don’t get paid well, 
said former congresswoman Pat Schroed-
er. Some even qualify for food stamps.
A woman who once ran for president 
and spent 24 years as a U.S. representa-tive for Colorado, Schroeder spoke to about 200 people on Monday at the Bud-
dy & Anne MacKay Auditorium.
She said the federal government does 
not contribute enough money to educa-
tion — it spends 6 percent of its money on education in each state.
“This is critical in our society,” she 
said. 
Schroeder, a Democrat, spent 14 
years as a U.S. representative, according 
to Politico. She considered running for 
president in 1987, but withdrew from the campaign because of a lack of funds and returned to the House of Representatives for another decade, according to a biog-
raphy by Joan A. Lowy. 
When asked how she would handle 
Florida’s educational programs if she 
were president, she said she would cre-
ate more high-tech jobs.
Despite politics being a mess, Schroed-
er said young adults can make a change.“Young adults have to pay attention 
to local, state and federal elections,” her 
husband James said. If there is an issue in their community, he encouraged them to act and call their state representatives  instead of doing nothing.4, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 17, 2013

board announced Friday that its first concert of the year, featur-ing headliner OneRepublic and 
opener TeamMate, will take place  
Oct. 10 at the Stephen C. O’Connell Center.
This concert is a part of the 
truthLIVE concert tour, said Dan-iel Levin, a 21-year-old UF indus-trial and systems engineering se-nior and SGP chairman. 
“They approached us in April 
because they heard about how 
big of a presence SGP has at UF,” Levin said. “UF was chosen out of 
only a handful of schools.”
SGP is sponsoring about $40,000 
of the concert; the rest is covered by truthLIVE, Levin said. 
TruthLIVE is a concert tour sponsored by the anti-smoking 
campaign the truth. Tickets will 
be available for students with 
their Gator 1 Cards on Oct. 1 at the O’Connell Center from noon to 5 p.m., said Levin. He expects about 8,000 students to attend. 
Doors open at 6:30 p.m. and 
opener TeamMate will play at 7:30 p.m.

Summer 2013 was the “coolest” since 2009, 
according to the National Climatic Data Center 
August 2013 Climate Report.
The average temperature in the U.S. from 
June to August was 72.6 degrees Fahrenheit, 
making it the mildest summer in the past four 
years, according to the data.
Florida bucked the national cooldown trend 
in 2013, surpassing last summer’s average tem-perature by 0.3 degrees. This year’s 81.2 degrees Fahrenheit was still cooler than summer 2010 and 2011, which hold the record for the hottest Florida summers since 1998. 
Jeff Huffman, WRUF-TV Meteorologist, 
wrote in an email that the summer 2013 tem-perature in Gainesville was one degree cooler than Gainesville’s average summer tempera-ture over the past 30 years. Huffman said the cooler temperature can be attributed to Gaines-ville’s above-average rainfall. July 2013 was Gainesville’s rainiest ever.
Florida had a total of 29.95 total inches of 
rain this summer.
On a national level, the weather is cooler 
due to a blocking pattern in the north Atlantic, Huffman said. It forces the jet stream, a river of air that steers weather systems, unusually far to the south. Without the jet stream to protect it, cold fronts can surge deep into the U.S. for much of the summer season, Huffman said. 
Huffman said the cooler summer is unlikely 
to foreshadow cooler weather in fall or winter.
“Weather patterns, such as what caused the 
cooler summer in the Eastern U.S., are always changing,” he said. “It’s often difficult to pre-dict their influences on a large scale or over a longer time period.”
Alize Trinquet, a 20-year-old UF criminol-
ogy and anthropology junior, said she had no idea it was even cooler outside.
“The summer felt just as hot and miserable 
as ever,” she said.US has cool

A Newberry woman was arrested early Monday after she 
chased her boyfriend and his ex-girlfriend to a gas station and 
threw food items at them.
Marqusia Antwanette Ross, 23, was arguing with Deme-
atrice Desean Holmes, her boyfriend of two years, because he 
wanted to leave the house to go play cards, according to an 
Alachua County Sheriff’s Office arrest report. He locked the door of the house, and she smashed a couple of the windows. 
Holmes called his ex-girlfriend Destiny Carter to come pick 
him up, and the two left in a gray Nissan, according to the re-port.
Ross got into her green Honda and started driving after them, and she brought her two children along. She pursued the 
Nissan from the La Crosse area through Alachua and onto I-75 
South, according to the report.
Holmes and Carter stopped off at the Kan-
garoo gas station, located at 9303 NW 39th 
Ave., to call police. When Ross chased them inside on foot carrying one of her children, they ran behind the Subway sandwich coun-ter, according to the report.
Ross grabbed bags of chips and a metal 
can opener and threw them at Holmes and Carter, according to the report. Holmes then went outside the store, and Ross followed, 
throwing a plastic bottle full of soda at him.
Deputies arrested her on charges of child abuse without 
great harm and assault with intent to commit a felony. She was taken to the Alachua County Jail, and she was later released.Newberry woman throws chips at boyfriend

A smaller percentage of Hispanic students are earning degrees
reasons for the increase.
Even though the number of Hispanic students at UF has in-
creased, Garcia said it still isn’t enough.
“It’s not completely representational when we look at the 
state population,” she said.
Although more Hispanic students are entering college, a 
smaller percentage is actually earning bachelor’s degrees com-pared to white students, according to Pew Research Center.
Solansh Hernandez, a 20-year-old business and psychology 
junior, has seen Hispanic students and her own family struggle to get through college.
“I have a couple of family members who couldn’t keep up 
with the material because they couldn’t fully understand Eng-lish,” she said.
Hernandez herself has dealt with language barriers and 
discrimination based on her accent. Born in Cuba, she moved to the United States as a child to get a better education. But Hernandez still feels like a minority at a predominantly white university. She said finding a community at the Institute of Hispanic-Latino Cultures has been a key to her success at UF.
“It’s been a home away from home for me,” she said.Despite increased resources for and enrollment of Hispanic 
students, the work isn’t done for Garcia and other advocates. 
“There’s always room for improvement,” she said. “We can 
always do more.”enroLLMent , from page 1nAtIonAL

marketing junior� KRISHNA HOUSE PAID FIVE 
NON-MEMBERS TO WASH PLATES. 
NIKO PIFFERETTI
Alligator Contributing Writer
Reusable metal or plastic uten-
sils can be a cheaper alternative 
to disposable ones, in theory. But Krishna House learned that 
it wasn’t the case when it intro-
duced metal dishes and utensils 
to Krishna Lunch. 
It now serves its vegan meals 
only on paper plates.
Responding to rising food pric-
es, the nonprofit organization cal-culated that metal plates would 
be cheaper than paper plates, all 
else being equal, said Caitanya 
Long, a Hare Krishna devotee.
All else was not equal, how-
ever.
“The amount of money we had 
to pay people to clean the thou-
sand plates was way over bud-
get,” said Long, who has been 
serving Krishna Lunch on the Pla-
za of the Americas for four years.
The 30 devotees who live in 
Krishna House at 214 NW 14th St. prepare, serve and clean up after 
Krishna Lunch in exchange for 
living in the house, Long said.
This year, about 75 percent of 
the live-in devotees are students busy with studying, which cuts down on the house’s dishwash-ing manpower. 
To get the metal plates clean in 
time for the next day’s lunch ser-
vice, Krishna House had to pay 
five non-members to wash them.
Krishna House had also nego-
tiated a discount on trash collec-tion fees with UF administration, 
but it was significantly less than 
expected, Long said. 
“It wasn’t a personal thing,” 
she said of UF’s offer. “UF loves us. The present administration is 
very favorable and have gone out 
of their way to make a really nice 
space for us here in the Plaza.”
Long said they thought using 
metal plates would be cheaper in 
the long run, but some ended up 
in the trash rather than the dish-
washer.
People who didn’t finish their 
meals before the lunch ended at 
1:30 p.m. would throw the plates 
in the trash or walk away with them, Long said.
Replacing lost dishes, cups 
and cutlery might cost more than 
they’re worth, Marie Urmano, 19, 
said. 
“It seems like sustainability 
and the economy are always at odds,” the UF digital arts and sci-
ences freshman said.
Not so, said Leslie Paul Thiele, 
director of sustainability studies in the College of Liberal Arts and 
Sciences.
“Sustainability is said to be built on a three-legged stool,” he said. “One is environmental health, one is social welfare and one is economic viability. For something to be sustainable, it has to be economically viable.”TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 17, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 5

Last week, Florida’s Board 
of Governors approved a $25 
million bond package request for a disability-friendly residence hall.
The request for the bond 
package was previously given the go-ahead from UF’s Board of Trustees. 
All that remains is the decision 
from the governor’s office, which will be announced in October.
In addition to the bonds, the hall 
will be funded with profits from rent, Sharon Blansett, assistant to the associate vice president for student affairs, wrote in an email.
The residence hall is set to be 
built by Fall 2015, she said. 
There are already more than 70 
residence hall spaces in campus housing that are in compliance with American with Disabilities  Act specifications. “The new hall will have 255 
spaces,” Blansett said. “Thirty-five of these spaces can be converted to support students with higher levels of mobility needs.”
Alex Amaro, a 22-year-old UF 
economics junior, thinks the idea of a disability-friendly dorm is great.
“I think it’s progressive,” he 
said. “They’re opening doors for all kinds of students, and I think that’s a good idea.”Disability-friendly housing by Fall 2015>> Number of student bed spaces:  255

educate students 
on consent
To be clear, a number of resources are available to victims of 
sexual assault at UF. According to the University of Flor-
ida Policy on Sexual Assault, victims are encouraged to 
report to the University Police Department’s Special Inves-
tigation Unit, the Gainesville Police or the Alachua County 
Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce, all of which are staffed with professionals 
trained to assist victims.
The UF Ofﬁ  ce of Victim Services provides civilian support 
through the Victim Advocate Program, a conﬁ  dential service 
that ensures victims know their rights and are treated with re-spect and fairness. The UF Counseling & Wellness Center offers conﬁ  dential individual or group counseling for anyone dealing 
with “any form of sexual exploitation.” The services are avail-
able to students at no cost.
Alachua County also has a Victim Services and Rape Crisis 
Center, which provides 24/7 phone support to victims of rape and sexual assault. The hotline number is 352-264-6760.
While it’s commendable both UF and Alachua County offer 
victim services, current campus-rape statistics and the stories of female students who have been raped or sexually assaulted sug-gest a need for a more proactive approach to stopping rape. It’s 
simply not enough to offer women BlueLight apps and tailored 
self-defense courses, especially since the National Institute of Justice reported that about 85 to 90 percent of college women who report sexual assault know their assailants.
According to Psychology Today, college rapists are not 
strangers in the night, as the most common rape myth stipu-lates. One study on personality traits of college rapists revealed that assailants are repeat offenders who see nothing wrong with their behavior and often aren’t caught.
Statistics on Vassar College’s Sexual Assault Violence Pre-
vention page presented more unsettling information: 84 percent of college men who committed rape said what they did wasn’t rape.
The most commonly suggested proactive approach to end-
ing rape culture is implementing consent education.
If UF simply added a sexual-consent workshop during Pre-
view and mandated that fraternities educate their members on sexual consent, perhaps we could see lower rates of rape and 
sexual assault on and around campus. 
Rhiannon Holder, a youth worker for Brook, a sexual-health 
charity in the United Kingdom, told The Guardian that society 
needs to better clarify what informed sexual consent entails.
‘Too often [consent] is viewed as a simple yes or no, and it’s 
much more complex than that,’ says Holder. ‘I don’t think many young people are offered the opportunity to explore all of the factors involved in giving consent: peer pressure, alcohol and drugs, self-esteem, coercion, gender issues.’”
Experts have weighed in, and data doesn’t lie: Moving for-
ward, colleges — including UF — need to engage college men by making sure they know that if a woman is intoxicated, she can’t consent. If a woman is asleep, she can’t consent. And if she doesn’t explicitly say “yes,” she’s not consenting.

Vote or post a message at www.alligator.orgMonday’s question: Will you download 
Chipotle’s game app?Today’s question: Do you like OneRepublic?Dating? ‘Nah, man, we’re just talking’
The college-dating scene seems to be a culture of 
not-quite-caring — an awkward landscape pocked with holes and valleys that trip us up on the way to 
understanding our relationships. Try drafting one text to 
the dime from last weekend. The metaphor will crystallize 
pretty quickly when you ﬁ  nd yourself eight drafts deep and still unsure of what to say.
Dating as we knew it is dead. Experts call our version 
of dating the “hookup culture,” characterized by ﬂ  ippancy and insincerity. Although they’re not certain what caused the change, they believe technology could be the culprit.
We never put all our cards on the table, and we never 
make a real emotional investment. The disconnect intro-duced by technology is manifesting now as a disconnect in feeling.
Dating no longer means dinner and a movie. Instead, 
it’s a cycle of Facebook messages, texts and Snapchat ex-changes that require multiple friends to decode. What started with “let’s not label it” has become a full-ﬂ  edged 
and seemingly permanent change in dating culture.
Today’s “dates” are “one step below a date, and one 
step above a high-ﬁ  ve,” said Shani Silver to The New York 
Times.
Instead of trying a new restaurant together, we ﬁ  re off 
texts on our way out the door with a nonchalant, “Hey, I’m going out if you want to meet up.”
The walls start with the vocabulary. The romantic 
lexicon of our age group consists of irritating phrases like “We’re just talking” and “We’re hanging out.” While these 
things may be true, we talk to and hang out with a myriad 
of people every day.
The way we discuss the people we’re attracted to sets 
them on a plane of equal importance with the majority when, ideally, we’d like to think we make one another feel a little more special. 
Instead, we create confusion about where we stand with 
one another — as if we need help with the insecurity.
The advent of texting, Facebook messaging and the rest has made it somehow taboo to call each other. Now Snapchat has been added to the mix. Bless this hilarious, wonderful app for 
allowing routine ugly picture ex-
changes, but damn it for adding to the haze.
So why is it not cool to care? 
People can openly and unabash-edly obsess over a Netﬂ  ix series, 
but enter an interesting human being and suddenly the raving, obsessive TV fans seem completely ambivalent.
This is not to say we should all declare our burning love 
for one another on the ﬁ  rst date. That will never not be weird. But if we can shout our love of “Game of Thrones” from the rooftops, there is no reason we should be unable to say “I like someone.” Dating someone, which used to be the No. 1 sign of coolness, has instead become a liability to that coolness.
A study commissioned by eHarmony reports that 
since 1995, typical venues for meeting others in person like work, church and social gatherings are on the decline, while the Internet’s role as a meeting place has expanded signiﬁ  cantly. UF students are lucky to attend such a large university, which is one of the last arenas to meet others in person on a regular basis.
Going to college for an MRS isn’t the point — that’s 
as outdated as quitting school to work harvest season on the family farm. Instead of shrugging off our attractions 
and playing cool, let’s put down the smartphones and go 
play miniature golf or something. Stop wasting time with Emojis and try actually emoting instead. 
Dating customs, like chivalry, change over time like 
any other social construct. While chivalry may be dead, it should be our common goal not to let sincerity of emotion follow suit.

On Sept. 17, 1787 the Constitution of the United 
States was signed by 38 delegates during the Con-stitutional Convention in Philadelphia. 
This document outlined how the new country would form 
its federal government after the Articles of the Confederation 
failed. 
The framers set up the Constitution so that each branch 
would have its own functions and its own power. 
Through checks and balances, the branches engage in 
political ﬁ  ghts that ensure the freedom of the individual 
citizen.  
As the country changes, the Constitution also changes. The 
framers knew that the law of the land must change with the 
country. 
The amendments reﬂ  ect the different causes and struggles 
many Americans have fought for. 
The original intention of the document still remains the 
same — the government must protect the rights of the peo-
ple. 
The framers believed our rights came from God, and our 
freedom comes from the Constitution. 
More than 200 years later, our country still stands. 
It has endured two world wars, a crippling civil war 
and countless events that tested the will and resolve of the 
American people.  
I am of the belief that America is an exceptional country. 
Yes, we have the strongest military and the most powerful economy — but that is not what makes this country spe-cial.
Freedom is what makes this country great. It is far too easy as a nation to get on our high horse and 
look down our noses at other countries and cultures. 
There is no doubt our country is the strongest power in 
the world, but that does not mean we are an invincible na-tion. 
We must not take our rights and liberty for granted. The words of Thomas Jefferson still ring true today: “The 
tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.”
The things we take for granted continue to be paid with 
the sacriﬁ  ce of many. 
On Constitution Day, it is important to remember the 
members of our armed forces who have taken the pledge to support and defend the Consti-tution of the United States. That is one of the reasons why we should 
not take our liberty lightly.  
The country’s power comes 
from its propensity and capacity to 
change. 
It is unbelievable to think how 
different we are as a nation now 
from 200 years ago. 
In the past, we fought for independence, civil rights and 
the other problems gripping our nation. We still have more 
problems to solve, but we know that we have the ability to 
solve them together. 
Our country is the most diverse and stable democracy in 
the world.  For that reason we should be proud. 
However, we should not be completely satisﬁ  ed, either.  Our freedoms and constitutionally granted powers en-
sure that the ﬁ  ght for a better America can be fought, and the battle for freedoms can be won.    
We are a special group of people, and we participate in 
this grand democratic experiment. 
Despite the fact that our ancestors came from different 
and diverse faraway countries, we still collectively call our-selves “Americans.” 
This bond inspires hope. In times of trouble we come 
together as a nation. 
In times of great distress — the Challenger disaster, the 
Oklahoma City bombings and 9/11, to name a few — our exceptionalism shines. 
People of different faiths, creeds and colors always come 
together and make sure that the country becomes stronger than ever.      
On this day, it is important to realize how fortunate we 
are to live in a country where we have inalienable rights and freedom. 
Despite all the problems we have yet to face, I believe we 
are still “A City upon a Hill.” I am still and forever will be proud to call myself an American.  
The Constitution makes our country strong. Our free-
dom makes us exceptional. We make the world hope.

Voice your opinion with the Swamp Party
After a rigorous three-day selection process, 
Swamp Party is proud to present a full slate of 
50 Senate candidates after a record-breaking 
number of students interviewed to become stu-dent representatives.
Among the 674 students that interviewed to 
become candidates, 82 percent chose to inter-view with the Swamp Party.
With a record turnout of more than 550 in-
terviewees, the party had an 11 percent candi-
date acceptance rate, ensuring that the party put 
forth the most well qualiﬁ  ed, experienced and diverse group of student representatives pos-
sible.
Swamp Party successfully completed its ﬁ  rst 
day of platform generation yesterday as well. 
As a party that directly generates a platform 
for the students by the students, Swamp Party spent the day in Turlington and the Reitz Union 
asking students what they want their represen-
tatives to accomplish in the following year. 
Tomorrow you can ﬁ  nd our candidates out 
there again! We encourage you to voice your opinion and inﬂ  uence our party’s decisions! 
Thank you for your continued support and

Special thanks to UF’s Indian Students 
Association
I am a 2005 graduate of UF and a proud 
Gator. As a former member of the Student Sen-
ate, a former ofﬁ  cer of the Indian Students As-
sociation, an honors ambassador and a member of Savant UF, I recall organizing and participat-
ing in many activities on and off campus to raise awareness of issues we believed needed atten-
tion.
Today, I’m pleased to see how UF student 
organizations continue to contribute to solve is-
sues of importance.
Speciﬁ  cally, I’m referring to the exceptional 
commitment of the UF ISA Organization to 
solve an issue, which I believe deserves public 
recognition. They pledged to increase the num-
ber of potential bone marrow donors of Indian 
descent. This mission has personal signiﬁ  cance for me because my uncle, Himanshu, was re-
cently diagnosed with a condition that requires 
a bone marrow transplant.
Among the approximately 3.1 million people 
of Indian descent living in the U.S., his potential 
donor would have to be between the ages of 18 
and 44, in good health and be compatible with 
his marrow type.
Unfortunately, the discouragingly low num-
bers of South Asians registered as potential do-nors limit the probability of ﬁ  nding a donor.
The admirable efforts of Riffat Bhimani and 
Neha Swaroop, president and external affairs 
vice president of ISA, along with Mauricio 
Murillo of the Icla da Silva Foundation, led to 
a donor drive to coincide with the ﬁ  rst ISA gen-
eral body meeting of the fall term.
Their efforts and leadership resulted in reg-
istering more than 75 donors! This is one of the 
most successful donation drives sponsored on 
behalf of my uncle, and my family couldn’t be 
more grateful and honored by not only the stu-dents’ willingness to help organize the event, 
but also by their eagerness to register with the 
national database to solve a speciﬁ  c issue that 
touches so many families. It is truly a humbling 
feeling.
While I haven’t been able to come back to 
Gainesville as often as I would like, I’m pleased to see that our students remain exceptional.
Go Gators!

PERCENT.

Remarriages are down, and 
shacking up could go up across the 
U.S. A recent analysis of federal data conducted by the National Center For Family & Marriage Re-
search showed that between 1990 
and 2011, remarriage rates dropped by 40 percent. Remarriage by di-vorced or widowed people now oc-curs at a rate of about 2.9 percent, down from 5 percent.
This change could be due to 
couples feeling less pressure to marry, said UF sociology professor 
Tanya Korepeckyj-Cox. She said 
the data shift shows how the coun-try has changed in terms of values and stigmas.
“There are more options for people, so it’s become easier and more straightforward for people to live on their own,” she said. “So, 
there isn’t a pressure to get remar-
ried. And depending on their prior experience, they may be hesitant to get into another marriage.” 
Younger age groups had the 
most dramatic change, with the rate dropping about 54 percent in the last two decades. 
For divorced or widowed peo-
ple who have found a new partner, Korepeckyj-Cox said many may be choosing to take the commitment just as far as living together. In the past, this wasn’t the case with a more religious culture deeming co-habitation as “living in sin.”
“Not only is it not a stigma, but 
it’s become pretty widely accepted 
that people can live with a partner 
without getting married,” she said.
Korepeckyj-Cox said living to-
gether is usually a step toward marriage, though for a small group, it will be the only step toward life-long commitment.
For Kyle Smierciak, a 28-year-
old Santa Fe accounting sopho-more who lives with his ﬁ  ancee, the choice to move in together was a no-brainer. 
“You need to ﬁ  gure out what 
works best for both of you so you both feel comfortable,” he said. “When you’re married, there’s no getting out unless you go through 
divorce.” 
Involving children can compli-
cate the marriage situation, said 
Korepeckyj-Cox.
Danielle Boykin, a married 
20-year-old Santa Fe psychology sophomore, agreed.
She and Smierciak said their 
marriage values were inﬂ  uenced 
by their parents’ relationships.
“I didn’t want to get married 
multiple times,” Boykin said, “So I 
feel like I considered it very heav-ily.”8, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 17, 2013

A new supplement set to hit 
college campuses is being mar-
keted as a legal replacement for illegal prescription drug use.
Described as a “brain sup-
plement,” Cerebral Success ad-vertises six hours of naturally enhanced cognitive function —  an alternative to the prescrip-tion stimulants students often take in an attempt to study.
“Cerebral Success gives you 
focus and energy, but in addi-tion, it gives you heightened 
memory and health beneﬁ  ts in 
the form of Omega-3 DHA and antioxidants,” said CEO Trevor Hiltbrand.
In a recent survey conducted 
by UF and Washington Univer-sity in St. Louis, two-thirds of people surveyed reported they believed the use of prescription 
stimulants is a moderate-to-
large problem among young adults. 
The report found nearly 12 
percent of the surveyed group had diverted medication either by supplying others with stim-ulants or by taking someone else’s medications. 
UF epidemiology Ph.D. 
student Sonam Lasopa co-au-thored the study. 
“These drugs are to be used 
under supervision of a medical professional and are intended for use in those with [attention] problems,” Lasopa wrote in an email. 
According to the National 
Institute on Drug Abuse, the unauthorized use of prescrip-tion stimulants including Ad-derall, Ritalin and Concerta can lead to an increase in blood 
pressure and heart rate as well 
as a decrease in sleep and ap-petite. Repeated use can lead to cardiovascular concerns and addiction. 
But 19-year-old UF public 
relations sophomore Josh Fer-rari understands the lingering attraction to stimulants. 
“Students put a lot on the 
line to have a successful run in college, so I don’t doubt that a lot of people use them to help them focus,” Ferrari said. “If there was a legal alternative, I would probably want to try it.” 
Hiltbrand, who graduated 
from Brigham Young Univer-
sity in 2011, began developing 
the alternative supplement for himself while in college. 
“I always struggled to focus 
on studying, so I started trying to mix different natural supple-ments. People started to notice and would come knocking on my door asking for some,” Hilt-
brand said. “That was when I 
knew I had a product.” 
Hiltbrand recently began 
raising funds through Indiego-go to take the product, which can now be found online, to physical east-coast university towns. 
The amount of money raised 
will determine how soon UF students see Cerebral Success in stores near campus. 
Hiltbrand also recommends 
that when taking his product, students stay hydrated and maintain recommended levels of nutrients.Supplement looks

Car collision rates are increasing at 
Northwest 39th Avenue and Northwest 
34th Street, and although some residents 
say traffic signals are to blame, city officials 
are citing other reasons for the problem.
A resident filed a complaint with the 
City Manager’s Office at the end of August 
claiming the traffic light on Northwest 39th 
Avenue remained green for too long, result-ing in cars on Northwest 34th Street running red lights and causing collisions.
Though the Public Works Department 
dispatched a technician to check the signal and found it was working properly, they still adjusted the detector to ensure all cars were being detected as they approached the 
light. 
Despite the change, collisions are still oc-
curring.
Traffic Operations Manager Matt Weis-
man said the accidents are due to over-con-gestion in the area, and changing the length 
of traffic signals won’t help solve the prob-lem.
“The only thing we can do as far as traffic 
signals is operate it the best we can,” he said. “But at this point when there’s more traffic than the intersection can handle, there’s not much more that can be done on our end.”
The intersection is overseen by the Flor-
ida Department of Transportation. Howev-
er, it subcontracts the City of Gainesville to 
operate the intersection. 
City Commissioner Thomas Hawkins 
said the city maintains all the traffic signals 
in the county and is motivated to remedy 
the issue because it’s responsible for pro-viding emergency medical services as a re-sult of the collisions.
“We’re the primary source for public 
safety, so we care from that perspective be-cause we are the first responders,” he said.
Weisman suggested alternative solutions 
to the crash issue, such as utilizing the bus system and widening the roads.
However, some residents think the city 
should come up with a different solution to solve the problem.
Tara Richardson, owner of Weecycle, lo-
cated at 5110 NW 34th Blvd., said in the 12 
years she has been operating the consign-
ment shop at the location, she has seen at least one serious collision a month at the intersection.
“When I say major, I mean cars are 
flipped over,” she said. “Two months ago, there was a double accident on that road, one going north and one going south.”
Richardson said while changing traffic 
patterns could help, widening the roads 
and doing other construction could possi-bly make the accidents worse.
“It’s already two lanes both directions,” 
she said. “I think construction will cause 
more problems than what’s already hap-
pening.”

The George A. Smathers 
Libraries’ Government 
Documents department will be hosting its fourth annual Celebration of the Consti-
tution today from noon to 
1 p.m. on the Plaza of the Americas.
The celebration will in-
clude a public forum where students and staff members can share a reading of the Constitution, said UF librar-ian Chelsea Dinsmore.
“Our founding docu-
ments are freely available for everyone to read, which isn’t the case in many coun-tries,” she said.
The library will also dis-
tribute 1,000 pocket-sized Constitutions on campus, she said. Cards offering Con-
stitution apps will be distrib-
uted on Tuesday as well.
The Celebration of the 
Constitution is a national event, and all schools that receive federal funding are required to participate, Din-smore said. 
In addition to the Consti-
tution reading on the Plaza of the Americas, the Bob Graham Center for Public Service will record a video segment called “Preambling with Dr. Emma Humphries.” Humphries, the Bob Gra-ham Center’s assistant in citizenship, plans to mean-der through campus asking 
random students questions 
about the Constitution. The idea came from a spin-off of Jay Leno’s late-night seg-ment “Jaywalking”.
“When it comes to know-
ing the framework of our government, we don’t really teach it,” Humphries said. “I 
have a hunch that the ma-
jority of UF students won’t know the answers.”
The importance of this 
event is to learn about why the Constitution matters and why the day is meaningful, Humphries said.
Students can earn $5 
Starbucks gift cards for each question they answer cor-
rectly, and they can earn up 
to three gift cards.

This past weekend, “The Little 
Mermaid” hit the big — and now the 
little — screen. 
The 1989 classic was re-released as 
“Disney Second Screen Live: The Little 
Mermaid” in some theaters bundled 
with an interactive iPad app.
Playing nautical games, compet-
ing with other audience members and participating in a group singalong on the Apple product provide interaction between big screen and moviegoers.
Bruce Floyd, UF’s social media 
specialist, said customers may accept 
the concept if they come in expecting 
bright lights.“A movie theater, in a general sense, 
should not be a place for glowing phones and other devices’ screens,” he said. “But a unique experience like this 
where people are informed of technol-
ogy being used and they choose to go there … there’s no problem with it.”
Michael Condra, a 23-year-old UF 
history junior, said he would never like to sit in for an interactive thematic experience.
“I think it would be a distraction,” 
he said. “When someone receives a text or a call and their screen lights up in a regular movie showing I get an-noyed.”
Lyndsey Peck, a 21-year-old UF po-
litical science senior, felt similarly.
“This is depriving kids of the abil-
ity to enjoy movies the way my gen-eration did,” she said. “The movies should be a family event.”
Floyd said he expects the concept 
to take off.
“I think that with the multiplexes 
that we have, and the summer wind-ing down, theaters are looking for any 
opportunity they can to bring in cus-

The home of never-ending soup and salad is aiming 
to attract more millennial customers with tapas. 
Olive Garden wants to bring in more millennial cus-
tomers, said Tara Gray, a media relations worker for the 
restaurant. This is a change of pace for the mega-chain, which usually caters to diners looking for large portions at low prices. 
“During our tests, we’ve seen millennial guests en-
joying a combination of small plates as a new meal occa-sion between lunch and dinner,” she wrote in an email. “We’ve also seen families ordering a variety of small plates with dinner as a way to explore and share new 
tastes together.”
Some of the new dishes include parmesan-roasted 
asparagus, crispy risotto bites and grilled chicken spie-
dini. Prices for each are about $4, Gray said. Three more 
dishes will debut in December. “We believe ‘Tastes of Italy’ small plates will cre-
ate new dining occasions and reach new guests,” Gray 
said. 
UF student Nick Gomez, a 19-year-old mechanical 
engineering sophomore, said he’s excited about the idea because it works with his busy schedule.
“I know I don’t really eat three big meals a day any-
more,” he said. “I like to space it out with little meals along the day because I’m on the go.”
Gomez said although he and his friends don’t par-
ticularly enjoy Olive Garden, the idea of new menu of-
ferings could be enough to reel him in.
“As long as they keep their old stuff along with the 
new stuff, they could definitely get more customers,” he 
added. “Especially because it’s cheaper, which college 
kids love.”Olive Garden tailoring menu for millenials“I think that with the

Havana Solaun is no stranger to 
comebacks.
When the Gators are down, Solaun 
often finds a way to get UF back in the 
game. 
She scored the game-winning 
goal in Florida’s 2-1 overtime victory against Arkansas in 2011. 
She was the playmaker on an 
equalizer in last season’s 3-2 win 
against New Mexico and was just shy of finding the back of the net in a scoreless double-overtime match against North Carolina in 2012. 
Solaun found the right touch to 
halt a South Florida win on Sunday. 
The junior midfielder posted a 
74th-minute equalizer in a 1-1 double 
overtime draw against USF. 
The Bulls led 1-0 through about 68 
minutes of playing time after Sharla 
Passariello opened the scoring in the 
7th minute. Solaun’s goal was her fourth this 
season and the 17th in her career.
“[Defender Claire Falknor] did a 
great job working it down the line,” 
Solaun said. 
“Everyone already in the box pret-
ty much set it up for me.
“There was run 
near post, which drew all their de-fenders. The ball 
went straight across the goal. 
“Caroline (Triglia) said ‘I thought 
about hitting it, but I stopped and let it go through my legs.’ Had she not have done that, we wouldn’t have scored.”
Despite missing on an opportunity 
with 30 seconds left to escape Tampa with a win, Solaun’s efforts on the 
field gave the No. 9 Gators (6-1-1) 
their first draw of the season.
Coach Becky Burleigh said So-
laun’s goal was due in part to the Junior midfielder showing 
timely touch for FloridaFootball

It may have nine stanzas, but the good 
‘ole song from Rocky Top has a catchy ring 
to it. In Knoxville, Tenn., it’s a touching ren-
dition to the simple life in the foothills. In 
many other places, “Rocky Top,” is an an-noying battle cry that people would rather do without.
Gators senior defensive tackle Dominique 
Easley has an interesting way to deal with Tennessee’s theme song: He sings it himself.
“They hear me,” Easley said. “I don’t 
know if they consider it a taunt, but I just do 
it for my own enjoyment.”
Easley does not shy away from having fun 
on the football field. For him and nine other 
seniors, Saturday marks the last matchup in their careers against the Volunteers (2-
1).  No. 19 Florida (1-1) attempts its ninth-
straight victory in the series at 3:30 p.m. in The Swamp.
In his three previous Tennessee-Florida 
games, Easley recorded three tackles, two of 
which went for a loss, and two quarterback 
hurries. Florida defeated Tennessee 37-20 last season at Neyland Stadium on the heels of an 80-yard touchdown run from Trey Burton and a 75-yard touchdown catch by Frankie Hammond Jr.
Florida quieted the band with 24 unan-
swered points. Senior defensive back Jaylen Watkins picked up a tackle in the 2012 vic-tory. He won’t miss the tune of “Rocky Top,” 
either.
“It’s bittersweet,” Wat-
kins said. “Obviously, I’ve enjoyed my time here, but all of us hate the Rocky Top. It’ll be good to not 
hear it anymore.”
Driskel ready despite 
sprained knee: A knee in-
jury was the last thing on Jeff Driskel’s mind. The quarterback and his team were on the 
ropes in a raucous away atmosphere at Mi-ami. Florida, down 14-6 at halftime, never recovered.
Driskel, meanwhile, had perhaps his 
worst game as a starter, committing three turnovers — two of which were intercep-tions thrown in the red zone. All of this hap-pened on a sprained left knee. The school an-Defensive tackle preparing for

Matt Jones has not felt this good 
in months. 
After suffering a serious viral infec-
tion in July, which caused him to miss 
all of fall camp and Florida’s season 
opener against Toledo on Aug. 31, 
Jones said Monday he is as close to be-ing fully healthy as he has been since 
spring. 
“It was this bye week, start-
ing Monday,” Jones said of when 
he started to feel normal. “I went 
through practice feeling good, mak-ing the right cuts, making one cut 
that I usually make. Monday through 
Friday was the best practice I’ve had so far.”
Said coach Will Muschamp: “He 
had a really good off week. I think he worked extremely hard. … Coming 
off for him, the issues he had medi-
cally, I feel good about where he is right now.”
Jones returned against Miami on 
Sept. 7 but was limited throughout the Gators’ 21-16 loss to the Hurri-
canes in Sun Life Stadium. 
The sophomore tailback carried the ball 18 times, grinding out 47 
yards and fumbling on the opening drive of the game. 
In addition to not feeling great 
physically, Jones wondered internal-ly if he had returned too soon.
“I was thinking I wasn’t ready to 
come back,” Jones said. “I was think-ing I wasn’t going to be back. My 
coaches just told me to calm down 
and trust yourself. Through the third or fourth quarter, I started feeling 
comfortable.”
Despite having a debut to forget, 
Jones said he was glad to have gone through a full game prior to the start 
of Southeastern Conference play. Jones ready to carry load

   Entering the 2013-14 season, 
coach Gregg Troy has one of the 
most impressive Florida teams to date. 
  UF lost just two scoring swim-
mers from last year’s NCAA 
Championships, making for an 
easy transition. 
  Florida returns 11 All-Ameri-
cans on the men’s team, includ-
ing Olympians Marcin Cieslak and Sebastien Rousseau, senior 
Brad deBorde and juniors Dan 
Wallace and Eduardo Solaeche-Gomez. 
With so much 
returning tal-ent, the Gators 
are not only 
thinking about a repeat perfor-mance as South-eastern Confer-ence champions 
— a feat Florida men’s swimming had not accomplished in 20 years prior to last season — but success 
at the NCAA Championships as 
well.
  “They took big pride in win-
ning that last year. I think that we may have a target on us at the moment,” Troy said. 
“We fell a little short. We 
thought we should have been 
third at the NCAA meet last 
year.”
  Troy reiterated those feelings 
for the women’s team, which du-plicated the men’s sixth-place ﬁ  n-ish at the NCAA Championships in 2013.
  The women’s team has ﬁ  re-
power in two-time Olympian and All-American senior Elizabeth 
Beisel.
  “[She] can swim everything,” 
Troy said. “She’s real easygoing, 
so she’s intense about her racing, but she’s kind of fun to be around at practice. She makes other peo-ple better.”
  The women’s team is not 
as top heavy as the men’s. The 
women sport a strong sophomore 
class comprised of 12 swimmers, 
including ﬁ  ve All-Americans.
  “They improved tremendous-
ly and had good summer,” Troy 
said. “Natalie Hinds (and) Sinead Russell were fantastic.”
  Troy also said senior Alicia 
Mathieu had a breakout sum-
mer.
  The freshmen for both squads 
sport talent as well.

No. 19 Florida (1-1) faces Tennessee 
(2-1) on Saturday at 3:30 p.m. in Ben Hill 
Griffin Stadium.
“It was a good thing for me to come 
back against Miami,” Jones said. “Get-ting used to the game. I needed to feel 
hits and how the speed of the game changed and stuff like that.”
Returning to full speed proved more challenging than even Jones expected it to be when he first became ill in July. 
The Seffner native spent “seven or eight 
days” in the hospital and lost “10-12 pounds” throughout the process. 
Headaches and nausea continued to 
delay and frustrate Jones, who expected to enter the season as Florida’s work-
horse. Jones enjoyed a successful fresh-
man season that saw him carry the ball 52 times for 275 yards and three touch-
downs while backing up Mike Gillislee in 2012. 
“It was definitely hard. I put all that 
work in,” Jones said. “That’s the thing 
with football — sometimes you can have a downfall. You don’t know when you 
can get hurt. It’s how you overcome it 
and how you come back.” 
Jones is still not back at his normal 
playing weight of 226 pounds. 
He said he currently weighs 224 
pounds but is confident he will finally 
be able to shoulder the full load asked of him. 
For a Florida offense that has aver-
aged only 192 rushing yards through 
two games — the third-lowest clip in the SEC — a healthy Jones will be an impor-
tant addition. 
“I definitely have big expectations,” 
Jones said. 
“I want to take the team on my back 
now that I’m back and I feel I know how 
the game feels now. I have big expecta-
tions going into this game.”TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 17, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 15

Savannah Jordan battles for the ball during Florida’s 2-0 win against Minnesota on Fri -
day in James G. Pressly Stadium. Jordan has three multi-goal matches this season.
Gators nearing start of SEC 
play, host Alabama on Friday
Bulls’ defense targeting freshman forward 
Savannah Jordan.
“We’re a tough matchup for a lot of 
teams,” Burleigh said. 
“The reason is we have some diversity 
in our attack and we also have some play-makers. It’s hard to focus on one player. USF did that a little bit [Sunday], really trying to double team Savannah a lot and 
that left an opening for Havana to get a 
goal.”
Burleigh also noted that the fouls UF accumulated during the contest hindered the team’s rhythm. 
Florida and South Florida combined to 
rack up 39 fouls in the match’s 110 min-
utes.
With a 2013 schedule that showcases 
new opponents from across the country, 
Burleigh said the diverse styles of play that UF has gone up against has helped 
the Gators prepare for when Southeastern 
Conference play opens up this weekend.
Florida hosts Alabama on Friday night 
at 7 at James G. Pressly Stadium.
With the 20 shots Florida took on USF’s 
goal Sunday and only getting one to the back of the net, executing finishes will be on the team’s mind for Friday’s matchup.
“For us, it is kind of a separate season 
because what we’ve done up to this point is only preparation for the SEC,” Burleigh said. 
“Starting Friday, everyone’s starting 
over again.”Soccer , from page 13

Jaylen Watkins runs down the field during Florida’s 21-16 loss against Miami on 
Sept. 7 in Sun Life Stadium. Watkins is now starting at safety for the Gators.
Watkins now starting at safety
nounced the injury via Twitter on Sept. 9.
“A lot of adrenaline going during the 
game,” the junior said Monday. “I felt it, but 
not as much as I did after the game. I don’t 
think it affected me at all.”
A bye week could not have come at a 
better time for UF. When Florida kicks off against Tennessee, it will be 13 days since he last played a football game. The injury 
occurred during one of his nine rushing at-
tempts.
“It was in the second quarter. It got high-
lowed, (and) got stuck in the ground a little 
bit,” he said. “It could have been a lot worse, 
so that’s the good news. It’s feeling a lot bet-ter now and I’ll be ready to go.”
Gators update depth chart: Despite hav-
ing the nation’s third-ranked defense, coach Will Muschamp wasn’t pleased with the per-formance against Miami. The Gators held a potent Hurricanes offense to 1.8 yards per 
rush and 162 yards passing.
Receiver Phillip Dorsett beat starting 
strong safety Marcus Maye on a 52-yard 
touchdown catch in the first quarter for the 
game’s lone big play. 
The redshirt freshman defensive back 
was listed behind Watkins in the latest depth 
chart released by Florida on Monday.
“You just can’t give up big plays. We can’t afford that to happen,” Muschamp 
said. 
“You’ve got to tackle better. Marcus 
knows that. Jaylen’s played well at safety for 
us. He will still play some corner, but he’s a guy that covers well. This will be mostly a 
sub game in nickel and dime personnel, so 
we need to be in some situations where we get our best cover people on the field.”
Maye is listed as the first-team dime de-
fensive back. Middle linebacker Antonio Morrison moves into the starting spot after backing up Michael Taylor in Week 2. De-fensive back Loucheiz Purifoy will return 
kicks with Solomon Patton on the kickoff 
unit.
Right guard Jon Halapio makes his first 
start after missing the first two games with a pectoral injury. 
Right tackle Tyler Moore remains the 
starter despite suffering a right ankle injury in Miami. Muschamp said Moore would’ve been the only player not able to go if Florida 
played last week.notebooK , from page 13

UF coachcome in that we feel like can con-
tribute right away,” Troy said.
  Troy is excited about  Andrea 
(Mitch) D’Arrigo, who he be-
lieves can come in and make an 
immediate impact.
  “I feel like he can play,” Troy 
said.
  Troy mentioned that as an in-
ternational swimmer from Italy, D’Arrigo’s speed will have to translate from long-course me-ters to short-course yards, which Troy called “a little different an-imal.” 
  “There’s a lot of room to make 
up for mistakes in a 50-meter 
pool,” Troy said. “In a 25-yard 
pool, there’s a little less room for 
error.”
“So he’s going to have to im-
prove in some of those areas, but 
certainly has the tools.”
  Troy is looking forward to 
the ﬁ  rst meet of the year, a three-day Pinch A Penny All Florida Invitational beginning on Sept. 
27, but there is ultimately one 
thing on his mind.
  “In our sport, the end of the 
year is what we’re looking at,” Troy said.   RJ SCHAFFER

  When Florida played its 
annual match against Florida 
State last season, the Gators suf-
fered one of only three sweeps 
of the season. The other two came against reigning national champion Texas.
  UF had been swept only once 
since 2010 — an NCAA Region-als to Purdue — and twice in the regular season since 2008. But the Seminoles took care of 
business in straight sets.
  “Last year we went to Talla-
hassee and Florida State, with 
their experience, they really, re-
ally played well,” coach Mary 
Wise said. 
“They were ﬂ  awless in so 
many parts of the game and de-served the win.” 
  Tonight’s matchup at 6 will 
not only be an opportunity for No. 4 Florida (8-1) to avenge its loss to No. 17 Florida State 
(6-3), but an opportunity to see 
what kind of progress the pro-gram has made since last year’s match. 
  Florida State will be carry-
ing momentum from its ﬁ  ve-set comeback win against No. 7 Michigan on Saturday. 
  “They did have to graduate 
a couple players that gave us trouble in the past, but it’s still Florida State running a similar offense, similar defense,” Wise said. 
  “Great talent. I could see 
them winning their league again, being in the NCAA tour-nament and making a long run 
— great opportunity tomorrow 
night.”  The most difﬁ  cult challenge 
for Florida will be trying to avoid Florida State’s blocking.  The Seminoles are tied for 34th in the nation with 2.7 blocks 
per game. 
  FSU’s height advantage 
could give it a chance to slow down UF’s quick-hitting of-
fense.
  The Seminoles front line in-
cludes 6-foot-1 outside hitter Olivera Medic, 6-foot-5 right-
side hitter Elise Walch, 6-foot-2 
outside hitter Nicole Walch and 6-foot-3 middle blocker Ashley Neff. 
  “[The Walch sisters] are go-
ing to pose a threat to everyone they play,” Wise said. 
“The other day, they had 44 
kills amongst the two of them. 
They’ve got great arms. So, 
good DNA in terms of just how fast and hard they hit the ball.” 
  Middle blockers Simone 
Antwi, Chloe Mann and  out-side hitter Gabby Mallette — each standing at 6-foot-2 — are UF’s tallest players. 
  Freshman right-side hitter 
Alex Holston, who set a career high against Iona with 13 kills, a .667 hitting percentage and 13.5 points scored Saturday, 
could also play a critical role in 
the match. 
  Wise expects Holston to per-form well in her ﬁ  rst taste of 
the Gators-Seminoles rivalry.  
  “The great thing about the 
freshmen is they don’t know 
what they don’t know yet,” 
Wise said.  
“In Alex’s case, it’s just a match in the O’Connell Center. 
  “Watching how steady she 
was this whole year leads me 
to think the difference for her is going to be the great out-
side hitters that she’s playing 
against.”
