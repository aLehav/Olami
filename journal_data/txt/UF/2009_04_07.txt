A gray swastika was spray-
painted on the side of the house 
being built by traditionally Jew-ish fraternity Alpha Epsilon Pi, according to the University Police Department.
The symbol was discovered on 
Thursday night by a member of 
AEPi Fraternity, who was visiting 
the partially completed house at 14 Fraternity Row. It was reported to 
UPD on Sunday after a meeting of the fraternity’s executive board.
The incident follows another 
occurrence in early March where 
someone broke in through the fra-
ternity’s front door and defecated 
on the floor inside, said UPD Capt. Jeff Holcomb. 
Fraternity members also no-ticed a broken window in the back of the house around the same time, though they chose not to file a re-port with UPD, Holcomb said.
He said it’s still not clear when 
the swastika was spray-painted on the house and said UPD had no 
suspects or leads as of Monday af-ternoon.
 “If you’ve just got spray-paint-
ing on a building with no witness-
es and no determining evidence, 
it’s kind of hard to follow up on,” 
he said.On c AMpUS

The demand for domestic abuse shelters in 
Florida is up by about 40 percent since the reces-
sion started, according to a recent state report. 
Cpl. Bruce Ferris, a Gainesville Police detec-
tive specializing in domestic violence, said that 
economic hard times result in more domestic 
violence because people are under financial pres-sure. 
Ferris said that while domestic violence re-
ports are more common among people of a lower socioeconomic status, the problem applies to all economic classes.
“There’s domestic violence happening all over 
the city, but people with some resources don’t al-
ways report to us,” he said. “If your husband is 
well-known in the community, he’s a big guy at the church, he’s got a job in jeopardy, a lot’s not being reported because you don’t want to ruin his career.”
Marala Scott, who co-authored a book with 
her husband called “In Our House” about her childhood experience with abuse, said potential abusers are like time bombs, and economic crisis can detonate them at any moment.

Student senators plan to 
discuss a resolution supporting 
the Development, Relief and 
Education for Alien Minors, or DREAM, Act at tonight’s Sen-ate meeting.
The bill, which will be voted 
on in October by the U.S. Con-gress, would, if passed, give some undocumented students, who are between 12 and 30 years old, the opportunity to attend a  U.S. university.
“This is about equal educa-
tion, something that should not be denied,” said Unite Party Sen. Gaby Alvarez, who rep-resents UF’s sophomore class and is one of the resolution’s 
authors.
A resolution is a piece of 
legislation that states the opin-
ion of Senate but does not take 
action.
Alvarez 
wrote the resolution 
with Grey Caceros, president 
of UF’s Coalition of Spanish 
Speakers through Advocacy and Service.
The bill, which was first 
brought before the U.S. Con-gress in 2004, requires students to have lived in the U.S. before turning 16 years old and have  earned a high school diploma 
or its equivalent, such as a Gen-
eral Education Degree, or GED, according to Alvarez.
Alvarez said passing the 
DREAM Act would benefit the U.S. because it would increase the country’s educated work force.
Alvarez said she is optimis-
tic the resolution will be passed during tonight’s meeting.
Senate President Audrey 
Goldman, who represents stu-dents living in District A, said she believes this resolution will be a controversial topic since immigration is a sensitive is-sue.
“I hope the senators will 
vote according to what con-stituents want, and not to what 
their personal beliefs are,” she 
said.SG to discuss education act

GPD: No foul play suspected after 
man found dead in canal Sunday
Preliminary autopsy results from a 
man found dead in Gainesville indicat-ed that there was no foul play.
The body of Timothy McMillian, 
55, was found Sunday at about 1 p.m. after someone spotted his body behind JP Gator’s pool hall, said Gainesville Police Department spokesman Keith Kameg.
Kameg said McMillian’s autopsy showed that his death was due to natu-ral causes or the result of a fall.
“We are still waiting for toxicology 
tests to come back,” he said. “But that could take weeks to months.”
Kameg said that McMillan was at 
the Veteran’s Affairs Hospital the day he was found near a creek behind the shopping center on the corner of South-west 13th Street and Southwest 16th Avenue.

ing his girlfriend, fellow music star 
Rihanna.
The 19-year-old R&B singer 
entered his plea, speaking in a soft voice, while standing alongside his 
lawyer, Mark Gergos. His mother 
sat in the first row, red-eyed.
Within moments of the hearing, 
a lawyer for Rihanna said the sing-er was hoping a plea deal could be reached before the case goes to trial. “She would be pleased if this was over quickly,” attorney Don-ald Etra said. He reiterated that 
Rihanna would testify if required.
Brown was charged in March 
by Los Angeles County prosecu-
tors with felony assault likely to cause great bodily injury and mak-ing criminal threats. He was ar-rested nearly a month earlier after police said he was involved in an early morning altercation with a 
woman who identified the “Run 
It!” singer as her attacker.
Court records list Brown’s vic-
tim as “Robyn F.” Rihanna’s real name is Robyn Rihanna Fenty.
Etra represented the 21-year-old 
“Umbrella” singer at Monday’s ar-raignment, but did not speak dur-ing the five-minute hearing. He 
said afterward that that the singer 
is in “fine spirits” and spending time with her family in Barbados.

A new survey will allow 
Gainesville bus riders to make sug-
gestions to the Regional Transit Sys-
tem. 
Starting today, RTS will ask rid-
ers to complete a survey designed to 
find out what customers would like to see changed.The 25,000 surveys will be distrib-
uted by 25 monitors, who will ride selected routes. The survey comes as part of RTS’s 10-year Transit De-velopment Plan, which aims to keep the system adaptable and useful.
“We’re trying to get an overall 
picture of what customers want,” said Linda Kubitz, RTS marketing and communications specialist.
She said the survey will cover everything from what routes need 
benches and shelters to the useful-
ness of the RTS Web site.
A similar survey was conducted 
about four years ago, but was not as in-depth, Kubitz said.
Leah Chapman, a 
19-year-old UF sophomore who has been riding RTS buses for two years, 
said she was glad they were doing a survey.
“There are some problems with 
late drivers at the Park-N-Ride 
stops. But other than that it’s great,” she said.
The survey will also help deter-
mine where the new buses, which cost about $360,000 each, would be most useful. Kubitz said the new buses will be cheaper than keeping 
older buses running.“We’re spending money to save 
money,” she said. “Replacing buses 
is our No. 1 priority.”
The Gainesville RTS fleet has 50 
buses eligible for retirement, which means they are more than 12 years old and have more than 500,000 miles.
The survey is scheduled to run 
Tuesday through Thursday of this 
week and next week.

Gainesville police officer Daniel Surrency, 
who arrested a UF baseball player for a DUI, is 
under internal investigation.
After Surrency arrested Stephen Locke, 22, 
Surrency wrote in the arrest report that Locke was driving 10 mph under the speed limit and swerved toward incoming traffic. Surrency also wrote that Locke’s eyes were bloodshot and his speech was slurred.
The State Attorney’s Office dropped the 
case on March 7 after reviewing reports and watching the video of the traffic stop that was 
taken from Surrency’s police car. 
State Attorney Bill Cervone said although 
he thought there may have been probable 
cause for the arrest, probable cause does not equate to proof beyond a reasonable doubt. 
“First, Locke lawfully refused to take a field sobriety and a Breathalyzer test,” Cervone said. “And the video recording does not show any erratic driving patterns because it was not 
turned on until right before 
Locke was pulled over.”
There was no behavior 
such as falling or stumbling 
when he got out of the car, Cervone said.
In the video, Surrency said that he was call-ing Ofc. Joey Devore to make the DUI arrest, 
so GPD would be eligible for a renewal of a federal grant. Sgt. Joe Raulerson said there is no DUI grant. He said Devore was called to handle the arrest so the other officers could re-
sume routine patrol. Each DUI arrest can take 
up to three hours, he said. 
Raulerson said that while watching the 
video he spotted about five signs that Locke was driving drunk, including failure to make eye contact and swaying back and forth. Officer who arrested UF pitcher under investigation

Nobel Memorial Prize win-
ner and MIT institute professor 
emeritus Robert Solow spoke on 
the Obama administration’s re-sponse to the financial crisis to a crowd of about 200 students and faculty at the Reitz Union Audi-
torium on Monday.
Solow, 84, who labeled him-
self a lifelong Democrat, said 
Obama entered office faced with economic problems he did not 
create, including a deep reces-
sion, the collapse of the nation’s financial system and a low level of consumer demand. 
“I doubt that any president 
given this hand to play could have played it systematically bet-ter, and a lot of presidents would have played it worse,” he said.
Solow, who won the Nobel 
Memorial Prize for his work on economic growth in 1987,  said he favored the president’s policy of reducing budget deficits over time rather than immediately.
Still, Solow did not hesitate to criticize the  new president’s eco-
nomic policies.
“I think that the stimulus 
package was too small and too 
late,” he said.
He said he supports giving 
more money and said Obama may have to offer a second dose of stimulus at the end of the year.
Solow also found fault in the 
composition of the bill, adding more jobs would have been cre-ated if the $3 billion allocated to 
the National Science Foundation 
had been used to subsidize state and local governments.
Solow noted the stimulus 
package was an improvement 
from past responses to American 
recessions, but spoke of mixed responses by U.S. citizens to the economic downturn.
American household incomes 
declined from mid-2007 to the end of 2008, Solow said.
Despite the American econo-
my remaining just as capable of 
producing goods and services,  
many American families per-ceived themselves as poor, he said. 
At the end of his hour-long 
speech, Solow stepped off the stage, only to be swarmed by admiring students asking about career advice, autographs and 
economic affairs. 
Maria Barlett, a UF graduate 
student in international develop-ment and policy administration, complimented Solow on his easy-
to-understand economic terms. Before the speech, she said, she lacked enough knowledge to for-mulate in-depth questions about 
the U.S. financial situation. 
Before closing his speech, 
Solow alluded to the problems faced by companies once consid-
ered too big to fail, such as Gen-eral Motors and large banks.
“I would like President Obama 
to consider that too big to fail is too big to exist,” Solow said.
If a company damages the 
economy, it should be broken up, 
he said, adding the government 
should function as a regulating force.
In a question-and-answer ses-
sion, one audience member asked Solow about how long the econ-
omy would take to recover from 
the crisis.
Solow said the recession could 
hit bottom in the next 12 months, but the time of an eventual recov-
ery is unknowable to any degree.
It will take longer than a year 
for the economy to get back to anything Americans would de-
scribe as normal, he said.4, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, APRIL 7, 2009

NEW YORK — The life pris-
on sentence given to a militant 
abortion opponent was appro-
priate despite his claims that he 
only meant to injure rather than 
kill a doctor, a federal appeals 
court said Monday.
The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court 
of Appeals in Manhattan found 
no merit to challenges raised 
by James Kopp, including an 
argument that his sniper-style 
slaying in 1998 of Dr. Barnett 
Slepian in the kitchen of his 
suburban Buffalo home was not 
intentional. A three-judge panel 
said it was irrelevant whether Kopp intended to kill Slepian.
Kopp, 53, was sentenced in 
June 2007 to life in prison plus 
10 years. He was convicted in 
January 2007 of violating the Freedom of Access to Clinic En-
trances Act by killing an abor-
tion provider and of using a 
scope-equipped military assault rifle in a violent crime.
The appeals court said Kopp 
was convicted under a law that 
only requires that he acted with 
intent to injure Slepian because 
he had provided reproductive 
health services. The statute al-
lows for a life 
prison sen-
tence if death 
results.
The law 
does not re-quire that 
Kopp intend-
ed to kill the 
doctor, only 
that Kopp acted with malice and demonstrated a heightened 
disregard for human life when 
he shot him, the court said.
“The truth is not that I regret 
shooting Dr. Slepian, I regret that he died,” Kopp told report-
ers after the shooting. “I aimed 
at his shoulder, the bullet took a 
crazy ricochet, and that’s what killed him.”TUESDAY, APRIL 7, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 5
■ THOUSANDS OF VA
PATIENTS TREATED WITH UNSTERILIZED EQUIPMENT.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. — 
A Veterans Affairs patient who was among thousands treated with unsterilized equipment has 
tested positive for HIV, the first 
such case reported since the de-
partment warned veterans they could have been exposed to in-fectious diseases.
The VA previously reported 
that hepatitis had been found in 
16 patients, but the agency cau-
tioned there was no way to prove that the patients contracted the 
illnesses because of treatment at 
their facilities. In an e-mail late 
Friday, the agency said it was 
investigating “the possibility of such a relationship.”
The VA earlier this year 
warned more than 10,000 vet-
erans to get blood tests because 
they could have been exposed to contamination while getting 
colonoscopies in Murfreesboro, 
Tenn., and Miami.
The endoscopic equipment in 
question was also used at an ear, nose and throat facility in Au-gusta, Ga. All three sites failed to properly sterilize the equipment between treatments.
The VA has said it does not 
yet know if veterans who were treated with the same kind of equipment at its other 150 hos-pitals may have been exposed to the same mistake before the de-partment had a nationwide safe-ty training campaign. An agency 
spokeswoman has said the VA is cer-tain the mistake with the equip-
ment was corrected nationwide by March 14.
The problems dated back 
for more than five years at the Murfreesboro and Miami hospi-tals.
So far, less than a third — 
3,174 — have been notified of their test results. The agency also is trying to locate patients whose warning letters were returned.
The statement Friday did not 
say where the patient who tested positive for HIV was treated, and the agency did not return tele-phone and e-mail messages Mon-day. In all, at least five veterans have tested positive for hepatitis B and 11 for hepatitis C, which is potentially life-threatening.
No infections have been re-
ported from Miami.
All three sites used endoscop-
ic equipment made by Olympus American Inc., which said in a statement it is helping the VA address problems with “inadver-tently neglecting to appropriate-ly reprocess a specific auxiliary water tube.”
The problem put patients at 
risk of being exposed to other pa-tients’ body fluids.
Megan Longenderfer, an 
Olympus spokeswoman, said the company sent notices to 5,800 “customer accounts,” but a facil-ity could have more than one en-doscope.
A lawyer with more than a 
dozen clients who had colonos-copies at the VA hospital in Murfreesboro said some have tested positive for hepatitis but none for HIV.
Attorney Mike Sheppard said 
in an e-mail Monday that one cli-ent had espoghageal cancer and died from “massive infection” soon after getting a colonoscopy. He said medical records are be-ing reviewed for any connection between the infection and expo-sure.

Today’s question: Will you roll 
fewer blunts after the tobacco tax takes effect?Monday’s question: Do you own an iPhone?

Acts of intolerance have 
no place in Gainesville
Potheads targeted by new tobacco taxMean Beans
Judging by how our national press covered the G-20 
summit, President Barack “Blue Steel” Obama was off in Europe refereeing his wife’s Zoolander-esque 
“walk-off” against French First Lady Carla Bruni-Sarkozy. 
Largely invisible in the news was the fact that April 1 
marked the implementation of the biggest federal tax in-crease ever levied on tobacco, a law that may be reaching out for more green than anyone has noticed. 
Aside from being a passive-aggressive gambit, such a 
huge tax on tobacco falls much more severely on the poor. Since the tobacco taxes are scheduled to fund health in-surance for poor children and families, one may see this as a defensible piece of legislation. 
However, this only further snares our tangled health 
care situation by winding more governmental regulation around an already twisted private insurance landscape. You don’t untie a knot by simply pulling on either end of the rope; just because smoking is bad and health in-surance for impoverished families is good does not mean that this bill will be of any quantifiable positive impact to our broken medical racket.
Nobody in the American media really seemed to care.  Those that did run stories about the tax increase all 
dutifully spouted the official governmental line about how the tax would force people to quit smoking, which inanely simplifies a litany of social and psychological re-alities.
This 2009 tobacco tax, though, is particularly notable 
for being the first time the American government has suc-cessfully taxed marijuana smoking. 
While this law weighs down cigarette packs, pipe to-
bacco, chewing tobacco and snuff with 158-percent tax increases, the real money is being made on blunt smokers. The law taxes large cigars more than 700 percent more, while small cigars and “roll your own” wrappers were hit with tax increases over 2,000 percent.  
Gas station owners are outraged 
— the cheeky-eyed customers who buy blunt wraps and papers also end up buying a lot of overpriced 
chips and sodas. 
Experts are predicting Funyuns sales to plummet na-
tionwide.
The April 15 deadline to file federal income taxes, the 
ultimate American un-holiday, falls right before the 4/20 national marijuana smoking holiday. Since this issue ties into both unruly taxation and the roll-your-own crowd, I hereby suggest a national day of protest for blunt aficio-nados somewhere in between these two days.
Most of the taxed and blunted will be scrambling to fill 
out paperwork on the 15th, and on the 20th weedheads will be sinking into couches across the country and will be too busy watching DVDs to take part in an organized protest.
Saturday, April 18 seems like a fair compromise. I know that organizing smokers to do anything other 
than listen to music or play video games is a Herculean task, but I even have a nifty motto everyone can chant — “No taxation without legalization.”
Just remember — bring your own damn Funyuns.Tommy Maple is an international communications gradu-
ate student. His column appears on Tuesdays.News of inflammatory graffiti on the side of a UF frater-
nity house has the Editorial Board dismayed by such thoughtless actions that only serve to oppress and 
spread ill will.
By drawing a swastika on AEPi’s soon-to-open chapter 
house, the spineless individual responsible for the anti-Semitic action demonstrated behavior that embodies an archaic ideol-ogy utterly unacceptable in American society.
Whether the decision to spray a symbol of enmity stems from 
a disagreement between two fraternities or simply someone with a warped perception of the world, there is no situation in which one could justify this clear-cut example of malevolence. 
Committing a hate crime puts a damper on the entire com-
munity, not just the group directly affected by such malicious behavior.
Gainesville and UF students alike pride themselves as a city 
and people that opens its arms to anyone and everyone — no better shown than by the recent city election.
The Editorial Board can’t help but wonder why someone 
would risk fines and jail time just so that they could attempt to belittle a Jewish fraternity in the crudest fashion possible.
Yes, the swastika hurts and acts as a reminder of a trying his-
tory as a people, but we are confident that the men of AEPi will come together and emerge stronger as a result.
Actions such as these contradict what The Gator Nation 
stands for, and we urge law enforcement to make that known by charging any potential subject to the fullest extent of the law.
UF and Gainesville will not allow for acts of hate to go un-
noticed in our own backyard.
With final exams and projects looming on the horizon, the 
Editorial Board would like to take the opportunity to encourage you to consume massive amounts of coffee and don’t stop.
Wait, what?According to an article 
on CNN.com, caffeine with-drawal has caused major problems for coffee drink-ers across the country to the point that they’ve experi-enced flu-like symptoms, such as headaches and even depression.
If a Starbucks addict fails 
to down a cup of joe as little as 12 hours after his or her latest fix, then he or she may start feeling lousy and unable to function.
The worst results ensue 
for coffee addicts trying to kick their habit cold turkey — a big no-no according to health experts.
Instead of going from five 
cups to zero overnight, the best course of action would be adopting a “step-down” pro-gram that gradually weens the drinker off the good stuff (no, not Crown Royal).
As the end of the semester 
means long nights at Club West, we recommend if you plan on drinking coffee or any other caffeine-based drink to make sure to stay consistent.
If you know your sched-
ule will include an off-day or two from studying, we en-courage you to treat yourself to an iced coffee at Starbucks (unsweetened, Venti and room for milk) even when you aren’t planning a mara-thon love session with your biology textbook.
Nothing sucks more than 
coming down with a panic attack on your one free day when you could be reac-quainting yourself with the joys of “Half Baked” ice cream and a “Twilight” DVD.
Trust us and you’ll thank 
us later.

Letters to the Editor
Cut expenses, not faculty
In my opinion, the impending 
budget cuts show what each de-
partment and the university val-ues. Here is a recent example of misplaced values.
An outstanding College of Jour-
nalism and Communications pro-fessor, Dr. Judy Robinson, is one of many whose job security is in jeop-ardy. She models effective teach-ing strategies, responds to student needs, incorporates cutting-edge technologies, inspires innovative thinking and designs meaningful assignments. Her class has been one of the best courses of my grad-uate career. 
During the semester, the class’s 
lab has received an overhead pro-
jector ($2,000 - $4,000) and an Elmo 
projector ($800-$3000) to replace ones in perfect condition. With financial restraints, we should re-
duce operating expenses and keep 
outstanding faculty. If we use 
projectors until they need to be re-placed, perhaps we could make it through the recession without cut-
ting faculty. The teachers are the 
ones who are going to educate us, 
not the equipment. Stop spending money on equipment and keep the people who are contributing to the 
university’s success.

Homeless need better food
In response to an article re-
garding the ongoing debate about 
policy concerning the act of feed-ing the homeless, I feel obliged to speak about a recent experience that may provide some insight for others on this situation. 
About two weeks ago, the Uni-
versity of Florida’s Leadership De-velopment Institute co-sponsored an event called “GOT FOOD?” with Actions, which included a daylong fast and a scavenger hunt. Amongst the tasks were feeding and then interviewing a homeless person. Upon interviewing several of the homeless, I was surprised to hear that many homeless steer clear of the meals served by the St. Francis House. 
With the mention of the St. 
Francis House establishment, most of the interviewees retorted with 
repudiation and disgust. Why? 
Many, if not all, of the homeless in-terviewees reported that they often fall sick after eating a meal from the St. Francis House. 
This is an inevitable problem 
when it comes to housing and nourishment. Such problems as those expressed by the homeless interviewees may contribute to the onslaught of serious health issues that would only lead to a greater problem within the Gainesville community. 
While there is the obvious 
problem of what policy should be passed in order to regulate the number of meals that should be served at places such as the St. Francis House and the Salvation Army, perhaps the true ques-tion is how much longer will the 
Gainesville homeless be subject to 
the low-quality food served at the local shelters.

Curving is grade redistribution
Johnathan Lott ought to get his 
facts straight before trying to be 
cute. UF does have a grade redis-
tribution system. It is called curv-
ing grades, which literally means you force grades in to a normal distribution; they are fit to the bell 
curve. Many of the university’s 
most commended students would fail out if they were graded merely on their raw percentage scores rather than on a curve.

Before watching the video “Harvest of 
Fear,” I had never heard of genetically modified organisms. 
Most people do not know they have 
consumed genetically modified crops be-
cause there is no law saying that they must be labeled as such.
Genetically modified crops, also known 
as genetically modified organisms or GMOs, are crops that have been injected with a specific plant or animal gene that enhances the crop’s ability to fight a par-ticular virus, infection or disease, making 
it immune so the crop can flourish.
The simplest way to do this is to use a 
gene gun. Scientists literally shoot genes 
into the crop with compressed air.  
GMOs are used in agriculture to create 
healthier and more abundant crops. For example, in Hawaii papayas were 
being destroyed by a virus. Once geneti-cally modified, the papaya were not only 
immune to the virus, but they grew larger.
Scientists can also modify the genes of 
crops so they do not need pesticides be-
cause the crop can produce its own defens-
es against pests. 
This helps farmers save an abundant 
amount of money because all they have 
to do is plant the GMO without having to worry about spraying it with chemicals. 
One argument for the use of GMOs is 
that they produce a lot more food, which could curb world hunger. This problem will not go away without help from sci-
ence. With GMOs, there will be more food, 
which will help everyone out. 
GMOs have not been found to be harm-ful to humans. It has taken three de-cades of research 
and not one prob-
lem has arisen due 
to GMOs. 
An argument against them is that we do 
not know the long-term effects of these or-
ganisms. 
Only time will tell what will happen, 
if anything, because of the GMOs we con-sume. 
The second argument against the use of 
GMOs is a moral one. Is it right to be shoot-ing genes from an animal into a plant, or vice versa? 
Also, GMOs are not labeled for the con-
sumer. 
I am in favor of GMOs. A major problem in the world today is 
starvation. With GMOs, more food will be produced, but the hardest part will still be 
distributing it. 
A second reason I am for GMOs is that 
not only will we have more food, but it will 
be stronger. The crops produced will be 
immune to disease, infection and viruses. 
With proper research, the food will be 
healthier than ever. 
This is a giant step; who knows where 
it will take us to finding cures or exploring any other possibilities? 
I know that the future may be unknown 
and frightening, but isn’t that how science 
works — strategically groping around the 
unknown hoping to find answers?

Speaking OutTHE ASSOCIATED PRESS
ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — De-
claring the U.S. “is not and never 
will be at war with Islam,” President Barack Obama worked Monday to mend frayed ties with NATO ally 
Turkey and improve relations with 
the larger Muslim world.
Obama acknowledged still-raw 
tensions over the Iraq war but said Muslims worldwide have little in common with terrorists such as al-Qaida and have much to gain in op-posing them. Reaching out, he also spoke of Muslim connections in his 
own background.
“We seek broader engagement 
based upon mutual interest and 
mutual respect,” Obama said in a speech to Turkey’s Parliament.
It was his first visit to a predomi-
nantly Islamic nation as president, and he struck a balance between ex-tending a hand to Muslims in gen-
eral and discussing Turkey’s central 
role in helping to bring stability to a post-war Iraq and the wider Middle East.
“Our partnership with the Mus-
lim world is critical, not just in roll-ing back the violent ideologies that people of all faiths reject but also to strengthen opportunity for all its 
people,” he said. He portrayed ter-
rorist groups such as al-Qaida as ex-tremists far removed from the vast majority of Muslims.
Turkey has NATO’s largest 
Army after the U.S., but relations be-tween the two countries soured after the 2003 invasion of Iraq, which the Turks opposed. Turkey barred U.S. forces from going through its coun-try to attack Iraq.
Now, however, since Obama is 
withdrawing troops, Turkey has be-come more cooperative.
Sharing parts of its southern bor-
der with Iraq, Turkey’s role in main-taining security will be pivotal after U.S. combat troops are gone, despite the Turks’ lingering problems with Kurdish militants in northern Iraq. Turkey also has important leverage 
with both Afghanistan and Pakistan 
and has served as a broker between Israel and several Arab states.
“Turkey’s greatness lies in your ability to be at the center of things. This is not where East and West di-vide — this is where they come to-gether,” Obama said.
He acknowledged hard feel-
ings over Iraq. “I know that strain is shared in many places where the Muslim faith is practiced. So let me say this as clearly as I can: The Unit-ed States is not and will never be at war with Islam.”
Obama’s visit was closely 
watched by an Islamic world that harbored deep distrust of his prede-
cessor, George W. Bush. 
Al-Jazeera and Al-Arabiya, two 
of the biggest Arabic satellite chan-
nels, carried his remarks live.
The president invoked his own 
heritage: “The United States has been enriched by Muslim Ameri-cans. Many other Americans have Muslims in their family, or have 
lived in a Muslim-majority country. 
I know, because I am one of them.”
Obama’s Kenyan father and 
grandfather were Muslims, and he spent time as a child in Indonesia, the country with the world’s largest Muslim population.
The president spoke for about 
25 minutes from a small white-mar-
ble-and-teak rostrum in the well of 
a vast, airy chamber packed with Turkish lawmakers in orange leath-er chairs.
Except for a few instances of po-
lite applause, the room was quiet during his speech. There was a more hearty ovation toward the end when Obama said the U.S. supports 
the Turkish government’s battle 
against the Kurdish rebel group PKK, which both nations consider a terrorist group, and again when he said America was not at war with Islam. Lawmakers also applauded when Obama said the United States supports Turkey’s bid to join the Eu-ropean Union.

The sounds of hammers, drills and country radio filled 
Weimer Hall’s basement Monday afternoon as workers re-
model for a million-dollar multimedia lab.
The lab is funded by $1.5 million in project money allo-
cated over two years by UF to Dr. John Wright II, the College of Journalism and Communications’ dean, when he took his post.
Scheduled to open in August, the lab will be used by jour-
nalism and telecommunications students.
New courses, which are expected to be created specifically 
for the lab, will bring together students from the two majors, 
according to David Carlson, director of the Center for Media Innovation and Research and 
manager of the project.
“It’s gonna be cool, I wish we could have 
done it 10 years ago,” he said.
The lab will contain a 3-D projector, a “whisper room” 
for recording audio without interference and a wall of about 
eight 56-inch flat-screen monitors which can be controlled to display a single image or dozens of videos, among other con-figurations.
Carlson believes that while the upgrade is expensive, 
learning to combine old and new media is necessary to pre-pare students for the evolving field of communication and for UF to remain a top journalism college, he said.
“People are catching up and it’s time for us to take another 
leap forward,” he said.
Carl Byngton, a Ward Construction employee, isn’t sure 
that construction will be finished by the deadline.
“Things don’t happen too fast around here,” he said of 
projects undertaken on UF’s campus.
The additional $500,000 of the dean’s project money is ex-
pected to go toward a similar collaboration center for adver-tising and public relations majors, Carlson said.UF constructs

Two men hug each other as people and volunteers stand amid debris in the city of 
L’Aquila, after a strong earthquake rocked central Italy early Monday. The earthquake killed at least 16 people, as well as collapsing buildings and leaving thousands of people homeless, officials and news reports said. Officials said the death toll was likely to rise as rescue crews made their way through the debris.

Despite the economic downturn, 
the number of students grabbing 
passports to head to Paris with UF’s 
College of Journalism and Communi-
cations has remained steady.
Melissa Johns, 21, stood in the fi-
nancial aid line at Criser Hall at least two times this semester. 
She said she needed funds to study 
abroad for her senior summer trip with the journalism department.
“It’s expensive, but it is also a once-
in-a-lifetime opportunity,” she said. “I have been putting it off for the past three years, and I know if I don’t do it now, I never will.”
Although the program is one 
month long, Johns plans to stay for an additional month. She estimated she will need about $7,500 for airfare and living expenses during that time. 
Johanna Cleary, an assistant pro-
fessor in UF’s telecommunications department, has been involved in the College of Journalism and Communi-cations study abroad trips for the past two years. She said the department was concerned  enrollment for the program might be down because of the economy, but added the number 
of participants will match the amount 
in last year’s group.
“It took us a little longer to get 
there,” Cleary said, “but in light of how serious the economy is, we feel pretty good about how the program has turned out.”
She said she was surprised that the program’s additional side trip to Lon-don is full, even  though it cost about $500, in addition to the basic program cost of $5,690. 
Cleary said two more faculty 
members were scheduled to be added to the program given the popularity of the trip last summer.
She said the program hoped it 
would bring more students than last year, but the economy’s decline has kept the numbers equal.
“We will be able to offer every-
thing we wanted, however,” she said, “I think we have come off pretty well 
of things considered.”
Cleary said because 
the France study abroad trip occurs during the summer, the Florida 
Bright Futures Scholarship Program will not cover its fees. However, she said there are other funding opportu-nities, such as Florida Prepaid College Plan and outside student loans.
Mike Weigold, an advertising 
professor, is in charge of the applica-tion process for the program and said available scholarships are offered 
through UF’s International Center.
“The downside here is you will 
need to commit to the program before 
you know if you get a scholarship,” Weigold wrote in an e-mail.
For remaining costs, loans may be 
obtained through institutions that offer financial aid, he said.
Johns said she didn’t qualify for 
additional aid through UF and all 
of her current aid has been used  for fall and spring semester classes.Study abroad steady

Jimmy Bailey loves to cook. In fact, he cooks four 
times a day.
He cooks breakfast, lunch and dinner for the in-
mates of the Alachua County Jail, and lunch once a day 
for the staff.
Bailey, 46, who was arrested in September for theft, 
is one of four inmates who are attending the 90-day culinary program offered at the jail. Through the pro-gram, the inmates learn about kitchen safety, sanita-tion, cooking utensils and food storage. 
“Inmates cooking to earn a certification to possibly 
get a job when they get out of jail, that’s something 
new,” ASO Bureau Chief Eugene Morris said.
The food service company ARAMARK provides the 
class with its food, supplies and teachers.
Ninety-five percent of the inmates are going home 
after they serve their time in jail and most of them live 
in Gainesville, he said.
“From the time someone walks in the door to the 
time they go home, it is our job to get them ready for reentry,” Morris said. “And it is their job to take advan-
tage of what we provide.”
Morris said the jail held a construction program last 
fall for the inmates, and a few of them who have been 
released are now taking construction courses at Santa Fe College.
If the inmates pass the course’s final test, they will 
be certified food service professionals, Morris said. He smiled as he said that his speech at the course gradua-tion will probably include “a recipe for success.”Jail offers

�� MOST CASES DEAL WITH 
FRAUDULENT CHECKS.
 By AMANDA HINES 
 Alligator Contributing Writer 
   
 As more people join Facebook 
and Myspace, the social net-
working Web sites have become 
a breeding ground for money scams.
Caitlin Murphy, a 20-year-old 
sophomore at Santa Fe College, 
received a check for $2,300 for two tickets she sold for $200 on Face-
book’s Marketplace application.
“I felt weird about the whole 
transaction,” Murphy said, “but I followed the directions the seller 
gave me because I could have used the money.” 
She said the buyer contacted 
her through e-mail and told her to consider the tickets sold for $200 
even though she listed the tickets for $50.
After getting the check, Mur-
phy said the letter attached said 
to put the check into her account, 
get a money order for the sum left over and send the money order to a different address.
She said a teller at the Wacho-
via Bank on Southwest Archer Road warned her that the check may be fraudulent.
The teller consulted with co-
workers and then called a num-ber that told her the funds for the check were not there.“If I would have sent the mon-
ey order, the check would never go through and I would have been 
out $2,000,” Murphy said.
According to Tiffany Dunn, 
a veriﬁ  cation unit 
analyst for Wachovia Bank’s loss manage-
ment department in 
Northeast Florida, fraud through 
social-networking sites is becom-ing a popular way to target col-
lege students.
“Most of the time students are 
in desperate need of money and 
are easily tricked,” Dunn said.
She said most of these cases 
are usually through fraudulent checks that scammers use to buy items off places like Facebook’s Marketplace application or eBay.
“Any time you sell something 
and someone sends you a check 
for more than the item is worth, 
and then wants you to send them the rest of the money back, it is usually a scam,” Dunn said.
Murphy said she e-mailed the 
buyer and told him she lost the tickets to avoid controversy. She said he had her address and she didn’t want to take any chances.
The growing numbers of scams 
through social-networking sites has triggered response from the Better Business Bureau.
The Northeast Florida Bet-
ter Business Bureau ofﬁ  ce in Gainesville is linked to consumer tips on how to be protected against scammers on social-networking sites.
According to the news release, 
wiring money to a different loca-tion is common, and if completed there is no way for consumers to get the money back.
Even though check fraud has 
long been a problem, Dunn said the number of cases are rising be-cause social-networking Web sites allow people to claim to be friends 
with someone they don’t know.
“If the money is too good to be 
true,” she said, “it probably is.” 
Dunn said you should never 
accept checks from someone you don’t know and to try to use a 
payment system like PayPal to safeguard transactions.

 Weather analysts predict that Gainesville 
will see a record temperature drop to 33 de-
grees early Wednesday morning.
A cold front is expected to move into 
northwest Florida, followed by a cold air mass from Canada.
“The air coming behind the cold front is 
going to be even colder because of where it’s coming from,” said Phil Peterson, a fore-
caster for the National Weather Service in Jacksonville.
The previous record cold for April 8 was 
in 2007, with a morning temperature of 35 degrees, according to the National Weather Service Web site.
Gainesville has already experienced re-
cord heat, a dry spell and record rainfall this 
year, Peterson said.
“The whole year has been very strange,” he said.
Frankie Hall, the director of the agricul-
ture policy division of the Federal Farm Bu-
reau Federation, said some vegetables like watermelon, peppers and green beans might be damaged by the cold weather.
“A late frost could hurt these tender 
crops,” Hall said.
Farmers in North Florida do not have irri-
gation systems that farmers in South Florida have, which also can be used to blanket the 
crops with ice to protect them from freezing.
“At this time, we’re at Mother Nature’s 
hand,” he said. “We just hope and pray that 
it is not as bad as they predicted it to be.” Forecasters predict record temperature drop in G’villeStudentLife

BINGHAMTON, N.Y. — The man 
who opened fire in an immigrant 
center, killing 13 people before tak-
ing his own life, felt he was perse-
cuted by police, couldn’t accept his “poor life” and was intent on kill-ing himself and at least two other 
people, according to a letter mailed 
to a television station the day of the massacre.
The letter’s authenticity could not 
immediately be verified Monday. It 
was mailed to News 10 Now, in Syr-
acuse, and postmarked Friday, the day Wong went into the American Civic Association community center 
and started shooting.
Part of the letter reads: “I am 
Jiverly Wong shooting the people.”
The letter was dated March 18, 
more than two weeks before the shooting, which occurred in a neigh-
borhood of homes and small busi-nesses.
It included photos of Wong smil-
ing with two guns, a gun permit and his driver’s license.
The letter ends with him saying 
he can’t “accept my poor life,” that he is taking on the job of a judge and 
will “cut my poor life.” He writes “at 
least two people with me go to re-turn to the dust of the earth.”
Police speculated Wong, who 
was ethnically Chinese but was from Vietnam, was angry over losing a job and frustrated about his poor Eng-lish skills.
The letter reads, “I am sorry I 
know a little English.”
It indicates a delusional man ob-
sessed with unidentified police he says taunted him and tortured him, even going into his room, watching him sleep and touching him while he slept.
The letter says police stole money 
from his wallet and stopped their cars in front of him 32 times in ef-forts to make him crash into them.TUESDAY, APRIL 7, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 11

CHICAGO — A striking new study says almost 
1 in 5 American 4-year-olds is obese, and the rate 
is alarmingly higher among American Indian chil-dren, with nearly a third of them obese.
Researchers were surprised to see differences 
by race at so early an age.
Overall, more than half a million 4-year-olds 
are obese, the study suggests. Obesity is more common in Hispanic and black youngsters, too, 
but the disparity is most startling in American In-
dians, whose rate is almost double that of whites.
The lead author said that rate is worrisome 
among children so young, even in a population 
at higher risk for obesity because 
of other health problems and eco-
nomic disadvantages.
“The magnitude of these differ-
ences was larger than we expected, 
and it is surprising to see differences by racial 
groups present so early in childhood,” said Sarah 
Anderson, an Ohio State University public health 
researcher. She conducted the research with Tem-
ple University’s Dr. Robert Whitaker.
Dr. Glenn Flores, a pediatrics and public health 
professor at University of Texas Southwestern Medical School in Dallas, said the research is an 
important contribution to studies documenting ra-
cial and ethnic disparities in children’s weight.
“The cumulative evidence is alarming because 
within just a few decades, America will become a ‘minority majority’ nation,” he said. Without inter-
ventions, the next generation “will be at very high 
risk” for heart disease, high blood pressure, can-
cers, joint diseases and other problems connected 
with obesity, said Flores, who was not involved in 
the new research.
The study is an analysis of nationally represen-
tative height and weight data on 8,550 preschool-ers born in 2001. Children were measured in their 
homes and were part of a study conducted by the 
government’s National Center for Education Sta-
tistics. The results appear in Monday’s Archives of

Dance-Off
Students wait to play Dance Dance Revolution in the Reitz Union Game Room Monday night, while James 
Jacoby twists barefoot in the air. Jacoby followed along on the floor when it was the other students’ turn to play.
The damage to the house was 
estimated to be $200 or less, mak-
ing it a second-degree misdemean-or, he said. UPD would likely up-
grade the charge to make it a hate 
crime, he said, which would bump 
up the charge to a first-degree mis-demeanor, punishable by up to one year in prison and a $1,000 fine.
“We’re taking this very serious-
ly,” said Alex Mehler, a member of the fraternity.
“This was a hate crime,” Mehler 
said. “An act of anti-Semitism.”He said the fraternity is trying 
to make people in the community aware of the incident to prevent 
similar things from happening in 
the future.
“This is how hatred starts; this 
is how the genocide started,” he said, referring to the Holocaust.
Mehler said the fraternity has 
been in contact with UF officials as well as members of state govern-
ment such as Rep. Adam Hasner, 
R-Delray Beach, the House major-
ity leader who has advocated for 
Jewish issues.
“They are all outraged that… such an act happened on the UF 
campus,” he said.
Matt Friedman, who became the 
new president of AEPi on Monday, 
said the fraternity doesn’t know who is responsible and said he re-
alizes it may not even be someone from UF 
or Gainesville.
“We’re not point-
ing fingers at anyone,” he said.
“We’re just trying to make sure 
this doesn’t happen again.”
Patricia Telles-Irvin, UF’s vice 
president for student affairs, sent a 
letter to the fraternity on Monday offering her support.
“It is unfortunate such an act 
of vandalism, particularly with a 
symbol which has come to stand 
for hate and reminds us of one of the greatest tragedies of human 
history, occurred on the University 
of Florida campus,” she wrote.
The Anti-Defamation League, 
which fights anti-Semitism, big-otry and extremism, according to 
its Web site, also issued a news re-
lease from its Florida branch con-
demning the incident.
Mehler said the fraternity plans 
to move into their new house in time for fall semester. 
Luke Napoli, vice president of 
neighboring Pi Lambda Phi Fra-ternity, expressed disappointment 
after walking out of his house’s kitchen Monday around noon and 
seeing the spray-painted swastika.
“That’s not cool,” he said, add-
ing he doesn’t think his fraternity 
is responsible.
“Why would we put that up?” 
he asked. “We have to look at it.”
He didn’t rule out the possibil-
ity entirely, though. 
“I hope its not one of our new, 
stupid young guys,” he said.University administration, Anti-Defamation League express support
tions at work. He would have lost his job,” she said. “But 
when he came home, he took out those frustrations on us.”
Scott said another factor is that often the abused is fi-
nancially tethered to the abuser.
“That’s why Mom stayed. She didn’t think she had any 
alternative because she couldn’t afford to take care of six children,” she said.
Scott called abuse the silent killer, saying that victims 
of abuse — men, too, though less common than women — are often reliant on their abusers for economic and emo-tional stability and don’t stand up for themselves. 
“I am not one of those women. I would just not accept 
it,” she said. “But I got that way by seeing my mother beat-
en until she was unconscious and her teeth were knocked 
out and her eyes were black.”
Theresa Harrison, director of Peaceful Paths domestic 
abuse shelter, said in the past year the organization has seen a radical increase in the number of abuse victims looking for help, especially those who need financial as-
sistance. 
“(Abuse) tends to mirror what’s going on in the greater 
societal picture,” she said. “The reason we’re seeing on a 
statewide level such a dramatic increase is that this reces-sion has hit people harder than most of the external factors we’ve seen in the last 15 years.”
Harrison said it’s important to realize that stress is not 
an excuse.
“Ultimately, violent behavior is chosen behavior,” she 
said. “Despite the millions of people who are being im-pacted by the recession every day, the majority of them aren’t engaging in violent behavior as a tactic to deal with their stress.”Economy may play 
role in abuse increaseOnCampu sGRAFFITI , from page 1

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
MIAMI — The major league’s first in-
side-the-park homer on opening day since 
1968 left Emilio Bonifacio a bit winded.
“He came into the dugout, and he was 
gassed, and he couldn’t breathe, and he was asking people for water,” Florida teammate Cody Ross said.
Meanwhile, the crowd kept roaring, so 
Ross and Dan Uggla gave Bonifacio a push up the steps for the first curtain call of his life.
Bonifacio became a crowd favorite in 
his Marlins’ debut Monday, going 4 for 5 with a thrilling homer in a 12-6 victory against his former team, the Washington Nationals.
Florida also hit three homers over the 
fence, including Hanley Ramirez’s grand slam.
“That’s the way you start a season,” 
Ramirez said.
The offense was a bonus coming from 
Bonifacio, who joined Florida with a repu-tation as a slick-fielding but light-hitting speedster. It turned out he’s fast enough to 
beat out a homer.
His first big league homer landed short 
of the warning track but sailed over center 
fielder Lastings Milledge because he was playing so shallow.
The last inside-the-park home run on 
opening day was hit on April 10, 1968, by Boston’s Carl Yastrzemski. Bonifacio said he never heard of the Hall of Famer, but then Yaz probably never heard of the 23-year-old Bonifacio, who’s known more 
for his speed than his bat.“He’s the fastest guy I’ve ever seen in 
my life,” Ramirez said.
Bonifacio stole three bases and scored 
all four times he reached. Jorge Cantu and 
Jeremy Hermida hit Florida’s first two homers. Ramirez drove in five runs and 
Cantu three. Ricky Nolasco (1-0) pitched 
six innings to win in his first opening-day start.
The Nationals looked much like the 
2008 team that lost 102 games, the most 
in the majors. Starter John Lannan (0-1) 
departed after three innings, trailing 6-1. The bullpen fared no better and a defense that was woeful last year committed two 
errors.
One bright spot for Washington was the 
bat of newcomer Adam Dunn, who drove 
in four runs with a double and a homer.
“I was pretty confident I was going to 
hit one this year,” he said with a laugh.
Bonifacio singled, stole a base and 
scored in the first, then did it again in the third. 
But his best moment came with a run-
ner on in the fourth, when he drove Je-sus Tavarez’s 3-2 pitch to deep center. Milledge retreated and dove but failed to come up with the ball, and Bonifacio flew 
around the bases and slid home ahead of 
the throw.
“Pretty exciting,” said Bonifacio, who at 
first thought Milledge was going to make 
the catch. “When I saw him start running 
back I said, ‘Oh, he doesn’t have it,’ so I started running hard.”

■ JORDAN WON SIX TITLES 
IN HIS 15-YEAR CAREER.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
DETROIT — Air Jordan has a 
new name: Hall of Famer.
Michael Jordan was elected to 
the class of 2009 on Monday, set 
for induction in September with 
his Dream Team teammates David 
Robinson and John Stockton. Utah Jazz coach Jerry Sloan and Rutgers women’s coach C. Vivian Stringer are also part of a class announced in Detroit.
Induction is Sept. 10-12 in 
Springfield, Mass., home of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall 
of Fame.
“I don’t like being up here for 
the Hall of Fame because at that time, your basketball career is com-pletely over,” Jordan said. “I was 
hoping this day would be 20 more years, or actually go in when I’m dead and gone.”
Jordan’s Hall of Fame selection 
was a slam dunk after he retired as perhaps the greatest player in his-tory, and he gave much of the credit Monday to his college coach.
“There’s no way you guys would 
have got a chance to see Michael Jordan play without Dean Smith,” Jordan said.
His soaring dunks, Nike com-
mercials and “Air Jordan” nick-name helped stamp him as one of the most recognizable athletes 
around the world. He finished a 15-
year career with the Chicago Bulls and Washington Wizards with 32,292 points — the third-highest total in league history, behind Ka-
reem Abdul-Jabbar and Karl Ma-
lone. His final career average of 30.12 points per game goes down as the best, just ahead of Wilt Cham-berlain’s 30.07.
“Simply the 
greatest to ever play the game of basketball. He is 
the one player 
that each young person in this league should emulate and as-pire to become. 
His work ethic, drive, skill level and competitive spirit were un-
matched,” Jordan’s former Bulls 
teammate and now the team’s gen-eral manager, John Paxson, said.
Jordan was a five-time NBA MVP, won six championships with 
the Bulls and another in college 
with North Carolina. 
Tar Heels coach Roy Williams 
was an assistant with Carolina on that 1982 championship team and was at Monday’s induction, where Ty Lawson won the Bob Cousy award as the nation’s top point guard.
Jordan retired twice during his 
career. He first came back to the Bulls in 1994 and won three more championships before retiring again in 1998, then had an ill-fated two-year stint with the Washington Wizards before calling it quits for good in 2003. He’s now managing 
partner of the Charlotte Bobcats.
On Monday, he joked that when 
he saw Stockton and Robinson, 
he was ready to put his shorts on again.
“I always want to be able to have 
you thinking I can always go back and play the game of basketball and put your shorts on,” Jordan said. 
“Hall of Fame to me is like, OK, 
it’s over and done with.”
Jordan won two of his titles in 
the 1990s against Sloan, Stockton and the Jazz. 
Stockton spent his entire career 
with Utah, finished with 19,711 points and holds NBA records  for 15,806 assists and 3,265 steals. He also holds NBA records for most assists in a season (1,164 in 1990-91) and highest assist average in a sea-son (14.5 in 1989-90).
“Growing up, I never thought 
about the Hall of Fame,” Stockton said. “All I wanted was a chance to go to college.”

TALLAHASSEE — FSU football coach Bobby Bowden 
has indefinitely suspended senior wide receiver Rod Ow-
ens on Monday after the player’s weekend drunk driving 
arrest.
Police spokesman David McCranie said Owens was ar-
rested in Tallahassee on a DUI charge after blowing near-ly double the state’s legal standard of .08 on a breath test early Sunday. He was released 
from jail later that day.
The school said it would not have any 
further comment on the incident. Owens 
didn’t return a message left for him at the 
school and a home telephone listing wasn’t 
available.
Five players — all receivers — sat out at least one game last fall for their role in a campus brawl that led to the ar-
rest of two players. One of those athletes, sophomore Bert 
Reed, was suspended three times last season for different reasons.
Receiver and punt returner Preston Parker was kicked 
off the team in February after multiple arrests.
The Seminoles will be thin at wide receiver next year 
as Parker and Greg Carr, both starters in 2008, will not be with the team.FSU wide receiver Owens suspended after DUI arrestjordan

Grounds crew members run as they pull a tarp over the infield at Fenway Park in Boston on Monday. The 
opening-day game between the Boston Red Sox and the Tampa Bay Rays was postponed due to rain.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
BOSTON — The rain rolled in 
and the Tampa Bay Rays ran off 
the field five minutes after starting 
their workout.
Their first opening day as 
American League champions 
had already been postponed un-til Tuesday, originally an off day, because of a forecast of heavy rain and high winds.
First baseman Carlos Pena 
didn’t mind waiting to take his 
cuts at the home of the Boston Red 
Sox.
“We didn’t want to hit any-
way,” the Rays slugger said Mon-
day with a laugh as he returned to 
the tiny visitors’ clubhouse at Fen-
way Park. “We’ll hit tomorrow.”
They hit enough against the 
Red Sox in Game 7 of last year’s 
AL Championship Series to win 
3-1 and advance to the World Se-
ries, where they lost to the Phila-
delphia Phillies.
There have been some interest-
ing personnel changes since then.
Rocco Baldelli, whose RBI single 
broke a 1-all tie in the ALCS finale, is now with Boston. Pat Burrell, whose double began the winning rally for the Phillies in the decisive 
fifth game of the World Series, is 
with Tampa Bay.
Some things remained the same 
— Boston’s Josh Beckett and Tam-pa Bay’s James Shields, Monday’s scheduled starters, will meet in a rematch of Game 6 of the ALCS, a 
4-2 Red Sox win.
And the Rays, despite their 
climb from last place in 2007 to the 
World Series, still are opening the season on the road, subject to the 
uncertainties of the early spring 
weather in New England, rather 
than in the warmth of their dome at home.
“It’s not really a surprise to 
me,” said Shields, who has never 
played a season opener at home 
in his three full seasons with the Rays. “We’ve got to win more to get that honor.”
Not necessarily.
“You would think” the AL 
champs would open at home, Rays 
outfielder Carl Crawford said, “but I think they make these schedules 
a while before.”
The last postponed Red Sox 
home opener was in 2003, also be-
cause of rain.
There was plenty of warning Monday as long-range forecasts 
called for rain to start during the 
afternoon and continue through the day. It stopped briefly after the Rays left the field, then began rain-
ing heavily 15 minutes after the 
scheduled 2:05 p.m. starting time.
Tampa Bay manager Joe Mad-don agreed with the decision to 
call the game early but said, “I 
know the weather’s good at Tropi-cana Field.”

UF pitcher Patrick Keating practices pitching during the Gators’ 6-3 win against Louisville on Feb. 20 in McKethan 
Stadium. Keating has been inconsistent this season and may find himself without a starting job soon.
didn’t practice, as he’s nursing a hamstring injury.
Starting linebackers Dustin Doe and A.J. Jones were 
held out as well, but Meyer was buoyed by the return of 
redshirt freshman linebacker Brendan Beal (knee) and de-fensive end Carlos Dunlap (abdominal strain).
The offensive line is especially depleted. Mike and 
Maurkice Pouncey, Carl Johnson, Matt Patchan and James Wilson have all struggled with injuries, and Wilson rein-jured his left foot Saturday.“James is getting an MRI tonight,” Meyer said. “He’s 
had some feet problems, and I don’t know (his status). He was doing very well before he got hurt, and the good news is that even if it’s something serious, he’ll be fine in 
the fall.”
The only positive has been that new arrivals Nick Ala-
jajian and Jonotthan Harrison are getting plenty of reps 
in practice as a result. The experience should help with UF’s lack of depth on the line, offensive coordinator Steve Addazio said.MEYER WON’T COMMENT ON HARVIN’S DRUG TEST: Last 
week, a report on NFLDraftBible.com claimed that former UF wideout Percy Harvin, along with two other players, tested positive for marijuana at the NFL Scouting Com-bine. 
The report cited several sources, as well as an NFL 
team, and Meyer refused to comment on the situation Monday.
“I’m not going to comment on that other than that I 
love Percy, and he has done a lot for our program,” he said. “I would just be shocked.”
When asked if Harvin had ever failed a drug test while 
at UF, Meyer said, “I’m not going to talk about guys (or) stuff like that.”Meyer declines to comment on reports of failed drug test by former WR HarvinTom Izzo said. “That’s an easy statement to 
make.”
The Tar Heels (34-4) were up 55-34 at half-
time, breaking a 42-year-old title-game re-cord for biggest lead at the break and setting 
the mark for most points at the half.
“We handled injuries, handled some loss-
es,” Williams said. “The youngsters standing 
behind me are great, great young men. I’m the luckiest coach in America, I can tell you that.”
This collection of NBA talent was too, too 
much from wire to wire, from the start of the tournament to the very end.
North Carolina won every game by dou-
ble digits, something that hasn’t happened since Duke did it in 2001.
Lots of basketball fans saw this coming, in-
cluding America’s No. 1 Hoopster-in-Chief.
Yes, President Barack Obama picked the 
Tar Heels to take it all in his much-publicized bracket.
Magic Johnson, Michigan State’s Spartan-
in-Chief, joined Larry Bird at center court to present the game ball, a tribute to the 30-year anniversary of their historic matchup and Michigan State’s first title.
From there, it was pretty much all “Show-
time” all the time — but not for Michigan 
State. Heck, Magic didn’t even stick around 
for the end of the game. He was spotted walk-ing up the tunnel with 3 1/2 minutes left.
Izzo tried to call a timeout to stop the onslaught with 6:45 left in the first half. His team came out and promptly turned it over — one of 14 in the first half, compared to only 12 baskets.
Goran Suton led the Spartans with 17 
points, and Kalin Lucas, the Big Ten Confer-ence player of the year, had 14 — most scored once the game was out of hand. Michigan 
State pulled within 13 a couple times late in 
the second half, and the crowd of 72,922 — mostly pulling for the Spartans — tried to make some noise. North Carolina runs through tournament with double-digit wins in each gamenings of work, and — with a 7-run lead — did not come 
back out for the sixth. O’Sullivan sent Keating out to keep the Commodores at bay and allow the Gators to leave 
Nashville, Tenn., with a series win.
Keating’s one-inning performance did not make a very 
strong case to keep him in the rotation, as he allowed 3 
runs and gave Vanderbilt hope in what appeared to be a  
UF blowout. Vanderbilt went on to score another 11 runs 
on its way to a 16-9 victory in the game and a 2-1 victory in the series.
With his chances running out, Keating must begin to 
work his way back to Friday starts with a strong outing against Bethune-Cookman. Otherwise, he could find him-self in the bullpen waiting for another starter to slip up before he’s given another opportunity to start.Keating to get shot at

It looks like winning could be 
on the horizon for the Gators.
After their first top-three finish 
in their last tournament on March 
25, the No. 30 UF women’s golf 
team put itself in position to repeat 
the feat and possibly win their first tournament of the year.
Monday, the team finished the 
first two rounds of the Lady Gator Invitational in third place with a team score of 46 over par, just three shots behind first-place Duke and Alabama.But the Gators aren’t satisfied.
“It does feel good, but we all 
had higher expectations,” fresh-
man Andrea Watts said. “We wanted to be leading this tourna-ment going in to the last day.”
Although no UF golfer had a 
great round, three Gators finished in the top 12 individually.
Watts had the lowest score of 
the day for the team at 8 over par. She was consistent and shot 4 over par in each of the rounds Monday, and she is tied for fifth overall.
Jessica Yadloczky finished the 
day with a score of 10 over par. Al-though her play was not as good as usual, it was still good enough for 
a share of the ninth-best individual 
score.
The final piece of the trio was 
freshman Evan 
Jensen, who shot 11 over par Mon-day. Despite a tough first-round score of 9 over 
par, she bounced 
back with a score of 2 over par in the second round 
and is in 12th place overall.
The success of Watts, Yadlocz-
ky and Jensen were reflected in the team’s score.
“We all put enough into con-
tributing to the team, and the more we can help, the better we’re off,” Watts said.
With one more round to play 
today, the Gators will start the day just three shots behind first place.
Although this team has never 
been so close to victory before, it 
knows that only a tournament win 
would be success.
“We’ve never been this close to 
a win before,” Watts said. “We can all taste it, and we want it so bad.”
MEN’S STRUGGLES CONTINUE: Just 
when they thought it couldn’t get worse, it did.
The No. 5 UF men’s golf team 
fell to 14th place after a team score 
of 26 over par in the second round of the U.S. Collegiate Champion-ship in Atlanta. 
With a combined score of 34 
over par over the first two rounds, the Gators are 31 strokes behind first-place Stanford. 
None of the UF golfers has a 
tournament score under par.
The closest is senior Billy 
Horschel’s score of 3 over par. While he was 2 under par after the first round, he struggled on Mon-day with a score of 5 over par.

So far in spring practice, 
Gators are dropping like flies.
UF entered the spring with 18 
players listed as limited or out, 
and a few more names have been tacked on to that list recently.
Freshman tight end Desmond 
Parks suffered a sprained knee in practice Monday, and he had to be carted off the field. Before Parks was driven away, coach Ur-ban Meyer went over and spoke with him to keep his spirits up.
“He’s a young player with 
eyes like saucers right now be-tween academics and football,” Meyer said. “He’s a such a great kid. I love that guy. It’s not the 
injury — everyone gets hurt — 
it’s about how an athlete deals 
with the injury. I grabbed him on his way off and I’ll go talk to him again (after practice).”
The Gators already lack depth 
at the position, where Parks is the only viable backup for starter Aaron Hernandez. If Parks’ inju-ry is serious, Meyer said he may 
use fullbacks T.J. Pridemore and 
Steven Wilks to fill the void be-
hind Hernandez.
“We might go without a tight 
end,” Meyer said. “We don’t play a tight end in tight. We play the guy that moves around. Right now, T.J. Pridemore has made 
great strides, and Steve Wilks is 
even showing a pulse. (New tight 
ends coach) Brian White is doing a great job with those guys be-cause a week ago, it bordered on 
comical.”
Wide receiver David Nelson 
sprained his right foot during 
Saturday’s scrimmage. He was on crutches Monday, but Meyer 
expects him to be fine. Fellow

DETROIT — There was a team of destiny out 
there, all right. It’s the North Carolina Tar Heels, 
and the final chapter of their story was about as heartwarming as a demolition derby.
Tyler Hansbrough, Ty Lawson and North Caro-
lina won a national championship a season or more in the making, stomping out Michigan State’s inspi-rational run Monday night with an 89-72 blowout that wasn’t even that close.
Hansbrough scored 18 points, Wayne Elling-
ton had 19 and Lawson led all scorers with 21 and also had a record eight steals — and now they and Danny Green can all head to the NBA feeling good about their decision to return to school to bring 
home Carolina’s fifth championship, and the sec-
ond for coach Roy Williams.
All those upperclassmen, save Hansbrough, 
came back in part because their draft prospects didn’t look so good. They also didn’t want their college careers to end on last year’s embarrassing loss to Kansas in the Final Four. That was a dud of a game in which they trailed 40-12 in the first half and Billy Packer was telling CBS viewers it was over.
This time, North Carolina led 36-13 around the 
time “Dancing With The Stars” was starting on an-other network. At least nobody knew how that one was going to end.
“We’ve been working so hard since last year 
when we fell short,” said Ellington, who was named 
most outstanding player. “I wanted to redeem my-
self. We worked so hard.”
Michigan State (31-7) simply never got any mo-
mentum. From the start, it was clear there was no way Carolina was losing control of this one, no chance for the Spartans to serve up that definitive ray of sunshine and warm-and-fuzzy smile for a state that’s been battered by the ailing economy.

At the start of the season, the Gators 
had one sure thing in their starting rota-
tion, and that was their ace, Patrick Keat-
ing.
Now, he is struggling to hang on to a 
spot in the starting rotation.
When UF (19-11) takes on Bethune-
Cookman (15-15) tonight at 6:30 in 
Gainesville, Keating (2-3, 5.44 ERA) will have another chance to get back on track, and it may be his last. 
He will take the mound at the start of the game, but another poor outing could send him out of the rotation for a while.
Following a bad start against Ala-
bama on March 29 — Keating lasted just 
3 1/3 innings and allowed 5 runs — UF 
coach Kevin O’Sullivan spoke about pos-sible changes to the rotation and even ad-dressed Keating’s situation directly.
“I’m going to tell Patrick that he’s go-
ing to be one of our guys,” O’Sullivan said. “He’s just going through a tough time, but he’ll battle through it. He’s a tough kid, and he will get through it.”
Throughout the week, O’Sullivan said 
he had not decided on any changes to the rotation, but his decision on whether Keating would start the final game of the series at Vanderbilt depended on how the rest of the series went.
The Gators and the Commodores were 
even at 1-1 after the first two games of the series, and Keating had yet to throw in a game. It should have been a lock for O’Sullivan to turn to his preseason ace for 
the deciding game in a conference match-
up.
Instead, O’Sullivan chose to go with 
Stephen Locke, who was reinstated fewer than two weeks ago after being kicked off 
the team before the season began.
