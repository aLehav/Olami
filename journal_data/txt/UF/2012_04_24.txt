Karen Edmonds leads a pack of cyclists past the Fine Arts building Monday afternoon. The Florida 
Cycling club organized the 12-mile ride to honor Edmonds’ late brother, Michael Edmonds.
IN MEMORIAM

Turlington Plaza onto Stadium Road.
A pack of cyclists funneled out on Mon-
day evening, and one of the smallest women in the group led the stream.
It was Karen Edmonds on her Trek 5200, 
the one her brother, Michael, found online back in 2007.
The bike, and the ride, was a link to the 
brother she lost. On April 16, Michael took his own life, falling from Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium.
“It was our thing together,” she said. “It’s 
hard because I know we’ll never get to ride together. I just wish I could ride with him again.”
He called her the day she got the bike — 
can you meet me in ﬁ  ve minutes? — and hag-gled with the seller until the price dropped to $900. I still can’t afford it, Karen said. For her, Michael paid.
“You’ll get me back later,” he said.East on Stadium Road, east through North-
west 13th Street. Onto Southwest Fourth Av-enue.
A state champion in the 3,200 meters at 
Clay High School, Karen was the family athlete. But six or seven years ago, when he wanted to lose weight, Michael asked for help. She introduced him to cycling, and he soon lost more than 100 pounds.
Michael and Karen biked together al-
most up to the day he died. They planned to ride this Monday , when Karen had a day off from her bartending job at Miller’s Ale House in Jacksonville.
But their ride was called off.Michael’s death was the end of a three-
year struggle with bipolar disorder, a dis-ease that at times changed the kid who painted himself blue and ran shirtless down the sidelines at high school football games, the kid who took joy in buying his family extravagant gifts.
Like Gators’ national championship tick-
ets for his dad. Or a bike for Karen.
Karen rode Monday despite the absence 
of her little brother. She rode for him. The Team Florida Cycling club organized a 12-mile ride to honor their fallen teammate, and more than 100 people participated.
Down Southwest Fourth Avenue, past Sixth 
Street, past Main Street, past the Hippodrome State Theater.
Karen visited Michael three weekends 
ago. After watching the Florida Relays track meet, they went to Boca Fiesta. He made her eat gator tail.
Michael grew up a Gators fan. In Green 
Cove Springs, his whole family rooted for Florida, all 40 cousins and aunts and grand-parents. After high school, he enrolled at Florida State College, where his mother said he kept a 4.0 GPA.
Last February , he called his dad. I got Students bike to remember Michael Edmonds

Aundre Price wanted to join the most 
prestigious student honor society at UF.
The African-American student has 
been involved since he arrived on campus 
in Fall 2009. He’s been a senator, a com-mittee chair and is now Student Senate President.
He is a UF Reitz Scholar and a rising 
member of the Unite Party.
Many Student Government ofﬁ  cials 
were surprised to ﬁ  nd that Aundre Price was not selected to join Florida Blue Key.
The prestigious leadership honorary 
comprised of UF students keeps limits on the number of students from minority stu-dent organizations and Greek organiza-tions that are allowed to join, an Alligator investigation has learned.

Gov. Rick Scott vetoed a bill Friday that 
would have allowed UF to self-insure all of 
its employees.
House Bill 5009 would have created Ga-
torCare, a standardized health insurance plan for all beneﬁ  ts-eligible employees and their families, including those outside of Gainesville.
“We’re disappointed, because I think it 
might have been a beneﬁ  t to the faculty ,” said Faculty Senate Chairman Scott Nygren.
The proposed plan would have improved 
workers’ health and been more cost-effective, according to a post by Paula Fussell, Human Resource Services vice president, on UF’s health care website.
In his veto letter, Scott said he was con-
cerned the ﬁ  nancial impacts had not been fully considered.
“I commend the University of Florida for 
seeking methods to be cost-efﬁ  cient,” Scott said. “However, I must balance the ﬁ  nancial interests of the university against the ﬁ  nancial interests of the other universities and state 
agencies participating in the state employee health insurance program.”
Nygren said UF will 
continue to work toward implementing GatorCare 
in a limited way . Some 16,000 employees — in-cluding Gainesville and 
Jacksonville Shands employees, graduate assistants and post-doctoral associates — are not affected by the veto.
“We’ll continue to argue for its implemen-
tation in the future,” he said.

ing the most recent application period in early 
April. Sources told the Alligator that a prede-termined number of students from each or -
ganization had been expected to get selected based on deals made among student leaders. In a similar vein, Greek organizations receive admissions to Blue Key and positions in UF Student Government based on agreements made by a small group of Greek student lead-ers, according to sources with knowledge of the process.
Weeks after he was not selected, Price 
wasn’t angry.
He feels that his future in leadership 
doesn’t rest on being a Key.
“Being in Florida Blue Key doesn’t make 
you any better of a leader,” he said. “If you’re not tapped, you just keep doing what you’re doing.”
� � �
For students aspiring to hold public office 
one day, the path seems simple.
Go to UF. Get involved in Student Gov-
ernment. Get tapped to join Florida Blue Key . Make the right connections.
Even students who have no taste for poli-
tics yearn to join the prestigious honor society that boasts alumni like former senator and Gov. Bob Graham and former Sen. Bill Nel-son.
The Alligator’s investigation shows the 
journey from wide-eyed freshman to seasoned campus politician can be tumultuous. It’s rid-dled with backroom deals to secure positions in SG, agreements to approve applications for Florida Blue Key based on Greek affiliations and handshakes that determine the future of campus politics.
Hovering over SG, Florida Blue Key and 
all of campus student life, is what is called the System.
The System is a fluid set of alliances gov-
erned by a select group of powerbrokers. Ver -
sions of the System have existed for decades, with the current iteration taking hold about seven years ago. It assigns power to a small group of campus leaders — members of five Greek organizations who have risen through the ranks — who have a hand in deciding everything from who gets to run for Student Body president to who gets tapped to join Florida Blue Key.
Most recently , the class of new Florida Blue 
Key initiates is nearly devoid of diversity . Of the 50 students selected in early April, six were members of what are called “the communi-ties” — Asian American Student Union, Black Student Union and Hispanic Student Asso-ciation. One student from the Asian Ameri-can Student Union, two from the Hispanic Student Association and three from the Black Student Union got into Blue Key , despite an understanding among leadership that more would be tapped.
“It’s a system that’s inherently unfair,” 
said one source with the Unite Party who is a minority . “We’re constantly at the bottom of the table begging for bread crumbs.”
Some say the System doesn’t foster racist 
tendencies as much as it bows to the power of votes in SG elections.
Alex Cornillie, former candidate for Stu-
dent Body president for the Students Party and an inactive brother of the Sigma Kappa fraternity , said the limits on tapping for Blue Key have nothing to do with race and every-thing to do with votes in SG elections.
“The function of Blue Key is to keep the 
particular groups of people in line for elec-tions,” he said.
He said the same system of rewards and 
punishments exists for any Greek organiza-tion.
“As far as rewards and punishments, it is based upon how loyal you are and how loyal you’re perceived as being,” he said.
In an email Monday , Florida Blue Key 
President Wesley Maul said the organization does not track admission based on organiza-tion affiliations.
“Many Florida students hold positions 
of responsibility and leadership throughout campus and the Gainesville community , but merely holding such a position doesn’t insure [sic] membership in Florida Blue Key ,” he wrote. “Our tapping process looks at a candi-date’s overall record of success and achieve-ment in determining his or her qualifications as a potential new member.”
He added that he and fellow Blue Key 
members are concerned with the diversity of the organization and the perception that it’s difficult for minority students or students in certain academic or campus organizations to qualify for membership.
“I don’t personally believe that’s the case, 
but perception can often be as important as reality,” he wrote.
� � �
Myra Morgan will tell you that when it 
comes to SG, she has seen and heard it all.
She was director of student activities for 
more than 20 years, becoming an unofficial adviser to SG and Florida Blue Key.
Arriving at UF in 1985, she said she was, 
at first, surprised at first at how much power SG wielded.
“It was a real eye-opener for me at the time 
that it was easier for the Student Body presi-dent to have access to the governor’s office than the university president,” she said.
She’s watched SG’s ups and downs for 
years, and she said she sees the politics as a microcosm of how real politics works.
The problems and perceptions arising now 
are not new. She says it’s cyclical.
“If people are feeling disenfranchised now, 
or that they think there’s too much influence with Blue Key and too much influence from fraternities, all that goes full-circle,” she said.
� � �
Florida Blue Key touts itself as Florida’s 
most prestigious honor society , boasting a rare collection of alumni that pepper the state’s major power brokers. Former gover -
nors such as Lawton Chiles and Bob Graham are alumni. Current Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives Dean Cannon, a former UF Student Body president, also hails from Blue Key.
But even dating back to the 1950s, the so-
ciety has, at times, found itself embroiled in controversy regarding its relationship to UF Student Government.
“There was a lot of emphasis on clandes-
tine activities,” Graham said.He recalled incidents of stealing copies of 
the Alligator on days the newspaper ran edi-torials supporting the non-Greek, non-Blue-Key-supported party and tapping phones to listen in on conversations of opposing parties.
“I never encountered, in state and federal 
politics, activities as aggressive as at the Uni-versity of Florida,” he said.
To him, the seedier aspects of campus poli-
tics served only to hurt future state leaders.
“If there were lessons taught, they were 
not good lessons,” he said.
He said he suspects that student politics 
has since cleaned up its act, and he feels stu-dents are smart enough to realize they should not be distracted by political sideshows.
More recently, U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasser -
man Schultz, D-Fla., chose to forge a path through SG outside of the System. During her time at UF in the 1980s, she successfully as-cended to Student Senate President and man-aged the campaign of a non-Greek Student Body president — all without support from the System.
“We had to run a more grassroots cam-
paign,” she said.
The parties she affiliated with never ex-
cluded members of the Greek community , she said, but the emphasis was less on rewarding affiliation and more on recognizing ability and qualifications.
Her independence didn’t come without 
strife. She recalled a time when she was in the SG offices and was cornered by a Greek-party Blue Key member who told her she had no future in Florida politics because he was going to block her acceptance into the honor society.
She said she never had an interest in Florida 
Blue Key . She now serves as the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee.
“I’m not in Florida Blue Key , and it seems 
like I did OK,” she said.
� � �
Sources have told the Alligator that votes 
for approving Blue Key applicants are based on several factors, including the merits of ap-plicants’ resumes and backroom deals struck to honor agreements with Greek houses and other student organizations.
In early April, several members of the mul-
ticultural communities had been given the im-pression by decision-makers that the majority of applicants from the communities would be tapped for the honor society.
According to sources, leaders from the five leading Greek organizations — Theta Chi, Sigma Phi Epsilon, Alpha Epsilon Phi, Sigma Alpha Epsilon and Alpha Epsilon Pi — decide who gets selected. These leaders, sources said, agreed to minimize the number of students selected from the communities this semester.
The rationale?One source from the communities said 
they are receiving the blame for the the slim victory in this semester’s SG elections.
“It’s supposed to be our fault that the mar -
gin was too small,” the source said.
The source said there isn’t anything wrong 
with having a system that breeds good cam-pus leaders, but it is flawed when the process for advancing is inherently unfair.
“They can only marginalize the communi-
ties for so long,” the source said.
Rising Student Body President Tj Villamil, 
a member of Sigma Phi Epsilon, said he is not aware of any connections between Florida Blue Key and Student Government, and he disapproves of any collusion to manipulate votes in Blue Key to favor some candidates over others.
“If that does happen, I denounce it,” he 
said. “I certainly don’t take part in it.”
Sources familiar with the tapping process 
said Villamil was part of the decision to tap fewer members of the multicultural commu-nities — an assertion Villamil denies.
“I don’t decide who gets tapped,” he said. 
“I just focus on SG.”
Wesley Maul, president of Florida Blue 
Key , wrote in an email Monday that Greek leaders have not influenced votes in the pro-cess of selecting members.
� � �
As director of Student Activities and In-
volvement, Nancy Chrystal-Green deals with all student organizations on campus, pro-viding support for more than 900 registered groups.
Greek chapters, Student Government and 
Florida Blue Key fall under her watch, but she said her office stays out of the selection pro-cess for new members.
Chris Loschiavo, assistant dean of students 
and director of student conduct and conflict resolution, said his office is available if stu-dents have issues with campus leaders that need mediation.
He added that getting involved might be 
the best way to handle problems with student leadership, especially for students who desire to be leaders.
“As a student leader, if you’re not happy 
with something that is happening in SG or in student leadership, you as a student leader have to figure out a way to take it on,” he said.
Chrystal-Green said she expects all stu-
dent organizations, including SG and Florida Blue Key , to choose the best students possible when selecting new members.
“That’s my expectation of any organiza-
tion, especially one that is as prestigious as Florida Blue Key,” she said.
Myra Morgan, former director of student 
activities, now works in the UF Division for Student Affairs as the director of external relations, but she still occasionally speaks to students who have questions or concerns re-garding SG.
She said when students complain to her 
about barriers to involvement, she asks them a series of questions.
“Did you vote? Did you go over and sign 
up to volunteer on a committee? Did you come forward with a project that you thought might be useful?”
Sometimes the answer is no.“Well then you know what, you have noth-
ing to complain about.”

former Florida governoraccepted, he said, I’m starting at 
Florida in August.
His parents say that day 
changed his life. After years of medication, years of switching from one pill to the next, swap-ping side effects like facial tics for constant exhaustion, Michael seemed to ﬁ  nd the cure. It was a simple acceptance letter.
Michael stopped taking his 
medication last November, though his parents didn’t ﬁ  nd out for a couple months. He seemed back to normal, his mother said.
Down University Avenue. East, 
east, east until there is no Univer-sity Avenue, until the road runs into Newnans Lake.
Karen used to ask Michael to 
proofread her papers. Who cared if she was in college and he was still in high school? He could write. It was gift.
When he arrived at UF, Mi-
chael chose to major in journalism. He loved telling stories, he used to write songs when he played gui-tar in high school.
His goal was to launch Manic, 
a magazine that dealt with The Beast, the mental illnesses that so few people really understood. But he wanted it to be much more. Manic would be politics. Manic would be art. Manic would be sports — gosh, would it be sports. Michael convinced his own fa-ther to switch loyalties from the 27-world-championship Yan-kees to the miserable Cubs.
Down Lake Shore Drive, up Haw-
thorne Road. Now, back on Southwest Fourth Avenue. Past Williston Road.
Go west on Williston, past I-75. 
It was there in February that Mi-chael was hit by a car while riding with Team Florida. He suffered broken vertebrae, was forced to wear a back brace.
His mother said she doesn’t 
know why , but it was then that Michael seemed to unravel. May-be he missed riding, his outlet. Maybe he needed his pills.
Michael tried to commit sui-
cide twice before. Once before he was diagnosed with bipolar dis-order and once after.
“He told his mother he didn’t 
want to do it,” said Mi-chael’s aunt Robin. “His 
mind made him make these plans. He couldn’t devi-ate. He couldn’t stop it.”
Down Southwest Fourth Avenue. 
Back to campus. To the Reitz Union.
The pack gathered at the Reitz 
Union Amphitheater at the end of the ride. They celebrated the man who lost out to an opponent they couldn’t quite understand.
He was funny, they said. He 
was dedicated. He was loving.
He was Mikey.Contact Tyler Jett at tjett@alliga-

86% NOMonday’s question: Did you go to 
Swampfest? 
It’s the end of the semester, and it’s been a crazy one. We’ve 
had elections at the university , local and national level. Rarely 
did we experience a slow news week on campus or around Gainesville. Calling it an eventful year so far would be an un-derstatement.
So, without further ado, we bring you our we-hope-we’ve-
made-you-think edition of...
Darts & Laurels
First up, we want to give a let-the-games-begin LAU-
REL to Mitt Romney, Barack Obama and (likely) Gary 
Johnson, who will all be gearing up for a general election 
campaign this summer.
But before we continue, we want to recognize those who 
have fallen during this semester’s primary battles: Mi-chelle “Mental-Retardation” Bachmann, Rick “Uhh, What Was I Saying?” Perry, Herman “9-9-9 Problems” Cain, Rick “That’s Not What I Meant To Say” Santorum and Newt “I Will Have My Moon Base” Gingrich.
This semester, we highlighted a lot of instances in which 
free speech came under attack.
Congress tried to shut down some online speech through 
SOPA/PIPA; state legislatures tried to criminalize “annoy-ing” posts on social networking sites; a southern university fired a student newspaper adviser over an obscene image; high school administrators threatened to exert control over the student newspaper due to a controversial column; and a district judge chastised a group of atheists for satirizing religious beliefs.
Therefore, we throw a trampling-all-over-the-First-
Amendment DART at all of the politicians, bureaucrats, 
school officials, judges and anyone else who tried to limit people’s free speech rights this year.
For everyone from the fall and spring semesters of this 
year who are moving on to bigger and better things, we give a congratulations-and-good-luck-with-all-of-your-en-deavors LAUREL to all of the graduating seniors.
Of course, we cannot end the semester without throw-
ing a just-when-you-thought-you-couldn’t-get-anymore-corrupt-you-go-and-do-something-like-this DART at Stu-
dent Government.
While we appreciate the fact that Jason Tiemeier apolo-
gized for throwing away newspapers, the fact that Katie Waldman, who knew about the incident but did not come forward, was eventually promoted to a higher position within SG is unacceptable.
Finally, we give a thank-you-for-giving-us-a-purpose 
LAUREL to the Alligator readers. Without our readers, 
there would be no point in doing what we do every week.
We also want to thank everyone who joined the discus-
sions on the website and sent in letters to the editor. We have certainly enjoyed the lively debates.
Have a fun and safe break, and be sure to check back 
next semester!We need to honor contracts to progress
Our daily, scheduled lives are strung together by a 
series of contracts between friends, strangers and ourselves   — contracts that we seem hesitant to 
honor. Whether it’s our turn to take out the trash or pay 
for a round at the bar, we dodge these agreements as often as possible.
You and I have an agreement.As a writer, I agree to provide a coherent, sincere, well-
thought-out article. My sincerity might manifest sarcasti-cally — as is often the case — but it persists nonetheless. As a reader, you agree to reserve judgment and analysis until you’ve read the article fully. Your judgment might be biased — as is often the case — but it is fair, nonetheless, as long as you take the argument as a whole and not by its individual parts.
Too often, however, we fail to uphold this contract.I might make a claim without sufficient justification or 
fail to include a link that would otherwise strengthen and clarify my train of thought. You might read only the head-line, the first or concluding paragraph, isolate a claim and dismiss it as asinine.
But as harmless as these individual lapses may be, their 
sweeping presence splinters and corrodes the progress of our social relationships.
One of the reasons free time is so satisfying is that we 
have no contracts to uphold, and we feel no guilt in our indulgence, overindulgence or excessive overindulgence until the time comes to again honor an agreement.
Many of us aren’t working to support ourselves through 
college. We rely on grants, scholarships and the support of our parents to fund car loans, grocery bills, rent and tu-ition. Each of these entails a contract. And yet, while the contract would read something like, “You get an educa-tion, we’ll pay for you,” we continuously fail to maintain our end of the bargain.
Instead, we buy beer, tickets, Coke and drinks for peo-
ple we’d hardly talk to if the lighting weren’t so dim. We spend money on TutoringZone and Smokin’Notes to create the illusion that we’re keeping the contract while pissing our work ethic and last night’s shame into the toilet.
Borrowing money entails a 
recognizable contract. If you spot me $5, I’ll say something like, “I’ll get you back.” But chances 
are I won’t get you back, and I’m sure you wouldn’t “get me back” unless I asked you. It’s not until we are confront-ed, put on the spot, that we uphold our half of the contract. Even then, sometimes an excuse is inevitable.
It always seems to be the party with the advantage that 
falls short. If we have something to lose from upholding a contract — something other than our integrity, that is — we avoid it at all costs. We’ll avoid texts, topics and eye contact, if that’s what it takes.
This collective habit is more destructive and more 
alienating than most of the less virtuous leanings of our society. It seems to manifest from an inherent dog-eat-dog mentality that festers in our culture. I’ll do what’s right for you only if it benefits me. Is there any more primitive, regressive mindset? Sure, but my point still stands.
If we intend to leave this world better than it was when 
we arrived, we have to abandon this way of thinking and generate social progression that is worthy company for the technological advancements of our age.
Albert Camus asked us to walk beside him and be his 
friend. Not in front, not behind, but beside in trust and col-lective progress. What kind of society are we creating if we can’t walk beside one another, upholding simple, some-times tedious, contracts with strangers and friends?

opinions@alligator.orgLetters to the Editor TUESDAY, APRIL 24, 2012  ALLIGATOR, 7
Preconceived religious notions warrant a 
fresh look 
I recently ﬁ  nished reading a newly pub-
lished book by religious scholar Lee C. Camp 
titled, “Who is My Enemy? Questions Ameri-can Christians Must Face about Islam — and Themselves.” I’m not Christian, but I wanted to read this book because I’ve been attending interfaith sessions with the Gainesville Men-nonite Church and have learned a lot about Christianity.
Camp examines both Christian and Islamic 
views on war, terrorism and peacemaking. He uses a technique called “double vision” whereby we seek to understand rather than be understood. This technique allows us to look at things from another perspective, namely the perspective of our “enemies.”
He elaborates on the notion that the teach-
ings of Jesus are apolitical, such as, “love thy enemy” or “turn the other cheek,” whereas the teachings of Mohammed are political. He argues that, ultimately , both individuals preached a political message: one that ad-dressed questions regarding the practices and expectations that govern their life together.
He also ﬁ  nds similarities in the Christian 
just war tradition and Islamic notion of only going to war for defensive reasons. The latter view maintains that justice sometimes requires armed force and war; for the purpose of estab-lishing justice and peace, war is permitted, if not required. The former, according to Camp, argues that war should not be entered hastily but as a last resort when nonviolent methods have failed. The goal is not war-making itself but an establishment of a relative peace. Ap-propriate treatment must be given to those defeated in war.
We need to confront our own prejudices 
and respond to different religious groups faithfully. Our generation needs to continually be tolerant of others but critical as well to im-prove the world we live in.
If we never want to talk with the so-called “enemy” or learn their point of view, how can we change the way things are in the world? We should not condone violence or hatred in any form, but we need to understand why certain groups of people may act in ways that seem so bizarre to us.
Read the book and learn, keep an open 
mind and understand why arguments such as “Christianity is superior to Islam,” or “Mus-lims are warmongers” or “all religions basical-ly say the same thing and are peaceable,” need to be addressed. Generally , these preconceived notions are wrong and need a fresh look.
Nora Zaki
Arabic and political science junior at UF
If you can recall, the ﬁ  rst column I wrote for the Alligator 
was about being a freshman spring admit here at UF.
While that still feels like last week, most of us are pack-
ing up our 60-square-foot living space and heading elsewhere for the summer. And just before we do that, we’re double-ﬁ  sting Starbucks and Smokin’Notes like our lives depend on it.
Just keep thinking: We’re in the homestretch.In the meantime, where did this semester go?Describing this past semester as “eventful” would be an 
understatement. To put it bluntly, the past four months have made for some pretty amusing Alligator headlines.
From “Police set trap for unclaimed monkey” to “Walk-
er must pay $300 for stolen taco,” these situations earn the “Meanwhile, in Gainesville” tagline.
As a student body, we’ve laughed, cried, rolled our eyes 
and shaken our ﬁ  sts at campus happenings exclusive to UF. We obsessively took our sentiments to the Web, where we “liked” and shared campus memes on Facebook, bitched about SOPA and PIPA, spread awareness about Joseph Kony and took sides on the Trayvon Martin case.
To sum it all up, here’s a little recap of a few things I’ll 
always remember about my ﬁ  rst semester as a Gator. Excuse me if I get a little senti-
mental.
Campus politics actually be-
came a real thing, and my vote was counted in one of the largest Stu-dent Government election turnouts in decades, all because an imma-ture Unite Party guy threw a hissy ﬁ  t and tossed a couple hundred newspapers in the trash … outside 
of the journalism school. What a sound idea.
In January, we woke up to the awful news of the Interstate 
75 accidents that claimed the lives of 11 people. Gainesville’s dense fog made national headlines as we mourned those who died on the road.
The Gator Nation held its breath as the Gators made their 
way to the Elite Eight during March Madness, only to fall short in the last quarter.
Then Erving Walker stole a taco.Recently, we lost a dear member of The Gator Nation. 
Even those who didn’t know Michael Edmonds, like myself, felt a sense of loss. But as always, the community banded to-gether and remembered this young man.As far as campus events go, we had some pretty inter-
esting visitors. Ron “F-ing” Swanson actor Nick Offerman played guitar and wore a tacky shirt; Seth Meyers turned out not to be Jewish after all; Billy Joel did his “Piano Man” thing; Rudy Giuliani got yelled at by conspiracy theorists; and Erin Andrews refused a few dates from horny undergraduates.
So, coming full-circle since my ﬁ  rst week of cluelessly 
walking around campus in January, my list of things I’ve learned keeps growing.
The newest addition to my list is that when you receive a 
UF alert, take it seriously.
Next year I’ll lose the stigma of “freshman” and gradu-
ate to the underwhelming title of “sophomore” or “second-year.” Bleh.
A big congrats to all those graduating in May. Whether 
you’re off to pursue another degree or enter the scary real world, the one that grown-ups talk about with jobs and sala-ries, I wish you the best of luck.
To those returning for round two (or three, or four or sev-
en) next year, be safe and have a just-as-eventful summer.
Go Gators!Colleen Wright is a journalism freshman at UF. Her column

� FLORIDA PLAYS SOUTH 
FLORIDA TONIGHT AT 7 AT MCKETHAN STADIUM.
BRYAN HOLT
Alligator Writer
 
Austin Maddox had just 
thrown 61 pitches, the highest 
single-game total of his UF ca-reer. 
He had worked 5.2 scoreless 
innings to help stretch a 16-in-ning Friday night game into early Saturday morning. The question was posed: Do you think you’ll be ready for Sunday?
“We’ll see,” Maddox said. “I 
might be a little sore [Saturday], but my arm usually bounces back good.”Less than 48 hours later, he 
was back on the mound to claim his 11th save of the season in a series-clinching win against Georgia. This one only took eight pitches. 
Florida coach Kevin O’Sullivan 
wasn’t surprised by how Maddox responded. He wasn’t surprised by fellow relief pitchers Greg Larson or Steven Rodriguez, ei-ther. They combined to throw six innings on Friday and were right back to combine for four on Sun-day. 
This has become the norm for 
No. 5 Florida (31-9), which faces South Florida (27-14) tonight at 7 at McKethan Stadium. 
“I said that before the season: 
I’m not going to be afraid to ex-tend those guys as the season goes on,” O’Sullivan said. “It gives them more experience.”
Injuries to junior Hudson 
Randall and sophomore Karsten Whitson, who has recently been moved to the bullpen, have made the Gators’ pitching staff vulner -
able. With less consistency from starters, Florida has had to risk testing relief arms well before the postseason begins. 
Randall and Whitson led the 
Gators last season in innings pitched with 124.1 and 97.1, re-spectively. But Whitson now car -
ries a 5.11 ERA in 12.1 innings of work, and Randall missed two starts with a “tired arm.” He was pulled after three innings and 45 pitches in his Sunday return to the mound.
Florida has 16 regular-season 
games remaining, and its reliance on Larson, Maddox and Rodri-guez is clear. 
Both Maddox and Rodriguez 
have already thrown more in-nings and pitches this year than they did all of last season, post-season included. Maddox’s work-load increase is the most drastic. His 42.2 innings are 15.2 more than he notched as a sophomore and his 533 pitches are 173 more than he threw in 2011. 
Plenty of variables play into Maddox’s role change. Last sea-son was his first as a collegiate pitcher, and he started 62 games as a position player. He has been in the starting lineup for just 11 of Florida’s 40 games in 2012. 
Maddox is one of only two 
players who has recorded a save for the Gators this year. That number was six in 2011, but Nick Maronde, Tommy Toledo, Anthony DeSclafani and Matt Campbell have all moved on to minor-league baseball. 
Rodriguez has become Flori-
da’s multi-inning specialist. He has thrown two or more innings 12 times this season — up from five in 2011. His numbers are gaudy: 52 strikeouts compared to six walks in 38.2 innings. 
“When you got seven or eight 
outs to go and you got Whitson, Rodriguez and Maddox you feel pretty good about your pitch-ing,” O’Sullivan said. 
Known for conserving arms, 
O’Sullivan said the progression is natural. After Larson, Mad-dox and Rodriguez, Florida’s bullpen consists of five freshmen and four sophomores. The bal-ance from a year ago isn’t there. Maronde, Toledo and DeSclafani helped carry the Gators in 2011, but none of them pitched more than 43.2 innings during the en-tire season. 
In big spots, O’Sullivan will 
continue to look the way of his three upperclassmen and feel confident about what he will get from them.
“We’ve taken care of their 
arms,” he said. “We’ve been care-ful with those guys. We haven’t overused them.”

The Gators’ postseason journey will only go as far as 
their timely hitting takes them. 
Florida plays a doubleheader beginning tonight at 
5 against LSU with a focus on driving home runners in 
scoring position. Although Florida swept Florida Interna-tional in a three-game set this past weekend, the Gators struggled with runners on base.
In three games, Florida left 24 runners on base and 17 
of those runners were in scoring position. And on two separate occasions, the Gators ended the inning with the bags full.Coach Tim Walton said his team needs to improve the 
situational hitting aspect of the game in time for the post-
season, which begins May 10.
“We did a poor job with the bases 
loaded,” Walton said after Friday’s 
games. 
“Look at our overall stats on the sea-
son, and bases loaded has been one of our statistics that isn’t very good. And we’re going to have to get better at that. It’s maybe the wrong hitters up at the 
wrong time, that’s sometimes the key.”
Tonight’s doubleheader marks the beginning of an 
eight-game stint against Southeastern Conference schools, and as the schedule winds to an end, every runner be-comes more valuable. 
Walton has adjusted his lineup multiple times to com-
bat a poor batting average with runners in scoring posi-tion. 
With just eight games left, Walton has still not found 
the lineup that will most efficiently drive runners home.
“It comes and goes, hits and clutch hits and stuff like 
that,” junior Ensley Gammel said. “So you always just go cheer for your teammates and stuff, and know you’re go-ing to catch a break sometime.”
But the Gators were helped on offense this weekend in UF concerned with stranded runners as postseason approaches

UF shortstop Cheyenne Coyle runs to third against Chattanooga on March 
14. Florida has struggled of late to drive in runners in scoring position.
UF facing tougher opposition down stretch
part by the Panthers’ pitching staff, which ranked 
124th in the nation with a 3.11 ERA on April 16. 
Two of Florida’s next three opponents, LSU and 
Alabama, are ranked in the top 20 in the country in earned run average.
“We’re facing some of the best pitching in the 
SEC with the remainder of our schedule,” Walton said on April 15. “It’s going to be tough. We’re probably not going to be getting as many hits as we’re accustomed to getting. So we’re going to have learn to deal with the failure part of the game but really learn to (situationally) hit, being able to execute.”
Freshman Lauren Haeger said hitting with run-
ners on can be a challenge at times. Because hit-ting with fellow teammates on second and third base is such a vital part of the game, Walton makes sure to go over it while the team is training.
“We do a lot of situational hitting in practice 
all the time,” Haeger said. “So, it stinks when it doesn’t work out as well. But we know we can make up for it in the end.”
And during the Gators’ six-game winning 
streak, they have been able to overcome their early struggles of hitting with runners on. Despite leav-ing an additional 21 runners aboard, including 11 in scoring position, Florida swept Auburn before facing off against FIU.
But the Gators outscoring their opponents 34-
10 in the past six games should not be an indica-tion of what to expect against the Tigers. Out of all the teams in the SEC, LSU has given Florida the most problems by winning 28 of the 46 games played between the two schools.
“We’ve got a challenge,” Walton said. “We’ve 
never talked about what’s at stake. We’re just try-ing to get better and hopefully make a great run for the postseason.”

UF softball coach A look at UF’s woes hitting 
with runners in scoring position during 
its six-game winning streak
- In Florida’s three-game series against Florida 
International, the Gators hit 9 for 36, or .250, with runners in scoring position. 
- During the past six games, the Gators have hit 
a full 63 points lower with runners in scoring position than their season average of .313. 
- The number of runners left in scoring position 
for Florida has increased since playing UCF on April 11. UCF: 25 percent left on base were in scoring position.Auburn : 52 percent left on base were in scor-
ing position. FIU: 71 percent left on base were in scoring position.

For the first time since 2006, no Florida 
players are projected to be picked in the first 
32 picks of Thursday’s NFL Draft.
That means no handshakes or hugs with 
Roger Goodell. No smiles inside Radio City Music Hall. And for Gators coach Will Mus-champ, no satisfaction. 
After winning 49 games and two nation-
al championships from 2006-09, Florida had 23 players selected, including seven in the first round and three in 2010 alone.
“We need to do a better job recruiting, 
need to do a better job evaluating, need to do a better job developing our players and coaching, that’s the bottom line,” Mus-champ said. “We need more guys involved in that, and that self-evaluation sometimes is a hard thing, evaluate where you are as a program. But that’s the facts, and that’s the way it is.”
Coming off a 7-6 season, Florida’s best 
draft-eligible prospect is do-everything run-ning back Chris Rainey.
After amassing nearly 1,500 all-purpose 
yards as a fifth-year senior, Rainey is look-ing to show potential suitors he is multi-dimensional and can help out in the pass game as well as out of the backfield.
He led an anemic Gators offense in re-
ceptions last season, hauling in 31 catches for 381 yards, and has put in extra work with Tom Shaw in Orlando in hopes of tai-loring his game after New England Patriots receiver Wes Welker or former teammate and current Minnesota Vikings receiver Percy Harvin. 
Rainey ran a 4.3 40-yard dash at Florida’s 
pro day on March 13, leading Jacksonville Jaguars head coach Mike Mularkey to say he thought Rainey and Harvin possess similar attributes. Rainey said he felt he impressed onlookers during the workout, saying he wanted to “prove I had hands.”
Still, at 5-foot-8, 180 pounds, Rainey is not likely to be selected in the first two rounds, according to ESPN analyst Mel Kiper.
“When you look at Rainey, I think there’s 
speed and versatility, and he gives you the ability to do some things with him in this game. This is today’s football. Today’s NFL is different,” Kiper said. “Rainey can be moved around in offense and present some real matchup issues with his speed and help you on special teams, as well. I think he’s a third, fourth rounder.”
Defensive tackle Jaye Howard is just out-
side that projection, with most analysts hav-ing Howard slotted as a fifth- or sixth-round talent. At 6-foot-3, 301 pounds, Howard fac-es criticism for his inconsistency and a lack of strength and sound technique. Battling injuries and the depth chart, he struggled to stay on the field until his senior year.
After fighting to dispel the lazy tag that, 
at times, accompanied him, Howard said he realizes this is his one shot to prove other -
wise.
“You have to look at it like that,” he said. 
“It’s do or die. You only get one opportu-nity.”
But for wide receiver Deonte Thompson 
and quarterback John Brantley, their only chance is likely to come as an undrafted free agent. Thompson ran hand-timed 40-yard dash times of less than 4.3 seconds at UF’s pro day and his speed should attract teams, but anything more than a late-round flier would be surprising.
“I know I didn’t have the numbers some 
of these guys had, but I know what I can do,” Thompson said “I’m going to play in the league for a long time.”
For Muschamp, that’s the goal: Develop-
ing his players to play at the next level. And after taking over a depleted roster in his inaugural season, Muschamp is working to once again have the first round littered with Gators. After all, he said, it’s part of the job.
“That’s why we run the systems we run 
from a standpoint of offense and defense and special teams,” he said. “When they watch our tape there are no projections, there are no, ‘I wonder if he can do this with our offense or our defense.’ That’s part of the continual 365 days of preparing our players on and off the field for life after the University of Florida.”

2011 stats: 65 tackles, 10.0 tackles for loss, 5.5 sacks, four quarterback hurries, two fumble recoveriesProjection:  Mid- to late-round selectionJaye Howard DT
Analysis: Howard has made numerous impact, highlight-reel plays in his career,but questions about his consistency loom. He is quick off the snap and has been effective against the run, but hasn’t consistently been able to defeat blocks in one-on-one situations. He ran the second-fastest 40-yard dash of defensive tackles at the combine, but that never translated into more than flashes of pass rushing ability. Concerns about his work ethic were only enhanced by a pedestrian 24 reps on the bench press at the combine.

4.32 seconds  ●  Broad Jump:  125 inches

Analysis: Despite middling production in two seasons at Florida, Brantley has thepotential to latch on at the next level. He lacks mobility and pocket awareness anddoesn’t have as much experience as the average quarterback prospect. But withhis combination of above average arm strength and good short and intermediateaccuracy, some may view him as a developmental prospect.Analysis: Once an elite recruit, Thompson failed to live up to expectations inGainesville, proving to be an inconsistent target with a tendency to drop passes.While he is not likely to be selected, Thompson’s speed, athleticism and experi-ence on special teams could earn him a look as an undrafted free agent. 
Height: 5-foot-8  ●  Weight: 180 pounds  ●  40-Yard Dash:

Analysis: Rainey is a speedy perimeter threat who has the explosive playmaking ability to score any time he touches the ball. His cuts are quick and make him the type of elusive runner that is difficult to bring down in the open field. Still, his size makes it hard for him to block effectively or run between the tackles. He comes with red flags related to injuries and character, but his agility and ability in space will be appealing to teams who can afford to spend a pick on a luxury player.Brett Le Blanc / Alligator Staff
