See Story, Page 19. A UF PROFESSOR IS CALLING FOR A BAN 
ON ALCOHOLIC ENERGY DRINKS.
  By ALEXANDER KLAUSNER
 Alligator Writer
  
 It’s been called a “blackout in a can.” 
  Drinking its contents is about the equivalent of 
downing two-thirds of a bottle of wine plus a Red Bull or two. 
  Four Loko, along with other alcoholic energy 
drinks, is under ﬁ  re from UF toxicology professor Bruce Goldberger, who calls for the ban of all alco-
holic energy drinks.
  “We all believe 
there’s no place in 
the market for these 
beverages,” he said. 
“Since the publi-cation of [a letter Goldberger wrote to the FDA] and the 
investigation of the 
FDA, there have been instances of 
serious injury and 
death associated with the consump-tion of an alcoholic 
energy drink.” 
  Ramapo College 
of New Jersey de-
cided last week to outlaw the drink al-
together, even penal-
izing students who are 21 and older for having the drink on 
campus. 
  Goldberger said 
the drinks increase risky behavior and are particularly dangerous be-
cause they are marketed toward a younger, less 
mature audience. 
  The nature of the drink has created a lot of 
buzz, attracting college students who appreciate 
the $2.59 price tag. 
  To capitalize on the popularity of the drink, the 
drinks are now sold at the Neon Liger dance party at Spannk on Saturday nights. 
  “It’s honestly just because it’s a popularity 
thing,” said DJ Vijay Seixas, who runs the event. 
“It’s in the news — it’s everywhere. Four Loko 
right now is hot. There’s a lot of news about it, good and bad. It’s the best time to carry it.” 
  Seixas said he doesn’t drink it because it tastes 
bad, but he gets why others do.
  “People want to get junked as cheap as they 
can, and it’s one way to do it,” he said. “It’s the best of both worlds. It’s like having upwards and downwards. You’re getting drunk, but you also 
get a boost of energy.”
  Seixas said he would not agree with a ban on the 
drink because he believes that any large amount of 
alcohol, regardless of the caffeine content, would 
cause irresponsible behavior.
  UF pharmacology professor Paul Doering said  
he agrees that it is mainly the excessive amount of alcohol contained in alcoholic energy drinks that 
causes extreme behavior.
  “My major concern is that the caffeine would 
allow a person to stay awake longer and consume more alcohol than they would otherwise,” Doer-
ing said. 
  Doering said that the large amount of alcohol 
contained in one of these drinks could cause peo-
ple, especially those who chug drinks, to overdo 
it.
  “They can easily lose track of the quantity of 
alcohol that’s ingested, and if they drink that rap-
idly, it can creep up on a person and ambush them somewhere along the way,” he said. 
MUSKEGON TOWNSHIP , Mich. — Po-
lice say it was “bring your daughter to work” 
day for a woman they said took her 2-year-old girl with her when she broke into a west-ern Michigan home. Police in Muskegon County’s Muskegon Township said they ar-rested the woman and the woman’s mother after Saturday’s burglary.
Twenty-six-year-old Nicole Bugajski 
and 51-year-old Kimberly Mahnke were ar-raigned Monday on home invasion charges.Police told The Muskegon Chronicle an 
elderly man who lived at the house unsuc-cessfully tried to block the women’s vehicle with his pickup truck.
Police stopped the women’s vehicle near-
by and found Bugajski’s daughter inside. She’s now in protective custody.
No one answered the phone Tuesday 
night at the women’s home in Egelston Township.

  Gainesville police arrested 
three drivers for driving drunk 
early Wednesday morning, in-cluding one UF freshman.
  Cedric Manns, 31, was pulled 
over just after midnight for fol-
lowing too closely behind an-other car and consequently failed ﬁ  eld sobriety tests. He was given a Breathalyzer test and blew over 
the legal limit of .08 
at a .202, according 
to GPD reports.

was stopped for driving in and out of her lane on Northwest 13th Street at about 2:30 a.m. Hull blew a .149 when tested, the re-port stated.
  Shannon McCarthy, a 19-year-
old UF freshman, was pulled over at about 4 a.m. for driving the wrong way down Northwest 13th Street and also failed her sobriety tests. She blew a .234, about three times the legal limit, according to the report.
  Manns, Hull and McCarthy

� OPEN ACCESS WEEK WILL LAST 
UNTIL FRIDAY.
By ALEXANDER KLAUSNER
Alligator Writer
UF department heads are calling for free 
public access to online journal articles.
Open Access Week, which is being held 
on college campuses across the country, will 
last until Friday with events promoting free access to online academic journals. 
Three events have been scheduled to pro-
mote the push toward open access, including a seminar in the Reitz Union on Tuesday, where speakers from various UF depart-ments and colleges came to discuss the ben-
efit of free access to online journal articles. 
On Thursday, the Faculty Senate will be 
discussing the possibilities of open access 
journals. There will also be a webcast work-shop about open access law journals at the Levin College of Law at 9:30 a.m. “The advantage of open access is it gets 
the research out there very quickly, freely available to readers,” said Isabel Silver, di-
rector of academic outreach at the Smathers Libraries. “It’s available to anyone, anywhere 
at any time.” 
More than 90 countries worldwide are 
participating in Open Access Week.
One of the downsides of open access, 
according to UF graduate student Daniel 
Spade, is that the cost of free public access to these articles falls on the authors. 
UF’s Open Access Publishing Fund helps 
authors cover the increased publishing costs. 
Spade was the first student to receive 
funding from UF for open-access publish-ing.
“I think it’s a positive change in the way 
that academic papers and research papers are being published,” Spade said. “Your re-search findings are able to reach more people, and I think it’s truer to the spirit of academic science.”Week of events to tout free journal access to students

Perry McGriff, the Democratic 
candidate for the Florida Senate, is taking legal action over an at-tack advertisement endorsed by his opponent, the incumbent Re-
publican Sen. Steve Oelrich.
The advertisement, from the 
Republican Party of Florida and 
endorsed by Oelrich, says that McGriff “wants laws to protect illegal immigration.”
But Eric Conrad, deputy cam-
paign manager for McGriff, said the quote in the ad’s last seconds  
is a misstatement out of context. 
Conrad said the misstatement 
was taken from a speech McGriff 
delivered in which he said the federal government should be in charge of immigration issues. 
The McGriff campaign is tak-
ing action against the Oelrich campaign, the Republican Party 
of Florida and any television sta-
tion airing the advertisement.  Since this is not a candidate ad-vertisement subject to the Federal Communications Commission “no censorship rule,” an orga-
nization such as the Republican 
Party of Florida does not have a “right to command the use of broadcast facilities.”  This is based on a 1973 U.S. Supreme Court ruling, Columbia Broad-casting System Inc. v. Democratic National Committee. 
McGriff said if the govern-
ment doesn’t do something about 
illegal immigra-tion, it will cost state and local governments.
“Immigra-
tion is a priori-
ty that needs to be taken by the 
federal govern-
ment because it 
needs to be consistent from state to state,” McGriff said. 
Four televisions stations, 
WCJB, WGOX, WGLF and WNBW, which cover Florida Senate District 14, were hand-delivered cease and desist letters 
Sunday, Conrad said.

� THEY GAMBLE TWICE AS 
MUCH AS STUDENTS FROM OTHER STATES.
By MINA RADMAN
Alligator Contributing Writer
Florida college students are 
twice as likely as the general 
population to become compul-
sive gamblers, according to a 
new study.
The study, which was con-
ducted by the Florida Coun-
cil for Compulsive Gambling, gathered data from seven Flori-
da universities.
The council recommended 
that universities implement 
programs to help students who 
may have a gambling problem.
The UF Counseling and 
Wellness Center does not cur -
rently offer any services spe-
cifically dedicated to gambling problems, nor have they been 
contacted about establishing 
such a program, according to Dr. Shari Robinson, assistant 
director of outreach and con-
frontation.
“Clinically, if we were see-
ing a lot of this, we would need 
to offer a group or look into a 
program,” Robinson said. 
“As a staff, we have not 
come together and seen where 
it would be needed.”
The proposed program, 
called Students Against Gam-
bling Addiction, would ask 
university health and wellness 
officials to set up help lines, 
warning posters and support groups. 
Robinson said 
the wellness center 
would be interested in learning 
more about such a program.
And while she has seen a 
few gambling addictions in her 
own cases, she could not com-
ment on the university at large.
“I’m sure out of the 44 coun-
selors we have, people are 
working with students who have gambling problems,” Rob-inson said. 
“It’s safe to say that, but the 
prevalence of it I couldn’t tell 
you.” 
According to Pat Fowler, ex-
ecutive director for the Florida 
Council on Compulsive Gam-bling, the study found that young men who play online poker too frequently are the biggest concern.
But gambling addictions 
can also come from a variety 
of sources, including common 
pastimes such as fantasy foot-
ball, according to Fowler. 
The newfound freedom and 
independence of college life 
gives students the opportunity to play as much as they desire.
“College-age students are 
simply at a point in life where 
they are exploring and experi-
encing  a number of risk-taking 
behaviors,” Fowler said. “Gam-bling is just another one of those risk-taking behaviors.”Fla. students gamble more

SAN FRANCISCO — A fed-
eral appeals court on Wednes-
day temporarily granted the U.S. government’s request for a freeze on a judge’s order re-
quiring the military to allow 
openly gay troops.
A three-judge panel of 
the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals instructed lawyers for the gay rights group that brought the lawsuit success-fully challenging the “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy to file 
arguments in response by Monday.
The judges would then 
decide whether to extend 
the temporary stay while it considers the government’s appeal of U.S. District Judge Virginia Phillips’ ruling that the policy was unconstitu-tional.
It was unclear what effect 
the temporary freeze would 
have on the Pentagon, which 
has already informed recruit-ers to accept openly gay re-cruits and has suspended dis-charge proceedings for gay service members.Appeals court

143 TOTAL VOTESWednesday’s question: Are you going to the Florida-Geor -
gia game?Today’s question: Do you feel accepted at UF?
Acceptance a slow and individual process
UF student Nirav N. Patel was quoted Wednesday 
as saying “I feel like we’re still segregated here. It sucks being in an old southern school.” 
UF is an old southern school? I wasn’t aware of this. 
Granted, I was aware that geographically UF is south of the Mason-Dixon Line, and it’s existed for many years, thereby making it old. I’ve also noticed UF’s strong pen-
chant for tradition and human decency, which I suppose 
could be labeled southern values. 
If Mr. Patel’s characterization was anything but pain-
fully literal, I’m afraid he’s seriously mistaken.
If there’s anything my uber-conservative upbringing 
prepared me for, it was the horrors of liberal academia. Being a true Alachua County resident, I was given an outsider’s perspective on the kooky antics of the city of Gainesville and its bleeding liberal heart we affection-
ately refer to as UF. 
I’m not saying Mr. Patel isn’t entitled to his opinion, 
but I’m afraid this pick-up-driving simpleton’s view ren-
ders it utterly ridiculous.
First, let’s take a look at the city in which UF re-
sides, and therefore whose fate is symbiotically linked. Gainesville is a blue bastion in the Red Sea of conserva-tism that is North Central Florida. 
We have an openly gay mayor in the middle of the 
Bible Belt. And it’s certainly not UF itself that’s old and southern. All one needs to do is see the regard UF has for minorities and LGBT students to discover Gainesville’s stances are just the less radical outgrowths of UF’s posi-tions. 
UF dedicates incredible resources toward preventing 
and combating discrimination. Let’s not forget, class of ’13, what our suggested reading was for our freshman year: The Devil’s Highway, which was a work describing the plight of illegal immigrants who entrusted 
their lives to dangerous men paid 
to escort people across the border, sometimes abandon-
ing them and keeping the money. 
What’s far more important than all this, though, is UF 
and Gainesville do all these things out of genuine con-cern for people, rather than some bloated sense of politi-cal correctness. 
I’ll admit, yes, Gainesville still has its Dove World 
Outreach, and I’m sure discrimination still exists at UF 
on an individual basis, but in no way are those phenom-
ena encouraged by our policy or our community.
So what’s the real problem here? When are we going 
to achieve the utopian dream where all people are seen 
equally? The short answer is never.
I, for one, never want to see a world in which no dif-
ferences are drawn between individuals. Our differences 
are what make us interesting and unique and human. Sure, the natural tendency is for people to congregate 
with other people who look or speak or act similar to 
them, but that isn’t a failure of the human nature; it’s just a force to be counterbalanced with the realization of the worth in all people. 
What may be frustrating to some is the fact that this 
balance unfortunately has to be drawn personally; it can’t be forced onto some people. 
Ultimately it’s an individual choice, and all we can do 
is make that choice ourselves and encourage others to do 
the same.
Nate Rushing is a political science student. His column 
appears every Thursday. Limbo-gration
If a group of Republican 
lawmakers succeeds in its foolishly misguided 
endeavors, children of illegal immigrants might as well just 
put “Limbo” on their birth 
certificates. 
The group of lawmakers 
from 15 states wants to sort of toss out that unimportant 14th Amendment that unam-biguously says “all persons born or naturalized in the United States ... are citizens of 
the United States and of the 
state they reside.”
Except for those children 
who had no choice but to have the unfortunate circum-stance of being born to im-migrants who immigrated to the land of opportunity. No, these kids should rethink 
their constitutional rights. 
This group of lawmaker’s 
logic, if we can even call it 
such without tarnishing the very meaning of that word, is nonexistent. If a child is born in New Hampshire to villain-ous Canadian border jump-ers, he or she simply cannot be anything but an American citizen both by ordinary logic 
and legislation. 
To say interpreting the 
14th Amendment, originally 
designed to provide citizen-ship for former slaves, is to mar the legacy of black peo-ple in this country is a great folly in many regards. First, it is to say a great majority of 
black people actually want to 
remember the fact the coun-try they are so seemingly proud of once forced them into enslavement. We hardly call this a legacy. And sec-ondly, it is to explicitly deny a child the chance of reaching the true American dream. 
The thought of reinterpret-
ing the Constitution is not a radical idea. But the thought of reinterpreting to favor il-logical xenophobia is, indeed, radical and shameful. Coming Out
Legislators should 
embrace ruling
Virginia Phillips is quickly becoming the most powerful woman in America.
Eclipsing the power triumvirate that is Oprah, Sarah 
Palin and that woman in the Progressive commercials, Phil-lips has found herself shaking up the status quo and making 
front-page headlines across the country throughout the week 
and recent months. 
In the latest national, local and international front-page sto-
ry to spawn from her judicial chambers, openly gay military recruits in the U.S. cannot, for the first time, be turned away.
For now, at least.Phillips judicially drop kicked the Pentagon on Tuesday 
when she emphatically denied the government’s request to delay her order to suspend the as-she-has-called-it unconsti-
tutional Clinton-era policy. 
And when this brazen judge can pull some judicially fa-
tal Mortal Kombat action on the Department of Justice, we 
couldn’t be happier to see someone finally taking action on the policy Obama pledged to end on his watch. 
But one of the most jarringly disturbing quotations makes 
us realize the fight for gay servicemen and women to be able to fight for their country is long from over. “If you come out now, it can be used against you in the future by the Pentagon,” 
the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network warned. 
While we realize the DOJ is simply acting in accordance 
with adhering to legislation passed and supported by Con-
gress, therein lies the very problem.
The fact that a ruling to end such blatant discrimination has 
to come from a gavel rather than the Capitol because certain Republican senators (all of them) veto legislation to end the policy is despicable. 
Keep up the good work, Virginia.

Letters to the Editor
Column misdirects sentiments
Brian Amos is certainly right about one 
thing: Public education in this country is 
in shambles and is slipping even further year after year. However, in staying with general conservative folly, he attributes 
the cause of this to “big government” and 
the always-ambiguous threat of secular education. At least he makes no attempt to hide his intellectual provincialism, decry-ing even an an honest conversation about socialism. 
I think millions of people suffering 
through the crushing poverty they expe-rience in their capitalist nations would 
recognize the shortcomings he listed, al-
though they might place medicine before televisions. 
As far as the value of homeschooling, 
it’s easy to forget how often this system is used simply to indoctrinate children into an anti-science, creationist ideology that churns out conservative voters. 
The solution to our public education 
woes is as simple as it has always been: fund the schools. The money is available; it’s just poorly distributed too often to 
wasteful private interests. 
But Mr. Amos seems to think the op-
posite approach would work. He reminds 
me of Michael Behe, who received a Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania, only to spend his career embarrassing his alma mater with his “intelligent design” quack-ery. In fact, the two would probably get along.

Hoover, Tyler and Reagan were rated by scholars as the best three presidents. A 
review of polls done in the last 70 years 
show both Tyler and Hoover were ranked 
very poorly compared to other presidents 
while only Reagan managed to be in the 10th to 20th position overall. 
It’s also interesting the IQ test was first 
done in 1904, yet Jefferson tested at a 160 
as an adult in the 1700s.
Aside from this blatant disregard for 
making honest points, he moved on to 
discuss how he thinks socialism shortcom-
ings and benefits shouldn’t be discussed 
in the classroom if these presidents aren’t 
discussed.
Socialism is a widely discussed subject 
in this country, especially now, and it, 
along with other economic and political 
systems, should be understood to its full effects to avoid  ignorance throughout the country.
Also, not to stray from the point here, 
but he can’t find one benefit of social-ism? What about the fact that you have health care, food and shelter for everyone? Maybe if Brian had paid attention during 
that lesson he would have realized social-
ism, much like having everyone home-
schooled, is an impossibly ideal situation. He proposes we cut public education and homeschool our kids or take them to pri-
vate school. 
This would lead to a massive loss in our 
current workforce in that parents would 
have to stay home to watch kids, and it 
would only encourage an unfair system. 
By doing away with public schools, people making less money could not afford high-
quality education like the child with rich 
parents.
Lastly, it needs to be stated for Brian 
the blame of education in Florida does not fall on the Democrats’ shoulders as this 
has been an issue since the 1990s.

Abolish federal scholarships for the 
sake of equality
I completely agree with Mr. Amos. We 
must abolish federal scholarships. What use do they serve anyway? It’s not like any-one actually wins them based on merit. If Mr. Amos cannot win these, then we must remove them from existence. After all, isn’t making everything equal for every-one regardless of their abilities and hard work really what this country is about?

Columnist’s argument flawed
Brian Amos’ column shocked me by its 
blatant disregard of the facts. Ronald Rea-
gan, John Tyler and Herbert Hoover are 
not  first, second or third on the vast ma-
jority of scholars’ presidential rankings. A 
C-SPAN poll conducted in 2009 of presi-
dential historians had Reagan at 10, Tyler 
at a measly 35 and Hoover at a slightly 
better-than-measly 34. 
And how did Nicholas Gilman take an 
IQ test when he died 98 years before one had been invented? How can you expect someone to treat your argument as intel-ligent with such an obvious anachronism? 
I also have a hard time believing a ma-
jority of eighth-graders could not find the U.S. on a world map. I don’t know where Amos is getting his information from, but 
if he is the product of private education, 
I’ll stick with my unconstitutional, com-
munist public education.

Lack of whiny pop and Papa Roach good for UF
In response to Sean Quinn’s Wednesday 
column, I think Rock 104 changing format 
is just what this town’s radio monoculture needs.
Most towns and cities with colleges our 
size have at least one radio station that plays either independent and/or local mu-
sic. That Rock 104 was the best our town 
had to offer to college-aged rock lovers was pretty sad.
With both WUFT-FM stations (89.1 and 
103.7) changing formats, our town no lon-ger has a genuine jazz or classical station either. 
Audiophiles now are forced to choose 
between shallow tween pop and pop coun-try. As such, I say it’s high time, perhaps a la pirate radio, for something rebellious (read: listenable) to take to the airwaves in Rock 104’s place.
While I agree with Quinn reducing 
the diversity in our radio market is a cry-ing shame, I certainly won’t shed a tear knowing UF’s students won’t be hearing Jimmy Eat World or Papa Roach over the airwaves any time soon, and I don’t think Don McLean would either.

Jake Gave’s roommates don’t consider him violent.
Gave plays video games like “Halo” and “Call 
of Duty” every day for three hours. To him, it’s his 
primary hobby. But in two weeks, the U.S. Supreme 
Court will begin hearing a case that could determine 
whether the sale of those and other violent video 
games should be regulated by the government.
Schwarzenegger v. Entertainment Merchants As-
sociation, a case surrounding a California statute that would ban the sale of violent video games to minors, will go before the court on Nov . 2. The state argues that violent video games produce violent youth.
Paul Smith of Jenner & 
Block, a law firm from Wash-
ington, D.C., will testify on 
behalf of the entertainment 
industry , arguing that a state law restricting the sale of violent video games to minors violates the First Amendment right to free speech.
He explained his case to more than 250 people as 
part of a media ethics and law lecture series at U. Min-nesota on Monday evening.
A plethora of studies in the past decade has tried to 
make a connection between violence and video games, but such research has yielded results that are simply 
too vague, Smith said.

There’s a specific image that comes to 
mind when you picture a belly dancer: beaded 
bras, jingling coin skirts and perfectly toned stomachs.
She’s seductive, curvaceous, enchanting. 
She’s Esmeralda from “The Hunchback of Notre Dame.”
In many ways, this image fits Paige Recht-
man. She wears a bejeweled bra, a flowing skirt and a magenta flower in her hair. She’s a spit-ting image of grace, movement and beauty.
But this is an image Rechtman, 25, is hop-
ing to expand — one belly dancing class at a 
time.The UF graduate student offers a group fit-
ness class every Tuesday at the Student Rec-
reation and Fitness Center and every Sunday at the Southwest Recreation Center.
Women — and sometimes men — have lined 
up to learn the ways of the Middle Eastern tra-dition and work on their abs since the class started in the fall.
“There’s a huge misconception about belly 
dancing,” she said. “A lot of people, when they 
see it or hear about it, think it’s this very sex-
ual, sexy kind of dancing, which it can be, but it’s also very empowering for women, which is the kind I hope to bring to UF.”
Rechtman started belly dancing five 
years ago when she decided to take a class while studying at the University of Georgia. It changed her life.
Belly dancing has had such an impact on 
her that it partially influenced her decision to go to graduate school for mental health coun-seling, which is what brought her to UF. She plans on using her education to do research on the positive and negative effects belly dancing has on women.
Because the classes are new to UF, Recht-
man knows there will be belly dancing virgins and says she does her best to make everyone feel comfortable. Sometimes she even brings extra skirts and scarf wraps and lends them out on a first-come, first-served basis.
Plan on making it to Rechtman’s class or 
just want to try some moves at home? Take these tips with you to make your experience 
a success.

  The people behind some of Gainesville’s biggest 
parties have more on their minds than just having 
a good time. 
  The 35 20-somethings that make up ORI En-
tertainment, the event company that brought 
Gainesville the massive Big and Hearty Music and 
Art Festival and the A-N-D dance party series, can’t stop ﬁ  nding new ways to give back to the commu-nity.
  “It’s so important to us because we truly care,” 
said director Charlie Bilsker. “We care about what goes on in the future and helping positivity grow in general.”  ORI Entertainment was created about four years 
ago by coordinating director Ian Arnold, who said he started the company because he wanted to be in a business he enjoyed.   The company started with just himself and has continued to grow through the years. Bilsker came on board about two years ago, and now ORI is expanding its brand toward the bet-terment of Gainesville as a whole.
  The next A-N-D party is this Friday at the Florida 
School of Massage, and part of the proceeds from 
ticket sales are going toward the Save the Ta-tas 
Foundation, which funds breast cancer research. 
  But ORI isn’t content just being contributors to 
already existing organizations. Its next big project is ORI Educates, a program that will fund and cre-ate music and art programs at schools around the county.
  “We realized, in general, music and art programs 
are not really well-funded,” Bilsker said. “They leave 
it out like it’s not important, but music is essential 
to everyone.”
  Funding for the programs will come from cor-
porate sponsors and proﬁ  ts from ORI events, such as A-N-D parties. The company plans to buy instru-ments and art supplies as well as take an active part in creating the programs and making sure they create positive learning environments for the stu-dents involved.
  “We’re doing as much as possible to give kids 
options,” Bilsker said, “because we know science, English and math aren’t for everyone.”
  In the future, ORI plans to partner its education 
program with local companies so it can set older students up with internships, which will allow them the opportunity to apply their skills, such as ac-counting or law degrees, to work in the entertain-ment business.
    “My hope is to make a measurable difference,” 
he said. “There’s nothing more valuable in our com-munity than giving people an opportunity.   The more people in the community prosper at large, the more the community prospers.” 
  Tickets for the Save the Ta-tas Foundation bene-
ﬁ  t party are $15 at the gate and $10 online at www.orientertainment.com. thursday, october 21, 2010   ALLIGATOR, 9

 Like a G6
 Sometimes the best 
songs are the ones that 
don’t mean anything at all. Take 
“Like a G6,” an electro beat-sampling, fun, fresh track about being as “ﬂ  y” as a 
G6, which, if you didn’t know, is a private 
jet. Last week, it climbed to the No. 1 spot on iTunes and the No. 2 spot on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart. In this club-worthy tune, the Far East Movement spits silly verses about “poppin’ bottles in the ice like a blizzard” and “sippin’ sizzurp in my ride,” over a perfectly orchestrated mix of bleeps, blips, blurbs and blurps, 
making it absolutely impossible to not let 
loose and jam out.
 Paranormal 
Activity 2
  There’s still about a week 
until Halloween, but those whose appetite for horror can’t be satiated by ABC Family’s “13 Nights of Halloween” are sure to get their ﬁ  x this Friday. A follow-up to last 
year’s freaky documentary hit, “Paranormal 
Activity 2” is sure to produce just as many shrieks, gasps and horrors as did its predeces-sor – and probably make as much bank (the ﬁ  rst grossed $193 million worldwide). This time around, a young couple sets up video cameras around their house to catch what they suppose is a burglar. However, they soon ﬁ  nd the suspicious activity isn’t the 
work of burglars at all — but rather that of 
ghosts, spirits or something that just can’t be explained.    Gainesville’s 
Pride Parade &

 Celebrate Gainesville’s LGBT com-

After that, head to Gainesville’s Bo Diddley Community Plaza from 2 p.m. to 9 p.m., where the Pride Commu-nity Center of Gainesville will hold this year’s Pride Festival, which will feature local musical acts and vendors. The event is free and open to the public.go   Come Around 
Sundown
  Tennessee rockers Kings 
of Leon maintains its (reluctant) slot 
in mainstream rock with its ﬁ  fth studio 
album, which was released this week. The four-piece family band, which remained 
in obscurity for half a decade, gained 
attention among the masses in 2008 with pop-rock tunes like “Use Somebody” and “Sex on Fire,” facing its ﬁ  rst-time devoted followers, who claimed the band had sold out. But because we’re still on ﬁ  re from their last record, we’ll sing along no 
matter what.

  Dear Jared,
  I’m a female who constantly 
gets wet for most of the day. I’m al-
ways thinking of sex, yet I don’t get any. I need some feedback.
  Love,  Wet ‘n’ wild
  Before we begin, I need to 
express my gratitude you didn’t start out with, “I’m a 
male who gets wet for most of the day.” I don’t know if I even have the 
strength for that. 
  Secondly, I need to understand 
some basic hydrology and ﬂ  ow-per-
capita rates. Are we dealing with an Amazon River Basin situation or more of a Leaky Faucet Syn-drome? Because the difference between the two could spell out a bountiful harvest or oversaturated, 
destroyed crops. And the bounty 
between your loins is something we can’t risk leaving in the ﬁ  elds like Plant City strawberries. 
  And really, most of the day? Are you wearing d i a p e r s ? Are you con-sidering it?
  I’m sans vagina,  
but I can imagine the discomfort and awk-w a r d n e s s 
this is probably causing you as you inevitably have to pretend you’re 
wearing your still-damp-from-that-
awesome-swim-you-just-took bikini bottom under your jeans.
  Diagnosing damp down-below 
regions isn’t my forte. But as for your concern about thinking about sex all the time and not getting any? Honey, welcome inside the minds of nearly everyone you 
meet.
  Do you really think I’m ﬁ  xating 
100 percent of my attention on a 
professor’s drone about GDP when the surfer-cut-sporting hottie read-ing Orwell next to me in class ﬂ  ash-es me a grin that practically says, “Kiss me, I’m easy”?
  I can almost guarantee most of 
your classmates share this senti-
ment. 
  And one last concern before 
we part ways: Do certain things 
get you all hot and bothered? Be-cause we might also want to look into that if your stockings become a sauna for brick buildings and wheat germ. Irish accents, lip rings and V-necks, on the other hand, 
are totally acceptable in the turn-
on department.
  I imagine once you visit a 
health care provider to scope out your womanhood, you’ll be more conﬁ  dent in your abilities. And con-ﬁ  dence is the key to the doorway that is The Deed. 
  In the meantime, we heard Bed 
Bath & Beyond sells waterproof sheets.  
 Have a question for our resident 
sexpert? Send Jared an e-mail at 
Jmisner@alligator.org. Your name 
will not appear in print or online.

Drink up: Ring in the season with pumpkin ale   
  By RICHARD STEHLI
 alligator writer
   We won’t make you wait for the leaves to change 
colors to celebrate all the autumn season has to of-
fer. And that’s more than just candy corn and witch-
shaped lollipops — no offense, Halloween.
  As the weather cools down and the handful of 
deciduous trees around Gainesville start to get in the spirit, we know what you’re craving: pumpkin 
ale. The Avenue sampled some of these autumn-
ﬂ  avored brews and ranked them based on taste and seasonal spirit.
  Pumpkin-ish
  Blue Moon’s autumn offering is Harvest Moon, 
an ale brewed with pumpkin, nutmeg, clove and allspice. At ﬁ  rst taste you might just think you’re 
drinking a very tasty ale, but eventually you’ll 
start to detect faint but delicious notes of pump-kin and spice. Although subtle, it’s worth digging deep and searching for those fall-time ﬂ  avors.
The best thing about Harvest Moon is the color. 
Pour your beer into a tapered glass, and you’ll see all the hues of the season. At the skinny end of the glass, you’ll see a deep yellow, fading into reds and oranges across the middle, and at its deepest, a 
rich shade of brown. Hold your glass up to the light and feast your eyes — as well as your stomach — on 
your beverage. For someone who wants a good fall beer without a healthy serving of pumpkin, Harvest Moon is your weapon of choice.
  Pumpkin Perfection
  Buffalo Bill’s Pumpkin Ale strikes a good bal-
ance between seasonal ﬂ  avor and a full-bodied beer taste. The smell and taste bring out plenty of 
spice and pumpkin, but it backs it up with a qual-
ity beer. The taste is sweet and reminiscent of pie, with a rich, mellow aroma. For those who want a tasty but restrained pumpkin taste, Buffalo Bill’s 
Pumpkin Ale is your best bet. 
  Holy Pumpkin Patch 
For maximum pumpkin impact, grab a six-
pack of Shipyard Pumpkinhead Ale. Just as the 
headless horseman on the bottle screams Hal-
loween, Pumpkinhead Ale is pumpkin ﬂ  avor to 
the max. The beer pours out a light straw color with lots of carbonation, and from the ﬁ  rst sniff, all you’ll be able to think about is pumpkin pie.
You almost can’t call it a beer. It’s more of a pump-
kin soda. While I wouldn’t recommend Pumpkin-head to the serious beer fanatic, for those who are more concerned about holiday festivities than im-pressing their friends, stock up on this ale.

 avenue writer
  He’s got the face of an innocent angel, the voice of a 
pre-pubescent Backstreet Boy and a mane that shimmers 
like heaven’s rising sun. Yet, lusting after him feels like the 
ﬁ  lthiest of sins.
  Ever since Justin Bieber, 16, popped out of YouTube 
and into Usher’s beauteous arms, he’s had preteens on 
their knees and cougars salivating, counting down to March 1, 2012 — when getting down with Biebs won’t land you an orange jumpsuit and an intimate relationship with a jail-cell-sweetheart named Bernice. 
In the meantime, we want to get as close to Biebster’s 
bod as we can.   Thanks to OPI’s knack for satisfying this 
nation’s needs, we can enjoy the divo right at our ﬁ  nger-
tips — literally. Bieber has partnered with cosmetic brand Nicole by OPI to create a line of nail polish pinned “One Less Lonely Girl.” Sure, we’ll give the duo props for crafty polish names like “Me + Blue,” a metallic blue, and “Step 2 the Beat of my Heart,” a heart-shaped glitter number, but what in the world of bubblegum pop is going on here? 
While the little nugget is a man of multiple dimensions, 
including dancing, singing, acting, Tweeting and charming, 
he has no hand (no pun intended) in the tween beauty 
industry.
  Thus, the Avenue concocted our own list of celeb-in-spired rip-offs — erm, products — that would hit shelves in 
our perfect Tiger Beat world.
Jonas Brothers Massage Oil 
  The Jo Bros have made it no secret that they don 
promise rings to showcase their purity below. That’s obvi-ously why we want the trio to heat things up with some KY-inspired action. A warming oil, “Burnin’ Up,” would be the star of the line, followed by “Love is on its Way” — no explanation needed.
Miley Cyrus Lingerie  Not-so-innocent Miles has clearly burned her Hannah 
Montana wig and is about two steps away from sliding into X-tina’s assless chaps, so we ﬁ  gured we’d just capitalize on what everyone knows is coming. Cyrus is already Wal-mart’s princess with her Max Azria collaboration, but we want her to make her way back to the lair of lingerie a few aisles back.
  Justin Timberlake Lip Line  Truthfully, we’d be down for anything that involves our 
lips and JT. We’ve conjured up a whole spectacle for the man who brought sexy back with lip gloss, lip balm, cold sore treatments — the works. For the glossy shine, try “Cry me a Shimmer River,” “Bye Bye Bye Bumps” for the line’s Abbreva and “Rock your Balm” for the lip balm number. Avenue celeb dream-product picks 
The Verdict
The Avenue ranked pumpkin ales 
based on intensity of ﬂ  avor.

Anyone can belly dance: tips and tricks to get the shake in your hips
   1. Dress comfortably. Attire ranges from 
traditional belly dancing outﬁ  ts to jeans, 
T-shirts and sweatpants. The best belly 
dancers go barefoot, so leave your 
shoes at the door.   2. Enjoy all the beneﬁ  ts of belly dancing 
— not just the physical ones. Recht-
man said it’s all about the “mind, body, spirit” feel. “It can be very creative and expressive as a spiritual aspect,” she said. “It’s a great way to express hidden 
thoughts in the subconscious and just 
let go. It’s cathartic, just like writing poetry or playing music.”
3. Be prepared for a workout: Rechtman 
said belly dancing teaches students how to control and isolate different muscles in their stomachs while also toning the muscles of the arms and 
legs.
  4 . Look away from the mirror. When Re-
chtman ﬁ  rst started belly dancing ﬁ  ve 
years ago, she didn’t have a mirror to 
look at during lessons. Learn to feel the moves with your body, not your eyes.
  5 . Don’t worry if the moves seem hard 
at ﬁ  rst. Rechtman assured they will 
come with time. “It’s a great feeling to be able to do a move after months of 
practicing,” she said. “You feel good. 
You feel really sexy, for yourself, not for 
anyone else.”
6. Remember that 
anyone can belly dance. 
There are no prerequi-sites for skill or body type — any and all are 
welcome. “It gives me goose bumps to see a woman who’s not your typical supermodel dancing,” she said. “It makes you shiver because it’s still so beautiful.” BELLY DANCING , from page 8

A.C. Leonard’s high school career could be 
over.
Less than 24 hours after recommitting 
to UF, the Jacksonville University Christian 
High star was suspended by the Florida High 
School Athletic Association for an on-field in-cident that occurred Friday night.
An FHSAA spokesman confirmed Wednes-
day that Leonard, who is rated as the fourth-best tight end in the nation by Rivals.com, was suspended for six weeks for a Level 2 infrac-tion after taking a swing at an opposing player during University Christian’s 24-14 loss to Jacksonville Episcopal High.
The spokesman said this was the second 
incident involving the four-star tight end this season. He didn’t provide details on the first violation, which was classified as a Level 1 infraction, but said Leonard didn’t miss any 
playing time because the suspension was ap-
pealed.
“We certainly respect what the FHSAA 
has decided on,” University Christian coach Heath Nivens said. “I hate it for our football team, and it is what it is. A.C.’s already learned a valuable lesson through this.”
With four regular-season 
games remaining on Uni-versity Christian’s sched-
ule, the team would have 
to advance beyond the sec-ond round of the playoffs for Leonard to be eligible to 
return.
But with the team 0-3 in 
district play and only three 
more district games left, that looks doubtful.
Because Leonard is ineligible, during his suspension he is not permitted on the team’s bench, inside the team box or on the field wear -
ing any portion of the team’s uniform during games, according to an FHSAA bylaw.
Despite the suspension, Nivens said Leon-
ard, who plans to enroll at UF in January, is still on track to graduate in December and join the Gators in the spring.
“We’re certainly going to miss a valuable 
part of our team,” Nivens said. “But if there’s a silver lining in any of this, it’s that A.C. is going to have an opportunity to spend more time on his academic work before becoming 
a Gator.”

For the first time in his 28-year coaching career, Andy 
Jackson will be able to stay home for the regional champion-
ships.
Beginning today, the Gators will host the USTA/ITA 
Southeast Regional Championships, a tournament featur -
ing competitors from 14 schools across Florida and Georgia, including FSU, Georgia, South Florida and Florida Atlantic. “The states of Florida and Georgia are two of the very 
best in the country in terms of men’s tennis,” Jackson said. 
Jackson has been impressed with his team’s performance 
this fall, as four of seven players have earned national-level results. 
The development of second-year players Sekou Bangoura 
Jr., Bob van Overbeek and Nassim Slilam has been a bright spot for the team following the departure of senior Antoine Benneteau in the spring. 
“Nassim, Bob van Overbeek and Sekou Bangoura were three of the best freshmen in the country last year,” Jackson 
said. “This year they need to be three of the best players in 
the country like Antoine was last year.”
Women travel to Georgia: Eight players will travel to 
Athens, Ga., to take part in the four-day ITA Southeast Re-
gional on Friday. 
The tournament will be an opportunity for the team to 
improve on its performance at the ITA All-American, where 
coach Roland Thornqvist said none of the players put to-gether a complete tournament. Gators ready to host regional championshipsLeonard

the O’Connell Center and thousands more on ESPNU, No. 1 Florida (17-1, 10-0 SEC) defeated  No. 21 Tennessee 3-0 (25-20, 25-23, 25-20) to ex-
tend its win streak to 12.
“The match is going to say 
3-0, but it was much closer 
than 3-0,” coach Mary Wise said. 
Outside hitter Kristy 
Jaeckel led a balanced offen-sive attack for the Gators, as the junior logged 12 kills and hit .346. 
As a team, UF had six 
players with at least five kills, 
hitting .318 and holding UT 
(15-4, 7-3 SEC) to just .219. 
After containing Nikki 
Fowler and yielding 19 kills to Kayla Jeter in the teams’ 
first meeting, UF’s defense 
flipped the script Wednes-day. The Gators surrendered 
a match-high 15 kills to 
Fowler while holding Jeter to just seven. 
“We knew to beat Tennes-
see we couldn’t have both of their great hitters be in that 
20-points range,” Wise said. 
“Nikki Fowler is a terrific talent, and she gave us fits as she has for her entire ca-reer.”
The Gators came out and 
took the first set 25-20 despite 
being outhit .333 to .316 and out-blocked 3.5 to zero. 
Florida was able to turn 14 
digs and a number of partial 
blocks into 38 total attacks 
versus Tennessee’s 30, allow-
ing UF to overcome its inef-ficiency.
“Honestly it’s hard to 
imagine, other than I think 
we benefited from a few 
unforced errors and some ball-handling errors early on 
in that first set,” Wise said. 
“The stats say they should have won it.”
In a back-and-forth sec-
ond set that featured 13 ties, 
the Gators returned to their 
usual form, recording three blocks to their opponent’s one. 
That effort was a big rea-
son why they cut Tennes-see’s hitting percentage by .137 from the first to second set. 
After giving up 11 kills on 
.588 hitting to Fowler in the first two sets, UF held the se-nior to just four kills on .154 hitting.
A large part of that change 
was due to the play of junior Kelly Murphy, who only had seven kills after coming in as 
the SEC Offensive Player of 
the Week but still managed a double-double with 17 as-sists and 15 digs.Gators remain undefeated in SEC

Gators fans waiting for the return of 
Chris Rainey can tentatively circle Oct. 
30 on their calendars.
Coach Urban Meyer said the junior 
is eligible to play in Florida’s matchup 
with Georgia next week. Rainey has not 
seen the field since the team’s 38-14 win 
against South Florida on Sept. 11.
Three days after that game, Rainey 
was arrested and charged with a felony for aggravated stalking. 
But the receiver accepted a plea deal 
that reduced the charge to a misdemean-or on Sept. 27, and he started practicing with the Gators again last week.
Meyer said he won’t officially decide 
until next week if Rainey will be back. And even if the receiver does return, 
Meyer does not know how prominent a role 
Rainey will play against 
the Bulldogs, although se-nior center Mike Pouncey expects to see an impact.
“He’s the best player 
on our team and we really need him,” said Pouncey, who has played with Rainey since the two attended Lakeland High. “He’s an exciting player, and as 
long as he keeps his mouth shut and 
keeps doing what he does, we’ll have him (against Georgia).”
When asked to address Florida’s of-
fensive problems, Meyer said the unit’s most pressing issue is its inability to break long runs, hinting at how impor -
tant Rainey could be for the second half of the season.
The Gators feature the Southeastern 
Conference’s 10th-ranked rushing of-fense and have only scored two rushing touchdowns from outside the red zone 
this season, both by running back Jeff 
Demps.
But Demps (sprained left foot) has 
been limited for the past four games, and he has not scored on a long play WR Rainey

Lindsay Thompson never lost confi-
dence. She never complained and never 
lost the will to lead Florida’s attack. 
The junior forward is relishing her re-
cent opportunities. 
A season removed from leading the 
Gators with 10 goals, Thompson struggled to find her rhythm early this year. Despite returning as a veteran on a young No. 12 UF (12-2-2, 6-1-1 Southeastern Conference) team, the striker started just four of the first 14 games and couldn’t find her scoring touch for much of the season.Thompson didn’t register a goal until 
the fifth game, and she’ll get a chance to 
add to her tally at LSU (6-6-4, 3-2-3 SEC) to-night at 8.
But Thompson 
never hung her head or moaned to coaches 
about her diminished 
playing time. As a team 
leader, she demon-strated an optimistic at-
titude by showing up early to practice for extra work. 
“I never tried to get my head down. I 
always tried to stay positive,” she said. “Sometimes you get less lucky, but you just have to keep trying. I never lost confidence in myself.”
Thompson’s perseverance paid off this 
past weekend when she was rewarded 
with her first start in nearly a month. The 
forward responded with a two-goal explo-sion at Tennessee’s expense. 
On Sunday, Thompson was in the start-
ing lineup again, a back-to-back occurrence for the first time since the first two games of the season, and she played 90 minutes on her way to the game-winning assist in overtime. 
“Last weekend was a breakthrough 
weekend for her,” coach Becky Burleigh said. “Hopefully she can continue [her re-Thompson rebounding after slow start

UF wide receiver Chris Rainey will be eligible to play against Georgia on Oct. 30 after missing the last five games 
due to a suspension.
Demps, Gillislee, 
Moody still limited
since his 62-yard run against 
USF.
Rainey moved to slot re-
ceiver before the season, re-cording six catches for 34 yards and a touchdown and carrying the ball four times 
for 16 yards in two games.
But the Gators’ running 
backs have been limited late-ly. Senior Emmanuel Moody 
(quad) and sophomore Mike Gillislee (hamstring) are still recovering from injuries. Last 
week UF had to turn to wide 
receiver Omarius Hines, who gained a team-high 58 yards 
on six carries. 
Rainey ran for 575 yards 
and five scored on 89 carries 
last season.
Meyer would not say if 
Rainey’s role will change in 
light of the other tailbacks’ injuries, but Pouncey thinks 
Rainey could single-handedly 
provide a boost to the Gators’ ailing offense.
When asked if one player 
could truly make a difference, Pouncey responded: “If we brought back Percy Harvin, it would make a big difference, wouldn’t it?” 
Injuries: Demps, Moody 
and Gillislee have all been limited in practice this week.
Wide receiver Andre De-
bose (sprained ankle), de-fensive tackle Jaye Howard (sprained ankle) and line-backer Jelani Jenkins (con-cussion) have not practiced, 
Meyer said.RAINEY,  from page 19
UF forward Thompson has already racked up four goals in October
cent strong play] because she brings a differ -
ent look to our offense than any of our other 
players. 
That distinction Burleigh referred to is Thompson’s muscle and physicality . While Florida has a lot of players who dance with the ball and are, as Thompson says, “balleri-nas out there,” she is a more direct player. The junior uses her strong body and potent shot to beat defenses.  Burleigh said Thompson’s play makes 
Florida’s offense harder to defend.
With four goals in October, Thompson ap-
pears to be peaking just at the right time for the Gators. With her back in the fold, UF em-ploys five viable scoring threats up top.“In order to be a good striker, you have 
to have no conscience and put past failures behind you,” Burleigh said. “You have to be willing to continue shooting and continue plugging away until that breakthrough comes, and I think that’s what she’s done.”
