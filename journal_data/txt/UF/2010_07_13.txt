Most UF students who visit Mi-
ami over summer break spend their 
time on the beach or at the club. 
But not Erin Rush.
Instead, 21-year-old Rush, who 
majors in telecommunications, 
dressed as a yellow baby chick and 
flew 32 feet on a giant frying pan 
with bacon wings into the Atlan-
tic Ocean, in front of  more than 
100,000 spectators.
“Ask my friends,” Rush said. 
“I’m always doing crazy s---.”
Rush, and her four-member, 
rooster-costume-wearing flight crew, represented one of 33 teams who competed in the Red Bull Flug-
tag event at the Bayfront Park in Mi-ami on Saturday.
The five-member team from 
Gainesville called themselves “The 
Frying Egg,” and, although they didn’t win the competition, they came mighty close to winning the fan favorite award.
“There was a point when we 
were 32 votes away,” she said, speaking of the fan-based text vot-ing system. “We sent 
out mass texts to everyone.”
The Frying Egg’s contraption 
was a 5-foot-tall frying pan with wings of bacon spanning 28 feet and built from PVC pipe wrapped 
in plastic pallet wrap and fabric. 
Rush rode in the middle of the pan,

WASHINGTON (AP) — Wenk’s Yellow Hots, Pico de Gallos 
and the unpredictably hot San Juan “Tsiles” chili peppers have 
safely arrived at a “doomsday” vault in the Arctic.
Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Md., says he and other congressmen de-
livered seeds from the pepper varieties on Sunday to a Norwe-gian seed bank on the remote Svalbard archipelago.
Operators say the Svalbard Global Seed Vault has the world’s 
most diverse repository of crop seeds and is a safeguard against war or natural disasters that could wipe out food crops.
The seeds came from a Department of Agriculture collection 
in Colorado. Peanut and melon seeds were also stored away.

Fans rooting for Spain at the Palomino pool hall on Southeast Second Place erupt in celebration of 
Spain’s goal against the Netherlands in the 2010 FIFA World Cup Final.
� THE SOCCER MATCH WAS

The incessant din of the vu-
vuzelas coming through the audi-
torium speakers was muffled by the shouts of Dutch and Spanish sup-porters at the Reitz Union’s World Cup Final viewing Sunday after-noon.
About 550 people watched the 
2010 FIFA World Cup Final at four different locations at the Reitz Union: the auditorium, the Orange 
& Brew, the bowling alley and Taco 
Bell. 
In total, 13 televisions and 
two projector screens showed the match.
Freshman Lyle Chrzaszcz said 
he supported the Netherlands fol-
lowing USA’s knockout round loss.
 He liked the Dutch team’s 25 
consecutive unbeaten games and 
the play of Wesley Sneijder, a Dutch midfielder who plays for Italian club 
team FC Internazionale Milan.
USA’s good showing in the tour-
nament probably inspired so many fans to come to the Reitz Union, 
Chrzaszcz said.
“I’m surprised to see so many 
people in America supporting soc-cer,” Chrzaszcz said. “Ever since 
Landon Donovan’s goal against 
Algeria, everybody’s been excited about soccer.”

You may want to check your bank state-
ments if you bought gas at the Shell and 
Sunoco stations on Newberry Road. 
Until last week, the stations, located at 
6900 W Newberry Road and 6800 W New-berry Road respectively, were home to credit card skimmers. 
Skimmers are electronic identity-theft de-
vices that read and store credit card infor-mation. The information is gleaned from the 
credit card readers on the pumps and stored 
on hard drives.
One such device was found at the Shell 
station on July 6. Two more were found at the Sunoco on July 8.
“Unfortunately, if you use your credit 
cards enough and your debit cards enough, it’s not a matter of if you’ll become a victim of some sort of credit card fraud, but a mat-
ter of when,” said Lt. Steve Maynard, the 
public information officer for the Alachua County Sheriff’s Office.
The skimmers were installed on the in-
side of the faceplates using a key that is available to regulators and inspectors of the gas pumps.The skimmers were fitted with Bluetooth capability, so that perpetrators 
didn’t need to go back to the pumps to re-
trieve the information. Instead, they could remotely download the information using a cell phone or a laptop. 
“It was quite clever,” Maynard said. “It 
definitely took someone with a fair amount 
of knowledge of how electronics are run. 
It also took someone with access to one of those keys.” ID theft devices found

PANAMA CITY  — First lady 
Michelle Obama arrived in the Pan-
handle on Monday to meet with business and tourism leaders and discuss how the Gulf oil spill has 
harmed them.
Obama’s plane landed at the new 
Northwest Florida Beaches Interna-tional Airport in Panama City. The 
airport opened in May just as the number of tourists to the Gulf coast began dropping due to the spill.
Obama told Panama City-area 
leaders that she came to the area to give the region’s tourism industry a boost and to show the world that not all of the Gulf Coast’s beaches were 
coated with oil.
“People are looking for things to 
do with their kids this summer and 
this is a wonderful place to visit,” Obama said.
The business, tourism and po-litical leaders told her that the region was suffering a perception prob-lem because of oil that has washed ashore in heavier amounts along beaches to the west. They said they are feeling the economic ripples of the BP spill in the construction, fish-ing and restaurant industries.
Yonnie Patronis, whose family 
has operated a seafood restaurant in the area since 1953, told Obama that he had to take oysters off his menu — not because oysters are not safe 
— but because all oyster harvesters 
have been hired by BP.First lady visits to boost Fla. tourism

When Stephen N. Zack becomes president 
of the  American Bar Association on Aug. 10, he 
will be the fifth UF law school grad to do so.
Zack, who received his undergraduate de-
gree from UF in 1969, will also be the youngest 
president and first Hispanic-American to hold 
the position.
“Being president of the ABA is a great honor 
for Steve, but it is also a great honor for the law 
school, especially because UF has had more ABA presidents than any other law school in the country in the last four decades,” said Rob-ert Jerry, the dean of UF’s Levin College of Law.
Since 1973, Chesterfield Smith, Reece Smith, 
Martha Barnett and Talbot “Sandy” Alemberte 
have served as presidents for ABA after gradu-
ating from UF’s law school. 
Zack has been a president of the Florida Bar, 
speaker of the house for the ABA and represent-
ed Al Gore during the Florida ballot recount case following the 2000 presidential election, said Kristin Loiacono, manager of presidential communications for the ABA.
Zack said he will still practice law, but the 
time he commits to practicing will decrease. Traditionally, the ABA president has a one-year term limit, he said.
Although becoming the first Hispanic-
American president is a great achievement, Zack said, there are still far too few Hispanics represented.
“The profession should mirror 
the population,” he said.
Minorities are underrepresent-
ed in the legal profession, he said. 
Only Native Americans are represented less than Hispanics, he said. 
Zack credits his success to listening to the 
advice he received the day he passed the bar exam: “Get involved with bar association ac-tivities,” he said. “Not only do the people you meet you develop a strong relationship with and have friends for life, but you develop strong skills too.” Law grad leads national bar

Senior Legacy, a UF-affiliated 
fundraising organization, put a Slip 
‘n’ Slide on the Reitz Union North Lawn from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Thurs-day.
“It’s so hot out; it’s supposed 
to be 98 degrees,” said Bernadette Perez, a Senior Legacy staff mem-ber. “We thought it’d be a fun way to cool down.”
Senior Legacy usually targets 
graduating seniors, trying to get them in a “spirit of giving,” she said. 
For 2010 graduates, Senior Legacy 
asks for a donation of $20.10.
The money is used to support 
student services like the Reitz Union and the Career Resource Center.
Jesse Morgan, an advertising ju-
nior, wasn’t wearing a swimsuit on Thursday because he didn’t know about the water slide, but that 
didn’t stop him taking the ride. 
“It’s not every day you get 
to slide down a Slip ‘n’ Slide at 
school,” he said.Seniors leave legacy for $20.10

a Slip ‘n’ Slide on the Reitz Union North Lawn on Thursday.
on top of a sunny-side-up egg.
Rush said the whole egg idea came from a joke her dad 
made about seven years ago, making the connection that she 
shared initials with everyone’s favorite Chinese side-dish.
“He called me egg roll,” she said, which was shortened 
over the years to simply egg.
Rush got the idea to apply after seeing commercials for 
the event on TV. She got an application from her friend and teammate Mark Snyder, who works as a representative for Red Bull and helped coordinate the Red Bull Chariot Race in 
Gainesville in April.
“We just did it for fun,” Rush said. “I didn’t think we’d 
get chosen at all.”
But fate had more surprises in store for Rush and her 
teammates. After months of preparation, their dreams of 
flugtag fame were nearly crushed once the team got to Mi-
ami. 
Rush said it took about three months and $700 to build 
their craft, which originally included the bottom-half of a 
cracked egg. To their horror, they found the entire thing in pieces when they arrived in South Florida.
“We were pretty disappointed,” she said. “We had to re-
build the whole thing. [The crew was] a good team, and we stuck it through. I was really proud of them.”
After all the time, work and money, it only took about 
90 seconds from the time the team stepped on the platform 
until the flying machine  was on the bottom of the Atlantic. 
But the Flying Egg crew didn’t weep to see it go.

it.”Machine took three

Stand-up comedian Calvin 
Cole does not want to just make 
people laugh. 
He wants to be liked.“People could absolutely love 
your jokes, but when they walk out, they will immediately forget 
you,” said Cole, a UF graduate. 
“You want to make people like you. There’s a deep satisfaction 
in making a room of complete 
strangers like you.”
Cole was named the Funniest 
Student in America at the Just for Laughs comedy festival present-
ed by TBS, where he competed 
against three other college stand-
up comedians. 
He and the rest of the UF com-
edy group – Rudy Mendoza, Tim Keck and Brian Amos – won first 
place at the Rooftop Comedy’s 
National College Comedy Com-
petition in Aspen. 
Cole also won the MVP title at 
the competition, leading him to his chance to grab the Funniest 
Student in America title.  
The MVP title was awarded 
to one member from each of the final four teams at the Rooftop 
Competition – UF, 
Emerson College, Xavier Univer-
sity and Loyola Marymount Uni-
versity. 
During his time at UF he co-
managed weekly stand-up com-edy shows at XS, 1982 and the 
Clarion Inn. He is also the co-
founder of the University Stand-
Up Comedy Club, which recruits 
and helps develop new talent. It all began three years ago 
when he took a class with local 
stand-up comedian J.C. Currais, 
who invited Cole to compete at an amateur stand-up comedy 
show in Gainesville.
Cole’s five-minute routine 
earned him second place. He has 
performed at least once a week ever since.
“He hit the ground running 
and never stopped,” Currais said. 
The fulfillment he gets from 
the audience’s “unmitigated ap-proval” is what convinced him 
to pursue stand-up comedy full-
time in New York City.
“I am ready to work,” he said.

TALLAHASSEE (AP) — Republican Marco Ru-
bio’s campaign said Monday it raised $4.5 million in 
the second quarter this year — the best fundraising quarter ever for any Florida Senate candidate.
Rubio, who is the presumptive nominee after Gov. 
Charlie Crist chose to run as an independent candi-date, has increased his fundraising every quarter since entering the race in May 2009. Rubio raised only $340,000 at the end of the same quarter last year, com-pared to $4.3 million raised by Crist.
Crist, a lifelong Republican who announced at the end of April that he would seek the Senate seat 
without party backing, hasn’t an-nounced his fundraising numbers for the quarter. He has been seeking help from groups that traditionally support Democrats. He had raised more than $10 million through the 
first three months of this year.
Of the two major Democrats in 
the race, Rep. Kendrick Meek an-
nounced he raised more than $1 million in the quarter that ended June 30. Billionaire Jeff Greene is paying for his own campaign. Rubio has best fundraising quarter

Maynard said that the skimmers were planted by a na-
tional criminal organization, and that the United States 
Secret Service has been investigating them for some time. 
After being downloaded from the device, the card 
information is either used to manufacture new cards, or used to purchase items online.
The first of the devices was discovered by someone 
performing routine maintenance at the Shell station. 
The devices at the Sunoco were found by the owners of 
the station, who checked their pumps after hearing about 
what happened at the Shell station.
Sheriff’s deputies have been working 
with the Gainesville Police Department and 
the Alachua Police Department to check all gas pumps within two miles of Interstate 75 
for the devices. No other devices have been found.
Those concerned about safety at the pump should pay 
inside with cash, Maynard said. 
“Cash is king. Cash is the only way you can guarantee 
your safety,” he said. 
Businesses concerned about people installing skim-
mers should routinely check their pumps, particularly behind the faceplates, he said.

ment on the matter. Concerned customers

UF faculty members can now 
go to Haiti without restrictions, 
according to a Monday afternoon memo from UF Provost Joseph 
Glover and Vice President for 
Student Affairs Patricia Telles-Irvin.
After the country suffered a 
7.0-magnitude earthquake Jan. 12, a memo was released Feb. 5 announcing restrictions against 
travel to Haiti.
The original announcement 
said no UF-related trips were al-
lowed without specific approval 
from UF administrative officials, 
but now UF faculty members can visit Haiti as long as they fill out travel forms. 
The memo also advised fac-
ulty to consider warnings against traveling to Haiti. 
Graduate students are al-lowed to visit the country if they 
sign a waiver with two weeks’ 
advance. 
They must also meet seven 
specific requirements, such as the 
possession of “personal maturi-
ty” and medical insurance.
Undergraduate students are 
still not allowed to visit the coun-try in any UF-affiliated capacity. 
Undergrads remain free to vis-

Today’s question: Should Two Rivers School District be able to keep the Gators logo?
208 TOTAL VOTES81% YES19% NOThursday’s question: Should stores be allowed to sell water pipes?Verse Veto
Game shouldn’t feature 
Tebow’s Bible eye-black
Chances are more than a few students are stumbling 
into class after an all-night session of NCAA Football 11, which features Tim Tebow on its cover — sans 
eye-black Bible verse.
There was never a question in our minds whether EA 
Sports, the company that makes the game, would leave out that little bit of white text. They want to sell as many copies of the game as possible, and mass appeal mixes with religion about as well as oil and water.
Tim Tebow’s public persona has very little to do with why 
he made the cover of this video game. It also has little to do with why he won the Heisman Trophy and led us to two na-tional championships. He is a great athlete, and that is why he is being commemorated. Maybe his faith is what gave him 
the drive to perform on the field, but a little bit of face paint 
had nothing to do with it.
We’ll have to wait and see if a verse makes it onto the 
larger-than-life statue of Tebow on campus, but we’re bet-ting — and hoping — it doesn’t. Through the eyes of the uni-versity, Tebow needs to be remembered as a football player, not an evangelist. Hearing people complain about issues like this makes us nostalgic for Timmy’s on-your-face approach to religion, rather than the in-your-face style that’s all the rage nowadays.
Mascot Mishap
When students were 
given the chance to decide on their 
school mascot, they chose the Gators. At least that was the case in Arkansas’ Two Rivers School District 
after a school merger  – and 
UF is not happy about it.
Well-designed and 
well-known logos are fre-quently subject to parodies, 
knock-offs or theft. Given 
the Gators’ success across several sports in the past decade, we can’t say we’re 
surprised that kids in Ar-
kansas are digging for a reason to root for the Or-ange and Blue over their Razorbacks.
Instead of slapping the 
school district on the wrist and pushing them into spending $8,000 to have the 
Gators logo removed from 
its gymnasium floor, UF should have taken it as a compliment and used it as an opportunity to expand 
the Gator Nation.The university could use 
a few more out-of-state stu-
dents to help pay the bills 
— the administration’s nev-
er been coy about admitting that — so why not have them come from Arkansas? 
It seems to us that there’s a 
well of students who would love nothing more than to don some Orange and Blue and watch Gators sports.
And think of the mer-
chandising opportunity. The market here in Florida is saturated, but UF could 
easily sling some of last 
year’s T-shirt stock to kids in Arkansas. Of course, if they let one school slip by, they have to let the rest of 
them get away with it, too, 
but with proper merchan-dising we don’t see how that would be a problem.
If we can get enough 
high school Gators teams out there maybe we can sell enough hats to pay for those Reitz Union renova-
tions. Ways to excel in academics, social life

produce more readily achieved study goals and impres-sive term papers. That being said, majoring in a whimsical and far-fetched topic because it interests you isn’t always 
the best choice for people looking to pay off their mort-
gages in less than an eon. In short, don’t be a doctor just 
because it’s a reliable high-income choice, and don’t major in Eastern Yugoslavian Trade Patterns from 1901 to 1903 
because there’s only one job in the world where that ma-
jor is applicable and it’s already occupied by the professor 
who taught you. Instead, spend your first year taking a 
wide variety of elective classes in different majors and get 
a feel for that balance of interesting and applicable before 
going all-out and committing to one. May God have mer-cy on you if you should choose to change majors and have 
to wait for a walk-in appointment at the College of Liberal 
Arts advising office. 
5) Don’t expect to marry your first college romance, 
and don’t move in with that person.
This lesson may not come until after your first or sec-
ond year, but it speaks for itself. Relationships are great, 
but they must be between two people who can respect the 
other’s need for personal time, and this is especially true in college. If your significant other ever gets the brilliant idea that you two should get an apartment together after you’ve been dating for four months, turn the other way and run. 
Moving in with someone before 
you are ready is a surefire recipe for disaster, and it always leads to that awkward situation after break-ing up. Having to live in the same 
400-square-foot apartment for the 
next five months until your lease 
ends can be even more painful.
6) Join a political organizationDespite what your overly enthusiastic and involved 
roommate may tell you, Student Government is not “the real world.” There is nothing more dangerous than the apathetic citizen, and I fought for years on campus as the College Republicans chairman to educate students about 
the American political environment. Join the College Re-
publicans or College Democrats and understand the is-sues both organizations pursue.
7) Join a fraternity/sororityLast but not least, consider joining the Greek world. 
Reform and heavy university regulation of Greek life have prevented the Animal House stereotype from persisting into modern reality. 
Instead, a Greek organization is a great way to build 
a network of peers and alumni that can be indescribably beneficial to you later in life. But first, for many, you will have to overcome the Hollywood stereotypes of the Greek world. I was of a similarly anti-Greek mindset until I en-countered Delta Upsilon, where I found a house of guys 
who worked together to promote success and live by hon-
orable principles.

letters@alligator.orgLetters to the EditorTUESDAY, JULY 13, 2010 � ALLIGATOR, 7
The professional athlete is no longer just an ath-
lete. They have been labeled as role models, icons, champions and spokespeople, but there’s one thing 
they have never been labeled: businessmen or business-women.
This summer’s free-agent frenzy in the NBA was one 
of the most anticipated off-seasons in the history of pro-
fessional sports. 
LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh, Amar’e 
Stoudemire and Carlos Boozer led the 2010 free-agent 
class of the NBA. 
The NBA, the franchises involved in the sweepstakes 
and the superstar players were getting more sports cov-erage, media attention and fan support in the off-season than the MLB, NASCAR, maybe even the World Cup, 
which are in season. 
So much money was at stake not only for the players, 
but for the franchises, the NBA and the communities of 
Chicago, Cleveland, Miami, New Jersey, New York and 
Los Angeles. 
For the player, multimillion dollar contracts, brand 
awareness, success and family happiness were all part of 
the process. 
Some of these objectives were the same that encom-
passed the thoughts of the Cavaliers’ owners, local busi-nesses and the fans in the community as well. 
But after seeing the behavior from some of the fans in 
Cleveland and reading the text message from the major-
ity owner of the Cleveland Cavaliers, Dan Gilbert, there 
is reasonable proof for me to state that fans and owners have no desire for players to be business savvy away from the court. 
They just want them to be 
nothing other than the stereo-
typical jock.
LeBron’s decision to join the Miami Heat was certainly 
a risky move, but it was the right move for him to make 
personally. 
Why? Because it gives him a great chance to win an 
NBA championship. 
He’s now in a large, diverse market that will create 
more brand growth globally, and he is the only person who has to live with this decision. Cleveland fans are mad 
because the Cavaliers will not win a championship with-
out LeBron, and everyone wants to be part of a winning team. 
Cleveland-area business owners are upset because 
their bars, restaurants and hotels are going to have de-creased profits from prior years. 
Cavaliers’ ownership, especially Gilbert, is most defi-
nitely mad because they just lost their prized investment. Gilbert purchased the team in 2005 for a whopping $375 million. 
The Cavaliers are currently valued at $476 million by 
Forbes.com, but according to some reports the value of 
the team could potentially plummet by as much as $250 
million. 
The letter Gilbert wrote to the fans of Cleveland was 
written from the business standpoint of an investment 
gone bad and with the emotional rage of having lost his 
$100 million slave.
LeBron made the decision to go to Miami based strictly on business.
We’ve heard everyone say LeBron owes the city of 
Cleveland. Truth be told, he doesn’t owe the city any-
thing. 
The Cavaliers organization was fortunate enough to 
get the first pick of the 2003 NBA draft. 
The city prospered financially because of the LeBron 
James effect. 
LeBron’s athletic skills would have brought him mil-
lions of dollars whether he was in Cleveland or another 
city. 
His impact on the city is large financially, but let’s 
gets real: It would be much worse if Wal-Mart closed and moved out of Cleveland. That’s a real impact on people’s lives. 
Athletics is a business, whether it’s the NBA, NFL, 
MLB or the NCAA. 
We as fans should never forget that, especially those 
with a vested interest financially. 
He decided that he wanted to pursue his career with 
his friends, for less money, in a great city with wonderful weather and great attractions. 
I think he made the right decision, but that’s just my 
opinion.
If you had the chance to play or work with some of 
your closest friends while making millions of dollars and you are a 26-year-old single person, what business deci-sion would you make? 
Live and play in Cleveland, or live and play in Mi-
ami?  
Yulander Wells Jr.is a Gainesville resident.SGP doesn’t bring in best artists
It is very sad how Student Government 
Productions runs its business. It brings an 
artist in for such large amounts of money that the people who want to see that artist can’t afford it. 
Or it has the artist play at the UF Band-
shell.
SGP does not understand that it needs 
to bring in artists who people will pay to see, artists who will sell out the Stephen C. O’Connell Center and artists who will in-crease revenue to bring more bands to UF.
The Pixies go on tour in September. They are asking $38,000 to play and are 
selling out shows. They can fill the O’Dome, and SGP is not interested.

� � �UF came down too hard on Ark. school
I am the agriculture teacher at a small 
rural school in Arkansas, and our school 
recently underwent a consolidation in-
volving three schools into one school dis-
trict. 
Bringing three separate schools togeth-
er and keeping everyone happy presented 
many challenges. 
One of the biggest hurdles to get over 
was our sports. 
You’re probably wondering at this point 
what this has to do with your school and why someone from a small, rural school 
in Arkansas is submitting a letter to your paper. 
Well, it’s like this: Each school had to 
give up its mascot. This was not easy, but we told the students that they would be al-lowed to pick the new mascot and school colors themselves.
With much debate, the students finally 
made their decision. 
We were going to be the Two Rivers 
Gators, and yes, our colors were blue and 
orange. 
Finally, there was a decision made that 
helped pull our separate schools together. 
The whole community seemed to come to-gether on this.
The fundraisers began immediately. 
We had to raise a lot of money to buy new uniforms for all of our teams. We had bake sales, car washes, school dances—you 
name it, we tried it. 
With much work, we finally made it. 
The finishing touch was the gator head in 
our school gym.  
We were all very excited until we re-
ceived a letter from your school: violation of mascot copyright.

Organizations don’t oppose ordinance
Although I’m very happy to see the Al-
ligator following up on the drinking ordi-
nance, I’d like to clarify a few confusions. I said that I was going to try to work with the UF College Democrats and members of Stu-dent Government to see if we could get bi-partisan support in opposing the ordinance, but I haven’t gotten the confirmed support yet. I wanted to clear this up because, as of now, these organizations are in no way as-sociated with this opposition.

14, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, JULY 13, 2010
It’s been fairly well-docu-
mented, to say the least, that NBA free agency started July 
1, with many big names on the move – most notably, LeBron James and Chris Bosh to Miami with Dwyane Wade.
A lesser known fact is that July 
1 also marked the beginning of the free-agency period for many of the nation’s sportswriters.
Much like the NBA, there was 
a moratorium in place during the first week of free agency during which media outlets could only talk with writers, but not formally 
offer them contracts.
It was during that time that I 
met with several suitors about 
joining their organization and bringing my journalism skills to 
the table.
Out of respect for the outlets 
courting me the last couple of 
weeks, I’ve remained quiet on the 
subject of my future.
Until now, that is.
I’ve decided to take a page out 
of LeBron’s playbook and will publicly make my decision in this column.
Okay, so it’s not quite like 
LeBron’s decision, since he did it on an hour-long special on na-tional TV special. But this is close. I mean, after all, the name of my 
column is The Tom Green Show.
Like LeBron, the proceeds from 
my announcement in this column 
– in a paper you pay nothing for – will go to a yet-to-be-determined 
charity of my choice.
Before I get to my much-antic-
ipated decision, I’d like to share 
with you all some of what I have 
gone through during this whole 
courting process.
Let me start by saying this has 
been quite an experience for my-self and my representatives.
I appreciate the presentations 
given to me by six different news-papers from across the nation. Each one put on a fantastic pre-
sentation that shows their orga-
nization’s willingness to achieve excellence in the field of sports journalism.I just 
want to let every-
one know 
that this decision w a s n ’ t 
s o l e l y 
based on m o n e y , 
but based on what gives me the best chance to achieve greatness.
It’s been a very tough couple of 
weeks for me to make this choice. I’ve had a lot of people in my ear giving me advice, but at the end of 
the day, this is about what’s best 
for my family and my future.
When it ultimately came down 
to making my choice, I put ev-eryone else’s opinions aside and 
thought long and hard about it, 
going back and forth over where to sign several times, including as recently as Monday afternoon.
And now, for the decision that 
everyone wants to know: This fall, man, this is very tough. This fall, I’m going to take my writing tal-ents to South Beach and join the Miami Herald.
This was a very tough decision 
for me, leaving behind the Inde-pendent Florida Alligator, the paper that decided to give me my first opportunity.
But I feel this is the best oppor-
tunity for me to join forces with some of the best sportswriters available during this free-agent period and build a media dynas-
ty.
It is my intention to join forces 
with the likes of columnists Dan 
LeBatard and alligatorSports 
alumnus Israel Gutierrez to form 
the Miami Herald’s own version of the “Miami Thrice,” or my per-sonal favorite: The Trio Five. 
I will be signing a contract 
worth less than the maximum of-fered to me in order for the paper to bring in other journalists in their prime to round out the rest 
of the staff.
While I will be taking less 
money than what the Alligator 
can offer me, the exact numbers for the deal cannot be disclosed at the moment.
Hopefully, my fans here in 
Gainesville respect my decision and understand that I gave them my all during my time at the Al-ligator. 
I will always remember the 
work I did here, and just know that you guys were lucky to have me.
And most importantly, I hope 
my boss, Anthony Chiang, doesn’t take this personally and bash me in a letter to readers typed in Comic Sans font, because that 
would be both unfortunate and 
something he might regret down the road. 
Now if you’ll excuse me, I 
must catch a private jet to Miami, 
where the city is throwing a wel-
come party for its new free-agent haul.
Editor’s note: Even though UF 
students may feel betrayed, this newspaper would gladly wel-come Tom Green back.Columnist announces free-agency intentions in “700-word special”

TEEING OFF WITH ANTHONY CHIANG INSIDE QUOTABLEUF TRACK AND FIELD
By JESSE SIMONTON
Alligator Writer
 
Gators men’s track and field 
athletes Christian Taylor and 
Gray Horn have both won at such a torrid pace this year, a heat swell would still not be a deter-rent. 
With the heat index reading 
102 degrees this weekend, the pair still picked up victories at the 2010 North American, Cen-tral American and Caribbean Un-der-23 Championships at Ansin Sports Complex in Miramar.
“It was so hot, man,” Horn 
said. “The key to this weekend was just staying hydrated and trying to avoid muscle cramps.”
Horn, the two-time defend-
ing Southeastern Conference de-cathlete champion, captured two 
events and set a personal record 
on his way to winning the overall 
men’s decathlon. 
Horn began the sweltering day 
winning the 110-meter hurdles 
with a time of 14.57. Later, he 
won the men’s pole vault with a 
leap of 4.60 meters, but the multi-
talented sophomore clinched the 
overall victory by placing second 
in the javelin with a personal-re-
cord throw of 52.27 meters. 
“Everything was just real solid 
this weekend,” he said. “Nothing 
spectacular, just consistency all 
around.”
Horn said he was proud of his 
javelin throw because it bested his previous record by three me-
ters.
Taylor, the NCAA Outdoor 
and Indoor men’s triple-jump champion, won both the triple jump and the long jump this weekend. Taylor won the triple jump, his best event, on his fifth 
attempt with a leap of 16.66 me-
ters.Taylor tied his personal best in 
the long jump with a leap of 8.19 meters. The jump also tied the 
second-best long jump in school 
history. 
DEKKERS EARNS
SCHOLARSHIP
In other related Gators track 
and field news, senior thrower 
Evelien Dekkers, the 2010 NCAA 
javelin champion, has been 
awarded a prestigious NCAA postgraduate scholarship. 
Scholarships of $7,500 have 
been given by the NCAA to 29 male and 29 female student-athletes who participated in a spring sport. Dekkers, the three-time defending SEC women’s 
javelin champion, holds a 3.84 
GPA while majoring in food sci-ence and human nutrition. She is also minoring in business admin-
istration and has been named to 
the SEC Academic Honor Roll in each year of her collegiate career.
According to the NCAA, in 
order to be eligible for a post-
graduate scholarship, a student-
athlete must meet certain criteria, including an overall grade-point average of 3.20 (on a 4.0 scale) or 
the equivalent of that GPA. 
The student-athlete must also 
have “performed with distinction 
as a member of the varsity team in the sport in which the student-
athlete was nominated,” accord-
ing to GatorZone.
Those selected by the NCAA 
must have shown a well-rounded 
approach to performance both on 
and off the field that has gained recognition for the student-ath-lete and the school.Taylor, Horn battle elements to earn victories at NACAC

� THE TROJANS WILL NOT BE ELIGI -
BLE FOR A BOWL GAME UNTIL 2012.
By ANTHONY CHIANG
Alligator Staff Writer
achiang@alligator.org
 
After the Trojans hired a new head 
coach and brought in the top 2010 recruit-
ing class, according to Rivals.com, the off-
season took a turn for the worst.
The NCAA issued a two-year probation 
to the Trojans because of benefits running 
back Reggie Bush received while playing 
at USC. 
They will not be eligible for a bowl game and will be left out of the Associated Press’ weekly rankings during that span.
Still, the Trojans are in ours. They come 
in at No. 8 in the alligatorSports’ count-
down of the top 10 college football teams 
going into the 2010 season.
The Trojans will lose 30 scholarships 
during their punishment.
All of this will prove tough for newly 
hired Lane Kiffin, who left Tennessee to become the coach at USC on Jan. 12.
Kiffin was an assistant coach at the 
school when Bush was receiving improper 
benefits in 2005.
But the Trojans will still field a top team 
this season after finishing with their worst record in 10 years.
Kiffin brought in the No. 1 recruiting 
class in the nation despite all the contro-
versy surrounding the school. The class in-
cluded Scout.com’s top two wide receiving prospects in Robert Woods and Kyle Prater.
These additions should 
help sophomore quarter-back Matt Barkley, who led 
the team to a 9-4 record in his first year at the helm. He threw for 2,735 yards and 15 
touchdowns in his freshman season. How-
ever, he also piled up 14 interceptions.
But Barkley lost some of his top weap-ons. Running back Joe McKnight, who led the team with 1,014 rushing yards, and wide receiver Damian Williams, who was first on the squad with 1,010 receiving 
yards, were both taken in the NFL Draft.
Quick freshman running back Dillon 
Baxter and hard-running redshirt senior 
Allen Bradford are expected to split time and fill the void in the backfield. 
Baxter and Bradford could be this year’s 
version of the Bush and LenDale White running back tandem that led the Trojans to the BCS national championship game in 
2005.
The offensive line will feature one of No. 8 USC: Two-year probation looms for Kiffin’s Trojans

� If you don’t think steroid use is down in the MLB, the boredom the Home Run 
Derby caused you should be prime evidence. ... The Orlando Sentinel reported 
that UF committed four secondary NCAA violations because an assistant coach wrote on two recruits’ Facebook walls. To avoid it, they should have just kept it safe and went with a Facebook poke. “(Mike Miller is) my boy, from Day 1. 
Before the NBA. That’s my college 
roommate. Our relationship is a lot 
deeper than just basketball. He’s like 
Dwyane (Wade) is to me, except we’re 
just different colors.”
Udonis Haslem, former UF center

NCAA Football 11 comes out in stores today. Not 
only is this a popular topic amongst college students 
because it provides an excuse for them to avoid 
studying, but former Gators quarterback Tim Tebow is 
on the cover. This alone will increase the video game’s 
sales and popularity around 
the area. Tebow is the sec-ond Gator to appear on the 
cover. NCAA Football 98 fea-tured former Heisman win-

According to the Orlando Sentinel, a rival school 
turned in the Gators football team to the Southeast-
ern Conference last year for four secondary NCAA vio -
lations. A Florida assistant used the Facebook walls of two recruits to post comments on Aug. 5. However, 
the NCAA only allows them to communi-cate through e-mail or even direct mes-
sages on Facebook. As punishment, the assistant coach was banned from writ-ten communication 
with recruits for two 
weeks.

Former Gators basketball players Udonis Haslem 
and Mike Miller signed with the Miami Heat on Mon-
day to reunite for the first time since playing together 
at Florida. They join the much-discussed   trio of Dwyane 
Wade, LeBron James and Chris Bosh in Miami. The two 
former Gators are expected 
to contribute off the bench for the Heat. Both Haslem and Miller were on the 1999-
2000 men’s basketball team 
that advanced to the NCAA 
Tournament championship game.

USC quarterback Matt Barkley, who started as a true freshman, threw for 2,735 yards and 15 touch-
downs last season. He led the team to a 9-4 record in his first year on campus.  
Perry looked upon to an-
chor USC defensive line
the top centers in the nation, se-
nior Kristofer O’Dowd. 
It was also expected to receive 
an upgrade when Seantrel Hen-
derson, the top offensive lineman 
in the class of 2010, committed to 
USC. 
The 6-foot-8-inch offensive 
tackle was released from his let-ter of intent with the Trojans af-
ter requesting it in the wake of the two-year probation. He is expected to become a member of 
the Miami Hurricanes.
Defensively, USC will have 
some big spots to fill. 
The secondary will be full of 
new faces. The Trojans will start two new cornerbacks and two 
new safeties this season. 
Free safety Taylor Mays, who 
was selected in the NFL Draft, is 
the most notable loss on the de-
fensive side of the ball for USC.
With defensive end Everson Griffen taken in the fourth round of the NFL Draft, redshirt sopho-more defensive end Nick Perry will be looked upon to carry the load.
Perry tied Griffen for the team 
lead in sacks with eight last sea-son.
The secondary is the main 
area of concern for Kiffin, who will rely on players to step up and earn those positions.
However, the defense wasn’t 
great last season either. 
It allowed 36 points to Oregon 
State, 47 points to Oregon and 55 points to Stanford. 
The top recruiting class should 
go a long way in filling in these voids, however.
But with the loss of scholar-
ships and the disadvantage of be-ing ineligible for a postseason ap-
pearance, Kiffin is going to have 
a tough time trying to extend USC’s success past the next few seasons.USC , from page 15
