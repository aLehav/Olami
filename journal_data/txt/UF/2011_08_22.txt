  Students will once again be able to catch a break on 
their textbook expenses for one day this fall.
  Student Government is partnering with the UF Book-
store in the Reitz Union to bring back Discount Day, or 
Sales Tax Relief Day.
  Students will be exempt from paying the sales tax on 
textbooks bought in store Aug. 22.
  This will be the third Sales Tax Relief Day in three 
years, and Student Body President Ben Meyers said he re-ally wants to see students take advantage of the discount.
  “We’re really trying to boost it up this year,” he said.   The main goal right now is to make students aware of 
the event.
  Meyers said the discount applies only on Aug. 22 and 
only in-store. While it only applies to textbooks, he said he is working with Reitz Union Business Services and the UF Bookstore to extend the exemption to school supplies. 
  The day would not be possible without the help of the 
two groups, he said.
  “They’ve been extremely helpful and they deﬁ  nitely 
realize what a service it is for students,” Meyers said.

  The Stephen C. O’Connell Center re-
ceived a $900,000 facelift this summer that 
was unveiled to the public Saturday at UF’s Football and Volleyball Fan Day.
  David Lucier, assistant director of the 
O’Connell Center, said the largest  reno-vation was the seating. 
  Motors on the bleachers were wearing 
out, so the ﬁ  rst level of seating was re-moved and replaced with new bleachers.
  Other changes included a handrail en-
circling the lower bowl that was added to comply with safety codes and a fresh coat of paint for the outside of the building.  “I think it’s going to be a huge improve-
ment to the building,” Lucier said. “The fans are going to like it.”
  One such fan is Dillon Harrison, 36, 
who graduated from UF in 1996. Harrison traveled from the Jacksonville area to at-tend the event.
  He said he liked the look of the new 
bleachers in the lower bowl of the build-ing. 
  “Compared to when I was here, it looks 
a lot better,” he said. 
  Work on the O’Connell Center began 
in mid-May and ended in the beginning of July.

hovah’s Witness conference were held  O’Connell Center debuts

  For the the third straight year, the cost 
of tuition  for UF students is increasing 
by 15 percent this fall.
  The increase was approved by the UF 
Board of Trustees and the Board of Gov-ernors, the state university system’s gov-erning body, in June.
  The measure will raise $26 million in 
revenue for UF. According to ofﬁ  cials, the revenue will help keep the quality of education high for a university that has faced budget cuts in four of the past ﬁ  ve years.
  State legislators approved an 8-per-
cent increase in tuition in the spring. Each state university has the power to raise tuition another 7 percent, bringing the total increase to 15 percent.
  At the June Trustees meeting, UF President Bernie Machen also addressed a $9-million shortfall in need-based ﬁ  -nancial aid — an issue Student Body President Ben Meyers wanted resolved before supporting the tuition increase.  
  In addition to the tuition increase, the 
state is now requiring additional documenta-tion before dispersing Bright Futures awards.
  All students eli-
gible for the Bright Futures  Scholarship 
funds must complete the Free Application 
for Federal Student Aid, known as the FAFSA, before aid is dispersed.
  The state is requiring the paperwork 
to collect data on the population of stu-dents who received the scholarships and the students’ families. Tuition raised 15 percent 
as state budget cuts loom

UF took a dive in rankings that will simultaneously please 
administrators and leave some students dismayed as the 
university placed at No. 9 on the Princeton Review’s Annual College Ranking list of the nation’s top 20 party schools.  
Assistant Vice President of Student Affairs and Dean 
of Students Jen Day Shaw said she took the drop as good news. 
“We are proud of our students for a whole bunch of 
things: their academics, their community services,” she said. “We get frustrated when we are listed for something like par -
tying. There are too many great things that you all do that don’t get recognized.” 
Five years ago, UF President Bernie Machen instituted the 
UF Community Alcohol Coalition, and since then DUI rates, alcohol related conduct violations and transports to the hos-pital for alcohol have gone down.
In other rankings, UF took the No. 1 spot in the nation’s 
top 20 jock schools, as well as ranking No. 1 for career ser -
vices. 
Heather White, interim director of UF’s Career Resource 
Center, said she believes the recognition is a direct reflection of the center’s outstanding staff. For three consecutive years the review has ranked UF’s CRC among the top five in the nation. 
“Our staff is very student-centered and dedicated to help-
ing students in whatever field they’re in,” she said. “We couldn’t be happier that the students feel the way they do, and we hope to continue our services.”UF slips in national party school rankings August 31, 1966: UF Director of Athletics Ray 
Graves reaches an agreement with Student Body leaders to apportion 18,000 seats in the stadium’s east stands for students. For the first time, an en-tire sideline is occupied by students.
August 26, 1985: UF administration requires 
fraternities to hire UF police officers to patrol 
their parties. At $15.50 an hour, these guards cost more than twice as much as private secu-rity guards. The following weekend, UF-man-dated guards are only at 15 of the 25 fraternity parties because there aren’t enough officers to go around.
August 27, 1990: The UF Division of Hous-
ing sets an opening date for new dormitories near Flavet Field. They were not yet named but were under consideration to be called Flavet Village. The new suite-style dormitories are set to feature card-access doors and a convenience store in the facility. Those dormitories are now known as Keys Complex. They do not have card-access doors, and there is no convenience store.
August 23, 1993: Smoking is banned in UF 
dormitories. However, smoking is still allowed in faculty offices at discretion. 
August 25, 1994: Barnett Bank collaborates 
with UF ID Services to make the UF All-in-One ID Card (later the Gator 1 Card) ATM ca-pable. The bank requires a minimum balance of $1,500 on its cards and students have to pay a $3.75-a-month fee if their balances fall below that amount.

In the spring Student Government 
elections, students were promised cam-
pus-wide free printing, but they may get a lot more than that.
Student Body President Ben Meyers 
created the Free Printing Task Force in May to determine the areas of campus where access to computers and print-ing is most needed. The results showed that most UF colleges don’t have the fa-cilities available to house computer labs for printing.
To solve this problem, Meyers hopes 
to have new labs built with upgraded features like Apple computers and pro-jection screens, as well as free printing.“This will make our campus and 
student resources jump ahead five years,” Meyers said.
In the first phase, probable locations 
for new labs include the McCarty build-ings, the law school, the journalism col-lege and the Communicore Building.
Construction could begin sometime 
this fall and is scheduled to be complet-ed by the end of the spring semester, pending approval by the Activity and Service Fee Committee.
The project would cost about 
$300,000 — money obtained from last year’s Activity and Service Fees, which saw a 15-percent increase.
However, some groups have ques-
tioned the sustainability of these labs.
The task force has been working with the Office of Sustainability and Gators for a Sustainable Campus to determine if unlimited printing is a re-sponsible option.
Each student currently has a 300-
page printing quota per semester. 
Meyers said the task force is now 
considering options like allocating printing based on each student’s sched-ule.
Under this model, each professor 
would decide how many pages his or her students would be allotted for the duration of the semester.
“This has become a movement,” 
Meyers said. “It’s not going to be done by the end of my term, but we want to start the process now.”

After last year’s lack of a mu-
sical act, Gator Growl will be 
bringing in The Goo Goo Dolls to rock the crowd at this year’s homecoming celebration.
The Goo Goo Dolls, who will 
be paid $110,000 to perform, be-came the top choice, beating out Maroon 5, Kings of Leon and Bruno Mars.
“If we are going to keep Gator 
Growl affordable to show up to, we just don’t have the budget to get some of these major bands,” said Aaron Heger, director of Gator Growl. “But I would say, compared to past years, we made a much bigger effort to really go after those really big name bands if it was feasible.”
He said according to the stu-
dent and alumni surveys, people wanted to see a rock band over a hip-hop artist.
The Goo Goo Dolls were a top-
five choice on the student survey and a top-three choice on the alumni survey.
“The best part about The Goo 
Goo Dolls is that they appeal to students,” Heger said. “They ap-peal to the younger alumni that grew up listening to them, and they are the type of band, wheth-er you are a younger kid or older alumni, you can listen to this mu-sic and enjoy it.”
No comedian has been an-
nounced as of yet. 
Options include Seth Meyers, 
Jimmy Fallon and one to three others.
After a two-year drought, this 
year’s show will also feature a fireworks display. 
The last time Gator Growl had 
a fireworks display was in 2008, when the Steve Miller Band per -
formed. 
“It’s the students’ show, The 
Gator Nation’s show, and we are trying to give them what they are asking for,” he said.
The fireworks were originally 
taken away from Gator Growl be-cause with the new multi-million-dollar video boards, “no parties felt comfortable with a fireworks presentation,”  Heger said.
The show will be held Nov. 4 
at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium and will start at 7 p.m. 
Student tickets will cost $15 
and general admission tickets will cost $25, with both ticket prices increasing by $5 the week of the show.4, ALLIGATOR §  MONDAY, AUGUST 22, 2011

Election reform has turned from a Student Government plat-
form point to a reality . 
The Senate unanimously voted this summer to approve a bill 
that will do away with paper ballots and move to a computer-
based voting system.
Students would still have to go to an on-campus polling loca-
tion, but instead of receiving a paper ballot, they would swipe their Gator 1 Cards and be ushered to a secure booth with a computer to cast votes.
The system is expected to be ready by this semester’s SG elec-
tion.
The legislation, written by Senate President Micah Lewis, was 
widely supported and endorsed. Senate Minority Leader Gillian Leytham was the one to motion for unanimous approval. 
“It was a wonderful moment,” Lewis said.The system was tried once before in 2005, Lewis said. However, 
poorly trained poll workers caused problems with the election, prompting a return to paper and pens.
This time, he said, SG intends to ensure that poll workers know 
the system, and the technology has improved drastically since.
Treasurer T.J. Villamil said SG expects to save $25,000 by imple-
menting the new system. He will propose Thursday to decrease the election budget from $50,000 to $25,000, he said, since money spent on paper and staff will decrease.
Unite Senator Severin Walstad, who worked closely with Lewis 
on the financial aspects of the bill, said he estimates the savings to be $32,000 as opposed to $25,000.
However, Walstad said, first-year software upgrades would 
cost between $16,000 and $22,000.
The bill comes after a spring 2011 election that was marred by 
controversy. Three students, including two ex-senators, came for -
ward claiming to have voted twice. Instead of voting for a candi-date, they wrote in the name of a historical figure.
Lewis said he wouldn’t condone the action, but he said it did 
alert him to weaknesses in the system.
Students will now be able to cast votes at any polling location 
on campus.
Under previous rules, any kind of electronic voting was illegal. 
The new rules will still disallow online voting, a system used for SG elections at Santa Fe College.SG elections moved 
to computer stations MONDAY, AUGUST 22, 2011 § ALLIGATOR, 5

Today’s question: Do you like the Alligator’s new look? 
115 TOTAL VOTES72% YES
28% NOLast week’s question: Are you ready?
   So much about today is new.
  It’s a new semester. We have new students. We 
have a new head football coach.
  Welcome back to Gainesville. Welcome back to school. 
  Welcome to a new-look Alligator.  If you haven’t already noticed, the Alligator you’ll ﬁ  nd 
in our orange racks looks a little bit different.
  We decided to get a makeover for the ﬁ  rst time in al-
most 10 years. It’s been a long time coming — about nine months — and our staff is extremely proud of our ﬁ  nished product. Needless to say, this is our baby.
  We wanted to, as always, keep the readers in mind as 
we set about this makeover. We wanted to please your eyes and draw you into our stories. We hope what you see before you does the job.
  Working on this massive edition and seeing it placed 
on the page with the design changes was as exciting a mo-ment as any of us have had, but we realized that it wasn’t just about being aesthetically pleased.
  This is signaling something more.   As student journalists, we spend inordinate amounts 
of time studying not only the mechanics of gathering the news and serving it you, but also the preferences of you, the consumer, when it comes to ﬁ  nding the news.
  In this age where physical newspapers are seemingly 
becoming more and more archaic, we know we have to make adjustments. It’s not just about the ink on your ﬁ  n-gers anymore; it’s also about the keyboard and screen you now rely on for news.
  Keep an eye out this semester for a new focus on our 
online presentation. We plan on engaging readers like we never have before, whether it be through our Facebook page or through our tweets. It’s clear that our audience is moving with the times. 
  We don’t plan on getting left behind.  That’s not to say that we are going to shortchange our 
print edition. This redesign gives us a chance to stretch our legs in a few ways. On some pages we have more space, and on others, we sacriﬁ  ced some space to improve  visual elements. There’s a more uni-formed style across sections.
  To go along with our re-
focused mission to improve our online presence, we will advertise our website more prominently (note the URL directly underneath the logo). On many occasions, we will be directing readers to  www.alligator.org or to our social media sites to ﬁ  nd out more 
about the stories we report. 
  We want you to know that we feel the tremendous 
weight of the responsibility we have. We are your student newspaper, and we will strive to serve you and provide you with the best news you can get.
  If you ever have any concerns about your community, 
whether it be on campus or in the City of Gainesville, let us know. We want to make sure we’re reporting on the is-sues that matter most to you.
  One quick turn to page two and you’ll ﬁ  nd all of our 
names and emails on the masthead. Don’t hesitate to drop us a line when you have something to say.
  And if you think you can contribute to the Alligator by 
writing for us, stay tuned.
  In the coming days, we’ll announce the date of our 
open house where we’ll welcome anyone crazy enough to want to get involved in our daily grind.
  We’ll be here with big smiles, ready to accept resumes, 
writing samples and hugs.  
  And, of course, we’ll have pizza.  Elizabeth Behrman is a journalism senior and editor-in-
chief of the Alligator. Josh Isom is a journalism senior and managing editor / online. Joey Flechas is a journalism senior and managing editor / print.  Alligator debuts new look, new focus    If there is one thing we, as a nation, need to start picking 
on, it’s homeless shelters. 
If we don’t get these so-called “charities” under con-
trol, we will be facing a ﬁ  asco that Enron execs would call too risky. 
Google it, freshmen.   To the pleasure of many activists on campus and around 
Gainesville, the city voted Thursday to  end the 130 meal-limit placed on all soup kitchens in the area. 
This long-standing issue ﬁ  nally  seems to have reached 
a conclusion we can support.
  Now, soup kitchens in Gainesville will be given a three-
hour window to serve as many people as they can reason-ably ﬁ  t into their space. 
  Although the limit had been on the books for a while, 
the city started enforcing it in 2009 when local developers began to complain that the St. Francis House, a shelter and soup kitchen on South Main Street, was serving more than 130 people a day. 
  Well, how dare they?  Though Gainesville’s homeless population is signiﬁ  -
cant, the homeless aren’t known for being violent. 
Supporters of the limit also argue that the population 
creates an eye sore and might be unattractive to their pa-trons. 
  The St. Francis House legally obtained its space and 
should be able to use it as it sees ﬁ  t. 
Local residents and businesses should not be using the 
government to force nonproﬁ  ts to behave in ways that make themselves more comfortable. 
  The St. Francis House, like other soup kitchens in the 
area, does not receive funding from local governments. Nonproﬁ  ts should not be restricted by many rules and regulations, especially when their mission is anything but malevolent.
  While this may not have been part of the debate, one 
has to wonder why governments require  places like soup kitchens to meet so many licensing requirements just to open their doors.  
Surely someone who goes through the trouble of pur-
chasing a space and cooking hundreds of meals a day to feed the homeless isn’t looking to cause any trouble. Their whole goal is to help people.   
At its most fundamental level, the purpose of govern-
ment is to protect us. 
Who is really protected by these burdensome steps re-
quired of philanthropists and charities?    Meal limit ﬁ  nally 
served correctly 
City does right thing

Welcome to Gainesville, home 
of the University of Florida and Santa Fe College at the 
heart of The Gator Nation. 
We are excited to welcome our ap-
proximately 60,000 students who bring 
so much vitality to the Gainesville community.
I wish to extend our community’s 
warmest greetings and encourage you 
to actively pursue your diverse inter -
ests and dreams over the course of the year.
Gainesville is certainly the place to 
make things happen. 
Gainesville is home to a plethora of 
opportunities, resources and endless entertainment. 
Of course UF and SFC offer many 
exciting athletic events, but Gainesville also has many other opportunities for enjoyment.
From spending time at our excep-
tionally beautiful lakes, streams and trails to heading downtown for our art festivals or annual fairs, there is always something to do.
To our newest members of the 
Gainesville community and The Gator Nation: Being a Gator will change your life. 
I first came to UF in 1982 to receive 
my master’s degree in zoology, and I immediately fell in love with the city’s pulse and outstanding rela-tionship with the university. 
Becoming a 
member of The Gator Nation and the Gainesville community was so exceptional that I stayed and 
was elected mayor of the city 28 years later. 
The college years are transforma-
tional, and I truly wish you the best of luck embarking on your 2011-12 journey. 
Ahead of you will find great sports, 
inspirational teachers and colleagues, and the ability to accomplish anything you put your mind to. 
I can only hope that Gainesville 
and The Gator Nation will impact you the same way it impacted me. 
My door is always open at City 
Hall, but also make sure to visit the city’s website at www.cityofgaines-ville.org for updates or events in your area.
I wish you a productive year in all 
your endeavors. 
As always, go Gators!Craig Lowe is the mayor of

Speaking OutOn behalf of the UF Student Body, 
welcome to The Gator Nation! 
This is the beginning of the 
greatest years of your life, and we are here to guide you as you make the transition to college life.
Over the course of your studies here, 
you will learn from some of the greatest faculty in the world — international lead-ers in their fields, award-winning academ-ics and dedicated mentors. 
Work hard to be academically success-
ful, not only for the grades you will earn but for the knowledge gained in order to earn those grades.
My challenge for you today is to learn 
as much from the students around you as you do from your classes. 
In a Student Body more than 50,000 
strong, each student brings with him or her a set of experiences and a unique back-ground.
Some of you may be in a long line of 
family members to attend this university; others of you may be the first in your fami-lies to attend college. 
Your achievements in your life so far 
have brought you among our state’s elite here at UF.
I encourage you to find your place on 
this campus. Whether you 
join a fraternity or sorority, Student Government, a cul-tural organization, a church, a synagogue or any other group on this campus, the most important thing to remember 
is to pursue your passion. 
Commit yourself to finding yourself. 
Seek to be not only a member, but a lead-er. 
In all of this, I encourage you to main-
tain a positive attitude. 
You will face defeats, and they will 
teach you more than your victories. 
But don’t go into anything expecting to 
be defeated.Your experience here will be unique and very fulfilling. 
I am excited for the opportunity to get 
to know the Class of 2015 and be a witness to all that you will achieve. 
Always remember that your Student 
Government leaders are here to answer any questions you may have along the way.

A sign outside the Broward Pool reads that the pool will reopen on Monday, Aug. 
22, for the fall semester. Architects have created designs for the remodel of the Broward-area pool, which include improvements such as a lazy river.

The UF campus is now only a tap 
away.
University Relations released its campus 
website Wednesday for iPhones, Androids 
and other Internet-friendly phones.
The site, m.ufl.edu, includes features 
such as a campus map, a bus tracking sys-tem and a university calendar. Students can also access E-Learning and view their holds and schedule through ISIS.
“This is what students expect and 
need,” said Steve Orlando, UF spokes-man.
With the start of the fall semester, the 
site may prove to be a valuable resource. 
Orlando said students expect to be able 
to use phones to access important infor -
mation instead of carrying around maps and bus route guides.
“The demand is going to move over to 
what you get with this,” he said.About 10 people, most of whom were 
from UF Information Technology, devel-oped the site by using university-wide input.
Bruce Floyd, UF Relations’ social media 
specialist, helped design the site’s layout.
Floyd said the main goal was to create a 
website students could use on the go.The setup of the mobile site, he said, is 
more helpful to students than the standard UF website because the latter is more for people who are looking to apply to UF. The mobile site is for students who are try-ing to get to class on time.
The site has a link at the bottom of the 
page to a feedback form where people can give suggestions for more features they’d like to see.
“We did this to try and help the stu-
dents,” Floyd said. “We’re going to con-stantly iterate and update and make it better.”University develops smartphone app for student resourcesMINA RADMAN

UF students seeking a 
typical Gainesville pool par -
ty may not have to look fur -
ther than their own backyard 
in the near future, though it could come at a cost.
University officials, orga-
nizations and architecture firm RDG Planning and De-sign have conducted a series of workshops over the last few months to construct a master plan for the remod-eling of the Broward-area pool.
Plans include an elevated 
leisure pool with a lazy river, a drop slide, waterfalls and a simulated surfing attraction.
“We think it would be 
a place where UF students would be able to come to-gether and relax and get in-volved,” said David Bowles, director of UF RecSports. 
According to Jonathan 
Martin, the landscape archi-tect on the project, the pool area would offer experienc-es similar to those found at apartment complexes around town. 
Inter-Residence Hall As-
sociation president Severin Walstad, who originally pro-posed the idea for the new pool, said in a June Student Senate meeting that he hopes to use already-existing funds for the project, rather than in-crease student fees.
Walstad said most of the 
pools are used as fitness pools.
A survey sent to students 
over the summer received more than 2,400 responses, and about 80 percent of those responses favored the idea of such a pool.
In July, Martin and his associates met with officials from RecSports, IRHA, IFC and the Panhellenic Council to review the survey results and discuss the project. 
They are still in the logis-
tics phase of the design.There is no estimated cost for the construction, and the univer -
sity hasn’t received any new funding. 
“It’s all up in the air right 
now,” Bowles said. “There are a number of ways for money to build up for something like this. If it has to involve student fees, students will be involved in the decision.”
UF environmental science 
sophomore Candace Spencer likes the idea of such a pool but has concerns about the expenses.
“I appreciate the effort 
they are putting into making the pool nicer for residents,” Spencer said. “I wonder, though, if the money isn’t better used somewhere else.”

For at least one year, UF stu-
dents’ nighttime transportation 
options are expanding as UF enters a one-year contract with GOTCHA Ride, an electric-car taxi service that has operated in Gainesville since fall 2010.
The university will give the 
company $75,000 out of already-existing funds paid through the transportation access fee, mon-ey that also funds students’ free RTS rides. “It’s helping them help stu-
dents receive the benefits of their service,” said Scott Fox, the director of UF’s Transporta-tion and Parking Services.
The “Rides,” as GOTCHA 
likes to refer to its electric-pow-ered vehicles, will take students from campus to the downtown district and densely student-populated areas. GOTCHA does not charge for its rides, though it is customary to tip the driver. 
Both UF and GOTCHA Ride 
are still working on the details of the arrangement, and the uni-versity will soon be developing a plan to market the program to students.UF, GOTCHA Ride team

UF and 28 other research universities across the U.S. 
have promised access to an ultra high-speed Internet so fast that one could download a full-length, high-defini-tion movie within seconds.
These universities are all part of Gig.U: The Univer -
sity Community Next Generation Innovation Project.  
“Our goal is to bring in the kinds of businesses that would need high-speed Internet,” said UF spokesman Steve Or -lando.
Although Gig.U introduced the program in July, it has 
not yet set a time frame for the new network’s implemen-tation. 
Students on campus already have access to ultra high-
speed Internet, so the effort will be focused on moving this infrastructure to off-campus locations.
However, Innovation Hub and Gainesville’s medical 
and research community would all benefit from a faster Internet connection, Orlando said. A faster connection could be useful at Shands at UF, which just switched to electronic medical records about a month ago.
This characteristic could act as a huge incentive for 
additional researchers and entrepreneurs to move to Gainesville.
The university contributed $9,000 to the development 
of the project, but the improved connection will be of no additional cost to students or the university.
Gig.U is in the process of developing the request for 
proposals from potential Internet providers such as Cox Communications and Verizon.

it’s definitely in the works.”UF joins effort to bring ultra high-speed Internet to city

The daily life of UF bats will 
soon be available for all to see.  
The bats living in the bat 
house and new bat barn will be getting their own live In-ternet feeds, which will be hosted on a UF website. 
The information in the ki-
osks at the nocturnal dwell-ers’ abode will be updated so the public will have a bet-ter idea of the lives of these bats.
“We want to make it an ac-
tive and really useful site, not only for our local interests but for people who are do-ing bat research worldwide,” said Beverly Sensbach, asso-ciate director at the Florida Museum of Natural History. “That is one of the nice things about having it available on the Web: Anybody can link in and have a look at it if they are interested in bat research or just want to see.”
The bat house was built in 
1991 to help relieve the bat infestation at Percy Beard Track.
Currently there are three 
cameras installed in or around the bat house and bat barn, she said.
The cameras are high defi-
nition, shift automatically from color to infrared and are weatherproof. Normally cameras can 
function at 105 degrees Fahr -
enheit, but the cameras need-ed for the bat house and barn have to operate under the ex-treme conditions where bats live and must withstand 122 degrees Fahrenheit, said War -
ren Brown, systems adminis-trator lead at the Florida Mu-seum of Natural History.
The website’s main use 
will be “as a resource for re-search,” said Bill Paine, infor -
mation technology director at the Florida Museum of Natu-ral History. 
Paine said the website will act as an informative virtual exhibit of the bats.
While the cameras are cur -
rently operational, officials are still working on a way to keep the lens consistently clean.
Paul Ramey, assistant di-
rector of marketing and pub-lic relations for the Florida Museum of Natural History, said this and other technical issues have to be addressed before the launching of the website.
He said officials hope to 
have the site up and running by about June 2012. MONDAY, AUGUST 22, 2011 § ALLIGATOR, 11

If you’ve ever hailed a taxi in 
Gainesville, there’s a chance you 
were overcharged.
According to student complaints 
dating back as early as 2009, some cab drivers took advantage of stu-dents by charging rates of $20-plus per person to travel less than two miles.
As of Aug. 1, Gainesville taxi 
companies were required by the city to display the newly drafted Taxi Service Bill of Rights in all cabs.
The bill outlines the rights of 
both the driver and the passenger, City Commissioner Jeanna Mast-rodicasa said.
It also authorizes drivers to 
charge flat rates,  a one-size-fits-all standard pricing scale formerly reserved for special events such as Gator football games, or run the meter. 
The passenger now has a right 
— and the responsibility — to know what the fare will be before he or she gets in.
Mastrodicasa said the deci-
sion of which rate to charge is ul-timately up to the passenger, and students should negotiate the price before they get in.
Flat rates may offer a cheaper 
alternative in some instances, said Ed Ricci, owner of AAA Taxi. 
He said sometimes flat rates for 
traveling from midtown to down-town would save students a buck or two compared with the meter price.
But after an undercover sting 
operation in December, which caught 11 of 19 drivers not running a meter and resulted in a landslide of allegations and arguments, Ricci said he stopped charging a flat rate, even though it is now an accepted practice. 
“I’m out here to stay in business, 
not to create a problem for the stu-dents or the police,” he said.
When it comes to a safe ride for 
students, the best deal for students depends on how far the trip is.
Jumping in a cab will cost you 
up to $3.50 just to sit inside the vehicle and tack on more charges for idle time, price increases for as little as every one-tenth mile and additional fees per person.
There are other options, though, 
such as using UF’s 
Student Nighttime Auxiliary Patrol, RTS’ Later Gator, or ZIPcarts — an environmentally friendly electric-cart service which charges only $3 
per person or $10 for five people to travel anywhere within its perim-eter.
According to a city commission 
document that details taxi rates, Unimet Taxicab Company charges a minimum fare of $10, regardless of the distance traveled.  
Student Body President Ben 
Meyers said a lack of transparency was a major problem, and some cab drivers are “shady,” adding on extra fees and taking advantage of students. 
He said the new ordinance is a 
positive development, and the bill of rights is an important step to re-solving the issue. 
Mastrodicasa said the new ordi-
nance is more fair and transparent for students.
“I don’t think it’s perfect, but 
it’s the best we can do,” she said.Commission moves to

This semester, students flocking to 
the Southwest Recreation Center will 
be greeted by more space and new equipment.
During the break between Summer 
A and Summer B, the facility’s weight room underwent a series of renova-tions, and last Wednesday, students were able to use the completed space for the first time. Additions include new equipment, 
Infinity flooring, large fans and new water fountains.
The renovations cost about $700,000. 
The money came from leftover funds when Southwest Rec was expanded last fall. Jessica Gates, marketing coor -
dinator for RecSports, said the weight room now has a modern look and feel, similar to the rest of the gym.
“We wanted [the gym] to look seam-
less,” Gates said.
The new equipment includes Iron 
Grip dumbbells, cable-cross cables, Iron Grip urethane plates and two Olympic lifting platforms, according to the UF Department of Recreational Sports website. While there are lifting platforms available in the athletic de-partment for athletes, the ones in the weight room are the only ones on cam-pus that all students can use.
“Students that have already gradu-
ated are saying how excited they are about the changes and wish they hadn’t graduated so they could use [the room],” Gates said.
Because the lighting in the weight 
room has improved, the RecSports staff was able to make more space for popu-lar equipment. The dumbbells are now on the opposite side of the room, and there are more squat racks available.
“The arrangement of the machines 
makes my workout quicker and smoother, and I have a perfect view of all the hot guys lifting weights,” said Deidre Cheeves, a UF aerospace engi-neering sophomore. “I have a feeling a lot more girls will be using this weight room.”
UF nursing junior Daniella Salazar 
agreed.
“[The weight room] is awesome, 
and I’m excited to continue using it throughout the year,” Salazar said.12, ALLIGATOR §  MONDAY, AUGUST 22, 2011

Students can say goodbye to standing in the rain 
and heat while waiting for bicycle repairs.
Student Government’s free bike repair service will  
soon move from the north side of the Constans Theatre 
to the Outfitter in the Reitz Union.
Nancy Chrystal-Green, who has been an adviser to 
SG for three years, said the relocation gives the bike re-pair shop more prominence and a more efficient work-space. 
Since many bike parts needed for a repair are sold at 
the Outfitter, moving the repair shop into the Outfitter will save students a trip.
“We are hoping to streamline the experience for stu-
dents,” Chrystal-Green said.
Chrystal-Green said that to accommodate the bike 
shop, the Outfitter will be expanded by about one-third and will get a new floor and gliding doors that allow bikes to move in and out of the space more easily . 
Renovations to the Outfitter will begin in September, 
and the bike repair shop will move into its new indoor space between Thanksgiving and winter break.Free bike repair

Renovation fees were covered by the O’Connell Cen-

No serious complications arose during the renova-

Lucier said more changes could be in store for the 
center in the near future, such as replacing more seats, lighting systems, air conditioning units and flooring. 
However, he said, those renovations fall under regu-

After more than a year of activist outcry and some attempts 
at compromise, the Gainesville City Commission unanimously 
eliminated a much-debated soup kitchen restriction Thursday.
The commission got rid of the permit stipulation that soup 
kitchens and shelters in the city could only feed 130 people per day, which had been an emotionally charged issue.
IThe number limit, which excluded Christmas, Thanksgiving 
and a day of the shelter’s choice, will be replaced by a time limit of three continuous hours a day between 8:30 a.m. and 7 p.m. 
City shelters could start operating under the new rule as early 
as October .The meal limit has been in place for city soup kitchens since 
the 1990s. It started at 75 meals and was increased to 130 in 2004.
However, it was largely ignored until about a year ago, when 
some downtown business owners called upon the commission to enforce the rule because homeless people were gathering around their stores, which are near St. Francis House, a soup kitchen and shelter.
Some downtown homeowners were also adamant about 
keeping the limit because they said more homeless people will gather near their homes when the limit is lifted.
Activists counter that closing the door on hungry people is in-
humane, especially since there is enough food to feed more than 130 mouths.
At least 31 downtown businesses agreed, signing a petition 
with the Coalition to End the Meal Limit NOW. At least 736 peo-ple also signed the paper petition and 15,391 people signed the online petition. Commission does away with meal limit

Student Nighttime Auxiliary Patrol 
became a little more high-tech on July 
20.  
The upgrade included an automated 
answering system, a Web-based request system and a tablet PC installed in every van that includes a GPS. The tablet also allows calls to be dispatched via touch screen instead of a radio like before.
According to Officer Gregory Cas-
tronover, the SNAP coordinator in the Community Service Division of the Uni-versity Police, the new system has de-creased wait times and increased rider-ship because all request are put into the system.
“If 500 people called, all 500 calls could be answered,” he said.
Before, he said, if a lot of people 
called, they might have to be put on hold due to lack of staff.  The new system al-lows 100 percent of phone calls to be put into the system.

ida geared toward aiding people with eating disorders.
People between 18 and 22 years 
old are prime candidates for eat-ing disorders, said Kevin Wandler, chief of the center.
The center will have three lev-
els of care: hospital care for severe patients at Shands Vista, partial hospital care where patients go to apartments, and individual treat-ment from dieticians and psychia-trists for about 10 hours a week, Wandler said.
“[Wandler] is among the top 
psychiatrists in clinical experience and positive outcomes treating patients with severe eating disor -
ders,” said Mark Gold, chairman of UF department of psychiatry.
The center is scheduled to open 
in early September and will serve the UF community by treating stu-dents, faculty and children of fac-ulty. 
Prices for treatment have not yet 
been established.
Wandler said there is a 10-to-1 
ratio of women to men who have eating disorders, and more than 10 percent of college females have eat-ing disorders or disordered eating.

A new campus initiative is designed to give 
students a shoulder to lean on this fall.
The U Matter, We Care program, coordinat-
ed by Jen Day Shaw, dean of students, aims to 
help students recognize others in distress and give them support.
Day Shaw said similar programs have prov-
en successful, and starting one at UF will help students build support systems.
The College of Journalism and Communica-
tions coined the program’s slogan: “50,000 stu-dents and not one to spare.”
For its size, Day Shaw said, UF is incredibly 
caring, but the program will go a step further so that no one is left out. 
“Nationally and at UF, we’re seeing a rise 
in students, faculty and staff who are dealing with mental health issues,” she said.
Students’ concerns can range from anxiety 
to financial strain to severe mental issues and disorders, she said. That stress can result in fa-tigue, depression, loss of focus and suicide for those who have no way to cope.
In the state of Florida, suicide ranked No. 3 
in the top causes of death in 2009, according to National Vital Statistics Reports.
The program has staff trained to spot trou-
bled students, Day Shaw said, but it also relies on students doing their part.
“If you see someone crying on the bus, ask-
ing them what’s wrong and being that person who listens can really help,” she said.  
Students can feel isolated 
and may be dealing with deep-rooted issues even if they appear as if they have things in order, she said.
“At this point, it’s not 
about what we can avoid,” she said. “It’s about who can use the help.”
Along with the staff, students can also visit 
a website, call a telephone line to speak with someone or find contact information for help.

More than 700 springs are 
sprinkled across Florida’s land-scape, providing an ecosystem for gators and fish, an escape for visi-tors and about 90 percent of north Florida’s water supply.
But like many things across the 
state, they too face the budget ax.
On June 1, the Florida Depart-
ment of Environmental Protection announced the end of all funding for the Florida Springs Initiative and the Springs Basin Working Groups, organizations dedicated to restoring and protecting Flori-da’s springs.
“It’s just a real hard blow,” said 
Bob Knight, coordinator of the Wakulla Springs working group. “We’re seeing the springs degrad-ing, and then we hear the state no longer values them enough to fund their restoration.”
The Florida Springs Initiative 
was started in 2001 by the DEP. Its purpose was to identify problems the springs were having through scientific research, educate the public about these issues and work on projects to protect and restore the springs.Last year, the Initiative re-
ceived $514,000 in state funding.
The DEP also directed $276,000 
toward four Springs Basin Work-ing Groups — Ichetucknee, Silver, Rainbow and Wakulla.Peter Colverson, coordinator of 
the working groups for Rainbow Springs and Silver Springs, said his plans included six categories of necessary improvements: water quality, quantity of spring flow, recreation, land use and develop-ment, biodiversity, and education and outreach.
The groups were two weeks 
away from presenting these plans to the DEP when the funding cut was announced.
The funds were not intended 
to cover implementation of the plans, only to maintain the work-ing groups as representative agen-cies.
Colverson said these groups 
were the motivating forces that would have worked to garner public support and guide the springs’ restorations.
“It’s sort of like taking the en-
gine out of a car,” he said. 
This foreseeable stall in prog-
ress was what led Knight to found the Howard T. Odum Florida Springs Institute, a private, non-profit organization seeking to pick up the slack from other agencies’ losses of state funding.
“We spent a lot of money un-
derstanding the problems in the springs, but we haven’t done a lot to fix it,” Knight  said. “The need hasn’t gone away, just the state’s support.”
Christie Goss, a spokeswoman 
for the DEP, wrote in an email that the DEP is looking for ways to continue the work of the springs groups. 
“DEP’s commitment to restor -
ing these springs has not dimin-ished,” she wrote, “but it does mean we will have to explore other avenues to fulfill this com-mitment.” MONDAY, AUGUST 22, 2011 § ALLIGATOR, 17

The UF business college re-
ported inaccurate data about 
2009 graduates of its masters of business administration program to U.S. News and World Report, according to a university internal investigation.
Last August, an anonymous 
caller to the university’s ethics hotline alleged that officials from the Warrington College of Busi-ness Administration manipulat-ed data on job placement of pro-gram graduates in order to boost the program’s ranking. 
The call was followed by the 
submission of documents sup-porting the allegations.
An investigation headed by Associate Provost for Academic Affairs Angel Kwolek-Folland followed.
According to the investigation 
report, completed in September 2010, college officials “appear to have used a looser interpretation of the data than would a reason-able person” using standards used by professionals in the MBA career services field.
UF’s MBA program ranked 
39th in the U.S. News and World Report ranking based on 2009 data. 
Data on job placement figures 
highly in the publication’s meth-odology.
Data the college reported about 
the 2010 graduating class led the school to slide to 47th place.
Officials from the college have 
denied claims that they intention-ally manipulated the data. 
The allegations state that Craig Petrus, director of gradu-ate business career services, was pressured by Selcuk Erenguc, the associate dean for graduate pro-grams, to manipulate the data in order to maintain a higher rank-ing.
The complaint alleged that 
Petrus spoke of the pressure to colleagues during a July 2009 staff luncheon at a local restau-rant. Two staffers supported the claim. 
According to the investigation, 
Petrus could not recall the lun-cheon, and both he and Erenguc denied there was any pressure to manipulate the data. 
Erenguc attributed the change 
from 2009 to 2010 to a slumping economy.
According to the ranking of 
the 2009 class in U.S. News and World Report, the MBA pro-gram’s 2009 graduating class had 53 percent job placement at graduation and about 79 percent placement three months after graduation. 
The complaint alleged that the 
accurate numbers  paint a differ -
ent picture, with 37 percent of the students having jobs at gradua-tion and 53 percent having jobs three months after graduation.
The investigation found no 
evidence of collusion to create a more positive set of data.
“Whether this was the result 
of poor judgment or inexperi-ence, the end result is an inaccu-rate portrait of the employment profile” of the 2009 graduates of the MBA program, according to the investigation.
In an October memorandum 
sent in response to the investiga-tion, College of Business Admin-istration Dean John Kraft said the 2009 set of data accurately por -
trayed graduate placement and the college adhered to appropri-ate reporting standards.He said there was unrest in 
the office of career services after Petrus was selected for his posi-tion last summer, and he attrib-uted the allegations to this nega-tivity.
There are no guidelines pro-
vided by U.S. News and World Report for interpreting place-ment data. 
The standards used by UF and 
other business colleges were de-veloped by the MBA Career Ser -
vices Council, a professional as-sociation.
According to the council, the 
standards were developed in an effort to curb the perception that MBA programs inflate data for marketing purposes and to gain better spots in media-generated rankings.
The council sends informa-
tion to a third party to be avail-able for audit, but according to the investigation, the college has not regularly participated in that oversight process.

UF announced in June a new addition 
to Innovation Square, Gainesville’s under-
construction, multi-million-dollar research and creativity hub. 
The addition will be a Business Im-
provement District, which is expected to become an integral part of bringing local businesses into the fold.
Bringing businesses to the center rings 
true to values that Innovation Square stands for, said David Green, senior urban designer at Perkins+Will, the firm that de-signed the center. 
The center will act essentially as an 
incubator for entrepreneurs and provide support as they develop their ideas in Gainesville. The center does not require its businesses to be university-affiliated.
“This project will be advertised and 
have notoriety all over the world where research is done,” Green said.
The district is planned to be east of the 
Innovation Square’s Core District, between Southwest 10th Street and Northwest 2nd Street. UF averages 13 spinoff companies a 
year from its students, with 108 businesses created in total, said Ed Poppell, UF vice president of business affairs. 
There will be five entry-level jobs cre-
ated by the center for every one individual with a Ph.D., Green said. 
Master leases will be offered by UF un-
der tax rolls, which will bring new jobs and expand businesses, Poppell said. 
The research community at UF helped 
lay the foundation for Innovation Square to grow on, Green said.
“The Business Improvement District 
helps create beneficial district-wide proj-ects and helps ensure a high level of qual-ity for individual development,” Green said.
The project will utilize the natural envi-
ronment of Gainesville to create a Green-way, which will be used in environmental science research for the center, he said. The original street grid will serve as the frame-work for development for the project. 
The Greenway will go under construc-
tion quickly to increase connectivity. It is public, like the roads running through the entire center. 
The project will be privately paid for, 
without any tax dollars, Green said.

Grocery shopping is changing in Gainesville since the 
Citizens Co-op  opened its doors in July. 
For three and a half years, co-founder Elizabeth Nesbit, 
along with friend and finance manager Gretchen McIntyre, their families and the community have been working to open a cooperative grocery store. 
Starting from scratch, the Citizens Co-op, located at 435 S. 
Main St., raised more than $200,000 and accumulated more than 700 members and co-owners, Nesbit said.
In addition to the ability to do their grocery shopping 
there, members of the Citizens Co-op have several benefits, some of which include access to monthly sale items and a portion of the profits at the end of the year. 
A lifetime membership costs $100, and students can pay 
in four installations of $25.
The store houses a variety of items and departments in-cluding produce, dairy, meat and seafood, bulk, teas and spices, and health and beauty. 
One of the ideas for starting a co-op was to provide a fa-
cility that sells fresh, local food. This keeps money within the community and gives consumers peace of mind by knowing where their food comes from, Nesbit said.
Nesbit became inspired to open a co-op while traveling 
and found that cooperative grocery stores provided a wealth of community information and fresh food.
“I wanted to open one of my own,” Nesbit said. “I want-
ed to establish a place where people can come hang out, feel welcome, learn about public events and eat well.”Cooperative grocery store provides new spin on shopping“This project will be advertised and

On the first day of the Summer B semester, 
entomology and nematology professor Carl 
Barfield sat perched on a desk at the front of an auditorium in Turlington Hall, his bespec-tacled eyes surveying some 200 students who would be the recipients of the final lessons of his teaching career at UF. 
“For better or for worse,” he boomed, when 
all the shuffling and seat-swapping subsided, “this is my swan song.”
Barfield, 63, who has taught at UF for 35 
years,  retired at the end of the summer term. 
Rebecca Baldwin, who has known Barfield 
for 10 years, will take over teaching his Bugs and People class starting in the fall. She said she’ll be keeping essentially the same curricu-lum.
“He is an amazing mentor,” she said. “I’m 
super excited to continue the tradition.” 
Barfield said he began teaching at UF on 
August 1, 1976. In the five days prior, he fin-ished and defended his dissertation, married his wife, Beverly , and moved to Florida. 
Since then, he has held a number of posi-
tions, including associate director of Universi-ty Honors Program, associate director of IFAS International Programs and associate Provost.  Throughout his career, he taught about 30 different courses, including undergraduate courses in ecology and a Ph.D. course on in-tegrated pest management. He has outlasted five department heads. 
Now that he’s retiring, Barfield plans to do 
something he hasn’t had time for in the past: become a host at The Flying Biscuit Café.
“I’ve always wanted to do that,” he said. 
“I’ve got the people skills, and now I’m going to do it.” MONDAY, AUGUST 22, 2011 § ALLIGATOR, 21

Imam Abdul Malik welcomed an unusual crowd to the Islamic 
Center of Gainesville on Aug. 15. 
For the first time, the center, located at 1010 W. University Ave., 
formally invited local religious figures, community leaders and 
friends to break the daily fast of the religious month of Ramadan.
An interfaith group of Unitarians, Episcopalians, Mennonites, 
Muslims, Baha’i and Hindus gathered for dinner after sunset. 
“We need to bring across this message that there are more good 
people who want to live in harmony than people who don’t want to,” said Aqueela Khuddus, coordinator of the event. With the help of friends and family , she prepared the feast. She personally invited most of the guests. 
During Ramadan, a religious month on the lunar calendar, 
Muslims refrain from food, drink and intimacy from sunrise to sunset and then break the fast with a dinner among family and friends.
“Ramadan is the awakening of human consciousness,” said Ma-
lik, who moved to Gainesville in April to be the center’s Imam. 
“It’s one of the most sacred times of the year for Muslims,”  Ma-
lik said. 
Mayor Craig Lowe and Gainesville Police Chief Tony Jones at-
tended, and both spoke to the group briefly about Gainesville’s progress since last year’s adversity involving the Dove World Out-reach Center. 
“Last year, about this time, our community faced a challenge,” 
Lowe said. “But our community came together and met that chal-lenge. I think Gainesville could be a model for cities across the world for ways to face these challenges to our unity.”Islamic Center hosts

Those in Gainesville for Gator games 
will now have something to do Friday 
nights aside from packing the cooler for the next day.
The United Way of North Central Flor -
ida will host downtown street festivals be-fore each  home football game as part of the United Downtown event series, said Deb-bie Mason, president and CEO of United Way of North Central Florida. 
The festivals will give the congregation 
of Gator fans a chance to have some family-friendly fun before the games, she said.  
The city will close Southeast First Street 
between University Avenue and Southeast 2nd Place from 5:30 p.m. to 10 p.m. for the events.  
City Commissioner Jeanna Mastrodica-
sa hopes the event will raise awareness for United Way and give visitors a chance to see what Gainesville has to offer, she said. 
It also gives the locals who usually stay 
in a good reason to go out.
“This brings more people downtown,” 
she said. “And it will provide something positive for visitors to do.”
Christian Moreno, 20, a student at UF, 
said people avoid downtown because it’s too much effort to get there and park and then try to find entertainment. 
“But if you can drag people out there, 
there’s a lot of culture,” he said.
The events will feature local artists and 
live music and give people a chance to get involved with the United Way, Mason said. 
For people with kids, the event offers an alternative to the bar-type atmosphere of-ten associated with home-game weekends. There will be face-painting booths, bounce houses and other PG-rated things to do.
“It’ll be a strolling festival with outdoor 
activities for families to enjoy,” she said.
And for those who enjoy a drink to honor 
the football gods, a change in city ordinance will allow the sale of beer on the street dur -
ing the events, Mastrodicasa said.  
But those who envision a beer-soaked 
free-for-all will be sorely disappointed — the intent of the event is to remain family-friendly.
“This is not an outdoor party,” Mason 
said.  “This is an outdoor information and activities festival.”  
Taylor Nones, a freshman at UF, 
said it’s hard for younger fans to feel like a part of The Gator Nation when so much focus is on drinking.   “If [the festivals] nurture to families,” she said, “maybe the games won’t be so alco-hol-oriented.” 
United Downtown could give younger 
fans a chance to have a bigger piece of the gameday pie, she said.
Jeff Hickey, part-owner of Tall Paul’s 
Brew House, located off Main Street down-town, said most of the business owners downtown are in support of the events, even though some parking will be lost by closing three blocks of Southeast First Street on a Friday night.  
However, he said the downside is the 
poor lighting in downtown Gainesville.
“There’s a lot of dark spots,” he said. 
And, he added, people are scared to bring kids somewhere where a homeless person could pop out from a dark corner.
But overall, Hickey, a father of two, said 
it will be nice to have something he can take his kids to on game day weekends — other than the game, that is.

Empty stomachs, elbow-to-elbow run-ins 
and bumper-to-bumper traffic at the Rawl-
ings Hall bus stop could disappear this se-mester.
UF’s Transportation and Parking Services 
department has decided to increase the size of the Rawlings bus stop located on Newell Drive by 50 percent, said Scott Fox, the de-partment’s director.  
The Student Traffic Court will be paying 
$250,000 for the expansion with funds gained through parking tickets. 
“It identified itself as a need for expan-
sion,” Fox said.  
The bus stop now has two bus ports, and 
the expansion will add another covered bus port to increase the flow of both road and foot traffic. 
Fox said during construction, all buses 
will use the unaffected part of the port so as to not shut down the bus stop totally. If for some reason the bus system is being 
impeded by the construction, the contingen-cy plan is to have buses turn left onto McCa-rty Drive and immediately stop at McCarty Hall D. 
“We already have a natural reduction in 
riders,” Fox said. “That makes us think that we won’t need that contingency plan.” 
In addition to a new-and-improved spot to 
wait for the bus, Rawlings bus stop patrons can now grab a bite to eat during their wait. 
“This is a very high-traffic area that we 
would like to offer dining services to UF stu-dents, faculty and staff,” said Jill Rodriguez, marketing manager at Gator Dining Services, in an email. Rodriguez said the food site will offer grab-and-go breakfast, lunch, dinner, beverage, snack and sandwich options, and its prices will be competitive with off-cam-pus locations.Rawlings Hall bus stop expanding

In the event of a drug- or alco-
hol-related emergency, UF students 
can dial 911 a bit more confidently thanks to a new university policy.
Under the Medical Amnesty Pol-
icy, students will be referred by the Dean of Students Office to Gator -
Well Health Promotion Services for assessment and counseling without Student Code of Conduct charges.  
For student organizations host-
ing an event where a medical emer -
gency occurs, the act of calling for medical attention will be taken into consideration during any potential sanction hearings.
“We want students to get help,” 
said Maureen Miller, coordinator for Alcohol and Other Drug Pre-vention at GatorWell Health Pro-motion Services. 
The policy, first announced at 
the April 25 meeting of the Com-munity Alcohol Coalition, was written to reassure students that it is safe to go to regional hospitals without fear of punishment from the university. 
UF’s Emergency Room Policy, 
written in 2009, highlighted the fact that area hospitals are not al-lowed to notify police or the uni-versity in the event of an alcohol or drug-related emergency due to confidentiality laws.
The purpose of these policies, 
Miller said, is to reiterate that stu-dents are allowed to ask for help when they need it. 
“A student’s health and safety is 
our ultimate concern and number one priority,” she said.Policy promotes safetyON CAMPUS

Coach Will Muschamp said Saturday 
that he is standing behind wide receivers coach Aubrey Hill despite the assistant’s connection to the University of Miami scan-dal that was unearthed last week.
Hill allegedly had knowledge of, or di-
rect participation in, UM booster Nevin Shapiro’s disbursement of impermissible benefits to potential recruits, according to the Yahoo! Sports report. 
“I’ve talked to Aubrey after the article 
came out,” Muschamp said. “I feel very comfortable with he and I’s conversation. I support Aubrey 100 percent. I’m glad he’s here at Florida.”
Also mentioned in the report were 
sophomore Andre Debose and junior Matt Patchan, who allegedly visited Shapiro’s home as part of a prohibited recruiting ploy. 
Neither Debose nor Patchan were made 
available for comment, but the University Athletic Association released a statement saying it had contacted the NCAA and de-termined there were no eligibility questions regarding either player. 
Driskel at No. 2: At Florida’s media day 
on Aug. 5, Muschamp said one of the most important tasks facing his team would be creating separation behind John Brantley on the quarterback depth chart. 
True freshman Jeff Driskel needed just 
three weeks to generate that division. 
“Jeff has kind of distanced himself right 
now to be the backup quarterback,” Mus-champ said Tuesday. 
Muschamp cited Driskel’s command of 
the offense, intangibles, accuracy and ath-leticism as the factors that led to the fresh-man taking control of the No. 2 spot. 
Driskel has also reportedly performed 
well in team scrimmages, at one point com-pleting close to 70 percent of his passes. Se-nior Jaye Howard even referred to Driskel as “the next Tim Tebow.” 
Muschamp was quick to add that Driskel is just one or two bad days from losing the backup role to redshirt freshman Tyler Murphy or freshman Jacoby Brissett, both of whom have looked solid in practice and “have done nothing to disappoint” the coaching staff. At this point, Brantley is still firmly en-
trenched as the team’s starter.

With a new semester and a new 
football season around the corner, the Gators aren’t the 
only ones “trying to get better each and every day.”
To paraphrase head coach Will Mus-
champ — who joins yours truly as a new boss in town this season — journal-
ism is something that’s very important to us here at alligatorSports.
While Muschamp and his coaching

ter all, we are the nation’s largest (and best) student-run paper.
But like Muschamp and the shift to 
a pro-style offense and a new, booming defense, we here at alligatorSports have some changes of our own to improve our product on the field — or wherever you’re reading this.

champ is all about his “One V oice” campaign, where he is currently the sole source of any r e a l information from the

After two achingly close 
chances at a first career goal dur-
ing the Gators’ two-game swing in Miami, freshman Tessa Andu-
jar wasn’t going to miss her next opportunity.
On Sunday, the 5-foot-2 for-
ward ended her offensive woes in the opening half of No. 9 Florida’s match against FIU with a perfectly placed shot into the back-right corner of the net.“I was really happy when I 
scored, but I was also happy to help the team,” Andujar said. “To get in there and score a goal, it was really fitting.”
The 40th-minute goal sparked 
an otherwise lackluster start for Florida (2-0-0). The Gators had four offside penalties in the opening half before finally put-
ting the Golden Panthers (0-2-0) away with a second-half strike from senior Tahnai Annis, ensur-
ing the 2-0 win.
Last season’s leading scorer, Annis got on the board for the first time this year courtesy of fellow midfielder Annie Speese’s 
assist.
Andujar — a San Clemente, 
Calif., native and U-17 Puerto Rico team 
member — came off the bench against FIU 
after starting two days earlier against Miami. In the prior con-
test, she needed only two minutes on the field to make her presence known with a shot attempt that swung just wide of the goal. 
Andujar ’s next attempt, which 
came 33 minutes into the match against the Golden Panthers, fell prey to the stalwart goalkeeping of Kaitlyn Savage (five saves).
“We started off a little rough, 
but I think we got back into it and just tried to play simple,” Andu-
jar said. “They kind of came out on us hard and then we just got back into it and played well.”

When Beau Muniz walks around the UF campus, he’s al-
most never seen without his headphones.
Muniz, a UF mechanical engineering sophomore, is like 
many students in that he listens to music often and uses it to 
help him relax.“I usually just listen to music to enjoy it,” Muniz said, 
“but sometimes music is the only thing that can really calm me down if I’m mad about something.”
As it turns out, Muniz may have stumbled naturally onto 
something more effective than he realizes.
A recent study conducted at the Osaka University 
Graduate School of Medicine in Japan indicates that listen-ing to music or comedy could do more than release stress or anxiety — it actually could help people on a physical level. 
Led by researcher Eri Eguchi, the study found that sub-
jects who participated in bimonthly group sessions of lis-tening to music or comedy saw their blood pressure reduce significantly.
Those who participated in these sessions, which con-
sisted of an hour of listening to music or comedy every two weeks, saw their systolic blood pressure drop by an average of five to six points.
Michael Miller, M.D., is the director of preventive cardiol-
ogy at the University of Maryland Medical Center. According to Miller, that drop in blood pressure could be compared to a similar drop produced by losing 10 pounds, adopting a low-salt diet or taking medication to lower blood pressure.
Miller said that although the demonstrated drop is some-
what modest, it could help lower the risk of death from heart disease or stroke by 5 to 15 percent.
Eguchi said it isn’t clear exactly how music and laugh-
ter can help lower blood pressure, but he is confident in the 
study’s findings.
In contrast to the results from the groups 
that received bimonthly treatment, a con-trol group that got no treatment reported no sign of lower blood pressure.
“I think there’s definitely a physiologi-
cal effect going on, some sort of mind-heart connection,” Miller told CNN Health.
But Miller cautioned against overextending 
the study’s findings, saying he wouldn’t recom-mend replacing medication with listening to music.   However, he said, “It could increase your likeli-hood of going off medication or reducing the dosage.”    So, just how much should students read into these find-ings? One thing that’s notable is the study subjects’ charac-teristics: men and women between 40 and 74 years of age.
Jayne Standley, a professor of music therapy at Florida 
State University whose focus is medical music therapy, said that although a wealth of research shows that listening to music can affect people physically, this study still stands out.
“Music can affect a number of physiological levels,” 
Standley said. “It can reduce heart rate and help calm anxi-ety. But this study is unusual because it’s with blood pres-sure, which usually doesn’t have a response to music.”theAvenue    
Dana Burke / Alligator StaffListening to music between classes or while on the bus is an everyday habit for many students, and it’s no mystery why: Music is relaxing. However, according to a recent study conducted in Japan, listening to music also could help lower blood pressure. (Above: UF philosophy freshman Evan Rippe poses for a photo.)

KATHLEEN BOYLE
Avenue Writer
Everything old is new again, or so the say
- ing goes. If one were to anticipate a sweeping 
statement that applies to the 20-somethings of today, it would be safe to assume our gen
- eration has taken a cue from our hippie forefa
- thers with expressions like “going green” hit
- ting a defining, socially acceptable cool.
Well-stocked secondhand stores prove 
Americans’ addiction to consumption, a reflec
- tion of cultural interest in the next best thing. But embedded in this discarded materialism is a source of artistic inspiration, of reinvention, of newness. 
Zombie Vinyls, a fresh visual-art business based in Gainesville, creatively implements a take on the theory of reduce, re-use, recycle as a foundation for its handcrafted, re-purposed vinyl records. 
Officially establishing its business roots in 
the spring of 2011, Zombie Vinyls is the brain
- child of longtime friends and UF graduates Tony Feria and Matt Teper. 
The idea for their business model is rela
- tively simple and seemingly obvious, yet naturally channels a concept of reformulation that no longer necessitates a grain of salt: turn stacks of used, scratched, unwanted and out
- wardly obsolete vinyl records into an art me
- dium. 
As the name suggests and as their website 
claims, Zombie Vinyls “brings dead music back to life.” The company trades in a studio for a stencil, adorns coats of spray paint and ditches the phonograph as a testament to what 
once fell silent, now given new breath of life.
Understanding that an 
immediate association of music is inherent in the medium, Zombie Vinyls orchestrates imagery of various musical acts on the surfaces of their records. From Jimi Hendrix to Jay-Z, The Clash to Tiesto, each re-cord stands as an homage to those who have aurally entertained, inspired and embodied the conventions of various points in history . 
Swirls of tangled hue gradations set the 
stage for the headlining portraits, a foundation of spray paint affixed to the pits and grooves that formerly sourced hissing transitions be
- tween songs. 
Taking a cue from street art, the subjects of 
each record are depicted via flat layers of solid color planes, intelligently stenciled to trick the mind into believing shadows articulate the faces of the voices we love. Unlike a standard painting base such as canvas, which typically provides a neutral playing field, the LP as a picture plane allows the imagery to resonate beyond its face value.

  Students will once again be able to catch a break on 
their textbook expenses for one day this fall.
  Student Government is partnering with the UF Book-
store in the Reitz Union to bring back Discount Day, or 
Sales Tax Relief Day.
  Students will be exempt from paying the sales tax on 
textbooks bought in store Aug. 22.
  This will be the third Sales Tax Relief Day in three 
years, and Student Body President Ben Meyers said he re-ally wants to see students take advantage of the discount.
  “We’re really trying to boost it up this year,” he said.   The main goal right now is to make students aware of 
the event.
  Meyers said the discount applies only on Aug. 22 and 
only in-store. While it only applies to textbooks, he said he is working with Reitz Union Business Services and the UF Bookstore to extend the exemption to school supplies. 
  The day would not be possible without the help of the 
two groups, he said.
  “They’ve been extremely helpful and they deﬁ  nitely 
realize what a service it is for students,” Meyers said.

  The Stephen C. O’Connell Center re-
ceived a $900,000 facelift this summer that 
was unveiled to the public Saturday at UF’s Football and Volleyball Fan Day.
  David Lucier, assistant director of the 
O’Connell Center, said the largest  reno-vation was the seating. 
  Motors on the bleachers were wearing 
out, so the ﬁ  rst level of seating was re-moved and replaced with new bleachers.
  Other changes included a handrail en-
circling the lower bowl that was added to comply with safety codes and a fresh coat of paint for the outside of the building.  “I think it’s going to be a huge improve-
ment to the building,” Lucier said. “The fans are going to like it.”
  One such fan is Dillon Harrison, 36, 
who graduated from UF in 1996. Harrison traveled from the Jacksonville area to at-tend the event.
  He said he liked the look of the new 
bleachers in the lower bowl of the build-ing. 
  “Compared to when I was here, it looks 
a lot better,” he said. 
  Work on the O’Connell Center began 
in mid-May and ended in the beginning of July.

hovah’s Witness conference were held  O’Connell Center debuts

  For the the third straight year, the cost 
of tuition  for UF students is increasing 
by 15 percent this fall.
  The increase was approved by the UF 
Board of Trustees and the Board of Gov-ernors, the state university system’s gov-erning body, in June.
  The measure will raise $26 million in 
revenue for UF. According to ofﬁ  cials, the revenue will help keep the quality of education high for a university that has faced budget cuts in four of the past ﬁ  ve years.
  State legislators approved an 8-per-
cent increase in tuition in the spring. Each state university has the power to raise tuition another 7 percent, bringing the total increase to 15 percent.
  At the June Trustees meeting, UF President Bernie Machen also addressed a $9-million shortfall in need-based ﬁ  -nancial aid — an issue Student Body President Ben Meyers wanted resolved before supporting the tuition increase.  
  In addition to the tuition increase, the 
state is now requiring additional documenta-tion before dispersing Bright Futures awards.
  All students eli-
gible for the Bright Futures  Scholarship 
funds must complete the Free Application 
for Federal Student Aid, known as the FAFSA, before aid is dispersed.
  The state is requiring the paperwork 
to collect data on the population of stu-dents who received the scholarships and the students’ families. Tuition raised 15 percent 
as state budget cuts loom

Redesign
a readers’ guide
To our readers,
 
On October 19, 1906, the four-page University 
News made its debut as the student newspaper of the University of Florida. The first stories were written to inform the Gainesville community about what was happening on the brand new campus. 
Over the years, the newspaper was reincar -
nated as the the Florida Alligator and again as the Independent Florida Alligator, each time with the same mission of presenting fair and accurate con-tent to its readers. 
Now, more than 100 years after its creation, 
the Independent Florida Alligator is faced with the challenge of presenting the news as quickly and as accurately as possible in print as well as online, just like most other news outlets. 
This edition of the Alligator debuts the first 
redesign of the newspaper in more than 8 years. The Alligator Staff spent nearly a year plan-ning the new look with its readers in mind and the goal of making the paper clear and easy to read for busy UF students and members of the Gainesville community.
The Alligator is not only more pleasing to the eye, but the new design better delivers the con-tent of each story and the entire paper to you, the reader. We’ve added more space for ourselves in certain areas, and in others, we’ve paid more at-tention to the visual elements of the newspaper.
We hope that the new design draws you in 
and presents each story to you in an interesting and informative way. And we hope that our im-proved readability inspires you to venture to our website, alligator.org, and to visit our Facebook page and follow us on Twitter. 
In this semester and in the future, we want 
to continue to make sure our readers are getting the news as quickly as possible, and that is hard for us to do if they are relying solely on the print edition we put in out in our orange bins every morning. 
Now, with a new look for the print edition and 
an expanding online presentation, we are aiming to meet the challenges of this new age in news media. We will continue to serve you, our read-ers, in the best way we can, online and within the pages of our newspaper.

  Students will once again be able to catch a break on 
their textbook expenses for one day this fall.
  Student Government is partnering with the UF Book-
store in the Reitz Union to bring back Discount Day, or 
Sales Tax Relief Day.
  Students will be exempt from paying the sales tax on 
textbooks bought in store Aug. 22.
  This will be the third Sales Tax Relief Day in three 
years, and Student Body President Ben Meyers said he re-ally wants to see students take advantage of the discount.
  “We’re really trying to boost it up this year,” he said.   The main goal right now is to make students aware of 
the event.
  Meyers said the discount applies only on Aug. 22 and 
only in-store. While it only applies to textbooks, he said he is working with Reitz Union Business Services and the UF Bookstore to extend the exemption to school supplies. 
  The day would not be possible without the help of the 
two groups, he said.
  “They’ve been extremely helpful and they deﬁ  nitely 
realize what a service it is for students,” Meyers said.

  The Stephen C. O’Connell Center re-
ceived a $900,000 facelift this summer that 
was unveiled to the public Saturday at UF’s Football and Volleyball Fan Day.
  David Lucier, assistant director of the 
O’Connell Center, said the largest  reno-vation was the seating. 
  Motors on the bleachers were wearing 
out, so the ﬁ  rst level of seating was re-moved and replaced with new bleachers.
  Other changes included a handrail en-
circling the lower bowl that was added to comply with safety codes and a fresh coat of paint for the outside of the building.  “I think it’s going to be a huge improve-
ment to the building,” Lucier said. “The fans are going to like it.”
  One such fan is Dillon Harrison, 36, 
who graduated from UF in 1996. Harrison traveled from the Jacksonville area to at-tend the event.
  He said he liked the look of the new 
bleachers in the lower bowl of the build-ing. 
  “Compared to when I was here, it looks 
a lot better,” he said.

in mid-May and ended in the beginning of July.

When Beau Muniz walks around the UF campus, he’s al-
most never seen without his headphones.
Muniz, a UF mechanical engineering sophomore, is like 
many students in that he listens to music often and uses it to 
help him relax.“I usually just listen to music to enjoy it,” Muniz said, 
“but sometimes music is the only thing that can really calm me down if I’m mad about something.”
As it turns out, Muniz may have stumbled naturally onto 
something more effective than he realizes.
A recent study conducted at the Osaka University 
Graduate School of Medicine in Japan indicates that listen-ing to music or comedy could do more than release stress or anxiety — it actually could help people on a physical level. 
Led by researcher Eri Eguchi, the study found that sub-
jects who participated in bimonthly group sessions of lis-tening to music or comedy saw their blood pressure reduce significantly.
Those who participated in these sessions, which con-
sisted of an hour of listening to music or comedy every two weeks, saw their systolic blood pressure drop by an average of five to six points.
Michael Miller, M.D., is the director of preventive cardiol-
ogy at the University of Maryland Medical Center. According to Miller, that drop in blood pressure could be compared to a similar drop produced by losing 10 pounds, adopting a low-salt diet or taking medication to lower blood pressure.
Miller said that although the demonstrated drop is some-
what modest, it could help lower the risk of death from heart disease or stroke by 5 to 15 percent.
Eguchi said it isn’t clear exactly how music and laugh-
ter can help lower blood pressure, but he is confident in the study’s findings.
In contrast to the results from the groups 
that received bimonthly treatment, a con-trol group that got no treatment reported no sign of lower blood pressure.
“I think there’s definitely a physiologi-
cal effect going on, some sort of mind-heart connection,” Miller told CNN Health.
But Miller cautioned against overextending 
the study’s findings, saying he wouldn’t recom-mend replacing medication with listening to music.   However, he said, “It could increase your likeli-hood of going off medication or reducing the dosage.”    So, just how much should students read into these find-ings? One thing that’s notable is the study subjects’ charac-teristics: men and women between 40 and 74 years of age.
Jayne Standley, a professor of music therapy at Florida 
State University whose focus is medical music therapy, said that although a wealth of research shows that listening to music can affect people physically, this study still stands out.
“Music can affect a number of physiological levels,” 
Standley said. “It can reduce heart rate and help calm anxi-ety. But this study is unusual because it’s with blood pres-sure, which usually doesn’t have a response to music.”theAvenue

Listening to music between classes or while on the bus is an everyday habit for many students, and it’s no mystery why: Music is relaxing. However, according to a recent study conducted in Japan, listening to music also could help lower blood pressure. (Above: UF philosophy freshman Evan Rippe poses for a photo.)

Do you think being “friends with benefits” ever works out? Answer the poll question on alligator.org/the_avenue.Zombie Vinyls finds a new art medium in old records
KATHLEEN BOYLE
Avenue Writer
Everything old is new again, or so the say-
ing goes. If one were to anticipate a sweeping 
statement that applies to the 20-somethings of today, it would be safe to assume our gen-
eration has taken a cue from our hippie forefa-
thers with expressions like “going green” hit-
ting a defining, socially acceptable cool.
Well-stocked secondhand stores prove 
Americans’ addiction to consumption, a reflec-
tion of cultural interest in the next best thing. But embedded in this discarded materialism is a source of artistic inspiration, of reinvention, of newness. 
Zombie Vinyls, a fresh visual-art business based in Gainesville, creatively implements a take on the theory of reduce, re-use, recycle as a foundation for its handcrafted, re-purposed vinyl records. 
Officially establishing its business roots in 
the spring of 2011, Zombie Vinyls is the brain-
child of longtime friends and UF graduates Tony Feria and Matt Teper. 
The idea for their business model is rela-
tively simple and seemingly obvious, yet naturally channels a concept of reformulation that no longer necessitates a grain of salt: turn stacks of used, scratched, unwanted and out-
wardly obsolete vinyl records into an art me-
dium. 
As the name suggests and as their website 
claims, Zombie Vinyls “brings dead music back to life.” The company trades in a studio for a stencil, adorns coats of spray paint and ditches the phonograph as a testament to what once fell silent, now given new breath of life.
Understanding that an 
immediate association of music is inherent in the medium, Zombie Vinyls orchestrates imagery of various musical acts on the surfaces of their records. From Jimi Hendrix to Jay-Z, The Clash to Tiesto, each re-
cord stands as an homage to 
those who have aurally entertained, inspired and embodied the conventions of various points in history . 
Swirls of tangled hue gradations set the 
stage for the headlining portraits, a foundation of spray paint affixed to the pits and grooves that formerly sourced hissing transitions be-
tween songs. 
Taking a cue from street art, the subjects of 
each record are depicted via flat layers of solid color planes, intelligently stenciled to trick the mind into believing shadows articulate the faces of the voices we love. Unlike a standard painting base such as canvas, which typically provides a neutral playing field, the LP as a picture plane allows the imagery to resonate beyond its face value.  
Tony Feria is the founding artistic mind be-
hind Zombie Vinyls, which he began about a music

Today’s question: Do you like the Alligator’s new look? 
115 TOTAL VOTES72% YES
28% NOLast week’s question: Are you ready?
   So much about today is new.
  It’s a new semester. We have new students. We 
have a new head football coach.
  Welcome back to Gainesville. Welcome back to school. 
  Welcome to a new-look Alligator.  If you haven’t already noticed, the Alligator you’ll ﬁ  nd 
in our orange racks looks a little bit different.
  We decided to get a makeover for the ﬁ  rst time in al-
most 10 years. It’s been a long time coming — about nine months — and our staff is extremely proud of our ﬁ  nished product. Needless to say, this is our baby.
  We wanted to, as always, keep the readers in mind as 
we set about this makeover. We wanted to please your eyes and draw you into our stories. We hope what you see before you does the job.
  Working on this massive edition and seeing it placed 
on the page with the design changes was as exciting a mo-ment as any of us have had, but we realized that it wasn’t just about being aesthetically pleased.
  This is signaling something more.   As student journalists, we spend inordinate amounts 
of time studying not only the mechanics of gathering the news and serving it you, but also the preferences of you, the consumer, when it comes to ﬁ  nding the news.
  In this age where physical newspapers are seemingly 
becoming more and more archaic, we know we have to make adjustments. It’s not just about the ink on your ﬁ  n-gers anymore; it’s also about the keyboard and screen you now rely on for news.
  Keep an eye out this semester for a new focus on our 
online presentation. We plan on engaging readers like we never have before, whether it be through our Facebook page or through our tweets. It’s clear that our audience is moving with the times. 
  We don’t plan on getting left behind.  That’s not to say that we are going to shortchange our 
print edition. This redesign gives us a chance to stretch our legs in a few ways. On some pages we have more space, and on others, we sacriﬁ  ced some space to improve  visual elements. There’s a more uni-formed style across sections.
  To go along with our re-
focused mission to improve our online presence, we will advertise our website more prominently (note the URL directly underneath the logo). On many occasions, we will be directing readers to  www.alligator.org or to our social media sites to ﬁ  nd out more about the stories we report. 
  We want you to know that we feel the tremendous 
weight of the responsibility we have. We are your student newspaper, and we will strive to serve you and provide you with the best news you can get.
  If you ever have any concerns about your community, 
whether it be on campus or in the City of Gainesville, let us know. We want to make sure we’re reporting on the is-sues that matter most to you.
  One quick turn to page two and you’ll ﬁ  nd all of our 
names and emails on the masthead. Don’t hesitate to drop us a line when you have something to say.
  And if you think you can contribute to the Alligator by 
writing for us, stay tuned.
  In the coming days, we’ll announce the date of our 
open house where we’ll welcome anyone crazy enough to want to get involved in our daily grind.
  We’ll be here with big smiles, ready to accept resumes, 
writing samples and hugs.  
  And, of course, we’ll have pizza.  Elizabeth Behrman is a journalism senior and editor-in-
chief of the Alligator. Josh Isom is a journalism senior and managing editor / online. Joey Flechas is a journalism senior and managing editor / print.  Alligator debuts new look, new focus
   If there is one thing we, as a nation, need to start picking 
on, it’s homeless shelters. 
If we don’t get these so-called “charities” under con-
trol, we will be facing a ﬁ  asco that Enron execs would call too risky. 
Google it, freshmen.   T o the pleasure of many activists on campus and around 
Gainesville, the city voted Thursday to  end the 130 meal-limit placed on all soup kitchens in the area. 
This long-standing issue ﬁ  nally  seems to have reached 
a conclusion we can support.
  Now , soup kitchens in Gainesville will be given a three-
hour window to serve as many people as they can reason-ably ﬁ  t into their space. 
  Although the limit had been on the books for a while, 
the city started enforcing it in 2009 when local developers began to complain that the St. Francis House, a shelter and soup kitchen on South Main Street, was serving more than 130 people a day. 
  W ell, how dare they?  Though Gainesville’s homeless population is signiﬁ  -
cant, the homeless aren’t known for being violent. 
Supporters of the limit also argue that the population 
creates an eye sore and might be unattractive to their pa-trons. 
  The St. Francis House legally obtained its space and 
should be able to use it as it sees ﬁ  t. 
Local residents and businesses should not be using the 
government to force nonproﬁ  ts to behave in ways that make themselves more comfortable. 
  The St. Francis House, like other soup kitchens in the 
area, does not receive funding from local governments. Nonproﬁ  ts should not be restricted by many rules and regulations, especially when their mission is anything but malevolent.
  While this may not have been part of the debate, one 
has to wonder why governments require  places like soup kitchens to meet so many licensing requirements just to open their doors.  
Surely someone who goes through the trouble of pur-
chasing a space and cooking hundreds of meals a day to feed the homeless isn’t looking to cause any trouble. Their whole goal is to help people.   
At its most fundamental level, the purpose of govern-
ment is to protect us. 
Who is really protected by these burdensome steps re-
quired of philanthropists and charities?    Meal limit ﬁ  nally 
served correctly 
City does right thing

According to a new study con -
ducted by UF’s Department of Be -
havioral Science and Community 
Health, 20 percent of drinkers are  underage, and those who are under -
age stay out later than those who are  
21 years old or older.
“Gainesville has a pretty large  
drinking culture,” David Munroe, 
a UF history senior, said. “Students  
have pretty large social networks so  they can find fake IDs and eventu -
ally you can find someone to borrow  
an ID from.”
The study, published in the June  
issue of the Journal of American  
College Health, outlines the age of  
drinkers, blood-alcohol levels and drinkers’ intentions of driving later  
that evening.
The findings showed that more  
than half of the participants were in -
toxicated while being surveyed. 
Fifty-five percent of the men  
and 59 percent of the women had a blood-alcohol level of 0.08 or higher. 
The underage drinkers were found  
to have higher amounts of alcohol  
than those of age.

sign taped to a cardboard box on the counter of lo -
cal coffee shop Déjà Brew.
“We’re closed. We’ll be back at 7 a.m.,” the no -

Before Saturday, Déjà Brew was open 24 hours a 
day, seven days a week.
But this week, the shop was open from 7 a.m. 
to 3 p.m.
On Friday at 3 p.m., the coffee house will close  
for the last time and renovation will begin during

In addition to losing its title as the top party 
school, UF may slip to No. 2 in enrollment  
among state universities this year.
The University of Central Florida  is pro -
jecting about 52,000 students. Just over 49,000 
were registered at UF by Friday afternoon.
UF spokesman Steve Orlando said it’s like -ly that UF’s numbers will grow, but it doesn’t  
appear enrollment will reach 52,000.
The number of students enrolled last fall at  
UF was 52,112. 
UCF spokesman Chad Binette said the  
school expects enrollment to increase by about  
1,750 from last fall because of a high retention  
rate — the percentage of freshman who return  
the following fall — and a record number of  
transfer students, most of whom transfer from 
Florida’s community colleges.UCF has registered 4,700 transfer students  
this fall, Binette said, and has a retention rate  
of 85 percent, compared to UF’s  
94 percent.
UF announced a plan in April  
that aims to reduce enrollment  
from 2007’s 51,725 students by  
4,000 over four years.
“It’s kind of a desired outcome,” Orlando  
said.
The expected drop will work in favor of  students, he said, by lowering UF’s high facul -
ty-student ratio, which is more than 20-to-1.
The reduction in enrollment will also allow  
UF to increase the percentage of graduate stu -
dents versus undergraduates, he said.
According to a December list from the  
American School & University magazine  
Web site, UF had the third highest enrollment  
among U.S. universities, behind Ohio State  
and Arizona State universities. UCF placed  
fifth.UCF enrollment may beat UF’s by about 3,000 this fall

WASHINGTON (AP) — People who multi-
task the most are the ones who are worst at it.
That’s the surprising conclusion of re-
searchers at Stanford University, who found 
multitaskers are more easily distracted and 
less able to ignore irrelevant information than 
people who do less multitasking.
“The huge finding is, the more media peo-
ple use the worse they are at using any media. 
We were totally shocked,” Clifford Nass, a 
professor at Stanford’s communications de-partment, said in a telephone interview.
The researchers studied 262 college under-
graduates, dividing them into high and low 
multitasking groups and comparing memory, 
ability to switch from one task to another and 
being able to focus on a task. Their findings are 
reported in Tuesday’s edition of Proceedings 
of the National Academy of Sciences.
When it came to such essential abilities, 
people who did a lot of multitasking didn’t 
score as well as others, Nass said.Study: Mulitaskers have more trouble ignoring distractionsMONDAY, AUGUST 22, 2011

15 home runs and a school-record 85 RBIs as a freshman, a senior season in Gainesville seemed unlikely.
But as the clock struck midnight 
last Monday and the calendar turned to Aug. 16, that once-doubtful senior campaign became a reality. 
Last Monday was the signing dead-
line for players who were selected in Major League Baseball’s First-Year Player Draft and still had college eli-gibility. 
Tucker and several other Gators 
turned down professional contracts to return to Florida.
Tucker was drafted in the 16th 
round by the Colorado Rockies after hitting .308 with 15 home runs and a team-leading 74 RBIs last season as the Gators advanced to the College World Series final.“Anytime you can get back your 
three-hole hitter for his senior year, it’s a huge lift,” Florida head coach Kevin O’Sullivan told FightinGators.com. 
“These are the types of things that 
need to happen if you want to be in the championship run again. It’s impos-sible to replace his bat. We feel very fortunate and very excited that he’s coming back.” 
Along with Tucker, two other ju-
niors who were among the school-record 11 Gators drafted decided to return for their senior seasons. Both outfielder Tyler Thompson, 
who was selected by the Washington Nationals in the 46th round, and right-handed reliever Greg Larson, who was chosen in the 29th round by the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, will come back to Gainesville. 
Thompson returned following an 
injury-plagued junior campaign, while Larson will bolster a solid bullpen af-ter he posted a 2.09 ERA in 33 appear -
ances last season.
In addition to the returning seniors, 
four members of Florida’s highly tout-ed recruiting class went unsigned. 
Infielders Casey Turgeon (22nd 
round, New York Mets) and Joshua Tobias (31st round, Washington Na-tionals), righty John Magliozzi (35th round, Tampa Bay Rays) and right-handed pitcher and outfielder Ryan Harris (37th round, New York Yan-kees) all turned down MLB contracts to come to Gainesville and play for O’Sullivan, adding necessary depth to an already strong returning team.

Coach Will Muschamp said Saturday 
that he is standing behind wide receivers coach Aubrey Hill despite the assistant’s connection to the University of Miami scan-dal that was unearthed last week.
Hill allegedly had knowledge of, or di-
rect participation in, UM booster Nevin Shapiro’s disbursement of impermissible benefits to potential recruits, according to the Yahoo! Sports report. 
“I’ve talked to Aubrey after the article 
came out,” Muschamp said. “I feel very comfortable with he and I’s conversation. I support Aubrey 100 percent. I’m glad he’s here at Florida.”
Also mentioned in the report were 
sophomore Andre Debose and junior Matt Patchan, who allegedly visited Shapiro’s home as part of a prohibited recruiting ploy. 
Neither Debose nor Patchan were made 
available for comment, but the University Athletic Association released a statement saying it had contacted the NCAA and de-termined there were no eligibility questions regarding either player. 
Driskel at No. 2: At Florida’s media day 
on Aug. 5, Muschamp said one of the most important tasks facing his team would be creating separation behind John Brantley on the quarterback depth chart. 
True freshman Jeff Driskel needed just 
three weeks to generate that division. 
“Jeff has kind of distanced himself right 
now to be the backup quarterback,” Mus-champ said Tuesday. 
Muschamp cited Driskel’s command of 
the offense, intangibles, accuracy and ath-leticism as the factors that led to the fresh-man taking control of the No. 2 spot. 
Driskel has also reportedly performed 
well in team scrimmages, at one point com-pleting close to 70 percent of his passes. Se-nior Jaye Howard even referred to Driskel as “the next Tim Tebow.” 
Muschamp was quick to add that Driskel is just one or two bad days from losing the backup role to redshirt freshman Tyler Murphy or freshman Jacoby Brissett, both of whom have looked solid in practice and “have done nothing to disappoint” the coaching staff. At this point, Brantley is still firmly en-
trenched as the team’s starter.

Florida coach Will Muschamp said Saturday he’s comfortable with wide receivers

UF FOOTBALLMuschamp backs implicated assistant
With a new semester and a new 
football season around the corner, the Gators aren’t the 
only ones “trying to get better each and every day.”
To paraphrase head coach Will Mus-
champ — who joins yours truly as a new boss in town this season — journal-ism is something that’s very important to us here at alligatorSports.
While Muschamp and his coaching 
staff can’t guarantee you a Southeastern Conference or national championship in their first season, my staff and I can guarantee you the finest sports section in the SEC — heck, even in America. Af-ter all, we are the nation’s largest (and best) student-run paper.
But like Muschamp and the shift to 
a pro-style offense and a new, booming defense, we here at alligatorSports have 
some changes of our own to improve our product on the field — or wherever you’re reading this.
Be heard: 
While Mus-
champ is all about his “One V oice” campaign, where he is currently the sole source of any real information from the 
team, we here at alligatorSports want to know what you, the readers, think. 
We’re going to try our hand at a 
mailbag feature where we field reader questions about the football team — and other UF sports — life, or anything you may want to ask us. Questions can be submitted on Twitter: @alligatorSports. If you’re living in the Stone Age, you can email them to sports@alligator.org.

After two achingly close 
chances at a first career goal dur -
ing the Gators’ two-game swing in Miami, freshman Tessa Andu-jar wasn’t going to miss her next opportunity.
On Sunday, the 5-foot-2 for -
ward ended her offensive woes in the opening half of No. 9 Florida’s match against FIU with a perfectly placed shot into the back-right corner of the net.“I was really happy when I 
scored, but I was also happy to help the team,” Andujar said. “To get in there and score a goal, it was really fitting.”
The 40th-minute goal sparked 
an otherwise lackluster start for Florida (2-0-0). The Gators had four offside penalties in the opening half before finally put-ting the Golden Panthers (0-2-0) away with a second-half strike from senior Tahnai Annis, ensur -
ing the 2-0 win.
Last season’s leading scorer, Annis got on the board for the first time this year courtesy of fellow midfielder Annie Speese’s 
assist.
Andujar — a San Clemente, 
Calif., native and U-17 Puerto 
Rico team 
member — came off the bench against FIU 
after starting two days earlier against Miami. In the prior con-test, she needed only two minutes on the field to make her presence known with a shot attempt that swung just wide of the goal. 
Andujar’s next attempt, which 
came 33 minutes into the match against the Golden Panthers, fell prey to the stalwart goalkeeping of Kaitlyn Savage (five saves).
“We started off a little rough, 
but I think we got back into it and just tried to play simple,” Andu-jar said. “They kind of came out on us hard and then we just got back into it and played well.”

more unorthodox: the Wildcat. 
Jordan Reed, Jeff Demps, 
Trey Burton and Chris Rainey have all taken direct snaps in UF’s variation of the wildcat formation. 
Demps and Rainey both ad-
mitted to having limited expe-rience in the configuration, but each said they are enjoying the experience thus far. 
“I haven’t been in there 
that much for the Wildcat, but when I got in there it was pretty fun,” Demps said. “Me playing quarterback and stuff, I can see the holes a little faster and hit it.”
Demps and Rainey, who 
Muschamp said are far and away the two best running backs on the roster, could po-tentially be asked to throw as part of the formation. 
“I think there’s a chance,” 
Demps said. “Slim to none, but it could happen. … I’ve got to get with coach Weis and work on my arm.”
Injury update: Muschamp 
confirmed reports Saturday that cornerback Jeremy Brown had missed the last week of practice with a knee injury. He added that Brown is expected to be back in practice Wednes-day or Thursday.

Reed has recovered from a hamstring injury that Mus-champ said sidelined him for three or four days last week.

The 2010 Southeastern Conference Freshman of the Year, forward Taylor Travis 
scored a goal and notched an assist in Florida’s 2-0 shutout of Miami on Friday. 
Taylor shines in season opener
following Andujar’s game-clinching strike, 
totaling 12 shots for the game — twice as many as FIU.
“[Andujar’s] goal showed a relentless-
ness, which is one of the core values of our team,” UF coach Becky Burleigh said. “I thought Tahnai’s goal was a culmination of great passing and combination plays be-tween pretty much everyone on our team.”
Continuing with the early youth move-
ment, Burleigh put freshman keeper Taylor Burke in goal for the first time against FIU after senior Brooke Chancey started Friday.
Both ended with clean sheets, due in 
large part to Florida’s tough defense on the back line.“We’ve been focusing on finishing out 
games and trying to get shutouts whereas last season we would give up goals late in games,” Annis said. “We’re trying to focus on our defense as much as our offense right now.”
With the win, Florida improved to 2-0-0 
after downing Miami (1-1-0) in Coral Gables on Friday . 
The Gators received a late first-half goal 
from 2010 Southeastern Conference Fresh-man of the Year Taylor Travis followed by a booming 51st-minute long shot by freshman midfielder Havana Solaun to seal a decisive 2-0 victory over the Hurricanes.
The two scorers were Florida’s first subs 
after a hectic opening 23 minutes, and helped boost UF to its third consecutive season-opening win over Miami.GAtors , from page 32

If there’s one thing Brooke Chancey 
has learned as a career backup goalie at UF, it’s that she has to earn every minute she gets on the pitch.
With a void left at keeper heading into 
this season following the departure of Ka-tie Fraine, Chancey, a senior, thought she would have a clear path to finally crack-ing the No. 9 Gators’ starting lineup.
“I’ve been waiting three long years, 
patiently waiting, to get this opportunity and I couldn’t be more excited to finally have my chance to show them what I have,” she said.   
But standing in her way of starting 
minutes, and catching UF coach Becky Burleigh’s eye early on, has been 6-foot-1 athletic newcomer Taylor Burke, who will play soccer and jump for the track and field team this year. 
Through two games, the position bat-
tle between both the senior and the fresh-man has been close enough to keep the starting spot open.
“That’s one area that’s pretty unsettled 
at this point, but I think both of them bring different strengths to the table,” Burleigh said. “I really like Taylor’s distribution, especially from the ground. She does a re-ally good job at finding the open player. Obviously her size and athleticism are huge factors.”
The 5-foot-6 Chancey, meanwhile, 
brings more poise than raw ability at the position, her coach said. With three years of college experience under her belt, the senior’s calming presence could be des-perately needed for a team opening with four consecutive games on the road.
Last season, in the first start of her 
career, Chancey filled in for an injured Fraine during the pressure-packed South-eastern Conference Tournament final and delivered a 1-0 shutout masterpiece for the Gators.
“We are so thankful she could step up 
and make as big of an impact as she could that game,” junior midfielder McKenzie Barney said. “That’s a huge plus. She works so hard for our team. It was huge for her, but at the same time, it’s a new year.”
Barney said the team is equally confi-
dent in Burke, who brings in an impres-sive résumé from her prep career in Me-dina, Ohio.
As a first team All-American and Ga-
torade National Player of the Year final-ist, Burke broke the Ohio record for most consecutive shutout minutes in her senior year with 1,243.
Adding to her mounting accolades 
during track season, the multi-sport star set the 2010 national mark in the high jump with a state-record leap of 6-1 1/4 inches to win the Ohio Division 1 outdoor state title for the third consecutive year.
But even with the hype surrounding 
her early playing days at Florida and the chance she could play immediately, Burke recognizes the tension starting la-bels could bring to the team.
“I wouldn’t really call it a competition, 
we’re really good teammates, we’re get-ting really close and we’re just trying to push each other in practice,” Burke said. “I’m definitely confident in both of us. The coaches are going to make their deci-sion and I know whatever they make will be a good decision.” Competition open at keeper
“We are so thankful she could 
step up and make as big of an im-
pact as she could that game.”

A friend messaged me from Las Vegas 
last week regarding the over/under set for Florida’s win total this season, 
its first under coach Will Muschamp.
The seemingly all-knowing oddsmakers 
set the mark at eight (!) wins for the Gators. After staring at a Florida schedule toting six matchups with preseason top-25 teams, in-cluding three with top-five teams, I’d be hard-pressed to take the over.
That’s not to say I condone gambling. This 
is college football, and I wouldn’t dare sully the integrity of the game.
However, if I were a betting man, I’d take 
the under because Muschamp’s inaugural season will be a rocky one.
Never mind the daunting schedule — this 
team has too many question marks on both sides of the ball to reach that nine-win thresh-old.
Will the team’s pass rush make a turn-
around from a dismal 2010? Who will replace Ahmad Black and Janoris Jenkins in the sec-ondary if that pass rush fails (again)?
Who will be the go-to receiver, and will 
John Brantley even be able to find that as-of-yet-determined receiver? And of course, how will the offensive line hold up after losing three starters to the NFL?
Those questions 
will be masked early when the Gators start the season 4-0 with wins over pow-erhouses Florida At-lantic and UAB, and Southeastern Con-
ference East foes Tennessee and Kentucky.
But then the calendar will turn to October, 
and things will get ugly.
Remember those six top-25 opponents? 
Four of them come in October — and only one 
within the friendly confines of The Swamp.
The Gators will drop three straight against 
Alabama, LSU and Auburn before a “season-salvaging” win in the World’s Largest Out-door Cocktail Party at the end of October.
That win against Georgia will only stall the 
hemorrhaging, though. Florida’s throttling of Furman will be sandwiched by losses to the Ol’ Ball Coach and the team formerly known as the School Out West.
At 7-5, the Gators’ season will end much 
like it did last year: in disappointment and a second-tier bowl game in central Florida.38, ALLIGATOR §  MONDAY, AUGUST 22, 2011
alligatorSports columnists predict 2011 football season 
Experts across the nation, and across 
this page, have outlined why fans should expect disappointment in 2011.
John Brantley isn’t who we thought he 
was, Janoris Jenkins and Ahmad Black are gone, and the offensive line is in shambles.
But there are two reasons that might not 
matter: Will Muschamp and Charlie Weis.
The tag-team of coaching wizards has had 
success everywhere they’ve been, and there’s no reason for that to change at Florida.
In eight seasons as a collegiate defensive 
coordinator, Muschamp led six top-10 units.
His first year calling the plays, he took 
LSU from No. 75 nationally in total defense to No. 8. A year later, the Tigers touted the top-ranked defense and brought a national championship to Baton Rouge, La.
Never before has a Muschamp-coordinat-
ed defense been worse than it was in the year before he took the reins — a scary proposition as he inherits a UF defense that ranked ninth nationally a season ago.
The real concern is on offense, where the 
Gators finished No. 82 in 2010. Enter Weis, who took over the No. 81 offense when he started at Notre Dame in 2005 and instantly elevated it to 10th.In two sea-
sons under Weis, quarterback Brady Quinn bested his totals from the pre-vious two seasons by 2,928 yards and 43 touchdowns, all while throwing 11 fewer interceptions.
Given Quinn’s pro career, it’s easy to heap 
the praise on Weis. 
Coordinators like Weis are often given the 
moniker of “mad scientist,” and anyone who watched Florida’s offense last season knows there are enough ineffectual, seemingly life-less parts for Weis to create his own version of Frankenstein’s monster.
Weis’ best-case scenario resembles the 
creation from Mary Shelley’s novel: gigantic, fast, smart, unstoppable.
The worst-case? An abomination remi-
niscent of the modern interpretations: slow, hulking, more known for it’s frightening style than incompetent substance.
The difference between the two could be 
the difference between a 10-win success story and a five-win meltdown.
Tom Green
twitter: @tomas_verdeIf you’ve been paying attention when Will 
Muschamp speaks, chances are you’re confident. You can feel it. Brimming with 
eat-you-alive swagger, Coach Boom has you believin’ that 2010 couldn’t possibly be re-peated.
Florida’s new head honcho walks with a 
limp, and he doesn’t have gout or a broken toe. Muschamp’s “One V oice” campaign — where he is the only coach speaking to the media — has somehow blossomed a resur -
gence of belief in Gator Nation. Fans see po-tential here in Gainesville.
But as even Muschamp will tell you, poten-
tial doesn’t mean squat. It means you haven’t done anything — perfect for these Gators.
The players on this roster wear the same 
orange-and-blue uniforms of those who hoisted the national championship trophy twice in the last five years. They practice in the same nuclear-hot weather. They even run out of the same tunnel on game days.
But that’s where the similarities stop.This isn’t your big brother’s Florida 
Gators. 
This isn’t the team that incited thousands 
of Gainesvillians to rush the streets of Mid-town in 2006-07 and again in 2008-09, cling-ing to light poles and chanting fight songs into the night.
This team isn’t 
the best in the coun-try . It’s not even the best in the state. Ex-pectations need to follow suit.
Fans need to realize what Urban Meyer ac-
complished in his short time at Florida is an aberration. They need to understand that the Gators are implementing brand new systems under a brand new coaching staff, all while playing quite possibly the most difficult schedule in the nation.
The Gators are not No. 1.In fact, they’ll be lucky to win one game in 
the month of October, when Florida plays Al-abama, Auburn, LSU and Georgia. Only one of those games is in The Swamp — against the preseason Southeastern Conference fa-vorite Crimson Tide.
Sure, Florida has the usual cupcakes on the 
schedule, meaning six wins and bowl eligibil-ity should be a lock. But don’t let pseudo con-
fidence and potential trick you into expecting greatness this season.
Boom … expect a lot of that from the de-fense this year. There better be.
If Will Muschamp wants a fast start, 
if the players and returning coaches want to wash the sour taste that was the 2010 season out of their mouths, they will need to lean on the D with a dose of conservative offense.
For all the sizzle that came from the Age of 
Urban (or Tebow, or Percy), it was always the team’s defense that proved key . During the 2006 title run, when Chris Leak validated his career and Tim Tebow stole your hearts, UF ranked a respectable 19th in total offense. The defense, meanwhile, was sixth.
Remember pre-Jaguars Reggie Nelson? 
Remember long-hair-don’t-care Earl Ever -
ett chasing down Troy Smith sans helmet? (boom).
And in 2008, more of the same. The of-
fense was ranked 15th, defense was ninth, and the Gators sealed the season by holding Sam Bradford and the Sooners’ super-sexy no-huddle attack to 14 points. (boom).
If this year’s squad wants even a taste of 
that kind of success, the Gators will again need to take no prisoners on defense. Sure, Charlie Weis has four Super Bowl rings; but, more than masterminding explosive offenses, he has been suc-cessful because he adequately fits his style to the person-nel, something that held UF back under former coordinator Steve Addazio.
Weis has already 
joked you can count 
on no hands how many times Johnny B will run the option. Instead, expect Florida to play to its strengths: Jeff Demps and Chris Rainey . 
Which brings us back to the defense, the 
reason Muschamp was hired. Though the team lost its two best players (Ahmad Black and Janoris Jenkins), it should make up for it with a stronger defensive line, led by Domin-ique Easley, Omar Hunter, Jaye Howard and Sharrif Floyd (boom).
Muschamp is also taking the leash off the 
animal that is Ronald Powell (boom). And ex-pect Jon Bostic and Jelani Jenkins to take steps forward at linebacker (boom).
Maybe Weis can get the offense dropping 
points like it’s 1996. But UF’s success won’t be measured by that. This year, it’s going to be all about the hits, the picks, the booms.

John Brantley is all too familiar with 
the rigors of a Southeastern Conference schedule. 
As UF’s 2010 starter, Brantley guided 
the Gators to a mediocre 4-4 record in the SEC, tying Florida’s worst finish in terms of winning percentage since 1986. 
Still, Brantley believes the toughest 
month of his UF career may be ahead of him. 
The Gators face a brutal October slate, 
as a home tilt against Alabama and the annual showdown against Georgia sand-wich road trips to LSU and Auburn. 
“That’s a tough month,” Brantley, a 
redshirt senior, said. “There’s four great teams we’ve got to face.”
Both Alabama and LSU are ranked 
in the top five of the AP preseason poll. Alabama, which has beaten Florida in five of their last seven meetings, checked in at No. 2 in the preseason AP Top 25, while LSU came in two spots below at No. 4. 
A trip to Auburn means a showdown 
with the defending national champions, who are 14-2 at home in the last two years. 
Florida closes October with the 
World’s Largest Outdoor Cocktail Par -
ty, a contest in which the Gators were pushed to overtime a season ago. 
Both Auburn (No. 23) and Georgia 
(No. 19) joined Alabama and LSU in the Top 25 when the AP released its rank-ings Saturday. 
“That’s what we’re preparing for 
now,” Brantley said of the October sched-ule. “The tough camp and the hot days is preparing us for later in the season when we’re starting to get beat up.”If there is any consolation for Flor -
ida, the season’s first three games will be played in Ben Hill Griffin Stadium against Florida Atlantic, UAB and Ten-nessee. 
The Gators are 117-16 at home since 
1990, the best winning percentage in the nation in that span. 
That mark is bolstered by a dominat-
ing 55-4 performance in non-conference games. 
“Being at home those first three games 
is going to help us out just to get every-thing together and figure out what we do best,” Brantley said. 
Between the season-opening three-
game homestand and the nightmarish October is a trip to face Kentucky, a team UF has beaten in 24 consecutive match-ups. 
In November, Florida will host two 
relatively soft opponents in Vanderbilt and Furman. UF will also travel to South Carolina (No. 12) to take on the SEC East favorite Gamecocks before finally closing the season at home against rival power -
house Florida State (No. 6) on Nov. 26.

Already thin on the offensive line 
with just 13 scholarship players, Florida needs three guys whose ca-reers have been marred by setbacks to step up this season.
Xavier Nixon had a mysteri-

Matt Patchan, a redshirt junior, 
has seen action in just 15 games dur -
ing his four-year career thanks to in-juries to his wrist, knee and leg. 
James Wilson came to Florida 
from Ponte Vedra Nease High as the No. 1  guard prospect in 2007, but missed the final 10 games of the  2010 season after injuring his left knee.
But Nixon is back to his playing 
weight of 290 pounds, and Patchan and Wilson are both finally healthy. According to coach Will Muschamp, the offensive line is starting to come together.
Nixon is in line to start at left 
tackle, while Patchan is running with the first team at right tackle and Wilson is competing to start at left guard. 
Teammates are glad they’re back.“He’s going to be the same player 
that I’ve seen since I’ve been here,” Nixon said of Patchan. 
“He’s an explosive player off the ball, he’s real fiery. He’s feisty.”
The Gators are implementing a 
new pro-style offense under coor -
dinator Charlie Weis, one that must be able to pound the ball in the run game and provide adequate pass protection for quarterback John Brantley.
Brantley said having a veteran 
presence on the offensive line has helped his confidence. 
“They know their stuff, they 
know their offense,” Brantley said. “Now that they have the pads on, we’re cleaning everything up and everything’s looking good.”
Since the spring, Muschamp has 
harped on the importance of play in the trenches. 
The communication between the 
group is imperative, as all five guys must be on the same page with the run and pass game. With injuries limiting snaps earlier in the year, fall practice has been a proving ground, sorting out the starters through open competition.
Ian Silberman, Kyle Koehne and 
Wilson are battling for the job at left guard. Jonotthan Harrison is the leader at center, but Sam Robey and Dan Wenger have also practiced with the first team. Jon Halapio is likely the right guard and Patchan is the front-runner at right tackle, with Chaz Green rotating. 
Muschamp said said he’s pleased 
with the progress but said it’s too early to name a definitive starting lineup and depth is still a concern. 
“We’ve got good players. It’s 
just you’d just like to have a deeper group,” he said. “Their movement, their toughness, what they bring to the table, we’re excited about that group. But you’d like to have 18 in-stead of 13.”
Nick Alajajian, Silberman and 
Wenger provide versatility, as they can play at any spot inside. 
Freshmen Trip Thurman and 
Tommy Jordan have shown prom-ise and Kyle Koehne adds depth at tackle behind Nixon. 
Florida lost three big pieces from 
the line to the NFL Draft, includ-ing starters Marcus Gilbert and Mike Pouncey. But defensive tackle Jaye Howard said the offensive line would be tremendously improved this season, adding that he’s seen dramatic improvement in their tech-nique. 
“I can really tell a difference from 
last year,” Howard said. 
“Last year they couldn’t even 
block me, but now they’re giving me a little run for my money.”

� FLORIDA HAD ITS LOWEST SACK TOTAL 
SINCE 2002 LAST YEAR WITH JUST 21. 
TYLER JETT
Alligator Staff Writer
 
Last year, fans envisioned a dominant pass rush 
bolstered by a trio of blue-chip recruits. For one rea-son or another, those dreams simply didn’t material-ize. 
Dominique Easley, Sharrif Floyd and Ronald 
Powell were all ranked among the 
top-10 prospects in the nation by Rivals.com when they signed with the Gators in 2010, but the three combined for just one sack in their first year. Collectively, Florida’s pass rush registered the second-fewest sacks in the Southeastern Conference with 21, the fewest at 
UF since 2002.
The Gators are back in training camp, again. And, 
again, the expectations have been cranked up. The trio is more mature on the field, according to several teammates, and the team chemistry as a whole has improved.
But, like last season, it might be wise for fans to 
curb expectations.Gators seeking

Defensive end Sharrif Floyd and the rest of the front seven hope 
to improve upon 2010’s lackluster pass rush this season. 
“We need to play better up front,” 
coach Will Muschamp said after a 
team practice last week. “We’re not where we need to be, as far as our pad level, getting off blocks, shed-ding, making plays. I just feel like we can play better, can get more out of our players at that position.”
Muschamp, of course, brought a 
new defensive scheme to Gainesville when he came in December. He wants the Gators to run both 4-3 and 3-4 fronts this year, meaning the defensive linemen have to be com-fortable playing two different roles by the time the season starts against Florida Atlantic on Sept. 3.
Since the spring, much has been 
made about Powell’s role in the Buck, a hybrid position in which he plays end in 4-3 schemes and outside linebacker in the 3-4. Floyd has also had to make an adjustment, shifting to defensive end for the first time in his life.
Floyd said he and his fellow line-men have spent too much time dur -
ing scrimmages trying to understand all of their assignments instead of playing full speed and reacting to the offense.
“The main thing is we got to stop 
thinking,” he said.
Another issue for the group has 
been consistency, something that seems to be plaguing many under -
classmen at camp this month. Mus-champ pointed out that veteran 
players are generally bet-ter at playing through pain 
in the August heat.
Said junior middle linebacker Jon 
Bostic: “We just got to have guys coming out day after day with their assignments. We can’t come out one day, be a dominant pass rusher; the next day, not be a dominant pass rusher. We need the whole front seven up there — even the safeties coming on blitzes — everybody’s got to be able to get home.”

When asked which defensive back has given him 
the most trouble during fall camp, quarterback John Brantley couldn’t give a name.
All he could say was, “That new freshman, No. 
5.”
That freshman is cornerback Marcus Roberson, and 
according to coach Will Muschamp, there’s a chance he will see the field for the Gators sooner rather than later.
“He could possibly start,” Muschamp said. “We’re 
going to play the best players. I don’t care what grade they are, where they’re from — it don’t matter to me. … If they’re freshmen, it don’t matter to me.”
According to Muschamp, Roberson has been mak-
ing a variety of plays and tackles in space in the early goings of practice that could earn him immediate playing time when the season opens Sept. 3 against Florida Atlantic.
After losing shutdown corner Janoris Jenkins, who 
was dismissed from the team following his second marijuana-related arrest in three months, the Gators are left with an inexperienced group of corners.

Cooped up in a hospital bed in late 
July, about a week away from training camp, punter David Lerner answered his phone. It was Will Muschamp.
“How you feeling?” Muschamp 
asked.
“Well, my insides feel terrible,” 
Lerner said, “but my leg still works. I can promise you that.”
Lerner had just been diagnosed with 
Crohn’s disease, an inflammatory bow-el condition that can lead to abdominal pain, diarrhea and malnutrition. He lost 15 pounds as a result; still, when it came time to practice, Lerner was on the field, competing with freshman Kyle Christy for a starting position.
“There has never been a time in my 
life where I’ve been more happy to go to practice and be around the guys,” Lerner said Thursday. “Even just to get screamed at, it’s so much better than sitting in a hospital. It’s really made me realize that we take a lot of stuff for granted. Just eating solid food is like a blessing.” 
Lerner started feeling pain in his 
stomach on July 22. He lost his appetite, and team trainers took him to a doctor. Even though former teammate Carl Johnson also battled Crohn’s, Lerner did not know anything about the dis-ease. He was only aware of the illness because he had seen educational com-mercials on TV .
He is on medication and will re-
ceive a couple hours of IV treatment every two months, and team nutrition-ists have helped him create a safe diet. Whole wheat is the only type of food he has struggled with since the diagnosis.
During his hospital stint, Lerner re-
ceived supportive text messages from teammates, but it was Muschamp’s call that encouraged him the most.
“I was definitely depressed with everything that was going on, and that kind of gave me some hope,” he said. “(Muschamp) told me, ‘We care about you; anything you need, we’ll get it for you.’ That was really helpful.”
Lerner, a redshirt junior, has not 
seen game action in his three seasons but was one of four Gators walk-ons to receive a scholarship last week. He has spent his college career behind Chas Henry, the 2010 Ray Guy Award win-ner and All-American. 
But now Henry is gone, giving Lern-
er his best chance to crack the starting lineup. To do so, he will have to beat out Christy , a three-star recruit from Brownsburg (Ind.) High. 
Lerner said he takes more breaks 
than usual during practices, though mostly only after a coach’s suggestion.
“There are some days I just don’t 
have as much energy as I normally would,” he said. “That causes me to struggle a little bit. But, for the most part, I feel good enough to practice.”
Extra water breaks or not, Mus-
champ said he has been impressed with Lerner’s determination to get back on the field. Many people with the disease are barely able to leave their homes, ac-cording to the Mayo Clinic.
“The true test of someone is shown 
through adversity , and he’s going through a tough time,” Muschamp said. “He has not complained or any-thing. … Certainly, he’s an inspiration to me.
“Tough times don’t last. Tough peo-
ple do. And he’s a tough young man.”

The loss still lingers in their heads every day. Whether it’s on 
the court or in the weight room, there is no shortage of reminders. 
“It was a big letdown in a way,” senior defensive specialist 
Elissa Hausmann said. “Coming off that loss, we’re really fired up 
right now.”
In December, on a Friday night in Austin, Texas, the nation’s 
No. 1-seeded Florida volleyball team fell to 16th-seeded Purdue in straight sets. The NCAA Regional Semifinal loss ended what could have easily been the most successful season in school history.
Florida carried a 29-1 record and a 24-match winning streak 
into the loss to the Boilermakers. 
“I thought about it a lot,” senior setter/right-side hitter Kelly 
Murphy said. “It’s just hard to explain one thing that happened. It seemed like things started piling up on top of the other and it was just everything that could have gone wrong went wrong.”
More than eight months later, all the Gators can do is use the 
disappointing finish as a turning point as they move forward. Coach Mary Wise wasted little time forcing the match on her team, setting up a January meeting in 
which the team could re-watch its loss and reflect on it. 
“We knew we had some weaknesses, and we were trying to get 
better,” she said. “We just didn’t have enough time. The personnel wasn’t such to where we could hide it all. We could have played the match of our lives, and Purdue still could have won it and we still would have been disappointed.”
Hausmann said she was constantly reminded of the loss by 
strength and conditioning coaches over the summer as a means of motivation.
“They’re always wanting to make sure that doesn’t happen 
again,” she said.
The Gators feel they have addressed the weaknesses that hurt 
them in 2010. Wise said the presence of redshirt freshman Taylor Unroe, who came into last season with a broken bone in her ankle, will help tighten up a libero position that was occupied by the more offensive-oriented Erin Fleming last season. 
“It stings a little bit, but it’s one of those things where you learn 
just as much from your failures as you do from your successes,” junior setter Sundai Weston said. “I think this team is better for having that loss.”44, ALLIGATOR §  MONDAY, AUGUST 22, 2011

Florida volleyball coach Mary 
Wise walked into her team’s prac-tice facility one day over the summer and saw an elaborate practice plan drawn out. Clueless to who may have crafted the lengthy workout, the veteran coach thought a local club team was really pushing itself.
“Somebody’s going to be in here 
for a while,” she thought.
Come to find out, the plans were 
actually Wise’s introduction to her newest leadership group, a five-deep senior class that is emphasiz-ing leading by example in lieu of last year’s more vocal veterans.
“That’s what our seniors did this 
summer,” Wise said. “Not only were they in here playing, but they were doing it in an organized practice setting that the seniors ran. We’ve never had that before.”
During media day Wednesday , 
every player talked specifically about the loss of outside hitter and vocal leader Callie Rivers, a player whose voice filled the gym on a dai-ly basis her senior year.
“Callie is irreplaceable,” junior 
Sundai Weston said. “She’s someone I’ll always admire for her leadership and what she brought to the table.”
In a way , Wise agreed. Florida’s 
longtime coach talked about her se-niors combining to fill the void left by the departure of Rivers’ vocally incessant nature. 
“It’d take a lot more than five [to 
replace Rivers],” she said. “What we ask of our seniors every year is that they provide the leadership.”
Wise and seniors Cassandra An-
derson and Elissa Hausmann all said outside hitter Kristy Jaeckel has developed into the most Rivers-like individual on the team. 
As Florida’s oldest player, team-
mates jokingly refer to Jaeckel as “Grandma” and said they are ex-cited to see the improvements she’s made in her game for this season.
“We’ve been so lucky to have all 
of us here all summer,” Jaeckel said. “We’ve really developed a chemis-try where we feel more comfortable holding each other accountable as a team.”
So while the O’Connell Center 
court may be a little quieter this year, nobody seems too worried.Jaeckel emerging as senior leader

Preseason All-SEC selection Kristy Jaeckel, a senior,  is being count-
ed on to fill a leadership role after the departure of Callie Rivers. 
Gators learn from 
disappointing finishtheir belts, making for steep competition in 
an unproven secondary.
  While Muschamp has said a series of com-
binations at corner have run with the ﬁ  rst-team defense, with the now-injured Jeremy Brown as the one constant, the other position has been up for grabs — and Roberson looks to be taking hold.
  The 6-foot, 184-pound freshman from Ft. 
Lauderdale St. Thomas Aquinas High was the marquee name on defense among the Gators’ 2011 recruiting haul that included six defensive backs.
  Roberson, an Under Armour All-America 
selection as a high school senior, was a sur-prise addition for Florida on National Sign-ing Day in February, choosing the Gators after he was orally committed to both Texas Tech and Auburn in the weeks leading up to his decision.
  But since arriving on campus in May, 
Roberson has impressed his teammates, even during offseason workouts before the team was in pads. 
  “It seems like he already knows the 
game, he already understands splits and he has great feet, great hips,” safety Josh Shaw said. 
“He’s going to be a great player for us.”  Shaw wasn’t the only returning player to 
praise Roberson. 
He has also been lauded by safety Matt 
Elam and redshirt senior Moses Jenkins — who is competing with Roberson at corner-back.
  The common topics among all the acclaim 
from coaches and teammates have been Rob-erson’s instincts, technique and work ethic.
  While many members of last season’s 
highly touted freshman class came to UF with a sense of entitlement, there has been none of that from Roberson and his fellow freshmen.
  “They all came in with the same chip on 
their shoulder, they want to learn, they want to work,” Jenkins said.
  Since the Gators opened fall camp, 
Roberson has turned that chip into an oppor-tunity to make an impact in his ﬁ  rst year in Gainesville. 
  “He is a playmaker,” Shaw said. “He just 
does everything right — he’s a technician, that’s what I would say about him.”

Riding Clean: Doping inspires former Team Florida member

A UF grad and pro cyclist with Kenda/5-Hour Energy, Phil Gaimon decided to ink his 
beliefs into his arm, showing competitors his allegiance to being a drug-free rider.  JOHN BOOTHE
Alligator Writer
 
The story of how Phil Gaimon got a tattoo 
of a big, blue bar of soap on his right bicep starts like most late-night adventures — with a bad decision. 
In mid-September of last year, the 25-year-
old professional cyclist finished his first US-PRO Road Race National Championship in Greenville, S.C., with new team Kenda/5-Hour Energy.
After almost five hours in the saddle, Gai-
mon landed in a distant 34th-place finish be-hind other top Americans like Levi Leipheim-er, George Hincapie and Chris Horner. The race was far from his finest performance of the season, but that wasn’t what ultimately drove him to a local tattoo parlor the next night.
Just two days prior, news hit the Internet 
that longtime friend Jon Chodroff had ad-mitted to the purchase and use of the perfor -
mance-enhancing drug EPO.  
EPO, or erythropoietin, allows more oxy-
gen to be carried in the blood stream.
Then in his second year of racing since 
graduating from the University of Florida, Gaimon knew it was only a matter of time before he was confronted with the reality of cheating in his sport. 
But this was someone he was close to, a 
former teammate with Jelly Belly Pro Cycling. The truth stung even deeper when Chodroff, 25, was levied a two-year suspension by U.S. cycling’s governing body and immediately re-tired from the sport.
Gaimon couldn’t let the same thing hap-
pen to him. Chodroff was a good guy and a great friend. If he doped, it could happen to anyone.
“Right now, I think I’d never want to dope 
but what if I made it to Europe? What if some-thing tries to change my mind?” Gaimon asked himself.
So along with teammate Nick Waite, he 
walked into the Tattoo Wearhouse in nearby Spartanburg and asked for a simple design he’d been working up the courage to get since January, when a doctor asked if he was dop-ing.
In big, bold letters inside the outline of a 
still-sudsy bar of soap sits the word “CLEAN” for the entire cycling world to see.
Today , Gaimon — along with Waite and 
former pro Adam Myerson — continues to try and make a positive impact on his sport’s  MONDAY, AUGUST 22, 2011 § ALLIGATOR, 47
Gaimon: Cheating, doping could lead to demise of pro cycling
doping problem by running a donation-based website called 
CleanAthletes.com. The non-profit site helps raise money to buy young, up-and-coming cyclists the same “CLEAN” tattoo the three of them now have.
“If one of them gets it, then this kid will never dope, because 
the rule is if you get the tattoo and you dope, then we come scrape it off you,” Gaimon said.
Since the site started in October 2010, and through Gaimon’s 
promotion on his blog for the cycling magazine V eloNews, he said at least five other riders have gotten the same ink.
But his current teammate at Kenda/5-Hour Energy and for -
mer UF cycling club member, Bobby Sweeting, 24, was initially surprised on just how far his friend took the message.
“I was shocked that he did that,” Sweeting said. “I didn’t 
really think of him as the kind of guy who’d go and get tatted up. … I love to talk about it on my website and on social media, with the fans and stuff like that, but a tattoo is a little much, man.”
§ § §
Long before he was a crusading anti-doper and cycling pro, 
Gaimon was a self-described fat kid who played way too many video games and weighed 185 pounds his junior year of high school.
Unlike other racers like Sweeting, who were either running 
track or on the bike at an early age, Gaimon didn’t grow up as an athlete. The only sport he had ever played up to high school was a year of soccer — as a goalie.
It wasn’t until he came to UF and started to train on his first 
road bike that he finally lost weight and got into shape. When he started racing competitively with Team Florida, Gaimon quickly found he was a natural.
“Phil is an anomaly for sure,” Sweeting said. “He went from 
sitting on his ass to a [Category] 1 racer in like a year, which is pretty unheard of.”
In exactly 11 months, Gaimon rose from a beginner Catego-
ry 5 cyclist to a certified professional, the fastest upgrade of any domestic rider since the system was established. 
He signed his first major pro contract in 2009 with Jelly 
Belly.
“He progressed physically really well, but he’s also a stu-
dent of the sport unlike other people who just race,” said David Reich, who is a current member of Team Florida. “He is really interested in learning everything about it. He loves the sport, absolutely loves it at every level.”
At 6-foot-1 and now a mere 148 pounds, Gaimon also defied 
the odds by becoming a climbing specialist in the mountains for his new team, even though he began his career training on Florida’s flat terrain.In three years as a pro he’s notched 30 stage, jersey com-
petition and overall race wins while competing in some of the top domestic races each year like the Tour of California and the Tour of the Gila.
“It’s true there’s no climbing in Florida, there’s no altitude, 
but they have great weather,” Gaimon said. “So I have the ad-vantage that I don’t get snowed in for two weeks in January like the guys in Colorado. But people still ask me how I can climb that well coming from Florida. I tell them I train on Space Mountain. That usually works.”
§ § §
Now on his sixth post-collegiate team and with a new con-
tract extension through 2012, Gaimon wants to make the jump into bigger stage races internationally . 
With Kenda/5-Hour Energy expanding into a competitive 
team in Europe within the next five years, Gaimon will need strong results to remain a part of the growing program.
“My mom still thinks it’s a phase or something,” Gaimon 
said. “And she might be right, if I don’t get a good offer in a year or two, I could easily be in grad school. Until you’re at a certain level, that’s the only responsible way to look at it.”
In the past, most fledgling or insecure riders were able to ad-
vance or just stay afloat in cycling through rampant cheating.
Along with EPO, athletes use human growth hormones 
(HGH), amphetamines, steroids and even wholesale blood transfusions to gain a competitive advantage. 
“If one out of 10,000 racers dopes, he’s going to rise to the 
top because it works so well for cycling,” Gaimon said. “So it kind of attracts the garbage and you end up hearing about those guys a few years later when they get caught.” 
But the systemic doping has ultimately backfired financially 
for cyclists. During their young careers, Gaimon and Sweeting have both noticed a trend of wealthy, non-industry corpora-tions backing out of their sponsorships.
The scandals of the last 10 years surrounding Floyd Landis, 
Operation Puerto and multiple Grand Tour champions Alberto Contador and Lance Armstrong, have in the words of Gaimon, “drug sponsors’ names through the dirt,” leaving lesser-fund-ed cycling companies’ sponsors to pick up the slack. 
If the trend continues, he believes the sport could collapse.“It used to be you’d meet someone 10 years ago and you’d 
say you’re a pro cyclist and it’d be ‘Oh that’s cool,’” Gaimon said. “Now you meet someone and they look at you kind of weird because they watched 60 Minutes. They just assume.”
§ § §
Currently living in Ellicott City, Md., and traveling around 
the country for races, Gaimon looks to athletes from other sports that have survived and moved past a cheating culture.“I’ve met the gold medalist for the Nordic combined in the 
last Winter Olympics. He (Bill Demong) rides bikes, too, and you ask him about doping in skiing and he says there isn’t any-body . Nobody does it anymore,” he said. “The only reason he doesn’t have to consider it is because he doesn’t have to, no-body dopes.”
Though Gaimon believes science and desperate riders will 
always try to push what is fair and legal in the sport, he said he has noticed the doping problem, at least domestically, is im-proving simply because he is able to stay competitive in the races he enters.
Like Sweeting, most young cyclists from Gaimon’s genera-
tion respect and understand the point he’s trying to make with his “CLEAN” tattoo. While some of the older breed of riders might not like it, for most, it’s a reminder of the commitment they’ve made to improve their own abilities through honor -
able, hard work.
In the end, Gaimon doesn’t think all dopers are bad people 
for one lapse in judgment. Some of them were and still are his friends. And when he’s honest with himself, he still isn’t 100 percent sure of his own resolve until the day comes that it’s actually tested. 
He just wants to hold onto the only sport he’s ever loved for 
as long as he can.CYCLING , from page 46
