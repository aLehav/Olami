THE SUMMIT WILL BRING INDIGENOUS 
LEADERS, SCHOLARS TO NYC 
THIS OCTOBER
By Hope Dean
Alligator Staff Writer
When UF anthropology professor Michael Hecken-
berger worked in the Brazilian Amazon rainforest, the 
sky wasn’t always blue. 
During his stay in the early 2000s, Heckenberger 
woke up in an indigenous chief’s wooden house, slid 
out of his hammock and stepped across the dirt ﬂ  oor 
into the village. It was set in a circular clearing dotted 
with other houses and surrounded by thick green trees. 
But the air choked with gray smoke, scratched at his 
throat, and the sky was red from the ﬁ  res raging in the 
forest next door.
In 2019, ﬁ  res are still burning — and it’s only get-
ting worse. 
Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research report-
ed that satellites spotted almost 40,000 ﬁ  res in the Ama-zon this year, which is 77 percent more than in 2018. 
Heckenberger spent 27 years documenting the in-
digenous Kuikuro people, a group of about 500 people 
living near the Amazon’s Xingu River. He said the tribe 
and the rainforest it calls home are under attack from 
the recent increase in ﬁ  res.
“Ground Zero are the indigenous people that I work 
with,” Heckenberger said. “Their livelihoods will be 
destroyed.” 
This is why Heckenberger had the idea to create 
Amazon Hope, an event scheduled for Oct. 9 to 11 in 
New York City where indigenous tribe leaders, univer-
sity scholars and scientists will meet to brainstorm so-
lutions and spread awareness about the Amazon ﬁ  res. 
And it’s not just about Brazil — if the Amazon contin-
ues to burn, the global climate will suffer. 
Hack, slash and burn: the Amazon’s history of 
deforestation and ﬁ  res
Fires aren’t new to the Amazon. What’s new is the 
skyrocketing number of them, said Maíra Irigaray, a UF 
geography doctoral student who’s worked for activist 
groups in Brazil since she was 13.BUT WHERE IT WILL 
MAKE LANDFALL IS STILL 
UNKNOWN

Gainesville residents are pre-
paring for a hurricane that might 
not come toward them.
Hurricane Dorian is about 
1,100 miles from Gainesville with 
sustained winds of 105 mph which 
are expected to increase, accord-
ing to the National Weather Ser-
vice in Jacksonville. 
As of Thursday night, Dorian 
upgraded to a Category 2 and has 
shifted south. The storm is expect-
ed to make landfall as a Category 
4  hurricane with sustained winds 
of 139 mph, only 17 mph shy of a 
Category 5.
In a tweet shared Thursday, 
Mayor Lauren Poe announced he 
signed a declaration of emergency 
for the City of Gainesville until 
Sept. 4. 
So far, UF and Alachua Coun-
ty Public Schools have not an-
nounced any cancelation of class-
es. Other universities, however, 
such as the University of Central 
Florida, University of North Flor-ida and Florida International Uni-
versity have canceled classes. 
Although it is unclear where 
Dorian will land in Florida, Gov. 
Ron DeSantis urged residents to 
stock up on a week’s worth of sup-
plies in an announcement at the 
National Hurricane Center.
“You should have seven days 
worth of food and medicine and 
water as part of the plan,” DeSan-
tis said. 
Preparation for Dorian’s arrival 
has led to long lines in Gainesville 
stores and gas stations. 
While the aisles of the Walmart 
on SW 42nd Street were ﬁ  lled with 
people Thursday afternoon, the 
shelves were nearly empty.
By 1:30 p.m., the  Walmart al-
ready sold out of bottled water, 
said employee Kyara Worthy. 
“There is no water on the 
shelves,” Worthy said. “There is 
no water and people are freaking 
out.” 
The National Hurricane Center 
will announce their next update on 
Hurricane Dorian at 5 a.m. AST.

mhernandez16@gmail.comHE IS BEING HELD IN THE 
ALACHUA COUNTY JAIL 
ON A $125,000 BOND
By Dana Cassidy
Alligator Staff Writer
A UF resident assistant was ar-
rested Wednesday night after a fe-
male student told police he tried to 
sexually batter her.
Ian Milaski, a 21-year-old UF eco-
nomics senior, is accused of repeat-
edly asking the woman to have sex, 
forcefully grabbing her and trying 
“to ﬁ  nger her,” according to a Uni-
versity Police arrest report. Hours 
later, Milaski went to her dorm and 
tried lying next to her again until an-
other person stopped him.
Milaski is being held at the 
Alachua County Jail in lieu of a 
$125,000 bond on charges of false 
imprisonment and battery as of Thursday evening, according to 
county records.
Milaski was conﬁ  rmed to be a 
resident assistant and a UF student 
by UF spokesperson Steve Orlando. 
The incident was reported to 
UPD Wednesday night, Orlando 
said. An investigation started im-
mediately and led to Milaski’s arrest 
prior to midnight.
The woman told police Wednes-
day night the incident began when 
Milaski called her just before 2 a.m. 
Sunday morning saying he was 
drunk and needed help, according 
to the arrest report. When she ar-
rived at his room in Weaver Hall 
with water, which he asked her to 
bring, Milaski tried to “make out” 
with her.
The victim yelled “no” but Milas-
ki continued, police wrote. She said 
Milaski then grabbed her wrist and 
told her, “I want to sleep with you,” and repeatedly 
told her this de-
spite the victim 
asking him to let 
her leave.
Police said 
she told them 
she lied about 
needing to get 
her keys from 
the hallway in order to leave but Mi-
laski picked her up and put her on 
the bed when she approached the 
door, according to the arrest report.
She told police he placed him-
self on top of her and tried to non-
consensually “ﬁ  nger her” beneath 
her underwear, according to the 
arrest report. The victim told police 
she was able to free herself at some 
point and ran out of the room ter-
riﬁ  ed.

“I see a lot of people 
that have been very out-
raged with the news,” 
Irigaray said. “But it’s 
not news for us. Those 
ﬁ  res have always hap-
pened in the Amazon 
every year.”
Irigaray was the Bra-
zil program coordinator 
for Amazon Watch, a 
nonproﬁ  t that protects 
the Amazon and its peo-
ple. It wasn’t an easy job 
— for months, she re-
ceived death threats and 
only slept for three hours 
a night. She watched vil-
lagers fall into depres-
sion after they lost their 
homes to ﬁ  re. 
The burns are man-
made because ﬁ  re is an 
agricultural tool in Bra-
zil, said UF professor 
for the Center for Latin 
American Studies Robert 
Walker, who has been-
studying Amazon defor-
estation for 25 years. 
Walker said after de-
foresters cut down trees, 
they burn the land to 
choke out invasive plant 
species, use the ashes 
as fertilizer and utilize 
cleared land for farming 
and building.
However, when the 
forest burns repeatedly, 
seeds die and plants can 
no longer grow. With the 
trees gone, the land loses 
protection from evapora-
tion, leaving the forest 
even drier than before.
If the Amazon col-
lapses and can no lon-
ger recycle water, it will 
affect the entire world, 
Walker said. Droughts 
could settle into the 
Mississippi Valley, and 
change rainfall patterns 
in Israel, Argentina and 
drier parts of Brazil.
Brazil’s govern-
ment, knowing the en-
vironmental detriments, implemented a series of 
restrictions on deforesta-
tion in the early 2000s. 
But Brazilian President 
Jair Bolsonaro came into 
ofﬁ  ce this January with 
a pro-deforestation agen-
da, and the ﬁ  res have 
been increasing ever 
since, Walker said. 
About 20 percent of 
the Amazon has already 
been burned down. The 
entire Amazon is about 
half as big as the con-
tinental U.S., with the 
burned portion the size 
of Texas, Walker said. 
“If nothing is done, 
there’s no doubt in my 
mind that within the 
next decade, the forest 
will be pushed to one of 
these precipitate points,” 
Walker said. “It’s in a 
critical state, and it’s just 
going to get more critical. 
There’s a good chance 
that in [our] lifetime the 
forest will be gone.”
Planning for the fu-
ture: Amazon Hope 
Ana Cavalcante, a 
19-year-old UF political 
science sophomore and 
Brazilian Student Orga-
nization member, said 
the Amazon is burning 
in all directions — in-
cluding her mother’s 
hometown of Porto Vel-
ho, Rondônia.
Cavalcante lived in 
Brazil until she was 7 
years old, and spent 
two of those years in 
Porto Velho with her 
grandparents. They still 
live there, and recently 
haven’t brought good 
news during phone calls. 
“They say that you 
wake up in the morning, 
and there’s this thick 
thing in the air. And you 
think it might be sleet 
or fog, but once you see 
it, it’s actually smoke,” 
Cavalcante said. “It’s ev-erywhere.”
She said that Rondô-
nia has some of the 
most concentrated ﬁ  res 
in Brazil, but nobody is 
dedicating enough re-
sources to stop it despite 
the preservation of other 
global treasures. 
“We have the in-
stance of Notre Dame. 
That burned, and that 
got international atten-
tion, and people were 
sending millions of dol-
lars to reconstruct it,” 
Cavalcante said.  “But 
the Amazon, you can’t 
really reconstruct it — at 
least in our lifetime.” 
Cavalcante isn’t the 
only person holding 
onto hope for the forest, 
which is why Hecken-
berger decided to host 
the pro-environment 
summit ‘Amazon Hope’ 
later this fall in New 
York. 
More than 50 people 
were hand-picked to 
attend the summit, in-
cluding indigenous tribe 
leaders and pro-environ-
ment organizations from 
around the world such 
as Instituto Socioambi-
ental, the Environmental 
Defense Fund, People’s 
Palace Projects and the 
University of São Paulo, 
said Elizabeth Subin, the 
director of Vermont’s 
Pennywise Foundation, 
one of the event spon-
sors.
Participants will gath-
er at Afﬁ  rmation Arts in 
New York City to brain-
storm ideas to reduce 
ﬁ  res. The goal is to leave 
the event with a tangible 
to-do list, but they also 
want to raise awareness 
of the situation.
Pennywise Founda-
tion, a humanitarian 
organization, has been 
working with Hecken-
berger for two years on 
a project called ‘Ipatse 
Futures’ to sustain Ipa-tse, a Kuikuro village, 
through environmental 
protection and economic 
opportunity, Subin said. 
Afﬁ  rmation Arts, the 
other event sponsor, will 
host an exhibit focused 
entirely on the Amazon 
that will include indig-
enous artwork, photo-
graphs of Kuikuro vil-
lages and people, a ﬁ  lm 
made by Kuikuro people 
about climate change 
and more, Subin said. 
Heckenberger ulti-
mately wants Amazon 
Hope to be focused 
on the Kuikuro. The 
non-Kuikuro people at-
tending the summit are 
“backup singers,” while 
the indigenous people 
are “headliners” and the 
summit a stage for them 
to tell their story. 
He recalled his early 
days with Kuikuro peo-
ple, when the skies were 
red and he dug through 
the land to help preserve 
their history. Now, in 
his UF ofﬁ  ce between 
packed bookshelves and 
photos of him with Kui-
kuro people, he’s hoping 
his plans will help save 
them and the environ-
ment. 
“It’s an area that 
some people have al-
most given up on,” 
Heckenberger said. “But 
again, that’s my family. 
I’ve lived [with Kuikuro 
people] for so long, and 
we’re so close, I consider 
them family, not re-
search objects. And I’m 
not willing to give up the 
ship. There is still hope.”

UNSURE HOW TO 
PREPARE? 
WE GOT YOU COVERED
By Ana Escalante
Alligator Staff Writer
A lifetime in Moscow hasn’t pre-
pared Masha Ovespyan for Florida’s 
unpredictable hurricane season.
A week after returning to 
Gainesville as a Russian internation-
al student, Ovespyan, a 20-year-old 
UF political science sophomore, is 
facing her ﬁ  rst major hurricane.
Hurricane Dorian is projected to 
hit Florida as a Category 4 storm as 
it increases in intensity and hits the 
east coast this weekend. 
Wednesday night, Gov. Ron De-
Santis declared a state of emergency 
in anticipation of Dorian’s landfall. 
As of Thursday night, it is unclear 
where in Florida Dorian will make a 
direct hit.
“I don’t know what I should be 
doing,” she said. “Well, at least I 
have enough food and entertainment 
to not leave my apartment for some 
time.”While Florida natives tend to 
make memes about hurricanes this 
time of year, some international and 
out-of-state students who have never 
experienced such a strong storm are 
at a loss on how to prepare.
“This might sound weird, but a 
part of me is actually curious about 
how everything is going to be man-
aged at UF,” she said. “What are the 
rules, procedures, what [are] people 
supposed to do to stay safe?” 
For those wondering the same, 
here are some recommendations on 
what you can do to prepare for Hur-
ricane Dorian. 
1. Prepare a storm supply 
kit.
UF Emergency Management rec-
ommends having a disaster kit of 
supplies that will last you at least 72 
hours, said UF spokesperson Steve 
Orlando. Students should have es-
sentials like water, medicine, a por-
table charger, extra batteries, a ﬂ  ash-
light, candles and non-perishable 
food handy. 
2. Stay indoors and away from windows. 
Students are strongly recom-
mended to stay away from doors 
and windows if winds get too strong, 
according to the UF Emergency 
Management Gator Safe Hurricane 
Brochure. If students can’t stay in a 
room without windows, they are en-
couraged to seek shelter in a closet, 
hallway or a bathtub. 
3. Turn off electronics.
Losing power is always a possi-
bility in storms of this size. The UF 
Emergency Management hurricane 
brochure recommends unplugging 
big electronics for safety. If not done, 
devices could short-circuit and com-
pletely shut off. 
4. Save your ride. 
Park cars and scooters on high 
ground if they are parked in areas 
that ﬂ  ood easily. Bring bikes inside 
of homes to prevent damage from 
debris. Students with cars and scoot-
ers should also park their vehicles in 
a garage to prevent them from get-ting hit by tree branches. 
Students waiting for class to be 
canceled should hear an announce-
ment today, Orlando said. On cam-
pus groups, Emergency Manage-ment and ofﬁ  cials are meeting to 
discuss the possibility.

Students looking to work in UF 
Student Government now have 
three party options to get involved 
with.
Six minutes before the ﬁ  rst SG 
Senate meeting Tuesday night, 
former Impact pro-tempore and independent senator Emily Dun-
son sent The Alligator a Letter 
to the Editor announcing Gator 
Party and herself as its president. 
Former Impact Party Senator and 
Gator Party spokesperson Wynton 
White announced the “Gator Co-
alition” during the Senate meet-
ing. 
Since then, a Gator Party Face-
book page has been made and

The group began to slate, or 
interview, for Senate seats with 
the party on Thursday, with in-terviews continuing today and 
Tuesday. Impact Party and Inspire 
Party are also slating. 
Gator Party aims to unite 
and empower the student body 
through its varied interests, the 
party wrote in an email to The Al-
ligator. It is unclear which Gator 
Party member responded to ques-
tions because the email was sent 
by a generic Gator Party account.
“Our goal is for our actions to-
day to positively affect generations 
of Gators to come,” the email read. 
The Alligator asked Gator Party 
how the new party came to be, what the party’s policy goals are 
and who’s involved in the group. 
The email in response didn’t an-
swer speciﬁ  c questions.
When asked the difference 
between a coalition and party, 
the representatives attached the 
SG Rules and Procedures, which 
doesn’t clearly indicate the differ-
ence.
Cody Paddack, an 18-year-old 
UF exploratory freshman, inter-
viewed with Gator Party on Thurs-
day. She said she recently joined 
a sorority and wants to become 
a senator to be more involved on campus and learn more about the 
political process at UF.
“I do think it’s nice to be with 
other people who promote the 
same communities as I do and un-
derstand more of how that com-
munity works,” she said.

THE NEW INSTITUTES WILL 
DEBUT NOV . 16 AND 17
By Lina Ruiz
Alligator Staff Writer
In 2017, two wood-frame hous-
es on University Avenue meant to 
provide comfort and community to 
Latinx and black UF students were 
torn down. 
In November, students can return 
to the buildings on 1510 and 1504 
W. University Ave.
After two years of debates and 
construction redesigns, the Institute 
of Black Culture and the Institute 
of Hispanic-Latino Cultures, better 
known as La Casita, will open with 
ribbon-cutting ceremonies on Nov. 
16 and 17, respectively. 
The announcement was made 
Wednesday night during the His-
panic-Latinx Student Assembly, an 
annual event welcoming Latinx stu-
dents to UF. 
Will Atkins, the director of Mul-
ticultural and Diversity Affairs, said 
MCDA will lead the ceremonies.
“It’s going to definitely provide a 
space for students to come together around academic success, personal 
[and] professional development, as 
well as community building and cul-
tural celebration,” Atkins said. 
Construction cost $9.9 million, 
which was funded by the UF Capi-
tal Investment Trust Fund, Atkins 
said. Bianca Quiñones, the director 
of Hispanic-Latino Affairs, and Carl 
Simien, the director of Black Affairs, 
will manage their respective insti-
tutes. 
Hispanic Student Association 
President Isabella Oliver said more 
details of the ribbon-cutting ceremo-
nies will be released closer to the 
opening dates. There will be a series 
of events the week of the debut. 
Oliver, a 21-year-old UF interna-
tional studies senior, never visited 
the old La Casita because she learned 
about it while it was closing. Oliver 
said she is excited about how the 
space will cater to Latinx students.
“I think having La Casita again 
is going to be one of the best things 
to happen to our community,” she 
said. “I think it’s going to be a glim-
mer of hope.”
At the student assembly, the 
trailer for “A Tale of Two Houses,” 
a documentary about the student protests to keep the two buildings in-
dependent and the history of both in-
stitutes was also shown. HSA mem-
ber Kendra Blandon, a 21-year-old 
UF religion and international studies 
senior, announced the documentary, 
which was created through the Sam-
uel Proctor Oral History Program. 
Blandon said she hopes the docu-
mentary empowers Hispanic and Af-
rican American communities.
“I had no idea that two small 
buildings north of University [Av-
enue] could have such a rich history 
of student activism, of involvement 
and, frankly, of politics as well,” 
Blandon said.
The buildings were 90 years old 
when they were demolished to be 
reconstructed due to mold, termites 
and structural damage, according to 
Alligator archives. Construction was 
supposed to begin in January 2017 to 
be completed by that Fall. 
However, things didn’t go as 
planned. In Summer 2017, when 
MCDA  presented a proposal to com-
bine the institutes into one U-shaped 
building, many students protested. 
The students argued that the build-
ings should remain separate because 
each institute had its own unique his-tory. MCDA eventually abandoned 
the U-shaped idea and announced 
the buildings would remain separate 
in July 2017. 
“Things are not given, but earned 
at the University of Florida,” Bland-
on said on stage at the assembly. 
“Students at this university fought 
for these spaces. They’re ours, and we’re going to keep it that way.”

THE VICTIM SUFFERED 
LACERATIONS 
By Alex DeLuca
Alligator Staff Writer
New details have surfaced about 
the fatal attack in Alachua County 
earlier this year from what ornitholo-
gists describe as “the world’s most 
dangerous bird.”
More than four months after an 
Alachua man was killed by a casso-
wary, an autopsy report has been re-
leased with new information regard-
ing the death. The report confirms 75-year-old Marvin Hajos’ death was 
caused by injuries sustained in the 
attack by the dinosaur-like flightless 
bird. 
This disproves earlier medical 
reports stating Hajos suffered from 
cardiac arrest due to lacerations and 
blood loss. 
In April, the death attracted in-
ternational attention, becoming the 
first confirmed human death by 
cassowary in 93 years, according to 
Guinness World Records. 
According to the autopsy report, 
which was performed less than 24 
hours after the attack on April 12 in Alachua, Hajos suffered deep talon 
scratches across his neck, face, back, 
abdomen, thighs, legs and right arm, 
including damage to his brachial ar-
tery. 
At the time of the accident, Ha-
jos was breeding a variety of exotic 
species on his farm in rural Alachua, 
many of them flightless birds, such 
as emus, ostriches, rheas and casso-
waries. 
Hajos was not required to have a 
permit to breed the birds. 
“If you are breeding the animals 
you do not have to have a permit. 
If you are exhibiting the animals or selling the animals, then you need 
a permit,” Florida Fish and Wildlife 
Conservation Commission spokes-
woman Karen Parker said. “Since 
he was a commercial breeder…  a 
permit for these animals was not re-
quired.”
Following the attack, the cas-
sowary was sold at the Gulf Coast 
Livestock Auction in Madison, Fla.
Cassowaries are native to the 
tropics of Australia and New Guinea. 
The FWC identifies the bird as “Class 
II Wildlife,” which can “pose a dan-
ger to people.” 
Ted Bridis, a UF journalism pro-fessor, made a public records request 
for the autopsy report almost imme-
diately after the incident in April. He 
said it took the medical examiner’s 
office four months to send him the 
report. 
“There were questions about his 
previous medical conditions and to 
what extent that might have played 
a role in his death,” Bridis said. “The 
autopsy was a way to answer those 
questions.”

Column
Unsolicited advice from a 1L survivor
Full disclosure: I pick my column topics 
based on how easy they are to write. 
A piece about my academic struggles? 
I can crank that out in an hour. Top-
ics about the law school culture at UF, 
a more in-depth think piece on some politi-
cal topic or (heaven forbid) a nuanced look 
at the student organization funding “crisis?” 
We’ll save those for a week when I’m not 
already procrastinating on my class assign-
ments.
As 1Ls (ﬁ  rst-year law students) are ﬁ  nishing their 
ﬁ  rst week of classes, I thought I’d write something law 
school speciﬁ  c.
So, here’s my wholly unsolicited advice for surviv-
ing the ﬁ  rst year of law school: Don’t let “perfect” be 
the enemy of “good enough,” and here’s my moderately 
cheesy story to go with it. 
As a law student, you’re going to be constantly sur-
rounded by examples of good legal writing. Most of the 
ﬁ  rst year is learning from appellate cases in the case 
book, and much of that is written by preeminent ju-
rists such as Justice Cardozo, Justice Holmes and Judge 
Posner. 
But when I sat down with my ﬁ  rst assignment for 
legal writing, I couldn’t turn the thoughts in my head 
into something that looked good on a page. I knew what 
I wanted to convey, I just couldn’t do it in a way that 
sounded anywhere near as good as the cases I had been reading for class. I spent way too much time 
poring over every word until I realized that I 
was being foolish and arrogant. Of course my 
writing wouldn’t sound as good as the cases 
I was reading in class. The whole point of 
law school is to take the ﬁ  rst steps along the 
path of learning how to hopefully, someday, 
maybe if I get lucky, craft good legal writing. 
I was holding myself to a standard that was 
far above anything I could reach and I was 
worse off because of it. I realized that I was 
failing to allow myself room to grow by expecting my-
self to be good at this the ﬁ  rst time I tried. I took a step 
back, realized that my writing was as good as it was 
going to get and submitted the assignment. 
Law school is highly competitive and the grading 
curve is evidence of humanity’s sadistic nature. But I’ve 
found that I’m a lot more content when I’m focused on 
competing with my past self instead of with the other 
students around me. That certainly doesn’t mean that 
I’ve ﬁ  gured out everything, or really much of anything 
about how to be a successful law school student. But 
I have ﬁ  gured out that pushing myself to be my best 
instead of competing against perfection makes me a lot 
less stressed and anxious.

“Yes, Mom. I am prepared for the hurricane. Yes. Uh-
huh. I have a full tank of gas. Yep.” You don’t actually 
know how much gas your car has, but you’re pretty 
sure it didn’t beep at you the last time you drove it. 
“I have plenty of non-perishable food. Lots of bottled wa-
ter and batteries.” Your lies continue, but now you’re hungry. 
“Mhmm. Yep.” 
You keep up the agreeable sounds while meandering into the 
kitchen you share with your roommate, Kathy. You open the cab-
inets, looking for a snack. “I don’t know if they’re going to cancel 
class, Mom. They haven’t announced anything yet.” 
Hmm... herbal tea, peanut butter and a partial bag of quinoa. 
You turn to the fridge. “No, I don’t think it would make sense to 
drive 4 hours just to sit inside waiting on a hurricane that may not 
even hit when I need to spend the weekend here, studying.” Your 
classmate, Tiffany, told you about a hurricane party on Saturday. 
Supposedly, some engineering juniors have rigged up a wind tun-
nel. “You know I can’t focus on schoolwork when I visit.” 
You frown in consternation at your fridge. Everything in the 
fridge has “KATHY” written on it. You don’t understand why 
she is so uptight. If you had known the cake was for her boy-
friend’s birthday you never would have eaten it. Or, at least, you 
wouldn’t have eaten all of it. “Look, Mom. I gotta go. I have my 
study group. Yep. Uh-huh. You too. Bye.” You close the fridge 
and hang up. Maybe your mom is right. It wouldn’t hurt to stop 
by the store and pick up a few necessities just in case, like a box 
of those pizza Cheez-Its Tiffany let you try that morning. Oh, 
and you should probably replace that bottle of Kathy’s wine you 
drank last night. And get one for yourself. 
You grab your keys and swing open the door. A piece of paper 
ﬂ  utters to the ﬂ  oor. Hoping it’s a coupon for take-out, because 
you are seriously up for devouring some General Tso’s, you pick 
it up. But it’s not a coupon at all. It reads.... 
DARTS AND LAURELS.
A laurel goes to Lizzo for her performance at the VMAs this 
week. More speciﬁ  cally, a laurel goes to Lizzo’s butt. On Mon-
day, Lizzo wowed the audience of MTV’s Video Music Awards 
when she shared the stage during her performance of “Truth 
Hurts” and “Good As Hell” with a giant, twerking inﬂ  atable boo-
ty. We wish we were 100 percent that b****.
A dart goes to all the people buying way too many cases of 
bottled water this weekend. Be honest with yourself, the only 
water you drink during a regular day is from a White Claw. It 
will take you until next hurricane season to drink that 24-pack, 
and until hurricane season of the year 2469 for the bottles to bio-
degrade. Opt for gallon jugs instead, ﬁ  ll large ziplock bags with 
water and freeze them. Or skip the plastic altogether and ﬁ  ll a 
few of the dozens of thermoses and water bottles sitting in your 
cupboard. Don’t waste whatever water is left over, but use it to 
water your plants, top off your Keurig’s reservoir or refresh your 
cat’s water bowl. Or you could, you know, drink it. 
A laurel goes to KFC for increasing their meatless options. 
KFC partnered with Beyond Meat to offer plant-based Beyond 
Fried Chicken at one of their Atlanta locations on Tuesday. The 
“chicken” was sold out within ﬁ  ve hours. We hope this apparent 
success will lead to KFC expanding the availability of the Beyond 
Fried Chicken nationwide. We aren’t about that Chick-ﬁ  l-A ver-
sus Popeyes drama.
Finally, to continue with what is becoming a series of teenag-
ers making us look bad, a laurel goes to Greta Thunberg. The 
16-year-old Swedish environmental activist chose to travel to the 
U.S. by zero carbon-emission sailboat instead of taking a con-
ventional plane, arriving in New York on Wednesday after a two 
week transatlantic journey. She opted for conscientiousness over 
convenience. We should keep her in mind the next time we’re 
tempted to drive across the parking lot to spare ourselves the 50-
foot walk from Pier 1 Imports to Trader Joe’s.

Letters to the Editor
Gator Party is Impact Party with a new 
name. If you read the Alligator or 
checked the Swampy UF memes for 
Top 10 public teen Facebook page on 
Wednesday, you probably heard that 
a “new” Student Government party was an-
nounced: Gator Party. But there’s really noth-
ing new here.
There’s a long history of the elite system 
in SG changing names when things get messy 
for them. In 2009, another Gator Party be-
came Unite Party. In 2012, Unite Party became 
Swamp Party. In 2015, Swamp Party became 
Impact Party. This week, Impact has become 
Gator Party.
It’s exceedingly clear that Gator Party is an 
attempt to deceive voters into thinking that there is something new and fresh about the 
majority party. Gator party’s leader, former 
Senate President Pro-Tempore Emily Dunson, 
ran and was elected with Impact three times. 
Dunson never spoke out against Impact and 
was content with supporting their corrupt be-
havior and misguided votes. 
Gator’s spokesperson, Wynton White, also 
ran with Impact Party and was afﬁ  liated with 
them until it became politically convenient 
to abandon his association with them. The 
Impact Party Majority Party Leader himself, 
Branden Pearson, also revealed himself to be 
a die-hard proponent of Gator Party, sharing 
their posts on Facebook and referring to their 
campaign as “our movement.”
Students deserve to know who is running to represent them and allocate $22 million in 
student fees. Gator Party is nothing new and 
implying otherwise is lying to the voters. It’s 
important to note that these ofﬁ  cials who lead 
Gator Party are the same ones who denied 
funding to countless student organizations 
over the past few weeks. Dunson served on 
the 800 Codes Ad-Hoc Senate Committee that 
approved the changes leading to recent bud-
get mismanagement and White served as vice 
chair of the Senate Budget and Appropriations 
Committee.
A quick glance at Gator’s Facebook page 
would make one think that they were actually 
looking at Impact’s page. The same people are 
commenting, sharing and liking the posts in 
the same robotic fashion. The leadership, the supporters and the corruption are the same. 
Gator Party is made up of the same group of 
people that voted against legislation to prevent 
sexual assault, voted to silence the voices of 
students at Senate meetings, illegally removed 
minority party senators and approved the ap-
pointments of vastly unqualiﬁ  ed students to 
the executive branch.
You deserve honesty and authenticity from 
the SG parties running to represent you. This 
week made it crystal clear that you won’t get 
that from Gator Party.
Emily Hyden is a UF international studies 
junior.
If there were a drug that could 
do for human health everything 
that exercise can, it would be 
the most valuable pharmaceuti-
cal ever developed. The problem 
comes from the idea that exercise 
must be taxing and time-consuming 
to be effective. I think most people 
would be surprised by just how 
beneﬁ  cial a few movements can be, 
both physically and mentally. The 
idea of using physical stress to relieve mental 
stress might be counterintuitive, but bear with 
me. If these exercises don’t ‘do it’ for you, that’s 
alright! I’d encourage everyone to search for 
their own healthy ways to combat stressors.
Believe it or not, deep breathing is a legiti-
mate exercise to reduce stress. Inhale slowly for 
about four seconds while pushing your stomach 
out. Hold your breath for a second, and then ex-
hale for seven seconds. Try to keep your mind 
focused on simple things: the feeling of the air 
or the surface you’re on. It’s easy to learn and 
can be done anywhere, so make use of it! 
Stretching and yoga are two great ways to 
address stress and its symptoms, like muscular 
tension. Some good starter movements include 
a standing hamstring stretch, piriformis stretch 
and lunge stretch. Try to hold each of these for a 
minute and make sure to do so on a soft surface. 
My personal favorite, running, is one of the 
best stress relievers. I know that many people  hate it, but you shouldn’t write it 
off. First, start by walking for ﬁ  ve 
minutes to warm up. Then, run for 
a minute and a half without stop-
ping. Next, give yourself a break by 
walking for another two minutes. 
Repeat these short bursts of run-
ning and walking every other day 
to build up your endurance. As you 
get comfortable, lengthen your run-
ning and shorten your walking. You 
can thank me when you get your ﬁ  rst runner’s 
high. 
I’m guessing this is where I’m going to lose 
most of you, but resistance exercises relieve 
stress and provide immense long-term beneﬁ  ts. 
These include squats, pushups, pull-ups, lung-
es, extended-arm planks and dips. Do as many 
as feels comfortable! And, if you aren’t able to 
do a single one, try doing negatives — that is, do 
the exercises backward and slowly. 
This semester, if you’re feeling over-
whelmed, take a few minutes and put some of 
these to practice! You might ﬁ  nd yourself pleas-
antly surprised. 
Matthew Diaz is the Vice President of the 
Volunteers for International Student AffairsThe UF campus is teem-
ing with opportunities. 
However, it can some-
times be a challenge to 
sort through them and 
ﬁ  nd ones that will help you 
learn practical skills, improve 
your community and become a 
better leader.
There are a few resources 
and opportunities that have made my time 
at UF more rewarding. These opportuni-
ties are not just for those studying politi-
cal science or related ﬁ  elds. Students of all 
backgrounds and academic pursuits ought 
to consider them.
This Fall, students have the opportunity 
to run for Student Government Senate in 
the upcoming SG elections on Sept. 24 and 
25. As I mentioned last week, the Senate 
controls a $22 million budget of student 
fees that is used to fund student organiza-
tions resources such as free printing and 
our campus ﬁ  tness centers. The Senate is 
composed of 100 senators — 50 are elected 
in the Fall based on housing area and 50 
are elected in the Spring based on academ-
ic classiﬁ  cation. To register to run, all you 
have to do is show up to the Reitz Union third ﬂ  oor (rooms 3305, 3310, 
3315 and 3320) on Aug. 29 from 
8 a.m. to 8 p.m., Aug. 30 from 8 
a.m. to 5 p.m., or Sept. 3 from 8 
a.m. to 5 p.m. with your Gator 1 
card to ﬁ  ll out some paperwork. 
Traditionally, those looking to 
run with a party will dress pro-
fessionally and participate in a 
short interview. Afterward, you 
will be notiﬁ  ed by the party if you are se-
lected. 
On March 17, 2020, Gainesville voters 
will elect three new city commissioners.  
Every election season, local commission 
candidates look for passionate, energetic 
volunteers who will knock on doors, phone 
bank, conduct research and perform other 
tasks that are critical to any political cam-
paign. To get involved, reach out to local 
candidates via email or social media to see 
how you can help them. You can ﬁ  nd out 
who is running by visiting the Alachua 
County Supervisor of Elections ofﬁ  ce web-
site at votealachua.com.

• The next time you get a chance, you 
might want to check the pressure of

wasted due to improper tire pressure, 
according to the Department of Energy.

• In all likelihood, you’ve never run 
across a moirologist — in fact, they 
probably don’t even exist in the Unit-
ed States today. However, professional 
mourners — which is what moirolo-
gists are — have a long history, dat-
ing back to ancient Greece. Even as 
recently as the early 1900s, there was a 
report of a moirologists’ strike in Paris.

and a new BMW with the license plate 
DEAD1. One week later, with Mezer 
behind the wheel, the car skidded around 
a curve at 100 mph, hit an embankment 
and was thrown 200 feet, landing on its 
roof in a field and killing Mezer.

Sports Writer
 
A bye week is long and tedious 
for college football fans. While Flor-
ida’s Week 0 battle with Miami on 
Aug. 24 was entertaining, it left a 
hole for the UF faithful this week 
while the rest of the country gets to 
watch their team play.
Here are five Saturday matchups 
for Florida fans to keep an eye on as 
previews for future games:
 
Toledo vs. Kentucky, Noon
While Kentucky is not UF’s next 
opponent, it will be Florida’s first 
conference matchup of the season. 
And it will be a big one.
Kentucky ended its 31-year los-
ing streak against Florida in 2018 
using running back Benny Snell 
Jr.’s 175 yards on the ground to 
pave the way for a 27-16 victory at 
The Swamp.
The Wildcats still pose a threat 
on offense, returning four starters 
from last year's 10-3 season, despite 
losing Snell Jr.
Junior wide receiver Lynn 
Bowden Jr. is expected to have 
a breakout season as Kentucky 
comes into 2019 looking to dupli-
cate last season’s success. Bowden 
Jr. led both teams in receiving as 
a sophomore against Florida with 
four catches for 79 yards and a 
touchdown.
Kentucky’s first test against To-
ledo should give Florida fans a good 
idea of what to expect for the Sept. 14 meet up between the two teams.
 
No. 3 Georgia vs. Vanderbilt, 
7:30 p.m.
While players and coaches 
should be taking it week by week, 
it’s never too early for fans to start 
looking ahead.
Florida and Georgia’s annual 
rendezvous in Jacksonville is still a 
long way off, but the Nov. 2 match-
up is anticipated to be momen-
tous given the possible conference 
championship implications.
The Gators are looking for their 
first win over the Bulldogs since 
2016, and this may be their best 
chance to do it. After a 42-7 shel-
lacking in 2017, Florida showed 
more promise in 2018, keeping it 
close for most of the game until its 
inability to pass the ball derailed a 
late surge.
With a ton of talent on both 
teams, both Georgia and Florida 
expect to front the SEC East in the 
yearly race to Atlanta for the SEC 
Championship.
UGA opening its season against 
an SEC opponent should offer 
meaningful insight into how the 
Gators could get over that hump.
 
Georgia Southern vs. No. 6 LSU, 
7:30 p.m.
Clashes between Florida and 
LSU always result in close, emo-
tional battles with crazy endings. 
The Gators shocked then-No. 5 LSU 
last year with a pick-six by safety 
Brad Stewart to thwart the Tigers’ shot at the College Football Playoff.
LSU’s revenge game in Baton 
Rouge is expected to be one of Flori-
da’s toughest matchups of the year. 
The two teams played back-to-back 
games in Gainesville due to a loca-
tion change in 2016 caused by Hur-
ricane Matthew, but this year the 
Gators head to Death Valley. The 
Tigers saw many talented defensive 
players leave for the draft, including 
corner Greedy Williams and line-
backer Devin White. Still, they’re 
strong contenders with a skillful 
offense led by quarterback Joe Bur-
row and a tough defense backed by 
safety Grant Delpit.
The Week 1 duel with Georgia 
Southern may tell the tale to come.
 
No. 16 Auburn vs. No. 11 Oregon, 
7:30
Amid Florida’s tough 2019 
schedule lies a strong opponent on 
the other side of the SEC.
Auburn enters the season with 
expectations higher than its rank 
suggests. AU’s senior-laden defen-
sive front is led by ends Nick Coe 
and Marlon Davidson and the Ti-
gers just need some semblance of 
an offense to be a top team this 
year.
It could also be a make-or-break 
year for Auburn coach Gus Mal-
zahn after a disappointing 8-5 sea-
son in 2018.
AU's clash with Oregon will be 
the only top-25 matchup in Week 1 Chris King / Alligator Staff
No. 3 Georgia opens its season with a conference matchup at Vanderbilt. The Bulldogs were the 
preseason favorite to win the SEC East and are a popular College Football Playoff pick.

Bye Week Blues: Games to watchStaff Report
Oh boy.
It’s that time again, guys 
and gals. It’s Week 1 of the 
college football season, and 
with that comes everyone’s 
least favorite annual tradition: the al-
ligatorSports picks column.
What horrible, atrocious, god-aw-
ful takes lie within? Only God knows.
And we know. But we decided to 
write them anyway.
The Gators have a bye this week 
after proving that you can indeed 
win a football game even if you don’t 
want to in their 24-20 victory over Mi-
ami on Saturday. But even with UF’s 
sabbatical, the picks column marches 
onward.
Before we meet this season’s pick-
ers, Dylan Rudolph and Sports Editor 
Tyler Nettuno give their predictions 
on Week 1’s most anticipated match-
up — the Eastern Michigan Eagles at 
the Coastal Carolina Chanticleers.
Eastern Michigan (-6) will win 
because…
 
The Eagles are a team on the rise. 
Coach Chris Creighton has turned 
around one of the worst football pro-
grams in the country since his arrival 
in 2014.
Though he went a combined 3-21 
in his first two years with the pro-
gram, he has begun to right the ship 
in recent years, going 19-19 the last 
three seasons with two wins against 
Power 5 teams (Rutgers and Purdue), 
and his team is primed for a breakout 
year.
This is going to be a team that 
leans on its offense, something new 
after losing seven starters on its reli-
able defense last year. It is going to 
wear down teams with its running 
game using senior running back Shaq 
Vann, who led the team in yards on 
the ground last year with 590 and tacked on five touchdowns.
Coastal Carolina, on the other 
hand, allowed opponents to run all 
over it in 2018. The Chanticleers per-
mitted the opposition 2933 rush yards 
last season, good for 10th worst in the 
country according to ESPN. CCU sim-
ply does not match up well with East-
ern Michigan, and the Chanticleers 
are going to move to Australia after 
being defeated by EMU.
— Dylan Rudolph
Coastal Carolina will win be-
cause…
It is, by my calculations, the only 
program in FBS history built by an 
executive of a Fortune 500 company.
Seriously, look it up.
Joe Moglia, who coached the 
Chanticleers from 2012 until his re-
tirement following last season, was 
the CEO of TD Ameritrade before 
becoming the head man in Conway, 
South Carolina.
Unfortunately for CCU, new coach 
Jamey Chadwell’s background is ex-
clusively in football. 
Still, Coastal improved from 3-9 in 
2017 to 5-7 last year in its first season 
as a full FBS member. Its conference, 
the Sun Belt, is top heavy. But Coastal 
Carolina could improve that record 
due to weak pieces at the bottom of 
the league.
Not convinced yet?
Its mascot — the Chanticleer — is 
a fabled rooster from Chaucer’s “The 
Canterbury Tales”. How dope is that?
CCU’s business acumen — paired 
with all the powers of a medieval 
chicken— will help it prevail on Sat-
urday.

Florida’s cross country team 
will be traveling to Jacksonville 
to compete in the University of North Florida Invitational on 
Friday at 8:30 a.m. to start its 
2019 campaign. The team has 
competed in the event each year 
since 2016. Here are some things 
to know going in: Florida’s mindset
This time last year, the Gators 
entered the UNF Invitational 
with much lower expectations. 
Assistant coach Chris Solinsky 
went as far as to say that the team’s mindset this season is on 
a “completely different level.” 
The third-year Florida coach 
attributed this to how much the 
team has improved since the last 
campaign.
“Down here in Florida, we 
build houses on a slab, so the 
bigger and thicker the slab, the 
more sturdy your foundation, so 
you can build a bigger and taller 
house,” Solinsky said. “So for 
us, on both sides, both men and 
women, we’ve built a pretty darn 
good slab over the summer.”
The women are coming off a 
season where they finished 16th at 
the 2018 NCAA Championships, 
while the men failed to qualify.
 
The Gators will be without 
Jessica Pascoe
Florida will be without senior 
and 2018 SEC Women’s Runner of 
the Year Jessica Pascoe on Friday. 
But the UNF Invitational is seen 
as a more of a “rust buster,” 
according to Pascoe.
“It’s an ice breaker,” Pascoe 
said. “Just get your feet in the 
water, you know, shake off those 
nerves, everyone’s got them after 
coming off of a summer just to see 
what kind of shape you’re in.”
Instead, Pascoe plans to use 
this time to train in Gainesville. 
She isn’t the only runner not 
competing at UNF this year, 
either.
Eight runners on the women’s 
side and seven runners on the 
men’s side will also sit out of the 
first meet. Freshmen in the mix
Before the season began, 
Solinsky said to be on the lookout 
for freshmen Emily Culley and 
Hugh Brittenham before they 
make their debut for the Gators. 
They will get their chance come 
Friday.
Brittenham said he is a little 
nervous for his first meet and 
talked about the change going 
from being one of the most touted 
recruits in the state of Florida to 
being a freshman in a program 
like UF.
“You’ve been demoted to 
a small fish in a big pond,” 
Brittenham said. “Personally, I 
relish that, you know? It’s a good 
reminder on why I’m putting in 
so much effort. I want to make 
that climb back up again.”
Culley was still processing 
her first week in college but was 
ecstatic to be at UF and compete.
“I’m just so grateful to be 
here and running as a collegiate 
athlete is just a dream of mine,” 
Culley said. “So I hope to really 
affect the team in a good way.”

Florida’s 10th-ranked volley-
ball team will start its 2019 sea-
son with a pair of games against 
No. 25 Louisville on Friday night 
and Dayton on Saturday at the 
Cardinal Classic in Louisville, 
Kentucky. Here’s what to watch 
for:
A match against a ranked op-
ponent is in the cards
Louisville and UF met ear-
ly last season in Gainesville. 
Florida prevailed 3-1, with 
then-freshman Thayer Hall and 
then-redshirt sophomore Holly 
Carlton combining for 27 kills. 
The Cardinals will not only 
see Hall and Carlton again Fri-
day, but almost all of last year’s 
lineup, as well. The Gators re-
turn 14 of their 16 players from 
last season. 
Louisville isn’t unfamiliar 
territory to a handful of Gators, 
either. Sophomore Anaya Mar-
tin transferred to UF from Lou-
isville, and senior Allie Gregory 
and junior Paige Hammons are also from the city. 
Martin played in just 10 
matches for the Cardinals last 
season, but her addition gives 
the Gators more depth at the set-
ter position. It also allows Flor-
ida coach Mary Wise to utilize 
more right-side pin hitters, with 
subbing out Marlie Monserez 
at the front row and subbing in 
Martin at the back row.
Martin’s departure also gives 
Louisville one fewer option to 
replace former two-time ACC 
Setter of the Year Wilma Rivera. 
The Cardinals, voted third in the 
preseason ACC coaches poll, are 
also trying to replace All-ACC 
First Team libero Molly Sauer. 
However, the team retains two-
time First Team All-ACC outside 
hitter Melanie McHenry. 
McHenry, the only Louisville 
player on the preseason All-ACC 
team, led the Cardinals in kills 
in last season’s match against UF 
(14), though she only swung for 
a hitting percentage of .184. The 
junior was also the team leader 
in kills last season with 384. Saturday duel with Dayton
No matter the outcome Fri-
day, the Gators will have to re-
bound quickly, as they face Day-
ton less than 24 hours later. 
The Flyers won the Atlantic 
10 conference championship 
tournament last season and 
made it to the First Round of the 
NCAA Tournament, where they 
were swept by Louisville. 
Dayton graduated three se-
niors, including their team lead-
ers in kills (outside hitter Lauren 
Bruns) and total blocks (middle 
blocker Kendyll Brown). 
However, the Flyers had eight 
freshmen and four sophomores 
last season. Of the eight players 
who played in at least 100 sets 
last season, two were freshmen. 
With just two seniors and a bevy 
of underclassmen this year, the 
Flyers provide an interesting 
challenge with their youthful ex-
perience for the Gators, which 
can always lead to an unexpect-
ed result.

bfarrell@alligator.orgGators begin 2019 season with ranked matchup against Louisville
CROSS COUNTRYNow onto the picks…
Tyler “I Never Change My Badass 
Frat Composite Proﬁ  le Picture” Nettuno
leads the charge as sports editor here at the 
Alligator. Luckily for us, he has ﬁ  nally de-
cided to change his Twitter, Facebook and 
Instagram proﬁ  le picture after three years 
on staff. When was that pic even taken, 
Tyler? Your ﬁ  rst CJC Career Day? Y i k e 
s. Anyways, we appreciate the friendlier de-
meanor you have decided to take on social 
media following UF’s headache of a win 
against Miami. Now please, change your 
GroupMe photo, too, while you’re at it. 
Next, we have Assistant Sports Editor 
Mari “Every HR Department’s Worst 
Nightmare” Faiello, who thought that 
it would be a good idea to reinstitute the 
sports section “poll”, which basically boils 
down to an ofﬁ  ce popularity contest. It has 
resulted in every member of sports staff 
pandering to Mari to secure top spots on the 
pointless rankings. It’s ok, Mari. We get that 
you like judging people. Just don’t come 
crying to me when we have a mutiny on 
our hands.
Then we have Online Sports Editor Sam 
“Tinder God” Campisano, who felt the 
need to ask alligatorSports photographer 
Chris King to take a picture of him, alone, 
for the proﬁ  le of his dating app of choice. 
Even after Chris took a wholesome photo 
of all four football writers together. We’re 
glad Sam ﬁ  nally has a smoldering pic so he 
doesn’t have to complain about his sub-par 
proﬁ  le at the ofﬁ  ce anymore. We just hope 
he remembers us when he’s drowning in 
right swipes.
There’s Dylan “Do You Know Who 
My Dad Is?” Rudolph, whose father — while handing out credentials at Camping 
World Stadium — introduced himself to Ty-
ler by saying, “You work with my son.” It’s 
cool, Dylan. Your dad’s a big shot. It just 
would’ve been nice if he could’ve given us 
more than two seats in the press box for 
four people.
Then you have the pretentious Kyle 
“Staff Writer aka Hybrid Reporter” 
Wood, who doesn’t even have the gen-
eral decency anymore to identify himself a 
sports writer. It’s sad to say that sports isn’t 
good enough for him, which is why sprots 
(yes, the typo is intentional) catches him 
canoodling with news every time he comes 
into the ofﬁ  ce for copy editing. We get it 
Kyle, you’re talented and think you’re the 
best. And while you may have news fooled, 
you can’t fool us. 
That completes The Alligator’s staff. 
Now to introduce our guest pickers.
First there’s the Gainesville Sun’s 
Graham “No Cheering in the Press 
Box” Hall. Graham felt the need to 
share his concerns about bias at Satur-
day’s game by sliding into Tyler’s Twit-
ter DMs. Apparently, a certain repre-
sentative from a certain non-UF student 
newspaper was wearing a polo with a 
certain, well-known, U-shaped sports 
logo on it. We get it, Graham, you’re a 
purist. But calm down, we all know you 
wore a Florida shirt a time or two during 
your Alligator editor days.
Then there’s GatorCountry’s Nick 
“Feleipe Franks is the Starting Quar-
terback” de la Torre, who masochis-
tically feels the need to hold a halftime 
Q&A for every game. Even when Flor-
ida’s trailing at the break to a team it 
was supposed to blow out. Let’s get real, 
99% of those questions are dumpster 
ﬁ  res, and yet, you persist. You’re an ad-
dict, and we understand. But how many different ways can you say that we aren’t 
going to see Emory Jones?
Who could forget the Orlando Sentinel’s 
Edgar “Put Me In Coach” Thompson, 
who played the role of an offensive lineman 
when Feleipe Franks reenacted his second 
interception. There’s nothing wrong with 
reliving the glory days, Edgar. But for your 
sake and Feleipe’s, we’re glad you weren’t 
blocking on that play. If so, this section 
would be in memoriam.
The ﬁ  nal representative of our returning 
guest pickers is the AP’s Mark “Gamblin’” 
Long, whose love of picking college foot-
ball games outweighed his general disdain 
for student media. We’re glad to have you, 
Mark. Please like us.
And ﬁ  nally, we have two newcomers 
in Sports Illustrated-GatorMaven’s Zach 
Goodall and ChompTalk’s Brian Fox, both 
of whom have inexplicably decided to be a 
part of this disaster. Welcome aboard, gen-
tlemen. We know you’ll regret it.in the AP Top 25. Florida 
fans should watch with a 
keen eye to see how the 
Tigers respond to their 
ﬁ  rst big test and see if they 
pose an obstacle come 
Oct. 5 when both teams 
meet in Gainesville.
Honorable Mention: 
Florida State vs. Boise 
State, Noon
Though Florida State 
will pose the last obstacle 
of the regular season for 
Florida — as it does every 
year — it’s never too early 
to start scouting for weak-
nesses.
FSU is expected to 
have a revamped offense with newly hired offensive 
coordinator Kendal Briles 
and more experience on 
an offensive line that was 
a massive hindrance a 
year ago.
If the Gators live up to 
their own expectations, 
the playoffs will be well 
within grasp by Nov. 30, 
and the Seminoles will be 
its last trial.
