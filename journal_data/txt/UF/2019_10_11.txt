SUPPORTERS, 
PROTESTERS 
ATTENDED 
By Ana Escalante 
Alligator Staff Writer
Donald Trump Jr. tried 
to address a crowd of more 
than 800 people at UF on 
Thursday evening. 
Instead, he found him-
self bickering with protest-
ers in the audience. 
UF ACCENT Speakers 
Bureau hosted Trump Jr. 
and Kimberly Guilfoyle — 
his girlfriend and a senior 
adviser on President Don-
ald Trump’s 2020 campaign 
— in a keynote presenta-
tion on Thursday night  at 
the University Auditorium.
ACCENT paid both 
speakers a total of $50,000, 
which comes from $19.06 per credit hour students 
pay each semester. 
ACCENT originally 
scheduled a 15-minute 
Q&A, but became nervous 
of protestors hijacking the 
microphone, said Cameron 
Gittler, assistant director of 
productions. The speakers 
selected questions from a 
Twitter hashtag instead.
Trump Jr. highlighted 
some of the accomplish-
ments of his father’s ad-
ministration, such as the 
declining number of Ameri-
cans on food stamps and 
record-low unemployment 
rates for minorities. He also 
mentioned the danger that 
socialism and communism 
brought to countries such 
as China and Venezuela. 
He occasionally stopped 
speaking to confront pro-
testers yelling over him. “What is interesting 
about ideas is that your 
ideas can’t be all that good 
if you’re not willing to let 
other people speak theirs,” 
Trump Jr. said.  
When Guilfoyle began 
a sentence with “I have a 
dream,” people in the au-
dience became agitated, 
chanting “Bull****!” To 
drown out their cries, sup-
porters repeated, “USA! 
USA! USA!” 
She continued to speak, 
but the chants from the au-
dience made the rest of her 
statement inaudible. 
“Oh, your parents must 
be so proud,” she said in 
response. 
Florida Sen. Keith Perry, 
Gator Party President Emily 
Dunson and Student Body 
President Michael Murphy PROTESTERS DENOUNCED 
$50,000 PAYMENT 
Staff Report 
A protester hoisted a sign reading “Three 
I’s for Trump: impeach, indict, imprison,” 
above the crowd.
Others carried “Murphy + Fuchs resign,” 
and “Don’t give my student fees to Nazis.” 
They weren’t just protesting the presi-
dent’s son in town; they were protesting the 
use of student funds to pay for it.  
Protesters gathered Thursday night in op-
position to ACCENT Speakers Bureau’s use of 
student activity fees to pay Donald Trump Jr. 
and Kimberly Guilfoyle, a senior adviser on 
his father’s 2020 presidential re-election cam-
paign and Trump Jr.’s girlfriend. The organi-
zation paid the duo $50,000 to speak at the 
University Auditorium.
The #CHOMPTRUMP protest was orga-
nized by a group of students and activists 
Oct. 1, the same day ACCENT announced the 
speakers. 
The protest began with about 100 people 
but quickly grew to more than 300 just before 
the beginning of the speech at 7 p.m. At its peak, about 400 protesters were outside.
The crowd spoke against Donald Trump 
and his son, but also directed criticism at 
UF Student Body President Michael Murphy 
while chanting, “Michael Murphy, do what’s 
right! Quit enabling the alt-right!”
One concern some students have is Mur-
phy’s father’s connection to the Trump ad-
ministration as a high-paying campaign con-
tributor. 
Soon after the ACCENT announcement, 
#CHOMPTRUMP called for an apology and 
resignation from key members of UF Student 
Government, including Murphy and ACCENT 
Chair Henry Fair.
However, some protesters showed up to 
speak against Donald Trump directly. Ruth 
Chase, who traveled from Tallahassee for the 
protest, dressed in a prison jumpsuit and gi-
ant papier-mâché President Trump head with 
a gaping mouth. 
“Corruption is always there,” Chase, 71, 
said. “It’s always just waiting for people to get 
comfortable.” 
There wasn’t a shortage of Trump sup-
porters, either. Turning Point USA founder

THE NEW CAMPUS TO COST 
ABOUT $36.5 MILLION
By Lexi Bryant
Alligator Contributing Writer
Jackson Sasser shoveled the ﬁ  rst piece of 
ground for Santa Fe’s new campus Wednes-
day, which will be completed after his term 
as president is over. 
The new Blount Center, to become the 
Blount Campus, is scheduled to begin con-
struction this summer and ﬁ  nish by Spring 
2022, said Liam McClay, Santa Fe senior ad-
viser to the president and vice president of 
facilities services.
The project will cost about $36.5 million 
and the new campus will hold about 2,500 
students, McClay said. 
Students, donors, city commissioners, San-
ta Fe faculty and staff attended the ground-
breaking and saw pictures showing the new 
campus’ plan. 
The three-story building will offer business 
and information technology programs, asso-
ciate’s and bachelor’s programs, community 
education, a business incubator and student 
services including advisers and ﬁ  nancial aid, 
McClay said. 
“Our goal is to bring increased opportu-
nities to students in the service district area and enhance small business opportunities,” 
he said. 
The Blount Center is located at 401 NW 
Sixth St. It’s currently a smaller facility that 
offers GED preparation courses, training pro-
grams for businesses and serves as an out-
reach and educational facility for citizens in 
the area. 
The center also offers free meeting rooms 
for civic, business and professional groups, 
but its current size can’t accommodate as 
many students as administration would like 
to, he said. 
McClay said he hopes people see this cam-
pus as an opportunity to help their futures. 
Beyond Santa Fe students, he wants to recruit 
people looking to continue their education, 
people who don’t believe higher education is 
for them and UF students to dual enroll.
“We want to make sure our footprint is 
here and it’s to stay,” McClay said. “That peo-
ple recognize it, see it and then believe that 
they can be a part of us.”
Sasser will retire in the Spring. He said he 
has been watching the college transform for 
almost 18 years. Paul Broadie II, the president 
of Connecticut’s Housatonic Community Col-
lege and Gateway Community College, was 
selected to replace Sasser.  
“It’s about opening doors to students,” 
Sasser said. “I’m just one little part of that and I’m so honored to have been a part.”
Sasser said he wants everyone to feel like 
their education is important whether they are 
obtaining their GED or PhD, and this campus will be in the center of that activity. 
“It’s a symbol of excellence that we com-
mit to,” Sasser said. “It’s a symbol of our 
commitment to this community.”Santa Fe College breaks ground on new Blount Campus

The Blount Center Board of Directors break ground at the new Blount Campus building at Santa

HE REMAINS IN JAIL AS OF 
THURSDAY EVENING
By Dana Cassidy
Alligator Staff Writer
Authorities arrested a second 
person in relation to the home in-
vasion robbery that resulted in one 
dead and one injured.
Jevin D. Hilliard, 26, was arrested 
and charged for murder, attempted murder, posses-
sion of a weapon 
by a convicted 
felon and robbery 
Thursday after-
noon in regards 
to the Sept. 29 
early morning in-
cident, according 
to an Alachua County Sheriff’s Of-
ﬁ  ce release. 
Bryan G. Williams was arrested last Wednesday on similar charges 
for the same incident.
Jonathan Morris, 25, and an 
unnamed 22-year-old were found 
at the house on the 1200 block of 
Southwest 75th Drive with gunshot 
wounds. Morris was dead when of-
ﬁ  cers arrived. Hilliard was found 
injured about half a mile away af-
ter the two victims were found, also 
with gunshot wounds.
Hilliard and the injured man in the home were both taken to UF 
Health Shands Hospital, where law 
enforcement eventually learned 
Hilliard was connected to the in-
cident, according to the release. 
Hilliard was taken to the Alachua 
County Jail after leaving the hospi-
tal Thursday.
Hilliard and William’s sworn 
complaint afﬁ  davits, which detail 
speciﬁ  cally why they were arrested, 
are completely redacted as of Thurs-day afternoon, according to county 
records.
Hilliard remains in the Alachua 
County Jail on a $1.25 million bond 
for robbery, attempted murder and 
possession of a ﬁ  rearm as a felon. 
He has no bond for the charge of 
murder, according to county re-
cords.

18 AGENCIES 
PARTICIPATED 
IN DRILL 
By Jordyn Kalman
Alligator Staff Writer
Passengers lay on the 
ground next to the smoking, 
severed airplane. The sound of 
helicopter blades chopping the 
air, ﬁ  re truck horns and ambu-
lance sirens drowned out their 
moans.
But the injuries were just 
makeup, and the “dead” were 
inﬂ  atable dolls.
This was all part of a full-
scale emergency exercise held 
at the Gainesville Regional Air-
port Wednesday morning as 
part of the airport’s emergen-
cy operations plan, said Erin 
Porter, the Gainesville Airport 
manager of marketing and pub-
lic relations. 
This year, the scenario was 
a simulated plane crash, Porter 
said. The goal of these full-scale 
drills is to make the scenario 
appear as real as possible.
“This is practicing for some-
thing we never want to have 
happen,” Porter said. “But it is really, really great that we do.”
About 60 students from 
Santa Fe College Emergency 
Medical Services programs vol-
unteered to act as victims and 
had mock injuries applied be-
fore the event started, Porter 
said. Once emergency respond-
ers arrived, the actors were 
bandaged and placed in ambu-
lances to simulate being driven 
to the hospital.
Eighteen federal and local 
agencies participated, Porter 
said. The airport remained 
open during the drill, which 
did not affect any incoming or 
outgoing ﬂ  ights.
The Federal Aviation Ad-
ministration requires that all air 
carrier airport operators hold a 
full-scale exercise at least once 
every three years, Porter said. 
The Gainesville Regional Air-
port also hosts smaller “table-
top” exercises every year.
There hasn’t been a plane 
crash at the airport since 2006, 
according to the Gainesville 
Sun. 
Lauren Lettelier, the North 
Florida Regional Medical Cen-
ter director of public relations 
and communications, oversaw the treatment of the victims. 
She said body doubles were 
already waiting at the hospital 
with matching injuries so stu-
dents didn’t have to be trans-
ported from the airport.
The hospital had to cut the 
exercise short by an hour be-
cause there were too many real 
patients coming in at the same 
time, Lettelier said. 
“I think communication 
was the number one theme, 
making sure that we’re all talk-
ing to each other and all of our 
systems work,” Lettelier said.
Sgt. Lisa Scott, the 
Gainesville Police accreditation 
manager, said that during the 
drill, ofﬁ  cers set a perimeter 
around the crash site to provide 
access for medical services and 
keep civilians out as well as to 
assist the ﬁ  re rescue and EMTs.
“I think any drill or training 
exercises is always a success,” 
Scott said. “Because even if it 
doesn’t work out, well, you 
learn from it.”

THE FREE EVENT TO BE 
HELD SATURDAY
By Meghan McGlone
Alligator Staff Writer
Butterﬂ  y wings will ﬂ  utter among UF 
students at the Florida Museum of Natural 
History on Saturday. 
The 14th annual Butterﬂ  yFest will in-
clude a plant sale, butterﬂ  y gardening work-
shops, a children’s area and performances 
by Danscompany of Gainesville, a local 
children and adults dance group, said Cath-
erine Carey, the museum’s public programs coordinator.
The plant sale will be on Friday, Satur-
day and Sunday and will include plants for 
butterﬂ  y gardens. The money the museum 
raises from the plant sale will support con-
servation research and education, Carey 
said.
“The nice thing about Butterﬂ  yFest is 
there’s something for everyone,” Carey 
said. “Be prepared to have some fun.”
The theme of the free event this year is 
“Pollinator Power,” Carey said. The fes-
tival’s goal is to bring awareness to but-
terﬂ  ies and other pollinators as important 
parts of nature. Pollinators, such as but-terﬂ  ies, bees, bats and birds, are vital to 
ﬂ  owering plants and human crops, as one 
in every three bites of food has a direct link 
to pollinators, Carey said. 
Carey hopes visitors enjoy the museum 
and make it part of their regular weekend. 
She encouraged people to help pollinators 
by starting butterﬂ  y gardens or using fewer 
pesticides.
“I want [visitors] to walk away realizing 
how important pollinators are in their day-
to-day lives,” Carey said.
Last year, more than 3,200 people at-
tended the event, Carey said. Attendees in 
past years have included people of all ages and from all over Florida. Carey expects at-
tendance to be high if the weather is nice. 
Madison Turner, an 18-year-old UF mar-
keting freshman, will volunteer at the event 
because she visited the butterﬂ  y exhibit 
with her father as a child. She is volunteer-
ing with UF Circle K International, a non-
proﬁ  t service organization. 
“I think it will be a really fun experience 
to bond more with my club and learn more 
about butterﬂ  ies and how they affect our 
environment,” Turner said.

Lt. Kenneth Johnson, paramedic for Gainesville Fire and Rescue’s airport station, 
examines an inﬂ  atable dummy Wednesday during the emergency drill. The 
dummies were set out to simulate dead bodies. Johnson said he takes the drills 
seriously because they help prepare for the real thing. “I’ve done it enough times 
with real dead bodies, ” he said. “I’d much rather check the pulse on a mannequin. ”
attended the event. 
Guilfoyle spoke about being the 
senior adviser to the president after 
years of hard work. As a first-gener-
ation Latin American, she said she 
lives her life free of the victimhood 
that plagues some on the other side of 
the political spectrum.
Before the speech, Raemi Eagle-
Glenn, a Gainesville attorney, waved 
a Trump flag almost twice her size. 
Her cousin got it for her at Trump’s 
election night party in 2016. She’s 
plans to vote for him again. 
“I’m here because I’m a feminist, 
because I believe in going against the 
crowd and fighting for our national 
sovereignty and for our economic 
freedom,” Eagle-Glenn said.  
Outside, protesters opposed the 
SG-funded event and a possible con-nection to Trump’s re-election cam-
paign. 
#CHOMPTRUMP organizers said 
Michael Murphy’s ties to the Trump 
campaign were a conflict of interest. 
Murphy’s father, Dan Murphy, a for-
mer UF lobbyist, maxed out contri-
butions and has been spotted with 
Trump Jr. this year, according to Po-
litico. Murphy wrote there was “no 
conflict of interest,” in an email to 
The Alligator earlier this week. 
Trump Jr. directly thanked Murphy 
during his 30-minute-long speech. 
“Thanks University of Florida and 
the Gators, Mike Murphy, ACCENT 
Speakers Bureau, for having us out 
here today,” Trump Jr. said “Honestly 
guys, that takes guts and we appreci-
ate it because that voice isn’t heard of-
ten on college campuses these days.”

in November, also attended the protest saying he 
was there because he loves free speech. Kirk has 
two upcoming “Culture War” tour dates featuring 
Trump Jr. this month.  
Kirk asked protesters, “Don’t you like President 
Trump? He’s doing such a good job! Why are you 
guys so angry?” 
A protester yelled back, “You’re white! Of 
course you can say that!”
Michael Wyatt, a Santa Fe construction man-
agement freshman, described himself as “very 
conservative” and came to the protest wearing a 
“Make America Great Again” hat and Trump flag 
as a cape. 
“They totally have the right to protest, and I 
don’t mind them being here,” Wyatt said. “But, at 
the same time, I definitely disagree.” 
The #CHOMPTRUMP protest didn’t go without 
conflict. A man wearing a “Make America Great 
Again” hat and Donald Trump shirt carried a sign 
that read, “ISLAM WAS RIGHT ABOUT WOMEN.” Another man tried taking the man’s hat, and a 
fight broke out. Police intervened and both men 
were taken away, but the man who was wearing 
the hat returned. 
Savannah Gribbins, a 24-year-old second-year 
UF law student, protested against the $50,000 paid 
to the speaking duo as well as the speakers them-
selves. 
She said that she wouldn’t be able to attend 
law school without her scholarship and that the 
$50,000 could have gone toward scholarship 
funds. She was initially upset because of the cost 
but became more concerned when she learned 
about Murphy’s connection to Trump Jr. 
“If you’re going to bring in speakers that are so 
completely biased on one side, at least get some 
input from the Student Body before you spend our 
funds on it,” she said. 
April Rubin, Hope Dean, Alyssa Feliciano 
and Alex DeLuca contributed to this report.

Column
Getting rowdy for intersectional feminism
Plus-size people, people of color and 
the LGBTQ+ community don’t always 
conform to the Eurocentric beauty stan-
dards that have become so prevalent in 
contemporary culture. These communi-
ties consistently face certain scrutinies and op-
pressions, which often leads to invisibility of 
these individuals in popular media. How can 
we put an end to this? The answer is simple: 
Fill media with the images and the stories of 
these people.
At UF, one of the largest platforms these communi-
ties have is Rowdy Magazine. On Oct. 14, this student-
run fashion publication will release its second issue af-
ter nearly a year of silence, and anyone interested in the 
magazine has a lot to be excited about.
The themes of the issue are diversity and inclusiv-
ity — hallmarks that Ana Escalante, assistant creative 
director, is very proud to tout. She said, “Representa-
tion is the most important thing to me. Because I am a 
plus-size Latino woman, and a lot of traditional fashion 
magazines don’t have me in mind.” 
Rowdy offers students the opportunity to write for 
a very different type of publication than what is of-
fered through conventional channels here at UF. It of-
fers much more creative ﬂ  exibility among its staff and 
speaks of diversity within its pages as its mission.
At the same time, outlets for fashion at UF are few 
and far between, with no dedicated clubs or organiza-
tions other than the two recently founded publications, 
Strike and Rowdy. Students interested in careers in the 
fashion industry have been ﬂ  ocking to these magazines 
looking to make their mark and improve their resumes. Torri McFarlane already knew that she was 
going into the fashion industry, but because 
of her time with Rowdy, she has become even 
more cemented in her goals. UF doesn’t of-
fer majors, minors, programs or certiﬁ  cates 
in writing for these types of publications, but 
McFarlane said that Rowdy has helped her 
meet people in Gainesville also interested in  
fashion. 
The magazine does face struggles, though. 
Escalante says that the cost of printing is a hurdle that 
the team has to overcome every time they set out to 
publish a new issue.
While Rowdy receives funding from the ads between 
its pages and the copies that it sells, its primary source 
of funding is the proﬁ  ts from its launch party; which is 
set to be held Oct. 18 at 7 p.m. at the SL8 Gallery on 10 
E University Ave. 
Copies of the magazine will be sold throughout the 
prior week at Turlington Hall, Plaza of the Americas 
and the Reitz Union.
If you’re interested in supporting intersectional femi-
nism or care about students pursuing careers in fash-
ion, I suggest you lend your support to publications like 
Rowdy and Strike. 
Next week, when you see Rowdy’s cart and they call 
you over, try to give them a bit of your time – you’re 
supporting some valid causes.

Things are getting a bit difﬁ  cult.
You thought studying in the library would make 
things better, but the sea of voices is more like white noise. Even 
the table you’re sitting at seems like a soft pillow at this point. 
You’ve gotten too used to taking naps in the lounge chairs on the 
second ﬂ  oor of Library West; they almost feel like your second 
home.
The fact that you’re absolutely exhausted at 2 p.m. doesn’t 
help either. You shouldn’t be struggling to keep your eyes 
open, but you can’t help but feel comfort in the way your 
friends are talking about dogs. You really wish you were pet-
ting a dog right now.
Before you drift off, a group next to yours starts laughing 
loudly about something they drew on the whiteboard. Instantly, 
you’re back in the world of the living.
One of your friends stops talking and points in the direction of 
the board. First, you see an outdated picture of Spongebob that 
shouldn’t be funny anymore.
Underneath it you see...
Darts and Laurels
This week, it’s mostly laurels. There are a lot of bad things 
happening on campus right now, so the Alligator Editorial Board 
decided to shine some light on the people who are doing good.
Although we won’t be blessed with new music anytime soon, 
Rihanna still deserves a laurel for supporting Colin Kaeper-
nick and ofﬁ  cially announcing why she turned down the half-
time show at this year’s Super Bowl. The queen goes on to give 
President Donald Trump a ﬁ  re diss about the state of his mental 
health; we just wish she’d incorporate it into her music.
Another laurel has to go to “Sesame Street” for incorporating 
a new Muppet named Karli who has a mother struggling with 
opioid abuse. According to the Guardian, 5.7 million children 
under the age of 11 live in households with a parent that had a 
substance abuse disorder. Thank you, Karli, for highlighting an 
issue most people aren’t familiar with and for doing something 
about it.
Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner is doing some-
thing for the underrepresented as well. On Wednesday, he suc-
cessfully exonerated his 10th prisoner of this year: Willie Veasy. 
Thursday, Veasy walked out of prison a free man after being un-
justly imprisoned for 27 years. The district attorney gets a lau-
rel for combating the unjust convictions of our corrupt prison 
system.
Here at UF, we like to ﬁ  ght corruption too. 
This Thursday, we had the “privilege” of having Donald 
Trump Jr. come to speak for us, alongside his girlfriend, Kimberly 
Guilfoyle, who also happens to be the president’s senior adviser 
within his re-election campaign. Although we were told that this  
event wouldn’t be part of the campaign, it’s hard to believe when 
UF Student Government pays for someone nobody asked for.
The last laurel has to go to the #CHOMPTRUMP organizers 
who put together the rally. A lot of time, consideration and com-
passion goes into creating these kinds of events, but it’s also im-
portant to be patient, caring and compassionate toward people as 
well. We can’t stop bigotry from being heard, but maybe we can 
stop it before its created in the ﬁ  rst place.
But before we forgive those who hate, we have to give a dart 
to Donald Trump Jr. for his and his family’s history of racism and 
lack of compassion for people of color and other minorities. Not 
only is it insulting that we have to listen to the third most politi-
cally inept Trump (as he slightly beats his younger half-brother 
Barron), but we have to deal with the atmosphere of intolerance 
and tension that comes with him as well.
Gracias por venir, Trumpito. Esperamos que no volvamos a ver 
a su familia aquí o en la Casa Blanca nunca más.

What is the best way to evalu-
ate offense in volleyball?
Comparing how many kills a 
player has to another isn’t fair 
because they could have more 
swings. Hitting percentage is a 
good start, but that is still not 
necessarily the best answer. 
Better players may draw more 
attention defensively or hit more 
from low-percentage areas of the 
court. Defenses are going to be 
much more prepared for Flori-
da’s star outside hitter Thayer 
Hall than outside hitters Paige 
Hammons and Mia Sokolowski.   
Twitter user and site man-
ager for SB Nation’s Raw Charge       @loserpoints, also known as 
Alan, came up with a new way 
to balance both total attacks and 
hitting percentage: Hitting Points 
Above Average (HPAA). 
So here’s what you need to 
know about HPAA:
How does it work?
The formula is simple: (Kills - 
errors) — (Total attacks * .2)
The ﬁ  rst half of the formula 
gives you what Alan calls “hit-
ting points.” The second half re-
sults in the number of kills you 
would expect from an average 
player for however many attacks 
they had. The .2 comes from the 
average hitting percentage na-
tionwide of roughly 20 percent.
Thus, HPAA tells you how many hitting points a player has 
compared to the average player if 
they both had the same number 
of attacks.
But HPAA is also a volume 
stat. Players who play more have 
higher HPAAs because they have 
more attacks and potentially 
games played. 
The solution is to divide 
HPAA by games played to get 
the HPAA per match. You end up 
with similar results, but it also 
accounts for games played. 
For example, let’s take Hall, 
who has 186 kills and 65 er-
rors on 492 swings. Following 
the HPAA formula, the result is 
22.32, the highest on the team. 
Dividing it by her 14 matches 
played gives you an HPAA per match of 1.59, which ranks 20th 
in the SEC. 
So what does this mean, and 
what can this tell us about the 
Gators?
The good news for Florida is 
that it has six players among the 
top 40 in the SEC by HPAA. No 
other team has more than ﬁ  ve. 
Hall, Holly Carlton (22.04) and 
middle blocker Lauren Dooley 
(18.34) lead the Gators in HPAA. 
One of the beneﬁ  ts of HPAA 
is that it tells us some things that 
hitting percentage or kills alone 
wouldn’t tell you. Hall is sev-
enth on the team in hitting per-
centage out of the nine players FOOTBALL

You know that paradoxical 
question: “What happens when an 
unstoppable force meets meets an 
immovable object?”
College football fans might get 
an answer to that question Satur-
day night in Death Valley.
The unstoppable force would 
be No. 5 LSU’s offense, which av-
erages a nation-leading 54.6 points 
per game. And the immovable 
object is No. 7 Florida’s defense, 
which is top-ﬁ  ve in scoring defense 
and leads the country in red zone 
defense.
One of these two will have to 
give, and the over/under of 56 
means the oddsmakers think it will 
be the Gators defense that bends.
UF’s defense has been stout 
— only allowing one touchdown 
in 13 quarters and recording two 
shutouts — but LSU’s offense has 
been historically good. The Ti-
gers broke Alabama's record from 
2018 for points scored through six 
games by an SEC team. Redshirt 
senior quarterback Joe Burrow and 
a radical change to the offense is 
why.
Burrow is far and away the best 
quarterback UF's defense will see 
this season. His 22 passing touch-
downs are tied for the second-most 
in the country and his 1,864 pass-
ing yards are good for No. 2.
And he has a talented wide 
receiving corps at his disposal. 
The Tigers have three players 
with more than 300 yards and 20 catches, led by junior Justin Jef-
ferson whose 30 catches for 547 
yards and seven touchdowns are 
all among the best marks by any 
FBS wideout.
Burrow is also ridiculously efﬁ  -
cient, leading the country in com-
pletion percentage (78.4 percent). 
He has, however, been sacked nine 
times in ﬁ  ve games. The Gators ex-
cel at getting to the quarterback, 
bringing down the opposing team’s 
play caller 4.3 times per game.
But unless Burrow is brought 
down, pressure does not seem to 
phase him, as his completion per-
centage hardly dips under pres-
sure.
The Burrow-led air attack has 
altered a traditionally run-heavy 
program into a passing power-
house capable of putting up 50 
points per game with ease.  The 
fewest points LSU has scored in a 
game this season is 42.
On the other hand, Florida’s 
highest opponent scoring output 
is just 21. Defensive coordinator 
Todd Grantham preaches that his 
players need just a blade of grass to 
defend. So far this season, they’ve 
lived up to that mantra.
UF has allowed its opponents 
to score ﬁ  ve times in 14 trips in-
side the 20. Three of those scoring 
trips have resulted in touchdowns. 
To put into context how good that 
mark is, Florida leads the country 
by allowing opponents to score in 
the red zone 35.7 percent of the 
time. The next best team in that 
regard, Temple, allows opponents 
to score 52.6 percent of the time.Grad transfer linebacker Jona-
than Greenard has been a huge 
lift for the Gators defensive unit, 
which will be at full strength for 
the ﬁ  rst time since the Kentucky 
game with the return of defensive 
end Jabari Zuniga. Greenard and 
Zuniga are ﬁ  rst and second on the 
team in sacks, respectively, and 
lead a dangerous front seven.
But if Burrow’s ﬁ  rst ﬁ  ve games 
are any indication of how Saturday 
will go, the secondary will still get 
plenty of work. This unit is high-
lighted by cornerbacks C.J. Hen-
derson and Marco Wilson and the 
emergence of safety Shawn Davis, 
who leads the team in intercep-
tions.
Florida’s run defense is No. 
15 in the country and its passing 
defense is No. 18. Both units are among the best in the FBS and 
they’re both capable of creating 
turnovers, another defensive cate-
gory where UF excels. The Gators’ 
17 turnovers lead the nation.
Keeping the ball out of Bur-
row’s hands will be key for this 
unit come Saturday’s showdown. 
The problem for Florida is he 
doesn’t make many mistakes, hav-
ing thrown just three interceptions 
all season.
So UF will have to force him 
into mistakes if it is to put an end 
to the Tigers’ eight-game streak of 
scoring 40 or more points and ex-
tend its own winning streak to 11 
games.

CROSS COUNTRYWOMEN’S GOLF MEN’S TENNISBy Graham Marsh
Sports Writer
Ole Miss midfielder Haleigh 
Stackpole took a Rebels free kick 
and placed a perfectly curved cross 
to the skull of forward Molly Martin. 
Martin tapped it up and over Susi 
Espinoza, whose glove was just out 
of reach, and the ball softly rolled 
into the net. 
That goal placed unranked Ole 
Miss up 3-2 on the newly ranked 
No. 19 Gators. Three whistles 
sounded from the referee 14 min-
utes later and the decision was final: 
Ole Miss defeated Florida for the first 
time since 2009. UF’s six-match win 
streak and undefeated SEC start to 
2019 was slain in Oxford, Missis-
sippi, Thursday night. To commence the action, mid-
fielder Cassidy Lindley had two Ole 
Miss defenders looming between her 
and any decent crossing opportunity 
in the 25th minute of the match. She 
tried a left-footed aerial ball anyway, 
but it was deflected back to Lind-
ley’s better foot. 
Then, she had a clean look and 
placed it across the 18-yard box to 
the feet of forward Madison Alex-
ander just outside the 6-yard box 
to the right of the net. Alexander 
ripped the ball back left and it flew 
past Ole Miss goalie Ashley Orkus 
into the final destination; It was 1-0 
Gators and the Rebels seemed over-
whelmed. 
As a result, the entire first half 
was controlled by UF in terms of 
possession and chances, yet not on the scoreboard. An opening half that 
felt it would conclude a one-goal ad-
vantage for Florida was neutralized 
in the 39th minute by the Ole Miss. 
Rebels midfielder Sydney Micha-
lak was just past midfield toward the 
right sideline and curled an airborne 
pass into the Gators’ 18-yard box 
to forward Channing Foster. Fos-
ter executed the slightest of taps to 
squeak past UF’s backline and creat-
ed a one-on-one opportunity against 
Gators’ goalie Espinoza. 
She then drove her right foot 
through the ball just outside the 
6-yard box from left to right into the 
goal, scoreline 1-1. The final six min-
utes of the half presented a drasti-
cally different Ole Miss, in terms of 
swagger and effort. 
While no other chances landed, the remainder of the half’s opportu-
nities belonged to the squad wearing 
red with its blue, instead of orange. 
The referee’s whistle at the 45-min-
ute mark seemingly bailed out UF 
heading to the locker room. 
The first minute of the second 
half proved that it did. Less than 
60 seconds into the final period, 
Ole Miss forward Lonnie Mulligan 
dribbled between two UF defenders 
like a point guard in basketball and 
hooked a ball from right to left past 
Espinoza. 
However, the 2-1 advantage did 
not last as long as the 1-1 draw did. 
One minute after Mulligan’s score, 
Lindley entered the stat sheet once 
again, this time in the scoring col-
umn instead of the assist column, 
via a deflection. The inaugural strike smacked a Rebel and flew up into 
the air.
The ball came back down, found 
Lindley’s cleats and she tried again. 
This one went unscathed  across the 
box into the right side of the goal to 
stalemate the match once more. 
Then, the 76th minute brought 
the score off of the free kick from 
Martin and undid the tie for the final 
time. Coach Becky Burleigh’s side 
that flew to Oxford boasting a flaw-
less conference record now has its 
first SEC blemish of 2019.

The Florida cross country team 
has seen almost all of its players 
come down with what one runner 
called “the plague.”
The Gators have been battling 
this sickness for weeks and are just 
getting over it as they head to Tal-
lahassee for the FSU Invitational Fri-
day at 7:40 a.m. Unfortunately for 
Florida, the damage from the sick-
ness was done at the Virginia/Pan-
orama Farms Invitational two weeks 
ago:
 
Women’s team and sickness
When the women toed the line 
at UVA, sophomore Imogen Barrett 
found herself at the mercy of this 
sickness and began vomiting just 
before the race began. It got to the 
point where the phlegm caused dif-
ficulty breathing and kept her from 
finishing the women’s 6K, according to assistant coach Chris Solinsky.
Thanks to senior Jessica Pascoe’s 
first-place finish, the team was able 
to salvage what they could at Vir-
ginia, finishing sixth. Solinksy also 
talked about how redshirt fresh-
men Maria Fernandez and Pamela 
O’Brien stepped up when Barrett 
went down.
“For them, I’d say that was a 
career race,” Solinsky said. “I think 
they’re going to continue to have 
those types of performances and mo-
ments.”
 
Men’s team still finding their way
With the team still fighting this 
sickness, it’ll need help from its en-
tire roster when traveling to FSU. 
The Seminoles may not feel the same 
way, however.
Florida State will not use their top 
runners for their home meet in an at-
tempt to conserve them for the later 
parts of the season, Solinsky said. 
This may be a good opportunity for Florida to gain some confidence, es-
pecially on the men’s side.
UF finished ninth in the men’s 
8K at the UVA Invitational. Solinsky 
saw some old habits reemerge that 
did not reflect what he has seen in 
training.
“What they’re doing in training, 
and I feel like a broken record, it’s 
very elite stuff,” he said.
The third-year coach went on to 
elaborate and said that the team is 
sometimes scared to take risks when 
competing in a public competition.
“The best fruit is at the end of 
the branch,” Solinsky said. “To get 
that, you kind of have to let go of 
the trunk to reach the end of that 
branch.”

The fall campaign has been 
successful for the Gators.
The women played their first 
54 holes of the year in a blazing 
24 under at the season-opening 
Cougar Classic, earning third 
place in what was ultimately a 
full-fledged shootout. The next 
week, UF captured its first win 
of the year in Toledo, Ohio, at 
the Glass City Invitational on the 
famed Inverness Club.
In their most recent start, 
however, the Gators succumbed 
to final round woes, falling from 
the top of the leaderboard with 
18 holes remaining to finish in 
third at the Northwestern-hosted 
Windy City Collegiate. It was a 
reality check for a No. 6-ranked 
squad that has faced little ad-
versity thus far in its fall slate of 
tournaments.
“Today was a great experi-ence and one I think we will 
learn a lot from,” coach Em-
ily Glaser said directly following 
her team’s disappointing final 
round. “We will try and learn 
from [the finish] and get better 
moving forward.”
Less than two weeks re-
moved from their late stumble 
in Chicago, the Gators return 
to competition this weekend 
for the final time this fall at the 
Stanford Intercollegiate among 
another high-caliber field.
Eight of the 17 teams in the 
field this weekend are ranked, 
according to the Women’s Golf 
Coaches Association rankings, 
among them are: No. 4 USC, No. 
8 Arizona State, No. 10. Stan-
ford, No. 11 Arizona and No. 12 
UCLA.
It’s the final opportunity for 
Glaser and her contingent to 
prove their worth and gather 
competitive reps before the 
much more intensified Spring 
schedule begins in February.However, Florida will play 
severely shorthanded.
Senior Sierra Brooks, who 
leads the team with an elite 
70.33 stroke average, will not 
make the trip to NorCal with 
her teammates this weekend. 
The 15th-ranked amateur in 
the world previously committed 
to Stage II of LPGA Qualifying 
School, and will instead travel to 
Venice, Florida to try to earn her 
tour card.
Starting for Florida without 
her will be juniors Addie Bag-
garly and Elin Esborn, senior 
Marta Perez, sophomore Clara 
Manzalini and freshman Marina 
Escobar.
The 54-hole tournament will 
take place from Friday through 
Sunday at the 6,130-yard, par 71 
Stanford Golf Course.

A pair of Florida’s top-ranked men’s 
tennis players advanced to the second 
round of the ITA All-American Champi-
onships in Tulsa, Oklahoma. 
No. 3 Oliver Crawford and No. 10 
Sam Riffice both handled their oppo-
nents in singles play, while Johannes 
Ingildsen and Brian Berdusco moved 
on to the round of 16 in doubles play. 
Crawford, the tournament’s No. 2 seed, 
had a commanding 6-3 first set win over 
Aditya Vashistha of St. John’s before the 
match was postponed due to rain. After 
the delay and moving indoors, Crawford 
dropped the second set 6-3, leading to a 
decisive third set. 
Florida’s top-ranked player answered 
by blanking Vashistha, defeating him 6-0 
in the third set and advancing to the next 
round.
Riffice, the tournament’s No. 6 seed, 
needed just two sets to defeat Notre Dame’s Richard Ciamarra. The Orlando 
native had no problem taking down No. 
43 Ciamarra, winning in straight sets 6-3, 
7-5 performance to advance to the next 
day.
The No. 4 ranked duo of Ingildsen and 
Berdusco, the tournament’s No. 3 seed, 
were able to hold off comeback attempts 
in both sets from Radford’s Rodrigo 
Magalhaes and Yevhen Sirous, defeating 
them in a straight 7-5, 7-5 win.
The Gators pair is the only one that 
will represent the team in the quarterfi-
nals, as No. 49 Riffice and Crawford fell 
to Illinois’ No. 19 Alex Brown and Aleks 
Kovacevic 7-5, 6-4. 
Florida finished the day 2-1 in singles 
play after No. 70 Lukas Greif lost to No. 
13 Juan Carlos Aguilar of Texas A&M, 
while UF’s doubles teams split an even 
record of 1-1.

thoseTigersbwith at least 30 total attacks and leads the 
team in kills. HPAA uses both to determine 
that, while Hall’s hitting percentage isn’t that 
great, she is still an effective player in the at-
tack. 
However, the problem is that UF doesn’t 
have any truly elite players, either. Hall is 
20th in the conference, with Carlton and 
Dooley not too far behind at 22nd and 28th, 
respectively. 
HPAA per match gives similar results: Six 
Florida players are still in the top 40, but only 
Hall is in the top 20. Carlton (22nd), Kramer 
(23rd), Dooley (26th) and Dooley (27th) are 
in the top 30. 
“They don’t really have anyone right now 
getting to that next level,” Alan said in a text. 
“I think Thayer Hall can be that player but 
hitting 25 percent isn’t quite enough to get 
her there. I know she doesn’t always get the 
best looks, but I’d really like to see that num-
ber go up at least a bit.”
He also added, “She’s a great player, she’s 
only a sophomore, and she’s got all the talent 
to become a dominant player in the SEC.”
That’s a real problem that Florida faces. 
The Gators have played matches against 
Stanford, which has three of the Pac-12’s 
top 10 players in HPAA per match (includ-
ing Kathryn Plummer, who is second in the 
Pac-12), Kentucky, which has two of the con-ference’s top-10 players in HPAA per match, 
and Northern Arizona, whose Abby Akin is 
12th in the country in HPAA per match. 
In those three matches, the Gators are 1-2, 
with their sole win coming against an other-
wise overmatched Northern Arizona squad. 
Not having a player who can consistently 
take over a match can kill them in both SEC 
play and come tournament time.
Another interesting result from HPAA per 
match is that there wasn’t much of a differ-
ence between Florida’s three middle block-
ers. Early on in the season, UF started King 
and senior Rachael Kramer, then went with 
King and Dooley when Kramer was injured. 
Now the Gators are primarily using Kramer 
and Dooley. 
On the offensive side, there doesn’t seem 
to be much of a difference. Kramer has the 
highest HPAA per match (1.49), but Dooley 
(1.41) and King (1.36) aren’t too far behind. 
Any differences between the three players 
likely lies in their defensive play.  
Bonus facts: Former UF players Rhamat 
Alhassan, Alex Holston and Kelly Murphy 
have three of the four highest career HPAAs 
in the SEC since 2009. All three are also in the 
top 40 in the NCAA in that span, with Alhas-
san in seventh place.

37 points a game.
Hawaii will lean on him 
for success as it has all sea-
son. And the only one who 
can stop McDonald is him-
self.
In Hawaii’s one loss, he 
threw three interceptions 
and was held to a season-
low 218 yards against a 
determined Washington 
defense in the lopsided 52-
20 defeat. He'll need to take 
care of the ball but shouldn’t 
have much trouble against a 
Boise State defense that has 
just three interceptions this 
season.
The Hawaii defense, 
however, will have its 
hands full against the Bron-
cos, who come into the 
matchup averaging 32.6 
points per game led by 
freshman quarterback Hank 
Bachmeier. The young 
quarterback likes to spread 
the ball around, and the UH 
secondary may have a long 
day if it can’t keep up with 
Boise State’s talented receiv-
ing corps — which has ﬁ  ve 
players with over 150 yards 
this season — in check.
With two high-ﬂ  ying of-
fenses, the game is shaping 
up to be another shootout. 
And there’s nothing that 
suits the Rainbow Warriors 
better.

Boise State (-12.5) will 
win because…
The Broncos actu-
ally have a blue ﬁ  eld. I’m 
looking at you, Cincinnati 
Bearcats, with your teased 
black ﬁ  eld, that would’ve 
been pretty cool. But no, the only colored football ﬁ  eld 
in the country is located in 
Boise, Idaho, and the foot-
ball team that plays on it 
has a stout offense.
Led by quarterback 
Hank Bachmeier, who is 
among the nation’s leaders 
in passing yards with 1,489 
on the year, Boise State av-
erages 32.6 points per game. 
Unfortunately for the Bron-
cos, he’s nowhere near the 
top of the country in the 
touchdown department, 
having thrown only eight in 
ﬁ  ve games.
The two-headed rush-
ing attack complements the 
passing game nicely. George 
Halani and Robert Mahone 
both have 300 yards on the 
ground this season on better 
than three yards per carry.
Since beating Florida 
State in Tallahassee, the 
Broncos have met little com-
petition, mowing through 
their non-Power 5 school 
slate. Hawaii, however, 
has beaten two Power 5 
teams this season already in 
Arizona and Oregon State. 
Boise State, the UCF of this 
season, is in desperate need 
of a win with the FPI clout 
to vault it into its top 10. If 
the right teams in the top 
10 fall and the Broncos take 
care of business, they could 
ﬁ  nd themselves in the same 
position as the Knights the 
past few years. That’s moti-
vation enough to show out 
against the Rainbow War-
riors.

Now onto the picks…
There’s a tie for ﬁ  rst 
this week at 33-14. Up ﬁ  rst 
is Kyle “Too Good For 
‘Friends’” Wood. It’s ﬁ  ne, Kyle. I respect the fact you 
have a distaste for one of 
the most popular television 
shows of all time. Your ha-
tred for the beloved series 
goes with the theme of your 
life, honestly. I mean, you 
skipped out on an entire 
copy editing shift last week 
on a wrap night, nonethe-
less. Maybe you need more 
“friends” in your life, in 
both spectrums. It’s ﬁ  ne, 
Kyle.
Also leading is Tyler “I 
Refuse To Show My Love 
For My Student News-
paper” Nettuno. Tyler, it 
really hurt when you said 
you would not abide by 
the longstanding tradition 
to get the trademarked Al-
ligator “a” tattoo after your 
time at our beloved student 
newspaper. I really believe 
you need to take some time 
to rethink this. How many 
college graduates can say 
they’ve had the honor to 
brand themselves with a let-
ter that signiﬁ  es so much? 
C’mon Ethan Bauer, help 
me out here.
There’s another two-way 
tie for second at 30-17, led 
off by Mark “Millennials, 
Man” Long. Mark over-
heard a young woman com-
plaining that she couldn’t 
buy a ticket on Saturday be-
cause “none of them would 
take Venmo” and decided 
to take his frustrations out 
on an entire generation. Get 
with the times, Mark. It’s 
2019, no one carries around 
a checkbook anymore.
