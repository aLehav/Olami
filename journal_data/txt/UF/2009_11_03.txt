UF gets 1,000
HINI vaccines
By THOMAS STEWART
Alligator Staff Writer
tstewa rt@alligator org
UF received its first batch of HINI vaccines for students
Monday afternoon.
The Student Health Care Clinic was given 1,000 doses of the
nasal spray form of the vaccine -800 of which are for students
only -from the Alachua County Health Department, said Kat
Lindsey, SHCC marketing coordinator.
The remaining 200 doses are for students, faculty and staff
who care for children six months or younger, including work-
ers at Baby Gator, Lindsey said.
Students need to sign up online at
U F shcc.ufl.edu/hlnl/ for an appoint-
Administration ment to get the free vaccine. Appoint-
ments are first come, first served.
Appointments will be available on Wednesday from 9 a.m.
to 4 p.m. at the infirmary, with 50 spots available every half
hour. Lindsey said she expects the appointments to fill up
quickly.
Students are required to present their Gator 1 Cards to get
the vaccine and are asked to print and fill out a medical ques-
tionnaire from the UF Web site before coming in.
Students must be 25 or younger to receive the vaccine. Those
who are pregnant or have chronic medical conditions should
not get the nasal spray form of the vaccine, according to the UF
Web site.
Lindsey said she has no idea when UF will receive more
doses of the vaccine.
UF has requested about 45,000 doses. The university was
given about 600 doses of the injectable form of the vaccine
for health care workers in specific departments last month.

Student reports man
watching porn in library
By THOMAS STEWART
Alligator Staff Writer
tstewart@alligator org
A 21-year-old man was banned from
campus last week after a UF student re-
ported that he was looking at porn and
masturbating while using a computer at
Library West.
The student told police that the man,
Chrisopher E. Wallace, did not expose
himself but had his left hand in his pants
and appeared to be masturbating, accord-
ing to a police report.
The witness said she didn't report the
original incident in late September but
made sure to report it when she saw himat the library again last week.
When officers arrived, they did not
find him looking at porn, but, because
he had no connection to UF, they banned
him from campus. The ban is effective for
three years.
A phone number listed for Wallace
was not in service on Monday afternoon.
The incident is not the first in which a
man has been accused of masturbating in
a UF library.
In January of 2008, Gene Walker
Moore, 41 at the time, was charged with
exposure of sexual organs after two stu-
dents saw him masturbating in the Nor-
man Hall library, according to a Univer-
sity Police Department news release.

Fest goer arrested for
spitting on officer
A 19-year-old woman in town
for The Fest was arrested on cam-
pus Saturday for spitting on a Uni-
versity Police Department officer.
Alyson McEvoy, of Port Or-
ange, Fla., was charged with bat-
tery of a law enforcement officer.
She was approached by officers
at the McCarty Hall bus stop Satur-
day afternoon in response to a re-
port of a woman acting strangely.
While being questioned, McE-
voy called one of the officers a
"douche bag" and another "black
man" and "blackie," according to
a police report. She then spit on
one of the officers.
"She cleared her throat and
brought a mouthful of spit into
her mouth," the officer's statement
reads. "She leaned towards me
and looked into my face. Then she
spit directly at me."
The spit landed on the officer's
shirt and pants, the report stated.
McEvoy, who admitted to officers
that she had been drinking, blew a
.27, more than three times the legal
driving limit, when given a breath-
alyzer test.
Contacted by phone Monday,
McEvoy said she doesn't remem-
ber much from that afternoon be-
cause of how drunk she was but
said she regretted spitting on the
officer. "I feel bad," she said. "I
mean, I've never spit on anyone in
my life. I don't know where that
came from."
Early the next morning, in an
unrelated incident, four men were
arrested for battery of a law en-
forcement officer after allegedly
beating an officer at a Fest after-
party in northwest Gainesville.

Military sees jump in recruitment due to recession
By ANDREW NORRIS
Alligator Contributing Writer
The job market is down, but
Travis Thibeault isn't worried.
When the UF sophomore gradu-
ates, he has a steady job, good pay
and benefits waiting for him.
Thibeault hasn't unlocked some
secret to life, but like an increasing
number of college-age students,
he's enlisted in the military.
What was at one time a career
path reserved for few has become
many Americans' answer to the
faltering economy.
"I tell everyone when they ask
me why I joined the Air Force thatnot only do I want to serve my
country, but when you're in the
military in any branch you always
have a job and a paycheck on the
first and 15th of every month," he
said.
After enlisting in the Air Force
Reserve when he graduated from
high school, Thibeault joined UF's
Air Force ROTC. At the end of his
four years, he'll become a commis-
sioned officer.
For Thibeault, the decision to
enlist and join ROTC was an easy
one.
"There's no doubt in my mind
that this is the right thing for me to
do," said Thibeault, whose father
was also in the Air Force. "If col-lege doesn't work out, I always tell
myself that I'll be in boot camp the
next day."
"There's no doubt in my
mind that this is the right
thing for me to do."
Travis Thibeault
UF sophomore
For the 2009 fiscal year, every
branch of the military reported re-
cruitment numbers that either met
or exceeded their goal.
The armed forces have even
seen in increase of interest from
older generations; in 2006 theArmy changed its enlistment age
limit from 35 to 42.
"Because of the economy and
a lot of people losing jobs, people
want job security and health care,"
said 1st Lt. Sean Norres, an officer
strength manager for the Army.
Recruiting quotas were met
within the first few weeks of the
year, quickly satiating the armed
forces' need for more than 300,000
new recruits each year.
"We've actually had to put re-
strictions on the amount of people
we could recruit," he said. "There's
been such a big over strength in
the Army as a whole that instead
of quantity it went to quality."
Norres, who works with theUF Army ROTC, said numbers
for ROTC have also increased dra-
matically.
"The seniors are only at 20 (ca-
dets), and the freshman class is at
60," he said. "Every year it increas-
es probably by 15 or 20."
Students who participate in a
commissioning program, like Thi-
beault, are eligible to have their tu-
ition paid for, a book stipend and a
monthly stipend that can be used
for anything.
"People are looking around
now for different avenues to pay
for college," Norres said. "People
that would have never noticed the
Army or ROTC now see the appeal
of enlisting."
Students voice concerns over new course-drop policy
0 DROPPED COURSES WILL NOT BE
COVERED BY BRIGHT FUTURES.
By ALISON CLARK
Alligator Contributing Writer
With the Nov. 23 deadline for dropping
a class this fall, students with Bright Futures
scholarships are concerned about having to
pay for classes they drop.
This is the first semester that the Florida
Bright Futures Scholarship Program, which
aids more than 28,000 UF students, has
changed its guidelines, making students re-
fund their institution the cost of any droppedor withdrawn Bright Futures-funded course,
said Ron Anderson, associate director of train-
ing and development for Student Financial
Affairs.
This time of the year is when classes be-
come more difficult, and some students need
to drop a class or want to in fear of lowering
their GPAs. With the new guidelines taking ef-
fect this semester, any class dropped after the
drop-add period will have to be paid for.
Exceptions will be based on a verifiable ill-
ness or emergency beyond the student's con-
trol. The exception will only be cleared with a
recommendation by the financial aid office at
the student's university.
Stephanie Ellis, postdoctoral employeeat the UF Counseling Center, said the center
will occasionally write letters of support for
students who want to withdraw from the se-
mester.
"However, it's very rare that we just do
it for one class. We do this when something
traumatic happens, such as after the death of
a family member, serious
U F mental health issues or a
Academics pregnancy," Ellis said.
Patrick Piper, adminis-
trative services coordinator at UF's Financial
Services, said students who fail to pay the
university back will be notified that he or she
owes debt and could eventually be sent to col-
lections."I don't like the changes at all," said UF
sophomore Chelsea Burns. "I worry about
every little grade I get not because I plan on
dropping every class that throws an obstacle
at me, but because I know I don't have that op-
tion to drop."
Sophia Carballosa, a sophomore, said she
would rather take a bad grade than make her
family pay money for a class she had to drop,
even if it might look bad on her GPA.
Anderson reminds students to take precau-
tions prior to registration in order to prevent
problems with the new guidelines.
"Seek good academic advising. If a class is
not your cup of tea, be honest with yourself,"
Anderson said.

Students tan more despite risk
Increase seen in winter
By LAURA MONTALTO
Alligator Contributing Writer
Despite a growing stigma
surrounding tanning beds and
recent studies comparing the
dangers of tanning to tobacco,
hepatitis B and arsenic gas,
Gators are still getting their
golden glow on this fall.
As the holiday season nears,
tanning salons like LAE Tan-
ning & Boutique are becoming
more popular because students
feel pressure to look good for
holiday parties, visits home
and football games. Owner
Kelley Anderson said LAE has
seen business increase dramat-
ically.
Anderson said the increase
begins in October and lasts
through spring break.
The busiest months are Jan-
uary and February because the
sun is out the least then, she
said.
But tanning beds aren't the
only way Gators get a glow.
Mandi Nazaro, owner of
Golden Gator Spray Tanning,
said since the store first opened
about three years ago, the start
of the holiday season has al-
ways brought more customers
in, especially Halloween, when
people are preparing to dress
in skimpy costumes.
Nazaro said that during

p.m. to accommodate the in-
flux of tanners.
I have never been in
a tanning bed or had a
spray tan. They don't ap-
peal to me because I am
not sure how safe they
are. They seem dirty, and
I don't want ultraviolet
rays hitting my skin so
intensely."
Lauren Vargas
UF junior
Appointments normally
stop at around 8:30 p.m. dur-
ing the rest of the year.
"During our summer and
not-so-busy months, we only
get half as many appointments
as we do in the wintertime,"
she said. "When your demo-
graphic is about 80 percent
college-aged girls, you are al-
ways going to have more peo-
ple come in around this time of
year."
But Lauren Vargas, a junior
from Miami Beach, does not
see the appeal in any form of
tanning.
"I have never been in a tan-ling bed or had a spray tan,"
Vargas said. "They don't ap-
peal to me because I am not
sure how safe they are. They
seem dirty, and I don't want
ultraviolet rays hitting my skin
so intensely."
She added that the reason
she thinks there is such an in-
crease in the use of tanning fa-
cilities in the winter is because
it is the only way to get dark
once the summer months have
gone.
As popular as tanning
around this time of the year
may be, excessive amounts can
lead to melanoma, wrinkles
and first-degree burns, said
Dr. Richard Sadove, plastic
surgeon at Dermacare Laser 
&
Skin Care Clinics.
Melanoma, a type of skin
cancer, is one of the most dan-
gerous side effects of tanning
because it can spread and be-
come deeper and more lethal.
An increased risk of skin
cancer has to do with constant
exposure to ultraviolet radia-
tion over time, Sadove said.
Sadove explained that while
a tan used to be associated with
wealth, beauty and fashion,
that is not longer the case.
"Tanning may be popular
in youth, but wrinkles are not
popular in old age," Sadove
said.
"It may be a fashion issue,
but skin cancer isn't."

Public Porn
Students should report
lewd behavior
In September, UF spent about $3,500 to install hand sanitizers
on campus. Hopefully Library West is well stocked, because
they're about to experience a sharp increase in demand.
Christopher Wallace, 21, was banned from campus last week
after police say he was masturbating while looking at porn on a
Library West computer. He was served a trespass warning, and
said he would not return.
On the bright side, your next wait for a free computer might
be less mundane than usual. Watching someone waste com-
puter time writing Facebook messages or beating their all-time
high score in Tetris has never seemed so appealing.
Sadly, this is not the first incident of its kind. In January 2008,
a 41-year-old Gainesville resident was accused of masturbating
in the Education Library at Norman Hall.
Police filed charges of exposure of sexual organs and tres-
pass after warning. We hope Mr. Wallace's warning is more ef-
fective.
Wchile the sheer absurdity of these acts and the cleanliness of
Library West keyboards might be the first things that come to
mind, the real issue is how to ensure the safety of students on
such a large, porous campus.
Anyone with their pants on can walk into a UF library (what
happens to their pants after entering is another story). Strict se-
curity measures are costly and a hassle to students. But there are
some inexpensive, commonsense solutions.
If someone is using school resources inappropriately, report
them.
While the student who reported Mr. Wallace did so only
after the fact, we commend her for taking any action at all. A
man masturbating in a room full of strangers is bound to draw
attention from more than one student, and it is everyone's re-
sponsibility to help protect the safety of their peers.
Death Beds
Withwinter approach-ing, sunny skies
give way to pale
thighs for some UF students.
But many trying to hold on to
that elusive summer tan take
excessive risks to retain it.
Local tanning salons see a
huge surge inbusiness around
this time every year. The ex-
posed limbs of scantily clad
Halloween partygoers don't
tan themselves, you know.
So to complement that
short skirt or low-cut dress
with a summer glow, why not
hop into a bed of arsenic?
Stepping into a tanning
bed might be just as bad, ac-
cording to an Alligator article
published on Aug. 4. Cancer
experts have declared them to
be as dangerous as exposure
to arsenic gas.
Looking good is impor-
tant, but cancer (especially
life-threatening melanoma)
and wrinkles later in life are
not worth a fleeting glow.A World Health Organiza-
tion report shows that the risk
of skin cancer increases by 75
percent for those using tan-
ning beds before age 30.
Because long-term side ef-
fects aren't effective in scaring
some people away from these
salons, think about that unfor-
tunate baked-turkey look you
can get if you overdo it.
We know Thanksgiving is
only three weeks away, but it's
a little early to be basting any-

sound grim (and pasty), but
there is a reason they call it a
summer tan.
If you're still desperate, try
spray-tanning. It might leave
you looking like a pumpkin

loween -but at least you'll

We believe UF students
need to tough it out and wait
for spring break to bust out
that turkey baster, or rather,
that bottle of tanning oil.

Social media emphasize individuality
D o you remember LiveJournal?LiveJournal is a hybrid blogging and social net-
working service started by Brad Fitzpatrick in 1999.
Users could create a blog that usually served as a public di-
ary, and then they could add people they know who also set
up LiveJournal blogs as "friends." Friends' blog entries are
aggregated on a single page, allowing users to see at a glance
what their buddies are up to, like a proto-News Feed.
The service was many people's first experience with a
Web 2.0 application, and, in particular, the first for many
teens. LiveJournal quickly acquired a reputation as a clear-
inghouse for suburban, adolescent angst -collections of
lengthy, startlingly sincere lamentations of broken hearts,
occasionally interspersed with awful, copied-and-pasted
Dashboard Confessional lyrics and "Which 'Hey Arnold!'
Character Are You?" quizzes. (I always shot for Gerald, but
I'd always wind up being Eugene -or, on a good day, Mr.
Hyunh. This was a source of mild consternation.)
LiveJournal was, in many ways, a forerunner of much
of the purportedly revolutionary social media environment
we're in right now. After all, it was started before the word
"blog" was even coined and before the phrase "Web 2.0"
gained any sort of currency, and it predates both MySpace
and Facebook by about half a decade.
It was also among the first social media to receive the
same flak that Facebook and Twitter catch on a regular basis
now. You know the criticism: It's narcissistic. It's self-impor-
tant. Nobody really cares how hilarious your cat looks when
he's asleep.
But I've never thought that the self-absorption was what
we were supposed to take away from social media. And I'll
go as far as to say, without any irony, that LiveJournal and its
successors have made me sort of a better person.
The most important thing LiveJournal did for me -and
I say this as someone who never actually kept one -was
serve as a reminder that everybody is living their own lives.
That's kind of tautological and not anything revelatory, but itJoe Dellosa
Ietters@a lIigator orgwas useful: It's one thing to be aware
of that as an abstract concept, but it's
another thing to see it in action -to
see heartfelt and emotionally complex
outpourings of hopes, dreams and in-
securities spill onto the Internet from
people who you've mentally filed
away as that kid who "sort of is a jack-
ass" or "seems like kind of a slut."
That's what I believe the take-
away from social media is supposed to be: The people in
our lives are not just characters in our own story, and that
everybody, in fact, has their own story -their own aspira-
tions, their own joys and fears, their own private battles that
they're quietly fighting. And for every person about whom
you probably don't really give a damn, there's probably a
parent who wants desperately for their kid to be happy or a
person whose heart is getting broken at the news that their
best friend is having a rough day.
We don't have to think that everybody has an absolutely
fascinating life story for which Ira Glass must be summoned
to record. But we should at least remember that everybody
does have a story, and we should respect that.
LiveJournal is now a living vestige of the early Web 2.0
era -it still exists, but there are tons of other services on the
Internet that can do everything it does better and more eas-
ily, and with less ugly advertising. In fact, the service, once
on the verge of seeming indispensable to both Internet and
teen culture, wound up being sold to a Russian company in
2007.
But its legacy lives on -not just in trivial updates on
what someone had for lunch on Twitter or very awkward,
very public breakups that play out on Facebook, but in the
understanding and compassion that all that nonsense is,
weirdly and inexplicably enough, supposed to inspire.

Letters to the Editor
Coverage should have included police
reactions at similar parties
In regards to your article covering Sun-
day morning's violent incident involving
Fest goers and local police, I find it extreme-
ly interesting that the only perspective on
the incident was from the police.
Fairer coverage of the night's events
would have included the fact that an iden-
tically loud and well-attended party the
night before was effectively policed by a
half dozen officers employing civility and
tact, who rightfully solicited the assistance
of the party's hosts in getting hundreds of
kids safely out of the street and the party
under control.
That a smaller number of officers chose to
respond to a similar situation the following
night by immediately arresting and Taser-
ing drunken but ultimately non-violent par-
ty goers seems to me to be the hallmark of
stupidity. Who wouldn't have foreseen the
violence that followed such an unnecessary
use of force?
Unfortunately, it seems as if this incident
will be used as an excuse to waste even more
taxpayer money to "control" what is alreadya beautifully self-regulating c
event. To me, this is just ano
ample of how police, throug
competence, create the justific
over-inflated budgets.

In the past few months, political factions in Washington,
D.C., have become even more pronounced, and most of the

One of the first instances of this divide happened during
President Obama's speech to Congress on the issue of health
care. Representative Joe Wilson made a fool of himself and
his entire party with his racially motivated outburst. I think
political outbursts have their place in our government, but
not during a speech that is traditionally respected by every-
one in Congress, regardless of party affiliation. This was the
first time I have seen someone yelling during an internation-

It gets worse. Since then, the Republicans have launched

Speaking Out care have been highlighted, but manyothers haven't been discussed.
The Republicans decided to hate
ACORN when they found out that it had some sort of re-
lationship with President Obama. So, naturally, when two
ACORN employees were filmed talking about breaking a
law to help out a seemingly poor woman that was simply
trying to support herself in life, the Republicans called for
the organization's government funding to be cut. Despite
the fact that ACORN helps countless families and individu-
als who need assistance every year, the organization was
judged based on two employees.
Had the Republicans consistently held the view that a
few employees are representative of a huge organization, it
would have been fine. But consider the case of Jamie Leigh
Jones, the woman who said she was gang-raped by Halli-
burton employees. She wasn't allowed to sue the company
based on a contractual loophole, and when this came up inCongress, the Republicans shifted their views completely.
Instead of supporting the Al Franken anti-rape amend-
ment to the government contract, 30 out of 38 Republicans
said that the government shouldn't meddle with its own
contracts, and that the government shouldn't judge an orga-
nization like Halliburton based on a few employees.
Now, Republican Congressmen are again showing their
disconnect with the people they were elected to serve. Not
only are they reserving support for debate over the health-
care bill (even though polls show that Americans want the
public option), but they are also still saying the stimulus
package was a bust. Granted, on health care at least, some
Democrats have to get their act together and at least vote to
debate the issue.
Thankfully, Republican governors like Arnold
Schwarzenegger are actually in touch with their people and
can admit that the stimulus is working. The Republicans in
Congress could learn a thing or two from the Governator.

After Meth
ByCJ PRUNER
Alligator Writer
The eyes of Donna Gail Weeks tell a
storyIh at could rip the toughest leather
binding. The whites, chiseled with scrag-
gy red lines, contain two emp ty black
holes that seem to yearn for a world be-
yond the forbidding confines of prison
walls, where she will spend the next 6
1/2 years.
The clanging bar doors only reflect a
cold reality.
"It's a slow hell," she said.
For Weeks, 44, the road to hell has
been paved with years of fast and loose
decisions piled onto a broken spirit.
"I've had to shut myself out from pre-
tending the outside world is there," she
said. "It's hard."
Before her arrest, she worked as an
attorney's legal assistant, striving to pro-
vide a stable home for her daughter, Sier-
ra, and enough money to be able to hold
her head high at the end of the day -all
without any run-ins with the law.
Although she experimented with co-
caine in her early 20s, she grew tired of
it. She found God, went to church and
stayed clean for 10 years.
But a string of broken relationships,
combined with a poisonous mindset of
never feeling good enough, made her
turn to an even more poisonous solution
-meth. What started as a weekend habit
with a boyfriend morphed into a near-
daily habit that feasted on her bankroll,
consuming anywhere from $80 to $300
dollars a week.
"I'd sit there knowing I had to pay
rent or pay bills, but the addiction is so
strong," she said.
As powerful as the addiction was,
Weeks swore she would never expose
her daughter to her dark secret. Howev-
er, when Sierra, then a pre-teen, noticed
something wrapped in tin foil near the
sink, she was on the verge of a nervous
breakdown.
Her mother told her it was for burning
incense. Sierra didn't believe her.
"That was rock bottom, losing my
daughter," Weeks said.
Lonely and helpless, it seemed that the
drug that had taken so much from her
was the only thing that could give her
any relief.
Then one afternoon in 2001, Todd
Brown, a childhood friend of Weeks'
boss, walked into the office. Though he
was a multiple drug offender, he didn't
fit the profile of a criminal: He had a fain-ily, was respectful to peers and kept a
clean appearance. Eventually, Weeks fell
for him.
Although Brown told her he loved her,
she was convinced he loved meth more.
"He always told me he loved me, but
I always asked him, 'How do you know
this? Because every time you have said
that, you've always been on meth,"' she
said
Their love for the drug became so pow-
erful that they looked for ways to cut out
the middleman. With very little income,
Brown turned to Weeks to support his
drug habit. They cooked the drug using
ingredients including Sudafed, drainage
fluid and lithium strips.
However, it was the anhydrous am-
monia, a substance used in fertilizer, that
turned meth into mind-altering dyna-
mite. Brown knew of a farm out in Alach-
ua where there were tanks of anhydrous
ammonia that were, seemingly, easy to
plunder. Weeks was hesitant about the
attempt, but on Feb. 1, they made their
way to the meth mecca.
Weeks was to drop Brown off, circle
around a few times and come back when
he had filled up the tank. But as she pulled
up to pick up Brown, red and blue lights
flashed in the rearview mirror.
"You got
to go!" Brown
yelled. Weeks
slammed the
pedal and
blazed through
the night.
"We have
to stop!" she
pleaded to
Brown, who
was throwing
anything sus-
picious out the
car window.
It wasn't
enough to save
them.
But despite
the conse-
quences, Weeks
believes that
getting caught
served some
benefit.
"I think this
is God's way
of getting my
attention," she Todd Brown, who was a
said. "I'm glad ent used to make meth

Todd Brown doesn't miss methamphet-
amine.
Since February, he has been in the Dixie
County Jail, where getting his hands on meth
would be nearly impossible. But Brown, 47,
wants nothing to do with the drug that he
admitted in court to loving more than his
family.
Brown is what law enforcement officers
call a career criminal, but he wasn't always
considered so dangerous to society that a
judge may be forced to lock him up for life.
Raised in Thomasville, Ga., Brown went
through nearly four decades without touch-
ing anything harder than marijuana and
alcohol. When he got married in the early
1980s, he stopped smoking and embraced
the idea of family life.
He coached little league and made sure
his kids had what they needed. As he neared
40, though, he fell in with people who used
meth, a drug he had never tried.
"At first I didn't mess with it," he said.
"Then I tried it -I shouldn't have -and it's
been downhill ever since."
But his first hit of meth -or any hit after
that -wasn't a sweet, dizzy pleasure that
left every nerve
aching for more.
"I didn't like
it all," he said. "It
kept me up for a
couple days."
Brown's first
taste didn't make
him an addict.
A year later, he
poured most of
his savings into
an auto repair
business, but in-
spectors told him
he would have to
wait more than
a year to operate
because of zon-
ing.
"I said to my-
self, 'I can't stay
here and make
no money,' he
said. So he ran

)drug he knew would keep him alert through
long nights.
"I bought some from [a friend], and there
it went," he said.
Within a month, Brown was spending
$1,000 a week on meth, and what started out
as a twice-daily habit became something that
consumed him once an hour.
"It was everything," he said. "All day
long."
Soon, maintaining the high became too
expensive, and Brown began cooking meth
in the woods with a friend who showed him
how to make it with anhydrous ammonia.
"We couldn't do it inside," he said. "We
wouldn't be able to breathe. That stuff'll
knock you down."
After nine months of using, Brown be-
gan a spiral of arrests that would drag him
through probation, jail, rehab and finally
federal prison.
Although he was no longer making meth-
amphetamine, jail time and rehab couldn't
dampen the romance between Brown and
his drug.
While packing after an 18-month stay in
a rehab clinic, Brown found about a gram
of meth -less than a day's high. He took
a hit and confessed to his sponsor, and the
find from his jacket pocket landed him an
11-month stay in federal prison.
He was released in January of 2009, and
was almost immediately getting high in the
bathroom of a halfway house.
Less than a month later, he and Weeks
were caught after leading police on ecstasy-
frenzied chase.
Since February, Brown has waited. He
began taking anti-depressants after a mental-
health evaluation determined that he suffers
from bipolar disorder and thinks the medi-
cine will help keep him clean when -if -
he is released.
For now, Brown waits for the axe to fall
and determine the rest of his life. He reflects
on his tenure as a drug addict, during which
he chose to forsake his family in favor of a
destructive drug and a woman meth made
him believe he loved more than his wife.
But despite the urge to fight for his fam-
ily, Brown refuses to let his wife be married
to a prisoner forever.
"I've told her if I get another 10 or 15,
I'm going to file for divorce," he said. " She
needs to go on and get over me."
Inconsistent with the drug addict
who cried "rock bottom," Brown is say-
ing it for the first time now after eight
years of destruction at the hands of a
monster named methamphetamine.
"I went from Disney world and family va-
cations to a dopehead," he said. "It's quick.
You go down real quick."
Don't be chicken.

Boynton shines in UF exhibition rout
U HE HAD 22 POINTS IN HIS
COLLEGE DEBUT.
By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
aberry@alligator org
As a highly touted recruit who played
in more than his fair share of high school
all-star games, Kenny Boynton was no
stranger to the spotlight before making his
Florida debut.
But even with plenty of experience
playing in big games in packed arenas, the
freshman guard still felt nervous before his
first college game.
He overcame the pregame jitters quick- -
ly, scoring a game-high 22 points in his
debut for the Gators to lead UF past Divi-
sion-Il Saint Leo 95-46 in Florida's opening
exhibition game in O'Connell Center on
Monday night.
Heralded as the team's savior and an
elite scorer before coming to Gainesville,
Boynton lived up to the expectations with
a hot start, scoring the first five points of
the game on a fast-break layup and a cor-
ner three.
"To tell you the truth, I was nervous be-
cause I didn't know how I was gonna feel
when I got out there," Boynton said. "But
I got the first point, and after that I just
played my game."
Whether driving through the lane or
bombing threes from all over the floor,
Boynton proved to be UF's go-to scoring
option in front of a crowd of 8,804 that
included his mother, father, siblings and
friends. He shot 50 percent from the floor
and was 5 of 9 from beyond the arc.
Although his true strength is his abil-
ity to score, Boynton added six rebounds, Andrew Stanfill / Alligator Staff

Home crowd gets glimpse of four new Gators
First impressions are important in arelationship.
Sure, they're often misleading,
shallow or even outright wrong, but it al-
ways helps to get off on the right foot.
The new members of Florida's men's
basketball program introduced them-
selves to Gators fans Monday in the first
exhibition game against Saint Leo, with
mixed impressions left for their future re-
lationships in Gainesville.
Freshman guard Kenny Boynton
looked every bit the scorer he was touted
as coming out of Plantation American
Heritage High. He was quick to get out
and run, knocked down five of his nine
3-point shots and led the team with 22
points.Kyle Maistri
Kyle Points
kmaistri@alligator orgThere's a lot of
pressure on Boyn-
ton's shoulders to
elevate his new
teammates' level of
play, and while he
showed nothing to
suggest he will be a
relentless defensive
stopper, the guy can
flat-out rip the net.
And his teammates trust him already.
"He always does that, so it was noth-
ing really unexpected for us," junior pow-
er forward Alex Tyus said. "He's a great
player."
In addition to Boynton, freshman Erik
Murphy was rock solid in his debut inthe Orange and Blue. The 6-foot-9 power
forward looks a lot bigger than the 217
pounds the team's Web site lists him at -
in a good way. He gave UF solid minutes
off the bench and was comfortable bang-
ing down low, pulling down six rebounds
in 17 minutes.
Boynton stole the crowd's heart with
his dynamic play, but Murphy sure ap-
pears to be a much-needed reliable post
player starting now.
"Kenny Boynton, a freshman, and
Erik Murphy, a freshman, they're ready,"
starting point guard Erving Walker said.
"They're prepared."
The last first-year player to get in the
game was "Hot" Rod Tishman, the 6-foot-

Teams Player of the Week.LB Spikes
suspended
for first half
By PHIL KEGLER
Alligator Staff Writer
pkeger@a Iigator org
Starting middle linebacker Brandon
Spikes has been suspended for the first
half of Saturday's Vanderbilt game,
Florida coach Urban Meyer announced
Monday.
The move came two days after Spikes
appeared to eye-gouge Georgia running
back Washaun Ealey in a pile during the
Gators' 41-17 win.
No penalty was called during the
game, but Spikes was caught putting his
finger in Ealey's face mask on CBS cam-
eras, and the video was quickly posted
all over the Internet.
"I don't condone that, and I un-
derstand what goes on in football, but
there's no place for
that," Meyer said.
"That's not who he is.
That's not who we are.
He got caught up in
emotion. I love Bran-
don Spikes, and our
team does (too). We're
Spikes going to move on, but
he has our full sup-
port."Saturday's game was filled with chip-
py behavior between Florida and Geor-
gia players. Five personal fouls were
called during the game -three on the
Bulldogs and two on the Gators.
"I don't think that we did anything
in that game that they didn't do," quar-
terback Tim Tebow said. "If you go back
and look at it and study it, you can see
on the film, too."
Meyer did not see film of Spikes'
play in the pile until Monday morning.
His wife mentioned it to him Sunday
night, and defensive coordinator Char-
lie Strong brought it up the following
morning.
He didn't think it was a big deal until
he finally saw it. Meyer spoke to Spikes
about the incident and suspension Mon-
day morning before announcing it.
"The thing he needs to know is we all
understand the game of football," Meyer
said. "Some of us have played it. Things
happened in that game in particular that

5 Israeli point guard.
He's obviously not going to get
significant minutes right away as
he adjusts to the American style of
play and coach Billy Donovan's sys-
tem -if you looked hard enough,
you could see him think in between
dribbles. Still, his size is a plus, and
he might be able to develop into a
facilitator off the bench for Boynton
and Tyus.
The trio of freshmen were impres-
sive, but not everyone left a good
taste in the collective mouth of the
O'Connell Center faithful.
Redshirt junior transfer Vernon
Macklin is going to have to make up
for a lackluster first showing.
The 6-foot-10 center played soft
and was anything but the monster in
the middle Florida was hoping for.
He didn't block a single shot
against the much smaller Lions and
pulled down only four rebounds in23 minutes. The 6-foot-2 Boynton
had six.
"There was a lot of hype that
this guy was going to cure all of our
center problems because we were
playing guys at different positions,"
Donovan said. "You could see to-
night, that's not the case."
If Macklin can develop into a
steady rebounder and shot-changer
in the lane, he will do wonders for
this team.
UF doesn't need him to score 15
points per game, especially with
Boynton in the lineup.
The Gators only need Macklin
to be good enough to provide some
tough, defensive-minded minutes at
the center position, along with Mur-
phy and sophomore Kenny Kadji.
Regardless of the perceptions
the four new guys may have cre-
ated in only 40 minutes of play, they
will have plenty of time to change
Gainesville's mind in the coming
weeks.
For better or worse.Wa Iker a dds 16 points, nine assists at PG
HOOPS, from page 13
"It's a whole other level. I was nervous in the
(McDonald's) All-American Game, and I was
still in high school then," Boynton said. "In col-
lege, you want to give the fans a good outing on
your first."
Starting in the backcourt alongside Boynton,
Erving Walker scored 16 points and dished out
nine assists without a turnover in his debut as
UF's starting point guard. Walker helped push
the ball up the court all game, allowing the
Gators to use their athleticism against the out-
matched Lions.
"I don't know if I've had two guys in the
backcourt with (Walker) and Boynton that are
that fast and are that explosive," UF coach Billy
Donovan said. "With those two guys back there,we definitely want to play more up-tempo."
Ray Shipman, primarily used as a defensive
specialist last season, put up 10 points off the
bench. After a summer of playing no one other
than his teammates, Shipman said he was ready
to get back on the floor -
even if the game didn't count
toward the Gators' record.
"We've been playing
Men's each other Summer A, Sum-
Basketball mer B, open gym, practice,
going against each other in
video games," Shipman said.
"Now, we get to play against somebody with a
different name across their chest, and I feel like
we just maximized and let all that anger out on
them.
"I felt bad for them because we wanted to
just destroy them."

Butler keeps team sharp with no set starting lineup
By EUGENIO TORRENS
Alligator Writer
etorrens@alligatororg
Florida coach Amanda Butler knows
cracking the starting lineup may seem like
a big deal to some.
But for her, it's all about the end of the
game rather than the opening introduc-
tions.
With the start of the UF women's bas-
ketball season inching closer, Butler still
isn't sure who will be in her starting five.
And she wouldn't have it any other
way.
"We can change our lineup to try and
exploit the weaknesses of whoever our
next opponent is," Butler said. "We're not
bound to a starting lineup."
While not having a cemented staring
lineup may sacrifice a bit of consistency
once the season starts, Butler believes the
myriad of combinations she can throw out
onto the floor on any given night is well
worth the possible lack of stability.
"There's a lot of versatility in what
we have," center Azania Stewart said
."Whatever looks we want to go: big,
small, fast."
If the lineup is shuffled routinely, it
should help players stay on their toes be-
cause anyone's number could be called on
any given night.
"If I'm not starting, when I get in the
game, my mentality is definitely to do
what I need to do to either get to that start-
ing position or play more minutes," guard
Trumae Lucas said. "It's definitely a com-
petition thing."
Butler also hopes the day-to-day star-
ing lineup will prevent the team from
flatlining in January or February, whenplayers become accustomed to who is in
what role.
She has used different examples to
prove the benefits of competition to her
team. Butler has pointed to Michael
Phelps'record-breaking swims with oppo-
nents nipping at his heels as well as a Bible
verse, Proverbs 27:17 ("So iron sharpens
iron, one man sharpens another").
In Butler's mind, competition breeds
success, and her team is beginning to em-
brace that concept.
Jordan Jones is one of eight guards list-
ed on the team's roster. Each will be com-
peting for playing time, and some may
get time at swingman
or point. Jones started
at South Carolina her
freshman year before
Women's transfering to UF and
Basketball being forced to sit out
the 2008-09 season.
"No matter what
minutes I get, starting, not starting -be-
ing able to play again, it's just a huge gift
in its own," Jones said.
Butler may start the game with more
of a true point guard, like senior Lonnika
Thompson or freshman Tessah Holt. Lu-
cas and Jones are likely to see time at point
guard as well.
Lucas poses more of a threat to drive
to the basket, while Jones is a bonafide
shooter who used last year to improve
other aspects of her game, including ball
handling and driving to the basket.
While point guard may be the best ex-
ample of depth on this year's squad, it's
emblematic of the whole team.
"We can have plan A, B, C and D and
on any given night, any one of those plans
is going to work," Butler said.

UF's Brandon Spikes (51) has been suspended for a half for attempt-
ing to eye-gouge UGA running back Washaun Ealey on Saturday.university suspended Spikes for
the first half of its next game (vs.
Vanderbilt, Nov. 7) for an unsports-
manlike act during the Gators' last
game (vs. Georgia, Oct. 31)."
Spikes led Florida with 10 tack-
les against Georgia. Redshirt se-
nior linebacker Ryan Stamper will
move inside against the Commo-
dores, and senior Dustin Doe will
likely see his second start of the
season. Doe got the nod against
Mississippi State when Spikes did
not play due to a groin injury.
"I accept responsibility for my
actions, and I accept the conse-
quences of my actions," Spikes
said in a statement. "I would like
to apologize to my team and the
coaching staff and Washaun Ea-
ley. Football is a very physical and
emotional game, but there is no ex-
cuse for my actions."
While this incident may not
be the best example, Tebow said
Spikes' passionate personality is
key to his ability as a player and a
leader.
"He's very intense and very
emotional and very passionate,"
Tebow said. "I think that's what
makes him part of the great player
that he is. He brings that fire and
people look at him. The defense
wants to play for him, and the of-
fense -they want to score so it
makes it easier on him. He brings
fire, and he brings juice to every-
body.
"Without that, he would not be
as great of a player as he is, and
he would not be even close to the
leader that he is."
