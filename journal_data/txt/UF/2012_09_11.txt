Cody Thomas’ father thinks his 
son’s life is ruined.
Thomas, a 19-year-old network-
ing services sophomore at Santa 
Fe College, has size 4-gauge, 5.189 
mm, stretched earlobes.
“I can tell, when people are 
looking at me, that they think I may 
not be up to society’s standards,” Thomas said. “They feel that since I have these holes in my ears that there may be something wrong with me.”
According to a recent article in 
Inked Magazine, a tattoo lifestyle magazine, two out of ﬁ  ve students have some sort of body modiﬁ  ca-tion.
Michelle Clarkson, a 19-year-old 
UF journalism sophomore, has two tattoos, one on her wrist and one on her foot. Her wrist tattoo is for her sister, who was diagnosed with 
cancer, and her foot tattoo repre-sents her faith.
She said people have come up 
to her and asked her the meaning 
behind her tattoos, which she ap-preciates. She said she doesn’t be-
lieve she is viewed as a delinquent 
because her tattoos are “delicate looking.”
The professional world differs 
from the way society views a tattoo, especially businesses in the public eye.
Post-graduation job hunting is a 
difﬁ  cult time for students with the 
U.S. economy still on a steady de-
cline, according to a July 23 CNBC article.
Thomas doesn’t believe a body 
modiﬁ  cation would hurt his chance at a job.
“I’ve talked with people in net-
working and they do not care about your physical appearance, they care 
more about your intelligence,” he 
said. “That is what it usually comes down to.”
Clarkson said she decided to be 
safe and got her tattoos on parts of her body she can cover easily.
Individual business policies on 
the body modiﬁ  cation issue differ

UF’s Ofﬁ  ce of Sustainability will 
host an Alternative Transportation 
Fair from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. Wednes-
day on the Reitz Union North Lawn.
Students can learn different modes 
of transportation and the beneﬁ  ts of 
using them.
The fair will feature both student 
organizations and local businesses, including Gators for a Sustainable Campus, Mr. Goodbike and the Re-gional Transit System.
“At the fair, we’ll be doing small 
seminars on basic repairs, things such as chain maintenance and tire re-pairs,” said Student Government Bike 
Repair manager Sergio Gomez, 21.
In addition to cycling, attendees 
can learn about using buses and car-
pooling.Ofﬁ  ce of Sustainability staff mem-
ber Michael Amish said there will also be a limited amount of free T-shirts given to people who pledge to 
not use a single-occupancy vehicle on 
One Less Car Day, Oct. 31.
UF has an overall goal of being 
carbon neutral by 2025, and trans-portation-related carbon emissions account for about 10 percent of UF’s 
carbon footprint, according to a press 
release.
The fair aims to encourage stu-
dents to help the community in cut-ting back.

At about 9 a.m. on Sept. 11, 2001, Lindsey 
Kelly was in her third-grade math class.
When two planes crashed into the World 
Trade Center, her teacher turned on the TV 
in the classroom to watch the news. Eight-year-old Kelly didn’t really understand what was going on.
Now, 11 years later, the 19-year-old 
nursing sophomore feels the impact of the terrorist attack.
“It was a big event that changed every-
thing about the United States,” Kelly said.
The events of 9/11 brought Americans 
together. 
Today at UF, amid controversy and 
mud-slinging as the two major politi-
cal parties campaign for the presidency, 
they’re still together.
The UF College Democrats and UF Col-lege Republicans will collaborate for the ﬁ  rst time to co-sponsor a tribute ceremo-ny at 7:30 p.m. tonight at the Plaza of the Americas. Attendees will light candles, 
observe a moment of silence and join in a 
short prayer.
Representatives from each group will 
speak, said UF College Republicans Chair-
woman Katy Melchiorre.
The 21-year-old political science and 
telecommunication senior said the orga-
nization has held a candlelight vigil every year since she was a freshman.
She said it’s nice to take a break from 
campaigning and work together.
“This means a lot to everybody,” Mel-
chiorre said. “It’s not a partisan issue.”
Billy Farrell, UF College Democrats 
president, agreed.

� UF’S COUNSELING AND WELLNESS 
CENTER HAS TWO THERAPY DOGS. 
DANIELLE BOYD
Alligator Contributing Writer
Sigmund F. Welsch isn’t your typical thera-
pist.
As stressed-out students walk onto the sec-
ond floor of the Counseling and Wellness Cen-
ter, they’re greeted by the 1-year-old Havanese 
with wet kisses.
“He gives kisses to all the students,” said 
Paula Dragutsky, the second-floor secretary.
Psychologists Barbara Welsch and Jennifer 
Stuart have brought in therapy dogs like Sig-
mund for a year to help relieve students’ anxi-ety during counseling sessions.
As new students flock to their first college 
classes, they can get overwhelmed with home-
work or feelings of loneliness, Welsch said.
“Something about petting animals lowers 
blood pressure,” she said.
Sigmund, with his long, wispy hair and 
11-pound frame, prefers to chase his toys — 
when he isn’t jumping in patients’ laps.
When students come in for an appoint-
ment, Sigmund sits with them during the counseling sessions. Welsch said he picks up on patients’ body language and knows when to console them.
With the mounting stress of college classes, she said, some students find him to be a wel-come relief.
“Students become irritable, sad, anxious 
and have increased worries,” Welsch said. “Some may display more physical symptoms like headaches or shoulder and neck pain.”
To work at the counseling center, Sigmund 
had to pass tests, too. Welsch said he and other therapy dogs were tested on their ability to stay happy and cheerful while being subjected to unusual noises, numerous patients, and un-familiar objects like wheelchairs and crutches.
Sigmund and Gabe, a 5-year-old shih tzu, 
are the only therapy dogs at the center, but there’s talk of adding a third dog, Welsch said.
Therapy dogs were added to the counsel-
ing center, in part, because some students see counseling as intimidating. Welsch said a hap-py puppy can help patients relax and open up about what’s bothering them.
“They smile more and interact with each 
other more,” Welsch said.
Sigmund likes to make his presence known 
by prancing around the center, Welsch said. Gabe is quieter but will look at patients with his big eyes and cock his tiny head to the side, 
sometimes on command.
Dragutsky said these hard-working pups 
have made a big impact on many students 
and staff.
“I’ve seen amazing reactions how students 
interact,” she said. “I can see that they can calm them and cheer them up sometimes.”

RemembeRing 9/11
KATHRYN VARN
Alligator Contributing Writer
Eleven years ago today , Lt. Todd 
Kelly was lobster fishing in the 
Keys. He climbed back in the boat to find others gathered around a radio, listening to reports that the twin towers had fallen.
Since that day, security has tight-
ened across the nation, including in Gainesville, said Kelly , spokesman for the Alachua County Sheriff’s Of-fice.
The biggest effects can be seen 
during Gators football games, said University Police Capt. Jeff Hol-comb, who was working at the UPD dispatch center when he watched the first tower go down.
Since the attacks, police presence 
at Gators games has increased, he said. They keep an especially close eye now on any event where thou-sands of people attend.
The Gainesville Fire Rescue has 
increased security at football games as well, said Chief Gene Prince, who spent 9/11 calling to see if the fire department could help and watch-
ing the events on TV .
The department set up detectors 
in the stadium to monitor chemicals 
and environments, Prince said, and there is a decontamination plan in 
case of a chemical emergency.
In fact, a federal mandate was 
instituted after 9/11 that required more training to familiarize officers 
and fire rescuers with the National 
Incident Management System, 
Prince said.
“Those are things we continue to 
work on,” Prince said.
Communication among various 
responding agencies improved as well, Prince said.
There is now a federal radio 
mandate that requires law enforce-ment and fire rescue from neighbor -
ing counties to have a shared radio channel that they can all access in 
the case of a widespread emergen-
cy.
While this change has been na-
tionwide, Prince and Kelly both 
said Alachua County has made a 
tremendous amount of progress 
with communication.
“If we were to have a large-
scale emergency situation, all the 
responding agencies can now com-
municate and ensure that we can 
work together,” Kelly said. “There’s 
kind of a seamless transition in the communication aspect.”
Kelly also said officers are gener -
ally more aware of their surround-ings.
Officers get to know who the 
mailmen and delivery people are at 
early hours of the morning, he said, 
so flags start coming up more often 
if an officer sees anything out of the ordinary.
The attacks shook police and fire 
officials as much as students and 
Gainesville residents, Kelly said. 
Eleven years later, it rallies them to work to make their city safer.
“We have the same range of 
emotions that everyone else did,” 
Kelly said. “It definitely magnified 
our sense of purpose.”Security increases prompted by 9/11 attacks still in place
“If we were to have a 
large-scale emergency 
situation, all the responding 
agencies can now commu-
nicate and ensure that we 
can work together.”

UF students wanting to go green can start 
the old-fashioned way.
Student volunteers replanted two herb gar -
dens outside Gator Corner Dining Center on 
Monday night and will be replanting two oth-ers at Fresh Food Company tonight.
The volunteers are planting mostly basil, 
parsley and cilantro, said Leah Chapman, sus-tainability manager for ARAMARK Higher Education. Other herbs, including chives, rose-mary , oregano and spearmint will be planted, too.
Dining hall chefs will use the herbs, which 
will fully mature in about a month, in their cooking. Chefs in the Reitz Union will use them while preparing food for catering events.
“During peak season, we hope to produce at 
least five pounds of herbs from each bed every week,” Chapman said.
The herbs were planted in boxes instead of 
in-ground beds because raised beds are better for growing small amounts of herbs and veg-etables, she said.
The gardens will be maintained by Gator 
Dining Services, UF’s Office of Sustainability and the Physical Plant Division.
Entomology freshman Andre Szejner, 21, 
said he came to plant the herbs because he likes 
gardening.
Monday, he pulled out old basil and orega-
no plants to make room for new herbs.
“I will definitely be coming back if it’s need-
ed,” he said.4, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 11, 2012

Farrell said in the past, each group held 
its own tribute. 
But with the current political divide due 
to election season, he said the two groups 
decided to join together. 
They had attempted to co-sponsor events 
in the past, but this will be their first.  
Like Kelly and many current college 
students, Farrell and Melchiorre were in elementary school when terrorists hijacked two American Airlines flights and two 
United Airlines flights that crashed into 
the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and a field in Pennsylvania, killing almost 3,000 people.
Farrell was in fourth grade but didn’t 
know anything about it until he came home from school and watched the TV coverage. Melchiorre watched it in her fifth-grade classroom.
Although she had no idea what was hap-
pening at the time, she remembers it viv-idly. 
She said future generations may not be 
able to grasp the significance of 9/11.
“We have to remind them how tragic it 
was,” Melchiorre said.
Contact Samantha Shavell at sshavell@
alligator.org.9/11 , from page 1Students remember little of the daySome employers only ban     
excessive tattoos and piercings
depending on the workplace.
Jonathan Goldberg, a lawyer at 
Goldberg Law Office, 1013 SW Second 
Ave., said his hiring policies are differ -
ent.
“It’s a personal preference,” he said. 
“If the interviewee meets the standards for the job we aren’t going to avoid them because they chose to express themselves.”
Goldberg said the exception is if 
they had enough piercings or tattoos to make a client feel uncomfortable. 
Then, he wouldn’t be able to hire 
him or her.
Whether a tattoo or a stretched ear -lobe, there’s no consensus about how employers feel about body modifica-tions. Thomas had a solution to the worrying.
“Be who you want to be and don’t 
worry about what other people think 
about you,” he said. “Once you do that,

Would you purchase a huge 
alligator standing in the Heis-
man trophy pose?
A 63-year-old Tim Tebow fan 
is selling the 13-foot-4-inch alli-
gator on eBay . And for $15,000, 
it can be yours.
The gator is wearing a Tim 
Tebow jersey and holding a foot-ball signed by all three UF Heis-man quarterbacks.
“Anybody with any Gator 
blood at all should be real excit-ed about this,” said Don Perkins, 
the owner of the alligator.
He thinks Tebow, or “TimBo” 
as he calls him, might want it and 
said he has been trying to get in contact with him. Perkins plans to distribute fliers to Gainesville sports bars and businesses.
He thinks the gator would look great on the football field and said he would bring it to a game, so it could be put next to the cheerleaders or paraded on the field at halftime.
His cousin, 
Dennis Per -
kins, caught the close-to-
re c o rd - s i z e gator in the F i s h e a t i n g Creek Wild-life Manage-ment Area in 
November.
Dennis was called by law 
enforcement game wardens, Perkins said, to remove the 700-pound nuisance gator from the Palmdale area, because it was halting construction of a bridge over the creek.

Sunday to raise money for the St. Francis House Pet Care Clinic.
About 20 pet owners gath-
ered at the pet store for profes-sional photos by Glamour Pets, a photography group based out 
of Cape Canaveral. The event 
raised about $200 by donating part of the photography fee to the clinic.

to Earth Pets wearing a Karma Paws Couture doggy outfit, ready for her close-up.
Machen, first lady of UF and 
a co-founder of the St. Fran-cis House Pet Care Clinic, said she and Earth Pets owner Joy Drawdy started talking when 
the clinic opened five years ago 
and have been in close contact since.
“Our clinic, as far as we know, 
is the only one of its kind,” Ma-
chen said.The clinic offers free care to 
animals owned by homeless, un-
employed and low-income resi-dents of Alachua County.
“Not only are we taking 
care of the animals of these re-ally wonderful people — who are some of the best pet owners 
we’ve ever met,” she said, “but 
we also want to build a relation-ship with the person.”
The clinic was based out of the 
St. Francis House for four years, 
then it temporarily moved to 
the Civic Media Center for four months. It has been at their cur -
rent location on 501 SE Second 
St. for about six months.
Machen, who owns a Jack 
Russell terrier and a Labrador 
retriever, said she appreciates the community coming together 
to help pets.
“There’s a lot of crazy cat

Rob Roche is on the search to 
make the perfect poutine.
Roche, owner of Relish Big Tasty 
Burgers in downtown Gainesville, 
plans to bring the Canadian special-
ity snack to the city . Relish expects 
to be the first to bring the dish to Gainesville, but shipping issues have kept Relish from serving it.
Poutine, a dish of fries drenched 
in cheese curds and thick beef stock gravy, is common in Canada and in the American North, but it’s a rarity in Florida.
Aubrey Helm, a 23-year-old 
server at the downtown Relish, said customers have been eager to try their poutine.
“I’ve had a couple people come 
back and ask, ‘Do you have it yet? Do you have it?’” she said.
Ryan Edgar, 29-year-old man-
ager of Relish downtown, said he’s 
never seen the snack served in a res-
taurant in the state.
“The only time I’ve ever had it 
was when my buddy made it for Canada Day,” he said.
Roche, who plans to charge $4 
per plate of poutine, has the right fries for the dish and is on the search for the perfect curds. He said he flew 
to Canada to find the right ones.Roche knows what it looks like, 
tastes like and even what it sounds 
like when his teeth squeak against it. The wrong curds will ruin a dish.
“Rob and Edgar are severely Ca-
nadian, so they’re on the search for the perfect cheese,” Helm said. ‘They don’t want to expose Gainesville to an imperfect poutine.”Roche hasn’t been able to find a 
cost-effective company that can ship the curds in time to maintain the freshness necessary to make the per -
fect poutine.
Curd samples will be shipped to 
the store Thursday from the Roth 
Käse plant in southern Wisconsin, 
Rob’s third attempt at finding the right curds.
Kraig Depue, Roche’s food sup-
plier and a marketing associate for Sysco Foods, said cheese curds are a difficult item to get to Florida.
“We’re trying to get him the right 
formula, but it’s a very perishable 
product,” he said. “Nobody makes 
it down here. It’s just not a Southern thing.”
Lauren Litchet, an 18-year-old 
physiology and kinesiology fresh-man, said she had never heard of poutine until she visited Canada.
“It was all over the place,” she 
said. “It was advertised on every 
menu. It was at vendors on the street 
corners, fast food places and in little diners, especially burger-esque plac-es and bars.”
Edgar said the perfect poutine 
will be worth the wait.
“Eventually , we’re going to have 
it, and it’s going to be delicious,” he said. “You just have to try it.”

� THE PROMOTION WASN’T MEANT 
TO OFFEND, MANAGER SAID.

Saereedun wanted to strap on some goofy 
shoes and have a fun date night at Splitz bowl-
ing alley.
It was Ladies Night, so Saereedun brought 
her girlfriend hoping one of them could bowl 
for free. But they left before they even saw the 
lanes.
“They asked if we had two men coming 
with us,” Saereedun said.
The couple wasn’t able to redeem a ladies’ night discount Aug. 23 after managers at Splitz told the two they needed a man with them.
The Ladies Night deal, according to the 
website, gives a woman a night of free bowl-ing, but only if a man buys an all-you-can-bowl pass.
Will Lariscey , a manager at Splitz, said 
the bowling alley had the promotion to bring more men into the amusement center, some-thing the alley has struggled with.
“We’re not biased or against gay rights or 
anything like that,” Lariscey said. “That’s just 
how our promotion is set up. You can bring 
your nephew or your dad. As long as a guy buys it, you get yours free.”
Saereedun’s situation was complicated — 
she was born a man.Saereedun prefers to be described as QT*, 
where the Q stands for queer and the T* stands for transgendered or bi-gendered. Saereedun 
is her drag performance name.
While Saereedun switches appearances 
regularly and describes her gender as “fluid,” 
she was presenting herself as a female when she and her partner went to Splitz.
The dispute began when Saereedun ap-
proached the cashier, who told the couple they had to have a man with them to get a deal. The cashier called management, who told Saeree-dun the same thing.
“Personally , I felt incredibly invisible,” she 
said. “My partner was crying. She was very upset. She’s not very comfortable being out in public, so to have this happen during one of our first times out together was horrible.”
Katie Connolly , Splitz spokeswoman, said 
no one meant to make the couple upset.
She said Splitz values their LGBT custom-
ers and hosts the Rainbow League, a local gay bowling league, each week.
“We have 21-and-up nights, and 20-year-
olds get mad,” she said. “It doesn’t matter what we do. We’re always going to offend someone.”

Romney’s plane,     
message don’t take off
From the Democratic National Convention, President 
Obama headed to Florida to take on this notorious swing 
state of ours.
The election might come down to us, folks.
Florida and Ohio have been key states in recent elections; 
no Republican has ever won office without winning Ohio, and Florida has the most electoral college votes of the two with 29.
Should we feel special that Obama has spent the past few 
days touring our state? Or should we feel spoiled because we’re most likely only getting this focused attention because of the na-ture of our election system?
While here, Obama visited a pizza shop where the owner, 
Scott Van Duzer, lifted the president off the ground.
Don’t worry , he asked for permission first, according to the 
Tampa Bay Times.
A Secret Service agent assured that “I was all right as long as 
I didn’t take him away,” Van Duzer said.
Van Duzer’s shop was chosen because of his work in the 
community.
“One of the reasons that we wanted to stop by is that Scott 
has been doing unbelievable work out of this pizza shop in pro-
moting the importance of donating blood,” Obama said. “And 
so, he has set some records here in Florida. He has received com-mendations from the White House, the surgeon general, he has galvanized and mobilized the local community and he’s educat-ing kids and folks all across the country on this issue.”
The president even got a little sassy during his campaign’s 
stop in Kissimmee.
According to the Orlando Sentinel, he started to poke fun at 
Mitt Romney , and other Republicans, for offering the same tax 
plan as they have for years: tax cuts for the wealthy.
“Tax cuts when times are good. Tax cuts when times are bad. 
Tax cuts to lose a few pounds. Tax cuts to improve your love 
life,” Obama said. “I’ve cut taxes for folks who need it.”
It seems as if Obama is connecting, or at least trying to con-
nect, with the middle-class families and the minority vote in Florida; he even connected with Gainesville and football fans by doing a couple of “Gator chomps.”
But while Obama’s tour of Florida seems to help him get his 
point across, Romney’s message is stalled on the tarmac.
We love when reality creates metaphors for us.On Saturday night, the plane that carries Romney , his staff 
and the loyal-yet-exhausted press corps to and fro broke down.
To pass the time, reporters took to Twitter to complain hilari-
ously with tweets like these posts from Bonney Kapp, a reporter with CBS News: “Romney charter turned power off+on twice now. reax in press section: that’s what I do with my computer when it isn’t working” and “Romney charter shuts down power 
for 3rd time bf takeoff. ‘Control Alt Delete,’ someone in press 
cabin says. #stillinRichmond.”
The plane eventually reached Massachusetts safely.Guess the robot apple doesn’t fall far from the metaphor tree. 
Not even Romney’s “Believe In America” plane did well this weekend.There are many general truths about UF that stu-
dents should know.
The most important: The higher the floor, the 
cleaner the bathroom.
The next most important: You ever notice how books 
in required classes — either general education or criti-cal tracking, but more often the former — are plentiful, 
expensive and (more often than not) written, compiled or edited by your professor? In those classes, a signifi-
cant portion of your grade comes from some assessment 
or other to make sure you “read” — purchased — the 
book and went to class. And these assessments are usu-
ally with some sort of online companion that comes along with the book that you have to pay for?
That’s pretty standard.The worst offender at UF is the Age of Dinosaurs class, 
taught halfheartedly by some aloof archaeologist who au-thored an overly expensive book and companion CD.
The class is of such obviously little academic merit it’s 
hard to imagine why it’s a staple of the course offerings. 
But imagine the reason I did:
Textbook companies are always in a tizzy to make 
money because they’re selling a product people usually buy begrudgingly. Once books are reprinted, students 
resell them to each other, and the company sees none of 
that money. Worse yet, students don’t want to read the 
books at all. But then computers came along and allowed 
the textbook companies to sell licenses to online compan-
ions, which the professors always seem to use.
Well, the Age of Dinosaurs professor realized if he 
wrote up a textbook and put all the tests on a CD that 
comes with the book, students would assemble a test bank 
of all the questions and distribute it, making the class an easy A for anyone willing to pay the toll. The students 
need a science credit, and Hera forbid they take a class 
where the professor requires thinking (or even reading) 
and gives you a C if you don’t.
There’s no way the professor is oblivious to this.
Textbook companies take great pains to ensure kids in premed classes can’t cheat the 
system like those in Age of Di-
nosaurs can. 
Hell, the chemistry depart-
ment even scans all the lab re-ports in CHM2045L into a data-
base and cross-references them 
to find any cheaters.
(I know this because I includ-
ed the word “skanky” in one of 
my lab reports and the scanner has an obscenity filter. 
Horvath was not pleased.)
The textbook company doesn’t care if you read the 
book; they only care that you buy it — and so does the professor, so he can get his royalties.
So they’ve offered a way for students to satisfy their 
general education requirement and boost their GPA with-
out ever opening a book. That’s an offer a student would 
be hard-pressed to refuse.
Both the students and the professor know they’re do-
ing something unethical that benefits the both of them, so 
no one says anything about it.
This is why the standard talk most professors give 
about plagiarism and cheating drives me nuts.
They act as if it’s because the members of my genera-
tion innately have worse ethics than those prior — and therefore we need to receive thorough lectures on copy-
right law and “academic integrity.” But I think students 
are receiving mixed messages from professors about the subject.
That’s why that unfortunate student who got caught 
cheating in a computer science class last Spring for hav-ing old test data had the gall to say, “I’m really angry at the fact that students got away with this in earlier semes-
ters. We are taking the hit, and I believe that is unfair.”
Students know this behavior isn’t right, but some pro-
fessors make it more OK than others.

opinions@alligator.org TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 11, 2012 § ALLIGATOR, 7
I was raised by a gay, single father. A recent study by Uni-
versity of Texas at Austin sociology professor Mark Reg-
nerus found that children raised by gay parents are at a 
disadvantage. One of the many responses to the study was the assertion by a conservative Christian group on campus 
that scientific studies are less important than “the moral ques-
tion of homosexuality” when considering same-sex parenting. While I think the group’s claim is disingenuous, taken at face value, the assertion is useful.
I find the assertion disingenuous because it tries to dismiss 
the scientific consensus of the last decade by shifting the de-bate from a scientific paradigm to a religious one seemingly more favorable for conservative Christians. The assertion, however, deserves attention because we can reflect on the fact 
that, as conservatives point out, many times studies have been 
used to shut out moral questions, close debates and diminish personal experience with the old adage, “The numbers don’t lie.” The problem for conservative Christians who make this argument is that proponents of gay rights are not the ones who have pushed dated sociological concepts regarding the child’s best interest for years. The other side has, through its claim of gay parenting’s detriment to the child. My experience causes me to agree that studies are not the final say but has 
also caused me to ask a different moral question: What value 
does individual sacrifice have in this debate?
I grew up in a small, upper-middle-class neighborhood in 
Dallas and attended the Ridgewood Park United Methodist Church there. At church, close friends would all gush with praise about the dedication of my single father, his forbear -
ance of my impulsiveness (ADHD), his generosity, his teach-ing me to be available to those at the church who needed help cooking luncheons or cleaning up afterward and his insistence 
that we give our share of prayers, presence and service to the 
youth group.
The praise would turn less re-
sounding after our friends in the 
congregation learned that my fa-ther was gay.
Notwithstanding all of his generosity and their previous 
praise of his parenting skills, my father could never again meet their parenting standards. The sometimes explicit, but mostly 
unstated, question — “He’s amazing, but what would Travis 
be if he had been raised in a normal family?” —    qualified my 
father’s long list of parental accomplishments, which include 
raising me in every stage of my educational development, from special education in elementary school to the University of Texas, where I am a two-time UT Presidential Scholar.
My father searched out and found trusted childcare for the 
times he taught night classes. My father paid for the piano les-sons that led me to attend Booker T. Washington High School 
for the Performing and Visual Arts, a fine arts magnet in Dal-
las. My father went to the aforementioned Methodist church because of its strong community and youth group when he could have been more at peace at the Cathedral of Hope or the United Church of Christ, both either gay or gay-affirm-ing churches. My father was there to teach me ethics, critical thinking and, yes, religious principles.
As for the concept of “normal families,” the man who is the 
very inspiration for those Christians who condemn “alterna-
tive family forms,” was technically conceived out of wedlock, 
raising suspicion in his community (Mark 6:3), and, accord-ing to Matthew, had a genealogy full of heroic “disreputable” women who sacrificed for their families (Tamar, Rahab, Bath-sheba and Ruth, the foreigner of the group).
It is not necessary to debate my father’s homosexuality 
and its moral status in the Christian tradition any more than divorce or sex outside of wedlock. I am not asking Christian institutions to support same-sex marriages or to host religious 
same-sex weddings. However, in a liberal republic, the moral 
question is not about stereotypes of same-sex lifestyles any more than it is about Vegas marriages and general promiscu-ity. The “moral question” is, did my father, who was willing to make extraordinary sacrifices, have the right to raise me? Yes. Does he deserve due credit and praise for the job he did? Absolutely. My father’s due is more consideration than to be judged on a “normal” distribution curve.

Speaking OutAnother year, another election, another campaign 
urging us to “rock the vote.”
Sigh.
Politics has always fascinated me, but it’s hard to get 
interested in the presidential election. I know my vote doesn’t matter. A vote for incumbent President Barack Obama, a vote for Republican contender Mitt Romney — neither one matters.
No, not because I am just one lonely man with a sin-
gle vote, but because of where I live.
As an occasionally left-leaning citizen, I know that in 
Oklahoma, it doesn’t matter who I vote for.
If I vote for Romney, I’ll just go along with what the 
rest of conservative Oklahoma will choose. In the 2008 election, we were the only state that voted in favor of Republican candidate John McCain in every single county.
We’re so conservative, we voted Rick Santorum to be 
the Republican nominee.
Oklahomans may be upset Santorum didn’t ulti-
mately triumph, but I don’t think they will protest by voting for Obama. Oklahomans will gladly let him keep the change.
A vote for Obama in Oklahoma is a complete waste. 
I am currently undecided, but I know if I vote for him, my vote will simply disappear because the majority in Oklahoma decides where all of our electoral votes go.
This is all thanks to the bizarre and uniquely Ameri-
can system we call the Electoral College. If we elected the president by popular vote, my decision would make a difference. The tally would be slightly larger for one candidate because of my individual vote. What a satis-faction that would be.
The strongest argument against the Electoral College 
in recent memory is the debacle from 2000 that culmi-nated in the controversial Supreme Court case, Bush v. Gore. The national popular vote had already been de-cided and Gore won, but because of our voting system, we were forced to recount the votes in one state. Even-tually, the Supreme Court intervened to rule whether Bush’s previously announced victory in Florida would stand. Five conservatives outvoted four liberals in favor of Bush.
In the end, nine people previously appointed by vari-
ous presidents decided the next leader of the free world. The only popular vote that mattered was that of nine jus-tices. For Bush’s detractors, this one incident is enough to prove the foolishness of the Electoral College.
In fact, 75 percent of Democrats polled days after the judgment said they were for the abolition of the system.
Proponents of the Electoral 
College argue that the system gives states more power. This 
isn’t necessary. It makes more sense to count each vote individually rather than lump us arbitrarily by states. There is no reason to pit the states against each other when voting for president, and there is no reason to be-lieve that all Oklahomans, for example, desire the same thing simply because they are Oklahomans.
Yes, we are a conservative state, but obviously not 
every Oklahoman has the same political viewpoint.
Others argue that small states need protection; the 
type only the electoral college can give them. This idea is outdated.
Back in the time of the Founding Fathers, states were 
fiercely independent and competitive. For this reason, the Great Compromise of 1787 created a House based on state population and a Senate based on equal repre-sentation from every state. We don’t experience these same conflicts anymore.
Big states like Texas and California don’t “gang up” 
on the Rhode Islands and Wyomings of America. If any-thing, the little states gang up on the big ones.
In 2000, for example, California received one electoral 
vote for every 615,848 people while Wyoming received one electoral vote for every 164,594 people.
That means every Wyomingite’s vote was worth 
more than three times as much as a Californian’s. That simply isn’t a fair democracy.
Furthermore, the votes in swing states count for more 
than they do in a tried-and-true red or blue state’s. Ohio and Pennsylvania receive extra attention due to their tendency to go either red or blue depending on the year and the candidates.
Oklahoma receives nothing in the way of political 
campaigning; everyone already knows where our votes will go.
Yes, the Founding Fathers were brilliant, but they 
didn’t foresee a country of 50 states and a population of 300 million in the future. It’s time for the popular vote to reign. After all, 62 percent of Americans are for it, though that statistic may be irrelevant to one who views the popular vote with disdain.
Following the popular vote is a clear and fair way to 
elect the president.

Walter Liddell tried to get some 
sleep in his camper on Saturday af-
ternoon. Instead, he got a face full of dirty underwear.
The Alachua County Sheriff’s Of-
fice arrested Johnny Wade Broestler, 46, of 9428 N. County Road 226, and 
charged him with battery for alleg-
edly attacking Liddell, 60, with a pair of soiled underwear, according to an ASO arrest report.
At about 4 p.m. Saturday, Broestler 
walked into the camper while Liddell slept and started demanding money for the landlord.
Liddell woke up, and the men 
started arguing.
The dispute turned physical when 
Broestler grabbed the dirty under -
wear and smeared it on Liddell’s face, according to the report.“The underwear was full of poop, 
and he was trying to wipe it all over me,” Liddell said Monday.
Liddell then pushed Broestler 
away and shoved the underwear back 
in Broestler’s face.
The fight spilled 
out onto Liddell’s driveway , where a neighbor broke up the dispute, and Liddell called po-lice. 
“When the cops 
came by , he was 
still covered with the poop,” Liddell said. “He never tried to wash himself to get it off.”
Police booked Broestler into Alach-
ua County Jail at 5:51 p.m. Saturday, where he remained Monday night with a bond set at $5,000.

When Stephen Ruffin first sat down to 
memorize William Shakespeare’s “Mea-
sure for Measure” script, he was lost.
In order to interpret his role as Clau-
dio in the UF School of Theatre + Dance’s upcoming reinterpretation of the 17th-century work, he translated the dialogue into modern English.
“I need to know what the word means 
because I obviously want to be able to portray it in a way the audience can un-derstand,” the 20-year-old acting junior said. “I got to look at a script like I’ve nev-er looked at it before.”
In a move meant to attract more view-
ers, director and theatre professor Ralf Remshardt decided in April to drop the 1603 play into the 1960s — with a “Mad Men” twist. Actors in the play, which will run from Friday to Sept. 23 at the Nadine McGuire Black Box Theatre, will perform Shakespeare’s original script. Tickets are $13 for students and $17 for the general public.
Remshardt said he wanted the audi-
ence to be able to relate easily.
“There is no traditional Shakespearean 
way; if it were, we would all be men acting outside in the middle of the afternoon,” 
he said. “I want students not only to come 
willingly but to realize why Shakespeare 
is the most famous playwright.”
The set design was inspired by 1960s 
advertisements and features era-inspired 
props like billboards. The reinvented play 
features characters in the corporate world 
in a big city similar to New York, Rem-shardt said.
In the original play, a man’s girlfriend 
gets pregnant, which at the time was an 
offense punishable by death. In an ironic 
twist, the deputy who sentenced the man tries to seduce the girlfriend.
Ruffin, who plays Claudio, said the 
1960s theme helped much of the cast 
adapt to the play’s challenging language 
and style.
“Adapting the time period a little closer 
to now acted as a bridge for me,” he said.
Remshardt said the original play fits 
well into a “transitional phase” like the 1960s.
Remshardt said the cast will be per -
forming the original script but with a 
comical tinge.
“It’s often not played comically, so 
I think the audience will enjoy that,” he 
said. “But the audience always has to play the game to have fun.”UF actors put a modern twist on a Shakespeare classicCOLLEEN WRIGHT

Indie pop band Passion 
Pit will stop by UF on its 
world tour.
Passion Pit will perform at 
7 p.m. Oct. 24 at the Stephen C. O’Connell Center, accord-
ing to Student Government Productions Vice Chair of 
Public Relations Evan Galin. The performance will be co-sponsored by Reitz Union Board Entertainment.
Galin would not disclose 
how much the band will be paid for the performance. 
“Passion Pit is a band 
that can relate to a lot of stu-dents,” Galin said, referenc-ing that the group doesn’t stick to a certain genre.
Capacity for the concert 
is capped at 5,000 tickets. Galin said the organization worked to make tickets af-fordable and is conﬁ  dent 
the performance will have a 
good turnout.
Tickets are assigned seat-
ing and will go on sale to UF students at noon Monday at 
the Reitz Union Box Ofﬁ  ce. 
Students can line up for tick-ets starting at 7 a.m. Tickets will be sold on a best avail-able, ﬁ  rst-come, ﬁ  rst-served basis.
Seats in the bleachers in levels one through three are $15, and ﬂ  oor seats are $28 for UF students.
Tickets are $25 for bleach-
er seats and $38 for ﬂ  oor seats for non-students.
Galin estimated that there 
will be 500 ﬂ  oor seats. Tick-ets will open up to the public Sept. 19. When the news broke 
Monday, many students re-acted positively and immedi-
ately RSVP’d to the Facebook 
event.
Exploratory freshman 
Lauren Cox, 18, saw the 
band in Orlando in 2010 and 
is looking forward to seeing them again. She’s expecting Passion Pit’s UF show to be better than her ﬁ  rst experi-ence.
“I really liked the en-
ergy the band brought to the stage,” Cox said. “They seemed really into their mu-
sic.”

Alligator Contributing Writer
UF’s Student Alumni Association has 
merged with its parent organization.
The University of Florida Alumni Asso-
ciation has nearly 350,000 members total, ac-
cording to its website. “The integration came 
as part of an ongoing effort to further involve 
current students despite budget cuts,” said as-sociate executive director Katie Marquis.
“We found many students didn’t realize 
that they had to register with the Alumni As-sociation after they graduated,” Marquis said. “Now we have the student membership op-tion as well as a reduced rate for recent gradu-ates.”
The association has also launched a re-
branding process which includes a new logo.
“It’s unusual to go through so many logos 
so quickly, but after a special 2006 UF centen-nial logo, we have been working on a more 
progressive, powerful and permanent logo,” 
Marquis said. “We expect this one to stay with us.”
She said the cost of the changes is relative-
ly low because most materials with the logo on them are ordered annually. These include nametags, Cicerone shirts and stationery.
“I think the logo is nice, but not very 
modern,” said 19-year-old computer science 
sophomore Anthony Timoti. “But it’s a good 
improvement over the former logo.”UF combines

Injured junior Ronald Powell chats on the sideline during Florida’s 27-14 win against Bowling Green on Sept. 1 at Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium.
  GREG LUCA
 Alligator Staff Writer
   
 For all of Ronald Powell’s 
hard work in the rehab process 
following offseason surgery to repair a torn ACL, his return to the ﬁ  eld will likely have to 
wait until 2013. 
  Coaches originally project-
ed that Powell could be back 
on the ﬁ  eld as early as Oct. 1, 
but the junior will likely re-ceive a medical redshirt fol-lowing a setback. 
  Will Muschamp said the 
Gators are unsure about the extent of Powell’s injury be-cause there is too much swell-ing to get an accurate reading off of his MRI. 
Powell will be reassessed 
next week, but the outlook is 
far from promising. 
  “It’s just disappointing for 
him, a guy that, mentally, has 
been a rock,” Muschamp said.
“It’s been amazing how he’s 
handled the process, and he’s handling it again very well.”
  At Florida’s media day on 
Aug. 2, Powell talked about how the injury helped him mature and gave him a new outlook on  handling adversity and overcoming obstacles. 
  Every report on Powell’s 
response to rehab had been positive. 
In addition to his normal 
work with team trainers, Pow-
ell spent time with defensive 
coordinator Dan Quinn after practice to work on his pass-rushing technique. 
  “He worked extremely 
hard, as hard as our medical staff has seen anybody dedi-cate themselves to rehabbing 
an injury here at the Univer-
sity of Florida,” Muschamp 
said. “We’ve got some folks 
who have been here for a long, 
long time.”
  The Gators have turned to 
Lerentee McCray and Dante 
Fowler Jr. at the Buck lineback-er position to try to replace the former No. 1 overall recruiting 
prospect and his team-leading 
six sacks from 2011. 
At the Buck position this 
season, McCray has totaled 
seven tackles, including a sack against Texas A&M. He also forced a fumble against the Aggies.
Splitting time between Buck and defensive end, Fowler has recorded ﬁ  ve tackles during the ﬁ  rst two games of his UF career.
  Florida will also be looking 
for replacements for Jelani Jen-kins and Cody Riggs. Jenkins is expected to miss four weeks 
after undergoing surgery to 
repair a fractured thumb, 
while Riggs will miss four to 
six weeks because of a small 
fracture in his foot. 
  Antonio Morrison, Mike 
Taylor and Darrin Kitchens 
are all options to replace Jen-kins at weakside linebacker, 
with Muschamp saying the 
team will likely use a rotation going forward. 
  Taylor is ﬁ  fth on the team 
with eight tackles, while Mor-rison, a freshman, ranks third with nine. 
  “Mike and Antonio and Powell likely sidelined for season

 It took three weeks, but for the ﬁ  rst 
time this season the No. 15 Gators (6-2) 
are in control of both sides of the net.
  During the ﬁ  rst weekend of the 2012 
season, coach Mary Wise scrambled to 
put together a new lineup when out-
side hitter Noami Santos-Lamb suffered an ACL teal during the Orange & Blue Scrimmage on Aug. 18. This redirected the team’s focus to its offense.
  “We had to spend so much of our 
time on the offensive side: Who’s going to generate points off of services in tran-sition,” Wise said. “The defense was not 
able to get as much attention.”
  Unfortunately for Florida, No. 4 Tex-
as and No. 8 Stanford took advantage of 
UF’s neglected back row during the Nike Big Four Classic in University Park, Pa. 
  However, in the last weekend be-
fore Southeastern Conference play , the Gators showed that they have a handle 
on both their hitting and defense as they 
grabbed three wins in the Active Ankle Challenge.
  Florida opened up the weekend on 
Friday night with a hitting showcase in a 3-0 (25-18, 25-11, 25-11) win against Jack-
sonville.
  With the 
help of Tanger-
ine Wiggs, Ziva 
Recek, Betsy Smith, Gabby Mallette and 
Dana Backlund, the Gators hit .468, their highest hitting percentage since Oct. 2, 2011, when they hit .469 at Georgia. The ﬁ  ve combined for 38 kills, accounted for 81 percent of the Gators points and hit .540.
  “As hitters, our job is to just ﬁ  nish it 
off, and I think a lot of the praise needs to go to the passer and the setters,” Wiggs said. “For our passers, it’s really a reﬂ  ec-tion of how hard they work and how Gators meld hitting, defense 
UF VolleyballJURNY DUTY
  Will Muschamp doesn’t mind “win-
ning ugly,” but it will only get the 
Gators so far.
  After Florida’s 20-17 win at Texas A&M 
on Saturday, Muschamp said he felt the 
narrow victory justiﬁ  ed the team’s strug-
gles against Bowling Green in the season 
opener.
  “I know I got killed for last week, but 
there’s a reason why we did it,” Muschamp said of playing a grind-it-out style against 
the Falcons. 
“We had a superior football team than 
Bowling Green. Nothing against those 
guys, but we needed to play that way in or-
der to play that way this week in this ball 
game.”
  No team should aim for a performance 
in which it only plays well for one of the game’s two halves.
  Florida gained just 101 yards while al-
lowing 269 in the ﬁ  rst half against Texas 
A&M. 
But, when asked if he was concerned with Saturday’s 
slow start, Mus-
champ disagreed 
with the assertion 
that the start was 
poor.
  “We played 
well on offense; we 
scored the ﬁ  rst pos-
session,” he said.
  One good drive does not constitute a 
good start, especially considering Florida 
mustered just 43 yards of offense on the 
following two drives and the defense was 
gashed throughout the ﬁ  rst two quarters.
  “Not really,” linebacker Jon Bostic said 
when asked if he minds wins that aren’t 
pretty. 
“A win is a win. Regardless of how you 
get it, a win is a win. By 40 points, a point, a half a point, a win is a win.”
  Yes, the ultimate goal is to win every 
game. UF needs two good halves to win “It’s just disappointing 
for him, a guy that men-
tally has been a rock. It’s 
been amazing how he’s 
handled the process, and 
he’s handling it again 
very well.”

Josh Jurnovoy
twitter: @joshjurnovoyBut a ‘W’ in the win col-
umn doesn’t mean the mar -
gin of victory is irrelevant, 
or that struggles should be 
downplayed. 
Because what Florida did 
in the first half on Satur -day will not cut it this week against Tennessee, a team 
that was 27th in the coun-try in total defense in 2011 
and has opened 2012 with 
two wins by a combined 52 
points. 
The Volunteers will be 
better prepared to handle the 
Gators than the Aggies and Falcons were. 
Much was made about 
what, if any, disadvantage Florida would be at because 
it did not have film of Tex-
as A&M, while the Aggies 
could study the Gators’ game 
against the Falcons. 
That difference in prepa-
ration certainly looked like it had an impact, as Florida ap-
peared to be a different team 
in the second half on Satur -
day after getting a look at 
Texas A&M’s new offensive 
and defensive schemes.
The only film of Florida 
going into Saturday was 
from the Bowling Green 
game, in which the staff ad-
mittedly did not open up the 
playbook. 
Unlike the Aggies, the 
Volunteers will be able to see what the Gators did against 
a Southeastern Conference 
team. 
Florida will have film 
of Tennessee playing only 
Georgia State and North Car -
olina State, who barely beat 
UConn.
While Florida will have 
more film to prepare with 
than it did last week, the 
Volunteers will have a better 
idea of how the Gators like to 
start games. 
Given Texas A&M’s early 
success even without that knowledge, the added study 
material could prove key for 
Tennessee.  
Muschamp declined to 
say whether the Gators could win in Knoxville with the 
same first-half performance 
they put on in College Sta-
tion.
“I just want to win,” Mus-
champ said. “Winning is well 
enough.”
That should be the goal, 
but Florida needs to play a 
complete game if it wants 
to achieve that goal on Sat-
urday against the boys from 
Rocky Top.
Contact Josh Jurnovoy at 
jjurnovoy@alligator.org.hard our setters work to get us good, hittable 
balls.”
The momentum of UF’s attack continued 
as it faced Louisiana-Lafayette on Saturday.
Despite dropping a set, the Gators still 
came away with a 3-1 (25-15, 25-14, 23-25, 25-12) win, while tallying 55 kills and 7 aces.
However, it wasn’t until the weekend’s fi-
nal match that Florida’s defense came alive.
Florida relied on blocking and back row 
defense in a 3-1 (22-25, 25-15, 25-21, 25-22) win over Georgia Tech, UF’s toughest 
competition so far in the O’Connell Center.
Smith, Wiggs and 
Chloe Mann led the team to a season-high 11 blocks, while libero Taylor Unroe racked up 17 digs. 
“All the teams compet-
ed with us, but Georgia Tech really gave us a run 
for our money,” Unroe said. “That first set we 
came out asleep, and they made us pay for it. 
We did a good job of recovering and playing hard, and that’s how we won the game.” 
With both its offense and defense at the 
top of its game simultaneously, Florida feels ready to take on its first SEC opponent.
“We’ve talked about it all preseason that 
the season really starts Sept. 14 at Arkansas,” Smith said. “We’re really excited to take this 
show on the road and show the SEC what 
we’re made of.”

org.Kitchens, those guys can play,” senior 
linebacker Jon Bostic said. 
“As soon as they get in, they get the 
play and they’re making checks, just like 
I am.”
Morrison in particular has impressed 
Muschamp with his physical play since 
entering during spring camp as a four-star recruit out of Bolingbrook, Ill.
“He’s a physical linebacker,” Bostic 
said. “He doesn’t play like a freshman. He’s smart. He learns from our mistakes. 
That’s one thing, you see him after every 
practice, he’s beating me into the film 
room.”
To compensate for the loss of Riggs, 
Muschamp said Matt Elam will see more 
time at safety and Jaylen Watkins will play more snaps as the team’s nickel cor -
ner. Riggs was the team’s second-leading tackler among defensive backs with seven stops. 
Riggs has also recorded a pass breakup, 
playing significant time as part of a four-
man rotation at cornerback that includes 
Watkins, Marcus Roberson and Loucheiz Purifoy. 
Luckily for the Gators, Josh Evans is ex-
pected to be fine after suffering a shoulder 
injury on Saturday. 
De’Ante Saunders will likely return 
and see time at safety, nickel and dime 
after missing the season’s first two games 
with what Muschamp called a hamstring 
injury. 
Evans leads Florida with 14 tackles 
despite missing a large portion of Satur -
day’s game, while Saunders tied Elam for the team lead with two interceptions last 
season. 
With a three-man rotation at weakside 
linebacker and added pieces in the second-
ary, Muschamp is confident in Florida’s 
ability to handle the rash of injuries. Last 
season, the Gators had to cross-train play-
ers to fill needs on both sides of the ball.
“We’ll be fine,” Muschamp said. “Our 
depth is still not where it needs to be but 
certainly much better than it was a year ago. 
“We’re not having to switch guys from 
position to position in order to finish a game or prepare guys for a game. It cer -
tainly gives them a comfort level.”

With their top defender out 
indefinitely, the Gators have big 
shoes to fill.  
Redshirt senior Kat Williamson 
suffered a meniscus tear in her right knee during Florida’s match against Florida International on 
Sept. 2. She had her knee surgi-
cally repaired on Wednesday.
“They can’t give me a for-sure 
answer,” Williamson said. “It de-pends on how my body heals. 
Obviously, I would love to come 
back as soon as possible. I’m go-ing to work towards that.”
Last season, the All-American 
center back started every match and logged a team-high 2,176 minutes for the Gators. Prior to UF’s match against FIU, she did not sit out a single minute in 
2012.  
Williamson roamed the side-
lines on crutches and with a brace 
on her right leg as Florida (3-2-1) 
battled to a 3-2 victory against 
New Mexico on Sunday. 
“It’s a huge loss,” senior Holly 
King said. “We’re trying every-thing we can to fill in the hole.”
“We don’t expect one player to 
come in and be Kat,” coach Becky Burleigh said. “She’s an emotion-al leader as well as a fifth-year se-
nior with a ton of experience. But 
I think we can have other players step up in other ways.”
Sophomore Annie Bobbitt is 
one option. Against the Lobos, she started in place of Williamson and assisted on senior Erika Tym-rak’s equalizing goal in the 60th minute to put the game at 2-2. 
Bobbitt played for 68 minutes 
against New Mexico. Before Sun-day, she averaged 27.8 minutes in four games and did not see time 
against North Carolina on Aug. 
24.As a freshman, Bobbitt took on a major role at center back af-ter Katie Kadera’s career-ending ACL injury. 
Bobbitt appeared alongside 
Williamson during 17 starts at center, but  freshman Christen Westphal has started the most 
games alongside Williamson this 
season. “Whoever steps in is the 
coaches’ decision,” Bobbitt said. 
“If that happens to be me, or 
if that happens to be any of my other teammates, I’ll be cheering somebody.”
Junior Maggie Rodgers is also 
a candidate to see some time at center back. She appeared mostly at outside back throughout last season but played some minutes 
at center during the Gators’ 2012 
spring schedule. 
Rodgers saw her first action 
of the season Sunday, returning 
from a left ankle sprain to log 67 
minutes off the bench.
“It’s tough, because she hasn’t 
played and then she’s playing in a position she’s played spar -
ingly,” Burleigh said. “That’ll be something we’ll have to progress with.”
Burleigh hoped sophomore 
Karina Gutsche would fill Wil-
liamson’s spot immediately, but 
Gutsche suffered a concussion in practice last week after a ball bounced off the crossbar and 
hit her head. Her status remains 
day-to-day.
With Southeastern Conference 
play looming, the coaching staff 
will likely decide on a starting 
center back to pair with Westphal by Thursday.
“We have a lot of options of 
people that can play there,” Bur -
leigh said. “Certainly, we’re just hoping to hold down the fort un-til Kat gets back. But it’s a critical 
position for us, because we put a lot of responsibility on that posi-
tion in terms of communication. 
“It’s a big loss, but at the same 
time, in the end, we’ll have some-one who’s gained quite a bit of experience by the time Kat gets 
back.”TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 11, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 15

INTERCOLLEGIATE CHAMPIONSHIP ON MONDAY IN ATHENS, GA.
ADAM LICHTENSTEIN

Mike Alford and Florent Diep started 
the Florida men’s tennis team’s season on a 
high note on Monday.
The pair brought home the Gators’ first 
title after winning the Division I Doubles Title at the Southern Intercollegiate Cham-
pionships in Athens, Ga.
“We found a way to put it together,” Al-
ford said. “It went well.”
Alford and Diep defeated Mississippi 
State’s Jordan Angus and Pedro Dumont 
8-3 in the semifinals and then beat No. 43 
Dominique and Yannick Maden of Clem-son 8-5 to win the tournament.
“[Diep] and Mike did a great job of 
kind of battling through a couple of tough matches early,” coach Bryan Shelton said. 
“They found a way to win.”
The pair got better as the tournament 
went on, but Shelton acknowledged that the doubles team still has a lot of room to 
improve after this early-season tourna-ment.
This tournament was the first for Shel-
ton as Florida’s head coach. He previously coached the Georgia Tech women’s tennis 
team for 13 seasons.
“I don’t think there’s a ton of differences as far as coaching the players on the court,” Shelton said. “You’re always looking at 
game plans and how you prepare your ath-letes to go out there and compete.” 
“It was good to be out there with the 
guys this weekend. Obviously a lot of fun to see Mike and [Diep] finish off the tourna-
ment by winning the championship.”
The Gators had six players compete in 
Athens this weekend, including No. 17 Bob van Overbeek. Van Overbeek advanced to 
the quarterfinals before losing to Virginia Tech’s Andreas Bjerrehus in straight sets.
“His best tennis is still ahead of him,” 
Shelton said. “I expect him to get better 
every single week. …
When he’s firing on all 
cylinders, he’s tough to deal with out there.”
Alford also advanced 
to the quarterfinals in singles play, where he fell to Gonzales Austin of Vanderbilt, 
3-6, 6-3, 5-7.
Alford said the team needed to improve 
conditioning so they could go longer on the court without getting tired. According 
to Shelton, UF will spend more time on the track and in the pool to work on becoming 
a fitter team.
“We’ve identified those things and 
know that we’ve got to do a good job tak-ing care of our bodies and getting ourselves

When Camilla Hedberg shot a 69 (-3) 
on Sunday, she was just getting started. 
In the second day of the Cougar Clas-
sic, Hedberg turned in a round of 66 
(-6), which allowed her to move into first place.
“Camilla had a great round today,” 
coach Emily Bastel said. “She hit the ball well and gave herself a lot of looks at birdie.”
The sophomore started off the day by 
birdying her first hole. The only blem-
ish on her scorecard was a bogey on her 
third hole, but Hedberg immediately recovered and birdied six more holes before finishing the round. 
Hedberg’s second-straight under-par 
round allowed her to replace teammate Isabelle Lendl at the top of the leader -
board. However, Lendl didn’t fall too far. 
Lendl carded four birdies against two 
bogeys for a round of 70 (-2). The senior dropped to second place, but is still sev-en strokes under for the tournament and 
only two strokes behind Hedberg.
Senior Mia Piccio was the third Gator 
of the day to turn in an under-par round. 
Like Lendl, she finished the day with a score of 70 (-2). 
Florida only counted one round over 
par on Monday from freshman Ursa Orehek. Although Orehek wasn’t under 
par, she wasn’t too far off with a round 
of 73 (+1), which was a six stroke im-provement from Sunday’s round.
After ending the second day with a total of 279 (-9), Florida took over the lead from Southern California and are 
now three strokes ahead.
“I’m proud of how our seniors have 
played thus far,” Bastel said. “They re-
ally have been great leaders this week.”
While the women were moving into 
the top spot, the men were maintaining their No. 1 position at The Invitational at the Ocean Course. 
“We had another solid day,” coach 
Buddy Alexander said.
The Gators were able to extend their 
lead from four to 20 strokes thanks to Ty-ler McCumber, T.J. Vogel, A.J. Crouch, 
Santiago Gavino and 
J.D. Tomlinson finish-
ing Day 2 in the top 10. 
Senior McCum-
ber led the team once 
again as he turned in a round of 70 (-2), which consisted of five bird-
ies against a bogey and a double to keep 
him in second place.
Not far behind McCumber is Vogel, 
who finished one stroke shy of his team-
mate with a round of 71 (-1). Vogel’s 
three birdies against two bogeys moved 
him up from a nine-way tie for fifth place to third. 
Both seniors will be in the mix for the 
individual title as Florida wraps up the 
season’s first tournament today.
“Our top-two, Tyler McCumber and 
T.J. Vogel, played some great golf to-
day,” Alexander said.

Caleb Sturgis watched as his 51-yard kick 
ricocheted off the right upright and fell to the 
ground. However, Texas A&M coach Kevin 
Sumlin gave Sturgis two chances to pull Flori-
da within a touchdown of the lead. 
Sumlin’s timeout negated the first kick, so 
Sturgis split the uprights on his second try to make the score 17-10 shortly before halftime.
After kicking two field goals during the 
Gators’ 20-17 victory against the Aggies, the 
redshirt senior placekicker was named the 
Southeastern Conference Special Teams Player 
of the Week. This is the third time Sturgis has 
earned the award during his college career.
“He’s very accurate and very dependable,” 
UF coach Will Muschamp said. “He never gets shook, he just lines up and does his job.”
Sturgis’ first kick came at a critical time 
for Florida. Texas A&M had scored 14 unan-
swered points on back-to-back drives, averag-
ing 80 yards in length.
His 51-yard kick tallied the Gators’ first 
points since their opening touchdown drive.
The St. Augustine native’s second field 
goal was a 25-yard kick that cut Texas A&M’s 
lead to 17-13 on Florida’s first possession of the second half.
Sturgis’ 51-yarder was his seventh career 
field goal measuring 50 yards or more and his second this season. Against Bowling Green in 
the season opener, Sturgis made a 51-yard field 
goal that increased Florida’s lead to 27-14.
“In my two years as head coach, to have 
that opportunity to have a guy like him has just been a relief,” Muschamp said.
Offensive Injuries: Despite suffering a groin 
strain during Saturday’s victory, Mike Gil-lislee practiced on Monday and is expected to 
play against Tennessee.
So far this season, Gillislee has carried the 
ball 38 times for 231 yards and four touch-
downs, each of which have either tied the game or given Florida a lead.
During the 2012 campaign, Gillislee has 
seen an increased role under new offensive coordinator Brent Pease. The senior running back’s early success has raised questions re-garding his limited play behind Jeff Demps and Chris Rainey in 2011. Last season, Gillislee 
had just 56 carries despite averaging a team-
high 5.9 yards per carry.
“We were a little different schematically , 
offensively , last year,” Muschamp said. “There 
was never any lack of confidence in Mike Gil-
lislee.”
Matt Patchan’s strained pectoral muscle will keep him out for a third game. Last week, 
Muschamp said Patchan’s rehab was ahead of 
schedule and the oft-injured offensive lineman could potentially play against Tennessee.
Now Muschamp is hopeful for Patchan to 
return next week, but said the injury may side-line the redshirt junior until the bye week at the end of September.“I know Matt’s frustrated,” Muschamp 
said on Sept. 3. “I’m frustrated for him, be-cause he’s worked extremely hard. He had a really good offseason, so I hope it’s not that much longer.”
Saturday’s contest against the Volunteers 
will mark the 30th game Patchan has missed due to injury during his career at UF. He earned a medical redshirt after missing the en-tire 2010 season.
Chaz Green left Saturday’s game due to 
cramping, but there have been no further prob-lems with the Tampa native, who returned to 
practice on Monday.
“Chaz Green had some cramps, probably 
could have returned, but Kyle Koehne came in 
and did a nice job for us,” Muschamp said.
Debose Absent in Passing Game: Florida re-
ceivers have caught 26 passes from Jeff Driskel and Jacoby Brissett in 2012. Andre Debose has 
yet to record a reception.
When the depth chart was released on 
Aug. 27, Debose was listed as a backup behind Frankie Hammond Jr. at X receiver.
Brissett targeted Debose in the second 
quarter against Bowling Green on a deep post 
route, but the sophomore quarterback’s pass was overthrown.
Driskel said Debose’s lack of statistical con-
tributions was not a reflection on the wide re-
ceiver’s play.
“That’s not him — he’s not the one throw-
ing to himself,” Driskel said. “We have a bunch 
of playmakers. We’re trying to distribute the ball evenly. Obviously you have your progres-sions on each play. You don’t design them for certain people; you design them for certain 
routes. It’s not anything he’s done wrong.”
Muschamp said he has not had an issue 
with Debose’s play, praising his efforts in the 
ground game on Saturday.
“Andre Debose made a great block on the 
road that Gilly hit on their sideline for about 30 (yards) — an outstanding block to free us up there,” Muschamp said.
The junior wideout has seen most of his 
game action on special teams returning kick-
offs and punts. As a returner, he has amassed 
107 yards on six touches with one fumble.
