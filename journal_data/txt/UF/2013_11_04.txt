JACKSONVILLE — For three 
straight seasons, Will Muschamp 
and the Gators ﬁ  xed their eyes on the prize. If only they could get their hands on it.
Reaching the Southeastern Con-
ference Championship Game is Florida’s goal. Atlanta is the des-tination. Every December, the turf of the Georgia Dome plays host to perhaps the greatest opportunity in college football with the SEC and national titles on the line.
But for the third straight season, 
the turf at EverBank Field was lit-tered with missed opportunities. For the third straight season, the Gators fell short.
Georgia defeated Florida 23-20 
on Saturday evening, eliminat-ing the Gators (4-4, 3-3 SEC) from contention in the SEC Eastern Divi-sion.
Saturday’s loss guaranteed 
Muschamp a worse three-year SEC record than Ron Zook. 
The last time the Bulldogs (5-3, 
4-2 SEC) took three straight games in the rivalry, Will Muschamp was an 18-year-old living in Rome, Ga. — 70 miles away from Atlanta.
He is much farther away now 
after Florida’s third consecutive loss.
Atlanta is now an afterthought. A postseason berth of any kind is on the line.
With their No. 1 goal hanging in the balance, the Gators entered halftime trailing the Bulldogs 23-3, a lead too large for Florida to over-come. With SEC title aspirations on the line, the Gators were not pre-pared to ﬁ  ght.“We dug ourselves too big of a 
hole,” Muschamp said.
UF began digging from the start. 
UGA tailback Todd Gurley also grabbed a shovel.
With Florida and Georgia both vying for a spot in Atlanta last sea-son, Gurley buried the Gators with 118 rushing yards. He returned for an encore on Saturday, tallying 187 total yards and two touchdowns on 20 touches. 
The sophomore tailback’s largest 
play was a 73-yard catch-and-run touchdown from Aaron Murray in the ﬁ  rst quarter that increased the Bulldogs’ lead to 14-0. But the play took a toll on the sophomore, who returned to action after miss-ing Georgia’s previous three games with a high ankle sprain.
“After his long touchdown, his 
stomach got him a little bit,” Geor-gia coach Mark Richt said. “He was queasy. But we settled him down and he was ﬁ  ne after that.”
While Gurley helped UGA open 
up a large lead early, UF botched its share of chances.
The Gators missed one of two 
ﬁ  eld goal tries in the ﬁ  rst half and set up the Bulldogs for what would ultimately become the game-win-ning score.
Facing fourth and 10 at Geor-
gia’s 40-yard line with 1:18 remain-ing in the half, Muschamp elected to try for a ﬁ  rst down rather than punt the ball. Murphy completed a pass to Quinton Dunbar that lost three yards, giving UGA a short ﬁ  eld with 1:07 left on the clock.
The Bulldogs turned the mistake 
into three points on a 32-yard ﬁ  eld goal as time expired.
“If they had timeouts, I probably

From Thursday to Sunday, Gainesville 
was ﬁ  lled with bearded men, cut-off jean 
shorts and empty beer cans as Fest 12 at-tendees hopped venues.  
Fans from across the country are 
drawn to this beacon of punk-rock cul-ture, bringing with them travel stories and fond memories of past events along the way to Title Town.
Taylor Wingﬁ  eld said she braved the 
one-and-a-half day journey from Rich-mond, Va., to Gainesville in her boy-friend’s band’s van.
While the members of Hold Tight! sat 
huddled in the back, Wingﬁ  eld claimed the much-more-comfortable front seat for the trip. The group stopped over at a South Carolina hotel on the way.

For the ﬁ  rst time in four years, Gator Growl 
will sport a second stage in the Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium that will host two new performers.
Megan Harmon, producer of 2013’s Growl, 
wrote in an email that the team wanted to bring the audience nearer to the action by adding a second, closer stage. The stage, a 12-by-21 foot platform that will sit on the west 50-yard line, brings with it performances by UF student and juggler David Ferman and Josh Vietti, a hip-hop and pop violinist.
“Josh Vietti is something very different than 
we have ever seen at Gator Growl, and I think that is what makes him so spectacular,” she said.
She said the added platform doesn’t include 
much extra cost, as the Gator Growl team is us-ing the same company for the main stage.
UF industrial engineering senior Alex Wil-
liams, 21, said the second stage gives students a chance to get better seats for the show if their spot for the main stage wasn’t ideal.
“If they sell more tickets, they make more 
money, so the second stage is a good idea,” Williams said.Gator Growl adding a second stage

Recent alerts of a looming wine 
shortage aren’t making Gainesville 
residents put away their wine glasses quite yet.
A report released by Mor-
gan Stanley Research last week showed an upcoming undersup-ply of about 300 million cases of wine, CNN reported. 
The shortage could be attribut-
ed to higher demand, poor grow-ing conditions and a decrease in vineyards, USA Today reported.
But Nigel Smith, a UF profes-
sor who teaches Geography of Al-cohol, doesn’t think there’s going to be a wine shortage.
“It’s just going to shift the 
wine-growing areas to diversiﬁ  ed regions that didn’t … grow grapes before,” he said.
Smith said the industry used to 
be dominated by France and the Mediterranean region. 
Now, he said, Chile, Argentina, 
California, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand are all big pro-ducers. “I don’t see any major impacts 
in terms of prices and supply,” he said.
Bunky Mastin, co-owner of lo-
cal The Wine and Cheese Gallery, is not worried about the projected shortage yet.
The shortage won’t be an issue 
now but might be down the road, Mastin said. 
He said there are many differ-
ent sources around the world to get stock from.
“It’s not a problem because 
there’s so many wines out there,” Mastin said. “If we had serious droughts, then maybe it would be a problem.”
Every year, there are problems, 
sometimes oversupplies when grapes are plentiful, and some-times shortages due to droughts or heavy rain, he said.
The gallery won’t change to al-
ternative beverages anytime soon.
“We’re a wine store,” Mastin 
said.
Corrine Bullock, a 21-year-old 
UF applied physiology and kine-siology senior, is a fan of penny wine at Beef ‘O’ Brady’s. If the price went up, people would prob-ably be less likely to go, she said.
“A wine shortage would most 
likely end penny wine as we know it,” she said.Locals show little concern 
about wine shortageNov. 7, 1977
A City Commission group 
proposed making pornogra-phy shops spread through-out the city, rather than being clustered in one area. Gaines-ville’s Human Resources and Services Committee based its opinion off of knowledge of Boston’s and Hollywood’s issues with similar situa-tions. The members, howev-er, didn’t want to try to de-ﬁ  ne pornography by speciﬁ  c terms, so they wouldn’t be limited in restrictions.
Nov. 4, 1987Crop dusters took on a 
new nickname: butterﬂ  y hitmen. Pesticides sprayed to control mosquitos were linked to the dwindling num-bers of Schaus Swallowtails, a rare species of butterﬂ  y. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service asked a UF zoolo-gist to investigate the species populations. He only found one of the butterﬂ  ies on Key Largo, which used to have a population of 70.
Nov. 7, 1994A UF freshman learned 
why windows in Las Ve-gas don’t open. In an at-tempt to get a better view of an outdoor movie play-ing at a nearby building, she jumped from her dorm window down onto a 4-foot ledge below. Unable to stop her fall, she fell off that ledge and down four stories to the ground, narrowly missing a tree in the process. Police ofﬁ  cials said no alcohol was involved.
Nov. 4, 2009Santa Fe College said no to 
saying “no.” Despite student senators all agreeing smok-ing was a problem for their campus, they voted down a motion to create a campus-wide ban, which would fol-low UF’s lead. The reason-ing behind the decision was smokers would congregate in parking lots, which would lead to more accidents. How-ever, student senators did agree to provide better en-forcement to the existing smoking restrictions, such as smoking only in designated smoking huts.

A member of the audience crowd surfs during a performance by 1994! as part of Fest 12 at The Atlantic 
on Saturday. The four-day Gainesville music festival brought many underground rock bands to downtown. 
Friends, music motivators
Others used a combination 
of methods to reach Gainesville, 
though the transitions complicated the journey.
Sean Lachut, a freelancer for the 
Center for Inquiry, said he flew from Chicago into Tampa before driving north to Gainesville for Fest.
Lachut said he missed his con-
nection in Atlanta, leaving him with a full day of waiting in an airport hotel. Then, when he boarded his plane, it experienced technical dif-ficulties before takeoff.
“There was something wrong 
with the wing,” he said. “This dude was working on it with what looked like a paperclip, and I just thought ‘Is this where I die?’”
Jon Pearce, who traveled from 
Detroit to attend Fest, said his jour-ney was an exhausting one.
“I ended up knocking out for two 
hours in an Orlando baggage claim,” Pearce said.
But the trip to a punk-rock mecca 
was well worth it. Pearce, who has come to Fest for three years in a row, said the shows were incredible.
On the way to see a show at 
the Florida Theater of Gainesville, Pearce ran into the lead singer of BoySetsFire, Nathan Gray. The two shook hands while Pearce praised Gray for his performance.
“You guys played a f****** awe-
some set,” he said.
Pearce said the punk community 
is extremely tight-knit. Most fans have met performers or know them personally.
New Yorker Barrie Cohn has 
been coming to Fest every year since its sixth iteration. It’s that sense of community that keeps the 32-year-old coming back every year.
Cohn stood next to Will Romeo, 
who’s been a friend for more than a decade.
Romeo, a band member of  Game-
day Regulars, said he followed the punk scene in New York City when he was 16, but it has declined along with music in general.
“That’s why I come to Fest,” he 
said. “It’s just the Super Bowl of punk rock.”fest , from page 1HALLEY WHARTON

With the Reitz Union construction set to continue until 
2015, some UF students, faculty and visitors are considering 
the project an ear sore.
Eddie Daniels, the executive director of the Reitz Union, 
said the construction workers generally work from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m., and noisy work is restricted to an 8 a.m. start time. Select after-hours work is scheduled as needed with the ap-proval of the university.
As of last week, Daniels said he is “not 
aware of any complaints” from the faculty relating to the noise.
But Kim Walsh-Childers, a professor at 
the College of Journalism and Communi-cations, said her class is disrupted by the noise every Tuesday and Thursday morn-ing.
Walsh-Childers said when the old col-
onnade was torn down it was very loud, 
and she wishes it would have been demolished during sum-mer.
Daniels said the only official complaints he has heard re-
gard the inconveniences connected with the rerouted access into the Reitz Union.
With the rumble of construction, the Reitz Union Hotel 
staff is also worried about potential complaints.
Alexandra Webel, a front desk assistant at the hotel, said 
the noises from the renovations are starting to pick up.
“We’re concerned with how it’s going to go with the holi-
days coming,” Webel said.
The staff is also worried that guests will want to change 
rooms because of the noise, but the hotel does not have any extra space to accommodate them, she said. 
Students who have classes near the Reitz Union have also 
found the loud noises from the construction site to be disrup-tive.
Kelsey Wonderlin, a 20-year-old UF journalism junior, 
hears the construction during her class in McCarty Hall.
“The construction going on at the Reitz makes it hard to 
pay attention in class,” Wonderlin said. “I find myself always getting distracted by the noises.”
The $75 million project is expecting to be completed by 
Fall 2015.
The next two years are “going to be noisy,” Walsh-
Childers said. “There’s not really any way to make it quiet.” Reitz construction

The weekend ended on a high note for UF’s co-ed 
competitive a cappella group. No Southern Accent 
auditioned for producers of “America’s Got Talent” Sunday evening in Atlanta and landed a second au-dition in front of executive producers.
For the first audition, the singers performed seg-
ments of “Holy Grail” by Jay-Z featuring Justin Timberlake; “Radioactive” by Imagine Dragons; and “Bring Me to Life” by Evanescence.
Alex Greene, the group’s musical director, said 
producers reached out to the group about a month and a half ago after viewing some of their perfor-mances on YouTube. The singers were given a pre-ferred audition, allowing them to skip the long lines of people waiting for a chance to perform.“It weighs on the importance of social media,” 
the 22-year-old UF materials science and engineer-ing senior said.
The 17-member group made the six-hour trip to 
the audition venue, AmericasMart Atlanta, on Sun-day morning.
After impressing the first round of producers, 
the a cappella group sang “Radioactive” again for executive producers.
“They seemed like they liked us,” Greene said.As far as the results of the audition, Greene said 
it depends on what the producers want. They will hear back from “America’s Got Talent” in January.
“There’s a ton of talented people,” he said. 
“You’ve got to be in it to win it.”
Twenty-one-year-old UF criminology senior and 
business management master’s student C.J. Wittus, the group’s president, said the singers were excited for the audition.
Alissa Kotranza, a 20-year-old UF journalism ju-
nior and the group’s performance director, said the choreography fit with robotic, sharp movements and freestyle.
She said this was the group’s first audition for a 
talent-based competitive television show.No Southern Accent’s got talent

Alachua County and Gainesville 
may be joined by the federal govern-
ment as a bill that promises to end employment discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity gains traction in the Senate.
Terry Fleming, the co-president 
of the Pride Community Center of North Central Florida, said that Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) and Rep. Corrine Brown (D-Fla.) have both signed on as sponsors of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act.
The proposed bill, which is ex-
pected to enter the Senate floor to-day, would join ordinances that are already in effect in Gainesville and ones that will take effect in Alachua County on Jan. 1. 
These ordinances, enforced by the local offices of equal opportu-nity, protect anyone from being dis-criminated based on orientation or identity in the fields of employment, housing or public accommodations, said Jacqueline Chung, equal oppor-tunity manager for Alachua County. The protection would join already existing ones against women, dis-ability status or other human rights violations.
Chung, who said the ordinance 
passed on Aug. 13 of this year, said anyone who feels like he or she has been wronged can file a complaint, and the equal opportunity office will investigate it.
She said the county protection 
was added after Gainesville adopt-ed its own in 2008. When the county was doing its periodic review, she said it decided to add its own pro-tection.
“We thought it was timely and 
the right thing to do,” she said.
Chung said only about 16 other 
counties or cities have similar ordi-nances, but it was “only a matter of time” until it spreads.
Fleming said passing the Em-
ployment Non-Discrimination Act will be an uphill battle, especially in the House. But he said it’s an im-portant step to national equalization that must be done.
“If the federal law passed, it 
would provide protection across the entire country, not just spotty ones,” he said.

� FLORIDA HAS EXONERATED 24 
DEATH ROW INMATES SINCE 1973.
CHRIS ALCANTARA
Alligator Staff Writer calcantara@alligator.org
In a Broward County courtroom on Dec. 
21, Seth Penalver sat quietly next to his lawyer, 
waiting to hear the jury’s verdict for a 1994 tri-ple murder he claimed he didn’t commit. 
After 18 years behind bars — six of which 
he spent on death row — and three trials, he got his answer: not guilty on all charges.
He wept into his hands as his lawyers em-
braced him. He kneeled in front of his seat and prayed. From that day on, he was a free man. 
Almost a year since his release, Penalver, 
40, said he still remembers the feeling of being acquitted in a case that became well-known in Broward County. 
“It was surreal,” he said.Penalver spoke about his exoneration to 
about 50 people Saturday inside the St. Au-gustine Church and Catholic Student Center in Gainesville. Herman Lindsey, a 40-year-old Broward County resident who was acquitted of a 12-year-old murder case in 2009, also talk-ed about his experience. 
Gainesville Citizens for Alternatives to 
the Death Penalty partnered with Witness to Innocence to bring Penalver and Lindsey to Gainesville.
“There’s a lot of people who don’t follow 
the issue of the death penalty,” said GCADP co-coordinator Miriam Elliott. “They certainly don’t know how many (death row inmates) have been exonerated in Florida. They don’t know the stories behind them.” 
�       �           �
Since 1973, Florida has exonerated 24 death 
row inmates — the highest in the United States.
Death row inmates can have their convic-
tions overturned if they show legal error or new evidence that supports their innocence. This can include government misconduct, such as state prosecutors withholding evi-dence during trial, eyewitness error or DNA analysis. Lindsey and Penalver were Florida’s most recent exonerated cases. 
In 2006, the Florida Supreme Court grant-
ed Penalver a retrial after he was sentenced to death in 1999 for the murders of a Miramar club owner and two women. One of the jus-tices’ rulings said the quality of security foot-age shot inside the club owner’s house during the murder was so poor that they couldn’t de-termine if Penalver was the gunman. 
That same year, Lindsey 
was convicted for a 1994 murder of a Ft. Lauderdale pawnshop owner. The jus-tices, however, later voted to overturn Lindsey’s death sentence conviction, say-
ing state prosecutors didn’t have enough evidence to prove he shot and killed the 
owner. 
Richard C. Dieter, executive director of the 
Death Penalty Information Center in Wash-ington, D.C., said with 80 people executed in Florida since 1979, one person is exonerated for every three executions. 
“That’s a terrible ratio,” he said. “That means there’s far too many mistakes being made.”
With the recent passing of the Timely Jus-
tice Act, which will speed up death penalty sentences limiting the time innocent inmates have to appeal their cases, Penalver and Lind-sey said the death penalty in Florida should be abolished.  
“The system is wrong,” Penalver said. “If 
you get it wrong one time, that’s all it takes.”
�       �           �
While Lindsey and Penalver now live as 
free men, they say life as exonerees has been difficult. 
Employment is hard to find, especially 
with murder charges attached to their records. They’re also not eligible for state compensa-tion because of prior felony convictions. 
“We still live in a death sentence,” Lindsey 
said.
Penalver said he’s decided not to let his 
time in prison affect the rest of his life. 
“I gotta let it go,” he said. “I don’t know 
how much time I have left, but I want to go out and enjoy it.”

“I❤Boobies!” bracelets may 
soon be the center of a U.S. Supreme 
Court case as a school district in Pennsylvania plans to appeal a fed-eral court’s ruling that has allowed the bracelets in schools.
But some Gainesville residents 
say the thick plastic bands aren’t a big deal, especially because the phrase is advocating a good cause. 
Lindy Brounley, communica-
tions director for the UF Health Cancer Center, said that any kind of health education or awareness project is positive. She said women between the ages of 40 and 70 need to get annual mammograms to help detect cancer early, and any cam-paigns that encourage that are ben-eficial.   
The bracelets are put out by 
Keep A Breast Foundation, which promotes prevention and early de-tection.Emily King, a 19-year-old Santa 
Fe elementary education sopho-more, said she is well aware of the bracelets, but she doesn’t find them offensive.
“Breast cancer is a serious prob-
lem, and we can’t just sweep it un-der the rug because it might be un-comfortable to talk about,” she said. 
King said the bracelets send a 
message similar to the American Cancer Society’s Making Strides Against Breast Cancer walk that she’s participated in locally. 
“Just like how the walk provides 
a great opportunity for survivors to get together, the bracelets provide a way to start a conversation with someone that may ask you about what you’re wearing,” she said.
Christian Gonzalez, a 20-year-
old UF political science sophomore, said he thinks first amendment rights extend to the bracelets be-cause they are not derogatory.
“If it had any explicit words or images, I would consider it inap-propriate,” he said. “But the brace-lets are just a relaxed approach to a powerful meaning.”
Gonzalez said he doesn’t see the 
issue going as far as the U.S. Su-preme Court.
“I think it is pretty clear here 
that if the bracelets don’t disrupt the education environment, kids should be able to wear them,” he said. “Unless they are going to ban bracelets all together, then I think these Pennsylvania students will be able to proudly wear their support for breast cancer.”
'Boobies' bracelets could go to court� A FRIDAY ACCIDENT 
NEAR WALDO WAS FATAL.

A 45-year-old Callahan man 
died Friday morning after he 
was thrown from his SUV dur-ing a rollover crash two miles northwest of Waldo.
Timothy Wayne Spruiell 
was headed east on County Road 225 at 12:20 a.m., when he tried to make a sharp right turn and lost control of his 2003 Chevrolet Avalanche, accord-ing to a Florida Highway Patrol crash report.
The SUV veered off the road 
onto a grassy shoulder, and while Spruiell tried to correct the vehicle by steering to the right, it overturned and rolled over several times along the roadway.
Spruiell, who did not wear 
a seatbelt, was ejected from the SUV.
When troopers arrived, they 
pronounced Spruiell dead at the scene. They also determined he was driving more than 60 mph in a 55 mph speed zone.
FHP spokeswoman Tracy 
Hisler-Pace said Saturday that the Alachua County Medical Examiner’s Office will perform an autopsy to see if Spruiell was intoxicated at the time of the crash. 
No one else was injured.

A 39-year-old Gainesville 
woman was arrested Friday morning after she allegedly at-tacked her 70-year-old mother.
Crystal Marie Ross was 
charged with battery on an el-derly person, according to a Gainesville Police arrest report. 
At about 4 a.m. Friday, Ross 
punched her mother in the chest during an argument. She also pulled her mother’s hair and tried to choke her, police said. 
Officers booked Ross into 
the Alachua County Jail, where she remained Sunday night in lieu of $50,000 bond.

A 29-year-old Gainesville 
man was arrested Saturday night after police say he tried to eat a marijuana cigarette when an officer pulled him and an-other man over. 
Michael Warren II was 
charged with marijuana pos-session and tampering with evidence, according to a Gainesville Police arrest report. 
At about 10:30 p.m. Satur-
day, Officer Jeremiah Kelly pulled over a car on the 400 block of Northeast 18th Street after he noticed the driver wasn’t wearing his seatbelt. After Kelly walked up to the car, the driver allowed him to search inside, according to the report. 
Kelly noticed Warren sitting 
in the backseat and found a small piece of marijuana on his lap. Kelly asked if Warren had any drugs on him. He refused to answer and started to make a “chewing motion” with his mouth, according to the report. 
Kelly ordered Warren to 
open his mouth and found a “significant amount” of mari-juana in it.
Warren said he ate the mari-
juana cigarette because he got scared when police pulled the car over. 
Warren was booked into jail 
and has since been released, ac-cording to jail records. Roundup: weekend

toward drone 
strikes is appalling
President Barack Obama’s use of drone strikes abroad is 
a polarizing debate, and the legality and secrecy of the strikes is often called into question by lawmakers. The 
public’s top concern over the strikes, according to the Pew Re-search Center, is the potential endangerment of civilians’ lives. 
However, a recent Congressional hearing in which ﬁ  ve 
lawmakers met with survivors of a drone attack was met with disappointing coverage in the media. What was even more dis-appointing, however, was the lack of turnout by members of Congress. Only ﬁ  ve representatives showed up. 
The survivors — a schoolteacher, Raﬁ  q ur Rehman and his 
two children — presented a harrowing account of a U.S. drone attack that killed Rehman’s mother and injured the two children in a remote tribal region of Pakistan last October. 
According to Common Dreams, a nonproﬁ  t independent 
news center, “’Nobody has ever told me why my mother was targeted that day,’ Raﬁ  q wrote in an open letter to President Obama last week. ‘The media reported that the attack was on a car, but there is no road alongside my mother’s house. Several reported the attack was on a house. But the missiles hit a nearby ﬁ  eld, not a house. All reported that ﬁ  ve militants were killed. Only one person was killed — a 65-year-old grandmother of nine.’
“’But the United States and its citizens probably do not know 
this,’ Raﬁ  q continued. ‘No one ever asked us who was killed or injured that day. Not the United States or my own government. Nobody has come to investigate nor has anyone been held ac-countable.’”
He concluded, ‘Quite simply, nobody seems to care.’”Rehman’s 13-year-old son, Zubair, gave a heartbreaking 
statement. 
“I no longer love blue skies,” he said. “In fact, I now prefer 
grey skies. Drones don’t ﬂ  y when sky is grey.” 
The family’s testimony reportedly caused the translator to 
break down in tears during the hearing. 
Outside of The Guardian, The New Yorker and Al Jazeera 
America, the hearing has received little attention from American media. And, hello, only ﬁ  ve representatives showed up to listen to the Rehmans’ gut-wrenching testimony: Rep. Alan Grayson (D-Fla.), who called the hearing, Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.), Rep. Janice Schakowsky (D-Ill.), Rep. Rush Holt (D-N.J.) and Rep. Rick Nolan (D-Minn.). 
Americans — especially lawmakers and the media — seem 
to be content with inaction. Aside from grassroots protests, the drone strikes seem to be met with collective apathy. 
Holocaust survivor and professor Elie Wiesel said, “We must 
take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Si-lence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented.”
The drone problem is no longer rooted simply in politics. 
Civilian lives are endangered, and attacks such as the one on Rehman’s family, with no rhyme or reason, prove that power is going unchecked within the federal government. Writers should be compensated for work
Everyone knows the world we live in is increasingly 
centered on technology — its invention, design, construction, marketing and — most importantly — 
its use. Science, technology, engineering and math careers abound and STEM-major students receive incentives for choosing more “worthwhile” tracks. Such a society de-nounces the humanities and its subﬁ  elds. 
Without a doubt, STEM majors are treated with more 
respect than anyone majoring in the ﬁ  ne arts or anything that falls under the umbrella of liberal arts. Unfortunately, this sentiment is beginning to extend beyond the univer-sity. The attitude that humanities disciplines are of lesser value has become all the more prevalent in the working world we’re trying to enter.
How are the humanities devalued in the real world? 
We could try to count the ways, but this column has a maximum word count. However, the best representative of this is described in “Slaves of the Internet, Unite!,” an article by New York Times contributor Tim Kreider.
Kreider explains that, even after graduation, much of a 
writer’s work is done for free. He is regularly asked to con-tribute to other publications as well with no reimburse-ment, and with The New York Times on his resume, that’s a little shocking.
It makes sense for undergraduates to take unpaid in-
ternships and submit to papers, magazines and websites for no money to build their portfolios. Between the pub-lished sample and the exposure, submitting for free is proﬁ  table in its own way. Getting “paid” in exposure and contributor copies is perfectly acceptable pre-graduation. Accepting anything less than actual money later on is det-rimental to society’s perception of the value of good writ-ing, art, music and more.
Maybe the artsy folk are asked to produce for free be-
cause they would produce with or without being proposi-tioned. After all, they chose to follow a passion as a career. This is a scary thought process because it implies STEM folks feel no connection to their profession, which is completely false. Even worse, it conveys to those with talent in the humani-ties that there is no reward in cultivating it, that no amount of prowess will be rewarded in the ways it should.
Shouldn’t writers be ﬂ  attered 
they’re being asked to contrib-
ute? Yes and no, because while their work may have been chosen above that of others, apparently it’s still not worth paying a penny for.
As online publishing gains traction, it’s getting even 
harder for writers to make their work — and it is work — seem tangible enough to deserve pay. 
Once a degree hangs securely on the wall, solicit opin-
ions on your portfolio and resume from professionals in the ﬁ  eld. If they conﬁ  rm it’s up to par, the time has come to stop accepting zilch for your work. That goes for you too, artists, photographers and musicians.
By accepting no pay for their work, writers conﬁ  rm 
their craft has no value and validate a client’s decision to withhold any tangible reimbursement, even though writ-ing is a specialized skill. When one person conﬁ  rms his or her work has no value, that message will be applied to every writer, artist and so on in the future.
If we can collectively agree that what we do has merit 
and assert that in all of our business interactions, maybe others will treat us as though that is the case. Until then, start drafting your rejection emails to all the jerkholes who think your material isn’t worth commissioning the right way. 
Rest assured they’d never ask for a free haircut, and 
feel free to point that out to them.

a small gathering around a bonﬁ  re into one of the na-tion’s largest, student-produced pep rallies, and this year’s entertainment line-up is terriﬁ  c.
With student-produced skits, ﬁ  reworks, 
a multitude of cameos, student organization performances and musical acts The Fray, Sister Hazel and New Directions Veterans Choir, Gator Growl 2013 promises to be one 
you don’t want to miss.

In an effort to stem the tide of millions of Americans us-
ing government handouts to put food on the table, major cuts to the nation’s food stamp program went into effect 
last week. Conservatives cheer it as a way to cut additional government waste, while liberals recall the days when mil-lions of Americans lived in poverty, unable to feed their families. 
An estimated 47.6 million 
Americans are on food stamps, and the cuts will reduce food stamps by $5 billion. In many cas-es, the reductions will drastically reduce struggling Americans’ ability to feed their families.
Many conservatives in this 
country have a strange and downright terrifying way of deal-ing with the plight of impoverished Americans: Cut govern-ment beneﬁ  ts and refuse to raise the minimum wage. Re-gardless of how you feel on each issue, it’s a double-edged sword, whether conservatives realize it. 
If we cut food stamps, then we must raise the minimum 
wage to help lift the drastically underpaid out of poverty. If we don’t raise the minimum wage, we can’t cut food stamps; it’s that simple.
At this point, you might think I’m very wrong and that 
a strong capitalist society without government interference will pay workers what they’re worth. Tell that to McDon-ald’s, which pays its average employee less than $9 an hour and even has a telephone line to help employees sign up for food stamps and welfare programs. 
We live in a country where we allow the wealthiest Amer-
icans to pay their employees like crap, while the American taxpayer subsidizes the wealthy by providing their employ-ees with welfare programs. 
American capitalism, baby! It’s awesome! I’m not suggesting we increase the minimum wage to 
something unsustainable, but if we want to cut government programs like food stamps, then at the very least, businesses must pick up the slack. 
Honestly, do you think companies like Wal-Mart and 
McDonald’s will really hurt if they start paying workers just a couple more dollars per hour? Sure, it adds up, but we’re talking about some of the wealthiest companies in the world that continue to abuse U.S. taxpayers by forcing them to pick up the slack. 
Assistance programs help the poorest of Americans, but 
you can’t deny that it feels as if we’re actually assisting the companies who pay low wages to American workers. It’s a morally bankrupt system, and while the fat cats count their money and hope for bigger proﬁ  ts, members of Congress are trying to kill the very system low-wage employees count on to survive. 
Those against programs like the Supplemental Nutri-
tional Assistance Program argue we don’t need assistance programs because everyone is abusing the system. By that rationale, if someone cuts in line at Disney World, we should shut down the entire ride, right?
We can’t turn our backs on millions of struggling Ameri-
cans just because of the cost or the rare abuse of the system.
In the 1960s, our leaders made it a point to ﬁ  nd ways to 
lift millions of people out of poverty and hunger. They real-ized a country unwilling to help those less fortunate was no country at all. Countless people are alive today because at some point, government assistance was all they had. 
We live in a time when millions of Americans are out of 
work or are working jobs that barely afford them enough to feed themselves, let alone their families or pay any other bills. You can cut food stamps and other assistance programs all you want, but it doesn’t get to the root of the problem. 
Many Americans aren’t making enough to survive.We live in a time when the cost of living is going up, yet 
wages, especially for the middle and lower class, remain woefully stagnant. If the government can’t help them, who will? Sadly, it feels as if many of our elected ofﬁ  cials are conducting an experiment in social Darwinism using the American people as research subjects. Continue to cut gov-ernment assistance and keep wages low, and once again, we will see millions living in poverty or worse.

paigning. His column runs on Mondays. Love them or hate

The alligatorSports crew would like to extend our best wishes to Amanda Brooks, who is leaving the UAA to work for USA Track and Field. Congratulations!Poll Question
Will the Gators become bowl eligible this season? Vote online at 
alligatorSports.org. JACKSONVILLE — Could it have gone any worse? Flor-ida falls behind early only to knock on victory’s door, have it swing open and smack it in the face.
If Saturday ended at halftime, this column would’ve been 
a rip job on a splintered Gators team. A team that looked like 
it didn’t want to play. A team that looked down, dejected and disinterested in a game that could save its season for another week.
Instead, this is a rallying cry — an open letter to Florida fans 
and students. It may have taken a ﬂ  uky fumble recovery by Leon Orr and a leaping Mack Brown to wake the Gators up, but they still need your support.
That support appeared to be dwindling for the nation’s 
110th-ranked offense and a defense that headed into Satur-day more porous than Swiss cheese. A fan donning an orange shirt, sitting on the Florida side of EverBank Field, ﬂ  ipped coach Will Muschamp the bird when he walked into the tunnel following the game. Florida students were more con-cerned about heading to Tallahassee for a top-10 matchup and the Rivalry Music Festival.
There’s good reason to give up. 
The personal fouls get old. The nega-
tive offensive plays get old. The losses are old. 
Signing two offensive linemen in the 2011 and 2012 classes 
has left Florida thin at the position where it can least afford to be. Going from Spurrier’s offense, to Urban’s Tebow-led of-fense, to an offensive offense has made Florida a social-media punch line on game day.
An unexpected 83-yard pass play to Quinton Dunbar on 
Saturday led to no points as Francisco Velez missed a 40-yard ﬁ  eld goal try. Austin Hardin, after his missed 47-yard attempt later in the game, stared at the ﬁ  eld-goal posts, hands on hips, as if to ask, “What the heck happened?”
After eight games, a better question for these Gators could 
be: “Why bother? There’s nothing to play for.” 
Still, redshirt junior Mack Brown said it best following the 
game. While some form of the word “frustration” spewed out of every player’s mouth, including his, the running back had this to say:
“We’ve got the Gator on our helmet and the names on our PHILLIP HEILMAN
Alligator Staff Writer @phillip_heilman
JACKSONVILLE — You won’t 
ﬁ  nd a more impressive start to a game than the one Todd Gurley en-joyed Saturday.
Led by the sophomore tailback’s 
remarkable ﬁ  rst quarter, Georgia raced out to a quick lead and held on late to earn a 23-20 victory at Ev-erBank Field.
“We played tremendously in 
the ﬁ  rst half, then gave them some life and got their blood pumping,” Georgia coach Mark Richt said. “It could’ve turned bad, but we got some big stops on defense, and the offense ﬁ  nished with that beautiful drive.”
During the Bulldogs’ opening 
drive, Gurley showed no effects of the sprained ankle that kept him sidelined the past three games.
On the second play from scrim-
mage, he caught a pass from quar-terback Aaron Murray and gained 14 yards. Four plays later, his ﬁ  rst handoff of the game went for a bruising 25 yards. 
He capped the drive on the next 
play, barreling into the end zone for 
Ryan Jones / Alligator
Georgia quarterback Aaron Murray (11) hands off the football to running back Todd Gurley (3) during Florida’s

ADAM LICHTENSTEIN
Alligator Staff Writer @alichtenstein24
JACKSONVILLE — Flor-
ida got the third-down stop 
it needed with time running out in the fourth quarter.
Unfortunately for the 
Gators, defensive lineman Darious “Bear” Cummings was ﬂ  agged for illegal hands to Bulldogs running back Todd Gurley’s face. 
The personal foul cost UF 
the stop and, ultimately, the game. 
Florida (4-4, 3-3 South-
eastern Conference) racked up 70 yards on seven record-ed penalties in its 23-20 loss to Georgia (5-3, 4-2 SEC) on Saturday at EverBank Field.
Had it not been for several 
offsetting personal foul calls, that number could have been even worse.
But penalties are nothing 
new to the Gators. They have more penalty yards than any other team in the conference the past two seasons.
“We’ve led the SEC in 
penalties 20 out of 24 years, ﬁ  rst or second,” coach Will Muschamp said. “It was long before I got here.”
The ﬂ  ags started early 
and showed no signs of stop-ping.
A UF defensive lineman 
jumped offside during UGA’s ﬁ  rst possession, but Georgia declined the penalty.
The penalties continued 
when the Gators got the ball.
Defensive back Brian 
Poole was ﬂ  agged for an ille-gal block on the kickoff, but his was not the most costly 
penalty of 
the drive.
Referees 
called a per-sonal foul on receiver Solomon  Patton on a 2-yard rush 
by Kelvin Taylor on third down.
Redshirt junior kicker 
Francisco Velez came on to kick what would have been a 25-yard ﬁ  eld goal if not for the penalty. Instead, he missed a 40-yard kick.
The game became chippy 
in the third quarter.
Patton received a handoff 
from quarterback Tyler Mur-phy, and Georgia safety Josh Harvey-Clemons tackled him out of bounds. 
Referees ﬂ  agged Harvey-
Clemons for a horse-collar tackle, and players from both teams converged on the side-line.
After jawing from both 
teams, referees called un-sportsmanlike conduct fouls Penalties plague UF 
in loss to rival UGA

With an offseason plagued by injuries and 
suspensions, coach Billy Donovan has had 
only five of his 13 players consistently at prac-tice: Kasey Hill, DeVon Walker, Casey Prath-er, Patric Young and Jacob Kurtz.
So when it came time to announce the start-
ers for Friday night’s exhibition game against Florida Southern, Donovan decided to reward the unfailing five, including Kurtz, who is a walk-on and formerly served as the team’s manager.
The junior had never earned a start for 
Florida in either a regular season or exhibi-tion game. But without Damontre Harris and Dorian Finney-Smith, who were both sus-pended Thursday for violating team rules, Donovan needed another player.
Kurtz showed he could become a viable 
option even when the suspended players re-turn, scoring 11 points on 5-of-6 shooting and recording nine rebounds, tying Will Yeguete for the team lead, during Florida’s 110-88 vic-tory.
“What you saw out there (Friday), I see ev-
ery day in practice,” Donovan said. “I think he can really help us. He’s a really smart player. I think he deserved and earned the opportunity to start.”
Hill, who started at point guard in place 
of the suspended Scottie Wilbekin, also made the most of his opportunity.
The former McDonald’s All-American 
shined offensively in the first half with 14 points on 6-of-9 shooting. However, Hill add-ed only three free throws in the second half while missing his next four shots from the field.
The point guard’s three turnovers were 
too many while his three assists were too few, Donovan said after the game. But Florida’s coach added that was to be expected from a freshman point guard.
“I thought he showed some really great 
glimpses in transition and open floor passes,” Donovan said. “Obviously he’s a freshman. He’s going to have some growing pains (and) some ups and downs. He had some turnovers. He didn’t have a high number of assists, but certainly his explosiveness in the open floor showed.”
Hill said the easiest part of the game was at-
tacking the basket. Five of his six scores were layups, and three of those shots came on fast breaks. But after one game, the freshman said he needs to work on holding onto the ball.
“Those turnovers were very important 
turnovers,” he said. “I can’t turn the ball over like that and be careless and sloppy with the ball, so I definitely got to get better at that.”
Prather, who has averaged 3.1 points per 
game during his three years with the Gators, led all players with 23 points, seven assists and four steals. In the 2012-13 season, Prather averaged only one assist and fewer than one steal per game, but he surpassed those num-bers Friday by filling in at point guard when-ever Hill was on the bench.
After failing to average even one point or 
rebound per game last year as a freshman, DeVon Walker recorded 11 points and eight rebounds against Florida Southern.
But Donovan seemed most impressed 
with Young, who not only gave the Gators 19 points and eight rebounds, but also showed he had the conditioning to move up and down the court without problem.
“I thought Patric had a really good motor 
(Friday),” Donovan said. “I thought he was very aggressive. I thought he came out pas-sionate. 
“We need that kind of consistency out of 
him really every game. That’s the expectation I would have for Patric.”Walk-on takes advantage of 
opportunity in exhibition win

It took one lucky bounce for the 
Gators to maintain their Southeastern 
Conference title aspirations in College Station, Texas. 
A service ace by junior libero Tay-
lor Unroe that hit the tape on the top of the net gave No. 5 Florida a win in the fifth set (24-26, 25-23, 25-8, 24-26, 16-14) against Texas A&M. 
“We rode [Unroe’s] serve today,” 
coach Mary Wise said. “I don’t think any Texas A&M fan would want her to be going back to serve down there with the score tied and match point on the line. She stepped up big.” 
The Aggies had multiple chances to 
put the match away, including a 14-13 match point in the fifth set before the Gators rallied for three straight points to claim the victory. 
Winning the match was critical for 
Florida, which remains in the hunt for a record 20th SEC regular season title.
No. 7 Missouri swept No. 19 Ken-
tucky on Sunday to stay undefeated and atop the conference.   Needing a win, the Gators turned to 
Chloe Mann, who had one of the most dominating performances of her career. 
The redshirt senior middle blocker 
recorded a career-high 22 kills to go along with her team-leading .606 hitting percentage.
Freshman 
outside hitter Alex Holston was also help-
ful for the Gators, setting a career high with 21 kills on a .459 hitting percent-age. 
“[Mann and Holston] were just ter-
rific throughout the entire match in terms of, you know, they’re all over ev-eryone’s scouting report and how hard they work to get those kills,” Wise said. ”Those were not easy kills.”
That hitting combination saved Flori-
da from disaster as the rest of the offense struggled against Texas A&M. 
Sophomore outside hitters Gabby 
Mallette and Ziva Recek had 10 kills each, but neither hit better than .133.

Agata Strausa’s consistent improvement 
during 2013 was one of the reasons the Gators 
looked poised to live up to their predicted sec-ond-place finish at the Southeastern Conference Championships on Friday. 
After leading Florida in the three of her races 
prior to the SEC Championships, the redshirt senior did not disappoint.
She kept up with the lead group for the en-
tire race to finish fourth out of 119 runners, post-ing a career-best time of 20:17.79 — the seventh fastest 6K on the Mark Bostick Golf Course and 33.27 seconds faster than her time on Florida’s home course earlier this year.
The three runners Strausa fell to individu-
ally — Dominique Scott, Shannon Klenke and Grace Heymsfield — were from Arkansas, which won the meet.
“She’s looked great in practice since Wiscon-
sin, and we’ve felt like she was ready to contend for the title,” coach Paul Spangler said. “She put herself in a position and with 400 [meters] to go, it was whoever had the best foot speed, and she kind of lost out on that. But to finish fourth against three very, very talented girls, I’m very proud of her.”
Despite Strausa’s performance, which re-
sulted in first-team All-SEC accolades, the rest of the Gators could not keep up with the com-petition. Florida finished fourth — its worst showing in the SEC Championships since 2007. 
“We went in really confident and really 
strong,” Strausa said. “We tried to stick with the front pack, but it went out pretty fast — faster than expected.”
Strausa was the only Flor-
ida runner to crack the top 15 at the meet.  Cory McGee, who was the second Gator to cross the finish line, finished in 16th place with a time of 21:01.16.
“We just need to be tough-
er,” Strausa said. “We just 
need to approach the next 
race as if we have never lost before, race like champions and leave this behind on the golf course.”
As the race came down to the final lap, 
Strausa said she realized she was about to finish her last home cross country race as a Gator and used that as motivation.
But Strausa said the team has a differ-
ent source of motivation as it prepares for the NCAA Regional Championship, one that came from watching Arkansas chant “pig sooie” on their home course after sweeping the individ-ual awards.
“It makes us hungry,” she said. “It makes us 
want to be better. It makes us more angry than it hurts. It’s great training fuel.”Strausa shines at SEC meet

Kelvin Taylor (21) makes a cut while running the ball during Florida’s 23-20 loss to Georgia on Saturday at EverBank Field in Jacksonville. Taylor, a freshman run -
ning back who is the son of former Gators tailback Fred Taylor, carried the ball 20 times for 76 yards while making the first start of his career.a 5-yard touchdown to give 
the Bulldogs a lead fewer than three minutes into the game.
As it turned out, he was just 
getting started.
After a missed field goal 
by the Gators on their opening drive, the Bulldogs started their second possession from the UGA 23-yard line. Following an incompletion and a 4-yard rush, Georgia faced third and 6.
That’s when Gurley came 
through again.
With Florida (4-4, 3-3 South-
eastern Conference) blitzing, Murray checked down over the middle to his tailback, who suddenly found himself in open space. He sprinted past safety Cody Riggs and outran cornerback Marcus Roberson to go 73 yards for his second touchdown a little more than five minutes into the game.
“He helped a little bit, didn’t 
he?” Richt joked. “He played so well those first couple of se-ries.”
Antonio Morrison was re-
sponsible for covering Gurley on his receiving touchdown but was caught too close to the line and was unable to recover in time to prevent a completion or make a tackle in the open field.
“We got what we wanted and we missed it,” coach Will Muschamp said.
Uncharacteristic mistakes 
plagued Florida’s defense dur-ing the game — especially in the first half.
Georgia (5-3, 4-2 SEC) to-
taled 335 yards of offense prior to halftime — more yards than the Gators have allowed in six games this season.
“We’ve certainly been in-
consistent,” Muschamp said. “That’s the frustrating part for me right now.”
Florida’s defense stabilized 
after halftime — Georgia gained only 79 yards in the second half — before a deflating final drive ended the game and likely any chance the Gators had of earn-ing a trip to the SEC Champion-ship Game.
After Florida’s offense 
scored 17 consecutive points to pull within 23-20, Georgia gained possession with 8:17 re-maining in the fourth quarter.
The Bulldogs never gave 
back the football.
Gurley, who returned after 
being treated for exhaustion in the first half, picked up a pair of third-down conversions as Georgia ran 16 plays to kill the clock. The sophomore tailback finished the game with 100 rushing yards on 17 carries and added 87 receiving yards on three catches.
“It was so good to have him 
back,” Richt said.back,” Brown said. “Our parents taught us better. Our coaches taught us better. We’re not going to quit. We’re going to fight to the last game of the season.”
Florida eventually showed some 
bite. Muschamp tried explaining what happened in the first quarter, where the Gators surrendered 259 total yards to the Bulldogs. It sound-ed like coach jargon. 
A better explanation is they just 
sucked. Florida fans have a right to be upset. It gets tiring watch-ing a struggling defense and a bad Big Ten offense in the Southeastern Conference every week.
To the guy in the orange shirt: 
You got your money’s worth on Sat-urday. That was a hell of a second half by a Gators team that got em-barrassed through two quarters. To University of Florida students: Be happy you’re attending a big-time SEC school where football week-ends are the best weekends.
Sure, this coaching regime is 22-
12 and 4-5 versus Georgia, Florida State, Miami and Tennessee, which are four teams Meyer went 17-2 against. 
Yet, Muschamp walked into the 
interview room at EverBank Field stern and disappointed with his family among the media despite the cameras that flashed, the questions that were asked, and the coach that stood at perhaps his lowest profes-sional point in three years. 
That’s what you do. Sometimes 
family doesn’t fulfill expectations, but one thing remains. Family sticks together.against Bulldogs linebackers Amarlo Her-
rera and Jordan Jenkins, as well as Florida linemen Trenton Brown and Jon Harrison.
Penalties cost the Gators again in the 
fourth quarter.
Georgia attempted to run the ball for 
a first down on a fourth-and-1 play that Florida stopped. After the play, linebacker Neiron Ball took off his helmet, resulting in a personal foul that pushed the Gators back 15 yards before their drive even start-ed. It ended in a punt.
“That’s all a judgment call,” Muschamp 
said. 
UF accumulated 13 penalties through-
out the game, including five unsportsman-like conduct penalties and two personal fouls.
Despite all the penalties earlier in the 
game, the last one broke Florida’s back. 
Before the game was over, the Bulldogs 
and Gators would be flagged for four more offsetting unsportsmanlike conduct penal-ties.
“It’s hard to see some of that, so what-
ever they call, they call,” Muschamp said.
Offensive line protects: After giving 
up 10 sacks in its previous two games, Florida’s offensive line got off to a strong start in Jacksonville. The unit surrendered only one sack during the first half against Georgia but four overall.
“They stepped up today,” Murphy said. “They took it upon themselves to do better. So they did a good job and gave me a lot of time in the pocket.”Muschamp shuffled the offensive line 
during practice leading up to the game due to injury and poor performance.
Redshirt sophomore Tyler Moore shift-
ed from right tackle to left tackle due to sophomore D.J. Humphries (knee) suffer-ing an injury during practice. 
Brown took over for Moore at right 
tackle. Muschamp said he expects to leave the line the way it is for the foreseeable fu-ture.
“I thought we blocked well,” he said. “I 
thought we got a hat on a hat.”
Kickers struggle: The Gators attempted 
three field goals against the Bulldogs on Saturday but made only one.
Velez, playing in only his third career 
game, missed one of his two tries. The red-shirt junior missed a 40-yard attempt in the first quarter and made a 31-yard kick in second to put the Gators on the board.
Austin Hardin, UF’s designated “long 
kicker” missed a 47-yard field goal.
“We need to get points out of the drive,” 
Muschamp said. “We just got to convert those situations.”
Florida has had a rough time replacing 
former kicker Caleb Sturgis, who made 24 of 28 field goals last season. Sturgis cur-rently plays for the Miami Dolphins.
The Gators are a combined 9 of 15 on 
field goals this season.

Landon Watnick / Alligator StaffGeorgia scored game-winning points on ﬁ  eld goal prior to halftime
would have kicked,” Muschamp 
said. “I felt we had to call the game aggressively.”
Then, Florida began to capital-
ize on opportunities.
Leon Orr picked up a dropped 
lateral that Georgia’s Arthur Lynch believed was an incomplete pass. The play set up a Mack Brown touchdown run.
Later in the third, punter Johnny 
Townsend pinned the Bulldogs at their own 3-yard line. On the next play, Loucheiz Purifoy sacked Mur-ray in the end zone for a safety.
Florida rode the momentum of 
its third quarter turnaround to an early fourth-quarter touchdown courtesy of Murphy’s legs. The redshirt junior quarterback tallied 39 yards on back-to-back carries, the second of which was a 14-yard touchdown scamper.
One successful two-point con-
version later, the dream was re-vived. Atlanta was back on the map.
“We just went out there and had 
a different mindset,” linebacker Neiron Ball said. “I mean, we went out there with a mindset to win.”
Once the deﬁ  cit was trimmed to 
three, the Gators seemed primed to complete their comeback as the de-fense stepped up with yet another big play. The Bulldogs tried to con-vert a fourth and one from their own 39, but UF stuffed Gurley at the line.
The Gators did not want Gurley 
to run them out of SEC title conten-tion. Not again.
Following his strong ﬁ  rst half, 
Gurley managed only 36 yards on his ﬁ  nal 13 carries.
“We knew that he was their 
main weapon,” Florida linebacker Michael Taylor said. “We knew they were going to go to him, so we keyed in on him.”
But the Gators went backwards 
after their critical fourth-down stop, punting to the Bulldogs with 8:17 remaining in regulation. Flori-da did not get the ball back.Georgia converted three third 
downs on a 15-play, 67-yard drive. The Gators stuffed Gurley on a fourth third down, but Darious Cummings was ﬂ  agged for hands to the face on the play, resulting in a game-clinching ﬁ  rst down for the Bulldogs.
With the game on the line, Flor-
ida’s mistakes became too much to overcome.
Every penalty ﬂ  ag, big play sur-
rendered, missed ﬁ  eld goal and stalled offensive drive stood in the way of Atlanta. Once again, the Gators’ goal is out of reach.
But Atlanta is not the only thing 
that eludes Florida. Muschamp’s plan has gone awry.Injuries have played a part in 
the slide, but opponents have out-muscled and outplayed last year’s “Florida Never Breaks” Gators.
Florida also failed to keep its 
cool. In addition to playing a mis-take-ﬁ  lled game, the Gators jawed with the Bulldogs and exchanged shoves after plays.
Muschamp even lost his compo-
sure, engaging in a brief verbal spat with a heckler in the stands follow-ing the game.
Florida did not only lose sight of 
its goals on Saturday night. Faced with adversity, the Gators lost sight of themselves.
“It’s pretty tough,” Trey Burton 
said. “Deﬁ  nitely, deﬁ  nitely tough.”
