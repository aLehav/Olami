POLICE SAY SHE 
PREVIOUSL Y TRIED TO 
CARRY OUT THE MURDER
By Samia Lagmis
Alligator Staff Writer
A Gainesville woman was arrest-
ed Friday after police say she tried 
to arrange a murder, which she pre-
viously tried to execute herself.
The Gainesville Police Depart-
ment arrested 29-year-old Victoria Leigh Sargento-Graham on charges 
of attempted murder and attempted 
solicitation, according to the arrest 
report.
Though the identity and relation-
ship of the victim are redacted in the 
report, an unnamed law enforce-
ment ofﬁ  cial identiﬁ  ed the victim 
as Sargento-Graham’s young son, 
as ﬁ  rst reported by The Gainesville 
Sun. 
Sargento-Graham called the wit-
ness at around 3:30 a.m. and asked 
him to come to her home. Once he arrived, Sargento-Graham asked 
him to kill for her, according to the 
report. 
Sargento-Graham informed the 
witness of her plan to have him suf-
focate the victim later in the day, 
the report stated. The witness said 
he pretended to agree to this plot 
and contacted authorities upon 
leaving her home. 
The next morning, the witness 
received another call from Sargen-
to-Graham, the report stated. Their 
conversation was audio and video recorded on the body camera of a 
present law enforcement ofﬁ  cer. 
During the phone call, Sargen-
to-Graham described a scenario in 
which her son would shoot himself 
with the witness’ gun, but decided 
against it out of fear that the witness 
would be arrested.
According to the report, Sargen-
to-Graham described the world as 
being cruel and said suffocating the 
victim while he’s asleep would be 
the best option. 
Once arrested and informed of her rights, Sar-
gento-Graham 
claimed the wit-
ness was the mas-
termind behind 
the plot to suf-
focate the victim. 
She later admitted 
that the plan was 
hers.
Sargento-Graham’s bond is set 
at $500,000.

LOSE FEDERAL FUNDING

Judaism will now be consid-
ered a nationality in the U.S. after 
President Donald Trump took ac-
tion against rising anti-Semitism 
and anti-Semitic incidents at col-
leges and universities.
He signed an executive order 
Dec. 11 intended to combat anti-
Semitism on college campuses, the 
New York Times reported. The or-
der gives the government author-
ity to withhold federal funding 
from institutions it deems biased 
or failing to combat anti-Semitic 
discrimination, administration of-
ﬁ  cials told The New York Times.
The order designates anti-Se-
mitic discrimination in colleges 
and universities “a form of bias 
against their shared national iden-tity — Israel — rather than just a 
form of religious discrimination.” 
This ofﬁ  cially considers Judaism a 
religion and a nationality, protect-
ing it under Title VI of the Civil 
Rights Act of 1964, The Times and 
Wall Street Journal reported. Title 
VI bans discrimination based on 
race, color or nationality at insti-
tutions receiving money from the 
government.
“The university is committed 
to protecting the First Amend-
ment rights of our students, fac-
ulty and staff while also following 
the requirements of the executive 
order,” UF spokesperson Steve Or-
lando wrote in a statement.
Orlando declined to comment 
further when asked about the uni-
versity’s plans to follow the order 
and if the university is concerned 
about losing funding in light of re-
cent campus events. 
THE STRIKE PROMPTED 
ANTI-WAR PROTESTS
By Hannah Phillips
Alligator Staff Writer
An American airstrike killed one 
of Iran’s top military leaders, Gen. 
Qassem Soleimani, on Friday. The 
strike followed a week of rapid-ﬁ  re 
attacks and counterstrikes between 
the U.S. and Iranian governments 
and has left the fate of the nations 
in question. Iran promised to retali-
ate. 
In response, about 50 Alachua 
County residents advocated for peace at the intersection of North-
west 16th Boulevard and Northwest 
43rd Street on Saturday afternoon. 
Members of the local Veterans for 
Peace chapter held signs denounc-
ing the war and encouraging on-
lookers to vote in upcoming elec-
tions. Some drivers honked their 
support while others jeered at the 
demonstrators. This echoed similar 
protests throughout the country. 
Paul Ortiz, a 55-year-old UF his-
tory professor and member of Vet-
erans for Peace, said he believes 
Soleimani’s assassination has uni-
ﬁ  ed people in Iran against the U.S. 
government. 
Ortiz is a third-generation vet-eran. He said the leaders who or-
chestrate war do so without con-
sequence, and while they can talk 
about war, they are not the ones 
who have to ﬁ  ght it. 
“It’s my family and other work-
ing-class families who do,” he said. 
“We’re the people who have to 
ﬁ  ght in the war.” 
U.S. Speaker of the House of 
Representatives Nancy Pelosi wrote 
in a press release that Trump had 
carried out the strike without au-
thorization from Congress. 
Matthew Barocas, a 20-year-old 
UF political science junior and the 
UF College Democrats president, 
said this sets a bad precedent for partisanship with national security. 
Barocas said he is glad Soleimani 
is dead, but he fears the backlash 
that will follow and that foreign al-
lies will view the U.S. as an irratio-
nal actor. Overseas diplomats may 
fall victim to a retaliatory attack by 
Iran, he said.
“I’m not sure what we can do 
besides hunker down,” he said. 
Jarrod Rodriguez, a 20-year-
old UF political science junior and 
UF College Republicans treasurer, 
thinks differently. Swift, decisive 
action is how adversaries should be 
dealt with, he said. 
He said the strike sends a mes-
sage: Trump is not going to take at-tacks sitting down.
“Iran wouldn’t dare to declare 
war on us,” he said. “We would 
easily destroy them.”
Farad Packdel, a 42-year-old UF 
alumnus, has children in America 
and parents in Iran. He said he 
hopes politicians will de-escalate 
the situation for the sake of Ameri-
can and Iranian citizens. 
“Send your daughters to war if 
you really believe in this,” Packdel 
said. “Not ours.”

PLACE IN JUNE

It started with a text and ended 
with a bang. 
Alachua County Sheriff’s Of-
fice deputies arrested 26-year-old 
Gainesville resident Sarah Elizabeth 
Harris Friday in connection with a 
robbery and shooting that took place 
on June 25. 
Thaddeus M. Surrency, 44, of 
Gainesville, and Raynyoda S. Jackson, 
41, of High Springs, were previously 
arrested for the same June offense.
Harris was texting her friend, 
34-year-old Cecil Eugene Boykin Jr. 
of Gainesville, who sent her photos 
of money and asked to meet Harris in 
a hotel room to “make love and chill 
with her,” according to an arrest re-
port.
At the time, Harris was with both 
Jackson and Surrency at Jackson’s 
home. The three plotted to lure Boykin 
to an Alachua Waffle House, located 
at 15979 NW US Highway 441, under 
the guise that he was meeting only Harris, according to 
the report. 
Once at the 
restaurant, Harris 
entered Boykin’s 
vehicle, and they 
drove to the robbery 
location. Police said 
Jackson and Sur-
rency followed suit.
Boykin was then robbed and shot.
According to the arrest report, Sur-
rency told Boykin to “give me the rest 
of your money, Sarah said you had a 
lot.”
Police identified Surrency as the 
shooter, despite his claims that it was 
Jackson.
Following the robbery, Boykin 
crashed his car into trees, and Jack-
son fled. Police later found Boykin at a 
nearby convenience store. He suffered 
multiple gunshot wounds.
Harris was charged with attempted 
murder, robbery with a firearm, con-
spiracy to commit robbery and viola-
tion of probation. Her bond is set at 
$400,000.

HE IS THE SECOND 
IN THE UNIVERSITY’S 
HISTORY TO 
BE SELECTED
By Emma McAvoy
Alligator Staff Writer
In high school, Aaron Sandoval 
became obsessed with Deadpool, 
Marvel’s comic character who has 
accelerated healing and regenera-
tive powers.  
Sandoval has turned in his 
superhero cape for a lab coat by 
working with reparative methods 
for the human body. And now, 
he’s received a national award that 
will allow him to do that. 
Sandoval, a 21-year-old UF bi-
ology senior, was selected for the 
Marshall Scholarship, which gives 
students in the U.S. a chance to 
pursue their graduate studies in 
the United Kingdom, all expenses 
paid. He is the second Marshall 
Scholar in UF’s history, following 
Steven Robinette in 2009. 
Sandoval was one of 46 stu-
dents chosen out of more than 
1,000 applicants across the U.S.   The Marshall Scholarship Pro-
gram was created in 1953 to thank 
the U.S. for helping the U.K. after 
World War II under the Marshall 
Plan, which was the U.S.’s way of 
helping European economies after 
the devastation of the war, accord-
ing to the program’s website. 
“It still hasn’t really sunk in 
yet,” Sandoval said. “I’m happy to 
have won it.”  
Sandoval said in his two years 
at the University of Cambridge and 
King’s College London he’ll study 
biochemistry and focus on the 
transfer of stem cells from the lab 
to the patients so they can under-
stand what cells are being used to 
help them. 
Sandoval has collaborated with 
UF faculty members like Malcolm 
Maden, a professor in UF’s Cancer 
and Genetics Research Institute. 
Sandoval and Maden worked in a 
lab with an African spiny mouse, 
to figure out how stem cells repair 
parts of the human body like skin 
tissue.    
In 2012, Maden and his re-
search team discovered the Afri-
can spiny mouse’s ability to regen-
erate skin scar free. Maden wrote one of Sandoval’s letters of recom-
mendation for his application for 
the scholarship. 
Sandoval said if the mouse’s 
regeneration of skin cells could be 
translated to humans, then a hu-
man’s wounds could completely 
heal rather than scar.
Sandoval didn’t have the op-
portunity to do research in high 
school and wanted to learn more 
at the university level, so he de-
cided to take Maden’s lab.
Maden said Sandoval’s unique-
ness stems from his intelligence, 
drive and ability to interact with 
different kinds of people. 
“He’s behaved like a dynamic 
scientist, not like an undergrad,” 
he said. “Completely amazing, to-
tally unique guy.” 
Sandoval said he feels fortu-
nate to have won the award and to 
have so many people who helped 
him get to this point. 
“I couldn’t have done it with-
out the support of family, friends, 
mentors,” he said. “It took a whole 
village to win this thing.”

75 MPH WINDS DAMAGE 
THE NORTH SHORE AND 
DELAY REOPENING
By Allessandra Inzinna
Alligator Staff Writer
Lake Wauburg’s building struc-
tures, docks and watercraft equip-ment  took a hit from strong winds 
during winter break. Despite that, 
though, it is reopening to the public. 
UF RecSports announced Friday 
on Facebook that while the south 
shore will reopen Tuesday, the north 
shore will remain closed for repairs.
The damage occurred in the 
early morning of Dec. 14 because of 
75 mph winds. Whether a tornado 
caused it is unconfirmed, though high winds damaged the area, said 
Aaron Hobson, director of opera-
tions for RecSports.
The harsh weather affected solely 
the north shore, where boat shelters 
and trees in the area were impaired. 
There is no confirmed date to reopen 
the north shore, though activities 
may resume in the next week or two, 
Hobson said.             
“We’ve got a number of contrac-tors,” Hobson said. “Facility services 
has been helping us significantly 
with tree removal and debris remov-
al. That’s probably our number one 
concern.”
Twenty-one-year-old theatre se-
nior Nicole Mooradian has visited 
Lake Wauburg multiple times to kay-
ak and unwind throughout her time 
at UF.
“I was really surprised and sad-dened to hear about [the damage to 
the lake],” Mooradian wrote over 
direct message. “I had no idea there 
had even been a storm. The pictures 
that I saw were really sad to see.”

UF researchers may have 
found a cure for some can-
cers.
Researchers from the UF 
College of Pharmacy say they 
have found a potential drug 
to treat some types of leuke-
mia, lymphoma and breast 
and lung cancers. The results 
were published in Nature 
Medicine last month. 
The potential drug is a 
compound called DT2216 
and acts on a protein that in-
creases cancerous cells and 
resists treatment, said Dao-
hong Zhou, a professor in the 
UF College of Pharmacy.  
According to a report by 
UF Health, an inhibitor to 
stop the protein’s growth al-
ready exists, but it is not ap-
proved by the Food and Drug 
Administration because it 
puts people at risk of bleed-
ing and is harmful.
Zhou collaborated with 
Guangrong Zheng, a profes-
sor in the UF College of Phar-
macy, in this study.
The study began over a year and a half ago. Zhou and 
Zheng strategized to develop 
DT2216 through a technol-
ogy that degrades and breaks 
down cancer-promoting pro-
teins. The goal was to effec-
tively and safely treat a vari-
ety of cancers, which takes a 
lot of testing and review be-
fore being brought out to the 
public.
“By inducing protein 
degradation, we can poten-
tially heal those cancer cells,” 
Zhou said. 
To test their hypothesis, 
researchers used mathemati-
cal and mouse models. For 
example, human tumor cells 
were implanted into mice so 
they could grow cancerous 
tumors, Zhou said. DT2216 
was then tested and found 
successful.
Results show the com-
pound was stronger on a 
variety of tumor cells, but 
was less harmful to plate-
lets, Zhou said. This makes 
DT2216 significant because 
it is not as harmful as other 
solutions, according to Zhou.
DT2216 is technically 
not considered a drug yet, because the FDA has not 
approved it for public use, 
Zheng said. The drug discov-
ery process takes typically 
more than 10 years to prog-
ress from the lab to a patient. 
“It’s a long process,” 
Zheng said. “We’ve basically 
finished the first period of 
discovery.” 
The study is being led 
by a multidisciplinary team 
composed of UF, Columbia 
University, the University of 
Texas at San Antonio, Chil-
dren’s Hospital Los Angeles 
and the University of Texas 
MD Anderson Cancer Center, 
Zhou said. 
After about two to five 
years of human testing, the 
FDA will decide if the drug is 
safe and effective enough to 
use clinically, Zheng said. 
“It’s hard to predict [the 
outcome],” Zheng said. 
“Hopefully we are able to 
reach that final stage.”

mlyden@alligator.org UF SETS GOALS TO BECOME A 
TOP FIVE SCHOOL
By Ana Escalante
Alligator Staff Writer
UF’s Board of Trustees, the school’s govern-
ing body, met on Dec. 5 and Dec. 6 to discuss 
the current state of the university. The 13 mem-
bers meet once every semester to decide policy 
and act as the university’s governing body. 
The board approved new projects and pro-
posals, as well as named several construction 
projects. The majority of progress made is to 
reach a top five public university according to 
U.S. News & World Report.
New parking garage finishes final stages
The new commuter parking lot, located on 
Gale Lemerand Drive, will hold approximately 
2,000 spots, UF spokesperson Steve Orlando 
said. The garage cost approximately $31.7 mil-
lion, according to the trustee’s website. It has 
not been named yet.
This comes after decals increased by $18 
in March for faculty and non-students to fund 
the project, according to Alligator archives. The 
lot is set to be completed in February, Orlando 
said.
Construction projects begin
Several construction projects were renamed 
during the two-day meeting. UF’s new baseball 
field’s bullpen will be named after former Ja-
son Beaird, former UF baseball player, Orlando 
said. 
The $65 million project is set to be com-pleted in June, according to Alligator archives.
The new athletic training center will be 
named after James Heavener, current board of 
trustees member. You may have seen his name 
on Heavener Hall, hub for the Warrington Col-
lege of Business. 
“He has supported our football program for 
many years,” Scott Stricklin, UF Athletic Direc-
tor, said at the meeting. “He’s about as positive 
as any Gator can be.” 
Construction for the $85 million 
140,000-square-foot football training complex 
is currently estimated to start in late July, with 
a completion goal of December 2021. 
The O’Connell Center’s basketball court 
will be renamed after Billy Donovan, former 
UF basketball coach, Orlando said. The formal 
naming ceremony will take place Feb. 15, dur-
ing UF’s game against Vanderbilt.
Student-to-teacher ratios decreased
The university was at a projected rate of 18 
students to three faculty at the end of the Fall 
2019 semester, Morteza Hosseini, board chair-
man, said at the meeting. He said that because 
U.S. News & World Report rounds down, it will 
be reflected as a 18:1 ratio. UF Spokesperson 
Steve Orlando was able to confirm this. 
UF’s student to faculty ratio was previously 
21:1 in Fall 2017, Orlando said. A net increase 
of 415 faculty since then accounts for the low-
ering of the ratio. 
“The goal of this board is to make top five,” 
Hosseini said at the meeting. “But to also main-
tain [our status].”

A group of UF students 
protested an Israel Defense 
Forces speaker at Little Hall 
in support of Palestine in 
November. The incident 
spurred debates on campus 
about the Israeli-Palestinian 
conﬂ  ict and a disagreement 
between students and UF ad-
ministration on if protesters 
called the IDF soldier offen-
sive terms.
UF Jewish fraternity Zeta 
Beta Tau member Daniel Far-
ji, 21, said Trump’s executive 
order is important to combat 
rising anti-Semitism, espe-
cially with the prevalence of 
the Boycott, Divestment and 
Sanctions movement — a Palestinian-led movement to 
boycott Israel — on college 
campuses. 
“Anti-Israel sentiment is 
ﬁ  ne as long as it’s criticizing 
the government of Israel,” 
Farji said. “But unfortunate-
ly, a lot of BDS protests or 
organizations do become an-
ti-Semitic because they use 
racial slurs against Jews.” 
Clay Calvert, the director 
of the Marion B. Brechner 
First Amendment Project 
at UF, said anti-Semitism is 
an escalating issue. But he 
thinks the executive order is 
ﬂ  awed.
Hate speech, including 
the state department’s deﬁ  ni-tion of anti-Semitic speech, 
is protected under the First 
Amendment as long as it 
doesn’t contain true threats 
of violence or is likely to in-
cite violence, Calvert said. 
But he said the executive or-
der’s language is too ambigu-
ous and could endanger this 
free speech.
It is unclear how to de-
termine if a university is 
adequately combatting anti-
Semitism, he said. He added 
that most public universities 
are already against discrimi-
nation of any kind. 
“It’s almost like an execu-
tive order overkill,” he said.

SHE’S ACCUSED OF 
STRIKING THE VICTIM 
ON HIS TEMPLE
By Samia Lagmis
Alligator Staff Writer
A UF employee was ar-
rested Thursday after police 
responded to claims she struck 
a victim with whom she lives 
with.
The Alachua County Sher-
iff’s Ofﬁ  ce deputies arrested 
28-year-old Lavarsha Takisha 
Nattiel for domestic battery, 
according to the arrest report.
Nattiel works at the UF 
Building Services Department 
and has been employed there for ﬁ  ve months, according to 
court records. She and the vic-
tim live together and have a 
2-year-old child. 
According to the arrest re-
port, Nattiel and the victim 
were arguing at home where 
she began to call him names. 
Nattiel is accused of then in-
tentionally striking him on 
his temple, causing a swollen 
lump to form. 
The victim then left and 
contacted law enforcement, 
the report read. 
Nattiel had minor red mark-
ings on her right hand and 
stated that she is right-handed, 
according to the arrest report. 
Authorities found these mark-
ings to be consistent with the victim’s  
statements 
and arrested 
Nattiel for 
domestic  
battery.
A no-
contact or-
der has been 
issued as a 
condition of pretrial release. 
Nattiel is prohibited to have 
any direct or indirect contact 
with the victim and must live 
in an alternate residence.
UF spokesperson Steve Or-
lando declined to comment on 
the arrest as of Sunday eve-
ning.
slagmis@alligator.orgA NEW PARTY AND 
CONTINUING 
PRESIDENTIAL 
IMPEACHMENT
By Chasity Maynard
Alligator Staff Writer
The semester is start-
ing and so is UF Student 
Government. Here is a 
what happened this Fall 
and what to expect in 
Spring.
SG funding
Following the lawsuit 
from the Young Ameri-
cans for Freedom in the 
Summer, SG reallocated 
funding for the “Big 
Nine” student organi-
zations, including the 
Hispanic Student Asso-
ciation, Black Student 
Union and Asian Ameri-
can Student Union, caus-
ing groups to fundraise 
and hold welcome events 
in smaller venues.
Gator Party emerged
Senate President Em-
ily Dunson announced 
the new political party, 
Gator Party, and it cam-
paigned as a new biparti-
san student organization. 
An Alligator investiga-
tion questioned Gator’s 
leadership roles when 
paperwork from Summer 
revealed inconsistencies 
about who ofﬁ  cially was 
president and treasurer. 
Blue lights on 
Fraternity Row
After failed attempts to legislatively bring blue 
lights — non-dial phones 
that contact emergency 
assistance — on Frater-
nity Row, frustrated stu-
dents marched down the 
drive Sept. 17 in protest. 
University Police then 
responded with plans to 
install four blue lights on 
the row.
Inspire Party high-
lighted blue lights in 
their campaign.
Election and 
legislation
Inspire Party won the 
majority of Senate seats 
for the ﬁ  rst time in his-
tory over Gator Party 
Sept. 25. However, the 
new senators were not 
conﬁ  rmed until Oct. 15 
after Gator Party ﬁ  led a 
complaint that Inspire’s 
win was invalid and then 
attendance at a meeting 
stalled the conﬁ  rmations.
Impeachment
Hundreds of students 
protested outside a paid 
Accent Speakers Bureau 
speech Oct. 10 featuring 
Donald Trump Jr. and 
Kimberly Guilfoile. They 
were paid $50,000 to 
speak at UF in the Fall. 
The Alligator reported 
that protestors didn’t 
want their student fees 
used for the speech. 
Student Body Presi-
dent Michael Murphy 
drew national attention 
and accusations of abuse 
of power after an Alliga-
tor investigation found 
he corresponded with a Trump campaign ofﬁ  cial 
about bringing Trump Jr. 
to campus. Inspire sena-
tors drafted a bill to im-
peach Murphy. 
After multiple meet-
ing cancellations and no 
impeachment hearing, 
the resolution to impeach 
Murphy was deemed il-
legitimate at a judiciary 
committee meeting Nov. 
21. 
New party announced 
at last Senate meeting
Fall independent can-
didate Alfredo Ortiz an-
nounced Dec. 3 that stu-
dents plan to start a third 
political party called the 
Progressive Party.
Spring plans
Inspire leader Ben 
Lima said the party will 
continue to pursue im-
peachment for Murphy 
and seek reparations 
from Dunson because 
she did not schedule an 
impeachment hearing.
The party aims to 
merge sexual assault re-
sources to make them 
more streamlined for 
students, improve coun-
seling accessibility at the 
Counseling & Wellness 
Center and establish on-
line voting for SG elec-
tions. 
Gator leader Gabbi 
Hernandez and Murphy 
did not respond to re-
quests for comment.

Letter to the Editor
Be heard through elections
ColumnColumn
On Friday, it was revealed Gen. Qassem 
Soleimani was killed in a drone strike 
ordered by President Trump. Because of 
this, the U.S. is lurching toward a dan-
gerous situation in Iran.
First, let’s back up. Qassem Soleimani was 
a top Iranian general. Ofﬁ  cially, he is the com-
mander of Iran’s Quds Force, which is the coun-
try’s military arm for special operations and 
military affairs outside of Iran. In practice, this 
position has made Soleimani one of the most 
important ofﬁ  cials in Iran and the chief ofﬁ  cial 
responsible for relations with Iraq. 
This is because Iraq has been on the receiving end of sig-
niﬁ  cant Iranian inﬂ  uence, primarily through Iraqi militias 
that are backed by Iran. These militias, the Popular Mobi-
lization Forces, are nominally under the same rules as the 
Iraqi military and answerable to the prime minister of Iraq, 
but in practice, they took their orders from Soleimani and 
ofﬁ  cials in Iran. These militias achieved greater prominence 
last month after the U.S. launched airstrikes against facili-
ties associated with these militias in Iraq. Shortly afterward, 
the PMF militias and their supporters broke into the U.S. 
embassy in Baghdad. The U.S. accused Iran of ordering the 
embassy attack, which Iran denies, and it was this incident 
and other attacks against U.S. forces (including one where 
a U.S. contractor was killed) that the Trump Administration 
has used to justify the assassination of Soleimani.
To be clear, I am not defending Soleimani. He was a le-
gitimate threat to U.S. forces in the Middle East. At the same 
time, I am worried about the consequences of this killing. So-
leimani and his Quds Force were designated by the U.S. as a 
terrorist organization, but unlike something like al-Qaida, the 
Quds Force has ofﬁ  cial government backing, and its leader is 
a top ofﬁ  cial in that government. To Iran, this isn’t the killing 
of a rogue terrorist, but the assassination of a top military and political ofﬁ  cial. Iran won’t take this lying down. 
After news of the attack broke, World War III 
and related hashtags trended on Twitter along 
with memes and jokes about Americans being 
drafted to ﬁ  ght in Iran. However, this is unlikely 
to happen. The last time citizens were drafted 
was the Vietnam War in the 1960s and ’70s, and 
previous American interventions in the Middle 
East have not resulted in drafting, so there’s no 
reason to suspect Iran will be any different. And 
that’s assuming there will be a conventional war 
in Iran. 
While the Trump administration has been 
home to warlike voices like John Bolton (who recently re-
signed as National Security Adviser) and Mike Pompeo (who 
is still Secretary of State), the administration likely also real-
izes that a direct war would be unpopular and costly, just 
as Iran likely realizes that facing the U.S. Army openly will 
be less effective than unconventional tactics. However, the 
resulting conﬂ  ict could still be deadly, as Iran launches re-
prisal attacks on U.S. bases that could harm the servicemen 
within. To Iran, Americans will effectively have a target on 
their backs if they are in Iran or Iraq.
Ultimately, this is a delicate situation that requires quiet 
and thoughtful actions, not reckless strikes on important gov-
ernment ofﬁ  cials. Thankfully, legislation is in Congress mak-
ing just that point. Senator Tim Kaine introduced a bill on Fri-
day which would require Congress to approve any war with 
Iran. With any luck, the bill will gain traction in Congress, 
and the president will take the hint and slow U.S. hostility in 
Iraq. Once that is done, we should let Iraq take the lead, and 
use both incentives and threats to get Iraq to crack down on 
its Iranian militias. While it likely won’t achieve peace in the 
Middle East, it will at least leave Americans safer.
Jason Zappulla is a UF history senior.I really hope someone in SG got a nice cam-
era for Christmas, because it sure seems 
like they need one.
I was going through emails from the 
executive branch in August when I saw 
an interesting email from deputy chief of 
staff Branden Pearson. He was asking one of 
the professional staff members if it was pos-
sible for her to utilize her interns to make 
a platform tracker video to be published the 
ﬁ  rst week of September to promote mobile 
ticketing for football games.
For those unaware, SG used to publish frequent vid-
eos claiming to have accomplished things they prom-
ised to do during the campaign season. In this case, it 
seems that SG wanted to claim credit for the work the 
UF Athletic Association (UAA) did on mobile ticketing. 
The Alligator reported on mobile ticketing twice, and no 
one ever said that SG was involved in any sort of way. 
Perhaps they were tangentially involved, but likely 
this was yet another case of SG trying to co-opt the 
work of others for its own personal gain. SG folks al-
ways like to promise to do things that are already in 
progress by other entities to make up for their true in-
ability to make a difference on campus. It’s kind of an-
noying to be honest.
The professional staff wrote back to coordinate the 
video and one line, in particular, stood out to me: “SG 
does not have a camera to loan out.”
Wait, so our SG who has always been happy to spend 
thousands of dollars on commemorative coins doesn’t 
even have a camera? Is this why we repeatedly spend 
$190 on headshot sessions for top ofﬁ  cials?
The video Pearson wanted mysteriously never mate-
rialized. This past Fall semester, our Facebook page had posted a whopping total of two videos. One 
is a message from President Fuchs with high 
video quality that makes me believe it wasn’t 
shot by SG ofﬁ  cials. The other video chris-
tened as “our ﬁ  rst Monday in a Minute” has 
all the hallmarks of being shot by someone 
within SG: it’s low resolution, backlit, shaky 
and awfully color balanced (it’s very orange).
Still, I appreciated the effort as the video 
did provide viewers with updates on what SG 
was doing. Interestingly enough, the descrip-
tion of the video encourages viewers to “tune 
in every Monday to hear about what we have going 
on each week in SG.” There have been no subsequent 
“Monday(s) in a Minute” so I guess nothing has gone 
on since then in the three months since its publication.
The Spring 2019 semester wasn’t any better with 
only two videos posted then as well. One of the videos 
actually looks really well done which means that there 
is a one percent chance it was done by SG ofﬁ  cials and 
a 99 percent chance it was done by literally anyone else. 
In the span of an entire year, our Facebook page only 
posted four videos, down from nine the year before and 
10 in 2017. Somewhere in the bowels of the SG ofﬁ  ce, 
there’s supposed to be a whole agency of hapless fools 
banging pots and pans together in order to come up 
with social media content. It’s clear that they aren’t 
good at what they do. It’s clear they could use better 
equipment, too.
Someone please buy SG a camera and help them out. 
Do it for the kids.

other students can sympathize with my struggle to 
avoid arguments over politics at family gatherings. 
My experiences have led me to this: Imagine if only 
people who voted were allowed to start arguments 
over the holiday dinner table? 
It’s not uncommon to get stopped in Turlington Plaza to 
debate some political topic or another. College campuses 
are some of the most politically vocal places in the U.S. 
However, in my hypothetical example around the family 
dinner table, based on statistics from Tufts University’s In-
stitute for Democracy and Higher Education, less than half 
of all American college students would be able to voice 
these opinions if doing so was restricted to those who vote. 
According to the same study from the Institute for De-
mocracy and Higher Education, college students on average 
vote at a higher rate than the general American public, but 
even those numbers are still pitiful at best. 
Regardless of if its correct, my generation is often ac-
cused of not caring for anyone or anything but ourselves. 
Exercising your right to vote changes the foundation of that 
narrative. From the roads we drive on to the tuition stu-
dents and families pay, our lives are affected by elections 
and the choices we collectively make. 
No matter what party you support, your vote directly 
affects student lives and communities. The process can be 
daunting for ﬁ  rst-time voters — and I recognize that many 
students are ﬁ  rst-time voters — but I assure you that the 
Alachua County Supervisor of Elections Ofﬁ  ce is here to 
help us through the elections process.
Voting is easy once you have a few pieces of vital infor-
mation.
You must be registered to vote, and registered with the 
political party you intend to vote with for the primary, at 
least 29 days before an election. You can register to vote at 
RegisterToVoteFlorida.gov.  
There are three countywide elections in 2020: the Presi-
dential preference primary on March 17, the primary elec-
tion on Aug. 18 and the general election on Nov. 3.
A valid photo ID with a signature is required to vote. A 
list of acceptable identiﬁ  cation can be found at VoteAla-
chua.com. On Election Day, polls are open from 7 a.m. to 
7 p.m.
Don’t forget about early voting: For Alachua County vot-
ers during the presidential preference primary, early voting 
is open March 6 to March 14 from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. The Reitz 
Union, situated in the heart of campus, is one of six Alachua 
County early voting sites.
If you’re registered to vote in another county and would 
like to continue to vote there, consider requesting a mail-in 
ballot. Call your county’s elections ofﬁ  ce to request a ballot. 
I’d be remiss if I didn’t encourage you to consider going 
above and beyond your civic duty by working elections. 
It’s an easy way to make some money, and it gives you an 
up-close look at the elections process. More information is 
available at VoteAlachua.com. 
Don’t lose your voice at the polls or the dinner table: 
Come out and vote.

student at UF, interned with the Alachua County Supervisor

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
MEN'S BASKETBALLBy Graham Marsh
Sports Writer
Despite trailing by seven two 
times in the ﬁ  rst half, Florida’s 
women’s basketball team found 
itself up 40-34 at halftime 
against Vanderbilt on Sunday.
The Gators seized control 
midway through the second 
quarter, ﬁ  nding an outside 
stroke from guard Lavender 
Briggs that became a game-high 
19 points as UF went on to win 
68-60.
Florida needed this game 
to gather momentum while 
Vandy needed to continue it. The matchup came after a brutal 
93-47 loss to No. 15 Mississippi 
State in Starkville, Mississippi, 
for the Gators. It also followed 
a 77-55 Vanderbilt victory over 
Auburn.
Vanderbilt (11-4, 1-1 SEC) 
quickly ballooned the lead to 
seven with a little over seven 
minutes to play in the second 
quarter, largely behind the 
efforts of guard Chelsie Hall, 
who led her team in scoring in 
the ﬁ  rst half with nine. However,

Florida’s men’s basketball team 
somehow emerged from its game against 
Alabama on Saturday with a 104-98 win 
despite trailing by as much as 21. The 
Gators overcame a 14-point deﬁ  cit at the 
start of the second half to force overtime 
and eventually win in double overtime to 
complete the largest second-half come-
back in program history. Here are a couple of takeaways:
Offense rounding into form
UF’s offense has drawn the most criti-
cism for the team’s disappointing start to 
its campaign. It has seemingly alternated 
between decent and downright ugly for 
most of the season.
But the Gators have scored at least 80 
points in three of their last four games 
and 100 in back-to-back games. Against 
Providence, Long Beach State and Ala-bama, Florida shot above 43 percent in 
each game. A miserable offensive perfor-
mance against Utah State aside, this is the 
best the Gators have been offensively all 
season.
In its last 10 games, UF’s adjusted of-
fensive efﬁ  ciency ranks 31st in the coun-
try, according to Bart Torvik’s rankings.
Forwards Kerry Blackshear Jr. and 
Keyontae Johnson have scored 20 points 
or more at least once in the last four 
games, with Blackshear hitting that mark 
in three straight.Point guard Andrew Nembhard explod-
ed for a career-best 25 against Alabama 
and has dished out 28 helpers in that four-
game stretch. Guard Noah Locke has also 
had three double-digit scoring games.
Freshman Scottie Lewis has begun to 
make strides offensively. He was unable 
to play against LBSU because of a concus-
sion but has registered double-digit points 
in his last two games. Lewis also grabbed 
10 boards to complete a double-double 
against the Crimson Tide and had three Gators upset Vandy

FEATURE
By Payton Titus
Sports Writer
Whether you’re a sports fan or 
not, everyone recognizes the three 
Heisman statues poised in front of 
Ben Hill Griffin Stadium at UF.
Three men who left their mark 
on the Swamp. All around campus 
there are banners, plaques and 
framed pictures commemorating 
outstanding members of the Gator 
Nation for their athletic, academic 
and professional accomplishments. 
Every national and conference 
championship, every award-win-
ning individual enshrined for Gators 
past, present and future to look up 
to and take note of.
For those of us at the College of 
Journalism and Communications, 
Edward Aschoff was one of those 
people.
The ESPN college football re-
porter and UF alumnus passed away 
on Dec. 24 -- his 34th birthday -- 
from complications with pneumonia 
and HLH (a rare overactive immune 
disorder), according to ESPN and 
his fiancée, Katy Berteau.
Aschoff’s diligent reporting and 
thoughtful writing propelled him 
through the ranks of the sports 
media world. He started writing for 
the Gainesville Sun in 2007, gradu-
ated from the University of Florida 
College of Journalism and Commu-
nications in 2008 and joined ESPN 
in 2011.
As an Oxford, Mississippi, native 
and the son of a professor at the 
University of Mississippi, Aschoff 
had been surrounded by SEC foot-
ball since birth. He fell in love with 
journalism in college. Sportswriting 
allowed Aschoff to combine the 
two.
He began writing football 
features and recruiting updates for 
GatorBait magazine while at UF. 
What allowed him to achieve the 
rest was a whole lot of grit and 
determination.
While professionally he was a 
college football aficionado, Aschoff’s 
sporting interests expanded beyond 
that. He also followed the Carolina 
Panthers, Anaheim Ducks, Colorado 
Rockies, Atlanta United FC and 
the Toronto Raptors. His fandom 
crossed all boundaries, sporty and 
nerdy alike. He loved dinosaurs 
(hence his Raptors allegiance), the 
Simpsons and Godzilla.
“He really was a nerd, like, he 
really was,” said Mike McCall, 
former Alligator sports writer and 
classmate of Aschoff’s. “He had all 
sorts of things that he was into. He 
constantly would always surprise 
you with what interested him or 
what he was looking into.”
His obsession with Titanus gojira 
(better known as Godzilla) trans-
ported him from the television set 
to the big screen when he was cast 
as an extra in “Godzilla: King of the 
Monsters.” Aschoff’s fiancée even 
proposed to him with a Godzilla-
themed ring in Dec. 2018. The 
two were set to be married in New 
Orleans this April.
Aside from his quirky interests 
and eccentric sock collection (which 
included Raptors and Marvel Com-
ics themes), his star quality in the 
newsroom and in life made him stand out. As told by his peers, he 
was a master of his craft and a radi-
ant beam of light. His warmth was, 
and continues to be, felt across the 
sports media world.
ESPN crews, UF athletic direc-
tor Scott Stricklin and other media 
members at the Capital One Orange 
Bowl wore flower lapels in his 
memory. The internet has been set 
ablaze by kind words from As-
choff’s colleagues, carefully penning 
his legacy in powerful prose and 
telling tales of his kindness to be 
permanently archived in the Twit-
terverse.
While each person’s connection 
with Aschoff is unique, their senti-
ments are all very much the same: 
Edward Aschoff was a great person.
“One of the things since he 
passed that has been really amaz-
ing to see is anytime people post 
something about him on Twitter or 
you read an article about him, ev-
erybody says that he’s a ray of light, 
that he’s always positive,” McCall 
said. “The main thing… the main 
takeaway that I have as I reflect on 
the day-to-day stuff from when we 
were in college: It was just always 
great to see Ed. It was always great 
to have Ed around. It’s been pretty 
remarkable how consistent people 
have been, in saying that, and that 
really tells you something.”
While his eminence in journal-
ism took him far, Aschoff’s secret 
weapon -- that ultimately defines his 
legacy -- was his aptitude for forging 
impactful relationships. That is what 
made him a great reporter. That is 
what made him a great guy.
“I would say that the most 
extraordinary thing about Edward 
was that most students struggle 
very, very mightily with learning 
how to develop sources,” former UF 
adjunct professor Jason Cole recalls 
about having Aschoff in his class. 
“They’re scared of how to do it. 
They’re scared to approach people...
Ed was never scared. He was never 
frightened about getting to know 
people.”
Uniquely, Aschoff was univer-
sally well-liked and respected by his 
colleagues.
“You don’t hear a lot of other 
reporters, especially people that you 
compete with, who talked about 
what a wonderful human being you 
are,” Cole said. “They talked about 
‘Oh yeah, you’re a bulldog,’ or ‘a 
great reporter,’ or ‘you’re this,’ or 
‘you’re that.’ You know, the profes-
sional homage...They don’t dip into, 
‘Hey, what a good guy that was’ 
-- he was. And that’s the first and 
most profound thing that you see is 
what other reporters talked about 
when they talked about Edward.”
Aschoff’s networking skills cre-
ated long-lasting impacts on profes-
sors, fellow journalists as well as 
coaches and athletes alike.
“‘Keep on rocking,’ was, I think, 
the last thing I texted to him,” said 
Ted Spiker, professor and Journal-
ism Chair at UF.
The pair had been messag-
ing back and forth about a guest 
speaker appearance via Skype 
for Spiker’s fall Sports Media and 
Society class. Due to sudden travel 
changes involving his work, Aschoff 
had to cancel.“I would have loved for students 
to have gotten those 30 minutes 
with him,” Spiker said. “To see not 
only what he’s done, but to kind of 
feel his energy...That was just about 
a month before he died.”
According to Bruce Feldman, a 
reporter for The Athletic and friend 
of Aschoff, college football coaches 
reached out after his passing to 
express their sympathy.
ESPN’s Andrea Adelson said that 
one coach in particular stood out.
“Urban (Meyer) was the head 
coach at Florida when Edward 
was a student,” Adelson said. “He 
reached out to one of my colleagues 
to see what happened and to give 
his condolences, because he also re-
membered Edward as being nothing 
but a stand up guy who he enjoyed 
his interactions with.”
As a reporter, Aschoff’s charisma 
and welcoming persona made it 
easy for others to trust him with 
their stories. His feature on LSU run-
ning back Clyde Edwards-Helaire 
and his family serves as a perfect 
example. Edwards-Helaire’s mother, 
Tongelia Helaire, shared a heartfelt 
message following Aschoff’s death, 
expressing her sadness over his 
passing, citing the family’s positive 
experience with him in telling her 
son’s story.
“My heart is heavy,” Helaire 
wrote in a Twitter post Christmas 
morning. “I had the honor of meet-
ing this GREAT human being. A 
smile as bright & beautiful as the 
sun w/a personality to match. He 
said Clyde was a joy to interview. 
We talked a great deal as you can 
see; it’s the mother and nurse in 
me.”
Aschoff took pride in being able 
to connect with the subjects of 
his reporting to tell controversial, 
hot-button stories as they related 
to the sports world. In 2015, he 
co-wrote a story for ESPN about the 
racism college athletes encounter 
while on with fellow reporter Adam 
Rittenberg. Several football players 
shared heavy anecdotes about their 
own experiences for the piece. The 
reason why: Aschoff made them 
feel comfortable.
“Edward was also proud of being 
able to write stories that pushed 
boundaries,” Adelson said. “It’s 
really hard to broach subjects like 
(racism) that can be so polarizing. 
Because Edward was able to...
build relationships and trust, these 
players felt comfortable telling them 
some really uncomfortable things, 
and it turned into this award win-
ning piece.”
Aschoff’s thoughtfulness showed 
itself in these stories and his interac-
tions with those he had worked 
with in the past.
Whenever his job at ESPN 
landed him in the press box at Ben 
Hill Griffin Stadium, Aschoff always 
made sure that he spoke to Arnold 
Feliciano, the sports editor for the 
Gainesville Sun who hired him dur-
ing his time at UF.
“I remember the last time we 
talked was at last year’s LSU game,” 
Feliciano said. “And he just came 
up to me -- and he always did if we 
bumped into each other in the press 
box -- and just put his arm around 
me and just said, ‘Hey, how ya do-ing?’... And I told him face-to-face, 
‘You know, Edward, we’re really 
proud of you.’...And he kind of 
looked at me, smiled and hugged 
me.”
Aschoff was also extremely 
grateful for the J-school and the 
lessons he learned while enrolled 
there. His affection for the orange 
and blue made way for an enduring 
friendship with fellow Gator-grad 
Adelson.
“You’re talking about two 
students who were in the journal-
ism school,” Adelson said, “who 
graduated about nine years apart 
from the journalism school, and 
we still had that connection with 
Florida because of what the J-school 
did for us.”
The two spent Thanksgiving 
weekend together in Ann Arbor, 
Michigan, for this season’s match 
up between Michigan and Ohio 
State. Adelson’s husband is an Ann 
Arbor native, so when she caught 
wind of Aschoff’s assignment, she 
insisted that he come over to her 
mother-in-law’s house for Thanks-
giving dinner and to watch the 
infamous Egg Bowl -- a game that 
had extra sentimental value for the 
Rebel by blood.
With The Game, between 
Michigan and Ohio State, kicking 
off at noon, there was plenty of time 
for Aschoff and Adelson to wrap 
up their post-game duties and still 
catch the most anticipated rivalry 
game of their alma mater, UF-FSU, 
which started that night.
“He said, ‘I know I’m not feeling 
great, but we have to go and watch 
the Florida-Florida State game after 
tonight,’” Adelson said.
In a sea of Big Blue fans, Aschoff 
repped a vintage Gator hat. Adelson 
told him that she needed to get one 
just like it.
“Now that I look back on it, after 
everything that’s happened, I am 
just so grateful that we had that ex-
tra time to spend together and that 
Florida football was involved.”
Her last game in the Swamp with Aschoff was the same game versus 
LSU in 2018. Afterwards, the two 
walked down Gale Lemerand Drive 
and across University Avenue for 
a night cap at the famed Swamp 
restaurant.
“It was awesome to be there 
together with him in the place that 
helped both of our dreams come 
true,” Adelson remembered. “After 
the game, we went over to The 
Swamp and hung out and re-lived 
our days as students -- I think he 
probably spent more time as a 
student at The Swamp than I did, 
but it felt like home. It felt like 
family being together with him in 
Gainesville. Even though our time 
there at school was never together, 
it just felt normal and right for us to 
be there together at Florida.”
On Sunday, ESPN had a memo-
rial for Aschoff in Atlanta at the Col-
lege Football Hall of Fame. Adelson 
said that about 250 people attended.
Students, professors across all 
subjects and visitors of the Univer-
sity of Florida from this semester 
forward: Remember Aschoff as you 
walk through the breezeway at 
Weimer Hall. Think about the fact 
that you stand where he once stood.
The greatest lesson to learn from 
Edward Aschoff’s story -- whether 
it be from the vantage point of a stu-
dent aspiring for something great, a 
peer mourning the loss of a sports 
media maestro or simply a fan of his 
work -- is that we should all strive 
to work as hard and emanate so 
much light. We should all work as 
hard, listen as intently and care as 
deeply as he did.
“He was going to do so much 
more for people and the commu-
nity,” Feldman said. “And I think 
it’s on us now.”

Guard Andrew Nembhard scored a career-high 25 points and led 
all scorers in UF's double overtime win over Alabama.
blocks.
Is this where the turnaround begins?
It’s felt like the Gators have had several mo-
ments this season where they were finally going to 
turn into one of the top teams in the country like 
many believed they were before the season began.
This same question was asked after UF won the 
Charleston Classic, after the Gators rolled through 
a decent Providence team and now after a miracle 
comeback win to start conference play.
Yet two games after the Charleston Classic, Flor-
ida was demolished by Butler. It lost to Utah State 
after one of its worst offensive performances of the 
season. Now, the Gators have another opportunity 
to finally get some momentum going.
It’s worth noting that Alabama is a better team 
than its 7-6 record suggests. The Crimson Tide 
play at one of the fastest paces in the country, and 
much like Marshall earlier in the season, its hectic style gave the Gators fits. Combine that with a 
lights-out shooting performance in the first half (48 
percent from the field, 50 percent from three) and 
another cold start for Florida, and it looked ugly.
But the Gators’ offense woke up in the second 
half and Alabama came back down to earth as Flor-
ida earned its first conference win of the season.
The schedule gets easier from here as well -- for 
now. None of UF’s next three opponents - South 
Carolina, Missouri and Ole Miss -- are ranked in 
the top 50 according to KenPom.
A 4-0 start to conference play would not only 
boost the team’s confidence, but it might be a 
necessity as the Gators face two of the best SEC 
teams in No. 8 Auburn (13-0, 1-0 SEC) and LSU (9-
4, 1-0 SEC) before a showdown with No. 6 Baylor 
(11-1, 1-0 Big 12).
But these next three games will likely determine 
if this young but talented team is making strides or 
if all of the preseason hype was for nothing.

Williams and another Smith layup the next possession, 
gave UF a 29-27 lead and major momentum.
Offensively everything threaded together for Florida. 
The outside shooting started to fall after starting 1 of 5 
from beyond the arc. Then after Vandy began to suffocate 
shooters, Williams had room inside to work. After a 
scoreless first quarter, she finished the game with 10 points at a 63 percent clip.
“If it’s meant for me to score, I will,” Williams said. 
“Just staying steady knowing not to rush anything.”
But early in the fourth quarter, Vandy made a run. 
Commodore forward Koi Love led the resurgence 
with 19 points, most of those coming in the second 
half. However, a Smith three, a Williams steal and a 
Vanderbilt travel got the Gators back up to a sizeable 61-
54 advantage with under two minutes to play.
That ultimately iced the game, giving Florida an enormous SEC win to bounce back from the loss in 
Starkville.
“Happy to get this win at home and be 1-1 in the 
SEC,” coach Cam Newbauer said.
