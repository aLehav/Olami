Pedro Bravo, 19, is led into the courtroom by Alachua County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce deputies during Tuesday’s case man-
agement hearing at the Alachua County Courthouse.
PEDRO BRAVO CASE
CHRIS ALCANTARA
Alligator Staff Writer
With the impending retirement of the Alachua 
County judge presiding over the Pedro Bravo case, 
state prosecutors said they planned to submit a mo-tion for review by the new judge in the summer. 
During the Tuesday hearing, prosecutors said a 
pretrial and discovery schedule motion would be ﬁ  led with Judge Martha Lott’s successor. Lott is scheduled to retire May 31, and the next case management hear-ing is set for June 11.
The decision once again delayed the case, which 
began seven months ago when Christian Aguilar was reported missing.
Bravo, the 19-year-old Santa Fe College student 
accused of murdering Aguilar in September, faces multiple felony and misdemeanor charges, including premeditated murder — a capital offense.
Darry Lloyd, spokesman for the 8th Judicial Cir-
cuit of the State Attorney’s Ofﬁ  ce, couldn’t say when a trial would be set.
“We would hope it will be this year,” he said.If the motion passes, Lloyd said attorneys on both 
sides will plan depositions for witnesses and investi-gators as well as begin to review evidence.
Aguilar’s family and supporters — most of who 
drove up from Doral to attend — wore white T-shirts with a photo of Aguilar and “Justice For Chris”  writ-ten at the bottom.
Aguilar’s father, Carlos Aguilar, said he was dis-
appointed with the delays and the case’s slow pro-gression.
“It’s devastating for our family and completely 
frustrating for us,” he said.

UF students will be able to 
check out one of the 30 avail-
able Apple iPads from Library West when Summer A begins.
Students may request an 
iPad on a ﬁ  rst-come, ﬁ  rst-served basis on the 2nd Floor Circula-tion Desk within the next few weeks, said Stacey Ewing, re-search librarian at the library.
The network cart was in-
stalled about two weeks ago. Since then, IT ran into technical issues with resetting the tablets after they were returned to the cart, Ewing said.
The 16 GB iPads, only avail-able to students, were pur-chased with funds from the UF Student Technology Fee and Student Government.
When students check out an 
iPad, they will also receive its charger, a USB cable, a carrying case and a print guide, Ewing said.
The seven-day rental tablets 
come preconﬁ  gured with apps such as Dropbox, Pandora and Nook. Students will be charged $10 per overdue hour. After 10 hours, the item is considered lost with a ﬁ  ne up to $1,000.
Angie Alvarado-Sobrino, an 
18-year-old UF business fresh-man, said she thinks students will use the tablets for plea-sure.
“It’s nice to see Library West 
growing with today’s techni-cal advances,” she said, “but I don’t think the iPads will out-shine all of the other resources that Library West has to offer — especially the books.”
Ewing said if all goes well, 
other campus libraries will get iPads in the Fall.iPads available at Library West

Hurricane season starts June 1, 
but people in hurricane-prone areas 
should start preparing now.
Katherine Ellison, a corporate 
communications specialist for The Home Depot, said although the Southeastern region stores increase storm supplies during hurricane season, these stores are typically prepared year round.
“Storms can come early in the season. Hurricanes can come later in the season,” she said. “You just never know.”
Florida is not a stranger to hur-
ricanes.
“The common theme is that an 
above-active season is expected ... according to climatology,” said UF Chief Meteorologist Jeff Huffman. “Much of the Southeast United States, including Florida, is overdue for a landfalling, major hurricane.”
Huffman said he expects the Na-
tional Hurricane Center to release its predicted storm forecast during the week of May 27.Florida expects above-
active hurricane season

“No matter what the predic-
tion is for the number of storms, 
it only takes one that can result in major impacts,” he said.
Huffman said his team is 
preparing for the season by participating in a WRUF mul-timedia properties hurricane drill from May 27 to May 31. His team will test the systems set up to cover major storms.
UF Emergency Management 
Coordinator Kenneth Allen said UF students and faculty should get ready for hurricane season now.
“We want people to be pre-
pared all year long,” he said.
UF’s plan during emergency 
differs for on-campus and off-campus students. On-campus students would take shelter in their dorms. Those in gradu-ate and family housing would take shelter in their homes. If the emergency were to extend more than 24 hours, Gator Din-ing would provide food to resi-dents.
Off-campus students would 
be welcome to stay at a shelter provided by UF, Allen said, but would not be provided food via Gator Dining.
“I stress, they’re members of 
the community and need to be prepared,” he said.
Off-campus residents are 
expected to follow city guide-lines and instructions, such as curfews and boiling water, dur-ing a storm.
UF is not responsible for 
damages to residents’ belong-ings.
“Stock up on things you 
know you’re going to need,” said Ellison, from The Home Depot. “Safety is definitely a priority.”4, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, APRIL 24, 2013

Matthew Price went out with his 
brother in Austin, Texas last Decem-
ber. After a night on the town, Price did the right thing: He called a cab.
Price, then a student enrolled in 
UF’s one-year professional master’s degree in business administration and a financial analyst at Tropicana Products in Bradenton, was home on vacation for Winter Break. But that night on the freeway, his life changed forever.
While on the way home, the taxi 
stalled on the freeway in the right-hand lane. A drunk driver didn’t see the car and pummeled the cab.
His brother walked away with 
few injuries. But Price didn’t.
Not only did he suffer a few 
broken bones, but the crash also shocked his spinal cord. Now, the 29-year-old is paralyzed from the mid-chest down. He can flex his ab muscles and wiggle his toes, but he cannot use his legs.
“There’s no real way of know-ing if my legs will come back,” Price said.
He began to miss his monthly 
meetings in the business program. A few of his classmates in his co-hort of about 65 students began to notice. Price’s friend German Escal-lon heard about Price’s injuries from another classmate. Escallon, who is currently working on building a nonprofit organization with his brother, decided to rally their class-mates to support Price.
“We’re closer than most of the 
cohorts,” the 29-year-old UF alum-nus said. “We really developed something special.”
Escallon heard about Price’s 
friends sponsoring a golf tourna-ment in his name, but he wanted to do something within the UF com-munity.
He started MBAs for Matt and began a GiveForward page to collect donations for Price’s hospital bills.
Price attends in-patient therapy 
for about five hours, five days a week for the next month. For the rest of the year, he must undergo about an hour of outpatient therapy five days a week.
The therapy bills add up, and 
Price has to pay out of pocket. His hospital stay alone was $300,000.
In just two weeks, Escallon raised 
$6,669 for Price, which surpassed the goal of $5,000.
“We were overwhelmed by the 
support that we received,” Escallon said.
At the program’s graduation 
reception held in the Touchdown Terrace April 14, Price was given a signed picture of Novak Djokovic with a personal message from the tennis pro.
“To get a picture that is signed by 
my favorite tennis player and hav-ing him hear my story really meant a lot to me,” Price said.

At the final Student Senate meeting of the semester, 
senators’ goodbye speeches were overshadowed by one 
Replacement and Agenda Committee recommendation Tuesday night.
Several senators were concerned about Sen. Leah Mill-
er’s appointment to the Rules and Ethics Committee. 
In February, Miller was mired in scandal a in which she 
wrote an email that was leaked. As the Swamp Party liaison to its fraternity house representatives during last month’s Student Government elections, she wrote to 25 representa-tives asking them to collect “I Voted” stickers and supply the party with a $250 check.
The final lines of Miller’s email read: “DELETE THIS AF-
TER YOU GET THE INFORMATION!! WE CANT HAVE ANYTHING ON RECORD! Sketchy, but do it! Thanks!”
Sen. Paul O’Quinn said that although he voted in favor 
of Miller’s appointment as a District A senator, he would not support her nomination to the committee. 
“It’s greedy in that capacity,” he said. “I think there’s a 
fine line.”
Sen. Joseph Michaels defended Miller and said many 
people get heated during election season.
“I don’t think we should be judging someone on what 
they’ve done in the past,” he said.
The Senate approved Miller in a roll call vote with a ma-
jority of 39 yeas against 21 nays. Six senators abstained.
Miller declined to comment after the meeting.Contact Colleen Wright at cwright@alligator.org.WEDNESDAY, APRIL 24, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 5

� POLICE COULDN’T FIND THE MAN.

Gainesville Police is looking for a man who gagged 
and threatened a woman at a southwest Gainesville apartment complex early Tuesday.
At about 2 a.m., GPD officers responded to the 
Campus Lodge apartment complex, located at 2800 SW Williston Road, after the woman called and re-ported a man attacked her as she was walking to her car in the parking lot, said GPD spokesman Officer Ben Tobias.
The man, wearing a black mask and gloves, walked 
up to the woman from behind and put a gag over her mouth. He then covered her eyes with his hand and put what the woman believed to be a gun to her head, Tobias said. 
The man threatened the woman then forced her to 
the ground while he tied her hands together, Tobias said.
The woman kicked the man, ran back to her apart-
ment and called police. A GPD officer and a police dog searched the area but couldn’t find the man.
Tobias said it‘s unknown if the incident was relat-
ed to an April 15 robbery and sexual assault in which the suspect has not been located.
GPD is still investigating the case and requests 
anyone with information call GPD detectives at 352-393-7670, text an anonymous tip to 274637 with key-word “GPDFL” plus your tip or call the anonymous tip line at 352-393-7700.

OPINIONS EDITORToday’s question: Are you going home for the summer?
293 TOTAL VOTES68% YES
32% NOTuesday’s question: Have you ever taken 
acid?Libertarians do not hate poor people
When discussing politics in the United States, we 
hear a lot of false dichotomies.
We’re all supposed to ﬁ  t into certain cat-
egories: left or right, liberal or conservative, Democrat or Republican. For speciﬁ  c issues, you’re supposed to be either abortion rights or anti-abortion; pro-gay mar-riage or pro-traditional marriage; for higher taxes on the wealthy or for lower taxes.
When I tell people I’m a Libertarian, many of them as-
sume I’m socially liberal and ﬁ  scally conservative based on the established dichotomy of beliefs.
But the fact of the matter is many of my positions, 
like many other Libertarians, do not ﬁ  t nicely into these categories.
A conservative like Paul Ryan might argue to create 
a voucher program to reform Medicare in an attempt to reduce its burden on the federal budget. For many on the left, support for this reform means Ryan and other Republicans hate poor people and the elderly and want them to suffer.
Despite scare tactics and hyperbole from many liber-
als, Ryan does likely favor keeping some type of govern-ment-sponsored social safety net for the least fortunate.
So when most Libertarians, such as myself, support 
abolishing programs like Medicare altogether, the re-sponses are even worse.
Again, with support of this position, people develop 
a false dichotomy in their heads. If you support policy A, then you support the goals of policy A. If you oppose policy A, then you oppose the goals of policy A.
To continue with the Medicare example, if you sup-
port Medicare, then you support helping older people who might not be able to afford health care. Therefore, if you oppose Medicare, then you oppose helping the poor and the elderly to afford health care.    
However, Libertarians do not oppose Medicare be-
cause we hate the people the program is trying to help or believe these people should suffer.
Instead, we oppose the policy because we believe the 
market through voluntary exchange and a more efﬁ  cient allocation of resources can provide better and cheaper health care.
We also believe programs 
like Medicare distort people’s abilities to use prices to deter-mine the best course of care, allow health care providers and insurers to abuse the sys-tem and create a culture of de-
pendency among those who might not necessarily need the support.
Furthermore, we believe there are more choices than 
just having Medicare and not having Medicare. There is also private charity and other forms of support through voluntary exchanges.
Finally, many Libertarians have ethical issues with 
programs like Medicare. The program is built on forcing people to save for health care at an early age (through the FICA payroll tax) when they otherwise might not. 
Although saving for retirement and health care might 
be a noble goal, the government should not have the right to hold a gun to people’s heads and force them to save. People should be allowed to make choices and suffer the consequences, whether they are positive or negative.
In a Libertarian society, or a society without a safety 
net, if someone tries to save for later in life but, because of bad luck and unforeseen circumstances, loses all of his or her savings, the Libertarian does not say, “Screw you!”
Just because you do not support a government pro-
gram does not mean you lack compassion.
It means Libertarians support the creation of more 
voluntary associations to help people who fall on hard times rather than a government that inﬂ  ates prices, ra-tions services and forces citizens to spend their income in ways that a bunch of politicians believe they should.   
Justin Hayes is pursuing a master’s degree in political 
communication. His column appears on Wednesdays.I never imagined I’d run a newsroom.
To be honest, I never thought I’d be a journalist.
I’m timid. I’m shy. I’m slightly awkward. I’m nowhere 
near conﬁ  dent enough to run a staff of about 40 people and make editorial decisions on a daily basis.
But I did.When I took on the role of editor in January, I led our ﬁ  rst 
meeting, facing my fresh-faced staff, with a slight shake in my voice.
I quickly learned to stand behind each decision I made. I 
grew closer with my staff, and I began losing my hair.
I also lost a great amount of sleep, drank a lot of Karma 
Cream coffee and took naps in my ofﬁ  ce when I had the chance.
It was stressful. Some nights, I’d leave the ofﬁ  ce cry-
ing and hating every part of my job. The angry reader phone calls, the law-suit threats and the big-case stories all left me overwhelmed.
Most nights, though, I left with a 
smile on my face.
I began to realize that every moment I spent stressed and 
exhausted was not for me, but for my staff. 
And above all else, for the good of the paper — for the read-
ers.
Things got easier.I began to get involved.I dabbled in reporting — the ﬁ  rst time since professor Fo-
ley’s dreaded class. I even had a photo printed in the paper. 
I grew to love my staff members, who are not only my col-
leagues, but my friends. My family.
Sitting here now, I know that becoming the editor was the 
right decision. 
Sure, it was hard. But it was worth it.Working at the Alligator has been the highlight of my col-
lege years. 
I will always look back on my experiences and memories 
I’ve shared in the dirty, sometimes smelly, newsroom because it was where I found my place. My niche. My people.
I will never forget our ceaseless budget meetings, awk-
ward, speech-style staff meetings or adrenaline-driven break-ing news coverage.
I will never forget Taco Tuesday runs, that time we made a 
“Harlem Shake” video or the extensive photo shoots. 
Most important, though, I will never forget any of you. I 
couldn’t have done it without you.
I’m just not ready to move on.So, until next time, see ya later, Alligator.Saying goodbye 
for now 
but not forever

Look to your left, then to your right.
Do you see a camera?
You should.
If not, one of your closest friends will soon pick a camera up and 
begin the journey as your group’s historian.
Treasure this person. He or she chose to forgo some of the great-
est moments of their college career to capture them behind a 5-inch black lens.
This is so important, because, I’m sorry to say Instagram doesn’t 
count as photojournalism. 
There is something to be said for the 
wallﬂ  ower. 
For the silent soul who posts and tags 
you on Facebook hours later, for the per-
son who will give you your graduation photos — the only person who has photos of you and your sweetheart as you awkwardly pretended you didn’t want to be together.
Three cheers for you, Ansel-Adams-to-be.One for taking the backseat in others’ stories.Two for shooting frequently.Three for getting better each day.Every moment of your journey — from the ﬁ  rst awkward shot 
of your sister trying to smile to that time you drop it in the water trying to take an artsy photo — your pursuit is an art. And I wish someone had told me that sooner.
So to you: Continue shooting.To your friends: STOP LOOKING AT THE CAMERA.And to the parents: Give your children a little extra money for 
a ﬁ  sheye.
The product is immeasurable, I promise.In conclusion:How do I plan to wrap up four years?Teary-eyed and alone, with a bottle of wine and “Graduation” 
by Vitamin C on blast?
No, thank you.I choose my photos.The more than two million snapshots mashed together on Fa-
cebook, Instagram and my computer’s hard drive may never be printed and might even be forgotten. 
But the joy of the moments captured will make Gainesville 
more than just a pit stop in my life.

editorial and editing the columnists you see ﬁ  lling our pages every day since August 2012. I’ve been man-be-hind-the-curtaining you for quite some time, which I don’t think many people realize because I’ve been us-ing the veil of third-person pronouns since day one.
It’s been quite a ride during the past two semes-

“We’re all in this together,” to quote “High School 
Musical.” 
We can do anything we put our minds to.For me personally, it’s basically a miracle I’ll be 
graduating. The secret that a lot of my friends don’t realize is I’m a horrible student. If I took a class I didn’t super-care about, my grade reﬂ  ected it. 
Getting me to the graduation stage took a whole 
team of people — for that, I’m eternally grateful.
One of my prized possessions is the fact that I 
earned the president of Theatre Strike Force posi-tion. Without that club and its constant tomfoolery, I wouldn’t be as conﬁ  dent or as self-deprecating as I am today.
Of course, my time here at the Alligator has also 
shaped me as a person. 
I started as a blogger and wrote about the comedy 
scene in Gainesville. I probably used it as a way to plug TSF more times than what should be legally pos-sible, so I followed my previous TSF/Alligator breth-ren. I wrote columns, I edited the Avenue and I wrote more columns from my sunny home in Kissimmee. All of those experiences led me to be Justin Hayes’ choice of op-ed successor. If he wasn’t busy being a badass graduate student, I wouldn’t have this job at all.
And so, as we enter the sunset of our youth — I’ve 
heard terrible things about being a real adult in the real world with a real job and real problems — take it to heart that you’re not alone.
We’ve all dealt with some very awful tragedies 
during my time as editor. 
(Some conservative old guy will email me saying 
the true tragedy was Obama’s re-election.) 
But thankfully, we made it to the other side.And yes, those are our real names.Sami Main is the opinions editor. She is a journalism

Both 32-ounce jugs and one-gallon jugs of beer, sold at Swamp Head Brewery, are legal 
container sizes in Florida. Lobbyists are trying to legalize the 64-ounce size beverages.
ALEX HARRIS
Alligator Contributing Writer
Florida’s beer industry is on tap for new 
legislation involving the sizing of jugs of 
beer, commonly known as growlers, sold at breweries.
Due to an old state law, brewery patrons 
can legally purchase as many 32-ounce and 1-gallon growlers as they’d like, but 64-ounce growlers may not be filled, even though that’s the industry standard in most other states.
Mitch Rubin, a lobbyist for the Florida 
Beer Wholesalers Association, opposed both bills that would have legalized filling the 64-ounce containers.  
He said he spoke against the bills to 
protect the three-tiered system of beer dis-tribution.
In the system, distributors act as  mid-
dlemen between retailers and brewers. They exist to stop vertical integration among the retailers, the distributors and the brewers, Rubin said.
Swamp Head Brewery, in particular, has voiced its opinion on the subject on its website, where it states that people who seek to buy beer can choose between “the giganto gallon jug or the Red Stripe on ste-roids 32 oz. growler.“
Swamp Head credits this policy to “an 
antiquated Florida law.”
“In the coming year, we plan on pushing 
for new legislation to legalize the 64-ounce container,” Rubin said. “Our main concern lies in closing the loopholes currently open in the system.”
Casey Davis, a 21-year-old UF account-
ing senior, said he thinks the system is eco-nomically inefficient.
“If the bigger one is cheaper compared 
to the lower size, then I’d want to buy the bigger one,” he said, “even if I wasn’t go-ing to finish it that night.”Florida beer brewers want to fill their growlers to the top
“In the coming year, we plan 
on pushing for new legislation to 
legalize the 64-ounce container.”

From 7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., Sustainable UF is hosting REthink 
Collection Day — an opportunity to donate unwanted clothes, 
food, household items and school supplies.
Items will be collected at the Stephen C. O’Connell Center 
near Gate 1 and the parking lot. The items will then be donated to charities. Personal hazardous waste and electronic waste will also be accepted and taken to the Alachua County Haz-ardous Waste Collection Facility. Among the items included are poisons, flammable liquids, corrosives, medications, brake fluid, stale gas, fluorescent lamps and unrepairable electronics, according to Sustainable UF’s website.
Kelly Amorgianos, a 20-year-old UF political science senior, 
took a sustainability course that sparked her interest in the en-vironment.
“It’s awesome how the university has students involved 
with helping the environment,” she said.
Amorgianos said throughout her time at UF, she thought 
the campus had a great way of reminding people about the im-portance of saving energy, properly disposing waste and keep-ing the environment clean.
Vanessa Tritsarolis, 23, graduated from UF last year with a 
public relations degree and sustainability minor.

Michael Terry clearly remembers 
the hours before his friends died in the 
early morning of October 16, 2011.
They were at Froggy’s Saloon in 
Daytona during Biketober Fest. Terry’s friends  Javier Remonsanzol and fian-cee Allison Sellers were getting ready to leave at about 1 a.m. Terry tried to get them to stay the night, but Remon-sanzol wanted to sleep in his own bed at home in Sanford. Then they said their goodbyes.
At about 2:30 a.m., Terry received 
a call from Remonsanzol. The couple were at Denny’s eating breakfast. They were safe, Remonsanzol said over the phone.
Terry didn’t know that was the last 
time he would talk to his friend. He didn’t know that about two hours lat-er, an SUV would drive up behind the couple riding on Remonsanzol’s mo-torcycle on Interstate 4 and hit them. He didn’t know that Sellers, 32, would hit the shoulder, dying on impact, and that Remonsanzol, 34, would fly into the road and get run over over by mul-tiple cars before he died.
“I really couldn’t comprehend it 
that well,” Terry, 45, said, “that it hap-pened to my friends of all of the people out there.”
Remonsanzol and Sellers were part 
of 8,621 people involved in motorcycle crashes in 2011 in Florida, an increase of 15 percent from 2010, according to the most recent data from the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles.
From 2000 to 2010, the number of 
motorcycle crashes and injuries in-creased overall, according to a study from the Florida Department of Trans-portation and the University of South Florida Center for Urban Transporta-tion Research.
Chanyoung Lee, a senior researcher 
at the USF center, said this spike could be the product of a few reasons.
Motorcycle registration has more 
than doubled in the 10-year period, he said. And in 2000, Florida passed a law that allowed motorcyclists over the age of 21 to ride without a helmet if they had at least a $10,000 insurance policy, he said.
Motorcyclists have a much higher 
risk of crashing on their own as well, Lee said. About 30 percent of motor-cycle crashes do not involve a second vehicle.
However, in cases of two-vehicle 
crashes like Remonsanzol’s and Sell-ers’, automobile drivers were found to be at fault about 60 percent of the time. 
Lee said car drivers don’t expect to 
see a motorcycle and underestimate how much space it takes up on the road.
“People have a tendency to make a 
judgment based on the size of the ob-ject,” he said.
Back at the scene of the crash, Flori-
da Highway Patrol troopers could not find the car believed to have hit Re-monsanzol and Sellers.
Meanwhile, a police officer traveling 
to the accident recognized a 2007 Ford Explorer that matched the description of the vehicle involved in the crash pulled over on the side of a road off In-terstate 4 not far from the accident. The car was driven by UF student Rita Lau-rie Carter, then 19, who troopers now believe is responsible.
Officials tested her blood alcohol 
content level, and it was reported to be .043 about three hours after the crash. Using a mathematical process called retrograde extrapolation, officials found that her BAC level at the time of the crash was .095. The legal limit is .08, according to Florida Highway Patrol. 
After a year-and-a-half-long FHP 
investigation, officials connected Carter to the crash. She now faces two counts of DUI manslaughter and two counts of leaving the scene of a fatal crash, among other charges.
And after a year and a half, Remon-
sanzol’s and Sellers’ family and friends are still reeling.
“It was so painful I still can’t even 
believe it,” said Sellers’ best friend of 26 years, Samantha Schmidt, who va-cationed with Sellers just two weeks before her death.
She won’t even touch a motorcycle.Schmidt’s father, Greg Bush, 64, and 
Terry were in the process of building a bike for Sellers. Now, it won’t be rid-den, he said.
Bush still rides his own motorcycle 
but looks behind him more often after the accident.
Since the crash, Terry remembers 
the hours before he lost his friends. 
He wonders, too, about what 
would’ve happened if he left with Sell-ers and Remonsanzol that night.
“Maybe if I could’ve been there, I 
could’ve helped out,” he said. “Maybe I would’ve died. You just never know.”

UF has proven its green potential, winning first place in 
the Environmental Protection Agency’s first Campus Rain-
Works Challenge in the large institution category. The team that represented UF earned $2,500 and an $11,000 grant to monitor the improvements of its design.
The challenge required the 218 teams of aspiring land-
scape architects, planners and engineers to design an in-novative green infrastructure system that would reduce stormwater pollution and support sustainable communi-ties. The winners were selected after three rounds by a team of 33 judges.
UF’s team consisted of 12 students studying landscape 
architecture, environmental engineering and agricultural and biological engineering.
Glenn Acomb, landscape architecture senior lecturer 
and faculty adviser, said he found out about the challenge last summer and thought it was “right up their alley.”
“Landscape architecture is, in many ways, a unique 
blend of art and science,” he said. “So green infrastructure is an integral part of what we do.”
The team chose the North Lawn as the site of its project.Landscape architecture senior and team project manager 
Emily Sturm said the project dealt with cleaning the storm-water from the lawn during its journey to Lake Alice.
“The inspiration behind our design was conveying the 
‘journey of water,’” Sturm, 23, said. She said the proposal would lead to cleaner water.
The team was honored at the ceremony with the EPA on 
Monday. Its designs are now on the EPA’s website.
“The students were commenting that it’s another na-
tional championship for the Gators,” Acomb said. “They were really quite proud.”UF takes first in

On Monday, Gov. Rick Scott signed the 
Career and Professional Education Act, which 
will boost education in public schools, commu-nity colleges and universities.
The legislation will enable state universities 
to qualify as “preeminent research universi-ties,” and receive additional money for online initiatives and high-tech degree programs.
Based on student performance, retention 
rates, research spending and national rank-ings, UF has met the requirements to be named a “preeminent research university,” and will receive additional funds.
Jen Belew, a 22-year-old elementary educa-
tion junior, said she thought using the money to add more online classes would help students who can’t commute to campus.“It’s definitely a good thing,” she said.UF President Bernie Machen said the bill 
will help the university achieve its goal of becoming a top 10 university, according to a news release.
“This bill finally sets in place some of the 
key pieces we need to head down that road,” he said according to the news release. “Thanks to the vision of House Speaker Will Weather-ford, it also awards UF the state online degree institute and puts us at the forefront of online learning.”
The legislation will enable state colleges to 
offer degrees for $10,000, according to a news release on Scott’s website. All of the 23 Florida community colleges that have a bachelor’s de-gree program have accepted Scott’s proposal to offer services for that price.
Katie Stults, a 21-year-old elementary edu-
cation junior, said she thought the lower costs could affect college departments’ resources.
“But ultimately, I think it’s a great thing,” 
she said.

HIGH SPRINGS — The popcorn 
machine glowed against the red tile floor and white brick walls inside the Priest Theater.
Nearby, Janet Alligood sat in the 
glass ticket booth Monday, chatting with patrons and selling $3 tick-ets to the 8 p.m. showing of “The Croods.”
As Alligood tore a ticket off the 
roll for a man, he asked if a particu-lar soon-to-be-released film would take the screen.
“I’ll try to get it,” Alligood said. 
“It’s on my list.”
What Alligood didn’t say is that 
she hopes her list won’t be gone for good. The 103-year-old theater that Alligood’s family has owned for the past three decades is being threat-ened by the film industry’s switch to digital.
21st Century Fox announced that 
this summer, it will discontinue 35-millimeter film reels — the type the theater plays every week. Other film companies are expected to follow suit by the end of the year.
Upgrading would require $85,000 
to get digital equipment. The family has been working to garner pledges through an online fundraising page on  Kickstarter to buy a digital pro-jector to replace the reel projector, which dates back to the 1940s.
The website keeps track of con-
tributors but doesn’t withdraw the money from their accounts until the end date of the campaign. If the Al-ligoods don’t reach the goal by June 3, all of the pledges will be erased.
“It’s all, or none,” said Alan Al-
ligood, Janet’s husband.
With 40 days left in the campaign, 
the theater has raised about $14,000. For now, donation envelopes sit on glass display cases in the lobby, and a thermometer banner tracks the fundraising progress on the outside of the building.
Carol Hunn, a 46-year-old Ala-
chua resident, stood in line with her two daughters to buy popcorn right before the show started. She said her family appreciates the atmosphere of the theater.
“It does have a real sense of fam-
ily,” she said. “It’s more ...”
Her 13-year-old daughter, Me-
gan, finished her sentence.

Alachua County has the fourth high-
est rate of sexually transmitted diseases 
in Florida. According to data released last month by the Florida Department of Health, the county had a rate of 904.3 per 100,000 people, ranking it fourth behind Hamilton, Leon and Gadsden counties.
The data showed 15- to 24-year-olds 
are most affected. Teresa Mercado-White said chlamydia is the No. 1 STD affecting people in these age groups.
Mercado-White, a minority AIDS co-
ordinator for the Alachua County Health Department, said the rate is high because of the increase in the number of people getting tested.
“People are passing it around like 
pudding,” she said.
Samantha Evans, a sexual health edu-
cator with GatorWell Health Promotion Services, agreed. She said the more peo-ple who get tested, the larger the poten-tial to see those tests come back positive.Evans said the high numbers of STDs 
may still be a reason for concern, adding that there needs to be continued support for educational programs.
“Continued funding and even more 
resources need to be available to the orga-nizations with preventative programs,” she said.
Isis Barnes, a 20-year-old UF biology 
sophomore and the incoming president of Respect Yourself, Check Yourself, Protect Yourself Movement at UF, said students should receive sex education before attending college.
Unfortunately, this is often not the 
case, she said.
“I feel like it could be broadened or 
taken to another level because obviously, what we’re doing is not working,” she said.STD rates high in AlachuaCOUNTY

Getting fired on the basis of 
identity may be a thing of the 
past. Federal law prohibits dis-crimination in the workplace on the basis of race, religion and eth-nicity.
However, Florida does not 
have a state law to protect resi-dents from sexual orientation discrimination in the workplace, said Emma Humphries, an assis-tant in citizenship at the Bob Gra-ham Center for Public Service.
A new survey by the Gra-
ham Center found 73 percent of Floridian respondents support the Competitive Workforce Act. The act would update the state’s Civil Rights Act of 1992 to in-clude protections against sexual-orientation and gender-identity discrimination. The survey was co-sponsored by the Bureau of Economic and Business Re-search.
“That’s pretty strong support 
in Florida,” Humphries said. “We’re a politically diverse state that doesn’t agree on too many issues.”
She said Floridians should know about the legislation, and legislators should know how Flo-ridians feel about it.
“LGBTQ students should 
want to know if Florida law pro-tects them in the workplace,” Humphries said. “Right now it does not.”
Jodi Schorb, a UF assistant 
professor of English and member of the UF LGBT Concerns Com-mittee, wrote in an email that she imagines students would find the issue problematic.
“It’s perfectly legal in Florida 
to discriminate and deny any-one a job or a promotion based on sexual orientation or harass someone at workplace based upon their gender expression,” Schorb wrote.
UF is among the few higher-
education campuses in Florida that have taken action in recent years to implement protections against sexual orientation dis-crimination on campus.
UF Supreme Court Chief Jus-tice Matt Michel said UF requires all student organizations to in-clude a nondiscrimination clause in their constitutions.
“It makes sense to treat sexual 
orientation like gender, race, re-ligion and other categories we protect as a society,” Michel, a 28-year-old Spanish Ph.D. candidate and third-year law student said. “Not all places are as progressive and open-minded as the Univer-sity of Florida.”
Kenneth Wald, a distinguished 
professor of political science, said other schools have tried to imple-ment similar rules to ban discrim-ination but have not succeeded.
“Many who have tried to do 
this have been told by their law-yers that because it’s not illegal to discriminate based on sexual ori-entation in Florida, the campuses can’t go beyond state law,” Wald said.
He said UF’s policy is about 10 
years old.
“The American public has 
made a dramatic shift in attitudes toward rights of people and sexu-al orientation,” Wald said. “What we’re seeing in Florida, I think, echoes what we’re seeing on a national level.”

brates the end of the semester, is tonight.
Considering the recent trag-
edy at the Boston Marathon, Darcie Burde, assistant direc-tor of fitness for RecSports and event director, said UF RecS-ports is working with Univer-sity Police to implement addi-tional safety measures.
Sgt. Matt Davis said police 
officers will look for suspicious packages and activity during the event.
“[Our] diligence level and 
awareness will be higher be-cause of what happened in Boston,” he said.   The 5K run or 1.5-mile walk, 
hosted by UF RecSports, is open to UF students and their guests. Burde hopes about 1,500 people will participate.
Check-in starts at 10 p.m. 
in front of the Stephen C. O’Connell Center Gate 2. 
Participants must bring 
their Gator 1 Cards or other valid identification. UF stu-dents can register on-site for $12 with a check or  cash. It costs $20 for guests.
The run begins at 11:59 
p.m., and all participants will receive breakfast following the race.
Burde said there are no 
prizes for winners other than pride gained from finishing the race.
“We are as excited for any-
one who finishes or even at-tempts the run as we are for the first person who crosses the finish line,” she said.Spring Fun Run tonight

Last year, 991 UF students applied to law 
school, but not all of them planned to follow 
the traditional route.
According to a survey released by Kaplan 
Test Prep two weeks ago, 50 percent of pre-law students wanted to use their law degree in a nontraditional field. Legal traditional fields were listed as law firms and legal staff, and nontraditional fields were listed as business, academics and politics.
Of that 50 percent, 58 percent said the job 
market for lawyers factored in their decision. Overall, 71 percent listed passion as their main reason for going to law school, and only 5 per-cent listed salary potential.
Jeff Thomas, director of pre-law programs 
at Kaplan, said that a few years ago, salary po-tential was a big factor in the law school de-cision, but now, students seem to understand that jobs in private practice aren’t as plentiful.
“We are seeing a very purposeful, deliber-
ate and meaningful shift in the idea of a legal career,” he said.
He said UF is the second-largest feeder school to law schools in the country, second only to UCLA.
Kenway Wong has always wanted to be 
an attorney, and today’s job market has not changed his mind.
The 21-year-old political science senior 
plans to attend UF’s Levin College of Law af-ter graduation. He said his main reasons for choosing UF Law were his desire to practice in Florida and the cost.
“It’s common-sense financing,” he said.Survey shows more pre-law students seek nontraditional fields

For today’s students, distractions 
are common. Studying is often ac-
companied by vibrations from in-coming texts, Facebook notifications and tweets. This “mind wandering” leads to “impaired performance” of cognitive abilities, according to a study published last month in Psy-chological Science.
Researchers from the University 
of California, Santa Barbara, found that working memory improved and mind wandering decreased af-ter a group of undergraduates took a two-week-long mindfulness train-ing course, similar to meditation.
The class required subjects to attend daily meditation outside of their studies. People sat on cushions and completed mindfulness exer-cises.  These students saw improved test scores and increased capacity for working memory, according to the study.UF’s Counseling & Wellness 
Center runs a similar course on mindfulness-based stress reduction, called “Taming the Anxious Mind,” that lasts about 8 weeks, said Tina Tannen, a clinical assistant professor at the center.
“When you are mindful, you’re 
present,” she said. “You’re not think-ing about the next question or wor-rying about the question before.”
Carolina Garcia, a 21-year-old public relations junior, will teach a Ride and Relax class this Fall as a UF group fitness instructor. The class includes 45 minutes of cycling and 30 minutes of yoga. She said medita-tion helps reduce stress, which im-proves focus.
“People think you have to medi-
tate in this cross-legged position with your hands like a gypsy,” Gar-cia said. “When in reality, you can meditate lying down.”

Derek A. Smith / Alligator
Together for A Better Gainesville
At a roundtable discussion hosted by the City of Gainesville on Tuesday, City Commissioners and officials met 
with residents to discuss concerns and ideas regarding issues like public safety and transportation.
NICOLE ZAKRZEWSKI
Alligator Contributing Writer
Two years ago, as part of the 
City of Gainesville’s wellness 
initiative for their employees, the city began providing Zum-ba classes.
The classes were originally 
in the Gainesville Regional Utilities center  and held about 15 city employees. Within two classes, instructors Christiane Machado and Maria Adela Ramirez knew they had to ex-pand.
Soon after, the classes relo-
cated to the Thelma A. Boltin Center, located at 516 NE Sec-ond Ave. With a larger loca-tion, authorities agreed to open the Zumba classes to the public five times a week.
At first, there was some re-
sistance from the city due to li-abilities. Both sides — the city and the instructors — compro-mised that every person had to sign a waiver to participate.
Months after the classes 
opened to the public, children started attending with their parents. As part of the contract with the Zumba instructors and the city, no children were allowed for safety reasons.
Machado said since the 
classes began, no accidents oc-curred until April 15 when an adult student slipped.
Complaints about children 
attending led to a disagreement between the instructors and the Risk Management Department, which funded the classes.
Rod Clark, Program Coordi-
nator for the City of Gainesville, contacted Machado to cancel the classes April 15.
“Our job is to reduce the 
risk of people getting hurt,” he said.
Machado and Ramírez 
took the issue to the city. On Thursday, about 60 supporters marched to the Gainesville City Commission and gave emo-tional testimonies, including someone who overcame the ef-fects of a stroke after they start-ed attending Zumba classes.
“Zumba gives you a rush 
— we all say we get high off of Zumba,” Machado said.
The commission passed a 
motion to keep classes the go-ing. City Commissioner Todd Chase donated part of his 5 percent raise to continue the program.
The classes will be on hiatus 
from April 30 to May 15.
Once classes resume, the 
city will require participants to donate between $1 and $5 for the class, Machado said. Chase’s donation will be placed in a scholarship fund for those who cannot afford the class.
Now, children are allowed 
to attend the class. 
“It was the work of all of 
us,” Machado said. “We just want to shake our tail feathers. We don’t want to do no harm.”City Zumba classes

◗ REGISTRATION IS $50.

In about a week, the streets of 
Midtown and downtown will be 
packed with people ready to party.
The 31st annual Gator Stompin’ 
hosted by the Pledge 5 Foundation will from 9 p.m. to 2 a.m. May 2.
“It used to be just a pub crawl, 
but it’s a lot more than that now,” said Jason Bowman, the founda-tion’s director. He said about 100 restaurants, bars and nightclubs will participate this year to accommo-date the estimated 10,000 attendees.
Everyone who registers for the 
event will receive a T-shirt and 10 
tokens that can 
be used to pur-chase drinks and food, Bowman said. Registration is $50.
G a t o r 
Stompin’ sup-ports various lo-cal charities, but 
the majority of the money will go to the Pledge 5 Foundation.
“We’re growing almost quicker than we can keep up with, but as long as people keep coming to our events and giving back to the com-munity, I think we’re headed in the right direction,” Bowman said.
He said there will be a safe-ride 
program and shuttle system run-ning that night. 
Tony Riggio, a 20-year-old UF 
entomology and nematology junior, said he had always been under the impression that participants had to be at least 21 years old.
“Now that I know that there are 
a lot of things for me to do that don’t entail drinking, I definitely plan on going,” he said.31st Gator Stompin’ set for May 2

The Seattle Seahawks gave 
him a six-year contract worth 
$67 million after acquiring him from the Minnesota Vikings for a first-round pick and a seventh round pick in 2013 and a third round selection in 2014. That contract pays him $11.2 million annually, making Harvin the fifth highest-paid receiver in the league behind Calvin Johnson, Larry Fitzgerald, Mike Wallace and Dwayne Bowe. You hon-estly think Mercy Percy is on that same level?
That’s a fat wad of cash and 
checks. If I were playing in GM mode on Madden ’13 (not say-ing I do), Harvin would be a hot commodity. He’s fun to juke with, but he’s not reliable. Win-ning football teams are built from the inside out. You get the center, quarterback and running on offense, and the nose tackle, middle linebacker and safety on defense. It’s that simple.
Phil: Harvin’s injury concerns 
are a bit overblown compared to his talent. He is 24 years old and entering the prime of his career, which makes his contract pricey but not inflated. 
Prior to the 2012 campaign, 
he played in at least 14 games in each of his first three seasons. In 2011, he suited up for all 16. I be-lieve your choice missed the 2010 Super Bowl with his own injury problems, so let’s slow down a minute. 
The Seahawks have one of the 
top front offices in the NFL. They had the cojones to draft and start Russell Wilson ahead of Matt Flynn and have hit on several first-round picks in the past few years. Because of that, they are on the short list of teams capable of winning a Super Bowl. 
Your blueprint for success 
would have been great in the 1970s. But in today’s game, teams win with elite quarterbacks and playmakers at the skill positions. You can get by with a shoddy of-fensive line if the rest of your tal-ent is strong enough.
Harvin brings that type of 
play-making ability. Besides, when was the last time Urban Meyer mentioned Pouncey to land another five-star recruit?

END OF GREGULATION
  If you’ve read just about anything I’ve 
written during my four years with alli-gatorSports, you’re probably expecting 
a lot of numbers in this space. 
  I hate to disappoint, but I have just one: 
This will be the 471st and ﬁ  nal time my name appears in a byline, podcast or video show for the Alligator. 
  Most of those have been packed with 
references to KenPom, cfbstats.com and even a few metrics I made up on the ﬂ  y. 
  My appreciation for the numbers isn’t as 
simple as the cliché that they never lie. 
  In reality, numbers are the only things 
that keep me sane. They’re the key to my conﬁ  dence, to me being myself and to no longer spending all my time worrying about what other people think. 
  When I was a freshman at UF, I played 
a LOT of online poker. After a high school career in Connecticut agonizing about what was “cool” and how I was viewed, I got to come to UF and be alone. At the end of my freshman year, I only knew the names of maybe a dozen non-athletes. And I absolutely loved it. I still had all my friends from back home, but down here no-body was watching. I could do whatever I wanted. 
  For a time that meant at least 40 hours 
each week of poker, not counting the class periods surﬁ  ng Two Plus Two and crunch-ing hand histories on PokerStove. 
  I haven’t found anything more mentally 
stimulating than getting inside a person’s brain and ﬁ  nding a way to always be one step ahead. The game works the way life should: You get a set of rules that every-one has to play by, and you work to master them and develop a style that allows you to acquire equity and ultimately be the best you can be. 
  More than that, poker taught me the 
most valuable lesson I’ve ever learned: You can do everything right and still fail, and you have to accept that. 
  You can make perfect move after perfect 
move after perfect move for seven or eight hours, and if you’re lucky you’ll get every-thing in the middle as a 56 percent favorite. Then there’s the times you do everything right and the other guy just happens to have aces. Or the times you get it in ahead, the dealer brings an unlucky turn and you lose anyway. 
  Sounds pretty depressing, right? I mean, 
why bother to do things the right way if all of life is just a game of chance? 
  To me, the difference between winners 
and losers — in poker and in the real world — is that desire and willingness to scratch and claw to make sure the chance of suc-cess is 56 percent instead of 53. That extra three percent doesn’t reﬂ  ect in the quality of everyday life, and the vast majority of the time it’s completely invisible. But I have enough faith in the numbers to believe it’ll bear itself out in the long run. 
  In the meantime, I can take comfort in the 
fact that I’m always doing everything I can to give myself the best chance to succeed at whatever I’m trying to do, and that I’m be-ing true to myself within that process. With a genuine belief in that system, everything that goes wrong in life is pretty easy to deal with. It’s just variance. Bad luck. 
  That being said, 
I refuse to sit here at age 22 and pre-tend for a second 
that I’ve ﬁ  gured out the “right” way to live. I’m in no position to give advice. I’m just trying to learn something new and get a little bit better every day. 
  But that faith in the odds has gotten me 
through every bit of adversity I’ve faced in a relatively cushy life.   
  When a girl doesn’t want to go out with 
me, I shake it off. When is a shot like that any better than 30 or 40 percent anyway? 
  When my best friend decided to become 
a stranger without warning, it was a bad break. I still approach friendship the same way I always have, and I’m still there for anyone who needs me. 
  But enough about the bad. I’ve also had 
some unbelievable streaks of good luck, like being given a shot at the Alligator and meeting all of the great people I’m about to thank. 
  To me, this whole student-paper-good-
bye-column thing makes about as much sense as a recently called-up Triple-A play-er doing a press conference to say a teary and heartfelt farewell to the International League. But if I’m given space to thank all the people who put me where I am today and made life worth it, I’m going to take advantage. 
  Thanks to Phil Kegler, Kyle Maistri and 
Bobby Callovi for hiring me and giving me a chance back in Fall 2009. 
  To Adam Berry for showing me the ropes 
and, as recently as yesterday, making some of the best edits you’ll ﬁ  nd anywhere. 
  To Chiang, Tyler, Tom, Watts, Boothe, 
Joe and Phil for editing my stuff despite a blatant lack of regard for inch counts. (This column is already longer than it should be.) 
  To Corey, Fink and the rest of the copy 
staff for putting up with my ridiculous numbers. 
  To my parents for giving me every op-
portunity I could ever dream of, to my boys from Connecticut for keeping it a place I can call home, and to Katie for indulging my obsession with Hayley Williams. 
  To my roommates at The Stables, who 
are always good for some BSing and will at least pretend to care when I theorize about beer pong advanced metrics. (I still contend that shooting percentage on shots that hit plastic, like batting average on balls in play for baseball, will normalize to a certain ﬁ  g-ure based on your shooting form.)
  To stats for making my life possible, 
even as I all but abandon poker and prob-ability to pursue a career with words. 
  And to any of you who made it through 
my long-winded, usually stat-packed ram-blings one ﬁ  nal time.
After four long years, this truly is the 
End of Gregulation.

Former Gator Lerentee 
McCray has his sights set on playing in the NFL and supporting his family.See story, page 28.MLB Gators
Los Angeles Dodgers second baseman Mark Ellis ﬁ  nished 4 for 5 with two home runs and four RBI in a 7-2 win against the New York Mets on Tuesday.
  ADAM PINCUS 
 Alligator Staff Writer
  USF pitcher Mike Clarkson had a night 
he’d like to forget. After the right-hander held 
Florida to two hits through the ﬁ  rst four in-nings, the Gators sent 10 batters to the plate and scored six runs on ﬁ  ve hits in the ﬁ  fth en route to a 12-1 victory on Tuesday night at McKethan Stadium.
  Connor Mitchell started the offensive out-
burst with a one-out single into right ﬁ  eld. Harrison Bader advanced him to third on a hit-and-run single in between ﬁ  rst and sec-ond base. A Richie Martin RBI single up the middle and a wild pitch scored two runs, giv-
ing Florida (23-19) its ﬁ  rst lead against South Florida (26-15).
  The Gators didn’t 
look back. The ﬁ  fth inning was Florida’s fourth frame this season with six or more runs. The previous two occurrences — six runs against Duke on Feb. 17, eight runs against Mississip-pi State on April 7 and 10 runs against South Carolina on April 13 — both led to wins. The Bulls used three pitchers in the inning.
  “We were a little bit dead up there the ﬁ  rst 
part of the game,” catcher Taylor Gushue said. “That inning was huge. I think it put us over the hump.”
  Right-hander Ryan Harris entered the 
game in the top of the sixth with runners on second and third and no outs. His ﬁ  rst pitch hit the batter in the upper back. 
  Then, he went to work. Harris, whose fast-
ball clocks in as high as 94 miles per hour, re-tired the next three batters with two strikeouts and a lineout to Bader in left ﬁ  eld.
  “[My fastball] has been my go-to (pitch) 
all year,” Harris said. “I’ve been throwing it pretty well. I didn’t have my best command today, but I can miss around the zone a little bit. Sometimes it doesn’t bite me.”
  Harris handed the ball to O’Sullivan as he walked off the mound after recording the ﬁ  rst two outs in the top of the seventh. Before stepping foot on the inﬁ  eld grass, he ﬂ  ashed a smile to Gushue. The right-hander had a good reason to be happy. 
  “Ryan has been a bull this whole season,” 
Martin said. “He’s real key to our bullpen. That’s one of the things the coaches stress a lot is rebound runs, so we try our hardest to not let any runs score after we score.”
  Florida added to its lead with four runs in 
the sixth. Martin, who entered the game with seven RBI, drove in four runners on Tuesday, including three on a sixth-inning triple.
  South Florida failed to capitalize again in 
the eighth, when the Bulls put runners on sec-ond and third with no outs.
  Although the Gators failed to put a runner on second base until the ﬁ  fth, they ﬁ  nished the game 8 for 9 with runners in scoring position.
  “You just want to get a good pitch. It doesn’t 
have to necessarily be a strike,” Gushue said. “You want to be aggressive and put the ball in play. That’s all you want to do in that situ-ation.”

Florida celebrates during a 4-0 win against Ole Miss on March 31 at McKethan Stadium. With Tuesday night’s 12-1 victory 
against USF at McKethan Stadium, UF has won eight of its past nine contests.
THE RALLY
  The NFL Draft begins Thursday night at Radio City Music 
Hall in New York, and former Gators Sharrif Floyd and Matt Elam could both hear their names called on the ﬁ  rst night. 
Nine Florida players have been selected in the ﬁ  rst round since 2003. alligatorSports staff writers Adam Pincus and Phillip Heilman de-bate which former Gator has enjoyed the best NFL career so far.
  Adam: As I write this sentence, a navy, orange and white 
No. 15 Denver Broncos jersey collects dust in my closet. I’m tempted to take the guy who left a year before I arrived on campus, and the quarterback with the statue at Ben Hill Grif-ﬁ  n and the math on his eye black. Instead I’m channeling my inner Jeff Ireland and going offensive lineman. It may be a bore, but center Maurkice Pouncey has been the best UF ﬁ  rst-rounder in the past 10 years since getting drafted by the Pitts-burgh Steelers with the 18th pick in 2010.
  Pouncey has started all but three regular season games 
in his three seasons with the Terrible Towels. He made three straight Pro Bowls and earned First Team All-Pro honors in 2011. He also helped Pittsburgh reach Super Bowl XLV in 2011. Whenever he comes back to Gainesville, he and his brother Mike throw parties at the Vault Night Club. Who wouldn’t want to pick this guy? #turntup
  Phil: Let me start by saying I am glad 
you decided against the sentimental Tebow choice. This would have gotten uglier than some of the girls you try to take home from Midtown.
  Choosing Pouncey makes more 
sense. He has been the rock in the middle of the Steelers’ of-fensive line since his rookie season. The problem? Pittsburgh is consistently among the worst offensive lines in football.
  The Steelers averaged just 3.7 yards per carry on the ground 
last season. Even Mike Pouncey and your lowly Dolphins had better production than that. When Ben Roethlisberger isn’t out due to injury, he is one of the most sacked quarterbacks in the NFL. Pouncey isn’t to blame, but it proves how little value one strong lineman has. He just can’t do it alone.
  The clear answer is Percy Harvin, the 2009 NFL Rookie of 
the Year and a Pro Bowl and All-Pro selection that same sea-son. Before an ankle injury knocked him out for the second half of last season, he was one of the most productive players in the NFL. His versatility allows for him to ﬁ  ll a number of roles, shown by him scoring rushing, receiving and kick-return touchdowns in only nine games last season.
  I know you of all people appreciate a 
man that can score multiple ways.
  Adam: Not sure if that last line was a backhanded compli-
ment or an insult. Anyway, I’m all about versatility, but if I’m committing millions of dollars to a player, I better be sure he stays on the ﬁ  eld. Harvin has had more migraines than my menopausal mother. He told NBCSports.com recently that he hasn’t had one in two years after being diagnosed with sleep apnea. Really? Since coming into the league in 2009, the re-ceiver has missed 10 games.
Which Gators ﬁ  rst-round NFL draft pick in past 10 years is best?

Before becoming an O’Connell Center sta-
ple with thousands of Rowdy Reptiles cheer-
ing his name, Ron “Moose” Davis was just a teacher on his way home from swim practice. 
His tenure as the Speedo-waving, moose-
hat-wearing Florida basketball fixture began in 1988. At age 46, Davis was training for the FINA World Masters Championships. He swam laps in the O’Connell Center’s outdoor pool nearly every night. 
Davis struggles to pinpoint the game when 
it all began, but he believes it was UF’s 83-76 win against Kentucky on Feb. 20, 1988.  
Back in ’88, basketball attendance and 
O’Dome security were not what they are to-day. After he was done with his laps, Davis stopped in to check out the game, carrying his swim bag into a mostly empty arena. Davis remembers taking his customary spot — first row behind the basket by the home bench, just a seat or two left of center. 
When the Wildcats stepped to the line to at-
tempt a foul shot, Davis glanced to his bag. In what he says was “just a spur of the moment thing,” he reached in, grabbed the green, still-wet Speedo and began waving it around. 
“The guy looked at it and was like, ‘What 
in the world?’” Davis recalls.  
Kentucky missed its next four foul shots. “I said, ‘If it works, you’ve got to do it.’”The tradition was born. 
             
Nearly 24 years later, everything about 
Davis and his shtick has evolved. The crowds have ballooned, a following has grown and the Speedo has changed. 
When opposing free-throw shooters step 
to the line, students yell, “Look at the Moose!” and wave cardboard cutouts of Bullwinkle. In the row behind Davis, a season-ticket holder with a New York accent shouts “Look at the Moose panties!” although Davis would point out that panties and a Speedo are very different things. He’d never want to trumpet something so racy at an event with so many children. 
“You want to try this on?” he shouts at the 
unsuspecting shooter. Usually, they ignore him. The good ones always do. But every once in a while, a younger player will give him a wink or a smile. Concentration broken. Mis-sion accomplished. 
Davis earned his undergraduate degree in 
physical education at UF in 1963, back when the Gators played at the Florida Gymnasium. He finished a master’s degree in 1964. He ulti-mately decided not to pursue a doctorate, but if he did he says he would have written his thesis on sports psychology. 
For all the spontaneity in its creation, the 
moose routine is scientific. 
Davis wears the same thing to every home 
game — jeans and a white Gators button down. In a sea of orange and blue, the contrast of the white is meant to attract attention. 
When the O’Connell Center added new 
seats last season, Davis was stuck on the op-posite side. He quickly asked to be switched back. He wasn’t comfortable on the other side. The Moose will work best if he can get to the opponent early, Davis thought. 
If Davis can coax the first miss, the real 
mind games begin. 
“You held it a little too tight, you’ve got to 
get it a little looser,” Davis shouts. “Your el-bows were out that time.”
Maybe the motion was flawed, maybe 
it wasn’t. Either way, the seeds of doubt are planted. 
“If you can break up that routine a little 
bit,” Davis says, “they’ve got a chance.”
             
Although Davis has met Florida coach Billy 
Donovan and even had him sign a basketball, the two have never discussed Davis’ role as “Moose.”
“Billy’s got enough to worry about,” Davis 
said. 
Instead, those conversations are reserved 
for Billy’s dad, William, who always gets a rise out of Davis’ antics. 
For many years, William knew Davis only 
as the guy “with the Moose head and stuff.” Then, about five years ago, William began coaching basketball at Queen of Peace, a K-8 school in Gainesville where Davis is the vol-unteer athletic director. At the next Florida game, all of the pieces fell into place. 
“When I realized it was Ron, I started to get 
a kick out of it,” William said. “I’m telling you, he’s hot stuff.”
Gainesville High tennis coach Paul Spra-
dling has season tickets for seats 3 and 4 to the left of the basket — the two directly next to Da-vis’ post. Davis and his wife of 45 years, Alicia, are actually ticketed for Row 10, but Spradling always lets Davis slide down for the first half. Seats 1 and 2 behind the basket rarely ever sell. Seeing around the hoop structure is nearly im-possible. No one ever fusses about Davis snag-ging those seats and doing his routine. WEDNESDAY, APRIL 24, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 27

When they arrived at Union Correctional 
Institution after an 85-mile drive from their 
home in Ocala, Lerentee McCray and his mother, Sybil, were met by a gaunt figure.  
Lerentee remembered his older brother 
as a 5-foot-11, 195-pound athletic freak. The Florida Department of Corrections now lists Leonardo Simpkins at just 143 pounds, a dra-matic weight loss brought on by a fear that the guards are trying to poison him. 
Lerentee said he brought Simpkins more 
than $150 worth of food. As the family spoke through the glass and bars that divided them, Lerentee and Sybil watched Simpkins eat in comfort. 
That day, Lerentee could only provide gro-
ceries. This time next week, he may be able to provide much more, and not just for Simp-kins.  
The 2013 NFL Draft begins on Thursday, 
and many projections have Lerentee as a late-round selection. A chance to play in the NFL would mark a new peak in Lerentee’s football career — a journey that has always been geared toward someday providing for his family. 
For a father who was deported to Jamaica 
when Lerentee was in elementary school. 
For a single mother who provided for Ler-
entee and his two brothers. 
And for a brother who is in the midst of a 
29-year sentence for crimes Lerentee and Sybil believe he didn’t commit. 
“I really think he was falsely convicted,” 
Lerentee said. “When I get money, I’ll be able to get him a lawyer and get him an appeal.”
Simpkins is currently in Close Manage-
ment I — the strictest classification Florida offers inmates. He earned it as a result of an assault on a staff member. He lives alone in a single cell. The Florida Department of Cor-rections has labeled him an “extreme security and management risk.” 
The family’s first visit in more than a year 
is the result of a mistake by the Florida De-partment of Corrections. Under the terms of his sentence, Simpkins isn’t allowed any visi-tors until Sept. 8. He can be contacted only by phone or by letter. 
During the three months following the 
2012 Florida football season, Lerentee said he wrote his brother at least 15 times. 
The family reunion was a joyful one. For 2 
hours, the three exchanged stories and remi-nisced about old memories — times Lerentee spent working towards a dream that may be realized in just a few short days. 
“I’m pretty sure that’s been on his mind 
since he was a sophomore in high school,” said Frank Beasley, Lerentee’s coach at Ocala Dunnellon High. “There’s no doubt in my mind that this is the culmination of a lot of things for him.”              
Lerentee’s injury history alone is more ad-
versity than most players face during their col-lege careers. 
After enrolling at UF in 2008, Lerentee 
missed 11 games in 2009 with a hamstring in-jury. In 2010, he missed three games with an ankle injury. In 2011, he missed four with a pinched nerve. In 2012, he was healthy for just two games before suffering a torn rotator cuff and playing hurt the rest of the season. He also suffered a sprained ankle on Oct. 27. 
The rotator cuff required postseason sur-
gery. The procedure forced him to miss the NFL Scouting Combine, the East/West Shrine Game and Florida’s annual Pro Day. His draft stock dipped. 
After what Lerentee has been through in 
his personal life, injuries don’t faze him. 
Shortly after 8:30 a.m. on July 21, 2007 — 
the summer before Lerentee’s senior year of high school — Simpkins was arrested and charged with principal first-degree robbery with a firearm. 
Police allege that Simpkins and 16-year-old 
Chris McCallum stole less than $300 from a Pizza Hut. According to arrest reports and de-positions, Simpkins removed manager Steph-anie Crouse from her vehicle at gunpoint and forced her to attempt to open the main safe. When Crouse tried to activate the silent alarm, she remembers being jerked around and hit on the back of the head with the butt of the gun. 
Although both suspects had their faces 
covered at the time of the crime, police dogs later found Simpkins hiding shirtless in a bush about a mile from the restaurant. A man liv-ing in the area saw a figure run through his back yard around the time Simpkins would 28, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, APRIL 24, 2013

Lerentee McCray, a potential late-round selection in this week’s NFL Draft, plans to use 
his new income to help his incarcerated brother, single mother and deported father. 
The Provider: Former Gator chases NFL dream to support family
See MCCrA y, pAge 29have been fleeing. A glove and gun 
left behind had traces of Simpkins’ DNA, as did a shirt found along Simpkins’ most likely escape route. Upon returning to the crime scene, police found footprints identical to Simpkins’ black, size 11 ½ Air Jor-dans. 
McCallum’s brother, Arellis Mc-
Fatten, said he dropped Simpkins and McCallum off not far from the Pizza Hut. As a former employee, McFatten said he had given Simp-kins information about the layout of the Pizza Hut and the amount of money the business typically brings in. He said the robbery was Simp-kins’ idea. Sybil and Lerentee were in dis-
belief. In their eyes, Simpkins had always been kind and diligent. He worked at Cracker Barrel, McDon-ald’s and Sonny’s in high school, training for what he still hopes is a future as a chef. A learning disability made school a challenge, but Simp-kins had passed four of the five tests necessary to get his GED.  
When speaking to Sybil from 
prison, Simpkins asks her to look after his grandmother and call other inmates to keep them from feeling lonely. 
That he could be guilty 
of such a crime was, to them, nearly unthinkable.  
“Unbelievable,” Sybil said. “I was like, ‘No, that ain’t my child. That ain’t my baby. Y’all are lying.’”The case went to trial, and Simp-
kins was sentenced to 20 years in prison. 
Sybil and Lerentee aren’t con-
vinced. Lerentee believes Simpkins was only in the wrong place at the wrong time. McCallum said in his deposition that he came up with the plan, that Simpkins was not involved in the crime. He knew Simpkins growing up, and the man assisting in the robbery wasn’t him. It was a person by the name of Cuz, who McCallum had never met pre-viously and had no other way of identifying. 
The dog that tracked Simpkins 
had to be driven to a new location during the search.  The defense ar-gued that it could have lost the scent along the way. That Simpkins’ shoe was improperly handled. That in a restaurant with 33 shoe prints, an Air Jordan isn’t a surprising find. That the glove and shirt with DNA matching Simpkins also contained other people’s DNA. 
The family couldn’t afford a law-
yer, so Simpkins was represented by a public defender.  
“I have had lawyers tell me that 
there are different flaws in the case,” Sybil said. 
Simpkins is also serving three 
years each for fleeing police, posses-sion of cocaine and obstruction of a criminal investigation stemming from a Nov. 3, 2007 incident dur-ing which he was also charged with first-degree attempted murder with a firearm. 
Around 3 a.m., approximately 
16 shots were fired from the driver’s side of a light-colored vehicle into a group of 20 or 30 people in a resi-dential area. Several subjects sus-tained gunshot wounds and were immediately taken to the hospital. Witnesses believe the shooting was connected to a brawl at an Ocala nightclub about three miles away.
Nearly 3 and a half hours later, 
deputy Brian Haworth pulled Simp-kins over for cutting him off and driving his blue Buick 75 in a 65 mph zone. Upon approaching the vehicle, Haworth noticed a 9 mm semi-auto-matic handgun. When Haworth re-treated and ordered Simpkins to exit the car, Simpkins led Haworth on a chase for about four miles. 
The pursuit reached speeds of 
90 miles per hour before Simpkins pulled off the highway, crashed into a dump truck and drove into a ditch. Simpkins fled on foot, but Haworth tracked him down after about 75 yards. Upon apprehend-ing Simpkins, Haworth searched the area and found a revolver and a semi-automatic handgun stashed in the bushes.  
Simpkins told Haworth the in-
juries to his face were the result of an altercation at a club the previous night. He offered no further com-ments. 
When Haworth searched Simp-
kins’ vehicle, he found a small red plastic tube of cocaine and a clear plastic bag of marijuana. 
The shell casings matched those 
found at the shooting scene, and the vehicle’s rear driver’s side door tested positive for gun shot residue. The vehicle matched the one a wit-ness saw leaving the shooting, and a security guard at the nightclub iden-tified Simpkins as the man who had been attacked. 
Because the two shooting victims 
provided the police false names and were unable to identify Simpkins, and because Simpkins had already been sentenced to 20 years in prison as a result of the robbery case, the charges of attempted murder were not pursued. 
When asked about the inci-
dent, Lerentee quickly changes the subject. Those charges have been dropped, he said.
Lerentee said the drug charges 
— Simpkins was found guilty of marijuana possession twice before — could be a result of Simpkins’ friends leaving the drugs in his car. 
“He wasn’t really like a druggie,” 
Lerentee said. 
Simpkins also faced two dropped 
charges of grand theft, although Ler-entee smiles as he tells the story of Simpkins simply “borrowing” his girlfriend’s car for a few hours lon-ger than expected. When she grew impatient, she called the police. The car was returned without is-sue, and the charges were promptly dropped. 
             
As Simpkins went through trials, 
sentencing and the start of his stay in prison, Lerentee never lost focus. 
“If anything, it motivated him 
to do better,” Beasley said. “He’s always just taking care of his own business.”

Lerentee McCray’s older brother, Leonardo Simpkins, is serving a 29-year prison sentence after being found 
guilty of principal first-degree robbery with a firearm, fleeing police, possession of cocaine and obstruction of a criminal investigation. McCray and his mother, Sybil, believe Simpkins was falsely convicted.
MCCrA y, from page 28parking. While the soccer teams are able to 
use the actual athletic fields whenever they choose, the Millinoffs were told that they could use the overgrown parking area but not reserve it. 
Avery said if he allowed the area to be 
reserved, it would cease to be a general ad-mission park.
“A lot of people like to go there and 
throw a blanket there and sit and read a book under the trees,” Avery said. “Kind of more general solitude.”
Both Diamond Sports Complex and Eas-
ton Sports Complex in Newberry are op-tions for the Millinoff’s lacrosse leagues. Their middle school leagues will play at Easton this spring. However, neither has more than one field, so they aren’t condu-cive to holding tournaments for more than a small fraction of their 330 middle school kids. 
The fields are also inconvenient for chil-
dren who go to Howard Bishop and Lincoln middle schools on the east side of town.
“It’s another 20 minutes for them added 
onto that trip,” Lynn said. “For a little mid-dle school game, they’ll go, ‘Meh, not worth it. I’m just going to put my kid in soccer. It’s right here at school.’”
Benjamin, who has coached soccer at the 
club and high school levels in Gainesville for nearly two decades, has nothing against lacrosse as a sport. He sees the growth of any sport at a youth level as a process that takes time. 
Benjamin said soccer went through a 
similar process in the mid-‘90s, and it’s something the lacrosse teams will have to continue to fight through.
“Those guys have to pay their dues,” he 
said.
        
There is a possible solution to the 
Millinoffs’ problem. Making it happen is the difficult part.
According to Avery, there is no land 
owned by Alachua County that doesn’t al-ready serve some purpose. However, there are areas that could be turned into facilities to better serve youth sports.
For the county to fund such a project, the 
Millinoffs would need to show Avery proof of lacrosse’s significant, sustained growth.
“If you come up with numbers, that 
says here’s how many participants, clubs, leagues, teams, something like that would be interesting to know,” Avery said. “Be-cause that would have somewhat of an in-fluence on where this might lead.”
Avery declined to give a number of la-
crosse players there would have to be for action to be taken, but said he would ana-lyze the information once he has it to make a decision.
“It’s everybody’s taxes that need to 
be the bigger bang for their buck,” Avery said.
Avery and Benjamin both mentioned the 
Alachua County Fairgrounds as an option.
The Fairgrounds, which are 96 acres, are 
big enough to hold several playing fields, but work would have to be done. The parking lights that currently run straight through the land would need to be relo-cated to form a new parking area adjacent to the fields. 
“That land is just sitting idle,” Benjamin 
said.
“That is somewhere they could go and 
knock some trees down, level the land, put irrigation in and do something special. There are opportunities out there. Do they have the money or the will? I don’t know.”
Before the county would consider spend-
ing the money to clear the necessary trees and irrigate and level the land, it would have to receive a proposal from someone. Lynn said she and Ian are willing to talk to Avery again, and Avery said he would listen.
Until the Millinoffs find the time to ap-
proach Avery, they’ll continue to use what-ever space they have. And if nothing comes of the Fairgrounds or one of the parks that has room for improvement, lacrosse won’t get any room to grow.
“Basically, what we have is what we 
got,” Avery said. “Unless someone donates a bunch of property to us, we’re at a stand-still.”

Local lacrosse teams such as Buchholz High are hoping to find another place to play 
games in the future. One possibility is renovating the Alachua County Fairgrounds.

When 11- and 12-year-old lacrosse play-
ers run up and down the fields at Diamond 
Sports Park, Lynn Millinoff occasionally has to go from facilitator to active partici-pant. 
But she doesn’t pick up a lacrosse stick 
and join in on the action.
She goes on animal control duty.“There are some really tenacious moles 
that will literally pop up in the middle of a game,” Millinoff said. “The kids will be running along and they’ll just stop dead looking at this mole. And this mole is fear-less.”
Millinoff, 54, who facilitates local mid-
dle school lacrosse leagues and coaches the Buchholz girls lacrosse team with her hus-band, Ian, has gotten used to taking such matters into her own hands.
“We go over, we cover the hole up, get 
the rake out, stamp it down and literally — within 10 minutes — you see the dirt start to fly.”
Unfortunately for the Millinoffs, Dia-
mond Sports Park is one of the best facili-ties available to them.
In a little more than a decade, lacrosse 
grew from something that the people of Gainesville only knew as a northern sport to being a staple in local athletic programs, including a burgeoning middle school league.
However, at a time when interest is at an 
all-time high in the area, the kids are run-ning out of places to play.
“We’re bursting at the seams for field 
space,” Millinoff said. “We’re begging and borrowing.”
      
The Millinoffs want real toilets.The Gainesville Buchholz High football 
field gets too worn down between spring football practice and other sports, so the girls’ lacrosse team practices and plays at the Boys & Girls Club in Northwest Gainesville.The facility wasn’t suitable for use when 
the Bobcats began playing there.
“We repaired all the bleachers because 
you couldn’t even sit on them without fall-ing through,” Lynn said. “We give them money that they buy fertilizer and grass seed and stuff like that. We buy loads of dirt to fill in the holes.”
Still, the field at the Boys & Girls Club 
has severe divots and dips and has sev-eral patches of dirt where there should be grass.
The girls must buy a temporary member-
ship to the club to be able to use its fields, but the girls still don’t use the bathrooms in the main building. The team has to rent a Port-O-Potty. The players also don’t have easy access to a water fountain.
“I’m afraid to even say, but it’s kind of 
embarrassing when people come to play here,” said Michelle Crew, the president of the team’s booster club. “Because we go, and they have these beautiful fields, beauti-ful facilities and bathrooms. And they come here, and there is no place to change.”
The five area middle schools that form a 
league run by the Millinoffs have non-reg-ulation fields that can be used for practices but not games. They are forced to use the Boys & Girls Club when they play in tour-naments.
While they do their best to make sure 
the fields don’t get overused, holes eventu-ally form. Ian often has to fill the holes with sand.
Olivia Iobst, a sophomore who plays 
for Buchholz, isn’t quite as angered by her team’s playing conditions as her coach.
“All fields have holes,” she said. “It’s just 
some may have a few more than others.”
Nicole White, a 20-year-old UF finance 
junior from Ponte Vedra, coaches the Gainesville girls and said her players battle 
ant hills and lose balls in tall grass. Even 
more concerning: their field at Gethsemane Lutheran Church at 34th Street and 39th Street poses a safety risk.
“We’ve had girls doing a warm-up lap 
who have just rolled an ankle because there are holes,” White said. “So it’s kind of dif-ficult as a coach to tell them to not worry about that. But as a player, I know if I was running around you can’t not focus on not rolling your ankle.”
If nothing changes, the Millinoffs might 
have to find somewhere else to play middle school games next fall. Buchholz football might increase its use of the Boys & Girls Club fields for practice. The Millinoffs will also have to continue to turn away elemen-tary schoolers who want to play.
“We are exceeding capacity on every 
field we go to,” Lynn said.
Lynn dreams of a multi-million dollar 
benefactor swooping in and sponsoring a new stadium for the local lacrosse teams. One with Astroturf fields, clean bathrooms with running water and bleachers. But now that is only a wish.
“That’s the ideal situation for all of 
Gainesville because the parks, they won’t share,” Lynn said. “Soccer has locked the parks up and there is nowhere else for any-one to go.”
 
      
 
There are other fields in Gainesville that are open at times, but that does not guarantee the lacrosse teams use of them.
According to Alachua County Codes, 
any fields that were built for a sport should be used primarily for that sport. The fields that can accommodate soccer and lacrosse include Forest Park, Kanapaha Veterans Park and Squirrel Ridge Park.
The Gainesville Soccer Alliance paid 
$500,000 to construct the facilities at Jones-ville Park, so it has control over their use. Each of the other fields is primarily used by a soccer club that has to mow the grass and deal with the county to schedule the field’s alternate uses. 
As part of those agreements, the soccer 
clubs are supposed to ensure the fields are not overused.
“You can’t schedule it so heavily that it 
destroys the fields,” said Robert Avery, the Director of Parks for Alachua County for the last 28 years. “Help us, you know, give the fields time to rest, relax. And that’s dif-ficult in a public area.”
Lynn is not happy because she can’t 
convince the soccer club that schedules the use of Kanapaha Park  — Leg-A-Z Soccer Academy — to let any lacrosse teams prac-tice there.
Leg-A-Z’s coaching coordinator, Basil 
Benjamin, said his club has nothing against lacrosse, but it has already delegated its ex-tra field time to a Mexican soccer league, a flag football league and to the Gainesville Regional Soccer League.
Lynn and Ian inquired about reserving 
a non-field area of Kanapaha that consisted of overgrown grass and is often used for WEDNESDAY, APRIL 24, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 31

Buchholz High girls’ lacrosse coach“It’s like ambiance or some-
thing,” Spradling said. “It’s part of 
the atmosphere. We’ve got this cra-zy joker with a moose hat on.”
During free throws, that is. In 
normal game action, Davis stays mostly silent. He’s honed in. 
“He’s like a mortician,” Spradling 
said. “Quiet as a church mouse. When it’s time for him to stand up, he’s right up there doing it.”
When the Moose stirs, the stu-
dent section takes notice. Davis says fans — usually girls — still approach him before, during and after most games to have their picture taken next to him. At one game in the early 2000s, Davis was approached by the mother of Gators great David Lee. 
“The guys really love what you 
do out there,” she told him. 
That moment was as close as he 
ever came to hearing from a coach or player, regardless of the connection to coach Donovan’s father and wife, Christine, who keeps score for the volleyball teams at Queen of Peace. 
But Davis doesn’t need recogni-
tion — he does the Moose routine for fun. If anything, he would like for his wife to be able to meet Billy Donovan’s daughter, Hasbrouck, so the two could discuss horses.
Davis and his wife breed, raise 
and sell horses from their farm in Newberry. They own nine, with another expected to be born in the near future. They also have one in Kentucky that Alicia, who stewards competitions and has been showing horses since she was 12, will be rid-ing in competition this week. 
Hasbrouck is attending Auburn 
on an equestrian scholarship. 
“She’s a horse person, and my 
wife is a horse person,” Davis said. “Getting those two together would be interesting.”

Before the Moose was unleashed 
on the Southeastern Conference, an airport in Alaska had the first view. 
Davis and his wife were there on 
vacation sometime in the mid-90s, and Davis wanted to pick up a gift for his son, Christopher. 
The plush moose hat was perfect. 
The small central dome was col-ored the deep brown of moose fur. Small, tan, pillowy antlers stuck out from the sides. The hat was hardly bulky — Davis neatly tucks it away between foul shots — but it was still too large to be packed in his stuffed airplane luggage. So Davis did the only logical thing: He wore it around the airport. 
“I see people turning their heads 
looking like, ‘What in the world?’” Davis said. “And I said, ‘You know what? This might work at the bas-ketball game.’”
The Speedo changed through 
the years — the current model is too small for him to ever wear, just something used he bought — but the hat has remained constant.  
While consistent with the profile 
of a superfan, Davis sheepishly ad-mits his attendance record is far from spotless. Just last year he missed a game to go snowmobiling with his family in West Yellowstone.  
He also misses most of the road 
games, instead just pacing his living room as he watches on TV. 
“If it’s a close game, I walk more,” Davis said. 
No need for any silly supersti-
tions or traditions. “I can’t affect the game,” Davis said. 
His only prop is a Velcro referee 
doll with a plastic yellow whistle and removable head and limbs. Ali-cia bought it for him, hoping to give him a healthy way to let off his frus-trations. If something doesn’t go his way, Davis has been known to send the head careening across the room.
“It doesn’t hurt the TV,” Davis 
said. 
             
During his 28 years as a high school swim coach, Davis worked with many different programs around Florida. His team at Gainesville High was one of the first to test an invention called Gato-rade, and he got the Gainesville East Side program off the ground with a squad of just four boys and one girl. 
He ultimately coached about 
eight All-Americans. 
After more than 36 years teach-
ing physical education at public schools, Davis grew fed up with the class sizes, retired and started at Queen of Peace. His hours are flex-ible, he runs things his way, and he doesn’t have to go to any meetings he doesn’t want to. From a cluttered office barely more than 8 feet by 8 feet at the corner of the gym, Davis handles scheduling and makes sure all of the little details are taken care of — every event has a trash can and somebody to handle concessions.  
He still does Masters swimming, 
although the intensity has dropped from 1988. That year he traveled to Brisbane, Australia, for the champi-onships, medaling as a first-timer at water polo and taking on a grueling swim schedule that culminated in a 13th-place finish in the 200-meter breast stroke, his best event. 
His swims today are more casual 
and infrequent, but even at age 71 he doesn’t intend to stop anytime soon. “I want to swim in that 100-plus age group,” he said. 
In the meantime, he’s still around 
Queen of Peace, keeping the athletics in order. But only in the afternoon — in the morning he and his wife feed the horses and clean out their stalls.  
And, of course, he’s still going 
to basketball games, which he’s at-tended almost religiously since the O’Connell Center opened in 1980. Always behind the basket, always with the Speedo and moose hat. 
“The students expect it, so I al-
most have to be there,” Davis said. “If I get one foul shot missed, it may not be because of the moose, but they think it is. And I think it is.”

Florida basketball superfan Ron Davis has been a season ticket holder since the O’Connell Center 
opened in 1980. Although ticketed for Row 10, Davis always moves down to the first row behind the basket, where he is warmly received by the Rowdy Reptiles and other Gators fans.
