Foreign-policy
scholar speaks
By JOEY FLECHAS
Alligator Writer
International relations scholar
John Mearsheimer talked about the
political lobby for Israel and its ef-
fect on U.S. foreign policy during a
speech Wednesday night that drew
a crowd of more than 100 people to
Ustler Hall.
The speech was sponsored by
Human Rights Awareness on Cam-
pus.
Mearsheimer, a University of
Chicago professor, said the Ameri-
can Israel Public Affair Committee,
along with its partners that make up
the Israel lobby, have tremendous
power over Congress and the presi-
dent.
This power, he explained, has
prevented the U.S. government
from pressuring Israel to form more
fair and peaceful relations with Pal-estinians.
"President Obama is not going
to be able to push Israel into a two-
state solution," he said.
Mearsheimer said finding a way
to form two independent states for
Isrealis and Palestinians is the best
course of action for both the U.S. and
Israel because the
alternative would
be an apartheid
state where Pales-
tinians are more
severely op-
pressed.
Political sci-
Mearsheimer encejuniorJoshua
Villanueva said afterward he appre-
ciated Mearsheimer's viewpoints.
"I'm more convinced of the two-
state solution than I was before,"
Villanueva said.
Mearsheimer was paid $5,000 to
speak.10

SPECIAL REPORT
Candidate faces attack ads
ByCJ PRUNER
Alligator Staff Writer
Long before he was a window
cleaner and Gainesville mayor
candidate, Don Marsh played
chess.
The key to being a good player,
he said, is having the discipline to
play the board instead of the op-
ponent, and the same applies to
the campaign trail for Gainesville
mayor.
For Marsh, this election cy-
cle has been one grueling game
against a tough and seasoned op-
ponent, City Commissioner Craig
Lowe.
As the two prepare to face off
once more in an April run-offelection, both candidates empha-
sized the importance of sticking
to the issues instead of resorting
to political mudslinging.
"There's no reason for it."
Craig Lowe
Gainesville mayor candidate
But for Lowe, this campaign
season has been plagued by
people whom he describes as
"want[ing] to drive a wedge in
the political community."
Despite his pledge to focus
squarely on the issues, Lowe has
faced a slew of personal attacks,
mostly pertaining to his sexual
orientation."None of this would come
up without the attacks," he said.
"There's no reason for it."
One of the most prominent ex-
amples were fliers that were dis-
tributed across the city that said
Lowe was responsible for allow-
ing men in women's restrooms.
The fliers claimed to be spon-
sored by "concerned citizens of
Gainesville."
Another flier attempted to
mimic one flier from his cam-
paign. The pink flier mockingly
advocated for the support of a
gay agenda."

City to get snazzy bus line
By CRISTINA RABAZA
Alligator Contributing Writer
Before the semester's end, students taking
bus trips from Gainesville will be able to sit back
-or lie down -and enjoy the ride.
RedCoach, the newest long-distance bus line
coming to Gainesville, features 27 leather "bed-
seats" per bus along with flat-screen TVs, wire-
less Internet and vending machines.
The date the buses will start traveling to and
from Gainesville has not been released.
Depending on the departure and arrival lo-
cations, one-way ticket prices will range from
$45 to $165, and two-way prices will range from
$81 to $297. RedCoach will transport students,
families and businesspeople to and from six lo-
cations across the state, as well as to and from
Atlanta.
Traditional long-distance buses have be-
tween 48 and 54 upright seats. Gatorbus, GMG
Transports, Miami Bus Service and American
E-Tours all make trips to and from Gainesville.
They charge between $20 and $65 for a one-way
ticket and between $40 and $80 for a round trip.
"Instead of being able to sell many seats for
more money, we remodeled the layout of the
bus for ultimate comfort," said RedCoach ad-
ministrative assistant Maria Piva.Todd Morrone, coordinator for risk man-
agement at UF's Department of Environmental
Health & Safety, said giving people so many
comfortable features is consistent with good er-
gonomic thinking, which involves fitting an en-
vironment to the individual, rather than fitting
the individual to the environment.
"Instead of being able to sell many
seats for more money, we remodeled
the layout of the bus for ultimate
comfort."
Maria Piva
Red Coach administrative assistant
Despite these luxuries, Silvana Vargas, a civil
engineering junior, said she would not take a
RedCoach bus because she cannot afford the
line's prices.
Vargas said she usually takes a bus from
Gainesville to South Florida about four times
each semester and looks for the cheapest alter-
native.
"It's not great not having the leg space, the
comfort and all the added features for that
whole distance, but I don't have the money to
spend for that luxury," Vargas said.City to make over park
By VICTORIA ISRAELS
Alligator Contributing Writer
The City of Gainesville's Possum
Creek Park is getting a makeover.
The park, located at 4009 NW
53rd Ave., is temporarily closed to
the public for park improvements,
and for safety reasons, it will remain
closed until the renovations are com-
plete.
The renovations include the con-
struction of a dog park and a skate
park.
Plans also include expanding and
paving the parking lot and installing
new fences enclosing the park.
Several community meetings
were held to determine what local
residents wanted, and these renova-
tions were at the top of the list, said
Bob Woods, city spokesman.
The total construction cost is
about $800,000, and the renovations
were funded by Florida RecreationDevelopment Assistance Program,
the city's Capital Improvement Pro-
gram, and a Wild Spaces -Public
Places sales tax referendum.
The Wild Spaces -Public Places
referendum is a one-half cent sales
tax that started in January 2009 and
runs until December 2010.
The organization, a citizen-led
effort to protect natural resources
and improve publicLocal recreational facilities
News in Alachua County,
projected the tax will
raise $40 million.
"We want to give the greatest re-
turn on the taxpayers' money at Pos-
sum Park," Woods said.
Park visitors are encouraged
to visit San Felasco Park, 6400 NW
43rd Way, while Possum Creek Park
is under construction. San Felasco
Park features hiking trails, a picnic
shelter and playground equipment.
The park is scheduled to reopen
by the end of April.

RTS gets biodiesel grant
By EDEN JOYNER
Alligator Contributing Writer
The Gator Nation just got a little bit
greener.
Gainesville's Regional Transit Sys-
tem will receive a $99,500 grant from the
Florida Department of Transportation
for its eco-friendly biodiesel program,
according to department spokesman
Philip Worth.
The state agency offers annual service
projects to transit systems in Florida, and
RTS applied for the grant as a biodiesel
alternative fuel transit program.
The grant requires Gainesville to
match the money through a contract pro-
cess. After the city matches the $99,500
grant, the Florida Department of Trans-
portation will give its 50-percent share,
Worth said.
Chip Skinner, spokesman for RTS,
said the money is already in the transitsystem's budget and city officials are
waiting for paperwork to be finalized.
Currently all buses with a route on
campus use biodiesel, accounting for 22
percent of the fleet, Skinner said.
The grant will allow RTS to use biod-
iesel fuel in the entire 105-bus fleet.
The buses running on the fuel are la-
beled with a decal saying that the bus is
"Greening the Gator Na-
Local tion," according to the City
News of Gainesville's Web site.
He said he thinks the
entire fleet will be converted to biodiesel
by the end of the year.
Skinner said the project helps RTS
reduce carbon dioxide emissions and de-
crease its dependency on oil.
The project has an estimated cost of
$398,000 over a 2-year period.
The cost will cover new fuel tanks en-
gineered to dispense the fuel along with
the existing vehicle adaptations, he said.SPECIAL REPORT
UPD cites SG president
for disorderly conduct
By KATHERINE BEIN
Alligator Writer
UF Student Body President Jordan
Johnson was cited for disorderly conduct
by the University Police Department after
demanding a SNAP ride to his off-campus
home at about 1:45 a.m. Saturday.
According to the report:
Officers responded to a call from two
SNAP employees whose van was parked
on Museum Road near Beaty Towers. When
the officers arrived, Johnson was shaky on
his feet, and officers called for him to stop.
As they approached, they could smell alco-
hol on his breath.
An officer placed Johnson in handcuffs
to keep him from making a scene.
When asked to identify himself, Johnson
said, "You know who I am.
When asked again, he said he was the
Student Body president.
When SNAP employees Aljahra Lewis
and Kendal Orgera refused to take John-
son and girlfriend Erica Rakow to his off-campus apartment, Johnson got angry and
pointed out that, as president, he funded
SNAP and used it to get home frequently.
After continued refusal, Johnson said
"Student Government should pull its fund-
ing from this [unknown expletive] pro-
gram."
During the interview,
Johnson mentioned that
UPD was a bad agency
for their involvement in
S the recent shooting of an
international graduate
student.
Johnson Johnson said Tues-
day he had no comment
about the incident.
Huntley Johnson, Jordan Johnson's law-
yer, who has represented 23 Gators football
players, said Jordan Johnson realizes he
made a mistake.
According to Huntley Johnson, Jordan
Johnson said if he could redo that evening,
he would do things much differently, add-
ing Jordan Johnson is taking steps to ensure
something like this doesn't happen again.

Wednesday was Kick Butts
Day, a national event encourag-
ing students to speak up against
tobacco use.
A new smoking policy ban-
ning tobacco use on UF's campus
will not take effect until July 1.
Because the new policy is not
a law, UF spokesman Steve Or-
lando said students and faculty
will police each other to ensure
the rule is followed.
"If smoking on campus is
a problem, it's because
the university hasn't been
fair about accommodating
smokers."

The policy is part of a cultural
change on campus that involves
a shift toward a more negative
view of smoking, Orlando said.
"No one wants to be an out-
cast," he said.
The policy hopes to do more
than just eliminate smoking.Max Reed / Alligator Staff

pus, and she hopes the campus-
wide policy will go well too, Ross
said.
Those who do not follow the
new tobacco policy could be pun-
ished.
Orlando said student smok-
ers who repeatedly violate the
policy could face punishment by
the Student Conduct and Conflict
Resolution.
Faculty and staff who smoke
could also be affected by the
amount of time they take to walk
off campus to smoke.
Statistics professor Yasar Ye-
silcay smokes outside Griffin-
Floyd Hall every day. He said he
would have no problem smoking
off campus after July 1.
"Smoking has been banned
elsewhere," Yesilcay said. "And I
can't see why it couldn't be done
here."
Art King, an electrical engi-
neering junior, smokes between
classes and said he thinks ban-
ning tobacco from campus is un-
fair.
"If smoking on campus is a
problem, it's because the univer-
sity hasn't been fair about accom-
modating smokers," King said.

Student groups meet,
discuss hate speech
By ANDREW WYZAN
Alligator Contributing Writer
Students, faculty and adminis-
tration came together Wednesday
night during Turlington Turmoil, an
open discussion of the acts of intol-
erance that have occurred on cam-
pus in recent weeks.
About 50 people participated
in the discussion, which was spon-
sored by the Division of Student
Affairs in cooperation with several
organizations, including the Center
for Student Activities and Involve-
ment, Student Government, Islam
on Campus, the Pakistani Student
Association and Pride Student
Union.
"Part of the reason we're here
tonight is concerning some of the
issues that have occurred in Turl-
ington Plaza," said Paige Crandall,
associate dean of students.
Crandall said the event was orga-
nized in response to the SG fliers as-
sociating the Student Alliance party
with the Nazi Party and in response
to the Dove World Outreach Center
speakers who wear "Islam is of the
devil" shirts.
Demetri Morgan, a political sci-
ence junior, said he remembers
being a freshman and seeing the
heated debates and appreciating thedialogue in Turlington.
"In recent years, I feel it's got-
ten worse and become more about
pushing views upon people," Mor-
gan said.
Chris Loschiavo, assistant deanof
students, said the administration is
limited in what it can do in response
to what people say on campus.
It can only intervene on acts that
constitute a true threat, such as a
threat to someone's life, Loschiavo
said.
Ten years ago, the university
tried adopting
specific hate
speech codes,
but they were all

how they can
have more civil discussions about
controversial issues on campus.

cluded holding an open forum on
Turlington Plaza once a month that
focuses on the current issues talked
about on campus.
Crandall said she appreciated the
array of ideas.

have change occur," she said.Aundre Larrow / Alligator

Filthy Facebook
UK study relates
Facebook to syphilisStudents don't need another reason to feel bad for lurk-
ing on Facebook, but UK officials just added one more
to the growing list.
According to the Brits, the social networking site led to a
rise in syphilis cases -in areas across the pond, at least.
The staff of the public health center in Teesside found that
more time Facebook users spent sifting through profile pages
and writing on other people's walls translated into more ca-
sual sex partners.
That jump, in turn, led to a four-fold increase in reported
cases of syphilis. And then there's the unreported ones.
Although studies have shown people are more likely
to engage in risky sexual behavior with partners found on
the Internet, officials are glossing over the most important
point.
More people are deciding against wearing condoms.
Isn't that choice the larger problem for the British?
With this report, health-service workers are looking to tar-
get a Web site instead of the ignorant choices of the public.
Experts seem ready to blame nearly any social ill on the
realm of social networking.
However, Facebook is only an enabler for people making
bad choices in the first place. What users choose to do off the
computer is still their decision.
That is assuming, of course, that everyone logs out in or-
der to hook up.
And nowadays, even that's not a certainty.
The 'C' Word
We cannot even be-gin to imagine why
anyone would shill
want to listen to Ann Coulter.
But after canceling her ap-
pearance for Tuesday night
at the University of Ottawa,
Coulter called herself a hate
crime victim, and now we're
all listening again.
Coulter was scheduled
for her appearance by the
Campus Conservatives and
was outraged when Francois
Houle, the university vice
president, e-mailed her and
told her to be careful with
what she said.
"Promoting hatred against
any identifiable group would
not only be considered inap-
propriate, but could in fact
lead to criminal charges," he
wrote.
When students created an
anti-Coulter Facebook group
and began protesting her
presence on campus, Coulter
canceled the speech herself,
apparently over fears for her
safety.
After lashing out against
Muslims, Canadians, liber-
als, the LGBT communityand whomever else she could
blame, she threatened to pre-
pare a human rights com-
plaint and blamed Houle's
e-mail for stirring up the stu-
dents' anger.
What canwe say? Coulter's
remarks may come from pure
narcissism or lack of historical
knowledge, but last time we
checked, in order to call your-
self a victim of a hate crime,
there has to be an actual crime.
Yet she was given a stage and
she took it to extremes again.
Coulter is trying to put
herself in a category with
people who have been beaten,
robbed, harassed or killed
for who they are after she re-
ceived a warning e-mail and
faced a group protest.
We're disgusted by her ac-
tions. She has always been a
fan of dishing out the hate but
can't seem to take even a little
opposition.
One good thing can come
from this, though: Hopefully,
it will cause more people to
turn off the TV when her face
appears, and her nasty re-
marks may, for once, fall on
deaf ears.

Health care bill targets tattoos with tax
ne of the best parts of the latest fad in Americanfederal legislating is how the actual content of
our billion-dollar bills remain completely secret
until after they are signed into law. It's like a scratch-off
lottery ticket, and who doesn't love the excitement and
anticipation of scratch-offs?
Scratch-off Congress has passed a couple bank wel-
fare bills in this manner, but in its defense, shoving hard-
earned money into the hands of people associated with
banks is historically what America does best. The coolly
disinterested latex caress of a disgruntled doctor, though,
is something much more tangible to the average citizen
than a bailout-funded banker orgy aboard a yacht made
of diamonds.
Because of this disconnect, one of the most popular
American pastimes of the next few months will certainly
be getting completely freaked out about different parts of
the health care bill that passed this week. As a public ser-
vice I would like to take this opportunity to do my part.
While in line at KFC last night, a woman in front of me
was discussing how she heard from a friend who heard
it on talk radio that Obama was gonna start taxing tan-
ning booths and tattoo parlors. I had heard about the tax
on tanning, but was surprised to hear about the tattoo
tax. As it turns out, I am not alone in my astonishment
regarding this most unorthodox tax.
According to the Internet, Sandra Bullock waved her
shiny new Oscar like a magic wand and had extreme
anti-tattoo provisions written into the humongous health
care bill. Some message boards and blogs even suggest
that the Americans with Disabilities Act will be amended
to include a designation for people wronged in some
way by excessively inked individuals -but the federalU'
Tommy Maple
letters@alligator orgcourts have to this point stopped
short of granting Bullock a license
for legally hunting skanky tattooed
whores.
Genetic testing of each citizen
enrolled in the national health care
database will track people with
tattoos for certain ethnic markers,
and people with specific tats and
no genetic-based cultural signification in their family
background will be subject to an extra tax on their in-
come. This bylaw, dubbed the Frat Tax, will allow the
federal government to make sure that your tribal tattoo
corresponds with a tribe your family actually belonged
to, and make sure that the Kanji or Sanskrit word on your
shoulder could have conceivably slipped from the mouth
of your long-dead ancestors.
The most heinous of the new anti-tat measures, direct-
ed at hipsters with whole bodies of colorful ink, plans
to use a dispassionate board of seven peers to examine
the whole of a person's tattoo collection and decide how
much extra tax they will pay based on the continuity of
the whole design. Known derisively by some as a "Koi
Panel," these independent reviews could be the differ-
ence between affording that next sweet indie band tee
and sadly schlepping home from the show listening to
Animal Collective sans T-shirt.
Call your congressperson as soon as you put this col-
umn down and tell them the health care bill needs to be
stopped. I would, too, but I just went and bought these
scratch-offs, and I'm gonna be busy for a while.

Health bill will lead to entitlement
I find Will Penman's Wednesday column
urging conservatives to move on absurd. If
you, Will, are going to write against your ideo-
logical archrivals, please make some attempt
to understand them. May I do some explain-
ing?
The health care bill itself clearly is not go-
ing to cause the downfall of America. Instead,
America's downfall will be due to a much
longer-running, further-reaching issue: a
creeping sense of entitlement. We the people
seem to believe more and more that everyone
is entitled to this and that whether they care to
work for it or not.
If this trend is not halted, it will cause
America's downfall. Our nation will not cease
to exist but will simply fall into mediocrity.
I believe in American exceptionalism. I be-
lieve that America is -or recently was -the
best country on Earth. I would like to continue
this belief. I would like to remain proud that I
am an American.
Will, maybe you disagree with American
exceptionalism. Maybe you think America
should be just like the European countries
you mention. Maybe you think a sense of
entitlement will not decrease personal respon-
sibility and vigor. There are plenty of opportu-
nities for you and me to respectfully disagree.
Brash vilification based on a friend's Facebook
status is not one of them.

Raise Bright Futures standards
Look at what has been on American televi-
sion and what has been popular in American
music for the past decade. Look at the coun-
tries that have been the most innovative in
mathematics and physics for the past two de-
cades; America is no longer one of them. Look
at the American manufacturing machine and
how it has been struggling for the past three
decades. The list can go on.
Without argument, American exceptional-
ism is on the decline. Keeping Bright Futures
at what, quite frankly, is a pathetic standard
directly contributes to this decline because it
rewards mediocrity. It conditions our culture
to think it is entitled to free handouts. True,
there is an education gap in our public schoolsystem. It is unfortunate that minority students
often do not have the same resources available
to them as their white peers. However, keep-
ing Bright Futures without integrity in order
to allow more unqualified students a free ride
to college is just a Band-Aid solution, short-
sighted and without promise. How nitwitted
of the Alligator to think that the Bright Futures
standards should remain where they are.

Columnist 'too objective'
Matthew Christ: To which political party
do you belong? I couldn't tell after reading
yesterday's column. Maybe if you had spent
a few words glorifying one of the two par-
ties, I could have figured it out. Perhaps some
shameless, ruthless bashing of all things re-
lated to your political opposition would have
helped. I turn to the opinions section of the Al-
ligator to see stubborn opining, not acceptance
and compromise.
Still, it was pleasing to note that your refer-
ences to Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck, and the
entirety of the GOP weren't hypocritical at all.
I sincerely appreciate the obvious efforts you
made to deter further polarization betwixt the
two major political factions. It's great to see a
columnist displaying tact and open-minded-
ness in regard to politics. Thank you so much
for avoiding one-sided rhetoric in your writ-
ing.
It didn't help, though, that you objectively
accepted both the virtues and vices of the bill;
next time try to be more hateful and abstract in
your points. I, for one, would enjoy reading a
column filled with flourishes of propaganda-
style diction.
Or maybe I'm just an illiterate, unscrupu-
lous, angry, misguided, Republican buffoon.

Samberg show disappointed
OK, so Andy Samberg is funny. Unfortu-
nately, not as funny as many expected. With
a lot of the crowd leaving before he finished
making his last weird face or avoiding his
last question in a strange voice, it seemed theevent didn't quite live up to SNL dreams. The
Q-and-A setup might have been rather inter-
esting -I am personally addicted to "Inside
the Actors Studio" -if Andy had actually
answered a majority of the questions. His at-
titude, dress and request that no pictures be
taken (what am I supposed to do with all that
empty space in my OMGsPrING2010 album
on Facebook?) made Andy appear less like the
silly, fun guy who sings about jizzing in his
pants. I'd personally like a $72,000 refund.

Accent mishandled Samberg show
With deference to Andy Samberg, last
night's event was disappointing to say the
least. Let me preface this by saying that if you
don't think $72,000 is a lot of money, just stop
reading and check out today's crossword.
Disappointment was not in Samberg -
quite the contrary. He was polite, charming,
humorous and weird (a compliment, accord-
ing to him). The disappointment I feel lies with
Accent.
But, you might say, Accent is a speakers bu-
reau, it says so right in its formal title. And you
would be correct. Perhaps it was too much of
me to hope that $72,000 could buy more than
just an hour-long, fireside chat about home
life, beginnings in comedy and awkward
pauses between interviewer and interviewee.
The "Inside the Actor's Studio"-themed night
felt trite, contrived and, again, awkward.
Why hire a performer and not allow him
to perform? If anything, we could learn from
his accomplishments by seeing them live in
action, not watching video clips of sketches
the majority of the audience has already seen.
A scholar speaks about his scholarly studies,
his life's work and answers questions about
real-world issues. It isn't illogical to say that
a comedian should do at least some comedy.
Instead, Samberg was asked out twice, asked
to name comedians he didn't like, asked what
he would do if he were a woman for a day (an-
swer: have a baby, of course), and even asked
how a chicken crossed the highway -the last
I can't knock because it does pertain to the co-
medic genre.
My issue is not with Samberg, but in the
way the event was approached. Take an A-list comedian and re-enact the most scintillat-
ing hour of television ever known to man (no
offense, James Lipton) -why, it's got to be a
hit! I understand Accent has a certain budget,
and they may do with it whatever they wish,
but -and I'm borrowing from a "Weekend
Update" segment here -really?
On the other hand, if it is true that a laugh is
good for the soul, I suppose $1,200 per minute
is a steal. Especially when we're in a budget
crisis. Besides, I'm not paying for it anyway -
thank you, Bright Futures.
The best quote of the night came from Sam-
berg himself: "Am I getting paid?" Yes, Andy.
You are.
To the two girls who asked Samberg out,
the answer is obvious -sure, if you have a
spare 72 grand. Maybe it could become a new
career path: $72,000 a pop would sure get you
a baker's dozen of Magnolia Bakery cupcakes
and a lifetime supply of Mr. Pibb and Red
Vines, with maybe even a little left over to rent
"The Chronicles of Narnia" on DVD. Who
could ask for more? I certainly couldn't.
Oh, and remember ladies: no flash photog-
raphy. That'll really cost you.

New Bright Futures standards will hurt
everyone
I think the idea that the Bright Futures
Scholarship Program is going to hurt minori-
ties is ridiculous. It is going to hurt everyone.
I'm a white, middle-class female, and I took
the ACT three times before finally reaching
the goal of 100 percent. I feel like we set a
low bar for minority students, when in reality
they have the same potential to achieve these
scores. As a future teacher, I believe everyone
can learn, and it's about time everyone adapt-
ed that principle. The purpose of Bright Fu-
tures is to help hardworking students afford
college. It's an incentive. Bright Futures is try-
ing to refrain from giving out such an incen-
tive by requiring higher scores, but that makes
it difficult not just for a certain group but for
everyone. Minority students are capable, very
intelligent and can achieve similar, if not bet-
ter, scores than their Caucasian peers.

LEED certification varying from
silver to gold to platinum, Arma-

According to Armaghani,
platinum certifications are re-

Residents react to
proposed tan tax
A tanning booth from LAE Tanning and Boutique is displayed. The tanning salon recently opened on
Newberry Road and 60th Street.0 CUSTOMERS WOULD BE
TAXED TEN PERCENT TO TAN.
By MELINDA CARSTENSEN
Alligator Contributing Writer
Tanning salon-goers seeking
bronzed bods will have to pay more
for a sun-kissed look this summer.
The new health care bill will im-
pose a 10 percent excise tax on tan-
ning salons starting July 1, and local
business owners are feeling burned.
Nancy Geisendurg, the owner of
Tan USA on Northwest 39th Ave-
nue, said the government is unfairly
discriminating against the tanning
industry by imposing the tax.
"If they had it across the board,
like [on] nail salons, masseuses -
thatwouldbe different," Geisendurg
said. "Why am I being targeted?"
Kelley Anderson, another localtanning salon owner who runs Lae
Tanning and Boutique on West Uni-
versity Avenue, agreed.
"Why pick on this industry?" she
said.
For all of the negative publicity
tanning salons get, Anderson said
there are a lot of misconceptions
about tanning and the vitamin D
health benefits it provides.
But for dermatologists and skin-
care advocates, the tax signified a
move in the right direction.
".Anytime you increase a price
on a service, you can be sure it's go-
ing to go down," said Mel Toran, the
executive director of North Central
Florida's American Cancer Society.
UF sophomore Kayla Stewart,
who tans in the winter, said the tax
may not stop her from tanning but
the change may be for the better.
"I don't blame them for it," she
said.
Marsh: Lowe's supporters could use his sexuality to his advantage
CAMPAIGN, from page 1
es on Islam and homosexuality, has made
it clear it will not support a gay mayor.
In a video posted on YouTube, Wayne
Sapp, a pastor with the Dove World Out-
reach Center, made the case that the city
of Gainesville cannot afford to have a gay
mayor.
"Here in Gainesville, they're getting
ready to have a run-off election between
two candidates, and one of them is openlya homo, gay, fag -whatever you want to
call him," Sapp said. "We got one running
for mayor of Gainesville, trying to convert
Gainesville into Homoville. We can't have
it. "
The video, which has since been re-
moved from YouTube due to a violation
of the site's terms of service, called out lo-
cal churches for not standing up for what,
Sapp said, the Bible preaches.
"We feel it's our obligation to speak
out that homosexuality is an unacceptable
lifestyle," said the Rev. Terry Jones, thechurch's senior pastor.
According to Jones, all videos put on-
line that feature Pastor Sapp or himself
have been endorsed and approved by the
Dove World Outreach Center
SpeCial church.
Report Such statements could in-
fringe upon Section 501c3 of
the IRS tax code, which regu-
lates political involvement by religious
groups.
Mike Dobzinski, the IRS spokesman for
the state of Florida, could not comment onthe church's specific case but did note that
any political participation by a religious
organization may jeopardize a church's
tax-exempt status.
As the election season continues, Marsh
said, members of Lowe's campaign could
use his sexual orientation for political ad-
vantage.
As far as using it as a political advan-
tage, Lowe and his campaign manager,
Garret Garner, were baffled.
"I don't even know how you would go
about doing that," Garner said.

Film festival and events raise awareness toa e , , a. -5 4 , , e a, 211-@2
go green
By ALEX ORLANDO
avenue writer
Shirley Lasseter isn't buying her grapes
from Chile anymore. Ray Weber is cutting
down on his energy consumption. David
Montgomery is reusing plastic food con-
tainers as flowerpots.
Those are some of the changes people
have been making after seeing "The Age
of Stupid" on Friday, the first of 12 films
and documentaries as part of the 10-day
Gainesville Environmental Film and Arts
Festival.
The festival's a not-for-profit event or-
ganized by the Hippodrome State Theatre
and GoGreenNation.org.
Admission is $3 for children, $4 for
students and senior citizens and $5 for
adults.
The festival is a collection of environ-
mentalfilms, documentaries and artshows
in the Sun Center behind the Hippodrome
State Theatre.
Lasseter, the festival's co-director, said
she hopes the films will promote environ-mental awareness in Gainesville. Trish Ri-
ley is the festival's other co-director.
"We're hoping to get people from all
over the community, not just people who
already know about the environment,"
Lasseter said.
"We're hoping to get people from
X @YcA Ae e A not just
people who already know about the
environment."
SHIRLEY LASSETER
festival co-director
Lasseter said since screening the films
before bringing them to the Hippodrome,
she has been more conscious in her deci-
sions at the grocery store.
She said she had never considered how
much money and fuel it costs to ship fruit
from other countries and the effect those
shipments might have on the environment.
She said she now tries to buy local foodsexclusively.
Lasseter said she would not know how
much money the festival raised or how
many people attended until after it is
over. She estimated the Hippodrome had
received $9,000 by Thursday afternoon.
She said the budget for the event was
$25,000.
About 120 attendees mingled among
columns' wall sconces, sipping wine and
nibbling hors d'oeuvres in the softly lit
basement of the Hippodrome Theatre Fri-
day in the festival's first event, the VIP re-
ception.
VIPs were those who donated either
out-of-pocket or through their own servic-
es to the festival.

What do you get when you
throw 90 bands on six different
venues in Gainesville? You get To-
tal Bummer, Gainesville's biggest
do-it-yourself music festival.
Total Bummer features bands
from all over the Southeastern,
and groups are coming from as
far as Wisconsin to take part in
the three-day music spectacle.
The lineup includes 15 bands who
are native to Gainesville such as
Averkio, Nervous Systems and
Quadrophones. With the genre
variety in this festival, there will
be something to suit everyone's
tastes.
Total Bummer is an effort to
help bands gain more attention,
as most groups are either still un-
signed or unknown to the masses.
The festival will run from Fri-
day to Sunday. According to Total
Bummer's Web site (totalbummer.
net), pre-sale tickets are $25 for
the entire weekend and include a
free T-shirt. They can be ordered
online or they can be purchased
at Spin Cycle. Also on the Web
site is a list of bands performing
and links to hear their music on-
line.

You are cordially invited to a Mad Hatter's ball.
Don't be late for this very important date.
You've seen the new movie, and you've read all
the books and maybe even had your own "down-
the-rabbit-hole experience," so what's next? Why,
a theme party, of course.
The Network Promotions, a Gainesville-based
nightlife promotions and event planning company,
is throwing the ball tomorrow night at 10. Accord-
ing to Glenn Cameron, a company employee, Rue
Bar will be transformed into a psychedelic world
of nonsense where the bizarre and the absurd will
become the norm.
"I hired two actors, one to play Alice and one
to play the Mad Hatter. We'll also have a magi-
cian on hand and a peculiar hat contest," he said.
The hat contest is open to all, and the winner will
receive a bar tab and a cell phone from Metro
PCs.
Cameron said the decorations will include rab-
bit prints walking away from the doors and upside-
down umbrellas on the ceiling as well as paper
lanterns, Victorian chairs and a huge photo back-
ground to take photos.
"We're into doing themes because those are a
lot cooler and more fun," he said.
Cameron has been working at the company for
about a year, but he said he "kind of fell into event
planning by accident."
"I'm a biology major at UF, but I enjoy planning
and creating these events, and I'm learning a lot
about business in the process," he said. "I'm just
too far into my degree to switch majors, so I'm go-
ing to finish it out."

Atten-tion! Bootcamp pushes students to new levels

For 30 seconds, you and a partner
are shoulder- pressing a 30-pound
tire together over your head. Just
when your shoulders can't take it any-
more, you're running 40 yards at full
speed. Your jog to the next station is
your break, only to throw a 10-pound
medicine ball as hard as you can to
your partner after squatting and then
lungingforward with it. You throw back
and forth with your partner for 50 sec-
onds.
Throughout the next hour, your
body will stay in motion without any
breaks longer than 30 seconds,
which is just long enough to gulp
some water. Welcome to bootcamp.

using high-intensity exercise followed
by low-intensity exercise.
For example, you may run up three
flights of stairs full speed and then do
a wall sitfor 50 seconds. After the wall
sit, you'll do calf raises with your toes
pointing inward for 30 seconds and
then run back up the stairs, repeating
this circuit numerous times.
Boot camps also differ by focusing
on performing an exercise for a spe-
cific length of time, not repetitions.
"Basically, we have an unlimited
number of workouts," Marhefka said.
"I write a new workout every night."
UF freshman Lindsey Cous-
ineau, 17, found out about Bo-
ris' Bootcamps by word of mouth
through her sorority, Delta Gamma.
Although she can utilize the different
on-campus gyms for free, Cousineau
prefers Boris' Bootcamps because
the classes are outside and more en-
gaging compared with being stuck in
a gym and counting the minutes on a
treadmill, she said.
Carlee Daylor, 20, a UF elementary
education major, said she enjoys the
fact that bootcamps require little in-
struction and skill.
"I don't really like going to the gym
a lot because I'm not very good with
the equipment and it's boring so at
boot camp, it's different. We switch
it up a lot," Daylor said. (Marhefka)

fun because we're outside and there's

UF student David Yergery, 21, also
prefers Boris' Bootcamps because
they help provide structure to working
out.

told me about it, I thought it was a

Marhefka, who graduated from
UF in 2008 with a degree in finance

the nickname "Boris" came from his
friends who felt that his first name
didn't match well with his Czech and
Russian ancestry, he said.
"Our muscles (including our heart
and lungs) adapt quickly to repetitive
training and growth slows or plateaus.

Party poolside with sun, drinks
By ALLISON BANKO
avenue writer
Welcome back, Florida. It's been
about four months since we've
been graced by your usual, bright
and shining self. Our long-await-
ed warm weather is finally upon
us, and the forecast for upcoming
weeks is looking mighty delicious.
Highs will be topping out in the 70s
and lows, just on the brim of the 50s.
So sayonara Jack Frost. It's time to
party poolside.
These splash bashes have a lot
more to offer than a great tan. Danc-
ing to a DJ, getting loads of freebies
and socializing with friends are just
a few of the activities at pool par-
ties.
"There is always a lot of people
and so many things to do. I'm so
excited that they are starting up
again," Santa Fe sophomore and
frequent pool party attendee Jenna
Umlauf said.
The Estates kicked off the shorts-
wearing weather by hosting one
of their usual pool party blowouts
Saturday. The Estates pool parties
are so outrageous that its manage-
ment can't even discuss them-butif you're lucky, maybe you can
squeeze something out of its fluo-
rescent pink gorilla, who is always
on the guest list.
If you missed it, don't worry-
the plethora of spring pool parties
hasn't even scratched the surface.
The Network Promotions is hold-
ing a monumental pool party at
Gainesville Place Apartments with
special guest Percy Harvin on Sat-
urday.
Harvin, former Gator and NFL
Rookie of the
Year, will be heat-
ing it up with par-
tygoers, enjoying
complimentary
smoothies from

drinks and sipping off of the many
free Bud Light kegs.
"The Network doesn't just have
pool parties. We put on shows at
our events. Local artist KB da Boss
will be performing a few of his
songs live," co-owner of The Net-
work Promotions Glenn Cameron
said.
Whateveryourwaterside activity
of choice maybe, partygoers shouldfollow a few tricks of the trade.
First off, keep what you bring to
the pool party to a minimum. Girls,
your bikinis won't (or shouldn't)
be equipped with pockets, so keep
it simple with sunscreen, a towel,
ID and a camera-obviously you'll
want to document the occasion and
post pictures on Facebook. To be
camera-ready, make sure that your
bathing suit matches your tan lines
because donning a farmer's tan is a
definite don't.
If you're legal to drink, perhaps
take pictures before you guzzle
down beer. Many times beer causes
bloating, so if you are concerned
about not being mistaken for a
nearby floatie, snap your pictures as
soon as possible. Also, be sure that
your swimsuit is securely fastened
because you don't want any ward-
robe malfunctions taking place dur-
ing chicken fights or possible pool-
side grinding.
But attending a pool party
doesn't mean you absolutely have
to get wet and wild. You can opt to
lay low and simply take advantage
of the weather by laying out and
soaking up the sun. People-watch-
ing is always entertaining.Fashion week ahead

Fashion has no limits. It's
daring, risky and of course,
fabulous. Tuesday evening,
Gainesville Fashion Week and
CovetedList.com proved the ab-
sence of style's boundaries with
a fashion show that featured
outfits fitting women of all col-
ors, heights and body types.
The melting pot of models
rocked looks by Dahlia Bou-
tique, Wolfgang Boutique, Mesh
Boutique and the designer, Bob-

While the show unveiled out-
fits for every fashionista, it had
a message deeper than the sur-
face of a funky dress. The show
gave light to UF's Health and
Fitness week, promoting staying
healthy-no matter what your
dress size may be. The event,
entertaining a crowd of about125, also served as a small
taste of what's to come during
Gainesville Fashion Week and
was the first time the organiza-
tion has evertaken its runwayto
the UF campus.
All of the featured design-
ers from Tuesday's event in the
Reitz Union Grand Ballroom will
have their own runway shows
during Gainesville Fashion
Week on April 7 to 11.
Gainesville Fashion Week-
spans over a five-day period and
consists of an array of different
events dedicated to art and
fashion in the Gainesville area.
The events will showcase de-
signers from Tuesday's runway
show along with names such
as Calzatura, Kenneth McCrane

Festival brings worldy beers
By RICHARD 0. STEHLI
avenue writer
Take it from me: There is no better way to
spend a weekend than drinking good beer and
eatingfree food. If these activities are relevantto
your interests, look no further than The Greater
Gator Beer Festival. This Saturday, for the price
of admission, you get ample helpings of food
from local restaurants, premium entertainment,
and most importantly -unlimited beer samples
from across the country and around the world.
Big national names like Budweiser, Michelob,
and Yuengling are sure to be in attendance with
beer you already know you love. From the state
of Florida, expect to see Keywest Brewery prod-
ucts and one of my personal favorites, Orange
Blossom Pilsner. Other domestic craft brewer-
ies will be on hand as well, such as Colorado's
Oskar Blues Brewery, New York's Southern Tier
Brewery and Maine's Shipyard Brewery, makers
of the fall favorite, Pumpkinhead.
The only thing more exciting than the selec-
tion of domestic beer at your fingertips might be
the imported beer available at the festival.
After your first few beers this weekend, you
might feel the need to get some solid food in
your stomach, and the festival has you covered:
Several local restaurants will be on hand with
unlimited food to satisfy your hunger and keepyour blood-alcohol content in check. This year's
festival will be catered by BubbaQue's, Panama
Joe's, Hungry Howie's and Beef '0' Brady's, just
to name a few.
To get the most out of your Greater Gator
Beer Festival experience, start slow and pace
yourself. Think quality over quantity and diversi-
ty over familiarity. Aim to try things you've never
had before and take the time to wait in a line for
something you know you want.
Most importantly, have someone pick you up
when the event is over. You will be drinking beer
for several hours, and if you drink anywhere near
your money's worth, you will notBehind be good to drive. If you some-
how fail to plan accordingly, the
festival offers a service to take
you home at no cost.
The Greater Gator Beer Festival will take
place Saturday from 1 to 5 p.m. at Magnolia
Parke, 4700 NW 39th Ave. Tickets are $30
online, $35 at the gate and $40 for online-
only Instant In passes -this means no waiting
in line when you arrive at the event. You can
buy $25 advance tickets at Art of Billiards, Beef
'0' Brady's, Gator Beverage, Gator's Dockside,
Stubbies, Mother's, Kazbor's Sports Grille and
BJ's Pub & Grill.
Check the Alligator online next Monday for
photos, videos and other news from the festival.~

Slightly Stoopid, G. Love & Special Sauce play free show
By ASHLEY MCCREDIE
avenue writer
UF will be taken over by bluey-hip-
hop and funky-punk-reggae beats on
Saturday.
Student Government Productions
Music & Entertainment is bringing
Slightly Stoopid and G. Love & Special
Sauce to Flavet Field for free from 6
p.m. to 10 p.m.
The event is in conjunction with
IRHApalooza, and in addition to great
music there will be bounce houses,
cotton candy and snow cones.
SGP has spent $85,000 on this
show, according to SGP chairman Aar-
on Crespin.
"We have pulled out all the stops
and are excited for an extremely uplift-
ing day," Crespin said.
Disneynature is also sponsoring
the show.
The Avenue had a chance to sit
down with Slightly Stoopid's drum-
mer Ryan "RyMo" Moran before he
chomped down on some food at his
California home.
A -What does Slightly Stoopid do
to get ready for a show?
R- Typically, we get to our place, get
to the venue early, get our stuff set up,
hang out, eat a little bit, sound check,
have dinner, throw back a cocktail or
two.
A -What's your cocktail of choice?
R -We've got a few, but right now a
lot of the guys are drinkin' Grey Goose
with Gatorade and a splash of soda or
a splash of Red Bull.

mind, and then musically it's more of
a collective effort.A -What should UF expect from the
show on Saturday?
R -I think it's just going to be a big
fun party. If you've ever seen G. Love or
ever seen Slightly Stoopid, we're just
about having a good time. You know,
have a couple of drinks, have somefun, forget your cares and let yourself
just kind of flow with the music for a

I loved being in college. It was my first

kind of figured out my limits.
A -Does Slightly Stoopid have any
albums in the works?
R -At this point in time we're just
starting to record and get some ideas
together. (We) will probably have an al-
bum out by fall this year or maybe as
late as spring next year.
A -If you could pick any musician or
group to play with, who would it be?
R -I'd really want to tour with the

be fun. They seem like cool guys.
A -Words of wisdom for the UF

R -Be cool and stay in school. And
come out and have good time when
you come to the show. Just bringsome
smiles and enjoy the music.

THURSDAY, MARCH 25, 2010 U STUDENT LIVING GUIDE, ALLIGATOR, 21
Gainesville has plenty of off-campus housing including apartments,
condos, houses, and rooms for rent. Take your time when looking for
a place to live and follow the tips below for finding the right place for
you:
+ Use the Off Campus Housing Locator Service at http://housing.
offcampus.ufl.edu.
+ Know your budget and choose a property that allows you to live
within your means.
w Create a priority list. What do you care about most in a liv-
ing space? Room size, rent, type of lease, type of community (large
undergrad population, graduate students, local residents, etc.), location,
proximity to campus or bus route.all these things are factors to consider
in choosing a place to live. Write out a list of ideal characteristics you
want in your future living space and keep these criteria in mind when
selecting a location.
+ Choose a well-suited roommate or choose to live alone. Know
what kind of person would best compliment your personality and
choose accordingly.
+ Drive around and visit the place and neighborhood you are look-
ing to live in.
+ Take a tour of the complexes or houses that interest you, ask
questions, and get to know the complex management or rental house
landlord.
+ Ask your friends for advice on where to live. Which properties
worked well for them? Which didn't?
+ Check with local Law Enforcement for crime statistics on the area
you choose to live in by calling 352-955-1818.
+ Go back to the property at night and make some observations. Is
it well lit, do you see the security guard that management promised, is
the security gate working, is it quiet enough to study, how close is the
bus stop or parking to the complex or house, etc.?
+ Once you've narrowed down your search make an appointment
with UF's Student Legal Services by calling 352-392-LAWS or visit their
website www.studentlegalservices.ufl.edu for more information. SbS
can help you in reviewing the lease BEFORE you sign it. This is a great
way to know what your legal responsibilities will be under that lease.
+ Gainesville is a GREAT place to rent and live so have fun with
your search.~Leases~
ake sure you read and fully
understand all aspects of the
ee before signing. A lease
is a contract between you and your
landlord that spells out specific details
of your living arrangement Leases
often involve policies about pets, secu-
rity and pet deposits, legal entry and
other important information. Typi-
cally, leases in Gainesville are for 12
months. If you will need your place for
10 months or less, talk with the man-
agement about whether they can pro-
vide you a shorter term lease. There
are two types of leases that are usually
available, Joint Leases and Individual
Leases.
All roommates are held responsible
for the lease. If one person breaks the
lease, the other roommates are held
responsible for paying the total rent.
This tends to be the lease more promi-
nent when renting a house or single
family dwelling.
Each person is held responsible for
his or her own actions. For instance,
if one roommate breaks the lease, thatperson is still responsible for paying
their own rent. For most college stu-
dents, individual leases are the best
choice. Each person in the lease is
responsible for his or her own actions
and not the actions of a roommate.
+ Dates of occupancy
+ Amount of monthly rent and the
date it is due each month
+ Amount of Security Deposit
+ Responsibility for payment of
utilities
+ Responsibility for general mainte-
nance and repairs
+ Sublease: If you sign a 12 month
lease but think you may need the
dwelling for a shorter period of time,
make sure the lease allows you to sub-
lease (rent your dwelling to another
person who will assume the remainder
of your lease)
+ Pet policy
+ Automatic renewal clause
+ Type of lease: joint vs. individual
+ At management's discretion, the
tenant may be asked to leave within
three days
+ Tenant waives all defects in thebuilding
+ Landlord shall not be responsible
for injury to person, including tenant
and guests, as a result of any cause
+ Tenant is responsible for all re-
pairs to premises
+ Landlord may enter dwelling
without notice
+ Landlord has a lien (a legal claim
on the property of another as security
for the payment of a debt) on all per-
sonal property of tenant
A great University of Florida re-
source available to full-time students is

tions on your lease, contact Student
Legal Services and set up an appoint-
ment with a lawyer to help review
it BEFORE you sign it. Visit www.

J{aving a roommate is a greatway to divide the cost of living
f campus, but if you don't
find the right person to live with, liv-
ing off- campus could be challenging.
Below are some tips that will help you
if you are thinking about living with a
roommate.
+ Communication is key. Talk
about your budget for housing, ex-
pectations for safety, expectations for
guests, and what your housing needs
are before you even begin your search.
Being on the same page as your room-
mates will make your co-habitation ex-perience much better and reduce the
possibility of conflict.
+ Start with a friend or sibling.
These are often good options for room-
mates since you already know them.
+ Consider a person you went to
high school with or a friend you have
made while here at UF.
+ Before moving in, come to an
agreement about who will get which
bedroom and bathroom along with
which cabinets/storage space each per-
son can use.
+ Discuss how payment of rent and
bills will take place. Is each personresponsible for their own bills or will

Insurance~L f you are thinking about renting a
house or apartment, Renters Insur-
ce provides important coverage
for both you and your possessions. A
standard Renter's Policy protects your
personal property in case of theft or
damage and may pay for temporary
living expenses if your rental is dam-
aged (including loss of use). It can also
shield you from personal liability. Any-
one who leases a house or apartment
should consider this type of coverage.
Talk with your parents before
getting your own renter's policy. If
you are still financially dependent on
your parents or a family member and
they own a home, they might be able
to cover you under their homeowner's
policy. Some homeowner policies will
cover a dependent's rental property
Check with the office of Off-
Campus Life at (352) 392-2161, ext.
214, or their web site http://www.dso.
ufl.edu/offcampus for assistance.
Rental opportunities may also
be found in the classified sections of

Tn Gainesville, there is a glut of available apart-
ments. You should examine several apart-
.nents before signing a lease.
+ Application Deposits: Never put down
a deposit to hold an apartment unless you have
a written agreement indicating whether it is re-
fundable.
+ Cost: Can you afford it? Even if your
roommates leave?
+ Location: Is the neighborhood safe? Even
at night? Are you within easy walking or cycling
distance of campus? Are buses available?
+ City Limits: Gainesville protects tenants
by enforcing housing codes. The city will order
landlords to make repairs. If a complaint is filed,
Alachua County will inspect apartments and is-
sue a report of violations.
+ Model Apartments: Never sign a lease
based upon a model. Insist on seeing your actual
apartment.
+ Pest Control: Does the landlord maintain
a regular spraying program? +
+ Function: Check appliances, run water
in all sinks, showers and tubs, flush toilets, and
check air conditioning and heating.
+ Appearance: Is it clean? Do the carpets
look worn or smell bad? Has the apartment beenrecently painted? Do the walls have nail holes?
+ Inventory: Note all defects on the inven-
tory sheet or check-in list signed by the landlord
or an impartial witness. Photograph or videotape
the apartment at move in.
+ Landlord: Speak to tenants of the apart-
ment complex. Does the landlord make a habit
of unannounced entries? Are repairs made
quickly?
+ Noise and Parking: Check for noise and
parking problems by visiting the apartment at
various times during the day, at night and on
weekends.
+ Safety: Are there deadbolts on the doors?
Are hallways and parking lots well lit? If there
are sliding glass doors, are there adequate locks to
deter forced entry? You can contact the Alachua
County Sheriff's Office or the Gainesville Police
Department to obtain information on crime in
the area.
+ Single-Family Housing: The landlord
may legally provide fewer services for houses and
duplexes. The landlord may also shift mainte-
nance responsibilities to you in the lease. In some
neighborhoods, only three unrelated persons may
live together. Check with the city if you plan on
having more than two roommates.

+ My Landlord Refuses To Make Repairs.What
Can I Do?
You MAY be able to either withhold your rent or
terminate your lease if the problem constitutes a material
breach of the lease or the Act. You must follow the exact
requirements of the Act. You must give the landlord a
written notice demanding the repairs be made in seven
days. The notice must indicate your intention to terminate
the lease or withhold rent if the repairs are not made.
This is a complicated process and the legal consequences
are very serious. You should obtain legal advice before
attempting to terminate your lease or withhold rent.
+ Can I Deduct Repair Costs From My Rent?
No. The Act does not authorize you to make repairs
or to recover the cost of such repairs. In fact, most
apartment leases prohibit repairs by tenants. When the
landlord refuses to make repairs, the Act gives you a
qualified right to terminate the lease or withhold rent.
As previously indicated, you should consult an attorney
before attempting to terminate the lease or withhold
rent.
+ Can My Rent Be Increased During My Lease
Term?
Not unless the lease contains a specific provision
allowing for a rent increase. From the tenant's perspective,
one of the primary reasons for having a written lease is
to lock in the rent for the rental period. Normally, you
should not sign a lease providing for a rent increase.
+ Can My Landlord Enter My ApartmentWithout
Notice?
No. Unless there is an emergency, or you have
abandoned your apartment, the landlord must provide
reasonable notice and obtain your consent prior to
entering your apartment.You cannot unreasonably withhold consent. If the
landlord persists in entering without notice or consent,
contact an attorney.
+ How Soon Must I Renew My Lease?
There is no time period established by the Act. You
should not sign a lease that provides for automatic
renewals or requires you to give the landlord a notice
of nonrenewal. If you do sign such a lease, you must
strictly comply with the notice requirements imposed by
the lease.
If the lease does not specify otherwise, renewals are a
matter of general contract law. The landlord cannot force
you to renew prior to the end of your lease. However,
if you do not renew by the landlord's "deadline", the
landlord may rent your apartment to someone else.
+ Do I Really Need Insurance For MyPersonal
Property?
Yes. Unless you are financially able to replace all
your belongings, you should have insurance. Proper
insurance coverage will protect you against the loss of
your valuables in most circumstances. Landlords are
legally responsible for such losses only under very specific,
limited circumstances which may be very difficult to
prove in court.
If you are a resident-relative of your parents,
your personal property may be insured through their
homeowner's policy. Have your parents confirm the
coverage in writing with their insurance agent.
If coverage is not available through your parents'
homeowner's policy, you may be able to purchase renter's
insurance. Even with insurance, there are certain
precautions you should always take. Always lock your
apartment securely even if you are only going next door.
Never leave jewelry, cameras, cash, checkbooks, credit
cards, or other valuables in plain sight.

"I cannot afford the rent?" No!
"I need to work this summer?" No!
"The neighborhood is unsafe?" No!
Under the Act, you can only terminate the lease if the
landlord is materially violating your lease or the Act. You
should obtain legal advice before attempting to terminate
your lease. In many cases, the best thing you can do is find
replacement tenants.
Usually. The landlord cannot unreasonably withhold
consent to an assignment or sublease. The landlord
may require potential replacement tenants to submit an
application including a credit check. The landlord may also
charge a reasonable sublet fee even when you provide the
replacement tenants. Normally you remain liable under your
lease if the replacement tenants do not pay rent or damage
the apartment. Some landlords will release you from the
obligations of your lease. If you are being released, get it in
writing.
~uwi~ a ~i mr~u ~r a
Ia
No. Some tenants will walk out on a lease and receive
no adverse action, while others will be pursued to the fullest
extent of the law. In Gainesville's current rental market, the
odds are that you will be sued unless you supply acceptable
replacement tenants.
Your losses in court will not be limited to your security
deposit, but will include rent for each month the apartment
remains vacant during the term of your lease, plus court
costs and the landlord's attorney's fees.What Steps Can I Take To Protect My Security
Deposit?
When you take occupancy of the apartment, complete a
thorough written inventory of the apartment's condition and
have the landlord or an impartial witness sign the inventory.
Make sure you keep a copy of the inventory. This helps protect
you from the landlord claiming you caused pre-existing damage.
When you move out, completely and thoroughly clean the
apartment Some landlords provide a checklist outlining the
cleaning they expect you to do.
Keep all your receipts for cleaning supplies and professional
carpet cleaning as evidence. Before you leave, ask the landlord to
inspect the apartment with you. Complete a move-out checklist
and make sure the landlord signs and dates it. Use an impartial
witness if the landlord is not available or refuses your request.
Move-in and move-out photographs or videotape are also strongly
recommended in case there is a dispute.
+ Can I Use My Security Deposit For The Last Month's
Rent?
No. Landlords can legally evict you for non-payment of rent
even when your "security" deposit is equal to your last month's
rent.
The purpose of the security deposit is to protect the landlord
against damages to the apartment.
+ Does The Law Require Interest Payments On Security
Deposits?
+ What Are My Duties As A
Tenant?
First, last, and always PAY
RENT!*Comply with all other lease
terms.*Comply with all rules and
regulations.*Comply with housing and
health codes.*Comply with all zoning
restrictions.*Keep the apartment clean
and sanitary.*Keep plumbing fixtures
sanitary.*Donotdamagetheapartment*Do
not disturb your neighbors.
+ What Exactly Is An Eviction?
An eviction is the formal end to your
right to occupy the apartment. It does not
end your duty to pay rent An eviction
starts with a Summons. You must file
an Answer within 5 days. Contact an
attorney immediately.
If the court rules against you, aLandlords must hold security deposits in one of three methods.
Two methods of holding the deposits require interest to be paid.
The method which does not require interest payments is the
one most landlords use. The landlord is required to inform
you in writing how your deposit is being held, where it is held,
and whether you will receive interest
+ What Can I Do If My LandlordDoesn't Return My
Deposit?
A landlord shall have 15 days after termination of the lease
to return the security deposit together with interest if otherwise
required, if he or she does not intend to impose a claim on the
security deposit If the landlord intends to impose a claim on the
security deposit, he or she shall have 30 days to give the tenant
written notice by certified mail, stating how much is going to
be deducted and why. You must object to the deduction in
writing within 15 days from the date you receive the notice, or
the landlord will be authorized to deduct his or her claim from
your security deposit.
If the landlord fails to give the required notice within the
30-day period, he or she forfeits the right to impose a claim upon
the security deposit.
However, if you damaged the apartment, the landlord can
sue you even when the 30-day notice is not given. Because the
landlord can also get court costs and attorney's fees, you should
consult an attorney before filing any lawsuits.
judgment for possession of the apartment,
unpaid rent, late fees, interest, court costs
and attorney's fees will be entered for the
landlord. The sheriff will post a notice at
the apartment that requires you to vacate
in 24 hours. If you do not vacate within 24
hours, the sheriff will remove you and your
personal property from the apartment.
+ What Can Happen If I Don't Pay
Rent?
Failure to pay rent is the quickest way
to be evicted. The landlord will serve a
notice demanding payment of rent or
possession of the apartment If you fail to
comply with the demand within 3 days,
excluding weekends and holidays, eviction
proceedings may be started.
Neither surrender of the apartment nor
eviction ends your liability for rent Youshould immediately contact an attorney
upon receipt of a 3-day notice.
+ Can I Be Evicted For Any Other
Reason?
Yes. Your lease can be terminated
if you violate any lease terms, rules and
regulations, or the Act. If your lease is
terminated and you do not vacate the
apartment, the landlord may immediately
file for your eviction.
Termination begins with a 7-day
notice. Your options depend on whether
the violations are classified as "curable" or
"noncurable".
If you receive either type of notice, you
should immediately contact an attorney.
Neither termination of your lease, nor your
eviction from the apartment ends your
liability for rent

Gators need Bostic to step into leadership role
* A.J. JONES IS THE ONLY
RETURNING STARTER.
By MIKE McCALL
Alligator Staff Writer
mmccall@alligator org
Sam, Mike and Will are cov-
ered, but Brandon and Ryan will
be much harder to replace.
With a talented crop of line-
backers, Florida won't have trou-
ble filling in its depth chart with
able bodies. Finding someone to
take over for Brandon Spikes and
Ryan Stamper is another story.
Stamper and Spikes combined
for 146 tackles last season, finishing
first and third on the team, respec-
tively, but the largest void they left
behind is on the leadership front.
Spikes' enthusiasm and Stamp-
er's cerebral approach to the game
provided contrasting figures for
the rest of the defense to look up
to, and the Gators are hoping for
similar personalities to emerge
during spring practice.
That starts with sophomore Jon
Bostic, who's competing for thestarting middle linebacker spot
with Brendan Beal and Lorenzo
Edwards.
"It's a change. I've always been
the youngest one out here, and
now it's time to step up," Bostic
said. "I've always been a quiet
person on the field. I've never re-
ally been a loud talker, so my main
thing is speaking up on the field
and telling everybody what the
call is, what the formation is, all
those things."
First-year linebackers coach D.J.
Durkin expects Bostic and Beal to
grow into those roles as they gain
more experience through spring
practice.
In the meantime, they're mak-
ing up for their lack of polish with
sheer effort.
"They're not at that point yet
where they're comfortable," Dur-
kin said. "The thing I like is, they're
both competing and playing fast
right now. Not always fast in the
right direction, but playing fast, so
we can work with that."
Playing fast is likely to be the
SEE LINEBACKERS, PAGE 37Harrison Diamond / Alligator Staff
UF linebacker Jon Bostic is competing with Brendan Beal for the starting middle linebacker job. The
Gators are also testing out using both at the same time.
Meyer gives story new life
Deonte Thompson didn't make awhole lot of headlines on the foot-
ball field last season, but he's cer-
tainly made his fair share -unintentional
as they may be -during the first two
weeks of spring practice.
The third-year wideout was asked how
having John Brantley at quarterback was
better for receivers than Tim Tebow (which
he is) and Thompson dropped this quote.
"You never know with Tim," Thomp-
son said. "You can bolt, you think he's
running but he'll come up and pass it to
you. You just have to be ready at all times.
With Brantley, everything's with rhythm,
time. You know what I mean, a real quar-
terback."
Thompson let out one of the team's
dirtiest little secrets: Tim Tebow won a lot
of games and is beloved by The Gator Na-
tion, but some players are happy to see a
few more touches with Tebow gone.
I've heard from multiple players that
the team was excited for Brantley to play
quarterback so that the Gators could throw
the ball around a little more.
Does this mean Tebow didn't give themU
Kyle Maistri
Kyle Points
kma istri@a Iligator orga better shot to win?
No.
Does it mean
Thompson thinks
Tebow is worse
than Brantley? Not
necessarily.
What it does
mean is that Thomp-
son (and I'm posi-
tive he's not alone)
knows he will get more chances to make
plays with Brantley than with Tebow, and
shame on him, he's happy about it.
It's not right for members of the me-
dia to act like Thompson was going af-
ter Tebow just for the sake of going after
Tebow, but it's not right for Urban Meyer
to act like Thompson said nothing contro-
versial.
It's that mix of polar-opposite attitudes
that came to a head after Wednesday's
practice.

Steve McClain huddled every member

SEE KYLE, PAGE 37UF MEN'S BASKETBALLShipman leaving Florida
By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
a berry@a Iligator org
Sophomore Ray Shipman will transfer
from Florida, coach Billy Donovan con-
firmed Wednesday.
The 6-foot-5 guard decided to leave
the program after averaging just 12.4
minutes per game last season and serv-
ing in a limited role during his two years
with the Gators.
"I appreciate the opportunity that the
University of Florida gave me," Shipman
said. "I want to thank coach Donovan,
the staff and my teammates for the last
two years, and I wish the University of
Florida the best in the future moving for-
ward. I'm looking forward to making a
decision to go somewhere with an oppor-
tunity for a bigger role."
Shipmanwas seemingly unable to earn
Donovan's trust, even when he was play-
ing well, despite the fact that UF's coach
constantly pointed to a lack of depth in
his team's backcourt.
In the team's last two regular-season
games, Shipman scored five points insix minutes against Vanderbilt and nine
points in nine minutes at Kentucky. But
he barely saw the floor in the second half
of those games, as Donovan continued to
play guards Erving Walker and Kenny
Boynton for a team-high 32.9 minutes per
game.
"He had mixed views on his position
there at Florida," said Rosalind Shipman,
Ray's mother.
Florida's 2008 "Mr.
Basketball" actually
saw his playing time
decrease from his fresh-
man campaign, whenhe
averaged 13.2 minutes
Sipman er game. Shipman's
offensive numbers took
a hit as well, going from 3.8 points per
game on 49 percent shooting to 2.7 points
per game on 44 percent shooting.
Before the season, Donovan said Ship-
man focused too much on his offense as
a freshman. Already considered a defen-
sive specialist after his first year, Shipman
continued to be one of UF's most reliable
defenders during his sophomore season.

LOWED JUST ONE RUN.

If the Gators are losing a game
later in the season, coach Kevin
O'Sullivan wants his team to think
about Wednesday night.
No. 2 Florida (17-3) trailed Flor-
ida Gulf Coast by eight runs in the
second inning, but UF scored five to
take the lead in the fourth, and the
Gators' bullpen silenced the Eagles
(12-7) in a 13-8 comeback win.
"We just kept chipping away,"
O'Sullivan said. "(FGCU) has a re-
ally good club and a really good hit-
ting team. It was remarkable to fall
behind 8-0 and put zeroes on the
board for the rest of the way."
The offense was sparked by
fourth-inning home runs by second
baseman Josh Adams and senior
Matt den Dekker. With two outs and
runners on the corners, den Dekker
drove a fastball to the left-field
bleachers to give UF a 9-8 lead.
"To finally break through and
get the lead is nice when you get be-
hind like that," den Dekker said of
the homer. "It's something our team
does. We battle. We're not going to
give up."
WhenFlorida trailed Florida State
by seven on March 2, O'Sullivan said
his team became impatient. Three
weeks later, the Gators learned from
their mistakes and did not panic.
"We're going to get down in

Thompson's quotes were blown up in the
national media.
None of us were happy about that, but
pretty much everyone understood why.
McClain said that it was not the local
media's fault that it happened, but obvi-
ously Meyer felt otherwise.
After practice was over, he got in the
face of the Orlando Sentinel beat reporter,
who suggested strongly that Thompson
was taking a shot at Tebow, and more or
less threatened him in front of 20 or so oth-
er media members.
"You'll be out of practice, you under-
stand that?" Meyer said. "If you do that
again. I told you five years ago: Don't mess
with our players. Don't do it. You did it.
You do it one more time and the Orlando
Sentinel's not welcome here ever again. IsBefore UF could drive runs in,
the Eagles gave one away for free.
FGCU starter Patrick Nathanson
held UF hitless in two innings, buthe allowed a run in the second when
he walked four Gators.
UF scored another run in the
third inning when den Dekker was

that clear? It's yes or no."
He went on to say: "If that was my son,
we'd be going at it right now.'
Many will question why Meyer took
such a public forum to voice his displea-
sure with one individual, ensuring that
this story would continue to grow for at
least another few days. I certainly wouldn't
have written this column if not for what
happened Wednesday.
In fact, had the team just let the media
talk to players and coaches as scheduled,
I'm sure no one would've written another
word on this story.
By cutting off access, the team seemed
to be sending a message that it wantssto-
ries like this to die, but Meyer's outburst
did nothing but give it a longer shelf life.
Did he lose his cool? Was he just de-
fending his player? Was he trying to make
a statement to his team that the media is
the enemy?
I can't know for sure.
But if the goal was to make this story go
away, Meyer did the exact opposite.hit by a pitch with the bases loaded.
Eagles' hurlers struggled with their
control all game, hitting three bat-
ters and walking 10 more.
By contrast, UF's relievers were
dominant. Using five pitchers in 7.2
innings, the bullpen allowed just
one run while the offense mounted
a comeback.
The team found itself in a hole
when FGCU battered UF starter
Anthony DeSclafani. After retiring
the first three hitters, DeSclafani was
pounded in the second inning.
The sophomore hung pitches
high in the strike zone and allowed
six hits in the frame. He also commit-
ted a throwing error and hit a batter
before O'Sullivan pulled him.
The bad outing was FSU d6jA vu
for DeSclafani, who allowed five
runs and retired no batters against
the Seminoles. Between that game
and Wednesday's outing, DeSclafani
surrendered a combined 11 earned
runs in 1.1 innings.The Gators pitch-
er has a 1.20 ERA in his other three
starts this season.
O'Sullivan experimented with
his lineup by putting freshman Aus-
tin Maddox at third base. Maddox,
who has played first on the rare oc-
casion that he wasn't the designated
hitter, made a leaping catch on a line
drive in the fifth.
O'Sullivan said Maddox could
see time at third this weekend
against Ole Miss.
"We've always known that he
could do it," O'Sullivan said. "It was
good to get him out there and get
him ready for this weekend."
Gators stop pursuing top recruit
HOOPS, from page 36
But due to his lack of skill as a ball-
handler and tendency to turn the ball
over, Shipman couldn't crack the lineup
in crunch time.
Donovan thought Shipman gained a
renewed sense of confidence after being
named Southeastern Conference Schol-
ar-Athlete of the Year at the end of the
season, but it never affected his playing
time.
"I have truly enjoyed coaching Ray the
last two seasons," Donovan said. "He's an
outstanding person and a great student. I
want to wish Ray the best of luck as he
pursues the things that are important to
him as a player and as a student."
Shipman is the 13th player to transfer
from UF since 2003, and his departure
will hurt UF's already-thin backcourt,
which now consists of Boynton, Walker
and Rod Tishman, who played just 2.3
minutes per game as a freshman.
If every other player returns to theGators, Donovan will have two remain-
ing scholarships to offer potential re-
cruits.

KNIGHT: Another player who won't be

According to a Scout.com report, Flor-
ida is no longer pursuing five-star pros-
pect Brandon Knight, the 6-foot-3 point
guard from Fort Lauderdale.
Donovan has repeatedly stressed his
team's need for another guard, and it
was assumed that Knight's relationship
with Boynton would be a major draw,
but Scout.com cited a source that said the
Gators took themselves out of the run-
ning for Knight.
It has been widely projected that
Knight will choose to attend Kentucky,
becoming the next player in a long line

Calipari.

International Waters
By MATT RUBIN
Alligator Writer
hey come from all over the
world.
Competing internation-
ally for their countries, there are
few who are faster in water. Hail-
ing from lands near and far, they all
have gathered for the same meet.
Leaping into the water, they dash
from wall to wall, water splashing,
teammates cheering.
If one reads the names on the
heat sheet, they might assume they
were at the World Championships
or another international event.
While the idea wouldn't be far-
fetched, it would be wrong.
As the spectator takes a closer
look, the orange and blue gives it
away. There's no United States, Co-
lumbia, South Africa or any other
country's flag waving, just those of
The Gator Nation.
Nine of the 12 swimmers rep-
resenting Florida at the NCAA
Championships were not born in
the U.S. -Brett and Shaune Fraser
(Cayman Islands), Balazs Gercsak
(Hungary), Roberto Gomez (Vene-
zuela), Marco Loughran (England),
Joey Pedraza (Cuba), Omar Pinzon
(Colombia), Sebastien Rousseau
(South Africa) and Roland Rudolf
(Hungary).
"I don't really think Florida tries
to recruit international swimmers,"
senior Shaune Fraser said. "I think
the success that international swim-
mers have at Florida makes others
want to come here."
The Melting Pool
Fraser, the defending NCAA
champion in the 200-yard freestyle
and the 200-yard butterfly, is one of
the many UF swimmers who has
made an impact for the Gators and
his respective country.
Along with being an NCAA re-
cord holder and 20-time All-Ameri-
can, Fraser has already competed in
two Olympic Games and taken on
the role of flag-bearer for his home
country of the Cayman Islands.

of six Olympians and 31 All-Amer-
ica honors, and of the seven Gators
who were awarded All-Southeast-
ern Conference honors this year,
only one of them was born in the
U.S. -proving the enormous im-
pact of foreign-born swimmers at
UF.
"It's a combination of Florida's
good reputation for international
athletes and, even though they're
foreign athletes, they went to high
school in the States," coach Gregg
Troy said.
Of the nine international swim-
mers competing, Shaune Fraser,
Gomez, Pedraza and Pinzon at-
tended high school in the U.S.
After Fraser participated in the
2004 Athens Olympics as a 16-year-
old, he moved from the Cayman
Islands to the U.S. to attend The
Bolles School in Jacksonville.
At the powerhouse swimmingschool, Fraser became a four-time
Florida state champion.
More importantly, Fraser got
invaluable training and experience
he may not have received had he
stayed in the Cayman Islands.
"The swimming facilitiesweren't
that great inthe Cayman Islands and
there wasn't an established coach,"
Fraser said. "My dad figured Bolles
would be a great place to reach my
potential."
One of the other five interna-
tional swimmers who differ in high
school experience from Fraser is his
younger brother Brett.
Unlike Shaune, Brett did not at-
tend Bolles. He stayed in the Cay-
man Islands until he became a
Gator, and like other swimmers
who come straight to UF from for-
eign countries, the younger Fraser
faced a difficult challenge.
"Brett had a hard time adjusting
to the training regiment," associatehead coach Anthony Nesty said.
"The improvements from his fresh-
man year to now are just amazing."
Culture Shock
International swimmers coming
to swim at Florida is nothing new.
As a former Gator, Nesty can re-
late to what both Frasers have gone
through as international swim-
mers.
After competing for Suriname in
the 1984 Olympics, Nesty moved to
the U.S. to attend Bolles.
Nesty, who won the gold medal
inthe 100-meter butterfly at the 1988
Seoul Olympics, became a five-time
NCAA champion at UT.
"It was a shock to my system for
the first four months," Nesty said.
"I went from training 10-12 hours
a week at home to training 20-24
hours per week."
While most of them have been

The UF men's swimming team will be relying on nine swimmers who were born outside the U.S. when it
sends 12 athletes to the NCAA Championships.
'I'successful transitioning to collegiate
swimming, it does take a while for
them to become accustomed to the
team aspect.
"The American athletes are used
to the team concept. The foreigners
are used to training in small teams
where they're the best athletes,"
Nesty said. "The foreigners go to
meets with just a coach and one or
two athletes."
There are no rifts or rivalries
amongst the international swim-
mers or between the international
swimmers and American swim-
mers.
Once the swimmers grasp the
team concept, they do more togeth-
er than just swim in the same pool.
"Swimmers usually hang out
with swimmers. They train togeth-
er, go to meets together and go to
the dining hall together," Nesty
said. "Most of them do a good job
of being part of the team."
Learning in America
So, besides for the swimming,
why do so many international
swimmers come to Florida?
Even though coaches, facilities
and prestige weigh in on an athlete's
school decision, the main reason
they choose UF is its academics.
In fact, that is why, more often
than not, the biggest transition inter-
national swimmers have to make is
with the increased amount of train-
ing and not the cultural barriers.
"They're very well educated,"
Troy said. "That's what makes in-
ternational swimmers want to come
to the States -to compete and get a
good education."
Whether it's Rudolf, a seven-time
recipient of Hungary's Outstanding
in Academics and Sport award, or
Gomez, who picked UF because of
its engineering program as well as
the swimming, international swim-
mers are some of the brightest both
in and out of the water.
Their success cannot be con-
tained by language barriers or inter-
national boundaries, only two lane

Florida edges out Cornell 10-5 in defensive battleI
aff
s'I
UF allowed one second-half goal
By TONI-ANN MILLER
Alligator Writer
From the first draw, it was clear that Flor-
ida's game against Cornell would be a battle
of defenses.
The Gators (6-3, 0-1 American Lacrosse
Conference) stepped up to the challenge and
held the Big Red (2-5, 1-1 Ivy League) to 15
shots, four free-position shots and one sec-
ond-half goal for a 10-5 win on Wednesday in
Gainesville.
Attacker Ashley Bruns led the Gators withthree goals while midfielders Kitty Cullen and
Caroline Chesterman each added two. Mid-
fielder Colby Rhea had the team's only assist.
Cornell struck early, taking a 1-0 lead on a
second-chance goal less than two minutes into
the game. Bruns responded with two scores,
but the Gators' lead was short-lived.
Libby Johnson tied the match with a score
for the Big Red at 23:13 left, but Chesterman
reclaimed the lead for UF a minute later.
"They are a great team and they have some
prolific attackers," UF coach Amanda O'Leary
said. "So I was so pleased with our defense andthe fact that we actually played as a team."
Cullen scored the first goal of the second
half by putting a move on defender Morgan
Hale, causing her to fall and then putting the
ball in the back of the net.
g About two minutes later
Cornell added its only score of
the second half, but UF reeled
off four straight to seal the vic-Lacrosse tory.
UF goalkeeper Cara Can-
ington said after a "sloppy" first half and al-
lowing four goals, the team made its second-
half expectations clear in the locker room at
the break.
"In the locker room, we said, 'Guys, onegoal; that's it,"' Carrington said. "And to be
able to accomplish that goal was kind of excit-
ing but also kind of funny, because we were
like, 'Look, we did it."'
The freshman has given up just 11 goals
in the last three games, helping her team to a
three-game winning streak.
O'Leary said in recent games her team was
able to stick to the game plan of possessing the
ball for most of the 60 minutes, but against the
Big Red, it got away from that strategy.
"Their goalie made some great saves, so
they took us out of our offensive rotation a lit-
tle bit," O'Leary said. "But we regrouped well
in the second half and put the goals in the back
of the net when they were necessary."

Men look to match women's NCAA-title performance
By MATT RUBIN
Alligator Writer
After watching the Florida women's swim-
ming and diving team win the 2010 Women's
NCAA Championships, the Florida men's
team will look to capture a national champi-
onship of its own.
Having a month of training since the
whole team competed at a meet on Feb. 20,
12 Gators will represent UF at the 2010 Men's
NCAA Swimming Championships in Co-
lumbus, Ohio. Beginning competition today,
the Gators will have three days to try to re-
peat what their women counterparts did.Placing second at the Southeastern Con-
ference Championships, the women's team
made a surprising run in West Lafayette,
Ind., to win the national crown last week.
Also placing in second at the SEC Champion-
ships, the men's team hopes to have some of
that same magic with them in Columbus.
"After we watched them win, that just
motivated us immensely," junior Brett Fraser
said."We want to do the same thing as
them."
Leading the way for the Gators will be se-
nior Shaune Fraser and junior Conor Dwyer.
Fraser, the defending NCAA champion in
the 200-yard freestyle and the 200-yard but-
terfly, will try to add on to his 20 All-Ameri-can performances as he swims alongside his
brother for the last time in orange and blue.
Dwyer, swimming in his first NCAA
meet, proved to be an in-
stant success for the Gators.
Transferring from Iowa af-
ter two years, Dwyer was
named the 2010 SEC Men's
Swimmer of the Year and
tied with the older Fraser
for the SEC Commission-
Fraser er's Trophy -given to the
swimmer who contributes
the most points towards his team's overall
score at the meet.
Also competing will be Balazs Gercsak,Roberto Gomez, Marco Loughran, Matt Nor-
ton, Joey Pedraza, Omar Pinzon, Jeff Ray-
mond and Sebastien Rousseau. Roland Ru-
dolf will be serving as the team's alternate.
Senior All-Americans Gomez (two-time),
Pinzon (12-time) and Rudolf (eight-time)
will also be swimming in their last meets as
Gators.
They, along with all of the underclassmen,
will be just as important as Fraser and Dwyer
in orchestrating a great team performance for
UF.
"We're very much like the women's
team," coach Gregg Troy said. "You can't just
have one guy stand out. It's a group competi-
tion."

0A100 THE GATORS WILL HOST USF
TODAY AT 4 P.M.
By GREG LUCA
Alligator Writer
Gators ace Stephanie Brombacher may
get a second opportunity against a lineup
that gave her all she could handle in the
teams' first meeting when USF (14-14) trav-
els to Gainesville to take on No. 6 Florida
(20-3, 4-1 Southeastern Conference) today at
4 p.m.
In Florida's third game of the season,
Brombacher gave up a season-high eight
runs in a 12-8 win over the Bulls.
Although she bounced back from the
rough start and is now 16-3 with a 1.89 ERA,
her outing against USF was the beginning of
what has become a trend for Brombacher.
After notching only one hit the first time
through the lineup, the Bulls pounded out
10 hits and all eight runs the rest of the way.
"They made some adjustments but she
also fatigued herself just a little bit and left
pitches up," UF coach Tim Walton said after
the game.
On the season, Brombacher is holding
opponents to a .194 batting average with an
-* * * * * -ERA less than one the first time through the
order. However, teams are batting .41 points
better, and Brombacher's ERA is more than
a whole run higher once everyone has had a
chance to face her.
If these issues continue, the Gators can
take comfort in the fact that freshman pitch-
er Ensley Gammel has bounced back from a
rough start to her UF career.
Gammel came away from her first two
appearances with a 5.53 ERA, but that num-
ber is down to 2.56 in the 27.1 innings since.
"She's started to develop a little bit of
confidence and has a lot of the team's con-
fidence and the coaching staff's confidence,"
Walton said.
Gammel's biggest issue in the early go-
ing was control, and although she has not
been perfect, her numbers have certainly
improved.
The freshman walked 11 batters in her
first 8.1 innings but has only walked 11 more
in the 25.1 innings since.
The walks have been a major point of
concern for Walton, who has been adamant
about giving the UF defense, which leads
the SEC with a .983 fielding percentage, a
chance to do its job.
"My situation is just throw strikes," Wal-
ton said.
