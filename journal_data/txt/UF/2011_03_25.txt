Montana man sentenced to one year for fraud after mimicking female voice
BOISE, Idaho — A Montana man who 
mimicked a female voice is exchanging his 
ill-gotten Tempur-Pedic mattress for a cot in a federal prison.
The U.S. attorney’s office in Idaho says 
60-year-old Ricky Vaughn Barry of Hamil-ton, Mont., was sentenced Wednesday to a year and a day in prison for impersonating his ex-wife when speaking to company rep-resentatives.
The calls to open a line of credit and or -der a $4,000 bed and sheets were recorded.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Mitch-
ell in Boise said the case against the former Coeur d’Alene resident developed after his ex-wife pulled her credit report and found accounts used to purchase the bed and a laptop.
The federal charges did not include the 
laptop purchase, but both items were sold to help pay just over $7,700 in restitution.

GAINESVILLE CITY COMMISSION
By MEREDITH RUTLAND
Alligator Writer
They knew they’d have to face off one day.
The former presidents of the UF College Demo-
crats and Republicans looked across the aisle and saw future competitors.
Now, the day is almost here when Eric Con-
rad and Bryan Griffin, both 23 and equipped with UF political science degrees, go head-to head in the Gainesville City Commission run-off election. While they aren’t running, they said their hearts are fully invested in race.
“His win or loss,” said Griffin, campaign man-
ager for District 3 candidate Rob Zeller, “becomes my win or loss.”
Their days are a series of to-do lists.Each wakes up around 8 a.m.Griffin said he likes to get as much sleep as pos-
sible before his first UF law class, so he skips break-fast to give him more time.
“It might not be the healthiest,” 
he said, “but it works for me.” 
Conrad’s alarm blares 
Killswitch Engage or another metal band. Breakfast is toast with peanut butter.
“I wish it was something 
healthy,” he said.
Then, Griffin goes to class, and 
Conrad goes to Susan Bottcher’s 
campaign headquarters — her house.
After Griffin’s class, he meets up with Zeller.Recent grads work behind the scenes of local races

Protestors stand in front 
of the White House, signs in 
hand bearing messages to stop 
the war and let peace reign.
When they refuse to leave, 
telling authorities they intend to stay there until the troops 
come home, they’re taken 
away by force in handcuffs.
This was how Scott Camil spent last weekend.
Camil, 64, is a lifelong ac-
tivist who’s seen his share of

the most important responsi-bility an American can have.

NEW ORLEANS — After 40 minutes, the Gators 
were trapped in familiar territory: tied with BYU in 
the NCAA Tournament and heading to overtime af-
ter a missed shot by Chandler Parsons. 
But this time around, history did not repeat it-
self. 
Behind a monstrous effort from senior forward 
Alex Tyus, the No. 2-seed Gators (29-7) notched 
an 83-74 victory in a Sweet 16 matchup against the third-seeded Cougars (32-5) on Thursday in New Orleans. 
Florida’s balanced scoring and dominant defen-
sive effort against BYU senior Jimmer Fredette pro-pelled UF into a Saturday matchup against Butler in the Elite Eight.   
“We’re happy to advance, happy to be playing on 
Saturday,” UF coach Billy Donovan said. “It’s been so rewarding for me to see them make the journey they’ve made to this point.”
Tyus played inspired basketball for 32 minutes, 
laying out for loose balls and crashing the glass for every rebound. 
He finished with 19 points and a game-high 17 
boards, including five points and his second three-pointer of the season in the opening 2:36, all on the biggest stage of his life. 
“It means a lot, just being able to come out here, 
play to the best of my ability tonight and help the team win in many different ways,” Tyus said.  
Tyus’ persistent effort in the final minutes of reg-
ulation carried into overtime. 
He got off to a strong start in the extra period, 
grabbing an offensive rebound after UF’s first shot and converting the putback to give the Gators a lead they never relinquished. 
“When he has a lot of activity and is really fly-
ing around, because of his athleticism, he has a great ability to impact the game,” Donovan said. “He’s a great kid, and he worked hard.” UF bounces BYU in OT

Season nine “American Idol” winner Lee 
DeWyze will perform at the Phillips Center 
for Performing Arts on Monday at 7:30 p.m. 
The free concert, sponsored by IRHA and 
Student Government Productions, is a part of IRHAPalooza, a concert put on every year during Residence Hall Week.
DeWyze was voted America’s Idol in 
May after being one of two contestants to never land in the “bottom three”  — the three contestants with the fewest number of votes for the week — on elimination days. 
The paint-salesman-turned-recording-
artist’s debut album, “Live It Up,” sold more than 100,000 copies in the U.S.
DeWyze will be paid $12,000 for his per -
formance.
John Kelly, director of IRHAPalooza, said 
he chose DeWyze because he is an up-and-coming artist within IRHA’s price range and because he just won “American Idol.”
“I think it’s going to be really cool five 
years from now, when Lee is on every ra-dio station, to know we brought him here to UF,” he said. 
This year’s concert will be indoors with 
1,700 seats available. 
Tickets will be available to students start-
ing at noon Monday at the Phillips Center box office. After 6:30 p.m., the remaining tickets will be open and free to the public. 
Opening for DeWyze is Michael J., a local 
artist Kelly found at Applebee’s while sing-ing karaoke. 
Although the concert is free, everyone is 
encouraged to bring canned food to donate.Idol winner Lee DeWyze

For Gainesville residents who missed 
out on the fun of drive-in dining for the 
past three years, it’s time to rejoice.
Sonic Drive-In, 2162 NW 39th Ave., 
reopened Thursday from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. after closing in 2008. The store 
will continue limited hours, 8 a.m. to 10 p.m., through the weekend before start-
ing its regular business hours from 6 a.m. to midnight on Monday, according 
to George Didericks, partnering man-ager.
Didericks said the limited hours help 
the staff members work out the basic operating procedures for the restau-
rant and help them run more efficiently 
when they begin normal hours.
Although the website is still under construction, Didericks said the site should be running by the time the store 
celebrates its official grand opening on April 16.
Eric Convenido, a second year UF 
student, said he was really excited about the store reopening.
“I used to go to Sonic after every 
drum lesson in Orlando,” he said. “I 
was pretty upset when I got up here 
and they were closed.”
Adam Carswell, a shift manager at 
Sonic, said in an email the location will 
feature a happy hour 
every day from 2 
p.m. to 4 p.m., which has been popular at 
other Sonic Drive-Ins.
He said the Sonic at 1910 N. Main St. 
isn’t ready for reopening yet but should be opening up soon.Sonic Drive-In reopens

“I think it’s going to be really cool 
five years from now, when Lee is 
on every radio station, to know 
we brought him here to UF.”
John Kelly
Director of IRHAPaloozaAroundGainesvilleThe next hours are filled with posters, 
price evaluations and phone calls.
The days are long, and the downtime is 
short, so each man has developed his own 
method of coping with the breakneck speed 
that comes with campaigning.
When Conrad comes home, he walks into 
his one-story suburban home, greets his wife, 
Danni, and makes a beeline for his chair.
He might read or watch TV , but for five 
minutes he doesn’t say a word.
“It’s kind of an unplugging period,” Con-
rad said.
For Griffin, his zoo-like rescue pets are the 
cure to a stressful day.
Over the years, Griffin, who also majored 
in classical history, hatched an emu, Icarus, from an egg he bought on Craigslist, cared for a pig, Nefertiti, and grew attached to a once-abused skunk, Odysseus.
He’s given most of his pets to friends, farms and his parents. Odysseus is his most recent rescue, and Griffin sees him every day. 
“He is my joy and my relief,” he said.They also have their support groups.Griffin said when he was running for a 
seat on the county Soil and Water Conserva-tion Board, his dad drove from Tampa to help him put signs at all 80 polling locations in Gainesville. 
Conrad said his wife understands how 
much time it takes to run the campaign. She’s 
seen him through much more, including his 
UF Student Government involvement and his work on Mayor Craig Lowe’s campaign. 
The two started dating in seventh grade.Griffin said he sees himself as a family 
man, but he hasn’t found the right woman yet.
“My friends joke around I’m looking for a 
first lady,” he said.
They got to where they are now through 
UF political clubs. But they didn’t start out with political aspirations.Conrad came to UF with dreams of be-
coming a teacher. Griffin wanted to be a po-litical reporter.
Along the way, Conrad got involved with 
the 2008 Barack Obama election campaign, and Griffin helped start a conservative news-paper. Conrad was the press secretary for Student Government, and Griffin was the Gator Growl spokesman.
Then, they found their respective political 
party organizations and rose to the rank of 
president.
“That time of my life 
was just unforgettable,” Griffin said.
Conrad agreed. He 
said he will never forget the time Michelle Obama wished him “Happy birthday.”
He was sitting inside the Hippodrome 
Theatre, waiting to introduce her to a crowd during early voting in 2008. He reviewed his 
speech for half an hour.
Then, there was a tap on his shoulder. He 
looked up, and there was Michelle Obama.“The worst part was I kind of didn’t see 
her coming,” he said.
He was stunned and forgot his speech. He 
memorized it again in 10 minutes.
“It was a big day,” Conrad said. “I was 
very happy.”
Although their days are consumed with 
the election for now, it will inevitably end.
From there, their goals diverge.
Conrad said he wants to get a master’s 
in political campaigning from UF or George Washington University. He is waiting on the 
admission results.
Griffin, who wears a presidential seal 
necklace carved from a 50-cent coin that he 
bought at a Medieval festival, has aspirations of becoming a senator or president of the United States.
“I’m not going to limit my own dreams 
and ambitions,” he said.
Until then, they are the men behind the 
scenes.
“I’ve still got a race to run,” Conrad said.FRIDAY, MARCH 25, 2011 n ALLIGATOR, 5

Political activist Scott Camil recounts protest and arrest 
stories in his home office Wednesday.
He helped form Vietnam Veterans Against the War
poor household, Camil was brought 
up with the mindset that he would join the armed forces once he gradu-
ated from high school. 
He enlisted in the Marine Corps 
in 1969. 
He looked forward to fighting for 
democracy in Vietnam.
He soon learned that war is never 
romantic.
“As soon as you see your friends 
being killed and wounded, the real-ity of war grabs your attention,” he 
said. “In reality, you’re no longer fighting for politics; you’re fighting for each other.”
After two tours of duty, Camil re-
turned to Florida and enrolled at UF, where he earned his degree in phi-losophy. 
It was in Gainesville that he de-
veloped his identity as a political ac-tivist and organizer.
He said his professors helped him 
realize what  he’d been fighting for 
in Vietnam had been a lie.
“We were used,” he said. “We 
went there to defend democracy, but we were there to thwart democ-
racy.”
He helped form Vietnam Veterans 
Against the War to help give a voice to those who’ve served in the anti-
war movement.
In 1972, he and a group of others 
planned to protest against both the 
Democratic and Republican conven-
tions to let their voices be heard, but 
they would never get that chance.
Before the Republican Conven-
tion in Miami took place, Camil and seven others, better known as the 
Gainesville Eight, were arrested for 
conspiracy to disrupt the Republican National Convention. It turned out that Camil’s group 
had been infiltrated by government agitators, placed there to feed Camil false information and take down their plans from the inside-out.
The agents told Camil that the 
government planned to attack the protestors and say it was the protes-tors who started the violence after -
ward, so Camil drew up a defense plan for such a scenario. 
Those plans were then used to 
charge the Gainesville Eight with conspiracy.
When the jury came back with a 
“not guilty” verdict, he and his fel-low defendants hugged, cheered and cried in joy while the prosecution 
hung their heads.
Camil has never relented in his 
quest for peace and justice and con-
tinues to be an active demonstrator. 
He was arrested March 20, along 
with more than 100 others, for pro-testing the wars in Iraq and Afghani-stan. 
He is already planning future pro-
tests here in Gainesville.
For him, it’s the American thing 
to do.PERSON , from page 1

Obama negatively reshaping America
As President Obama’s approval ratings continue to 
fall and he amasses more enemies on both sides of the aisle in response to his invasion of Libya, I am 
reminded of perhaps the most telling and haunting mo-ment of the 2008 presidential election coverage.
Three days before the election, Tom Brokaw sat down 
for an interview with Charlie Rose on PBS. Both men were supportive of Obama and had treated him to favorable news coverage over the course of the campaign.
In the interview, however, both men reached a startling 
realization. Neither of them knew who Barack Obama ac-tually was.
What is his worldview? What are his stances on foreign 
policy? Who are his advisers? What books has he read? 
Who are his heroes?
As each of the questions they posed was answered with 
an increasingly dense black hole of uncertainty, Brokaw 
stated the inevitable conclusion as the interview drew to a close: “There’s a lot about him we don’t know.”
It was true. Nobody knew a lot about Barack Obama, 
in large part because journalists such as Brokaw and Rose were too swept up in the hysteria to perform the investi-gative work that would have answered such questions.
Obama had run a masterfully crafted campaign on the 
platform of hope and change. Voters across the country were projecting their image of an ideal leader onto this young, fresh, energetic senator from Illinois.
Democrats believed he would end war and poverty. 
Republicans believed he would end racial tension. Be-cause Obama revealed so little about his actual policies and positions, voters were left to fill in the blanks for themselves.
Once elected, Obama’s strategy of ambiguity was car -
ried into his presidency. He set out to undertake various reforms and projects, yet the motives behind his agenda remained a mystery.
However, as it became clear that socialized medicine was being disguised as health care reform and government takeovers were being disguised as economic stimulus, Republicans and inde-pendents began to bail on Obama 
and regret their support of his cam-
paign.
During the gulf oil spill, many 
Democrats also began to question his leadership as he delayed re-
sponse for so many weeks after the crisis began. More recently, Obama’s failure to close Guantanamo Bay and his invasion of Libya have Democrats across the country ripping their Obama stickers off their Toyota Priuses.
The simple fact is that Obama’s ideology does not 
entirely align with traditional tenets of either side of the aisle. A cursory investigation of Obama’s role models and mentors reveals more anarchists and communists than Republicans and Democrats, and anyone who wishes to think critically and objectively must wonder if such influ-ences have shaped his ideology.
The average American, whether Republican or Dem-
ocrat, believes in the exceptional status of this country 
that is commonly called the “American Dream.” Obama, 
through his famous “worldwide apology tour,” his actions and his speeches, has demonstrated his perspective to be significantly different, and his policies are reshaping this country into a form that most Americans do not want.
Administration officials are scrambling to relay 
Obama’s plan to the American people in a form that makes sense, yet more and more stages of the plan are becoming increasingly odious to all Americans. The more 
people realize that Obama’s endgame does not align with 
their vision of America, the more perilous Obama’s politi-cal future will be.

For the first time in U.S. history, we have an openly gay 
presidential candidate. 
And he’s a Republican. We were definitely scratching our heads over this piece 
of information, but we’ve been waiting for a while to see 
a viable moderate Republican candidate. After all, the up-
coming election could see some of the most conservative candidates we’ve had in a long time. For braving the in-evitable eyebrow-raising of his own party, we’re giving a thanks-for-throwing-a-much-needed-hat-in-the-ring 
LAUREL to Fred Karger. We’re hoping his party doesn’t 
throw him under the bus along the way.
In that same line of inspiring anomalies, we’re asking 
you to think back to January and the biggest news story of 
that month, the Arizona shooting. 
Contrary to the primary reports, U.S. Rep. Gabrielle 
Giffords survived a gunshot to the head. Now, she’s beat 
the odds and is even singing. Her story leads us to throw-ing  congratulations-on-finding-some-light-in-all-the-
darkness LAURELS at Giffords, her family and her doc-
tors. Watching her slowly heal can help her state and the nation do the same.
While Gabby’s heading out of the woods, Barry’s trek-
king deeper into them. 
We can count very few people satisfied with the presi-
dent’s decisions about Libya over the past week. On the left, they’re complaining that the U.S. is overstepping its bounds, while those on the right are griping that it’s too 
little, too late. We’re jumping on the bandwagon, but we 
just think he should have been a bit more transparent with his decision to take action. So we’re throwing a care-to-clue-us-in-on-your-thinking-buddy? DART at President 
Obama for keeping us in the dark. At least let us know 
what our goals are, jeez.
We also want to know exactly what went down in Cri-
ser Hall on Wednesday.
 From what we understand, a Humans vs. Zombies 
player was carrying an orange and clear Nerf gun when a UF employee called the cops, thinking it was a firearm. How do you make that mistake? We suppose that kind of debacle is the reason for the policies the game has in 
place. With that in mind, we’re throwing you’ve-got-to-
be-freaking-kidding-me DARTS at both the UF employee who called the cops and the armed student, both unnamed.  Can’t we go back to the good ol’ days when eating brains didn’t involve squad cars?
Speaking of the days of yore, do you remember the toys 
you played with as a kid? 
We all have our favorites, but our parents’ collectively 
most-hated toy is making itself at home in Winter Haven in October. We’re giving a they’re-not-just-for-stabbing-parental-feet-anymore LAUREL to Legoland Florida for catering to our inner child and making our fathers wince 
with painful memories.
Now go get some fresh air, Gators.

The popular revolution surging through-
out Libya has been under a spotlight in the U.S., as allied warplanes and cruise 
missiles have recently begun to aid anti-gov-ernment rebels in their fight to remove dicta-
tor Muammar Gadhafi from power. But this 
incredible uprising is just one of many inten-sifying pro-democracy, anti-autocratic move-ments driven by young people across the Middle East.
The revolt in Libya, the most censored 
country in the Middle East and North Africa according to the 2009 Freedom of the Press In-dex, is an illumination of the vigorously grow-
ing opposition fueled by youth who, through 
access to social media, have seen how the rest of the world lives and want it for them-selves. They want the freedom to make their own choices and the freedom to have their own voices.The immobilizing wall of silence was first broken in the Tunisia revolution. The popular uprising that ousted the nation’s leader Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali was the first democratic revolt in the modern Arab world and a catalyst for the rest of the Middle East to press for reform in a region dominated by 
authoritative regimes. The oppressed citizens 
of other Arab and North African nations did indeed begin to respond — several countries are currently fighting against the corruption and nepotism they have lived with their whole lives and are realizing that political freedom and economic reform comes from democracy.
Following their neighbors in Tunisia, in 
January protesters in Egypt demanded the 
overthrow of Egyptian president Hosni Muba-
rak and his regime. After weeks of popular protest and pressure, Mubarak resigned from office in February . A record number of voters turned out in Egypt approving constitutional amendments to secure a free and fair demo-cratic system.In Yemen last 
week, President Ali Abdullah Saleh, a determined U.S. ally 
in the fight against terrorism, declared a state 
of emergency and dismissed his cabinet after 
government-linked forces killed more than 40 unarmed protesters. On Monday , news came about of several top army commanders and one of Yemen’s key tribal leaders having sided with the protesters.
And that’s not it. Opposition leaders in 
Bahrain were arrested after troops disbanded thousands of protestors that were occupying 
the central square of Manama. The king called 
for a three-month state of emergency . In Saudi Arabia, Sunni Muslims sent troops to mollify the mainly Shiite upheaval in bordering Bah-rain. King Abdullah offered more than $100 billion in added benefits to citizens following relentless protests in Riyadh.Let’s take a look at Syria. Protest-
ers set fire to a headquarters of the ruling Baath Party — a raging indication of dis-sent in one of the region’s most authoritar -
ian states. And now Libyan people pouring across Tunisia’s border are being offered food and assistance from their neighbors.  
It’s obvious now that Libya is but one part of a 
remarkable wave of revolt in the Arab world. 
The Arab people, mainly the youth, are no longer sitting paralyzed under oppression, re-stricted by religious theocracies.
The U.S. should continue supporting the 
dissidents in Libya and the quest for freedom in future autocratic governments. Middle Eastern dictator-run governments are finally changing — an extraordinary step in the mod-
ern Arab world. And the United States being a 
part of it is a tremendous thing.
Raquel Woodruff is a student at New Y ork 
University.
Middle Eastern youth now fighting for their political voiceUWire
Raquel Woodruff
UWireWe’re living in a dark time.
There isn’t a student across the state of Florida 
who hasn’t felt the impact of the economic crisis. 
Our Bright Futures scholarships that we were guaranteed in 
high school don’t go as far as they used to. Many of the aca-
demic programs that brought us to the UF in the first place are 
getting slashed left and right. High unemployment and a soft job market have most of us apprehensive about our plans af-ter graduation. And now UF’s administration is talking about increasing tuition by 30 percent and implementing a block tu-ition system that would force students to pay for classes they don’t take.
This is our reality, and it’s about to get worse if we don’t 
stand up.
Right now, our Florida state government is debating our 
fate in Tallahassee. Our extremist governor, Rick Scott, and his legislature are proposing $1.75 billion in cuts to public education, along with $100 million in cuts to Bright Futures, which the state began funding when the lottery couldn’t pay for it alone.
Students aren’t the only victims of 
Rick Scott’s budget cuts. For decades, 
Florida’s state legislature has targeted our teachers, firefight-
ers, police officers, nurses and other public servants by attack-
ing their unions. Now,  Scott wants to deal public employees a death blow and take away their right to collectively bargain for fair contracts altogether.
When Scott says that he needs to make these devastating 
cuts to solve Florida’s budget crisis, you need to remember two facts: One, we don’t have a budget crisis in Florida. We have a constitutional amendment that prevents us from defi-cit spending. We don’t have a looming public debt like other 
states.
And two, students didn’t crash the economy. Gainesville’s 
courageous firefighters didn’t force people out of their homes 
through foreclosures. The hardworking teachers at Eastside High School didn’t rip off the country through Ponzi schemes. And the pensions of the nurses at the local Veterans Affairs hospital, earned through years of public service, are not the reason for the country’s multi-trillion-dollar debt.
Billionaire Gov. Rick Scott says we have a budget crisis, 
cuts taxes for corporations and the wealthy and then expects to balance the budget on the backs of the middle class.
Enough is enough. We didn’t create this crisis; it was the 
banks, the corporations and the politicians they hand-picked.
The people of Wisconsin are fighting back. The people of 
Ohio are fighting back. And today at 5:30 p.m. on the Plaza of the Americas at UF, Gainesville will join 12 other cities across the state of Florida and fight back.
Come out and demand a Florida state government for the 
people, not against them. Visit our website, fightbackflorida.com for more information.

UF senior second baseman Josh Adams said he expects South Carolina to be “a little bitter” about the last time the two met, when the Gators beat the Gamecocks to secure a regular-season SEC title.
 By TOM GREEN
Alligator Writer
tgreen@alligator.org
The last time Florida squared 
off against South Carolina, the 
Southeastern Conference title was 
on the line.
That series ended with the 
Gators in a dogpile on the infield 
of Carolina Stadium, celebrating 
a regular-season SEC champion-
ship. 
When No. 4 South Carolina 
(16-4, 2-1 SEC), the defending Col-lege World Series champion, visits 
McKethan Stadium tonight at 7 to 
open a three-game series against No. 1 Florida (20-2, 3-0 SEC), the stakes won’t be nearly as high.
But that won’t take away from 
the intensity of the weekend.
“For us to go up there and do 
what we did in South Carolina, they’re probably a little bitter,” second baseman Josh Adams said. 
“In the end, they did get the final 
say, so for them to come down here, they’re going to be ready to go.
“It’s going to be a tough se-
ries.”
The toughest part for Florida will be shutting down South Car -
olina junior center fielder Jackie Bradley Jr. 
The junior center fielder was 
named the Most Outstanding 
Player in Omaha, Neb., where the 
Gamecocks took home their first CWS title last June.
Bradley was the sparkplug for 
South Carolina’s offense during its title run, going 10 for 29 at the plate, drove in nine runs, scored five and hit a home run in the 
Gamecocks’ seven CWS games.
The center fielder was also the 
difference for South Carolina in its 
lone victory against Florida last 
year, when the Gamecocks avoid-
ed a sweep with an 11-6 win the day after the Gators clinched the SEC title. 
While Bradley hit 4 for 8 the 
first two games of the series, the 
Gators’ pitching staff limited his 
production, as he had no RBIs or runs scored, struck out three times and stranded three men on base. 
In South Carolina’s lone win of the 
series, he went 2 for 4 with four RBIs, a home run and a double.
“He’s a really good hitter,” Florida to host defending CWS champion South Carolina

Not much looked different Thursday.
Just like last season, Florida 
and BYU were forced to play into over -
time as the two teams fought it out for a chance to survive in the NCAA Tour -
nament.
But don’t let your eyes deceive you. 
This Gators team is drastically differ -
ent the one that lost to the Cougars in 2010.
Florida was left defeated and 
searching for answers after last sea-son’s heartbreaking loss.
But that was then, and this is now.The Gators came out on top Thurs-
day to gain revenge against the Cou-gars and punch their ticket to the Elite Eight.
Yes, you read that right. The Elite 
Eight.The same 
starting five that 
was content with 
just making the NCAA Tourna-ment last season is only one win 
away from the Fi-

The group’s 
growth was evi-
dent in Thursday’s victory. 
After an uneven first half that be-
gan with some hot shooting from UF and ended with an alarming number of missed three-pointers, the Gators 
did something only elite teams could 
do on a stage as big as the Sweet 16 — they adjusted.

A perplexing season for the Florida 
women’s basketball team ended in a famil-
iar and heartbreaking fashion Thursday night. 
Ahead by as many as 17 points in the 
second half, UF appeared to be cruising 
into its first Women’s National Invitation 
Tournament round of eight since the field 
expanded to 64 teams.
But turnovers and poor shooting trans-
formed a near rout into an overtime loss, as 
the Gators (20-15) fell 81-77 to the 49ers (26-
9) in Halton Arena in Charlotte, N.C. 
“Our turnovers were the story of the 
game,” Florida coach Amanda Butler said. “We certainly scored enough points. …We just coughed the ball up way too much.”
Florida jumped out to an early 18-8 lead 
on the strength of freshman Jaterra Bonds’ three-point shooting. The guard started 4 
of 4 from beyond the arc, scoring 16 points on 6-of-10 shooting by halftime, 
and as a team, Florida 
seemed unable to miss.
UF shot 50 percent in 
the first half, making five 
threes to Charlotte’s zero and went into the locker room up by 12 at 43-31. 
The Gators scored the first five points out 
of the break to extend their lead to a game-Gators squander 17-point 
lead in season-ending loss

UF SOFTBALL
By STEPHEN SHEEHAN
Alligator Writer 
Heading into its toughest match-
up of the year, No. 2 Florida could 
once again be without ace Stephanie 
Brombacher. 
UF’s senior starter hasn’t pitched 
since the Gators (30-1, 7-0 Southeast-ern Conference) beat Ball State 21-0 
on March 12 due to bicep tender -
ness, and her status for this week-
end’s series against No. 3 Georgia (23-4, 5-3 SEC) is up in the air. 
“Mechanically, she has a lot of is-
sues because of the injury,” UF coach 
Tim Walton said. “Before it was a 
shoulder, then it was an elbow, and now it’s the bicep. 
“It’s a day-to-day process to get 
her back out there.” 
Walton does not plan to throw 
Brombacher into the mix if she is not 
at or near 100 percent, but he did not 
fully rule out her return this week-end. 
Although he hopes she will be 
available, Walton plans on using 
a combination of Hannah Rogers 
and Ensley Gammel to try to shut down the Bulldogs’ high-powered offense.
The Bulldogs were the top-
ranked team in the nation before getting swept by current No. 1 Ala-bama last weekend, and they boast five .300 hitters, including Megan 
Wiggins, who leads Georgia with a 
.449 clip. 
However, Rogers has displayed 
an innate ability to step up on the 
big stage. 
The freshman 
picked up wins against then-No. 2 UCLA at the 
Cathedral City 
Classic in early March and won five consecutive 
games in five days last week against Mississippi State and Ole Miss. 
“A lot of times, freshmen get rat-
tled easily in adversity, but she stays true to herself,” left fielder Kelsey Bruder said. “She knows what her game plan is, and she sticks to it. Her 
poise is beyond her years.” 
Facing an aggressive offense like 
Georgia’s will require Rogers to be 
unpredictable and make use of all 
her pitches, Walton said. 
Despite an up-and-down season 
in the circle, Gammel will be count-
ed on to take some of the workload off Rogers. 
The sophomore was solid in her 
last outing, throwing two hitless in-nings in UF’s 11-3 win against Ole Miss, but she is still in search of 
more consistency . 
“For a 10-day period last year, Ensley was the best pitcher in Amer -
ica,” Walton said. “Her command 
hasn’t been sharp. She needs a more 
consistent release point. She’s a 
ground-ball pitcher and needs to use her defense behind her.” 
Whether it’s Brombacher, Rogers 
or Gammel in the circle, it will be the offense’s responsibility to pick up the slack as UF hosts the Bulldogs today at 5 p.m.
“Ensley’s definitely going to 
be key to the series, but more than that, it’s a challenge to our offense,” Bruder said. “We want to provide security for our pitching staff. It’s a 
lot easier to pitch when you’re up by 
five.”

49ers capitalize on UF’s turnovers
high 17 points, and the 49ers didn’t claim their 
first lead until midway through the second half, when Jessica Johnson drained a three-pointer to 
make it 53-51. 
Charlotte’s Shannon McCallum, who was 
limited to four points in the first, exploded for 21 in the final 25 minutes, including multiple 
game-changing shots. 
Trailing 69-67 with less than two minutes 
left in regulation, McCallum knocked down her third three of the half, putting Charlotte back on top. 
Bonds missed a look from long range on the 
other end, and McCallum took it the distance to give the 49ers a 72-69 lead with 1:02 remaining.
Bonds, who finished with a career-high 23 
points, answered right back with a three of her own, forcing overtime. Jordan Jones made 
a step-back three from the top of the key with 
1:18 left in the extra period to give Florida a 77-74 lead.
But then, the Gators collapsed. McCallum pulled up quickly from outside to 
tie the game at 77, then Jennifer Hailey forced a turnover on the ensuing inbounds play , giving 
Charlotte an easy layup and a two-point lead.  
Down two, Florida still had a chance, but 
under pressure from Charlotte, Bonds dribbled 
the ball off her foot, and the 49ers took posses-
sion. McCallum then found Kendria Holmes all 
alone for an easy layup, putting the game out of reach with 18 seconds left. 
“That was the nail — that put the nail in 
them right there,” McCallum said. 
Charlotte scored 27 points 
off Florida giveaways and outscored the Gators 42-28 in the paint. But the story , as Butler pointed out, was 
the turnovers. Florida had 22 
to Charlotte’s 12, while the 49ers dished 22 assists to the 
Gators’ 11. 
“A month ago, they would have packed it 
in at some point and gotten too down on them-selves and thought they couldn’t do it,” Char -
lotte coach Karen Aston said. 
Asked what sparked the Charlotte come-
back, Aston had a succinct reply.
“It was a lot of Shannon McCallum, wasn’t 
it?”W-HOOPS , from page 13
catcher Mike Zunino said. “He gets 
them going. ... He makes stuff hap-pen for them.”
Bradley has done the same for 
South Carolina this year, batting .311 and leading the team with 20 RBIs and six home runs. He had his 
200th career hit Wednesday night 
in a 17-8 win against Rhode Island.
If Florida hopes to limit Brad-
ley’s production this weekend, it will need a strong effort from 
southpaw Brian Johnson, who will 
toe the rubber for Florida in the se-ries opener. 
Johnson was Bradley’s teammate 
on the US Collegiate National Team over the summer, and the two have remained friends.
But Johnson said he didn’t get 
many opportunities to figure out how to pitch to him effectively, and he plans on going after the left-handed batter tonight.
Zunino, Johnson’s batterymate, 
hopes keeping Bradley in check re-sults in a domino effect throughout the rest of the Gamecocks’ lineup.
“We just got to focus on him and 
hopefully the rest of the lineup and try to get out of innings with lim-ited damage,” Zunino said. 
“Bradley is a great player, one 
of the best hitters in the country,” 
UF coach Kevin O’Sullivan added. 
“But he’s got a great supporting cast around him as well.”Bradley earns Gators’ respect

Women's
Bask etballFredette, the nation’s leading scorer, 
eclipsed the 30-point mark for the second 
year in a row against Florida, this time going 
off for 32 one year after dropping 37 points.
But thanks to a strong defensive effort 
from guards Kenny Boynton and Scottie Wil-bekin, he did so on 11-of-29 shooting, includ-ing 3 of 15 from beyond the arc.
“[Boynton] did an unbelievable job of 
limiting his open looks,” Parsons said. “He 
had 32 points, but I think it was a great job that we did defensively.”
Boynton was playing just five days after 
spraining his left ankle against UCLA in the second round, but he showed no signs of pain. 
The sophomore guard worked around 
screens and shadowed Fredette for nearly all of the 40 minutes he was on the floor. 
Fredette did everything he could to will 
BYU to the win, controlling the ball and tak-
ing most of the Cougars’ final shots.  
But the Gators harassed the senior 
throughout, and he never found his stroke.
Just as important as the defense on Fre-
dette was Florida’s ability to guard his team-mates, as no other Cougar scored in double-
digits. 
“That’s the biggest thing when you look 
at the stat sheet,” Donovan said. “I thought that was going to be really important.”
Florida got off to a hot shooting start and 
a 20-10 lead, hitting eight consecutive shots following a Boynton miss to open the game. 
But UF’s outside shot cooled consider -
ably, and the Gators struggled to get the ball 
inside against a BYU zone 
that double-teamed nearly 
every pass to the post. 
Late in the game, the 
Gators went back to Tyus 
and the powerful interior 
scoring that got them to 
this point in the season, as Florida’s frontcourt play-
ers scored the team’s final 14 points in regu-
lation. 
With the exception of senior center Ver -
non Macklin, who finished with nine points, 
all of Florida’s starters scored in double dig-
its. Boynton had 17 points, Erving Walker 
added 16 and Parsons scored 16 while grab-bing nine rebounds and dishing out seven assists.FRIDAY, MARCH 25, 2011 n ALLIGATOR, 15
shots from deep, and the plan 
worked brilliantly in the first half. But UF came out of the locker room 
with a new, effective method to at-
tack the defense.
Instead of walking it up the court 
and quickly firing threes, the Gators 
got into their sets a little quicker in 
order to establish Vernon Macklin and Alex Tyus, who combined for 19 points after the first half despite scoring just nine in the opening 20 
minutes.
This wouldn’t have happened 
in years past. Florida was too stub-born then.
The Gators executed their half-
court offense to perfection when it 
mattered, scoring 15 points in five minutes of overtime.
And they never let a pro-BYU 
crowd or one of Jimmer’s patented scoring outbursts deter them.
“We just know how to stay fo-cused and stay in the moment,” UF guard Erving Walker said. “They 
made a run at the end of the second 
half, but we stayed together.”
This type of basketball hasn’t 
been played since Joakim Noah, Al 
Horford, Corey Brewer and Tau-
rean Green were running the show and winning titles. 
And it has the 2011 Gators in a 
spot that group was all too familiar 
with — inching closer to making 
history.
Overcoming BYU, the demon 
that has haunted Florida for more 
than a year, is important for the 
Gators. 
Growth can only be measured 
by comparing something against a constant variable. 
The Cougars played that role 
Thursday, and the Gators’ maturity was evident.
Now, Florida is just a win over 
Butler away from the Final Four.

“How much will he 
pay?”
Dom says, “Half 
now, and $1,000 a week until the debt disappears.”
“Cool. We split the first 
$20,000, and then $500 a week 
each until he’s square. When?” 
Dom says, “I’m meeting him 
at 8 p.m. Friday in a Westchester 
park.”
I feel like a football bet I’d 
given up on just pulled off a Hail Mary pass.  
The risks of sending Dom were 
plain.
If a deadbeat can’t pay, Dom 
might panic him to scream, “Help, police!” 
Karl can pay. Karl’s beaten us for $50 large in 
two weeks. He has our $40,000.
Dominick’s volatility presents 
another danger. 
Like the Kraken, once loose, 
God knows how much havoc ac-companies him. 
This mission requires forceful 
diplomacy. 
If he harms Karl, or worse, we 
become accessories to murder — jackpot: game, set, and match. 
But he has to get the money. I wore blinders when it came 
to Dom’s collection methods. With the lights on, I’d see the roaches.
The office has bugs. I don’t 
need to know their habits.
n n n
One collection method “wise 
guys” use is good thug, bad thug. One brute spews hardball.
“The boss don’t care about 
the money no more. This guy’s a thief. Let’s just shoot this prick and go home.”
The reasonable monster says, 
“Don’t shoot him right away. Let’s talk. Maybe it’s not too 
late.”
They throw the deadbeat into 
the trunk of their car and drive 
around for an hour or so. 
Meanwhile, the poor bastard 
in the trunk is dying.
They stop for coffee. Once the car parks, the dead-
beat thinks his fate’s decided — 
death by anticipation. 
Twenty minutes later, the car 
restarts. The process repeats. 
When the car stops, he dies again.
After opening the trunk an 
hour later, the victim’s soiled pants say he’s ready to talk busi-ness. 
The squabble continues. “I say we just kill him.”“I don’t want to kill another 
guy this month.” 
Honest concern accompanies 
the ensuing plea: 
“Hey pal, why don’t you just 
pay the money?”
n n n
Friday night, the reckoning 
comes. No word from Dominick as 8 p.m. comes and goes; 9 and 10 p.m. pass, still silence.
At 11 p.m., Dominick’s clear 
concise voice carries catastroph-ic news, “I’m in jail on $100,000 
bond. Come get me out.”  
I’m frantic. One hundred 
large, where do I get it? My main 
partner, Blinky, is vacationing in Italy. My other partner, Red, is 
broke. He’s an insane gambler. 
My cash has been wisely invested in booze, broads and drugs. If Domin-
ick talks, my partner and 
I lose every-
thing.
F r i d a y 
night pres-
ents another 
problem. 
The court 
system in 
New York shuts down on week-
ends. 
I have to get him out before he 
gets pissed. He’s a stand-up guy 
and won’t rollover, but I have to 
do the right thing. 
I have $50 large from the busi-
ness.  I can bang out $30 large in 
credit cards. Maybe I can reach out to a shylock for the other 
$20,000. 
But the standard street rate is 
three points.
That translates to $30 weekly 
in vig for every $1,000 you bor -
row. 
Twenty large means juice is 
$600 per week with nothing com-
ing off the top. 
I can’t worry about juice.I have to get Dominick out.
n n n 
Saturday morning, I grab the 
Westchester papers. 
The headline reads, 
“Westchester D.A. busts multi-million dollar gambling ring. Suspect driving convicted cop 
killer’s car.” 
“F***ing lovely, Jesus Christ, 
multi-million-dollar-gambling 
ring, cop killer. Where do they get this shit?” 
Dominick’s buddy from the 
neighborhood went with him. The buddy borrowed his uncle’s car. 
Because this is a Bronx Italian 
ghetto, percentages are high that somebody’s relative is doing a “bit.”
It turns out Dom’s buddy’s un-
cle is doing a stretch for the worst crime of all — killing a cop. 
Complicating the disaster is 
the political ambitions of the Westchester D.A. She wants to be 
a Senator. 
If the press makes this look 
like she just captured the Loch 
Ness Monster...  
Saturday night and Sunday 
during the day, I’m working a 24-hour shift at the firehouse. 
I’m screwed. I can’t sleep, can’t eat, and 
can’t keep my mind on the job. 
I’m alone in the cellar’s weight 
room, pumping iron while turn-ing it over in my mind. 
Will Dom stand up?  Can I get that much money by 
Monday morning?  
Do I go to the jail to bail him 
out? 
Do I send someone else?  Many issues, no answers.I wish Blinky was back.
n n n
Sunday morning at the fire-
house, I’m ready to go downstairs 
to write the dayshift roll call. 
As I put on my uniform shirt, 
I hear the short blast of a police 
siren. 
The cops pull up outside quar -
ters. 
Jesus Christ, they’re coming 
for me at work. 
My heart sinks to my knees. A hard knot forms in the pit of my stomach. In my mind, a week passes. 
A voice generates loudly over 
the firehouse squawk box, “Lieu-tenant O’Connor, please report to the house watch booth.” 
I’m dead.
Downstairs, two uniformed 
cops look all business as they 
await my pale-faced, knee-knock-ing presence.  
One is about 25 years older 
than the other. As I approach them, I almost extend my two wrists to make it easier for them to apply the handcuffs. 
I think about leading with, “I 
know why you’re here.” 
But just before I confess, the 
older one barks, “You Lieutenant O’Connor?” 
Sullen, I bow my head, a nod 
accompanies my weak whisper, “Yeah.” 
He extends his hand.
“I’m Sergeant Molloy from the 
precinct around the corner. 
"Can you bring your fire truck 
by some time this morning and 
hang a new American flag on our 
flagpole? Last time we replaced 
it, you guys used your tower lad-der bucket.”  
My knees collapse as I reach 
for his extended palm. Not to shake hands, but to grab it for support to prevent me from col-lapsing at his feet. 
“You OK, Lieutenant? 
"You don’t look so good.”
