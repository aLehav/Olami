Mashli Fleurestil recognizes the 
diversity of UF’s Student Body, but 
as one black student out of 50,000, she feels that minorities are under-represented.
So Fleurestil, 19, picked up a 
marker and scribbled her sugges-tion on Swamp Party’s white post-er board outside the Reitz Union: “More minority parties.”
“I think everyone deserves the 
opportunities to be known, and that’s what UF is about,” the biology sophomore said.
As the only major registered po-
litical party, members of the Swamp Party set up posters on Turlington Plaza and at the Reitz on Monday to collect ideas from passing students 
for its Fall 2014 campaign platform. 
The biannual “platform generation” will continue today. The other four registered parties did not choose to 
campaign.
A common topic was seen on 
all poster boards: more safety and 
lighting in lieu of recent assaults on campus. One student wrote, “Light-
ing, UF is too dark at night.”
The Swamp Party ﬁ  lled about six 
poster boards, front and back, with 
student suggestions.   
Swamp Party spokeswoman 
Katie Backstrand said the party’s platform will be released in the next few weeks. The Swamp Party is us-ing the hashtag #BetterUF to make 
changes that students want.
“We’ve gone more toward mak-ing UF better for students,” she said.  
Another dominant request was 
more food choices such as Five 
Guys, Taco Bell and Burger King.  
Nate Reiff, a 19-year-old UF ﬁ  -
nance sophomore, suggested a Zax-by’s be built on Fraternity Row.  
“You have to take a bus to get to 
the nearest restaurant,” he said.
Fall elections are Sept. 30 and 
Oct. 1. #BetterUF helps generate platforms for Fall SG elections

The UF College of Dentistry announced 
Dr. Isabel Garcia as its new dean Monday. 
Garcia will head the college in February 
and will be the seventh permanent dean of 
the college. 
“The college is recognized as a national 
leader, and so there’s the potential to build on a tremendous legacy,” Garcia said. 
Garcia has served as 
the deputy director of the National Institute of Den-tal and Craniofacial Re-search in Maryland since 
2007 and has worked 
with the institute since 
1995. She has helped oversee the institute’s 
$400 million budget and staff of more than 400 scientists and administrators. She said her experience in leading and managing a large, complex organization will make her a good ﬁ  t as dean of the college. 
“The main difference is that where I 
work now, we are focusing on the education UF College of Dentistry welcomes new dean

UF’s campus could become a bit bright-
er at night.  
In response to the recent assaults on 
campus, at least 10 athletic ﬁ  elds kept their 
lights at full capacity until 3 a.m over the 
weekend. 
“This was a cooperation between cam-
pus administration, University Athletic As-
sociation and Student Affairs sports recre-ational group,” said Donna Winchester, UF director of strategic communications.
Winchester said there has been mention 
of adding lights, but that could take time. The cost and the decision to continue light-
ing them was unknown.
“It’s not something that could happen in 
a day,” she said. 
As evening exams continue for the up-
coming weeks, students are being encour-
aged to walk in well-lit areas and take ad-vantage of Student Auxiliary Nighttime Patrol vans and the Walk Safe Student Es-cort Program.
Danielle Bernard, a 19-year-old UF so-
ciology sophomore, avoids speciﬁ  c dark areas on campus.
“I never walk there because I expect it to 
be dark,” she said.
Anderson Hall makes her uneasy be-
cause of the lack of lighting and people. She usually walks with a group near that area.
“Being aware of my surroundings is the 
best thing to do,” Bernard said. Fields stay

More than 700 UF undergraduate 
students applied to medical schools 
across the country last year, and with 
a new version of the Medical College 
Admission Test debuting this Spring, questions have been raised about which test version current undergrads should 
take.
The new MCAT will debut this April 
and includes additional test topics, a 
nearly doubled testing period and up-dated test questions in order to coordi-
nate with current college prerequisites 
and modern medicine.
For students applying to UF’s Col-
lege of Medicine, director of admis-
sions Leila Amiri said the school has no 
test preference because the current test is being eliminated altogether.
“We look more closely to what they 
do outside of their MCAT scores,” Amiri said. “We evaluate on the stu-dent’s overall application.”
Previously the three-hour-plus exam 
focused on biology, general chemistry, organic chemistry and physics. Now 
students are also expected to know bio-
chemistry, psychology and sociology for the six-hour-plus exam.
“The science that underlies the 
medicine as well as the way medicine 
is practiced in this country has changed 
dramatically in the last 20-plus years,” said Owen Farcy, Kaplan test-prep di-rector.
The new types of questions and test-
taking skills will focus on research, ex-perimental design, graphical analysis and data interpretation, and Farcy said it will require “a lot more stamina and 
focus for students who are taking it.”
“Really what we recommend is that 
the student takes the version of the test 
that they think they will be the most 
comfortable with and the best prepared 
for,” Farcy said.
Amiri said UF will not change its 
prerequisites to supplement the new subject material because the current 
liberal-arts requirements cover those 
areas already.
Jake Rubin, a 21-year-old UF micro-
biology senior, took the original MCAT 
in May.
“I think it will be beneﬁ  cial to add 
those subjects,” Rubin said. “Especially 
biochem because it laid the foundation for the upper level classes I’m taking 
now.”
The ﬁ  nal version of the old exam 
will be administered in January.Changes to the MCAT make

UF microbiology seniorand training of researchers,” Garcia said, 
“and one of the college’s missions is the development and training of future oral health providers.”
Garcia was selected out of more than 
50 applicants after a nationwide search by UF. The search began in December 
after the previous dean, Dr. Teresa A. 
Dolan, stepped down in the Spring of 2013.
Dr. Robert Burne, who was on the 
search committee, said Garcia was rec-ommended from a highly competitive list of national and international appli-cants. 
“She’s an exceptional individual,” 
Burne said, “and she’s trained as a den-tist, so she has a very good understand-ing of what it means to be a dentist.” 
Burne, the chair of the UF depart-
ment of oral biology and associate dean for research, said the committee had to reopen the search in March after it chose four out of about 40 applicants, none of whom were selected. 
Garcia was then selected to head the 
college by UF Health President David Guzick. 
Garcia, a graduate from Virginia 
Commonwealth University and Univer-sity of Michigan,  has received awards in-cluding the National Institutes of Health Director’s Award for Mentoring and the U.S. Public Health Service Jack D. Rob-
ertson Award for outstanding long-term 
dedication and service to improve the nation’s oral health. 
“The college and university as a 
whole is known to be highly collabora-tive and so there are lots of partnerships existing across the colleges, centers and institutes,” Garcia said, “and obviously I’m interested in these opportunities and 
how I can help to expand them.”4, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 16, 2014

David Lee knows Florida’s springs.
The 22-year-old UF environmental engi-
neering senior has led a handful of Travel and Recreation Program journeys through the state’s waterways since January of last 
year.
So when the state legislature announced 
a $69 million surge in springs funding, Lee 
was pleased.
“It’s an awesome thing to see conserva-
tion happening around Florida,” he said. “It allows us to continue to do what we love and take people out and teach them about the environment.”
The Joint Legislative Budget Commis-
sion approved the multimillion-dollar con-servation plan proposed by the Florida De-
partment of Environmental Protection on 
Wednesday.
Approval of the funding increase green-
lights the department’s 27-project plan to rejuvenate the springs, bringing the total amount of springs-conservation invest-
ments to more than $100 million in the past 
two years.
Projects scheduled in the springs restora-
tion plan include assessing water quality in individual spring systems and fixing low-
flowing rivers.
Mark Wray owns eight Florida springs 
in the Santa Fe River System, including Gin-
nie and Blue springs. Wray said evaluating water quality is the state’s biggest issue.
“What’s truly hurting the springs is agri-
culture, bar none,” Wray said. “That’s what we have to get a handle on. Nitrates and pesticides are having a huge impact.”
The Santa Fe River System, which in-
cludes 81 private and state-owned springs around northeast Florida, currently holds 
an Outstanding Florida Water designation 
from the DEP.
According to the department’s website, 
this designation is intended to protect the naturally exceptional quality of the water by prohibiting direct and indirect discharges that could lower the water’s quality.
“The state knows what the issues are; 
they just need to start fixing them,” Wray 
said. “Hopefully this money will help.”State approves $69 million for spring restoration projectsCRIME

A Gainesville man was arrested for loitering and 
prowling after officers observed suspicious behavior at 
about 2 a.m. Monday.
Gainesville Police Officer Rob Narayan observed Wil-
lie Strawder, 28, standing between parked cars in a dimly 
lit residential parking lot, according to a report. Strawder 
noticed Officer Narayan’s patrol car and began to walk 
away quickly before he was stopped in a Subway parking 
lot at 1000 W. University Ave.
GPD spokesman Ben Tobias said Strawder admitted 
he did not live in the area and did not own any of the vehicles he was near. Strawder failed to provide reason for being in the area.
Without Officer Narayan even asking him, Strawder 
denied looking into the car windows and said he was looking for a place to sleep.
After being read his rights, Strawder told GPD officers 
he was looking for a Dumpster, even though the parking lot only contained parked cars, according to a report.
Strawder’s bail is set at $2,000.

A Gainesville man was arrested for grand theft of a 
motor vehicle early Sunday after he failed to return a rental car.
Enterprise reported the vehicle stolen Saturday after 
Kenari Myles Gardner, 21, did not return it on the date listed on the contract.
When first approached by GPD, Gardner said the ve-
hicle belonged to a friend of his named “Bash” and said he could retrieve “Bash” from inside of a club with law enforcement’s permission.
He then told officers that he “ain’t even gonna lie” and 
that the vehicle in fact belongs to Enterprise.
Gardner was then handcuffed and transported to Ala-
chua County Jail. His bail is set at $10,000.            

he was fighting off two men in front of his home when one man hit him over the head with a chrome-plated re-volver.
The victim said the men kept saying, “You know what’s 
up,” throughout the fight.
He told police he broke free and ran toward a neigh-
bor’s home. The two men – Devon Mackey and Malcom Towns – fled in their vehicle.
Shortly after the incident, the Alachua County Sheriff’s 
Office Patrol Division located the two men on Southeast Hawthorne Road.
Mackey was arrested for aggravated battery with a 
deadly weapon. Towns was arrested for possession of 
ammunition by a convicted felon after officers said he was

� FOUR DOCTORS HAVE DIED SO FAR. 
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
FREETOWN, Sierra Leone — Sierra Leone 
accused the World Health Organization on 
Monday of being “sluggish” in facilitating an evacuation of a doctor who died from Ebola before she could be sent out of the country for 
medical care.
Dr. Olivet Buck died Saturday, hours after 
the U.N. health agency said it could not help 
evacuate her to Germany.
Buck is the fourth Sierra Leonean doctor to 
die in an outbreak that has also touched Guin-ea, Liberia, Nigeria and Senegal. The West Af-rican outbreak has been blamed for more than 2,400 deaths, and experts say it is out of control. 
The U.S. has called an emergency meeting of 
the U.N. Security Council for this week to dis-cuss the crisis.
At a heated news conference Monday, a Sierra Leonean government official read a statement saying Buck is the second doctor from that country to die because negotiations on evacuation dragged on. Dr. Sheik Humarr 
Khan, the country’s top Ebola expert, was be-
ing considered for evacuation when he died of the disease in July.
“In both the cases of late Dr. Khan and Dr. 
Buck, we have observed a sluggish willingness by WHO in facilitating medical evacuation of Sierra Leonean Ebola-infected doctors for ad-vance treatment abroad,” said a statement from a presidential communications task force read out by Deputy Minister for Political and Public 
Affairs Karamoh Kabba.
He said the two doctors died while their 
fates “hung in negotiations.”
But WHO responded Monday that it can 
only evacuate its own staff, and that given the 
number of health workers becoming infected, the solution is not to evacuate them all anyway. Some 300 health care workers have been infect-
ed so far, about half of whom have died.Sierra Leone: WHO too slow 
to help doctors with Ebola“It’s an awesome thing to see 
conservation happening around 
Florida.”

General admission tickets for the 
remaining home games are now on 
sale with new prices. 
General admission tickets prior 
to this season were set at $50 per game. This year, the UAA is using a new method to determine game prices.
Dan Apple, assistant communi-
cations director for the UAA, said the new prices will help meet the supply and demand for more high 
profile games.
Tickets for the University of South Carolina and Louisiana State 
University games will be set at $85.
The homecoming game against 
Missouri will be priced at $50, and 
the last home game of the season 
against Eastern Kentucky will cost $25.
Valery Young, a 20-year-old UF 
recreation and event management junior, said the change will draw more people to the games. 
“If it were my parents, they 
would be more likely to show up,” 
she said. “They will definitely sell 
more tickets.” 
At the game this Saturday against 
Kentucky, 88,000 of the about 90,000 seats were filled in the Swamp.
“Based on the current pace and 
sale of tickets, it is anticipated we will sell out for several of the re-maining home games,” Apple said.
Tickets for the remaining games 
will be sold on a first-come, first-served basis.Home football tickets

GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip — After 
a ruinous war, Gaza is rushing back 
to a veneer of normalcy at astonish-ing speed. Street cafes and beaches are packed with people until late at 
night. Families crowd the few pub-
lic parks. Wedding halls are booked solid.
Gazans who endured 50 days of 
devastating Israeli bombardment are now eager to enjoy some life. Far from a celebration, however, Gazans themselves acknowledge the revelry is only to thinly mask trauma and 
widespread despair.
Many complain that none of the 
gains they hoped for from the war 
have been realized. 
“We go out just to steal a mo-
ment of joy,” said 33-year-old bank employee Rami Ali, sitting with friends at a seaside cafe. “We don’t 
know what will happen tomorrow; 
we might have another war.” 
The burst of liveliness is startling. 
Cafes on the streets or on Gaza’s Mediterranean beaches are main venues for nightlife because under Hamas, there are no cinemas or the-aters.
In the three weeks since fight-
ing ended, coffeehouses have been thronged with men, women and families. Commercial streets are choked with shoppers.
The Hamas government appears 
to have been caught off guard. Last week, authorities banned street par-ties, saying they were acting out of respect for the families of the dead. That put an end to bachelor celebra-
tions traditionally held in the streets 
ahead of weddings — but not other forms of nightlife.
The war was the longest and deadliest of three Hamas-Israel wars in less than six years. More than 2,000 
Palestinians, including 500 children, 
were killed, 11,000 wounded and close to 100,000 made homeless out of a population of 1.8 million.
Entire blocks were flattened. 
Some 50 families were wiped out, with at least 300 women killed, and up to 1,500 children were orphaned, according to Mona al-Shawa of 
the Palestinian Center for Human 
Rights.
“We are a people with an excep-
tional ability to endure, but the most painful thing is the feeling that you are living in an oppressive world and no one is taking your side,” al-Shawa said. “What defines being a Gazan is the feeling of oppression.”
Seventy-two people were killed 
on the Israeli side, including six ci-vilians, in a war that erupted on July 8 when Israel launched a mas-sive aerial bombardment of Gaza in response to heavy rocket fire by Hamas and other Gaza militants.
Even amid the rush for enjoy-
ment, Gazans grimly note that none 
of Hamas’ stated objectives — lifting 
the blockade and allowing the open-ing of an airport and a seaport — was achieved.
The only positive outcome was 
that Israel extended the limit for fishermen to operate off Gaza’s shores from three to six miles, bring-ing greater hauls of seafood in the 
markets.
Mahmoud Daher, director of the 
U.N. World Health Organization’s 
office in Gaza, said he has seen a rise in domestic violence, which he attri-butes to the sense of frustration.
“There may not be a single Pales-
tinian in Gaza who thinks the future will be brighter,” he said.Gazans rush to enjoy 
life after ruinous war“If it were my parents,

� ONE PUPPY, ONE RABBIT, AND 22 
GOATS HAVE DIED SINCE 2011.
CHABELI HERRERA
Alligator Staff Writer cherrera@alligator.org
Twenty-two goats, one rabbit and one puppy 
have died as a result of negligent care on behalf of 
UF, according to a complaint issued Monday by an-imal rights group Stop Animal Exploitation NOW. 
In two complaints issued to the U.S. Department 
of Agriculture since August, Stop Animal Exploi-tation NOW details several incidents beginning in 2011 that violated the Animal Welfare Act.
“We believe the public has a right to know what 
goes on in those laboratories,” said executive direc-tor Michael Budkie. 
The first report, filed by UF in January 2012, in-
volves the death of 22 goats due to severe anemia.In the 2011 incident, staff and graduate students per-
forming studies on the goats failed to treat or eutha-
nize them after the study was completed. 
As a result, three died spontaneously and 19 
were subsequently euthanized. 
In another report, filed by the university in Oc-
tober 2012, a New Zealand white rabbit was found dead hanging out of its cage door after it wedged it-self between the bars due to fear from a fire alarm. 
In the most recent complaint, Stop Animal Ex-
ploitation NOW cites a May 2013 UF report docu-menting a veterinary technician who neglected to 
administer appropriate treatment to a dog diag-
nosed with glaucoma. 
Although the UF-prescribed treatment was in-
tended to be daily, the veterinary technician failed to deliver it as instructed. 
The technician was suspended and resigned be-
fore the completion of the investigation.
The Stop Animal Exploitation NOW complaint 
further details a May 2012 USDA inspection, which found that a beagle puppy was not fed properly and was then euthanized due to severe weight loss. 
UF reported the incidents to the National Insti-
tute of Health, however, Budkie said the institute doesn’t have the power to fine UF for deaths. 
Stop Animal Exploitation NOW hopes the 
USDA will take action against UF and fine the uni-
versity $10,000 per infraction. 
“What we are seeing here is a long-term pattern 
of failure to follow what are really very basic federal 
regulations,” Budkie said. 
“Why should we believe that they are capable of 
doing science? What does that say about how ev-erything else is being done?” he added.
UF has been under fire before. In a 2013 com-
plaint issued by animal rights group Eleventh Hour 
for Animals, a macaque monkey wasn’t treated for 
a broken hip and was then euthanized in 2010. 
“There’s a great deal of carelessness,” said Elev-
enth Hour for Animals founder Camille Marino.
She said she is glad these infractions are coming 
to light but suspects worse issues are at play. 
“I am so unconcerned about these minor welfare 
violations because it gives people the impression that the other 99 percent of what they are doing is 
humane,” Marino said. 
He continued, “Nothing could be further from 
the truth. The experiments that they are doing with-
in the guidelines of the law are far more heinous and disturbing than any of these violations.” 
UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes wrote in an email 
that the university “took appropriate measures to prevent reocurrences, which may have included additional training, updating protocols and disci-plining employees or students.”
UF’s animal care and use program has been ac-
credited since 1966, and “UF veterinarians oversee animal care and strive to always provide a healthy, safe environment for the animals,” according to the statement. 
Still, Budkie, who has filed several successful 
complaints in the last year, said he wants to see the negligence pattern come to an end.  
“This facility should face serious consequences 
for the deaths of these animals,” he said in a press release.  “It’s clear that the UF officials who are re-sponsible for supervising animal experiments are not doing their jobs.”UF under scrutiny for alleged un-
ethical animal treatment since ‘11Reader response

Scott’s policy on 
transportation rife 
with hypocrisy
If there’s one thing Gov. Rick Scott claims to stand for, it’s low-
ering taxes.
In May 2013, Scott boasted about having cut taxes in Flor-
ida “24 times.” By May of this year, the number of tax cuts has reached 40, according to tweets sent out by Scott’s campaign.
Leaving aside the dubious accuracy of these claims, which 
Politico and other fact-checking organizations have explored extensively, it’s clear that Scott wants to portray himself as a ﬁ  s-cally responsible, anti-tax conservative.
Those who believe Scott show a desire to improve the ﬁ  nanc-
es of ordinary Floridians might be surprised to hear about his new plans to install toll lanes on Florida’s major highways.
Scott is undertaking this massive infrastructure project, which 
the Tampa Bay Times says could be the largest in Florida history, 
without any approval from the legislature or from voters.
Unsurprisingly, one of the motivations behind the creation of 
these toll lanes is the corrupt ‘crony capitalism’ that has become 
a hallmark of Scott’s administration.
A report from the Florida Center for Investigative Reporting 
found that the projects were inspired by studies from the Reason Foundation, a libertarian think tank that has received funding from major toll-lane developers. These developers stand to earn millions of dollars — if not more — from the toll lanes. 
The Times also reported that Florida Department of Trans-
portation Secretary Ananth Prasad is a former employee of one of these major developers. During his time as head of the DOT, Prasad has approved billions of dollars in toll-lane projects, in-cluding funds that have gone directly to his former employer.
Supporters of the new toll lanes argue that they will make 
travel more efﬁ  cient for Floridians. However, it seems unlikely that efﬁ  cient transit is Scott’s priority, given his recent history with similar infrastructure projects.
In 2011, Scott declined to accept federal funding for high-
speed rail projects and argued that the initiative “would be far too costly to taxpayers.” Scott made these claims despite wide-spread agreement that high-speed rail would have boosted the economy and made faster and more convenient transportation.
Scott did eventually provide tepid support for high-speed rail 
projects, but only after ensuring that Florida East Coast Indus-tries, a private company with connections to Scott’s former chief of staff, Adam Hollingsworth, would be constructing them.
The high-speed rail project, All Aboard Florida, has subse-
quently applied for a federal loan of $1.5 billion, so Scott’s claims about the unmatched superiority of private enterprise and the free market ring pathetically hollow. 
This controversy is just the latest conﬁ  rmation of what all 
Floridians should already know: Scott is interested in serving corporations and the wealthy, not Florida voters.
The costs and beneﬁ  ts of particular government initiatives to 
Florida taxpayers are irrelevant to Scott, so long as his corporate 
allies and campaign donors reap the ultimate reward. Florida 
undoubtedly deserves better.

Sarkara Sweets cupcakes? Today’s question: Do you think UF should be sued for 
the lab animal deaths?Talking about mental illness is a must
When legendary actor and comedian Robin Williams 
died about a month ago, hearts broke around the world. Social media erupted with grief-stricken 
statuses and tweets mourning the loss of such a beloved and talented person, someone whom many of us remember 
from some of our favorite childhood movies like “Hook” 
and “Aladdin.”
Most of us expressed shock and dismay that someone 
with so much externally expressed energy and passion was suffering so much on the inside.
While Williams’ death was a tragedy for all who knew 
and loved him, it also served as an important reminder about the devastating effects of untreated mental illness. Amid the pain and anguish, Robin Williams’ suicide shed light on this 
issue, which is so important yet often ignored.
The connection between Williams’ death and his battle 
with severe depression dominated the headlines for weeks. 
People all across the country felt empowered to share their own experiences with depression, bipolar disorder and other mental health conditions. Suddenly, everyone upset about his death became instant advocates for mental health, criti-cizing the stigmatization of mental illness and demanding a more comprehensive mental-health care system.
Finally, a national conversation about mental illness be-
gan, a conversation that was well overdue.
But when the media frenzy around Robin Williams’ 
death calmed down, so did the impassioned pleas for men-tal-health awareness. Once the issue was no longer trending on Facebook or Twitter, no one wanted to discuss it, and the conversation was over nearly as quickly as it had started.
We cannot allow the issue of mental illness to continually 
be ignored. According to the National Alliance on Mental 
Illness, about 13.6 million Americans are living with serious 
mental illnesses, including depression or bipolar disorder.
Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the U.S., and 
more than 90 percent of people who die by suicide had one or more mental illnesses. These are frightening statistics.
Mental illness does not discriminate. It can affect anyone 
at any time, and the results can be shattering.
The alarming facts about mental illness prove that we owe it to ourselves, our friends, our families and our communities to make mental health a priority. Right now, it clearly isn’t.
Access to mental-health care is 
extremely limited and costly. Ac-cording to the Washington Post, it’s more difﬁ  cult to get access to a mental-health professional than any other type of doctor. Even when services are available, many insurance companies do not con-
sider mental illness to be a primary health concern. 
Even more troubling is that in times of economic decline, 
funds for mental-health care are cut signiﬁ  cantly. During the recession, states dropped a combined $1.8 billion from their mental-health care budgets. The cuts in Florida have been particularly drastic, now ranking a pathetic 49th in mental-health care funding nationally.
Under these circumstances, it’s hardly surprising that 
many people with a mental illness decide not to seek treat-ment. The effort of ﬁ  nding mental-health services combined with the overwhelming cost is enough to discourage most 
people from pursuing medical care, even if they are experi-
encing tremendous pain and suffering.
We cannot wait for the death of another beloved public 
ﬁ  gure to inspire us to take action.
To help combat the sad reality of our country’s inadequate 
mental-health care system, it’s up to all of us to express our support and offer encouragement to those who are dealing with mental illness. We must not allow anyone to try to face that battle alone and suffer in silence, something that hap-
pens all too often in America today.
We must continue to share our personal experiences with 
mental illness and also offer to listen to the stories of others. 
If we truly want to make a difference and shape the future for the better, we have to keep talking. The conversation about mental health must continue.

#BetterUF platform generation ends 
today
Dear UF students,
This campaign season, Swamp Party is 
driving platform generation in a more all-encompassing, student-focused direction. Yesterday, Swamp Party candidates were on 
Turlington Plaza and in the Reitz Union area 
with white boards, markers and a new twist: #BetterUF. Students had the opportunity to fill in what they would like to see Student Gov-ernment change on the UF campus. The first day of this new approach was very successful. 
We encourage students to stop by Turlington 
Plaza and the Reitz today from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. for the last opportunity to write about how they would like to #BetterUF.
For example, a student might write: “I want to see increased nighttime safety in order to #BetterUF.” SG has responded to this issue by bringing the new transportation system Uber to campus in order to ensure students have a 
safe and reliable way of getting home. 
#BetterUF will allow the Swamp Party to 
reach out to every student demographic and 
see what he or she wants us to do.
Students are also encouraged to tweet @UFSwamp and share their ideas for the Swamp Party if they are unable to stop by one of our stations. 
We would love to see as many students 
out there with ideas — no matter how big or small.
Go Gators!

Letters to the Editor
Recently, Nickelodeon’s hit chil-
dren’s show, “Dora the Explorer,” had a major makeover.
Dora, the show’s protagonist, was previ-
ously a vaguely androgynous 5- or 6-year-
old child who regaled America’s toddlers with basic Spanish-language lessons and a couple of cute catchphrases — most fa-mously “Swiper, no swiping!” Her new look has transformed her into a preteen, complete with all the accessories and mannerisms a girl is supposed to take on when she enters 
puberty.
Dora’s new persona includes makeup, a 
traditionally feminine outfit with frills and 
a troop of fun new girlfriends to take on the city together. The show even has new pre-teen boy characters to play potential crushes and a massive line of “Dora and Friends: Into the City!” products to rake in cash for the cre-ators.
What was once an educational, whole-
some children’s program has become “Sex and the City” marketed to a preteen audi-ence.
In some ways, the changes make sense. 
Dora has been on the air since 2000. She’s growing up, right? It’s time for a makeover.
It’s no surprise the show’s designers 
turned Dora into a character who typifies the gender roles and heteronormativity that characterize American culture. Most other current children’s TV shows are also drip-
ping with sexism and fail to include diverse 
aspects of gender and sexuality.
So why the fuss about Dora?The answer is complicated. When I heard 
about the Dora makeover, I was saddened. It wasn’t because of the loss of the old Dora — the peak popularity of “Dora the Explorer”  missed my generation by a few years — but because Dora getting older required a com-
plete, socially acceptable makeover.
American media and social norms put a 
lot of pressure on girls to conform to the ideal 
female stereotypes they have created.  There are expectations for a female’s body, her ca-reer path and which milestones she should reach at certain points in her life.When we enter 
college, we face pressure to con-form to what the media wants us to 
become in our later years.
Our society’s cultural norms say ev-
ery woman should be a young, powerful 20-something who has her future planned out and goes out with her girlfriends every weekend.
Society tells us females must adapt to the 
norm if we expect to be acknowledged and have our voices heard. We have to say the 
right things, act the right way and even eat 
the right foods.
The change isn’t all bad. College is the 
perfect time for young adults to discover themselves and, sometimes, to become something new.
Despite the transitory nature of the teen-
age and college experiences, I’m upset with the media and the pressure of society hav-
ing so much influence over young women. 
We are sometimes forced into roles that we haven’t chosen — roles with which we are uncomfortable. We may regret who we be-come out of a feeling that we need to fit in and obey the rules.
The media is a powerful and valuable 
tool, but the pressure it puts on women to adapt to a lofty ideal often results in discon-
tent and a loss of self-confidence for count-
less American females.
The media’s influence is so great that 
even 10-year-old girls watching “Dora and Friends: Into the City!” may feel pressure to start remaking themselves into the perfect preteen in order to be noticed. 
With that kind of power, what impact 
might the media have on a generation of 
young college-aged women trying to shape 
their own adult lives?  
To what ideal will American women seek 
to conform: the one the media has created for us or our own?

Imagine you are a citi-
zen of one of the African countries where the Eb-
ola virus has spread so far: Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Si-
erra Leone. 
You have a friend who is at home 
exhausted with a fever. She has lost her 
appetite due to abdominal pain and she 
complains of headaches and diarrhea.
You see the signs. You’ve already lost 
a brother and a father.
The medics in bodysuits say they are 
going to help those who feel sick. You saw 
the care in their eyes, so you let your fam-ily walk into the white tents of death.
You will not let your friend be abduct-
ed by the aliens. You hide her when they come around.
Only a few of their captives come out 
of the tents alive, and those who don’t can’t even see their family one last time because they might become — what was that word? Oh — infected.
You didn’t get to say goodbye to your 
brother, and your dad said the aliens are just trying to help. Now he’s gone, too, and you aren’t sure what to believe.
You wouldn’t ever think of sending 
your friend.
President Barack Obama said a “na-
tional security priority” is now placed on the Ebola epidemic in an interview broadcast Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” 
There will be troops sent overseas to 
set up isolation units and to provide se-curity for public health workers.
Now these Africans will not only be 
scared to death of being abducted, but also of being shot while rebelling against the aliens stealing their loved ones.The U.S. is scared of the vi-
rus seeping into the States.
Africa is scared of the inter-
national aid.
First of all, the U.S. needs 
to pipe down. 
If the virus did enter the country, our 
medical infrastructure would quarantine the problem almost immediately. 
This outbreak is not a threat to the 
U.S., and it is despicable to me how much attention we give to it.
It is a threat to our fellow humans, not 
to our own safety. It’s so unlikely to be-
come as much of a problem in America as 
it is in Africa it’s almost a nonissue.
And in Africa, the people need to be-
lieve we are on the same side, working toward the same goal. 
Along with making the African fear 
of treatment worse, scientists and med-ics should not have to be protected by the U.S. armed services while doing their 
job.
There is no approved cure for Ebola 
other than treating the symptoms as they 
appear. 
The cases that have increased chances 
of survival are those where the disease is identified early. 
Predictably, the mortality rate in this 
2014 outbreak in Africa is worse because 
of the fear of treatment.
In order to combat this, understand-
ing needs to be reached among all of us.
It’s an awareness of what’s going on. 
It’s an honest humanitarian outreach 
from the U.S. and an acceptance of help from the Africans.

By now you’ve seen it.

scious body from the elevator.
In the eyes of the NFL and Com-
missioner Roger Goodell, that series of images was worthy of a two-game ban, upgraded to an indefinite sus-pension only after the video footage created public outcry.
University of California, Los 
Angeles coach Jim Mora saw it as a chance to teach his players.
“I talk to the team about just 
about every social issue that comes across the wire,” Mora said Thurs-day after practice. “There’s great learning opportunities there. And if we can find an opportunity to teach our guys the right way to do some-thing, then we do that.”
Mora’s approach is the right 
way to handle such situations, but it doesn’t seem like a common one among his colleagues in the NFL. 
Too often in sports, the emphasis is 
placed on winning, with everything else pushed aside. Off-field issues and arrests often result in the puni-tive equivalent of a time-out in the corner as long as players keep per-forming on the field.
Take the San Francisco 49ers, 
where Mora served on the coaching 
staff from 1997 to 2003. Defensive 
tackle Ray McDonald was arrested Aug. 30 on suspicion of felony do-mestic violence. His punishment from the 49ers? A start in the first game of the season.
Jed York, the 49ers’ CEO, said he will give McDonald his due process before doling out a team punishment, which makes sense. It upholds the “innocent until proven guilty” mantra. And technically, a 
team can’t suspend a player if he 
hasn’t been proven guilty, though it can still bench or release him. But that sends the wrong message.
It gives off the idea that the 49ers 
and the NFL community care more about the three tackles McDonald gave the 49ers in their first game than the fact that he was arrested 
for allegedly assaulting his fiancee.
That’s not the message Mora wants. He made that clear last season.When offensive tackle Torian 
White was arrested on suspicion of sexual assault last November, Mora immediately suspended him from the team. There was no waiting for 
due process. Even though White 
was never convicted, he was dis-missed from the team.
Mora isn’t alone in the college 
world in taking swift punitive ac-tion. UCLA’s Week 3 opponent, University of Texas, has been mired in its fair share of off-field issues this offseason as new coach Charlie 
Strong has been demanding higher 
standards from his players.
After Texas wide receivers Ken-
dall Sanders and Montrel Meander were arrested and charged with felony sexual assault, Strong im-mediately suspended them and dis-missed them from the program.
Sanders played a key role for 
Texas last year and figured to be an important member of the offense again this season. Strong, who dis-
missed five players this offseason 
from the team and suspended three indefinitely, has taken a stand that the men he coaches need to be just as good off the field as they are on.
Athletes need to be held to higher 
standards, the same standards that all other “common” people are held to. The quality of the player comes 
second to the quality of the person.
College coaches are starting to 
figure it out. Now it’s time for the 
pros to get on their level.

Attorney General Pam Bondi announced 
Friday she will be ﬁ  ling appeals in several 
same-sex marriage cases across the state. 
Bondi will act as a defendant in four cas-
es overturning the state’s ban on same-sex marriage. 
Bondi, who has not intervened in previ-
ous rulings, decided to intervene now “to promote an orderly and consistent reso-
lution of pending challenges to the voter-
approved constitutional provision on mar-riage,” according to a statement. 
She asked judges across the state to stop 
ruling in same-sex marriage cases until the U.S. Supreme Court makes a decision on the constitutionality of the ban.
Director of UF LGBT affairs, LB Han-nahs, doesn’t expect Bondi’s involvement 
to change the day-to-day lives of the LGBT 
community, but hopes it will continue to raise awareness on the issue, especially with the upcoming gubernatorial race in 
November. 
“It kicks up support 
for the issue and makes it 
something that people are paying attention to,” Han-
nahs, 30, said. “I think 
it’s just a waiting game now.”
Terry Fleming, co-pres-
ident of the Pride Com-
munity Center of North Central Florida, said Bondi’s involvement only delays the inevitable. 
“It certainly looks like the ultimate result 
of these cases will be that same-sex couples will be allowed to marry in Florida,” he 
said. “But if she wasn’t appealing the cases, 
same-sex couples would be marrying today and we wouldn’t have to wait for the Su-preme Court to decide.”
Fleming, who is a veteran, said the de-
lay is also an issue for couples like him and his husband, who were married in another state and now can’t access their marriage rights and can’t transfer Fleming’s veteran 
beneﬁ  ts to his spouse in Florida because of 
the ban. 
“There are some same-sex couples 
whose legal decision-making is contingent 
on Florida providing full rights to LGBT 
couples,” he said. “There are couples that cannot wait based on the circumstances of their lives.”
“Justice delayed is justice denied,” he 
said.Bondi announces plans to appeal same-sex marriage cases

Miss America’s cup
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
The new Miss America says 
there are more important things 
for people to worry about than her little red cup.
That was the message Mon-
day from Kira Kazantsev, of New York, as some social me-dia users panned her use of a plastic cup during the talent portion of Sunday night's pag-eant ﬁ  nale in Atlantic City.
Kazantsev told The Asso-
ciated Press she realizes ev-erything she does now will be 
scrutinized and commented 
on. But she says she performed Pharrell Williams' "Happy" while tapping a cup on the ﬂ  oor because that's what she wanted to do, regardless of what any-one else might think.
"There are so many more 
important issues in this world 
that people should be worried 
about than my plastic cup," she said Monday morning after taking the traditional dip in the Atlantic City surf the morning after winning the crown. 
"I hope people understand 
that's just part of who I am, and I wanted to present myself that way I wanted to," she said.
Her pageant causes include 
eliminating sexual assaults in the military and preventing domestic violence. The Hofstra University graduate plans to attend law school with the $50,000 scholarship she won in the pageant.
Kazantsev said her talent 
portion was inspired by the 2012 movie "Pitch Perfect," in which Anna Kendrick's charac-ter auditions for an a cappella group by performing rhythmi-cally with a cup.
She said she is not particu-
larly concerned with the online 
reaction to her own perfor-
mance.
"It's unconventional; and 
sometimes people aren't as open to change as some would like," Kazantsev said.TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 16, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 9

WASHINGTON — A federal 
judge ruled Monday that a Florida 
woman can pursue her lawsuit al-leging the government invaded her privacy in the scandal over former 
CIA director David Petraeus.
U.S. District Judge Amy Berman 
Jackson said Jill Kelley of Tampa can 
move ahead with claims that the FBI and Defense Department violated her privacy when ofﬁ  cials leaked information about her to the news media.
In 2012, Kelley complained to the 
FBI when an unknown person, later identiﬁ  ed as Paula Broadwell, Petra-eus’ biographer and mistress, sent her harassing emails. Kelley’s name and some of the harassing emails were leaked to the news media amid the sensational disclosures about 
Petraeus, a former Army general.
The leaks also 
linked Marine Gen. John Allen, the commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, as 
being under investigation for alleg-edly inappropriate communications with Kelley.
According to court ﬁ  lings by Kel-
ley’s lawyers, the government false-ly told one news outlet the emails between Allen and Kelley were the equivalent of phone sex. The law-yers argued it was likely that Kel-ley’s treatment was motivated by sexual discrimination.
The Pentagon’s inspector general exonerated Allen, who subsequently retired.
On Monday, Jackson threw out 
more than a dozen allegations in 
the lawsuit ﬁ  led by Kelley and her 
husband, Scott, but allowed a single claim to move forward — a charge that the FBI and Defense Depart-ment violated the Privacy Act. The act is a post-Watergate law designed to protect people from unwarranted invasions of privacy by federal agen-cies that maintain sensitive informa-
tion about them.
In a statement, Kelley said she 
and her husband are pleased with 
the judge’s decision.
“We have asked our attorneys 
to move forward quickly with dis-covery, to uncover the relevant facts and motivations from all the govern-ment ofﬁ  cials involved,” she said.

said Monday they followed 
proper protocol when they 
demanded identiﬁ  cation from 
an actress and her boyfriend while investigating a 911 call alleging lewd conduct in a 
parked car.
Actress Daniele Watts, 
who appeared in “Django 
Unchained,” said she was unjustly handcuffed and de-
tained Thursday after refus-
ing to provide identiﬁ  cation and walking away from of-ﬁ  cers responding to a report 
of lewd conduct in a car along 
Ventura BoulevarD.
Watts said in an interview 
Monday that she and her boyfriend, Brian Lucas, were 
kissing in the car and fully 
clothed, with nothing im-proper going on.
She and Lucas wrote about 
the incident on Facebook and posted photos of a cry-ing Watts in handcuffs. Lucas said he suspects onlookers assumed Watts to be a prosti-tute and him a client because 
she is black and he is white.
Los Angeles police Lt. An-
drew Neiman said citizens 
are required to identify them-selves if requested to do so by 
an ofﬁ  cer who has reasonable 
suspicion to believe an offense may have been committed.In this case, he said, rea-
sonable suspicion was creat-ed by the 911 call, and Watts and Lucas ﬁ  t the description 
and location described by the 
caller.
Celebrity website TMZ 
posted audio of the exchange between Watts and police. 
Neiman and Bill McCoy, a 
spokesman for the couple, said the audio is authentic, though its origin is unknown.
On the recording, a po-
lice sergeant is heard telling Watts, “Somebody called, which gives me the right to be here, so it gives me the right 
to identify you by law.”
Neiman said it is unlikely 
that a recording of the 911 
call will be made public. The 
results of the LAPD’s inter-
nal investigation of the mat-ter, which could take several months, are also unlikely to be released, he said.
Watts said the ofﬁ  cer’s 
demeanor was an emotional trigger for her because of personal and historical expe-
riences of racial proﬁ  ling by 
police.
“I can understand how 
people would say that I’m be-ing a drama queen and that I created this situation for pub-licity,” she said. “To a certain degree, you can say they’re 
correct in that if I’m going to 
be in the public eye, I’m going to stand up for what I believe in, and I don’t believe I com-
mitted any crime where I de-
served to be in handcuffs.”Police: Protocol fol-
lowed in detention of ‘Django’ actress

Quarterback Jeff Driskel 
was not ready to play when he 
stepped onto the field for the first 
non-garbage time snap of his ca-
reer. 
He did not know how to pre-
pare and did not take it seriously 
that he was one injury away from 
being “the guy” at Florida. 
Then John Brantley went 
down shortly before halftime and Driskel took the reins on Oct. 1, 
2011, against Alabama whether 
he liked it or not. 
The opponent was no slouch 
— the colors here remain the 
same, different players donning 
the Crimson and White — with Driskel presumably a bit more prepared than he was last time. 
“They weren’t good,” Driskel 
said of his memories from that night. 
“Definitely underprepared. 
Didn’t know how to prepare at 
that time to play anybody, espe-
cially Alabama as good as they were. 
“Just going in not knowing 
what you’re doing is not a good situation. I’m not going to let that happen again. I’m going to do whatever I can this week to pre-
pare and be as ready as I can. I 
know that’s best for the football team. So, that’s what I’m going to 
do.”
Driskel said Monday that his lack of preparedness hurt him on both the mental and physical 
sides of the game. He made a mistake resulting 
in a bobbled snap, was rolled up on and injured. 
Now things are different for 
Driskel.
He is the man in charge of 
Florida’s new-look offense and he is ready to instruct his under-study on how to be ready at the drop of a hat.
“Going in as the starting quar-
terback, you know what you’ve got to prepare for, you know what you’re getting into,” Driskel 
said. 
“At that time, I didn’t know 
how close I was to playing. You 
don’t realize you’re one snap away from playing. That’s where 
I went wrong as a freshman. I’m 
going to let Treon (Harris) know, ‘I could go down any play. You might have to go in and play 
well, so be ready to do that.’”
The student meets the teacher 
yet again: Will Muschamp would 
not be where he is today if not for Alabama coach Nick Saban — he 
admitted as much Monday.

ban at both LSU and again with

In games four and five of its streak of six 
straight away games, the Gators took away 
a lot of positives from its West Coast week-end.
On Friday in Palo Alto, Calif., No. 6 
Florida (5-2) had the opportunity to face off against No. 4 Stanford (6-0-1). 
In a very evenly matched game played 
at a high level by both teams, Florida would eventually fall to Stanford on an overtime penalty kick.
Coach Becky Burleigh said despite the 
loss, she saw many positive things from 
her team that they can continue to build 
and improve upon.
“I think we took a lot from that experi-
ence,” Burleigh said. 
“The mood of the team after that match was very upbeat and that showed on Sun-day.”
And it certainly showed on Sunday.Florida flew into Albuquerque eager to 
avenge its loss two nights earlier. 
And it did so in dominant fashion.Florida beat New Mexico 4-0, equaling 
their highest goal output of the season. 
Sophomore Savannah Jordan scored 
twice on the day, putting her at five goals 
for the year — a team high. 
Junior Lauren Smith added her first goal 
of the season, and sophomore Brooke Sharp 
contributed with her second goal of the year as well as her second assist.New faces make impact for

It was nearly three decades ago when 
she embarked on her head-coaching ca-
reer, barely a year removed from play-ing college volleyball and with zero ex-perience as a coach.
Mary Wise 
is the first per-son to admit her initial unfa-
miliarity with the job that she was sud-denly at the helm of, even if she did not quite realize it more than 30 years ago.
“Have you ever been 21?” she said, 
laughing. “I didn’t even know what I 
didn’t know.”
But Wise knew volleyball, and that 
was all that mattered.
She was 22 when she coached her 
first collegiate match at Iowa State, one 
of two instances during her 33-year ca-reer that Wise said she would never for-get.
The other was Friday in Los Angeles when she reached win No. 800 of her ca-reer after sweeping Southern California.
“You know, I was asked if I remem-
bered the 700th or the 600th,” Wise said. “I remember number one, but I will defi-nitely remember 800.”
The Gator alumnae showed up in 
droves — either to watch their former coach make history or to reminisce on their own time with Florida. 
The reason did not matter. It only mattered to Wise that her for-
mer pupils were there, basking in the moment and sharing it with her, too.
“I think what really made it special 
was how many of our former players were in the stands at USC,” Wise said. “That group, they were a part of a whole lot of wins. So we really did get to share it.”
There were representatives present 
from each decade of Wise’s tenure at Florida – most notably Kelly Murphy, who is currently a U.S. National Team Wise reflects on 800 wins
See Soccer, page 14See volley, page 14UF Volleyball“The mood of the team after that 
match was very upbeat and that 
showed on Sunday.”
Becky Burleigh
UF coachmember, Kari Klinkenborg from the 
mid 2000’s era and even Kim Hale from 1991, during Wise’s ﬁ  rst year at UF.
Some former players could not 
be at USC with Wise, but they man-aged to communicate their well wishes in other ways.
“My phone blew up with text 
messages,” Wise said. “I still love 
staying in touch with those players. 
… We stay here and we win because of those talented players.”
Wise’s career achievements are 
astounding, and some of them jus-tiﬁ  ably groundbreaking.
She was the ﬁ  rst collegiate vol-
leyball coach to win 100 consecu-tive games and the ﬁ  rst female head coach to reach the NCAA National Championship. 
She was also the ﬁ  rst coach to 
win more than 90 percent of a pro-gram’s matches during the ﬁ  rst 16 seasons of a career, and did it all while reaching 500 wins faster than 
any Division I female coach.
Somehow, Wise’s career mile-
stone of 800 wins pales in compari-
son to her past accolades.
Did it ever cross her mind, back 
when she was a 22-year old head coach at Iowa State, that she would be where she is today?
“No. At the time did I even think I 
would be in coaching for this long?” Wise said, smiling. “I was making $13,000 thinking I was living the good life. I had just graduated from Purdue. But again, a different era. You’re not going to hire somebody with no experience (today).”
Now, Wise has more experience 
than she ever could have hoped for. Twelve Southeastern Confer-ence Coach of the Year awards, two National Coach of the Year awards, 
and nineteen SEC championships 
later, Wise remains one of the most highly regarded collegiate volley-
ball authorities in the nation.
After ﬁ  nally reaching win No. 
800 and year No. 23, how many more of each can Florida expect from its proliﬁ  c coach?
“I think you stay in places when 
there are no push factors,” Wise said. “And when you’re at Florida, there are no push factors.”
The Lobos had no answer 
for Florida’s high-powered 
offense.
In all, Florida played 21 
players in Sunday’s match. 
The roster is made up of 
25. 
Once again, the Gators’ 
depth played a huge role for them in a decisive victory.
“We used a lot of players 
in that match (against New 
Mexico),” Burleigh said. “It 
was great for some of the younger players to get some experience in a situation like 
that too, and to come away 
with a shutout and a 4-0 vic-tory on the road, it was just a good ending for the week-end.”
Florida also received con-
tributions on Sunday from a new but familiar face. 
Senior Karina Gutsche 
made her ﬁ  rst appearance for the Gators this year after suffering a sprained MCL in a preseason practice. 
She started every match 
at center defensive back in 2013 and will play a big role in strengthening an already talented Florida back line.
Redshirt sophomore Val-
erie Tysinger also played at goalkeeper in the second half of Florida’s victory over New 
Mexico, making her third ap-
pearance of the season be-hind starter Taylor Burke.
Tysinger had six saves in 
the win over the Lobos, and now has nine saves in just 90 minutes of action this season with no goals allowed. 
She and Burke together 
recorded the shutout on Sun-
day.
“I think Val has been re-
ally, really good in practice 
and really consistent,” Bur-
leigh said. 
“I think she has deserved 
that opportunity and con-
tinues to deserve more op-portunity, so we’re really 
fortunate to have a situation 
where both goalkeepers are very competent in what they do.”Karina Gutsche

While he will not run as part 
of Florida’s cross country team 
on Saturday, senior Mark Parrish 
looks to continue the success he 
saw at UF when he competes in-dependently at the 26th Mountain Dew Invitational in Gainesville.
Parrish, who exhausted his 
four years of cross country eligi-bility last year, will be noticeably absent for a deep Florida squad that aims to repeat on the years of 
success they’ve seen at their lone 
home meet of the season.
Coach Paul Spangler is just 
happy to see Parrish back out 
there, even if it is not with his 
men’s team — a team that has claimed the team title nine times out of the last 10 years at the Mountain Dew Invitational.
“With the collegiate system, 
you can race unattached,” Span-gler said. 
“And a lot of athletes will do 
that, even if they’re redshirting or if they’re post-collegiate, which is why Mark can compete.”
Parrish has only improved as 
his career progressed. 
He broke the school’s 8k re-
cord at the Wisconsin adidas In-vitational, stopping the clock at 
23:34, one second faster than the 
mark set by Jeremy Criscione in 2008. He broke his personal best 
10k at the 2013 NCAA South Re-gion Championships with a time of 29:44.24 and was crowned the NCAA South Region Cross 
Country Champion, a first for the 
program since Steve Zieminski carried home the award in 2004.And he has not slowed down.
“Mark Parrish has looked phe-
nomenal in practice,” Spangler 
said. 
“He looks the fittest I’ve ever 
seen him.”
And while Spangler wants 
nothing but success for Parrish, it is clear that the coach is focused 
on the training his current run-
ners are doing.
Redshirt sophomore Mac 
Reynolds, determined to improve 
on a solid freshman campaign, 
opened the season strong by win-ning his first collegiate race at the Western Carolina Invitational on Aug. 30. 
With his previous highest fin-ish being fourth with 15:31.60 at 
the FLRunners.com 5k last year, 
Reynolds eclipsed that mark by nearly 18 seconds in Cullowhee, N.C., with a time of 15:13.75.
“I’m very pleased with the 
job Mac did, he’s somebody who came in here as a freshman and worked extremely hard every single day,” Spangler said. 
“We saw a little bit during 
track season, him starting to break through to the next level, and now we are starting to see 
the results of his hard work with 
much more consistent perfor-mances.”
For the women’s team that fin-
ished third at last year’s Moun-
tain Dew Invitational, improve-
ment will be expected for the young team.
The Gators are without their 
two runners who finished in the top six last year: Agata Strausa, who graduated, and then-sopho-more Julie Macedo, who is away from the team this year for per-
sonal reasons.
Instead, the team will rely 
on dynamic performances from 
freshman Lauren Brasure, red-
shirt freshman Becky Greene and 
sophomore Taylor Tubbs. 
Tubbs and redshirt junior 
Macy Huskey were the only two Gator women still on the roster to 
finish in the top 20 at last year’s

Forget everything said about Georgia being the new 
frontrunner to win the Southeastern Conference East-
ern Division. South Carolina — two weeks after being walloped by Texas A&M at home — pulled out a gutsy 38-35 win at home to stay alive in the SEC East race.
Following all the SEC East games on Saturday, Flor-
ida was the top team in the East. Its first-place ranking was earned despite needing triple overtime to stave off Kentucky — a team Florida has beat 28 consecutive years.
That is not exactly encouraging for Florida fans, 
who will watch their team travel to Tuscaloosa to take on the No. 3 Alabama on Saturday.
Besides Florida, Missouri is the only undefeated 
team in the East that hasn’t been talked about. 
Without defensive ends Michael Sam and Kony 
Ealy — and no Dorial Green-Beckham on offense — the Tigers are quietly beating teams. 
Missouri opens SEC play with a road game against 
South Carolina on Sept. 27. Remember, no one was talking about this team much until the end of last sea-son when they found themselves atop the SEC East and made it to Atlanta.
The SEC West has talent across the board: It would 
not be surprising if the SEC West champion has two 
division losses come the SEC Championship in Decem-
ber. 
The current AP Poll has five SEC West teams 
ranked among the top-10 teams — No. 3 Alabama, No. 5 Auburn, No. 6 Texas A&M, No. 8 LSU and No. 10 Ole Miss. The highest ranked team from the SEC East is Georgia, which is somehow sitting ahead of South 
Carolina at No. 13.
The first four SEC West teams easily have the tal-ent to contend for a College Football Playoff, but hav-
ing more losses from playing in a gauntlet of a divi-sion could hurt their chances. Ole Miss could surprise people in their matchup at home against Alabama in a few weeks. The Rebels will likely still be undefeated heading into the week six matchup.
Puzzling Losses Put Question Marks Above 
Teams: Virginia Tech, which went into Columbus, 
Ohio, and upset then-No. 4 Ohio State in Week 2, com-pletely flopped at home to follow the upset win by inexplicably losing to an unranked East Carolina. The Hokies’ loss makes OSU look even worse, and perhaps hurts their chances at getting back in the playoff to rep-resent the Big Ten.
Louisville went on the road to Virginia that came 
into the game with a 10-game FBS losing streak and lost by a field goal thanks to a muffed punt on their own 25. The Cards were the new favorites to win the Atlan-tic Coast Conference Coastal Division following their week one win over Miami.
USC, which beat a talented Stanford team on the 
road in week three to give them the No. 9 ranking, fol-lowed it up by getting upset on the road by unranked 
Boston College. The Pac-12 now looks even more fa-
vorable for Oregon moving forward.
Who Are You?: Notre Dame, which shut out Michi-
gan, did win in week four, but they had difficulty pull-ing out a 14-point victory over a bad Purdue team in Indianapolis. The notion that the Irish are the one team that can upset Florida State this season looks a little less promising following the underwhelming perfor-mance.
And UCLA, 2014’s sleeper playoff pick heading into 
the year, barely beat a Texas team that had been beaten by a combined 65 points in weeks one and two. Not to mention they lost starting quarterback Brett Hundley (elbow) in the first quarter.Notebook: SEC has talent, upsets highlight Week 3He is competing as an individualwell as how to evaluate and develop tal-
ent. 
Muschamp brings Saban’s tricks of the 
trade to Florida like teaching cornerbacks to shufﬂ  e step rather than back peddle, how to play pattern-matching zone and the robber variation of cover 3 defense.
“A lot of things, just from total program 
management,” Muschamp said. “We’d talk in terms of evaluation of players and I learned a lot at the Miami Dolphins as well in that situation from our scouting 
department. But just philosophically, hav-
ing an idea of what you want to be on of-fense and defense and special teams as a program. All of the things that I think are 
critical moving forward and where we’re 
at.”
Secondary remedies: There were mul-
tiple lapses in coverage, numerous mis-communications and fundamental mis-
takes leading to Kentucky quarterback 
Patrick Towles’ all-out aerial assault on the Florida Gators Saturday night to the tune of 369 yards. 
On the bright side for UF,  Muschamp 
sees all the issues as correctable.
“173 yards on six plays and you can’t 
afford that and win games moving for-ward in those situations,” Muschamp 
said. “But there were some things that 
are very correctable from a fundamental technique standpoint of how we play the 
slot and some things that are all correct-
able issues, they’re not things that can’t be corrected.”ERICA A. HERNANDEZ

Defensive end Dominique 
Easley secured his ﬁ  rst inter-
ception as a Patriot on Sun-day when New England beat the Minnesota Vikings 30-7.
Easley’s fourth-quarter 
interception off a pass from Vikings’ quarterback Matt Cassel was one of four for the Patriots. 
“It happened pretty 
quick,” Easley told The Prov-idence Journal. “Just seeing the ball up in the air, and I 
did everything I could to try 
to get to it.”
Safety Matt Elam, a 2013 
UF graduate, tied his career high and led the Ravens with 10 tackles on Thursday. Bal-timore bounced back in the wake of the Ray Rice domes-tic abuse scandal, to defeat 
the Pittsburgh Steelers 26-6. 
Elam’s 10 tackles is just two shy of his collegiate high of 12, which he set against LSU in 2011.
Not-So-Perfect Percy: Se-
attle Seahawks wide receiver Percy Harvin completed a controversial 51-yard touch-
down against the San Diego 
Chargers on Sunday. Har-vin’s ﬁ  rst-quarter touch-down play was called good on the ﬁ  eld, though Twitter soon erupted with contra-dicting opinions. 
On Monday, the NFL is-
sued a statement saying the 
call on the ﬁ  eld was incor-
rect.
“The touchdown was in-
correctly conﬁ  rmed, and as a result, the game was not stopped,” said the NFL’s re-lease. “Had the game been stopped for a replay review, the touchdown would have been reversed because Har-vin stepped out of bounds at the San Diego 21-yard line.”
Though Harvin’s touch-
down gave Seattle a 7-3 lead, it was not enough and San Diego charged back to claim a 30-21 victory.
The Power of Three: 
Three Gators contributed to Sunday’s St. Louis Rams win over the Tampa Bay Bucca-neers. 
Rams cornerback Mar-
cus Roberson recorded one tackle and ended up on the winning side of Sunday’s 19-17 close game. For the Bucs, former Gators wide receiver Solomon Patton returned three kicks for 71 yards. Safe-ty Major Wright also logged 
a tackle.
Gators out of Commis-
sion: Of the 32 Gators listed 
on NFL rosters that had games this past Thursday and Sunday, nine did not play due to injury, tempo-rary suspension or practice squad status. 
Broncos linebacker Leren-
tee McCray suffered a knee injury in the ﬁ  rst quarter of Denver’s 24-17 win over the Kansas City Chiefs. New York Jets outside linebacker Jermaine Cunningham re-mains on injured reserve with a torn Achilles.
Washington Redskins 
tight end Jordan Reed contin-ues to treat an injured ham-string, which he sustained against Houston during the ﬁ  rst game of the season. Reed told CSN Washington that he is frustrated with the string of injuries that have 
plagued his ﬁ  rst two profes-
sional seasons. In the past, Reed suffered a concussion and a quad injury.
“All three injuries I’ve 
had are just kind of ﬂ  uke things, it just kind of hap-pens, nothing I could really do,” Reed said. “I just got to let (the hamstring injury) take its course and work hard on coming back as I fast 
as I can.”
Despite his absence, 
Washington defeated Jack-
sonville 41-10 on Sunday in Maryland.
