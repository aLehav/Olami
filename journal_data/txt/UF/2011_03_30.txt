FREEPORT, Texas — It’s the catch of a life-
time, but it’s not clear whether a Texas fisher -
man landed an 8-foot shark or it landed him.
Jason Kresse, 29, of Freeport, and two crew 
members had been fishing for red snapper 
about 50 miles into the Gulf of Mexico and were dumping fish guts into the water about 3:45 a.m. Monday when they heard two big splashes in the distance.
“All of a sudden something hit the side of 
the boat,” Kresse said. “He ends up landing on the back of the boat.”
The mako shark had apparently been in a 
rush to feed. It began thrashing around, and Kresse said he and his crew couldn’t get close to the 375-pound fish to toss it back in the wa-ter. It damaged the boat before dying several hours later.
“I’m going to get a mount of it,” Kresse 
said. “A fish jumping in your boat, 400 pounds, that’s unbelievable.”

n THE PROPOSED 
RENOVATION WOULD COST $110 MILLION.
By HANNAH WINSTON

Planners have come up with 
a proposal to renovate and ex-
pand the Reitz Union, but they still don’t have the money to put it into action.
The proposed $110 million 
renovation of the 44-year-old student union would expand the building to be suitable for the more than 50,000 students. Be-cause it is still unknown where the funding will come from, the project still does not have a pre-dicted start or finish time. 
“We’ve known there’s been 
a need for a long time,” said Mi-chael Mironack, director of oper -
ations for the Reitz Union. “Now we have a really solid plan and really solid list of needs, so we’re hopeful the administration will 
see that.” 
The next step is to figure out 
how to pay for everything.
TJ Villamil, Student Body treasurer-elect, said it is still too 
early to say how the project will be funded. 
“[We’re in] such early stages 
that nothing has been discussed,” he said.
He said a funding committee 
will be put together consisting of students and administrators to discuss how to fund the expan-sion and renovation.
Of the nearly 10,000 students 
who voted in the spring 2010 SG elections, about 55 percent voted against imposing a student fee to help pay for the expansion.
So far, officials have said they 
will keep the students’ opinions about the fee in mind as they search for ways to fund construc-tion.
The new building would have 
a central focus on a student life center that would house student services like Multicultural and 
Diversity Affairs and the Cen-
ter for Student Activities and Involvement. There will also be larger meeting rooms, studios for dance groups and the entire building would be LEED certi-
fied, meaning that the building Reitz expansion 
lacks funding

Members of the Freshman Leader -

floor Tuesday night with an outpouring 
of concern about a bill that would have combined the group with other student outreach programs on campus.
Student Body President-elect Ben 
Meyers and Vice President-elect An-thony Reynolds, members of the Unite Party, tried to explain that the bill would not get rid of FLC.
Reynolds said the proposed New Stu-

When Tricia Downing completed an 
Ironman triathlon, she made history. She 
was the first female to complete the 2.4-
mile swim, 112-mile bike ride and 26.2-mile run without the use of her legs. 
Accent has partnered with Women’s 
History Month to bring Downing to the Reitz Union Grand Ballroom on Wednes-day at 8 p.m. The speech is free and open to the public. 
Downing was a competitive cyclist 
from 1997 to 2000. On Sept. 17, 2000, while training in Golden, Colo., she was hit head-on by a car and paralyzed from the chest down. 
Downing was discharged from the hospital in January 2001.  Six months later she completed her first race with her disability.
Since her accident, Downing has com-
pleted more than 15 marathons as well 
as triathlons ranging from sprints to Iron-man triathlons. 
Downing will tell 
her story about be-coming a paraplegic and how she turned 
her physical challeng-
es into a success, Ac-
cent chief of staff Corey Portnoy said.

n THE STATE IS TRYING TO 
TERMINATE HER PARENTAL RIGHTS.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
A judge ordered a Michigan wom-
an to spend a year in jail Tuesday for 
scamming thousands of dollars from donors by drugging her 12-year-old son to make him appear to have can-
cer — a sentence that her family com-
plained was too lenient.
Carol Schnuphase, 47, pleaded 
no contest in February to charges of second-degree child abuse and act-ing under false pretenses. On Tues-day , she apologized for her actions in Macomb County Circuit Court before Judge Richard Caretti announced he 
would send her to the county jail.
“Your conduct, ma’am, in this case 
is reprehensible. To tell a vulnerable, 
defenseless young boy that he is dy-ing of cancer for your own pecuniary gain is almost beyond the realm of comprehension,” said Caretti, who based his sentence on a deal reached with Schnuphase’s lawyer. “To then 
give your son strong opiate-based 
pills crushed up in his apple sauce to further your despicable scheme defies all reason.”
The defendant’s aunt, Lorraine 
Kelsch, said after the sentencing that 
the family had wanted Schnuphase to 
be sentenced to five years in prison.
“My reaction is disgust,” Kelsch 
said. “That sentence stinks. It’s hor -
rible.”
Prosecutors said a hospital tested 
the boy , who is now 13, and declared him cancer-free, although he was go-ing through opiate withdrawal.
Defense attorney Dominic Greco, 
however, said Schnuphase denies having given her son “opiates of any kind.
“There are other ways for the test 
being false,” he said, pointing to the 
possibility that the medication Schnu-phase was giving her son to combat 
acid reflux may have resulted “in a false positive.”
As for the other accusations, Greco 
said Schnuphase admits telling her son he had leukemia.
Greco said his client’s actions 
were out of character and may have stemmed in part from her husband’s death and the recent loss of her job.
Prosecutors said Schnuphase last 
year solicited donations from individ-uals, groups and members of at least one church who believed they were helping to pay for her son’s medi-cal care. She received $7,500 from a church fundraiser, in addition to other donations, and her son was given 
gifts, including an Xbox video game 
system.
Caretti ordered Schnuphase to pay 
more than $10,000 in restitution to the church, Roseville Community Schools and others who gave her money. He also gave her credit for 179 days of time served and ordered her to serve three years of probation. 
The state is trying to terminate 
Schnuphase’s parental rights to the boy, who now is in foster care. A hear -
ing on the matter is scheduled for April 15.

Members of the UF Greek community served up 
mountainous piles of poultry and baked goods Tuesday 
for the Chicken Wing Charity Thing.
The 26 Interfraternity Council chapters and 16 Panhal-
lenic Council sororities raised $6,000 for Children’s Mira-cle Network at Shands Children’s Hospital, $1,000 more than last year. 
CMN is a nonprofit organization dedicated to raising 
money to give to children’s hospitals across the country.
Each fraternity served a pan of 800 wings, totaling 
20,800 varieties including nuclear hot, southern spice, na-ked buffalo and chicken parmesan. 
Each sorority baked a dessert, including chocolate-chip 
Oreo cookies, fruit pizza, cinnamon rolls and red velvet cake. 
All entries were judged by a panel. Sigma Kappa Sorority’s red velvet cake won for a sec-
ond time, while Sigma Alpha Epsilon Fraternity won for 
its wing assortment. 
Nancy Chrystal-Green, director of the UF 
Center for Student Activities and Involvement, was a judge.
“I’m really proud of the Greek community for doing 
this event,” she said.
Corey Portnoy, executive vice president of the Interfra-
ternity Council, said he was proud of the turnout. 
“We hope this is something that will continue for 
years,” he said.
Calvin Lee, 18, a beneficiary of CMN, took the stage 
of the bandshell at Flavet Field to thank the 1,200 chicken wing-eaters for their contributions. 
Lee spent much of his childhood at Shands Children’s 
Hospital enduring dialysis for his renal disease. He went through 62 surgeries and finally received a successful kid-ney transplant seven years ago from his mother. 
Lee is a senior on the Eastside High School wrestling 
team and was the strongest in his weight class this year. Four years ago doctors told him he wouldn’t be able to wrestle at all. 
“If it weren’t for the Children’s Miracle Network,” he 
said, “I would not be here today.”Wing contest

Student Body Vice President Marcus Dixon speaks at the Student Senate meeting in the Reitz Union on 
Tuesday night. The new budget for the 2011-2012 school year was unveiled during the meeting.
Proposed $16.7 million SG budget for the upcoming year was presented
as well as introduce members to 
the ins and outs of SG.
Senators and FLC members 
alike expressed their concern about whether or not the bill could lead to drastic changes to how the council is run and orga-
nized.
After an amendment was 
made to the bill, which kept FLC 
a singular entity and not part of a new cabinet, it passed unani-
mously. 
Student Body President Ash-
ton Charles, Vice President Mar -
cus Dixon and Senator Christina Bonarrigo, all representatives of 
the Unite Party, wrote the amend-ment that let FLC remain exactly the same. 
“If it’s not broken, why should 
we break it?” argued Bonnarrigo during public debate.
TJ Villamil, the Student Body 
treasurer-elect,  stood against the 
bill. 
He said he feared FLC would 
not function identically as it had if the bill was passed.
“You know how important it 
is,” he said. ”I’m not convinced 
that FLC will be the same.”
Charles had to run across cam-
pus in heels to make the meeting, but still missed the unanimous vote. 
She was very excited to hear 
that the bill was passed with the amendment.
“Glad that the senators were 
able to do the right thing tonight,” she said after the meeting. 
Dixon said he hoped the new 
student leaders would see how 
large and ben-
eficial FLC is 
by itself.
Also during 
the meeting, Villamil presented 
the new SG budget for the up-
coming fiscal year. 
The SG budget totals to about 
$16.7 million in activity and ser -
vices fees, which are paid by all 
students.

TALLAHASSEE — The Republican-con-
trolled House turned back a move Tuesday 
by Democrats to block the wholesale shift of Florida’s Medicaid program to private com-panies and networks of hospitals and other 
health care providers.
That vote was a preview of debate and a 
roll call scheduled for Thursday on a pair of 
GOP-sponsored bills (HB7107, HB 7109) that would require managed care for all 2.9 million participants in the state-federal health care program — 51 percent of them children.
Republicans say contracting with health 
management organizations and provider net-
works would reduce rapidly rising expenses 
for the fraud-plagued, program that cov-ers low-income and disabled people. It costs about $20 billion now and is forecast to grow to $28 billion by 2014-15.
“The program is unsustainable,” said Rep. 
Robert Schenck, a Spring Hill Republican who is sponsoring the legislation.
Democrats, though, challenged the pre-
sumption that managed care will save money and argued that HMOs sometimes deny pa-tients needed care.
Rep. Mark Pafford, D-West Palm Beach, of-
fered an amendment that would have given patients the choice of participating in managed care or the conventional fee-for-service plan.
That would have included patients in an 
existing five-county experiment in managed 
care.
Pafford’s proposal also would have set re-
porting and accountability requirements for 
managed care providers as well as penalties for those that don’t measure up.“I want to protect poor people that are get-
ting Medicaid,” Pafford said. “Also, it’s a great way to ensure that the private managed care folks are accountable with that $20 billion we are going to provide them.”
His amendment failed on a voice vote after 
Schenck said it would undo efforts to overhaul the system.
Managed care legislation also is moving in 
the Senate, also with a Republican majority , but the chambers differ on some of the details.
One key difference is that the House would 
divide the state into eight managed care re-gions while the Senate has proposed 19. Man-aged care providers would bid for contracts to provide services within a region.
The House also rejected a proposal by Rep. 
Janet Cruz, D-Tampa, for 11 regions. Cruz said her plan would reduce the size of some re-gions that are so big some patients might have to travel up to 200 miles for care.
Schenck argued her proposal would have 
made some of the regions too small to be at-tractive to bidders.
Besides the state legislation, a statewide 
managed care expansion would need approv-al from the federal government, which picks up most of the program’s cost.
The Senate bill includes a provision that 
would go to a scaled-down, state-only pro-gram if the federal government denies the waiver. That would cost Floridians about $12 billion in federal money.

 THE JAIL NEEDS RENOVATIONS 
TO HEATING AND COOLING UNITS AS WELL AS THE ROOF.
By MEREDITH RUTLAND
Alligator Writer 
The commission chair rapped his 
knuckles on the table to quiet the quarrel-
ing voices.
“I guess we’re not going to see a final 
decision today,” said Rick Drummond, assistant county manager to the Alachua County Commission.
There was disagreement in an Alach-
ua County Commission meeting Tuesday about how to renovate the county jail, which is said to be more or less falling apart.
Specifically, the commission discussed 
how much money to spend on the cool-ing and heating units as well as repairs to the roof.
The commission was given three price 
options. In three of the four, the project exceeds its original budget. 
From the $7.7 million the county took 
out to cover jail renovations, $5.8 million remains. The price options: $9.7 million, $6.9 million, $6.8 million and $5.3 million. 
Commissioners are less than thrilled with 
this.
“Essentially, it’s just wasting money,” 
said Chair Lee Pinkoson. “I am not in fa-vor of spending $9.8 million on this proj-ect.”
The commission decided to ask staff to 
get more information, including what ad-ditions were made that increased the proj-
ect’s cost. One of the additions includes 
the installation of new 
air conditioning units instead of refurbishing the current ones.
The jail needs new, 
and pricier, air condi-
tioning units “whether the county wanted to or 
not,” said Charlie Jack-
son, facilities manager.
Mike West, an engineer with Ad-
vanTek Consulting,  disagreed.
“With all due respect, Charlie,” West 
said, “I don’t think that’s correct.”
County staff will present more infor -
mation to the commissioners on April 12. They are hoping to be able to fund the 
jail’s unit and roof repairs while staying 
in budget and also having energy-saving features.No decision on fixing jail

The trolley that trails around the Give 
Kids the World Village doesn’t have an ar -
bitrary name.
Years ago, after a little boy made a wish 
to be a train, he received a conductor hat, a 
whistle and a group that followed him all 
around. 
He was able to get his wish before he 
died, because the volunteers at the village wanted to give him the world.
The village named the trolley after him.Members of the Rotaract club at UF are 
volunteering at the Give Kids the World Village this weekend to help make termi-
nally ill children’s wishes come true.
About 20 members of Rotaract, a club 
committed to community service, usu-
ally go twice per year to the Give Kids the World Village in Kissimmee.“When you volunteer there, the impact 
you make on so many families is unforget-table,” said John Kelly, the club’s presi-dent.
The Give Kids the World Village, which 
was created in 1989, is a 70-acre resort with more than 140 villas and special features. The sole purpose of the village is to cater to the needs of the Make-A -Wish Foundation children whose wishes involve any aspect 
of the theme parks in the Or -
lando area, according to the organization’s website.
“It’s kind of like a gated 
community but fairytale style,” said UF student Jesse Schmitt, the international chairman of Rotaract.

As is the case with 
many of our con-stantly evolving 
technological develop-ments, our legal system hasn’t quite caught up to the capabilities of current 
cellphones and the phe-
nomena they spawn. 
As such, the system has 
been punishing minors who sext — even with their 
significant others — like a 
type of sex offender. 
State Sen. Charlie Dean 
is trying to change that 
with a bill that’s working 
its way through the Florida legislature. 
The current gray area of 
the law neglects to differ -
entiate between a 16-year-old sending his girlfriend a racy photo and an adult distributing child porn to 
the public. It’s a disconnect that can 
ruin minors’ lives with one 
stupid mistake. That’s why 
the proposed softer penal-
ties make sense to us.
We’re in no way con-
doning the actions some of 
these teens take. But to be 
labeled and effectively out-cast from society seems like too harsh a penalty for the given crime. 
It’s important to remem-
ber that from time to time, we have to re-examine the current laws and realize 
what isn’t clear or accurate, 
and Sen. Dean is trying to do just that. 
This re-evaluation keeps 
our system up-to-date and, 
in this case, will help pre-
vent a stupid teenage mis-take from leading to a life-time of undeserved stigma 
and shame.Damage Control

hope was snuffed out for many Virginia Tech students fol-lowing the infamous 2007 shooting, and the Department of Education is trying to send campus officials a message with a $55,000 fine in return. 
The two-hour delay the university took in notifying the 
campus about the killer is inexcusable.
 In the time it took university officials to compose and 
send an email vaguely warning about two murders in a dor -
mitory, the shooter had made his way into a campus class -
room and was preparing to kill 30 more people. In fact, the email merely mentioned a shooting on campus, omitting the 
fact that the victims had died while their murderer was no-
where to be found.
In the face of such depressing facts, you might think the 
university would tuck its tail between its legs, accept the fine and promise something like the tragedy will never happen again on its campus. 
You’d be wrong.Instead, the university is appealing the fine in an attempt 
to dodge the blame for the 32 people killed that day. No, of-ficials didn’t pull the trigger, but an earlier and more honest warning was warranted and may have helped saved some of lives lost. 
It’s disgusting how far a public relations battle can go, es-
pecially considering that we’d rather go to a university that admits and makes efforts to right its wrongs rather than one that tries to sidestep the consequences of its actions.
Market can’t keep up with law grads
There’s no way around it, because no matter where you turn or how much you try to ignore it, the U.S. is seeing some tough economic times. Yet, despite 
the fact that job growth in many sectors is slow, law schools seem to be doing nothing less than ignoring this fact and hammering away at the idea that going to law school is a great idea.
Though the concept it sells is quite appealing, this 
may not be entirely true. Come to law school, and, de-spite the often-faced six-figure debt at the end of the road, don’t worry too much because you’ll be making 
plenty of money for the rest of your life to pay it off and 
live the American dream.
The reality is that the job market in this sector is vastly 
oversupplied. According to the Washington Monthly, 
there are about 45,000 graduates annually vying for less 
than 30,000 legal jobs. Those numbers are not too appeal-
ing, and yet law schools sell degrees to future juris doc-
tors like hotcakes. 
I tried being an attorney once. In high school I par -
ticipated in a program called Youth in Government and opted to be defense counsel, arguing for a defendant in front of a mock Florida Supreme Court. 
I remember spending countless hours at the local law 
library looking up cases relevant to my own, hunting down statutes that would help define my position and preparing a brief impervious to the scrutiny of those desk-pounding state attorneys. I also remember thinking to myself that this kind of work is awful and gee, some-one would have to pay me a lot of money to do this day in and day out.
I recognize and acknowledge that this was most cer -
tainly much different from practicing real law, and that many people very much enjoy that type of work. I know plenty of law students, and I do get the sense from many of them they are satisfied with their hard work transform-
ing into a practiced craft. However, I rarely see them jumping for joy at the thought of their next assignment. Mostly, I hear a lot of complaining about how heavy the books are and note how much more jaded their tone be-comes as they wrestle another year of law school under their belt. The financial security that comes with having a law degree is a large, attractive motivator in deciding on 
whether or not to pursue a career in the legal field. Now, 
however, the debt taken on by pursuing said path is get-
ting riskier every year.
But there is a silver lining. It is directed at the rest of us 
non-legal types. All this competition and pressure com-
ing from law graduates descending upon the legal sector 
means competition for the incumbent employees whose 
very jobs are being vied for. That means driving down the costs of legal fees or getting better quality service than otherwise for the same price. This isn’t too appealing for the graduates, however, as they face tougher competition with potentially lower wages to fight over. Given the fact that they often start their careers with large amounts of debt, the situation again looks less appealing. 
I remember hearing a law joke once that goes some-
thing like this: In law school, those who make A’s be-come professors, those who make B’s become judges and those who make C’s make a lot of money. 
That punchline is apparently becoming less and less 
true for the many fresh JDs trying to break into job mar -
ket every year.

In response to a modest proposal
Kendra Vincent’s Monday letter is absolutely right: Wom-
en’s rights are under attack. Yet the danger is far greater than 
she acknowledges. What our state legislature threatens to-morrow unfair laws against infanticide limit now.
Infanticide involves a woman’s basic right to control her 
own time and the direction of her life. No restrictions on these rights are reasonable.
It’s a right connected to all other things in their lives. Rais-
ing children is physically and mentally dangerous, hard work that involves risks men rarely help to face, and women should be able to decide whether or not they want to keep doing it.
Unruly toddlers and rebellious teenagers encumber a 
woman’s control over her life far more than pregnancy, yet bigoted men dare require her to raise what the whim of nature 
thrust upon her. Why should a woman’s right to terminate her 
progeny cease after birth? She brought it into the world, and she must be able to take it out as soon as it hinders her life.
All women should have the right to infanticide at any time 
for any reason, regardless of laws, ethics or any other hurdles. Women have the right to decide when and if they will raise children, and that includes changing their minds after they started. 
Andrew Robb
UF studentLetter to the Editor
As a young American, it is nice to hear my leaders 
say that they have my generation’s best interests at 
heart. In the midst of the ongoing budget battle in 
Washington, the one point that both Democrats and Repub-
licans seem to agree on is that they don’t want to burden future generations of Americans with crushing debt.
Speaker John Boehner recently said, “It is immoral to 
bind our children to as leeching and destructive a force as 
debt,” and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has said, “Our 
children and grandchildren are counting on us to chart an effective course toward responsible stewardship of the public purse.” But what programs are they proposing to 
cut to achieve this end? While I appreciate their solicitude, 
I am concerned that America’s leaders are jeopardizing my generation’s future in the name of fiscal austerity.
The budget passed by House Republicans included a 
$5.7 billion cut to the Pell Grants program, a nearly $900 
million cut to the Office of Science budget, a more than $1 
billion cut from Head Start and severe cuts to dozens of other educational programs. The Democratic-controlled Senate may reject some of these cuts, but the desire to 
make large spending cuts with little regard for their long-term impact is strong on both sides 
in Washington.
While Congress considers cut-
ting education, America’s businesses 
are projecting an increased demand for a more educated workforce. According to a recent report from Georgetown University’s Center on Education and the Workforce, our 
colleges and universities will have to increase the number 
of degrees they confer by 10 percent annually, through 2018, in order to meet demand. 
Education is nearly a requirement in some of our na-
tion’s fastest-growing industries, such as information ser -
vices, professional and business services and health care, in which 75 to 90 percent of workers have at least some higher education.
The bottom line is that America should be spending 
more on education, not less. 
Can we afford to increase spending on anything given 
the massive federal budget deficit? I would argue we can’t afford not to.
Investments in education are just that, investments 
that yield high returns. A dollar spent on an effective edu-cational program yields significantly more than its cost through future increased economic output. The rest of the world knows this, which is why China and India have both dramatically increased the amount of money they 
spend on educational programs.
Let’s be clear about the debate over the deficit. In the 
short term, America’s economy will function normally re-
gardless of whether we operate with a large budget defi-cit or a small one, so the entire argument is over what is 
in our nation’s long-term best interest. Will America re-
ally be better off with balanced budgets in 20 years if our workforce is less educated and ill-prepared for the global economy of the 21st century?
President Obama has called for new national priorities 
based on “winning the future,” but most members of Con-gress seem more intent on cutting the future. If leaders in Washington truly want to advocate for my generation’s best interests, they should spend less time pinching pen-
nies and more time making the investments necessary to 
build a stronger America.

“It’s not just the matter of having 
a pretty building; it’s filling needs,” Mironack said.
He said that originally the union 
was built for 19,000 students, a num-ber that has more than doubled in the past 50 years. 
“We’ve made a lot of changes,” 
Mironack said.  “But if you think about what’s been added and what’s been changed, we haven’t made a lot of room for student organiza-
tions and activities.” 
One of the models officials looked 
at was the University of South Flori-
da’s Marshall Student Center.
The USF building cost $65 mil-
lion and was built in two years, after nearly 10 years of planning.
According to Joe Synovec, direc-
tor of the Marshall Student Center, it 
was funded by a student fee of $20 
per semester and $1.50 added to each credit hour for all students. The fee will be charged for  30 years to pay off the building. He said students use “every nook and cranny” of the center, and food sales sales increased from $1 million to $5 million.
The renovations to the Reitz 
Union are not only necessary to make it more convenient and acces-sible to students but also because the building is more than 40 years old.8, ALLIGATOR n WEDNESDAY, MARCH 30, 2011

the school is having a hard time finding the funds to begin the project.

Mountain Sports Magazine. She won the 
Sportswomen of Colorado Inspiration Award 
in 2003 and the Sportswomen of Colorado Tri-
athlon Award in 2005 for outstanding sports performance.
Her speech will focus on the idea that any-
thing can be accomplished with enough de-termination, Portnoy said. 
Following her speech, Downing will an-
swer questions from the audience, he said. 
Downing said she likes talking to college students because her message is applicable to people at a crossroad in their lives. 
She described her accident 
as happening at an intersection. 
She was hit at the crossroad of 
two streets and then everything 
changed. College is an intersection between childhood and adulthood, she said, when ev-erything is about to change.  
College often brings unexpected setbacks, 
she said. 
She wants to help students prepare for 
challenges that may arise and teach them ways to overcome them. ACCENT , from page 1

n THE SENIOR HAS BEEN A PART OF TEAM 
MEETINGS AND WALKTHROUGHS THIS SPRING.
By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
aberry@alligator.org
 
Jeff Demps isn’t practicing with the football team this spring, 
but he is by no means out of the running for a starting spot in 
Florida’s backfield.
Demps recently wrapped up the indoor track and field sea-
son with an NCAA title in the 60-meter sprint while helping 
Florida to a national championship. Demps is now gearing up 
for the Gators’ outdoor track season, hoping to add a few more 
titles to his mantle before he returns to football full-time.
Focusing on two sports might appear physically demand-
ing, and simultaneously trying to pick up on the Gators’ new 
offense might seem mentally exhausting, but it hasn’t been a 
problem for Demps so far.
Florida coach Will Muschamp said Tuesday that Demps 
has been a part of all of the team’s meetings and walkthroughs, and he hopes the seven-on-seven workouts in the summer will get him back in football shape before fall practice.
“Mentally, he has an idea of what we’re going to ask him 
to do in the fall,” Muschamp said. “He’ll be involved in that, and when we start camp in August, he’ll be competing for the 
starting job.
“He was able to bring another national championship to the 
University of Florida. I have a hard time telling the guy he can’t 
run track. I think that’s pretty selfish.”
Demps will be on the same level as nearly everyone except 
running back Chris Rainey when fall practice begins, as the rest 
of the Gators’ running back corps has been decimated by inju-
ries this spring.Freshman Mike Blakely will miss all of spring after under -
going shoulder surgery , and junior Mike Gillislee is out with a 
stress fracture in his foot. On top of those injuries, Muschamp 
said Tuesday that sophomore Mack Brown broke his fibula and will have surgery Wednesday, keeping him out for three months.
As a result, Rainey has been taking most of the reps at run-

to the Seminoles. Despite that, FSU still maintained its series dominance against 
UF at neutral sites.
For the first time in three meetings this 
season, No. 7 Florida State (19-6) scored 
runs in multiple innings as it topped No. 4 Florida (21-5) 5-2 on Tuesday night in Jacksonville and UF dropped its third game in five days.
“We got off to a decent start,” UF 
coach Kevin O’Sullivan said. “It’s obvi-
ous we’re not swinging the bats as well 
as we can right now. 
“Every team goes through this, and I 
think it’s important for us to keep their minds right.”
The win was the Seminoles’ seventh consecutive neutral-site victory over the Gators, dating back to April 1, 2008 – O’Sullivan’s first year as UF’s skipper.
Florida State scattered five runs over 
its last five innings, erasing an early 2-0 
deficit and clinching at least a series split 
against Florida this year.
After the Gators’ Nos. 
1-5 hitters combined 
to go 5 for 51 with nine strikeouts in a series loss to South Carolina last weekend, O’Sullivan 
shook up the batting order, moving 
catcher Mike Zunino to the cleanup spot.
The move paid dividends early, as 
Zunino recorded Florida’s only RBIs of 
the night, finishing the game 1 for 3 with a double and extending his career-high hitting streak to 14 games.
But after getting on the board in the FSU silences UF’s bats‘Football is football,’ and other 
valuable spring practice insights
If you are feeling lucky , drive down SW 
2nd Avenue. 
Don’t linger too long, of course. But 
as you creep down the road, peek through the black iron bars in front of the Sanders Football Practice Field. Maybe, just maybe, you will see what all the fuss is about.
Or you can drive to the top of the 
O’Dome parking lot. Or you can sneak into the bleachers at McKethan Stadium. Or you can paint your face, throw on some camou-
flage and climb the trees across the street. 
Whatever you do, though, just don’t let 
them see you.
Because who do you think you are, try-
ing to check out the football team’s spring practices? 
What? You thought the money you 
spend on season tickets, which pays for 
scholarships and coaching salaries, actually mattered?
There is something more important hap-
pening on those practice fields. The game is being revolutionized. 
Well, actually, I don’t know. I haven’t 
had the guts to get accosted for watching a public school’s foot-ball team. I guess I’m no Hunter S. Thomp-
son. Sorry.
But we’ve heard 
things are differ -
ent. We’ve heard the 
team is switching to 
a pro-style offense. 
We’ve heard the de-fense will run a 4-3 
and a 3-4 and maybe 
everything in between.
Sounds awesome. Really, it does. Only 
problem is, why should we believe any of 
this if we can’t watch?
Will Muschamp said the team needed 
to close practices for “obvious reasons,” presumably to eliminate distractions for his team. But spring practices have never been open for the team. They are open for 
the fans. And, again, it’s the fans who sup-
port the program when they pack the sta-dium, shop at the team store, pay to watch

Florida women’s basketball coach 
Amanda Butler has made the goal of the program perfectly clear.
“We’re not trying to be one of the best. 
We’re not trying to be top five. We’re trying to 
be the best,” Butler said.
Butler is the only coach in Florida history 
to achieve postseason berths in each of her 
first four seasons. But of those four postseason trips, Florida has been to the Big Dance just once. 
The Gators made the NCAA Tournament 
in 2008-09. But they went 17-13 this year in a regular season marred by failures in close 
games and against lesser opponents, and ac-
cepted their second straight bid to the Wom-en’s National Invitation Tournament.
Butler admits there is still work to be done 
but says she doesn’t have a timeline for suc-cess. 
Five players transferred in Butler’s first 
three years as head coach, impeding the Gators’ chances of elevated play . And at least 
two of those players — Tessah Holt and Tru-
mae Lucas — pointed to Butler’s treatment of players, coaching style and anger issues as rea-sons for their departure.
Surprisingly , the intensity and passion that 
made Butler an acclaimed hire in 2007, and not the lack of improvement, might prove to be her downfall. 
n n n
“Coach Butler is the type of person that 
looks for perfection,” Holt said in a recent phone interview. “That can be good at times, but it can be wrong at times.”
Butler, a four-year starter at point guard 
for Florida during the early 1990s, once took a blow to the head and had to get stitches dur -
ing a game. She returned within minutes. 
As a coach, Butler frequently marches out 
onto the court barking instructions at her team and routinely slams water bottles in frustra-tion after a mistake or blown play. Last sea-son, she ruptured her Achilles tendon playing flag football and couldn’t stand on the job, so she used a chair with casters and ferociously wheeled up and down the sideline.
Butler, a part of the first Florida team in 
school history to make the NCAA Tournament, expects that same level of competitiveness from her players. But some say she expects too much and that her aggressive personality can become abrasive, especially when the wins are not piling up.
“You can get sick of it, but she’s the coach, 
and you have to do what she says or you’ll be on the bench,” Holt said.
Or out of town.Holt loved Florida. Her cousin played at 
UF, and she wore the same jersey , No. 12, when she arrived. But she said Butler’s expectations were surprising.
“I felt like freshmen are going to make mis-
takes, so when you come to me and say I don’t have room to make mistakes, I was just like, ‘Wow,’” Holt said.
Current shooting guard and team captain 
Jordan Jones said Butler tends to hold point guards to a higher standard because of her past at the position. Jones said Butler takes the point guards aside for individual work in practice, something she rarely does with other position groups.
“She holds a special place in her heart (for 
point guards), and she definitely demands so 
much,” Jones said. “I have so much respect for 
them for what they kind of, not put up with, but what she demands of them.”
Butler said she doesn’t feel she has an abra-sive personality as a coach and that her play-ers know what to expect from her. 
“I’d really prefer to think that I’m direct. I 
do that out of respect,” Butler said. “They’ve got to know that you love them. They’ve got to know that you care for them. They’ve got 
to know that you’d be willing to do anything 
for them that you can, within the rules, to get a response out of being tough on them.”
The problem is that Butler’s actions make 
her words tough to believe. 
n n n
Infuriated with her team after a first-
round loss to Auburn in the Southeastern 
Conference Tournament last season, Butler 
erupted in the locker room and provided what Holt said was the tipping point in her decision to transfer.
“She broke a whiteboard. … It shat-
tered,” Holt said. “Which is kind of shock-ing to me because … you expect for a coach to hold her temper in or whatever and be the mature person. 
“But when she broke that board, I was 
like, ‘Whoa, wait a minute. Who is this per -
son?’ It was something for me — I wouldn’t say I was scared, but it was just shocking.”
Lucas agreed. She said the act didn’t 
scare her, mainly because it wasn’t the first time Butler had taken her anger out on an inanimate object.
“It was kind of her routine talk after a 
loss,” Lucas said. “Then, all of a sudden, I guess the anger she had built up just kind of came out, and she took it out on the board. I mean, she hit the board. It wasn’t even like the game-board, the clipboard. It was the board in the locker room that they had given us to use. She hit that, and it broke.”
Lucas said Butler also threw a piece of 
jewelry at the wall in a fit of rage. 
Ten days later, Lucas announced her 
decision to transfer. Then, on March 16 and 17, immediately before Florida was to play South Florida in the WNIT, Christal Caldwell and Holt announced their depar -
ture plans.Holt and Caldwell were roommates, 
and  Lucas lived in the same building. But all three insisted they made their decisions individually. 
“We didn’t actually decide together,” Lu-
cas said. “Of course it was a conversation, 
and it wasn’t just a conversation amongst 
us three players.
“I’m pretty sure if I had a conversation 
with one of (the current players) it would spark the conversation of leaving,” Lu-cas continued. “It wasn’t just the three of us that had the talk of leaving, but I don’t want to put anyone else’s name out there. … She’s still there.”
Holt and Lucas listed Butler’s personal-
ity as one of their main reasons for leaving, and that intensity was never more apparent 
than after the loss to Auburn.
Asked if she would say Butler has a 
temper, Jones said, “Yes. I would. Defi-
nitely. …She’s gone through her fair share of boards.”
Fellow captain Azania Stewart tried to 
justify the situation, saying, “Everyone is used to it. She does have a temper on her, but that’s how she’s been her whole Florida career.”
Stewart, Lucas’ roommate, said she nev-
er considered transferring.
“This is my place for the long run,” 
Stewart said. “Florida has done everything for me. So, there’s no way. There are tough times, but I think that’s for the weak. You’ve 
got to put those aside.”
But Stewart also wonders what might 
have been if Lucas was still a Gator.
“If (Lucas) had stayed, I think she 
would’ve been starting for us and contrib-
uted a lot of big minutes and maybe big 
plays,” Stewart said.
Jones said much of the same. 
“I think if she was here, she would have 
such an impact on our team,” Jones said. “We have no experienced guards. I was the only guard returning. This would have been her season.”
Holt, Lucas and Caldwell chose to go 
elsewhere, but they weren’t the only ones to leave the program. 
n n n
Butler didn’t have much recruiting 
to do her first year with returning stars Depree Bowden, Sha Brooks and Marshae Dotson filling out the lineup. She brought in a class featuring Ndidi Madu, Ebonie 
Crawford and Kerri Simpson. 
Simpson transferred after playing just 
2.6 minutes her freshman season.
Next, Butler brought in Lucas, Tai-
lor Jones and Stewart, all highly touted 
recruits. But Tailor Jones transferred to Northwestern after her freshman season, where her sister, Morgan, the high school Central Florida Player of the Year, will be 
joining her next season.
Faced with recruiting the guard posi-
tion heavily, Butler and her staff nabbed 
Caldwell and Holt for the 2009 class.  Again, both were prized recruits with nu-merous accolades to their names. 
In three seasons, five players left Flor -
ida for the presumably greener pastures of Northwestern, Stetson (Simpson), West 
Virginia (Caldwell), Delaware (Lucas) and 
Boston College (Holt). 
However, Butler said it didn’t concern 
her because “that’s something that’s not unique to Florida.”
“I’m not going to coach or be less of me, 
as my staff is not either, because I’m afraid someone’s going to transfer,” Butler said. “If someone can’t see what a tremendous 
opportunity it is to play here and compete 
here and be able to call themselves a Gator, and they think that there is something bet-ter out there to go find, then good luck. 
“Good luck and let me know when you 
come up with that. Because there’s not.
“I don’t think I’m respecting you if I su-
garcoat the truth or if I try to tiptoe around what we need you to do so that I don’t 
hurt your feelings,” Butler continued. 
“That’s how you treat children; that’s not how you treat adults. We want players to act as, play as, compete as women — not little girls.”
However, those who left said they are 
pleased with their decisions. 
Caldwell declined to be interviewed, 
but Holt and Lucas said they couldn’t be 
happier about leaving Florida. At Boston 
College, Holt said she finally has “a coach who really believes in me.”
“(Coach Sylvia Crawley) is always on 
our tail in practice, but she doesn’t cuss me out,” Holt said. “She doesn’t call me out by my name, so it’s like I really have someone that believes in me.”
Lucas echoed that sentiment. But both 
said things could have been different.
“It’s like guaranteed happiness here 
[at Delaware], and I’m not even playing,” Lucas said. “If it wasn’t for that particu-lar coaching staff, I might still be (at Flor -
ida).”
“If I didn’t play basketball,” Holt said, 
“I’d still be going (to Florida) to this day.”WEDNESDAY, MARCH 30, 2011 n ALLIGATOR, 15

Florida coach Amanda Butler chides her players on the sidelines during the Gators’ 
78-63 win against Mississippi State on Feb. 20. Several of Butler’s former players said her personality and occasional fits of anger caused them to transfer from Florida.

n UF WILL TAKE ON USF 
TODAY AT 6 P.M. AT HOME.
By STEPHEN SHEEHAN
Alligator Writer 
 
Three years ago, Megan Bush 
was a developing hitter disguised as 
a shortstop. 
Now, she patrols first base, is 
a rock in the middle of the Gators’ 
talented lineup and will lead No. 5 
Florida (30-4, 7-3 Southeastern Con-ference) against South Florida (19-15, 1-0 Big East) today at 6 p.m. in Pressly Stadium. 
“Megan’s been our most consis-
tent hitter,” UF coach Tim Walton said. “She’s been great, even with two strikes, getting clutch hits for us.” 
Her ability to hit the long ball has 
never been questioned. She knocked 
13 home runs in 74 starts as a fresh-
man, including nine in SEC play . 
However, she struck out 48 times 
and had the lowest batting average (.260) of all starters. 
Over the next two years, she im-proved to .327 and .362 while hitting 16 and 15 home runs, respectively . 
H a l f w a y 
through her se-nior year, she is playing in anoth-er stratosphere. 
Bush ranks 
second only to 
leadoff hitter Mi-
chelle Moultrie with a .453 aver -
age and has already tied her career high with 16 homers. 
Besides her gaudy slugging (1.021) and on-base (.533) percent-ages, the most impressive number is 57 — her NCAA-leading RBI count. 
After knocking in a career-high 
50 runs in 59 games last year, the hot-hitting Bush has  eclipsed that mark through 34 games and is 14 RBIs ahead of fellow senior Kelsey Bruder for first on the team. 
Bush has become more produc-
tive with her outs, as evidenced by her team-high five sacrifice flies. 
Her development as an all-
around hitter couldn’t have come at a better time, as the team lost Fran-cesca Enea, UF’s all-time home run leader, to graduation last year. 
But with the way Bush is hitting, 
the record books are about to be re-written. 
With 60 career home runs, Bush 
only needs two to break Enea’s total and five to break her single-season record of 20.  
Although it would be quite an ac-
complishment, the senior doesn’t get caught up in the talk about records. 
“It doesn’t cross my mind,” she 
said. “It won’t make me or break me as a player.”
Bush putting up career numbers in senior season
ning back, and Florida has even 
used Trey Burton as a third-down back for protection purposes.
“Those guys needed reps, need-
ed spring. It’s unfortunate, but that’s 
what happened. We’ll deal with it 
and move on,” Muschamp said. 
“That’s where we are, and that’s what we’ve got to work through. 
We’re just a little thin there.”
BALL UNDERGOES PROCEDURE:  
Sophomore linebacker Neiron 
Ball (congenital syndrome) under -
went a procedure Tuesday, and Muschamp said he is going to be healthy.
Ball was hospitalized in Febru-
ary after a blood vessel in his brain 
ruptured, and although he will not 
be with the team this spring, Mus-
champ said Ball has handled the 
situation as well as he could.
“I’m not worried about his foot-
ball future,” Muschamp said. “I’m 
worried about his overall health.”Ball getting

first inning, Florida’s bats went silent, re-
cording just one more hit over the final eight innings. The Gators tied a season low with only three hits for the second time in three games.
“Hitting is definitely contagious, whether 
you’re swinging the bat really well or wheth-er you’re not,” Zunino said. “And right now, we’re not swinging the bats too well, and it’s contagious.”
For Florida State’s pitchers, it was a fa-
miliar game plan against Florida: throw breaking balls. The strategy was effective 
once again, as Florida struck out nine times 
and only twice advanced runners past sec-ond base on the night.
“They were just spin-
ning the ball, and we just weren’t seeing the ball,” Zunino said. “We swung at some bad pitches, and we just couldn’t lay off those 
sliders and breaking balls.
“When they fall in trouble, they go to the 
breaking ball, and we know that. We just 
had a bad day at the plate.”
While the Gators’ bats were stifled the rest of the night, the Seminoles’ came to life in the fourth.
FSU’s first two batters led off with a 
single and ground-rule double before right fielder James Ramsey tied the game with a two-RBI double off reliever Steven “Paco” Rodriguez.
Rodriguez (1-1) was credited with the loss 
after FSU tacked on another run in the sixth. Then in the eighth, Seminoles left fielder Stu-art Tapley, added a two-out, two-run blast to push the score to the final margin.
“We got to stay positive,” O’Sullivan said. 
“They’re plenty good enough, we’re just go-ing through a tough stretch right now.”

And even when practices are 
open, it’s not like fans are stand-ing in the huddle, asking Char -
lie Weis to call trick plays. Fans are roped off on the side, usu-ally about a football field’s width 
away from the action.
More than anything, this is 
about controlling the message. If 
you can’t see anything, you can’t dispute what they say . Of course, 
none of that will matter come fall. 
If the team succeeds, people will praise them. If the team falters … well, just think back to last sea-son.
If you are salivating for spring 
football updates, the players have luckily been pretty transparent about what exactly is happening 
at Area 51: 
What is this new system going to 
have in it for you?
Wide receiver Andre Debose:  
I really couldn’t tell you what they are going to do with me.
Y ou say you like the new offense. 
Why?
Right guard Jon Halapio: I 
don’t know. I just like it, man. I’m just here to play football. 
They gave me a playbook, and I’m here to learn it.
How does the offense, as a whole, 
look?
Center Jonotthan Harrison: 
The offense as a whole, we’re looking real good. We’re going 
to be amazing.
How comfortable do you think 
John Brantley will be running a pro-style offense?
Wide receiver Frankie Ham-mond Jr.: He looks comfortable. He was comfortable last year. 
Football is football, no matter where you look at it. It’s just an-other style of offense.
Who has stood out to you on the 
offensive side of the ball?
Strong safety Matt Elam: Ev-
eryone’s doing pretty good.
What about the new “Buck posi-
tion” is useful? It sounds cool, but I 
don’t really know why.
Defensive tackle Sharrif 
Floyd: It does sound cool, just saying ‘I’m a Buck.’ But it’s just a 
big part of our defense. 
How excited are you about the 
new defense?
Defensive end William 
Green: I like it a lot more, actual-ly . I’m really excited about what we’re doing.
What in particular do you like 
about the defense? Elam: I like all of it, basically 
— the whole scheme. It’s a good defense.
What is different about the de-
fense?
Outside linebacker Jelani 
Jenkins: We’re going to run and 
hit hard and be relentless and be aggressive. That’s how we’ve al-ways been.
Middle linebacker Jonathan 
Bostic: A lot of stuff is real simi-
lar from last year; not too much of a difference from last year.
Green: I’m not getting into all 
that.
Cornerback Cody Riggs: I 
couldn’t tell you that.
Elam: I can’t talk about that.
Who has made the biggest hit on 
defense?
Elam: I can’t talk about that.See, fans, isn’t this even better 
than watching practice? TYLER , from page 14Bush
