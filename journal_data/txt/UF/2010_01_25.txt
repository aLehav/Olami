SPOTLIGHT ON THE SWAMP
Nursing student holds signing for first book
By ELIZABETH BEHRMAN
Alligator writer
UF junior Laura Francois has a
two-sided story.
She's a nursing major, and she
wrote a book.
Francois released her first novel,
"Reckless Perfection," in Decem-
ber and held her first book signing
Saturday from 1 to 3 p.m. at Books
Inc. on Northwest 13th Street.
"Reckless Perfection" is a 235-
page story of four high school girls
and their relationships and experi-
ences.
Francois said she started writ-
ing the story in a notebook when
she was in eighth grade and let her
friends read it and make comments
in the margins.
She said she rewrote the book
about five times since she started
writing, especially after she en-
countered new high school experi-
ences.
"That really motivated me to
continue to write," Francois said.
She said some parts of the book
are based on her experiences or
those of friends and family, but
most of the story comes straightfrom her imagination.
"I put myself in a situation,
and it's like a movie playing in myhead," she said.
When Francois was finished
with the story about a year ago, shesubmitted it to Legacy Publishing,
an Orlando-based company.
She said when she heard the

Laura Francois, a UF nursing student and author, signs copies of her first book, "Reckless Perfection" at
Books Inc. on Saturday afternoon.news that the company agreed to
publish the book, she was ecstatic
because getting published was al-
ways one of her greatest dreams.
"Just to have that big one ac-
complished is an amazing feeling,"
Francois said.
She said her family and friends
supported and prayed with her ev-
ery step of the way.
"I couldn't do it without God
and my parents," she said. "It defi-
nitely wasn't a solo project."
Sandra Garzon, fellow nursing
student and a friend of Francois'
since high school, said writing is
something Francois is very pas-
sionate about.
"Every time she starts talking
about the book, you can see how
excited she is," Garzon said.
Francois said she will continue
writing after she graduates.
She has already written the se-
quel to "Reckless Perfection" and
started working on the third in-
stallment.
"I think writing is a part of me,"
Francois said. "I can't let that go."
The book is being sold at Books
Inc. and at the UF Bookstore.
Law school gets clinic grant
0 THE COLLEGE WILL PAIR WITH SHANDS
TO OPEN A DOMESTIC ABUSE CLINIC.
By JOEY FLECHAS
Alligator Writer
The UF Levin College of Law received about
$500,000 from the U.S. Department of Justice to fund
a new kind of clinic for victims of domestic vio-
lence.
The Intimate Partner Violence Assistance Clinic,
opening in May, will be located in the obstetrics, gy-
necology and pediatrics clinic at Shands at UF.
Victims will receive medical treatment, meet
with housing and mental health counselors and seek
legal consultation.
Teresa Drake, the clinic's director and a former
assistant state attorney, said the clinic involves a
combined effort from the law school, the UF College
of Medicine, Shands HealthCare and Peaceful Paths
Domestic Abuse Network.
No similar clinic exists on any other campus in
the country, and the collaboration could provide a
model for future clinics, Drake said.

See Story, Page 14."We've got people around the country watching
us," she said.
In order to meet the grant's objectives, curricula
for the college of medicine and the law school will
include domestic violence education and defense
training, Drake said.

She said clinic staff will also reach out to the com-
munity to inform people about the clinic.
Drake said the clinic's obstetrician-gynecologists
will begin training to learn how to screen for domes-
tic abuse in March.
She plans to bring medical and law students to-
gether on community service projects so they can
start working and learning from one another.
"The idea is to train these two critical professions
to recognize and be able to react when they come
across victims of domestic violence," Drake said.

Cyclists promote solar
energy during world tour
The Solar Cyclists are coming
to Gainesville.
The three cyclists, who are
biking around the world to raise
awareness about solar energy
and solutions to climate change,
will be making a pit stop at UF on
Wednesday.
The George A. Smathers Li-
braries is partnering with the UF
Office of Sustainability to hostSolarCycle Week, a week dedi-
cated to promoting solar energy
and cycling.
"Lots of organizations are
joining Smathers Libraries to
organize SolarCycle Week, like
the American Solar Energy So-
ciety at UF, the Reitz Union and
local cycling groups," said Bon-
nie Smith, employee relations
and development coordinator
of George A. Smathers Librar-
ies. "We're trying to get the
whole community involved."
The week's activities will
start today with a U.S. De-
partment of Energy Database
Workshop in the Marston Sci-
ence Library, which will teach
participants to better navigate
and use the Department of En-
ergy databases.
The Reitz Union will show
"The Great Squeeze: Surviving
the Human Project" at 7 p.m.
Tuesday, which investigates
the consequences of human de-
pendence on fossil fuels.
Smith said on there will be
five events Thursday, includ-
ing the SolarCycle Week Expo
on the Plaza of the Americas.
The Solar Cyclists will also
be at the SolarCycle Expo with
their bicycles to answer ques-
tions, according to the event's
Web site.
Smith said she hopes Solar-
Cycle Week will raise aware-
ness about sustainability and
the need for change.
"This is an opportunity for
students to see that things that
are out of the box are attainable,
that they can live dreams and
help the world," Smith said.
"The Solar Cyclists really speak
to the heart."
Cycling and solar power
exhibits will be displayed in
Marston Science Library and
Library West for the rest of the
month.

New SG party named
By ELIZABETH BEHRMAN
Alligator Writer
After surviving a merger, the party
has spoken.
The newly formed Student Alliance
Party, a conglomerate of the former Or-
ange and Blue and Progress parties, has
announced its party leaders for Febru-
ary's Student Government elections.
Former Orange and Blue Party Sen.
Ben Cavataro is the Student Alliance Par-
ty candidate for Student Body president,
and former Progress Party Sen. Dave
Schneider will be the party president.
Cavataro said the party hopes to
bring together students from different
organizations and activities across cam-
pus to make the SG budget more trans-
parent and protect Bright Futures funds.
"All of these segments are going to
come together, and our party is going to
be very broad-based," Cavataro said.
"We're very optimistic," he said. "We
think people are hungry for new leader-ship."
Cavataro said he thinks students
want to move in a new direction.
"We need a Student Government
that's going to stand up, not stand
around," he said.
He cited the Reitz Union fee as an
example and said the party's campaign
will focus on gather-
ing student opinions
about potential fee in-
creases.
Unite Partyspokes-
man Ben Meyers said
the Unite Party's cam-
paign strategies will
Cavataro not be influenced bythe creation of the
new party.
Meyers said the Unite Party has been
successful so far due to the experience of
its members, its ideas and open lines of
communication with the Student Body.
He said the Unite Party will be an-
nouncing its candidates Monday at 3

UF adds to poster collection
By KELLY MORGAN
Alligator Contributing Writer
UF now boasts the largest Mexican film
poster collection of any public institution in
the U.S.
The Efrain Barradas Mexican and Cuban
Film Poster Collection opened to the public
on Jan. 15, and the official dedication was Fri-
day.
Ram6n A. Figueroa, associate professor
of Spanish at Millsaps College in Jackson,
Miss., recently donated his collection of 378
film posters to the Latin American collection
housed in Smathers Library. He asked that
the collection be named after Efrain Barradas,
professor of Spanish-American literature and
Latin American studies at UF.
Figueroa and Barradas met at the Univer-
sity of Massachusetts, where Barradas was
a teacher and Figueroa was studying for his
bachelor's degree.
The posters are from the 1940s and 1950s
and consist of primarily Mexican films, al-
though there are some Cuban film posters, as
well.
James Liversidge, curator of popular cul-
ture collections, described the collection as
eclectic and said he believes it is a perfect fit
for UF."This gives us major focus and puts us on
the map," he said.
Upon learning of the donation, the library
received a $4,500 grant to preserve the post-
ers.
John Freund, chairman of the UF Libraries
Preservation Unit, found preserving this col-
lection to be a daunting task.
"This gives us major focus and
puts us on the map."
James Liversidge
curator of popular cultural collections
He and a student volunteer worked to un-
fold the posters, flatten the edges and smooth
the creases, which took about 90 hours, he
said.
"The biggest problem was the size," Fre-
und said. Each poster is stored in its own pro-
tective casing, which will prevent damage. In
addition to preserving the posters, the library
has digitized versions of the collection.
Hard copies of each poster are numbered,
stored alphabetically and are available in the
library for research purposes.
The collection will be on display in
Smathers Library until Feb. 28.

HAITI RELIEF
Weekend events raise $6,300 for Haiti relief efforts
By MINCH MINCHIN,
TATIANA QUIROGA,
and ANDREA RUMBAUGH
Alligator Contributing Writers
Within three days, three local
events raised about $6,300 for Haiti.
A concert featuring local bands
and free beer at Brophy's Irish Pub
Friday night collected about $1,500.
Most of the money was collected
through the $5 cover charge and
donated to Partners In Health and
Doctors Without Borders, which are
organizations that provide medical
care in countries affected by war, di-
sasters or poverty.
About 250 people attended.
David Sutton, co-organizer of
the event, spent last summer install-
ing clean water filtration systems in
Haiti and decided to organize the
concert a week in advance.
Meredith McCall, a Gainesville
musician, helped plan it.
She found four acoustic perform-
ers and two bands to perform.
Josh Roberts was the first per-
former and began by singing "Save
Me" by Dave Matthews Band.
"I could never think about what
it would be like to have no place
to go, everything around me is de-
stroyed and some of my family
members were missing," Roberts
said. "There's no health care; there is
nothing for the broken legs, the bro-
ken backs, the cuts."
The five other performers were
To All My Dear Friends, Fast Lane,
Monster, Meredith (of Redboy) and
Erica C (of The Wooden).
Gainesville resident Andrea Cel-
lini, 31, came because she wanted tosupport Haiti.
"I feel they've always had a
rough time in Haiti, and this is the
roughest they've faced in a long
time," Cellini said. About 300 other
locals hoping to help Haiti attended
Club Creole's Spring Gala and Proj-ect Haiti fundraiser Saturday night
at the Turkey Creek Golf & Country
Club in Alachua.
Club Creole is a UF Haitian cul-
tural organization, and the event
auctioned off Haitian paintings. It
raised more than $3,000 for ProjectHaiti's medical mission trip to Haiti
in March.
Jemima Douyon, a UF sopho-
more born in Haiti, said almost ev-
ery Haitian person at the fundraiser
knew someone affected by the earth-
quake.
Max Reed / Alligator
Esther Dorvilus, Castille Etienne and Rilwan Ajayi celebrate as their friend places a winning bid of $525
for a Haitian scenery painting at the Club Creole Gala on Saturday."Five people died that I know,"
Douyon said.
The event included a showing of
a video taken near Port-au-Prince
moments after the earthquake. The
audience issued a collective gasp as
a scene depicted a motionless, dust-
encrusted hand protruding from
rubble.
Aaron Jackson, the keynote
speaker of the gala and co-founder
of Planting Peace, a nonprofit orga-
nization that promotes health and
safety around the world, spoke at
the event.
He has spent about a week in
Haiti helping with relief efforts and
also encouraged gala attendees to
do their part.
About 400 students attended a
$5 pancake brunch Friday to benefit
Gators United for Haiti.
The event raised about $1,800
and was hosted by Kappa Alpha
Theta and Sigma Phi Epsilon, said
Rachel Bevans, Kappa Alpha Theta
president.
Bevans said the event also re-
ceived support from people who
are not involved in Greek organiza-
tions.
"It's more about making a dif-
ference than having a social hour,"
Bevans said.
Sigma Phi Epsilon president and
finance junior Mike Eisen said the
event was a good way to raise mon-
ey while opening it up to as many
people as possible.
"So many people were killed, in-
jured and left homeless," Eisen said.
"With the resources we had here, we
figured we could make something
of a difference."

Import cars face off
By GLENN COINE
Alligator Contributing Writer
The smell of alcohol, burnt rub-
ber and gasoline filled the air Sun-
day at Gainesville Raceway as about
200 competitors and 1,500 spectators
showed up for the 101st Import Face-
Off.
The event comes to Gainesville
twice a year and hosts more than 20
events annually nationwide. And ac-
cording to director Cliff Wallace, it is
the only event of its kind to survive
the recession.
"Every other event has gone
bust," he said. "But if they keep com-
ing, we'll keep doing it."
Dwight Baldwin, co-owner of
Stage 6 Motorsports in Jacksonville,
blames dependency on foreign oil
for the drop in attendance and prize
money.
Baldwin said E85, which is 85 per-
cent ethanol and 15 percent race gas,
is a viable option to cut the cost of ex-
pensive fuel.
"You can make really good power
on it. The problem is it's hard to come
by," he said.
' b 'However, he thinks it will become
more readily available in the near fu-
ture.
But for now, cars are an expen-
sive hobby. People like Vic Miraflor,
42, of Orange Park, spend thousands
of dollars rebuilding and modifying
cars for speed.
"Every other event has gone
bust," he said. "But if they
keep coming, we'll keep do-
ing it."
Cliff Wallace
event director
His '95 Honda Civic ran a 10.23
second 1/4 mile at 144 miles per
hour on Sunday. To put that in per-
spective, Motortrend.com lists the
1/4 mile time for a Ferrari 599 as 11.3
seconds at 126.4 miles per hour.
Despite the cost, Miraflor said he
loves what he does.
"When I'm stressed, I just go to
the garage and start working on my
car," he said. "I focus on one thing,
and everything else just goes away."

Sour SexToon
Haiti cartoon wasn't
meant to offend
Picture is worth a thousand words.
But 1,000 words is nothing compared to what the
editorial Board received when the Alligator ran Thurs-
day's sexToon, which depicted two people having sex on a table
texting the word "Haiti" to the Red Cross.
Before we talk about anything else in this editorial, we would
like to say one thing: We still have a lot to figure out.
After all, we are students.
However, we have a much bigger responsibility than most
of the Student Body.
Don't get us wrong -it's an awesome one. We get to bring
UF students and Gainesville residents their daily dose of local
news, politics, entertainment and Gators sports.
When deciding to run that cartoon, we in no way wanted to
make light of the situation that happened in Haiti.
Furthermore, we appreciate all of the fundraising efforts that
have come from the Red Cross, UF organizations, the Salvation
Army and any other person or group who has stepped up in
this time of need.
We were simply trying to show how people have come to-
gether to help the Haitians in their time of need, as we do when
we publish stories about the relief efforts of students -only
with the cartoon, we were giving it a humorous spin. We un-
derstand that Haitians are dealing with a horrible tragedy, and
we would never want to treat the situation insensitively. But
despite the heartbreak, we see beauty in the way the world is
coming together to help Haitians. Our cartoon was simply an
acknowledgment of the fact that people are joining together to
get behind a cause.
Alligator employees are standing behind Haitians as much
as anyone else. The Avenue Editor wrote a guest column last
week encouraging students to donate, and most of us have
made personal donations.
We apologize if the execution fell a little flat, but the cartoon
was certainly not malicious, and offense was never our inten-
lion.
We are an independent newspaper, and we rely on each
other and ourselves to make good decisions and good choices.
However, we do not operate under the illusion that we are
perfect. We want feedback, and we want to learn. We don't look
at the past with regret but as an opportunity to grow.
That's why we created a special e-mail address where you
can send your questions, comments and concerns: alligator-
feedback@gmail.com
This is not the place to harangue us. What you send here
will not be published in the Letters to the Editor section. This is
a place where you can send constructive criticism, suggestions,
ideas, etc. and be assured that the editors will read it. We want
to be as connected as possible to the Student Body, and the only
way we can do that is to have an open pathway for you to ac-
cess us.
Lay it on us.
That said, we would like to make it clear that we won't be
bullied into removing the sexToons completely.
And talking to our advertisers about our "smut magazine,"
or e-mailing President Machen (yeah, someone really hates us
that much) won't scare us.
We may be independent from UF and distribute our paper
to more people than just college students, but when it comes
down to it, we are a college newspaper.
And college students have sex -not all of them, but a lot of
them. You may not agree with it, and you may not participate,
but it happens.
So if we want to publish a sexToon in the entertainment sec-
tion, we will.

Obamia needs to fight back after loss
ell, it's official -the presidency of BarackObama is over.
No, seriously, it's over. After all, the pun-
dits have spoken. Scott Brown, a Republican state sena-
tor from Massachusetts, which is probably the most lib-
eral, commie pinko place on earth, was elected to the
U.S. Senate last week in a special election to fill the late
Ted Kennedy's spot.
See, the people have spoken. Or, more precisely,
1,168,107 voters in Massachusetts have spoken. And
what did they say? We want change!
Surprising, isn't it?
And because the Obama presidency is over, the pun-
dits have taken to writing up its obituary. Here lies the
Obama administration, killed by a disconnection with
the American people over the role of government, says
Wall Street Journal columnist Peggy Noonan. Here is
the grave of the Democratic Party, killed off by its own
hubris, New York Times columnist David Brooks con-
tends.
Both Noonan and Brooks make the same flawed
observation that's been circulating around the op-ed
pages, radio talk shows and cable-television shouting
matches all week: Obama believed his own hype and
never adapted to the public's changing mood on issues
like finance and health care reform.
The problem with this analysis is that it pretends the
public was never invested in meaningful reform. Just
one year ago, the vast majority of America was gung-
ho on completely overhauling our broken health care
system.
Even six months ago, a majority of Americans thought
health care reform should include a public option.
In the past six months, Obama and the American
people have suffered a leadership crisis.
People don't get ticked off when an elected official
doesn't listen to their concerns. No, people get indig-nant when a leader doesn't try
to convince the public why he's
right. When the opposition came
out and painted health care reform
as a radical, un-American piece
of legislation aimed at destroy-
Matthew Christ ing the American family and whoMttew Chli ors knows what else, D.C. Democrats
_etters_____ator or never came out with equal fervor
to recapture the public's attention.
They lost faith in their own convictions.
Even worse, all of this played out over the back-
ground of a less-than-stellar economy. A new Brookings
Institute report finds that in 2008, more than 30 percent
of the population fell below the poverty line. With fig-
ures like that, you simply can't afford to appear preoc-
cupied with what now appears to be a political fight.
Not all's bad. President Obama is still the most trust-
ed person in government, Democrats are consistently
ranked higher than Republicans in opinion polls, and
the GOP, despite its recent win in Massachusetts, is still
the party of no ideas.
The president has another chance to convince the
American public why his ideas are right for the country
this Wednesday at his State of the Union address.
Otherwise, he'll continue to come off like Count Ros-
tov in Leo Tolstoy's "War and Peace." After giving a
rousing speech, Rostov marches into battle only to see
the enemy actually advancing toward him. Rostov,
aloof and perplexed, wonders why the enemy keeps
marching. "To kill me?" he asks, "Me, whom everyone
loves so?"
There is something to say about the audacity of fight-
ing back.
Matthew Christ is a political science and journalism
sophomore.

Lowe: The campaidn will be organized, active and respectful of Gainesville
OPENING, from page 1
will be voices who want to return
to the policies of old," he told the
crowd. "That will not be a part of
the Gainesville we want."
Since Lowe announced his
candidacy in August, the cam-
paign has mobilized about 100
volunteers, said Garrett Garner,
Lowe's campaign manager.
Garner expects more to join
as the March 16 election drawscloser.
Julia Boyd, a UF political sci-
ence and economics junior who
serves as an intern on the cam-
paign, said one of Lowe's best
characteristics is his ability to
connect with people, especially
students.
"He's not locked behind a
closed door," she said. "He's out
there with the people. He cares
about the community."
In an interview before thegrand opening, Lowe empha-
sized the importance of the up-
L Lwicoming election.
"The future
of Gainesville is
in the balance
in this election,"
he said. "We
need to continue
the progress we
have made in
order to make Gainesville a bet-
ter place."Lowe is running against four
opponents: Monica Cooper, Don
Marsh and Richard Selwach.
While Lowe maintains that he
is confident in his campaign, he
said he will not be complacent.
"We'll run a very organized
and active campaign that's re-
spectful of Gainesville," he said.
Jeff Lane, who attended the
opening, offered Lowe the en-
dorsement of the Gainesville Pro-
fessional Firefighters, praising hiscommitment to law enforcement.
Lane, who said Gainesville
is facing its most difficult times
since the 1970s, believes Lowe
has all the right attributes to lead
the city.
"Challenging times require
experience in city government,"
Lane said.
"[Lowe] has the ability to bring
many divergent points of view to
a consensus. I think he's the best
candidate," he said.

Parsons beats buzzer to sink Gamecocks I UFrugby
Harrison Diamond / Alligator Staff
UF forward Chandler Parsons shoots the game-winning three-pointer as time expires in the
Gators' 58-56 win against South Carolina in the O'Connell Center on Saturday night.By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
a berry@alligator org
Chandler Parsons can't help but feel a little
lucky.
Less than three weeks after hitting a 75-foot
game-winner at N.C. State, the junior forward
nailed a three-pointer from the left wing as time
expired to give Florida a 58-56 win against South
Carolina on Saturday night in the O'Connell
Center.
"I'm the most blessed player in this country, I
swear to God," Parsons said. "I just keep asking
myself, 'How does that happen to me?' Honestly,
I was just in the right place at the right time."
After the 21-footer found nothing but net,
Parsons ran down the court
before being mobbed by his
teammates, eventually finding
himself buried at the bottom ofMen's a dogpile for the second time
Basketball this month.
The Gators (14-5, 3-2 South-
eastern Conference) needed
Parsons' buzzer-beater to hold off the Game-
cocks (11-8, 2-3 SEC), who took a 56-55 lead with
five seconds left on a layup by guard Devan
Downey.
Downey, who led all scorers with 36 despite
facing double teams throughout the night, raced
the length of the court, blew by UF's entire team
and dropped in a tough layup off the glass.
UF coach Billy Donovan said he worked in
practice on late-game situations, like the one the
Gators faced after Downey's layup, setting up
his team to run the length of the floor and get a
shot up with 10 seconds remaining.
It didn't work as well in practice as it did
against the Gamecocks.

George's block helps hold off South Carolina
By EUGENIO TORRENS
Alligator Writer
etorrens@alligator org
It wasn't the 40-point win
Jordan Jones might have liked
against her former team, but she'll
live with the outcome.
UF guard Trumae Lucas
drained the go-ahead pull-up
jumper with 17.7 seconds left to
give the Gators (11-9, 4-3 South-
eastern Conference) a 59-56 win
over South Carolina on Sunday.
It was Florida's ninth game
this season decided by single dig-
its (4-5)."It was tough seeing familiar
faces," said Jones, who trans-
ferred to UF after her freshman
year at USC. "It's just a good feel-
ing, kind of justifying why I came
here."
Forward Jennifer George
finished with a career-high six
blocks, including one on USC
guard La'Keisha Sutton with nine
seconds left. Gamecocks center
Kelsey Bone grabbed the ball
in time for one last shot, but it
clanged off the rim and UF for-
ward Sharielle Smith corralled
the rebound.UF outblocked USC 9-0.
"I just try to use my strength,"
George said. "Just trying to push
by the paint and use every bit of
myself to get up
on them."
The Game-
cocks (10-9, 3-4
SEC) fell behind
Georgeby 13 after Lucas
sank two free
throws with 9:28
left in the first
half. Jones added a three-pointer
69 seconds later before USC went
on a 15-4 run to close out thehalf.
Bone, the SEC's top rebounder,
had a game-high 11 boards and
almost matched her season aver-
age (14.5) with 14 points in the
first half on 5-of-9 shooting, in-
cluding a 4-of-5 effort at the free-
throw line.
Foul trouble in the second
half kept her scoreless for 18-
plus minutes, but she made an
immediate impact once Florida's
Azania Stewart fouled out. Bone
finished with 19 points, and Sut-
ton (15) and Valerie Nainima (12)

the UF A-team's hard-fought
18-16 win, the "Killer B's"

I'm still hazy on the rules
and tactics of the game, but one
look at the dedication from the
players involved is enough to
make me give rugby a chance.

Gators send off seniors with
Men top Auburn for first time since 1999
By MATT RUBIN
Alligator Writer
The men's and women's swim-
ming and diving teams celebrated
the careers of 15 athletes Friday
against Auburn on Senior Day.
And they did it with wins.
In the final meet of the season
at the O'Connell Center Nata-
torium, the men's and women's
squads beat the Tigers by scores of
162-138 and 185-115, respectively.
The Gators' men's squad (8-0, 3-0
Southeastern Conference) stayed
undefeated with the victory while
the women improved their record
to 9-2, and 3-1 in the SEC.
"It was a real exciting meet
for the seniors and the whole
team," UF coach Gregg Troy said.
"We've got a close group, so when
the seniors get excited with their
parents here it rubs off on the rest
of the team."
Using that excitement, the
Gators swam a total of 40 NCAA
provisional-qualifying times. The
men's team ended the day win-
ning nine of 16 events, while the
women won 10 of 16.
With the help of the seniors,
the men's team topped defend-ing national champion Auburn
for the first time since the 1998-99
season. Senior Shaune Fraser led
the way, winning the 100-yard
(47.00) and 200-yard butterfly(1:44.37) and placing second in
the 100-yard freestyle (43.82), all
NCAA provisional-qualifying
times.

In fact, Spofforth's 100-yard

Dickerson picks up another all-around title in UF win
ETHE FRESHMAN HAS WON THE
ALL-AROUND TITLE IN EVERY MEET.
By TOM GREEN
Alligator Writer
The Gators went into Memorial Coliseum
wanting to prove they could excel away from
the friendly confines of the O'Connell Cen-
ter.
Friday night against No. 12 Kentucky,
Florida did just that, as it won their dual
meet, 196.050-195.350. The win gave No. 4
Florida (2-1, 2-0 Southeastern Conference) its
first road victory.Freshman Ashan6e Dickerson continued
her early-season surge and walked away
with another all-around title Friday. Her total
score of 39.25 made Dickerson three-for-three
in all-around performances this season.
"She's a robot," UF coach Rhonda Faehn
said. "I think her beam was better than her
score reflected and her floor routine was the
best one she's done so far this year. She just
keeps showing improvement and she's only
going to get better."
After an uncharacteristic 8.75 on the bars
by senior Amanda Castillo, the team was able
to rebound nicely, and it finished the event
with a 49.05 and a .400-point advantage afterone rotation.
It was a lead the Gators would not relin-
quish.
Following the first ro-
tation, the Gators scored
well on the vault (49.175)
and on their floor exercises
(49.075) before closing the
meet out on the balance
beam.
Last week, Florida had
Dickerson issues in the middle of its
lineups.
Going into the final rotation of Friday's
meet, the Gators made sure there were nocostly errors this time around.
On the beam, senior Courtney Gladys
bounced back from a shaky routine against
Arkansas and scored a 9.825, which tied with
freshman Liz Green and Kentucky's Storey
Morris for first place in the event.
The team's 48.750 on the beam, despite
being its lowest team score of the meet, was
still good enough for the Gators to hold off
the Wildcats and come away with the team's
second-straight victory.
"It was a complete 180 from the first road
meet," Gladys said. "We're definitely head-
ing in the right direction for the rest of the
season."

of the clock," Donovan said. "That's the
worst thing you can do in that situation.
You have to drive the ball to the bas-
ket."
Walker put Donovan's advice into
effect Saturday night. Despite being
the team's hottest shooter in conference
play, Walker took the quick inbounds
pass from Dan Werner, sped down to the
free-throw line, drew the defense and
dished it off to a wide-open Parsons.
"That was an unbelievable shot but
an even better pass," Parsons said.
Parsons missed his first three shots
from beyond the arc on the night, but he
said the last one felt good as soon as he
let it go -unlike his other last-second"I'm not gonna say the N.C. State
one felt good off my hands, but this one
did," Parsons said. "This one definitely
felt good. No matter how many I miss,
I'm gonna keep shooting."
"That was an unbelievable shot
but an even better pass."
Chandler Parsons
UF junior forward
Starting for the third-consecutive
game in place of Werner, Parsons fin-
ished with 10 points and 10 rebounds for
the fourth double-double of his career
while playing a team-high 36 minutes.
Three other Gators finished in dou-ble figures, led by Kenny Boynton's 14
points.
Boynton shot just 5 of 13 from the
field and 0 of 5 from beyond the arc, but
he went 4 for 4 from the free-throw line,
including three clutch shots late.
Down 54-52 with 11 seconds to go,
Boynton drew a shooting foul on Game-
cocks guard Ramon Galloway. The
freshman went to the line and drained
all three free throws, giving the Gators a
one-point lead.
"One thing that's going to be lost
in this game is the fact that a freshman
walked up to the free-throw line and
made three free throws with 11 seconds
to go downby two," Donovan said. "That
says a lot about him as a player, his focus
and what kind of player he is."

WHOOPS, from page 14
also scored in double-figures for the Gamecocks, who
were second in the SEC in three-point shooting at 47

"Kelsey is so talented," UF coach Amanda Butler
said. "She's the total package because she's big, she's
strong, and she is so skilled. The more we could get
her off the floor, certainly that improved our chanc-
es.",
With Stewart limited on the offensive end by
fouls, other Gators stepped up in the second half.
Lucas scored nine second-half points, and Lonnika
Thompson hit back-to-back three-pointers to sustain
a four-minute 9-4 UF run while Bone was benched
due to foul trouble. Smith and Lucas led the Gators
with 11 points each.
Florida cleaned up its play with four turnovers in
the second half compared to 12 in the first half.
At the men's basketball team's matchup with
South Carolina on Saturday, Butler encouraged fans
to come out for her team's game as well, and she
thanked the O'Connell Center crowd of 2,053 after
the game.

"The college level is really the base
level for growth in rugby (in the US) at
the moment because that's where it's
developed," UF A-side captain Neal Du-
pree said. "I think you're really seeing the
beginning of something new that's going
to be sticking with the American sports
culture."
The camaraderie element is also inter-
esting. After Friday night's matches, the
two teams hit the pub together.
"In the game, you were hitting some-
one in the face and now you're sitting
down having a drink with them," Dupree
said. "It's a powerful chemistry that the
sport maintains. The level of respect for
going out on the field is something I think
you don't see in most American sports."
The game is entertaining, even for
those who don't grasp its intricacies.
At its worst, rugby is unsuccessful
runs up the middle and punts. At its best,
it's like watching a never-ending option
offense, and there are parallels to some of
the most exciting plays in football.
Field position is crucial, so punts are
pretty frequent. But there's no fair catch
in this sport, so every kick that stays in
bounds leads to contact.
Also, forget roughing the kicker. Dur-
ing the B-match, a 'Nole trying to get off
a punt was clotheslined by a charging
Gator, leading to a loose ball and UF try.
On offense, the goal is to pound the
ball up the middle, draw defenders in
and start an option offense toward the
outside. With a long line of players ready
for the next pitch, it looks like the Stan-
ford-Cal desperation kickoff return.
Plus, there's still the whole violence
angle if that's what you're looking for.
With men's and women's clubs at UF,
there's ample opportunity to learn a sport
that has worldwide appeal.
And while I'm not crazy enough to
play, when the Gators line up against
Florida Atlantic on Saturday, I plan on
being glued to the sidelines.
