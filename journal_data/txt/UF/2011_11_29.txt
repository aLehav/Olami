  A UF student died in a car crash Sunday while return-
ing from the Thanksgiving break.
  Jade Guzzo, 20, was killed when the car she was driv-
ing ﬂ  ipped several times, according to a Florida Highway 
Patrol police report.
  Guzzo was driving northbound through Osceola Coun-
ty on Florida’s Turnpike when her Isuzu Rodeo drifted off 
the road. The vehicle ﬂ  ipped when Guzzo over-corrected to get back on the road, according to the report.
  She was pronounced dead at the scene of the accident.
  Twenty-year-old Leah Thomas was riding with her at 
the time. Thomas was taken to a hospital in Orlando to be 
treated for serious injuries.
  Guzzo was an architecture major from Delray Beach.
  Alcohol was not a factor in the crash, according to the 
Florida Highway Patrol.
  The crash was still under investigation as of Monday.  Student dies in

  When the coffee is ﬂ  owing freely and 
tables at Library West are littered with 
study guides and review packets, Rachel Swansiger has a few strategies to beat the crowds.
  “You can study anywhere quiet on cam-
pus besides the library,” said Swansiger, a 21-year-old history and German senior. She recommends Pugh Hall for its comfortable chairs, and its smaller libraries offer fewer distractions.
  However, Library West and Marston 
Science Library are the only libraries at UF that will be open longer during ﬁ  nals. From Sunday to Dec. 15, Library West will be open from 8 a.m. to 4 a.m. every day. 
The libraries kept the same hours for 
Spring 2011 ﬁ  nals.
  UF libraries Public Information Ofﬁ  cer 
Barbara Hood said the ﬁ  rst-ﬂ  oor Starbucks cafe will stay open the same hours as Li-brary West. 
  Graduate students will still need ID 
cards to access the sixth ﬂ  oor of Library West. Any student can use all ﬂ  oors of Marston and the ﬁ  rst through fourth ﬂ  oors of Library West, Hood said. The ﬁ  fth ﬂ  oor is accessible to staff only.
  The numbers of expected students and 
last year’s library-goers were not available by press time.
  Journalism junior Jesse Mixson, 20, said 
she doesn’t usually deal with crowds at Li-brary West and Marston. She said the ﬁ  rst ﬂ  oor of Library West is usually available.

   Alachua County may follow Gaines-
ville’s example and repeal restrictions on liquor sales hours.
  After Gainesville decided to make 
alcohol laws the same for every day of the week, the Alachua County Com-mission is looking to do the same.
  On Nov. 15, County Commissioner 
Lee Pinkoson proposed that business-es in the unincorporated parts of the county should be given the same rights as Gainesville businesses.
  His motion passed unanimously 
Nov. 17, but county commissioners said they would not repeal their limitations of liquor sales, or “blue laws,” until af-ter the City Commission vote is ﬁ  nal.
  The repeal will be discussed in 
the near future, said Alachua County 
Commissioner Susan Baird.
  She said as long as 
the repeal doesn’t vi-olate personal rights, it should follow the suit of the city.
  “Any hour is bad 
if you abuse it, and 
any hour is OK if you don’t abuse it,” Baird said.
  “I don’t know why they are repeal- County may repeal blue laws 
after ﬁ  nal Gainesville vote

� THEY WILL ACCEPT ONLY CASH WHILE 
THE WORK IS BEING DONE.
ERIN JESTER

Visitors are encouraged to bring cash to pay the 
meters while the parking pay stations inside the Re-
itz Union parking garage are being replaced.
During the upgrade, which begins Thursday 
and is expected to take three to four weeks, the four 
multispace meters inside the garage will not accept 
credit cards, said Scott Fox, director of Transporta-tion and Parking Services. 
Customers paying for parking with credit cards 
will have to pay at the attendant’s booth.
The parking pay stations in the Reitz Union ga-
rage are 8 years old and were installed when the Welcome Center was built, he said.
That particular type of machine will not be sup-
ported by the vendor, Parkeon, after July 1. The pay stations are being replaced as a preven-
tative measure, Fox said.
“If we didn’t do this, and we waited until July 
1 and we had a problem, then [Parkeon] wouldn’t come out and fix it,” he said.
UF will buy the new pay stations from Parkeon.No other garages on campus will be affected be-
cause the Reitz Union garage is the only one that uses the type of machine being replaced. 
Fox said the replacement schedule is tentative, 
but Transportation and Parking Services is trying to finish the upgrade before the start of spring semes-ter classes.
“We’re working on getting it done as quickly as 
possible,” he said.
Advertising junior Aubrey Read, 20, said she 
parks her car in the Reitz Union garage a few times a month, usually when she’s in a hurry.
Paying at the attendant’s booth when she forgets 
to bring cash probably won’t help that, she said.
“It’s annoying,” she said. “I’ll probably be late 
for class.”Reitz garage meters to get an upgrade

A Florida State University fan was arrested 
Saturday after police said he stomped a UF 
fan’s head into a curb Saturday before the foot-ball game.
At 5:25 p.m. Saturday , Joshua Halford, a 
21-year-old UF fan from Gainesville, argued with Robert Keller, a 27-year-old FSU fan from Orlando, over who would win the game. 
During the argument, Halford said he had 
Allah on his side to help the Gators win, said Cpl. Angelina Valuri, public information offi-cer for the Gainesville Police Department. . 
“I’ll show you Allah,” Keller said before he 
shoved Halford into traffic at 1300 W Univer -
sity Ave. and punched him in the face. Valuri said a fellow FSU fan and friend of 
Keller’s, Wesley Ponder, 33, of Jacksonville, forced his way into the fight and stomped the victim’s head against the curb, knocking him out, she said. 
Halford was taken to Shands at UF, where 
he was treated for a concussion. 
Ponder fled the scene, leaving behind sev-
eral witnesses, Valuri said. Ponder and Keller were later arrested and 
they were taken to the Alachua County Jail. 
Keller was charged with battery and aggra-
vated assault, while Ponder was charged with aggravated battery , Valuri said. 
Both men did not have set bonds but were 
released from jail Sunday, according to the Alachua County Sheriff’s Office Department of the Jail. FSU fan arrested for stomping UF fan’s head into curb before gameReynolds

Creating jobs was top on many candidates’ minds at a 
city candidate forum Monday night as they encouraged 
UF students to stay in Gainesville.
Democratic supporters filled the Matthews Suite in 
the Reitz Union to listen to six candidates running for Gainesville City Commission.
About 50 people — half of which were students — 
crowded into the room, which is about the size of a 40-student classroom.
 Last year’s City Commission forum in the Reitz Union 
Grand Ballroom attracted about 35 people — most of whom were not students.
The forum focused on student issues ranging from 
public transportation to student involvement in the city.
While city races are nonpartisan, the UF College Dem-
ocrats and the Alachua County Young Democrats invited candidates who identify with the party to talk to students, 
commissioners and members of the organizations.
The candidates present from the At-Large 1 race were 
James Ingle, Dejeon Cain and Lauren Poe. The candidates 
present from the District 1 race were Yvonne Hinson-Rawls, Ray Washington and Armando Grundy.
“We want to get students that graduate here to stay 
here,” Grundy said.
Several candidates reflected his sentiment.“This race is about jobs,” Ingle said.
Candidates’ responses varied when asked if initiatives 
such as Innovation Hub will create jobs.
Innovation Hub is a 48,000-square-foot business incu-
bator designed to house startup companies grown out of technology developed at UF and around the state. 
“This could be the Silicon valley of the South,” Hinson-
Rawls said.
Others disagreed.Washington said Innovation Hub is “nonsense” and 
that it isn’t needed for innovation.Responses varied when asked about how to improve 
public transportation in the city, but most of the candi-dates agreed that transportation could be improved.
Poe recommended looking into a streetcar system.
Hinson-Rawls said it would be a good idea to desig-
nate one lane of traffic for carpools and buses.Ingle said there needs to be more RTS bus service at 
Santa Fe College.
Cain said it would help to have 24-hour RTS bus ser -
vice.

More high school dropouts in Alachua 
County may choose not to go back to school 
because they now have to pay tuition.
Charley Wise, supervisor of adult edu-
cation for Alachua County Public Schools, 
said he has seen a decrease in enrollment in 
adult education classes this fall, something he attributes to a new tuition policy.
In an effort to offset budget cuts, the 
Florida Legislature passed a law last spring requiring state residents to pay $30 for 18 weeks of classes, including those for GED preparation and English as a second lan-guage. Nonresidents must pay $120.
This fall, Wise said Alachua County has 
about 100 students enrolled in GED prepa-ration classes and about 80 to 100 students in English Speakers of Other Languages classes. Although last year’s numbers were unavailable, Wise called the drop “signifi-cant.”
Enrollment in GED preparation classes 
has fallen 70 percent in Broward County 
and 61 percent in Palm Beach County, ac-
cording to numbers in the South Florida Sun-Sentinel. 
Wise said Alachua County may stop of-fering classes during the summer because there’s a chance not enough people will sign up for a seven-week course that costs the same as an 18-week course.
But Wise said he thinks the intentions 
behind the regulation were good.
“I think the Legislature was trying to 
get a little more commitment from people,” he said. “If you have to pay up front, you 
might be more inclined to finish the pro-
gram and be a success.”
Though GED and ESOL classes have 
lower numbers, Wise said they may be more successful students, but the school district won’t see results for a year or two.
Coming up with the money may not 
be the only problem. To prove residency, students must present two forms of identi-
fication such as a driver’s license, a voter’s 
registration card, a utility bill or two years of high school transcripts.
If a student is unable to produce two 
forms, he or she is classified as a nonresi-dent.
The population that may have been hit 
the hardest, Wise said, is Alachua County’s inmates.
Last year, 62 students graduated from 
the jail’s free GED program. This year, there are only 20 to 30 students enrolled, he said.
“I really think it’s in society’s best in-
terest to make sure a fellow has a degree when he walks out of jail,” Wise said.Number of those seeking GEDs

The new online registration system 
for group fitness classes has had what 
RecSports Coordinator for Fitness Am-bre Sheehy calls a “learning curve.”
Students like 18-year-old advertis-
ing freshman Amanda George have had problems registering for classes online. 
“One time, I forgot to hit the ‘check-
out’ button, so my name didn’t get add-ed to the list,” she said. “I had to wait in the standby line.”
Sheehy said about 20 percent of stu-
dents registering for classes had this problem during the first two weeks 
after the Oct. 24 implementation of the 
system. 
Now, she said, less than 5 percent of 
students have these problems. 
Sheehy attributes the problems with 
registration to the process itself.
Some students think they have com-
pleted the process when they click the “save registration” button, but the pro-cess isn’t complete until the “checkout” button is clicked.
“[The registration process] is confus-
ing at first, but now I understand it,” George said.
A registration guide is available for 
students at recsports.ufl.edu.
Public relations junior Hannah 
Leach, 20, said that despite having made the mistake of not clicking the “checkout” button, she thinks the on-
line registration guide has been clear in 
its instructions. 
“If you follow the directions, it’s 
pretty straight-forward,” Leach said. “I like the program. I can just show up for the class without having to wait in line.”
She also said the system can motivate 
students to attend the fitness classes.
Students who fail to show up for a 
fitness class without canceling their registration are given a warning for the first and second offenses. 
Participants are blocked from regis-
tering for group fitness classes for five days during their third and all subse-quent offenses. 
Sheehy said about seven stu-
dents have been blocked from at-tending fitness classes thus far.  
Despite problems with the registration process, Sheehy said that in the first staff meeting after the implementation of the system, fitness instructors have mentioned they’ve had an increase in class attendance. 
“A lot more people than I had antici-
pated are using the system,” she said.RecSports works out kinks in

Does voting really matter? Should the draft 
be reinstated? Should Sarah Palin run for presi-
dent?
These are some of the questions that the Bob 
Graham Center Public Service Council will en-
courage students to answer through the Great 
Civil Debate Wall.
Launching Jan. 17, the wall will allow UF stu-
dents and Gainesville residents to debate current politicized and controversial issues.
Eleven members of the council met Monday 
evening to compile a bank of questions, which will be displayed on five touch-screen kiosks on a wall of the Pugh Hall Ocora Room.
The wall is comprised of electronic interfaces 
that display questions in topics from internation-al relations to policies implemented at UF.Visitors are asked a yes-or-no question and 
are then prompted to supplement their answers with an explanation consisting of 140 characters or less. Users can then comment on other visi-
tors’ responses.
The wall has cost about $250,000 of a $3 mil-
lion Knight Foundation grant, said Ann Hender -
son, director of the Graham Center. 
“Our big goal is to have [2,500] students using 
it,” said 21-year-old Sabin Ciocan, a UF history 
and political science senior and president of the Graham Center Public Service Council.
“We’re trying to study whether social media 
can be used to improve our civic dialogue in the United States,” Henderson said.
Eight percent of Floridians under the age of 
30 voted in the 2010 election, said Shelby Taylor, digital/communications director of the Graham Center. 
“We, as a public university, and the Bob Gra-
ham Center, as a public service center, have an obligation to try to turn those numbers around,” 
she said.

The Gator Student Alliance for -
mally announced its formation and 
its week of action at noon Monday on Turlington Plaza.
The week of action campaign is 
fighting against the recent 15 per -
cent tuition hike for the 2011-12 academic year.
From 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. today on 
the North Lawn students can voice their opinions by signing the Gator Student Alliance banner.
Students can learn about tuition 
hikes at noon Wednesday on the 
Plaza of the Americas. The week of 
action ends on Thursday with a ral-
ly at 1:30 p.m. on Turlington Plaza. The alliance will march from Turl-ington to Emerson Hall to present 
demands to the Board of Trustees. 
Of the 22 groups in the alli-
ance, delegates from Students for a Democratic Society, Club Creole, 
CHISPAS, UF College Democrats, Colombian Student Association and Graduate Assistants United an-
nounced their association Monday. 
The Hispanic Student Association 
delegate was also present but did not speak. 
“We’re so excited to be part of 
the driving force on campus,” said 
Erin Murphy, 21, the UF College 
Democrats delegate and an envi-ronmental science senior. 
The Creole Club delegate, Mer -
ancia Noelsaint, a 21-year-old tele-
communication junior, said she be-
lieves tuition hikes affect minorities the most. Her club consists mostly of Haitians who are expected to get 
an education but rely heavily on 
scholarships and grants to achieve 
that, she said after the conference. She will march in the rally on Thursday.
UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes 
said two students requested to speak at the Board of Trustees meeting. 
“We are certainly willing to see 
what they have to say on Thurs-day,” Sikes said.Student groups come together to protest tuition hikes this week

UF has received a $1.1 million grant to 
research and help improve behavioral health 
care in three Indian cities. 
The National Institutes of Health’s Foga-
rty International Center awarded the money to UF.
Although India has one of the highest sui-
cide rates in the world, it is severely lacking in mental health professionals, said Linda B. Cottler, leader of the project.
Other mental health issues that will be 
addressed are violence, addiction, psychosis and dementia, she said in a UF news release.“We need more mental health profession-
als trained in India,” she said. 
Cottler, a UF professor and chairwoman of 
the epidemiology department in the colleges of Public Health and Health Professions and Medicine, said the project will focus on three cities: Bengaluru, Gangtok and Tezpur.
The project will concentrate on increasing 
the number of mental health professionals through workshops in India and fellowships for Indian professionals in the U.S., Cottler said. 
These fellowships have health profession-
als from India come to the U.S. for an extend-ed period of time. 
Cottler said the idea is for the Indian trainees who study in the U.S. to take their knowledge back to India and teach others.  
Sonam Ongmu Lasopa, a trainee from India, said she is gaining a lot of experience in her 
time in the U.S. 
She said she worked in 
Sikkim for five years as a psychologist before com-ing to study in the United 
States in January. 
Lasopa can attest to the 
fact that there are very few 
mental health profession-
als in these regions, she said.
“There’s a lot of stigma attached to being 
mentally ill,” she said.People from India tend to seek religious 
help before professional help, she said, and some people attribute their behavior to pos-session by demons.
“That’s the more acceptable form of 
treatment for people who behave ab-normally,” she said. “By the time the person comes to the mental health fa-cility, the prognosis is already bad.”  
Many people from India are not aware that they have a mental illness, Lasopa said.  
She hopes that by promoting awareness 
through her research while at UF, she can spread her knowledge and help those suffer -
ing from mental illnesses.

Questions chosen for debate wallThere are mixed reactions 
to lifting the restrictions
ing it at all,” said Nick Tatel, 35, 
manager of Express Lane Liquor in Alachua.
He said he normally gets very 
little business on Sundays anyway.
“I think it’s good you can’t sell 
liquor on Sundays,” Tatel said. “It gives people time to go to church and not be hungover on Monday.”
Most people buy alcohol on Fri-
day nights and Saturdays, he said.
“People go to church on Sun-
day,” Tatel said. “[People] want to be with their families on Sundays.”
The Alachua County laws cur -
rently allow beer and wine sales on Sundays from 1 p.m. to 11 p.m. On Sundays, no liquor may be sold.
“What’s the difference between 
beer and liquor? It’s all alcohol,” said Alan Fishman, 60, manager and owner of Spindrifter Lounge in Alachua.
Fishman has owned the rock ‘n’ 
roll club and package store for 28 years, he said.
He said he is allowed to sell beer 
and wine over the bar on Sundays, and no packaged beer and wine may be sold.
“It would keep people out of 
trouble,” Fishman said. 
In Columbia County, you can sell 
beer and wine starting at 7 a.m. but with a cut-off time of midnight on Sunday, he said.
On every other day, he has to stop 
selling all alcohol at 1 a.m., an hour sooner than in Alachua County.
Fishman said the time cut also 
slashes his revenue by 25 percent.
“All these laws are crazy,” Fish-
man said. “There ought to be one consistent law with it all.”BLUE LAWS , from page 1“We’re so excited to be 
part of the driving force on

Regis’ retirement marks end of an era
It’s the end of an era, folks.
No, I’m not talking about the different freedoms 
currently at risk in America.
I’m not talking about the NBA lockout being lifted, 
either. Perhaps, by the time you’re reading this, the lock-
out will be reinstated — again.
I’m not even talking about the American staples of 
“All My Children” and “One Life to Live” being can-celed this year.
It’s the end of the Philbin era, ladies and gents.Regis Philbin’s last day as co-host of “Live With Regis 
and Kelly” was Nov. 18, and I think we all need to thank him.
He has been on television for 36 years, ever since 
hosting “AM Los Angeles” in 1975.
I would argue that Philbin has raised practically all 
of us. His morning talk shows have been there on any given weekday we happened to be home. We let him 
into our lives and our mornings as we heard about his 
life and his goings-on.
He retired from “Live” at 80 years old, and I think 
that’s quite a career. Sure, he had a hard time keeping up with the current technology trends — perhaps that’s 
part of the reason he chose not to renew his contract.
There’s going to be a generation of kids that won’t 
know who Regis is. Isn’t that strange?
They’ll never get to see this elderly man mess up the 
names of celebrities, be unable to use a phone or pretend 
to understand current events.
Thankfully, Kelly Ripa, Philbin’s co-host since 2001, 
will take over as the person whose face we associate with 
the show. I think this transition represents the changing 
of the generations. No longer will the co-host struggle to keep up with outdated references. No one will have to 
explain, then re-explain, what Twitter is.
Did Philbin leave because he felt, comparatively, like 
a dinosaur to everyone else around him? Maybe. Did he 
leave because at 80 years old there is basically nothing else to do but retire? Perhaps.The gap between the current 
parents/grandparents and the “youth”/“young profession-als” is kind of hilarious. We all 
have to answer questions about 
texting or using Facebook, but I 
think we hold our TV talk show 
hosts to a higher standard.
What’s next for “the Reeg?” 
Nobody knows. He’s written a 
memoir — published three days before his last “Live” 
show — so he’ll be around to promote it on all of the 
late-night shows, I’m sure.
Not everyone who “retires” from TV stays away for 
long. I’m looking at you Rosie, Oprah and Brad Gore-ski.
But would Regis have a place on TV anywhere else 
besides the morning? I think he left “Live” very grace-
fully (if you watched his final episode, I hope you had 
a box of tissues on hand) and shouldn’t try to rebrand 
himself to fit the needs of the current generation.
He had a good, long run. He currently holds the world 
record for spending the most hours on TV. By golly, I think he’s earned his retirement many times over. I think 
he could have retired a few years earlier before the cul-
ture and generation gap became even more obvious.
We should all be so lucky to have such a long and re-
warding career. While they may not break hard-hitting 
news stories, daytime talk shows should not be taken for granted. Everybody has his or her morning routine, 
and Regis has been a part of mine for nearly as long as I’ve been alive.
So thank you, Reeg, for being there when we all need-
ed a laugh, whether it was with you or at your expense. You always knew which was needed, and you are a true 
master of television. We should all be as “outta control” 
as you are.

Letter writer missed 
point of our editorial
In Monday’s issue of the Alligator, we printed a letter to the 
editor that we believe needs to be addressed. 
While we express sympathy for the horrible accident that 
the author experienced due to the recklessness of a drunken 
driver, we believe her conclusions about the point of our edito-rial are way off. 
First, we did not say that nausea and headaches were the only 
side effects of drinking alcohol. They are mainly characteristic of the morning after you drink. 
If our editorial was about the side effects of drinking alcohol, 
of which we believe a college audience should already be quite aware, we would have included impaired judgment, double vi-
sion, dizziness, impaired motor skills, etc. 
But that was not the point of our editorial. First, we were com-
mending UF for creating medical amnesty , saying that it was a 
step in the right direction to reducing alcohol-related illnesses. 
If a student is afraid to go to the hospital after having too 
much to drink, then he or she could be at risk for serious health problems. 
Second, we recommended that the stigma surrounding drink-
ing and alcohol needed to be removed by lowering the drinking age and allowing parents to properly teach their kids about the 
negative effects of alcohol. 
We believe that if students can learn at an earlier age what ef-
fects alcohol can have on their bodies, accidents like the author’s 
could be reduced. It would be foolish to think that people would 
never drink and drive again. 
We do not see how lowering the drinking age would increase 
the number of drunken drivers. The author did not mention 
in her letter the age of the driver who injured her. However, 
whether the driver was 18 or 25, it would not make the point of 
our article any less relevant. 
Drinking and driving is certainly a serious problem among 
adults and teenagers. But that is another issue entirely from 
what we presented.
Horrible accidents like the one experienced by the author has 
and always will be the consequence of people drinking irrespon-sibly . However, she is comparing apples with oranges. 
The Alligator is not trying to be “the cool big brother” for 
our readers. On our opinions pages, we strive to present well-
reasoned arguments for issues of the day. 
We do not feel that our readers came away from that particu-
lar editorial with the idea that a headache and nausea are the only consequences of consuming alcohol. 
This was not part of the argument we were trying to make, 
and our readers are smart enough to discern our main argu-ments. 
Again, what the author of the letter experienced was horrible, 
and we hope that no one has to go through that sort of ordeal. But her accusations against the Alligator are unjustified.

And boom goes the petrol bomb.
French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo (Char -
lie Weekly in English) recently published a front page 
caricature of the prophet Muhammad with a caption that read, 
“100 lashes if you don’t die of laughter.”
Consequently, the Charlie Hebdo offices were blown up 
with a petrol bomb. Petrol, another name for gasoline, is ap-parently a cheap and effective way of making a household ex-plosive device because it took a very short time for some crazy terrorist to put it to use.
Depictions of the prophet Muhammad are extremely offen-
sive to Muslims. Despite this, many French Muslims came out in support of Charlie Hebdo and freedom of the press, citing it as important even if the content is not always sensitive to 
Muslims. They are asking Muslims not to take the depiction 
too seriously and calling for peace.
But this isn’t the first time we have seen outcries against 
broadcasting or publishing depictions of Muhammad. Even “South Park” depicted Muhammad in a bear suit, caving to the fear of possible backlash if they actually showed the figure without a disguise.
Want to know what makes this situation even better? Char -
lie Hebdo “has reproduced the image with other caricatures 
in a special supplement distributed with one of the country’s leading newspapers,” according to 
Reuters.
This is a classic situation of who is 
the bigger jackass. On one hand, you have a newspaper that really is just 
begging to be attacked by printing a Muhammad cartoon. On the other hand, you have some pissed off radical Muslims who can’t take a joke.
As a member of the press, I think freedom of the press is a 
pretty good idea. That being said, the press has been known in the past to push the envelope on what is appropriate for print.
In doing this, Charlie Hebdo put the lives of employees and 
innocent bystanders at risk. And for what? What did they ac-
complish by publishing a Muhammad cartoon? Nothing.
However, Charlie Hebdo and all newspapers should be 
able to publish whatever they want without fear of violent ret-
ribution from any group, radical Islamists or otherwise.
Learning to take a joke is part of living in Western society.Nothing is sacred here — get used to it. If individuals 
fought every time someone insulted them, society would not function.
If a newspaper can print caricatures poking fun at Catho-
lic priests, then they sure as hell have the right to poke fun at Muhammad.
Whichever individual or group was behind the Charlie 
Hebdo attack needs to just kick back, down a six-pack and find a pretty lady in need of companionship. There is no better recipe for pacifism.
There is no such thing as a justifiable excuse to kill or at-
tempt to kill others in the name of religion.
I stand behind Charlie Hebdo. Its reprint of a caricature 
Muhammad after the attack shows defiance in the face of vi-olent extremism. The newspaper is now obviously aware of the dangers it faces by printing such a depiction, but Charlie Hebdo is fully within its rights to do so.
Any danger the newspaper faces is on its staff, but I would 
hope other newspapers around the world follow suit and print 
stories in the face of adversity or harm.
It all comes back to tolerance. Tolerance means being able 
to take a joke and not letting it phase you. Violence is the an-
tithesis of tolerance.
People make fun of Jesus. People make fun of Scientology. 
People make fun of Mormons. And people will continue to make fun of Muhammad. It’s high time to get over it and have a good laugh.

UWireWith the Occupy movement mak-
ing headlines and a dysfunctional Congress dragging our nation 
through the mud, Obama must hold to his principles if he wants to reunite with a dis-
illusioned public. 
Three years ago, on the night of the 2008 
election, I was covered with Champagne, 
having just flooded Broadway with a group of other Columbian students to rally into Harlem. The air was electrified. I looked at the New York City skyline from my Carman room, turned to my roommate and said, “Here comes the big Obama hangover.” 
But wide-eyed freshmen that we were, 
we expected that he would soon have his moment to shine. 
The democratic demand for uncondi-
tional, universal health care was finally conceivable. Republicans were not having it, but progressives held the House and the Senate. We were blue through and through, and this was our time. 
Public education would be salvaged, the 
Bush-era tax cuts for the rich would end, and Wall Street and the failing corporate 
megaliths would be forced to pursue their 
profits with more restraint. 
Obama wanted these things — he said 
as much in his election speeches. But then the fight for health care took a nasty turn. Extreme right-wing “Populists” heeded the ultrawealthy Koch brothers’ call to liber -
tarianism. On the surface, they looked like they might have had a legitimate stance. 
America has, after all, always had at its core 
a conflict between the romantic dreams of freedom and the declaration’s promise of equal opportunity. 
But this health care debate was a false 
dialectic. The fact is, ordinary Americans are doing worse than they believe. They have become con-vinced that if they rely on their own resources, they too can buy a yacht, a 
second home and several cars — the same delusion that the Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was well aware of when it bet against the subprime loans that Americans naively pounced on. 
Naysayers claimed that America was too 
far in debt to afford to support the bill, but its architects had taken measures that would ensure a lower impact on our budget. 
The public option could have been com-
pletely covered with taxes on the ultra-wealthy or with money originally allocated to handouts for that demographic.
It’s no wonder that top earners had no 
desire for this to happen. It is, however, a wonder that Republicans share that senti-ment. They are convinced that the system that allowed speculative capitalists to har -
vest the profits of America’s delusions will ensure their own prosperity. 
It is this judgment failure I hoped to hear 
called out by the Obama administration. In a united effort, many Americans elected Obama to regain their faith in the govern-ment. 
So, when he chose Ben Bernanke as the 
chairman of the Federal Reserve and backed down on his previously stated convictions in the name of “compromise,” their disap-pointment was understandable. 
Three years after the Champagne in the 
street, Columbians are still feeling the hang-over. Some say that Obama is cornered and that we must concede our ideals. I firmly disagree with that perspective.

A woman was in jail Mon-
day after smashing a coffee mug 
against her live-in boyfriend’s face Sunday night during an argument that ended in both of 
their arrests.  
Ebony Kelley, 25, was argu-
ing with her boyfriend, Andrew 
Vargas, 25, at about 10 p.m. Sun-day over his sleeping with an ex-girlfriend, said Cpl. Angelina Valuri, public information of-ficer for the Gainesville Police Department. 
They were in an apartment at 1018 NW Fourth Ave.  
Kelley hit Vargas in the cheek-
bone with a coffee mug, cutting his face, Valuri said. 
Vargas then “pinned her 
down, choked her, slammed her head into a door frame and ripped out some of her hair,” Valuri said.
Vargas then fled to the Kan-
garoo gas station at 926 W Uni-
versity Ave., where he called 911 
to get help for his injuries.  
Gainesville Police Depart-
ment officers found Vargas cov-ered in blood at the gas station, Valuri said.
He was taken to Shands at UF, where shards of the coffee mug were removed from his face.
Vargas was arrested and later 
taken to Alachua County Jail, as was Kelley, who was arrested back at the apartment, she said. 
While Vargas was charged 
with felony domestic battery by strangulation, Kelley was charged with domestic aggra-vated battery. 
Vargas was released without 
having to pay bond by order of the judge, according to the Ala-chua County Sheriff’s Office De-partment of the Jail. 
Kelley is being held in lieu of 
a $10,000 bond. Two arrested in lovers’ quarrel

Two city commissioners have picked the can-
didates whom they support to replace them.
Commissioner Jeanna Mastrodicasa, who 
holds the citywide At-Large 1 seat, has decided to 
support former commissioner Lauren Poe.
Commissioner Scherwin Henry , who holds the 
District 1 seat, is supporting Armando Grundy.
Both commissioners cannot run for re-election 
because they’ve reached the limit of two terms. Each term lasts three years.
Mastrodicasa said she supports Poe because 
they have similar stances. She said Poe worked to lower the city’s millage rates, which affect prop-erty taxes.Mastrodicasa worked with Poe during his 
three years on the City Commission, which ended 
when he lost his re-election race in the spring.
Henry said he’s mentored Grundy for two and 
a half years. He said Grundy has worked hard to 
get ready for this role.
Henry said Grundy approached him three 
years ago and asked for a chance to learn from him.
Since then, Henry said, Grundy’s been in-
volved in the city, serving on the Alachua County 
Charter Review Commission.
“He’s prepared himself to succeed me,” Henry 
said.
Grundy is an Army veteran who served in Op-
eration Enduring Freedom as a paratrooper.Candidates receive endorsementsBUY IT. SELL IT. FIND IT. 373-FIND

After resigning last December from Florida due to health and family concerns, former 
coach Urban Meyer accepted the head coaching job at Ohio State on Monday.
� HE SIGNED A SIX-YEAR DEAL.
MATT WATTS
Alligator Staff Writer
After evading for at least a week ru-
mors he would become Ohio State’s next 
head coach, former Florida coach Urban 
Meyer did just that Monday. 
Meyer signed a six-year contract 
worth $4 million annually, plus another 
$2.4 million in “retention payments.”
He will replace interim coach Luke 
Fickell, who took over the program after Jim Tressel resigned in May.
Fickell will remain on Meyer’s staff 
and will also coach the Buckeyes in their 
bowl game.
Meyer was announced as Tressel’s 
successor at a press conference in Co-
lumbus, Ohio, where he said becoming 
the next head coach at Ohio State was 
never a thought when he resigned from his position at Florida on Dec. 8. 
“In my mind, I was convinced I was 
done coaching,” he said. “I was con-
cerned with health issues. Family: I just 
wanted to be around them.”
Meyer took the past year off from 
coaching, working as an analyst with 
ESPN. But the draw to return to coaching 
was too strong, and when the job opened at Ohio State, Meyer pounced.
The difference this time, Meyer says, is he has found the balance necessary to function at a high and healthy level.
“I don’t want to be one of those guys 
that’s sleeping in the office saying, ‘I missed this, I missed that,’” he said. “Believe it or not, there’s lot of quality coaches out there that are still able to 
have a little bit of balance.”
Meyer’s first coaching job was as a 
graduate assistant with Ohio State in 
1987 under coach Earle Bruce. Meyer said his relationship with Bruce and his connection to the university were large 
factors in his decision.
“It’s great to be home,” he said. “I 
chose to pack up and move the most 
precious things in my life, and that’s my family, to back home. 
“And it’s a decision I’m very proud 
of, a decision that was not thought of overnight; a decision that had a lot of prayer, a lot of research. At the end of 
the day, to tell you we’re excited to be 
back, once again, is not a strong enough statement.”Former Florida coach Urban 
Meyer takes job at Ohio State

ORLANDO — Though the Gators 
didn’t play their prettiest game on Mon-
day night or win by their largest mar -
gin of the young season, they saw no problem in drenching their coach in a 
ceremonial Gatorade bath.
Despite missing an injured starter 
and losing a bench player to foul trou-
ble, No. 10 Florida (5-1) secured coach Billy Donovan a 400th career victory by beating Stetson 96-70 in Orlando’s Am-way Center.
“Yeah, I got (soaked) pretty good,” 
Donovan said. “I’m not sure who’s pay-
ing for the dry-cleaning bill, but it was 
special. Like I told those guys when I walked in there: Again, they’re a part of it too. … It’s nice when you can go in a locker room and you see a group of guys happy for 400 games.”
After Donovan changed into some 
fresh clothes, so did his team’s mental-ity on the game they just played. 
In the first half, the Gators were out-
rebounded 21-19 by the Hatters and were held scoreless during a four-min-
ute stretch late in the pe-
riod. 
S t e t s o n 
went on a 13-0 run during UF’s drought, 
and four different Gators failed to con-nect on six straight threes in the score-less spurt.
In a 14-of-35 shooting night for Flor -
ida where most of its long-range threats struggled, freshman Brad Beal proved 
to be a bright spot by draining five 
3-point shots and notching his second career double-double with a game-high Donovan reaches 400th win

As the Gators’ starter at point guard, se-
nior Lanita Bartley knows she needs to set 
the tempo.
Even so, what Florida does with the ball 
doesn’t keep her awake at night.
“I really don’t think about offense much, 
it just goes with the flow,” Bartley said. “If 
you get defensive stops, then the offense 
will come.”
Her offensive outburst against Charlotte 
(5-2) on Saturday, when she scored a career-high 28 points, tells a different story.
“When we’ve needed offensive produc-
tion, she’s been not just willing, but able to convert,” coach Amanda Butler said. “Not just take shots, but make shots.”
Florida (5-1) hopes that Bartley will con-tinue to have the hot hand tonight against Belmont (1-5) at 7 in the O’Connell Center.
As has been the case this season, Bart-
ley’s points Saturday came mostly from her play inside. She has attempted just seven shots from beyond the arc this season and 
made one 3-point shot 
in two attempts against 
Charlotte.
“They couldn’t stop 
my penetration,” Bartley 
said. “Coach tells me to 
shoot every day. When I turn down shots, she’s like, ‘You need to shoot 
the ball.’”
Bartley was 9-of-17 from the field Satur -
day, putting up many of her points in the Gators hoping Bartley stays 
hot tonight against Belmontsee MeYeR, PA ge 15

 She must have shed a tear for every 
mile away she was from home. 
  Her begging and pleading fell on deaf 
ears. America, a symbol of freedom for 
many, became a prison cell, holding her 
captive against her will.
  From the footsteps of Springs Hall, she 
watched, through teary eyes, her family 
begin their trek home to Australia. 
  Genevieve LaCaze was alone.   Born to Tony and Donna LaCaze, a for-
mer Australian professional rugby player and ballerina, respectively, Genevieve seemed destined for athletic success at 
birth. And with three brothers within two 
years of her, she grew up playing sports with the boys, pushing her to compete harder and stronger.
  “For fun, she and her younger brother, 
Henri, literally used to chase each oth-er around the outside of the house for hours,” Tony said of a young Genevieve growing up in Tamborine Mountain, Aus-tralia. “She was always exposed to sport. I 
(used) to take her and her brothers to the 
local pool before they were 6 months of age.”
  But the enthusiasm for running began 
with a move to a tiny town in Queensland called Daisy Hill. With a population of 
about 6,000 people, Daisy Hill was merely 
a blip on the map, but it was here where Genevieve struck gold. 
  The LaCaze family made the move 
in her ﬁ  fth-grade year, and immediately Donna wanted to get Genevieve involved in sports. She signed her daughter up for the school’s running club, and it became a family event. 
  “At school in Daisy Hill in the early 
days, all the children, including Tony and I and Gen’s dog, Oscar, would go to her 
training sessions and run with her,” Don-
na said.   “Out of the children, she excelled right from Day 1 at running.”
  Her mother was not exaggerating. 
Genevieve won her ﬁ  rst competitive race, the school-wide cross country meet. From there, she competed in district, regional and state meets, crossing the ﬁ  nish line in 
the top-10 every time.
  Genevieve’s potential, pinned on her at 
an incredibly early age, appeared to be met at just 10 years old. In the following years, 
there was no doubt she surpassed it.
  In sixth grade, Genevieve was runner-
up in the national meet, and a year later she claimed her ﬁ  rst national title. Start-ing in ninth grade at John Paul College 
in Daisy Hill, Genevieve took home her 
school’s honor of Athlete of the Year all four years.
  Along the way in high school, she won 
national titles in cross country, track and triathlons. As Australian competition proved to be an insufﬁ  cient challenge for Genevieve, she had her chance to shine worldwide during her senior year of high 
school.
  Under the leadership and success of 
Genevieve, John Paul College represented 
Australia in the 2006 cross country world championship in Italy. A sixth-place in-dividual showing, which helped lead her team to a fourth-place ﬁ  nish, was the pin-nacle of her high school career and gar-nered interest from universities across the 
globe.
  Todd Morgan, at the time an assistant 
coach for Florida, was intrigued.
  The young coach called Genevieve 
“tough” and “hard-nosed” coming out 
of high school and was eager to steal her away from Australia. However, he under-
stood how difﬁ  cult it is to make a major 
transition in life.
  “You never know how quickly some-
one is going to adjust, especially moving from the other side of the world,” Morgan said. “There is a different environment and different training.”
  Coming from a strict private Catholic 
school, Genevieve enjoyed the thought of coming to UF, where the lifestyle is more free and relaxed. However, it was moving 10,000 miles away that frightened her. Be-ing alone was petrifying to the girl who so closely relied on family.
  “Even though I was given all the free-
dom, I didn’t really want it at the time,” Genevieve said. “I was more willing to 
stay home and just be around my family.”
  But her family pushed her to leave. 
  “Donna and I both knew it was too good 
an opportunity to miss,” Tony said.  “Al-though we hated not having her around, we kept insisting to her that she should go. 
She was very reluctant.”
  Leaving her home country, where 
she accumulated myriad accolades and 
awards, was inconceivable to Genevieve. More importantly, leaving her comfort zone made her feel vulnerable. 
  The fear of loneliness was Genevieve’s 
chink in the armor, almost preventing her from competing in the states.
  So why not stay?  “Trust me, I tried,” Genevieve said. “I was offered a few scholarships over 
here (in America) and I came over and looked, and I did love Florida. The minute I saw it, I loved it. 
“But I just wasn’t willing to make that 
massive transition to leave my family and be over here. I was really petriﬁ  ed of 
the whole thought of it. But my parents wouldn’t have any of it, saying, ‘You’re 
going; that’s the end of it.’”
  Just like that, Genevieve became a 
Gator. Just like that, Genevieve was in a 
country that was as unfamiliar with her as 
she was with it.
  From being the darling of Daisy Hill, 
Genevieve became just another athlete for the Gators. This realization and strong de-sire to return home drove her into a spi-raling depression that dominated the ﬁ  rst few weeks of school.
  Running was the only thing keeping 
her head above water.
  A ﬁ  rst place-ﬁ  nish at the Mountain 
Dew Invitational, the Gators’ annual home meet, kicked off her collegiate rac-ing career. She went on to ﬁ  nish ﬁ  rst for Florida twice more that year, including the regional and national meet. Her ex-cellence on the course led her to winning Southeastern Conference Freshman of the 
Year, and earned her spots on the All-SEC 
and All-SEC Freshman Teams, as well as 
on the All-South Region Team.
  “I think, 100 percent, if it wasn’t for 
running so well and being so successful in 
that ﬁ  rst year, I honestly don’t know if I would have made it,” Genevieve said. “I just didn’t know if I could stick it out. But running was the only thing I could escape 
to that made me feel a little bit more at 
home.”
  Clinging to her sport as her lifeline, 
she pulled through the difﬁ  cult ﬁ  rst year. Each year came easier to Genevieve, gain-ing comfort and conﬁ  dence along the way, as well as awards.
  Boasting ﬁ  ve of the top-10 times in 
Florida history, Genevieve has earned her 
spot among the elite runners of the sport. 
Four years of work culminated in her ﬁ  nal race, the NCAA National Championship on Nov. 21. Her 42nd-place ﬁ  nish gave her the school’s second best national champi-onship performance since 1997.
  But maturing outside the sport has 
been Genevieve’s proudest accomplish-ment. A college experience marred early by loneliness has come full circle, with her becoming a leader, mentor and friend to others, like sophomore Cory McGee.
  “Even away from running, Gen is one 
of the most enjoyable girls to be around,” McGee said. “She’s a good friend and 
good teammate so it’s going to be hard not 
having Gen here. She’s like the glue of the team; she keeps us all together.”
  The team will move on, as will Gen-
evieve. 
  But with the clock winding down on her 
college experience, she can’t ﬁ  nd the heart to say goodbye, not to her new home.
  “I never thought that I would ﬁ  nd 
somewhere else that I could consider home. But I actually ﬁ  nd myself calling Gainesville my home all the time.” 14, ALLIGATOR   TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 29, 2011

place in his memory. 
“My six years in Florida, Florida was 
my dream job,” he said. “Everybody says: 
Is Ohio State your dream job? That’s a term that’s thrown around really loosely.
 “I will always be a Gator, will always

Athletic Director 
Jeremy Foley released a statement wishing 
Meyer well and thank-
ing him for what he 
did during his time at Florida. 
“We will always be indebted to Urban 
Meyer and his contributions to the Uni-versity of Florida,” Foley said. “He ele-vated our program, winning multiple na-tional championships and made a strong 
impact in this community. 
“Over the past 11 months, he has clear -
ly had an opportunity to determine that 
now is the right time to return to coach-
ing. He is good for college football and 
we knew he would return to the sidelines to coach again. We wish nothing but the best for him and his family as he embarks 
on a new chapter in his career.”

She attempted a team-high eight layups against the 
49ers, making six of them.
“‘Slippery’ is one of the ways we like to describe 
her,” Butler said. “It’s really amazing how she gets to 
the rim a lot of times.”
Bartley’s insistence on driving the lane also helped 
her pad her scoring effort via the free-throw line. She was perfect against the 49ers, making nine attempts from the charity stripe.
Overall, Florida’s free-throw percentage was 85.2 
percent against Charlotte, a performance that im-proved the Gators’ season percentage to 68.9, the sec-ond-best mark in the Southeastern Conference.
“It was just a must,” Bartley said. “The game was 
close and we really needed to hit those free throws.”
In addition to defeating Charlotte, Florida earned 
an 85-74 victory against La Salle (2-5) last Friday as part of the Courtyard LaGuardia Turkey Classic in 
Brooklyn, N.Y.
Bartley scored 16 points against the Explorers and 
added nine rebounds, which gave her a two-day total 
of 16 boards.
Junior forward Jennifer George, who grabbed 24 
rebounds, was the only Gator to best Bartley.
“That’s probably the thing that makes people 
scratch their heads the most,” Butler said.
“For her to come up with eight rebounds or nine 
rebounds and she just seems to do it and does it on a consistent basis — it certainly isn’t a fluke.”
Through six games, Bartley’s 37 rebounds are the 
second most on the team behind George’s 54.
The 5-foot-6 guard may be the shortest player on 
the UF roster, but she believes that she succeeds be-cause of her height.
“They just forget about me sometimes,” Bartley 
said, “so I just make sure I crash.” TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 29, 2011 § ALLIGATOR, 15

Freshman Beal scores game-high 22, notches double-double in win
22 points and 10 rebounds.
For the second consecutive game, Beal was forced into 
the power forward slot at times due to foul trouble by UF’s 
traditional big men and 6-foot-10 junior Erik Murphy’s knee injury. Forward Casey Prather fouled out with 6:14 left and 
starting center Patric Young was limited with four fouls.
“I wouldn’t say it had fallen on my shoulders really be-
cause everyone’s rebounding,” Beal said. “Coach Donovan is always on me about rebounding, so I just tried to do what-
ever it took to push it on the offensive end and try to re-
bound as much as I could.”
Beal’s game-best nine defensive boards, including five 
in the second half, helped the Gators regain their pace and 
limit the Hatters to just four second-chance points after al-lowing seven in the opening 20 minutes.
“I felt like that was going to be a key in the second half, 
that we could not give up second shots because when we were getting out on the break, good things were happen-ing,” Donovan said. Though guards Kenny Boynton and Mike Rosario ended 
the game a combined 5 of 15 from three, the 5-foot-8 Walker 
was able to battle back from a poor shooting start by hitting 
4 of 5 shots in the last 12 minutes. He finished with 21 points and a game-best six assists.
“Coach Donovan just told us we always got to come 
out and be aggressive no matter who the team is and that Stetson had a weaker team, but they are good enough to beat us,” Walker said. “We listen to everything he says and we believe in him, so we knew we had to be ready to go.”

Since reports began to surface 
last week about former Flori-da coach Urban Meyer taking 
the job at Ohio State, I have heard a lot of different reactions from 
Gators fans.
Some feel betrayed. Some feel 
they were lied to. Others are disap-
pointed or frustrated with the way everything played out.
However, there’s one reaction 
I have yet to see from the Florida faithful — empathy.
I understand all the negative re-
actions from Florida fans; it’s frus-trating to see your coach retire, and then come back not even a year later to take his “dream job.”
But that’s exactly what Meyer 
did. He took his dream job. The op-portunity of a lifetime approached him, and when it knocked Mon-day, he answered.
Fans should understand that 
when Meyer announced his retire-ment last Dec. 8, he didn’t know the Ohio State job would open up this year. While the tattoo scandal surfaced in late December, Meyer couldn’t predict Jim Tressel’s han-
dling of the situation would cost 
the Ohio State coach his job months later.
When he stepped aside for 
health concerns and to spend more time with his family — watch his daughters play college volleyball and serve as a coach for his son’s Little League team — he had no 
idea what the future held. He 
walked away from Florida because the job consumed him, and he knew he couldn’t handle it at the time.
“Florida deserves the best, and 
I’m not sure we gave them our best this year,” Meyer said in Decem-ber.
He didn’t lie to fans. He didn’t 
betray them, either. He was con-vinced he was done coaching a year ago, he said at 
his intro-
ductory  Buckeyes press con-
ference Monday night.
Meyer gave everything he had to 
Florida for six seasons. He brought two Southeastern Conference titles, two BCS championship trophies 
and 65 wins to Gainesville, not to 
mention the millions of dollars he helped bring in to the school as a result of those accomplishments.
After giving his all to Florida, 
his health included, Meyer made the best decision for himself last year when he retired. He did the same thing Monday, when he 
agreed to a six-year, $24 million 
contract to become the head coach at Ohio State, with millions more in bonuses and “retention pay-ments.”
For as long as Meyer has been 
coaching, Ohio State has been his 
dream job. He’s from Ashtabula, 
Ohio, which is 195 miles from Ohio State’s campus. His first college coaching gig was as a graduate assistant for the Buckeyes in 1986 under coach Earle Bruce.
While at Utah, Meyer had a 
clause in his contract that would allow him to bolt for OSU with-
out penalty if the opportunity ever 
presented itself.
If anyone should feel any sense 
of betrayal, it should be the players Meyer left after the Outback Bowl. But they don’t seem to feel that way. A couple, like offensive line-man James Wilson and linebacker Jon Bostic, didn’t have a comment 
Saturday on the situation.
Others, like linebacker Jelani Jenkins, took to Twitter on Mon-
day and said that while it came as “a shock,” the Gators will “be fine.” Wide receiver Andre Debose even posted he’s “not mad at all.”
“Not a problem with me,” de-
fensive tackle Omar Hunter said Saturday. “If he wants to be at Ohio State, good luck to him. I love coach Meyer. He brought me here to Florida. I can never say anything bad about coach Meyer. I respect him a lot; I love him as a coach. If he wants to go to Ohio State, good 
luck to him.” 
If Meyer’s former players don’t 
feel angry and betrayed, why 
should the fans?
Instead, fans should empathize 
with Meyer, because he is human, and he’s bound to do what’s in his best interest.
You and I would do the same.

� HE HAD 10 POINTS AND 11 RE-

ORLANDO — For as long as junior for -
ward Erik Murphy is going to be sidelined by 
a meniscus tear in his right knee, the Gators are going to rely on sophomore Will Yeg-
uete. 
If Monday’s game against Stetson is any 
indication, Yeguete is up to the challenge. 
Making only his second career start, Yeg-
uete recorded his first double-double, scoring 
10 points and hauling in 11 rebounds. 
Still, when asked about Yeguete’s perfor -
mance after the game, coach Billy Donovan’s 
first thought was on the sophomore’s short-comings. 
“We’ve got to work on his layups,” Dono-
van said. “Still need to work on layups.”
Yeguete missed five layups Monday, the 
only blemishes on his 4-of-9 shooting perfor -
mance and a clear reminder that he’s a differ -
ent player from Murphy. 
“He doesn’t shoot the ball like Erik does 
from the perimeter, but he does get in there 
and rebound,” Donovan said. “He makes hustle plays. He’s really good in the front of the press.”
Yeguete’s hustle has been evident on the 
stat sheet throughout his career. Last season, he led UF in rebounds per minute by a com-fortable margin and would have posted the best offensive rebound percentage at 20.2 percent — the percentage of available offen-
sive rebounds Yeguete grabs when he’s on 
the court — in the nation if he had played enough minutes to qualify. 
That continued Monday, as Yeguete 
grabbed six offensive boards in his 26 min-
utes of action. 
He was also a force at the top of UF’s press, 
recording a game-high four steals. 
“Will is doing a lot of 
things,” Donovan said. “He’s really one of our bet-
ter defenders. He’s clearly one of our better rebound-ers.”
But, outside of that, Yeg-
uete’s game still appears to be limited. 
He turned the ball over 
twice against Stetson after leading the team in turnovers per minute last season, and Don-
ovan said early in the game Yeguete forced 
layups and put-back attempts when passing might have been a better option. 
But, facing a similar situation later in the 
contest, Donovan said Yeguete made the 
right move by passing the ball out, showing 
his capacity to grow and learn as his career progresses. 
“He’s just got to get better with the ball, 
making decisions,” Donovan said. “He’s get-ting better.”
His improvement, as well as the develop-
ment of sophomore swingman Casey Prath-er, will be critical as long as UF is forced to 
play without Murphy. 
“For someone like him playing limited 
minutes, and Casey last year playing limited 
minutes, now that they’re getting an oppor -
tunity to play more, I think that they’re get-ting more and more comfortable,” Donovan said.
