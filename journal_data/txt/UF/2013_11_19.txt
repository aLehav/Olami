After receiving hazing allegations 
against several fraternities, UF admin-
istrators are enacting changes in pledg-ing processes.
Vice President for Student Affairs 
Dave Kratzer outlined the new rules in a letter sent Monday to all 61 Greek organizations.Chapters are now 
prohibited from con-ducting new member 
education programs for longer than eight weeks. They can’t host events where new members must stay in the house 
overnight, and they 
can’t enforce pledge driving — a prac-tice that requires new members to 
drive initiated members places at any time. An alumnus, alumna or chapter adviser approved by the organiza-tion’s headquarters must be present at initiation during the Spring as well, ac-
cording to the letter.
“I think if we’re going to change the 
culture, we need to send a strong mes-
sage,” Kratzer said in an interview. “Anything that takes away from or di-minishes academic success is not OK.”

INCLUDED 500 RESIDENTIAL UNITS, 142 HOTEL UNITS AND 1,131 PARKING SPACES.

City ofﬁ  cials moved to halt a company’s applica-
tion to handle the makeover planned for the corner 
of University Avenue and 13th Street during a City 
Commission meeting Monday.
The University Corners project is a proposed de-
velopment that would cover three city blocks that 
currently sit vacant next to the Gator Wesley build-
ing.
University Development of Gainesville has placed 
a bid on the project and is requesting $48 million in 
reimbursement from the city over a 20-year period.
In the meeting, Community Redevelopment 
Agency spokeswoman Lynn Janowski said the com-
pany failed to submit all of the necessary informa-
tion on its application to the agency, which handles bids on this project. 
The latest version of the plan application includes 
500 residential units, 142 hotel units, 78,330 square 
feet of retail space and 1,131 parking spaces.
The total project cost is estimated at $168 mil-
lion.
The redevelopment agency received University 
Development of Gainesville’s ﬁ  rst application in 
February and a revision in April.
“After that ﬁ  rst application, we saw there was 
missing information,” Janowski said. “And that there were a number of reasons the application 
could’ve been declined.”Company’s

Vegetarians like 18-year-old Annika Goldman can rejoice: 
Subway will be included in the Spring 2014 meal plan.
During October, residential, commuter and faculty and staff 
meal plans were accepted at Panda Express, Arredondo Cafe, 
Subway and Chick-ﬁ  l-A during a one-week trial period, wrote 
Gator Dining Services marketing program manager Jill Rodri-
guez in an email. Customers were able to vote electronically for their favorite location from Oct. 30 to Nov. 3.Out of a total of 1,716 ballots cast, Subway collected 46.5 per-
cent of the vote — a majority.
Rodriguez said all meal plan participants will be able to use 
their meal plans once a day after 4 p.m. at all three Subway locations on campus. Subway’s operational hours for Spring 2014 will be posted Dec. 1.
Goldman, a UF behavioral and cognitive neuroscience 
freshman, said she was happy when she received an email stat-
ing that Subway was added to the meal plan.
“Subway has a lot of variation and vegetarian options,” she 
said.
Subway joins a total of 11 locations that will accept meal 
plans in January, including Moe’s Southwest Grill, Pollo Tropi-
cal, Burger King, Papa John’s, Croutons, Home Zone, Chomp It, Camellia Court Cafe at the Samuel P. Harn Museum of Art, Gator Corner Dining Center and the Fresh Food Company.Gators can eat fresh in Spring: Subway to be included in meal planSEE GREEK, PAGE 4

The City Commission held a meeting at City Hall on Monday afternoon 
to discuss issues such as developing a plan for University Corners. 
Commissioners wanted more speciﬁ  cs
The company did not provide details on how 
it would meet the affordable housing require-
ment, failed to meet eligibility criteria and asked 
for more funding that it was eligible for.
The redevelopment agency recommended the 
City Commission reject the application because University Development could not give details 
about how much speciﬁ  c housing units would cost in the development.
“At the end of the day, we’re ﬁ  nancing this 
thing,” said Commissioner Todd Chase. “They 
want a lot of money to go towards this project, 
so we should at a minimum have exactly the 
same information that the banks and the ﬁ  nan-ciers have.”
The meeting lasted about ﬁ  ve and a half hours. 
By the end, the commission had moved to 
decline University Development of Gainesville’s 
application.
Commissioner Lauren Poe said he wanted to 
keep working with the company and with the 
Community Redevelopment Agency to iron out 
more speciﬁ  cs in the proposal.
“I want to move towards a method where we 
can more clearly identify costs,” Poe said.CORNER , from page 1� THE EVENT STARTS AT 7 P.M.

With Alachua County ranking fourth in Florida 
with the most cases of sexually transmitted diseas-
es, the annual World AIDS Day celebration is aim-ing to reverse the statistics. 
The celebration will be held tonight at 7 p.m. in 
the Reitz Union Rion Ballroom.
The event is hosted by the Respect Yourself, 
Check Yourself, Protect Yourself Movement to raise awareness about the ﬁ  ght against HIV.
“The celebration is a philanthropic event that 
consists of food and student performances,” said Isis Barnes, a 20-year-old UF biology junior and president of the organization.
Performers are required to incorporate HIV awareness into their performances. But the high-light will be the keynote speaker, she said. 
“We aren’t releasing the name of the speaker 
yet, but she has a powerful story,” Barnes said.  
She said the event makes the community aware 
of the resources the organization offers such as free STD and HIV testing.
“It’s a great way to let people know who we are, 
what we do and what we stand for,” Barnes said. “It also allows people to become more knowledge-able about STDs and HIV/AIDS while not being afraid to talk about it.”
This year’s philanthropic proceeds will go to 
Black AIDS Services and Education, an organiza-tion that offers information and resources to the Gainesville community, Barnes said.
Allison Hicks, special events director of the or-
ganization, said last year the group raised about $200. Hicks said it hopes to raise more than $400 this year.Students to recognize Annual 
World AIDS tonight at Reitz10 fraternities investigated
hazing allegations include Sigma 
Nu, Alpha Tau Omega, Beta Theta Pi, Chi Phi, Kappa Alpha Order, Phi Delta Theta, Pi Kappa Alpha, Tau Epsilon Phi, Theta Chi and 
Zeta Beta Tau.
One fraternity — Sigma Nu — is 
also facing formal charges of haz-
ing and alcohol violations, accord-ing to a UF Dean of Students Ofﬁ  ce charge letter.
The organizations will be un-
able to take on new members next semester unless they appeal the al-
legations to a committee headed by 
Jen Day Shaw, UF’s associate vice president and dean of students.
Shaw said the appeal route is 
expedited from the normal conduct and conﬂ  ict resolution sequence to ensure the chapters can address al-legations before the Spring semes-ter starts.
Ofﬁ  cials notiﬁ  ed national rep-resentatives and alumni as well as active members of the changes, Kratzer said.
“We want to have the entire fra-
ternity structure look like this,” he said. “I’m conﬁ  dent that our Greek system can be better than what it is.”
During the Spring and Summer 
semesters, eight fraternities faced formal charge letters, mostly per-taining to hazing and alcohol viola-tions. 
All charges have since been re-
solved, said UF spokeswoman Jan-ine Sikes.
Recently, Kratzer said, the uni-
versity has taken preventative 
strides to improve Greek life, and 
this is just another step.
“I think we’re reminding them of 
what their stated purpose and goals are and saying, ‘Look, we’re go-ing to hold you to that standard,’” he said. “I’m conﬁ  dent they’ll get there.”GREEK , from page 1

When Stephany Vazquez 
was taken to the hospital at 13 
years old to get morphine for 
her cramps, her mom realized 
her daughter’s menstrual pains weren’t normal.
Vazquez, now an 18-year-
old communication sciences and disorders freshman, found out she had ovarian cysts on both of her ovaries when she was 13. 
She started her period at 
the age of 10. 
It took her three years after 
the pain began to see a doctor.
“I was in this tremendous 
amount of pain, and my mom said she didn’t want her child going through this,” she said.
About 73 percent of women 
who experience pelvic pains have never seen a doctor for it, according to a new UF study. 
Dr. Nash Moawad, head of 
minimally invasive surgery in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at UF, was the physician leader for the research. 
The study, “Attributes 
and Barriers to Care of Pelvic Pain in University Women,” found 284 of the 390 women surveyed experienced some 
type of pelvic pain. 
Only 75 of those women 
had seen a doctor for their 
pains. 
The study was published 
in the November issue of the Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology.
“Some women think 
it’s normal to have painful periods,” Moawad said. 
Women may think, “‘I’m 
going to live the rest of my life expecting that it’s part of 
being a woman.’ This is not 
true,” he said.
Vazquez said she thought 
her pains ran in the family 
because her mom had painful 
menstrual cycles growing up.“Not a lot of girls had 
gotten their period yet,” Vazquez said. “So it was hard to explain to the teacher why I would have to go home so 
much.”
Vazquez would get the 
pains a few days before her 
cycle started. 
When she was 15, she 
went to see an OB-GYN who suggested birth control to help 
ease the pains.
“Ever since I’ve been on 
birth control, it has helped me 
a ton,” she said.Most women who experience 
pelvic pain don’t see a doctor
“Some women think 
it’s normal to have

� POLICE SAID A MAN MADE SEXUAL 
ADVANCES ON 10TH STREET.

Alligator Staff Writer kvarn@alligator.org
Gainesville Police ofﬁ  cers are looking for 
a man who reportedly made sexual advances 
to two people Monday night on a street a few blocks from UF’s campus.
At about 8 p.m., a caller reported to police 
that a man masturbated in front of her and a friend in the 100 block of Northwest 10th Street. The man tried to approach them, but the caller kicked the suspect and ran away with her friend. 
Police are investigating the case as an at-
tempted sexual battery.
The suspect had run away by the time ofﬁ  cers arrived, according to police. He was described as a 150-pound black male at 25 years of age with a square face and close-
shaven haircut. 
He was last seen wearing a black jacket 
with gray sweatpants, according to police. 
A UF Alert was sent at about 10:15 p.m. 
warning students and faculty of the incident. 
The alert advised students to stay in well-lit areas, walk on the side of the street facing trafﬁ  c and avoid hitchhiking. 
It also suggested students use Student 
Nighttime Auxiliary Patrol for nighttime transportation and that they notify others of their whereabouts.
Anyone with information that could help 
identify the suspect is encouraged to call 352-955-1818 or to text GPDFL plus a tip to 274637.UF warns about sexual batteryLOCAL

Gainesville’s Little Ones program is 
celebrating its 35th year organized by the 
city.
This holiday season, residents can 
“adopt” children from families who are ﬁ  -
nancially struggling by committing to give 
gifts and food to them and their families. 
Usually, the adopters are employees 
of the City of Gainesville and community members.
The families up for adoption this year 
are from the Children’s Medical Services and Department of Children and Families.
Donations for the families will be taken 
until Dec. 14 and will be distributed at a Christmas party, where all of the families will receive a dinner basket and gifts.
Susanne Olivas, Gainesville’s Little 
Ones program coordinator, said it has ad-opted about 30 families every year in the past.  
“It is ﬁ  nancially difﬁ  cult for many fami-
lies to provide for each other, especially this time of the year,” Olivas said. “So it would be great to see the program exceed the number of families and children over-all.”
Trung Phan, a 20-year-old UF advertis-
ing junior, said he hopes the community takes the time to give.
“I’m really glad there’s a program in the 
community that gives back to those who are in need,” Phan said. “I hope I can do 
the same in the future.” City helps ‘adopt’ local kids

and  socks: 
Buying with Bitcoins 
Bitcoin, the purported digital currency of the future, made 
headlines yesterday. In addition to having leapt in value — one bitcoin is now worth more than $550 and growing 
— U.S. agencies met with a Senate committee in order to sell the idea that bitcoins are “legitimate ﬁ  nancial instruments,” accord-
ing to Bloomberg. 
Representatives from the U.S. Department of Justice and the 
Securities and Exchange Commission met with the Senate com-
mittee to explore potential “promises and risks” associated with  virtual currency. However, will Bitcoin’s reputation hinder it from being widely accepted?
Bitcoins are notorious for being used on the Silk Road web-
site in exchange for drugs, guns and murder-for-hire. They’re the perfect method of exchanging money, as the virtual cur-
rency is designed to be untraceable. Most alarming, perhaps, is 
the boom of the online “assassination market,” which relies on bitcoins as currency.
Forbes writer Andy Greenberg posted an article yesterday 
about the budding murder-for-hire market. 
“Last month I received an encrypted email from someone 
calling himself by the pseudonym Kuwabatake Sanjuro, who pointed me towards his recent creation: The website Assassina-tion Market,” Greenberg wrote, “a crowdfunding service that 
lets anyone anonymously contribute bitcoins towards a bounty 
on the head of any government ofﬁ  cial — a kind of Kickstarter for political assassinations.”  
Yikes. The Assassination Market’s end goal, Greenberg re-
ported, is to murder so many politicians that people will eventu-ally become discouraged from taking political ofﬁ  ce, therefore reducing the U.S. to an anarchist state. 
“Sanjuro didn’t actually invent the concept of an anonymous 
crowdfunded assassination market,” Greenberg wrote. “The 
idea dates back to the cypherpunk movement of the mid-1990s, 
whose adherents dreamt of using encryption tools to weaken the government and empower individuals.”
Greenberg also writes that crowdfunded murder via bitcoins 
isn’t a new concept, either. 
“Other Tor-hidden websites with names like Quick Kill, Con-
tract Killer and C’thulhu have all claimed to offer murders in exchange for bitcoin payments,” he wrote. “But none of them responded to my attempts to contact their administrators, and 
all required advanced payments for their services, so they may 
be scams.”
Obviously, a few angry, extremist libertarians with money to 
blow on bitcoins aren’t going to overthrow the government any time soon. However, for legal businesses who want to use Bit-coin as a cheaper way to exchange money and for black markets like Silk Road, the anonymity of bitcoin use is appealing.   
The success of bitcoins is to be determined. Time will show if Bitcoin’s reputation as the untraceable 
currency-of-choice for criminals will keep it from becoming a “legitimate ﬁ  nancial instrument.”

Vote or post a message at www.alligator.orgFriday’s question: Are you happy UF is 
switching email systems? Today’s question: Do you think hazing is a problem 
at UF?Are gender roles still an issue today?
In case anyone missed the memo, we’re about to enter 
2014. If you did miss the memo, then you’re not alone, because Justin Lookadoo, an unfortunately promi-
nent speaker in public schools across the South, seems to believe this is still the 19th century. High schools invite Lookadoo to advise their students about dating as teenag-ers, but what they receive is a handbook on gender ste-reotyping.
Someone let this guy publish a book called “Dateable,” 
which examines the roles of teen boys and teen girls in high school relationships and provides rules for each gen-der, which he claims are based on the Bible. Sadly, this is less a moral guidebook and more a runaway train into the Dark Ages driven by an extremist conductor with bleached, spiky hair. He’s reinforcing gender roles and calling it “advice,” and public schools are validating him by asking him to speak about it.
His most concrete advice given in a speech to a Texas 
school was that “God made guys as leaders” and girls should just let them “do guy things” like “get a door and open a ketchup bottle.” Being a leader and man-handling a condiment are two different things, and both genders were endowed with the volition, as well as the ability, to lead and twist off a lid.
One look at his website — where the dateable rules are 
listed — and it’s easy to see why students and parents are outraged at his message. The Dallas Morning News sum-marized his lessons to the kids in one sentence: “Being a man means protecting the weak — and women.” 
He said the most dateable girls “know how to shut up,” 
and then he accused teen girls of being their own worst enemies, saying, “The reason it’s so hard for you to suc-ceed these days is not because of guys. You’re doing it to yourselves.” 
With such speciﬁ  c and constructive advice, it’s no won-
der the girls at these schools have begun speaking out on Twitter and in letters to their schools.Lookadoo doesn’t go easy on 
the guys, either. “Somewhere be-tween the modern church and the feminist movement, guys turned into pansies,” he quipped. 
Apparently women’s equality 
comes with obligatory emascula-tion. He paints “dateable guys” as untamed crusaders, because 
“they don’t live by the rules of the opposite sex.” Instead, they “ﬁ  ght battles, conquer lands, and stand up for the op-pressed.” 
Can we get an old-school vaudeville hook over here, 
please? The Crusades are over.
More than one parent has written a strongly worded 
letter to his or her local school’s administration about the content of Lookadoo’s dating how-to rant, and rightly so. That this man is trying to uphold these stereotypes is one thing, but it’s even more problematic that the administra-tions in charge of America’s youth think these are impor-tant lessons to be learned.
Another unfortunate backlash here is that this guy as-
sociated himself with Christianity multiple times while vaguely citing the Bible. The students who don’t know much about Christianity may have walked away thinking every Christian views gender roles this way, an unfortu-nate and grossly untrue generalization — but one they can’t be blamed for.
While other states legalize gay marriage — something 
Lookadoo probably has plenty to say about — it seems like some Southern states are trying to perpetuate the an-cient, dichotomous gender roles we scoff at in our history classes. Perhaps social issues are never completely re-solved, but in any case, keep those strongly worded letters coming.

Apparently there is a bit of irony in the No-
vember air in Washington. More Americans have lost their health insurance because of 
Obamacare than Americans who have signed up for it. The president botched the health insurance 
exchange website, and the strong unity of Congres-
sional Democrats who pushed the Affordable Care Act through Congress and onto the American people is starting to chip away.
Fear not: Red-state 
Democrats have ﬁ  xes that can save Obamacare.  
Take Senators Joe 
Manchin (D-W.Va.) and 
Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), 
for instance. Manchin wants to delay the indi-vidual mandate and Sha-heen wants to extend the deadline for enrollment. They assume when the website is up and running again, the exchange market — with the help of their quick ﬁ  xes — will ensure the health care legislation 
is implemented smoothly.   
These “quick ﬁ  xes” — when you look at the larg-
er picture — will not help the Affordable Care Act. 
These remedies would gut the law. Manchin’s delay of the individual mandate and Shaheen’s deadline extension discourage the young, healthy invincibles from signing up for the exchanges. These invincibles will subsidize the older, sicker Americans. If young, healthy people do not sign up for the exchanges, the 
Affordable Care Act would go up in ﬂ  ames. 
No one is more vulnerable in the 2014 midterm 
elections than Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.). In order 
to save herself politically, she proposed legislation that would ensure that those people who have lost their health insurance because of the Affordable Care Act would get it back for a year.  
However, The Washington Post’s Ezra Klein said 
the Landrieu bill “will lead to a sicker, older risk pool 
… (and) higher premiums are a real danger.” This is 
not exactly what the chief executive wants. 
To the average American, these solutions seem 
like sensible ideas. Who would not like to keep their recently dropped health care plan for another year? Who wants to be forced into the health care exchange market in its shaky state? 
Obama told the press he would veto these con-
gressional ﬁ  xes if they passed Congress. He has good 
reason to because these solutions would undermine 
his signature piece of legislation. But deliberately saying no to pieces of legislation many people will believe could ﬁ  x the Affordable Care Act could be a political nightmare — not just for him, but for his congressional Democratic colleagues. Red-state Democrats told their constituencies they would be held accountable for Obamacare — even Sen. Lan-drieu. Good luck to her. 
It is unbelievable to think that the quick ﬁ  xes and 
solutions to Obamacare do not actually ﬁ  x or solve its problems. The legislation is unﬁ  xable. 
Yes, Obamacare does have provisions that many 
people like, such as eligibility for insurance even with preexisting conditions and allowing young people to stay on their parents’ policies until they are 26. 
But no one could predict all of the negative effects 
of the health care law, Obama included. All of the 
quick ﬁ  xes in the world cannot heal the wound of a 
president misleading the people.
What is left is a political nightmare for the Demo-
crats in the short term. A glitchy website, the drop-ping of health care plans and a lie to the American people are not things that many politicians would like to campaign on or defend. Even if the ﬁ  xes pro-posed undermine the law, looking like you are trying to solve the problem looks good politically. 
People thought the website glitches were the 
worst thing that could happen to Obamacare. But it appears it’s actually the Democrats.

Fifty years later, JFK’s most memorable quote 
remains: “Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your 
country.” President Kennedy’s greatest legacy ex-ists not in his executive orders or legislative ac-tions, but rather the commitment to service that he inspired in the American people. In public service and private charity, Kennedy’s encouragement deﬁ  ned a gen-eration. Through his lasting impact, Kennedy continues to inﬂ  uence America’s leaders and inspires students and citizens alike.
Kennedy’s commitment to service ran further than 
lofty speeches and tenuous encouragement. Rather, his own inspirational turn to public service demonstrated the extent to which he supported his own philosophy. After his brother Joseph Kennedy Jr.’s death, JFK himself en-tered into the “family profession” in order to better serve his nation in matters of “war and peace, prosperity and re-cession, (and) whether we look forward or into the past.”
Recalling his time at Harvard in a 1960 recording, Ken-
nedy remembered his future Senate rival Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.’s election to the Senate during Kennedy’s fresh-man year, in 1936. Remarking how he could never have thought he would eventually defeat the Senator in the fu-ture, Kennedy called upon others to consider public ser-vice, including the “freshman that would probably end up defeating (him) sometime.”
Similarly, Kennedy would prospectively encourage col-
lege students today to enter in public service. Naturally, then, Harvard’s own John F. Kennedy School of Govern-ment could not have received a more appropriate name.
Through institutions such as the Peace Corps, President 
Kennedy altered both American and international concep-tions of service. He believed service need not stop at na-tional boundaries. He thought America’s code of moral-ity must stand as a model for other nations, and America must be a people that demonstrate greatness worldwide.
In another testament to Kennedy’s inﬂ  uence, House 
Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi’s recent Radcliffe visit il-luminated Kennedy’s personal charm among the nation’s young people. Explaining her fondness for Kennedy in her youth, when her father was mayor of Baltimore, Pelosi’s story suggests that Kennedy’s voice carried far, and his call to action even farther.
Kennedy’s handsomeness and charisma may have con-
tributed to his 1960 electoral victory, but it is his ideal-ism and policy that contributed to his superior legacy and popularity. His presidential image was unique, but his in-ﬂ  uence was mainstream. Even Kennedy’s allegedly ques-tionable character would not detract from his legacy. 
For those who ascribe to him purportedly indecent ac-
tions, Kennedy’s legacy remains distinct. His actions as a person are one aspect, but the ideas that he stood for remain another. Regardless of what one suspects of the former, the latter remains unquestionably popular and ethical.
America remembers Nov. 22, 1963 for the loss 
of a leader who understood American values and generated enthusiasm for American exceptional-
ism. On the brink of turning a Cold War into a ho      t one in October 1962, Kennedy maintained that America would not yield to Soviet pressures. A ﬁ  rm believer that Amer-ica would triumph over communism, Kennedy knew the American “freedom experiment” would ultimately prove successful, and he brought the country together in a time of crisis.
Kennedy also uniﬁ  ed the American people across par-
ty lines. Kennedy espoused the ideals of both liberalism and conservatism. His conscientious regard for people’s welfare combined with his acceptance of economic liberty made Kennedy a bipartisan idol, unmatched in popular-ity.
It is Kennedy’s non-partisan character that best contrib-
utes to his positive impact. Consider another of Kennedy’s famous quotes:  “If by a ‘Liberal’ they mean … then I’m proud to say I’m a ‘Liberal.’” Subsequently listing com-passionate aspects of liberalism, Kennedy’s quote does as much to redeﬁ  ne liberalism as it does to redeﬁ  ne himself. 
Kennedy, a heavy defense-spending and tax-cutting 
capitalist at his core, argued not for Washington’s inter-ference in people’s welfare. Rather, Kennedy positively argued for inspiring people to provide for themselves and to further challenge them to provide for their country.
It is hard to ﬁ  nd a place for Kennedy in the modern 
political spectrum. A long-revered hero to the left, his actions more appropriately place him as a centrist. In some respects, Kennedy could be described as the best Republican president in recent times. At the same time, Kennedy’s commitment to the Democratic Party is well documented. Kennedy was certainly progressive in mat-ters of civil rights, women’s rights and other social issues. He challenged public perceptions and fought oppression. In that way, everyone can learn from Kennedy’s leader-ship. Amid tough political challenges of increasing polar-ization, Kennedy appears to be among the greatest role models for both the left and the right. In his image, let us hope to ﬁ  nd resolve.
A pragmatic politician but an inspirational ideologue, 
President Kennedy’s encouragement of public service should not be taken lightly. 
One of America’s greatest leaders was assassinated on 
Nov. 22, 1963, but his ideas live on. 
Fifty years later, we all share responsibility for keeping 
the torch burning.

Ten-foot tall posters displaying 
creationist beliefs stirred up contro-
versy on the Plaza of the Americas 
on Monday and left many students 
arguing.
The display was part of a three-
day exhibit by traveling pastor Tom 
Short, said Megan Lisle, an 18-year-
old UF anthropology freshman and member of Gator Christian Life, which helped bring Short to UF.
She said Short has been a fixture 
at UF every semester for years, but this is his first time using the post-ers.Each day has a theme, starting 
with the validity of the Bible on Fri-day, creationism on Monday and the life of Jesus today.
Lisle said she thinks the posters 
are a positive addition to Short’s campaign because of their conve-nience.
“You can just read it.,” she said. 
“You don’t have to stay for hours and listen to him.”
Megan Anderson, a 22-year-old 
University of North Florida elemen-
tary education junior, took a semes-
ter off to intern with Short. She said the mission was to spread the cre-ationist point of view, “because you aren’t taught that in school.”
Dan Miner, an 18-year-old UF 
aerospace engineering freshman, said that although he’s a Christian, he doesn’t believe sermons like this will do much to change minds.
“Large groups like this, it’s just 
reinforcement of what you already believe,” he said. “There’s such a polarization of belief.”
Tahlia Demaio, a 25-year-old UF 
astrophysics graduate student, said the posters made her sick to her stomach.
“We’re in front of a library, 
where’s there’s fact and truth and knowledge,” she said. “Creation-ism is wrong. It is a belief. It is not fact, and it shouldn’t be in front of 
a library.”8, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 19, 2013

Ramin Bastani has been 
called the safest man to have sex 
with in America — he has been tested for diseases more than 50 times in the last two years — 
and a new mobile application 
he developed might be able to give others this title, too.  
Hula, a free iPhone appli-
cation, derives its name from Hawaiian hula dancers because Bastani said he is looking to help people get “lei’d” the safe way. Hula account holders 
know where the nearest sexu-
ally transmitted disease testing center is, the results of a test and even when to get checked next, according to a news release. 
Bastani said he hopes Hula 
will encourage safe sex, po-tentially reversing trends that might be impacting the sexual 
habits of college students.
About 50 percent of sexually 
active college students use con-
doms, according to a recently released report by Trojan and the Sex Information and Educa-tion Council of Canada. 
Bastani said the app allows 
users to obtain records quicker 
and without having to get the 
dreaded, “If you don’t hear 
from us in two weeks, no news 
is good news,” statement from 
a medical health practitioner.
Currently, 75 percent of clin-
ics are able to send test results through the application, he said. 
Although the UF Student 
Health Center does not send results through the app, Cathe-rine Seemann, communications coordinator for the SHCC,  said about 60 students a week go into the SHCC for routine STD screening. 
In addition to providing in-
formation to stay on top of STD 
testing, Hula also allows you to 
share your STD test results with potential partners. When some-one creates an account on Hula, he or she has the option to dis-play his or her real name and most recent STD test results on an internal profile page, Bastani said.  
Samantha Evans, a specialist 
at UF’s GatorWell Health Pro-motion Services, said although the application could be help-ful for locating local test cen-ters, she’s wary about sharing results — something she said should be done in person.
“Those things are better 
done in person, and very often (news of) some, like HIV, have to be given in person by law,” she wrote in an email.
Chris Pereira, a 20-year-old 
public relations senior, said he thinks college students would use this app.
“In this day and age, people 
use their cellphones for every-thing,” he said. “So why not check their health?”iPhone app helps find

Laquan Johnson was cleaning her apart-
ment when she heard the gunshot.
Soon after, she heard screams so loud they 
popped her eardrums. Then, knocks from her 
neighbor’s cousin.
“Call the police,” the woman said.“What’s wrong?” Johnson, 37, asked.“My cousin is dead,” she replied. As the details unfolded, Johnson found out 
her neighbor, 22-year-old Caitlin A. Albritton, had been shot in the head by a former boy-friend Saturday afternoon at Village Green Apartments. According to police, the man broke into unit G-53 and was waiting for her 
to come home. 
Albritton, six weeks pregnant and the 
mother of two young children, died at the 
scene. 
A little more than 24 hours later, Gainesville 
Police arrested Alvin G. Thomas, the reported killer and father of one of Albritton’s children, at the Budget Inn on Southwest 13th Street. 
The shooting shook up neighbors. Some 
are sleepless and fearful. Some want to leave. 
Many said Albritton had just moved into 
the complex a few months earlier. They hadn’t had a chance to get to know her yet. 
However, one resident knew her from 
earlier days, when they attended Westwood Middle School and Gainesville High School together.
Kateece Graham, 22, said Albritton was 
friendly. When asked if Albritton was popu-lar, Graham let out a sigh and nodded.
“Everyone knew her. She was always 
there when you needed her,” she said. “You wouldn’t think it would’ve happened to her of all people.”  
Many neighbors at the complex live with 
young children, like 36-year-old Sheena Woo-
ten, who lives in an apartment with six chil-
dren and a clutter of toys. 
About a month ago, the Santa Fe College 
nursing student warmed up to allowing her children to play outside. Not anymore though, she said. In fact, she walks to her mailbox around her building to avoid the more direct route that passes by Albritton’s apartment.
“I am definitely looking for somewhere else 
to live,” she said as her 2-year-old son crawled around on the living room floor.
Resident Casey Rush said she felt the same 
way.  
On Saturday, she heard the gunshot while 
she stood outside on her balcony smoking a Newport with a friend.
Rush, 25, and her boyfriend ventured 
downstairs while her three young children stayed in the apartment. She peeked inside the 
door, open about halfway, and saw a body. Her eyes traveled up the legs, torso, but didn’t 
reach the face.
“I didn’t want to see her face,” she said 
Monday afternoon, flicking cigarette ash over the same balcony. 
Meanwhile, her children played inside. 
One of them, Rush’s 7-year-old daughter, is afraid to sleep.
“It’s too close to home, you know?” she 
said.
Thomas’ motive is unknown, but police are 
still investigating. Investigators determined 
his relationship with Albritton ended fairly 
recently. 
Rush heard from neighbors that Thomas 
was mad that Albritton didn’t want to be with him anymore. 
She recalled hearing the gunshot and then 
seeing a man leave the apartment with “no emotion on his face.”
“You see stuff like that on TV,” she said. “It 
just makes you open your eyes and see how 
real this stuff is.” Neighbors react to Saturday murder with shock, fear, moving plansCreationist exhibit causes controversy

� TWO-THIRDS OF COLLEGE 
STUDENTS HAVE USED A FAKE ID. 
DANIELA PRIZONT-CADO
Alligator Contributing Writer
College students who use fake IDs to 
buy alcohol are more likely to develop 
drinking problems down the road, according to a recent study.
Researchers at the University of 
Maryland said that about two-thirds of college students sampled have used a fake ID, and using one may contribute to the possibility of developing drinking 
disorders in the future.
Stephanie Lucena, an 18-year-old UF 
ﬁ  nance and information systems freshman, 
said using a fake ID may put students at a higher risk, “but it does not mean they will have a drinking problem.”
The study hinted there could be a 
correlation between the use of fake IDs and being involved in Greek life.
But Lucena, who is in coed business 
fraternity Delta Sigma Pi, said she disagrees. 
“We all have standards to uphold as 
a fraternity, and if anything happens, it’s their choice,” she said.
Kevin Chow, an 18-year-old UF biology 
freshman, said he knows people who sell and own fake IDs.
Chow said owning a fake ID can be 
risky.
“There’s always other ways of getting alcohol,” he said. “Possibly, if you know 
someone who is 21, or parties.”
But Chow said he understands that 
drinking can lead to serious consequences 
in the future. 
“There’s a reason why the drinking age 
is 21 and older … It’s not worth developing drinking problems for a cup of alcohol,” he said.
GatorWell Health Promotion Services’ 
director, Maureen Miller, said she agrees with the fact that students should wait to drink.
“The brain is still developing until your 
20s,” she said.Fake IDs contribute to future drinking disorders, study says

The average college student 
checks his or her cellphone about 
11 times a school day, according to a new study.
The study, published last 
month, showed that more than 90 percent of students admitted to using their devices in class for non-class activities.
The study, conducted at the 
University of Nebraska-Lincoln, surveyed 777 students in six uni-versities. More than two-thirds admitted to checking email or 
social networks in class on their 
mobile device or laptop.
UF was not one of the institu-
tions surveyed. 
Thomas Glenn, a UF gradu-
ate teaching assistant in French and Francophone Studies, said although he hates texting in his class, he knows people occasion-ally do it. 
He said when he was teaching 
middle school, he would put stu-dents’ phones in a shoebox and call it jail. 
But with students paying to 
take his class, he said, it’s the 
students’ responsibility to pay 
attention.
“If you’re not engaged, I can’t 
force you to be engaged,” he said.
Vicki Baker, a 20-year-old 
health science sophomore, said she thinks teachers can get dis-couraged when they see a class-
room full of texting students.
“It portrays to them that we 
aren’t engaged,” she said. “It also 
makes them feel like they aren’t doing a good enough job to keep our attention.”Most students use 
devices during class

The City of Gainesville’s three 
municipal swimming pools exceed-
ed attendance goals for the season, which ended Oct. 31. 
In the last year, patrons logged 
123,704 visits, according to a recent news release. Overall, attendance has tripled since 2007.
The Dwight H. Hunter “North-east” Pool, located at 1100 NE 14th St., is open year-round and had the highest reported attendance with 
nearly 60,000 visits last year, ac-
cording to the release. To record attendance, residents scan in with a membership card, and the data is sent to the city, said Ashley Miller, the Northeast Pool manager.
“In the early 2000s, no one would come,” she said. “Now we seem to be over capacity, and we have programs stacked back-to-back 
throughout the year.”
Gainesville resident Leah Vail 
practices her time-clock drills and 
pull-kicks at the Northeast pool twice a week to train for her next U.S. Masters Swimming event.
“I come here because of the friendly atmosphere,” she said. 
The city’s investment in the pools 
and the economic downturn that 
began in 2008 contributed to the in-
creased attendance, according to the release. 
“We have noticed more walk-
in people over time,” Miller said. “It seems to stay pretty constant throughout the year.”

Agata Strausa was one 
of two Gators to earn an at-large bid for the NCAA Championships. Read 
the story on page 14.Kickoff set
Florida’s game against Florida State on Nov. 30 at Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium will kick off at noon, the Southeastern Conference announced Monday.  JONATHAN CZUPRYN
 Alligator Writer @jczupryn
   Just two minutes into the second half of No. 16 Florida’s 
67-53 victory against Southern on Monday night, point 
guard Kasey Hill suffered a high left ankle sprain after be-ing fouled driving to the basket. 
  He did not return to the game, and coach Billy Donovan 
said he expects Hill to miss at least a month. If the initial diagnosis is correct, Hill would miss matchups with No. 18 Connecticut and No. 2 Kansas.
  Before Hill fell to the ﬂ  oor, Donovan 
said he heard him screaming. Seconds 
after Hill dropped, the team’s trainer, strength coach and Donovan raced to his side. The freshman had to be helped off the ﬂ  oor and into the locker room.
   “It’s one of those sprains where it’s 
certainly a longer healing process,” Don-ovan said. “And I know when you try to rush a guy back too soon, it really, really 
complicates things. ”
  At the time of the injury, Hill was leading Florida with 
eight points on 4-of-6 shooting. Six of his eight points were results of layups. He also had three assists.
  When Hill exited the game, Donovan played DeVon 
Walker and Michael Frazier II at point guard. Donovan said Walker has served as the backup point guard to Hill in practice this season, so he knows the most about running the position. 
  However, the offense will take a hit without Hill.  “The hardest part, for me, is it really eliminates a real op-
portunity to get creative on offense because you really have to shorten up the playcalls,” Donovan said. “For a guy like DeVon and Michael Frazier to know the two, the three and 
the point, their head would explode. It’s not fair to them.” Florida loses freshman guard in win against Southern
Kan Li / Alligator Staff
Kasey Hill lies on the ground after suffering an ankle injury during the second half of Florida’s 67-53 victory against 
Southern in the O’Connell Center on Monday. Hill is expected to miss at least one month due to a high ankle sprain.
  JOE MORGAN
 Alligator Staff Writer @joe_morgan
  Tyler Murphy was frustrated.
  After three years on the bench, he 
ﬁ  nally earned his shot to play during 
Florida’s 31-17 win against Tennessee 
on Sept. 21. Not even two months later, a sprained AC joint in his right shoul-der had him back on the sidelines.
  “I caught myself being down a lot 
just knowing I wouldn’t be able to go out there and play that day,” Murphy said.
  Like before, during his days as a 
backup, Murphy does not know when he will next take the ﬁ  eld. After aggra-vating his shoulder injury in a 34-17 loss to Vanderbilt on Nov. 9, Murphy 
needs approval from the training staff 
before taking the ﬁ  eld again.
  “It’s just tough,” Murphy said. “It’s 
very tough being on the side.”  It’s a struggle many Gators continue 
to endure.
  Left tackle D.J. 
Humphries is doubtful to play against Georgia 
Southern on Saturday. An MCL sprain 
has already sidelined the sophomore 
for three games.
  Marcus Roberson could also miss 
Saturday’s contest with an ankle in-
jury. He was suspended for Florida’s 
19-14 loss to South Carolina, a game he would have missed regardless due to the injury.
  In the midst of a ﬁ  ve-game losing 
streak — the Gators’ longest such skid since a winless 1979 season — an al-ready injury-ravaged Florida would like all hands on deck moving forward.

 I’m not much of a fan of extended meta-
phors. 
  They’re contrived. They’re cheesy. 
Often times, they have to be stretched and molded in weird shapes and forms to make 
any sense. 
  But indulge me for a moment while I use 
one to make a point. 
  Have you seen ‘The Dark Knight’? 
  (Of course you have. It is an excellent ﬁ  lm 
full of excellent acting and has an excellent plot. Anyway, that is neither here nor there.)
  Think back to the scene when Harvey 
Dent stands in front of hundreds of report-
ers, cops and politicians to respond to a re-
cent wave of crime in Gotham caused by the Joker.
  Using logic and reasoning, Dent attempts 
to assure the crowd that a sound long-term plan would be more prudent than a drastic short-term measure. 
  As Dent is speaking, someone in the 
crowd yells, “Things are worse than ever!” to the delight of much of the audience, which is begging for a quick ﬁ  x — no matter how 
costly it may be — to come to fruition. 
  Well, Will Muschamp has become Gaines-
ville’s version of Dent this season. 
  With fans clamoring for a change — 
you know, because things are worse than ever — Muschamp 
has used (mostly) sound reasoning and logic to combat his antagonists dur-
ing one of the more 
dreadful seasons in 
recent Florida foot-
ball history. 
  Perhaps things are worse than ever. 
  Florida’s offense is last in the Southeast-
ern Conference and 111th in the nation in scoring. Its defense, which was dominant during the ﬁ  rst half of the season, has failed 
to overcome the loss of several critical play-
ers due to injury. 
  Because of that, the Gators sit at 4-6. They 
can’t win the SEC Eastern Division, and it would take something resembling a miracle for them to even become bowl eligible con-sidering they need two wins in their ﬁ  nal two games — one coming against power-house Florida State. 
  But there is hope amid the anguish, and 
it comes in the form of a rapidly developing 
nucleus of young difference-makers on each 
side of the ball.

   Two more Florida runners will 
make the trip to Terre Haute, Ind.
  Even though the women’s cross 
country team failed to secure a 
team bid to this weekend’s NCAA Championships, redshirt junior Cory McGee and redshirt senior 
Agata Strausa picked up at-large 
individual bids for the meet, the NCAA announced Saturday.
  Both McGee and Strausa posted 
top-10 performances at the South Regional Championships Friday and earned All-South Region hon-ors, leading Florida to a fourth-place ﬁ  nish out of 27 teams.
  McGee led the Gators, ﬁ  nishing 
second on the Harry Pritchett Run-ning Course with a time of 20:00.19, which topped her personal-best 6K by 35.46 seconds. Her time was the fastest regionals race by a Gator and the second-fastest 6K in Florida history.
  “That was a huge race for Cory,” 
coach Paul Spangler said. “She came out (Friday) and proved why 
she’s one of the best runners in the 
country.”
  Strausa crossed the line ninth 
out of 194 runners in the meet, ﬁ  nishing 26 spots higher than her 35th-place ﬁ  nish at last year’s South Regional Championships. Her time improved from last year’s regional meet by 44.03 seconds.
  “Every race is just another 
chance to run even better,” Strausa said. “I’m excited to race every race as it comes.”
  This is McGee’s third time and 
Strausa’s second time competing in an NCAA cross country Champi-onship. McGee was the third Gator to ﬁ  nish and 163rd overall in the 
meet as a freshman in 2010.
  Strausa ﬁ  nished 101st when she 
ran in the 2012 NCAA Champion-
ship, completing the 6K course in 20:48.6. Florida ﬁ  nished 23rd out of 31 teams that year.
  The duo will make the trip to the 
Hoosier State with the men’s team, 
which clinched an automatic berth 
into the 2013 NCAA Champion-
ship race after ﬁ  nishing second in 
the South region on Friday.
  Senior Mark Parrish and junior 
Jimmy Clark led the men in Tusca-loosa, Ala., ﬁ  nishing as the top two runners in the 173-competitor ﬁ  eld.
  Parrish ﬁ  nished the 10K race in 
29:44.24. Clark ﬁ  nished just about ﬁ  ve seconds later. Both notched 
personal records.
  “I have been doing well in the 
8K, but I wasn’t sure how it would 
translate this year in 10K,” Parrish said.
  Added Spangler: “Mark threw 
down a move with about a mile and a half to go in the race, and that was a really great move in a difﬁ  -
cult point of the race. … (And) with 
Jimmy ﬁ  nishing second and Florida going one-two — we couldn’t have asked for more.”
  Florida also saw another break-out performance by junior Eddie Garcia. The Jacksonville native ﬁ  n-ished third for the Gators and  ninth overall on Friday, running the 10K in a career-best 30:15.78.
  Parrish, Clark and Garcia earned All-South Region honors at the meet, marking the second time Garcia was awarded the ac-colade and the third time Parrish and Clark were recognized with the honor. 14, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 19, 2013

 Two Gators earn NCAA at-large bidsWOMEN’S BASKETBALL

   Two very different Gators teams 
took the ﬂ  oor last week.
  Florida traveled to face Virginia 
Tech on Thursday intent on out-
rebounding the Hokies.
  UF secured more boards than Vir-
ginia Tech but ultimately lost due to a 
poor offensive showing in the ﬁ  rst half, 
shooting 4 of 24 prior to halftime. 
  “We were really concerned with the 
way they were capable of rebounding the basketball,” coach Amanda Butler 
said. 
“We went out and outrebounded 
them, but there were other areas of 
our game that weren’t quite as tight as 
they needed to be.”
  Through the ﬁ  rst two games of the 
season, Florida showed great balance. 
However, both games were at home, and both opponents were considered 
less than formidable. 
  The Gators failed their ﬁ  rst road 
test, losing 71-59. 
  Three days later, Florida trounced 
Kennesaw State 83-62 on the road. But 
the Gators still managed to get out-rebounded 41-29 by a much smaller 
Owls team. 
  Florida may have a well-balanced 
team, but it does not play like one on a 
nightly basis. 
Consistency is a constant battle for 
any coach to get out of their team, es-pecially for Butler. 
  “That’s been our struggle,” Butler 
said. 
“If we spend a lot of time on one 
thing, we do a great job of handling that, but then there’s another area that lets down. We’ve got to get better 
across the board at having a high level 
of play and a high level of consistency from game to game and even from half to half.”
  Another undesirable UF theme has 
been foul trouble, most notably from freshman Ronni Williams. The for-ward has fouled out in three consecu-tive games. 
  Due to an already shallow bench, 
any foul trouble is magniﬁ  ed due to the small number of replacements. 
  “There’s a change in women’s bas-
ketball this year for everyone,” Butler 
said. “If you watch any game, there are 
probably double the fouls that have 
been called in the past. That’s an ad-justment for everyone. 
“When you take that, compounded 
by being a freshman and making the college adjustment, it’s kind of like a double whammy — I think for all the freshmen right now in the country. Especially players like Ronni, who 
are aggressive, who are capable shot-
blockers, who are going to be playing a lot of minutes.”
  Williams has been racking up fouls, 
but the onus is on the coaches to make in-game adjustments. Despite her foul trouble, Williams is averaging 10 points and 7.8 rebounds per game.
  “Some of it, quite honestly, is just 
going to happen because of the way the game’s being called this year,” Butler said. 
“We’ve got to be smart as coaches 
in getting the kids off the ﬂ  oor and getting them to adjust to the way the crew is calling the game. (We will) help them make adjustments that maybe they aren’t able to recognize on 
their own quite yet.” UF looking for consistency early in season burst onto the scene. 
The freshman cornerback grabbed 
three interceptions in his ﬁ  rst four col-
legiate games and played so well that I anointed him Florida’s best (healthy) 
defensive player after a win against 
Kentucky. 
I stand by that statement today, even 
if Hargreaves has yet to pick off another pass. 
  Recently, other freshmen have 
shown tremendous upside as well. 
  Jarrad Davis, a special teams ace 
for much of the season, recently began 
seeing more time at linebacker for the 
Gators and looks to have the makings of a dependable player for years to come. 
  Even Florida’s much-maligned of-fense is producing talent. 
  Kelvin Taylor rushed for a pair of 
touchdowns in a loss to South Carolina and looks perfectly capable of stuntin’ like his daddy. Ahmad Fulwood has yet to break out the way Taylor has, but if 
he continues to develop, he should be 
another dependable option for several years. 
  Also, I’m unwilling to give up on a 
guy with as much raw talent as Demar-cus Robinson. I ﬁ  rmly believe he will come around. And there are others — Octavius Jackson and Alex Anzalone to name a few. 
  So, despite a downtrodden season, 
there is reason for the Gators to be hope-ful.
  Because as Dent would say, “The 
night is darkest just before the dawn.” TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 19, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 15

Skyler Mornhinweg drops back to pass during Florida’s 19-14 loss to 
South Carolina on Saturday at Williams-Brice Stadium in Columbia, S.C.
Mornhinweg conﬁ  dent after ﬁ  rst start
  “Different injuries are dif-
ferent things,” Muschamp said. 
“Some guys, if you have ankle 
or something, there’s a discom-
fort level with playing and being able to be a productive player. Certainly, this being the throw-
ing shoulder of the quarterback, 
it’s a huge issue with discomfort if he’s not able to do some of the things he wants to do to put enough spin on the ball to be able 
to execute.”
  In the meantime, players like 
Murphy, who waited for their 
chance to come, are tasked with 
bringing the Gators back from 
the brink. Skyler Mornhinweg was the latest.
  The redshirt freshman made 
his ﬁ  rst collegiate start in Co-lumbia, S.C., and nearly quarter-backed Florida to an upset victo-
ry against No. 10 South Carolina. 
But his inability to do much in the passing game handcuffed the Gators’ offense.
  After rushing for 169 yards 
and scoring two touchdowns in the ﬁ  rst half, UF achieved only 31 rushing yards on 19 carries in a scoreless second half.
  Mornhinweg tallied only 107 
yards on 10-of-13 passing and threw a late interception that all but sealed Florida’s fate. Follow-
ing the game, Skyler talked to 
New York Jets offensive coordi-nator Marty Mornhinweg, his father.  “He told me I did an OK job,” 
Skyler said. “Got to take care of the ball better, got to throw the ball away.”
  Moving forward, Mornhin-
weg believes he is capable of more.
  “I’m conﬁ  dent in my abilities, 
and I’m conﬁ  dent in the coaches’ 
game plan,” Mornhinweg said. 
“Whatever they want to run out there, we’ll execute it.”
  Murphy offered his support 
for Mornhinweg, saying the Phil-
adelphia native “did a good job 
with the pass plays that he was given.”
  “Being in the atmosphere like 
that, I thought he really handled himself well,” Murphy contin-ued. “He’s just got to continue to develop and work hard.” FOOTBALL , 
from page 13PHIL , from page 13Taylor emerging for GatorsWilbekin remains suspended
  Scottie Wilbekin, the Gators starting point 
guard last year, was suspended indeﬁ  nitely for 
violating team rules June 10, leaving Hill as the only other true point guard on the roster.
  Despite the injury to his only remaining 
point guard, Donovan said Wilbekin will not be reinstated for Florida’s matchup against Middle Tennessee on Thursday.
  Instead, Donovan will look to play bigger 
by having Dorian Finney-Smith play more minute, some coming as the team’s point guard.
E  ven before Hill’s injury, Florida’s offense 
was different than in previous games. Casey 
Prather, who entered tonight’s game averag-
ing 22.3 points per game, had only 10 on 2-of-10 shooting. The senior forward consistently got to the foul line, going 6 of 7 from the char-ity stripe.
  Prather contributed in other ways, leading 
the team with nine rebounds and four assists.  Patric Young was UF’s leading scorer with 
12 points, but Donovan still said he saw some problems with the center’s offensive capabili-ties.
  “We got him the ball in some really good 
areas, and he kept getting it and holding it,” Donovan said. “And after two or three seconds, he was getting trapped. He allowed himself, in my opinion, to get trapped way too much in the game. He didn’t need to be trapped that much.”
  In addition to losing  Hill, Florida will be 
without sophomore Dillon Graham for the rest of the season. Graham will redshirt after being ruled out for the year because of bone spurs in his hips. His recovery is expected to take about four months. HOOPS , from page 13

opinion, to get trapped way too much in

  When Florida traveled to Mis-
souri on Oct. 20, it was in the midst 
of one of the best stretches of volley-ball in the program’s history. 
  UF swept nine straight matches 
from Sept. 17 to Oct. 13, which in-cluded No. 17 Kentucky and No. 22 Florida State. 
  But that dominance has leveled 
off since the No. 5 Gators lost to the No. 7 Tigers in four sets in Colum-bia, Mo.  Since the two teams’ ﬁ  rst matchup, Florida dropped a set against LSU, needed ﬁ  ve sets to beat Texas A&M and were most recently swept by the Tigers on Friday night.
  “Anytime when you lose, you 
step back,” coach Mary Wise said. 
“I think in some areas we’ve proved 
from [the ﬁ  rst loss to Mizzou] that Missouri was able to exploit some things that we can direct our atten-tion on and we’ve gotten better from it.
  “When you play a team as talent-
ed as Missouri and well-coached as Missouri, there are plenty of teach-able moments.”
  Barring a col-
lapse by Mis-souri, which is one of only two undefeated teams remaining in the 
nation, the Ti-
gers will secure a Southeastern 
Conference title with a win against Mississippi State on Friday. 
  Although it may seem as though 
the Tigers dominated the Gators in their sweep, each set came down to the ﬁ  nal few points. Florida scored at least 22 points in each set.
  The focus for the Gators now 
turns from winning an SEC title to trying to capture the program’s ﬁ  rst national title. While a regular season title is out of the question, the pos-sibility of getting a top seed in the 
NCAA Tournament is still possible.
  Wise’s squad is currently sixth 
in match win-loss percentage in 
the nation at .889. Securing a top seed would assure that Gainesville would be one of the host cities for the ﬁ  rst and second rounds of the tournament. 
  There are three games remain-ing on Florida’s schedule — an away match against Tennessee on Wednesday, UF’s ﬁ  nal home match on Friday against LSU and the regu-lar season ﬁ  nale against Kentucky on Nov. 27. 
   “We now look at it that with the 
SEC championship no longer a pos-sibility, it’s now about the big prize,” Wise said.  
“We know this: The way it is in 
college athletics, you are not judged on your body of work for three months.  In the end, you’re judged on your work over a three-weekend tournament.”   MICHELLE PROVENZANO

  Annie Speese knew what the Gators 
needed — and she responded.
  Without midﬁ  elder Havana Solaun, 
who suffered a torn ACL during the 
Southeastern Conference Tournament ﬁ  nal, Florida was in need of an offen-sive spark against Jacksonville in the 
ﬁ  rst round of the NCAA Tournament 
on Saturday. 
Speese delivered.  The junior midﬁ  elder crossed in 
a corner kick in the 57th minute and 
found freshman midﬁ  elder Meggie 
Dougherty Howard, who tapped in the pass for a goal en route to a 2-0 Gators victory. 
With   Solaun, who was second on 
Florida with eight goals prior to her in-jury, is out for the remainder of the sea-son, Speese is working to ﬁ  ll the void.
  “She is really trying hard to play 
with Havana in mind,” coach Becky Burleigh said. “One of the things she has deﬁ  nitely increased is her shot pro-duction. She’s deﬁ  nitely taking that to heart, especially with Havana being out 
of the lineup. She had some great op-
portunities on Saturday.”
  Speese took six shots during the 
game. She barely missed scoring a goal 
of her own when she deﬂ  ected a shot 
off the post.
  Her six shots were the most she has 
taken in a match since Florida’s 1-1 
draw with South Florida on Sept. 15.
  “Because we’re such a possession-
oriented team, we always think, ‘One 
more pass, one more pass,’” Burleigh said. “We need to think sometimes, ‘Let’s take a shot.’ I just think that em-phasis for all of our attackers is a good thing.”
  As Florida heads on the road to face 
Duke in second-round play on Friday in Durham, N.C., that mindset will be critical.
  Although Duke has a 9-8-5 record 
this season, Burleigh said her team can-not afford to overlook the Blue Devils or that their season could end.
  “It seems like every single time we 
play [Duke] it’s a competitive match,” she said.
  With the Gators looking for a more 
potent attack to advance in NCAA 
play, Speese is one of Florida’s starters 
that can make a difference.
  “We talk about our purpose a lot,” 
Speese said Sunday after the game. “When we had our meeting a while 
ago, we talked about what we need 
from each other. 
  “[Taking shots] was one of the things 
that a lot of my teammates told me they 
needed me to do more of, so I’ve just 
been trying to shoot a lot more.” 16, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 19, 2013
