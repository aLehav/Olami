Man dies
in diving
accident
By KATHERINE BEIN
Alligator Staff Writer
kbein@alligator org
A 58-year-old man died while cave
diving at Ginnie Springs in an area
known as the Devil's Eye on Friday.
According to a Gilchrist County Sher-
iff's report, the diver and his partner,
Gary Hildman, were exploring an area in
Devil's Eye called Henry's Crack when
they separated.
Hildman breached the surface but
didn't see his partner, according to the
report.
Hildman notified police at about 12:50
p.m. when the man hadn't surfaced as ex-
pected. His body was recovered at about
4:26 p.m.
The body was then transported to the
Medical Examiner's Office in Gainesville
to determine cause of death, according to
the report.
The man's name and further details
are being withheld until notification of
r his next of kin.
Since 1960, there
have been more than
431 deaths as a result
of inexperienced div-
ers pushing themselves
beyond their training,
Green according to the cave
diving branch of the
National Speleological Society Web site.
Larry Green, a professional cave-div-
ing instructor with more than 25 years
of experience, said most diving fatalities
occur because divers go "too far, too fast,
too soon."
He said many divers get over-excited
about exploring and fail to watch out for
things like air management or keeping a
straight sight on open waters.
Green added that those experienced
in open water diving should also keep in
mind that cave diving is a totally differ-
ent sport.

UF employee banned for behavior
0 POLICE TOOK HIM TO
SHANDS UNDER THE
BAKER ACT.

tstewart@a Iigator org
A UF Academic Advising
Center employee has been placed
on leave and banned from cam-
pus after strange behavior that
scared his co-workers, according
to the University Police Depart-ment.
Gregory J. Champion, 23, re-
portedly began acting strangely
at work in early August after re-
turning from vacation.
On Aug. 20, the day after he
was placed on paid leave, of-
ficers responded to the Beer Pit
on West University Avenue be-
cause Champion was reportedly
sending strange e-mails and text
messages to employees from that
location.
The e-mails stated that an-
other employee wanted to hurthimself.
Officers determined that
Champion was apparently pro-
jecting his issues onto the em-
ployee and noted a possible men-
tal illness.
Earlier in the
On day, according to
Campus the police report,
Champion made a
comment to his roommate's girl-
friend stating, "If I wanted to, I
would be raping you right now."
The roommate is an employee
of the advising center, accordingto the report.
After speaking to Champion
outside the Beer Pit, officers de-
cided to take him to the Shands
at UF emergency room, under
the Baker Act.
On the way, officers stopped
and placed ankle restraints on
him after he began kicking in
the back seat, according to the
report.
According to UPD, he was
banned from campus Aug. 31
and his future employment at UF
is being discussed.

51 removed from stadium during game
Fifty-one people were arrested or re-
moved from Ben Hill Griffin Stadium during
Saturday's game against Charleston Southern
University, according to a University Police
Department press release.
Of the 15 arrests, four were UF students.
The most common infraction was posses-
sion of alcohol, which resulted in 13 arrests
and one ejection.Ten people were ejected for intoxication
and nine people were ejected for sitting in the
wrong section of the stadium.
There was one arrest for battery.
Saturday's game provided the first test of
the stadium's new no-smoking policy. Pre-
viously, the stadium provided smoking sec-
tions.
No one was arrested or ejected due tosmoking.
The game was the first to see a full-scale
rollout of the text-messaging system that al-
lows fans to text problems to police. Toward
the end of the game, 88 texts had been re-
ceived.
Many of the texts involved alcohol viola-
tions and intoxicated fans, according to UPD.

Student groups set up 2,977 flags to honor victims
E THE PROJECT WILL BE ON
DISPLAY UNTIL SATURDAY.
By NICOLE GREINER
Alligator Contributing Writer
Today, 2,977 flags stand on the
Plaza of the Americas, each rep-
resenting a life lost in the Sept. 11
attacks.
The 9/11: Never Forget Proj-
ect, created by the Young Ameri-
ca's Foundation, encouraged stu-
dents nationwide to hold a vigil
commemorating the event.
The Network of Enlightened
Women is sponsoring UF's proj-
ect with help from the College
Republicans and Americans for
Prosperity.
Members spent Labor Day as-
sembling the flags, which will
stand until Saturday.
Project coordinator Jean Mor-
row, a political science and edu-
cation senior, said the flags were
donated from organizations in
Alachua and Citrus counties.
She said some of the primary
contributors were the American
Legion Auxiliary of Crystal River
and the American Legion of Ala-
chua County.
Morrow said she got the ideafrom the Young America's Foun-
dation Web site, which suggested
the display of 2,977 flags and a
moment of silence.On Friday, the project will
close its week of remembrance
with a vigil to honor those who
died. The vigil will be held on thePlaza of the Americas at 7 p.m.
Plans are being made for Fri-
day's vigil, Morrow said, add-
ing that members of Carillons, a
narrison uiamona / Aiigator Man
Small flags commemorating the upcoming anniversary of the Sept. 11 Attacks stand on the Plaza of
the Americas on Monday. The flags were placed as part of the 9/11: Never Forget Project, which will be
on display until Saturday.group of UF students who play
the Centruy Tower bells, will play
"In Memoriam," a song written
for the victims of 9/11.
Morrow said although stu-
"We've moved on and car-
ried on, but we can't forget
the individuals who lost
their lives."
Jean Morrow
project coordinator
dents worry about day-to-day
activities, like tests and papers,
they should take time this week
to remember who died in the at-
tacks.
"We've moved on and carried
on, but we can't forget the indi-
viduals who lost their lives," she
said.
Throughout the week, project
members will remind students
of the 2001 tragedy by handing
out pins reading, "9/11: Never
Forget," and posters displaying
images of the Sept. 11 attacks and
other acts of terrorism.
"I feel like it is a fitting tribute
for all 2,977 casualties," said Jef-
frey Ivey, a political science ju-
nior and president of Americans

STUDENT GOVERNMENT
SG political parties to finish slating interviews today
By CAROLYN TILLO
Alligator Writer
Student Government's political parties
continued their search for Senate candi-
dates Friday in the Reitz Union.
During the first two days of interviews,
91 students committed to the Unite Party,
34 committed to the Orange and Blue Party
and between 25 and 30 have committed to
the Progress Party.
Yang Zhang, a Chinese and marketing
junior, said she planned to slate with the
Unite Party because she likes the party's
ideas for improving student life, including
motion-sensor lighting and 24-hour librar-
ies.
At 3 p.m., while she was filling out herqualifying form that would allow her to
interview, the Reitz Union fire alarm went
off.
Zhang said with a laugh that she asked
herself, "Should I finish filling this out and
risk my life?"
After about 20 minutes, the fire alarm
ended and Zhang filed back inside with SG
officials.
Jason Yoepp, Unite Party spokesman,
said Friday was not as busy as Thursday,
but he expects a large turnout Tuesday.
Orange and Blue Sen. Ben Cavataro said
he believed Tuesday's turnout would be
twice as large because students would have
time to tell their friends during the long
weekend.
"Tuesday is going to be chaotic, but cha-"Overall, it seems like everyone is

otic in a good way," he said.
Yan Xie, a sophomore, said he chose the
Orange and Blue Party because he feels the
party's officials will listen to his opinions.
Nick Mildebrath, campaign manager for
the Progress Party, said his party is focus-
ing on what it can do for students rather
than criticizing other parties.Mildebrath said the Progress Party has
seen a wide variety of qualified candi-
dates.
"It seems like our goal of bringing out a
lot of people who weren't involved in SG
but have been involved in other things on
campus has been a success," he said.
Nathan Dolorfino, a sophomore, said he
had not decided which party to choose on
Friday.
He said he wanted to research legislation
passed by the parties over the weekend.
"Overall, it seems like everyone is try-
ing to do something best, but, when you
get government, government in itself has
its own inherited inefficiencies," he said.
Slating will continue today in Room 284
of the Reitz Union.
Local Lutheran churches react to controversial doctrine
0 THE CHURCH VOTED TO
INCLUDE GAY CLERGY.
By JOHN J. BOOTHE
Alligator Contributing Writer
The Evangelical Lutheran
Church in America, the nation's
largest Lutheran denomination,
voted for the inclusion of openly
gay clergy in committed relation-
ships into their congregations
Aug. 21.
In the weeks following, ELCA
churches have been faced with the
decision of adopting the new doc-
trine or splitting away from the de-
nomination.Reverend Michael L. Collins, of
University Lutheran in Gainesville,
said his congregation is not consid-
ering a split.
"This congregation itself is a
very open-minded congregation,"
Collins said. "We have gay and
lesbian people who worship here
and are in leadership positions as
well."
Collins believes the decision
came down to an issue of justice
and fairness concerning homosex-
uality in the Christian faith.
But a half-mile north of Univer-
sity Lutheran sits the First Luther-
an Church of Gainesville, led by
the Rev. John Roth, where the de-
nominational allegiance is with theLutheran Church-Missouri Synod,
a doctrine described as conserva-
tive to the ELCA's more liberal
tendencies.
Along withbans against women
in the clergy, First Lutheran does
not allow gay men
National in the clergy, re-
News gardless of wheth-
er they are celibate.
The main argument against ho-
mosexuals boils down to scripture,
according to Roth.
"Every passage in the Bible of
sexuality outside the bounds of
marriage between a man and a
woman is not seen in a positive
light," Roth said.
Collins believes that any refer-ence concerning it as a sin is a mis-
representation of the scripture.
For churches that implement
the new doctrine, like University
Lutheran, working with other
branches of Lutheran churches
might become strained as they
continue to drift apart on scripture
perception.
UF's Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual
and Transgender Affairs office
hopes for continued progress on
this front. Director Andrea Stokes
said her office has been trying to
find a way to support students
who struggle with religion and ho-
mosexuality.
Roth said the true message of
Christianity is acceptance no mat-ter what the issue, and then God
will spark a change within the in-
dividual.
"You've got to ask, 'what is the
gospel? Is it merely accepting peo-
ple how they are, or does it include
the growth and transformation of
people to how God wants them to
be?' Roth said.
He stressed his church's views
on sharing the message of Jesus
with anyone regardless of how he
or she lives.
"I know how things can be tak-
en and I don't want to demonize
anyone," Roth said. "I don't want
to slam the door on an opportunity
to share Jesus Christ with some-
one."

Magician performs

By ALISON SCHWARTZ
Alligator Contributing Writer
Magician Jason "Escape" Gardner won't be pulling
bunnies out of his hat during his performance tonight at
the Orange and Brew.
Instead, he will squirm out of a straight jacket and send
an entranced audience member back in time to the 1800s.
"Every show has to be unique," said Escape, 39, who
lives in Boston. "I'm always changing it up
On and keeping it exciting, for myself and theCampus audience."
Escape, who was scheduled to perform by
Reitz Union Board Entertainment, said he uses about 11 to
12 volunteers per performance.
Escape said he recognizes a change in audience expec-
tations from the days of Harry Houdini.
"You can't just rely on doing a trick anymore," he said.
"People require more input, personality and interaction.
It's not enough just to hang upside-down."

About 40 gather to protest Chavez
By LEORA ARNOWITZ
Alligator Contributing Writer
About 40 people gathered Friday
with a simple message: "No more
Chivez."
Protesters spoke out against the
Venezuelan president and chanted,
"We want peace" and "No more op-
pression" in heat nearing 90 degrees
at West University Avenue and 13th
Street.
What started with two students
and a lone sign that read "No +
Chavez" slowlybecame a full-blown
protest demonstrating against Hugo
Chvez's rule over Venezuela.
Though it was scheduled for
5 p.m., the protest took full force
around 5:45 p.m. as demonstrators,
mostly students, trickled to the cor-ner.
"We're Venezuelan -we're
always a little late," joked Esther
Benchimol, a fifth-year industrial
and systems engineering student.
Word of the protest was spread
via Facebook, text messages and
Blackberry messages.
Francia Salazar, a sophomore
and one of the first to arrive, heard
of the demonstration in a text from
a friend.
"I felt it was important to come
because it's necessary for the whole
world to know that there are many
Venezuelans who are against
Chivez," Salazar said.
Not only Venezuelans attended
the protest. About 10 Honduran
students held signs and chanted in
favor of democracy.
Kenya Perez, a Honduran juniorat Santa Fe College, said she felt
inclined to protest because she is
against communism in Latin Amer-
ica.
"We want peace," Perez said.
"And we hate Chivez."
Despite the serious message be-
hind the gathering, the protesters
seemed to enjoy the get together.
Breaks for cigarettes, group photos
and trips to the nearby Kangaroo
gas station were frequent.
Andres Carvallo, UF alumnus
and co-organizer of the event, said
he felt the protest achieved its goal.
"We wanted to make Americans
here in Gainesville aware of what's
going on in Venezuela and how
Chivez is trying to oppress the peo-
ple," he said. "This is just our way to
help out and show support for our
family down there in Venezuela."
DIVER, from page 1
Often, he said, open-water div-
ers may want to explore a cave or
wreck and then become confused
when they go beyond the reach
of natural light or stir up bottom
dirt, loosing visibility.
There are plenty of places in
the Gainesville area to receive
training.
The National Association for
Cave Diving, which formed as a
result of analyzing accident re-
ports, originated in Gainesville.
They've been training divers at
their local facility since 1968,
Green said."I'd advise anyone interested
in cave diving to seek out an ex-
perienced diver to teach you the
proper techniques," Green said.

Release of photo in
citizens' best interest
A few days ago, the Associated Press decided to publish a
photo despite Secretary of Defense Robert Gates' stron-
gest urging to reconsider.
The photo, which accompanied a story that detailed the final
moments of Lance Cpl. Joshua M. Bernard's life, showed Ber-
nard lying mortally wounded in Southern Afghanistan. Gates
objected to the transmission of the photo, claiming it was disre-
spectful to the family of the deceased.
Gates might have been looking out for the best interests of
Bernard's family, but he was not looking out for the best inter-
ests of the American people. The duty of the Associated Press,
and of any press, is to account for what is happening on the
globe.
We aren't parents, but we can understand the anguish the
photo caused Bernard's family. We mean, one of our moms
burst into tears the first time she saw the Pieta. However, the
publication of the photo serves the greater good by providing a
visceral, unadulterated glimpse into the consequences of war.
The Editorial Board of the AP decided to publish the photo
after deliberating about Gates' request. They said that the image
was "a part of the history of the war" and that it merited publi-
cation, according to an Associated Press article.
To say that it merited publication is an understatement. The
image of Bernard is one of the most poignant images to come
out of the war in Afghanistan. The photo is a necessary compli-
ment to what is the closest imitation an AP writer will do of
Tim O'Brien, ever. Since when do AP articles start off with "The
pomegranate bush looked ominous?"
The Editorial Board of the AP made the right decision to
ignore the requests of Robert Gates and uphold their motto
of "capturing the consequences of government action or inac-
hion."
Feckless Faith
Pastor Randy Meadowsof Louisville's City of
Refuge Church so be-
lieves in the power of God
to transform individuals that
he's willing to use the welfare
of children as collateral.
Mark Hourigan, who was
found guilty of sexually abus-
ing an 11-year-old in 1998, is
scheduled to become an or-
dained minister at Meadow's
church. Meadows claims that
Hourigan deserves forgive-
ness and that society should
look past his previous crimes
because "the Lordhas touched
his heart."
We can't think of any fur-
ther lengths that one could go
to to prove a point. As far as
gambling is concerned, this
is crazier than Christopher
Walken playing Russian Rou-
lette at the end of the "The
Deer Hunter."
Meadows already admits
that Hourigan wasn't open
about his past until he wasconfronted. If he was ready
and willing to be ordained
based on false pretenses about
his past life, why would any-
one think he would be open
and up-front about anything
else? If he was so set on re-
penting, why wasn't he open-
ly asking for forgiveness?
If someone tried to pitch
"Kindergarten Cop" as a
heartwarming comedy with
Arnold Schwarzenegger as a
convicted child molester get-
ting a "second chance at life,"
the answer would immediate-
ly be "no." The idea to let this
play out in real life should not
be green-lighted, either.
The plan to ordain Hourig-
an stems from letting faith, as
well as the desire to be right,
distort rational thinking. If
Meadows wants to prove the
power of his faith, he could
do it in a number of ways that
don't allow a registered sex
offender any authority over a
group of children.

Late author reminds us to be patient
ept. 12 will be the first anniversary of the death ofDavid Foster Wallace.
Wallace, who hanged himself last year at the
age of 46 after a decades-long battle with depression, is
generally considered to be among the most influential
writers in recent memory. His essays covered a diverse
range of topics -from the AVN Awards to the Maine
Lobster Festival -and his fiction often dealt with find-
ing meaning and authenticity in a world saturated with
advertising, irony and loneliness.
One of his trademarks, if it can be called that, was his
voluminous output. His essays' word counts often ran
into the thousands -and that doesn't include the text in
the dozens of footnotes Wallace would deploy through-
out much of his writing. The novel for which he is best
known, "Infinite Jest," is a sprawling, three-pound co-
lossus of 1,079 pages (including 388 endnotes).
And that makes Wallace seem like an anachronism in
today's world -though an appreciated and necessary
anachronism.
This is, after all, a time when the primary means of
keeping in touch for many people involves answering
the question "What are you doing?" in 140 characters or
fewer. Phone conversations are perfunctory and brief,
reduced to short, two-minute powwow sessions while
you're on the bus -that is, if you don't just send a text
message and call it done. Print journalists are told to
trim copy down, to simplify their reporting rather than
contextualize, and to make sure there's a cute, snappy
lede -all so that some guy on the Internet can leave
a terse "TL;DR" comment on the online version of the
article.
It's chic in an elitist sort of way to look at all this
and say that Twitter is dumbing down our culture, or
that we're becoming a society of illiterates. But I don't
think that's true -we're not becoming less intelli-gent, but I do think we're becom-
ing less patient when it comes to
self-expression, both our own and
others'. And that's one of the worst
byproducts of our instant gratifica-
__ _ _ tion culture.
Joe Dellosa It's true that Wallace asked his
letters@allgatororg readers for a lot of their time. All
his footnotes and occasional logor-
rhea, though, don't come across as
literary masturbation but rather as an earnest, almost
desperate attempt to share very complicated ideas and
emotions with whoever might need them. And, as it
turns out, plenty of people did -in the wake of Wal-
lace's suicide, some of the most poignant tributes to
Wallace came from people who said his writing helped
them feel less alone as they struggled with their own
thoughts of suicide, and they were utterly crushed
when they learned that someone who helped them pull
through couldn't do the same.
In a lot of ways, I feel out of place talking about this.
I'm as guilty of being a part of our instant gratification
culture as anybody else. In fact, when the popular Infi-
niteSummer.org online reading community got started
in June as a sort of support system among thousands
who had never actually finished the book, I gave up af-
ter Week 2.
But if nothing else, Wallace's writing has taught me
one thing: Even in an era when time is so intensely com-
modified, taking more than a few moments to share
something that's important to you is still an act of love.
And it's an act of love that's matched only by listening
when someone does share.
R.I.P., David Foster Wallace. You are loved.

UF should keep cheap food options
It is understandable that, in the heat of national de-
bates over health care, CIA interrogations and the way
forward from a crimson summer in Afghanistan, we
have not talked enough about the recent facelift of the
Reitz Union food court.
Though the greasy calzones, chewy pasta and "fuh-
gidabowdit" attitude of Capeesh will be missed, surely
the most grievous injury to our campus cuisine is the
elimination of Wendy's Old Fashioned Hamburgers. An
alternate hamburger hawker, Cheeburger Cheeburger
Express, now stands in shoes it could not possibly hope
to fill.
Despite my initial pledge to boycott Cheeburger, I
caved in to the twin evils of proximity and hunger and
sampled the chain's menu a few days ago. I had their
"classic" combination meal which included a 5.5-ounce
cheeseburger, French fries and a soft drink. The ham-
burger was passable, and I appreciated that there were a
number of options of cheese and other toppings. At that,
dear reader, my praise ends.
My meal -the smallest available -carried an $8
price tag. Should the university not be providing more
affordable options to students as our Bright Futures dim
and economic hardship stalks the land?
These prices are exorbitant compared to other fast-
food offerings. The Angus 1/3 pound hamburger meal
from McDonald's is nearly two dollars less and includes
a larger portion of French fries and unlimited beverageZach Mayo refills. Perhaps the biggest hole
Spea king Out in my heart is shaped like that
miracle of the fast-food world: the
Wendy's baked potato. This satis-
fying menu item was always an affordable and delectable
choice. The financial viability of grabbing a bite to eat on
campus has not suffered such a dire blow since Burger
King's dual monarchy fell and the Racquet Club location
was replaced with the pricey Chili's Too.
I have mentioned these objections to a handful of Chee-
burger defenders and they have, without fail, brought up
the milkshakes. They may well be quite extraordinary. I
will never know, however, because they cost about five
dollars for a small cup. I have no problem believing that
my milkshake is made with genuine Edy's ice cream if I
could buy a half gallon of Edy's for the same price. Give
me a large Frosty and three dollars in change any day.
In short, a hamburger ordered and received within the
span of two minutes is a part of the American cultural
fabric -but it can only be so good. There is a Styrofoam
ceiling which all of the Angus beef and provolone cheese
in the world cannot shatter. It seems, however, that prices
are nigh limitless. Gators have a taste for the finer things
in life, but let us unite to save the few extra value menus
left on campus. If we do not, it is only a matter of time un-
til we are bringing mustard sandwiches for lunch and eat-
ing them in front of a new Stonewood Tavern Express.

Guest column
Law not intended to
protect SG records
ver the past couple of days we have heard sev-
eral Student Government officials praise the new
"transparency policy" being created through Fam-
ily Educational Rights and Privacy Act waivers. This new
policy should not be lauded as progress towards creat-
ing an open government, but rather as a cheap ploy by
higher-ups at the university.
FERPA is a federal law that allows students to view
their educational record and have some discretion as to
how and to whom their personal and academic informa-
tion is disclosed. The law is designed to prevent profes-
sors from posting grades in public places and universi-
ties from releasing our academic records to third parties
without our consent. FERPA is not meant to hamstring
the student body's right to know what is happening with
Activity and Service Fees or to put a veil over what the
Student Body president is doing in his publicly elected
position.
From 1974 -the year FERPA was enacted by Congress
-to last week, nearly every record relating to SG had
been open for public inspection. These records remain
open for inspection at other SG associations in Florida.
For nearly 35 years, transparency and the public's ability
to inspect SG records was the status quo. This past week,
it suddenly became non-existent.
With the creation of this new transparency waiver, the
university is claiming SG budgets, allocation requests,
Supreme Court decisions, Student Senate minutes and a
host of other records are suddenly protected from public
inspection by FERPA. Last week -and for the past 35
years -many of the documents described in the waiver
were available to the public and did not fall under the
purview of FERPA.
Did the meaning of a FERPA-protected document
change in the last week? No. Either the university, and
every other state university in Florida, has been violating
FERPA for the past 35 years, or this waiver was created
for some other dubious reason.
If the university has been releasing FERPA-protected
documents for 35 years, why hasn't the Department of
Education cut off federal funding to UF and every other
Florida university, as prescribed by FERPA? Why hasn't
any secretary of education in the past 35 years issued a
cease-and-desist order to the entire State University Sys-
tem? And why hasn't there been a single complaint filed
against any Florida university for releasing SG docu-
ments?
Students at UF are losing their ability to know what is
going on in SG and where their $14 million in Activity and
Service Fees are going. It is time to face the facts: The uni-
versity is attempting to relieve itself of its responsibility
to allow the public to know what is happening with our
tax dollars and student tuition. What we are dealing with
here is a total lack of respect for the law, and a total lack of
respect for the students of this great university.

Florida debuts
hurry-up offense
0 DOE, JENKINS EXPECTED TO PLAY VS. TROY.
By MIKE DIFERDINANDO
Alligator Staff Writer
mdiferdina ndo@alligator org
Florida took a page out the Oklahoma playbook and un-
veiled its new hurry-up offense in Saturday's 62-3 win over
Charleston Southern.
Coach Urban Meyer and defensive coordinator Charlie
Strong had such a tough time game-planning for the Sooners'
fast-paced offense in last season's national title game that they
installed their own version in the Gators' offense.
"I want to hear what gives them a hard time, and that prep-
aration we had for Oklahoma was very difficult," Meyer said.
"Go up and snap the ball. Put pressure on the defense. You're
going to see more and more of the up-tempo."
In UF's new "Bonsai" formation, there is no huddle.
Instead, the players run to the line of scrimmage, Tim
Tebow gets the play called in from the sideline and then snaps
the ball at varying points in the play clock to keep the defense
off balance.
"What you saw Saturday was the tip of the iceberg," Meyer
said.
Receiver David Nelson estimated that the Gators scored
two or three times out of the formation, including Jeff Demps'
23-yard touchdown run.
THOMPSON MAKING UP: Deonte Thompson didn't have a catch
Saturday.
He blew by two Buccaneers defenders on a fly route but

"That just goes to show his work ethic and his determina-
tion to want to be that big-time receiver, which he's going to DOE, JENKINS SHOULD PLAY: Linebacker Dustin Doe and cor-"tbe.
First look backs up preseason hype
en minutes after the clock ranout on Florida's 62-3 win over
Charleston Southern, the CSU
players gathered at midfield.
They huddled around coach Jay Mills
in a perfect semicircle. Those in the front
row took a knee, while the rest stood.
It looked like the typical lineup for a
team photo, and if things keep going the
way the Gators expect them to this sea-
son, the Buccaneers will want to keep a
memento.
The game's outcome was never a ques-
tion. It was little more than a scrimmage
before the season heats up, but it was the
first peek under the hood, and the perfor-
mance backed up what had previously
been just talk.
Riley Cooper is ready to step into the
spotlight. The three-headed monster at
running back is in top form. And Will
Hill is here to stay.Mike McCall

mmccall@alligator orgCooper made
five catches for
105 yards, nearly
half his total yard-
age from last sea-
son-including a
68-yarder on the
Gators' third of-
fensive play.
He threw tough
blocks, ran crisp
routes and dis-
played sure hands, making his decision
to put off a career in baseball until after
the season look all the more important.
"Riley played like he practiced," coach
Urban Meyer said. "He's playing as good
as he has ever played."
And he looked like a go-to receiver,
perhaps more so in light of drops by
Deonte Thompson and Brandon James,

Gators edge Cardinal, win
Community Bankers Classic
By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
a berry@a lIigator org
Before departing for California, UF
coach Mary Wise said her team's back-to-
back matches this weekend would provide
a challenge similar to what the Gators will
face in the NCAA Tournament.
If that's the case, it seems the Gators
will be in good shape come December.
No. 4 Florida won the Community
Bankers Classic by defeating Pacific 3-1
(25-14, 20-25, 25-19, 25-21) Saturday night
in Stockton, Calif.
UF (5-0) reached the championship
match against Pacific (4-1) after edging No.
10 Stanford 3-2 (25-20, 15-25, 16-25, 27-25,
15-9) in a five-set thriller Friday night.
The Cardinal (3-2) knocked the Gators
out of the NCAA Tournament last year,
but Florida proved to be resilient enoughto outlast its opponent this year despite
terrible performances in the second and
third sets, in which the Gators hit .094 and
.000, respectively.
After Saturday's
match, Wise was pleased
with her team's overall
performance in the tour-
nament -particularly
its ability to repeatedly
bounce back -but still
saw room for improve-
ment.
"These were two
back-to-back, grind-it-out matches in this
tournament that exposed weaknesses in
areas where we can get better," Wise said.
The Gators dominated the Tigers in the
first set Saturday, putting up a .500 hitting
percentage while their opponent recorded
an equal number of kills and hitting er-

But the teams split the next two sets, and
Florida took a 2-1 advantage into the fourth
frame hoping to avoid a third-straight five-
set match. That seemed like an unlikely pos-
sibility throughout the set, but with the teams
tied at 20, the Gators scored three straight
and eventually closed out the match with a
kill by Colleen Ward.
Ward was Florida's leader in kills in both
matches, putting up 15 against the Tigers and
16 against the Cardinal.
Although Ward was impressive at the net
all weekend, senior libero Elyse Cusack was
named MVP of the tournament. Cusack re-
corded a match-high 16 digs Saturday, giv-
ing her 1,713 for her career and moving her
into the top five for career digs in Southeast-but Cusack wins MVP
ern Conference history.
"She really understands the game well,
and that's where a lot of her digs come from,"
associate head coach Nick Cheronis said.
"Generally speaking, we draw up defensive
schemes to get the ball to Elyse because we
know she'll be able to read it and dig them."
After posting her seventh career triple-
double Friday against Stan-
ford, sophomore setter Kelly
Murphy put up another dou-

Gators lose thriller, blowout during weekend road trip
By EUGENIO TORRENS

The UF soccer team hit a patch of turbu-
lence this weekend on its travels to Blooming-
ton, Ind., and Champaign, Ill.
The No. 6 Gators (3-2-0) dropped a double-
overtime 2-1 decision to Indiana on Friday.
They followed it up with a 3-0 loss to UCLA
on Sunday in Champaign.
The Gators didn't have a single shot on
goal against the Hoosiers, scoring on an In-
diana own goal. UF improved that number
to three on Sunday. The Bruins had 22 shots,including 12 on goal.
"UCLA did not sit it, they put us under
pressure," UF coach Becky Burleigh said. "I
thought they got the better physical part of the
game.",
In the first half of Sunday's game, the Bru-
ins bent but couldn't break the Gators defense.
Katie Fraine was instrumental in keeping UF
in the game with five saves in the first half.
Momentum seemed to swing for the Gators
when they attacked the Bruins goal twice
in a span of two minutes, but UCLA keeper
Chante' Sandiford was there both times.
"UCLA was so fast and stuff, the coaches
-I remember everyone was saying 'If youhave a shot on goal, take it,"' senior Lauren
Hyde said.
If the Gators were riding high on confi-
dence at the end of the first
half, the Bruins quickly
ended that with Sydney Le-
roux's 51st-minute goal on
a pass through the middle
from Kristina Larsen.
"In the first half, I
thought we played really
Hyde well," Hyde said. "We gota few chances, but second
half we kind of fell apart after the goal. We're
going to get scored on, we just have to learnhow to play when we're down a goal."
Larsen widened the gap with a goal of
her own, which was initially deflected by the
Gators defense.
Despite trailing 2-0, UF struggled offensive-
ly as UCLA never stopped attacking. Bruins
senior Kara Lang knocked in the back-break-
ing third goal on a free kick that ricocheted off
the cross bar and landed behind the goal line.
"We have to look at our team's perfor-
mance, which this weekend exposed some
things about us, which is exactly why we play
games like this in order for us to get better
by the time the SEC and the postseason rolls
around," Burleigh said.

which would have resulted in touchdowns.
Those drops reduced quarterback Tim Tebow's stats
from ridiculous to very efficient: 10-of-15 for 188 yards
and a touchdown. Tebow wasn't asked to do much,
running just twice for one yard with a second-quarter
scoring plunge, and he didn't have to.
Jeff Demps, Chris Rainey and Emmanuel Moody
had the ground game covered.
Demps led the way with 89 yards and two TDs on
five carries, picking up right where he left off in his
breakout freshman season.
"That kid is unbelievable," receiver David Nelson
said. "The way it used to be here, when we call a run
play, as a receiver you block trying to get the first down.
Now, your block could make a touchdown."
Rainey touched the football just once, and he made
the most of the opportunity with a zig-zagging 76-yard
scamper. As Rainey neared the goal line, he peeked at
the new video board above the south end zone stands
to see the defender trailing him, choosing just the right
moment to dive in for a score.
Moody displayed a different style en route to his 86
yards on nine carries. He plowed through defenders,breaking seven tackles on one third-quarter run.
Little could be inferred from the Gators' perfor-
mance on defense, and the lineup was more interesting
than the game itself.
Expected starters Janoris Jenkins (cornerback), Jer-
maine Cunningham (defensive end), Lawrence Marsh
(defensive tackle) and Ahmad Black (safety) didn't take
their usual places on the field.
Marsh was in shorts after spraining an ankle last
week, but Cunningham and Jenkins were fully dressed
out. Jenkins' absence likely stems from an arrest over the
summer, and Meyer refused to shed any light on Cun-
ningham's situation, saying the preseason all-South-
eastern Conference selection "wasn't ready to play."
Meanwhile, Black was simply beaten out by Hill in
practice for the starting spot. It's not often that a player
leads the nation in interceptions, as Black did last year,
and then loses his place on the field, so that shows the
confidence the coaching staff has in Hill.
With three talented safeties available, Meyer says the
top two spots will be up for grabs each week.
"Whoever has the best week of practice plays,"
Meyer said. "We have three guys who have earned the
right to start, so we have three starters. They're pretty
interchangeable, and that's what every coach looks for
because they can all play two different positions."OL Johnson expected to

sitting out against Charleston Southern.
"Dustin Doe at this point is week to week, and day to day,
but if we played tomorrow, he'd be eligible to play," Meyer said.
"Janoris Jenkins, if he has a good week of practice, he'll be eli-
gible to play as well."
Doe was suspended for the game against Charleston South-
ern after being arrested in July for driving with a suspended
license.
Meyer would not confirm that Jenkins was
suspended, but the sophomore, who started 12
games last year, did not play at all.
Jenkins was Tasered and arrested in June onFoot ball misdemeanor charges of affray and resisting ar-
rest without violence following an altercation
outside a Gainesville bar.
ETC: Meyer said offensive lineman Carl Johnson, who left Sat-
urday's game in the second quarter after an apparent leg injury,
suffered a bone bruise but is probable for this week's matchup
against Troy. .Defensive end Jermaine Cunningham sat out
against the Buccaneers because he was "not ready to play," ac-
cording to Meyer.
