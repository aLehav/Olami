Dr. Stephanie Ryan wants to break the ste-
reotypes associated with LGBT patients.  
The UF Health Shands Hospital pediatric 
physician is working to create a club within the 
UF College of Medicine called LGBT People in Medicine to provide supplemental learning 
on LGBT patient care.
“I’m a lesbian — and I’m ﬁ  ne being out — 
and I saw this as a need in the education of our 
medical students,” she said.
The Association of American Medical Col-
leges announced that doctors need to better serve their LGBT patients. With her club, Ryan said she hopes to train the next generation to accomplish this.
LB Hannahs, director of 
UF’s LGBT Affairs, keeps a list of doctors approved as LGBT-friendly and those deemed to be unfriendly to-ward students in the LGBT community. Hannahs said some doctors become un-
comfortable treating these 
patients and often see them as suffering from 
psychological disorders.
“Historically, the medical community has 
treated LGBT as a disease,” Hannahs said. “There’s still a lot of apprehension and fear.”
Hannahs said medical students should be required to take speciﬁ  c classes to learn how to handle and treat LGBT patients.
However, LGBT studies is a part of the UF 
medical curriculum.  
First-year medical students have a panel 
discussion that focuses on LGBT patients. Then during their second year, they learn about reproduction and hormones and then ﬁ  nally as third-year students, they attend a 
two-hour lecture on health care needs of LGBT 
individuals.
Ryan said students go through medical 
scenarios involving transgender patients. Stu-dents also have the option to take additional classes that go into more detail about care, such as family planning for same-sex couples, transgender medicine and elderly LGBT treat-ment.
“It’s a population that has some unique 
health care and needs ... it’s important for doc-tors to be aware of the needs to be able to treat them properly,” Ryan said.
Through LGBT People in Medicine, Ryan 
said she wants to foster a sense of community for LGBT medical students and to provide ed-
ucation on this patient population. She plans 
to have the club running by Spring.
Hannahs hopes to not have to carry around 
a list of approved doctors one day, but will keep the list handy for students until then.
“(Doctors need) to learn how to treat LGBT 
people as individuals,” Hannahs said.UF physician to create LGBT-friendly medical club

This Thanksgiving, about 40 percent of UF’s 4,000 grad-
uate assistants will earn salaries below the federal poverty 
line. Many will struggle to feed their families.
UF’s Graduate Assistants United hopes to help ﬁ  ll that 
gap.
The organization will collect nonperishable food and 
household items today and Thursday between 10 a.m. and 
2 p.m. on the Plaza of the Americas.
Organizing chair Sebastián Sclofsky said items will be 
distributed to graduate students Monday on a ﬁ  rst-come, 
ﬁ  rst-served basis.
“It’s a very difﬁ  cult situation for all of us,” Sclofsky, 37, 
said. “We shouldn’t be wasting time ﬁ  ghting these ﬁ  ghts, but unfortunately, administration policies give us no al-ternative.”

The UF Student Senate was 
joined by Gainesville city com-
missioners Tuesday to discuss 
transportation, Gainesville life and student safety.
Instead of meeting in the Sen-
ate chambers located in the UF 
Levin College of Law, 82 senators, 
ﬁ  ve commissioners and mayor Ed 
Braddy met at UF Hillel. UF Stu-dent Body President Cory Yeffet worked with Braddy to bring city government and Senate together. While there is no set date for an-other joint meeting, he said he 
would like SG to get involved 
with the City Commission.
“This is something we haven’t done since 2011. Hopefully, we’llactually see tangible results on this,” Yeffet said.
Braddy said Gainesville’s re-
lationship with the colleges mu-tually beneﬁ  t the community in terms of expanding and building up Gainesville.
“We cannot be great city un-
less our colleges, Santa Fe and 
UF, are great,”  Braddy said.

◗ SQUARE WILL HANDLE THE 
MONEY TRANSFERS.
PATRICK PINAK
Alligator Staff Writer ppinak@alligator.org
Snapchat users can now put their money 
where their face is — by sending “Snap-
cash” to friends.
The popular photo-messaging app an-
nounced Monday that users can now trans-
fer money to friends. Peer-to-peer money 
transferring company Square will handle all the transactions for Snapchat users.
To send Snapcash, users must enter their 
debit card information, which Square stores. Users can then swipe to the chat feature and type the dollar sign and amount before hit-ting the green “send” button. They must be at least 18 years old and reside in the U.S. 
But due to Snapchat’s past security 
breaches, one UF computer and informa-tion science engineering professor, Joseph Wilson, said he isn’t sold on Snapcash.
“Although they’re not doing the trans-
fers, there might be other reasons why you might not want to use Snapchat,” he said.
Users should investigate Square before 
entering their debit card information, he 
said. One way to do this is to search for any company vulnerability assessments.
“Your reliance on these companies is a 
thing you have to individually decide,” he 
said.
Square is subject to the Payment Card 
Industry Data Security Standard, but the re-quirements are low, Wilson said. This was evident in Target’s data breach last year and 
Home Depot’s data breach in September. 
UF economics professor Doug Waldo 
said Snapcash won’t affect the use of tangi-
ble cash. He said mobile payment is simply an another way to conduct transactions.
“The history has been that there’s a de-
creasing role for cash in society because we found new ways of making payments,” he said. “But cash doesn’t go out of exis-
tence.”
Snapcash could be a way for Square to 
compete with companies like Venmo, Pay-
Pal and Apple Pay. UF marketing senior 
Carrieanne Reichardt is also wary.
“Snapchat is known for pictures, not in-
formation,” the 21-year-old said. 
Starbucks barista Christina Dilbone, 21, 
said people use Apple Pay at her store all 
the time, but she wouldn’t use Snapcash. 
“I don’t like giving personal info to 
companies online,” the UF sociology senior said, “not to mention they’ve had problems in the past.”Snapchat debuts ‘Snap-
cash,’ users wary of securitystudy

Despite multiple setbacks, Thais Evans is 
on track to obtaining his college degree. 
UF education junior Evans, 26, is one of 
the 4.5 million non-first time students who 
went back to college after taking a break.
According to data from the National 
Student Clearinghouse Research Center, 66 percent of students who re-enroll never get their degree.
“There are a host of reasons for that,” 
said Angeleah Browdy, the director for the UF Office of Academic Support.
Browdy said financial issues, lack of fam-
ily support and academic trouble could be 
possible reasons for students to stop their 
schooling and drop out, or “stop out.” 
“Although UF is concerned about reten-
tion, stopouts aren’t necessarily at the fore-front of what they think about,” she said.
UF’s 2011 retention rate was 95.98 per-
cent, and since 2003, it has been between 95 and 96 percent. Although UF’s four-year graduation rate is 65 percent, the six-year 
graduation rate is higher at 86.51 percent.
“We have a really high retention rate be-
cause of the kind of students we bring in,” 
said Jeanna Mastrodicasa, the assistant vice president for Student Affairs. “We don’t have a lot of nontraditional-age students or part-time students.” Browdy said UF could add more central-
ized support services and create an institu-tionalized research project on the topic.
“The research project can help delve 
deeper into why these students leave UF,” she said. “As far as I’m concerned, we can’t afford to have any subpopulation without a 
degree.” 
For Evans, there were a number of fac-
tors that played into his delayed decision 
on reapplying, he said. Evans took several breaks during his time as a Sante Fe College student after he lost his financial aid due to academic obstacles.  
“Some people, they stop for 20 years, and 
they come back and decide they want to get 
a degree,” Evans said. “It would be good if 
there was someone who you could talk to, who could be an adviser.” 
UF offers resources to students like Ev-
ans who have had to stop and start their col-lege experience again. 
The Fresh Start Program is designed to 
assist former UF undergraduate students who have been dismissed from UF and want 
to pursue readmission after an absence of no 
fewer than five years, according to the UF advising website. 
Mastrodicasa said she understands that 
life gets in the way.
“We are always looking for ways to sup-
port our students,” she said.   More than half of re-enrolled 
students don’t finish degree4, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 19, 2014

UF senators confront city commissioners Tuesday night about transportation, housing 
and safety issues around Gainesville at the Joint City Commission/UF Student Body Special Meeting at UF Hillel.
They discussed RTS expansion, off-campus leasing problems 
“It’s important that students have a re-
liable safe means of transportation,”  Mi-
chaels said.
City Commissioner for District II Todd 
Chase said student involvement with RTS is vital because 60 percent of RTS funding comes from student fees pay.
Jesus Gomez, RTS director, said it will 
add about 16,000 hours of service next year, including more weekend service. Gomez said the increase in RTS availabil-ity would probably add a 53-cent increase. 
He also said RTS is exploring sustainable 
busses that are less oil dependent and run on alternative fuel, such as compressed natural gas.  
RTS currently has five hybrid-electric 
busses and plans to add more in the fu-ture.
Sen. Jenny Clements brought up the is-
sue of towing such as increased fees and 
hard-to-find towing signs.
Commissioner Chase said measures 
will be taken if towing signs are not easily visible or have bad marking.
“Our biggest thing is to hold the com-
pany’s accountable to a higher standard,” 
he said.
Michaels moved the discussion to liv-
ing in Gainesville after graduation.  
Sen. Elvin Lopez addressed to the com-
missioners leasing issues for students tak-ing classes during Summer. Some leases 
end at the same time exams are taking 
place, and sometimes students need to find other living arrangements while deal-ing with the stress of exams, he said.
Commissioner Helen Warren said be-
cause the apartment complexes are part of the free market, it’s difficult for the city to take action.
Michaels shifted the forum to student 
safety. Gainesville Chief of Police Tony Jones answered questions about how GPD works with UF to create a safe environ-ment for students.
Braddy left the meeting with a small 
piece of advice for senators:
“Take ownership of the city. You have 
a stake in the future of this city.”SenA te , from page 1
It’s meant to help graduate assistants who struggle financially
ries that range from $30,000 to 
$40,000, graduate assistants often can’t afford Thanksgiving din-
ners for their families.
According to the organization, 
last week it was expected to pay 
about $700 in fees to the univer-
sity.
“Working people shouldn’t 
have to go to charity,” said Sclof-
sky, a political science graduate assistant from Uruguay. “Work-
ing people shouldn’t be on food 
stamps.”
Sclofsky said he hopes the 
drive serves a dual purpose of 
raising awareness to the chal-
lenges graduate assistants con-tinue to face, particularly those from abroad.
“When you are coming from 
abroad and you are coming to a place like the University of Flori-da, you never think these are the 
working conditions you are com-
ing to,” he said.
Graduate students have also 
expressed concern over paying the mandatory fees as a result of UF’s campaign to become a top-
10 institution.Graduate assistant Taylor Pol-
vadore, 22, conducted research 
based on U.S. News & World Re-port’s Top Public Schools of 2014 
that suggests that, on average, 
universities ranked in the top 25 cover half or more of graduate students’ fees.
According to the data, UF re-
quires graduate students to pay nearly all the fees.
“The fees are astronomical 
when you look at all of the other 
universities that are in the top 
25,” Polvadore said. “I’d like to have better communication and more transparency about what exactly our fees are being used 
for.”
Sclofsky said the organization 
would like to work with univer-
sity administration to alleviate 
the issue by increasing graduate 
assistants’ salaries, lowering fees and increasing health  care cover-age.
“I think the university should 
open their doors to us and come and talk to us,” Sclofsky said. “They are not going to be able to do it without us.”Drive , from page 1CAMpuS

ed during Election Day,” Mastrodicasa said.
Representatives from UF groups, including Women’s Stu-
dent Union, Pride Student Union, Asian-American Student Union and Society of Women Engineers will present at the ad-dress, Novak said. Invites were also sent out to Gainesville’s mayor, city manager, City Commission and University Police.

Employers and students braved 
the cold Tuesday on the Reitz Union 
Breezeway to talk about jobs.  
This was the fourth year the UF 
Entrepreneurship Club hosted the 
Startup Job and Internship Fair  and 
the first year it partnered with the Career Resource Center.
“We are trying to up everything 
this year,” Erick Rodriguez, the president of the club, said.
The CRC partnership allowed 
the club to draw in more employers and expand its outreach to students, 
said Rodriguez, a 20-year-old UF 
business management junior.
The event hosted about 25 em-
ployers and more than 300 students throughout the day, he said. In pre-vious years, about 100 students met with 10 employers.
Neat Biz Solutions, a medical-
consultation startup company in the 
UF Innovation Hub, has been one 
of the employers at the event before and is coming back. Tracy Jones, the office manager, said they are look-ing forward to it.
“It’s a great resource to come out 
and connect with students,” Jones said.
Employees who attended the 
event included Grooveshark, Mind-tree, CollegeVox and Fracture, Inc. Larger companies, including Net-flix, are scheduled for the next fair, Rodriguez said. 
Startup companies are showing 
more interest in the fair because they 
are generally small companies that 
need extra workers, said Aniruddh Ravindran, executive vice president of the entrepreneurship club.
“Their mission is to build 
Gainesville as a popular workplace,” said Ravindran, a 22-year-old UF biomedical engineer second-year master student.
Earl Ziebarth, president and CEO 
of MyTime Schools, an app to man-age high school sporting events, was the Student Body president in 1986. He said he wished the event was available when he was a student. 
“It’s a great asset,” he said. “It’s 
nice being around sharp entrepre-neurs and students.”
Philip Kubiszyn, a UF finance 
sophomore, said the fair created an optimistic atmosphere.
“Any opportunity is a great op-
portunity here at the university,” the 19-year-old said.WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 19, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 5

When JP Bremer saw “John 
Wick” with his father this weekend, 
he noticed his chair shook during 
intense scenes.
“My elbow was on the armrest 
next to my dad’s,” said Bremer, 
a UF exploratory sophomore. “I 
looked over, and the whole right 
side of his body was shaking.”
Bremer’s 60-year-old father, 
Fred, was diagnosed with Parkin-son’s disease in 2012.“Whenever he gets kind of ner-
vous or stressed about something, he starts to shake,” the-19-year-old said. “Just knowing that it’s going to get worse later on in life is a big 
challenge.”
Bremer felt somewhat relieved 
when he heard about CareMAP, 
a free online guide to caring for people with advanced Parkinson’s 
disease. The website, announced by 
the National Parkinson Foundation on Wednesday, gives family mem-bers and caregivers suggestions on how to handle problems related to advanced Parkinson’s.
“There’s a lot of information on 
things I haven’t even considered yet,” Bremer said. “I like that I’ll have a website there for reference when I need it.”
Dr. Michael S. Okun, national medical director of the National 
Parkinson Foundation and profes-
sor at UF Health Shands, helped produce the resource.
Parkinson’s patients are highly 
dependent on care partners, and re-
search has shown that the greatest 
success of patients hinges on care-partner quality, Okun said.
He believes CareMAP, which 
uses articles and videos to supply information about living with and caring for people with Parkinson’s, will improve caregiver quality.
There are six main categories 
of care on the website, including home care, outside assistance and long-distance help.Leilani Pearl, vice president of 
communications at the foundation, said the interactive content allows family members and caregivers to set their own pace for helping pa-tients. 
“Everyone’s at a different stage 
when it comes to advanced Parkin-son’s, so it lets you access the bits of information that are relevant to you 
in that moment in time,” she said.
The foundation plans to publish 
a complementary print resource, 
which would be an update on the original book and manuals used to 
form the website, Pearl said. The 
publication should be available in December.

Four days after Daniel Lavaughn Jer-
kins was arrested for aggravated domes-
tic assault, he was arrested again after po-lice said he picked up his 5-year-old son from school and later smoked a marijuana 
blunt in front of him Tuesday evening. 
Because of the aggravated assault 
charges, the 28-year-old was not allowed 
to have unsupervised visits with his son, Gainesville Police spokesman Officer Ben Tobias wrote in an email. He also had a warrant out for felony battery charges. The Department of Children and Fam-
ilies contacted police after a third party 
told them about Jerkins picking up his 
child, a report said. 
When police arrived at Jerkins’ Oxford 
Manor apartment at about 7:30 p.m., they could see him smoking a blunt through the window in front of the 5-year-old, ac-cording to a report. There were two other children in the home at the time, ages 3 and 6. Police said when they opened the 
door, an “overwhelming smell of freshly 
burnt cannabis poured outside.” 
Jerkins was arrested on battery charges 
and child abuse without great harm. He is being held on a $2,000 bond for child abuse charges. A bond has not been set for the battery charges. Police: man lights up blunt,

UF’s pre-health honor society and a local 
health nonprofit organization are teaming 
up to host an HIV testing and sexual health awareness event for the first time today.
The WellFlorida Council will be admin-
istering free HIV tests, while Alpha Epsilon Delta will spread the word on safe sex from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. on the Reitz Union Lawn.
Students will have the chance to win prizes 
through Q-and-A games.
Naomi Ardjomand-Kermani, HIV preven-
tion specialist for WellFlorida, said the agency will be administering the OraSure HIV test. Specialists will use a small toothbrush-like in-
strument to swab mouths, and then students 
can obtain their results within two weeks.
Ardjomand-Kermani said WellFlorida of-
fers programs for HIV-positive individuals to receive the medical care they need.
UF nursing sophomore Maddie Beeler, 
who is also a member of Alpha Epsilon Delta, said the event is a great way to spread aware-ness about sexually transmitted infections.
“A lot of people are aware about HIV but 
don’t take the time to get tested and take care of themselves,” the 19-year-old said.
Other organizations providing sexual 
health information at the event include Planned Parenthood, UF Women’s Student Association, Chronic Gators, GatorWell and the Pre-Physician Assistant Association.
Allison Villarreal, a UF finance sophomore, 
said some people are scared to go into a doc-tor’s office to get tested for HIV.
“This event is great for people who are wor-
ried, concerned or just want to be safe about 
their sexual health,” Villarreal, 20, said.Free HIV tests on North Lawn

Vote or post a message at www.alligator.orgTuesday’s question: Did you get caught 
in the rain?Today’s question: Should e-cigarettes be regulated?Fellow students, go the f*** to sleep
Recently, I have gotten less than 10 full hours of sleep 
every week.
The sad thing about this statement is that it prob-
ably isn’t very shocking to most readers. According to a study from Brown University, 73 percent of college-age students report having sleeping problems of some kind. We, as university students, are some of the most sleep-deprived people in the U.S. — and even the world.
This is old news though, isn’t it? People have been talk-
ing about the trope of the overworked student for longer than I’ve been alive. College students work hard. College students party hard. College students can pick two op-tions out of the mocking triangle of life: Would you like to have adequate sleep, good grades or a social life? Usually, sleeping gets booted out of the equation.
I myself shouldn’t even protest; I pulled an extreme all-
nighter only a few days ago.
The average college student treats the essential act of 
passing the heck out and recharging one’s stamina, brain cells and functional capabilities as optional. This mode of behavior has started to become more dangerous to us than the illusion that if we don’t stay up all night to ﬁ  nish studying for this exam, our GPA will inevitably suffer.
The idea that time spent avoiding sleep will beneﬁ  t you 
in other aspects of your life, whether social or academic, is false.
Getting a few hours of shut-eye will probably help you 
remember more material on that next killer exam. Manag-ing naps during the day will make you less crabby and probably more fun to be with. 
Within the past three months, 30 percent of college 
women and 18 percent of college men have reported suf-fering from insomnia, a disease that is affected by the amount of sleep you allow yourself. Chronic refusal to sleep affects the natural rhythms of your body and can seriously mess up your development, energy levels and learning capabilities, destroying your potential to do great things. Even as I write this, my ﬁ  ngers typing heavily on keys that seem so suddenly difﬁ  cult to press, I am scolding myself for hardly getting two hours of rest the other night: “Why didn’t you sleep, Sally?”
I think that we are often push-
ing against boundaries with our 
peers. We compare ourselves to one another: our work ethic, our drive, our qualiﬁ  cations, our grades. Often, the idea of not sleeping for an entire night in order to study might seem to give an individual bragging rights or an assertion of being a more dedicated student and harder worker. Sacriﬁ  ce of well-being and mental health in the name of hard work is sometimes expected by organiza-tions with extremely active members or in especially com-petitive or difﬁ  cult classes.
This anti-sleep mentality is foolish. Sleep is essential 
to the quality and continuity of life. While every student will sometimes have to sacriﬁ  ce their entire doctor-rec-ommended eight hours of rest, it doesn’t mean that we should deprive ourselves of sleep. It doesn’t mean that sleeping less than a friend one night will make you a bet-ter, more serious student.
After our upcoming and much-awaited Thanksgiving 
Break, it will be ﬁ  nal exam season, which is the time of long nights spent frantically studying at Library West and the time of tense nerves and frayed tempers. Sleep will be scarce. Let’s remember that when the next physics prob-lem starts to blur in front of you on the paper, it’s probably time to call it quits for at least the length of a power nap. We should stop using sleep to compare our study habits with others and just go to bed for a few hours. We’ll feel much better when we wake up.

position deepens 
corrupt ties
Last week, the Alligator published an editorial about Florida 
Attorney General Pam Bondi’s close ties to the Republican Attorneys General Association — RAGA. The organiza-
tion is heavily supported by donations from interest groups sup-porting large corporations and from corporations themselves. 
RAGA has handsomely repaid the investments made by these 
corporate groups, ﬁ  ghting against environmental protections, ﬁ  nancial regulations and labor rights, all of which threaten cor-porate proﬁ  ts.
During the 2014 campaign cycle, RAGA donated more than 
$750,000 to Bondi’s re-election campaign. The group also pro-vided her with free trips to conferences at high-class resorts in Hawaii and California. Reuters reported that all this occurred while Bondi’s ofﬁ  ce “considered legal actions against some cor-
porate clients of ﬁ  rms supporting (RAGA).”
Now, Bondi has taken her corrupt relationship with RAGA 
to the next level by becoming the group’s chair. In announcing 
her new position, Bondi promised that RAGA would “continue to stand up for the rule of law and protect the citizens of our states.”
Bondi has vigorously denied that any lobbyist or corporation 
would inﬂ  uence her decisions as attorney general.
“No lobbyist, no person, no corporation, no individual will 
ever compromise what we do in our ofﬁ  ce,” she said. “I’m proud of what we’ve done to protect consumers.”
Bondi must be forgetting about the ongoing investigation by 
the Florida Commission on Ethics into her ofﬁ  ce’s relationship with Washington law ﬁ  rm Dickstein Shapiro.
The New York Times reported that Dickstein Shapiro, which 
has contributed to RAGA, “specializes in building personal re-lationships with state attorneys general to help corporate clients avoid becoming targets of investigation.” The complaint alleges 
that a representative of Dickstein Shapiro failed to register as a 
lobbyist before attempting to inﬂ  uence Bondi’s ofﬁ  ce.
Bondi’s claim that her ofﬁ  ce is free from corporate inﬂ  uence 
is dubious, to say the least. Even if her assertions are true, the unmistakable appearance of rampant corruption and corporate inﬂ  uence in Bondi’s ofﬁ  ce is shameful and unbecoming of some-one who claims to treasure morality and the rule of law.
The truth is that Bondi owes her re-election in large part to the 
donations from RAGA. Her Democratic opponent, George Shel-
don, was massively underfunded and essentially hung out to 
dry by the Florida Democratic Party. Even so, Sheldon received 42 percent of the vote to Bondi’s 55 percent. In a race where both candidates had equivalent — or at least similar — ﬁ  nancial re-sources, the outcome might have been much different.
Now that she has been re-elected, Florida voters shouldn’t 
be surprised if Bondi spends more time serving the interests of her corporate donors than she does supporting and upholding 
the Florida Constitution. Those corporations expect continuing 
returns on their investment, and Bondi’s enthusiasm for leading RAGA suggests she is eager to provide them.WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 19, 2014

Clay Olsen’s column, “Democrats mistake gov-
ernment spending for kind-heartedness,” was a conservative attempt to deﬁ  ne liberalism as 
willy-nilly government handouts to the poor. He cites 
Lyndon Johnson’s “War on Poverty” and declares it 
a failure without mentioning its success before for-mer President Ronald Reagan gutted the program. He mentioned Medicare liabilities without mention-ing that President Barack Obama and  U.S. Rep. Paul 
Ryan proposed to cut the same amount from the pro-
gram. The big difference in the cuts is that Obama tar-gets fraud on the supply side of Medicare, whereas Ryan proposed exclusively consumer-side cuts, which 
would increase the copay of every American. 
If you compare the age of 
tax-and-spend liberalism from the 1940s through the 1970s 
with the age of neoliberal capi-talism from the 1980s to today, the former had a strong middle class, strong unions, lower college tuitions, strong liberal arts, social mo-
bility, balanced budgets, tariffs, pensions, a higher 
minimum wage, lower unemployment and a faster growing economy than anything the right-wing re-forms did in the 1980s and 1990s. People have long 
forgotten that there wasn’t much government before 
the Great Depression. People have forgotten that the great American middle-class was fought for. The rich 
did not hand out a middle class. People were shot 
dead in the streets for trying to unionize this country. In the 1950s, the top employer was GM, which pro-vided high-paying jobs with health care and pensions. There were unions. Today, the No. 1 employer is Wal-
Mart, which has 1.5 million workers in poverty. There 
are no pensions and health care. Vacation time and sick leave take years to accrue. Moreover, the money in food stamps and welfare that conservatives often 
decry allows CEOs and executives to not pay work-
ers with living wages, let alone middle-class wages. If anything, CEOs and executives are real beneﬁ  ciaries of the social safety net.
The core of liberalism is the belief in equal op-
portunity and equal power of voice. When we look around and see one kid who drives to school in a new BMW, travels to Europe, eats well, attends a better public  or private school, whose parents are never ﬁ  -
nancially stressed, and then see the kid growing up on 
food stamps, whose parents are constantly worrying about ﬁ  nances, who lives a desperate childhood with a sense of inferiority, worries  about getting shot as he or she walks home from school, whose schools are 
underfunded, and teachers are underpaid, who never 
gets to travel and sees nothing but a cave of poverty, we should now know that resources matter. Anyone who genuinely believes in hard work and meritocracy 
must actively ﬁ  ght for equal opportunity. 
Henry David Thoreau famously said, “That gov-
ernment is best which governs least.” Thomas Jeffer-son said, “I believe that banking institutions are more 
dangerous to our liberties than standing armies.”  Making sure teachers, ﬁ  reﬁ  ghters and police ofﬁ  cers can own a home and retire is not part of big govern-ment. The real big government is the massive mili-
tary and surveillance state. Liberals believe in a social 
contract: Those who beneﬁ  t most in society should pay back to maintain equal opportunity. Otherwise, get out! We’ll keep our roads, our ﬁ  reﬁ  ghters and our 
universities.

Speaking OutIn eight days, many students will gather 
around tables and eat all kinds of deli-cious, artery-clogging foods with family 
members and friends.
In eight days, I will partake in the above 
but will also discover the world is going to end. Again.
Every year at the Thanksgiving table, I 
am startled to ﬁ  nd humanity is near com-plete and total doom. If one listened to my family’s Thanksgiving conversations close-ly, one might speculate that the Mayan cal-endar ended every year on Black Friday.
Perhaps I am exaggerating slightly because my family 
is not ﬁ  lled with nihilists who have no hope for society. However, when conversation takes a turn from school and daily life to politics and the general state of the pub-lic, things get a little doomsday-ish. I think this pessi-mism is mostly unwarranted.
There is no ignoring or denying that there is bad in 
this world. However, there is also always hope, innova-tion, progress and young people who can make it hap-pen.
 On Thanksgiving, I will once again be enlightened to 
the fact that things just “aren’t how they used to be.” I can already hear my dad half-jokingly but half-seriously saying, “That’s not my America.”
Potential topics for the part of Thanksgiving discus-
sion devoted to politics include ISIS and circumstances in Ferguson, Missouri, among others.
ISIS is a valid point of conversation, and it is worthy 
of discussion. The beheadings of American journalists 
Steven Sotloff and James Foley, and more recently, the 
beheading of American aid worker Peter Kassig, are hor-rendous. 
We should in no way become ignorant or disinter-
ested simply because there are certain things we don’t want to discuss because they’re sad or disturbing. No one enjoys the thoughts and emotions that accompany bad news, but we can’t ignore them.
However, if all we do is dwell on the negative emo-
tion, nothing will change either. The ISIS conversation at my Thanksgiving will most deﬁ  nitely include phrases like “What’s the world coming to?” and “How did we let things get this bad?”
I agree. This is bad, but that doesn’t mean the prob-
lem can’t be solved or lessened.
Focusing on what can be done instead of dwelling on 
the bad seems like a much more productive topic of con-versation.
In fact, embracing those difﬁ  cult emotions will create 
a less apathetic and more passionate public to elect lead-ers who can ﬁ  ght this evil.
To answer the questions about how the world got this 
way, I pose this thought: America and the world have been in pretty bad jams before.World wars are a good example. These 
things ended. They ended at great costs that cannot be minimized, but they ended.
This is nothing new under the sun.  Furthermore, the civil unrest in Fergu-
son, Missouri, will most likely come up.
Earlier this week, Missouri Gov. Jay 
Nixon authorized the National Guard to become active in Ferguson if necessary after the jury’s verdict is released about Michael Brown’s death at the hands of police ofﬁ  cer Darren Wilson. 
“What has our society come to?” “I hate to see anyone 
get killed.” Everyone at the table will nod and “hmmm” 
sympathetically.
It is sad and troubling that this is happening. It is un-
fortunate, and the looting and rioting in Ferguson is es-
pecially devastating for the town itself.
 However, let’s consider how far race relations have 
come in this country and how much further they can go.
Perhaps this is an opportunity for great social change. 
The beginnings of it may be covered in injustice — the court will decide that — but there’s still the potential for 
good to stem from it despite the awful circumstances.
ISIS and Ferguson are just a few topics that will come 
up. Ebola will be one, and of course, President Barack 
Obama’s name will make an appearance.
What’s a family get-together without that one relative 
who despises the current president, no matter the politi-cal party?
Granted I know I am young, and because of this, I am 
innately naïve.
No matter how educated or well-read I am, there is 
something about youth that makes me look on the bright side for a little bit longer.
UF is ﬁ  lled with bright, young people. It’s hard for me 
to be Eeyore for too long when I see the endless possibili-ties coming from the young minds here.
This is a cliche to say the least, but the students on this 
campus are the future. We can change things if we want to, or we can at least try. 
Understanding bad circumstances is vital to success, 
but dwelling in negativity for too long accomplishes nothing. 
This Thanksgiving, I will nod and most likely stuff 
my face with potato casserole and crescent rolls for as long as possible before I speak up during the stint of con-versation about politics. 
However, I might not need to. My grandparents 
read my columns on their dial-up Internet service every 
Wednesday. 
I’m sure, as the doting and loving grandparents that 
they are, they will have no trouble informing my family 
about my stances on these topics.

As Katharine Hargrave prepared for 
her classes, she packed her backpack with 
notebook paper, books and her laptop. 
Lifting the bag across her back, the bag 
didn’t seem to weigh her down, but some-thing else did — the clunk of change trail-ing behind her. 
By the time Hargrave graduates, she 
will have accumulated more than $40,000 in debt.
“I have Bright Futures, but everything 
else is loans,” said the 21-year-old adver-
tising junior. “I do have a job, but it’s at 
home in Jacksonville, and it’s seasonal.”Hargrave is one of the thousands of 
students at UF who take out student loans every year.
In the 2013-2014 school year, UF stu-
dents borrowed more than $267 million in student loans. From 2012 to 2013, more than $269 million student loans were dis-bursed, according to the UF Office for Stu-
dent Financial Affairs.
Since 2012, UF has seen a $1.5 million 
decrease in student loans, which coincides 
with a College Board trend study that 
found that student loans are decreasing.
But Rick Wilder, the director of the of-
fice for student financial affairs, said there 
has been a decrease in the number of bor-rowers but not in the average amount of loans students take out at UF.
“It has been a trend in that last year or 
two,” he said.
According to the College Board study, 
students in the 2013-2014 school year bor-rowed less money, despite the growing 
rate of tuition. 
Wilder said the study does not take into 
consideration the inflation of the dollar. 
The study also contains graduate and pro-fessional students, who are more likely to 
take out more loans due to higher costs, he said.
Hargrave’s loans have increased from 
last year by about $10,000.
“My younger sister just started going 
to UF as well,” she said. “And the amount 
needed for my grandma’s nursing home 
has increased, and we are having to sup-
plement even more.”
She took out $9,305 in loans for the Fall 
semester and said it will be about the same 
for Spring. She’s used her loans to pay off 
her tuition, living expenses and other fees like a new laptop.
Hargrave plans on attending graduate 
school, but she said she doesn’t know how 
she is going to pay off her loans. 
“I’m absolutely clueless,” she said. Less money borrowed nationally; fewer UF students getting loans

Kevin Skipper smoked 30 
cigarettes a day for 15 years. 
And then he quit.
But he still “smokes.”Since the first time he in-
haled the blackberry-flavored vapor from an electronic cigarette, he was hooked. He switched his bulky pack of Marlboro Ultra Lights for a sleek vape pen.
But come Thursday, e-cig-
arettes, which don’t contain tobacco but rather turn liquid 
nicotine into vapor, may be 
placed under the same um-brella as traditional cigarettes.
Even though e-cigarettes do 
not produce smoke or smell, the City Commission will vote on an ordinance that forbids the use of e-cigarettes where smoking is already prohibited, 
said City Commissioner at 
Large, Helen K. Warren.
The meeting is at 1 p.m. 
Thursday at the City Hall Au-ditorium.
“If it looks like a cigarette 
and acts like a cigarette, we will treat it like a cigarette,” Warren said.
E-cigarette users like Skip-
per are about 60 percent more likely to quit tobacco than smokers who do cold turkey, according to a U.K. study. Yet the city commission voted unanimously on the first ap-proval. 
“This ordinance doesn’t tell 
you how to quit,” Warren said. “It just tells you where you can’t do it.”
If the ordinance receives 
its second and final approval Thursday, it will become effec-tive immediately.
“Tobacco kills 1,100 people a 
day, and we don’t want to give 
people a reason to go back to them,” said Skipper, the presi-dent of a nonprofit corporation 
called VISTA Truth, which pro-motes vaping businesses.
The ordinance will define 
e-cigarettes as combustible to-bacco products, Warren said. Alachua County and five cit-ies around Gainesville have already passed the ordinance, 
including Archer, Hawthorne 
and High Springs.
“There’s a lot of synthetic 
cannabis, and when you get new items in your commu-nity, you have to ask yourself if there should be a policy or not,” Warren said. “We de-cided to comply with county 
statutes.”
Skipper hopes to persuade 
city commissioners at the 
meeting to become informed through workshops and pan-els before making a decision.
“They are more than wel-
come to come speak,” Warren said, “but once you have an or-
dinance in place, it takes a lot 
to make it go in another direc-tion.”
The vapor market size is 
about $2.5 billion this year, ac-cording to a report from Wells Fargo Securities.
The owner of The Grab Bag 
Co., a local e-cigarette store, said almost all people who come into his store and want to 
quit tobacco products do so.
“As far as business goes, 
every week, our sales percent-
age goes up,” said owner Jacob Jones. He said he doesn’t wor-ry about a decline in sales.
UF political science sopho-
more Alfredo Ramirez, 19, said he hadn’t heard of the initiative but believes it’s a mistake.
“I think it is misguided, 
especially when it is done for ‘public health’ and the ‘pub-lic good’ when the short- and long-term health effects have not been drawn conclusively 
by the scientific community,” 
he said.City Commission to

JERUSALEM  — Israel vowed 
harsh retaliation Tuesday for a Pal-
estinian attack that killed five peo-ple and left blood-smeared prayer books and shawls on the floor of a 
synagogue in Jerusalem.
The attack during morning 
prayers in the West Jerusalem 
neighborhood of Har Nof was car-ried out by two Palestinian cousins wielding meat cleavers, knives and a handgun. They were shot to death by police after the deadliest assault in the holy city since 2008.
The U.S.-born victims were iden-
tified as Moshe Twersky, 59, Aryeh Kupinsky, 43, and Kalman Levine, 55. The Israeli Foreign Ministry said the British man was Avraham Gold-berg, 68, who immigrated to Israel in 1993.
Palestinian President Mahmoud 
Abbas condemned the attack, the 
first time he has done so in the wave 
of deadly violence against Israelis. But he also called for an end to Is-raeli “provocations” surrounding Jerusalem’s shrines that are sacred to both Muslims and Jews.
Tuesday’s attack, however, ap-
peared to mark a turning point, with the gruesome scene in a house of worship shocking a nation long ac-customed to violence.
In one of Israel’s first acts of re-
taliation, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the deaths of the “innocent and pure Jews.” In a nationally televised address, he ac-
cused Abbas of inciting the recent 
violence and said the Palestinian leader’s condemnation of the attack was insufficient.
Hamas, the militant Palestin-
ian group that runs the Gaza Strip, praised the attack. In Gaza, dozens celebrated in the streets.
Late Tuesday, several hundred 
Jewish youths marched through downtown Jerusalem, blocking traf-fic and chanting, “Death to Arabs.” 
Police identified the synagogue 
attackers as Ghassan and Oday Abu Jamal, cousins from the Jabal Muk-aber neighborhood in East Jerusa-lem.
Police spokesman Micky Rosen-
feld said the assailants were killed in a shootout with police that left one officer critically wounded. He said police were still trying to determine 
how the men had chosen their tar-
get.
Mohammed Zahaikeh, a social 
activist in Jabal Mukaber, said he did not know whether the cousins were politically active. He said Ghassan was 27, married with two young children and worked in a clothing store. Oday, 21, was not married and 
was an interior decorator. He said 
both men were quiet, and residents were surprised by the attack.

RESEARCH
HANNAH HELMS

UF researchers have released new findings 
on the embryonic origin of external genitalia 
and birth defects. 
Researchers Martin Cohn and Ana Herre-
ra studied the development of bird embryos 
to understand and identify the cells, known 
as progenitor cells, that make up external genitalia.
Cohn, a Howard Hughes Medical Insti-
tute scientist and professor in the Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology in the UF College of Medicine, and Herrera, a doctoral graduate of the College of Medicine Interdisciplinary Program in Biomedical Sci-ences, reported their findings in the Nov. 5 is-sue of the online journal Scientific Reports.
Cohn said that birth defects of genitalia occur in one in every 250 children. 
In his research, fluorescent dyes were used 
to label small populations of cells in the chick embryos. UV lights allowed Cohn and Her-
rera to track the movement of the cells in liv-
ing embryos. What they found was that the cells didn’t start in the middle of the embryo body as they expected, Cohn said.
In the beginning of development, the em-
bryo starts off as a flat sheet of cells.
The genital progenitor cells start at oppo-
site ends of the embryo and come together during body wall closure when the flat em-
bryo closes the body wall around the inner 
organs to become a tubular structure.
“What that really tells you is that the single genital structure that sits between our legs come from two separate populations of cells that have to migrate long distance in the embryo and then fuse to form a single phal-lus,” Cohn said.
Cohn said the findings indicate that the 
process of genital development is closely tied to the process of body wall closure. 
“His illuminating work looking at the 
cellular mechanisms involved in the devel-opment of the external genitalia and lower urinary tract has potentially significant clini-

◗ RESEARCH SUGGESTS THEY BITE 
MORE FEMALE BIRDS THAN MALES.
MEGAN STENNES 
Alligator Contributing Writer
As mosquito activity wanes in the approach-
ing winter, a UF study released this month sug-
gests the paperclip-sized vampires bite female 
birds twice as much as males do.
Bugs often bite birds, which act as natural 
reservoirs for mosquitoes and carry diseases like 
Eastern equine encephalitis and West Nile virus.
The hypothesis just developed out of curiosity, 
said Nathan D. Burkett-Cadena, an assistant pro-fessor at the UF Medical Entomology Laboratory in Vero Beach where the study was conducted.
“If you look at the individuals infected with-
in a species, it is rarely 50/50,” Burkett-Cadena said. “There are disparities in mosquito exposure that are sex driven, and we have to look at this in 
more detail.”
Of the 3,500 different species of mosquitoes, 
he said, only three were used in the study. 
To conduct the research, mosquitoes were 
collected from the wild, Burkett-Cadena said. Through various tests, researchers were able to 
determine where the blood in each mosquito came from. 
Once you have that information, you can use 
it to determine ways to decrease bites, he said.
UF forestry senior Charlie Wilson, 24, said 
he spends a lot of time outdoors with the for-estry club. To fend off mosquitoes, Wilson said he wears pants and long sleeves. But even then, 
clothes don’t stop exposure.
 “I would love more research to be done to 
help know how to prevent mosquitoes from bit-
ing me,” Wilson said.Mosquitoes bite fewer male birds
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
AUSTIN, Texas — A Texas judge 
refused to quash on technicalities 
two criminal felony indictments for abuse of power against Gov. Rick Perry on Tuesday, ruling that 
the potentially embarrassing case 
against the 2016 presidential hope-ful should proceed.
The governor’s defense team 
sought to have the matter thrown out, arguing that the special pros-ecutor, Michael McCrum, wasn’t properly sworn in and some paper-work was incorrectly filed.
But a written ruling from District Judge Bert Rich-
ardson, who is a Republican, sided with McCrum.
“This court 
concludes that Mr. McCrum’s authority was not voided by proce-dural irregulari-
ties,” Richardson wrote.
An Austin grand jury indicted 
Perry in August on charges of abuse 
of official power and coercion of a 
public servant.
He is accused of publicly threat-
ening, then carrying out, a veto of state funding for public corruption prosecutors after the unit’s Demo-cratic district attorney refused to resign following a drunken driving 
conviction.
Perry made his first court ap-
pearance Nov. 6.
He calls the case a political witch 
hunt and says he’d issue the veto 
again.
His attorneys have also sought to 
have the charges against Perry dis-missed on constitutional grounds, 
but Richardson has yet to have a 
hearing on that challenge and isn’t expected to rule on it for weeks. Judge refuses to toss Perry case out

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
WASHINGTON — In a combustible 
blend of oil and politics, the Democratic-
controlled Senate rejected legislation Tues-day night to force the completion of the Keystone XL Pipeline. Republicans vowed to resurrect the controversial issue soon af-ter taking two-house control of Congress in January.
The 59-41 Senate vote was one short of the 60 needed to clear the House-passed measure and marked a severe blow to em-battled Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana.
While President Barack Obama and 
much of her party oppose the bill, the third-term Democrat had commandeered control of the chamber’s agenda in hopes of secur-ing approval of the project and boosting her chances in an uphill Dec. 6 runoff election.
All 45 Senate Republicans supported the 
legislation to build the Canada-to-Texas pipeline.
Only 14 of 55 Democrats and allied in-
dependents joined them, a total that didn’t budge despite an appeal by the Louisiana Democrat behind closed doors a few hours before the vote.
The vote was one of the last acts of this 
Senate controlled by the Democrats. It is ex-pected to complete its work by mid-Decem-ber.
But Republicans said a pipeline replay 
with the potential to spark a veto confronta-tion with Obama would be coming — and soon.Sen. Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Rep., 
and the incoming majority leader, said with-in minutes of the vote, “I look forward to the new Republican majority taking up and passing the Keystone jobs bill early in the new year.”
Her political career in jeopardy, Landrieu 
told reporters, “I’m going to fight for the people of my state until the day that I leave, and I hope that will not be soon.”
Rep. Bill Cassidy, Landrieu’s Republican 
opponent, said Louisiana families “need bet-ter jobs, better wages and better benefits,” and the pipeline would provide them.
Democrats defeat Keystone pipeline — but GOP vows replay 
The vote was narrow: 59-41“What that really tells you is that 
the single genital structure that sits 
between our legs come from two 
separate populations of cells that 
have to migrate very long distance 
in the embryo and then fuse to form 
a single phallus.”

Time for UF-FSU on hold
ESPN has elected to have a six-day hold on announcing the start time 
Florida-Florida State game, the Atlantic Coast Conference announced Monday. The game time will be announced after Saturday’s games.Becky Burleigh and UF soccer are taking the NCAA tournament one match at a time. Read the story on Page 14. Did you know?
Through two games this season, UF men’s basketball senior Jacob Kurtz leads the Gators with 7.5 rebounds per game, which ranks 11th in the SEC.JORDAN MCPHERSON
Alligator Staff Writer @J_McPherson1126
Florida offensive coordinator 
Kurt Roper is used to not staying in 
one place for too long.
For Roper and his two broth-
ers, they knew it was time to move 
whenever their dad — former col-
lege coach Bobby Roper — said he needed to have “a talk” with them.
Just like his father, Roper has 
done his fair share of moving since entering the coaching business in 1996. He’s worked at ﬁ  ve different universities, with his longest stint lasting six years at Ole Miss from 
1998-2004.
But this time, it might be his turn 
to initiate the talk when Florida’s 
season comes to an end. 
Roper said that since news broke 
Sunday about head coach Will Mus-champ not returning next season, he has yet to tell his two children — six-year-old Reese and two-year-old 
Luke — about the matter and what 
it could possibly mean for them.
“They don’t even know yet, so 
nobody tell my daughter,” Roper said, followed by a quick chuckle. “But, you know, my wife, it’s not her ﬁ  rst rodeo either. We got ﬁ  red at Ole Miss in 2004 and then at Kentucky and Tennessee and other places.”
Roper was hired with the inten-
tion of bringing life to an otherwise dying Florida offense. And through 
nine games, the unit’s heartbeat has 
been sporadic at best.The Gators have the 91st-ranked 
offense in the country averaging 373.3 yards per game and are 93rd nationally in yards per play (5.22).
There have been glimpses of ex-
plosive plays — such as Treon Har-ris’ 60-yard pass to Quinton Dunbar in Florida’s 34-10 win against Van-derbilt on Nov. 8 — but those plays have usually been followed by the conservative, run-the-ball-down-their-throat approach Gator fans have been used to seeing.
“I think everybody takes respon-
sibility when it doesn’t go well, I think the right people do,” Roper 
said. “That’s what I tell the players 
all the time. One thing that I never wanted to be is a ﬁ  nger pointer in anything, that I ever do. There’s plays in the game that are not called very good they’re bad calls at a bad time I want to take ownership for that. There’s plays that a player doesn’t make and they need to take ownership for that. I think as a foot-ball team if everybody accepts their own responsibility then now you’ve got a team.”
Rumors have swirled about Mus-
champ dipping his hand in the of-fensive playcalling. Roper trumped that notion instantly.
“Not true. Not true,” Roper said. 
“In my experience, absolutely none of it’s true. You know when we got here it was completely, ‘Hey do it how you best see ﬁ  t.’ And he doesn’t 
call plays.”
Roper probably didn’t anticipate 
that his tenure at Florida could end 
after one season. 
But if that situation arises, he said 
he doesn’t have any regrets.
“Working for Will Muschamp 
is unbelievable,” Roper said. “Ev-erything you’re hearing about him 
is not just people blowing smoke. 
That’s a good person No. 1. and I learned a lot of football from him. I really did.”
After arriving in Gainesville just 
10 months ago, Roper may be on the move again. But that talk will come later. For now, he’s worried about the present.
“Shoot, we love it here,” Roper 
said. “Everybody’s been great to us. It’s a great place. It’s a great place to live, great place to coach, great place to be around. Everyone’s been great, so we’ll miss it. But you look back at that later on. Two more weeks of grind. The grind hasn’t stopped.”

◗ MANY PROJECT THE JUNIOR 
AS A FIRST-ROUND DRAFT PICK.
JONATHAN CZUPRYN
Alligator Staff Writer @jczupryn
Will Muschamp will sit down with 
Dante Fowler Jr. and his family “at an 
appropriate time” regarding the junior’s option to enter the NFL Draft.
However, Muschamp may have 
given Fowler the answer to his dilemma about four months ago during the South-eastern Conference Media Days in July, 
“My philosophy, if he’s going to be 
a ﬁ  rst-round pick, he needs to pack his bag and go,” Muschamp said. “If you’re not going to be a ﬁ  rst-round pick, you can come back and improve yourself 
your senior year.  If you can come back 
and improve yourself your senior year, if you’re willing to work to do the things you need to do to improve yourself, you need to come back.”
Although the NFL Draft is more than 
ﬁ  ve months away, several draft experts have already pinned the 6-foot-3, 270-pound Fowler as a ﬁ  rst-round pick be-
cause of his instinctual ability to rush the 
quarterback.
And now that he won’t have his head 
coach return to Florida for 2015, Fowler took to Twitter to make a statement.Fowler takes to Twitter, says 
he’s leaving after this season
SEE COLUMN, PAGE 15SEE FOWLER, PAGE 15In the long run, Angel Rodriguez may be 
one of the better things to happen to the Gators this season.
He told coach Jim Larrananga he wanted 
the ball in the ﬁ  nal timeout called by the Hur-
ricanes, a 30-second reprieve with his team down two points in a hostile environment. 
Teams often expend all their energy com-
ing back that they don’t often have enough to 
get over the hump, but that was not the case 
Monday. 
Miami ripped off a torrid 18-1 run in the 
second half to help overcome a 15-point deﬁ  -cit. The lead changed ﬁ  ve times in the last 1:55 as the Hurricanes tried to wrestle the game away. 
And in the end, they did.
Florida starts strong, but trails off in games 
this season.
Billy Donovan isn’t sure why, but he did 
say that his team needed to learn how to win 
and how to deal with losing. 
Including its exhibition victory against Barry, Florida’s of-fense scores 1.21 points in three ﬁ  rst halves played.  In second halves? 
Only .869. 
As the Gators 
fell off, Rodriguez 
heated up.
This isn’t the ﬁ  rst 
time Rodriguez has played on a team that has beaten Florida. 
The Kansas State transfer was a member 
of the 2012 Wildcats team that defeated the Gators in Sunrise.  In that game, he scored four points. 
Monday night was a much different story.He had two points at halftime on 1-of-5 
shooting, but thanks to the faith of his team-mates, he kept letting it ﬂ  y, and scored 22 of his game-high 24 in the second half.

Alligator Writer @LFTorresIII
J.C. Deacon has accomplished a lot in his 
first season as the coach for the Florida men’s 
golf team.
He made his coaching debut in the first 
tournament of the year. He guided the Gators 
to two second place finishes in the fall and saw 
junior A.J. Crouch capture his first individual title at the Florida Gulf Coast Invitational.
And now he’s signed his first full-fledged 
recruiting class to national letters of intent at UF.
The four-man class includes Blake Dyer 
out of St. Petersburg High School, Jorge Gar-cia of American Heritage School in Plantation, 
Sam Horsfield out of Ridge Community High School in Davenport and Kyler Tate of West 
Orange High School in Orlando.   
“I think this is by far, the most well rounded 
signing class I’ve ever been a part of,” Deacon said in a release. “This is the class that is going to lead the new era of Gator Golf, and we’re in great hands with these guys.”
Headlining the class is Garcia, who is 
ranked No. 3 by Golfweek in its junior rank-ings. Garcia is a two-time First-team Rolex Junior All-American and also captured the South American Junior Championship in 2013 
and 2014.
The rest of the class doesn’t fall far be-
hind Garcia. Horsfield would’ve been the top 
ranked junior golfer in the world, but he didn’t compete in enough tournaments to qualify for Golfweek’s top spot.Horsfield, who Deacon calls “an overnight 
program changer,” won the 2014 AJGA Junior PLAYERS Championship. He also won the 
2013 Florida State Amateur by 11 strokes to in 
route to becoming the youngest winner of the event in 96 years.
Tate placed second at the 2014 FHSAA 
State Championship and won the 2014 KPMG Stacy Lewis Junior Open. He was an Honor-
able Mention Rolex Junior All-American in 
2014 as well.Rounding out the class is Dyer, who is a 
legacy recruit as his father competed for the Gators from 1984-88 and was Academic All-
Southeastern Conference in 1985. Dyer won 
the 2014 Sam Parks Invitational and was named the 2013 Pinellas County High School Player and Conference Player of the Year.    
The first full recruiting class for a coach is 
crucial for a program’s success in the future. Deacon knows the future is looking bright with the amount of talent that will be injected into the program.
“They’re hard workers, they love the game 
and they’re very, very close with each other,” Deacon said. 
“They’ve already built strong friendships 
and they’re all really proud Gators, so Florida golf is in great hands right now.” Florida men’s golf brings in four-man recruiting class
“I think this is by far, the most 
well rounded signing class I’ve ever 
been a part of.”

After getting back to its 
winning ways on Sunday, 
Florida is looking forward to 
carrying that momentum for-
ward into the later stages of the NCAA Tournament.
The No. 2-seeded Gators’ 
victory over the Mercer Bears was Florida’s first game since losing to Tennessee in the first round of the Southeastern Conference Tournament on 
Nov. 5. The Gators were intent 
on using their time off to im-prove themselves and re-focus in order to come back strong 
for the NCAA Tournament. 
They got off to a good start on Sunday.
Florida scored three goals 
against Mercer and shut the 
Bears out 3-0. The Gators’ of-
fense was clicking, but so was the defense, which is what coach Becky Burleigh said was 
an improvement from their 
loss against Tennessee. Flori-da gave up just three shots to Mercer on Sunday.
“I thought we did a bet-
ter job of team defending, I thought we were a little bit more disciplined in terms of our organization in the back,” 
Burleigh said. “I think Mer-
cer had two relatively good chances…so I felt like we lim-ited them offensively.”
With the win on Sunday, 
the Gators are regaining their confidence, that is, if they ever really lost it. 
Sophomore Savannah 
Jordan put up Jordan-like numbers against Mercer with seven shots and two goals. Se-nior Taylor Burke earned her 27th career solo shutout, tying 
her with Katie Fraine for the Gators’ record. And the Flor-
ida bench was able to provide steady support throughout the match with one shot and two 
assists coming from the eight 
players who substituted in.
It was a classic Florida 
soccer performance, and the 
Gators want to keep that level 
of play rolling into their sec-ond round game on Friday, because Friday’s game is the only one the team is focusing 
on.
In tournaments like these, 
it’s easy to get excited about the 
possibility of making a deep 
run, but Florida isn’t thinking 
like that. It’s only focusing on one thing: the second game in the NCAA Tournament.
“When you’re playing in 
these situations where it’s re-
ally a one game season, one 
game at a time, I don’t find it difficult at all to focus on that one game,” Burleigh said, “be-cause you know that that’s all 
that you’re guaranteed.”
If the Gators were to win 
on Friday night against the California Bears, they would 
play again on Sunday against the winner of the Auburn-Tex-as Tech matchup, but Florida 
isn’t thinking like that. It’s tak-
ing this tournament just like it took the whole regular season, one game at a time.
“We’ve been kind of hav-
ing that approach throughout the whole season, we have this mentality that every game is a championship game,” Bur-
leigh said. “For us it’s all about 
being present in the moment for the game that we’re in and the moment that we’re in…it’s really important to be in 
the moment of the game that 
you’re in.”Strong first round to

No. 8 Florida has a lot it can 
learn after falling to unranked 
Miami 69-67 on Monday. 
One challenge the Gators (1-1) 
faced is its shorthanded roster, with three players out of commis-sion against the Hurricanes (2-0).
Sophomore Dillon Graham is 
no longer available to the Gators since he’s opted to transfer. 
Redshirt junior forward 
Dorian Finney-Smith is nursing 
two hairline fractures in his left 
hand and sophomore forward Chris Walker sat out for the last of his three-game suspension.
“I was really proud of our 
guys being so shorthanded,” coach Billy Donovan said. “Espe-cially in the frontcourt where we really had to play some kind of 
makeshift lineups.”
But Walker’s return will give 
Florida a more familiar look in its lineup on Friday against Louisi-ana-Monroe.
“I thought we really played 
great defense in the first half. 
Guys did a really good job,” 
Donovan said. “You can’t give up 
what we gave up in the second half.”
Donovan doesn’t have much 
time to work with Florida before 
it heads into the Battle for Atlan-
tis Tournament during Thanks-giving Break. The Gators could face top-ranked opponents such 
as No. 3 Wisconsin, No. 6 North 
Carolina and Georgetown in the tournament. 
“Our defense was not at the 
level that it needed to be, and 
how much of that was fatigue, I 
can’t put my finger on it,” Don-ovan said. “ I don’t know if the right word is lazy, or careless, or 
easy way out. I don’t know how 
we could do it in the first half, not do it in the second half, and that’s why I think fatigue was poten-tially a factor.”
Whatever the common de-
nominator was, it’s been a con-sistent presence in Florida’s per-formance. Including Florida’s exhibition against Barry, the Gators have averaged 1.21 points 
per possession in the first half of 
games.
But in the second half, that 
number drops to 0.869 points per 
possession.
Transfer center Jon Horford 
offers Florida some leadership 
where it’s lacking. With three seasons at Michigan, one as team 
captain, Horford has experienced 
early season growing pains in his career.
“Guys have to get over it quick-
ly and get on to the next (one). We have to listen to the coaches, they know what they are talking about and have a lot of great teaching points,” Horford said. “It’s the 
beginning of the season, (we will) 
keep getting better every day and everything will work out”.Gators have room to improve after loss

minutes.
But his final three were the most 
impactful.
As fatigue wilted Florida, Ro-
driguez caught fire. 
Donovan hoped this game 
could teach his team how to win, 
like Shabazz Napier’s basket at the buzzer last season for Connecticut. 
Donovan hopes another dag-
ger shot at the end of the game will serve as a similar teaching point. 
Only time will tell if that is the 
case, though.
There is so much unproven 
about this team, so much newness to them. 
Can Eli Carter continue to be 
the alpha-male offensively? At this point, he seems to be the only player that can consistently create his own shot. 
What happens when Chris 
Walker comes back? Will chemis-try be broken, and how much less 
raw will he be than when we last 
saw him on the court?
What can Alex Murphy contrib-
ute? That’s a question we won’t have an answer to until January, and even then it will take him some time to gel as well. 
Can Jon Horford be relied upon 
as a consistent low post presence? How will he gel with Walker? And 
will we see more three pointers 
from him? 
I’d imagine it’s things like that 
that keep Billy Donovan up at night. What the hell is this team going to be with so many moving parts, with so few proven com-modities.
It’s November. The sky is not 
falling after a loss in the second of-ficial game of the season, but peo-ple are impatient and I just listed a whole bunch of questions that will 
probably be answered later rather 
than sooner. 
Maybe Angel’s dagger three pointer doesn’t lead to answers or profound soul searching that leads 
a group of talented Gators to find 
what it takes to win like their head coach so desperately wants. Maybe they’ll go through more 
heartbreaking performances in the 
Bahamas next week and in Kansas 
at the beginning of next month. 
Maybe they’ll get beat up and bruised down low by a physical front court in conference play and 
get outclassed by a Kentucky squad 
that’s all the rage yet again.
Or maybe they won’t.“I came with champ. I’m leaving with Him,” Fowler posted 
on his account (@TheDanteFowler6).
When asked if he agreed with Mike Taylor’s sentiment 
about not wanting to play for any coach but Muschamp, Fowl-er responded, “Oh yeah, definitely.”
Fowler also admitted the constant hot-seat talk regarding 
Muschamp served as an unwanted disturbance in Florida’s locker room. 
With the attention that the new head coach will receive 
throughout the offseason and into the 2015 campaign, it would be surprising to see Fowler willingly step back into that media circus.
“There was just a lot of drama going on, you know, just 
through Champ there and things like that,” Fowler said. “I feel like everybody wanting him to leave so bad that it kind of 
turned into a distraction.”
Then when asked what scenario, if any, would entice him to 
return for a senior campaign, Fowler had to pause and ponder 
before delivering his answer.
“Just, if anything, probably just develop or if they was to say 
I was too young or something like that,” he said.
Fowler, who would turn 21 before the start of the next NFL 
season, doesn’t have much left to develop on the field. The ju-nior is tied for second on the Gators in total tackles and first in 
tackles for loss with eight.
And Fowler also leads the team with 15 quarterback hur-
ries. No other Gator has more than seven.
If he were to enter the draft early and get selected in the first 
round, Fowler would become the fourth UF player drafted in 
the top-32 over the past three years. 
Dominique Easley, who is a good friend and mentor to 
Fowler, was the last Gator to go in the first round when he was selected 29th overall by the New England Patriots.WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 19, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15

The College Football Playoff committee released 
its fourth top 25 rankings on Tuesday evening, 
and there were some surprises within the top four. 
Let’s breakdown the committee’s top four, and 
analyze the teams on the outside looking in.
Top Four: 
No. 1 Alabama Crimson Tide: Alabama 
moved from No. 5 to the top spot after de-
feating one of the few undefeated teams in the country left — then-No. 1 Mississippi 
State. Alabama went in at halftime with a 
19-3 lead, but Mississippi State was able to score 17 points in the second half to cut Ala-bama’s margin of victory to just 25-20. Ala-
bama’s only loss was to Ole Miss on the road 
early in October.  
No. 2 Oregon Ducks: The Ducks kept their 
No. 2 ranking during its bye last week. Ore-
gon has had big, impressive wins this month 
against Stanford and Utah on the road. They currently lead the Pac-12 North standings and look to be the favorites to win out as Pac-
12 champions.  
No. 3 Florida State Seminoles: Florida State 
had another come-from-behind victory on 
the road against an unranked Miami team 
last week. The Seminoles were down as 
much as 23-7 early in the second quarter, but scored 20 points in the second half, includ-ing a late touchdown in the fourth quarter to 
put the Hurricanes away. Although Florida 
State is the only undefeated team left in the entire top 25, the committee still kept FSU in 
the third spot.
No. 4 Mississippi State Bulldogs:  Since Mis-
sissippi State’s one loss was suffered to Ala-
bama just last week, the committee still felt 
they were worthy of being part of the top 
four teams in the country. The Bulldogs did themselves a favor to come back in the sec-ond half and only lose to the Crimson Tide by 
five points, too. Mississippi State has beaten 
just one remaining top 25 team on their re-sume, defeating Auburn 38-23 last month.  
Teams on the Outside: 
No. 5 TCU Horned Frogs: TCU dropped 
out of the top four following a four-point win 
over Kansas where the Horned Frogs were 
down 10 points midway through the third 
quarter. Kansas has won just three games on the year. If TCU continues to win out, how-
ever, it might make the case to be in the top 
four.
No. 6 Ohio State Buckeyes: Although some 
speculated that one-loss Ohio State would make the top four, the committee kept them at six. The Buckeyes’ one loss came against a bad Virginia Tech team in Week 2 of the sea-son. They have two top 25 road wins in the 
last two weeks — against No. 12 Michigan 
State and No. 25 Minnesota last Saturday. If they win out, which would include winning 
the Big Ten Conference, the Buckeyes could 
jump into the top four. 
No. 7 Baylor Bears: One of the more contro-
versial left out teams continues once again to be Baylor. Its one loss came against West Vir-ginia, but it did beat TCU last month. Despite the committee’s usage of head-to-head match ups as a determining factor, the committee 
still believes TCU’s body of work is more im-
pressive than Baylor’s.16, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 19, 2014
