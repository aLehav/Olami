LSU 30 FLORIDA 27
MORGAN MORIARTY
Alligator Staff Writer @Morgan_Moriarty
It was an up and down week 
for Florida fans. 
Monday morning, they woke 
up with a sense of hope. 
The Gators went into Knox-
ville, Tennessee, and pulled 
out an ugly 10-9 win, helped by 
backup true freshman quarter-
back Treon Harris coming in for starter Jeff Driskel late in the third quarter. 
But around noon on Monday, 
the mood went south quickly as it was reported that Harris, who gave Florida a much-needed spark on offense, was under in-
vestigation for an alleged sexual  
case that occurred early Sunday morning at UF’s Springs Resi-
dential Complex. 
Harris was suspended indeﬁ  -
nitely from the football team, and 
for the majority of the week opin-ions varied.
On Friday afternoon, Harris’ 
accuser withdrew her complaint, and Harris was reinstated to the team a few hours after. Head 
coach Will Muschamp announced 
Friday he would still not play on Saturday. 
Despite all the off the ﬁ  eld is-sues surrounding the program 
throughout the week, there was 
still a big game looming Saturday night against the LSU Tigers.
Much like the week leading up 
to Saturday evening in Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium, the game was 
just as back and forth. 
Five lead changes, inconsisten-
cies and turnovers caused Florida 
to have a slew of missed oppor-
tunities. Jeff Driskel’s two intercep-
tions.
Tight end Tevin Westbrook’s 
drop in the end zone.
And the secondary’s miscom-
munication.
All of them compounded and 
resulted in UF (3-2, 2-2 South-
eastern Conference) falling 30-27 to LSU (5-2, 1-2 SEC) on Satur-
day night at Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Sta-
dium.
A frustrated Will Muschamp 
entered in front of the podium 
post game with a long-winded 
sigh, and a face of obvious cha-grin and disappointment.
“Turnovers killed us, espe-
cially early in the game when we 
gave them a freebie,” the fourth-
year head coach said. “They did a good job running the football with the drive in the third quarter 
and were able to stay on the ﬁ  eld 
during third downs. We weren’t able to get off the ﬁ  eld and then we didn’t maintain drives offen-sively.” 
The plays were there, but Flor-
ida failed to execute.
Driskel’s turnover issues con-
tinued on Saturday — he fumbled 
midway through the ﬁ  rst quarter 
and threw an interception early in the second quarter.

UF’s College of Education has re-
ceived the largest donation from an 
alumni in its history.
Anita Zucker, an alumna from the 
College of Education, donated $5 million 
to the college to enhance early childhood 
development and learning experience programs.  
UF’s Center for Excellence in Early 
Childhood Studies will now be called the Anita Zucker Center for Excellence in Early Childhood Studies in honor of Zucker’s donation.
“This gift will ensure that the center will be endowed and will exist in UF forever,” said Patricia Snyder, director of the UF Anita Zucker Center for Excel-lence in Early Childhood Studies.
Zucker has worked with children 
since she was 12 years old. She received 
a bachelor’s degree in education from 
UF and taught English and social studies to elementary school children in Florida and South Carolina for 11 years.
She later became the CEO of the Hud-
son Bay Co. and head of the InterTech Group after her husband, Jerry, passed away.

About 127 people were either arrested or 
ejected from the UF vs. Louisiana State Uni-
versity football game Saturday night — 13 
more than the last LSU home game in 2012.
Out of the 118 people who were ejected, 
49 were UF students. Seventeen of the ejec-
tions were made for possession of alcohol, 
along with 28 for disorderly conduct, 22 for 
intoxication, 16 for ticket switching, 12 for sitting in the wrong section, 13 for not hav-ing a ticket and 10 for smoking.
Nine people were arrested — the most 
since the 12 arrests made at the 2012 Uni-versity of South Carolina home game Oct. 20.
Three arrests were UF students. One 
was for alcohol possession, one for disor-derly conduct and one for battery. Six were charged with trespassing after warning.
Since the beginning of this football sea-
son, the number of gameday arrests and ejec-
tions has increased. At the canceled home 
opener against the University of Idaho on Aug. 30, there were 25 arrests and ejections total, while 98 people were either arrested 
or ejected at UF’s SEC home opener against 
the University of Kentucky on Sept. 13.
Saturday’s game came just 35 incidents 
shy of the 158 ejections and four arrests made at last year’s Florida State University 
home game.118 ejected, 9 arrested at game

Our Robotic Future: A talk by 
Evan SelingerEvan Selinger from the 
Rochester Institute of 
Technology will explore how 
Americans are increasingly 
outsourcing intimate emo-
tional labor to service pro-
viders like elder caretakers, 
love coaches and wedding 
planners, as well as tools like 
smartphones and self-driving 
cars. He will question the 
problematic, even tragic, re-
sults of this reliance, such as 
distorted family values and 
declining civic life. As we be-come increasingly dependent 
upon electronic devices, we 
may fall into what Selinger terms the “outsourcing illu-
sion” or become submissive to 
technology, instead of using it 
to improve our lives. His lec-
ture will take place today in Smathers Library, Room 100 
at 5:30 p.m.

Two people tried to cross 
West University Avenue toward 
UF’s campus late Friday night before police said they were struck by an eastbound vehicle near The Swamp Restaurant.
The traffic light was not red 
when the man and woman walked into the street, and evidence suggests they both smashed into the oncoming ve-hicle’s windshield before land-ing on the roadway, according to a report.
Gainesville Police spokes-
man Officer Ben Tobias said the woman was conscious and alert with obvious head injuries at the scene. Large amounts of blood pooled from the back of the man’s head as he gradually lost consciousness.
UF Health Shands Hospital 
reported to police that both pe-destrians were stable and likely to be OK.
After the victims were trans-
ported to the hospital, the Ford Focus with a shattered wind-shield illuminated a small pud-dle of blood with its headlights.

Leaders of UF and the chemistry depart-
ment put on their hard hats and brought out 
their shovels to break ground on the new Chemistry/Chemical Biology Building on Fri-day morning.
The building, which will be situated at 
Buckman Drive and West University Avenue, will feature four floors dedicated to chemistry studies.
The first two floors will hold undergradu-
ate studies and classrooms for lower-level chemistry classes. Two of the floors will house state-of-the-art labs for faculty and graduate students working in chemical biology and 
chemical synthesis.
“This new building will make the chemis-
try program much more attractive to graduate 
students and professors,” said William Dol-bier, chairman of the chemistry department. 
Construction on the 110,000 square-foot 
building is expected to be completed in May of 2016. It will cost about $67 million to build, and about $42 million of which has been com-mitted by the state of Florida.
At the event, Bernie Machen said the build-
ing will help UF take another step forward. 
This building will be the fourth chemistry 
building at UF.
Leigh Hall, where most of the general 
chemistry courses are taught, was built in 1927. Dolbier said this new building is a long time coming. The current chemistry labs  were designed for six students but are holding about 21 students, he said.
“Freshmen would come here and think, 
‘this is worse than my high school,’ and would be turned away from pursuing chemistry here,” he said, “but now, this will open their eyes and let them see chemistry at its best.”
Forty percent of the incoming freshman 
class is taking general chemistry classes, said Cory Yeffet, UF Student Body president.
Chemistry is required for engineering, bi-
ology and medicine students. Dolbier said he 
thinks this new building will allow for more 
collaborations between the College of Medi-cine and the College of Engineering.
“You can’t have a top 10 university without 
a top chemistry department,” Dolbier said.
state I live in (South Carolina) 
is the youngest children are the most ignored and the most suf-fering and the most living in poverty, so the opportunities 
are great to make a difference 
in the lives of young children,” she said.
Zucker’s donation will be 
combined with another $5 mil-lion in preeminence support from the university.
Zucker said she is glad to 
give back to her former college.
“I’m just honored to be a 
Gator,” she said.
The center is housed in the 
College of Education and will collaborate with other colleges on campus such as the Col-lege of Medicine, the College of Public Health and Health Professions, and the College of Nursing.
The center will also collabo-rate with research centers, such as the Baby Gator Child Devel-opment Center and the UF In-stitute for Child Health Policy.
“It’s bigger than just the Col-
lege of Education, it’s bringing together people interested in early child issues from birth 
to 5 years old,”  said Maureen 
Conroy, co-director of UF Anita Zucker Center for Excellence in Early Childhood Studies.
Other faculty members in 
the College of Education, such as professor Mary Brownell, 
said it’s important when a do-
nor is interested in improving early supports for children.
“I wish more individuals 
interested in financially sup-porting the university would consider the importance of sup-porting the College’s efforts to improve teaching and research 
on teaching, particularly for 
those populations of students that are most vulnerable, such as students with disabilities,” she wrote in an email.4, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, OCTOBER 13, 2014

A UF alumnus challenged him-
self to a 156-mile bike ride along the 
east coast to support a cause he said 
does not get enough attention.
Stephen Fitzmaurice, a UF alum-
nus, completed a three-day bike ride 
through four states, from Maryland 
to Washington, D.C., with the Gears 
for Good charity bike ride to raise money for the Hemophilia Federa-tion of America.
Fitzmaurice, 27, said he had both 
personal and professional reasons for making the trip from Sept. 26 to Sept. 28.
“Hemophilia is like the under-
dog medical group,” he said. “A lot of folks don’t know about bleeding disorders and how to treat them, so it really spoke to me.”
He said he also wanted push 
himself and take on the bike trail, along with 25 other riders.
Fitzmaurice raised $1,295 out 
of the more than $90,000 raised by the charity. One hundred percent of the donations go to patients and their families to pay for medical ex-penses.
Hemophilia, a rare genetic bleed-
ing disorder, affects only 20,000 people in the U.S., according to the 
Hemophilia Federation of America 
website.
The disorder can cause inter-
nal or external bleeding episodes, affecting the joints, muscles and 
abdomen. There is no cure for it, 
and treatment typically costs about $350,000 a year.
“Hemophilia is not only physi-
cally and emotionally painful, it can be financially challenging,” said Al-lie Boutin, Hemophilia Federation of America development coordinator, in a press release. “I am proud to or-
ganize this fundraiser to help moms 
and dads who have lost their jobs or paychecks because they stayed in the hospital with their children.”
Fitzmaurice, who now works 
with nonprofit organizations in Washington, D.C., said he enjoyed working with Gears for Good to help change lives.
“It was really cool for me to meet 
community members during the bike ride,” Fitzmaurice said. “You’re 
meeting folks that have hemophilia 
and that have different experiences with types of treatment.”
Some of the people he met along 
the way contracted HIV and hepati-
tis C throughout their years with the 
disorder from various blood trans-fusions in the 1950s and 1960s.
Fitzmaurice said his involvement 
was a once-in-a-lifetime experience.
“It was my first time doing any-
thing like this,” he said. “The pro-gram, Gears for Good, really spoke to me, and I enjoyed helping these 
people out. They’re just inspiring.”

Paul Myers, administrator of the 
Florida Department of Health in 
Alachua County, is taking his talents to Tallahassee.
Myers began his temporary posi-
tion as interim deputy secretary for statewide services at the Florida De-partment of Health on Oct. 1.
The UF alumnus started working 
for the Alachua County department after graduation. An advertisement in The Gainesville Sun prompted him to apply for a position as an en-vironmental health inspector.
On a Friday the 13th in May 1988, 
he got the job. He hasn’t left since.
“It’s fascinating to me that 26 
years have gone by,” Myers said. “If you had told me when I was hired that I would have been here 26 years later, I would have looked at you and probably smiled.”
Myers has taken many posts 
since 1988, working as an environ-mental supervisor, environmental health and epidemiology director, assistant administrator and overall administrator — the position he has held since 2012.
Myers will split his time between 
Gainesville and Tallahassee until 
Dec. 31, when a permanent deputy 
secretary or another interim deputy 
secretary will be hired.
He welcomes the new challenge 
of overseeing all 67 counties in Flor-
ida, he said.
Myers will also be responsible 
for overseeing the Division of Public 
Health Statistics and Performance Management. He takes over for C. Meade Grigg, who is retiring.
“In life, if you ever stop growing, I really believe you start to die,” My-ers said. “This was an opportunity to grow and to learn and to contrib-ute, and that appealed to me.”
Tom Belcuore, former adminis-
trator of the Florida Department of Health in Alachua County from 1984 
to 2008, said he knew Myers would 
go far in the department from the moment he met him.
“We were very lucky that he de-
cided to come to Alachua County Health Department when he did,” Belcoure said. “He certainly made my life a lot easier.”
Belcoure praised Myers’ ability 
to work with others and his com-petitive drive to take on projects and perform at his best — qualities he said will suit Myers well in his new position.
When his term ends, Myers said 
he has no intention of applying for the permanent position.
“I have no ambition to leave Ala-
chua County,” he said.UF alumnus becomes interim FL

Alumni can get up and give all 
throughout the week as part of an 
annual Homecoming tradition.  
For its fourth year, the Get Up 
and Give campaign is once again urging alumni to donate to UF’s campus-wide projects.
Alumni can donate to more 
than 20 projects hosted by each college until Friday.
“It’s a nice way for alumni to 
look back to Homecoming in the past while helping UF in the fu-ture,” said Heather Duiser, asso-ciate director of Annual Giving at 
the UF Foundation.
Whether it’s donating to grad-
uate school scholarships for the 
College of Education or a mission 
trip to Mexico for the College of Nursing, alumni have the oppor-tunity to give money to causes 
they want to support.
“Alumni are able to pick what 
they’re passionate about, and that’s what we want them to do-
nate to,” Duiser said.
Last year, Get Up and Give 
raised more than $60,000.
About 80 percent of the uni-
versity’s budget comes from pri-vate donations, whether it’s from 
alumni or corporations, Duiser said.
The projects that received the 
most donations last year included the Machen Florida Opportunity Scholars Program, the Alumni As-sociation Membership Drive and Dance Marathon at UF.
“Get Up and Give is an incred-
ible initiative on behalf of the University of Florida to engage all alumni, and we are proud to partner with them to continue to raise funds and awareness ‘For 
the Kids,’” said Taylor Chambers, 
the overall director of Dance Mar-athon at UF.
UF’s social media accounts will

Three Gainesville residents were arrested Friday 
after an attempted drug deal.
Leon Perry, 65, tried to buy prescription narcotic 
pain pills from Keith Torres, 39, and Brittany Miller, 
24, according to a report. When the two parties met 
up Thursday night, Perry handed Miller — who 
was in a car with Torres — $2,300 in cash. Miller and Torres then sped off without giving the drugs to Perry.
Perry proceeded to chase Miller and Torres in 
his car. He then called police, who located the vehi-cle chase. Torres, Miller and Perry were all stopped by Gainesville Police at 1100 NE Eighth Ave. early Friday morning. The cash was found in Torres’ car 
and seized for forfeiture.
Both Torres and Miller were arrested on charges 
of grand theft and both have bonds set at $10,000. 
Perry was arrested on charges of conspiracy to pur-chase a controlled substance. He was released Fri-day on his own recognizance.

Two Gainesville men were arrested Friday after 
police said they found containers of crack cocaine 
following a traffic stop. 
Anthony Albert Allen, 38, was initially pulled 
over at 3500 SW 27th St. for a license plate light vio-
lation, a report said. When officers stopped Allen, his passenger — Dario Miller Veale, 22, — quickly got out of the car, fled on foot and lost an Adidas shoe.
A report said officers found a container with one 
gram of crack cocaine near the shoe they retrieved. 
Officers also found 12 small bags of white powder suggestively packaged for sale, but the powder did 
not test positive for a controlled substance. Law enforcement are still conducting tests on what the 
powdery material was.
When police searched Allen’s vehicle, they 
found a pill bottle in the center cup holder with four 
grams of cocaine. Another small plastic bag with more white powder was found in the car, but it also did not test positive for a controlled substance.
Allen was arrested on charges of cocaine pos-
session with intent to sell and for driving with a suspended license. His bond is currently set at 
$252,500. Veale was arrested on charges of cocaine 
possession with intent to sell and for resisting of-
ficers. His bond is currently set at $29,000.

A Gainesville woman was arrested Saturday af-
ter police said she swung a steak knife at a man she had a sexual relationship with.
Shortly before 5 p.m., Vera Yvonne Mathews got 
into an argument with the victim in the living room of her home at 501 SE 18th St., a report said. Follow-ing the fight, the 58-year-old went and grabbed a 4-inch-long knife from the kitchen. She then swung 
the knife at the victim’s face.
The victim got a 2-inch cut on the palm of his 
hand after he raised his hands in an effort to pro-
tect himself. Police found the blood-covered knife Mathews used to cut the victim in the kitchen.
Both Mathews and the victim admitted to hav-
ing sexual relations for the past several months, but Mathews denied ever trying to injure the victim with a knife.
Mathews was arrested on charges of aggravated 
battery. Her bond is currently set at $50,000.Police roundup: Botched drug deal;

� SHE BEGAN HER CAREER 
AT SANTA FE AT AGE 17.

Bennye Alligood started 
working at Santa Fe College as 
a 17-year-old student, just two years after the college was first established in 1965.
Her early part-time job in 
audio-visual equipment delivery launched her 35-year career at Santa Fe, where she retired last week as associate vice president for educational centers, having enrolled about 24,000 students, according to a press release.
A send-off party with Santa 
Fe staff Friday marked the end of Alligood’s service.
Described by those who 
worked with her as joyful and 
a natural leader, Alligood was 
“friendly and extraordinarily ar-ticulate about the mission of the college” and “made everyone feel welcomed and valued,” said Ed-ward Bonahue, the college’s aca-demic affairs provost.
At the retirement party, Bo-
nahue said Alligood “has brought 
memory of what the college has 
been and also an inspiring vision of what the college should be and will continue to be.”Following a 
10-year hiatus after moving with her hus-band to Geor-gia, Alligood 
returned to the 
college and was named the ad-ministrative as-
sistant to former academic affairs vice president Robert Myers, ac-cording to the release.
“Bennye represents the very 
best of what Santa Fe is, was and 
sure will ever be,” said Myers.
Working at Santa Fe “was nev-
er a job for Bennye, it was a call-
ing,” he said.Cheryl Farrell said taking 
care of people was in Alligood’s nature. The executive assistant for the college’s assessment, re-search, and technology depart-ment worked with Alligood for 
five years.
“She’s very genuine. She’s 
very open,” Farrell said. “She 
definitely has an open door pol-icy. She was never too busy for anyone.”
Santa Fe President Jackson 
Sasser said he valued Alligood during their time as colleagues.
“Every major decision that 
I’ve made for this college for the last 12 years, she has been con-sulted,” he  said.When asked if she was sad 
about leaving Santa Fe, Alligood said, “More than you can imag-ine. It’s been a great part of my life. I’ve been here almost from the beginning.”
When Alligood started her 
more than three-decade career, she said Santa Fe was housed just seven blocks from UF’s campus.
“Everybody said, ‘Why do 
you want to have a college right next to the University of Florida? It just won’t even be successful,’” she said.
Nearly 50 years later, Santa Fe 
is ranked by the Aspen Institute as one of the top 10 community colleges nationwide.
Santa Fe College associate vice president retires after 35 years“It’s a nice way for alumni 
to look back to Homecoming 
in the past while helping UF 
in the future.”

munity gardens? Today’s question: Are you worried about the Snapchat 
leak?‘Dropped complaint’ vs. ‘false accusation’
By now, we’ve all heard about the sexual assault complaint that was ﬁ  led against UF football player Treon Harris last week and later dropped by the ac-
cuser. 
We’ll never know why the complaint was dropped — 
whether the accuser decided to drop the charges because her allegations were false or if she was pressured into drop-ping true allegations. The truth of the matter will remain unknown unless either party clears the air for the public or further investigation causes new facts to emerge.
In the immediate aftermath of the allegations against 
Harris, UF students and the national media praised uni-versity administrators for their quick suspension of Har-ris. Commentators expressed pride and satisfaction that the institution was prioritizing students’ safety and well-being over reputation and a successful football season.
The conversation took a nasty turn on Friday, though, 
with the announcement that the complaint had been dropped. The public began to strike up a harmful dis-course that sought to condemn the accuser of falsely ac-cusing Harris of sexual assault.
For example, one Facebook status from a UF student 
that found its way onto my news feed said that because of her indecisive act of ﬁ  ling and then dropping charges, the accuser was probably “asking for it.”
It’s disturbing that, in the wake of UF’s ﬁ  rst ever Sexual 
Assault Awareness Week, there are still people walking this campus who think any woman at any time could be asking for her own assault.
As former Alligator Sports Editor Adam Lichtenstein 
wrote in an online blog post, we have to dig deeper to understand why victims of sexual assault do not report crimes against them or decide not to follow through with complaints they do ﬁ  le.
Rape culture is an ugly feature of our society that stems 
from misogyny and can keep victims fearful of coming forward. The risk of having your entire sexual history ex-plored daunts many people from even reporting their assaults. The questioning of one’s character that happens after someone re-ports an assault can be a trauma-tizing time as well: Being asked questions that serve to establish whether they were asking for it can lead many people to drop 
charges in a desperate attempt of self-preservation.
The next time you hear about charges being dropped, 
understand that a complaint being dropped is not synony-mous with a false accusation. The two are very different, and there are several complicated reasons — all of which relate to the stigma surrounding sexual assault fostered within American society — that might explain why a per-son would drop charges, even if they are true.
It’s not OK to make false allegations against anyone, 
especially of sexual assault. Accusing someone of sexual assault can hurt their credibility tremendously and have negative long-term effects on their reputation. I’m not advocating for the swift incarceration of anyone who has sexual assault charges brought against them because false accusations do occur.
What I’m pushing for is an end to discussions that paint 
accusers as people who were asking for it. Let’s clear up one thing right now: No person is asking to be assaulted or abused. Ever.
It doesn’t matter what clothes they were wearing, or if 
they had been drinking, or if they have a large list of past sexual partners.
The effort many have spent trying to paint the accus-
er as someone who had it coming would be much better spent trying to prevent and discourage acts of sexual as-sault that are still ubiquitous in our society.
TehQuin Forbes is a UF sociology junior. His column ap-
pears on Mondays.Florida public    
records fees must 
be kept in check
In the technological age of the 21st century, access to public 
records and information should be a fairly straightforward and efﬁ  cient process. Unfortunately, in Florida, the methods 
of obtaining public information are anything but.
Last year, the Center for Public Integrity, a journalistic watch-
dog group, requested information from Florida’s 17th Judicial Circuit about “the procedures and policies surrounding foreclo-sure cases.”
Ofﬁ  cials from the court system informed the CPI that the 
records were available but would cost the center more than $132,000 to obtain.
According to the CPI, General Counsel Alexandra Rieman 
explained these costs by claiming that staff members would have to sort through 149,000 emails, requiring 2,500 work hours 
at a rate of $43 or $45 per hour.
That rate did not include the additional 15-cent charge per 
page for any records ultimately provided by the 17th Judicial 
Circuit. 
Unsurprisingly, the CPI refused to pay the open records fees, 
calling them “excessive.”
In another request made by the CPI on July 15 for different 
foreclosure records, court employees requested a $66,000 depos-it just to begin working. In many cases, the fees Florida charges 
for access to public records are exorbitant and absurd.
The State Integrity Investigation, a project of the CPI and two 
other organizations, Global Integrity and Public Radio Interna-
tional, gave Florida a grade of D+ in the category of “Public Ac-cess to Information.”
Although Florida ranked 18th among the 50 states for over-
all corruption risk, of which “Public Access to Information” was just one part, that was largely a result of other states being even more dysfunctional than the Sunshine State.
Florida’s overall grade was a C-, compared to 25 states that 
received a D+ or worse. No state received a grade higher than New Jersey’s B+. Florida, a state that once prided itself on its transparency and open government laws, should not simply settle for being “less bad” in these areas.
According to Barbara Petersen, president of the First Amend-
ment Foundation, an open records advocacy group, Florida law “allows an agency to charge a reasonable fee for the ‘extensive’ use of agency resources.”
If the fees on public records being charged by Florida govern-
ment are so excessive that even an open government foundation like the CPI refuses to pay them, it is clear there is a problem. If the cost of obtaining and sorting through public records is really as high as Florida government ofﬁ  cials claim, then Florida must ﬁ  nd more funds in the state budget to cover those costs. Better yet, the state should develop or utilize more advanced technolo-gy to lower costs by processing public records more efﬁ  ciently.
All Floridians deserve the right to access state records at a 
truly reasonable cost. After all, what is the point of having “pub-lic” records if they aren’t readily available to the public?MONDAY, OCTOBER 13, 2014

Last week, Twitter caught on fire after 
“That’s So Raven” star Raven-Sy-moné did an interview with Oprah 
Winfrey and said she did not want to be labeled an African-American, but rather, just an American. 
Additionally, after recently coming out of the closet, 
she also stated that she does not want to be labeled as 
“gay,” but just as “a human who loves humans.”
At first, I was perplexed by Raven’s statement.
However, after taking a moment to think about what 
she was really trying to get across, I realized my orig-
inal reaction was misguided and that Raven hit the 
nail on the head.
We should not be calling ourselves African-Amer-
icans, Asian-Americans, European-Americans or any other hyphenated form of American. We should all 
just call ourselves “Americans.”
Plenty of problems plague our nation — economic 
disparities, equality issues and race tensions — and 
they only seem to be getting worse with time.
Some may blame these complications on a different 
group, race, creed, nationality or ideology that isn’t their own, and therein lies the underlying problem — dividing ourselves and then using these divisions as a means to an end.
If you think I’m wrong, then just take a look at one 
of the most divided groups currently in America — our own Congress.
Both Democrats and Republicans are constantly 
accusing each other of destroying America, while also not getting much done and then trying to get their constituents to do the same, all with an agenda be-hind it. We end up just hating each and not moving forward.
The sensationalizing American media love this 
conflict and just add fuel to fire by feeding off the hatred flooding our news outlets with its 24 hours, seven days a week cycles.
We can’t turn on Fox News for more than 10 sec-
onds without hearing a news anchor blame the latest 
catastrophe on Democrats, nor can we turn on MSN-
BC without hearing Al Sharpton blame racism for all the nation’s woes.
The problem extends beyond political parties. The 
hatred has trickled down, and we are all starting to resent those who aren’t the same as us.
These mindsets are not healthy if we want a func-tioning society, and the only way to change things is to make a conscious ef-fort to alter our perspective.
Let’s stop hiding behind hyphen-
ations and labels.
When you attach a label to yourself, you also di-
minish your contribution to America. America is a 
nation of immigrants where we all come together to 
create something better for ourselves.
When we identify ourselves as Irish-Americans, 
German-Americans, Mexican-Americans or any other hyphenated-Americans, we isolate ourselves from the 
beauty of America and reserve part of our loyalty for 
another country.
We shouldn’t have to label ourselves as anything 
other than American.
A white, straight, Catholic man from Italy is just as 
American as a black, gay, atheist woman from South Africa, and calling ourselves anything other than American automatically begins a cycle of destructive dualism.
I am not saying that one shouldn’t be proud of who 
they are. You can be black and be proud of your cul-ture, but being black and being African-American are two very different things. The former is an identifier, 
while the latter is exclusive and divisive.
I am also not saying that people can’t be different. 
In fact, I am saying the exact opposite.
I love living in a country where we are not perse-
cuted for being who we are.
No matter what traits and lifestyles make us 
unique, we are all still Americans.
I know that we don’t live in a color-blind or preju-
dice-free society and that problems still exist among races, sexual orientations and other traits. At the same 
time, we should do everything in our power to look past these dividing characteristics.
Instead, we should focus on the fact that we are all 
Americans working together to build better lives for 
ourselves and for future generations.
It may be hard sometimes to fight the urge to di-
vide ourselves.
However, if we want to persevere and continue 
our progress, we should take Raven’s advice and just 
be proud to be Americans.

On Oct. 8, Lindsay Alexander wrote a column op-
posing the approval of Amendment 2, which would legalize medical marijuana in Florida. 
Alexander’s concerns about Amendment 2 are misguid-ed.
I have studied Amendment 2 and many other states’ 
medical marijuana legislation, and I can confidently say 
that she is mistaken about the amendment’s meaning and 
about the consequences for our state that passing Amend-
ment 2 will have.
California was the first state to pass medical mari-
juana legislation. Proposition 215 passed in 1996, and 
it was a sparse bill that provided little regulatory guid-
ance. The predictable result, as Alexander noted, was a poorly regulated system that allows virtually anyone to obtain access to marijuana.
However, much has changed in the ensuing 20 years. 
Since the passage of Prop 215, 22 other states have legal-ized medicinal marijuana. None of them have suffered the adverse consequences that California did. Florida waited patiently during that time and will benefit from 
the wisdom garnered from watching 23 diverse legisla-
tive bodies provide compassionate access to marijuana for their citizens who need it most. Amendment 2 re-flects that wisdom and will ensure that Florida does not end up like California.
Amendment 2 draws on that wellspring of experien-
tial wisdom to provide Florida with a solid foundation and firm, clear guidelines for the Department of Health to construct a safe, secure medical marijuana system. 
The fine print will not open the floodgates to allow any-
one access to marijuana as Alexander fears.
The amendment would allow the use of medical 
marijuana for individuals with “conditions for which a physician believes that the medical use of marijuana 
would likely outweigh the potential health risks for a 
patient.”
Those extra words, which Alexander seemingly ig-
nored, are very important. They build circumscribed 
flexibility into the amendment to allow greater access 
with only a patient’s doctor’s carefully considered per-mission. Proposition 215 lacked this language, and that is but one of many reasons why Florida’s medical mari-juana system will not turn out like California’s.
Alexander is wrong to characterize Amendment 2 
as “reactive.” Florida is employing a measured process that is similar to, albeit more difficult to accomplish be-cause amendments are difficult to pass in Florida, the 
processes used by nearly every other state that has le-
galized medical marijuana.
In addition, Florida will benefit from groups like 
Florida For Care who bring together diverse experts to explain the regulatory process, ensuring that Florida 
avoids pitfalls and unintended consequences.
Alexander’s concerns over the efficacy of Amend-
ment 2 are admirable. She echoes the concerns of many 
Floridians who agree that we should allow compassion-
ate use of medical marijuana but not at the cost of our 
state’s moral and social fabric. Her active engagement in this issue bolsters the argument that Florida will not follow in California’s footsteps.
Amendment 2 anticipates the thoughtful concerns of 
Florida residents like Alexander and provides oppor-tunity for their concerns to be addressed through the legislative and rulemaking process. Rather than deny countless patients across Florida, like her mother, ac-
cess to beneficial treatment, Alexander should vote yes 
on 2, stay engaged and help make Florida’s medical marijuana system an exemplary model for the rest of the country.

The aroma of smoked sausages, hamburg-
ers and hotdogs wafted from an 80-foot-long 
grill stationed near Gate 2 of the Stephen C. O’Connell Center on Saturday.
The “Ultimate Smoker and Grill” cooked 
up enough for 5,000 Gator fans at the HISTO-RY All-American Tailgate Tour event, hosted by the History channel.
UF was the fourth stop on the tailgate tour, 
which included five other universities.
The grill was operated by Trace “Rib Whis-
perer” Arnold. Arnold became involved in the event after History reached out to him to bring his grill on the tour.
Arnold said he can typically cook 1,000 hot-
dogs, 500 hamburgers or 200 16-ounce steaks 
simultaneously.
Arnold gave fans a preview of his expertise 
by offering free smoked sausages.
“It’s History’s way of giving back to the 
people and the colleges…and saying thanks to 
the people watching the shows,” Arnold said.
Arnold said the spirit of tailgating is what 
urged him to participate in the tour.
Jennifer Hayes, the senior marketing man-
ager for the History channel within the con-sumer marketing department, said the event took a year of careful planning with the hopes of reaching out to the History audience.
“We thought the college football game area 
would be perfect because they all gather here, they’re having a great time, and they all watch 
History,” Hayes said.
Hayes said the History channel plans to 
host another tailgate next year, and they are finding ways to improve it.
Fans had the opportunity to win small 
prizes during the tailgate and through social media.
They were encouraged to use Twitter and 
Instagram with the hashtag #HISTORYtail-
gate.

ed in line to ride the mechanical gator at the event. She said the History tailgate stood out among other tailgating booths.

Celebrities are not the only 
ones having their personal pic-
tures leaked online.  
Photos and videos from 
Snapchat, a popular photo mes-saging application, were re-leased Friday.
More than 100,000 images 
were leaked from a third-party app using Snapchat, Business Insider reported.
Hackers have been compil-
ing the Snapchat files for years onto the chat forum 4Chan. A majority of the content released onto the Internet contained 
nude photos of minors. Users 
on 4Chan are referring to the hack as “The Snappening.”
Bruce Floyd, social media 
manager for University Ath-
letic Association, said services 
like Snapchat can never reveal compromising photos if they are never submitted in the first 
place.
“I hope it makes people 
aware about the kinds of con-
tent that they are posting,” Floyd said.
Snapchat has confirmed that 
these leaked photos came from third-party sites, according to Business Insider. A third-party Snapchat client application has been collecting every file ex-
changed through the applica-
tion, providing hackers with 
access to a library.
Files sent through the of-
ficial Snapchat application are 
automatically deleted after an 
allotted shared time. With an application called Snapsave, users can keep Snapchat pho-tos and videos. News reports 
have suggested this was one of 
the applications intercepted by hackers.
This is not the first time 
Snapchat has been hacked. Last year, Snapchat users’ phone numbers were stolen.
UF psychology senior Briana 
Glick, an avid Snapchat user, 
said she will now be more care-
ful with what she sends.

that Snapchat is leaking these 
pictures,” the 21-year-old said.

Beginning in December, Gainesville Police will of-
fer Rape Aggression Defense training to its officers.
The training will prepare officers to teach the free 
R.A.D. classes at the GPD station. 
Tina Lamb, a certified R.A.D. instructor and coor-
dinator for University Police, said GPD approached 
her to help train more instructors as an expansion.
“GPD wants to add R.A.D. to their regular offer-
ings,” Lamb said. “It’s amazing — it’s what it’s really all about with R.A.D. There are over 11,000 instruc-tors in the nation. The goal is to keep expanding so more women can be safer.”
R.A.D. classes are basic self-defense classes de-
signed for women. They consist of four three-hour classes about verbal, moderate and extreme tech-niques to escape attacks and build empowerment.
GPD Sgt. Paris Owens and Lamb have already 
started offering R.A.D. classes for the community  Sundays at the GPD station.
“I was a student who became an instructor,” Lamb 
said. 
Lamb has taught students who have gone on to 
teach R.A.D. classes of their own.
“We all work together. That’s what it’s all about,” 
she said. 
Becca Javier, a UF communications sciences and 
disorders sophomore, said she is proud of R.A.D.’s upcoming expansion.

Four years after the Deepwater 
Horizon oil spill plagued the Gulf of 
Mexico, the third and largest phase of gulf restoration projects was an-nounced — almost 70 percent of 
which Florida will head.
Gov. Rick Scott announced the state’s $105 million pledge to plan 
last week, which involves five states and was drafted by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill’s natural resource damage assessment trustees.
Florida is heading 30 of 44 total 
projects, along with Texas, Alabama, 
Louisiana and Mississippi.
About $88 million is designated 
for 28 projects throughout commu-
nities along the Florida Panhandle, according to Ashley Williams, Flor-ida Department of Environmental Protection spokeswoman. Another $15 million will go toward two proj-ects near the Gulf Islands in Escam-bia County.
“When the Horizon blew in the 
Gulf of Mexico, it was a major cata-strophic loss for Escambia County,” 
said Gene Valentino, an Escambia 
County commissioner.
He said the $15 million desig-
nated to his region “is but a sliver of what is needed to resolve the dam-ages in our county.”These restoration projects include 
scallop enhancement, sea grass recovery, artificial reefs and fish hatcheries, Williams said. But the majority of Florida funding is going to recreational projects like protect-ing the dunes and boat ramps.
“Florida’s biggest known in-
jury to date is lost recreational use, so that’s why they’re more heavily focused on that at this point,” Wil-liams said.
The department expects to re-ceive BP funding within the next couple of weeks and begin imple-menting projects in about 105 days.
UF business administration se-
nior Katherine Salz said restoration projects should receive more fund-ing.
“We don’t know how much 
damage has been done and how much is irreversible,” said Salz, 21. “Ultimately, it’s most important that wildlife is preserved.”

Remembering Gator Growl’s Past
Homecoming 1982
It takes a certain kind of comedian to get an au-
dience of expectant college students to laugh at the 
same joke — or sound effect in this case — about bodybuilders not once, but twice. Robin Williams grunted his way through one part of headlining the 1982 Gator Growl. “I go ooh, wow, I feel like I’m having an orgasm in front of 65,000 people. I feel like smoking a cigarette and asking ‘Was it good for me?’” He had fun with the crowd, even taking a camera from someone in the front row to take a pic-ture of his groin, calling it “Mr. Happy, the incred-ible heat-seeking moisture missile.” He lamented his days on “Mork and Mindy,“ while sparing no faint-of-heart in the crowd from any four-letter word.
Homecoming 1984
The pudding man blessed UF’s campus for the 
first time. A cigar-smoking Bill Cosby headlined the 59th Growl. He kept his traditional standup topics, which were tweaked for a college audience. “I come on campus and I hear it — party,” he joked. Thrown in with his jokes about childhood and par-enthood, he joked about parents sending their kids to college to make their brains fall out from study-ing, all while wearing a bright orange sweatsuit with the number 69 on the front and back.
Homecoming 1986
Long before “Comedians in Cars Getting Cof-
fee,” Jerry Seinfeld was the second act in the 1986 Growl. Steven Wright headlined the event in front of about 70,000 students, but the audience seemed to prefer Seinfeld’s sarcastic jabs to Wright’s philo-sophical jokes. He made full-body gestures at his distaste for hair on the bathroom wall, and he tout-ed shower radios as a great idea because there’s “no better place to dance than a slick surface next to a glass door.”

Sciences, along with the Florida Mu-seum of Natural History, the Samuel P. Harn Museum of Art and the Phil-lips Center for the Performing Arts will host events including clay throw-ing, art exhibitions and photography workshops.
The events are to raise awareness 
for arts and humanities and will be held from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. around campus.
Jessica Ward, marketing assistant 
for the College of Fine Arts, wrote in an email that the event will fea-ture swing dancing, as well as poetry 
readings, spoken word performances 
and philosophical debates.
Ward said the events are impor-
tant because they showcase the arts, which often take a back seat to the science, technology, engineering and mathematics curriculum.
“We cannot afford to neglect the 
arts,” Ward said. “I do think enough students appreciate the arts, but it might not be coming from their edu-cational experiences but from innate desires to do so.”
The events will take place on the 
Plaza of the Americas, the Fine Arts 
Complex and the Southwest Recre-
ation Center, according to a press re-lease.
“These performances are outside, 
so we will reach many who would not purchase performance tickets,” Ward said.
Tori Glod, a UF dance junior, is 
participating in “Pop-Up Culture” 
this year. She said the School of The-
atre and Dance will perform excerpts around campus from a dance piece.
Glod, 22, said the event is a great 
opportunity to bring awareness to the arts that are prevalent on campus.Arts events to ‘Pop-Up’ around campus

Slight confusion surrounded 
the end of Florida’s 30-27 loss 
against LSU Saturday night. 
After the Tigers forced a turn-
over with 24 seconds remaining, running back Terrence Magee had a 3-yard run, getting slightly 
closer to set up a game-winning 
field goal from kicker Colby Delahoussaye.
But as the clock wound down, 
Florida (3-2, 2-2 Southeastern 
Conference) players impeded 
LSU’s attempt to spike the ball and kill the clock — the Tigers (5-2, 1-2 SEC) had no timeouts.
“On the first down scrimmage 
play, the runner was ruled down with approximately 20 seconds remaining in the game,” an SEC communications official said in 
a statement. “The officials de-
termined the defensive team de-layed the officials from making the ball ready for play by failing 
to unpile in a timely manner. The 
referee stopped the game clock in order to get the ball ready for play and he reset the game clock to the time at which he recog-nized the delay.”
But in an identical situation 
laid out in the NCAA rulebook section four, article two, subsec-
tion II: 
“(if) On a running play late in 
the half the Team A (LSU) ball 
carrier is tackled inbounds. Team 
B (Florida) players are deliber-
ately slow to ‘unpile’ in an obvi-ous attempt to consume time and prevent the officials from mak-ing the ball ready for play” then 
Team B should have been flagged 
for delay of game, and the game clock should have started on the snap of the next play.
The referee opted not to call 
the delay of game penalty, but did use a discretionary timeout he is afforded in section three, ar-ticle one, part a: 
“The referee may declare and 
charge himself with a discretion-ary timeout for any contingency not elsewhere covered by the 
rules.”
In this case, that contingency 
is how much time should be put 
back on the clock. 
It would appear that the ref-
erees in fact did not do enough, 
and in addition to adding the necessary time back on the clock, 
should have given the Tigers five yards after assessing a delay of game penalty on the Gators.
The game clock was in the 
single digits before head referee 
Mike Austin reset it back to 10 
seconds. 
LSU then proceeded to spike the ball with eight seconds re-maining, Delahoussaye made the 50-yard go ahead field goal and 
LSU won after Adam Lane was 
tackled on the ensuing kick re-turn.

Jalen Tabor is coming into his own.
With starter Vernon Hargreaves III 
on the sidelines during the second half 
of Florida’s 30-27 loss to LSU on Satur-
day, the true freshman cornerback saw extended time against the Tigers.
And he held his own.
One week after earning the first start 
of his career, Tabor finished Saturday 
with seven total tackles, one pass break-up and a third-quarter sack on a corner blitz.
“He’s done a nice job,” coach Will 
Muschamp said. 
“He’s covered well. A couple well-
thrown balls (were thrown his way). … 
We’ve been proud of his process, day-to-day improving himself to get better and 
better.”
Pass rush continues 
to progress: The Gators’ 
pass rush brought the heat for the second straight week.
Just seven days 
after sacking Tennes-see quarterback Justin Worley six times, Flor-
ida sacked LSU signal caller Anthony Jennings four times on Saturday.
Redshirt sophomore Alex McCalister 
led the way with one-and-a-half sacks.
The Gators had seven tackles for loss 
against the Tigers as well as five quarter-
back hurries.Notebook: Tabor developing

For the second consecutive weekend, 
No. 9 Florida (12-3, 6-0 Southeastern Con-
ference) closed its weekend matchups 
with two wins against conference oppo-
nents.
Starting out the weekend against un-
ranked Georgia (9-7, 1-3 SEC) on Friday, 
Florida finished the night with a sweep of 
the Bulldogs.
While Florida closed the night 3-0 
against Georgia, Sunday’s matchup against No. 19 Texas A&M was the big-
gest game of the weekend for volleyball.
Florida swept A&M 25-12, 25-23 and 
25-17, a feat defensive specialist Taylor 
Unroe credited to Florida’s scouting re-
port.
The Aggies are the first ranked confer-
ence opponent that Florida has faced this 
season, but they proved to be just a small bump in Florida’s road to the postseason.
However, even with a sweep, coach Mary Wise said the Florida squad knew it had to come into the game aggressive to 
pull out the win.
“You play three matches on the road 
and you appreciate being home,” Wise 
said. 
“Friday night was a great crowd. 
(There was) a lot of energy in the build-ing. Going into this match, what they (the 
team) saw on video they knew that the 
only way we’d beat this team is with their A-game. That was the message and today we got everyone’s A-game.”
It’d be hard to say Wise was wrong 
about her team’s performance on Sun-day.

UF coach“We’ve done a better job at get-
ting some one-on-one matchups 
we feel like we can win as far as edges are concerned,” Muschamp 
said. 
“So I thought they did a nice job 
for the most part.”
A streak dropped: Quinton 
Dunbar saw his 32-game catch 
streak fizzle away Saturday night.
The redshirt senior wide re-
ceiver was targeted just once on Florida’s first drive of the game.
He dropped the pass.
Prior to Saturday, Dunbar 
hauled in a reception in every 
game dating back to Florida’s 54-32 win against Furman on Nov. 19, 
2011. 
The 32 consecutive games with 
a catch are the third-most in Gators 
history, three behind Ike Hilliard’s 35 straight games set from 1994-
1997.
Eye of the Tiger:  LSU was the only SEC team with a Tiger mas-
cot that won on Saturday. No. 13 Georgia defeated the No. 23 Mis-souri Tigers 34-0 in Columbia, Mo., 
and No. 3 Mississippi State topped 
the No. 2 Auburn Tigers 38-23.
Taylor starts, barely runs: Run-
ning back Kelvin Taylor received 
his first start of the season on Sat-
urday, but that didn’t translate into an increase production.
The sophomore received just 
two carries and totaled 0 yards for 
his efforts. 
While Taylor has limited touch-
es, freshman running back Bran-
don Powell had a telling return. 
The true freshman running 
back recorded 66 yards on a team-high six receptions and six rushing yards on one more attempt than Taylor (three) in his first game 
since suffering a hamstring injury. 
Kicking with accuracy: Red-
shirt senior Frankie Velez made 
both of his field goals (34 yards and 
18 yards) against LSU. The Gators 
have converted nine of their 11 field goal attempts this season.of the Gators season. So far, Flor-ida has swept five of its six con-ference opponents and has held conference opponents to under a .200 attacking percentage.
Florida’s defense was able to 
hold Texas A&M to a team attack 
percentage of .000 in both the 
first and third set. Overall, the Aggies were held to a .119 hitting 
efficiency.
Florida, on the other hand, 
dominated on offense, finishing 
the match with a .395 attack clip.
Leading Florida’s effort on the 
offensive was sophomore right-
side hitter Alex Holston, who 
ended the day with 13 kills on 22 attempts with only one error finishing with a .545 clip on Sun-day.
Defensively she was just as 
powerful, making seven digs, one solo block and two block assists.
On defense, Unroe had one of 
her best games of the season. The senior had 10 digs and two ser-vice aces for the day.
Unroe was Florida’s libero 
last season and achieved honors 
like SEC Libero of the Year and 
AVCA All-Southeast Region 2013 selection.
But senior Holly Pole has tak-
en on the position since she was switched with Unroe halfway through Florida’s match against Oklahoma on Aug. 30.
“We started with her in the 
right back, so she got more op-portunities and took advantage of them, and that’s how the game 
is played.” Wise said. “You don’t 
know when you’re name is going to be called, what rotation, how fast it’s going to be or how long 
you’re going to be on the court so 
you take advantage of the oppor-tunities, and that’s what she did today.”14, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, OCTOBER 13, 2014

With the Gators sec-
ond tournament of the sea-
son over, the young team 
has found it’s leaders, and 
they’re two freshmen.
Four of the eight team 
members went to Jackson-
ville for the 2014 Bedford 
Cup held Friday through Sunday. Though none came back with a title, rookie Peg-gie Porter finished clean in 
the first two rounds of singles 
play before dropping her fi-nals match against Miami’s Sinead Lohan (6-2, 6-4). 
“We made a nice run to 
the finals, but unfortunately we didn’t play the way we wanted to today,” associate head coach Dave Balogh said 
in a release. “We got some 
good matches in this week-end, but there is a lot of work we need to continue to build 
on.”
The other freshman lead-
er, Brooke Austin, came back 
from the Riviera/ITA All American Championship 
earlier this month with an au-
tomatic bid into the National Indoor Intercollegiate Cham-pionships in November. She advanced to the singles semifinals of the weeklong 
tournament’s main draw un-
til dropping straight sets to No. 7-ranked Channelle Van Nguyen from Southern Cali-fornia, 6-2, 7-5. 
Three sophomores also 
competed in the Bedford Cup singles tournament but none 
made it to the main draw. 
Stefani Stojic won her 
first two rounds until facing 
fellow teammate Porter in the third round, when she dropped 4-6, 6-2, 7-5 Sunday 
morning.
Belinda Woolcock won 
her first two rounds as well, 
until she dropped a three-set 
match against Lohan (6-3, 
4-6, 6-1).
Spencer Liang dropped 
her first round on Friday af-ter playing Yukako Noi from 
Florida State, 2-6, 6-1, 6-0. 
Though the Maryland na-tive made it the main draw of consolation singles until defeat from Central Florida’s Caroline Eberhart, 7-6, 6-3.
“The girls played tough 
today,” Balogh said on Sat-urday. “Having three Gators in the singles semifinals was 
nice.”Freshman falls in final

Florida can get even better.
That’s a scary proposition 
for the rest of the Southeast-ern Conference, but it’s what Florida’s coaches and players 
believe.
“Our team is just getting 
conﬁ  dent after each game, 
and we’re trying to improve each game,” said senior Tessa Andujar, the team’s leader in assists, “and our motto is this year, every game, play like it’s a championship game.”
The Gators have shown that 
mentality all season long, never resting on what they have ac-complished. Instead, they have realized that every game is a chance to grow.
The same can be said for 
practice, and when the team puts emphasis on a speciﬁ  c as-
pect of its game, the dividends 
show.
For example, during the 
week leading up to Friday night’s 5-1 victory over Missis-sippi State, Savannah Jordan – Florida’s leading scorer with 11 goals, including two Fri-day – said the team focused on ball distribution and creating chances in order to penetrate the Bulldogs’ defense.
The result was the Gators 
23 shots in the game, while the Bulldogs only managed to take 
ﬁ  ve, and Florida’s ﬁ  ve goals 
were scored by four different players.
This approach to the year 
has led Florida to an 11-2 re-cord, including a 6-0 record in the SEC.
With the win against Mis-
sissippi State, Florida is on a 
seven-game win streak that 
dates back to Sept. 12 and has outscored its opponents 18-5 during that time frame.
Florida has ﬁ  ve games re-
maining in the regular sea-son, and that means only ﬁ  ve chances remain – aside from any postseason appearances 
– for goalkeeper Taylor Burke 
to break the school solo shut-out record. She has 26 in her Florida career and needs one more to tie the mark, while two would break it.
Florida goes back on the 
road this week, with games at South Carolina and Kentucky 
on Thursday and Sunday, re-
spectively.
night came with less than a minute left in 
the game. He made a bad decision and threw a slant pass to Latroy Pittman Jr., who was double covered. 
One defender hit the ball with the 
crown of his helmet as it was entering Pitt-man’s hands, tipping the ball and allowing the second defender to pick it off.
That pick gave LSU the ball back deep 
in Florida territory setting up the 50-yard ﬁ  eld goal by LSU’s Colby Delahoussaye to give the Tigers a three point lead with three seconds left in the game. “An interception to give them the ball 
there on the plus-side of the ﬁ  eld, I’d like to have that back,” Driskel said.
Sixth-year senior Andre Debose, who 
ﬁ  nished the game with 184 total yards, ex-pressed his disappointment following the 
last-second loss. 
“There is deﬁ  nitely an empty feeling. 
We didn’t get the [win]. We played hard 
and fought to the end; that’s all we can 
ask for, just to play our guts out.” Debose 
said. 
Empty feelings following games need 
to be few and far between for the Gators moving forward.Even though the loss against an SEC 
West team means the conference picture is still in Florida’s hands, a loss is still a loss — something Muschamp can’t afford to do too often in the back half of the season. 
Florida has a big SEC East matchup 
against Missouri this week, a 36-17 road loss for the Gators last season. 
The following week is a bye week be-
fore facing No. 10 Georgia for the annual 
matchup in Jacksonville — a game Mus-
champ, a former UGA safety, has never won as a coach or player in seven at-tempts. 
The last two big games on the sched-ule are South Carolina at home and No. 2 
Florida State on the road. 
It’s not the end of the road for Mus-
champ by any means, but at the midway 
point of the regular season, the Gators can’t afford to have many missed oppor-
tunities, empty feelings or losses if they 
want to keep him around.
And they are not looking back.“This won’t bother us much,” Debose 
said. “We’re anxious to get back to work. We’re just going to look forward. We can’t dawn on the past. We fought our hearts out. We left it all on the line and that’s all we can ask for.”MONDAY, OCTOBER 13, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15
