For the second year in a row, Florida hoisted the 
NCAA Championship trophy at the podium and cel-
ebrated a successful result at the Super Six. 
But this time around, the Gators shared the spot-
light.
UF claimed a share of its second consecutive 
NCAA Championship on Saturday night in Birming-
ham, Ala., when it tied Oklahoma with a score of 
198.175.  
Florida keeps making history. In 2013, UF claimed 
its ﬁ  rst NCAA championship to become just the ﬁ  fth program to win the title. Now, UF and Oklahoma are 
the ﬁ  rst co-champions in the 33-year history of NCAA 
gymnastics. 
“I’ve always felt that if there’s a tie, it needs to re-
main a tie,” coach Rhonda Faehn said in a postgame 
press conference. “This is such an incredibly challeng-
ing competition. I understand the tie-break situation for qualiﬁ  cations, but for the actual title, if there’s a tie, then that’s how it should be.” 
Saturday was not the ﬁ  rst tie in the 2014 NCAA 
Championship in Birmingham, Ala. UF advanced to 
the NCAA Super Six team ﬁ  nal after tying with host 
Alabama in Friday’s second semiﬁ  nal. FLORIDA GYMNASTICS REPEATS

Steve Lachnicht isn’t afraid.
“Just because of the car accident, 
you don’t stop driving on the high-way,” he said. “The best thing to do is to just go and carry on.”
Lachnicht, director of growth man-
agement for Alachua County, was run-ning his fourth Boston Marathon when 
two bombs exploded last year, killing 
three and injuring more than 250 peo-ple. 
Despite a faux bomb scare on the 
one-year anniversary last Tuesday, Lachnicht said he will run again in the marathon today.
Gainesville residents and UF alum-
ni are joining runners across the coun-
try to race in Boston a year later. In the 
wake of the 2013 bombing, some run-ners expect an inﬂ  ux of people to come out to the marathon to show support. 
UF alumnus Jeremy Criscione ran 
in the marathon in 2013, too. He will not make it to Boston this year but said he expects the turnout will be even higher.
“I think it’ll inﬂ  uence more people 
to want to run,” the 26-year-old said. “You can’t always live in fear.” 
A commemorative run at the site 
of the bombings went sour Tuesday 
when a veiled man dressed in black 
ran screaming down the ﬁ  nish line car-rying a backpack, according to a Bos-ton Police Department statement.

A show at downtown High Dive Bar & 
Venue got washed out early Saturday morn-
ing after police reported a local man in the crowd used a ﬁ  re extinguisher for no reason, damaging about $1,620 of liquor in the pro-cess. 
Gainesville Police arrested 58-year-old 
William J. Brady on charges of criminal mis-chief and carrying a concealed weapon, ac-cording to an arrest report.
At about 1:20 a.m., a band was perform-
ing at the bar, located at 210 SW Second Ave., when Brady grabbed one of the venue’s ﬁ  re extinguishers and shot foam into the air near the stage. 
Patrick Lavery, who handles booking for 
the bar, was outside when the incident oc-curred.
“Everybody ran out immediately,” Lav-
ery said. “The band stopped playing. It was very alarming.”Lavery said an employee escorted the man 
to the parking lot and asked him to leave, but he refused. 
An Alachua County Sheriff’s deputy al-
ready on the scene detained the man until GPD arrived, Lavery said. That’s when La-very heard Brady say he thought he saw a 
ﬁ  re. 
All of the contaminated alcohol has been 
thrown out, Lavery said. 
High Dive is continuing to assess damage, 
including possible harm done to the sound 
system.  
Ofﬁ  cers booked Brady into the Alachua 
County Jail at about 3 a.m., where he re-mained as of press time in lieu of a $12,500 bond.Man ruins alcohol by using

Urine was just one thing vandals threw down the 
second ﬂ  oor of Trusler Hall. They also threw ammo-nia-ﬁ  lled baggies, rotten eggs and over-ripe vegeta-bles on the walls. “They peed in bags and smashed 
them all over the walls and doors,” resident Francine 
Schwartz said. One of the four male participants was identiﬁ  ed and faced a conduct hearing.
April 23, 1996 UF was ranked fourth among all U.S. universi-
ties in the number of patents awarded and ninth in royalty income from product licensing, according to a 1993 report by the Association of University Tech-
nology Managers. A good portion of the royalties are 
due to Gatorade, which made UF more than $4 mil-lion in 1995.

WORLD
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
VATICAN CITY — Marking 
Christianity’s most hopeful day, Pope 
Francis made an Easter Sunday plea for peace and dialogue in Ukraine 
and Syria, for an end to terrorist at-
tacks against Christians in Nigeria 
and for more attention to the hungry and neediest close to home.
More than 150,000 tourists turned 
out for the Mass that Francis celebrat-ed at an altar set up under a canopy on the steps of St. Peter’s Basilica.
Easter is the culmination of Holy 
Week and marks Christian belief that Jesus rose from the dead after his cru-ciﬁ  xion.
Francis noted that this year, the 
Catholic church’s celebration of Eas-ter coincided with that of Orthodox churches, which have many followers in Ukraine.
Francis prayed that God would 
“enlighten and inspire the initiatives that promote peace in Ukraine, so that all those involved, with the sup-port of the international community, will make every effort to prevent vio-lence.”
Francis also prayed that all sides in 
Syria will be moved to “boldly negoti-
ate the peace long awaited and long 
overdue.” Syria has been wracked by a three-year civil war that has cost 
150,000 lives and forced millions to 
ﬂ  ee the country.
Christians make 
up about 5 percent of Syria’s popula-
tion. In comments 
to mark Easter 
there, the Greek 
Orthodox patriarch vowed that Chris-
tians there “will not 
submit” to extremists who attack “our 
people and holy places.”
Francis makes a pilgrimage to 
Jordan, the Palestinian territories 
and Israel next month, so on Easter 
he prayed that hopes sparked by the 
resumption of Mideast peace negotia-
tions will be sustained.
Thousands of pilgrims from around 
the world ﬂ  ocked to celebrate Easter in the Holy Land, where Christian communities, as well as elsewhere in 
the Middle East, have been declining 
as the faithful ﬂ  ee regional turmoil.
Francis also spoke of those suf-
fering in Africa from an epidemic of deadly Ebola and urged a halt to 
“brutal terrorist attacks” in parts of 
Nigeria.
Nigerians marked Easter with 
heightened security against a spread-ing Islamic uprising, mourning the 
deaths of 75 bomb blast victims and 
fearful of the fate of 85 abducted 
schoolgirls. The homegrown terror 
network Boko Haram has claimed re-sponsibility for last week’s rush-hour 
explosion in the capital, Abuja, and 
threatened more attacks.
But Francis’ Easter message also 
urged people to pay attention to the needy close to home. He said the 
“good news” of Easter’s joy means 
“leaving ourselves behind and en-
countering others, being close to those 
crushed by life’s troubles, sharing with the needy, standing at the side of 
the sick, elderly and the outcast.”At Easter celebration, Pope Francis

Catch it early enough, and it can be killed.
But catch it too late, and cancer can grow unnoticed, mu-
tating and multiplying until it defeats its prey.
There are ways to take down the predator, said Dr. Paul 
Okunieff, director of the UF Health Cancer Center, but not 
everyone knows about them.
That’s why he and a team of community health workers 
started the Community Cancer Resource Center, which held 
its grand opening Friday.
Located at 2401 SW Archer Road, the center will provide 
free cancer prevention, diagnosis and treatment information for Florida residents.  Former Alachua County School Board administrator Samuel Gaddy will direct the center, which is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Tuesday and Thursday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
“This is really important for the people of Florida, and for 
this area in speciﬁ  c,” Okunieff said.
He said cancer kills more people in Florida than almost 
any other state, second only to California. And it takes more lives in Alachua County and Florida than any other cause, even car accidents, he said.“Florida already does pretty bad,” Okunieff said. “Ala-
chua does even worse.”
He said part of the reason is poor Floridians with cancer 
don’t seek the help they need.
“They frankly don’t even know what they should be 
seeking,” he said.
High illiteracy rates and wealth disparities discourage 
rural Alachua County residents from getting the help they 
need, he said. The new cancer resource center will provide 
information on every aspect of the disease, from mysterious lumps to blood-ﬁ  lled lungs.
Catching lung cancer early means chances of survival 
are more than 80 percent, he said. Catch it too late, and the chances are zero.
Because a lot of people in the area smoke, Okunieff said, 
“we’re basically southern Georgia.”
The center is the brainchild of Folakemi Odedina, director 
of community outreach and minority affairs at UF College of Medicine’s Prostate Disease Center.
Odedina said the cancer resource center, despite being 
housed in Gainesville, will be a statewide asset. Floridians can get advice and counseling by phone, she said.
It’s funded by HealthStreet, the community outreach 
branch of the UF epidemiology department that attempts to reduce health disparities in the area by providing free infor-mation and resources.Local community cancer center opensFrancis

Runners approach the finish line of the Boston Marathon, a midpoint of a 5K race, on Saturday. The 
118th running of the event is scheduled for today, Patriots’ Day. 
‘We’re here for the 284 and everyone else that was affected’
crime; disturbing the peace; dis-
turbing a public assembly; and disorderly conduct, according to the statement.
At about 6:50 p.m., officers pres-
ent for added security as well and civilians noticed Edson running barefoot, yelling and screaming. 
The event was open to the general 
public, according to the statement.
When officers stopped Edson, 
they removed his veil and hat to 
find his face painted blue and yel-
low. His backpack contained a rice cooker, according to the statement. Another unattended bag was found at the event but belonged to 
a media outlet.
When first-year UF dental stu-
dent Neal Singh heard the news, 
he said he was in awe.
“I’m just shocked someone 
would really try to imitate what happened last year,” the 23-year-old said. “It just blows my mind.”
During his time as president 
of the Sikh Student Association, Singh organized a commemorative run for the bombings in 2013 just days after the event.
“We really just wanted to spread the message of equality,” 
he said. “Everyone’s life should be 
respected.”
Singh, who still helps out with 
the organization, said there are no plans for a commemorative run this year.
 On Sunday, he joined a handful 
of officers and members at a place of worship in Tampa to celebrate the holiday Vaisakhi, and they re-flected on the marathon after the service, he said.
“Our prayers are still with those 
victims and the families,” Singh said. “We keep them in mind al-ways on some level.”
So does UF track team alumnus 
Matt Hensley, who drew the num-ber 284 on a plain white jersey to commemorate the number of vic-tims last year. He said he plans to 
wear the jersey when he runs this 
year’s marathon with his three brothers and his father. 
Hensley and his family decided 
they would run the next marathon on the day of the 2013 bombings, the 26-year-old said.
“We’re here for the 284 and ev-
eryone else that was affected,” he 
said. “And that’s what the race is 
about.”Boston , from page 1locAl

Billy MacConel was born with 
cerebral palsy.
But more importantly, he was 
born a Gator.
“I got it running through my 
veins,” the 24-year-old said.
MacConel, a fifth-year UF 
telecommunication student, loves 
the Gator Nation. And soon, he and other wheelchair users will be able to travel through it more easily.
Regional Transit System is 
upgrading bus stops to include 
concrete pads that will provide 
level waiting platforms for riders with mobility disabilities, RTS 
spokesman Chip Skinner wrote 
in an email.
The concrete pads will allow 
them to wait without being on a slope or soft ground and will make it easier for the buses’ wheelchair lifts.
Construction of the landing 
pads varies depending on the 
landscape, Skinner said, but it is 
typically about $5,500 each for design and placement.
“Unfortunately, a design and 
permits are needed and we cannot just purchase a bag of cement and pour the pads ourselves,” he said. “The cost can really escalate if the stop is on a slope or other amenities are placed.”
Funding comes from sources 
like the city of Gainesville, Alachua County, the Florida Department of Transportation and the federal government, Skinner said.RTS is also in the process 
of placing Americans with Disabilities Act-compliant benches, which have backs and are slanted at a specific angle, at its busiest stops and where riders with disabilities visit the most, he said.
More shelters and trash cans 
are also part of the upgrades, 
Skinner said. 
Michelle Sterling, a UF Health 
representative, said clients in 
wheelchairs complain mostly about being late to appointments because of buses.
“It’s hard because we have to 
kind of fuss and fight with the doctors,” she said. “Sometimes what they’ll do is just try to work 
them into a later appointment, 
but really, that’s not fair to the patient.”
In his email, Skinner said bus 
operators sometimes complain about the time involved in maintaining the travel schedule while strapping in wheelchairs. 
“This is a continuing process,” 
he said, “and a number of them are done each year as funding becomes available.” 
People who have Americans 
with Disabilities Act certification cards may ride RTS fixed-route buses for free, according to the RTS website. Most can also bring a helper for free, too.

The story of Kofi Adu-Brempong, the 
UF student from Ghana who was shot in 
the face by campus police, is coming to the big screen Tuesday.
Four years ago, Adu-Brempong hid 
in his apartment while University Police gathered outside.
His neighbor heard screams from his 
apartment and called the police. The day before, the mentally stressed doctoral student had sent troubling emails to the geography department chairman, who stood outside with the police asking Adu-Brempong to come out. He refused, and police broke down the door.
According to Alligator archives, he 
didn’t put down his cane and a butcher knife, so the officers shot him with two Tasers, four bean-bag rounds and sev-eral rounds from an assault rifle.
“In His Own Home” is a documen-
tary of the events that led up to the shooting. Directed by UF English pro-fessor Malini Johar Schueller, the film is a string of interviews with Adu-Brem-pong’s neighbors, the then-director of the NAACP and students who protested the shooting.
“It deserved more coverage than just 
being a local incident,” Schueller said. 
“It’s a story that needs to be told.”
The 42-minute film will be shown at 
the Hippodrome State Theatre at 7:30 
p.m. Tuesday. It’s free.Shot student’s story on screen � BIKE & BUILD RAISES MONEY AND

Internships, Summer courses and vacations 
aren’t the only ways UF students are spending 
their summers. 
Three UF students are traveling with Bike 
& Build, a nonprofit that raises money and 
awareness for affordable housing with eight 
cross-country trips annually. Each trip has its own route and about 30 riders.
The trip lasts about 10 weeks, and riders 
bike about 70 miles a day, said Justin Villere, director of operations and outreach for Bike & Build. Along the way, they work with a range of nonprofits building houses for low-income families or individuals.
Villere said riders are mostly college stu-
dents, but that’s not a requirement, and neither is biking experience.“It’s more people who have a passion for 
service and adventure and who are looking to put the legwork into doing it … pun intended,” 
Villere said.
Michele Lis, a 22-year-old UF medical an-
thropology junior, heard about the program 
through another UF student who will be par-ticipating this summer. She said she wanted to do it because it sounded like an adventure.
Riders are required to raise at least $4,500 to 
participate.
Bike & Build’s goal for the summer is to grant 
$600,000 to more than 300 affordable housing nonprofits across the country. Last year, they gave out about $470,000, said Villere.
Marlee Henninge, a 20-year-old UF geog-
raphy junior, was also encouraged to apply to Bike & Build by a friend. She likes the idea of immersive service projects, as opposed to a single day of volunteering.
“I cannot fathom the idea of being in Califor-
nia and knowing I just completed 4,000 miles of biking across the country,” she said.Three UF students to bike US“Unfortunately, a design

Colleen O’Fallon, a UF alumna and owner of Sweet Paws Bakery, helps Spike, a 7-year-old bichon 
frise and poodle mix, receive his reward for successfully finding an Easter egg. Sweet Paws hosted an Easter egg hunt for dogs Friday evening. Eggs contained dog treats.

Alligator Contributing Writer
A brown-eyed Cavalier King 
Charles spaniel named Maddie 
nosed around Sweet Paws Bakery Friday night in search of brightly colored plastic Easter eggs and the 
treats inside.
Maddie, 8, took part in the 
Haile Plantation community bak-
ery’s seventh annual Easter egg hunt for dogs.
The Easter tradition began in 
the shop’s first year after shop owner Colleen O’Fallon said she noticed her own dogs enjoyed 
hunting for hidden goodies.
“My dogs love searching for 
treats, and I figured they weren’t 
alone,” she said.
The event has been held every 
year since, she said, providing a social experience for dogs and owners alike.
Jennifer Leggett, a 21-year old 
UF public relations junior who as-sists the bakery with marketing, said she had as much fun as the dogs did trying to keep them fo-cused on the task at hand.
“The dogs were running around 
oblivious,” Leggett said, “and I’m pointing and gesturing to the eggs 
with the treats, all excited.”O’Fallon started baking dog 
treats in 2005 for local farmers 
markets. In 2007, she opened Sweet Paws Bakery and expanded her product line to include food, leashes and other accessories.
Maddie’s owner, Susan Davis, 
51, has been visiting the bakery 
since it first opened.
Although this year was Mad-
die’s first Easter egg hunt, the two

Gainesville Police arrested a woman 
Sunday morning after she flipped her 
car and crashed into a building while drunken driving. 
Officers arrested 21-year-old Amy 
Cecilia Lindroth on charges of DUI dam-age to a person or property, according to an arrest report. 
At about 4:20 a.m., a witness heard 
tires screeching and saw a silver Saturn heading south on Northwest 13th Street. The car flipped and struck the lighted business sign for Orion Wells CPA, then crashed into a building, according to the report.
The witness ran to the car and found 
Lindroth hanging upside down by her seatbelt. He helped Lindroth out of her car, then asked if she was OK, according to the report. 
The officer noticed she had blood-
shot, watery eyes and dilated pupils. Afterward, the officer began a criminal investigation for a DUI. 
The officer asked her several times if 
she was injured, and she didn’t complain of an injury. She was still taken to the emergency room at UF Health Shands and cleared by medical staff, according to the report. Her BAC levels were .163 
and .177, according to the report.
Officers booked Lindroth into the 
Alachua County Jail at about noon. As of 
press time, her bond has not been set.Woman charged with DUI

MANATEE — A South Florida man’s work 
is helping researchers better understand long-
term damage to dolphins from the massive 2010 BP oil spill.
The Bradenton Herald reported Sunday that 
Randall S. Wells is helping federal researchers asses the health of dolphins in the northern Gulf of Mexico off the Louisiana coast in the Barataria Bay region. Wells is the director of the Chicago Zoological Society’s Sarasota Dolphin Research Program at the Mote Marine Labora-tory.
Wells regularly surveys a control group of 
about 160 dolphins living in the Sarasota Bay 
region and compares the health of those dol-
phins with the Louisiana dolphins.
So far, he has found that the South Florida 
dolphins are healthier than the Louisiana dol-phins. According to research that Wells con-tributed to, Barataria Bay dolphins suffered evidence of severe lung disease, lung masses and adrenal toxicity.
But Wells said there isn’t enough research 
yet to definitely link the dolphins’ health prob-lems to the oil spill even though their health issues are consistent with what is expected to happen when the animals are exposed to oil.
“I don’t think we know enough yet. We 
must complete last year’s and this year’s health assessments and see what kind of trend comes out of the data,” he said.
Charlie Hunsicker, Manatee County’s di-
rector of parks and natural resources, said he hopes healthy dolphin populations can help repopulate the damaged areas.
Unaffected areas can provide resiliency for 
Gulf-wide marine species or animals, he said.
“That analogy applies to Gulf-wide envi-
ronments that can provide and reset the envi-ronmental clock for the damaged areas because 
they are resilient, diverse and abundant,” he 
said.Florida man looks at impacts

The City of Gainesville Public Works de-
partment is preparing for the next phase in 
an active reconstruction project on Depot Av-enue that will affect bus routes.
The second of four segments will start 
sometime in May and add a peanut-shaped roundabout where Depot Avenue, Southwest 11th Street and Southwest Ninth Road meet, said project manager John Veilleux. 
The construction from this phase will af-
fect the 126 and 127 Regional Transit System bus routes, RTS spokesman Chip Skinner wrote in an email.During the project, the 126 and 127 routes 
will no longer make stops on Southwest Ninth Street, Depot Avenue or Southwest 11th Street. Instead, the buses will go directly from Southwest 10th Street to the stops on Museum Road, Skinner said.
Contractors delayed the start of the proj-
ect, so no definitive start date has been estab-lished, Skinner said. 
The construction is expected to last for 
more than a year.
Students living in Oxford Terrace, Royal 
Village or in apartment complexes or houses in the surrounding area will need to meet the bus at different locations.
Oxford Terrace resident Brandon Johnson, a 20-year-old UF applied physiology and ki-nesiology sophomore, said the route change will inconvenience him.  
“Where the 127 currently picks up is a 
more central location to those residencies,” Johnson said.
Skinner said notices of the changes will 
be posted on the TransLoc app, the RTS Fa-cebook page and on board the 126 and 127 buses.
“The bus drivers will be reminding the 
patrons they normally see every day,” Skin-ner said. “We’ll also be putting notices on our website.”
Royal Village resident Abbey Patterson, a 
19-year-old UF advertising sophomore, said she’s upset about having to adjust her morn-ing schedule.
“I will still take RTS to class, but most 
likely not for early morning classes,” Patter-son said. “This will cause me to have to leave earlier to make it to the stop in time.”
Despite the detours, the project’s goal is to 
improve aesthetics and update the corridor, 
Veilleux said.

Florida Legislature 
is a mess
The in-state tuition bill that has received support from 
both Florida Republicans and Democrats hit a major roadblock Thursday night. Sen. Joe Negron, the sen-
ate budget chairman, said he would not add it to the agenda of the ﬁ  nal meeting of the Senate appropriations committee. 
Negron’s move was backed by Senate President Don Gaetz.
Sen. Jack Latvala, the Clearwater Republican sponsor-
ing the bill, said he was shocked that Negron and Gaetz are 
openly defying what the majority of the Senate wants. The bill would allow in-state tuition for those who attended a Florida high school three years before graduation, providing that any student seeking the tuition break could show proof that he or she had applied for citizenship. It received over-whelming bipartisan support in the House, passing at 81-33.
“What he has done is a slap in the face to our governor, 
who’s already announced support for this bill,” Latvala told the Miami Herald. “And it’s a slap in the face for the speaker who put a lot on the line. It’s a slap in the face to Jeb Bush,  who had been taking ﬁ  re from right wing Republicans across the country because he spoke of his convictions on immigra-tion.”
The Tampa Bay Times reported “Gaetz fretted that it 
could subsidize education for those who hail from countries 
that are ‘caldrons of terrorism and anti-American violence.’”
Gaetz’s racist statement shows a disturbing disconnect 
between himself and the students who would beneﬁ  t from 
this bill. His fantasy that those who would gain in-state tu-ition have some kind of anti-American agenda is simply lu-dicrous.
It’s also a spectacularly stupid move on Gaetz and Ne-
gron’s part: Florida voters will be hard-pressed to support a party that’s as fractured as the Florida GOP right now. Scott 
has clearly aligned himself with the bill. Of course, that’s 
an entirely different can of worms: According to the Miami Herald, “Scott’s turnabout is a vast change from 2010 when he urged a strong crackdown on illegal immigration. Scott’s move comes during an election year when Hispanic voters could play a key role in deciding his re-election.”
The fact that members of his own party are turning on the 
measure speaks to the ability of Florida Republican lawmak-ers to effectively govern this state.
Despite all the dirty politicking surrounding the in-state 
tuition bill, education equality should remain a top priority for Florida lawmakers. As a spokeswoman for UF’s chapter of the Hispanic Students Association told the Alligator last week, the conﬂ  ict lies in these particular two legislators’ fail-ure to represent their constituents’ needs.
It’s a stretch, but we hope Florida politicians can resolve 
the conﬂ  ict before this 60-day lawmaking session comes to a close on May 2. 
But then again, as Republican political consultant Fred 
Piccolo said, “Never underestimate the GOP’s ability to take a conservative winnable moment and blow it.”Summertime wantonness: Six hookup types
“I just wanna get laid,” lamented one of the characters in “Wet Hot American Summer.”
Don’t we all?
Summer is nearly upon us, and as such, I’ll cover some 
of the types of summer sex so you can have your own wet, 
hot, maybe-American summer.
1. The “I’m entering the real world in two weeks” 
hook-up
Consider the few weeks in between your last exam 
and your farewell to Gainesville as the last weeks of your 
youth, and it’s required that you have sex a few more times before graduation. This is the last time your body will ever be this attractive — and the last time it’s socially acceptable to get with a college freshman. Try to get it in 
a few more times before you actually have to ﬁ  gure out 
how health insurance works or what a 401(k) is.
2. The “I’m so fancy at this big internship I landed” 
hook-up
You’ve ﬁ  nally landed an internship that requires you 
to buy sensible heels or a suit that you didn’t wear to your middle-school dance. Your quasi-adult situation will make you feel mature. You’ll go out one night, order a scotch and gag as you drink it. You’ll think to yourself, 
“Adults can have responsible, casual sex!” and you’ll go 
home with the slightly older person next to you who says they work for a startup and can help you network. The sex isn’t great, but it’s worth it for the contacts.
3. The “I’m in a foreign country where the drinking 
age is 18” hook-up
You’ll fall for the ﬁ  rst person who looks exotic or has 
a sultry accent. You’ll ask them to talk dirty to you in their native tongue. Other countries are often more liberal 
about sex, and your new friend may even be into some 
things too kinky for America — hello, there’s a reason the Eiffel Tower position is named after a foreign landmark.
4. The “If you couldn’t tell by my Instagram, I’m at a 
music festival” hook-up
Your inhibitions will be a lot lower, and in a fog — and 
I mean a literal fog of marijuana smoke — of confusion, you’ll choose to get with some stranger in ﬂ  annel or cutoff shorts. Neither of you has show-ered in three days, and both of you are sunburned, so the sex is painful, but the mind-alter-ing drugs you’re on will make 
it memorable. Plus, you have 
some killer background music, and there’s something romantic about doing it in a tent next to thousands of other people. The 
ﬂ  ing will be short-lived, though — they want to see Chro-meo, but you sneer and head to the stage for Neutral Milk Hotel.
5. The “Being home is so great because my mom can 
cook for me again” hook-up
Presumably, if you’re back in your hometown for the 
summer, you’re staying with your parents. In that case, every night is a Throwback Thursday, reminding you of old high school memories of trying to hook up in your bedroom without your parents ﬁ  nding out, and prob-ably without both partners’ braces getting caught on each other. You’ll see the same people you went to high school with, so no matter how hard you try, you will most likely 
hook up with an old ﬂ  ame. Hopefully you’ve learned a 
few new tricks at the good old U of F, or else it’ll be just as awkward as it was in high school.
6. The “I can’t believe I’m stuck in Gainesville for the 
summer” hook-up
And then there’s us sad souls. This will be my ﬁ  rst 
summer here, and when I asked people what it’s like in Gainesville over the off-months, most people just gave me a pitying look. We have a few things on our side, though. 
We get to be the ﬁ  rst group to give the old “college wel-
come” to the incoming freshmen. And if you’re really des-perate, there are ACRs here year-round. Your standards can dip a little — with no one else here to see your choice in booty call, it’s OK if you settle for a 6 instead of an 8.

As shocking as it may seem, the dev-
astation and horror of World War II ended nearly 70 years ago.  The 
world has changed considerably in the de-cades that followed, but recent events re-mind us just how fresh some of the wounds of that era remain. A deranged man went into a Jewish Community Center near Kan-sas City with the intent of killing Jews just prior to the start of Passover. He opened ﬁ  re, killing three people — none happened to be Jewish — before shouting “Heil Hitler” after police had him in custody.
Aside from the terrifying reminder that 
white supremacists continue to target Jews in our own country, many saw news last week that sounded all too familiar. Pam-phlets were distributed in eastern Ukraine ordering all Jewish people to register with the government or face losing their citizen-ship. Many called into question the origin of the pamphlets, and as of this writing, no one is exactly sure who is responsible. One thing is sure: Nearly 70 years after six million Jew-ish people met their end at the hands of Hit-ler and the Nazis, anti-Semitism is alive and well.
After the Holocaust, Jewish 
people deﬁ  antly said, “Never again,” but here we are: Almost 15 years into the 21st century, we’re still dealing with anti-Semitism on the front page of the newspaper.
Regardless of the origin of 
the pamphlets — many do not believe they came from a government entity — we should not ignore the fact that Jewish people remain targets of hatred throughout the world, and no matter what tragedy strikes, there are some who will not stop until they eradicate the world of Jewish people. 
What we need to realize is that even in 
our interconnected world, some human be-ings still want to do horrible things to oth-ers, and even in our interconnected world, many of us ignore the signs. We can brush off the pamphlets in Ukraine as nothing more than a small group trying to push the tension there beyond the breaking point, but we have a responsibility to acknowledge that racism, anti-Semitism, sexism, homophobia and other forms of hatred exist.
We can ignore it or call it a 
symptom of another time. But those who would simply say it’s nothing more than a plati-tude spouted by leftist politi-cians need to look no further 
than recent headlines to prove that fallacy wrong. 
For the good of humanity, it’s up to 
our generation to end the stupidity that’s plagued humanity. If someone looks, acts or believes something different than us, we still have a difﬁ  cult time processing the fact that they are made of ﬂ  esh and blood, not unlike ourselves.
No group of human beings is superior 
due to its race, religion, ethnicity, gender or sexual orientation. On the other hand, the superior human beings are those who un-derstand that while we might be different, we should respect, honor and applaud our differences, not make offensive remarks, call on others to register with the government or resort to violence.
Last week, I discussed Hank Aaron and 
how he felt about racism today. Unsurpris-ingly, his remarks created a ﬁ  restorm, and what was the response from some? Vitriolic ﬁ  lth spewed forth from the mouths of petty individuals incapable of respecting someone simply based on the color of his skin. 
Just like in the 1970s, Aaron and the At-
lanta Braves received hate mail that includ-ed racial slur after racial slur.
Say what you want about liberals or the 
media pushing the idea that hatred still ex-ists and that it’s nothing more than a ﬁ  gment of our imaginations, but day after day, we see evidence that points to the contrary. Ha-tred and fear are very much alive in 2014, and after centuries of hatred, isn’t it about time that we stood up and did something about it?

Tomorrow will be too 
late. We need to re-duce our waste now. 
Almost every environmen-tal issue we face goes back 
to overconsumption. In the 
U.S. alone, 40 percent of food today goes uneaten, according to the Nation-al Resources Defense Council. That’s not only the equivalent of $165 billion of food Americans are wasting each year, but there is also the problem of environmental damage caused by its production and disposal.
We are wasting our food, resources, 
energy and money pointlessly. When was the last time you threw away food? You, too, have been a culprit of damaging the environment.
We created this problem.We need to ﬁ  x it for the sake of to-
morrow. We always hear about envi-ronmental problems across the globe. 
Rarely do we take the chance to help 
the environment. Now is the time.
In 2000, roughly 3,800 calories were 
distributed to each person daily, ac-cording to the United States Depart-ment of Agriculture. Out of those calories, about 1,000 were lost. That’s about a Big Mac meal with a Coke and French fries wasted every day per per-
son.
Disposed food contaminates the 
planet. Food waste is a major source 
of methane. According to the U.S. En-vironmental Protection Agency, meth-ane is a “potent greenhouse gas with 21 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide.”
Methane is not the only gas damag-
ing our environment. EPA experts cal-culate that about 13 percent of the total greenhouse gases in the U.S. are linked to the food industry. Let’s remember that the garbage produced in the U.S. alone could cover the state of Texas two and a half times.The extensive manufac-
turing of food also increas-es the amount of pesticides released in the environ-ment. Pesticides contain 
other elements that can 
create environmental damages such 
as impairment of water quality. Each year, diminishing our consumption could reduce the use of millions of pounds of pesticides.
Some would argue that a grow-
ing population means bigger waste. However, this is not reasonable pre-
cisely because we have an increasing 
demand with limited resources and space. More than seven billion people are currently living on this planet, and more will come. It’s unjustiﬁ  able that an American citizen wastes about 10 times as much food as someone in Southeast Asia, according to NRDC.
We should fund local campaigns to 
encourage recycling and turning food waste into compost. By doing this, we can help the soil’s structure and health, reduce the need for artiﬁ  cial fertilizers and increase drought resistance. Plus, we would save money.
For ﬁ  ve years, the U.K. has been 
conducting a public awareness cam-paign called “Love Food Hate Waste,” 
which has contributed to an 18-percent 
reduction in avoidable food waste.
Overconsumption leads to pollution 
and increases pesticides and green-house gases involved in global warm-ing. The needless food production can also negatively affect the environment as companies continue to expand. Mak-ing the right decisions when shopping 
can directly beneﬁ  t our future. In fact, 
according to NRDC, 2014 is the “Euro-pean year against food waste.”
Let’s bring that motto home and 
make it our own.

Speaking OutThere was a time when I as-
sumed everyone felt the same way toward writing as 
I do. However, through speaking to different people, I have discov-
ered that writing is not the savior to everyone 
else as it is to me. Writing is my solace, but to some others, it is a hindrance.
I write every day — whether it is a paper for 
American literature, an inspiring quote to help me through the day or a chapter for my novel. To not write would feel foreign to me. Without words, I would be lost. I’m a wordsmith, and to abandon words is to abandon part of what 
makes me whole.
I use words in so many different ways. They 
are my means of expressing difﬁ  cult emotions, 
exploring the inner reaches of my mind and making me feel more connected to others. Writ-ing doesn’t have to be the solitary pursuit that everyone makes it out to be. I’m lucky enough to have made friends all over the world through our shared love of the written word. I have writing buddies in Eng-
land, Australia, Canada and states throughout America. We support each other in ways that our nonwriter friends are unable to.
So, what does writing mean to you? Is it an 
escape, something you do when nothing else seems to be going right? Or would you rather slam your ﬁ  ngers in a door instead of placing them on computer keys (or typewriter keys, if you’re vintage like that)? Writing is part of me. 
It is my essence, something that can sum me up 
like few other words can. I’m a writer, and I al-ways will be.

When one ﬁ  nally goes 
back after many months away, his 
or her hometown seems to become the jealous ex who, 
seething from the breakup, decides to 
bombard you with the awkward reality of returning home.
The overwhelming excitement of par-
ents over your return and the pure joy apparent on your parents’ faces as you pull into the driveway is that of a child’s after he or she drew a beautiful work on 
a wall: naïve enthusiasm. 
Little does the child realize the 
mother is not pleased that she now has 
to bleach the wall. Little do the parents remember you were a pure headache in high school.
Most personal items have been relo-
cated. Whether your personal belong-ings followed you to college or were 
moved into a dark, Harry Potter-esque 
corner of some closet, they are no longer where they once were.
The majority of hometown friends have moved. Most high school graduates ﬂ  y from the nest shortly after gradu-ation, but your high school friends weren’t supposed to. 
You are upset to ﬁ  nd that they no longer reside in the houses that became yours over years of best friendship. How dare they move away to have a life and be successful.
Running into people from high 
school is always a thoroughly awkward event because unless you were BFFs in 
high school, the odds are that you have 
no desire to speak to or even see this person. It’s not necessarily that they were your enemy, but they know too much. They were present when you had braces, frizzy hair, glasses — and not the popular, hipster ones — and a Liz Clai-borne backpack. There is no reason to be reminded of those harsh visions.

A recent study shows preference for re-
ligion is declining, and its decline may be 
partly caused by the Internet.
Allen Downey, a professor of computer 
science at Olin College of Engineering, in 
Massachusetts, used statistical methods with 
data from the Higher Education Research Institute and the National Opinion Research Center in his research on the decline of reli-gious preference. 
In his research, Downey isolated Internet 
use as one of several factors contributing to religious disaffiliation.“People who reported a few hours a week 
of Internet use were less likely to report a re-ligious preference, by about two percentage points,” he wrote in an email.  
He added that people who use the Inter-
net more than seven hours per week were less religious by an additional three percent-age points. The total decrease in religious af-filiation between 1980 and 2010 was about 25 million people, he said.
Downey speculated the Internet is con-
tributing to the decline of religion by allow-ing more access to information and more communication among people with differ-ent beliefs.
People with religious doubt are able to access other people in similar circumstances all over the world via websites such as Red-dit, he said.
David Hackett, a UF associate professor 
of religion, said the research might reflect what is happening to organized religion but not to spirituality. 
“The number of people who go to church, synagogue or some sort of formal participa-
tion in organized worship has certainly de-
creased in recent years,” he said. “On the other side, there has been an increase in what people are calling spirituality.”  
Hackett said the Internet is probably con-
tributing to a decrease in organized religion by causing people to disconnect with each other.
Hackett sees a continued decline of or-
ganized religion in years to come but an in-crease in individualized religion and spiri-tuality.
“Religion is going to be very individual-
ized,” he said. “Spirituality is going to be far more triumphant than organized religion.”

� THE SHIP CONTAINED 
TWO TONS OF FOOD.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
CAPE CANAVERAL — 
Space station astronauts got a 
special Easter treat: a cargo ship full of supplies.
The shipment arrived Sun-
day morning via a Dragon, ver-sus a bunny.
“Gentlemen, the Easter 
Dragon is knocking at the door,” NASA’s Mission Con-trol said as the capsule was bolted into place.
The SpaceX company’s 
cargo ship, Dragon, spent two 
days chasing the International 
Space Station following its launch from Cape Canaveral. Astronauts used a robot arm to capture the capsule 260 miles above Egypt.
More than two tons of food, spacewalking gear and experi-ments fill the Dragon, including mating fruit flies, a little veggie hothouse and legs for the resi-
dent robot. NASA also packed 
family care packages for the six spacemen.
On Wednesday, the stakes 
will be even higher when the two Americans on board con-duct a spacewalk to replace a dead computer. 
The SpaceX delivery wasn’t 
exactly express. The launch was delayed more than a month. A minor communication problem cropped up during Sunday’s rendezvous, but the capture still took place on time and with success.
SpaceX flight controllers, at 
company headquarters in Haw-
thorne, Calif., exchanged high-
fives, shook hands, applauded and embraced once Japanese astronaut Koichi Wakata snared the Dragon with the station’s hefty robot arm.Easter delivery for

UF is sending the largest group ever to the USA Sci-
ence and Engineering Festival in Washington, D.C.
The 24-member group will represent UF at the larg-
est STEM festival in the country from April 25 to 27.
This year’s representatives are undergraduates cho-
sen from various student societies, said Nancy Ruzycki, 
the director of undergraduate laboratories at UF.
In the past, there were a few graduate students and 
a couple different displays that would be up all day, she said. This year, the student groups will be doing rota-tions of two hours a day at a 30- by 10-foot booth.
Eight clubs will be represented, including the Society 
of Women Engineers, the UF Rocket Team, the Society of Hispanic Engineers, the Society of Physics Students 
and the American Nuclear Society.
Ruzycki said UF organizers tried to pick clubs with 
broad memberships that were not unique to one depart-
ment. A lot of times academia does not represent the Student Body at large, she said, and the idea is to show-case the diversity not only in what students learn, but what they do. 
The university is providing transportation in the 
form of two vans, housing, materials for their experi-ments and the banners for each club. 
The total cost of the trip is about $13,000, said Ata Sa-
rajedini, an associate dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. The funds are being provided by CLAS, the College of Engineering, the Provost’s office and the admissions office. 
He said the switch to a group of all-undergraduate 
students is a move intended to draw more attention to UF’s booth. 
“Obviously students are our best ambassadors,” Sa-
rajedini said.
The festival will include a section where the students 
can do activities with children, a display area and a talk and demonstration area, Ruzycki said.
“The crowd is primarily young people, so rather than 
have adults talking at them, they’re going to have stu-dents that more closely resemble themselves to look at and listen to about all the exciting things that go on at the University of Florida,” she said.UF students to head to D.C. for

Hannah Rogers pitched 
a one-hitter in Florida softball’s win against Texas A&M. Read the 
story on page 13.Gators in the NBA
In his team’s 102-93 Game 1 victory over Chicago on Sunday, Washington Wizards guard Bradley Beal scored 13 points on 3-of-11 shooting. Meanwhile, Bulls center Joakim Noah recorded 10 points and 10 boards.� SOPHOMORE POSTED A 9.9375 
IN BARS FINALS.
JORDAN MCPHERSON
Alligator Writer @J_McPherson1126
After No. 1 Florida earned a share of its 
second-straight national title on Saturday, 
Bridget Sloan won a title of her own.The sophomore All-American became 
the 2014 NCAA uneven bars champion af-
ter posting a 9.9375 in the individual events 
finals in the Birmingham-Jefferson Conven-tion Complex on Sunday.
The victory marked Sloan’s third indi-
vidual national title — the most by a Florida gymnast — after she claimed the balance beam (9.900) and all-around (39.600) titles in 2013. UF now has an individual event win-ner in each of the past four seasons. 
With the win on Sunday, Sloan posted 
meet-high or meet-high-tying scores on the bars eight different times this season.
In addition to Sloan’s title on bars, the 
Pittsboro, Ind., native also tied for the sixth-best score on vault with a 9.9167.
The sophomore’s outing came one day 
after Florida tied Oklahoma in the national championship with a score of 198.175 — the highest recorded score since the champion-ship began in 1982.
Sloan was a key factor for the Gators in 
the Super Six, with all four of her routines earning scores of at least 9.900 on Saturday. But the all-arounder struggled in the post-season meets heading up to the national championship.
After winning at least a share of nine-
straight all-around titles, the beam got the best of Sloan late when it mattered most.
The sophomore fell on beam during both 
the University Park Regional on April 5 and the semifinals on Friday, resulting in respec-tive scores of 9.225 and 9.200 — her two low-est totals of the season.
But Sloan rebounded on beam in the 
championship meet — scoring a 9.950 on the apparatus Saturday to tie for the meet-high with Nebraska’s Emily Wong.
“Coming in (Saturday) personally, I had 
a lot of proving to do,” Sloan said in a post-game interview Saturday. “I didn’t really have that great of a night (in the semifinals), so … my team had so much trust in me and I kind of lost that. And when I got up there on the equipment, it wasn’t ‘Oh, man, am I going to make this?’ It was ‘I’m going to hit this routine, not just for myself, but for my 
team.’”
Seniors Mackenzie Caquatto and Alaina 
Johnson also competed on bars and beam 
during the individual events on Sunday.
Caquatto finished fourth on bars — a ca-
reer-high finish in individual finals — after posting a 9.8875 score. 
The Naperville, Ill., native also placed 12th 
on the balance beam with a score of 9.8375.
In her career, Caquatto competed in the 
individual events in each of the past three years, advancing to the finals for bars in 2012, 2013 and 2014 while competing on beam in each of the last two years.
Johnson — who took the uneven bars title 
last season — had to settle for a sixth-place finish in the event on Sunday with a 9.850 total. The Tyler, Texas, senior also finished 
tied for 10th place on the balance beam with 
a 9.850 score.
The senior all-arounder reached the indi-
vidual event finals in each of her four years at UF, winning the uneven bars event in 2013 with a 9.9125 final score.

With fewer than 24 hours sepa-
rating Florida’s first and final game 
of the series against Georgia, the Gators’ bats came on strong Satur-day and stayed hot through Sun-
day’s afternoon contest.
Florida (27-13, 12-6 Southeastern 
Conference) sealed its first three-
game series sweep against Georgia (21-18-1, 7-10-1 SEC) since 2010 with its 10-3 victory on Sunday. Given a 7-1 lead after just two innings, soph-omore Danny Young held the Bull-
dogs in check until the sixth inning 
when relievers Justin Shafer and A.J. Puk took the reigns and sealed the win.
“I think the tone was set early on 
today,” coach Kevin O’Sullivan said after UF captured its sixth straight victory. “I’m really pleased that we followed up the first inning with a 
really good second inning. That of-fensively distanced us a little bit 
early.”
Despite the lopsided score, the 
game was actually a comeback for the Gators, who were quickly in the hole after the Bulldogs knocked around Young in the first for a run off two hits.
Florida answered immediately 
behind Harrison Bader’s two-RBI triple and Braden Mattson’s sacri-fice fly. With the score now 3-1 in 
Young’s advantage, the sophomore southpaw set-
tled down and 
breezed through 
the second frame 
with two strike-outs and a nifty defensive stop of his own.
For the next 
three innings, Young allowed one more run off five hits and no walks. Although O’Sullivan said Young’s 
eight total hits in five innings of work was too much, he said he was 
pleased that his defense could help limit the runs while his offense pro-
vided plenty at the plate.
Bader plated Florida’s first two 
runs of the game with a two-RBI tri-
ple in the first then added to his day the very next frame by recording an RBI single. The sophomore center fielder finished the day 3 for 3 with a season-high three RBIs, a walk and a hit-by-pitch.

After winning its first two 
games against No. 21 Texas A&M 
on Friday and Saturday, No. 5 
Florida looked to earn its second 
straight Southeastern Conference sweep.
Hannah Rogers made it hap-
pen.
The senior right-handed pitch-
er threw a one-hit shutout as the Gators (40-8, 11-7 SEC) topped the Aggies (29-17, 9-12 SEC) 8-0 
in six innings in College Station, 
Texas.
“To me, that’s as good as 
Hannah Rogers has ever looked 
with all of her pitches,” coach 
Tim Walton said in a radio in-terview. “You know, some days she has one pitch going, but to-day she had everything working. 
She struck out the first seven in a 
row. Just give her credit for her hard work and she really did a good job putting together her 
own scouting report and plan to 
go pitch, too.”
Rogers was on the verge of the 
no-hitter.
With UF ahead 8-0 in the bot-
tom of the sixth inning against TAMU and a mercy rule looking imminent, the Lake Wales native kept her composure in the circle.
Rogers took out Texas A&M’s 
first two batters of the frame with ease just as she had all game, with Aggies first baseman Jenna Stark lining out to Rogers and pinch hitter Kaydee Rayburn ground-ing out to shortstop.
The senior ace needed just one 
more out to secure her second no-hitter of the season and the fourth of her career, but TAMU pinch 
hitter Abby Donnell stopped that from happening.
The freshman, pinch-hitting 
for Aggies shortstop Taran Tyler, 
ripped a single up the middle to 
give TAMU its first and only hit 
of the game.
Rogers finished the contest 
giving up just the one hit while 
striking out a season-high-tying nine batters — including the first seven she faced. The senior be-
came just the third SEC pitcher to accumulate 20 wins this season, dropping her ERA to a 1.69 in the process.
“I’ve been working hard, 
throwing more in the bullpen,” Rogers said in a release. “I’m focusing on spots and location, 
whether it’s high, low or in the 
zone for each pitch. I’m working on reading the batter in the box 
and little things like that.”
Kelsey Stewart and Stephanie 
Tofft paced the Gators on offense 
on Sunday by going a combined 7 for 8 at the plate. 
Stewart opened up the game 
with a solo home run to right field on a full count and then logged doubles in the second and 
fifth frames to bring her season 
total to 12 — the best mark on the team.
Tofft batted .700 throughout 
the series against Texas A&M and 
was the lone player to hit a home 
run in each of the three contests. The senior third baseman scored 10 RBIs on the weekend to give 
her a team-leading 51 in 2014.
“The way we’re swinging the 
bats right now, at least the way 
we show we’re swinging the bat the last two weeks, I think we’ve 
got the confidence back that we 
needed,” Walton said.
In the series, the Gators forced 
two run-rule contests while out-
scoring the Aggies 30-5.
UF went .400 at the plate as a 
team and outhit TAMU 36-14 on 
the weekend with nine of its hits being home runs.
“We came in, probably 
watched as much video or game film I think that we’ve watched in a long time,” Walton said. “I 
think we knew their personnel 
pretty well, and I think our hit-ters did a good job coming in 
with a game plan.”

this report.

Entering the season with only two se-
niors left and 11 freshmen dominating the 
roster, UF had something to prove.
And after a 15-2 season and a 6-0 record 
in the American Lacrosse Conference, No. 
4 Florida did just that.
With a 13-12 win at No. 5 Northwestern 
(9-5, 3-3 ALC) on Saturday, Florida sealed 
the ALC title outright for the first time since 2012. 
The Gators proved that being a young 
team does not mean anything as long as there is talent and chemistry.
Before UF’s season-opener at UNC, 
freshman Sammi Burgess said the goal was to show people what the newest class of freshmen could do on the field.
Her praise for freshmen like Taylor 
Bresnahan, Caroline Fitzgerald and Mollie Stevens shows what a team full of athletic players — rookies and seniors — can do if they work hard and focus.
“It’s a combination of everyone,” coach 
Amanda O’Leary said. “This team has worked really, really hard to achieve the success it’s had. And it doesn’t come eas-ily. 
“They do it for each other. I think that’s 
a huge piece to the puzzle because they en-joy being around each other. If you asked them, this would be what they’ve worked so hard for.”
In Florida’s win over Northwestern, it 
became a test of the team’s ability to adapt and react.
While the Gators held the lead for the 
entire game, the Wildcats continued to 
make up four- and five-point deficits when 
they were needed most.
The final play of the game was one that 
had both Florida and Northwestern fans on their feet. 
With 14 seconds to play, Florida sopho-
more defender Sidney DuPre was forced out of bounds and handed the ball over to Northwestern’s Kara Mupo, who then 
drove up an open lane to Florida’s sopho-
more keeper Mary-Sean Wilcox and sunk the ball into the back of the net.
In the few seconds after the tying goal, 
Florida’s bench was silent.
It was in the moments of shock that the 
other shoe dropped and Florida dodged the biggest bullet of the game: Mupo had crossed into the crease and Northwestern’s 
goal would not be allowed.
“I thought that we did the best we could 
with the options we had,” O’Leary said. 
“Thank goodness she (Mupo) stepped into the crease and we got the ball back.” 
Mupo’s error allowed Florida to get the 
ball back and hold on for the last 10 sec-onds. Burgess then pedaled momentum into the sputtering offense.
Burgess, who put four goals on the 
board for Florida against Vanderbilt on April 13, came out and put another four goals in the back of Northwestern’s net and recorded an assist to close the day with five points.“She scored the goals when we needed 
them most,” O’Leary said. “When it started to get close, she went out there and scored 
those big goals and, you know, that’s a 
big burden for a freshman. She certainly hasn’t played like a freshman.”
Junior Shannon Gilroy added two goals 
on eight shots and an assist for the Gators, 
while sophomore Devon Schneider scored 
three goals.MONDAY, APRIL 21, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 13

LAcroSSeFlorida clinches ALC title outright with victory at NorthwesternBader, who was 1 for 7 in the previous two games 
against the Bulldogs, said with how often slumps are a 
part of the game, it is important to learn how to rebound and recover in time for the next matchup.
“I was having a tough weekend during the first cou-
ple of games, but I was just trying to find some barrel and go up and help the team any way I can,” Bader said.
Casey Turgeon chipped in offensively as well by 
going 2 for 4 with two RBIs coming off a fifth-inning homer.
The Gators’ leadoff hitter scored all three times he 
reached base Sunday after only finding the basepaths twice over the first games of the series.
“It was a tough turnaround today,” the junior second 
baseman said. “We had two games yesterday, but we came out and 
played a good game today.”
The 21 total runs over the weekend are the most the 
Gators have had all season in a three-game series. And although the scoreboard indicates Florida had two er-rors, O’Sullivan still said he was pleased with the defen-sive effort after the Gators recorded four double plays to help bail out their pitchers.
The Bulldogs managed to outhit the Gators 14-10 on 
Sunday and 17-15 in the first two games Saturday, but they also left 24 runners on base compared to the Gators’ 
15 stranded players.
“You’ve got a chance to win three games, that doesn’t 
happen very often,” O’Sullivan said. “You’ve got to play 
good baseball and you’ve got to treat each game differ-ently and you can never be satisfied because the league is usually won or lost by one game.”

Florida set a new record on Friday, but it 
was probably one it is not too proud of.
For the first time in program history, the 
Gators were eliminated before reaching the 
Southeastern Conference tournament semi-
finals.
No. 8 Texas A&M (19-5) upset No. 4 
Florida (19-5) 4-3 in a rematch of an earlier regular-season meeting. 
The Gators swept the Aggies 4-0 in the 
matchup on Feb. 28, winning all but one singles match in straight sets.
That was not the case over the weekend, 
as TAMU grabbed the doubles point and captured the necessary three single matches 
to keep its championship hopes alive.
Florida had its fair share of chances de-
spite losing the doubles point. At one point, it led 2-1, and at another juncture, it held a 3-2 advantage. 
But sophomore Brianna Morgan, playing 
on Court 1, was unable to gain an edge on No. 11 Cristina Stancu and ceded the match point to the Aggies.
“The scores were telling,” coach Roland 
Thornqvist said. “We won one set that went past 4-0 in singles. But even on the courts 
where we had opportunities, we didn’t take 
advantage of them.”
Florida, the four-time defending SEC 
champions, fell to 69-8 all time in SEC Tour-nament play. It also lost the doubles point for the sixth time this year, falling to 1-5 
when losing the doubles point.
“We’ve worked quite a bit on becom-
ing less predictable in our doubles play,” Thornqvist said. 
“We’ve won a lot of trophies here by be-
ing durable in singles play, being consistent and perhaps on the conservative side in sin-
gles. So I think that’s hurt us a little bit in our doubles play the past few years. Although 
we don’t want to abandon what we’re try-
ing to do in singles, we do need to be more unpredictable in our doubles play.”14, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, APRIL 21, 2014

4-2 ON SUNDAY.

Alligator Writer @TheReporterGirl
After a long run, Florida (15-
9, 8-4 Southeastern Conference) 
fell 4-2 in the SEC Tournament 
championship game to Texas 
A&M (24-6, 10-2 SEC).
The Aggies entered the 
match playing strong from the 
beginning, winning the doubles 
point with victories on Courts 2 
and 3. 
The freshman duo of Maxx 
Lipman and Elliott Orkin fell 
first to No. 66 Harrison Adams 
and Shane Vinsant in a battle, 
8-6. 
Soon after, the No. 78 TAMU 
duo of Jeremy Efferding and Jordan Szabo defeated UF’s Mike Alford and Diego Hi-dalgo 8-4 to clinch the doubles 
point for the Aggies and give 
them a 1-0 advantage. 
“I thought Texas A&M came 
out strong and they got on us in 
a couple of the doubles, partic-
ularly No. 1 and No. 3, and did 
a nice job in the key moments 
of the matches,” coach Bryan 
Shelton said in a release.
In singles, the Gators ap-
peared to find momentum. Four of six Florida players 
won the first set of their singles 
matches. Despite the momen-tum change, TAMU’s Jackson Withrow was still able to defeat 
No. 92 Orkin 6-4, 7-5 to give the 
Aggies a 2-0 lead. 
Florida’s first point of the 
match came from  Florent Diep, 
who defeated No. 14-ranked 
Adams 6-3, 6-4. Minutes later,   
Lipman came up big for Flor-
ida, evening the match up at 
2 with his 6-3, 7-6 (5) win over 
No. 57 Efferding.
Lipman’s point was the last 
for the Gators. Both Gordon Watson and  Alford fell to their 
opponents. Watson fell to No. 
23 Shane Vinsant in three sets 
(1-6, 6-3, 6-0), while Alford fell 7-6, 6-3 to Szabo, who clinched  
the match and the 2013-2014 
SEC title for the Aggies.
“In singles play, our guys 
responded like they always do 
and came back,” Shelton said. “We were up in almost every 
set of the matches from 1-6. We 
had opportunities on 5 and 6 
where we didn’t win the set, but overall, I felt like we competed 
really hard. We just didn’t sus-
tain anything long enough to 
really get the match today.”
Despite the loss, Alford 
and Diep were both named to 
the 2014 SEC All-Tournament 
team.

won one set that went past 4-0 
in singles. But even on the courts 
where we had opportunities, we 
didn’t take advantage of them.”

For the first time this outdoor season, the field athletes 
outperformed the track stars.
Five out of the eight event victories the Gators won at the Tom Jones Memorial Invite at Percy Beard Track came 
from the field, as Kyle Strawn led the way with a career-best performance. 
Strawn, who was named the Southeastern Conference 
Co-Athlete of the Week on April 8, surpassed his personal best set at the Florida Relays with a 68.18-meter hammer throw on Saturday.
“I was happy to have a personal best, especially on my 
last throw,” Strawn said. 
“Usually, I throw my best throw on the first or sec-
ond throw of the competition and it kind of goes downhill 
from there.
“It’s nice to build a little bit. The conditions weren’t 
ideal — it was rainy and really cold so definitely happy 
how things turned out.”
The junior thrower’s mark at the Tom Jones Invite is 
the second-best record on the UF all-time list in the ham-mer throw. 
Coach Mike Holloway said Strawn and throws coach 
Steve Lemke have improved at working together after 
taking a year to get used to each others’ styles. 
“He’s working hard, doing good things,” Holloway 
said. “When he wants to be a force at the national meet 
he’s headed in that direction.”
In addition to Strawn’s performance, thrower Jayla 
Bostic, jumper Taylor Burke and thrower Marija Vucen-ovic all turned in first-place finishes.
Burke, competing in the women’s high jump, leaped 
to a 1.74-meter victory on her second attempt. Although Burke won the event, she thought she could have per-formed better throughout her three jumps.
Agata Strausa, Cory McGee and Rebekah Greene all 
turned in a podium finish in the women’s 800-meter run. 
Strausa (2:04.67), a senior distance runner, crossed the 
line ahead of the other 15 competitors to take the victory in the 800m and fell shy of the track record of 2:01.35 set in 1992. 
The Gators now have two weeks to prepare for the LSU 
Invitational in Baton Rouge, La.
“You have to get healthy and take care of some things,” 
Holloway said. 
“The big thing now is just to get ready for LSU in a 
couple of weeks and conference a couple of weeks after that. We have some people who are a little dinged up.”

After a shortened first round of 
play Friday night, coach Emily Gla-
ser concluded a release by saying, 
“You never know what can hap-
pen.”
Her words rang true two days 
later after the No. 19 Gators finished 
the Southeastern Conference Cham-
pionship on Sunday 49-over-par with a player in the top five and a player in last place. UF finished tied for 10th place out of 14 teams.
Although only three teams stood 
between Florida and the bottom of the leaderboard, the 913 (+49) finish was a marked improvement from its 
88-over-par finish in 2013.
Freshman Maria Torres, playing 
in her first postseason tournament, 
led the team with three consistent rounds of play at the Greystone Golf 
and Country Club in Birmingham, 
Ala. 
With her score increasing by one 
stroke each day and an eagle in the 
final hole of Round 3, Torres earned 
the first top-five finish of her colle-giate career by tying with Alabama’s Stephanie Meadow and Janie Jack-
son for fifth place at 219 (+3).
“Maria fought hard today after 
her own tough start, and her three 
birdies coming in on the back nine really showed what kind of a com-petitor she is,” Glaser said in a re-lease. “She had a great SEC Tourna-ment and led our team.”
Despite Glaser’s assurance that 
Florida is “a good enough team to score better on this golf course,” junior Sarah Schober was the only 
other player besides Torres to place 
in the top 25 with five total birdies and an even-par finish in the third round.
“It was a disappointing day for 
our team,” Glaser said. “We got off to a terrible start through about six 
holes and were never able to re-
bound.”
Freshman Karolina Vlckova and 
senior Elcin Ulu finished within two strokes of each other, with scores of 
233 (+17) and 235 (+19), respective-
ly. While Vlckova fell from an even par Round 2 finish, Ulu consistently stayed between 6- and 7-over-par 
and finished eight strokes and two 
places ahead of her performance last year.
Camilla Hedberg was first in the 
lineup and last in the leaderboard, scoring at least three double bogeys in each round. The junior finished 
the tournament 40-over-par, a se-
vere drop from her 16-over-par fin-ish in 2013.
“It was a humbling week,” Gla-
ser said. “But we have some impor-tant golf left to play this season and 
we will turn our attention to the fu -
ture.”

UF coachAdding the dropped score for 
each event to the ﬁ  nal team total 
broke Friday night’s tie. 
UF’s six-score total of 236.35 
was just barely higher than Ala-bama’s (236.10). 
Both teams joined Nebraska, 
Oklahoma, Georgia and LSU in Saturday’s Super Six. 
But the tiebreaker gave Florida 
the advantage of competing an Olympic rotation of vault-bars-
beam-ﬂ  oor — the Gators’ order of 
events at home meets. 
“I deﬁ  nitely wouldn’t’ want to 
break the tie,” Bridgette Caquatto said of Saturday’s win. 
“It’s amazing to go up there 
and stand behind the ﬁ  rst place national champion team banner and cheer with another team next to you. You’re holding the tro-
phies and screaming and it makes 
it that much more fun and loving. 
“It’s awesome that we shared it 
with Oklahoma. They are a great team and I think it’s completely 
fair if everyone gets the same 
score.” 
With the Sooners already done 
competing, the pressure was on as 
Florida took to the ﬂ  oor in its ﬁ  nal 
event. 
Freshman Claire Boyce, who 
set her ﬂ  oor career high of 9.90 on Friday, scored a 9.875 as the ﬁ  rst 
Gator to compete on ﬂ  oor. 
After that, the Gators hit their 
stride. 
After Rachel Spicer, Alaina 
Johnson and Bridget Sloan scored 9.900s on their ﬁ  nal event, Florida 
trailed Oklahoma by 19.900 points with Kytra Hunter and Caquatto left to compete.
Hunter posted a 9.95, meaning 
Caquatto needed to tie her career-high on ﬂ  oor to give UF a share of the title. 
The sophomore delivered, 
scoring the needed 9.95 to tie the Gators with the Sooners. 
Florida’s ﬂ  oor score of 49.625 
was the team’s highest event to-tal.
“I had to calm myself down 
and ﬂ  ash back to those (10.0) 
routines and remember just how 
much fun I had during those rou-tines,” Hunter said. 
“[Friday’s] performance wasn’t 
my best and I think that deﬁ  nitely 
triggered some energetic moves.” 
In Friday’s meet, Hunter scored 
a season-low 9.775 on vault but 
managed to stay consistent on 
ﬂ  oor with a 9.90.
Things came full circle for the 
preseason No. 1 Gators on Satur-
day. 
Even with a freshman compet-
ing on two of the four events and only two seniors in the lineup, no Gator scored lower than a 9.825 in the meet. 
Florida’s team total of 198.175 
was UF’s third highest of the sea-
son. 
Oklahoma and Florida’s shared 
total of 198.175 is the highest ever 
in NCAA Championships his-
tory.Sloan scored a 9.900 or above 
on all four events on Saturday, but 
the sophomore said she wonders if Florida could have done better. 
“Coming in tonight, personally 
I had a lot of proving to do,” Sloan 
said. “I came in the mindset of not 
going to only do this for myself, but for my team. It’s crazy to look back and wonder what would have happened if we wouldn’t 
have put in all those extra work-
outs and conditioning.”
Hunter said the emotions were 
ﬂ  owing even before the team knew they had won. 
”I see and sensed the emo-
tions of the team. I saw Macko (Mackenzie Caquatto) crying and I thought, ‘Oh my gosh this is un-real,” Hunter said. 
“Everyone kind of calmed each 
other down and then once we knew that we won it was just, I don’t know, it feels like the ﬁ  rst title, honestly. It’s incredible. 
“It’s a great feeling and I wish 
that every athlete could feel the emotions that come with a nation-al championship.”
