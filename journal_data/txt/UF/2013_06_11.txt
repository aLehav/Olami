The sounds of the Krishna Lunch 
group’s tambourines and bongos served 
as the soundtrack for the 20-foot-tall couple’s last dance on the Plaza of the Americas.
The “Whispering Close” sculpture 
— the last remaining part of the $35,000 “Crossing Paths” exhibition by Seward Johnson that came to campus in June 2011 — was broken down into pieces and lifted by crane onto a truck that hauled them away.
Jenee Castellanos, associate curator of 
the Sculpture Foundation that loaned UF the statue, said the loan had expired. The piece will return to the artist’s studio in New Jersey for restoration. Castellanos said the loan on that particular statue — inspired by Impressionist painter Pierre-Auguste Renoir’s “Dance in the City” — was extended by the university due to positive feedback.
“It’s been here since I started at UF,” 
said Mitchell Smith, a 20-year-old UF food and resource economics sopho-more. “It’s been part of my experience here, and I hate to see it go.”
But not everyone felt the same way.In September 2011, Gainesville’s 
chapter of Students for a Democratic Society looped a bright yellow price tag around the landmark statue in protest of tuition hikes. Last Fall, LGBTQ-straight alliance organization OwnUp staged a queer Sadie Hawkins dance underneath it to protest heteronormativity.
Taylor Lilly, a 19-year-old UF natural 
resource conservation junior, said she was happy to see the statue leave.
“I hope they put something prettier 
there instead,” Lilly said. “It was kind of ominous and creepy.” VOLUME 107 ISSUE 152 WWW.ALLIGATOR.ORG TUESDAY, JUNE 11, 2013

� FLORIDA WON ITS SECOND STRAIGHT 
OUTDOOR NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP AND SHARED THE TITLE WITH TEXAS A&M.
   GORDON STREISAND

  Against all odds, the Gators are outdoor champi-
ons for the second consecutive season. 
  The Florida men’s track and ﬁ  eld team rallied 
Saturday to defend its NCAA outdoor title, this time 
sharing it with Texas A&M.
   “No one gave us a chance,” coach Mike Holloway 
said. “I watched the replays of ESPN this weekend and they didn’t even mention the Gators. I told the guys to just keep ﬁ  ghting, be who we are and do what we do.”
Heading into the last day of competition, UF was 
in 11th place. 
  After some disappointing results through the ﬁ  rst 
three days of competition, the odds of Florida defend-ing its title were dwindling. But the Gators’ conﬁ  -dence never wavered.  
  The ﬁ  rst scored event on Saturday was the men’s 
triple jump. Defending NCAA champion Omar Craddock made the cut to advance to the ﬁ  nal jumps, while sophomore Marquis Dendy did not.
  Having two individual athletes and two relay 
squads still eligible for points, the Gators went to work — starting with Craddock.
  The senior posted a personal best in the triple 
jump and secured 10 points for Florida, defending his individual title.   
  The next event for Florida was the men’s 4x100m 
relay. In the ﬁ  nal leg of the 4x1, sophomore Dedric Dukes edged out Alabama’s Dushane Farrier by one-hundredth of a second, winning the event for Florida in a season-best 38.53 seconds. 
  “I knew the title was on the line, so I just ran my 
hardest and we came out on top,” Hugh Graham Jr. said. “All the handoffs were smooth, and down the backstretch, I knew Dedric was one of the best guys out there and he would get it done for us.”

Despite Florida Gov. Rick Scott’s efforts to 
the contrary, tuition will increase this Fall.
UF Board of Trustees passed a regulation 
amendment last week that will raise under-
graduate resident students’ tuition by about $4.01 per credit hour, which totals about $120 each year. Of that, most UF students will pay about $30 — Bright Futures, which recently went up, covers most of the extra charge.
The board was obligated to comply with 
state statutes mandating a 1.7 percent annual adjustment for inﬂ  ation. The trustees were ret-icent to pass the higher tuition rate — trustee Christopher Corr even asked what would hap-pen if they broke the law.
“I’m really required to 
follow the law. The law may not be what everybody wants the law to be,”  chair-man David Brown said. “But it is, in fact, the law.”
Trustee Carolyn Roberts 
said the decision put the 
board in “a very uncomfortable position” be-cause she agreed with the governor’s consid-eration of Florida families.To lessen the blow of the tuition hike, the 
board agreed to put half of the resulting rev-enue toward need-based ﬁ  nancial aid and half toward campus maintenance.
“The administration tried every means 
possible to minimize the ﬁ  nancial impact of attending the University of Florida,” said UF President Bernie Machen.
Machen was the center of a different ﬁ  nan-
cial discussion when the board voted to raise his annual compensation to $725,492 — a pos-

AP Source: Tebow to sign with 
Patriots 
Tim Tebow may still have a 
future in the NFL after all.
The New England Patriots 
seem to think so and plan to sign 
him on Tuesday if he passes a ing “women’s clothes” if that’s 
what they want because it would be discrimination.
He didn’t rule out a change of 
the company’s uniform policy.
Mom gives birth in minivan in hospital driveway 
CHICAGO — Melissa Jones 
almost made it.
The suburban Chicago mom 
was heading to the hospital to 
give birth. She got as far as the hospital’s driveway, but her daughter just wasn’t going to wait any longer to come into the world. While nurses rushed out and her children looked on, Jones delivered her baby in the family’s minivan Thursday — just feet from the front door of Northwestern’s Prentice Wom-en’s Hospital in downtown Chi-cago. 
A doctor leaving work assist-
ed with the front-seat delivery, calling out for gloves and blan-kets.
“All I could do was hold onto 
the dashboard and the side of the car” and push, said 30-year-old Jones of Calumet City.
Earlier that evening, Jones 
was at work as a restaurant ca-shier at a downtown Chicago hotel when she started having contractions. She called her fian-ce, Marcus Ross, and asked him to come get her, then made sure one more customer got his order, a milkshake.
Meanwhile, Ross put the four 
children in the couple’s minivan and headed into the city. The plan was to head to the suburban hospital where they’d planned to deliver. His mother would meet them there and they’d hand off the children to her.
But it was soon clear the 
baby wasn’t going to wait long enough to get to the suburbs. With contractions getting stron-ger and closer, they drove to the Northwestern Memorial Hospi-tal campus and searched for the correct entrance.
Jones expects her daughter — 
6-pound-8-ounce Mariah Faith Ross — will be an unstoppable child because of the way she came into the world.
“She’s going to give me a run 
for the money,” Jones said. “She made a grand entrance.”
The other children, Jones said, 
now know for sure where babies come from.
— THE ASSOCIATED PRESSphysical.
He won’t be a starting quar-
terback, of course, with Tom Brady on hand in Foxborough. But certainly he’s an intrigu-ing reclamation project — yet another chance for coach Bill Belichick to torture the New York Jets, who failed to find a role for Tebow last season.
And that could make for 
quite a Boston Tea-bow Party.
A person familiar with the 
situation told The Associated Press on Monday that Tebow will join the Patriots’ minicamp Tuesday and sign with the team — pending the medical exam. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because no of-ficial announcement had been made. Even when Tebow signs, there is no guarantee he will play for the Patriots.
ESPN first reported that 
Tebow would sign with New England.
Asked if Tebow had signed, 
Patriots spokesman Stacey James said, “I do not anticipate any additional transactions to announce tonight.”
Revitalizing Tebow’s career 
would be another big step to-ward humiliating New Eng-land’s archrival.
Belichick values versatil-
ity in his players, having used wide receivers Troy Brown, Julian Edelman and Matthew Slater as defensive backs when injuries hit that position.
Belichick also has been will-
ing to gamble on players dis-carded by other teams. Some have succeeded, like wide re-ceivers Wes Welker and Randy Moss and running back Danny Woodhead. Some haven’t, in-cluding wide receiver Chad Johnson and defensive lineman Albert Haynesworth.
Swedish male train drivers 
wear skirts to work 
STOCKHOLM — Commut-
ers on a train line in northern 
Stockholm were met with an unusual sight this week: male train drivers and conductors wearing skirts to work.
Train driver Martin Aker-
sten says he and more than a dozen others at the Roslags-banan line have started wear-ing skirts in the summer as a protest against the train com-pany’s uniform policy, which doesn’t allow shorts.
The 30-year-old Akersten 
said Sunday the response from customers has been only posi-tive.
Arriva, the company that 
runs the train line, hasn’t stopped the drivers. Arriva spokesman Tomas Hedenius says the company wants its staff to look “nice and proper,” but can’t stop men from wear-PARTLY

A St. Petersburg man was 
arrested in Gainesville Sunday 
night after police say he ran out of a local Chinese restaurant without paying for dinner.
Ryland Wilcox Rogers, 26, 
consumed about $24 of food and drinks at Szechuan Palace, 2031 NW 13th Street, but his debit card was declined, ac-cording to the report.
Jenny Chenz, the restaurant’s 
co-owner, said Rogers told her he had some more money at his nearby apartment, so she and another female employee fol-lowed him there.
Rogers made the two women 
wait on the second ﬂ  oor while he climbed the stairs to his room on the third ﬂ  oor, Chenz said. 
Then, Rogers ran down an-
other ﬂ  ight of stairs to bypass the women and ran away, she said.
Later, GPD Ofﬁ  cer Daniel 
Abbott saw a man who matched Rogers’ description walking on Northwest 12th Street.
Abbott stopped the man and 
asked for identiﬁ  cation. When Rogers handed Abbott his pass-port, he said “I don’t want to go to jail,” according to the report.
Then, he ran.When Rogers tried to climb 
a 6-foot-tall privacy fence to get  into a backyard on Northwest 13th Avenue, Abbott tackled him, according to the report.
Rogers be-
gan to thrash violently to 
avoid being h a n d c u f f e d , and Abbott struck him and subdued him, according to 
the report.
Two other ofﬁ  cers helped 
handcuff Rogers, and he was arrested at about 8 p.m. on charges of defrauding to obtain food and resisting an ofﬁ  cer with violence.
He was taken to the Alachua 
County Jail, where he remained as of press time with bond of $6,000.
He told police that he’d in-
tended to pay for his meal, but he said staff members were “eyeing” him and made him feel uncomfortable, according to the report.Chinese food dinner

UF is developing an online institute
sible $750,500 if employee raises 
come through. His former total compensation had been $565,492.
His base salary was increased 
by $60,000 retroactive to Jan. 1, but that money is not from taxpayers. The Florida Legislature caps the public contributions to a public uni-versity president’s pay at $225,000. Machen’s new base salary will be $500,158, so non-public funds will pay for his raise. His term was also extended through the end of 2014.
That means Machen will be 
at UF for its state-designated cre-ation of the eCampus, an institute for online learning. UF Provost Joe Glover said by January 2014, eCam-pus hopes to offer ﬁ  ve bachelor’s degree programs: business, sports management, health education, criminology and law, and environ-mental management.
“We can only have 6,500 stu-
dents every year,” he said. “We’ve got 29- or 30,000 applications, so there’s clearly much more demand for access to University of Florida degrees. This is a way by which we can actually increase access.”Rogers

� STEIN MART IS SET TO 
CLOSE AUG. 27.
MICHAELA BISIENERE
Alligator Contributing Writer
Stein Mart, at 6111 Newberry 
Road, announced it will close its 
doors, and a new Hobby Lobby craft store is expected to take its place.
The Jacksonville-based depart-
ment store Stein Mart closes Aug. 27, said Linda Tasseff, the Stein Mart director of investor relations.
Tasseff said the decision to close 
the store was a business choice.
“We were at the end of a lease 
term, and the store wasn’t meeting expectations,” Tasseff said.
She said she couldn’t pinpoint 
the number for the job losses that will result from the store closing.
“We employ about 40 employ-
ees there,” Tasseff said. “We always do try to relocate people when pos-sible.”
Hobby Lobby Spokesman Vin-
cent Parker confirmed in an email that Gainesville residents can expect a Hobby Lobby in 2014. According to Alachua County Clerk of Court records, Hobby Lobby signed a memorandum of lease agreement with the current property owners.
Laurel Marois, a 19-year-old UF 
history junior, said she thinks the store will improve the selection of materials in Gainesville beyond what is currently available at local craft stores.
“We have a lack of craft stores, 
and there are a lot of people who do that kind of stuff,” said Marois, who frequently makes scrapbooks and crafts for her sorority sisters.
“People are all buying the same 
things, and orange and blue stuff is always sold out,” she said.
Maria Collins, a 20-year-old UF 
history junior, said she thinks Hob-by Lobby will be a better choice than Stein Mart for the location.
“I don’t usually shop there unless 
I’m with my mom,” Collins said. “Within my age group, most likely they wouldn’t be too sad (about the closing).”

Jury selection began Monday in the Semi-
nole County murder trial of George Zimmer-
man — a case that has sparked national debate for the past year.
Zimmerman, 29, was charged with second-
degree murder after Trayvon Martin, an un-armed black teenager,  was shot and killed in Sanford in February 2012. Zimmerman has pleaded not guilty, and he said he was just de-fending himself in a fight with Martin.
Zimmerman was the self-appointed neigh-
borhood watchman and called 911 several times with complaints of a suspicious black man.
Police did not initially arrest Zimmerman 
after the shooting because they said he was acting in self-defense.
Because racial stereotyping may have 
played a role in Martin’s death, the case has received national media coverage and brought attention to the “stand your ground” law, gun control and racial profiling.
With how high-profile the case has become, 
choosing the six jurors could take weeks.
Jennifer Zedalis, a UF Levin College of Law 
senior legal skills professor and director of trial practice, said it is difficult for someone to un-learn or set aside information they know about a trial, which makes jury selection difficult.
“Because of the national interest in the case, 
jury selection is very challenging,” she said. “You want to get jurors to hear a case who don’t come into the case with a strike against you already.”
To ensure a fair trial, lawyers are question-
ing possible jurors on what media they have consumed. They are also asked if they have ever participated in a rally, if they recognize any lawyers from TV and if they have strong feelings about the case.
Bob Dekle, a UF Levin College of Law se-
nior legal skills professor and criminal pros-ecution clinic director, said the trial itself could take longer than two weeks.
“It remains to be seen how it’s going to play 
out in front of a jury,” he said.
In Gainesville, several students have been 
vocal about their opinions about the shooting.
Skye Schmelzer, a 21-year-old UF history se-
nior and member of the Gainesville chapter of the Students for a Democratic Society, helped organize a local rally demanding justice for the Martin family.
Schmelzer said she was glad to see the trial 
begin but was upset Zimmerman’s defense team was trying to stereotype Martin.
The best thing that could result is that it 
sheds light on profiling, she said.
“Trayvon deserves justice,” Schmelzer 
said.Day 1 of Zimmerman trial sees

lies...”
Leaker reveals himself
This weekend, one of the greatest news leaks in the history 
of the United States took place.
As the ﬁ  rst week of military whistleblower Bradley 
Manning’s trials came to a close, 29-year-old Edward Snowden stepped forward as the leaker of material from the National Se-curity Agency. 
The material, which he gave to the British newspaper the 
Guardian, contains information about top-secret programs, in-cluding widespread domestic surveillance. The NSA, Snowden said, collects everyone’s information by default and even stores it for a time.  
“Any analyst at any time can target anyone, any selector any-
where,” Snowden said in  a video interview with the Guardian. “I, sitting at my desk, certainly had the authorities to wiretap anyone, from you, or your accountant, to a federal judge, to even the president, if I had a personal email,” he said. 
In the same interview, Snowden said the documents reveal 
that “the NSA routinely lies in response to congressional inqui-ries about the scope of surveillance in America.” 
“These things need to be determined by the public, not by 
somebody who was simply hired by the government,” Snowden said.
“I think that the public is owed an explanation of the moti-
vations behind the people who make these disclosures that are outside of the democratic model,” he said. “When you are sub-verting the power of government, that that’s a fundamentally dangerous thing to democracy.” 
So, why is so much data being unconstitutionally seized up 
in the ﬁ  rst place? Surely they must be doing it for our own good, we hope. Despite our hope, we understand the dangers of such unbridled power. A dystopian surveillance state may not be here quite yet, but the groundwork for one is laid: It’s only a matter of time before the wrong people get their hands on these powers.
Snowden said “And the months ahead, the years ahead, it’s 
only going to get worse...a new leader will be elected, they’ll ﬂ  ip the switch, say that ‘Because of the crisis, because of the dangers that we face in the world...we need more authority, we need more power.’ And there will be nothing the people can do at that point to oppose it, and it’ll be turnkey tyranny.”
Forty years ago, Daniel Ellsberg secretly photocopied classi-
ﬁ  ed documents and gave them to The New York Times. The cor-pus of documents was an unprecedented 7,000 pages and told a secret history of the Vietnam War. These are now known as the Pentagon Papers.
In an op-ed for the Guardian, Ellsberg wrote “In my estima-
tion, there has not been in American history a more important leak than Edward Snowden’s release of NSA material – and that deﬁ  nitely includes the Pentagon Papers 40 years ago.” 
From all of us at the Alligator, thank you, Daniel Ellsberg.A tired adage has been repeated by several ofﬁ  cials through-
out the course of the weekend with regard to surveillance: If you’re not doing anything wrong, then there’s nothing to fear.
Well, government, right back at you. Should you be able to wear blackface?
When two UF fraternity members wore blackface to 
a party in the fall of 2012, they sparked a campus-wide discussion about racism. Sadly, some stu-
dents strayed from this thoughtful dialogue by pushing for the university to ban blackface on campus.
It may sound strange to describe the proposed ban as 
sad, considering blackface is widely recognized as an igno-rant, racist symbol.
The calls for censorship are disheartening, though, be-
cause they suggest some students don’t appreciate an aspect of free speech: the difference between agreeing with how someone expresses himself and supporting his right to ex-pression.
Think of the First Amendment as a microphone in a kara-
oke bar. Some people use it in shameful ways, but as long as they’re not being extremely disruptive or violent, you have to let them sing. You’ll have your turn to deliver a comeback performance.
One problem with banning speech simply because it’s of-
fensive is that the ban may swoop up other forms of expres-sion. For example, a blanket ban on blackface could prevent students who produce plays and movies from using the cos-tume as social commentary.
This principle popped up recently as I was talking to my 
friend, who is gay, about a case involving homophobic pro-testers. In 2006, members of the Westboro Baptist Church protested the funeral of a U.S. Marine, waving signs that read “God hates f--s.” 
The Marine’s father sued the church’s founder and a few 
other protesters, claiming they meant to cause him extreme emotional distress. My friend and I agreed the signs had tor-mented the father. Given the facts, we were initially shocked to learn the Supreme Court ruled 8-1 in the church’s favor. 
Westboro protested peacefully on a sidewalk about three 
football ﬁ  elds away from the funeral. The subject of their protest — gay Americans serving in the military — was con-sidered a social and political issue, a type of speech strongly protected by the First Amendment.Although Westboro’s signs 
were evil, the Supreme Court 
would have contributed to an even greater evil if it had set a precedent for interfering with legal protests. The Westboro ruling and last fall’s blackface case taught me that de-fending our freedom of speech isn’t always easy. Sometimes we 
have to let the values of the Constitution override our per-sonal opinions, which means sticking up for others’ freedom to verbalize seemingly ignorant and frustrating ideas.
“Wait a minute,” you might think. It’s one thing to defend 
speech that serves a purpose, but there’s no value in waving a homophobic sign or wearing blackface on Halloween.
In these cases, when symbols and words appear to lack 
value, we have to remember that value is subjective. If you’ve ever been in a heated debate about an issue like gun control or abortion, you’ve probably met folks across the political aisle who thought your ideas were worthless. Fortunately, their assessment alone can’t stop you from speaking.
Because the display of blackface last fall was protected 
by the First Amendment, the right thing to do was to speak up, not silence the speakers. Most students rightly used it as a chance to educate others about the historical and cultural meanings of blackface, hosting town forums and posting hundreds of comments online. 
The takeaway for me was that wearing blackface is mor-
ally wrong, but students should be allowed to wear it. Chief Justice John Roberts explained this distinction eloquently as he announced the Court’s opinion in the Westboro case.
“Speech is powerful,” Roberts said. “It can stir people to 
action, move them to tears of both joy and sorrow, and...in-ﬂ  ict great pain...we cannot react to that pain by punishing the speaker. As a Nation we have chosen a different course...”

Following the Indiana Pacers’ Game 6 victory in the 
NBA Eastern Conference Finals on June 1, star cen-ter Roy Hibbert made comments that many people 
deemed offensive.
When asked about assisting teammate Paul George 
with guarding Miami Heat superstar LeBron James, ac-cording to Yahoo! Sports, Hibbert said, “I really felt that I let Paul down in terms of having his back when LeBron was scoring in the post or getting to the paint, because they stretched me out so much. No homo.” 
“No homo” is a slang expression used prominently in 
mainstream rap music and by young American males as a way of distancing themselves from words or actions that could be viewed as homosexual.
After he released what appears to be a sincere apology, 
Hibbert was ﬁ  ned $75,000 and is receiving harsh criticism from members of the media, league ofﬁ  cials and fans alike, according to Yahoo! Sports.  
While I cannot begin to understand how hurtful ho-
mophobic slurs can be to members of the gay community, I believe categorizing Hibbert as a homophobic villain is overkill. The comments were certainly in poor taste and as someone in the spotlight, Hibbert should have known that joking about such a sensitive topic would not be warmly received.
But to me, Hibbert’s “no homo” statement was nothing 
more than an off-color joke and clearly does not reﬂ  ect his genuine beliefs with regard to ho-mosexual lifestyle. Sure, he should have to accept the consequences, but there is simply no reason to villainize someone for making an off-the-cuff joke after winning the biggest game of his life.
Comparatively, in an interview 
with shock jock Artie Lange prior 
to Super Bowl XLVII in January, San Francisco 49ers cor-nerback Chris Culliver made comments drastically more malicious than Hibbert’s. According to Yahoo! Sports, Cul-liver said, “...we don’t got no gay people on the team, they gotta get up out of here if they do. Can’t be with that sweet stuff. Nah…can’t be…in the locker room man. Nah.” 
Despite what clearly reﬂ  ects genuine personal anti-gay 
beliefs, Culliver’s homophobic comments did not result in a ﬁ  ne. However, he did receive similar criticism to Hib-bert.
It is apparent that any time an athlete says something of 
poor taste, he is instantly classiﬁ  ed as a homophobe, racist or whatever his comments may have implied.
Certainly there should be backlash in instances where 
an athlete makes hateful and intolerant comments against a minority group — such as with Culliver — but I believe there needs to be discretion shown before society jumps down the throat of an athlete for his comments. I sincerely doubt, based on his buffoonery, anyone truly believes Hib-bert is a homophobe.
People give athletes too much credit. These guys are 
in the public eye for no reason other than superior physi-cal talents. Calling their dumb jokes “homophobic,” for example, implies that they were using their stardom to subtly express personal beliefs, which I believe is highly unlikely.
Some may argue that because professional athletes are 
often viewed as role models, they should behave as such. Well, I believe that people who view athletes as heroes need to change their perspective. The same way politicians are not elected based on their vertical leap or jump-shot accuracy, athletes’ words should not be analyzed with a ﬁ  ne-toothed comb.
Athletes’ line of work has them practicing their craft in 
a schoolyard-like atmosphere every day. This environment is one where joking and ridicule is a fact of life, and things are acceptably said on the ﬁ  eld, court or course that would be poorly received elsewhere.
Professional athletes are the last people we should be 
looking toward for professionalism. If you want someone to be mad at, blame the politicians who are unwilling to give homosexuals equal rights — not a guy getting paid to dunk a basketball who happened to make a bad joke.

UF Preview just got some P-Luv from 
the National Academic Advising Asso-
ciation.
The university’s orientation program 
was awarded with Outstanding Institu-tional Advising Program recognition in the 2013 National Advising Awards.
It was one of two winners within the 
category. The University of Minnesota was also awarded for its Center for Aca-demic Planning and Exploration. UF was awarded for Preview Orientation Advis-ing, according to the website. 
“The academic advising component 
of Preview is something that this ofﬁ  ce has worked very hard on improving over the years,” Joseph Spillane, director of UF’s Academic Advising Center, wrote in an email. “It is a real pleasure when all of that hard work is recognized on a national level.”
There are always new adaptations 
and components for Preview, and one reason it has been so successful is that the program constantly changes, he said. 
“The experience of working with Pre-
view is incredible and inspiring because of the connections we are able to make with students and families in a such a short time,” said Preview Staffer Joyner Atiles-Lopez, a 21-year-old recreation, parks and tourism senior. 
The Preview staff works as a team 
and motivates its members throughout the day, he said. 
“Preview was an amazing experi-
ence because it gave you a glimpse into what being a student at UF was going to be like,” said Angelica Marino, a 19-year-old UF public relations junior. “The staff was so friendly and energetic. You already felt as though you were a part of the Gator Nation.”8, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, JUNE 11, 2013

Matt Asbell and Adam Lobar are bringing 
zombies to Florida — and they’re going to at-
tack.
The two Gainesville residents are the own-
ers of the ﬁ  fth franchise of  Dystopia Rising, LLC.
Role-play enthusiasts from across the na-
tion will meet in July to play the live-action game set four generations after zombies take over the world, said 29-year-old Asbell. 
The duo began the process of buying the 
franchise in March. Asbell set up a monthlong fundraising campaign via the online Kick-starter platform in April, and it surpassed the goal. He had raised $2,250 by May 27, when the funding period ended.
When participants arrive at Camp Cho-
wenwaw Park in Green Cove Springs on July 19, they will establish their territory by plant-ing ﬂ  ags, Asbell said. Their mission will be to protect the camp and survive the weekend.
Participants will make up their own char-acters and costumes and establish their identi-ties, he said.
“People from all over the country will con-
verge so they can all play together,” Asbell said. “I know people from practically every major city in the country because of this game.”
In forming the franchise, Asbell and Lo-
bar were required to create a storyline for the Florida branch. Inspired by Gainesville, they named the game’s ﬁ  ctional location Gator-land.
“The biggest challenge is just creating the 
world for them, but really, that’s the fun part too,” said Lobar, a 30-year-old UF alumnus. 
One of Lobar’s character creations is a gam-
bling addict from Vegas named Seven Deuce Sal: Sal recently escaped slavery and is mak-ing his way to Gatorland. Sal’s story continues every Tuesday night, when a small group of locals meet to play the tabletop version of Dys-topia Rising.
Participants at Dystopia Rising events de-
velop social skills that might not be acquired in real life, Asbell said. Lobar said Dystopia Rising players develop separate relationships with people — personal relationships and character relationships.
“The great thing about LARP (live action 
role playing) is that you can get really pissed off at each other in character and then just go hang out after and have a beer,” he said.Zombies to come to Gatorland

MLB Draft
ADAM LICHTENSTEIN
Alligator Staff Writer
Karsten Whitson was the ninth 
overall selection in the 2010 MLB 
First-Year Player Draft. The right-hander out of Chipley turned down a $2.1 million offer from the San Diego Padres and instead went to Florida.
Three years and a shoulder sur-
gery later, Whitson was drafted again. This time, it was in the 37th round – 1,126th overall – by the Washington Nationals.
Whitson was one of two Gators 
picked by the Nationals on Satur-day, and one of four Florida play-ers who have seen playing time this year picked on the second and third days of the MLB Draft.
After the Detroit Tigers took 
junior pitcher Jonathon Crawford with the 20th overall pick in the first round on Thursday, UF had to wait 190 picks before another Gator was selected.
Left-handed reliever Daniel 
Gibson was second off the board, going 210th overall to the Arizona Diamondbacks on Friday. Gib-son was 2-1 with a 4.42 ERA in 32 games in 2013, including a disas-trous showing in his final appear-ance of the year.
In possibly his last appearance with the Gators, Gibson walked in the tying run and did not record an out in Florida’s 5-4 loss to Val-paraiso.
After Gibson was selected, no 
Florida player was drafted for an-other 10 rounds. 
Johnny Magliozzi was the third 
Gator selected, going to the New York Mets 506th overall. The Mets selected former Florida outfield-er Matt Den Dekker in 2010 and pitcher Alex Panteliodis in 2011. 
Magliozzi started four games 
for the Gators in 2013, but spent most of the season as Florida’s closer. He led the team with a 2.67 ERA and 12 saves.
Magliozzi pitched Florida’s last 
game of the year, going six innings and allowing four runs – three of which were earned. 
Second off the board on Day 
3 of the draft was infielder Cody Dent. The senior was selected by the Nationals 676th overall
Dent got the most playing time 
in his career in 2013, playing in 52 games and starting 48. He hit .169. 
Gibson, Magliozzi and Whitson 
all have college eligibility remain-ing. The deadline for them to agree to contracts with their MLB squads is July 15.

� WILBEKIN’S SUSPENSION 
IS HIS SECOND IN EIGHT MONTHS.
LANDON WATNICK
 Alligator Staff Writer
  
  Scottie Wilbekin’s career at Flori-
da has taken another misstep.
  Florida has suspended the ris-
ing senior point guard for violating 
team rules, the school announced Monday.
  UF did not release any further 
details. Under terms of suspension, Wilbekin will not be allowed to work out at the Florida basketball practice facility until he is reinstated.
  Wilbekin’s suspension is his sec-
ond in eight months. He was sus-pended on Nov. 8 for breaking team rules.
  The 6-foot-2 guard missed UF’s 
ﬁ  rst three games – including Flor-ida’s canceled matchup against Georgetown aboard the USS Bataan in Jacksonville on Nov. 9.
  “He starts fresh and clean in my 
mind,” coach Billy Donovan said af-ter Wilbekin’s ﬁ  rst suspension was lifted. 
  “Although we did address the 
things he has done, I think I’d be making the mistake as a coach to constantly keep holding onto that, because I’m expecting him to move on and expecting him to be com-mitted to himself, the team and the things he needs to do here.”
  After Florida began the season 
2-0, Wilbekin said the suspension was humbling.
  “It proves I’m not bigger than the 
team and no player is bigger than the team,” he said.
  Wilbekin had a breakout season 
as a junior in 2012-13, averaging 9.1 points on 45.3 percent shooting, ﬁ  ve assists and 2.9 rebounds in 31.9 min-utes per game as UF’s starting point guard. 
  Heralded as one of UF’s best 
on-ball defenders, he tallied a team-best 53 steals and was named to the Southeastern Conference’s All-De-fensive Team. 
  Wilbekin is one of two starters 
returning to a UF team that reached the Elite Eight for the third straight year. If his suspension continues into the 2013-14 regular season, Flor-ida’s depth at point guard would be tested.
  With Braxton Ogbueze trans-
ferring to UNC Charlotte, the only other natural point guard the Gators have on their roster is ﬁ  ve-star re-cruit Kasey Hill.

  Right-hander Tucker Simpson will 
transfer from Florida, a UF spokesman 
conﬁ  rmed Monday.
  The spokesman conﬁ  rmed Simpson 
will be transferring to a junior college. 
  Simpson created a Twitter handle 
on June 4. Members of the baseball pro-gram are prohibited from having a Twit-ter account unless if they signed profes-sionally or are no longer with the team, according to the UF spokesman. 
  At the same time players such as Jon-
athon Crawford were creating Twitter accounts upon going professional,   Simp-son posted on his account (@tsimp10): “FIRST EVER TWEET!! #excited #ﬁ  nal-lycanhavetwitter”
  Simpson will be eligible for the 2014 
MLB Draft. Per MLB rules, junior college players – regardless of how many years of school they have completed – are draft eligible. 
  During his freshman season in 2012-13, Simpson appeared in 13 games – starting eight on the mound – and rounded out his freshman season with a 1-2 record and 4.79 ERA. In 35.2 innings, he walked 15 batters and struck out 29.
  His ERA was last only to freshman 
Eric Hanhold’s 5.88.
  The 6-foot-6 Simp-
son was ranked as the 62nd-best right-handed pitcher in the nation, according to ESPN’s 2012 position rankings. Simpson played high school ball at Oxford High in Oxford, Ala., where he 
was ranked as the No. 1 right-hander and the No. 4 player in the state of Ala-bama in 2012.
  Simpson’s last appearance came 
against Georgia on May 17, where he pitched 1.1 frames and surrendered two walks after relieving freshman Parker Danciu in the bottom of the seventh.

AS STEIN ON TV
 Florida baseball is in trouble. For the 
second straight year, the MLB Draft has sucked the best talent away from 
Gainesville. 
  The season ended badly for the Gators, 
and 2014 is not off to the hottest start – 29-30 and a NCAA Regional appearance might not look so bad next June.
  Coming into 2013, everyone knew Florida 
would be in for a bumpy ride. The power hitters and dominant pitchers who took the Gators to three straight College World Series were all gone, leaving behind a young roster with few upperclassmen.
  Now, after a lackluster ﬁ  nal season, sev-
eral of those upperclassmen are gone. 
  Vickash Ramjit, one of the few consistent 
bats on a team starved for offense, leaves af-ter a senior season where he hit .277 with four homers – not good enough to draw the atten-tion of a major league squad.
  Cody Dent ﬁ  lled a spot in the lineup day 
in and day out, even if his .169 average didn’t do the trick.
  But the offense will be OK. Richie Martin, 
Harrison Bader, Casey Turgeon, Justin Shafer and Taylor Gushue will all be back.
  The real damage is to the pitching.  The offense struggled in 2013, but it was 
powerful compared to the pitching staff.  Jonathon Craw-
ford was the only consistent arm in the rotation. He’s gone. But don’t worry; he’ll be near-by. Crawford will likely be assigned to the Flying Tigers, 
Detroit’s Florida State League team – that’s only a little more than two hours from McK-ethan Stadium.
  Crawford struggled in 2013 and only 
won three games, but he started 15. No other pitcher started more than eight. But Detroit saw enough potential to snap him up 20th overall, higher than several experts had him going. That locks up his future – there is near-ly no chance Crawford ever returns to UF.
  All the other pitchers who rotated in and 
out of the bullpen had trouble – whether it be with injuries, command or just bad outings.
  Jay Carmichael looked solid in the rota-

tation next year.
  Sophomore right-hander Johnny Magliozzi was 
eligible for the draft due to a close-in-age rule, and the New York Mets picked him 506th overall. Whether that will be high enough to sway Magliozzi into pitch-ing minor league ball is unknown.
  The sophomore had the best season of any Gators 
pitcher, notching a 2.67 ERA in mostly bullpen ap-pearances. With another similar season or better – es-pecially if coach Kevin O’Sullivan moves him to the rotation permanently – Magliozzi could see his draft stock rise into the ﬁ  rst 10 rounds. 
  But a chance to get a deal done now and jump into 
the professional ranks might convince the UF closer. If it does, Florida will be in bad shape.
  But there is some potential help coming off the dis-
abled list.
  Juniors Karsten Whitson and Keenan Kish pitched 
a combined 5.1 innings in 2013. Kish did not get draft-ed. Whitson went 1,126th overall. 
  Whitson will likely come back to Florida for his ﬁ  -
nal year of eligibility to prove to pro teams that he still has gas in the tank. With his injury history, there’s no way he’ll pitch himself back into the top 10 picks, but he has the talent to get back into the ﬁ  rst 10 rounds. 
  If Whitson and Kish come back at full strength, the 
Gators will have a chance to compete again.
  If not, it could get ugly quickly at McKethan Sta-
dium. But I hear Lakeland’s Joker Marchant Stadium is nice.

during the NCAA outdoor championships in Eugene, Ore., on Saturday.
UF’s title ﬁ  fth 
in four years
men was the 110m hurdles. With a time of 13.32 
seconds, junior Eddie Lovett earned eight cru-cial points in a runner-up ﬁ  nish to Texas A&M’s Wayne Davis II. 
  Florida found itself down by nine points to 
No. 1 ranked Texas A&M with one event remain-ing – the men’s 4x400m relay. The only way the Gators would win a title would be if they won the 4x4 and the Aggies ﬁ  nished last in the event. 
  The cards were stacked against Florida, but 
the improbable happened.
  During the ﬁ  rst baton exchange, Texas A&M 
freshman Aldrich Bailey Jr. bobbled and dropped it during the handoff from senior Ricky Babi-neaux – all but ensuring a last-place ﬁ  nish for the Aggies.   
  “When I heard A&M dropped the stick, I was 
saying to myself, ‘Oh God, we got a good chance to win it,’” Graham said. 
  After two strong legs from Graham and Dukes, 
freshman anchor Arman Hall pulled away in the ﬁ  nal lap to secure Florida’s victory in the 4x4, as well as a share of the national title.
  “It felt great to bring it home for the win,” Hall 
said. “I knew Najee (Glass), Hugh and Dedric were going to put me out there in front, and all I would have to do is hold the lead and extend it if I had to.”
  Florida now has won ﬁ  ve national champion-
ships – two outdoors and three indoors – in four years.
  It was a dramatic title run for the Gators, 
whose bread-and-butter event is the men’s 4x400m relay. 
  “I’ve been asked for a few years now, ‘Why do 
you recruit so many quarter-milers?’” Holloway said. “People know why now.” TRACK , from page 1
