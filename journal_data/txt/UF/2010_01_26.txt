The Unite Party announced Sen-
ate President Ashton Charles as its
candidate for Student Body presi-
dent Monday afternoon.
Unite Party Spokesman Ben
Meyers introduced Charles to a
crowd of about 20 people on Turl-
ington Plaza at around 3 p.m.
After a brief statement announc-
ing her intention to run for the high-
est office in Student Government,
Charles said she will be interview-
ing candidates to fill the rest of the
executive ticket over the next week.
She said she'll be looking for one
quality while searching for her run-
ningmates.
"It's about having people that
genuinely care about this univer-
sity," she said.
Although the party is still final-
izing a platform, both Meyers and
Charles said there will be an em-phasis on transparency and com-
munication between SG and stu-
dents.
The Student Alliance Party, the
party resulting from the merging of
the Orange and Blue Party and the
Progress Party, announced former
Orange and Blue Party Sen. Ben Ca-
vataro as its candidate for Student
Body president on Wednesday.
"It's about having people
that genuinely care about
this university."

Magazine ranks Gainesville No. 11'gayest' US city
0:15 CITIES WERE RANKED ON THE LIST.

Forget San Francisco. Watch out, South Beach. Welcome to
Gainesville.
In the February issue of Advocate, a monthly gay news and
culture magazine, Gainesville was named the 11th gayest cityin the nation.
The 15 cities that made the list were ranked according to a
variety of factors, from same-sex couple households per capita
to gay dating profiles per single male popula-
Local tion.
News Gainesville scored an 11 out of 15 for gay
bars per capita, a shout-out to University Club
on East University Avenue.
Jim Spangler has been running University Club with his
son, Mark, for the past 20 years, providing locals with dragshows every Thursday through Saturday.
Spangler said he's seen other gay bars open and close and
credits University Club's success to its friendly atmosphere.
"[I think it's] the way we treat people, and our prices are
right," he said. "It's not just a gay bar -anybody's wel-
come."
Advocate also ranked cities based on number of gay elected
officials, for which Gainesville incorrectly received a zero.

Business school forum discusses curriculum changes
Danica Spears/ Alligator
Brian Ray, associate dean and director of UF's School of Business, talks to business students Monday in
Bryan Hall about the change in the school's curriculum.By REBECCA GREENWOOD
Alligator Contributing Writer
Students got down to business
Monday night in Bryan Hall to
discuss changes to the UF War-
rington College of Business Ad-
ministration's curriculum.
Brian Ray, the associate dean
and director of the School of
Business, said the changes will
include new course offerings to
make students more competitive
in the marketplace.
The changes will apply to in-
coming freshmen and will not
change coursework for current
business students.
"Both international business
and the global economy are top-
ics that are becoming increasing-
ly important for a well-rounded
business education," Ray said.
Beginning in fall 2010, all stu-
dents within the Warrington Col-
lege of Business Administration,
excluding economics majors, can
substitute international busi-
ness for managerial economics,
Ray said.
He said finance majors will no
longer need managerial econom-
ics as a prerequisite for higher-level finance courses.
Students had mixed feelings
about the changes to the manage-
rial economics requirement.
Those who have already taken
the course or are enrolled said the
change seemed unfair since it's
a difficult course. Enrolled stu-
dents also said the change came
at a bad time since the drop/add
period has passed.
However, students who have
not taken the course were pleased
with the change.
Shayna Held, a junior busi-
ness major, said
On she's excited aboutCampus taking international
business.
"I am a lot more interested in
that kind of class and think I will
get more out of it for real life,"
Held said.
The forum provided a chance
to welcome back the entrepre-
neurship and real estate minors,
which were suspended due to
budget cuts.
New courses in ethics, inter-
national entrepreneurship, sales
management, leadership and
venture finance have also been
added.
Chomp the Vote to hold talk about economic condition
0 FORUM WILL FEATURE
ECONOMICS PROFESSORS.
By HILARY SHEINBAUM
Alligator Contributing Writer
Chomp the Vote, a Student Government
agency dedicated to raising voter awareness,
is holding a forum tonight about the state of
the economy at 6 p.m. in Pugh Hall.
The event, which is beigh held about one
year after President Obama's inauguration,will focus on the president's economic policies
and how the U.S. economy has evolved.
"There has been so much attention paid
to President Obama's economic policy," said
Jenna Stem, Chomp the Vote director. "I know
there is a lot of confusion about how the deci-
sions made in Washington affect students here
at UF."
The discussion will also focus on America's
economic future.
Stem said Chomp the Vote wants to edu-
cate the student population about policy is-
sues that are important to our generation.
"Seniors who are graduating have to care"I know there is a lot of confusion
about how the decisions made in
Washington affect students here
at U F."
Jenna Stern
Chomp the Vote director
about the state of economic prosperity in this
country because we are all going to be out
there looking for jobs."
The forum will feature UF economics pro-
fessors David Denslow and Mark Rush.Event coordinators expect about 100 stu-
dents to attend.
Stem said Chomp the Vote members hope
to appeal to a student audience that may feel
disconnected from politics, by displaying vid-
eo clips of popular TV shows at the forum.
Katie Giglio, a UF communication sciences
and disorders junior, said the event will be
helpful as she pursues a career.
"I feel I need to be better informed about
our nation's economic status since I will soon
be entering the work force," Giglio said.
The event will be an hour long, and free
pizza will be served.

Tim Tebow Super Bowl ad draws differing opinions
By NICOLE LYNN GREINER
Alligator Contributing Writer
Former UF quarterback Tim
Tebow is Super Bowl-bound -
but he won't be on the field.
He will appear in a Super Bowl
commercial with his mother, Pam
Tebow.
The commercial, which will
run for 30 seconds, was created
by Focus on the Family, a non-
profit Christian organization.
The organization is not releas-ing any of the details of the ad-
vertisement until it airs.
"We want the ad to make an
impact, and the more details that
get out beforehand, the less the
impact will be," said Gary Sch-
neeberger, a spokesman for the
organization.
The ad was taped Jan. 4 in Or-
lando at Full Sail University, Sch-
neeberger said.
He said the location was cho-
sen for its technological resources
and its convenience for the Tebowfamily.
Schneeberger also said it was
unique for Focus
on the Family
to do a national
advertisement,
and that the
commercial was
funded through
Tebow donations.
"Tim and his
whole family are very outspo-
ken Christians, very committed
Christians," he said. "It will be, Ithink, a very meaningful and in-
spiring ad for people to see."
But some see the commercial
as wasteful spending.
"I do think that it is a shame
that Focus on the Family is spend-
ing millions of dollars when peo-
ple around the world and our
country need so much help," said
Staci Fox, president and CEO of
Planned Parenthood of North
Florida. "I think it is questionable
that they chose a Super Bowl ad
as their priority."Gregg Brekke, spokesman for
the United Church of Christ, also
questioned why CBS decided to
run the Focus on the Family ad.
Brekke said CBS did not run a
United Church of Christ ad five
years ago. He said he does not
think CBS accepts religious advo-
cacy ads.
But Shannon Jacobs, a spokes-
woman for CBS, wrote in an e-
mail that CBS ensures all ads are
appropriate for the air.

WITH DISABLED STUDENTS.

Alligator Contributing Writer
Staying committed to a workout can
be a challenge, but for some Gainesville
students, buddies are making it easier
and more fun.
Every Tuesday and Thursday, stu-
dents from the Sidney Lanier School, a
school for students with intellectual dis-
abilities, travel to the O'Connell Center
Weight Room to exercise with UF stu-
dents from noon to 2 p.m.
The goal is to have three volunteers
per Sidney Lanier student, said Melodie
Tamse, the program's director of opera-
tions.
"We don't want them standing around
doing nothing," Tamse said. "We want
them active the whole time."
Volunteers are assigned to specific
students, age 17 to 22, based on their
personality types to help everyone enjoy
their time together.
This semester, seven more Sidney La-
nier students are in the program, which
requires about 20 more volunteers. Last
semester, about 30 volunteers teamed upwith 13 students.
Tony Delisle, a research director for
the program, said the Sidney Lanier stu-
dents love the attention from the volun-
teers and feel like they have their own
personal entourage. Delisle assesses the
students' progress in physical fitness and
the psychological, emotional and social
aspects the program has on the partici-
pants.
Sidney Lanier students involved in
the program tend to be more active, inde-
pendent and improve their
On social skills, Delisle said. HeCampus added the same is true for
the volunteers.
Rebecca Danta, a UF freshman, is a
new volunteer this semester and thinks
the experience is going to be hard but re-
warding.
Although she was initially anxious to
work with students with intellectual dis-
abilities, Danta said it's a good cause and
an important issue.
"There's a stigma about being mental-
ly disabled," Danta said. "A lot of times
they've been rejected. I want to show
them that I can be a safe haven to them
and that I can show love to them."
Students who wish to volunteer

TAKING THE SURVEY.
By MELINDA CARSTENSEN
Alligator Contributing Writer
The Alachua County Coalition for the
Homeless and Hungry is searching soup
kitchens, social service sites, woods and
alleyways this week in an effort to gather
information on the number of homeless
people in North Central Florida.
Beginning today in Alachua County,
advocates and those who are homeless
will band together to gather data on demo-
graphics, unmet social service needs and
causes and lengths of homelessness.
The survey has been conducted in Ala-
chua County within the last 10 days of Jan-
uary every year since 2003.
"It's the one time of year that we're
able to count on the data to be comparable
to years past, so it lets us know about the
changes that have occurred in the area,"
the coalition's executive director Jon De-
The Olam Cafe is empty.
After losing $20,000 on dining opera-
tions last year, the cafe is becoming sole-
ly an online ordering system, said Avie
Friederwitzer, owner of All Star Cater-
ers and The Olam Caf6 at UF Hillel.
"It'll help me because I won't be
over-preparing," Friederwitzer said. "I
won't be cooking for 20 when I have six
orders."
The new online system, which will
be integrated into The Olam Caf6s Web
site this week, will release weekly menu
options every Sunday, and custom-
ers can place orders for the day or the
week.
The menu items will consist of an en-
tree, two sides, soup, salad, a drink and
dessert.
The system will require customers
to order lunch by 9 a.m. and dinner by
3 p.m. each day. Lunch is served from
noon to 2 p.m., and dinner is served
from 6 to 8 p.m.Carmine said.
DeCarmine said homeless people will
be paid a living wage to contribute to the
survey.
"Homeless people are their own best ad-
vocates and the best way [for us] to deter-
mine what our programs need is by asking
those people," DeCarmine said.
The first survey was conducted in 2003.
Since then, the number of homeless
men, women and children counted in
Alachua County has increased from 852
to more than 1,600, according to the press
release.
This is the first year the coalition will
conduct a census in Bradford, Levy, Put-
nam and Gilchrist counties.
Each census is conducted within a 24-
hour period so that those gathering infor-
mation do not double-count anyone, De-
Carmine said.
According to a press release, the coali-
tion will release initial results of this year's
count by Friday.
A detailed report of homeless conditions
will follow in March.
"We're trying to get everyone
to order online. However, we
understand that there will be
people who can't, and I know
that we'll do our best to ac-
commodate them."
Avie Friederwitzer
owner of All Star Caterers and The
Olam Caf6
After ordering online, customers can
pick up their orders within those times.
Some complain that the lunchtime
deadline could be inconvenient, but
Friederwitzer stresses the flexibility of
the online system.
"We're trying to get everyone to or-
der online," he said. "However, we un-
derstand that there will be people who
can't, and I know that we'll do our best
to accommodate them."

Cold causes something fishy to go on in Lake Alice
By JOEY FLECHAS
Alligator Writer
After the recent cold snap,
even fish have been caught dead
in the water.
UF graduate student Sushmit
Shreyans noticed more than 20
fish floating near the surface of
Lake Alice when he biked past it
on Saturday.
When he jogged by the lake
Sunday night, he noticed a foul
odor coming from the water.
"I could smell it, and it was
smelling really bad," Shreyans
said.
George Burgess, director for
the Florida Program for Shark
Research at the Florida Museum
of Natural History, has not seen
the fish.
However, he suspects most
of them are probably non-native
blue tilapia affected by the cold
snap earlier this month.
He cited the blue tilapia's in-
tolerance for cold temperaturesA fish lies dead Monday afternoon on the shoreline of Lake Alice.as the reason they probably be-

Low temperatures send GRU bills through the roof
By ROXANNE FRASER
Alligator Contributing Writer
With recent temperatures hitting record
lows, locals may encounter highs in their
electric bills from Gainesville Regional Util-
ities this month."Anytime you run your heater or air con-
ditioner constantly, you need to be aware
that your bill will be higher," said Alex
Wise, a GRU intern.
GRU broke two records for peak demand
of electricity, Wise said.
Between Jan. 1 and Jan. 13, there were
nine nights that the temperature was belowfreezing.
GRU advises people to keep the heater
on 68 degrees Fahrenheit,
Local Wise said.
News "It can make a big differ-
ence because a lot of your elec-
tricity bill comes from heating and cooling
cost," Wise said.For those who have trouble paying, GRU
has plans in place to help.
Project Share, a payment program, pro-
vides one-time assistance in which people
can donate or request help. Help is allotted
on a case-by-case basis.

Reality Check
BET shouldn't reward
Michael Vick
week from today, "The Michael Vick Project" will air on
Black Entertainment Television, and the Editorial Board
would like to make it clear that we won't be watching -
and we hope the Student Body won't either.
Vick spent almost two years in federal prison for fighting pit
bulls. In case you forgot, he hung them from clotheslines and
electrocuted them when they were no longer good at annihilat-
ing each other.
Since his release, Vick has been coddled and drooled over.
The Philadelphia Eagles took him in a few weeks into the 2009
season -no accountability there.
In December, his team awarded him the Ed Block Courage
Award, which is supposed to reward a player who shows "com-
mitment to the principles of sportsmanship and courage." Sure,
Vick, if you equate courage with beating animals until they're
so terrified and angry that they rip each other's flesh.
Now BET is giving Vick a chance to beg for sympathy and
portray himself as someone who deserves forgiveness.
According to a story on Change.org, Vick says on the show
that dog fighting "excited him" and he "gravitated to it." Well,
Vick, that might be a defense for an addiction to horror movies
or porn, but it's not a good excuse for the torture and murder
of living things. Not only is BET giving him a forum to try to
sway us into thinking he's human, but also, because we're sure
he's not doing it for free, they're rewarding him for his horrific
behavior.
Americans shouldn't give him the satisfaction of listening to
his story. We should make it clear that we think he's a monster
and deserves the same treatment he inflicted on his dogs.
Until BET changes the title of the show to "The Michael Dick
Project," we'll be sticking to MTV on Tuesday nights.
Presidential Preview
On Wednesday, Presi-dent Obama will
be broadcasted into
American living rooms to
tell us about the shape our
country is in. But you don't
have to wait until then to
hear his talking points. We
are going to cut the crap and
get to the truth. The State of
the Union is perilous.
The first thing to tackle is
the economy, which still has
not rebounded from its col-
lapse. The national unem-
ployment rate is still hover-
ing around 10 percent, which
doesn't bode well for soon-to-
be college graduates. Good
thing the print journalism in-
dustry is in such good shape
that we at the Alligator don't
have to stress about getting
hired when we leave UF 
-
not.
The other big item on the
national political landscape
is health care reform. Political
games can be fun. We wouldnormallybe on the edge of our
seats with the popcorn ready
at the prospect of a thrilling
filibuster -a thrillabuster,
if you will. But when we're
dealing with health care,
we're talking about people's
lives hanging in the balance.
We think health care is a basic
human right, and you're wel-
come to disagree. But we'll let
you be the one to tell someone
they can't have a life-saving
procedure because they don't
have the funds.
And now the one thing that
could always make us feel bet-
ter about ourselves -no mat-
ter how stressful our day -is
gone. We could always count
on turning on "Jersey Shore"
to remind us that, hey, at least
we're better than somebody.
We need the president and
Congress to recognize how to
make our country better, so
we can get our superiority fix
from living in the best country
in the world, not from trashy
reality TV.

Conan offered comi
onan O'Brien's final episode as the host of "The
Tonight Show" aired last Friday, and damn it, I'm
feeling a little sad over it.
I know -pop culture isn't really my beat. And I know
it's foolish to get too emotional over the career troubles of a
well-regarded talk show host who made more money in the
seven months he hosted "The Tonight Show" than I likely
will in a lifetime.
Conan himself made it clear in his Jan. 12 statement reject-
ing NBC's plan to push his show to 12:05 a.m. that "no one
should waste a second feeling sorry" for him, especially "in a
world with real problems."
There is no shortage of natural and man-made disasters
in this world, and even for someone who self-identifies as
a big fan of Conan, some perspective is needed. Conan's re-
ported $33 million severance package, for instance, is more
than 25,000 times the per capita gross domestic product of
Haiti -tears for Conan are clearly unnecessary. Time and
emotional energy, as Conan repeatedly averred in his last
several shows, are more urgently needed elsewhere.
Besides, it's silly to assign too much meaning to a TV
show that exists primarily as a vehicle for celebrities to shill
their latest movies.I'm cognizant of all this. But I'd be lying if
I said I was unaffected by Conan's swan song.
I am, admittedly, one of the fans who didn't watch his
show religiously. But I can say that it was always comforting
to know that whenever I was having a bad day, a hilarious
redheaded man would be on the TV, bouncing around the
screen like a caffeinated giraffe and doing comedy that was
sometimes brilliant, occasionally endearingly dumb and al-
most always surreal and creative.
In fact, I remember a Valentine's Day a couple of years
ago when I was bemoaning the fact that my plans that eve-
ning consisted of laundry, ice cream and Conan. One of my
best friends, who goes to school in Virginia, wrote me a card
that said, "When I'm snuggling up with a pint of ChunkyALL
NE7W
61
sorting consistency
Monkey and waiting for Conan to
come on, know I wish I was snuggling
with you."
Yeah, I remember frustratedly
wishing that about her, too. But Co-
nan was a good enough plan B.
Joe Dellosa And it's not just frustration over
letters@a ligator org the fact that my bad-day fixer has
been taken off the airwaves. I started
watching Conan during my sopho-
more year of high school, and I remember how excited my
friends and I were that Conan would be getting "The Tonight
Show" in 2009. He'd be starting the show as we were finish-
ing up college, and I took some comfort in knowing that as I
was supposed to be growing up, at least Conan will still be
blithely making a delightful ass out of himself.
And surprisingly enough, his words have proved to be a
source of (at times, much-needed) inspiration for me. When
Conan addressed the graduating class at Harvard in 2000,
he spoke of the importance of taking chances and getting up
from failure, urging graduates to "fall down, make a mess,
break something occasionally and remember that the story
is never over."
When Conan addressed the graduating class at New
York's Stuyvesant High School in 2006, he told the college-
bound graduates to "take a moment every now and then to
breathe, look around you," and to avoid rigidly following a
set of plans at the expense of exploring and experimenting.
This really shouldn't sound too eulogistic. Conan will
likely wind up back on TV once his no-compete clause ex-
pires (right, Fox?), and even if he doesn't, the world will,
indeed, go on. But in an industry that seems to favor homog-
enization, I think it's worth taking note of a genuinely unique
guy who seems more than a little decent as well.
Good luck, Coco! I'm with you.

Guest column
Dove church, health bill parallel
eligion can be fairly divided into two parts:what you believer and how you tell other
people what you believe.
Sometimes people can pitch really well a belief
system that's actually ridiculous -that's called a
"cult." And sometimes you can convince all your
friends to join you in something that's actually
desirable -it's probably an iPhone.
But then there's the other half, when you have
a horrible ability to tell people what you believe.
Maybe the content is crazy, too, and then the idea
usually dies out.
But sometimes the beliefs are well-established,
and it's just the presentation that turns people off
-like health care.
Well, I went to the Dove World Outreach Cen-
ter this Sunday, and I think it's in the same camp
as the health care bill.
See, what the center believes is actually almost
orthodox Christianity: God loves you, but ev-
eryone is a sinner; and it's only if you believe in
Christ's saving power that you can go to heaven.
That's what Christianity is, and it's working pret-
ty well for a lot of people.
So it's not really the message that's any dif-
ferent from any other Christian group. It's the
center's presentation. And I admit, seeing "Islam
is of the Devil" signs doesn't make me want to
drink their Kool-Aid. (Literally: They have lunch
after the service, and we declined to stay.)
But, as has been reported in the Alligator be-
fore, all the sign really means to them is that Is-
lam (along with all other religions) is untrue and
divergent from the "correct" way to heaven.
Yep, that's basically what Christians believe.
Most of them just don't wear shirts to school ad-
vertising it, because that's an insensitive way to
bring up a sensitive topic.
This kind of PR disaster is pretty close to how
things are going with the health care bill. ThisWill Pennman whole "health care as a
SpeakingOut right" thing is a pretty good
idea, people say, but no one
can figure out how to con-
vey that.
It's going to cost some people more money,
you know. Ouch. And it's going to mandate peo-
ple to have health insurance.
Eh, I'm not such a fan. And somehow, all those
unsavory aspects have bogged down the entire
venture, and no one knows if it's even going to
happen at all.
I know, the Dove World Outreach Center and
the health care debate have probably not been
considered parallels by many people. And there
are differences. But we shouldn't hate on the
Dove World Outreach Center because it needs
better marketing.
The center's members are actually pretty nice
people. They're a little frumpy, and the kids
seem overly enthusiastic -and the tilted cross is
weird. But they're pretty nice, pretty biblical peo-
ple other than their interpersonal philosophy.
My favorite part is that they can take a joke. It
turns out that most of them grew up in Germany.
(We speculated that perhaps that's the reason for
the focus on Islam -it's a big deal over there.)
Well, it just happens that my roommate and I are
learning German.
So I asked them after the service in German if
they all came from Germany. "Yeah, most of us,"
one woman said back in German. "Why are you
studying it?"
"Oh, well, we think Germany is of the devil,"
I said casually. My friends tensed up waiting for
a stern rebuke.
But they laughed. "Probably," they said. Inof-
fensive? Not quite. But in that, I had new hope for
the health care bill.

that's what leads to the robberies, the
burglaries -when they can't eat," he
said.
Former Mayor Mark Goldstein said
that while he has spent his life caring
for his inner city neighborhood, Gaines-
ville's homeless frequently trespass on
campus.
"I consider them transients, parolees
and convicts," Goldstein said.
John Stokes, a local attorney, said he
believed the limit on religious assem-
blies violates the First Amendment right
to freedom of religion.
However, Stephanie Marchman of the
city attorney's office said federal courts
have upheld local governments' right to
regulate homeless shelters.
Current law also restricts food distri-
bution from religious assemblies within
2,000 feet of the UF campus.
The rule prevents many of the church-es and synagogues popular among stu-
dents from serving food to the home-
less.
The committee recommended restrict-
ing religious assemblies within residen-

rolees and convicts."

tial zones to its current limit of 20 meals
a day but making an exception between
11 a.m. and 2 p.m., during which times
they would be allowed to serve unlim-
ited food.
Currently, there is no limit on food
served to-go.
If the city does change its regulations,
Alachua County law still will limit reli-
gious assemblies to serving 25 meals a
day, according to City Planning Man-
ager Ralph Hilliard.
Pastor: Ranking shows depravity
Sweet Relief
UF senior Caroline Miazgowicz receives a dark chocolate hempseed truffle
for her $5 donation to enVeg, which held a vegan bake sale Monday to raise
money for the United Nations Children's Fund. All proceeds made at the
bake sale will be used to provide food, clean water, shelter and medical sup-
plies for disaster victims in Haiti.ARTICLE, from page 1
didate, is open about his sexual orientation.
Though he understands the light nature
of the article, he said the ranking by a na-
tional publication is positive attention for
the city.
"What's important is that Gainesville is
a fair community," he said. "In these times
we can't afford to discard any talent or intel-
lect .We do want to be able to maximize
the human resources that we have here .
to give them the opportunity to contribute
to Gainesville's future."
But not everyone was excited about the
town's new fame.
"The fact that Gainesville was rated the
11th gayest city in the nation shows the de-
pravity of our nation and the weakness of
the church," said Terry Jones, senior pastor
of the Dove World Outreach Center. "We
must, as a nation and a church, repent for
such acts of sin against our community .
and return to the true gospel of truth, love
and repentance."
But Pride Community Center of North
Central Florida Co-President Terry Flemingis proud of the ranking.
"Gainesville is a remarkable community
that recognizes the importance of diver-
sity," Fleming said.
"And it's gratifying to see that others are
recognizing what a great place [it] is to live
[in]."
UF senior and Pride Student Union Vice
President of Outreach
Whitney Blake said she
was "incredibly surprised
but happily so" to hear of
the ranking.
Originally from South
Florida, Blake said part
of the reason she choseLowe to attend UF was for it's
progressiveness and strong LGBT repre-
sentation.
"It's like a progressive little pocket in
North Central Florida," she said. "I think
Gainesville is very friendly."
The top ten cities in order were Atlanta;
Burlington, Vt.; Iowa City; Bloomington,
Ind.; Madison, Wis.; New Orleans; Fort
Lauderdale; Portland, Maine; Austin, Tex-
as; and Seattle.

Stats shown are from UFs games
against Arkansas and South Carolina
After struggling to find his outside shot
early in the year, Walker has been nothing
short of on fire lately. He single-handedly
kept the Gators alive long enough for
them to get out of Fayetteville, Ark., with a
71-66 win. Walker was perfect in the first
Erving Walker half, scoring 15 points on 4-of-4 shooting
from the field and draining three shots from
beyond the arc. He finished with a career-high 27 points on
7-of-1 2 shooting against the Razorbacks and followed that up
with a 1 3-point, seven-assist, five-rebound performance against
the Gamecocks. The 5-foot-8 point guard is shooting 61.3
percent from three-point range in SEC play, and he hasn't shown
signs of slowing down anytime soon.
Stats: 40 pts, 11 -of-21 FGs, 8-of-1 0 threes, 11 assistsThe Gators have struggled
to stay competitive on the glass
all season, but Tyus has done
his part lately to help pick up
the slack. The junior power
forward pulled down 12 boards
while adding 11 points against
Alex Tyus Arkansas, and he nearly posted
back-to-back double-doubles
with his 1 2-point, nine-rebound outing against South
Carolina. Tyus has grown more comfortable at the
power forward spot as the year has gone on, and
he has averaged 14.1 points and 7.9 rebounds over
the last 10 games, scoring in double-figures in all of
those contests and 15-plus in five of them.
Stats: 23 pts, 9-of-21 FGs, 21 rebounds

Parsons didn't exactly light it up this
week, and in fact, he's the only player on
this list who scored under his season aver-
age (10.7 points) in both games. But he hit
the most important shot of the week, drilling
a three-pointer at the buzzer to hand the
Gators a win over the Gamecocks. That,
Chandler Parsons coupled with back-to-back games with
double-digit rebounds was enough for him
to claim third place. He started the last three games for an
under-the-weather Dan Werner but has snatched that spot for
himself thanks to consistent play. He logged a team-high 36
minutes against USC, and you can expect to see him on the
court a lot throughout the rest of the season.
Stats: 16 pts, 5-of-18 FGs, 21 rebounds

UF MEN'S BASKETBALL
Late-game heroics
bring Parsons fame
By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
aberry@alligator org
After his teammates dogpiled
on him following his buzzer-beat-
ing three-pointer Saturday, Chan-
dler Parsons found himself buried
beneath a load of Facebook friend
requests.
The response to the junior for-
ward's second game-winner of the
year against South Carolina was
overwhelming -to the point that
it put him at Facebook's friend
limit of 5,000.
Hitting game-winning threes
has become something of a regular
occurrence for Parsons this month,
as his shot from beyond the arc
Saturday brought back memories
of his 75-foot desperation heave
against N.C. State on Jan. 3.
Parsons isn't letting the spot-
light get to his head, though.
"It feels good," Parsons said.
"To make those shots, to get the
win for my team is really impor-
tant to me. The recognition, the
fame and stuff -that's great, but
the win to me is bigger."
UF coach Billy Donovan has
stressed to Parsons the importance
of putting his recent success in per-
spective, reminding him how frag-ile it can be. The real test, Donovan
said, is whether Parsons maintains
his current level of confidence no
matter how he performs.
"I told him that when you
make a game-winning shot like
that, you're not as great as ev-
eryone thinks you are," Donovan
said. "And when you miss a shot,
you're not as bad as everyone
thinks you are."
Based on his comments to the
media Monday, Parsons is taking
his coach's advice to heart.
Parsons detailed the series of
events that led to his shot, noting
the importance of each one: South
Carolina guard Devan Downey
falling to the court after his im-
probable coast-to-coast layup,
Dan Werner quickly getting the
inbounds pass to Erving Walker
and the point guard's unselfish
pass to his wide-open teammate.
And, as Donovan told him,
Parsons has realized just how dif-
ferent things would be if the shot
hadn't fallen.
"It's crazy how if that ball
rattles out, the whole role is re-
versed," Parsons said. "Some peo-
ple might even call me a choke if
that ball doesn't go in. No game is
won by one shot. It came at a good
time, but we won the game play-Harrison Diamond/ Alligator Staff
UF forward Chandler Parsons is mobbed by his teammates after his game-winning three-pointer at the
buzzer of the Gators' 58-56 win against South Carolina in the O'Connell Center on Saturday night.
ing defense, rebounding, doing all
the little things."
Parsons is averaging 10.7 points
and 6.6 rebounds per game on the
season and has stepped up his ef-
forts on the glass during South-
eastern Conference play, pulling
down 7.6 boards per game, tied
for the team high with power for-
ward Alex Tyus.
"He's just been phenomenal
defensively, getting rebounds,
scoring, clutch shots," Walkersaid. "We can't ask for much more
from him right now."
In addition to making two
buzzer-beaters -something no
Florida player has ever done in his
career -in just one month, Par-
sons' once-temporary move into
the Gators' starting lineup has
been made permanent.
The 6-foot-9 swingman was
already playing 27.9 minutes per
game and on the court during crit-
ical late-game situations, but he isnow projected to make his fourth-
straight start against Georgia on
Wednesday.
"Coach has always told me that
whenever I came into the game,
that's when I started," Parsons
said. "It just so happens that I ac-
tually come in with no time ran off
yet.
"It doesn't really matter to me.
Either way, I'm going to play with
passion and energy."
Want to impress at Southwest? Follow these simple instructions
I t's springtime and I finally replaced my old grip-less basketball shoes, so I
plan on spending much of the next few
months on the court playing pickup games
at Southwest.
I'm about to share everything I've
learned over the previous three or so years
about how to gain respect at UF's biggest
rec center.
Follow these 10 simple instructions and
you're sure to become a pickup game leg-
end.
Wear a jersey: What's the best way to
play like Kobe, LeBron or D-Wade? Come
to the gym wearing one of their jerseys, of
course. Don't want to spend $50 on a jer-
sey that will have to be put through the
wash and eventually ruined? Dust off that
old high school uniform which is sure togive you instant credibility if you're trying
to convince the guy who has downs that
you're good enough to run with him.
Insist on playing to 11 by ones: When
the NBA adopted the three-point line in
1979-80, it made a huge mistake. Forget all
the spacing that the threat of a three-point
line creates, Southwest has it right. Basket-
ball was suppose to be ruled by the biggest
and baddest dudes. Who likes a game with
ball movement and deep shooting? I'd
much rather play a game in which who-
ever is taller and can outmuscle the other
team is guaranteed to win. Don't you dare
try suggesting playing to 15 with ones and
twos. We all know that takes much, much
longer to finish, and as I've heard numer-
ous times at Southwest, "That's not how
we play out here."H
Kyle Maistri
Kyle Points
kmaistri@alligator orgNo twos? No
problem: Sure, that
25-footer counts just
the same as a layup,
but don't let that stop
you from jacking it
up with a defender
in your face. Anyone
can knife through the
lane and finish at the
rim with either hand, but only a select few
can stand behind the now-meaningless
three-point line and hoist shot after shot.
Missed a few bombs in a row? That never
deters Kenny Boynton, and it certainly
shouldn't deter you. No one is more fun
to play with than the guy who takes any
opportunity to launch a shot from down-
town in an all-ones game.Talk Trash: Let that freshman know
who's the man after you jumped over his
back, caught him with an elbow and laid
the ball in on your third try from three feet
away. Not everyone has the physical skills
to be the best player on the court, but al-
most everyone has the ability to talk like
the best player on the court, which is al-
most as respectable. If you really want to
let people know you're not playing around,
make sure to talk trash to your teammate
who let one of your no-look passes slam
off his hands and out of bounds. Start do-
ing that in your Kobe jersey and someone
might actually confuse you for the real
Kobe.
Harass anyone who calls a foul on
you: This isn't the O'Dome. No blood, no

foul. After knocking the opposition to the
ground on a fast break, make sure to tell
your opponent what a bitch he is as he's
checking it up from the top of the key. I
don't see any officials on the court, which
means anyone who calls a foul is just plain
soft.
Prove how much of a man you are:
Back up your sharp criticism of the other
team by showing how a real man conducts
himself on the hardwood. After getting
mauled on that putback attempt, don't
say anything as the other team looks to
you and asks in unison, "Did you call it?"
Then start whining to your defender about
how he needs to be careful because he al-
most ripped off your head. Make sure to
whine through the next five or six points,
and only stop when someone gives you
this ultimatum, "Call your fouls, or shut
the hell up."
Call everything: Sure, you just spent
the last 10 minutes lecturing on the "street"
code of foul calls, but that doesn't mean
you shouldn't barrel into the lane like Le-
Bron, create contact like A.I. and cry about
getting hacked like Anderson Varejao. The
only way all the other scrubs on the court
can possibly stop you is to give up any
hope of a clean defensive play and hang
all over you on your way to the basket.
Even though you just told everyone how
you don't call fouls because "it's real out
here," you can't let them take you out ofyour game.
Settle disputes with integrity: Just
because that errant pass clearly brushed
your hand before sailing out of bounds
doesn't mean the other team can prove
it. There's no instant replay at the rec, so
act as incredulous as possible when that
scrub says it's out on you. It's not about
who's right and who's wrong, only who's
willing to yell and scream the loudest and
longest. Make sure that person is you.
Don't ever switch: The kid you let run
with you and your group of friends sucks,
and he's getting abused by a player on the
other team. Keep complaining about how
your teammate plays no defense and make
him feel even worse after he failed to fight
through a screen that you neglected to call
out. But whatever you do, DO NOT offer
a switch. The last thing you want is that
same baller on the other squad punking
you, too.
Talk the talk: Like anything else, bas-
ketball has a vernacular. Don't let lack of
skill or being white keep you from em-
bracing that. Whenever you sink a jump-
er, let everyone know that shot was "wet,"
even if it slammed off the backboard un-
intentionally. Waiting for downs because
you couldn't get picked up on the previ-
ous game? Stand with one foot in play on
the side of the court and annoyingly ask
whoever is handling the ball, "What's the
count?" And after you get your ass kicked
make sure to say "run it back" as quickly
as possible because there's no way you
can lose twice in a row.
