SPORTS 36Bill would OK ‘Neh-VAH-da’ pronunciation
The misuse of one little vowel frustrates a lot of Nevadans 
who get irritated by the mispronunciation of the state’s name — 
using an “ah” instead of “a.”
Outgoing Assemblyman Harry Mortenson is proposing 
more tolerance. The Las Vegas Democrat is working on a resolu-tion for the 2011 legislative session to make the “Ne-VAH-da” pronunciation equally acceptable to the one with the short “a.”
Mortenson says he’s not asking Nevadans to change. He just 
wants the Spanish pronunciation recognized.

Students leave the newly renovated Southwest Recreation Center Sunday night.
� THE NEW FACILITY HAS AN INDOOR TRACK.
By ANDREW PANTAZI
Alligator Writer
After one year and $16.3 million of construction and 
rennovation, Southwest Recreation Center reopened 
its doors last Wednesday.
Students seeking a fitness fix are enjoying the newly 
renovated center, which has been under construction 
since Aug. 25.
The center was expanded by 40,000 square feet, and 
much of the pre-existing space was also renovated, ac-cording to the UF RecSports website.
And while gym-goers are enjoying the renovations, 
there are other areas that some students would still 
like to see changed.
Justin McKenzie, a telecommunications senior, said 
he likes the new indoor track but said he would like to 
see additions made to the racquetball courts.
Ryan Chilton, an engineering graduate student, 
said he wishes the center had expanded the weight room in addition to the cardio room. 
He also disagreed with RecSports’ decision to add 
an indoor track.
“We live in Florida,” he said. “You don’t have to Renovated rec

UF fell in the US News & World 
Report’s Best Colleges Rankings 
this year. 
In last year’s rankings, UF held 
the No. 47 spot. This year, UF fell 
to No. 53, making it the second-ranked university in the state. 
The new top school in the state 
is the University of Miami, which claimed Florida’s old spot at No. 47.
UF’s president Bernie Machen 
didn’t seem too worried about the drop in rank. 
“I don’t think we’re down and 
out,” he said of the rankings that 
came out Aug. 17. “I think if you 
look at what has happened, it’s mainly about resources.”And when he’s talking about 
resources, he’s talking about bud-get. The recession has forced UF to make some hefty budget cuts.
For example, about $7.7 million 
was cut from the Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences in 2009. About another $3 million was cut from the UF College of Engineering that same year.
Machen said UM and other pri-
vate schools that rose in rank this year “have had a better handle on UF drops in ranking

Santa Fe College traffic tips
Santa Fe College is expecting 
a record number of students 
for the Fall 2010-2011 semes-
ter. Due to construction at the Northwest campus, there are fewer parking spaces than normal. College officials ask 
that students use the cam-
pus entrances off of NW 83rd Street. Use NW 91st Street to access the North Parking 
Lot and overflow parking. 
The overflow lot is the only place on campus where stu-dents may park in the grass. Students should also not park 
in the reserved (blue) spaces for faculty and staff or risk 
receiving a parking citation. Students who need assis-tance are encouraged to visit one of the seven welcome 
stations set up across cam-
pus, equipped with maps, information, and laptops to access schedules.

PUBLIC HEALTH
By KAT BEIN
Alligator Staff Writer
A recently enacted tanning tax is getting 
on Gators’ nerves, but the “orange” in Orange 
and Blue isn’t going anywhere.
As part of the health care reform law signed 
by President Barack Obama in March, all tan-
ning services that use ultraviolet lamps with 
wavelengths between 200 and 400 nanometers are taxed an additional 10 percent by the IRS, according to Alligator archives, and the mon-ey is used to fund the new health system.
Chris Geisenburg, who owns Tan USA on 
Northwest 39th Avenue with his wife, said the tax hasn’t turned  his customers away, but they do gripe about it.
“No one likes it,” he said, “and they really 
don’t like it when they find out they’ve got to pay for that health care.”
Geisenburg said he doesn’t believe the new 
tax is fair to his mostly female customers.
“More women are paying this tan tax than 
anyone else,” he said. “It’s really a discrimina-tory tax.”
Gainesville resident Sandy Mihocik, a lab 
tech for the Florida Department of Transpor-tation said she continues to visit Tan USA at least four times a week. As far as the tax is con-cerned, she said, she’s pretty much “sucked it up and dealt with it,” although she said it’s “completely unfair.”“They’re just targeting an industry with no 
lobbyists,” Mihocik said. “My boyfriend tans also in Orlando … he feels the same way I do. It’s ridiculous.”
Mihocik, who said she prefers tanning beds 
to lying out in the sun because she can control the amount of light and time it takes to tan, doesn’t agree with the argument that the tax 
helps deter people from what is considered a 
more harmful tanning solution.
“If you’re going to get skin cancer, you’re 
going to get it,” she said. “Why not tax people who sell tan lotion?”
Many students have found a way around 
the tax because they live in apartment com-plexes that come with free tanning services.
Carly Myers, a 19-year-old political science 
major at Santa Fe College, said she uses her free tanning at Campus Lodge about once a week — but only because it’s free.
“It’s more of a convenient thing,” she said. 
“But it’s not really worth the money to me.” Gators get glow on despite 10-percent tanning tax
� THE EPISODE WILL AIR ON 
SEPT. 15.

On July 27, Kevin Knudson, 
the UF Honors Program director, 
wasn’t searching for answers. 
He was giving questions.
Knudson, 40, has watched 
Jeopardy! since it first started in its modern form with host Alex 
Trebek in 1984. But on Sept. 15, he 
will watch himself as a competi-tor.
Because he is under contract with the show, Knudson cannot comment about how he did or 
what categories were offered dur-
ing the show’s filming last month, but he did say one of the questions he got right was “Who is Justin Bieber?”
“My wife’s big on pop culture, 
so I picked that up by osmosis,” he said. 
Knudson has a doctorate in 
mathematics, and this fall he is teaching a one-credit honors course on origami and math.
This was the second time Knud-
son applied to be on the show. He 
applied in college for the Jeopar-
dy! College Championship, but he didn’t make it.
This time, he took a 50-ques-
tion online test and a written test before he played a mock version of the game in Miami.
“The whole thing lasts a couple 
of hours, and you 
don’t know any-
thing,” he said. ”You walk away saying, 
‘Well, who knows?’”
A month later, a Jeopardy! rep-
resentative told Knudson he’d be on the show. From the time he heard to when he flew to Los An-geles, Knudson said he didn’t do 
anything to prepare.
“You don’t know what the questions are going to be,” he said. 
“It’s kind of a crap shoot.”
He said he’s really good at Triv-
ial Pursuit, and he was hoping for a sports category and a mathemat-ics category. He was also terrified of getting an opera category or an 
Old Testament category. But nei-
ther the categories he was scared of nor the categories he hoped for appeared on the show.
“The biggest help was all the 
video games I played as a kid,” he said. “The hardest part of the game is not the questions. It’s actually timing that signaling device.”
Samaa Kemal, a biochemistry 
and theater major and president of the UF Honors Ambassadors organization, said she appreciated 
the fact that her colleague has so 
many interests, and it shows in the Honors Program.
“He’s trying to make it less of a 
focus on students who are purely 
academic,” she said. “He’s making 
it more oriented to students with a liberal arts background. For us, and me specifically, that’s very ex-
citing.”
Knudson, who said he couldn’t 
even win his county’s academic 
quiz bowl competition in high school, said the show is “only re-
ally 20 minutes long, so it’s over 
before you know it.”

tax than anyone else. It’s really a 
discriminatory tax.”

owner of Tan USAweathering the down economy.” 
The rankings are calculated using statistics from seven 
categories, each weighted differently based on impor-
tance. 
The categories are as follows: graduation rate (7.5 per-
cent), undergraduate reputation (22.5 percent), graduation 
and freshman retention (20 percent), faculty resources (20 
percent), student selectivity (15 percent), financial resourc-
es (10 percent) and alumni giving rate (5 percent.) 
The rankings website, www.usnews.com, states that 
the rankings were created because “a college education is one of the most important — and one of the most costly 
— decisions that prospective students will ever make. For 
this reason, the editors of U.S. News believe that students and their families should have as much information as possible about the comparative merits of the educational 
programs at America’s colleges and universities.”
Machen said his goal for the 2010-2011 academic year is 
to get back to business as usual at UF. 
“The only way to get back on our feet, I really think . . 
. is to get more resources devoted to academics,” he said. “Not athletics or anything else, but resources to rebuild 
our academics.” 4, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, AUGUST 23, 2010

go inside to walk or ride your bike — maybe if we 
lived in a snowy place.” 
But Rohan Dass, a microbiology and cell-science 
transfer student, said the cost of the renovation was worth it because it will persuade more students to exercise —  it has even encouraged him to run more.
“I actually don’t normally use a track,” Dass 
said. “I’m actually not even much of a runner, but I just started because of Southwest Rec.”
Although he never saw the gym before reno-
vations began, Dass said he’s been going to the 
gym more than five days a week since moving to 
Gainesville a month ago. 
He said the weight room normally gets crowd-
ed, and it’d be nice to see a few more benches and 
dumbbells.
While the project isn’t completely done, David 
Bowles, director of RecSports, said there are only 
minor updates remaining, including a wall that needs to be repainted and a replacement for a coun-
ter.“It’s running great,” Bowles said. “Students 
walk in ... and their mouths drop.”
The center is under warranty for a year with the 
contractor, PPI Construction Management, so Rec-
Sports can ask the contractor to work on anything 
that needs to be fixed or upgraded during that in-
terval.
Because Southwest Recreation Center’s expan-
sions have freed up space at the Student Recreation 
and Fitness Center, he also said RecSports will see 
how to expand the strength and conditioning room 
at the Student Recreation and Fitness Center.
RecSports is having a grand open-
ing for the center on Tuesday at 4 p.m. with speeches, a ribbon-cutting cer-
emony and tours of the new facility, according to Bowles.
Following the grand opening, RecSports will 
host the RecSports Extravaganza, which will “show everything we have to offer students with RecS-ports,” Bowles said.
Both events are featured on RecSports’ Facebook 
group.The recreation center has a one-year warranty

Welcome back to the heart of the Gator Nation, Gators. And 
for the baby Gators, we on the Editorial Board would like to 
extend you a special welcome to our beloved UF, the very same school where our former quarterback now models underwear on the side. We hope you have adjusted well (stocking up on Ramen, avoiding your first hangover for as long as possible) to your first few days of college life in the land of never-ending orange and blue. 
In celebration of your academic triumphs and acceptance to 
the now-second-best university in Florida (ouch, Miami), we’d like to provide you with a different kind of welcome. Drop the campus map, avoid the Turlington area at all costs and keep reading for your special Welcome-To-UF-Here’s-What-You-Missed-This-Past-Year-While-We-Were-Busy-Shooting-Stu-dents-In-The-Face edition of 
Darts & Laurels
No need to hurry home in fear, Gators. We’re seriously hop-
ing this history doesn’t repeat itself anytime soon. And besides, locking your on-campus housing door wouldn’t really save you from the wrath of the University Police Department’s battering ram. We’re glad UPD admitted its Critical Incident Response Team was used innapropriately in the March incident that re-sulted in a UPD officer shooting a UF graduate student ... who walks with a cane ... in the face ... with a rifle. In consideration of that, we’d like to fire a Don’t-Tase-Me-Bro-Doesn’t-Even-Sound-That-Bad-Anymore LAUREL to the UPD with our sin-
cerest hopes it doesn’t shoot any of our new students in the face this year.
We’re watching out for you guys!Speaking of watching out for all of you, we’re throwing a 
Who-Cares-About-Civil-Liberties-Privacy-Or-Any-Of-That-Student-Voting-Mumbo-Jumbo DART at Big Brother. And 
maybe UF RecSports, too.
Aside from the fact that we’d rather not have to give anyone 
our fingerprints and hand scans just to watch “Jersey Shore” on the treadmill, UF students have resoundingly voiced their objections to any hand scanners at the Southwest Recreation Center any time they have been asked. But it’s OK; we have a fancy-schmancy gym with a track inside now! Who has time to worry about civil liberites when we’re building a $16.3 million gym? 
Student Body president Ashton Charles certainly has other 
things to worry about. We hope she can focus on not repeating history (seeing a trend?) and following in the footsteps of her predecessor by avoiding any outbursts of disorderly conduct. 
In all fairness, our former Student Body President Jordan 
Johnson wasn’t arrested in March for his drunken demands that a SNAP vehicle take him to his off-campus housing. And what Student Body president wouldn’t be a little peeved when a police officer didn’t recognize him? So, Ashton, we hope you 
make all our new Gators proud wearing your No-Arrests-For-Me LAUREL. 
We’re a little less hopeful our football team will avoid any 
arrests this year. 
For those of you who weren’t here last year, or any other 
year for that matter, some of our Gators football stars always manage to confuse glamour shots with mug shots. Both Frankie Hammond Jr., UF wide receiver, and Carlos Dunlap, former UF defensive end, were both arrested for driving under the influ-ence during the past nine months. In looking to improve our model behavior for our new Gators, we’re giving a chain-gang style DART to the UF football team. Please try to not get ar-
rested this year.
For one last time, the Editorial Board would like to send a 
warm welcome to all its new students to the place where “Don’t Tase me, Bro” was born. You’ll love it here. Freshman: Try new things, be individual
I’ve got some advice for freshmen.
No. 1: To my desperate brethren: If you’re really 
looking to find a girl, college is a great place. An Al-
ligator article published March 30 said, “Six out of 10 
new UF students will be women in fall 2010, which is the largest gender gap favoring female students that UF has ever had.”
But a word of advice: If you’re really that desperate 
for your first college relationship with a real woman, then change your major from engineering to nursing. Really.
No. 2: Student Government is dumber than Lindsay 
Lohan’s fingernails; resist the urge to care.
Do you really think you’ll get hired because you 
voted for the Unite Party every election or because you helped found a brand-new, doesn’t-do-anything party?
You won’t.There are only four things SG is good at: whining 
about the other SG party, spending money, passing meaningless resolutions and playing dirty during SG elections.
Want some practical advice? Buy a bunch of “I Vot-
ed” stickers and wear them during SG campaigns. The stickers ward off campaigners like Buffy the Vampire Slayer would ward off Edward “I-sparkle-more-than-a-
freakin’-fairy” Cullen.
No. 3: Girls, you’re not off the hook, either. You think 
intelligent debate is the ladies on “The View.” It’s not.
People almost care less about Team Edward vs. 
Team Jacob than they care about Unite Party or Student Alliance party. (I’m personally Team Pantazi every day 
of the week, especially if we’re talking about Erin An-drews instead of Bella.)No. 4: Don’t pick up a mu-
sical instrument, language or hobby. We’re not impressed.
Guys, we know you’re trying 
to grasp at some semblance of a conversation starter or look-ing for some way to set yourself 
apart from the rest of the drunk-
en morons that you call frater-
nity brothers. But instead, you come off more like an attention-craved, preteen, wannabe Casanova. 
Knowing the four chords repeated in “Wonderwall” 
and every other pathetic pop song doesn’t make you an impressive musician. We believe you’re a musician as much as we believe Sean Kingston can write his “girl” a symphony.No. 5: Be a hypocrite. Do something you 
never thought you did. 
If you always considered football to be mindless or 
dull, go to a football game. 
If you think yoga is only for health freaks, try it out. 
If you’re a hater like me, listen to Justin Bieber (just 
once though, we don’t want you to actually support the pre-pubescent, high-pitched Usher wannabe).
Or run for SG.No. 6: Most importantly — and never forget this — 
you must ignore any advice you read in the Alligator. We’re college students; we don’t know anything. Don’t obey my every word. And certainly don’t take me seri-ously. 
The Alligator exists to inform, not to be your mom 
and dad. Our advice is about as wise as Ke$ha when she wakes up in the morning.

Each fall at UF marks the beginning of a new era as anoth-
er group of recently admitted Gators arrive on campus. These students can look forward to defining moments 
that will be etched in their minds and will live on long after they walk across the stage on graduation day.  
For me, the fall of 2006 was characterized by the annual 
football buzz for the year, primarily consisting of talks of Tim Tebow and Percy Harvin, an 8 a.m. Bugs and People lecture with professor Barfield and yearning to get involved.
As a freshman on a campus of more than 52,000, my usual 
compass was out of whack. If navigating to class wasn’t difficult enough, the ever pressing “How do I get involved?” question seemed too much to bear. I tried to digest the alphabet soup of organizations, but I couldn’t begin to decipher the difference 
between the C.S.A.I. and the C.L.S.  Not to mention, there are 
more than 900 student groups that I could potentially join.
Yet, by sifting through the student information guide, Gator 
Times, and wandering around on the third floor of the Reitz Union, I soon discovered that there is place for everyone. You simply need to play to your strengths.  If you get involved in things you are genuinely interested in, the rest will follow.  
Some of you may want to get in-
volved in Student Government. Allow 
me to offer you an important piece of advice: Do not get dis-
couraged.  I thought SG’s Freshman Leadership Council or Stu-
dent Alumni Association Florida Cicerones would be the best options for me. I applied for both and was not selected.  
While both are truly phenomenal organizations, in hind-
sight it was the best thing. Had I been chosen for either one of the other two, I may never have continued to search for things to get involved in and missed the opportunity to discover orga-nizations that better fit my interests and skills. Ultimately I got involved with the Accent Speaker’s Bureau and Florida Blue 
Key’s Legislative Day.  
Specifically within SG, there are a wide variety of ways to 
get involved in whatever you may be interested in. If you are 
technologically savvy, we have a Technology Cabinet and other technological positions within agencies that could further de-velop your skills. Music enthusiasts may find SG Productions a great fit. This group plays an active role in planning concerts and hosting artists such as John Legend, Slightly Stoopid and Lil’ Wayne.  And those of you with interests in politics, debat-ing or parliamentary procedure, SG Senate could be an area for you to thrive. 
Just so you know, SG at UF plays a tremendous role in mak-
ing sure you have a fabulous collegiate experience. It directs your student activity fees into recreational sports programs 
and facilities, the Reitz Union and hundreds of student orga-
nizations. This allows for everything from intramural sports to new food options in the Reitz Union to be made possible.
We are all truly blessed to attend the best university in the 
nation. Whether you have one semester or four years remain-ing, cherish the time you have at UF. You have a unique op-portunity to excel academically and hone your extracurricular activities. Welcome to new Gators and welcome back to the returning Gators. I am honored to have the opportunity to rep-
resent you for the next year and will continue to work on behalf 
of all students at the University of Florida. Go Gators!

Speaking Out On behalf of the UF Police Department, 
I would like to welcome all of our new students, as well as returning students, 
back to campus. I also want to take this oppor-tunity to discuss our department, convey the 
mission our staff strives to achieve daily and 
introduce each of you to the programming and coordination our department provides that may help you safely enjoy your stay while living, studying and working within the UF and Gainesville communities.
UPD is a fully operational and accredited 
police department. Our department provides the law enforcement response to the university 
community 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.  The mission of UPD is to preserve a safe, 
secure campus environment where diverse 
social, cultural and academic values are al-lowed to develop and prosper through a com-bination of reactive, proactive and educational 
law enforcement services. To help achieve that 
mission, UPD uses open, honest and straight-forward communications with the community members we serve. 
Our department also provides several 
programs designed for your specific personal safety needs. I encourage each of you to look into using the Student Nighttime Auxiliary Program. SNAP is a free service funded by 
Student Government that provides a point-to-point escort from 6:30 
p.m. to 3:00 a.m., sev-en days a week from anywhere on the UF 
campus. The Rape Aggression Defense is an-
other popular program offered to our female 
students and is designed to provide strategies and training on how to better protect oneself and avoid becoming a victim of a personal crime. 
To review our department’s entire range of 
programs, contact our department’s Commu-nity Services Division at 352-392-1409 or visit our department’s website, ufl.edu.
 Of course, UPD also recognizes that our community extends beyond the mere borders of campus. 
Because of this recognition, UPD main-
tains a very close working relationship with both the Gainesville Police Department and 
the Alachua County Sheriff’s Office. For those 
of you who do not live on campus, these are the agencies that would provide the assistance you may need. 
Once again, I would like to welcome all of 
you to UF. I look forward to working with you and hope that your experience at UF is a safe, positive and rewarding one.

� THE ORIGINAL MORATORIUM WAS 
ISSUED IN JULY.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
A six-month ban on deepwater drilling 
in the Gulf of Mexico would directly put 
more than 9,000 people out of work and 
indirectly affect another 14,000 jobs, ac-
cording to a memo from the nation’s top drilling regulator.
The federal document, which weighed 
the economic impact and alternatives to the ban, was sent to Interior Secretary Ken Salazar on July 10 by Michael Bromwich.
Salazar issued a moratorium in June, 
but it was struck down by a federal judge 
in New Orleans after oil and gas drilling 
interests said it wasn’t justified following the Gulf oil spill.
The Obama administration issued a 
new moratorium July 12 — two days after 
the memo — that stressed new evidence of 
safety concerns.
 The White House hopes the revised 
ban will pass muster within the U.S. court 
system.
The moratoriums were put in place fol-
lowing the Deepwater Horizon rig explo-sion April 20 that killed 11 people. Mil-
lions of gallons of oil spilled into the Gulf after the rig sank.
Some energy experts, engineering 
consultants and Gulf Coast leaders have joined Big Oil to ask Salazar to change his 
mind. Drilling was safe be-fore the BP spill, they said, 
and Gulf communities that 
depend on the industry 
were suffering unfairly.
Interior Department spokesman Matt 
Lee-Ashley said the agency has been very clear that the economic impacts of the moratorium would need to be addressed and noted the Obama administration se-cured an agreement with BP to set up a $100 million fund rig workers affected by 
the policy.
“In light of the current risks of deepwa-
ter drilling as illustrated by the BP Deep-
water Horizon Spill and the potential im-pacts of another spill, the moratorium is 
necessary and appropriate. With that said, 
the worst-case economic impact estimates from three months ago have not been re-alized. The reality on the ground suggests 
that the impacts are less than we initially 
projected as a potential worst-case scenar-io,” Lee-Ashley said.Government: Drill ban would cost about 23,000 jobs

By ALEXANDER KLAUSNER

Q: What are the newer issues 
and challenges that face the uni-
versity? 
A: This is somewhat of a hope-
ful prophecy: that our budget is-
sues are behind us. We’re going 
to focus on the academic issues of the university: delivering good courses and academic programs to students [and] faculty’s research activities. We’ll be basically getting back to the business of the Univer-sity of Florida that’s really been parked for the last few years as 
we’ve waded through. You proba-
bly saw some of it from your home or from watching it. We’ve been through a difficult time in terms of the budget issues we’ve had to face, and it’s somewhat been dis-tracting, I think, to the university. Hopefully, our budget issues are behind us. We can get back to the 
best teaching, the best research. 
The stuff we like to do most. It’s all predicated upon the economy holding together and the state’s economy holding together.
Q: So you would say the goal 
of this year is to get back to busi-ness as usual? 
A: Perfectly said.
Q: In addition to bringing in 
new faculty, what is the univer-
sity going to be doing? Are you going to bring back any programs that may have been cut? 
A: The new thrust that was 
started last year, probably before you were thinking about it, but distance learning. And it involves 
in some ways Santa Fe College. 
You know, that “Gator Den” we’re building over there. And having online degrees available. One of our dilemmas is that the campus is packed. Some people think we have more people than we can ac-commodate on this campus. And yet the demand for our programs 
continues [to be] pretty high. So 
we’re going to try to emphasize distance learning. We have goals to increase the number of – last year, for example, we had 3,500 students enrolled in distance learn-ing. In 2014, we hope to have 7,000 students taking distance learning courses.
Q: In addition to increasing 
diversity in faculty, is there any-thing being done to increase the diversity of ideas?
A: Very good question. One 
of the ways you do that is you hire people from different back-grounds. You know, some people criticize universities for not hir-
ing our graduates, but if you go 
through a graduate program here, you will learn from the faculty here and your ideas will be influenced by them. . . . The handicap has been we haven’t been hiring many new people. So that drops the potential there, but we are focused on that, and I think any great university 
tries to seek diversity of ideas. 
Q: How many more years do you see yourself being president of the university. Once you’re 
done with the presidency, in a perfect world, once you’ve left your mark and instilled all the ideas that you want to promote here, what would the campus be like?
A: It’d be a large, diverse cam-
pus, and a public university in 
north Florida ... 
I’m going to be right here. My 
game plan is pretty clear. I’m go-
ing to serve whatever time the Board of Trustees want me to serve as president, and then I intend to go back on the faculty of this uni-versity because it’s got everything I want. It’s got diversity of ideas, 
it’s got lots of interesting programs 
and it’s got a great future in that sense. No one’s ever asked me that before, you know that? 
Q: What are the things that you 
personally really want to promote here? 
A: I think the key for us is aca-
demics. That’s who we are. Our 
Board of Trustees recently has re-
affirmed our preeminence in aca-demic endeavors. And the unique part of University of Florida, not the only part, but the thing that separates us from other universi-ties, this state and elsewhere, is our graduate education, and our professional education and our 
research. So that’s why Florida’s 
different than all the other univer-sities in the state. We have a more developed set of programs in grad-uate education and professional education. . . . That’s what I want 
to see us continue to move out on, 
and that’s the kind of campus that I would like to be affiliated with. 
Q: With all the responsibili-
ties you have being the presi-dent of the university and ev-erything that goes along with it, how do you stay in touch with the needs of the students? 
A: Yeah, it’s really hard. The no-
tion that one individual can con-nect with 50,000 students is a false notion. You can’t do it. So we try to get inputs through other ways. I meet with the president of the student body at least once every two weeks, preferably during the year every week. And she brings to me the agenda of student govern-ment. Now, that doesn’t represent all the students, but it’s a represen-
tative sample of the students. Then 
we have the Office of Student Af-fairs, which has connections to all student life—the dorms [and] the Greek system. And their tentacles are out there, and we try to keep in touch through them as well. And finally, the colleges have their own academic agendas and they’re 
much closer to the students than 
are we. And all those ideas fun-nel up to the administration, so I at least know what’s going on. A little sidebar is that my e-mail in-box is always packed. I mean I get between 100 to 200 e-mails a day. And it’s as mundane as, “I got a parking ticket that I don’t de-
serve,” or, “I couldn’t get in a class 
that I want to get in,” or something more laudy [sic], like “I want to talk to you about my plans for the future.” And while I don’t always respond to those, it gives me a 
sense of things they want. 
Q: Through all those methods, 
do you feel that you are in fact 
able keep in touch with the needs of the students?
A: No. I’ve accepted the fact 
that I’m always running behind the car, and I can’t ever catch it. So I think it would be a mistake for 
me to assume that I’ve got it fig-
ured out. It’s really somewhat of a guilt problem because I can never catch it. I keep running after it, but I never catch it. 
Q: Do you believe that the suc-
cess that our athletic department has been experiencing has helped build the reputation of the uni-
versity, attract more students and 
increased the prestige of the uni-versity?
A: No, I don’t. There are some 
cases where notoriety from athlet-ics causes increased student appli-cations in the following year, but our student application has been somewhat flat for the past three 
or four years. It’s plenty high, but 
it’s not growing. A couple colleges report 10 or 15 percent increases in applications after they’ve had some athletic success. I don’t think that’s the case for us. I think we’re already well known for academics. I think what athletics has done [is] provide an incredibly fun experi-
ence for students and alumni. 
Q: I’ve heard that there’s a de-
bate within the university wheth-
er or not the university should become the flagship university in the state. Do you think it should, and why?
A: Well, most people think we 
are the flagship university in the state. The thing that’s hanging 
there is that we don’t have an of-
ficial designation of that. We’re the oldest, the largest, arguably the most prestigious; so most people will tell you that we are the flag-ship university. In my opinion, we’re past that argument. We are what we are. Our goals are set on a national and international set of standards, not on a state-wide set of standards. So it’s not that necessary that we make it clear 
to everybody in the state that we 
are the flagship university. I think at one time, it may have been im-portant. To a lot of alumni, it’s still important, but I don’t think it’s that important to worry about it anymore. 
Q: Why is that?A: Because our goals are nation-
al/international, not local. Some people are adamant that they want us to be recognized as being better than –  you pick one of the other universities. I don’t care. I want to be as good as Michigan. I don’t want to be better than somebody in Florida. So our goals are a little bit different than they used to be. 
Q: With the investigation 
of the Corry Village incident wrapped up, would you care to comment on the incident and in-vestigation?
A: First of all, the incident was 
a tragedy for all concerned. This young man was injured [and] may have permanent damage or 
repercussions from his injury that 
certainly delayed his academic program. The ultimate resolu-tion that came about after the in-vestigation resulted in the career of a very promising police officer being terminated. It is a difficult situation that I think everyone in 
the university is sorry about. I am 
pleased that the University Police Department went at the investi-gation so thoroughly. It wasn’t the state department of police, it wasn’t the state’s attorney, it was the University Police Department who analyzed it and came up with their own conclusions that they 
had made some mistakes. So that 
kind of integrity should be reassur-
ing to the community, you know? 
I hate to say that that’s a good out-
come, but it’s reaffirming to me that the police department looked at itself, realized it had made some mistakes and took steps to correct that going forward. 
Q: Do you feel that 
perhaps the police may need an oversight group? 
A: I think the police chief herself 
has called for a community advi-sory board, but that is not the same as oversight. I think the oversight of the police department ulti-mately is my responsibility. And I think a lot of people have to share in the inputs for that. I think bet-ter communication from the police 
department to the community [is 
important]. 
Q: Are there any plans for an 
oversight board that have been discussed?
A: There are none, no. The fo-
cus of [the community advisory committee] is communication. The way you put the board concept on 
the table was as a controlling body. The police department won’t be 
controlled by an outside board. 
Q: Well, not control, but if any-
thing should happen ... 
A: They answer to me. They 
would ultimately answer to me if that’s the case. 
Q: Do you have any advice for 
incoming freshmen and transfer students? 
A: Yeah, my advice to them is: 
We have over 900 clubs and cam-pus organizations. A lot of what you get out of college doesn’t oc-cur in the classroom. And I’ve 
never seen a place with more op-
portunities for participation than we have here. Even if you are not a joiner, you owe it to yourself for your education to look at some or-ganizations on campus that you may not know anything about and get involved with something. It’ll make your experience more 
enriching, it’ll help develop you 
as a person and I think at the end 
of the day you’ll feel better about 
your education. If you don’t break 
this campus down from its mega-size into smaller units – I don’t care whether it’s the Alligator, or the marching band or the step-
dancing  club –  you will not have 
a connection to the university, and you won’t enjoy it as much.
Q: And what is your message 
for the outgoing students who are preparing to graduate?
A: (laughs) Go slow, don’t get 
too disappointed that the market-place isn’t grabbing you up right 
now and think long haul. You may 
have to take a job right now that may not be your lifelong goal, but it’s something that if it can keep you going down life’s path, do it. This country will turn around, and it’s economy. And the graduates of our university will have a great opportunity once it does, but right 
now it’s a little tough. So just go 
slow, so maybe take a bite out of some opportunity that may not be everything you wanted when you started college.Bern Notice

Campus Crisis: Looking Back
Editors note: This story was originally 
published in the Aug. 11 issue of the Alligator. 
By KAT BEIN
Alligator Staff Writer
The UF police department has completed 
and released its internal investigation report regarding the actions of the Critical Incident Response Team on March 2, when officers shot a graduate student in the face.
The investigation found the CIRT was 
used inappropriately. Commanding officer Lt. Stacy Ettel, after 17 years of service, will be relieved of duty.
“I think this goes back to the severity of 
the situation,” Stump said. “This is one of the most critical incidents this department has ever been involved in, and you have to ac-knowledge that.”
According to Stump, there were three 
major flaws in procedure that night. First, she said, the University Police CIRT never should have responded. Instead, a SWAT team should have been called in, she said.
“The design of CIRT is to respond to ac-
tive shooters,” she said. “It’s really not in-tended nor has it ever been intended to pro-tect an individual from harm.”
Secondly, Ettel should have notified chief 
Stump or a patrol director and informed them of the situation.
Finally, officers should have contacted 
members of the Critical Intervention Team, who have been trained to deal with those ex-periencing mental health problems.
Though Stump said she feels CIRT “abso-
lutely” acted inappropriately that night, she sees no reason to terminate the program.
Stump said she hopes the conclusion of 
the investigation will help students move be-yond this incident and rebuild relations and trust with UPD officers.
“I hope you realize we’ve tried to be as 
thorough as we can and look at ourselves honestly,” she said. “It’s always been our in-tent [to be transparent] ... the trust that maybe we lost through this incident, I hope we may be able to gain.”Editors note: This story was originally published in the July 31 issue of the Al -

Four of the five officers involved in the 
Corry Village shooting incident on March 2 
have been reinstated to their duties with the University Police Department.
Only Lt. Stacy Ettel, the commanding of-
ficer when 35-year-old Kofi Adu-Brempong was shot in his apartment, has not been rein-stated.
The other four officers-Bill Ledger, Keith 
Smith, William Sasser and James Mabry-were reinstated Thursday to their former positions, except for Sasser who will now join the mo-torcycle unit.
Since the incident, UPD has maintained a 
full staff by moving officers who were nor-mally off-patrol to patrol duty, according to UPD spokesman Capt. Jeff Holcomb.
Meanwhile, the officers have been doing 
non-uniformed, office duties, Holcomb said.
Sasser has been assisting Holcomb with bike registrations, answering phone calls and 
other office duties, Holcomb said.
“We’re still working through the final piec-
es of the investigation process and the internal 
affairs process,” she said.
According to a UF press release, the uni-
versity contracted the public-safety firm Mar-golis Healy & Associates to “evaluate UF’s in-ternal affairs review protocols and ensure that the police department strictly followed them 
during the internal review process.”
UF police officers shot the Ghanian gradu-
ate student in the face while responding to a 
neighbor’s call. The neighbor heard screaming from Adu-Brempong’s on-campus Corry Vil-lage apartment, according to police reports.
Adu-Brempong would not allow the police 
officers into his apartment, according to Alli-
gator archives.
Officers talked to him through an open 
window for about two and half hours before he fell silent, police reports said.
The officers said they forced their way 
into the apartment because they feared Adu-Brempong had harmed himself, according to Alligator archives.

UF faculty members can now 
go to Haiti without restrictions, 
according to a July 12 memo from UF Provost Joseph Glover and Vice President for Student Affairs 
Patricia Telles-Irvin.
After the country suffered a 
7.0-magnitude earthquake Jan. 
12, a memo was released Feb. 5 announcing restrictions against travel to Haiti.
The original announcement said no UF-related trips were al-
lowed without specific approval 
from UF administrative officials, but now UF faculty members can visit Haiti as long as they fill out travel forms. 
The memo also advised fac-
ulty to consider warnings against traveling to Haiti. 
Graduate students are allowed 
to visit the country if they sign a waiver with two weeks’ advance. 
They must also meet seven 
specific requirements, such as the possession of “personal maturity” and medical insurance.
Undergraduate students are 
still not allowed to visit the coun-try in any UF-affiliated capacity.UF lifts travel ban

Students who study late will 
have a little more space to spread 
out in the fall semester.
Student Body President Ash-
ton Charles announced during 
the July 20 Student Senate meet-ing that the ground and first 
floors of the Reitz Union will be 
open until 3 a.m. beginning in the fall.
The Hub, which is the current 
late-night study center, will likely close at 8 p.m. on weekdays start-ing in the fall
Currently, the Reitz Union 
closes anywhere between 9 p.m. 
and 1:30 a.m., depending on the 
day of the week.
“It’s just a logical move,” 
Charles said of the 
change. “We’ll be 
saving money and allowing more space 
for students to be there.”
She said moving late-night 
study hours to the Reitz Union will save the university about $35,000. 
The costs of keeping the 
ground floor and first floor open late will be taken out of the Reitz Union budget.
In the fall, the Taco Bell and 
Starbucks in the Reitz Union will 
introduce later business hours, 
and Subway may follow suit, she said.
Charles said this move not 
only saves money, but it address-es some safety concerns created while the late study hours were held in the Hub.
“[The Hub] was really difficult 
to get to,” Charles said. “People were trying to park, or if they lived on campus they had to walk in the dark.”
The Reitz Union has more se-
curity and more parking, Charles said.
She said she has seen many 
students studying at the Reitz 
Union until it closes anyway.
“It’s just legitimizing the fact 
that people can study here,” 
Charles said.Reitz to

  UF has more eco-friendly 
buildings than any other Ameri-
can university.
  A recently published paper about buildings in colleges rec-
ognized UF as having the most certiﬁ  cations by Leadership in Energy and Environmental De-
sign.
  The LEED certiﬁ  cation system 
is operated by the U.S. Green 
Building Council, a Washington-
based non-proﬁ  t organization. 
  In 2003, UF became the ﬁ  rst organization in Florida to receive 
a gold LEED rating.
In 2008, UF became the ﬁ  rst 
organization in Florida to receive 
a platinum rating, which is the 
highest rank.
  According to the paper, writ-
ten by green building expert Jerry 
Yudelson, UF is a national trend-
setter that is “well-known for [its] green building standards.”
  Some of UF’s 15 certiﬁ  ed 
buildings include Library West and Rinker Hall, with gold cer-
tiﬁ  cations, and Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n 
Stadium’s 60,000-square-foot ex-pansion, which earned UF’s only platinum rating.
  Harvard University, with 39 
LEED projects, which are LEED buildings that are not yet com-pleted, is second to UF’s 60 LEED projects in the ranking. 
  UF’s policy requires all new 
construction to earn at least a gold rating. 
The university’s next step is to 
upgrade existing buildings, said 
Bahar Armaghani, assistant di-
rector for the UF LEED program.     UF has most green buildings among universitiesENVIRONMENT

    Previously, there were two separate 
centers—the Counseling Center, which was 
located in Peabody Hall,  and the Student 
Mental Health Center, located in the inﬁ  r-mary—which confused students, said Sher-ry Benton, the center’s director. Gatorwell Health Services is also housed in the center, which opened May 10.
  By consolidating the centers, costs were 
cut by half a million dollars, but no one was ﬁ  red, she said.
  The Counseling and Wellness Center 
offers a myriad of free services for UF stu-dents including counseling and biofeed-back, which uses a sensor for sweat produc-
tion and pulse rate.
  Benton said mental health is important 
for students’ academic success. 
  “The two most common problems with 
students are anxiety and depression,” she said. “It’s hard to be a student with memory 
loss and lack of concentration.”
  In September, when all the services are 
operational, Benton said she expects the center to hold a grand opening. Health centers consolidate, 
become more accessible

 A Gainesville woman just couldn’t resist the divine or-
der to take a dip in Bernie Machen’s pool. 
  At 10:45 p.m. on July 26, staff members at the University 
of Florida President’s House called police and reported that 
a woman was trespassing and swimming in the pool, accord-
ing to Capt. Jeff Holcomb, public information ofﬁ  cer for the 
University    Police Department. 
  This is not the ﬁ  rst time that trespassers  have attempted to 
swim in the President’s House pool, Holcomb said. 
  The ofﬁ  cers who found the woman, who was noticeably dis-
oriented, thought she was drunk. 
  As it turns out, the woman was not drunk. 
  While ofﬁ  cers talked with the woman, according to 
Holcomb, she told them that God told her to 
get in the pool.   After ofﬁ  cers apprehended and spoke with her, the woman 
Baker Acted herself. Under the Baker Act, patients are taken to mental health facilities, where they are observed for a maximum 
of three days.
  Ofﬁ  cers took the woman to Shands, where she was presum-
ably assessed, and then taken to Shands Vista, one of the two 
local Baker Act facilities.
  Before leaving, ofﬁ  cers gave her a trespass warning, which 
means she could be arrested if she returns to UF campus.
  Because of the Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act  restrictions, her name cannot be released. COPS16, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, AUGUST 23, 2010

 A 22-year-old UF student was ar-
rested and charged with trafﬁ  cking 
large amounts of marijuana and co-caine on June 29 after attempting to run from police ofﬁ  cers.
  Cameron Schmidt, who was wear-
ing a backpack ﬁ  lled with what was later found to be drug paraphernalia and a gun, was stopped around 11 p.m. while walking east on Northwest Third Avenue with a friend, according to the Gainesville Police Department report.
  A Gainesville Police ofﬁ  cer ﬁ  rst no-
ticed the pair walking down the street holding red Solo cups.
  When asked what was in the cups, 
both Schmidt and his friend told the ofﬁ  cer they were drinking whiskey and Coke. When the ofﬁ  cer asked the two to step to the front of the squad car, they started running south on Northwest 12th Terrace, the report 
stated.
  The ofﬁ  cer chased the men in his 
car and caught up with them in the 
old Mellow Mushroom parking lot on University Avenue. Schmidt was caught, but his friend continued to run south until he was out of sight, the re-port stated.
  Schmidt spun around in the ofﬁ  -
cer’s grip and started ﬁ  ghting him to get away. He punched the ofﬁ  cer in 
the face multiple times and pulled his 
hair, the report said.
  Schmidt threw his backpack away 
during the ﬁ  ght and yelled, “I have cocaine … I can’t go to jail. I’m in school.”
  Schmidt was ﬁ  nally Tasered, 
which stopped him from resisting long enough for back-up ofﬁ  cers to 
arrive. He was evaluated by EMS and 
refused medical treatment, according to the police report.
  Schmidt’s friend was found by 
a K-9 Justice unit at College Manor Apartments at 1216 SW 2nd Ave., the report said.
  A search of Schmidt’s backpack 
turned up 32.5 grams of marijuana packaged in separate plastic bags, 56.6 grams of cocaine and a loaded .22 cali-ber Sig Sauer handgun.
  Schmidt has been charged with 
battery on an ofﬁ  cer, carrying a con-cealed weapon without a license, selling cannabis within 1,000 feet of a school, possession of drug para-phernalia, trafﬁ  cking drugs, resisting arrest without violence and an open container violation, according to the report.

 UF students and faculty members 
received emergency text messages and e-mails early May 31 warning of a crime that occurred in the pedestrian tunnel under 13th Street.
  There was just one problem; the rob-
bery likely did not happen, according to UPD Capt. Jeff Holcomb.
  Brett House, a 19-year-old 
Gainesville resident, called the Uni-versity Police Department at 8 a.m. on May 31, according to UPD Lt. Alton McDilda. House reported that he had been robbed.
  Holcomb said House told police that 
at 3 a.m. someone hit him from behind and stole about $45 worth of marijuana from his backpack.
  Later during questioning, House ad-
mitted to making up the crime, blaming it on his narcotics use, Holcomb said.
  “He didn’t remember reporting the 
crime to us,” he said.
  UPD will ﬁ  le a complaint with the 
State Attorney’s Ofﬁ  ce against House for ﬁ  ling a false police report, Holcomb said Thursday. The complaint can turn into a criminal charge. House did not answer repeated phone calls. No robbery in Norman tunnel

 A godmother-to-be from Cit-
rus Springs was arrested by the Gainesville Police Department for attacking her 6-months-pregnant friend while the two were driving in 
west Gainesville early on May 9.
  Jessica Harris, 24, was riding in 
the passenger’s seat when the two 
got into an argument, according to a GPD report.
  Harris, who had been drink-
ing that night, became increasingly angered and attempted to pull the keys out of the ignition while the car 
headed west on Newberry Road, the 
report stated.
  As the driver pulled into a parking 
lot, Harris became physically violent, swinging her legs over the center console to kick her pregnant friend in the stomach, the report stated.
  During the scufﬂ  e, the driver 
was on the phone with a friend who told police he heard the woman say, “Don’t kick me in my stomach, you know I’m pregnant.”
  When police arrived, they found 
bruises on the woman’s belly from the kick, as well as scratches on her arms..
  The woman was then taken to the 
hospital by EMS workers, the report stated.
  Harris lost an artiﬁ  cial toenail and 
left index ﬁ  nger in the ﬁ  ght, the re-port stated. 
  After being read her rights, Har-
ris said the driver hit her in the jaw and admitted to knowing the woman was pregnant, which is a special of-fense, the report stated.

of aggravated battery on a pregnant female. The bail is set at $5,000. Woman kicks pregnant friend

of the toughest budget decisions in de-cades but has high hopes for Gainesville by planning to improve the economic, 
environmental and neighborhood de-
velopment.
Lowe’s first goal is to prepare for 
budget discussions by evaluating pro-gram costs and benefits, he said.
He also wants to partner with the 
Alachua County School Board to “see if we can work to improve student achievement in the school system.”
While Lowe said he can’t please 
everybody, there are benefits to being mayor, too.
“You do get to make a difference in 
the community that you love,” he said.
Lowe said he views his job as “a 
challenge and an opportunity to serve 
the community,” and as a way to prac-
tice what he learned from being a city commissioner.
“I can’t imagine what it would be 
like assuming the office of mayor with-out serving as commissioner ,” he said.18, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, AUGUST 23, 2010

The Florida Public Service 
Commission approved a plan on Thursday to build a 100-megawatt biomass plant at the Gainesville Regional Utilities facility in Deer-haven.
The plant is a joint-effort be-
tween GRU and American Renew-ables, an energy plant developing company.
“The PSC has taken an impor-
tant step today toward significant-ly expanding Florida’s commit-ment to renewable energy,” said Jim Gordon, American Renew-ables chief executive officer, in a press release. “The Gainesville Re-newable Energy Center will bring reliable, cost-effective renewable 
energy to GRU cus-tomers and spur sig-nificant economic de-velopment in North 
Central Florida.”
GRU and American Renewables 
are entering into a 30-year energy contract under which American Renewables will build, own and operate the facility, according to the release.
GRU will buy and use 100 per-
cent of the plant’s energy output, which will be generated by burn-ing local leftovers from logging residue and wood processing plants.
The biomass plant will help keep GRU’s facilities updated, as well as protect customers from rising fuel costs while providing long-term savings, said GRU Gen-eral Manager Bob Hunzinger in the release. At first, customers may see a small increase in their bills
Construction is set to begin in 
December, although customers will not be directly influenced until late 2013, according to the release.

The School Board of Alachua 
County voted June 1 to implement a 
district-wide school uniform require-ment for students in kindergarten through 12th grade. 
Beginning in the fall, students will be 
required to wear uniforms consisting of solid-colored pants, shorts or skirts and a solid-colored shirt or blouse with a col-lar. The colors of the uniforms will be chosen by the individual schools.
The five-member board approved the 
plan in a 3-2 decision.
“The kids, unfortunately, are getting 
more and more outrageous with the clothes they wear,” school board chair-woman Virginia Childs said.
Students have been coming to school 
wearing slippers, pajama bottoms, bag-gy pants and overly revealing tops, she said.
“It’s very distracting for other people 
in the class to have that show going on,” she said. 
Childs said the new policy will not only help students focus more on their 
studies, but she expects it will help alle-
viate bullying and peer pressure.
Tina Pinkoson, who voted against the 
uniform policy, said she was surprised it passed because she has gotten mostly negative feedback on the issue.
Pinkoson said it should be the par-
ents’ responsibility to tell their children what to wear. She also said school uni-
forms will become a financial burden 
on the school district 
when it has to pur-chase the clothes for students who are un-able to afford them.
“I don’t think that 
it has anything to do with the academic 
learning that’s going on in the schools,” she 
said. “There [are] bigger fish to fry, and we should be looking at those issues.”
Wiley Dixon, principal of Gainesville 
High School, said the seven high school principals in Alachua County sent a let-ter to the board recommending the poli-cy not be approved. 
The principals felt such a policy in 
high schools was unnecessary because 
there was never a problem with enforc-
ing the old dress code, he said.School board approves

Liz woke up one morning and found a 
voicemail on her phone.
The call was from her bank, USAA, no-
tifying her that her account had suspicious 
charges on it and was flagged for fraud.
She checked her statements, and discov-
ered two fraudulent purchases, each for over $100 at a gas station in Tampa.
But Liz hadn’t been in Tampa. She was 
asleep in her Gainesville residence when the 
charges were made.
Liz, who requested her last name not be 
used, is just one of the unknown number of 
Gainesville residents who had their credit card information saved onto a gas-pump 
skimmer and downloaded via Bluetooth by 
identity bandits. 
The 25-year-old said she frequently 
bought gas from the Kangaroo station at 3424 
SW Williston Road, where two skimmers 
were found on the weekend of July 24. 
Before the charges appeared, the last pur-
chase made with her card was gas from that station, she said. 
She responded by calling the bank and 
discussing the problem with USAA’s fraud department. After about a week, she was able to recover her money. 
Bob Page, Alachua County president for Alarion Bank, said that under Federal Regu-lation E, consumers who have been  victim-ized only need to pay up to $50. Of course, that depends on whether or not the bank 
deems the claim legitimate. 
The skimmers haven’t just been affecting 
consumers, but local businesses as well.
Patrick Daniel, co-owner of Go Video, 
a small video rental shop located inside the 
Chevron at 5221 NW 43rd St., said that he has been losing business because people are re-fusing to leave their credit card information 
with him. 
Go Video rents videos to customers by the 
day. To charge its customers, Go Video must 
keep credit card information on file in order 
to prevent people from absconding with its 
movies. To accommodate worried custom-ers, Daniel has had to take cash deposits on his rentals. 
“I couldn’t explain to them that the skim-
mers, they get you at the pumps,” he said. 
Daniel also said that he has noticed a major 
increase in people who walk inside to pay.
Liz now pays inside with cash.
“I’ve gotten yelled at [by my husband 
Dustin] for not paying inside,” she said. “If I 
just swipe at the gas pump, I get talked to.”Skimmers scam at pumps

With costs rising for city services, 
churches and nonprofit organizations 
will soon have to pay a fire service fee.
The special assessment fee for fire 
services was adopted by the Gainesville City Commission to balance shortages in Gainesville’s budget for next year. All property owners, residential homes and 
business offices are included in the as-
sessment, and no properties are exempt.
The City Commission has proposed to 
establish the fees based on factors such as the building’s hazard class, which is dic-tated by what the building is made of, the rate of flame spread and occupancy.Gene Prince, interim fire chief for  
Gainesville Fire Rescue, said 14 percent of the city’s budget is for the fire depart-ment, and the department’s availability, demand and incident reports are used to determine the costs of operating and the level of service for the community. He said the fee won’t fluctuate like other taxes.

alizes how insulting this is to volunteers,” said Jasmine Nebhrajani, a UF political science senior. “Charging charities and nonprofit buildings just isn’t right.”City implements fire fee

It’s been about a month since UF’s 
campus-wide tobacco ban went into ef-
fect, and so far it doesn’t seem like much has changed.
The ban, effective since July 1, is in-
tended to promote healthy lifestyles on campus and discourage the use of any to-bacco products, even smokeless tobacco 
like snuff or electronic cigarettes. 
All students, faculty, visitors and con-
struction workers are within the ban’s 
breadth. However, while that seems all encompassing, the ban has one major flaw 
— it’s difficult to enforce.
Capt. Jeff Holcomb, public information 
officer for the UF police department, said 
it’s hard to gauge the ban’s effectiveness 
because it’s not punishable like a law, but remains just a policy.“I haven’t heard any uproar about it 
from either side, either negative or posi-
tive,” Holcomb said. “So, hopefully that means people are complying.”
Frankie Tai, a secretary at the UF Stu-
dent Health Care Center, said there was 
an influx of people signing up for smoking 
cessation courses in the weeks leading up 
to July 1, but said it didn’t last.
“I think it was the big scare that it was 
going into effect, but things have leveled out now,” Tai said.
While some students and employees 
cross University Avenue for 
their smoke breaks, others, without fear of reprimand, 
just stay where they are.
“I just don’t see the real validity to the 
whole ban. There’s nothing they can do,” 
said Matt Watts, a junior journalism stu-
dent who sat smoking in front of Weimer Hall.
“I’ll continue to smoke on campus until 
Bernie Machen himself says don’t do it,” he said.20, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, AUGUST 23, 2010

The UF Alpha Phi Alpha frater-

The UF chapter beat out more

Alpha Phi Alpha’s UF President 
Hamardo Sinclair said he enjoyed the recognition of the award, but doesn’t want to lose sight of the true 
goal of positively influencing more 
people and touching more lives. 
“Our plans for the future are not 
only to continue what we started with this recognition as Outstand-ing College Chapter of the Year,”  Sinclair said. “We want to continue to think of new ways to have bigger and better results.”
The chapter completed all three 
of the fraternity’s national programs this year. 
The chapter did Project Alpha, 
a program where members taught boys about STDs and pregnancy prevention; “Go-to-High-School, Go-to-College,” a mentoring pro-gram that encouraged young men 
to prepare for their academic future; 
and “A Voteless People is a Hope-less People,” where the chapter helped 17-year-olds and low-income people register to vote.

� BARS ARE HOSTING 
SHAVED-LEG AND HIGH-HEEL NIGHTS.
Editor’s note: This story was originally published in the July 
20 edition of the Alligator.

It used to be that on certain 
nights, if you wanted a free drink, 
all you had to do was be a lady. 
Now, for some bars, all you 
have to do is wear high heels or shave your legs. 
With the city’s recent talks 
of discouraging ladies nights in Gainesville, a few area bars have come up with some creative ways to circumvent legal problems. 
According to city commission 
candidate Ozzy Angulo, contrary to popular belief ladies nights in Gainesville are not illegal.
While the Gainesville Office 
of Equal Opportunity is fielding complaints related to discrimi-nation regarding ladies nights around town, law enforcement officers are not banging down 
bar doors trying to shut anything 
down. Under current Gainesville codes, if someone were to com-plain that he or she felt discrimi-nated against because a local bar held a ladies night, then the Office of Equal Opportunity would in-vestigate that bar. 
Although the threat of com-
plaint is remote, some bars aren’t taking chances. Lux Bar, 211 W University Ave., has done away with its ladies night promotion 
and switched to new promotions, 
like their high-heels night.
Many of the bars that have 
changed their promotions are do-ing so because they don’t want to deal with the hassles of possible complaints and subsequent inves-tigations, Angulo said.
Lux owner Steve Nichtberger, 
like other local bar owners, has not heard any complaints about 
ladies nights in Gainesville. 
“I’ve never heard of a guy 
complain about ladies night and 
feeling discriminated against,” he said. “Usually they’re happy they don’t have to buy the drinks.”
Other bars, such as Mars Bar 
and Laser Tag, haven’t changed anything at all. Although they are 
opening themselves up to the pos-
sibility of investigation, they are still offering ladies night promo-tions on Thursdays.
Mars owner Melissa Del Valle 
said police stopped by her estab-lishment to ask if she was aware that ladies nights could be a viola-tion of the city’s ordinance code. 
“Everyone keeps talking about 
it,” Del Valle said. “I hear that Midtown bars are telling them ‘Oh don’t worry guys. We’re not doing ladies night,’ but it really isn’t illegal, so I don’t know what all the fuss is.”
Angulo said he thinks these 
promotions are opening the door to absurdity.
“At the end of the day, it’s not 
going to change anything,” he said. “It’s going to create a little bit more confusion and rowdiness.” 
Guys seeking out a free drink 
may take advantage of the new promotions, stopping in at bars, flashing their shaved legs and walking around in high heels, An-
gulo said. 
UF student Chris Brown agrees 
with Angulo, though he won’t be 
one of those guys. 
“I definitely would not shave 
my legs or wear heels to get a drink,” he said, “because that stuff does not go away. There’s gonna be pictures on Facebook or shit 
like that, and your reputation will 
always be as the guy that wears high heels for free drinks.”Gainesville bars skirt restrictions

UF students have a new option to consider while buying 
textbooks. 
Students can now rent their textbooks through a new text-
book deferment program, which allows financial aid to be used 
for books before the money is disbursed to the student. 
This option is available at the UF Bookstore and Welcome 
Center, the College of Veterinary Medicine Bookstore, the 
Health Sciences Center Bookstore and the Levin College of Law Bookstore. 
Students will be allowed to highlight and write 
in these rented books without being penalized, 
said Lynne Vaughan, director of UF bookstores. 
If students don’t return their books, the books are dam-
aged, or the books are returned late, students will be penalized, 
Vaughan said. A book not returned will result in a fee of 75 
percent of what the book would cost new. 
Students who want to use the program must create a rental 
profile on rentatext.com, Vaughan said. When students go to the bookstore to rent, all of their information is already in the system.
Not all books will be available for rent, said Jerry Meriweth-
er, assistant director of business services division of UF. He said there are about 1,000 titles available to rent at the moment. UF launches book

Internet hasn’t killed the video store. At 
least, not yet.
Gainesville still has four locations where 
people can rent movies the old-fashioned 
way. Two Blockbuster stores, Video Rodeo 
and newcomer, Go Video are the town’s survi-
vors of the ongoing struggle between physical stores, video kiosks like Redbox and the popu-lar online retailer, Netflix.
“It’s not that there’s not a demand for a 
video store, it’s that there’s not enough of a demand to charge $4 or $5 a rental and all the costs that go along with having your own store,” said Patrick Daniel, co-owner of Go 
Video and former employee of Hollywood 
Video. “There’s no way it could work on a national scale. There’s just too much money needed and not enough coming in.”
The two Gainesville Blockbuster stores are 
managing to stay afloat in the new market be-cause they are franchises, meaning they are locally owned and operated. Instead of being corporate stores, the stores pay a franchise fee 
to have the Blockbuster logo and services. This 
gives them the freedom to get creative to com-pete in tough times.Blockbuster general manager Andy Cohen, 
who owns both Gainesville locations, said the “Wacky Wednesday” promotion, which al-lows people to rent any three movies in the store for $5.55, has turned Wednesday from his slowest night into one of his best. 
Cohen said he is confident that his stores 
will remain profitable enough to stay open for at least the next two or three years.
“There’s always going to be a want on the 
customer’s behalf for a physical place where they can go and browse for movies,” he said.
Employees at both Go Video and Video Ro-
deo said they believe the stores will be around for the foreseeable future, as well. Video Rodeo has earned the reputation as a specialty store that carries independent and local movies, but Travis Mitchell, an employee at the store, said that they have all kinds of films at the store.
“It’s everything,” he said. “We’ve got the 
‘Hot Tub Time Machine,’ we’ve got ‘Shutter Island.’ We just don’t exclusively carry the big hits.”
“We try to make the browsing experience 
an important one,” Mitchell said. “It’s prob-ably our greatest asset.”
Go Video, a video-rental kiosk located in-
side the Chevron station at Hunter’s Cross-
ing on Northwest 43rd Street, was started by two of Hollywood Video’s former employees. 
The store’s business model is based off that of 
Redbox. It charges credit cards by-the-day for 
unlimited amounts of time, as opposed to set-ting due dates.
Daniel said that his store offers the conve-
nience of Redbox, but also has a film library and people to help recommend movies. “We’re located in a place that people al-
ready go – a gas station,” he said. 
Daniel said that the most important quality 
of video stores is the ability of its employees to help customers find movies they’ll like.
“We’re human beings and movies are art,” 
he said. “And art should only be recommend-ed to human beings by other human beings.”Video stores hang on tightMONDAY, AUGUST 23, 2010 � ALLIGATOR, 23

from Satchel’s Pizza in May. The restaurant’s bank won’t compen-sate.
Satchel Raye, owner of the res-
taurant, said it’s not the counter-feiters that irk him, but the bank.
“We feel the bank did us 
wrong,” he said. “We feel like a victim of Compass Bank more than the check fraud.”
The checks were created be-
cause the business’ mail, includ-ing checks, was being stolen out of the mailbox. Raye said the counterfeiters used high-tech equipment to make fake pay-checks. Those checks were then cashed at Compass Bank loca-tions around Gainesville.
Five checks were for $1,356 
and one was for $2,356. Raye said Satchel’s doesn’t often give 
payroll checks that high, and he 
thinks the bank should have seen 
that all six checks were cashed on the same day.
The restaurant pays its em-
ployees about $35,000 every two 
weeks, so Raye had to be careful 
with money to make sure his res-taurant could stay afloat.
He said if $6,000 more had 
been stolen, then the business 
would’ve struggled to make ends 
meet.
The bank, he said, reimbursed 
the money and put it in his ac-
count, but the next day, it took 
the money back.
Raye said the bank’s reasoning 
was that it didn’t need to refund 
him because he used a stamp sig-
nature on his checks – something 
he said the bank suggested.Satchel’s owner

The Jehovah’s Witnesses are knocking on 
Gainesville’s door this weekend.
From Friday through Sunday, Jehovah’s 
Witnesses will be walking through the doors 
of the O’Connell Center, where they will hold their second weekend-long convention of the summer.
Their last conference, held over Indepen-
dence Day weekend, filled about 6,000 seats in the O’Connell Center on each of its three days, according to Tony Fowler, a convention spokesman.
Attendees will be coming from Florida, 
Georgia and Alabama, according to O’Connell Center assistant director David Lucier.
The conventions are for the purpose of Bi-
ble instruction, and there will be a number of speakers and interactive presentations with a focused message, Fowler said.
The verse they will be focusing on is James 
4:8, which reads in the New World Transla-tion, “Draw close to God, and he will draw closer to you.”
During the speeches, there will be skits, 
demonstrations and staged interviews with people relating personal experiences, he said.On Saturday, there will also be a baptism 
ceremony, he said.
“There’s a focus on ways of strengthening 
one’s attachment to God and being able to see how we can strengthen our spirituality; to really handle the challenges and stresses we have to face,” he said.
The highlight of the weekend will be on 
Sunday, when performers will put on a full-costume drama that will portray an account 
from the destruction of Jerusalem in the first 
century.
“It’s all going to revolve around a variety of 
Bible topics and Bible subjects really designed to edify one’s spirituality,” he said.Gainesville hosts Jehovah’s Witness conference

Shands at UF will be forced to 
close its doors to some of its poorer 
patients.
Because the Florida Legislature’s 
special session was adjourned be-
fore it reviewed a re-installation of $9.7 million in the hospital’s 
budget, Shands will have to refuse 
medical care to non-emergency pa-tients from outside of its primary service area who are uninsured or 
under-insured.
This decision will take effect 
within before the end of August. 
As a teaching hospital, Shands 
accepts patients from all 67 Florida counties.
With the lack of funding, it will 
focus on the 13 Florida counties that fall under its primary area of service.
“We are forced to limit charity 
care,” Shands spokeswoman Kim 
Rose said. 
“Emergency patients we will sta-
bilize, but if there are services clos-er to their home equivalent to ours, 
we will redirect them there.”
Gov. Charlie 
Crist cut the $9.7 million from the hospital’s budget 
back in May. 
“It is both dev-
astating and per-
plexing to us given that the gover-nor recommended this funding as part of his budget and approved 
it in his previous three plans,” 
said Tim Goldfarb, CEO of Shands HealthCare, in a news release that was posted on the Shands at UF 
website.Shands slashes access

Ever since Mellow Mushroom closed its 
doors in October, the restaurant space just 
east of the UF campus has been vacant.
Not anymore.Nearly a year later, a new tenant will oc-
cupy the 3,400-square-foot building at 1209 W. University Ave., when Anthony’s Wood Fired Pizza opens in mid-August. 
“We know who are customers are,” said 
William Gray, a restaurant manager. “We are, 100 percent, a school-oriented restau-rant.”
Anthony’s will serve food until 4 a.m., 
providing bargoers a reasonably priced, 
late-night option to “settle you down,” 
Gray said.
Besides pizza, Anthony’s will also serve 
wings, fajitas, lasagna, burgers and an ar-ray of appetizers including a concoction called “Gator Bites.” 
The Gator Bites, with a spicy kick from 
fresh jalapeno peppers, will be the restau-rant’s claim to fame, he said. 
“But four or five of them can be danger-
ous,” he joked. “We might have to have people sign a waiver.”
A full vegetarian menu is also in the 
works, he said.
The restaurant will use wood-burning 
ovens to cook nearly every item on the menu. It will also serve a variety of import-ed, local and microbrew beers, he said. 
 “We want as many [beers] as we can get 
our hands on,” he said. 
The restaurant will also feature a chalk-
board menu with daily specials.
While specific prices 
have yet to be set, Gray said there will not be any $12 burgers like he saw at another Gainesville es-
tablishment. 
“What’s up with that?” he asked. “Noth-
ing is cheap these days, but it doesn’t have to be overpriced either.”
Before Anthony’s signed the lease, the 
property attracted plenty of potential cli-ents, said Jamie Kennedy, the commercial real estate agent who was assigned to the lot, which is less than 500 feet from the UF campus.New pizza place to replace

A gray swastika spray-painted 
on a UF fraternity house last year 
made national news this summer when the Anti-Defamation League released its 2009 Audit of Anti-Se-
mitic Incidents.
The league listed the UF inci-
dent alongside other acts of van-
dalism around the country, in-cluding rocks thrown through a synagogue’s window, KKK graffiti discovered in a synagogue’s park-ing lot after Passover and a burn-ing cross placed inside a Jewish 
education center.
Members of the traditionally 
Jewish fraternity Alpha Epsilon Pi 
discovered the swastika on April 2, 2009 and reported the incident to University Police on April 5, ac-
cording to Alligator archives. At 
nearly 8,000 Jewish students, UF has one the highest Jewish enroll-ment rates in the nation, according to UF Hillel.
The report, released on July 27, 
found that the number of anti-Se-mitic incidents in 2009 remained at a “sustained and troubling” level 
for both the United States and Florida, even with the total number incidents 
decreasing from 1,352 to 1,211.
The audit separates acts of anti-
Semitism into three categories: physical assaults, vandalism and harassment.
Florida had a total of 90 inci-
dents in 2009, down from 122 last year. There were 63 cases of harass-ment, 24 cases of vandalism and 3 physical assaults, according to the audit. The League also found an in-crease in anti-Semitism online.Frat swastika citedUNIveRsIty meDIcINe

Shands at UF was ranked in the top 50 in eight 
adult specialties by U.S. News & World Report’s 
2010-2011 edition of America’s Best Hospitals.
The rankings, announced publicly on July 15, 
analyzed 4,852 hospitals in 16 specialties. Each 
hospital was ranked in the four areas of reputation, 
death rate, patient safety and care-related factors such as nursing and patient services. 
Shands was one of 152 hospitals out of the 4,852 
surveyed that performed well enough to rank among the top 50 in any of the specialties. 
Shands was the highest-ranked Florida hospital 
in four specialties. 
It ranked 32nd nationally in heart and heart sur-
gery, 40th in kidney disorders, 29th in pulmonol-ogy and 25th in urology. 
Shands also ranked 29th nationally in cancer, 
39th in neurology and neurosurgery, 39th  in geri-atrics and 41st in gastroenterology.
Shands was the only Florida hospital ranked in 
pulmonology, and, for the third consecutive year, the state’s highest-ranked hospital in urology, the surgical specialty treating diseases and disorders 
of the urinary tracts of male and females and the reproductive system of males.
Dr. Johannes Vieweg, UF department of urol-
ogy chairman, said he owes much of the success in 
the survey to the recruitment of new faculty. 
Vieweg said his department would like to reach 
out and open up to more areas, extending practices beyond the Gainesville area to become a provider throughout the state and even the country. He said he sees patients visiting from other states for the quality care Shands offers.
“Patients really seek out the top-ranked pro-
grams,” Vieweg said. “I think this will positively reflect on Shands.” 
Dr. Carmen Allegra, chief of the division of 
hematology and oncology for the department of medicine, said he owed part of his department’s recognition to excellent faculty as well.
“We’ve had a tremendous number of new fac-
ulty join us within the last year or two,” Allegra said. ”Many of them have national and interna-
tional reputations.”Shands ranked among best

ranked programs. I think this will

The Flour Pot Bakery is battling hunger one 
cookie at a time.
The bakery, located in the Tioga Town Cen-
ter in Gainesville, launched a three-month Sum-
mer of Edible Goodness program on June 1, in 
which the owners agree to donate a school meal 
to a hungry child in a developing nation for ev-ery food item the store sells.
“We’re doing directly one for one,” said 
Melissa Austin, 22, partial owner of the bakery. “How many customers come in is how many meals we’re giving.”
After research, the bakery’s owners chose 
to donate the money raised from selling baked 
goods to the United Nations’ Fill the Cup Cam-
paign. Bakery employees hand out tickets to customers and keep half of the ticket to track the number of food items sold.
“We want to give people a step up,” Austin said. “Studies show that kids are more willing 
to go to school if they know they’re going to get 
a meal.”
In February, Austin assumed ownership of 
the store alongside her fiancé, Bryan Judah, 25, and his mother, Sally Judah. Judah’s interest in social entrepreneurship and Austin’s family background in baking encouraged the family to try running the business, Austin said.
“Being a businessman, [Judah] doesn’t want 
to neglect that need to help too,” she said.
June 1 also marked the one-year anniversary 
of the death of Julian Nobles, Judah’s grandfa-ther, whose favorite pastime was finding fresh produce for friends, family and even strangers, she said. Austin said the Edible Goodness pro-gram was made in honor of him.
“He would actually go door to door to pass 
out local produce to friends,” she said. “We nev-
er saw him without a basket of potatoes or some-
thing. He just loved making people happy.”
The bakery is open from 7 a.m. to 7:30 p.m., 
Monday through Friday, and from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Saturday.Bakery teams up with UN

Senators voted against a bill that 
would limit funds given to Student Government officials for meals and 
cell phone bills during an Aug. 3 meeting.
Members of the Student Alliance 
party authored the Student Govern-ment Fiscal Responsibility Act, that would have, if passed, put a cap on 
the money given to SG officials for 
cell phone usage and meal cards.
According to the bill, the Stu-
dent Body President, Vice President 
and Treasurer each receive between $1,200 and $1,500 a year for cell 
phone usage and up to $3,000 for meal cards. 
All of this money comes from the 
SG budget,  
This money, combined with the 
money given to other SG officials, 
costs SG more 
than $16,000 per 
year. This num-
ber excludes 
salaries and travel funding, accord-
ing to the bill.
In the bill, the Student Alliance 
party proposed giving the officials 
only $65 a month for their cell phone bills, and $500 a year toward their 
meal cards, which can be used at any Gator Dining location.
Jonathan Ossip, Senate leader 
for the Student Alliance party, said he does not want to see their com-pensations cut completely, nor is he 
against them receiving a salary, but 
he does not think so much money 
for SG officials should be taken from 
the student body when the funds could be used for something else.
Ben Meyers, who represents the 
Unite Party, said the money is given to these officials because they cannot have a part-time job and serve in SG at the same time. 
He said these members of SG 
spend most of their time in the Re-itz Union, so they typically eat there, and they spend a lot of time on the 
phone working with people such as 
the SG lobbyists in Tallahassee. 
“These so-called perks are nec-
essary to help them do their jobs,” 
Meyers said. “We’re lucky that we still even have leaders that are will-
ing to serve.”SG decides not to limit funds for officials’ phones, food

More than 2,000 years ago, Romans 
raced wooden chariots around the track 
at Circus Maximus for sport. 
July 30 at the Reitz Union Ballroom, the 
past was resurrected, albeit on a smaller 
scale, and with robots.
About 120 engineering freshmen, 
grouped in 30 teams of four or five, raced 
shoe-box sized chariots made of LEGO s that they had been building and pro-gramming as part of AGN 1935, an intro-duction course given over summer.
While the performance of the robots 
was not part of the final grade, there was a 
prize for the winner, as well as small door 
prizes for each bracket winner and super-latives like best design, said Dan Dickrell of the UF department of mechanical and aerospace engineering.
They will, however, be graded on a 
written summary about the building and programming process.“We want it to be fun, but we also want 
them to take it seriously,” Dickrell said.
In the past, the class has always ended 
with a building assignment, but “nothing to this magnitude of coolness,” he said.
According to Dickrell, it’s actually in 
the rules that each chariot must be topped with a LEGO man, and if he gets knocked off, just as in real chariot races, he’s dead, and the team is disqualified.
J. T. Anderson, a chemical engineering 
major, has spent about 10 hours on his chariot, and said the experience has con-firmed he’s on the right track.
“This has kind of showed us that engi-
neers are faced with a problem, and you need to figure out the best way to solve it,” he said. “It’s a lot of work but a lot of fun at the same time.”MONDAY, AUGUST 23, 2010 � ALLIGATOR, 27

The Florida Legislature is kicking bicy-
cles to the curb.
A bill signed by Gov. Charlie Crist will 
force cyclists to ride in bike lanes if one is 
available after Sept. 1.
A section of the 81-page bill will amend 
the current law, which states bikes must 
ride as close to the edge of the road as prac-tical, to say that if a bike lane is present then cyclists must stay in the bike lane.
Bicycle advocacy groups, such as Flor-
ida Bicycle Association and Green Mobile Network, oppose the bill because it takes power away from cyclists.
The bill contains exceptions to the law. 
For example, if an animal runs in front of a cyclist, then the person can swerve out of the way. 
The executive director of Florida Bicycle 
Association, Laura Hallam, said she thinks 
the bill will hurt bike safety.
“What’s going to happen is it’s just go-
ing to make things so much more confus-
ing over whether a bicyclist is in the right 
place,” she said. “Whereas, it would be 
much better for bicyclists to make their 
own judgment on where the safest place on the roadways is.”
Tui Popenoe, a computer science and 
business administration junior who works 
at the Student Government Bike Repair, 
said the bill makes a reasonable request.“If the bike lane is there, then bikes 
should ride in it,” he said. “If it’s not there, 
then the law doesn’t change anything.”
The main problem with the new law, 
said Gainesville lawyer Cherie Fine, is that 
too much is left up to interpretation. She 
said she hopes Gainesville 
will interpret the law to 
mean that cyclists should 
ride in bike lanes only if 
it’s safe to do so.
One problem that can 
arise, she said, is if courts 
use the law as an excuse to give tickets to cyclists. She 
fears that “this could make cyclists second-class citizens.”
There are different types of cyclists, ac-
cording to Dekova Batey, the program co-ordinator for the City of Gainesville’s Bicy-
cle/Pedestrian Program. For more relaxed 
cyclists, using a sidewalk is more appropri-
ate since they don’t need the speed of the road. However, for people who commute by bicycle, they are more likely to need the 
speed of a bike lane.
Cyclists on the road should operate like 
motor vehicles, while cyclists on sidewalks 
should operate like pedestrians, he said.
Another portion of the bill, which Hal-
lam said Mothers Against Drunk Driving 
supports, changes driving under the influ-
ence restrictions.
Previously, people receiving a fourth 
DUI conviction would permanently lose 
their licenses. Under the bill, they can re-
gain their license by connecting their cars’ 
ignitions to alcohol-testing devices.
This option makes sure the government 
is tracking drivers with a history of driving 
under the influence, Hallam said.New state law forces cyclists to stick to bike lines

Graffiti isn’t a black-and-white 
issue.
Its legality, artistic merit and 
permanence are debated. But in 
Gainesville, it’s still vandalism.
On July 21, it took Chris Arters, 
a Physical Plant Division employ-ee, about 30 minutes to clean graf-fiti off the potato-shaped rock in Turlington Plaza, according to 
Wayne Wainwright, UF facilities 
department manager.
According to Wainwright, 
graffiti shows up every week on campus during the summer. Dur-
ing the fall, it’s every few days.
Sometimes, 
it takes a whole 
day to remove the graffiti.
The Southwest 34th Street wall, 
the 13th Street pedestrian tunnel and Turlington Plaza are three of Gainesville’s biggest graffiti hot 
spots.
While technically illegal, no 
one has been arrested for vandal-
izing any of those three places in 
recent months.
About once or twice a year, 
students are disciplined for graf-
fiti, said Capt. Jeff Holcomb of the University Police Department.
The wall on 34th Street is 
owned by the Florida Department of Transportation, and it is illegal 
to paint graffiti there, according 
to Gina Busscher, a department spokeswoman.
“We don’t have enforcement 
powers,” she said. “We rely on local police, and it has not, in the past, been a high priority for the police to enforce the vandalism.”
The Department of Transpor-
tation understands police officers focus on issues that are more seri-ous, she said. 
Gainesville Police Department 
spokeswoman Cpl. Tscharna Senn said she doesn’t think anyone has ever been arrested for vandalizing 
the wall.
The wall serves as a “commu-
nity bulletin board,” said Rich-
ard Heipp, interim director of the 
School of Art and Art History at 
UF.
Mickie MacKenzie, executive 
director of Keep Alachua County Beautiful, said the organization 
tries to paint over obscenities. 
Graffiti, she said, is usually an eyesore and a symbol of crime.
The pedestrian tunnel under 
13th Street mostly serves as an artistic outlet for students, and it differs from more vulgar graffiti 
found elsewhere, Holcomb said.
“It’s not even good tagging,” 
he said.
But Holcomb said there’s some 
good art on the 34th Street wall, 
including the memorial to the five UF students murdered in the fall of 1990. Adam Tritt, a 45-year-old writer and therapist in Palm Bay, 
painted the memorial in Septem-
ber 1990.
“I knew the community was 
suffering, and I did something 
about it,” Tritt said.
But he said it’s “stark-raving crazy” that the memorial is still around 20 years later.
“It was going to be extremely 
temporary because that’s the na-
ture of the wall, which is why that 
center panel ruins the concept of 
the wall.”
Alachua County Sheriff Sadie 
Darnell, then a Gainesville Police captain, maintained the wall until 
2000. Now, UF’s Interfraternity 
Council maintains the memorial, said Sean Smith, the council’s president.
For graffiti artists, Gainesville’s 
not the best place to tag, one artist said. The graffiti artist, who goes by “Brown,” started learning the art of graffiti at the wall on 34th 
Street about three years ago.
He said it’s frustrating that 
what he paints on the wall gets 
painted over. Generally, he said, it 
costs him about $15 for each piece 
he paints. He said many people have a misconception that graf-fiti crews are the same as gangs because of gang tags, but he said 
the gang tags aren’t true graffiti 
because they mostly just mark ter-ritory.
But the Norman Tunnel offers 
first-time graffiti artists an oppor-tunity to experiment.
Tuesday night, three high 
school seniors who are at UF for a summer science camp spray 
painted their first tags.
“It’s something we wanted 
to leave behind,” he said. “Now 
we’re a part of history.”MONDAY, AUGUST 23, 2010 � ALLIGATOR, 29

POLL RESULTS TEEING OFF WITH TYLER JETT UF FOOTBALL� HE SPENT THE LAST 
THREE SEASONS BEHIND 
TEBOW.
By KYLE MAISTRI
Alligator Staff Writer
kmaistri@alligator.org
The new face of Florida foot-
ball is mustachioed. 
Redshirt junior quarterback 
John Brantley has fielded pre-
season questions from reporters ranging from his new favorite targets to the new growth above 
his upper lip. 
“He needs to shave it,” quar-
terbacks coach Scot Loeffler said. 
“He will. Don’t worry.”
Brantley disagrees. “He doesn’t know what he’s 
talking about,” Brantley said.
While the quarterback and his 
coach continue to grapple with the presentation of the program’s new face, there is one thing ev-eryone can get excited about: 
Brantley’s ability to throw the 
ball from the pocket. 
His predecessor spent much of 
his time bowling over linebackers and stiff arming safeties, but his teammates know that won’t be Brantley’s game. And that’s just fine with them. 
“Brantley looks great throw-
ing the ball,” running back Em-manuel Moody said.  We feel he’s a pure passer, and he’s going to do great this year,” 
Tim Tebow ran the ball 217 
times a season ago and locked into departed pass-catching op-tions Aaron Hernandez and Ri-ley Cooper, who combined to ac-
count for 55 percent of the team’s 
receiving yardage. Brantley is expected to carry 
the ball far less often and be more 
indiscriminate with who is on the 
receiving end of his passes. 
“I have a really good chem-
istry with all of them, really,” 
Brantley said.  “I’ve had a chance 
to throw to all of them quite a bit. They all can be playmakers in my eyes. They’re all fast and they all 
can catch.”
Brantley spent three seasons 
developing a rhythm with many 
of the receivers who will be count-
ed on to step up and produce for 
the first time this season. The offense is expected to be 
more pass heavy than it has been 
in seasons past, but the only re-
ceiver or tight end on the roster with more than 14 career recep-tions is Deonte Thompson. Brant-
ley will be counted on to turn the 
collective potential of the wide receivers into collective produc-tion. 
Loeffler has been impressed 
with his first-year starter’s lead-ership, which he said started when Tebow walked off the field for the last time after the Sugar 
Bowl. 
“It’s been an everyday process 
for him; it doesn’t happen over 
night,” Loeffler said. “You got to first learn to lead by example, 
and then you find the right time 
to open your mouth and find the right time to keep your mouth closed, but it all starts with lead-
ing by example. I think he’s done 
a helluva job with that.”
If leading the team through 
training camp was Brantley’s first task as the starting quarterback, 
leading the team through a rig-
orous Southeastern Conference schedule will be his next.
And that’s something he’s been 
preparing for since he signed his letter of intent in 2007. 
“I’m not sure if I was ready 
or not,” Brantley said of starting right away. “I would say I wasn’t 
ready. I’m ready now.”

UF quarterback John Brantley is taking over for former Heisman Trophy winner Tim Tebow this season.  
Brantley is more of a pocket passer, and the offense is expected to change to accommodate his style.

Unlike Friday night, the Gators didn’t 
need any magic. 
Finishing some well-timed second-half 
opportunities, No.11 Florida defeated 
No.25 Central Florida 2-0 Sunday evening 
at UCF’s Track and Soccer Complex.
The Gators (2-0-0) dominated the early 
moments of the second half, scoring two 
goals within six minutes of each other, both by junior attacker Tahnai Annis. 
In the 48th minute, a defensive error 
turned into a fortuitous opportunity as Annis collected a miss-cleared header just outside the six-yard box and ripped a shot 
near post. 
The goal ended the Gators drought of 
missed chances. In the first half, Florida 
had multiple shots but struggled either keeping the ball on frame or maintaining possession despite UCF being content to play on its heels. The Gators seemed frus-trated in the first half, failing to take the lead. 
At halftime, coach Becky Burleigh gave 
her team words of encouragement, telling them to keep pushing forward. “I told them to take it to them,” she 
said. “They just kept dropping deeper and deeper…Annis came through.”
Central Florida (0-0-1), the defending 
Conference USA Champions, gave Florida several scares in the first half, but sopho-more defensive anchor Kathryn William-
son came up huge with several crucial 
challenges.  
“She is such a strong 
defender,” goalkeeper Ka-
tie Fraine said. “She saved us a couple of times. That one block she had was just phenomenal. She chased a girl down from 30 yards 
and came in with a great 
clean tackle.”
The Gators second goal 
(52nd minute) came on a counter attack and was beautifully set up by sophomore Erika Tymrak. Streaking down the middle of the pitch, Tymrak received a ball from sophomore captain McKenzie Barney and slipped a pass to Annis, who was making 
a diagonal run across from the left and 
scored with a sliding finish. 
“Erika played in a great straight ball be-
cause I was already making the run,” An-nis said. “I knew that if I tried to take an-other touch on it, that wouldn’t work out because the defender was right on me.” 
The two goals were the 16th and 17th 
goals of Annis’ career at UF.
The win moved the Gators to 2-0 on 
the young season as Florida defeated the 
Miami Hurricanes 2-1 in overtime Friday 
night in its home opener. 
Freshman sensation Taylor Travis, a 
U.S. national team pool player, had a phe-nomenal debut, scoring the golden goal in the 107th minute of the second overtime period. 
Late in extra time, the Gators pushed 
hard for a goal and had a beautiful combi-
nation play between sophomore midfield-
er Holly King, Barney and Travis. King whipped the ball into the box from the right sideline and Barney, who scored the Gators first goal of the season, one-timed a pass to Travis, who was making a diago-nal run across and blasted the shot into the back left corner. 
“Not a bad debut for a freshman,” Bur-
leigh said. “It’s big that a freshman did that. She finished it with good composure. It was really well executed all the way around.”   UF downs UCF with second-half goals

While You Were Away ...
Agent Allegations:  It was the Age of the Agents this summer, 
as several big-time college football programs dealt with allega-
tions that players accepted money from agents. Florida’s Maurkice Pouncey, now with the NFL’s Pittsburgh Steelers, was accused of taking $100,000, but he turned over financial records and called the claims “absolutely ridiculous.” Nothing has been proven.
Tyus Decides to Stay: After testing the NBA Draft waters, UF for-ward Alex Tyus chose to return for his senior season. His presence means 
the Gators will bring back their top five scorers from last year, and Tyus, who tied for the team lead in rebounds per game in 2009-10, will be part of an experienced frontcourt along with fellow seniors Vernon Macklin and Chandler Parsons.
 Gators Eliminated From CWS: UF entered the College World Series as the second highest 
seeded team in the tournament, but it was the first squad eliminated. The Gators opened up the 
CWS with an 11-3 loss to UCLA and then followed it up with an 8-5 defeat at the hands of FSU — knocking them out of the tourney. The team’s youth and inexperience was evident in Omaha, Neb., 
where it started a freshman pitcher in its elimination game against the Seminoles.

UF VOLLEYBALL
By GREG LUCA
Alligator Writer 
gluca@alligator.org
 
When a team features just one senior in the 
final match of its campaign, it usually comes 
back the next year with many of the same faces and can pick up right where it left off. 
But for the 2010 Florida volleyball team, the 
opposite is true. 
Thanks to an eventful transfer season, the 
Gators lost a pair of significant contributors from a young 2009 team, as Brynja Rodgers and Colleen Ward decided to take their talents elsewhere. 
In an attempt to fill the void left by these 
departures, UF coach Mary Wise brought in 
a trio of transfers of her own. They expect to 
have an immediate impact once the season begins.
“We just have to accept that maybe (Rod-
gers and Ward) felt they weren’t a fit for our program,” junior Kristy Jaeckel said. “We have people coming in that are extremely dedicated to the program and who are excited to be here, and those are the kind of people that we want 
here in our gym.”
The most notable of these transfers is junior 
outside hitter Stephanie Ferrell, who in was a second-team All-Western Athletic Conference 
performer for a Hawaii squad that made it all the way to the Final Four before falling to un-defeated Penn State in 2009.
Ferrell, who left Hawaii after a dispute with 
her former coach, opted to make the move to Florida due to the level of competition in the Southeastern Conference, the school’s high national standing and Wise’s reputation.
Wise, like many other coaches throughout 
college volleyball, was first exposed to Ferrell while watching her play in the Final Four.
“I saw her play in the semifinals last year in 
Tampa where she went off for six kills in the 
first set, and I thought that wasn’t too shabby,” 
Wise said. “It took a while for all of the stars to line up for the transfer to happen and for her to get into the University of Florida, and the day she arrived I almost couldn’t believe it. I almost had to pinch myself.”
Ferrell expects her Final Four experience 
and leadership to be just as valuable to the team as her high-octane and hard-hitting style 
of play, which has already caught the atten-
tion of junior Kelly Murphy. 
“Stephanie really brings a lot of energy,” 
Murphy said. “She plays harder than anyone I’ve seen in a long time, and I think that’s go-ing to help us a lot.”’While Ferrell will play a major role in re-
placing Ward’s 3.09 kills per set, the burden will not fall on her alone. The Gators also brought in junior outside hitter Cinthya Ro-berto from Blinn (Texas) Junior College to 
lighten the load. 
Roberto enters UF as the only two-time 
first-team All-American in Blinn’s history. 
She also won a national championship there in 2008.
“Being with that team gave me a lot of ex-
perience and playing time in important situations,” Roberto said. “I feel more 
prepared and ready for a 
great season ahead with the Gators.”
While Roberto already 
understands what it’s like to play for a winning team in high-pressure condi-
tions, the level of competition she faces on a week-to-week basis at Florida figures to be 
superior to anything she saw in junior college. 
Still, the only junior college player the 
Gators have ever brought in over the course 
of Wise’s 19-year tenure is confident she will make a smooth transition. 
“It’s going to be really intense and every-thing is going to be new, but with the help of my teammates and my new coaches every-thing is going to be fine,” Roberto said. 
Although she will be playing at the outside 
hitter spot, her most notable contributions will 
likely be on defense and in service reception.
“Cinthya is a very good back row player,” 
Murphy said. “She has great ball control, and 
that’s something we really needed to work on.”
Also providing extra defensive support for 
the Gators will be transfer Tangerine Wiggs. She doesn’t bring as much experience as the other two transfers, but Wise expects her 
to help the team with her ability to rack up 
blocks.
She appeared in just 10 sets for Washing-
ton State in 2009 and comes in as an opposite hitter.
The 6-foot-2 sophomore adds some size to 
a relatively small squad, and hopes to make an immediate contribution wherever she can. 
“I’m hoping to make an impact in blocking 
as well as on the offensive side,” Wiggs said. “Really everyone is fitting into a great role here, and whatever impact I can make for the team, I will. Whatever role Mary would like me to take and the team wants me to be in I’ll accept.”
Busy transfer season brings Gators three new players

TAMPA — The recruiting pro-
cess came to an end for two of the 
state’s top recruits Wednesday. But 
only one of those journeys ended 
with Gainesville as the final destina-tion.
Groveland South Lake High cor-
nerback Nick Waisome and Tampa Plant High athlete James Wilder Jr. both made their college choices pub-lic Wednesday, with Waisome an-
nouncing live on ESPNU and Wild-
er revealing his decision at a press conference in the Plant auditorium.
Waisome, a four-star cornerback 
accoring to Rivals.com, committed to Florida on Wednesday night in Orlando.
On the live show, Waisome re-
moved a South Lake High hat he was 
wearing, pulled out a blue Gators 
cap and donned it as he announced his decision to the cameras.
“The place I’ll be playing my 
college football at – the University of Florida,” Waisome said on the 
broadcast.
Waisome is rated the 11th  best 
cornerback recruit in the nation by 
Rivals and runs a 4.44 40-yard dash. 
His oral commitment makes him the 
14th member of the Gators’ 2011 re-cruiting class.
It was long assumed that Wai-
some was Florida’s to lose, and many suspected he was leaning to-ward the Gators after his showing 
at the team’s annual Friday Night 
Lights camp last month.
After the camp, Waisome spoke 
of the strong bonds he built with UF’s coaches, and when he made his decision Wednesday, that was one of his deciding factors.
 “I had a great relationship with 
the coaches, some of the players,” 
Waisome said. “I like the atmo-
sphere, the school is always a fun 
place. I just liked it overall. Great school, win championships and I’m ready to play.”
Mike Farrell, the Midwest and 
Atlantic East recruiting analyst for 
Rivals, said Wednesday via his 
Twitter account that Waisome re-
minds him of current Gators fresh-
man Cody Riggs, a four-star corner-
back recruit out of Fort Lauderdale St. Thomas Aqui-nas before sign-
ing with UF. 
Farrell added he doesn’t see Wai-
some being as good as UF junior cor-
nerback Janoris Jenkins, who was a 
Parade All-American before enroll-
ing at UF. In Jenkins’ two seasons for 
the Gators, he has totaled 77 tackles, 
five interceptions and has broken up 
17 passes. 
While the Gators added a big 
piece of the recruiting puzzle with 
Waisome’s verbal, his commitment 
seemed like a consolation prize after Wilder’s decision earlier in the day.In front of a crowded Plant audi-
torium, Wilder, the No. 3 recruit in the nation according to Rivals, com-mitted to FSU.
Wilder came to the stage wearing 
a black shirt with a red vest, fueling speculation that stemmed from an AOL FanHouse report that he was going to commit to Georgia.
While Waisome didn’t waste any 
time in making his decision known, 
Wilder had fun with those in atten-
dance before revealing his inten-tions.
During a speech in which he 
thanked his coaches, teammates, family, fans, God, Wilder paused for 
a moment and reached under the 
gold-draped table he was standing 
at.
“Oh yeah, and the school I’m go-
ing to be choosing is – going to be 
told in a few moments,” Wilder said as the crowd let out a laugh.
After finishing his speech and 
pulling another pump fake on the audience, he finally reached into 
a bag under the table, pulled out a 
garnet FSU cap and gave a few tom-
ahawk chops.
“After looking and doing a lot 
more research, it came down to 
Georgia, Florida and Florida State,” 
Wilder said. “It was hard passing 
up Florida. They know how to win, 
they know how to get people to the next level.”
He notified FSU’s coaches two 
days before his commitment but re-frained from going public with the decision until Wednesday’s press conference.
“It’s a great decision, great fit and 
he’s going to get to play on the of-fensive side of the ball,” Plant coach 
Robert Weiner said.
As a junior at Plant, Wilder, who 
Weiner called a “one in a million” 
football player, played running back on offense, and defensive end and linebacker on defense. 
In 13 starts, he rushed for 1,004 
yards and 15 touchdowns on 134 
carries while tallying 136 total tack-
les, 19 sacks and 42 tackles for a 
loss. He also forced six fumbles and 
blocked six kicks en route to the 
Class 5A state title last season.
While he excelled on both sides 
of the ball, Wilder has been adamant that he wants to play running back at the college level. His father, James 
Wilder Sr., played running back in 
the NFL for 10 seasons.
“He made a grown-man decision 
today,” Wilder Sr. said.
The 6-foot-2 Wilder chose FSU 
because it was close to home, the 
coaches recruited him as a running back and because running backs coach Eddie Gran has a history of developing big, powerful backs, 
having turned nine of his former 
players into current NFL backs.
While verbal commitments are 
non-binding until a player signs his 
national letter of intent in February, 
Wilder said his mind and heart are set on FSU.
“I’m sure coaches will still be try-
ing to recruit me,” he said. “But I think this is it.”MONDAY, AUGUST 23, 2010 � ALLIGATOR, 41

� WHITSON WAS THE NO. 9 PICK IN THE MLB 
DRAFT.
By TOM GREEN
Alligator Writer
tgreen@alligator.org
Last Monday’s midnight deadline for MLB teams to 
sign draft picks came and went, and when the dust set-
tled, one draft pick decided on a college career before a 
professional one.
Karsten Whitson, the No. 9 overall pick in the 2010 
MLB Draft, went unsigned, as he was unable to agree to 
contract terms with the San Diego Padres.
Instead, Whitson, a highly touted right-handed pitch-
er out of Chipley High, will enroll at Florida to play for coach Kevin O’Sullivan and the Gators.
As a senior at Chipley, the 6-foot-4 hurler struck out 
123 batters in 55 innings of work.
His decision to go unsigned and enroll at UF adds 
even more depth to an already strong pitching staff as-sembled by O’Sullivan, who spent nine seasons as the pitching coach at Clemson before taking the head coach-
ing job at Florida in 2007.
When contacted Friday, Whitson declined to com-
ment on the failed negotiations with the Padres.
However, Whitson told the Jackson County Floridan 
last week he had remained hopeful of striking a deal with 
San Diego until Monday’s midnight signing deadline.
“It was tough,” Whitson told the Floridan. “I was 
going into the day very optimistic in hoping both sides 
would agree on a deal in the middle. I wasn’t trying to 
blow the Padres out of the water by any means. But it just didn’t work out. I’m very happy with the decision.”
According to Johnny Barbato, a UF commit and Pa-
dres signee, Whitson wasn’t satisfied with the signing 
bonus the Padres offered for the No. 9 pick — $2.1 mil-
lion. 
Whitson put a higher value on his talent than what 
the Padres were offering and decided to move on when 
the team wouldn’t budge.
“He was basically able to hold his ground,” Kent 
Whitson, Whitson’s father, told the Floridan. “The two 
sides just couldn’t get together to get it done. The reality was that, whatever Karsten’s number was, it didn’t mat-
ter. Their number was just over ($2 million), and that was 
not enough to take him away from fulfilling his dream to go to UF and try to help lead them to a national title.”
While Whitson decided to join the Gators’ roster, Bar-
bato, who was drafted in the sixth round by the Padres, signed a contract with the team prior to the deadline.
“(Playing professional baseball) has just been a 
dream,” Barbato said. “I can’t wait to start.”
Barbato, who was a right-handed pitcher at Miami 
Varela, agreed to a contract with a $1.4 million signing bonus. He said he signed the deal because it was close enough to the number he was asking — $1.5 million — and because he wasn’t looking forward to the class as-
pect of college.
As a senior at Varela, Barbato was named to the Un-
der Armour All-America Team, which is named by Base-
ball America.
“It was hard to turn down Florida,” Barbato said. “But 
at the end of the day, with all that money being thrown at me, it wasn’t that hard.”Whitson picks

Every year, Florida kicks off 
its season with the Orange and 
Blue Scrimmage. Before the match starts, coach Mary Wise introduces 
all of the players to the fans.
For some players, it is their first 
introduction. For others, it is their 
last.
“It’s kind of sad that it’s the 
last one, but we have a really good schedule this year, and I’m really excited to start my senior season,”  outside hitter Callie Rivers said. “I think we did really well. We had a lot of fans out, so it was fun to play in front of our fans, and it was nice to play in this atmosphere be-fore going out to Nebraska to play 
Iowa State.”
At Saturday’s intrasquad scrim-
mage, in which players switched 
teams throughout the match, the 
Blue team won the first three sets 
29-27, 25-16 and 25-20 while the 
Orange team took the shortened fourth set 16-14.
The Orange and Blue Scrim-
mage might be the only thing 
guaranteed to this team. An un-
proven roster will be counted on to continue Florida’s tradition of 
winning.
With senior Erin Fleming re-
placing the Southeastern Confer-
ence’s all-time digs leader, Elyse Cusack, first-year assistant coach Dave Boos installing a new de-
fense and a schedule that has the 
Gators facing 10 ranked teams, the beginning of the season can go 
many ways.
“We’ve fo-
cused a lot on 
our defense the past two weeks,” 
junior Kristy 
Jaeckel said. “It’s 
definitely a little 
more intricate defense than 
we’ve run in the past.”
Jaeckel, along with junior Kelly 
Murphy, was named to the Pre-season All-SEC Team. “Practice makes perfect,” Jaeck-
el said. “I don’t think we’re gonna be perfect when we go out and play Iowa State next week but it’s gon-
na be a progression that hopefully 
by December we’ll be a very stra-
tegic defensive team that’s tough 
to beat. That’s ultimately when we want to be at our best.”
Jaeckel led the Gators with 18 
kills Saturday, and sophomore 
transfer Tangerine Wiggs finished 
second with 15.  Murphy tallied a team-high 29 assists and Rivers 
logged 11 digs.
“The reoccurring theme with 
this group will be that it’s a work 
in progress because there are so many new systems that are being 
introduced to them, and we cer-
tainly don’t have them down yet,” 
Wise said. “We continue to get some wrong people in the wrong places, but, in time, we think we 
can be a team that will be really hard to score on.”
Although there were many 
times the crowd cheered for a div-
ing dig or a great spike, there were 
also multiple times when a ball dropped in between two players 
because of miscommunication.
“There’s nothing we can do in 
practice to simulate this game-type 
atmosphere when you’re doing it with the lights on and the fans in 
the stands,” Wise said. “It’s the 
perfect way to introduce the team 
and for us to get better. “
The 2009 season marked the 
first time Wise, entering her 20th 
season as the coach of the Gators, 
did not win the SEC Champion-
ship.Scrimmage gives fans a glimpse of 2010 Gators

A lot has changed for Jordan Reed in a 
year.
As a freshman last fall, he was buried 
on Florida’s depth chart behind quarter-
backs Tim Tebow and John Brantley. Fast forward 365 days, and he is expected to 
line up as UF’s starting tight end when 
the team opens its season against Miami (Ohio) on Sept. 4.
The 6-foot-3, 240-pound bruiser came 
to campus as a decorated quarterback with many of the same attributes that made Tebow successful. 
Rivals.com gave him four stars as a 
high school prospect and named him the 10th best dual-threat quarterback in the country.
But it wasn’t enough. 
Following a redshirt season, UF coach-
es presented Reed with the option of stick-
ing to his natural position or making the switch to tight end.
After playing both positions for most of 
the spring, the choice became obvious and he notified the coaches of his decision. 
“I was progressing faster at tight end 
than quarterback, so I thought that was a 
better fit for me,” Reed said. “I wanted to 
play faster because I knew I wasn’t going to play over [Brantley].”
The transition has been a smooth one, 
partly because Reed didn’t have to do much physically to prepare for the new position. 
“I’ve always been a big dude,” he said.And his athleticism has helped him 
with route-running and catching balls over linebackers and safeties.
The hardest part came when he was 
asked to get into a stance and block. Reed, 
who played quarterback his entire life up 
to that point, had never been asked to take on such a task.
“Blocking is pretty tough and learning 
the footwork,” he said. “It’s more of the technical part of blocking than the physi-cal part.”
However, he still takes some snaps in 
practice — just not with the intention of throwing the ball. 
Coaches have been using Reed as a 
quarterback in the wildcat package during goal line situations in an attempt to help fill the void Tebow left behind. 
Reed said he expects to be utilized in 
those situations because he has the size and strength to gain tough yards.
He ran for just six yards on one carry in 
the spring game in April. But he still was unsure about his role in the offense at that 
point. 
“He is very versatile, very multi-tal-
ented,” tight ends coach Brian White said. 
“We are going to use his skills. The ceiling 
is very high.”
Former Gators tight end Cornelius In-
gram made the same transition from quar-
terback. He now plays for the NFL’s Phila-delphia Eagles, giving Reed a role model 
to look up to.
But the way Reed is used in the offense 
will likely resemble Aaron Hernandez more 
closely than Ingram. Hernandez filled a ver-
satile role during his three seasons at Flori-da, and Reed said Hernandez provided him with pointers before he left UF for his NFL career.
“There’s a great tradition for tight ends 
here, so hopefully I fit in,” Reed said.
The Gators are hoping he does too.
Reed, who has been at the position for 
less than a year, will have some grow-ing pains along the way, but coaches are 
amazed at how quickly he has adapted to 
the switch.
“He’s not totally ready, but he’ll be 
there,” White said. “He has come a long way from somebody that couldn’t even get into a stance to someone that’s looking like 
a [Southeastern Conference] tight end.”MONDAY, AUGUST 23, 2010 � ALLIGATOR, 43

Senior Erin Fleming will take over for the SEC’s all--time 
digs leader, Elyse Cusack, at the libero position.
By MATT RUBIN
Alligator Writer
 
The UF football team isn’t the only 
squad trying to replace a Southeast-
ern Conference star. As junior John Brantley takes the reins from Tim 
Tebow, the Florida volleyball team 
will have to replace a leader of its own.
The Gators will enter the 2010 
season without Elyse Cusack, who graduated as the best libero in both school and conference history.
Cusack is the SEC’s all-time leader 
in digs (2,138) and has won the most SEC Defensive Player of the Week awards (13). She leaves a large void in the center of UF’s formation.
Enter senior libero Erin Fleming 
— the Brantley to Cusack’s Tebow.
“Elyse was always a great libero,” 
Fleming said. “I learned a lot watch-
ing her my first three years on the 
team.  She told me to keep commu-nicating, work hard during practice and help the team in every way pos-sible.”
After beginning her career as a 
walk-on and serving as a back-line substitute, Fleming is looking for-ward to her first season as a starter.
“In college athletics, it’s so much 
about taking advantage when the op-portunity presents itself,” UF coach 
Mary Wise said. “Elyse graduates, 
the opportunity is there and Erin had as good a spring semester as we’ve ever seen in a player in terms of how 
hard she worked, how much better 
she got — carried that all the way through the summer.
“She’s going to leave here as our 
starting libero, a key player on our team. She’ll provide huge leader-ship.”
As if replacing Cusack wasn’t 
hard enough, Fleming also has to 
juggle the pressure of providing se-
nior leadership and learning a new position.
“It’s a new position for me,” Flem-
ing said. “The past three years, I’ve been playing middle back and right 
back, but learning from Elyse was 
really important to me. Some things, like remembering not to use your hands in front of the 10-foot line, have all been new to me. My team 
has been great and patient, and coach 
Wise has done a great job teaching me.”
One reason for Fleming’s success 
leading up to the season has been the arrival of assistant coach Dave Boos. 
Boos enters his first season with 
the Gators after serving as the head coach at Ball State the past three years. 
Prior to that, he was on the coaching 
staff at Minnesota, which defeated the Gators in the 2006 NCAA Tour-nament behind Boos’ defense.
“The new system that Dave put in 
for us helped out basically everyone on the team, including myself and all of the blockers,” Fleming said. “It’s a big step in making me look good, 
but my teammates are very helpful 
with my success. Anything I can do to help my team and any advice I can give as a leader is all part of working together as a unit.”
The outcome of the Gators’ season 
will likely depend on whether Flem-ing can continue to carry her success from the offseason into the regular 
season. 
Fleming, who had 37 digs in 30 
matches last year, will be backed up 
at the libero spot by sophomore Sun-dai Weston and junior Elissa Haus-
mann as freshman Taylor Unroe sits 
out the season to recover from ankle surgery.  
Depth could be an issue because 
of the inexperience at the position. Weston had just one dig after ap-pearing in only three matches last year while Hausmann had none in five matches. 
With Cusack having over 500 digs 
in each of her four seasons with the Gators, Fleming and her supporting cast have an immense challenge in 
front of them.
“After having Elyse as your libero, 
there’s a little bit of pressure coming in as a newbie,” Fleming said.Fleming set to become UF’s libero

� BOOS BRINGS AN AGGRESSIVE 
STYLE OF DEFENSE.
By GREG LUCA
Alligator Writer
gluca@alligator.org
 
Whoever said you can’t teach an old dog 
new tricks never met Mary Wise. 
Although Wise has been the coach at 
Florida for the last 19 seasons, the 2010 cam-paign will feature schemes on both sides of the court that are different from anything the Gators have ever done before. 
Thanks to the arrival of new assistant 
coach Dave Boos and an infusion of talented and versatile players, Florida will employ a number of different tactics designed to keep opponents off balance. 
“Dave is like a savant in terms of what he 
brings to the volleyball court,” Wise said. “I had the luxury of coaching with him a few summers ago in the USA A2 program, and I told him at the time that if I could ever get him to Gainesville, I was going to try.”
Wise still vividly remembers Florida’s 
2006 NCAA Tournament Regional Semifinal loss to Minnesota, where Boos was an assis-tant coach at the time. 
Wise claims it was Boos’ unique and 
aggressive defense that led to her squad’s demise and hopes she can adopt a similar scheme for this year’s Florida team.
“It’s risky and we’re taking some chanc-
es, but it is different from just about every-body else in the country and our team loves it,” Wise said. 
According to transfer Tangerine Wiggs, 
Boos’ system is one that involves a great deal of aggression in terms of blocks and digs. 
“We focus on committing to the block re-
gardless of whether its closed or not,” Wiggs said. “The defense is really working to see the hit based on the position of the block, and I think the defense is going to look great this year. We’ve really been working hard to dig up balls — only a few balls have been dropping in practice.”
On the offensive side, the team is still 
working on determining whether it will run the 6-2 attack that was the norm for the ma-jority of last season or the 5-1 formation that led to a 5-1 finish, with the only loss coming 
to national champion Penn State. 
“It’s hard to tell right 
now,” junior Kelly Murphy said. “We’ve been working more on the two-setter sys-
tem but I think that it’s just going to depend on how the season goes match-by-match.”
While the only major fundamental differ-
ence between the 6-2 and 5-1 is the number of setters a team has on the court, the type of players needed to make each system work effectively is very unique. 
For the first time in many years, Wise be-
lieves she has the personnel necessary to run either system at a high level. 
“I feel very comfortable that we could go 
with the 6-2, and a lot of that has to do with the fact that we’ve got a run stopper and a point scorer on the right side in Tangerine Wiggs,” Wise said.
Wise also cites Murphy as a primary rea-
son the team can be so flexible, as the junior has proven she can be dominant as both a setter and opposite hitter. 
If all goes according to plan, Wise will 
have a team capable of changing formations at a moment’s notice, thus keeping UF’s op-ponents off balance. 
“It’s one of those things as a coach that 
you’ve always wanted to do but didn’t have the personnel to do it,” Wise said. “I think this year we’ve got the personnel to do it, so it could be really fun as it develops.”

When Chipper Jones suffered 
a torn ACL, he said it sounded 
like a gunshot. When Willis Mc-
Gahee fell victim to the same in-jury, he writhed in pain as if he had been shot. 
Ashlee Elliott’s experience 
was nothing like that. 
One slight pop against South 
Florida last season and the two-time All-Southeastern Confer-
ence star knew exactly what  hap-
pened. 
“I’m just lying on the ground 
thinking ‘Really? It’s the third game,’” she said. “And I can 
hear (former teammate) Lauren 
Hyde behind me yelling ‘Get up. It’s just your ankle. Shake it off.’ I turned and yelled back, ‘You 
can’t shake this one off.’”
Some ACL injuries are devas-
tating. Some are simple. But all 
have a similar result: a daunting challenge awaits, but an appre-
ciation for what was lost can be 
gained.
Ashlee Elliott has come full 
circle. 
On Friday, she opened the 2010 
season and returned to the pitch where she suffered a torn ACL in her left knee nearly a year ago. Elliott returned in the best shape of her life, motivated to make ev-
ery second count.  She returned 
after struggling with indecision, weight gain and the worst pain she’s ever felt.
“At first I was just in shock,” 
said Elliott, a fifth-year senior who has started 59 games in her career at UF.
But in the medical room after 
suffering the injury, Elliott real-ized what had happened and she bawled.  
“Tears overwhelmed me,” she 
said. “I was like, ‘What am I go-ing to do?  Am I going to leave? Am I going to stay? The pros?’ I just didn’t know.”
But Elliott relied on her faith 
and strong family support and took the injury as something that happened for a reason. She vowed to come back harder than 
ever and help Florida claim its 
fifth consecutive SEC Champion-ship. 
“God wanted me to stay for 
this, and I know in the end God 
wanted me to have five rings 
on my hand and all my fingers filled,” she said.TOUGH  RECOVERY
The road back is never easy. 
Elliott labored through a painful surgery and was frustrated not being able to help her team on the field. 
She decided to return for one 
final season and complete her 
degree in Sociology. But when it 
came time to get back in shape, Elliott said she was lazy and not mentally prepared for the grind ahead.
“(UF coach Becky Burleigh) 
told me this was going to be ‘the hardest preseason of your life, ever,’” Elliot said. “I knew I had 
to cut back on everything and fo-
cus on what I needed to get done in preparation for the team.”
With the help of the training 
staff, Elliott got back in shape 
and strengthened her knee.  Fo-
cusing on jumping, cutting and stretching, Elliott said her knee is around 85 percent but feels as 
strong as ever. 
“I got a graph a couple of 
weeks ago and it looks like a 
healthy ACL,” Elliot said. “I’m proud of it. Hard work pays off.”
Elliott didn’t just want to re-
cover, she wanted to improve her conditioning.
“She really dedicated herself 
this summer to getting into the best shape of her life,” Burleigh 
said. “That’s really paid big divi-
dends because it has allowed her to focus on other things. Her body doesn’t get stressed so her 
mind isn’t as stressed and that’s 
allowed her to be a more rational leader.”
Elliott entered this preseason 
with a competitive intensity and 
reaffirmed her leadership role on 
the team.  
“Ashlee is all about not taking 
one day, one practice or one min-
ute for granted,” forward/mid-
fielder McKenzie Barney said. 
“She told me when she first came 
back that she just wants everyone to know how much these injuries suck and that she’s going to take 
every advantage of every second 
she gets.” 
A DIFFERENT ROLE
This time last year Elliott was 
the starting striker and scored UF’s lone goal to defeat Miami. 
But on Friday Elliott was in 
charge of not allowing Miami to score one back. 
Elliott changed positions and 
will fill graduated All-American Lauren Hyde’s spot at center back.
It was Elliott who unselfishly 
stepped up to fill the void left by 
Hyde. 
“I’ll play where they need me 
to play as long as I am on that 
field contributing,” she said. 
“I’ve played every position at Florida besides goalie. (Keeper 
Katie) Fraine can watch her back next time.”
Elliott has watched game 
film of Hyde and other defend-ers in preparation for her posi-tion change. And while she was a dynamite force at the top, the 
change wouldn’t be possible 
without the consistent play of her replacements last year, Barney and Lindsay Thompson. 
“Ashlee is a ferocious defend-
er and we really needed one of those in the back this year and she is the one that stepped up for it,” Barney said. “It says a lot 
about her coming back from that 
injury, too.”
Selflessly, Elliott put the team 
before personal accolades. But 
that doesn’t stop the defender 
from keeping her eye on the goal. 
“I want to score so bad, I’m not 
going to lie,” she said. “I want a 
couple of goals this year.”
Ashlee Elliott has no fears 
about stepping on the pitch. She’s 
brimming with the excitement to 
lead her team one last year. She’s 
encountering a new position and a new experience coming off a significant injury. She is looking forward but playing back.
“She’s going to have a terrific 
year,” Burleigh said. “There will be some ups and downs with a new position, but I think at the 
same time she’s really taken it in 
stride. She’s been awesome.”  Moving Forward, Playing Back

THE RALLY
Tyler: To start from the top, obviously 
Urban Meyer is Don Draper.
Mike: Hold on. First off, a note to our 
readers: If you haven’t seen “Mad Men,” 
fold up this paper, go plant yourself in front of a TV or computer and don’t get up until 
you’re done. We’re 44 episodes in. That’s 
just shy of 31 commercial-free hours, so with some dedication you’ll be caught up in less than a day and a half. 
Now, let’s get into it. As you brought up, 
UF coach Urban Meyer is Don Draper, and I couldn’t agree more. In short, he might be some kind of genius, he’s a man of few words and he almost never answers ques-
tions about his personal life. I have one ca-
veat with this, though. I don’t want anyone comparing Shelley Meyer to Betty. Betty is a child, and everyone hates her. Shelley is a saint.
Also, Mississippi State’s Dan Mullen is 
Peggy Olson. He (she) came up under Mey-er (Don), and Mullen has been an underrat-ed funny guy since he became a head coach 
and started speaking his mind. And I like to 
think Meyer gave Mullen the same “I can’t do it without you” speech Don gave Peggy.  
Finally, Vanderbilt coach Robbie Caldwell is Freddy Rumsen. Caldwell rocked the house 
at Southeastern Conference Media Days 
with his southern charm, talking about ev-erything from turkey insemination to being mistaken for a doorman. He’s likable and 
maybe out of his league (I sincerely hope 
I’m wrong there), thus making him Freddy. He’s not a recovering alcoholic, but Caldwell would be a really funny drunk. And, of the SEC coaches, he’d 
definitely make the 
best Santa Claus. No word on whether he can play Mozart on his 
zipper.
Tyler: I just hope 
Caldwell never passes 
out drunk and uri-
nates on himself before a big meeting. That 
wouldn’t be good for anybody.
As for the second-least likable character 
on the show (after Betty), USC coach Lane 
Kiffin is Peter Dyckman Campbell. Pete 
is young and insists he is the future of the business even if the older regime isn’t ready. And most of his colleagues can’t respect him because he never fought in a war, similar to 
how Kiffin was a backup quarterback in col-
lege. No matter what either man does, they can’t escape the shadow of their esteemed families. Pete accused Don of being a fraud, 
but the boss never really cared. Remember 
when Kiffin accused Meyer of a recruiting violation, only to receive a slap on the wrist from the NCAA? 
Who are the other partners? Seahawks 
coach Pete Carroll is Roger Sterling. They both have silver — not gray — hair and had affairs with women much younger than them (well, allegedly for Carroll). Penn State’s Joe 
Paterno is Bert Cooper just because both 
men are super-duper old. But who is Lane Pryce? There are no British coaches, but are there guys viewed as complete outsiders?
Mike: The Kiffin-
Campbell comparison works well with the wives, too. Layla Kif-
fin and Trudy Camp-
bell are both top notch. Using Carroll violates the terms of this dis-
cussion, but I’ll allow it. In that case, the Sea-
hawks are Jane Sterling for stealing him away.  
Lane Pryce is too hard for me to place, but 
how about Clemson’s Dabo Swinney as Ken Cosgrove? They’re both young and likable, 
and Swinney taking over after being the in-
terim coach reminds me of Cosgrove getting the nod for a promotion over Campbell after they were Co-Heads of Accounts.
Tyler: We’ve got to make the Paul Kin-
sey-Mike Leach comparison. Paul prided himself as the most eccentric worker in the office, the type of person who wrote plays 
and marched arm-in-arm with his black 
girlfriend during the civil rights movements just so he would have an interesting story to tell. And who is more eccentric than Leach? Who else has an office that also serves as an 
18th-century pirate museum? What other 
person, football coach or otherwise, dedi-cates himself every year to learning as much as he can in one specific area? Especially 
when those areas are Daniel Boone, Geroni-
mo and grizzly bears?
And Oklahoma State coach Mike “I’m a man! I’m 40!” Gundy is the Jimmy Barrett of our generation. Barrett was one of Amer-ica’s first shock comics. Gundy can get the 
same effect with one press conference.
Mike: I like Leach better as Salvatore Ro-
mano. The most identifiable things about Sal are that he’s Italian and gay, which don’t fit, 
but he was also a masterful artist (ever seen Leach’s offense?) and was forced out be-cause an entitled, spoiled daddy’s boy want-ed him gone. That means Adam “Trapped in 
the Closet” James is Lucky Strike’s Lee Gar-
ner Jr. For now, Sal and Leach are both out of the picture, but everyone wants them back. At least we get Leach as a TV analyst this 
year. I guarantee he sings “Bye Bye Birdie” 
during a breakaway touchdown run.
Tyler: I promise you he does not sing 
“Bye Bye Birdie.” The biggest question re-
mains, if Urban Meyer is Don Draper, what 
is his season four tailspin? Will the stress of having an entire company (or university) rely on him prove to be too much, like when 
Don turned to alcohol and lost his take-off-
your-pants-and-let-me-do-things-to-you charm? Or was last season his version of said tailspin, when coaching a media-satu-rated team drove him to the brink of retire-
ment?
Mike: I guess we’ll just have to tune in 
and find out. The most ironic thing about the Meyer-Draper thing is that Meyer is ter-
rible with ads. Ever see that Simply Orange commercial? Simply awful.
If NCAA coaches were characters from ‘Mad Men,’ who would they be?

Twitter: @McCallin_ItMONDAY, AUGUST 23, 2010 � ALLIGATOR, 49
Whether it was the time I spent in New York, summer’s 
natural lack of intellectual stimulation, or my inher-ent love for mindless reality shows, I now find myself 
relating all aspects of life to the MTV hit show “Jersey Shore.”
Sadly, the Florida football team is no different. 
Evidently, my brain was fried by hearing the words “yo,” 
“mad” and “bro” thrown into every sentence for three months 
because on my long drive back to Gainesville and a populous that cares about college football, I found myself matching up Gators with characters from “Jersey Shore.”
� DE Justin Trattou (The Situation) — “Sitch” is the real 
breakout star of Jersey Shore, and Trattou could become the breakout star of the 2010 season. The Situation once famously espoused, “Everybody loves me — babies, dogs, ya know, hot 
girls, cougars. I just have mass appeal.” And I’m sure the mild-
mannered, well-spoken Trattou could say the same. Plus, he’s from New Jersey, and I like the prospect of him referring to sacks as “situations” from now on. “What can I say, when the running back forgets to help in pass protection, that’s going to be a situation right there.”
� S Will Hill (Pauly D) — Hill, also from Jersey, is being 
counted on to help Trattou lead the defense, just as Pauly D helps the Situation lead the Jersey Shore cast. Everybody in the 
house likes Pauly, and Hill is well respected by his teammates. I suggest referring to Hill’s big hits on 
receivers as “blowouts.”
� RB Jeff Demps (Ronnie) — Ron-
nie has a good thing in his off-and-on girlfriend, but insists upon going to the 
clubs to hit on girls. Demps has a good 
thing in his track career. He’s the fast-est collegiate sprinter in the 100-meters and could parlay that into an Olympic career, as Ronnie could start a long-term relationship with Sammi. But Demps can’t resist the fast-paced fun of playing 
football with his boys (or bros, for any Northerners/Greeks reading this). Also, “full creep mode” could easily be a nick-
name for Demps’ top speed. “Did you see him turn the corner 
on that touchdown? He was really in full creep mode there.”
� QB John Brantley (Vinny) — Vinny is the surprisingly 
normal castmate. Viewers watch the show and think, “I could hang out with Vinny.” Everyone seems to be saying the same about Brantley. He’s one of us, just like Vinny. 
� RB coach Stan Drayton (Angelina) — Angelina decided 
to leave “Jersey Shore” early in Season 1, but returned when she realized she was missing a chance to be on one of TV’s big-
gest shows. The same could be said for Drayton, who left UF after the 2007 season and missed a second national champion-
ship. After a year at Tennessee and Syracuse, Drayton returned to UF just as Angelina returned to the house. 
� OL Carl Johnson (JWoww) — JWoww is the toughest 
chick on the show, just as offensive linemen tend to be the 
toughest players on a football field. I could see Johnson giving 
an opposing defensive lineman the tough choice of, “You can stay and get your ass beat, or you could stay and get your ass beat!” The same as JWoww yelled in Angelina’s face this sea-son. Johnson is listed at 355 pounds, but said he slimmed down in the offseason and now has a “beach body.” It’s safe to say his chest would turn as many heads at the beach as JWoww’s.
� S Ahmad Black (Snooki) — Black, an undersized safety, is 
the smallest guy on the defense, making him an easy choice for 
Snooki. When Snooki first got to the house, she thought about 
leaving because she didn’t fit in with the other roommates, but ultimately stayed and became a main character. I’m not sure if Black ever thought about transferring, but there were plenty of people who doubted his ability to become a starting safety at his size. He stuck it out and prospered just like Snooki. 
� RB Emmanuel Moody (Sammi) — Moody is a much 
more likable “character” than Sammi, but he shares a backfield with Ronnie (Demps). And he and Sammi always seem to be 
getting hurt, so that’s good enough for me.
Like ‘Jersey Shore,’ Florida football has its own cast of characters

SEC Quarterbacks 2010
2010 will mark a new era for Southeastern Conference quarterbacks, and not just because Tim 
Tebow’s gone. As many as seven teams in the conference will be breaking in new signal-callers 
this season. And no matter how much talent you have on the field, a team’s offense will only be as 
productive as the player under center (or in the shotgun). Just ask LSU fans about 2008. Or ask LSU 
fans about 2009. So, with so much riding on the passers, the alligatorSports staff ranked all 12 SEC 
teams based on how much confidence we have in their quarterbacks.
Arkansas
Quarterback: Ryan Mallett
Before the SEC Championship Game last season, Arkansas was the only team 
to threaten Florida’s defense. With less than 10 minutes left on Oct. 17, Mallett connected with receiver Greg Childs for a 75-yard bomb that gave the Razor-backs a 20-13 lead. The Gators rallied late, but not before the 6-foot-6 Mallett showed why he projects as a first-round NFL Draft pick after this season. Based on how wide the gap was between him and all other SEC quarterbacks last year, having another quarterback rank second is almost disrespectful. Mal-lett led the conference with 3,624 passing yards in 2009. The next best? Tim Tebow, with 2,895 yards.
Alabama
Quarterback: Greg McElroy
The terms “winner” and “loser” can often be unfair titles attached to quarter-
backs. More often than not, their record is based on his supporting cast. And McElroy had a great group around him, most notably a defense that allowed just 11 points per game and a Heisman-winning running back in Mark Ingram. But with the undefeated season on the line in the fourth quarter Nov. 27 against Auburn, McElroy was 7 for 8 on an 80-yard drive capped by a touch-down pass that gave Alabama a 26-21 win. And he hasn't lost since middle 
school, for what that's worth.
LSU 
Quarterback: Jordan Jefferson
Like coach Les Miles, Jefferson is on the hot seat after leading the Tigers of-
fense to just 304.5 yards per game, good for 112th in the nation last season. But he showed promise in games against Auburn, Mississippi State and Mis-sissippi, averaging about 240 yards and throwing six touchdowns versus one interception during that stretch. Jefferson was also inconsistent, managing just 96 yards and an interception at home against Florida. Perhaps the best thing going for Jefferson is backup Jarrett Lee, who was booed off the field after completing just 7 of 22 passes against Louisiana Tech — his only start of the 
season.
Ole Miss
Quarterback(s): Nathan Stanley, Jeremiah Masoli
Masoli is clearly the conference wildcard. Despite all the off-field issues that 
he brings, Masoli would be the best dual-threat quarterback in the SEC after leading Oregon to a Pacific-10 Conference Championship last season. And there is a reason Ole Miss took a risk on Masoli, who was kicked off Oregon’s team after pleading guilty to burglarizing a fraternity house and getting caught with marijuana in his car. The Rebels don’t have any other intriguing options. Nathan Stanley was ahead of Masoli at the beginning of training camp, but he 
never attempted more than nine passes in a game last season.
Auburn
Quarterback: Cameron Newton
Listed at 6-foot-6, 250 pounds, Newton has the potential to wreak havoc on 
defenses this fall. (He’s Tim Tebow, but bigger!) But as Gators fans know, New-ton doesn’t necessarily play as big as he looks. In six games at UF, Newton was just 6 of 12 for 54 yards before transferring amid controversy that followed a burglary arrest. At Blinn (Texas) Junior College, Newton led the Buccaneers to the junior college national championships last season, accounting for 3,488 total yards and scoring 38 touchdowns. But doubts linger about whether he 
can do that against SEC defenses.  Mississippi State
Quarterback(s): Chris Relf, Tyler Russell, Dylan Favre
Relf only attempted 41 passes as he backed up Tyson Lee last year, but Missis-
sippi State fans know he can run after scrambling for 131 yards and a touch-down against Ole Miss. But he could find himself used as just a change-of-pace option again this year as he is battling pocket passer Tyler Russell in training camp. And although he is only 5-foot-10, Dylan Favre has turned heads for be-ing more than just Brett’s nephew. He broke the Mississippi high school career touchdown mark by 40 and threw for 549 yards in one game last August. But again, he is also just 5-foot-10.Florida
Quarterback: John Brantley
Brantley has the potential — and weapons around him — to be as good as any quarterback in the conference. Gators receivers have praised him for being a more traditional (or “real”) pocket passer than his predecessor. In limited ac-tion last season, Brantley completed 36 of 48 passes for 410 yards and seven touchdowns. But fans will be anxious to see how the play-calling changes without a 240-pound quarterback in the shotgun this season. In his first career start Sept. 4 against Miami (Ohio), expect Brantley to post gaudy numbers before getting pulled in a blowout. To truly see how the promise of a five-star recruit translates into games, however, wait until Sept. 11, when he takes on South Florida, a rare respectable non-conference opponent.   South Carolina
Quarterback: Stephen Garcia
When he signed with the Gamecocks in 2007, Garcia was the gunslinger Steve 
Spurrier needed to recreate the explosive offenses that made him famous with the Gators in the ’90s. But through two years, Garcia has yet to excite South Carolina fans. He broke the school record last year for most single-season pass attempts, but he ranked only eighth in yards. Down three and near the Florida red zone in the fourth quarter last season, Garcia fittingly gave the game away when he was intercepted by Gators defensive end Justin Trattou. 
Georgia
Quarterback: Aaron Murray
After Bulldogs quarterbacks combined to throw 17 interceptions (four against Florida) last year, rumors surfaced about Mark Richt’s job security. And this season he will rely on a freshman as 2009 backup Logan Gray is working pri-marily at receiver this summer. Murray, a Tampa Plant High alumnus, was the No. 3 pro-style quarterback in the nation when he signed, according to Rivals.com. But while adjusting to SEC defenses comes with a sharp learning curve, Murray has a safety blanket in 6-foot-5 receiver AJ Green, who ranked second in the conference with 53 receptions last season.
Kentucky
Quarterback(s): Mike Hartline, Morgan Newton, 
Ryan Mossakowski
Before going down with a knee injury in the fifth game of the season, Hart-line had been the Wildcats’ most effective quarterback. That is not to suggest he was good. But he was effective. And to be fair, two of those games were against the SEC’s best defenses, Florida and Alabama. With Hartline out, New-ton had to burn his redshirt and, in his first two games, he threw for 39 yards and 17 yards, respectively. The most excitement generated from Kentucky’s offense was when receiver Randall Cobb lined up at the quarterback spot.
Tennessee
Quarterback: Matt Simms
Just when they thought they would never miss him, Tennessee fans watched 
as Jonathan Crompton closed out his unspectacular career on somewhat of a hot streak, throwing 20 touchdowns against just five interceptions in the last nine games of the year. Now the Volunteers are back to square one with Matt Simms, a junior college transfer and son of NFL star Phil Simms. But while he brings name recognition, Matt has little else to show for his college career so far. He appeared in two games at Louisville in 2008 before transferring to El Camino Community College, where he threw 17 touchdowns against 12 inter-ceptions.
Vanderbilt
Quarterback: Larry Smith
While half the conference is breaking in new quarterbacks this season, Vander-bilt fans get to watch the same signal-caller run out the tunnel as they did last year. Not that they’re happy about it. Smith started nine games last year and averaged just 125 yards. On the bright side, he only threw seven interceptions. But, of course, those seven interceptions don’t look good compared to the four touchdowns he managed — numbers that led to an 88 efficiency rating. By comparison, Tebow led the SEC with a 164.2 rating, and Garcia ranked 10th with a 119.3 rating.

Brandon Antwine shouldn’t be fodder for 
football sap stories.
He shouldn’t have to practice with a sense 
of desperation in his last training camp, 
shouldn’t be hoping just to salvage something 
from his five-year Gators career. 
When Antwine signed with Florida out 
of Garland (Texas) High in 2006, Rivals.com 
ranked him as a four-star defensive tackle, the type of player every stout run defense needs in the trenches. But since playing in nine games as a true freshman, Antwine has struggled to contribute on the field the past three seasons.
Antwine doesn’t fit the mold of a typical 
bust, though. Coaches haven’t accused him of being too lazy to adjust to the Southeastern Conference, and he isn’t a publication fabrica-tion who never faced tough competition be-fore arriving at Florida.
He’s just unlucky, really.A rare back injury sidelined Antwine in 
2007. He recovered. A rain-soaked field led to a torn ACL in 2008. He recovered. A shoulder 
injury kept him out of eight games last season. After sitting out the spring, he recovered.
And now, with at most 14 games left in his 
college career, Antwine hopes to become more 
than just a sad, cautionary anecdote for par-ents to tell kids about the dangers of football.
“He could have gone long ago and just 
taken a scholarship and taken a medical (hardship) and helped in the weight room and just hung out,” defensive line coach Dan Mc-Carney said. “He doesn’t want it. He keeps coming back. That’s how much passion, how much love he has for the game.”
ONE STEP FORWARD,
TWO STEPS BACK
During a practice in October 2007, Antwine 
suffered from dehydration and lower back pain. Doctors discovered acute kidney failure and, after undergoing tests, the 290-pound lineman learned he had an unusual muscle 
failure called lumbar spine myonecrosis, a loss 
of blood pressure that kills muscle cell fibers.
One of his lower back muscles was dead.After regaining normal kidney function, 
Antwine spent weeks in a wheelchair, then months learning how to walk again. He could only watch as the Gators continued without him, going 5-2 after his injury, including a 41-35 loss in the Capital One Bowl when Michi-gan torched the Florida defense for 524 total 
yards.
“I didn’t have a lot of time to be around my 
teammates,” he said. “I was kind of by my-
self.”
But while rehabbing was a grueling pro-
cess, Antwine never considered quitting. And almost one year later, he was back on the field as UF took on LSU on Oct. 11, 2008.
About two months after making his 2008 
debut, Antwine earned his first career start at FSU. After the game, however, he was not among the several Gators cel-ebrating a 30-point blowout.
Playing in the rain, Antwine 
planted his foot in the soggy 
turf as he tried to quickly change direction. His body went one way, but his leg stayed firm in 
the mud, causing his ACL to tear.
“I was just like, ‘No, not again,’” Antwine 
said. “It was hard. I was just trying to think 
positive. ‘I’m all right. I’m all right.’”
After rehabbing his back, though, Antwine 
said coming back from a torn knee ligament did not worry him. And, by last year’s season opener, he was back in the lineup. But, as has become standard during his 
time in Gainesville, bad luck struck Antwine again. In his second career start against Ken-
tucky, Antwine suffered a shoulder injury. 
He sat out two games before making his return at Mississippi State, where he rein-jured the shoulder. He sat out again until the SEC Championship Game, then un-derwent season-ending shoulder surgery.  
  
LAST CHANCE
After missing spring ball, he is back on 
the field this summer. And while Antwine is still relatively unknown, McCarney thinks he could be the team’s best defensive lineman this season.
In training camp, Antwine flashed the 
speed, aggression, quickness and technique that once made him a prized recruit.
“I say prayers for him every day that he 
stays healthy because, God, he’s been through so much,” McCarney said. “And if he can stay healthy I think he will have a chance to be one of those guys who will be a national story for what he’s overcome.”
After suffering three season-ending injuries 
in three years, Antwine still puts on his pads every day, leading some people to ask how much pain the human body can endure.
“I don’t know,” Antwine said, “but I’m 
willing to find out.”Antwine ready to put string of injuries in past

SEC FOOTBALL WEST EAST
ALABAMA
Coach: Nick Saban (42-8 at UA)
Players to Watch: QB Greg McElroy, RB Mark Ingram, WR Julio Jones, LB Dont'a Hightower, S Mark BarronOverview: Like Florida in 2009, the Crimson Tide is favored to repeat. Scoring points 
shouldn’t be a problem, as McElroy has the nation’s best cast of offensive playmak -
ers, but the defense is uncertain. Just two starters return on that side of the ball, and BCS Championship Defensive MVP Marcell Dareus could miss the season due to an NCAA investigation.
Key Games: Sept. 11 vs. Penn State, Oct. 2 vs. Florida, Nov. 26 vs. Auburn.
2009 record: 14-0 (9-0 SEC)
ARKANSAS
Coach: Bobby Petrino (13-12 at UA)Players to Watch: QB Ryan Mallett, WR Joe Adams, WR Greg Childs, LB Jerry Frank -
lin, TE D.J. WilliamsOverview: The SEC’s best passing attack in 2009 returns its Heisman Trophy candidate at quarterback and its top five receivers. The key will be fixing a defense that, despite the high-powered offense, struggled enough that the Razorbacks were outgained 420-383 in conference play. If that improves, Arkansas is a dark horse contender in the West.
Key Games: Sept. 25 vs. Alabama, Oct. 9 vs. Texas A&M (in Arlington, Texas), Oct. 
16 at Auburn 2009 record: 8-5 (3-5 SEC) 
AUBURN
Coach: Gene Chizik (8-5 at AU)Players to Watch: QB Cameron Newton, WR Darvin Adams, RB Mario Fannin, LB Craig Stevens, CB Neiko Thorpe Overview: There’s a lot to be excited about in Chizik’s second year. The Tigers should be improved on both sides of the ball, and if Newton, a Florida transfer, lives up to his potential as a dual-threat star, the West could come down to the Iron Bowl. Auburn gets all its tough games at home before the showdown with the Tide in Tuscaloosa.
Key Games: Sept. 25 vs. South Carolina, Oct. 16 vs. Arkansas, Nov. 26 at Alabama
2009 record: 8-5 (3-5 SEC)
LSU
Coach: Les Miles (51-15 at LSU)Players to Watch: WR Terrance Toliver, QB Jordan Jefferson, DT Drake Nevis, LB Kelvin Sheppard, CB Patrick PetersonOverview: Jefferson showed promise last season, and he comes back with a few playmakers at wideout. But the Tigers did lose their top two running backs and speedster Trindon Holliday. That, along with an inexperienced defense and road games at Florida, Auburn and Arkansas make winning the division an uphill battle.
Key Games: Sept. 4 vs. North Carolina (in Atlanta), Oct. 9 at Florida, Nov. 6 vs. Ala-
bama 2009 record: 9-4 (5-3 SEC)
MISSISSIPPI
Coach: Houston Nutt (18-8 at UM)Players to Watch: QB Jeremiah Masoli, DT Jerrell Powe, DE Kentrell Lockett, LB Jonathan Cornell, KR Jesse GrandyOverview: When reaching the Cotton Bowl is a disappointment, expectations are sky high in Oxford. That’s tempered now, as the offensive playmakers are gone, but Nutt has a reputation for succeeding as the underdog. If Masoli wins the job and shows the talent he flashed at Oregon, the Rebels could turn in a respectable season.
Key Games: Oct. 16 at Alabama, Oct. 23 at Arkansas, Oct. 30 vs. Auburn
2009 record: 9-4 (4-4 SEC)
MISSISSIPPI STATE
Coach: Dan Mullen (5-7 at MSU)Players to Watch: WR Chad Bumphis, OT Derek Sherrod, DE Pernell McPhee, S Charles Mitchell, CB Johnthan BanksOverview: Year 1 of Mullen’s tenure yielded some positives, and even though seven starters return on each side of the ball, it’ll be tough to escape last place this sea -
son. The biggest loss is workhorse back Anthony Dixon (1,391 yards), and trips to the two best teams in the conference won’t help matters much.
Key Games: Oct. 9 at Houston, Oct. 16 at Florida, Nov. 13 at Alabama
2009 record: 5-7 (3-5 SEC)FLORIDA
Coach: Urban Meyer (57-10 at UF)Players to watch: QB John Brantley, RB Jeff Demps, C Mike Pouncey, CB Janoris Jenkins, S Will HillOverview: The offense will look different behind Brantley, a stable of running backs and untested receivers, but UF will hope the defense doesn’t change. A host of stars are gone from one of the nation’s best units, and the Gators will go as far as their defense can take them. They should make it back to Atlanta, but getting past ’Bama is another story.
Key Games: Sept. 11 vs. South Florida, Oct. 2 at Alabama, Nov. 27 at Florida State.
2009 record: 13-1 (8-1 SEC)
GEORGIA
Coach: Mark Richt (90-27 at UGA)Players to Watch: WR A.J. Green, RB Washaun Ealey, TE Orson Charles, LB Justin Houston, CB Brandon BoykinOverview: New defensive coordinator Todd Grantham has to improve a unit that gave up 31 points per game in SEC play for the Bulldogs to take a shot at the East crown. Ten starters return on offense, and the one newcomer, quarterback Aaron Murray, will have to develop quickly. If not, the ever-hotter seat under Richt could reach the boiling point.
Key Games: Sept. 11 at South Carolina, Oct. 30 vs. Florida (in Jacksonville), Nov. 13 
at Auburn 2009 record: 8-5 (4-4 SEC)
KENTUCKY
Coach: Joker Phillips (fist year at UK)Players to Watch: RB Derrick Locke, WR Randall Cobb, G Stuart Hines, DE DeQuin Evans, LB Danny TrevathanOverview: The Wildcats’ offense will be all about getting Locke and Cobb the ball, and if their trio of quarterbacks can’t get the job done, that could mean Cobb in the wildcat formation. UK draws both Mississippi schools from the West, a break that could help its pursuit of a fifth-straight bowl appearance.
Key Games: Sept. 4 at Louisville, Sept. 25 at Florida, Oct. 9 vs. Auburn
2009 record: 7-6 (3-5 SEC)
SOUTH CAROLINA
Coach: Steve Spurrier (35-28 at USC)Players to Watch: QB Stephen Garcia, WR Alshon Jeffery, RB Marcus Lattimore, DE Cliff Matthews, CB Stephon Gilmore Overview: This is being billed as the year Spurrier has been waiting for, but it co -
incides with a brutal schedule. The Gamecocks have to face the three best teams from the West and travel to Florida and Clemson, but with 16 starters returning, there’s plenty of promise. The difference could come down to the talented-but-spotty Garcia.
Key Games: Sept. 25 at Auburn, Oct. 9 vs. Alabama, Nov. 13 at Florida
2009 record: 7-6 (3-5 SEC)
TENNESSEE
Coach: Derek Dooley (first year at UT)Players to Watch: WR Gerald Jones, TE Luke Stocker, S Janzen Jackson, DE Chris Walker, LB LaMarcus ThompsonOverview: The Lane Kiffin era didn’t go as planned, as he left after a year and didn’t exactly leave the cupboard stocked with talent. Highly touted back Bryce Brown left the team after Kiffin took off, and quarterback Matt Simms is an unknown quantity. A non-conference meeting with Oregon means the Vols won’t have much time to get things figured out.
Key Games: Sept. 11 vs. Oregon, Sept. 18 vs. Florida, Oct. 23 vs. Alabama
2009 record: 7-6 (4-4 SEC)
VANDERBILT
Coach: Robbie Caldwell (first year at VU)Players to Watch: RB Warren Norman, QB Larry Smith, LB Chris Marve, CB Casey Hayward, S Sean RichardsonOverview: The Commodores scored 8.9 points per game in their 0-8 conference slate, and with just 11 total starters coming back, there isn’t much reason to believe they’ll be better this season. Norman is the most exciting player, especially at kick returner, but it’ll take a lot more than that to lift VU out of the basement.
Key Games: Oct. 2 at Connecticut, Oct. 30 at Arkansas, Nov. 6 vs. Florida

If the shoulders of Justin Trattou and Duke Lemmens 
can carry as much weight as their scooter, the Gators’ pass 
rush should be in good shape.
The senior defensive ends often climb onto Trattou’s 
motorized scooter to get home from practice, a 505-pound test for the bike and an odd site for passersby.
“Obviously, it’s a chick magnet,” Trattou said.
Trattou, the tough kid from New Jersey, and Lemmens, 
the laid-back Californian, make for a funny — and odd — 
pair, but the task of facing them this season is a serious one.
They’ll be counted on to fill a big void at defensive end, 
where Carlos Dunlap and Jermaine Cunningham suited up last year before earning second-round NFL Draft se-lections.
“Those were two of the best pass-rushers and two of the best players in college football,” defensive line coach 
Dan McCarney said. “I know we have players who can be 
solid and consistent, but who can step up and make those plays on goal-line stands, 3rd-and-8, who’s going to get the pressure, make a sack, knock a ball out?”
UF coach Urban Meyer hopes Trattou and Lemmens 
are the answer to that question, but he doesn’t hide his apprehension.
“A little concerned,” he said. “We’re used to having 
some freaks out there.”
Trattou and Lemmens may look the part of “freaks” by 
season’s end, as they say they won’t cut their hair, but the term isn’t often used to describe their athleticism.
That fact isn’t lost on them, and both have breakout 
seasons in mind.
“There’s a bar set here at Florida for D-line, and I’m 
just trying to live up to that,” Lemmens said. “I know the guys who were here last year were awesome, and those are some big shoes to fill.”
Critics of UF’s defense would say the shoes are a few 
sizes too large for Lemmens.
The 6-foot-3, 250-pounder played in 32 games in three 
seasons, notching just two sacks and one start, but reviews of his play in practice 
have been positive.
Trattou called him “the most improved 
guy on the defense” from spring practice to 
fall camp. 
Meyer and McCarney lauded him for his leadership, 
with Meyer even calling him one of the faces of the pro-gram.
Still, none of that matters until Lemmens shows it in 
games, and he’s itching for the chance.
“I’ve just always been a serviceable backup my whole 
life and I know that,” Lemmens said. “I know that’s what everyone says about me. I love it. And it’s true. They’re not lying, but this is my chance to prove to everyone that 
I can do more than that.”
Lemmens will have to fight off competition from the 
likes of William Green, Lerentee McCray and highly tout-
ed freshmen Ronald Powell and Lynden Trail to keep his spot, but Trattou is entrenched as a starter.
Trattou will have to make the leap from an excellent 
backup to a star.
His first three years produced 18 starts, 15 tackles for 
loss, seven sacks and two interceptions. He made one of 
the biggest plays of UF’s 2009 season with a pick and 53-
yard return against South Carolina, stopping the Game-cocks’ potential go-ahead touchdown drive in the fourth quarter.And Trattou will have the added duty of serving as a 
team leader, a role that his teammates say he fills well. Center Mike Pouncey singled Trattou out as the top dog on defense with former UF middle linebacker Brandon Spikes gone, and defensive tackle Terron Sanders added 
that Trattou’s demeanor is well suited for the task.
“I have to say it’s that Jersey attitude,” Sanders said. 
“He has that spice about him. He’s one of the hardest 
workers this year. … He’s taken that role and ran with it.”
On a unit that lost most of its veterans, Trattou is one 
of the players grizzled enough to remember the Gators’ defensive turnaround from 2007 to 2008 (28 points per SEC game allowed to 12.5), and he’s using that example 
of a defense rising above expectations as motivation for 
his teammates.
“In our 2008 year, we headed into that season coming 
off a pretty rough year in 2007,” Trattou said. “We had the same type of role where we were just hungry and got after 
it, and that’s the same attitude we have right now.”MONDAY, AUGUST 23, 2010 � ALLIGATOR, 55

� GATORS LOST TWO TOP PASSING 
OPTIONS FROM LAST SEASON.

Urban Meyer doesn’t want to commit 
to an offensive style until one big question 
mark is answered.
“We all know what Johnny Brantley can 
do, we know we have a strong offensive line, we have a pretty good picture of what our running backs are going to do — now 
the final piece of the puzzle is the group 
out wide,” Meyer said.
With so many unknown variables sur-
rounding a revamped offense designed to cater to John Brantley’s prototypical quar-
terback mold, the play of receivers is go-
ing to dictate offensive coordinator Steve Addazio’s play calling.
“If they’re dynamic, you could see us 
at three or four wide,” Meyer said. “If you see a guy like Gerald Christian really come on, you could see us with a closed tight end. We’ve got to build around what we got.”
Right now, the Gators don’t know what 
they have.
Junior Deonte Thompson has shown 
the most by racking up 42 catches in two seasons. He leads the line of unproven UF wide receivers this season.
That group is made up of senior Carl 
Moore, who missed last season because of a back injury, Andre Debose, who red-shirted his freshman year after undergoing surgery from a hamstring issue, and Chris Rainey, who moved from running back to 
wide receiver in the offseason.
They will have to find a way to help 
generate an effective passing offense de-
spite the loss of two main contributors. 
Former UF wide receiver Riley Cooper 
and tight end Aaron Hernandez accounted for 55 percent of the team’s receiving yards last season. 
Much like that tandem was for quarter-
back Tim Tebow, Thompson and Moore are expected to turn into Brantley’s pri-mary options this year. Combined, the two players have accounted for just 56 catches 
in their time at Florida. Moore came to Gainesville as a junior 
college transfer with high expectations. 
Injuries and inconsistent play have not al-lowed him to live up to them yet. 
Meanwhile, Debose and Rainey are 
battling for a starting spot in the slot posi-tion.
Those two speedy and shifty players 
will be used in the “Percy (Harvin) posi-
tion” this season — an integral component to the Gators offense. Brandon James failed to produce at 
that spot last year. 
Much like Harvin, De-
bose has been taking car-
ries from the backfield in 
practice. But missing last 
season stunted his growth.
“He’s still young, he’s still green, he’s 
still got a lot to learn about playing out 
there,” wide receivers coach Zach Azzanni 
said of Debose.
Nobody knows how this group of re-
ceivers will fare. The coaches have yet to 
identify the offense’s playmakers.
“Usually, I have a handle,’’ Meyer said at the start of training camp. “I have no handle right now. I have an idea, but I couldn’t list you the top seven [playmak-ers] in order.”
However, if one of the starters disap-
points this season, depth is not an issue for the Gators.
Freshman Quinton Dunbar has im-
pressed coaches and players in practice. He caught a touchdown in Saturday’s scrimmage.
“He has a lot of natural talent, natural 
ability. He does things that are natural and 
instinctive,” Azzanni said.
Also, Frankie Hammond Jr., who is back 
on the team after being temporarily kicked 
off because of a DUI arrest, Omarius Hines 
and Stephen Alli all provide viable options 
at the position.
In a system that depends on placing ath-
letes in space to make plays on their own, coaches are still looking for playmakers 
with less than two weeks to go before the 
season opener against Miami (Ohio).
“That’s still our biggest issue on offense 
is playmakers, solidifying the front five, 
who they are going to be,” Meyer said.Play of unproven WRs to determine UF’s offensive identity
