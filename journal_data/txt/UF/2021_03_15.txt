COLORADO DENVER VICE CHANCELLOR
By Alexander Lugo
Alligator Staff Writer
Antonio Farias, UF’s first Chief Diversity 
Officer, who oversees diversity and inclusion 
efforts, left his post Monday.
His resignation triggered a search for a 
new Chief Diversity Officer that will most 
likely take months, according to UF’s vice 
president for human resources Jodi Gentry. 
It is unknown exactly how long the search 
will take, and Gentry’s office is still work -
ing on finalizing job qualifications for his re -placement.
The Chief Diversity Officer position was 
created in 2018 following controversies at UF 
including white supremacist Richard Spen -
cer’s visit to the university in 2017 and an 
incident with an administrator who was ac -
cused of racial bias when he pushed Black 
students off stage for dancing during the 
graduation ceremony in 2018.
Farias’ duties included meeting with orga -
nizations around campus, such as the Black 
Graduate Student Organization, Black Wom -
en’s Image Initiative, Pride Student Union 
and Student Success Services. The annual 
salary for the position was $288,400 in 2019, 
according to UF’s fiscal analysis. UF created the position to better support the diverse 
campus environment through grants, out -
reach and other policies.
But, in 2020 UF admitted the lowest num -
ber of Black students in the past five years. 
The numbers have decreased compared to 
ten years ago, staying under 10% since 2008. 
UF had 3,514 Black undergraduates out of 
34,365 in 2008, when diversity data started 
being recorded, and that number has dropped 
and stayed low ever since. The number of 
Black undergraduates dropped to 2,127 out 
of 37,880 in 2020.

THIS WILL BE THE LAST CITY 
ELECTION HELD 
ON ITS OWN 
By Jack Prator
Alligator Staff Writer 
Gainesville residents will vote 
on two city commission seats 
Tuesday.
District 1 incumbent Gigi 
Simmons is up against Desmon 
Duncan-Walker, founder of the 
Gainesville Alliance for Equitable 
Development, an advocacy 
organization that addresses 
inequitable development in 
Gainesville. 
For At-Large Seat B, incumbent 
Gail Johnson faces disbarred 
attorney Gabe Kaimowitz, running 
under the name “Gabriel Hillel.”
All registered voters can 
participate in the At-Large race, 
but only District 1 residents can 
cast their votes for Simmons 
or Duncan-Walker in the East 
Gainesville commission seat race.
Development in East Gainesville 
and public health concerns during 
the COVID-19 pandemic are hot-
button issues in the election. 
This will be the last city 
election held on its own. In 2018, 
Gainesville voted to hold city 
and county commission elections 
together in August and November 
starting next year.
Early voting ran until Saturday 
at the Alachua County Supervisor 
of Elections Office, Millhopper 
Branch Library, Reitz Union 
and the Martin Luther King Jr. 
Multipurpose Center.
Last week, the County 
Supervisor of Elections announced 
polling location changes. Due to 
ongoing renovations, Precinct 
27 voters will be unable to vote 
at the Thelma Boltin Center, the 
precinct’s regular polling place. 
The temporary polling location for 
the precinct is now the Thomas 
Center.
Votes on election day must be 
cast at voters’ specified precinct. 
Photo and signature ID is required 
to vote, per Florida law.

PEOPLE INELIGIBLE 
FOR THE VACCINE FIND 
WAYS AROUND STATE 
REQUIREMENTS
By Lucille Lannigan
Alligator Staff Writer 
Nadia Schmaler stopped at a 
Publix for a carton of milk and left 
with a COVID-19 vaccination.
The 21-year-old Gainesville resi -
dent and recent UF grad, who was 
ineligible for the shot under Florida’s 
eligibility criteria, heard of people 
who received leftover vaccine doses. 
Itching for a vaccination, she began 
her hunt, along with many others in 
the county and the state. 
Schmaler registered for waitlists 
and searched online for sites, but 
her hunt ended after one day when 
she happened to be at Publix at the 
right time. 
She was able to get her first dose 
of the Moderna vaccine around 6 
p.m., and a pharmacist gave her a 
vaccination card allowing her to re -
turn for the second dose. 
“I hate getting vaccines,” she 
said. “But this shot I was so happy 
to get into my arm; this feels so 
good.”
Facebook groups and vaccine 
hunting websites, such as vaccine -
hunter.org, tip people off to loca -
tions across Florida and other states 
where they may have a shot at get -
ting spare doses that would other -
wise be wasted due to the vaccine's 
short life span of about 6 hours. 
Each vial has more than one dose, 
and sometimes not all are used.
As of March 12, about 100,000 
Alachua County residents have been 
vaccinated, said Paul Myers, admin -
istrator for the Florida Department 
of Health in Alachua County. Vac -
cination sites vary each week as the 
department spreads them through -
out the county to reach more peo -
ple, he said.
COVID-19 positivity rates were 
below 1% Friday for the first time 
since last spring and have continued 
to drop, he said. But until the county 
vaccinates 20, 30 and 40-year-olds, 
who spread the virus the most, ac -
cording to Myers, positive cases will continue.
Schmaler thinks vaccination eli -
gibility should be expanded sooner 
to get the vaccines to as many peo -
ple as possible.
After receiving her shot, she 
wanted to help others and posted 
in a Florida Vaccine Hunters  Face -
book group where close to 10,000 
people share information on vaccine 
searching. 
“I’m happy that [the group] ex -
ists and that people are able to help 
each other out like that since the 
current system for navigating how 
to get a vaccine is not very user-
friendly,” she said. 
Some people are able to get a 
vaccine by signing up for waitlists at 
retail pharmacies. 
Walmart and Sam’s Club Phar -
macies began a waitlist for people 
who do not meet eligibility require -
ments. The Moderna vaccine admin -
istered by Walmart has a six-hour 
life span once opened, which means 
all of the doses must be used in a 
certain window of time before expir -
ing. When appointments are can -
celed, the store sometimes has left -
over vaccines, a Walmart employee 
who declined to be named said.
Myers said the county also has a 
waitlist to avoid wasting vaccines; 
however, because more than 600 
people are on the list as of March 12, 
he doesn’t encourage people to try 
to get a vaccine through the waitlist. 
Kaylee Whytal, a 21-year-old 
Publix pharmacy technician in train -
ing, said it’s difficult for people to 
get appointments at Publix because 
time slots open online in the morn -
ing and fill up within seconds. The 
website even crashed after too many 
people tried to sign up at once, 
Whytal said.
People from other counties travel 
to Gainesville to get the vaccine, she 
said. When these people run into 
commute issues, their appointments 
are canceled and their would-be 
vaccine doses are leftover. 
She said while Publix employees 
on the waitlist are prioritized, any -
one who happens to be in the store 
at the right time can be vaccinated. 
The policy is different at every 
Publix store, but pharmacy workers 
where Whytal works often reach out to immunocompromised customers 
first, she said. However, people who 
are looking for a vaccine should call 
or walk into the pharmacy around 
6 p.m. or 6:30 p.m. and ask about 
vaccine availability. 
Those who receive the Moderna 
shot, which Publix pharmacies of -
fer during the weekdays along with 
Johnson & Johnson’s one-dose vac -
cine on the weekends, will be signed 
up for a second dose and receive ap -
pointment information by mail. 
A FEMA vaccination site in Jack -
sonville has also administered vac -
cines to people who are not eligible 
for the vaccine under state criteria. 
The UF Chapter of the United 
Faculty of Florida sent a group of 
about 15 faculty members to the 
Jacksonville site by bus on Saturday, 
said Steven Kirn, co-chair of the uni -
versity UFF chapter.
The group left at 7 a.m. and re -
turned at about 11:20 a.m. fully 
vaccinated with the first dose of vac -
cines, Kirn said. 
UFF took this opportunity be -
cause UF faculty members under 
current Florida guidelines are not all 
eligible to receive the vaccine, Kirn 
said. The Jacksonville FEMA site, 
under federal guidance, allowed the 
group to get vaccinated despite not 
meeting the state’s requirements.
“If the university won’t do it, 
then we will,” he said.
 It cost UFF about $1,000 to send 
the bus to Jacksonville, he said. Kirn 
encouraged everyone who can find 
a way to get the vaccine to get one. 
“Get it,” he said, “because you 
help all of us – not just yourself.”

THIS IS THE COOKIE COMPANY’S 
EIGHTH STORE IN FLORIDA
By Gabrielle Gangler
Alligator Contributing Writer
The smell of freshly baked cookies wafting 
through Midtown is sure to draw in anyone 
with a sweet tooth.
Insomnia Cookies staff dressed in pajamas 
to cheerfully greet everyone who wandered 
inside the new store during its pajama-themed 
grand opening Saturday. Located directly 
across from UF campus at 1702 W University 
Ave., it’s the late-night cookie chain’s first Gainesville store and eighth Florida location. 
The store offers delivery to the College 
Park neighborhood, university campus and 
surrounding areas until 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. de -
pending on the day.
Following the closure of Cookiegazm and 
‘Phenomenom Nitrogen Ice Cream & Bake 
Shop in recent years, some UF students are 
excited about the arrival of a new dessert spot. 
Customers formed a line outside of the 
store two hours before the grand opening, 
awaiting promotions like the Lil’ Dipper, 
which was 24 mini chocolate chunk cookies 
given away for free to the first 25 customers.
Alexandria Rodgers, a regional trainer for 
Insomnia Cookies who came to help with the opening, was surprised by how many people 
came to the store’s opening. She said its loca -
tion among some of the popular student bars 
seemed perfect.
“We’ve had people say they can smell the 
cookies baking when they’re in the bars at 
Midtown, and that’s what draws them in,” 
Rodgers said. 
Daniela Duarte, a 21-year-old UF industrial 
engineering senior, arrived at the store with 
her parents during the grand opening to grab 
a snack. She said she has been looking for a 
new place for a late-night dessert ever since 
Cookiegazm closed.
“I’ve previously been to an Insomnia 
Cookies at UCF, so I was pretty excited when I saw a Facebook event advertising the opening 
of one here in Gainesville,” she said. 
Inside the store, customers are greeted by 
purple walls and a menu featuring flavors like 
double chocolate chunk, snickerdoodle and 
peanut butter chip.
Though Priyanka Perisetla has never tried 
Insomnia Cookies before, she was excited to 
hear of the store’s arrival in Midtown. The 
19-year-old UF biochemistry sophomore said 
it will be the “whole package” for future late-
night study sessions.
“Between the local delivery, ice cream and 
even milk, it’s going to be the perfect snack 
for when I’m studying ’till 1 a.m.,” Perisetla 
said.

HEALTH OFFICIALS LOOK AT 
HOW PANDEMIC TRENDS 
AFFECT CURRENT PLANS 
By Manny Rea
Alligator Staff Writer
A year after UF shut down on-
campus activity because of CO -
VID-19, students and residents are 
still dealing with the saliva tests, 
Zoom lectures and homemade cloth 
masks that disrupted daily life.
The start of 2020 signaled a grow -
ing threat to Gainesville residents 
when the CDC confirmed the first 
COVID-19 case in the U.S. Jan. 21. 
The Florida Department of Health 
announced its first two cases March 
1, urging Gov. Ron DeSantis to de -
clare a state of emergency shortly 
after. But while social distancing 
and mask-wearing persist, Alachua 
County is also feeling the added 
strain of more infectious variants.
With downward trending cases 
and increasing vaccine availability, 
things are finally starting to look up 
in Alachua County. But it comes af -
ter months of watching the number 
of cases and death toll rise. 
Here’s how UF and Alachua 
County managed the first year of the 
COVID-19 pandemic:
 
Pandemic kindlings
The county’s first confirmed case 
stunted everyday activities March 
10, 2020. Since then, 174,031 people have been tested in the county with 
a 4.87% total positivity rate, accord -
ing to the Alachua County recovery 
dashboard, which pulls data from 
the Florida Department of Health. 
By March 16, all UF classes were 
pushed online.
When classes resumed in Fall, 
college-aged people flooded back 
to Gainesville and originally drove 
those numbers up due to asymp -
tomatic spread, FDOH Administra -
tor Paul Myers said. 
The university faced its big -
gest spike in positive student cases 
with 217 added to the UF testing 
dashboard in one day on Sept. 13 
–– about two weeks after the first 
day of Fall classes. UF administra -
tion tried to manage the uptick in 
positive cases, facing struggles with 
quarantine dorms, testing and fac -
ulty ADA accommodations. 
Through contact tracing, the 
health department found restaurant 
and bar attendance by the younger 
population was most responsible for 
cases in the fall, Myers said.
When UF surpassed 5,000 to -
tal cases in late November, the re -
sponse was to prepare for the future 
by UF mandating biweekly testing 
for UF-affiliates on campus that 
started in Spring 2021.
Since about Feb. 26, the median 
age of positive cases has shifted 
from college-aged to people around 
40 years old, Myers said. He cited 
UF’s less than 1% positivity rate for 
on-campus testing as a sign that the university is in control of its popula -
tion, and students are heeding pub -
lic health advice. Meanwhile, Myers 
said the county’s positivity rate has 
ranged from 1% to 4.5% since the 
end of February.
Natural immunity from about 
22,000 cumulative positive cases in 
the county coupled with more vac -
cinations should address disease 
consequences such as COVID-19 
deaths in the elderly, Myers said. 
The county dashboard lists 13,464 
residents who’ve received one dose 
and 40,433 who’ve gotten both dos -
es as of March 14. There are about 
269,043 total residents in Alachua 
County according to 2019 estimates 
by the U.S. Census Bureau.
Semester hurdles
Some of the county’s highest 
case tallies came days after major 
holidays, including Thanksgiving 
and Christmas. Jan. 8 alone brought 
247 positive cases.
“That was really a perfect storm 
in terms of people getting together 
from different places inside,” Myers 
said.
In an attempt to avoid a similar 
fallout in the future, UF replaced -
Spring Break 2021, which would’ve 
started March 8, with an extra week 
in Winter Break. 
Reducing travel reduces spread, 
which reduces hospitalization, My -
ers said. Moving Spring Break from 
the middle of Spring semester to the beginning was an attempt to cut 
positive cases by limiting student 
travel.
The move aimed to give students 
more time to recover if they tested 
positive for the virus or quarantine 
before coming back, Ken Garcia, a 
UF Health spokesperson, wrote in 
an email. He noted the university 
has seen its lowest number of on-
campus cases since July 2020. 
“This is good news and we must 
continue our efforts to prevent 
spread of the virus,” Garcia wrote.
Regardless of any downward 
trends, viral mutations were an 
inevitable and normal course of 
events, John Lednicky, a UF Health 
virologist, wrote in an email. Alach -
ua County has confirmed seven pos -
itive cases of the mutation B.1.1.7 
first detected in the U.K. 
Mutations made the virus more 
infectious and may lead to the need 
for additional immunizations to be 
developed in response, Lednicky 
said.
The younger population is not 
invulnerable either, even if they feel 
the virus has no consequences on 
their health, he added. 
“The bottom line is that the new 
variants may in fact be causing more 
severe illnesses in younger people 
now,” Lednicky wrote. “The illness -
es may not be obvious at first but 
have long-term consequences.”
The possibility of brain fog, burn -
ing lungs, liver and kidney damage 
and other complications should be enough reason to continue social 
distancing guidelines, he wrote. Lin -
gering issues were even present in 
current virus strains.
A finale in sight
The county has access to the 
Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COV -
ID-19 vaccines and is awaiting ship -
ments of the single-shot Johnson & 
Johnson version, Myers said.
UF Health Shands Hospital 
has vaccinated less than half of its 
11,000 Gainesville employees, Gar -
cia wrote. The hospital’s efforts 
have totaled an immunization of 
about 42,500 people in Gainesville, 
Jacksonville and Central Florida, he 
wrote.
Additionally, Myers said eligibil -
ity will expand March 15 to ages 
60 and up alongside DeSantis’ new 
executive order for people deemed 
“extremely vulnerable” by a physi -
cian. This includes K-12 school em -
ployees, law enforcement officers 
and firefighters 50 years and older.
And while current guidelines are 
still a must, the CDC put out its first 
recommendations for fully vacci -
nated people March 8. On that list 
of approved activities: indoor visits 
without masks or physical distanc -
ing for vaccinated and low-risk un -
vaccinated people — indicating a 
return to normalcy.

THE RACE DECIDES WHO 
WILL REPRESENT 
EAST GAINESVILLE 
By Alan Halaly 
Alligator Staff Writer
East Gainesville activists and 
some residents have kept a watch -
ful eye on City Commissioner Gigi 
Simmons, 48, since she was elected 
to represent them in 2018. Now 
that she’s up for re-election, some 
are throwing their support behind 
her challenger — Desmon Duncan-
Walker.
Simmons faces Duncan-Walker, 
44, in the March 16 municipal elec -
tion to represent District 1, which 
encompasses most of East and 
downtown Gainesville. Some of the 
major issues currently facing the 
district are economic development, 
food insecurity and COVID-19 relief. 
If re-elected, Simmons would be 
the first District 1 commissioner in 
nine years to serve a second term. 
Scherwin Henry was the last to 
serve two terms from 2006 to 2012.
Duncan-Walker, founder of the 
Gainesville Alliance for Equitable 
Development, has been critical of 
Simmons’ decision to not support 
Commissioner Gail Johnson’s pro -
posal for a moratorium on develop -
ment. Through a commission seat, 
Duncan-Walker hopes to preserve 
East Gainesville’s historically Black 
neighborhoods.
“We too often hear local politi -
cians talking about big plans for 
Gainesville’s east side, only to find 
the area ignored while valuable resources go instead to facilitate 
and incentivize expensive develop -
ments elsewhere,” Duncan-Walker 
wrote in a February column in The 
Gainesville Sun. 
One of Simmons’ greatest ac -
complishments, she said, was when 
she coordinated the SkyBridge Edu -
cational Program at Porters Commu -
nity Center, an after-school program 
that supplied low-income public 
school students with 20 laptops and 
gave the center $20,000 to build a 
computer lab. She also worked with 
UF to create free mobile COVID-19 
testing sites over the summer, test -
ing more than 1,800 residents in her 
district. 
As of March 14, Duncan-Walker 
has raised more than $20,000 to 
Simmons’ $12,012. Notably, Sim -
mons received donations from Al -
ligator Realty Group and LVS Rental 
Services, LLC.
After having issues with the ac -
cessibility of Simmons’ predeces -
sor, Charles Goston, Carla Lewis-
Miles, a 49-year-old organizer in 
East Gainesville’s Duval Heights 
neighborhood, said she was excited 
about Simmons’ 2018 win. 
Lewis-Miles helped organize 
events and fundraisers for the 2018 
campaign because she appreciated 
Simmons’ perspective as a longtime 
resident of Porters, a historically 
Black Gainesville neighborhood 
located between UF’s campus and 
downtown Gainesville.
However, over time, Lewis-Miles 
said Simmons became increasingly 
inaccessible to her constituents and 
stopped responding to phone calls 
and emails, despite the pair having conversations on the campaign trail 
about the importance of collabora -
tion with community leaders. 
“We need somebody that doesn’t 
mind getting out there in the streets, 
and doesn’t mind the repercussions 
that come along with pushing back 
against the system,” Lewis-Miles, 
who filed to run herself before de -
ciding to withdraw, said. “Those are 
things that Gigi has shown us over 
and over again that she’s not willing 
to do.”
When asked about these con -
cerns, Simmons said if she missed a 
phone call or email, it was never in -
tentional. Aside from the COVID-19 
pandemic disproportionately killing 
residents in her district, she said it 
has also put a strain on her mental 
health because she’s lost friends 
and family members to the virus. 
“I am human,” she said. “I deal 
with loss like everyone else. If 
someone could not get in contact 
with me, I can honestly tell you 
there was a legitimate reason.”
Through her actions as commis -
sioner, Lewis-Miles believes Sim -
mons has shown she isn’t interested 
in fighting for the community that 
raised her. Lewis-Miles said Sim -
mons consistently leaves the best 
interests of East Gainesville out of 
her decision-making, leaving ac -
tivists like Lewis-Miles to rely on 
at-large Commissioner Johnson to 
vote in their favor. 
Simmons voted against a mora -
torium on development in East 
Gainesville. She also voted against 
the construction of affordable hous -
ing because she said the develop -
ment company was after a tax credit.
Duncan-Walker lobbied to pre -
vent the Seminary Lane plot, where 
an affordable housing community 
once stood, from being turned into 
luxury student apartments. She said 
she’s ready to fight for development 
that meets the needs of the commu -
nity. 
“Throughout my life I have kept 
my parents’ advice close: ‘Never 
forget that Gainesville is the bridge 
that brought you over,’” Duncan-
Walker wrote in The Gainesville 
Sun. “I want District 1 and all of 
Gainesville to be a place our chil -
dren can call home for generations 
to come.”  
Going forward, Simmons said 
economic development and health -
care are her main priorities.
“We deserve quality of life like 
everyone else,” Simmons said. 
“We are deserving of things in East 
Gainesville that we don’t have like 
grocery stores, healthcare centers 
and hospitals.”
Despite some residents’ ques -
tions about her voting record, there 
are voters who feel Simmons is the 
more experienced candidate.
Gregory Stetz, a 40-year-old 
East Gainesville resident, said he’s 
hopeful Simmons will serve another 
term. Tuesday’s election is impor -
tant because while the east side of 
the city has been subject to inef -
fective leadership before, Simmons 
has proved to have a nuanced un -
derstanding of the district’s issues, 
he said. 
He noted that she’s made sure 
to meet with experts who can help 
bring employment opportunities and better education to the area. 
“I fear Desmon being elected,” 
Stetz said. “She has shown she has 
no grasp of the complex issues fac -
ing our city, and would join Com -
missioners Johnson and Arreola in a 
voting pattern of ignorance.”
Other residents remain uncon -
vinced by Simmons’ voting record. 
East Gainesville resident Ar -
mando Grundy-Gomes, 40, said 
he’s frustrated with current elect -
ed officials who continue to fur -
ther the economic development of 
West Gainesville. He pointed to the 
fact that the east side of town has 
only one “proper” grocery store: a 
Walmart on Northeast 12th Avenue. 
Electing Duncan-Walker would 
be a positive change in city gov -
ernment because she will take a 
stand for East Gainesville, be will -
ing to meet with constituents regu -
larly and learn as she goes, Grundy-
Gomes said. 
After having conversations with 
other residents, he said he’s real -
ized he’s not alone in feeling like 
his voice isn’t heard. He said his 
interests as a Black East Gainesville 
resident are often sidelined by the 
current leaders on the commission 
as they continually push for west -
ward economic development.
“They talk a great game as if 
Black lives matter, but they don’t 
give two cents about Black people,” 
Grundy-Gomes said. “Their ac -
tions speak much louder than their 
words.”

THE SERIES EMPHASIZES 
THE VERSATILITY OF 
BLACK COLLEGE WOMEN
By Kristin Bausch
Avenue Staff Writer
For 22-year-old UF graduates 
Ashayla Blakely and Alena Drake, 
what started as creating reel 
content for future employers in 
October 2020 is now an ongoing 
web series on YouTube. 
“Blackview,” a web 
series created by the two 
telecommunications alumnae, 
aims to showcase the experiences 
of Black college women.
“It became a project that 
actually became influential to 
others which motivated us to keep 
going,” Blakely and Drake wrote in 
an email. 
The pair direct, write and 
produce the series, with the goal 
of highlighting the obstacles Black 
women experience in college.
“We know that Black women 
are always limited and presented 
as such on screen, so we also had 
in mind that we wanted to explore 
how versatile they are,” they wrote. 
“We wanted to create something that was authentic and relatable.”
The concept of versatility is 
something Blakely and Drake hope 
the audience can grasp.
“Black women are versatile,” 
they wrote. “We will say this 
probably 100 times. To describe 
Black women all in one category is 
merely impossible!”
“Blackview” actress and UF 
graduate student Haley Johnson, 
24, is pursuing a master’s degree 
of fine arts in acting. Johnson, who 
plays Dominique in the series, said 
she was afforded the opportunity 
by luck.
“I heard my friends were 
involved, and at the time, the 
series had its full cast,” Johnson 
wrote. “I told the creators if they 
needed anything to call me — few 
days later a lead dropped out, and 
they casted me as Dominique.”
As season two advances, 
Johnson said Dominique’s 
character continues to develop.
“Dominque is a bisexual activist 
who figuring out who she is,” she 
wrote. “She just broke up with her 
girlfriend and now exploring what 
it means to be single.”
Johnson hopes the audience 
can understand the concept of 
Black people and women in the media doesn’t have to be political 
or sad, but rather recognizable and 
relatable.
Season two of “Blackview” is 
currently being filmed, and Blakely 
and Drake explained they will 
expand on the storylines of season 
one’s characters. 
“We see one side of them in 
season 1, and in season 2 we are 
now given another side of them to 
really emphasize their versatility,” 
they wrote. “We are taken into a 
new journey with them as they 
learn how to deal with a new 
obstacle as they’re getting ready to 
graduate college.” 
Blakely and Drake explained 
although the series is tailored to 
Black college women, they want 
everyone to enjoy and take away 
something from the characters’ 
stories. 
“People want and NEED to hear 
these stories,” they wrote. “Some 
of these stories are ours. So not 
only are we given the chance to 
be a voice for others through our 
series, but we get to share our 
voices as well and get to connect to 
other people who may have shared 
the same experiences.”
UF dance junior Kristen Louder, 
20, wrote she has watched the first season of “Blackview” and is 
excited for season two.
“My favorite part about this 
series is that you get to see different 
Black girls through different 
lenses,” she wrote. “You get to see 
the things Black girls face and get a 
little more insight on how we think 
and do what we do.” 
Blakely and Drake wrote, as 
Black women, they felt it was their 
“rightful duty” to put out realistic 
content for their audience to see. 
“There are TV shows about 
college students, and some of 
them do have Black leads, but we 
noticed that their stories are not as 
realistic or versatile as they should 
be,” they wrote.
Although the two producers are 
not entirely sure what the future 
holds, they said season two is not 
the stopping point for sharing these 
stories.
“We want to keep expanding 
and diving into these stories,” 
they wrote. “The best part of it 
all is that ‘Blackview’ is designed 
to showcase the Black college 
women experience as you know, 
so that allows us to keep creating 
new characters and giving us the 
freedom to share even more stories 
while all still being in sync with 
what this series is all about.”
Blakely and Drake wrote they 
are always looking to collaborate with other Black artists and 
businesses.
They wrote most of their 
casting process is promotion 
through professors, crew members 
and their social media platforms. 
People interested in participating 
in the “Blackview” series as a crew 
member, cast member or sponsor, 
can reach out to Blakely and Drake

THE DOCTOR WAS RESPECTED 
WORLDWIDE FOR HER CONTRIBUTIONS 
TO SCIENCE RESEARCH
By Carolina Ilvento
Alligator Staff Writer
Even in her absence, Dr. Mavis Agbandje-McKen -
na’s fierce dedication to science and research serves as 
an empowering example for women in science. 
As a graduate student at Purdue University, she was 
the only Black woman in a conference to discuss virus 
development and gene therapy. At the time, the field 
was widely dominated by white male scientists, said 
Dr. April Burch, Agbandje-McKenna’s friend and col -
league of about 20 years.
“She was like a beacon of youth and color and per -
sonality,” Burch said. “I was in awe of her. 
 She was so fierce, so outwardly confident, no mat -
ter what she was struggling with.” 
Agbandje-McKenna, a UF Health biochemistry pro -
fessor and structural biologist, died March 3 of a neuro -
degenerative disease. She was 57.
She died at home of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, 
better known as ALS or Lou Gehrig’s disease, which is 
a progressive nervous system disease that causes loss 
of muscle control.
Agbandje-McKenna joined UF’s faculty in 1999, 
where she worked with research to develop disease 
treatment, according to her UF Health biography. Be -
fore coming to the university, she received her Ph.D. in 
biophysics from the University of London in 1989 and 
worked in different departments and laboratories in the 
U.S. and England.
As a female doctor herself, Burch said women in 
science struggle internally, but Agbandje-McKenna was 
just always “a light” in the field.
“Her laugh is something I will never forget,” Burch 
said. “No matter how stressful science got, and funding 
got, and competitiveness got, she always had her sense 
of humor.”
In 2018, Agbandje-McKenna received UF’s Innova -tor of the Year award for her work 
with AAV gene therapy, which 
uses engineered viruses to deliver 
working genes to a patient’s dam -
aged cells. She said in a 2018 UF 
Health article that this therapy 
technique would be a step in de -
veloping an understanding of how 
viruses like these work with the 
human immune system. 
In 2020, she received one of the American Society of 
Gene & Cell Therapy’s highest honors, the Outstanding 
Achievement Award, which is awarded to members of 
the society who have developed or achieved research 
success or made significant contributions to the gene 
and cell therapy fields.
Nicholas Muzyczka worked on gene therapy with 
Agbanjde-McKenna for close to 20 years at UF.
He said he was the first to volunteer to work with 
Agbandje-McKenna and her husband to study the biol -
ogy of the adeno-associated virus (AAV) at UF. He said 
he admired how smart and quick she was.
“It took me 20 years to learn how to write a grant; it 
took her 2 months,” Muzyczka said.
He said Agbandje-McKenna would tell everyone he 
had done something nice by teaching her grant writ -
ing before she became experienced, but Muzyczka said 
Agbandje-McKenna would have easily learned on her 
own.
“She was just so smart. She managed to go through 
any type of problem,” he said. “I mean, after a few min -
utes with Mavis, problems seem to melt away.”
Anyone who went into her office or lab would al -
ways find her smiling and laughing, Muzyczka said.
He said Agbandje-McKenna was the most fun col -
league he has had and will miss working with her.
She is survived by her husband Robert McKenna, 
their two adult children and the many friends and col -
leagues who knew and learned from her.

Agbandje-McKenna
enough time to change UF’s cul -
ture of diversity and predicted it 
would take five to ten years. 
“We’ve been exclusionary lon -
ger than we’ve been inclusionary 
as a university, and that’s not just 
UF, but all of higher education,” 
Farias said. “It’s going to take a 
significant amount of time to get 
us where we want to be.”
His resignation was announced 
Jan. 21 at a faculty senate meet -
ing. He’s heading to the Univer -
sity of Colorado Denver where 
he will be a vice-chancellor, UF 
president Kent Fuchs said at the 
meeting. Farias said he’s moving 
to be close to his daughter.
COVID-19 has made him re -
focus on what he values in life. 
“For me, it was being closer to my 
daughter,” he said.
Farias said his proudest ac -
complishment at UF was creat -
ing the Campus Diversity Liaison 
network, a group of faculty who 
work with Farias on diversity is -
sues. He said he thinks the net -
work will continue to have an 
impact around campus after his 
resignation.  
“The work will continue 
whether Antonio Farias is sitting 
in this seat or not,” Farias said.
Within a short period of time, 
during the COVID-19 pandemic and resurgence of the Black Lives 
Matter movement, Farias has 
done an exceptional job, David 
Canton, the director of UF’s Af -
rican American Studies program, 
said.
Farias oversaw the distribution 
of racial justice grants. He also 
co-sponsored events with Canton 
such as talks revolving around 
Black students navigating pre -
dominantly white campuses and 
racial inequality in healthcare, 
Canton said.
Canton doesn’t blame the re -
cent drop in Black undergradu -
ates on Farias — he said thinks 
the problem is more systemic. He 
stressed the importance of the 
new Chief Diversity Officer priori -
tizing Black student enrollment.
“I would say let’s focus on 
increasing Black student enroll -
ment. For the first year of the 
CDO, that should be their prior -
ity,” he said.
It’s important to keep pro -
grams running smoothly during 
the transition between Farias and 
the new Chief Diversity Officer, 
Canton said. He compared the 
transition to a successful sports 
team acquiring new players. 
“I hope whoever this new per -
son is keeps us winning and that 
we all work together,” he said.

THE BILL WOULD LIMIT STUDENTS’ 
FUNDING ACCORDING TO 
THEIR MAJORS
By Juliana Ferrie 
Alligator Staff Writer 
Students are protesting a proposed Florida 
Senate bill that may dramatically change who 
benefits from the Bright Futures Scholarship 
program. 
Senate Bill 86, filed by Ocala Republican 
Sen. Dennis Baxley on Feb. 23, would cut 
students’ Bright Futures financial aid in half 
depending on their major. For the scholarship 
program to cover all 120 credit hours needed 
to earn a bachelor’s degree, students must be 
enrolled in a program of study that will “lead 
directly to employment,” according to the bill. 
Students and parents around the state felt 
angered by the proposed bill –– over 100,000 
have signed a petition against it as of Sun -
day and some created a website called “Save 
Bright Futures” to explain the bill, its next 
steps and how to help prevent it from being 
passed. At UF, Alondra Arce, a 20-year-old 
sustainability studies and sociology sopho -
more, organized a group of students March 7 
to paint a mural on the 34th Street Wall and 
bring awareness to the bill. 
Students worked on the mural from 12 
p.m. until around 2 p.m., Arce wrote in a 
text message. They painted the scholarship 
program’s logo and the phrase “Save our 
Bright Futures.” Underneath, they wrote 
“#StopSB86” and “#KeepOurFutureBright.” 
The list of degrees that would qualify for 
Bright Futures funding under the proposed 
bill would be determined by the Board of 
Governors and the State Board of Education 
on an annual basis. The bill was postponed 
on the Florida Senate Education Committee 
agenda March 9 and will be heard again Tues -
day. 
The postponement comes after the bill met 
extensive backlash from students and parents 
around the state.
Established in 1997 and funded by the 
Florida Lottery, the Florida Bright Futures 
Scholarship Program awards college tuition 
to high school students with high academic achievement. During the 2019-2020 school 
year, 25,190, or about 71%, of undergraduate 
UF students benefited from Bright Futures, 
UF spokesperson Cynthia Roldán wrote in an 
email. 
Bright Futures recipients fall under two 
categories: Florida Academic Scholars or 
Florida Medallion Scholars. Florida Academic 
Scholars are awarded 100% of their tuition 
fees, while 75% of tuition is covered for 
Florida Medallion Scholars, according to the 
Bright Futures Student Handbook. 
In order to qualify, Florida Academic 
Scholars must have a 3.5 GPA, 100 service 
hours and a 1330 on the SAT or a 29 on the 
ACT, according to the Bright Futures Student 
Handbook. Florida Medallion Scholars need a 
3.0 GPA, 75 service hours and a 1210 on the 
SAT or a 25 on the ACT. 
The Board of Governors and the State 
Board of Education would choose what career 
certificate, undergraduate and graduate de -
gree programs are “market-driven,” accord -
ing to the press release. The list of programs 
must be made by Dec. 31. Students who are 
not enrolled in an eligible program will re -
ceive funding for only 60 credit hours starting 
in the 2022-2023 school year if the bill passes. 
Cutting funding from the Florida Bright 
Futures Scholarship Program will also reduce 
the number of credit hours a student can re -
ceive through “articulated acceleration mech -
anisms.” These include Advanced Placement, 
dual enrollment, the International Baccalau -
reate Program, credit by examination and the 
Advanced International Certificate of Educa -
tion Program, according to Florida Statute 
1007.27. 
Roldán said 95.6% of UF students have 
advanced credit. This percentage was calcu -
lated over several years and remains consis -
tent, she wrote in an email. 
In addition, the Florida House of Repre -
sentatives filed a bill  Feb. 24 aiming to give 
out-of-state students in-state tuition prices if 
they have a grandparent who is a legal resi -
dent of Florida. To qualify, the students also 
must have earned a high school diploma, its 
equivalent or completed a home education 
program and scored in or above the 89th per -
centile on the SAT, ACT or Classic Learning 
Test. Students only qualify if they will enroll at 
a state university as a full-time student the 
Fall immediately after graduation, according 
to the bill. 
Richard Burt, a UF English professor, said 
earning a degree isn’t only about getting a 
job.  
Because some majors within the College of 
Liberal Arts and Sciences would become too 
costly to study, Burt worries enrollment could 
drop if Bright Futures changes. Humanities 
allow individuals to reflect on society’s ac -
tions and to develop empathy, he said. 
“If you want UF to be in the top 10, it has 
to have humanities,” Burt said. 
Arce started her UF career as a biology 
major. She said she dreamed of becoming a 
veterinarian, but after starting college, she re -
alized she wasn’t passionate about what she 
was learning. 
After switching her major, she began per -
forming better in her classes and retaining 
more information, she said. She worries she 
wouldn’t receive Bright Futures funding for 
her new major under the proposed bill.
“I don’t think I should be punished be -
cause of that,” Arce said. “If anything, I 
should be celebrated because I figured out my 
passion and my goal and path in life.” 
As a low-income student, Arce said Bright 
Futures plays a role in her ability to go to 
school and prevents her from having to worry 
about going into debt. She is concerned about 
whether students already in college will be 
grandfathered into the bill for the 2022-2023 
school year. 
Although only her senior year would be 
affected, she said the bill will impact other 
students for years to come. 
“If anything, it’s going to put the majors 
in a caste-like system,” she said.Isabel Mi -
tre, a 20-year-old UF College of Engineering 
computer science sophomore, chose a STEM 
major because it’s what she likes and wanted 
to study. She doesn’t think students should 
be asked to study something they aren’t inter -
ested in to afford college. 
“I think incoming college students will 
have to make the decision of what they study 
based on financials,” she said. “I know that’s 
the entire reason I came here to the Univer -
sity of Florida because it was the best option financially.” 
Oscar Santiago, an 18-year-old UF political 
science freshman, opposes the bill’s plans to 
cut credit hour funding by a student’s number 
of dual enrollment and AP credits. He said he 
believes students should be able to go to col -
lege without worrying about their finances. 
“Many people come from different back -
grounds, and a lot of people come from poor 
backgrounds,” Santiago said. “Bright Futures 
is an avenue that allows for students to go 
to college without worrying that they’ll be in 
huge debt.”  
Because the bill is vague, Santiago worries 
his major will be included on the list, he said. 
As a pre-law student, he said he is unsure 
whether the bill will consider majors students 
typically choose to study with intentions to 
apply to law school. 
Santiago signed petitions against the bill 
and also called Sen. Keith Perry, R-Tallahas -
see, who represents Alachua County, to voice 
his concern, he said. 
“I’m trying to do anything I can to stop the 
bill,” Santiago said.

MEN'S BASKETBALLCOVID-19, A SHUTDOWN AND 
PLAYING FOR THE SEASON THAT 
NEVER ENDED
By Ryan Haley and Sara Kate Dyson
Sports Writers
Eleven months and nine days. That’s how 
long Florida’s baseball bats lay dormant.
“Some days it feels like a year and some 
days it feels like five years,” UF coach Kevin O’Sullivan said Wednesday.
Last year, O’Sullivan and his team won 
their first 16 games, ascended to the pole 
position of Baseball America’s rankings and 
seemed poised for a run at the program’s sec -
ond national championship.
Then came March 12. As COVID-19 spread 
its fingers to the corners of the U.S., the SEC 
suspended all spring sports, including base -
ball. O’Sullivan called his team to Alfred A. 
McKethan Stadium for what became their fi -nal meeting of the 2020 season, forced to tell 
his roster that no one knew when they could 
play again.
For some players, the gut-punch hit deeper. 
The prospects expiring eligibility or a profes -
sional contract loomed over the team the way 
a storm cloud threatens to pour. Jack Leftwich 
and Tommy Mace, pitchers and draft hope -
fuls, thought the news unceremoniously end -
ed their collegiate careers. 
“We were sitting in McKethan in the dug -
out, and we were crying because we thought 
that was for sure the last time we were gonna 
play there,” Leftwich recalled.
What followed tested the Gator baseball 
program in ways it never experienced. Months 
without practice or games, social distancing 
and isolation, testing protocols and bubbles. 
Even away from the diamond, classes 
moved online, which altered the lives of all 
college students. Student-athletes rely on a 
strict schedule to balance athletics with class -
work. 
Suddenly, that schedule was thrown into 
chaos, completely uncertain and at the mercy 
of experimentation. Even O’Sullivan felt the 
ripple effects as he learned how to adjust to 
a homeschool lifestyle with his own two chil -
dren. 
A year later, COVID-19 still lingers in day-
to-day life. But there's a silver lining. Florida 
baseball is back —  in a sleek, new stadium. 
Leftwich and Mace remain in Gainesville with 
almost everyone from the 2020 team.
“Knowing that we got to come back with 
our brothers and play was a great feeling,” 
third-year left fielder Jacob Young said. 
The Gators played their first intrasquad 
scrimmages in October. They unveiled Florida 
Ballpark to the public on opening night, Feb. 19, almost 11 months after that fateful team 
meeting.
“Knowing that last year our season was cut 
short, it means a lot being on the field right 
now,” fifth-year infielder Kirby McMullen 
said. 
But just because the Gators know how im -
pactful the 2021 season is doesn’t mean they 
aren’t celebrating it.
“Practice, games, we’re a really close group. 
So when we get to play any type of baseball, 
we love it,” Young said. “So it’s a great feeling 
knowing that we’re back together.”
The team, just like the rest of the world, 
continues to hold its breath until it crosses 
the finish line. Fans must wear face coverings 
and follow attendance limitations in the new 
stadium. The team still operates under health 
and safety restrictions.
O’Sullivan called it all a work in progress 
for his team both mentally and physically. The 
athletes missed out on nearly a year of com -
petitive baseball. To O’Sullivan, his players 
need more time to get back into the groove 
they left off last March. 
“I think there’s a lot of things that still have 
to get worked through mentally to get to a 
point where we feel really good,” O’Sullivan 
said. “The world changed a year ago.”
The sports community did change, maybe 
permanently. The sports world may never re -
turn to its state before March 12, 2020.
But whatever reality the future holds, Flor -
ida baseball won’t lag.

FLORIDA WILL TAKE ON THE 
HOKIES FOR THE FIRST TIME 
SINCE 1991
By Declan Walsh
Sports Writer 
As Florida basketball limped 
to the finish line with a double-
digit drubbing against Tennessee, 
experts began to relegate UF into 
the dreaded 8-9 matchup in the 
NCAA tournament. 
But to the surprise of Florida 
fans and the bracketology 
community, the selection 
committee looked past UF’s 
recent skid and placed the Gators 
as a No. 7 seed in next week’s 
March Madness. 
The Gators drew No. 10 
Virginia Tech as their first round 
opponent. The Hokies suffered 
from COVID-19 cancellations 
and only played three games in the past month. Before its 17-
day hiatus, VT nabbed a pair of 
eye-catching wins against fourth-
seeded Virginia and fifth-seeded 
Villanova. 
However, the Hokies 
accompanied the Gators off a 
late-season cliff. Virginia Tech 
suffered convincing losses against 
fellow tournament teams Georgia 
Tech and North Carolina and 
failed to beat a top-100 team in 
February, according to KenPom. 
Florida should be favored 
to advance, but the Gators will 
need to sort out the following 
issues before looking ahead to 
likely meeting Ohio State in the 
NCAA Tournament since the 2007 
National Championship Game.
Help a Mann out
Sophomore Tre Mann 
embraced his five-star billing and 
emerged as Florida’s superstar. The projected first-round draft 
pick averaged 24 points in the 
last four games, and his absence 
against Tennessee March 9 
factored into UF’s second-half 
meltdown. 
However, Mann’s lurch into 
the limelight hasn’t stabilized 
UF’s woeful offense. The Gators 
shot  29% from inside the arc 
against the Volunteers Friday and 
failed to exceed 70 points since 
January. 
The apex of Florida’s season 
was a Jan. 30 victory at West 
Virginia. This win vaulted UF 
to 18th in offensive efficiency 
rankings and showcased its 
balanced arsenal of scorers. 
Junior Colin Castleton earned  
All-SEC honors after a breakout 
offensive campaign, but he  
averaged just seven points in the 
last three games. Junior Noah 
Locke disappeared for large stretches of UF’s rough patch and 
heralded recruit Scottie Lewis 
averaged fewer than four points 
in as many games. 
Mann’s newfound knack for 
the clutch will be essential for 
Florida to make a run in the NCAA 
Tournament, but the Gainesville 
native will need lumbar support 
from the Florida offense.

Florida’s early-season prowess 
behind the arc looks like fool’s 
gold with UF’s dramatic regression 
to the mean. Florida shot 24% 
from three in February, a figure 
recently buoyed by Mann’s 
superhuman performances. 
Castleton has been massively 
overlooked during this offensive 
trough. The big man averaged 
10.5 field goal attempts during 
his first 11 conference games, a 
figure that has n nearly halved over the past seven games. 
The Michigan transfer’s 
defensive game correlates 
with his offensive production. 
Castleton hosted weekly block 
parties at the start of conference 
play, but he swatted just six shots 
in the last six games. 
Keve Aluma, who leads VT in 
points, rebounds and usage rate, 
is the lifeblood of Virginia Tech. 
Castleton will draw that daunting 
defensive assignment. The 15-6 
Hokies are just 1-3 when Aluma 
scores fewer than 10 points, so 
a defensively stout Castleton 
factors in a huge variable in 
Friday’s contest.
The game will be broadcast 
Friday at 12:15 p.m. from Hinkle 
Fieldhouse on CBS. It’s the 
first non play-in game of the 
tournament.

RUNNING SOARED IN 
POPULARITY AT UF AFTER 
THE OUTBREAK OF 
COVID-19
By Faith Buckley
Sports Writer
Juliette Clavier and Hannah 
Whittle lace up their sneakers and 
hit the sidewalks, every step takes 
their mind further from a year in a 
pandemic-ridden world.
The pandemic offset the 
traditional course of college. 
Restaurants closed, classes 
became remote and life shifted to 
a primarily online platform. Some 
students sought out hobbies, 
including drawing, cooking and 
writing.
Running gained more traction 
with the pandemic’s progression. 
Clavier, a 21-year-old UF applied 
physiology and kinesiology junior, 
and Whittle, a 20-year-old UF 
psychology junior, found their 
passion for running at The Swamp. 
 They ran a stadium — one lap 
around Ben Hill Griffin Stadium’s 
first floor — for the first time last 
March when campus closed for 
the semester. They started running 
stadiums because of gym closures 
and made workouts with chairs and other equipment.
 The duo exercises in The 
Swamp once a week and freshens 
up on leg and arm workouts. At 
the start of the pandemic, campus 
resembled a ghost town, so there 
were no eyes on the two while 
they worked out, Clavier said.  
As summer turned to fall, 
runners swarmed the stadium.
 Clavier and Whittle run about 
twice a week, though it takes 
some get-up-and-go willpower at 
times. Clavier said staying on top 
of it makes her feel accomplished 
and healthy afterward.
“While I’m going, the only 
thing I’m focused on is to keep 
going,” Whittle said. “All the other 
stressors I have are released.”
 With mental health challenges, 
college students use running as an 
outlet for their stress.
 For 20-year-old UF philosophy 
senior Juan Serrano, running is an 
old hobby with a new meaning. 
He started running in middle 
school and now does so to stay in 
shape. 
Serrano runs three to four 
times a week because of the 
pandemic. It gives him an excuse 
to leave his apartment and enjoy 
the outdoors, he said.
“I come to a brick wall, where I just can’t focus as much or I feel I 
just need to procrastinate on some 
assignments,” he said. “Being 
able to go outside and run helps 
me kinda clear my mind.”
 Serrano runs around SW 13 
Street and University Avenue and 
said the empty roads that surround 
campus give him serenity.
 Elliot Haynes, a 19-year-old 
UF education sophomore, began 
running her first semester of 
college. She joined her Delta Zeta 
sorority sisters at the beginning of 
the pandemic and hasn’t looked 
back since.
“They (Delta Zeta) introduced 
me to it, and I just started coming 
out here because it was a good 
form of exercise,” Haynes said.
 She frequents The Swamp 
about five times a week and runs 
up and down the stairs and along 
the field’s outer frame. Haynes 
runs to get out of the house and 
stay healthy, she said.
 Running fulfills the COVID-
19-enacted void plunged into 
students’ lives. In a year defined 
by uncertainty, runners know 
they always have their shoes and 
the sidewalk to count on.
