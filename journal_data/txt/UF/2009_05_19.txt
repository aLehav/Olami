UF will cut its budget by about 
$42 million and eliminate about 
150 positions, UF President Bernie Machen told the Faculty Senate on Friday.Seventy-two of those positions 
will be faculty, 80 will be staff, Ma-chen said.
The cut will also include some 
layoffs, but he declined to say ex-actly how many.
After the meeting, he said there 
would be fewer than a dozen faculty layoffs and a “fair number of staff layoffs.”
The $49-million figure, cited as 
the size of UF’s budget cut last week by a UF spokeswoman, was based on incorrect information.
Machen said about $30.6 million 
of the $42 million will be saved by cutting vacant positions, reducing expenses and other eliminations. Of that, about $12 million to $13 million will come from eliminating vacant positions, and more than $6 million will be saved by switching programs from state funding to non-state funding, he said.
About $8 million will be saved by 
universitywide administrative cuts, like capping sick leave payouts and creating an early retirement pro-gram.
The remainder, about $3.6 mil-
lion, will come from undetermined sources, he said.
More specifics about the cut will 
be released later this week, he said.

A proposed change to UF’s regulations that 
would have given the university more control over who it lays off has been tabled until the fall after a unanimous Faculty Senate vote on Friday.
The senate voted to ask UF to postpone the 
proposal until next semester, when more fac-ulty will be on campus to consider the issue. Though the vote wasn’t binding, UF obliged.
The new regulation would have changed 
the definition of a layoff unit, which came under contention recently when two laid-off professors were reinstated after successfully challenging UF’s interpretation of the unit.
Currently, a unit targeted for layoffs can be 
no smaller than a department.
This was deter-
mined by an arbitra-tor who ruled against the university in 
March in the case of assistant professor An-drea Pham. The arbitrator ruled UF improper-ly laid off Pham because it was attempting to eliminate the Vietnamese program, in which 
Pham was the only professor.
Because the program is smaller than a de-
partment, it was found not to be an acceptable 
layoff unit.

A Florida Highway Patrol State Trooper is 
in stable condition after a wreck on Interstate 
75 northbound left his patrol car jammed un-
der a tractor-trailer on Monday.
Trooper Richard Ornowski, 54, was taken 
to Shands at UF after the vehicles collided less than a mile south of the Newberry Road exit.
At about 11:20 a.m., Ornowski was respond-
ing to a call for backup from another state trooper who was working an existing crash at the Newberry Road overpass.
Ornowski was driving north in the left lane 
when, for an unknown reason, his car swerved to the left, according to FHP spokesman Pat-rick Riordan.
Ornowski’s car then quickly veered to the 
right striking the metal guardrail in the medi-
an with the back left side of his car, he said.
Riordan said that when swerving to the 
right, Ornowski’s patrol car partially entered 
the center lane where it was struck by the under-cage of an A Truck Line tractor-trailer Collision with

USF grad missing in Costa Rica
TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — The University of South Florida says a 
21-year-old recent graduate has gone missing in Costa Rica.
According to a USF news release, authorities in Costa Rica have 
been searching for Aly Lakdawala since Saturday. Lakdawala went 
missing while he was swimming in Pacific Ocean.
Lakdawala earned his degree this spring. He double majored in 
international studies and philosophy. Lakdawala is participating in a community service trip in rural Costa Rica with other USF students.
USF Dean of International Affairs Maria Crummett was flying to 
Costa Rica to help in the search. Other university staff members are already on the trip.SEE  CUTS, p AgE 10

Man charged in deadly
Haitian boat accident
MIAMI (AP) — A Haitian man 
was charged with human smug-
gling Monday after federal au-thorities accused him of piloting a boat overloaded with migrants 
that capsized off Florida’s coast, 
killing at least nine people, includ-ing a pregnant woman.
Jimmy Metellus, 33, is sched-
uled to appear in federal court Wednesday on charges of smug-gling that caused the death of an-other person. Court records did not list an attorney for him Mon-
day. A conviction could result in 
the death penalty or a life prison sentence.
Metellus, a Haitian citizen who 
also has permanent U.S. resident status, was among 16 people res-cued when the boat capsized early last Wednesday off Boynton Beach, about 60 miles north of Mi-
ami. Most of the survivors — 15 
Haitians and one Jamaican — will be deported to their home coun-tries under U.S. policy.
U.S. Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement said the dead in-cluded two men, six women and an infant. Authorities also issued a separate death certificate for the 
pregnant woman’s 8-month-old 
unborn fetus. Two women and a baby remained hospitalized Mon-day, and the other survivors were in immigration custody. Five peo-ple are listed as missing.
“ICE strongly discourages 
people from taking to the seas and attempting to illegally enter the 
United States through maritime 
means,” said Anthony Mangione, chief of the ICE Office of Investiga-tions in Miami. “Tragically, many have lost their lives while attempt-ing this illegal and treacherous trip.”
According to an ICE agent, 
Metellus told investigators he was 
hired by a man known only as 
“Shine” to pilot the vessel from the Bahamas to the U.S. with about 30 undocumented migrants aboard. The affidavit says Metellus was offered $6,000 for the trip but de-cided instead to be paid with free passage on the boat.in. The teen yelled for everyone to get down, cursing at the class.
Nobody moved. Gaspard 
knew the boy, whom he de-scribed as quiet and nice, and thought it was a dramatic en-actment for some sort of lesson. Then, he said, the boy walked over and pointed the gun at the teacher, ordering her to say, “Hail Marilyn Manson,” refer-
ring to the shock-rock icon, Gas-
pard said.
She said nothing. He fired 
into the wall and told another boy to get up. The seventh-grad-er stayed in his seat, and the teen left.
Hill-Peters, the spokeswom-
an, said she couldn’t confirm 
Gaspard’s account.
“After a situation like this 
you’re going to have a lot of kids, 
a lot of parents, a lot of people saying a lot of stuff,” she said.
The school was scheduled to 
reopen Tuesday with enhanced security and several counselors on hand.
 
Kennedy denies claims made in new book
NEW YORK (AP) — Caro-
line Kennedy denied Monday 
that she ended her quest for the U.S. Senate because her kids and husband complained she was 
becoming an angry, intense per-
son.
Kennedy, the daughter of 
slain President John F. Kennedy and niece of Massachusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy, said on NBC’s “Today” show that reports she dropped out of the race because her family no longer recognized 
her as a cool, composed mother 
and wife were “absolute non-sense.”
A new book, “Ted Kennedy: 
The Dream That Never Dies,” by Edward Klein quotes an attorney saying Kennedy became “loud, harsh and grating” in pursuing the appointment.
Asked why she pulled out, 
Kennedy replied, “That was the right decision. There are many ways to serve.”
Asked what she thought of 
Gov. David Paterson’s handling of the selection process to fill the seat vacated when Hillary Rod-ham Clinton ascended to U.S. 
Secretary of State, Kennedy an-
swered, “I’ve moved on.”
The book depicts jockeying 
inside the family to carry on the tradition of public service through politics after Sen. Ken-nedy was diagnosed with brain cancer. Kennedy felt the appoint-ment “would automatically be 
hers,” the book states, citing an 
unidentified family adviser.
When Paterson didn’t im-
mediately name her to succeed Clinton, the book says, she be-came angry.

Sheriff: La. 8th-grader 
planned school shooting
LAROSE, La. (AP) — A Louisi-
ana middle school student stormed 
into a classroom and fired a gun-shot over a teacher’s head Monday before shooting himself in a bath-
room, authorities said. Investiga-
tors found a suicide note and plans for a rampage in the teen’s journal.
The 15-year-old student, whose 
name was not released, fired once around 9 a.m. inside a classroom at Larose-Cut Off Middle School, then shot himself in the head, said Lafourche Parish Sheriff Craig We-
bre. He was in critical but stable 
condition. The teacher had never taught the teen.
Webre said investigators found 
a note describing the boy’s plans to “gear up” before his spree, along with a drawing of how he’d dress. The boy also scribbled “I am king” and “y’all will die!” on a sheet of 
paper investigators found.
Although he apparently was 
intent on killing people, he was 
armed with only four bullets for the .25-caliber, semiautomatic pistol he had taken from his father’s home during the weekend. The boy’s mother noticed he seemed nervous before school, but he said he was 
just worried about seeing his stan-
dardized test results, which were released Monday, Webre said.
About 500 sixth-, seventh- and 
eighth-graders attend the school in a rural community of about 7,000 people, some 45 miles southwest of New Orleans. Webre said the boy had no disciplinary problems at 
school and hadn’t been in trouble 
with the law. The teen had no rea-son to be in the classroom, he said.
He was a year or two older 
than most of his classmates, who described him as a quiet boy who never talked about guns or vio-lence.
Webre said investigators found 
inside the boy’s bookbag a com-pletely filled journal and two loose sheets of paper that appeared to be a plan for the shooting and a suicide note. The school has both standing and handheld metal de-tectors, but they aren’t used all the time and weren’t in use Monday.
Webre said the boy arrived 
at the school in uniform — white shirt, khaki pants — but changed into camouflage pants shown in his drawing. In an expletive-laced note, he wrote, “First, I will tell my art class teacher that I had to go to the bathroom. Then I would go to the last stall and ‘gear up.’”
Eighth-grader Dustin Sevin said 
the boy has been his friend for sev-eral years and that he never talked about guns or violence. At the end of second period, his friend said he needed to see the nurse and left with his backpack.
The teen apparently headed to 
another classroom, walked to the front of the room and pointed the 
pistol at the whiteboard, said sher-
iff’s spokeswoman Sgt. Lesley Hill-Peters. He tried to fire at the board, but it wouldn’t go off. He then stepped forward, pointed the gun at the teacher, raised it and fired a single shot over her head.
Coley Gaspard, 14, said he was

reading class when the boy came

The Gainesville Police Depart-
ment is looking for witnesses to 
a fatal shooting in which an Ala-
chua County Sheriff’s deputy shot 
and killed an 18-year-old man af-ter a struggle.
Nicholous Vertex Weeks, 18, 
was shot several times on Friday by Lt. Mike Hanson after physical force and the use of a Taser gun did not stop Weeks from attack-ing the deputy, said Gainesville 
Police Department spokesman 
Keith Kameg.
“There were at least 25 wit-
nesses at the scene,” Kameg said. 
“But we are continuing to look for 
other witnesses who know any-thing.”
It is still unclear how Weeks 
got to the intersection and why he 
was enraged, Kameg said.
The State Attorney’s Office and 
ASO will assist GPD in the inves-
tigation of the incident. Because 
the incident happened inside the 
city limits, GPD will lead the in-vestigation, according to Kameg.
Although GPD received the 
results of Weeks’ preliminary 
autopsy, the final autopsy results 
and a toxicology report, which could reveal drug use, are still be-ing performed, Kameg said.
The incident occurred around 
12:50 p.m. on Friday. GPD re-ceived calls regarding a man and 
woman fighting in a car at the 
intersection of Northwest 34th Street and 39th Avenue. 
According to a witness account 
on the SKY97.3 Web site, Weeks stopped a random car and tried to pull-out the driver. 
Before GPD officers arrived 
at the scene, Hanson, who was on duty, pulled-up and tried to stop the fight, Kameg said.  
Hanson shot Weeks with a Taser 
gun when Weeks attacked him.  
After being Tasered, Weeks at-
tempted to grab the deputy’s gun. Hanson then shot Weeks several times, killing him on the scene, 
Kameg said.
Kameg said the only reason 
someone would go after an offi-cer’s gun is to hurt or kill.
“Ninty-nine times out of 100, 
if you go for a deputy’s gun, you are creating a life and death situ-ation,” he said. “Officers will take 
whatever actions are necessary, including deadly force, because 
we cannot let our guns be taken.” Hanson has been placed on ad-
ministrative leave with pay while 
an investigation of the incident 
takes place.LOCAL

Despite recent cases of swine flu 
at schools across the United States, 
including one case at UF, there were only about 10 students at a lecture 
about the virus Monday night.
About 75 people attended Dr. J. 
Glenn Morris lecture, “Emerging Pathogens and Pandemics: Swine 
Flu and Other Things That Go Bump in the Night.” The event was 
held in Emerson Alumni Hall.
Morris, director of the UF Emerg-
ing Pathogens Institute, spoke Mon-day night about influenza, cholera, 
malaria and other epidemics as part of the UF Alumni Association Lec-
ture Series.  
The lecture quickly turned to the serious and often frightening topic 
of emerging pathogens, with an em-phasis on the H1N1 influenza virus, 
initially known as swine flu. 
While other pathogens are 
alarming to humans, the influenza virus is particularly destructive be-
cause of its ability to mutate. The vi-rus’s unusual gene structure makes 
mutation both easy and inevitable, 
Morris said. 
“It’s like pick-up sticks,” he said 
of the genes within the flu virus. “You can toss them up in the air and pick them up and put them back to-
gether in new combinations.”
The H1N1 virus gets its name 
from hemagglutinin and neuramin-idase, two proteins that combine to 
create a flu strain. It was dubbed swine flu because six of the virus’s eight genes are believed to be from pigs, he said. 
Although H1N1 is similar to 
regular seasonal flu, which has a mortality rate of about 1 per 400 to 500 people, Morris said it is impor-
tant to remember that the virus is 
potentially fatal and is continuing to spread.
“It’s dropped out of the news, 
but we are indeed in the midst of an epidemic of influenza caused by this flu,” he said. 
As an effort to combat H1N1 
and other influenzas, Morris said 
he hopes to vaccinate 70 percent 
of school children in the Alachua County school system this year. 
Because data shows that children 
are more likely to spread flu, Mor-ris predicts immunizing children 
in Alachua County could prevent 
27,000 illnesses and 31 deaths.
Diane Pecora, an RN specialist 
at the Student Health Care Center, said that flu immunization is an im-portant step that students don’t take 
advantage of, even when it’s free.
Students who don’t like shots 
can request a mist treatment, which is painless and more effective in 
preventing various flu strains, she said.Each year, the Center for Disease 
Control pick three flu strains to in-clude in the flu vaccination. 
The current flu vaccination does 
not offer protection against H1N1, but Morris is hopeful that the CDC 
will decide to include H1N1 in 
this year’s mix. The decision will be made in the next two weeks, he 
said. 
Even though H1N1 has proven 
to be mild so far, Morris said it is important to keep a watchful eye 
on developing pathogens across the world.
“Diseases don’t recognize na-
tional boundaries. They don’t get passports to come visit us,” he said. 
“If we want to understand diseas-
es, we need to have a global pres-ence.”

� HEARING TESTS OFFERED MAY 20 
AND MAY 27.
By MICHAEL HERBERT
Alligator Contributing Writer
For those who haven’t heard, there are 
two more chances to get a free hearing 
screening as part of May’s Better Speech and Hearing Month. 
The screenings, which are open to the 
public, will be offered at UF’s off-campus 
hearing and speech clinic located at 1405 NW 13 St. 
They will take place between 11:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m., this Wednesday and May 27.
“We want to offer a service to allow 
people to see if their hearing is in the nor-mal range,” said Ryan Baker, a doctor at the 
clinic.
The screenings are pass-fail and are dif-
ferent from hearing tests.
They provide a starting point for doctors 
to determine if treatment is needed for hear-
ing loss.
During the screening, tones are played 
through headphones and the patient must 
signal when he or she is able to hear the 
tone.
Since the clinic’s opening in 2006, the 
screenings have been offered biannually and used to be held on-campus, Baker said.
Jarryd Bailey, 21, spent the past year deal-
ing with the academic and social difficulties of hearing loss.
“I don’t think I could ever take [my hear-
ing] for granted again,” he said.
Bailey suffered an ear infec-
tion and a punctured eardrum 
and has recently regained his 
hearing.
“I couldn’t hear my professors; I couldn’t 
hear conversations right in front of me,” he 
said. “I just couldn’t compete.”
Bailey said he thinks the screenings are 
important and that people don’t realize how 
much they need their hearing until they lose it. 
According to a UF release, hearing loss 
affects more than 36 million Americans. 
Much hearing loss is permanent, but 
hearing aids, rehabilitation and assistive listening devices can be used by patients if 
audiologists deem them beneficial.
“Hearing loss takes shape in many 
forms,” Baker said, adding that it can be 
caused by anything from wax buildup to 
permanent nerve damage. 
Medical issues such as wax buildup can 
be treated by removal, he said.
Permanent damage, however, is treated 
through aural rehabilitation and amplifica-
tion through hearing aids.Students, residents can screen hearing at local clinic

Watermelon flowed freely at 
the 64th annual Newberry Water-
melon Festival, where attendants snacked on the juicy fruit and celebrated the town’s signature tradition Saturday.  
The festival ran Friday and 
Saturday at Canterbury Equestri-an Showplace and featured carni-val rides and traditional games, 
such as a seed spitting contest, 
watermelon rolling, hog calling and a baking contest.                                                         
It is the longest running wa-
termelon festival in the nation, 
according to Tia Bonnell, presi-
dent of the Newberry Watermel-on Festival Committee.
“It began in 1946 to welcome home soldiers from the war. Wa-termelons were predominantly producing at that time and the 
tradition stuck with us,” she said.
This year’s festival included 
more than watermelon. Food 
vendors ranged from Newberry’s Deli and Grille to Welcome to the Swamp Southern Style Fried Al-ligator Tail.
Eight contestants competed 
for the 2009 Newberry Watermel-on Festival Queen crown, a tradi-tion as old as the festival.Contestants modeled evening 
gowns, gave speeches on agricul-
ture and participated in the seed 
spitting contest. 
This year’s crowned queen 
was Brandi Harrison, 18, a New-berry local.
“I practiced a lot prior to the 
festival,” Harrison said, beam-ing. “I feel so excited and over-whelmed. LOCALNewberry locals scarf melons at 64th annual festivalBy ROBERTA O. ROBERTS

Reggae Shack Café assured 
customers that “every little 
thing is going to be all right” 
with Jamaican restaurant’s re-
opening today at 11 a.m.
The restaurant, 619 W. 
University Ave., had been 
closed since Feb. 8 for renova-
tions.         
“We wanted to upgrade 
our look,” said Omar Oseli-
mo, owner of Reggae Shack. “We wanted to enhance the Reggae Shack experience.”
Renovations included ex-
panded seating and an up-
grade to the kitchen and air 
conditioning. 
“We have three times the 
amount of seats from before and a lot more space. We did a lot of little things to make it more comfortable,” Oselimo 
said.
The restaurant also ex-
panded the menu in response 
to customer requests, adding sandwiches such as jerk burg-ers and “currified” chicken 
sandwiches.Oselimo recommended 
oxtail, the Shack’s signature 
dish, for first time customers. 
“And if you’re vegetarian, 
then try the vegan steak or curry tempeh,” he said.
The restaurant was origi-
nally scheduled to open Mon-day, but the date was pushed 
back to today due to “last 
minute details.” 
Oselimo said that they 
have received about 50 calls 
a day since they installed the 
phone line two 
weeks ago, so 
he expects it to 
be a “little cra-
zy” when they 
reopen. 
“I am excited and look for-
ward to providing delicious food and great service for a 
very long time in Gainesville, 
the best city in America to live 
in,” he said.
In terms of great service, 
Chris Gilmore, a UF sopho-
more agrees.
“People there are really 
nice, and they always greet you with a smile,” he said.“It 
makes the food taste better.”Jamaican restaurant reopens doors after make-over

OPINIONS EDITORBullet’s Burden
Deputy should be 
commended for heroism
Don’t save some of that for the sequelColumn
Ask any man or woman who makes a career out of serv-
ing the community in the field of law enforcement: it’s a tough job. Police officers embody a unique group of 
people who tirelessly give of themselves for the greater good of the public, all the while constantly risking his or her life. 
The most trying challenge of the position, however, lies in the 
responsibility of brandishing a handgun — a burden where a strong sense of self-restraint easily trumps a case of trigger-happy hands.
For Lt. Mike Hanson, a 13-year veteran of the Alachua Coun-
ty Sheriff’s Office, responding to a traffic incident on Friday quickly turned into a fight for his life. According to an article in The Gainesville Sun, Nicholous Vertex Weeks, an 18-year-old Gainesville resident, had been weaving in and out of traffic 
on foot as he tried to knock out car windows and pull a wom-
an from her car. Less than a block south of the intersection of Northwest 39th Avenue and 34th Street, Hanson encountered Weeks, where the two men began fighting. 
Relying on his Taser gun to subdue Weeks, Hanson’s weap-
on failed to deter the assailant — presumably due to his 6-foot-4-inch, 225-pound frame. What transpired, by all accounts, was a brawl in which Hanson suffered injuries to his face and head. With his glasses smashed and radio left inoperable, Hanson 
shot his gun several times at Weeks, leaving the man dead after 
he made repeated attempts to gain control of the lieutenant’s weapon.
At initial glance, the officer responded to the scene in a logi-
cal and reasonable fashion given the circumstances. Not only was Hanson’s life in immediate danger, but one could only assume what may have happened if Weeks managed to gain possession of the lieutenant’s gun. Given the innumerable by-standers within proximity to the altercation, Hanson was left 
with no choice but to remedy the situation by any means nec-
essary — a decision that came after all other plausible options were exhausted.
Yet, according to Jennifer Weeks, the grandmother of the de-
ceased, Hanson fired seven bullets at her grandson. This infor-mation, if true, raises the issue of how many shots are enough to adequately control an assailant without risking the safety of the officer and bystanders at the scene. Can three bullets be deemed an appropriate course of action, while seven indicates excessive 
force on the end of the officer?
The most telling figure is the fact that the average police 
officer will never fire a single shot in the line of duty over the 
course of his or her tenure. To say Hanson acted inappropriate-ly or responded in an unsuitable manner would be to contend that such a situation reflects a common occurrence rather than a once-in-a-career event. While Hanson and all police officers receive training to respond to hellacious incidents such as the one that transpired Friday, the emphasis should not be placed 
on how many times Hanson fired his weapon at Weeks. Simply 
put, police officers, like all people, are fallible individuals who run through a gamut of emotions when faced with the pros-pects of shooting another person.
This is not to argue that Hanson was out of line for the num-
ber of shots he fired to end any chance of Weeks causing him or anyone else further harm.
Rather, what matters is the fact that Hanson was left with 
no other choice but to rely on his handgun as a last resort to 
subdue Weeks — especially considering his Taser gun’s lack of 
effectiveness. Given the severity of the circumstances and the 
uncontrollable demeanor exhibited by Weeks, Hanson’s actions 
speak of a law enforcement official exhibiting courageousness 
and heroism to the umpteenth degree.
For showing immense restraint before turning to his hand-
gun, we applaud Lt. Mike Hanson as he endured a shift more akin to South Central Los Angeles than North Central Florida.

172 TOTAL VOTESI was a bit bored yesterday when I noticed that the Sci-Fi 
Channel was running the first two “Saw” films, back to 
back. Now, it’s been some time since I’ve seen the “Saw” 
films, and so I watched them both. The first one was, as I remembered, a wonderful little horror movie with an in-
triguing perspective on things. The second one was, while moderately entertaining, nowhere near the quality of the 
first film. As I sat and pondered the sad state of “Saw,” it 
occurred to me that there are still three more films after the 
second, with a sixth in production right now — each has 
been worse than the last and has been clearly motivated by 
a lust for profits. This bespeaks a serious problem implicit 
in the blending of art with profit.
The “sequel”. Is there anything worse in the film in-
dustry? Well, possibly the prequel, but it’s a close call. The dance is always the same. A movie comes out that is truly 
good; a movie that captures the imagination of the audi-
ence and sends everyone home happy. Now, in order to fall victim to this “rape of creativity,” a film need not neces-
sarily be a work of art — after all, it happened to the “Die 
Hard” films as well. But it’s all the more tragic when the 
film is inspired and well-crafted. I heave a sigh for the film 
industry when, like Medea, it murders its own children.
The list of films that have been ravaged through fran-
chise is familiar to everyone who knows anything about 
movies. I’ve already cited the example of “Saw.” “Scary 
Movie,” which, while not artistic, was really the first sort of parody film of its kind for my generation, has suffered the 
same fate. And hey, remember how cool the first, esoteric 
“Matrix” film was, before the franchise descended into ri-
diculous Christian allegory with Neo as Christ in the last 
film? 
Then, of course, there is the most well-known example of a filmmaker’s unbridled greed, overweening arrogance and pos-
sible psychosis leading to the utter 
destruction of something that was 
once amazing: the “Star Wars” pre-
quels. With those prequels, George Lucas has succeeded in taking one 
of the most engaging, brilliant, epic 
and revolutionary film series of all 
time and reducing it to an object of 
derision for cynics like myself. Oh, and not just that, he also managed to squeeze a pathetic Computer-Generated Im-
agery film, “Star Wars: The Clone Wars,” out of it. It is for this reason that Patton Oswalt is so fond of saying that if he 
could, he would go back in time and murder George Lucas 
with a shovel. Personally, I would bludgeon him with the 
original “Star Wars” VHS box set.
Will this orgy of greed and philistinism ever end? The 
answer, unfortunately, is no — not as long as there is a single dime to be rung out of the public by repackaging 
the same tired sequels. I eagerly await “Austin Powers IV,” 
“Saw VII,” a new “Matrix” film and, of course, “Star Wars” 
episodes VII-X, complete with merchandizing and televi-
sion spin-offs. As long as people will pay, this Black Mass 
will continue. When it reaches its crescendo, perhaps 
George Lucas himself will emerge from a darkened room, 
dressed in a black robe, kill the Coen brothers and then, sated, return to slumber until he unleashes another Jar Jar 
Binks on the world.
Remember, McDonald’s is a franchise, a movie is a 
work of art.

Hard power, soft power, smart power — what is the 
right mix of U.S. resources for engaging with the world and its challenges? This is a question sweep-
ing through Washington, and rightly so, as the Obama ad-
ministration seeks to reverse the toxic legacy of eight Bush 
years on America’s world standing.
We don’t hear much about Kashmir these days. Yet, 
like the tip of the iceberg, it is the visible reminder of a 
much larger problem. The Partition of British India in 
1947 displaced about 12 million people, spawned violence that killed hundreds of thousands and left a psychologi-cal legacy of distrust, animosity and unhealed trauma in 
both India and Pakistan that has only grown worse over 
the decades.
Kashmir got caught in the crossfire of Partition and re-
mains so today. In the last 60 years, it has been the focal point of bitter and dangerous Indo-Pak relations.
Like the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the Kashmir situa-
tion has defied endless attempts at solution and has bred increasing hatred, violence and seeming intractability. Yet, a solution is possible — and, I would suggest, ur-
gent.
Here is where President Barack Obama and Secretary 
of State Hillary Clinton can exercise the best of what we 
know of diplomacy. As long as the Pakistan military sees India as its greatest security challenge and posts most of 
its resources along that border, it cannot fully address the 
rising threat posed by the Taliban. Meanwhile, India re-jected including itself in Richard Holbrooke’s mandate as Special Envoy to the region and has consistently held that 
it can solve the Kashmir situation on its own.The world has spent decades 
dealing with the waste products 
of Partition. The U.S. would be 
wise to go to the root and use its 
power to engage the region in finally addressing the Kashmir conflict and healing the relation-
ship between the peoples of In-
dia and Pakistan. If France and 
Germany, which had been enemies for centuries through numerous wars, can turn that enmity into friendship after World War II, there is no reason why India and Pakistan 
can’t do the same.
With a nod of acknowledgement to those in Washing-
ton speaking for the need to integrate defense, develop-
ment, diplomacy and democracy, I’d like to suggest my 
own definition of smart power: using our resources to cre-
ate power with and power for, rather than power over or power against.
The Taliban are spreading across Afghanistan and now 
Pakistan. We’ve tried power over and against, with air at-
tacks and boots on the ground. Yet the Taliban only grow 
stronger.
If Pakistan, with its nuclear arsenal, falls under their 
control, we are rightly concerned about their penchant for 
power. Power with means putting our resources together 
with others in a cooperative, co-creative way.
Traditionally our resources have gone to the Pakistani 
government and military, and this obviously will and should continue, though sovereignty issues affect how 
much influence we can have on how this money is spent.We also have a solid United States Agency for Inter-
national Development presence in Pakistan, which could 
be strengthened to engage more with Pakistan’s relative-
ly strong civil society. Education is an especially critical 
need over the long term, both to reduce poverty and to empower people to take charge of their own destiny and resist tyranny.
I’m sure the AID team in Pakistan is doing a fine job; 
however, with no AID administrator appointed and no National Development Strategy yet in place, our efforts are not as full as they could be.
Consulting directly with a variety of unofficial players 
in the region should also be part of the plan.
Women’s groups, moderate religious leaders, coura-
geous human rights activists, democracy advocates, en-trepreneurs, educators and others in Afghanistan have a 
long history of dealing with the Taliban as do internation-
al relief and development agencies.
We can learn from their experiences, successes — and 
even failures — which might help their counterparts in Pakistan.
Our goal is to assist a strong, democratic nation of 
Pakistan that is politically and economically viable and can resist the influence of religious extremism and armed militancy spreading throughout the region.
These steps would serve the common good — both re-
gionally and globally — and go a long way toward weak-ening the ground under the power over approach of the Taliban, al-Qaeda and similar groups.

There’s an old adage: “Show me what 
you spend your money on, and I will tell you your values.”
President Barack Obama’s request for a 
“speedy” congressional vote on $83 billion more in supplemental war funds to pay for more troops, more drone bombing and 
even more carnage in Afghanistan, has in-
advertently shown his values in practice: war over diplomacy and wishful thinking over clear-eyed realism.
It’s time to get real on the United States 
military involvement in Afghanistan. Mili-tary engagement there since October 2001 has yielded neither the capture of Osama Bin Laden, the political defeat of the Tali-
ban, nor the improvement of life for Af-
ghans, especially Afghan women.
This war has cost U.S. citizens, thus far, 
more than $172.9 billion, according to the Congressional Research Service. 
The fiscal year 2009 budget deficit is 
now projected to be $1.75 trillion. Because it is borrowed money, the taxpayers — and our children — will have to pay it back.
This will be a burden on the U.S. econ-
omy for decades. Meanwhile, military cor-
porations such as DynCorp International, 
Triple Canopy and Halliburton are raking in profits.
Moving from the cost in monetary dol-
lars to the cost in blood, this military mis-adventure has claimed the lives of nearly 700 U.S. service members. 
Former Arizona Cardinals professional 
football player Pat Tillman, used as a Pen-
tagon poster boy until killed by “friendly” 
fire, is perhaps the only name of the dead of this war that Americans remember.
Nameless to us — but their deaths 
never to be forgotten or forgiven by their families — are thousands of Afghan civil-ian casualties.
Under Obama’s current policies, count-
less more young Americans and Afghan ci-
vilians will surely die for little to no gain.
Obama received a polite “no” from Eu-
ropean leaders to his request that North Atlantic Treaty 
O r g a n i z a t i o n forces take more 
of the combat load 
in Afghanistan. Large protests in France and Ger-
many marked the 
60th anniversary 
of NATO, which was created to protect Western Europe from the Soviet Union.
There is no Soviet Union any longer; 
Europe is economically powerful and peaceful and Afghanistan is a long, long way from the North Atlantic.
There are alternatives, far more afford-
able and rational, than accelerating the military option in one of the poorest and most war-torn countries on earth.
The U.S. could halt its military opera-
tions, especially the hated drone attacks 
in the Afghan-Pakistani border areas, and 
help organize a peace assembly led by widely respected Afghans, both men and women leaders.
The U.S. also has the ability to launch a 
regional diplomatic effort, including Rus-
sia, Iran, India, Pakistan and Central Asian 
states.
The American people are tired of war 
and sick of seeing their tax dollars go to 
bail out bankers and keep military con-
tractors in the black.
Afghanistan is not “the right war,” it’s 
a sinkhole for our lives and tax dollars and could be a disaster for the Obama 
presidency, which began with such over-
whelmning sense of optimism.
Diplomacy, a drawdown of military 
involvement and an exit strategy with a 
timeline — that’s the realistic path to free-
dom from endless war and debt.
This course of action would surely 
show the values that most Americans have come to support.

� LUGANO WAS LAID OFF 
BECAUSE OF BUDGET CUTS.
By THOMAS STEWART
Alligator Staff Writer
tstewart@alligator.org
Rose Lugano, a lecturer of Swa-
hili language and literature at UF 
who was laid off last year as a re-sult of budget cuts, was reinstated last week.
Lugano was scheduled to lose 
her job this summer. She challenged her layoff by filing a grievance with UF last July.
Paul D’Anieri, dean of the Col-
lege of Liberal Arts and Sciences, said UF reinstated Lugano because it decided she would help the uni-versity’s chances of securing a $2 million federal grant.
“We thought we’d be more 
competitive if we maintained the strength of that (African studies) program,” D’Anieri said. “Enroll-ment in the classes also is sufficient to justify continuing to teach them,” he said.
The four-year grant would net 
UF about $500,000 a year, said Leonardo Villalon, director of UF’s Center for African Studies.
UF currently 
receives the 
grant and will  reapply for it this fall, Villalon said. The grant 
is used to fund 
conferences and speakers, buy library materi-
als, develop new courses, hold fes-tivals and film viewings, fund the center’s performing arts program and pay teaching assistants, among other things, he said.
D’Anieri said Lugano’s rein-
statement means something else will have to be cut from the CLAS budget. It’s likely, he said, that the college will not be able to follow through on hiring a new faculty member.
Lugano was one of eight faculty 
and 66 staff who were laid off dur-ing the last round of cuts.
She is also the third professor 
to be reinstated this academic year, following the reinstatement of assis-tant professors Andrea Pham and Hana Filip in March. All three pro-fessors challenged their layoffs by filing grievances with UF. Pham’s layoff was overturned after an in-dependent arbitrator determined UF violated its layoff policy. Filip was reinstated less than a week lat-er because UF determined she was laid off for similar reasons.
Like Lugano, Pham and Filip 
taught language classes. 
D’Anieri said Lugano’s rein-
statement had nothing to do with the arbitrator’s decision in Pham’s case.
Lugano could not be reached for 
comment.

COLOMBO, Sri Lanka — Following 
more than a quarter-century of civil war, Sri 
Lanka faces the daunting task of trying to reconcile and rebuild after its troops routed the last Tamil Tiger separatist rebels Mon-
day and killed their feared leader.
One of the world’s most sophisticated 
insurgencies, the Tamil Tigers and their 
leader, Velupillai Prabhakaran (Ve-LU-pi-lay PRAH-bah-ka-ran), were brought down by a string of fatal misjudgments and an un-relenting government onslaught aimed at crushing the rebellion at all costs.
President Mahinda Rajapaksa, who plans 
to off declare victory Tuesday in a speech to parliament, has promised a power sharing deal with the Tamil minority. But the end of the war, which killed more than 70,000 people and displaced 265,000 others, could complicate efforts to forge a lasting peace.
The destruction of the rebels’ conven-
tional forces does not mean the threat is over. Insurgents hiding in the jungles of the 
east have emerged periodically to attack 
government forces and civilians, and the rebels had sleeper cells planted in Colombo and other towns.
The Tamil Tigers also retain a vast inter-national smuggling network and the finan-cial support of some of the 800,000 Tamil expatriates. At least one top rebel leader, Selvarasa Pathmanathan, the reputed smug-gling mastermind, remains at large.
“Now (there) is a historic opportunity, 
and hopefully things will change. But the demonstrable record so far is not particu-larly encouraging,” said Paikiasothy Sara-vanamuttu, a political analyst and execu-tive director of the Colombo-based Center for Policy Alternatives.
In Washington, State Department spokes-
man Ian Kelly said the U.S. is “relieved that the immense loss of life and killing of inno-cent civilians appears to be over,” and he urged Sri Lanka to build a tolerant society and help those hurt by the fighting.While Prabhakaran was a hero to some, his group was branded a terrorist organization by the United States and European Union.INTERNATIONALCivil war ends in Sri Lanka

MIAMI — A Haitian man was 
charged with human smuggling 
Monday after federal authorities ac-
cused him of piloting a boat over-
loaded with migrants that capsized off Florida’s coast, killing at least nine people, including a pregnant 
woman.
Jimmy Metellus, 33, is scheduled 
to appear in federal court Wednes-
day on charges of smuggling that caused the death of another person. 
Court records did not list an attorney 
for him Monday. A conviction could result in the death penalty or a life prison sentence.
Metellus, a Haitian citizen who 
also has permanent U.S. resident status, was among 16 people res-
cued when the boat capsized early 
last Wednesday off Boynton Beach, about 60 miles north of Miami. Most of the survivors — 15 Haitians and 
one Jamaican — will be 
deported to their home 
countries under U.S. policy.
U.S. Immigration 
and Customs Enforcement said the dead included two men, six women and an infant. Authorities also issued a separate death certificate for the pregnant woman’s 8-month-old un-
born fetus. Two women and a baby 
remained hospitalized Monday, and the other survivors were in immigra-tion custody. Five people are listed 
as missing.NewsStateA UF graduate student

n PARTICIPANTS PAID MORE THAN 
$1,000 EACH FOR THE CRUISE.

MIAMI — The little girls who made the 
New Kids on the Block a boy band sensa-
tion in the late 1980s and early 1990s are all 
grown up, and now they’ve got disposable 
income.
So what better way to show their love for 
Jordan, Jonathan, Joey, Donnie and Danny than spending three days with them on a Caribbean cruise?
About 2,100 women, most in their 20s 
and 30s, paid more than $1,000 each for a sold-out, three-day Carnival Cruise Lines 
trip that left Miami for the Bahamas on Fri-
day. The voyage kicks off the band’s sum-mer concert tour, when they’ll dust off hits like “Hangin’ Tough” and “Step by Step” along with songs from their 2008 album.
Fans squealed and giggled as they 
boarded the boat, angling for a glimpse of the New Kids. Some wore buttons and T-shirts with their favorite band members’ names and photos. Others kissed cardboard cutouts.
The band will perform twice during the 
trip, allowing half the passengers to come one night and the other half the next. Other events include meet and greets and photo ops.
Concert cruises provide a nice bump for 
Carnival, which recently lowered its earn-ings forecast because it’s had to slash prices to maintain its bookings. John Mayer and Lynyrd Skynyrd have done recent cruises 
and an upcoming voyage is Elvis-themed. 
Barenaked Ladies took its fifth “Ships & Dips” cruise with Norwegian Cruise Line in February.
Fans like the concert cruises because 
they’re “a more intimate experience than you would have in a typical stadium or concert venue,” said Cherie Weinstein, Car-nival’s vice president for business develop-
ment.
New Kids cruiser Shannon Wright, 32, of 
Syracuse, N.Y., was hoping to get up close 
and personal with her favorite New Kid, Donnie — as in Wahlberg, older brother of Mark Wahlberg, who started out as rapper Marky Mark and is now a respectable film actor — but said she’d probably faint when she did.
She might get the chance if she aces a 
poker tournament on the cruise itinerary for Sunday — the winners play Wahlberg at midnight.
Wright says her husband is “a little jeal-
ous of Donnie, but otherwise he’s OK with 
it.” She just got over seeing the group in 
concert a month ago, and now she’s got them cornered on a boat.
Emily Vance of Dayton, Ohio, took 
the cruise with her mother, Debbie King-ham, and friend Jenny Duncan. They wore matching black tour-branded tank tops and gushed about their favorite member — also Wahlberg, who was known as the “bad boy” of the group.Kingham and Vance remembered their 
first concert in July 1990. When Vance went to their reunion concert this October, she cried.
Vance and Duncan said their husbands 
think they’re crazy, but they don’t care.
“We’re the only ones who understand,” 
Duncan said.
After 20 years, band members say it’s 
flattering to still have screaming women at their feet.
The confined spaces of a boat make it 
harder to get away from obsessed fans, but 
they said they want to spend time with peo-
ple who are still loyal.
In between jokes about wearing Speedos 
on deck and making the entire boat break-fast, band members talked Friday about why they decided to continue performing.
“Our fans have come out since Day One, 
and we’ve just tried to answer the call,” said Joey McIntyre, at 36 the youngest member 
of the group. “It had to be fun and it had do 
be challenging, or we wouldn’t have done it.”

tour begins June 4 in Atlanta.NATIONAL

MIAMI — Florida will begin of-
fering rebates on energy-efficient 
appliances in an environmentally 
friendly attempt to boost sales un-
der a bill signed into law Monday.
Gov. Charlie Crist signed the 
bill, which gives rebates on ener-
gy-efficient appliances, such as 
washing machines, refrigerators, 
dishwashers and freezers. The program’s details, including how to qualify and how much a person 
could save, were not immediately 
outlined, but Crist’s office said 
consumers could save up to 20 per-cent per appliance on average.
“This rebate program will help 
Floridians buy appliances at dis-count rates, lower utility costs and benefit Florida businesses by stim-ulating sales of energy-efficient appliances,” Crist said in a news release after the bill signing in Or-lando.
The bill’s sponsor said at least 
$18 million in federal stimulus funds would go toward the pro-gram. The Legislature also allocat-ed $150,000 to the Florida Energy and Climate Commission, which will implement the rebate pro-
gram.
“We know exactly where the 
money’s going,” said Rep. Joseph 
Abruzzo, D-Wellington. “It is go-ing right back into the consumer’s 
pocket.”
Although an 
energy-efficient washing ma-chine costs about $1,000, com-pared to the $575 for a traditional 
machine, it saves 
about $600 in water and energy 
costs over its life span, according 
to data from the Federal Energy Management Program.
Maribel Balbin, water use ef-
ficiency manager for Miami-Dade 
County, said a similar rebate pro-
gram in the county was so popular that funding couldn’t meet the de-
mand. It was canceled in its second 
year. The first year, she planned 
for 150 rebates of $200 each and re-
ceived more than 800 applications.Crist OKs energy bill

ip was reinstated less than a week after UF decided the 
reasons for her layoff were similar.
Referring to these two cases, UF Provost Joe Glover 
told senators at Friday’s meeting that, though UF doesn’t have the ability to eliminate one language in a depart-
ment, he thinks it should have that right.
Paula Fussell, interim vice president for UF’s Human 
Resource Services, said the proposed changes clarified 
UF’s layoff rules and would give UF more curriculum control.
“If we have to make cuts, we wanna make sure that… 
we make them in the most strategic areas and we keep the things that are strategic to our future,” she said.
The changes, if passed, would not affect faculty in the 
faculty union, the United Faculty of Florida. Fussell said UF seeks a similar change in its contract with the union. John Biro, president of UF’s chapter of the union, said he couldn’t comment specifically on the proposed changes because of ongoing negotiations, but said, “Rules such as these proposed ones would not be acceptable to the 
faculty union.”
Proposed changes to UF’s layoff 
policies that are still on the table in-clude modifications to the manner in which staff can be laid off. Instead of only considering employment length at UF and performance evaluations, UF will now be able to consider other factors, like skill and education, Fus-sell said.
The changes are posted at regulations.ufl.edu, where 
they will be open for comment until May 27. The Board of Trustees, UF’s highest governing body, will vote on the changes, most likely in June.UF could factor skill, education into layoffs

al stimulus money will be used 
to plug some of the budget gap, but Machen maintained he will not use the money to 
cover cuts to recurring costs, 
like salaries, that must be paid every year. Instead, it will be used for transitional costs, like paying faculty salaries when they are in their notice period after being laid off.
It could also be used for en-
ergy-saving upgrades to build-
ings, he said after the meeting.
He said he has not allocated 
the entire $41 million that UF is 
expected to get this year from the stimulus package because he is still not sure exactly how it can be spent and because there is the possibility of an-other mid-year cut from the 
state Legislature, in which case 
he would like to have emer-gency money on hand.He said he expects the fed-
eral government to release the details about how the stimulus money can be spent later this month.
A few senators questioned 
Machen’s use of the stimulus money during Friday’s meet-ing.
“I… thought that the stim-
ulus money was specifically to avoid layoffs and was spe-cifically for job creation,” said Jane Brockmann, professor of biology. “It was to be used not to be set aside.”
Machen told her it is a re-
quirement that all of the stimu-lus money be used.
After the meeting, he said a 
few academic programs would be cut, accounting for about 2 percent of the total cut. 
Although he said UF plans 
to allow all students in termi-nated programs to finish their degrees, those programs will stop taking new students.72 faculty will be eliminated

In the United States’ oldest city, 
Florida’s oldest convent rests. Where 
many nuns of different Catholic orders 
once spread across the state in the mid 
1950s, only 78 remain from the Sisters of St. Joseph Convent. The women, whose influence stretched from Miami 
to Jacksonville from public schools to 
hospitals, now struggle to recruit new members to religious life. Only 18 sisters live in the Motherhouse in St. Augustine and 14 sisters live in the newly built at-
tached retirement complex, Lourdes 
Hall. Walking through the living facili-ties, all the essential amenities exist for the women who have spent their lives in service of God and the Roman Catholic 
Church.
Some of the elderly sisters choose 
to spend their time in the crafts room 
making items to be sold for funding 
for the Catholic Church. Some sisters 
spend time outside in the enclosed gar-den areas. Some sit around after Mass, drinking tea and ginger ale in the dining room. And some sisters pray.
A small chapel located at the end of 
the hall acts as a refuge to sisters looking for answers on how to serve in their fi-nal years. Walkers remain outside of the holy chapel. Women, too feeble to kneel, 
bow their heads.
Despite their age and dwindling num-
bers, the Sisters of St. Joseph continue to 
impact the state of Florida. Whether by 
teaching music or teaching the blind, the 
sisters spend their days traveling from church to hospital to service projects, providing counsel, love and prayers.

� THE NO. 1 GATORS WILL HOST CALIFORNIA IN 
THIS WEEKEND’S SUPER REGIONAL.

Alligator Staff Writer

The Gators have shown their ability to make adjust-
ments and take over games all season. Sunday, that abil-
ity put them one step closer to the Women’s College 
World Series.
No. 1 UF (58-3) overcame three hitless innings and 
pulled away late for a 9-0 victory against Lehigh (38-18-
1) to win the Gainesville Regional and advance to the 
best-of-three Super Regionals.
UF will face California at home Saturday and Sun-
day, a rematch of last year’s Super Regional, which the 
Gators won in two games. Saturday night’s game will be on ESPN, while Sunday’s action will be on ESPN2. 
Lehigh pitcher Lisa Sweeney (23-10, 2.15 ERA) allowed 
only one baserunner in the first three innings Sunday, as shortstop Megan Bush walked to lead off the third. 
“You have to give her a lot of credit. She really did a 
good job of keeping our hits down,” left fielder Franc-esca Enea said. “But we just made some quality adjust-ments to come through and get the hits and runs we needed when we needed them.”
Sweeney’s unusual delivery threw the Gators off at 
the beginning of the game, as she moved very slowly after separating her hands. This caused the UF batters to move their weight toward their front foot early.
“When she was throwing, the timing was off, so you UF goes undefeated in run through NCAA Regional

UF took home a Southeastern Con-
ference track title last weekend, but 
the team’s gender might be a surprise.  
The unranked women’s track and field 
team ran away with its first SEC Out-door Championship in six years, and UF’s 
men’s and women’s teams combined for 
nine event victories at the four-day event 
hosted by UF at Percy Beard Track inside 
James G. Pressly Stadium.
The top-ranked UF men entered the 
meet as favorites to win the title but fell 
short finishing with 129 points to Arkan-
sas’ winning total of 141.
“These things don’t come easy, and this 
really shows what a great team we have,” 
UF head coach Mike Holloway said. “We 
push each other hard all season and that paid off this weekend.”
With 135.5 points, the Gators defeated 
No. 4 LSU and No. 12 Tennessee, the only other  teams to top100 points. Holloway knew going into the weekend that earning points from both his track and field ath-
letes would be vital to win the championship.
“We are a very bal-
anced group, and that shows a lot about our 
program,” Holloway said. “If you want to be a national championship team, you need that bal-
ance.”
The women’s team also claimed five of 
the nine individual championships. Junior Evelien Dekkers won the women’s jav-elin, junior Mariam Kevkhishvili won the Women crowned SEC Champs

While the postseason was in full 
swing for the UF softball and track and 
field teams nearby, the Gators were 
busy cementing their position for the start of their own postseason run to-ward Omaha, Neb., site of the College World Series.
The Gators clinched the Southeastern 
Conference East Division title on Friday, which automatically earned them the No. 2 seed in this week’s SEC Tourna-
ment.
UF will open tournament play 
Wednesday at 11 a.m. against Arkansas 
in Hoover, Ala., in the first game of the double-elimination tournament. 
After splitting the first two games 
with Kentucky (28-26, 12-18 SEC), No. 13 UF took the final game of the series Saturday by a score of 13-9, giving the Gators momentum as they head into the postseason.
“I’ve always said that the first two (games) are really important, but that 
last one really sets the tone for the rest of 
the week,” UF coach Kevin O’Sullivan said. “So obviously we feel a lot better going into Hoover.”
After an early exit in last year’s con-
ference tournament — UF went home on the second day after losing its first two — the Gators (38-18, 19-11 SEC) hope that this season will be different 
but know it won’t be easy.
“This by far will be the toughest 
tournament we will play until we hope-
fully get the chance to go to Omaha,” O’Sullivan said.UF BASEBALLGators win SEC East

Even though Kevkhishvili’s 
winning throw of 59-2.75/18.05m 
was a personal best, set a new SEC record and was the top throw in the country this season, she feels she can do better.
“I think I did all right this 
weekend, but I know I can do better then what I did,” she said. “I will be ready for regionals in a few weeks.”
Men’s junior sprinter Calvin 
Smith was awarded with the Commissioner’s Trophy, which is awarded to the high-points scorer from the championships. Smith, who had 22 points, earned two SEC championship titles in the 400-meter dash as well as partici-pating in the winning 4x100-me-ter relay team with Jeremy Hall, Terrell Wilks and Jeff Demps.
The 4x100-meter relay team 
won UF’s first SEC title in that event with a time of 38.74 sec-onds, the third-fastest time in school history. Hall, a winner in the men’s 200-meter dash, ran the 100-meter dash in 10.08 sec-onds, finishing second to LSU’s Trindon Holliday who finished with a new track record of 10.01 seconds. Demps, who also ran against Hall and Holliday, fin-ished in ninth place after pulling his hamstring. Demps, who had a similar injury following the Penn Relays in late April, was helped off the track by trainers and is being evaluated. Freshman Gray Horn won the men’s decathlon on Saturday, setting another re-cord for UF by earning the school its first decathlon victory. Horn 
edged out Michael Ayers of Ten-
nessee with 7,389 points, ending Tennessee’s four-year winning streak in the event.
“It hasn’t sunk in yet, and I 
doubt it will sink in for a very long time,” Horn said after his victory Saturday. “This is some-thing I’ve dreamed about for my entire life.”
Next up for the men’s and 
women’s teams is a trip to Greensboro, N.C., to participate in the NCAA East Regional on May 29-30.
“We can’t let this win take our 
focus away from NCAA competi-tions later this season,” Holloway said.think you have to wait,” UF coach Tim Walton said. 
“By the time you wait, you’ve waited too long, and 
you’re popping it up and missing it. So we did a 
good job moving back in the batter’s box, giving us more starting time.”
The Gators made the necessary changes in the 
fourth, as catcher Kristina Hilberth led off with a 
double to center field. Two batters later, Enea drove 
in Hilberth with a double to center of her own.  Right fielder Kelsey Bruder, who led the team with three hits and five RBIs, knocked a single to right field to 
drive in Enea, giving the Gators a 2-run lead.
“She was mixing it up really well, so my ap-
proach was just to sit back,” Bruder said. “She was 
mixing in her changeup, too, so you had to have a good balance the whole way through.”
In addition to their adjustments at the plate, the 
Gators also made some adjustments in the circle.
Pitcher Stacey Nelson (37-3, 0.43 ERA), who 
promised to give up fewer hits than the nine she 
allowed  Texas A&M in UF’s 7-1 victory Saturday, 
lived up to her word. Nelson only allowed three on the day — one in each of the first three innings.
“She started throwing some changeups early in 
the game, and that probably wasn’t the adjustment 
we needed to make,” Walton said. “So we went more to her screwball, curveball and dropball. She 
started to really tie their hands and became harder to hit after the first few innings.”
On Saturday, the Gators scored 1 run in each of 
the first two innings, but the Aggies pulled to with-in 1 in the top of the fifth. UF responded  with 2 runs in the bottom of the inning and 3 more in the sixth to defeat Texas A&M, which had knocked the 
Gators out of the postseason the last two years.
“If they score, we want to come 
back and start chipping away,” said Hilberth, who led the team 
with 3 runs Saturday, 2 of which 
came after Texas A&M scored. 
“We’ve been fortunate to string some hits together in the last few 
games when they’ve scored. We’ve been able to an-swer back with the same amount or more.”
The Gators had no need to make adjustments or 
come back Friday night, as they took down Florida A&M in a five-inning, 12-0 victory to start the re-
gional off on the right foot.
“We needed to start out with a win,” said pitcher 
Stephanie Brombacher, who got her 21st win of the 
season in the opener.  “One win rolls into another, 
and we’ll take that momentum into the next game 
and in to super regionals.”

UF freshman Gray Horn clears the bar during the pole vault portion 
of the decathlon on Friday during the SEC Outdoor Championships.
It’s the middle  of May in Gainesville, which means a few 
things.
First, the classes students are skipping are now over an 
hour long. Second, the daily forecasts for the next two months predict unbearably hot days and late-afternoon rain. 
Third, football season is three months away, so people are 
desperate for any story even remotely related to college foot-ball.
So when ESPN had a slow news day, it dragged out an 
old story about Urban Meyer’s alleged feud with former UF quarterback and radio host Shane Matthews and slapped a sensationalist headline (“Meyer: Ex-Gators either with us or 
against us”) on it. Analysts and news outlets made a much bigger 
deal of the story than it deserved.
Matthews reportedly criticized 
UF’s offense after the 31-30 loss to 
Mississippi. I thought Matthews was just doing his job by pointing out a flaw in the offensive game-plan when an incredibly talented team lost a game it should have won. Professional analysts are still 
paid to analyze the sports they 
watch, aren’t they?
At a recent Gator Club appearance, Meyer’s comments 
drew a lot of unwarranted attention. 
“If you want to be critical of a player on our team or a 
coach on our team you can buy a ticket for seat 37F, you’re not welcome back in the football office,” Meyer said, accord-ing to the Orlando Sentinel. “You’re either a Gator or you’re not a Gator.”
Matthews has since said that he is shocked at how over-
blown this story was and that he and Meyer have cleared the air.
So that was UF’s football drama for the summer, right?Wrong.When Steve Spurrier went on a radio show and turned the 
rumor mill with talk of Meyer leaving UF for Notre Dame, people started clamoring for more and looking at it as more than what it was: a rumor.
Meyer wisely squashed it as quickly as possible, denying 
the rumor to the Gainesville Sun on Friday.
“I didn’t know what (Spurrier) was getting at,” Meyer 
said. “Here’s a quote for you: I am not going to Notre Dame. There’s gotta be something else going on in sports. Isn’t there car racing going on?”
While I don’t know a whole lot about car racing, there are 
plenty of other sports still active at UF. As a matter of fact, Meyer himself even Twitters about some of the teams.
(I know, I know. The verb is technically to tweet, but I re-
fuse to recognize that, much like I refuse to believe that Meyer actually follows, say, the softball team enough to write 140 
characters about it.)
Last weekend, five UF teams were in action, four of which 
were in postseason play and three of which competed in 
Gainesville. 
The No. 1 UF softball team spent the weekend breezing 
through the NCAA Regional in its home stadium. The Gators will stay in town next weekend for a rematch of last year’s Su-per Regional against California to vie for a bid in the Women’s College World Series. When the Gators are competing for a 
national title in Oklahoma City next week, you don’t want to 
be the uninformed “fan” who just started following the team, do you?
Also keep an eye on the track-and-field teams. The wom-
en’s team finished first and the men, who came into the meet ranked No. 1 in the nation, took second at the Southeastern 
Conference Outdoor Championships this weekend. Both 
teams will compete through June.
The baseball team earned the No. 2 seed in the SEC Tour-
nament starting Wednesday. UF will likely host an NCAA regional, which starts May 29.  The men’s golf team already grabbed a spot in the NCAA Tournament starting May 27, in Toledo, Ohio, by winning the Southwest Regional over the weekend. Led by a group of upperclassmen, this team is still hungry heading into its final tournament.
So there you go, four UF teams still in contention for a na-
tional championship. Ignore the sensationalist headlines, get off the football message boards and start following some of these less publicized sports.

trAck , from page 19Earlier in the season, UF was swept by its first opponent, 
Arkansas, but freshman first baseman Preston Tucker feels the 
team has changed since then.
“We had a completely different team and makeup back 
then,” Tucker said. “I think we can come out with a lot more 
confidence than the last time we played there because that was 
our first SEC road series.”
He believes the first series between the two teams will give 
the team extra motivation.
“We are excited to play them because they beat us in the last 
series,” Tucker said.
It was Senior Day on Saturday, but a freshman stole the 
show for the Gators.
UF scored early on Saturday to grab a 4-1 advantage, but 
Kentucky used a big fifth inning to take a temporary 5-4 lead.
After attempting to steal third base, Daniel Pigott jammed 
his finger, opening the door for freshman Tyler Thompson.
In the Gators’ half of the fifth inning, Thompson hit his first 
career home run to deep center field and drove in 2 runs.
“In my first at-bat I was sitting on a curveball, and he gave 
me a fastball,” Thompson said. “So then I just sat on a fastball the second time and he gave it to me.”
He finished 4 for 4 with three RBIs and 3 runs scored.“I’m seeing the ball really well right now,” Thompson said. 
“I think it was two games ago that I started seeing the ball a lot 
better.”
But the lead changes continued, as Kentucky scored 3 runs in 
the sixth inning. However, UF broke the game open in the sev-
enth and scored 4 runs with two outs. Shortstop Mike Mooney singled up the middle to drive in the first two, and the next bat-ter, Tucker, doubled to knock in another two runners.
After that, the Gators never looked back, as freshman Alex 
Panteliodis earned the win after coming out of the bullpen and pitching 1.1 scoreless innings.Thompson hits 2-run bomb to lead Gators to series-clinching win SaturdayTUESDAY, MAY 19, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 21

The No. 15 UF women’s tennis team’s 
season ended with a 4-2 loss to No. 2 Geor-
gia in the Sweet 16  of the NCAA Tennis 
Championships on Friday.
It was the third meeting this spring be-
tween the Southeastern Conference rivals, and the upset-minded Gators struggled in 
doubles before giving the Bulldogs all they 
could handle in College Station, Texas.
The exit could easily be labeled as 
heartbreaking, but these players’ spirits 
couldn’t be shattered.
UF coach Roland Thornqvist was aware 
of who his team was facing after splitting a pair of close dual matches. Georgia was 
what he thought it was.
“We knew we were playing a team that 
was picked to be a favorite for the nation-al championship,” Thornqvist said. “We were probably underdogs in most of the spots. We all felt that we had a chance.” 
The Gators (16-10) gave up the pivotal 
doubles point and Brooke Allen’s No. 6 singles match to find themselves in a 2-0 hole. Freshman Jessica Alexander scored the first point for UF by defeating No. 93 Monika Dancevic 6-4, 6-1.
The eighth- and ninth-ranked players 
slugged it out for three sets on Court 1, but UF’s Marrit Boonstra fell to Chelsey Gullickson 6-3, 2-6, 6-3, putting Georgia in the position of needing one more win to advance to the Elite 8.
Jo Mather stalled a Bulldogs’ celebra-
tion with a 4-6, 6-2, 6-2 win over No. 56 Nadja Gilchrist.
With No. 40 Anastasia Revzina locked 
in a third set with No. 55 Yvette Hyndman, Barbara Pinterova reached a second-set tie-breaker against Naoko Ueshima, who has beaten the freshman in two of the last three 
matches they’ve played against each other.
Though Pinterova 
got off to a quick 5-1 start, Ueshima was able to thwart the attack and even the score. Ueshima 
eventually took the tiebreaker and the match 6-3, 7-6 (2), clinching the win for Georgia (27-2).
Revzina and Hyndman did not finish.“All the credit to our players, because 
they fought back and gave us a chance,” Thornqvist said.
“I felt that we did what we could and fought as hard as we could,” he said, “but they were certainly the better team to-day.” 
SINGLES AND DOUBLES UPDATE: The cham-
pionships aren’t over for eight UF players. The men’s and women’s teams will each be represented in the singles and doubles draws, with singles beginning today.
Boonstra and Revzina will compete in 
the women’s first round. No. 23 Carlos Cueto and No. 33 Alex Lacroix will play on the men’s side. The second round is Wednesday. 
Doubles play opens on Wednesday. 
The women’s No. 1 (No. 18 Boonstra and Mather) and No. 2 (No. 25 Alexander and Revzina) teams are in action along with the 
men’s No. 1 doubles team (No. 25 Antoine 
Benneteau and Joey Burkhardt.)

JUMPBALL
Forgive the man whose writing appears to the right of mine.
His apparent lack of understanding 
of horse racing tradition has left McCall-in’ It Like I See It on the wrong side of this ar-gument.
See, the three legs of the Triple Crown 
are each a different length.  
And for good reason.The Derby is a mile-and-a-quarter.The Preakness is a mile-and-three-six-
teenths.
The Belmont is a mile-and-a-half. It may not seem like much of a variation, 
but in horse racing such differences abso-lutely mean the difference between winning and falling short.
Exhibit A was Saturday’s Preakness 
Stakes when Borel aboard Rachel Alexan-dra beat out 50-to-1 Derby winner Mine That Bird by a single length.
If the Preakness is 
a sixteenth-of-a-mile longer (thereby mak-ing it equal to the Derby), we’re talking about Mine That Bird 
winning the both races with different jock-ys. So how much does Borel count for?
Because when a horse wins all three, it is 
a true measure of its across-the-board supe-riority.  That’s why only 11 horses have ever done it and none since Affirmed in 1978.
In the 31 years since, 11 horses have won 
the Derby and Preakness before falling short in the Belmont. Let’s call it the Calvin Crown. Or may-
be the Borel Blitz.
Whatever you want to call it, Cal-
vin Borel should be recognized for pulling 
off a feat even more impressive than just winning a Triple Crown if he’s able to ride 
Rachel Alexandra to a win at the Belmont 
Stakes on June 6.
Hard-line, traditional horse racing fans 
like Phil will say that winning the three 
races doesn’t count as a Triple Crown if it 
isn’t done on the same horse. 
To me, what Borel is doing is better.
Usually, horses that win or come close 
to winning the Triple Crown are the best in the field, and Borel hasn’t had that luxury. 
He took a 50-to-1 longshot, Mine That 
Bird, to a Kentucky Derby victory before saddling up a filly and taking the Preak-ness Stakes.
Borel has taken 
two different horses to the Winner’s Cir-cle in as many races, beating out the best 
riders and horses the 
sport has to offer. 
He’s the common 
denominator in the 
two races so far, and 
if he adds another win in the Belmont, he’ll 
disprove the notion that jockeys are unim-
portant.
Without a good jockey, even the best of 
horses will lose. 
With Borel on board, it looks like any 
horse can win, and he should be honored for that.Which is more impressive: a possible Borel Triple or the conventional one?

If the regionals were any indication, the 
Gators deal well with pressure.
“The pressure we feel is to win,” senior Billy 
Horschel said before the NCAA Southwest Re-
gional.
The No. 8 UF men’s golf team lived up to 
Horschel’s words by winning the event in Aus-tin, Texas, its first tournament victory away from home since 2006. The team finished the weekend at 22 over par, just two shots ahead of 
second-place Texas Tech.
The Gators entered Saturday’s final round 
in third place, four shots out of first place. But 
UF was able to ride Horschel’s final round of 3 
under par to victory and an NCAA Champion-
ship berth.
“This win was huge not just for our seniors 
but for the whole team,” he said. “It was big for our confidence, and mentally it was key that 
we got this win before nationals.”
The final day of the event was particularly 
tough for the teams due to inclement weather.
“We had about a two-hour rain delay, and 
it was very windy and rainy,” Horschel said. 
“But we were still able to get the job done.”
He finished with a score of 1 over par for 
the event, good for the second-best individual score of the weekend.
While Horschel was the hero for the Gators 
on the final day, a different golfer stepped up for UF in each round.
On the second day of the tournament, it was 
junior Tyson Alexander’s round of 3 under par that helped the team stay in contention for first place. He finished the event with a score of 4 
over par.
“This week, we didn’t play awesome golf, 
but we played solid enough,” Horschel said. 
“Everyone played good.”
But if the Gators are going to have success 
in college golf’s biggest tournament, they will need improved play from arguably their sec-ond-best golfer, junior Tim McKenney. While he had a solid second round of even par, he 
struggled the other two days and finished 12 
over par. In his previous two events, he is a combined 28 over par.
“His confidence is a little shaky right now, 
but we just got to get him playing well,” Horschel said. “He was close this weekend, so 
hopefully in nationals he can play well.”
The NCAA Championships will not start 
until May 27, but UF is ready to make a run 
for the title.
“It’s always exciting when you get the op-
portunity to play for a national championship,” Horschel said. “You have to be excited.”UF MEN’S GOLFGators win NCAA Regional

Stan Van Gundy really can’t catch a 
break lately.
It’s tough enough being known as 
former Knicks and Rockets coach Jeff Van Gundy’s Ron Jeremy look-alike brother, but lately Stan has fallen victim to the heat-of-the-moment comments of his star player as well as the fickle media and pub-lic opinion. 
When the NBA Playoffs started just one 
month ago, SVG was among the front run-ners to receive the NBA Coach of the Year Award after guiding the Orlando Magic to a 59-23 record and the No. 3 seed in the Eastern Conference. 
Now the Magic are set to square off 
with LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Eastern Conference Finals after holding off the Philadelphia 76ers in the first round and defeating the Boston Celtics in the second round. 
Sunday’s Game 7 victory in Boston was 
the franchise’s greatest accomplishment since the Shaq and Lil’ Penny era ended a decade ago. 
Despite the copious amount of success 
Stan and the Magic have enjoyed in the past 30 days, it seems Lil Ron’s coaching ability has greatly diminished over the course of this playoff run — at least in the eyes of Dwight Howard and some media members. 
After the Magic blew a 14-point fourth-
quarter lead to the C’s in Game 5 and fell behind 3-2 in the series, Howard was ex-tremely blunt in describing the shortcom-ings of his coach’s game plan. 
“I would just say it’s tough to win all 
season when you play inside-out with people who got you off to a good season. I think I’m capable of scoring in the post,” Howard said after the loss. “I don’t want to say it’s all about offense. 
“But when you have a dominant player, 
let him be dominant.”
The dominant player Howard was re-
ferring to was, of course, himself, and multiple members of the media, such as ESPN’s Tony Kornheiser and Michael Wil-bon agreed with the 23-year-old center. 
SportsCenter has even made it a habit 
to refer to Stan as “The Master of Panic,” a nickname Shaq gave him after Van Gundy correctly and unapologetically called the Big Aristotle a “flopper” after a regular season game with O’Neal’s Suns. 
Ironically, the media is using Howard’s 
comments as evidence of said panic even though SVG called out Shaq for flopping against Howard.
Howard, who averaged 20.6 points per 
game in the regular season, felt as though he didn’t get enough touches down the stretch of Game 5 and finished the game with 12 points on 10 field-goal attempts. 
Ten shots seems like a drop in the bucket 
for a “dominant player,” but Howard av-eraged just over 12 field-goal attempts per contest during his 79 regular-season games. If a statistician were to make a graph of his shot attempts, 10 would hardly be an outlier. 
A more well-
kept secret, however, is that 
while Howard is perhaps the most domi-nant rebounder and shot blocker in the NBA today, he is not a dominant offensive 
player. 
He has never averaged as many as 21 
points per game over the course of a regu-lar season, and 17 other players averaged more points per contest in 2008-09, includ-ing Ben Gordon and David West. 
Despite all those facts, Stan Van Gundy 
found himself under fire for not feeding the ball to a sub-60-percent free-throw shooter at the end of a tight battle. 
Though not as beloved by the Magic 
faithful, forwards Hedo Turkoglu and Rashard Lewis shoot better than 80 per-cent from the charity stripe and are much better options at the end of close games. 
“I have to do it defensively where I have 
to be more aggressive, and offensively I have to get the ball,” Dwight said. “I don’t think you are going to win a lot of games when your post player only gets 10 shots. It’s tough to get yourself going and get a lot of shots without a lot of touches. We have to do a better job with that.”
One might argue that you could win at 
least 67 games with a similar game plan and that SVG made his case for Coach of the Year with a similar game plan. 
Honestly, I don’t blame Howard for 
saying the things he did. 
It was a tough loss, and he felt he wasn’t 
given a fair opportunity to help his team win the game. 
I do, however, blame any media and 
fans who quickly turned on a coach with a proven track record in multiple NBA cities (Orlando and Miami). 
Houston Rockets general manager 
Daryl Morey recently said on ESPN col-umnist Bill Simmons’ podcast that he, in fact, cast his Coach of the Year ballot for Van Gundy.
In sharp contrast, Orlando Sentinel col-
umnist Mike Bianchi recently wrote a col-umn saying that the post-game criticism might even affect Stan’s job security.
Could you imagine the NBA Coach of 
the Year being fired had the Celtics been able to defend their home court? 
The coaching profession is one with 
quick turnarounds, knee-jerk hires and fires and brutally fickle job security. 
But of course Stan already knows that; 
he is, of course, the brother of Jeff.

after Kornheiser leaves

AN AUG. 13 PRESEASON GAME.

Monday Night Football tried a Cow-
boy, a comic, a columnist and a Cosell. 
To fill the latest vacancy in the broadcast booth, ESPN went with a winning formu-la — a coach, and a Super Bowl champion 
at that.
Fresh off getting fired by the Tampa 
Bay Buccaneers, Jon Gruden was hired to 
replace Tony Kornheiser this season.
The snarl-for-snarky swap came after 
Kornheiser cited a fear of flying in his de-cision to leave after three years. The same fear beset one of the most popular MNF announcers ever, John Madden, who re-
tired from his TV career last month.
Gruden has spent his entire adult life 
coaching football, and said this job would 
give him an “opportunity to see things from a different angle.”
“Kind of like it’s halftime of my life,” 
the 45-year-old Gruden said Monday on a conference call. “Unfortunately, I don’t know many things about other aspects of 
life.”
Neither he nor Norby Williamson, 
ESPN’s executive vice president of pro-
duction, would directly answer how long Gruden’s contract lasts, or whether he was free to leave for an NFL post if one is offered.
“Maybe I can hang in and keep this job 
for a while,” Gruden said, later adding, “I dearly miss coaching.”
Gruden will join Mike Tirico and Ron 
Jaworski when the show starts its 40th season this fall. Gruden will make his debut at a preseason game on Aug. 13, a matchup between the Arizona Cardinals and Pittsburgh Steelers.
Gruden recalled watching in the days 
when Howard Cosell and Don Meredith shared the booth, and comedian Dennis Miller’s stint led to Kornheiser’s run.
Kornheiser will continue to appear on 
ESPN’s “Pardon the Interruption.”
“My fear of planes is legendary and 
sadly true,” he said in a statement re-leased by the network. “When I looked at the upcoming schedule, it was the perfect storm that would’ve frequently moved me from the bus to the air.”
“If I could handpick a replacement of 
a football guy, I would cast a net and drag in Jon Gruden,” he said. “He is the two 
things you most want — smart and funny 
— and has the two things I don’t — good hair and a tan.”
Williamson emphasized it was Korn-
heiser’s choice to leave, and said MNF did not consider trying to replace him with a nonfootball type.
“We were talking to Jon, he was out 
there,” Williamson said. “When Tony 
made his decision, Jon was the guy.”
Nicknamed “Chucky” for his strik-
ing resemblance to the horror film doll, 
Gruden said he felt he’d be able to mix the right blend of criticism, razzing and praise. He has been a vocal critic of ESPN in the past, specifically objecting to anon-ymously sourced reports by the network.
“I don’t watch ESPN,” he said in 2007. 
“These reports make me sick, really.”
“There’s a lot of reports out there,” 
Gruden said. “I just wish some of these reports were verified.”
Asked his favorite memory of MNF, 
Gruden immediately hummed the open-ing notes to the show’s theme song. He recalled being young, trying to persuade his mom and dad to let him stay awake to watch the games end.
