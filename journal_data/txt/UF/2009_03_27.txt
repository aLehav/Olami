The College of Medicine released their 10 per-
cent budget cut proposal late Wednesday, which 
would cut about $3.8 million and result in the lay-
offs of seven faculty and staff positions, according to UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes.
Other proposals were also obtained Thursday, 
including the College of Design, 
Construction & Planning, the College of Journalism and the College of Dentistry.
In the College of Medicine’s 
proposal, two of the laid off em-ployees have secured other jobs with the college, Sikes said.
Twenty-eight positions that 
will be vacant will be left un-
filled, saving more than $2 million.
The proposal will also reduce funding for some 
research programs and delay the roll out of a can-
cer program, Sikes said.
The plan will have no effect on enrollment, she 
said.
The College of Design, Construction & Plan-
ning proposal will cut about $985,000 and would 
involve the layoffs of about six temporary faculty members and four faculty members who would not be eligible for tenure, Sikes wrote in an e-mail.
The plan would also eliminate two vacant staff 
positions, she wrote.More colleges

Questions have arisen recently over the 
payment of millions of dollars in bonuses and 
incentives to College of Medicine faculty while budget cuts threaten the jobs of dozens of em-ployees and academic programs at UF.
An e-mail sent by Bruce Kone, former dean 
of the College of Medicine, to faculty in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences who could see their departments slashed substantially in 
the next round of cuts, calls attention to the bo-
nuses and accuses UF of not doing all it can to protect departments from crippling cuts. “The idea that UF doesn’t have enough 
money to continue support for you is prepos-
terous,” he wrote. 
UF records show 
that, last year, hun-
dreds of College of 
Medicine faculty were paid about $7.6 million 
in bonuses and incentives, down from about $9.2 million the previous year.
The awards amount to about 1.3 percent of 
the college’s total budget in 2007-2008, which was about $550 million.
“Makes AIG seem paltry,” Kone wrote in 
his e-mail, referring to the $165 million in bo-Medical school irate over faculty bonuses

Smokers will have yet another incentive to 
kick the habit after an April 1 tax increase, and local retailers are bracing themselves for the effects.  The federal excise tax will increase for small cigarettes from 39 cents to $1.01 per pack 
and from $3.90 to $10.07 per carton, according 
to the U. S. Department of the Treasury’s Alco-hol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau’s Web site.
Jimi Hiley, a tobacconist at Modern Age 
Tobacco & Gift Shop on West University Av-enue, said he doesn’t expect to see a large drop 
in sales because of the increase. 
Hiley said he believes raising the price of 
tobacco is not an effective means of getting 
people to quit and stop buying tobacco, al-though some customers have complained. 
“It does affect businesses on some level,” he said. “I mean some people are saying ‘you 
may have priced me out of my habit.’ I think 
that’s a horrible way to get someone to quit.”

Three arrested for stealing $5K from store
A Gainesville Wal-Mart Supercenter em-
ployee and two other people were arrested 
Wednesday after being accused of stealing almost $5,000 from the store.
Niki Sessions, 34, Erica Harden, 31, and 
Karim Livingston, 32, have been charged with grand theft and scheme to defraud and obtain property.
According to the Gainesville Police De-
partment arrest report, since Jan. 31, Harden and Livingston bought items at the cash regis-ter Sessions worked at and paid in cash.
Sessions would give them hundreds of 
dollars in change, more than was due to them, and caused the cash register’s total amount of money to come up short, the report stated.
This happened 11 times with the amount 
of money taken totaling $4,959.44.
When arrested, Sessions said he gave 
Harden and Livingston money because he was mad at Wal-Mart and trying to retaliate because the store hadn’t given him a bonus.

It took one sentence to lay her off and one 
more to reinstate her.
UF assistant professor of Czech stud-
ies Hana Filip received a one-sentence letter 
Wednesday notifying her that she had her 
job back, becoming the second professor this week to be reinstated. 
“The University of Florida hereby with-
draws its layoff notice dated June 9, 2008,” the letter, signed by UF Provost Joe Glover, reads.
“Now it’s funny,” Filip said of the terse let-
ters. “But, believe me, it was not funny until yesterday.”
Filip was scheduled to lose her job in June 
as a result of the $6 million budget cut experi-enced by the College of Liberal Arts and Sci-ences in 2008-2009. Her layoff was challenged 
by the United Faculty of Florida, the UF fac-
ulty union, and an arbitration hearing was set for April 21, Filip said.
UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes said UF de-
cided to reverse Filip’s layoff before the hear-ing because of an arbitrator’s ruling in a simi-lar case, heard in January and decided earlier this month.
Andrea Pham, assistant professor of lin-
guistics and Vietnamese language, who was laid off around the same time as Filip, was or-dered to be reinstated on the grounds that UF violated its contract with the faculty union. 
The ruling states UF can 
only target organizational units such as departments 
for layoffs, and that Pham’s 
two Vietnamese classes did not constitute such a unit, as UF contended.
 “I did not expect it,” Fil-
ip said of UF’s decision. “It was a good surprise.”
“I’m just hugely relieved that I can go back 
and just do my work,” she said. She said she 
hasn’t been told yet what she’ll be teaching 
next year. Paul D’Anieri, dean of  CLAS, wrote in an e-mail that he will talk with the heads of the programs in which Filip teaches to decide that in the coming days. More classes will like-ly be added to the schedule soon, he wrote.
He also wrote that he wasn’t sure where 
the money to reinstate Filip will come from. The college is currently preparing for a pos-sible cut of about $9.3 million. “We’ll need to identify deeper cuts in order to pay for these unanticipated expenses,” D’Anieri wrote.
Filip said she has mixed feelings about the 
experience of being laid off then reinstated.
“On the one hand, I am grateful for all 
the support from the faculty here but, on the 
other hand, it was a huge trauma I was put 
through,” she said.UF ADMINISTRATIONProfessor returns after union challenges her layoff

WASHINGTON — Confront-
ing an inherited and faltering war, President Barack Obama plans to dispatch thousands more military 
and civilian trainers to Afghanistan 
by the fall on top of the 17,000 com-bat troops he has already ordered, senior administration officials said Thursday.
Obama’s war strategy, which he 
will announce on Friday, includes no timeline for withdrawal of troops. The war began more than seven years ago.The sources said Obama’s 
goal is to stabilize Afghanistan and 
eliminate the terrorist havens that have taken root in Pakistan. They said the plan is built around bench-
marks that will al-low the president and Congress to check whether the 
investment of more U.S. people and 
aid is working.
Obama plans to send 4,000 more U.S. military troops whose mission 
will be to train and expand the Af-ghan army to take the lead on coun-terterrorism and counterinsurgency. The president also plans to send in hundreds more U.S. civilians to help the people of Afghanistan rebuild 
their nation.
More broadly, the new strategy links Afghanistan and Pakistan as 
one integrated challenge.
Obama will support legislation 
that aims to pump billions of dol-lars aid into Pakistan, considered to be the primary haven for terror-ists since U.S.-led forces toppled the 
Taliban government in Afghanistan 
in 2001.

Now Gainesville residents have more reason than ever to 
do business in Florida.
Gainesville Mayor Pegeen Hanrahan, alongside mayors 
across the state, joined Gov. Charlie Crist in support of a new 
strategy to boost local spending.
Everyone will have access to the Florida Backyard Card,  
which  offers discounts to those who shop at participating stores. Card users can get as much as $100 off nightly rates at a luxury resort, or 10 percent off guitar strings at Gainesville’s 
Hoggtowne Music, Inc.
People can get the cards for free at Florida 
Lotto retailers or online at FloridaBackyardCard.com.
“The revenues produced from dollars spent in our com-
munities pay for vital services such as roads, schools, police protection, fire service and public safety,” Hanrahan said in a press release.
The mayor did not immediately respond to phone calls for 
comment.
David Denslow, a UF economics professor, said this kind 
of incentive is similar to discount coupons at a grocery store. Those most likely to take advantage of it are those who are most price-sensitive. 
Additionally, since demand has decreased in the weak 
economy, coupons allow businesses to lower prices for select groups.
It’s a nice idea, Denslow said, but it might not be effective. “Maybe you eat out 11 times instead of 10. Maybe you 
switch spending away from things without coupons to things with coupons. It’s not going to have much impact on overall spending.”Mayor wants to

Losing City Commission candidates said they antici-
pate bright political futures, despite landslide victories 
by  incumbents in Tuesday’s Gainesville City Elections.
Although their platforms disagreed, candidates 
could agree that they learned from the campaign. 
“Oh, it was fantastic,” said Richard Selwach, candi-
date for At-Large seat 1. “Everybody’s really happy that I participated and gave people another choice,” he said, adding that business at his pawn shop increased due to the publicity.
“I have a line out the door,” he said. “I can’t buy this 
type of advertising.”
Selwach said he only received 6.19 percent of votes 
because the incumbents got more publicity and cam-
paign contributions. 
He said if there had been a primary, the results 
wouldn’t have been divided up between so many can-
didates. In that case, he said, there probably would have been a run-off between Jeanna Mastrodicasa, Robert Krames and himself.
District 1 Commissioner Scherwin Henry captured 
68.21 percent of votes, and At-Large Commissioner Jean-na Mastrodicasa received 58.13 percent of the votes.
“Even though I lost, I feel I did the best job out of 
all the candidates,” Selwach said, adding that his unique point of view made the debates more lively.
Selwach added that Mastrodicasa’s and Krames’ 
campaign contributions and his position as a conserva-tive libertarian made it difficult for him to win.
Selwach’s possible plans include running for District 
4 commissioner, where he lives, or for mayor if Craig Lowe, a city commissioner and leader of anti-Amend-
ment 1 group Equality is Gainesville’s Business, also 
decides to run. 
“Next year, there won’t be an incumbent,” he said.James Schlachta, who secured 4 percent of the At-
Large votes, said this was his first campaign.
“It was a great group of people running,” Schlachta 
said. “It was good to see more than two people running. We got to see more of a diverse group.”
Like Selwach, Schlachta credited financial contribu-
tions to Mastrodicasa and Krames as a big reason for their higher numbers.
“Jeanna and Robert were able to raise a lot more 
money, and that helped out a lot,” Schlachta said. 
Schlachta, who was pro-Amendment 1, said that he 
probably got a lower percentage of the votes because many people showed up at the polls primarily to oppose Charter Amendment 1, which would have eliminated the city ordinance titled “Discrimination.”
Although he has no definite plans, 
Schlachta said he may run for City Commission again.
Robert Krames, the runner-up for 
the At-Large seat with 25 percent of the votes, said he felt that each candidate was heartfelt and that he had no hard feelings toward the winners.
“I plan to stay involved, and I congratulate all the 
candidates on a race well-run,” Krames said. “They were all trying to make the world a better place, and I compliment them on that.”
Tom Cunilio, who earned 6.27 percent of At-Large 
seat votes, could not be reached for comment.
Considering it was her first time running for office in 
Gainesville and the fact that she has only been a resident for five years, Marcia Wimberly said getting almost 32 percent of the votes was wonderful.
“We had a great time. People were wonderful,” 
Wimberly said.
She also was impressed by the election’s high turn-
out.
“We almost tripled,” Wimberly said. “That’s a plus. 
That’s a big plus.”Losing local candidates discuss

Globalization is a tricky word, said au-
thor and visiting professor, Saskia Sassen 
Thursday night.While it implies the increased connec-
tion between people worldwide, it glazes 
over the complexity, Sassen said.
“The term is becoming an invitation not 
to think,” she said.
Sassen, a professor of sociology at Co-
lumbia University who is known for her 
study of international immigrants, is visit-
ing UF for a  European immigration work-
shop, which begins today at 9 a.m. in Dauer Hall and lasts until 5.15 p.m.
Her most recent book on the topic is “El-
ements for a Sociology of Globalization,” 
published by Norton.
Instead of just focusing on 
immigrants as  statistics, Sas-sen studies their circumstanc-
es, which she calls “spaces.”  Work is not 
the only thing that controls the movement 
of an immigrant, she said.“Spaces like this, your campus, have 
a geographic terrain, but they also have 
multiple worlds,” she said. “There are the 
worlds of the students, of the cleaners, of the professors.”
Sassen briefly applied this idea to the 
complexities of U.S.-Mexican immigration and by pointing out that roughly 3 million 
retired American citizens live in Mexico, of 
which only 1 million are documented.By CHELSEA KEENAN

Florida’s Board of Governors 
discussed upcoming slashes in the 
budget of Florida’s 11 public uni-versities and the happenings of Florida’s legislative session in the 
final meetings of a two-day session 
on Thursday. 
One of the hotter topics dis-
cussed was the differential tuition bill, which is being considered in the state Legislature and would al-low universities to raise tuition by up to 15 percent per year to reach the national average. 
“We have the lowest tuition fees 
in the country,” said Bill Edmonds, the board’s spokesman, after the meeting. “And we’re suffering 
because of that. We need extra re-
sources.”
Cuts to current resources were 
addressed in the final meeting, in-cluding the readjusted budget of the Public Education Capital Outlay, or PECO, which is money given every three years to Florida’s 11 public uni-versities to finance the construction of new classrooms or labs. The $649 million, which was distributed from 
PECO through-out the university 
system during the last cycle, has 
been reduced to 
$358 million.  Ed-monds said this cut reflects the state of Florida’s economy.  
“This is the steepest drop in 
PECO we’ve ever seen,” he said. This cut will have a direct impact 
on UF, as the $92.5 million the uni-versity has received in past years will be reduced to $11.9 million.
“It’s devastating,” said Ed Pop-
pell, vice president of Business Af-fairs at UF.
Poppell said any plans to start 
constructing new buildings on cam-pus will come to a halt for two to three years as a result. 
“We won’t be able to start build-
ing the new chemistry building or really do anything,” he said.
During a committee meeting the Florida Boots to Books Initia-tive was also addressed. This GI Bill, which was passed in the 2008 Congress and will take effect Au-gust 2009, provides for full tuition, housing and a $100,000 stipend for books to returning veterans who are 
heading to college.  
The board plans to prepare 
schools for the provisions of the 
new bill, ensuring campuses are ready for the influx of new students, said Ann Duncan, student affairs and campus life committee chair-woman.

Everyone loves a villain. Well, we like to hear about 
them, anyway.
There’s something magnetic about a character 
who thrives on mayhem. In “No Country for Old Men,” Javier Bardem’s character made taking lives seem as second-nature as blinking. The result of this maniac bringing his bloodshed to the big screen? An Academy Award for Best Picture and a bunch of nerds calling each other friend-o.
That was 2007, but conveniently enough, the past 
year has provided two more prime examples of this phenomenon.
Audiences nationwide were treated to the delightful-
ly sadistic and sloppily made-up Joker, courtesy of the late Heath Ledger, in last July’s “The Dark Knight.” The classic villain renewed my interest in magic within 30 minutes. I’m sure I wasn’t the only one in the audience grinning when the Joker made a No. 2 pencil disappear into Gangbanger No. 3’s eye socket. And we only use pencils for Scantrons and crosswords. Lame.
The rest of the movie featured the Joker (self-pro-
claimed agent of chaos) bombing, slicing and mind-fucking his way through Gotham City. Entertaining? Yes. Gruesome? A little. Predictable? Not even close — which is why we can’t get enough of it. The Joker was an unbelievable bastard, and the audience loved to hate him.
Fortunately for the movie-going public, such a ma-
niac was reserved solely for the big screen. We weren’t without our real-life villain, though, who was much less violent but equally as calculating. Cue Bernard Madoff, pilferer of savings. He doesn’t paint his face or sew his own purple suits, but he does rob bank accounts.Audiences did not respond well 
to Madoff’s grimy deeds (he even scammed Kevin Bacon!), and his 150-year prison sentence won’t provide much relief. You can’t steal from the guy who says he’s worked with everyone in Holly-wood and get away with it. If you piss him off, you’ve lost the whole West Coast. And if you lose Hol-
lywood, you lose tabloid readers, which mean you lose every American who’s ever been to the grocery store.
Congrats, Madoff. The entire U.S. population, which 
swears to a violent, Oscar-winning clown, is now pissed you only got 150 years for stealing other people’s mon-ey. This isn’t the fun kind of loathing Hunter S. Thomp-son taught us about. It isn’t the hatred we go to theaters for. No. This is you-stole-from-us-while-sipping-tea-in-our-living-room fury. You no longer have friends, Mr. Madoff. Most people are crossing their fingers that you spend the next century and a half with clones of Bogs from “The Shawshank Redemption.” 
If it’s any consolation, everyone is going to remem-
ber your name. Like I said, we love villains. It’s much easier to blame a name and a face for our problems than an abstract concept like the economy.
For now, Madoff’s name is going to appear in the 
headlines every time he does something other than tuck his tail between his legs. Like Ledger’s Joker, the pub-lic will continue to obsess over this bad guy, but there won’t be any praise or awards on the way.

Darts & Laurels
Leave it to the state of Florida for setting an all-time low by 
suspending a student from the school bus for a severe bout of flatulence. For making Jonathan Locke Jr. walk to school simply because he fancies himself some beans, the Department of Darts & Laurels chucks a we-LOL’d-when-we-heard-the-bus-driver-couldn’t-breathe DART at Polk County School officials. We 
wonder why he couldn’t have just cracked a few windows?
Hell, if it had been us, we would’ve saved the fart to drop on 
an unsuspecting teacher in the hallway.
When Bangkok fireman Somchai Yoosabai heard news that 
a comic-loving child had unsafely wandered onto a third-floor balcony, he had just the plan. The Department of Darts & Lau-rels awards a can-you-climb-walls-and-shoot-webs? LAUREL 
to the Spider-Man fireman, for channeling his inner Peter Park-er and rocking the red, black and blue tights to coax the young boy off the ledge. Just another day at the office for man who dons an Ultraman costume to spice up fire drills at schools. 
No word on whether Marvel Comics has offered him a con-
tract yet.
Responding to countless questions related to the topic, Presi-
dent Barack Obama took a stance on pot during his virtual town hall meeting sure to disappoint many of his supporters. For failing to see the positive economic implications of legalizing marijuana across the country, the Department of Darts & Lau-rels launches a we-are-talking-about-the-possibility-of-billions-of-dollars-here DART at President Barack Obama. Something 
tells us that “Barry” wouldn’t have minded a few tokes on the ol’ pipe to relaxe his muscles after a rough-and-tumble game of hoops. 
Members of Equality is Gainesville’s Business can thank an 
unlikely source for helping defeat Charter Amendment 1. The Department of Darts & Laurels proudly presents a Gainesville-couldn’t-have-done-it-without-you LAUREL to the students of 
UF for swarming the polls to vote in Tuesday’s city election. To put things in perspective, nearly seven times more voters made their opinion count than in the previous stand-alone election.
And to think, the city didn’t even need cheesy videos from 
Diddy encouraging students to rock the vote.
What began as a heartfelt congratulations to the UF football 
team for winning the BCS championship ended in a viral video sensation sweeping YouTube. For embarrassing The Gator Na-tion in front of the entire House of Representatives on Capitol Hill, the Department of Darts & Laurels tosses a his-name-is-Percy-Harvin-not-Percy-Harvey DART at Rep. Corrine Brown 
from the 3rd District of Florida. Let’s do a quick fact check, it’s Coach Urban Meyer, not Corch Urban Meyers, as Brown so elo-quently states during her speech.
The Department of Darts & Laurels gives back the balance 
of our time. Instead of simply sparing their loose pocket change for panhandlers, one father and son duo turned to the Internet to help those less fortunate than themselves. The Department of Darts & Laurels extends a they-raised-$50,000-in-donations-in-less-than-two-months LAUREL to Kevin and Sean Dolan, 
for providing Timothy Edwards a new lease on life after de-cades of homelessness by paying him to promote their Web site, PimpThisBum.com. For Edwards, just carrying a sign baring the web address netted him $100 a day along with a free trip to rehab thanks to one generous donor visiting the site.
That’s all for this week. “Go Gator!”

Opportunity Scholars deserve their awards
Johnathan Lott’s column on the need to increase 
the quality of education at  UF is well-intentioned but 
terribly misguided. First, Florida Opportunity Schol-ars are held to the same admission standards as other UF students. So to suggest that there is a “lack of any 
notable academic qualifications” is to suggest that not 
only are the scholarship recipients underqualified, but that the rest of UF students are undeserving of admissions as well. Immediately after, he suggested that this program is risky because some of the money will be wasted on students who “can’t handle UF.”
The fact is that 96 percent of Florida Opportunity 
Scholars return after their freshman year, compared to 94 percent for other UF students. Furthermore, 65 
percent of those students had a 3.0 GPA or better. 
While I agree that UF’s reputation and educational quality must be improved, the problem does not re-side with academic merits of the students.
We should focus on developing innovative curric-
ulum that stimulates and engages students. We also need to consider a faculty member’s merit as an edu-cator and mentor equal to his or her ability to publish or bring in grant money. Not recognizing a student’s 
academic achievements in overcoming the obstacles 
of growing up in a working class household is more than just inconsiderate, it’s morally despicable.

It’s 9:17 a.m. He’s still asleep, of 
course. You’re wearing his clothes, but there’s no way you’re going to 
wear them home. And your only other option is a little red dress and leopard 
stilettos. But with a 10:40 a.m. class and 
a desperately needed shower, you swal-low your pride and brave the streets. 
Oh, yes, the all-too-familiar walk of 
shame. If you haven’t been victim to it, then I’m sure you’ve witnessed it. But honestly, it shouldn’t be so shameful. After all, when stuck in this kind of sticky situation, what’s a girl to do? 
Well, have no fear, because the Walk 
of Shame kit is here. Girls, get ready to ditch that embarrassing morning-after march. And guys, ever wonder what happened to your favorite T-shirt? Or how about those black Nike gym shorts? You won’t have to make any calls to last night’s mistake to get your things back because with the Walk of 
Shame kit, clothes won’t be disappear-
ing any longer. 
Clubsmerch, a Miami-based com-
pany, is releasing its newest item fully equipped to send you home after a rough night with your head held high.Girls, I 
know you love stealing clothes from guys; their oversized 
sweatshirts are 
the best. But it’s time to let that go. Plus, 
walking home in his clothes (as op-posed to your outfit from last night) still looks shameful. 
With blisters on your heels and major 
pain throughout your feet from danc-ing all night, you’re definitely going to love the kit’s flip-flops. Or you might 
be disgusted by the guy you wake up 
with — drinking does impair judgment — and need to dash away quickly. We all know you won’t be able to run away fast enough in last night’s heels. 
But what are you supposed to do 
with the clothes from last night? There’s no chance everything will fit in your black clutch. But with a sweet little 
drawstring backpack, you’ll have no 
problem making a quick getaway with all of your belongings. 
And let’s face it: Everyone looks 
rough on the walk of shame. Clumps of mascara are smudged under your bloodshot eyes, and you’re in desper-ate need of concealer to hide dark puffy eye bags because you were up all night long. Well, the kit has hypoallergenic wipes, which are 100 percent safe for 
your face and anywhere below. This 
way you’ll be able to clean up any dirty messes you might have made the night before.
But wait a minute, what about get-
ting that disgusting taste out of your mouth? As long as you have water, you’ll be good to go with the kit’s pre-pasted toothbrush. 
And just in case you had a fabulous 
night and aren’t sure if the guy you’re leaving will remember your name and number, the kit comes with a notecard to leave behind. 
The kit will be available in boutiques 
around the world, even in a customized version for hotel minibars. 
So, it’s time to throw your inhibitions 
into the wind and enjoy your night out without the stress of what to do the morning after. Hold your head up high, girls — walking home has never been more decent.

� THE POOL AT THE O’DOME WILL 
CLOSE UNTIL THIRD WEEK IN JUNE.
By MARY MANCHESS
Alligator Contributing Writer
 
The indoor pool at the O’Connell Center 
closed on Monday due to renovations. 
According to Erva Gilliam, the coordina-
tor for UF swimming, the renovations will be complete the third week of June and will include resurfacing the pool deck and re-placing the current flooring with tile. 
Some starting blocks in the deep end will also be resurfaced, and additional painting 
will be done around the pool’s perimeter.
“Basically, it’s due for a face lift,” Gilliam 
said. “It will help with recruiting efforts and 
help us be a little more competitive with the 
universities that are building and have built 
facilities.”
When asked about the budget, Gilliam 
declined to comment. However, she said the 
University Athletic Association would pro-
vide the funding for the project. 
While the renovations are anticipated to 
enhance the pool’s appearance, they have 
caused inconveniences. 
Gilliam said the UF swim team had to reschedule its two-a-day practices at differ-ent locations. Members of the Club Alliga-
tor Swim Team, who usually practice at the 
pool Monday through Friday, have not been 
able to meet. 
Diane James, the risk management and 
aquatics coordinator for RecSports, said 
some of the indoor pool’s usual activities 
have been either postponed or rescheduled 
until the renovations are complete.  One of the options to relocate the pool’s 
functions is the Florida Pool, which belongs 
to the College of Health and Human Per-
formance. However, the pool’s schedule 
includes some academic classes in the eve-
ning, so there is no room to schedule time 
for recreational swimming. 
The renovations have also cut 90 hours a 
week for student lifeguards. 
“Because we knew this was going to hap-
pen and we knew it would impact us so strongly, we chose to rewrite the schedule 
once spring break was over,” James said.

the bottom line.”Swimmers relocate due to campus pool’s renovationsBy ILEANA MORALES

MIAMI — Florida airport 
employees could chase endan-
gered birds from runways with-out fear they’d be prosecuted for harming the animals under a bill 
moving through the state legis-
lature months after geese forced an emergency landing on New York’s Hudson River.
Airports around the state 
typically fire blanks from shot-guns or non-lethal rounds from timer-controlled cannons to scare off birds and other animals. 
Sometimes lethal force is used on 
common birds such as doves, but an airport employee could face fines or even criminal charges if he were to accidentally hit an en-dangered or threatened species.
A Senate committee voted 
unanimously Wednesday for the bill offering airport employees 
protection from those penalties, 
entitled “The Airline Safety and Wildlife Protection Act of Flori-da.” The House version is mov-ing through a committee, after 
which point it would face a vote 
on the House floor.
“It gives airports the authority they need to protect the consum-
ers,” said the bill’s sponsor, Sen. 
Carey Baker, R-Eustis, who intro-duced the bill last month.
But the problem isn’t unique 
to Florida. In California, Sen. Dave Cox, R-Fair Oaks, worked with airports to propose a similar bill clarifying that federal dep-redation laws trump state laws. 
The bill is being reviewed in a 
committee. If signed into law, Florida and California would be the first states to offer airports such protections, according to the 
National Confer-ence of State Leg-islatures.
A bird strike 
delaying his wife’s flight and the US Airways incident brought bird strikes to the attention of Rep. Scott Plakon, R-Florida, the House bill’s sponsor. Plakon said it exposes something airports pre-ferred not to advertise. In 2008, more than 7,000 wildlife strikes were reported nationally.
Eustis introduced his bill 
weeks after a flock of geese dis-abled both engines of a US Air-ways jetliner, forcing the pilot to land in New York’s Hudson River in January.Bill allows airports

About 300 Air Force, Marine 
Corps, Army and Navy ROTC ca-
dets marched past their reviewing officer in UF’s ROTC Joint Service 
Pass-in-Review Thursday.
UF administrators, friends and 
family watched from under a white 
canopy as cadets marched to the beat of a three-membered band. 
It’s the only thing done at UF 
that incorporates all the branches of ROTC, said Phillip Fischer, event spokesman. 
UF is one of only 38 schools in 
the U.S. that has all four branches of the military. About 100 people attended the ceremony.
Additionally, retired Cpl. 
Duane E. Dewey was recognized 
as one of 97 living recipients of the 
Medal of Honor and only one of nine in Florida. 
After the ceremony, many of the 
cadets hurried to salute and shake hands with Dewey and other high-ranking officers.
Some cadets stopped to take 
pictures with their family and 
friends who came out to watch the 
review.
UF employee Cin-
dy Bryant came to support her husband, 
Brad Bryant, a cadet 
commander in Air Force ROTC.
“It’s kind of sad because my 
husband is graduating,” she said.
“This is kind of the last big 
thing before his commissioning.” 
Dewey, who lives in Alachua County, said he was proud of the 
cadets.
“It’s great to be here and watch 
all the troops,” he said. “They did 
a great job out there.”ROTC cadets march

Elizabeth Jones used to ask questions 
about relationships and family.
Now, Jones, a 33-year-old Gainesville 
resident, has been asking a psychic about 
her economic future.
“I don’t know how I’m going to be able 
to afford to do everything I need to do,” she 
said. “I don’t know how I’m going to be able 
to buy Christmas for my daughter.”
Jones talks to Pernel, a seer at Krystalnet 
Psychic Consultants, Inc., two to three times 
a week. She asks if she’s going to be able to 
afford food and medication for her daughter 
and if she’ll be able to get the jobs she ap-
plies for.
She might not be the only one asking. 
There’s anecdotal evidence that psychics 
have become more popular during these 
economic times, according to an article in 
USA Today.Two local psychics have noticed an in-
crease in the number of people wanting to 
meet with them.
Jesse Lucas, a seer at Wild Iris Books, said 
his business has increased about 400 percent 
over the past two years, particularly in the 
past year and a half.
“The economy’s been very good for my 
business, surprisingly enough,” Lucas said.
Lucas said he has noticed a shift in the 
content of questions. He said the questions 
are becoming less about people’s personal 
lives and more about their fiscal lives.
“It’s probably the one thing that’s on ev-
erybody’s mind,” he said. “It’s been really hard on a lot of my clients.”
Some are now destitute because the econ-
omy caused them to lose almost everything, he said.  One of his clients, whom he con-
siders a professional in the working world, 
became unemployed and homeless because 
of the economy.
“She called me seven times yesterday [Wednesday] because she needed answers,” 
he said. “She needed a way out.”
He said college students seem more wor-
ried about the economy as well. They ask him about how they can live on their bud-
gets and if they’ll be able to pay their bills.
“That surprises me,” he said. “Students 
have always been preoccupied with rela-
tionships.”
Theresa, of Psychic Readings by Theresa, 
didn’t notice an increased concern in stu-
dents about the economy, but about 20 per-
cent to 30 percent more people have gone for readings in the past five or six months. Students ask her about the choices they 
should make about majors and career paths. They want to know if they’ll be successful and stay in their current fields.
Although Pernel said she has not seen 
a dramatic increase in customers, she has seen a change in the questions customers 
ask. Pernel said the most common questions 
she’s asked are about love lives, but those about the economy are quickly catching up. 
She has also noticed more questions relating to stress.
“I think that has a lot to do with the econ-
omy,” she said. “It’s putting a high stress 
level on families.”
Jones said Pernel has given her a lot of 
good advice about issues relating to money, 
her ex-husband and her daughter. But Per-
nel has assisted in more ways than one.
“By the time I’m done talking to her, 
she’s really calmed me down and helped me 
a lot,” Jones said.  “She gives me a real sense 
of peace.”AROUND GAINESVILLEWorries about economy spark business for psychicsStudentLife

The Plaza of the Americas turned 
into a mock refugee camp Thursday 
when about 60 students gathered at an event to learn about global pov-erty and disease.
The ONE campaign’s event to 
promote awareness of problems in Africa, kicked off with a screening 
of “Sons of Lwala,” a documentary 
about two Kenyan brothers who 
built a clinic in their hometown, 
Lwala, to fulfill their father’s dream of having a medical facility there.
Ten students watched the docu-
mentary and stayed to hear a speech 
by Peter Ter, a former Sudanese ref-
ugee who was forced from his home due to civil war during the ‘80s.
He spoke about the fear and hun-
ger he dealt with while in the refu-
gee camps and the tragedy he saw 
when moving from place to place fleeing from the bombs.
Ter, who got his GED in Jackson-
ville and studies political science at 
UF, plans to join the Peace Corps. 
He said he isn’t bitter about his ex-
periences.
“There is no need to be vindic-
tive,” he said. “The best way is to forgive people.”
After Ter’s speech, the event con-
tinued in the Plaza of the Americas, 
where UF’s branch of the ONE cam-paign offered tables from different UF organizations with information 
on gender equality, child health, 
extreme poverty and hunger, envi-
ronmental sustainability, maternal health, global partnership and HIV education.
About 5 people were given free 
HIV blood tests. 
Beaded necklaces and bracelets 
made by Ugandan women were 
sold. All profits from the jewelry 
will go back to the women.
Bryant Shannon, UF’s ONE cam-
paign president, who is ONE’s list of top national student leaders, said 
the group held the event to raise 
awareness in students who might 
not know the details of Africa’s 
problems.“We live in an area where the 
worst thing that happens to us might 
be a bad test grade,” he said. “We 
want to spark attention and bring these issues to the limelight.”
UF management sophomore 
Jack Lee said he was interested to see educational outreach on a cam-pus level.
“It’s good to see that UF is actu-
ally doing something about it,” he said.FRIDAY, MARCH 27, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 11

WASHINGTON — Senate Democrats 
pushed a recession-era budget backed by 
the Obama administration through com-
mittee on Thursday after rejecting Repub-lican attempts to cut spending and reduce mammoth deficits.
The 13-10 vote was along party lines in 
the Senate Budget Committee, and came as GOP critics sharpened their attacks on a plan that Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama derided as “the most irresponsible budget 
in the history of the Republic.”
The plan calls for spending of $3.5 tril-
lion for the year that begins Oct. 1, and as-
sumes a deficit of $1.2 trillion. It includes 
increases for hundreds of domestic pro-grams and clears the way for major legis-
lation later in the year on President Barack 
Obama’s priorities of health care, energy 
and education.
Despite their criticism, Senate Republi-
cans have said they do not intend to pro-
pose an alternative to the Democrats’ bud-
get, a decision that spares them the need to make politically difficult choices.
Republicans conceded that Sen. Kent 
Conrad, D-N.D., chairman of the com-
mittee, had produced a plan that sliced 
recommended spending beneath levels Obama requested less than a month ago, with lower deficits projected as a result.
But some said he had not gone far 
enough, while others argued that the budget lacked the type of enforcement measures needed to make sure the targets aren’t exceeded in future years.
Sessions’ attempt to cut an additional $200 billion from non-defense domestic programs over five years was defeated on 
a party-line vote, 13-10.
Conrad responded that he already had 
trimmed spending below Obama’s request 
by $160 billion over five years and had re-
duced the deficit by two-thirds over the 
same period. He said Sessions’ proposal would have frozen spending in particu-
larly worthy programs like veterans services “at a time 
when we have large num-
bers of them returning from 
Iraq and Afghanistan.”
Republicans also failed several times to 
make it more difficult for Congress to ex-ceed spending limits prescribed for 2011-2014.
Budget debates are often highly parti-
san in Congress, and the debate occurred 
one day after Democrats across the Capitol pushed a slightly different budget through 
the House Budget Committee on a party-
line vote.
House Republicans have pledged to 
present an alternative by next week, and 
issued an 18-page booklet Thursday that 
they said would pave the way for econom-
ic recovery.
It included few specific proposals, al-
though it called for cuts in domestic pro-grams and new tax reductions for individ-
uals, investors and some businesses.
Both houses will vote next week on the 
budgets, and the eventual compromise will 
be prelude to months of struggle in which 
the Democratic-controlled Congress tries 
to implement Obama’s agenda.
While both the House and Senate bud-
get plans leave room for those bills, they defer difficult decisions until later in the 
year.Democratic budget closely passes Senate committee“We live in an area where

The UF organization Victory Over Violence will present 
“The Vagina Monologues” on Sunday, March 29 to promote 
awareness about domestic abuse and raise money for Peaceful Paths, a non-profit domestic abuse center in Gainesville.
The play, based off of Eve Ensler’s book, covers a broad 
range of women’s topics in a funny, sad, and moving way, said Jackie Azis, president of Victory Over Violence and director of the play.
“It talks about everything from hair to tampons, to exams, 
and then it gets to serious stuff such as rape and incest and mu-tilation,” she said. “It’s personal in that a lot of the stories wom-en can relate to — people don’t expect it to be so moving.”
So far, about 96 tickets have been sold for the first showing, 
at 12:30 pm, and 133 for the second showing, at 3:30 pm.
Ninety percent of the play’s proceeds go to Peaceful Paths 
and the other 10 percent go to V-Day, a global movement to stop violence against women and girls.
According to Azis, this is the largest pre-sale they have had 
in a few years. She believes the community is coming out to show their support for Peaceful Paths, whose outreach office was burned down on Feb. 25.Play held to stop

AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY.

This weekend the O’Connell Center won’t 
be filled with Gator fans cheering for a sports 
team. Instead, it will house UF’s fifth annual Relay for Life.  Relay for Life, a national fundraising event, 
which donates proceeds to the American Can-cer Society to fund cancer research, will begin Friday at 6 p.m. and last until noon  Saturday.  
This 18-hour event honors people who 
have survived cancer and those who lost their fight with the disease, said David Rountree, UF’s Relay for Life event chairman.
About 80 teams, made up of 10 to 15 people, 
were sponsored to walk the track in memory of those who fought cancer, Rountree said.
Rountree said UF raised about $105,000 last year, and expects to raise a similar amount this year, despite the economic downturn.
He said about $90,000 has already been 
raised, and fundraising efforts will continue 
during the event.
“Going into the school year I was worried 
the economy would affect our goal,” he said, 
adding he was happy to see people still gave generously. 
“People really dug into their pockets, and 
it’s really exceeded my expectations,” he said.
At this year’s Relay, local bands, dance troupes and two comedians will be perform-ing, as well as the UF competitive cheerlead-ing squad and the Santa Fe College cheerlead-ing squad.
The Luminaria ceremony will be held on 
Friday at 9 p.m. During this ceremony, can-dles are lit and placed inside bags bearing the names of those who have fought cancer. The bags are then placed along the track.
“[The ceremony is] to honor those who 
have fallen from cancer,” Rountree said. O’Dome will host UF’s fifth annual Relay for Life
go up, but that he thought it was only going to really affect sales for two to three months.
“People tend to calm down and 
buy less,” he said. 
Uddin said he has started to see 
a trend in which consumers are switching from mainstream brands to off-brands.
Some products, like roll-your-own tobacco, have seen over a 2,000 percent price increase, he said. Roll-your-own tobacco used to be a low-er-cost alternative to cigarettes, Hi-
ley said, but now it’s going to be just 
as expensive. The tax will rise from $1.10 per pound to $24.78 per pound of tobacco. Additionally, cigarette papers and cigarette tubes taxes will increase, but by a lesser amount.
Uddin said he buys his cigarettes 
wholesale from Sam’s Club, and they’ve been charging the tax for two weeks.
While Hiley said he understands 
the purpose of the tax, he isn’t happy 
that it was placed in the laps of smokers.
The increase was 
included in the Chil-
dren’s Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009 to help provide an additional $31.5 billion over the next 4 1/2 years for health care for uninsured children  from low-income families, according to the bureau’s Web site. 
Hiley said he recently has had 
trouble finding some brands of to-bacco, because other retailers have stockpiled up. This is a bad strategy, he said, because retailers have to pay a floor stocks tax on all merchandise they have for sale on April 1 — even if the merchandise was bought be-fore the tax increase.“They won’t make a profit that 
way,” he said. “It all evens out.”
The price of some packs of small 
cigarettes at Modern Age have al-
ready gone up $1, before the April 
1 effective date, Hiley said, because some wholesale retailers have grad-ually raised their prices in the last few weeks to adjust to the new tax rates. 
“This is the largest tax increase 
I’ve seen,” he said.
Uddin: Consumers are switching from mainstream cigarettes to off- brands
The college focused on cutting the dean’s 
office first, with almost half of the 10 percent reduction coming from that office, she wrote.

posal would involve eight layoffs, according to 
information provided by dean John Wright.
Seven of those are faculty members, he said, 
and one is a staff member. The plan would also 
leave two positions unfilled and eliminate one employee in the Deferred Retirement Option Program (DROP).
The proposal would also get rid of the col-lege’s Documentary Institute and the master’s degree program in Documentary Film.
Four of the layoffs, all faculty members, 
would be in the Documentary Institute. Wright said the institute, although award-winning, is 
not as central to the college’s mission.
The College of Dentistry’s proposal in-
cludes plans for a cut of almost $1.7 million, 
though college spokeswoman Karen Rhoden-izer said the college expects to make up some of those potential losses with other revenues from its clinical practice as well as donations and grants.
The proposal states that clinical revenues 
increased about $1.2 million, or 16 percent, from last year.
The proposal does not include any layoffs 
but Rhodenizer said some positions will be left unfilled, though how many is unclear.
It also includes 
plans to reduce the number of speakers for the dean’s semi-
nars and spending on food for research-relat-ed meetings.
The college’s departments were also asked 
to make across-the-board cuts of 2 to 3 percent. The college does not plan to reduce enroll-ment, Rhodenizer said.
All colleges and administrative units were asked to submit 10 percent budget cut propos-als in anticipation of a possible reduction in the university-wide budget of $72 million to $75 million.
Proposals are due to UF Provost Joe Glover 
by April 1 and will be publicly released April 15, which will open a period of public com-ment until the final plan must be submitted to the Board of Trustees, which will take the final vote sometime in May.
The 10 percent proposals have been called 
a “worst-case scenario.” When UF submits its final budget, it plans to enact vertical cuts, cut-ting some colleges more than others, instead of 
even across-the board cuts.
The College of Journalism’s proposal will eliminate the Documentary InstituteTAX , from page 1

Westgate Plazanuses paid to AIG executives after the com-
pany’s federal bailout.
The largest single award to a UF fac-
ulty member was an incentive payment of $99,000. Most payments were below $5,000, 
though some received multiple payments.
Money for the awards came from the Fac-
ulty Practice Plan, said Michael Good, dean 
of the college. The plan is funded by revenues from faculty members practicing medicine, Good said.
“This is faculty working in the clinic, 
working in the hospital, taking care of pa-tients,” he said. “No state funds were used to 
pay these bonuses.”
“This isn’t AIG,” he said.
While some faculty who got awards do 
not treat patients, most who received the awards contributed to the practice plan, UF spokesman Steve Orlando said. 
Good argued the awards are necessary to 
keep top faculty at UF.
“In the highly competitive world of aca-
demic medicine, we have to compete for doc-tors that could be practicing at Harvard, at Duke, at San Francisco,” he said.
Faculty are evaluated based on patient 
satisfaction and professionalism, as well as the number of patients they see and proce-dures they perform, and are compensated accordingly, he said.
But some critics, such as John Biro, presi-
dent of the United Faculty of Florida, UF’s faculty union, argue the money could be 
better spent by preventing layoffs instead of 
adding to the salaries of some faculty.
“How come we have all that money and 
then we have to fire tenure-track faculty in CLAS (the College of Liberal Arts and Scienc-es) and the school of education?” he asked, adding UF continues to hire new administra-tors, faculty and staff.
“I don’t see how an administration can 
be allowed to get away with this,” Biro said. “That’s not what you do in a university, that’s what you do at Enron maybe.”
Orlando said it’s possible the money used 
for bonuses and incentives could be put to-ward other things, like preventing layoffs, for example, but he said that would hurt the health of the practice plan.
“If you are one of the people performing 
the service and providing medical care for the community… and then suddenly (the money is) being used for purposes other than the College of Medicine…it becomes a disin-centive,” he said.
The argument that UF should use funds 
from other colleges and even affiliated orga-
nizations, such as Shands at UF or the University Athletic Association, is not 
a new one.
Members of UF’s facul-
ty union asked UF to do it 
last year, and the idea was thrust into the spotlight earlier this month when 
members of the faculty 
and graduate assistant unions proposed it at the Board of Trustees meeting.
Though some university officials have 
said UF cannot take money from affiliated organizations, such as Shands at UF, which held about $600 million in unrestricted assets in 2008, to balance its budget, the process is technically possible, said Matt Fajack, UF’s chief financial officer.
However, he said it would be difficult. The 
board of directors for the organization would 
have to sign off on the transfer and, if that didn’t happen, UF could conceivably replace 
board members when they step down over time with new ones favorable to the idea.
Another idea proposed by the unions is 
using the university’s own unrestricted as-sets, which totaled about $80 million in 2008, to prevent layoffs.   UF officials have stated the university cannot use some of that money be-cause they are required by state law to keep a 
certain amount in reserves. As it stands, how-
ever, UF is only required to notify the Board of Governors, which oversees the state’s 11 public universities, when reserves dip below a certain amount.
But Fajack said even if the state doesn’t 
require it, he still thinks it’s good fiscal policy to have healthy reserves in case of emergen-cies– if the state withdrew funding mid-year, 
for example.
“The state could hold ($80 million) back in 
a minute,” he said.
And, even in the best case scenario, he said 
using the money to prevent layoffs probably 
wouldn’t help faculty much in lean budget times like this.
“We don’t lay them off this year, but we 
lay them off next year, and then our reserves 
are completely gone,” he said.
Bonuses came from practicing faculty; no state funds were used

FRIDAY, MARCH 27, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 21
By KYLE MAISTRI
Alligator Staff Writer
kmaistri@alligator.org
Junior center fielder Matt den 
Dekker had been a do-it-all player 
in his first two seasons at UF, but coach Kevin O’Sullivan has man-
aged to find new ways for the pre-
season All-American to make an 
impact on the team. 
O’Sullivan moved den Dekker 
into the leadoff spot in the batting 
order on March 18 against Central 
Florida, and the junior will remain 
the table setter tonight in UF’s (15-8, 3-3 Southeastern Conference) 6:30 matchup with Alabama (16-7, 
3-3 SEC). 
“Moving him to the leadoff spot 
has consciously changed his ap-proach to using the whole field,” 
O’Sullivan said. 
Den Dekker has had a hit in 
each of his games since moving to 
the top of the lineup and is hitting .400 while setting the pace for the Gators’ offense.
Although leadoff hitters are 
usually only thought of as speedy singles hitters, den Dekker, who leads the team with five stolen bas-es and has yet to get caught steal-ing, still provides power. 
The outfielder leads the team 
with four home runs, and his .536 slugging percentage is second to senior Avery Barnes, who, ironi-cally, started the season as the team’s leadoff hitter.
Twice in the last week, den 
Dekker has taken an opposing left-handed pitcher deep over the 
right-field wall in close games.
“He’s been more aggressive, not 
taking pitches in hitter’s counts,” 
junior catcher 
Buddy Munroe 
said. 
UF will need 
all the offen-sive production den Dekker can muster with the Crimson Tide coming to town 
for a weekend series.
Alabama is averaging just fewer 
than 10 runs per game and show-cases one of the best hitters in the nation. Senior outfielder Kent Mat-thes comes into tonight’s game hit-ting .424 with a .500 on-base per-centage, but his power numbers 
are startling. 
The senior is slugging 1.059 
with 41 RBIs and 15 home runs, 
matching the total for UF’s entire team.
Matthes is far from the only 
offensive talent on the Crimson Tide’s roster, and O’Sullivan isn’t counting on any weak spots in its lineup. 
“Probably their best attribute is 
they got an older club,” O’Sullivan said. “They’ve got veterans all over the field and on the pitching side of things.
“They’re very well-balanced, 
they’re very well-coached, and they have a confident swagger about them.”
Junior Jeff Barfield (2-0, 1.17 ERA) will get the start for the 
Gators tonight and attempt to set 
the tone for the rest of the series.
Barfield was thought to be the 
leading candidate for the closer’s role before the season started, but has emerged as UF’s most depend-able starter.
“I expected him to be good, but 
I don’t know if you ever expect people to be as good as they are or as bad as they are,” O’Sullivan said. “But the one thing he is, he’s a competitor.”
Munroe said the right-hander 
had a rough fall on the mound, but his hard-breaking slider has helped him turn it around.
“He wasn’t exactly lights out,” 
Munroe. “He’s turned it on and been really good for us.”

FOR THE FOOTBALL TEAM.
By TONI-ANN MILLER
Alligator Writer 
This weekend, when the UF men’s track 
and field team competes for the first time since its second-place finish in the NCAA Indoor Championships on March 14, there will be a new yet familiar face looking to contribute on the track for UF: Jeff Demps.
The Gators traveled to Tallahassee to 
start the Florida State Relays on Thursday with Demps as the newest addition to an al-ready excellent squad.
Demps, who plays running back on the football team, began practicing with the 
track team on March 17 and has impressed 
coach Mike Holloway with his work ethic. 
“He’s been fine, he’s been awesome, he’s 
Jeff Demps,” Holloway said. “He shows up every day, he’s a great guy (and) does every-thing you ask him to do.
“The big thing with Jeff is I have to be 
careful not to let him do too much because he’ll just go all day if I let him.”
Demps will make his much-anticipated 
debut Saturday, competing in the 4x100-me-ter relay and possibly the 100-meter dash, Holloway said.
When Demps takes the track, all eyes will 
be on him to see if he lives up to the pre-season expectations placed on him after he ran a 10.01-second 100-meter dash during the 2008 U.S. Olympic Trials.
Demps didn’t make the Olympic team, 
but he received loads of media attention for his effort.
Prior to this season, Demps 
was named one of the Top 12 U.S. Sprinters/Hurdlers to Watch in 2009 by TrackShark, largely due to his 100-meter performance. Joining Demps on the list were accomplished 
Olympic sprinters Walter Dix, Tyson Gay, Sanya Richards and Allyson Felix.
Holloway said the addition of Demps 
will certainly make the Gators better, but it will not affect the team’s weekly preparation for meets. 
“The process doesn’t change here. Our goal is to be better weekly. We have to keep 
everybody focused on the Gators,” Hollo-
way said. “Jeff’s gonna help this team, he’s gonna run well, and he’s gonna help our re-lay run well.”
As Demps laces up his track cleats, he 
will not only look to live up to the hype sur-rounding him, he also will look to help UF’s men kick off their outdoor season and reach the standard Holloway has set for them.
“We’ve been training pretty hard for the 
last couple weeks,” Holloway said. “Our goal is simply to go up there and get the rust of indoor off. 
“We’re not expecting to go up there and 
set the world on fire, but we’re expecting everybody to go up there and be very com-petitive.”
Demps to make track debut at Florida State Relays
“I’m looking forward to winning, 
but that’s going to be a hard chal-
lenge. They’re a great team,” Walton 
said. 
“I don’t think you’re going to 
find any 1-0 ballgames out here next 
week. It has the potential to be a slug-
fest, and we’re going to have to do a 
good job of coming out and swinging the bat as well.”
A higher-scoring game will cer-
tainly work in the Gators’ favor. The 
team won the season series 2-1 last 
year, with UF’s victories coming by scores of 8-4 and 4-1, the latter bring-ing home the Gators’ first SEC Cham-
pionship.
If the Gators want to continue 
their dominance over the top teams 
in the SEC, they will need to put up the kind of scores they did against Georgia (15-0 and 4-0 wins on March 
11) and Tennessee (7-0, 7-0 and 4-1 
victories last weekend). 
After posting shutouts in the 
previous eight conference games, 
Gardiner said UF’s comeback win 
against Tennessee on Sunday pro-vided a challenge similar to the one they will face this weekend.“It makes us more prepared for 
games like that in the postseason, too,” the senior first baseman said. “That’s what the postseason’s all about.
“People are going to bring their A 
game for possibly that last game of the season for them. That really helps us for Alabama and down the road.”
Despite starting out slow against 
Tennessee pitcher Cat Hosfield on Sunday, UF’s hitters were able to make adjustments at the plate during their 
second and third at-
bats. He hopes his play-
ers are able to mirror that success against Alabama’s ace, Kelsi Dunne 
(12-0, 0.56 ERA), and backups Char-
lotte Morgan (8-4, 1.95) — who also leads the team in RBIs — and Aman-da Locke (6-0, 1.91).
“I don’t think we do much dif-
ferent (than we did last weekend),” Walton said. 
“I think we just do the same 
things we do, just try to break down 
their pitchers if we can and try to put 
ourselves in a position where we can handle all three of their pitchers as opposed to getting caught up in just one.”SOFT , from page 22

For what most considered to be a meaningless game dur-
ing the middle of the NCAA Tournament, the scene in the UF 
locker room looked like it was anything but.
Reporters crowded around players with hung heads as they 
tried to put their disappointment into words.
After being ranked No. 19 at the start of the season, the 
Gators’ tumultuous season came to an end Tuesday night with a 71-62 loss to Penn State in the quarterfinals of the National Invitation Tournament.
UF (25-11) finished its second straight sea-
son without making it to the NCAA Tourna-ment and failed to make a return to Madison Square Garden and the NIT semifinals like it did a year ago.
It was a far cry from the turnaround year 
the team predicted in October.
A little more than a year ago, Dan Werner 
sat in a dimly lit locker room in The World’s Most Famous Are-na and watched as teammates and coaches shook their heads and promised next year would be different.
The scene this year was almost identical.“I’m just as confused as anybody,” he said. “Coach built this 
as one of the top programs in the country, and unfortunately 
these last two years we took it down a couple of steps.”
The game might as well have been a mirror image of the 
Gators’ season. Their goal was well within reach. A win against 
the banged-up and offensively challenged Nittany Lions would have punched their ticket to New York.
It wasn’t the ideal end to the season —  UF became the 
first team since Michigan State in 1981 to not make the NCAA Tournament in consecutive years after winning the national

� NO. 1 UF WILL FACE NO. 4 
ALABAMA FOR A 3-GAME SET.

It’s no secret that the Gators softball 
team has been looking forward to this 
weekend since the season started.
In the team’s media guide, senior 
first baseman Ali Gardiner said UF’s series against Alabama was her most anticipated matchup of the year.
No. 1 UF (32-2, 11-0 Southeastern 
Conference) will take on No. 4 Alabama (26-4, 6-2 SEC) this weekend in a three-game home series, starting Saturday at 1 p.m.
Last week, Alabama was ranked       No. 2 in the country, and had the team 
not lost twice to No. 17 LSU last week-
end, this weekend would have pitted the top two teams in the nation against each other for the first time ever.
But when it comes to facing the 
Tide, the rankings don’t matter to the Gators.
“Alabama’s always been a tough 
competitor, and I think we’re all really 
excited,” Gardiner said. 
“We’ve been looking forward to it 
for a long time, but now it’s here and 
we’re ready to go.”
UF coach Tim Walton also expressed 
his excitement for this weekend’s con-ference showdown, adding how impor-tant it will be for the Gators to come out with energy early in the game.Gators roll into Tide series

Preseason predictions usually result in 
meaningless blather.
In this case, however, the Gators’ pre-
season motto rang true.
UF (24-8) was indeed “Bigger and Bet-
ter” a year after it reached the Women’s 
National Invitation Tournament, just as its coach and media guide had promised.
“It says a lot about this team when you 
can talk about things like that in Septem-ber, in October, and then back it up,” UF coach Amanda Butler said. “That was a great way for us to start the season — by projecting big things — and that’s the only 
way that you achieve great things is to set 
those expectations high at the beginning.”
The Gators’ appearance in the NCAA 
Tournament in Butler’s second year would likely have been refreshing enough for this team.
Getting a first-round win and advanc-
ing to the second round was more than sat-isfying, considering how far UF has come so quickly.
Now the standard has been set.“I told our seniors and our whole group 
collectively after we lost the other night that as disappointed as we felt right now, the big picture was that this collection of 
women that we have in the room right here 
— that we will never have together again like this —  set the standard for the future of this program,” Butler said. “There’s no question we’ll be disappointed every year if there’s 
anything less than postseason play in the 
NCAA Tournament.”
This was a record-breaking season for 
UF, highlighted by exceeding outside ex-
pectations.
But if you ask the players and coaches, 
they’ll tell you they believed there was no limit on how far they could go.UF WOMEN’S BASKETBALLBar set high after ’08-’09SEE HOOPS, PAGE 23

title — but  it would have salvaged a little bit 
of pride.
Instead, UF crumbled under the weight of 
expectations and played one of its sloppiest games of the season.
“I went to college wanting to make the 
NCAA Tournament every year,” Werner said. “Obviously, we have a lot of work to do. This is two years in a row we’re in the NIT, and this isn’t where Coach built the program to be.”
 War of Attrition 
 The Gators probably should have known 
they were in trouble when seldom-used walk-on Kyle McClanahan entered the game early in the ﬁ  rst half.
But it’s not like UF coach Billy Donovan 
had much of a choice. Injuries had UF practi-cally limping into the postseason. UF started the year with 12 scholarship players and what looked like a team deep enough to make it through Southeastern Conference play.
The early-season transfer of sophomore 
point guard and former McDonald’s All-American Jai Lucas to Texas was a big blow. 
Without Lucas, 5-foot-8 guard Erving 
Walker was forced to play major minutes.
And although the freshman played well 
this season, the Gators were sorely lacking the leadership and late-game shooting Lucas could have given them. 
Adam Allen, Eloy Vargas and Allan 
Chaney all missed signiﬁ  cant time with inju-ries this year, crippling an already depleted lineup, and it didn’t help that center Kenny Kadji was ruled out during the NIT with a concussion. By the time Penn State came to town, Donovan was working with an eight-man rotation. 
The Gators took their biggest hit inside, 
where Werner and sophomore center Alex Tyus — a more natural power forward — were forced to play out of position all year.
“You’ve got to play with what you’ve got,” 
Werner said. “You can’t complain because guys are undersized or playing out of position. We are what we are. We just tried to make the best out of it.” 
 Calathes Can’t Do It All 
 The largest swarm of reporters in the post-
game locker room was huddled around All-SEC point guard Nick Calathes as he dodged questions about a potential jump to the NBA.
“I’m not really thinking about that right 
now,” Calathes said. “But when it’s time, I’ll sit down with Coach and my family and de-cide from there.”
Calathes set a single-season school record 
with 231 assists and scored 618 points this year, the ﬁ  fth-highest single-season total in school history. 
A month ago, Calathes looked like a lock 
for the ﬁ  rst round of the NBA Draft. But after 
struggling late in the season and failing to get 
UF back to the NCAA Tournament, his draft stock has taken a substantial hit.
Several draft Web sites have pushed Cal-
athes out of the guaranteed money of the ﬁ  rst round and into the second.
“I have no idea (about) any of those things,” 
Donovan said. “I’m supportive of Nick. Cer-tainly we would love to have him back here, and I would love to coach him again.” 
 Couldn’t Finish 
 With 2:10 left in the game, UF cut a 10-point 
Penn State lead to 61-59.
But as they have done all year, the Gators 
managed to pull defeat from the jaws of vic-tory. The Nittany Lions scored two baskets 
and went 6 for 6 from the free-throw line in 
game’s ﬁ  nal minute.
It was a characteristic collapse for a team 
that had ﬁ  ve losses by 3 points or fewer this season, including Zam Fredrick’s heartbreak-ing buzzer beater after a total defensive break-down at South Carolina and a 2-point embar-rassment against SEC cellar dweller Georgia.
In a lot of ways, UF ﬁ  nished its season the 
same way it ﬁ  nished games.
They started strong, jumping out to an 18-2 
record on the back of one of the nation’s weak-est non-conference schedules, and then pro-ceeded to lose seven of their last 12 games on their way to missing the NCAA Tournament.
“I was sad,” Hodge said. “I knew we were 
not going to make it after that loss (to Auburn in the SEC Tournament).”
UF was 2-7 on the road this year and 2-6 
away from home in conference games. 
The Gators searched for a go-to guy 
in crunch time all season, but no one ever emerged. Calathes showed that he might have been the guy after his game-winning shot against North Carolina State on Jan. 3.
But the sophomore deferred to teammates 
in similar situations during conference play, 
sometimes even passing up open shots. Walk-
er struggled to make shots and was blocked several times in late-game situations.  What Now? 
 Amid a sea of frustration, the name buzz-
ing around the locker room was that of a guy who didn’t even play.
In fact, he hadn’t all season.Vernon Macklin, the 6-foot-10 Georgetown 
transfer, had suddenly become a beacon of hope for the UF basketball program.
“I think it’s very, very unfair for Vernon 
going into next year that people think that he’s a dominant (player),” Donovan said. “He’s not. He’s a good player. He’s got a long, long way to go.”
Macklin averaged 3.4 points and 2.1 re-
bounds per game in 2007-08 at Georgetown.
The Gators should also get a boost from 
6-foot-2 super recruit Kenny Boynton.
Boynton averaged 34.5 points per game as 
a junior at Plantation American Heritage High and chose UF over Duke and Texas.
“What kind of impact do they make? I 
don’t know,” Donovan said. “I think they’re going to be good players. There’s certainly some pieces we need to add, a different ele-
ment we need to add, there’s no question.”
With the addition of Boynton, fellow recruit 
6-foot-10 forward Erik Murphy and 6-foot-9 
forward DeShawn Painter, UF would be over the NCAA maximum of 13 scholarships.
The Gators found themselves in a similar 
situation last season before Marreese Speights entered the NBA draft and Jonathan Mitchell opted to transfer to Rutgers. 
If Calathes elects to return to Gainesville 
for his junior season, a transfer from one of the team’s current members would be inevitable. 
Vargas, Allen and Chaney are likely tar-
gets. Georgetown transfer Macklin, incoming Boynton could spark team
The Gators were even a little bit 
disappointed when they found out they were only given a No. 8 seed in the tournament.
“It may seem silly to talk about 
it now that we think we were good enough to be playing in that nation-al championship game, but we fully believed it,” Butler said. “That’s the ﬁ  rst step to making something spe-cial happen. You’ve got to believe it with your whole heart.”
The Gators dropped their sea-
son opener at Florida Gulf Coast, 
and that may have been the turning point in their season.
UF responded with a school-
record 15 straight wins, including 
victories over three ranked non-con-ference teams.
They didn’t slow down once 
Southeastern Conference play be-gan. UF, picked to ﬁ  nish sixth in the 
conference before the season, started 
8-1 in league play and capped off its school-record, seven-game SEC winning streak with a home vic-tory over powerhouse Tennessee in front of the second-largest crowd in school history.
The marquee victory marked just 
the third time ever the Gators had knocked off the Volunteers, and it propelled UF to a fourth-place ﬁ  nish in the SEC.
While UF struggled down the 
stretch, losing ﬁ  ve of its last six games in the regular season and 
SEC Tournament to some of its 
stiffest competi-
tion, the Gators still managed to tie the 1994-95 UF team for the most wins in a season.
Two players on this squad, Sha 
Brooks and Marshae Dotson, left a permanent mark on the program in their senior years. Both were named unanimous First Team All-SEC se-lections by SEC coaches.
For a duo that experienced a 
nine-win season not too long ago, this year was like ﬁ  nishing on top.
“We did a lot this year,” Dotson 
said. “Coming from my sophomore 
year, we were 9-22 to 24-8. I think 
that’s a helluva difference. It’s a lot better than where we started.”
Brooks added: “It means that our 
team improved so much. We grew up together. We went through the rough days together. The not-so-good season from being 9-22, and then, of course, Amanda Butler came in, and it’s like everybody just believed in what she was teaching and everybody worked hard for her, and that’s how we got to where we are now.”
Butler appreciated what those 
two seniors did in their time in Gainesville.
“They left a tremendous legacy 
here and had senior seasons in par-ticular that they really deserved,” Butler said. “They set a very high standard of expectation. It’s going to be impossible to replace those guys.”
Even so, Butler’s expectations 
will be even higher next season.
