ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) — A 49-year-old Jackson man has 
been arrested in Ann Arbor following a fight with the pet par -
rot carried in his backpack. Police told Annarbor.com for a story 
Wednesday that witnesses reported the colorful bird was shaken so violently that its feathers were scattered.
Lt. Renee Bush said the parrot was “squawking loudly.”But the bird was fighting back, leaving one of its owner’s 
thumbs “scratched and bloodied.” The parrot suffered a red eye and bald patches. Bush said it also was limping.
The owner said he was disciplining and training the bird. He 
was held in the Washtenaw County Jail pending charges.

Global Gators
UF freshman John Rohde speaks to representatives about a study abroad trip to Chengdu, China Wednes-
day afternoon on the Reitz Union Colonnade. The table was part of the 2010 Study Abroad Fair. Students 
who took the first step to becoming a “Global Gator” were able to speak with staff and students who have been abroad, as well as with representatives from approved study abroad programs to learn more about studying overseas.
LEGAL ISSUES
By ALEXANDER KLAUSNER
Alligator Writer
Four high schools in Florida, Mississippi 
and Arkansas have been asked to end their 
use of UF’s alligator-head logo on their uni-forms and merchandise.
The university’s licensing company, 
Collegiate Licensing Company, has sent out cease-and-desist letters since January to schools that have been using the logo.
Schools using the Florida State Univer -
sity Seminole logo have also been asked to 
change their symbol, said UF spokeswoman 
Janine Sikes.
“It’s not a UF or an FSU problem,” Sikes said. “It’s a nationwide issue of how do we 
deal with competing licensing agreements. 
And legally, the university has an obliga-tion to protect its trademarks.”
Glades Day School, one of the four 
schools that received a letter, will now have to spend up to $60,000 replacing the Gator logos around its campus, including on its basketball floor, all the school uniforms and even a statue in front of the building. 
Robert Egley, who heads the Belle Glade-
based school, said his school had been using UF’s logos since the school opened in 1965. 
He said the school did it as a tribute to 
the university. 
“Many of our alumni and members of The Gator Nation in Belle Glade are 
friends and family of The Gator Nation in 
Gainesville,” he said. “We love the Uni-
versity of the Florida. We would never do anything 
intentionally to hurt them 
or take money out of their pockets.”
Sikes said the issue 
that got the CLC’s atten-
tion was the sale of Gator-
branded merchandise. 
Egley said that Glades Day School was 
selling merchandise that carried the Gator 
logo. 
“Faculty and coaches know it’s a battle we cannot win,” he said. “It’s a battle we cannot afford to fight. They know we can’t 
win because legally we don’t have a leg to stand on.”
The three other schools that were asked 
to stop using the Gator logo were Ola High School in Ola, Ark., Palm Beach Gardens Community High School in Palm Beach Gardens, and Vicksburg High School in Vicksburg, Miss. 
“The University of Florida certainly em-
braces other programs that are Gators; we just ask that they create their own logo,” Sikes said. “If it’s out there on every Gator 
program, it’s no longer the mark of the Uni-
versity of Florida.” High schools must stop using UF’s logo
� YOUNG VOTERS ARE THE COUNTY’S LARGEST 
DEMOGRAPHIC WITH 34,098 REGISTERED.
By GEORGE PAPPAS
Alligator Contributing Writer
UF students won’t see Alachua County issues when they 
look at the general election ballot on Nov. 2 unless they’ve des-
ignated it as their legal place of residence. 
Student Government’s External Affairs is surveying stu-
dents and encouraging them to register in Alachua County by the Oct. 4 deadline, instead of submitting an absentee ballot from home. 
The county’s 34,098 voters in the 18- to 25-year-old age 
range make it the biggest demographic, said Pam Carpenter, 
the Alachua County supervisor of elections. 
 She said she acknowledged the student presence in the 
community, but that she has no way of knowing how many registered voters are UF students. 
“We’re pushing for students to have a big-
ger say on things in the place they live in for 75 
percent of the year,” said Jacob Burns, executive director of 
External Affairs. 
Party-affiliated student groups and Chomp the V ote are 
teaming up with Burns’ committee to increase voter turnout at precincts on and around campus and encourage a student response beyond the general elections this fall. 
He said he hopes to get city and county officials to lower 
gasoline taxes stemming from the road beautification pro-grams, reverse the underage drinking ordinance and keep 
bars open until 3 a.m.  to allow customers time to find a ride. SG, county push

More than 1,500 students and 
parents filed into the Santa Fe 
College gym Wednesday night, swinging white bags filled with 
college information and scanning 
the booths for something inter -
esting.
Wednesday night was College 
Night at SFC, and visitors took advantage of the chance to visit with more than 70 university representatives from across the country.
Cheyenne Sutton, a junior at 
Newberry High School, was sur -
prised that she could speak with  representatives from the featured 
colleges on a one-on-one basis, 
she said.
“I was expecting to sit down in 
an auditorium and just have col-leges come and talk about their 
programs and admissions and 
that sort of thing,” Sutton said. “I wasn’t expecting them to be per -
sonally talking to people as indi-
viduals and not as a group.”
Willie Finklin, an admission 
recruiter for the Florida Institute 
of Technology, said the event was a great opportunity for high 
school students to talk with an 
adviser and narrow down their college search.
He thinks the biggest mistake 
that students make is changing the questions they ask from booth 
to booth.
He said students asked a lot of questions about programs and leisure activities. 
Parents want to know about 
finances. 
“All of this is good informa-
tion, but you want to kind of com-pare the colleges, so you want the 
same information of what’s im-portant to you,” Finklin said.
Stacey Ledvina, the College 
Night coordinator, said the most important facet of the event is that it gives students a chance to become familiar with a variety of opportunities.
“It’s important that they know 
their options,” she said.
Paul J. Crawford, a representa-
tive from the University of South 
Florida, said the best part of his 
job is interacting with students and parents.
Rather than giving a speech to 
the people who visited his booth, 
he focused on answering their 
questions about college in gen-eral.
“It’s one of those times in a life 
where really, it could go either way for the students,” he said. 
It’s nice to help students find 
the right path that helps their fu-ture success, Crawford said.

On the Issues
By JOEY FLECHAS
Alligator Staff Writer
Providing grant funding for graduate students, plac-
ing more Redboxes across campus and adding a Re-
gional Transit System Bus Tracking Center in the Reitz Union mark just some of the issues the Unite Party plans to tackle on their platform.
Unite Party spokesman Micah Lewis said ideas were 
mined from platform-generating events held across cam-pus.
“All of the points are really tangible things we can 
deliver in an effective way,” he said.
According to the platform, Unite candidates want stu-
dents without immediate Internet access to be able to go to the Reitz Union and track on-campus and off-campus buses at a tracking center.
The party also plans to provide two online services: 
one to match students with tutors for all majors and clas-sifications, and one to offer discounts to national and lo-cal businesses.
Lewis said the programs could provide students a 
way for students to get involved.
The platform also introduces the de-
sire to establish an electric car service that would serve as a pilot program to 
improve campus transportation.
Lewis said the program could be em-
ployed through either a co-sponsorship 
with an outside company, like Zipcar, or through the purchase of electric cars 
and the creation of system akin to Student Nighttime Auxiliary Patrol service.
 “It would be a pilot program first, to examine its suc-
cesses and failures, and then it could be expanded,” he said.
“The idea is to provide for students in a cost-effective 
way, while saving energy.”
Graduate students are also addressed in the platform, 
something Lewis says should dispel the notion that Stu-dent Government does not address graduate student 
concerns.
The party wants to provide graduate students with 
travel grants, work to expand the Baby Gator program 
and increase safety within family housing.
Lewis noted the practicality of the platform’s goals.
“That’s always the focus of our party, and it continues 
to shine through on this fall’s platform.”Unite Party platform

Even though the 24 independent candidates in the 
upcoming Student Government election are running decentralized campaigns, they have still agreed to run 
on a common platform.
The Independent Coalition of Students’ platform 
includes some long-standing issues of debate, such as using online voting, switching from Webmail to Gmail 
and expanding free printing.
“The most important thing to realize is that there are 
a lot of issues on the platform that have been raised 
before,” said Neil Gundavda, spokesman for the newly 
formed coalition.
He said the candidates are still putting emphasis 
on their own ideas that pertain to their respective dis-
tricts.
Gundavda said all of the candidates are new to SG.
“All of the candidates are fresh faces,” he said.
The newcomers have brought new issues to the table 
for this election cycle, including reforming Gator Din-
ing Services options, working with Re-
gional Transit System to create a route dedicated to busing students to gro-cery stores and letting students keep their parking spots on game days.
“A lot of students think it’s not fair 
that students have to move their cars on game day,” Gundavda said.
According to the platform, candi-
dates in the coalition want to work with Gator Dining Services to create more meal plan options, expand af-ter-hours dining on campus and bring Wendy’s back to 
the Reitz Union.
Another suggestion is to push the university to part-
ner with off-campus restaurants so that students can 
use meal plans to eat out.
“If UF were to make a deal with Saigon Legend, you 
could use your meal plan,” Gundavda said.
The coalition also plans to address the issue of com-
pensation for SG’s highest positions, including presi-dent, vice president and treasurer. 
Gundavda said that a volunteer student government 
would be best, but he understands the need for small steps. 
“The fundamental goal is to get rid of them entirely, 
but we don’t object to compromise.”Independent platform

Widespread student participation in Student Gov-
ernment is the major theme for the Progress Party’s 
platform this fall.
Party President Dave Schneider said some of the big-
gest problems with SG are systemic, and that mass stu-
dent participation is discouraged. 
“It’s a convenient way for people to claim a mass 
mandate for students without actually having it,” he said.
Progress candidates want to increase SG’s use of in-
sourcing, which favors students over outside contrac-
tors for major programs. The SG-funded Bike Repair is 
an example of the practice. 
Schneider said that using in-house resources will 
provide students more ways to interact with SG.
“It’s a form of political participation,” he said.
According to the platform, Progress candidates want 
to address campus sustainability issues by adding more 
recycling bins to Gator Dining facilities, redesigning 
the campus sprinkler system and giv-
ing resident hall students the option to stop receiving paper advertisements in their mailboxes.
The party also announced its inten-
tion to help create a committee, made 
up of students and faculty, to work 
with the UF Foundation to ensure that university investments are sustain-
able.
Schneider said the UF Foundation should make pub-
lic its investment practices so that students can have 
input.
“We see that information as important in the fight for 
sustainability,” he said.
The Progress Party is also touting its candidates’ 
support for graduate students and graduate assistants. 
They plan to focus on increased funding for the Baby Gator program and fee deferments for graduate assis-tants.
Schneider noted the desire for a campus review 
board of the University Police Department as an impor -
tant issue for the party. 
During summer, student senators from all affilia-
tions passed a resolution calling for the creation of such 
a board.Progress Party platform

Armed with a fistful  of 
condoms and a slew of infor -
mation, Condom Miranda will 
be making a visit to UF this Thursday to educate students 
one of society’s most taboo 
subjects.
The event, which will be 
held today at  7 p.m. in the Bro-ward basement, is a part of the  Broward Area Council’s “Sex Talks,” a series of discussions designed to educate students on topics relating to sex.
A similar talk was held last 
year, and, according to BAC President Eleonora Meliksto-va, was very successful.
“There are more pressures in college, and the presenta-
tion shows you that you don’t 
have to be abstinent; just do it in a safe way,” she said. “When we can relate to a story, we’re more likely to listen.”
Melikstova went on to ex-
plain that Condom Miranda not only focuses on an im-
portant issue for 
college students 
but presents it in an entertaining 
way so students will want to participate. As opposed to el-ementary and middle school health classes, sex in college is not only comprehensible, but a strong reality for many.
The event is free and open 
to all. Refreshments and con-doms will be available.‘Condom Miranda’

Semester after semester, UF students are giv-
ing back to the community and helping local 
businesses get on their feet.
For the past nine years, the Students in Free 
Enterprise has been helping local, small busi-
nesses through its Small Business Consulting program. 
Groups of five or six students, led by team 
captains who are members of SIFE, consult with the businesses and develop marketing and busi-ness plans as well as assist them with financial 
work.
“It’s dependent on what the business needs,” 
said Josh Funderburke, assistant director of Ca-
reer and Leadership Programs at UF.
The consulting program is not picky about 
who applies, Funderburke said. It’s open to new, established and nonprofit businesses. They ap-ply before the semester begins and outline what they need help with in the application.
Last year, the program helped 17 businesses 
in Gainesville.“The teams were able to provide a valuable 
service,” Funderburke said.
Groups meet with the businesses once a week 
and present a deliverable, or an outline of pos-sible solutions, at the end of the semester. 
Mark Fazzini, a senior finance major who is 
currently a co-project manager with the pro-gram, said he was a team captain last year. He said his team helped form a market plan for In-
die Mundo — a music-sharing site for indepen-
dent musicians. 
“You don’t realize how hard it is to start up a 
business,” he said. “We got his business moving forward.”
Fazzini feels that working with the Small 
Business Consulting Program has helped pre-
pare him for life after college by giving him 
hands-on experience with local businesses.
“Working as a team, that’s benefited me,” he 
said. “It’s been a great real-world experience.”Students help local businesses
“You don’t realize how hard it is to start 
up a business. We got his business

Wednesday’s question: Should
 Timothy Taylor have been fired for his comments?
104 TOTAL VOTES39% YES61% NOToday’s question: Was thePhiladelphia Daily News’ ‘Top Dog’ headline in poor taste?Doggone shame
The Philadelphia Daily 
News found itself in its own doghouse Wednes-
day when its main front-page headline for a story about the 
Philadelphia Eagles naming 
Michael Vick starting quar -
terback read “Top Dog.” 
We’re no stranger to con-
troversy, and we realize we’re not perfect. Heck, we have to call ourselves The Indepen-dent Florida Alligator and be not officially associated with 
UF after we refused to stop 
printing abortion clinic clas-sifieds.
And Vick is most certainly 
no stranger to controversy. Convicted on dog fighting-related felony charges in 2007 and attempting the mother of all public relations reha-
bilitation programs, the new 
Eagles quarterback is still try-ing to rebuild his life.
A life that some of Vick’s 
dogs were not given the lib-erty to rebuild. A life some of Vick’s dogs were denied the chance to live. 
And we realize the Daily 
News’ headline was just plain unnecessary. 
Vick has served his time. 
He’s paid for his crime. He’s filed bankruptcy as a result. We don’t want to punish him forever.
But to continually refer to 
anything Vick-related in ca-nine terms for the rest of his life is in poor taste and only 
insults the atrocities merci-
lessly committed against Vick’s and other’s dogs who were forced to mutilate other dogs for human entertain-ment. 
Instead of continually in-
sulting Vick for the heinous crimes that have since past, 
we should use his example as 
a vivid memory of the horrors that arise from treating dogs as worthless possessions and slaves to our benefit.Is it over yet?
Economists say ‘great 
recession’ is done
 
It’s over.
After only a year and a half, making it the longest eco-
nomic calamity since World
War II, a group of economic know-it-alls ruled that the 
recession-to-end-all-recessions is officially over. 
Since December 2007, economic output has plunged 4.1 
percent, the number of unemployed has reached nearly 15 
million, and it’s just been generally harder for us to pay for stuff like … rent and food. 
We’re glad to finally see national newspaper headlines 
like “Stocks already reflect recession’s end” after the much-awaited announcement, but we know the truth of the mat-ter lies in headlines like “End doesn’t mean everything is good.” 
Because it doesn’t. Sure, the stock market might be looking forward, and it 
might have a history of strong gains in the early stages of economic recovery. But the announcement that the Great Recession’s chapter is closed means nothing to the nearly 15 million unemployed Americans and the millions more Americans who are still underemployed as a result of our financial catastrophe.
Because a Band-Aid doesn’t exist for a boo-boo this big. A 
simple announcement won’t immediately stop the bleeding from our greenback lacerations, nor will it piece back togeth-er families ripped apart from foreclosures
and induced homelessness. We’re glad to know economists think the Great Recession 
has been cleared for release, but a majority of Americans still have a long-term stay in the intensive care unit.
Women a plus in conservative politics
Queen Elizabeth I was an unexpected political genius 
dedicated to her country and her people in a man-ner that had been seen in few monarchs before her. 
Stepping into her position as one of the first female heads of state, Queen Elizabeth I brought the English people through 
both domestic and foreign crises in determined strides.
According to historians, Queen Elizabeth didn’t assume 
the throne having pretenses that she knew all the answers 
to society’s problems. Instead, Elizabeth made use of the advice of her counsels and would change policy approach-es when they became unpopular.  
Her outlook on leadership was determined, cautious 
and conservative, though as she showed the world, she was willing to act decisively to quash the immense foreign 
threat of the Spanish Armada. 
This mindset is exactly what our country needs. Cer -
tainly, her monarchical system of government is not what I 
am prescribing. 
It’s Elizabeth’s demeanor of a determined conservative, 
loyal to her people and unwilling to act out of rash self-interest but still able to challenge the greatest threats from abroad that I’m recommending.
I see this potential in the feminine leadership that has 
emerged lately in the Republican Party.
Meg Whitman and Carly Fiorina are both running 
strong races for governor and senator in California. Nikki Haley has an excellent shot at the governor’s mansion in South Carolina. Sharron Angle is running neck and neck with Harry Reid in Nevada. Her toppling of the leader of the Democrats in the Senate would be a political coup.
In Delaware, Christine O’Donnell’s come-from-behind 
primary win is getting national headlines, and it’s not out-
side the realm of possibility that her controversial candida-
cy could produce another win. 
And, of course, there’s Sarah Palin. Most unsuccessful 
vice presidential candidates fade quickly from the limelight, but Palin has held national attention for two years and con-tinues to command an enthusiastic following. Palin has both star power and a common touch, which  dazzles the right and strikes fear into the left.
And, while her critics repeatedly 
resort to an insipid lipsticked-hock-ey-mom attack, she is taking decisive stances on the country’s pressing is-sues and refuses to back down from the challenge. Though she made le-
gitimate political fumbles, the attacks against her are usu-ally vicious and personal.
So is Sarah Palin the next Queen Elizabeth? No. Instead, 
I’m pointing out that I’m glad to see the Republican Party 
look toward women for leadership as opposed to treating 
them as token representations of gender. And what of the Democrat’s queen?
Nancy Pelosi can barely make it off her upgraded mili-
tary jumbo-jet without running into her self-made dissat-isfaction. A recent Rasmussen poll shows that 59 percent of Americans do not think favorably of Pelosi, after she’s enacted more than half a decade’s worth of liberal policy agenda and tax-and-spend legislation. She lacks the vital 
conservative element of Queen Elizabeth’s success and 
risks her own political career, taking a trip to the guillotine this November.
It is an encouraging trend to see increasing female rep-
resentation within our political system. A large number of Republican women are running for major offices, and in the case of Sarah Palin and Michele Bachmann, they are being looked to for national leadership. It’s entirely possible that the first person to be addressed as Madam President will 
be a Republican. My hat is off to the female conservative 
leadership to whom the task ahead surely will be of regal proportions.

 HvZ not UF’s only intense game
  I agree with Sean Quinn’s column regard-
ing   Humans vs. Zombies. Players are far too 
intense and it reﬂ  ects negatively on the school.      I know another game where the same applies. A bunch of students wear pads, hit each   other 
and chase a man with a ball. Most students 
get into the game and some even paint them-selves! This barbarity reﬂ  ects horribly on this school as a learning institution. 
  In all seriousness, Humans vs. Zombies is a 
very fun, harmless game. Rules are in place to keep players from bothering non-players.
  Mr. Quinn should try playing in the next 
game. He might just change his opinion about 
whether this game embarrasses the school.
  Adam Lichtenstein 
 UF student HvZ safe for students
  I’m a human, both in the literal sense Mr. 
Quinn   deﬁ  nes in his column and in the Hu-
mans vs. Zombies game I participated in last 
week. The game provides harmless, alcohol- 
and drug-free entertainment to about 1,000 UF students.  
Somehow, Mr. Quinn found this to be 
objectionable. In an issue of the Alligator where I can ﬂ  ip a single page back and ﬁ  nd an article on Student Government shutting down due to a “demeaning” debate that included “cursing”   and “sexual references” 
and where the front page discusses the on-
going investigation in a rape at an on-cam-pus frat house, I have to challenge whether or not the players of Humans vs. Zombies are taking the game too seriously or whether Mr. Quinn is.

 HvZ is a great college memory
  The idea of an exaggerated tag at a respect-
ed university does seem childish, but there’s 
nothing wrong with that if it brings people together at UF and in schools across the coun-try.
  As a former player in two games and one 
of the referees in a third, I can easily say one of my best college experiences was Humans vs. Zombies. 
  I became closer to my friends who were playing, met many new ones and never had more fun playing what feels like a live-action 
video game.
  In fact, by the November game, research-
ers
  from other schools are coming to observe 
students playing for student
  interaction studies, bringing other schools 
closer to us.
  Everyone who organizes the game works 
very hard for those playing and the time frame is very carefully planned. It’s not during the 
time of a home football game and it’s at a time when exams are not as heavy.
  We want everyone to join in--to be a part of 
what can be a great memory.

� VOLTA COFFEE WILL HOST THE EVENT.
By TAYLOR DIXON
Alligator Contributing Writer
Deriving its name from the Japanese term for the sound of 
“chitchat,” PechaKucha Night is back again for a second gather -
ing.
The creative evening will take place Friday at Volta Coffee, Tea 
and Chocolate, 48 SW Second St., from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. The event 
will bring together Gainesville artists and locals for a night of ex-
hibition and conversation. 
The event is free and open to anyone with a creative idea to 
offer. There are nine presenters that will display their work in a simple format: 20 images with 20 seconds each to elaborate on each picture. 
The PechaKucha concept was created to keep presentations 
short, consistent and fast-paced.
Daniela Gorny, Volta employee and event 
organizer, said the first PechaKucha event over the summer was a big success but hopes 
that Friday’s event will be even better because more students are in Gainesville during the fall semester.
Presentations vary in subject, from photography to blogging 
to urban planning. 
UF graduate Laura Ettedgui will be one of the presenters for 
Friday’s PechaKucha. Her presentation is about the Solar Decath-lon Europe competition in Spain, in which UF students construct-
ed a solar-powered house. 
According to the PechaKucha website, great presentations are 
those that uncover the unexpected. “Some are incredibly personal, 
some are incredibly funny , but all are very different making each PechaKucha Night like ‘a box of chocolates,’”the website said.
Gorny said people are enthusiastic and have been submitting 
their work for upcoming PechaKucha gatherings.Fast-paced event

STATE
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
MIAMI — Florida will imme-
diately stop enforcing its ban on 
adoptions by gay people following a decision by a state appeals court that the three-decade-old law is un-
constitutional, Gov . Charlie Crist 
said Wednesday.
Crist announced the decision af-
ter the 3rd District Court of Appeal upheld a 2008 ruling by a Miami-Dade judge, who found “no ratio-nal basis” for the ban when she ap-proved the adoption of two young brothers by Martin Gill and his male 
partner.
“I’m very pleased with the rul-
ing on behalf of the Gills,” Crist told 
reporters in Tallahassee. “It’s a great day for children. Children deserve a loving home.”
The appeals court decision is not 
the final word on the law. Gill and the American Civil Liberties Union, which represented him and his part-ner, want the state to take the case to 
the Florida Supreme Court to obtain 
a final statewide determination on the law.
“If that continues to be their de-
sire, we would support that, and I think given the makeup of the cur -
rent Supreme Court they would have a very good chance to get a 
very good ruling,” said Crist, a for -
mer Republican running for the U.S. 
Senate as an independent.
Earlier this month, Crist’s cam-
paign issued a position paper sup-porting several gay rights issues he’d once opposed, including adop-tion rights.
The prohibition was first enacted in 1977 and is the only law of its kind in the nation, according to court re-cords. Arkansas and Utah ban any unmarried straight or gay couples from adopting or fostering children. 
Mississippi bans gay couples, but 
not single gays, from adopting.“Clearly, Florida’s law was the 
most draconian in the nation un-til today ,” said Robert Rosenwald, the lead counsel on the case for the Florida ACLU.
In a 28-page opinion, a three-
judge panel of the court noted that gay people are permitted to become foster parents or legal guardians in Florida, yet are the only group not allowed to adopt.
“It is difficult to see any rational 
basis in utilizing homosexual per -
sons as foster parents or guardians on a temporary or permanent basis, while imposing a blanket prohibi-tion on those same persons,” wrote Judge Gerald Cope for the panel. “All other persons are eligible to be 
considered case-by-case to be adop-
tive parents.”
The ruling came in an appeal of 
the 2008 decision by the state De-partment of Children and Families, which had urged the judges to con-sider evidence of what it said were risk factors among potential gay par -
ents. These factors, according to at-
torneys for the department, includ-
ed more sexual activity by children of gay parents and more incidents of teasing and bullying suffered by children from gay households.
The appeals panel said the 
state’s evidence did not back up those claims and that its “experts’ 
opinions were not valid from a 
scientific point of view.” DCF also now agrees, according to Wednes-day’s ruling, “that gay people and heterosexuals make equally good parents.”
DCF said in a statement late 
Wednesday it was analyzing the decision and would decide ahead 
of the 30-day deadline whether 
to appeal. The statement said the agency is trying to find “the balance between the value of a final ruling from the Florida Supreme Court versus the impact on the Gill fam-ily.”
Gill said he’ll take the case as 
far as he can if the state appeals. The yearlong wait for the decision 
has been agony, with him worry-
ing “week after week that my kids might be taken away.”Court affirms overturning state’s ban on gay adoption

The streets of Gainesville are alive and full of 20-somethings hungry for attention and affection. Everyone is looking to make a friend 
downtown, even if, sometimes, it’s only for the night. But walking into a crowded bar or club can be intimidating, especially when you’re new to the scene. Some people deal with this by getting sauced, you know, greasing the gears a little bit. Others, however, choose to forego the libations and face the night in full sober regalia. Avenue writers Richard Stehli and Kat Bein experience this firsthand, playing their own versions of “sober Steve” and “sloppy Sam.” Their dance floor diaries document their nights sip-by-sip — be it soda or vodka.i love the nightlife

Boys who like girls — and boys: Happy Bi Day
By ERIC KOSSINA
avenue contributing writer
From left to right: a woman, a man and an-
other man, all holding hands. I thought it was a 
pretty interesting sight too, not necessarily be-cause I was confused, but because I had never seen it before. I thought I never would either. 
Rather than walk up and ask for an interview, 
I decided to follow them. They reached the en -
trance to Library West and then all parted ways, so I sat down to think. Was that a genuine three- way relationship? 
Today is Celebrate Bisexuality Day, a day 
used to raise awareness to the legitimacy of an identity. It is aimed to give bisexuals the small-est of comforts.  Started by BiNet, “America’s 
umbrella organization and voice for bisexual, pansexual, fluid, queer-identified and all other of us ‘somewhere in between’” nineteen years ago, many bisexuals don’t even know it exists. 
I have heard people refer to bisexuality as 
a phase or stories of college experimentation, but the face of this orientation is evolving in the eyes of culture. Bisexuality is slowly becoming more accepted as a sexual identity and into the 
forefront of society although many are still con -
fused by its very nature.
Katie Nutter, a sociology graduate student 
specializing in bisexual research, has a hard time defining bisexuality. For her, it’s more than a sexual preference. 
“It’s an ability to break outside gender roles, 
but it’s also this ability to ‘pass’ as either that 
can upset some LGBT members as well.” Ka-tie’s research is more about how bisexuality is accepted in the workplace, how switching from a photo of your boyfriend on your desk to a pho-to of your girlfriend can change attitudes. She cares about the process that arises from the simplest of transactions, and in so, how accep -
tance can arise.
Bisexuality is a sea change; it says every -
thing you thought you knew is only the beginning, but it’s that constant unknowing that makes it hard to accept for many.  Bisexuals are a people 
who live their lives outside the 
demands of others, who think 
independently, who refuse to 
having things nailed into place.  Uncomfortable 
with certain aspects of both communities and sexualities they merely define what it means to be themselves, and move forward. “Maybe it’s not about nailing things down,” Nutter adds. “Maybe it’s about the process.”
Common stereotypes are that bisexuals are 
confused, in a phase that will pass after college or attention whores. That’s only for girls. Men, on the other hand, are impossible to be bisex-
ual. One homosexual experience is enough to 
have you labeled as gay for the rest of your life, and any reference to bisexuality has you labeled as confused. In fact, at the last Pride Student Union meeting, out of a congregation of about one hundred people only three were willing to speak to me about their bisexual identity. All were women.
“Straight people kind of have a worse stereo -
type, but they are more accepting,” says Jessica Moody, a political science senior. It’s this dis-
crimination from both communities that makes 
it hard for some to actually identify as bisexual. “Most women probably wouldn’t even date a bi man,” she continues. “They probably would just think he’s gay.” 
Moody has had her share of discrimination 
from both communities. Originally coming out 
as a lesbian, she now identifies as a bisexual 
after realizing she still has feelings for men. While her straight counterparts were fine with her decision, she says some lesbians were “so feminist they couldn’t be with any girl who had been with a man.”
When asked how they were going to celebrate 
Bisexuality Day, the bisexuals I interviewed had an interesting response. I half expected a typical collegiate answer along the lines of get drunk and party. “Live,” they all replied.By KAT BEIN

If there’s anyone in this town that 
can go out night after night, get stupid-
drunk and not die, it’s me. I’m Kat Bein, pro-rager and party journalist ex-traordinaire. My mission was easy: Hit 
the streets, get schwasted and meet 
people. Basically, do what I do every night, but do it harder.
Day 1: WTF is this story about?My co-author and I met at Speak -
easy Wednesday night, my usual spot. By the time he got there with some friends, I was already two shots, a 
beer and a whiskey sour deep into my 
night. 
It started out allright. Conversation 
flowed without much trouble. As I con-tinued drinking, I found things only be -
came easier until around 1 a.m. when I was suddenly sloshed and slurring. 
In about 20 minutes, I went from 
discussing Buddhist traditions and 
Japanese rituals to knocking over all 
the stools in the bar. Get it girl.
Day 2: Keep on truckin’By around 3 p.m. I’d finally stopped 
puking, which gave me enough time to eat, brush my teeth and meet Rich at Alcove to get started again.
After a couple of beers, we started 
wandering the streets and ended up at Silver-Q where my friends were get-ting down. Turns out I’m terrible at pool when I’m tore up. A few more shots in the system, 
a few more beers, and I start going through my phone contacts thinking, “I wonder what pair of skinny jeans is up this late.” Blame it on the alcohol? Day 3: Where is my mind?I’ve never been one of those people 
who blacks out, but by now I find there are whole parts of the night missing in my mind. I remember things from 
before and after, but what the heck 
happened in the middle? How did I get home? These are not things you want to be asking yourself, honestly.At The Top, I decide to stick to good 
ole beer and conversation, which is nice and helps me keep my sanity. I learn tonight that going out doesn’t always have to focus around dancing until you’re a sweaty mess and drink -
ing until your IQ drops lower than the dance floor.
Day 4: Go big or go homeWe meet at Neon Liger where I im-
mediately buy a Four Loko for myself and one of my new friends. (Author’s note: I’ve already had three beers.)
This is my night to shine, and I 
outdo myself. I dance on tables, take a face-plant to the cement, hold a cup for my friend to puke in, and (apparently) I start making out with a gay dude mid-
sentence. Now, that’s what I call class.
The next morning, I look back on 
Saturday night as possibly one of the 
most fun nights but also the night with the most holes. I’m still learning new things about what happened, and yes, I’m still planning on raging 110 per -
cent all day, every day. I mean, if I went through this week without ostracizing 
anyone and in fact made new friends 
along the way, then obviously I know what I’m doing. 
Conclusions!By the end of it, we’d all grown a lit-
tle closer and (maybe) knew each other that much better. That’s the good thing about getting drunk, you get to write 
your own endings the next morning. By RICHARD STEHLI
avenue writer
Alcohol is the life-blood of the 
nightlife in Gainesville, lubricating our 
conversations and glossing over the things we wish to ignore. My mission was simple but by no means easy: Go out and try to enjoy a full week of what Gainesville has to offer after dark, without having a single drink.
Day 1: Why am I doing this?My first night out wasn’t par -
ticularly fun. I couldn’t help but feel out of place without a drink in my hands, and what would usually be a thoughtful sip on my beer was re -
placed by a brief but awkward silence.  
Interestingly, I found myself swept 
up in the en masse lowering of inhi-
bitions that happens at Lux between midnight and 2 a.m., but I never reached a place that I would call “comfortable.”
Day 2: Keep on trying.We started at one of my favor -
ite haunts, but it wasn’t a good 
choice. It doesn’t matter how many 
good beers the Alcove has on tap when you can’t drink. Even pool, a sport I sometimes enjoy, wasn’t much better over at the Silver-Q.  
I spent some time trying, unsuccessful-ly, to hit on girls. I needed to find some -
one sober enough to avoid any ethical dilemmas but still intoxicated enough to think I was funny. The pickings were slim, and I passed the time fruitlessly.  
Blame it on the sobriety? No, it’s prob-ably just me.Day 3: This is my placeFriday’s happenings created 
a strange bridge between our worlds. My roommate and I met Kat and her friend at the Top and engaged in my favorite drunken ac-tivity: Sitting around and talking.  
Sobriety, which until this point I had been wearing around my neck like a ball and chain, completely failed to impede my enjoyment of the night. I relaxed in the company of friends. Lips were loosened completely without chemical enhancement. I was stone cold sober, and I was having fun.
Day 4: Go big or go homeOn paper, Saturday at Spannk is 
anything but my element. As a person interested in communication beyond drunken grinding, locations quiet enough for conversation are scarce. But, as I hit the dance floor of the Neon Liger, for reasons I couldn’t possibly explain, I suddenly started having fun.  
I started to pick out familiar faces from the crowd and struck up conver -
sations with strangers. It was easy to break the ice and meet new people because drunk or sober, we were all sharing in the everything of the mo -
ment, and we all showed up to have fun.
Conclusions!It may be a sad commentary on 
the way we live in Gainesville, but so-ber partying isn’t completely intuitive. It’s a skill that you have to develop, in-creasing the effectiveness and enjoy -
ment of your interactions as you learn the way of the teetotaler. If you’re tired of marinating your brain in Smirnoff and PBR every weekend, maybe you should try on the mantle of sobriety, 
and wear it around town. It’s a hard 
road to tread, but sometimes the wild-est nights are the ones most worth remembering. thursday, september 23, 2010   � ALLIGATOR, 11 10, ALLIGATOR � thursday, september 23, 2010

 by JARED MISNER 
alligator staff writer 
Dear Jared,I recently dated a guy who refused to have sex with me. He blamed it on some ridiculous reason. Regardless, I still gave him a BJ, and he ﬁ  nished in less than two minutes! Am I that good, or do you think he suffers from pre-mature ejaculation? Love,Great Expectations
 Well, Ms. Dickens, the ﬁ  rst thing 
I’m particularly interested in is this mysterious “ridiculous rea-
son” our little preemie used when denying you a trip around home plate. Did he re-
fuse to let you ride the love stick because 
you wanted him dressed head-to-toe as a woodland creature? Did you ask him to wear a diaper and call you Big Mama? Did you mandate he use his sweaty tube sock as a makeshift gag before doing the deed?
Or have you considered this: Maybe he 
just wanted to wait a couple days to get 
to know your middle name before he blew 
his load in 120 seconds?
These are all important questions I 
need answered before delving into your dick dilemma because the differences between these scenarios run the line be-tween ridiculous and moral.
But before we get down to business: You go, girl! Good for you for throwing mor-als to the wind and going at him like a bee to a rosebush! 
But back to our little situation. Sex is 
messy. It’s sticky and it’s complicated. It 
changes everything.
 Timing is everything in a decision this 
large and in charge. Was this a long-term, 
semester-transcending, heavy-petting fest? Or are we talking about a weeklong “dating” situation involving mostly body shots and booty calls?
Perhaps this might be our key to 
exactly the kind of “great expecta-
tions” you’re looking for and precisely 
why you might be settling for a pop ﬂ  y.Or perhaps you’re just re-ally good at what you do.There are select individuals who are just plain good students in the class of fellatio. Some people can write well. Others can work a calculator like an Asian on Adderall. And some can pass a pop quiz below the 
belts without studying.
I’ve never been a fan of the term “pre-
mature ejaculation.”Nothing’s premature 
about the Big O. When it’s time, it’s time.It might be frustrating for those not on the windward side of the happi-est place on earth, but at least you knew you deserve a gold star, right?Stay away from calculators, and you’ll be 
just ﬁ  ne.

Who wears short jorts? They do!  
   By JON SILMAN
 alligator staff writer
 
  Not wearing jorts is like trying to potty train a starﬁ  sh. 
It just doesn’t make any sense. Gators in jorts are the 
equivalent of a queen decked out in full regal attire: re-
splendent. For you nonbelievers, here’s our picks for the best-in-formal jort wear, for your visceral pleasure. “Eastbound & Down”
Like the comedy of Will Ferrell? 
“Eastbound & Down” is back, 
and the king of comedy, along-
side fellow comedian Adam McKay (the executive producers of the show), is kicking off its second 
season Sunday at 10:30 p.m. The show follows 
Kenny Powers (Danny McBride), an ex-major league baseball player who returns to his middle school to teach physical education. McBride’s character’s self-deprecating but tough-guy, I-don’t-care attitude is as hilarious as it is endearing. And not only are the show’s characters entertaining, but the crew – “Pineapple Express” director David Gordon Greene and “Observe and Report” 
writer and director Jody Hill – are also experts in 
making audiences laugh.
Hands All Over
Radio’s favorite crooner Adam 
Levine (and those other four guys 
from Maroon 5) are back this week with their 
third studio album after a three-year hiatus. Though the Los Angeles group mostly plays it safe on “Hands 
All Over,” sticking with the poppy-funky-sexy-ballady 
mix it’s known for, there’s a few standouts, like “Out of Goodbyes,” which features Lady Antebellum.“Wall Street: Money 
Never Sleeps”
Greed, manipulation, self-advance-
ment: Sounds like that economics class you took freshman year. “Wall Street” is a story about money and the measures one takes to get it, starring Michael Douglas, Carey Mulligan and Shia LaBeouf. In 
theaters Friday, the drama follows Gordon Gekko 
(Douglas), a washed-up, disgraced Wall Street trader who returns to the game after serving time in prison. Supposedly trying to ﬁ  x a severed relationship with his daughter (Mulligan), the money mastermind be-friends her ﬁ  ancé, Jacob (LaBeouf). But how does the saying go? Once a liar, always a liar. You can bet your $10 movie ticket that Mr. Moolah has other plans.
“A Teenage Parody”
He’s not exactly dreamy, but watch 
as this gawky YouTuber lip-syncs 
to Katy Perry’s No. 1 bubblegum jam, “Teenage Dream.” In the video, which has more than 6 million YouTube views, the bushy-haired brunette 
sways, grooves and busts several moves – without 
leaving the conﬁ  nes of his desk chair. There’s no skin-tight jeans, just lots of intense facial expres-sions, and it’s hard to tell whether his enthusiasm is serious or just plain mockery. Either way, Katy was deﬁ  nitely singing along, Tweeting her approval of the parody (“THIS... is my Teenage Dream”) earlier this month.

After beating ranked foes from the Big 12, 
Mountain West and Southeastern Conferenc-
es in the first nine matches of the so-called “Gator Gauntlet,” Florida closed its rough 
opening stretch by adding a fourth confer -
ence to the list. 
No. 3 UF defeated Atlantic Coast Con-
ference foe No. 13 Florida State 3-0 (25-23, 
31-29, 25-21) Wednesday in Tallahassee, bringing UF’s record to 7-1 against ranked 
opponents. 
Junior Kelly Murphy turned in her second 
consecutive triple-double — the 19th of her career — registering 11 kills, 11 digs and 20 
assists as the Gators (9-1, 2-0 SEC) earned their 19th consecutive win against the Semi-
noles (9-2, 1-0 ACC). 
“I’m so proud of Kelly because when it 
didn’t come easy, and she was just a little early on her approach, she didn’t get frus-
trated and she didn’t let it effect the rest of her match,” UF coach Mary Wise said. “Kelly 
just keeps battling.”
The entire match was a battle for Florida, 
as the team experienced 26 ties and 14 lead changes despite playing just three sets.  
Although each match and set this season 
has presented its own challenges, UF might 
have faced its toughest test in the second set  Wednesday.
Playing in front of a hostile crowd at 
FSU’s Tully Gymnasium, the Gators clawed back from a 17-10 deficit to tie the match at 
21. From there, the score stayed within one 
before Tangerine Wiggs and Callie Rivers re-corded back-to-back kills with the set tied at 
29 to give UF the 2-0 lead. 
“Talk about a gut check in set two down 
seven points,” Wise said. “I have to go (back)some to think about when I’ve been more 
proud of a group.”
“Our team battled and it was just one of those epic Florida-Florida State matches.”
As has been the case in a number of key 
matches this season, the Florida defense played a major role in the win. 
The Gators outblocked the Seminoles 12-9 
and outdug them 55-50. 
The defense was a total team effort, as four 
different UF players recorded double-digit 
digs, led by senior libero Erin Fleming’s 14. 
Fleming also chipped in five assists and 
led another strong Florida serving perfor -
mance with two aces. 
“Erin playing in this position is really the 
unsung hero, but she was a big-time hero to-night,” Wise said. 
Middle blockers Cassandra Anderson and 
Lauren Bledsoe gave UF an offensive lift, 
combining for 14 kills, just one error, and a 
hitting percentage of .650.
They also played a solid defensive game, 
as Anderson assisted on six blocks while Bledsoe had a hand in five. 
Bledsoe even contributed at the service 
line. Her ace clinched the match in her third 
consecutive service point. 
“She’s just such a gutsy performer,” Wise 
said. 
Tangerine Wiggs also had an efficient 
night on the offensive end, hitting eight kills 
and no errors for a .444 hitting efficiency. 
She also assisted on six blocks. 
“[Wiggs] gives us that true opposite across 
from Kelly,” Wise said. “Tangerine has been able to get us points both offensively and de-fensively this season.”
The FSU match concludes a stretch of six 
straight matches against ranked teams, the last three of which came on the road.

Despite carrying the ball a career-high 
26 times last week, Florida running back 
Jeff Demps said he has not felt sore.
Demps’ previous career-best was a 
16-carry effort last season against LSU, but 
he said coaches called his number about 20 
times per game at Groveland South Lake 
High.
The only pain he felt after Saturday’s 
game was his foot, which was stepped on by a Gators lineman in the first quarter. The junior limped on his right leg after the game.
“As a running back, you’re going to get 
tackled and it’s going to be hard,” he said. “You have to play through injuries. I’m used to it. I’ve played running back since I 
was about one. The only thing different is 
(playing against) bigger players.”
But running backs coach Stan Dray-
ton  said fatigue played a role in Demps’ fourth-quarter fumble, and he would pre-
fer that the tailback carried the ball less 
this week. Running backs Emmanuel Moody and 
Mike Gillislee combined for 13 carries Sat-urday.
“I definitely would like 
to balance that out   — for 
the sake of Jeff, really,” 
Drayton said. “He’s a 
burst guy. He doesn’t run 
the 800-meter dash. He 
runs the 100-meter dash. And to keep his legs fresh during the course of the 
game is going to help him and this football team.”Pouncey on Rainey: Center Mike 
Pouncey talked to Chris Rainey on Tues-day and said he believes the crestfallen re-
ceiver will return to the team this season.
“Oh yeah,” Pouncey said. “He’ll be 
back. We just don’t know when.”
When asked last week about Rainey’s 
status following his Sept. 14 arrest for ag-
gravated stalking, both coach Urban Meyer and offensive coordinator Steve Addazio said he was not on the team.
Pouncey is perhaps closer to Rainey 
than anyone else on the Gators. Not only Drayton to reduce Demps’ workload going forward

� Jets receiver Braylon Edwards’ DWI arrest prompted Rex Ryan to lecture 
his team about embarrassing the organization. Edwards, meanwhile, said he doesn’t see how the incident could be a black eye for the team. Doesn’t sound like anything that can’t be settled over a g****** snack. … Everyone who blasted Michael Vick for his cruelty to dogs better stick up for cats too after Vick plays my poor Jaguars this Sunday. “If we can get an elephant in here or 
something, we can get [Carl Johnson] 
some competition (in a food eating 
contest).”

NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
 
JACKSONVILLE — Jacksonville Jaguars 
running back Maurice Jones-Drew stirred up 
his fantasy football league Wednesday with talk he was ready to trade his best player.
He got some offers, even a couple of in-
triguing ones.
But Jones-Drew wasn’t quite ready to 
give up on his top draft pick.
“I’m not trading myself,” Jones-Drew 
said.
And neither should anyone else, Jones-
Drew insisted. Jacksonville’s star player be-lieves he’s on the verge of a breakout game, maybe even Sunday against Philadelphia 
(1-1).
“It should pop sooner or later, hopefully 
sooner for my sanity,” said Jones-Drew, who 
missed part of practice Wednesday with an ankle injury.
Jones-Drew has been mostly bottled up 
in Jacksonville’s first two games. He ran 12 times for 31 yards Sunday at San Diego, the eighth time in the last nine games that he’s 
been held under 100 yards.
He carried 23 times for 98 yards in the 
opener against Denver, but 34 of those yards 
came in the fourth quarter as the Broncos started showing signs of wilting in Florida’s heat and humidity. Before that late spurt, 
Jones-Drew averaged 3.8 yards a carry.
He averaged 2.6 yards 
a carry against the Char -
gers.
“Teams have been do-
ing a lot of good things 
against us by stacking the box,” Jones-Drew said. 
“We’ve been close a couple 
of times, but we’re just go-
ing to keep working at it.”
Jaguars offensive coordinator Dirk Koet-
ter counted 11 consecutive plays in which San Diego put eight defenders near the line of scrimmage and had one of the them blitz-
ing running plays.
How do the Jaguars (1-1) counter that?
“Defenses are going to be stacked un-
til we make them hurt for being stacked,” coach Jack Del Rio said.
That’s where quarterback David Garrard 
comes in. Garrard played one of his worst games against the Chargers, throwing four interceptions, getting sacked twice and miss -
ing two shots deep.
“You hit on a couple of those and they’ll 
loosen up a little bit,” Del Rio said. “Until you hit on some of those, they’ll be packed in there.”Jones-Drew expects to bust out of slump soon

If a mad scientist ever made a 
prototype for the perfect goalkeep-
er, it would be tall, quick, loud and fearless.  Meet Florida’s Katie Fraine. The 
5-foot-10 redshirt senior has all the attributes coaches look for in a goal-keeper, and fortunately for the No. 
7 Gators, she’s really good, too. 
The UF stopper has both the bark 
and bite to help guide the Gators to a fifth consecutive Southeastern Conference Championship. She’s 
one of two captains on Becky Bur -
leigh’s largest squad ever and an 
All-SEC performer with 20 career 
shutouts and a 0.88 goals-against average. This weekend when the Gators 
travel to Kentucky, the Titusville native will embark on her final SEC season. In a recent interview, Fraine 
spoke about her career and her se-
nior season.
What are you looking forward 
to most the rest of this season, and what would it mean to go 5 
for 5 on conference champion-
ships?
Fraine: “I just really want to 
win another SEC Championship. I’d like to have a ring for every 
finger. Winning a fifth champion-
ship would mean to me that I really contributed here. Before my class 
got here [Florida] hadn’t won it for 
three or four years, but as soon as my class got here we won one, then 
two, three, then four. To be able to 
take home a fifth one would prove to me that I’ve really helped this 
program move in the direction it 
wants to go.”
What is your proudest moment 
since coming to Gainesville?
Fraine: “Definitely last year’s 
SEC Championship. It meant a lot to me because it was the first one I’d done in net all on my own. It was just really special because we won 
and I got SEC first-team honors. 
It was special to be recognized for helping the team get to that point. Also going 11-0 (in SEC play) my 
sophomore year is a memory that 
I’ll never forget unless we do it again this year.”
Thinking back on your career, 
do you have a defining play or signature save you can remem-
ber?
Fraine: “As a keeper, I feel that 
every game has a defining moment 
that helps the team. To narrow down one would take away from 
the others, but coming up against 
Kentucky last year, I made a real sick save in the waning minutes 
that won us the game. That’s just 
one that stands out to me now that we’re about to go play them at their 
home.”
As captain, who are you most 
proud of this season? 
Fraine: “I can’t say enough 
about Mac (McKenzie Barney). 
She’s done such a great job pump-ing people up and really laying her 
heart on the line and being there 
for this team emotionally, psycho-logically when it really mattered. 
She’s scored some big goals for us 
and she’s always there in overtime to make a speech and get everyone 
fired up. She’s only a sophomore 
and I see so much potential for her. I’m so proud of her this year.”
What rival do you hate the 
most?
Fraine: “FSU is always a fun rival 
really , but Georgia is definitely my 
least favorite. I always get pumped 
up for that game because those girls 
are pretty rough. I don’t know what it is about them. South Carolina has done some disrespectful things to us in the past, so they’re another one 
we’re looking forward to playing 
and doing the best we can against them.”THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 23, 2010 � ALLIGATOR, 19

UF redshirt senior goalkeeper Katie Fraine has notched 20 career shutouts on her way to a 0.88 goals-
against average.
Moody returns to 
practice Wednesday
did the two play together at Lakeland High, but Rainey 
temporarily lived with Pouncey growing up.
Offensive Line Jells: After making his first start of the 
season last week, left tackle Xavier Nixon said the offen-sive line is getting back in sync.
Meyer wants the offense to lean on its veteran line, 
which returns four of five starters from last season. But 
Nixon’s knee injury in the preseason held the group 
back.
Nixon said the success of the line depends on chemis-
try among the five players up front, something that only comes with time. But the unit has quickly gotten back in 
tune because of its prior experience together.
“Right here, we have a foxhole mentality,” Nixon said. 
“When you have a line, you’ve got to know the man beside you is going to do his job and you’re going to do yours.”
Injuries: Moody (thigh bruise) returned to practice 
Wednesday after sitting out earlier this week. The senior 
suffered a thigh bruise in practice Sept. 15 and was limited 
to only five carries against Tennessee.
Defensive tackle Lawrence Marsh (hamstring, forearm 
laceration) has practiced at full strength this week, defen-
sive coordinator Teryl Austin said. Marsh sat out against Tennessee after cutting his arm when a bathroom sink col-lapsed last week. 
Tight end Jordan Reed (strep throat) missed practice 
Wednesday, Meyer said. Cornerback Cody Riggs and run-ning back Mike Gillislee missed practices last week with the same infection. NOTEBOOK , from page 17

Gators running back Jeff Demps gained 73 yards on a career-high 26 carries last week. Although Demps said he 
feels fine, running backs coach Stan Drayton wants to reduce his workload to keep him fresh.
Goalkeeper Fraine wants ‘a ring for every finger’By TYLER JETT

Looking at the schedule before 
the season, fans knew what to 
expect from a Kentucky-Florida 
matchup.
One team would sport a jug-
gernaut offense, accounting for nearly 500 yards and half-a-hun-dred points per game. And, based 
on the stat sheet, the other team 
would seem overmatched.
But who knew the Wildcats 
would be the ones with the offen-
sive firepower? 
Entering Saturday’s game, Ken-
tucky ranks second in the South-
eastern Conference in scoring (44.3 points per game) and total offense (497.3 yards per game).
“We’re facing the best offense 
we’ve faced so far,” UF coach Ur -
ban Meyer said. 
Hot starts aren’t new for the 
Wildcats, though. And, unfortu-
nately for their fans, early success 
has proved to be a mirage in the past. Since 2007, Kentucky is un-defeated in its 12 games before the 
start of SEC play, averaging about 
40 points and 437 yards. 
But the Wildcats’ offense cools 
once the conference season starts, averaging just 25 points and 387 
yards. Kentucky is a combined 13-
17 after those initial 12 nonconfer -
ence wins.
Like the three seasons before, 
Kentucky wants to prove this Sat-urday that its offensive success can 
translate into matchups against teams more respected than Akron 
and Western Kentucky, two of the Wildcats’ early victims.
“[The Florida game is] going to 
show us if we are going to be able to compete,” said running back 
Derrick Locke, who leads the SEC with 372 rushing yards. “It’s a big 
game for us. We are now in SEC play, and that’s what everybody wants to know — how good our 
offense can be against an SEC op-
ponent. We’ll see how it goes.”
Locke will be the second straight tailback to face the Gators as the conference’s leading rusher. Last week, Florida limited Ten-nessee’s Tauren Poole to 23 yards 
on 10 carries after he entered the 
contest averaging 136 yards per 
game.Kentucky could have more suc-
cess, however, by getting the ball 
in the hands of receiver/wildcat quarterback Randall Cobb, who 
has accounted for the fourth-most 
all-purpose yards in the SEC.
Facing a similar threat in South 
Florida quarterback B.J. Daniels on Sept. 11, Florida surrendered 244 rushing yards — 107 by Dan-
iels.
“We’ve got to prepare for those 
things,” UF defensive coordinator Teryl Austin said. “I’m sure we’ll 
do a better job than we did last 
time.”
Cobb has accounted for a com-
bined 1,801 yards rushing and 
receiving in his three-year career. But, with 665 yards passing, de-
fenses also have to account for his 
arm. Cobb is 2 for 2 with a touch-down this season. 
Since coming to Florida in 2005, 
Meyer said the talent at Kentucky 
has drastically improved. And 
the best example has been Cobb, a player Meyer said he couldn’t wait to see get “the heck out of 
this league.”
But even with more talent, Ken-
tucky’s offense hasn’t played well 
enough to snap a 23-game losing streak to Florida, a measuring stick for the Wildcats’ legitimacy.
“If we can do that, then our 
program can still rise,” Locke said. “And if we just continue los-
ing, our program won’t get any 
better. It’ll just be the same. We 
want people to look at Kentucky 
like, ‘Hey, these boys are playing ball.’ And not just basketball.”20, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 23, 2010
