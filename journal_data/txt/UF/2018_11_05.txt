It must have been tough for Feleipe 
Franks.
The loudest cheer Saturday afternoon at 
the Swamp came at his expense when quar-
terback Kyle Trask jogged into the huddle to 
relieve him of his duties for the day. There 
were mumbles of approval after Franks ran 
in a 3-yard touchdown to end the ﬁ  rst half, 
but the spectators had already made up their 
minds. The crowd was Muhammad Ali, and Franks was the punching bag. 
There are other lessons to be gleaned from 
the Gators’ abysmal 38-17 loss to Missouri 
on Homecoming. There’s the fact that nei-
ther Franks nor Trask were made available 
to the media following the game, showing a 
lack of trust in either to keep the ﬂ  ames from 
this 12-car pile-up of a game to a minimum. 
There’s the opinion that coach Dan Mullen 
holds that he can and will “kick your a--” 
if you challenge him to a thumb-wrestling 
match. 
Outside of the more comical lessons we all learned, here are three that any Gators fan 
can take to the bank.
They are who we thought they were
Florida entered the season with a low ceil-
ing. Most pundits predicted between six and 
eight wins in Mullen’s ﬁ  rst year. After an up-
set over then-No. 5 LSU and a comeback win 
against Vanderbilt, journalists and fans alike 
began talking playoffs.
But much like a preteen’s mood, Florida’s 
outlook is always changing. 
A pair of embarrassing losses have ex-posed plenty of issues this team still has. De-
spite  giving up just two sacks over the last 
two weeks, the offensive line play hasn’t ex-
actly helped the team’s ambitions of a New 
Year’s Six bowl. The front ﬁ  ve gave up seven 
quarterback hurries to the Missouri defense, 
which contributed to more than a few of 
Franks’ misﬁ  res.
“Feleipe missed a throw or two, but 
he’s also getting hit,” Mullen said. “We’ve 
got wide guys open, and I’m looking like, 
‘What’s going on?’ and then all the sudden Gators ﬁ  nd more questions than answers in loss to Mizzou

Los Angeles-based rapper Ty Dolla $ign, an artist in Wiz Khalifa’s 
label T aylor Gang Entertainment, puts on a show for students at 
Gator Growl 2018. The concert, which was held on Flavet Field, 
capped off Friday’s Homecoming celebrations and also featured 
alternative rock band Walk The Moon.
THE WEATHER DELAYED THE 
ANNUAL HOMECOMING EVENT BY 
ALMOST THREE HOURS. 
By Tranelle Maner 
Alligator Staff Writer
In all kinds of weather, the Gator still growled 
Friday night.
The annual homecoming pep rally was pushed 
back almost three hours because of thunderstorms 
that began around 3 p.m.
Festivities began at 8 p.m. with a performance 
from Ty Dolla $ign. The rapper performed hits like 
“Wavy,” “Or Nah” and “Paranoid.” He also brought 
out his cousin and fellow rapper TeeCee4800 dur-
ing the performance and attempted to bring crowd 
members on stage to take shots.
He mentioned his afﬁ  nity for Florida because of 
the relation to his longtime girlfriend and former 
member of Fifth Harmony Lauren Jauregui, who is 
from Miami. 
After a brief announcement of the homecoming 
court, guests were again met with a 45-minute de-
lay for Walk the Moon to take the stage because 
of a computer malfunction, the band’s lead singer 
Nicholas Petricca said during the show. 
Walk the Moon performed from 10 to 11 p.m. 
singing their most popular songs, including “One 
Foot,” “Anna Sun” and “Shut Up and Dance.” A 
guitarist wore a Gator football jersey during the set.
Because of the weather, Gator Growl ofﬁ  cials 
had to cut the introductory performances including 
Danza Dance Company, which won the group com-
petition at Soulfest last Sunday, said Stokes Patter-
son, a Gator Growl staffer. 
Will Engle, a Gator Growl director, said despite 
the weather altering original plans, the show was a 
success. The group held meetings days before the 
event playing out possible weather scenarios. Engle 
declined to comment on how many people attended Gator Growl hosts performances by 
Walk the Moon, Ty Dolla $ign

Megan Newsome felt nervous and giddy 
Thursday afternoon. She gathered friends and 
ate cake.
It wasn’t her birthday, graduation or wed-
ding. It was the day she voted.
Newsome was one of the 7,908 people who 
voted early at the Reitz Union for the ﬁ  rst time 
since it was reinstated as an early voting loca-
tion, said TJ Pyche, the Alachua County Super-
visor of Elections spokesperson. 
“I felt like we were waiting for a ride at an 
amusement park,” Newsome, a 22-year-old UF 
alumna and a former Vote Everywhere ambas-
sador, said. 
Newsome was a co-plaintiff in the lawsuit to 
allow universities to be early voting sites. An 
injunction allowed the Reitz to be a temporary 
early voting location for the midterm elections. 
The Reitz had the third-highest turnout out 
of the six early voting locations in Alachua 
County, according to the Alachua County Su-
pervisor of Elections’ website. The top spots 
were ﬁ  lled by Millhopper Branch Library and 
Tower Road Branch Library. 
In total, 40,882 people voted early this year, 
compared to the 17,983 people who voted in the 
2014 midterms, Pyche said.
It would be difﬁ  cult to argue against the new 
location’s impact on turnout, Pyche said. While 
a judge will decide whether college campuses 
can be early voting locations, each county’s 
supervisor of elections will make the ultimate 
decision.

Florida Museum hosting ‘The 
Lost Bird Project’
The Florida Museum of Natural 
History is now displaying “The 
Lost Bird Project,” an exhibit 
that includes five cast-bronze 
sculptures of the extinct Carolina 
parakeet, great auk, heath hen, 
Labrador duck and passenger 
pigeon. Artist Todd McGrain cre-
ated the statues as a tribute to 
endangered and extinct species. 
Ranging from 4 to 6 feet in height, 
the sculptures were permanently 
placed where each bird was last 
seen in the wild, ranging from 
Fogo Island, Newfoundland, to 
Okeechobee, Florida, with travel-
ing exhibits of the same figures 
touring nationally. For more in-

NEWS FROM AROUND FLORIDA 
Man says he wrestled with gun-
man during yoga studio shooting
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — A 
man trying to stop a shooting at-
tack on a Florida yoga studio said 
Sunday that he wrestled with the 
attacker after his gun jammed, a 
move credited with giving oth-
ers time to flee the rampage that 
killed two people and wounded 
six others.
Yoga student Joshua Quick spoke 
to ABC’s Good Morning America 
on Sunday and said he grabbed 
Scott Paul Beierle’s gun after it 
jammed and hit him.
Tallahassee Police have identified 
Beierle as the man who posed as 
a customer to get into the studio 
Hot Yoga Tallahassee during a 
Friday night class and started 
shooting. Police said Beierle, 40, 
then turned the gun on himself, 
but authorities have offered no 
motive for the attack.
Quick said Beierle was able to 
grab the gun back and then pis-
tol-whipped him.
“I jumped up as quickly as I 
could,” said Quick, who had vis-
ible facial injuries. “I ran back 
over and the next thing I know 
I’m grabbing a broom, the only 
thing I can, and I hit him again.”

OPINIONS
EDITORWhich is it — a murderous band of disease-ridden invaders 
working diligently to bring terrorism and havoc into our country 
or a group of women and children walking slowly toward the 
U.S. ﬂ  eeing gang violence and seeking asylum?
Depending on which cable news channel you’ve been watch-
ing, you probably have one of these two conceptions of the mi-
grant caravan. Issues like immigration have a history of dividing 
our nation along party lines. While America’s party divide on 
immigration is not a new story, the difference in news coverage 
of the migrant caravan is unusual. If you are asking yourself why 
the split on this issue is so severe, take note of today’s date. The 
midterm elections are Tuesday, and both parties are jockeying for 
positions in battleground states. Make no mistake: The caravan is 
being used as a boogeyman to scare voters.
When you vote, please take a careful look at all the informa-
tion available to you. Avoid far-fetched theories even if they come 
from the president himself.
When President Donald Trump tweets about the caravan, he 
makes it seem like the sky is falling. Trump tapped out this frantic 
message a few weeks ago on Twitter: “Criminals and unknown 
Middle Easterners are mixed in (to the caravan). I have alerted 
Border Patrol and Military that this is a National Emergy (sic). 
Must change laws!”
There is no evidence of individuals from the Middle East pos-
ing as migrants. Trump also implied that people from the Middle 
East are inherently dangerous, an idea teeming with prejudice 
and misinformation.
When a group of migrants got into a violent confrontation 
with Mexican law enforcement, Trump issued a heavy-handed 
response at a press conference Thursday. “Anybody throwing 
stones, rocks, like they did to the Mexican military where they 
badly hurt police and soldiers of Mexico, we will consider that a 
ﬁ  rearm,” essentially saying that if migrants were to throw stones, 
they would be met with a hail of bullets.
This might seem like an extreme response to Democrats 
watching MSNBC, but to Republicans placing their trust in mem-
bers of their own party and Fox News for information, a harsh 
response might seem appropriate. Fox News coverage has em-
phasized the potential health risks of letting the migrants into the 
country. A guest on Fox said migrants in the caravan were carry-
ing leprosy, smallpox and tuberculosis, and the migrants would 
“infect our people in the United States.”
Fox had no way of independently conﬁ  rming that claim.
Why is the migrant caravan being framed as a threat to our 
national security? Why is Trump vaguely alluding to Middle East-
ern terrorists’ involvement in an immigration issue happening 
half a world away? 
Trump and company are playing a classic game of misdirec-
tion. To see why some conservatives are making such a stink 
over the migrant caravan, think back to a few weeks ago when 
the story started gaining traction in major news outlets. What 
was the major story then? Maybe it was the killing of Washing-
ton Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, who is thought by Turkish 
ofﬁ  cials to have been killed by agents from Saudi Arabia, a key 
Trump administration ally. Saudi denials of its own involvement 
fell apart throughout October, creating a political oil ﬁ  re that 
Trump could only extinguish by detonating an even larger story 
to starve the Khashoggi scandal of oxygen. A murdered journalist 
does not play well with voters going in to the midterms.
We’re left with less than two days before the polls close Tues-
day. We urge our readers to take the migrant caravan story with 
a healthy dose of skepticism. Vote for candidates who will work 
on health care, the economy, education and the environment. 
Try not to focus on fringe issues like the caravan, which are last-
minute attempts to stoke fear and increase turnout of a voter base 
already postured to vote along party lines.Column
Don’t let fake news fool you in this governor’s race
There’s only one day to go before voters head 
to the polls and vote in one of the most bit-
ter gubernatorial races. Through news re-
ports, campaign ads and numerous online 
sources, people have been bombarded with 
information about each candidate. Unfortunately, 
not all of that information has been true, and 
myths and “fake news” about both candidates 
have abounded in this election cycle.
Andrew Gillum, the Democratic candidate for 
Florida’s Governor, has been a target of misinfor-
mation. For example, during a gathering of supporters for his 
opponent, Ron Desantis, on Oct. 15, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio 
claimed that after Hurricane Michael hit Tallahassee, Gillum 
— the mayor of Tallahassee — “stood in the way of crews 
being able to come in and restore power” and kept the city 
in the dark because the crews were part of the wrong union. 
Fact-checking site PolitiFact rated that claim “False.” For 
one thing, while Michael did leave 90 percent of Tallahassee 
customers without power, a report from Leon County found 
that most people had their power restored within a week, 
contrary to Rubio’s claim that the city was without power for 
weeks on end. Michael struck Tallahassee on Sept. 1, and by 
Sept. 8, the state emergency response team tweeted that only 
2 percent of Tallahassee customers were without power. In 
addition, while the city of Tallahassee didn’t jump on an offer 
from Florida Power & Light to help restore power, eight other 
companies were already working to restore power at that 
point. In any case, decisions over whether to help to restore 
power were not Gillum’s responsibility; rather, they fell to 
Robert McGarrah, Tallahassee’s general manager of energy 
utility. Finally, PolitiFact found no evidence that union status 
was a factor in deciding who could restore power; ofﬁ  cials 
involved in the process like the former head of the Florida 
Municipal Electrical Association reported that union status 
played no role in the process. Even the city’s own crews who 
helped to restore power were not unionized.
However, Gillum isn’t the only candidate facing misin-
formation. Republican gubernatorial candidate DeSantis has 
also faced untrue allegations. At a June 28 Fox News debate, 
back during the Republican primary when DeSantis was run-ning against Florida Commissioner of Agriculture 
Adam Putnam, Putnam claimed that DeSantis 
“voted in an agricultural bill to give food stamps 
to illegal immigrants.” DeSantis responded during 
the debate, “that’s not true, you know that, come 
on.” Indeed, it isn’t true. According to PolitiFact, 
the bill referenced here is the 2014 federal farm 
bill and in addition to the usual provisions of farm 
bills like reauthorizing crop subsidies and regulat-
ing food assistance beneﬁ  ts like the Supplemen-
tal Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Section 
4015 mandated that states would be “required to use an im-
migration status veriﬁ  cation system” when distributing food 
assistance beneﬁ  ts. While DeSantis voted against that bill, 
that does not mean DeSantis wants to give SNAP beneﬁ  ts to 
undocumented immigrants. For one thing, SNAP is already 
limited to citizens, so those in the country illegally are not 
eligible for SNAP regardless of the provision passing. Second, 
DeSantis explained after the vote that he voted against the 
bill because he thought it was a “bad deal for taxpayers” and 
did not do enough to cut the costs of the SNAP program — 
not because of any issue related to illegal immigration. Politi-
Fact thus rated Putnam’s claim “Pants on Fire,” indicating an 
extremely false and misleading claim.
While some would say misleading claims and half-truths 
are emblematic of politicians and politics, outright lies and 
misinformation help no one. A popular saying states that “a 
lie can travel halfway around the world before the truth can 
get its boots on.” That is even more true in the age of the 
internet. When fake news proliferates, rational political dis-
course breaks down as we debate talking points at best to 
outright hoaxes at worst. So, before you head to the ballot 
box Tuesday, do your research; reputable organizations like 
the League of Women Voters provide excellent and nonpar-
tisan voter guides, and I highly recommend using them. And 
before you cast your ballot, ask yourself this: Am I basing my 
decision on informed and rational analysis or on misinforma-
tion and fake news? The answer might surprise you.

Letters to the Editor“Looters take advantage of New Orleans 
mess,” “Police thought 12-year-old Tamir Rice 
was 20 when they shot him,” “Felon and Uni-
versity of Chicago professor share the stage in 
speech about felon rights.”
What do all of these headlines have in 
common? They serve to disparage the voices 
and narratives of people of color. Within this 
context, The Alligator further perpetuated the 
silencing and erasure of marginalized people 
with its article that was published last month. 
On Thursday, Oct. 11, UF Intersections, 
which is funded by the Andrew W. Mellon 
Foundation, hosted an event that focused on 
humanizing the effects of mass incarceration. 
Typically, when we think about mass incarcer-
ation, we think about the issues we read. We 
focus on the words that pop out of our screens 
or off of our pages. This event successfully pro-
vided a platform for real people whose work within the criminal justice system breathes life 
into those very words.
Reuben Miller and Jhody Polk shared their 
invaluable insight into mass incarceration by 
prompting us to interact with the system rather 
than merely study it. At one point during the 
talk, Miller asked us to reimagine how we as 
a society can respond to offenses we consider 
criminal. Polk then challenged us to venture 
out into the Gainesville community and inter-
act with those we normally would avoid. Over-
all, this event was an opportunity for students, 
faculty, staff and community members to re-
think the definition of a just society. As such, 
when the title of the article downgraded this 
momentous occasion to “Felon and University 
of Chicago professor share the stage in speech 
about felon rights,” the entire event was not 
only denigrated, but The Alligator became 
complicit in cultivating the damaging narrative 
of people of color that is subliminally present-ed to the public.
Polk cannot be relegated to simply a felon. 
She is an organizer. A mother. An advocate. 
Despite her past she is worthy of more than 
a deprecating label. When Polk and Miller 
spoke, they challenged us to see the people be-
yond these labels. This is extremely important 
because it requires us to consider their human-
ity before judging them. When the media re-
ferred to people of color who were ravaged by 
Katrina as “looters” instead of families devas-
tated by a natural disaster fighting for survival, 
we only saw their crime and not their circum-
stances. When the media labeled a 12-year-old 
child with a toy gun as a 20-year-old with a real 
weapon, we were given the imagery that there 
is nothing wrong with the adultification of chil-
dren of color. When the staff of The Alligator 
chose to call Polk a felon in spite of the other 
titles she currently holds, they conveyed the 
message that the work Polk is doing does not matter. The Alligator implied that Polk must al-
ways be judged by her past actions and not by 
her present accomplishments, her community 
service and her unrelenting push to remain a 
productive member of society.
Words matter. Titles matter. Humanity 
matters. As members of the media, you have 
an innate responsibility to write with integ-
rity, decency and morality as you amplify 
your words to the impressionable public. We 
are disappointed that Polk was demeaned and 
purported as a degrading label that does not 
capture the amazing dialogue she provided 
about her past as well as the opportunities to 
bridge the gap between UF and the Gainesville 
community.

Straw-straight, golden sun-lit strands 
sway as she moves — this is beautiful 
hair.
Coffee-bean-colored locks catch the 
sunlight and spiral toward it. This is beau-
tiful hair.
Then why is it that society seems to be 
actively programming us to only see the 
first as beautiful? I am black, and I am a 
woman. And like most women, whenever 
I go through a significant change, so does 
my hair. The summer before I started college, I cut 
all my hair off, just like the white girl in the movie. 
What white girl? What movie? It doesn’t matter. 
What matters is that I cried after as it hit me that 
just because our reasons for cutting our hair were 
the same, our hair texture was not. She had a pixie 
cut, and I had a black dude fro. Notice that I did 
not say that my black dude fro was ugly or that 
her pixie cut was cute. This is to say that all hair is 
beautiful, and while it does not define us, it does 
lend itself as a tool of self-reflection. And maybe 
if I had seen a black girl in a movie doing the big 
chop, I wouldn’t have cried… as much. In a soci-
ety that shallowly seems to operate on a basis of 
physical attraction, it is not shocking that with the 
European standard of beauty so pervasive, only 
16 percent of women in films of 2017 were black. 
The European beauty standard associates attrac-
tive people with those who have the most Euro-
pean features, including straight hair. As a result, 
for hundreds of years too long, black women and 
their hair have been pressurized and insulted un-
der white beauty standards.
And so, despite the one-sided illusion that 
white supremacy has inflicted upon society, I’m 
writing this not to convince you or myself that 
black hair is beautiful. No matter your race, wake 
up and see this: Black hair is beautiful.
It is well-established that white beauty stan-
dards forced upon black culture have had a det-
rimental effect on black women, as they are sub-
jected to endless messages of the seeming ideal. 
This effect can devastate a child’s self-perception 
as young as age 3, as seen in Clark and Clark’s 
Doll Test of 1947. In this experiment, 253 black 
children between ages 3 and 7 were shown two 
identical dolls, one black and one white. About 
two-thirds of the children indicated that they liked 
the white doll better in spite of their own skin col-
or. In fact, when the study was conducted again in 
2005, the findings were similar. One young black 
girl chose the black doll when asked which doll 
“looked bad.” And then when asked to choose the 
one that looked like her, the girl touched the white 
doll at first and then, with a painful look in her 
eyes, chose the black doll.
Just the difference of skin color can lead to 
lower self-esteem and, in some cases, self-hatred. 
Now imagine adding other black features like 
curly or kinky hair. Let’s break the chain for both 
us and future generations, and in the same way 
we’ve come to celebrate black history, black cul-ture and African heritage, let’s cel-
ebrate black hair.
Black girls and women need to 
see themselves on television, and 
not as sassy sidekicks or sexual ob-
jects, but as everyday women rock-
ing their everyday hair. On the red 
carpet, actress Zendaya wore her 
hair in beautiful faux dreads, swept 
to the side. TV personality Giuliana 
Rancic stated that the dreads looked 
like they smelled of patchouli oil or weed. This 
blatantly insinuated that black hair is not elegant 
or beautiful according to Rancic’s white suprem-
acist beauty standards. Zendaya has a huge fan 
base, especially among young black girls, so it 
was important that she rocked those dreads and 
then further declared Rancic’s comments as igno-
rant and offensive, and most importantly, imperti-
nent to the beauty of black hair. “There is already 
harsh criticism of African American hair in society 
without the help of ignorant people who choose 
to judge others based on the curl of their hair,” 
Zendaya said. “My wearing my hair in locs on an 
Oscar red carpet was to showcase them in a posi-
tive light, to remind people of color that our hair 
is good enough.”
It is great to see actresses like Zendaya, Aman-
dla Stenberg and Yara Shahidi bringing light onto 
black girls and women. But black women are more 
than just caramel-colored with lengthy loose curls.
Powerful strides to diversify our representation 
are being made through inspiring actresses such as 
Lupita Nyong’o, Issa Rae and Viola Davis. Seeing 
Davis in “How to Get Away with Murder” take off 
her makeup and wig was unforgettable. She was 
vulnerable. Her character was vulnerable. And I 
felt that her being seen made me feel seen as well. 
We need to see all types of black women. We need 
to see black women unafraid to own the beauty of 
their black hair. We need to see black women go-
ing to bed or waking up with their heads in wraps, 
scarves, bonnets or pineapples (loose ponytails to 
preserve curls while you sleep). This is our real-
ity and our hair. How we take care of it or style it 
should not fill us with shame or insecurity.
Our weaves, wigs, bantu knots, twist-outs, Sen-
egalese twists, box braids, cornrows, frohawks, 
blowouts, freshly relaxed or permed tresses, our 
curls and kinks are all beautiful and should be rep-
resented. The image of that little black girl choos-
ing the black doll with defeat broke my heart. I 
am a black girl that was raised in white suburbia, 
and whether it was school or the next hit rom-
com, I was reminded that I would never have the 
long, blonde swaying hair, and to me, that meant 
I would never really be beautiful. The secret to 
beautiful hair is that I was both right and wrong. 
I would never have long, blonde swaying hair. I 
am beautiful.

opinions@alligator.orgIt was Summer semes-
ter, and I was failing a 
class. My depression left 
me bedridden and con-
stantly crying. I couldn’t 
do my work, let alone attend 
class. It was unexpected. I 
didn’t know what to do.
UF doesn’t advertise the 
medical petition well, so I 
didn’t know it existed. Then when I 
found it, I still struggled with it.
Medical petitions are there for “un-
expected situations,” like a death or 
health problem that interfere with your 
academics. Students can either submit 
them retroactively or currently and 
drop certain classes or all of them.
For students with mental health is-
sues, the process is far too hard.
Here’s why:
Your teachers need to know
Professors are jaded from excuses. 
Many professors won’t give extensions 
because “then I’d have to give one to 
everyone.” When you start missing 
or failing assignments, your teachers’ 
first reactions won’t be sympathetic. 
They’ll probably think you’re just an-
other easy-A chaser.
When my depression resurfaced, I 
only hinted at its existence. My profes-
sor initially said I just wasn’t manag-
ing my time well and that students 
with similar workloads were doing 
fine. He eventually wrote a favorable 
letter for my petition after an unex-
pected change of heart.
You may not even know how to 
explain the situation. It’s hard enough 
to tell loved ones, much less someone 
who doesn’t know your name. You’ll 
have to decide: phone, email or in-per-
son? Then, how emotional or stone-
faced should you be? It’s a hard line 
to toe. 
You need a therapist
The Counseling and Wellness Cen-
ter put 6 percent of students on a wait-
list to see a counselor in the 2016-17 
school year. Those deemed dangerous 
to themselves or others get first dibs. 
The rest must loiter in the abyss. When 
I spoke with a counselor in 2015, she 
suggested group therapy for my social 
anxiety. (Spoiler alert: I was too anx-ious to go.)
My triage appointment 
last semester was my third 
attempt at getting help. The 
counselor told me to find 
a long-term therapist off-
campus. She provided a few 
names, and one accepted 
me. After three appoint-
ments, I felt worse. Then, 
during my last session, I learned I had 
$45 in backpay. I stopped going.
Finding a good therapist when you 
have no money or time is a night-
marish endeavor, but without it your 
words are just hot air. You can’t di-
agnose yourself, even if you know 
fantasizing about getting cancer isn’t 
normal.
You’re judged on paperwork
Having to convince a board of 
strangers of your honesty is both in-
sulting and disingenuous. Anyone can 
pretend to be suicidal for a therapist. 
People can be fooled by great actors, 
or they can overlook a real problem 
because it wasn’t written well enough. 
You must provide the board with 
an essay in chunks of questions about 
your adverse experience. I worried I 
was writing either too dramatically or 
too logically. In any case, something 
was wrong because my petition was 
denied. I guess I wasn’t really de-
pressed. But how would they know? 
They’ve never met me. 
Being judged solely on paperwork 
is not a common practice after college. 
Even in job applications, you usually 
get an in-person interview. The medi-
cal petition process implements no hu-
man contact, and that is unfair. 
Medical petitions are far from per-
fect in their current state. I would ask 
that universities reconsider the process 
to better accommodate struggling stu-
dents without letting liars get a free 
pass. In-person interviews should be 
conducted, and students shouldn’t be 
punished for not having a counsel-
or’s letter. Students with broken legs 
shouldn’t be made to jump through 
hoops.

LIBRARIES ARE FUNDING 
DISPENSERS AND PRODUCTS.
By Angela DiMichele
Alligator Staff Writer 
Heather Halak dreaded having to run 
to the bathroom down the street when 
she was a UF student.
The Computer Science and Engineer-
ing building didn’t have small trash cans 
in the bathroom stalls for her to throw 
out menstrual products, she said. But 
Weimer Hall did.
The unplanned trips to Weimer made 
the now 25-year-old UF alumna late to 
class. 
“When you’re on your period, you’re 
already not feeling your best,” Halak 
said. “And this is an added thing.” 
Three years after she graduated, 
about 3,000 tampons and 1,000 pads will 
be available at both Library West and 
Marston Science Library by Friday.
The 4,000 products are the first order 
for the menstrual product pilot program, 
said Marston chair Valrie Minson. The 
products cost the George A. Smathers Li-
braries about $400 and will be restocked 
as needed until the program is reviewed 
in January 2020. 
“The library is very careful with our 
funds and how we expend them, but 
we do take it very seriously — making 
academic life accessible for all,” Minson 
said.
Halak said providing menstrual prod-
ucts for students is a matter of empathy. 
It would have been a quick walk from 
her classes near Turlington Plaza to Mar-
ston in case she had an emergency. “If someone is telling you to shut up 
and buy your own pads, but they’re hap-
pily getting their Viagra covered and free 
condoms, it is incredibly anti-feminist 
and misogynist,” Halak said.
A clear, tapered dispenser will be in-
stalled in the first-floor family restroom 
in Marston. Two dispensers will be in-
stalled on the second floor inside and 
outside of one bathroom for everyone 
to access, Minson said. Three dispensers 
will be in Library West in the second- 
and third-floor bathrooms. 
UF Panhellenic Council funded the 
dispensers for $864, Panhellenic presi-
dent Madi Rigdon wrote in an email.
The dispensers come about 10 months 
after UF’s Student Government Budget 
and Appropriations Committee voted 
down a proposal to use students’ Activ-
ity and Service Fee to fund the products. 
SG was not involved in installing the 
dispensers or products in the two librar-
ies, Chase Werther, founder of Gators 
Matter, Period., said. She and five other 
students have worked with Minson since 
May to get the products at the libraries. 
Though Werther is excited for stu-
dents to have more access to menstru-
al products, she said working with SG 
slowed the process down. 
“It could’ve been done within a 
week,” Werther said.

restore voting rights for nonviolent felons and “Bring it home!” in support of

Taggers won’t back down.
Tom Petty’s memorial mural on the SW 
34th Street wall usually reads, “Gainesville’s 
No. 1 son.” But the mural was vandalized Sun-
day with a large blue and white tag blocking 
half of the message from view. 
Blake Harrison, a 55-year-old local artist, 
said it was the largest tag he’s seen since he 
began taking care of the mural about a month 
after it was painted last October. 
“It doesn’t really matter to me who did it,” 
he said. “It just happened.”
An anonymous female artist painted the 
mural following Petty’s death on Oct. 2, 2017, 
Harrison said. He asked the artist if he could 
add a portrait of Petty to the vivid red heart in 
the center of the mural. 
“There’s not another Tom Petty out there,” he said. 
Harrison has been cleaning up the tags ev-
ery few months with help from fans and the lo-
cal Sherwin-Williams location, which donates 
paint. He said he’ll continue to take care of the 
mural as long as he’s in Gainesville. 
“Public art has a transient nature to it,” Har-
rison said. “Certain murals get tagged on and 
then they get fixed because of their precious-
ness to the community.”
Daniel App, the co-founder and lead guitar-
ist of Heavy Petty, a Tom Petty and the Heart-
breakers tribute band, said he was glad the de-
facement didn’t happen during the Tom Petty 
Birthday Bash. 
App was disappointed but not surprised, he 
said.
“Let a legacy be a legacy,” he said.

ABOUT 30 PEOPLE

Verisha Afzal smiled from ear 
to ear as she served hot meals to 
people she had never met before 
Sunday afternoon. 
About 30 people gathered at 
Gainesville City Hall to eat freshly-
baked pasta, salad and bread pre-
pared by the Pakistani Students’ 
Association at UF. The group set up 
two tables with home-cooked pasta 
dishes and bread rolls in front of 
the building as people lined up to 
be served. 
Afzal, a 20-year-old UF nu-
tritional sciences junior and the 
group’s internal vice president, 
helped organize the annual event 
to encourage students to become 
engaged in community service. The 
group’s board members bought the 
groceries out-of-pocket. 
“We want to make sure that we 
are reaching out to people who are 
not as fortunate as us,” she said. 
“We are lucky to not have to worry 
about where our next meal is com-ing from.”
About 15 UF students volun-
teered to serve lunch. They baked  
the pasta dishes and casseroles for 
the food drive in the morning at the 
Chase Hollow apartment complex, 
where the group usually holds 
meetings, Afzal said. 
Gainesville residents were en-
couraged to eat as much as they 
pleased as they sat on benches and 
talked with club members. 
Ibrahim Ragab, a 21-year-old UF 
biology senior, joined the club this 
semester to hang out with friends 
but volunteered for the drive to 
help those in need. 
Ragab said preparing the meals 
as a team was his favorite part 
about volunteering for the food 
drive. 
He sat with residents after serv-
ing them to make sure they were 
enjoying their meal. He wanted 
them to feel welcome, he said.
“It is so easy to forget that there 
are people who are not nearly as 
lucky as you in life,” Ragab said.

helping hand when you get the 
chance.”Pakistani Students’

While Krishna Bhattarai worked with farm-
ers in a Ugandan town in May, he noticed no-
body ate lunch. 
The 30-year-old UF environmental hor-
ticulture doctoral student was one of 10 UF 
students chosen to participate in international 
agricultural research projects to help farmers improve food production, he said. 
“I asked them, ‘What do you eat for lunch?’ 
and they told me they don’t,” Bhattarai said. 
“That was something that intrigued me.”
The Trellis Fund is a program that connects 
U.S. graduate students from UF, North Caro-
lina State University, University of Hawaii at 
Manoa and University of California, Davis, to 
organizations in Africa, Asia and Latin Amer-
ica, said Brenda Dawson, the Feed the Future 
Innovation Lab for Horticulture at UC Davis communications coordinator. A total of 16 stu-
dents were sent this year.
Food insecurity is a major issue for the 
mushroom and tomato farmers in Kira Town, 
Uganda, he said. Most people only eat two 
meals a day, so he wanted to help for the 12 
days he was there in May.
Bhattarai, a tomato breeding expert, taught 
farmers the importance of drip irrigation, how 
to make tomatoes last longer and how to test 
soil for diseases, he said.“Even though I came with a background in 
tomato breeding, I also learned a lot,” Bhat-
tarai said.
Dawson said the response from UF students 
was incredible. The program builds partner-
ships between students, like Bhattarai, and 
organizations to continue to working together, 
Dawson said.
“They’re tomorrow’s agricultural research-
ers,” she said.UF students sent to Africa to help farmers feed themselves

during the Boosie Badazz concert, police said. The coordinator was shot once in the chest and 
was taken to a local hospital.
The coordinator is expected to live, police 
said.
Smith ran away through the large crowd be-

Police found Mojica holding onto 
the driver’s side door handle in the

damage to the car that appeared to be 
worth more than $200.
He later told police that he was

on a homemade drug Thursday. 
Gary Wendell Norman, 64, 
Crystal Lynn Manos, 33, Han-
nah Brook Riddlespur, 28, and 
Rhonda D. Tompkins, 31, were 
arrested by police investigating 
10 medical emergency calls made 
from Grace Marketplace, at 3055 
NE 28th Drive, according to a 
press release. 
Thirteen people were taken 
to hospitals after overdosing on 
“Spice,” a synthetic drug made to mimic the effects of marijuana, 
the release said.
Police got several reports of 
sick people along Northeast Wal-
do Road at about 4:30 p.m., the 
release said. At least 13 people 
were taken to hospitals because 
they showed symptoms associ-
ated with taking Spice. 
A police dog smelled drugs 
inside a closed car at Grace Mar-
ketplace. Norman, the driver, and 
the three women were inside the 
car, according to arrest reports.
Police found 6.5 grams of sus-
pected spice in three plastic bags, sandwich bags of crystalline pow-
der and a syringe with a clear un-
identiﬁ  ed liquid, the reports said.
Tompkins had half of a white 
pill with “411” on it inside a small 
bag. A small piece of Spice was in 
Riddlespur’s bra, the report said.
Manos dropped a cigarette box 
holding three blunts containing 
less than a gram of Spice, the re-
port said. 
All four people were arrested. 
Jail staff found two bullets in Ma-
nos’ purse, police said.
Norman, Manos, Riddlespur 
and Tompkins were all charged with possession of a controlled 
substance and of drug parapher-
nalia. Manos was also charged 
with possession of a ﬁ  rearm by a

Dr. Kayser Enneking is accused of 
using her UF email address to cam-
paign. 
Charles Goston, a registered Dem-
ocrat running as an independent for 
Florida Senate District 8, ﬁ  led a com-
plaint against his opponent Ennek-
ing, claiming she used UF resources 
to support her campaign. 
“We live in a city where there 
is so much racism and animos-
ity toward anybody like myself who stands up and speaks out for the 
truth and really just do my job as an 
elected ofﬁ  cial because they don’t 
want my kind,” Goston said. 
Goston said he received word 
from a member of Enneking’s team 
claiming she violated state law by 
using her work email to discuss her 
campaign and her UF Health proﬁ  le 
page to post articles referencing her campaign. 
Chapter 106.15 of Florida statutes 
states “a candidate may not, in the 
furtherance of his or her candidacy 
for nomination or election to public 
ofﬁ  ce in any election, use the ser-
vices of any state, county, munici-
pal, or district ofﬁ  cer or employee 
during working hours.” If found in 
violation of this section, she could be 
penalized with a ﬁ  ne of up to $1,000 
if the conviction is a ﬁ  rst-degree mis-
demeanor.
“Anytime you get a major viola-
tion like that, you’re supposed to re-
port it,” Goston said. 
Goston also claimed Enneking 
used references to UF in her cam-
paign ads to appeal to audiences. He said the university is a state 
institution, and candidates do not 
have the luxury of using it as a back-
drop.
Enneking, who ﬁ  lmed a TV ad-
vertisement at Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Sta-
dium, used the locale because it’s 
public property, and it’s where she 
routinely exercises, said Jake Fla-
herty, Enneking’s campaign manag-
er. Any reference to UF is removed, 
he said.
“You don’t have to get permis-
sion,” Flaherty said. “There’s no 
guards.”
Flaherty said the team has not 
received any notiﬁ  cation from the 
Florida Elections Commission, so 
the complaint may not be ofﬁ  cially ﬁ  led, yet. Emails provided by Goston 
neither conﬁ  rm nor deny Enneking 
used her UF email address. 
Flaherty said Enneking created 
many connections over the 30 years 
she’s worked at UF Health, and 
many people use that email as her 
primary form of contact. Any emails 
sent to her work mail are redirected 
to her personal email, he said.
“We have been very careful to 
use our campaign email account or 
Kayser’s personal email account for 
any pending communication about 
the campaign,” Flaherty said.

the ball sails and I’ll jump on him and 
there he is with three guys being pulled 
off the top of him.”
Locker room culture has a ways to go
This isn’t an opinion. This comes 
straight from Mullen.
“Either you’re a competitor, or you’re 
not,” Mullen said. “Certainly I hope that 
rubs off and that’s the attitude of every 
single guy in the locker room.”
That answer resulted from a question 
about Mullen’s assessment of the team’s 
response after the loss. It underscores the 
message he has been preaching from the 
beginning: physical and mental tough-
ness.
“I think that’s the hardest reality for 
us as a team,” Mullen said. “It’s a little 
bit of a reality check where we are with 
the guys, that you know if we come out 
and play really well as a team in all three 
phases, we’re good enough to play with 
anybody out there.”
The quarterback question isn’t get-
ting solved this year
Franks and Trask will be forever joined 
at the hip in the annals of Florida sports. The prevailing notion among fans seems 
to be that Mullen should go with Trask 
through the rest of the season. 
It’s a tempting thought only because 
fans haven’t seen much of Trask in high-
stakes situations. It has mostly just been 
in the second half against Mizzou. He 
went 10-of-18 for 126 yards and a touch-
down, eclipsing Franks’ passing totals 
from last week and Saturday. 
But that’s in the middle of a blowout. 
The Tigers had reverted to a prevent de-
fense, mostly looking out for deep passes 
and allowing most anything Trask wanted 
underneath. 
It may have been emotionally satisfy-
ing for fans to see Trask toss a touchdown. 
It was a decent throw in a fourth-and-goal 
situation. But the fact remains that Mullen 
still sees Franks as his best option to win 
this year.
“It’s always been a pretty tight deci-
sion,” Mullen said. “Feleipe’s got tremen-
dous arm talent, pretty good athletic abili-
ty to go run the ball and then, to be honest 
with you, he, in practice, does a good job 
of checking us in, getting us in to the right 
plays and honestly grades a little higher.”
@MorganMcMuffin
mmcmullen@alligator.orgFOOTBALL,  from pg 1Dan Mullen: ‘Either you’re a competitor, or you’re not.’
Christopher King / Alligator Staff
Quarterback Kyle Trask took over for Feleipe Franks with five minutes to go in the third 
quarter in Saturday’s 38-17 loss to Missouri. He led a scoring drive in his first series. 
The lost city of Alanis / Column
Success has a way of disguising 
flaws.
A team’s blemishes vanish from 
memory almost instantly if it’s a 
victory when the clock hits zero. 
That is, until the winning stops. 
When that success fades, those 
same weaknesses that were previ-
ously ignored are forced under a 
microscope.
Every mistake that marred the Gators in their 
38-17 loss to Missouri on Saturday has been evi-
dent at one point or another this season.
They were a top-15 team heading into this 
game -- and top-10 ahead of their matchup with 
Georgia -- so no one cared to emphasize those 
seemingly minor shortcomings.
The offensive line has picked which plays to 
execute on all season, not just in the losses.
Example: Florida’s 37-27 win over Vanderbilt.
One play every guy on the O-Line picks up 
his blocks and knows where he’s supposed to 
be. And it yields a 30-yard run from Jordan Scar-
lett or Lamical Perine. But then another play, 
one of the tackles gets beat off the ball and is 
left swiveling as one of Vanderbilt’s pass rush-
ers whirls past him to gift Feleipe Franks with a 
hefty slam to the ground.
But who cares? They won. 
Franks has been just as hit or miss this sea-son, but the criticism had subsided 
so long as his team continued its suc-
cess. 
The redshirt sophomore had two 
turnovers against Vanderbilt that 
somehow weren’t a concern until a 
week later when he turned the ball 
over AND the team lost.
Then on Saturday, Franks looked 
like every bit of his football acumen 
had been stolen by the Monstars before he took 
the field. And those same Florida fans who’d 
lauded his development during that five-game 
winning streak booed him more and more vi-
ciously with every incompletion.
Coach Dan Mullen described Saturday’s loss 
as a needed reality check for his guys. One that 
would drain some air out of their inflated heads. 
“We had some success,” he said. “We won 
some tough games, and all of a sudden you 
start patting yourself on the back and thinking, 
‘Boy, we might have some answers we can go 
home to.’”
But it was a reality check for fans too.
Amid the cries of what has happened to the 
Gators during this two-game skid is the reality 
that the remnants of that team that went 4-7 last 
year are still there. And they have been all season.
Everyone was just too busy basking in the 
unexpected triumphs to care.Gators’ issues during loss were nothing new

Seven wins, 10 losses, and four ties.
It’s a far, far cry from last year’s re-
cord of 17-7, 2016’s record of 17-5-1 and 
2015’s record of 19-4-1. Becky Burleigh’s 
2018 campaign with the Florida Gators’ 
women’s soccer team was marred by her 
first regular season losing record and two 
separate streaks of goalless play, both 
instances her squads have seldom ever 
experienced. Her team proved during its 
SEC tournament run that the program 
won’t be declining any time soon despite 
the poor play across the season.
The season started off typically for the 
Gators. After a 4-0 romp in an exhibition 
against FGCU, they bested Washington 
and breezed past FAU to start the season 
2-0. 
It was during the team’s next six 
matches when the first disaster struck. 
The team went scoreless for six straight 
games, shattering the team’s previous re-
cord of three set in its inaugural season in 
1995. Florida lost five of those games and 
found itself reeling as it began conference play with a 2-5-1 record.
Conference play started out smooth-
ly. Although it dropped its first match 
to Vanderbilt 2-1, UF came back to de-
feat Kentucky 6-0 and LSU 4-1. It finally 
seemed as if the Gators’ squad the world 
used to know was prime to re-emerge in 
the final stretch of the season.
That is, until their ghost had come to 
haunt them once again.
Florida’s scoreless streak returned, 
and the team played its next four matches 
without finding the back of the net, los-
ing two of those matches and tying in the 
others.
The team closed out the last three 
games decently. The Gators dropped a 
match to a very poor Missouri squad but 
bested Georgia and took an impressive 
win over Arkansas that guaranteed them 
a spot in the SEC Tournament.
Auburn -- the Gators’ first matchup in 
the tournament -- had finished their sea-
son 12-5-1. It wouldn’t have been surpris-
ing to see the team fall out of the wildcard 
round, considering the team’s late stretch Becky Burleigh’s first losing season 
found redemption at its end

VOLLEYBALL

Paige Hammons lined up for a serve in 
the second set donning her bright, high-
lighter orange headband and smacking her 
gum as she had done every match previous. 
Her serve slapped the tape of the net, but it 
crept over the side and fell just out of reach 
of three Arkansas defenders, causing them 
to look up in the rafters of the O’Connell 
Center and wish they were as fortunate.
It’s sometimes better to be lucky than 
good. But it’s even better to be both, and 
the No. 11 Florida volleyball team was in 
the four-set win (25-20, 15-25, 20-25, 15-25) 
over the Razorbacks on Sunday to mark its 
1000th win in program history.
“It feels great,” Hammons said. “I’m re-
ally excited to do it with this group of girls.”
The match did not start off with all 
smiles, however. Thayer Hall stood on the 
sidelines in a white, baggy shirt and blue 
sweatpants watching her team struggle in 
the first set. The Gators were without their 
high-flying freshman for the third-consecu-
tive match with an undisclosed injury, and 
they felt the impact.
Florida committed five attack errors and 
just a .194 hitting percentage. The offense 
lacked consistency and a spark from the 
back row with Hall out.
Arkansas libero Okiana Valle also gave UF trouble. The 5-foot-2 senior stood tall 
against the barrage of attacks, logging five 
digs in the first set and 15 on the match.
“We just had to hit away from her,” 
coach Mary Wise said. “Hit away from her. 
Serve away from her. She played very well 
tonight.”
After the rough start, though, Hammons 
took over. Her hard hits and consistent de-
fense shifted the momentum and created 
runs that helped UF rally back. In the second 
set, Hammons hit back-to-back kills to help 
take Florida’s first lead in the set. She then 
started an 8-1 run later with two sprawling 
digs, one from her knees. Both runs helped 
put the set out of reach and tie the match.
Hammons followed that up in the third 
set with two service aces in a 7-1 run to put 
her team up.
The rest of the team followed suit. Mid-
dle blocker Taelor Kellum and outside hitter 
Mia Sokolowski completely overwhelmed 
the Razorback defense, combining for 22 
kills.
Fifth-year setter Allie Monserez finished 
the match with 44 assists and five digs in 
the comeback win.
“It definitely feels good to come back 
home and get a win,” Monserez said. “It 
feels like forever since we’ve played here 
last and had a game where we really find 
our rhythm.”
The Gators will have a full week to rest 
before they travel to play Auburn on Nov. 11. It remains to be seen if Hall will return 
for that match, but Wise said that she and 
the rest of the coaching staff are confident 
in Hall’s return, they just don’t know when.
“We don’t have that one player we can just jump on the back of,” Wise said. “We 
need point production out of everybody 
from this match on forward.”

Women’s team rebounds af-
ter tough opening day
One of the reasons junior Tsveta 
Dimitrova wanted to transfer to the 
University of Florida was to chal-
lenge herself. 
She found — and overcame — 
that challenge this weekend after 
losing her first match on Friday and 
needed three more wins on Satur-
day to stay alive in the consola-
tion bracket. She won them all and 
walked away from the Dick Vitale 
Clay Court Classic with a consola-
tion championship in singles play. 
The junior started off her Satur-
day reeling off a pair of 6-3 wins 
against Virginia Tech’s Shene Dis-
bergen before facing off against Na-
talia Serrano of UCF. 
Dimitrova dropped the first 
game but responded with a 6-4 
win in the second game. She then 
dominated the tiebreaker 10-3 to 
advance to the final round of the 
consolation bracket. 
The Bulgarian native’s final 
matchup was Boston College’s Na-
tasha Irani, but Irani defaulted the 
match, giving Dimitrova the conso-
lation championship. 
Katie Kubicz also made a brief 
run in the consolation bracket. She 
defeated UCF’s Valentina Martin 
6-0, 3-6, 10-7 before losing to Irani 
2-6, 4-6. Dimitrova and freshman Mar-
lee Zein teamed up on the doubles 
court to take on TCU’s tandem of 
Stevie Kennedy and Aleksa Cveti-
canin in the doubles quarterfinals 
but lost 8-5. 
The first day of the tournament 
ended with relative disappoint-ment. 
Zein was a bright spot in Lake-
wood Ranch, Florida, on the first 
day of competition. The freshman 
started her weekend off with a 
hard-fought 6-2, 6-4 win over Ap-
palachian State’s Jeannez Daniel 
to advance to the Round of 16. She had two of the Gators’ three wins 
on Friday before she was bounced 
from singles play in the Round of 
16 with a 2-6, 1-6 loss to Oklahoma 
State’s Catherine Gulihar. 
Zein teamed up with Dimitrova 
to represent the Gators in the dou-
bles bracket. The duo edged out 
Julia Ascua and Patricia Villary of 
FGCU 7-5 to advance to the second 
round. Dimitrova and Zein’s next 
match against Kennedy and Aleksa 
Cveticanin of TCU was suspended 
due to inclimate weather.
This was the team’s next-to-last 
event on its fall slate. The team 
will be divided to play in either the 
Florida State All-Conference Show-
down or the Oracle ITA National 
Fall Championships. 
“Overall, we didn’t play our 
best tennis this weekend, but we 
absolutely competed way better 
today,” said women’s tennis as-
sistant coach Dave Balogh in a re-
lease. “I’m looking forward to see-
ing us build on this next weekend 
for our last Fall event.”
Men’s team makes champion-
ship push, falls short
UF freshman Lukas Greif took 
down Navy’s Greg Durham 6-2, 
6-1 in the singles round of 32, and 
senior McClain Kessler took care 
of business against Notre Dame’s 
Johnathan Small 6-1, 6-2. Fresh-
man Harrison Cacciatore and 
sophomore Brian Berdusco were 
swept by Princeton’s Will Peters (0-6, 3-6) and Bill Duo (3-6, 2-6), 
respectively.
Greif and Kessler each won in 
the singles Round of 16 to move 
to the quarterfinals, where they 
both stumbled. Greif lost to Notre 
Dame’s Axel Nefve 4-6, 5-7, and 
Kessler fell to Illinois’ Noe Khlif 
6-7, 1-6.
The duos of Greif and Berdusco 
and Kessler and Cacciatore teamed 
up in the doubles Round of 16. 
Greif and Berdusco defeated Lou-
isville’s David Mizrahi and Juan 
Paredes 6-3 to advance, while Kes-
sler and Cacciatore dropped their 
first match to Oklahoma State’s 
Emile Hudd and Brady Draheim 
4-6.
Greif and Berdusco made their 
way to a semifinals match with 
Chase Wood and Richard Thon-
goana of rival Florida State. Wood 
and Thongoana defeated the 
Gators doubles team (4-8) to end 
the weekend.
This was the last action of the 
for the fall season for Cacciatore, 
Greif and Kessler. As for the rest 
of the team, Berdusco, Ingildsen, 
Duarte Vale and Andy Andrade 
will travel to Surprise, Arizona, for 
the Oracle ITA National Fall Cham-
pionships. Berdusco and Ingildsen 
qualified for the doubles draw af-
ter their regional championship 
victory, while Ingildsen, Vale and 
Andrade all earned at-large bids for 
the singles draw. The champion-
ships begin Wednesday Nov. 7.Dimitrova finishes strong, men sputter at end of tourneyAlligator File Photo

BASKETBALL

Scottie Wilbekin and Patric Young donned 
the orange and blue the last time the Florida 
basketball team scored a win against rival 
Florida State. 
That was back in 2013. The Gators pro-
gram has undergone a leadership change 
since then, as legendary coach Billy Donovan 
left for the NBA’s Oklahoma City Thunder. 
Coach Mike White has led UF to back-to-back 
NCAA tournament appearances after earning 
only an NIT bid in his ﬁ  rst year.
But there’s one thing White hasn’t been 
able to achieve during his three-year tenure 
in Gainesville: a victory over the hated Semi-
noles.
He’ll have the chance to do just that on 
Tuesday night, as the 2018-19 squad will take 
the court against No. 17 FSU. This will be 
the ﬁ  rst time Florida has opened the season 
against Florida State since 2000-01.
Memories of last year’s 83-66 home loss 
still sting the veteran-heavy team. UF entered 
that game ranked ﬁ  fth in the country after a 
near upset of top-ranked Duke. The Gators 
spiraled after losing to the Seminoles, drop-
ping games to eventual tournament darling 
Loyola-Chicago and Clemson. Florida was out 
of the top 25 not even two weeks later.Senior guard Jalen Hudson said all he 
remembers from the 17-point loss is being 
dominated.
“On every aspect,” he said. “Rebounding, 
running the ﬂ  oor. I think they even shot bet-
ter than we did.”
White won’t have to worry about game 
planning against FSU’s leading scorer from 
last year, as forward Phil Cofer injured his 
foot in October and will miss an undisclosed 
amount of time.
The Gators should still be concerned about 
senior guard Terance Mann. Very concerned.
At 6-foot-7, he could present a matchup 
nightmare for UF. Last December, Mann hit 
11 of his 17 shots for 25 points against the 
Gators. He also grabbed eight boards.
“He just seems like a coach out there on 
the ﬂ  oor,” White said. “Good at everything. 
Good driver, good shooter, great feel, re-
bounder, defender, the whole thing.”
Mann won’t present the only matchup 
problem for Florida. 7-foot-4 center Christ 
Koumadje towers over UF starting center Ke-
varrius Hayes. The slightly undersized Hayes 
(6-foot-9) has struggled in his career when 
facing size in the front court.
Opening against a bitter rival -- one that is 
coming off an Elite Eight appearance no less -- 
will present a challenge the Gators don’t usu-
ally receive when they open with a mid-major opponent at home. But White says he might 
actually prefer it this way.
“...If we don’t have a great week leading 
into this game, it’s a lot different than hav-
ing an average week leading into a guarantee 
game and playing a low-major team,” White 
said.Hudson concurred with his coach.
“I love games like this,” Hudson said. “I 
live for games like this. I never had a season 
where your ﬁ  rst game is a really tough com-
petitor and a rival.”
@TylerNettuno
tnettuno@alligator.orgGators look to end losing streak to ‘Noles in season opener
and early opponent.
Except they didn’t.
The Gators defeated Auburn 
in penalty kicks to advance to the 
next round, where they would face 
a No. 1 seed Vanderbilt that had al-
ready defeated them earlier in the 
season. Surely this was to be the match where the team would exit 
the tournament.
It wasn’t.
UF not only defeated Vander-
bilt, but also shut out its offense 
completely, upsetting the SEC’s 
best team.
Even though the team would exit 
the tournament in the next round 
after taking Arkansas to overtime, ending its season, Florida’s im-
probable tournament showed that 
it refused to die quietly.
The future still looks murky de-
spite the Gators’ solid end to their 
season. The team’s senior class 
consisted of 10 students this year, 
and impact veterans such as goal-
keeper Kaylan Marckese and mid-
ﬁ  elder Lais Araujo won’t be with the squad when it suits up in 2019. 
Still, not all hope is lost. For-
ward Deanne Rose, gone for most 
of the year due to international 
play, will still be on the squad to 
lead the team during her junior 
year at UF. The team’s younger 
players, such as defender Georgia 
Eaton-Collins and forward Madison 
Alexander, showed promise in the 2018 campaign.
With Gators veterans departing 
and younger players ready to take 
center stage, coach Becky Burleigh 
has one thing to prove when 2019 
rolls around: This year’s team was 
the exception and not the new 
norm.
