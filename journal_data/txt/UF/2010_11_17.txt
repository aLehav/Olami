Alachua County Commissioners 
met informally Tuesday afternoon 
and discussed what to do about the sheriff’s appeal to the state Cabinet 
for more funding. 
Sheriff Sadie Darnell is appealing 
to the Cabinet for $507,451 more than the $65,034,686 sheriff’s budget ap-
proved by the Commission in May.
It is unknown how long the ap-
peal process will take, but Commis-sioner Mike Byerly thinks it could 
last a few months.
“I would guess that it would defi-
nitely go into the oncoming year,” he 
said in an interview.
If the process stretches into Janu-
ary , it could put Darnell’s request 
in front of Repub-
lican Governor-elect Rick Scott.
This fall, Dar -
nell appeared in a campaign 
commercial for Alex Sink against 
Scott, in which the sheriff said, “Rick 
Scott’s company was guilty of record 
Medicare fraud.”
Darnell was traveling on Tuesday 
and could not be reached for com-ment. 
Last year, Darnell returned  a 
surplus of $711,905 that her depart-ment did not use. She has asked that the commission allocate money from 
those funds to meet her request.
Lee Pinkoson, the new chairman, 
said he thought the Commission wouldn’t grant the requested budget 
change just to stop Darnell’s appeal. 
Most of the commissioners said 
Two Kentucky men sentenced in bizarre beard-eating case
LAWRENCEBURG, Ky. (AP) — Two cen-
tral Kentucky men were sentenced to proba-
tion in connection with a bizarre case in which a third man said he was forced to eat his beard after an argument. The Lexington Herald-Leader reported 47-year-old Troy Holt and 51-year-old James Hill were sentenced Tues-day.
Harvey Westmoreland of Lawrenceburg 
had said Holt cut off his beard and forced him to eat it while Hill allegedly held a sickle blade to Westmoreland and his brother during the May incident.
Holt could not say why he made Westmo-
reland eat his beard other than that things “got out of control” after some heavy drinking.
He added, “I ain’t got no excuses about 
what I done.”
Hill had no comment after sentencing.As a condition of their sentences, neither 
Holt nor Hill is to have contact with Westmo-reland.

Tonight, University Police will be on pa-
trol making sure students on bicycles are able 
to see and be seen. 
Starting at 5:30 p.m., they will be checking 
that bicyclists are using headlights and tail-lights as they ride on campus. 
Because the main goal is education, not 
punishment, Capt. Jeff Holcomb said officers 
will not be issuing any citations, just warn-
ings.
He said that when freshmen arrive on cam-
pus at the beginning of the fall semester, they quickly figure out that biking to class is faster 
than walking, but they usually don’t think 
to make sure they have the proper lighting equipment.
The Daylight Savings Time change initi-
ated the light check. 
“Students who used to ride their bikes 
home in the light are now riding them home 
in the dark because of the time change,” he 
said. “This is a perfect time to take advantage of reminding students of the laws that are in effect.”
According to a UPD release, Florida law re-
quires that all bikes be equipped with a white light on the front and a red light on the rear. Reflectors do not meet legal requirements.
UPD is working with the Walmart  Super -
center on Waldo Road to provide a 15 percent discount on light kits to students who bring their written warnings into the store.UPD to help cyclists see light

� SHANDS GETS $9.7 MILLION.

Alligator Contributing Writer
A newly elected legislature overturned 
eight of outgoing Gov. Charlie Crist’s ve-
toes, including a $9.7 million budget ap-propriation for Shands Teaching Hospi-tal, during a special session  Tuesday.The morning started with the swear -
ing in of a super-majority Republican Legislature. 
Republicans currently have a majority 
of 81-39 in the House and 28-12 in the Senate.
Having a super-majority, 
two-thirds of the legislature, 
means Republicans have the ability to overturn vetoes. 
In a speech to the Legislature, Senate President Mike Haridopolos, who is a professor at UF, promised to “spend less” and practice more “slim government.”
In the special session that followed, 
all eight vetoes on the agenda were over -
turned — including millions in spend-ing — and four new pieces of legislation were passed.

Jones leads small anti-

NEW YORK — The Florida pas-

to burn the Quran on Sept. 11 has led a few dozen protesters to the site of a proposed mosque near ground zero.
Terry Jones expressed sympa-

Jones says he doesn’t know 
whether those planning the mosque and Islamic cultural center are radicals. He says he hopes they choose not to build the mosque there, just as he decided not to burn the Islamic holy book.

Stuck in the tough econo-
my , struggling  restaurants in 
Gainesville are forced with two op-tions: close or change to survive. 
Original Pizza Palace on North-
west 13th Street was planning to close, but Tuesday the restaurant reached a deal with its landlord to stay open until at least fall gradua-tion, depending on business. 
The restaurant is planning to 
offer special dishes over the next month in order to attract new cli-ents and stay in business. 
Original Pizza Palace’s owner 
and cook Duane Olsen said the business is not making enough money because they haven’t gen-erated enough excitement at night. 
As a cook, Olsen said he takes 
pride in doing things  the old-fash-ioned way.
“We are not taking a dough ball 
bought at Sam’s and calling our -
selves bakers,” he said.
Olsen has been trying to find 
investors to keep the restaurant open, but he believes that the peo-ple who need to be convinced the most are students. He plans to add lamb, grouper and lobster ravioli to his menu to attract students. 
But while established restau-
rants like Cafe Gardens and the 82-year-old Louis’ Lunch have gone under, other restaurants are expanding in Gainesville.  
 O!O Garden Grille will open 
its doors in the old Cafe Gardens location in midtown next month, 
according to Mike Case, the res-
taurant’s owner. 
This will be the third restaurant 
of Case’s in Gainesville. 
He, too, hopes families in for  
graduation will come in hungry.
Another restaurant opening 
soon is Sarkara Sweets Cafe. It was Yum Cupcakery , at 3345 SW 34th St., but Yum will move downtown to 201 SE Second Ave. 
Sarkara stands for sugar, the 
owner, Stephanie Browning, said. The bakery will open in about a month and a half, she said. Pizza Palace strikes deal with landlord to stay open
� THE STATE HAS 15 MONTHS TO 
CREATE A PLAN.
By MINA RADMAN
Alligator Writer
To the protest of state leaders, the federal 
government has given Florida 15 months to 
create a plan for cleaning its waterways. 
On Monday, the U.S. Environmental Pro-
tection Agency granted Florida the delay to 
meet the new pollution limits set on the state’s rivers, lakes and springs.
The EPA wants the state to reduce the 
levels of phosphorous and nitrogen in many  state waterways. High levels of the nutrients can kill wildlife and make humans sick. 
Environmental engineering professor Jo-
seph Delfino said the EPA took over the pro-cess after the Florida Department of Environ-mental Protection did not clean up the water.
The standards include setting new limits 
for nutrients allowed in the state’s waterways and vary by region. The EPA will also classify lakes into three groups (colored, clear alkaline and clear acidic) and set standards for each. 
The EPA granted the extension in hopes the 
state will make accommodations and to ap-pease political opposition to the standards.
“While we appreciate the delay, Florida 
will continue to fight these heavy-handed Washington, D.C., measures,” state Sen-
ate President Mike Haridopolos said in a statement. “Clearly the Florida-only water standards will cost Floridians jobs, and I will do everything I can to not just delay this un-needed federal intervention, but permanently stop them from taking effect.”
But UF Wetlands and Water Quality Exten-
sion Specialist Mark Clark believes the cost to the state is inevitable — the state can pay mon-etarily now or later in resources.
In Gainesville and Alachua County , several 
waterways are listed as impaired, and efforts are underway to restore these bodies. 
“The longer the state waits to implement 
some kind of nutrient control regulations, the further the water quality deteriorates,” Delfi-
no said.EPA gives Florida ultimatum for cleaning up water“We are not taking 
a dough ball bought 
at Sam’s and calling         
ourselves bakers.”

IssuesEnvironmental THE PROGRAM IS OFFERED TO TEACHERS AT 
HIGH-NEED SCHOOLS IN FIVE COUNTIES.
By BRANDON BRESLOW
Alligator Contributing Writer
When Jocelyn Nerey enrolled at UF in 2008, she didn’t 
pack up a U-Haul, slap a SunPass on her windshield and hit 
the northbound lanes on the turnpike. Instead, she continued working as a prekindergarten special education teacher at Cor -
al Park Elementary School in Miami. 
As a graduate student in the UF Lastinger Center for Learn-
ing’s Florida Master Teacher Initiative, Nerey, 34, takes online courses and meets in her classroom with one or more of the program’s three Miami-based professors-in-residence.
UF offers the tuition-free, on-the-job graduate degree pro-
gram for teachers in high-need schools in five counties: Alach-
ua, Collier, Duval, Pinellas and Miami-Dade, where it started 
in 2006. 
It’s now in 25 Miami-Dade schools, with 88 teachers in pur -
suit of their master’s or, as in Nerey’s case, specialist’s degrees. 
The Lastinger Center is preparing to expand and evaluate 
the program in 25 more Miami-Dade schools through a $6 mil-lion Investing in Innovation grant it recently received from the 
U.S. Department of Education (including a $1 million match 
from the W.K. Kellogg Foundation).
The Lastinger Center was one of only 49 programs to earn the grant. Other winners include the Harvard Graduate School of Education, the Smithsonian Institution’s National Science 
Resources Center and Teach for America.
The grant-funded Lastinger expansion will benefit about 
1,125 teachers and nearly 30,000 students in Miami-Dade.
“This is an exciting chance for us to create and research new 
ways of approaching teacher development, early childhood ed-
ucation, student assessment and a variety of other priorities,” 
said Phil Poekert, a UF Lastinger Center professor-in-residence in Miami.
California-based research institute SRI International will 
receive $950,000 of the grant money to observe and evaluate 
the program’s impact on the grant’s 25 participating schools, 
compared to a control group of 25 randomly selected schools in Miami-Dade. 
“This will be our opportunity to prove whether our project 
works,” Poekert said. “We would like to say with certainty, us-
ing the gold standard of research, that this has a positive effect 
on teachers and their practice, the school culture and the stu-dent learning.”
At Coral Park Elementary, teachers join forces to tackle indi-
vidual and common issues. 
“The program has taught us to build a community within 
our school,” Nerey said. “When I sat down with my colleagues, 
I realized that we all had the same problems and we could work together to attack them.”
In her portable classroom in the back of the school, Nerey 
works year-round to develop a maternal relationship with her 
12 prekindergarten special education students. 
Many of her students struggle to say their own names, use 
the bathroom by themselves or walk, but Nerey aims to help them become as independent as possible. 
“I build on being positive, loving and kind, and I feel that 
will bring out the stuff that they need to learn,” she said. “From a simple thing like potty training to learning how to read, I 
have to find what motivates them.”
It is Nerey’s dedication to helping her students that led her 
to enroll in the Master Teacher program.
Magdalena “Magdi” Castañeda, a UF professor-in-resi-
dence in Miami, has worked with Nerey since she started the program and has witnessed her improvement as a teacher.
“[Nerey] was an exceptional childhood educator with a 
strong foundation in child development to begin with,” Casta-
ñeda said. “But now she’s learning even more because she 
seeks the knowledge and she thrives on it.” 
Nerey hopes to one day become a leader in her school, but 
she has no intention to leave the classroom or her students any-
time soon. 
“I don’t bring these kids down because they have a disabil-
ity ,” she said. “On the contrary , I have to be stronger with them 
because I know they can do it.”4, ALLIGATOR  WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 17, 2010

The holiday season is a time to give 
to those in need, and this year, some of 
Gainesville’s local businesses are offering 
rewards to those who donate.
The Shoppes of Thornebrook and soror -
ities from UF are teaming up to host “Soror -
ity Night” on Thursday from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m.  
Shoppers are asked to bring one non-perishable food item to The Shoppes of Thornebrook, 2441 NW 43rd St.
In return, donors will receive a flier 
with coupons to most of the stores in the shopping center, according to Beverly 
Clapp, owner of The Painted Table, an an-
tique shop in the center.
“We’re just a group of local people who 
wanted to do something to help the com-munity, and this is where we went with it,” Clapp said.
Mai Le, president of Theta Nu Xi Mul-
ticultural Sorority Inc. at UF, is excited to be participating in the event. She and a 
few of her sorority sisters are planning to 
bring nonperishable food items and shop around the center.
“It’s something different,” Le said. “We don’t get contacted every day for some-
thing like this.”
The idea for the food drive actually 
came from something that Florida State 
University did a few years ago at a football game, Clapp said.
“My husband wondered about what 
you could do if every UF student brought just one food item,” Clapp said.
Clapp invited each sorority individu-
ally to take part in the event.
“I think they have a lot to offer and they 
are a very vital part of the community,” Clapp said.
Depending on how much food is col-
lected, some will be donated to Catholic Charities and Peaceful Paths Domestic 
Abuse Network, among others.
“With a lot of people cooperating to-
gether,” Clapp said, “you can accomplish wonderful things.”Sororities, shops team up

Despite a modest decline among stu-
dents nationwide, interest in studying 
abroad has not waned at UF.
A report released Monday by the In-
stitute of International Education found a decline of 0.8 percent in students who 
study abroad. This report marks the first 
time in 25 years that the numbers have not increased.
According to Susanne Hill, executive 
director for the UF International Center, the number of study abroad students at 
the university remains steady.
“We attribute [the lack of increased 
interest] to the fact that we are still not completely out of the economic hole,” 
Hill said. “There is more interest than ever, but families cannot afford it.”
Most students who choose to study 
abroad take short trips, usually in the summer or for a semester. Only four 
percent of students nationwide study 
abroad longer than an academic or calen-dar year.
“It would be fun to go for longer, 
but it’s the most convenient in the sum-
mer,” said freshman Stephanie Zoller, 
who plans to study abroad in London next summer. “I’ll still be able to expe-
rience the culture, but I need to be [in 
Gainesville] during the year.”
UF has seen the effects of the nation-
wide trend of going to lesser known or less popular countries, but not as pre-dominantly as at other universities. 
Students have shown in-
creased interest in studying in China and places where 
they can learn Hebrew or 
Arabic.
However, a majority of UF students 
still choose to study abroad in Western Europe. 
The four top countries to study in are 
the UK, Spain, Italy and France.
“It will always be the most popular 
because this is where students do not 
have to get much out of their comfort 
zone,” Hill said.Study abroad interest steady

LOCAL CRIME
By KATIE EMMETS
Alligator Staff Writer
A couple in their 60s were arrested after booze and 
the phrase “bring it on” sparked a fight with a machete 
and a metal pipe.
Emmett Calvin and Jessie Lane had been dating 
and living with each other for nearly six years, but the 
long relationship turned tumultuous  Monday when 
they got into a verbal fight at about 8 p.m.
They had both been drinking alcohol when the fight 
escalated to violence, according to an Alachua County 
Sheriff’s Office report.
Calvin, 63, cursed at Lane, 62, who then told him to 
“bring it on,” and reached for a machete while Calvin 
picked up a metal pipe.
Although Lane swung the machete at Calvin’s face, 
she said she wasn’t sure if it made contact or not.
Calvin then hit Lane on the right side of her face 
with the pipe, which resulted in a lump the size of a golf ball. He then threw the pipe and walked out of their northwest Gainesville house.
According to the report, ASO officers stopped Cal-
vin on the side of the road, and he told them that Lane had hit him in the face with the flat side of the ma-chete. 
Deputies wrote in the report that Calvin’s face is 
weathered and aged so it was difficult for them to tell if any injuries were caused.
Calvin and Lane were arrested and both  charged 
with second degree felonies for domestic battery.Pair fights with

After losing his bid for lieutenant governor 
on the Alex Sink ticket, Rod Smith wants to 
be the head of the state’s Democratic Party.
Smith prosecuted serial killer Danny Roll-
ing as a state attorney and represented Alach-
ua County as a state senator before running for governor in 2006 and lieutenant governor with Alex Sink this year. 
To run for party chair, Smith would first 
have to be a chairman in the Alachua Demo-cratic Party, according to Jon Reiskind, the Alachua County Democratic Party chairman, 
in a phone interview Tuesday. “We’re going 
to make that possibility available to him,” he said. 
The leadership roles available are the 
county’s state committeeman, state commit-teewoman, vice chair and the chair of the county’s Democratic Executive Committee.
Reiskind stated that they are working on 
the details and should know within a day or two, but joked that, “We could speculate that he’s not going to be the committeewoman.” 
Smith is seen as the front-runner for the 
role after Karen Thurman, the current chair -
woman, announced her resignation Friday. 
While Smith has not officially announced 
his bid for the position, he told The Gainesville Sun on Friday that he is seeking it.Eric Jotkoff, the communications director 
for the state Democratic Party, said Tuesday that Thurman will soon announce the time and place of the election of the next chair.
Sink and Smith lost to Republican Rick 
Scott and his running mate, Jennifer Carroll, by one percentage point earlier this month. 
But in Alachua County, Sink beat Scott 59 
percent to 38 percent. 
Smith’s secretary, Joyce Parish, said he 
was out of the office Tuesday and was un-available for comment.Former Sink running mate hopes to head state Democrats
� HE SAID HE HAD A GUN.
By KAT BEIN
Alligator Staff Writer
Gainesville Police are searching 
for a man who threatened to pull a gun on a pharmacist while demand-
ing drugs at a CVS on Tuesday.At about 1:55 p.m., the man 
walked into the CVS at 3404 SW 
Archer Road and demanded “rox-ies” — a street name for the highly addictive narcotic pain reliever Rox-icodone — from the pharmacist, ac-
cording to the GPD release.
The pharmacist stood and re-
fused to give the suspect any drugs, 
at which point the suspect said, “I have a gun, don’t make me pull it out,” according to the release.
The pharmacist continued to 
say no, and the man left the store on foot without revealing a 
weapon.
Though the CVS worker was not 
injured in this case, police advise 
against taking such a heroic position if approached by someone threaten-ing violence.
“What we tell people is to com-
ply with demands, especially with a threat of violence,” said GPD spokeswoman Tscharna Senn. 
“I wouldn’t want to go so far as

A UF journalism student will be getting some face time with 
Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie at the end of this month.
Gaby Izarra won MTV’s “The Ultimate Tourist Guest Cor -
respondent Contest” and will help promote the movie “The 
Tourist” starring  Jolie and Depp.
The contest began Oct. 7 and ended Nov. 4. Each contestant submitted a one-minute video explaining 
why he or she deserved to be “The Ultimate Tourist Guest Correspondent.”  Izarra said she will be flown to Paris on Nov. 30 to inter -
view the cast and crew of “The Tourist.”
Izarra, who hopes to write about music 
in the future, said she already has experi-ence interviewing celebrities.
“I’ve already had a lot of experience 
with big-name music artists, like MGMT,” Izarra said.
Izarra said she hasn’t thought of any 
questions yet, but she will start to draft some soon. 
She will be given $200 in shopping money and $100 every day of her trip, she said.
She said she will return to the U.S. on Dec. 4. With a passion for electronic music, Izarra said she heard 
about the contest by following one of her favorite music art-ists, Laidback Luke, on Twitter. 
She said she noticed MTV employee Lara Kathleen Kelley 
on Laidback Luke’s Twitter page.
Izarra said she messaged Kelley on Facebook and asked 
her for career advice. 
She said Kelley responded and advised her to enter the 
contest. According to Kelley, more than 100 contestants en-tered. Student to meet celebrities in Paris through MTV contest

Today’s question: Do you care 
if your friends think the person you’re dating is attractive?
71 TOTAL VOTES61% YES39% NOTuesday’s question: Are airport security measures too intrusive?Constant Facebook changes for the better
Listen closely. Do you hear that? It’s the sound of 
five hundred million groans as Facebook tweaks itself again, changing the functionality of its in-
box to become even more social and even less private. 
Correction, make that 499,999,999 groans.
 I’m in favor of Facebook’s changes, as long as there’s 
an opt-out for users who don’t share my enthusiasm. 
Facebook announced this past week it was convert-
ing its messages system into a truly “social inbox.” Each 
Facebook user receives their own e-mail address, user -
name @ facebook.com. 
Messages will now be threaded and organized as in-
teraction between two users, instead of on individual topics and subjects. 
All of a sudden, Facebook’s “View Friendship,” a 
feature that led to confusion and frustration just a week ago, seems to make a lot more sense.
My friends think I’m nuts for supporting nearly all of 
Facebook’s revisions, revamps and changes. 
I believe a constantly evolving product becomes a 
better one. 
I like change, perhaps that burned me this past Elec-
tion Day, but a constantly changing Facebook keeps me on my toes and doesn’t allow me to get comfortable 
with one revision or version of my favorite social net-
working site.
Facebook and the team behind it has genuinely good 
interests. 
No, I didn’t get to see “The Social Network,” but I 
can sure guess at its overall intent. And that rendition of Radiohead’s “Creep” by Scala and Kolacny Brothers still haunts me every time I log in to Facebook. 
Perhaps I’m naive, but I don’t think the man behind the curtain at Facebook is trying to steal my identity.
It’d be incredibly naive to say 
Facebook was never a major vio-lator of privacy. Recent decisions, like Facebook’s social integration with Pandora and Yelp, fire up red 
flags.
 I don’t think there’s a Dr. Evil 
at Facebook sitting in a big chair in a big room with 
millions of TV screens cackling sinisterly at these new features. I truly believe Facebook’s chief intention is to 
make the experience better for all its users, and I’ll be-
lieve that as long as an opt-out feature is always add-ed.
One of Facebook’s greatest moves in the past year 
was the centralization and organization of privacy set-tings. 
It wasn’t a pretty change, like the creation of a “social 
inbox” or the new groups system, but it took potentially one of Facebook’s most important settings — especially 
for underage college students who are often pictured 
with red cups, six packs or beer bongs — and made it easier to understand for most of the five hundred mil-lion people who are using the social network.
Facebook continues to evolve and change for the 
better, and this is most evident with the recent institu-tion of its new social inbox. Right on, Mark Zuckerberg. Keep up the good work, Facebook, but make sure you’re letting users who want to keep their identities private 
have the ability to do so.

House right to ban 
disturbing videos
Mice, hamsters and other small woodland creatures, re-
joice! The lame-duck House of Representatives thinks you’re the most important demographic. 
The House of Representatives, on its first vote on its day 
back in session after the midterm election, agreed to put a ban 
on crush videos — an underground, demented and borderline 
pathologically deviant form of video that depicts women often wearing high heels crushing small animals to death for a twist-ed sexual fetish.
The U.S. Supreme Court in April struck down a previous law 
that banned the sale of crush videos because of First Amend-ment violations.
And to check the justices at the door and give those stomped-
on ferrets a voice, the House of Representatives wrote and 
passed a more narrowly defined piece of legislation. 
While many Americans were hoping Congress  would tackle 
other issues in the first day of the lame-duck session, including 
ending “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” for good, the House’s decision to revisit the issue of prohibiting the sale and distribution of crush videos in the wake of a Supreme Court decision provides enormous precedent and a fine example of the beauty of checks and balances. 
While the Editorial Board might be a bit partial in our un-
abashed adoration for gerbils and other small rodents, we re-alize the First Amendment is intended to protect free speech, which includes the most distasteful and disagreeable vitriol. It does not protect speech that results in physical harm. With the Supreme Court’s striking down on such a ban, thereby making it permissible to produce and distribute these vile videos, it set a precedent for far more disturbing videos to be distributed in the name of free speech. Guinea pigs and Americans across this great land send many thanks to Congress today.
We’re so vain
No longer will date-less debutantes have to rely on their lying 
friends for an honest opinion on how hot their dates are. 
No, thanks to the website 
Candobetter.com, you’ll nev-er have to rely on that whole ridiculous inner beauty thing because now cyberspace will know for sure just how hot or not your date is. 
Candobetter.com markets 
itself as a fusion between so-
cial networking and NewAge 
dating, which is really just a big, fancy euphemism for Fa-cebook stalking for online dat-ing fanatics. 
The website allows those 
unsure of how attractive their dates really are to post a pic-ture from their dates’ Face-
book or other online profiles 
to the dating website for oth-ers to judge.  Never mind the grossly superficial elements of the website’s very basic foun-dation, or the weirdest thing to happen to social media since Facebook started show-ing us “photo memories” of memories we don’t have. 
And although we at the 
Editorial Board have had our questions about some of the people we’ve chosen to date, we didn’t rely on an extra-creepy website and strang-ers to tell us if we should or should not date someone based solely upon their attrac-tiveness level.
But perhaps the most dis-
turbing, or the most accurate, fact about the new website was from its creator, who said, “People on first dates are not looking for meaningful conversations.”
And in the biggest devel-
opment in sexual selection 
since Darwin, Candobetter.
com finally allows online daters the infinite capacity to judge. 
We hope you’re better than 
this, Gators.

Florida fans among the best
I take offense to comments people have 
made about UF having “the worst fans on 
the planet.” 
Florida football consistently has among 
the highest attendance numbers every year.
 The boos are a sign of frustration after 
putting our hearts and souls into these teams 
year after year. 
Terrible fans don’t bother showing up if 
they know their team is going to  struggle. 
We are not “bandwagon” fans, either, 
as some other self-righteous observers may say. 
Fans continued to support a young, four-
loss team in 2007 even though the produc-tion on one half of the ball was clearly lack-
ing.
 We know what this team is capable 
of, which makes it all the more painful to watch. 
Booing or leaving early is a die-hard fan’s 
way of letting the coaching staff know some -
thing has to change. Hopefully the team can salvage what’s left of the season before apa-thy sets in.

Israeli innovation should be appreciated
I agree with Micah Lukowitz’s Monday letter. A strong alliance with Israel is abso-
lutely essential to promoting democracy in 
the Middle East. 
Israel stands as a symbol that proves how 
a struggling democratic people, surrounded by enemies on every border, can still suc-
ceed and flourish. 
Lukowitz brings up many strong points 
about the importance of the solid bond be-
tween America and Israel, our sole demo-
cratic ally in the region. 
As an engineer, Israel means more to me 
than just politics.
Israel is one of the world’s leading inno-
vators of the technologies we take for grant-ed in America and in countries around the globe. 
Israeli scientists are world leaders in med-
icine, bio-technology and alternative and re-
newable energy. Israeli engineers were the first to develop text messaging technology. 
Israeli scientific influence can be seen 
even here on campus, as the new water-sav-ing flush toilets being installed at Southwest Rec Center are inspired by Israeli design.
It’s clear how Israel is important to 
American interests on so many levels. From politics, to human rights, to the cell phone in your pocket, Israel’s significance is undeni-able.

Unless you live under a rock and don’t use Facebook or read this newspaper, you’ve heard about plans to bring a block tuition program to UF. UF Presi-
dent Bernie Machen is eager to implement block tuition as soon as possible, but his administration’s proposal is unsuitable for this campus. 
However, if UF’s Board of Trustees decides to approve 
his proposal at its Dec. 9 meeting, block tuition would be on 
the fast track to adoption by next fall. We all still have the opportunity to take action against block tuition, but we’re running out of time.
In case you’re fuzzy on details, here’s a recap: The ad-
ministration is proposing a flat-rate tuition program that 
would charge full-time undergraduates for 15 credits in the fall and spring semesters regardless of the amount of credits they actually take (between 12 and 18). 
Undergraduate students currently take an average of 
14.1 credits per semester, so every undergraduate would be paying 6 percent more tuition on average under this program. 
Right now, you might be thinking: “Just a 6 percent 
increase? What’s the big deal?” 
For most of us, a 6 percent increase doesn’t seem like 
enough of a reason for us to channel our inner Howard Beale and tell President Machen and Student Government that we’re mad as hell and we’re not gonna take it any-more.
I mean, it’s only 6 percent, right? And we’ll be allowed 
to take more credits than we pay for? Why should we care so much?
Here’s why.For starters, consider how even a relatively small 6 per -
cent increase could be huge to a student who has maxed out their available financial aid but still needs to work just to pay the bills. 
According to recent university data, one out of every 
10 undergraduates — 3,000 students — are working 20 or more hours per week in addition to the time they spend on their academ-ics, and about one-third of all 30,000 
undergrads are spending at least an 
hour a day at a part-time job.
The administration has publicly stated that the goal 
of this program is to “encourage” students to graduate sooner, and that they plan to use the additional revenue 
collected from block tuition to pay for more professors and TAs if demand for courses increases. To them, this program isn’t about the money. 
But to financially disadvantaged students, it’s 100 per -
cent about the money.
To us all, it’s about the unjust treatment of fellow stu-
dents.
 If you’re juggling course loads with workloads and 
are just trying to make ends meet so you can afford to graduate in a reasonable amount of time, but your univer -
sity’s big-wigs have decided to charge you more for your education because they believe you have too much free time on your hands, they either have ignored your situa-tion, or they have discriminated against you, willingly or 
otherwise. 
In any case, they’re wrong.
As a financially disadvantaged student of a taxpayer-
subsidized university, you deserve a fair shake.
Also affected are students enrolled in degree programs 
that recommend reduced course loads in the fall and spring semesters. 
The College of Engineering, the second largest college 
at UF, in particular offers many degrees that suggest tak-
ing 12-14 credits in fall and spring and a few credits in 
the summer, so that students aren’t overwhelmed by an exceptionally difficult curriculum. 
Being an engineering major, I am more familiar with 
the degrees offered by my college, but I doubt that engi-neers are the only group in exceptionally difficult degree programs.
If block tuition passes, some of us, in an attempt to 
minimize our tuition cost, will choose (arguably) unwise-ly to go against our college’s recommendations and will overload our fall and spring course schedules, rather than distribute a few of those courses over a summer semes-
ter. 
The rest of us will follow our college’s recommenda-
tions but end up paying significantly more for our de-
grees, because our average annual tuition cost will rise as we continue to take an average 30-credit-hour annual 
course load.
Why should engineers and other students in difficult 
degree programs be punished for the careers they’ve cho-
sen?
Aside from the financial implications of block tuition, 
UF already plans to increase tuition by 15 percent annu-ally until it reaches the national average. 
Any additional tuition hike from a block tuition pro-
gram will exaggerate the discriminatory effects that tu-ition increases have on the neediest of students among 
us.
The university administration has failed to address 
these serious concerns, and Student Body President Ash-
ton Charles, who is the student member of the Board of Trustees and is supposed to act as the voice of the Student 
Body, has refused to state an opinion on any aspect of 
their proposal. 
It is time that we, as students, demand that Student 
Government publicly and vocally represents our best in-
terests in this matter of university policy, and that the UF 
administration reconsiders and/or modifies its proposal so it is in line with the financial and academic realities of all UF undergraduates.

DALLAS (AP) — Former 
Vice President Dick Cheney , 
looking noticeably thinner after heart surgery over the summer, told former President George W. Bush he believes time is shed-ding new light on decisions Bush made while in office.
“Two years after your tour in 
the White House ended, judg-ments are a little more measured than they were,” said Cheney , who introduced his former boss during a groundbreaking for Bush’s presidential center in Dal-las. “When the times have been tough and critics have been loud, you’ve always said you’ve had faith in history’s judgment. And history is beginning to come around.”
Cheney was one of more than 3,000 friends, supporters and 
former administration officials 
attending the groundbreaking. Outside, about 100 protesters were joined by a handful of coun-ter-protesters.
The center, which will house 
both a library and a policy institute, is ex-pected to open in February 
2013.
Bush also 
was joined by former Secre-
tary of State Condoleezza Rice as shovels were pressed into the earth to commemorate the groundbreaking for the George W. Bush Presidential Center.
“It is hard to believe there 
is this much excitement about shoveling dirt,” quipped Bush.Bush breaks ground

Veto would have meant drastic cuts
expect to get about $15 million this year with 
matching federal funds included. 
The funds pay for some medical residencies 
and the cost of treating the uninsured and the poor from around the state, said Belita More-ton, director of government relations for Shands HealthCare.
According to Moreton, had the veto not  been 
overridden, the hospital would have had to make drastic budget cuts, admit fewer underfunded Medicaid and charity patients, and eliminate several medical residencies, psychiatric units and bed burn units.
For the past 30 years, the funds had always 
been approved annually for Shands, until being 
vetoed for the first time by Crist in the summer, saying the hospital shouldn’t receive special treatment.
“That particular veto was kind 
of inexplicable. Nobody saw it coming,” said po-litical science professor Kenneth D. Wald. “No-body understands why he did it.”LEGISLATURE , from page 1The debate is over 1 percent of budget

The commissioner suggested that instead of 
granting additional funding, the sheriff could trans-fer money from overpaid parts of her budget, such 
as patrol, and move it to the areas she’s concerned 
about.
Byerly said that the Commission does not control 
how agencies spend their money , but he is concerned that if it gives her extra funds, they may have to con-sider micromanaging agencies’ budgets.
He said the Commission has enough money for 
the request, but it has already determined the ap-proved budget was the right amount.
“Sometimes you do what’s right and you stick to 
your legal guns,” he said.
Commissioner Rodney Long said that the debate 
is about 1 percent of the budget, and the Sheriff’s Of-fice will not be in financial straits while the debate is settled.
“The county government is not going to shut 
down because we have a discrepancy,” he said.
Commissioner Paula DeLaney said that she 
would like to speak with Darnell one-on-one before she decides anything, but for now she agrees with 
Byerly that the commission should not change the 
budget. 
The appeal will be discussed at the next Commis-
sion meeting on Tuesday and the Sheriff’s Office will present its arguments on Dec. 7.SHERIFF , from page 1� THERE WAS AN $1,800

JACKSON, Miss. — A federal 
lawsuit claims guards at a Missis-
sippi juvenile lockup have smug-gled drugs to inmates, had sex with some of them and denied others 
medical treatment and basic educa-
tional services.
The Southern Poverty Law Cen-
ter, the American Civil Liberties Union and Rob McDuff, a Jackson attorney, filed the complaint Tues-day in U.S. District Court in Jackson on behalf of 13 plaintiffs against the Walnut Grove Youth Correctional 
Facility. The Justice Department 
also is investigating.
“These young men live in bar -
baric conditions,” said Sheila Bedi, the law center’s deputy legal direc-tor. “I have done prisons conditions work for almost 10 years, this is the most violent, corrupt abusive pris-on I’ve come across.”
The complaint claims that 
guards allowed inmate fights that resulted in stab wounds and severe beatings, including one that left one youth with permanent brain damage. It also says inmates were stripped naked and held in isola-tion for weeks at a time and that sick inmates were denied proper 
health care.
Sex acts between inmates and 
prison guards and nurses occurred 
in isolated, camera-free areas of the prison, including individual cells, medical unit examination rooms 
and restrooms, the lawsuit alleges.
It also claimed handcuffed 
youth were kicked and punched by guards, while others secured in 
their cells were sprayed with chem-
ical restraints.
The lawsuit names as defen-
dants the Walnut Grove Correc-tional Authority, which is overseen 
by the town of Walnut Grove; the 
GEO Group, Inc., which is paid to 
run the prison; Health Assurance, LLC; warden Walter Tripp; Mis-sissippi Department of Corrections Commissioner Chris Epps and Mis-
sissippi Education Superintendent 
Tom Burnham.
The lawsuit seeks class action 
status.
GEO Group, based in Boca Ra-
ton, Fla., and agency officials de-clined to comment on the lawsuit Tuesday.
Michael McIntosh said his son, 
Michael Jr., was beaten so badly earlier this year he sustained brain damage from which he’ll never re-cover. McIntosh, of Hazlehurst, was at the news conference announcing the lawsuit. He wouldn’t disclose the crime that led to his 21-year-old son’s incarceration.
“After my son was attacked, no 
one would tell me where he was or what happened for two weeks,” said McIntosh.
When he visited his son in a hos-
pital about a month after the attack, he said his son “was so severely beaten, he couldn’t see me.”
The Justice Department last 
month sent a letter to Gov. Haley 
Barbour, urging the state to coop-
erate with the investigation, which would determine whether there are systemic constitutional violations at Walnut Grove. House Juvenile Justice Committee Chairman Earle Banks, D-Jackson, provided the let-ter from Thomas E. Perez, an assis-tant attorney general.WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 17, 2010 � ALLIGATOR, 9

� THE WOMAN DIED AT 95 IN 1992.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
LOS ANGELES — It was a mystery that 
could have been ripped right from the 
pages of a Raymond Chandler novel.
Someone carefully wrapped the mum-
mified remains of two babies — a boy and 
a girl — in newspapers, placed each one 
in an old-fashioned doctor satchel, then locked them in a steamer trunk in the base-ment of a Los Angeles apartment building, where they remained for three-quarters of a century.
After months of sleuthing, police and 
coroner’s officials solved at least part of the mystery this week when they con-
firmed the babies’ mother was a Scottish 
woman named Janet M. Barrie who died in Canada in 1992 at the age of 95.But questions remained about the iden-
tity of their father, why the babies were 
placed in the trunk, and why their mother 
kept it for decades, only to leave it behind when she moved to Canada.
Anybody who might have had the 
answers likely took the details to their grave.
“The entire story will probably never 
be known,” police investigators said in a terse statement Monday noting DNA anal-
ysis confirmed Barrie was the mother of 
the children.
Police also said they had closed the case 
after concluding there was no evidence the children were murdered.
Veteran coroner’s investigator Joyce 
Kato said piecing together Barrie’s sketchy life story was one of her most fascinating and complicated pursuits.
The work began last August when two 
women cleaning the basement of the apart-ment building near downtown found the long-discarded trunk and what initially 
appeared to be its treasure trove of 1930s-
era memorabilia.
There were books, antiques, an iron, 
girdle, nurse’s uniform, letters and post-cards — and the bodies of the two babies.
“We went through every single piece,” 
said Kato, adding some of the items led them on wild goose chases to addresses 
they found for people in 
San Francisco and South 
Africa.
Outsiders, meanwhile, 
speculated that Barrie might have been related to “Peter Pan” author J.M. Barrie, something that was quickly disproved.
Through census and immigration re-
cords, investigators found Barrie had been born in Scotland in 1897, moved to Canada 
with her family as a child and eventually 
settled in the United States. She was living in Los Angeles during 
the 1930 census.
At some point, she briefly moved back 
to her Canadian hometown of Diamond City, Alberta, returning to the United States in 1941 and telling immigration of-ficials in Detroit her sponsor was a dentist friend named Dr. George Knapp.
It turned out that Barrie, a nurse, 
worked for years caring for Knapp’s ailing wife, Mary. At one point he bought three 
apartments in the Los Angeles building, 
converted two of them into a single dwell-ing for himself and his wife and put Barrie up in the other one.
After his wife died in 1964, Knapp, then 
86, married the 67-year-old Barrie. He died four years later.
Barrie’s niece, Marlene Brown of Alber -
ta, Canada, provided authorities the DNA 
sample used to determine Barrie was the 
mother of the babies in the trunk. DNA shows nurse was mom of mummified infants in LA

“This team is going to go down as 
one of my all-time favorites in the 16 years I’ve been here, and that’s 
because they love playing soccer. 
I know that sounds unusual, but they just loved it. They worked hard, they were focused and it 
was a joy to coach them every 
day.”
Burleigh said she has no re-
grets with this team, which makes its early exit from the NCAA 
Tournament that much harder. 
She said this team had chemistry, heart and talent, “the total pack-age to make a deep run.”
Florida was a top-10 team for 
most of the season and seemed to be hitting its stride heading into the NCAAs. 
The Gators dominated the 
Southeastern Conference, win-ning a fifth straight regular-sea-son title while claiming their first tournament title since 2007. 
Burleigh’s team was markedly 
improved over last season after a tough offseason that emphasized stronger team defense. 
Florida’s team possessed a 
vaunted attack that saw five play-ers score a combined 44 goals.  The Gators had a goal differential of plus-40 this season, substantially 
up from last season’s plus-27.
And yet the season came down 
to who shot the ball the best from 
12 yards away. 
“We’re extremely disappoint-
ed,” forward Lindsay Thompson said. “We all believed that we were going to make it really far. We knew we were a special team and we’re not happy it’s over.”
“I know we had more to give,” 
Tymrak said. “But we can’t be mad at ourselves. We set several goals and achieved them, but we 
just have to keep improving.”
Burleigh made it a point that 
one loss doesn’t wipe away what 
the Gators accomplished this sea-
son.
“I am really proud of this team 
for what they accomplished up 
until this point, and we’re not go-ing to let one game like this define 
what this group was,” she said. 
“The most disappointing part is to have such a talented team out this early. That is something that 
is going to weigh on us, I’m sure, 
but it doesn’t take away from the individuals that were a part of this group.” 
Although the Gators are 
shocked their season is over, the 
development of several core play-
ers provides hope for the future.
Kat Williamson stepped right 
into the vacated shoes of All-American Lauren Hyde and pro-
ceeded to win the SEC Defensive 
Player of the Year. 
McKenzie Barney came on 
strong late last season, and this 
season she led the conference in 
goals while captaining the Gators as their vocal and inspirational leader.
Tahnai Annis, right behind Barney with 13 goals, and Thomp-son, who chipped in 8, will both return next season. Tymrak was the sparkplug to Florida’s attack with her SEC-leading 13 assists, 
and she, too, will be back next 
season. 
The Gators return several in-
dispensable underclassmen, in-
cluding SEC Freshman of the Year 
Taylor Travis and steady-holding midfielder Caroline Triglia. Seniors Katie Fraine, Ashlee 
Elliott and Nicky Kit will be sore-ly missed, but their departures do not leave any glaring holes. 
Goalie Brooke Chancey proved 
in the conference tournament her ability to step up, while defender Jo Dragotta came on strong late in the season.
The sour taste will stay for 
quite some time, but the Gators are motivated to make sure they don’t have to experience that feel-ing again.
“Next year we’re going to 
have it in the back of our minds,” Thompson said. “We’re going to 
do everything in our power to 
not let it happen again for a third year in a row where we go out in the round of 32. We’re a better 
team than that. Everybody knows 
we’re a better team than that. We just have to do it.”14, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 17, 2010

UF wildcat quarterback Trey Burton took just one carry against South Carolina. The freshman averaged about six 
carries per game heading into Saturday’s loss. 
Addazio expects to be back as UF’s offensive coordinator next season
involved because there weren’t enough plays to go around 
early in the game. 
Addazio admitted that once Florida started to get down, 
they went to more passing plays with John Brantley than usu-al. 
“We had a great two weeks going into this last game. We 
had a great plan, we had a great two weeks, everybody felt 
good from the players to the coaches about it,” Addazio said. 
“That’s what’s most disappointing, that we couldn’t get our plan going that we felt so great about.”
Burton ran the ball one time after carrying it 17 times for 
110 yards two weeks prior against Georgia, and Reed ran it 
eight times after rushing 16 times for 84 yards against Van-
derbilt on Nov. 6. The two combined for nine carries against South Carolina.
“Probably a mistake,” Meyer said of getting away from 
the two running quarterbacks. “We felt a little panicked when things weren’t going well. We felt panicked and we re-ally shouldn’t have because it was only 15-7 [at halftime]. I’m one of those guys that gets panicky. I have to learn to shut my mouth sometimes and say, ‘Look, we have a plan,’ and go 
with the plan.”
Addazio secure for next year: Steve Addazio was asked 
point blank if he feels his job as UF’s offensive coordinator will 
be safe for next season.
“Yeah absolutely, I think coach (Meyer) addressed that, 
didn’t he?” Addazio said. 
Meyer said he didn’t think there was a chance Addazio 
would not be back next season, and Addazio added that he “absolutely” wants to be at Florida doing the same job next 
year.FOOTBALL , from page 16

On Sunday, Florida celebrated senior 
day and the careers of middle blocker 
Lauren Bledsoe, libero Erin Fleming 
and outside hitter Callie Rivers in the O’Connell Center.
After the No. 1 Gators (24-1, 17-0 
Southeastern Conference) defeated Ala-
bama in straight sets, 3-0 (25-17, 25-10, 
25-17), it already looked like a picture-perfect day for the UF seniors. Bledsoe hit .667 with nine kills and four blocks, Fleming had nine digs, four assists and a service ace while Rivers hit .333 with nine 
kills and six digs.
However, the day got even better later 
in the afternoon after Kentucky upset No. 
15 LSU 3-2 (25-23, 21-25, 25-23, 18-25, 15-
11). The LSU loss guaranteed the Gators 
at least a share of the SEC title.
“Amanda [Brooks] texted me a little 
after our game on Sunday,” Bledsoe said. “It was really cool to hear that. Who 
wouldn’t be excited for that?”After receiving the news from the Uni-
versity Athletic Association communica-
tions intern, Bledsoe and the rest of the 
Gators were happy to know that they had 
once again put Florida atop the SEC.
Florida won an SEC title each year 
from 1991 to 2008. 
But 2009 was the first season that the 
Gators failed to win a conference cham-pionship under coach Mary Wise after ty-ing for third place.
“Last year is behind us but this year’s 
team has a chance to do what last year’s team couldn’t,” Bledsoe said.
A win against Arkansas on Friday will 
give Florida sole possession of the title. 
The Gators now have 19 SEC champion-
ships — the most in conference history.
Even with the NCAA Tournament 
right around the corner, the Gators know there is still work to be done before the 
regular season ends.
“It’s easy to get caught up all in the 
tournament and everything, but we still 
have three more matches in the SEC and 
honestly, anything can happen,” Bledsoe 
said. 
“We have goals just in the SEC, so we 
need to get those accomplished and focus one match at a time, and then look to the 
tournament. Sometimes teams get too 
caught up in that too far ahead of the time and that’s detrimental.”
As a senior leader on the team, Bled-
soe wants to make certain the Gators are the only team receiving an SEC title tro-phy this season.
“I’m convincing them to not look too 
far ahead even though it’s really tempt-
ing,” Bledsoe said. “If you talk to them 
it can help keep everyone focused. Our team isn’t too hard to handle.”
Florida could have very well played 
its last match in Gainesville on Sunday. Depending on whether Florida hosts any postseason matches, the Gators road to the national championship could begin now. 
Although Wise considers the tour -
nament to have a much different atmo-sphere than regular-season matches.
“When you get to the NCAA Tourna-
ment, it’s a very distinct, different feel-ing,” Wise said. “Obviously, we are play-ing for a lot and we have a lot at stake and the challenges of playing on the road are similar, but the NCAA Tournament does 
have a different look.”WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 17, 2010 � ALLIGATOR, 15

Senior Lauren Bledsoe (17) and the Gators can gain sole possession of the SEC title 
with a win against Arkansas on Friday.
Look no further than Patric 
Young for an indication of how Gators fans should feel 
after Ohio State smacked Florida 93-75 in the O’Dome on Tuesday night.
UF’s super-talented, highly re-
cruited five-star freshman turned in an uninspired two points and two rebounds against the Buck-
eyes, which is nothing to feel ac-
complished about.
But Gators fans should take 
solace in the fact that at least they have a Patric Young, a physical big man who can come off the 
bench, rebound and give a defen-sive presence once he develops. 
Young, like the Gators as a 
whole, is nowhere close to what he could or should be yet. But 
here’s why Gators fans should feel encouraged after watching their team get blown out by the No.4 team in the country: Flori-da’s flaws are fixable. 
Since the ‘04s left in 2007, UF’s 
biggest problem has been some-thing that you can’t change in the 
middle of a season — a lack of tal-
ent. 
Coach Billy Donovan hasn’t 
had the players to make a deep 
NCAA Tournament run since Joa-kim Noah 
and Co. left Gainesville. 
Until now. 
The way 
Florida lost 
bodes much better for the fate of its season 
than if the 
Buckeyes had squeezed out a 68-65 win with both teams shooting 
relatively poor.
UF and OSU both shot over 60 
percent from the field and 40 per -
cent from three. And in the end, it was the 
Gators’ inability to keep the Buck-eyes from getting easy buckets 
when they broke the Gators’ press 
or got penetration from their wing players, coupled with turnovers, that did them in. 
Is that fun to watch happen to 
your team as a fan? No. 
But it’s a helluva lot better than 
knowing that no matter what your team does, it doesn’t have the 
talent to compete, a feeling that 
many Gators fans have rightfully had over the last three seasons.
This team has the talent.
The defense and press will get better. 
Florida was a great defensive 
team a season ago and only got deeper and more athletic.
More importantly, these play-
ers want to play defense and 
understand that’s what will win them games.
Maybe it was hard to imagine 
while watching Young play Tues-
day, but the freshman has a chance 
to mature into a great player. Just 
like Florida has a chance to ma-
ture into a great team. 
And that’s a chance Gators fans 
should feel great about, even after 
a blowout loss at home.
Home loss disappointing, but shows Florida has talent to make run

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
ORLANDO — Power-hitting sec-
ond baseman Dan Uggla was dealt 
from the Florida Marlins to the At-lanta Braves on Tuesday for infielder Omar Infante and left-hander Mike 
Dunn in the first trade of the general 
managers’ meetings.
A two-time All-Star, Uggla hit 
.287 with 33 homers and 105 RBIs last season and had been discussing a possible contract extension with Florida. 
He made $7.8 million this year, is 
eligible for salary arbitration and can 
become a free agent after the 2011 
World Series.
Infante was a first-time All-Star 
who hit a career-high .321 with eight 
homers and 47 RBIs. Dunn was 2-0 with a 1.89 ERA in 25 games in his rookie sea-
son.
The trade reunites Uggla with 
former Marlins manager Fredi Gon-
zalez, hired by the Braves to succeed Bobby Cox following the longtime Atlanta manager’s retirement.
Martin Prado split time between 
second and third this year for the Braves, and the trade could be a sign Atlanta is unsure whether third baseman Chipper Jones can return next year from surgery to repair a torn ligament in his left knee. Jones turns 39 in April.
Florida also was close an agree-
ment with free-agent catcher John Buck on an $18 million, three-year contract, a person familiar with the 
negotiations told The Associated 
Press. The person spoke on condi-tion of anonymity because the deal was not yet final. The person said the sides were working to wrap it up.
Buck was a first-time All-Star this 
year, when he hit .281 with 20 hom-ers and 66 RBIs for the Toronto Blue Jays.Marlins

The Gators stepped on the court in 
the second half poised to score a signa-
ture early-season win. 
Twenty minutes later, they walked 
away with doubts lingering about whether they could compete with the nation’s elite. 
Having outscored No. 4 Ohio State 
41-38 in the first half, No. 9 Florida was dominated after the intermission en route to a 93-75 defeat Tuesday in the O’Connell Center. 
The Gators (1-1) led 57-56 with 
12:29 to go, but the Buckeyes closed the game on a 37-18 run by breaking UF’s press and generating a plethora of open looks. 
Ohio State capitalized on those op-
portunities, shooting 70.6 percent in the second half and 62.9 percent for the game in what Ohio State coach Thad Matta called an “ungodly” shooting 
performance. 
The Gators nearly matched the Buck-
eyes’ shooting with a 61.2-percent effort. 
But they were unable to overcome 18 turnovers, which Ohio State (2-0) turned into a 13-shot advantage. 
“Both teams were not very good de-
fensively,” coach Billy Donovan said. “They’re not pressing and we turned it 
over 18 times. Our discipline and our 
decision making has got to get way, way better.”
Florida dominated the interior in the 
first half, scoring 24 points in the paint and taking a 19-8 rebounding edge into the break. 
But Ohio State came out with new 
life and added physicality in the second 
half, outrebounding UF 12-9 and scor -
ing 26 points in the paint. 
“They just came out hungrier,” soph-
omore Erik Murphy said. “They came 
out more physical than they were in the first half.”
Part of OSU’s interior success was 
due to the struggles of UF’s press, which forced just eight turnovers in the game. 
Buckeyes point guards Aaron Craft 
and William Buford were unfazed by the Gators’ aggressive defense, combin-ing for 13 assists and just four turnovers in the contest. 
Their effort also led to a bunch of 
easy baskets for Ohio State, which was able to capitalize on its numbers advan-tage once it thwarted Florida’s initial de-fensive effort. 
“A lot of times it was 2-on-1 with the 
big in the back and we had to make a decision,” Murphy said. “Whatever de-cision we made, the other option was open.”
Ohio State’s primary presence in the 
post was freshman Jared Sullinger, who 
scored 26 points on 13 of 17 shooting 
and also grabbed 10 rebounds. 
Even when the Gators were able to 
record a block, Sullinger was often there to grab his own rebound and score the put-back.
“He’s a great player,” center V ernon 
Macklin said. “He’s wide and it’s tough for me and it’s tough for my guys around me because they have to try to help me, and they also have to guard shooters.”
With Sullinger drawing attention 
inside, the Buckeyes saw a number of open looks from behind the arc, where they shot 9 of 21. 
Many of those chances came after 
OSU broke the press and then used its numbers advantage to find the open shooter. 
“Once they got past the front line 
they were knocking down shots because we weren’t rotating well enough,” for -
ward Chandler Parsons said. 
Kenny Boynton led the Gators in 
scoring, as he recorded 21 points on 
8-of-14 shooting, including 5 of 8 from 
beyond the arc. That effort made him the game’s third leading scorer behind Sullinger and OSU senior David Lighty , who had 26 points on 9 of 11 shooting.

On Monday, Urban Meyer said he panicked 
and got away from the offensive game plan in a 
36-14 loss to South Carolina on Saturday. 
Offensive coordinator Steve Addazio said the 
Gators were simply never able to get into the plan 
because they couldn’t pick up any first downs and 
sustain drives against the Gamecocks. 
UF went three-and-out on four 
of its first six possessions and 
picked up just three first downs in the first three quarters of the game. 
As a result, the amount of possible 
play calls were limited.
“You’ve got to get in a rhythm, you’ve got to get 
going,” Addazio said. “You’ve got to have enough 
plays to be able to rotate guys.”

normal morning. 
But as she finished packing her bag, the real-

tice, no more games, no more 
chances to dance around op-
posing defenders.
Not until next season.For Tymrak and her team-
mates, Sunday’s penalty shoo-
tout defeat in the second round 
of the NCAA Tournament was a devastating loss that rattled 
their stomachs and rained tears down their faces. 
While Duke was a valiant opponent, the 
Gators expected their “special group” to achieve more.
