UF’s Student Senate meeting start-
ed Tuesday night with 66 senators 
present but ended with 47.
Debate grew heated when sena-
tors argued about when campaign-ing for Student Government elections should take place and what the rules should be. 
The debate was cut short by Sen. 
Andy Schein.
Several Students Party senators 
left the room in response.
Right before exiting, Minority Par-
ty Leader Max Stein said, “I doubt the presence of quorum.”
Stein said the Senate did not reach 
quorum under the UF Constitution, which states quorum has to be a ma-jority of the members of the Senate.
However, during the summer, a 
majority of the active members of the Senate must be present, according to Rules and Procedures.
When these requirements are 
ﬁ  lled, quorum is established, and bills can go to a vote.
Senate President Aundre Price 
said there are 86 active members in the Senate, and 44 must be present to vote. 
The bill modifying election cam-
paign rules passed unanimously.
After the meeting, Stein said the 
students were not being represented well.
“I felt the Senate was not acting in 
the best interest of the students,” he said.
Stein said Students Party leaders 
will be bringing the issue to the UF Supreme Court.
This was the ﬁ  nal vote on the elec-
tion campaigning revisions, which proposed to redeﬁ  ne  campaigning to encompass election-speciﬁ  c material that solicits support for a candidate. Campaigning would start one week before elections and end when the polls close.
The revisions added campaign ac-
tivities, which intentionally supports a party or candidate but does not so-Senate ﬁ  nalizes new

Police have arrested an Alachua County man for fatally 
shooting his ex-girlfriend’s father, who didn’t approve of their 
relationship.   
Willard Merle Newman, 19, of 18001 NE 135th Ave. in Wal-
do, has been charged with ﬁ  rst-degree murder for shooting Ronald Andrews, 46, to death in Andrews’ home on Tuesday . He was also charged for armed burglary.
Andrews’ 15-year-old daughter told police she and New-
man had dated for the past four years. Ronald Andrews was strongly opposed to the relationship, and the girl said he 
threatened Newman with violence but never followed through.
The couple broke up two weeks ago, and 
on Monday , Newman requested the girl 
return a silver ring he had given her. Ac-cording to Newman’s arrest report, the girl agreed to return it, but said she would make arrangements to do so later.
Police gave this account: Andrews and 
his brother, Joseph, arrived at Ronald An-
drews’ home at 18104 NE 143rd Ave. in Waldo at about 4:50 p.m. Tuesday after ﬁ  nishing a job as ﬂ  ooring contractors for the day.
Joseph Andrews stayed in the kitchen while Ronald An-
drews went to see if his daughter was home.
According to the arrest report, when Ronald Andrews 
opened his daughter’s bedroom door, Joseph Andrews saw him throw up his hands, surprised, and yell, “What the hell! What the hell!”
He then saw two muzzle ﬂ  ashes, heard two gunshots and 
saw his brother’s body fall forward onto the ﬂ  oor.Man arrested, charged with shooting ex-girlfriend’s father

Although it dampened some 
students’ Memorial Day weekend 
plans, Tropical Storm Beryl deliv-ered much-needed rain to North Florida and helped combat a series of wildﬁ  res.
Six to seven inches of rain fell, 
said Ludie Bond, spokeswoman for the Florida Forest Service.
“We’re very glad it showed up when it did,” she said.
Before the storm, ﬁ  reﬁ  ghters 
were battling 25 ﬁ  res across Ala-chua, Putnam, Marion and Gilchrist counties, Bond said. As of Wednes-day, that number had shrunk to 15.
After the rain, Bond said, North Florida dropped on the drought in-dex from the upper-moderate range to well within the normal range. 
Bond said spring months are the 
driest and busiest times for ﬁ  res.
Local farmers have witnessed 
this spring’s dryness ﬁ  rsthand.
“It gets really dusty ,” said Javier 
Landrua, a 21-year-old farmer at LaLa Land Organic Farms in Alach-ua. “It almost looks like a dust storm when the wind blows.”
The water helped his vegetables 
but also watered weeds and created fertile ground for insects.
“It brought new life to some of 
the plants,” Landrua said, “but it brought new problems, too.”

Police: Angry customer hits Taco 
Bell with truck
HUBER HEIGHTS, Ohio — 
Police in southwest Ohio say a 
customer angry over not getting a taco he ordered struck a Taco Bell restaurant’s glass entrance with his truck. No one was injured.
Huber Heights police say 
23-year-old Michael S. Smith or -
dered at a drive-up window in the Dayton suburb on Tuesday and later realized he was missing the taco. Officer Brandon Sucher says Smith returned to the restau-rant and had angry words with employees before striking the building.
Police tracked the truck’s fluid 
trail to Smith’s house a few miles away and arrested him on a van-dalism charge.
Sucher says Smith told police 
he hit the building accidentally after driving off fast and losing control of the truck.
There was no telephone list-
ing for Smith, and he could not immediately be reached for com-ment.

Drivers see scarf-wearing pig 
on Pittsburgh road
PITTSBURGH — Motorists 
have reported a sharp-dressed 
pig running loose on a highway just outside of Pittsburgh. State troopers also spotted the animal but failed to catch it before it scurried off into the woods.
The pig is wearing a scarf. The 
sightings were reported between 8:30 a.m. and 9 a.m. Wednesday just west of the city on Interstate 376, known locally as the Park-way West.
State troopers from the near -
by barracks in Findlay Township spotted the pig, but couldn’t catch up to it.
Police say the pig appeared 
to be a baby and confirmed it was wearing a scarf. Police don’t know why that is or who may own the animal.
Still, someone has created a 
Twitter account to chronicle the swine’s “exploits.” It’s at  www.twitter.com/sharpdressedpig.

start four weeks before the election and end when the polls close.
Several students went to the 
meeting to voice their opinions on the bill, but most of them did not talk. Instead they held up signs like Mohamad Shatara’s, which read, “I want to tell you about elections, but Christina Bonarrigo says I can’t.”  
Each sign featured a different author of the bill.Budget and Appropriations Com-
mittee chairwoman Christina Bonar -
rigo, an author of the bill, said the bill is just condensing the campaigning period.
“This bill doesn’t limit free speech, 
it limits campaigning year-round so Student Government can focus on re-sults,” she said.
The Senators also passed a bill 
that proposed to change the finance codes. That bill will be heard again in the Senate next week.

Apparel, Wednesday evening at Gifthorse, located on the corner of North Main Street and Southwest First Avenue.
SenA te,  from page 1Students protested silentlyNewman admitted to shooting Andrews
Hearing one more gunshot moments later, Jo-
seph Andrews fled the house and got in his van.  
Sgt. Todd Kelly of the Alachua County Sher -
iff’s Office said neighbors called police at 5:03 
p.m. The sheriff’s office responded with its SWAT team. Officers found Andrews inside his house and dragged him to his neighbor’s yard. Unsure if the shooter was still inside the house, officers called for K-9 units to respond.
Andrews was pronounced dead at the scene.Officers found a sliding glass door open at the 
back of the house, which the daughter said is nor -
mally kept locked, according to the arrest report.
The sheriff’s office also found three .38-caliber 
shell casings and a bullet lodged in a closet wall.Officers couldn’t find the silver ring in the girl’s 
bedroom after the shooting.
Earlier on Tuesday , Newman’s mother’s fiance, 
Kenneth Oliver, noticed his .38-caliber handgun was missing from the southwest Gainesville home he shares with Newman and Newman’s mother.
When Newman returned home Tuesday eve-
ning, Oliver asked him if he had been involved in the shooting in Waldo.
“Yes,” Newman said, according to the report.Oliver called the sheriff’s office while Newman 
cried with his mother inside their home.
Officers brought Newman back to the sheriff’s 
office, where he was charged with first-degree murder and taken to Alachua County Jail.
Newman declined to make a statement at the 
time of his arrest.

Strands of denim, uncapped highlight-
ers and makeup brushes cover the floors 
and tables of Darshay Davis’ home as bleach trickles down a once-plain pair of jeans into Tupperware.
Davis, a 20-year-old journalism sopho-
more, and Will Wynne, a 21-year-old fam-ily, youth and community sciences junior, created their own urban-style clothing line called Off White Apparel last month.
Davis and Wynne use materials found 
in most students’ homes to create their designs — highlighters, scissors, bleach, towels, needles and thread. 
But creating a finished product is more 
complex.
“We’ll have a pair of jeans and figure 
out how we want to cut it, like a ‘U’ cut, a diagonal ‘V,’ or just do them straight,” Wynne said. “But then maybe we’ll want a fringy look, so we’ll have to go through and pull apart each of the threads to get a nice fringe.”
After Davis and Wynne decide on a 
cut for a pair of shorts, they use highlight-ers to draw designs with bleach. 
The two then head down to their laun-
dry room to wash the clothing and decide if they want to make any more cuts.
“We’re trying to make a trademark 
now where we cut off the back pocket of every jean that we do so you know that’s something we did,” Wynne said. “Right now, we take a highlighter and write our trademark where the missing pocket is.”
Although the students sell most of 
their clothing out of their homes, some of Davis’ custom-made shorts became avail-able last week at Gifthorse, a small cloth-ing store on North Main Street.
Kerri Duffield, an associate at Gift-
horse, said she was interested in the shorts because they were creative and in-teresting.
“Cutoff, bleached shorts are kind of 
trendy right now,” she said. “I kind of had my eye on them for a while, and I thought this was perfect and something we would like to get into.”
On weekdays, when Davis and Wynne 
aren’t busy coming up with new designs, the two spend their time training as mem-bers of UF’s varsity track and field team.
Wynne, a two-time All-American hur -
dler, even worked out a deal with Mike Holloway, the head coach of the team, while he was being recruited.
Holloway told him he could make a 
uniform after the team won its first na-tional championship, Wynne said.
“Then we won one, and I said, ‘So I 
can make a uniform now, right?’” Wynne said. “We actually won two champion-ships, so I got to make two of them.”
Holloway said the team liked the uni-
forms.
“They’re really nice and came out re-
ally well,” he said. “He did a good job with them. The sprinters in particular like to run in them.”
Davis, a sprinter, and Wynne said they 
both have aspirations of becoming profes-sional runners.
Wynne said he wants to use profes-
sional running as a way to design track clothing for Nike.
But for now, the two athletes have one 
long-term goal in common for their new clothing line.
“We’re going to take over the world,” 
Davis said.UF track team members launch urban-style clothing lineTHURSDAY, MAY 31, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 5

A team including UF researchers de-
termined that a therapy could help treat a 
type of plasma cancer.
The team’s findings reveal that lenali-
domide maintenance therapy was effec-tive in helping prolong remission and lifespan after bone marrow transplants in patients with multiple myeloma, a cancer of the plasma cells. However, it was also associated with the development of sec-ondary cancers such as breast cancer and leukemia.
The report was published May 10 in 
the New England Journal of Medicine.
Dr. Jan S. Moreb, the clinical director of 
hematologic malignancies in UF College of Medicine’s hematology and oncology division, contributed to the study.
He said the benefits of the drug out-
weigh the risks.
“The incidence of secondary cancers is 
not that significant in comparison to the benefits they get from this treatment,” he said.
Moreb said lenalidomide stimulates the 
immune system and then slows the blood vessel creation that fuels the cancer.
The American Cancer Society estimates 
there will be 21,700 new cases diagnosed this year. People 67 and older are at the highest risk for the disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control.
“I think this is a milestone in the treat-
ment of myeloma,” he said. “I’m hoping that the new generation of this drug can possibly be more effective and [cause] less side effects and not cause an increase in secondary malignancies. This drug looks promising.”Medical report finds therapy

Students in an empire 
state of mind can get their Big 
Apple fix only a few miles away.
UF is daring students to at-
tempt the “Climb the Empire State Building Challenge” at Lake Wauburg.
Students have to climb the 
55-foot rock wall, located at Lake Wauburg’s north shore, 27 times to complete the chal-lenge. The total amount of climbing is equal to the trek to the top of the 1,454-foot-tall Empire State Building.“It’s my first time climbing 
the rock wall, and it certainly won’t be the last,” Kasey Sil-ver, a 22-year-old marketing senior, said.
Once they sign up, chal-
lengers can track their prog-ress throughout the summer.
Students can climb any of 
the 19 courses up to five times per visit.
All attempts must be com-
pleted by the July 22 deadline. The first 50 participants who complete the challenge will receive an exclusive T-shirt.
“I haven’t done a lot of 
rock climbing in my day, but if King Kong can do it, I’m sure I can,” Fabian Diaz, a 21-year-old English senior, said.Lake Wauburg offers

As UF nears the end of a heavily de-
bated budgeting process, faculty members 
took advantage of an open debate on Tues-day to ask UF President Bernie Machen questions about the university’s method of budgeting.
Machen said he had hoped the Florida 
Legislature would scale back on cuts to the university, but the state mandated UF cut $38 million from its budget for the up-coming fiscal year.
Last year, banking on a better situation 
in the future, Machen took $12 million out of UF reserves.
Now, though, he said UF will have to 
slash the budget in more permanent ways. Temporary cuts won’t be enough.
The university’s Board of Trustees will 
meet June 7 and June 8, when Machen will present a final budget proposal.Several faculty members asked him 
about undesignated funds and reserves.
Machen said some funds have yet to be 
spent, but the university does not have ex-tra, unaccounted-for reserve funds.
“There is no such thing as an undesig-
nated reserve,” he said.
Machen said UF is 
stretching funds, and he plans to ask the Florida Legislature to increase UF’s tuition by 15 per -
cent, the current limit.
When a faculty 
member asked about how UF is planning for 
the future, Machen said that for now, UF is investing primarily in faculty.
“If the faculty leave, we’ve got noth-
ing,” he said. “We’ve got a bunch of emp-ty buildings.”

While the literary merit of the recently hyped novel 
“Fifty Shades of Grey” is questionable, we must throw a just-because-it-offends-your-puritan-sensibilities-doesn’t-mean-it-deserves-to-be-censored DART at library ofﬁ  cials 
in Brevard County, Fla. 
The book was deemed “pornographic” by library servic-
es director Cathy “I know what’s best for you” Schweins-berg. Public libraries should not have the right to censor speech because they feel offended.
Due to the events unfolding in Miami recently, we 
think it’s time to give a the-end-is-nigh LAUREL to Zom-
bie Apocalypse 2012. Pick your weapon of choice, grab as many supplies as you can carry and ﬁ  nd a shelter to with-stand the attacks.
It has begun!For being incredibly opportunistic, we throw a thank-
fully-the-Alligator-is-independent-from-UF DART at the 
student government of the University of Nevada, Las Ve-gas for attempting to hijack school newspaper, the Rebel Yell. What could possibly go wrong with members of stu-dent government appointing the editor of the newspaper?
While you might have been annoyed at the weather this 
weekend, we’re giving a Smokey-Bear-ain’t-got-nothing-on-mother-nature LAUREL to the rain, which fortunately 
kept the wildﬁ  res contained.
Next up, we throw a LMFAO-at-the-idiots-who-made-
this-decision DART at administrators at Sable Elementa-
ry School in Aurora, Co., who suspended a 6-year-old boy for sexual harassment. While it’s absurd to expect that a 6-year-old boy would know anything about sex or harass-ment, the reason for his suspension is even weirder.
D’Avonte Meadows said to a girl, “I’m sexy and I know 
it,” a line from the popular song “I’m Sexy and I Know It” by the group LMFAO. Now this kid has a suspension on his permanent record because he quoted a song he didn’t understand. Good job, Sable Elementary.
Finally, for some somber news, we want to give a this-
one-hits-home LAUREL to Marina Keegan, a recent gradu-
ate and student journalist at Yale University who died this weekend in a car crash. 
Keegan was a columnist for the Yale Daily News, as 
well as a playwright. Her last column assured graduating students, “the best years of our lives are not behind us.”
And she was absolutely right.Have a fun and safe weekend, and be sure to check back 
next week.Memorial Day is a monument to character
This Memorial Day, perhaps more than most, I’m 
reminded of the contrasts between people and the things they choose to stand for in their lives. With 
all of the talk coming from the left about the imagined 1 percent versus the beleaguered 99 percent, it’s very easy to simply tune out these fabricated numbers and carry on.
However, there is a number that escapes many peo-
ple, particularly malcontents who stand around in parks complaining that somebody owes them something  — the silent 7 percent.
Only 7 percent of Americans have worn the uniform 
of their country, a choice that beneﬁ  ts 100 percent of us. And when one of these Americans goes into harm’s way, he or she doesn’t go alone. Mothers, fathers, spous-es and loved ones all bear the burden of their oaths.
But one thing you will never see these men and wom-
en doing is standing around whining about their lots in life. People who have lost limbs, vision or hearing, those who have held close friends as they breathed their last and people who might actually have something to com-plain about — they don’t. In an all-volunteer force where sacriﬁ  ce, perseverance and character are prized and in-stilled in every member, self-pity receives no quarter.
As a veteran, I take Memorial Day very seriously. For 
me personally, it is a time to honor my 35 fallen com-rades lost in the toe-to-toe ﬁ  ghting undertaken by the 2nd Battalion, 4th Marines in Iraq in 2004. It is a time when those who served in years past clap a hand on the shoulders of those now in uniform to encourage them, reinforce our bonds and remember those who came be-fore us. It is also a time for those who may have never worn the uniform to take a moment and reﬂ  ect on the freedoms that they enjoy, so dearly purchased by oth-ers.
As I look out at my nation today, I can’t help but be 
both concerned and encouraged by a few things. I am encouraged by the fact that more young people are enthusiastic about volunteering to serve their country than at any time since World War II.
Their amazing achievements 
and unwavering commitments are breathtaking to behold. Young men and women, many 
straight out of high school or college, are snatching victory after victory from the enemy under the most wretched of conditions, despite the efforts of irrespon-sible politicians who continually undercut them at every turn. These are the extraordinary 7 percent who stand in harm’s way on our behalf every single day.
I am also concerned by the politics of envy and the 
culture of entitlement coming from certain quarters. As they declare their cause a class struggle between the 99 percent and the 1 percent, all the while sipping lattes at Starbucks and tweeting from their iPhones, I can’t help but feel that I’m watching history repeat itself.
Surely these self-absorbed brats spouting their Marx-
ist slogans and platitudes are carbon copies of the mis-creants from the 1960s who spat on returning Vietnam veterans and called them “baby-killers.” Even if one charitably disregards the truly ignorant things they’re saying, their public behavior and hygiene invite the comparison.
Still, I’m certain that, as our nation’s history has borne 
out time and again, the extraordinary freedoms enjoyed by a grateful nation shall be the enduring monument to the selﬂ  ess, while the ungrateful and self-absorbed will once again slink back into shamed obscurity.

� RONALD POPPO COULD BE 
THREATENED BY INFECTION.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
A homeless man whose face was mostly 
chewed off in a bizarre, vicious attack faces 
a bigger threat from infection than from the injuries themselves, according to experts on facial reconstruction. He will require months of treatment to rebuild his features and will be permanently disfigured.
Though gruesome, such severe facial 
injuries are generally not life-threatening. The most serious risk to Ronald Poppo as he remained hospitalized Wednesday were germs that may have been introduced by the bites of the naked man who attacked him. One of the 65-year-old’s eyes was also gouged out.
“The human mouth is basically filthy,” 
said Dr. Seth Thaller, the chief of plastic and reconstructive surgery at the University of Miami’s Miller School of Medicine.
It’s not clear why Poppo was attacked 
Saturday afternoon by 31-year-old Rudy Eugene alongside a busy highway. Police have released few details, but surveillance video from a nearby building shows Eugene pulling Poppo from the shade, stripping and pummeling him before appearing to hunch over and then lie on top of him.
A witness described Eugene ripping at 
Poppo’s face with his mouth and growling at a Miami police officer who ordered him to get off the homeless man. The officer shot and killed Eugene.Eugene’s younger brother said he was a 
sweet person who didn’t drink much or use hard drugs.“I wish they didn’t kill him so he could 
tell us exactly what happened. This is very uncharacteristic of him,” said the brother, who asked for anonymity to protect his fam-ily.
Police union officials representing the 
officer said the scene on the MacArthur Causeway was one of the goriest they had ever seen.
“He had his face eaten down to his goa-
tee. The forehead was just bone. No nose, no mouth,” said Sgt. Armando Aguilar, presi-dent of the Miami Fraternal Order of Police.
Poppo has been in critical condition in 
recent days, but police didn’t give an update on his condition Wednesday.
Thaller, who is not treating Poppo, and 
other plastic surgeons said the rebuilding of Poppo’s face would happen in stages after doctors try to keep his wounds clean, salvage viable tissue and determine a plan for skin grafts. Protecting his remaining eye and maintaining an airway are priorities.
To keep the wounds clean, doctors use 
grafts of the patient’s skin, cadaver skin or synthetic skin to cover the exposed bone or cartilage, said Dr. Blane Shatkin, a plastic surgeon and director of the wound healing center at Memorial Hospital Pembroke in South Florida. The coverage would act like a dressing, protecting the wound as it heals.
Poppo’s lifestyle and health before the 
attack could determine how doctors pro-ceed and whether they eventually consider a facial transplant, plastic surgeons said. 8, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, MAY 31, 2012

A local magazine will show the variety of restaurants in 
Gainesville while raising money for charity Sunday.
Taste of HOME Gainesville will feature foods from 32 lo-
cally owned restaurants and four bars.
The event, hosted by HOME Magazine, will benefit Chil-
dren’s Home Society of Florida, Child Advocacy Center and 
Tyler’s Hope for a Dystonia Cure Inc., publisher Scott Costello said.The event runs from 5 p.m. to 9 p.m.Costello said he expects more guests than attended last year, 
and 600 tickets have already been sold. Tickets are $75 each.
Restaurant owners said the event gives them an opportu-
nity to advertise while raising money for good causes.
“It allows us to get out there and promote our business while making a lot of difference,” said Ryan Todd, owner of Embers Wood Grill. Embers has participated in Taste of HOME since it began, he said. 
The Iron Chef Gainesville competition will take place in the 
Hilton main ballroom during the event, Costello said. The dish cooked by the winner will be auctioned off.
Embers executive chef and co-owner Briton Dumas is the 
Iron Chef Gainesville’s defending champion, Todd said. The chef has been preparing for the competition for half a year.
“It’s a lot of fun for us to get out there and cook and meet 
new people,” he said.Gainesville magazine hosts restaurant event for charity

When Lauren Wysocki reaches into the 
fridge for a midnight snack, she goes straight 
for the Ben & Jerry’s Cherry Garcia.
A new study conducted by Massive 
Health shows that Wysocki isn’t alone in her late-night junk food consumption. The whole world does it.
The study used data from the iPhone ap-
plication Eatery. It found that healthiness in food consumption decreases by 1.7 percent every hour.
Wysocki, a 19-year-old applied physiol-
ogy and kinesiology sophomore, said the study makes sense.
“At night, people don’t get cravings for 
salads,” she said. “They get cravings for ice cream.”
Andrew J. Rosenthal, Massive Health’s 
chief strategy officer, said the trend is obvi-ous on college campuses.
“If you go out on a college campus on a Thursday night late, you’ll see people stop-ping and getting pizza after going to a bar,” he said.
Eatery, the application used in the study, 
lets users snap photos of food, then record where and when they ate it. Other users rate the food on its perceived healthiness.
Rosenthal also said the data found week-
ends to be unhealthier. 
That’s when the application’s users drank 
1.6 times as much beer as on weekdays.Study finds people are more unhealthy than they estimate

A new sales tax referendum is 
creating a rift between the city and 
county commissions.
The controversial initiative aims 
to fund only public road projects in Alachua County if the county com-mission decides to put it on the bal-lot in November.
The issue stems from the county 
commission’s decision to kill a sales tax referendum for Gainesville’s Regional Transit System during a meeting on May 22.In January , the county proposed 
a 1-cent sales tax referendum to fund transportation projects to nine Alachua county cities if approved by voters in November.
The county commission request-
ed all nine cities submit transporta-tion projects that could be funded by the proposal. The city commission proposed new bus projects, which includes improved bus stops and replacement buses.
On March 29, the county com-
mission voted 3-2 to split the trans-portation tax into two different ref-erendums: a 3/4-cent sales tax  to fund road projects and a 1/4-cent sales tax to fund Gainesville’s public transportation projects.
Under the 
new plan, the city 
would receive about 24.4 per -
cent of the $22.5 million raised an-nually from the 3/4-cent tax and a projected $82.5 million over the 
next 15 years.
The 1/4-cent tax would generate 
approximately $7.5 million annually and a projected $112.5 million over the same time period.
On May 14, the city commis-
sion voted 6-1 to approve interlocal agreements with the county for the roads and transit sales tax initia-tives.
During a county commission 
meeting on May 22, commissioners voted 3-2 to kill the 1/4-cent transit tax and considered moving the 3/4-cent tax to the November ballot.
Mark Sexton, Alachua County 
spokesman, said the commission felt the most important issue was to improve Alachua County’s road in-frastructure. 
Commissioner Thomas Hawk-
ins, however, disagrees with the county’s decision to kill the transit sales tax proposal, saying the 1/4-cent tax will focus on roads with no funds going to sidewalks.
“It’s fundamentally an ideologi-
cal opposition to transit and to walk-ing as ways of getting around,” he said.
Bob Woods, Gainesville city 
spokesman, said the city commis-sion will discuss a response to the county’s vote during the city com-mission meeting on June 7.

Coffee shops come in many forms — 
chain shops in strip malls, meet-ups for 
students to discuss literature and play board games or drive-thrus for conve-nience on the way to work. 
The CYM Coffee Co., opening June 23 
from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m., offers its own en-vironment as a meeting place to foster cre-ativity and hold events.
“It’ll be more of a community environ-
ment than a drive-thru or sitting on a con-crete slab in front of the parking lot,”said Brad Neal, one of the six co-founders of Cymplify, a life empowerment project that the coffee house is based off of.  
The coffee shop gets its name, CYM, 
from a Sister Hazel song titled “Change Your Mind.” The band’s lead singer, Ken Block, is one of the co-founders. The proj-ect acts as an extension of the song, with lyrics: “If you want to be somebody else/If you’re tired of fighting battles with your -
self/If you want to be somebody else/Change your mind.”
“Our mission is to have a good time do-
ing meaningful stuff,” said Brad’s brother, Dave Neal, a co-founder. He is a UF alum-nus with a degree in anthropology and a background in corporate training.
The project was born in Ken Block fam-
ily’s kitchen after discussing what the per -
fect weekend would be, Ken Block said.
“What we all kind of agreed to was a 
perfect weekend would be something where you got to hang out with people you like, where you got to grow personally or professionally,” Ken Block said.
Block, his wife, Tracy Block and the Neal 
brothers grew up together in Gainesville.
“This is all of our home,” Brad Neal 
said. “and even though we’ve kind of ven-
tured off and chased careers in other cities, we all came back to Gainesville.”
The other co-founders are Tara Blythe, 
who is involved in the UF Leadership De-velopment Institute, and Joel Cobden, who provides merchandising experience.
The group put together personal and 
professional development experiences to  create core values of integrity, camarade-rie, fun, growth and giving back.
The coffee house will serve as a central-
ized location for Cymplify to reach out to the community with events and activities such as sponsoring a tennis match in Con-necticut, where Cobden lives.
“We want to do more of that, where we 
can connect with events we believe in,” Dave Neal said.
Tracy Block, a mother of three, has 
plans to start a grassroots parent initiative.   The whole Cymplify group is working on a partnership with the UF Leadership De-velopment Institute.
The grand opening will also serve as a 
summer celebration and will feature free coffee, speakers and local artists and musi-cians. The shop plans to hold similar festi-vals for each season, Dave Neal said.
Strongtree Organic Coffee Roasters will 
provide beans for the coffee. 
Gainesville’s Flour Pot Bakery will pro-
vide baked goods.
The shop is opening in Greenery Square 
off of Northwest Eighth Avenue.
“Growing up here, this was a vibrant 
property,” Brad Neal said. “Since then, the square has lost some of its luster.”
“This whole house needed some love 
in the worst kind of way,” Brad Neal said, “and we were just thrilled to be able to provide some and try to rebuild our com-munity and hopefully help turn our econ-omy and this community around.”
Brad Brooks, the owner of Gardeners 
Edge, a plant nursery in Greenery Square, said he is excited about the new business.
“It’s getting a lot more promising now 
that they’re here,” Brooks said, “now that there’s someone else on the property that’s like minded and wants to revitalize this property.”
To simplify Cymplify, Ken Block sug-
gests stopping by to find out firsthand what it’s all about.
“It all starts with a cup of coffee,” he 
said.

Not many artists can say they have 
had Jack White as a critic.
A Gainesville art trio can. While re-
cently displaying artwork in New York, 
they had a run-in with the former White Stripes singer.
Felici Asteinza, Evan Galbicka and 
Joey Fillastre are artists who specialize in painting, sculpture, collage and mural at The Church of Holy Colors gallery in downtown Gainesville. Holy Colors is not a church, but the intensity of creating in the space can be a spiritual feeling for those involved.
The three artists of Holy Colors met the 
newly solo White while painting a mural on a large fence outside of the Brooklyn gallery where they were displaying their art. White, who was in town for the funer-al of Beastie Boys member Adam “MCA” Yauch, walked out of the gallery, saw them and joked, “Damn grafﬁ  ti kids,” but stuck around for a bit to chat and admire their work.
“You can tell he is really passion-
ate about his projects — it’s inspiring,” Asteinza said.
That wasn’t their ﬁ  rst exhibition and will not be their last. They have been on an unofﬁ  cial art tour, recently setting up displays in Manhattan and Jacksonville. They are heading to Miami at the end of June and New Orleans in October.
“Ever since we got this space two years 
ago, we’ve been dreaming about traveling to these places,” Galbicka said.
Though the artists’ themes and styles 
are ever-changing, they have completed Florida themed paintings, psychedelic murals, thought provoking collages and large tree sculptures. Many of their paint-ings have so many acrylic layers that the paint protrudes from the canvas and cre-ates a 3-D sculpture effect.
The artists will continue to defy typi-
cal art norms when they travel to Miami to create and display art with their new themes, which use donated ropes and ani-mals bones.

In the woods off of Southeast 
16th Avenue and Williston Road 
lives 36-year-old Sam Parrish. He built a home there; a tent reinforced with a tarp, a futon, a cot and solar powered lights next to a creek. 
Parrish has many neighbors 
and said he hopes that residents of Gainesville will want to join his 
community . 
Parrish also built an amphithe-
ater out of logs to create a free mu-
sic venue where bands can come to play, eat and even sleep.
About three years ago, Parrish 
started a YouTube channel that features his favorite musicians.  He made it just in case his laptop broke, that way he would still be able to access his music.  
Today, the channel, called arti-
chokeification, has more than 1,500 subscribers and 2 million views. 
The featured bands want to 
come and play in the amphitheater he built to show their appreciation.   Gainesville man

For five years, UF Young Entrepreneurs for 
Leadership and Sustainability has given stu-
dents a taste of campus life as they complete ser -
vice projects to aid the Gainesville community.
Young Entrepreneurs for Leadership and 
Sustainability connects students with speakers and mentors who provide insight into achiev-ing success through entrepreneurship.  It strives to educate students about creating solutions for the social, environmental and economic issues 
affecting the community.
This summer, the Young Entrepreneurs will 
pilot a new program, YELS: Gainesville Summer 
Service Project, focusing more heavily on the importance of the environment and its preserva-tion.
This is an outlet for high school students to 
give back to the community and a new opportu-nity to embrace sustainability and have an im-pact on social problems.Students will earn 100 hours of community 
service as they volunteer for five weeks at local farms and community outreach programs.
The program will partner with Rebuilding 
Together North Central Florida, which aims to provide emergency repairs and improve the safety of substandard housing for low-income families.
The program will also partner with Forage 
Farm at Alachua Conservation Trust’s Prairie Creek Preserve, which was founded this year. The farm offers educational workshops designed to connect children and adults to nature.
The YELS: Gainesville Summer Service Proj-
ect will run weekdays from June 25 to July 27 from 8:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. Participation costs $1,250, and interested students should apply at http://ufyoungentrepreneurs.org/gssp.
Dr. Kristin Joos, director of the project, is also 
a lecturer at UF’s department of sociology and criminology and law.
The project is sponsored by the Innovative 
Sustainability & Social Entrepreneurship Initia-tive at UF.UF club starts community service 
program for high school students community
“...I set out to find a 
place where I could start 
something positive where 
people with like minds can 
help each other.”
Sam Parrish
Gainesville resident
Asteinza said. “It’s a way to phys-
ically get away from the painting and create some space.”
The art will be displayed June 
24 to 28 in the Freedom Tower in downtown Miami, part of Mi-ami Dade College. The artists will partner with different musicians who will play during the creation process. The music will be record-ed and played back during the display period.
“It’s going to be an inten-
sive creation process during that week,” Galbicka said. “Everything will be made on-site.”
In addition, the artists recently 
raised more than $8,500 on Kick-starter, an online fundraising plat-form, to begin converting an old school bus into an eco-friendly touring vehicle that can run on old vegetable oil. Galbicka said they eventually want a whole fleet of buses to house touring artists and musicians.
“Portal culture is what we’ve 
been calling it,” Galbicka added.
They are 
currently look-ing for the bus 
and have com-missioned a friend to begin converting it as soon as it’s pur -
chased.
The artists said they enjoy the 
traveling but also look forward to getting back to Gainesville.  
“We’re trying to get more 
involved with the community — that’s really important to us,” Asteinza said.JESSICA KEGU

Both Megan Alfaro and Janice Erlacher like wearing 
bones, stones and vintage clothes. Last summer they de-
cided to turn their style into a business.
The result was Bermuda Dream, an online store that 
sells handcrafted and vintage clothing, jewelry and acces-sories to customers in the U.S., Australia, New Zealand, Canada and many countries in Europe. With more than 800 likes on its Facebook page and daily sales for the past two months, co-founder Alfaro said she is certain what now pays half of her bills will eventually pay all of them.
Alfaro, 26, graduated last December from Santa Fe 
College with a degree in graphic design and Erlacher, 25, graduated from UF last May with a degree in anthro-pology. They began putting their business together as a two-woman operation in June 2011 despite Erlacher’s approaching move to Los Angeles, giving them only one month to get their online Etsy shop running. Etsy is a web-site that connects consumers and sellers, similar to eBay, but exclusively for handcrafted and vintage items.
“We took what we call a ‘fear and loathing in Florida’ 
trip from here to Fort Myers in search of the coolest stuff in the state,” Alfaro said.
For Alfaro, one of the most important reasons behind 
the business is the idea that consumers should be aware of what clothing companies are doing with their money.
“In a sense, I’m against brands,” she said. She thinks 
Bermuda Dream represents a sort of anti-brand — though that doesn’t mean they don’t have a distinct aesthetic.
Likewise for her partner, the idea of sustainability and 
recycling materials is paramount.
“Even when we hopefully start making and designing 
our own clothing in the future, it will always be made from recycled or vintage fabrics or from eco-friendly ma-terials,” Erlacher said.
The biggest challenges the two have faced have been 
operating the business from opposite sides of the coun-try and starting it from the ground up. The duo designs, models, crafts and runs everything on the business end themselves.“I took business classes as a freshman in college, but 
that was a long time ago. Everything has been a learning process, and we haven’t really had a mentor,” Erlacher said.
Right now, Erlacher is background acting in Los An-
geles and networking for Bermuda Dream while on set. “It’s great, everybody from the wardrobe people to the makeup artists and other actors get to see our stuff,” she said
In regards to the future, Alfaro said they are working 
on building their own site and plan on making more items themselves as well as branching into other areas such as home decor and screen printing.Both women say they are passionate about what they 
do, and to see their hard work paying off — literally — is the best feeling, especially at a time when so many young people are feeling the pressure to pursue more practical and secure professions.   
As for the name, Alfaro said it came to her the same 
day her partner happened to have a dream about them together on a boat, and just as you can get lost in your d r e a m s ,  y o u  c a n  g e t  l o s t  i n  t h e  B e r m u d a  Tr i a n g l e .                                                        
They have aspirations to one day open their own phys-
ical store where they can feature artwork by their friends along with their own work, but in true gypsy fashion, they have no idea where or when that may be.12, ALLIGATOR §  THURSDAY, MAY 31, 2012

Janice Erlacher and Megan Alfaro model their own apparel.  The two women started Bermuda Dream, a clothing 
store that sells vintage and handmade clothing, jewelry and accessories.

“You shouldn’t have to dress a certain way to be as-
sociated with a certain style of music or deal with any 
of the hassles that come with house and bar shows,” he said. “I’m trying to break down those walls and offer a place where musicians and music lovers can come and feel free.”
The first official event was Monday at 6 p.m., and 
people were welcome to stay as long as they wanted. The show was moved to Parrish’s living area because of the rain. Free food was served, but donations were accepted.
Kiki Chidiac, a 20-year-old economics senior 
and co-worker of Parrish’s, attended the show and brought her hula hoops.
“I think what Sam is doing is awesome,” she said. 
“I’m seeing that you can live free and still have a nor -
mal existence.”
Parrish works as a chef at Reggae Shack and uses 
the money he makes to buy food to cook on the open fire and serve to the homeless.           
He said he once made apricot-Dijon glazed pork 
chops but usually gets hot dogs or hamburgers and things that can be bought in bulk and easily shared. One time he found 28 frozen pizzas in a Dumpster, found a way to cook them on the grill and gave them to the homeless.
Parrish first moved to his current home this year 
on New Year’s Day, after reading several books about living free, breaking the chains of the landlord struc-ture and building a community.
“I got fed up with paying rent and my neighbors 
who only complained,” he said. “So I set out to find a place where I could start something positive where people with like minds can help each other.”
He admitted that he didn’t like it for the first two 
weeks, but after he started cooking for people in ex-change for their stories, he was soon able to call it home and build a community .  
“It’s so soothing to go home and read a book by 
the creek,” he said. “I never have stress anymore.”
Although the community is part 
of Tent City, a southeast Gainesville homeless community that is asso-ciated with crime, Parrish insists those who live there only want to help and share the little they have.
The featured video on his channel is a song called 
“Community Love Song” by the Moon Bandits. The chorus of the song echoes Parrish’s main goal: “We’ll have community one day, build a family out of strang-ers down the way.”
He plans to have more shows in July and August, 
and his dream is to eventually have a food truck where he can offer discounts, jobs and leftovers to the homeless.
“You don’t have to be a bum to be homeless and 
live free,” he said. “And you don’t have to have a home to be a part of something good.”Parrish plans to have more concerts

Needing just three outs to ad-
vance to the Southeastern Confer -
ence Tournament final, Gators clos-
er Austin Maddox took the mound.
Maddox entered Florida’s 8-6 
SEC semifinal loss to Vanderbilt to pitch the ninth with a team-best 1.43 ERA and a conference-leading 12 saves.
Nine batters later, he walked 
back to the dugout with a blown save.“Austin’s a big part of our pitch-
ing, he had a bad inning,” coach Kevin O’Sullivan said last Saturday. “It’s as simple as that.” 
The junior right-hander surren-
dered five earned runs on five hits, issued two walks, hit a batter and failed to record a strikeout in his worst statistical outing this season. However, the most crippling blow the Commodores dealt Maddox in the Gators’ first ninth-inning loss this season did not come from the batter’s box.
Vanderbilt tied an SEC Tourna-
ment record with six stolen bases in the top of the ninth inning, includ-ing a rare triple steal.
Vandy shortstop Anthony 
Gomez got the ball rolling when he tagged Maddox for the go-ahead single with two outs. Gomez  stole second, and Maddox intention-ally walked first baseman Conrad Gregor to re-establish the force out.
However, Gomez and Gregor 
executed a double steal, forcing Maddox to give catcher Spencer Navin a free pass and load the bases for designated hitter Will Cooper.
On Maddox’s second offering to 
Cooper, all three runners took off. Each advanced safely, and Gomez crossed home plate before Florida catcher Mike Zunino could apply the tag.
“Closers, they don’t necessarily 
do a great job of holding runners,” O’Sullivan said last Saturday. “They don’t have many base run-ners to begin with.”
Reliever Greg Larson added: “It 
happens, they got some guys who can run. Hopefully, [Maddox] will learn from it and make some ad-justments this week in practice and carry it into the postseason.”
Vandy scored two more runs af-
ter the triple steal to take an 8-4 lead UF was unable to overcome in the bottom half of the inning.
In all, the Commodores stole 
seven bases in nine attempts against the Gators, exposing a weakness that has mostly gone unnoticed this season.
UF has allowed 52 stolen bases, 
which ranks as the third-highest mark in the SEC. Zunino has caught a career-high 19 runners stealing this season, but his stolen bases-al-lowed percentage is still 7.1 points higher than his personal-best 63.2 clip in 2010.
Top-seeded Florida (42-18) hosts 
No. 4 seed Bethune-Cookman (34-25) for the third time this season in the Gainesville NCAA Regional on Friday night at 7. 
After seeing how the Gators’ 
SEC Tournament run ended, the Wildcats may try to test Zunino this weekend. Led by speedy outfielder Josh Johnson’s 27 steals, Bethune-Cookman is the second-best base-stealing team Florida has faced this season, trailing only Auburn. The Wildcats rank 12th in the nation with 102 stolen bases; the Tigers are seventh — and lead the SEC — with 113.
However, Bethune-Cookman 
did not put its 78.5 stolen-base per -
centage on the line much against Florida.
In two games against the Gators

STAFF REPORT
 
Florida went into the second day of the NCAA Champion-
ships tied at second overall. 
By the end of the second round Wednesday, the Gators had 
descended in the ranks at the Riviera Country Club in Pacific 
Palisades, Calif.
Florida shot a 296 (+12) and fell into a tie for eighth place with 
Kent State, USC, California and Illinois.
Tyler McCumber carried the Gators in the first 
round and did the same on Wednesday.
McCumber followed up his 68 (-3) in the 
opening round with a 71 (E) in the second round, remaining tied for second with Anton Arboldea 
of UCLA at 139 (-3).
McCumber would be tied for first had he not double bogeyed 
the second hole, a par four. The setback dropped him to even par, where he remained for the rest of the round.
None of the other Gators were able to match McCumber’s 
success .
Junior T.J. Vogel carded Florida’s second-best score with a 74 
(+3) in the second round. Vogel birdied two holes, but bogeyed Gators stumble from 
second to eighth at NCAA Championships

For sophomore distance run-
ner Cory McGee, the 1,500-me-
ter race is always the event she puts her heart into.
At the NCAA East Prelimi-
nary Round this past weekend, her effort paid off.
McGee secured a spot at the 
NCAA Outdoor Champion-ships in the 1,500m for a second consecutive season with a time of 4:16.36.
In the preliminary 1,500m 
race, McGee ran alongside ju-niors Mandy Perkins and Agata Strausa in the same heat. 
“It’s really nice because we 
know what each other are ca-pable of,” McGee said.
“If one of us starts to fall 
back, we can always help each other out again.”
McGee previosuly qualified 
for the U.S. Olympic trials in the 1,500m with a personal-best mark of 4:12.61 at Stanford’s Payton Jordan Cardinal Invita-tional on April 29.
McGee credits her success to 
the familiarity she feels when her teammates are racing on the 
track along-side her.
“ G e t t i n g 
out on the track and knowing 
those girls you count on ev-ery single day in all parts of 
your life are right next to you, it just adds a whole other degree of a support system,” McGee said.McGee credits her

two bags in three tries. All three at-tempts came in the second meeting, a 10-1 UF win.
  Florida has struggled to achieve

year, and I think we’re all looking for-ward to starting a new season,” he said. 
“We deﬁ  nitely have a lot of upside 
and [the No. 1 seed] just shows we’ve persevered through a lot of things and we’ve still got everything right in front of us.”

U.S. Olympic trials in April
        When running on the track, McGee 
looks out for her teammates. During the 
ﬁ  rst round of the 1,500m this past week-end, McGee offered some motivation to Perkins.
    “Mandy hadn’t been to Regionals 
before,” McGee said. “On the ﬁ  rst lap I was like, ‘Stay up here, Mandy!’ and cheering for her in the race.”
McGee has even altered her racing 
strategy to help her teammates get into better position.
At the Southeastern Conference Out-
door Championships, McGee assumed the role of “the rabbit,” by taking the lead late in the race and setting a faster pace.
McGee’s maneuver set up Genevieve 
LaCaze to ﬁ  nish with a personal-best time of 4:13.44 and the victory. McGee was runner-up.     “Turning up [May 13] in the 1,500m 
and having so many girls in the race, it helped having Cory take the lead with 600 meters to go,” LaCaze said.
McGee will be heading to the NCAA 
Outdoor Championships as the Gators’ sole competitor for the women’s 1,500m. 
While she will not have her team-
mates racing with her, McGee is still conﬁ  dent in her chances to pull out a victory.
    “I still feel fresh,” McGee said. “I feel 
really conﬁ  dent and healthy, and I think it’s all going to come into place really well this next month with the NCAAs and the [Olympic] trials.”       TRACK , from page 18

By now, Tony McQuay has told the story many times. 
In June 2011, McQuay competed in the U.S.A. Champion-
ships where in the preliminary round for the 400m, he finished with a time of 45.25. 
He won that round to advance to semifinals. There he had 
to race against Jeremy Wariner, who won the gold medal in the 2004 Olympics and the silver medal in the 2008 Olympics.
“I had to sleep with that all night,” McQuay said. “I was 
like, ‘Man I have to race the second fastest man ever to run the 400.’ And I thought, ‘Man he won the Olympics, so he’s prob-ably going to blow me out of the water, and I’m going to em-barrass myself.’”
But he didn’t embarrass himself.“We raced, and I beat him. I ran [44.68], which was my [per -
sonal record] at that time, and I was excited about it,” McQuay said. “But I could see he was kind of upset. So then I had some-thing else to worry about because I’m thinking, ‘Well, he isn’t going to let me beat him in front of all these people the next day when it comes to the finals.’”
Although he was only one race away from becoming the 
U.S. Champion in the 400m, McQuay didn’t always have the love he does now for track.
  
Speed was not something McQuay struggled with.“Ever since I was growing up with my friends, I’ve always 
been the fastest kid on the block. It was a gift,” McQuay said.
In the sixth grade, McQuay was juggling football, band and 
track. Because of his involvement in so many activities, his grades began to slip and he had to give up one. 
“My dad didn’t want me to quit the band because my band 
director was in band with him,” McQuay said. “So I quit foot-ball and stuck with band and track.”
Although he gave up football in middle school, McQuay 
started playing again in high school, and this time, he wanted to get away from track. However, when football season ended, his coach encouraged him to do track. 
McQuay did, but not without a fight. “I was hard-headed at one point,” McQuay said. “I would 
just say, ‘Coach, I don’t need to go to track practice all the time; I’m with the football team.” 
His love for football may have been greater, but McQuay 
knew he’d have problems playing the sport past high school.
Despite the initial resistance, McQuay credits the support 
from those close to him, especially his mom ,who was a former track coach, for sticking with track. 
And his mom, Lynda McQuay , couldn’t have been happier 
about his choice.
“I was extremely , extremely happy ,” she said. “Football was 
Tony’s heart. I just supported him in whatever he chose, but I was glad he chose track at a collegiate level over football.”
  McQuay had another problem with track — injuries. His freshman year of high school was derailed due to a 
tailbone injury he suffered during football practice. His sopho-more year was also cut short.
McQuay was stretching when a teammate stepped on his 
calf and slashed it open with his spikes. 
During his junior year in high school, McQuay was healthy 
up until regionals, where a bad start hurt his hamstrings.
McQuay finally enjoyed a healthy season as a senior.“He ran very well at the state meet his senior year, and we 
noticed him then,” coach Mike Holloway said.
In college, his hamstrings caused more problems. The worst 
instance came during the 2011 NCAA Indoor Championships.
“I heard a coach from Texas A&M yelling at his athlete, ‘Go 
now, you need to beat him to straight,’” McQuay said. “I saw him come up on my inside, and he tried to go around me. I guess I reacted to it too suddenly , and I felt it grab on me. I didn’t back off of it, I just ran through it.”
McQuay won that race to advance to the 400m finals. De-
spite the pain, he competed the next day and placed seventh, which earned UF two team points. McQuay spent a majority of the following outdoor season rehabbing from his injury . 
“I actually had to train harder because that injury set me 
back from where I needed to be,” McQuay said. “Being in so much pain, it was difficult for me to come out here every day.”
  
As the Gators start competition in the NCAA Outdoor 
Championships, a healthy McQuay will be looking for his first NCAA 400m title in the outdoor season to go along with his indoor 400m title that he won earlier this year. 
“He’s a fierce competitor,” Holloway said. “He’s a team 
leader, but in a quiet way. He’s had a phenomenal career.”
The junior sprinter will then go on to compete in the Olym-
pic trials at the end of the month in hopes of competing once again for the U.S. For McQuay, competing against the world’s best in London this summer is a shared dream. 
“My mom always talks about the Olympics,” McQuay said. 
“Ever since I got to college, I kind of backed away from my love of football and started thinking more about the Olympics.
“So, at this point, it would be a dream come true to actually 
go to the Olympics and win.”
But no matter what happens at the Olympic trials, his mom 
will still be thrilled with his performance. 
“I don’t have any words to express how proud I am of Tony ,” 
Lynda McQuay said. “Tony just gives so much of himself, and he inspires a lot of his teammates.”
  
When it came time to run in the 400m finals at the 2011 
U.S.A. Championships, McQuay had the same nervous feeling that he felt before the semifinals.
“I had so much pressure on me because I knew Jeremy 
(Wariner) was coming back and wanting to beat me,” he said. 
McQuay recalls guys like Calvin Smith getting out to a good lead, and the other runners passing him on the second curve. But McQuay trusted his coaching. 
“I remember my coach  told me, ‘If anybody tries to come 
up on your inside (on the curve), don’t tighten up, just relax they’ll come back to you,’” McQuay said. 
Once he got around the curve and hit the 80-meter mark, 
McQuay took off down the homestretch and passed Wariner.
“The crowd was going crazy, and I was like, ‘Oh, my God, 
I’m winning. I’m winning, I’m winning, I’m winning, I’m win-ning, I’m winning,” McQuay said. “At that point, I just wanted to hurry up and get to the finish line. It was just so exciting.”
If I could relive that moment, I would relive it every day. It 
was the best feeling ever.”
