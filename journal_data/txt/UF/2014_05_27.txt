� BUCKMAN GETS AC THIS SUMMER.

By 2015, all UF residence halls will have 
central air conditioning. 
This summer, Oelrich Construction Inc. 
is installing central air conditioning in Buck-man Hall for about $1.3 million, and Charles 
Perry Partners Inc. is replacing the windows in Thomas Hall for $1.6 million, according to an email from Sharon Blansett, assistant to the associate vice president for Student Affairs.
Next summer, central air conditioning 
units will be installed in Thomas Hall for $1.7 million. Residence halls that previously didn’t have central air only had wall units, or stu-dents were allowed to bring their own cooling devices.  Blansett wrote that $4 to $6 million is set aside each year from rent proﬁ  ts for resi-dence hall renovations and repairs.
For Sara Wedemeyer, a 19-year-old UF 
geology sophomore, air conditioning is a wel-come addition.
“Things change, and time changes,” she 
said. “So if these dorms change, their popular-ity would change because they wouldn’t cater to today’s living.” 
Jackie Ramos, a 20-year-old UF nutritional 
science senior, said although it’s nice to have air conditioning, the buildings, some of the ﬁ  rst residence halls at UF, are losing history.
“There isn’t going to be anything left from 
the past,” she said. “They’ll be just like any other building at UF.”By 2015, all Gators in residence halls will be cool

Out of all the cities in the U.S., a foreign 
startup company chose to open its ﬁ  rst  U.S. lo-
cation in Gainesville’s Innovation Square, and a UF alumnus is heading the location.  
Zeeko Ltd., a UK-based technology com-
pany, manufactures intelligent robotic polish-ers, which have been used to polish high preci-sion optics, among other things. Most notably, Zeeko’s products were used to polish the optics on NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. 
“The research coming out of the Uni-
versity of Florida is what drew attention to Gainesville,” wrote Arthur Graziano, direc-tor of the Zeeko’s Gainesville facility and UF alumnus, in an email interview.    
Graziano said Zeeko’s staff is excited to 
work with Hitomi Yamaguchi Greenslet, an associate professor in UF’s Center for Manu-facturing Innovation. Greenslet is an expert in magnetic abrasive ﬁ  nishing, which is technol-ogy Zeeko aims to incorporate into its existing products.
Trimark Properties has partnered up with 
Zeeko to develop the new 1,080-square-foot fa-cility, wrote John Fleming, Trimark Properties managing partner, in an email.
“Our relationship with Zeeko is just begin-
ning, as it is with Zeeko’s new relationship with Gainesville and Innovation Square,” Fleming said.UK robotic company to make US debut in GNV� THIS IS THE FIRST TIME.

Alachua County Fire Rescue’s 
Emergency Management Division 
is assembling a volunteer Fire Corps for the ﬁ  rst time in its history. 
The program, which began na-
tionally in 2004, is accepting appli-cations from volunteers to help out in nonemergency positions.  
“This program would let us uti-
lize resources that citizens have to help the ofﬁ  ce while also trying to teach the public ...  about ﬁ  re,” said Ebbin Spellman, Alachua County Emergency Management coordina-tor. 
Tasks of volunteers include de-
signing websites and providing ad-ministrative assistance. Applicants must be 18 years or older and can apply online until Aug. 29. 
The County Commission ap-
proved the grant for the program after about four years, Spellman said. But the only cost involved would be conducting background checks. 
Rebecca Creech, a 21-year-old 
UF forest resources and conserva-tion graduate student, said she’s been looking for a similar program.“I would do as much as they would let me do,” she said.Alachua

In a story that ran online Thursday, the Alligator incor-rectly said that Conrad Cole, an aspiring graduate senator, was not chosen because of “conduct issues with the university.” Cole was not selected because he will not be taking classes this summer. An earlier version of a story that ran in Tuesday’s paper incor-rectly stated the name of a bat as New Gregorian instead of New Georgian Monkey-Faced bat. It also stated the bat was found in Papua New Guinea instead of the Solomon Islands.WHAT’S HAPPENING

Two men facing long prison 
stays in I-95 robberies 
FORT PIERCE — Two men 
are facing lengthy federal prison 
sentences after pleading guilty to committing a string of armed robberies along Interstate 95.
Yubran Alvarez Vasquez of 
Bluffton, South Carolina, and Matthew Emmanuel Vasquez of Savannah, Georgia, admitted last week they used a ﬁ  rearm in furtherance of a violent crime. That charge carries a minimum 35-year prison sentence up to a maximum of life.
Authorities said the pair tar-
geted gas stations and hotels along I-95 from Melbourne to Ju-piter. In February 2013, they went on a ﬁ  ve-hour spree in which they robbed two gas stations and two hotels at gunpoint.
One man ﬁ  red his gun during 
a robbery at a Holiday Inn Ex-press in Vero Beach, but no one was injured.
Sentencing is set Aug. 27 in 
Fort Pierce.

A Gainesville man was arrested 
after resisting arrest when police 
found cocaine in his pocket.Officers arrested 35-year-old 
Anthony Williams  Saturday on charges of cocaine possession and resisting arrest without violence, according to a Gainesville Police report. 
Just before 8 p.m., a black male 
was reported to be harassing cus-tomers and talking about having “coke” at the Kangaroo Express gas station, located at 14355 W. New-berry Road, according to the report. 
An officer arrived and ap-
proached Williams who said he was attempting to get a ride to Jackson-ville, according to the report. After being asked if he had any drugs or weapons, Williams said he did not have anything on him. He allowed the officer to search him. 
The officer felt several objects 
in Williams’ right front pocket and pulled them out at the officer’s re-quest. When the officer tried to stop Williams from repocketing a plastic wrapper, Williams pulled away.
After a few steps, Williams turned around and raised both arms in a boxing stance.  The officer used his stun gun as Williams began to flee toward the store, according to the report. Half a gram of cocaine was found in the plastic wrapper. 
Williams was booked in the Ala-
chua County Jail just after midnight. At press time, his bond is $7,000.

Gators of any major hoping to 
enter the literary world can breathe 
easy — an English degree is not re-quired. 
UF alumni have published 161 
books through 103 publishers, Padgett Powell, a UF English profes-sor, wrote in an email. 
One such author recently pub-
lished his first novel. Marc Weingar-ten graduated from UF in 1973 with a bachelor’s in political science.
“I really put that to good use,” 
the 62-year-old comedian and au-thor said.He had originally set out to be a 
lawyer, but after attending a semes-ter of law school, he found that he did not enjoy it.
“I didn’t want to make money off 
of other people’s problems,” he said. “I wanted to make money off of my own creativity.”
Weingarten’s first novel, “Cape Comedy,” was published April 16 after 18 years of writing.
Even though Weingarten did not 
enter a field using his degree from UF, he said there is no such thing as a waste of experience, which he said  laid the groundwork for his book.
Nikolas Wong, another Gator 
author and current UF student, also finds material from his experiences.
The 22-year-old criminology se-
nior just had his second work, “Sum-mertime Treasure,” published.
The short poem is based on a true 
story about a trip to the beach with a friend.
“The stories are like a ‘thank you’ 
to my friends,” he said.
UF writers find publishers, success outside their degreesMay 29, 1974
The Gainesville Eight, a group of anti-war protesters in-
cluding members of Vietnam Veterans Against the War, filed 
suit in federal court alleging their civil rights were violated by prosecutors and local FBI agents. The year before, they were on trial for a conspiracy to disrupt the Republican National Convention in 1972.

The home of the Gators was overrun with alligators leav-
ing its lakes to look for love. UF zoologist Kent Vliet called 
increased gator sightings on campus seasonal habits. Once young gators grow to about 3 feet, the adults chase them off to protect the even younger, smaller gators. “That’s a tough time for gators,” Vliet said. “They can’t survive in the big lakes because the males will kill them.”

“Alice’s Friends” came together to defeat plans to build stu-
dent housing near Lake Alice. “You stick hundreds of people 
living across the street from Lake Alice,” group organizer Ary Lamme said, “and the Lake Alice experience goes down the tubes.” Besides destroying the park feeling of the area, alliga-tors were another issue.

“Dirty Mike” cleared his 
throat and then grunted into the 
microphone. 
“The word ‘clitoris’ comes 
from the greek word meaning…”
“Not  real!” shouted Gainesville 
resident F. Mark Covert, 37, from the back of the bar. 
Covert and his friends sat 
around a small table at Dirty Bar on Northwest 43rd Street Wednesday night, arguing over answers to Kinky Quizzo, the bar’s weekly adult trivia game. 
They were the “Prison Sex 
Perverts,” up against such dar-ing competitors as “The couch pulls out, but we don’t” and “My grandma can’t wrestle, but you should see her box.” 
After three rounds of 10 ques-
tions on strange animal sex hab-its, X-rated ﬁ  lms and euphemistic expressions, Covert’s team ﬁ  n-ished second, beating about eight other teams. 
Hidden behind The Flying Bis-
cuit Cafe and The Fresh Market in the Thornebrook Village Shop-ping Center, Dirty Bar is home to post-college locals and few un-dergraduate students. 
It is the only bar in Gainesville 
that hosts Kinky Quizzo, a pre-packaged adult trivia game that supplies the questions, answers and prizes to participating bars.     Twelve bars around the U.S. host the game, according to Kinky Quizzo’s website, including Cit-ies Bar in Crystal River, Florida.
“It wasn’t what I expected,” 
said 20-year-old UF chemistry junior Alaina Giacobbe, a last-minute member of the Prison Sex Perverts. Giacobbe said she walked 
away empty-handed, letting her team members keep the vibrator, body paint and a 30-minute sub-scription to hotmovies.com they won. 
“I let them have them,” she 
said of her mid-30s teammates. “They needed them more.”
Giacobbe said the trivia ques-
tions were not nearly as explicit as the table conversation. 
“We went around and told our 
most embarrassing sex stories,” she said.
Covert accidently broke his 
high school girlfriend’s nose dur-ing an especially claustrophobic bout in his car, he said. 
On another occasion, he 
watched an argument lead to his TV smashing to the ground as barbecue chicken wings ﬂ  ew at his face amidst screaming accu-sations of inﬁ  delity.
“I wasn’t cheating,” he said. Dirty Bar’s mumbling emcee 
revealed the answers at the end of each round. 
No, dinosaurs have not been 
found to have both sex organs. Yes, male spiders castrate them-selves during sex to increase sperm transfer. 
And no, “clitoris” does not 
mean “not real.” 
It’s real, and it comes from the 
greek root meaning “climax” or “hill.” 
Giacobbe said although she 
had a good time, she probably won’t go again.
“But I would deﬁ  nitely say go 
once,” she said, “it was an experi-ence.”Local bar offers risque 
trivia, sex toys as prizes

� THE TEEN THOUGHT HE WAS GETTING 
RIPPED OFF.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
SCRANTON, Pa.  — A 16-year-old who believed 
he was being ripped off shot and killed a northeast-
ern Pennsylvania cab driver who refused to take his shortcuts, police said.
Aazis Richardson was charged with murder Fri-
day night, hours after police said he shot 47-year-old Vincent Darbenzio twice in the head. The cab driver’s body was found in his vehicle shortly be-fore 5 a.m. near the entrance to a Scranton housing complex.
“Richardson said he got upset because the cab 
driver was taking the long way and ripping him off,” police wrote in a criminal complaint posted online by The Times-Tribune of Scranton. The com-plaint said Richardson told investigators the driver kept taking a longer route even after being told shortcuts.
Richardson told police he became angry and 
shot Darbenzio after telling him to pull over, ac-cording to the complaint.
While in police custody, Richardson told report-
ers he had killed the driver because he wouldn’t take his preferred route. Asked if being ripped off was reason to kill someone, Richardson replied, “To me, it is.”
Investigators said they traced the cellphone call 
that requested the cab to a home next door to one Richardson frequented. Richardson was arrested af-ter police said they found him hiding in the shared attic. A handgun was also recovered.
The woman who placed the call told police she 
did not know Richardson but called the cab for him because he said he did not have a phone.

stop living in fear?
Yet another mass shooting in the U.S. has left seven 
dead and the country deeply disturbed by the alleged killer’s motives. 
Authorities believe that on Friday, 22-year-old Elliot Rod-
ger stabbed three people in his apartment complex, shot three women — killing two of them — and fatally shot a University of California, Santa Barbara student in a local deli. 
Police have strong evidence against Rodgers. According to 
the Associated Press, he left YouTube videos and a 140-page manifesto detailing his plan to kill his roommates before mur-dering all members of a sorority, as part of a plan to incite a “war on women.”
This shooting is unique in its extra layer of complexity: 
Rodgers is not a man who displayed clear signs of mental illness, according to his parents and peers, and he obtained his weapons legally (neither of these, for example, applied to Sandy Hook shooter Adam Lanza). What sets this horrible incident apart from shootings we’ve experienced in previous years is intent. Rodgers voiced an articulate, singular desire: to hurt as many women as possible. It’s the kind of sobering thought that keeps us awake at night — that somewhere, out there, a man wants to kill you simply because of your sex. 
And while many women in the U.S. aren’t in immediate 
danger of being murdered, the UCSB tragedy was a horrify-ing anomaly. Yet many don’t realize that fear is an everyday part of life as a woman. 
Indeed, fear of male violence dictates many parts of wom-
en’s lives: who she talks to, where she goes and when, what kinds of pocket-sized weapons she should keep handy at all times, if that man she rejected at the bar will follow her home, if she should confront the stranger on the train who put his hand up her skirt when no one was watching.  
The UCSB tragedy and other mass shootings are so ter-
rifying because they remind us that, on some level, we are powerless to protect ourselves from blind hatred. Of course, everyone has the same fear of being hurt — of home inva-sions, of terrorist attacks, of car hijackers and of other random acts of violence that occur every day. 
But women are uniquely impacted by fear of violence 
from others, and we are constantly reminded of our power-lessness. Cars full of men yelling catcalls make us wonder if they will stop to assault us. Slasher ﬂ  icks depicting hot girls being carved up make us wonder who is deriving pleasure from these images. Rodger’s YouTube videos make us won-der which quiet boy in the back of the classroom is harboring resentment toward women. 
In addition to opening conversations about mental health-
care resources and tighter gun laws, we hope that this fresh tragedy will cause everyone — not just lawmakers — to ex-amine the way women presumably owe men sex. As Marga-ret Atwood put it, “Men are afraid women will laugh at them. Women are afraid men will kill them.”
Political correctness hinders truth seeking 
The latest bout of collegiate outrage that has captured 
the nation’s attention surprisingly does not come from an offensive themed fraternity party, or an under-
graduate bellowing “Don’t tase me, bro” during a political speech. No, the country is taking notice that institutions of higher education are sacriﬁ  cing free speech and free expres-sion on the grounds of political correctness. 
Take the recent college commencement speech conun-
drums, for example. 
During the past graduation cycle, many colleges have 
uninvited a good amount of scheduled commencement speakers because of their stances on the Iraq War, Islam and Occupy Wall Street. Those snubbed included former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde, women’s rights activist Ayaan Hirsi Ali and former chancellor at the University of Califor-nia, Berkeley Robert Birgeneau. Yeah, the Berkeley guy was dissuaded from speaking to a liberal university. In effect, col-leges silenced the voices of women, minorities and a liberal administrator — a sign of troubling times in the country.  
One might think, “OK, well those are the speakers’ opin-
ions. Everyone is entitled to his or her opinion.” 
Not the case of these colleges. Toleration, especially in 
the ivy-covered bastions of liberal thought, is a one-way street. Those deemed unenlightened, those who have not progressed on select issues and those who dare to buck the public consensus face incoming trafﬁ  c head-on. 
The all-too-common rationale is, “I will tolerate you pro-
vided you agree with me. If you don’t, I won’t allow you to speak.” 
As a result, students are prevented from participating in 
a learning experience on campus. Students, who ironically have been forcibly proselytized to by many an academic, would listen to the commencement speech and form their own opinion about the topic discussed.  
College educators are not only informing students what to 
think but also what to ﬁ  nd offensive. Some institutions have begun using trigger warnings in order to warn readers of any subjects discussed in the text that are deemed offensive. 
For example, Oberlin College warned students reading “Things Fall Apart” that it may “trigger readers who have expe-rienced racism, colonialism, reli-gious persecution, violence, sui-cide” and more. 
I, for one, have never met a 
person in the waiting room of a psychiatrist who is dealing with problems caused by colonialist references in a book. 
Hysterics aside, a person should be sensitive to others. 
But when sensitivity goes awry, the resulting political cor-rectness becomes farcical.
National Review Online columnist Jonah Goldberg made 
an interesting point. He wrote, “We live in a culture in which it is considered bigotry to question whether women should join combat units — but it is also apparently outrageous to subject women of the same age to realistic books and ﬁ  lms about war without a warning?” Farcical indeed.     
It’s a shame that these situations happen on college cam-
puses. Pursuing higher education is a venerable endeavor, and professors can make a great difference in a student’s life. However, when one’s schooling gets in the way of one’s education, a degree-seeking student is prevented from par-ticipating in the activity for which he or she is taking out loans. Some professors undoubtedly want to become the free speech arbiters of society in order to preserve their precon-ceived and incorrect ideals that an offense-free world is prac-tical.  In a free society, that could never happen. 
A true education allows room for differing opinions. 
Learning should be a communal experience. If an individual desires to change another person’s opinion, allow him to speak and debate him on the issues. That is an educational ideal. Anything short of that is a tyranny of thought.
A real learning experience is taking place while this ca-
lamity ensues. Students are learning that political correctness is running amuck, and college craziness isn’t exclusive to Sat-urday night keggers.

While this is often described as a moment of liberation for the Jewish people after facing a thousand years of European anti-Semitism, which we saw the worst of in the Shoah (Holocaust), for Palestinians 1948 represents a traumatic event that they describe as al-Nakba, or “ca-tastrophe” in Arabic.
May 15 marked the commemoration of 
the Nakba by Palestinians around the world, except it is in Israel, where the “Nakba Law” criminalizes commemoration of this event from both Palestinian and Israeli history.
Palestinian society was forever impacted 
when approximately 720,000 Palestinians were forced into exile by pre-Israel Zionist militias from 1947 to 1948. In fact, the ma-jority of those were exiled before May 15, 1948, when Israel ofﬁ  cially declared itself as a state and the Arab-Israeli War began. It is simply immoral to frame the establishment of Israel in a liberation context in line with anti-colonial struggles of the post war pe-riod in Africa and Asia. How can it be called independence when it is gained by forcibly removing the indigenous population to cre-ate a state where the majority of the citizens are Jewish, and while this forced majority is given a higher status and more rights over the indigenous? 
This is not liberation: It is colonialism. We as Americans should recognize our 
own nation’s history of ethnically cleans-ing the Native Americans and attempting to normalize our erasure of them. We all live on stolen land, whether we would like to admit that or not, and we see the result of our carnage against this land’s indigenous, 
in which Native Americans have been mar-ginalized and forced to live in reservations. Maybe through conscious observance of this tragedy, we would be able to under-stand similar systems of oppression, many of which are still ongoing.
Any person with a conscience must up-
hold United Nations Resolution 194 and the Geneva Convention that guarantees Palestinians their right of return. The largest refugee population in the world, 6.5 million, consists of Palestinians who were exiled in 1948 and their descendants, and that only accounts for those registered by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency. The right of return should not be seen as a barrier to peace but a necessity to provide true reha-bilitation to those who suffer in some of the most horrible conditions in UN camps.  Fur-thermore, the struggle against settler colo-nialism and apartheid didn’t end with South Africa. The same policies of separation exist in the occupied territories and even in what is deemed as Israel proper today in the form of segregated roads and schools, home de-molitions and various other state policies meant for erasure, both of Palestinian peo-ple and their history.
This summer as we reﬂ  ect on tragedies 
facing the global community, let us not for-get to remember Palestinians and the Nakba that is still ongoing.

Settler colonialism in IsraelGuest column

Speaking OutOn Friday night, a gun-
man killed seven peo-ple, including himself, 
when he opened ﬁ  re on a small community near University of California, Santa Barbara. The gunman, believed to be 22-year-old Elliot Rodger, had posted a seven-minute video to YouTube the night before, detailing his plans and motives. 
In his video, Rodger, who is said to have 
a mental illness, said he was a virgin and that he was forced to live a lonely life be-cause girls were never attracted to him. He said that he did not know why girls weren’t attracted to him because he was the “perfect guy” and the “supreme gentleman.” 
His motivation for the premeditated 
murders? “If I can’t have you, girls, I will destroy you.” 
Despite the familiar arguments for strict-
er gun laws and better mental healthcare resources, it still stands that misogyny and male entitlement are what made Rodger think in the ﬁ  rst place that women owe him sex and should be punished for rejecting him.
The sad fact is: This is not the ﬁ  rst time 
a man has killed because he felt entitled to a woman’s body.  In April, Maren San-chez, a 16-year-old girl, was stabbed after she declined a classmate’s “promposal.” A 19-year-old girl was strangled by a relative in New Delhi a few weeks ago when she de-nied his marriage proposal. 
So I have a message to the men of this 
world: Stop buying into this misogynistic way of thinking women owe you some-thing — it’s literally killing people.
If you just rolled your eyes and thought, 
“not all men” — stop right there. If that’s all you can say to this, then you’re part of the problem.Sure, not all men think this 
way, but judging by the crowd reactions, many do. Comments on his video ranged from, “See girls this is what you get for treating nice guys like shit,” to “And I really feel bad for him, rejection is agony.”
Sure, it sucks to get rejected, 
but it sucks more to be killed 
for exercising your right to say “no.” We as a society need to stop encouraging this idea that the “friend zone” exists.
Rodger took the idea to the extreme. 
But it only takes a quick Internet search on forums for pick-up artists or men’s rights activists to show that some men think like him. 
So what does it say about our culture 
that we are so quick to pin this incident on mental illness or gun issues rather than mi-sogyny?
Concepts like male entitlement and the 
patriarchy are hard to discuss, but it’s im-portant that we realize these things lead to hate crimes and violence against women.
So stop defending Rodger. Stop saying 
he was misunderstood or that he only did it because he was mentally ill. Stop saying that Rodger is just one guy and that most guys don’t think like that. My friend said it well when she suggested that men acknowl-edge that violence against women is real, and women constantly live in fear.
Women worry about walking alone at 
night because we’ve heard stories of girls getting kidnapped. We worry about wear-ing revealing clothing and drinking too much because we know people who have been assaulted. And now, we worry about how exactly to reject a man so that he does not kill her.

Vietnam War veteran Abney William, 67, pays his respects to fallen soldiers. The organization Veterans for 
Peace laid 6,782 memorial tombstones on Northwest 8th Avenue.
NATIONAL
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
GOLETA, Calif. — Colorado 
movie theater shooter James Hol-
mes. Sandy Hook school attacker Adam Lanza. And now Elliot Rod-ger.
All were young loners with no 
criminal history who went on shoot-ing sprees, leaving devastated fami-lies in their wake.
Mass murderers tend to have a 
history of pent-up frustration and failures, are socially isolated and vengeful, blaming others for their unhappiness, experts say.
“They all display deluded think-
ing and a lot of rage about feeling so marginalized,” James Garbarino, a professor of psychology at Loy-ola University Chicago, said in an email.
Since mass killings are extremely rare, scholars say there’s no way to predict who has deadly intentions, let alone who will reach a breaking point and take action.
Past violence is a clue, but in Rod-
ger’s case, police did not see him as a threat to himself or others during a welfare check weeks before Friday night’s rampage near the University of California, Santa Barbara that left six victims dead and 13 injured.
Rodger died of an apparent self-
inflicted gunshot wound to the head after a shootout with deputies, end-ing a night of terror in this tight-knit seaside campus community as the semester drew to a close.
Pinpointing a mass killer “is not 
an exact science. We don’t have a foolproof way of predicting” who will turn violent, said Risdon Slate, a professor of criminology at Florida Southern College.Before Rodger stabbed three male 
UCSB students in his apartment and cruised around in his black BMW firing at sorority girls and strangers, he left a trail of YouTube videos and a 140-page manifesto ranting against women and couples and lamenting his lack of a sex life.
In his postings, Rodger, a 22-year-
old community college student and son of a Hollywood director, said he was a lonely and frustrated virgin.
“I’m sexually attracted to girls. 
But girls are not sexually attracted to me. And there’s a major problem with that — a major problem. That’s a problem that I intend to rectify. I in all my magnificence and power, I will not let this fly. It’s an injustice that needs to be dealt with,” Rodger said in one of the videos.
Before the killings, Rodger’s 
mother became alarmed about bi-zarre videos he posted and alerted authorities in April. But Rodger was able to convince deputies that he was not a risk to himself or others — conditions that would have allowed them to take him into custody under California law.
In his writings, Rodger said he 
had seen several therapists through-out his life, but it’s unclear what he was being treated for.
Experts say people with mental 
illness generally are not more vio-lent than the rest of the population.
On Sunday, several security 
guards stood watch outside the apartment building where Rodger lived. 
Memorials sprung up there, out-
side the sorority house where two coeds were shot nearby and at a deli where a male student was shot.
The university planned a memo-
rial Tuesday afternoon at Harder Stadium on the 21,685-student cam-pus to mourn and remember the six who were killed. The day’s classes were canceled.
Garrett Schneider, a 22-year-old 
student studying physical anthro-pology and linguistics, was touched by the tragedy, but he said he won’t view fellow students with more sus-picion because of it.
“I figure people like this are far 
and few between,” he said. “If you read his writing and look at his vid-eos, it’s obvious that he’s far out there.”
Experts say mass murderers are hard to pinpoint, predict � HE BOUGHT SHOES.

Gainesville Police arrested 
a Lake City man for stealing 
shoes, pants and other items totaling $361.50. 
Officers arrested 41-year-
old Robert Abbott Sunday on the charge of grand theft from the J.C. Penney in the Oaks Mall, according to a police re-port. 
At about 4 p.m., Abbott 
took seven pieces of clothing and a wallet totaling $202.53 from the store and went into a fitting room with the items, ac-cording to the report. He then returned the same items as if they were already purchased.  Abbott used the gift card 
he received from the previous return of the eight stolen items to purchase five pairs of shoes totaling $158.97, according to the report.  
Abbott was approached by 
GPD and escorted to the loss prevention office where the 13 items totaling $361.50 were recovered from Abbott’s store bag by a loss prevention wit-ness before the arrival of GPD, according to the report. 
After questioning, Abbott 
said he only took two pairs of pants without paying for them. 
Officers booked Abbott into 
the Alachua County Jail about 6 p.m. on Sunday. He was re-leased Monday at about 12:30 p.m. He was released on his own recognizance. Man arrested for 
fraudulent returns

So you probably think Florida’s NCAA base-
ball regional is a bit difficult for a two-seed, and 
if that’s the case, you’re most certainly right.
Adjusted RPI is one of the many factors the 
NCAA selection committee takes into account when it puts teams in the field of 64, but it is an unbiased and weighted factor.
For instance, instead of 1.0 for a road victory, 
a road win will be valued at 1.3. A home win is 0.7 instead of 1.0, and a neutral site win is 1.0. A home loss counts 1.3 against, and a road loss counts 0.7 against in the adjusted RPI. This adjustment system replaces the prior one that gave teams bonuses for beating higher-ranked teams, and it went into effect in 2013.
The committee is often criticized for relying 
too heavily on RPI, and the weighting was re-cently altered to its current format to appease northern schools that play many of their ear-ly-season games on the road because of poor weather.
This weekend, the Gators will host College 
of Charleston, North Carolina and Long Beach State in the Gainesville regional, respectively the adjusted RPI rankings of those teams are 53, 41 and 29 giving Florida’s regional an average adjusted RPI ranking of 40.7.
That gives Florida the hardest regional of 
any of the national seeds — barely edging out the LSU-hosted Baton Rouge regional’s average adjusted RPI of 42.7 — even though the Gators are the No. 2 national seed and the Tigers hold the No. 8 seed. Besides LSU, Florida and third-seeded Virginia (average regional RPI: 57.3), none of the other national seeds are hosting a regional in which its guests have an average ad-justed RPI of less than 82.3.
UF only hosts one top-40 adjusted RPI team while Louisiana-Lafayette, TCU and Virginia each host two, but Florida does have a North Carolina team that checks in at No. 41 in the RPI rankings, and College of Charleston, who is the fourth seed in the region but ranked No. 52 in adjusted RPI.
Florida’s four-seed is the strongest by a long 
shot out of any of the eight national seeds, and that’s what boosts its regional’s average adjust-ed RPI. Other than LSU’s four-seed Southeast-ern Louisiana (No. 73) no other national seed has a four-seed in its region better than 111th in the adjusted RPI rankings.
Part of the issue the selection committee 
has is pairing teams within a reasonable prox-imity of the national seeds. That explains why No. 4 seed Indiana is hosting Indiana State and Youngstown State among its three guests; those teams have respective RPI rankings of 22 and 270. But Florida State, UF’s blood-rival just a two-hour drive northwest is hosting a regional with an average adjusted RPI of 82.3 and only one school in the adjusted RPI top-50.
For comparative purposes, alligatorSports 
went back to the year 2000 and looked up the adjusted RPI of each team in every two-seed’s regional in the NCAA baseball tournament.
Besides 2001 and 2000, all RPI rankings were 
representative of the time that the NCAA tour-nament selections were made in that particular year. The 2001 and 2000 RPI data is from after those years’ college world series were made.
Florida is the No. 2 seed with the hardest re-
gional in average adjusted RPI by a wide mar-gin over those years with the exception of Van-derbilt’s 2013 Nashville regional (49.3).
In five different years, the regional guest 
average adjusted RPI was in the 50s, 2011’s Gainesville regional (56.3), 2009’s Fullerton re-Gainesville regional historically 
hard for Gators according to RPI

The UF women’s golf team had a 
rollercoaster of a season.
Florida started off its season in early 
September on a high note, placing first 
out of 20 teams at the Cougar Classic in Charleston, S.C. The Gators’ final score was five-under-par, junior Anna Young won the individual portion of the tour-nament and freshmen Karolina Vlckova and Maria Torres finished in the top 15.
That performance would prove to be 
one of UF’s  highest points of the sea-son.
After the first round of Florida’s only 
home tournament, the SunTrust Gator Invitational at the Mark Bostick Golf Course, UF sat in 11th place out of the Women’s golf team falls

Florida State on Feb. 18 at the Ring Tennis Complex.
WOMEN’S TEN NIS
IAN COHEN
Alligator Writer @ibcohen5
Unlike many of Florida’s previ-
ous tennis teams, this season had no 
highly acclaimed All-Americans and no trophies to hoist at the end of May.
But also unlike previous years, the 
future never looked more promising.
Florida’s three seniors — Alexan-
dra Cercone, Soﬁ  e Oyen and Olivia Janowicz — are rightly credited with a majority of this season’s success. The trio led the Gators to a 23-6 season and went undefeated on their home courts at the Ring Tennis Complex.
But the largest takeaway from this 
past season is not Florida’s oldest players, but the youngest.
And their numbers speak volumes.Kourtney Keegan developed into 
one of the nation’s brightest and youngest doubles players, ﬁ  nishing with a team-high 32 doubles wins — nine victories ahead of second-place Janowicz.
Belinda Woolcock also proved her 
worth in doubles, pairing with senior Oyen and advancing to the Round of 16 in the NCAA Doubles Champion-ships.
And lastly, despite limited playing 
time, Stefani Stojic managed to end the season with a perfect 8-0 record in dual match singles.
Does this give hope to next season, 
when Florida will be without gradu-ating seniors Janowicz, Cercone and Oyen?
“Absolutely,” coach Roland Thorn-
qvist said after UF’s loss to UCLA in the NCAA semiﬁ  nals on May 19. “It was clearly a learning thing for (the freshmen), even for Brianna (Morgan). Brianna played (Court) 4 last year when we were here and today she was on the show court.”
Aside from Keegan’s develop-
ment in doubles, Morgan’s jump up to Court 1 in singles could prove to be a big determinant to Florida’s success next season. She will inherit the lead-ership reins from UF’s senior trio as she becomes the team’s oldest player.
Thornqvist thinks the experience 
the sophomore gained this season, while winning 29 of her 37 singles matches, will come in handy.
Florida’s coach also hasn’t shied away from praising Morgan’s skill, athleticism and poise throughout the season.
“Look, when she trains for an ex-
tended period of time, she could be one of the top 3 or 4 players in the country, no question about it,” Thorn-qvist said. “Brianna has beaten the best players in America … so I know it’s in there.”
The sophomore backed up her 
coach’s words when she faced Geor-gia’s Lauren Herring in the NCAA quarterﬁ  nals, beating the nation’s No. 6 singles player on her own court.
Morgan insists that it doesn’t mat-
ter where she plays, only how she plays — and that’s why she’s been so successful.
“I really haven’t found any differ-
ences,” Morgan said. “I try to do the same thing I do whether I’m playing on Court 2, 1, whatever. Just try and stick to the same thing.”
The Gators hope the same thing 
will be good enough next year, as they will undoubtedly rely on Morgan and its three rising sophomores to build on the success of this past season.
Young corps looks to build for next year14-team ﬁ  eld. The Gators shot 
25-over-par on the course they were most familiar with and practiced on multiple times a week. “Everyone who plays golf knows that it can be a humbling game,” second-year coach Emily Glaser had said.
That performance would 
prove to be one of UF’s lowest points of the season.
There were also other high 
and low moments. Among them, Florida failed to ﬁ  nish above third place in any tour-nament following the Cougar Classic.
But in one of its third-place 
ﬁ  nishes, the Gators bounced back after a disappointing per-formance in a Palos Verdes, Calif., competition.
The then-No. 16 Gators 
recorded their lowest tourna-ment score of the season, 858 (-6), at the Allstate Sugar Bowl Intercollegiate Championship. This number marked the ﬁ  fth-lowest tournament total in the history of UF’s women’s golf program.
Most recently, senior Elcin 
Ulu shot a career-low, 18-hole round of 66 (-4) in the ﬁ  nal day of the NCAA Women’s Golf Championship, sending her out on a good note in her last year competing as a Gator.
Staying with the NCAA 
Championship, Florida ﬁ  n-ished tied for 18th place in the ﬁ  eld of 24 teams, which was respectable considering that three players in the ﬁ  ve-man lineup – junior transfer Sarah Schober and freshmen Vlckova and Torres – were playing on the big stage for the ﬁ  rst time.
“The experience they 
gained from this week was in-valuable,” Glaser said after the conclusion of the tournament. Although Florida struggled through a rough-and-tumble season, the future is bright for the young Gators. The team is graduating only one senior, Ulu. Every player on the roster who is expected to return for next season has at least some tournament experience, and some have enjoyed standout moments this year.
UF will continue to be led 
by the up-and-coming Glaser. Over her two years as the head coach at Florida, the Gators improved their ﬁ  nish in the SEC Championship from 13th to a tie for 10th and stayed in the thick of things with NCAA regional and championship play.
When Glaser was hired in 
2012, she described herself as a “grinder” and said she always tries to “ﬁ  nd a way to get it done.”
Florida women’s golf will 
continue to do so, too, no mat-ter how rough the ride may be.gional (55.3), 2005’s Atlanta regional (59.7), 2004’s 
Columbia regional (53.3) and 2002’s Clemson re-gional (59.3).
Every other two-seed had an average adjusted 
RPI of 70 or more among its participants.
Despite its competition, Florida is expected to ad-
vance out of the regional stage, they wouldn’t be so highly seeded if they weren’t, but the numbers show its road is tougher to hoe than most. 
Coach Kevin O’Sullivan told reporters Monday he’s very excited with where his team is after a run to the SEC tournament ﬁ  nals last weekend.
He was most impressed by the way his team re-
sponded to being tired, and not having much to play for Sunday, calling UF’s play “crisp” in the loss to LSU. 
“Right now the only thing I’m worried about is 
our regional to be honest  with you,” O’Sullivan said. “There’s no easy road (to the College World Series). You’ve gotta play good teams.” 
Even if there was an easy road, thanks to its re-
gional draw, Florida certainly wouldn’t be taking it.

No. 12, Richie Martin rounds the bases in the Februrary 14 season-opening game against Maryland. The 
Terripans also reached their conference tournament championship game, falling Georgia Tech.
At least $217,724 worth of Molly intercepted en route from China
Post Ofﬁ  ce. The agent opened the package to 
ﬁ  nd 4.8 pounds of a “white rocky substance,” which after being ﬁ  eld tested was identiﬁ  ed as MDMA.
An inspector then assumed an under-
cover role and hand-delivered the package to Caldwell, who signed for it and took cus-tody of it. An unnamed witness in the report told police that this was not the ﬁ  rst package Caldwell had received from China, and said she had sent money in exchange for Molly in the past.
Molly is similar to the drug ecstasy — both 
are technically MDMA — but Ecstacy is its pill form while Molly is usually a powder or crys-tal-like substance and is sold for about $100 to $130 a gram.
Caldwell was released at 8:31 p.m. May 14, 
on $2,000 bond. and was arraigned ﬁ  ve days later when he entered a plea of not guilty.
In early January, Caldwell was one of eight 
men arrested in an illegal gambling operation by Tampa police. He was charged with run-ning an illegal gambling house and bookmak-ing at the time.
In 2009, he was involved in a domestic vio-
lence case and in 2011, he was booked for pos-session of marijuana as well as driving with a suspended license.
On May 14, he became involved as a co-
defendant in a foreclosure case with his wife Sherron on a property in New Tampa.
His 141 receptions as a Gator was good for 
sixth best all-time when he chose to forgo his redshirt senior season to enter the 2002 NFL draft. He had a streak of 10 consecutive games with a touchdown and his eight career games with 100 or more receiving yards was tied for third in UF history at that time. He was draft-ed 48th overall by the San Diego Chargers and played seven seasons for two other teams — the Washington Redskins and New England Patriots.
His younger brother Bubba also played for 
UF and set a school record for receptions in a career in 2007 with 185.

Kirsti Merritt just wanted to ﬁ  n-
ish it.
After No. 5 seed Florida took a 9-0 
win on Saturday against 12th-seed-
ed Washington in the Gainesville Super Regional, the Gators needed just one win on Sunday to advance to its sixth Women’s College World Series in seven years.
More than 11 hours after the ﬁ  rst 
pitch of the day, UF punched its ticket to Oklahoma City.
Washington won the ﬁ  rst game of 
the day 4-3 at Katie Seashole Pressly Stadium to even the series and force a third-game tiebreaker.
Three innings into the deciding 
matchup, Mother Nature decided to play along, as well.
Two rain delays that totaled ﬁ  ve 
hours and 52 minutes caused a game that started at 3:12 p.m. to not end until 11:03 p.m.
But when the game ﬁ  nally end-
ed, Florida was on top with Merritt sending the ﬁ  nal blow.
The sophomore center ﬁ  elder — 
all 5-foot-4 of her — belted her 11th home run of the season in the bot-tom of the ﬁ  fth to cap the 8-0, run-rule victory for the Gators.
“The way I swing, yeah I guess 
I was trying to end it, but not in my head,” Merritt said. “I always swing pretty big for being such a small per-son.”
Hannah Rogers pitched the com-
plete-game shutout for Florida, al-lowing just one hit while striking out six batters in the process.  The Lake Wales, Fla., senior is now tied with Stephanie Brombacher for second in program history with 38 career solo shutouts.
The Gators (50-12) wasted no time 
taking a lead on the Huskies (37-15). After leadoff hitter Kelsey Stewart singled to Washington shortstop Ali Aguilar to open up the bottom of the ﬁ  rst, junior Briana Little drove her home three at-bats later to give Florida an early 1-0 lead.
The next two innings were score-
less, with each team getting just one runner on base in the third by way of a two-out walk.
Enter rain delay No. 1.Play halted for three hours and 
17 minutes before the fourth inning commenced.
Rogers returned to form when 
play resumed, striking out two bat-ters in the top of the fourth.
Washington pitcher Bryana Walker — who had not given up a hit since Little’s RBI single in the ﬁ  rst —  did not.
The Huskies No. 2 pitcher walked 
Taylor Schwarz and allowed a Kath-lyn Medina two-out single before Stewart blasted a three-run home run to right ﬁ  eld to extend Florida’s lead to 4-0.
Enter rain delay No. 2.Following Stewart’s home run — 
her seventh of the season — lighten-ing lit up the sky and forced another two hour and 35 minute wait.
But when play restarted for the 
third time, it proved to be the charm for Florida.
Stephanie Tofft grounded out to 
end the fourth inning. It was the last out by a UF batter.
In the bottom of the ﬁ  fth, Walker 
walked Haeger and Little to open the frame. Freshman right ﬁ  elder Justine McLean — stepping into the batter’s box for the ﬁ  rst time in the weekend — hit an inﬁ  eld RBI single to score pinch runner Jessica Dami-co, extending UF’s lead to 5-0.
Merritt sealed the game two 
pitches later, sending the ball over the left-ﬁ  eld fence to end Game 3 more than seven and a half hours after it started.
Heading into the series against 
Washington, Florida was 10-0 in the ﬁ  ve Super Regionals it’s hosted since Walton took helm of the program.
“Unfortunately, the win streak 
is over for Super Regionals, but it didn’t have any bearing on this team,” Walton said. “It’s about the two W’s to move on.”

Johnson’s Journal @RagjUF
It’s my show this week at 
alligatorSports because our 
main editor Jonathan Czupryn is at his brother’s graduation. 
I’ll admit, it didn’t seem 
like a good excuse when he told me where he was going to be for the ﬁ  rst time. I’m sure he could watch it online or look at the pictures on Face-book —  let’s be honest, gradu-ations are boring.
But as I sit writing this on 
Memorial Day, his excuse for throwing me into the editorial ﬁ  re couldn’t be more worth-while. 
His brother Nick will grad-
uate from Army, and he may one day be deployed into combat and defend the free-doms we all hold dear. The most impor-tant one to my current situation? Freedom of the press, or in other words: the very reason you’re able to read these words, and the very reason I’m able to write them without fear of government censorship.
Nick and his graduating class are the 
next wave of men and women that need to be celebrated every chance we get, not just yesterday when we made barbeque and hung out with family.
I write about games, and wins and 
losses, but the moment he walks across the 
stage, Nick Czupryn will be a champion.
So as Jonathan sits in New York, I’ll be 
here holding down the fort in the ofﬁ  ce 
this week running around like a chicken with my head cut off — and I couldn’t be happier about it.
Keeping in mind those preparing to serve on Memorial Day
