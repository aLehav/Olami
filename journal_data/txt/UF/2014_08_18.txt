  Aubrey Stolzenbergmoved to Larkspur north of 
San Francisco with his fam-ily in the late 1960s. In a 1991 interview with an Oklahoma newspaper, Williams cred-ited going to a “gestalt” Marin County high school with help-ing him discover comedy as a way to bridge the gap he felt between himself and others.Later, at the College of Marin, theater director James Dunn saw the genius in Williams when the young student riffed on stage one night, bringing classmates to tears of laughter. Dunn waked his wife when he got home. “You will not have believed what I have just seen,” he told her. “This young man is going to be somebody one day.”Williams through the years raised funds and gave schol-arships at the college, and he was a familiar sight riding his bike, running trails, shopping in the supermarkets in Marin. 
“He just loved the Bay Area,” 
Dunn said. “It kept him away from the hurly-burly of Hollywood, and he liked that.”In 1997, Williams gave a San Francisco-styled eulogy to San Francisco Chronicle col-umnist Herb Caen, whose work had memorialized the city’s beauty and characters for decades. .Williams read out loud part of Caen’s own tribute to San Francisco, where newcom-ers glory ‘”in the sights and sounds of a city they sud-denly decided to love instead of leave.’”“I’m sorry you had to leave, man, but you’re still here. See ya,” Williams said then.AP BRIEFS
Officer’s name begins to lift 
weeklong mysteryST. LOUIS — For nearly a week, the police officer who shot and killed an unarmed black teenager in Ferguson, Missouri, has been a shad-owy figure — nameless, face-less and seemingly shielded from the fury that has filled the streets of the town he was sworn to protect.On Friday, the community finally learned his name — Darren Wilson, a 28-year-old white officer who has spent the past six years patrolling the St. Louis suburbs, drawing praise from his boss.Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson provided the name and said Wilson had not been the focus of any public com-plaints. He declined to offer many details about Wilson’s life or career but commended his police record and his de-meanor.“He was a gentle, quiet man,” Jackson said. “He was a dis-tinguished officer. He is, has been, an excellent officer for the police department.”Police said Wilson stopped 18-year-old Michael Brown and another young man last Saturday because they were walking down the middle of the street. He ordered them onto the sidewalk.Authorities say one of the men pushed Wilson into his squad car, then physically assaulted him in the vehicle and struggled with him over the officer’s weapon. At least one shot was fired inside the car before the struggle spilled onto the street, where Wilson shot Brown multiple times, ac-cording to police.Wilson is “devastated” by last weekend’s events, the police chief said.“He never intended for any of this to happen,” Jackson added.The killing touched off day after day of violent protests, which were met by an ag-gressive police response that included officers in riot gear pointing assault rifles, firing rubber bullets and unleash-ing tear gas. On Thursday, the governor ordered Missouri State Police to take over secu-rity in Ferguson. Within hours, the tension in the streets began to ease.Wilson spent the first two years of his career with the police department in nearby Jennings, Missouri, before moving on to Ferguson for the past four years. Ferguson’s police force is nearly all-white. The town’s population is about 70 percent black.Jackson had originally planned to release the name earlier in the week but delayed the an-nouncement, citing safety concerns and death threats against the officer.
St. Louis County police and 
the FBI are conducting sepa-
rate investigations.
The St. Louis County pros-ecutor said it will probably 
be weeks before a decision is 
made on whether to charge 
Wilson with a crime.
Robin Williams: Bay Area 
made him feel normal 
SAN FRANCISCO — Robin 
Williams was everywhere in 
San Francisco, it seemed, as he made a place for himself 
in the everyday fabric of a 
city where he once said he 
passed for normal.
The comedian was there to usher a few fellow inhabit-
ants of the Bay Area into life 
— visiting a pediatric ward, 
unheralded, each year on 
Christmas Day to welcome newborns to the world.
He also ushered friends out 
of life— delivering a boister-
ous eulogy for an iconic lo-cal journalist known as Mr. San Francisco, musing on heaven as a nice bar in the city with a dry martini.In between, Williams had turned out to cheer every-thing from the Giants to the opening of a local pub-lic library. Bay Area people got used to seeing the actor at restaurants and stand-up clubs, even handing out treats to children at his house, with a topiary dino-saur looming in the yard, at Halloween.After word of his appar-ent suicide this week at his home in Marin County, resi-dents who had encountered Williams recalled a comedi-an who didn’t always try to be funny but never failed to be gracious.In 1998, Dr. Carrie Chen and colleagues at the University of California-San Francisco hospital had just deliv-ered a premature baby on Christmas Day. “And then someone knocked at the door 
and said Robin Williams was 
there,” Chen said.
“He looked at this tiny baby, all the tubes and IVs com-ing out of him. And then he 
looked each and every one 
of us in the eye, and person-
ally thanked us for being there on Christmas Day, and for being there for the baby,” 
Chen recalled.
The only child of a well-off 
auto executive, Williams was born in Chicago and

 Heads up, nondrivers. Here’s 
what you still need to know about 
traffic laws.
 
Bicyclists:
· You must obey all the same 
traffic laws as normal motorists, including the speed limit  (which is 20 mph on campus), stopping at stop signs and knowing right-
of-way. 
· You cannot wear headphones 
or anything that would impede 
hearing while riding. Sorry, your morning pick-me-up “Happy” 
jam will have to wait until you 
lock up your bike.
· You should ride in the bike 
lane when possible. If going 
under the speed of traffic, ride 
as close to the right side of the roadway or left side on a one-way street. If the lane isn’t wide enough to maintain a safe dis-
tance between a car and you, you 
may ride in the lane.
· If riding on a sidewalk, you 
must heed right-of-way to pe-
destrians and say when you are 
going to pass by. That’s right, pedestrian, that cyclist was a jerk for almost running you over.
· When riding between sunset 
and sunrise, you must have your-bikes equipped with a white light in the front and red light in the back.
· You get the same fines for 
traffic violations as drivers: $154 for moving violations, $204 for running a red light, $104 for nonmoving violation such as not 
have proper lights, and $52 for 
bike-specific violations.
 
Skateboarders and Rollerbladers:
· Skating, whether on a skate-
board or with inline skates, in the roadway is prohibited, including in the bike lanes. Sorry, skate-boarders, you have to stick to the 
bumpy and crowded sidewalks.
· Skating is prohibited at these 
parts of UF campus: Fine Arts 
Complex, Architecture Building, 
Ben Hill Griffin Stadium, Stephen 
C. O’Connell Center, parking ga-rages, and park and ride lots, ac-cording to UPD’s website.
· Skaters should announce 
when they are passing pedestri-ans and only pass on the left. Or, you know, get off when you’re going through a mob of people 
on Turlington Plaza. Pedestrians:
· Pedestrians have the right 
of way on sidewalks and cross-
walks.
· Pedestrians may only cross 
the street where crosswalks are 
provided and only when traffic 
control signals allow. That means no crossing the street in front of Library West to get to Chipo-tle and your desperately needed 
burrito bowl.
· Pedestrian jaywalking tickets 
are $52.50.

Rules of the road for nondrivers
Hello Gators!
Welcome to the University of Florida! With all the 
improvements taking place across campus, it is a very 
exciting time to begin your journey as a Florida Gator. We are 
on the verge of becoming a top-10 public institution, and our increasingly diverse and accomplished Student Body promises many opportunities for UF students.
It’s an honor to have been elected to 
serve as your Student Body president and to represent all 50,000 students here at UF. Student Government is al-ways finding ways to improve our campus as well as the over-all student experience. The renovation of Newell Hall, which is located in the heart of campus, is only one example of the many great things to come. 
Recently, Student Government successfully lobbied our 
state legislature for $10 million in funding that will turn this building into much needed, innovative study space that will enhance your experience as a Gator. In addition, the J. Wayne Reitz Union is undergoing massive renovation and expansion. This expansion will accommodate the growing interests and in-volvement of our student body and the close to 1,000 student organizations on campus.
Looking back at my time at UF thus far, the best advice I can 
give to any Gator is to make the most of your time here. There is no better way to enhance your UF experience than to immerse yourself into the community you live in. As you acclimate your-self to campus, I encourage you to get involved with something. 
I am hopeful that you will take advantage of all that our univer-
sity has to offer!
If you are interested in Student Government, come visit our 
offices on the third floor of the Reitz Union and learn about all 
we do for the student body. There are many ways to get in-
volved; to learn more, stop by our open house on Sept. 3 from 
11 a.m. to  4 p.m. in the Student Government office. You can also visit our website, sg.ufl.edu, for more information.
In addition, I encourage you to take a look at my blog, stu-
dentbodyprezuf.blogspot.com, and follow me on Twitter and Instagram at @UFSBPrez. I post regularly to inform the Stu-dent Body about the projects we are working on, tips on life in Gainesville, upcoming events, and ways to make your experi-ence on campus the best is can be!
I am looking forward to an exciting upcoming year. I know 
you are going to have an amazing semester, and an incredible journey here at UF. If you ever have any questions about Stu-dent Government or anything going on at UF, always feel free to reach out.
Best of luck, and Go Gators!Welcome from SG

You’ve heard the legend — every time a virgin grad-
uates from our esteemed university, a brick falls down from Century Tower. The tower is still stand-
ing and no bricks have been reported missing, so there must be a lot of sex happening at the good ol’ University 
of Florida.
So, whether this is your first semester on campus, or 
whether you just want a refresher in UF Sex 101, here are 
a few tips for your college sex life:
1. First off, always practice safer sex. You have no ex-
cuse not to use a condom — they are available for free at 
the Student Health Care Center, at the GatorWell hut that travels around campus and at the Planned Parenthood on Northwest 13th Street. Protect yourself and your partner 
against STIs and unplanned pregnancy.
2. UF Student Health also offers free and confidential 
STI testing for patients with no symptoms. They’re dis-
creet, and I can tell you from personal experience that the testing was short and painless, although it does require a urine and blood test. If you’re sexually active, you should get tested at least once a year. The clinic can be reached at 
352-294-7465 to make an appointment. 
3. Twin, extra-long beds suck. It’s like they were in-
vented specifically to make any sleeping position awk-
ward. Spooning is your best bet if you want to sleep. As for sexual positions, go crazy. Just be extra careful if you have a lofted bed — I would recommend avoiding any rolling motions. I, along with my partner, once fell out of my bed while hooking up. Bragging to your friends that your sex was so crazy you fell out of the bed sounds like 
fun, but having a bruise from hitting your dresser is not.
4. If you’re in a room where you have a twin, extra-long 
bed, it means you most likely have a roommate. Plan ac-
cordingly, and set boundaries. If possible, set up a signal — 
even if it’s just a text ahead of time — to tell them you have 
a guest. Be respectful — don’t sexile your roommate every 
night. And if they leave the room for you one night, it’s polite to do the same when they need some privacy. Be mindful of each other’s schedules, too. If they have a big exam and need a good night of sleep, consider go-
ing to your partner’s place instead.
5. Don’t worry about hooking up with people who live 
on your floor or in your dorm. I did it multiple times and 
I’m still alive, dignity intact. If you think that guy in the 
next room over is cute, go for it. Will people talk about 
it? It’s a possibility, yeah. Will they hear you if you moan 
really loud? The walls are thin, so yes. Will they knock on 
your door and offer you a condom, a la Amy Poehler in 
Mean Girls? Probably not, although that has happened to 
me. Don’t be ashamed — sex is natural, healthy and, well, 
fun — although maybe try to keep the noise down.
6. Don’t hook up in dorm showers. First of all, shower 
shoes are not sexy. Second, similar to twin, extra-long 
beds, dormitory showers are designed in such a way that there is no comfortable position. Don’t break your ankle trying to have shower sex — just wait until you have an 
apartment or house.
Plus, other people have to use that shower to, you 
know, get clean. No one wants to shower where his or her roommate has orgasmed.
7. This last tip is cliche, but ultimately the most impor-
tant: Try new things. College is the perfect time to experi-
ment, as long as you’re doing it safely. You’re away from your parents for the first time, you’re surrounded by good-looking students — go Gators — and college is the ultimate time of self-discovery. Have a threesome. Realize that you like girls... and guys. Try new positions, new kinks, even new locations — classroom, anyone? Or if you’re feeling really adventurous, plan a quickie for Century Tower and see for yourself if you can find any missing bricks.

but don’t worry:
You’ll get over it
One night in the middle of October 2011, I called my par-
ents from my late-application triple in Broward Hall. 
Gainesville was a far cry of my sun-drenched South 
Florida home — the pollen in the oak trees ignited my allergies, the swampy humidity made me homesick for coastal breezes 
and my tiny room was not much bigger than a 19th century 
New York City tenement house.
My dad was all about it when I told them I wanted to leave 
UF. Of course you can leave, he said. Of course you can come home. Mom was more firm. Finish the Fall term, she said. We’ll talk about it over Winter Break. 
Sure enough, by December, it’d passed, and Spring was bet-
ter. Every semester, in fact, was better. Now that I only have two left, it’s hard to recall why I ever wanted to leave in the first 
place. 
To its credit, UF does all it can to make sure that you, reader, 
don’t feel lonely. But it’s inevitable — there are only so many 
club meetings you can attend, so many residence hall pre-planned activities, so many fraternities and sororities and study groups. By the middle of your first semester, it hits you: the Uni-versity of Florida is not home. The food in the dining halls is no match for mom’s lasagna. The friends you’ve just met in your classes and on your floor are great, but they just don’t know you 
like your friends back home. Your boyfriend went to Duke; your 
girlfriend went to UC Berkeley. 
You’re lonely. There’s a lot of great advice that your parents and friends and 
RAs can give you when that middle-of-the-semester homesick-ness rises, but the best I can give you is this: Wait. Adjusting to college life is a complete shock to the senses, and it’s OK to feel homesick or caught up in sadness. But it passes with time, as you accumulate friends and experiences (and allergy medications).
The second-best advice I can give you is to talk to someone 
about it.
One of the most liberating moments I had that Fall semes-
ter was when I confided in my new friend Gavin about how I’d called my mom and dad like a big baby. Gavin, who would eventually become my best friend/roommate/Chipotle ride-or-die, said something I’d never even considered: Everyone is lonely, everyone is homesick and everyone is acting as if they aren’t. So don’t be afraid to say something — even if they’re a 
new friend. 
It’ll probably only last the first semester. By the second se-
mester, I’d met and befriended the girl who is now my room-
mate. I joined the staff of the Alligator. I left that tiny corner in Broward Hall. 
It’ll happen for you too, reader, but not right now. For now, 
go to that shaving-cream fight in the Yulee pit. Go to that The-atre Strike Force audition or that rugby practice or that Alligator open house. Talk to those kids on your floor, your lab group, 
your lecture hall. Call your mom or dad or sibling or favorite 
high school teacher. 
Loneliness will find you, sure. But it’ll pass. MONDAY, AUGUST 18, 2014

Cooking pasta in your coffee mak-
er because of a listicle about life hacks 
for college students may not work out so well. In fact, you just might burn down your dorm. Instead, save your-
self the trouble and check out UF’s 
dining halls. 
Fresh Food Company and Gator 
Corner Dining Center are both set up as buffet, all-you-can-eat style dining areas. You pay once and can take as many servings as you’d like. How-ever, when you leave the dining hall, you have to pay again to reenter. 
Fresh Food Company is located 
near Broward Hall. You may recog-nize it from Preview, but you may not be able to recognize the food. Sorry to break it to you, but the food isn’t all that amazing year-round. The best time to eat at Fresh Food Company is during Preview because the food is better on Preview days. 
Gator Corner is located near the 
Tolbert Area dorms. For all you ath-lete groupies, it’s one of the best plac-es to scope out UF’s talent. Springs Residential Complex, which is typi-cally populated with athletes, is close 
to Gator Corner. Don’t be surprised if 
you see extremely tall men waiting to grab their morning cereal with you. 
If you’re a vegan, then ﬁ  nding a 
good meal at the dining halls shouldn’t be a problem. UF was voted as peta2’s Favorite Vegan-Friendly College for a large U.S. school this year.
UF received an “A” on its vegan 
report card and an 84 percent stu-dent satisfaction rate, according to peta2’s website. The school offers at least one vegan entree at every meal and participates in Meatless Mon-days. 
Also, you won’t have to worry 
too much about getting sick of the food because both halls have a dif-
ferent menu every day. They each 
offer themed stations such as the Latin station at Fresh Food Com-pany and the International station at Gator Corner. Both halls also have ice cream and coffee carts for when you need a pick-me-up.

If you’ve decided to decline UF’s meal plan 
and are looking to cook your own meals, you’re in 
luck. Gainesville offers a variety of stores to buy food, including the usual places such as Publix, Winn-Dixie and Target. But before you head to the 
stores you (or your parents) have been shopping 
at for as long as you can remember, take some time to step out of your comfort zone and check out some local stores Gainesville has to offer.
Ward’s Supermarket, located at 515 NW 23rd 
Ave., has been around since 1951 and is a family owned and operated grocery store that provides local produce, meat and other goods. As you make your way to the entrance, you’ll ﬁ  nd beauti-
ful, local plants in front of the store.
Although it takes some time to get to Ward’s 
from campus, and its store isn’t as glamorous as 
Publix, its vast selection of bulk goods, weekly specials and chocolate wall makes the trip worth-while.
Ward’s is open Monday through Saturday 
from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. and Sunday 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.
It’s easy to miss the hidden gem on University 
Avenue that is La Aurora Latin Market. Located 
at 3721 W. University Ave., La Aurora is a bless-ing for anyone in Gainesville looking to make his or her Latin cuisine at home, considering that Gainesville is lacking in the Latin food market in comparison to other cities in Florida.
Here you’ll ﬁ  nd a wide assortment of Cuban 
crackers, as well as tortillas and meat from vari-
ous South American countries. Whether you want 
food items such as beans a certain way – canned or by the bulk – this small market has you covered.
La Aurora is open every day from 9 a.m. to 9 
p.m.
Oriental Food & Gift Market is a bus ride 
away from campus at 3345 SW 34th St. in Uni-versity Towne Center. Oriental Food Market is a one-stop shop for all the Korean cuisine your 
heart desires. If you’re looking for other types of 
Asian cuisine, though, it’s a safe bet that you will ﬁ  nd what you’re looking for here.
Bags of rice as heavy as 40 pounds sit on one 
side of the store, while frozen meals and treats like mochi are found on the opposite side. Ran-dom items imported from Korea or China — chopsticks and rice cookers, just to name a few — are also available.
Oriental Food Market is open Monday 
through Saturday from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. and Sun-day from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.Mix up your local grocery routine

Hanging out on campus doesn’t have to 
be such a dud. By utilizing these activities, 
you’ll realize there’s plenty to do on cam-pus. 
GatorNights
Sure, midtown is a blast, but it doesn’t 
serve free pancakes at midnight. Gator-
Nights does, and all you need is your Gator 1 Card. GatorNights is a program on cam-pus that provides movies, comedy shows, activities and food on Friday nights. Some of the movies shown in the past include “Draft Day,” “Divergent” and “Saving Mr. Banks.” Upperclassmen may tease you for going to GatorNights, but they know they went as freshmen and loved every second of it. To keep up with its Friday night programming, check out GatorNights on Facebook at face-book.com/gatornights. 
Accent Speaker’s Bureau
Every semester, Accent, a student-run or-
ganization, brings speakers to UF to inspire 
and educate the student body. Past speak-ers have included Shaquille O’Neal, the late Maya Angelou and Jonah Peretti, the found-er and CEO of BuzzFeed. The events are free and open to the public. However, when a popular speaker comes to campus, expect to wait in a long line to receive a ticket for the event. For information on upcoming shows, check out Accent on Facebook at facebook.com/accentuﬂ  . Student Government Productions
SGP works to put on concerts every se-
mester with artists such as Florida Georgia 
Line, J. Cole and OneRepublic. SGP also sponsors Gator Growl, so you can thank 
them for a lineup of Ludacris and Foster the 
People. In the past, some concerts have been free and others have cost more than $50. You can ﬁ  nd SGP on Facebook at facebook.com/
UFSGP. 
Reitz Leisure Courses
The Reitz Union offers leisure courses for 
students. These courses aren’t free. How-
ever, student prices are reduced. Accord-
ing to the Reitz’ website, registration for 
leisure classes begins on Aug. 26, and most courses will start on Sept. 15. One popular class is Home Bartending, but you have to 
be at least 21 to take it. If you don’t learn

Interfraternity Council Director of Public Relations

The decision on whether to join a fra-
ternity or not is a very common question 
for college students of all ages. Fraterni-ties and sororities offer an extremely wide range of beneﬁ  ts to interested members 
that allow them to have an easier transi-
tion at the University of Florida. 
The Interfraternity Council (IFC) at 
the University of Florida seeks out to help all of their members in becoming well-rounded students through community service, campus involvement, academic opportunities and lifelong friends.
 With so many members, the students 
in Greek organizations have planted roots in almost every organization on campus. 
Kason Green, a senior and member 
of the student honor and service society, Florida Blue Key, said, “Looking back, I would not have been able to be as in-volved as I am now if it wasn’t for the op-portunities presented to me through my 
Greek organization.” 
Not only do fraternities and sororities 
provide the individual with the means to get involved but they also enable the in-
dividual to give back to the community.  The Greek community has raised hun-dreds of thousands of dollars to beneﬁ  t local and national causes through vari-ous philanthropies and given thousands of community service hours in the last few years alone. 
Last year, members of the Interfrater-
nity Council were able to raise more than  $1 million for charity, contributed more than 25,000 hours of community service and averaged the overall Greek GPA to be higher than the reported all university GPA.
 Greek organizations also offer net-
working options for internships during college and jobs after graduation. Frater-
nities at UF date back as far as 1884. With 
that being said, the alumni network is massive. Alumni recognize the character that Greek organizations build because they too experienced it and are much more willing to hire those who come from the same fraternity or sorority as they do.
 When deciding whether to join or not, 
the answer is very clear. Greek organiza-tions offer many beneﬁ  ts. They provide lifelong friends and mentors, opportuni-ties to get involved and to give back to the community, and great networking opportunities for jobs in and after col-lege. They develop strong character, many great memories, and a great way to leave a lasting, positive legacy at the University of Florida. 
But what makes IFC so unique is that 
their chapters are not simply deﬁ  ned by one speciﬁ  c division. They are not solely a business fraternity, service fraternity, or even an academic fraternity. IFC chap-ters are social fraternities that focus on all areas of business, service, academics and involvement. 
Last Fall, more than 1,400 students 
registered with IFC for recruitment. This 
year, the Interfraternity Council hopes to 
increase that number. IFC Fall Recruit-ment will begin Sunday, Sept. 7 with an orientation and a kickoff barbecue.  
 IFC aims to help students make one 
of the best decisions of their lives. That means empowering them through aca-demics, involvement, social activities, and community service. For more infor-
mation about recruitment, please visit

At the beginning of every school 
year, the Help Desk at the Hub is 
bombarded with students who have all sorts of technology issues.
Richard Lowery, Help Desk 
manager, said the desk is so busy that there is almost no room to sit in the Hub during the ﬁ  rst two weeks of the semester.
The service provides free help 
with GatorLink accounts, email soft-ware, and Internet conﬁ  guration.
Lowery says speciﬁ  c instructions 
for connecting to the Internet are dif-ﬁ  cult to list because they vary from case to case, but UF’s website pro-vides general instructions for get-ting online on a laptop:
The ﬁ  rst time you connect to UF’s 
wireless network, you should con-nect to “uﬁ  nfo,” not “uf,” using your 
GatorLink username and password. 
Do not add “@uﬂ  .edu” to your user-name, and do not use your UFID.
 You may need an ethernet cable 
the ﬁ  rst time if “uﬁ  nfo” is not avail-able. Go to getonline.dhnet.uﬂ  .edu to run XpressConnect software. Se-lect “Auto Conﬁ  guration.” Follow the instructions and select the “UF 
Wireless Service” option. You will have to update any out-
of-date software. You will be able to 
use the Internet only to install up-dates until all of your software is up to date.
The minimum software require-
ments to connect to UF’s wireless 
network are listed online at dhnet.
uﬂ  .edu. You must set Windows Up-dates and Apple Software Update to automatically update. Your com-puter needs to beupdated and run-ning anti-virus and anti-malware software and updated Java, Adobe Flash Player or Adobe Reader soft-ware.
Once your software is up to date, you will be redirected to SafeCon-nect. You must install the Policy Key, which keeps the network safe.
If these steps don’t work, the web-
site encourages students to visit the Help Desk.
Another common issue among 
students is getting into their Gator-Link emails, said UFIT support su-pervisor Kiem Tran. 
“Freshmen are automatically pro-
visioned with an exchange online mailbox now, and that’s hosted on Microsoft Could,” she said. “If you go to webmail.uﬂ  .edu, it’ll show you the link to that new portal.”
However, if students still experi-ence problems, Lowery invites them to contact the Help Desk.
“This is a very overwhelming uni-
versity, and we want to do whatever we can to help them out on our end,” Lowery said.
The Help Desk’s services are free 
for students and available 24/7 ex-cept on some holidays. 
Students may call 352-392-HELP 
or go online at helpdesk.uﬂ  .edu to get step-by-step help from consul-tants.
Students living on campus may 
also contact DHNet, which provides the same services but has locations in 
Beaty East and Hume Hall.

Krishna Lunch is not only a 
staple of UF, but it might be the 
only constant thing in your life 
throughout your years here. 
Served on the Plaza of the 
Americas every weekday from 11 
a.m. to 1 p.m. when UF is in ses-sion by our favorite local Hare Krishnas, the karma-free vegetar-
ian and vegan menu is one of the 
best ways to keep track of your days. 
Spaghetti with tofu and corn 
chips? Must be Wednesday. Kof-ta balls? Tuesday. Bean chili? Is it already Friday? Praise be, the weekend is here. 
Aside from being reliable 
when the rest of your life is fall-ing apart, Krishna Lunch is deli-cious and healthy. The best way 
to diversify your on-campus eat-
ing options is by putting down that spicy chicken sandwich from Chik-fil-A and sitting in the grass 
on the Plaza with a hot plate of 
Krishna. 
The entrees are the same 
based on day of the week. Every Wednesday is spaghetti, every 
Friday is chili. And every day 
you can get a salad with all-natural almond dressing (put some on Wednesday spaghetti 
and get ready for the best nap of 
your life), halva (ethnic, flavorful cream-of-wheat-like dessert), and lemonade or tea. 
Not only is Krishna healthy, 
reliable and delicious, it is also a huge bang for your buck. You can get one buffet-style meal for a do-nation of $5 or 10 meals for $35. Krishna Lunch: cheap, 
reliable, healthy food

opportunities and serve as unique resume builders. Plus, you know, they’re another way to spend your 
time away from Netﬂ  ix. 
Some, like UF TED Club, in which students watch and discuss TED 
Talks, meet once a week. Others, like the UF Liti-Gators Mock Trial Team, meet at least twice a week and often travel around the country competing. 
But if you have the time to devote to

Safety isn’t just a concern of parents with 
their seemingly constant calls. UF has fea-
tures in place to keep you safe on campus.
SNAP, or Student Nighttime Auxiliary 
Patrol, began in 1976 to provide free trans-portation around campus and is monitored by the University Police. Download the app 
and you can request a pick-up and drop-off 
to most campus locations up until 3 a.m. Or you can call 352-392-SNAP to request a ride starting at 6 p.m. in Fall and Spring semes-ters (8:30 in Summer).
Emergency Blue Light phones are scat-
tered across campus and off campus to pro-vide a means of direct alert to UPD. More than 300, non-dial phones are easy to iden-
tify by the large “Emergency” letters and a 
bright blue light attached to the top of the phone. When in use, it will contact UPD’s Dispatch Center and give the dispatcher the precise location of the call. 
TapShield, a mobile application, is UF’s 
app to encourage sharing information between students and police to prevent crimes. The application, with a tap of the ‘Alert’ button, will send your location and 
proﬁ  le information to campus dispatch. A 
‘Yank’ feature is implanted to trigger an alert when headphones are pulled from the device. 
UF Alert is UF’s ofﬁ  cial emergency noti-
ﬁ  cation program to provide alerts through various social media outlets. You can sign up for this service by accessing ‘My UFL,’ under the ‘My Account’ menu, select ‘Up-
date Emergency Contact,’ scroll down and 
select your UF Alert preference. If a large emergency arises, a system-wide UF Alert will be pushed. 
UF’s Naval Reserve Ofﬁ  cers Training

between 7 and 10 p.m. by calling 352-577-

“Free food forever!” you think to 
yourself, after Mom lovingly signs 
away her savings so you can eat un-
limited Gator Dining meals at any time of night. 
That’s very nice of her, but be 
warned: The “Freshman 15” is not a myth. 
Thankfully, you can easily keep it 
off by going to ﬁ  tness classes, play-ing sports or running stadiums. UF 
offers a variety of free group ﬁ  tness 
classes each week, as well as small group classes and personal trainers 
at both Student Recreation and Fit-
ness center, located just east of the stadium, or Southwest Recreation 
Center on Hull Road, across from 
the Samuel P. Harn Museum of Art.
Both gyms have strength and 
conditioning rooms and cardio ar-eas, and second-ﬂ  oor Southwest boasts a 1/9-mile indoor track loop 
for rainy-day runs. 
Running around campus is al-
ways a good option, too. If you ever feel unsafe, ﬁ  nd one of the blue safe-
ty lights located in various places around campus and press the button 
to make a direct call to the police. 
Cool off in the Broward Pool or 
do some serious swimming along-side Gator athletes in the Stephen C. 
O’Connell Center pool. 
Not into working out alone? Play 
pick-up basketball at the Broward Outdoor Recreational Complex, or sign up for an intramural sport as 
a free agent or with a team on im-
leagues.com. Join anything from soccer to indoor table tennis to kick-
ball. And if you’re really ambitious, 
try out for a club team.
Relax with your friends at Lake 
Wauburg, located 8 miles south of campus on Highway 441, where you can borrow kayaks, canoes, paddle 
boards and more. The two-entrance 
park is just for university students — so bring your Gator 1 Card — and offers a rock wall, volleyball courts 
and a full-team ropes course. 
One of the beneﬁ  ts of going to 
a sports-centric school is the abun-dance of facilities generously fund-

Every semester rings in the options of 
buying, renting, selling or borrowing text-
books for class. Sometimes, buying text-
books online is cheaper than buying them in 
person. Here are some online stores to save 
money on textbooks.
Amazon.com 
With possibly the largest selection of 
books available, Amazon has the reputation of being trustworthy and being the most 
used website. Search by author, ISBN or title 
to ﬁ  nd the availability and pricing of your book. Amazon sometimes even allows you to sell your used books back in return for an 
Amazon gift card. 
Chegg  
This website provides the same search 
functions as Amazon, but sometimes has 
books that are unavailable through other 
sources. Chegg gives its buyers options to not just buy a book but to purchase an eText-
book or rent the book for a cheaper price. 
Half.com
This website is a subdivision of eBay that 
caters more toward book sales. Half.com 
presents options to buy or rent books, but it ups the ante by allowing the user to sell much more than just books. Music, movies and games can all be sold with no listing 
charges. Florida Bookstore/Neebo 
With the partnership between the Florida 
Bookstore and Neebo, this service is the clos-
est to campus other than the UF Bookstore. The website allows the user to search for 
books and pick them up in the store, located 
at 1614 W. University Ave. Renting books is easiest here because drop-off is usually done just outside the store during peak times. So while shipping your used books is an option 
here, you can just walk over to the store and 
drop them off. Alternatives to UF Bookstore: where to buy, rent books online

Just because Library West is 
the go-to study spot for many UF 
students doesn’t mean you have to join the masses. If you’re look-ing for a spot to kill time between 
classes, or you’ve gotten sick of 
studying in the same place, there are plenty of other options around campus.
Pugh Hall
Pugh Hall, where you picked 
classes during Preview, is usually 
quiet. It has tables, rocking chairs 
and couches, as well as “pods” 
with padded benches and electri-cal outlets. There’s also a P.O.D. Market downstairs for when you need a snack. Careful, though — 
the benches look tempting to sleep 
on, but signs warn that students found sleeping will be asked to leave. 
Smathers Library
Smathers Library, found off the 
Plaza of the Americas to the right 
of Library West, is a good option for those who need absolute si-lence to study. Booths seat two people, so you can bring a (quiet) study buddy. But, there is only one row of booths, so get there early.
Reitz Union
The Reitz Union, another popu-
lar option, has something that a lot of other places don’t have much 
of: diversity. There’s a quiet area on the first floor with couches and tables, a noisy food court with ta-bles and booths, a few couches in the usually calm UF Bookstore and a bunch of booths on the ground floor near the P.O.D. Market. Plus, if you finish that paper, you can 
head to the free printing lab down-
stairs. 
Architecture & Fine Arts Library
This library, located near Little 
Hall on the second floor of Fine 
Arts Building A, has some unusual features. In the middle stand sev-eral two-level cubbies reminiscent 
of bunk beds, with huge desks, 
cushioned benches and walls for privacy. Tables and computer sta-tions are also available.
Ben Hill Griffin Stadium
Some people like to watch foot-
ball in the stadium. Some like to 
study there. Few people probably 
study at the stadium toward the be-
ginning of the semester because of the weather, but once it improves, it might be worth checking out.
Marston Science Library
This library, near the Hub, isn’t 
as quiet as some of the other librar-
ies. It has big tables for those who 
like to spread out or come with 
groups. It also has computers and some science textbooks available for a two-hour checkout. It’s con-venient for online classes that re-quire expensive books.

You’re 18, your parents just 
bought you a hot new ride and you 
know you’re about to be the cool freshman with a car. 
But while cruising on campus, 
you run into signs demanding 
parking decals and threatening 
stiff fines — or worse, towing. 
The biggest rule to remember 
about parking on campus is tim-
ing. All rules and regulations on 
who can park where are null and void by 5:30 p.m. on weekdays and nonexistent on weekends. 
Keep in mind that this doesn’t 
guarantee a spot. When campus activities start up (campus gets in-credibly packed on gamedays and Saturday nights), finding a spot 
becomes a needle-in-a-haystack 
situation.
For off-campus students, park-
ing depends on where you live. 
Apartment buildings usually have 
designated spots for tenants, and 
houses have their accompanying 
driveways. (See story below)
Commuting to campus is an-
other story. Decals are required un-
less you want to park in midtown 
by some of the local restaurants 
— where there’s a good chance of getting towed — or at any father 
parking lot and bike to campus.
The Reitz Union parking garage 
offers pay-for-time parking spots 
that range from 45 minutes for $1, 
2 hours for $3 and all-day parking for $5. Be warned: The 2-hour and 
all-day spots are almost always 
filled during the Fall semesters, 
so don’t bank on them being there 
when you pull in.
My advice: The decal is worth 
every penny you will save on parking tickets. The fines start at 
$30 and go up by $5 increments 
until the fifth offense, which nets you a vehicle impoundment. Ten 
tickets and your campus parking 
privileges are axed for the whole 
semester.
And for those students who 
are staying in residence halls who 
don’t want to leave their sweet 
Mazda 2 that totally doesn’t smell 
like old McDonalds at home, on-
campus parking decals, priced at $77 per semester, give you park-
ing privileges in designated lots 
around campus.
Parking on campus is dicey. 
Without the proper decals or luck, you can quickly find yourself swimming in parking tickets.
Be smart and remember: It’s not 
worth the risk. Parking on campus is a trial-and-error rush to find a space
KRISTAN WIGGINS
Alligator Staff Writer kwiggins@alligator.org
So, you’ve figured out campus parking 
can be a hassle. Now learn the intricacies of 
parking, and its consequences, off campus.
When parking off campus, one thing to 
keep in mind is to stay aware of your sur-roundings. Check for signs indicating times and decal requirement. Last thing you want is to park on the street to go to a house party only to come back to an empty space. 
Most residential zones around campus 
require a parking decal, which are $50 to $100 per year. These are usually given out by your apartment complex, but they can be purchased from the city directly.
When it comes to parking at a friend’s 
complex, make sure to ask them if you need a parking pass to park in the guest parking (if you can find space that is). Sometimes it’s as simple as them writing a note for you to leave on your dash.
There is also metered parking along some 
of the main roads such as West University Avenue and off of Main Street, which costs 25 cents to 50 cents per hour. 
Parking in one of the lots around town is the safest bet to remembering where your car is and not getting towed for illegal park-ing.
When parking goes wrong, there are two 
types of parking you’ll have to deal with.
Normal towing is when a property own-
er sees an illegally parked car, calls the tow company and has the car removed. 
The other type of towing is called roam 
towing. This is the kind that will frustrate you. If there is a sign posted that says roam towing, that means the property owner has contracted the towing company to allow the tow truck drivers to look around for illegal-ly parked cars, which can then tow the car without contacted the property owner. 
The fee to recover a towed car was recent-
ly changed from $76 to $100. Both this and the practice of roam towing is hotly debated in City Commission. UF Student Body Presi-dent Cory Yeffet voiced his concerns when the resolution passed, especially consider-ing the predatory nature of roam towing.
““The students definitely feel that $76 is 
pretty high as is,” he said, according to Alli-gator archives. “Especially compared to the cost of getting your car towed regularly if it breaks down.”
Parking off campus has its own issues, especially roam towing

When you’re in the Southeastern 
Conference, nothing beats Satur-
days in the Swamp and tailgating, but for students new to UF, what you don’t know can hurt you. 
If you fell asleep at Preview, or 
just didn’t pay attention, now is your chance to learn about some of the laws here on campus when it comes to tailgating. 
UPD Lt. Alton McDilda talked 
with the Alligator about some of the things UF students of all ages should keep in mind this football 
season. “Starting at 6 a.m., tailgating can 
begin and it needs to be within the designated areas,” he said. 
Some of the popular designat-
ed areas to tailgate are: Norman 
Hall, Broward Hall, the Stephen C. O’Connell Center, in front of Ben Hill Griffin Stadium, along Muse-um Road and around the Plaza of the Americas. 
So that means that starting at 
6 a.m., tailgaters and students can start setting up their tailgating spots, and people who are at least 21 can start drinking. 
If you’re under 21, here are some 
of the things to be aware of if you plan to drink on campus: It’s a mis-demeanor offense. 
You could be arrested at the 
scene, but you will most likely get a notice to appear in court. 
Depending on the judge, you 
could face community service, fines or even jail time. 
Students caught drinking may 
also have to appear in front of a Student Conduct Committee that’s under the Dean of Students Office 
at UF. 
But McDilda said, “If a student 
goes (to the courthouse) and pleads 
no contest or guilty, it’s usually just a fine.”
But for students and tailgaters 
who are 21 and older, there really isn’t too much to worry about. 
McDilda said that they should 
just be aware that you cannot leave your tailgating area with an open container. 
“We don’t want the appearance 
of everyone drinking all over cam-pus,” he said. “Where it becomes a problem is when people try open containers of alcohol on the thor-oughfares and sidewalks.” 
Anyone caught leaving the tail-
gating area with an open container could be asked to pour the drink out, or could be given a warning. When warnings are issued, officers take down the person’s name and keep track of how many drink-ing offenses he or she has. Repeat offenders could be banned from 
drinking on campus. 
However, McDilda said that it 
needs to be made clear that that’s 
UPD’s policy. 
“When you’re on campus there’s 
one process, and when you’re in the city there’s a different process,” he said. 
So be mindful of where you are 
when tailgating. Some of the tail-gating areas, like the Stephen C. O’Connell Center, are right next to city roads. McDilda said if people are found walking on city property with an open container, they may be issued a civil citation.

It’s about 2:30 a.m., you’re out on the town 
and you have a good buzz goin’. If there is 
any wisdom I can impart to you at this exact moment, freshly picked Gators, it’s: “DON’T FORGET THE LATER GATOR!” 
OK, I’m good now. But for real, guys and 
gals, one of the quickest ways to get sober is an hourlong walk home after a great night. Take 
it from me, you don’t want that. 
If you are new to UF, let me be the first to 
tell you about one of the greatest night services 
we have here — the notoriously dubbed Later Gator.
The Later Gator is a Wednesday-through-
Saturday-night bus system, provided by Gainesville’s Regional Transit System, that transports riders safely to and from down-town, campus and beyond. And because it’s meant to prevent drunk driving, you don’t have to show your Gator 1 Card. There are five routes — A, B, C, D and F — and each route has its own starting and stopping times. So be 
sure to familiarize yourself with the schedule 
and download the mobile apps: TransLoc or TransLoc Rider. The apps use GPS locators that allow you to track your ride down to the minute and even see how full the bus is.
Now that the information session is out of 
the way, let’s get down to brass tacks.
Traditions die hard, and at UF there’s this 
crazy thing called the Later Gator Flip that 
seems to have stuck stronger than cheese on 
a skillet. UF students, typically inebriated, will grab the handrails, pick up their feet and twirl backward while the bus is moving. As fun as it is to hear the whole bus chanting “Later Gator backflip,” I think it’s important for you all to know that no crime goes unpunished. 
RTS spokesman Chip Skinner wrote in 
an email that anyone caught performing this stunt “can be removed from the bus or tres-passed from the bus for up to a year.”
That is just not worth it, y’all. Be mature and just obey the rules. 
“People should also refrain from taking 
pictures of the bus operator or engaging them in conversation while they are driving,” Skin-ner wrote. “This is for our operator and pas-sengers safety.”
For more information, Skinner said he en-
courages everyone to check out RTS’s “Rules of the Road” video on its Facebook page. 
Alas, here are some parting tips on this 
week before the Fall semester starts: Don’t be the person to get so drunk they pass out or vomit on the bus. If it’s after dark, make sure you stand out to the bus drivers. If they don’t see you, you’re walking. And most important-ly, don’t be afraid to talk to the person sitting 
next to you. That’s what college is all about: 
making connections. 
Be safe and smart: Later Gator traditions die hard, good or bad
“People should also refrain from 
taking pictures of the bus operator 
or engaging them in conversation 
while they are driving.”

Whether you’re already think-
ing about healthy eating to avoid 
the freshman 15, there is one meal that will make its way into your diet no matter how hard you try: 
pizza. Gainesville has both mouth-
watering pizza and good-enough-because-I’m-drunk pizza, and these places are worth checking out once you decide to wander from campus dining.
Leonardo’s Pizza by the Slice
Leonardo’s Pizza, located at 1245 
W. University Ave., will probably be your first local pizza experience because of its close proximity to campus.
Leonardo’s offers “thin pies” and 
“thick pies,” as well as toppings that range from pepperoni to tempeh and tofu. Calzones, pasta and salads are also on the menu and my personal favorite: rolls that come with garlic butter and marinara dipping sauce. Living the vegan or gluten-free life? Leonardo’s has your back with its 
vegan and gluten-free options.
If you’re looking for a hipster 
vibe while splitting a pie with your 
roommates, walk to Leonardo’s. Just don’t expect a warm, friendly smile from the cashiers.
Leonardo’s is open daily from 11 
a.m. to 10 p.m.
Satchel’s Pizza
At 1800 NE 23rd Ave., Satchel’s 
isn’t close to campus but everyone makes the trek out there because it is worth visiting for both the food and the atmosphere. Plus, Satchel’s 
was recently listed as one of the “18 
Pizza Joints You Must Try Before You Die” by BuzzFeed.Besides pizza, calzones and sal-
ads, Satchel’s also features home-made sodas made by owner Satchel Raye. With funky decor, a vintage Volkswagen Bus you can eat in and a dessert menu in a View-Master, this is a good place to take your fam-ily from out of town, or better yet, a 
first date.
A couple of things to keep in 
mind: Satchel’s is cash-only. An 
ATM is available in Lightnin’ Sal-vage, which doubles as a junk store and performance venue, and ATM fees go toward charities. Also, ex-pect waits on most nights.
Satchel’s is open Tuesday through 
Saturday from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m.
Italian Gator Pizza
After a night of raging in Mid-
town, you will be drunk, and you will be starving. This is where Mid-town’s hole-in-the-wall pizzeria, Italian Gator Pizza, comes in.
Italian Gator, squeezed between 
Envy and Jimmy Johns on Universi-ty Avenue, (1728 W. University Ave. if you want to get technical) is where you go to get a greasy New York-style thin crust pizza on a paper plate. Toppings are pretty standard, ranging from pepperoni to veggies to meats.
“Where do I sit?” you might ask 
yourself. You don’t. Like I said, it’s literally a hole in the wall, and you’ll need to move quickly in order to avoid being bumped into and drop-ping your pizza on the sidewalk, es-pecially if you’re so drunk, you can barely stand straight.
Remember to enjoy this pizza 
sober as well. Italian Gator is open Monday - Friday from 11 a.m. to 2:30 a.m. and Saturday from 5 p.m. to 2:30 a.m.Big Lou’s NY Style Pizzeria
If you find yourself exploring 
downtown, stop by Big Lou’s NY Style Pizzeria, located at 5 SE Sec-ond Ave. Big Lou’s also offers New York-style thin-crust pizza but feels 
homey in its indoor seating and has 
a view of downtown with its out-door seating.Appetizers range from deli-
cious garlic rolls, which I personally recommend, to mozzarella sticks 
to salads. It also offers calzones, 
stromboli, subs and pasta, as well as a kids’ menu, making it a family-friendly joint.
Overall, the prices are good if 
you’re not looking to spend too much money, especially with its daily specials. Gluten-free and veg-an students are also welcomed.
Big Lou’s is open Monday 
through Thursday from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m., Friday from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m., Saturday from noon to 11 p.m. and Sunday from noon to 9 p.m.A Gainesville guide to life’s most important food: pizza

UF is home to more than 150 pieces of 
public art throughout the buildings and halls 
on campus, so it’s safe to say Gators take art 
seriously. 
During Fall and Spring semesters, the 
College of the Arts hosts numerous art ex-
hibitions in its three galleries — the Focus 
Gallery in Fine Arts C; the Grinter Gallery 
in Grinter Hall and the University Gallery in Fine Arts B — with special receptions so stu-dents can meet artists from around the world and maybe even see some work from your 
classmates. 
“High quality, thought-provoking exhibi-
tions are presented every four to eight weeks 
that engage the university and wider com-munity in stimulating dialogue facilitated by contemporary visual language and culture,” 
according to the College of the Arts website.
Most of the art exhibitions have an open-
ing reception where the artist, whose work 
is on display, will have a Q-and-A session or be available to meet and ask questions face 
to face. 
     This is a great place to take a date, show friends and family or even go solo.
The University Gallery is open Tuesday, 
Wednesday and Friday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m, Thursday from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m., and Satur-day from 12 to 4 p.m. It is closed Sunday, Monday and on holidays.

ty, Focus or Grinter galleries, visit the College of the Arts website at arts.ufl.edu/galleries.  Check out one of UF’s best-kept secrets: University GalleriesNEW STUDENT EDITION

Desired destinations to drop a deuce
Class ends in ﬁ  ve minutes. You cross your legs under a creaky 
lap desk in Turlington. A bead of sweat rolls down your fore-
head: Your bladder is about to explode.
But the Turlington bathrooms? They’re dark and small. That 
building is almost ancient — so many people have used those toilets. And everyone huddles around the stalls and sinks wait-ing for you to ﬁ  nish. You know because you can see them in the crack between the door and the stall.
 On a campus so big, there exists the perfect bathroom for you.  
In the Alligator, this guide exists to help you ﬁ  nd your perfect place to poop.
The three sacred guidelines that apply to all bathrooms on cam-
pus are: 
1. Be forever thankful for the hard-working people who 
keep these bathrooms clean and functioning.
2. The higher the ﬂ  oor, the cleaner the bathroom.
3. The newer the building, the better the bathroom.Hough Graduate School of Business
As some of the newest bathrooms on campus, these are 
also some of the most pristine. The bathrooms are almost 
so nice that you feel bad for using them, especially because they are tucked into a very low-trafﬁ  c area. The lightning is bright, the air conditioning is cold and the amenities are all automatic. And the smell? That bathroom actually smells fresh.
Matherly Hall
If you tried to pick up girls by the bathrooms in high 
school, you can ditch that dream if you have classes in Matherly (you should probably stop doing that anyway): The men’s and women’s restrooms are separated by a hallway of classrooms or two ﬂ  ights of stairs. Men have it lucky here, because they don’t have to run up stairs, shak-ing their bladders, or fast-walk down hallways to peace-fully pee.
But it’s not like these bathrooms are even worth run-
ning to. Matherly was built in 1953, and these bathrooms deﬁ  nitely reﬂ  ect their age. Dim lighting in the bathrooms without windows, humidity at odd times and mildly cramped spaces all make the layout of these restrooms a deterrent.Smathers Library
Smathers, one of the oldest buildings on campus, has one 
of the nicest bathrooms. Located on the ﬁ  rst ﬂ  oor at the end of the study area, the amenities are newer and modern even though the building was built in 1925. The toilets even have water-saving ﬂ  ush options. Afternoon sunlight almost glit-ters through the high windows in this bathroom during the Fall right around midterms, and the stalls are roomy and always clean.  
Little Hall
If you ever want to feel even more awkward and uncom-
fortable while taking a s**t, go to Little. The bathrooms on the ﬁ  rst ﬂ  oor have one stall and a sink, but the design allows for a person to stand inside the bathroom while you are in 
the one stall. If you could lock the main door, this would be 
the perfect pooping paradise because of its privacy, but in-
stead you’ll ﬁ  nd yourself avoiding eye contact with this hor-rible person who made the mistake of waiting between the sink and the stall for you to ﬁ  nish your business.

When it comes to buying beer after turning 
21, cheap beer is deﬁ  nitely the most desired 
option as a broke college student.
Bud Light and Natural Light are familiar 
and comforting, but if you’re thinking about 
breaking out of your comfort zone and switch-
ing to craft beer, Gainesville is one of the best cities to do it because it is home to some of the best microbreweries in the country.
Swamp Head BrewerySwamp Head Brewery, located at 3140 SW 
42nd Way, a Gainesville classic since 2008, was founded upon the idea of being “Inherently 
Floridian,” according to Swamp Head’s web-
site. Brandon Nappy, 33, the brewery’s tactical marketing manager and co-founder, said craft beer is made with better quality and has more variety than what larger breweries offer.
“There are a ton of different ﬂ  avors in craft 
beer, so whether (students are) into the sweet-er or the roastier ﬂ  avors, or the hoppier and aromatic ﬂ  avors of a hoppy beer, they can ﬁ  nd 
something that they’re into,” Nappy said.
Swamp Head offers ﬁ  ve year-round beers: 
Wild Night, a honey cream ale; Cottonmouth, 
a Belgian witbier (brewed with mostly wheat malt); Stump Knocker, a pale ale; Midnight Oil, an oatmeal coffee stout; and Big Nose IPA, an India Pale Ale, according to the web-site. Along with these staples, the brewery constantly offers small releases of new beer, which are often announced on the brewery’s Facebook page.
For those who have never tried a Swamp 
Head beer before, Nappy suggests starting 
light.
“The closest beer that we do to a traditional 
American lager is our Wild Night honey cream 
ale,” he said. “It’s light in color. It’s not going to be extremely intense or have any strong ﬂ  a-vors like some of our other craft beers, and it’s brewed with Florida honey that is harvested in the panhandle of Florida, so it’s a local beer 
brewed with local honey.”
The brewery is in the process of building a 
new location, near AMF Alley Katz Corner on 
Southwest 42nd Avenue, which is expected to be completed in December.
Tall Paul’s Brew HouseAmid the glitz of downtown is Tall Paul’s 
Brew House, on 10 SE Second Ave., home to 
Alligator Brewing.Deeply seeded in Gainesville culture, the 
brewery offers three house brews: Squirrel 
Wrangler, a nut brown ale; White Widow, a Belgian wit; and Devil’s Millhopper, an IPA, according to the Alligator Brewing website. 
The brewery also offers three seasonal house 
brews and several ever-changing special re-leases.
With a giant American ﬂ  ag hanging from 
the ceiling and free arcade games, the brew-ery provides a relaxed atmosphere among the stufﬁ  ness of downtown Gainesville.
Tall Paul’s Brew House also contains a full 
liquor bar, which is ideal if your friends aren’t as interested in craft beer as you are. After 9 p.m., there is a $5 cover.
Tipple’s BrewsIf you’re not in the mood to go out in the 
world, and you want to drink a craft beer in the comfort of your own home, Tipple’s Brews, located at 2440 SW 76th St., is the place to go.
Tipple’s is Disney World for craft beer lov-
ers, serving as a grocery store for all things lo-cal and rare microbrews. The store also has a few taps with a changing menu of local beers on draft, allowing for its patrons to sip beer while shopping.The store also contains a vast selection of 
wine, specialty coffee and cheese, as well as a few specialty sodas and chocolate.
Tipple’s also has a packed event schedule, 
with food trucks parking outside the store 
each Thursday, according to Tipple’s’ web-
site. Food trucks such as Ameraucana Wood Fire, Soup to Nuts and Off The Griddle have stopped at Tipples in the past.
Once your palate has been exposed to 
the depth and variety of craft beer, you will never want to touch a Natty Ice again, and Gainesville provides several options for you to grow.

Swamp Head Brewery sells 32-ounce and gallon-size  growlers for a $4 or $10 ﬁ  ll up. You can also bring your own growler for a ﬁ  ll 
up in either size.

You’ve adopted a puppy, and life 
is blissful. You spend all day taking 
pictures and getting Internet karma from its little face. You spend all of your money on toys and designer 
puppy food, doting on the creature 
like a proud parent.
Then it happens.The pup turns evil. It destroys 
your carpet, tears up your brand new shoes and chews on one of your only pieces of furniture. Panic en-sues, and you can’t remember what life was like before this little demon 
took it over.
I’m happy to say that there is 
help. All of these things happened 
to me for weeks on end, and I didn’t know what I was doing wrong: I gave up, and ﬁ  gured that my puppy hated me and was out to get me. Then I found Cesar’s Way.Cesar Milan may be overexposed, 
but he is for a reason: His methods work. At 3 1/2 months old, my pup-py can go to the bathroom outside and walk on a leash along with sev-eral other commands, which makes me feel like I have control over my life again. Here is what we learned.
How to go to the bathroom outside
In my research, I read something 
from Cesar that really stuck with 
me: “A dog who understands that you, as the pack leader, own the space in which he lives will respect your asserted authority while dog training.”
When we were going outside, I 
was not acting like a pack leader. In-stead of giving my puppy direction, I let her run wild in the yard for as long as she wanted. I didn’t project a calm and conﬁ  dent persona, which Cesar insists on, and I didn’t provide any consequences for misbehavior.Now, if she has an accident in-
side, I immediately take her to the yard, on a leash, and wait for her to go. I don’t acknowledge her un-til she has gone to the bathroom at least once, and I immediately tell her she’s a “good girl” when she does. I also take her to the same exact spot 
in the yard each time.
If she doesn’t go to the bathroom 
after ten minutes, I put her in her 
crate for ten minutes without look-ing at her.
After the ﬁ  rst week, I noticed 
changes. She’s not completely acci-dent-free yet, but I’m conﬁ  dent that it won’t be long before she is.
How to walk on a leash
In Alachua County, dogs must be 
secured by a leash when they are off 
of their owner’s property, accord-ing to the Alachua County Animal Services Ordinance section 72.12, so leash training should be one of the ﬁ  rst things you practice with your puppy.
 Cesar’s idea of pack leadership is 
even more important when it comes to walking your dog on a leash. On his website, Cesar states that the ﬁ  rst energy a puppy feels is his or her mother’s “calm, assertive energy,” and that it will respond positively to energy that mimics that for the rest of its life. To get your puppy to be-
have and move forward on a walk, 
then, you must exude the energy that your puppy wants to respond to.
By standing tall and alert, look-
ing forward, your puppy will be ob-
ligated to follow your lead and walk 
forward with you. There will be con-stant distractions – mine enjoys pick-ing up every stick that she passes on the sidewalk – but you can’t indulge them. I just keep walking forward, often without looking at my puppy directly, and she follows me.
If your puppy is having a hard 
time behaving on the walk, Cesar suggests bringing family members or a more experienced dog with you on the walk to ease tension.
Once my puppy learned how 
to do these two things, training be-came easier. She now knows how to sit, shake and stay in her crate with-out whining.
The biggest thing to remember 
about training a puppy is that they want to respond strong leadership 
and they enjoy learning new things: 
You just have to be the one to take that ﬁ  rst step, and your puppy will follow. MONDAY, AUGUST 18, 2014 � ALLIGATOR,  NEW STUDENT EDITION, 27

Congratulations! You’ve 
been accepted into the Uni-
versity of Florida. Too bad 
you can’t legally partake in 
what some consider an inte-gral part of the college expe-rience — drinking.
A recent post on the popu-
lar YikYak app said, “Being under 21 in New York is like being 4 foot tall at an amuse-ment park.”
The same could also be 
said about UF. Being under-age doesn’t just mean that you can’t drink legally in public, 
but you also won’t be able to 
get into some of the popular bars here in Gainesville. 
But, if you don’t 
mind paying $7 to get 
into a bar where you 
can’t drink and there’s no space to dance, then Midtown is the 
place to be. 
The 21-and-up bars 
in Midtown are Fat Daddy’s, 
Balls, Rowdy Reptile and Salty Dog Saloon. 
This leaves you with 
Grog, 101 Cantina, Shuck and Envy/Gator City. 
Keep in mind, the Alliga-
tor doesn’t condone under-age drinking, as it is against the law. And for those of age, here is a quick rundown of Gainesville’s open container 
law: 
Don’t do it. 
Check out Gainesville City 
Ordinance 4-4b for more in-
formation. 
For those who choose a 
more sober route to going 
out, then do not go to 101 Cantina. There’s hardly any 
space to dance, there’s no DJ and everyone else around 
you is getting uncomfortably wasted. It may be free, but 
save that cute outﬁ  t for an-
other time. 
Grog, on the other hand, 
is a great place for under-21 partygoers. The best night 
is Wednesday because it’s 
ladies night. Although you can’t drink, you can still en-joy the music. 
Grog plays a little bit of 
everything: rap, house and even some reggaeton. The best part of your night will be watching the drunk people 
who don’t know Spanish try 
to sing along to Daddy Yan-kee’s “Gasolina.”
The only issue with Grog is 
when it gets packed, it also gets really hot. You’ll end up mak-ing multiple trips to the bathroom to wipe 
your face so you 
don’t look like some type of lake monster. 
Envy, which is attached to 
Gator City, is fun on Fridays. Everyone goes for the 25-cent wells, but the music isn’t half bad either. However, some-times Envy can get a little bit 
ratchet.
Shuck is not so bad, either. 
It’s outside, which means you 
won’t be sweating buckets 
like you would in Grog or 
Envy. The downside is that you run the chance of getting some serious mosquito bites.
Being under 21 in college 
isn’t all bad. Stick to these tips and tricks to having a good time in Midtown, and count down the days until you can 
order your own grown-up 
drink. Not 21? It’s OK —
Midtown still has bars for you

Thanks to the Internet, it’s 
easier than ever to discover new 
music — just see who Pitchfork’s 
reviewing lately, open Pando-
ra/Spotify/Sirius XM or click 
over to a friend-of-a-friend’s 
SoundCloud profile. This ease 
of access, though, is no match 
for discovering new music the 
old-fashioned way: by taking a 
chance and stopping by a local 
dive bar for a live show. 
If you’re a music junkie in 
Gainesville for the first time, 
you’re in luck. Not only does 
UF invite huge acts like Chance 
the Rapper, Best Coast, Child-
ish Gambino and Passion Pit, 
but Gainesville itself is a hub for 
both well-known and emerg-
ing artists. Some of the city’s 
alumni include Less Than Jake, 
Hundred Waters, Sister Hazel, 
Against Me!, Hot Water Music 
and, of course, Tom Petty and 
the Heartbreakers. It’s basically 
a mini-Austin. 
With that, check it out: your

gae, and they offer craft and local microbrewed beers. 
The Atlantic, Neon Liger and The Backyard
If you’d rather dance than thrash around at a punk show, 
head to the Atlantic, Neon Liger or The Backyard at Boca 
Fiesta to hear local DJs spin. Stay hydrated, because it gets 
pretty sweaty in there — but that’s part of the fun.Open mic & karaoke roundup
If you’d rather hang out and watch brave strangers perform 
solo sets, the coffee shops and smaller bars in Gainesville 
offer karaoke and open-mic nights almost every night dur -
ing the week. Check out Cymplify on Thursday nights, The 
Backyard at Boca Fiesta, live open mic at Loosey’s or Coffee 
Culture on Sunday nights to watch amateur performers — or 
become one yourself!

So, new student, after trying dining hall 
food at Preview, you’ve decided it isn’t up 
to snuff compared with what you’d imag-
ine is Le Cordon Bleu-standard meals you 
get at home. 
Lucky for you, you don’t have to settle 
for a diet made up entirely of cookies, piz-
za and study-break Starbucks (unless you 
want to of course, but I don’t recommend it. You also don’t want to eat an entire can of cinnamon rolls for dinner … trust me.)
The most important thing for those liv-
ing in dorms or in tiny apartments that may or may not have full kitchens (shout-out to studio residents: You have the toughest job ahead of you) to remember is to make the 
best of what you have. You can’t expect to 
make magic out of your cheap Ikea pots and pans, but you also don’t need high-end things to make great food.
Here are a few tips to get you started:
1. For students in residence halls: Know 
what appliances you can and can’t have in 
your rooms. There’s a detailed list on UF’s housing website, but in general, you can 
have appliances that don’t have exposed 
heating elements. This includes rice cook-ers, slow cookers and microwaves, but it does not include hot plates, toaster ovens or wafﬂ  e makers, which you can only use 
in the shared kitchen. 
This may seem limiting, but safety ﬁ  rst: 
The last thing you want is to burn down 
your whole ﬂ  oor when your George Fore-
man grill catches a towel on ﬁ  re.
2. That being said, simplify your tools.  You don’t need a million niche applianc-
es and cookware. You can get by with a decent heavy-bottom pot and a medium-size saute pan. (If you’re into baking, one 
cookie sheet and cake pan.) That breakfast 
sandwich maker you thought was a bril-liant idea at the time will only give you guilt stares from your closet if you don’t 
force yourself to make a sandwich for ev-
ery meal.
3. Work with your lim-
ited space. When it comes to what groceries to buy, 
say no to large quanti-
ties. I know logic tells you buying in bulk will save you money, but with mini 
fridges and a late applica-
tion triples, you just don’t have the space. 
So buy what you know you like in small quantities so nothing goes to waste.
4. Pick things that won’t get boring. 
Chicken and eggs may take up a lot of space, but they are some of the most use-ful ingredients to keep on hand. Find a few go-to recipes, but also go out of your com-
fort zone by searching for more recipes 
online or asking your neighbors for their favorites. 
5. For studios only: If you only have a 
microwave and a fridge, the best invest-
ment is a couple coiled hot plates (or ideally 
one induction hot plate) and a convection toaster oven that goes up to 450 degrees. This will let you cook most things, even 
most baked goodies. Fair warning: Cakes 
and cookies are no problem, but baking sa-vory things like chicken or a pasta bake is 
going to take a while.6. Safety safety safety: To repeat, know 
how to keep all your belongings and ﬁ  n-
gers intact. Always unplug appliances when you aren’t using them. Be mindful 
of how hot things are and use protection 
(that rule works in all walks of life). Prac-tice safe knife skills such as curling your ﬁ  ngers under and keeping your blades sharp (you have to use more force with dull knives, leading to more accidents). And last but not least, just don’t eat ques-tionable food: when in doubt, throw that 
rank Chinese food out.
 That’s it. Good luck, soon-to-be gour-
mets. Make your childhood Food Network 
dreams come true.

Freshman Rhamat 
Alhassan brings height and talent to the UF volleyball team. Read 
the story on page 46NEW STUDENT EDITION
THE RALLY
And so we have arrived at the mil-
lion dollar question pertaining to the 2014 Florida football season: 
How many games is this team going to win, and how will it perform in general? Summer alligatorSports editor Jonathan Czupryn and assistant Richard Johnson 
got together to rally in order to give new 
University of Florida students a preview of what’s to come.
Jonathan: The Florida Gators not only 
limped their way to the ﬁ  nish line last 
year, but they also endured the longest off-
season the program has had in more than 20 years. 
In the 260 days since Florida State closed 
the books on Will Muschamp’s third year at UF, both the players and the coaches have been grilled on expectations for the upcoming 
season and what 
it might take to avoid another di-saster.
No team is 
more anxious to start the year than the Gators, who kick off their 2014 cam-paign on Aug. 30. 
With a new-look offense, a youthfully 
driven defense and a motivation to move past an ugly 4-8 stain on the program, Florida has a good chance to play spoiler 
in the Southeastern Conference’s Eastern 
Division.The Gators were 
picked to ﬁ  nish be-hind South Caro-
lina and Georgia by 
the media, but the SEC is a difﬁ  cult league to accurately 
predict. 
Only twice since 
the inception of SEC 
Media Days have the journalists correctly 
predicted the eventual conference cham-
pion – in each case UF was the favorite.
This time last year, you would have 
looked foolish picking a 3-9 Auburn squad 
to represent the Western Division in the 
conference championship in Atlanta. 
You would have looked mental picking the Tigers to reach the national champion-
ship.
Now it’s easy to look at Gus Malzahn’s 
team and say, ‘Why can’t UF do that?’ But that might cause some incredibly lofty ex-pectations for Muschamp and company in 2014.
Don’t use Auburn’s 2013 season as 
the benchmark for struggling teams, but instead use it as an example of best-case scenario.
There’s no reason why the Gators 
shouldn’t make progress in 2014. Should we see an Auburn-like turnaround in Gainesville? Doubtful, but Florida certain-ly has the motivation and enough young 
talent to at least get some attention now in 
How successful will the Florida football team be in 2014?

Safety Keanu Neal (42) reaches to tackle wide receiver Ryan Parrish (15) during practice on Thursday. 
Muschamp said Neal and Vernon Hargreaves III are the only deﬁ  nite starters so far in the secondary.
RICHARD JOHNSON
Alligator Staff Writer @RagjUF
The scabs on  safety Keanu 
Neal’s knees and his torn up index 
ﬁ  nger are not football injuries. 
They don’t stem from the bone-
crunching hit he leveled on run-
ning back Matt Jones on Thursday 
or any of the other big hits he’s laid so far during fall camp. 
No, Neal’s bumps and bruises 
come from a scooter accident he had a few weeks before camp started with his girlfriend Kytra Hunter — a Florida 
gymnast — on the back of it.
Motorized scooters have been 
one of Florida’s toughest oppo-nents during coach Will Mus-champ’s tenure in Gainesville. 
All-American punter Kyle 
Christy fell off one leading to a shoulder injury that forced him to have surgery in the 2013 offsea-son. Offensive lineman Tyler Moore 
crashed on his prior to the Georgia game in 2013, breaking his right arm and sidelining him for the rest of the season. 
Defensive lineman Joey Ivie 
also cut his foot during a scooter accident prior to the Florida State game in 2013. The then-freshman was forced to sit out last season’s season ﬁ  nale because of it.

Dear freshmen, and really 
anyone reading this: Don’t try 
this at home.
It’s not smart to watch 
anything for 24 hours straight 
much less the Southeastern 
Conference’s militant bragga-docio factory nestled securely inside your residence hall’s cable box. 
I’m doing this so you don’t 
have to. I’m doing this so you can study and work hard your freshman year, so you can ap-
ply yourself and do well as 
you start on your college path. You shouldn’t have to worry about the programs on the SEC Network — enjoy your lives, check in every now and then to what the network’s do-ing. But for a time, follow me as we venture deep into the 
tortured recesses of my mind 
as I critique the programming and try to stay awake. Come with me through this day-long journey.
I’ll give grades to the origi-
nal programming aired during this process, so without further adieu, welcome to the begin-
ning of the SEC Network.
6:00 - 7:00 p.m.: For more 
than two years, we’ve been promised a chance to “take it 
all in” from the SEC Network’s public relations campaign. 
Finally on Thursday, the in-
augural episode of SEC Now kicked off the network. I’ve written multiple times about carriage deals, cost per sub-scriber in footprint and now — ﬁ  nally — commissioner Mike Slive’s world domination plan, years in the making comes to fruition. We’ve heard so many 
things about what this thing 
could, or should, be and ﬁ  nally the lights are on.
The ﬁ  rst on-campus footage 
in SEC Network history shows the north end zone of Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n stadium, and a hair-raising highlight reel. Fresh-men, I know Florida went 
4-8 last season. I know you’re 
going to whine about the fact that it’s hot at noon games and yadda yadda yadda. Just hush and buy your season tickets so athletics director Jeremy Foley doesn’t have to send any more emails begging you to do so.
I’ll never forgive Brent 
Musberger for saying some-thing other than “You are look-ing (S)live . . . ” as the ﬁ  rst live on-camera words in the net-work’s history. I can, however, forgive Tim Tebow, for drop-ping a “we” when speaking SEC Network makes 
television debut

FOOTBALL , from page 35
from his players, but he does 
ask the team to exercise cau-tion when using them. Since Neal is alright, Muschamp was able to laugh the situation off.
“He had a tire slip this 
summer. His girlfriend is a gymnast. She’s a much better athlete than him,” Muschamp said. “Nothing happened to her. He messed his ﬁ  nger up. She’s a lot better athlete. I should have recruited her.”
Neal echoed Muschamp’s 
notion that Hunter was the better athlete on the scooter that day.
“She like landed and skid 
on her stomach and kicked her legs back or something like that and bounced up,” Neal said. “I like tumbled and hit every part of my body but she came out 
with a little scratch and I came 
out with every scratch that you can think of.”
When Neal is on two legs 
instead of two wheels, he’s the best safety on the team, according to Muschamp. He lends stability to a secondary group that — outside of Ver-
non Hargreaves — is full of in-
experience, inconsistency and injury.
“It means a lot to me to be 
considered that,” Neal said. “But I’m not going to think 
about that too much because 
you know it’s good to think of yourself as an underdog and continue to compete every single day.”
Neal says the attitude of 
competitiveness is one every team should have — the want to get better day in and day out 
should be a constant. He says 
this year his effort has gotten better as has his play recogni-tion — often times for younger players the game tends to slow down in their second season. 
The biggest thing he 
learned last year watching from the sideline was effort as 
well as the need to be techni-
cally sound.
He’s learned to “bring (his) 
arms” when getting ready to tackle someone, which is a technique that minimizes the launching of the body that has become such a taboo in football nationwide and some-
thing that referees are calling 
more and more thanks to col-lege football’s targeting rule. 
He has an image on Flori-
da’s team — not of just another Gator that had a mishap on a moped — but as a heavy hit-ter, maybe even following in the footsteps of Reggie Nelson, 
Major Wright and Matt Elam 
at the safety position.
“I just love to play football,” 
Neal said. “And I’m a physical player and you know the hits come and I’ve kinda built that 
image on the team as a hitter 
so that’s just what I do.”
Editor’s Note: A version of 
this story ran online August 13.
MONDAY, AUGUST 18, 2014 � ALLIGATOR,  NEW STUDENT EDITION, 37
Florida faces tough task of facing ‘Bama, FSU on the road 
the Eastern Division.
Richard: The Gators picked 
a pretty solid time to have a re-
building year in terms of how 
the conference looks on paper (few proven quarterbacks, few offenses that appear able to put 
up 45 points on a whim) — but 
that doesn’t mean they’re going to have one, at least in terms of win-loss record. 
The weird thing about where 
Florida football is right now is that a four-win improvement over last year could still get Will Muschamp ﬁ  red. 
The Eastern Division may be 
set up to win now with only one sure thing in my mind (South Carolina) and a beatable Georgia team that is only going to get bet-
ter as the season nears its end, and 
as long as it can stay healthy. 
The problem Florida has is its 
Western Division schedule ro-
tation. The Gators didn’t draw 
Arkansas as their rotating oppo-nent. Instead, they get Alabama and then there is the always vul-nerable LSU. 
Sure the Tigers lost 800 start-
ers to the NFL, but head coach Les Miles has proven that he’s 
going to put a double-digit win 
total team on the ﬁ  eld come hell or high water. 
So that leaves UF with a sched-
ule that seems like it comes pre-packaged with four losses — Ala-
bama, South Carolina, LSU and 
Florida State — and a maybe de-feat to Georgia. Congratulations, you’ve got the attention you seek with a team that’ll probably get a 
decent bowl matchup, but you’ve 
also got a team second or third in its division that doesn’t strike much optimism in the heart of its 
fanbase. 
The thing with Florida is be-
cause the fanbase is so slaveishly 
devoted to a team that puts up points, it’s not about how much 
this particular team wins or los-
es, but more importantly what it looks like doing so. 
Lose to South Carolina at home 
but in a 38-31 contest where Jeff Driskel throws for 350 yards, and maybe the tide of the fanbase will turn.
Jonathan: The SEC is no lon-
ger a league where the schedule comes with “pre-packaged” wins or losses.
How can South Carolina pencil 
in a victory against Florida when the game is in Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium? The Gamecocks needed four ﬁ  eld goals and a late-game interception to knock off third-
string quarterback Skyler Morn-
hinweg and the Gators last year in Columbia.
Is it that far fetched to think 
UF at least has a ﬁ  ghting chance against USC this year? Jeff Driskel is healthy, Kurt Roper brings a new offense and Muschamp is coaching to keep his job.
That doesn’t sound like a team 
that is ready to be counted out.
Oh, and Florida also gets LSU 
in The Swamp as well. Even when Muschamp was out a starting 
quarterback and running back, 
the Tigers never really created any real separation.Les Miles’ offense scored 17 
points against the Gators’ D. LSU came into the Florida matchup averaging about 45 points per game.
Although wins on the road 
against FSU and ‘Bama are far less likely than taking two away from USC and LSU, Florida should not be considered a guaranteed ‘W’ 
for any team.
The weapons the Gators have 
are still SEC-caliber players 
yearning to make the program relevant again. Don’t underesti-
mate this team’s hunger to win.

Have no fear, the 2014 Florida 
football season is practically here. 
With just 12 days until Florida kicks off its season against Idaho, here are a few players to keep an eye on this year that you might not know.
Jake McGee, tight end: Flori-
da’s offense got a big boost when 
tight end Jake McGee announced 
his transfer to Florida from Virgin-ia. In three seasons that included 36 games for the Cavaliers, McGee re-corded 71 catches for 769 yards. He was efficient when it mattered too, making 14 of his 43 total catches last season on third down. McGee’s 6-foot-6, 255-pound frame can serve as a reliable target for quarterback Jeff Driskel this season.
Treon Harris, quarterback: 
You’re probably wondering why 
I’m talking about a quarterback who 
isn’t named Jeff Driskel for this sea-son. But don’t be surprised if Harris is used in some short-yardage situ-ations in 2014. He’s a quarterback first, but he has impressive wheels that can be used in some packages on third or second-and-short in-stances. Offensive coordinator Kurt Roper will be able to use Harris’ speed effectively this season.
Demarcus Robinson, wide re-
ceiver: Robinson’s name is probably familiar to you as he is entering his sophomore year. However Robin-
son was limited to just seven games 
last year due to suspensions. 
The suspensions were a result 
of Robinson “violating team rules.” Since that time, Robinson has had no conduct issues and had a very impressive spring at receiver. He accounted for five receptions — matching his total from the 2013 season — for 53 yards and a touch-down in the Orange and Blue De-but. 
If Robinson can continue to keep 
out of trouble, he is primed for a breakout season.
Jalen Tabor and Duke Dawson, 
cornerback: Two early enrollees are given the opportunity to start at cornerback opposite of Vernon Hargreaves III thanks to the depar-tures of defensive backs Marcus Roberson and Loucheiz Purifoy. 
Both Tabor and Dawson are 
battling for the spot at fall camp, and at this point there isn’t much separation between the two. Ta-bor stepped on campus as the No. 3-ranked overall corner in the 2014 class and has consistent instincts at the position that can earn him the 
start as a true freshman. 
Dawson came in as a four-star 
corner and has seen reps at the 
nickel spot as well. Both guys have the potential come in and make im-mediate impacts early.
McGee, Robinson among players ready to make an impact
Within the next month, sev-
en UF sports that aren’t named football will begin 
their seasons.
Ten sports that don’t play in Ben 
Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium will be in action by the time October rolls around.
And while the attention of most 
fans will focus on the team in the Swamp and whether the Gators can rebound from their 4-8 season, those other teams will each begin their own quest for a national title.Here are a few teams to look out 
for:
Soccer: Florida soccer’s offense 
in 2013 could practically be summed up in two words: Savannah Jordan. 
During her freshman campaign 
at UF, Jordan tallied 22 goals and 47 points — the most in both categories since current US Women’s National Team phenom Abby Wambach scored 31 goals and 76 points back in 2001 — en route to becoming the ﬁ  rst freshman to be recognized as the Southeastern Con-ference Offensive Play-er of the Year.
The Gators ﬁ  nished 
the season with an 18-
5-1 record, won a share 
of the SEC regular-sea-son title and reached the NCAA Tourna-ment for the 11th con-secutive year.
UF returns 11 of its starters from 
2013, highlighted by Jordan and fellow SEC and NCAA All-South 
Region ﬁ  rst-team selections in mid-
ﬁ  elder Havana Solaun and defender Christen Westphal.
Florida opens its season on Fri-
day against Miami at 7 p.m. at James G. Pressly Stadium.
Volleyball: The volleyball team 
is poised for a great season in 2014.
While coach Mary Wise will be 
without the tandem of two-time SEC Player of the Year and two-time All-American Chloe Mann, who ﬁ  n-ished her UF career as the NCAA leader in hitting percentage, and set-ter Taylor Brauneis — who tallied more than 2400 assists in two years at UF — her squad is ﬁ  lled with ex-perience.Returning from last 
year’s squad that went 28-4 overall and 16-2 in conference play are the two most recent 
SEC Freshmen of the 
Year in sophomore Alex Holston and ju-nior Ziva Recek, who combined for 620 kills last season; 2013 SEC 
Libero of the Year Taylor Unroe, who led the SEC with 41 service aces; and its entire defensive special-
ist staff that averaged almost 14 digs 
per set and paced the SEC with 1.57 aces per set.
Highlighting the group is 6-foot-4 
middle blocker Rhamat Alhassan, who led the US Women’s Junior National Team to a ﬁ  rst-place ﬁ  nish at the U20 NORCECA Continental Championships in July.
The volleyball team opens its 
schedule with the two-day Active Ankle Tournament from Aug. 29-30, where it will play host to Geor-gia Southern, Idaho and Oklahoma in the O’Connell Center.
Swimming and Diving: Gregg 
Troy has a knack for ﬁ  nding talent.
Ever since he took over the helm of UF’s women’s swimming and diving team in 1998 and its men’s team in 1999, he only had one oc-casion where one of his teams did not crack the top 10 at the NCAA 
Championships (women ﬁ  nished 
19th in 2000).
His teams lost valuable players, 
including four Olympians — Sebas-tien Rousseau and Marcin Cieslak on the men’s side and Elizabeth Bei-sel and Hilda Luthersdoittr from the women’s squad — but returns 14 athletes who garnered a combined 
43 All-America honors in 2014.
Troy also boasts a solid recruiting 
class, headlined by the No. 1 recruit 
on the men’s side in Caeleb Dressel. 
Dressel, out of Jacksonville Bolles 
School, set the national high school record for the 50-yard freestyle with a time of 19.29 seconds, which is faster than any swimmer returning 
to UF this season posted during the 
2013-14 campaign.
The men’s squad begins its sea-
son with the ﬁ  fth-annual All-Florida Invitational, taking place from Oct. 3-5 in the O’Connell Center.
The women have a home meet 
against Arkansas on Sept. 27 at 11 a.m. to begin their season.

Jacksonville on Nov. 16 during the ﬁ  rst round of the NCAA Tournament at James G. Pressly Stadium. UF begins its season Friday at 7 p.m.
WHAT TO EXPECT
Looking beyond the swamp: UF teams poised for big seasons
Men’s Cross Country: The men’s cross country team had a 
strong showing in 2013. Led by senior Mark Parrish — who broke the school’s record for the fastest 8K in his ﬁ  nal year — the team claimed a berth in the 31-team NCAA Champion-ship ﬁ  eld after ﬁ  nishing second at NCAA Regionals. Coach Paul Spangler’s men’s squad is in good shape heading into 2014, returning three of his top ﬁ  ve runners and bringing in a recruiting class that is nine runners strong.
Women’s Cross Country: The women’s cross country team 
was not as successful as their counterparts in 2013, ﬁ  nish-ing fourth at both the SEC Championships and the NCAA Regional Championship. Spangler returns just one runner — sophomore Taylor Tubbs — who consistently ﬁ  nished in the top ﬁ  ve for Florida.
Men’s Golf: For the ﬁ  rst time in 27 years, the UF men’s golf 
team will not be helmed by Buddy Alexander. Replacing the eight-time SEC Coach of the Year and the three-time GCAA National Coach of the Year is J.C. Deacon, the former as-sistant coach at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. The men’s golf team, which did not clinch a berth in the NCAA Championship last season for the ﬁ  rst time since 1999, will play four tournaments in the fall.
Women’s Golf: Led by second-year coach Emily Glaser, the 
women’s golf team reached the NCAA Championships and ﬁ  nished tied for 18th in Tulsa, Okla., a one spot drop from the 2013 championships. The team will play three tourna-ments during the fall to prepare for their spring schedule.
Men’s Tennis: The men’s tennis team ﬁ  nished the 2013-14 
season with a 17-10 record and making it to the NCAA Round of 16. Coach Bryan Shelton will look to bring the Gators over the hump in his third year. The team returns two ranked play-ers from last season — junior Gordon Watson (No. 109 in singles) and sophomore Elliott Orkin (No. 105 in singles). The team plays seven tournaments in the fall, including two at the Ring Tennis Complex.
Women’s Tennis: The women’s tennis team fell in the NCAA 
Semiﬁ  nals in 2014, marking the ﬁ  fth year that the team reached the Final Four. Despite losing three of the most decorated players in UF tennis history in Alex Cercone, Olivia Janowicz and Soﬁ  e Oyen, coach Roland Thornqvist returns an up-and-rising team led by junior Brianna Morgan. The team plays in seven tournaments this fall.

� UF HAS LARGEST ROSTER 
SINCE AT LEAST 1996.
EDEN OTERO
Alligator Staff Writer @edenotero_l
Coach Mary Wise has many 
reasons to be excited about this 
year’s volleyball squad.
With one of the deepest rosters 
since at least 1996, the tallest signee 
in Florida history in 6-foot-4 fresh-
man Rhamat Alhassan and a No. 10 ranking in the AVCA Top-25 preseason poll, the 2014 campaign is looking to be one of the most promising yet.
And while preseason training 
has only been in session for a few days, seniors Holly Pole, Maddy 
Monserez and Taylor Unroe are 
basking in the glory of what it means to be a senior.
However, what makes this se-
nior squad different is their posi-tions. Unusually enough, they all play the back line.
Pole, originally a walk-on in 
2011, has been key to the Gators 
back line as a defensive specialist. 
In 2012, she played in 32 of 33 
games and made a season-high 14 
digs in a win over LSU to clinch the Southeastern Conference. She completed the 2013 season with 224 digs and started in 14 of 32 matches, seeing time in all 108 sets during her junior year.
While the Ocala, Fla., native 
didn’t have the same experience as other recruits on the court during her journey to Florida, coach Mary Wise sees her as a necessary com-ponent in bringing the back line 
together.
“Holly arguably has the highest 
volleyball IQ on our team,” Wise 
said. “Holly is constantly coach-ing up her teammates and I think when it’s all said and done, some may say Holly may be one of the best walk-on players we’ve ever had — it would be fair, but I think 
at the end of the day we can say 
Holly is one of the best defensive players we’ve ever had.”
Joining Pole as a defensive spe-
cialist is Monserez. In 2012 Mon-serez started 32 of 33 games and she recorded a career high 16 digs in Florida’s sweep against Tulsa in the ﬁ  rst round of the NCAA Tour-
nament. In 2013, she ﬁ  nished the 
season with 113 digs and started in six of 29 matches.
While Monserez and Pole play 
as defensive specialists on the back line, Unroe holds the libero posi-tion.
The Muncie, Ind., native ﬁ  n-
ished 2013 as the SEC Libero of the 
Year, leading the SEC in aces (41) 
and being ninth in the conference in digs (415).
With the three preparing them-
selves and the ﬁ  ve freshmen for the 2014 season, Unroe said the team is just looking to become bet-ter as a unit.
“We always want to have the 
best season possible, do our part in the gym, focus on our side of the net and just do the things we can control to get the farthest in the SEC and the (NCAA) Tourna-
ment,” Unroe said. “We just want 
to focus on ourselves.”
However, Wise is less focused 
on the future and more focused on the here and now. The coach enter-ing her 24th season at UF is using the preseason to bring together the team and is pleased with her se-
niors’ leadership.
“I think if you were to describe 
this senior class of Maddy, Holly 
and Taylor, it would be they are the worker bees,” Wise said. “The amount of work they have put in over the past four years to improve their game and to make each other 
better . . . They all play the same 
position. It’s very unique, they are looking at competition as bringing their best to make the other person better as well.”

Florida men’s bas-
ketball achieved greatness last 
season.
A 30-game win 
streak. An undefeated 
record in the O’Connell 
Center for the second straight season. A per-fect run through the Southeastern Confer-ence. A Final Four berth — its ﬁ  rst since 2007.
And even though Florida’s reg-
ular-season debut against William 
& Mary is still a little less than three 
months away, one thing will be ap-parent when the Gators take to the O’Connell Center come November: The team you see will not look the same as last year.
Gone are UF’s four seniors — 
Casey Prather, Scottie Wilbekin, Will Yeguete and Patric Young — 
who accounted for 57.9 percent of 
Florida’s offensive production, 51.1 percent of its rebounds and a .501 shooting clip.
Gone is the winningest class in 
program history, accruing 120 victo-ries over its four-year run.
But coach Billy Donovan still 
has talent on his team as he enters 
his 19th season as head coach. He 
returns valuable playmakers, play-ers capable of making another deep postseason run.
Shooting guard Michael Frazier 
II, UF’s lone returning starter from last season, looks poised to have an-other solid campaign heading into his third year at UF. The Tam-pa native paced the Gators in three-point-
ers (118) — 11 of which 
came in record-setting fashion against South Carolina on March 4 — and shooting clip from beyond the arc (.447).
Dorian Finney-Smith, the 2013 
SEC Sixth Man of the Year, should see more starting time in his second 
year at UF. The redshirt junior and 
Virginia Tech transfer led the Gators in rebounds per game (6.7) and was the lone player to average more than 20 minutes per contest off the bench in his ﬁ  rst year on the court since leaving the Hokies. 
Kasey Hill and Chris Walker 
— Florida’s two McDonald’s All-
Americans from its 2013 recruiting 
class — will develop heading into their second year under Donovan. 
Hill showed ﬂ  ashes of potential 
during his ﬁ  rst year while playing behind Wilbekin at point guard. The Umatilla, Fla., native ﬁ  nished the year by averaging 3.1 rebounds and 5.5 points per game on a 40.7-
percent shooting clip.
Walker, who was ineligible dur-
ing the fall semester, was held out of 
the ﬁ  rst 12 games after the fall ended due to an NCAA suspension and  saw limited action, averaging just 4.8 minutes per game. 
But in those 87 minutes where he wasn’t on the bench, Walker amassed a .593 ﬁ  eld goal clip 24 re-bounds and eight blocks. 
Add in a healthy Eli Carter (right 
leg) and Dillon Graham (bone spurs 
in hip), who sat out last season, as 
well as a duo of transfers in Alex Murphy from Duke and John Eg-bunu from USF, and Donovan is poised to have a capable team.
The season won’t be easy, with 
a road match against Kansas, a re-
match against national champion 
UConn and the Battle 4 Atlantis Tournament at Paradise Island, Bahamas — where Florida could possibly compete against 2014 Elite Eight Teams Wisconsin and UCLA back-to-back — peppered in the 
non-conference slate in addition to 
an 18-game SEC slate.

about the Florida Gators in his ﬁ  rst 
on-camera appearance (something Twitter didn’t take too kindly to). 
If you’re looking for the bas-
tion of journalistic integrity, I feel like you’re in the wrong place. SEC Network president Justin Connolly told me at SEC Media Days that the network isn’t in place to do hard-hitting investigative journalism work, and its calling card is on the passion and pride of the conference anyway. 
Oh, and Missouri graduate John 
Anderson — whose day job is to be a SportsCenter anchor — dropped a “we” too when referring to the Tigers during a live shot. 
7:00 - 8:00 p.m.: Slive opens the 
hour dipping into his brag bag, with a subtle lower-third graphic saying that the SEC’s 14 member 
schools have won 72 NCAA titles 
during his tenure and distributed more than $300 million to each school in the recent revenue distri-bution cycle. He’s doing an inter-view with Musberger, and the set appears straight off of a PBS special with the average age decades north of AARP eligibility. 
Suddenly, Kentucky’s basket-
ball coach John Calapari is standing in front of an aquarium in the Baha-mas. Yes, it’s as weird as it sounds. 
Not only is the Wildcats head-
man a bit tanner than when I last saw him in Arlington, Texas, during the Final Four, but for some reason there’s something other than foot-ball being shown on the network. I didn’t see that in the masthead and I’ve followed this network since its initial announcement.
I jest of course but covering 
basketball is deﬁ  nitely more ex-cusable than waiting 50 minutes to interview Steve Spurrier for the ﬁ  rst time in hour No. 1 — that’s just wrong. 
8:00 - 9:00 p.m.: We’re starting 
to come off the rails here with SEC Now as we venture into the “this show is getting way too long” part 
of the program. 
Exhibit A: there’s an analyst 
mounting a horse. There’s a suitable amount of UF 
ﬂ  avor in this hour. Tim Tebow and 
Joe Tessitore pair up for a fatal-4-way with Gators gymnast Bridget Sloan and softball outﬁ  elder Kirsti Merritt. 
Later in the hour, Tess and 
Tebow double team coach Will Muschamp in an interview and 
go back and forth about how the 
team will do this season, but also how Muschamp — then an assis-tant coach at Auburn — devised a gameplan to stop Tebow in 2007. 
The banter was good, but there 
was a hilarious clip shown of a much younger Will Muschamp holding back former Tigers head 
coach Tommy Tuberville as the lat-
ter blew his top at a referee. Little did Muschamp know that four years later he’d be doing the same on the opposite sideline. 
My ﬁ  nal grade for SEC Now: C.I’m not sure what you can glean 
in terms of total performance from a show’s opener that is three times 
as long as the show will regularly 
run.
I want to see it in the dead of July with no football to hype up.
I want to see it when a scandal 
breaks.
And I want to see it share more 
original stories than the one they did Thursday.
I do think Dari Nowkhah is very 
strong in the main chair, which comes after being with ESPN for 
10 years. His back and forth with 
Calapari was very choppy but I think that may have had a bit to do with the satellite delay between Charlotte, N.C., and the Bahamas.
His co-anchor, Maria Taylor, 
seems talented but needs a bit more polish. She was awkward at times,  like when she said the wrong title 
for Paul Finebaum’s book and had 
difﬁ  culty with the word “era.” But I understand it is her ﬁ  rst show.
Marcus Spears and Booger Mc-
Farland are going to be a lot of fun as analysts, but I think Greg McEl-roy has the makings of a really big asset for ESPN moving forward. He’ll get games in the future, and 
he’ll knock them out of the park. 
Tim Tebow also has a lot of 
room to grow. He’s a bit robotic in his approach on-screen for my lik-
ing, and like I mentioned earlier, I don’t mind him dropping a “we” about his old school. He received a birthday cake on camera, which now makes it the second time an ESPN platform has wished him happy birthday on live television. The network infamously did the 
same a few years ago in an awful 
Tebowmania daytime SportsCen-ter trainwreck.
 There were a couple techni-
cal issues as well, sound dropping out on a few microphones and a clunky live mic’d up segment with Missisippi State coach Dan Mullen in which the Bulldogs head man 
barely said anything. 
9:00 - 10:00 p.m.: Let’s ﬁ  rst kick 
hour No. 4 off with the notion that 
there are two certainties as it per-tains to the SEC Storied documen-tary, “The Stars Aligned”: notable Kentucky basketball fan Ashley Judd is crazy, and country singer Charlie Daniels is awesome. Judd 
made my roommate bust out laugh-
ing as she spoke about crying every

Tim Tebow answers a question during an interview on the set of ESPN’s new SEC Network in Charlotte, 
N.C., on Aug. 5. Tebow, a former Gator, is an analyst for the network, which debuted on Thursday.
Tim Tebow has time to develop more natural on-camera skills
time she enters Rupp Arena and I 
could watch Daniels’ giant white beard talk about Tennessee football any day of the year.
Florida’s biggest fan was Em-
mitt Smith, the former Gator run-ning back and NFL Hall of Famer. There’s also a bit on the Florida-Georgia game, you should at least go to that if you aren’t going to go to home games, freshmen.
There was a lot of cool footage of 
“The Grove” at Ole Miss and a nice bit about the animosity between 
LSU and Ole Miss in football. I re-
ally enjoyed that because LSU is usually the odd-person out when talking about the natural rivals in the conference.
There was also a nod to Arkan-
sas’ old basketball arena, a place I didn’t know had such history and also allowed former coach Nolan 
Richardson some airtime, which is 
always great. 
Overall, I give “The Stars 
Aligned” an A, primarily because it had football in it and I am not a film reviewer. Look, I have a low bar for football-related entertain-ment, OK?
10:00 p.m. - 2:00 a.m.: Merciful-
ly, the SEC Network programmers have scheduled four hours of re-runs of the programming we’ve al-ready been over for the west coast viewers. This is like what happens when you have a double-block class and your professor lets you go early. Treasure these moments, freshmen. 
2:00 - 3:00 a.m.: As the 2009 SEC 
Championship game begins, we resume festivities and I’ve decided it’s story time. This game intersect-ed my life at one of the strangest weekends I’ve ever had.
Full disclosure: I’m from 
Gainesville, lived here every day of my 21 years. The night before this 
game was one of the better nights 
of my life.
I’m not a music guy, but at age 
16 I was obsessed with Kid Cudi. His first studio album had just come out, “Man on the Moon: The End of The Day,” and his mixtapes combined with that LP were the soundtrack for more than a few 
adolescent nights.
So Cudi did a free concert on 
campus at Flavet field the Friday 
night before this game, and it was absolutely awesome. My friends and I left school when at the end of the day, drove to campus and wait-ed out a cold rainy day to stand front row.
After it was over and we’d felt 
like we’d touched the face of God, we left on top of the world. Now our friend had an abandoned house next to her parent’s place, so as any group of dumb teenage boys, we decided it would be cool to spend the night in there. We had Smirnoff Ice and a hookah, it was freezing — 
by Florida standards — but it was 
awesome. 
The next day, the game was an 
afterthought because Florida had lost once in two seasons, it was go-ing to beat Alabama and Tebow was going to continue his march to college football immortality. 
After UF disposed of Bama, 
it would be time to find a way to grovel at my mother’s feet for a chance to buy a ticket to the na-tional championship game, but the Crimson Tide had other ideas for how that Saturday evening was go-ing to go. 
By Sunday morning coach Ur-
ban Meyer was in the hospital and 
nobody from Gainesville was go-
ing to get to go to Pasadena. But on the plus-side, I still don’t think my mom knows I broke and entered an abandoned residence. 
3:00 - 4:00 a.m.: As the final hour 
of Alabama-Florida plays, it is in many ways the end of one dynasty and the beginning of another. Mark 
Ingram would win the Heisman 
trophy seven days after this game ended, the Tide would win its first of three national championships in four years the following month. 
For Florida, within a year, a new 
man would be head coach and the program’s face would change from an offensive powerhouse led by 
Tebow to a defense-first Alabama 
lookalike. The Gators won a na-tional championship in the 2006 and 2008 seasons, and they came close to playing for another one un-
der Muschamp in 2011. 
Four short years after this game 
was played, Alabama had their 
fourth national championship un-der Nick Saban dashed only thanks to the miracle kick return of Chris Davis, and Florida didn’t even go to a bowl game. 
4:00 - 5:00 a.m.: The second of 
four straight recent-classic Ala-bama games begins to play and the conspiracy theorist in me knows the SEC offices are just a 90-minute drive from Tuscaloosa, Ala. Yes, I also know the SEC Network’s main hub is in Charlotte, N.C., but the mind wanders at 4:00 a.m. If I were you, freshmen, I’d consider taking 
the road trip to see the Gators play 
the Crimson Tide — it’s one you won’t forget.
Speaking of Birmingham, I’ve 
decided to switch gears and take a look at a replayed version of the soccer game pitting the University 
of Alabama at Birmingham’s game 
against Vanderbilt in an exhibition. The game wasn’t aired on SEC Net-work, but rather on its online com-panion SEC Network+. 
The webcast opens with play-
by-play men Kevin Ingram and Jeff Miller talking about the network and how many games it will broad-
cast.
The duo did fine especially early 
in the game setting up the tactics 
and playing styles of two teams participating. 
There wasn’t much explaining of 
the game, and that’s a good thing. There is a fine line between treating viewers like uncultured swine that 
have never watched a soccer game 
and talking too much above them, alienating a casual observer with too much technical jargon. 
They also got along well and seem to me like they’ve worked to-gether before, and I hope they do 
so again. 
5:00 - 6:00 a.m.: There was no 
halftime show, so as I entered the 
12th hour of this little endeavor, I watched still shots of scenery around Vanderbilt’s soccer stadium while listening to the PA announc-er go through some sort of contest between fans on the field.
Neither Miller nor Ingram talk 
over each other often. They also don’t talk too often — they’re just having a conversation about the game. 
They’re educated about soccer, 
but don’t do it in a way that’s con-descending to those that aren’t. 
Overall Grade: I’ll give the SEC 
Network’s first game telecast an A. No qualms here, or maybe I’m just too tired to tell?

VOLLEYBALL
IAN COHEN
Alligator Writer @ibcohen5
Rhamat Alhassan played basketball al-
most her entire life.
Just a few months ago, the 6-foot-4 fresh-
man from Glenarden, Md., was an athletic 
three-star recruit with long arms and a natu-ral ability to protect and score at the rim.
Ultimately, Florida’s newest and tallest 
addition opted to take the path less traveled, 
accepting a scholarship in an unfamiliar sport 
over her former forte.
“I kind of based it on (that) volleyball was 
a new year and I was less burnt out on it,” Alhassan said.
It was a tough and unexpected decision 
for the highly touted freshman, but a simple enough one for coach Mary Wise and the Gators.
“Rhamat could be playing basketball at 
a lot of places right now,” Wise said. “We’re very lucky she chose vol-leyball.”
Alhassan began playing 
volleyball her sophomore year at Academy of the Holy Cross. Even as a senior, she was relatively new to the sport and showed raw tal-
ent, but her seemingly un-
limited athletic potential 
caught the attention of Florida’s scouts.
“Dave Boos, our assistant head coach, was 
the ﬁ  rst one that saw her and texted us, ‘You 
won’t believe who’s in the gym,’” Wise said. “It was a phone call that night and he said, ‘Rhamat’s here, and she’s deﬁ  nitely going to be number one on our list.’ I said, ‘Oh so she’s that good?’”
 “Oh no, she doesn’t know anything about 
the game,” Boos replied.
While Alhassan’s lack of volleyball knowl-
edge is a downside for the Gators, her innate ability to learn on the ﬂ  y is just as imposing as her towering stature.
“What has been so impressive just in these 
ﬁ  rst few days is what a great learner she is,” Wise said. “Sometimes for players it takes them a while before that light comes on for them to learn and change skills and take it all in . . . every indication is (Alhassan) has great ability to learn.”
Despite her severe lack of playing experi-
ence, as a high school junior the lanky middle blocker used her athleticism and intellect to last until the ﬁ  nal round of cuts at the USA youth national team tryouts, all while com-peting alongside peers who had been playing volleyball since they were old enough to hit one.
A year later, Alhassan made the junior na-
tional team, carried USA to a Gold Medal and was named MVP.
The fact is, despite only playing the sport 
for a fraction of the time as the rest of her Florida teammates, Alhassan has already ac-complished far more.
However, there will be no shortage of 
challenges and rough patches this season as she continues to grow accustomed to volley-ball.
“The speed of the game will deﬁ  nitely be 
one of the biggest challenges for me, being able to move at that speed and getting used 
to it,” Alhassan said.
With her lack of experience comes a re-
sume that few collegiate players can repli-
cate, and that should undoubtedly help the 18-year old transition from playing under a basket to playing above a net.
“The summer after (Alhassan’s) junior 
year that she tried out for the youth national team, the fact that she even made one of the 
last cuts is incredible,” Wise said. “A year 
later, she’s the MVP.”
“When we talk about a learning curve, 
hers has been a straight line.”
