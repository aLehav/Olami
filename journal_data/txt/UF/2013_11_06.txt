New York City is raising the legal age to 
purchase tobacco products to 21, but Florida 
law is keeping Gainesville from setting its sights on similar legislation.
New York City’s City Council adopted the 
bill last Wednesday, and it will go into effect six months after Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg signs it. The limitations include all tobacco products, as well as electronic cigarettes.
Andrew Romero, a staff member of Tobac-
co Free Alachua, said the 1985 Florida Clean 
Indoor Air Act prevents more stringent re-strictions on smoking at the municipal level.
Romero, also a health policy specialist for 
the Alachua County Health Department, said 
the act prevents smoking in a workplace — but that leaves plenty of other places where smoking is legal.
“Let’s just say Gainesville wanted to re-
strict smoking in bars,” he said. “They actu-ally can’t.”
He said some Florida municipalities 
sought to ban smoking on beaches littered with cigarette butts, but they ran into trouble with the act blocking legislation.
“Basically, all these communities ﬁ  nd 
themselves stuck trying to clean up their towns or beaches,” he said.
As a result of this legislative roadblock, 
Gainesville has no policy in motion to raise the legal age to purchase tobacco, he said.

Two friends have decided to go the distance for 
Dance Marathon. That distance is about 120 miles 
— from Orlando to Gainesville.
Cody Lee, from the University of Central Flor-
ida, and Kevin Tayon, a 20-year-old UF business administration junior, are walking from Orlando’s Arnold Palmer Medical Center to UF Health Shands 
Hospital starting at daybreak Nov. 22, Tayon said. 
He said the duo plans to ﬁ  nish the walk by Nov. 26.
So far, Lee and Tayon have raised about $330. 
Their goal is $2,000, which Tayon said will mostly 
come from sponsors pledging a certain amount of 
money for each mile they walk.
Tayon said he and Lee decided to do the walk 
after Lee attempted it last year as a Valentine’s Day 
surprise for his girlfriend. He was unsuccessful be-
cause he tried to do it without sleep and became too exhausted.
When Lee approached Tayon about attempting 
the walk again, this time they wanted to do it for 
a cause.
“Dance Marathon was the easiest way to help 
people out and go on our walk,” Tayon said.
But they are also doing it for more than just 
Dance Marathon.
“As far as why we’re walking from Orlando to 
Gainesville, we’re symbolically bringing UCF and 
UF together,” he said.
He said both schools participate in Dance Mara-
thon, but there isn’t much else that unites the insti-tutions. In this way, they are uniting the two com-munities.
Tayon said he isn’t doing much to prepare him-
self physically for the journey. He used to run half-Students to walk

An hourlong showing of Soulfest 
will be added to the Homecoming Pa-
rade telecast this Friday.
The parade, aired on television for 
at least 27 years, is now approaching 10 
years of being streamed online, said Sue 
Wagner, director of community rela-tions for WUFT.
“Back then, people would come to 
the parade or sit at home and watch it. It was like a front seat to the parade,” she said.For the second year, a half-hour 
show called “Home,” which captures the UF experience, will air before the 
parade, said Reed Erickson, director of 
media services for WUFT.
The show of acts from Soulfest 2013 
will follow the parade, he said, and some of those acts will perform at Gator Growl.
He said Soulfest was added to the 
lineup to extend Homecoming coverage for people to watch.
“The extra hour allows a different 
part of Homecoming they normally wouldn’t get to see,” he said.
Erickson added that the production 
is mostly student-run. The crew and hosts of the preshow, parade coverage and Soulfest are mostly students of the UF journalism school.Friday's parade, Soulfest to stream online

Footprints Buddy and Support Program, 
a pediatric cancer volunteer organization, in 
partnership with the Gift of Life Bone Marrow Foundation may break a record for the amount of bone marrow donors swabbed this week.
“If we get over 1,000 people this year, then 
we’ll beat Ohio University, and we’ll have 
swabbed the most people on a campus ever,” 
said Rachel Werk, a 20-year-old UF behavior and cognitive neuroscience junior and co-di-rector of the drive.
The organizations are registering poten-
tial donors today and Thursday at the Reitz Union, Turlington Plaza, Plaza of the Ameri-cas, and the UF Health Shands Hospital Sun Terrace. 
The process includes a registration form 
and a cheek swab. Registrants have a one in a 1,000 chance of being matched with a donor.
Grifﬁ  n Plattner, a 20-year-old UF chemi-
cal engineering and business administration 
junior and an ofﬁ  cer of Footprints, said 80 per-
cent of the time, donors only have to undergo a noninvasive surgery.
UF has matched 24 students in the last 
three years of the drive, Plattner said.

who is in an otherwise terminal situation,” he said.Bone marrow drive hopes to break records, build registry

saw something that caught her eye: a man walking with a tray of eggs on his head.
“He saw us with our cameras and was 
trying to kind of pose for us,” said the 20-year-old UF public relations senior.
Moore’s shot recently took second 
place in the UF Global Culture Photo Contest study abroad and service learn-ing students category.
The exhibit is now open at the UF

Rob Witzel, photo editor for The

Witzel, who teaches a UF lighting

Aspiring musicians can now compete for 
professional critiques using social media.
Grammy U’s Ampliﬁ  er Center Stage 
launched Tuesday. The new social media plat-
form invites artists to create a proﬁ  le and up-
load their music to grammyuampliﬁ  er.com via 
SoundCloud, program spokesman Peter Kadin wrote in an email.
Finalists will be given an opportunity to 
have their music critiqued by a panel of leading names in music. Participants can promote their entries on social media to get votes, Kadin said. Submissions are due Dec. 10. 
The top-rated proﬁ  les will be linked to the 
program’s curators — Linkin Park, Kelly Clark-son, Ozzy Osbourne, Rza, Kaskade, My Morn-ing Jacket’s Jim James and Snoopzilla, formerly known as Snoop Dogg — who will promote the 
artists on their own social media accounts.
The top three acts will receive awards like a 
recording session with a Grammy producer.
“The program will help ﬁ  ll a void left of art-
ist and repertoire operations at record compa-
nies and allow college students to share their music directly with top musicians,” Jodie Blum, the executive director of Grammy U, wrote in an email.
Spencer Jordan, a 19-year-old UF English 
and family, youth and community sciences sophomore, said the program sounds like something he would like to participate in.
“Gainesville is already a great town for as-
piring musicians, but this gives us an opportu-nity to reach outside of our university with our music and have it heard by people who have more experience and invaluable knowledge in 
the industry,” he said.Contest gives musicians notes“If we get over 1,000 people this

CRIME
KATHRYN VARN
Alligator Staff Writer kvarn@alligator.org
In Monday’s crime logs, police 
reported one Gainesville man sold 
his ex-girlfriend’s stolen posses-
sions to neighbors, and another lo-
cal woman hit the father of her chil-
dren with a coffee pot.
In the first incident, 45-year-old 
Lee Morris Fomby had recently ended a relationship with his girl-friend of five years, Deann Merriex, according to a GPD arrest report.
While Merriex was moving out 
of the apartment she and Fomby previously shared, 2626 E. Uni-versity Ave., Fomby took two air 
conditioning units, a freezer, two 
dressers and a Crock-Pot, among other items.
He then hosted what a witness 
referred to as an “open house” and 
sold Merriex’s possessions, accord-
ing to the report.During questioning, Fomby told 
police he gave the dressers away, and someone had stolen the other items.
Fomby was arrested on charges 
of grand theft and dealing in stolen property. He was booked into the Alachua County Jail, where he re-mained as of press time in lieu of a $20,000 bond.
…
Jasmine Leilani Myrick, 24, showed up to the Sunoco gas station at 528 NW Eighth Ave. to pick up child support money from Nazmul Hossain, who works at the store, ac-cording to a GPD arrest report.
The two started arguing about 
Hossain’s current relationship. It escalated to the point where Myrick threw a hot coffee pot at Hossain. It 
missed his head by several inches.
Myrick then slapped and hit 
Hossain several times, according to the report.
During questioning, Myrick ad-
mitted to throwing the coffee pot 
but told police she could not re-member hitting Hossain.
Officers arrested Myrick on 
charges of aggravated assault, bat-tery and criminal mischief. She was booked into the Alachua County 
Jail and was released just before 
noon Tuesday on her own recogni-zance.Recent arrests: Gainesville yard sale steal, coffee pot assault

Sexting and digital abuse among 
teenagers and young people has de-
clined.
The Associated Press-NORC Cen-
ter for Public Affairs Research and 
MTV recently released a study con-
cluding that 49 percent of the 1,297 people sampled had experienced at least one type of digital abuse. This contrasted with 56 percent in 2011.
But UF social psychologist Grego-
ry Webster said that after reviewing the survey, there may have been er-rors in the sample.
He said the sample does not reflect 
the true population, and the decline is not significant.
“Those declines are within the 
margin of error,” Webster said.
Although the survey is valid, he 
said, the results are not dramatically different from the 2011 results.
But he said sexting and digital 
abuse are still problems. With apps like Snapchat that allow easy photo sharing and websites that allow the ability to tag people in pictures, young people forget to consider the long-term effects of inappropriate photos.
“People underestimate the perma-
nence of the Internet,” Webster said.
Digital abuse included writing 
mean or untrue messages on people’s Internet pages or looking at people’s text messages without their permis-sion.Sexting among teens and young 
people has also declined, according to the survey. In 2013, 26 percent had sexted compared to 32 percent in 2011.
The survey examined people ages 
14 to 24.
UF sociology lecturer Sophia 
Krzys Acord said Internet users of-ten view their offline lives as separate from their online profiles, and young adults are not fully aware of the con-sequences of inappropriate photo sharing.
“It can come back to bite us,” she 
said.
Jennifer Klein, a UF doctoral can-
didate of criminology, said sexting can have serious legal consequences.
She said if an adult engages in 
sexting with a minor, the adult could face child pornography charges.
She said Florida and some other 
states have begun to enact more le-nient disciplinary measures toward minors. The first offense may not even land a misdemeanor, but the second could and the third could mean a felony charge.
Jenna Bilodeau, a 20-year-old UF 
neurobiological sciences and microbi-ology and cell science junior, said she thinks people could be haunted by bad photos for the rest of their lives.
She said after a high school friend 
was the victim of revenge porn — posting explicit photos online as a way to humiliate someone — she thinks young people should be more conscious of their online actions.
A decline in sexting might be at-
tributed to increased awareness, Bilo-deau said.
“People realize that it has such an 
impact later on in life,” she said.Sexting on decline, but 
it's still on UF’s mindUF remains tobacco-free campus
atory freshman, said  because 
she is asthmatic, she would rather her peers not use tobac-co at all but does not think ban-ning the products from young 
adults would do much to solve 
the problem.
“People under 21 will either 
just leave the city or seek illegal methods to obtain tobacco,” Nolen said.  
Nolen said she feels higher 
taxes on tobacco products would be a more effective 
method to decrease the use of 
tobacco.
Increasing the minimum 
age to purchase tobacco prod-ucts in Florida is unlikely, and electronic cigarettes remain un-regulated in Gainesville.According to a study by the 
Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, the percentage of 
high school and middle school students using e-cigarettes has more than doubled, with an es-timated  1.78 million students having tried them in 2012.
Romero said there are initia-
tives in motion locally to regu-late e-cigarettes like traditional 
cigarettes, with a minimum 
purchase age of 18.
Regardless of Gainesville’s 
stance on either product, UF policy still prohibits students from using both e-cigarettes and tobacco products on cam-pus.
Florida Bridgewater-Alford, 
UF campus communications outreach director, said the ban was instituted after a Student Government referendum for a smoke-free campus was sup-
ported by 64 percent of nearly 
10,000 votes.
Although the ban earned a 
majority vote from students, some are unhappy about the lack of freedom to smoke on campus.
Matt Libanoff, a 20-year-
old UF advertising junior, said 
he understands the ban is for 
ecological and health reasons but said it feels a little unnec-essary.
Libanoff said he enjoyed oc-
casionally smoking on campus up until the anti-smoking signs came up.
“It was just part of my walk-
to-class routine,” he said.

Local artists and volunteers put 
some of the finishing touches on a 
carbon-neutral, gator-shaped pa-rade float made from repurposed materials Tuesday night in prepara-
tion for UF’s Homecoming Parade.
After about two months of con-
struction, the 20-foot, bicycle-pow-ered gator is almost ready to hit the 
streets.
A bicyclist sitting within the 
papier-mache walls of the float will be able to move a lever to make the gator’s mouth open and close as it rolls down University Avenue. Its legs will move along with the ped-als.
The float is part of a new joint ef-
fort among local artists, volunteers, and the Alachua County sustain-ability and waste alternatives offices to engage the bicycling community 
and show what can be made from 
reclaimed materials.
The idea started last year when 
local artists Raymond Rawls and Lorraine Duerden decided to create a large, pedal-powered, fish-shaped float with a moveable fin. An im-proved version of that float will join the gator in this year’s parade.
Rawls said he was inspired to 
create the floats because he wanted 
to see more creativity in the parade 
and see the bicycle section stand out.
“We’re hoping to make the bike 
part kind of the anticipated part of the parade,” Rawls said.
He said he thought it could be a 
“nice little break from all of the car exhaust” bystanders breathe in.
Bicyclists from local organiza-
tions and unicyclists from UF’s jug-gling club Objects in Motion will ride alongside the float.
The majority of the materials 
used to create the float are repur-posed items that would have oth-erwise ended up in a landfill, said Alachua County waste alternative 
specialist Fae Nageon de Lestang. 
Reclaimed bicycles, lumber, par-ticle board, cardboard and paint for the project were collected from the county’s Leveda Brown Environ-
mental Park and Transfer Station.
“I think it sends a beautiful mes-
sage that they’ve taken things that 
were literally on their way out and turned them into a piece of art that our whole community can enjoy,” Nageon de Lestang said.
Rawls said he and Duerden plan 
to create another float next year. 
About 30 community members 
participated in the construction of this year’s float.
Among the volunteers were 
Gainesville City Commissioner Randy Wells and his son.
Wells said he appreciated the 
creativity that went into the float’s design and construction.
“They’ve put a lot of heart into 
it,” he said.
The Gator Float
>> About 30 people worked to design, construct, papier mache and 
paint the float.
>> More than 90 percent of the float is made of repurposed materials.
>> Two commissioners will bike alongside the float: Mike Byerly, chair 
of Alachua County Board of County Commissioners, and Randy Wells, a 
Gainesville city commissioner.
Alachua County Waste Stream
>> Five hundred to 700 tons of waste are produced in Alachua County 
every day.
>> Alachua County has the highest recycling rate in the state — 55 per -
cent of all trash in Alachua County as of the last fiscal year.

Lochte injured by fan
Poor Ryan Lochte can’t catch a break — he’s forever in Mi-
chael Phelps’ shadow, his acting career was short-lived with just a guest part on “90210” and a few “Funny or 
Die” videos, people only cared about his reality show for about ﬁ  ve minutes, and the shoes he designed for Nike are hopelessly 
ugly.
Now, the swimmer and Gator alumnus will be taking a 
break from swimming as he recovers from a torn MCL and 
sprained ACL after a “freak injury caused by an unexpected fan encounter,” USA Today reported Tuesday.
According to a statement from his publicist, “Ryan . . . will 
be taking a break from training and competition. His medical team expects him to make a full and speedy recovery and Ryan thanks everyone for their well wishes.”
The fan reportedly saw Lochte and — rather than spending 
10 minutes debating with her friends, ﬁ  nally working up the nerve, slinking over to him and nervously asking for his auto-graph like a normal person — ran at him. Lochte caught her, but the impact caused him to fall and bang his leg against a street curb. The girl was unharmed.
We have many concerns over the state of Lochte’s toned, 
carved-from-marble legs. How will this injury affect his ability to “turn it up”? Will the lack of a constant endorphin rush cause 
him to “jeah” less and less, until he’s nothing more than a hol-
low shell of a man?
Our only hope is that Lochte will use this downtime to con-
tinue churning out quality tweets. Lochte has, arguably, one of the most iconic Twitter presences of the athletic world.
Some of our favorites:“Always reach for the moon cuz if u slip up u will still be a 
star!! #Jeah”
“Rocks, paper, siccor.......”
“Wake up and smell the gardens”
But we’re still so worried! How badly will this set him back 
during his training for the 2016 Olympics in Rio? Will this forced hiatus affect the production and sales of his Pool Water line of fragrances for men? Will Fat Daddy’s revenue plummet with the loss of Lochte’s business now that he’s an invalid?
Only time — and Lochte, via succinct and grammatically 
questionable tweets — will tell.
We’re conﬁ  dent that Lochte, being the misunderstood intel-
lectual he is, will make good use of his free time.
Maybe he’ll get the chance to revive his acting career — on 
the big screen, this time. He has the kind of all-American, corn-fed, vacant hotness that cries out for a role as the vanilla love interest in a Nicholas Sparks ﬁ  lm adaptation.
We can see it now: As his equally vanilla female co-star leans 
over his hospital bed with tears in her eyes, he ﬂ  ips a sideways peace sign, grins and says, “This cancer diagnosis can’t turn down my swag, #jeah.”
On the serious, we love Ryan Lochte — completely unironi-
cally. He’s a Gainesville icon, and we wish him a speedy and painless recovery.

calories?Today’s question: Are you going to watch the 
Homecoming Parade?Being human means having dignity
Swedish writer Henning Mankell described an 
emaciated, young boy he once saw walking abnor-mally slow down a village road in Africa.
“I noticed something that I will never forget for as 
long as I live,” he said. “I looked at his feet. He had no shoes. Instead he had painted shoes on his feet. He had used the colors in the ground and in the roots to replace 
his shoes.”
“He had come up with a way to keep his dignity,” 
Mankell said.
The boy, who was a victim in Mozambique’s bru-
tal civil war some 25 years ago, is probably dead now, Mankell said.
We forget there are only a few differences between 
us — Homo sapiens — and our jungle friends. One of 
those is that strange concept of “dignity.”
“The unexamined life is not worth living,” Socrates 
said. We rarely wonder, “Why do humans in hot cli-mates wear clothes? Why do we — even atheists — give such moving memorials to lifeless dead bodies? Why do we lie and exaggerate about ourselves?”
The answer to those questions is often simple: to pre-
serve our basic dignity.
Without dignity, there’s no point of being human. 
And no matter how hopeless someone becomes, you 
can never take away a person’s dignity — the human is 
too resilient a creature.
There is one person in Gainesville who gets this 
whole “dignity” thing. Her name is Rebecca Brown.
She founded the Streetlight program at Shands. Vol-
unteers in the program work to form supportive rela-tionships with critical and chronically ill adolescents. Some patients are close to death while others live with pain and depression. In restoring a “sense of normalcy 
while they are dealing with their illness,” Brown and 
her team aim to preserve the dignity of the suffering.
Befriending a chronically ill patient is often more meaningful than “lifesaving” medical intervention. 
But there is still something 
uncomfortable about sitting on the bedside of a girl with cystic ﬁ  brosis whose persistent cough indicates death is imminent. 
But in shunning her, we only 
shun ourselves.
In just a few years, reality will hit home. We’re quite weak. Not just weak but also dependent. 
Our joints will creak, and our legs will quiver. Walk-
ing will be a feat, and running laps will only happen in 
dreams. 
And at that point, we will realize there’s more to life 
than trying to add a few more years to our earthly visit 
through surgical procedures.
The African boy I mentioned earlier was dying, but 
he spent his remaining moments painting his feet. The 
sickly teens in Streetlight aren’t looking for more drugs or hospital stays. They’re searching for a friend’s hand.
They realized there is more to life than the calendar 
years we live. 
They fought to keep their dignity.Getting involved in social work is en vogue these 
days. There is a simple way to determine if that activ-ism actually has any meaning: Does it restore human dignity?
Ensuring that fellow man’s self-respect is preserved 
doesn’t have to come through joining some huge relief 
effort. We all have friends and family members whose 
dignity has waned, and they’re waiting for our hand. 
Go help. Remember, a time will come when you, too, will be 
waiting for someone’s help.

Two weeks ago, I wrote a column about 
Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) advocating the use of misinformation and deception 
during a speech to University of Louisville medical students. Paul explained to the stu-
dents that he would often spread false rumors 
about upcoming exams among his classmates and claimed that misinformation can be “a great tactic.”
Now, it seems that Paul has added a new 
tactic to his bag of dishonest tricks: plagia-rism.
According to The New York Times,  the 
senator has been accused of plagiarizing parts 
of one of his speeches from the Wikipedia 
entry for the science ﬁ  ction movie “Gattaca.” Paul was attempting to connect the movie, in which the human population has been ge-netically engineered to eliminate undesirable characteristics, to the policies of progressives and liberals.
The speech contained two sentences de-
scribing the movie that were virtually identi-
cal to portions of the Wikipedia article.
This is not the ﬁ  rst time Paul has come un-
der suspicion of plagiarism. BuzzFeed uncov-
ered another speech by the senator where he appeared to plagiarize information from the Wikipedia page for the 1988 ﬁ  lm “Stand and Deliver.”
On Monday, the extent of Paul’s plagiarism 
was revealed to be much deeper than initially 
realized. According to Mediaite, the senator lifted more than 1,300 unaltered 
words of his 2013 book, “Govern-ment Bullies,” from a 2003 Heri-tage Foundation study. 
Paul has attempted to justify 
his actions by claiming he gave appropriate credit. “We borrowed the plot lines from Gattaca,” he said. “I gave credit to the people who wrote the movie,” he said in an interview with Fusion. The co-author also denied the allegations of plagiarism in “Government Bullies,” claiming all of the in-formation was properly sourced in the book’s 
endnotes.
Neither of the excuses provided by the 
senator and his staff is valid. In order to actu-
ally not have committed plagiarism, the sena-tor should have credited the source of the plot summary — Wikipedia — and not simply ac-knowledge the existence of the movie. Paul’s failure to quote the Heritage Foundation’s words within the actual text of his book is also 
a clear-cut, indisputable example of plagia-
rism.
Paul’s denial of plagiarism leaves two 
possibilities: Either he was deliberately lying about his actions, or he simply does not un-derstand what plagiarism is. Paul’s plagiarism is even more disturbing in light of his libertar-ian political philosophy. During Paul’s tenure in the Senate, he has been a forceful advocate 
against the social safety net, drafting a budget proposal that would eviscerate 
social programs like Medicare, Medicaid and food stamps.
Paul’s opposition to govern-
ment social programs falls largely 
in lockstep with the perspective 
of Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wi.), a Tea Party hero and chairman of the House Budget Committee. Ryan frequently portrays Americans 
who rely on government programs like food stamps to make ends meet as lazy, unedu-cated “takers” who are wholly dependent on “makers” — i.e., business owners — for their 
survival.
Paul champions a political ideology that 
claims to value initiative, independence and 
personal responsibility. Despite these beliefs, Paul added uncredited, plagiarized material to his speeches, effectively stealing from the individuals who put time and effort into writ-ing the Wikipedia articles and the Heritage Foundation study.
Even worse, the senator failed to take 
responsibility for his actions when the pla-giarism was discovered, instead choosing to dodge the question and blame “haters” for the accusations. In addition to the dishonesty of  Paul’s plagiarism, the point he was seeking to make about liberal policies leading to eugenics is completely inaccurate.
Progressives and liberals believe every in-
dividual should be given the greatest possible opportunity to succeed on his or her own mer-it. They also believe government can play an important role in “leveling the playing ﬁ  eld” by ensuring all citizens have access to basic ne-cessities such as health care, food and afford-
able education.
Progressives also advocate for a strong 
social safety net to ensure society collectively 
helps those who are unable to help them-selves.
Paul’s libertarian philosophy takes exactly 
the opposite approach. Libertarians hold that government should have little, if any, involve-ment in the lives of its citizens. They oppose 
safety net programs and believe individuals 
should be left to fend for themselves. The phi-losophy portrayed in “Gattaca” is far closer to this kind of social Darwinist, “survival of the ﬁ  ttest” mentality than to progressive ideol-ogy.
By itself, Paul’s plagiarism is not cause for 
serious condemnation. Politicians across the spectrum, including both President Barack 
Obama and Vice President Joe Biden, have 
been accused of giving speeches with uncred-ited information at one time or another. How-ever, the hypocrisy of the senator’s plagiarism,  given his belief in personal responsibility and initiative combined with his complete misun-derstanding of the information from which he plagiarized, is shameful.

relations junior. His column runs on Wednesdays.

“I’m ready for Hillary.” One often hears and sees 
this pitiful catchphrase among “liberal” friends and on social media — as if the 2008 presiden-
tial election was only the ﬁ  rst installment in an ongo-ing Democratic drama. This mindless slogan should 
be bothersome for two reasons: One, it insinuates 
that Clinton is in fact seeking the Democratic nomination in the 2016 election, and two, it signals a recognition of the supreme dominance of the political class. That is to say, the stage was already set in 2008. The actors have been chosen.
It should be noted that I by no means aim to criticize Hillary 
Clinton — just those who support her.Recently, New York Sen. Chuck Schumer “pre-
endorsed” Clinton for the Democratic nomination. It is both odd and revealing that a senior U.S. senator would feel endorse someone who is not yet an of-ﬁ  cial candidate. It signals what we all already know: 
Hillary is running for president in 2016.
This unfortunate and inevitable fact could not better dem-
onstrate how anti-democratic our election process is. For one, 
consider the fact that if Hillary were to be elected, over the course of thirty years, four out of ﬁ  ve presidents would belong to two families. If the United States actually embodied demo-cratic values, in a country of more than 300 million people, this trend would be impossible. However, in the United States, this reality seems all too probable.
Even with the fact that Clinton is a former ﬁ  rst lady aside, 
her presence as leading contender in 2016 is still disturbing.
As far as I can see, there is no internal criticism of the Demo-
cratic platform. Therefore, to support Clinton is a tacit endorse-ment of the policies of the Obama administration. There has been no debate on these issues. Rather, Democrats can easily rally their supporters and usher Clinton into the Oval Ofﬁ  ce under the simple slogan: “At least we’re not Republicans!”

Susanna Card stared at more than 
400 labeled jugs of dried herbs lining 
the walls of Otter & Trout Trading Co., searching for her remedy.
“I’ve tried prescription drugs, but 
nothing’s ever worked,” said Card, a nurse who suffers from asthmatic bronchitis. “I tried these herbs, and I wouldn’t go a day without them.”
Many people like Card have 
come to rely on herbal remedies. But buyers may not be getting what they think.A study BMC Medicine released 
in October investigated 12 undis-closed herbal supplement compa-nies. It found one-third of the 44 bottles tested did not contain a trace of the herb they claimed, and most 
contained fillers.
Paul Doering, a UF pharmaco-
therapy and translational research 
professor, said he was not surprised by the findings.
“I have long felt that the lack 
of regulation has meant that there could be anything in these prod-ucts,” said Doering, “or in this case, 
nothing at all.”He said under the Dietary Sup-
plement Health and Education Act 
of 1994, the herbal supplement in-dustry has enjoyed little to no regu-lation from the Food and Drug Ad-ministration.
“I think in a lot of ways, the in-
dustry is sort of caught with its pants down,” Doering said, “and this is probably going to give the FDA the ammunition they need to finally put their teeth into some regulations.”
The DNA barcoding used by the 
group of Canadian researchers who conducted the study was not always 
available, Doering said, so qual-ity control for herbal supplements 
hasn’t been easy.
Eric Rummler, the co-owner of 
Otter & Trout, said his business de-pends on the sales of herbs, and he emphasized the importance of an 
educated consumer.
“Every time someone tells me 
they’re taking an herb, I ask them 
to bring in the bottle,” he said, “and most of the time there’s only 1 or 2 percent of the actual herb in there.”
Doering recommended that any-
one interested in an herbal approach 
should take the time to educate 
themselves on what they are taking.
“If you’re putting your health 
in something’s hands, you should approach it with a healthy dose of skepticism,” he said.8, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 6, 2013

Mobiquity, a Boston-based mobile 
software company that expanded to 
Gainesville in May, recently announced it will expand by upping its office space and number of employees locally.
The company will jump from a 
1,700-square-feet location to 4,000 square feet in the Innovation Square community by the end of the year.
It will also hire 30 more employees in 
the next few months. It will double the workforce, as the 
Gainesville office currently employs 28, according to a news release.
“There are a lot of people ready to do 
very big things in Gainesville,” Daniel Co-hen, development director at Mobiquity, said in a statement. “It feels great to be a part of building a thriving tech community here in Gainesville.”
Mobiquity is working with local prop-
erty developer and manager Trimark Properties to facilitate these expansions in office space.
Josh Steppling, Trimark Properties commercial marketing and communica-tions director, said Trimark has worked with Mobiquity to renovate the space in the new building the company is moving into.
Bryce Sperling, a 20-year-old UF com-
puter science engineering junior, said new tech companies like Mobiquity joining the 
Gainesville community provides a great 
opportunity to students.
“Now, they have somewhere where 
right when they leave school, they have an automatic in,” he said.
Steppling also said Mobiquity is in the 
process of developing training programs with UF and other local organizations. 
More information will be available in 
the months to come, he said. Innovation Square company plans to double office space, workersSTATE

A beached sperm whale was eu-
thanized last week in Madeira Beach 
after a UF veterinarian played an in-strumental role in the decision.
The animal’s thin body and loca-
tion signaled that it was chronically ill, said Mike Walsh, a clinical as-sociate professor and co-director of Aquatic Animal Health at UF.
“Because it was so sick and the 
way it looked visually, it wouldn’t have served any purpose to tow the animal back out,” Walsh said.More than 
40 people were involved in the decision to eutha-nize the whale, including the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conser-vation Commis-sion, the National 
Marine Fisheries Service and UF.  
Those involved in the decision 
to euthanize the whale wanted to make sure it was done in a humane way. The whale was given a pow-erful sedative at 2 p.m. to ease its pain. After 30 minutes, potassium 
chloride was pumped into its chest, 
Walsh said.
“People also need to realize that 
as veterinarians, we don’t take an animal’s life easily,” Walsh said.  “We want to make sure we’re doing it for the right reasons.”
Alejandro Grau, a 22-year-old UF 
agricultural and biological engineer-
ing senior on the pre-vet track, said 
he supports euthanization if it is the most humane option.
“If they can prove it would stop 
the suffering, in my opinion, it was adequate,” Grau said.

Alachua County Fire Rescue Services is once 
again urging people to change the batteries in their 
fire alarms and carbon monoxide detectors.
Associating changing batteries with daylight 
saving time is a good way to ensure safety, said Mark Smith, the AFR fire marshal. He said the fire rescue runs the Change Your Clock, Change Your 
Batteries campaign twice a year.
“Realistically, people don’t test the systems as 
frequently as they should,” said Smith, 44.
People who have a working smoke alarm in their house have a 50 percent greater chance of sur-
viving a fire, Smith said.  
“Smoke is what kills in a fire,” Smith said.Thierry Bizimungu, a 19-year-old software engi-
neer at Daring Development Inc., recalled a house fire incident that happened about two years ago. Bizimungu said while cooking, flames and smoke billowed into the air, and the fire alarm went off.
With the help of his brother, Bizimungu slapped 
the flames out with a cloth. He said he doesn’t know how the story would have changed if the alarm hadn’t sounded.
Smith said residents should also rehearse a 
home escape plan, which includes designating a safe meeting place outside.
“It only takes one survival for that to be a suc-
cess,” Smith said. “One life saved is immeasur-able.”Fire rescue says it’s time to change

After passing a few resolutions that 
have been lingering on the agenda, sena-
tors brainstormed improvements for the school year at Tuesday night’s Student Senate meeting.
Senators jump-started the meeting by 
unanimously approving four bills within their ﬁ  rst reading: a resolution honoring the late history professor Alan Cecil Pe-tigny, an amendment to the Student Body Constitution’s anti-discrimination policy, funding for Generation Sketch Comedy and the Student Organization Fundraising Bill.
Most of Tuesday’s meeting hinged on 
a legislative agenda presented by Senate President Cory Yeffet and Senate Presi-dent Pro-Tempore Elliot Grasso. 
After the uproar of Fall elections sub-
side, it is customary for the Senate execu-tive pair to present a plan for the school year.
“We’re gonna accomplish some incred-
ible things in this PowerPoint presenta-tion,” Yeffet said.
The plan outlined Yeffet’s external vi-
sion of community service within Senate committees and additional opportunities for constituency.
Later in the meeting, each committee 
chair presented ideas for community ser-vice, ranging from Budget and Appropria-tions Committee Chairman Sen. Joseph Michaels’ work with Ronald McDonald House Charities to Sen. Dylan Fisher’s idea of playing with kittens and puppies 
at the Humane Society.
“What I’ve done with Senate exec is 
challenge them to have community events to show that we care about the communi-
ty,” Yeffet said.
The plan’s internal vision included pro-
fessionalism inside and outside the Senate chambers and accountability among sena-tors by following through with resolutions and planned events.
Yeffet also formed a temporary Rules 
and Procedures Committee to include ini-tiatives such as the new senator orienta-tion series. 
The committee will include six mem-
bers, a minority party leader, majority party leader and Sen. Susan Webster as an appointed chairperson.
Within the campus improvements 
portion of the presentation, Yeffet and Grasso’s plan also included streamlining student organization proﬁ  ts, which went hand in hand with Student Body Treasurer Jayce Victor and Michaels’ Student Orga-
nization Fundraising Bill.
The bill changes the language of the 
ﬁ  nancial codes to discourage student or-
ganizations from opening outside bank ac-counts. Victor said these external accounts can conﬂ  ict with the Internal Revenue Ser-vice’s audits of UF.
Michaels said clarifying the language in 
the bill is “something that a lot of student 
organizations, especially sports groups, 
have been asking for for a while.”
Sen. Michael Christ commended Grasso 
and Yeffet on their plan.WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 6, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 9

Students hailing from mid-Florida may recognize a new ad-
dition to the Gainesville restaurant scene.
Tampa-based Yummy House opened in Gainesville last 
month.
At noon Tuesday, all but one of the 24 tables were ﬁ  lled at 
the location at 7605 W. Newberry Road, next to Wafﬂ  e House.
“Right now, the parking lot is full, and this is just how 
things look when it’s slow,” said Sarah Ma, supervisor of the 
restaurant.The restaurant is in need of new employees, especially UF 
students, Ma said. Many of the current employees are from Tampa, where the chain originated.
The brown- and cream-colored building was home to Ken-tucky Fried Chicken before Yummy House took over.
Antonisha Williams, a 21-year-old UF theater senior, said 
she isn’t surprised.
“KFC isn’t as popular as it used to be,” she said. “Almost 
everyone loves trying out new places, and if Yummy House is good, then it’ll become the new hot spot.”
But Deborah Alberto, a 20-year-old UF political science ju-
nior, said she thinks there are already enough Chinese restau-rants around town.
“That area is really congested,” she said. “I don’t know how 
they managed to squeeze another Chinese restaurant over there.”Tampa-based Chinese restaurant ﬁ  nds home in Gainesville

Sebastien Rousseau 
is looking to add to his impressive college career. Read the story on page 14. Lochte injured

When Trenton Brown 
signed with Florida last 
winter, he expected to make 
a contribution equal to his 
size.
But seven games into his 
college career, he remained 
on the sideline, watching his 
teammates surrender sack after drive-killing sack.
“It was kind of frustrat-
ing,” Brown said.
But against Georgia on 
Saturday, Brown finally got a chance to make a big impact.
The junior transfer out 
of Georgia Military College 
made his first Division I start 
against the Bulldogs and drew praise from his coaches and teammates.“He did a good job in the 
game,” offensive coordinator Brent Pease said. “There’s a couple things we’ve got to 
clean up. I think he’s good 
now that he’s had some of those been-in-a-game situ-ations. I think he’ll get bet-
ter.”
Brown started at right 
tackle in redshirt sophomore 
Tyler Moore’s place while Moore moved to left tackle, replacing injured sophomore D.J. Humphries (knee). The new offensive-line combina-
tion surrendered four sacks 
against Georgia but looked better against the pass rush than it had in previous 
weeks.
“They gave me time,” 
quarterback Tyler Murphy 
said. “They were able to open up some holes for the 
running backs. I thought 
they played well.”
Brown’s strength on the 
line is his sheer size. The 
6-foot-8, 360-pound lineman 
has the mass to block any blitzing defender. Brown said he inherited the size from his family.
“My dad is 6-7, and my 
mom’s dad is 6-7,” he said. “I’ve heard that you get your size from your mom’s side of 
the family, so I guess I would 
have kind of nice size either way.”
Brown almost utilized 
his height in another sport. Before focusing on football, he said he played basketball well enough to garner schol-
arship offers from mid-major 
Division I schools such as Jacksonville State, Old Do-minion and South Carolina 
State. 
“If I dropped about 60 
pounds, I could still get after 
it,” he said. “I’ve still got the game.
“Before I gained that, I 
could windmill (dunk). When I was 285, I could windmill.”
But the weight he added 
between his freshman year

Accusations of using threats of violence 
and racial slurs against teammate Jonathan 
Martin caused Miami Dolphins offensive lineman Richie Incognito to be suspended from the team this week. 
The incident has generated consider-
ation as to what behavior is acceptable in the NFL and in locker rooms across the country.
For Florida linebacker 
Michael Taylor, the key to not crossing the line is maintaining respect for 
teammates. 
“I’m all for the jokes, 
all for playing. You’ve just got to know the per-sonality of a player, and you’ve just got to know 
what you can do, what you can say to a person and treat everybody with respect,” Taylor said Tuesday. 
“Everybody’s got a different level of 
comfortability about what you can say about them and how to approach them. You’ve just got to know your teammates. That’s my main thing with me, just re-specting your teammates and knowing what you can do and what you can say to who.”
It remains unclear to what extent Mar-
tin was harassed by Incognito, who has 
denied involvement in the situation. Sev-
eral reports include descriptions of the 24-year-old rookie facing bullying, hazing and monetary demands. 
Tyler Moore said Tuesday that Florida 
teammates will “make fun of guys if they do certain things, did something stupid or said something a little fun or something Gators shocked 
by Dolphins’ 
bullying issue

Casey Prather had a humble beginning to his Florida 
career.
In his first start for the Gators as a freshman on Feb. 20, 
2011, Prather took two shots and missed both.
He grabbed three rebounds, but one was from his own 
shot. 
He started, but six Gators still had more time on the 
court than he did.
But after three seasons of averaging 3.1 points and 2.1 rebounds per game, Prather transformed 
into the Gators’ go-to playmaker on both 
sides of the ball during Florida’s 110-88 
victory against Florida Southern during an exhibition game Friday night.
Not only did the senior forward 
make 8 of 10 shots for a game-leading 23 
points, but he also led all players on the 
court with seven assists and four steals.
Prather showcased his newfound confidence and ag-
gressiveness fewer than four minutes into the game when he took the ball up the court, faked a pass to Kasey Hill on the wing and split two defenders in the lane for a one-
handed dunk.
Although Prather started at forward, he brought the 
ball up the court several times throughout the night and 
mostly drove the lane. 
Six of his eight made field goals were either layups or 
dunks.
Hill, who started the game at point guard, had only 
three assists.Prather assuming larger scoring role for depleted Floridasee bR own, p Age 15

Sebastien Rousseau is a two-time NCAA champion, 10-time 
All-American and two-time South African Olympian. 
But there is still more to come. 
Before the Olympics, college and even high school, Rous-
seau was just a kid with a dream.
“My dad actually told me this story a couple years ago,” 
Rousseau said. “They asked the people at his work to go home and ask their kids what they want to do when they grow up, and I said, ‘I want to swim for South Africa in the Olympics.’”
He realized that dream at the Beijing Olympics in 2008 when 
the 17-year-old from Cape Town, South Africa, made his debut in the Water Cube — the same pool in which Michael Phelps won his record-setting eight gold medals — for the 800-meter freestyle relay. He served as the anchor in his ﬁ  rst Olympic 
swim and posted a time of 1:50.46 in preliminaries. It was good 
enough for the No. 8 seed in the ﬁ  nals, where he dropped near-ly a second off his previous time coming in at 1:49.55. His relay team would go on to ﬁ  nish eighth in the event ﬁ  nals. 
“It was crazy,” Rousseau said. “Beijing was such a crazy 
experience. Obviously London was amazing, too, but nobody can put on a spectacle like the Chinese can.“It was just such a huge event and walking out onto the 
pool deck and having people go crazy was amazing.”
Less than a year later, the top-rated and highly touted recruit 
made a 10-day recruiting trip to America to look at schools. 
Coach Gregg Troy persuaded him to swim at Florida.“He’s just very open with me, and I like that,” Rousseau 
said. “He reminds me of my coach (Karoly Von Toros) in the fact that he’s very up front with what he thinks I’m doing, and he doesn’t mind telling me if I’m doing something wrong.”
Convincing Rousseau to swim for the Gators was a big get 
for Troy, as the redshirt senior has become an integral part of 
the team.
Troy called Rousseau the steadiest swimmer the Gators 
have. Assistant coach Anthony Nesty credited Rousseau’s 
work ethic and leadership as critical components of Florida’s success early this season.“He was probably the most consistent of all our athletes and 
probably of an athlete that I’ve seen in a long, long time here at UF,” Nesty said “I think his performances at the end of the summer — all of our men and women really looked up to the job he did on a day-to-day basis.”
Florida ended Auburn’s 16-year run atop the Southeastern 
Conference at the 2013 SEC Championships in February — something Rousseau acknowledged as the most meaningful moment in his swimming career — and he is determined to make it two straight conference crowns.
But that is a tall order. Florida has placed second behind 
Auburn every other season that Rousseau has swam for the Gators. 
What made 2013 so special is what will make repeating es-
pecially difﬁ  cult. 
“Beating them was great,” Rousseau said. “They were really 
humble in the way that they acted, so that was nice of them, but it was great to ﬁ  nally beat them.”
Florida will get a crack at Auburn before the SEC Champi-
onships this season when the two programs meet Jan. 25 in the O’Connell Center. 
Rousseau expects a bit of nostalgia to join an otherwise com-
petitive meet.
“It’s a real big dual meet for us, just because it’s our senior 
meet,” he said. “It’s at home. It’s Auburn. I’ll never forget my freshman year. That was one of the craziest meets I’ve ever been to. Just so much passion on the team. I’m looking forward to that.”
Rousseau is also hoping for a shot at winning a national 
championship following a disappointing sixth-place ﬁ  nish last season. 
But he is reluctant to consider Florida the favorite. Predicting a champion is too difﬁ  cult with the level of com-
petition, he said, adding that the Gators must simply control the things they can and count on their training and preparation to be enough to be in it at the end. 
Given his success, Rousseau considers winning a national 
championship the ﬁ  nal step in cementing his legacy at UF — but there are some things he considers more important. 
“When I look back, I’ll think just in the moments that I 
shared with these guys are more special than winning a na-
tional championship,” he said. “If we win a national champion-
ship that would be awesome, cherry on top, but sharing these moments, working hard with these guys is what it’s about.”
And working hard is exactly what Rousseau intends to 
keep doing.
“You can get complacent in this sport,” he said. “It’s always 
good to have someone reminding you that you’re not always 
going to be on top and there might be someone else out there 
working harder than you.”
These are wise words from the 23-year-old, who plans to 
stay in Gainesville to continue his four-year training cycle for the 2016 Olympics when his career at Florida is ﬁ  nished. 
But for now, Rousseau is focused on the task at hand.“This year, for me, it’s very special,” he said. “I’m just trying to give everything back that I’ve received 
from all the guys, the coaches and making sure that everyone 
understands what we have to do to in order to accomplish our 
goal.”14, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 6, 2013
Senior swimmer aims to cap successful career with national title

UF swimmer Prather said he has been working 
more at ball handling this season dur-
ing practice, and Donovan is allowing him more chances to take the ball the full length of the court if he sees an 
opening.
“(Donovan) used me a lot in prac-
tice,” Prather said. “He gives me a lot of freedom to 
take the ball off the press or get the ball off the rebound and go with it. 
It’s just something I’m kind of used to now.”
Prather added that he expects to 
be used in the same capacity during the regular season to give the Gators more offensive weapons.
With Florida losing about 51 per-
cent of its offense from last year, Don-
ovan is letting Prather assume more 
of a role as a scorer than he has had in the past. 
His production has gone from av-
eraging two points or fewer per game during his first two seasons to 6.2 points per game in 2012-13. 
And with Prather getting more 
time on the court and getting the ball 
in his hands more throughout the 
game, that number should once again rise.
“I’m just playing more free, more 
loose,” Prather said. “I’m just doing what I know I can do.”
During Florida’s media day, Dono-
van said Prather’s high-ankle sprain 
and concussions were the only things 
that prevented him from having a ter-rific year on the court. 
But the Florida coach added if 
Prather can remain healthy, the 6-foot-
6 senior will show the same level of 
efficiency this season as he did during the NCAA Tournament.
In the Gators’ four tournament 
games, Prather scored 29 points off of 
12-of-19 shooting while grabbing 13 
rebounds.
Prather said his performance from 
last year’s postseason has motivated 
him throughout the offseason as 
Florida prepares for its season opener against North Florida on Friday.
“It just made me hungry,” he said. 
“It gave me something to work for 
knowing I could play with anybody 
in the country.” of college — when he weighed in at a slim 290 
pounds, according to Rivals.com — and when he enrolled at Florida in May is what allowed 
him to succeed on the line. 
Brown attributed his growth at Georgia Mili-
tary College to one meal in particular — Zaxby’s 
chicken-finger plate.
“We’d eat Zaxby’s like two times a day,” he 
said. “The cafeteria wasn’t the best.”
Although Brown is a force on the line, Flori-
da’s staff is having him slow down. He said he wants to slim down to 340 pounds — limiting 
his Zaxby’s intake to the occasional salad. 
Moore said Brown is surprisingly athletic at 
his current size, and he can make plays against 
the best players the Gators throw at him during 
practice.
“I saw him take down Dante Fowler on the 
pass rush,” Moore said. “(Fowler is), if not this 
year, next year, (an) All-American defensive end, and he made him look like he was a high-
school kid.”
UF needs all the help it can get on the line. 
Florida has already struggled against strong 
defensive players such as Miami’s Tyriq Mc-
Cord, Missouri’s Michael Sam and Georgia’s 
Ray Drew. The Gators still have All-American Gamecocks lineman Jadeveon Clowney loom-ing.
But with Brown on the line, the Gators re-
ceived a big, potentially NFL-bound boost.
“He showed little clips of being what he can 
be, which I’d say at least a third-round pick in the NFL, if not higher if he can continue to play, 
continue to develop the way he is,” Moore said. 
“He’s a big guy and has great reach and ev-
erything. So he can be something special if he 
keeps working.”like that” but that any joking in the Flori-
da locker room remains good-natured. 
“Once you start using some terms 
that should not be said by certain people, you’ve gone way too far,” Moore said. 
Struggles in the red zone: Florida’s of-
fense ranks 104th in the nation in scoring, and being inefficient in the red zone has been a critical factor. 
Of the 31 trips the Gators have made 
into the red zone this season, they have come away with just 14 touchdowns and eight field goals for a 71 percent success rate — the lowest in the Southeastern Conference. 
Auburn leads the SEC in red-zone ef-
ficiency, scoring on 33 of 37 tries. Mean-while, Texas A&M leads the conference 
with 44 touchdowns in the red zone this 
season.
“We’re not getting there enough,” of-
fensive coordinator Brent Pease said. “We do need more touchdowns. We get in sit-uations where we settle.” 
Compounding Florida’s problem is 
the lack of consistency from its kickers. The Gators have used three kickers this 
season — Austin Hardin, Francisco Velez and Brad Phillips — and each has been 
shaky.   
Hardin, the lone scholarship kicker on 
the roster, has made just 4 of 9 attempts, including misses in two of Florida’s first three games. Phillips made his only field-goal try but shanked an extra point and has underwhelmed in practice.
Velez, who currently handles kicking 
duties on shorter attempts, missed a 40-yard try against Georgia. 
Because each kicker has struggled, 
coach Will Muschamp has declared the position open as the Gators continue to search for an answer to their woes. 
“We’re going to look at it again this 
week,” Muschamp said. 
Freshman losing ground: Demarcus 
Robinson continues to be a non-factor in Florida’s offense and seemingly has lost 
the confidence of Pease.
On Sept. 17, Florida’s offensive coordi-
nator said he expected Robinson to “pop” 
sometime soon. On Tuesday, his com-ments were less optimistic. 
“Demarcus has to be more consistent 
with what he does,” Pease said. “Right now, he’s a good kid and he’s got a lot of ability, but you’ve got to continue to 
compete.”WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 6, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 15

When Florida lost two straight games 
against Missouri and South Carolina early 
in conference play, its chances of winning a Southeastern Conference title looked grim.
The team talked about not losing any more 
games after the 2-1 double-overtime defeat against the Gamecocks, and the Gators suc-ceeded, ending the regular season tied atop the conference standings.
Entering the SEC Tournament as the No. 1 seed, Florida will make its tournament de-but tonight against Arkansas at the Orange Beach Sportsplex in Orange Beach, Ala., at 6.
Eighth-seeded Arkansas won in a 4-0 
shutout against ninth-seeded Missouri on 
Monday night to advance to the second 
round of the tournament.
The Razorbacks, who were one of the two 
SEC opponents the Gators did not face in the regular season, ﬁ  nished with a 5-6 record in conference play. Coach Becky Burleigh said Arkansas is a 
good team to face because of its contrasting style of play to Florida’s 4-2-3-1 formation and one-two-touch style on the ﬁ  eld.
“That’s something we still need to get bet-
ter at,” Burleigh said of playing dissimilar 
opponents. 
“We have to trust the way that we play. 
We have to trust one another.
“Everyone has a strength on this team, 
and let them do their strengths. We are really 
strong when everyone is playing that way.”Burleigh said the Gators improved great-
ly since the beginning of the season, and they have grown into something special.
“The Mississippi State game was one of 
our turning points,” Burleigh said. “That day we had the big team meeting and then we 
played that game that night. I think we got 
closer because of that whole day and that ex-perience. 
“As long as we can demonstrate that at 
a high level, then it gives us a really good chance to win.” Gators begin SEC Tournament play against Razorbacks
