Tasty Buddha, a local Asian cuisine res-
taurant, has ofﬁ  cially closed the doors to both 
its locations due to insurmountable debt.
Owner Parker Van Hart posted on the res-
taurant’s Facebook page Monday explaining the debt and requesting ﬁ  nancial help. 
The post called the chain “viable busi-
nesses” but states that it is in a “very danger-ous situation.” The business dropped from $250,000 in debt to $75,000 in debt, but the employee strike over the summer changed 
that.
Van Hart said as of Tuesday, both loca-tions have ofﬁ  cially shut down.
“Because of the strike, we are in a situa-
tion we can’t dig out [of],” he said. “I’ve tried to raise the money. There’s no options left 
and nothing left to say. We’re done.”Mo Sherman, a 24-year-old former cook 
at Tasty Buddha, said the employees didn’t know the restaurant was closing until Tues-day, when the general manager arrived a few 
hours into the workday and announced it.
Employees were told they may not re-
ceive their last paychecks right away, Sher-
man said, because the owner is trying to sell restaurant equipment to cover expenses.
“Hopefully, this weekend he can sell the Tasty Buddha closes its two locations due to debt

Indie pop artists Capital 
Cities, and Fitz and the Tan-
trums will perform at the Phil-lips Center for the Performing Arts on Nov. 11 at 7 p.m.  
It’s sponsored by Student 
Government Productions. Ni-cole Berrio, vice chairwoman of public relations for SGP, said tickets will be free for students and distributed at the Phillips Center box ofﬁ  ce at noon Nov. 7. Two tickets can be issued per student 
with a UFID.
“We thought that it would 
be a great idea to bring these two bands, not only for expo-
sure for our campus,” said the 21-year-old public relations senior, “but also for our stu-dents to get a new and differ-ent kind of music.”
SGP chairman Daniel Levin 
said SGP is paying $40,000 for 
the show. Levin, a 21-year-old 
industrial and systems engi-neering senior, said there will also be a fee for renting the Phillips Center, but SGP has not received a ﬁ  nal quote.
Special guest Beat Club 
will join the main acts, Berrio said. 
Tickets can be purchased 
by the general public on the day of the show, if available.
“They’re both up-and-
coming indie rock bands that are very energetic and up-beat,” Berrio said. “It should be a really, really fun show.”SGP to bring

Local supporters of medical marijuana in 
Florida want the ban on the substance to go 
up in smoke, and the movement may be com-ing closer to UF soon.
Brandon Harvey, the president of NORML 
Gators and a 19-year-old UF neuroscience sophomore, said the club is bringing the move-ment more prominence on campus.
The group, which supports the legaliza-
tion of medical marijuana, is planning to start a concentrated effort to collect signatures, in-cluding tabling in free-speech zones, he said.
The movement has recently attracted some 
big names in support of the measure, includ-ing attorney John Morgan, of Morgan and Morgan law ﬁ  rm and chairman of United for 
Care, an organization supporting the proposal 
to legalize medical marijuana in the state.
Morgan said he chose to join the organiza-
tion because he’s seen medical marijuana ben-eﬁ  t his father and brother.
“I just thought if no one stepped up in Flor-
ida, we’d go another two years or four years or 10 years,” he said. “So I decided to be the one.”In his Florida radio spots, Morgan said he’s 
looking for an “army of angels” to support the 
measure. 
He lists a personal email address in the ad, 
which he said receives thousands of messages 
per day.
The law is very similar to the contended 
California law, but Harvey said he believes it would become more strict after its passage through Florida legislation.
“It would function basically exactly like 
California’s does,” he said. “Medicine would be purchased through registered cannabis vendor outlets and could be prescribed by a 
licensed Florida physician.”
The proposal was sent to the attorney gen-
eral of Florida, where she will review the con-
stitutionality of the language of the bill. After that, the proposal would need 700,000 signa-tures by February 2014, Morgan said.

McDonald’s Corp. has started serving 
chicken wings, but some locals say the 
new item may not ﬂ  y in Gainesville.
Coinciding with the beginning of foot-
ball season, Mighty Wings have temporar-ily joined the menu until mid-November.
Hoss Rice, a manager at Gator’s Dock-
side, said he’s not concerned about the competition because atmosphere plays an important role in attracting customers.
“The people that are going to go to Mc-
Donald’s for chicken wings are just driv-
ing on their way home and are like, ‘Man, 
I really want some wings, and I don’t have time to go somewhere good,’” he said.
Alexis Thomas, a 21-year-old nursing 
sophomore at Santa Fe College, said she doesn’t think McDonald’s poses a signiﬁ  -cant threat to existing wing joints because, as of right now, the restaurant only offers one ﬂ  avor.
“I think if they switch it up and add 
original or buffalo, it will make an effect,” she said.
However, Thomas said she thinks the 
atmosphere doesn’t have as much inﬂ  u-ence if the food is good.
“The way your food is made determines 
whether or not you want to eat there, ” she 
said. “Depending on how hungry you are, 
you are going to want to sit there and eat regardless. All you are worried about is getting that food in your mouth while it’s 
hot.”
David Alexander, a 22-year-old UF tele-
communication junior, expressed a differ-
ent sentiment about fast-food wings.
“I think what makes the best wings is 
the quality of the chicken and how well they’re seasoned,” he said.
Alexander said atmosphere does play a 
large role in the settings in which people traditionally enjoy wings.
“You eat wings while you’re watching 
a football game, and you can’t really do that at McDonald’s,” he said.McDonald’s is just trying to ﬁ  nd a way 
to capitalize on a popular food that every-one enjoys, he said.“I don’t think they are truly master-
ing the craft of chicken wings,” Alexander said.

Arts and sciences will be coming 
together at the Samuel P. Harn Mu-
seum of Art on Thursday.
Arts in Engineering will be at 
the Harn from 6 to 9 p.m. as part of 
the Museum Nights series. The an-
nual event features musical perfor-mances and artistic works created by faculty members and students of the College of Engineering.  
Eric Segal, education curator of 
academic programs at the museum, said this year will feature a video digital interaction display that can project the image of participants onto a prerecorded background.
“It’s a wonderful surprise for 
people to discover that engineers have such strong and diverse artis-tic abilities,” he said.
Diana Alarcon, a 21-year-old in-
dustrial and systems engineering senior, is presenting four silk-screen prints and two pairs of white can-vas shoes she painted with acrylic 
paint.
“I think this event is unique in 
the sense that it showcases that en-
gineers can break the stereotypes,” she said. “Too often, we’re put into this box where we’re just supposed to do math and be analytical.”
The event will also feature The-atre Strike Force, art activities spon-sored by the Museum University Student Educators, an interactive 
educational game called “Will It 
Float?” and a centrifugal force paint-ing, Segal said.
Angela Lindner, associate dean for student affairs in the College of Engineering, said with the large number of entries, the event will have a high energy level.
James O’Connell, environmental 
engineering senior, will be perform-
ing saxophone duets at the show. 
O’Connell, 21, said playing saxo-phone has taught him skills vital in engineering, including patience, dis-cipline and the value of hard work.
“Engineering is about solving 
problems, and sometimes, you have to be creative,” he said.

said. “Legally, we are owed that. It’s the matter of how soon or how late we’ll be paid that is up in the air.”
Sherman said the strike affected the restau-
rant’s financial situation, but it couldn’t have been the entire cause for the restaurant shutdown.
Sherman, who has a second job, said he was 
concerned for the rest of the staff because the news came so suddenly, but he said he thinks Van Hart had reasons for delaying news of the shutdown.
“I’m sure this has been in the works for a while,” 
he said. “The only reason he didn’t tell any of us was because he was trying to work something out before he had to close. I’m sure the reason he kept it from us was to try to save it if at all possible.”

said she is disappointed.

With new, just-announced  
UF mobile app updates to 
come in the Spring, students 
won’t have to look further 
than their smartphones for important information on campus.
The UF Mobile app, re-
leased in June for both iP-hone and Android, is work-ing on updates suggested by and geared toward students, 
said Tracy Gale, communica-
tions manager for UF Infor-mation Technology.
Updates include dining 
information regarding menus and open/close indicators, parking information for spe-cific lots and decals, and a feature that allows students 
to map their classes based 
on their course schedule, ac-cording to a news release.
“Based on the feedback 
we’ve received,” Gale said, “parking and dining were over and above the most common suggestion.”
Gale said the UF Mo-bile team meets regularly to evaluate what’s performing well and being used, as well as feedback received. Stu-
dent feedback was the main 
method of deciding which updates to incorporate.
“We try to pick updates 
that will have maximum im-
pact,” she said.
Hannah Helms, a 19-year-
old UF public relations soph-
omore, is a frequent user of 
the app.
The new features will be 
especially useful for fresh-
men and transfer students, she said.
“By going to the students 
and asking what will make their lives easier,” she said, “people will definitely use 
the app more.”UF app announces

Pride History Week and His-
panic Heritage Month teamed up 
Tuesday night to facilitate a con-versation about embracing multiple identities.
Felipe Sousa-Rodriguez, an un-
docuqueer activist and co-direc-tor of social justice organization GetEQUAL, discussed what it’s like to be a gay, undocumented U.S. resi-dent.
Sousa-Rodriguez said he’s a 
member of both groups.
“Opening up the space to talk 
about multiple identities (opens) up doors once closed,” he said. “The well-being of the community is the well-being of oneself.”Sousa-Rodriguez, who was born 
in the slums of Brazil and immigrat-ed to the United States when he was 14, said part of his mission is to leave his family with the world in a better state than how he got it.
“We live in a world where peo-
ple try to tell us there is only black and white, good and bad, gay and straight,” he said. “We actually live in a spectrum.”
Another part of the discussion 
was the lack of federal funding un-documented residents receive from universities, including UF. Cur-rently, undocumented residents living in Florida pay four times as much as Florida residents to attend UF, said Yaissy Solis, a 21-year-old journalism senior and president of CHISPAS.
“We wanted to bring the immi-
gration movement to the gay com-
munity because LGBTQ rights are 
immigrant rights,” she said.
Hiram Martinez-Cabrera, Pride 
Student Union’s internal vice presi-dent, agreed. He said both the His-panic and queer communities face similar challenges in fighting for rights.
“Undocumented immigration 
issues are still LGBTQ issues,” said Martinez-Cabrera, a 19-year-old UF public relations sophomore.

Grabbing a cocktail with the ladies could put the 
twins at risk.
The Student Health Care Center said in a tweet 
posted Friday, “Drinking #alcohol increases the 
risk of #breast #cancer. The level of risk rises as the 
amount of alcohol consumed rises.”
Catherine A. Seemann, communications coordi-
nator for the SHCC, said students should be aware 
of all risks associated with breast cancer.
“While females cannot change certain risk factors 
such as age, genetics, family history of breast cancer, and race and ethnicity,” she said, “they may be able to take control of lifestyle-related risk factors such as alcohol consumption, physical activity and weight.”
It is important for people to have regular check-
ups and be aware of their bodies, Seemann said.
She said the information from the tweet was taken 
directly from the American Cancer Society’s website, cancer.org.
In comparison to nondrinkers, women who con-
sumed between two to five drinks daily have a 1.5 times greater risk of developing breast cancer, ac-cording to the website.
Beauty Kolenc, a 25-year-old UF public relations 
senior, said her mom is a breast cancer survivor.
“It was really hard to watch my mom go through 
all of the cancer treatments,” she said. “She had sur-gery, chemo and radiation therapy.”
Kolenc said her mom is 43 years old.“My mom is young,” she said. “I’m just glad that 
she got herself checked out and that her doctors were so aggressive with her treatments.”
Kolenc said her mom rarely drinks and doesn’t 
smoke.
“I do drink socially,” she said. “If I knew that 
those factors were going to increase my risk, I would make changes to try and lower my risk of getting cancer.”SHCC: Drinking not best for breasts
Most Florida voters would support it
ordinator for United For Care, said about 70 percent of Floridians indi-cated they would support medical marijuana if it were on the ballot.
The Tabernacle of Hedonism, 
a local group, is also talking about supporting the initiative. Paul Cohen, 54, who is known as 
Reverend Angeldust to the Taber-nacle, said the group is considering tabling at UF and in Gainesville to 
drum up support for the proposal, 
which he calls “a good cause.”
But not everyone agrees. Shruti Kadam, a 20-year-old UF 
sociology junior, said she worries some could take advantage of the law.
“I think that the biggest draw-
back to it is that people who don’t 
really need it claim that they do,” 
she said. “It’s an excuse for some users when they could just be using safer, healthier alternatives.”

Tuesday night was split between familiar and fresh faces 
in a bittersweet double-header Student Senate meeting.
Outgoing senators gave their last words in the ﬁ  rst part 
of the meeting, and new senators became acquainted with 
procedures and committees in the second half.
In Elisabeth Chauncey’s farewell speech, she referred to 
her moments in Senate as some of the most memorable ones 
of her freshman year.
She gave words of wisdom to those remaining: “People 
are going to remember you by the person that you are, not 
the title that you hold or the position that you have.”
Some had sharper words in their goodbye speeches.
In a shrinking caucus, some outgoing Students Party sen-
ators said their piece.
Outgoing Sen. Stephanie Kreitzer kicked off public de-
bate with strong sentiments.
“I want you to realize that whether you worked hard for 
your position or it was handed to you, you all started out the same way,” she said.
At the tail end of the ﬁ  rst meeting, Supervisor of Elec-
tions Justin Hoover presented the Fall 2013 election results, which were certiﬁ  ed by unanimous consent.
Ringing in the second half of the night, UF Supreme 
Court Chief Justice Marcus Powers swore in the new batch 
of senators.
Moving forward, the chambers dealt with a shift in high-
er Senate positions.
After a long career in the Senate, Lauren Verno stepped 
down from her position as Senate president. 
Senate Pro-Tempore Cory Yeffet, the only nomination for 
Senate president, stepped up to ﬁ  ll her position.
But before exiting the building, Verno made her mark 
with a few words received by applause.
“The one thing I have learned is to truly make friends,” 
she said. “I have made friends across party lines. It has made 
me a person that respects others.”
Elliot Grasso was the sole nomination for the pro-tempo-re position vacated by Yeffet. Later on, he resigned from his position as allocations chairman.
After a unanimous vote, Powers swore in Yeffet and 
Grasso.
Members-at-large positions for the Replacement and 
Agenda committee were next on the agenda to be ﬁ  lled. Christina Chan-Pong and Joselin Padron-Rasines were unri-valed for the ﬁ  rst and second seats, respectively.
“It’s a position I won’t take lightly because I know that 
with my judgement, I get to select the people who will hope-fully serve as senators,” Padron-Rasines said after the meet-ing.WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 9, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 5

The ﬁ  rst two professors have 
been chosen for the UF Founda-
tion’s brand-new Preeminence Term Professorships.
Chemical engineer Fan Ren 
and pathologist Mark Atkinson were both given $25,000 after be-ing selected from a pool of UF fac-ulty nominated by their colleges’ deans.
UF spokesman Steve Orlando said this is the ﬁ  rst time the award has ever been given, and the uni-versity’s goal is to announce two recipients yearly.
“It’s a way to acknowledge the 
great work these professors have 
been doing and help them contin-
ue that work,” he said.
He said the award was created 
by the UF Foundation, the fund-raising and gift-fund manage-ment branch of the university. The money awarded was from private donations to the university.According to a news release, 
Ren and Atkinson can use the money to hire research assistants, buy equipment, attend special trainings, travel, collaborate on work and promote their research.
The idea was to connect these 
awards with UF’s preeminence in the state, Orlando said. Gov. Rick Scott titled UF a preeminent uni-versity earlier this year and called 
for it to become a top 10 public uni-
versity in the nation.
Atkinson oversees a team of 
doctors and researchers focused on determining the causes of diabetes and how to prevent it, according to a news release.
Ren leads a UF team working on creating sensors that detect chemi-cal and biological signs indicative of health issues like kidney disease and breast cancer.
Hans Rojas, a 20-year-old UF 
marketing junior, said because the 
university is involved in so much 
research, it’s important to reward its professors for hard work.
“Those professors are doing 
research for bettering the lives of humans,” Rojas said. “The award does nothing but encourage con-tinued good research.”

acknowledge the great 
work these professors have 
been doing and help them 
continue that work.”

Haters will always hate. These days, bashing politi-
cians and journalists has become en vogue. Critics forget that our representatives uphold the world’s 
greatest democracy by toiling night and day to represent 
a helpless minority: corporate executives. Having a media 
subservient to the powerful is also vital to our prosperity.
Take Congress, for example.When the health care debate began a few years ago, 
polls indicated anywhere fom 60 to 77 percent of Ameri-cans wanted a public health-care option. Private corpora-tions weren’t too hot for Washington to implement poli-cies that would threaten their proﬁ  ts, and we ended up 
with the Affordable Care Act — or Obamacare.
Don’t just credit Republicans for prioritizing insurance 
companies over the American public. In fact, it was a he-
roic Democratic senator who rose to the occasion when he blocked the public option. Thank God we have bipartisan representation for the voiceless Wall Street boardrooms.  
I love it when both parties can become united. Take 
President Barack Obama, for example.
Neither Republican nor Democratic leaders have any 
serious qualms with the president’s drone strategy that literally, “terrorizes men, women, and children, giving rise to anxiety and psychological trauma among civilian communities,” as a Stanford/NYU study reported. How awesome is the bipartisan backing of Obama’s drone war-fare that kills thousands of Pakistanis and Yemenis with no due process?
But let’s be honest: We’ve had a few hiccups in our na-
tion’s past. For example, granting women “personhood” — i.e., the same legal rights as everyone else — was a bad idea.
Fortunately, federal courts don’t allow that craziness 
anymore. Nonresident aliens are “nonpersons” in today’s America — just like the good ole days when black people, akin to farm cattle, lacked personhood in the eyes of the law.
As for the Wall Street boys, don’t worry. The Supreme Court has conversely expanded personhood to include corpora-tions, meaning they beneﬁ  t, like actual human beings, from legal 
rights.
Another problem: freedom of 
the press. Some years ago came 
a close call, but what if we don’t get so lucky next time?
In the early 1970s, the FBI’s 
secret targeting of civil rights groups — culminating in the assassination of Fred Hampton, a black activist, while 
he was asleep in bed with his pregnant ﬁ  ancee — was 
exposed. For years, U.S. presidents from both parties en-dorsed the FBI pranks.
Luckily, instead of informing the public of the criminal 
operations, journalists obsessed over the Watergate scan-dal. After all, the Nixon administration had pissed off half America’s powerful political establishment, the Demo-
crats. It’s always safer to do TV segments on the bickering 
between the political parties than tell the public how the FBI — with bipartisan support — suppressed poor, black activists.
I am scared of a day when the media actually begins to 
serve the ordinary American public.
Instead of focusing on our enemies’ devious behavior, 
what if journalists highlighted our own government’s support for Israel and Saudi Arabia, two countries with sickening human rights records? Worse yet, what if the 
American public suddenly realizes we live in a democracy 
where the voters with actual inﬂ  uence are multinational corporations?
Can we — just in case journalists forget their role of 
being ﬁ  gureheads for the powerful — remove freedom of the press? Just to be safe, let’s also ban freedom of speech — except sarcasm, that is.
Zulkar Khan is a UF microbiology senior. His column runs 
on Wednesdays. A spread in Elle UK’s November issue aimed at “rebrand-
ing feminism” has sparked outrage among bloggers and online media outlets such as the Hufﬁ  ngton Post, 
the Guardian and Buzzfeed.
According to AdWeek, the British women’s magazine en-
listed the help of three advertising agencies — Brave, Mother London and Wieden + Kennedy — to make the concept of feminism cooler, sexier and sleeker with the help of neat in-fographics designed to prove to readers they are, in fact, femi-nists. Feminism, as we know, is a terribly radical concept: The advocacy of women’s rights on the grounds of political, social and economic equality to men. Scary!
The term feminism unfortunately stirs up vivid images of 
bra-burning — which, by the way, never actually happened at 
the 1968 Miss America pageant— and angry man-haters. The 
negative connotations aren’t helped by prominent stars such as Katy Perry repeating the tired “I’m not a feminist, but . . .” claim.
The images produced by the advertisers for Elle’s femi-
nism rebranding campaign, with their bold pink lettering and reader-friendly infographics, don’t exactly align with Gloria Steinem’s early sentiments on feminism: “The truth will set you free, but ﬁ  rst it will piss you off.”
Feminism, as Hufﬁ  ngton Post writer Tali Kord wrote, 
doesn’t need a rebrand.
“Rebranding is something you do to, well, a brand: a com-
modity that you are attempting to sell to the consumer,” Kord wrote. “But an ideology is not a hip must-have like a leather jacket or a roll-neck sweater.”
“Reducing feminism to a trend is annoying to say the least, 
and is made even worse when it comes from Elle, a publication full of pictures of thin, beautiful white women,” Kord wrote. 
“Elle wants you to hashtag to the world about your hairy legs, 
but I wouldn’t hold your breath if you’re expecting to actually see any of those on its pages.”
It’s particularly disgusting a women’s magazine that aids 
in perpetuating an unattainable ideal for women’s bodies — not to mention hawking truly hideous yellow, blue and green bejeweled rubber gladiator sandals that look not unlike a pair of bedazzled Crocs — would manipulate the ongoing struggle for gender equality into an advertising campaign to drive up 
magazine sales.
Besides, the Guardian writer Laurie Penny wrote, it doesn’t 
matter how feminism is repackaged — it’ll still be subjected to 
unsavory, unvalidated stereotypes.
“The stereotype of the ugly, unf**kable feminist exists for a 
reason — because it’s still the last, best line of defense against any woman who is a little too loud, a little too political.
“Correct me if I’m wrong, but I’ve always believed part of 
the point of feminist politics — part of the point of any sort of 
radical politics — is some principles are more important than 
being universally adored, particularly by the sort of men who 
would prefer women to smile quietly and grow our hair out.”

Public opinion polls consistently show Americans are frus-
trated with the disproportionate inﬂ  uence large corpora-
tions and extremely wealthy individuals have on our gov-
ernment and political process.
In a September poll from the Pew 
Research Center, 67 percent of respon-
dents said the policies of the federal 
government following the 2008 ﬁ  nan-cial crisis and recession were designed 
to beneﬁ  t large corporations, and 59 percent said those policies were intend-ed to aid the wealthy. At the same time, 
broad majorities indicated the govern-ment had done little or nothing to help 
the poor — 72 percent — or the middle class — 71 percent.
Americans’ perception of their government as being run for 
the beneﬁ  t of corporate America is validated by current pub-
lic policy. Following the ﬁ  nancial crisis in 2008, the U.S. federal 
government disbursed about $4.76 trillion to various entities, with almost all those funds going to the country’s largest banks 
and ﬁ  nancial institutions.
Congress and the rest of the federal government approved 
these bailouts for Wall Street but chose not to enact stronger ﬁ  -nancial regulations that might help prevent a similar crisis in 
the future.  The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer 
Protection Act, a piece of ﬁ  nancial reform that was passed in the 
aftermath of the recession, has generally been deemed unlikely to help prevent a future meltdown of the ﬁ  nancial sector.
Gary Rivlin of The Nation wrote that the bill requires the co-
operation of federal regulators like the Securities and Exchange Commission, bureaucratic agencies that “failed so miserably at protecting the public interest in the run-up to the 2008 crash.”
One explanation for public policy emerging from Washing-
ton that consistently favors the rich and powerful over the mid-dle and lower classes is the ever-increasing amount of campaign contributions wealthy interests donate to candidates for federal 
ofﬁ  ce.
In 2010, the Supreme Court issued a ruling in Citizens United 
v. Federal Election Commission that overturned previous restric-
tions on so-called “independent expenditures,” money spent by corporations, labor unions and other associations on political 
advertising. Although the ruling did not address the issue of di-
rect contributions by corporations to political campaigns, which 
remain illegal under federal law, the decision was viewed as the 
ﬁ  rst step toward dismantling existing campaign ﬁ  nance laws.
Now, the Supreme Court is taking up a case, McCutcheon 
v. FEC, that could completely eliminate all limits on campaign 
contributions. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-
Ky.), a longtime opponent of campaign ﬁ  nance restrictions, will 
testify before the Supreme Court in favor of dismantling the few 
remaining regulations that restrict the ﬂ  ow of money into politi-
cal campaigns.
It should come as no surprise that Sen. McConnell has been 
one of the greatest beneﬁ  ciaries of corporate political donations. 
According to opensecrets.org, a website that tracks political con-tributions, McConnell has received hundreds of thousands of 
dollars from large corporations in just the last ﬁ  ve years. Em-
ployees of Citigroup Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. — in-
stitutions that received bailout funds passed with McConnell’s 
support — have donated about $160,000 to his most recent re-election campaigns.
Even with the campaign ﬁ  nance laws that currently exist, our 
political system essentially incorporates a form of legalized brib-
ery. The system of private campaign donations ensures those 
with the most ﬁ  nancial resources are those whose interests and 
issues the government prioritizes. Rather than loosening cam-
paign ﬁ  nance laws, private campaign contributions should be 
banned entirely in favor of a system of taxpayer-ﬁ  nanced cam-
paigns.
Such a system would root out a great deal of corruption in the 
American government by preventing corporations and wealthy Americans from inﬂ  uencing politicians with their dollars. Ad-
ditionally, members of Congress will focus more on policies that 
beneﬁ  t their constituents, who are mostly poor and middle-class 
voters, and less on the wealthy’s interests that currently have a 
stranglehold on public policy.

opinions@alligator.orgOn Oct. 1, I began a search for the on-
line market known as the Amazon of drugs: the Silk Road. I had heard 
stories about this place before from friends — and friends of friends — whose experi-
ence with drugs and technology far exceeded my own. 
Named for the ancient trade routes running from 
China to Arabia and Eastern Europe, this website was 
a place where anything from books to art to cigarettes could be bought or sold without interference from any sort of outside authority.  
Of course, in a setting like this, the majority of the 
market was dominated by drugs — 70 percent of the products traded on this site were drugs. Heroin, MDMA, 
marijuana, cocaine, even old world vices like opium —  
all this was available.  
I hadn’t heard of anything like it since the tent city 
at Bonnaroo. I wanted to see this thing for myself, and ﬁ  nally, my curiosity got the better of me. So I Googled “Silk Road marketplace” and found several blog posts with detailed instructions on how to ﬁ  nd this digital drug bazaar. One can’t ﬁ  nd access to the Silk Road just anywhere. To ﬁ  nd it, you need to download a special 
browser called Tor — the only browser capable of ﬁ  nd-
ing the Silk Road — and a proxy server service to protect your identity. On top of that, all transactions are carried out in Bitcoins, a digital currency, to further protect ano-nymity. All these things sounded complicated and very shady.  So I put off ﬁ  nding the market until another day, perhaps indeﬁ  nitely.  
Twelve hours later, the FBI arrested the 
founder of the Silk Road and shut down the site. Ross William Ulbricht, known on 
the marketplace as the Dread Pirate Roberts, left clues to his identity on forums around the web. He also hired a hit man to kill a former employee, but unfortunately for DPR, the “hit man” was  an undercover agent.  The website itself was seized, as well as the government’s biggest haul of Bitcoins to date — 26,000 (more than $3,156,000).  
Clearly, Ulbricht broke many, many laws, and he 
probably deserved to go to jail.  But was his “economic 
experiment” shut down because he solicited murder or 
to win a victory in the drug war?  Or is there something larger at play? It doesn’t appear to be coincidence that, in the midst of a government shutdown, the FBI contin-ued its dogged pursuit to destroy this blatant challenge to the government’s power.  
This wasn’t really about drugs or murder — this was 
about control. In this age of Snowden, Manning and As-sange, the Internet is the government’s worst enemy. It’s 
an anarchic, decentralized place that doesn’t actually ex-
ist in the real world and manages to elude and embar-rass the government at every turn.

Reality singing shows such as 
“The Voice” or “American Idol” suggest certain people 
are born with some special talent and therefore deserve to become rich 
and famous. The idea people can just sing a few 
songs and have their lives changed is appeal-ing to viewers because maybe one day, our own natural talents will be fully appreciated, too.
But the situations occurring in reality sing-
ing competitions just don’t happen in real life. 
Barraging the public with the belief they’ll 
make it big if they’re special enough is not only demeaning to vocalists who have worked hard 
for years to perfect their craft, but it also runs 
the risk of causing viewers to apply this idea to their lives.
It’s true some people are just naturally better 
at singing than others. Just like any other talent, hard work can only take you so far. To be the best requires a mix of hard work and natural talent.
Just like hard work can only 
take you so far, natural talent is not 
enough to make it big. 
By perpetuating the idea natural talent is 
the only road to success, reality singing shows give viewers the impression if they have tal-ent, they’re a guaranteed star, while a person of slightly lesser talent will never make it big simply because of nature.
Rather than subscribing to the views of a re-
ality show and relying solely on natural talent, 
look to real-world musicians for inspiration: 
Find a passion and perfect it.

� SOME BUSINESSES DON’T PLAN TO 
KEEP THE GROWN-UP CUBS.
KRISTINA RAMER
Alligator Contributing Writer
Carl Bovard lets visitors play with tiger 
cub Summer at Single Vision, a wildlife 
sanctuary in Melrose. But new legislation may prevent the public from interacting with cubs like Summer.
This month, the U.S. Department of Ag-
riculture will vote on an amendment that would restrict people’s interaction with big cats, bears and primates. If the amend-ment passes, the public would not be al-lowed within 15 feet of these animals, and caretakers would be prohibited from bot-tle-feeding or hand-raising unless a veteri-narian deemed it medically necessary.
Jeff Kremer, director of donor appre-
ciation at Big Cat Rescue in Tampa, said the legislation is aimed at roadside zoos and “pseudo-sanctuaries” that exploit cubs. Too often, he said, these businesses acquire cubs and make large sums from letting people visit with them. These busi-nesses never plan to keep the adult animal and often send grown tigers to unsuitable environments.
Allowing the public to interact with 
cubs has subsequently created a breeding market, Kremer said. The new legislation could eliminate loopholes across the coun-try.
“There are patchworks of differing laws 
and regulations across states,” he said.
Florida already has some of the strictest 
animal ownership laws in the country, but it also has one of the highest numbers of animal escapes, Kremer said.
Bovard agreed that stricter national 
measures are needed to regulate breeding exotic animals. But he said he’s opposed to the USDA amendment because it will pun-ish responsible animal caretakers, too.
“When you breed a cat like this, you 
need to have a plan for its whole life. You can’t breed it and just plan on selling it in six months,” he said.
Although there are about 3,000 tigers in 
the wild, about 5,000 captive tigers are es-timated to be in private hands in the U.S. alone, according to worldwildlife.org. The amendment would affect every legitimate educational facility across the country, Bo-vard said.
“Without giving the public a chance to 
see the animals, we lose the ability to edu-cate,” he said.

A recent Internet trend could pose 
a health concern for young women, 
especially those in college.
The trend, called the thigh gap, has 
shown up on social networking sites like Pinterest and Tumblr and fea-tures a picture of a girl whose thighs 
are too thin to touch when the girl’s 
feet are touching. Often, the picture is accompanied with a caption or water-mark that says “feet together, thighs apart.”
Caroline Payne-Purvis, a 27-year-
old UF doctoral candidate in health education and behavior, said this new fad promotes unhealthy body expec-
tations.“Through social media, teenag-
ers are now feeling that they have to 
conform through the Internet as well 
as through everyday life,” she said. 
“Objectification has been found to be associated with eating disorders and depression, especially among girls 
that don’t meet that body type.”
Some students see the trend as un-
reasonable.
“I think it’s kind of ridiculous,” 
said 21-year-old Erika Ritzmann.
As a former dancer, the UF inter-
national studies and anthropology 
senior said she is well-versed in the thigh gap but said women should just 
focus on exercising to be healthy.
“I would never have a thigh gap, 
like, my hips are too narrow, and I’m 
OK with that,” Ritzman said.Unhealthy Internet fad

At an Alachua County 
Commission meeting Tuesday, 
noise and dust presented road-blocks as the City of Gainesville moved toward buying the bio-
mass power plant before a 30-
year contract kicks in.
County Environmental 
Protection Director Chris Bird called the wood dust blow-ing from the biomass plant the highest priority because it’s causing irritation for workers at the Gainesville Public Works 
building, the plant’s closest 
neighbor. 
Workers are wearing dust 
masks outside the facility, Bird said, and some staff are noting eye discomfort from these dust 
particles. They also coat nearby 
vehicles.
For now, he said the focus 
will be on cataloging the wood debris falling around the Public Works building and “nagging” the state government to make sure a Florida Department of Environmental Protection air 
permit is enforced.
“If we can get it fixed at Pub-
lic Works, we can get it fixed 
anywhere,” Bird said.
Noise readings show the 
sounds emitted from the plant register at about 52 decibels outside the perimeter, well be-
low the city ordinance, which 
limits noise to 66 decibels dur-ing the day and 60 at night, said Richard Wolf, assistant director of the Alachua County Depart-ment of Growth Management.
He said even though the irri-
tant is below the allowed limit, people are still complaining.
“I think we need to get off 
the issue of whether it is or isn’t a violation based on measure-ment,” Wolf said. “We need to concentrate on what’s causing the annoyance and how do we eliminate it or mitigate it.”
Commissioner Susan Baird 
said before a contract gets set 
in stone, leaders need to figure 
out what is causing the irritants and determine if and how to fix them. She said hiring another independent company to take noise readings over a longer period of time would be a “very wise use of funds.”Commission weighs concerns

moon-gazing event Saturday night.
From 7 to 10 p.m., residents will 
observe International Observe the Moon Night at the Easton New-berry Sports Complex.
The free event will offer a 
range of telescopes provided by the club, a laser-guided tour of the constellations and a Q-and-A ses-sion with local astronomers.Participants will also be led in 
an experiment to see how craters are formed on the surface of the moon. They will simulate the sce-nario by throwing objects at a tub filled with flour.
The evening is aimed at pro-
moting “awareness of the uni-verse, astronomy and the moon in particular,” said Andy Howell, club president.
Amateur astronomer Bob 
O’Connell, who created a sub-committee inside the club for peo-ple interested in the moon, said he grew up watching the Apollo mis-
sions and moon landings.  Now, 
he said, the moon is his biggest interest.
“Anyone today can look at 
a high-resolution picture of the moon, but there is nothing that compares with putting your eye to the end of a telescope and see-ing it in person,” O’Connell said.

Trashformations: The Art of Recycling Art 
Show and Competition is taking applications for its 15th year this November. Students in middle school, high school and college can enter art pieces made from recyclable materi-als. The event will be at 5:30 p.m. Nov. 22 at the Florida Museum of Natural History.
The competition is sponsored by the Ala-
chua County Board of County Commission-ers, the Office of Waste Alternatives and the Florida Museum, according to a news re-
lease.“It’s a way to look at trash differently,” 
said Tiffany Ireland, education assistant at the 
museum.
The pieces must be made of at least 70 per-
cent recyclable materials, be freestanding and no taller than nine and a half feet.
The application is available on the Alachua 
County Public Works website and is due Nov. 8.
Ireland said in previous years, there have 
been anywhere from 30 to 80 entries for the competition and anticipates this year’s event to be big.
Molly Edwards, 22-year-old UF creative 
photography senior, said it is an interesting way to bring together students and the com-munity.
She said Trashformations is unique be-
cause it is not strictly one type of art.
“People are really eager to go green,” she 
said, “especially artists.”

more creative because of the competition’s recyclable-material restrictions.Art competition encourages participants to get trashy

Syllabi for all UF courses can 
now be found on one consoli-
dated Web page, just in time for 
class registration.
Student Government an-
nounced the launch of UF On-
line Course Syllabi, syllabus.
ufl.edu, a one-stop shop for syl-
labi for every class at UF, on its Facebook page Friday.
Academic Affairs Executive 
Secretary Seth Mahl said he be-
gan this semester with a goal to 
make classes more transparent and syllabi more accessible.
Instead of creating a pricey 
new database with syllabi, the 21-year-old UF finance senior created a website categorized by links to each college’s al-ready-existing syllabi database. 
The website, under UF’s do-
main, was free and simple to make, Mahl said.
The next step is to make sure 
the link is prominent on the UF Registrar’s website, he said.
“When students drop a 
class, no one wins,” Mahl said. “The more knowledge a stu-
dent has about a class, the more 
they know and can make a de-cision.”
Mahl’s idea piggybacked off 
Associate Provost for Under-graduate Affairs Bernard Mair’s work. At a Faculty Senate meet-ing during the 2011-2012 school year, Mair proposed each col-lege post class syllabi online to be publicly accessible at either 
the college or the department 
level, he said.
Every college took about one 
year to comply, as some faculty 
were concerned about infringe-
ment on intellectual property. Mair’s proposal also included a syllabus policy change that clarified what material should 
be posted, he said.
“It’s important for students 
to be aware of what’s expect-
ed,” Mair said.
Associate Provost for Aca-
demic and Faculty Affairs An-
gel Kwolek-Folland partnered 
with Mahl on the syllabus page and mediated with UF Infor-mation Technology to create 
the website.
“It took the work Dr. Mair 
had done one step farther,” Kwolek-Folland said.
UF plant science junior 
Danny Ghannoum, 20, said al-
though he hasn’t used the syl-labus page yet, he plans to use 
it for classes in the upcoming

The newly designed $100 bill be-
gan circulation Tuesday. The note’s 
high-tech design is the Federal Re-serve’s way of staying a step ahead of the counterfeiters, said Detective 
Matt Goeckel, Gainesville Police 
currency expert and task force liai-son with the U.S. Secret Service.
The note’s new security features 
include a blue, 3-D ribbon across the front that appears to reflect moving 100s and an inkwell that changes from copper to green when tilted.
“You look at Canadian cur-rencies, and it’s very colorful and harder to reproduce,” Goeckel said. “Ours is almost monotone.”
If someone suspects a counterfeit 
bill, the first thing they should do is call the police, said GPD spokesman Officer Ben Tobias.
“It gives us a chance to find out 
where the bill came from and if it’s part of a larger ring,” he said.
As far as the new bill dropping 
in the midst of the government shutdown, Goeckel said he was sur-prised.
The Federal Reserve was sched-
uled to release the bill in 2010 but didn’t because of production prob-lems.
Although the bills were released 
to financial institutions Tuesday, it may be a while before they hit the streets. 
The Wells Fargo branch in the 
Reitz Union hasn’t yet received a 
shipment of the new bills, but it’s 
expecting one soon, said store man-ager Scott Weaber.New colorful $100 bill debuts nationally
� BEES ARE THREATENED BY THE VARROA MITE.
EVAN ECHAVE
Alligator Contributing Writer
Honey, we shrunk the bee population.
In response to nationally declining populations, researchers 
at UF’s Entomology and Nematology Department are working to keep bees safer from harmful pesticides and noxious mites.
Liana Teigen, a research technician at UF’s entomology de-
partment, tracks bee colonies throughout the year and takes samples to see if the population numbers are changing.
“Right now, our losses are unsustainably high,” Teigen said.  “Beekeepers just can’t make up their numbers.”
The biggest threat to the honeybee is the varroa mite, which 
carries a virus that weakens the bees’ immune systems, mak-ing them less productive. Pesticides can reduce the amount of mites, but if too much is used, there won’t be any bees left to protect, Teigen said. Pesticides used on the crops that bees pol-linate may also contribute to lower honey yield.
To boost honey production, beekeepers like Teigen drip 
sugar solution into hives. This sugar spike can allow the bees to make an extra 50 pounds of honey.   
The continuing population decline for honeybees is no sur-
prise to Jeanette Klopchin, a 32-year-old research and extension technician at UF’s entomology department.
“The whole beekeeping phenomenon in the United States is, as a whole, imported,” she said.
Both honeybees and the crops they pollinate were trans-
planted here from Europe. Beekeeping was on the rise until the ‘80s, when chemical industries started making more pesticides and moved bees around for larger-scale farming, which ex-posed colonies to more chemicals in higher quantities.
Beekeepers are starting to use integrated pest management, 
which offers safer chemicals and nonchemical alternatives to traditional pest spraying, Klopchin said.
As the population of bees continues to shrink annually, Tei-
gen said she knows it will take a lot of willing helpers and a love for the honeybees to make any kind of impact.
“I don’t think there’s going to be some kind of magical solu-
tion,” she said.UF researchers work to help suffering honeybee population“It gives us a chance to 
find out where the bill came 
from and if it’s part of a 
larger ring.”

are looking to improve during the fall season. Read the story on page 14.ADAM LICHTENSTEIN

When LSU visited Ben Hill 
Grifﬁ  n Stadium last season, the re-sult was one of the grimiest, grit-tiest games Florida has played in 
recent years.
The Gators muscled out a 14-6 
victory on the shoulders of tail-
back Mike Gillislee, who pounded his way to 146 yards and scored 
both of UF’s touchdowns.
But this year’s iteration of the 
annual matchup will have a dif-ferent feel to it when the No. 17 
Gators (4-1, 3-0 Southeastern Con-
ference) play the No. 10 Tigers (5-1, 2-1 SEC) on Saturday in Tiger Stadium. 
In 2012, LSU’s biggest threat 
was its defense. The Tigers ﬁ  n-ished No. 9 in the country in rush defense and ranked eighth nation-ally in total defense.
This year, LSU is banking on its 
offense to carry the team. 
Tigers quarterback Zach 
Mettenberger has emerged after a disappointing 2012 campaign. The senior tossed only 12 touchdowns last year and seven interceptions. He has already eclipsed the ﬁ  rst mark — Mettenberger has thrown 15 touchdowns through six games — while keeping turnovers to a minimum. “He throwing that thing, man,” 
linebacker Antonio Morrison said. “[He’s] looking like a NFL quar-terback.”
Mettenberger is averaging 89 
more yards per game this season than he did in 2012. His comple-tion percentage is up 9.4 points. 
“He’s more mature,” defensive 
back Jaylen Watkins said. “He has a year under his belt at LSU with those receivers.
“He has a connection with all 
three of them. It’s a really good connection at that.”
The Tigers return their top re-
ceiving threat, Odell Beckham Jr. The junior wideout ﬁ  nished last season with 713 yards on 43 recep-tions and will likely surpass those numbers this season.
Beckham has already accumu-
lated 686 yards on 35 receptions 
and has brought in six touch-
downs. Last year, the biggest im-pact he had in the game against 
UF was fumbling a 56-yard pass 
from Mettenberger that Matt Elam 
punched out and De’Ante Saun-
ders recovered.
Both Elam and Saunders are 
gone, but Beckham returns.
“He’s not a big guy, but he’s 
very fast,” Watkins said. “He plays great. That’s the same for all of [the receivers]. They’re not tall, but they can all go up and get the ball like they are 6-3, 6-4.”
Florida rattled Mettenberger

Florida defense to be tested by offense-oriented LSU
ADAM PINCUS
Alligator Staff Writer @adamDpincus
Offensive coordinator Brent Pease 
was in a good mood Tuesday, and it 
was not just because it was his 49th birthday.
Despite Florida going 11-2 and 
earning a trip to the Sugar Bowl dur-ing Pease’s ﬁ  rst year in Gainesville, the Gators’ offense struggled to match the performance of its defense for most of last season. 
Lately, that has not been a prob-
lem, which has Pease feeling good. 
Since redshirt junior quarterback 
Tyler Murphy took control during the 
ﬁ  rst quarter against Tennessee, Flori-
da’s offense has been clicking. 
Murphy has completed 72 per-
cent of his passes while throwing ﬁ  ve touchdowns to just one interception. Solomon Patton has also emerged as a big-play threat, and the offensive line has gotten healthier.
“Everybody’s feeling good,” Pease 
said. 
No. 17 Florida (4-
1, 3-0 Southeastern Conference) trav-els to No. 10 LSU (5-1, 2-1 SEC) for a Saturday afternoon matchup that might ﬁ  nd the Gators in a Bayou shootout. LSU averages 45.5 points 
per game and boasts the SEC’s most efﬁ  cient quarterback in Zach Metten-berger.
“We’re capable of scoring what-
ever we have to,” Pease said. “That’s what we’ve got to have the mentality of. I think it’s just our kids will rise to Gators offense improvingFIRE JOE MORGAN
Florida’s most recent trip to 
Tiger Stadium could have taken place in the Colos-
seum — yeah, the Roman one. 
Top-ranked LSU, backed 
by a frenzied crowd of 93,022, 
tore apart the hapless and over-matched Gators in a 41-11 vic-tory on Oct. 8, 2011, in Baton 
Rouge, La.
Florida will defeat LSU on Saturday be-
cause of what happened two years ago.
Instead of simply burning clock when 
the fourth quarter rolled around, LSU threw 
haymakers. The Tigers mocked the Gators.
With the Tigers leading 27-11 early in the 
fourth quarter, Billy Gonzales, the LSU re-ceivers coach and passing game coordinator who left the UF’s staff on bad terms follow-
ing the 2009 season, dialed up a late jump 
pass play from the 2-yard line for a touch-down.
After padding the lead with the same play 
Florida debuted during a 23-10 win against LSU in 2006, the Tigers’ sideline erupted in cheers and laughter.Embarrassed, humiliated and 
distraught, those Gators were broken. 
Knee-deep in the wreckage, 
Muschamp got to work. That be-gan by embracing the moment.
“I told the guys all along in 
the offseason and while it was 
going on, ‘Don’t ever forget the 
feeling you have right now,’” 
Muschamp said on Oct. 1, 2012. “If you’re truly a competitive guy, it ought to really mo-tivate you not to be in that situation again.”
Two more October defeats and the infa-
mous “We are soft” speech followed, but the Gators as you know them now were born 
following that bloody Saturday in Death 
Valley. What made UF great all of last season and so far this year was absent that day.
LSU dominated the run game, racking 
up 238 yards on 49 carries. Defensively, the Tigers forced two fumbles and limited the Gators to only 113 yards on 32 rush at-tempts.

Alex Holston blocks the ball during Florida’s three-set win against Texas 
A&M on Friday in the O’Connell Center. Holston hit .567 last weekend.
RJ SCHAFFER
Alligator Writer @rjschaffer 
Florida was forced to mount a three-set comeback 
to survive its most recent home matchup against 
Kentucky.
The No. 2 Gators could have an easier time against 
the Wildcats on Friday night thanks to the emergence of freshman right-side hitter Alex Holston. 
“Our offensive numbers have just been stagger-
ing,” coach Mary Wise said. 
The Gators are not just dominating matches — 
Florida has not lost a set since Sept. 14 against West-ern Michigan — they are hitting the ball at one of the best clips in the nation. 
UF is fourth in the nation in kills per set, averag-
ing 15.06 per game and second in the nation in hit-ting percentage at .349.
Holston, who has adapted to Wise’s system quick-
ly, has contributed to those high marks despite being a true freshman. “For her to put up the numbers she’s doing — low 
error and highly efﬁ  cient,” Wise said. “That’s the 
best combination.”  
Holston was named Southeastern Conference 
Freshman of the Week after her performances against 
Texas A&M and Alabama last weekend. 
She hit .567 in the two matches but was especial-
ly good against the Crimson Tide; she hit .727 with eight kills in the Gators’ three-set victory.
One of Holston’s biggest strengths has been her 
consistency. 
She recorded only one error during the weekend 
and has only 23 attack errors this season — four few-er than senior middle blocker Chloe Mann. Freshman leading strong UF offenseTENNIS

Despite losing several critical 
players from last season, women’s 
tennis coach Roland Thornqvist is pleased with the Gators’ roster.
Thornqvist expects to see several 
of his seven players ranked among the top-10 players in the nation when Florida opens its spring sea-son against Louisville on Jan. 25.  
“We have that kind of talent,” 
Thornqvist said. “We’re heading in the right direction.”
For Bryan Shelton, coach of the 
men’s team, the fall preseason, which includes seven tournament appearances, is more about devel-opment.  
“We know that after last year 
there was a little bit of a gap be-tween us and some of the top teams in the country,” Shelton said. “Our goal is to make that gap smaller and smaller.”
Florida’s men ﬁ  nished 15-11 
a year ago and ended the season ranked No. 16. The women’s side enjoyed more success, falling short of a third straight national title by losing to Stanford in the NCAA semiﬁ  nals.
Both teams left their respective ITA tournaments without trophies or titles last weekend. Two play-ers from each team advanced to the main singles draws of the All-American tourneys but lost in the ﬁ  rst round. 
Brianna Morgan and Soﬁ  e Oyen 
each lost in two sets in the women’s tournament. For the men, Florent 
Diep fell 7-6, 7-5, while Stephane 
Piro put up a three-set battle before falling 6-7 (4), 6-4, 6-3.
Both teams added three fresh-
men to each of their rosters this sum-mer. Of the three newcomers on the men’s team, Shelton recognized El-liott Orkin as a standout performer. “It’s a little bit 
rare for a fresh-man to come out with a fearless mentality, but he’s been able to 
do that from the start,” Shelton said. 
Orkin has competed in both of 
the team’s tournament appearances. He and teammate Gordon Watson survived all four qualifying rounds to advance to the All-American dou-bles main draw before losing in the third round. 
Belinda Woolcock, who earned an ITA top-10 ranking among new-comers, has starred on the women’s side. Woolcock has competed at ev-ery Florida tournament so far this year.
“She’s getting better every time 
out,” Thornqvist said. “She can play big when she needs to, and she’s also willing to play defense when 
the ball tells her to.”
All three of the freshmen on the 
women’s team will play their ﬁ  rst 
matches on UF courts this weekend during the Bedford Cup, which runs Thursday through Sunday.

that’s the best combination.
Mary Wise
UF coachwhen he visited The Swamp last year. The 
defense sacked him four times and held LSU’s running backs to 59 yards, making Tigers offensive coordinator Greg Studra-
wa put the ball in Mettenberger’s hands. 
Mettenberger completed fewer than 
half of his passes in the absence of a run-
ning game, but now LSU has a more po-
tent ground attack and a new offensive 
coordinator to go with it.Tigers coach Les Miles brought in Cam 
Cameron in the offseason, and under 
Cameron, LSU is averaging 197.3 yards per game on the ground.
Halfback Jeremy Hill has been elec-
tric for the Tigers this year, averaging 7.5 yards per carry and 118.8 yards per game.
Against Florida last year, Hill had the 
best average of any LSU running back — rushing for 8 yards on two carries. The Gators return a rush defense just as strong as the one that stifled the Tigers last year.
“They’re very talented,” coach Will 
Muschamp said. “Jeremy Hill, (Terrence) Magee, (Alfred) Blue, (Kenny) Hilliard. All guys that are going to be physical and get the ball north and south.”
It is going to be a battle of strengths 
when Florida goes to Baton Rouge, La., on Saturday. Both teams will try to estab-lish their identities and take control of the game. 
The Tigers will try to neutralize the Gators’ elite defense with a combination of a deep passing game and explosive running attack. 
Florida will attempt to replicate last 
season’s result with the same method — pound the ball on the ground and rock LSU with the defense.
But Muschamp said he did not care 
how Florida wins, as long as the Gators come back with a victory.
“I want to win.,” he said. “If it takes 
51-50, let’s go.”WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 9, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 15

Ben Hill Griffin Stadium. Coach Will Muschamp named Garcia the top offensive lineman against Arkansas.
Gators tougher since ‘11
air.
LSU torched the Florida second-
ary with 215 passing yards on only 
14 attempts.
Meanwhile, Jacoby Brissett, 
tasked with doing the improbable in his first career start, didn’t do much else before or after hitting Andre Debose for a 65-yard touch-down pass. Brissett, who threw two interceptions and was under-standably rattled, could not be the game manager Florida expects Ty-ler Murphy to be on Saturday.
Even the defense bottomed out, 
forcing no turnovers and giving up 453 yards at a clip of 7.2 per play — three more than the 4.2 yards UF has allowed per play since 2012 began.
The Gators have obviously im-
proved in each area since then, but that alone will not guarantee a win. 
Neither does LSU’s defense being 
weaker than usual due mostly to the inexperience of an otherwise talented unit.
Florida is a much tougher foot-ball team, even more so than last year’s squad. The Gators haven’t 
blinked since losing Dominique 
Easley and Jeff Driskel for the sea-son.
The defense, which lost seven 
starters from 2012, has helped continue the Gators’ streak of sur-rendering 20 points or fewer in 12 straight Southeastern Conference games.
The offense is defying preseason 
expectations under the direction of the cool-headed Murphy, whose resolve under pressure and adver-sity has been admirable.
Hell, Jon Halapio, who was al-
ready playing at risk of re-tearing his left pectoral muscle, came back into the Tennessee game after brief-
ly leaving due to a bleeding eye.
The “man down, man up” 
mantra may sound corny and con-
trived, but damn it if it isn’t perti-nent to this team. The Gators are tough, and the memories of Baton Rouge sting.
At the risk of sounding awfully 
cliché, tough guys don’t get mad. 
They get even.JOe , from page 13
Taylor redshirt possible 
the occasion. It’s not like we can’t 
or shouldn’t do it.”
Freshman running back may 
redshirt: Kelvin Taylor was a fan favorite before playing a snap for 
the Gators but has been seldom 
used this season. Through five games, the freshman tailback has 46 yards on only six carries. 
Taylor has not had a rushing at-
tempt since Florida defeated Ten-nessee on Sept. 21, and his game action against Arkansas was lim-ited to victory kneel-downs. 
Although he can not apply for 
a regular redshirt, he can receive a medical redshirt if he does not appear past the sixth game of the season, does not appear in more than four games and has a prov-able injury. Florida plays its sixth game on Saturday.
“He practices hard,” Pease 
said. “He’s a good kid. He’s got a good attitude. 
“He is a good player, and I just 
want to see him continue to do the things and have some patience.”Left guard improving: Max 
Garcia has gotten confused on campus for  fellow offensive line-man Jon Halapio because of their similar hairstyles. Each features long, black hair usually knotted in a pony tail or held back by a headband. 
If the Maryland transfer con-
tinues playing like he did against Arkansas, he might be mistaken for Halapio because of his perfor-mance on the field as well.
Coach Will Muschamp award-
ed Garcia with the team’s top of-fensive lineman honor on Mon-
day following his performance 
during Florida’s 30-10 victory 
against Arkansas. Garcia sat out 
last season after transferring from Maryland, where he started 12 games in 2011.
“You know the first two games 
were probably just kind of get-ting back into football,” Garcia said. “It had been so long, back 
in 2011, since I last played college 
football. So yeah, I feel like the game has been slowing down for me, and I’m just trying to keep it going.”nOTeS , from page 13MICHELLE PROVENZANO

Liz Slattery makes the most of her lim-
ited playing time.
The freshman midﬁ  elder entered Sun-
day’s match against Auburn in the 26th 
minute and made her presence known at James G. Pressly Stadium.
Slattery won possession in the midﬁ  eld, 
saw junior forward Jillian Graff in the at-tacking third and spun a pass to her. Graff made the half-volley touch and sunk the ball into the net from 15 yards out.
Slattery earned her 
ﬁ  rst career assist from Graff’s goal and cush-ioned the Gators’ lead 
en route to a 3-0 victory against the Ti-
gers. 
“That’s a pretty sophisticated ball that 
she played,” coach Becky Burleigh said. 
“It’s still not an easy goal for Jillian to ﬁ  n-ish, but it certainly sprung her to get that 
opportunity.”
It was not only Slattery’s assist that 
grabbed attention. She was dynamic in the 
midﬁ  eld, gaining possession and creating 
opportunities in the opposing half.
“She won more 50-50 balls than the 
entire Auburn team,” Burleigh said. “She 
was at 11 or 12 just by herself, which is a pretty incredible stat.”
Although the 5-foot-5 freshman is not 
a physically imposing player, she consis-tently pressures opponents.
“She just really works hard to win those 
balls,” Burleigh said. “She gets herself in a good position. She 
reads the ball well, and then what she can do in her technical ability is also impor-tant. She’s kind of working hard on both 
sides of the ball.”
Burleigh said after the team’s 2-1 dou-
ble-overtime loss to South Carolina that 
she wants her players to show collective toughness.
Although fellow freshman Pamela Be-
gic suffered an unspeciﬁ  ed injury against Auburn, the Gators can look to Slattery 
and other midﬁ  elders for depth.
“Every single game, I try to get more 
and more minutes,” Slattery said. 
“Every time I go in the game, I know it’s an opportunity to show that I can be on 
the ﬁ  eld with everyone. When I get on the ﬁ  eld I work as hard as I possibly can.”
In the 12 games she has made an ap-
pearance, Slattery has scored one goal and notched one assist — a less impressive stat line compared to the 26 goals and 13 as-sists she racked up in her junior year at 
Cincinnati Indian Hill High School.
“You come in here, and you’re with 
girls who are just as good, if not better 
than you, so it’s hard to adjust to that,” Slattery said. 
“Getting my conﬁ  dence up to where 
everyone else’s was, to the point where I knew I could play with them still and I could still be an impact on the team, has probably been the best thing for me.”
Freshman to play for national team:
Freshman forward Savannah Jordan will be competing with the U.S. U-18 Women’s National Team in camps with the U-17 Women’s National Team in Lakeland 
Ranch from Oct. 13-19. 
“It’s a great honor and a great opportu-
nity,” Jordan said. “I’m excited to get into 
a new environment and kind of play with different players and see what I can do. 
“I think it will help me bring new things 
to the team.”16, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 9, 2013
