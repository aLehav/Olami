Coach Billy Donovan cuts down the net following Florida’s 62-52 win over Dayton on Saturday in FedExForum in Memphis, Tenn.
Florida advanced to its ﬁ  rst Final Four since 2007 and will play UConn in Arlington, Texas, on Saturday at 6:09 p.m.LANDON WATNICK

MEMPHIS, Tenn. — As Scottie Wilbekin 
dribbled out the ﬁ  nal seconds remaining on 
the clock, Patric Young held his head in dis-belief while Will Yeguete embraced him. At the same time, Casey Prather yelled a cry of 
joy, bolting to the ﬂ  oor and then chest-bump-
ing teammate Dorian Finney-Smith.
For this group, it was an emotional mo-
ment four years in the making. At last, after three straight Elite Eight exits, Florida had ﬁ  nally gotten over the hump.
Behind Wilbekin’s 23 points, No. 1 seed 
Florida (36-2) held off No. 11 seed Dayton 62-52 on Saturday to reach the Final Four for 
the ﬁ  rst time since 2007 and the fourth time 
under coach Billy Donovan. Now, the Gators will prepare for a Final Four date next Satur-day at 6:09 p.m. in Arlington, Texas, with No. 7 seed UConn, which defeated fourth-seeded Michigan State 60-54 on Sunday in Madison Square Garden. 
After Saturday’s win, Florida players 
danced at center court, hoisted the Final Four 
trophy and then cut down the nets as “Cele-
bration” by Kool & the Gang blared through the FedExForum speakers. The scene was a 180-degree turn from the previous three years, when UF suffered losses to Butler (74-71 in overtime), Louisville (72-68) and Michi-gan (79-59) in three consecutive Elite Eight appearances.
“Tears were in my eyes again,” Young 
said, “but it was of joy this time.”
Dayton, the Cinderella of this year’s tour-
nament, hung with Florida for much of the ﬁ  rst half. The Flyers (26-11) led 21-19 at the 6:58 mark thanks to four three-pointers, but UF closed out the half on a 19-3 run.
Wilbekin fueled the rally, scoring 11 FINALLY

After 82 years of hosting 
Gator Growl in the Swamp, the 
production team is setting its sights on a smaller venue.
The Gator Growl committee 
announced Sunday that Gator Growl 2014, themed “Limit-less,” will be moved from Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium to Flavet Field. 
The pep rally will be held  Oct. 17 at 7 p.m. as the con-clusion of UF’s Homecoming week.
The decision to change 
the location came after Gator Growl producers surveyed stu-
dents, alumni and Gainesville 
residents.
“We had an overwhelming 
response that people wanted a more intimate show. They want it to be more interactive,” said Devin McDaniel, executive Gator Growl ’14 leaves

The Levin College of Law will 
welcome a temporary new dean in 
the coming months. 
UF law professor George Daw-
son will postpone his retirement to 
take over as interim dean for the col-
lege starting July 15. He will replace current dean Bob Jerry. 
Dawson’s appointment as inter-
im dean comes after the controver-sial failed law dean search.
With $90,000 spent on the search 
and three ﬁ  nalists to choose from, UF President Bernie Machen ended the search without selecting a dean for the college.
Dawson, who has been a part of 
the law school for 33 years, said the position will be challenging, but he’s looking forward to it.  
“I’m very invested in the law 
school, and I will do what I can to have it develop and progress within the next year,” he said. “Hopefully at the end of the year there will be a 
permanent dean.”
Dawson has previously served 
as the law school’s associate dean 
for academic affairs from 1996 to 2000.
Jerry wrote in an email that he 
believes Dawson will make a great dean. 
“He is an outstanding colleague 
who will do a splendid job of lead-ing the school as the interim dean,” he said. “I speak for many when I say President Machen made an excellent decision in proposing George.”Law prof George Dawson to become

Skulls seem to be in vogue at the 
C.A. Pound Human Identification 
Laboratory.
The director, Michael Warren, 
wears a small orange-and-blue skull 
pin on his sport jacket lapel: an ad-
aptation of the division’s logo.
Behind his desk, a little metal 
skeleton plays a guitar. By his computer, there’s a black box with bony, grinning faces etched into the wood.
And down the hallway, there’s 
an entire room filled with skulls. 
Some are charred, broken, sliced 
in half. They’re scattered across five long worktables, grouped into skeletons with various bones atop brown paper and white foam.
It’s far from being a morbid ob-
session with death. The UF profes-sor and graduate students who run this lab are professionals who have 
analyzed evidence in some of the 
most high-profile cases in the state. The clues they find through skel-etal examination often unlock the stories of how people died and can ultimately provide the information necessary to solve missing persons cases.
…
The lab is tucked at the back of 
UF's Cancer and Genetics Research Complex. Its unassuming and near-ly unmarked entrance looks like a loading dock.
Fluorescent lights stripe the ceil-
ing. Red evidence tape rolls lay among the bones and manila files. Ten small, glass bottles filled half-way with what looks like whiskey contain 10 severed fingers.
On a side table sit two shallow 
dishes filled with gray sand — cre-mation ashes. Warren sifts through 
one of the dishes to reveal small, 
shiny pellets. That’s evidence of surgical operations, he says.  
In the narrow, metallic room 
Warren says is used for “separat-ing the soft tissue from the bones,” a 7-or-so-foot-long table takes cen-ter stage. The stainless-steel top is like a tray several inches deep. But 
the room isn’t only used for serious 
casework — occasionally, the grad-uate students get to do educational projects there.
To demonstrate, Warren snaps 
on rubber gloves. He takes the lid off of a large trash can next to the dissection table and plunges his hands into the murky depths of so-
lution. He comes up with the entire 
severed arm of a gorilla.
Everything is perfectly intact, 
including the oily black fur and 2-inch fingernails, until the upper arm. Skin and tissue are flapping where it’s been sliced open and dissected to various levels. A male gorilla died at the Jacksonville Zoo, 
and Warren’s students are using it 
to learn about the human body be-cause the two systems are so simi-lar.
A small window into the walk-
in freezer shows what looks like a grocery store meat locker with squishy, brown and bloody matter stacked in plastic bags. Families, 
Warren explains, don’t want the 
tissue. They want the clean bones of their loved ones to bury. 
The lab incinerates the tissue, and a biohazard truck comes once a week in the wee hours of the morn-ing to whisk the waste away.
…
Michael Warren spent 15 years 
as a paramedic before he started dealing with bones.
“I had seen people get injured 
for 15 years, so I understood the mechanisms of injury and how that occurs in living people,” he says.
When he decided to go back to 
school, he chose anthropology. He wanted to study ancient Florid-ians. Instead, he found forensic an-thropology, the science that spans 
cultures, continents and lifestyles 
united by something revered and respected in every culture: death and human remains.
“Anthropology was always in-
teresting to me: the human condi-tion and how people are different all over the world and how people are the same all over the world,” Warren says.
When he entered the profession 
more than two decades ago, TV 
shows like “Bones” and “Criminal 
Minds” weren’t around to popular-ize the branch of study. It was often a quiet, unnoticed discipline. But its effects are widespread.
During his time at the Pound 
Lab, Warren and associates have been called to help identify victims in mass disasters such as plane 
crashes and hurricanes. 
He’s worked in Bosnia and Thai-
land on cases that resulted from 
ethnic cleansing and human rights violations. He’s flown to New York to testify. He examined the remains of Caylee Anthony and Haley Cum-mings. In the 2012 Gainesville I-75 crashes, he identified three of the 
bodies.
Bruce Goldberger, a UF profes-
sor and director of toxicology in 
the College of Medicine’s pathol-ogy, immunology and laboratory medicine department, worked with the lab on the Caylee Anthony case. He calls the lab a “very valuable re-source” — an integral part of UF’s kaleidoscope of resources.
“Having the anthropology lab 
here is just one chunk of that diver-sity, that very important diversity,” he says.
Warren joined the lab as a grad-
uate student when the 1989 disap-pearance of UF student Tiffany 
Sessions was still fresh in the com-
munity's memory.
Every time a new condo would 
start to go up in the area, people from the lab would be summoned out to vet the area — just to make sure her body wasn’t buried at the site.
Through the years, the lab has 
worked with agencies such as the FBI and cold-case detectives to fol-low up on leads that appeared rel-evant to the case.In February, law enforcement of-
ficials announced serial killer Paul Rowles as the official suspect in the 25-year cold case. Warren was at the site for the announcement.
“She’s kind of a part of the legacy 
of the lab because all the students, my current students, know about her,” he says.
Warren keeps a master file on 
Sessions containing copies of evi-dence he’s compiled through the years. When people call to say they’ve found a skeleton, he takes the file with him, just in case.
But that’s not necessary.  He has 
Sessions’ dental pattern and physi-
cal characteristics memorized.
“If I see her, I’ll know it’s her,” 
Warren says.
…Looking toward the future, War-
ren wants to add a DNA analysis 
lab.
As of now, the lab is forced to 
send DNA to Texas for testing. The 
waiting period can be up to three 
months. 
Funding is one roadblock: 
Warren says it would take about $330,000 to get the DNA lab set up. Lack of interest is another.
Maranda Kles, a lab affiliate and 
a UF consulting forensic anthropol-ogist, says adding the DNA analysis 
capabilities  “would speed up the 
process” and give students another avenue to learn. It could become a place that helps state and local law enforcement officials get the genetic information they need to nail down answers.
If they can ever get the resources, 
Warren says the team plans to trans-
form a little room off of the main lab 
floor. It used to be a darkroom.
For now, the ex-darkroom is 
stacked with rough wooden crates containing skeletons on loan from Thailand for the students to study.
Although his job is highly scien-
tific and takes place in a sterile lab, Warren is warm and personable. 
He says he doesn’t dream about his 
cases, but it does bother him when he works on cases that involve de-ceased children. 
There’s a rule in the lab: If a case 
starts bothering you, you have to tell somebody. The colleagues coun-sel each other and help each other move forward.
All cases, even the low-profile 
ones, are significant.  
“They’re all important to some-
body,” he says.
So in the name of science and 
the interest of the families involved, 
Warren will stick with bones. 
That’s what he’s always done. 
He’s never interviewed a criminal or 
chased down a suspect. Sometimes people bring clothing or other items to supplement physical evidence, but Warren turns it away.
“I don’t want that. I’m not an 
expert in that,” he says. “We just do 
the bones.”MONDAY, MARCH 31, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 3

producer of Gator Growl. 
The decision was also derived 
from financial and logistical con-
cerns. Flavet Field is a cheaper ven-
ue, and the committee was strug-
gling to find someone who could perform in the Swamp.Although the stadium can seat 
90,000, attendance numbers have been dropping below 30,000 since 2008, with the exception of about 36,000 in 2009. 
Ticket sales dropped to roughly 
20,000 in 2012 and fell further to 15,000 in 2013, according to an 
email from former Florida Blue Key President Brock Hankins. 
McDaniel noted that Flavet 
Field’s size gives the pep rally room 
to grow from last year’s attendance of 15,000 while reducing a need for extensive stage setup. 
McDaniel said that she felt the 
theme “Limitless” was conducive 
of the new venue.“There are endless possibilities, 
and there’s just so much we could 
do with this venue,” she said. “When we’re on Flavet Field, there are no limits to what we can and cannot do.”
Despite the “Limitless” theme, 
there are plans in place for limita-
tions on the venue. 
The committee is discussing 
the construction of a large fence 
around the field to ensure that only ticket holders can attend the giant pep rally.
Students like Kristen Urichko, 
who attended a jazz festival on Fla-vet Field, feel a part of the appeal of the new venue is the ability to 
attend and leave freely.
“People were just coming and 
going in,” said the 19-year-old UF 
health sciences freshman. “I loved that feeling, being outside with people, just on a blanket.”
Another issue with the venue 
comes in the form of seating. 
With the permanent bleach-
ers of the stadium gone, the Gator Growl committee must also deal with the issue of finding seating for the alumni and attendees uncom-fortable with spending three hours standing or sitting on a blanket.
“We are discussing bleacher 
seating and VIP tents for those who 
would be willing to pay more,” 
McDaniel said.

But he’s not an officer.  Alachua County Sheriff’s 
Office deputies arrested the 56-year-old Alabama man Thursday night on charges of impersonating a police officer, according to an arrest report.

9:45 p.m., 
two reports 
came in about a white Ford Crown Victoria with a siren and strobe light driving north

First, Winner activated his

During questioning, Winner 
said he was trying to signal to the witness he didn’t have his tail lights on, according to the report. Police found a police radio and a center console for emergency lights inside Win-ner’s car.

Members of Gainesville’s Citizen’s Co-op 
met Sunday to discuss the future of the store, 
which has been addled with conflicts among its founders, board of directors and members.
About 60 people attended the meeting held 
at the Civic Media Center to voice their concerns about the store’s financial viability and contro-versies surrounding the recent firing of five em-ployees.
Now, the members are petitioning to have 
the board of directors send out a notice to the store’s roughly 1,700 members announcing a meeting to vote on three measures on May 4. 
Members will vote on removing the current 
board of directors, electing an interim board of directors and reinstating the five workers fired on March 24.Eleanor Sommer, a member and investor of 
the co-op, said the board’s actions have upset a large number of members and investors, and they should step aside.
“We just want it to be run in favor of the 
members and investors who supported it,” 
Sommer said.
Member Katie Conley said she agrees the 
board should remove itself from the equation 
because “they’re out of touch.”At meeting, co-op members discuss store’s future� IT WILL COME OUT APRIL 18.

The UF Hispanic Communicators 
Association is releasing a new, dual-lan-
guage magazine called Communicate that will focus on communications with a broad focus of Hispanic issues. 
The release date is April 18, and the 
magazine will be available in print and online. The online version will feature photos, videos and other multimedia work submitted by students. 
The magazine was created in hopes 
of giving students experience publish-ing their work and learning more about the Hispanic community, said Stephanie 
Bechara, the 24-year-old graduate stu-dent adviser of the club.
“The only thing that we have on cam-
pus that gives student that platform is 
Noticias WUFT, the radio show,” she said. “We can have students report in their own language about things they love and really cater to Latinos in the 
community.”
The magazine, funded by Student 
Government, has a budget of $1,000.

Maude’s Classic Cafe is offering a new way 
for its customers to recharge.
A solar-powered charging station for elec-
tronic devices was installed earlier this month 
at the downtown Gainesville coffee shop lo-
cated at 101 SE Second Place.
Matthew Wrighton, the owner of the cafe, 
said he was approached by Gainesville-based 
Pure Energy Solar to install the solar-powered station, otherwise known as RE-charge. The shop has the one station on the outdoor patio.
“The reaction has been very positive,” he 
said. “Customers are asking a lot of questions about how it works.”
The station, which is a metal table with a 
solar panel attached to a pole in the middle, has become the seat of choice for customers, Wrighton said. It’s equipped with nine electric outlets and 14 USB outlets. 
Wayne Irwin, the director of engineering 
and owner of Pure Energy Solar, said the cafe was an appropriate spot because many cus-tomers use electronic devices in the outdoor 
patio.
“I think the RE-charge station really en-
lightens people to the reality that solar energy 
is abundant and never-ending,” Irwin said.
Irwin saie he hopes the charging station 
will be jumpstart solar energy use for other lo-cal businesses.
“I’m looking to see these implemented 
throughout our community,” Irwin said. 
The baseline price to purchase one of the 
stations is $3,000, he said, but the govern-ment offers a 30-percent Federal Income Tax Credit.
Shannon Nehiley, an 18-year-old UF sus-
tainability and the built environment fresh-man, recently used the station to charge her iPhone. She said she thinks it’s an environ-mentally friendly option.Maude’s customers can charge

Aishwarya Potdar’s hair never 
stays long.
The 21-year-old grows out her 
thick, dark brown locks for about 
three years before having them chopped to be made into wigs for cancer patients. 
“It’s part of my routine now,” 
said the UF applied physiology and kinesiology junior. “I have so much hair, and so many people don’t have any.”
Potdar, who has donated her hair 
three times, was one of more than 50 girls aged 18 to 22 who left the Stephen C. O’Connell Center with 
significantly shorter hair after Fri-
day’s hair cutting ceremony at UF’s Relay for Life. 
The relay is an overnight fund-
raising walk dedicated to raising 
awareness and fighting back against 
the disease. 
The turnout was one of the best 
in the four years Beach Break Salon 
has been participating in the event, 
said 20-year-old senior stylist Cait-lin Achord.
Nine stylists from the salon, lo-
cated at 603 W. University Ave., helped with braiding, tying and cut-ting hair on stage.
“Luckily, we had the right 
amount of people and knowledge … to get everyone taken care of,” she said.
She said most women getting their hair cut sign up ahead of time, 
but for some it’s a “spur-of-the-mo-
ment thing.”
Beach Break also collects pony-
tails throughout the year and then donates them after relay, Achord 
said. This year, the salon collected 
more than 325 ponytails.
Where the hair is donated to de-
pends on if it has been color treated. 
She said it is sent to either Locks 
of Love, which requires at least 10 inches of hair, or to Pantene Beauti-ful Lengths, which requires a mini-
mum of 8 inches and doesn’t accept 
treated hair.
Potdar, whose aunt and child-
hood best friend’s father both died from cancer, said donating every 
few years is one small way she can 
make a difference. 
“If I have the resources to make 
someone’s life better, I might as well 
use them,” she said. “(Hair) doesn’t 
seem like a big deal, but it’s kind of like someone’s identity.”MONDAY, MARCH 31, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 5

Students donate hair at UF Relay for Life
March 31, 1988
More than 300 students and faculty gathered 
at a flat piece of land outlined with chalk for a ground-breaking ceremony on campus — a place that would one day become the first major art mu-seum at a Florida university: the Samuel P. Harn Museum of Art. The Florida legislature added $4 million to the Harn family’s $3 million donation to undertake the project, according to Alligator ar-chives. 
March 31, 2003An Alpha Epsilon Phi sister walked to her car 
from her sorority’s house and was shocked to find a swastika drawn in condensation on her rear win-dow. At another sorority house, a car drove by and its passengers yelled “death to the Jews,” according to Alligator archives. The campus rabbi said every-one was taking the incidents seriously, and Univer-sity Police was notified. He noted Gainesville as a place that is home to one of the largest campus-based Jewish communities in the nation, and the incident is the minority to the rule. 
April 1, 2010About 40 UF proferssors and students worked 
on the world’s largest particle accelerator in Swit-zerland — the Large Hadron Collider — as part of an international collaberation. The collider broke a small-scale energy record. It also helped scientists answer questions they’d been asking for decades, such as an explanation for dark, or invisible mat-ter, that makes up 20 percent of the universe, said Guenakh Mitselmakher, who led the UF research team. It took $10 billion to build the collider and 17 years to build the detector that collects its data.

For the second year in a row, Alachua 
cracked Florida’s top 20 in a nationwide 
county health ranking. 
The study, conducted by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Uni-
versity of Wisconsin Population Health In-
stitute, used data from national sources to illustrate trends and outline problems for counties.
Roger Dolz, quality improvement pro-
gram administrator for Florida Department of Health in Alachua County, said he and other officials were proud of the county’s high ranking — 17th in health outcomes and second in health factors out of a total of 67 
counties.
“We are No. 1 in access to care, as well 
as in clinical care,” Dolz said, adding that 
the UF community and the three major hos-pitals in the area contribute to the county’s success.
Despite the high overall ranking, Alachua 
ranked lower in some individual categories such as community safety and air-and-water quality. The county ranked No. 34 in both.
For some students, like first-year phar-
macy student Hana Cho, the county’s em-phasis on health was a deciding factor for attending college there. Cho said she chose UF in part due to the proximity to UF Health Shands Hospital.
“I believe that UF and the county play a 
role and are a pioneer in the advancement of health care,” she said. Alachua County places highly in national health rankingsReader response

The semester is starting to wind down, and ﬁ  nals 
week is looming. The library is getting more crowd-
ed, and students are spending more time on cam-
pus to compensate for how little they’ve paid attention all semester.
But studying too much can cause stress and make it 
hard to focus. It’s important to take breaks, and what’s better than a sex break?
If you’re already on campus, why bother leaving just 
to get some afternoon — or morning or evening — de-light? 
Rollins College’s newspaper, “The Sandspur,” recently 
published an article talking about the wonders of public 
sex: “Sex in public is often frowned upon as illegal and 
primitive. But those two justiﬁ  cations are exactly what 
make it so exciting.” 
I was so inspired, I went around our own alma mater 
to ﬁ  nd the best places to get down and get dirty. 
The football ﬁ  eld is probably the most cliche place to 
have sex on campus, which is why it should be ﬁ  rst on your list. The thrill of having to jump over a few fences 
— sorry University Police and administration — and stay 
quiet to avoid getting caught will make the encounter much hotter. 
You’re not a true Gator fan unless you actually do it 
on Florida Field. And what’s the point of making all the 
effort if you don’t scream something like “Go Gators!” or 
“I love Tim Tebow!” when you orgasm?
The library is another stereotypical place to have sex 
on campus. However, it’s a lot less realistic than the foot-
ball ﬁ  eld, if only because it’s more crowded.
I’m not saying it’s impossible — just be sure to wait for 
a time when there are fewer panicked students cramming 
for exams. If you’re trying to do the dirty deed in the actu-
al stacks, make sure to pick a section that isn’t frequently 
visited — and let’s be honest, isn’t that all of them?
I will caution you to focus on Library West or Marston, 
though. Try to avoid the lawbrary at all costs, unless you are an actual law student. A recent guest column point-
ed out that law students are very 
territorial, so I doubt they would 
take kindly to undergraduates 
ﬁ  lling their quiet lawbrary with 
the sounds of something a lot 
more fun than studying. Besides, the building is made up of glass 
walls, making it harder to get away with. 
Perhaps easiest to accomplish, and in my opinion, the 
most exciting option, is a classroom. A handful of build-
ings on campus leave their classroom doors unlocked at 
night, making them perfect sexcapade locations. 
Classrooms provide more privacy than other public 
locations but still give you the thrill of potentially get-ting caught. Having to stay quiet will make it even hotter; 
plus, getting it on in a classroom practically sets itself up 
for student/teacher role play.
If you are really desperate to ﬁ  nd a place to get frisky, 
the campus is full of dark and secluded areas at night-
time. Take your pick of any one of them, but take care to 
avoid the wandering eyes of stray campus cats — as well as the occasional passers-by.
As a rule, please clean up after yourselves after your 
foray into public indecency. No one wants to come to 
class only to ﬁ  nd desks covered in lube or other unsavory 
substances.
And as funny as it is to ﬁ  nd condom wrappers all over 
North Lawn, Mother Nature and the janitorial staff will 
thank you if you make sure all prophylactics make it into 
the trash.
Think of having sex on campus as just another thing to 
do for the F Book — I mean, they call it that for a reason, 
don’t they? It might be an unofﬁ  cial tradition, but it’s still 
a tradition nonetheless.

Moving Gator Growl 
won’t solve everything
Florida Blue Key announced Sunday it’s breaking with the 82-year tradition of holding Gator Growl in Ben 
Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium. This October, the pep rally/con-
cert/comedy show will take place on Flavet Field.
Although organizers are spinning the move as a ﬂ  ashy 
new update,  the editorial board feels it’s not enough to 
compensate for deeper issues, including declining atten-
dance and general disinterest.
To be fair, it does seem that organizers are aware some-
thing isn’t working. They’ve spent the past few years adjust-ing Gator Growl’s model — adding comedians, taking away 
musicians, switching up genres, playing with ﬁ  reworks and 
trying to appeal to both student and alumni interests. But 
since 2010, the Swamp has seemed emptier.
In the past, high-proﬁ  le comedians and music acts have 
attracted large crowds. The glory days brought perform-ers like Bob Hope, Bill Cosby, Jerry Seinfeld, Ray Romano, 
Mitch Hedburg, Dane Cook and Dana Carvey. 
In recent years, the Gator Growl acts have fallen in qual-
ity as ticket prices climbed. 
We think the world’s largest student-run pep rally needs 
more than a venue change.
It seems the Gator Growl organizers have fallen victim 
to a universal paradox: They’re attempting to appeal to too-
large a fan base, and in doing so, they’re alienating their au-
dience. 
We understand that Homecoming weekend is catered 
toward UF alumni and supporters who want a dose of nos-
talgia and a chance to connect with the current generation of 
the Gator Nation. But in order for Gator Growl to succeed, it 
needs to be refocused. 
Alumni will come no matter what, so Gator Growl should 
try attracting current students with relevant performers and cheaper tickets. 
If Blue Key and the university don’t change things soon, 
the move to Flavet Field will be the nail in the cofﬁ  n demot-
ing Gator Growl to the ranks of summer concerts. It will be 
just another event, and nobody wants that.
Gator Growl should be a celebration for UF students, 
alumni, supporters, athletes and administration. It deserves better. It deserves the Swamp. It deserves current music acts 
such as the Black Keys, Tom Petty or Vampire Weekend, for 
example. It deserves current comedy acts such as Hannibal 
Buress, John Mulaney or Natasha Leggero. 
Not all hope is lost. We love Gator Growl, and we want to 
see it continue its legacy as the biggest, greatest student-run 
pep rally in the country. 
We realize it’s difﬁ  cult defending the tradition year after 
year, and we appreciate the organizers’ adventurousness in their efforts to switch things up. 
We hope they’ll continue to experiment and evaluate 
Gator Growl’s direction — not just its location.

Last week, the National Labor Relations Board ruled in fa-
vor of a group of Northwestern University football play-ers who are attempting to unionize. It was a major victory 
for student athletes in their ﬁ  ght against the money juggernaut that is the NCAA. The ruling sets up a potential big ﬁ  ght be-tween student athletes and the NCAA regarding the debate on whether college athletes deserve payment for their services that could wind up in the Supreme Court. 
Sports fans are divided over wheth-
er college athletes should get paid; they shouldn’t, and here’s why. 
Despite enormous revenues via 
football and men’s basketball for the NCAA and a select group of univer-sities — including UF — most college sports are not particularly proﬁ  table, and in fact, many operate at a loss. Ac-cording to a recent study, just 22 schools proﬁ  ted from football during the 2009-2010 academic year. College football is hardly the cash cow that some believe the sport to be.
The general consensus seems to be that football players gen-
erate enormous revenues, but in the end, it’s only a few select schools that beneﬁ  t. Many schools spend an upward of $90,000 a year on some athletes.
If college football and basketball players obtain the right to 
be paid, what do we do about the thousands of athletes — who also work incredibly hard on the ﬁ  eld and in the classroom — who participate in athletics that don’t rack up massive proﬁ  ts? 
Do they get paid, too?It’s unfair and wrong to pay football and men’s basketball 
players because they participate in a sport that generates mil-lions of dollars in revenue, but not pay the thousands upon thousands of student athletes competing for their schools in other sports. Additionally, what sum of money is appropriate for the players? Is it right for a star football player to receive a sizable salary because football makes buckets of money while a women’s lacrosse player with a 3.9 GPA gets minimum wage?
Not in the least.For the privilege of being a student athlete, students get full 
scholarships to some of the country’s best public and private universities and are able to achieve a level of education they otherwise may not be able to attain without the scholarship.
Is it wrong that the NCAA, conferences and schools proﬁ  t 
on the backs of these athletes? Perhaps it is, but the scholarships and opportunities presented to the students cannot be discount-ed. 
Instead of giving college athletes a salary, we need to do a 
better job of encouraging them to ﬁ  nish their degrees and utilize the educational opportunities in front of them. 
This seems fairly naïve until you consider the story of former 
Gators football player Matt Elam. Despite earning a seven-ﬁ  g-ure salary in the NFL, Elam returned to Gainesville during the offseason to continue his degree. He even took a low-paying job at a sporting goods store to get a better grasp on the business he wants to pursue following his NFL career.
Why?Elam seems to understand that his football career could be 
very short, and to succeed in the business world, he needs a college education. 
If you need another great example at UF, take a look at our 
men’s basketball team. Four seniors — a rarity in today’s day — start for the team, and senior center Patric Young is a two-time Academic All-American. For those players, success both 
on the court and in the classroom is of the utmost importance. 
Will they get paid one day? I’m sure many of them will, but 
right now, they understand that they’re student athletes  — not professionals. 
Athletic careers make up what amounts to a small portion of 
the lives of players. If we aim to produce more Matt Elams, UF 
basketball players and thousands of other student athletes need 
to stay in school and receive their degrees so they’ll have the tools to succeed both on and off the ﬁ  eld.  
Money is only temporary, but an education is for a lifetime.

opinions@alligator.orgMinimum wage is often associated 
with high school teenagers who are working part time. However, 
the Economic Policy Institute did research to disprove these theories. The ﬁ  ndings 
were astounding: “88 percent of workers who would 
be affected by raising the minimum wage are at least 20 years old, and a third of them are at least 40 years old.”
Is it possible for a person working fulltime — 
possibly with a family — to support themselves on minimum wage? After working 40 hours a week at minimum wage, I feel qualiﬁ  ed to say that it is nearly impossible.
Minimum wage is $7.25. There are proposals to 
raise the minimum wage to $10.10 by 2015. Those working 40 hours a week at our current minimum wage make a little more than $1,000 a month. With the proposed increase, monthly income goes up to $1,600. That $600 can be the difference between miss-ing a rent payment and having a little extra for gro-ceries.
Although minimum wage affects everyone, wom-
en and minorities are especially impacted. Chron.com recently wrote an article on mini-mum wage and looked closely at minori-ties, stating, “Some experts suggest that minimum wages harm the very minority populations they were designed to sup-
port.” 
It’s ironic that minimum wage, which is designed 
to help the U.S. population receive their just pay, is in fact harming the public.
There are plenty of legitimate arguments about 
why a raise in minimum wage would not ﬁ  x any of our current problems. 
The Cato Institute claims that, “As government 
raises the minimum wage, it prices people out of the 
market.” 
This is a very realistic view and is a possible con-
sequence of raising minimum wage. Some think that 
a 40 percent increase in minimum wage would cause more problems. These facts unfortunately put me in a position where I cannot say that raising minimum wage would solve many of our problems. However, I do feel that it is an important conversation to have.

Starbucks plans to add alcoholic drinks such as beer and wine to its menu. The additions will be 
part of Starbucks Evenings, but the changes won’t affect campus locations.
ALEXIA FERNANDEZ
Alligator Contributing Writer
Starbucks is adding beer and 
wine to its menu, but the UF and 
Gainesville locations will not ap-ply the changes.
The menu additions, called 
Starbucks Evenings, were intro-duced in Seattle in 2010.
It’s been incorporated into lo-
cations across the country for a trial run. 
They expect to have 40 loca-
tions by the end of the year and more over the next several years, wrote Starbucks spokeswoman 
Alisha Damodaran in an email.
But the changes won’t take ef-
fect locally.
Marketing Program Manager 
for Gator Dining Services Jill Ro-
driguez wrote in an email that the company has no intention of “adding this component to the 
Starbucks program.”
If the change ever were to hap-pn, it could lead to increased com-
petition for local coffee shops.
Matthew Wrighton, owner 
and manager of Maude’s Classic Cafe in downtown Gainesville, 
said Starbucks is adding alcohol 
to the menu to encroach on small-er businesses.
“When Starbucks originally 
moved next to us in 2000, they said it would support local busi-nesses. They wanted to make it a downtown coffee-shop culture,” he said. “Whatever the local take 
on their new menu is, they’re do-
ing it to increase their sales.”
In four-to-eight weeks, 
Maude’s will add on a tap room with a wider selection of wines and beers than it currently stocks, Wrighton said. 
“There is a desire in coffee-
shop culture to have beer and wine,” he said. 
Wrighton said he won’t be 
worried about the competition 
unless a Starbucks Evenings 
location comes to downtown Gainesville.
Students such as Antony Darce, 
a 23-year-old UF architecture and French senior, reacted negatively 
to the company’s menu addition.
“I’m not really sold on the idea 
of alcohol at Starbucks,” he said. 
“They’ve advertised themselves more as a coffee shop, and even then they were receiving criticism for not being true to that.”
UF biology junior Dianmarie 
De Jesus said she felt similarly.
“It’s not their market,” the 
20-year-old said. “You think of Starbucks, and you think of col-lege kids. It’s a different atmo-sphere.”Gainesville, on-campus Starbucks

Edible bugs and racing 
cockroaches are heading to 
UF on Tuesday.
The UF Entomology Club 
will host its annual BugFest open house, inviting stu-dents and families to learn 
more about insects and the 
university’s entomology and nematology program.
The event, which will take 
place from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m. at 
Steinmetz Hall, has a Poké-
mon theme with the slogan “Gotta Collect ‘Em All,” said Kristen Donovan, event coor-
dinator.
New this year will be the 
“insect Iron Chef” station, 
challenging curious taste buds to try a variety of insect recipes, she said. 
But for those who aren’t 
too enthusiastic about savor-ing the flavor of crispy bugs, BugFest will also be serving 
pizza to the first 400 guests — 
bug-free. 
Donovan, a 21-year-old 
UF entomology and nema-
tology junior, said that the 
event is not just about trying new things but also learning about the insects themselves. Attendees can learn more 
about the program and in-sects at exhibits and informa-tion areas, as well as get to 
encounter the bugs firsthand 
with activities and games.
One of the games will be 
a race of Madagascar hissing 
cockroaches on a four-lane 
track.  The roaches are raised at UF, she said. 
There will also be a “mag-
got art” station where mag-
gots are dipped in paint and 
allowed to create a master-piece. 
“They’re artists, believe it 
or not,” Donovan said.
But bugs aren’t the only 
thing visitors can expect at the open house. The arthro-pod petting zoo allows visi-
tors to interact with critters 
such as the emperor scorpion and the giant African milli-pede.
Morgan Weldon, a 19-
year-old UF entomology and nematology junior, will be volunteering at the event.
She said she is excited to 
educate people and clarify any misconceptions they might have about insects.
“It’s important to learn 
about bugs because they are 
virtually everywhere, and 
people interact and are af-fected by them every day and don’t realize it,” she said.BugFest welcomes

PENSACOLA — A once-home-
less Florida college student is now 
realizing his dreams after placing in a piano competition that will allow him to perform at Carnegie Hall.
James Matthews, 24, sometimes 
slept in his instructor’s piano stu-dio for shelter while he was a stu-dent at Florida Southern College. The professor found Matthews a temporary home and helped him enroll at Chipola College, where Matthews could afford to stay in 
a dorm.
After earning his associate de-
gree, Matthews transferred to the 
University of West Florida.
In January, one of his instruc-
tors there suggested he submit a 
video of himself performing Ser-gei Prokofiev’s “Piano Sonata No. 
7” for the 2014 American Protege International Piano and Strings Competition.
The Pensacola News Journal 
reported Matthews was given an 
honorable mention. As a prize, he 
will play the Weill Recital Hall at 
the world-renowned New York 
City concert venue on April 20.
Matthews’ father started teach-
ing him jazz and blues music 
when he was just 3 years old. In 
middle school, he started with a 
professional piano teacher and started accompanying the school choir.
Matthews was homeless for 
nearly a year and a half after high school, but he continued with his piano studies.
“I always had my piano, and 
it’s always been my escape,” he said. “I decided if I never gave up it would get me through life, and it has. I don’t know where I’d be if 
it wasn’t for music.”Fla. student goes from

Rain showers didn’t stop a chili cook-off celebrating 
the beginning of Water Conservation Month at a O’Leno 
State Park this weekend.
Despite the weather, both chili and environment 
lovers gathered at the O’Leno Ole’ Chili Cook-Off and Springs Celebration on Saturday to ring in the month with music, booths and a chili competition.
The cook-off, now in its sixth year, was a fundraiser 
for upgrades to the nature center at the park, located at 410 SE O’Leno Park Road in High Springs, said Ed Bisch, president of Friends of O’Leno. 
Judges awarded points to qualify members to attend 
an international chili championship in Texas, said Candi Arevalo, the “Great Pepper,” or president, of the Sun-shine State Chili Pod.
Stacie Greco, water conservation coordinator at the 
Alachua County Environmental Protection Department, said local government and state agencies decided on April for Water Conservation Month because it is one of the driest months of the year.
Greco said the quickest way to reduce residential wa-
ter consumption is to lower irrigation usage and switch to Florida-friendly landscaping.
“Within the home, you can switch to a low-flow toi-
let or challenge yourself to take a shower in under five minutes,” she said.
Sam Cole, a park services specialist at Ichetuck-
nee Springs State Park, held a yellow rat snake named Sarabi while teaching attendees about the environment and wildlife. He said there are more than 700 springs in Florida, “and they are the first to show signs of water quality damage.”Chili cook-off celebrates conservation

MEMPHIS, Tenn. — All eyes 
were on Scottie Wilbekin as the 
clock ticked.
Nine, eight, seven.“He’s been doing this all season, 
not just the tournament,” Kasey Hill said. “He’s our leader. We go where he goes.”
Six, five, four.
“He made some tougher shots 
than the ones I thought he would 
normally make when he went in there,” coach Billy Donovan said.
Three, two, one.“That guy is tougher than a three-
dollar steak,” Brad Evans of Yahoo! Sports said. 
The buzzer rang, the crowd 
cheered and Wilbekin — the man who can do no wrong — stole the spotlight once again.
With Florida up 35-24 with 36 
seconds left in the first half, Wil-bekin found a wide-open Michael Frazier II at the top of the arc, but Frazier’s shot clanged off the rim. So 
when Dorian Finney-Smith grabbed 
the offensive rebound and gave the 
ball right back to Wilbekin, the se-
nior point guard wasn’t going to let 
anyone else take the final shot.
For the next 25 seconds, the 
6-foot-2 point guard stood on the NCAA logo at halfcourt and simply waited for an opportunity. He eyed down Dayton’s Vee Sanford — the unfortunate player forced to guard Wilbekin — and then he glanced 
back to Donovan for play call.
Sanford to Donovan. Sanford to 
Donovan. Sanford to Donovan.
But when the clock hit eight sec-
onds, it was time to make a move. Wilbekin inched forward to about 
25 feet out from the basket. It was clear to everyone in FedExForum — even Sanford — that he was going to take the shot.“Obviously, like any play, some-
times it works, sometimes it doesn’t,” Donovan said. “I think he liked the matchup, and he said, ‘Coach, can we go flat?’ which is (when) we put four along the baseline and offen-sive rebound. I trust Scottie enough to put him in those situations.”
And why not?Wilbekin has shown time and time again that an expiring clock doesn’t faze him. In Florida’s South-eastern Conference Tournament

When Florida visited LSU in May 
2013, the Tigers greeted the Gators with 
a dominating three-game sweep.
This weekend, UF returned the fa-
vor. 
Florida (19-9, 6-3 Southeastern Con-
ference) beat No. 8 LSU (20-8-1, 3-5-1 
SEC) 11-7 after falling behind Sunday af-
ternoon at McKethan Stadium, complet-ing a three-game sweep — the first UF sweep of LSU since 2011 — and claiming their fifth victory against a top-10 team in 11 days.
“I’m not quite 
sure if three 
weeks ago this 
team would have 
had it in them to fight back,” coach Kev-in O’Sullivan said. “I think we’re in a dif-ferent place right now.”

MEMPHIS, Tenn. — No. 1 seed Florida’s 
defense looked as stout as ever heading into 
halftime against No. 11 seed Dayton on Sat-urday. 
In the six minutes before intermission in 
FedExForum, the Gators limited the Flyers to three points on a 1-of-7 clip from the field. In that same time period, UF scored 17 points on 6-of-10 shooting, with nine coming from se-nior Scottie Wilbekin.
“I think our defensive mindset is the foun-
dation of our team,” center Patric Young said. “We just take so much pride into being able to disrupt the team and being able to lock down guys.”
But in the final 20 min-
utes of the Elite Eight 
matchup, Dayton flipped the key on Florida, post-ing 28 points on 50-percent 
shooting.
Senior forward Dyshawn Pierre was a cat-
alyst for the Flyers in the final minutes.
“I didn’t think that we really guarded Florida defense key in victory

“Gators in the Final Four in Dallas next weekend!??? I’ll be there:)”
Chandler Parsons (@ChandlerParsons)  
Former UF forwardmatchup with Tennessee on March 15, 
the Gainesville native knocked down a buzzer-beating three to help the Gators chip away at the Volunteers’ lead.
One week later in the third round of 
the NCAA Tournament against Pitt, Wil-bekin sunk a nearly identical shot to pad Florida’s lead heading into the break.
But on Saturday, Wilbekin’s 25-footer 
was more than just a three. It was more than just a cushion to the Gators’ lead. 
With the buzzer-beater, the senior re-
minded the country that he and the rest of the Gators aren’t ever satisfied. Florida’s 
four-man senior class has suffered for the 
past three years, but now that they are poised for a national championship run, there is no letting off the gas pedal.
“I mean, Coach D said before the 
game that it feels like you’re destined, like things happen for a reason,” Wilbekin said. “He felt like we were all brought together on this team for a reason. I think 
that couldn’t be more true.”
The four-year point guard, who has 
endured everything from playing off the 
bench to sitting out eight games because of suspensions, will play in his first and last Final Four when Florida travels to Arlington, Texas, to face UConn on Sat-urday at 6:09 p.m. 
So even though Wilbekin has racked 
up a laundry list of awards this season — including most recently the Most Outstanding Player of the South Region honor — he couldn’t care less about the individual recognition.
His team is in the Final Four, and he is 
not taking it for granted.
“I’m happy about the award, but it’s 
nothing compared to winning,” Wil-
bekin said. “I’m just so happy right now 
that we were able to achieve what we did so far with this group of guys.”trailed early in the final contest.
The Tigers jumped out to a 
1-0 lead when catcher Kade Sciv-icque drove in shortstop Alex Bregman, but the Gators tied the game minutes later on a solo home run to left-center field from center fielder Harrison Bader.
Bader’s homer was the fourth 
for the Gators during the week-end — an impressive power surge from a team that had only six home runs entering the se-ries.
“It’s kind of like the law of 
averages,” first baseman Peter Alonso said. “We didn’t really have that many at the beginning 
of the year, but as the season 
progresses, everyone’s starting to get a bit more comfortable at the plate.”
But LSU took the lead back 
quickly, scoring three runs in the next two innings to go ahead 4-2 heading to the bottom of the third. However, patience pre-
vailed for Florida.
Second baseman Casey Tur-
geon walked on four straight 
pitches to lead off the inning and advanced to third on a ground 
out and a stolen base. Catcher 
Taylor Gushue drove him in 
with a single, and Tigers hurler Zac Person walked three straight batters to score the tying run.
Alonso capped off the rally 
with a single to left, giving the Gators a 6-4 lead they never re-linquished.
“I was just sitting fastball be-
cause the kid couldn’t really spin the breaking ball for a strike,” Alonso said. “It’s been a while since I’ve gotten into one like 
that.”
Starting pitcher Justin Sha-
fer, fresh off a 4-inning scoreless 
start against FSU, did not have the same success as the offense. 
O’Sullivan relieved the junior pitcher in the third inning after he gave up four runs on six hits. 
Freshman left-hander 
Kirby Snead replaced Shafer. O’Sullivan had previously used Snead in short stints out of the pen, allowing him to pitch to one 
or two batters — primarily left-
handers — before revisiting the mound.
But Snead had a chance to air 
his arm out Sunday.
Snead tossed 4.2 innings — 
only two outs shy of his entire inning total entering the game — of scoreless relief and picked up 
his first career win.
At one point, Snead retired 
nine straight. He showed his 
command of the plate, throwing 34 of his 47 pitches for strikes.
“That’s Sully’s main thing,” 
Snead said. “When we come out of the pen, just get ahead and get outs quick.”
While Snead was working 
the Tigers at the plate, the Gators were extending their lead in the fifth inning. 
Again, walks proved key 
to Florida’s rally. Right fielder Braden Mattson and Shafer walked to begin the inning and advanced a base on a sacrifice bunt by third baseman John Ster-nagel. 
Alonso drew an intentional 
walk — the Gators’ eighth of 11 free passes during the game — 
and O’Sullivan had catcher Mike 
Fahrman pinch-hit for left fielder Ryan Larson, who was hitless.
Fahrman knocked a single 
down the left-field line, scoring two more Gators. 
“It takes some focus,” Fahrman said of pinch-hitting. “You got to always have an idea of who’s coming in … Always making sure that, hey, this could be the shot, you might get the at-bat here.”
Shortstop Richie Martin 
capped the fifth-inning rally with a two-run double, giving Florida an 11-4 lead.
LSU attempted to stage a 
comeback in the bottom of the ninth, scoring three runs — in-cluding two on the Tigers’ sec-ond home run of the game — but fell short of the difficult task in 
front of them.
“It was kind of like the swag 
that Sully talks about,” Alonso 
said. “It’s more confidence than anything. … I feel like we have that now, and the world’s our oyster.”

Young returns to form after subpar performance in Sweet 16
Pierre very well today in and 
around the basket,” coach Billy Donovan said. “I thought he really, really hurt [Will] Yeguete, and we hurt [Casey] Prather a lot. … There were some pick-and-roll coverages that I did not think were very good, were blown today. We need to get better there.”
Florida’s saving grace in its 62-
52 win against Dayton came in the battle of the boards. UF out-rebounded UD 19-11 in the final half while also winning the offen-sive rebound battle 8-0 in the final 20 minutes.
“I thought the game was won by 
the offensive rebounds,” Donovan said. “I thought we had a couple of good looks.”
Young rebounds in Elite Eight:  
In UF’s 79-68 win against No. 4 seed UCLA on Thursday, Patric Young was a non-factor.
The senior center scored only four points and grabbed three re-bounds while racking up four per-sonal fouls in 20 minutes of play.
“It was frustrating because I do 
as much as I can to try to prepare to put myself in a position to have a good game,” Young said Friday at Florida’s Elite Eight media day. “I’ve just got to flush it, learn from it, move forward.”
But Young rebounded in UF’s 
62-52 Elite Eight victory against No. 11 seed Dayton, logging 12 points, six defensive rebounds, four blocks and two steals in 31 minutes.
“Whatever advantage we saw 
we had, [we] just keep sticking to that. Early, that was me inside,” Young said.
“Late, us rebounding on the 
glass helped us to solidify our win tonight. I was just glad that I could have an impact, especially down low.”
The Flyers knew they were going 
to have to make adjustments to their gameplay against the 6-foot-9 center.  “Once he drove, you had to think pass because you’ve got Patric Young with his big old body there, and you had to just pass the ball,” Dayton senior forward Dyshawn Pierre said. “He altered shots very well, a lot of their players.”
Notes: The Gators committed 
only 10 personal fouls against the Flyers on Saturday, its second-lowest total of the season (7, Pitts-burgh). 
No UF player committed more 
than two fouls in the contest. … Florida’s 14-point lead heading into halftime was its largest margin since being up by 21 in the regular season finale against Kentucky on March 8. It was UF’s largest lead after 20 minutes in a game away from the O’Connell Center since being ahead by 19 against Jackson-ville on Nov. 25. … Senior point guard Scottie Wilbekin recorded double-digit point totals in eight straight games, dating back to the Gators’ March 8 matchup with the Wildcats. Since the start of the SEC tournament, the senior point guard has logged 107 points, 21 assists, 16 steals and just 7 turnovers.

Junior Camilla Hedberg’s second con-
secutive top-five placing while braving 
both sleet and wind led the Gators to a 
ninth-place finish Sunday. 
No. 18 Florida finished the three-round 
Bryan National Collegiate tournament in 
the middle of the leaderboard with a score 
of 915 (+51).
“The conditions today were some of the 
toughest I’ve ever seen in my career, both 
as a player and as a coach,” coach Emily Glaser said in a release.
Hedberg, the only Gator who had 
played the Bryan Park Champions Course  in Greensboro, N.C., previously, had a shaky start, recording two bogeys and 
a double bogey during the first round of 
play. 
However, after consistently shooting 
one-over, one-under, and par during the second and third rounds, Hedberg shot up 
the leaderboard on Sunday and finished 
tied for third with three other players. 
Her score of 220 (+4) put her at least 11 
shots and 30 places ahead of the rest of the 
team.
“Camilla’s round was outstanding, and 
she was very patient and smart — the two 
main factors you needed to play well [Sun-day],” Glaser said. “The rest of our team struggled immensely and it was disap-
pointing that no one stepped up to fight 
through the elements.”
Junior Sarah Schober tied with eight 
other players with a score of 231 (+15). De-spite having two double bogeys and seven 
bogeys in the third round alone, Schober’s 
score was the second highest from Flori-da’s lineup.
Freshman Maria Torres and redshirt 
sophomore Katie Mitchell started out the tournament strong, finishing Round 1 fewer than five strokes over par, but increasingly 
struggled as the tournament progressed.  
Mitchell failed to score a single birdie in the third round while Torres’s two birdies in the two rounds were canceled out by 10 bogeys and two double bogeys.
Freshman Karolina Vlckova rounded out the team’s standings tied for 73rd after shooting only two birdies during the entire 
tournament.
“The key was to not beat yourself up by 
making big numbers,” Glaser said. “And that is what we did.”
The Gators’ first tournament of the 
postseason will be the Southeastern Con-
ference Championships in Birmingham, Ala., on April 18.EDEN OTERO

For three years, Nora Barry 
has played the supporting role of 
the unsung hero.
She makes stops when they’re 
needed most. She scores when 
momentum isn’t there. She can 
even stand in front of an anxious defense and hold the ball until 
there are only 20 seconds left on the clock before scoring the win-ning point of the game.
Nora Barry is Florida’s go-to 
player.
In No. 4 Florida’s 13-9 win 
over No. 11 Penn State (7-4, 2-1 American Lacrosse Conference), 
Barry did what needed to be 
done.
While Barry’s numbers 
weren’t any better than usual, it was her presence on the field that 
changed the game.
Barry is known for her as-
sists on goals and ability to pull 
defenders off of other players so 
they can get open to make a shot. 
She did just that against the Nit-tany Lions on Sunday.
“I don’t think you can actu-
ally define what she means to our 
program, just in terms of doing 
the dirty work,” coach Amanda O’Leary said. “(She’s) getting the ground balls, getting the draw controls and creating opportuni-ties offensively for not only her-
self but also her teammates. … 
She’s a critical piece to our puzzle here.”
Barry had only one assist for 
the day. It came on a goal late in the 
first half by freshman teammate Mollie Stevens — who scored a career-high four points — but Barry’s presence was noted on 
the field throughout the game.
As Penn State became more 
aggressive, so did Barry. She was 
one of four Florida players  who received a yellow card and was 
forced to sit out while Penn State 
played with a man-up advan-tage.
“It’s really about getting the 
draw, getting the caused turn-overs on defense,” Barry said. 
“If I can do that for my team, 
then I’m happy to get the ball up the field and I know that our at-
tackers can put it away.”
Barry had three draw controls 
and one assist against Penn State, 
but her defining moment for the 
2014 season so far was against 
Loyola on March 4 when she took the final shot of the game to put Florida up 14-13.As Florida moves into its final 
games of the season, Barry’s skills on the draw and on ground balls will be essential in Florida’s bid for the ALC championship at the 
conference’s tournament in May.
Florida faces No. 9 Johns Hop-
kins on Saturday. 
The two schools have played 
each other every season since Florida’s lacrosse program start-
ed competition in 2010. Florida is 3-1 in the series against Johns Hopkins. 
While the Gators haven’t 
checked film for Saturday’s game yet, O’Leary said Barry is key in the offenses ability to continue winning the draw control and 
ground balls.
O’Leary was disappointed 
with the slow second half that 
nearly cost Florida a victory, but 
Barry and junior Shannon Gil-
roy’s tough mentality and work on changing the spread of the of-fense saved Florida from a poten-tial loss. 
O’Leary is now looking to 
work with the team on adapting to other teams during the game before heading to Johns Hop-
kins. 
“We needed to adjust and I 
think it took us too long to adjust 
to what they were doing offen-sively and what they were doing 
defensively,” O’Leary said. 
“We need to be able to recog-
nize that and make changes on 
the field. I don’t think we had a 
very good second half to be quite 
honest.”14, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, MARCH 31, 2014

With four matches left in the sea-
son and the Southeastern Confer-
ence Tournament drawing closer, 
the Gators will soon try to capture their third national title in four 
years.
No. 4 Florida (15-4, 7-2 SEC) 
moved one step closer to the post-
season when it defeated No. 49 LSU (9-10, 2-8 SEC) 4-0 on Sunday.
But coach Roland Thornqvist is 
hardly thinking past this week.
“Oh, good heavens,” Thornqvist 
said. “Yeah, we’ve got two more 
weekends, so the SEC Tournament 
is [close]. But we’re still in the hunt for the regular season.”
It was hard to find fault with 
anything the Gators did yesterday, as each player won in straight sets after UF grabbed the doubles point. 
Olivia Janowicz and Kourtney 
Keegan won 8-2 in the first match as 
they continued their dominance in doubles. The duo played at the No. 
1 position for the first time this year and improved to 11-2 on the season.
“Well they’re playing at the high-
est level now, and you could see that 
today,” Thornqvist said of the Jano-
wicz-Keegan tandem. “They have a tremendous amount of confidence and they can play three-strike tennis in doubles.”
The No. 20 doubles team of Sofie 
Oyen and Belinda Woolcock cap-tured the doubles point with an 8-4 victory. The duo lost its last three 
doubles matches but believed today 
was a sign of improvement.  
“[Belinda and I] had some tough 
matches the past few matches, some tough losses and close ones,” Oyen said. “But overall, we have great chemistry.”
The Gators rode their momen-
tum through singles action en route 
to the team’s second straight sweep.
Brianna Morgan was leading 4-3 
on Court 1 when LSU’s Joana Vale 
Costa retired with a knee injury, giv-ing the Gators a 2-0 lead. Soon after, Janowicz won 6-2, 6-1, and Cercone earned her 20th singles win with a 6-2, 6-1 match-clinching victory.
“I feel that I played pretty well,” 
Cercone said. “In doubles, I started out a little slow. Once we figured out what we needed to do and we got some momentum, it was much better. 
“In singles I had a few things in 
my mind that I wanted to work on, and I think I did those things fairly well.”
Cercone, like her coach, is intent 
on focusing on the season’s remain-ing matches. But she still wants to improve before she begins her final postseason as a Gator.
“Every day we’re looking to get 
better. That’s our goal,” the senior said. “I think that being more dis-ciplined on key points is something that we can all do a lot better job at and that can lead to more efficient matches. It makes it easier on our bodies, which is going to be impor-tant come post-season.”
Florida will travel to face Mis-
sissippi State on Friday as the SEC Tournament looms in the back-ground.
But you wouldn’t know it from 
talking to Thornqvist.
“The tournament is too far away 
to worry about that,” he said.MONDAY, MARCH 31, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15

After losing to Arkansas in 
Fayetteville, Ark., on Friday, 
Florida (10-7, 5-3 Southeastern 
Conference) didn’t waste any 
time getting back on track in its 4-0 victory over LSU (11-10, 2-7 SEC) in Baton Rouge, La., 
on Sunday. 
Bryan Shelton and his team 
had a hard time against the Ti-
gers last season, dropping the match 4-2. Entering Sunday’s 
contest, LSU led the all-time 
series with UF 27-24-1. The team didn’t expect any breaks against LSU. Its gameplan was 
to hit the ground running and 
have no mercy.
“We don’t take anyone 
lightly,” assistant coach Mark Merklein said in a release 
Thursday. “It’s nice to go into 
the LSU match and know that this team beat us last year. Now we have to prove some-
thing.”
Florida has played better 
when it wins the doubles point, 
which it did Sunday evening.
First to finish on the doubles 
court were Maxx Lipman and Elliot Orkin in a fairly easy 8-2 decision over LSU’s Andrew 
Korinek and Boris Arias. 
Second to finish for the 
Gators were Diego Hidalgo 
and Michael Alford. 
They struggled to find their 
stroke in the match and fell 3-8 to Chris Simpson and Justin Butsch. 
With the matches tied at one 
for the doubles point, it was up to Gordon Watson and Florent 
Diep to win the clinching point 
for their team. Despite this be-ing the first time that the two players paired up, they won in 
an 8-3 match against the 70th-
ranked duo Tam Trinh and Eric Perez. 
On the singles court, Flori-
da gave up no points, winning in three straight matches. First 
to finish was freshman Orkin 
in straight sets, 6-1, 6-2, against Trinh, giving the Gators a 2-0 lead. 
Next to win was 108th-
ranked Diep, who also won in straight sets, 6-4, 6-3, over Jus-tin Butsch. 
Diep’s win gave the Gators 
a commanding 3-0 lead over the Tigers. 
Lipman closed out the 
match for Florida. Despite a tough first set, he managed to 
regain focus and defeat Arias, 
7-5, 6-2. 
“I’m very proud of of how 
our guys dealt with the dis-

There just wasn’t enough left in the 
tank for the Gators to make a push down 
the stretch at the NCAA Men’s Swimming 
and Diving Championships, which ended 
Saturday.
Florida was in third after Day 1 and 
only trailed by nine points with some of 
its best events to come. 
Despite making the podium five times 
over the next two days, the Gators couldn’t 
improve and ended nationals with a bronze medal and a little disappointment.
“It’s always a little bittersweet, you fall 
short of some of your goals,” coach Gregg Troy said in a release. “But undefeated season, I can’t tell you how many school records we broke, tremendous four years for some seniors that were All-Americans 
year in and year out and third place at the 
NCAA meet — well that’s a little shy of what we thought we could do.”
Florida broke seven 
school records, and senior 
Marcin Cieslak led the way with two gold med-als in the 200-yard indi-vidual medley (1:40.58) and a school record in 
the 100-yard butterfly 
(44.87 seconds) — the only individual titles for 
the Gators — in what was the best finish 
for the program in nearly a quarter of a 
century.
“Ah, 23 years, it’s the best we could do this year,” Troy said. 
“It’s just a tremendous group of guys. 
I told a couple of them tonight that are se-niors that I’d go to war with those guys any time.”
Cieslak came into NCAAs with four 
second-place finishes in three years. Af-
ter breaking out with two gold medals 
through the first two days, he was within 0.86 seconds of sweeping his events after a silver-medal swim in the 200-yard fly finals on Saturday touching in at 1:40.19 
seconds and earning him the high-point 
award for the meet.
Junior Dan Wallace made an impact for 
Florida as well. He won two silver med-
als in the 500-yard free (4:11.62) and 400-
yard IM (3:38.18) and picked up some of the slack left by redshirt senior Sebastien Rousseau.
Rousseau was seeded sixth in the 200-
yard IM but finished more than two sec-onds behind his seed time in 21st, ended up four spots behind his seeding in ninth for the 400-yard IM and made his only final of the meet in the 200-yard fly, in 
which he placed eighth despite being the 
No. 2 seed.
It might not have been just a poor per-
formance from Rousseau. 
Troy alluded to some illness affecting 
the two-time South African Olympian as well as other swimmers in a post-meet in-terview. 
“A little unfortunate,” Troy said. “We 
had to deal with a little bit of illness here this semester that hurt us a little bit perfor-mance-wise.”Florida men have best showing at NCAA Championships in 23 years

“We don’t take 
anyone lightly. It’s nice 
to go into the LSU match 
and know that this 
team beat us last year. 
Now we have to prove 
something.”

UF assistant coach points during the span and cap-
ping it off with an improvisa-tional buzzer-beating three. With 15,443 fans watching  — the ma-jority supporting Dayton — he 
wasted the ﬁ  nal 33 seconds of 
the clock, pulled up for a three at the top of the key and drained it over Dayton’s Vee Sanford as the buzzer sounded.
After sinking the shot, the 
senior point guard jogged to the locker room with his arms held high. 
“When he shot it, I just knew it 
was going in,” Prather said. “Ev-erybody has conﬁ  dence in him, and he has conﬁ  dence to take those shots.”
Florida led by as many as 17 
points about midway through the second half, but Dayton soon made a charge. Behind seven 
straight points from forward Dy-
shawn Pierre, the Flyers cut their deﬁ  cit to 58-50 with 3:55 left.
“I give them all the credit,” 
said Wilbekin, who was named the Most Outstanding Player of the South Regional. “They fought through the whole 40 minutes, but we did the same.”
During UD’s run, the Gators 
appeared worn down to Dono-van. Then, their rebounding prowess and free-throw shooting ultimately made the difference.
The Gators outrebounded the 
Flyers 7-0 on the offensive glass in the game’s ﬁ  nal 6:08 and went 4 of 7 at the line to seal the win.
“The game was won by our offensive rebounding, by our free-throw shooting,” Donovan 
said. “That was really, I think, the 
story of the game.”
Florida held a high-octane 
Dayton team to 39.6 percent shooting and its lowest-scoring contest this year. The Gators shot only 37.5 percent from the ﬂ  oor but made 21 of 28 free throws compared to Dayton’s 8-of-18 
clip from the charity stripe. 
Wilbekin’s 23 points on 6-of-
14 shooting tie a career high. 
Young chipped in 12 points and six boards, while Frazier added 10 points on 4-of-8 shooting.
Next up for the Gators are the 
Huskies — the last group to hand Donovan’s squad a loss. 
Since UConn guard Shabazz 
Napier sunk UF’s hopes on a buzzer-beater to win 65-64 in Storrs, Conn., on Dec. 2, Florida has won 30 straight games.
No. 2 seed Wisconsin, the only 
other team to hand UF a loss this season, and No. 8 seed Kentucky, which UF beat three times this 
year, are set to join No. 1 seed 
Florida and No. 7 seed UConn in Arlington. 
The Gators will travel to Cow-
boys Stadium joyful after over-coming a daunting obstacle but still hungry to avenge a loss to UConn and achieve their ﬁ  nal goal. 
 “I don’t think any team wants 
to go to the Final Four and be like, “All right, we made it. That’s it,’” Young said.
“We’re going to go … into the 
game fearless.”16, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, MARCH 31, 2014
