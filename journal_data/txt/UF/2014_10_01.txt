Like the ﬁ  rst day of qualifying and 
slating for the Student Senate, the UF 
Student Government Fall 2014 elections are off to a slow start.
A total of 4,681 votes were cast Tuesday, according to UF Supervisor of Elections Hans Rojas, which is 1,443 ballots fewer than last Fall’s elections. Fall 2013’s ﬁ  rst day saw 6,124 ballots, a turnout that trumped Spring 2014’s ﬁ  rst day tally of 5,457 ballots.
While no technical glitches were 
reported, Rojas said he ﬁ  led two com-plaints with the Elections Commission against Swamp Party and Evan Mor-ris, one of two Independent candidates, because they failed to submit ﬁ  nancial 
statements before the deadline.
Elections commission chairman Har-
old Holder was unable to be reached for 
comment.

A naked woman was in the semitruck that 
plowed into a school bus Monday as it prepared 
to unload students on U.S. Highway 301, about 35 
minutes north of Gainesville. 
The semitruck — driven by Shannon Sherrell 
Ford of Interlachen, Florida — did not stop, push-
ing the school bus off the roadway north of Starke, 
Florida, and through a ditch running along the 
highway’s south shoulder.
The school bus — driven by Jennifer Lynn 
Swanson, 37, of Starke — continued to move south before stopping along the right shoulder.
Following the impact, the semitruck continued 
south and jack-knifed before stopping in a ditch.
Ford, 35, and his passenger, Sherry Ford, 34, 
were seriously injured and transported to UF 
Health Shands Hospital in Gainesville for treat-
ment. Sherry Ford was partially nude, but it’s not clear whether she was in the cabin or in the sleeper at the time of the accident, according to The Associ-ate Press.
Swanson and three of the children on the bus 
were transported to Shands Starke Regional Medi-cal Center with minor injuries. Another three were taken to Shands and one to Wolfson Children’s 
Hospital in Jacksonville for treatment.
After the crash, the bus sat in a ﬁ  eld of over-
grown grass on the side of the highway, the back 
left corner partially peeled off.
The semitruck was in pieces as ofﬁ  cers in bright 
yellow vests patrolled the scene.Nude passenger

California’s new sexual consent law is giving college cam-
puses extra legal backing to the phrase “No means no.”
The consent law is the ﬁ  rst of its kind, but UF media law 
professor Clay Calvert said it remains to be seen whether the 
legislation will gain enough traction to be implemented in 
states like Florida or nationwide.The law, passed Sunday, requires students to give expres-
sive consent before and during sexual activity, including either 
a verbal “yes” or a nonverbal sign before engaging with part-ners. Not resisting does not equal consent.
“It certainly is well-meaning legislation designed to prevent 
sexual assault,” Calvert said. “But enforceability is also going 
to be an issue.”
The law also states students must give “ongoing” afﬁ  rma-
tive consent throughout any sexual activity, but it is unclear 
how often or how many times students will be expected to re-California passes new consent law, UF community weighs in

BEIT LAHIYA, Gaza Strip — A 
trio of scrawny lions was brought 
into Israel from Gaza on Tuesday 
en route to a better life at a wildlife 
sanctuary in Jordan after their zoo was damaged in the recent Israel-Hamas war.
The three lions, a pair of males 
and a pregnant female, were sedated at Al Bisan zoo in Beit Lahia before the big cats were 
placed in metal cages and loaded 
onto a truck that 
transferred them through the Erez border crossing into Israel.
Amir Khalil of 
the Four Paws International welfare group said the zoo’s animals were in urgent need of care after the 50-day war. He said the zoo was badly damaged, and more than 80 animals 
died as a result of the fighting.
Most of the zoo animals in Gaza 
have been hauled into the isolated 
territory through smuggling tunnels 
linking the territory to Egypt. In one 
famous scene captured on film, Ga-zans used a crane to lift a camel over the border fence by one of its legs as the animal writhed in agony.
Last year, a pair of newborn lion 
cubs died shortly after they were proudly unveiled by Gaza’s Hamas rulers.War damages Gaza zoo, displaces lionsALEXIA FERNANDEZ

University Police will soon 
pay students to keep a protec-
tive eye on their peers for the 
Walk Safe Student Escort Pro-
gram.
UPD spokesman Maj. Brad 
Barber said the department is 
looking to hire part-time po-
sitions. 
“Students who wish to 
participate as employees and members of the Walk Safe 
program are invited to fill 
out an application,” he said. “Background investigations will be conducted on those 
selected.” 
The program will function 
seven days a week between 
the hours of 7 p.m. to 3 a.m. Student employees, male and 
female, will be paid $8.50 an 
hour. 
The Walk Safe program 
has changed from a volunteer 
program to a paid employ-
ment position because of the need for further safety on campus, Barber said.
He said part-time employ-
ees will be hired until the walks are sufficiently staffed to fill the program’s require-ments.
“This is part of a transi-
tion,” he said. “It was de-cided that (the program) was 
a permanent solution to this 
recognized need.” 
Tyler Turner, a UF busi-
ness management freshman, 
said he’s volunteered for the 
program as a way to get in-volved in school activities. 
“It was already doing very 
well as a volunteer program,” 
Turner, 18, said. “By paying 
students, they’re going to get even more people willing to step in.” 
Turner has had friends use 
the program at night but said most people are reluctant to use it. 
“I think students believe 
that they’re burdening peo-ple if they ask to be walked somewhere,” he said. “But we tell them every time that 
that is what we’re here for.”
Turner said he is looking 
to apply for a position with 
the program as long as it does not conflict with his classes.
Students can pick up an 
application for the program from the UPD Community Services Division between 
Monday and Friday. UPD offers part-time

UF ASSAULTSturnout in the second day of voting.
“I’m kind of nervous to hear the 
results, but I’m more hopeful that 
students will go out and vote,” the 20-year-old UF marketing junior 
said.
Swamp Party spokeswoman Ka-
tie Backstrand said the party will 
continue to campaign and urge stu-dents to vote today.
“We have been out there every 
day and will be out there all day to-day and tomorrow in order to edu-cate the student body about Student 
Government elections as much as 
possible and get their feedback,” she wrote in an email.
Preston Jones, 18, an indepen-
dent candidate running to represent Hume Hall in the Senate, has spent the last two days campaigning out-side of Hume. The UF civil engineer-ing freshman said he thinks voter 
turnout will be higher for Hume 
because of the competition between himself and Swamp Party candidate Rachael Laky for the residence hall’s sole Senate seat.
Bridget Chalifour, 19, voted for 
Jones at the Reitz Union Computer Lab because she appreciated his de-votion to Hume and his platform.“I read his platform, and I agree 
with everything that he stands for,” 
the UF environmental science soph-
omore said.
Since he personally knew two 
candidates, Manny Fernandez, a 22-year-old fifth-year UF linguistics senior, cast his ballot at the Norman Hall library for all nine of District A’s Swamp Party candidates.
“Where I live, there is only 
Swamp Party, so I voted for them,” Fernandez said. “The two people I knew personally, so I trust them in 
Student Government.”
Today is the last day to vote, and 
the 12 polling stations will be open 
from 8:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. Unlike past elections, election results will be posted online rather than announced to a crowd, and paper copies of the results will be available at the Reitz Union’s third floor lobby by 10 p.m. 
today, Rojas said.
assure their partners.
“I think that what that 
means, how often that is, and 
whether in reality people are going to do that when they get 
caught up in the heat of the 
moment is still to be seen,” he said.
Ultimately, Calvert said, the 
law aims to push the state’s uni-versities to take action against sexual assault. In order to re-ceive state funds for financial assistance, public institutions 
need to prove they are enforc-
ing these rules somehow.
The law will also require 
universities to offer on-campus victims’ advocates, The New York Times reported. Victims who report sexual assault will not be penalized if underage 
drinking is a factor, and infor-
mation on sexual assault and consent will be presented dur-ing each freshman orientation.
“It’s to get universities to be 
more proactive on how they re-port crimes and also educating their students,” he said.
The law will change the con-
versation about rape culture, said Diamond Delaney, presi-dent of  UF’s Women’s Student 
Association.
“The bill shifts the blame 
from the victim by mandating 
that someone has to get definite signals from sexual partners before they engage in any activ-ity,” the public relations junior said.
Despite questions of how to 
enforce the law, Delaney, 19,  said she believes it will build additional protections for sexu-al assault victims.
“I do appreciate all of the re-
sources that the bill brings in an attempt to educate the masses about consent, as well as pro-vide support for the victims,” 
she said. “And I wish that we 
say more of that in Florida.”A “yes” is required

MIAMI — The manager of a restaurant 
where 15 people were shot during a teen party 
over the weekend was arrested for selling li-quor without a license, authorities said Tues-day.
Police and city investigators inspected The 
Spot on Monday and found three bottles of liquor behind the bar. The restaurant, which is popular for its fried conch, chicken wings and island music, is only licensed to sell food, beer and wine, according to the Department of Business and Professional Regulation.
Police said The Spot should not have been 
functioning as a nightclub early Sunday morn-ing when a shooting sent terrified patrons 
running from the club and wounded many 
youngsters, including an 11-year-old girl. Neighbors said the adult club had recently started hosting a teen night with popular DJs that was drawing large crowds.
A message left for manager Tiffany John-
son was not immediately returned Tuesday.
Miami Fire Rescue Capt. Ignatius Carroll 
said they’re waiting to hear from the fire mar-shal about whether the venue was over capac-ity. Surveillance video from a furniture store next door showed dozens of teens streaming out of the small restaurant when the shooting 
began around 1 a.m. Sunday.
Neighbors said the recent teen nights had 
become very popular and that large groups 
like to shuttle between the restaurant and the convenience store across the street.
Mike Brown, who lives a few houses down 
from the restaurant, said he saw teens hitting the ground, jumping the fence and running toward him as gunshots were being fired. It’s not clear what prompted the shooting. Police have released few details and have not identi-fied any suspects.
Most of the wounded had been treated and 
released, but four people remained hospital-ized Tuesday. One was in critical condition, Jackson Health System spokeswoman Jennifer Piedra said.
Fire Rescue officials found minor viola-
tions during their inspection of the restaurant Monday, including a non-compliant extension cord, a broken door latch and an oven hood that needed maintenance, Carroll said.4, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 1, 2014

Students who commute 
to campus from outside 
Alachua County will face a 
blank ballot during the Fall 
2014 Student Government elections. 
No candidate — either 
from the Swamp Party or those running as an Inde-pendent — has stepped up to campaign as a senator for District E, which represents 
students living outside of 
Alachua County. The bal-lot has a write-in candidate form.
It is uncertain what will happen to District E if there is no candidate write-in, said Hans Rojas, UF Supervisor of Elections.  A replacement 
senator may be appointed 
later in the year by the Stu-dent Senate Replacement and Agenda committee 
through standard proce-
dures, he said.
Rojas said he did not 
know the exact number of students living in District E.
Swamp Party spokes-
woman Katie Backstrand wrote in an email there were no candidates that the 
Swamp Party could slate for 
District E. She added that the Swamp Party is not pursuing a write-in campaign either.
Jacqueline Sweat, 20, 
commutes daily to UF from Middleburg, Florida. Sweat votes for District E candi-
dates every semester, but 
she feels that her district is underrepresented.
Because she can’t find ad-
equate parking on campus, 
Sweat said she has to add 
another 30 minutes to her 45-minute drive to park near Southwest Recreation Cen-
ter and take a bus to get to 
her classes.
 “It does bother me in the 
sense because commuters have our own issues with 
parking,” said the UF tour-
ism, recreation and sport management senior.No District E candidate up for

The 100-acre expansion of Butler 
Plaza hasn’t come without skepti-
cism from residents who worry that the construction will affect wildlife.
The expansion will cover the for-
mer Windmeadows Mobile Home Park, an area that has been aban-doned since 2002.  In more than a 
decade, it became overgrown with 
trees and small animals — animals that could be displaced by the new development, residents have ar-gued.
Ken Weyrauch, a UF urban & 
regional planning graduate student, 
said the concern came to his atten-
tion last week.
Weyrauch, who lives in the 
Windmeadows apartment complex behind the Butler Plaza expansion site, said the clearing happening 
outside his window wasn’t a prob-
lem until he saw a baby squirrel looking for shelter.
“One night, I heard a squeaking 
scream outside my door, and I went out, and there was this baby squir-rel,” Weyrauch, 33, said. 
Representatives at the county En-
vironmental Protection Department 
could not be reached for comment.
Like Weyrauch, other residents 
have expressed concern that the 
clearing could prove detrimental to the area’s 12-year inhabitants. But Gerry Dedenbach, vice president of Causseaux, Hewett, & Walpole Inc., the development company handling the project, said the expansion won’t 
affect the area’s wildlife.
In fact, it is part of the expansion 
plans, Dedenbach said.
“We are selectively preserving several trees,” he said.  “And there are dozens of trees that will be incor-
porated into a new plan.”
The area was previously farm-
land, which later became Stengel Airport in the 1940s. About 30 years later, Clark Butler purchased the airport to build the previous mobile home park, he said.
“Through the course of those ap-
provals, there weren’t any wildlife or significant environmental con-cerns because it was farmland, then airport, then a mobile home park,” he said.
The area never became fully 
wooded — simply overgrown, he said. Squirrels and birds can con-tinue to live in the new area.
“As the site is redeveloped and 
revegetated, it will remain popu-lated by urban mammals and urban avian species.”WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 1, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 5

To dispel anxiety over assault 
rumors seen on social media, UF 
faculty and Gainesville Police urge students to look to official sources for information.
Yik Yak, a popular anonymous 
posting app that launched in No-vember 2013, has been a platform for rumors and threats to public safety on campuses around the na-tion.
Some threats have led to closed 
buildings, campus alerts or stu-dent arrests.
UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes 
said UF had to deal with false ru-mors recently but through a differ-ent channel.
“It was concerning to us when 
there were some false rumors post-ed on Twitter during the height of concerns about assaults on cam-
pus,” Sikes said. “Our social me-
dia director saw it, and we worked hard to get the correct information out immediately.”
Sikes said students should 
check their email and texts, as well as UF’s Twitter and homepage for the facts.
She and UF social media direc-
tor Todd Sanders said the UF fact hotline was made to dismiss these online rumors.
“Things in the real-time nature of the social web, there’s so much information out there, and not all of it is factual,” Sanders said.
Sanders said social media is not 
actively monitored for rumors.
“When we’re aware of things, 
we definitely address them to re-lieve any unnecessary anxieties,” he said.
GPD spokesman Officer Ben 
Tobias said he doesn’t think social media sites like Yik Yak are neces-sarily a threat to campus safety. If anyone has an issue with pub-lic safety or hears a rumor, GPD always recommends checking its official social media channels, as 
well as UF’s for information.
“We do rumor patrol as best 
as possible,” Tobias said. “With 
social media being so broad, it’s very difficult to put an end to all rumors. Just because you throw an anonymous tag on something, it makes that a little more prevalent. False rumors and criminal activity 
are two different things.”

“If you’re going to look to an 
anonymous site for information, you’re looking in the wrong place,” 
Tobias said.Some students, like UF chemis-
try senior George Book, said that 
when he and his friends read ru-mors on Yik Yak, they do more re-
search to verify it.
“I think people shouldn’t be-

Sikes said UF has worked hard 
with social media to make sure all 
the correct information is available 
to students.
“It just requires additional ef-
forts on our parts, which is fine,” she said, “but it’s important to re-mind students that they need to get their information from official channels, especially when it relates to emergency situations or campus 
safety or security.”

Mexican man’s ‘Harry Pot-
ter’ hoard is world’s largest
MEXICO CITY  — A Mexico 
City man is in Hogwarts heav-
en after his collection of “Har-
ry Potter” memorabilia was 
named the world’s largest.
Menahem Asher Silva Var-
gas has spent nearly 15 years hoarding all things related to British author J.K. Rowling’s young-adult wizard-fantasy series, which spawned eight blockbuster films.
His collection fills two rooms 
and counts everything from magic wands and toy figurines to Gryffindor scarves and rep-lica Quidditch brooms.
Guinness World Records of-
ficially recognized it Monday as the world’s largest at 3,097 pieces. The old mark was 807.
Silva Vargas said he began 
with no intent to amass a huge collection.
He laughingly called his ob-
session both a blessing and a curse. “My salary, my bonuses ... it all ended up here.”
Charges dropped for man 
who sold rhino head
MILTON, N.H. — A New 
Hampshire man who tried to sell a 70-pound rhinoceros head is happy that charges against him have been dropped.
Ari Goldenberg of Milton 
was charged by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 2012 
with selling an endangered 
species and falsifying records. Local media report that there is no proof he broke any laws.
Goldenberg said the black 
rhino head was part of a collec-tion donated to Phillips Exeter Academy in the 1930s. A wom-an bought it from the school 
and sold the rhino to him sev-
eral years ago. He said he has the paperwork for it.He put an ad to sell it on 
Craigslist. A buyer willing to pay $35,000 turned out to be an undercover wildlife agent who 
confiscated the rhino.
Imprisoned Dutch killer Jo-
ran van der Sloot now a father
LIMA, Peru — Imprisoned 
Dutch killer Joran van der Sloot 
is now a father.
Van der Sloot’s attorney 
Maximo Altez says the girl was 
born Sunday in Lima, Peru 
— far from the remote prison where van der Sloot is serving a 28-year sentence for killing a Peruvian business student in 2010. He also remains the chief suspect in the 2005 disappear-ance of U.S. teenager Natalee Holloway in Aruba.
Altez says the child is named 
Dushy after van der Sloot’s grandmother.
Van der Sloot married 
24-year-old Leidy Figueroa in July. A month later, authorities sent him to a prison high in the Andes, saying he had threat-ened to kill the warden of the 
lockup near Lima.

The U.N. General Assembly room has been welcoming 
a lot of celebrity guests lately.
Last week, Emma Watson gave a signiﬁ  cant speech 
on gender equality. She was followed by Leonardo Di-Caprio’s important but ineffectual plea for action on climate 
change.
On Monday, the delegates got to hear from Benjamin 
“Bibi” Netanyahu, prime minister of Israel and self-pro-
claimed Defeater of Terrorists.
He opened his speech with a passionate and truly beauti-
ful story of the Jewish people’s struggles throughout history. It was inspiring and hopeful. Then came the rhetoric.
Bibi took advantage of the world’s intense, justiﬁ  ed fear 
of ISIS to bring up his favorite talking point: Iran is bad.
There are signs that the cold relationship between Iran 
and the West is thawing. Iran has been involved in the glob-al coalition to stop ISIS and related extremist movements. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani’s visit to New York last week, and his meetings with prominent political leaders and journalists also suggest that Western relations with Iran are normalizing. Bibi seems disturbed by the extent to which the West is getting comfortable with an enemy of Israel.
It’s important to understand the target audience of Netan-
yahu’s speech. Bibi was, of course, speaking directly to the U.N. General Assembly. However, the fact that he spoke in English and made a ham-ﬁ  sted reference to Derek Jeter sug-gests that his true target was the American public.
Netanyahu’s speech was overwhelmingly comprehen-
sive. There was a brief period where he defended the Israeli Defence Forces’ bombing of Palestinian schools. The rest of the speech focused on the dangers of Islamic extremism, while grossly oversimplifying the nuances of the Israeli-Pal-
estinian conﬂ  ict. After another reminder of how scary ISIS 
is, he claimed that Hamas and ISIS are two sides of the same coin. Never mind that Hamas’ endorsement of Palestinian nationalism over the formation of a Pan-Islamic state makes the organization, in the eyes of ISIS, apostates worthy of de-capitation.
Turning his focus to Iran, Netanyahu tells us that all of the 
recent ofﬁ  cial condemnations against terrorism and Islamic extremism that we’ve been hear-ing from Rouhani are “crocodile tears” and that we shouldn’t be fooled by such obvious attempts to curry favor with the West.
Netanyahu claimed that Rou-
hani’s real goal is to acquire enough uranium to build a nucle-ar weapon. Once that happens, he warned, Iran’s role as the orches-
trator of terrorism worldwide will become overt.
He not-so-subtly implied that Iran would be willing to 
give the Islamic State weapons of mass destruction, an ab-solutely ridiculous claim. Iran is predominantly Shia, which 
means Sunni-led ISIS likely hates them even more than they 
hate the United States.
Netanyahu could have used the threat of ISIS and Rou-
hani’s willingness to reach out to the West as an opportunity to advocate for a peaceful solution to the conﬂ  icts in the Mid-dle East and beyond. Instead, Netanyahu chose to portray Rouhani as a shifty-eyed, malevolent ﬁ  gure eager to supply terrorist groups around the world with nuclear weapons.
The only way this sort of appeal could work is if the gen-
eral public was somehow massively unaware of what actual-ly happens in the Middle East. Unfortunately, that is exactly the case today.
Iran isn’t exactly a shining example of freedom and de-
mocracy, but that’s no reason to doubt that Rouhani’s op-position to ISIS is genuine.
Here’s something you’re unlikely to hear about Iran on 
cable news: Christians and Jews are legally protected by Iran’s constitution and are guaranteed seats in the Iranian 
parliament.  However, that doesn’t ﬁ  t into the fearmongers’ 
narrative that conﬂ  ates all Muslim groups and nations to-gether. Those who are loudly beating the war drums won’t give up until we engage in another round of self-righteous hellﬁ  re, $1.6 million missiles blowing everything to smither-eens as any hope for peace goes down in ﬂ  ames.

law is necessary? Next governor 
must address Fla. 
prison issues
In his former life as a Republican state senator, Democratic 
gubernatorial nominee Charlie Crist was known for being tough on crime.
Crist was the sponsor of a 1995 law that requires Florida in-
mates to serve at least 85 percent of their prison sentences.
Although the law was designed to avoid judicial leniency to-
ward violent criminals, the law has most severely affected non-violent offenders, such as those convicted of drug possession.
The Crist-supported 85 percent law has combined with Flor-
ida’s mandatory minimum sentencing rules to force thousands of nonviolent offenders into onerous prison sentences dispro-portionate to the severity of their crimes.
To Crist’s credit, he has suggested that both the 85 percent 
law and mandatory minimums should be revisited, though he 
still believes the law he sponsored is a “good policy.”
Ironically, a strong supporter of the 85 percent law during the 
2014 campaign has been Crist’s opponent, Gov. Rick Scott.
Jackie Schutz, a spokeswoman for Scott, has made the gover-
nor’s support for the 85 percent law very clear. “Over the next 
four years, Gov. Scott will protect Florida’s 85 percent rule to ensure that we do not lose ground on making our state safer,” she said.
Florida’s sentencing guidelines aren’t the only serious issue 
within the state’s prison and criminal justice systems. A recent report from the Palm Beach Post uncovered severe shortcom-ings in Florida’s privatized prison health care system.
According to the Post’s report, monthly inmate deaths 
reached a 10-year high of 36 in January of this year, 100 days after the prison system had its health care fully privatized.
If inmate deaths continue at their current rate, the total for 
2014 will be nearly 5 percent higher than the previous high of 313 two years ago. The Post’s investigation found horror stories 
of mistreatment and neglect. One patient’s terminal lung cancer 
went undiagnosed, and her symptoms were treated with Tyle-nol and warm compresses.
Scott has strongly supported health care privatization during 
his ﬁ  rst term, claiming the move would save taxpayers millions of dollars, while improving the quality of care. However, since the state of Florida signed a $1 billion contract with Corizon Inc., the prison health care system has rapidly deteriorated.
Advocating for fair and reasonable treatment of inmates isn’t 
being soft on crime. The Constitution forbids cruel and unusual punishment, and the despicable treatment of Florida’s prisoners almost certainly qualiﬁ  es as such.
Even ignoring the Constitution’s requirements, all human 
beings deserve to be treated with basic dignity and respect, in-cluding prison inmates. This isn’t just a criminal justice issue, but also a matter of human rights.
It’s obvious that Florida’s criminal justice and prison systems 
are in severe need of reform. Unfortunately, neither Crist nor 
Scott has so far made a ﬁ  rm commitment to addressing this issue 
in the coming years.

On Nov. 4, Floridians will vote on an initiated 
constitutional amendment called Florida Right to Medical Marijuana Initiative or Amendment 
2.
The Florida Right to Medical Marijuana Initiative 
legalizes the medical use of marijuana by patients, ad-ministration of marijuana by caregivers, recommenda-
tions by licensed physicians and the sale of marijuana by 
medical marijuana treatment centers. 
I support the legalization of medical marijuana. I want 
those in serious pain and suffering to ﬁ  nd relief through the medical beneﬁ  ts of marijuana. However, Amendment 2 
is deeply ﬂ  awed.
If Amendment 2 passes, it will be abused. Its terminology 
is too broad, and it leaves too much power in the hands of 
licensed physicians and the Florida Department of Health.
This all sounds reasonable. However, the devil is in the 
details.
The initiative allows licensed physicians to recommend 
marijuana to patients for a “debilitating medical condi-tion,” or “other conditions” where the physician believes 
medical marijuana is appropriate for relief. 
Most established, licensed Florida physicians would not 
abuse the recommendation of medical marijuana. Howev-
er, the ability of physicians to prescribe medical marijuana 
may have unintended consequences.
California approved the use of medical marijuana in 
1996. Since then, “Pot Doc” shops have popped up every-
where. Greg Warmoth, Orlando’s Channel 9 reporter,  visit-ed California in November 2013 for an investigative report, 
which unearthed the unintended consequences of medical 
marijuana. 
Warmoth went to a licensed physician for a medical 
marijuana recommendation. He was encouraged to say he 
had trouble sleeping and was then given a recommenda-
tion for medical marijuana by the licensed physician. He proceeded to a “Pot Doc” shop and bought his marijuana.
The licensed physician was a gynecologist who opened 
the “Pot Doc” shop on the side for extra money. This same 
situation has the potential to occur in Florida if Amend-
ment 2 passes.
The situation is complicated by medical marijuana not 
being approved by the Food and Drug Administration. 
Prescribing marijuana is illegal, so as the legislation cur-
rently stands, doctors who recommend it have no control over dosages.  
When patients purchase pot, it will not be bought from 
a reputable doctor’s ofﬁ  ce. Under Amendment 2, someone 
with no pharmaceutical or medical experience, no license and no training can sell pot. 
Also, Amendment 2 provides no 
guidelines for the location of these “Pot Docs.” They could open up shop 
anywhere — next to schools or resi-dential neighborhoods.
The buyer, especially one who is 
not suffering a debilitating disease, could then leave the shop and light up anywhere. 
In the footage from Warmoth’s 
California report, people line the streets smoking blunts. 
Keep in mind, recreational marijuana is not legal in Cali-
fornia. 
If Amendment 2 passes, the Florida Department of 
Health (FDOH) will be left to work out the details. The de-
partment creates procedures the medical marijuana treat-
ment centers or “Pot Docs” have to follow and also creates regulations for how much marijuana patients can obtain. 
Some might argue that the Florida Department of Health 
is highly qualiﬁ  ed to make these important decisions, cer-
tainly more so than state legislators.
However, the Florida Medical Association, which is a 
professional association that represents doctors in legisla-
tion, public health and other affairs voted unanimously 
against the support of Amendment 2. 
Madelyn Butler, a past president of the FMA, says she 
agrees with seven former Florida Supreme Court justices 
who joined together opposing Amendment 2. They said, “Anyone who reads the full text of Amendment 2 should 
readily agree it is plagued by loopholes and vagueness that 
would lead to a myriad of unintended and undesirable con-sequences.” 
People on both sides of the medical marijuana debate 
have sensationalized this issue. Scare tactics from the op-position that suggest Amendment 2 will allow drug dealers to move in next door are overdramatic.
Commercials in favor of Amendment 2 that appeal only 
to emotion, like those from the Morgan Law Firm, which 
gave $3,535,897 in Amendment 2 campaign funds, leave 
out important logistical concerns about legalizing medical marijuana.  
Amendment 2  is too broad and contains too many loop-
holes for the abuse of medical marijuana. Those who truly need medical marijuana treatment deserve it, but the pas-sage of Amendment 2 is not in the state of Florida’s best interest.

opinions@alligator.orgThose who identify with the right wing 
of the political spectrum are often as-sociated with the image of the “bad 
guy” — the evil, clever insider who abuses the government to protect his friends, his money, his guns and his traditional values. But con-servatives, especially in Texas, don’t break a 
sweat when it comes to discussing jobs and the 
economy.
With Republicans 
controlling the Texas government, the case 
for conservative ﬁ  scal 
policy makes itself: No one can deny the “Texas Miracle” phenom-enon of economic growth for which quintes-
sentially conservative ideals of low taxes and 
decreased government regulation are suppos-edly responsible. Unfortunately, the lack of synergy between ﬁ  scal conservatives and so-cial progressives in Texas leaves independent 
voters with a difﬁ  cult decision to make in No-
vember.
Over the course of the gubernatorial elec-
tion campaigns, both candidates have ex-
pressed interest in continuing the successful 
legacy of the Texas economy, but the econom-ic plan proffered by state Sen. Wendy Davis is not tenable, and conservative ﬁ  scal policy, though ﬂ  awed, makes the most sense for our state.
It would be nice if the “Texas Miracle” were 
the result of growth of high-paying jobs across the state, but the reality is that this miracle is mainly sustained by minimum-wage jobs. And although the hope among all is not to have to 
scramble for a minimum-wage job, the real-
ity is that many people have to, or at least do their best to, support their families on $7.25 an hour. The solution to this problem, however, 
is not to simply increase minimum wage. In-
stead, the state ﬁ  scal policy should focus on attracting more companies to Texas.
Davis, the Democratic gubernatorial candi-
date, has proposed a minimum wage increase 
of $10 per hour, which would immediately 
help many Texans living below the poverty line.
Unfortunately, common sense shows that 
such an immediate increase has clearly nega-tive consequences for the same workers the increase should be helping. If employers’ costs increase immediately, this would force them to to decrease the number of people they em-
ploy in order to minimize costs and maximize 
their proﬁ  ts. Increasing minimum wage could possibly derail the “Texas Miracle” in the long run.
Conversely, conservatives and liberals 
alike should consider the moral implications 
of sustaining this so-called miracle. Should we 
pride ourselves on the fact that our economy is growing because an obscene number of grown adults are earning minimum wage, whether 
it be $7.25 or $10 per hour? Perhaps, both gu-
bernatorial candidates should consider the an-swer to that question when developing state ﬁ  scal policy.

A UF student has made a splash in the 
marine science community.
Monica Camacho, 19, was awarded 
a $1,000 travel scholarship to present re-
search she collected this past summer at the national conference of the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology in January.
The scholarship was awarded to her by 
the National Science Foundation, which also funded the Research Experience for 
Undergraduate program at UF’s Whitney 
Laboratory for Marine Bioscience.
“I was interested in doing research to 
see if that was something that I wanted to do in the future because I love the sciences, and I found the Whitney Lab,” Camacho, an environmental engineering sophomore, said.
Camacho said she first became interest-
ed in Marine Biology while growing up in Key Largo, Florida.
Camacho earned one of eight competi-
tive internship spots in the Research Ex-perience for Undergraduate program this summer, where she gathered data on the ecological impact of black mangrove trees expanding into saltmarsh ecosystems.
Camacho worked on the coastal and 
marine ecology project with Todd Os-
borne, UF assistant professor of estuarine 
biogeochemistry, during her internship in St. Augustine, Florida.
The program at the Whitney Laboratory 
is a paid, 11-week internship that received about 230 applicants last year. 
Alumni of the program go on to be suc-
cessful in various science careers, said Jes-sica Long, the director of development and external relations for Whitney Laboratory.  
“They are science writers, science 
teachers, several are physicians, and one of them is now a professor at Penn State 
who is doing research,” Long said.
At the January conference, Camacho 
will attend alongside a variety of scientists 
from marine biologists to environmental scientists to geneticists, Osborne said.“The conference is a good opportunity 
for her to present work to a large audience, and it gives her the opportunity to explore different fields (of science),” he said.
Camacho was awarded the travel schol-
arship after submitting a poster of her data to the National Science Foundation.  
During her internship, Camacho took 
part in a science communication course that she said will help her present her data at the national conference in West Palm Beach, Florida.
“I’m excited to explain research that no 
one has ever done before,” she said.
But Camacho isn’t stopping with her 
presentation. Osborne and Camacho are working to publish a paper based on the 
data Camacho has collected over the sum-
mer. 
She is in the process of writing rough 
drafts of manuscripts and having Osborne give her feedback. UF student wins travel scholarship for marine science research

DALLAS — A patient at a 
Dallas hospital has tested posi-
tive for Ebola, the first case of the disease to be diagnosed in the U.S., federal health officials 
announced Tuesday.
The patient was in isolation 
at Texas Health Presbyterian 
Hospital, which had announced a day earlier that the person’s symptoms and recent travel in-dicated a possible case of Ebola, the virus that has killed more than 3,000 people across West 
Africa and infected a handful of 
Americans who have traveled to that region.
The person developed 
symptoms days after return-ing to Texas from Liberia and 
showed no symptoms on the 
plane, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-vention.
CDC Director Dr. Tom Frie-
den said the patient came to the U.S. to visit family and has been hospitalized since the weekend. Health officials said no other cases are suspected in Texas.
Specimens from the patient 
were tested by a state lab and 
confirmed by a separate test by 
the CDC, said Carrie Williams, spokeswoman for the Texas Department of State Health Services.
Zachary Thompson, director 
of Dallas County Health & Hu-man Services, said officials in North Texas are well equipped 
to care for the patient.
“This is not Africa,” he told 
Dallas station WFAA. “We 
have a great infrastructure to deal with an outbreak.”
Twelve other people in the 
U.S. have been tested for Ebola 
since July 27, according to the 
CDC: All were negative.
Four American aid work-
ers who became infected while volunteering in West Africa have been treated in special 
isolation facilities in hospitals 
in Atlanta and Nebraska, and a U.S. doctor exposed to the virus in Sierra Leone is under obser-vation in a similar facility at the National Institutes of Health.
The U.S. has only four such 
isolation units, but the CDC has insisted that any hospital can care for someone with Ebola.
Ebola symptoms can include 
fever, muscle pain, vomiting 
and bleeding, and can appear 
as long as 21 days after expo-sure to the virus.
Health officials use two pri-
mary guidelines when decid-ing whether to test a person for the virus — whether that per-son has traveled to West Africa and whether he or she has been 
near friends or relatives or other 
people who have been exposed to the virus, said CDC spokes-man Jason McDonald.
Since the summer months, 
U.S. health officials have been preparing for the possibil-
ity that an individual traveler 
could unknowingly arrive with the infection. Authorities have advised hospitals on how to prevent the virus from spread-ing within their facilities.
People boarding planes in 
the outbreak zone are checked 
for fever, but that does not 
guarantee that an infected per-son won’t get through. Ebola is not contagious until symptoms begin, and it takes close contact with bodily fluids to spread.Dallas hospital

JACKSONVILLE — Michael 
Dunn was shooting to kill, not de-
fending himself, when he fired at 17-year-old Jordan Davis after the two had an argument over loud 
music outside a Jacksonville conve-
nience store, prosecutors said dur-ing closing arguments on Tuesday in the second trial in the case.
Closings began after the 47-year-
old Dunn took the witness stand in his own defense, saying he feared for his life when he opened fire in November 2012.
“He wasn’t shooting at the tires. 
He wasn’t shooting at the windows. He was shooting to kill. Aiming at Jordan Davis,” prosecutor Erin Wolfson told jurors.
Jurors will hear instructions from 
the judge this morning and will then begin deliberations.Prosecutors say Dunn killed Da-
vis, of Marietta, Georgia, when he fired 10 times into an SUV carrying four teenagers.
Dunn was convicted of three 
counts of attempted second-degree 
murder in Febru-
ary and already faces at least 60 years in prison.
The jury in the 
first trial dead-locked on the 
first-degree mur-
der count.
Dunn said the 
problems started when he and his fiancee heard loud bass thumping from an SUV parked next to them at a convenience store.
Testimony from the other teen-
agers in the case said Dunn was an-
gry when he asked them to turn the 
music down.The music was turned off for a 
short time, Dunn said. He said he was not angry when the music was turned back up, but then things got 
heated.
Dunn said the man in the back-
seat then rolled the window down 
and flashed a gun.
“I would have pulled it 50 times 
if that’s what it took to save my life,” Dunn said.
On cross-examination, prosecu-
tor John Guy asked Dunn if he knew 
anyone had been hurt when he 
started firing into the rear passenger door, and Dunn said no.
Then Dunn told Guy that Davis 
was outside the car when he was fir-ing.
Dunn said he didn’t think that 
he’d hurt anyone, and prosecutors told jurors that he went back to his 
hotel and went to sleep.Loud-music-shooting trial nears end

ORLANDO — A former 
University of Central Florida 
football assistant coach is suing the university and the athletic department for breach of con-
tract, alleging that coach George 
O’Leary engaged in continuous criticism of his work and cre-ated a work environment that included bullying, threatening behavior and repeated discrim-inatory epithets.
Former defensive coordina-
tor Paul Ferraro filed the suit in 
Florida last week. The suit al-
leges O’Leary made derogatory remarks about Ferraro’s Italian heritage, African-Americans and people of Jewish descent.
Ferraro was hired as the de-
fensive coordinator on Dec. 26 of last year, following the de-parture of Jim Fleming. 
Ferraro states in the suit that 
he was given a termination letter on Feb. 26, a day after he voiced his concerns to the school’s hu-man resources department and in an email to O’Leary and his fellow assistant coaches.
That email was attached as 
an exhibit to the lawsuit.
UCF spokesman Grant 
Heston said in a statement that the school previously investi-gated Ferraro’s accusations.
“UCF immediately investi-
gated the allegations Mr. Fer-raro made when he abruptly abandoned his job,” the state-ment said. “The university’s 
Equal Opportunity and Affir-
mative Action office found the allegations to be untrue.
“None of the individuals al-
leged to have been the subject of, or to have overhead, these supposed statements corrobo-rated Mr. Ferraro’s claims. In fact, until seeking compensation after abandoning his job, it does not appear he ever discussed 
this with anyone at UCF.”
Ferraro maintains he never 
actually resigned from his post.
Asked why Ferraro waited 
months to file the suit, Ferraro’s 
attorney, Gary Wilson, wrote in an email to The Associated Press that it was delayed in an effort “to resolve this pre-suit 
and without publicity.”
“We respect what UCF 
means to the Central Florida 
community and we applaud UCF’s accomplishments both on and off the football field,” Wilson’s law firm said in a statement. “However, Coach Ferraro deserves representation 
like anyone else who has been 
wronged. We are simply acting as his voice and intend no harm toward UCF or (University of Central Florida Athletic Asso-ciation).”
According to the suit, Ferra-
ro was asked by O’Leary to de-lay assuming his coaching du-
ties until after the Fiesta Bowl. 
Interim coordinator Tyson Summers coached the Knights defense in that game.
Afterward, when Ferraro 
began his job, he said that O’Leary contradicted previous desires to simplify the defen-sive schemes and claims that 
O’Leary “micromanaged” him 
and “engaged in continuous and unwarranted criticism” of his work.Former assistant

Richard Nelson Forte Jr., 26, got into a fight with 
two witnesses and the victim — who he knew was pregnant — while trying to retrieve his keys and cellphone charger from the victim’s residence at 
3101 NE 15th St.
Gainesville Police said Forte spent the night at 
the residence Sunday. Although the victim did not 
let him in again at about 9 a.m. Monday, Forte was able to get inside.
Once inside, he went to the victim’s bedroom to retrieve his belongings. The victim and a witness 
tried again to make him leave, igniting a fight be-
tween Forte and one of the witnesses, according to a report.
The victim intervened to try to 
make Forte leave again. Forte then 
punched the 2-month pregnant 
victim’s stomach.
The victim told police Forte was 
aware of her pregnancy because he 
went to the doctor’s appointment 
when they were both notified.
After he was read his rights, 
Forte denied ever hitting the victim.
He was arrested on charges of aggravated battery 
of a pregnant female. His bond is set at $10,000.Police: Gainesville man punched 
pregnant woman in the stomach

Florida players like Kurt Roper.
Heading into the season, running back Matt Jones 
called the new offensive coordinator loose and “more ex-citing than (former offensive coordinator Brent) Pease.”
Wide receiver Valdez Showers liked the up-tempo feel 
Roper brings to practice.
Quarterback Jeff Driskel said Roper keeps the offense 
humble.
But heading into Florida’s road contest against Tennes-
see — and following a 42-21 loss to Alabama in which the Gators tallied just 200 yards of offense — Roper wants to make sure everyone knows that performance comes be-fore the fun and games.
“I hope I stay who I am,” Roper said. “When you go to 
the practice ﬁ  eld, I think the big thing is I don’t want to put out the perception that when I’m on the practice ﬁ  eld it’s all fun and games. 
“I mean, there is a mentality, a toughness mentality, a 
focus mentality, and an effort mentality. And so, I don’t think that’s changed at all. … My whole philosophy is if we’ve got guys trying and giving effort, then we’ll coach 
ya. If we have to coach the effort and those things, that’s 
when we’re not fun to be around.”
The Gators have struggled converting third downs this 
season. Through three games, Florida has a 34-percent conversion rate, which is 109th in the country and 13th in the Southeastern Conference.
Against Alabama, Florida moved the chains on just 
two of its 13 third-down attempts.
But when the average distance to go on third down is 
7.8 yards, a low conversion rate is bound to occur.
“(We) played too many bad downs and distances,” 
Roper said. “I don’t think we ever kept ourselves in good situations that way, which created a bunch of third-and-longs rather than obviously the third-and-shorts and 
third-and-mediums. 
“So I don’t think we were very productive, really any 
down and distance. But I think because of our poor pro-
duction on our early downs we really struggled on our third downs against a good defense.”
Florida’s troubles on offense seem to be put solely on 
Driskel’s back.
But Roper reiterated Muschamp in saying the redshirt 
junior is Florida’s best quarterback to win games at this 
point in the season.
The ﬁ  rst-year UF offensive coordinator said that 
Driskel has attempted 37 drop back passes on third down 
this season, and the coaching staff has needed to be criti-cal on just eight of the attempts.
“On the other 29, they were either good decisions or 
we didn’t make the play,” Roper said. “Not saying we made the play on all 29, but Jeff was solid in decision-making and the throw. It’s a team thing. We’ve got a guy 
that understands the game that is a tough-minded guy 
and has the ability to make plays for us.”
Driskel has been at the root of the blame among Flor-
ida’s fan base, but Roper said the criticism for Florida’s offensive ineptitude against Alabama can not fall on just one player.
“It’s not just (Driskel),” Roper said. “He threw a couple 
of interceptions on third-and-longs when I put him in an aggressive call in the mind set of trying to make a play. 
So it’s all around. It’s me as a play-caller, it’s him as a de-
cision-maker, it’s just the route-running, all of it together we’ve just got to get better at.”
And Driskel’s teammates have the same mentality.“It’s been tough for him because he’s getting the steam 
right at him,” Jones said. “But we know it’s a team ef-fort. Yeah, as quarterback, he takes the heat for the whole thing, but we’re trying to lift him up. … We’re not against him.”
Despite all the struggles and all the improvements that 
need to be made, Roper said that Florida’s offense has found its identity.
“You know, I think you’re always growing and chang-
ing,” Roper said, “but I think we’ve got a pretty good feel of who we are and what we are.”

UF quarterback Jeff Driskel (6) rushes during Florida’s 42-21 loss to Alabama on Sept. 20. Driskel has received the bulk 
of the criticism for the Gators’ struggling offense, but offensive coordinator Kurt Roper said the blame is on everyone.
Roper focused on improving offense production on all downs
JOHNSON’S JOURNAL
Woody and Buzz, peanut butter and 
jelly, macaroni and cheese. Each is so synonymous with the other that 
it’s tough to think of one without its coun-terpart.
Add Jeff Driskel and Will Muschamp to 
that list, because that’s where that relation-
ship seems to be going.
It’s different than just the standard coach-
player bond. 
Perhaps Muschamp knows the stakes; 
he knows how much his reputation rides on the arm of No. 6 and because of that, he so vociferously defends a player he didn’t even recruit. 
Maybe it’s just Muschamp orchestrating a 
different kind of defense — not one to stymie opponents but one to block the blitz of nega-tivity from fans and media alike (including this newspaper).
Muschamp marginalized the amount 
of fans who have fallen out of favor with Driskel, referring to the number as “a few” which is frankly not true in my mind and maybe in his too despite what he said pub-licly. 
Muschamp is taking bullets, deﬂ  ecting 
negativity, trying to lessen its impact and mitigate its ef-fect on his sig-nal caller and the team at large. That’s what coaches do, that’s what 
fathers do. 
And often-
times you’ll hear 
coaches say they toe the line between those 
two roles with their student-athletes.
The pressure and the vitriol are occupa-
tional hazards of the job of quarterbacking at the University of Florida, and for his part, Driskel said Monday he doesn’t need his coach to come to his defense — he is a big boy and he can handle it. 
He said he was “grown” and even 
laughed off his plight by joking about how thankful he was that Monday was the start 
of a new week.
There is nothing wrong with defending 
your players. It’s what coaches are supposed 
to do. 
Nothing good comes from publicly blast-
ing a 21-year-old in the media no matter how 
Muschamp completely invested in Driskel at quarterback

Brooke Sharp celebrates with teammates after scoring the opening goal in Florida’s 2-1 win against 
Georgia on Friday at James G. Pressly Stadium.

Alligator Writer @alexmaminakis
For a sophomore forward who, 
until last weekend, had started ev-
ery game this season on the bench, getting to start two games in a row was not an opportunity to waste.
Brooke Sharp certainly made the 
most of it. 
The Ponte Vedra, Fla., native 
made her first starting appearance of the season on Friday night against Georgia and then her second start of the season two days later against Missouri.
Sharp scored her third goal of the 
year against Georgia — the first goal of the game — while recording four shots. Her three goals are the second most on the team behind sophomore Savannah Jordan.
“I wasn’t expecting to start, 
but I was happy to,” Sharp said. “I just made the most of it and went out there with confidence that the coaches trusted me to start.”
Coach Becky Burleigh spoke 
highly of Sharp and her ability to maintain possession and orchestrate positive plays on offense. 
Burleigh has also seen improve-
ment in Sharp compared to last sea-son.
“With Brooke, when the ball goes 
into her feet it’s really, really hard to knock her off the ball,” Burleigh said. “She’s strong, she’s got a low center of gravity and what she has improved upon, I think she’s mak-
ing better decisions off the ball.”
In her freshman season, Sharp 
started only one match and had one 
goal all year. 
Sharp said she worked hard in 
the offseason to better understand Florida’s formations and game plans so that she could be a stronger asset to the team this year.
“I was really happy,” Sharp said of her performance last weekend. “I felt like I improved from last year, so that was a good confidence booster.”
It is not as if Sharp didn’t play 
much at all in her freshman season. 
She played in 12 games and logged 
322 minutes of action last year. 
But in those 12 games, Sharp’s 
offensive output wasn’t where she would have liked it to be, logging just four points. 
One year later, she is making her 
minutes count and emerging as one of Florida’s leading offensive weap-
ons.
Burleigh has recognized the im-
provements in Sharp this year and 
doesn’t doubt that the sophomore will help the team succeed as it pro-gresses through the latter portion of its schedule.
“I think her playing time is just 
going to continue to increase,” Bur-
leigh said.Sharp makes big impact for UF soccer

As the Florida women’s 
swimming and diving team 
puts its first victory of the 
season from last Saturday 
behind, it looks ahead to the three-day Pinch A Penny In-vitational this weekend along 
with the men’s team. 
The men’s team makes its 
season debut with a roster 
loaded with depth that in-cludes a total of 12 All-Amer-
icans. 
The Gators’ roster also fea-
tures a total of 10 seniors, six 
of which are All-Americans.
“I think it helps because 
there’s competition everyday at practice,” coach Martyn Wilby said. 
“They take that level of 
swimming to a new height everyday at practice.”  
At the Pinch A Penny Invi-
tational, only three swimmers 
from each school are able to 
swim in the finals regardless of placing in the preliminary heats.
Wilby said there are prob-
ably five or six swimmers on 
the team that are capable of 
being in the final three.
“We see that everyday in 
practice so it takes the whole intensity in practice and fo-
cus level in practice to a new 
level,” Wilby said.
In particular, 2014 South-
eastern Conference Freshman 
Swimmer of the Year Mitch 
D’Arrigo returns to the Gators after competing in two events at the 2014 European Champi-
onships. 
The Italy native earned 
a silver medal in the 400-
meter freestyle and was the 
2014 Italian Spring National 
Champion in the 200-meter freestyle. 
“Well, he had an outstand-
ing summer,” Wilby said. “I 
think that was a continua-
tion of his freshman year. ... It’s just a gradual progression and he now has confidence in 
what he is doing. He under-
stands the college system now and I just see him getting bet-ter and better.” 
What’s also included on 
this deep roster are 10 fresh-men and seven redshirt fresh-men who will be relied upon to contribute to the team’s 
success this season. 
One freshman Wilby 
praised was Caeleb Dressel, 
the No. 3 recruit in the state of Florida and No. 20 in the class 
of 2014 by CollegeSwimming.
com. 
Dressel, out of Jacksonville 
Bolles School, set the national 
high school record for the 50-
yard freestyle with a time of 19.29 seconds, which is faster than any swimmer returning to UF this season posted last 
year.
“Caeleb is the ultimate 
swimmer,” said Wilby. “He 
has come in and is learning. 
He’s a sponge for information 
and so I’m looking forward to seeing him race this weekend and he’s just taking everything in and trying to improve.”UF men’s team gears

Kurt Roper has all the confidence in 
the world that Treon Harris will be a good 
quarterback one day.
But that day will not be Saturday.
If Gator fans needed any more confir-
mation that Jeff Driskel will be Florida’s 
starter against Tennessee this week, Roper 
provided it when he met with the media 
on Tuesday.
“We have 100 percent confidence in Jeff 
right now and he’s the guy we feel like 
we’re going to win football games with,” 
Roper said.
As for Harris, he’s simply not ready yet 
to take on the role of a starter, Roper said. 
Although that’s not saying he won’t be 
prepared down the road, it is saying that Harris has a lot to learn until then.
For that reason, Roper and head coach 
Will Muschamp decided against playing 
the freshman on the road at Alabama.
“(Harris’) understanding is not where 
it needs to be, and that’s not because he 
doesn’t work hard at it or he’s not getting reps,” Roper said. 
“It’s just simply age and number of rep-
etitions and practices he’s had. So, when he goes in, we’re going to ask him to do things that we think that he’s mentally prepared for. 
“But the reason that decision wasn’t 
made is because we feel that Jeff gives us the best opportunity to win football games.”
And per Roper, there’s no bigger be-
liever in Driskel than Harris.
Despite calls from the media and fans 
across the country — including Florida 
Ring of Honor inductee Emmitt Smith — 
Harris has modestly backed Driskel while staying out of the social media circus that is surrounding Florida’s football program.
“I think (Harris) is a grounded young 
man,” Roper said. 
“I think he is a guy that understands 
that he’s just trying to get better every 
week and I don’t think he’s really getting 
caught up in that.
“He is one of Jeff Driskel’s strongest supporters. He loves being in that room, loves being around Jeff, supports Jeff and knows he’s working every day to get better 
and eventually be the quarterback. I enjoy 
being around Treon and he’s just working. 
That’s the best way I can say it.”
And after Demarcus Robinson stirred 
up some controversy when he retweeted a 
tweet that asked followers if they wanted 
to see a new face under Florida’s center, 
running back Matt Jones was direct in 
clearing up any doubt that surrounded Driskel’s standing as the Gators’ starter.
“We’re definitely going to stand behind 
him because we want offense,” Jones said. 
“Everybody makes mistakes and at the 
quarterback position when you make mis-takes, you get criticized a lot for it.
“He’s going to do better and we’re all 
pushing to be great so that’s what we all 
are going to do. We’re going to stand be-
hind him.”
In the middle of all the hoopla is Driskel 
himself, who said he’s managed to stay “even keeled” throughout the bye week 
despite the backlash from fans on social 
media.
For him and the rest of the Gators, it’s 
business as usual no matter what noise en-
velops the team.
“I don’t think there’s any panic in this 
building,” Driskel said. 
“Obviously, we’d like to play better but 
we didn’t … Fans have the right to (over-react) but we’re not panicking here.”WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 1, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15

Backup quarterback Treon Harris takes a snap during Florida’s 65-0 win against 
Eastern Michigan on Sept. 6 at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium. Harris, a true freshman, will not start for the Gators any time soon because of his age and limited reps.
FootbALLRoper: Harris not ready to take on starting quarterback role
Muschamp won’t use Harris in a game unless game dictates it
poorly he played in his last game. 
Keep in mind, Muschamp has 
also admitted Driskel must get bet-
ter — he’s not just ignoring how Driskel has played up until this 
point.
I do find one small thing has 
changed about how the Gators 
plan to use freshman Treon Harris amidst all the calling from people — myself included — for him to be the starter. Florida could have been playing the 2001 Miami Hurricanes or the 1985 Chicago Bears and Har-ris was going into that game in the second quarter of that opener come hell or high-water. 
But that won’t be the case Satur-
day, just like it wasn’t against Ken-tucky or Alabama. 
Harris will play if the situation 
dictates and Muschamp made it clear the Gators won’t be trying a Spurrier-esque two-quarterback rotation. Driskel is the guy — he’s Muschamp’s guy — and he’ll play most of the game.The enduring question is can the 
Gators get into a situation where Muschamp finds it logical to put Harris in the game with Jeff Driskel starting at quarterback?  
And will it still serve as an op-
portunity for Harris to receive snaps in which he can affect the 
outcome of the game (non-garbage 
time situations)? 
This is the chicken-egg situation 
Florida’s quarterback conundrum finds itself in.
Offensive coordinator Kurt Rop-
er said Tuesday Harris isn’t ready mentally because of his age, so now both coach and coordinator are in lockstep defending their guy. 
Roper did defer to the head 
man, though, when he said that Muschamp makes the ultimate call in regards to a quarterback change and also said Driskel gives them 
the best chance to win.
Roper also said only eight of 
Driskel’s 37 third-down drop 
backs that failed were the redshirt junior’s fault.
Whether they believe it or not, 
the party line is Jeff Driskel gives this team the best chance to win. 
I’m not sure if that’s the case on 
the field, and my reservations come from not seeing Harris given the opportunity and full reigns over the offense.
I also think the crux of the unrest 
stems from the fact that Muschamp 
keeps repeating the “Driskel gives 
us the best chance to win” line as a plea to Gators fans to trust him, to trust his judgment and his coach-ing acumen. 
The problem is, I don’t think 
they do.

A team that expected to have a senior presence has 
suddenly found itself in a state of ﬂ  ux, unsure whether 
they’ll be classiﬁ  ed as deep or young.
Mac Reynolds doesn’t care about the classiﬁ  cations.Regardless of who is on the team, the redshirt soph-
omore just wants to race as fast as he can and help lead the Gators this season.
He is on the right track, as he claimed ﬁ  rst place at 
the Western Carolina Invitational to open the season for the Florida men’s cross country team.
“Getting that ﬁ  rst win, yeah that was huge,” Reyn-
olds said. “It’s a smaller race but certainly it was 
great.”
After competing in all seven races last year as a red-
shirt freshman, Reynolds showed ﬂ  ashes of leadership 
and speed that has coach Paul Spangler conﬁ  dent in the 
Gators’ depth.
Reynolds, along with freshmen Thomas Howell and 
William Decker, comprise a young nucleus of runners 
that has the team optimistic about it’s future going for-ward.
In UF’s sole home meet of the season — the Moun-
tain Dew Invitational — Reynolds ﬁ  nished in a career-best 11th place.
Despite the achievements, Reynolds was not satis-
ﬁ  ed.
“I wasn’t pleased with my race,” Reynolds said. “I 
want to run a lot faster, and I can run a lot faster.”
When statements like that are considered, it’s easy to 
see why Spangler is so conﬁ  dent in handing the reins of 
the team to the young guns.
One of the unresolved questions on the team is whether seniors Eddie Garcia and Jimmy Clark will race for the Gators this season.
While all signs point to the pair redshirting this sea-
son and returning next season, Spangler says a verdict 
hasn’t been made yet. 
But with the Wisconsin adidas Invitational coming 
up on Oct. 17, Spangler knows he must solidify who will help lead the team going forward.
“We got a decision to make in the next few weeks 
about whether they’ll compete or not,” Spangler said, 
referring to the statuses of Garcia and Clark. “It de-
pends certainly on how they progress and how the rest of the team progresses.”
With Garcia ﬁ  nishing third at the Mountain Dew 
Invitational, the Gators would have bested Georgia Tech and taken ﬁ  rst place if his points had counted for Florida. 
Instead, UF had to settle for second, leaving the team 
to wonder what might have been if it had the support 
of the seniors.
Despite the seniors absence, Reynolds knows the 
team can meet their lofty goals going forward – even if 
he’s going to avoid setting them.
“We still have a very good shot at going to Nationals 
and placing if we keep working hard,” Reynolds said. “It puts more pressure on us for sure, because those guys are great runners and to ﬁ  ll in for them will be re-ally hard.”Reynolds ready to improve, run
