  For the fourth straight season, 
Florida ﬁ  nds itself undefeated after 
four weeks. 
After shutting out overmatched 
Kentucky at home on Saturday, No. 11 UF (4-0, 3-0 Southeastern Confer-ence) turns its focus to a more difﬁ  -
cult task. 
  Florida has a bye next week before 
taking on No. 3 LSU at home on Oct. 
6.
  Despite the 38-0 win  — the ﬁ  rst 
shutout of a conference opponent in 11 years and the 26th straight win against Kentucky — there’s work to be done for Florida.
  “We’ve got to continue to press 
forward,” Gators coach Will Mus-champ said. 
“We’re not where we want to be. 
We’ve got a lot of things to clean up, 
a lot of errors here and there that we 
need to clean up as we move for-ward.” 
  This situation looks familiar. 
Florida started 4-0 last season be-
fore then-No. 3 Alabama blew UF out 
by 28 points at home. 
  Florida ﬁ  nished the season 3-6 and couldn’t contend with the SEC elite.
This year is supposed to be differ-
ent. 
  “We’re more physical on both 
lines of scrimmage,” Muschamp said. “We’re tied together better as far as what we are and what we want to 
be because we’re better on both lines 
of scrimmage. We’re deeper. We’re more mature. We handle things a lot better. We’re a year older, [and we’re] more experienced.”
  The bye week comes at a conve-
nient time for Florida, which was without several key players against Kentucky.
  Trey Burton missed the game with 
back spasms, defensive end Domin-ique Easley was unavailable because 
of swelling in his left knee and line-
backer Jelani Jenkins still had his right arm in a cast.
  The depleted Florida defense, 
which lost defensive tackle Sharrif 
Floyd to a shoulder injury in the sec-
ond quarter, picked up a sluggish of-fense.
  As a group, Florida had its best de-
fensive performance of the season in the passing game.

The search for a UF student who disap-
peared Thursday night continued over the 
weekend as friends, family and local police departments looked for him in northwest Gainesville.
Christian Aguilar, an 18-year-old bio-
medical engineering freshman from Miami, was last seen at about 6 p.m. Thursday after he was dropped off in a parking lot on the 4900 block of Northwest 13th Street, accord-ing to a GPD news release.
Aguilar’s friends and family haven’t seen 
or heard from him since he disappeared.
GPD described Aguilar as a 5-foot-3-inch 
Hispanic male, wearing a hoodie and jeans, according to the release. He is also reported to have a history of depression.
GPD spokesman Ofﬁ  cer Ben Tobias said 
Aguilar got out of the car near Streit’s Mo-
torsports and added that foul play may be involved in the disappearance.
“We believe there may 
have been an argument and a physical ﬁ  ght,” To-
bias said.
Police have identiﬁ  ed 
Pedro Bravo as a person of interest in the inci-
dent.

After Florida Gov. Rick Scott’s initial vot-
ing purge of potential noncitizens was over, 
one Alachua County voter was removed.
Four names — including at least one UF 
student — were on the 2012 list of people who would potentially be kicked off the 
voting rolls, according to Alachua County Supervisor of Elections Pam Carpenter.
“Here in Alachua County, it was not a huge story,” she said.
There was an original list of 180,000 po-
tential noncitizen voters across the state, Carpenter said. She said it caused uproar in larger cities such as Miami and Tampa 
because there are signiﬁ  cantly more people 
in those areas, which meant their lists were longer.
Since the list was released, some have 
taken the issue to court, including UF pro-fessor Daniel Smith who is giving expert 
testimony in one of those cases.
Smith, a political science professor, spoke 
with a UF graduate student whose name was on the initial list of 180,000 people.

Gainesville pizzerias are raking 
in the dough this year.
Sales at pizza restaurants nation-
wide will reach $36.1 billion at the 
end of 2012, which is up 3.8 percent 
from 2011, according to a study 
released on Sept. 17 by Packaged Facts, a market research company for consumer goods. 
Some Gainesville pizza restau-
rants said they are enjoying the ef-fects of the national increase.
Paul Gillespie, owner of two of 
the three Five Star Pizza restaurants 
in Gainesville, said there is an in-
crease in sales compared to 2011. 
He said 2008 was the busiest year 
ever for his restaurants, but he said this year will become the second busiest. Pepperoni is his best seller.
Gillespie said the restaurant is 
doing a bit better than it was this time last year.
“As of the end of August, Five 
Star was up 2.3 percent for the year,” he said.
Jen Silva, manager of the Pizza 
Hut on Archer Road, said her res-taurant is doing better than the na-tional percent increase.
“As a whole, more than that av-
erage at this location,” she said. “At least a 5 to 10 percent increase since last year. We are doing very well.”
Leonardo’s By the Slice manager 
Mike McGuire said the business is 
doing well, but it is still too early to tell, since the restaurant’s main cli-
entele is students and because it is the beginning of football season.
With a plastic fork and knife in 
hand, Aultemar Martins ate two slices of pizza covered in sausage 
and other meats in the Reitz Union. The 18-year-old, who moved 
from Angola three months ago, is 
learning English at UF.  He said he eats pizza about three times a week.
“Pizza is the easiest lunch,” he 
said. “I prefer Pizza Hut because it’s 
the easiest to order online.”MONDAY, SEPTEMBER, 24, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 3
Sept. 25, 1974: A Gainesville Urban Area Transportation 
Study report indicated air pollution in Gainesville was below 
federal standards. Gainesville’s air was found to contain 14 micrograms of pollution per cubic meter — well below the federal standard of 100 micrograms per cubic meter. It was 
predicted that within 30 years, Gainesville may surpass federal 
levels due to future area traffic conditions and transportation facilities. However, road construction plans promised to re-duce traffic and lead to less air pollution.
Sept. 28, 1987: After receiving nearly $1 million prior to 1987, 
UF researchers working on President Reagan’s “Star Wars” de-fense plan requested another three-year grant to continue their research. Nuclear, mechanical and material engineers wanted 
more than the $900,000 they had already spent to continue re-
searching gas core reactors, which run on gas instead of solid fuel. They hoped to develop this technology to allow nuclear reactors to be used in space.
Sept. 25, 1992: UF’s Activity and Service Fee Committee 
voted to recommend a fee of $5.95 per credit hour to be ap-proved by UF President John Lombardi. This 30-cent fee hike was to provide full funding for the ‘93-’94 Big Eight budget. 
The Student Body president and treasurer tried to recommend 
a lower fee, saying that students should not be subjected to more taxes due to the state’s budget crunch.
Sept. 28, 2004: Southwest Recreation Center celebrated its 
10th year of operation with tours and a brief ceremony featur -
ing UF President Bernie Machen and Student Body President Jamal Sowell. The speakers forecasted the center’s future ex-pansion to about 160,000 square feet. This renovation was esti-
mated to cost about $22 million. They said the expanded center 
would include a pool, new all-purpose rooms and a cardio-fitness training area.

Ofﬁ  cers from the Gainesville

GPD helicopters and police dogs

Police said they believe Aguilar

� IT WILL BE ON THE STUDENT 
GOVERNMENT ELECTION BALLOT.
SAMANTHA SHAVELL
Alligator Staff Writer
The UF Supreme Court voted Friday that 
a referendum asking students if they want to 
rename the Reitz Union will appear on the Oc-tober Student Government elections ballot.
On the ﬁ  nal hearing for this referendum, 
the court approved it by striking the beginning sentences and only having the ﬁ  nal sentence — the question itself — on the ballot.
The referendum’s wording had been pre-
liminarily approved last month. Going into Friday’s hearing, it read, “J. Wayne Reitz, the namesake of the student union, was a univer-sity president who collaborated in purging gay students and professors from UF. His adminis-
tration also disregarded [U.S.] Supreme Court 
orders for racial integration at UF until 1958. Virgil Hawkins was denied entrance to UF in 1949 because of his race. Hawkins fought UF segregation in court for nine years. He won racial integration of UF graduate and profes-sional schools under the condition he would not be permitted entrance. Should the student union be renamed after Virgil Hawkins?”
At a previous hearing, Ariana Alfonso, a 
former supervisor of elections and current law student, asked the court to review the language of the referendum again. At Friday’s meeting, she was introduced as the solicitor general, representing the executive branch of SG.
Alfonso said the language as it stood mis-
led the students and slandered Reitz. She said the court should amend and review the refer-endum so the language is not biased.
Sen. Ford Dwyer, who authored the refer-
endum, said the school may have expanded under Reitz’s leadership, but his record is still scarred. Dwyer said all the information in his referendum was factual.
“This objection is the dissatisfaction of 
some regarding the court’s original decision, and now they want a redo,” he said.Associate Justice Alex Andrade, who was 
not present at the initial hearing, proposed denying the referendum as a whole and let-ting Dwyer come back next semester with a cleaned-up version to put on the ballot.
Andrade said the signatures collected were 
tainted because they were collected under 
wording that he did not ﬁ  nd proper.
But Associate Justice Tim 
Mason disagreed. He said that no matter the word-ing used in the referendum, Dwyer would have ex-
plained Hawkins’ achieve-ments and Reitz’s actions 
when conveying his mes-
sage to potential signers.
“I don’t think it would have made much of 
a difference,” Mason said.
But he agreed that the wording was biased 
and proposed removing the language that re-
ferred to Reitz.
Associate Justice Cole Sullivan proposed that only the question in the referendum re-main on the ballot. He said it would be abus-ing the court’s power to strike the referendum down as a whole.
“I do feel as far as policy goes, we need to 
have a better system in place,” Sullivan said.
The court ruled 5-2 that it will inform the 
supervisor of elections to place the last sen-tence of the referendum on the ballot.
Dwyer said he was expecting this result 
because people at the university don’t want students knowing this issue.
“I think they treated this speciﬁ  c referen-
dum unfairly and treated it differently than others in the past,” Dwyer said after the hear-ing.
But Dwyer said he still believes he will get 
a majority of voting students to vote “yes” on the ballot.
“I believe that I can and try my best to do 
so, despite the obstacles the court presented to me today,” he said after the hearing.

UF Supreme Court passes amended Reitz Union referendum
The election ofﬁ  ce contacted four people
on the secretary of state’s list of potential nonciti-
zens, considering she became a naturalized citizen 
and voted in 2008,” he said.
The list was crosschecked with data from the De-
partment of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles. 
It was reﬁ  ned to 2,600 people, and the names of 
the people in each county were sent to election su-
pervisors.
The elections ofﬁ  ce contacted the four people on 
the list and two sent proof of their citizenship, Car-penter said. One did not respond.
She said the person who was removed from the 
voting roll was not a citizen and said he didn’t know how his name got on the roll.
After a few more steps, including letters and a 
newspaper ad, the elections ofﬁ  ce decides whether or not to purge a person from the list.
The problem, Carpenter said, was that some of the motor vehicles department information was outdated. 
“It’s static information,” she said.
The state agreed to redo the way the list was gen-
erated. The potential purge list will now be cross-
checked with SAVE, a web-based federal data ser-
vice that helps determine immigration status.
Supervisors have not been sent a new list yet, 
Carpenter said.
On Sept. 19, a lawsuit was ﬁ  led in a South Flori-
da federal court challenging the voter purge.
In the afﬁ  davit, Smith said he believes the Florida 
Department of State did not act in accordance with 
its own protocol when generating the purge list.
Smith said he doesn’t think forcing thousands of 
citizens to provide proof of their citizenship justi-ﬁ  es the handful of noncitizen voters who might be purged.
Public relations and political science senior Alex 
Masi, 21-year-old co-chair of Gators for Obama, said the voter purge hasn’t had an affect on getting 
UF students ready for the November election.
“We’re still registering anyone that wants to 
vote,” he said.PURGE , from page 1

A crowd including fraternity 
brothers and alumni gathered 
Saturday at 10 Fraternity Row 
to celebrate the groundbreaking 
ceremony of the new Theta Chi house.
“I’ve never seen an empty lot 
look better than this,” Vice Presi-
dent for Student Affairs Dave 
Kratzer said when he addressed 
about 50 people dressed in orange and blue at the ceremony.
The groundbreaking event was 
a historic moment and day for UF and the fraternity brothers, he said.
After attendees posed for pho-
tos at the construction site, guests 
moved to Corry Village for a re-
ception.
Gator alumna Kim Wheeler at-
tended the ceremony with her two sons, who are Theta Chi brothers.
She said Greek life allows them to make lifelong friends and learn 
about UF’s history.
“The brotherhood takes the big 
campus and makes it more con-
centrated,” Wheeler said.
Dressed in a blue jacket and 
a polka-dot bow tie, 19-year-old Theta Chi brother Erich Krzyzak said the groundbreaking is an enormous deal.
“Everybody is excited,” he 
said. “These are the ﬁ  rst stages of a huge product.”
The accounting sophomore 
said the fraternity’s former house 
was built in 1916. The new house 
should be built by July 15.
“The other house was show-
ing its age,” Krzyzak said. “It was deﬁ  nitely more than time for a 
face-lift.”Theta Chi breaks ground

After a February fire de-
stroyed part of Satchel’s 
Pizza, owner Satchel Raye 
started a months-long project 
to redecorate. To continue the eclectic style the pizzeria is known for, Raye called upon 
local artists to bring their own 
flavors to the restaurant.
“Everything I do has a 
certain style, but I wanted to have a variety of artistic en-
ergy,” he said.
Marc Daniel, 26, is among 
the artists Raye asked to contribute. He’s currently 
creating a mural of abstract 
designs with attached wood 
pieces on one of the outside walls.
Daniel said Raye let him 
have artistic freedom but asked for “something kind of Aztec or tribal.”
For the past eight years, 
Daniel has worked with cut-
paper art, but he is working 
with wood for this project. He has been working since Sept. 17, he said, and the mural 
should be done this week.
Raye said he saw some of 
Daniel’s work on Facebook after meeting him at the piz-
zeria and contacted him about creating a piece for the restaurant.
Daniel said he’s never 
done a 3-D mural like the one he’s putting together at Satchel’s.
The mural is based off a 
previous piece Daniel made with cut paper but is differ -
ent because of its layers and about 80 wood pieces.
“I like to make new things, 
but sometimes revisiting something and making it new is good too,” Daniel said.
Daniel said he’s been 
working on making dog por -
traits and an animated music video as side projects.
“That’s how I’ve paid 
the rent the last couple of months,” he said.
Jason Raimondi, a 23-year-
old UF art and technology senior, is working as Daniel’s 
assistant.
“I thought this was awe-
some,” Raimondi said. “I 
think it’s really cool to go 
from cut paper to wood.”
In addition to helping put 
together the mural, Raimondi 
is recording the process of creating it for a video project.
Raye said he encourages 
artists to record their pro-cesses through pictures and videos. He said he can use 
that media on the restaurant’s 
website and Facebook to get the word out about the new developments.
The pizzeria is recognized 
for its eccentric collection of artwork, including a motor -
cycle made of recycled mate-rial and a giant metal spider. 
Raye said the restaurant’s col-
lection is about 60 percent his own art and about 40 percent from other artists.
“It’s just kind of a new 
idea I’ve put together to get local art and artists together,” Raye said. “We already have a handful of works by vari-
ous artists, so I’m going to 
keep doing this until I run out of space.”MONDAY, SEPTEMBER, 24, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 5

chua County?” asked Chapman, a 
17-year-old political science and inter -
national studies freshman.
Chapman is one of hundreds of stu-
dent volunteers from several organiza-
tions on campus working to register students for the upcoming November elections.
Pam Carpenter, Alachua County 
supervisor of elections, said about 
1,500 to 3,000 forms are received each 
week. Since the primary , there has been an increase of 5,172 voters in the county , which she said is largely due to student registration organizations.
About 8,300 of those forms have 
been registered through the Florida Democratic Party , which includes Gators for Obama. The organization 
has about 100 volunteers on-campus 
each week registering voters, said Christina Ford, Gators for Obama vot-ing registration director.
Austin Swink, 20, communications 
director for Gators for Romney , said the organization has about 30 volun-teers out at high-traffic areas on-cam-pus to register students.
Other third-party registration orga-
nizations on campus include Chomp the V ote, which is run by UF Student Government, and TurboVote.
The process starts on the streets.  
Volunteers spread out across campus to remind students to register before the Oct. 9 deadline. Then, the forms are collected by leaders and make their way to the county Supervisor of Elec-
tions office within 10 days.
For Gators for Obama, volunteers 
run from about 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. most 
days of the week, said Ford, a 20-year-old political science and economics sophomore.
At the end of the day , the forms are 
collected at the organizations’ head-quarters tables on campus and taken 
to the Organizing for America office 
at 315 SE Second Ave. around 9 p.m. The forms are logged by about seven Gators for Obama volunteers until about 2 a.m.
The forms are delivered to the 
County Supervisor of Elections office, then back to the state for verification. 
When the forms are cleared, the in-
formation is sent back to the Supervi-sor of Elections office.
“The process is tiring,” Chapman 
said. “But the people are pretty dedi-cated.”Student clubs responsible

University Police kept fans in check 
during the Gators’ 38-0 shutout against the 
University of Kentucky on Saturday.
UPD ejected 32 people from the UF-
Kentucky game at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium, 
nine of whom were UF students, according 
to a UPD news release.
No arrests were made but officers issued 
nine civil citations for alcohol possession.
Nine people were ejected for public in-
toxication, while five others were kicked out for smoking.
For the second game in a row, ejections and arrests were low compared to home games in previous years.
In last year’s second home game against 
the University of Alabama at Birmingham, police ejected 58 people, including one ar -
rest for disorderly conduct and one for tres-passing.
In 2010’s UF-Kentucky game, police 
ejected 63 people with 13 arrests, according to archived UPD gameday statistics. One of the people arrested was a UF student.
During that game, police charged 12 
people with alcohol possession and another individual with battery. Police also kicked out 14 people for disorderly conduct.
UF has a bye week Saturday and is 
scheduled to play Louisiana State Univer -
sity on Oct. 6 at home.

Depending on what news you were reading, Aug. 
27 might be a strong indicator as to whom you will vote for come November. The opening day of the 
Republican National Convention, President Barack Obama announced he finalized his plan to raise Corporate Average 
Fuel Efficiency to 54.5 mpg by 2025.
In the works since 2009, by the end of 2012, automakers 
are to have an average fleet fuel economy of 28.7 mpg; cur -
rently, they all are exceeding that standard at 28.9 mpg. Ve-
hicle gas emissions will drop an estimated 50 percent while reducing fuel consumption by approximately 40 percent by 2025. According to the White House, $1.7 trillion will be saved by families in gas costs alone and $8,000 through the lifetime of each vehicle. By 2016 the industry is planned to be 
up to an average of 35.5 mpg.
Obama, alongside all major automaker CEOs, stated in 
2011: “This agreement on fuel standards represents the single 
most important step we’ve ever taken as a nation to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. … The companies here today have endorsed our plan to continue increasing the mileage on their cars and trucks over the next 15 years.”
As Obama put it: “This agreement was arrived at with-
out legislation. You are all demonstrating what can happen 
when people put aside differences — these folks are competi-
tors, you’ve got labor and business, but they decided, we’re going to work together to achieve something important and lasting for the country.”
A nonprofit organization called Ceres was teamed up 
with Citi Investment Research to conduct a study to assess the economic implications of such a massive plan. The first thing that was noticed was that “higher standards mean higher profits.” It also found that Obama’s plan would lead 
to 484,000 new jobs in 49 states.
Walter McManus, research professor at Oakland Univer -
sity , analyzed the data. He found that by 2020, $2.44 billion 
will be brought into U.S. automakers because of increased standards and that all automakers will see an increase of $4.76 billion. He proclaimed all American automotive indus-tries will become more competitive internationally, which is important for our need to start selling more goods overseas.Those who claim the technology 
is not there are simply misinformed. Mitt Romney’s campaign represen-tative Andrea Saul said: “Gov. Rom-ney opposes the extreme standards 
that President Obama has imposed, 
which will limit the choices available to American families. 
… The president tells voters that his regulations will save them thousands of dollars at the pump but always forgets to mention that the savings will be wiped out by having to pay thousands of dollars more upfront for unproven technology that they may not even want.”
Alan Baum of Baum & Associates (a business that pro-
vides research and analysis for the automotive and related 
industries) says: “There is a whole variety of technology to 
meet the standard. … And the primary method will be the internal combustion engine. The automakers understand that, and they have technology to allow for that.” 
Dan Meszler of Meszler Engineering Services says that the 
cost of the automotive technologies would be outweighed heavily by the savings consumers make at the pump. 
“The break-even point is about $1.50 a gallon,” he says, 
according to his calculations. Which, in my opinion, we will 
never see again. He went on to say, “What [the Corporate 
Average Fuel Efficiency] does is floats all boats.”
Some might argue, myself included, that a 54.5 mpg aver -
age standard is unattainable in 15 years time. But that argu-ment is moot because any standard increase will be beneficial for this economy, all families and the environment.
Not only has Romney stated his disapproval of this plan, 
but he has stated he will do what he can to reverse it should he become president. The greatest thing you can do to help 
with this issue is either vote for a reelection of Obama or do 
what you can to convince Romney of the dangers of revers-ing the Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency plan.
Supporting not just Obama’s plan but this trend is incred-
ibly important — and after being informed of the facts and numbers, it becomes a no-brainer.

Why every state is 
important in this election
Rep. Todd Akin is still running for a Missouri Senate seat.
Still. He’s still running.The guy who said that a woman’s body can shut down 
a pregnancy from a “legitimate rape.”
That guy. And he feels like his campaign should be optimis-
tic about its future.
“I believe the state of the campaign is looking better and bet-
ter,” Akin said Friday after the first debate between him and Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill.
Not only has Akin continued to run despite his gaffe-to-end-
all-gaffes, but he has “repeatedly rejected calls of top national Republicans — including presidential candidate Mitt Romney — to quit the race so the state GOP committee can appoint a replacement candidate,” according to Fox News.
So many high-paying donors, like the Republican National 
Committee and the National Republican Senatorial Committee, have pulled funding from Akin’s campaign. He deserved all that funding to be pulled because no one should support some-one as stupid as Akin.
“If the Republicans are going to win control of the Senate, 
they need Missouri,” said Newt Gingrich, offering an explana-tion as to why he will be hosting a dinner to raise money for Akin.
That probably makes sense. If you need more Republican 
senators in order to pass your awful legislation, it shouldn’t mat-ter what name, face or ideals are attached to the party.
“It’s your choice,” Akin said during the debate with McCa-
skill, according to the Kansas City Star. “More freedom or more Washington.”
Well, Akin, we would like more freedom but basically not the 
kind you’re offering.
Jonathan Dine, the Libertarian candidate also present at the 
debate, offered his perspective.
“We do not need politicians telling us who we can love, what 
to do with our own money or what we can do with our own body,” Dine said.
It’s pretty easy to sound well-connected to voters when you’re 
standing next to Akin, a man who cannot seemingly grasp even a hint of understanding of how the female body works. We’re not asking for a genius here, people. We would just prefer our legislative body to know how actual bodies work.
“I was astonished to find that Akin sits on the science com-
mittee, yet he fails to understand basic eighth grade biology ,” Dine said in the debate, according to Talking Points Memo.
Maybe we’re assuming too much about what the American 
population looks for in its representatives.
“This election is going to be quite a contrast for Missourians,” 
McCaskill said in the debate.
Missouri appears to be like a cross section of the U.S. when it 
comes to viewpoints and opinions of people running for office. 
There are many to select from, should you choose to vote.
It’s scary to leave the election in anyone else’s hands but our 
own, especially if the person who wins has been abandoned by 
his own political party.

Letter to the Editor
To my fellow Gators,
As this semester comes to a midpoint, 
I wanted to take a moment to address the Student Body regarding the upcoming Fall elections. In the coming weeks, Student Body 
elections for senators will be taking place 
across campus. In Fall, 50 candidates are 
elected to represent the various living loca-
tions of all students. There are 13 residence hall areas that have senators elected to rep-resent their interests. There are also five dis-
tricts — District A, B, C, D and E — that rep-resent our students living off campus. Spring semester will see elections taking place for 
senators representing their academic col-
lege or year in school such as freshmen and 
sophomore.
As Senate President, I have had the op-
portunity to see the tremendous work that Student Government is able to accomplish on behalf of the students. SG has completed 
projects such as having Library West open 
24 hours a day five days a week and the in-troduction of cellphone charging stations on campus. SG also continues to champion 
student needs by advocating in Tallahassee 
and Washington, D.C. SG is able to do this 
through the support of the Student Body, 
and furthermore, through the elections of senators and others by students in general 
elections. It is the responsibility and duty of 
senators to accurately represent and cham-pion the needs, the services and the voice of 
students.
Because of this, I urge all students to be-
come informed about the upcoming elections for SG and to participate by voting on Oct. 2 and 3.
If you have any questions, the third floor 
of the Reitz Union is home to all SG offices 
and a wealth of information concerning SG. You can also visit the SG website at www.
sg.ufl.edu.
Take care, and go, Gators!
Logan Harrison
Senate president
Student Government
When I came to study in the United States a year 
ago, I never thought that I could be penalized for exercising my right to free speech on the 
campus of a public university . But a decision by the UF Supreme Court last Friday means that very thing could 
now happen to any one of us, and as a student senator, I 
want to make sure every UF student knows about it.
During the Summer while most of us were away, 
members of the majority Swamp Party — then the Unite 
Party — in your Student Senate made an absurd rule stat-ing that if anyone encourages you to vote for them in a Student Government election more than a week before the vote takes place, they could be disqualified from the 
ballot. Ridiculously, this means that for another week I 
cannot even let you know whether or not there’s an elec-
tion on Oct. 2 and 3.
Two weeks ago, I went to 
the student-run Court to ar -
gue that the Senate’s decision 
should be ruled as a violation of your First Amendment rights. There are clear provi-
sions in the Student Body Constitution and the election statutes saying that SG will respect the rights granted by federal and state law. The UF Supreme Court has even 
referred to federal or state cases in the past when making 
judgments. But despite all of that, the current Court decid-ed on Friday that it believes it does not have jurisdiction to decide how federal or state laws should be interpreted.
The effect of this decision is potentially chilling. It 
means that even if the Student Senate decided to make the most oppressive rules about elections, the Supreme Court has declared itself powerless to do anything. For example, if the majority in the Senate decides that it is forbidden to 
criticize the Unite Party — or now the Swamp Party — in 
any way, there is nothing the Court will do. Essentially they’re saying, “Sure, your right to free speech may well have been horribly violated. If you think that’s the case, go to a district court outside of UF because we can’t help you.” That’s all well and good, except that most students would have no idea of how to appeal to a district court and even if they did, it is prohibitively expensive. In any 
case, a district court might take years to hear the case or 
never hear it at all.
I believe that if the UF Supreme Court cannot or will 
not act as a mediator in cases where students’ rights are clearly violated, the system of checks and balances in our Student Government is fatally flawed, and students have no one else to defend their rights. So, we will be appealing this decision, first by asking the Court to seek advice from 
their law professors and the Florida Bar about whether 
the decision they reached last week was correct. Failing that, we will take this to the UF administration and, if necessary , beyond. Your right to speak freely on campus about who spends more than $17 million of your money every year is at stake – it really is that important.

Speaking OutAs an avid feminist and admirer of empowered wom-
en everywhere, I was thrilled when I found out Mi-chelle Obama was coming to speak at the Stephen C. 
O’Connell Center.
Once my friend Hannah told me the news, I got into my 
car and drove to campus.
For five hours, she and I took turns manning our spot in 
line. By the time I finally got our tickets, I was tired, hungry 
and drenched in sweat, but I still thought it was worth it.
Not even the parking ticket on my dashboard could 
bring me down.
On the day of the event, the two of us could hardly con-
tain our excitement.
As we were getting closer to the entrance, one of the staff 
members came up and asked if we were in a group.
“It’s just us,” I said.  
She asked if “us” included the man who was next to Han-
nah. I clarified that it didn’t and, seemingly satisfied with the answer, she placed green stickers on our tickets.
We assumed it was a way to keep track of students, so we 
proceeded toward the security checkpoint.
As it turns out, the stickers allowed us to enter the arena 
without having to go up the stairs like everyone else. The fast passes led us to incredible seats about 15 feet from the lectern.
While Hannah read a textbook, I noticed the juxtaposi-
tion of the cameras and the people who were sitting next to us.  
That’s when it hit me — I had waited seven hours to be 
used as a human prop.
The four rows had an unusually large number of His-
panic, black and Asian students. There were sprinkles of white people in the group, but minorities took up most of the space.
Granted, we were all there because we wanted to hear 
the speech, but by putting us all in the “glamour shot,” they basically racially profiled us into our seats.
When I pointed out my theory , 
one of the guys behind us joked, “Yes! We made it.”
Nobody else seemed too both-
ered by the fact that we might have been chosen to sit there to showcase diversity.
The possibility of a prepackaged audience didn’t sit well 
with me.
It might be naïve of me to be surprised by the diversity 
roundup in a political event, but I still felt used. Despite lov-
ing the speech, I was left a bit perplexed by the situation.
The use of minorities to polish political images in a col-
lege setting highlights a larger problem: the exploitation of 
specific groups to push entire campaign agendas.
When candidates attend rallies for specific minority 
groups, the issues are labeled as pertinent to them. One ex-ample is Mitt Romney’s “Meet the Candidate” event on Wednesday.
He spoke about the issues that affect Latino voters, which 
apparently include immigration, education and foreign pol-
icy . Last I heard, many of us were more concerned with the 
economy, but since I was born in South America, I guess that isn’t as relevant.
Yeah, right.How comical would it be if candidates also held rallies 
that focused on white voters?
I would love to see the advertising. Maybe then my less 
diverse friends could get prime speech seating, too.
All jokes aside, I really hope candidates stop using mi-
nority groups to gain popularity . By addressing the nation as one and not as separate racial or ethnic cliques, candi-dates could unify their constituency, and they could prevent future students from feeling like chess pawns.

Luke, a 27-year-old Asian elephant, paints a picture for the audi-
ence at Two Tails Ranch, located in Williston on Saturday.
COURTNEY LINDWALL
Alligator Contributing Writer
A 12-ton artist sauntered to 
his canvas.
He took the paintbrush from 
his trainer, curled his trunk 
around the brush and began to paint.
Luke, a 27-year-old Asian ele-
phant, painted a picture splashed with orange and blue.
He is one of four elephants at 
Two Tails Ranch in Williston and was the star at Elephant Appre-
ciation Day on Saturday.
“He just likes to do it. He gets 
all jittery,” said Patricia Zerbini, 
elephant expert and owner of 
Two Tails Ranch.
About 750 people attended 
the event, which the ranch plans 
to make annual. 
It was a way to raise money 
for supplies — like for the 300 pounds of food each elephant consumes daily.
Pony rides kicked up dust 
near the parking area, the three-man band played renditions of 
Tom Petty songs and a line of 30 people waited to feed carrots to 
the elephant Roxy for $2. 
And of course, crowds piled 
in to see Luke and his abstract 
art.
Luke paints almost every day.
He paints between baths, 
walks through the woods and feeding time, Zerbini said.
His paintings sell at the 
ranch’s gift shop for $15 to $100.
Kaitlin Sovich, 22-year-old 
anthropology and sociology se-
nior at UF, decided to skip the 
University of Kentucky football game to come see the elephants instead.
“It’s cool to get out and see 
something exotic and different,” Sovich said.  “I’d rather be here than sweating and screaming at the game.”
The ranch is home to other 
animals, as well.
Near the back, two zebras 
munched on hay, an ostrich pa-trolled its pen’s fence and a duck 
roamed near food vendors.
Ginny Somers, a 21-year-old 
biology senior, volunteers at the ranch regularly and ran the gift 
shop register for Elephant Ap-
preciation Day. 
Somers is a member of the 
Pre-Vet Club at UF, which has 
a history of coming out to Two 
Tails to tour and help out.
“My first day, we did every-
thing we could possibly do at the 
ranch,” Somers said.
She said her duties included 
cleaning out the barns, carrying more than 100 bales of hay and scrubbing down the rough leath-er of the elephants.
“The skin is like rocks. It made 
my knuckles bleed,” said Som-ers, who hopes to one day work in an exotic animal clinic. 
In her year helping out at 
the ranch, she has been amazed by Zerbini’s skill with the el-ephants.
“There’s nobody in this coun-
try who can train elephants like she does,” Somers said.
Zerbini said when she started 
to train Luke, it was obvious from the beginning that he loved 
to paint.
“I try to pull out from my el-
ephants what they enjoy doing,” 
she said.Elephant artist star of appreciation day

UF agreed to partner with online learning 
program Coursera last week, joining 32 other 
institutions in offering not-for-credit courses for free.
The online program works to bring top 
universities together to educate students worldwide. Currently, the UF courses listed on Coursera’s website include Economic Is-sues Food & You; Fundamentals of Human Nutrition; Global Health Cultures; Global Sustainable Energy: Past, Present and Future; How Music Works; and Sustainable Agricul-
tural/Urban Land Management. None of the 
UF courses’ start dates have been announced.
Users only need to enter a name and valid 
email address to sign up.
Andy McCollough, associate provost for 
teaching and technology at UF, got the uni-versity involved with Coursera. He said the program is different from others because it “makes it possible to design a path for each 
person.”
Instead of 50-minute taped lectures, Cours-
era has taken the material and split it into 10- 
to 15-minute segments with interactive quiz-zes at the end to personalize online learning, he said.
UF spokesman Steve Orlando said he 
thought the program’s goal for worldwide education was a good thing.
“It’s a different world in higher education 
now, and the roles are changing,” he said. “The 
way we are offering courses is changing, too. 
UF is always very advanced when it comes to online education, and it just makes sense for us to be a part of it.”
Although the classes are free, there’s a 
catch: They do not count for credit.
Jessica Orenstein, a 20-year-old sociology 
junior, has taken three online classes while at 
UF. She said if the Coursera classes counted toward her degree, she would think about tak-
ing one.
A student will be issued a certificate upon 
completion of a course, which does not replace a course taken at an accredited institution, ac-cording to Coursera’s Terms of Use. 
The terms also state that instructors and 
participating institutions will not be involved in any attempts to get the course recognized for credit.
But that doesn’t mean the material isn’t 
valuable for resume building.
“It seems to me, if I was a potential employ-
er, it would tell me … here’s a person who is self-motivated to learn more,” McCollough 
said. Free, not-for-credit classes now offered to UF students onlineCARA CHIARAMONTE

The Career Resource Center will begin its 
first social media workshop series today at 4 
p.m. in its classroom on the first floor of the Reitz Union.
Career Development Coordinator Jill 
Skufe said attendees will learn ways to net-work and portray themselves online in a positive light. Networking is the number one 
way to find a job, she said.
“Social media has opened doors that 
didn’t exist before,” Skufe said. “Students 
don’t think to take advantage of it.”
The series will consist of three workshops. 
The first will focus on online branding.
Skufe said 92 percent of recruiters screen 
social media when looking for potential em-ployees.
The current generation of students in col-
lege has grown up with social media on only a personal level, she said.“They don’t know yet how the profes-
sional world is using it,” Skufe said. “It’s dif-ferent.”
Kiersten Sigmond, a 21-year-old telecom-
munication junior, said she deactivated her Facebook account after a friend was fired for posting a picture with a beer in her hand.
“When you have a Facebook, you’re re-
sponsible for what other people post,” she said. “They may blur out their drink, but you still know it’s alcohol.”
Sigmond said the workshop could help 
teach her how to professionally promote her -
self.
“Most of the business world is online,” she 
said. “It’s important to put yourself out there in a respectable manner.”CRC offers social media class

Handmade signs reading “Gators Par -
ty Right,” “Let’s Get Fiscal” and “Hope 
and Change Isn’t Hiring” lined the walls of the Weil Hall room where Josh Romney spoke Friday.
Josh Romney , the third-oldest son of 
Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, spoke to a crowd of about 170.
Romney said his father is running be-
cause he thinks he can turn the economy around. 
The 37-year-old touched on adjust-
ments, like changes to Medicare and health care, that his father would make to 
help bring the country out of debt.
“We cannot afford four more years 
of President Obama,” Romney told the 
crowd.
Romney said that many of his father’s supporters are people who were caught up in the hype for President Barack Obama four years ago.
“The mood is really good,” Romney 
said. “We’re gonna win in Florida.”
The crowd buzzed with cheers as Rom-
ney urged people to 
vote and to volunteer for the cause.
“We need you guys 
to fight hard for us,” Romney said.
Romney ended his 
speech by jokingly in-
viting everyone who at-
tended the event to his 
father’s presidential inauguration ball.
Chemical engineering freshman James 
Fong, 18, attended the event because he wanted to hear about Mitt Romney’s plans.

will do,” Fong said.Josh Romney speaks to

The corner of University 
Avenue and Gale Lemerand 
Drive sizzled with Repub-lican star power Saturday when U.S. Senate candidate 
Connie Mack and Josh Rom-
ney, presidential candidate Mitt Romney’s son, tailgated with students and alumni.
About 50 people milled 
around a green portable tent, eating barbecue ribs and Krispy Kreme doughnuts and posing for photos with Mack 
and Romney.
Mack was elected to the 
U.S. House of Representatives 
in 2004 to represent Florida’s 14th Congressional District, according to his page on the House website. He serves on the Foreign Affairs, and Oversight and Government 
Reform committees.
Romney’s appearance was 
a surprise but “an added bo-
nus” after he rallied students for his father’s presidential campaign Friday on campus, said music and political sci-ence junior Collin Thompson, co-chair of the statewide co-
alition Students for Mack.
“I thought he was leaving 
after his speaking engage-
ment yesterday,” the 20-year-old said.
Skylar Zander, 21, said he 
enjoyed spending time with Romney in the casual envi-ronment.
“He’s down-to-earth,” Zander said. 
Thompson said the tailgate 
was the first stop on Mack’s statewide campaign bus tour. 
“I can’t think of a better 
way to kick off a statewide bus tour than to start with 
your roots,” Thompson said.
Mack, who graduated from 
UF in 1993, said Gainesville 
doesn’t seem to have changed much since he was a student.
“It feels the same,” said 
Mack, who wore a white col-lared shirt adorned with the 
Gator logo. 
“I think the 
football pro-gram has 
been more successful.”
A f t e r   
lunch, vol-unteers as-s e m b l e d 
yard signs for Mack and the Mitt Romney campaign, passed out stickers and sold “Gators for Romney” T-shirts.
Thompson said Mack’s 
visit holds significance for students because Mack aims to reduce government spend-
ing to lessen the amount of 
national debt the next genera-tion will be responsible for. 
He said the current na-
tional debt divided per capita equals more than $50,000 dol-lars.
“You think you’re going to 
graduate debt-free, but you 
graduate with $52,000 over -
head,” Thompson said.Romney, Mack join

complex parking lot with his shorts unzipped and genitals exposed.
Police charged Shashi Prakash with indecent ex-
posure Friday when a GPD officer found him in an Enclave Apartments parking lot, according to a GPD arrest report.
At about 6:30 a.m., Megan Oftedal left her apart-
ment to go to work. When she got downstairs, Prakash, 29, of Newark, Del., approached her with his pants unzipped and without any underwear.
Oftedal, 22, said Prakash “didn’t seem with it at 
all” and that he asked her several times where to 
find a certain apartment.
Prakash followed Oftedal into the parking lot un-til she locked herself in her car to call 911.
When GPD arrived at the parking lot, Prakash 
walked away from Oftedal’s car and toward another 
row of cars.
The officer ordered Prakash back 
for questioning and asked him sev-eral times to zip his pants.
Prakash told the officer that 
he went to a club with a woman Thursday night  and woke up in 
the backseat of his car, the report 
stated.
Prakash could not give a reason 
why his pants were undone or why 
his genitals were exposed.
Police arrested Prakash and booked him into 
Alachua County Jail at 7:18 a.m. Friday. He was re-
leased later that day.

Quarterback Jeff Driskel runs down the sideline after escaping the pass rush in UF’s 38-0 win against Kentucky on Saturday in The Swamp.
GREG LUCA
Alligator Staff Writer
For quarterback Jeff Driskel, 
Saturday’s inconsistent perfor-
mance was another point on the 
learning curve. 
Driskel set career highs with 
18 completions and 27 attempts, 
amassing 203 yards with a touch-
down and an interception in Flor-
ida’s 38-0 romp of Kentucky. 
“Every game is really a build-
ing block,” Driskel said. “The more experience, the more reps 
you get, the more you’re going 
to learn. I did some nice things today, but there’s deﬁ  nitely some things that I’m going to have to 
clean up.”
Driskel was prone to over-
throws and misreads on Satur-
day, but he also made several pinpoint passes. 
In the second quarter, Driskel 
found Quinton Dunbar on a post pattern for a 19-yard touchdown. 
He set up the score with a 25-
yard pass that hit tight end Jordan Reed in stride down the seam. 
Driskel created passing op-
portunities by extending plays with his legs. 
With UF up 24-0 and driving in 
the third quarter, Driskel looked left, rolled right and absorbed a hit as he threw back across the 
middle of the ﬁ  eld to running 
back Mack Brown. 
The 5-yard gain moved Flori-
da to Kentucky’s 7-yard line. 
“Fantastic,” coach Will Mus-
champ said of Driskel’s pass. “He made some really nice throws.”
Driskel said his ability to 
scramble and get outside of the 
pocket came instinctually. Only 
once did the Gators call a pass designed to get Driskel on the move.  
His mobility was also a factor 
in the run game. He carried eight times for 35 yards, including a 1-yard touchdown on a sneak in 
the third quarter.  
After Florida’s offense opened 
with a pair of three-and-outs, 
Driskel kept the ball on a read-option play and sprinted 38 yards down the right sideline.
Muschamp said the big gain 
was the play that sparked Flori-da’s offense following the slow start. “He keeps so much alive,” 
Muschamp said. “There’s so 
many things he brings to the ta-
ble for us because of his athletic ability.”
Between the impressive plays, 
Driskel made the type of mistakes 
that might be expected from a 
quarterback in only his fourth ca-reer start. 
In the second quarter, Driskel 
threw his ﬁ  rst interception of the season on a deep pass intended for Latroy Pittman. 
“I just tried to force something 
that wasn’t there,” Driskel said. 
“I got too greedy and didn’t take 
what the defense gave me.”
Driskel also admitted to lock-
ing into his ﬁ  rst read and some-
times scrambling from the pocket 
too early. 
On consecutive plays in the 
second quarter, Driskel threw too high for Reed down the seam and 
then forced a pass to a double-
covered Frankie Hammond Jr. in the end zone, not noticing that Reed was uncovered in the cor-
ner. 
“We had some stuff open 
down the ﬁ  eld and did not hit it,” 
Muschamp said. 
Driskel cited a missed oppor-
tunity in the third quarter. 
On ﬁ  rst down from Kentucky’s 
46, Reed ran uncontested down the middle of the ﬁ  eld. Driskel’s development continues in uneven performance

  When the Florida offense took the 
ﬁ  eld against Kentucky on Saturday, it 
did so without the Gator who has had 
the most success against the Wildcats: junior Trey Burton.
  Coach Will Muschamp said fol-
lowing UF’s 38-0 win that Burton began suffering from back spasms on 
Friday morning, and the training staff 
could not resolve the issue in time for him to play.
  “We did everything we could,” 
Muschamp said. “Every time he planted on his right foot, he had pain shooting up his right hip. That’s all it was.”
  Burton, who was not on the side-
lines during the game, scored six touchdowns against the Wildcats as a freshman and scored one more dur-
ing Florida’s 48-10 win in 
Lexington, Ky., 
last season. In 
Florida’s win against Tennessee last 
week, Burton scored two touchdowns 
and gained 129 yards on just ﬁ  ve touches
  Muschamp said it was not the ﬁ  rst 
time Burton had been bothered by Burton misses Saturday’s 
game with back spasms FIRE JOE MORGAN
  Florida defeated Ken-
tucky for the 26th straight time on Satur-
day. The last time the Wild-cats beat the Gators, UF 
coach Will Muschamp was 
15 years old.
  When Florida plays Van-
derbilt on Oct. 13, the Gators will likely extend their win-ning streak against the Com-modores to 22 games.
  The Southeastern Confer-
ence has claimed the last six BCS Champions. But once 
you get past the eight top 
dogs, there is not much to offer.
  If the SEC truly wants 
to make its claim as the su-preme football conference in the nation, it needs to make changes. It’s time to kick some of these schools to the curb.
  I’m not saying schools 
need to be removed from the conference entirely. But when it comes to foot-ball, some teams are over-matched.
  Eight schools — Ala-
bama, Arkansas, Auburn, Florida, Georgia, LSU, South Carolina and Tennessee — 
have SEC-caliber football 
programs and have earned permanent status. Each boasts either an appropriate amount of current success or enough past triumphs to compensate for recent strug-gles.
  Kentucky, Mississippi 
State, Ole Miss and Vander-bilt are the odd schools out when it comes to football. Texas A&M and Missouri must abide by the replace-ment school rules listed be-low:  
  1. The school must be 
located in a state belonging to the former Confederate States of America. Sorry, West Virginia.
  2. The school must have 
a Chick-ﬁ  l-A on campus — end of discussion. 
  3. A replacement school

4. When you’re out of SEC 
football, you’re out. Re-entry is forbidden. Period.
5. You have five years to 
prove your worth. Back-to-back seasons with a confer -
ence record above .500 earns an additional year. Division titles earn three additional years, and SEC champion-ships earn five additional years. Once you accumulate 
10 additional years, perma-
nent football status is award-ed and all-sports member -
ship is  considered.
With the guidelines out of 
the way, here is the reason-ing for each school receiving football expulsion, plus a po-tential replacement.
Kentucky
In Lexington, Ky., basket-
ball is king and football is a 
drag.
Wildcats fans camp out to 
buy tickets for Big Blue Mad-ness — a midnight basket-ball practice. Tickets sold out 
in 35 minutes this year.
Meanwhile, Kentucky’s 
average football attendance 
has decreased by nearly 10,000 fans — a 14 percent drop — from 2009 to 2011.
Since 2002, UK is 23-57 in 
SEC play with two last-place finishes.
The Wildcats are a no-
brainer for football removal, and if not for their elite bas-ketball program, a serious candidate for permanent ex-pulsion.
Replacement Candidate: 
North Carolina — Granted, UNC is also primarily a basket-
ball school, and the Tar Heels 
are at home in the Atlantic Coast Conference. But with offensive genius Larry Fedora leading the program, it would be interesting.
Vanderbilt
Vandy has finished with 
a winning percentage better 
than .500 once since 1982. The Commodores have 16 winless seasons in SEC play. It’s time.
From an academic stand-
point, Vanderbilt helps raise the SEC’s profile quite a bit. Also, the Commodores 
would continue to com-
pete in baseball and men’s basketball — two sports in which they have enjoyed great success while playing in the SEC.
And don’t forget women’s 
bowling — 2007 national champions!
It’s difficult to dismiss 
coach James Franklin’s op-timistic vision for the pro-gram, but when you’re the homecoming opponent for half the teams on your sched-ule, the SEC moniker is not for you.
Replacement Candidate: 
Louisville — The Cardinals boast a respectable history, and they are trending up under 
coach Charlie Strong. 
Ole Miss
There are few places bet-
ter than The Grove on a col-
lege football Saturday, but unless the Rebels have a Manning under center, they are irrelevant.
Their only SEC win in the 
last two seasons was against Kentucky. Ouch.
The Ole Miss football pro-
gram is moving at the pace of its on-campus speed limit — 18 miles per hour, to honor Archie.
The Rebels last won an 
SEC title in 1963. Since then, Ole Miss has one SEC West championship, which they shared with LSU in 2003. The Tigers won the tiebreaker.
When you hire Hugh 
Freeze as your new coach, it’s a sign you’ve given up.
Replacement  Candidate: 
Clemson — The Gamecocks would likely block the move, but the Tigers bring the atmo-sphere of an SEC program, and Dabo Swinney has Clemson po-sitioned as a perennial Top-25 power. 
Mississippi State
The Bulldogs have won 
one conference champion-
ship since joining the SEC as a founding member in 1933. They won it in 1941.
Coach Dan Mullen has 
gotten the ball rolling in Starkville, Miss., in the last two seasons by notching 
back-to-back bowl victories 
and two NFL first-round draft picks.
However, until an early-
season win against Auburn in 2012, Mississippi State had not won a game against an SEC West opponent other than Ole Miss since 2008.
Ending the season with 
seven or eight victories is nice, but if you’re a non-factor in the divisional race, then what’s the point?
Replacement Candidate: Vir-
ginia Tech — The Hokies would fill the maroon void left by the Bulldogs and add a program 
with rich tradition and a pas-
sionate fan base. Coach Frank Beamer has won seven confer-ence titles and coached in six BCS bowls at Virginia Tech.
My suggested changes 
may seem radical — per -
haps even unreasonable. Do 
I foresee a  system like this 
ever seeing the light of day? Probably not.
But something should 
be done to make the SEC more competitive. To some, the league may seem tough enough already. 
However, in the so-called 
toughest conference in col-lege football, there should be no automatic victories. It’s time to shake things up.

After scrambling to avoid 
pressure, Driskel noticed his 
open tight end but underthrew 
him, giving the Kentucky defense 
time to recover and break up the pass. 
“I kind of floated it to him 
instead of putting it on him,” Driskel said. “Definitely left some points out there.” 
Still, Driskel said he feels the 
game “slowing down,” and Ham-mond notices the same. 
Driskel said he wants to release 
the ball faster against the rush, 
make the correct reads based on 
given coverages and improve other “small things” that go with the position. 
An uneven performance like 
Saturday’s is a natural step on the way. 
“The throwing game is going 
to continue to come,” Muschamp 
said. 
“We’re going to have our 
speed bumps. That’s part of the 
process with a young quarter -
back.”

Sophomore quarterback Jeff Driskel attempts a pass against Kentucky 
during UF’s 38-0 win on Saturday at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium.
Game ‘slowing down’ for sophomoreback spasms.
“I believe there was a game that 
came up, and there was a lot of 
question marks whether he would be able to go,” Muschamp said. 
Muschamp said losing Burton 
is a blow to the offense and the punt coverage unit. 
“As much as Trey does for us, 
it’s tough,” Muschamp said. “I’ve got to walk down to [special teams 
coach D.J.] Durkin’s office and tell 
him, and he’s under the desk. [Bur -
ton] does so much for us on special 
teams.”
Other injuries: Defensive tackle 
Sharrif Floyd left Saturday’s game 
at the end of the second quarter with what Muschamp described as 
a “stinger” on his shoulder.
“Everything should be fine,” 
Muschamp said.
Tight end Jordan Reed made 
one of the most memorable plays 
of the day on the Gators’ final 
touchdown drive of the first half, 
but it also cost him a shoulder in-jury of his own. He held onto a 25-
yard pass from Jeff Driskel despite 
losing his helmet  when Wildcats safeties Mikie Benton and Ashely 
Lowery sandwiched him. Benton 
received a personal foul on the play for targeting a defenseless re-
ceiver. 
“Reed got dinged up on his 
shoulder,” Muschamp said. “[He] 
came out third quarter and tried to 
go and just didn’t feel like he could 
get his hand up and get the range of motion.”
The Gators were without right tackle Chaz Green for the second 
straight game as he remained 
hobbled by a left ankle injury he suffered on Sept. 8 against Texas 
A&M.
Muschamp said during the 
week that Green was probable for Saturday, but the training staff de-
cided that he could not play after evaluating him prior to the game.
Defensive end Dominique Ea-
sley also missed Saturday’s game due to swelling in his left knee. 
“We just didn’t feel like he was 
good,” Muschamp said. 
Easley suffered an ACL tear on 
Nov. 26 against Florida State, but played in each of Florida’s first three games this season.
Brissett sees the field: When the 
Gators took over possession with 
a 31-0 lead and 11:57 remaining in the game, Will Muschamp de-cided to give Driskel a rest and 
put in backup Jacoby Brissett. In two drives, Brissett did not throw 
a pass, but he ran twice for 4 yards 
on his first drive, including a 1-yard touchdown on a sneak.
“We had the game in hand, and 
we felt very comfortable about that,” Muschamp said. “Jacoby 
Brissett deserves the opportunity 
to play, no different than any other position.”
Speculation abounds that Flor -
ida might redshirt Brissett to put a year of separation between him 
and Driskel. Players remain eli-
gible for a medical redshirt if they don’t play after the sixth game of 
the season or play in more than 
four games.

Without midfielder Erika Tymrak, UF’s 
premier scoring threat, the Gators put on their 
strongest offensive display this season. 
Entering the match, Tymrak led the team in 
shots, tied for the team lead in points and tied for second in goals.
Despite her absence due to a left ankle sprain 
suffered on Friday, Florida defeated Georgia (5-5-1, 1-2-1 Southeastern Conference) 4-1 on Sun-day in Gainesville.
“Obviously, losing Erika for a game, or how-
ever many games she’s out, is a big loss,” coach Becky Burleigh said on Sunday. “It’s a chance for someone to step up and get some experience and get more minutes than they might have had she been playing.”
The Gators (6-3-1, 3-1 SEC) struggled to fin-
ish runs in the first half. Through 45 minutes, they outshot the Bulldogs 8-2 but did not con-vert on any of those chances.
Junior Adriana Leon had several early op-
portunities for Florida. In the first 27 minutes, she took three shots. Her third shot came after sophomore midfielder Havana Solaun fired a shot from the far side that ricocheted off Geor -
gia goalkeeper Ashley Baker’s hands. Leon’s shot came in low, and Baker smothered it to prevent a  goal.
Junior midfielder Caroline Triglia also had a 
chance to score in the 41st minute. Triglia got the ball off a Bulldogs turnover, made her way around a defender and took a shot from outside the box that hit off the crossbar.
“At halftime, we came in and just said, 
‘We’re owning them, and we just have to put them away,’” Tymrak said. 
In the second half, the Gators put four away.The scoring frenzy began less than 10 min-utes into the half when senior midfielder Holly King, who landed hard after Georgia commit-ted a foul just minutes earlier, turned a corner kick from sophomore Annie Speese into Flori-da’s first goal.
“My run was going to be center, but I saw 
that the ball was going further,” King said. “I saw the goalkeeper was on near post, so I just headed it far post.”
The second goal came 10 minutes later off the 
foot of Solaun. Junior defender Maggie Rodgers fed Solaun the ball after fighting for it in front of goal, and Solaun booted it into the far corner for the Gators’ second goal.
The goal was Solaun’s third of the season 
and gave her the team lead in points.
The third goal of the 
game came from a less likely source.
After a handball in the 
box in the 69th minute, midfielder Jo Dragotta lined up to take a penalty kick. She shot toward the far post, the goalie dove toward the near 
post and the ball rolled into the net for the se-
nior’s first career goal.
The Gators added the fourth and final goal in 
the 79th minute, when sophomore forward Jil-
lian Graff ‘s shot bounced down off the crossbar 
and landed past the line. 
The assist went to freshman defender Brooke 
Smith, who recorded the first point of her col-
lege career.
This win gave the Gators their third straight 
victory and puts them in a tie for second in the 
SEC East standings.
“It’s a really big win for us,” Burleigh said. 
“The difference is, on Friday night we were at 
2-0 … but we let them back in it. Tonight, it’s 2-0 and we just kept pouring it on, and I think that’s important to see.”

The Gators may have won the first two sets 
over the Tigers on Friday, but the start wasn’t 
their best.
In Florida’s Southeastern Conference home 
opener this weekend, the Gators won the first set by three points and the second set by two. How-ever, No. 13 UF (9-2, 3-0 SEC) took advantage of 
intermission and came out strong in the third set 
to sweep Missouri (10-3, 2-1 SEC) 3-0 (25-22, 26-24, 25-17).
“I wouldn’t say either team was particularly 
sharp,” coach Mary Wise said. “It was like two 
basketball teams going fast break, fast break and 
just not hitting some shots. Missouri blocked ev-erything we hit at them. I credit their defense and how well they played.” 
Missouri posed a threat by out-blocking Florida 
12.5-7 before the intermission, keeping the Gators hitting to .167.
After the Gators jumped out to a 6-1 lead in the 
first set, they allowed the Tigers to fight their way 
back and eventually tie it up. The close battle con-
tinued into the second set, when Missouri pushed UF to extra points before falling 26-24. 
Despite the tight start, Florida had a more dom-
inate presence in the third set thanks to a change in its game plan.
“We really wanted to stress setting from pin 
to pin, meaning don’t force the middle, set over the top and get the balls over to our left side and 
right side,” Wise said. “Then we could go back to 
the middles and that’s what happened, with Chloe (Mann)’s last kill. It’s difficult to defend the entire net. We felt like we could take advantage of it and we finally did in the third set.”
Florida’s defense shined after the intermission.  Mann blocked a shot, and Taylor Brauneis and 
Betsy Smith combined for another. 
The change also carried over to the Gators’ of-
fense.
In the final set, outside hitter Ziva Recek and 
middle blocker Mann led Florida. The duo ac-
counted for 65 percent of the team’s 17 kills. The 
Gators out hit the Tigers .412 to .200 and only had three attack errors against 17 kills to end the match.
“I felt that if we could control the first contact 
and make some good hitting decisions there were kills to be had,” Wise said. “That was the differ -
ence in the third set.” 
Although Florida improved on both sides of the 
court, Brauneis credits the team’s ability to break through Missouri’s front line as its key improve-ment on Friday.
“At the end of the match, it was kind of just, 
‘Put the ball in play, let them play defense,’” Brau-
neis said. “That’s what our goal was just coming 
in the third game. Start hitting over the block if we could. It turned out good for us at the end.”

Watkins recorded his 
first career touchdown and interception on the same play, taking 
advantage of a poor pass by Kentucky quarterback Morgan Newton. Watkins’ pick put Florida up 17-0 in the second quarter.
After UF’s offense opened with a pair of three-and-outs, Jeff Driskel picked up 38 yards when 
he ran right on a read-open keep. Coach Will Muschamp said the play sparked UF’s offense, setting up a field goal that gave Florida the only points it would need.33.3
Quarterback Morgan Newton completed just 
33.3 percent of his passes and threw three 
interceptions, consistently derailing UK’s 
offense and giving Florida prime field position.KEY STAT

With an early 10-0 lead, Florida 
cornerback Jaylen Watkins picked off Kentucky quarterback Morgan Newton and took it to the house. It was Watkins’ first career intercep-
tion and touchdown.
Wide receiver Quinton Dunbar 
capped the Gators’ longest drive of the day — 76 yards — with a 19-yard touchdown catch, which gave Florida a 24-0 advantage right before 
halftime. The touchdown matched the 24-point spread before the first 30 minutes expired. UK threatened to advance into UF ter-ritory on a second consecutive drive in the second quarter, but Florida safety De’Ante Saunders snuffed out hope for Kentucky by intercepting a Newton 
pass right before it hit the ground.Florida intercepted Kentucky backup quarterback three times
sive line has allowed Florida to drop into coverage and 
force more turnovers.
With three interceptions against Kentucky, Florida in-
creased its turnover margin for the season to plus-5. The Gators finished last season at minus-12. Florida generated three or more turnovers only once in 2011.
The coaches made sure the lack of takeaways didn’t 
carry over to 2012. They placed an emphasis on it during the offseason.
“Eventually you get tired of it, and you want to do 
something about it,” linebacker Mike Taylor said. “We got tired of it.”
Kentucky’s starting quarterback, Maxwell Smith, 
missed the game due to a shoulder injury. He entered as the SEC’s leading passer. 
Senior Morgan Newton started in his place and went 
7 for 21 for 48 yards with three interceptions. He com-pleted only 33 percent of his passes — the lowest against the Gators all season. 
Running back Mike Gillislee scored Florida’s first 
touchdown on a 1-yard run with 12 minutes left in the 
second quarter, pushing UF’s lead to 10 points.
Then Newton became a consistent source of offense for Florida.
Three second quarter interceptions turned into seven 
Florida points. 
Junior Jaylen Watkins slid under a route, intercepted 
the pass and took the ball 26 yards for the first touchdown and interception of his UF career.  
“We went over this before the game,” Watkins said. “I 
watched the film at home. The guy’s running a stack for -
mation, and I knew it was coming.”
Florida faced Newton last season in Lexington and 
forced three turnovers.
“We just read his eyes,” Taylor said. “He went through 
his progressions and as he was going through his progres-
sion, we were reading him.”
Kentucky outgained Florida by 12 yards in the first 
quarter, but the Gators’ offense found a groove. Methodi-cal drives led by quarterback Jeff Driskel kept UF’s de-fense fresh on the sidelines.Florida converted 12 of 17 third-down opportunities 
and held a 15-minute advantage in time of possession.  
Driskel engineered a season best 15-play, 72-yard drive 
that lasted nine minutes in the third quarter.
“We were running the ball hard and we were convert-
ing on third down,” Driskel said. “That was a big thing coming into this week. 
“We did a real nice job of protecting and getting open 
and making the plays. That was good for our offense and good for our team.”
Florida moved up three spots to No. 11 in the AP Poll 
following the victory. 
The Gators have displayed the toughness the coaches 
have been looking for in each of their three conference 
wins. 
With a new starting quarterback and another year ad-
justing to Muschamp’s style, there is a sense of optimism 
surrounding the Gators.
“It’s definitely a little bit different this year,” Driskel 
said. 
“We’ve played three SEC teams already, and that’s 
huge. Going 3-0 in the SEC to start the year, and with us, we’re not done yet. We’re going to keep working hard 
and keep playing hard.”
