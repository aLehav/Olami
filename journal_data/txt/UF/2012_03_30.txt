IN MEMORIAM

Bill Luttge never introduced 
himself with his accomplishments, 
though he had enough to ﬁ  ll a con-
versation.
At UF, he was Dr. Luttge, the 
founding executive director of the 
McKnight Brain Institute. But out 
on the trails, he was just FireBall, 
an enthusiastic hiker eagerly soak-ing up the outdoors.
Luttge died Saturday from 
complications of multiple myelo-
ma, a plasma-cell cancer. He was 
67 years old.
Luttge worked for UF from 1971 
to 2004. He started as an assistant professor of neuroscience and rose to lead the department.
He focused on preventing dis-
eases through education.
“His idea wasn’t just lab re-
search for research’s sake, but lab research in the service of people and patients,” said Dr. Mark Gold, the chairman of the College 
of Medicine’s psychiatry depart-
ment.
In the 1990s, Luttge spearhead-
ed a proposal for an $18-million grant that would allow UF to build a brain and spinal cord research center.
The institute opened in 1998 
and brought in departments such 
as music and engineering. His ap-
proach broke down barriers be-tween disciplines, which made the institution notable and its solutions comprehensive.
“He always treasured the fact 
that the institute is not a building, it’s a campus-wide collaboration,” said Michaelyn Luttge, his wife of 
47 years.
Luttge would bound up ﬁ  ve 
stories of stairs, taking them two at 
a time, to grab Gold from a lab and bring him down to meet someone 
working in a new way.
“It would be hard to explain to 
you just what a debt of gratitude 
everyone in the College of Medi-
cine — and really everyone that’s 
beneﬁ  ted from treatment and dis-coveries from the McKnight Brain Institute — owe him as the never-say-no and never-say-die leader of 
the enterprise,” Gold said.
When Luttge retired eight years 
ago, he left for Georgia to hike the 
Appalachian Trail. He ﬁ  nished in Faculty member remembered for adventurous spirit

Every day Moe Rodriguez goes to 
work, he worries a police ofﬁ  cer will be 
the ﬁ  rst person through the door.
The men in uniform aren’t there to 
break up a drunken brawl. They come to say the three words every bar and club owner dreads: “Turn it down.”
Double Down Live, a live music ven-
ue and bar in downtown Gainesville, has been getting noise complaints as many as ﬁ  ve times a week since January.
Rodriguez, who owns and manages the business at 210 SW Second Ave, said police will sometimes show up during soundcheck around 5 p.m., before he 
opens the doors.
GPD Ofﬁ  cer Ernest Graham said ofﬁ  -
cers don’t measure noise levels until the 
complaints start to pile up. They usually let businesses off with warnings.
Which is why Rodriguez said he is 
worried. If he is violating the city’s noise ordinance, he will get a warning for the ﬁ  rst violation, be ﬁ  ned $250 for the sec-
ond violation and be ﬁ  ned $500 for the 
third violation, if all occur within one year. After the ﬁ  rst three documented violations, the owner can be criminally 
charged, according to GPD.

UF’s Board of Trustees discussed strategies 
for becoming a Top 10 university during a re-
treat at Lake Wauburg on Thursday but did not decide on a game plan.
James Duderstadt, president emeritus of the 
University of Michigan, presented his view of the future of the American public research uni-versity.
Sixty-ﬁ  ve to 70 percent of research done in 
the United States happens at public research universities, Duderstadt said. However, states are no longer able or willing to provide ﬁ  nan-
cial support for the sustained growth they hope 
to see in the public university system.
Public universities have also been hampered 
by the changing relationship between higher education and government, he said. Another 
issue is competition among universities for the 
best students, faculty, research grants and ath-letic facilities, among other things.
“This is a very aggressive competitive envi-
ronment in which the winner takes all,” Duder-stadt said of the higher education atmosphere.
One solution he suggested for keeping  
poorer institutions from falling prey to richer 
ones is resource-sharing.
Some of the strategies 
Duderstadt pitched, includ-ing seeking alternative fund-ing for research, are already in the works at UF.
A big part of Thursday’s 
discussion focused on how to launch UF into the Top 10 universities in the U.S. with 
a declining budget.
Earlier this month, the Florida Legislature 
laid out a budget plan that cut $36.5 million from UF.Trustees discuss plans to

packs to certain dollars in case the bank is robbed.
When someone tries to rob 
a bank, as the man at PNC did 
Wednesday, a bank teller is 
supposed to give him money that was connected to the dye pack. The pack detonates soon 
after the robber leaves, shoot-
ing paint on the robber and the money.
As policy, GPD does not tell 
the public how much money 
was stolen during bank rob-
beries because they don’t want other potential robbers to know how much cash is kept at par -
ticular banks in town, spokes-
woman Cpl. Angelina Valuri 
said Thursday.
The paint renders the money 
useless, and if it gets on some-
one’s skin, the paint can stay on 
for days no matter how much you scrub, Valuri said.
Officers are still looking for 
the robber and the driver of the getaway car. If anyone sees a white Tahoe with red paint on the passenger side, he or she

Spring Break will get a victory lap 
at the 16th annual Greater Gator Beer 
Festival this weekend.
The festival will be from 1 p.m. to 5 
p.m. Saturday at Magnolia Parke, 4700 
NW 39th Ave.
There will be free, unlimited sam-
ples of more than 100 beers, samples from Gainesville restaurants, soft 
drinks and bottled water, according to 
the event website.
You must be 21 or older to attend the 
festival and must bring a photo ID.
Ricki Black, organizer of the event, 
said people ﬂ  y and drive across the 
state to come to the festival. Some-times, she said, they mark the date on 
their calendars and call her to conﬁ  rm 
it’s still on.
“People seem to love it,” Black said. “It’s a chance for people to try beers 
that they have never tried before.”
Advance tickets can be purchased 
for $25 at ﬂ  oridabeerfestivals.com and 
general admission will be $30. “Instant 
In” tickets are $40, which will let par-
ticipants skip the line at 1 p.m. and go straight into the festival.
VIP tickets cost $50 and provide 
the perks of an “Instant In” ticket and 
access to ﬁ  ner food, beers and wines. 
Black said proceeds from the sales will 
go to the Helpful Hands Foundation.
For Black, the 16th annual Greater 
Gator Beer Festival will be like a Sweet 
16.

Five minutes.
Accent Speakers Bureau chairman 
Corey Portnoy said that’s how long it took to save his father, who received a bone marrow transplant in May while battling 
a rare form of cancer.
“Because someone took ﬁ  ve minutes 
out of their life to register, he has a second 
chance at life,” he said.
With the help of Accent, volunteer pro-
gram Footprints Buddy and Support Pro-gram will hold Dance Marrow-Thon, the ﬁ  rst bone marrow donor registration drive to be held at Dance Marathon at UF.
Students can register Saturday between 
9 p.m. and midnight. at the Stephen C. O’Connell Center.
“I see a lot of kids waiting for bone 
marrow transplants, and this is a way to get out there and ﬁ  ght for them,” said Eri-ca Sokol, president of Footprints.
Footprints, which helps kids and fami-lies in the Pediatric Oncology/Hematolo-gy Unit at Shands, registered 2,277 people 
in its ﬁ  rst three drives.
At Florida State University’s DM last 
month, Footprints registered 824 people 
in 16 hours.
The goal for Saturday’s drive is to reg-
ister 1,000 people in three hours, Sokol said.
Registration is open to anyone between 
the ages of 18 and 60 who is in good health, 
she said. Factors that would make a per-
son ineligible include a history of cancer or a heart attack.
The donor registration process involves 
completing a consent form and undergo-ing four cheek swabs.
“Any time between now and when you 
are not eligible any more at 61, you can be found to be a match,” Sokol said. “But the 
odds are about one in 1,000.”
She added that if a match is found, Gift 
of Life Bone Marrow Foundation will con-
duct further testing and will coordinate the actual donation.Dance Marathon to feature

organizer“It’s very clear that we’re not going 
to be able to use new revenues to do 
business as usual,” UF President Ber -
nie Machen said.
A bill that would allow UF to 
charge market-rate tuition, awaiting the governor’s approval, was meant to alleviate some of the budget defi-cit.
Some trustees argued UF wouldn’t 
get enough money fast enough to make a significant impact.
From a student’s perspective, said 
Student Body President Anthony 
Reynolds, Top-10 status isn’t a prior -
ity.“Students coming in are concerned 
about what they’re paying,” he said.
It’s not until after they graduate 
that most students become concerned with the reputation of their alma mat-
ers.
Reynolds also cautioned the trust-
ees not to overlook the fact that there is a portion of students who would struggle financially at the expense of 
building up other programs.
The Board of Trustees will meet 
again today to discuss undergraduate 
STEM education and future plans for alternative funding.

Students can discuss jobs and internships 
at an upcoming career fair without changing 
out of their pajama pants.
UF’s Career Resource Center will offer its 
first Virtual Career Fair from April 3 to April 
5. Registration opened last week, and students 
and alumni can sign up through the CRC web-site until the fair ends.
The Virtual Career Fair is hosted through 
virtual recruiting platform CareerEco and fea-tures 22 Southeastern Conference and Atlantic Coast Conference universities.
Students of all majors are encouraged to 
upload their resumes as soon as possible be-
cause employers are already reviewing them.
After logging in, students will be able to se-
lect an employer and enter a chat room with that employer’s representative, as well as oth-
er applicants.
Employers can invite students to private 
chat rooms, and they might ask to video chat.
Collaborating with other schools creates a wider pool of employers, said Angel Iverson, assistant director for career events with the CRC.
The CRC will host an in-house Virtual Fair 
Kickoff on April 3 from 10:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. in the CRC Library. CRC staff will be available to help navigate the fair.
“Everything is shifting virtually ,” said

driguez said. “I just want to run my 
business and put on good shows.”
The venue, a rectangular, 
white cinder-block building, has 
been an epicenter for live music in Gainesville. For the last eight 
years, it was the home of Common 
Grounds, which brought in both lo-cal and national acts, including Less Than Jake, Against Me! and Kenny Chesney.
Before that, the venue was called 
The Covered Dish, a live music club that opened around 1992, according to the Florida Department of State Division of Corporations.
Double Down Live opened in 
July and continues to put on con-certs of various genres.
In 2008, The Palms Condomini-
ums was built about 200 feet from 
the concert venue.
Rodriguez, his staff and some 
downtown business owners said they are baffled as to why people 
move to an area that is known for its entertainment if they are irritated by noise.
“This is a place that has been 
known for its concerts for decades,” Rodriguez said. “I don’t understand why people move down here and expect it not to be noisy.”
Lauren Sollaccio moved into a 
ground-floor condo facing the ven-
ue in July . The 26-year-old said she 
couldn’t stand the loud music when she first moved in, but she never 
called in a complaint.“It was pretty hellish getting 
used to it,” she said. “But we’ve 
only got a year here, so we’ll make it through.”
The Gainesville noise ordinance 
states that a noise disturbance must 
disturb a “reasonable person,” ex-
ceed 60 decibels — roughly the vol-ume of a casual conversation — at 
night and 66 during the day and 
must be clearly heard at least 200 feet from the “real property line” of the source of the sound.
Usually, GPD will just tell Rodri-
guez to turn down the music. But the owner has gotten two written warnings.
The first was in October during 
an alternative rock concert by Hel-met, and the second was at the be-ginning of March during a concert by folk artist Amy Ray , Rodriguez 
said.
Officer Graham said people who continually called in complaints about Common Grounds a few years 
ago were living in The Palms, but he did not know if the complaints about Double Down Live were from there as well because the callers chose to 
remain anonymous.
Sollaccio said when she moved 
in, the realtor told her the next-door 
venue, then vacant, used to be a bar that played music, but it was closed 
down and not reopening.
The leasing agents for the condo-
minium complex were not at the of-fice and did not return phone calls.
The only other nearby residential 
area is two streets south of the build-
ing on Southwest Second Place.
Jessica Gilbert, a resident who 
lives on Southwest Second Place, said she can hear the music from the club late at night, but it doesn’t irri-tate her.
“We moved here to be close to 
downtown,” said the 23-year-old plant molecular breeding graduate student. “We expected the noise.”
Rodriguez said he hopes the city 
will change its noise requirements to ease up on the downtown area.
Commissioner Jeanna Mastrodi-
casa said she understood Rodri-
guez’s concern.
She said the city will look into 
amending the ordinance, but a 
change could anger downtown resi-dents.
“Someone loses either way ,” she 
said.

his favorite candy, brisk walk
Maine in late September 2004.
Hikers he met along the way nicknamed him 
FireBall after the candy he liked to eat and the 
crispness of his walk. His wife, nicknamed Hot 
Chocolate, followed him in a truck with a trail-er, meeting him at predetermined stops for new supplies and good sleep.
The retired couple fell comfortably into this 
routine, hiking for six to nine months each year. Luttge completed the Pacific Crest Trail and Florida Trail, among others.
When Luttge’s wife and their dog, Percy, 
arrived at their meeting place before him, they would often hike in Luttge’s direction to sur -
prise him. But sometimes they chose the wrong one.
“People would have to say, ‘Oh, I think I saw 
this lady, she went the other way,’” she said. “So after a long day’s hiking, he would have to run the other way to find me.”
Luttge’s love for nature transcended the 
trails.
Last Christmas, Luttge and his grandson 
marked a path through the Luttges’ 20-acre 
property. They made a map and tested their 
skills with a treasure hunt. He had hoped that someday, he and his grandchildren would trav-el other trails together.
With them, he wasn’t Dr. Luttge, who found-
ed a prestigious research institute, or FireBall, who journeyed through the Applachian Trail.

A group of about 20 students 
marched from Turlington Plaza to 
the steps of Tigert Hall on Thursday 
to protest tuition hikes.
Organizers from the Gator Stu-
dent Alliance and Students for 
a Democratic Society said a new 
bill, SB 1752, would allow UF and 
Florida State University to increase tuition by more than the 15-percent yearly increase that is currently al-lowed.
To qualify for tuition increases, 
Florida universities must meet 11 of 14 criteria, which include a fresh-men retention rate of at least 90 per -
cent, 250 or more doctoral degrees awarded each year and a spot in the top 50 on at least two well-known national public university rankings.
UF and FSU are the only univer -
sities that meet the state criteria.
The two campus groups, how-
ever, maintain that tuition should stay low.
“We don’t have a say in where 
our money goes,” said Robbey Hayes, a 21-year-old SDS organizer and anthropology junior. “This is our way to tell the school and the legislature to stop screwing around with our tuition.”
About 30 people gathered at 
1:40 p.m. on Turlington Plaza for the protest. Several students gave 
speeches through a bullhorn while 
others cheered and waved signs.
Kayla McCurry, 20, told the 
group that for every five hours she spends in class, she has to spend 40 
hours working to afford the tuition.
“It’s not right,” the business 
sophomore said. “I’m falling behind 
because of tuition increases.”
About 20 of the protesters 
marched down Union Road escort-ed by representatives from the Divi-sion of Student Affairs.
Once they arrived at Tigert Hall, 
Hayes gave out Gov. Rick Scott’s of-fice phone number to get people to urge his office to veto the bill.
“Students are going to raise hell 
if he doesn’t veto it,” Chrisley Car -
pio, a 20-year-old history sopho-more, told one of Scott’s aides.
Assistant Vice President of Stu-
dent Affairs Jeanna Mastrodicasa 
met briefly with the group on be-half of UF President Bernie Machen 
to hear their complaints. She said although she realizes the students’ concerns, UF has no control of the bill.
“The decision is in the gover -nor’s hands,” she said.

Some universities now know stu-
dents’ sexual orientations as soon as 
they know their names.
A handful of public and private 
universities are moving toward ask-
ing prospective students about their 
sexual orientations on admission ap-plications. UF is not one of them.Last year, Elmhurst College, a 
private school in Illinois, became the first college or university to ask pro-spective students on their admission applications if they identify as les-bian, gay, bisexual or transgender.
Students who answer “yes” are 
eligible for a diversity scholarship.
The University of California 
Academic Senate recently proposed asking students about their sexual orientations on 
a document that accepted students must submit be-fore registering.
Both univer -
sities consider 
students’ LGBT 
status valuable 
demographic information.
By identifying students’ orienta-tions before they arrive, universi-
ties can invite them to participate in 
LGBT clubs and try to protect them from bullying roommates.
UF spokesman Steve Orlando 
said UF doesn’t ask students any questions about sexual orientation before or after admission, and it doesn’t plan to.
Lauren B. Hannahs, director of 
LGBT Affairs at UF, said she sees pros and cons of the effort.
Tracking a university’s retention 
of LGBT students could help the school gauge the success of LGBT programs, she said. But, counts 
based on admission documents may 
not be accurate.
“Many students won’t identify 
[as LGBT] until after they come to college and have that experience,” she said.
Although Hannahs doesn’t ex-
pect UF to make any changes to its application, she thinks it could be 
a good way to put a school on the 
map in the LGBT community.
“By putting it on paper, it is an 
acknowledgement,” she said, “and then those students are recognized.”Some colleges asking students to declare sexual orientation

Students can raise money for prema-
ture babies Saturday during a volleyball 
fundraiser.
PowerPlay Volleyball will host a vol-
leyball tournament at 9:15 a.m. at Forest Park Fields, 4501 SW 20th Ave., to raise 
money for the March of Dimes.  
Participants can pre-register to play 
with a team of four people or register Saturday . Players can participate in one of four divisions. Each division is based 
on skill level.
The tournament will include male 
teams, female teams and coed teams.
It costs $25 per player to play in three of the divisions, said John Babbit, owner 
of PowerPlay Volleyball and tourna-ment director.
To play in the highest skill level di-
vision, called OPEN, participants must pay $30 per person. It costs more to play 
in this division because participants are 
competing for at least $400, Babbit said. The final prize will be determined by 
how many teams compete.
Students will get a $5 discount with a 
student ID, but the players range in age from about 15 to about 60.
Babbit said he is expecting about 20 
to 30 teams to play but said the field can hold about 50 teams.
He said he hopes to raise about $2,000 
for the March of Dimes. This is the sec-ond year Babbit has hosted a tourna-
ment to benefit the charity.Volleyball fundraiser to

After eight years, the Channel 4 News Team 
will assemble once more.
Will Ferrell, clad in his signature maroon 
suit, announced Wednesday on “Conan” that 
Paramount Pictures will make “Anchorman 2: 
The Legend of Ron Burgundy’s Return.”
The original 2004 film, “Anchorman: The 
Legend of Ron Burgundy,” is a parody of 
1970s broadcast journalism and its day-to-day requirements — with Ferrell’s classic quirks thrown in. The movie was nominated in 2005 for several MTV Movie Awards and a People’s Choice Award.
UF students and professors expect the on-
screen shenanigans to continue in the sequel.
Kenneth Kidd, UF associate professor of 
English and film expert, said the sequel will be successful if it stays within the same frame-work as the original but has new and exciting content.
Brianne Wigley, 20-year-old telecommunica-tion junior and WUFT reporter, said she plans 
to see the movie and is ready for the inevitable 
comparisons to her job.
“We don’t have newsroom brawls with oth-
er stations,” she joked. “We don’t have as much fun as they do.”
Bridget Grogan, associate news director at 
WUFT-TV , said the only time the first movie 
is realistic is when Ron Bur -
gundy is tricked into read-
ing something inappropriate 
from a teleprompter.
“There’s a good point to 
that joke,” Grogan said. “Real people in the real world can be tripped up by not being familiar with their script.”
Some students were con-
cerned a sub-par sequel would cheapen the original film.
“You just leave it alone if it’s great,” said 
Reva Labbe, 20-year-old telecommunication junior.

Harry Potter e-books?Today’s question: Will you go see the “Anchorman” 
sequel?This week can definitely be summed up in one word: 
controversy.
Between the Supreme Court hearing oral arguments 
about the Affordable Health Care Act’s individual mandate 
and the arguments surrounding the Trayvon Martin shoot-ing, people are fired up, to say the least.
So, we ask you to take a minute from your Facebook and 
Twitter debates to relax for a second by reading this week’s OK-to-be-honest-some-of-the-stuff-in-this-editorial-will-probably-still-piss-you-off edition of...
Darts & Laurels
Let’s go ahead and get the bad stuff out of the way.We have to throw a huge let’s-calm-down-before-any-
needless-violence-occurs DART at @KillZimmerman, a 
Twitter account that believes the killer of Trayvon Martin “Should Be Shot Dead In The Street The Same Way TRAY -
VON Was.”
We cannot believe this person has more than 300 follow-
ers. This Twitter account does nothing to help the debate, nor does it bring a shred of justice to Trayvon. Be smart, people.
For completely trashing the First Amendment, we throw 
a sticks-and-stones DART at Garrett High School in Indi-
ana. Austin Carroll, a student at the school, was expelled for allegedly posting an expletive on his Twitter account using a school computer. The student, however, says he posted it from home.
Austin was three months from graduating. Are we re-
ally going to create a needless high-school dropout because of a cuss word? Let’s be adults.
Finally, we toss a you-can-run-but-you-can’t-hide 
DART at Darius D. Phillips, who fled from police early 
Wednesday morning after his original arrest only to be caught later that evening.
We’re sure that will help his case.For some good news, we give a sounds-like-a-good-start

increases and reduced hours to those who work on iPad and iPhone assembly lines.

On Saturday , former Vice President Dick Cheney 
underwent heart transplant surgery, prompting de-bates about whether the organ distribution was fair 
because Cheney is 71. Some speculated the prestige of the of-fice he once held gave him special treatment, which allowed him to move ahead on the priority list.
Cheney’s transplant throws the entire way the United 
States does organ donation into question.
Who should get priority: young or old? Is the system 
truly equal and equitable? Should organs be harvested from brain-dead patients? These questions may never be agreed upon by a majority of Americans, and they are the tip of the iceberg of a larger problem: the U.S. needs more organ do-nors.
Organ donation policies are currently left up to the states, 
although there is some federal legislation to standardize the procedure. Many states, including Florida, have an “opt-in” system where people can choose to be organ donors by put-ting an indication on their driver’s licenses.
Recently , many states have looked into changing their 
organ donation policies from an “opt-in” to an “opt-out” system. An “opt-out” policy would mean the state presumes you consent to be an organ donor unless you specifically declare otherwise. In 1993, Pennsylvania considered legisla-tion to change their organ donor program to “opt-out.” That legislation did not make it past committee hearings. Simi-lar measures were considered in Texas in 2003, Delaware in 2008, New York in 2010 and Colorado in 2011, all of which failed.
Why do states seem to be obsessed with presumed-con-
sent organ donation? The answer: They’ve looked across the pond to Europe. Spain’s “opt-out” system has the highest donor ratio with 34.4 donors per million people. Belgium and Austria’s donation rates increased after adopting “opt-out.” Italy , Norway and France also have presumed-consent organ donation.
Presumed consent may be the policy in Europe, but it should not be the policy in the U.S. Demand for organs is extremely high, and the waiting lists seem to keep growing, but the U.S. has the second-highest donor ratio, with 26.6 donors per million people.
The U.S. needs to increase or -
gan donation to help save lives, but presumed consent is antitheti-cal to liberty. Presumed consent 
implies the state owns your body and has a default right to harvest your internal organs.
Because beliefs change incrementally over time, an “opt-
out” program could lead to a mandatory donation system, which could, in turn, lead to government centers where peo-ple live only to have their organs harvested.
Think that’s not plausible? There are indications China 
has centers with the sole purpose of harvesting tissues and organs from those residing in the centers.
Would presumed consent mean doctors would work less 
diligently to save lives because they know some good would come from patient death in the form of organ donations?
Others think organ transplants should be put on a mar -
ket, just as in Iran and India. This idea sounds disheartening and immoral to me.
The way to increase organ donations is not presumed 
consent or through a market. The system we have in place is better than all the other industrialized countries except one; we should work to improve our system.
Although it doesn’t sound like enough, a huge public-
awareness campaign over a sustained period of time — sim-ilar to the anti-smoking movement — would yield results. Studies show Americans are the most generous people in the world. Trust that if an issue such as organ donation gen-erated enough publicity, Americans would respond.

opinions@alligator.org FRIDAY, MARCH 30, 2012 § ALLIGATOR, 7
Unfortunately, I have 
to take the Alligator and columnist Travis 
Hornsby to task for a recent column, “Obamacare may be unconstitutional.” 
The column is composed 
entirely of half-truths and 
faulty analysis. 
Although I understand that 
the role of a columnist is not to 
produce straight journalism, 
it is still the role of the edito-rial staff to remove falsehoods and mere bias masquerading as thought.
The headline really says 
it all. 
The name of the act is the 
Affordable Health Care Act 
— not the pejorative “Obam-acare.”
I won’t deny that this is 
a truly significant case and perhaps the most significant case since Miranda v. Ari-zona (the last of three cases cited in the article). 
With the exception of 
Brown v. Board of Educa-tion, none of the other cases 
he mentions were notewor -
thy until after they were de-
cided.
Hornsby also neglects to 
mention important cases like Bush v. Gore and Citizens United. 
While these two cases may 
seem relatively uncontrover -
sial to a newly minted con-servative and “outsiders” to the law, for people with legal knowledge and elsewhere on 
the political perspective, it is 
neither news nor analysis to point out that politics may play a part in the decisions of the Supreme Court of the 
United States.
But I suggest that Horn-
sby be less flippant when he 
dismisses the third branch of our constitutional system of checks and balances. 
He might note, for in-
stance, that although Ken-nedy’s vote is surely up for grabs, it is not the only vote 
that could swing. And surely 
he won’t be the only justice awake during oral argu-ments.
“Why should we care 
what some court says about the law?” Hornsby facetious-ly asks. 
Because, Travis, that court is the Su -
preme 
Court, 
cre -
ated by Article 3 of the Con-stitution, and it is decid-
ing what the Constitution 
means.
This may not be as catchy 
as the “I’m just a bill” song, but it is, I think, important.
When the justices decide 
this case, they won’t be wor -
rying about the billions of dollars in new taxes that 
“have been hidden” in it. (Es-
pecially since it contains tax breaks for small businesses, and since the Congressio-nal Budget Office says that 
eliminating the act would ac-
tually increase deficits in the long run.)
They won’t just be mak-
ing a political decision; they will be making a decision that says something about our Constitution, our repub-lic and the rule of law.
So, “chances seem very 
good” that SCOTUS will overturn the Affordable Care 
Act? 
That might be true if there 
weren’t years of precedent 
on Congress’s interstate 
commerce and taxing pow-
ers pointing in the exact op-posite direction.
Consider one somewhat 
recent case, authored by Jus-
tice Antonin Scalia: Raich v. 
Gonzalez.
To make a long story 
short, Raich, a medicinal 
marijuana patient in Califor -
nia, grew a small amount of 
marijuana to help her deal with symptoms from an in-operable brain tumor. 
Scalia decided that the 
federal government did have power, under the commerce clause, to limit her choice of medicine.
The Supreme Court isn’t 
being asked to “create a new power for the federal gov-ernment.” 
It is simply being asked to 
affirm one aspect of the same old power it has been wield-ing since its inception: The power to limit some choices for the greater good.
Lewis Kirvan is a second 
year law student at UF.
I am writing in response to the column titled, 
“Cheaters lessen value of all University of Florida degrees,” published on March 21. First and fore-
most, the author of this particular column made sev-eral accurate statements: Cheating is wrong, and any-one caught cheating deserves to face the appropriate consequences.
But that is precisely the point that needs to be illus-
trated. The 97 students who were found to have “irre-futably” cheated are being held accountable through the appropriate procedures the university has adopted 
for these types of situations, as outlined in the Student 
Conduct Code.
The author of the article claims that the universi-
ty’s administration is indifferent and apathetic toward 
cheating and that these incidents of cheating are not 
being referred to the Dean of Students Office and Stu-
dent Conduct and Conflict Resolution (SCCR).
He goes on to say that “these students will not 
be expelled. Nor will they be referred to the Dean of 
Students or the Student Conduct Committee if they 
admit to cheating. As long as they admit to cheating, 
they will not even fail the course.”
It appears that there has been a misunderstand -
ing about the conduct process. Per university policy, 
a faculty member may not take any form of academic 
action against a student for an alleged Honor Code 
violation without reporting the incident to the Dean of 
Students Office. Doing so would violate the student’s right to due process. While not all 97 students will ap-pear before the Student Conduct Committee, all 97 
students have been referred to SCCR and the Dean 
of Students Office and are going through the conduct 
process.
First-time Honor Code offenders at UF have the 
option to resolve the incident with the course instruc-
tor through the faculty/student resolution form, and 
a majority of the 97 implicated students have chosen 
this option. That is not to say that they are not facing the consequences of violating the Honor Code. They are.
The instructor of the course has recommended that 
students who admit to cheating receive a 0 percent on the exam and a 5 percent course grade reduction, re-sulting in 75 percent being the highest possible grade for a student who cheated can earn in the course. Any decisions made by the Student Conduct Committee and Dean of Students Office will heavily weigh the in-structor’s recommendation, which is consistent with university policy.
Furthermore, any student found responsible for violating the Honor Code will have that violation on his or her student records, and all students who are found re-sponsible or admit responsi-
bility will have to report this violation on graduate and professional school applications.
As stated on the SCCR website, “Student Conduct 
and Conflict Resolution is dedicated to encouraging responsible community conduct, educating the UF and Gainesville community, and implementing dis-
ciplinary action in situations where violations of the 
Student Conduct Code have occurred…Through the 
disciplinary process, it is our aim to help students un-derstand the impact their behavior has on the global community and to assist them with making future de-
cisions that lead to personal and professional success” 
(This can be found at www.dso.ufl.edu./sccr).
The students, faculty and staff members who serve 
on the Student Conduct Committee take their respon-
sibility to uphold the Student Conduct Code very seri-
ously and volunteer a significant amount of their time 
to ensure that students are given a fair resolution for 
any alleged violation of university policy.
In honoring the educational and restorative philos-
ophy of the student conduct process at UF, expulsion 
is considered a last-resort consequence for a violation 
of university policy. Careful consideration is given to 
both an individual’s intent and his or her impact on others and the community when making decisions regarding a student’s future at UF. The decision-mak -
ing body must also weigh the intent and the impact 
of each sanction given to a student. While some may 
think that expulsion is the easy answer to academic misconduct, the impact of that sanction on an indi-vidual’s future reaches much farther than UF and has 
the potential to impact that individual for the rest of 
his or her life.
If you still feel UF could do more in dealing with 
Honor Code and Conduct Code violations, you may 
contact the Dean of Students Office for more informa-tion about the Student Conduct Committee or myself, at saahilpa@dso.ufl.edu, about the Honor Code Ad-ministration. I strongly encourage you to join the Stu-dent Conduct Committee and/or the Student Honor Code Administration through which you can take a larger part in the Student Conduct processes of the university and ensure that your voice is heard.

Jacob Atem poses inside Weimer Hall on Wednesday.
CHRISTY HANBYUL NA
Alligator Contributing Writer
Jacob Atem remembers the 
day his parents were killed.
He was taking care of the 
cattle in the field with his cousin 
when he saw smoke rising from his village. Enemy troops killed his parents, and his sister became 
a slave to an Arab Sudanese fam-
ily. Atem was 6 years old.
After walking barefoot for 
months, suffering dehydration and malnutrition and watching 
thousands of other children die 
along the way, Atem found ref-uge in Ethiopia and was eventu-ally sent to America by a non-
profit organization.
Atem is one of the more than 
20,000 “Lost Boys of Sudan,” a 
group of children who were or -
phaned and displaced during 
the Second Sudanese Civil War. 
He co-founded the Southern Su-dan Health Care Organization, a nonprofit organization, with an-
other survivor, Lual Deng.
“What we went through, peo-
ple should never go through,” 
said Atem, a 26-year-old Ph.D. student in health services re-
search and management and 
policy at UF.
The organization’s goal is to 
make Sudan safer by providing health care services to people in South Sudan. Atem said his long-term goal is to create a health clinic in Sudan that will become a model for the rest of the world 
to follow.
He said his education at UF 
will help him establish the clinic 
in Sudan and give him training to run the health clinic and make 
it sustainable.
SSHCO built its first health 
clinic in Maar, a village in south-
ern Sudan, in 2011.
Chad Papa, a 22-year-old en-
vironmental science senior and president of UF’s chapter of In-visible Children, said Atem’s 
organization is a huge step for -
ward.
“Having no health care to 
having health care is really a big 
milestone in Sudan,” Papa said.
Although the organization 
reached its initial goal to build a center in Sudan, Atem needs more funding to sustain the 
clinic.
Challenges include staffing 
the clinic as well as paying for 
utilities and getting medical sup-plies.
SSHCO is looking for vol-
unteers and donations to raise funds to send medical equip-
ment, including scalpels and sy-
ringes, to the clinic. Atem is also looking for students who want to understand the issues behind the political conflicts in Sudan 
and Africa.
Gainesville resident Peter G. 
Roode, a Pittsburgh-born retired 
surgeon who briefly lived in Su-
dan as a child, recently heard 
about Atem’s story and contact-ed him. Roode is following him to Sudan in a few weeks to per -
form surgeries and help Atem at 
the new clinic.
Sixty years ago, Roode’s fa-
ther was in Sudan and a man 
from the woods offered to help 
him get by in an unfamiliar land. 
Now, Roode hopes to help Atem in his journey.
“I’m a brother to Jacob,” 
Roode said. “Even if we have 
different skin colors.”
“People call us ‘the lost boys 
of Sudan,’ but we’re not really 
lost,” Atem said. “We’re find-
ing our way to a better world of 
hope.”

 Throughout Omarius Hines’ career, 
coaches have opined about getting him the 
ball more. 
  After two years at wide receiver, how-
ever, the touches came at a crawling, 1.31 reception-per-game pace. Last season, they 
trickled into Hines’ hands even slower when he was moved to tight end.
  Now, as a redshirt senior, Hines is trying 
his hand at running back in offensive coor-dinator Brent Pease’s ﬁ  rst spring at the helm 
of Florida’s offense. 
  While Hines said he played running 
back only sparingly in high school, he has impressed both coach Will Muschamp and 
Pease in the Gators’ early practices.
  “He’s such a gifted athlete, it’s kind of 
learning different spots of where he’s going to be,” Pease said. “He’s got that ability now. He’s natural. ... He’s got a lot of abilities 
knowing his hands and his explosion just 
running the ball — his physical attributes.”
  Hines said his most recent position 
switch came from frustration with his lack of playing time. 
After redshirting, he caught 41 passes for 
559 yards and just two touchdowns in three seasons. He also has carried the ball 13 times for 164 yards and two scores, with his lon-
gest rush coming in 2010 against Tennessee 
on a 36-yard fake punt.
  “You come to a place like this expecting 
to play a lot, and when you don’t play you get kind of down or whatever,” Hines said. “But the coaches have been keeping my 
head up and letting me know, just be patient 
and that’s what I’ve been doing.”
  The 6-foot-2, 223-pound Hines gives UF 
added depth at the running back position after the departures of Chris Rainey and Jeff Demps. Though the Gators have tailbacks 
Mike Gillislee and Mack Brown returning, Florida’s staff has also converted former safety Chris “Juice” Johnson to play in the 
backﬁ  eld.
  Purifoy battling:   Defensive coordina-
tor Dan Quinn said sophomore corner-back Loucheiz Purifoy is making strides in the competition to start alongside Marcus 
Roberson.
  “He really came on and played some 
(late last season), and all the way through the bowl preparations is when you really see 
the guy break through,” Quinn said. “That game, he played a bunch. So going into the offseason we were saying,‘Alright, now the light’s gone on,’ so to speak, for him.”
  Coming off a 27-tackle season with one 
forced fumble as a freshman, Purifoy has dealt with a sprained right shoulder for the 
last 10 days but has continued to practice.
  Purifoy is mainly competing with ju-
niors Jaylen Watkins and Cody Riggs — last year’s starter opposite Roberson — for play-

After struggling to ﬁ  nd his way onto the ﬁ  eld during his ﬁ  rst three seasons, Omarius 
Hines, seen running during a recent practice, is making the switch to running back.  
 Notebook: Hines making switch to running back
 Saturday’s loss to Louisville left a sour 
taste in every Florida fan’s mouth, but here’s a chance to cleanse your 
palate. 
  Sure, a second consecutive 11-point 
collapse in the ﬁ  nal nine minutes of an Elite Eight game is disappointing, but look at the bright side. The team ranked No. 8 in the preseason matched expecta-tions and this group was a joy to watch.
And since the Gators are 0-5 against 
this year’s Final Four, that trip to New Orleans probably wouldn’t have been a whole lot of fun for them anyway . 
  Plus, there were a ton of highlight-
reel plays along the way that somehow did not ﬁ  nd a spot on a certain network’s 
coveted list. 
Let’s take a 
look at our Top 10, and be sure to check out alliga-torSports.org for 
links to the video 
clips. 
  10. Patric 
Young’s alley-oop against Ar-
kansas. The Gators were already up 23, but that doesn’t make this play any less impressive. Erving Walker drove baseline and ﬂ  ipped it to Young for a thunderous 
slam that left the backboard shaking. 
  9 . Mike Rosario’s behind-the-back 
pass against Kentucky. Rosario provid-
ed a highlight from Florida’s disastrous trip to Rupp Arena by pump-faking Kyle Wiltjer, driving and ﬁ  nding Young with a no-look, behind-the-back pass for an easy two. This play might have been higher on the list if Anthony Davis hadn’t swatted 
Rosario’s 3-point attempt about four sec-
onds beforehand. 
8. Patric Young’s alley-oop dunk 
against Louisville. I’m sure nobody wants to hear about Louisville anymore, but this play is worth revisiting. Young and Walker operate the pick and roll to perfection, and Walker’s slightly errant pass only adds to the aesthetic value. The 
distance the ball covers as Young toma-
hawks it forward is pretty insane. 
  7. Kenny Boynton’s and-1 layup 
against Arkansas. Boynton drove around 
a defender, leapt into Arkansas’ Hunter Mickelson, absorbed contact, switched hands in mid-air and scooped home the Gators get 
some much-
deserved

 Karsten Whitson won’t take the mound 
for the Gators this weekend. 
  It’s nothing new.  The right-hander from Chipley hasn’t 
pitched in a game in more than a month. 
Whitson entered his sophomore season 
looking for a marquee year, but now he will once again be watching from the dugout when No. 1 Florida (23-2, 5-1 Southeastern Conference) takes on No. 16 Ole Miss (18-7, 3-3 SEC) in a three-game series beginning to-night at 7:30 at Oxford-University Stadium. 
  “Obviously he’ll be on a pitch count, but 
he’s ready ,” UF coach Kevin O’Sullivan said more than a week ago. 
“We’ve been very careful with it, but he looks great and he feels great.”
  The plans were for 
Whitson to either start in Tuesday’s win against Florida State or this week-
end against Ole Miss. He was not made available to the local media after the an-nouncement came Thursday that Whitson would once again sit out against the Rebels. 
However, O’Sullivan did speak with Ken-
dall Rogers, managing editor of baseball scouting service Perfect Game.
  According to Rogers, O’Sullivan said 
Whitson continues to look “great” in bullpen sessions but that he’d like to see one or two more sessions before starting him. O’Sullivan told Rogers he was hoping for a return next week but does not want to rush Whitson.

Throughout the past six months, 
Mackenzie Caquatto’s ankles have 
been on a roller-coaster ride.
Caquatto, a sophomore, has 
struggled with severe pain from a 
bilateral ankle sprain she suffered in 
September during the final selection camp for the 2011 U.S. world team. She sprained and tore ligaments in both of her ankles after landing short on a double-pike dismount on balance beam. 
The ankle injuries held her out 
for four months and have hampered her progress on multiple events. As an uneven bars and beam special-ist her freshman year, she has been limited to only eight appearances on bars this season. 
“I know she’s in a tremendous 
amount of pain,” coach Rhonda Faehn said. “They’re hurting, they’re 
bruised and they’re sore. She’s just 
tough.” 
When Caquatto returned on bars 
in late January, she made an imme-diate impact, winning four straight 
titles from Jan. 27 to Feb. 17 and av-eraging a 9.92 within that span.
Then, UF experimented with Ca-
quatto on beam exhibitions against 
Auburn and Georgia. But the result wasn’t too promising. 
“If she would take a short landing 
on beam, she would re-aggravate it all over again,” Faehn said. “That’s why we decided we’re going to shut down the beam and focus on letting her heal.”
Due to the pounding from beam 
dismounts, Caquatto experienced a reoccurrence of intense discomfort in her ankles and sat out Florida’s 
final regular-season home meet 
against Utah on March 16. 
The week before, she received 
platelet-rich plasma injections in her ankles in hopes of healing them quickly before the postseason. 
“She was just having so much 
pain that we really just felt with the trainers and the doctors that [the 
PRP injection therapy] was some-
thing she’d be able to benefit from,” Faehn said. “We opted to do it to see if it helps take some of the inflam-mation away and ease her pain a little bit.”
The therapy proved to be effec-
tive as Caquatto bounced back at the Southeastern Conference Cham-
pionships the next weekend. In an 
under-the-radar performance, she posted an impressive 9.9 on bars after hitting most of her handstands and sticking her dismount.
Caquatto, who only practiced 
two bars dismounts leading up to the competition, tied for second  place behind only UF sophomore 
Alaina Johnson (9.925). 
“I did one of my best bars rou-
tines this season,” Caquatto said. 
“After my ankles, it’s especially that much better because it’s been a hard and long process coming back.”
Faehn said Caquatto would only 
see bars again when No. 1 Florida heads to the NCAA Regional on 
April 7 in the Reynolds Coliseum in 
Raleigh, N.C. 
After being named to the All-
SEC Gymnastics Second Team, her first SEC yearly honor, Caquatto will enter next Saturday’s meet with her head held high.
“She’s just a fighter,” Faehn said. 
“She’s not going to let [her ankle 
injuries] affect her mentally . She’s 
pushing through and making the absolute best of the situation.”FRIDAY, MARCH 30, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 15

“I get better by practicing with Tony 
(McQuay) and guys like him,” Graham 
said.
Graham came to Florida after becoming 
the 2011 FHSAA Class 4A State runner-up in the 400m with the time of 46.72 — .28 
seconds slower than his personal best. 
In high school, Graham was also part of 
the 2011 Miami Herald All-Dade Track and Field First Team in the 100m and 4x400m in addition to the 400m. 
As a freshman at UF, Graham placed 
fourth at the Southeastern Conference 
Indoor Championship in the 400m and 
the was part of a fourth-place 4x400m re-
lay team. He was also able to qualify for the NCAA Indoor Championship in the 400m.
“It was a big change as far as the com-
petition and the attention,” Graham said. “In high school, I was able to run hard when I wanted to run hard, but in college it’s a whole other level.”
As Graham heads to his first outdoor 
meet this weekend at the 85th Annual Clyde Littlefield Texas Relays in Austin, Texas, he’s excited to see what he can ac-complish.
The Texas Relays is the first outdoor 
meet of the season for many of Florida’s top track and field athletes. Holloway said the Gators are ready to see where they 
stand among the other 
teams.
“It gives us a chance 
to see some of the com-petition from the south-
west and from the west 
coast at this meet,” Hol-loway said. “It’s always been a meet we’ve been 
able to go to and gauge where we’re at in our training. We’re going to open up in our relays this weekend with the men and women’s [4x100m] and [4x400m].”Although Florida has come close to an 
outdoor national title the last three years, it hasn’t won one yet. But Holloway said he is ready for his teams to show everyone at this meet what they’re capable of this 
year. 
The meet opened up Wednesday with 
sophomore Brittany Harrell competing in 
the first day of the heptathlon. She finished Thursday in second place with a personal 
record and automatically qualified for the 
NCAA Outdoor Championships.
“The thing that people don’t under -
stand is we’ve done very well indoors, but 
we’re an outdoor program, so we feel bet-
ter about being outdoors,” Holloway said. “We’re a lot more comfortable outdoors than we are indoors.”Sprinter Graham leading Gators relay charge at first outdoor event

In the minutes after Sun-
day’s win against Mississippi, 
Allie Will walked into the con-ference room of the Ring Ten-nis Complex to field questions 
from the media.
The junior has gone through 
the routine dozens of times, 
answering questions with ease. Then, something caught her off-guard. How, she was asked, did she feel about win-ning her 100th match as a Gator?
“That’s great news,” she 
said, clearly surprised. “I’ve had a lot of good matches, and I haven’t lost a match (at home) so I’m happy that I was able to get to 100 wins and hopefully I’ll have a few more before the year is over.”
For the nation’s top-ranked 
singles player on the nation’s second-ranked team, acco-lades and accomplishments are nothing new. All year long, when asked about a list of items ranging from the team’s 103-match home win streak to her recently attained No. 1 singles ranking, Will had an al-most identical response — she was just trying to get better. Her coach, Roland Thornqvist, 
echoed that sentiment.
“She obviously likes to win, 
but this year, she’s worked re-
ally, really hard,” he said. “She was a tremendous worker the first two years, but she’s put-ting in twice the work this year. Huge appetite for the game and for getting better, 
and I think you’re seeing it in 
her game.”
As skilled as Will is, im-
provements at this stage in the season are minimal. She is Florida’s best player in almost every area of the game. Aside from being a tremendous nat-ural athlete, Will has a lethal backhand, a powerful serve and a forehand that Thornqvist 
said she takes for granted. Still, 
she sincerely believes there is plenty of work to be done.
“For me, it’s just about 
playing the way I do in prac-tice in a real match,” she said. “I’ve been working on hitting my serve a little bit more. It’s about moving my feet, trying 
to get to the net, and trying to 
be as aggressive as I can.”
Her attitude and hunger for 
continued improvement have rubbed off on her teammates. 
Throughout this season, the defend-ing national 
champions 
have seen improve-ments in singles and doubles.  
Even after the Gators lost to Stanford last month, Thorn-
qvist saw the team’s mentality 
change. That, he said, started with Will.
When Florida takes the 
court against Auburn today at 1 p.m., Will’s hard work will be put to the test in search of her 
101st win. Thornqvist said that 
as much as the team doesn’t talk about numbers, this is one worth noting.
“Allie winning 100 match-
es in her junior year is pretty amazing,” he said. “I don’t know if I’ve ever been around that before. We don’t really 
talk about numbers or rank-
ings or anything like that re-ally, but this one you have to acknowledge.”Rankings, accolades

UF coachshell of his former self. In a Feb. 26 start 
against William & Mary , O’Sullivan pulled Whitson in the first inning after just 13 pitches and two outs. 
“You could tell he wasn’t feeling his 
best,” O’Sullivan said after the game. “You’ll see early-season stuff where the arm just doesn’t bounce back as quickly as you want. I’m sure he’s going to be fine.”
But after that weekend, each week 
added to the mystery of when Whitson would really come back. The reasons for his absence were never entirely clear.
After a promising freshman campaign, 
Whitson missed a majority of pitching time in the fall with a groin injury. He be-gan spring bullpen workouts earlier than the other pitchers and appeared ready to go during an impressive outing in his final preseason scrimmage.
O’Sullivan explained the contrast from 
a scrimmage in which Whitson threw in the mid-90s to the outing against William 
& Mary, when Whitson was clocked in the 
mid-80s, by saying arms just aren’t always consistent at the start of the year.
“It happens a lot and you see that in 
spring training with big-league pitch-ers and it’s just one of those things,” O’Sullivan said. “The most important thing is structurally it’s fine. He’s in great spirits and I know he wants to be out 
there, but once again, it’s not going to be until he’s 110 percent.”
Heading into the season, Whitson was 
excited to eliminate the restraints that 
were on him as a freshman. He was look-ing forward to extending his pitch counts and going further into games. 
Now he just looks to be on the field 
again, whenever that may be.lefty, high-arcing layup, all before returning to 
the ground. 
6. Casey Prather’s alley-oop finish against 
Marquette. Boynton threw the lob from two 
steps inside the half-court line and Prather did 
the rest. He caught the ball facing midcourt be-
fore somehow starting a spin in midair to finish facing the basket. He made it look much, much easier than it probably was. 
5. Brad Beal’s dunk on South Carolina’s Da-
montre Harris. With Florida up by six and four 
minutes remaining, Beal’s finish provided the dagger. Walker found Beal cutting to the basket and the freshman took two steps, jumped, stiff-
armed Harris and powered home the jam. It was 
flat-out mean. 
4. Young’s follow-up slam against Missis-
sippi State. It’s criminal that this play isn’t on 
YouTube. After Walker missed a transition three, Young couldn’t have asked for a better rebound. He out-jumped Rodney Hood, gathered the ball and threw it home in one fluid, flawless motion. 
3. Beal’s dunk on Moussa Gueye of Ala-
bama. With the game already in hand, Beal split a trap — cough, double dribble, cough — and delivered the same stiff-arm and posterization combo he hit Harris with. It was even meaner than the first. Sure, he and Young were T’d up for their celebration afterward, but it was worth it. “BOW TO YOUR SENSEI!”
2. Casey Prather’s dunk on Wiltjer in the 
SEC Tournament. After a ho-hum season, this 
dunk put Prather on the map. Walker drove the lane and found a trailing Prather. The sopho-more took one dribble, jumped about 18 feet in the air and slammed it on a helpless Wiltjer. The only thing better than the dunk was Boynton’s celebration. 
1. Patric Young’s block and finish against 
FSU.  Bernard James thought he had a wide-open 
dunk from the baseline, but Young had other 
ideas. Young came flying down the lane and, us-
ing only his left hand, ripped the ball right out of James’ grasp, reeling it in and coming down in bounds. On the ensuing possession, Yeguete claimed an offensive rebound and found Young for the uncontested two-handed slam, a double-feature more than worthy of the No. 1 spot.

ing time. 
“Purifoy has really improved from Day 1 when I met him,” 
Watkins said. “He’s starting to understand the defense. He’s 
starting to make plays on the ball, he’s real physical. He’s trying to get strips. He’s out there doing what he needs to do.”
Defensive playmakers: Despite ending last season as two of 
Florida’s three top tacklers, linebackers Jon Bostic and Jelani Jen-kins are being challenged to produce even more on defense.
While Muschamp described both players’ performances as solid so far in spring practice, he wants to see more big plays out 
of the pair. UF tied for 112th nationally last sea-
son in turnovers forced, leaving room for im-provement in Quinn’s second season coaching the defense.
“We are really counting on these lineback-
ers to really make some plays,” Quinn said. “To be in coverage and get a batted ball or an 
interception, that kind of production is what 
we’re talking about. ... Both of those guys have the explosiveness to create big plays.”
