An email with instructions on how to “mack and suc-
ceed at parties” from a member of a fraternity at Geor-
gia Tech might have made some UF students smirk, but others aren’t laughing — even after the author publicly apologized.
In the mass email that quickly circulated social net-
working sites, the author gave fraternity brothers a step-by-step tutorial on how to get women to drink more and sleep with them.
Isabella Valderrama, an 18-year-old UF management 
freshman, said she thought the article was gross.
“He made (rape) seem like something that isn’t such 
a big deal,” she said. “It is a big deal. It does happen. It’s prevalent, and it’s an issue.”
Clay Townsend, a 20-year-old applied physiology and 
kinesiology junior, is in Alpha Tau Omega. He said he thinks the TFM culture is growing.
“A lot of people are taking on that frat guy persona,” 
he said.
Julia Rae Varnes, a specialist at GatorWell Health Pro-
motion Services, said it’s disappointing and disturbing the author felt it was OK to write and send the email. His willingness to do so may point to an even more disturbing reality — the inﬂ  uence of “rape culture.”
Rape culture is a culture in which rape is perpetuated, 
normalized and seen as permissible. It leads to a broad misunderstanding of what determines sexual assault and rape, Varnes said. She said rape is exactly what the author of the email is talking about.
“Getting someone drunk with the purpose of having 
sex with them — that’s rape,” Varnes said.
She said one of the biggest myths is that if someone is 
intoxicated, he or she can legally consent. Varnes said the 
legal blood alcohol content level to consent is .08, which is 
the same as the legal limit to drive.
“The absence of ‘no’ does not mean the presence of 
‘yes,’” she said.
However, Varnes said she recognizes only one person 
wrote the email, and she doesn’t assume he represents a larger entity.
“I don’t think he’s the only person in the world who 
has this thought process, but I do hope he’s a small minor-
ity,” she said.
Varnes said the best method of prevention is bystander 
intervention, and that students should be looking out for 
each other.
“If something doesn’t look right,” she said, “Speak up 
and say something.”UF reacts to

Construction on two roads 
that will form the backbone of 
the 40-acre Innovation Square project is underway.
By the end of April, South-
west Ninth Street and South-west Third Avenue will converge at the lot near the university across from South-west 13th Street where the Alachua General Hospital once stood.
The roads will establish a 
walkable grid for businesses moving closer to UF and will increase the partnership be-tween downtown and UF, ac-cording to an email from Josh Steppling, who is in charge of communications at Trimark Properties, a Gainesville de-velopment company.
“A framework is being cre-
ated to facilitate the creation of local businesses and the relo-cation of businesses outside of Gainesville,” Steppling said.
Ed Poppell, an Innovation 
Square organizer, said the ﬁ  rst building on the site — the Innovation Hub — houses 26 startup companies with tech-nologies developed by UF stu-dents.
The goal is to help the area 
expand even more, and the ﬁ  rst step is to have an acces-sible grid system in place, he said. This is where the roads come in.

A new California tuition law al-
lows for up to six of the state’s schools 
to charge extra for their more popular courses, but UF classes are currently safe from the price increase.UF spokesman Steve Orlando said 
if tuition changes of that nature were to come to Florida, the change would 
have to come from the Florida Legis-
lature and the Board of Governors be-cause the university doesn’t control its tuition prices.
“That decision would have to come 
from somewhere above us,” Orlando said. “I’m not aware of any conversa-tions like that taking place here.”
The California bill, successor to 
Santa Monica College’s two-tiered tu-ition plan that was canceled in 2012, was signed Thursday. The California Community College Chancellor’s Of-ﬁ  ce announced in 2012 that it found 
the practice would not be permis-
sible under the California Education Code. 
Judy Guevara, a 19-year-old UF 
psychology sophomore, said classes are already expensive without tuition hikes for popular courses.
“A lot of popular classes are re-
quired,” Guevara said. “It would pre-
vent people who can’t pay for them 
from completing their degrees.”Popular classes don’t cost more at UFSEE INNOVATION, PAGE 4“The absence of ‘no’ does not mean the

UF students looking to under-
stand their peers may want to put down their smartphones and pick up Dostoevsky.
A study published in the journal 
Science earlier this month found 
literary ﬁ  ction increases people’s 
social perception and emotional intelligence.
The study, conducted by re-
searchers at The New School for Social Research in New York City, compared the effect literary ﬁ  ction has on people’s empathy, as op-
posed to popular ﬁ  ction and non-
ﬁ  ction.
Researchers discovered that 
people temporarily scored higher 
on social perception tests after 
reading literary ﬁ  ction.
Gregory Webster, an assistant 
professor of psychology at UF, 
said the results seem logical.
“The way we understand each 
other is by understanding emo-
tions and emotional reactions,” 
he said. “One way to understand different perspectives is through stories.”
Webster said literary ﬁ  ction in-
creases social perception more than 
other types of writing because it 
usually has more character depth and different perspectives.
“If I can understand how a liter-
ary character thinks and feels, I’ll 
probably better understand how 
other people view things,” Web-
ster said.Norman Holland, a UF English 
professor emeritus and writer of “Literature and the Brain,” has ex-tensively researched the psychol-
ogy of reading.
He said the emotional reaction people feel when reading a story is 
very real.
Two different parts of your 
brain process emotions and sto-
ries, so readers can know a story is 
ﬁ  ction but still have an emotional response, he said.
Holland said he questions the 
ﬁ  ndings, though.
“The mere act of reading 
doesn’t make you a more sensitive person,” he said. “The act of read-ing, thinking and talking about it 
makes you more sensitive.”   
UF librarian John Van Hook 
said he also believed there is more 
to the study than meet the eye.
“You don’t convince people to 
read literary ﬁ  ction by telling them it’s good for them any more than 
you could expect results by saying 
the same thing about running, fall-ing in love or listening to Mozart,” 
he said.
David Leavitt, a UF English 
professor, said he was pleased 
with the research ﬁ  ndings.
“The results kind of validated 
something that I have often be-lieved and that has been a princi-
ple of my teaching,” he said.
Jillian Boyar, a 19-year-old UF 
biology sophomore, said she en-
joys reading, but she doesn’t think 
studies like these will increase col-
lege students’ interest  in reading 
literature.
“With social media, people do 
a lot less pleasure reading,” Boyar 
said. “It’s easier to mess around 
on Facebook than to open up ‘War 
and Peace.’”TUESDAY, OCTOBER 15, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 3

A UF student organization that makes and deliv-
ers 150 meals a week to needy residents in Alachua 
County is now gearing up for “Turkeypalooza.”
Campus Kitchens is collecting food supplies for 
an annual Thanksgiving community dinner that 
will be held at the Boys & Girls Club at Woodland 
Park in November.
Fremon Williams, the program’s director, said 
Turkeypalooza has been a success in the past.
“I would just love to see the continuation of 
Campus Kitchens here at the Boys & Girls Club,” Williams said. “Everything they’re doing is great.”Last year, Turkeypalooza was more of a food 
drive than it was a community dinner, said Nico Waler, a UF biology senior and co-president of Campus Kitchens. The organization raised money 
and had typical Thanksgiving foods donated, such 
as cranberry jam and green beans.
Throughout the year, the group works with 
Gator Dining and local organizations to make sure cooked-but-uneaten leftover food on campus is taken to homeless shelters and community centers in the county, said Laurel Nesbit, program assistant at the UF Ofﬁ  ce of Sustainability.
Waler, who became a part of Campus Kitchens 
during his freshman year, said the entire commu-nity interacts during the events.
“Everybody gets to hang out, get to know each 
other and eat free food,” he said.Group prepares for ‘Turkeypalooza’ � HIS BOND IS $15,000.

An Alabama man was arrested 
Monday at about 5 a.m. after he 
yelled that he wanted to kill a man and threatened him with a pocket knife.
Jose Adan Villarreal Jr., 38, 
of Mobile, Ala., was arrested on Southwest 40th Boulevard off of Archer Road, near a Super 8 Motel. He was charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon without intent to kill — a third de-gree felony. 
According to a Gainesville Po-
lice report, Villarreal was arguing with William Lee Rice, also of Mo-bile, Ala. The words escalated, and 
the argument turned physical. A 
witness pulled Villarreal back, and he fell outside the room, according to the report.
Rice heard the witnesses yelling 
that Villarreal had grabbed a knife, and he reappeared in the doorway holding a pocket knife.
He pointed the knife at Rice and 
yelled, “I’m going to f**king kill you,” as he moved toward Rice.
The two witnesses stood be-
tween the men. Rice said later he was afraid Villarreal would be able to push past them to cut him.

booked into the Alachua County Jail, where he remained as of press

UF’s Counseling & Wellness Center is promoting a new 
initiative to train students and faculty how to help and recog-
nize students in distress.
The online interactive program, Kognito, consists of role-
playing training simulations and games in the areas of health 
and behavioral health.
The program at UF has a version for students and one for 
faculty and staff, said Jaime Jasser, life mental health counselor 
and program coordinator for Kognito at the wellness center.
“It’s an online, interactive training program to help stu-
dents recognize common signs of psychological distress that they might be seeing in other students,” Jasser said. “Some different examples of that could be different changes over time — if someone has significant changes in their mood or 
they change their appearance significantly.”The program also instructs students on how to talk to a 
struggling peer so they can better identify the problem and 
direct them to get proper help, Jasser said.
The faculty training addresses such issues with students 
and teaches faculty how to recognize the key signs of mental distress, she said.
Kognito can be accessed through the Counseling and Well-
ness Center’s website anytime, from any computer. The free program takes about 25 to 30 minutes to complete, Jasser said.
“Given everyone’s busy schedules, it is great that one can learn about helping others where and when it is convenient for them,” said Gizem Toska, licensed psychologist and as-sistant director of outreach and consultation at the wellness center.
As more students and faculty members are trained about 
this matter, at-risk students could feel less isolated and more connected, Toska said.
“Our goal through Kognito is to get students and faculty 
to take an active part in identifying at-risk students, address-
ing their concerns and motivating them to get help,” Toska 
said. “In a way, it is less about decreasing the numbers need-ing counseling but more about making sure those who need help get helped.”
Toska said the program does not need to be completed all 
at once, but doing so is encouraged.
“This is a great way for UF members to support one an-
other and to add to our sense of community, meaning and connection,” Toska said.Online program trains students, faculty to identify distress

A war on the Web may seem 
harmless: no blood, no sweat, no 
tears. Yet, when malware can infil-trate and dismantle a nuclear facil-ity in Iran from thousands of miles 
away, a whole new battlefield has 
opened for combat.
With cyberwarfare becoming a 
growing threat to the world, a new course starting in Spring 2014 will teach Gators how to take charge.
UF assistant professor in com-
puter science and engineering Jo-seph N. Wilson will lecture the new 
special topics computer science 
course called Malware Reverse En-gineering.
“Students are going to learn 
how to look at code that potentially could be harmful and figure out what it does,” he said.Computer security researchers 
treat malware as if it were a hu-man virus; they want to identify its source and figure out ways it is evolving, he said. 
Student Technology Fee funds 
will help purchase new hardware allowing students to analyze codes by accessing virtual networks — of-fline, of course, he said. 
“Rule No. 1 is 
never run mal-ware live on the Internet,” Wil-son said.
Marcus Ball, 
a 20-year-old UF computer sci-ence junior, said knowing how to 
diagnose malware is crucial in to-day’s society.

A workout tour inspired by the Miami club 
scene is encouraging local women to twerk 
out.
The Vixen Workout School of Ratchet Tour 
is bringing an hour-long workout to Simons nightclub Friday from 7 to 8 p.m. The class is available to women 18 and older for $15.
Janet Jones, former Miami Heat dancer and 
one of the instructors, said the purpose of the workout — which involves twerking — is to help women feel sexy and strong.
“It’s not your typical workout,” she said. 
“We want them to come with their hair down and makeup on so they get the feeling they are actually performing live on stage.”
Participants are encouraged to wear leg-
gings or sweatpants and sneakers — particu-larly wedge sneakers, Jones said.
Prior to the class, Jones and other Vixen 
Workout dance instructors will hold auditions for dance instructors for a planned Gainesville studio. The auditions will be held at 3 p.m. Fri-day at Simons.
Emily Ferradaz, a 19-year-old UF biomedi-
cal engineering sophomore who attended the Vixen Workout classes in Miami, said the class-es are empowering.
“It’s where any classy woman can go and act 
‘ratchet,’ so they don’t get judged in public,” said Ferradaz.
The workout tour begins Oct. 16 in Boca Ra-
ton and will also visit Tampa, Orlando and Tal-lahassee. Advance tickets are available online at vixenworkout.wantickets.com.Twerkout tour stopping by SimonsInnovation Hub is 
on track to expand
before you can continue develop-
ment,” Poppell said. “We contrib-uted the land, and (the city) agreed to build them.”
The roads, funded by the city, 
are an investment to increase the tax base and turn the former hos-pital grounds into a place where students and industries can come together.
“The benefits that Gainesville 
has that makes it competitive and draws businesses is its high qual-ity of life and a major university to draw from,” Poppell said.
Getting a space inside the Hub 
is competitive, said Jane Muir, di-rector of the Innovation Hub. There are a number of ways a startup will find its way into the Hub. Some come from companies 
that have been founded by stu-dents or graduates, and others are from companies that have licensed discoveries coming out of the uni-versity, Muir said.
With the Hub 
reaching about 90 percent capac-ity in just over two years, the program is on track to expand.
After the 
roads are com-
pleted, Muir said, she hopes to construct more buildings to accom-modate more space for incubating businesses in Gainesville.
Apartments, dry cleaners, res-
taurants, grocery stores and other businesses could also be future tenants in the area of the district.

Happy ﬁ  fth birthday, single 
ladies.
Beyoncé fans Brandon Robin-
son and Amanda Hanono, both 
20, and Maggie Kreuzkamp, 18, 
took over Turlington Plaza to 
perform the dance celebrating the ﬁ  fth anniversary of the singer’s iconic music video, “Single La-dies (Put A Ring on It).”
The trio, decked out in black 
spandex, performed twice on Monday: once at 11:35 a.m. and again at about 12:35 p.m. dur-
ing class exchanges. Kreuzkamp 
couldn’t make it to the second performance because of class.
The group rehearsed a few 
hours a week for ﬁ  ve weeks to nail down the “J-Setting” choreogra-phy, when one dancer moves and the other follows, as portrayed in the video.“Trying to recreate something 
is so hard because you don’t want to butcher it,” said Hanono, a UF psychology senior.
Robinson, a UF marketing ju-
nior who also teaches Zumba and hip-hop ﬁ  tness classes at South-west Recreation Center, stole the show as he role-played Beyoncé.
“It’s one of the most cinemati-
cally, choreographically, visually pleasing videos of all time,” Rob-inson said. “This video has actu-ally changed my life.”
A crowd gathered around the 
pair, and their accurate perfor-mance was met with jeers, ap-plause and video recordings.
UF aerospace and mechanical 
engineering sophomore Amanda Holly, 19, stopped in between classes to watch the performance.
“It’s great that people on cam-

� GUS WOODRUFF HAS RUN MR. 
GOODBIKE SINCE 2003.
EVAN ECHAVE
Alligator Contributing Writer
Mr. Goodbike is celebrating its 10-year an-
niversary of service and contribution to the 
Gainesville community this year.
Mr. Goodbike’s owner, 48-year-old Gus 
Woodruff, has been running the shop since its 
ﬁ  rst day. A self-described avid cyclist, Wood-
ruff worked for other bike shops in town until he decided to open Mr. Goodbike, located at 425 NW 13th St.
“I intended to just run a grassroots shop 
and treat people right,” Woodruff said. His intentions carried over into the store motto, which assures that they offer “nothing fancy, just good bikes and good service.”
“There are a lot of bike shops in town,” 
Woodruff said. “You’ve got to ﬁ  nd your niche.”
The store experienced rapid growth within 
the ﬁ  rst few years and was able to overcome some hefty obstacles along the way. One of the most difﬁ  cult times for the shop was just after hurricanes Frances and Jeanne blasted through Gainesville in 2004, only one year af-ter the start of business.
Mr. Goodbike’s building looks like a 1970s 
gas station that’s stood still in time and now displays, sells and ﬁ  xes bicycles of all types. 
Woodruff may be the owner, but he also 
acts as the shop’s landscaper, accounting for every rock and blade of grass on the prop-erty.
“It’s cool to ﬂ  ip the script,” he said. “Take

A CEO’s advice
DreamWorks CEO Stacey Snider talked to The Atlan-
tic yesterday in a video segment titled “Advice to a Younger Me” about her climb from an entry-level 
position in the entertainment industry to chairwoman of Universal Pictures to her current position as CEO. 
She went from being assigned to pick up $50,000 worth 
of gold chains for Mr. T to overseeing the production of blockbusters such as “Lincoln,” “Lost in Translation,” “A Beautiful Mind,” the “Bourne” series and “Erin Brockovich” — to name just a few titles. Now, she is partner alongside Steven Spielberg and is considered the reason for Univer-sal’s comeback within the movie industry in 2001.  
“The ﬁ  rst job is easy if you’re willing to check your ego 
at the door,” she said in the video interview.
Although being Mr. T’s personal bling handler may 
sound way better than data crunching or managing social media for an entry-level job, at the time, Snider had earned degrees from the University of Pennsylvania and UCLA’s law school. None of those prepared her for working in a mailroom. 
“I have always felt that my career was not going to be 
a straight shot up, but more of a kind of rolling wave, so that I could raise my children,” Snider told The Atlantic. 
“So I got pregnant when I was the head of production at a 
studio, and I became chairperson at a bigger studio when I was pregnant with my second daughter. You just do it!”
It took time for her to realize this, however. According to a New York Times article from 2001 fol-
lowing her promotion to chairwoman of Universal, she interned at a Manhattan law ﬁ  rm and hated the work. Dur-ing her twenties, she married and divorced twice. 
The takeaway from her interview with The Atlantic is, 
essentially, for young people entering the workforce to calm down. 
Success comes in waves, and it’s by no means a straight 
shot upward — especially for women who wish to have children. 
While college students are faced with a dizzying amount 
of career and life advice — especially women, who have to deal with zeitgeisty phrases about “leaning in” and “hav-ing it all” — it’s nice to hear something so straightforward: 
Check your pride and “just do it.” 
As Snider discussed, having a college education, and 
even an Ivy-League education like hers, doesn’t automati-
cally guarantee you a desk job. 
Sometimes you’ll be faced with impossible tasks: Snider, 
for example, was once told to ﬁ  nd Marlon Brando’s phone number in Tahiti. 
“You just have to gulp and wait until the agent leaves,” 
she said. “Then say ‘WTF,’ and you do it.”
“You can’t do everything, at the same time, always, and 
forever,” she said, “but if you look at your life and your career as a long, winding river, you can get to your desti-nation.”

that UF has no registered sex offenders?Today’s question: Have you ever twerked?It’s too early to determine Pope’s impact
Many would consider America to be one of the 
most religious countries on Earth. 
But despite that claim, more and more people 
are turning away from organized religion. Young people 
especially feel religion has become too out of touch with modern society.
The stories about religion that ﬁ  ll newspapers and 
airtime include depictions of individuals declaring holy 
war on behalf of God, accounts of clerical pedophilia 
and institutional corruption.    
On March 13, the world witnessed a humble man 
from South America step onto the world stage. Because 
of his new position, Pope Francis has the ability to shift 
the public perception of religion in our modern society.
Instead of issuing a new papal bull or establish-
ing a new church teaching as one of his ﬁ  rst actions as pontiff, Francis paid for the hotel bill where he stayed 
during the papal elections. The man with an incredible 
amount of inﬂ  uence in the world has been gaining re-spect through small actions. Such small actions include wearing more modest papal garments, washing the feet of inmates, reaching out to the poor and members of 
different religions and opting for a different “popemo-
bile.” 
Pope Francis has preached about caring for the poor, 
treating others as you wish to be treated and, most im-
portantly, peace. 
These are the things religion should be all about.
Many on the political left enjoyed the Pope’s off-
the-cuff comments on homosexuality, women having 
an expanded role in the church and allowing priests to 
marry. 
Many on the political right enjoyed his stance against 
abortion and his belief in the sacredness of life. 
Many who claim no religious afﬁ  liation enjoy the 
style and substance of the new head of the Catholic Church. Pope Francis seems to be 
saying the right things to the right people at the right time.
Francis was elected to clean 
up after the mess that was Pope Benedict’s papacy — a papacy full of indictments of clerical 
pedophilia and the mishandling 
of church ﬁ  nances. Though 
Francis’ predecessor was an authority on church teach-ing and history, he lacked the leadership skills neces-sary to control the senior members of the Vatican and 
the communication skills necessary to relate to the aver-
age person.  
However, as time goes on and when the rubber meets 
the road, the Pope will have to take strong stances on 
many issues. 
While his off-the-cuff moments were great talking 
points, they carry little weight because no actions have 
been taken on such issues. For example, no concrete ac-tion has been taken on women in the priesthood.
And though the perception of the Catholic Church 
has arguably been more positive as of late, actual church teachings and practices haven’t changed.
While some will say the church’s more liberal stance 
on some social issues is a step in the right direction, it’s not enough. If the Pope is as serious as many say he is on making the church a more inclusive place, proper ac-tion must be taken to ensure that happens.  
The real impact of Francis’ papacy lies ahead. It’s up 
to him to determine how he is going to shape the church and the face of religion in modern times. 
What we have seen so far is what kind of man Pope 
Francis is; what we have to see in the future is what 
kind of ﬁ  gure in history Pope Francis will become.

David Coleman was 
named the new presi-dent of the College 
Board last summer and, thanks to him, the board is debuting 
a reconstructed SAT in 2015. 
The SAT has long been a poor excuse for a college-readiness exam. This is especially true of the essay section, which came under heavy ﬁ  re at a Septem-ber press conference ﬁ  lled with high school and university fac-ulty from across the country. 
They told Coleman in no un-
certain terms how detrimental the essay portion has become for students. For the ﬁ  rst time, the College Board is listening.
In his article aptly titled “We 
Are Teaching High School Stu-dents to Write Terribly,” Slate.com’s Matthew Malady details 
how the SAT-essay-grading 
system rewards students for fabricating experiences instead of supporting their work with facts, which is the basis of a college composition.
One professor interviewed 
for the article stated there is “no concern about factual ac-
curacy.” Another claimed that 
the SAT serves only to give students “a diminished view of what writing is.” The most forward of the bunch said this exam, which should be about testing command over lan-guage, is merely rewarding “the ability to bulls**t on de-
mand.”
When testing, students get 
25 minutes to plan an essay but 
no extra paper. They respond to vague, FCAT-like prompts by throwing up words, half of them about fake experiences. During grading, readers must meet a daily quota and essays 
go past them conveyer-belt 
style. Taking more than three minutes to score a paper gets them booted from the job. Reading more than 30 essays in an hour, two minutes or less per essay, and they earn a bo-nus.
The grading system means 
there is no time to fact-check, so the prose becomes all-im-portant. Stufﬁ  ng it with upper-register vocabulary looks im-pressive as readers skim past the context which, if it was read, would reveal its writer had no idea what “obstreper-ous” actually means. Of course, 
ﬁ  ve-paragraph style is a given. 
Anything else and graders have to pause and consider structure, which steals points automatically.
English teachers, even in 
AP courses, have to spend time teaching this formula. First comes the hook, then the the-
sis, three body paragraphs, a 
conclusion and, for God’s sake, end it on a profound note. A personal favorite? Never cross 
two T’s in one stroke; the writ-
ing looks rushed, which im-plies insecurity. All these tricks and tactics may boost the score but serve no purpose outside the testing room. With high pressure from schools, peers and parents to achieve a high pass rate, it must be done. Un-
fortunately, time spent on test 
prep detracts from learning the truly applicable lessons.
However, AP essay ques-
tions trump the SAT’s in that they require facts — which will be checked — and often include critical analysis or document synthesis. These 
come closer to representing 
university-level writing, which 
asks the student to mesh out-
side sources to support origi-
nal arguments. Meanwhile the SAT says, “Screw the facts, kid, you’re a credible source all your own.”
What SAT prep teaches stu-
dents is regurgitation, which in any form yields an unoriginal and unenjoyable result.
True command of the Eng-
lish language means having a veritable arsenal of strategies for any writing situation. It does not mean students plung-ing two ﬁ  ngers into the back of their throats to spew nonsense and thesaurus words onto un-suspecting paper. The SAT and 
its lessons in spinning great 
tales are overdue for a facelift. For something dubbed a “col-lege readiness assessment,” it couldn’t be farther from it. To-day we thank the testing gods for David Coleman and look forward to when students get a taste of real writing.
Critical analysis teaches us 
to spot patterns and dissect 
the nuances of others’ verbal 
and written communications. 
A holistic writing education al-lows us to articulate a point in a graceful and novel way. Writ-ing should be about producing a concrete communication, one with merit that can stand alone. These are important life skills. If we are to inhabit and 
decipher the world around 
us — our context — we have to stop teaching students to bulls**t their way to success.

opinions@alligator.orgAs a mathematician-cum-philoso-
pher-cum-social critic who pub-lished 66 books and more than 
2,000 essays, Bertrand Russell was totally unqualiﬁ  ed to promote leisure at the ex-pense of work. But in a 1935 article for Harper’s Weekly titled “In Praise of Idleness,” that’s exactly what he did, and by many accounts he was quite successful.
The nuts and bolts of his thesis were bold: The 
workday should be capped at four hours. Increases in productivity should lead not just to increases in con-sumption, but also to more time off; instead of orga-nizing our lives around our jobs, we should organize them around the activities that matter most to us — activities which rarely include laboring in a factory or an exurban ofﬁ  ce park.
From a modern perspective, “In Praise of Idle-
ness” comes off as a bit utopian — submit an essay to Harper’s calling for a four-hour workday now, and you’ll have nothing to show for it but a rejection slip.
But the wonderful thing about utopian viewpoints 
is that by showing us an alternate world totally in bal-ance, they also show all that’s out of balance with our reality. In Russell’s worldview, the West — especially the United States — was so obsessed with working, with employment, with thrift, that any activity not re-lated to our jobs was considered unacceptably frivo-lous. Humanistic study was shunned, self-cultivation was deemed unimportant, and political dialogue cen-tered on getting citizens to work, but never touched upon getting them some time off.
Russell detailed many causes and symptoms of 
this work-obsessed cultural worldview in his essay. Like almost all of Russell’s writings, the structure and syntax of the piece is crystal clear, but unlike many of his writings — which were stubborn children of early twentieth century Britain  — the observations and ar-guments of “In Praise of Idleness” are as instructive in 2013 as they were when ﬁ  rst published.
In terms of our entertainment, even Bertrand 
would be shocked at just how passive and sluggish we’ve become.
According to a recent survey by Nielsen, the aver-
age American over the age of two watches 34 hours of television per week. The Bureau of Labor Statistics — using the somewhat suspect method of simply asking respondents — came up with the much more modest ﬁ  gure of 2.8 hours a day. Still, that was sufﬁ  cient to account for the bulk of the average American’s leisure time, dwarﬁ  ng activities like reading (18 minutes per day) and “socializing or communicating” (37 minutes per day).
To sum it all up, despite America’s con-
stantly ballooning GDP, we can’t wrench ourselves away from our desks and assem-bly lines. We’re still subjected to traumatiz-
ing recessionary bubbles in which we’re unemployed or working our asses off to remain employed. We’ve pretty much ditched the idea of self-cultivation for its own sake, and, collectively, we spend more time watching a few popular television shows than we do pawing through novels and magazines.
If Russell’s observations weren’t true in 1935, they 
certainly are now.
Russell did offer a solution to this predicament, but, 
as already mentioned, he was a utopian. He wrote in his 1935 essay, “The Case for Socialism,” that a demo-cratic, non-Marxian, socialist regime, arising with the slow passage of time, would be able to institute his four-hour workday without a descent into penury. His idea is characteristically bold, and such a regime might work, but it won’t arise in our lifetimes, so for now we’ll have to look for solutions elsewhere.
One source would be Western Europe where a 
number of countries have managed to foster leisure, without dismantling capitalism — and the innovation that comes along with it — as Russell would have as do.
At the moment, Americans aren’t mulling the vir-
tues of this European-style leisure. As we’re recover-ing from a period of economic malaise, citizens and politicians alike have emphasized the need for hard work and thrift. But we ignore that fact that our pro-duction grows more efﬁ  cient by the year — that this growth in productivity was especially pronounced during the Great Recession. Whatever the roots of our economic anxieties, simply working more and more won’t soothe them.
Russell said Americans were uniquely adverse to 
leisure; it appears he was telling the truth. For centu-ries we’ve deiﬁ  ed the honest hard-worker — whether he be the yeoman farmer or the cunning industrialist. When this attitude shows its downsides, as it has in the last few years, we cling to it with more ferocity than ever before. Perhaps — in an era dominated by a never-declining workday, universal pre-profes-sionalism, and extreme anxiety among both the un-employed and employed — it’s ﬁ  nally time to recon-sider.

UF was awarded roughly $1.7 
million last week after the Board of 
Governors authorized the release of Florida’s performance funding.
A total of $20 million was div-
vied up between 11 Florida public universities based on three criteria; percent of graduates with bach-elor’s degrees employed and/or continuing their education one year after graduation; median average full-time wages of undergraduates employed in Florida one year after graduation; average cost per under-graduate to the institution.
Universities were ranked zero to 
three for each metric. 
UF’s cut was 9 percent of the $20 
million, coming in at $1,739,130. The University of Central Florida and University of South Florida received the largest portions of the funds, scoring the highest on the bench-marks and receiving $2,608,696 each.
UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes  
said the caveat with the benchmarks is that its measurements apply only to Florida. Students who might have graduated and moved out of state weren’t counted.
“The bottom line is our students do get jobs, just not all of them in the state of Florida,” she said.
She said the Board of Governors 
is looking at expanding the metrics for next year.
Joe Glover, UF provost, said the 
money hasn’t been designated a purpose yet.
“It will eventually be allocated 
by the president and me,” he said. “Frankly, we haven’t even turned our attention to it yet.”
He said the metrics used by the 
Board of Governors were restrictive, 
and part of why UF wasn’t awarded 
more money is that the data itself wasn’t good.
For now, UF is focused on work-
ing with its $15 million in preemi-nence funding, he said.UF receives $1.7M in performance funding from government � TWENTY INCIDENT

A resident’s recent com-
plaint about plumbing at the 
Village Crossing apartment complex could point to larger issues of enforcing law and 
lease agreements at properties. 
Last week, Commissioner 
Yvonne Hinson-Rawls re-
sponded to a complaint from a resident at the complex. The resident said he was spoken to in an “undignified manner” and that management was “us-ing profanity” toward him, 
Hinson-Rawls said.
Property manager Nicole 
Larson said the complaint came 
from a resident whose plumb-ing issues required him to be without a restroom for about three hours. He became upset when she could not provide him with monetary compensa-
tion.
“(The resident) told Com-
missioner Rawls that we were 
denying him access to his toilet and not being compliant with code enforcement,” Larson said. “Code enforcement came out and found nothing wrong.”
Larson said the two plumb-
ers she called could not fix the problem, so she had to call a hydro-rooter service to unclog the plumbing. But the resident was still unhappy he wasn’t compensated otherwise.
“I can’t give him a conces-
sion,” she said. “A business can’t pay out unless it’s to an-
other business.”
Larson said the resident had 
made a statement that she had been oppressive toward him.
Hinson-Rawls said other 
complaints against the complex 
have added up, citing resident concerns about management changing rules, using profanity and threatening eviction to resi-
dents who accrue citations.
Larson attributes the com-
plaints and the resistance to 
her strict enforcement of lease agreements. The location of the complex contributes to the “high level of criminal activity,” and despite efforts to try to en-force rules to deter the criminal 
element, Larson has been met 
with resistance from residents, she wrote in an email.
“The overall feeling of the 
property is negative,” she said. “All I have done is enforce these rules … but I have been met with a huge amount of re-sistance here. ”
Larson said because she is 
proactive, crimes such as ag-gravated assault and robbery have gone down, but trespass-ing charges have gone up.
“I’m proactive for trespass-
ing, so there’s a higher call volume,” she said. “But we are seeing a decline in the level of 
crime.”
Gainesville Police spokes-
man Officer Ben Tobias said of 
the 20 incident reports written since Aug. 1, most have been for trespassing, with only a few other charges including domes-tic disturbances. 
Hinson-Rawls said Larson, 
who has managed other low-income properties before, may simply be overwhelmed with requests at Village Crossing.
“I do believe the constituent 
was correct, and they shouldn’t have to live in a police state or an oppressed state,” she said. “I think she’s (Larson) having a 
lot of issues there and is finding 
herself in a Catch-22.”Village Crossing

The Alachua County Fire Rescue reopened Fire Sta-
tion 19 on Friday after remedying a mold issue.
The building was closed temporarily on Oct. 7 to 
“remediate mold that was discovered in the station,” ac-
cording to a Gainesville Fire Rescue news release.
Mark Sexton, the Alachua County communications 
coordinator, confirmed that the station at 1800 SW 43rd St. is now “fully operational.”
Sexton said the black mold that plagued the station 
has now been cleared up.
Bill Northcutt, deputy chief of Alachua County Fire 
Rescue, said even though some of the construction is continuing, the staff has moved back into the station permanently.
“Some of the construction is still going on in the 
bunk room, so we moved the living arrangements to the front (of the station),” he said. “They’re living there full-time.”
Northcutt said he was glad the process didn’t take 
long because the firefighters initially didn’t plan on leav-ing the station. 
But while dealing with the root of the problem — the 
air conditioning vents — they saw the issue was more extensive than they’d realized.
“We thought it was isolated to a small area,” he said. 
“But once they started … we realized it was a much big-ger problem, and we had to evacuate last minute.”
ACFR relocated Rescue 19 to Alachua County Fire 
Station 15 at Southwest 88th Street and relocated Engine 19 to Alachua County Fire Station 16 on Ft. Clarke Bou-levard, according to the release.
Because the relocation caused a gap in coverage, ac-
cording to the release, Gainesville Fire Rescue relocated Engine 2 to the Station 19 service area.
City Commissioner Thomas Hawkins said the re-
sponse to the situation was unusual, but local govern-ment did its best to keep safety up and costs down.
“Our goal is to make sure both Gainesville residents 
and Alachua County residents are safe. That’s our first and most important goal,” he said. “We wanted to do it in a way that’s affordable and will equitably distrib-ute the cost between Gainesville taxpayers and Alachua County taxpayers.”Fire station reopens after mold cleanup

A local artist seeking to develop a new 
sculpture park in the heart of Gainesville is 
hoping to receive funds from the city.
James Lasley, a sculpture artist, came up 
with the idea of installing public art around 
Gainesville from similar projects in cities 
such as DeLand, Kissimmee and Palatka. 
The only difference is the displays would be temporary, unlike in other counties.
Lasley will present his idea to the City 
Commission today. He said he believes city commissioners would be open to the idea because temporary art pieces are more eas-ily managed.
“In a city management point of view, 
there would be no headaches having to constantly maintain the sculptures as new artwork would be replaced every year,” he said.Participating artists would receive about 
$1,000 for their artwork, and the city would 
not have to pay hefty fees to install perma-nent platforms, he added.
William J. Eyerly, executive director of 
Gainesville Association of the Creative Arts, 
said a sculpture park could be a positive op-portunity for locals.
“Children, adults and families able to en-
joy and critique pieces of art in any form is a great idea,” Eyerly said. “The more arts we can get, the more we can beneﬁ  t as a com-munity.” Temporary outdoor art exhibits suggested for Gainesville

The number of people who 
tweet suicidal sentiments may 
be linked with the number of 
suicides recorded in some states, 
a recent study suggests.
The study, which was con-
ducted by Brigham Young Uni-
versity, analyzed keywords on 
Twitter by state and compared the data to the state’s recorded suicide rate. 
It found the two numbers 
were similar in some cases.
At UF, Mercedes Machado is 
all too familiar with the pain as-sociated with suicide. 
At the age of 17, she lost her 
close friend to it.
“I experienced and saw the 
pain,” said Machado, now a 23-year-old UF second-year 
counselor education graduate 
student.
Machado works with a UF 
suicide prevention program 
directed at students. She said 
Twitter could be used as a re-source to monitor suicidal be-havior. She said it can also be used 
as a way to respond to suicidal tweets with helpful resources.
Machado said even Tweets 
considered “emotional” can be 
a cry for help from a person 
looking for someone to reach out to them.
Donovan Triplett, a 21-year-
old UF advertising senior, said he uses Twitter to promote his organizations, connect with friends and express himself. 
He said drawing data from 
the tweets could be tricky.
“The words and phrases 
used to identify suicidal tweets and discussions would need to be very clear,” Triplett said. “Or else certain tweets could be tak-
en out of context.”
Meggen Sixbey, associate 
director of emergency and cri-
sis response services at UF’s 
Counseling & Wellness Center, 
expressed concern about the reaction to online activity moni-
toring. 
“It’s a slippery slope because 
it’s a public forum,” said Sixbey, 
who also coordinates UF’s crisis response and suicide preven-tion program. “This can cause a knee-jerk reaction that won’t always lead to the appropriate resources being used.”
UF social media specialist 
Bruce Floyd said people use social media platforms to share both the positive and negative events that happen throughout 
their day.
“I’m not surprised those con-
versations happen on Twitter,” 
Floyd said. “It’s a communica-tion platform for real people 
who feel real emotions.”Study ﬁ  nds certain tweets could 
mirror suicide rates in some states“The more arts we can get, 
the more we can beneﬁ  t as a

  Matt Jones is out for the season 
after suffering a torn meniscus in 
his left knee during the ﬁ  rst half 
of Florida’s 17-6 loss to LSU on 
Saturday.
  A disappointing start to the 
season is now a disaster for the 
sophomore running back, who 
underwent surgery Monday to repair the damage.
  Jones is not eligible to receive 
a medical redshirt because the 
injury occurred so late in the 
season. He will likely be at full strength for the start of spring practice.
  “I hate it for Matt,” said coach 
Will Muschamp, who initially be-lieved the injury was a sprained knee. 
“He’s a great young man. 
To go through what he’s been through this fall … and then to have this setback, is just disheart-
ening for all of us.”
  Jones’ injury ends a season 
that never truly got started. Af-
ter serving as Florida’s primary 
back-up running back last sea-
son, the Seffner native expected to become the focal point of the Gators’ offense.
  However, that plan began to 
unravel before the start of the season.
  Jones suffered a severe viral infection in July that left him hos-
pitalized for more than a week. 
The infection caused him to 
lose about 10 pounds and miss all 
of training camp.
  The effects of the illness bled 
into the season. 
Jones missed Florida’s season 
opener against Toledo on Aug. 31. He returned a week later to 
face Miami but was not at full 
strength, fumbling during the ﬁ  rst quarter and proving to be ineffective in a 21-16 loss to the 
Hurricanes.
  Jones improved after his slow 
start and showed ﬂ  ashes of po-
tential. 
He rushed for a career-high 
176 yards on 28 carries against Kentucky and currently ranks 11th in the Southeastern Con-ference with an average of 67.8 
rushing yards per game.
  He carried the ball a total of 
79 times for 339 yards and two 
touchdowns during ﬁ  ve games 
this season.
  “Again, man down, man up,” 
Muschamp said. “We’ll get the next guy up.”
  Muschamp has repeated that 
sentiment an alarming number of 
times already. 
  Jones is the seventh player on 
Florida’s roster to be lost for the season. 
He joins Jeff Driskel (leg), Do-
minique Easley (knee), Andre De-bose (knee), Chaz Green (shoul-der), Nick Washington (shoulder) 
and Matt Rolin (knee) as players 
who have suffered season-ending injuries.
  Florida now turns to redshirt junior Mack Brown and freshman Kelvin Taylor to shoulder the 
load in the running game. Val-
dez Showers could also see an in-creased role out of the backﬁ  eld, Muschamp said.
  Brown ﬁ  lled in for Jones 
against Toledo and ran for 112 yards and two touchdowns. 
In six games this season, 
Brown is averaging 3.7 yards per 
carry.
  Taylor provides another alter-
native for the Gators at tailback. 
After entering Saturday’s game against LSU with just six carries all season, the four-star recruit 
rushed 10 times for 52 yards and 
helped spark an otherwise dor-mant Florida offense.
  With Jones out of the picture, 
Taylor could be in line for a larg-
er role in the offense.
  “He deserved the opportu-
nity,” Muschamp said of Taylor. 
“Regardless of the injury, he was 
going to play in the game more 
than he had previous to this game. Obviously, the injury ac-celerated that.”

 I  believe “To Kill a Mockingbird” is one of the few nov-
els you’re forced to read in high school that you don’t actually hate. I’ve read Harper Lee’s lone novel sev-
eral times since.
  (I also love the 1962 movie with Gregory Peck, but I 
digress.)
  Aside from the whole lawyer thing, I want to be At-
ticus Finch when I grow up — a smart, reasonable guy who’s right as rain and strong in his convictions.
  Lord knows I’ll never be as awesome as Atticus, but I 
like to apply his (read: Lee’s) wisdom often. It gives me something to aspire to, no matter how much I fail to reach 
it.
  So when Will Muschamp announced Monday that run-
ning back Matt Jones was Florida’s ﬁ  fth ﬁ  rst-string player 
to suffer a season-ending injury, I thought of Atticus.
  (Yeah, I know. I’m weird.)  In Chapter 11, he imparts some wisdom to his children, Scout and Jem, on basically ﬁ  ght-ing the good ﬁ  ght. It’s a bit out of context considering the jarring dif-
ference between the novel’s plot 
and football, but the theme is both sound and pertinent.
  “[Courage is] when you know 
you’re licked before you begin, but 
you begin anyway and see it through no matter what,” Atticus says.
  At this juncture, Florida is pretty licked. Losing Domi-
nique Easley, Jeff Driskel and Jones in the span of three 
weeks is, I imagine, the very deﬁ  nition. Instability on spe-
cial teams and an offense still struggling to ﬁ  nd its footing don’t help.
  But there is still everything to play for. Florida still con-
trols its own destiny in the Southeastern Conference East-ern Division. Everything is still in play for the Gators.  Atlanta is still very much in sight. And Muschamp is 
not backing down from that goal, touting it any and every opportunity he gets. I applaud him for that.
  But frankly, it’s quite an uphill battle.  Healthier teams in South Carolina, Georgia and Mis-
souri are still in contention. Also, Florida has crumbled in two road games this season, and it plays all three afore-
mentioned divisional rivals away from Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n 
Stadium.
  The task is daunting. It would be easy to just throw his 
hands up behind closed doors and say, “Screw it. Let’s just stay healthy and ﬁ  nish strong.”
  But Muschamp makes it clear that he always expects 
excellence regardless of the circumstances. He put himself out there by hammering the Atlanta narrative home so often in recent days.
  Muschamp’s licked right now, but he’s a brave guy. Muschamp’s leadership will help embattled UF ﬁ  ght on

  Kyle Christy went from being a 
preseason All-American to inside 
Will Muschamp’s doghouse.
  Now, it does not look like he is 
coming out any time soon.
  The junior punter has lost his 
starting job to freshman Johnny Townsend, Muschamp announced Monday. Christy, who led the Southeastern Conference in punt-ing last season, is ranked 10th in 2013.
  “We need to make a change,” 
Muschamp said. “We’ve been 
very inconsistent punting the ball 
throughout the season.”
  Christy has had a puzzling 
start to his second full season as a starter. He was a key contributor to an 11-2 team that dominated the ﬁ  eld-position battle in top-10 wins against No. 4 LSU and No. 7 South Carolina in 2012.
  Now, he is struggling with both 
distance and placement. Christy botched two opportunities to pin the Tigers deep in their own terri-tory on Saturday, which drew the ire of Muschamp and special teams coordinator Jeff Choate. 
  Christy’s struggles may be men-
tal as much as anything. A second-
team All-American and Ray Guy 
Award ﬁ  nalist, he set the program record in average punt distance last season before regressing this year.
  Correcting his issues has been 
a joint effort from Christy and the Florida coaching staff to improve his technique, ball placement and leg swing, but Muschamp has grown tired of waiting for im-proved results. 
  Townsend is the second special-
ist to earn a starting job. 
  Walk-on Francisco Velez drilled 
two ﬁ  eld goals against LSU, replac-ing redshirt freshman Austin Har-din as UF’s starting kicker.
  “We’ll move forward with the 
guys that perform the best,” Mus-champ said. 
Powell dealing with injury: 
Ronald Powell suffered an ankle injury against LSU but is expected to return to practice by Wednes-day.
The redshirt junior, who missed 
all of 2012 after suffering a torn ACL prior to the season, leads Flor-ida with seven quarterback hurries 
and is second with two sacks.
“I hope to know more in the next 
72 hours and see how the swelling 
goes,” Muschamp said.
  Shaky run defense raises ques-
tions: Zach Mettenberger is not shy about rufﬂ  ing feathers. The senior quarterback pushed Buck line-backer Dante Fowler Jr. following LSU’s ﬁ  rst touchdown. 
He also had this to say after the 
win: “There was a lot of talking leading up to this game. We just wanted to remind Florida who we were, and I think the offensive line really played great.”
  A 121-yard rushing perfor-
mance from sophomore Jeremy 
Hill gave Florida a stark reminder. 
Hill averaged 5.8 yards a carry on ﬁ  rst down. 
    “Rushing defense is something 
we take pride in, and coach Mus-champ deﬁ  nitely speaks on it ev-ery game: We’re going to stop the run,” safety Jaylen Watkins said. “The past few weeks, I wouldn’t 
say that we did a good job of stop-
ping the run.” 
Nothing easy about injuries: 
ESPN radio host Dan Le Batard asked Georgia coach Mark Richt a question last week during an on-air segment: What do you hate most about your job?
 Richt responded with a simple, 
yet poignant, answer: He does not enjoy seeing players writhing on the ﬁ  eld in pain knowing their sea-sons are over. 
  No. 15 Georgia has seen its ros-
ter decimated by injuries. No. 22 Florida can relate.

With Week 6 of the NFL season in 
the books, here are a few former Gators 
who made the most tangible impact for their respective teams.
  Riley Cooper, wide receiver: A 
tumultuous offseason had many Philadelphia Eagles fans pleading for the dismissal of Cooper, but the wideout proved his worth to the team on Sunday. 
  In the Eagles’ 31-20 win against 
the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Coo-per recorded 120 yards on four re-ceptions and scored a touchdown. 
  The fourth-year receiver beat 
Bucs cornerback Johnthan Banks to catch a 47-yard strike in the left corner of the end zone, giving the Eagles a 21-17 lead with 11:41 re-maining in the third quarter. 
The pass came from quarter-
back Nick Foles, who ﬁ  lled in for Michael Vick (hamstring) on Sun-day.
    Carlos Dunlap, defensive end:
Dunlap has been on a tear to start 2013, and Sunday was one of his most impressive showings.
  The Cincinnati Bengals left de-
fensive end continued his strong play with a sack, a forced fumble, two tackles for loss and two quar-terback hits during his team’s 27-24 overtime victory against the 
Buffalo Bills.
  Dunlap’s sack came during 
quarterback Thad Lewis and the 
Bills’ ﬁ  nal drive of the fourth quarter, while his forced fumble in the third quarter led to a Bengals touchdown on the ensuing drive.
  Through six games, Dunlap has 
recorded 26 tackles, only 14 fewer 
than his 2012 total in 14 games, 
and has earned four sacks — tied for 18th most in the league. 
    Notes: During the Washington 
Redskins’ 31-16 loss to the Dal-las Cowboys on Sunday night, Washington tight end Jordan Reed proved to be one of Robert Grifﬁ  n III’s most reliable targets. 
Reed was second on the team with 
58 receiving yards on four recep-tions — including a 29-yard catch that set up a ﬁ  eld goal prior to halftime. 
  Baltimore Ravens free safety 
Matt Elam had eight tackles in a starting role Sunday. The rookie made a controversial low hit on 
Green Bay Packers wideout Ran-
dall Cobb, who was then carted off the ﬁ  eld with a knee injury, late in the second quarter.

 Alligator Writer @rjschaffer 
   The No. 2 Gators (17-1, 
6-0 Southeastern Conference) 
did more than collect their eighth and ninth consecutive 
sweeps last weekend.
They made a statement. 
  With three-set victories 
against No. 15 Kentucky on Friday and Georgia on Sun-
day, Florida proved it is the 
team to beat in the SEC. 
  “Friday night, a com-
plete performance and great 
win,” coach Mary Wise said. 
“Just by the quirkiness of 
the schedule, that’s the only 
time we play Georgia, and to ﬁ  nish that with a 3-0 win, (I) couldn’t ask for anything 
more.” 
  Florida is doing more than 
simply sweeping matches; it 
is suffocating opponents of-fensively and defensively.  
  The Gators neutralized 
the Wildcats’ star player, Whitney Billings, and held the team to a hitting percent-age of .188. Florida hit .372.
  UF was even more domi-
nant against Georgia.  
The Bulldogs scored more 
than 15 points in only the third set and hit .032 on the match. 
Three UGA players hit a 
negative percentage due to errors. 
  One of the biggest ques-
tions going into the season was how Wise would replace 
Tangerine Wiggs, who was 
third on the team in both hit-
ting percentage and kills last 
year. 
  Sophomore middle block-
er Simone Antwi and fresh-man right-side hitter Alex Holston have combined to 
provide the answer. 
  “Alex has the advantage 
on the right-side of being 
left-handed,” Wise said.  “In that position, there are balls 
that she’s getting that would 
be very difﬁ  cult for a right-
handed hitter, especially the 
out of system balls, to be able 
to kill.
  “In Simone’s case, she’s a 
prototype in terms of what 
has happened here. For Si-
mone, [sitting behind good 
players] was her ﬁ  rst two 
years here at Florida. When your turn comes, take full 
advantage of it, and she’s 
deﬁ  nitely doing that.” 
  The Gators have the lux-
ury of multiple players who can get double-digit kills — 
they had four players in dou-
ble ﬁ  gures Friday — putting 
them second in the nation in 
hitting percentage at .351.
  Florida travels to Missouri 
on Sunday to face the Tigers, 
who boast the nation’s best

   Michael Frazier experi-
enced few struggles as a fresh-
man last season.
  Frazier, who was named to 
the Southeastern Conference’s 
All-Freshman team, shot near-ly 50 percent from behind the three-point arc as a key reserve for the Gators.
  But as a member of the 
USA men’s U19 squad this summer, Frazier was forced to re-evaluate his play. Usually a dependable shooter, he made just 32.4 percent of his shots from the ﬂ  oor while playing in nine games at the FIBA U19 World Championships over-seas.
  Billy Donovan, who 
coached Frazier and the rest of Team USA to a gold medal in the Czech Republic, said Fra-zier needed a challenge dur-ing the summer to build his strength and conﬁ  dence.
  “He learned a lot about him-
self because he went through some adversity,” Donovan said. “It wasn’t like this thing where he came out there and shot the cover off the ball and just non-stop 60 percent three-point shooter. 
  “That was anything but the 
truth. He had to work through some adversity, and I think he handled it in a way that really helped him grow.”
  The 6-foot-4 guard from 
Tampa was one of 26 players invited to the USA U19 train-ing camp in June. He survived several rounds of cuts to earn one of the team’s 12 roster 
spots. 
  While the rest of his team-
mates shined during their 88-
29 victory against the Ivory 
Coast in the ﬁ  rst game of the 
tournament, Frazier shot a 
team-low 1 for 8, including 0 for 4 behind the arc.
  Only a couple of months re-
moved from a season when he 
sunk 46.8 percent of his threes, Frazier’s three-point shoot-ing percentage dipped to 29.4 while playing for Team USA.
  Frazier said the opportuni-
ty to face professional players at such a young age has given him more maturity on and off the court entering this season with the Gators.
  “Being able to play against 
pro talent, because those guys overseas are already playing pro, was probably the biggest 
thing, being able to compete 
on that level,” Frazier said. 
“I had to raise up all lev-
els of my game because I was playing with such high-tal-ented guys. In that kind of at-mosphere, playing with those kind of players, it forces you to raise up your game.”
  With Frazier having a year 
of college experience and a summer of international expe-rience under his belt, Donovan said he expects him to have a larger presence on the court during his sophomore year at UF.
  With Scottie Wilbekin still 
under suspension and the losses of Kenny Boynton, Erik Murphy and Mike Rosario to graduation, Frazier is ex-pected to get more minutes at  shooting guard. He could also see time at small forward.

He plugged his nose, held 
his breath and walked right into the you-know-what-
storm that Urban Meyer left 
behind.
  He called out the NCAA 
for suspending Sharrif Floyd 
in 2011, took Florida to task 
for being “soft” later that sea-son and never toned down his ferocity on the sidelines.
  He let kicker Francisco 
Velez make his college debut in LSU’s Death Valley of all places and will likely burn freshman punter Johnny 
Townsend’s redshirt to bench 
former Ray Guy Award ﬁ  nal-ist Kyle Christy.
  Rotten luck with injuries 
paints Florida’s season as es-
sentially over. Mathematical-
ly, they’re still in it, but the cards are certainly stacked like skyscrapers against the 
Gators.
  In the back of his mind, 
Muschamp hears those voic-
es. 
I’m sure he has even more 
doubts now that he has lost Jones. But he can’t get caught up in that. A trying 2011 taught him as much.
  Because as far as Mus-
champ is concerned, losing sight of what’s next — even in the face of a tough draw — would be a sin worse than 
killing a mockingbird. 16, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, OCTOBER 15, 2013
