Gators defense shuts down Tigers
By PHIL KEGLER
Alligator Staff Writer
pkegler@alligator org
BATON ROUGE, La. -For two
weeks, everyone waited to see if
Tim Tebow would play and how he
would respond against LSU under
the lights of Tiger Stadium.
Then Saturday night came, and
No. 15 played, but it was No. 51
who stole the spotlight.
Linebacker Brandon Spikes led
the team with 11 tackles and 2.5
sack -half the
team's total -as No.
1 Florida's defense
held then-No.4 LSU
Football to 162 yards, and
Tebow led a conser-
vative offense that
did just enough in a 13-3 victory in
front of a record crowd of 93,129.
Gators fans might want to call
ESPN College GameDay analyst
Kirk Herbstreit and thank him for
Spikes' performance. Herbstreit sin-
gled out Spikes and defensive end
Carlos Dunlap as two players who
would need to play big for Florida
(5-0, 3-0 Southeastern Conference)
to win.
Spikes was not available to the
media after the game, but he seemed
to give his response on the field.
Cornerback Joe Haden said UF

Locals react to Obama's Peace Prize
* HE RECEIVED THE PEACE PRIZE
FOR HIS DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS.
By ROBERT HARRINGER
Alligator Contributing Writer
Supporters and opponents around the
world were shocked to hear President Barack
Obamna won the Nobel Peace Prize Friday.
Even the president seemed caught off guard.
"I am both surprised and deeply humbled
by the decision of the Nobel Committee,"
Obama said in a speech after the announce-

on Saturday, two
weeks after suffer-
ing a concussion
against Kentucky.
He didn't dominate
but did enough to
lead UF to a win.
See Story, Page 13.ment.
He then said he knew the prize wasn't
given to him to honor a specific achievement,
but instead the prize reflects the kind of world
Americans want to build.
"That is why I will ac-International cept this award as a callNews to action," he said. "A call
for all nations to confront
the common challenges of the 21st century."
Norwegian Nobel Committee said in a
press release that it gave the award to Obama
"for his efforts to strengthen international di-
plomacy and cooperation between peoples."
"For 108 years, the Norwegian NobelCommittee has sought to stimulate precisely
that international policy and those attitudes
for which Obama is now the world's leading
spokesman," according to the release.
After the announcement, Arab organiza-
tions like Hamas and the Taliban along with
Iran's foreign minister denounced the com-
mittee's choice.
The criticism wasn't limited to foreign op-
ponents of the president. On his radio show
Friday, Rush Limbaugh said, "Our president
is a worldwide joke."

About 160,000 gallons of
water flooded Riker Hall on
Saturday after a sprinkler pipe
was broken on the third floor,
according to a statement re-
leased by Riker Hall staff.
"It was pretty loud actu-
ally. And my hypothesis
is that they hit one of
the sprinklers, and sud-
denly, I heard a splash
of water,"
Uri Ramirez
UF sophomore
Uri Ramirez, a UF sopho-
more who lives on the third
floor, said he was working on
his computer when he heard
some guys playing with what
sounded like a Nerf ball in the
corridor outside his room.
"It was pretty loud actually.
And my hypothesis is that they
hit one of the sprinklers, and
suddenly, I heard a splash of
water," Ramirez said.
Ramirez said the surge of
the water was loud. He opened
his door and saw a flood of wa-
ter coming down the hall.
The flood happened at
about 5:30 p.m. Everyone was
evacuated from the building.

Students strip down to their skivvies for charity run
By JOEY FLECHAS
Alligator Contributing Writer
Thick.
The atmosphere was thick and
swampy as people started to gather
on Turlington Plaza at about 11:30
p.m. Friday night for a brief mid-
night run.
As the minutes passed, throngs
of students arrived in waves. Some
came dressed in tank tops and ath-
letic shorts and some in blue jeans
and t-shirts. Some walked up in box-
ers, briefs, bras and undies, with the
rest of their outfits in their hands.
The Great Underwear Dash de-
scended again upon UF. This semi-
annual tradition returned to give
students a chance to donate clothes
to charity and take a lap around
campus in their skivvies.
Minutes away from midnight,
Dash organizer and UF electrical en-
gineering senior Jorge Gomez stood
in his pink briefs by the trash bins in
the center of Turlington, grinning as
faded t-shirts and ratty shorts rained
down around him.
"This is my favorite part. The
nerves are going, everybody is
throwing their clothes around," he
said.
Gomez is the heir to Beau
Bergeron, a UF alumnus who orga-
nized the first run in the spring of
2005 as a performance art project.
That night, 50 students dashed as
20 spectators watched. Friday night,
more than 300 took part in the dash.On this night, with temperatures
in the 80s, there was a rainbow of
Speedos, briefs, spandex, boy shorts
and the occasional thong.
"FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO,
ONE."With that, the crowd erupted in
a roar of hoots and hollers and took
off in a mad dash for University Av-
enue.
The mass of underwear-clad
youth rumbled through the Plazaof the Americas, led by a figure in
tightie whities wearing a Puerto Ri-
can flag like a cape and a white cow-
boy hat.
This was David De Jesus, who
was experiencing his first dash and
Students run down University Avenue during the Great Underwear Dash held Friday at midnight. The
event started on Turlington Plaza, where students stripped and left their clothes to be donated.not holding back.
"Everybody's kinda flying their
freak flag anyway, so why not?" he
said.
Hooking around Library West,
scores of students lined University
Avenue, some spilling out into the
road to incite horn honks from driv-
ers and cat calls from onlookers.
Once the crowd turned to run
down Fletcher Drive, two police cars
crept along beside the washers, guid-
ing them with flashing lights.
Many runners became joggers
and even walkers when turning
onto Stadium Road to head back to
Turlington, but most picked up the
pace to finish strong.
By 12:20 a.m., most washers, their
bodies glistening with sweat, re-
turned to pack up the clothes.
UF senior Sara Klee, whobrought
her Great Dane, Scout, in red and
white striped boxers, said she really
appreciated the charity aspect.
"That's really the best part. Not
that a bunch of people in their un-
derwear isn't great already," she
said.
As the denizens trickled away,
Gomez surveyed the collection of 22
garbage bags filled with donations.
The clothes either went to Good-
will or the The Salvation Army, he
said.
By 1 a.m., the plaza had cleared,
the glistening bodies were gone and
the clothes were packed away in
Gomez's car. All was quiet.
The air, however, was still thick.

County prepared for swine flu
By MELINDA CARSTENSEN
Alligator Contributing Writer
At this time last year, Alachua County was prepar-
ing for flu season. But this year, the area has been pre-
pared since May -when the county saw its first case
of HINI swine flu.
In Florida, the flu season usually begins in the fall
and ends in April, but UF's Student Health Care Center
has had more than 800 visits for influenza this semes-
ter, according to the SHCC spokesman Guy Nicolette.
During last year's entire flu season, the center only
had 566 visits, he said.
People who are 6 months to 24 years old are more at
risk than those 25 and older, Nicolette said.
"If you were born before 1957, your body has seen
something similar to this in the past, and your body is
less at risk to become infected," said Paul Myers, as-
sistant director of the Alachua County Health Depart-
ment (ACHD).
Myers said about 30,000 people in Alachua County
get the seasonal flu each year. This year, he said he
would not be surprised if 50,000 people in the county
get sick. The ACHD expects about 20 percent of UF
students, about 10,000, will get sick over the course of
the season.
In August, the SHCC stopped testing its patients for
the HINI swine flu. Doctors assumed the patient had
it if he or she had flu-like symptoms."There are other organisms out there that are start-
ing to make their appearance on the stage, but of those
diagnosed with influenza, it's still almost 100 percent
HINI," Myers said.
Sara Klee, a UT wildlife ecology senior, said the
thing she remembers most about getting the swine flu
was the coughing.
"The first night I coughed so much that I bled," she
said.
"I've certainly been sicker than this. It
was not the end of the world."
Sara Klee
UF senior
But Klee also said she thinks all the hype about the
swine flu is exaggerated.
"I've certainly been sicker than this," Klee said. "It
was not the end of the world."
Generally, a young, healthy person who does not
have a preexisting medical condition will recover suc-
cessfully, Nicolette said.
He said preparation is just as important as preven-
tion. He advises students to bar themselves with infor-
mation by going to the UF Web site, calling the SHCC
and, most importantly, by taking their temperatures.
"Temperature is called a vital sign for a reason," Ni-
colette said. "There's so much information to be gained
from just a simple temperature."Research may help
Parkinson's patients
By ASHLYN POWELL
Alligator Contributing Writer
UF researchers have made
a breakthrough in gene thera-
py, which they hope will help
reduce Parkinson's disease
symptoms.
The new treatment will al-
low the brain to create dop-
amine, a neurotransmitter that
is significantly lacking in the
brains of Parkinson's patients.
Dopamine helps the brain
control the body's movements
and controls information flow
into the brain, including mem-
ory, attention and problem-
solving tasks.
"We have a therapeutic
gene, and we want to controlhow much of it is made. We
want to turn it off and on as we
see fit," said Fredric Manfreds-
son, a postdoctoral associate in
the UF Department of Neuro-
science.
The therapeutic gene pro-
tects dopamine-producing
U F cells, whichUeeF h then lessen Par-Research kinson's symp-
toms.
"The reason we are excited
about this factor is it gives an
added safety feature," Man-
fredsson said. "A lot of animal
trials have shown it should al-
low a lot of the cells not to de-
generate."
The team is obtaining funds
to begin testing the therapy on
early-stage patients, he said.

STUDENT GOVERNMENT
SG minority parties look to the future after election
By BRANDON BRESLOW
Alligator Contributing Writer
With new senators installed
and the Unite Party maintaining
the majority of the Student Sen-
ate, leaders of both minority par-
ties have said their work for the
semester is just beginning.
Progress Party President Dave
Schneider said his party will fight
for its platform while it evaluates
the results of the fall election.
"We're going to continue
meeting with student groups, get-
ting them to come into the Senate
to express their concerns, and
struggle alongside them to make
sure that our legislative agenda
is completely in touch with the
students' will," said Schneider, afounding member of the Progress
Party.
Orange and Blue Party Sen.
Jonathan Ossip said his party will
be persistent in pushing impor-
tant issues in the Senate, regard-
less of it holding only two seats.
"The Orange and Blue Party
will continue to be the most ac-
tive party in the Senate, bringing
key legislation to reform Student
Government and fighting for stu-
dent rights," said Ossip, who was
re-elected to represent the Mur-
phree Area.
The Orange and Blue Party
is fighting for issues regarding
budget reforms and open access
to SG records, Ossip said.
This fall, the Orange and Blue
Party walked away with the Mur-
phree Area and Keys ResidentialComplex seats.
The Progress Party earned one
seat, representing family hous-
ing, in the Student Senate but
failed to maintain the seat repre-
senting Rawlings Hall.
Both minority parties agree
that their losses
were casualties
of low voter
turnout.
"Low turn-
out means that
a small elite gets
to determine the
Ossip entire course of
action without
input from the majority," Sch-
neider said. "There's power in
the eight out of 10 students who
don't consider Student Govern-
ment worth their time, and, byreaching out to them through our
legislative agenda, we want to
channel that."
SG Supervisor of Elections Ari-
ana Alfonso announced after the
election that 8,483 students voted
this fall, about 2,000 students less
than last fall's election.
Ossip said the three-party
election contributed to the low
turnout.
"Many people were confused
about the difference between
Orange and Blue and Progress,
which is limited, and instead
chose not to vote at all," he said.
Since the Progress Party's
conception in early spring, one
of the issues it has attempted to
address, and will continue to ad-
dress through grassroots cam-
paigns, has been student partici-pation.
"A system cannot be demo-
cratic if the student masses don't
participate in the process," Sch-
neider said.
The Progress Party will use
this recent decline in turnout as
another reason to campaign for
online voting, said Nick Mildeb-
rath, the party's campaign man-
ager.
Both parties are already plan-
ning for next spring's election,
when seats representing UF's
undergraduate and graduate col-
leges will be up for grabs.
"I promised our candidates
the night of the election that we
would be the ones cheering on
the night of the spring election,"
Schneider said. "I see every rea-
son for this to happen."
UF to raffle free Snuggies throughout football season
0 THE SNUGGLES FEATURE THE
GATORS LOGO.
By MELINDA CARSTENSEN
Alligator Contributing Writer
The blanket with sleeves, the Snuggie,
could be yours for free.
Starting Saturday, the UF Bookstore will
give away free Florida Gators Snuggies be-
fore each remaining Gators football game."My friends don't want to get me [a Snug-
giel because they think I sleep too much al-
ready," said Keely McKissack, a UF public
relations junior.
To be eligible to win a Snuggie this week,
one must become a fan of the UF Bookstore
on Facebook and RSVP to the UF Bookstore
Gators Snuggie Give Away event by noon
Friday.
As of Sunday night, more than 4,800 peo-
ple were signed up on the Facebook event.
According to the store's Facebook page,10 winners will be selected randomly before
the UF-Arkansas game.
"All you have to do is join two things on
Facebook, so I was like, 'why
On not?' McKissack said. "Any-
Campus thing Gators is good in my
book."
Winners will be notified on Facebook in a
message or on the event wall.
Lynne Vaughan, director of UF book-
stores, said they decided to have this give-
away because the Gators Snuggie is sellingphenomenally online and in the bookstore.
"It amazes me how many people are buy-
ing them," she said. "We're one of the lead-
ing sellers [of Snuggie blankets] among col-
lege bookstores."
Originally, the Snuggie was available in
burgundy, royal blue and green. But now
the blanket is offered in more than 50 college
team logos.
The Gators Snuggie is $24.95 at the UF
Bookstore and $19.95 on collegiatesnuggies.

Help Wanted
Alligator seeks editor for
opinions section
W e are desperate for your opinion.
Our board currently consists of three students
who work about 50 hours (each) in a five-day
week to help produce the largest student-run newspaper
in the country.
That's 50 hours that we spend within the walls of the
Alligator office, time that doesn't include schoolwork or
the little sleep we get.
In a perfect world, the opinions editor develops ideas
for editorials and presents them to the board by 7 p.m.
But because we don't have one, the remaining board
members have been coming up with ideas and writing the
editorials instead of fulfilling our normal job responsibili-
ties.
Our section editors have had to take the responsibility
of editing pages while we're busy writing a half-assed edi-
torial. We can't do our jobs well when we have too many
hats and not enough heads.
We don't have another 10 hours to spend writing edito-
rials, editing letters to the editor, cutting columns or craft-
ing cartoon ideas.
If you read the Alligator's editorials regularly, you
know what we're looking for.
To apply, e-mail a resume and sample editorials to ap-
ply@alligator.org.
We want someone who can write on behalf of the board
-not a column -and who can justify his or her opinions
with facts.
Because, the fact is, we're running out of things to say.
And Justice For All
The day before tens ofthousands of gay rights
supporters marched
on Washington, D.C., Presi-
dent Barack Obama spoke
at the annual Human Rights
Campaign black-tie dinner,
vowing to end "Don't Ask,
Don't Tell."
However, Obama's prom-
ise to eliminate the policy,
which was enacted 15 years
ago and prevents gay and
lesbian people from openly
serving in the military, was
no different from the promis-
es he made while campaign-
ing for the presidency.
While we support repeal-
ing "Don't Ask, Don't Tell,"
we question why Obama
continues to pledge to repeal
the policy when he clearly
has a slew of other priorities.
Obama is more likely to
tackle health care reform,
the economy and the warsin Iraq and Afghanistan be-
fore he pushes for legisla-
tion to end discrimination in
the military. Though "Don't
Ask, Don't Tell" should be
abolished, it doesn't affect
American households in the
way that health care reform
would.
If Obama is as serious
as he sounded on Saturday
night, then he should set a
timeline for reversing the
policy.
It's unfair for Obama to
get people's hopes up when
it isn't feasible for him to ful-
fill his promises as quickly as
many would like him to.
While "Don't Ask, Don't
Tell" may not affect as many
people, abolishing the policy
means a lot to those whom
it directly impacts. Its repeal
proves that the United States
is a nation striving toward
equal rights for all.

Obama has chance to earn peace prize
red Armisen offered the most precise answer thisSaturday as to why President Obama was awarded
the Nobel Peace Prize in a surprise Oslo announce-
ment on Friday: "Because I'm not George Bush."
Armisen's Obama then accepted another reward, a
Powerball lottery check worth $70 million. All the sweeter,
after all, because it was his character's first time playing
the lottery.
It's clear that the humorists at SNL have tapped into
the hilarity of the president's good fortune and his seem-
ingly affable air about it.
Even still, the announcement from Oslo was met more
with gasps of shock than laughter of irony. Rush Lim-
baugh and his anonymous "dittohead bootlickers" nearly
fell into cardiac arrest spurred from their anger. Bill Kristol
declared he should have received an award for his efforts
at peace, and across the nation people of all political af-
filiations scratched their head in surprise, turning to each
other to ask, "for what?"
By now, my opinion of President Obama is fairly evi-
dent to regular readers of this column: He could screw up
bigger than 43 ever dreamed of, and I still wouldn't harbor
a single doubt about not voting for McPalin and Co.
Just the same, after the initial euphoria of knowing
the leader of the United States was at least respected and
not disdained by some in the international community, I
found myself reaching for the phone.
"Why did this happen?" I asked a more politically con-
servative friend. The reply, unfortunately, is not fit for
print, and there was more hissing than a coiled up ball
python on the other end of the line.
"It's a shame the award didn't go to someone who put
their life on the line and had accomplished an actual con-
crete peace, rather than someone who has just spoken of
this peace," said another conservative friend, Will Motch,an Applied Physiology and Kinesi-
ology sophomore at UF.
The latter, levelheaded response
is the opinion I fall into. President
Obama may have felt humbled by
the prize and the company of people
Matthew Christ the award places him in, but it's not
letters@alligator org an incredibly peaceful list. Henry
Kissinger is on the list. Yasser Arafat
won the prize in 1994. In 1912, Elihu
Root, a former secretary of state and war who pillaged the
Philippines, is also a Nobel Peace Prize recipient.
As much as I like Obama, and as much as I want him to
succeed -a stark contrast to some of our more "patriotic"
and sanctimonious conservative pundits and congress-
men -the Nobel Prize committee shorted themselves
and devalued the award by naming Obama the 2009 win-
ner. Or did they?
The office President Obama holds has the ability to ef-
fect more change around the world in one day than many
people can accomplish in a lifetime.
He has made great promises to seek peace, to renew
dialogue with nations that we have previously ignored,
and has sought a more multilateral, rather than unilateral
approach to foreign policy.
Over the next three years, Obama has the opportunity
to prove the Nobel committee right by using our military
might to make right, by leading any international discus-
sion away from impetuousness, but towards prudence,
and by leading the way in reducing the world's depen-
dence on oil, lessening the grip petro-dictators hold on
their people and world stability.
Now that's the peace I could believe in.

Guest column
Obama should win Heisman
for direction, determination
In the wake of President Barack Obama
surprising the planet by winning the
Nobel Peace Prize on Friday, I would
like to throw his name into the conversa-
tion for another prestigious award: the
Heisman.
The Heisman Memorial Trophy Award
is awarded annually to the most outstand-
ing player in college football.
Here's a quick look at the numbers
of the leading candidates according to
ESPN: Tim Tebow (777 yards passing, 309
yards rushing, 12 total touchdowns, 2 in-
terceptions), Colt McCoy (1410, 58, 11, 6),
Jimmy Clausen (1544, -45, 12, 2).
You would think that Obama (0, 0, 0,
0) has a great bit of ground to make up in
this venture.
With a little research, one can confirm
that he has four years of eligibility re-
maining, which is plenty of time to justify
the award.
It is also important to note that despite
his lack of positive yardage, he is the only
candidate who has not thrown an inter-
ception this year.
Protecting the football is imperative
to success in college football, and Obama
has done an outstanding job of doing just
that.Kyle Krutek Obamahasagreat
Speaking Out deal of momentum
in his direction com-
ing off winning the Nobel Peace Prize be-
fore the end of his first year in office.
If he can snatch that award from the
clutches of candidates that many consid-
ered more deserving, it should come as
no surprise to anyone if he brings home
the stiff-arming statue.
I think the Heisman voters would be
in good form to end the debate early and
present him with the trophy before the
winner is announced on December 12 of
this year.
If nothing else, it would show a vote of
confidence in his abilities and the direc-
tion he is taking his program.
Although he hasn't amassed any
stats to speak of, the season is young
and if Obama continues on his path, he
will surely dominate the college football
world.
With Dez Bryant recently ruled ineli-
gible, Tebow no longer putting up video
game-caliber numbers and the Big 12
looking weaker than last year, you have
to like his chances.
Kyle Krutek is a senior in the College of
Engineering.Letter to the Editor
Florida lacks pre-game sportsmanship
I congratulate UF on defeating Louisiana
State University Saturday night in Tiger Sta-
dium. I was in the stadium.
However, hypocrisy and classlessness ap-
pear to abound in the UF football program.
Indeed, Urban Meyer and the coaching staff
should instill values about pre-game sports-
manship. It's ironic that the SEC has com-
mercials during every telecast attempting to
showcase sportsmanship, but these are ap-
parently not internalized by UT players. Be-
fore Saturday's game, UT players went to the
4 f
& -E W Iyp50-yard line to "stomp" on the Eye of the Ti-
ger image. LSU players came out to meet the
Florida intruders, and the two sides had to be
separated by officials and coaches.
Tebow wears eye patches with scriptures.
Hence, the Philippians 4:13 verse is hypocriti-
cal as it is taken out of context from the rest of
the passage which was written in prison.
Furthermore, the Fellowship of Christian
Athletes has players on both sides of the ball.
What if Tebow is tackled by a player who
wears Isaiah 40:29? Go and read it yourself.
Such hypocrisy.

Goth group hosts bat-themed dance party for charity
By MEG WAGNER
Alligator Contributing Writer
At downtown club The Attic Fri-
day night, it seemed like Halloween
came a little early.
About 90 people passed under
plastic bats as they entered the
club for Goth organization Heart
of Darkness's "Release the Bats"
event, a dance party to benefit the
Florida Bat Conservancy.
Heart of Darkness was estab-
lished in 2005 when Barry Mitchell,
who is now the organization's pres-
ident, noticed that the Goth scene
was dying in Gainesville.
"A club would close, and it
would take months before another
dance night would start up. In the
time in between, the people would
lose touch with each other," Mitch-
ell said.
They formed the group as a way
to make the scene more commu-
nity-oriented, and began organiz-
ing social events, like their weekly
Goth Night.
Mitchell wanted to incorporate
community service into Heart of
Darkness as a means to broaden
the social group's impact, but wasKatie Dean, 20, looks over items up for auction at Release the Bats, a charity event held Friday at the
Attic, 233 W. University Ave. The event raised money for the Florida Bat Conservancy.

a charity. He wanted to find an or- younger members [of the Goth The Florida Bat Conservancy,
ganization that complemented the scene] are called Baby Bats. There which rescues orphaned and in-
Goth image. has just always been a bat theme jured bats and rehabilitates them,
"Goth started in London in a that goes with [Goth]," Mitchell seemed like a perfect match."Bats don't get a lot of fund rais-
ing," said Florida Bat Conservancy
executive director Cyndi Marks.
On the dance floor, people
swayed to the thumping music of
the DJ, green, blue and red strobe
lights pulsating over them. Out in
the foyer of the club, a silent auc-
tion featured books on bats and
bat themed jewelry, hand made in
Nepal.
Marks, who traded in her nor-
mal attire of jeans and a Florida Bat
Conservancypolo for fishnet sleeves
and violet clip-in hair streaks, gave
club goers information about Flor-
ida bats. Her white display board
glowed a brilliant shade of laven-
der in the club's black light.
"This is the only club in town I
come to," said Acacia Ramey, an
attendee donning a crushed-velvet
cape and black fingerless gloves.
"It's the only place I can dress like
this and not be judged."
Among the Goths in attendance
are law students, small business
owners, war veterans and mechani-
cal engineers.
"People are still prejudiced
about Goths. This might soften our
image," Ramey said.
SG holds grand opening for Hub's extended hours
0 STARBUCKS, GATOR DINING TO
HAVE GIVEAWAYS.
By CAROLYN TILLO
Alligator Writer
The Hub's extended hours may have gone
into effect last week, but the study party con-
tinues tonight with giveaways from Starbucksand Gator Dining.
The Hub's All Night Study Hours Grand
Opening will take place at 10 p.m.
Starbucks will offer buy-one-get-one
Pumpkin Spice Lattes and White Chocolate
Mocha products, while Gator Dining will pass
out dining coupons and T-shirts, said Student
Body President Jordan Johnson.
The Hub formerly closed at 8 p.m. on
weekdays and 6 p.m. on weekends, but John-son said in an e-mail that Student Govern-
ment allocated $30,000 to extend its hours
from 8 a.m. to 3 a.m. until January 2010.
"My hope is to show stu-
On dents the power their voice hasCampus on campus," Johnson wrote.
"Having an all-night study cen-
ter has been Student Government's opportu-
nity to respond to the needs of our Student
Body."Johnson said the move to extend the Hub's
hours also is a response to the higher-educa-
tion trend of having a late-night study center.
UF was one of the few universities in Flori-
da without a late-night study center, he said.
President Machen has also suggested us-
ing $12 million in stimulus funds to modify
an existing campus building and create a per-
manent 24-hour study center, according to
Alligator archives.
Committee got 205 nominations
OBAMA, from page 1
agree with Taliban and Iran about, and that
is he doesn't deserve the award," Limbaugh
said on the show.
Local Republicans also criticized the
award.
"I don't have much to say other than it's
ridiculous," said Bryan Griffin, chairman of
UF College Republicans. "The peace prize is
entirely subjective and meaningless."
Republican Party of Alachua County
Chairman Stafford Jones wasn't as critical of
the Nobel Peace Prize but believed the pres-
ident didn't deserve the award. Though af-
ter hearing the news he said, "What kind of
goofiness is this?"
Jones said he believed the president
could do wonderful things to bring peace in
his term, but he hasn't done them yet.
"In Europe, there is an Obama euphoria
that isn't grounded in anything," he said.
Jones was also suspicious that the presi-
dent was nominated by Feb. 1 -less than
two weeks into his term.
But Ben Cavataro, president of Florida
College Democrats and vice president of the
organization's UF chapter, said the award is
an affirmation of American leadership.
While Cavataro was astonished Obama
won the award, Republicans' denounce-
ment of it didn't surprise him. He thought it
was similar to some conservatives recentlyrooting against the president's efforts to win
Chicago the Olympic bid for 2016.
"Just like the Olympics, this should unite
us," Cavataro said.
Jon Reiskind, chairman of the Alachua
County Democratic Party, said he believed
the award recognizes the relief of the world
after eight years of the Bush administration.
"I think that Americans should feel bet-
ter about their place in the world, and this
award is a reflection of that," Reiskind said.
In the last decade,
Democrats Al Gore and
Jimmy Carter have won
the prize.
The last conserva-
tive American to win
the award was Henry
Kissinger in 1973 for his
Obama role in ending the Viet-
nam War.
Only two other American presidents
have won the award while in office -Theo-
dore Roosevelt won in 1906 for his media-
tion of the Russo-Japanese war, and Wood-
row Wilson won in 1919 for founding the
League of Nations.
"I can't read the mind of the Norwegian
committee, but I think this is meant to en-
courage the president to continue the course
he set out on," Reiskind said.
This year's committee received more
nominations than ever in the past -205.Water damages 2nd, 3rd floors
FLOOD, from page 1
bert Area Office, said the alarm system
went off, saying something was wrong
with the pipes that belong to the emer-
gency water flow.
He said he believes that young men
who were playing football in the cor-
ridor may have hit a sprinkler with the
ball causing the pipe to break.
"From what I heard, the second and
third floors of the building got most of
the water because of the elevator shaft
located in the middle of building," Perry
said. "The stairwell that connects both
Riker and North halls also got flooded."
Students were directed to wait in the
Weaver Hall basement and the Tolbert
1906 Club, which are common areas
where students can study.
All residential assistants were con-
tacted to come in to help monitor the
building so no one would get in, Perry
said. Emergency cleanup crew also re-
sponded to the situation.
No one was allowed in until 7 or 8
p.m., Perry said. Students could only get
valuables and clothing, but anyone that
had water on his or her floor of the dormwas not allowed to stay the night.
Many students were encouraged to
spend the night elsewhere.
Perry said most students were al-
lowed to get in their dorm by midnight.
Assessing the cost and damages will
be hard due to the loss of personal items
like clothes and electronics, Perry said.
Anyone who wants to make a claim
can do so through UF's Department of
Housing and Residence Education by
Beaty Towers, Perry said.
Perry said it has been a challenge
dealing with students who were out of
town during the incident.
Patrick Anderson, a UF sophomore
who lives on the third floor, said he lost
a calculator and textbooks, but the big-
gest hassle has been the cleanup.
According to a statement released by
the Riker Hall staff, "building services
and the staff opened every door and
used a truck mounted shop vacuum to
dry the floors, and all wet items were
placed in plastic bags."
The incident is still under investiga-
tion, but Perry said if no one steps up
and takes responsibility, it's likely that
all third floor residents will be charged.

Tebow gets start, plays conservatively
By KYLE MAISTRI
Alligator Staff Writer
kmalstr @a I|gatororg
BATON ROUGE, La. -Just under six minutes into
Saturday night's showdown between No. 1 Florida and
No. 4 LSU, The Gator Nation held its collective breath.
On first and 10 from the UF 49-yard line, senior quar-
terback Tim Tebow dropped back to pass, stood tall in
the pocket and delivered a pass to tight end Aaron Her-
nandez with cornerback Patrick Peterson bearing down
on him.
Peterson put a clean hit on Tebow and sent the Heis-
man Trophy winner to his back for the first time since
Kentucky's Taylor Wyndham knocked Tebow out of the
game with a concussion two weeks ago in Lexington.
The play went for an 8-yard gain, and Tebow bounced
up to his feet right away.
"First drive, hit by Peterson, actually I liked it,"
Tebow said. "First time I got hit, everything felt good,
so I was like all right, ready to go."
UF coach Urban Meyer admitted to using a "some-
what conservative" game plan to keep his quarterback
from taking too many hits. Meyer felt as long as the de-
fense was holding LSU, he didn't need to expose Tebow
too much.
Those factors dictated the way the game was played
-a 13-3 defensive struggle between the winners of the
last three BCS national championships.
"That was two sledgehammers going at each other,"
Meyer said. "Obviously, LSU is as talented a team as
there is in the country."
Tebow threw for 134 yards on 11-of-16 passing and
added 38 yards on the ground on 17 rushing attempts.
The number of rushing attempts logged by Tebow
came as a bit of a surprise considering he only ran the
ball five times in the first half.
An unofficial count had him keeping the ball just
three times out of 15 option and read-option plays in the
first 30 minutes.

Gators suffer first SEC sweep under Wise
By ANTHONY CHIANG
Alligator Writer
achiang@alligator org
On Sunday, the Gators dropped the
first set of a conference road match for the
second time in five days.
Florida recovered to win the next three
sets to defeat South Carolina on Wednes-
day. The team wasn't as fortunate the sec-
ond time around.
After squandering a close opening
set in Baton Rouge, La., No. 6 UF (12-3,
6-2 Southeastern Conference) could not
bounce back and was swept by LSU 3-0
(28-26, 25-20, 25-22). Before the loss, theGators had never been swept in a regu-
lar-season conference match under coach
Mary Wise.

Gators was evident, as
they could not regain

their poor play put them

sophomores, but LSU

"The difference in the match was that
their older players played great and our
younger players played very young to-night," Wise said.
From the first set to the final point, UF
had no answer for one of those LSU se-
niors -middle blocker Brittnee Cooper.
She dominated the Gators' front line and
finished the match with 18 kills and zero
errors to go along with a superb .692 hit-
ting percentage to lead the Tigers (13-4,
7-1 SEC).
On the other side of the net, sopho-
more middle blocker Cassandra Anderson
could not match Cooper's production. She
finished with one kill and just three block
assists.

BATON ROUGE, La.
or the second time in three
years, I hopped in my Civic
and made the eight-hour trip to
Louisiana for the Florida-LSU game.
Much like 2007, we drove west
in two cars, made a stop in New Or-
leans and stayed in a hotel off of 1-10,

The game was highly anticipated

ranked No. 1 this time around.

night.
On my previous trip, I came as
a fan hoping to watch UF knock off
the No. 1 team in the nation behind
a mostly unproven sophomore quar-
terback named Tim Tebow.
No one knew how he would re-
act to the raucous crowd of Tiger Sta-
dium. Ironically, not much changed
this time around, though for a very
different reason.
Saturday, I parked my car in a de-
cal-only lot -as opposed to finding
a hopefully tow-free spot somewhere
on Nicholson Drive and walking 20
minutes -and made my way to the
press box to cover the biggest game
of my young journalism career.
I fully expected the Gators to win
by a healthy margin, with or with-
out a healthy Tebow, despite the
Tigers' No. 4 ranking and 32-game
win streak in Saturday night home
games.
When the whistle blew, the scene
on the field looked completely differ-

UF favors rushing attack
in conservative gameplan
FOOTBALL, from page 1
"Coach Strong, if he finds any-
thing to motivate the team or make
them feel like people are against
us, he's going to let us know," Ha-
den said. "Spikes was mad. Spikes
thought coach Strong called Herb-
streit and told him to say that."
The nation's best defense (allow-
ing 202.6 yards per game) held LSU
to 66 yards rushing on 30 carries.
The Gators have still only al-
lowed two touchdowns on the sea-
son after holding the Tigers (5-1, 3-1
SEC) to only a field goal when LSU
was threatening to take the lead in
the second quarter.
Florida stuffed running back
Charles Scott on third and goal from
the 2, and LSU coach Les Miles took
the safe route and sent out his kicker
to even the score from 18 yards out.
Those 3 points would mark the
peak of the Tigers' offensive pro-
duction.
On their next possession, Haden
picked off Jordan Jefferson, sending
the teams to halftime with Florida
leading 10-3, and extending UF's
streak of games with an interception
to 17, longest in the nation.
The Gators, who also lead the
nation in points allowed per game
(6.4), seemed to step it up even an-
other notch for the second half.
In four second-half drives, LSU
combined for 29 yards and never got
farther than its own 36-yard line.
"In the first half, we didn't reallyplay that well as a unit, but coach
Strong came in and got at us," safety
Will Hill said. "We came out and we
all gelled together and played great
defense."We were trying to make a state-
ment that the Gators defense is here
to play, and we're going to show
you why we're the No.1 team in the
country.",
Thanks to its defense, UF's of-
fense didn't have to be flashy Sat-
urday night. That's probably a
good thing, because the Gators
didn't seem to bring along their
high-octane spread offense from
Gainesville.
Florida ended LSU's 32-game
Saturday night home winning
streak by grinding it out. The Gators
ran for 193 yards on 48 carries (com-
pared to 16 pass attempts) and dom-
inated the time-of-possession battle
36:30 to 23:30.
It's a theme that may continue,
with UF ranked second in the coun-
try in rushing offense and 78th in
passing offense.
Tebow's 24-yard pass to Riley
Cooper in the second quarter was
the only time either team would
reach the end zone.
"We've had some high-scoring
teams, like the team two years ago,
but you don't win games that way,"
coach Urban Meyer said. "All the
great teams I've been associated
with have had a fantastic defense."
For many of Florida's players,
Saturday night was a chance for
vindication after UF came to Baton

UF bounces back from poor play with weekend sweep
* FLORIDA DEFEATED ALABAMA
2-0 AND AUBURN 4-0.
By TYLER JETT
Alligator Writer
tjett@alligator org
The UF soccer team needed to regain re-
spect.That was the sentiment of the players
and coaches last week after appearing vul-
nerable on a trip to Mississippi, and they
made a statement this weekend.
No. 14 Florida (10-4-1, 4-1-1 Southeast-
ern Conference) defeated Auburn (5-6-3,
2-4-0 SEC) on Sunday 4-0, proving it is still
a premier team in the conference.
UF also won 2-0 against Alabama on Fri-
day.
"If we wanted to change the way peo-
ple were thinking about us this year in the
SEC, then we really needed to come out
and prove to people that we are a force to
be reckoned with," UF goalkeeper Katie
Fraine said.
UF coach Becky Burleigh said last week
the Gators defense needed to improve, and
the back line played with more urgency this
weekend.
In the two wins, UF outshot its oppo-
nents 37-8, and Fraine needed a total of two
saves to record two shutouts.
"After last weekend, I'm happy to have
a weekend off and watch my team play
phenomenally," Fraine said.
Whenever Tigers forwards got inside
the Gators' defensive third, the UF back
line swarmed to the ball. Auburn only had
one good opportunity in the first half, and it
actually translated to a Florida goal.
In the 20th minute, Auburn earned a cor-
ner kick that was cleared out by the Gators.
Midfielder Jessica Eicken sent a long pass to
the top of the Tigers' penalty box, connect-ing with senior Angela Napolitano, who
outran two Auburn defenders and shot the
ball across the box, putting it in the left side
of the net to give Florida a 1-0 lead.
The Gators' failed to maintain momen-
tum after Napolitano's goal as their attack
stalled and they were unable to put the Ti-
gers away.
Following UF's win Friday, Burleigh
said the team was out of sync. Players send-
ing crosses into the box were often inaccu-
rate, and Florida forwards and midfielders
mistimed the ball in the rare occasions a
goal could have been scored off a cross.
"It was a carbon copy of Friday's game
for us early," Burleigh said.
Auburn's defense was also problematic
for Florida, as it put as many as seven play-
ers in the box to defend the Gators' attack.
But UF finally sealed the game with an
Erika Tymrak goal in the 77th minute.
The freshman corralled a blocked shot
at the top of the penalty box, sidestepped
a defender and ripped a shot from 15 yards
out.
With a 2-0 deficit, Auburn's defense lost
all confidence.
Six minutes after her goal, Tymrak re-
covered the ball in her own defensive third
and carried it unmarked to the other side of
the field before taking a hard foul just out-
side the penalty box.
The Gators were awarded a free kick,
and senior Lauren Hyde beat goalkeeper
Amy Howard to the left from 23 yards out.
Hyde has two goals on the year, both com-
ing off free kicks.
Florida capped the game with a goal
from midfielder McKenzie Barney, whose
shot hit the back of the net as the clock ran
out.
"It was a pretty sweet goal because she
took it down really well," Burleigh said.
"When you can hear (the fans) counting
down, that probably adds to the stress."49t% '7

TEBOW, from page 13
On instances of third and 3, third and 1
and fourth and 2, Meyer elected to put the
ball in the hands of three different players,
none of whom were wearing No. 15.
"I tried to play smart," Tebow said.
"I said I'm not going to go out there and
play tentative and scared. That's just not
me. I'm going to play hard and be smart
and get out of bounds, get down, not try
to fight. I think I avoided some of the hits I
probably would take like that, but I wasn't
scared or tentative at all."Running backs Jeff Demps and Emman-
uel Moody carried the ball in the first two
situations with Moody converting on third
and 1 and Demps gaining only a yard on
third and 3.
Meyer elected to go for it on the subse-
quent fourth and 2, but the Gators ran a
reverse with wide receiver Brandon James
rather than pounding the ball up the mid-
dle with Tebow. LSU sniffed out the play,
and UF turned the ball over on downs.

Meyer said he sat down with Tebow's
father, Bob Tebow, and the two had a
90-minute discussion about the possibility
of playing Tim.
"He said, 'My son is going to be fine.
Once they get clearance, I'll support any-
thing you do,"' Meyer said. "I know he's

on LSU's front line. The Tigers
won the kills battle by 12 after
hitting 56 on the night.
This was the first time in 21
regular-season matches that the
Gators did not
win when they
outblocked an
opponent.Volleyball Now, UF
finds itself in an
uphill climb if it wants to win
a 19th consecutive conference
title. Florida is now two matches
behind SEC leader Kentucky.
"Our team has never been
out of the race in October, so
how we respond will be real key
here," Wise said.KYLE, from page 13
90-degree angle but refused to break in front of a
record home crowd.
The Gators defense was even better.
Brandon Spikes played at the highest level I
have ever seen him play over the last four years.
The previously unassuming pass rush harassed
LSU quarterback Jordan Jefferson all night. And the
secondary blanketed the opposing receivers for the
duration.
Last time I found myself looking into the eye of
the Tiger, both offenses traded blows on the way
to a 28-24 LSU victory. Quarterback Matt Flynn
and running back Jacob Hester drove the Tigers
down the field at the end of the fourth quarter,
overwhelming an inexperienced Gators defense
that was unable to come up with a stop in multiple
short-yardage situations.Both times, I never really questioned what the
outcome would be, no matter how close the score.
I got the feeling that a battle-tested LSU team
would eventually impose its will on UF just as the
Gators imposed their will on the Tigers in 2009.
Neither win was pretty, but both were huge
confidence builders for a couple of talented veteran
teams in the early part of the season.
After UF's loss, I walked out of the stadium and
back to the car with my Orange-and-Blue friends,
trying to avoid any gloating LSU fans in my path.
This time, I sent my final story for publication
and walked down to the empty, perfectly lit field
with my sportswriter friends to take some pic-
tures.
The differences between the two trips were nu-
merous, but both times I left Baton Rouge believing
I had just watched the eventual national champions
grind out a tough win against a young team that
was in way over its head.
