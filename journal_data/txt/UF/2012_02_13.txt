  Guests clustered around tangy aromas of 
South African wines and sweet smells of ton-gol tuna salad as the Hippodrome State The-atre ﬁ  lled for its cinema’s birthday celebra-tion.
  The theater hosted the 30th anniversary of 
the Hippodrome Cinema on Saturday night with an evening of food, wine and music.
  Hippodrome State Theatre, a theater in 
downtown Gainesville, is home to the cinema, which opened in 1982 to showcase indepen-dent and commercial ﬁ  lms.  “This event is a landmark event, not only 
for the Hippodrome, but also for Gainesville,” said Jessica Hurov, a spokeswoman for the Hippodrome. “Thirty years of independent cinema is truly remarkable.”
  The Hippodrome Cinema ordered 150 
wine glasses for the guests, and 222 tickets were sold.
  The tickets were $25 in advance and $35 
at the door. The proceeds will help fund im-provements to the cinema’s sound system. Hippodrome celebrates 30th
ADMISSIONS

  Five minutes before UF released its freshman 
admission decisions on its website Friday, Yu-
lie Choi did what thousands of other hopeful high school seniors did: said a quick prayer and checked Facebook.
  Some of her friends had already posted sta-
tuses with their decisions, so Choi started to re-fresh the admissions page. And kept refreshing.
  Around 5:10 p.m., the site ﬁ  nally loaded. The 
page read, “Congratulations!”
  She was in.  Choi, a 17-year-old from Tampa, was one of 
a record-high 29,300 applicants, according to in-formation provided by UF spokesman Steve Or-lando. He said the number of applications has been on the rise during the last few years.
  About 11,700 students were accepted for UF’s 
Summer B and Fall 2012 semesters, he said.
  Innovation Academy, a new 
program in which students enroll during the summer and spring semesters and have fall 
semesters free, admitted 1,366 students, he said. 
Applicants were able to in-
dicate their interest in the pro-gram, which offers 22 majors and focuses on innovation and 
leadership. UF admits about 11,700 freshmen

  Protesters gathered outside Florida Sen. Steve Oelrich’s 
ofﬁ  ce Friday evening to confront the senator for voting 
against a bill that would have allowed some children of undocumented immigrants to pay in-state tuition.
  The Senate Higher Education Committee turned down 
the measure on Jan. 31. 
Oelrich is the chair of that committee.  The bill, SB 1018, would have allowed students who attended Florida high schools for at least two consecu-tive years to pay in-state tuition if they enrolled within 12 months of their high school graduation. 
This would have included children born in the U.S. to 
undocumented immigrants.
  Victor Yengle, a 23-year-old economics junior, said he 
organized the vigil as an attempt to change the senator’s mind after Oelrich killed the bill.
  “They’ve managed to turn this into us versus them,” 
he said. “Illegals versus people.”
  Oelrich greeted the 19 protesters and defended his po-sition. 
He said it is a tradition in Florida for the parents’ ori-
gin to determine residency.
  He gave an example of his son, who paid out-of-state 
tuition in Colorado because his parents lived in Florida.
  “I’ve yet to see why this is a bad system,” Oelrich 
said.
  The comment rustled the group, prompting some pas-
sionate counterarguments before Oelrich rushed to an-other meeting.
  One remark came from Gainesville City Commissioner 
Randy Wells, who addressed the senator directly.
  “The system is creating two citizenship classes,” he 
said. “Don’t visit the sins of the father on the son.”  Protesters confront senator about vote against controversial bill

Israeli journalist to discuss coverage of Israeli-Palestinian conflict
An award-winning Israeli jour -
nalist and author will share her ex-periences covering the Israeli-Pal-estinian conflict at 6 p.m. Monday at UF’s Pugh Hall.
Amira Hass, known for her 
work as a reporter for the Israeli daily newspaper Haaretz while liv-ing in the Gaza Strip, will present her speech “Israel and Palestine: Fear of the Future” in the Bob Gra-ham Center for Public Service. She will discuss the Israeli presence in the West Bank and its political ef-fect on the local population.  
Shelby Taylor, digital and com-
munications director for the center, said she hopes Hass’s speech will help inform the public of the issues facing the Middle East, including the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
“We thought it would be in-
teresting to bring someone of that caliber who creates that much ex-citement to the center,” she said. “I’m hoping that she can shed some light on those issues for our students.”
The event is co-sponsored by 
the Bob Graham Center, the UF International Center and The Isser and Rae Price Library of Judaica Endowment Fund. It will be free and open to the public, Taylor said.
Jordan Indermuehle, a 20-year-
old political science sophomore, said attending Hass’s speech would provide him with another perspective of the conflict from someone who experienced it first-hand.
“Hass’s speech would be inter -
esting because she’s an Israeli liv-ing behind enemy lines,” he said. “It’s important to get information from a wide variety of sources in order to better understand a con-flict of this magnitude.”

Feb. 13, 1974: Members of the Hare Krishna re-
ligious group are ordered by the University Police 
Department to remove their tents from the Plaza of the Americas. Tents and other temporary housing facilities are banned unless receiving prior permis-sion from the Physical Plant Division Dig Permit Office. A week before, members from the group were arrested after three Tolbert Hall residents complained that the group was soliciting funds and selling incense.
Feb. 14, 1983: Baby Gator nursery board mem-

President Barack Obama announced Thursday that Flori-
da schools don’t have to follow the federal regulations of the 
No Child Left Behind Act. Some Alachua County educators said the measure will allow schools to focus on evaluation methods other than the FCAT when determining whether a school is successful.
The President approved a petition that allowed 10 states, 
including Florida, to form their own education plans free from the No Child Left Behind Act, provided the states cre-ate an educational plan to help students prepare for college and careers.
States exempt from the act don’t have to get all of their 
students on grade level for reading and math on the FCAT by 2014, which was part of the act’s requirements.
“I am glad to see they are going to let Florida operate 
under Florida rules,” said Dan Boyd Jr., superintendent of schools for Alachua County.
Boyd said the government had set unreasonable expecta-
tions for students. Previously , students had to earn a 300 on the 10th-grade FCAT to graduate high school.
Every state exempt from the act will have its own regula-
tions to determine its success, he said. 
“Florida has really worked hard to set 
reasonable standards and assessments for students,” Boyd said. “I don’t think we need federal government involved. It isn’t 
their job.”
John Russell, Teach For America mem-
ber at Robert E. Lee High School in Jack-sonville, said with the FCAT approaching, the focus is more on helping students pass the test than on the waiver being granted.
“I don’t think a lot of people are talking about it yet,” he 
said. “Because most of the changes will affect next school year.” Florida exempt from No Child Left Behind

The Alachua County Sheriff’s Office 
arrested another man Friday in its un-
dercover child-sex sting.
Manuel S. Hudson, 33, of Ocala, 
was charged with four counts of ob-scene communication after exchanging emails and text messages with whom he thought was a 14-year-old girl and her stepfather.
Hudson is the 23rd suspect arrest-ed as part of Operation Tailfeather, a joint investigation between the Ala-chua County Sheriff’s Office and the Gainesville Police Department.
He is the second person arrested 
since both agencies held a press confer -
ence announcing the operation Tues-day. At the time, officers said they did not expect any more arrests because they didn’t think suspects would take the bait in a sex sting local news outlets covered.
On Jan. 30, Hudson responded to a Craigslist ad posted by ASO detective William Patten, who pretended to be a 38-year-old man seeking “help” for his stepdaughter. He and Hudson ex-changed emails, and Hudson implied he would like to have sex with the girl, according to an arrest report.
Patten also pretended to be the 14-
year-old girl. Hudson offered to teach her about sex, according to police.
Hudson was in San Antonio when 
he started communicating with the man and the girl, but he told them he would be back in town Friday. They arranged to meet in Gainesville, and officers ar -
rested Hudson at 10 a.m. Friday.

Liz Ohrablo aimed a yellow, gun-
shaped thermometer and pulled the 
trigger. The red laser was connected to a student-made air purifier. She said she saw the thermometer jump from 150 to 1,000 degrees as the purifier killed mi-crobes in the air.
“That’s crazy,” she said. “Can you 
put that in your house?”
The 20-year-old economics junior 
was just one in the crowd at the Phillips Center on Saturday at the third-annual TEDxUF event.
UF’s TED Club put on TEDxUF, 
which uses the name and format of a nonprofit conference known for its se-ries of videos of prominent speakers.
This year’s event brought more than 
double the crowd last year’s did. The 1,600 free tickets were gone in three weeks, but 1,200 people attended the event, said UF’s TED club president Ben Erez. About 1,000 attendees registered early, and the rest were standbys wait-ing outside.
The event relocated to the Phillips 
Center from the smaller Constans The-atre, and the number of speakers in-creased from eight to 13, he said.
The event cost $18,000, said Erez, who was in charge of fundraising and finding the speakers. All of them came for free, he said. UF bodies such as Stu-dent Government and the Office of the Provost helped fund it.
Jacob Atem, a UF graduate student, 
gave a lecture in which he talked about how he was displaced by a civil war in Sudan and became president of the Southern Sudan Healthcare Organiza-tion. Neurologist Dr. Michael Okun and neurosurgeon Dr. Kelly Foote showed videos about controlling the brain with electric signals.
Twenty local businesses and insti-
tutes also showcased new devices and business practices.
“It was like an idea Woodstock,” 
Erez said. “We brought so many di-verse speakers and ideas that everyone found something.”
Twenty-year-old industrial engi-
neering junior Cameron Kass said the speakers during the first half of the event were too focused on raising awareness for their organizations.
“I didn’t take much interest in it,” he 
said. “I didn’t come here to see a com-mercial.”
Ohrablo said she was most excited 
to see Morris Morrison, the motivation-al speaker who closed the event with his lecture “Redefining Success.” She said she wanted to see innovations in thought and technology.
“The world is constantly changing, 
and TED stays on top of that,” she said.TEDxUF event features

Two political parties will be shoving Stu-
dent Government elections fliers at students 
on campus this week, but 10 other prospec-tive parties were registered when candidates started qualifying.
Unite Party members and supporters reg-
istered old party names for the Feb. 21 and 22 elections, but the parties did not field any candidates for the elections when the Unite Party and Students Party did in January.
Supervisor of Elections Toni Megna said 
when a party name is registered, no one else can use that name.
Unite Party spokeswoman Christina 
Bonarrigo registered as president of the Swamp Party.  
She said members of the Unite Party reg-
ister other party names as tradition. Whoever registers a party is the party’s president.
She said party members did this during 
Fall 2011 and Spring 2011 elections.
“We do that every semester in case we 
change names or use a different name,” she said. She didn’t know if the Unite Party name was chosen this way.
According to the SG election codes, a 
political party may not select a name that is similar to a party that has campaigned in the last three election cycles.
Also, a party cannot have the same name 
as any student organization registered with the Center for Student Activities and Involve-ment or a name that the Supervisor of Elec-tions determines might cause confusion.
The 10 prospective party names were used 
in elections from more than three cycles ago.
During the fall elections, five parties were 
registered besides the Unite Party and the Students Party. However, SG does not keep files beyond that.
Because these party names do not re-reg-ister, they get deleted, said Student Activities and Involvement program coordinator Ra-chel Rollo.
She said the names are registered as stu-
dent organizations but get deleted after the year like any other inactive organization.
This year’s registered names will remain 
in the database until September, she said.
Anyone is allowed to register a prospec-
tive political party. However, to be qualified as a political party, a prospective party must have candidates for Student Body president, vice president and treasurer and have at least six candidates for the Student Senate.
This is Rollo’s first year working with SG 
elections, but she said there are usually more names registered than the ones that run.
Current Unite Party Agriculture Sen. Ka-
tie Waldman registered as the president of the Key Party.
She said she knew the deadline to register 
was coming up, and she wanted to exercise her right as a student to register a party. Old parties registered for elections

Blake shuffled his feet, wagged his 
tail and danced around in his cage as 
potential families looked on.
Blake, a 3-year-old bulldog mix, 
was among the 30 dogs, cats and pup-pies available for adoption during the “Share the Love” event at the Subaru of Gainesville dealership Saturday.
The event, sponsored by Alachua 
County Animal Services, had a bake sale, information booths and a collec-tion of animals waiting to find a new home.
“If you didn’t have somebody for 
Valentine’s Day, this is an excellent opportunity to get somebody for Val-entine’s Day: a little, four-legged one,” said Hilary Hynes, public education program coordinator for the Alachua County Animal Services. “This is the best kind of love.”
About 100 people and pets attended 
the event.
For each animal adopted, Subaru of 
Gainesville donated $100 to Paws on Parole.
Anne Shelton, a volunteer with Ala-
chua County Animal Services, said two pets from the organization’s selection were adopted Saturday.
One of them was Ranger, a 3-month-
old German shepherd and labrador mix, who was adopted for 3-year-old Anastasia Rosa by her parents.
Second Chance Farms, a nonprofit 
animal rescue and rehabilitation orga-nization, had its own collection of cats, dogs and puppies available for adop-tion.
Amy Tate, Second Chance Farms di-
rector, said the organization’s animals were rescued from the Alachua County Animal Services’ euthanasia list.
“I absolutely love the fact that we 
don’t just take in healthy dogs, but we are also taking in dogs that would not have a second chance without our help,” she said.Puppies from shelter find homes in time for Valentine’s DayReader response

Caution Advised
Law enforcement should 
be careful on roads  
Have you ever seen a police car dart past you on the 
highway without its emergency lights on, thinking it wasn’t fair for the officer to be able to do that? Have 
you ever wondered if those reckless police officers caused an accident?
A new investigative report about crashes involving law 
enforcement by the Orlando Sentinel discovered some pretty disturbing statistics.
The report found that in Florida from 2006 to 2010, law en-
forcement vehicles were involved in about 7,400 — or one out of every 44 — crashes each year. Considering that police are supposed to protect public safety, these figures are certainly surprising.
The report goes on to reveal some other startling findings. 
The Sentinel found that during this period, “crashes involving officers caused more than $126 million in property damage,” not including “medical expenses or legal claims paid to people who were hurt or the families of those killed.” About 20 peo-ple are killed each year and about 2,400 people are injured by crashes involving law enforcement.
Those numbers might be justifiable — although not entirely 
excusable — if these accidents occurred during high-speed chases or emergency situations, but the report found that most of these accidents happened under normal driving conditions.
The data also revealed that officers involved in these acci-
dents were rarely ticketed for their transgressions, even if they were at fault. While average drivers are ticketed 64 percent of the time, law enforcement officers “are cited less than 11 per -
cent of the time,” the report said.
So, not only is the reckless driving of police officers caus-
ing needless accidents, but they are getting away with it with-out penalty. For a group of individuals with as much power as police and law enforcement officers, this has some serious systematic repercussions for our safety.
Cops are not and should not be above the law; otherwise, 
what is the point in having laws in the first place?
Perhaps we should allow some privileges to law enforce-
ment officials if they are genuinely trying to protect public safety. However, the idea of offering near immunity for these actions have absolutely no rational justifications.
Paul Sireci, president of the Florida Police Chiefs Associa-
tion, agreed that the statistics were “concerning,” but said that it was not a high number, given the approximate 51,000 police officers in the state.
To be fair, this is just one report and it would be inappro-
priate to make sweeping accusations against all police officers from these numbers.
However, this should make all of us a little more wary of the 
power of law enforcement, especially in the sense that there ap-pears to be hardly any accountability for accidents they cause.Love can hurt like a bout with Taco Bell
Warning: Parts of this column may be difficult to stomach, much like Taco Bell. Discretion ad-vised.
During my time here, I have regrettably picked up an un-
fortunate coping mechanism: using Taco Bell as a rebound. As a result, the Taco Bell menu and I have a complicated on-again, off-again relationship. No matter how much I try to leave, I always find myself back beneath its hanging yellow vertical clearance bar that reads, “You must be this high to order.”
Unlike the Taco Bell dollar menu, I’m not a man of many 
options. I have more learning disabilities than sexual part-ners. When a guy dumps, rejects and/or rope-burns me, I turn to Taco Bell, for it is always there for me — the best friend who wishes I would choose him over those who keep breaking my heart.
At one point, I ate Taco Bell for every meal. I hated ev-
erything then, even Betty White. I’d given up on men and, one week in, my bowels gave up on me — declaring civil war and seceding from my union. Thankfully the Quilted North won the war, signing the Defecation Proclamation and getting my G.I. back on tract. I would never subject my-self to a full day of Taco Bell ever again.
I meditated on the event for a while and discovered what 
I call “The Five Stages of Taco Bell”:
1) Craving, 2) Waiting, 3) Bliss, 4) Coma of denial and 
5) Regret.
Soon after, I came to realize the stages mirror the pro-
gression of my encounters with men.
Craving: The part of the relationship where both parties 
involved want to see each other. You get invited places, they cancel plans to see you and they even cook for you, mak-ing hollandaise sauce from scratch! It’s the Cheesy Gordita Crunch because the Cheesy Gordita Crunch is the item cur -
rently featured in Taco Bell commercials. It wants you just as much as you want it, and it isn’t afraid to say so.
Waiting: The part where you’re inching toward making a move. Taco Bell has dropped hints, winking with ads proclaim-ing cheesiness and crunchitude. You’ve been hurt by Taco Bell be-fore, but you think you’re ready to love again. This is the 89-cent Cheese Roll-Up — unsatisfying, driving you to further action (and the drive-thru).
Bliss: The part where you’re 
touching each other. The bag of burritos enters the car. You want to feel it between your lips, but, alas — the road. At a red light, you can’t help yourself: You seize a burrito. The oddly shaped lump unwraps faster than your chastity khakis that have buttons instead of a zipper but make your butt look fantastic. Eventually you get home and, in a blur of consumption, it’s inside you and you feel like a Crunch Wrap Supreme, full of meat and sour cream. Above all else, you are happy.
Coma of Denial: The part where you’re complacent. 
Though the initial fire has gone, you’re floating on cloud nine. You had your Crispy Potato Soft Tacos and they tasted great. Even though your burritos have stopped returning your calls and texts, you don’t worry. You know they care about your feelings. If something bad were brewing, you’d have heard by now.
Regret: The part where all hell breaks loose. You feel a 
rumble in your lower intestines, sensing you’re physically ill. The burritos say you should start seeing other people — in this case, the toilet. No matter what you say or do, they’re going to leave you.
Eating Taco Bell and loving are one and the same. 
Though you know Taco Bell will hurt you in the end, the good times make it all worth it. And at least you know what to expect.

The students should elect 
their representative
In Tallahassee on Thursday 
night, UF Student Body President 
Anthony Reynolds, leader of the Unite Party , lobbied state leaders about pending legislation. No, he wasn’t lobbying to stop the rise in tuition and fees, as the Unite Party’s election platform promis-es. Nor was he there to advocate for Bright Futures. Instead, Reyn-olds was lobbying for a bill that would take power on the Florida Board of Governors away from students and give it to Gov . Rick Scott.
Currently, the student repre-
sentative on the Board of Gover -
nors is elected through the Flori-da Student Association, a student advocacy group made up of Stu-dent Body presidents from 10 of Florida’s 11 state universities. The FSA brings the 300,000 stu-dent voices in the state university system together to fight for our rights on matters such as budget cuts, tuition hikes, increased fees, textbook affordability and more. Membership is now free and all universities have an equal oppor -
tunity to run for chairmanship.
The Unite Party wants to stop 
students from electing the person who will lobby for our rights at the Florida Capitol and instead leave the choice up to Scott. While we’re at it, we might as well ask President Machen to ap-point the Student Body president for us, too.
Fellow Gators, Unite is not 
fighting against tuition hikes on your behalf in Tallahassee. In-stead it is lobbying to give away the one position where our voices are really heard.
For three years, the Unite Par -
ty has promised to advocate for students, and now it’s sacrificing our only way doing of so.
I believe the most important 
student position in the state of Florida shouldn’t be handed over to the Governor’s office. I believe students should elect for themselves the individual they want fighting for their rights in Florida’s public university sys-tem.
This is why, if elected Stu-
dent Body president, I will run for chairman of FSA. I will work with the Board of Governors and the state legislature to stop tuition increases, to improve the affordability of textbooks and to preserve our rights.
On Feb. 21 and 22, your vote 
will determine if we lose our voice on the Board of Governors. If you vote Unite, there is no guarantee we will keep our right to choose who represents us. If you vote for the Students Party , we will work tirelessly to fight this harmful legislation.
If you choose not to vote, your 
voice may never be heard in Tal-lahassee again.

§ § §Syria has been completely 
neglected
“If a tree falls in a forest and 
no one is around to hear it, does 
it make a sound?” This famous query, attributed to the 18th-century Irish philosopher George Berkeley , seems all too relevant today concerning our humanitar -
ian apathy.
In the spirit of celebrating the 
312 years since the inception of this thought experiment, it seems apt to ask: If more than 200 ci-vilians are slaughtered in a sys-tematic manner within a 3-hour window and their deaths don’t receive appropriate media cover -
age, does the loss of life make any difference in the world?
While most of us would be 
content with reading more of Berkeley’s thought experiments, let us for a brief moment come to terms with reality . For more than a year, the people of Syria have been protesting against the Syr -
ian government, and the current regime has brutally suppressed the call to political freedom and end to autocracy.
While I hesitate to bombard 
you with numbers, the situation in Syria coupled with a lack of coverage of the massacres in this newspaper compel me to enu-merate a few casualty figures.
According to the latest re-
ports, more than 6,000 civilians have been killed and 1,500 in-jured. According to The New York Times, tens of thousands are behind bars simply for making their voices heard in a country ruled by single tyrannical family for more than 40 years.
Since last week, government 
forces have escalated their cru-elty against the civilian popula-tion. During a span of 3 hours last Friday , more than 200 Syrian civilians were massacred in the city of Homs. This Wednesday , between 40 and 100 more inno-cent lives were lost.
As you read this column at 
your RTS bus stop, the blood of Syrians, old and young, is pour -
ing down the streets of the capi-tol of the Syrian revolution. 
The paucity of coverage of 
the bloodbath in Syria becomes depressing when we consider ourselves “global citizens.” The struggle and fight for freedom and justice, whether you support the “revolutionaries” or not, will carry on and eventually (at least theologically speaking, if one believes in divine justice) will be victorious. For each life being sacrificed at the altar of social jus-tice, un-Obama-like change will come to fruition, perhaps genera-tions later.
At the end of the day , the 
question becomes simple: Would you rather spend your free time complaining about the declining quality of Lupe Fiasco’s rap or get on the “right” side of history by raising awareness and donat-ing money to the aid agencies working for Syria?

What a week to be a Catholic. 
The Obama administration has looked 
panicked in recent days because of the 
backlash against a new proposal scheduled to go 
into effect because of the Obamacare legislation shoved through in March of 2010.
Preventative care is supposed to be offered at 
no cost to the plan participant, and Health and 
Human Services has decided this preventative definition extends to procedures surrounding re-productive health.
The White House is backtracking because many 
Catholics who often support higher social spend-ing and taxes  — and thus helped push through the 
health care legislation — are offended that their 
organizations are now being forced to pay for something they view as morally wrong.
Obama needs every Catholic vote he can get, 
and he certainly can’t afford to anger the Confer -
ence of Bishops that just recently announced it op-position to the administration’s compromise of not forcing these religious groups to pay directly but still having contraception paid for through other sources.
The problem is that nothing is free. The cost of free contraceptives to women in 
these religious organizations will be passed on to people in the form of higher health care costs. 
To be fair, men are a big reason why women 
need access to contraceptive devices. 
But to assess a tax that pays for a practice 
deemed morally objectionable by some religious groups sets a dangerous precedent for the ever-expanding welfare state.
If this birth control exception is allowed for 
faith-based groups, you can add it to the list of government programs that clergymen are allowed to opt out of.
Other such programs include Social Security 
and Medicare taxes, which eat into 7.65 percent of a worker’s salary — even more if they work for themselves. 
Why should we protect religious citizens work-
ing for religious institutions from the punitive current and future cost of free everything when everyone else has to pay?
The answer: Liberty is being cut back in Amer -
ica, and certain exceptions must be made so these changes are politically tol-erable. 
At the beginning of 
1937 when the govern-ment started collecting Social Security taxes, it amounted to 1 percent of a person’s salary. 
Today the amount is 
6.2 percent of your pay and 12.4 percent if you work for yourself. 
Medicare taxes continue to rise, and Obamacare 
has added an extra 2.9 percent tax on investment income that nobody seems to notice or care about because it hasn’t been levied yet.
Back in 2009, when health care reform was be-
ing debated, I supported it wholeheartedly, partly because I supported Obama. 
Unfortunately, I was naive enough to believe 
that when you give something away for free, it ac-tually becomes cheaper. 
The new rule on birth control will limit the in-
centive to provide new, cheap, easily accessible methods to prevent pregnancy.
Since contraception will now be covered in full 
by mandate, it will become a lot more expensive over time, just as all our entitlements have be-come.
The true nature of Obamacare, with its man-
dates, complex rules and tax increases, was ob-scured so that it would pass. 
Luckily for exempted employers, some of these 
statist policies will not be applied to them because of their belief system.
The only reason the White House wants to ex-
tend these exceptions is it needs the votes of lib-eral Catholics to win in 2012. 
The rules that would be objectionable to a large 
part of the population should not have been forced down people’s throats in the first place.
I’m all for people having access to cheap and ef-
fective birth control, but the administration should stop trying to tell people what to do. 
It seems that politicians of both political parties 
are at their worst when trying to legislate matters of the bedroom.

  Born into a well-off family in the 
Philippines, Erwin Felicilda grew 
up with maids who ﬁ  lled his cup of water when he tapped it against the table.
  He wouldn’t always have it so 
easy.
  His family moved away from 
that opulent lifestyle to an apart-ment in Illinois — via a stint in New Mexico — before he was a teenag-er.
  He went from maids cleaning 
his room to doing chores for the ﬁ  rst time in his life.
  “It was a wake-up call,” he said. 
“I didn’t know what to do.”
  Growing up in America, he 
was bullied because of his ethnic-ity. Things didn’t start looking up until his family made a move to Gainesville in 1998.
  Felicilda, 27, is a young 
Gainesville businessman who went from rich to poor to college dropout to success. Even in a tough econo-my, he saw it through.
  In the last three years, he started 
two businesses of his own.
  According to the U.S. Small 
Business Administration, seven out of 10 new businesses in the U.S. survive at least two years, and half survive at least ﬁ  ve years.
  “I could make a website in an 
hour for $50 and sell it for $100,” Felicilda said.
  He always knew he wanted 
to work in business. He liked fast cash, and he thought higher educa-tion was the way to go. He enrolled at Santa Fe College.
  Even though he had good inten-
tions, college didn’t really turn out to be what he expected.
  “I never wanted the experience 
of learning to be conﬁ  ned in a class-room setting,” he said. “I wanted to step out from the status quo, and knowing that a number of people have done it successfully, I could do the same with the proper mindset.”
  When he was 21, he dropped out 
of college to focus more on starting his own businesses.
  His ﬁ  rst success came in 2009, 
when he was 24, after a few years of working in sales and marketing.
  He built, sold and auctioned 
websites based on popular Google searches. This sparked his ﬁ  rst com-pany, NewaveDezign.
  He designed a website based on 
the Japanese anime character Nar-uto. It was ﬁ  lled with articles and links to Naruto gifts on Amazon.com. The website gained enough trafﬁ  c for him to sell it for $400. It was the ﬁ  rst taste of many success-ful website sales.
  Using a site called Flippa, he 
auctioned the websites to the high-est bidder.
  With his money, he traveled 
around the world, visiting coun-tries like Germany, Spain and the Philippines.
  He launched his next company, 
KnownMedia, in 2010. It’s a mar-keting company that focuses on web design, social media manage-ment and video marketing.
  His company also makes apps.  An app called “Ab Workouts” 
contains videos of exercises and an e-book that explains how to get a six-pack. It hit the top 10 ab work-out apps on Android with more than 5,000 downloads, he said.
  For Tim Tebow fans, Felicilda 
created an app called “Tim Tebow,” which has news about the Broncos, interviews, pictures and links about the famous football player.
  Now, at 27 years old, he consid-
ers himself a “nomadic entrepre-neur,” always traveling and creat-ing new businesses.
  Though KnownMedia is still 
active, Felicilda said he’s stepping back so he can concentrate on a new start-up business.
  “I’m always excited to start new 
ventures,” he said, “especially if it’s a challenging one.”
  InforMeta SEO, which will 
launch in the beginning of March, is a private label search engine op-timization company. Felicilda said it will help business websites gain trafﬁ  c by having sites show up at the top of search engines.
  Felicilda and his business part-
ner Dalton Bateman are in the pro-cess of signing a lease downtown. Until then, Felicilda works from home.
  He said he likes Gainesville be-
cause it’s the best place for start-up businesses and has a potential for growth.
  Between 2004 and 2007, small 
businesses in Gainesville had a growth rate of 7 percent. In 2007, 5,937 businesses were established in Gainesville compared to, on av-erage, 11,214 in all mid-sized met-ropolitan areas, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
  Anjali Kundra, vice president of 
client relations at a start-up compa-ny called RoomSync in downtown Gainesville, agrees with Felicilda.
  “Gainesville is a hub for inno-
vation and entrepreneurship,” she said. “There’s so much growth for businesses and opportunities for young people.”  8, ALLIGATOR   MONDAY, FEBRUARY 13, 2012

Russell Welker from Tree of Life Wine, right, pours a sample of merlot for Erik and Marcy Bayard at the 
Hippodrome’s 30th anniversary party on Saturday night.
Money from celebration will fund theater’s sound system improvements
The food was gone within sec-
onds, said Brad Hersch, a mar -
keting intern at the Hippodrome 
Theatre.
“I literally blinked, and eight 
trays of pizza were gone,” he said.
Shirley Lasseter, director and 
co-founder of the Hippodrome Cinema, said most of the food and wine at the event was donated by Ward’s Supermarket and other sponsors.
Lasseter said her biggest chal-
lenge over the last three decades has been to create excitement and motivate people to come to the cinema rather than stay home and watch movies from the comfort of their sofas.“With a great, smart commu-
nity and smart, cultured people striving to learn new things and gain new perspective, we try to fill their void,” Lasseter said. “But if we don’t continue to grow a new audience and engage them, eventually we’ll cease to be.”
Hersch said students do not 
take advantage of the great land-mark.
“More students should take op-
portunity of the cultural landmark that’s just in their backyard,” said Hersch, a 20-year-old English and advertising junior.
Lasseter said the experience of 
watching a film at the cinema is more engaging than one at a mov-ie theater because there are often discussions following the films.
She said the cinema tries to in-
vite speakers to talk about a par -
ticular issue and sometimes holds Skype chats with film directors to talk about their films after the screening.
“You just can’t beat it,” Lasseter 
said.HIPP , from page 1
About 1,400 accepted into Innovation Academy’s inaugural class
The numbers are similar to last year’s, 
but about 250 more students were admit-
ted for the Summer B session. About 3,300 students were accepted for Summer B 2012.Orlando said he expects about 6,400 
of those accepted for summer and fall to enroll. Innovation Academy has an enroll-ment goal of 500.
“I think it shows that lots and lots of 
students in Florida are still very interested in coming to UF,” he said. “We continue to get the best and the brightest.”
UF uses a holistic approach to admis-
sions that evaluates students on more than just their test scores. 
Still, the process remains competitive 
and rigorous, he said.
Newly accepted Gator Travis Lefke, an 18-year-old from Citrus County, said he only applied to UF.
When he learned that he was accepted, 
Lefke jumped around and ran outside to call his friends and family.
“I’m beyond excited,” he said. “Over -
whelmed. Overjoyed.”FRESHMEN , from page 1“More students should 
take opportunity of the cul-
tural landmark that’s just in 
their backyard.”

Florida forward Will Yeguete will miss Tuesday’s game against Alabama after suffering a concussion and serious lac-
eration above his right eye in Saturday’s loss to Tennessee. Yeguete leads UF in rebounding percentage this season.
� THE FORWARD IS OUT FOR TUESDAY’S GAME.
JOHN BOOTHE
Alligator Staff Writer
  
In the two minutes Will Yeguete spent on the court Sat-
urday, he created havoc. 
Twenty-two seconds after first subbing in against Ten-
nessee, Yeguete, complete with his trademark mohawk and 
a heavily taped right hand, had already stolen an inbounds pass from UT’s Cameron Tatum.
Three Tennessee possessions later, Yeguete, a sopho-
more forward, elevated to block Jarnell Stoke’s breakaway layup off the backboard. 
The O’Connell Center crowd immediately erupted into 
cheers, not realizing, at first, Yeguete crumpled on the floor.
As quickly as he came into the game and sparked the 
Gators defensively, Yeguete was gone and heading to the locker room.
“Definite concussion and I would say right now out in-
definitely,” UF coach Billy Donovan said. “I think eight-to-10 stitches across his eye. ... He wasn’t even conscious — like wasn’t even awake when I was over there.” 
The Gators played the rest of their deflating 75-70 loss 
without Yeguete. 
Donovan said in his postgame press conference that 
Yeguete failed his concussion test and, on Sunday night, announced he would not play Tuesday at Alabama.
During the next 4:12 following Yeguete’s head-first fall 
into the stanchion, Tennessee put together a 15-4 run and went on to lead by as many as 17 points in the opening half.Yeguete absence

In the final day of the USF Soft-
ball Tournament, Florida notched 
its fourth and fifth wins of season against USF and Florida Gulf Coast.
The Gators squeezed out a 3-2 vic-
tory against the Bulls in extra-innings in front of a record-breaking USF Softball Field crowd of 1,261. 
The pitching matchup between 
freshman Lauren Haeger of Florida and sophomore Sara Nevins of USF was evenly matched, as each went into the sixth allowing just one run.
“USF played a really good ball-
game,” Florida coach Tim Walton said. Gators finish opening 
weekend with two winsIt was only a matter of time before those 
three dreaded letters were bandied about. 
N-I-T.On a yearly basis, coach Billy Donovan 
uses them as an alarm. They cut to the core of his players, inspiring desperation and fear. No one wants to play in the NIT. 
After losses to Richmond and South Ala-
bama in 2010, the NIT talk popped up. Last year it came following defeats at the hands of UCF and Jacksonville. 
And now, even with a No. 7 national 
ranking, the NIT chatter is back after Flori-da lost 75-70 to Tennessee on Saturday. 
Donovan invoked the memory of UF’s 
2009 team — which started 18-3 before los-ing seven of its last 12 — to try to teach the Gators the im-portance of matur -
ing and becoming mentally tougher. 
In reality, Florida 
would have to lose five of its last six 
regular season games and then fall in the first or second round of the Southeastern Conference Tournament to even reach the bubble. 
Still, Donovan was right to play the NIT 
card when he did. 
“You’ve got to say that to wake a team NIT warning nothing but a 
glorified wake-up call for UF

up,” Kenny Boynton said. “That’s the reality of the situ-
ation.”
‘Wake up’ is the operative phrase, because that’s all the 
Gators really have to do. 
Florida’s loss Saturday was nothing more than a hang-
over from the Kentucky game, a 20-point beatdown that obviously took a heavy physical and mental toll. 
UF’s energy lull let a tough Tennessee team dominate 
inside, where the Vols had a 36-30 rebounding edge and outscored UF 36-14. Florida’s offense was off beat and out of sync, leading to 39 percent shooting over the first 39 minutes and 15 mostly careless turnovers. With sparkplug Mike Rosario and top energy man Will Yeguete out with injury, there was nothing to break UF from the funk.
Saturday’s drubbing is a wake-up call for the Gators to 
mature and focus, the same thing last year’s team had to do to make an Elite Eight run. It’s not a signal to hit the panic button or jump off the bandwagon, just a reminder that there’s still work to be done.  
If sports has shown us anything over the last year, it’s 
that peaking at the appropriate time is much more impor -
tant than avoiding losses like the one Florida had Satur -
day. 
Last year’s NCAA Champion, UConn, lost seven of its 
last 11 regular-season games before tearing off 11 straight to win the Big East and NCAA Tournaments. 
The Super Bowl Champion Giants lost five of six in the 
middle of the year to fall to 7-7, only to turn around and win it all. Before that, Alabama lost the “Game of the Century” to 
LSU and then exacted revenge in the BCS Title game. 
The St. Louis Cardinals were 67-63 late in August and 
had only a 1.3 percent chance of making the playoffs. They went on to win the World Series. 
Even the Dallas Mavericks were everyone’s sexy pick 
to get upset in the first round of the NBA playoffs after they lost four in a row a week before the end of the sea-son. Then Dirk Nowitzki became the best player in the world and propelled the Mavs to the title. 
How a team plays at the end of the year is far more 
important than any step along the way, and Florida’s loss Saturday — coupled with Donovan’s NIT wake-up call — could be the impetus the Gators need to get their issues corrected before the Big Dance.

Yeguete leads UF in offensive and defensive rebounding percentage
“We were obviously in some dilemmas 
personnel-wise,” Donovan said. “Patric 
(Young) played way too many minutes, as did (Erik) Murphy.”
With the Gators giving up 70-plus points 
in consecutive games for the first time in Southeastern Conference play, losing Yeg-uete, the team leader at 1.3 steals per game, for an extended period could damage more than the frontcourt’s depth.
Florida’s usually effective full-court press 
was crippled against Tennessee without the 6-foot-7 Yeguete working the front of the de-fense. 
Needing extra possessions to spark a comeback, the Gators’ pressure only gener -
ated four points off turnovers in the second half.
“He hurt from a pressing standpoint,” 
Donovan said. “We weren’t at our best pressing-wise.” 
Yeguete, who has eight steals in his last 
five games, is the only UF player to crack the top 25 in the conference in steals percentage.
His ability to create a steal on 3.51 percent 
of his defensive possessions is ranked fifth in the SEC this season, according to Kenpom.com, and is the second-highest Florida has had in the last five years.
Freshman guard Brad Beal, who is 27th 
in the league in steals percentage, said Yeg-uete’s absence was also noticed on missed shots. 
For the third time in five games, the 
Gators were out-rebounded, with the Volun-teers taking a 36-30 edge on the glass.
Though he is somewhat undersized at 
his forward position, Yeguete’s offensive and defensive rebounding percentages are Florida’s highest. 
“[Rebounding] was real tough, especially 
when Will went out,” Beal said. 
“And we just had Pat and Murph and 
they got in foul trouble and then we had to put Casey in there. We were real under -
sized, but at the same time, we have to fight through that.”

org.hoops , from page 13Hometown girl Horton lifts Florida with powerful hitting weekend
“Their pitcher pitched well. I 
thought she really did good.”
However, Nevins made a 
critical mistake in the top of the 
eighth, giving up a two-run home run to junior Kelsey Horton.
Horton took a 1-1 pitch over 
the left field fence, finally break-ing the tie that lasted for more than six innings.
“I could feel it,” Horton said. “As soon as I hit it, I knew it 
was gone. We have a lot of peo-ple that always come through, so I was just happy that it could be me.”
Walton knew how big of a hit 
it was for Horton, who is from Tampa and had family in atten-dance.
“It’s nice to have a home run 
in your bag of tricks if you need it,” Walton said. 
“She really pulled it out with 
one of the biggest hits of her ca-reer. It was special for her in her hometown, so it was nice.”
USF tried to stage a rally in the bottom half of the inning, scoring one to bring the game to 3-2. Its 
efforts were not enough, how-
ever, as sopho-more Hannah Rogers stepped up and shut the Bulls down.
In 2.2 innings, 
Rogers only al-lowed one hit in 
a winning relief performance. 
Approximately 30 minutes 
after Rogers threw her last pitch against USF, she got the start and dealt a three-hit shutout against Florida Gulf Coast to help UF win 5-0.
“Coming off of a tough game 
like (USF), I just had to stay con-fident in myself and go out there and throw like it was any other game,” Rogers said.
The game was originally 
scheduled for 8:30 p.m. Friday before being postponed by rain. It was tied at zero until the fifth inning, when the Florida bats fi-nally came alive.Horton came through with an-
other RBI, while freshman Sami Fagan and junior Brittany Schutte added two of their own.
A five run lead against the 
Eagles was plenty for Rogers, who has recorded four of the five Gator victories.
“I’m feeling good,” Rogers 
said. 
“But I feel like I can get better, 
there’s always room for improve-ment. I’m never satisfied with anything I do. But I’m proud of our team.”

Florida junior T.J. Vogel shot a final round 70 (E) to finish second 
individually Sunday at the SunTrust Gator Invitational.
KATIE AGOSTIN
Alligator Writer
 
When T.J. Vogel stepped into 
the sand trap on 18, he was able 
to get the ball out and stick it rela-tively close to the pin. After read-ing his line, he was ready to make his par putt. 
Instead, he missed.Despite a bogey on the final 
hole of the SunTrust Gator Invi-tational, Vogel finished the day at even par, making him three under for the tournament.
“I just didn’t execute some shots 
that I should have,” Vogel said. “I felt like everything was just a little bit off. I missed a few short par putts, and a few chips that I need-ed to get close to the hole.”
Vogel was hoping to get his 
second career win at home this weekend, but that honor went to Auburn’s Dominic Bozzelli, who also shot a 70 (E) to win by five strokes.
Vogel’s strong finish was good 
for second place, marking his fifth top-10 finish of the season. “It definitely gives me confi-
dence that even though I didn’t play my best, I still came in sec-ond,” Vogel said. “But obviously I wanted to win.”
Although Vogel had a solid fi-
nal round, the rest of the Gators had some difficulties. 
Florida dropped to third place, 
one stroke behind Arkansas and 17 behind Auburn. 
“When you lose by a shot, that’s 
a little bit tougher to take than when you lose by 10 or 12,” coach Buddy Alexander said. 
The Gators shot a final round of 
300 (+20). Memphis and South Al-abama were the only two schools out of 14 to have a worse final round, shooting a 305 (+25) and a 306 (+26). 
“I think I mentioned on Monday that we’ve been a little inconsis-tent, and it showed up [Sunday],” Alexander said. 
Redshirt senior Zach Lee came 
in 18th after shooting a tourna-ment total 218 (+8). His final round consisted of two birdies, six bogeys and a double bogey, and although it was not as impressive as his first day of play, Alexander was still pleased with his overall performance.
“Competitive golf is not like 
riding a bike,” Alexander said. “(There’s) a lot of rust to knock off, but in general I would say this week was a step in the right direc-tion for Zach.”
After watching some of his 
players struggle on the course Sunday, Alexander believes that some of their problems are han-dling adversity. 
“Anytime you let your emo-
tions get the best of you, typically in this game, bad things happen,” Alexander said. 
“Those are some of the things 
we’ll be working on, and we’ll get better at it.”

Coming off the high of a three-game winning streak, the 
Gators suffered yet another close loss.
Florida (16-9, 6-6 Southeastern Conference) fell to No. 24 
South Carolina (19-6, 8-4 SEC) 62-58 on the road Sunday. The 
defeat drops UF’s record in games decided by six points or fewer this season to 2-8.
“Both times we played South Carolina, we played a good 
second half and don’t show up for the first half,” coach Aman-da Butler said. “The first half, we were on our heels adjusting to everything they were doing from the opening tip.”
Similar to their previous losses, the Gators had multiple op-
portunities to come away with a win against the Gamecocks.
Florida arguably incurred the most damage from the 3-point 
line, posting a 26.7 percentage for the game. Meanwhile, South Carolina finished the day with a 61.5 percent clip from beyond the arc, boosted by a 7-of-10 effort in the first half.
The Gamecocks came into the game ranked last in the SEC 
with a 26.4 3-point shooting percentage.
“[South Carolina] just did a good job of finishing behind 
screens,” Butler said. “We had a lot of defensive miscues.”
Florida’s defensive play down the stretch helped put the 
Gators within striking distance. UF held South Carolina to just one made field goal in the game’s final five minutes.
However, the 
Gators also endured a dry spell, finishing the second half 1-of-
8 shooting with four turnovers. Butler said the error-prone play hampered UF in transition.
“(We) didn’t do a good job of stopping the momentum of 
their guards, didn’t do a good job of matching up,” Butler said. “They had individuals that, when they were left open, knocked down shots and made big plays in big times.”Both teams combined for just nine turnovers in a low-error 
first half but did not follow suit in the second. UF had 11 turn-overs after halftime compared to nine by the Gamecocks.
Junior forward Jennifer George had the best statistical day, 
notching team-high marks with 17 points and 10 rebounds.
George recorded her 13th double-double of the season and 
led Florida in scoring for the first time since putting up 15 points in a 61-37 win over Alabama on Jan. 19.
“[Getting George the ball] was an emphasis the whole ball 
game,” Butler said. “We just did a really poor job, especially the first five minutes of the second half, of passing to Jennifer.”
The loss to South Carolina drops UF to 6-6 in conference 
play, all but eliminating the Gators from the SEC race.
UF remains in competition for a top-four finish, which 
would guarantee a first-round bye in the SEC Tournament.
“We put ourselves in position, but didn’t take advantage,” 
Butler said. “We were just adjusting the whole game.”

� STANFORD WINS REMATCH 
OF LAST YEAR’S NCAA CHAMPIONSHIP. 
ELI MARGER
Alligator Writer
 
The Gators’ hopes of winning 
back-to-back national champion-
ships took a blow Sunday. 
No. 2 Stanford hosted No. 1 Flor -
ida and exacted their revenge for last year’s loss in the NCAA Cham-pionship, defeating the Gators 5-2.
In a match between the nation’s 
top two teams, Stanford was tested but never truly threatened by an overmatched Florida team. Coach Roland Thornqvist said that re-venge was definitely on Stanford’s minds.
“The same thing happened when 
we played them for the second time last year. It gives you that extra giddy-up. They were definitely the better team,” he said. “We gave it all we had, and I think we learned a lot. I hope we get the chance to play them again.”
Florida’s lone victories were by 
No. 3 Allie Will, who defeated No. 5 Nicole Gibbs in three sets, and No. 34 Sofie Oyen, who split the first two sets with No. 31 Ellen Tsay before winning the third-set super tiebreak. 
The weekend was not entirely 
lost for Florida’s women’s team, as it swept No. 27 Pepperdine 7-0 on 
Friday for its 26th consecutive vic-
tory. 
A week after 
being completely outplayed, Bob van Overbeek and the No. 5 Gators men’s team (5-1) bounced back in a 
big way, defeating Florida State and Illinois 6-1 on consecutive days.
Against the Fighting Illini, No. 
69 van Overbeek took down No. 2 Dennis Nevolo in straight sets, 7-6 (5), 6-4. Nevolo, an All-American who made it to the Round of 16 at the NCAA Championships last sea-son, was the most recent in a string of nationally-ranked players van Overbeek faced. 
The Gators junior, who has been 
challenged all year with playing at the No. 1 slot in the singles rota-tion, broke through against Nevolo. Jackson said the key to victory came earlier in the day during doubles play.
“The thing that was most impor -
tant was how he recovered his emo-tional stability in the doubles, which was the biggest point of the match,” Jackson said. “For our team, it was huge what he did for us in the dou-bles, he and Andrew Butz.”
The doubles team of van Over -
beek and Butz defeated Illinois’ Bruno Adelnour and Stephen Hoh in a hard-fought 8-4 match. Despite the score, it was a challenging con-test that clinched the doubles point for Florida. 
“We have confidence that Bob is 
among the best players in the coun-try. Big kid, great serve, good com-petitor, lot of ability,” Jackson said. “He had his first huge win against a top-five opponent today, but it’s not a huge surprise and I don’t think it will be the last.”
