BREAKING NEWS
Gators defense
player arrested
By MIKE McCALL attention.
Alligator Staff Writer Brown, 19, and Davis had left
mmccall@alligator.org party by the time officers arri
UF defensive tackle Gary Brown
was arrested early Sunday morn-
ing and charged with two counts
of misdemeanor battery after po-
lice said he slapped one female and
scratched another after they asked
him to leave a party.
Brown and a friend, Theodore
Davis, attended a party at The
Crossing at Santa Fe Apartments,
and when Davis was asked to leave,
he grabbed a fire extinguisher and
sprayed its contents on those near
him, according to a police report.
Alachua County sheriff's depu-
ties responded to the incident at 5:27
a.m., and upon arrival, they were
told by two females hosting the par-
ty that the 6-foot-4-inch, 275-pound
Brown slapped and scratched them.
Neither victim required medical[the
ved,
but they were arrested at a traffic
stop and booked into the Alachua
County Jail shortly before 8 a.m.
A five-star recruit from Greens-
boro West Gads-
den High School,
Brown did not see
any game action
as a freshman this
past season, and
his recent arrest
doesn't bode well
Brown for future playing
time.
The Gators signed three highly
rated defensive tackles in their 2010
recruiting class -Sharrif Floyd, Do-
minique Easley and Leon Orr -and
the team is expected to have to cut
two scholarships before the fall to
make the limit of 85.

Subway reopens in Reitz
By TATIANA QUIROGA
Alligator Contributing Writer
The revamped food stores on the ground
floor of the Reitz Union did not come cheap.
Aramark, UF's food provider, spent about
$520,000 to create the new Subway location, said
Reitz Union executive director Eddie Daniels.
The relocation of Freshbns and the addition
of the Provisions on Demand (P.O.D.) Market
cost about $456,000 and was paid for by Ara-
mark, the Reitz Union and the UF Business Ser-
vices Division.
Subway was relocated to the ground floor
of the Reitz Union and opened Saturday, while
Freshbns and P.O.D. Market, a convenience
store, opened Monday in the space across from
Subway.
Subway, Freshbns and P.O.D. Market loca-
tions are open from 9 a.m. to midnight daily.
"The new Subway location is larger and will
offer a three-line ordering system, which will in-crease speed of service for our customers," said
Jill Rodriguez, marketing program manager for
Gator Dining Services.
During Summer B of this year, the old Sub-
way location will be replaced by a Panda Ex-
press, she said.
"The new Subway location is larger
and will offer a three-line ordering
system, which will increase speed
of service for our customers."

Rodriguez said grand opening week spe-
cials will include a free cookie with a purchase
at Subway this week.
Interior design junior Xhylin Chediak said
she likes the new Subway location.
"It's a lot more space," Chediak said. "Sub-
way is always packed."Frat raises funds
-ABOUT 1,600 PEOPLE
ATTENDED THE EVENT.
By CJ PRUNER
Alligator Writer
Dressed in cheerleading outfits
bearing their letters, members of
UF's Greek community strutted
their stuff Monday in the second
annual Beta Bring It On philan-
thropy event sponsored by Beta
Theta Pi Fraternity.
Performing in front of about
1,600 people at the Phillips Center
for the Performing Arts, more than
a dozen sororities leaped and cart-
wheeled to the enthusiastic chants
of audience members.
The sororities each had their
own cheers promoting their orga-
nizations and praising Beta Theta
Pi.
Judges of the cheer competi-
tion included former Gators foot-ball players Riley Cooper and Joey
Sorrentino and Gators quarterback
John Brantley.
The group with the best cheer
earns a free limousine ride and a
megaphone award. The name of
the winning sorority was not avail-
able at press time. Event proceeds
go to the National Alzheimer's As-
sociation and the Thomas Oliver
Brown Scholarship, named after
a former Beta brother killed five
years ago at the Florida-
Greek Georgia game.Life Adorned in brightly
colored exercise shorts,
Eric Russell and Anthony Craw-
ford, both seniors in Beta Theta Pi,
acted as emcees for the event.
According to Russell, members
of Beta Theta Pi have been practic-
ing for months for the show.
"We're not just having fun;
it's also for a good cause," Rus-
sell said. "We're the right men for
something like this."
EUF senior center
fielder Matt den
Dekker is the
favorite to replace
Avery Barnes as the
Gators' leadoff hit-
ter this season. He
was at the top of
the order 29 games
the last two years.
See Story, Page 14.Two arrested after beating and leaving homeless man to die
Two St. Francis House residents were ar-
rested and charged with attempted murder
for beating a homeless man Saturday.
Anthony Fox, 38, and Beverely Thorton,
37, visited the victim, Thorton's ex-boyfriend
in his tent at Tent City, to pick up some of her
things, according to the Gainesville Police De-
partment report.
Fox cut into the tent, then punched the
man in the face, put a knife to his neck and
said, "I'm gonna kill you," the report stated.Thorton grabbed a tree limb and beat her
ex-boyfriend in the face, arm, knee and pelvis.
He was left unconscious, swollen, bruised and
bleeding heavily, police said.
The victim woke up six hours later and
called for help until someone took him to the
emergency room at Shands at UF. Fox ad-
mitted he "beat his ass with the stick" in self
defense and was found carrying a knife with
blood on it.

Graham Center
focuses on civic
engagement
In 2008, Florida
ranked 34' in voter
turnout. Some 70
percent of Florid-
ians report cutting
back on civic activi-
ties in the past year.
Our state faces a
civic crisis.
At the Bob
Graham Center for Ann Henderson
Public Service, these
statistics caused us to ask what contribu-
tion our university is making to prepare
students for active citizenship. In addi-
tion to the excellent education provided,
are we specifically training students to
become the citizens our democracy re-
quires, or do we assume that a fine -but
general -education is sufficient?
Derek Bok's book, "Our Under-
achieving Colleges" (2005), makes a
compelling case that colleges need to
do more. Bok will be at Digital Worlds
Institute at 3 p.m. on Feb. 23, to start
a dialogue that we hope will result in a
more visible focus on civic engagement.
The Bob Graham Center also has
received an Americorps grant, "Making
Citizens." This will assist in efforts to in-
crease the number of immigrant staff and
community members who take and pass
the citizenship exam, help new citizens
become active community members, and
train Americorps members/students to
become more engaged citizens.

'Extreme Makeover' has
UF connection
Most college students can't claim to
have worked on the set of a national televi-
sion show.
Ryan McGinn and Aaron Wilbur can.
Both students at the University of
Florida's College of Design, Construction
and Planning volunteered their time as pro-
duction assistants for "Extreme Makeover:
Home Edition," during its Gainesville build.
McGinn, from Sebastian, Fla., is a mas-
ter's student studying architecture. Wilbur,
from Melbourne, Fla., is a fifth-year
senior in landscape architecture.
They assisted with security, bever-
ages and food, and moving televi-
sion cameras and furniture. As fans
of the show, it gave them a chance
to see things from the other side. Gai"There is more to that show Mathan what TV viewers might think
actually happens," McGinn said.
According to Wilbur, the house
wasn't the only thing they built.
"You're around those people a lot and
you develop friendships with them,"
Wilbur said.
He is already making plans to work
with the show again someday.

Students of the Samuel Proctor Oral History Program, known as SPOHP,
will bring history to life in the Gainesville community during Black History Month.
"A lot of people on campus are pushing for major initiatives for black history," Paul Ortiz, director
of SPOHP, said.
University of Florida faculty and students of the SPOHP are working to preserve and promote lo-
cal history by educating the community on past projects in Mississippi, and by implementing similar
initiatives locally.
Ortiz led a small group of students on a research trip this past
summer to expose them to the prominent black history of Indi-
anola, Miss. For five days, the students recorded personal anec-
dotes of locals who experienced the civil rights movement.
The public is invited to a multimedia presentation of the Mis-
sissippi project from 6 to 8 p.m. on Feb. 17 at Gainesville's Civic
Media Center, 433 S. Main Sr. The presentation will include a
question-and-answer session with a panel of SPOHP students.
Currently the project interviews are in the process of being
uploaded as part of a digital library. Select narratives will be avail-
able through iTunes podcasts.
Candice Ellis, UF senior, conducted about five interviews
during the research trip. She said that hearing the stories really

at the town's Henry M. Seymour Because the oral histories are subjective, they provide deeper
Library. insight to history than a text book, Ortiz said.
"They can tell you what it feels like to step into a ditch
because a white person was walking on the sidewalk," Ortiz said. "Or how it feels to have to explain to
your daughter why she can't drink out of the water fountain."

Students share faith
0 TESTIMONIAL TUESDAYS TAKE
PLACE ON TURLINGTON PLAZA.
By ASHLEY WILLIAMS
Alligator Contributing Writer
Each week on Turlington Plaze, a
group of students participates in Testimo-
nial Tuesdays and tell stories about how
they became Christians, offering their
message to anyone who wants to listen.
"I know for me, when I'm out there,
it's amazing to hear what God has done,"
said Shawn Findlater, the group's found-
er. "He's really worked some miracles in
people's lives."
Right now, the participants are a few
members of Findlater's church at First As-
sembly of God. The group meets at 11:45
a.m.
Findlater said he got the idea to create
the group while he was praying because
he felt it would be a good way for others
to hear how good God is.
Findlater believes that giving a testi-
mony helps those who are listening relate
to the message.
Although there are various ways to
share beliefs, not every method is suc-cessful in making a connection with the
listeners.
"You can talk about what God says
and still not get across what God is," he
said.
Bringing people to God isn't the only
benefit the group gets from giving testi-
monies.
Wesla Bourdeau, a member of the
Rock of Gainesville's Rock Your Life pro-
gram, said that members of the group can
be reminded of how far their faith has
brought them and get a sense of fulfill-
ment of doing something
On asked of them.Campus "We're all called to be a
witness, and I think by giv-
ing our testimony we're being a witness
to God's grace," she said.
Bourdeau feels that using a person's
story to witness helps make a personal
connection to those listening.
According to Bourdeau, it draws
them in more than simply spout-
ing out rules and regulations.
But the best part for him is seeing how it
affects those who listen and truly take in
the message.
"You can see a glimmer of freedom in
their eyes, and you know that it's really
helping them," Findlater said.Talent show draws 200
By ASHLEY HEMMY
Alligator Contributing Writer
When four UF professors walked to the
front of room 109 in Little Hall, they didn't
start lecturing.
They sang a song in Chinese to the crowd
of about 200 students and faculty gathered
Monday night to celebrate the Year of the Ti-
ger at the Chinese New Year Talent Show.
Students stood up, clapped and sang
along. They also performed by singing,
dancing, reading poetry and performing a
"Finding Nemo" skit in Chinese at the talent
show, which was sponsored by the Asian
Studies program and the Department of
Languages, Literatures and Cultures.
The Chinese New Year began Sunday,
and the year of the tiger stands for bravery
and independence.
Students performed with energy, con-
fidence and humor. Many joked as they
performed and kept the audience laughing
throughout the show.
The audience clapped the most duringthe performance of a group of freshmen
who danced and sang to "Beijing huanying
ni."
The students pranced around the stage
as they sang the words in a range of differ-
ent pitches.
Between performances, the six emcees
led games like jeopardy and trivia, drew
raffles and handed out prizes.
"You perform because you don't
want to let your classmates
down."
John Mahoney
UF sophomore
Professor I-Chun Peir said participation
in the talent show is voluntary, but students
love the event.
John Mahoney, a sophomore Chinese
major, said students do not just perform for
themselves.
"You perform because you don't want to
let your classmates down," Mahoney said.

Constitution Amendments for the 2010 Spring Ballot
Fellow members of the Gator Nation:
As you may know, Student Government elections are upon us. While you may or may not vote in these elections, it is important that you know that this election is a bit different than most. Every 10
years, our student body Constitution demands that a Commission convene to draft revisions to our constitution, and this process has occurred over the last 14 months. The results of the
Commission's work will be on the ballot during this election and you will have the opportunity to accept or reject the changes. I write to you today, as the Chairman of this Commission, to encourage
you to vote in favor of these changes.
The 20 members of the Commission are proposing many important changes to our Constitution. The process was not a political process, but one designed to ensure that this important document
holds our elected leaders accountable, that this document is updated and current, and that our student body has access to our student courts and student leaders. Our changes lower the threshold
for impeachment for Student Senators that have been accused of official misconduct. We lowered the threshold to submit constitutional initiatives to the Student Supreme Court. In light of Florida
Board of Governors Resolution 08-23, we ensured the continued viability and presence of the former office of Honor Court Chancellor by creating a presidentially appointed position.
The 20 members of this Commission span the entire spectrum of our Gator Nation community. From Majority and Minority party senators, the Interim Dean of Students, the current Senate President
Pro-Tem, the current Chief Justice of the Student Body Supreme Court, the Director of Student Activities and Involvement, to many involved undergraduate, graduate, and law students. The result is
a comprehensive and united effort to help ensure that our student government, like our student body, remains unrivaled in reputation, both today and into the future. I would encourage you to review
the proposed changes and email me directly to discuss any questions you may have. We hope you will take the time to vote to pass this new Constitution.
Sincerely,
David M. Kerner
Chairman, 2009-2010 Constitution Revision Commission
3 LAW
dkerner@ufl.edu
On Behalf of the Full Commission: Taylor Tribou, Ben Cavataro, Thomas Cockriel, Matt Michel, Jay Miller, Naadira Renfroe, Dan Siegel, Jacqueline Acosta, Victoria Ajayi, Kirby Bissel, Brooke Eisen-
smith, Audrey Goldman, Kara Olesky, Frank Pierce, Whitney Smith, Josh Winegar, Dr. Paige Crandall (Interim Dean of Students), Dr. Nancy Chrystal-Green (Director of Student Activities and In-
volvement), Mr. Chris Loschiavo (Director of Student Conduct and Conflict Resolution).
Language as it will appear on the ballot:
Should the Student Body Constitution be amended to: change the time for appointment of Summer Replacement Senators from May 1 to
the last meeting of spring term; remove verbiage that purports to allow the Student Senate to contract on behalf of the student body;
permit the Student Senate to amend election laws within four weeks, rather than five weeks, of an election; comply with Florida Board of
Governors Resolution 08-23 by preserving the role of the Honor Code Chancellor, now referred to "Honor Code Executive Director," and
allowing this executive director to be appointed by the Student Body President; amend Article IlIl to read "Funding Fee Increase Restric-
tions", instead of "Budget Restrictions"; ensure that terms of executive department heads expire concurrently with the terms of the elect-

Feel Beta
Fundraiser too busy
stroking egos
Americans, the Editorial Board understands that
people stroke egos in exchange for money. When
bragging and brown-nosing rears its head in chari-
table events, however, we have to draw a line.
Beta Theta Pi's philanthropy raised money to fund a schol-
arship and combat Alzheimer's disease. It also raised our eye-
brows because the fraternity used sororities performing cheers
about their own houses to draw an audience.
Reliving their glory days as cheerleaders is one thing, but
the sisters focused on being judged for praising their groups.
The objective of the competition spotlights a glaring narcis-
sistic problem at an event which should humble the people
involved.
It seems to us that the Greek community tends to put up an
if-we-throw-money-at-a-charity-they-can't-say-jack shield to
defend from attacks on its self-serving entertainment choices.
As if setting up a contest to be told how great they are isn't
bad enough, we question the necessity of the cheers in the first
place.
Why would people train for months to sing the praises
of their own organizations? We're not saying cheers raising
awareness about Alzheimer's come by the dozen, but with
the time and effort used to practice, coach and set up for the
fundraiser, we're sure more people could have been helped.
Imagine if the practice times were used to build houses for
Habitat of Humanity, not to mention the potential power of
an ex-Gators football player's endorsement.
It's time for the people leading these events to redirect their
efforts away from vanity and toward the well-being of their
fellow men
NoSCAR
thing says love like
"Gentlemen, start
your engines!"
We can practically read the
Hallmark cards now: "You
rev my engine harder than
Dale Earnhardt Jr. Happy
Valentine's Day, honey. Now
hold my beer!"
Call us strange or even
outdated. But we at the Edito-
rial Board enjoyed our boxes
of chocolates and flowers our
significant others showered
us with on Valentine's Day.
We're sentimental. We're
sappy. And, most important-
ly, we're normal. Some of us
ruined special breakfasts we
planned for our sweethearts.
Some of us spent the day with
family. But none of us took
our honeys to the NASCAR
event of the season to watch a
500-mile race in a certain san-
dy town to the south called
Daytona Beach.And we can't seem to un-
derstand how others did.
Don't get us wrong, some
of us are very in tune with
our Southern roots. One of us
spent part of Valentine's Day
at the Bass Pro Shop in Orlan-
do. (We're judging, too.)
But for the most part, we
can't seem to understand the
concept of spending the holi-
day of love watching a set of
cars take 200 laps around one
big circle with thousands of
other NASCAR-jacket and
camoflauge-hat wearing, die-
hard fans hoping for a fiery
crash over a photo finish.
And does anyone else
think that whole pothole thing
delaying the Great American
Race is just a little bit funny?
We usually aren't particu-
larly fond of potholes, but this
one was like a special delivery
from Cupid himself -a Val-
entine's Day gift for all.

Unconditional love not a realistic goal
nconditional love is a strange thing to think about.It's often held up as the purest, most sincere sort
of love -the sort of special love that transcends the
pettiness and jealousy associated with most of the flawed
relationships that supposedly make up the majority of our
everyday connections.
Conversely, conditional love is often lambasted as some-
thing that doesn't even count as actual love. It's not really
love, some might argue, if you have to fit some criteria before
it's given to you.
This is all well and good for the universal sort of love that
we should give and feel for each other as members of the
human family. But for the specific, personal love that defines
our relationships with our friends and significant others, I'm
not completely sold.
It's a pretty bold statement to say that you love someone
unconditionally. That literally means that you have no condi-
tions on the love you offer them. There are no circumstances
under which you'll stop offering it, and there is nothing that
the recipient of your love can do that will cause you to cut
it off.
And that sounds dangerously close to a sort of emotional
enslavement -love that's offered involuntarily and without
limitation. Besides, being possibly unfair to yourself and eas-
ily abused by the unscrupulous sounds utterly unromantic.
It's akin to when people say "I need you" as a way of
conveying how much they love someone. Necessity is a poor
basis for love because, by definition, it can't be the basis of
selfless love; when you feel that you need someone, there's
always something intrinsically self-serving playing some role
in the decision to keep that person in your life. And thinking
back to the people I've loved the most in my life, it's not that
I needed them to be happy, it's just that there was no one I'd
rather share my happiness with than them.
On the other hand, the conditions we set on our love can
give it meaning. On the most basic level, it's a show of self-re-
spect to say that your love is important enough to give it onlyto those who demonstrate that they
value it. Loving someone uniquely,
the sort of love that gives the recipient
a warm feeling of being appreciated,
requires some measure of condition-
setting. Knowing that love can be lost
Joe Dellosa provides a reason to take steps to pro-let Dr lOa I I tect it.Ietters@alligator org But this might be an overly pedan-
tic way of looking at unconditional
love.
I don't think it's unreasonable to say that many aspects
of mainstream culture are conducive to making people feel
inadequate. As much as people talk about how overly feel-
good we've become, it's not hard to be told, implicitly or
otherwise, that we're not smart, interesting, pretty, funny,
put-together or just altogether worthwhile enough to be
worthy of consideration. Media messages, TV commercials,
cutthroat job interviews and hypercompetitive academia are
all more than happy to drive that home.
It's not hard to see how some stability of love could be ap-
pealing. If not unconditional love, then love with some room
for error. Or at least love that feels like it'd take some serious
scrubbing before it wears off.
Truly unconditional love is just as meaningless as love
based on too many conditions. Nobody should have to feel
that the love they're receiving is generic and unearned, nor
should anybody feel compelled to jump through hoops and
perpetually impress somebody to earn that love.
Ultimately, it's not really about unconditional love in
the strictest sense of the phrase. It's just about being aware
that you'll find no shortage of people who are willing to tell
you, "I'll love you only if .," and feeling a little appreciative
whenever you find someone of sound mind and judgment
who's willing to tell you, "I'll love you even if .."

Genocide, abortion not the same
enocide is the systematic and deliberateslaughter of a specific race, nationality or
culture. This term applies to what hap-
pened in the concentration camps in Hitler's Ger-
many, as well as to the slaughter of non-Arabic
people of Darfur, Sudan, by the militant govern-
ment. It does not apply, however, to abortion. No
matter how you feel about the issue of abortion,
everyone should be able to agree that it is not, at
least, a genocide.
No mother is going to get an abortion because
she doesn't want to propagate her own race or reli-
gion. Abortions are considered and undergone formany different reasons, but
genocide is not something
that is considered.

testers to have pictures of

STUDENT GOVERNMENT
Fliers create conflict
By ELIZABETH BEHRMAN
Alligator Writer
A war of words between the Unite Par-
ty and the Student Alliance party is already
underway even though students have a
week to wait before Student Government
elections.
Students found fliers critical of the
Unite Party placed on the windshields of
cars parked along Fraternity Row and So-
rority Row and distributed on the Plaza of
the Americas late last week.
The fliers featured the Unite Party sym-
bol and the message, "Obey?: A message
from Greeks for a Democratic campus."
In the Friday edition of the Alligator,
letters from students said the Student Alli-
ance party distributed the fliers.
But Jonathan Ossip, the Senate leader of
the Student Alliance party, said the party
did not distribute the fliers.
He said the letters were from students
who did not confirm who made the fliers
before attacking his party.
"I just think they saw this as an oppor-
tunity to attack their opposition, and they
did so with little regard for the truth," Os-sip said.
Unite Party spokesman Ben Meyers
said the Unite Party does not want to focus
on the message of the fliers, which were at-
tacking the Unite Party.
"We really want to concentrate on the
campaign, and hopefully stuff like that
doesn't happen," he said.
Part of the Unite Party's campaign in-
cludes a party video available on YouTube
and the Unite Party's Web site, uniteparty.
com.
The video was cre-
ated by Unite Party vol-
unteers and features stu-
dents expressing pride
in SG.
Nick Mildebrath,
campaign manager for
the Student Alliance
party, said his party's video is also avail-
able on the Student Alliance party's Web
site, ufstudentalliance.com and on You-
Tube. It includes students describing how
it is time for change in SG.
The Action Party could not be reached
for comment about its party platform or
campaign tactics.

"It's by showing these pictures
that we can make abortion un-

representative for the Center for
Bioethical Reform, an anti-abortionance. "Like slavery, 150 years from
now, people will look at [abortion]

Students had the chance to
voice their opinions and ask the
event staff questions during an
open microphone session.Most questions focused on the
differences between genocide and
abortion.
"The difference is that the [un-
born] are not aware of anything,"
UF freshman Kenya Johnson said.
"I think abortion is wrong most of
the time, but there is a difference."
Nick Tomlinson, a UF geogra-
phy senior, disagreed.
"[A fetus] is just a string of
cells," Tomlinson said. "It's not a
human yet. That's the difference."

UF looking for new leadoff hitter
By TYLER JETT
Alligator Writer
tjett@alligator org
Florida seems to have everything
figured out entering the 2010 sea-
son.
Coach Kevin O'Sullivan said the
No. 7 Gators are two-deep at every
position except for pitcher, where
UF has a stable of young, live arms
thanks to two-straight recruiting
classes ranked in the top five by
Baseball America.
UF also has the middle of its
lineup loaded with 2009 Southeast-
ern Conference Co-Freshman of the
Year Preston Tucker batting third
and newcomer Austin Maddox,
physically one of the biggest players
on the team, hitting cleanup.
"Losing Avery, it's a lot
from our lineup. He was
really tough to strike out
(and) had a knack for get-
ting on base. We're going
to look for someone to
hopefully fill that role."
Kevin O'Sullivan
UF baseball coach
But, with just three days left until
opening night, one important ques-
tion still lingers: Who's up first?
For the past two seasons, out-
fielder Avery Barnes was a constant
atop UT's lineup, hitting leadoff in
93 of 122 games. Barnes, who was
drafted in the 11th round by the
Colorado Rockies in July, led the
Gators in hits (90), stolen bases (18)
and runs scored (76) in 2009.
But now, Barnes is gone, and
O'Sullivan needs a new No. 1.
"Losing Avery, it's a lot from our
lineup," O'Sullivan said. "He was
really tough to strike out (and) had a
knack for getting on base. We're go-
ing to look for someone to hopefully
fill that role."
Senior center fielder Matt den
Dekker and freshman shortstop
Nolan Fontana are the leading
candidates to bat first this season,
O'Sullivan said.
Fontana, who is competing with
fellow freshman Cody Dent for a
starting shortstop position, hit lead-
off for the 2008 USA 18-U National
Team at the World Junior Champi-
onships. Although he said he's wil-UF center fielder Matt den Dekker returned to UF for his senior sea-
son despite being selected in the MLB Draft. Den Dekker will look to
improve from his disappointing junior campaign.
ing to hit anywhere, Fontana added
he's most comfortable batting first.
O'Sullivan said Fontana is patient
at the plate, can bunt well and is a
threat to steal bases -all character-
istics of a productive leadoff hitter.
But the favorite to bat first is den
Dekker, who hit leadoff in the 29
games Barnes didn't the past two
seasons.
Den Dekker was projected to be
an early selection in the 2009 MLB
Draft entering last season, and those
expectations negatively affected his
performance at the plate.
He said he pressed too much,
trying to pull home runs instead
of going the other way on outside
pitches."You say you're not worrying
about it," den Dekker said of the ex-
pectations. "You obviously have it
in the back of your head."
Not including a 19-game hot
streak, den Dekker hit .263 last year.
After falling to the 16th round
of the draft, where the Pittsburgh
Pirates selected him, den Dekker
elected to return to Gainesville.
Instead of playing in a collegiate
league or for Team USA, like he has
the past two summers, den Dekker
stayed on campus and tried to relax
after a disappointing year.
In the offseason, the coaches have
worked with den Dekker on hitting
outside pitches to the opposite field

* HE WILL REPLACE BRANDON McARTHUR AT
THIRD BASE.

Alligator Staff Writer

Bryson Smith has been impressed by the quality of
pitchers he has faced so far, and he has only seen action in
scrimmages against his teammates.
Smith, a transfer from Young Harris College, has not
played a game in a Gators uniform yet, but
he can already tell the difference from his
junior college days.
"I come down here and everyone is soBaseball good and so talented," he said. "So, it's
been quite a change from junior college
because there is not as much depth as there is here."
The adjustment at the plate shouldn't be a problem for
the junior third baseman, who will likely start at that spot
in No. 7 Florida's season opener Friday.
He won National Junior College Player of the Year last
season after hitting .467 along with 21 home runs and 90
RBIs.

Transfer likely to start at third
Harrison Diamond / Alligator Staff
UF coach Kevin O'Sullivan has been impressed with junior-college transfer Bryson Smith's dedi-
cation to improving his fielding this offseason.
Den Dekker top choice to replace Barnes
LEADOFF, from page 14
and becoming more comfortable against left-hand-
ed pitchers. Left-handed hitters like den Dekker
have more trouble recognizing pitches from south-
paws than they do from righties.
The coaches have also stressed putting the bat
on top of pitches to produce more ground balls.
"Matt runs so well that any ball hit on the
ground to the left side of the infield that the short-stop has to go to his right (den Dekker) has a chance
to beat out," O'Sullivan said.
Den Dekker also wants to be
more relaxed so minor slumps
don't become year-long prob-
lems.Baseball "(I) just go out there and have
fun every day playing something
I love," den Dekker said. "That's the way I'm going
to look at it this year. That's the way I'm going to
try and look at it for the rest of my career."INFIELD,from page 14
"Velocity was about the same
as junior college, but the off-speed
(pitches) guys have here is ridicu-
lous," Smith said. "It took a little ad-
justment to get used to."
He was limited during the fall be-
cause of a mid-June surgery on his
wrist, but Smith has been going at it
100 percent in the spring.
UF coach Kevin O'Sullivan envi-
sions Smith hitting either second,
fifth or sixth in the lineup. His speed
and ability to hit for contact make
him a viable option for the top of the
order.
His former coach at Young Harris,
Rick Robinson, remembers a point in
the 2009 season in which Smith had
only struck out twice through 100 at-
bats.
He finished the year averaging
only one strikeout for about every
nine at-bats.
Defensively, however, he did not
enjoy the same success.
Smith ended last season with 17
errors and a .899 fielding percent-
age.
But some of his problems with
the glove stemmed from the circum-
stances he was put under.
"The biggest thing for us was that
we really didn't know where Bryson
was going to play," Robinson said.
"We were moving him around an
awful lot. We didn't really give him
an opportunity to settle into a posi-
tion."
He saw time at second and thirdbase and in the outfield at Young
Harris.
But since coming to Florida, Smith
has worked solely at third, where he
will replace Brandon McArthur.
Smith takes 100 ground balls ev-
ery day from UF assistant coach Brad
Weitzel.
"I've been working on it daily,"
Smith said. "I've seen dramatic im-
provement, so I feel a lot better and
lot more comfortable now."
It hasn't been easy, though. The
coaches had to re-teach the funda-
mentals to Smith, who needed to sure
up both his fielding and throwing.
"I've been working on it daily.
I've seen dramatic improve-
ment, so I feel a lot better and
lot more comfortable now."
Bryson Smith
UF junior third baseman
"He comes out here on his off days
and works on his own," O'Sullivan
said. "He's taking it as a challenge,
and he has improved an awful lot."
The 6-foot-2 Smith was drafted in
the 30th round of the MLB Draft by
the Cleveland Indians but decided to
transfer to Florida instead of making
the jump to professional baseball for
one huge reason.
"He still has some things to
prove," Robinson said. "I think his
biggest goal is making an appear-
ance in the College World Series,
and that's one of the main reasons he
chose UF."

Stats shown are from South Carolina and Xavier
games
It was hardly a good week for the Gators, as
they lost both games to make their NCAA Tour-
nament chances even more unclear, but Parsons
continues to impress. The 6-foot-9 forward had
his second-straight double-double, scoring 13
points and grabbing 11 boards against South
Carolina, and came just two rebounds short of a
third against Xavier on Saturday (15 points, eight
Chandler Parsons rebounds). In addition to his improved all-around
game, Parsons showed flashes of potential above
the rim, throwing down nasty dunks at South Carolina and taking a crowd-
pleasing alley-oop (layup) from Erving Walker in the O'Connell Center.
Stats: 28 points, 12-24 shooting, 19 rebounds, 7 assistsWalker did his best to keep UF in the
South Carolina game, dropping a team-
high 20 points on 6-of-10 shooting, and
when his shot faltered against Xavier, he
dished out eight assists. The point guard
isn't putting up shooting numbers like he was
earlier in the conference season, but he led
the team with 31 points on the week and at
Erving Walker times seemed to be the team's only depend-
able free-throw shooter. The Gators will
need Walker to perform more consistently to have a shot at making
the Tournament, as his 3-of-l0 shooting Saturday made the team's
offensive weaknesses seem even more glaring.
Stats: 31 points, 9-20 shooting, 10-14 FTs, 11 assists, 5
rebounds

We thought about giving this spot to former
Gator Jonathan Mitchell, whose 24 points and seven
rebounds helped lead Rutgers to an upset of then-No.
8 Georgetown on Sunday -and not just because we
love JMitch. Our voters were divided, but we agreed
on one thing: Nobody aside from Parsons and Walker
put together a particularly impressive week. So, we're
giving the third-place spot to Tyus, whose 11 -point,
Alex Tyus 15-rebound performance at South Carolina gave him
the edge over freshman guard Kenny Boynton. Tyus
was great at times against the Gamecocks, blocking three shots and shooting
5 of 7 from the field, but he barely showed up against Xavier. The junior
power forward scored nine points on 4-of-13 shooting and only grabbed
four rebounds against the Musketeers, and he recorded a team-high seven
turnovers on the week.
Stats: 20 points, 9-20 shooting, 19 rebounds, 4 blocks

M IKE, from page 14
Is it the players? They are
adults. Shouldn't they be capable
of handling themselves?
Is it society's fault for building
them up to feel like they're above
the law?
Is it on the high school teach-
ers, coaches or parents for letting
them slide by?
There are plenty of ways to
look at it, but at a certain point,
the blame game has to take a
backseat to just fixing the prob-lem.
That point is now.
Florida is quickly becom-
ing a national punchline when
it comes to arrests, and without
Tebow around, the Band-Aid
covering up UF's ugly scars has
been peeled away.
The program doesn't have a
face right now, and if the Gators
aren't careful, that face is going
to be a mugshot.
For me, the answer isn't to just
kick these guys off the team. And
Meyer doesn't believe in that ei-ther, unless the crime is particu-
larly heinous.
He learned that lesson a few
years ago with cornerback Avery
Atkins, who was booted out and
later would up dead.
Meyer feels a responsibility to
try to give second chances and
develop players into better peo-
ple.
He always gives the spiel
about how his players are high-
quality humans and how his
coaching staff is all about devel-
oping good people.Well, it's time to do that.
The first thing to say is, "STOP
HITTING WOMEN!" This re-
ally shouldn't be that hard, and it
has become something of a trend
lately.
Also, there have to be some
punishments other than making
them run or kicking them off the
team that could do the trick.
Don't let these players think
they can spend a night in the
pokey, have super-lawyer Hunt-
ley Johnson fix the situation then
get back on the field after someextra conditioning.
From Day 1, they should know
that if they can't behave, they
can't play.
You know how players lose
playing time if they suck and
can't make tackles?
Make it clear that slapping,
choking, shooting, stealing or
fighting will be treated as more
seriously.
Until that's understood, Flor-
ida is going to keep heading to-
ward being known as the new
Thug U.
