Officials find bodies in
plane crash wreckage

Fourbodies were recovered from the wreck-
age of a plane that crashed Sunday evening in
the Everglades after leaving Gainesville.
A crew found two men, a woman and a
young male, according to a Broward Sheriff's
Office release.
Authorities have not released the victims'
names, but friends and family identified them
as Bruce Barber, of Sea Ranch Lakes, Fla.; his
wife, Karen; their 14-year-old son, Payton; and
family friend Phillip Marsh, of Ft. Lauderdale.
The group was in town for the UF football
game against the Tennessee.
Shirley Barber, Bruce's mother, said the

City changes trash rules
By ESTEE BECK
Alligator Contributing Writer
Alachua County's waste management
system is getting a makeover.
Beginning Oct. 1, trash will be picked up
Monday through Thursday instead of Mon-
day through Friday, under a seven-year con-
tract approved by the Board of County Com-
missioners Tuesday.
The $3.1 million contract between Alach-
ua County and Emerald Waste Services will
also introduce a Web site where residents
can submit complaints and service requests.
The changes will not result in a cost in-
crease for residents, according to waste col-
lection program coordinator Mary Ulseth.
"Our motto is 'embrace zero waste,"'
Ulseth said. "We would like to do something
with it other than throw it away and bury it
in the ground."
Pasteboard, which includes cereal boxes
and drink cartons, will be added to the list of
orange bin recyclables, along with junk mail,
"Copyrighted Material
Syndicated Content
Available from Commercial News Providers"paper, margarine and yogurt containers.
Because so many items will be recyclable,
residents can apply for smaller trash bins,
saving up to $200 a year on their GRU bills.
Waste collection manager Milton Towns
said the county recycles about 33 percent of
waste. Florida's goal is to recycle 75 percent
of its waste by 2020, according to a release.
Towns also emphasized that having one
company serve all residences
Local in Alachua County will make
News problems easier to fix. Under
the current contract, different
companies manage the cities' waste.
The new contract also no longer requires
a request for bulk pickup. Regular waste ve-
hicles will pick it up or send in a proper vehi-
cle within 24 hours of regular trash pickup.
Yard trash will only be collected in brown
paper lawn bags or reusable containers, both
available at local stores.
Residents will be notified of changes in
October. All policies will be enforced by
Nov.1.

Sept. 20, 1976: Florida's College of Veterinary
Medicine opens its doors to students at UF.
The college welcomes a modest 40 students into its
classrooms, chosen from a pool of about 400 applicants,
h according to the college's dean, Charles Cornelius.
"We hope to go to 80 next year," Cornelius said.
E "We only took 40 the first year because the buildings
aren't finished, and we'll need time to build our animal
stock up."

SG debates Aramark's
treatment of workers
0 SENATORS CALLED FOR BETTER
PAY FOR FARM WORKERS.
By CAROLYN TILLO
Alligator Writer
Some student senators had a bone to
pick with Aramark, UF's food provider,
Tuesday night.
Progress Party Sen. Dave Schneider and
Unite Party Sen. Megan Vu both presented
resolutions taking stands against the treat-
ment of workers for Aramark's suppliers.
A resolution is a piece of legislation that
expresses the views of the Student Senate
but takes no action.
Schneider, who represents Rawlings
Hall, presented a resolution that encour-
aged Aramark to negotiate a wage increase
for workers who pick the tomatoes Ara-
mark purchases.
Schneider said the farmers have faced
long hours, poor working conditions and
cases of slavery.
Orange and Blue Party Sen. Jonathan
Ossip agreed, adding the bill presented
a human rights issue. He said Aramark's
other practices on campus, including its
promotion of meal plans, needed to be ex-
amined.Unite Party Sen. Jason Cornman said
the resolution should be rewritten so it
didn't imply that all Florida farmers were
treating their workers poorly.
The resolution failed 26 to 22.
"The thing I really came to realize to-
night is that there is a wing of Senate that
is dedicated to burning any kind of bridge
we can have with the rest of Florida and
the national and global community," Sch-
neider said.
Vu, who represents District A, pre-
sented a second reso-
Student lution that encouragedGovernment Aramark to take ac-
tion against its uniform
provider, W&D Apparel, which has been
convicted by the U.S. State Department of
confining and exposing workers to poor
conditions.
Vu said the issue relates to students
because every dollar they spend on food
could be contributing to these "horrible
conditions."
"We have the consumer power here,"
Vu said.
An amendment was added to the reso-
lution to allow it to be sent to other public
universities to encourage them to support
it.
Vu's resolution passed.Hispanic speaker to visit
By ALISON SCHWARTZ
Alligator Writer
Linda Chavez isn't familiar with the
9-to-5 workday.
A Fox News analyst and chairman of
the Center for Equal Opportunity, Chavez
was the highest-ranking woman on for-
mer President Ronald Reagan's staff and
was the first Hispanic woman nominated
to the U.S. Cabinet.
Chavez is scheduled to speak today at
8 p.m. in the Reitz Union Grand Ballroom,
but she's not going to focus on the work
she's done.
"I'm going to speak about the progress
that has been made by Hispanics in the
United States and some of the misconcep-
tions people have of the Hispanic popula-
tion," she said. "A lot of people think of it
as a disadvantage, but they're not aware
of the progress [that has been made]."
In honor of Hispanic Heritage Month,
Chavez is raising awareness of some of
the key issues affecting the Hispanic com-
munity, such as immigration, affirmative
action and education.
"Not enough young Hispanics are go-
ing to college today," Chavez said. "We
need to ask ourselves, 'How can we try to
increase the number of Hispanics going to
college?'"
Higher education is important toChavez, who said she credits her own suc-
cess to doing well in school.
"I grew up poor and worked my way
through college," she said.
Due to her academic success, Chavez
said she was able to move up the econom-
ic ladder and pursue a career in politics.
Although she has worked with many
former presidents and senators, there is
one politician she would still like to meet.
"President Obama is
the first president in a
very long time I haven't
met personally,"
Chavez said. "I'd loveIII to meet him. I'd love tointerview him too"
"We don't necessari-
Chavez ly see eye-to-eye on cer-
tain things," she added.
One of those "things" is the direction
of the economy, and Chavez believes this
hot-button issue should be of major con-
cern to students and soon-to-be gradu-
ates.
"I think the class of 2010 should be
worried," Chavez said. "I think this is the
first time in history students may face a fu-
ture with less economic opportunity than
their parents."'
Tonight's event is coordinated by Ac-
cent and the Hispanic Student Associa-
tion.

Family flew to Gators home games since the mid-'90s
PLAN E, from page 1
ange-and-blue-striped plane to fly to games.
The family stayed at the Magnolia Planta-
tion Bed and Breakfast Inn for every home
game since the mid-1990s, according to inn
owner Joe Montalto. He knew the Barbers be-
fore their children were born and considered
them extended family, he said.
"The kids grew up here. It was kind of like
a family reunion every fall," Montalto said.
"We grew very attached to them."
He added that he is concerned for Chloe.
"She has some of the best characteristics of
the whole family," he said. "She is alive for a
reason."
Montalto said he never met a bigger Gatorsfan than Bruce Barber. After each game, they
would have a "debriefing session," discuss-
ing the game for three or four hours.
Smith met Marsh through a mutual friend
during their undergraduate years at UF. He
said Marsh asked to fly with the Barbers so
he would not have to make theState drive alone.
News "Gregarious does not even
begin to describe [him]," Smith
said. "He was the most outgoing, entertain-
ing, bright person I knew."
Though he didn't have any kids of his
own, Marsh was devoted to his family, es-
pecially his many siblings and their children,
Smith said. Marsh was also a proud Gator.
"Name the game, and he went to it,"Smith said.
The plane crashed before 6 p.m. Sunday
west of U.S. 27 near the Broward-Palm Beach
county line, according to the release.
Federal Aviation Administration spokes-
woman Kathleen Bergen said the plane was
registered to Bull Gator Air Inc., which Bruce
Barber owned.
Neither the FAA nor the National Trans-
portation Safety Board would comment on
the crash's cause. An NTSB spokesman said
investigators will be on the scene Wednesday,
and a report should be released next week.
"They are going to be missed by everyone
involved with them," Montalto said. "[They]
need to be remembered not just as Gator fans
but also as a special family."s ss

Flavor Flav
Menthol cigarettes in
same category as cloves
If the Food and Drug Administration wanted to prevent
people from picking up smoking, menthol cigarettes would
be included in the ban on flavored tobacco.
On Tuesday, the sale of cigarettes flavored with anything
other than menthol became illegal.
According to The New York Times, mentholated cigarettes
are exempt partly because they are viewed as politically off-
limits. Without lobbyists from companies such as Philip Mor-
ris USA, the legislation to allow FDA regulatory power over
the tobacco industry might not have ever passed.
President Obama gave power to the FDA to control the to-
bacco industry in June, and this ban is the first visible sign of
their new regulatory power.
The rationale for banning flavored cigarettes was that since
they are less harsh tasting than full-flavored cigarettes, neo-
phyte smokers would be more likely to pick them up.
However, one study from the Harvard School of Public
Health concluded that cigarette companies have deliberately
controlled the amount of menthol in their cigarettes to provide
a milder experience for first-time smokers.
Another study by the Massachusetts Tobacco Control Pro-
gram describes menthol cigarettes as having a "mint-like flavor
that lessens the impact of tobacco's perceived harsh taste."
Sounds like menthol cigarettes are flavored and marketed
toward new smokers.
If the FDA was serious about preventing people from
smoking, it would not make itself beholden to tobacco lob-
byists worried about revenue losses and count menthol ciga-
rettes as flavored.
Pigskin Problem
T ie UF studentswith flu-like symp-
toms are being
encouraged to quarantine
themselves in their homes,
three Gators with the flu took
the field on Saturday.
We think it's pretty sweet
that we managed to beat Ten-
nessee with the flu affecting
our players, but we also ques-
tion whether the decision to
let the players onto the grid-
iron was a responsible one.
The players are being iso-
lated during the week to pre-
vent further outbreak, but on
weekends they are allowed to
compete in Florida weather
in full-blown body armor.
Considering one of the
players had a 101-degree
temperature, that doesn't ex-
actly sound like the road to
recovery.
When we get the flu, we're
so dazed that we can barely
follow the plot of a Sarah Jes-
sica Parker movie on TBS,
nevermind run 7-yard touch-downs, catch passes or make
tackles like Jeff Demps, Aar-
on Hernandez and Jermaine
Cunningham did on Satur-
day.
We understand the pres-
sure the players must have
felt to compete in Saturday's
game, and we understand
that it was ultimately up to
the team's doctors whether
or not they were capable of
playing.
We just think the risk to
both the infected UF players
and Tennessee's team was
unnecessary.
A New England Journal
of Medicine article from 2000
describes a case in which a
Norwalk-like virus was trans-
mitted from Duke's team to
Florida State's team, so it's
possible to pass the swine flu
through a contact sport.
Tennessee might have vol-
unteered for a beatdown, but
we're sure they wouldn't vol-
unteer to bring an epidemic
back to their school.

s oversight 3LS
As a student at UF, I am distressed to see
that Aramark, the company contracted to pro-
vide food services, has seen fit to raise the prices
charged by franchises in the Reitz Union and
elsewhere on campus above those charged at
off-campus franchise locations, especially while
students are increasingly feeling financially
crunched. Where is the oversight?
I'm sure I'm not alone in thinking the stu-
dents should have a say in whether they ought
to be price-gouged as a result of university con-
tracts.
Upon further research, I found that students
aren't the only ones who are losing out because
of Aramark. The Coalition of Immokalee Work-
ers, an organization of agricultural workers
based in southwest Florida, has sought a penny-
per-pound pay increase for the tomato pickers
who supply Aramark. That the company has so
far failed to make any response is unsurprising,
given their attitude toward students.
Aramark is not working for the students,
and it is not working for Florida workers.

Newspapers not worth the cost
Let me let the hardcore political party mem-
bers in on a little secret: The average student
does not care about The New York Times.
In three years on campus I have seen one
person with a New York Times. Never have I
been able to grab a New York Times or sat next
to someone in class with a New York Times.
Three hundred papers handed out in a college
of 50,000 students do not even make a dent in
the student population.
For something that people can get by look-
ing on the Internet, it is a colossal waste of
money. Spending $60,000 on 300 newspapers?
You do realize that $60,000 is almost equal to
the entire budget for all the clubs in the College
of Engineering? The self-congratulation and fin-
ger pointing I've seen in the Alligator over this
issue has been disgraceful.

Guest column
UF Libertarians left out
of health care forum
f any of you went to the Health
Care Forum on Monday night
hosted by Student Government's
Chomp the Vote, you would have
noticed that the student organiza-
tions participating in the discussion
included only the College Democrats
and the College Republicans.
I assumed there would be more
groups present, as promised by
Chomp the Vote. As the vice presi-
dent of Students for the Preservation
of Freedom (also known informally
as the College Libertarians or SPF), I
am deeply saddened by the complete
lack of effort the host of this debate
put forth to include other political stu-
dent organizations in this important
discussion. I feel that the nonpartisan
Chomp the Vote would welcome a
variety of opinions in the debates it
hosts, but apparently Iam mistaken. I
don't know what they were thinking,
but last time I checked, describing
an event as having "various student
organizations" participating does not
constitute including only Republi-
cans and Democrats.
I shouldn't be surprised, though.
Much like our current two-party
political system, my organization,
having differing views with both the
Democrats and Republicans, has his-
torically been excluded from political
debates on UF's campus. You would
think the message of smaller govern-
ment and increased personal liberties
would resonate with students here
at UF, and it does. But the political
establishment tries its hardest to sup-
press any reasonable debate that is
outside the "mainstream." In such
an important issue as health-care re-
form, it would be careless to ignore
the concerns of any legitimate opin-
ion and just assume the Republicans
and Democrats have all aspects of the
debate covered. I find it detrimental,
especially on a university campus, to
restrict the views of any organization
or person even though I may dis-
agree with their positions. This is tru-
ly an issue of freedom of speech, andDaniel Rood Chomp the
Speaking Out Vote should
feel ashamed
for its actions.
To give youbetter context onwhat
exactly happened, the College Re-
publicans and the College Democrats
decided privately that they would
have a forum on health care and then
asked SG's Chomp the Vote to host
the event. At this point, what Chomp
the Vote should have done was to
go ahead and invite other political
student organizations to participate
in the forum as is required by UF's
Non-Discrimination Policy.
SPF only received notice of the
debate through the grapevine three
days before the forum took place. My
organization immediately sent formal
requests to the College Democrats
and the College Republicans asking
to be included in the discussion, but
we have yet to receive responses. We
then contacted Chomp the Vote and
asked that our group be allowed to
participate, but they denied our par-
ticipation explaining to us that the
debate was "set in stone."
We attended the forum from the
audience and were given the oppor-
tunity to submit written questions.
The funny thing was, when our ques-
tions were finally read by Chomp the
Vote, they edited most of the content
out, totally distorting the context of
the questions.
I don't know if this is standard
practice, but I don't think it's appro-
priate for an organization that prides
itself on hosting fair political discus-
sions to manipulate reasonable ques-
tions from the audience in order to
dilute the intensity of the debate.
Hopefully in the future, SPF and
other student organizations are giv-
en the opportunity to participate in
discussions on important issues like
health care, but I'm not holding my
breath.
Daniel Rood is the vice president
of Studentsfor the Preservation of
Freedom.

Murphy's versatility key for UF
By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
aberry@aligator org
Kelly Murphy's versatility has her
coach dreaming of a rule change or
two.
Not because Murphy has beenbreak-
ing rules for Mary Wise and No. 5 Flor-
ida (8-1, 2-0 Southeastern Conference),
but rather because the sophomore's skill
set allows her to do practically anything 0
Wise needs her to on the court.
"In a perfect world, we'd change the
rules to where she could pass, set and
hit to herself -that she could contact
the ball twice in a row -because her
skills are so unique and she has that tal-
ent," Wise said.
"In a perfect world, we'd
change the rules to where she
could pass, set and hit to her-
self -that she could contact
the ball twice in a row -be-
cause her skills are so unique
and she has that talent."
Mary Wise
UF volleyball coach
Murphy's ability to perform a num-
ber of jobs for the Gators is even reflect-
ed by the slash in her listed position of
setter/right-side hitter -she can't be
confined to just one role.
With the SEC season now under-
way, Murphy is nearing midseason
form in much the same way she did last
year, when she was named the National
Freshman of the Year.
On Friday, Murphy notched her sec-
ond triple-double of the season at Ole
Miss, putting up 20 kills, 32 assists and
16 digs. She nearly added another one
Sunday, finishing with eight kills, 17 as-
sists and nine digs against Arkansas.
After recording her first triple-dou-
ble of the 2009 season against Stanford
on Sept. 4, Murphy is already ahead of
the pace she set in 2008. As a freshman,
she tallied a Florida-record six, all of
which came after the Gators' conference
schedule began.
"I don't know what the NCAA re-
cord is for [triple-doubles], but I think, 76
Harrison Diamond / Alligator Staff
UF sophomore Kelly Murphy tallied her second triple-double of the season
Friday against Ole Miss. She now has eight in her 40-match career.
Kelly's going to make a run because of
all of her skills," Wise said. "I think that
her best volleyball will always be the
middle of the season to the end of the
season, when she's gotten enough reps
in practice playing with the players she
plays next to."
Sophomores Colleen Ward and
Kristy Jaeckel are among those benefit-
ing the most from Murphy's versatil-
ity. The two outside hitters are first and
second on the team in kills, respectively,
with Murphy currently in third.While Murphy's utility has allowed
her teammates to fill up the stat sheet,
junior setter Brynja Rodgers has freed
up Murphy to use her talent as a hitter.
The two have had to build chemistry
on the fly given Rodgers' late arrival to
Gainesville, but their time on the court
together is already paying dividends.
"There is no pause button that we
can just pause the season, let them play
together in practice," Wise said. "We
just had to keep going, and we knew it
was just a matter of time."

info@morriscenters.comSix more out
with flu-like
symptoms
By MIKE McCALL
A Iligator Staff Writer
mmcca Il@aligator org
Six more Florida players were held out of prac-
tice Tuesday because of flu-like symptoms, coach
Urban Meyer said.
Starting linebacker A.J. Jones, safety Josh Evans,
receiver Justin Williams, running back Mike Gil-
lislee, defensive lineman Earl Okine and offensive
lineman Shawn Schmieder are the latest to be limit-
ed by illness. He added that defensive end Jermaine
Cunningham and running back Jeff Demps -both
starters -still haven't fully recovered.
"We're battling a little bit," Meyer said. "We'll
just control what we can control. Guys are wiping
down everything, we're doing everything we can,
and I think we'll be OK."
When asked about the prospect
of Tim Tebow taking ill, Meyer
joked, "He's coming with me to that
Football deserted island I talked about."
THE E ND?: Meyer may have
finally ended the back and forth between he and
Tennessee coach Lane Kiffin. When a reporter
started to ask him about Kiffin's remark on Mon-
day that suggested the Gators used the flu as an
excuse for their performance Saturday, Meyer
cut the question short with a "no comment."
WHATEVER IT TAKES: Offensive coordinator Steve
Addazio said he isn't concerned with Tebow
carrying the ball 24 times against Tennessee and
doesn't necessarily see a reason to gameplan dif-
ferently with Kentucky coming up this weekend.
"We do what we got to do, period," Addazio
said. "I think we're going to do whatever it takes
to win the game, like we did, like we will do this
week. Nothing is ever going to change there. It's all
about one thing -get a W."
Addazio agreed there were probably only six or
so plays designed for Tebow to carry the ball with
no option of handing it off or throwing it to a re-
ceiver.

Sturgis surprised to earn kicking duties against UT
0 HE MADE ALL THREE
FIELD GOALS SATURDAY.
By BOBBY CALLOVI
Alligator Staff Writer
bcallovi@alligator org
It wasn't that Caleb Sturgis
didn't think he was good enough
to win the starting kicker job
from Jonathan Phillips.
He just didn't really believe
there was a race to be won.
With the year Phillips had
in 2008, there was no reason to
think Sturgis would have much
of a shot. Phillips finished the
year 78 for 79 on extra-point
tries, setting a new school and
Southeastern Conference re-
cord, and was 12 of 13 on his
field-goal attempts.
But Sturgis continued to
work to improve his kicking
with the idea that he would be
ready for the 2010 season when
Phillips would have used up his
eligibility.
Until then, he would just
have to be content with his
role of handling kickoff duties,
which he also did last season as
a freshman.
"I wanted to believe I could(win the job), but at the same
time, after the season he had last
year -all last season he kicked
really good -I just focused on
my own and getting better," St-
urgis said.
But through the first two
games of the season, Phillips
had already missed an extra
point and a field goal -match-
ing his misses from all of 2008.
Coach Urban Meyer said af-
ter the Troy game he would be
opening up the kicking battle.
Sturgis continued to outper-
form Phillips, something he had
been doing since the beginning
of fall practice.
"Caleb actually outkicked
him slightly during training
camp, but Jon earned the right
to play," Meyer said. "Tuesday,
Wednesday and Thursday we
will chart all their kicks -we
have done it before here -and
the best kickers goes and kicks."
Even after having a better
week in practice than Phillips,
Sturgis was unaware before the
Tennesse game that he would be
taking the field goals and extra
points as well as kickoffs.
Meyer told him to warm up
before the third down just prior

UF kicker Caleb Sturgis lines up for the first field-goal attempt of his career during the Gators' 23-13 win
against Tennessee in Ben Hill Griffin Stadium on Saturday. Sturgis was 3 for 3 with a long of 37 yards.
Don't worry, Florida will fix flaws
Tere is no need for Gators fans to
Sure, UF did not look its domi-
nant self against Tennessee.
And the 23-13 score was not the mas-
sacre everyone expected against a Volun-
teers team that was supposed to be down
this year.
Florida's offense never seemed to be
in rhythm with quarterback Tim Tebow
running more than he should need to and
the wide receivers barely being anything
more than some extra blockers.
Then, there was the defense that had
a poor tackling performance and allowed
Montario Hardesty to have a good day
running the ball for Tennessee.
Yet the Gators still walked away with
a win despite not playing their best, and
that says a lot about this team.
Tennessee came in with a great game
plan on defense to slow down Florida's of-
fense, and it worked extremely well.
But Urban Meyer and Tebow deserve
some credit for realizing they would have
to play a slower style than they woulda

bcallovi@alligato r orglike.
The Gators'
spread is usually a
high-scoring, fast-
paced offense and
can have problems
when the deep ball
is taken away, but
their running game
is better than it has
been in previous
years.
That showed Saturday when UF chose
to run the ball 44 times for 208 yards.
The Volunteers didn't allow any big
gains, but they did little to stop the Gators
from running time after time.
UT wanted to establish the run and
control the clock, and it did that. But UF
did it better.
When the Gators came out after half-
time, there was a clear decision to commit
to this style of play and in the third quar-
ter, they had the ball for 11 minutes and
11 seconds.
SEE BOBBY, PAGE 16UF emphasizes set pieces
By EUGENIO TORRENS
Alligator Writer
etorrens@alligator org
The term "special teams" isn't only ap-
plicable to football.
UF soccer has its own version of special
teams -it's how the Gators refer to set
pieces.
Set pieces are situations where the ball
is being put back in play and usually refers
to corner kicks and free kicks. Throw-ins
are also technically set pieces.
When these situations arrive, they indi-
cate a scoring opportunity; something UF
has had a bit of trouble with lately.
While Florida has scored 10 goals in its
last four games, the team has had a tough-
er time scoring on set pieces.
The Gators know how it feels to be onthe wrong side of set pieces and are us-
ing that for motivation. UF lost to FSU on
Friday 1-0 in overtime off a set-piece goal
that started with a throw in and ended on
a goal off a deflection.
"We are a team that has been scored on
with set pieces enough to know how much
that can change a game,"
senior Angela Napolitano
said.
Victor Campbell, theSoccer Gators associate head coach,
works with the team on free
kicks and services for corner kicks. He
tries to stress how valuable set pieces are,
including all the techniques that go into an
effective set piece.
"It's all about technique," Campbell

said. "It's nothing to do with who wants it
more or who wants it less.
"It'salmostlike kicking a field goal,you're
very deliberate," Campbell said about the
technique. "You set the ball down exactly so
you hit that same spot every time."
Mis-aiming by even a quarter of an inch
or hitting the ball a fraction off-speed could
be the difference between a goal and a save.
Lauren Hyde scored a goal on Aug. 30,
against USF on a 25-yard free kick that hit off
the goal post and ricocheted in. Faced with a
similar situation on Sunday against Eastern
Kentucky, Hyde didn't hit the ball with the
right pace, and it went right into the hands
of the keeper.
Campbell said the real key is having the
technique down pat so in pressure situations
the player can focus on just hitting the ball.
"Vic has helped a lot with teaching us
the way you hit the ball, where you hit it onyour foot, the place of the ball that you hit
it," Napolitano said. "Those types of things
all factor into how it spins, where it's going
to land."
Any set piece starts and ends with the
service, so knowing where the ball is going
is crucial to developing an
offensive opportunity.
Without the right de-
livery, it doesn't matter
who is in the box near the
goal because that player
may never touch the ball.E "It's hard to perfect
Hyde something that has to
be so precise every time," Tricia Townsend
said.
One of the maincorner kickers, Townsend
knows a potential set piece goal can be
squandered on the delivery and that may
mean not even attempting a shot on goal.
"It's frustrating even for the people in-
volved in the play because they all want the

In the future, they cannot have Tebow
run the ball 24 times and will need to
establish a go-to receiver. That receiver
doesn't even have to be someone to ex-
tend the field, but someone that will pick
up yards consistently and Tebow will be
able to trust when he is under pressure.
As for the defense, the players just
can't miss tackles. For as bad of a game
as it supposedly had, the unit was still
pretty good.
Hardesty was able to have a solid
performance rushing with 20 carries for
96 yards, but the rest of the team com-
bined for 21 yards on the ground. And
quarterback Jonathan Crompton didn't
even eclipse the century mark in passing
yardage.
Hardesty was the only positive noteextra point in the next (deck)," Meyer said.
"He's got a hose."
Although Sturgis'strong showing seem-
ingly proved the coaches made the right
choice, Meyer said the kicking battle will
be open again this week.
Sturgis will need to continue to outkick
Phillips in practice if he is to lock down the
starting job.
for the Volunteers on offense.
Despite the hype around the UF de-
fense, it was unreasonable to assume
no opponent would ever have a good
game. One player having a big game is
not enough to break this defense.
Last year, the unit allowed three run-
ning backs to rush for more than 100
yards. Oklahoma's Chris Brown ran for
110 yards, Alabama's Glen Coffee ran
for 112 yards and Arkansas' Michael
Smith finished with 133, but Florida still
won those games.
The defense also showed last year in
the Alabama game and in the BCS Na-
tional Championship Game that it can
carry the team to victory when the of-
fense has an off day.
And that's all Saturday was for the
Gators -just an off day -so The Gator
Nation can relax for now because this
team still is the best in the country.
