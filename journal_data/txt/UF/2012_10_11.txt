Joy Steiner knew she needed to 
help put a stop to bullying when 
her teenage son was threatened through Facebook by his peers.
Steiner, 34, said she eventually 
had to get police involved because the abuse was so bad.
“It’s a real issue,” she said. 
“There’s nothing more important than how we treat each other.”
Steiner was one of about 300 
people who attended an anti-bul-lying rally on Bo Diddley Com-munity Plaza Wednesday. A march along University Avenue to the plaza preceded the rally.
The Unity Day Rally, which was 
coordinated by the River Phoenix Center for Peacebuilding, focused on ﬁ  nding practical ways to stop bullying and unite the community.
Mayor Craig Lowe, Alachua 
County Sheriff Sadie Darnell and Alachua County School Board member Eileen Roy were among the featured speakers.
Lowe said it’s unfortunate that 
students are bullied about race and sexual orientation.
“Bullying is cruel, harmful and 
detracts from the wealth of human resources in Gainesville,” he said in an interview. “We, in Gainesville, value every human being. We want to afﬁ  rm that today.”
Newberry High School fresh-
man Brandi Gallo, 14, said teenag-ers can take steps to stop bullying in schools.
“If you see something happen-
ing, don’t just ignore it,” she said.
Event organizer Heart Phoe-
nix said she was proud to see Gainesville residents come together for this cause.
“They’re standing up instead of 
standing by,” she said.
Phoenix, who is also the board president of River Phoenix Center for Peacebuilding, said both bullies and victims suffer when the issue is ignored.
“Bullying is a learned behavior, 
and it can be unlearned,” she said.

When Jason Alexander 
was greeted by applause 
at UF Hillel on Wednesday afternoon, he wasn’t sure if the crowd was clapping for him or his full head of hair.
His hairpiece may have 
been fake, but Alexander’s message was sincere; stu-dents should vote in the upcoming presidential election.
“I’m not proud of it, but 
I didn’t vote in most elec-tions,” he said to a crowd of about 70 people who gathered to hear him speak at the Gators for Obama event.
“I didn’t think anyone 
would get elected and change things,” he added later.
Alexander told the au-
dience that putting money in education and cutting costs to middle-class work-ers would stimulate the economy. He also warned attendees to be wary of Mitt Romney’s austerity and trickle-down econom-ics advocacies.
“He’s made a proﬁ  t for 
investors, not workers,” Alexander said. “Nothing Mitt Romney has ever built or destroyed has helped that guy.”
He also spoke about 
protecting reproductive rights, improving Pales-tinian-Israeli relations and nominating Supreme Court justices.
“I truly believe what 
happens in this election will set the course for the next 20 years,” he said. “That’s most of your and my sons’ adult lives.”
He wasn’t the ﬁ  rst celeb-
rity to endorse Obama at UF. Actor Justin Long spoke at a Gators for Obama event in August.
“Engage, understand, 
advocate,” said Alexan-der, who spoke at Florida State University earlier that day. “You may have to get your hands dirty sooner, but there could be great re-wards.”

UF students of all faiths will fast from 
sunrise to sunset today as part of Islam on 
Campus’ 10th annual Fast-a-Thon. The day will conclude with an event at 7 p.m. at the Stephen C. O’Connell Center, and attendees do not have to fast.
“We just want to share the experience 
with them with hopes of expanding under-standing and awareness of Islamic religion and this aspect of our religion, which is very beloved, ” said the organization’s president, Abidah Ali, a 21-year-old political science senior.
Muslims fast from sunrise to sunset ev-
ery day during the holy month of Ramadan. The event is also a fundraiser for groups that help the hungry and homeless.
Ali said about 900 people attended last 
year, and the organization raised about $5,000. This year, Islam on Campus hopes to top that.The money collected will be split evenly 
between Project Downtown, a Gainesville nonproﬁ  t that feeds the less fortunate, and Islamic Relief, which aids in the Syrian hu-manitarian relief.
“In Islam, there is this obligation to ﬁ  rst take care of the community you live in, and then if you can fulﬁ  ll that obligation, you can help aid those who aren’t in your com-munity,” Ali said.
The treasurer of Islam on Campus, Hun-
aid Ismail, said he expects the event to run the way it usually does: Once the sun sets, everyone heads for the food.
“If you fast, or even if you don’t fast, you 
understand how grateful you should be,” Ismail, a 20-year-old accounting junior said. “You actually have food in front of you.”

Drinking in Gainesville may 
feel a little less scientiﬁ  c by the 
end of the month.
The Laboratory bar and res-
taurant will close its doors for the last time Oct. 31.
Larry Bruce, owner of The 
Laboratory, said new owners bought the building that houses his bar and raised his rent by about a third.
“This sprung up on us fast,” 
Bruce said.
Bruce, a UF anthropology 
alumnus, said he opened The Laboratory three years ago as an alternative to Gainesville’s other nightlife options.
“In Gainesville, it’s either Midtown or Downtown,” he said. “If you don’t feel uber-trendy or comfortable in either place, you could always come here.”
The bar won’t relocate because 
of a slow summer season, Bruce said. He hopes to get another job and save money to reopen the bar.
Sarah Nelson, a Santa Fe Col-
lege psychology sophomore, said she likes to watch shows at the bar and appreciates the atmo-sphere.
“They are a little gimmicky 
where they serve beer in bea-ker glasses, which is cute,” the 25-year-old said.
One of Bruce’s favorite aspects 
of the bar is how it brings together different social groups in a place where they can meet.
“We wanted to create a place 
for everyone,” he said. “And I think we did a good job.”

� FORMER GATORS AND NFL PLAY-
ERS WILL SIGN AUTOGRAPHS DUR-ING THE GRAND OPENING.
CHRIS KIRSCHNER
Alligator Contributing Writer
When former Gators football player 
Crawford Ker decided to open a res-
taurant, he focused on a tailgating fa-vorite: wings.
Ker’s WingHouse Bar & Grill, 3857 
SW Archer Road, will celebrate its grand opening today from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. The restaurant, which has loca-tions in Florida and Texas, features wings and entrees big enough to ﬁ  ll a hungry Gator.
Chris Osman, regional manager, said 
Ker was excited to open the Gainesville branch because of his attachment to UF. Ker was a Gators football offensive lineman from 1983 to 1984.
Former Gators and NFL players will 
sign autographs at the grand opening, including Doug Johnson, Scot Brantley and Chris Doering.
“For Gator fans looking to inter-
act with former Gator greats and eat some wings, this event will be great for them,” Osman said.
The prices for a ﬁ  ve-piece plate of 
wings is $4.99, and a 50-piece plate costs $37.99. Burgers and sandwiches range from $6.99 to $9.99.
The restaurant features a honey-
based sauce ranging from mild to “exx-treme.” Osman said the portions aren’t for the meek, either; a 50-wing plate is about 10 pounds of chicken.
“If you go to other wing houses, you 
may get a pigeon-sized wing. But at our restaurant, you receive huge wings that will ensure you are full,” he said.

fered to speak at UF for free.
“They know the youth vote is impor-
tant,” she said, “and it’s important to get them excited for President Obama.”
McGovern said she supported Presi-
dent Obama because of his policy to keep student loan interest rates low. She and her twin sister took out loans to pay for classes.
“I know that I can’t ask my parents to 
borrow money for college,” McGovern said.
Jon Beever, a 19-year-old economics freshman, said he wasn’t surprised Alex-ander took time to speak to students.
After his speech, Alexander took pic-
tures with fans for about five minutes.
“They come across as apathetic come-
dians, but they’re really passionate about voting,” Beever said, referencing Alexan-der and Jerry Seinfeld. “If there’s a couple things they care about, it’s who runs the world.”

� ONE IN FIVE AMERICANS 
WOULDN’T VOTE FOR A MORMON. 
BROCK SENG
Alligator Contributing Writer
In a country founded on religious 
freedom, a Gallup poll showed that one 
in five Americans wouldn’t vote for a qualified candidate because he or she is a Mormon.
Mitt Romney, a Mormon, will chal-
lenge the incumbent president, Barack Obama, a Christian, Nov. 6.
Students stand on both sides of the 
argument of whether religion matters when it comes to the presidency.
John Michael Yakulevich, a 20-year-
old industrial and systems engineer -
ing junior, and Evan M. Eisenberg, a 24-year-old sociology and political sci-ence junior, both said if the candidate had all the necessary qualifications, he or she would have their votes, regard-less of religion.
They have opposing views when it 
comes to religion’s part in politics.
Yakulevich said religion matters be-
cause note should be taken of every-thing about a candidate.
“Religion, for example, reveals some 
of the candidate’s moral values and why he stands where he does on certain issues,” he said.
Eisenberg disagrees.“When it comes to voting for presi-
dent, their religious beliefs are about as important to me as their shoe size,” he said.
Eisenberg said since the United States doesn’t have one view, or one religion, he doesn’t mind people who view gay marriage or abortion as wrong.
However, Yakulevich and Eisenberg 
agree that religion doesn’t make the president good.
“It’s ridiculous,” Yakulevich said. 
“Where would this country be if we held those same standards for all job positions?”
This isn’t the only time religion has 
played a part in politics.
When John F. Kennedy ran for presi-
dent, his religious views became an is-
sue, mainly because he 
was Roman Catholic.
Although Ken-
nedy was a different Christian denomina-tion from most, Laura Sjoberg, associate pro-fessor of political sci-ence, said this election is different.
“Catholicism was something that was 
well-known, and people weren’t sure if they liked it,” she said.
When it came to religion and politics, 
Sjoberg agreed with Eisenberg in the be-lief that religion should not be a part of politics.
“To me, the less religion there is in 
politics, the better,” she said.
She said that in theory, the U.S. is a 
secular country, but in practice, it’s a nonsecular nation, and its influences are seen abroad.
“I think it’s about time we focus on 
the real issues that are haunting Ameri-ca,” Eisenberg said.Poll finds some Americans

Heat is ﬂ  eeting; let’s hear it for Higgs
July 4, 2012 may well be a day that will be remembered 
as one of the great turning points in history. Yet for so many of us, this day went by without fanfare.
On this day, the scientists of the CERN laboratory in Ge-
neva announced their discovery of the Higgs boson. 
To many , this means nothing. What is a Higgs boson, 
and why should I care?
I suspect that future generations will ﬁ  nd it difﬁ  cult to 
understate the signiﬁ  cance of this discovery.
In the words of Bill Nye, “It may mean we’d be able to 
unlock limitless energy.” Such wide applications won’t be feasible for a long time, but they will, in time, exist.
On June 21, just a few days before that great announce-
ment was made, the Miami Heat faced off against the Okla-homa City Thunder in the National Basketball Association Finals. 
The Heat walked away as the national champions, and 
there was hardly a person in Miami that night who didn’t know what happened. The streets were alive with the sounds of people cheering and banging pots and pans to-gether. The cacophony was surely a sign of the euphoria shared by so many.
What I want to know is where those crowds were on the 
night of the Higgs boson announcement.
This is why I am unhappy that so many of us took no 
note of the discovery. Human history will utterly change be-cause of it, but very few have cared.
The discovery of the Higgs boson is the culmination of 
years of scientiﬁ  c pursuit by people all over the globe for generations. The discoveries these scientists make will echo through the ages.
Some thinkers believe humans will one day inhabit every 
corner of the cosmos. When we possess such power, what are the odds that the names Lebron James or Dwyane Wade will mean anything?
I don’t wish to cheapen the place that basketball holds in 
the hearts of many. I just want to illustrate this rather dispro-portionate allocation of public attention. There is probably a big place for sports in a healthy human culture.
However, I ﬁ  nd it troubling 
when such entertainment be-comes the only thing that people are concerned with. The feats achieved by even the best team of basketball players are trivial when compared to the discovery of profound truths governing the universe.
If the Heat kept the streets in Miami alive for a night, then 
CERN should have kept every city on the planet alive for at least a week.
For too many of us, science is nothing more than a factory 
that gives us fancy new gadgets every few years.
The iPhone 5 release is arguably comparable to the vic-
tory of the Heat. Droves of people ﬂ  ocked to stores to get Apple’s shiny new phone. Some had been camping for days. I wonder how much nicer those iPhones would be if we showed such passion for science.
There are more direct threats to scientiﬁ  c understanding.Paul Broun, a member of the House Committee on Sci-
ence, Space and Technology , said, “I don’t believe that the Earth is but about 9,000 years old.” Broun is someone who shares jurisdiction over all of our federal scientiﬁ  c programs. The fact that anyone who believes in such demonstrably false nonsense can even be elected to ofﬁ  ce should be great cause for worry.
I think it would behoove us greatly to reassess what we 
value as a culture and how much we value it. With such dire questions of human survival now facing us, our fate hangs in the balance.
Will we heed the words of scientists who warn of our 
self-annihilating behaviors, or will we scoff and never live to see that day when we sail cosmic seas?
Brandon Lee Gagne is an anthropology senior at UF . His 
column appears on Thursdays.Afﬁ  rmative Action 
Keep it simple, stupid
It seems like there are always at least a dozen things to be 
angry about.
If it’s not gas prices, it’s food quality. If it’s not the envi-
ronment, it’s whatever war we’re involved with.
Today, it’s racial equality.The University of Texas at Austin is back in the news; a stu-
dent’s case against the school went before the Supreme Court.
UT Austin uses afﬁ  rmative action in its admissions process. 
They want to achieve a certain level of student diversity . That’s understandable for the school, as the “only other time that a case involving UT Austin came before the U.S. Supreme Court was in 1950, when the University was sued by Heman Sweatt, a black man who was denied admission to the School of Law because of his race,” according to a Hufﬁ  ngton Post article.
Recently, “Abigail Fisher, a 22-year-old Texan, claims she was 
denied admission to the school’s ﬂ  agship campus in Austin be-cause she was white,” according to USA Today.
This can almost feel like two completely different sides of the 
race issue, but in reality, these two cases are ﬁ  ghting for the same thing: equality.
Nobody should be discriminated against based on race, gen-
der or sexuality. Or what school you attend. Or what clothes you wear. It happens all the time, but it shouldn’t.
Maybe UT Austin should use this opportunity to take a closer 
look at its admitted students.
Police at the university are “investigating reports that four 
students have been assaulted with bleach-ﬁ  lled balloons while walking near campus” last week, according to the Los Angeles Times.
There have been “protests against racially themed frater-
nity parties and on-campus events on Cinco de Mayo during which fraternity members dressed like Border Patrol agents ran around the campus capturing other fraternity members wearing sarapes, sombreros, and T-shirts that read, ‘Illegal alien,’” wrote Gabriel Daniel Solis, author of the Hufﬁ  ngton Post article and UT Austin alumnus.
It’s a problem. And you’re kidding yourself if you think it’s 
just at that university.
Is it naive to wish we could all just get along sometimes? Afﬁ  rmative action feels like a double-edged sword. Is it nec-
essary? In some places, we’d argue it is. Should it be enforced everywhere? Hopefully not.
Why aren’t we at the point, as a country, at which we look 
beyond race? If we’re going to be judged, it should be on our merit, not by our skin color.
At places like UT Austin, maybe admissions should use an 
afﬁ  rmative action-esque program — one that tests students on how racist they are before admitting them.
Stupid is as stupid does. So says Forrest Gump, and so say 
we.
We’re still dealing with a generation raised by scared conser-
vatives who think every state is a border state — not OK.
If schools have shown an inability to positively represent the 
racial makeup of their surrounding areas, then they should have to adjust for that. 
Diversity is important; discrimination is not.

Charles Martin, a UF chemistry professor and local musician, will be the host of “Chuck Martin’s Genius Boy Music Show” on Thursday.
� THE SHOW WILL FEATURE MUSIC AND 
COMEDY.
MICHELLE PROVENZANO
Avenue Writer
The sound of Ricky Nelson singing and playing 
guitar on “The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet” 
in the ’60s turned on a light bulb in a 10-year-old boy’s head.
The boy, Charles Martin, was learning how to 
strum a guitar. Five decades later, Martin, a well-known Gainesville musician and UF chemistry professor, is finally bringing his ’60s variety show inspiration to life.
Martin collaborated with other local talent to 
create a variety act called “Chuck Martin’s Ge-nius Boy Music Show.” The show begins at 9 p.m. Thursday at The Bull, 18 SW First Ave.
The show features Martin, the host, and his Ge-
nius Boy band. Guest acts include singer Michelle Banfield, musicians Rob McGregor and Tom Mill-er and comedian Jason Hedges.
Martin said he loves the idea of a variety show 
setup, because it is different from the band setting he is used to.
With bands, Martin would have to coordinate 
practice and performance times with other mem-bers. By hosting his own show, he gets to collabo-rate with great performers, while calling all of the shots.
“These musicians that are in the show are the 
cream of the Gainesville crop,” Martin said. “The audience will be blown away by the acts I have set up, especially with the powerhouse voice Michelle [Banfield] has.”
Martin said the show will feature many genres 
of music, including the soul, R&B and Rockabilly styles he enjoys.
Banfield said she’s excited for the audience to 
see a different side of her musical talent. She will perform a five-song set list that will incorporate 
different genres of music.
With McGregor and Miller in 
the group, Gainesville’s strong music scene will be at the show.
McGregor has recorded many 
local bands and just released a solo album that is in a league of its own. Miller is an artist with 
many talents, and attendees will enjoy his deep-rooted passion for music. Hedges will arrive at the show fresh off of a recent stand-up performance with Robin Williams, Martin said.
The variety show Martin has created is the cul-
mination of everything that inspired him musi-cally as a child.
“I’m always doing something new because it’s 
a part of who I am,” Martin said. “I don’t know if anyone has done a show like this before, but I knew I had to put on a show that brought back the nostalgia of the shows I loved watching as a child.”
Martin said he has high expectations for this 
show, which he hopes he’ll get to perform again in the new year.
“This act I would take anywhere, on any stage,” 
Martin said. “I’d defy anybody who says, ‘Oh, I could do better than that,’ because there isn’t any-body better, truthfully.”UF Professor hosts variety show

Jeffrey has given up sex.     
For a gay man who has had 
more than 5,000 partners, this is quite an undertaking. Amid the AIDS crisis of the early ‘90s, Jeffrey is consumed by a perpetual fear of the disease.
Jeffrey is the main character in 
Paul Rudnick’s “Jeffrey,” a play that will be put on by the Florida Players at the Phillips Center for the Performing Arts Squitieri Studio Theatre Friday through Sunday. It is free to the public and will have five showings.  
The romantic comedy will take 
the audience through Jeffrey’s trou-bles as he struggles to give into love and life.
When love finds him in the form 
of Steve, a gay man who is HIV-positive, he is faced with the deci-sion to capture happiness and enjoy life or let his fear swallow him.
“He takes the audience with him 
on this journey. You’re inside his brain, and he’s talking to you, and he’s showing you through his eyes what is happening in the world around him,” said Kenny Frechette, a 21-year-old dance senior who plays the title role, Jeffrey. “It’s con-fetti, glitter, theme shows and cats! It’s a ride.”
Forty-one characters, played by 
the eight cast members, make up Jeffrey’s outrageous world.
“A lot of the characters I play 
take place in Jeffrey’s imagination,” said Lindsay Head, a 20-year-old dance junior who plays eight roles. “Each character has to be a little off-kilter, because they are not com-pletely human.”
Head said she had to do a lot of 
accent work for the play, which is full of “brilliant one-liners.”
Director Sacha Foxx Sorrell, a 22-
year-old theatre and telecommuni-cation senior, said the audience can expect a sex game show, an AIDS rodeo and a gay pride parade.
“I think it has a good message of 
trying to find the humor in every-thing,” she said. “Even when the circumstances are horrible, there’s always something to laugh about.”
Despite the humor, the play 
deals with several poignant issues relating to the disease.
The play stresses the hatred 
for this awful disease that can tear people and relationships apart, but it reminds the audience that people should take advantage of life while they have it, Head said.
“It’s been challenging to under -
stand the beauty between hating AIDS and not hating life,” she said.
Ross Mogerley, a 22-year-old 
dance junior who plays seven roles, said the larger-than-life characters help to bring humor into the seri-ousness of the AIDS crisis.
“It felt really relevant to me as a gay artist, being openly gay and proud of my sexuality, too,” he said.  
Frechette said he hopes people 
don’t write off the show because it uses comedy to tell the serious subject of the AIDS epidemic. At its core, it’s a story about love and remembering to enjoy life.  
“I relate to the idea of being re-
ally young at heart, and really play-ful, and really happy and really trying to enjoy life while you have it,” Frechette said. “Enjoy it while you’re young. Enjoy it while you’re hot.”
Even if students can’t relate to 
the AIDS crisis and the horror of the disease, they can relate to Jeffrey, he said. Just like college students may worry about whether they are tak-ing the right path or choosing the major that is right for them, Jeffrey is also confused.
“That’s Jeffrey. He doesn’t know 
where his life is going, and he doesn’t know what path to take,” Frechette said.
He said he hopes audience mem-
bers take away the importance of not giving up, despite all the hard-ships they may be faced with.
“Don’t deny yourself happiness 
if the opportunity presents itself,” he said. “Life will suck a lot of the time, but, damn it, that’s why you have to go for happiness when it presents itself to you.”

The first time I listened to The 
Wallflowers, I was nine years old. 
The significance of this is that for the first time music really affected me.
Now, this is a ridiculous assertion 
because the song in question is “One Headlight,” which is about loss and resolutions, and at nine years old, the only loss I’d experienced was when my cat, Wendy , was hit by a car and when my iguana, Iggy , died of some mysterious lizard disease. (Though that was really for the best, because kids shouldn’t own giant reptiles.)
But still, the song moved me on a 
deeper, underdeveloped psycholog-ical level. Although I was too young to relate to the music’s themes, I still stole the CD from my parents and listened to it whenever an opportu-nity presented itself.
Fast-forward 15 years to The 
Wallflowers’ latest album, “Glad All Over” (available since Tuesday), which is the band’s first studio re-lease in seven years. For the sole purpose of this review, I made it a point to develop emotionally.
From 9 to 24 years old, here is 
a list of emotional milestones I’ve experienced to justify my qualifica-tions:
-Crashed a car-Started a band-Had a dream smashed (wasn’t a 
good band)
-Fell in love-Lost my virginity-Had my heart smashed (wasn’t 
a good boyfriend)
-Moved away-Bartended for sad old men-Attended a wedding-Attended a funeral-Didn’t own another iguana“Glad All Over” opens with a 
catchy , boogie-woogie riff on the electric organ, giving way to the muddy guitar that compliments Jakob Dylan’s gruffy , sentimental voice.
The song, “Hospital For Sinners,” 
makes you want to weave your car in between traffic as you roar past the exit for work and merge onto the highway to an unknown destina-tion.
For me, the mark of a good album 
is one to which you can drive to the 
extent that you lose track of where you were going. “Glad All Over” is out just in time for the cooler weath-er, as the album reflects a “windows down, nostalgia” kind of quality . I’ve planned my first continental road trip for January , and I already know what I’ll be listening to.
If CDs are too passé for you, or 
you don’t have the space or the time 
for an entire album, swing over to iTunes and grab, “Hospital For Sin-ners,” “Misfits and Lovers,” “Reboot The Mission,” “Love is a Country ,” “Constellation Blues” and “One Set of Wings.”
My next advice is to find a mov-
ing window to stare out of, think about something you’ve lost re-cently and hit play. The music will do the rest.THURSDAY, OCTOBER 11, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 9

Fall is here, Halloween 
is near, and “The Walking 
Dead” is back to put you in a spooky mood.
“The Walking Dead” is a 
universally acclaimed and fan-approved zombie apoca-lypse horror show, based on a comic book series of the same name. The upcoming third season will have 16 episodes split into two equal parts, premiering this fall and spring.
After a shocking season 
finale including the death of two main characters, the show’s executive producers are anxious for a new set-ting, new characters and new deaths.
Last season’s farm has 
been burnt down, and the gang of zombie killers is on the hunt for a new home.
A four-minute online pro-
mo revealed the group will set up camp in an abandoned prison. This is quite a turn of events for cast member Sar -
ah Wayne Callies, who spent four years doing the opposite in “Prison Break.”
Fans of the comics are ex-
cited to see the introduction of Michonne, who saved An-drea from a “walker” during last season’s finale.
Danai Gurira will play 
this mysterious new hooded character who walks two chained zombies around like dogs.
David Morrissey joins the 
cast as The Governor, anoth-er comic book favorite, who will be introduced as this season’s main antagonist.
Milton, played by Dallas 
Roberts, was not seen in the com-ics but will act as The Gover -
nor’s  right-
hand man.
One thing has fans even 
more thrilled than the pros-pect of all these new char -
acters combined: the chance to see if they would survive a zombie apocalypse them-selves. This year, Univer -
sal Studios hosts a haunted house dedicated to the show as part of its 22nd annual Halloween Horror Nights.
If that’s too frightening, 
you can always stick to being scared in the comfort of your own home Sundays at 9 p.m. on AMC.‘The Walking Dead’ is

� THE RESTAURANT USES 
THE VERO WATER BOTTLING SYSTEM.
CAROLINA GARCIA
Avenue Contributing Writer
Colorful chalk powder-painted 
walls and handmade wooden cases 
coddling specialty wine and wheat beer line the cozy and eclectic eat-ery . The decor and live music please the customers, but The Jones Bside’s newest initiative has gotten mixed reviews.
The Jones Bside implemented 
a new water service that charges patrons 50 cents for water from the trending Vero Water Bottling Sys-tem.
Tap water is still available for 
free.
Served in a sustainable and sleek 
glass bottle, the Vero Water Bot-tling System considers its water “the world’s greenest premium bottled water.”  
The Jones Bside co-owner Maya 
V elesko agrees. When V elesko decided to implement the highly filtered water, she considered ev-erything, including the health, envi-ronmental and business benefits of the water.  
“In terms of the ease from a busi-
ness standpoint, it’s a machine that chills and filters on demand, so there is no need for ice, so that way we get rid of the conundrum of dirty ice and filtered water. Also, it’s aestheti-cally something I have been wanting to do,” Velesko said.
As with most change, V elesko 
recognizes that some members of the community are hesitant to ac-cept the newly added water cost and received some negative feedback about it.
“We work, every damn day and 
night, to create a business from the heart,” reads the first line of the res-taurant’s mission statement.
In taking that feedback and by 
informing customers of their reason-ing with the mission statement on the menu, V elesko hopes to get her message of sustainability across.
“I thought that by placing a re-
ally minimal fee on water, it would help raise awareness that, ‘Hey! This should be valued just like that glass of Coke or that beer that you’re buying,’” V elesko said. “I’ve seen people stand up and chug the last of their beer so that they don’t leave a drop of it and I really feel like people should start taking the same ap-proach to water.“
Finance junior Deirdre Steel sees 
the financial benefit of the Vero Wa-ter Bottling System from the restau-rant’s business standpoint and the rationale behind the controversial move.
“As long as the customer is no-
tified, I think charging for purified water is fine,” the 20-year-old said. “Abroad it’s not uncommon to be charged for clean water.”
Regardless of whether or not cus-
tomers are completely pleased with the progressive initiative, both agree that it is important to take steps to continue supporting environmental awareness and The Jones Bside in its strides toward sustainability.
“I think water a luxury that many 
Americans take for granted,” Steel said. “It’s sad, too many people in this world have no clue what pure water even means.”

◗ THE VEGAN DISHES ARE 
NOT ON THE MENU.
RACHEL KURLAND
Avenue Contributing Writer
The smell of freshly made 
dough and hot marinara sauce on 
the stove fills Bella Donna’s Ital-ian Eatery’s kitchen with scents of a home-cooked meal, and accord-ing to owner Joe Feulner, he hasn’t even started cooking yet.
“Gainesville’s a very unique 
city,” Feulner said. Since it opened in March, business has been going well, he said.
The New York native opened 
his family-style eatery intending to bring a little slice of New York-style pizzerias to Gainesville.
Feulner makes everything from scratch based on his own family recipes. He said food is like art — some people love it, and some hate it.
“Our main focus is putting out 
quality food,” he said.
His brother, Jeff, said Bella 
Donna’s combines elements of an authentic Italian eatery with a “true taste of New York style.” Nothing is frozen, he said. Everything is homemade and fresh to order.
Among the quality food at Bella 
Donna’s, Feulner is working on a new vegan pizza for his customers.
Vegans do not eat products that 
come from an animal, which made crafting a tasty pizza more of a chal-lenge, he said.
Feulner has made special dishes 
for his vegan customers in the past such as vegan white pizza or vegan pasta dishes, he said, but none are on the menu.
If a customer asks for a specific 
dietary dish, Feulner said he will make it.
“If I have the ability to make it 
and taste good, I’m gonna make it,” he said.
Feulner decid-
ed to make a veg-an pizza because his neighbors at Karma Cream in-sisted he do so.
Kyle Fick, the co-owner of Kar -
ma Cream, sampled the trial pizza.
“It was really good,” he said. Fick 
praised the great sauce, fresh veg-gies and excellent vegan cheese.
Fick enjoyed Feulner’s pizza be-
cause it was similar to other vegan pizzas he has had before. He said it was a simple and traditional pizza, but delicious nonetheless.
Feulner will add his vegan pizza 
to the menu once he finds a consis-tent vegan cheese distributor, he said. The cheese is expensive, but he knows it will please his loyal customers.
“The people of Gainesville know 
their food,” he said.
Feulner has gained a small cult-
like following of regular customers who frequent Bella Donna’s almost every day. His wife never turns customers away, he said, even if it is past closing at 3:30 a.m.
Mohammad Towakoli, a 45-
year-old Gainesville resident, has been a regular customer at Bella Donna’s since his friend took him to the new eatery. He went once for a slice of pizza and has habitu-ally returned since. He now visits at least three or four times a week.Towakoli likes everything about 
Bella Donna’s, from the food to the atmosphere.
He doesn’t care what the res-
taurant looks like — the people are welcoming and friendly, and the food is completely homemade, he said, so it feels like home.
Feulner commends the commu-
nity support that Gainesville offers for independent restaurants, such as Leonardo’s or Satchel’s Pizza. He looks up to those restaurants, because they have made a substan-tial impact in Gainesville by serving quality food.
As far as Feulner’s vegan pizza 
goes, his motto is that he will al-ways be willing to create something for a customer to eat, including cus-tomers with more complex diets.
“I hate seeing people walk out of 
here hungry,” he said.

Dear Mediocre Advice,
A nasty smell is following me. In two of my class-
es, with completely different students, I keep ran-
domly smelling something that I can only describe 
as a french-fry fart. Why is this happening?
Dear Mediocre Advice,
School is kicking my butt, and I’m ridiculously 
stressed. Do you have any suggestions for how to get through it without ripping my hair out?
Dear Friend,
Remember the words of the bleach-blond cutie, 
Zach Morris, “I like school. It’s a good way to kill time between weekends.” Just think of it in these simple steps: study, regurgitate, dump memory and repeat. But find time to do the things you love, or you really will go insane. Also, if it weren’t for school and jobs, we would masturbate all day and nothing would get 
done.  Dear Friend, 
You smell like a french-fry fart, or this proves my 
theory that ghosts fart. If you don’t find out where the smell is coming from, and it follows you home, a ghost 
with a weird sense of humor is haunting you.Dear Mediocre Advice,
A Cane, a Gator and a Nole: Who would 
you marry, who would you kill, and who would you bone?
Dear Questionable Friend,
Obviously, I would kill the Nole. I would 
slice it into little pieces, deep fry it and feed it to the poor because I’m a good person. I would have a one-night stand with the Cane, although I would blame it on the deadly amount of alcohol I must have con-sumed and regret it for the rest of my life. I would marry the Gator —  with a prenuptial agreement — and we’d live happily ever 
after. Dear Mediocre Advice,
What’s the best way to deal with a relatively tiny penis?
Dear Friend,
“I hope his penis is so small I can’t 
even feel it,” said no girl ever. Not every guy can be born with the gift that is Jon Hamm’s d**k. What you lack in size, you need to make up in skill. I mean, know how to use your hands and go south of the lady-border. That’s mandatory. You have to be at least borderline amazing at eating box because you won’t get an A for effort. If you can’t do either of those things, or you’re not even willing to learn, you may as well work on your personal-ity and hope the woman of your dreams thinks sex is yucky.This column is provided by Ariel Barnes, a 21-year-old majoring in international studies.

Ariel Barnes� THE BOTTLE LINE IS 
CALLED “TODAY I WILL.”
KARILLA DYER
Avenue Contributing Writer
Inspirational sayings make pop-
ular Facebook statuses. On Tumblr, 
powerful quotes layered over equal-ly powerful images are constantly reblogged.
Inspired to keep spreading posi-
tive messages beyond the Internet, 19-year-old English junior Sylvia Lai created “Today I Will,” a line of stainless steel reusable water bottles with  uplifting words printed on them.
Lai’s bottles are available for pur -
chase at www.bambouheart.com.
After noticing an influx of inspi-
rational statuses on her Facebook news feed, Lai realized the same concept could be applied to a reus-able water bottle design.
Each bottle is inscribed with a 
phrase meant to boost the bottle owner’s spirits such as “Today I will care” or “Today I will be me.”
The bottles’ shape is the same as 
old-fashioned milk bottles, which Lai said were the first reusable bot-tles in history.
Lai started her company, Bam-
bou Heart, with the help of her fa-ther, who is her business manager. As an English major, Lai had no pre-vious experience in production but has learned along the way.
“Things do not go the way you plan them, and you have to adjust,” Lai said. “I have definitely learned to adapt.”
Her father put her in contact with 
some of his business associates in China, who agreed to manufacture the bottles overseas. The biggest challenge Lai had to face was financ-ing  her product, which has been out of pocket so far.
Even with her struggle to find 
funds, Lai has linked her bottles to worthy causes. Half of the proceeds from her sales go to charity . She is fundraising for Enchanted Weekend at Give Kids the World, an event that provides all-expense paid fan-tasy vacations to sick children and their families.
Lai’s philanthropic ventures be-
gan her freshman year at UF when she founded a nonprofit organiza-tion, Wish Upon a Crane, to raise money for disaster relief in Japan.
She and her former roommate, 
20-year-old prepharmacy junior Au-drey Kandzer, made paper cranes by hand, which they sent to people who donated to the cause. All pro-ceeds went to the Red Cross, which then sent them to Japan.
“[Lai] is a statement to our cam-
pus community that we as students have just as much potential for great-ness as anyone else,” Kandzer said.
Outside her charity work, Lai 
designs a line of workout clothes manufactured from bamboo fibers that is sustainable, chemical-free and antibacterial, making them ideal for exercise clothes.
“I thought that maybe if I just 
switched the material and made it stylish and comfortable, maybe peo-ple would choose a different way of dressing while still helping out the environment,” Lai said.
Lai views her work as a fun 
hobby that requires great effort. She plans to attend law school and pos-sibly study business law, she said. With her business still in its infancy, she continues to run her website and searches for ways to market her products.  
Lai encourages other students to 
find their passions and become self-starters.
“Find the good in everything, 
and you will be inspired by what you can do and what you can do for others,” she said.

For today, I will depart from the regular 
movie-based focus of this column due to an 
amazing TV show recently available on Net-flix Watch Instantly: “Freaks and Geeks.”
The TV show aired for less than a sea-
son from 1999 to 2000 on NBC. Created by Paul Feig (director of “Bridesmaids”), it re-volves around two groups of friends clas-sified as the “Freaks” and the “Geeks” of William McKinley High School. Lindsay Weir, played by Linda Cardellini, is a new member of the Freaks, which is a drastic change from when she was a top student and a member of the mathletes.
Surrounded by burnouts, Daniel De-
sario, Ken Miller, Nick Andopolis and Kim Kelly, played by James Franco (“127 Hours”), Seth Rogen (“Knocked Up”), Jason Segel (“How I Met Your Mother”) and Busy Philips (“Cougartown”) respectively, Weir finds herself between the high expectations of her parents and teachers, and the desire to be cool with her friends.
In the Geeks, we have Weir’s younger 
freshman brother, Sam Weir (John Francis Daley). The diminutive younger Weir has two longtime friends, Neal Schweiber and Bill Haverchuck, played by Samm Levine (“Not Another Teen Movie”) and Martin Starr (“Knocked Up”) respectively, and nei-ther is in any way cooler than the other.
Although I was neither a high school 
student of the ‘80s nor a fully conscious hu-
man being when the show aired, I find that “Freaks and Geeks” looks at a sec-tion of the cafeteria that is generally avoided by high school TV shows. I don’t necessarily look at “Freaks and Geeks” as an accurate 
portrayal of high school. However, I enjoy that the show defies the genre high schools filled with jocks with soft insides and snarky pretty girls often found on television.   “Freaks and Geeks” has a great cast filled 
with now-famous faces. You’ll like it if you enjoy high school movies and TV, Judd Apatow productions and if you’ve always wondered if Jason Segel was always a giant of a man. SPOILER: He was.
Awesome Movie you’ve already seen: 
“Meet the Parents” (2000)
I’d be intimidated if my fiancée’s father 
was Vito Corleone, Jake LaMotta and the Fearless Leader from the Rocky and Bull-winkle movie.

L  ast season didn’t go how Mike 
Rosario planned.
  After sitting out 2010-11 because 
of transfer rules, the redshirt se-
nior missed a signiﬁ  cant portion of last season due to injury . Between a strained back, pain in his leg and a hip pointer, Rosario missed six games and 25 practices.
Coach Billy Donovan questioned 
Rosario’s toughness at UF’s media day on Wednesday.
  “In athletics you get measured 
more on what you do on days that you don’t feel well than on the days you do feel well,” he said. 
“We’re never going to put any of 
our guys in jeopardy to get hurt, but if you get a little tendinitis, you’re a little sore, you’ve got a thigh bruise, you have to work through that and push through that.
  “Mike had a hip pointer and was 
out for 10 days. I mean … that is just mind-boggling. Ten days for a hip pointer? My daughter could work through that.”
  During Rosario’s two seasons at 
Rutgers in 2008-10, he averaged 33.1 minutes per game. However, in his ﬁ  rst year at Florida, Rosario tallied only 14.4 minutes per game. 
  Before Rosario missed his ﬁ  rst 
game as a Gator against Mississippi Valley State on Dec. 19, he scored an average of 9.4 points per game. He averaged only 5.3 points per game

Redshirt senior guard Mike Rosario poses during Florida’s media day on Wednesday. Rosario struggled with injuries and inconsistency in 2011-12, averaging only 14.4 minutes per game.
  
  To the naked eye, the 
Florida defense has been dominant this 
season.
  The Gators have over-
whelmed opponents late in games, allowing just 13 second-half points all season and none in the fourth quar-ter.
As a whole, the unit ranks 
12th in the country in total defense.
  Despite UF’s early suc-
cess, the unit still has more to prove. Speciﬁ  cally, it needs to show it can shut down a mobile quarterback for an entire game.
  Florida has yet to face 
Georgia’s Aaron Murray, South Carolina’s Connor Shaw and Vanderbilt’s Jor-dan Rodgers this season, and all three gave the Gators trouble with their scrambling abilities in 2011.
  Murray ran for 42 yards 
on nine carries in Florida’s 24-20 loss to Georgia last season. 
Shaw rushed for 88 yards 
and two touchdowns in the Gamecocks’ 17-12 win against the Gators in Colum-bia, S.C. 
And   Rodgers, who Florida 
will face on Saturday, rushed for 41 yards in last year’s matchup — not includ-ing the 21 yards he lost on sacks. He also used his feet to make throws outside the pocket, racking up 297 yards in a 26-21 loss, the closest Vandy has come to upsetting UF since 2002.
  Based on Florida’s perfor-
mance against Texas A&M and dual-threat freshman quarterback Johnny Manziel, the Gators defense didn’t ﬁ  x the issue during the offsea-son.
  Manziel ran for 41 yards 
and a touchdown while completing 16 of 20 passes for 141 yards in the ﬁ  rst half alone. At halftime, the coaches stressed to the UF defensive linemen the need to limit Manziel by staying in their lanes and not over-pursuing to make plays in the backﬁ  eld. 
The Gators were more 
successful in the second half, limiting Manziel  to 19 yards on eight carries and only 32 passing yards.

  A safety leads the Gators in 
tackles. In linebacker leads them in 
sacks. 
  This isn’t a typical defense with 
a middle linebacker racking up 10-plus tackles in a game and a speed rusher at defensive end sacking the quarterback several times per con-test.
  No. 4 Florida does not have a player ranked among the top 25 in tackles in the Southeastern Confer-ence.  
  Yet the Gators are ranked 12th 
nationally in total defense.
  “The best player on our defense 
is our defense,” defensive coordi-nator Dan Quinn said.
  “Everybody’s making plays 
when you need to,” Bostic said. “Don’t try to jump out and make plays because, yeah, sometimes it works, but other times it may kill you. We said that from the start of camp: ‘You’ve got to let the plays come to you.’”
  A lack of 
d i s c i p l i n e and depth proved prob-lematic for 
the Gators last season.
  UF allowed 201 rushing yards 
per game in October against Ala-bama, LSU, Auburn and Georgia.
  Now, the Gators are deeper up front. Coaches have cut Omar Hunter’s playing time by about 30 snaps per game. 
  “That says a lot about our depth 
and being able to play a lot more guys,” coach Will Muschamp said.
“Some guys’ stats are a little 
skewed probably because they’re not playing as many snaps as they did a year ago, especially in the front seven.”
  Christy getting job done: Kyle 
Christy didn’t expect to go to Flor-ida.
  First, LSU needed to take no-
tice.  After the Tigers offered the 
Brownsburg, In., punter a scholar-ship early in June of 2010, Christy’s recruitment started to pick up.
  Impressive performances at 
college camps led Christy to a UF offer.   He committed to Florida on June 28, 2010, and enrolled early the next spring. 
  “I’ve given my high school 
coach so much credit for getting a scholarship because he’s the one who made me start punting in the ﬁ  rst place,” Christy said.

Although the Gators are welcom-
ing a program-record seven fresh-
men to the youngest team in UF his-tory, coach Amanda Butler has never been more confident. 
Despite their youth, the Gators ex-
pect to get back to the NCAA Tour -
nament. Butler thinks they have the necessary pieces.
“They have a tremendous op-
portunity , although they’re young, to really have that level of talent that could take us to another level,” But-ler said.
Last season, Florida snapped a 
streak of two seasons without an NCAA Tournament berth, earning a No. 9 seed. UF lost to eventual na-tional champion Baylor in the second round, but a majority of the contribu-tors from the Gators’ veteran-laden team are gone. 
Florida returns just 33.2 percent of 
the minutes played from a season ago and only 35.1 percent of its points. 
The Gators will be counting on 
the group of newcomers to help off-set the loss.“They are going to play early and 
often,” Kayla Lewis said. “There is no doubt in my mind that there will be significant minutes played by under -
classmen.”
Despite the influx of young play-
ers, Butler is optimistic. On the heels of last season’s success, she sees a more confident and capable team.
“There is certainly a cultural im-
provement in our pro-gram that is very , very signifi-cant,” she 
said. “I think it is present in champi-onship programs.”
Helping Butler maintain confi-
dence is the return of Jennifer George, last season’s team leader in points and rebounds.
As the only senior on the team, 
George said she has started embrac-ing the role of vocal leader on and off the court. She is ready to push the program forward in her final season.
“An SEC championship (for Flori-
da) has never been done on the wom-en’s side, ever,” she said. “We want to do that this year.       Florida freshmen expected to contribute heavily in 2012-13
UF Women’s 
Bask etballat Brownsburg (Ind.) High.
The sophomore, who punts 
with a size-11 soccer cleat, has 
made the most of his opportu-nity at Florida.
While he didn’t wrestle the 
starting punter job from rising senior David Lerner to begin last season, Christy became the starter by Florida’s sixth game.
He hasn’t looked back.Nine of Christy’s punts have 
been spotted inside the 20-yard line this season, and he pinned the Tigers inside their own 10-yard line three times on Satur -
day.
UF allows an average of 2.89 
yards per return, which ranks 17th in the country.
“There’s no really secret 
to it,” Vanderbilt coach James Franklin said. “They’ve got a good punter, he gets good hang time, and they’ve got a bunch of really good athletes on the field covering.”
Linebacker working his way 
back: Jelani Jenkins has been unlucky in 2012.
After missing UF’s games 
against Tennessee and Kentucky with a fractured right thumb he suffered against Texas A&M on Sept. 8, the junior weakside line-backer started against LSU.
But a hamstring injury ended 
his day early and put his sta-tus in question for Saturday’s matchup against Vanderbilt in Nashville, Tenn. 
Muschamp said on Monday 
that Jenkins would probably play against the Commodores.
“We’re pushing Jelani as hard 
as he can to get him ready to play,” Quinn said. “We certainly need him to, so we’re kind of taking it day by day.”

Riggs is improving since fractur -
ing his right foot one month ago, but remains out for Saturday.

Despite a three-week bout with mono-
nucleosis during the offseason, Patric Young 
passed his conditioning test on Tuesday, coach Billy Donovan said. The junior center returned to workouts on Sept. 19. 
“I would say a year ago, him coming off 
of mono, he would have never had a chance to pass it,” Donovan said. “I’ve seen some growth in him in that area.”
The 6-foot-9, 249-pound Young had trou-
ble dealing with fatigue as a first-time starter for Florida last season. He averaged only 26.5 minutes per game.
Young would have logged more time last 
season if he had maintained his intensity and done a better job of dealing with the bumps and bruises that come with increased action, Donovan said. 
“If you look at any frontcourt player that 
we’ve had here that’s been really effective, they’ve had a great ability to endure physical conditioning, and they’ve been able to play through fatigue,” Donovan said. “I think from a maturity standpoint, that’s an area where Patric has got to get better.”
Young’s stamina issues also put him in 
foul trouble in 2011-12. He led UF with 99 fouls.
Now healthy, Young is preparing for the 
increased minutes.
“Coach Donovan took me into his office 
the other day and … just told me there’s no reason I shouldn’t be able to play 32-35 min-utes a game,” Young said.
“I’m like ‘That’s a lot, but I can do it.’ It’s all mental.”Larson not on scholarship: Sophomore for -
ward Cody Larson is no longer on scholar -
ship but chose to return to the Gators as a walk-on, Donovan said Wednesday.
Donovan’s decision was 
based on Larson’s failure to handle his responsibili-ties on and off the court last 
season. 
Larson and senior Erik 
Murphy were arrested in 
April 2011 on charges of third-degree felony burglary. Larson previously received two years probation in February 2010 after shar -
ing Hydrocodone pills with a teammate.
“Obviously, I was disappointed, but I 
knew it was coming,” Larson said.Larson averaged 0.5 points and 0.8 re-
bounds per game last year. 
Donovan said Larson was given the op-
tion to transfer.
“I’m as proud of Cody today and maybe 
more so than I ever have been,” Donovan said. “I’ve seen a total change in him from the time the season ended last year to now up to this point in time. I think he can be a produc-tive player for us in the future.”
Larson’s switch to walk-on status leaves 
Florida with 13 scholarship players, right at the NCAA maximum.
“This is the best place for me, whether 
I’m on scholarship or not,” Larson said. “It’s perfect for me because I lost my scholarship. That sounds weird. But in life, that’s what’s going to make me become a man. I’m going to learn from this stuff.”

“[Rosario] needs to understand 
that the responsibility he has is 
school, class on-time, doing the things he knows he’s supposed to do, then on the court — practicing and playing the right way,” Dono-van said. “If he does those things then he puts me in a position to al-low me to play him more as a coach and he gets out of it what he wants to get out of it.”
Despite last year’s struggles, 
Donovan is starting to see a change in Rosario. Donovan said Rosario’s last three weeks have been his best since becoming a Gator, and he’s made a commitment to improving his work ethic, which developed partly because of his time playing for the Puerto Rican National Team 
dur -
ing the sum-mer. 
“The 
one thing that was very humbling for him was two-fold: one, not get-ting a chance to play a lot and our team still able to have some signifi-cant success last year,” Donovan said, “and then also playing on the Puerto Rican National Team and having to back up two NBA play-ers and play five minutes a game.”
Donovan hopes Rosario will put 
his previous setbacks behind him, which should lead to more time on the court. Rosario is ready to work to get those extra minutes.
“Whatever coach asks me to do 
to help my team in any kind of way, I’m willing to do,” Rosario said. “I’m just looking forward to being a consistent guy and just going out there and working hard.”

to blame. 
“When you talk about the opponent at the start 
of the week that’s one of the things that you talk 
about early,” Quinn said. “Is this a quarterback who wants to move the pocket and create on the run or is it more of a drop-back passer?”
Quinn added that UF’s defense needs to stay 
disciplined and keep opposing quarterbacks in-side the pocket.
“Certainly when you have a guy who can get 
outside you talk about what we say, taking care of the edges of the defense,” Quinn said. “To try to force the guy back inside at times in certain calls.”
The defense showed it had the 
ability to do so in the second half against Texas A&M, but it needs 
to play that way for four quarters to beat South Carolina and Geor -
gia. 
Containing Rodgers on Satur -
day would be a good first step in proving it can handle any type of 
quarterback.
