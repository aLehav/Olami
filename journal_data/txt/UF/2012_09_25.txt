A small kitchen ﬁ  re on a stove 
led to students living in Beaty 
Towers being evacuated late 
Monday night.
Gainesville Fire Rescue De-
partment, University Police and 
Alachua County Fire Rescue re-
sponded to a call at about 10:30 
p.m. Monday, said 19-year-old journalism junior Kaitlyn Pear-son.
Gainesville Fire Rescue Dis-
trict Chief James Lovvorn said a stove ﬁ  re in Room 602, on the sixth ﬂ  oor of Beaty East, caused thick smoke to ﬁ  ll up the room.
Students in Beaty East and 
West towers were evacuated and waited outside on the dorm’s parking lot as ﬁ  reﬁ  ghters used electric fans to blow the smoke 
out of the building.
Lovvorn said the ﬂ  oor had 
about 100 parts per million of 
carbon monoxide, which is con-
sidered dangerous in high levels.
Beaty residents were allowed 
back into the building at about midnight, but sixth-ﬂ  oor residents had to wait for another 20 minutes 
to be allowed back onto the ﬂ  oor.     One resident said when she opened her door inside Beaty 
East, she saw smoke in the 
hallway.
According to UF Housing and 
Residence Education’s website, up to 787 students live in Beaty 
Towers.
 Jamillah Khan was about half 
a page into an essay when she 
heard the beeping of room 602’s 
smoke detector.
The 18-year-old health educa-
tion and behavior major opened 
her door, only to be greeted by the sight of a solid basketball-
sized ﬂ  ame above her stove.
It wasn’t the ﬁ  rst time the 
stove had turned on by itself. 
On Sept. 17, the stove myste-

Diego Aguilar led a small group 
of volunteers through a wooded area 
off Southwest 62nd Boulevard.
Sweat dripped down his face as 
he sliced through the undergrowth with a machete, calling out into the wilderness for his missing nephew.
Shouts of “Chris” and “Christian” 
echoed through the forest as volun-teers walked several yards apart, ﬁ  ghting their way through thick brush.
Diego Aguilar, 43, and the volun-
teers were part of dozens of friends and family who searched the woods near Cabana Beach Apartments and State Road 121 on Monday for Chris-tian Aguilar.
Christian Aguilar, an 18-year-old 
biomedical engineering freshman at UF, was reported missing Thursday night after he was dropped off in the 4900 block of Northwest 13th Street, police said.
Police identiﬁ  ed Pedro A. Bravo 
as a person of interest in the case and put him under medical examination 
as part of Florida’s Baker Act after 
he told ofﬁ  cers Friday that he would hurt himself.
Gainesville Police spokesman Of-
ﬁ  cer Ben Tobias said that during an interview with ofﬁ  cers, Bravo, an Search for missing UF

Registering to vote is not always a top priority 
for busy students balancing extracurriculars with 
classes and work.
“The process just takes so long that people give 
up,” said Hazal Ebinc, a 21-year-old criminology 
and law, and political science senior. She is the 
communications director of the Bob Graham Cen-ter Public Service Council. “Once you have that bad taste in your mouth, you can feel kind of hope-less.”
The Bob Graham Center for Public Service, with 
the help of other civic-minded students, is attempt-ing to change that today, National Voter Registra-tion Day . The center will host its Swing the State: 
Voter Registration Roundup event from noon to 5 
p.m. at the Pugh Hall Ocora.
With the Oct. 9 registration deadline approach-
ing, the event aims both to register students and to promote political awareness. A marathon of “The West Wing” will be shown on a big screen, and re-freshments will be provided.TurboVote, an online voter registration service 
UF adopted this summer, will be available to get students registered quickly and easily.
Shelby Taylor, digital/communications direc-
tor for the Graham Center, said TurboV ote’s digital platform will make the voting process easier for 
students to understand.
According to TurboVote’s website, the service’s 
goal is to streamline the voting process by regis-
tering people to vote or updating their voter regis-
tration, getting absentee ballots and helping them 
vote by mail. It also sends reminders so people do not forget to vote.
“TurboV ote kind of gets through all the red tape 
and does the hard work for you,” Taylor said.
She said she believes that strong partisanship 
has made many students disinterested in political participation.
“Young people are really turned off at the di-Mass voter registration event today

The 10-year-old had a deter-

He grasped the small bat and 
squatted in his white uniform 
pants stained tan from clay . His 
stance would’ve been fearsome if 
his helmet didn’t look four sizes too big.
Gainesville Youth Baseball 
has long been a program that al-lows children to work off extra energy in a fun and safe environ-ment. But since the city had to stop overseeing the league due to 
a shrinking budget, some parents 
and coaches have complained of mismanagement.
“We had games canceled the 
day of with no prior warning,” said Dave Mitchell, who has two children in the youth baseball league. “They’ve changed our game times. We’ll show up and 
the other team tells us we for-
feited.”
The youth league transitioned 
from being a city-controlled league to a nonproﬁ  t, parent-run 
organization in 2010.
Michelle Park, assistant direc-tor of the city’s Department of 
Parks, Recreation and Cultural 
Affairs, said the department’s budget shrank by 20 percent from 2008 to 2011. Funding the program and providing the per-sonnel to support it proved too costly for the city.
“We had to transition,” Park 
said. “We help 
facilitate these programs, but at the same time, we have to use our staff for other pur-poses, too.”
Four par-
ents decided to 
create a governing board for the program, but only Victoria Clark and Mark Simonelli remain.
“Now there’s just two of us 
because lack of participation and volunteering from parents,” Clark said.
But some parents with the 
Gainesville Cobras — which has 
a 9-and-under team, a 10-and-
under team and an 11-and-under team — have become uncom-fortable with the way the board makes decisions.The Gainesville Cobras was 
in the Gainesville recreation league for the past few years but left to become a travel team this year because of trouble with the league.
“Parents are taking their kids 
and money and going other plac-es,” said Jason Upshaw, one of the Cobras’ coaches. “Only ﬁ  ve 
teams are left this fall.”
Last Tuesday , the Cobras met 
at Westﬁ  eld Park for one of their 
twice-weekly practices. As the boys were running drills, Mitch-ell, who is a parent volunteer for the Cobras, said he received a text from Clark telling him and his sons’ team to get off the ﬁ  eld 
before she contacted the police.
Mitchell said Clark added 
that the Cobras were interfering 
with a league team, which was practicing one ﬁ  eld over. 
“I told her this is the parents’ 
decision to let their kids practice with us,” Mitchell said. “She said,  ‘I don’t want to talk to you. 
If you say another word to me, 
I’ll have you arrested for harass-ing a board member.’”

Hundreds of eyes were on two 
men Monday as they debated the 
legalization of marijuana.
The University Auditorium was 
ﬁ  lled with attendees for Accent 
Speakers’ Bureau “The Great Weed 
Debate: Heads vs. Feds” event. The debate featured veteran Drug En-forcement Administration agent Bob Stutman and High Times editor Steve Hager.
Hager opened the ﬂ  oor and 
listed ﬁ  ve reasons why he believed marijuana should be legalized, and 
stated that funding to arrest mari-
juana growers and users should be stopped.
“Stop funding corruption, and 
don’t blame law enforcement,” he told the crowd. “They don’t make the laws.”
Stutman said marijuana should 
stay illegal and called out Hager for 
not mentioning facts — only what 
he considered to be opinions — and statements starting with “I believe.”
“The day we legalize marijuana, we will have more users,” Stutman 
said.
Gainesville resident and UF 
alumnus, McArthur Shelton, 30, 
said Stutman did a good job articu-lating his argument.
Shelton leaned toward the “feds” 
opinion on marijuana but suggested there should be a rehabilitation sys-tem for people who go to jail for 
marijuana.
At one point, Stutman said that 
if Hager told the truth, both would 
agree 100 percent on everything.
However, both speakers shared 
the view that marijuana consumers should not be sent to jail.
“I don’t believe people should be 
thrown into jail for any drug,” Stut-
man said. “It’s a stupid idea.”
The two previously debated sim-
ilar topics at UF in 2002, said Accent 
chairman Josh Holtzman. Although Stutman confessed the two are good friends, they each had opposing views and evidence to substantiate their arguments.
The debate lasted more than an 
hour and ended with an audience question-and-answer session.
“People clearly favored Hager, 
judging by applause,” said Paul Cirino, a 19-year-old telecommuni-cation junior.Speakers debate drugs 
Park
visiveness of political issues unless 
it will impact them directly,” Taylor said. “They also see two sides bat-tling but not a lot of resolution or compromise being built.”
She said the center’s main goal: 
to educate students on issues and encourage them to become active citizens.
Kelly MacLellan, a 21-year-old 
journalism senior and internal vice president for the Gator Coalition for Civic Engagement, said she agreed that the event should help students 
become more politically engaged.
The Gator Coalition for Civic 
Engagement acts as “foot soldiers 
and the voice of the Bob Graham Center” by helping connect leaders of student organizations and getting students interested in politics, Ma-cLellan said.
The coalition will be tabling at the 
event, and all students are invited to find out more about the organiza-tion and how they can join.
Morena Hadziselimovic, presi-
dent of the Bob Graham Center Pub-lic Service Council, said the Swing the State event will act as a stepping stone for students to become in-volved in the political process.
“I don’t think only one day will 
make a huge difference,” said the 22-year-old political science senior. “But if you can get one more person 
registered on that day, then you’ve 
done your job.”
18-year-old Santa Fe College student, admitted he got into a fight 
with Christian Aguilar.
Police said Christian Aguilar may be seriously injured.On Monday afternoon, GPD officers arrested and charged Bra-
vo with depriving a victim of medical care, which is a third-degree felony, according to a GPD news release.
Police booked him into Alachua County Jail at 3:51 p.m. Mon-
day, where he remained later that day with a $100,000 bond.
Officers from the Gainesville and University Police departments 
have been looking for Christian Aguilar since Friday night.
GPD helicopter and K-9 units have searched through areas 
where he might be.
Since Christian Aguilar’s disappearance, his friends and family 
have assisted police in the search.
Alexander Aguilar, 16, said his family drove from Miami on Fri-
day to look for his brother.
Alexander Aguilar said Christian Aguilar’s unknown where-
abouts has him, as well as his family, worried.
“Obviously, we want him back alive and well, but the fact that 
not knowing, like, how he is right now — what condition he’s in — is horrible,” he said.
The news of Christian Aguilar’s disappearance has reached be-
yond his family members in Miami.
Christian Aguilar is a recent graduate of Doral Academy Pre-
paratory School.
On Monday , Douglas Rodriguez, principal of Doral Academy , 
addressed the student body about Christian Aguilar’s disappear -
ance, saying that students and teachers drove to Gainesville to look 
for the former student.
Students in Miami have also shown their support for Christian 
Aguilar’s family.
Ashlee Perez, one of Christian Aguilar’s friends, set up an on-
line donation fund on Indiegogo for the Aguilar family.
As of press time, the fund has raised more than $1,800.
Supporters have also used Facebook and Twitter to spread the 
word about Christian Aguilar’s disappearance.
Erika Friman, Christian Aguilar’s girlfriend, created a Facebook 
group to update people who are following and participating in the search.
So far, the group has garnered about 2,600 members.Some of Christian Aguilar’s friends drove to Gainesville to as-
sist the family in the search.
Marcos Carriedo, a close friend, said he drove with about 12 
other people to Gainesville to help.
“We just want Chris back,” Carrideo said. “We just want to see 
Chris safe.”
On the Facebook group, a member asked if the search would 
continue Tuesday.
Another member replied, “Until we find him.”Contact Chris Alcantara at calcantara@alligator.org.4, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 25, 2012

Frank’s smoking proved problematic when 
he visited the doctor. The 58-year-old had 
been smoking since he was a teenager, but he wanted admission into an exercise program.
When the doctor found out about his his-
tory, Frank was immediately ordered to quit because cigarettes contain carcinogens.
But Frank wasn’t at risk at all. In fact, he 
doesn’t even exist — he was just a character played by 76-year-old Jimmy Johnson in order to help teach UF medical students how to in-teract with patients.
The Harrell Professional Development 
Assessment Center, part of the UF College of 
Medicine, uses standardized patients to let 
medical students practice everything from reading vital signs to performing prostate ex-ams.
Standardized patients are trained and paid 
to portray a specific patient problem in a con-sistent manner. Patients are people of all back-grounds, education level, cultures and experi-ences. Each is given a pretend medical history.
“What we do here is essential,” said Maria 
V elazquez, the director of the Harrell Center. “It’s one of the main things that make this place special.”
She said most people who know about the 
program heard of it through word-of-mouth. There are about 50 active standardized pa-tients who are paid $20 for training and $15 for each encounter.
The patients are used by physician’s assis-
tant, nurse practitioner, dental and even physi-cal therapy students.
Jack Harris has been a standardized patient 
for about 12 years. The retired Southern Bell Telephone Company employee said he wishes he had started the program earlier.
“It’s like I’m in a real doctor’s office,” said 
81-year-old Harris.
One time, Harris had to act as an irate pa-
tient.
“I was fussin’ at them and askin’ them why 
I had to wait so long,” he said. “The point was for them to be able to calm me down.”
Harris said he likes being part of the pro-
gram because he likes helping the students. Programs like these are needed for medical 
students because it gets them ready for the real 
world, he said.The center is always looking for 30- to 
50-year-olds because they normally work dur -
ing the day, but even toddlers have been used for pediatric students.The kinds of patients that come in are usually students, retired workers and people in between jobs, Velazquez said.
“It gives them something to do, and we cer -
tainly can use their help,” she said.
UF criminology senior Kelly Boyd has been 
a patient three times.
“It’s an easy way to make cash,” said the 
22-year-old. She said she plans to keep doing this part time until she graduates.
The medical students have to practice com-
munication skills and sometimes take the his-tory of the patient or perform a physical exam. 
They have to be able to ask the patient sensi-
tive questions such as if they are taking drugs or if they drink alcohol.

small piece of skin on her right shoulder.
Khan followed her roommate out into the hall 
screaming, “Fire, fire.”
Down the hall in room 606, David Placido was 
studying with friends in their dorm. 
The 18-year-old political science freshman and 
his friends grabbed their laptops and started mak-
ing their way down the stairwell.
But before he reached the parking lot, Placido 
decided to turn back.
“I live on the seventh floor” he said. “I didn’t 
want my stuff to burn up.”
He fought his way back up the stairwell to the 
seventh floor through a herd of freshmen descend-
ing down the stairs.
“There were a lot of people in the way,” he said. 
“They didn’t think it was a real fire.”
Pearson was in room 601 when the alarm went 
off but didn’t think it was a real fire.
“We’ve set the fire alarm off making toast,” she 
said. “We thought someone had just set it off.”When he made it to the seventh floor, Placido 
grabbed the fire extinguisher in the stairwell.
He noticed the extinguisher felt lighter than it 
should on his way back to the room.
He blasted the flames, which had grown to about 
the height of his torso, but the fire extinguisher quickly ran out and harsh smoke that smelled like 
a mixture of burnt plastic cups poured into his face 
and down his lungs, making it hard to breathe.
He ran out of the room, back down the stairwell, 
this time to the fifth floor, and grabbed another fire 
extinguisher. 
This time, the vessel seemed full.
Placido bit down on his gray undershirt and 
charged back into the room. 
By that time, the ceiling was engulfed in smoke. Once again, he unleashed the extinguisher on 
the flames, putting out all visible signs of fire before a RA grabbed his shirt and pulled him out of the room.

Hallie Peterson left microbiology 
class early to head to her job, rush-
ing through the pouring rain to get 
to her car. 
But a small package in a puddle 
caught her eye.
A pile of damp checks and cash 
sat on the ground on the parking lot. 
Peterson, a 19-year-old Santa Fe Col-lege nursing sophomore, scooped up the $2,655 bundle Sept. 18 and immediately started looking for its 
owners. 
Peterson, who works her way 
through college on her own, helped 
get the money back to its owners.
“It would be nice to have that 
much money,” she said, “because I could definitely use the money.”
She said she’s worked three jobs 
at once to pay her car insurance, bills 
and other expenses. 
Her phone was on the fritz re-
cently because she couldn’t afford 
the minutes.
When Peterson found the money 
— four checks totaling $2,255 and four $100 bills — she and her boy-friend researched the company listed on the checks and gave the bundle to 
police on Friday.
Peterson, who said she hopes to 
transfer to UF next year for nursing, 
left class 30 minutes early on Tues-
day to drive to her job at Hollister in the Oaks Mall and saw the clump of 
papers next to her car.
“I was walking to my car, and usu-
ally when I see things on the ground, I just pick them up out of curiosity,” she said. “I picked it up, and then 
when I realized what it was, I looked 
around. I was just shocked.”
“At first I was like, ‘Is this a test?’ 
It was unreal. Four $100 bills. That’s 
just mind-blowing to find on the 
ground,” she said.
She quickly called her boyfriend, 
20-year-old Tony Wyatt, to tell him 
what she’d found. 
Wyatt, a UF civil engineering 
sophomore, was walking from his 
statics class in the New Engineering Building when he got her call.
“It was ridiculous,” Wyatt said. “I 
didn’t believe her at first.”
He said they didn’t know what to 
do right away because it isn’t often 
that someone misplaces more than 
$2,000.
“Our friends were telling us to 
pocket the money and throw away the checks,” he said, “but it just didn’t feel right.”Peterson said it reminded her of 
when she lost almost $400 in a Target shopping cart when she was young-
er.
“I was devastated,” she said.
Peterson said money is a big deal 
to her because she completely sup-ports herself.
“If I would have lost that much 
money, I think I would have died,” she said. “I would know how some-body else would feel if they lost the 
money, and I would not want any-
body else to feel like that.”
Peterson said she contacted Santa 
Fe College the next day and said she couldn’t get an answer about what 
to do. 
So Wyatt helped her research the 
tire company the checks were ad-
dressed to and discovered it was a 
transportation company, Wyatt said.
Peterson contacted the compa-
ny before calling Santa Fe College 
again. 
They told her a woman from the 
company had reported the missing money.
She gave the money to the Santa 
Fe College Police Department be-
cause police said it was safer for the 
woman to collect it from them.
Peterson said she’s relieved she 
doesn’t have the money anymore and hopes the owner gets it back.
Wyatt said he hopes the per -
son gets in contact with Peterson to thank her.
“Who knows, maybe they’ll give 
her some free tires,” he said.TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 25, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 5

Be careful who you 
talk to in El Paso 
We love a good viral video.
Cat sitting on a bench? Classic. 
Compilation of dudes trying to extreme skate-
board or bike ride? Always awesome.
The latest video taking the Internet by storm comes from El 
Paso County in Colorado.
Someone in a Safeway recorded a video on her cellphone 
when she noticed something funny about a volunteer who was registering voters outside of the store. She saw that the volun-teer had begun asking people which presidential candidate they would vote for before offering to register them to vote.
The woman who recorded the video asked the volunteer 
who she is working for.
“Well, I’m actually trying to register people for a particular 
party . Because we’re out here in support of Romney , actually ,” the young woman replies. “We’re working for the County Clerk’s Ofﬁ  ce,” she said.
This created a reaction from the video recorder.“And you’re only registering Republicans?” The video re-
corder says with outrage, to which the young woman replies, “No.”
“You said you’re only registering Romney people,” said the 
video recorder.
The voter registration volunteer replied, “Well, we’re trying 
to, to be honest.”
The video was recorded about a month ago, but it has only 
recently surfaced. The El Paso County Clerk & Recorder issued a statement on Sunday regarding the video.
“The statement made in this video is both unfortunate and 
inaccurate,” said Clerk & Recorder Wayne Williams.
The volunteer might have been confused about who hired 
her. Instead of working for the County Clerk’s Ofﬁ  ce, she works 
for Romney’s campaign, according to 9NEWS in Colorado.
 “It’s clearly just a campaign tactic that someone is trying to 
use to damage the Romney campaign image and a young lady 
trying to get involved,” said Eli Bremer, the chairman of the El Paso County Republican Party, to 9NEWS.
How is recording someone’s answers a campaign tactic? “Even if you can ask preference questions,” said El Paso 
County Democratic Party Executive Director Christy Lelait to 9NEWS, “... the goal is to register people ... She does make it 
very clear she does want to register Romney supporters.”
The woman who recorded and posted the video to YouTube 
has denied requests to take it down because it contains inaccu-
rate information. Quite frankly, good for her.
This is the kind of voter fraud that people should be upset 
about. If volunteers are being asked which candidate they’re going to vote for before being allowed to register to vote, then that’s something very sneaky that should be addressed.
The girl featured in the video might not know that just 
because she turns in registration forms to the County Clerk’s 
Ofﬁ  ce, doesn’t mean that she works for it. She just might not 
know.
You know what they say, ignorance is Mitt.A little common courtesy goes a long way
Fifty-ﬁ  ve years ago, nine black students entered Central 
High School in Little Rock, Ark. — not without some 
controversy and special assistance, however.
President Dwight D. Eisenhower had more than 1,000 
members of the 101st Airborne Division of the U.S. Army es-
cort the Little Rock Nine into the school in order to see that they were safe.
I respect these students for having the courage to be the 
ﬁ  rst of their race to attend an all-white institution that was, at the time, charged with extremely closed-minded senti-ments.   
In the midst of the prejudice, discrimination and hate that 
seemed to rule the era, an act of kindness in regard to these students’ well-being catapulted numerous other signiﬁ  cant events. Doing something unconventional, and at the time so-cially unacceptable, for the beneﬁ  t of a few would eventually make all the difference in how this country treats people of all backgrounds.
Today kindness, courtesy and respect are principles that 
are often overshadowed. In a strange way, many see display-
ing too much of these attributes as the equivalent of being 
weak.
The fear of being walked over, taken advantage of, reject-
ed or overlooked drives many away from them. The defense mechanism of always putting up a guard seems to be more socially accepted and expected.
We have encounters with such a vast variety of people 
over the course of our lives. We will work, study and social-ize with people who are different from what we are accus-
tomed to and especially different from what we like. Conﬂ  ict 
is inherent. Ideas and personalities clash.
It’s how you choose to handle these moments that decides 
whether the experiences turn out to be positive learning les-sons or harmful mistakes.
It’s important to remember that in the future, people who 
knew us in the past will more than likely only remember cer-tain things about us. There’s a very high chance it won’t be what organizations we belonged to, what awards and hon-
ors we received or even things like how extreme we could be 
in our opinions.
People most vividly remember the interactions and rela-tionships they have with others. How we treat everyone around 
us will more than likely determine 
how we are both seen and remem-bered. 
For some reason, it feels like 
it’s in our nature to focus primar-ily and sometimes exclusively on our own wishes.  People even willingly hurt others in pursuit of 
obtaining their own desires.
Proving our point, making sure we get the credit or striv-
ing to always take away the largest personal gain are some of the ways we idolize our egos.
Try avoiding that mindset for a little, and see how things 
change for you. After being hastily approached with an issue or treated with minimal cordiality, I’m able to understand that everyone doesn’t embody certain principles the same way . Despite this, even after sometimes inconveniencing myself to help someone else, I can’t think of a time when it 
turned back on me or ruined anything I had going.
Spending an entire lifetime criticizing others or treating 
them with little regard for no reason makes little sense to 
me.
I have a feeling the world would function much more ef-
fectively if people placed more emphasis on human regard and mutual respect rather than self-gratiﬁ  cation and a twist-ed idea of self-achievement.
Life is full of stresses. It’s what we take from them that 
gives meaning. This week, you may ﬁ  nd yourself sleep de-prived and strung out on caffeine. The stress of your job may be eating at your mental health. Your hands may feel perma-nently attached to brightly colored course review packets.
Remember that it’s OK to smile at someone or do a good 
deed and seek no reward — it just might make you feel a little better.
What goes around certainly comes around. You never 
know how the smallest demonstration of courtesy or cordi-
ality might actually turn around to work in your own favor.

We live in a world where communication has dras-
tically transformed in the past few decades.
Not only do we speak in person, on cell-
phones, via Skype and FaceTime, but we text, tweet, post statuses, blog and submit Instagram photos. We are a cul-
ture more connected than ever, and this connectivity has 
inspired a seemingly infinite number of new platforms in which speakers can express their beliefs and opinions.
When it comes to the realm of news, this means news 
consumers have a larger and more diverse buffet from which to choose where they get their information. With the convenience of abundance and variety , however, comes questions — questions about authenticity, origin and that fidgety little thing called truth.
During the weekend, I read a news story titled “Mitt 
Romney Accused of ‘Dyeing His Face Brown’ for Univi-sion Interview.”
Apparently, last week Romney went on the channel, 
which has a Latino demographic, for a “Meet the Candi-dates” forum with a darker, somewhat more orange com-plexion than usual. This prompted left-wing blog Demo-cratic Underground to conclude Romney had somehow made his face darker, with the implication that he was 
trying to look more like Univision’s viewers.
My reaction to the headline and story was one of hu-
mor. I first thought it had to be a Saturday Night Live 
sketch because of the obvious bizarreness of it all, but upon further investigation, I was a little discouraged by the story’s angle.
While I’m not a fan of Rom-
ney, nor would I enjoy an after -
noon playing polo with him on 
his estate, I highly doubt he is 
the type of person who would change the color of his face to ap-
peal to an audience. I believe, while I don’t agree with his politics, he is a good and decent man.
There is mudslinging going on in this campaign, but 
it’s not necessarily by the candidates.
Our news sources — those hordes of journalists who 
feed us our information and their opinions via email, 
the Internet, newspapers and more, constantly twist and 
shape our beliefs about Barack Obama, Mitt Romney, their running mates, their wives and their campaign staff.
And we let them. As I mentioned previously, there is 
danger in getting our news from only one or two sources, but there is also danger in getting news from all sources. No person is perfect, no journalist or news aggregate has entirely clean and pure motivations.
When we take the information from one, two or any 
number of news sources to be fact, we are doing our na-tion and ourselves a disservice.
For some reason, we don’t trust ourselves anymore. 
We think we need Rush Limbaugh, David Brooks, Ari Shapiro or any other number of talking heads to interpret Barack Obama, Mitt Romney and their people for us. But the thing about a presidential election is this: It’s about people. It’s about one man’s beliefs and vision versus an-other’s, and it really shouldn’t be that complicated. Yet, 
we make it so, and we let others manipulate us into think-
ing we need the manipulation.
I’m proposing we take these men for who they are, by 
what they say and what they are doing.
The story about Mitt Romney’s darkening his skin 
probably isn’t true, but some folks are going to let that story shape their opinion of him, possibly quite sharply.
What should matter to voters is what Mitt Romney 
said during the forum — the beliefs he expressed there and the vision he has for our country.
Let’s remember who we are and where we want to 
go as individuals, as well as a community, not where the people with the platforms and money want to take us.
And while we try to get there, however strenuous the 
journey might be, let’s remember to trust ourselves and the beliefs we have about people.
News is good, and opinions are an important part of 
democracy, but so are people.
Let’s be a community that takes the time to learn about 
people — not just the gossip about them.

UWireWe believe in free speech. We believe this even when 
a video as offensive as it was poorly done causes riots throughout the world. It is important that we 
remember that.
However, it is also important that we remember the pur -
pose of free speech.
Free speech exists to defend a minority position. It does 
not exist to discriminate arbitrarily against a group.
As the riots in the Middle East peaked last week, the 
French magazine Charlie Hebdo published lewd depictions of the prophet Mohammed despite numerous objections.
The editors defended their decision in the name of free 
speech. They called it a satire of the film and the news domi-nating our headlines of the demonstrations and violence 
that it has triggered. Stephane Charbonnier, the director of 
the magazine, stated explicitly that this “grotesque film,” not the prophet Mohammed, was the target of the cartoons.
Why , then, do the cartoons depict Mohammed naked 
and performing sexual acts? What is the point of these car -
toons in the wake of violence and death?
Clearly, they can exist only to insult and inflame reli-
gious tensions. In the context of the past week, these car -
toons are no longer idiotic and petty caricatures but threats 
to the safety of many in the region. Multiple French consul-
ates and embassies have closed in anticipation of potential repercussions.
Saturday , Nicholas D. Kristof wrote in The New York 
Times about the relationship between violence and insults to Islam. It is true that other religions do not react violently to religious insults. It’s also true that many Muslims counterprotested and apologized for the recent pro-tests.
But by manipulating religion, an 
extremist group transforms a cheap and amateur video into a call to arms against the West’s hatred of Islam and its way of life.
Last Wednesday , the Obama administration defined 
the attacks on the United States consulate in Benghazi as intentional acts of terrorism. There is strong evidence that the groups behind these attacks initiated the protests and even more evidence that they have exacerbated the conflict in pursuit of their own ends.
We can only understand the danger of the French car -
toons within this context. Any exploitable content is ideo-logical ammunition. The right catalyst could ignite the re-gion and mobilize an extremist group from the periphery to the center of power.
The purpose of free speech does not just depend on its 
initial context. It also depends on the use of that speech in the public sphere, where any group may manipulate its use.
The Middle East remains suspended on the edge of insta-
bility, and any event may tilt the balance. “A revolution isn’t an event, but a process,” Kristof writes.
And he is right, but certain events may accelerate the pro-
cess and cause it to ignite.

Apple has been up to a lot re-
cently.
In addition to releasing the 
iOS 6 update, Apple has people claw-ing to get the new iPhone 5, so much 
that preorders for the iPhone 5 sold out 
in less than an hour of its unveiling.
This begs the question: Is it worth it 
to get an iPhone 5?
For many Apple users, the answer is 
obvious. For others, it is natural to be a little skeptical about purchasing a new iPhone, even if it is the most updated version — for the time being, anyway.
If you currently own an iPhone 4S, 
it might not make a lot of sense to buy an iPhone 5, but e-commerce websites such as eBay and Amazon are offering cash and gift cards for your phones.
The iPhone 5 comes with some fairly 
high-tech features, such as iCloud and a new processor, the A5, which uses power more efficiently and increases the phone’s processing speed. You can also take panoramic photos with the iP-
hone 5’s updated camera features.  
But even though Apple consistently 
meets the standards of its clientele with 
its range of iPhone products and wields the most influence with its brand name, the iPhone 5 may not be the best choice in terms of smartphones.
For example, the Samsung Galaxy 
S III has a longer maximum battery life and a much larger screen. If you’re looking for something more afford-
able, the HTC One X costs half as much as an iPhone 5.
If you keep the phrase “keeping up 
with the Joneses” near and dear to your heart, you might as well upgrade to a sleek and new iPhone 5. But if you’re unfazed by stylish phones and current trends, you may fall in love with the phone you least expected to notice.

UF School of Art + Art History graduate 
students now have more space to create.
The new Graduate Research for Art Devel-
opment studios, also known as GRADhaus 
studios, is a 7,000-square-foot warehouse 
complete with high ceilings, 25 partitioned 
studio spaces, wireless Internet and air condi-tioning.
It will officially open to the public at 7:30 
p.m. Friday during Artwalk Gainesville. GRADhaus, which will be open for visitors at least once a semester, will be christened with a champagne toast.
The space, located at 818 NW First Ave., 
started being used in August by art and tech-nology, creative photography, drawing, paint-ing and printmaking graduate students.
“This space is as good as any warehouse-
oriented graduate studio space in the coun-try ,” said Richard Heipp, director of UF’s School of Art + Art History. “I think our stu-dents are thrilled to finally have space that al-lows them to do the kind of work they want to 
do in a community-oriented environment.”
Prior to the move to GRADhaus this se-mester, Master of Fine Arts graduate students were using what Heipp described as “ad hoc 
spaces” such as old dorms in Ben Hill Griffin Stadium and basement areas in Norman Hall as art studios.
“Those were really not highly suitable for 
graduate studios but were the only spaces on campus we could get,” he said.
Quality of space is not the only improve-
ment the new GRADhaus facility offers.
Rent for the off-campus studio costs 40 
percent less than what was being paid in fees for the scattered studio spaces around cam-pus, Heipp said. He wouldn’t disclose the amount.
“That was part of the reason we were al-
lowed to pursue this,” Heipp said.
Heipp said that half of the about 50 gradu-
ate art students use the GRADhaus space, 
adding that some students have different stu-
dio space needs, like those studying ceramics or graphic design.
“We are trying to promote a community en-
vironment so that learning across disciplines happens much more frequently , rather than being isolated to their studios,” said GRAD-haus studio space manager Logan Marconi.
Marconi, 28, is a third-year graduate stu-dent in painting. He spends 40 hours a week at GRADhaus using his studio while also making sure that the roughly 25 students fol-low the rules of the space outlined in their stu-dio contracts.
GRADhaus, unlike past work spaces, has better air circulation and desegregation among concentrations. Heipp said it features cleaner, nicer, bigger and better-lit spaces.
“It really is a big upgrade,” Marconi said. 
“If you had seen the space that I was coming 
from, this is 100 times better.”8, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 25, 2012

The blurred taillights of the bus 
driving away sent Jessica Chandlee 
into a panic.
She realized she had left her key 
on the bus.
Chandlee, a 22-year-old mechan-
ical engineering fifth-year, was com-ing home from 101 Cantina late one Friday night. Her friends got back on the bus and searched for the key , but they couldn’t find it. The night ended with a call to an emergency locksmith at 3 a.m. to open Chan-
dlee’s apartment.
She said she knew about the 
Regional Transit System’s lost and 
found, but she ended up buying a new key because “it was less of a hassle.”
RTS’s lost-and-found collection 
is at the administrative office, 100 SE 10th Ave., said Chip Skinner, RTS 
marketing and communications 
supervisor. He said there are some misconceptions about the lost and found  — for example, people show 
up to the downtown station instead.For directions to the right place, 
people can call RTS’s phone line, lis-
ten to the prompt and press the cor -
responding numbers.
About 40 items are turned in 
to the lost and found every week, Skinner said. Of those, about two or three are bikes left at the front of the bus. If no one claims them, RTS donates them to groups like the Ala-
chua County Fire Rescue and St. 
Francis Catholic High School, which both hold bike drives around the holidays.
The most interesting items are groceries, Skinner said. In the past 
four years there have only been two 
or three incidents of groceries being left on the bus. In those cases, if there are perishable items, RTS employees immediately try to find the owner, he said.
The administrative office holds 
an item for 30 days. After that, em-ployees recycle or dispose of it. But 
Skinner said people are quick to get 
their items, and clerks immediately try to contact the person if there’s any identifiable information.
If it’s a student ID, the RTS em-ployees take it to the University Po-
lice Department or the Santa Fe Col-
lege Police Department. Other IDs that are unclaimed are shredded to avoid identity theft.
Skinner recommends that people 
mark their keys, too — for Chan-dlee, hers did not have any identifi-able characteristics.
Skinner said there is no gender, 
race or residential group that tends to leave items on the bus more than others.
“All walks of life have left things 
on the bus,” he said.

The UF International Center will 
host its Fall Study Abroad Fair from 10 
a.m. to 3 p.m. Wednesday on the Reitz Union Colonnade.
Students can learn about study 
abroad opportunities from represen-tatives of the various UF and non-UF programs, said fair coordinator De-lainie McNeil.
Some programs that will have tables 
set up at the fair include Latin Ameri-can studies and photojournalism. Ac-cording to the International Center’s 
website, trip locations include Germa-
ny, England, China and Tanzania.
“I didn’t realize how many options 
you have to choose from,” said Sara Kesneck, a 19-year-old communication sciences and disorders sophomore.
Students can explore different op-
tions for paying for study abroad trips at a financial aid table. The deadline to apply for scholarships for Spring study abroad is Sept. 28, while the applica-tion to study abroad is due Oct. 15, McNeil said.
“We are hoping to capture an audi-
ence of students who are interested in studying abroad,” she said.
Meghan Pryce, a 19-year-old jour -
nalism sophomore, studied abroad in Greece and Spain with the College of Journalism and Communications this summer.
“It is an indescribable experience.

Some UF researchers have challenged 
diabetes patients to sum up their disease in 
five snapshots.
Ashby Walker, associate professor and 
chair of social sciences at Mars Hill College, 
is co-investigator of the project. She said she 
has been in collaboration with doctors from the UF Diabetes Center of Excellence on a clinical trial called the Diabetes Photo Proj-ect since the summer of 2010.  
The researchers gave participants dispos-
able cameras and told them to take five pic-tures about what diabetes means to them.
The research explores the experiences 
of youths who live with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes and their parents or guardians through surveys and visual storyboards, ac-cording to the UF at Shands website.
During a survey, participants were told 
to list each picture and explain why they took it.“Understanding the youth perspective 
could help us improve clinical care,” Walk-er said. “It can also help with advocacy and general awareness.”
Walker said more than 40 children have 
completed their surveys and returned their cameras.
“The beauty and power 
is the information that they 
have offered and the time they have shared with us,” Walker said.
Shannon Lyles, who is a 
Type 1 diabetic, is a regis-tered nurse specialist and certified diabetes educator with UF Pediatric Endo-
crinology and was involved in the trial by helping to recruit patients to participate.
“I don’t think anything like this has been 
done before,” Lyles said. “Giving them a camera and letting them put their feelings 
out there gives the study credibility and 
opens up future studies.”
Walker said there are some interesting 
trends in the photos.
“They tend to take photos of foods they 
cannot have or are off-limits,” she said.Diabetes patients capture

 �MOST OF THE PLAYERS WILL 
BE FINE FOR FLORIDA’S GAME AGAINST LSU ON OCT. 6. 
  ADAM PINCUS
 Alligator Staff Writer
   
 Muschamp introduced the catch 
phrase “Man down, man up” after 
Florida’s game against Texas A&M, and the words have never been more relevant.
  Unfortunately for No. 11 UF, that 
means the injury issues have not gone away . Heading into the bye week, 
Florida not only has to get ready for a 
home matchup with No. 3 LSU, they have to get healthy.
  Offensive tackle Chaz Green (left 
ankle), defensive end Dominique Ea-sley (left knee), tight end Jordan Reed (head), defensive end Sharrif Floyd (shoulder) and Trey Burton (back spasms) should be ready to go against the Tigers, Muschamp said on Mon-day. The extent to which they’ll prac-tice will be determined as the week progresses.
  Green has missed each of the past 
two games with a left ankle injury. 
Easley sat out Saturday’s game due 
to swelling and a sprain in his left 
knee, which was surgically repaired after he suffered an ACL tear on Nov . 26 against Florida State. 
  Reed likely suf-
fered a concussion when he had his helmet knocked off 
by a pair of Kentucky defenders after a 25-yard catch in the second quarter.  Floyd suffered the shoulder injury during Saturday’s game. 
  Linebacker Jelani Jenkins suffered 
a broken thumb against the Aggies on UF dealing with injuries JURNY DUTY
  Will Muschamp isn’t putting much stock 
in the Gators’ latest win, and neither should you.
  Saturday’s 38-0 shutout of Kentucky was not 
an accurate measuring stick of how the team has progressed.
  Muschamp made it clear throughout his press 
conference on Monday that he was not totally satisﬁ  ed with his team’s performance simply be-cause the ﬁ  nal score looked pretty.
  “Pleased where we are, but also realistic that 
we have a lot of improvements to make with our 
football team,” Muschamp said. “We met yester-
day as a team and I told our guys, starting with me all the way down, we all have room for im-provement.”
  Outside of Jeff Driskel’s 38-yard run midway 
through the ﬁ  rst quarter on Saturday , the Gators managed only 11 yards on nine offensive plays in their ﬁ  rst three drives. Driskel will not get free so easily against the defenses of LSU, Georgia and 
South Carolina.
  Florida has yet to ﬁ  nd a consistent offensive 
rhythm early in games, especially passing. While 
Driskel threw a few nice passes against Kentucky, 
he also made several late throws and poor deci-
sions.   In a third-and-5 
situation on the Gators’ second offensive pos-
session, Driskel had 
Frankie Hammond Jr. open to his left on a curl route. He waited a sec-
ond too long to get the 
throw off, which gave 
Wildcats cornerback Martavius Neloms enough time to close the separation and make a play on the ball. Hammond caught the pass once it was 
batted in the air but only gained one yard.
  Muschamp acknowledged the problems with 
the passing game and said they would be ad-
dressed this week, but he didn’t leave it at that. 
He spent more than half of his opening statement 
listing issues the team still needed to work on, in-cluding areas that obviously weren’t a problem on Saturday, such as red-zone defense.
  Florida’s defense didn’t key in on the run early 
despite the total lack of an aerial attack posed by the Wildcats and backup quarterback Morgan Newton, who completed just 7 of 21 passes for 48 yards and three interceptions. Kentucky ran for Despite rout, Gators not perfect   JOE MORGAN

 Andre Debose has disappeared.  He led the Gators in receiving yards last 
season, but has yet to catch a pass in 2012.
 Most of his playing time has come in 
the return game, and even those reps de-creased signiﬁ  cantly against Kentucky. In Saturday’s 38-0 win, Debose sat out the en-
tire ﬁ  rst half.
  “He just needs to practice better,” coach 
Will Muschamp said of Debose’s limited 
playing time. “If he practices better, he’ll play more.”
  After halftime, Debose returned two 
punts for 8 yards. He muffed the ﬁ  rst punt, marking his second straight game with a fumble.
  Aside from 13 kick and punt returns 
through four games, Debose has been largely uninvolved in 2012. 
When playing wideout, Debose has rare-
ly been targeted.
  Perhaps his most effective plays this sea-
son were misdirection routes on Trey Bur-ton’s two touchdown runs against Tennes-see on Sept. 15.
  “That’s not him,” Driskel said on Sept. 
10 of Debose’s limited looks in the passing game. 
“He’s not the one throwing to himself. 
We have a bunch of playmakers. We’re try-
ing to distribute the ball evenly. Obviously you have your progressions on each play. You don’t design them for certain people; 
you design them for certain routes. It’s not 
anything he’s done wrong.”
  When Debose signed with Florida in 
2009, he was the No. 2 wide receiver recruit 
in the nation. 
At the time, former UF coach Urban 
Meyer compared Debose’s speed and style of play to former Gator and All-Pro NFL wide receiver Percy Harvin.
  However, Debose and Harvin have not 
shared the same career trajectory.
  Harvin scored 
32 touchdowns and averaged 11.6 yards per touch running 
and catching the ball as a key player on two national championship teams. 
Debose has underwhelmed with just ﬁ  ve 
career starts at wide receiver in two-plus seasons.
  One area in which Debose has excelled 
where Harvin did not is in the return game. Debose holds the school record for kickoff touchdown returns with three and has aver-aged 26.7 yards on 46 career kick returns.
  However, unlike Harvin, Debose has 
struggled to consistently perform well at wide receiver. 
He has averaged roughly one catch per 
contest during his college career. Debose mostly absent due to struggles with consistency

Sept. 8 and has had a cast on his right 
arm ever since undergoing surgery on Sept. 10. Muschamp said then he expected the senior linebacker to be 
out four weeks.
“I’ll know more later in the 
week,” Muschamp said on Monday. 
“I don’t right now. I don’t have the information right now, so I think he sees the doctor Wednesday.”
With injuries come opportunities. 
Freshman linebacker Antonio Mor -
rison started for Jenkins the last two 
weeks and racked up seven tackles.  
Defensive ends Jonathan Bul-
lard and Earl Okine platooned in Easley’s place against Kentucky and 
helped hold the Wildcats to the low-
est completion percentage against 
the Gators all season.
In three Southeastern Conference 
games, UF has seen its fair share of bumps and bruises.
Junior offensive tackle Matt 
Patchan hasn’t seen the field in any of them. An offseason pectoral strain 
has kept him off the field. In his four 
years at Florida, he has received two medical redshirts. Muschamp said he planned on Patchan playing at some point this season.
“He had some tear on the mus-
cle,” Muschamp said. “It’s a painful 
injury and up front you’ve got to be 
able to use that to be able to block. 
Rehab has gone well. He’s worked 
extremely hard as far as that’s con-cerned.”
Green, his replacement at right 
tackle this season, has played well, but an ankle injury has opened the door for guard Kyle Koehne to move outside. On the other side of 
the line, left tackle Xavier Nixon has 
struggled in pass protection due to a 
shoulder injury . 
“He’s had a legitimate injury there,” Muschamp said. 
“He’s a guy who has pushed 
through it.”

Junior defensive end Sharrif Floyd limps off the field during Saturday’s 
38-0 win against Kentucky at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium.
Young players capitalizing on chances
five yards per carry and converted 50 percent 
of its third downs in the first quarter.
“Let’s accentuate on the negatives of our 
football team right now and understand what they are, and let’s get better,” Muschamp said.
By focusing on the negatives, Muschamp 
is taking the right approach. Florida was sup-
posed to cruise on Saturday . The positives 
were expected, while the negatives were con-cerning.
The Gators started 4-0 last year, defeating 
the Wildcats by the same margin. UF then lost 
consecutive games to Alabama and LSU by a 
combined score of 79-21. 
In impressive second halves on the road 
against Texas A&M and Tennessee, Florida 
showed more positive flashes than it did 
through four games in 2011. So an upset against LSU next week is not out of the question, but a win over a Kentucky team that couldn’t beat Western Kentucky shouldn’t be a reason for 
Gators fans to be more confident. 
For some teams, a 38-point shutout might 
indicate that all is good. For others, it can mask 
more serious issues. Florida falls into the latter 
category.
Luckily for the Gators, Muschamp already 
came to that realization.

org.INJURIES , from page 13
JOSH , from page 13But when Debose catches 
the ball, he makes an impact. 
In addition to leading the 
Gators in receiving yardage, 
he paced the Southeastern Conference with 27 yards per catch during the 2011 sea-
son. Each of his four career 
touchdowns has measured more than 63 yards, but all occurred in games decided by 22 points or more.
Muschamp and offen-
sive coordinator Brent Pease have given Debose limited in-game opportunities to 
improve on his receiving 
numbers this season. The depth chart released before UF’s game against Kentucky listed Debose tied for sec-
ond with true freshman La-
troy Pittman behind Frankie Hammond Jr. at X receiver.
“There’s a key to every 
kid, and we’ve got to find that key to motivate any young man ... day in, day out, to consistently perform well, to consistently do it 
the right way,” Muschamp 
said. “Generally, your prac-tice habits carry over to the game.”
Debose’s struggles to 
crack the lineup this season have been documented since 
Florida’s fall camp began in 
early August. 
Four weeks into the sea-
son, Debose has yet to make 
a significant impact for the 
Gators.
Muschamp said Florida 
would focus on self-improve-ment during the bye week. 
As far as Debose’s per -
sonal list of priorities was concerned, Muschamp was blunt.
“Effort as much as any-
thing,” Muschamp said. “Just consistently doing it the right way. It’s consistently doing it the right way. Consistent 
effort.”

Entering last weekend, Allie 
Will was the last UF freshman to 
win her first three singles match-
es, doing so in 2009. 
In 2012, Will was the No. 1 
ranked singles player in the na-
tion, finishing her career with a 
record of 109-13 in three years 
at Florida before turning pro in June. On Sunday, freshmen Dan-
ielle Collins and Brianna Morgan matched Will’s debut with three straight wins at the Wolverine In-
vitational in Ann Arbor, Mich.
This was the Florida women’s 
tennis team’s first action since 
winning their second straight NCAA Championship in May.
“We got pushed more and 
played better,” associate head coach  Dave Balogh said. “There were a couple close matches, and it was good to see us dig deep 
and keep our composure.
“I liked the passion and en-
ergy we came out and showed 
on the court. Our upperclassmen 
did a great job of getting every-
one fired up for the afternoon, and it showed.”
The fire showed in Collins and 
Morgan, who won all of their sin-
gles matches. Collins won all six matches she 
competed in — three singles and 
three doubles — while Morgan 
won her three 
singles matches 
but lost her three 
doubles tilts.
After a slow 
start in which 
the team opened 
the tournament with a pair of 
losses in doubles, the Gators fin-ished the weekend strong. 
“We started a bit rusty in 
doubles and that can be expect-ed since this was our first tour -
nament and competition of the year,” Balogh said. 
Collins and junior Olivia Jano-
wicz were crowned the tourna-
ment’s doubles champions on 
Sunday after going undefeated in their three matches. The duo won   24 of their 30 games.
In singles, Florida won 16 of 18 
matches during the invitational. 
Sofie Oyen, Caroline Hitimana 
and Janowicz won each of their three singles matches.

Coach Mary Wise said 
some of the offensive num-
bers Florida has put up have 
blown away her preseason 
expectations. 
The Gators are the No. 1 hit-
ting team in the Southeastern 
Conference, and their high-
powered attack has bailed out UF’s ugly side: defense. 
Wise said that because her 
squad’s attacking has been so 
effective, other integral parts 
of the game don’t have to be up to par. 
The defense, which ranks 
last in the SEC in digs and ninth in both opponent hit-ting percentage and average blocks per set, has fallen short of this year’s expectations.
But with senior Tangerine 
Wiggs leading the conference with a .465 hitting clip, the Gators offense has picked up 
the slack left by the defense. 
“These are not numbers 
we would have predicted,” 
Wise said. 
“But if we can get [Wiggs] 
scoring points night in and night out (and) hitting a high efficiency, at least that will make up for when we can’t stop the other team. At least 
we’re scoring points.”
Florida’s .318 hitting clip 
is 30 points higher than Mis-
souri, the next closest SEC 
school. 
The Tigers boast a .288 hit-
ting percentage, and they are 
also the most recent recipi-
ent of a three-set sweep at the 
hands of the Gators.
UF allowed 63 points 
against Missouri on Friday, and Wise said the Gators 
didn’t live up to their defen-
sive potential.
“We still think there’s lots 
of room for improvement,” she said. 
“Balls that aren’t blocked that should be, balls are land-ing and we think we can dig. ... It’s something that will come in the future. But it does 
have some potential.”
Until Florida’s defense can 
catch up to the level of play of 
sophomore libero Taylor Un-
roe, who won SEC Defensive 
Player of the Week on Sept. 17 and ranks fourth in the league with 4.47 digs per set, the Gators will have to rely 
on the play of a few offensive 
threats.
Junior Taylor Brauneis  
tops the SEC in assists per set 
with 11.43. 
Junior Chloe Mann and 
freshman Ziva Recek are in 
the top five in kills per set.
Wise said it’s still too early 
to compare her offense with others around the nation, but she said her team is speaking for itself on the court.
“There are some rotations 
that it’s tough to defend all three hitters in the front row, or even a two hitter is tough to defend,” she said. “Our of-
fensive numbers have proven 
that. I’d like to keep them go-ing.”

By nature, Havana Solaun is a 
calm person.
So when senior and fellow mid-
fielder Erika Tymrak suffered a 
left ankle sprain in Friday’s match 
against Tennessee, Solaun kept it together.   
“When you lose a player like 
Tymrak,” Solaun said, “everyone kind of has to … step up their own 
game to balance out the loss.”
Solaun, a sophomore, rose to the 
occasion for Florida in two games 
this weekend, notching a goal and an assist. 
She is the Gators’ current leader 
in points with nine (three goals and three assists). 
“She’s such a composed player,” 
Tymrak said. “When they have a bunker and they have nine play-ers sitting behind the ball, she’s the type that’s not going to freak out. She’s going to pick her spot, hit it low.”
Coach Becky Burleigh added: 
“Havana is one of those players who can cerebrally help break down a team like that. She’s patient. She’s 
not panicky.”
Solaun scored her third goal 
of the season in Florida’s 4-1 rout 
of Georgia on Sunday. During a scuffle for the ball in the box, junior Maggie Rodgers retrieved it, turned around and fed Solaun the ball. 
Solaun buried the ball into the 
far corner of the net in the 65th min-
ute to give UF a 2-0 lead. 
On Friday against the Volun-
teers, Solaun edged down the right 
flank and sent a wide cross to red-shirt senior McKenzie Barney for a 
tap-in, giving the Gators a 2-0 lead 
in the 53rd minute. 
“It’s big,” Solaun said. “We’ve 
kind of really been stressing finish-ing off games. This weekend, we did a good job of putting the ball in 
the back of the net.”
Last year, Solaun took on the 
role of super sub, starting in only 
four of her 21 games played. She 
finished as Florida’s fourth-leading 
scorer with 18 points on six goals and six assists. 
This season, Solaun has started 
nine of 10 games in the attacking midfield. 
She averages 73.1 minutes per 
game — 26 more than she did last 
year. 
Solaun’s skill advancing the at-
tack with her fast-break runs has 
given the team a boost this year, Burleigh said.
“The reason that Havana has 
been so dangerous is because she works really hard to get beyond the 
ball when we’re bringing the ball 
up,” Burleigh said. 
“She’s doing an excellent job at 
that, and again, (that’s) not some-thing you can necessarily put in a stat book.”
Solaun’s ability to feed the ball 
to others has been a major factor in her success. 
Her field vision is terrific, Bur -
leigh said. 
“If I was defending her, I’d have 
to choose,” Burleigh said. “Do I step up and play her tight so that she doesn’t score by herself, or do I give her a little space? But if I do that, then maybe she’s going to get 
somebody else in. “There’s kind of a pick your poi-
son with her.”
Injured Gators: Burleigh said Tym-
rak is day-to-day with a left ankle sprain suffered in Friday’s win against Tennessee. 
“Her ankle is getting better,” 
Burleigh said. “But obviously, until 
you actually test it and see what it’s 
like, we won’t know where she is.”Tymrak, an All-American, said 
her injury isn’t severe. 
“I’m just trying to get as much 
treatment as I can,” she said. “I can 
walk on it.”
Barney left Sunday’s game with 
an undisclosed injury in the 86th minute after the Bulldogs scored their first goal. Burleigh said Mon-
day the team would evaluate Bar -
ney’s status later in the day.
Redshirt senior Kat Williamson  
is also day-to-day, Burleigh said. 
Williamson, an All-American 
center back, has been rehabbing her right knee since suffering a menis-cus tear against FIU on Sept. 2. 
She has missed five games since 
sustaining the injury. 
Gutsche Returns: After suffering a 
concussion in practice nearly two weeks ago when a ball bounced off the crossbar and hit her head, soph-
omore midfielder Karina Gutsche 
played the final 16 minutes against 
Georgia.
Gutsche started in two matches 
this season before missing four 
straight games preceding Sunday.16, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 25, 2012
