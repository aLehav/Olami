Four restaurants that are 
popular with UF students 
are among the city restau-rants that have been hit with health-code violations in the past ﬁ  ve months — including some that result-ed from an inspection as recent as Friday . 
The restaurants includ-
ed 101 Cantina, Boca Fiesta, Designer Greens and Cop-per Monkey.
No restaurants required 
shutdowns, and most res-taurants had violations that stemmed from food-temperature violations, according to records from the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation. 
In a health inspector’s 
report from Nov . 15, 101 Cantina had 14 violations ranging from having an open beverage on a table where food is prepared to having small, live ﬂ  ies in the dish area.
The inspector noted 
there was food residue  built up on a cookline reach-in cooler. The report also stated fajita chicken cooked more than a week prior hadn’t been thrown away . The food was tossed during the inspection.
The restaurant had also 
installed carpeting in a dry storage area and had not cooled cooked black beans from 135 degrees to the state-required 41 de-grees Fahrenheit within six hours.
The restaurant has in-
cluded a change in manage-ment as part of its cleanup approach.
New manager Josh Lo-
wenstein said Tuesday he wasn’t able to speak about the violations because he wasn’t working there at the time. However, he said, he plans to hold the restaurant to higher standards.
Part of that, he said, in-
cludes improving quality across the board — in both food and working environ-ment. 
To keep live ﬂ  ies from 
buzzing around the dish-washing station, he said his plan is to emphasize cleanliness, which includes having employees scrub the kitchen when business is slow.

to walk away with a clean inspection haven’t been as

Santa Fe College has added extra 
police ofﬁ  cers, lights and self-defense 
classes on campus after the Jan. 12 kid-napping.
An 18-year-old Trenton woman 
was abducted in a campus parking lot. She escaped that night and is tak-ing classes again, according to a news release on the SFC website. 
The Santa Fe College Police Depart-
ment is using more ofﬁ  cers during school hours, and at times, members of the Alachua County Sheriff’s Of-
ﬁ  ce and University 
Police have been brought in. 
SFCPD has 
added lights in a parking lot in the northwest corner of campus and by the Health Sciences An-nex, the southern-
most building.
SFC is also offering students extra Rape Aggression Defense classes. The class will be taught four times in Feb-ruary and three times each in March, April and May.
The kidnapper has not been caught. 
The suspect stands between 5 feet 8 inches and 5 feet 11 inches, and is in his late 20s or early 30s. He has short hair, an unshaven face and a tattoo on his right hand, according to the Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce.
He drives a small, dark pickup trick 
with tinted windows and a gray inte-rior.

� THE AIRLINE WILL BRING 
ABOUT 60 JOBS TO THE CITY.
  BENJAMIN S. BRASCH
 Alligator Writer
  A new airline will bring about 
60 jobs to the city when it sets up 
shop.
  Silver Airways Corp. an-
nounced Friday it plans to move its maintenance department to Gainesville Regional Airport, a move that will primarily create maintenance jobs, said Darrell Richardson, CEO of Silver Air-ways. 
   “As many local people as we 
can hire, that’s our objective,” Richardson said.
  A new, state-of-the-art mainte-
nance hangar was a huge pull for the airline, Richardson said.  The company, based in Ft. 
Lauderdale, will house its two new Saab 340Bplus aircrafts in the maintenance hangar.
  Richardson did not give a time frame for the move, because, he said, the company is still ﬁ  naliz-ing the speciﬁ  cs of the plan.
  Local maintenance workers 
will be hired to support the new airline, he said.
  About 30 percent of the Ft. Lau-
derdale workforce won’t come to Gainesville, said Ian Fletcher, board chair for the Gainesville-Alachua County Regional Air-port Authority.  “This new airline will be a 
great resource for the local com-munity and students,” said May-or Craig Lowe.
  In the past two years, the 
Gainesville Regional Airport has gone from having two airlines to four airlines, he said.
  “Not only will there be addi-
tional airline service, but a brand new maintenance hangar will bring jobs,” Lowe said.

Mexico police: robber rode skateboard to banks 
MEXICO CITY  — Mexico 
City police say they have arrest-
ed a would-be bandit who rode his skateboard to bank robbery attempts.
Police say Sergio Ledesma 
and his skateboard have been turned over to prosecutors after he allegedly attempted to rob two banks by whispering threats to tellers.
Police say the teller at the first 
bank simply acted as if he hadn’t heard Ledesma, who then skated off to a second bank.
The second teller told police 
Ledesma appeared to whisper a threat. 
So the teller set off a silent 
alarm, and counted out the mon-ey while the would-be robber waited patiently.
Police said Friday Ledesma 
was still waiting when they ar -
rived and arrested him.

Utah school passes on ‘cou-
gars’ as mascot 
SALT LAKE CITY — A Utah 
school district has decided 
against using “Cougars” as a mascot for a new high school in part because of the nega-tive connotation of the word in popular culture.
Canyons School District 
Superintendent David S. Doty says the selection of “Chargers” as mascot was driven by the desire for originality, despite a poll of some future students that showed 26 percent in favor of using the cougar.
At least three Utah schools, 
including Brigham Young Uni-versity, use cougar as a mascot.
Doty says public comments 
reflect a desire to be different, but he also notes that some see the word cougar as carrying a “negative double entendre.”
The term cougar in popu-
lar culture can refer to women in their 40s who have sex with younger men.

UF and four other universities each 
received a portion of a grant donated by 
AT&T to UTeach, a national program that trains math and science teachers.
The National Math and Science Initia-
tive announced Thursday that the grant supports the UTeach programs at UF, the University of California at Berkeley, the University of California at Irvine, the University of Northern Arizona and Flor -
ida State University. The grant, which totaled $500,000, was divided evenly be-tween the five schools. 
UF’s program, UFTeach, is the only 
undergraduate program for a math or sci-ence education degree, said Dimple Fle-sner, associate director of UFTeach. The program started at UF in Fall 2008 and is modeled after the UTeach program at the University of Texas at Austin.
Students in the program get an educa-
tion minor  that qualifies them for teach-ing certificates in Florida public schools. 
Flesner said UFTeach has not yet 
discussed how the 
money will be dis-persed, but it could go toward operating expenses, student recruitment, instruc-tional materials or toward tuition. 
UFTeach pays 
part of the price for 
the introductory classes and a three-cred-it summer course. 
The program is a collaboration be-
tween the College of Education, the Col-lege of Liberal Arts and Sciences, the Col-lege of Agricultural and Life Sciences and the College of Engineering. It features field experience in classrooms.
The first UFTeach class had 41 stu-
dents, Flesner said. By the end of this semester, there will be 24 graduates of the program. By 2015, she said, the pro-gram hopes to have 60 students graduate yearly . 
“I want more students who have a 
passion for teaching that also possess the math and science content knowledge,” Flesner said. 
UFTeach was started with funds pro-
vided by the National Math and Science Initiative. The funding ends this year. 
“It is so crucial to have continuing 
funds for this program that trains future STEM teachers, so we can continue to improve education in Florida,” Flesner said.

The start of early voting for Gainesville City Commission 
and the Republican Presidential Preference Primary elections, 
heralded by speeches and music, saw about 750 people vote this weekend.
On Saturday, the first day of early voting, 362 people voted, 
said Pam Carpenter, county supervisor of elections. On Sunday, 395 people voted.
Early voting continues until Saturday . Election Day is Jan. 31.
Carpenter said early voting this year was slightly different 
from previous years. This year, she said, early voting started on a weekend and lasted six hours on Saturday . Previously , early voting started on a weekday and lasted eight hours.
Will Boyett, county chief deputy supervisor of elections, said 
the change makes comparing this year’s early voting attendance to previous years difficult because it’s like comparing apples and oranges.
To take advantage of early voting, people can go to the Su-
pervisor of Elections County Administration Building, the Mill-hopper Branch Library or the Tower Road Branch Library.
“Early voting gives voters more flexibility in casting their bal-
lots,” Carpenter said.About 750 people vote early during weekendFlesner

Boca Fiesta, Designer Greens, Copper Monkey had violations
successful as Lowenstein hoped. 
Though the flies are gone, inspec-
tors found four new violations in an 
inspection Friday.
Four of them were repeat vio-
lations, including finding that the black beans were not cooled down enough and the offending carpet had not been removed.
Lowenstein declined to comment 
on the new violations.
Boca Fiesta was cited for food-
temperature violations on Nov . 29 when the inspector found 13 viola-tions. One of the violations was that a mini-fridge used to store soy milk and salsa was not cooling the items properly.
Warren Oakes, an owner of Boca 
Fiesta, said the fridge was immedi-ately tossed and a new one was put in its place. 
The report also mentioned a 
build-up of slime in an ice machine. He explained the slime built up 
when people opened and closed the door to the ice machine. The build-up was on the door’s underside. It had never touched the ice and was not immediately visible inside the machine, which is how it went un-noticed. 
It has since been cleaned and 
added to a list of items to clean be-fore the restaurant closes each night.
Oakes said there are two kinds 
of violations: those that come from mechanical failure and those from human error. 
In the case of those stemming 
from mechanical failure, he said he has since replaced all malfunction-ing parts and machines. 
In the cases of human error, he 
said he sends out a notice to em-ployees with their paychecks to de-tail what employees will have to do to avoid the incidents in the future. Those instructions are also listed in-side the restaurant.So far, he said, it’s worked. Oakes said the health violations 
trouble him because the restaurant is his baby . 
“We’re a part of this community . 
We live here,” he said. “We eat here, too.” 
Designer Greens had four health 
code violations on Jan. 11, including one that Designer Greens owner Ste-ven Kay called a stroke of bad luck.
The restaurant employs the “fast-
casual” style where customers can select ingredients to add to their sal-ads as they go down a line, similar to Chipotle or Subway . 
At Designer Greens, those ingre-
dients weren’t being chilled prop-erly, he said.
Kay blamed the issue on faulty parts in the refrigerators that were used to chill the ingredients. 
An inspector noted on Jan. 11 the 
ingredients were being kept at a tem-perature of 48 degrees Fahrenheit in-stead of 41 degrees Fahrenheit. 
The refrigerators have thermo-
stats, which are designed like air conditioners, Kay said. They switch on to cool the ingredients at the ap-propriate moments. 
However, when those parts fail, 
the still-operating refrigerators don’t do their job correctly and violations happen.
He previously failed an inspec-
tion for the same violation. The day after the first failure, he said, he brought in a repair company to fix the refrigerators. He said he spent $700 on the repair. 
However, the company gave him 
thermostats he likened to cheap auto parts. 
Two months later, he said, his 
refrigerators broke on the day of his follow-up inspection. 
Now, he said he could face even 
larger fines. 
Kay said this particular infraction 
is a common one — an easy rule to break but also an easy one to fix.
He said ingredients that get 
warmer than 41 degrees Fahrenheit are still allowed to be served for up to two hours after they pass that bar -
rier.
Copper Monkey had 10 viola-
tions when it was inspected Jan. 11. 
Though it was not cited for food-
temperature infractions, the report showed the restaurant had been storing raw chicken and shrimp above french fries in a freezer. This was corrected on site. 
The report also noted residue 
buildup on racks in a walk-in cool-er.
Officials from Copper Monkey 
were not able to be reached for com-ment.

UF students use off-cam-
pus tutoring services more 
than on-campus tutoring, ac-cording to the 2011 Students’ Experience in the Research University, or SERU, survey. 
The survey, which gath-
ers information about under -
graduate campus life, showed that freshmen, sophomores and juniors go to off-campus tutoring sessions more than on-campus sessions. 
Off-campus tutoring was 
also rated higher than on-campus tutoring for each group. 
The survey listed Broward 
Teaching Center as an ex-ample of on-campus tutoring, and TutoringZone was listed as an example of off-campus tutoring. 
About 10,000 to 12,000 stu-
dents use TutoringZone each semester, said TutoringZone Chief Financial Official Paul Hintze, 36.
In the survey, the per -
centage of students who had used off-campus services was greater than the percentage of students who had used on-campus tutoring by at least 20 percent for each group.    
Eighteen-year-old applied 
physiology and kinesiolgy freshman Lauren Wysocki has used the Broward Teach-ing Center for help with her chemistry homework. She likes that it is convenient and free for students.
She said a lot of people in 
Broward Hall use the teach-ing center, but she feels like other students do not know about it. 
Nineteen-year-old ad-
vertising sophomore Kristin Bartlett credits TutoringZone with helping her pass her mi-croeconomics class. She has also used Broward Teaching Services. 
She said she had trouble 
getting one-on-one tutoring during exam time at Broward and the tutor she worked with could not explain things more than one way. 
Bartlett said she would go 
back to TutoringZone. 
“If you get a really hard 
question right,” Bartlett said, “they chuck candy at your head. It’s not a traditional straight learning facility.”

vices declined to comment on the survey.More students

A Gainesville man was arrested and charged with 
aggravated child abuse after he hit his girlfriend’s baby 
Thursday night, according to Gainesville Police.
Sheron C. Jones, 35, of 5029 NE 24th Ave. unit 247, hit 
the 3-month-old, 13-pound baby because she wouldn’t stop crying, according to a Gainesville Police Depart-ment report. The back-right part of the baby’s head is fractured, and doctors found a bruise and bleeding in her brain.
According to the report, Jones told police he was tak-
ing care of his girlfriend’s baby while she worked. He was so frustrated with the baby’s crying that he hit her twice in the back of her head with his left hand. The baby continued to cry but eventually fell asleep.
The next morning, Jones said the right side of the baby’s face and her right eye were both swollen, and the baby’s mother took her to the Pediatric ER at Shands at UF. Jones was arrested at 9:18 p.m. Friday after a Florida Department of Children and Families investigator alert-ed police.
Jones originally told police he accidentally kicked the 
baby while running through his house with the lights off. He then said he tossed the baby on a mattress, and she bounced off before falling face-first on the ground, according to police.
Finally , Jones changed his story a 
third time, saying he slapped the baby 
in the back of the head.
Jones was held at Alachua County 
Jail on a $75,000 bond Sunday night. 
On Nov. 21, he was also charged with burglary and 
grand-theft larceny.Man charged with hitting infant

� HE WAS A LOCAL SWIM COACH.
KELLY PRICE
Alligator Writer
In a scene that seemed to be straight 
from “Dateline: To Catch a Predator,” a 
former youth-league swim coach was arrested in connection with a child sex predator sting. 
Authorities said Bryan Woodward, 
of Gainesville, drove 124 miles to have sex with a 14-year-old he met in an on-line chat room.
Woodward, 29, was arrested in Osce-
ola County on Jan. 9 on counts of travel-ing to seduce a child to commit sex acts and using a computer to solicit sex with a  child, authorities said.
He told police he was a head swim 
coach at Gator Swim Club, a division of Swim America that practices at the O’Connell Center. Most of the swim-mers he coached were under 18.
Woodward was one of 40 suspects ar -
rested as a part of Operation Red Cheeks, according to the Osceola County Sher -
iff’s Office. Others arrested as part of the sting operation were a professional golfer, an eighth-grade teacher, a retired Georgia beekeeper and eight students, including one who is in high school.
According to a Sheriff’s Office affida-
vit, Woodward chatted and exchanged photos online with an undercover detec-tive who he thought was a 14-year-old.
“How do I know ur not a cop or 
something,” he said to the detective via chat. “I could show up and the cops could be waiting for me.”
He arrived at the neighborhood where 
the undercover house was located and drove around before authorities arrested him. He had purchased M&M’s on his way for the child, authorities said.
Linzi Sheppard, a coach who worked 
with Gator Swim, said she was shocked by the news.
 “I would have never expected this,” 
said Sheppard, 22.
Sheppard remembered Woodward 
as an always-professional colleague and a remarkable coach. They exchanged small talk often because they shared the pool deck most afternoons from June until about December.
“My impression of him was that he 
was definitely a dedicated coach as far as caring about the swimmers and ev-erything,” she said. “I would just notice he would push them and want them to do the best that they could while they were at practice. Clearly there was no [suspicion], anything that I would rec-ognize.”

A 10-foot-tall cardboard skyscraper pup-
pet plastered with corporation logos pumped 
its huge arms over a chanting crowd at the Alachua County Courthouse on Friday.
The puppet, carried by four members of 
Occupy Gainesville, symbolized what the protesters wanted to change.
They had marched to the courthouse as 
part of Move to Amend’s Occupy the Courts event, calling for an amendment to reverse the 2010 U.S. Supreme Court decision that allows corporations to donate unlimited amounts of money to politicians.
“We want to restore personhood to the 
flesh people in the money-equals-speech equation,” said Occupy Gainesville member Zot Lynn Szurgot.
At Friday’s event, Bo Diddley Community 
Plaza was crammed with people of all ages. After a skit, songs, poetry and speeches, the event’s honored guest, best-selling author Cornel West, took the stage. 
Szurgot said West had planned to be at the 
Move to Amend protest at the Supreme Court in Washington, D.C. But when he found out he’d be in Gainesville that night on an anti-poverty tour with talk show host Tavis Smi-ley, he contacted Occupy Gainesville.
“I wouldn’t want to be in any other place 
but Gainesville, Fla., today,” West said. 
He was arrested in October for demonstrat-
ing on the steps of the U.S. Supreme Court with Occupy D.C., according to Politico. In his speech in Gainesville, West men-
tioned the “poison at work in these corpora-tions” and called poverty in the U.S. an ethi-cal abomination.
“Occupy is so crucial. Move to Amend is 
so crucial,” he said. “There is deep, unapolo-getic love at the core of what we’re trying to do.”
The end of his speech was met with a 
standing ovation.
“It’s like plugging into a power socket 
when he speaks,” said John Berger, 66, a member of Occupy Gainesville.
At about 2:50 p.m., West led the crowd on 
its three-block march to the courthouse.
Dogs, children and adults walked in a 
pack along sidewalks and flooded into the streets. Someone drummed a beat, and pro-testers repeated chants such as, “The people united will never be defeated.”
West sang along enthusiastically, dancing 
with the crowd. When they reached the court-house, he took pictures, signed autographs and chanted for about 20 minutes. At about 3:15 p.m., West left by car, but many of the protesters remained in awe of the event.
“It was empowering to know that so many 
people have one voice and one message,” said Claudia Youakim, 32.Author speaks to Occupiers
“Occupy is so crucial. Move to 
Amend is so crucial. There is deep, 
unapologetic love at the core of 
what we’re trying to do.”

Hangout to meet with a TA for office hours? Capitalism best policy to eliminate poverty
Friday night at the Graham Center for Public Policy , talk show host Tavis Smiley and Princeton academic Cornel West passionately advocated for the poor and 
disenfranchised. I have no question as to the genuine sincer -
ity of their compassion for the impoverished. 
However, when they named specific policies designed to 
eliminate poverty in America, I could not help but think how much poorer the 99 percent would become. Their support of a wealth tax, higher taxes on investment income and a liv-ing wage, whatever that means, sound like they will fix our country’s problems when in fact this menu of policy choices would do much to run America into the ground. 
I asked West what he would do to change the U.S. tax 
code, to which he replied “you got to go where the money is … I’m in favor of a wealth tax.” This would amount to taking a set percent of a person’s net worth each year. A guest on National Public Radio recently suggested 3 percent. When 20 percent of Americans have 85 percent of the nation’s net worth, I can see how a well-meaning progressive would think something like this would fix income inequality . 
However, imagine we live in a world where your parents 
have to pay 3 percent of all their savings each year. I bet a lot more money would be spent on consumption and people wouldn’t bother saving, as the interest payments from trea-sury bonds now would not even cover the tax on wealth. The balance between consumption and savings would be shift-ing so rapidly in favor of the here and now that there would be no capital left over to actually get people out of poverty, rather than just give them food stamps and call it a day.
The reason the poor can get jobs (and, on a related note, 
the reason government exists) in the first place is because of people who invest money and generate economic growth. If a drastic investment tax were coupled with a wealth tax, the rich would be fine. They would simply move assets overseas or otherwise shelter wealth while the millions of Americans who would lose their jobs might have some trouble mak-ing house payments. In the short run, I have no doubt that it would look like poverty is be-ing eliminated. The working poor would have more money to spend while investors still have their capital tied up and unavailable for better opportunities elsewhere. However, money migrates gradu-ally to where it can earn the best return. If a billionaire goes from paying $100 million in taxes per 
year to $200 million per year and 1,000 people lose their jobs in the process, how is this progressive?
Those demanding living wages for the poor would be 
happy to know that the vast majority of the impoverished make higher than the minimum wage. 
If companies are forced to pay “living wages,” today’s 
level of outsourcing will look like a joke compared to all the new factories that would spring up overseas. Living wages would likely only be great for the suburban teens working at Hollister and might cause Wal-Mart to figure out less costly ways for meeting staffing needs.  
West and Smiley said poverty is the greatest challenge of 
our time. If this is true, they should trust the only historical system that has led to widespread prosperity in human his-tory, which is capitalism. The great thing about it is that even the selfish “1-percenters” have to put their money some-where besides under their mattress, which creates loanable funds or capital for the creation of jobs. 
When we try and raise investment taxes or create new 
taxes entirely, it encourages strange behavior that often does little to help the least of these. Let us not forget that 200 mil-lion Chinese were lifted from poverty by free-market capital-ism. If West and Smiley’s assertion that one in two Ameri-cans is in or near poverty is true, I suspect that a move to a true free-market system can do it just as well.

Sloppy reporting 
mars Paterno’s death
After an already tough few months for Pennsylvania State University, the community received some more bad news Sunday. Former head coach of Penn State’s 
football team Joe Paterno passed away at the age of 85. 
But in a terrible display of reporting gone wrong, news 
of Paterno’s death broke prematurely due to a misinformed tweet by a blogger, which was picked up by major online news sources like the Huffington Post and CBSSports.com.
The blogger who posted the false tweet was managing edi-
tor of Onwardstate.com, Devon Edwards. Onwardstate.com is an unofficial blog for Penn State, described by Editor-at-Large Davis Shaver as “a student-run community news web-site.” 
According to Shaver, two of the blog’s writers received 
news of an email, supposedly sent by “a high-ranking ath-letic official” to athletes at Penn State, claiming Paterno had passed. When Edwards received news of this email from one writer and confirmation from another, he tweeted the news. 
CBSSports.com also reported the news after the tweet 
was posted. Minutes later, Joe Paterno’s son Scott refuted the information, saying his father was still “alive but in serious condition.” 
Over the last few years, blogs have become a tour de force 
in terms of their influence on the media. The more credible blogs are often cited as legitimate sources in news reports. While some blogs simply provide commentary on the news of the day, others create original content by doing their own reporting and news-gathering. 
This trend in the melding of traditional and online media, 
while providing a new interactive environment between the media and the audience, can also have some serious conse-quences for the integrity of the news.
First, the blog should and has taken responsibility for their 
false reports on the situation. Edwards, the managing editor, immediately resigned after learning he had posted the incor-rect information. Unfortunately, the blog was on the bad end of a horrible hoax, but the bloggers still showed a great deal of accountability. 
What’s even more troubling about this issue is the com-
plete lack of journalistic integrity of the mainstream web-sites who jumped on the story. The reporters at CBSSports.com should have realized this was a delicate issue and tri-ple-checked the tweet before they published the story. As a professional news outlet that reaches millions of people, one would have thought their standards for news-gathering were top-notch. This oversight was just pure laziness. 
While blogs have a lot to offer the media and their audi-
ences, they are still not held to the same standards that pro-fessional news organizations have to uphold. Well, at least we thought they do.

Neighbors can be as annoying as cheapskates who sneak 
into churches to do laundry rather than go to a laun-dromat. I thought I’d escaped the worst when I moved 
out of the dorms — excuse me, “residence halls” — and into my apartment, but little did I know the horrors of off-campus neighbors.  
Upon moving in, I had my eardrums handed to me. Next 
door lived a guy who bumped the Jersey Shore soundtrack from 10 a.m. to 2 a.m.  Above me lived a rambunctious Latina step team.
At first, I tried not to worry . “Loud music guy will stop 
bumping club tunes once the semester starts,” I said to my-self, “and just because their wireless network is named ‘Mu-jerrrrrrr!’ doesn’t mean they’ll make bad neighbors.” Then I realized I was talking to myself and promptly told myself to shut up. 
As fall approached and the air chilled, so too did my at-
titude. The club music continued, starting precisely when the clock struck 10 a.m. The step routine practices became louder and more elaborate. Then one of the chicas began having loud sex. I hated the noise — all that noise, noise, noise! Then I got an idea. An awful idea. A wonderful, awful idea! 
What I present to you now is that idea, which is now my 
proven three-step method for dealing with annoying neigh-bors. I call it Fierce Aural Punish-ment, or “FAP” for short.
Step one: diplomacy . Approach 
your neighbors when they’re mak-ing too much noise and ask them to stop. They may just be oblivious. During one evening practice of the Chonga line, my roommate Patrick went upstairs and confronted them. Turns out they didn’t speak much 
English, so Patrick, who is from Miami, used his limited Span-ish to say, “Please silence your feet.” Since that time, no is-sues. 
The Jersey Boar and the loud sex, however, still remained.Step two: aural alerts. Use opportune music to manipulate 
neighbors into shutting up. No one wants to tell a couple their sex is too loud. That’s why — after one of the loud boinking sessions — I blasted Lonely Island’s “I Just Had Sex” to send a clear message. 
The club guy took a little more creativity .  His club tunes 
were all in 4/4 time, so I found some awful dubstep on Sound-cloud in 6/8 time, because that would jam his bass line and make a pile of awful sound. (Added plus: It sampled some Yoko Ono vocals.) I waited one morning for 10 a.m. to arrive, then blasted the dubstep the second his music started. He stopped. I stopped. He started again. I started again. I’ve yet to hear a club tune since.
Step three: collective action. If the first two steps fail, host 
a BYOB party — bring your own broom. I have not had to do this, but I heard about it from my friend Darien. To throw one, call your friends and tell them to bring brooms over to your place. Acquire a Costco-sized pack of earplugs. Once your friends arrive, pass out the earplugs, blast Lil Mama’s “Lip Gloss” on loop, and smack the ceiling with your brooms along to the beat. 
Disclaimer: Before proceeding with my plan (FAP-ing), 
make sure that all your neighbors’ annoying behavior is legal. If they’re making enough noise to be heard from the street, then report them to the police. Properly FAP-ing a neighbor who’s making an illegal amount of noise requires making the same amount, opening you up to fines. 
When dealing with crazy , don’t feel obligated to stay sane 
and rational. You cannot reason with crazy. You can only ma-nipulate crazy by confronting it with similar crazy . Don’t be tempted to care about your neighbors because you already know they don’t care about you. FAP-ing works. Just do it.

On Thursday it was announced that 
Rupert Murdoch and News Interna-tional have agreed to pay cash to the 
dozens of people — including Jude Law and Danii Minogue — who have been harassed and hacked by the titles in his corporation.
News Corp was famously thrown for a 
loop last summer. Once allegations of illegal activity arose, all the respect for the conglom-erate seemed to dissipate.
Surprisingly, Hugh Grant was one of the 
first to out the company by wiring himself and interviewing a “reporter,” where he caught him admitting that they hack phones, delete voicemails and set up illegal activity in order to get the scoop. Countless American celebrities complain about the paparazzi’s presence on their front lawns. British celebs, however, such as Sienna Miller and Jude Law have claimed British media is far worse.
When News Corp was indicted by Parlia-
ment, salacious claims came to light about its unethical practices. Widows of the Iraq war had their phones bugged while some report-ers could listen in on Prince William and Prince Harry’s personal cellphones.
Perhaps the worst claim was that of Milly 
Dowler, a 13-year-old girl who was abduct-ed and murdered in 2002. Reporters from News of the World apparently hacked into Dowl-
er’s phone after her disappearance and delet-ed voicemails, causing police and her family to think she was still alive.
It seems as if the 21st century has truly 
become an age of shock where anything will sell, and because of that, newspapers are willing to put in the extra illegal mile in order to obtain the best stories. Gone are the days where some modicum of privacy can be ex-pected.
Because of this all-or-nothing approach, 
we cannot watch a Lindsay Lohan film with-out seeing the girl sprawled across the tab-loids. When most of us see the new Leonardo DiCaprio film, instead of his performance, we wonder which Victoria’s Secret model he is dating.
Tabloid life and screen life have meshed 
together so inexplicably that it seems impos-sible to untangle. And because of that, the fu-ture of media is bound to look a little bleak.

Gainesville realtor Aaron Bosshardt 
announced Tuesday he plans to run for 
the Florida House of Representatives.
Bosshardt, a Democrat, hopes to 
represent District 22, which includes parts of Alachua and Marion counties. Elections are in November.
Republican Keith Perry currently 
holds the seat.
“I decided to run for the Florida 
House because I felt that we needed principled leadership and reasonable people in office that are able to address Florida’s future,” Bosshardt said.
Bosshardt is the president of 
Bosshardt Property Management LLC and is the Chief Operating Officer of Bosshardt Realty Services LLC.
He said he believes 
his skills as a small business owner will help him at the state 
level.
Bosshardt began his real estate ca-
reer in his late teens, said Jason Roth, spokesman for Bosshardt’s campaign. Bosshardt said he currently focuses on property management and managing real estate agents.
He said he believes his experience 
as a realtor will help him relate to citi-zens. 
Bosshardt said voters need to keep 
an eye on their state legislators, and he plans to stay accountable to his con-stituents.
“What [students] don’t need to do is 
let people in Tallahassee just look busy and make sure that they’re voting and holding their representatives account-able,” he said.Gainesville

  Rachael Pendleton’s alarm 
clock runs ﬁ  ve minutes fast so she’s never late. She 
plans her busy life down to the minute.
  But that doesn’t soften the 
5 a.m. wake-up call for ROTC physical training.
  It’s still dark outside, but 
Pendleton gets out of bed quick-ly . She throws on her gray Army shirt and high-waisted black shorts. She laces up her running shoes. A quick swipe of conceal-er hides the dark circles under her eyes from lack of sleep. A touch of mascara — waterproof, so it won’t run when she sweats. Off she goes.
  But Pendleton doesn’t com-
plain. It’s all part of the plan. 
  The 21-year-old UF junior is 
completing two years of ROTC training in one. She’s studying to help soldiers suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. She plans to contract, or commit, to serve for a designated amount of time with the Army . 
  On top of that, Pendleton 
works about 15 hours a week at the Gator Wesley Founda-tion and takes 17 credit hours of class.
  Until last semester, she was 
a UF psychology major intend-ing to be a clinical psychologist. When a friend recommended nursing, Pendleton thought the suggestion was “funny and wouldn’t ﬁ  t.”
  Despite her reservations, 
Pendleton went to see her advis-ers. She wanted to have as much one-on-one time with patients as possible. To her surprise, advisers said her goals aligned with those of a psychiatric nurse practitioner, something she’d never considered before. 
  As a psychiatric nurse, she 
could prescribe medications, de-velop treatment plans and inter-act with patients daily . 
  Pendleton knew she wanted 
to work with PTSD victims be-cause she could make a differ-ence.
  “So many veterans have 
PTSD that didn’t get the help they needed,” Pendleton said. “It ruins their lives and the con-nection with their families.”
  The number of soldiers re-
turning from combat is becom-ing so large that soon there won’t be enough nurses to treat them. The shortage, according to a report by the American As-sociation of State Colleges and Universities, could reach 800,000 by 2020.
  In addition, one in every ﬁ  ve 
veterans returning from Af-ghanistan or Iraq reports symp-toms of PTSD or major depres-sion, according to a 2008 study from the RAND Corp. About half of those 300,000 people have sought treatment.
  Pendleton wants to help.  When some soldiers return, 
they have nightmares and ﬂ  ashbacks that force them to constantly relive the war they thought they left behind.
  “You see a lot of soldiers 
come home, and they might come home in one piece,” Pend-leton said. “But if they’re not the same person, there’s still a prob-lem.”
  She had a choice: enter the 
Army after completing nursing and graduate school or join UF’s ROTC program, which allows students to train in military sci-ences for four years and serve after graduation. In return, the Army will help fund her educa-tion.
  “ROTC was the best choice,” 
Pendleton said. “They under-stand that I’m a student right now and work with me.”
  After discussing her options 
with UF Army recruiting ofﬁ  cer Lt. Col. Bob Quint, she joined ROTC last fall.
  Pendleton takes military 
science classes, attends 6 a.m. physical training sessions and goes to a weekly leadership lab. She learns small-unit tactics as part of the Raiders, which trains members to think quickly in dire situations.   She runs, sprints and does 
bear crawls and push-ups. She now knows how to throw a gre-nade, how to walk in formation and how to call for emergency evacuation of a casualty on the battleﬁ  eld.
  In August, it took Pendleton 
21 minutes to run two miles. Now, it takes her 16 minutes, 59 seconds.
  Pendleton adjusted well to 
the ROTC program, Quint said.
  “She loves it,” he said. “I see 
it in her eyes.”
  “It is a lot of work, even 
now,” Pendleton said. “But I don’t mind it because I know that it’s working toward some-thing that I know I’ll love doing and I’ll ﬁ  nd rewarding.”
  Pendleton expects to serve at 
least eight years in the Army.
  “The satisfaction of taking 
care of soldiers and their fami-lies attracts a special kind of nurse,” Quint said, adding that her compassion, perseverance and positive attitude will make her an “outstanding nurse.”
  “Rachael is a ‘Hooah’ kind 
of person,” Quint said, using an Army term that often describes a dedicated soldier.
  “Let’s-rock-’n’-roll-and-get-
it-goin’ is Rachael Pendleton.”

Forward Jennifer George (32) battles in the paint with Kentucky guards Amber Smith (24) and Bria Goss during the Gators 57-52 loss to the Wildcats in Lexington, Ky., on Sunday. Florida has lost three straight to Kentucky. 
�UF LOST 57-52 IN LEXINGTON ON SUNDAY.
JOE MORGAN
Alligator Staff Writer
 
Down by three points with six seconds to play, Florida 
had one final chance to tie.
On the in-bounds play, Ndidi Madu reared back and re-
leased a baseball pass across the court, and Jennifer George 
jumped to catch the lob.
So did multiple Kentucky defenders, resulting in a jump 
ball that went to UK.
“It’s a play we practice every day,” redshirt senior guard 
Jordan Jones said. “Unfortunately, they had the (possession) arrow. It’s something we practice every day and have a lot of confidence in.”
The Gators’ last miscue was one of many in a 57-52 loss to 
the No. 6 Wildcats in Lexington, Ky., on Sunday.
The stretch that sealed Florida’s fate against Kentucky 
began with 3:18 to play in the first half.
After an Azania Stewart jumper gave the Gators a 21-16 
lead, Florida went cold. UF scored just two points during the next 10 minutes, allowing a five-point advantage to turn into a 15-point deficit on a 22-2 UK run.
The scoring drought proved to be too much for the Gators 
to overcome.
“You can’t have those spells where you let a really good 
team create a lead, where you’ve got to scratch and crawl 
back,” Butler said.Florida falls short in another close game with No. 6 Kentucky

After watching his team squander a 
16-point, second-half lead against LSU, 
coach Billy Donovan wasn’t surprised UF let another Southeastern Conference team avoid a blowout — just disappointed.
The problems that led to the Gators 
struggling to put the Tigers away began during their bye week, well before Satur -
day’s 76-64 win.
“There’s a maturity level that goes into 
it sometimes, where you have two ways of looking at the week off — ‘Oh my gosh, we have to practice for a whole week be-fore we play again,’ or, ‘Wow, we got a chance to really get better. Let’s utilize this time,’” Donovan said.
Donovan said Florida was the former, 
the one that saved a single strong effort in practice for Friday — the day before play-ing LSU. And much like their scrimmages, the Gators had trouble maintaining their intensity against the Tigers this weekend. 
Florida’s full-court press was able 
to force 10 LSU turnovers en route to a 12-point halftime lead. Tigers head coach Trent Johnson said his team wasn’t pre-pared for the Gators’ almost constant pres-sure.
“The intensity of their defense, espe-
cially their full-court pressure made it hard 
for us to get in a rhythm 
on offense; the crowd also made it hard for us to come back,” LSU point guard Anthony Hickey said.
But poor shot se-
lection and mental mistakes on defense neutralized the Gators’ 
pressure after halftime. The Tigers escaped the final 20 minutes with just one turnover and improved their 39.3 shooting percent-age in the first half to 48.6 percent in the second.
“Give [LSU] credit, they continued to 
play hard, but we had about four or five possessions up 16 where we just caught it and shot it — even like, no pass just shot,” Donovan said. “And what it did was it    Gators lack killer instinct

Patric Young’s most impressive play 
from Saturday night can’t be found in the box score. 
After Will Yeguete was fouled during a 
dunk attempt, the ball clanged off the back iron and careened skyward. Young left his feet as the whistle blew, outstretched his right arm almost a full 90 degrees behind his head, snared the ball and tomahawked it forward, throwing home a monster slam worth precisely zero points.
His reward? A few cheers, a couple lack-
luster high fives and an opportunity to go back to work. 
For fans and the casual observer, that’s 
all they need to see of Young’s game. He has an NBA body, NBA athleticism and he can illicit more than his fair share of wows, so he’s clearly the man. 
Personally, I expect more. The funny part is, to a much lesser ex-
tent, Billy Donovan is looking at it the way the fans are. 
“Just his energy level, it shifts our team,” 
Donovan said. “We’ve got to get him where he’s playing, even if it’s three or four min-utes, at an incredible burst of energy be-cause when he does that it totally changes the complexion of our team. And I think that’s what happened when he got in the game (Saturday).”
After opening 
on the bench due to an ankle injury, Young checked in at the 16:33 mark, with the Gators down 10-4. His first seven possessions 
were a work of art. 
A textbook box out on the defensive 
end was followed by a seal, post move and basket on his first offensive possession. He forced a turnover by contesting a pass to LSU’s Justin Hamilton. Then he got the ball in the post, gave a couple shoulder fakes and connected on a right-handed hook shot. 
Less than a minute later he hit a layup on 
an assist from Brad Beal. At the other end, he jostled Hamilton out of the lane, forcing him to catch the ball a good five feet from the paint. Trying to make up for lost space, Hamilton traveled, and Young had caused his second turnover. 
The game was tied, Florida had the ball, 
and the Gators never again trailed by more than two. Young’s highlight moments 
outshine actual production

For the second straight home game, 
Florida allowed an SEC team to go on a long scoring run in the final 20 minutes to steer clear of an embarrassing loss. Eleven days before LSU’s 16-8 streak, Georgia outscored the Gators 16-4 in a second-half span.
While Florida would go on to dou-
ble-digit victories in both games, Dono-van said the next six weeks of SEC play look daunting after his team’s most re-cent performance. After opening their league slate with four unranked oppo-nents, the Gators will face two ranked teams in their next five games.“As of right now, we’re 15-4; that’s 
not a bad record,” senior guard Erving Walker said. “But I mean, it’s only go-ing to get tougher from here. We got to continue to work hard.”
Though the Gators seemingly broke 
their own momentum against the Ti-gers, Donovan blamed his players’ lack of concentration in the second half, and during practice, on human nature. 
“We have to have a better under -
standing basketball IQ-wise when you’re up 16 how to handle the next three or four minutes,” Donovan said. “And I thought we played in a way that enabled them to get back in the game because we gave them opportu-nities to do what they do well.”

Florida coach Billy Donovan said his team didn’t utilize the bye week to 
improve in practice leading up to Saturday’s game against LSU. 
HOOPS,  from page 13Gators allowing late runsUF’s 23 turnovers prove costly
In Florida’s 59-56 home loss to Kentucky on 
New Year’s Day, the Gators went into halftime 
trailing the Wildcats 33-29. UF found itself in a similar situation on Sunday, tied with UK 21-21 after the first 20 minutes of play.
Florida could have easily held an advantage 
had it not been for its inefficiency from the char -
ity stripe. The Gators were 1 of 6 on free-throw shooting in the first half.
“It was the difference in the game,” Jones 
said. “That’s the difference in more momentum going into halftime, so it’s definitely something that cost us the game.”
Jones led Florida’s offense with 13 points, 
but a 1-of-6 clip from 3-point range marred her scoring effort. Jaterra Bonds and Jennifer George also scored in double digits, putting up 10 points each.
Despite their spotty offense, the Gators 
stayed in the game thanks to a solid defensive showing.
Florida limited Kentucky to 30 percent shoot-
ing, including an 18.8 percent mark from beyond the arc, and forced 17 Wildcat turnovers.
Particularly impressive was UF’s defense on 
UK’s leading scorer A’dia Mathies (15.3 points per game), who finished with just two points on 1-of-7 shooting.
“(Mathies) is the best player in the conference 
right now and we wanted to limit her touches,” 
Butler said.
The Gators had 23 give-
aways, which helped lead to their fourth loss in six SEC games decided by six points or fewer.
While Madu’s errant 
heave was the most glaring error for Florida, it was just one of many for a UF squad 
that continues to have difficulties taking care of the ball.
“You can’t give it back to them 23 times and 
expect to win a close game,” Butler said. 
“This is the best team in our conference so 
far and we’ve played them to possession ball games two times now and really had things in our hands and turned it over to them.”
Contact Joe Morgan at joemorgan@alligator.org.W-HOOPS , from page 13
“But, if you notice,” Don-
ovan said, “there are times 
where you don’t notice he’s even out there.”
Young checked in with 
4:23 remaining in the first half, some time passed, he picked up a foul with 1:28 left and checked out. That’s it. 
It was a solid game for 
Young overall — eight points on 3 of 3 shooting plus seven rebounds and a block in 24 minutes — but it was not without its poor stretches. 
With about 16 minutes left 
in the second half, there was a sequence where he missed a rebound, tapped another out of bounds and then gave up an easy layup when he failed to secure a loose ball. 
Whether the ups and downs 
are due to fatigue, as Dono-van suggests, or the lingering tendinitis, or something else entirely, the result has been mostly mediocre play during the course of Young’s career. 
For a player with Young’s 
tools, more should be expect-ed. 
He’s pulling in not-quite-7 
rebounds per game, and the advanced statistics don’t look great. Both his offensive and defensive rebounding percent-ages — the percent of avail-able boards he pulls in when he’s on the floor, compiled by kenpom.com — are lower than Will Yeguete’s. Young ranks 222nd nationally offen-sively and 271st defensively. 
His offensive game has im-
proved since last year, and he actually has post moves now. He’s averaging 11 points per contest and is shooting 63.5 percent, all while avoiding the foul bugaboo. He’s been whistled just 3.8 times per 40 minutes this season. 
And, naturally, the high-
light reel blocks are still there. Twenty-one of them. Not a dominant total, but solid nonetheless. 
Add it all up and you’ve got a pretty good big man on paper. 
And as he showed with 
Saturday night’s post-whistle jam, he doesn’t always need to make a huge dent in the box score to affect the game. 
But Young is supposed to 
be better than “pretty good,” and there’s no reason he shouldn’t be producing at an All-America, or at least All-SEC, level.  
“When he keeps running 
on a consistent basis,” Dono-van said, “you can’t help but notice him.”
Notice him. You never hear 
people say that dominant big men, like Ohio State’s Jared Sullinger, get “noticed,” or are important because of their “energy.”
So is that enough from the 
player some called the best big man Donovan has ever recruited? The next Dwight Howard? 
I’m not so sure.Contact Greg Luca at gluca@

While Hunter Joyer might be the Florida 
football team’s future at the fullback posi-
tion, on Sunday the freshman put his throw-ing skills on display.
In his debut for the UF men’s indoor track 
and field team, Joyer finished fifth in the shot put with a throw of 14.67m/48-01.75 at the Gator Invite.
Joyer, who won state championships at 
Tampa Catholic High his junior and senior year in the shot put, said that competing in track will help improve his strength and all-around athleticism.
“Track kind of helps out with football 
with explosion,” Joyer said. “They are really not too far apart.”
The invitational, which was held in the 
O’Connell Center, showcased 26 men and 13 women from Florida and a host of athletes from other in-state schools like FAU, UNF, UCF, Florida A&M and Bethune-Cookman.
Though a limited number of UF up-
perclassmen competed in their respective events, the meet’s main purpose was to accli-mate some of the younger athletes, like Joy-er, to the atmosphere of NCAA-sanctioned events.
“I just got settled in this year and I’m just trying to get a feel for everything,” Joyer said. “Next year I think I can really cut loose.”
One older field athlete who rose beyond 
the competition was junior thrower Jeremy Postin, who set a personal best and a new school record in the men’s weight throw with a distance of 21.31m/69-11.0. 
Overall, the No. 1 men’s team and un-
ranked women notched six individual wins, including three on throwing events, at the single-day meet.
“I think [Sunday] begins with Jeremy,” 
coach Mike Holloway said. “Talking with coach (Steve) Lemke, we kind of expected (that performance). Coach Lemke thinks there’s even more in the tank.” 
Postin’s success in the weight throw 
would be matched in the men’s shot put by teammate Stipe Zunic. A sophomore from Zadar, Croatia, Zunic sent his winning toss 16.40m/53-9.75 to claim first.
On the women’s side, Keely Medeiros 
also won a shot put title in the meet. Fellow senior Fidela James followed closely behind with a second-place toss, also taking a vic-tory in the weight throw behind a toss of 19.11m/62-8.50.
“The big thing for me is I want to see a 
continual effort and keep building on what we’ve done so far,” Holloway said. “If you look at what we’ve done every year in the past, we get just a little bit better each week. Because of that, we always have great perfor -
mances at conference and nationals and we don’t want to change that at all.”

RECRUITING
KELLY PRICE
Alligator Writer
 
Will Muschamp doesn’t come 
off as a warm and fuzzy guy.
So defensive end Bryan Cox, Jr., 
was a bit taken aback when the Flor -
ida head coach embraced him after 
the three-star recruit announced his commitment before a dinner Satur -
day night.
“He just like gave me a really 
big hug and said ‘Welcome to the family,’” Cox said. “It felt great… I never got a hug like that before in my life.
“It was just great to know that he 
was excited and I was excited.”
Cox, who brings Muschamp’s 
first full class to 19, had offers from Miami, North Carolina, Michigan State, Louisville and others.
“I just made my own choice,” 
he said. “I just get a really good vibe from (the coaching staff).... I get great vibes from the Gator Na-tion. All the fans and the players are great.”
Cox joins a 2012 class stacked on 
the defensive line with five commit-ments and one already signed.
“We’re going to have a lot more 
options with what coach can do with us and different packages and whatnot,” he said. “It’s going to be interesting.”
The coaching staff told Cox he 
will start off at the Buck linebacker position with a switch to defensive end possible if he bulks up.
Cox gave his oral commitment 
during a big weekend for recruiting at Florida, which hosted four five-star prospects, seven uncommitted athletes and four oral commits.
The Gators also picked up a 
prospect in an area of need in 2013 running back Adam Lane from Winter Haven, who committed on Saturday during an unofficial visit. The 5-foot-7, 207-pound back is the first commit of the 2013 class. 
Also, uncommitted prospect 
Alex McCalister, a three-star end from Clemmons, N.C., will choose between Florida, Georgia Tech and North Carolina on Monday.
“He’s really lengthy and a rang-
ey kind of guy,” Cox said of McCal-ister. “Put some weight on him and he’ll be a really good player.”
According to Cox, McCalis-
ter had a good time in Gainesville and has the Gators at the top of his board.“I think he enjoyed it really 
well,” Cox said. “He was one of the guys I went out with. … We had a good time.”
McCalister had been set to visit 
last weekend, but had to cancel due to an illness in his family. He moved his decision date from last week to this Monday.
Florida has made a late push for 
McCalister, another promising de-fensive prospect noted for his ability to disrupt defenses and pursuit of the ball carrier. McCalister has also been told by the Florida coaching staff that he would play at the Buck linebacker position in Gainesville.
Other official visitors this week-
end included oral commits Matt Jones, Colin Thompson, JaFar Mann and Brian Poole.
Five-star wide receiver Stefon Diggs, five-star cornerback Tracy Howard and five-star defensive end and FSU oral commit Dante Fowler, Jr., were also on official visits in Gainesville this weekend. 
Three-star quarterback Skyler 
Mornhinweg, who is orally com-mitted to Penn State, also visited.
Since the hiring of new offensive 
coordinator Brent Pease, Diggs and Agholor seem to be leaning toward Florida, but both will most likely make decisions on or around Sign-ing Day on Feb. 1.
Diggs posted on Twitter Satur -
day night: “I love it. Love the en-vironment and just the thought of being a gator.” 
Oral commitments are nonbinding 
until a national letter of intent is signed on or after National Signing Day on Feb. 1.

�UF SWEPT DOUBLES, WON 6-1.
STAFF REPORT
 
Far away from the friendly confines of 
Linder Stadium, the No. 8 Florida men’s ten-
nis team  opened its dual match season on Sunday in Waco, Texas, with a convincing 6-1 win over No. 5 Baylor. 
Following up on last year’s victory against 
the Bears (1-1), the Gators (1-0) put on a simi-larly impressive performance, taking the doubles point and winning five of the six singles points.
To open the afternoon, all three of Flori-
da’s doubles teams defeated their opponents. The No. 4 team of Nassim Slilam and Billy Federhofer defeated Marko Krickovic and Robert Verzaal 8-5. The doubles teams of No. 41 Spencer Newman and Frank Carleton and No. 25 Bob van Overbeek also won their matches by scores of 8-6 and 8-5, respective-ly. 
Junior Billy Federhofer turned in the most 
dominant singles performance of the after -
noon, dismantling Baylor’s Kike Grangeiro 6-0, 6-1. 
Federhofer’s doubles partner Nassim Slil-
am also won his match, tak-ing both highly-contested sets with Diego Galeano, 6-3, 7-5.   
The lone blemish for 
Florida occurred when Bob van Overbeek dropped his 
singles match to No. 20 Mate Zsiga 6-4, 6-2. The Hungarian-born Zsiga was 
dominant in his win over the Gators’ junior, who came into the match ranked 69th in the nation. That loss brought the score to 2-1 in Florida’s favor. 
It was Florent Diep, a French sophomore, 
who clinched the match for the Gators. His 7-5, 7-5 victory over the Bears’ Marko Krick-ovic made it 4-1 Florida. 
Frank Carleton, a junior transfer from 
Wake Forest, overcame a poor first set by de-feating Baylor’s No. 54 Roberto Maytin 1-6, 6-3, 6-4. 
The afternoon concluded with No. 84 
Spencer Newman defeating Baylor freshman No. 52 Lars Behlen 6-1, 6-7 (3), 1-0 (10-7). That clinched the 6-1 victory for the Gators.
