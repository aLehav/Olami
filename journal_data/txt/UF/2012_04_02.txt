RESOURCE SERVICES FROM MULTIPLE   
COLLEGES.

On its second day of meetings at Lake Wauburg, 
the UF Board of Trustees discussed cutting more costs, 
including merging administrative and human resource services among colleges.
General obligation bonds were mentioned as a po-
tential way to make up the $15-million infrastructure deﬁ  cit previously ﬁ  lled with Public Education Capital Outlay money.
“It’s likely that PECO funds will not be replaced in the 
near future,” UF Trustee David Brown said. “We can’t miss this opportunity from a ﬁ  nancial standpoint.”

James Perez had no idea it was a former Gators basket-
ball player who was arrested for stealing a $3 taco from his 
downtown food stand early Friday morning.
Then the forwarded messages came pouring in.
When Perez took a closer look at his phone later in the 
day, each new text or email from one of his friends led to a story saying the 5-foot-8, 178-pound man he chased across three blocks was Erving Walker — UF’s all-time leader in assists and the lone senior on this year’s team.
Walker was arrested by Gainesville Police Department ofﬁ  cers at about 1 a.m. Friday and charged with petit theft 
and resisting an ofﬁ  cer without violence, both misdemean-
ors. He was not jailed and is scheduled to 
appear in court on April 19 at 9 a.m.
“I don’t follow sports,” Perez said. “He 
was just some dude that stole who was 
very fast.”
According to Perez, Walker stopped 
at the Tacos Locos food stand across from Rockey’s Piano Bar on South Main Street 
just before 1 a.m. and placed an order.
As Perez, 26, prepared to receive pay-
ment like he has every day since setting up his stand last June, his co-worker Matt Hruska, also 26, quickly prepared a taco and gave it to Walker.
“He ordered a $3 sausage taco and then he was like, ‘Do 
ya’ll take cards?’” Perez said.
But before either Perez or Hruska could reply, Walker 
allegedly took off with the taco and sprinted across Main 
Street toward Southwest First Avenue.
“So I looked at Matt and said, ‘Dang, he just stole that. 
Should I chase him?’ and he was like, ‘Yeah,’” Perez said.
Perez said two other tall men accompanied Walker to the 
stand, but neither tried to stop what was happening and be-gan to slowly walk behind him as Walker ran.Vendor provides account of Walker’s alleged taco theftSEE TRUSTEES, PAGE 5

A UF student who was hit by a semitrailer 
last week remained in critical condition at 
Shands at UF on Sunday.
Omair Usmani, 19, of Orlando, ran in front of trafﬁ  c at the 3300 block of Williston Road around 4 p.m. Wednesday. The driver of the semitrailer, which was heading west, could not swerve away from Usmani in time, 
according to police.
Sey Hee Park, a microbiology and cell 
science senior, said he was stuck in trafﬁ  c Wednesday afternoon because Williston Road 
was shut down. All he saw was one semitrail-er and metal shards on the pavement.
Park, who is friends with Usmani, as-
sumed the semitrailer hit another vehicle. Until Sunday, he did not know Usmani was involved.   Usmani’s friends have ﬂ  ooded his Face-
book the last four days, many of them writ-ing that they just heard the news. Some wrote encouragements, and others said they were praying for Usmani, who graduated from 
Seminole High School in 2010.
“Salaam man,” one friend wrote. “I’m 
praying for you … hang in there … I love you 
bro.”

April 4, 1986: Three students criticize the UF 
judicial system in front of a committee, saying 
Assistant Student Affairs Dean Mike Rollo, who heads the committee, has too much power. “Stu-dents are afraid to come out and say anything against him,” said Student Body President Earl Ziebarth. “They’re afraid he’ll fry them.”
April 2, 1990: A native South African speaks 
at a forum in Turlington Hall and says apart-heid will eventually be destroyed by economic malaise. Brett Field, who attends Rollins College and is in the U.S. on scholarship, said the South African government spends four times as much on whites as it does blacks, and the system “has burned itself out.”
April 5, 1994: UF students are encouraged to 
enter Care Free gum’s Total Yodel contest, which it is hosting to promote its new Alpine Mint fla-vor. To enter, applicants need only call a 1-800 number and leave their name, address and give their best yodel. Winners will get a six-day trip to Switzerland.

The last day of classes is a few weeks away , and planning 
for dorm and apartment move-out is in full swing.
Residence halls will close May 5. The 7,700 students who 
live on campus must move out by then, said IRHA president 
Severin Walstad. 
Walstad encouraged students to attend the final residence 
hall floor meeting, where resident assistants will go over 
checkout procedures. Students must make check-out ap-pointments with their resident assistants at least 24 hours in advance to avoid any charges.
Jordan Speisman, owner of UF Mover Guys, said his com-
pany specializes in full-service moving, including packing and unpacking. Speisman said UF Mover Guys is usually 
busiest at the end of semesters and during summer.
Victoria Bryer, an 18-year-old interior design freshman, 
said she will be heading home to South Florida for the sum-
mer. She said she’ll probably use a moving service when she moves out of her residence hall.
“My parents and I would definitely appreciate any extra 
help,” Bryer said. “The more hands, the better.”
Speisman said the average cost of his company’s moving 
services is between $180 and $260. Students can get a price quote by contacting UF Mover Guys by phone or email.
Out-of-state UF students may choose to use storage ser -
vices in Gainesville over the summer.   
Tanya Durst, an 18-year-old English freshman from Palm 
Desert, Calif., said she plans to store her belongings at a friend’s house or at a storage facility.
Sharon McLaughlin, resident manager at A-1 Mini Stor -
age, said the most popular storage unit for students, 5 feet by 10 feet, costs $47 per month, McLaughlin said.
She said A-1’s storage units will fill up during April or 
May. She recommends coming to the office to reserve a unit.Moving companies ready for end of semester

U.S. Marshals located and arrested a 
50-year-old alleged child sodomist Sun-
day in north Gainesville.
The U.S. Marshals Florida Regional 
Fugitive Task Force jailed Thomas Fin-ley on an outstanding warrant for the rape and sodomy of a 10-year-old girl in Alabama, according to a news re-
lease.
The warrant was issued March 12, 
but Finley , a former Gainesville resident, 
left Alabama. He traveled throughout Florida, staying briefly at different mo-tels and using different modes of trans-portation between them.
Earlier this week, 
task force members started surveil-
lance at locations in 
Gainesville where Finley used to spend time, according to 
the release. They 
learned that Finley could be coming 
back through Gainesville soon.
At 11:45 a.m. Sunday , task force members watched Finley get dropped off at a house near the 3000 block of North Main Street. Investigators from the Gainesville Police Department, Levy County Sheriff’s Office and Ala-chua County Sheriff’s Office met close 
by, according to the release.
With help from an Alachua Coun-
ty K-9 unit, task force members sur -
rounded the house and ordered Finley to come out. He was arrested without 
incident and booked into the Alachua County Jail.

Matt Michel didn’t set out to make a name for himself. 
Breaking a national record — twice — was never the goal.
On Sunday in the Stephen C. O’Connell Center, he became 
the longest-running Dance Marathon charity participant in the 
country, two times over. Out of thousands of dancers at more 
than 150 schools nationwide that raise money for Children’s 
Miracle Network Hospitals through DM, Michel is the only one who has made it to nine years at the annual event, smash-ing his previous record of eight years in 2011.
On Saturday and Sunday , he and 810 other dancers stood 
for 26.2 hours straight. They learned the annual line dance, fist-pumped in a silent disco and played Quidditch with hula hoops. Every few hours, they listened to patients’ families talk about how their children benefited from care funded by DM.
Michel said the stories make the event meaningful and 
keep him coming back.
“That’s what makes it different than, say , beach cleanup,” 
he said.
But when Michel, 27, signed up for DM for the first time 
with his fraternity pledge class, he didn’t know much beyond a video he saw of the group line dance. It seemed fun, and he’d be with friends — why not?
Now, he is a veteran dancer, with favorite line dances and 
favorite moves. The dance to Journey’s “Any Way You Want It” is one of his favorites, and he prefers high-energy dances with transitions between song clips.
He has enough DM experience to have planned outfit 
changes, supportive shoes and a study spot near an outlet. He wore orange-and-blue plaid board shorts — board shorts are comfortable, and bright colors keep him alert. The shorts also match his Cheeto-orange hair.
He has raised $300 to $400 each year for a total of about 
$3,000 since his first year dancing. He wants to keep donating, and he hopes to visit DM after he graduates. The participants and organizers from Michel’s undergraduate days are already at that stage.
Michel might not know some of the younger crowd, but 
the older participants and staff members still stop to shake his hand or slap a high five every 30 seconds. A four-year dancer who is also Michel’s fraternity great-great-great-great-grand-little brother stopped to chat. Then two friends brought him a 
smoothie, and when they left, a staff member asked how he’s 
holding up.
Kenny Brighton, the overall director of DM at UF in 2010 
and 2011, used to be one of those people. He said Michel’s been dancing in DM so long that he was allowed to use private rooms reserved for staff members, which is how they met.
Now he can’t imagine DM without Michel.Staff members check months ahead to see who has signed 
up, and seeing Michel’s name on the list helps the staff feel like they will be able to pull off a successful event.
“We all know everything’s going to be right with the world 
after that,” Brighton joked.
He’s usually visible at the event, but in hours 23 and 24, 
Michel sticks out for more than his height and his hair.
“People are dragging a little bit,” Brighton said. “But Matt 
Michel is always excited, always contagious.”
That reputation has lasted, even when Michel should not 
have been standing at all. In 2009, his ankle was double its usual size, iced and wrapped in bandages. He completed the 26.2 hours on crutches.
“That was the first year I didn’t dance at all,” he said. “I just 
stood — and very often leaned.” He rolled his ankle when he fell off a rock-climbing wall, and he stayed off his foot as much as possible so he could still participate in DM. He won the Jen 
Krug award that year for the most outstanding dancer. It was 
his sixth year, which tied the school record.
Michel said nobody was really sure what the national re-
cord was, but people started wondering around his seventh year of Dance Marathon. National representatives confirmed that eight years in a row was a record.
Now he has one year left at UF before he moves to South 
Florida, where he hopes to practice immigration law. He’s been at UF for almost a decade earning bachelor’s degrees in Span-
ish and history, master’s degrees in international business and 
history, his law degree and doctorate degree in Spanish.
Cecily Welsh, a third-year law student who has worked 
with Michel on the UF Supreme Court, said Michel applies his DM commitment to every area of his life.
He asks thoughtful, pointed questions in his law classes, 
teaches an undergraduate Spanish course, is a member of Florida Blue Key , has worked in all three branches of Student Government and still goes out of his way to get to know his 
peers, she said.
“He’s involved with 16 times more things than you’re do-
ing,” she said, laughing.
As Michel approaches the end of his college career, he has 
to decide whether he will participate in his usual activities and 
whether he will go for a decade of DM.
Michel sealed his nine-year record when he sat down at 1:42 
p.m. on Sunday . But as he marked the end of DM, he knew it might be for the last time.

A Cafe Risque patron asked a stripper named Angel to 
come back to his hotel Thursday night. She brought three 
people with her, and those people brought weapons.
Jonathan D. Mieras, 45, of Wellborn, was robbed, threat-
ened with a shotgun and shocked with a stun gun, accord-ing to the Alachua County Sheriff’s Office.
The suspects — Candace L. Allen, 27; Michael C. Angelo, 
26; Adrene L. Foreman, 20; and Michael S. Williams, 20 — were charged with kidnapping, home invasion with a fire-arm and two counts of grand theft.
A Sheriff’s Office arrest report gave this account:  Allen, whose stage name is Angel, made plans with Mi-
eras on Thursday afternoon while she was working at Cafe Risque, a Micanopy strip club famous for its red-and-yellow “We Bare All” billboards. The two had never met before Thursday, Mieras said, but Allen told him she would swing by his hotel room after she got off work.
She arrived at Room 224 at the Micanopy Inn at about 
10 p.m. Thursday but soon walked away, telling Mieras she 
would be back in a minute. She left the door open. Then, Angelo, Foreman and Williams walked into the room.
Angelo carried a black shotgun. He told 
Mieras to get on the floor. He told him he might kill him.
When Mieras tried to wrestle the shot-
gun from Angelo, one of the other two al-leged robbers shocked Mieras with a stun 
gun. Mieras said he was shocked between 12 and 14 times, and his head is bruised from getting hit by the butt of the shotgun.The three suspected robbers then tied him up with ripped 
towels and stole a duffle bag, a wallet, an electric razor, a credit card, three months’ worth of pain-relief pills, an iP-hone 4, $1,500 and a Tec-9 pistol with 12 bullets.
“I’m very embarrassed,” Mieras said.After talking with other Cafe Risque employees, Sheriff’s 
Office detectives found out that Allen was living at the Mo-tel 6 on Southwest 40th Boulevard in Gainesville. Detectives went there and arrested Allen, Angelo and Williams.
While deputies searched the hotel room for evidence — 
they found a shotgun next to one of the beds — Foreman showed up. They arrested her, too.
All four suspects remained at the Alachua County Jail on 
bail ranging from $60,000 (Foreman) to about $1.3 million (Angelo). The general manager of Cafe Risque said Sunday that Allen was “absolutely not” working at the strip club anymore.
“It was quite a scuffle,” Mieras said Sunday afternoon. “I 
lost the battle, but they lost the war.”

This year, DM at UF also set a record and raised 
$886,726.15 through donations made before and during 
the event itself. The previous school record, set in 2011, was about $713,000. Students raise money by asking friends and family for donations to Children’s Miracle Net-work Hospitals made through dancers’ accounts.
Donations to DM at UF fund research and amenities such 
as parking, computers and car seats for Shands Hospital for Children patients and their families.

MONDAY FEATUREtures by $100 million over the past five years, said 
UF Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Matt Fajack, but costs are rising. He said UF has fought this by not giving raises, deferring maintenance on campus and combining departments.
Fajack suggested transitioning to shared ser -
vice centers, a place where multiple colleges at UF could share resources such as human resource ser -
vices, financial planning and tech assistance.
A large college at UF could have one service 
center, but smaller colleges could share one, he said.
“It is going to cause some angst on campus,” 
Fajack said. “Although I think three years, four 
years down the road, faculty will be happy.”
He said UF would try to avoid losing key em-
ployees and disrupting services.
Provost Joe Glover presented an update on 
STEM education, mentioning two bills that could 
change curriculum for UF students.
House Bill 7135 would reduce the required gen-
eral education coursework from 36 credit hours to 30 that must be completed in communication, 
mathematics, social sciences, humanities and natu-
ral sciences. The bill is an attempt to standardize education across Florida’s public universities, Glover said.
House Bill 7129 would require nine to 12 credits 
that must be taken on-campus at UF.
Glover said he wants each freshman class to 
have a signature UF experience. What Is the Good 
Life?, an interdisciplinary class that examines what 
it means to lead a good life from a variety of per -
spectives, is being treated as the prototype.
Machen said UF is still committed to serving 
Florida by admitting mostly in-state students.
The board examined results 
from last year’s Student Experi-ence in the Research University 
survey.
Although UF students study 
less than their peers at other 
schools, according to the sur -
vey’s results, 74 percent of UF 
students feel like they belong on UF’s campus and 77 percent of UF students would choose to enroll again.
To that, Trustee Charles Edwards said, “Some-
body’s doing something right.”

he was being followed he tripped and fell, dropping the taco in the process, before heading into a park-
ing lot next to Loosey’s bar at the 
corner of Southwest First Avenue 
and Southwest Second Street.
“Then he ran over there and 
stopped for a second and he was like, ‘Don’t come at me, man,’” 
Perez said. “And I was like, ‘I’m not coming at you, I’m going to get a cop and you’re going to jail.’”
Perez said he flagged down a po-
lice officer in a patrol car before con-
tinuing to run after Walker. When 
Walker saw Perez talking to police, 
he ran across West University Av-
enue and continued north on North-
west First Street, Perez said.
According to the arrest report, GPD officer Visvambhara Nicoloff 
chased Walker on foot and yelled “Police! Stop!” at Walker, who 
looked back before turning around 
to get back onto West University 
Avenue.
With the help of several marked 
police cars, Nicoloff caught up to 
Walker and arrested him in the 200 
block of West University Avenue.
Walker told police he knew he 
had not paid for the taco when he 
initially ran off and that he was “just 
playing around.”
“Then, finally, the cops tackled 
him and arrested him,” Perez said. 
“And he looked at me and said, 
‘Come on man, for $3?’ — like I 
screwed him.”

“Anchorman” sequel? Poll Problems
Americans conflicted 
about protection laws 
A new poll by Harris Interactive/HealthDay presents 
some pretty troubling findings.
The poll dealt with the public’s opinion of laws de-
signed to either protect individuals from hurting one another or laws aimed at protecting individuals from hurting them-
selves.
In terms of laws that fall under the first category, 91 percent 
supported “banning texting while driving,” 86 percent sup-
ported “requiring the vaccination of young children against mumps, measles, whooping cough, TB, polio and other dis-eases,” and 80 percent supported “banning smoking in restau-rants and other enclosed public spaces.”
For the proposals mentioned above, it can certainly be ar -
gued that banning or regulating these behaviors can protect 
public safety. Although, the proposed ban of smoking in res-
taurants might confuse respondents because it does not say who does the banning — the government or the restaurant itself.
Clearly, though, by these results, respondents believe the 
government should play a large part in protecting us from do-ing things that might hurt others.
When respondents were given the statement, “People 
should take personal responsibility for their own actions and 
be free to make their own decisions, even if they suffer as a 
result,” 81 percent either strongly or somewhat agreed with the statement.
So, when given the option to ban or regulate actions that 
would prevent individuals from hurting themselves and not other people, one would expect that respondents would over -
whelmingly disagree with those proposals.
Surprisingly, however, that did not occur.Eighty-six percent of respondents supported laws “requir -
ing drivers and passengers in the front seats to wear seatbelts;” 82 percent supported laws “requiring motorcycle riders to wear helmets;” 73 percent supported “requiring bicyclists to wear helmets;” 68 percent supported “regulations to reduce salt in packaged foods;” and 62 percent supported “banning the use of trans fats in restaurants.”
Obviously, not wearing a helmet or a seatbelt only puts 
your life in danger, but the same respondents who said we should take personal responsibility for our own actions and 
suffer the consequences if they make bad decisions believe the 
government should stop us from making bad decisions.
Do these people have multiple personality disorder, or 
were the questions just extremely confusing? Or are most Americans simply unsure of what they really believe?
Sixty-one percent of respondents believed that laws like the 
ones mentioned above were “turning us into a ‘nanny state.’”
So even though they believe those laws are turning us into 
a nanny state, a clear majority of respondents to this survey 
support those laws.
The American people are clearly confused on seemingly 
simple issues. Imagine their contradictory thoughts on health 
care.
Cheating is the sign of a flawed system
Preamble: I am not in favor of lies, deceit and dishon-
esty. I am merely here to explain why I think cheating is more than what your professors would like to have 
you think, and in which circumstances I find it understand-able.
Let me start with a story. I once had a civics teacher who 
taught me about the separation of powers and the system of checks and balances. One day, this same civics teacher pun-ished my friend John, whom he saw copying the definition of due process from my worksheet rather than the book, giving us both an F on the assignment.
Back then, I was a precocious brat who liked giving au-
thority figures a hard time. (Now I’ve found that’s called being a journalist.) Our teacher began to lecture us on the immorality of cheating and how I was just as bad as he was for letting him copy my definition and try to pass my work off as his own.
I rolled my eyes and said, “Sir, I copied that definition 
from the book like we’re supposed to. Whether John copied it from the book or my paper, his answer and methodology were going to be the same. How is that any less valid than what I did?”
“He didn’t follow the directions of the assignment,” said 
my teacher.
“Right, but how is that cheating? I do not understand 
how the source of his answer — given that it wasn’t sup-posed to be him — makes it cheating. And even further, you punished us without due process, exercising your unilateral power over our grades based on your judgment alone. That hardly seems like something the Founding Fathers would approve of.”
I got sent to the principal for that. My perception of the 
classroom had been shattered. It was no longer a place for learning; instead, it was a dictatorship where the professor assumes the role of plaintiff, judge and jury. I no longer be-lieved the education system to be objective.
Teachers have always been telling me just how immoral plagiarism and cheating are, and yet their tests contain questions without verbs or their essay topics are overly broad.
For instance, my sophomore 
English teacher assigned me an essay on “how to end stereo-types.” Doing that assignment ad-equately would win you a Nobel Peace Prize.
No teacher listened whenever I’d voice my concerns, no 
matter how obnoxiously I did so. Teachers often believe in their tests more than they believe in you, and there’s nothing you can do to challenge them.
When I got to college, this problem only got worse. I 
watched professors of weed-out classes ignore legitimate concerns of students to maintain the proper bell curve need-ed to deflect any accusations of grade inflation. When these professors didn’t address students’ concerns, the students had nowhere else to turn.
In a system where justice comes from a biased person 
who has stakes in the judgment and who has no incentive to be fair, I think cheating offers the only way for students to empower themselves. This is not to say that I advocate cheat-ing (or that I cheat myself), but without cheating, students can only watch their grades go down when professors do un-fair things — such as telling students certain material won’t be on the test and then test you on it or assigning essay topics students aren’t able to adequately tackle.
In most circumstances, cheating is wrong. But until there is 
a method to hold professors accountable for unfair practices, I think cheating can be a justifiable equalizer of power in the classroom. Not that it matters because professors will simply disregard the point without giving it a second thought and fail cheaters under the guise of moral superiority.

Letters to the Editor
Students should protest for the 
Syrian people
Edmund Burke, an 18th-cen-
tury Irish political theorist, once 
said, “All that is necessary for the 
triumph of evil is that good men 
do nothing.”
True to this concept, the vio-
lent triumph of Bashar al-Assad, 
the current president of Syria, has 
resulted in the deaths of thou-sands of innocent civilians (in-cluding countless young children, pregnant women and courageous 
journalists) in a bloodbath un-
precedented in modern Middle Eastern history.
And what have the good men 
done? Other than sharing al-Jazeera videos on Facebook, noth-ing.
The obvious question arises: 
What can we do? After all, I have barely any money in my bank ac-
count (there goes the chance to 
donate to aid Syrian refugees) and even less (i.e. zero) political lever-age to inﬂ  uence American foreign policy in the Middle East.
The answer is bitter but a time-
tested one: Get yourself out on the streets.
Change, from the time when the 
American revolutionaries “ﬂ  ash-mobbed” King Street in Boston in 1770 until today, has only come when our political and civic lead-ers realize that our emotions have 
transformed into a physical pres-
ence onto the streets and squares of a community.
It is only when the common 
man or woman protests alone (as in the case where a Buddhist 
monk self-immolated himself at a 
road intersection in Saigon in pro-test of the religious persecution the Buddhists faced in South Viet-nam in the 1960s) or with others (as in the case when Muslims and 
Christians joined hands in Tahrir 
Square, Cairo, last year) that the decision-makers are forced to bow down to such immense, almost su-
pernatural popular pressure and 
change their wretched ways.
This, my fellow Gators, is the 
way the world works. Don’t ex-pect that your reading of this let-
ter or your sharing of a post will 
change the world a tiny bit.
Genuine change requires phys-
ical work; whether it be going 
from door-to-door or gathering 
at a street protesting the brutality sanctioned by a government.
Why? Not because I nor any-
one involved in the humanitarian 
effort need you to come. The Syr-
ian people don’t even need you.
Rather, your coming will simply 
quench the thirst your moral con-
science has felt since you walked 
by, eyes cast down, ignoring the Salvation Army Santa Claus out-
side of Walmart last winter.

Unite Party fails to uphold 
promise of transparency
The Transparency in Execu-
tive Agencies Act was an uncon-
troversial piece of legislation that 
would have increased transpar-
ency in the Accent Speakers Bu-reau and Student Government Productions. Both of these agen-
cies receive almost half a million 
dollars of student funding each year.
Transparency is a point that 
both parties had on their plat-forms during this past election 
season, but it is still not being re-
alized in Senate.
Simply put, the Transparency 
in Executive Agencies Act re-quires Accent to publicly release the names of those individuals 
who receive complimentary or 
VIP tickets, like those given for ﬂ  oor seating in the Seth Meyers show two weeks ago.The release of these names 
used to be done on a regular basis by Accent chairmen and treasur-
ers in the past but was inexplica-
bly stopped two years ago.
The current Accent Chairman, 
Corey Portnoy, claims the Student 
Senate does not have access to 
these lists because “all tickets are complimentary,” but I ask you, as a student, if you think this is fair.
If you are waiting for a show 
hours before it starts and some-one waltzes past you to special seating, aren’t you entitled to know who that is, especially 
when your activity fees pay for 
the shows?
The Students Party attempted 
to reach across the aisle and fulﬁ  ll a promise of transparency to The 
Gator Nation, but this bill was not even discussed in Senate. The Ju-
diciary Committee ruled that the bill should not be heard based on the vague idea of “implication” that the judiciary chairman him-
self could not even deﬁ  ne.
This piece of legislature was 
struck down by six senators in a 
shady committee meeting so that 
no student would see Unite cor-
ruptly vote against it.
The Unite Party message is 
clear: No transparency. Not now, not ever.
The only way students can 
have an open and free govern-ment is by getting involved and taking action now.
I urge all interested students to 
apply for open Senate seats, the 
cabinet positions that are open-
ing in early April and positions in Accent, SGP and any other exec-utive agency to put the students back into Student Government.
Applications can be found at 
sg.uﬂ  .edu under “Apply Now” at the lower left-hand corner.

I know many of you are disappointed you did not win the $640 
million Mega Millions jackpot over the weekend. Dreams of 
never working again, living the high life and naming UF after 
yourself are gone forever.
However, when I read that the winner will owe $161.7 mil-
lion in federal taxes, it got me thinking about the injustice of Tax 
Day.
The usual response I hear from my progressive friends about 
the alternative minimum tax, lottery, gift, estate and other “not affecting me” taxes is that we should heap them on like ice cream. 
After all, the people earning the windfall did nothing to deserve that money. Therefore, it should be redistributed to everyone, 
since random chance gave them an unfair lump-sum payment.
To look at why this mentality penalizes the top 10 percent 
way more than the top 1 percent, let’s compare the three win-
ners of the Mega Millions lottery to a surgeon making an annual 
income of $500,000.
To make the comparison easier, let’s assume that the doctor 
and the lottery winners all live in New York City. The mega mil-lionaires will owe a total of $199.5 million in taxes. Assuming a 
combined tax rate of about 12 percent in NYC and a federal in-
come tax rate of 35 percent, the doctor takes home $286,000. One 
also has to account for about $6,000 in Social Security tax and 
maybe $6,000 in Medicare taxes under the new tax rules passed by the Obama White House, leaving our surgeon with $274,000 
in take-home pay.
If we assume $5,000 per month for rent/mortgage and $5,000 
per month for private school tuition for two children, the sur-
geon’s salary is down to $154,000. Take away another $5,000 per month for food costs for the whole family and $5,000 per month 
for insurance costs, transportation, utilities and miscellaneous expenses, and we are down to $34,000 per year to spend lav-
ishly.
Some will say that the problem with my example is that the 
lottery winners should pay 75 percent in taxes and the doctor 
should be allowed to just pay 25 percent. The issue is not the 
progressiveness of the tax code, but that it takes a huge bite out of the merely afﬂ  uent, while leaving the true oligarchs in ﬁ  ne shape. The lottery is a somewhat special example, but think of 
people like Steve Jobs, Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerburg. All of 
these men essentially won an even bigger lottery by creating in-
credibly useful products for the entire world to use. These guys 
probably had some of the best lawyers and accountants in the world character-
ize their incomes as long-term capital 
gains so they could get that 15-percent 
tax rate. Meanwhile, the surgeon is 
working 70-hour weeks transplanting 
organs and gets hit with the 35-percent tax rate.
Warren Buffett wants to increase 
the drastic difference between the take-
home pay of money managers and heart surgeons. By raising income taxes to 39.8 percent, we would force real-world people who don’t drive Bentleys or shop at Tiffany’s to make tough 
choices like pulling their kids out of their preferred school, low-ering malpractice insurance or moving to a cheaper residence. 
These can all be valid decisions, but they shouldn’t be forced by a change in the tax code.
The metaphorical lottery winners of the world pay a large 
amount in taxes, but they can afford the best help money can 
buy to legally avoid as much tax as possible. This reality will 
always be the case, and the rich will become better at dodging 
taxes as they increase.
It is clear there is a direct relationship between income tax 
rates and effort spent on not paying them. When the lottery win-
ners die, their heirs will receive hundreds of millions, but they 
probably won’t pay the full 35-percent death tax because of their 
professional armies.
Meanwhile, the surgeon who saved up several million over 
a lifetime of tough, long weeks will have to fork over the full 35 percent above the $5-million exemption because that person 
was probably a lot more attentive to saving people’s lives than to 
their personal ﬁ  nances.
In life, we shouldn’t punish the lottery winners or the white-
collar workhorses. Low taxes encourage entrepreneurial risk and create more social justice through long-term growth than 
any redistributive program.
At the rate Washington is spending money, I’m just glad in-
come taxes aren’t already at 100 percent.

SANFORD — The rise and 
fall of the crowd’s cheers almost 
drowned out the speech as Marie 
Dino and Chrisley Carpio watched 
the stage from a crowded grass lawn.
The Rev. Al Sharpton told those 
gathered in Sanford that protest-ing didn’t make them extremists, it made them heroes.
“We are not the troublemak-
ers,” he said. “We are the trouble-
breakers.”
Carpio and Dino, both 20-year-
old UF students, shouted in agree-
ment.
About 30 UF students joined 
more than 3,000 demonstrators in Sanford on Saturday to demand the arrest of George Zimmerman, 28, and the permanent removal of 
Sanford Sheriff Bill Lee.
These calls come more than 
a month after Sanford police 
said Zimmerman shot and killed 
17-year-old Trayvon Martin. Po-
lice said Trayvon was walking home, unarmed, on Feb. 26, when Zimmerman called police and told them he was following a suspi-
cious-looking person.
The two fought, and Zimmer -
man shot and killed Trayvon. 
Zimmerman told police he acted 
in self-defense.
Zimmerman hasn’t been ar -
rested, partly because of Florida’s 
Stand Your Ground law, which gives citizens the right to use 
deadly force in self-defense if they 
are attacked in a place they have a right to be.
Florida is one of 24 states with 
similar self-defense laws — stat-utes that have been called into question in the aftermath Tray-von’s death.
Since then, protests have 
erupted in cities across the state. Gainesville has had at least two in the past week.
When the protests started in the 
town where Trayvon was shot, UF Students for a Democratic Society members decided they had to be a part of it.
Dino’s mint-green VW bug 
cruised through the UF campus at 8 a.m. Saturday. She and Carpio picked up Eric Brown, 18, and Al-exa Kristensen, 19, from Turling-
ton Plaza to fill up the car for the 
trip to Sanford.
Dino and Carpio said they 
learned how to keep protests peaceful and how to reach out to 
the media from older members of 
SDS. The student activist organiza-tion protests issues ranging from immigration to tuition.
“People think activists just yell 
to yell, but it’s not true. What we do is very structured,” said Dino, a member of SDS and an education sophomore.
She said people don’t see their 
work off the streets, which in-cludes negotiations, planning and 
writing news releases and propos-
als.
“We don’t expect results over -
night,” said Carpio, a history sophomore and organizer for SDS. 
“You need a lot of patience.”           
Dino and Carpio are no strang-
ers to the protest scene.
They said SDS has held rallies 
against block tuition and Univer -
sity Police after police shot an in-
ternational graduate student, Kofi  Adu-Brempong, on March 2, 2010.
The size of those protests paled 
in comparison to the one at San-ford.
Walking up to the demonstra-
tion, what looked like a gray mass 
slowly became thousands of pro-
testers waving the now-iconic black-and-white image of a hood-
ed Trayvon.
Those gathered ranged in age 
— some came in strollers, while 
others pushed walkers. Some 
brought entire families.
Civil rights leaders including 
Sharpton and the Rev. Jesse Jack-
son, surrounded by marshals at the front of the crowd, led a march 
to the Sanford Police Department.
Slowly, the congested crowd 
began to shuffle toward the protest route. Chants ebbed and flowed 
when leaders of call-and-follow cheers exhausted their voices.
Along the protest path, shops 
with run-down brick walls were closed.
The streets were littered with 
onlookers and people selling food. Some pushed shopping carts full 
of T-shirts reading “Justice for 
Trayvon” and sold them for $10 each.
One man, 56-year-old Frank 
Moore, drove from Columbia, S.C., to Sanford to sell his shirts at the rally.
The crowd grew more enthusi-
astic as the Sanford Police Depart-
ment came into view.
Sharpton and Jackson spoke 
in front of the department, along 
with various pastors and represen-
tatives from the NAACP .
Between speakers, UF students 
yelled, “The people united will 
never be divided.”
An older woman stopped the 
group and told them they were saying the words wrong.
“It’s the people united will nev-
er be defeated,” she said. “Because 
when we’re together, there’s noth-
ing we can’t do.”
Some with the UF group wore 
hoodies, which have become sym-bols of the movement.
But by the end of the protests, 
Carpio regretted her wardrobe choice.
“Maybe the thick hoodie was 
a bad idea,” she said, smiling and wiping sweat from her brow.

For once, it wasn’t the Gators celebrating. 
When Preston Tucker’s ninth-inning throw home 
sailed wide of catcher Mike Zunino, Rebels sophomore 
Bobby Wahl crossed home plate, starting a team-wide 
mixture of celebrating and taunting that prompted Ole Miss coach Mike Bianco to apologize to UF coach Kevin O’Sullivan. 
The Gators had lost a series for the first time this sea-
son.
“We’ll have to learn from it,” O’Sullivan said. “We 
made plenty of mistakes. … It’s disappointing but there’s 
nothing we can do about it now.”
Minutes before Tucker’s misfire, 
there had been talks of a tie. Sunday’s ninth inning was going to be the final inning regardless of score because of a 
travel deadline for the Gators. Another inning would not be started after 4:45 p.m. Instead, there was a decision, and it was a 7-6 loss for No. 1 Florida (24-4, 
6-3 Southeastern Conference) at the hands of No. 16 Ole 
Miss (20-8, 5-4 SEC). 
The day began as rough as it ended for the Gators. 
Sophomore righty Jonathon Crawford’s run of good 
fortunes ended as he was pulled after just 1.2 innings. He 
gave up five earned runs and put the Gators in a hole dif-
ficult to escape. Fueling the outburst from Ole Miss was junior second baseman Alex Yarbrough, who went 4 for 5 on the day with three RBI, a triple and a double. Florida loses in ninth, drops first series this season to Ole Miss

� UF TOOK ADVANTAGE OF SIX 
YELLOW CARDS TO WIN 20-11.
JOSH JURNOVOY

After a quick start on Sunday, Penn 
State got physical.
The Gators made them pay for do-
ing so.
No. 4 Florida (12-2, 2-0 American 
Lacrosse Conference) scored a season-
high five man-up goals in a 20-11 win 
against No. 10 Penn State (8-3, 1-1 ALC).
“[Sunday] was just a great day to 
show that we can stay with all the teams that are physical,” junior at-
tacker Ashley Bruns said.
With the Nittany Lions leading 3-1 
more than six minutes into the game, junior midfielder Brittany Dashiell cut 
the Gators’ deficit to one when she 
was knocked to the ground while put-
ting a shot past PSU’s Dana Cahill, the 2011 ALC Goalkeeper of the Year. No foul was called on the play, but less than two minutes later Dashiell was 
fouled high by midfielder Lizzy Car -
ney as she was taking the ball through 
the arc, the first 
of Penn State’s 
six yellow cards 
on the day. 
Dashiell flipped the ensuing free-
position shot to junior attacker Caro-line Chesterman on the left side of the 
crease, and she put it past Cahill to tie 
the game.
The Nittany Lions did not lead the 
rest of the way.
Coach Amanda O’Leary said she Gators put up 20 in ALC 
win against Penn State

Bob van Overbeek watched as his oppo-
nent’s shot slowly bounced in front of him. 
The junior set his feet, brought his racket 
back and blasted a thunderous forehand 
past his helpless opponent.
That was a recurring theme on Sunday 
not just for van Overbeek, but for all of the 
Gators. Aggressive, confident play helped 
No. 11 Florida (12-7, 5-3 Southeastern Con-ference) beat Alabama in a 7-0 sweep,  the team’s third win in a row. Just as the regu-lar season is winding down, the Gators are 
beginning to play their best tennis. 
Perhaps most important for Florida has 
been the resurgence of van Overbeek, the 
team’s top singles player. After a stretch 
in which he lost match after match to chal-
lenging opponents, he has been able to as-sert himself and play his best tennis of the season during the last two weeks. 
“Whenever he can win some matches, 
especially when you beat guys as good as the guys he’s beaten, you gain some confi-dence,” coach Andy Jackson said. “He did some good things when he wasn’t winning, and so did we as a group. The most impor -
tant thing is that he gained confidence by doing some good things.”
This weekend, van Overbeek played 
dominant tennis, using a big serve and explosive forehand to overpower his op-ponents. He won his match Friday against 
Auburn on an ace, and was judicious in the 
use of power shots on Sunday. It has been 
somewhat of a change for him, as earlier in the sea-son he was waiting for shots to create themselves 
rather than making his own offense.
That mentality shift has 
been contagious through-
out the team. Florida’s 
players have been more 
aggressive across the board, putting points away to save their energy. But that formula has only in the last few matches yielded 
positive results. Van Overbeek leads UF to sweep

PREVIEWING THE ORANGE AND BLUE DEBUT
With the Gators’ annual spring game, the Orange and Blue Debut, scheduled for Saturday at 1 p.m., we at alligatorSports want to get you prepared. Each day this week, we will give you a new piece 
from three separate top-five lists: something to look for during the spring game, an area the team must improve upon in 2012 and a major storyline to follow as the spring season comes to a close. Today, we look at the receivers, the red-zone offense and Will Muschamp’s second season at the helm.
� SOMETHING TO LOOK FOR DURING SATURDAY’S GAME:
5. Wide receivers/playmakers
Last season, Florida struggled to get the ball in the hands of anyone not named Jeff Demps or Chris Rainey, especially in the passing game. Rainey led the team in receptions and the Gators do not return a wide receiver who had more than 20 catches last season. Quinton Dunbar has been called out by coach Will Muschamp, who is looking for the sophomore to step up and lead the receiving corps. Andre Debose returns from a season in which he showed the ability to stretch the field, and freshmen Latroy Pittman 
and Ja’Juan Story also will factor into the mix. Tight ends Jordan Reed, A.C. Leonard (should he return) and Kent Taylor also have potential. But there’s one common denominator across the board: None of these Gators are proven. Regardless of who’s throwing Saturday, focus on the play outside the numbers. Can the receivers get open and create separation? Are they crisp coming out of their breaks? And, most importantly, can they catch?� AREA THAT NEEDS IMPROVEMENT:
5. Red-zone offense
Had Florida been more efficient inside the 20-yard line a sea-son ago, Muschamp and former offensive coordinator Charlie Weis would have enjoyed a much more successful season. The Gators made it to the red zone just 37 times and scored touchdowns on only 48.65 percent of their opportunities, rank-ing 113th nationally. Enter Brent Pease, whose Boise State of-fense ranked in the top eight in red-zone trips (70), touchdowns (52) and touchdown percentage (74.29). Florida lost four games by 14 points or fewer last season, and with inexperi-
ence at quarterback regardless of who wins the starting job, close games are again likely this year.  Can the Gators turn it around in one season? If so, it could be the difference between several more close losses and a second straight disappointing season or a few signature wins and a return to a BCS bowl.

 Dunbar
� STORYLINE TO WATCH:
5. Year 2 under Muschamp 
By all accounts, the situation Muschamp entered a 
season ago was far from optimal. But now Coach Boom has had a year to instill his ways on the program, and history dictates that a head coach’s second season is when the judgment can truly begin. Muschamp has weeded out the trouble-makers and brought in players that fit his system, and now those rabid fans in Gator Nation will start to see if Muschamp has laid the proper foundation for a restoration project designed to bring 
the program back to national prominence. Expectations shouldn’t include a trip to South Florida for the BCS Championship, but significant improvement upon a six-loss season is expected. For the first time since the Zook Era, it was embarrassing at times to be a Gators fan last season. Muschamp knows that has to change.

O’Sullivan: ‘It is disappointing how we played in certain situations’
“We just didn’t get a good start from 
Jonathon,” O’Sullivan said.
But as it has done for most of the season, 
the UF offense bounced back. 
Florida erupted in the fourth inning, 
racking up four runs on RBI hits from No-
lan Fontana and Justin Shafer, as well as 
a solo home run by senior Daniel Pigott. 
Things kept rolling in the sixth and seventh innings when Fontana and Preston Tucker each hit a solo home run to give the Gators their first lead of the day. 
“I was pleased with the way we swung 
the bats,” O’Sullivan said. “I thought we 
battled like heck and I felt really good 
about the game. Unfortunately we had a couple mistakes there at the end.”
Battling both travel plans and an Ole 
Miss team that tied the game at 6-6 in the 
bottom of the seventh, Florida brought in 
closer Austin Maddox. He didn’t allow a hit until one out in the ninth when Gainesville native Will Allen singled to right on a ball O’Sullivan said he thought Tucker should have caught. 
Then, after another single and an inten-
tional walk, Tucker moved in from right 
field to play next to first, giving Florida five infielders. When freshman Senquez 
Golson dribbled a ball Tucker’s way, the senior could not make the play. It was Gol-son’s first at-bat of the game and his fifth RBI of the year.
“I’m proud of our guys for battling back, 
but it is disappointing how we played [Sunday] in certain situations,” O’Sullivan 
said. 
Ole Miss took the series behind a domi-
nant pitching performance by Wahl on 
Friday. Florida was able to avoid a sweep when it scored six runs in the eighth inning 
of Saturday’s game en route to a 9-4 win.

Deana Allen has never beaten her dad in 
one-on-one.
As Greg Stewart recalls, the last time they 
played against each other, Allen was in eighth 
grade. 
With each basket counting one point, Stew-
art said he spotted his daughter three points in the first game and defeated her, 12-6.
He wasn’t so generous in the rematch, spot-
ting Allen zero points and beating her again. However, Allen was not deterred.
“She said, ‘I want to play again!’” Stewart 
said. “And then I said, ‘What are we going to play again for? I beat you twice already.’”
The losses stung Allen, who was about to 
begin playing basketball at Ellender Memorial High in Houma, La.
Allen, the first player off the bench for Flor -
ida’s NCAA Tournament squad this season, was four years away from being named Miss Basketball in Louisiana.
“It made me mad,” Allen said. “I would 
cry. I was like, ‘No, we’re not going to stop playing until I get a game won.’”
Allen’s tears eventually dried, but her de-
sire to come out on top never went away.
Stewart, a long-time youth basketball 
coach, said he denied his daughter victory be-cause he wanted to motivate her to keep build-ing on her promising game.
“That was definitely something I held over 
her,” Stewart said. “You’ve got to keep work-ing. Stay hungry. Stay motivated. Know what 
you’re working toward.”
Part of Allen’s growth came from playing in a boys’ youth league when she was 7 years 
old.
At the end of her second season, she made 
the league’s All-Star team, but her path wasn’t free of bumps and bruises.
“It was competitive — rough,” Allen said. 
“They used to beat me, of course. I used to hate losing. I wanted to fight, but that made 
me only want to get better.”
Nowadays, Allen will challenge her dad to 
play another game of one-on-one, but Stewart 
does not want to tarnish his legacy.
He declines to become a victim of the mon-
ster he created.
“Every time she comes home, she says, 
‘C’mon, let’s go to the gym,’ and I say, ‘Ah, I don’t want to go today,’” Stewart said. “(Al-
len says) ‘C’mon, let’s go to the gym, I’m ready 
for you!’ ‘Nah, I’m too old. I’ll catch you next time.’”
  
Allen learned responsibility at an early 
age.
While she lived with both her parents dur -
ing her early childhood, Allen spent the ma-jority of her formative years living with her mother and three of her seven younger sib-lings in Houma.
She said growing up in Mechanicville, 
a “rough” neighborhood, was, at times, “a struggle.”
“It was a hard job for my mom because 
she was working like two jobs here and there 
just trying to provide,” Allen said. “So, she 
couldn’t really keep her eye on us like she wanted to.”
As the oldest child in the household, Al-
len decided to help her mother by setting a good example for her siblings, which she did through basketball.
Allen took her love for the game and turned 
it into a ticket for higher education, becoming 
the first person on either side of her family to 
attend college.
“I’m just taking pride in my role (as an old-
er sibling),” said Allen, who will graduate in May with a degree in Anthropology . “I’m just making the best of what I did because I have younger siblings that are watching and want-ing to follow in my footsteps.”
Perhaps the sibling most inspired by Al-
len’s efforts is her 18-year-old brother, Aaron Smith.
Their mother, Tasha Allen, said Smith, who 
plays basketball and football for Vanderbilt Catholic High  in Houma, wishes he had been born earlier like his 21-year-old sister, Brittany Allen, so he could be in college with Deana.
“Everything he do, he bases it on Deana. 
Everything he do,” Tasha Allen said.  “If he’s 
ever got a question about basketball or any-
thing he needs to know, he calls Deana.”
Growing up in Houma, there were in-
creased safety concerns for Allen’s family.
“[Mechanicville is] a drug zone, a crime 
zone,” said Cory Butler, the principal of El-lender. “It’s pretty tough to raise kids in it.”
Despite facing the odds of a tough neigh-
borhood, Allen’s father expected his daughter 
to avoid the pitfalls of peer pressure.
He said Allen learned early on to be a leader 
rather than a follower, which has helped mold 
her into the person she is today.
“Everybody’s got to have discipline in their 
homes if you want your kids to go straight,” Stewart said. “That doesn’t mean they ain’t going to go cut around a corner on you or try to find something out on their own. But if you 
instill [discipline] in them from [childhood], 
they can always come back around and get back on track.”  
Allen signed with the University of New 
Orleans, a Division-I school, after her junior year of high school.
However, her plans changed senior year 
and she never made her way to The Big Easy.
“There was a period of time where we 
weren’t sure she was going make her ACT score or not to qualify to play Division I,” Pen-sacola State College coach Chanda Rigby said.
Rigby met with Stewart and explained to 
him that Allen could take the junior college route, the path Allen ultimately chose when she signed with Pensacola State College.
Allen drew national attention in her two 
years with the Pirates, leading the NJCAA in scoring for 14 weeks during her senior sea-son.
Near the end of the recruiting process, Al-
len was ready to commit to Oklahoma, but Rigby convinced her leading scorer and highly coveted guard to take all her visits.
Allen signed with the Gators soon after vis-
iting Florida, a place where Rigby believes the Houma native has thrived.
“Deana is probably my favorite coaching 
story ,” Rigby said. “A lot of people she was surrounded by maybe didn’t get out of town 
and do anything, and she could have definitely 
done what was easy and made that choice.”

In her second season at Florida, Allen be-
came the Gators’ do-everything player.
Averaging 19.3 minutes per game, Allen 
was constantly involved in the gameplan, 
leading UF with a 27.1 usage percentage, ac-
cording to WBBState.com.
She also ranked second on the team with 
16.1 points per 40 minutes, a 14.3 rebound rate and a 3.9 steal rate.
“She really gets to the basket well; she’s a 
great penetrator,” fellow senior guard Lanita Bartley said. “But one thing she has that really stands out to me is her defense.”
Allen’s play on both sides of the ball im-
pressed rival SEC coaches enough for them to name her the league’s Co-6th Woman of the Year.
“Everything she do is awesome, to me, 
when it comes down to basketball because she do it with her heart,” Tasha Allen said.
While Allen leaves Florida as a member of 
the senior class that helped propel the Gators 
back to The Big Dance, her pursuit of success 
runs deeper than just adding another year to the banners hanging by the practice court.
Allen said she would like to remain in-
volved with basketball for the next five to 10 years, preferably playing.
She got a head start on her post-college 
basketball pursuits at this year’s Women’s Basketball Coaches Association National Con-
vention, attending the “So You Want To Be A 
Coach” program, a seminar for graduating se-niors who have used up their eligibility.
Butler says that Allen still has some learn-
ing to do before she pursues coaching, a pro-fession made up of more than just practices and games. 
“She’s the type of person, with her experi-
ences, that she could really be an impact on a 
lot of young ladies’ lives,” Butler said.
No matter what Allen does from here on 
out, she proudly represents her family and her 
past. But until she is satisfied with her success, she’ll keep begging for a rematch.
“A lot of people may look back at Houma 
and kind of like frown on it just because of where it’s at and what it is,” Allen said. “But a lot of good people have come from there. And 
I think of myself as a good person that has 
made the doors open for myself from a neigh-borhood, a home like Mechanicville.”

After transferring from Pensacola State College, guard Deana Allen found a spot as the 
first player off the bench for UF, winning this year’s SEC Co-6th Woman of the Year award. 
Allen perserveres through challenges to excel at UFIt’s a style of tennis that should 
bode well for the Gators come tour -
nament time. 
With the SEC Tournament fewer 
than three weeks away, Florida’s 
increased confidence should allow them to coast into the postseason. 
That, Jackson said, is the ultimate 
goal.
“We’ve got 
to focus on the Gators and what 
we can do to get 
better,” he said.Also playing the Crimson Tide,

O’Leary earns win No. 200 on Sunday
was pleased with her team for taking advantage of its 
man-up opportunities to get back in the game.
“They showed a lot of maturity [Sunday] in the ability 
to come back from that,” O’Leary said.
In the next six minutes, the Gators scored three more 
goals in man-up situations. Freshman midfielder Shan-non Gilroy scored the third of those goals on a free-po-
sition shot to make it 6-3, the first of her game-high five 
goals. Gilroy was then fouled less than two minutes later when taking the ball to the goal, and she put another free-position shot past Cahill.
“I was confident in myself,” Gilroy said. “Knew that I 
was going to get it in the back of the net.”
The six yellow cards were a game-high for a UF op-
ponent this season. The fifth was called on attacker Elaine Welch with 5:31 remaining in the first half. Only North 
Carolina and Syracuse have received four or more yellow 
cards in one game against UF this season. The Tar Heels did not receive their fourth yellow card until seven min-utes into the second half, while the Orange’s fourth came 
in overtime.
Gilroy, who also finished with a game-high seven 
draw controls, was relentless in attacking the net despite 
the aggressive Penn State defense. She scored on another free-position shot in the second half after getting fouled 
inside the arc.
“She’s got a nose for the goal,” 
O’Leary said.
With the win, O’Leary became the 
12th Division I coach to reach 200 ca-reer victories. But, following the game, 
she downplayed the significance of her achievement and gave credit to her as-sistant coaches and her players for the 
offense’s success.
“(Assistant coaches Erica LaGrow and Caitlyn Mc-
Fadden) do a great job with our offense and creating opportunities for our attackers to score in those man-up 
situations,” O’Leary said. “Ultimately, the onus is on the 
players to go out there and score and they did.”LACROSSE , from page 13
