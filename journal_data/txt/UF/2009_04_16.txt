n THE GROUP WAS IN      
FAVOR OF A FAIR TAX.

Larry Middleton sat outside 
City Hall for nearly four hours 
Wednesday, wielding a sign that 
read, “The problem with social-
ism is that eventually you run out of other people’s money.”
Middleton, along with about 
a thousand other dissenters, pro-tested the Internal Revenue Ser-vice by grabbing the attention of passers-by and voicing their op-position.
Some signs were hoisted high 
by men and women. Others were propped up by toddlers in stroll-ers.
“I like paying taxes,” Middle-
ton said, “but I like paying my fair share.”
Roz Miller, county coordina-
tor for the Alachua County Fair 
Tax Group, said Fair Tax sup-
ports a national sales tax in place of an income tax, which is not 
paid by everyone in the United 
States.
“Do you think a drug dealer’s 
going to fill out a tax form and 
put ‘occupation: drug dealer’?” 
she said. “A lot of money goes through those hands, and they all shop.”
Miller said the sales tax should 
be about 22 percent, which would 
help generate revenue from those 
who don’t pay taxes now.
“We are a nation of consum-
ers,” she said. “And everyone 
shops.”

UF student Robin Garg, 22, was ar-
rested for  groping a UF student outside 
Library West on Tuesday night. 
Garg later confessed to groping 32 
other female students on campus since 
last Friday, according to University Po-
lice Department. Lt. Darren Baxley.
Garg is accused of groping each of 
the women after telling them he was trying to remove a bug from their bod-ies.
He told police he went on the grop-
ing spree because he “liked to scare women,” Baxley said.
He said Garg has only been charged 
once with a misdemeanor battery, but Baxley expects the number of charges to increase when the other victims iden-tify Garg as their attacker.
As of Wednesday morning, UPD 
had received 15 to 18 calls from women 
who might have been groped by Garg. Al-
though he admitted 
to 33 incidents, Bax-ley said he doesn’t think that is the exact number. 
“We’re still trying 
to flesh that out,” he said.
Baxley said it appears Garg targeted 
white, student-aged females.
“It seems to be pretty consistent,” he 
said.

The Gainesville Code of Ordinances re-
mains a source of contention for local com-
mittees after a Thursday meeting about revi-sions to its anti-discrimination chapter.
Gainesville’s Equal Opportunity Com-
mittee will recommend that the City Com-mission adopt a series of revisions, which deal with the ordinance’s effect on busi-nesses. 
Commissioner Craig Lowe, chair of the 
committee and founder of pro-ordinance group Equality is Gainesville’s Business, explained his proposed revisions, which would delete pieces of the ordinance requir-ing businesses to modify their buildings to fit the ordinance.
“We are proposing that the city commis-sion modify the ordinance to remove any re-mote possibility that businesses would have to construct facilities any different than they would under the building codes,” Lowe said. 
Instead, the ordinance would include a 
blanket exemption for businesses where pa-
trons in shared show-ering or dressing facili-ties cannot avoid being seen fully unclothed.
 “We’re trying to address the concerns 
of the business community,” he said. “They came to us in an atmosphere of collabora-tion to work together to find a solution that’s best for the entire community.”
Mark Minck, chair of Citizens for Good 
Public Policy, said that while he commend-ed the committee for addressing the con-Commission hears changes

PALATKA (AP) — Authorities believe 
two escaped Florida inmates who are still 
on the loose killed a 66-year-old woman and stole two cars.
Police say 23-year-old Doni Ray Brown 
and 25-year-old Timothy Wayne Fletcher broke out of the Putnam County Jail in Palat-ka at 4 a.m. Wednesday and stole a truck. Palatka is about 40 miles east of Gainesville in northeastern Florida.
Later, authorities discovered a car missing and its owner, Helen Key Googe, dead inside her Palatka home.
Putnam County Lt. Johnny Greenwood 
says Googe was related to one of the sus-pects.
Brown was arrested Aug. 17 and charged 
with robbery with a firearm. Fletcher was ar-rested March 3 on three counts of failure to appear on an aggravated assault charge.
Police would not say how the pair es-
caped.Avenuethe

Leaning forward in a cushioned chair in 
City Hall, Mayor Pegeen Hanrahan listened 
intently as a constituent laid out her concerns, the same focus she gave county officials dis-cussing next year’s budget an hour later. 
Although such a procession of appoint-
ments could be seen as an ordinary day in the life of a mayor, Hanrahan said it is difficult to pinpoint exactly what normal would be.
“I always say it’s never dull,” she said.Hanrahan, who is in her second term as 
mayor, was first elected in 2004. After gradu-ating from UF in 1992, Hanrahan was hired as an engineer for the Alachua County Environ-
mental Protection Department’s hazardous 
materials program.
That position sparked her interest in seek-
ing political office, she said.
“I really liked local government and the in-
teraction with citizens,” Hanrahan said.
So in 1996, Hanrahan decided to enter the 
race on the last day of registration.She won the election, going on to serve for 
six years as the city commissioner for District 3, which encompasses UF. 
In general, Hanrahan works in City Hall 
Monday, Tuesday and Thursday and meets constituents on Wednesdays and Fridays, she said. Yet such a schedule is hardly set in stone, she added, as she pulled out her BlackBerry to see if she was going to be in Tallahassee on a particular evening, and again to check what 
days she would be in Washington.
She also carries an iPhone, which she used 
to show off a picture of her children, Evyleen, 
3, and Quinn, 2.
“They’re my little darlins,” she said.From a meeting with four women repre-
senting the Action Network of North Central Florida, a faith-based community group, to appointments with county staff, Hanrahan 
listened attentively to everyone’s opinions be-
fore responding. 
Regardless of who was speaking, she kept 
her blue eyes fixed on them, laughing and smiling during casual conversation and nod-ding intently when subjects turned grim.In her first meeting that afternoon, Hanra-
han entered the small room and shook hands with the women from the Action Network and took a seat at the head of the table.
After chatting about mutual acquaintances 
and church life, Hanrahan asked how their or-
ganization was faring.
They went on to discuss 
helping low-income fami-lies make their homes more 
energy-efficient, the closing 
of Shands at Alachua Gen-eral Hospital and the stimu-
lus money Gainesville has received.
Hanrahan, who normal-
ly praises Obama, had criticism of his stimulus plan’s “shovel-ready” stipulation, which re-quires that projects be ready for construction 
to receive government stimulus dollars. 
This puts smaller communities at a disad-
vantage because they don’t always have the 
funds for preparation, she said.
When discussing the closure of AGH, 
which historically served lower-income resi-dents, Hanrahan shared the story of how 
she chose a pediatrician on the east side of 
Gainesville after she was told that “people like [her] don’t go there.”
“I said, ‘Sign me up for that,’” Hanrahan  
said.
Her penchant for inserting conversational 
tone into otherwise straightforward business carried into her meeting with Sol Hirsch, the county library director.
They debated online privacy in libraries, 
including patrons’ access to pornography, and discussed pensions for library employees.
At the end of the workday, Hanrahan’s du-
ties are anything but over.
With two young children, Hanrahan said 
it is a priority for her to be around during this “very precious point in their life.”
“For any working parent, the toughest part 
of their life is figuring out that work-life bal-ance,” she said.
Although being mayor takes time away 
from her family, Hanrahan says she feels lucky to be able give back to her hometown and views it as a once-in-a-lifetime experience. SpECIAL REpoRtHanrahan manages busy life with delicate balance

The Documentary Institute may be on the 
chopping block, but it’s not going quietly 
during this round of budget cuts.
Ana Habib, a graduate student enrolled 
in the program, worked with two Documen-
tary Institute alumni to get an online petition 
posted on Monday to help generate support. 
About 450 signatures were posted by 
Wednesday evening.  
Eric Flagger, one of the UF alumni who 
helped create the site, said 30 states and 13 countries are represented on the petition. 
“We were feeling powerless,” Flagger 
said. “It’s something we decided was impor-
tant for the dean and the president to see.” 
Flagger said each time the petition is 
signed, an email is sent to UF President Ber-
nie Machen, UF Provost Joe Glover and Rep-resentative Larry Cretul.
“We want to make sure we exhaust all 
possible options before we let (the institute) disappear at its peak,” he said.
Churchill Roberts, a professor in the Doc-
umentary Institute, said Rachel Grady, who was nominated for the Academy Award for her documentary “Jesus Camp,” signed the petition. 
Roberts said he cannot believe the 11-year-
old program is being cut since it is both award-winning and nationally ranked.
Two students enrolled in the Documen-
tary Institute also recently won the Student Emmy at the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences’ College Television Awards for their 
film “Standard Deviation.” Roberts said the 
program has now won the award two years in a row. 
“You know success breeds success,” he 
said, adding the program’s prominence has started to attract more students and grant money. “We were really beginning to blos-som. But a lot of our good things happen to be unfortunately overshadowed by the bad 
things.”
Flagger said if they do not receive a re-
sponse, they will consider taking the whole 
petition to Machen. However, he said they are taking things one step at a time.
“We’d really just like a good explanation,” 
Flagger said. 
In an interview earlier this semester, John 
Wright, dean of the College of Journalism 
and Communications, said he chose to cut 
the program because it is not as central to the college’s core mission as its four other de-partments.

Around the world, 800,000 to 
900,000 human beings are bought, sold or forced across the world’s bor-ders each year, according to a U.S. Department of State estimate. But Fri-
day night, some UF students will try 
to do their part to help.
A human trafficking awareness 
rally will be held in Turlington Room L007 at 6:30 p.m. on Friday. The rally is sponsored by Sigma Phi Lambda, a UF Christian sorority, and STALL, which stands for “stop trafficking and liberate lives.”
STALL is a nonprofit organiza-
tion that works in Moldova, a coun-try in Eastern Europe, to provide safe houses that protect girls from being sold into sex slavery. The founders of STALL worked in Moldovan and Ro-manian orphanages, seeing firsthand what happened when the girls left the orphanages at 16. 
Staci Good, president of Sigma Phi 
Lambda, said she was unaware of the enormous scope of human trafficking around the world before reading an article on ABC News about a girl be-ing abducted and forced into prosti-tution.  Good said she organized the 
rally because she wanted to do some-thing to prevent other girls form fall-ing into the dangerous cycle.
“Human trafficking is an enor-
mous issue that does not get enough awareness in the U.S.,” said Melissa Milroy, a Sigma Phi Lambda mem-ber. 
Good said part of the event is edu-
cating people that traf-ficking happens even in the U.S., though it is not as widespread as in other countries. 
“It is so scary that it could be your 
sister or your mom,” Good said. 
Two videos will be shown at the 
event, one about the STALL efforts in 
Moldova and another about human 
trafficking in the U.S. 
Andrew Cameron, a representative 
from STALL, and Natalie Gutium, a 17-year-old girl rescued by STALL, will speak about their experiences. 
In addition to raising awareness, 
the rally is also collecting donations, clothing and toiletries. And STALL 
will sell T-shirts reading “Clothes 
should be bought and sold. Not hu-mans” for $20, with all of the pro-ceeds going toward the safe houses in Moldova.Rally raises awareness

Crowds of students and faculty 
swarmed the small setup of two folding ta-
bles on the Plaza of the Americas Wednes-
day morning to snag a “free air purifier” or “houseplants with a purpose.”
The giveaway began at 9:50 a.m., and it 
took 40 minutes to strip the tables bare of 
300 peace lilies.
O2 for You, a public service campaign, 
teamed up with American Lung Associa-
tion, the Clean Air Council, Costa Farms, Earth Day and Gators for a Sustainable 
Campus to educate the public about a sus-
tainable solution for combating indoor air pollution. The lilies were free, but those who took one were asked to sign a large 
board pledging to live a greener life. 
Costa Farms, one of the nation’s largest 
indoor foliage growers, donated the 300 
peace lilies for the cause.
Indoor air pollution is one of the top  
U.S. health concerns, and plants are a nat-ural solution to purify the air, said Maria Calvert, who co-organized the event.
A houseplant can help reduce harm-ful chemicals that come from carpet, paint 
and even tobacco products.
Volunteers also passed out postcards  
with information on the best plants to use 
indoors and the benefits they provide.
According to the cards, using one house-
plant for each 100 square feet can remove up to 87 percent of indoor air pollutants.               
Vickie Mena, a recent UF political science 
graduate,  suffers from migraines, and un-til she got her plant, didn’t realize plants could do so much.
“I never knew there were specific plants 
that were better than others for cleaning the air,” Mena said.
O2 for You plans on visiting Atlanta 
and Chicago this year to spread the word 
about the benefits of plants and living 
green.  “Houseplants are just a way to 
get people started in going green,” Calvert said.On c AmPus

PRIDE AWARENESS MONTH.

“My orgasm defies you.”That’s what Christina Garcia 
De los Rios, a UF English junior and committee member of Pride Awareness Month, wrote on the back of her Paint Your Orgasm T-shirt last year. On the front, she painted her orgasm depicted as 
an explosion of bright colors. The 
Pride Student Union at UF  spon-
sored the Paint Your Orgasm day 
for the  Ninth Annual Pride Aware-ness Month, De los Rios said.
Pride Awareness Month aims 
to spread acceptance of the lesbi-
an, gay, bisexual and transgender 
community.
Members of Pride Student 
Union and other volunteers set up near the Reitz Union Wednes-
day with paint, paint brushes and white T-shirts so passing students 
and faculty could show how they 
think their orgasms would look.
The annual event is aimed to 
spread  sexuality awareness and cre-
ate an environment 
where it’s OK to 
talk about sex, said Pride Student Union member and UF sociology and Spanish senior Davier Rodri-
guez.
Not everyone is open to the idea 
of these walking, visible orgasms, though.
Rodriguez said a preacher had 
to be removed from the area one 
year for protesting the event.                                                      
Lorraine Wheat, one of the 
event directors, said most people 
are very receptive to it. In the past, 
she said there have been about 200 
students who have stopped by to 
paint a T-shirt.
Gabrielle Robinson, a UF fresh-
man and one of the first partici-pants, said she had been planning 
on coming to the event since she heard about it at the Pride Student 
Union comedy show on Monday.
For the first time, there was an 
evening follow-up event in the Re-
itz Union, Rodriguez said.    
The purpose of the follow-up, 
he said, was for everyone to wear the shirts they painted earlier and 
to share stories and poetry during 
the open-mic period. The event also featured a talk about safe sex 
by Teresa White of the Alachua 
County Health Department, also 
known as Condom Miranda.Students make T-shirts for ‘Paint Your Orgasm’ event

Raising taxes won’t fix higher education Dating DistractionStephen in Space
NASA names space 
treadmill after Colbert
UF is going through a tough period. It’s not ex-
actly surprising: The economy is in the gutter, so Florida (along with everywhere else) is losing 
revenue.
And when budget cuts creep in, so too come the self-
righteous calls for more taxes to fund education, includ-ing a state income tax.
Thankfully for those of us who will probably be pay-
ing income tax someday (around 38 percent of wage earners pay no income tax at all), a state income tax is not an option in Florida. Because an income tax is uncon-stitutional, 60 percent of voters would have to vote on a 
ballot in favor of higher taxes. Good luck with that.
But even if it was politically feasible, increasing taxes 
to fund higher education would still be a bad call. Higher 
education is not a requirement, and no one is forcing you 
to get a degree. College is a voluntary investment in your 
own future. It’s great to make an investment in oneself, but the government shouldn’t force others to pay for it.
Instead of raising taxes and forcing other people to 
pay for college, it would make more sense to raise tuition 
and have the people who benefit from college pay the 
cost. But as soon as you raise tuition, there are cries of “class warfare” and exploiting the poor.
When “class warfare” means making people pay for 
what they consume, we have lost all hope for society. The average starting salary for a student with a liberal arts degree was over $30,000 in 2005, and much higher for math and science students. So even if tuition gets jacked up to around $6,000 a year, the cost of the investment is 
still well worth the returns. If students can’t get need-
based aid or merit scholarship, they may have to — gasp — take out a loan to pay for their education, and then pay back that loan with the addi-tional income they get from their degree.
This is exactly what we expect 
law, business, medical and gradu-ate students to do, and they usu-ally manage to get by quite well 
for themselves. For some reason, 
though, to suggest that under-
graduates pay for their own degree is evil, conservative hate-speech.
On the other hand, if you can’t get aid or pay your 
own way and you don’t plan to be in a situation where you can repay your loans, then maybe college isn’t right for you. Yeah. Somebody had to say it.
The cost of college at public schools is grossly dis-
torted by subsidies. It becomes “the new high school.” The subsidies result in overconsumption of college, and make fewer resources available for the students who take their education seriously.
Some subsidy does make sense because there are 
positive externalities from more educated people, but that only occurs when the education is put to proper use. When people who aren’t suited for it attend college, there is no added benefit, but the cost for everyone goes up.
So complain all you like about how crappy UF has 
gotten during the recession. UF can’t offer a stellar edu-cation without more money. But don’t cry to everyone else to pay for it for you. Most people have better things to do with their earnings than give it to the mostly rich 
and white students at UF.

With businesses going 
bottoms-up quicker than dol-lar drafts at happy hour, the matchmaking industry has seen smooth sailing amid a treacherous current of finan-cial uncertainty.
According to an article on 
CNN.com, Americans have 
turned to companies such 
as LifeWorks Matchmaking, based in Ft. Lauderdale, in search of love when the latest financial figures show their portfolio plummeting to new depths.
For eHarmony.com, 
there’s little surprise behind 
the fact the company has 
enjoyed a 20 percent growth between Sept. 2008 and Jan. 2009 compared to the pre-vious year. Simply put, it’s easier to deal with uncer-tainty and lean times when you have someone else to of-fer you a distraction. With a few clicks of the mouse and a fabricated profile (complete 
with a particularly thin pho-
to), would-be loners can find love thanks to an assist from the matchmaking industry.
The Editorial Board is 
glad to see that someone be-sides big box stores (yeah, you Wal-Mart) and McDon-ald’s are managing to beat 
the odds with a profit margin 
in the black.
For now, we are blessed 
with feasting on the prover-bial manna known as Mid-town, but we’d like to think there is hope for us yet when we escape the bubble of col-lege and enter the real world.
But who knows, perhaps 
the time will come when a pair of his and hers 40s (smuggled in from Georgia) and beef jerky sounds like one hell of a Friday evening.Poor Stephen Colbert.
On what should have been a day of celebration, with 
NASA set to officially announce Colbert’s moniker as 
the new name of Node 3 on the International Space Station, 
ended in disappointment for the Comedy Central host.
While Colbert emerged victorious in an online voting 
contest to name the compartment on the station thanks to 
write-in votes from fans, NASA elected to rededicate Node 
3 as Tranquility – which finished a meager eighth in the poll. News of NASA tossing Colbert a curveball broke Tuesday evening as astronaut Sunita Williams appeared on “The Col-
bert Report” to inform the comedian of NASA’s decision.
The consolation prize for Colbert? Having a treadmill 
named in his honor.
Dubbed the “Comibined Operational Load Bearing Exter-
nal Resistance Treadmill” or COLBERT for short, the tread-
mill will be used by NASA astronauts while aboard the sta-
tion to exercise and maintain bone strength.
Luckily, Colbert took the heartbreak in stride. Instead of 
breaking down in tears or launching into a tirade of exple-tives, Colbert appeared grateful that his name will still have a presence in outer space – unless, of course, we were viewing 
a heavily edited version of the show.
The Editorial Board can’t help but laugh at the absurdity 
and attention Stephen Colbert has garnered over the course 
of the past couple of years. From his presidential election bid to showing his strength in numbers in the NASA voting, Col-
bert’s hybrid role as a political commentator and comedian has won over the hearts of millions of fans. With a storied 
history of theatrics already under his belt, we eagerly await what’s next on tap for the Comedy Central funny man.

Congrats to Karma Cream owners
In response to the Alligator’s Tuesday ar-
ticle “Ice cream shop opens today, will offer 
11 vegan flavors,” I would like to congratu-late Payal Patel and Kyle Fick on the opening of the Karma Cream ice cream shop. By stay-ing true to their ethical beliefs and featuring nearly a dozen delicious dairy-free choices, they are doing a great service to the com-munity by offering diners healthier, more eco-friendly options. In addition to helping students keep off that pesky “freshman 15,” by picking the vegan Peach Cobbler, Dream-sicle or any of the other dairy-free dishes, consumers won’t be contributing to a life-time of misery for a cow on a dairy farm. 
The nine million cows living on dairy 
farms in the United States spend most of their lives in large sheds or on feces-caked mud lots, where disease is rampant. Cows 
raised for their milk are repeatedly impreg-
nated. Their babies are taken away so that 
humans can drink the milk intended for the calves. When their exhausted bodies can no longer provide enough milk, they are sent to 
slaughter and ground up for hamburgers.
Thankfully, with so many delicious and 
cruelty-free options available at Karma 
Cream and other local restaurants, it’s eas-ier than ever to take a stand against animal 
abuse one cone at a time.

� � �Students should volunteer this summer
Remember that one-liner when you were 
writing your college admission essay or 
when you cast your ballot during the recent election? You know, the one about “saving the world” or “making a difference”? Well, guess what? This summer is your big oppor-tunity to fulfill that promise by improving your local community. 
With the national rate of unemployment 
in March at 8.5 and Florida’s percentage nearly one point higher at 9.4, more people are in desperate need of a helping hand. Yet with the rising numbers, the terrible irony is that when case loads are up, resources are down. Or to be quite frank, when more people need help, there is less help to go around, especially here within Alachua County where more than 22 percent of the population lives in poverty in comparison 
to the 12 percent of the total population in 
Florida. 
Moreover, it’s obvious that the poorest 
of families will be impacted the hardest by 
the deteriorating economy. Therefore, ev-
ery student at UF can make a difference this 
summer by volunteering free time through 
collecting unwanted clothes, feeding the hungry or mentoring kids. Individually, people may only have a subtle impact on the 
community, but collectively, we as students 
can make a lasting difference in our towns 
and cities which will help our fellow men live a better life.

Dear Jordan Johnson, aka stu-
dent body president-elect:
I would first like to con-
gratulate you on your first (of many) public speaking events. I had the 
distinct privilege of hearing Provost 
Joe Glover, distinguished econom-ics professor David Denslow and yourself, our soon-to-be student body president, speak on imminent budget cuts at Pugh Hall this past Tuesday from 6 to 7:30 p.m. With ex-ams upon us, you nonetheless must be eagerly anticipating May 1, your 
first day as student body president.
Let me remind you that you, 
more than any other student, have 
direct political sway and respect of our Florida legislators. These legis-lators hold the means to pass a one-cent sales tax that could effectively sustain not only UF, but the majority of public schools in this state dur-ing trying economic times. These legislators hold you in great esteem: not only have you been elected by your peers, but you are the physi-
cal student embodiment of our flag-
ship university that boasts an aver-age weighted high school GPA of 4.2 and a 1300 SAT in its entering freshmen class. And we are national champions. 
I would like to say that to best re-
flect the caliber and integrity of our beloved university, it behooves you 
to clearly and concisely communi-
cate your ideas and future agenda. Tuesday, I witnessed shaking hands, furtive glances that avoided the gaze of the crowd, the zealous peppering of “ums” and misconstructed fig-ures of speech. This was in front of a hefty crowd of about 70 students. When an in-quiry into what our SG-funded lobby-
ists are doing to pass legislation that 
will guard our university’s repu-
tation of excellence in the years to come, it was met with a pithy “They are doing their best.” When ques-tioned on why it seems unlikely that our stolid house of representatives is unyielding in their stance against a tax increase when we have lobbyists that earn over $100,000 was posed, 
you avoided answering the question 
altogether.
I hope this does not come as a 
surprise, Jordan Johnson, that I ask you to enroll in a public speaking course during Summer A. As our president, you are required to be on campus in the summer months, when enrollment temporarily dwin-dles and some of your responsibili-ties are less pronounced. Yes, you have recently begun a blog to wel-come open discussion about our 
budget crisis and yes, you have also 
made three trips to Tallahassee to lobby those who hold our future in check. But Tuesday you stated that we have 40,000 students when we actually have 52,271. 
Our current student body presi-
dent spends the majority of his of-fice hours perfecting solitaire skills; 
I implore you to thoroughly review 
the current allocation and distri-bution of the approximately $13.3 million SG budget, which averages $330 per student per year, to ensure in fair and balanced management. In an age of renewed interest in public service, we the students are wit-nessing future funding, which de-termines the worth of our degrees, trickle away before our eyes. When a lack of speaking ability and work-ing knowledge of your constituency 
is so apparent, I feel this summer can 
be best used to brush up on interact-ing with students beyond your vot-ing base of less than 9,000 and learn more about what it means to be an active student, a real Florida Gator- not just a Unite-machine elect. 
This university and its faculty are 
depending on you to not only paint 
a confident, articulate, educated im-
age, but to act as a liaison between those who hold the ropes to the guil-lotine and the 52,271 who lay help-lessly on the chopping block.

Thad Hammond Owens had long red 
hair and an equally bright red mustache 
and beard, but friends say he was better known for his uplifting and humorous personality. 
“He made you feel better when you 
were around him,” said David Reed, who met Owens nine months ago when he enrolled in Reed’s class. “He lived life wide open.”  
About 100 people attended Owens’ 
memorial Wednesday afternoon in the Newins-Ziegler Hall breezeway to com-memorate his life.   
Eleven people shared anecdotes for 
nearly an hour about his infectious na-ture and the effect he had on their lives. 
Owens, a 27-year-old wildlife ecology 
and conservation major, had a passion for music, the outdoors and people.
He caught a gator with a fishing pole, 
ditched class for a whole day to play the popular video game Rock Band and was 
an instant friend to all who met him. 
“He made me believe in miracles and 
never in coincidences,” said friend and 
fellow student Robert Lara. “He was al-ways happy to help and had a laugh for everything.” 
Chris Wolf, fellow wildlife ecology 
and conservation major, told the au-dience of how Owens, during a class 
project, dubbed their group the A-Team 
and picked an accompanying superhero theme song.   
“You just knew it was going to be a 
good time just ‘cause he was there,” Wolf said. 
Robert Lay, another friend, recounted a story of when he and Owens took a class trip to the Everglades. 
During the most miserable part of the 
trip, Owens kept the sweaty and tired group’s spirits up by spouting scientific names for plants and gastrointestinal functions, along with trying to fashion a 
new pair of shoes for a friend who’d lost 
his in the mud.
“Thad was the craziest guy you’ll 
ever meet,” Lay said, laughing and cry-ing simultaneously. “He was the best 
guy you’ll ever meet.” 
Amy Brown, a Rol-
lins College alumna who met Owens in 
high school, recalled 
how he decided to scale the outside of the Statue of Liberty dur-ing a class trip to New York City to the horror 
of her mother, who was chaperoning.
“Every memory with Thad is awe-
some,” Brown said. “Each is better and 
better.”
Owens’ memorial was coordinated 
with a ceremony in Namibia, Africa, 
where he was studying abroad with UF’s wildlife ecology and conservation de-partment. 
“We could all be a little more like 
Thad,” Reed said, his voice breaking. “Live more, give more and play harder.” 
The Owens family has set up a fund in 
their son’s honor through the University of Florida Foundation called the Thad H. Owens Wildlife Ecology Fund.
Owens’ body was found Saturday 
after being swept downstream while he 
was swimming in the Kunene River on 
Thursday in Namibia, Africa.Student remembered

The UF Health Troupe will host a scavenger 
hunt on Sunday to raise money for the Ameri-
can Diabetes Association.   
Teams of six to 10 students will complete a 
series of tasks in order to win prizes, such as 
signed Gator football jerseys, iPod shuffles and gift cards for local restaurants. 
The event will begin at noon at the Swamp 
Restaurant, where teams can pick up their hunt 
list. In past years, the list required participants 
to take a picture of their team napping in an in-
appropriate location, sitting on a conveyor belt 
in a grocery store and break dancing on a card-
board box. 
Hayley Rosen, a UF senior event manage-
ment major, organized the scavenger hunt this year for the American Diabetes Association. 
“[The participants] love the scavenger 
hunt,” Rosen said. “They enjoy going around 
Gainesville doing stuff they wouldn’t normally 
do, like duct taping a member to the wall.”
Participants will carry donation cans with 
them to different locations around 
Gainesville, and some of their tasks will in-corporate information on diabetes.   
The teams will submit photos of their com-
pleted tasks to Facebook before 7 p.m. and re-
turn to the Swamp Restaurant for a free concert, 
guest appearances from Gator athletes and the 
announcement of the winners.
Health Troupe, a UF student organization 
that raises awareness in the college commu-
nity about ways to prevent diseases through a 
healthy lifestyle, hopes to gather about 30 to 50 
teams on Sunday and raise about $5,000 for the 
American Diabetes Association.
The scavenger hunt is sponsored by Galigani 
Robertson Law Firm, University Club Apart-ments and the Swamp Restaurant. 
Students can register online for $10 at www.
theswamphunt.com.  LOCALGroup hopes to raise $5K 
for diabetes association

After her lover was shot by a fir-
ing squad, and she killed the man 
who tried to rape her, she jumped off a building.
This is the story of Giacomo 
Pucinni’s “Tosca” which will be performed by UF students, faculty and staff Thursday and Saturday in The Phillips Center for the Per-forming Arts.
“This is one of the most success-
ful and classic operas ever written,” said sophomore voice performance student Adelaide Boedecker.
Boedeker, who plays a peasant 
in the 7:30 p.m. performances, said “Tosca” is a story about two star-crossed lovers whose lives end in tragedy.
Set in Rome in the 1800s, “Tosca” is filled with love, jealousy, rape, hate and murder, she said.
The biggest key to a success-
ful performance is a collaborative 
effort, said the opera’s producer Tony Offerle.
Tony Mata, head of the musical 
theater department, is directing the 
performance while Stephen Thom-as, interim director of orchestra, and graduate student Matthew Wardell will conduct.
From the performers on stage, 
to the UF Symphony Orchestra, to the backstage crew and the light-ing technicians, there are 120 stu-dents in the production, he said.UF professor of voice Elizabeth 
Graham will perform the role of “Tosca.”
Graham, an award-winning 
singer, has taught at UF for 30 years, Offerle said.
Although “Tosca” is an Italian 
opera, there will be English sub-titles on a screen above the stage, he said.
“This is not your grandmother’s 
opera,” Offerle said. 
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack 
Obama and his wife, Michelle, millionaires 
from his best-selling books, made $2.7 million last year and paid just under one-third of their adjusted income in federal taxes.
While the income, mostly his, was far more 
than the U.S. median household income of about $50,000, it was quite a decrease from the $4.2 million the Obamas made in 2007.Both years, nearly all of the earnings came 
from Obama’s best-selling books. “Dreams 
from My Father” and “The Audacity of Hope” 
— brought in about $2.5 million in royalties last year, according to copies of the returns re-leased by the White House on Wednesday, the federal filing deadline.
Obama earned $139,204 as a Democratic 
senator from Illinois last year before leaving his seat after winning the November election. Michelle Obama received a salary of $62,709 from the University of Chicago Hospitals, where she was an executive.
The couple’s total federal tax came to 
$855,323. That was 32 percent of their adjusted 
gross income of $2,656,902.
The Obamas overpaid by 
$26,014, and elected to apply that amount to their 2009 taxes.
The couple’s federal tax 
deductions included about $50,000 in home mortgage interest. Their expenses also includ-ed $47,488 to send their two daughters to the University of Chicago’s elementary school.
They reported contributing $172,050 to 
charity last year, including $25,000 each to the CARE international relief agency and the United Negro College Fund. That $172,050 represented about 6.5 percent of the family’s adjusted gross income. That percentage is roughly two to three times the national aver-age for household donations to charity, ac-cording to Indiana University. AROunD g AInES vIllE

What do a steaming plate of chicken and a 
sexy woman have in common?
Nothing, if you ask Carol Adams, author of 
“The Sexual Politics of Meat,” but the media 
often portrays otherwise, she said.
In her slide show presentation Wednesday, 
Adams, a self-labeled “vegan, feminist agita-
tor for peace,” discussed the link between sex-
ism and meat through advertisements, news 
articles and even children’s homework. About 100 people attended the talk.Adams, who has written over 100 articles 
and 20 books, said she feels “inequality is 
made sexy” in images depicting women as 
enticing meat entrées, such as a Gap T-shirt 
where a naked woman is drawn with butcher lines next to the caption, “What’s your cut?”
“The images elicit the same snickers, the 
same jokes, except men don’t have to admit 
they’re putting women down,” she said.
Some of the more graphic images in the 
slide show, such as a hanging row of disem-
bodied cow heads in a meat-packing facility, 
elicited shocked moans from the audience.
Leah Goldberg, an agricultural and food science major at Santa Fe College, said she found a Louis Vuitton advertisement show-ing a woman’s red-stiletto’d leg hanging from 
a rope around her ankle 
equally disturbing. 
The image is disturbing 
because it depicts abuse 
to women as lighthearted 
in addition to likening the 
woman to a slab of meat, 
Adams said.
“I can’t believe some-
thing like that is fashionable,” Goldberg said.                                   
 William Bowers, an English professor at SFC, encouraged his students to attend Ad-
ams’ presentation because it applied to many of the feminist and culinary themes studied 
throughout the semester.         
“A lot of them are frustrated, but in a way 
that’s interesting and healthy,” Bowers said of 
his students after the presentation.  
Adams said she encouraged the audience 
to stop eating animals and “stop consuming women,” along with being more critical of the media and the underlying sexist ideas it may contain.
“Perhaps you, too, can see ads differently,” 
she said. ON CAMPUS
Author discusses link between meat and sexism
near the core of campus, he said, from the 
Reitz Union North Lawn to Little Hall.
The story was the same in each case, he 
said. 
“Every one of them involved the bug,” 
he said.
“There’s no real differentiation between 
any of these cases,” he said. “It’s really quite odd.” 
In Tuesday’s incident, which happened 
around 8:20 p.m., Garg allegedly told the student she had a bug on her and then start-ed touching her, telling her he was remov-ing the bug, according to UPD. He then put 
his hand under the student’s shirt without 
her consent.
The student, along with several other 
witnesses, called UPD, Baxley said.Officers caught up with Garg about 20 
minutes later as he was walking near Tur-lington Hall, Baxley said.
He said UPD was able to nab Garg so 
quickly because the department already had several undercover officers in the area attempting to catch him in the act.
A master’s student in computer and in-
formation science and engi-
neering, 
Garg came to UF in the 
fall of 2008 from Maharshi 
Dayanand University in India, according to 
UF spokesman Steve Orlando.
Garg was booked at the Alachua County 
Jail Tuesday night, with bond set at $5,000. Chris Loschiavo, director of UF’s Student Conduct and Conflict Resolution, said he 
couldn’t comment on whether Garg might 
face sanctions from UF, citing student pri-vacy rules.Bond for groper set at $5,000
cerns of the business community, he felt 
that the portion of the community who voted for Charter Amendment 1 in the March elections are not being heard.
The amendment would have re-
moved the anti-discrimination chapter of the ordinance.
Minck said he wants the commis-
sion to acknowledge the state statute that allows businesses to designate and enforce separate restrooms for men and women.
“We never wanted a person who’s 
transgendered to not be able to get a job or get kicked out of their house,” he said. “It was the public accommoda-
tions provision that had this self-defini-
tion that allowed a man to walk up to a woman’s restroom and say, ‘I’m going in there because I have the inner sense of being a woman.’”Revised ordinance would include 
exemption for shared facilities

The word “sex” always 
emits a hint of excitement, a 
bit of blushing and a tingling 
feeling of anticipation. But 
there’s no question it sounds 
better—and far sexier—in 
another language. 
As we embark on our 
summer breaks, it’s time for 
study abroad trips, far-away 
internships and family va -
cations. And although the 
economy may be suffering, 
sex is one thing the dollar 
doesn’t effect. 
Here in America, sex is 
almost a forbidden act, a 
secret activity discussed in 
hushed voices and whis -
pers and thought of as 
shameful by many. It’s a 
private thing in this country 
where kisses can’t be shared 
in public and butt grabs are 
forbidden. 
Public displays of affection 
are gawked at and avoided 
so often that the letters PDA 
are even used as excuses for 
couples afraid of showing 
their love for each other to 
anyone but themselves. 
But in other countries, 
benches, subway cars, street 
cafés and museum steps are 
completely acceptable places 
for acts of affection.  
As we pack our bags, our 
itineraries may be packed 
full of the top tourist places, 
the best-rated restaurants 
and even the most exclusive boutiques. But with the eco -
nomic turmoil rain cloud 
hovering over everyone’s va -
cation plans, it’s probably a 
good idea to take a less steep 
and more sexy sidetrack.
Whip off your swim 
trunks and untie your bikini. 
It’s time to bare all. There’s 
nothing like letting the sun 
shine on your sexy summer 
body, and I mean all of it. 
There are plenty of nude 
beaches all over the world, 
but a top one is Playa de Es 
Cavallet in Ibiza, Spain. It’s 
about a mile long with roll -
ing dunes of natural sand 
and an endless strip of disco 
bars and restaurants. 
You don’t have to pay to 
take your clothes off, but the 
drink prices may be steep, so 
don’t forget to bring along 
the beloved flask you regu -
larly sneak into midtown 
bars. The alcohol may loosen 
you up, letting you strut your 
stripped sexiness with confi -
dence and could even lead 
you to flirt your way into a 
Spanish cabana. 
Getting naked not your 
thing? Well, there’s nothing 
wrong with looking at other 
naked people. I’m not talk -
ing porn—this isn’t America, 
where we have to hide be -
hind our laptop screens to 
get our fix. Le Musée de L’érotisme, 
or the Erotic Museum, lies 
in one of the sexiest cities in 
the world, Paris, and it is just 
steps away from the Moulin 
Rouge. The museum features 
artifacts, paintings and, yes, 
photographs, of all things 
erotic. And with a discount 
voucher you can print off-
line, a trip will only cost you 
three euro (about five dol -
lars).

longer and you’re visiting

tels. They are little huts on 
the street corner prepared 
and cleaned for ‘pay by the 
hour’ sexfests. 
And who could forget the 
ever-famous Amsterdam, 
the red-light district where 
women pose nude behind 
windows and are offered on 
the menu at restaurants and 
bars? But some sexy shops 
might be pretty pricey, as 
some sex clubs can charge 
you up to 75 euro an hour. 
So, whether you’ll be 
stripping in the sand, sexily 
staring or paying for your 
fun, try to seize the sexy 
summer, because it only lasts 
three months. Though sex 
isn’t something we fear in 
Gainesville, not everyone in 
this town is as comfortable 
with it as other cultures are. 
As for now, I bid you 
adieu. Let the summer lovin’ 
begin.ASHLEY ROSS  � AVENUE WRITER
And although the economy 
may be suffering, sex is 
one thing the dollar doesn’t
 effect.““Fashion and street-style blogs 
are usually based in big cities where 
fashion has a heavy presence, and the 
style savvy roam the streets and make 
it easy for bloggers to click their cam -
eras and post the pictures for all the 
world to see. 
Based in Gainesville, the Tonnish 
Touch, www.tonnishtouch.blogspot.
com, authors Leah Southers and Fla -
via Cervantes capture fashionable 
residents, as well as feature trends 
they are interested in. 
“Gainesville’s fashion community 
is more hidden,” said Cervantes, a 
second-year marketing major. “How -
ever, it definitely ex -
ists and is rapidly 
growing. That is what 
is so fun about blog -
ging in Gainesville; 
Leah and I are con -
stantly on the look -
out for cuties roam -
ing around campus 
or on the streets. “
Southers and Cervantes have been 
blogging since September 2008. Af -
ter spending so much time on other 
fashion blogs and looking at designer 
Web sites, starting the Tonnish Touch 
was the next logical step. The blog al -
lows them to express their personal 
styles and tastes and react to other 
bloggers and editorials. 
“We were always coming across 
beautiful things online that we want -
ed to share with other people, not 
just one another, “ said Southers, a 
third-year public relations major. 
“Gainesville is an unexpected city for 
a fashion blog, but contrary to popu -
lar thought, there’s a thriving fashion 
culture here.”
Cervantes said she pulls inspira -tion from other blogs such as “Who 
What Wear Daily” and “Mademoi -
selle Robot” more often than from 
magazine editorials because the blog -
gers provide a more realistic way 
to wear the clothes and provide the 
answer to the question, “How would 
that look on a normal person?”
Southers also uses the blog for 
personal inspiration, and says even 
though the Tonnish Touch does not 
focus on personal outfit posts, they 
never post anything they would not 
wear. 
“We’re not really that picky with 
what we choose. We blog separate -
ly, so when we see 
something we like 
while lurking blogs, 
we’ll repost it or just 
post pictures of shoes 
or headbands or de -
signers we like,” she 
said. “I’d wear ev -
erything I post (and 
wish I could afford to) because I only 
post what I like.”
The blog to them is a form of per -
sonal expression and an outlet for 
ideas. Even if there is a trend they 
like but cannot afford, such as Chris -
tian Louboutin sandals, the girls will 
publish a “lust” post because after all, 
every girl can dream.
For the summer, they look forward 
to wearing high-waisted shorts, floral 
skirts and embellished sandals, which 
according to Southers’ last post, she is 
willing to splurge on. 
“I love sandals that are on the bor -
der of being ‘too much’ with hard -
ware, ankle straps, studs, you name 
it,” said Cervantes, who hopes to pair 
the sandals with ruffled dresses and 
floral skirts.THURSDAY, APRIL 16, 2009 � ALLIGATOR , 13
with cast members of MTV’s “College Life”
What happens in college often 
tends to stay in college. 
It is an outlet for freedom 
where parents and the other folks 
back home are unaware of that 
party from last night, that hook -
up from the night before or that 
mental breakdown an hour ago. 
“College Life,” a new series 
that premiered Monday on MTV, 
has changed this freedom. 
Four students attending school 
in Madison, Wis., were equipped 
with camcorders to tape their 
freshman years without produc -
ers, cameramen and directors. 
Here is an interview with two 
of the cast members, Jordan, 19, 
and Kevin, 18, on their reaction 
to their lives away from home ex -
posed to the world. 
Q: What went through your 
mind when you first began filming 
yourself? 
K: How absolutely awkward it was carrying a video camera and 
having to talk into it around peo -
ple. It was one little camcorder, 
not even state of the art. I never 
had any experience with one, so 
it was pretty much a homemade 
video of me and my buddies. I 
have been doing it for almost six 
and half months now, so after the 
first month it became second na -
ture.
 J: To be honest, I was a bit 
uncomfortable with the camera 
first. I didn’t know what to shoot 
or was well-versed in the produc -
tion of it. It got easier over time. 
Q: Was it hard for you to stay 
true to who you are?
K: Unfortunately for my par -
ents, I did not hold back at all. 
I put a lot of faith into the edi -
tors. There is definitely going to 
be things I regret or things that 
happen that I am prone to re -
gret. That’s reality. Whoever has gone to the college can connect to 
some of the things that are going 
on and some of the things I’m not 
too proud to show my parents, 
and that’s college for ya. 
J: I have a good sense of who I 
am. I’m not too nervous because 
I am not really fazed by the type 
of people who 
would pass 
judgment on me 
without meeting 
me. If you are 
that type of per -
son, I don’t real -
ly care about be -
ing your friend.
Q: Are you afraid of your par -
ents’ or others reaction to the 
show?
K: They always have their 
concerns. They know I like to 
have good time. They have seen 
a couple clips of it, and my mom 
had a couple of problems. I show my uncut personal life to 
my parents. Honestly, I would be 
perfectly content with all of this 
if my grandparents, parents and 
little brother weren’t watching 
it. But I’m just going to have to 
get used to my parents knowing 
about my social life.
J:  Everything that I recorded 
on camera I feel I am comfortable 
with my parents seeing and the 
community seeing. If you want to 
judge me off this television show, 
I don’t understand how people 
who know me for my whole life, 
for 18 years, change their judg -
ment of me from how I am per -
ceived on this show. 
Q: Do you think this reality show 
is impacted because the produc -
ers, director and cameramen are 
taken away? 
K: It is definitely a lot more un -
censored, a lot more real. Some -
times it would be a lot easier with 
a crew around. It is MTV. It is not the Discovery Channel. 
J: MTV did a great job giving 
me guidelines, telling me what 
was good for TV. It got easier 
overtime. They never really sug -
gested activities for me to do or 
ever pressure me into doing any -
thing. 
Basically what they wanted is 
if you start a story, they want an 
end to it. They didn’t give spe -
cific things to film. 
Q: What has this experience 
taught you? 
K: With the filming aspect, 
the one thing I’m going to have 
to worry about is growing thick 
skin. There is definitely going to 
be a couple of things I’m not too 
proud of but it happens. 
J: My family was never big on 
home videos. I have always been 
really intrigued by documenting 
your life. This is just such a good 
opportunity to do that.MARY MANCHESS
AVENUE WRITER
The circus is coming to 
town, ladies and gentleman, 
but this one doesn’t have 
a thing to do with Britney 
Spears. 
Saltimbanco, a Cirque du 
Soleil arena touring show, 
will perform for the first 
time in Gainesville from 
May 7 to May 10 at the 
O’Connell Center. 
Saltimbanco comes from 
Italian “saltare in banco,” 
which literally translates “to 
jump on a bench,” and cre -
ative director Carmen Ruest 
said the show was created 
to push people to jump to 
another bench, to go further 
in life. 
“It’s a metaphor to say 
don’t be afraid to try some -
thing else, to go somewhere 
else if you have to feeling, 
just go for discovery,” she 
said. “It can be positive and 
can bring you a lot more 
than you thought.”
Ruest said Saltimbanco is 
one of the best shows to ex -
perience because it is visu -
ally clear and pleasing. 
Featuring amusing acts, 
outlandish characters and 
audience participation, it’s 
a great show for everybody, 
said head coach Michael 
Ocampo. 
It started in 1992 and is 
currently the longest-run -
ning Cirque du Soleil show.
It has fewer technical el -
ements because of its age, so its simplicity makes the 
story easy to figure out. 
The concept of evolution 
is universal and timeless, 
which is why it’s lasted so 
long.
“There’s 
no referral 
to time at 
all,” Ruest 
said. 
“ B u t 
we do still 
have the 
c o s t u m e s 
in lycra.”
The staging represents 
urbanism and is set like an 
imaginary park full of vi -
brant colored lighting and 
even more eye-catching cos -
tumes. 
The costumes are fash -
ioned specifically to charac -
ter as each emerges through -
out the development of the 
show. 
In 1991, a new color chart 
was developed, allowing the 
Cirque team to design bril -
liantly vibrant and bright 
costumes with primary col -
ors. 
And though there won’t 
be any elephants in the ring, 
there will be nine high-level 
acrobatic acts that relate to 
the themes of the show. 
For example, Peruvian 
juggling is a tribute to what 
many juggle in their every -
day lives. 
But there will also be a duo trapeze, which Ru -
est calls “so dangerous,” 
an acrobatic leaping act on 
Chinese poles representing 
skyscrapers; a solo bicycle 
act unlike any ordinary bike 
ride in the park; a Russian 
swing act where characters 
will fly on their imaginary 
playground up to 30 feet in 
the air; and a gravity-defy -
ing bungee performance 
“like four little white birds” 
to conclude the show. 
All of the acts are per -
formed to a wide range of 
elegant music from funky 
to opera, which musical cre -
ator Rene Dupere said will 
give rise to different emo -
tions in each spectator. 
Ruest started working 
with Saltimbanco in 1996 af -
ter spending her time on La 
Nouba, the Cirque show in 
Orlando. 
In 2007, Saltimbanco was 
reconfigured for large are -
nas, and its new tour will 
stop in about 40 cities each 
year to spread its message 
of pushing the barrier. 
“How will it leave the 
audience?” Ruest asked. 
“I hope that they will go 
back home with a new light 
in their head and a beauti -
ful smile, and that they will 
feel that all dreams are pos -
sible.”
Tickets are about $30 to 
$80 for adults and $24 to $64 
dollars for children.Saltimbanco pushes barriers

Mosh pits and skanking aren’t 
usually associated with helping 
the needy. 
However, an assortment of 
hardcore, punk, reggae and ska 
bands are using their music to 
help a local cause. Eighteen local 
bands will perform a series of CD 
release shows through June that 
will raise funds and more aware -
ness about HOMEvan, a grass -
roots volunteer-outreach organi -
zation that provides services to 
the homeless. 
The CD is a second compi -
lation entitled “HOMEvan: A 
Gainesville Music Benefit for the 
Homeless.” Twenty-four bands, 
along with the 18 that are per -
forming, are featured on the 
CD. Some of them include Chu -
paskabra, The Duppies, Morn -
ingbell and Oh Sanders.  
“For the musicaholics in 
this town, it’s great because 
Gainesville is a really tight music 
community,” said Dan Fitzpat -rick, one of the show’s organiz -
ers. “This town is really progres -
sive in that the Gainesville music 
scene is willing to come out for 
some really neat causes.”
The next show is April 26 at 
Common Grounds featuring Gra -
bass Charlestons, Liquid Limbs, 
Spanish Gamble and Crash Pad. 
Doors open at 5 p.m., and orga -
nizers are asking for a $5 to $20 
donation.
 They are also asking attend -
ees to bring either a jar of peanut 
butter or a pair of white socks for 
distribution. According to Fitz -
patrick, the items are what the 
homeless community has said it 
needs the most. 
Clean socks were requested 
because they tend to get worn 
out easily, especially in the rain. 
Peanut butter, because it is non -
perishable and highly nutritious. 
“A lot of people see this town 
as just the four-year layover be -
tween high school and real life,” Fitzpatrick said. “There is more 
going on in this town than the 
bubble of school and midtown 
bars; there is a whole community 
going on here.”
 The CD’s 
price is on a slid -
ing scale of $7 to 
$20. It is available 
at all four shows 
and also at Hyde 
‘n Zeke Records 
and Wayward 
Council. All sales 
will also go to 
HOMEvan’s efforts to relieve the 
growing homeless population in 
Gainesville.
According to the Alachua 
County Coalition for the Home -
less and Hungry, the number of 
women, men and children with -
out homes has jumped about 70 
percent. 
HOMEvan helps 100 to 300 
of these people twice a week by 
bringing them food, clothes and hygiene products.  
The first CD and benefit show 
of this kind was put together for 
HOMEvan back in 2002. It fea -
tured 42 bands, and overall raised 
$3,000 for HOMEvan, which Fitz -
patrick hopes to top this year.   
Fitzpatrick 
brought the 
idea back to life 
after he visited 
his best friend 
for the summer 
who was in the 
Peace Corp in 
Mongolia.  He 
said his friend told him he should 
try to reorganize a benefit show 
and compilation CD for HOM -
Evan again because it was such a 
great idea.   
“I felt the biggest tragedy of 
the first one was it was such a 
good idea and it didn’t pick up,” 
Fitzpatrick said. “We are hoping 
this really grows legs, gains some 
momentum and becomes a regu -
lar thing.” 
When he talked to bands about the idea, he said they raved about 
it.  
Brian Hiebel, the lead singer of 
The Duppies, said while the band 
has done a lot of benefit shows, 
he enjoys using his music for hu -
manitarian causes a lot more. 
“I don’t always like giving out 
my spare change,” he said.  “But 
I definitely like contributing my 
artistic ability to something like 
this.” 
Hiebel and The Duppie’s gui -
tarist Tony Farah both said they 
like seeing the cause affect their 
own community. 
“With how much I’m out, and 
how many homeless people I see 
on a daily basis, it’s cool to help 
them,” Farah said. 
Farah, who is also the bassist 
of Chupaskabra, said he hopes 
the benefit compilation will have 
an influence on the fans. 
“As far as our fans, most kids 
that come out are pretty young,” 
he said. “Hopefully this exposes 
them to the cause and new mu -
sic.”Bands unite, create album to benefit the homeless
As if trying to make it at 
20-something isn’t challeng -
ing already, our economy is in 
a dangerous position and the 
majority of economists predict 
it will not improve anytime 
soon. 
“I’m not going to sugar-
coat this — times are really 
tough right now and there’s 
great uncertainty,” “Rich by 
Thirty” author Lesley Scorgie 
explains. 
“There is hope,” she adds, 
“markets are cyclical, they go 
up and down and times like 
this have happened before.”
Strive for wealth; it will 
give you freedom and a sense 
of stability even in our chal -
lenging economy. 
Create a budget: Financial 
experts agree that before cut -
ting costs and clipping cou -
pons, it is crucial to first track 
where exactly every cent is go -
ing. Spend a good week or two 
and write down every single 
expense — $3.74 for a latte, 
$8.50 for lunch, etc. 
Keep track of daily expens -
es, whether you jot down all 
expenses in a notebook or sim -
ply hang on to every receipt. 
“Living Rich for Less” author 
Ellie Kay says that a budget 
will ultimately be a road map 
for finding a cheaper, smarter 
way to do everything. 
Out of the red, into the 
Green:  While times are tough, 
it is still crucial to tackle all of 
the credit card debt you can. 
For example, if you’re carrying 
a $10,000 balance on a credit 
card with 11 percent interest, 
which is a pretty average rate, you’re paying at least $1,000 in 
interest annually. It is possible 
to focus on small, consistent 
payments with a reduced in -
terest rate. 
With a lower APR and con -
sistent payments, creditors 
will appreciate that you are 
“diligently working to pay 
above the minimum,” Scorgie 
explains. 
Entertain yourself:  Really, 
Kay says if you do not “bud -
get for fun,” your budget is 
bound to fail. Start by allotting 
a certain amount and keeping 
that in cash 
in your wal -
let. This will 
give you an 
excellent vi -
sual to see 
just how fast 
a $3.79 latte 
will add up. 
Also, when dining out, visit 
restaurant.com, which will 
give regional specials. Recent -
ly Kay found a $25 gift certifi -
cate to her favorite pizza place 
on there — for $2. 
Another suggestion is to 
monitor travelzoo.com, which 
will give you amazing deals – 
like an $899 cruise Kay went 
on with her husband. She paid 
$199 and insists this was no 
“bait and switch” and almost 
all of the other passengers on -
board paid the full price. 
Go green, save green: 
Make a few small tweaks in 
your daily routine that are not 
only good for the budget but 
equally awesome for sustain -
ability. You can easily lower 
your utility bill in two simple ways. First, Scorgie suggests 
only washing clothes in cold 
water. Another plus: Cold wa -
ter is better for maintaining 
fabric. 
Second, properly seal your 
doors and windows to keep 
cool air in and humidity out. 
Doors and windows can have 
a copious flow of air where 
even the slightest gaps exist. 
Shop, but online:  The 
20-something set shops on -
line more than any other de -
mographic, according to Kay. 
Continue to purchase electron -
ics and other 
items online 
and “layer the 
savings,” Kay 
explains. First, 
go to a Shop -
ping Robot 
online — such 
as FatWallet.
com — that will search for your 
specified item to find who has 
it for the lowest price. 
Then, add free shipping or 
other incentives to your order 
from that seller by going to 
couponcabin.com or dealhunt -
ing.com, which will provide 
promo codes used at your 
checkout. Now that you have 
the lowest price with free ship -
ping, Kay recommends you go 
to ebates.com and access thou -
sands of rebates offered that 
many shoppers don’t know 
about! 
Speak Up In-Store:  No mat -
ter how tough times get, wom -
en are still shopping, explains 
Mary Hall, The Recessionista 
blogger. “And never pay retail 
prices, ever,” Hall commands. If you loathe online shopping 
and find pleasure in perus -
ing racks of clothing amidst 
screaming children in shop -
ping malls, ask and you shall 
receive, Scorgie, author of 
“Rich by Thirty,” explains. 
At the Nordstrom flagship 
store, Scorgie described eying 
a $450 Coach bag. Interested in 
it, she asked the sales associate 
what is on sale and if the cov -
eted bag would ever be. “She 
told me to come back the next 
day, and there it was, $175.” In 
this tough economy, retailers 
predict they will continue to 
slash prices and hold sales, so 
speak up and shop on. 
The Web is a Wonderland:  
Hall admired a $500 crochet 
Jovavivch Hawk dress for 
almost a year at Fred Segal 
in L.A. Her patience finally 
paid off when she purchased 
the coveted dress for $50. So 
maybe you do not have a year 
to wait — Hall still says us -
ing web sites like Bluefly.com, 
where you find the $565 Gucci 
Powder Patent Leather Crest 
Pumps listed for $452. 
Also, sign up for Google 
alerts to get updates on your 
favorite designers and sales. 
Additionally, a quick Google 
search for the store or design -
er name and the word “cou -
pon” can turn up wonders, 
“The Budgeting Babe” blogger 
Dianna Baros explains. Both 
bloggers agree that eBay is a 
great resource, but they also 
recommend monitoring blogs 
like theirs where they are con -
stantly updating sale informa -
tion and offering coupons for 
readers.MARY MANCHESS  � AVENUE WRITER

 Author of “Living Rich for 
Less”““■An open letter to advertisers 
of Scion automobiles
Dear Scion commercials,
Why do you hate me? Why do 
you make angry robot noises at me? 
I was just watching television! 
Alright, I knew I should have 
been studying, but come on. I mean, 
I know you’re trying to market to 
young, cool kids who listen to “elec -
tro” and stuff, but even they think 
you’re coming on too strong with 
that ungodly cacophony of bleeps 
and whizzes.
I’m only saying this because 
you’re special to me, but look, your 
cars just aren’t very cool. The Mazda 
Miata looks baller compared to you. 
You’re going for that urban, tech -
nological look, I know, but are peo -
ple really into that stuff enough to 
have it reflect in their car? 
I’m not saying that you can’t 
change your game either, but you 
know, adding some “customized” 
stripes and some punk-ass rims is 
not really helping anything. 
But good effort out there -- just 
pick up the hustle. Or put on some 
Glenn Miller Orchestra and adver -
tise with what you’ve got.
And just so you know, the Toby 
Keith Ford commercials and I are 
seeing each other now. Please stop 
calling.Scion ap -

By ANTHONY CHIANG
Alligator Writer
After Tyson Alexander beat his dad for 
the first time, he rushed inside the house 
and turned the monkey. 
“I turned the monkey around, and that 
was all that was said,” Tyson recalled with a smile on his face.
That solidified his name in the family tra-
dition.
The ceramic monkey, which was origi-
nally a birthday present to his grandfather, Skip, acts as the family trophy.
It is shared among Tyson, his grandfather 
and his father, UF men’s golf coach Buddy Alexander.
The one-foot-tall ceramic monkey sits on 
a shelf. When Buddy wins, it faces the wall. When Tyson wins, it shows its face.
Along with the trophy, a love for the 
game of golf has been passed down the bloodline.
That love started with Skip, who played 
on two USA Ryder Cup teams.
Then it continued to Buddy, the 1986 U.S. 
Amateur champion. 
Now it has reached Tyson, who has 
played in all but one of the UF men’s golf team’s tournaments this season.
Who’s Your Caddy?
Although golf ran deep in Tyson’s blood, 
it wasn’t always the only sport he focused on.
He split his time between basketball and 
golf in his freshman and sophomore years at Gainesville’s Buchholz High before he abruptly decided to leave the basketball team. Tyson decided to use his junior year as a break from basketball in order to focus on golf.
The break was a short one.He took a basketball class as a senior, 
which tempted him to return to the team.
When the Buchholz basketball coach 
noticed Tyson’s eagerness to return to the hardwood, he asked Buddy if Tyson could make a return to the team.
Despite Buddy’s preference for golf, he 
allowed his son to make the decision.
After much deliberation between the 
two, Tyson decided to juggle the two sports during his final year of high school. 
“I don’t regret it. It was really fun,” he 
said. “I like being on a team. Sometimes in a golf tournament you miss that.”
But in the end, Buddy knew basketball 
was not in his son’s future. 
“He loved both sports, and I think early 
on he understood that he was not going to be a college basketball player, but that he did have a chance to be a pretty decent golf-er,” Buddy said.
As a two-sport athlete in high school, Ty-
son built a hard-headed, can-do-no-wrong attitude as one of the big men on the Buch-holz campus. 
The U.S. Amateur Championship was 
evidence of that.
Tyson qualified for the prestigious tour-
nament as a high school junior, one of the few events where he was allowed to have a caddy.
He knew his father would assume that 
role from the start.
In the second round of the tournament, 
Tyson shot two bogeys on the 10th and 11th holes, putting him in the dispiriting position of not qualifying for match play.
Already bitter from the previous two 
holes, he discussed his club selection with his caddy on the 12th hole.
After the talk, he took his father’s advice and used the lesser club.
As Tyson started his motion and cocked 
back to hit the ball, his father watched.
The golf club met the ball, but not with 
enough force. The ball fell short into the bunker, sparking an argument between the two.
“Nice club,” Tyson said sarcastically.Bothered by his son’s lack of accountabil-
ity, Buddy fired back.
“You hit that ball a little bit fat, and if you 
can’t be accountable, then I’m not going to caddy for you,” Buddy said. “Do you want to carry your own bag?”
Tyson accepted the offer and finished the 
round by himself.
After being fired by his 
son, Buddy refused to follow him, opting to check out some of his re-cruiting prospects.
Once the round was over, Tyson avoided 
his dad’s reaction to the incident and went back to the hotel with his mother.
The next morning at breakfast, Buddy 
approached his son to talk about the previ-ous day’s events.
Their conversation was short. Before his 
father could even begin, Tyson admitted he was wrong.
“I hit it fat,” he said.With that four-word sentence, the hard-
headed kid who could do no wrong learned how to accept defeat.
Since then, Buddy has attempted to cad-
dy for his son a few more times with more successful results.
Homeward Bound
While most high school seniors look for-
ward to escaping their parents, Tyson never even considered leaving home.
He didn’t have to, either. In his junior year of high school, he 
participated in the Junior Heritage tourna-ment as an unranked golfer.
Despite Tyson’s position as an underdog, 
he finished in the middle of the pack in a tournament composed of top-ranked play-ers. 
These results didn’t surprise Buddy, who 
expected this from his son.
On the drive home from Tyson’s impres-
sive performance, Buddy brought up a sub-ject they had avoided so far: college.
“I’m going to have about four or five days 
where I can take you to take a look at some colleges,” Buddy said to Tyson. “I’ve talked to those coaches about you, and they seem to be interested in having you on their teams, if 
you want to get out of Gainesville.”
In high school, 
Tyson received letters of inter-
est from various colleges, including 
Alabama and Tennessee, but he never took an official visit to any school.
“I think that would be a waste of time,” 
Tyson replied.
With that, Buddy had successfully re-
cruited his son. Because Tyson had been around the UF golf program for most of his life, he knew what to expect from his father as soon as he chose to attend.
Even his mother, Jane, never questioned 
where her son would end up for college.
“Deep down in his mind, he knew that 
Florida and learning from his dad was where he wanted to be,” Jane said. “I think it was always Florida.”
After reflecting on the recruitment of his 
son, Buddy realized he didn’t have to offi-cially offer Tyson a spot to sway him to stay in Gainesville. He considers his son the easi-est recruit he ever influenced to commit.
While the father-and-son connection 
might have helped Tyson land at UF, it hasn’t helped him since he arrived.
If he didn’t call his coach “Dad,” no one would be able to tell they were related.
Now finishing up his third year at UF un-
der his father, Tyson said he has never been given any preferential treatment.
Tyson might not admit that Buddy is 
harder on him than the rest of the golfers on the team, but he will confess that his father isn’t easier on him.
His teammate and roommate, Will Strick-
ler, agreed. 
“I don’t see any favoritism anywhere,” 
Strickler said. “He probably treats him a little tougher, if anything.”
While Buddy admits he is a lot more criti-
cal of his son than the rest of the team, he doesn’t believe it bothers Tyson.
“I can needle with him a little differently, 
and I know he’s going to get it,” Buddy said. “That’s just a normal father-and-son thing.”
Looking Toward the Future
As Tyson works toward a successful fu-
ture in golf, he says he will carry the past with him.
“I remember growing up, I would always 
follow my dad around in the Gator Invita-tional and always want to play in it,” he said. “I remember thinking to myself that I could play in this tournament one day, and it’s pretty cool that it has come true.”
As for the monkey, it is still facing out-
ward, a sign that it’s Tyson’s turn to continue the family’s dominance on the golf course.
At 56 years old, Buddy admits it is only 
getting harder to contend for the statue.
“It’s getting a little tougher for me,” Bud-
dy said. “He is getting better, and I’m get-ting older.”
Tyson agreed with his father.“I’m always going to have it,” Tyson said 
with a smile on his face.
After hearing such assured remarks from 
his son, Buddy was quick to retract his ear-lier statement. The Alexander competitive-ness prevailed.
“We’ll have to see about that,” Buddy 
said.a family affair

Nothing to lose. It’s cliché.
But in the case of the UF gymnastics team, 
it’s the honest-to-goodness truth. 
With only eight healthy gymnasts, the 
team has already cemented itself as one of the 
top 12 in the country, having advanced to the 
NCAA Championships, which start today at 2 p.m. in Lincoln, Neb.
“You wait all year for it, and when it fi-
nally comes it’s like, ‘Wow, I can’t believe it’s already here,’” junior Courtney Gladys said.
The Gators, competing in Session 1 against 
No. 1 Georgia, No. 5 LSU, No. 8 Oklahoma, No. 9 Stanford and No. 12 Penn State, will 
hope to carry their momentum and finish as 
one of the top three teams in their session.
If that happens, they advance to the Super 
Six, where they have a shot to become the na-tional champs.
The team drew floor exercise first for 
Thursday, following the same routine as in the NCAA Regional Championships on April 4.
“Whatever (event) we start on, it’s fine,” 
junior Maranda Smith said. “You’re going to have to do them all anyway.”
UF lost to Georgia both times this season, 
once in Athens, Ga., and again at the South-eastern Conference Championships. While the Gators dropped their meet at LSU, they topped the Tigers at the SEC Championships. UF beat Oklahoma to open the season, fresh 
on the heels of the other Gators win against 
the Sooners this year — the BCS National Championship Game. 
While other schools may be feeling the 
heat of the national spotlight, members of the UF gymnastics team insist they’re just having fun. 
After all, the team is only eight deep. Who 
can take a team with eight gymnasts seri-
ously?
“We know we’re limited,” senior Corey 
Hartung said. “But I think that has helped us 
tremendously, just pulling together more and fighting more for every routine. We peaked at the right time.”Hartung pointed out that the Gators, who 
had only seven healthy gymnasts at the time, were — from the team’s standpoint — over-looked at the SEC Championships.
The conference has five teams at the 
NCAA Championships, including defending champion Georgia, and it’s hard to argue the 
SEC is not the toughest conference in gym-
nastics. 
Still, the Gators managed a third-place fin-
ish. And then, with eight gymnasts, the team corralled a win in the NCAA North Central Regionals, perhaps pitied by other teams be-cause of its injury plight.
“Just hearing that is awful,” Hartung said. 
“It feels good to prove people wrong.”UF coach Rhonda Faehn believes her team 
is ready mentally and physically to compete in similar fashion as the last two meets. She credited the competition at the SEC Champi-onships and NCAA Regional with preparing UF for the national championship.
“They have gone out and done above and 
beyond at SECs and regionals,” Faehn said. “I know they’re going to go out there and do the exact same thing at nationals and have a 
blast.”
Smith, who is eyeing her first All-America 
title and hopes to be an All-American on all-
around, vault, uneven bars and floor, said the team has proven itself during the last month and that even with the team’s third- and first-place finishes, respectively, there is room for improvement.
The grim reality, though, is that the Gators 
can only field eight gymnasts. But there is a slight positive to be found in that.
“We haven’t put the extreme pressure  (on 
ourselves) that we have in the years past,” Gladys said. “It’s certainly helped us to our advantage this year.”

■ THE FULLBACK HAD BEEN 
IMPRESSING URBAN MEYER DURING SPRING PRACTICE.
By mIKE mccaLL
Alligator Staff Writer
mmccall@alligator.org
UF fullback Steven Wilks will 
likely miss the 2009 season after 
suffering a torn ACL.
“He’ll have surgery in about 
two weeks,” coach Urban Meyer said. 
“It’s a shame because he’s do-ing great. We maybe still hope 
he can play next year a little bit, 
and then he has two years left af-ter that. He’s one of the most im-proved guys on the team.”
Two weeks ago, Meyer was 
complaining about the poor per-formance of his fullbacks, Wilks and T.J. Pridemore. But his tone completely changed soon after. 
He has since praised them and 
their importance in the I-forma-tion, which the Gators began ex-perimenting with this spring.
NELSON TAKES ON COACH-LIKE 
ROLE: Receiver David Nelson is finding the positives in the ankle 
injury that has kept him sidelined 
during spring practice. 
Nelson, a fifth-year senior, 
will be counted 
on to lead the Gators’ inexpe-rienced receiv-ing corps next season, and his 
time off has al-
lowed him to be more of a coach 
for the other wideouts.
“I can take a step back and 
see everything going on at once,” Nelson said. “I’m trying 
to be more of a vocal leader and 
give everyone my thoughts on the plays and routes. I’ve been around the block, and I’ve seen 
everything and know everything 
about the offense.”
Nelson said the different per-
spective has helped him develop as well, as he’s able to observe 
the offense’s plays and defense’s 
reactions more closely.BROWN DRAWS PRAISE AT COR -
NER: Last spring, cornerback 
Jeremy Brown looked poised for 
playing time as a freshman be-fore a back injury held him out of 
the 2008 season. This year, he has 
picked up where he left off.
“Oh, man. I’m just telling you, 
don’t sleep on him,” Meyer said. 
“He was ahead of Janoris Jen-
kins before he got hurt (last fall). Just think about that for a min-ute.”
To see regular playing time, 
Brown will either have to sup-plant starters Jenkins and Joe Haden or beat out Wondy Pierre-Louis and Adrian Bushell for the 
third corner spot when Jenkins 
plays at nickelback.
Wilks likely out for season after suffering torn ACL

FOOTBALL SEASON TICKETS POLL QUESTION SCOREBOARDHarrison Diamond / Alligator Staff 
UF outfielder Jonathan Pigott checks a bunt attempt during the Gators’ 10-2 win against Tennessee on 
March 21 at McKethan Stadium. Pigott and his brother, Daniel, combined for five RBIs on Wednesday.
By KYLE MAISTRI

Two Pigotts were better than 
one for the Gators on Wednesday 
night. 
Freshman Daniel Pigott (20 
starts this season) has seen the bulk of the two brothers’ playing time, but junior Jonathan Pigott 
(six starts) got in on the action as 
UF defeated Stetson 15-4 in McK-ethan Stadium. 
“I like playing with my broth-
er, and it was good for both of us 
to play well,” Jonathan said. 
Jonathan went 3 for 6 with 
two RBIs and a run, includ-
ing a triple to center field in the 
sixth inning. He got the start in 
place of Avery Barnes, who was given the day off after colliding with FSU pitcher Tyler Everett in Tuesday’s win. Jonathan took 
advantage of his opportunity in 
the field as well, making the play of the game defensively when he took a double away from Stetson 
left fielder Frank Florio.
The Hatters had just tied the 
game at 3-3 in the fourth inning and were in position to take the 
lead when Florio ripped a Justin Poovey offering down the left-field line. Jonathan tracked the 
ball down on a full sprint and laid 
out to make a full-extension div-ing catch, preventing the Gators from falling behind.
“It certainly puts us in a much 
more difficult situation (if Jona-
than doesn’t make the catch), because both runners 
score there and 
they take the lead and who knows?” UF coach Kevin 
O’Sullivan said. “The momen-tum shifts now, and now we’re playing from behind, and who knows? It certainly kept the mo-mentum on our end.”
UF (25-12) parlayed that mo-
mentum into a combined 11 runs in the fifth and sixth innings, bat-ting around both times, to break 
the game wide open. 
Daniel, who was 4 for 6 with 3 
runs and three RBIs, took a hang-
ing curveball from Stetson’s Nick Pigott brothers come up big in UF victory vs. Stetson
Let’s be honest. The UF baseball 
team isn’t a national contend-er, and Kevin O’Sullivan hasn’t 
turned it into a powerhouse over-
night. He’s not a miracle worker.
And there’s absolutely nothing 
wrong with that. That’s because 
O’Sullivan has done exactly what has been expected of him. When he 
was hired a little more than two years 
ago, he was one of the brightest pitch-
ing minds in college baseball. Now Gainesville is seeing why.
The Gators’ second-year coach 
has taken a group of seven freshman 
pitchers and showed how quickly he 
can develop talent.
On Tuesday night, O’Sullivan 
put the ball in the hands of fresh-man righty Greg Larson, and he re-sponded with 4 1/3 innings of score-less baseball. UF has three freshmen — Nick Maronde, Alex Panteliodis and Anthony DeSclafani — who are regular contrib-utors, and the highest ERA of any of them is 
4.19 (Maronde). 
Panteliodis and 
DeSclafani are sub-4.00 and have eaten up 
significant in-
nings. Larson has a ridiculous 0.89 
ERA in 16 appearances as one of the Gators’ most reliable relievers. Fresh-man pitchers can’t do this unless they 
have a coach who shows them how 
to. 
Yes, Maronde was one of the 
highest-rated prep pitchers out there. 
That’s why he and DeSclafani were taken in the MLB Draft and could be playing minor-league ball right now. Still, they’re finding ways to get qual-O’Sullivan right man for job

With all his team has accomplished in 
the last two seasons, it’s hard to imagine 
UF coach Tim Walton could do something 
that hasn’t been done in that span. 
But he did just that Wednesday night: 
He was thrown out of the game.
In the sixth inning, Walton disputed a 
call with third-base umpire Diane Kend-
all after pinch runner Le-Net Franklin ran into Central Florida shortstop Tiffany Lane while heading to third and was called out.
Clearly frustrated with the ruling and 
hoping for an interference call on Lane, Walton threw his hat on the ground, and Kendall threw Walton off the field, draw-ing cheers and applause from the crowd.
“I was going to get thrown out, there’s 
no question about it,” Walton said.
“That’s why I argued it. You just get to 
the point where you’ve got to defend your players. I wanted to make my point and let my players know that I had their backs.”
Whether he intended it or not, Walton’s 
ejection fired his team up. In the next at-bat, right fielder Alicia Sisco stepped up to the 
plate and singled, driving in pinch runner 
Lauren Heil. 
That was all the No. 1 Gators (43-3) 
needed, as they beat the Knights (21-23) 3-0 
at Katie Seashole Pressly Stadium.
Sisco said the crowd’s reaction to her 
coach’s exit pumped her up, and that 
helped her add to the Gators’ 2-run lead at the time.
“Alicia Sisco responded for me, and 
that’s what you hope for,” Walton said. “Whether it’s a tight game or a blowout, as the head coach, you’ve got to defend your 
players. 
“I don’t allow my players to talk back 
to umpires, so I’ve got to go to battle for 
them.”
Stephanie Brombacher (18-0, 0.91 ERA) 
got the win for UF, striking out 10 batters while giving up just three hits.UF SOFTBALLWalton tossed in Gators’ winSEE BASE, p AGE 27

ity hitters out in college baseball, and they may be doing 
it in bigger venues than some minor-league parks. They’ve improved, and that doesn’t happen without coaches know-ing how to play the right mental cards with their players, 
especially in baseball.
“I tend to be a little bit harder on (freshmen),” O’Sullivan 
said. “I want them to understand the value of an out. The 
value of hitting spots. Making good pitches early in the 
count. Making good pitches late in the count. Getting the 
leadoff hitter. You tend to coach those guys a lot more. I’ve 
always been that way. Once they figure it out, you leave them alone.”
The highest ERA (9.00) on the team belongs to Chas 
Spottswood, and he has only thrown five innings all year. Other than that, there’s a sprinkling of sub-3.00 and sub-4.00 ERAs across the roster.
The Gators’ 25-12 record shows this team has potential to 
win a regional for the first time in four years.
Even if UF does make it that far, it doesn’t matter as much 
as what’s going on in the living rooms of high school players across America when O’Sullivan walks in. If he continues to sign and develop pitchers the way he is now, a consistent baseball program has arrived in Gainesville.
And inconsistency was exactly why Pat McMahon was 
fired. That’s why you 86 a coach just two years after making the College World Series: You know he can’t do it year in and year out.
If O’Sullivan can keep getting this caliber of pitching, he 
won’t struggle to do that.
That’s why O’Sullivan has proven he’s the right man for 
the job. 
And that’s why the rest of the Southeastern Conference’s 
hitters should not look forward to playing at McKethan Sta-
dium for a long, long time.BRIAN , from page 25

inning offensive explosion.
The Gators are now averaging over 12 runs per 
game in their last eight contests. 
“As long as we get contributions from everybody 
from top to bottom, your offense never goes in the tank,” O’Sullivan said.   
For the second straight game, UF used a 3-run 
home run to jump on its opponent in the first inning. Preston Tucker took Stetson starter Jake Hitchcock deep to right for his fourth consecutive home run in a game at home — he hit three in a row in the late 
innings against Central Florida on April 8.
Senior Patrick Keating (2-3, 6.39 ERA) got the 
start for the Gators and struggled yet again on the mound. He gave up nine hits over his 3 1/3 innings 
of work and was pulled in favor of Poovey during 
the Hatters’ rally in the fourth inning.
O’Sullivan said he plans to stick with Keating in 
the midweek games. 
“He’s going to keep going out 
there and keep starting games,” O’Sullivan said. “I say it every 
week and I’ll say it until the sea-son’s over, I think he’s going to fig-
ure it out.”
The teams recorded a combined 
31 hits and used 12 pitchers over 
the 8 1/2 innings of play. Freshman Alex Pan-teliodis (3-4, 3.76 ERA) was especially effective for UF in his 1 2/3 scoreless innings, allowing just one 
hit and picking up the win.Keating’s struggles continue against Hatters
Brombacher said she and se-
nior pitcher Stacey Nelson are 
capable of winning games when 
the Gators’ bats aren’t hot.
“As long as we can go out 
there and put a few runs up on 
the board, me and Stacey are go-
ing to hold them,” Brombacher 
said. “Three runs is plenty for us.”
The undefeated sophomore 
pitcher said the game provided 
a chance to see what the team 
might look like next season when Gardiner, Nelson and the rest of the seniors will no longer be with 
the team.
There were no seniors behind 
Brombacher in the 
field Wednesday 
night. 
The only senior 
who saw time on 
defense or at the plate was Ali Gar-
diner, who moved from her usual position at first base to designat-ed hitter. 
“Getting playing experience 
in different positions and seeing what we will look like next year is good for us and for everyone to see that next year we’re still 
going to be around,” Brombacher 
said. 
With the victory, the Gators 
have now defeated all six in-state 
opponents they have faced. UF 
beat FSU, Florida International, South Florida, Florida Atlantic and Jacksonville earlier this sea-son.
“We’ve got to beat the teams 
in-state because they’re the re-gional teams,” Walton said, adding that defeating teams in 
Florida also helps his recruiting 
efforts.Lineup without seniors gives glimpse of next yearBASE , from page 25

■ THE POSITION HAS BE-
COME A STRENGTH FOR UF.
By PHIL KEGLER

Eight months ago, safeties coach 
Chuck Heater sat in his chair on a 
raised platform at UF’s preseason Media Day and tried to explain why the 2008 season would be different, 
how a secondary that gave up 373 
passing yards to Michigan in the 2008 Capital One Bowl could pos-sibly be any better after entering fall two-a-days with three scholarship players at safety.
The trio consisted of one return-
ing starter (Major Wright), one con-verted cornerback (Ahmad Black) 
and an incoming freshman who just 
arrived on campus (Will Hill).
“I don’t listen to the radio shows. 
I don’t read the newspapers,” Heat-er said at Media Day regarding his critics. “I work for (coach) Urban Meyer.”
Meyer should have little criticism for Heater this spring.
Rarely does a position go from 
being a weakness to earning praise on SportsCenter, but that is exactly what happened with the UF safeties. And during a spring where it seems starters get injured each day, the safeties have remained completely intact. 
Wright and Black return as start-
ers after anchoring a Gators second-
ary that intercepted 26 passes, tops 
in the Southeastern Conference.  Hill will look to find even more play-ing time after stellar performances in spot situations in 2008, when he mostly saw action in the team’s nickel defense as well as on special teams. Rising redshirt senior Dorian Munroe is back after watching last 
season from the sidelines due to a 
summer ACL tear, and Scout.com four-star recruit Dee Finley is final-ly in Gainesville, albeit a year later than expected.
“Well, it’s the first time we’ve 
had depth,” Heater said. “Of course, I had a bunch of safeties going into last spring, and two months later 
they were all gone.”Attrition depleted Heater’s stock 
of safeties when Jamar Hornsby was kicked off the team for his le-
gal issues, Jerimy Finch decided to transfer to Indiana, and penciled-in starter Munroe went down with his injury prior to two-a-days.
Black turned out to be the sur-
prise of the season and started all 14 games at safety. Over the course of the season, the 5-foot-9, 185-pounder 
intercepted seven 
passes, including his highlight-reel ripaway from Juaquin Iglesias with less than 10 minutes left in the National Cham-pionship Game. 
This, of course, 
was after Black tipped a pass and 
Wright intercepted it near the goal line right before halftime, which also followed Wright laying out Manuel Johnson during an attempted catch in the first quarter.
“The way I look at it, we’ve got 
four starters at safety,” Meyer said. 
“Dorian was a starter. Will Hill basi-cally is a starter, and then you’ve got 
the two guys who did start.”
It will be interesting to see how 
the battle for the season opener’s two starting spots on Sept. 5 pans out. The rotation will be there, but so far this spring, Heater hasn’t tipped his hand too much, giving all five guys some reps with the first-squad defense. While Wright and Black, an All-SEC second teamer, stood out 
last year, Munroe is back and gun-
ning for a starting job. 
Hill has been working out exclu-
sively at safety this spring after Jano-ris Jenkins shifted to the third corner in the nickel defense, and Finley is quickly learning the ropes due to his high “football quotient,” according to Heater. Meyer said Finley may be 
the first player he’s recruited who 
went through a prep academy.
“They realize that type of situa-
tion should make them a better foot-ball player,” Heater said of the close competition. “It doesn’t allow them to relax for a moment, both mentally or physically.” 
So far, the returns are quite 
promising. In a goal-line scrim-mage earlier this spring, the first two possessions ended in intercep-
tions by safeties: Black picked off 
Tim Tebow, and Hill grabbed a John Brantley pass. 
Black said there is a noticeable 
swagger this season stretching from the safeties to the corners to the line, which is to be expected with UF re-turning its top 22 defensive players from last season.
But no matter the talent level, no 
more than two or three safeties will be playing at the same time in fall. 
“Ultimately, someday, someone 
is going to be on the field and some-one is going to be watching, and you gotta really manage that,” Heater acknowledged. “My conversation with them is, ‘Earn the right to play. 
Be a good enough football player for 
us to win a championship. It’s my job then to make sure you get on the football field.’”
No matter what the rotation, 
someone will likely take fault with Heater’s choice.
Good thing he doesn’t read the 
papers, then. They’ve been wrong 
before.
Healthy, deep safety unit ready for 2009 season
