If you’re wondering what the 
going rate for a man-sized chilli 
pepper is, Daniel Helfrich will 
tell you it costs four Powerade bottles and a smile. 
But his joy of owning such a 
massive fake fruit burned in the 
end because it only took per-
petrators two days to steal his 
prized pepper. 
On July 16, Helfrich and his 
girlfriend, Ellen Toneff, were out for lunch at the Chili’s on Archer Road when they saw the plump pepper perched on the parking lot. 
“Chili’s was doing some reno-
vations and the giant chili was sitting outside,” Helfrich said, a 19-year-old UF classics junior. They joked about the idea 
of taking it home — but talking 
about it just wasn’t enough. 
The manager told them to 
speak with the renovation crew and that’s when they started bar-
tering. 
Helfrich offered some ice 
cream, but instead, the parched workers wanted something to 
drink.  So Helfrich brought them 
two blue and two yellow bottles of Powerade. 
He then called his friend “Cool 
Kyle” to help hoist the 200-pound UF student feels the burn after man-sized chili gets stolen

For the homeless in Gainesville, ﬁ  nd-
ing food is a daily struggle.
But the city, once labeled ﬁ  fth meanest 
to the homeless by the National Coalition 
for the Homeless, goes through immense 
efforts to feed its homeless population, 
despite the ranking.
Institutions like St. Francis House Inc., 
Porters Community Farm and GRACE Marketplace are offering their services to feed the homeless and help get them back on their feet.
Candice Jones, a volunteer coordina-
tor with St. Francis House, which helps 
feed and house some of the homeless 
here in Gainesville, said she’s surprised by the ranking.
While Jones has been asked to not re-
veal donor’s names, she said churches, businesses, organizations and sororities 
are among the numerous supporters that 
contribute food donations to St. Francis House.
“If someone has a catering event at 
their job, and they have a lot of leftover food, we get that,” she said.
St. Francis House opens its doors be-
tween 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. and feeds an average of 235 individuals a day.
“My overall experience has been a 
hopeful and grateful one,” said Jeremy Kemp, a 28-year-old Iraq War veteran 
currently living at St. Francis House.Homeless

Since Gator Net, a ﬁ  ber-optic Internet ser-
vice, offered an upgrade from 50 megabits 
per second to 100 Mbps, seven out of 37 of its Gainesville clients began negotiating an upgrade.  
“We’ve deﬁ  nitely seen an increase in in-
terest,” Frank Latini said, a Gainesville Re-gional Utilities manager.   
Latini said although he could conﬁ  rm 
that seven apartment complexes are in the process of upgrading, he cannot comment on which ones until negotiations are ﬁ  nal-ized, which takes time to do. 
“Sometimes it’s fairly quick,” he said. Residents at The Courtyard Apartments 
use Gator Net at 50 Mbps as part of its utili-ties, but resident Hunter Krug, a 21-year-old UF food and resource economics senior, doesn’t think upgrading is necessary.    
“I don’t think I would pay for 100 Mbps 
because I think 50 Mbps is OK,” Krug said. Krug and his three roommates can eas-
ily stream Netﬂ  ix, watch television and play Xbox at the same time without hav-ing to worry about slow Internet.
At Cypress Glen Apartments, residents 
can choose whether to pay for Gator Net. 
They are given a month-long free trial 
to decide if they want to pay a $25 month-ly fee for the service.
“Most of the residents buy Gator Net 
after they have it for a month,” Aston Steele said, a leasing agent at Cypress Glen. “There’s deﬁ  nitely a major differ-ence in Internet speed.”Interest grows for upgraded Gator Net service

He said typical lunches and 
dinners at St. Francis House 
consist of chicken and other meats and vegetables. Meals change depending on who do-
nates on a given day.
“We’re very appreciative of 
the ones who donate,” he said. 
“It’s for a great cause.”
St. Francis House provides 
the homeless with fresh pro-duce through donations from Porters Community Farm, an organic urban farm located a 
few blocks away.
Chris Cano, a founder of 
Gainesville Compost, which 
works with Porters, said the farm works to help low-income residents in the area, as well as the homeless.
He said the farm offers a 
“U-Pick-U-Pay What You Can 
Farm Stand” as one of its ser-
vices, and community resident plant beds are available for resi-dents in the area to use.
GRACE Marketplace, which 
stands for Gainesville Regional Alachua County Empower-ment, is another institution that works to provide food and 
shelter for the homeless.
Theresa Lowe, the executive director of the Alachua County 
Coalition for the Homeless and Hungry, said GRACE Market-place was created to not only feed the homeless, but also to provide a convenient one-stop location for individuals to re-ceive help getting back toward 
self-sufﬁ  ciency.
She said Bread of the Mighty 
food bank helps GRACE sup-
ply breakfast, which consists of coffee, yogurt, fruit and other typical breakfast items. Church groups donate food for its din-ners, and GRACE gets pizza from Domino’s Pizza as a treat 
for residents occasionally.
Holy Trinity Episcopal 
Church is one of the churches 
that donates food to GRACE Marketplace.
Harvey Ward, the execu-
tive director of the Holy Trinity Episcopal Foundation and cur-rent candidate for county com-
missioner, said church mem-
bers prepare 75 bag lunches that are delivered to GRACE every Thursday.
He said young children at 
the church help decorate the bags.
“The kids really enjoy it, and 
it connects them with the whole 
point of the gospel, which is 
helping those who are less for-tunate,” Ward said.pepper into the back of his pick-
up truck. 
“We hauled it off in the rain,” 
Toneff said, a 21-year-old UF bi-
ology senior. 
A chili of such size couldn’t 
possibly ﬁ  t through the front door of his Pavilion on 62nd apartment, so Helfrich and his crew decided to hoist it to his bal-
cony with ropes. 
“We had to have two ropes,” 
Toneff said. “The railing was 
about to break.” 
Unable to get it to his balcony, 
Helfrich left the pepper on his neighbor’s ﬁ  rst-ﬂ  oor balcony, tied up, to discourage anyone from taking it. 
That night, the culprits struck. The ropes holding it were cut, 
and the chili was gone before Helfrich even woke up. 
He went to work, business as 
usual, and was unaware that the chili was even missing. A friend told him later that the balcony where they placed it was empty. 
“It survived one night,” Hel-
frich said. 
He ﬁ  led a police report to ﬁ  nd his priceless pepper on Tuesday. 
The apartment complex has 
a gated entrance where a guard takes information from new visi-
tors.  
“Someone snuck it past the 
security guard,” Toneff said. She 
doesn’t know how a giant chili could slip by the guarded gate. 
Helfrich took to Facebook’s 
“UF Class of 2016” thread to post that he was missing the chili and that a reward was in store for a 
successful return — ﬁ  ttingly with 
a Chili’s gift card valued at $20. “I had the chili for two days,” 
Helfrich said. “But that is the most likes on Facebook I’ve ever had.” 
Helfrich had big plans for 
the chili, like spicing it up with Christmas lights to have as deco-ration on his balcony. Helfrich and his friends usually “do it 
big” for the holidays, so having 
the pepper would have meant a lot to them.  
“He’s really sad and wants his 
chili back,” Toneff said about her boyfriend.

When Satchel’s Pizza placed sixth in 
Kristin Chirico’s BuzzFeed article, “18 
Pizza Joints You Must Try Before You 
Die,” it wasn’t a surprise to Gainesville 
residents.
Satchel’s, which has been tossing out 
slices of its now BuzzFeed-famous piz-
za for 11 years, has been considered a 
“Gainesville institution” since its doors  first opened. 
Satchel Raye, founder of Satchel’s Piz-
za, said he first heard about the BuzzFeed 
article through a casual text message con-
versation with a manager.
The pizza aficionado said Satchel’s 
stands out from the crowd because of its 
visually stimulating atmosphere. 
The restaurant is decorated with quirky 
pieces of art and a vintage Volkswagen 
van that seats customers.
“I feel like all the other stuff is what 
makes us different,” he said. “The pizza is what people love.”Jordan Borstelmann, a bartender at 
Satchel’s, said the best pizza he’s ever had has been at the restaurant.
He said the style and the attitude of the 
employees creates a great environment 
for customers to enjoy.
“People really feel comfortable,” he 
said. “They feel like they’re at home when 
they come here.”
Niko Cousins, a 20-year-old business 
management junior at St. Leo University, 
brought his girlfriend, 18-year-old St. Leo 
University marketing freshman Alyssa Mercadante, to Satchel’s for her first time on Wednesday.
“It’s something that people don’t re-
ally find everywhere, and I think that’s what people are looking for, something different,” Mercadante said.THURSDAY, JULY 24, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 5

New alumna Janice Goodson

She wants to take ﬂ  ight lessons 
and prepare for her daughter’s 
wedding.
But someday, she wants to be 
an adjunct professor for Santa Fe College’s newly accredited Bache-lor of Science in Nursing Comple-tion Program.
Goodson is one of the 19 mem-
bers of the program’s ﬁ  rst gradu-ating class.
SFC decided to initiate a four-
year bachelor’s program in nurs-ing to increase access to higher education for entry-level, associ-ate degree-prepared nurses.
This ﬂ  exible, mostly online program is designed for working nurses, said Lois Ellis, director of Nursing Programs at SFC.
“My new degree has increased 
my ability to apply for different positions,” said Goodson, who currently works at UF Health Shands Hospital.
Seven of the graduates in the 
inaugural class were more than 50 years old, according to a press release.
Expert nurses come in to help 
on clinical days, which Goodson said gave greater exposure to the different realms of nursing.
Ellis said that working nurses 
are also encouraged to design re-
quired class projects around situa-
tions they encounter in their jobs.
Goodson said the program is 
constantly improving.
“Professors took our feedback 
and made meaningful changes as we were working,” she said. “You were valued as the professional.”Santa Fe College’s bachelor’s nursing program now accredited

Vote or post a message at www.alligator.orgTuesday’s question: Will you go to this 
year’s Gator Growl? Today’s question: Have you heard about the giant chili 
theft?Step out of the way, government haters
As late July turns to August, a few events are certain: 
Fall semester starts in just four short weeks, Gator football kicks off and the home stretch 2014 election 
begins. With the election looming, along with the glut of neg-ative advertising, constant phone calls, campaign emails and 
fundraising requests, it’s time we broach a serious topic. 
If you don’t like the concept of government or the idea of 
governing, it’s time for you to step out of the way for those 
who actually care about the future of American society. 
Most of us agree that government is not the solution to 
our community, state or national ills. But government serves an important purpose, and we are beginning to lose sight of what it is government can accomplish. 
The government operates as the facilitator for the rest 
of society to function. Without the government, our roads would — and in many cases are starting to — crumble, the public school system would disappear and many of the basic services we need to survive would simply evaporate. 
It may not seem like it’s happening, but the evaporation 
has already started. If those who do not understand, like or want to govern get out of the way for those who do, the U.S.’ lost decade could turn into a lost century. 
According to the American Society of Civil Engineers, 
the current state of the country’s infrastructure earned the not-so-stellar grade of a D plus in 2013. Our roads, airports, bridges, power grid and drinking water are just a few of the many major infrastructure crises that need addressing. 
In fact, the only area that received a grade better than a C 
was how the country handles its solid waste. It received a B minus. 
How could we start making progress and improve the 
nation’s decaying infrastructure?  
Electing leaders who want to act and understand the role 
government plays in helping American society grow and ﬂ  ourish. For an easy local issue, let’s look at our roads and how government inaction can ultimately hurt growth. 
Alachua County has a $550 million backlog of road proj-
ects. If you’re a private company from another state and are looking to move jobs to Alachua County, a deciding factor could be the crumbling roads. If your employees have a difﬁ  -
cult time getting to and from work, why would you want to move those jobs to Alachua County?
Hopefully, that small example 
helps underscore the symbiotic relationship government plays with private enterprise. One can-not exist without the other and if businesses are willing to invest in 
themselves to grow and prosper, then government has the same responsibility to the people it serves. 
Here’s another strange concept: If you hate government, 
don’t run for public ofﬁ  ce. The logic of running for ofﬁ  ce and 
hating government is about as asinine as despising the pe-
troleum industry but spending your life working for an oil company. 
Government doesn’t have to be big or intrusive, but it 
needs to be functional. We need government at the local, state and national levels to operate efﬁ  ciently.
With a major election on the horizon, we need leaders 
who want to make the government work for the people and who commit to ensuring that the government is ready to 
handle the challenges we face. 
Someone pledging to drown government in a bathtub, 
remove all regulations — no matter what — or refuse to 
spend a penny on our crumbling infrastructure is not who we need. 
Remember, elections are job interviews for leaders, and 
it’s our responsibility to hire the best people for the job. Let’s be honest,  you would never interview for a job by telling the employer that you hate the company and everything it 
does, right?
That’s essentially what a sizable chunk of candidates are 
saying to get elected.
Stop hiring the saboteurs and hire leaders who will spend 
your tax dollars wisely and allow the government to func-
tion.

Darts & Laurels
It was a rough week for same-sex couples wishing to get 
married in Florida. Just when a victory in Monroe County 
seemed like a possibility, Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi 
denied one Key West gay couple’s plea for a marriage license while higher courts debate the constitutionality of Florida’s 
same-sex marriage ban. We’re giving a keep-ﬁ  ghting-the-
good-ﬁ  ght LAUREL to Florida couples ﬁ  ling lawsuits and 
demanding marriage equality in Florida. 
Meanwhile, as all these lovely couples are waiting for, 
y’know, basic rights, straight people are busy doin’ it in 
broad daylight on the beach. We’re tossing a you-couldn’t-
think-of-a-better-place-to-do-the-nasty DART to the Florida 
couple having sex on Bradenton Beach, who were caught on video by a passerby. At this point, we’re convinced Gawker 
would fold if so many whackos in Florida stopped doing 
gross things. 
We were excited to report earlier this week that the Gator 
Growl lineup was announced, and it both included a come-dian and excluded pandering-to-alumni musicians. Ludacris and Foster the People will appear for Gator Growl 2014, and 
new-SNL-alumnus Brooks Wheelan will emcee. So this week, 
a step-in-the-right-direction LAUREL is going to the Gator 
Growl committee.
The Tampa Bay Business Journal reported that Google 
helped Florida’s economy by assisting in the generation of $6.5 billion of economic activity. Visit Florida, the state’s cen-
tral tourism campaign, increased its media budget to include 
funding for Google AdWords and AdSense, and Google gave $2.7 million in free advertising last year through AdGrants. 
On one hand, tourism is Florida’s biggest moneymaker, but 
on the other hand — ugh, tourists. We’re handing off a mon-
ey-yes-shoobies-no FLART at Google.  
We close with our ﬁ  nal DART: Gainesville Mayor Ed 
Braddy. When you hold public ofﬁ  ce and are responsible for the livelihood of an entire city — especially one that houses 
a large university — you’re expected to maintain a certain 
level of decorum. This week, the mayor ﬁ  led and subsequent-ly rescinded a complaint about a stalker, an “ex-paramour,” 
according to the Gainesville Sun, who ﬂ  ooded Braddy and 
Braddy’s girlfriend with incessant texts and Facebook mes-sages after Braddy ended the affair in June. The Sun wrote: 
“During that relationship, the woman would send Braddy 
‘provocative’ or ‘racy’ messages and, if he had a ‘sexually charged response,’ she would forward it to his girlfriend, the 
police report stated.”
Some debate surrounds the Sun’s decision to run the story 
on the complaint and its details. However, we feel residents and voters have a right to know if an elected ofﬁ  cial is vio-
lating the city’s code of ethical standards, which states, “...successful operation of a democratic government requires

Brains and brawn might 
go hand in hand according to 
a study that links gym mem-bership to higher GPAs.
The study by Michigan 
State University provides support for the idea that the membership provided to UF students through activity and service fees in their tu-ition could be directly linked to academic success.
According to the study, 
which compared recreation-
al sports facility members to 
nonmembers, members had signiﬁ  cantly higher cumula-tive college GPA and cumu-lative credits completed after four consecutive semesters.
“In general, we are conﬁ  -
dent that students or people getting active, moving and 
exercising has an impact on 
their ability to learn,” said David Bowles, director of the department of recreational sports at UF. 
“It’s not surprising that 
the students who are in the gym, who are exercising and who are moving are then the ones who are more success-ful in their classes and get-ting better grades.”
The study supports the 
idea that providing students with easily available access to ﬁ  tness will further academic success and have continued brain health beneﬁ  ts.
“It can improve oxygen 
ﬂ  ow and brain neurotrans-mitter ﬁ  ring,” said Natalie Rella, health promotion spe-cialist at GatorWell. “De-pending on the kind of phys-
ical activity you’re doing, 
you can actually grow your brain. It’s kind of amazing.”
Exercise can also help stu-
dents be more successful by providing them with social beneﬁ  ts as well, Rella said.
“The social impact of 
physical activity, especially 
in a recreational sports set-
ting, can also improve aca-demic performance,” she said. “It’s getting that sup-port system that can get you through those tough times.”
Jayla Bostic, a member 
of the UF Women’s Track & Field team who exercises six 
days a week, said she was 
not surprised by the ﬁ  ndings of the survey.
“I think it makes sense, 
because I know when I work out that’s kind of a stress re-liever, and when it is time for me to do my homework and study, I don’t feel like I have 
too much pent up,” said the 
21-year-old health science senior with a 3.53 GPA.
Bowles said the ﬁ  ndings 
of the study align with the RecSports vision of promot-ing a world in motion one Gator at a time.
“We want them to be the 
role models for their families and the people they work with and spreading that good word to wherever they go in the world,” Bowles said. 
“The more people that are 
active, the better off we are going to be.”Study shows gym 
membership could mean higher GPA

The Florida Legislature re-
cently ruled that two of Florida’s 
redrawn districts are illegal.
Judge Terry Lewis ruled that 
the districts, which are redrawn 
every 10 years, violate a gerry-
mandering law that prohibits one political party from gaining an advantage in an election over another party.
The illegal districts are Rep. 
Corrine Brown’s district, a Dem-ocrat whose district stretches from Jacksonville to Orlando and 
Rep. Daniel Webster’s district, a 
Republican whose district is in Central Florida. 
There are 27 districts in Flor-
ida.
Keith Lee, a UF political sci-ence Ph.D. candidate, said the 
reason districts are redrawn is to 
make them more competitive.
But if voters oppose a political 
candidate’s party in their district, it could discourage them from voting because they feel their vote doesn’t matter, he said.
For political candidates, the re-
drawn districts mean two things.
For incumbents, if the district 
lines are redrawn, it might not include the candidate’s house, which means they would have to rule in a district that they aren’t familiar with.
For non-incumbents, the re-
drawn districts could discourage challengers because they aren’t 
sure who they are going to run 
against.
“Whoever wins the election,” 
he said, “is going to be very vocal when it comes to redrawing the map.”Brown, a UF alumna, said in 
a statement on July 15 that Judge Lewis’ ruling is seriously ﬂ  awed.
The ruling violates the 1965 
Voting Rights Act because it denies African-Americans the opportunity to elect a represen-tative who shares their “ethnic identity,” she said.
“Minority communities do not 
live in compact, cookie-cutter like neighborhoods,” Brown said.
If the legislature places more 
of an emphasis on district com-pactness at the cost of preserving minority access, she said, the dis-tricts would fragment minority communities across the state.
Webster did not respond to re-
quests for comment.
The Florida Legislature will 
not redraw new legislative dis-tricts until after the 2014 elec-tion, and it wasn’t speciﬁ  ed who would redraw the maps. Florida voting districts ruled illegal theAvenue

Already known for dropping 
beats, No Southern Accent hopes to 
soon be dropping something else: 
its second studio album.   
The UF a capella group an-
nounced its planned second album Friday, and that it needs help from fans to make the album a reality.
The fundraising efforts just start-
ed last week, said Fallon McKain, 22, a mechanical engineering senior major and NSA president. 
Going forward, the group plans 
to fundraise and promote the album 
by singing to tailgaters on game 
days in the Fall and during the two concerts a year it hosts at the end of each semester.
The goal is $12,000 to mix, mas-
ter and produce the album, McKain said. That total also takes into con-sideration getting the rights to use other artists’ songs. Donations can 
be made at nsaccent.com/cddona-
tion/
Songs on the album include “Time” by Hans Zimmer, “Ra-
dioactive” by Imagine Dragons, 
“Separate Ways” by Journey and “Holy Grail” by Jay Z featuring Jus-tin Timberlake to name a few, said Amanda Garrett, 20, a sophomore marketing major and NSA public relations director.
She said NSA has been using 
social media to promote the new al-
bum and sending letters out to fam-
ily members and alumni.
It will also contain the sets per-
formed at the International Cham-pionship of Collegiate A Capella South Quarterfinals in 2014, where the group placed first for the first time in UF history and was recog-nized for outstanding vocal percus-
sion.
“We hope that our second al-
bum can grow to new heights, get 
our name out in the a capella com-munity and make UF proud,” Gar-rett said.
NSA is working with Plaid 
Productions, who co-engineered six tracks for Fox’s “Glee” and has 
worked with several other a capella 
groups. A tentative release date is scheduled for the Fall, Garrett said.
When it’s ready, it will be avail-
able on iTunes, Spotify, Pandora and in hard copy, McKain said.
“I think the group has grown 
a lot since the first album and we have delved into different genres,” she said. “We are still doing the top 40s that traditional a capella groups do but we have progressed compet-
itively and are a bigger name in the 
a capella world.”
NSA released its debut album in 
2011 and was nominated for four Contemporary A Capella Record-ing Awards. It also had one song put on “Voices Only,” an album that encompasses the best of colle-giate a capella all over the country.
This new effort differs from the 
debut album, “Group Therapy,” because there are new singers, new-er songs, new arrangements and an overall new sound.
“We took more of a contempo-
rary approach with more recogniz-able songs,” said Alex Greene, 23, a fifth-year materials science engi-
neering student and the NSA music 
director from Fall 2012 to Spring 2014, who is tracking, arranging and producing the album. Tracking involves recording individual sing-ers performing the tracks before 
they are later mixed together.
“It shows the evolution of the 
group over the last few years and 
shows that the group has gotten progressively better.”

The indie pop band known as Fun. set the 
charts ablaze with its hit singles “We Are Young” 
and “Some Nights.” 
While the group relentlessly toured the past 
few years, its guitarist, Marc Antonoff, slaved 
away at a secret project. This project, a band 
called Bleachers, ofﬁ  cially debuted this year with 
the release of the hit single “I Wanna Get Bet-
ter.”  
The debut album, “Strange Desire,” straight 
off RCA Records, cements Antonoff as an excep-
tional solo musician who’s adept at experiment-
ing with multiple genres.
After jamming to “I Wanna Get Better” on 
a daily basis, I pondered how Antonoff would 
compose the rest of the album. Would it follow 
its lead single’s sweeping energy and anthemic 
hooks? “Strange Desire” ends up ﬂ  irting with 
several alternative subgenres. Call Bleachers an indie pop band all you like, but this debut LP proves it amounts to so much more.
Such diversity may weigh down other albums, 
but Antonoff deftly juggles multiple sounds over the course of “Strange Desire.” “Wild Heart” be-gins as a traditional alternative tune but gradu-ally morphs into a fuzzily distorted symphony. 
“Wake Me” dials the energy back in favor of 
beachy guitar chords and such rumination like 
“I’d rather be sad with you / than with any other girls but you.” “Shadow” ﬁ  nds Antonoff channeling his punk 
inspirations as he playfully plucks away at his guitar — something he learned to do quite well with Fun. — among bouncy synths and booming drums.
While Bleachers is technically comprised sole-
ly by Antonoff, producer John Hill plays a critical 
role shaping the album’s multifaceted personal-
ity. Hill takes traditional rock instrumentals and layers them with a bevy of sound effects. Every-thing from car crashes to echoing vocal snippets 
accompany Antonoff’s slick voice and punchy 
instrumentals.
Antonoff alternates between a forlorn bass 
and hopeful baritone as he painstakingly deliv-
ers the nuanced lyricism of the album. “Strange Desire” contains songs of eager love but also holds regretful mourning. This duality deﬁ  nes the album and also mirrors the two features: Grimes croons as a lover on “Take Me Away,” while Yoko Ono looks ahead as a griever on “I’m Ready To Move.”
Antonoff’s lyrics, inspired by his sister’s 
death, propel “Strange Desire” to even greater heights. “Who I Want You To Love” ends with glitchy vocals from presumably his late sister, telling the listener “I want to be grateful for the experiences I’ve had.” 
Bleachers reminds us of how life’s struggles 
can break us down, but we possess the strength to carry onward and reﬂ  ect on everything that has shaped us to become who we are now, even if it hurts.Fun. guitarist’s project puts out ﬁ  rst LP , exceeds expectationsmusic

Bruce Yang and his friends woke up the morning 
after his bachelor party and checked their phones to 
make sure they hadn’t posted anything embarrassing on social media. That’s when Yang decided to create the app, Sobrr.
The app encourages users to “live in the moment” 
by posting photos, videos and making “friendships” that all get deleted within 24 hours, said Ryan Koehn, the app’s marketing and communications generator. Users can keep the friendships if both parties agree.
Now, Sobrr is being used by young social net-
workers across the U.S. and even internationally, Koehn said. The developers now want to focus on the college market.
He said the app is intended for “socially active” 
people aged 17 to 35 and those who are tired of the current state of social media. The actual demographic includes 40-year-olds because of publicity in publica-tions such as in VentureBeat, Business Insider, Social Times and The Daily Dot.
He said it’s different than Snapchat and Insta-
gram, two popular photo-sharing apps, because it offers different features such as the friendship feature 
and the fact that it allows users to connect with others 
in their area.
“Bruce had grown tired of the state of current 
social media where there’s a vicarious element to it. It doesn’t inspire you to act, but rather, it’s a mind-less act of scrolling through the experiences of other people,” Koehn said. 
“What he was looking for was something more sincere that encouraged people to go out and live their lives.”
Sobrr protects users’ privacy and information by 
deleting everything in its server 24 hours from when 
it’s posted, he said.
“We’re very strict about privacy. That’s something 
that’s very important to us,” Koehn said.
Joey Friedman, UF alumnus and the president of 
Uber Promotions, compared the app to the iPad mini, 
saying he doesn’t know if there’s a real need for it.
He said that because Snapchat deletes the images 
and videos right away and Facebook keeps the me-dia, he doesn’t see a point for there to be an app for 
“in-between.” Facebook allows people to go back and 
look at media a couple of days later, he said.
He added that he thinks the social media market 
is becoming oversaturated.
Dixie Smith, a 20-year-old UF applied physiol-
ogy and kinesiology junior and Gainesville nightlife promoter, said she thinks people under the inﬂ  uence might use the app but otherwise thinks UF students are pretty careful about what they post on social me-
dia.
“Whatever we post is never truly lost,” she said. 
“And we all have futures to think about.”
She said she thinks the app will get repetitive.
Koehn said that since the app launched in Febru-
ary, it has received more international attention than they were expecting. They have users in countries like Dubai and China and are trying to encourage more usage in the U.S. because that’s where they’re 
based.
The app is free and available at the iTunes App 
Store.‘Sobrr’ app seeks college users RIANA MELENDEZ

High Dive is giving people a 
chance to take advantage of its con-
certs while still saving some extra cash.
For the ﬁ  rst time, the downtown 
venue will be selling season passes for unlimited access to all High Dive and Glory Days Presents concerts scheduled for the fall season.  
“That’s an awesome deal for the 
amount of shows they host,” said 23-year-old Anthony Tran-Son-Tay, a UF business graduate student. “It’s something I would most likely in-
vest in.”
High Dive season passes are be-
ing sold only on TicketWeb through 
July, or until they are sold out, for $119. However, the price rises $10 every Monday, according to High Dive’s TicketWeb webpage.
Patrick Lavery, the owner of the 
High Dive promotion company Glo-
ry Days Presents, said he couldn’t 
say how many tickets are left, but it’s very limited. 
Aside from shows, the pass also 
includes other special bonuses such as a High Dive koozie, special offers and discounts, an invitation to a pri-vate holiday party in December, no under-21 fees and permission to skip 
the line, according to TicketWeb.
Running anywhere between $5 
and $20, High Dive, at 210 SW Sec-ond Ave., holds a number of con-
certs every year for any kind of mu-sic lover, or people who just want to come out and try something new, Lavery said.
“There’s a 
good collection of 
bands throughout 
the year, so there is something for everyone’s prefer-ence,” Tran-Son-Tay said.
The passes are only valid for 
shows scheduled from Aug. 18 to Dec. 30 and do not include charitable 
events or shows hosted by outside 
promoters.
Jose Pineiro, who is a part of the 
local band Duppies that plays regu-larly at High Dive, wrote in an email that the shows are generally great, and it’s a great deal for the consumer and the venue, but for local bands it might be harder to get a proﬁ  t out of 
it. 
It’s customary for High Dive to 
have new, entry-level bands sell a 
set number of tickets, and any prof-its from extra attendance goes to the band. The pass will make it harder to get that number, Pineiro said.
Lavery declined to comment on 
the effect the season passes would 
have on what bands take home.
Tickets bought online will be 
available for pickup around Aug. 1 
at High Dive.Season passes for saleJACKSON HART

Roger Ebert is undoubtedly the 
most popular mainstream ﬁ  lm crit-
ic in American history. People who usually don’t follow ﬁ  lm know his 
name. 
I work at a coffee shop in UF 
Health Shands Hospital and once, 
a young patient, upon overhearing me tell a co-worker I wanted to be 
a ﬁ  lm critic, cried out “Like Ebert!” 
He was the sole reason ﬁ  lm criti-cism moved into the mainstream and continues to exist there. As 
an aspiring critic, there has been no other I have read or respected 
more.
Ebert is the subject of the doc-
umentary, “Life Itself,” which 
opened at The Hippodrome State Theatre Friday. It’s based on his 
memoir of the same title. 
Directed by noted documentar-
ian Steve James, the ﬁ  lm covers 
in equal parts Roger’s declining health in a Chicago rehabilitation facility and his rise to fame. True 
to its name, “Life Itself” is funny, 
devastating, heartwarming and hard to endure.
My last descriptor is not a knock 
but rather a fact: Ebert had his en-
tire lower jaw removed due to can-
cer, and so the footage of him in the hospital is not only gruesome 
but also very sad, because the ﬁ  lm 
shows us that Ebert was a man 
who spoke and laughed a lot. 
More than once during the ﬁ  lm, 
I looked away. I watched this with 
my dad, whose own father had 
gone through a period of decline 
followed by death in the hospital. 
Ebert’s predicament really struck home for us.
My greatest worry going into 
this ﬁ  lm was that it would be a syr-
upy portrait of the man, that James 
would be too intent on memorial-izing his legacy to honestly cover 
all sides of his life. 
To my relief, that was not the 
case at all. The ﬁ  lm describes 
Ebert’s ﬁ  ght with alcoholism, the accusations that his brand of 
criticism was middlebrow and 
pseudo-intellectualist and his con-
tentious and controlling relation-
ship with fellow critic Gene Siskel. While this is undoubtedly a ﬁ  lm that praises Ebert, it doesn’t do so 
unreservedly.
To my surprise, I also laughed a 
lot. Many of the interviewees were 
hilarious, particularly two very old friends of Ebert’s (The line “F**k Pauline Kael!” brought me to tears). 
One of the most inspiring things 
in the ﬁ  lm was what a great sense of humor Ebert himself displayed even through a computer program he typed into. 
“Life Itself” was that kind of 
movie – funny and inspirational even through tragedy. I am usual-ly not a fan of documentaries, but I give this one two thumbs way up.12, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, JULY 24, 2014

Walk into a bookstore, 
browse Amazon cookbook cat-
egory listings, and you’ll ﬁ  nd various genres of cookbooks. There are cookbooks for kids, 
for vegetarians, for couples, for 
one, for beginners and even for dogs. Look closer, and you’ll notice a category of cookbooks for men. But absent is a catego-ry for women, revealing the as-sumption that unmarked cook-books are for women.
There is a lot of gen-
dered discourse we can examine in books like cookbooks for men. The titles themselves are loaded with ste-reotypes: “Man Meets Stove: A Cookbook for Men Who’ve Never Cooked Anything without a Micro-
wave,” “Men’s Health Muscle 
Chow: More than 150 Meals to Feed Your Muscles and Fuel Your Workouts,” and “Eat like a Man: The Only Cookbook a Man will Ever Need.” 
Cookbooks reﬂ  ect the per-
ceptions of masculinity and femininity we have today — and 
so much is the same as from the 
1920s and 1930s and then again in the 1950s (World War II put everything to a pause, including publication of cookbooks). Men eat meat; women eat salad and light, pretty foods; Dad does Sunday pancakes; Mom cooks every day; Dad uses the grill, 
Mom the oven. Of course, these 
antitheses of tastes and cooking techniques don’t always hold true, but these stereotypes per-sist. Why? How so?
Exploring how the media, 
such as cookbooks, spread cul-tural values about women, food and gender roles, historian Jes-
samyn Neuhaus writes about 
meatloaf, a dish that has been served at the American table for decades. She analyzes cook-books and cooking magazines from 1920 to 1960 and shows how meatloaf recipes for wom-en and men were tailored dif-ferently, suggesting that cook-ing for women was a separate 
process than it was for men. 
While women were to make 
the simplest, quickest meat-
loaves, men were encouraged to make more exotic ones to demonstrate their talents as gourmet chefs. For instance, in a 1922 cookbook collection for men, the meatloaf recipe 
called for four different kinds of meat, carefully minced twice by the butcher  and a vari-ety of seasonings and cream. Even something as simple as a recipe for meatloaf, Neuhaus ar-
gues, conveys important mes-
sages about society’s expecta-
tions for women and men’s relation to food.
As Neuhaus’ analysis on 
meatloaf suggests, the foods we consume, how we prepare them and who prepares them reveal important information about ourselves. Particularly, 
gender is intertwined with 
food, because food preparation is assumed to be a woman’s primary domestic responsibil-ity and is tied to her identity. 
In order to understand how 
gender is created in the U.S., it is necessary to understand and reﬂ  ect on how food culture, 
such as cooking literature, has 
shaped and continues to shape our lives. From browsing cook-books to grocery shopping to preparing food, every element of food is intertwined with gen-der.
Hungry for more? See Neu-
haus’ “Is Meatloaf for Men? 
Gender and Meatloaf Recipes, 
1920-1960” in “Cooking Les-sons: The Politics of Gender and Food.”

AlligatorSports continues its Gators 
football position preview by looking at 
the defensive line and linebackers.
There are a number of players 
along the defensive line that will 
have to step into a leadership role 
for 2014. The loss of Dominique Easley — who was drafted in May by the New England Patriots — to an ACL tear early last season was a huge blow to the entire defense’s morale.
One of the new leaders for 2014 
is Dante Fowler, Jr. 
Fowler will start at the Buck po-
sition — a hybrid defensive end/linebacker in Will Muschamp’s de-fensive scheme. 
As a sophomore, he led the team 
in sacks with 3.5 along with seven 
quarterback hurries. His speed and 
explosiveness to get around the edge will once again provide the defense with a strong pass rush. 
If he continues to get off blocks and disrupt quarterbacks this sea-son, Fowler will be at the top of the stat charts by the end of the season again.
Defensive tackle Darious Cum-
mings will look to ﬁ  nish his Gators career on a high note in 2014. He came on strong toward the end of last season, racking up 13 of his 15 
tackles in the ﬁ  nal six games of the 
year.

Of all the NBA offseason 
activities occurring this sum-
mer regarding former Florida 
basketball players, Chandler 
Parsons’ new deal stands above all.
The soon to be four-year 
small forward decided to take up the Dallas Mavericks three-year, $46 million offer on July 10 after the Houston Rockets failed to match it.
With the new contract, Par-
sons became the highest paid player per year ($14.7 million) on the Mavericks roster after 
power forward Dirk Nowitzki 
signed a reduced deal to clear up cap room for the team.
Parsons, a Casselberry, 
Fla., native, is a rising star in 
the league and ﬁ  nished his 
stint with Houston on the rise.
The 6-foot-9, 227-pound 
forward elevated his game last season to new heights by setting career averages in points (16.6), free-throw per-centage (.742), rebounds (5.5) 
and assists (four).
The former Gator ﬁ  lled the 
Rockets’ starting forward po-
sition with 37.6 minutes per 
game, leaving Houston to ﬁ  ll 
a big void.
Rockets center Dwight Howard believes losing him won’t hurt the team. How-ever, Parsons was the third-leading scorer on the squad 
last season.
He will arrive in Dallas 
alongside other offseason ac-
quisitions like Tyson Chan-
dler and Raymond Felton.
Miller rejoins LeBron 
in Cleveland: After win-
ning back-to-back titles with 
the Miami Heat in 2012 and 
2013, Mike Miller will become 
teammates with LeBron James once again.
M i l l e r 
was heavily recruited by 
James and then signed a two-year, 
$5.5 million 
deal with the Cava-
liers, which adds to the depth 
in the newly developing ros-
ter this offseason.
The 34-year-old veteran 
spent last season with the Memphis Grizzlies averaging 
7.1 points in a reserve role, 
but he shot 45.9 percent from the three-point arc.
The three-point specialist 
has been known throughout his career as a shooting threat, and he can add his expertise Gators in the NBA:

JOHNSON’S JOURNAL
What will it take for the Florida foot-
ball fanbase to be satiated? What will it take for it to stop calling for 
Will Muschamp’s head on a silver platter? Some will never be satisﬁ  ed with his de-fense-ﬁ  rst philosophy and I get that. But can the moderates be swayed into believing that Muschamp is making noticeable improve-ments? To ﬁ  nd the answer, I’ll run through win-loss scenarios. 
Double-digit wins are a dream come true 
for this team. Ten wins in the regular season is the logical ceiling for what I think 
this team can do given the talent and the schedule. 
Of course they could luck 
their way to 11 or 12 and the Col-
lege Football Playoff if things 
break the right way like they did in 2012, but that’s unlikely. Ten wins probably means the Gators are sitting pretty in Atlanta if you assume the losses are to Florida State and Alabama. That would mean the Gators would have swept its Eastern Division slate and earned a spot in the Southeast-ern Conference championship game. That would easily placate the fanbase and give Muschamp another year. 
Nine regular season wins 
would also do the trick. Again, I’m assuming losses to FSU and Alabama, which are the two most loaded rosters in the na-
tion. Then the next most logical “L” would be South Carolina, the media’s pick to win the SEC’s Eastern Eivision. If Florida ﬁ  nishes with a 6-2 conference re-
cord, that still means wins over Georgia, LSU and Missouri. That ﬁ  nish would likely place Florida in a New Year’s Day bowl game in either the Capital One or Outback Bowl. It’s 
also a ﬁ  ve-win improvement over 2013’s 4-8 
season. 
Eight regular season wins is the gray area. 
That’s losses to the “Big Two,” the Ol’ Ball Coach’s Gamecocks and most likely a fourth straight loss to the hated Georgia Bulldogs. This is where the vanity of Florida’s season 
How many wins will fans need to see from Muschamp?

ASSOCIATED PRESS
GREENSBORO, N.C. — Jameis 
Winston wants to look to the sea-
son ahead as the Heisman Trophy-
winning quarterback for reigning 
national champion Florida State. He also knows he has to answer questions about his off-ﬁ  eld con-
duct.
“I understand the spotlight,” 
Winston said Sunday on the ﬁ  rst 
of the Atlantic Coast Conference’s two-day preseason kickoff event. 
“I understand what it is to be a 
leader and I’m bettering myself every single day to hold myself to that standard that everyone views 
me as, you know? Because I’m on 
a pedestal. Other players don’t get the privilege of being on that ped-estal.”
Winston was investigated for 
sexual assault during last season. A prosecutor in Tallahassee, Fla., decided in December not to charge 
him due to a lack of evidence and 
gaps in the accuser’s story.
Then in April, he was cited for 
walking out of a supermarket with-out paying for crab legs.
He did not address speciﬁ  cs 
of the incident Sunday during an hour-long interview session that had about 60 reporters crowded 
around his table. Instead, he fo-
cused on working to become a better leader and player with the support of family, teammates and coaches.“I have a certain standard that 
I’ve got to hold myself up to, and 
if I go even an inch below that stan-
dard, it’s going to be chaos.”
Asked if it was a difﬁ  cult lesson 
to learn, Winston said, “It wasn’t 
difﬁ  cult at all because you learn 
from your mistakes in this world. I learned from my mistakes, I ﬁ  xed it and I moved on into preparing for this season.”
Miami running back Duke 
Johnson described Winston as “a kid still” and said Winston does not seem bothered by outside criti-
cism.
“He likes to have fun, he likes 
to play around, and a lot of people 
take that out of (context) and make it bigger than what it really is,” Johnson said. “But I don’t believe Jameis means any harm in what 
he does or anything he may have 
done in the past.”
Winston seemed at ease with 
the attention and prepared for the questions Sunday. He started his 
interview by pointing out that the 
ACC, not the Southeastern Con-ference, won last year’s national championship and playfully asked reporters for a round of applause.At times leaning back with his 
hands behind his head, Winston 
talked about improving his me-
chanics by holding the ball higher to shorten his throwing motion, his hope of becoming a pro in both 
football and baseball and how he 
was more focused on winning a second title than a second Heis-man.
As for whether people might be 
hesitant to believe he has learned from his past?
“I deﬁ  nitely understand that 
. . . but I know the type of person 
that I am,” he said. “I know I have 
support from my teammates and I know that I was raised by a great family. So that’s the least of my worries, what people think.”
Winston prepares for upcoming season in national spotlight
“I have a certain standard 
that I’ve got to hold myself 
up to, and if I go even an 
inch below that standard, 
it’s going to be chaos.”

FSU quarterbackalligator awardsJORDAN MCPHERSON
and EDEN OTERO
Alligator Staff Writers
As part of the Alligator Awards 
recognizing the best in UF athlet-
ics during the 2013-14 season, staff 
writers Jordan McPherson and Eden 
Otero will debate two of the ﬁ  ve nominees for best female athlete. 
Check out the rest of the nominees 
in the graphic below. And be sure to vote for the winner online at alliga-torSports.org.
Eden: During the 2013-2014 
season, we saw a lot of female 
athletes do incredible things, but 
Kytra Hunter was the best.
Hunter quite possibly had the 
best season of her entire gymnas-
tics career in 2014. 
She completed the year with 
six perfect scores — two on vault 
and four on ﬂ  oor — and helped the team repeat for a second 
straight national title.
Her performance this season 
made her the strongest athlete for 
Florida, and that’s saying some-
thing considering the team boasts 
two Olympians — Bridget Sloan 
and Alaina Johnson — and two 
sisters who were dubbed to go to 
the Olympics — Mackenzie Ca-quatto and Bridgette Caquatto. And by the way, Bridgette Ca-
quatto went to the Pan-American 
Games and won on a shattered kneecap, so that’s saying a lot.
It’s not easy to stand out in a 
crowd that is as talented as this one.
But Hunter set herself apart 
from the rest of the pack with 
perfection throughout the 2014 
season.Jordan: Hunter had a great 
year, but are you sure she was the best on her team? 
Sloan paced the team in all-
around scores in nine of its 14 
events, forcing Hunter to play 
second-ﬁ  ddle to the sophomore Olympian. 
The Alligator Award without 
a doubt deserves to go to volley-ball’s Chloe Mann.
The senior middle blocker led 
the country with a .506 hitting percentage and led the Gators 
with 369 kills while committing 
just 47 errors.
Do you remember the last time 
a UF player notched a hitting per-
centage above .500 in a season? It 
hasn’t.
In fact, the only other time a 
player managed a hitting clip that high in a year with the current 
scoring format was when Penn 
State’s Arielle Wilson notched a .540 mark back in 2009.
Mann’s outstanding ﬁ  nal year 
at UF gave her a .476 career hit-ting percentage — the best in NCAA history.
Mann carried her team on her 
back. Hunter had help.
Eden: Hunter may have had some help, but that’s what a team needs to win a national champi-onship. 
Do you see a title ring on 
Mann’s ﬁ  nger right now? Be-
cause I don’t.
If Mann was really the best 
female athlete, she would have 
been able to help lead her team 
past the second round of the 
NCAA Finals in 2013.
I know it seems low to fault 
her for not having teammates to help her bring home a title, but 
that is key in being a strong ath-
lete — to be able to inspire and push your teammates. 
Hunter has become a leader 
alongside Sloan because she can see that in order to win, she’s go-ing to need help. 
Jordan: If this rally was for the 
best team, then clearly you have 
me beat. But it’s not.
This Alligator Award is about 
the best female ATHLETE — a 
single competitor. 
And no one who played a 
sport on UF’s campus this season was as much of a competitor as Mann.
Let’s face it, Mann was the fo-
cal point of Florida volleyball’s offense last season. She led or tied for the team lead in kills on 14 occasions in 2013 and had double-digit kill mark in 22 of UF’s 32 matches.
Her contributions on defense 
were noted as well, ﬁ  nishing second on the team with 91 total blocks compared to just 13 block-
ing errors.
I’m not discrediting what 
Hunter has accomplished, but if 
you removed her from the line-up, Rhonda Faehn’s squad still 
would have found success.
If Mann wasn’t on the team, 
Florida volleyball would have 
gone nowhere.
Eden: Are you really saying 
that Mann is the LeBron James of the volleyball team? 
Because that’s a bit of an exag-
geration.
Don’t get me wrong. Mann 
had a hell of a season, but so did Hunter.
I disagree that Faehn would 
have been able to replace her. 
The only other gymnast for 
Florida that ever proved to be as good as Hunter (and could ad-
equately replace her because let’s 
be real here, she WON the ﬂ  oor exercise 11 of 13 times this season and six of those were consecutive) on the ﬂ  oor was Bridget Sloan.
And you can’t replace Hunter 
with someone that is already 
competing in the event. 
Not to mention, if they lost 
Hunter then they would lose one 
of their best all-around competi-
tors.
I will also point out that many 
of the secondaries on Faehn’s ros-
ter were suffering from some sort of injury.
Lauren Rose, someone who 
could replace Hunter on the vault has had serious issues with her achilles tendon for the last three 
years.
Rachel Spicer, despite being  
really good on the ﬂ  oor, would 
not be able to make up for what the Gators would lose if Hunter 
wasn’t performing.
And Jamie Shisler hasn’t 
shown a consistent performance 
in the last year.
Mark my words, Hunter is go-
ing to be talked about for seasons to come when she graduates be-cause that’s what happens when 
you break records left and right 
in a single season.THURSDAY, JULY 24, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 19

Miller also had interest in other teams, including 
the Denver Nuggets. 
Beal joins Team USA camp roster for FIBA World 
Cup: Out of a 19-man training camp roster Team USA 
has compiled, Bradley Beal is the lone Wizards repre-
sentative.
Beal has an opportunity to land on the permanent 
12-man team that will compete during the FIBA Bas-ketball World Cup starting Aug. 30 in Spain.
The training camp will run through July 28 to Aug. 
1 in Las Vegas where Beal can work for a roster spot 
against stars like Kevin Durant and James Harden.
After edging out teammate John Wall on the roster, 
Beal will battle alongside former Gator Chandler Par-
sons as they headline past Florida greats.
But it won’t be easy for either player to make the 
roster.
Durant, Harden, Kevin Love and Anthony Davis 
all played on the USA team that won gold in the 2012 Olympics in London.
In addition, players like Derrick Rose, Blake Grif-
ﬁ  n, Stephen Curry and Paul George all look to have a guaranteed spot due to their elevated play on the court.
Beal’s chances can be limited to a few due to veter-
an players, leaving the Wizards guard with no choice but to deliver.comes to the forefront. 
With the talent at the skill positions as well 
as how new offensive coordinator Kurt Rop-
er plans to maximize it, this team shouldn’t 
rank in the bottom half of offensive catego-
ries, much less its abysmal 115th in yards per game, 110th in yards per play and 116th in total yards. If Florida can show an overly competent offense on its way to an 8-4 year, it might just be good enough. 
There may need to be a ﬂ  uky quality about 
one of its four losses, something easily ex-plained away by the fans. A bad call on the 
road in Alabama or a 50-yard heart break-
ing ﬁ  eld goal as the clock ticks down against South Carolina may be enough to rationalize 8-4. 
Seven wins is where things get dicey. 
Without 2013’s cosmic over-regression to the mean, seven wins is likely where last season should have ended up. And the Gators were close with four losses last season coming by 
six points or less. 
But seven wins in 2014 likely means a loss 
to the four given above and then a stubbed toe 
against Missouri on homecoming or a Tennes-see team that could enter the Oct. 4 meeting with a 1-3 record or a second straight loss to Vanderbilt. 
That’s now one 6-6 regular season, one 4-8 
regular season, one 7-5 regular season and 
an 11-2 outlier that will look even more ﬂ  uky 
than it already was. 
Seven wins in my estimation won’t be 
good enough for a majority of folks that want Will Muschamp gone to stop their pleas to athletics director Jeremy Foley. 
A 4-8 record in Gainesville is something 
Muschamp may never recover from in the minds of Gator fans. If he’s going to have a 
chance, he’s going to have to win.20, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, JULY 24, 2014

COLUMN , from page 17Florida loses Powell, but welcomes back Taylor and Morrison
fractured wrist, but he will be ready for fall 
camp. 
Orr is the likely candidate to win the start-
ing nose tackle job this fall. He played in all 12 games last year, including the South Carolina 
contest on Nov. 16 when he tied his career-
high of four tackles.
Jon Bullard saw reps at defensive tackle frequently in 2013 due to Easley’s injury, but he should be back at defensive end when the season starts Aug. 30. He ﬁ  nished second among defensive linemen with 33 tackles last year. With Fowler on the other end, the two have the potential to be one of the best pass rushing duos in the Southeastern Confer-ence.
The linebacker corps will be without Ron-
ald Powell this season, but it will welcome back Michael Taylor and Antonio Morrison.  Redshirt senior Neiron Ball should be tak-
ing over for Powell at the Sam position. Ball has the veteran experience to lead the group 
having played in 36 games over his career at Florida. His best game last season came 
against South Carolina when he had a career-
high six tackles. Ball ﬁ  nished the year with 25 
tackles.
Taylor returns to the roster after lead-ing the team in total tackles (62) last season. However, he will have to battle with sopho-more Jarrad Davis for the starting Mike spot. He had 24 total tackles last season and was named a team captain for the Missouri and South Carolina games.
Morrison is back fully healthy after a knee 
injury ended his season in the Vanderbilt 
game. Despite missing the last three games of 
the season, he ﬁ  nished the year second on the team with 56 total tackles.
