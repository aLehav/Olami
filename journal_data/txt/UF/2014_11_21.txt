A dark cloud is hanging over the Florida 
football program.
In two weeks, its leader, its head man, will 
be out of commission.
Questions are abundant.
Uncertainties are swirling.
But this Saturday, when Florida (5-4, 4-4 
Southeastern Conference) takes on Eastern Kentucky (9-2, 6-2 Ohio Valley Conference) in its game at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium, the Gators look to provide a glimmer of brightness to a program that has been enveloped in darkness since Sunday afternoon.

Florida’s season has not gone as expected.Following a 4-8 outing in 2013, changes 
needed to be made.
Problems needed to be addressed.Ties were hanging by a thread.But after starting the year with a 3-1 record 
— with its lone loss coming against then-No. 3 and current No. 1 Alabama on the road —  and the season looking as if it was heading in the 
right direction, the Gators have gone into a tail-
spin.
Back-to-back losses at home against LSU and 
Missouri put Florida at an even .500 record and head coach Will Muschamp on the hot seat.
And while Florida responded with an upset 
win against Georgia and a road victory against Vanderbilt, the final dagger in Muschamp’s tenure as Florida’s head man came last Satur-
day against South Carolina when playing con-
servatively with a 17-10 lead heading into the fourth quarter proved to be costly.“I think we have tried to do the best of our 
ability to play to our strengths in some situa-tions and hasn’t always been exactly what we all perceived that we wanted,” Muschamp said. “But the reality is I felt like we do some things we need to do to be successful and we came up short in some situations, especially this year.”
After taking their first lead of the game with 
1:56 remaining in the third quarter, the Gators 
ran the ball on all but two offensive snaps for 
the rest of the game.
“Really our mentality got into after the Mis-
souri game, is let’s not beat ourselves,” offen-sive coordinator Kurt Roper said. 
They gained 42 yards on 21 plays — a two-
yard average.
“We really felt like we found our identity and 
had a chance with some good field position in 
the fourth quarter to make it a two score game 
within that mentality, if that makes sense,” Roper said. “And we didn’t get it done.”
Offensive ineptitude and a duo of blocked 
kicks ultimately did Florida — and Muschamp — in, as the Gators lost to the Gamecocks 23-20 in overtime and Muschamp lost his job less than 24 hours later.
“We didn’t win enough football games, 
that’s the bottom line,” Muschamp said. “You’ve got to win games.  We didn’t get that done. Very disappointed and frustrated that did not happen. Certainly had our opportuni-ties, especially this year, keeping a healthy ros-ter and having the opportunity to win football games, and we didn’t get it done.”

Senior Day is supposed to be an exciting 
time for a head coach.
This day, the seniors’ last home game of their collegiate career, is supposed to be a time of reflection before the players run off their home field for one last time.
But Muschamp probably didn’t think he 
would be leaving with them.
Saturday is Muschamp’s final game that he 
can call The Swamp home.
“It’s always an emotional day,” Muschamp 
said. “Then couple with that knowing it will be my last game in The Swamp, it will certainly be emotional for me as far as those things are concerned. I’m just looking forward to it in a lot of ways, and certainly when it’s over I will be disappointed.”
The Gators have lost their last three games 
at home and six of their last eight.Muschamp does not want his second straight 
senior class to leave The Swamp with a loss.
“Senior Day is a huge day for our guys … 
(to) send them out on the right note,” Mus-champ said.
And his players want to send Muschamp 
out the right way, too.
“I feel like I have to win,” senior offensive 
lineman Trenton Brown said. “All of us feel like we have to win to send all our seniors out of our last home game with a win and to send ‘Champ out with a win. It’s like his senior night, too.”
Added senior tight end Tevin Westbrook: 
“Just a lot of emotion, it being the last time me running out of the tunnel. And to have ‘Champ there, knowing it’s his last game, it will definite-ly be an emotional game. But we’ll try not to let that get in the way of us this weekend because emotions tend to stir up the game sometimes.”

While Muschamp will no longer be em-
ployed at UF once December rolls around, he plans to make the most of the last two weeks he is here.
That starts this Saturday against Eastern 
Kentucky.
“In the season it’s game planning and get-
ting ready for the next game,” Muschamp said. “Obviously dealing with what we dealt with Sunday and Monday in the press conference, you just keep moving on.”
While the Colonels are a Football Champi-
onship Subdivision team, they don’t look to be 
a pushover team on paper.
On offense, Eastern Kentucky is averaging 
243.1 rushing yards per game and is led in the 
ground game by Kentucky transfer Dy’Shawn Mobley, who has 1,372 rushing yards and 19 touchdowns.
Defensively, EKU has forced 30 turnovers 
and is holding opponents to a 38-percent third-down conversion rate.
Florida isn’t going to take Eastern Kentucky 
for granted.
“I don’t know if it’s just the 12th game or 
however you want to phrase it, but it’s consis-tency in performance, no matter who you’re playing,” defensive coordinator D.J. Durkin said. “If you’re playing the best team on your schedule or whoever they are. A conference team, a rival, this, that, it’s about playing con-
sistently. That’s the challenge for our guys.”
And Saturday’s matchup has implications 
that extend further than the emotional stand-
point.
A win makes the Gators bowl eligible.A loss puts them back at .500, which means 
a loss to Florida State on Nov. 29 would give Florida back-to-back losing seasons for the first time since the 1978 and 1979 seasons.
“I want to go out the right way,” redshirt 
senior center Max Garcia said. “I feel like the younger guys are going to make sure we’re going to do that and obviously go out to Tal-lahassee and win that game also. We’re playing for each other, we’re playing for Muschamp, we’re playing for Gator Nation. Nothing has changed.”

Florida coach Will Muschamp turns away from a time-out talk with the Gators offense during Florida’s 30-27 loss to LSU on Oct. 11 at Ben Hill 
Griffin Stadium. The loss to LSU was the first of three straight home losses for Muschamp this season, which ultimately cost him his job.

Just four short years after it began, the sun is setting on 
the Will Muschamp Era in Gainesville. Believe it or not, 
Coach “Boom” has just two games — Eastern Kentucky and a road game at Florida State — left on the horizon. 
Saturday’s game against Eastern Kentucky is the last 
home game of the 2014 season, which means that it is also Senior Day, which makes it a special last game in The Swamp for both the seniors and Muschamp.Junior Buck linebacker Dante Fowler Jr., who declared 
for the 2015 NFL Draft via Twitter on Tuesday evening and will be playing his last game in Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Sta-dium on Saturday, said it is difﬁ  cult to see the coach who he came in with leave after such a short period of time. 
“It’s hard when you’re man that basically recruited 
you to come in, that was my recruiter really, my defensive coach, basically my defensive coordinator, and just to see him go and just to see how great of a guy he is, to see how far he’s come ever since he ﬁ  rst stepped, you know, a foot on campus,” Fowler said.This week’s game against Eastern Kentucky will also 
most likely be the last game for Muschamp’s coaching staff, including Florida’s ﬁ  rst-year offensive coordinator Kurt Roper. 
Roper was one of the more intriguing hires of the off-
season last year, and was suspected to make positive ad-justments on offense immediately due to his success at Duke the previous six seasons. 
However, with inconsistent quarterback play from 
Jeff Driskel and a conservative approach being evident throughout the season, the offense is averaging just 29.3 points per game, which is tied for ninth in the Southeast-ern Conference and tied for 65th in the country. 
Florida is also ranked 90th in the country in total of-
fense.
Roper said that the challenges of going through three 
offensive coordinators in four years could have been one of the reasons why the scheme wasn’t completely success-ful in Year 1. 
“That was one of the beneﬁ  ts of being at Duke six 
years,” Roper said. “Everybody that went through that system heard the same language for six years. There were no changes in vocabulary. That’s been one of the chal-
lenges for these guys offensively. It’s been the third guy 
in however many years it is, so that obviously is a chal-lenge.” 
Defensive coordinator D.J. Durkin, who was on Flor-
ida’s staff as the linebackers coach under Urban Meyer before Muschamp was hired, talked Wednesday about sending the seniors and coaches out on a positive note Saturday. 
“We need to as a team — coaches, players alike — go 
perform really well for those guys and send them off the right way out of The Swamp,” Durkin said.
It may feel like it began just yesterday, but Saturday will 
be one of the last two times Gator fans will see Muschamp on the sideline as Florida’s head coach. The same Mus-champ, who as a boy who grew up in Gainesville cheering for the Gators, will take one last ﬁ  nal bow working his dream job as the Gators’ head coach in The Swamp.
“That’s my coach still,” cornerback Brian Poole said. 
“Whether or not he’s here, I still consider him as my coach, as like a father ﬁ  gure to me.”
But for right now, it’s just business as usual.“It’s going to be the same,” linebacker Mike Taylor 
said. 
“They won’t change. We won’t change. We’ll go out 
there. We’ll work. I’ll cherish my last couple weeks here. They’ll cherish their last couple weeks here. We’ll all cher-ish and enjoy this time because things will be a lot differ-ent next year. Just enjoying the here and now is what I can imagine it will be like.”Final home game could be the last for Florida coaching staff

Sara Shourds woke up at 12:30 
a.m. Thursday to a missed call 
from her twin sister, Natalie, a 
Florida State University fresh-
man.
Not wanting to disturb her 
roommate, Shourds, 19, a UF 
nursing freshman, texted her 
back to make sure everything was okay — Natalie never calls that late.
“There’s a man with a gun that 
just shot at someone on the ﬁ  rst ﬂ  oor,” Natalie wrote back. “I’m hiding with everyone else on the second ﬂ  oor. Just know that I love you, Sara.”
Shourds said she leapt out 
of bed, shaking so hard she had trouble getting the key in the door handle.
“I was super scared,” she said. 
“I was tearing up picturing her being shot.”
But Natalie said she was ﬁ  ne, 
hiding behind bookshelves with 
a group of people. When the gun-
man was caught, she hung up and Gainesville community comes together for FSU vigilsFlorida State holds together

TALLAHASSEE — Tatiana Aponte said 
Strozier Library was a safe place. 
The Florida State University senior made it 
her nightly home freshman year — a comfort-
ing refuge after her grueling dance classes. 
But just before 12:30 a.m. Thursday, that 
refuge was bathed in fear. A gunman, later identiﬁ  ed by police as Myron May, walked into the library and opened ﬁ  re, injuring three 
people before he was killed after exchanging 
shots with police. 
After working on a group project for 
about four hours, the marketing and hospital-ity management major needed another cup of coffee. She headed to the ﬁ  rst-ﬂ  oor Star-bucks with Cassie Villanueva, 19. Everything seemed normal. 
Aponte ordered a tall dark blend before 
running into another group. They stopped to chat. That’s when they noticed the library’s atmosphere started to change. 
Students were shifting, like a silent herd 
escaping an oncoming predator. They quietly shufﬂ  ed from one side of the ﬁ  rst ﬂ  oor to the other. Some hid behind pillars. 
A sharp beeping sound sliced through the 
air. 
“A ﬁ  ght is breaking out,” Aponte, 21, 
thought. 
Then an alarm blared. “A ﬁ  re alarm?” Aponte and her friends ducked from their 
spot at Starbucks as students began to move more urgently, picking up their backpacks and laptops and emptying the ﬁ  rst ﬂ  oor, many rushing up the stairs. 
People don’t run up the stairs in a ﬁ  re, she 
realized. 
That’s when Aponte started moving to-
ward the stairs too. On the way up, she turned to Villanueva.
“Everyone needs to calm down,” Aponte 
said. “We don’t even know what’s going on.” 
A girl she didn’t know then whispered in 
her ear:
“There is a guy with a gun on this ﬂ  oor.”
■   ■   ■
If you search May on Facebook, his proﬁ  le 
picture shows a smiling face and a bow tie. 
The gunman graduated from FSU in 2005 
before graduating from Texas Tech Law School four years later, according to Tallahas-see Police. May had licenses to practice law in Texas and New Mexico but had recently returned to the Tallahassee area. The 31-year-old had no criminal record 
in Florida. He served as chairman of the Na-tional Black Law Students Association, Rocky Mountain Region. The Phi Beta Sigma Frater-nity member also received a scholarship from 
the African-American Collegiate Scholarship 
Fund. 
Yet on Thursday morning, the FSU alum-
nus opened ﬁ  re in Strozier.
He shot at one employee before trying to 
shoot another woman just inside the lobby entrance. 
Then May reloaded his gun. He shot at two male students outside of the 
building. One was grazed and released on the scene, and the other, Nathan Scott, was shot through the leg but is in good condition, ac-cording to Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare. 
In two minutes campus police confronted 
May in cooperation with Tallahassee Police

� DECISION WAS UNANIMOUS.
LIZ CLANCY
Alligator Contributing Writer
Three men puffed smoke from 
their glossy vape pens outside 
Gainesville’s city hall in defeat.
The city commission passed an 
ordinance Thursday banning the 
use of electronic cigarettes where 
smoking is already prohibited.
The men — Kevin Skipper, Ter-
ryl Bowen and Eric Lievers — stood before Mayor Ed Braddy and a pan-el of commissioners in an attempt to stop or delay the decision.
“You still have the opportunity 
tonight to make a decision to table 
this discussion and let us come back 
and present to you some facts, be-cause it doesn’t sound like you’ve had all of them,” Skipper, the presi-dent of the nonproﬁ  t organization VISTA Truth that promotes vaping business, said to the commissioners. He suggested holding an informa-tional workshop about e-cigarettes 
in a month.
In a public debate, before ad-
dressing the ordinance, Braddy said 
attendees could speak in favor of e-cigarettes but will most likely not change the  decision.
Braddy’s words proved true: 
Skipper’s proposal was unaccepted by the commissioners, and the ordi-nance had already been approved unanimously in the ﬁ  rst round.
Commissioner at large Lauren 
Poe said people would not like the use of e-cigarettes in public because it is still an addictive substance.
“We do not want this product 
to be used in public environments 
where there may be underage peo-
ple that do not know the difference between a cigarette and a vape de-vice,” he said.
Poe said things might change in 
the next ﬁ  ve years if public percep-tion of e-cigarettes changes.
“Right now, I don’t think this is 
right for Gainesville,” he said. 
Skipper said his biggest concern 
was having e-cigarettes lumped in the same category as tobacco prod-ucts, which, unlike e-cigarettes, have been proven lethal.
“We don’t deal with perception, 
we deal with reality,” he said. “And 
the reality is that 1,100 Americans 
die every day from smoking or some sort of tobacco-related illness.”
Commissioner at large Helen

Aponte made it to the third ﬂ  oor as stu-
dents kept shifting inside. That’s when she heard the gunshots. 
Six to 10 pops pierced the cold, 29-degree 
night.
“We started running,” she said. In the craze to ﬁ  nd a hiding place, she 
passed students crying, sprinting and feeling 
disoriented in the chaos.
She hid behind a table at the back of the 
ﬂ  oor. 
Scared, she texted a group of friends: 
Aponte: “There’s a guy with a gun I stroz 
(sic)”
Aponte: “Heard gun shots.”Friend: “Serious?” Aponte: “Dead.”
Aponte: “Im shaking.”
Then later, “Get to the bathroom or some-
thing,” one told her. “Go hide,” said another. 
An intercom message told students to call 
911 if anyone was injured. Another announce-ment said police apprehended the shooter. Evacuations would start soon.
Aponte said all around her students were 
crying. Others had glassy eyes from past tears. Some looked tired. Others were in shock. 
When ofﬁ  cers arrived on Aponte’s ﬂ  oor, 
she was led downstairs with her hands in the air. 
The scariest part, she said, were the guns. Below her, ofﬁ  cers pointed hefty machine 
guns up the stairwell.
“If you made any brief movement, they 
were going to aim it at you,” she said. 
Students were evaluated and then guided 
into nearby Bellamy Hall. It wasn’t until after 4 a.m. when Aponte climbed into bed.

Thursday afternoon, on the police website, 
Tallahassee Police hinted at a troubled mind.
Ofﬁ  cers said May kept journal entries and 
videos in which he expressed fear that the government was targeting him. His Facebook page was ﬂ  ooded with Bible verses. But his motive for the school shooting remains un-clear. 
In the aftermath, clusters of students 
gathered behind the yellow caution tape sur-rounding Strozier. Two men nailed wood panels over ﬁ  rst-ﬂ  oor windows as a police of-
ﬁ  cer in a bulletproof vest stood watch in the 
sun.Business freshmen Amber Strokoff and 
Olivia Delashmutt, both 18, sat on the sunny 
lawn outside the library in FSU garnet. 
Like many students who lived near Stro-
zier, the two were alerted when alarms went 
off. 
“I was so nervous,” Strokoff said. “I threw 
up a few times.” 
“You never think it’s going to happen,” 
Delashmutt said. “And it does. Why our school?” 
It was a question many were asking. At about 5 p.m., a mass of about 800 people 
came together near FSU’s bronze Integration statue in solidarity for the three victims.
Many held burning candles and nearly all 
wore garnet, gold and black. 
FSU President John Thrasher addressed 
the crowd that spilled over into bushes, on benches and even to the top ﬂ  oor of the near-
by parking garage. 
“The world is watching you right now, 
Florida State University,” Thrasher said. 
“This university is not going to let any indi-vidual divide us, conquer us, or make us any less than what we are.” 
The marching band led the group in a 
rendition of the alma mater. A swaying sea of somber faces and furrowed brows fought 
back tears and moved together with the mu-
sic. A handful of scattered students in the back 
started the FSU war chant. The chant picked 
up like wildﬁ  re, growing and crescendoing 
through the crowd as drums accompanied it. 
“I can’t hear you!” someone screamed, 
and the chanting grew. 
For a few minutes through teary eyes, ev-
eryone — students, staff, band members, pro-fessors, politicians — were one.

The scars from the Strozier shooting will 
take time to heal. 
Aponte said she woke up Thursday morn-
ing feeling OK. She watched an episode of “Grey’s Anatomy,” got in touch with family and friends and talked to roommates.
“And I was ﬁ  ne,” she repeated. “I felt 
ﬁ  ne.”
It wasn’t until she ﬁ  nally saw May’s Face-
book page — his face staring back at her — 
that her anxiety returned. 
As she recalled her night, a police car 
rushed down West Tennessee Street, sirens 
blaring. She snapped her neck back to see where the noise was coming from, tried to talk again, but followed the patrol car with her eyes until it was out of sight. 
“You think a bunch of thoughts,” she said 
when she composed herself again. 
“The whole situation, I just have a bad 
feeling, and it just won’t go away.”“You never think it’s going to happen. And it does. Why our school?”4, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 21, 2014

followed the evacuation protocol, 
where she walked through metal detectors and was patted down 
twice. She was held in a lecture 
hall near the library until 4 a.m. Classes were canceled that day, so she didn’t have to go to her 8 
a.m. lab or take the trigonometry 
test she had been studying for.
The shooting at FSU’s Stro-
zier Library brought UF students together around campus Thurs-
day.
Some students came together 
in prayer at Gator Wesley. They 
bowed their heads, joining hands 
as they prayed for FSU. Some 
students were near tears as they spoke about how fragile and pre-cious life is.  
Danielle Russell, a 19-year-old 
UF animal science sophomore, drew a heart and colored it in with orange, blue, red and yellow crayons to send FSU Wesley.There were no Gators and no 
Seminoles — only unity.
“This is a terrible thing,” Rus-
sell said of the shooting. “I love how UF and FSU have been able to come together.”
Praying gives Russell a sense 
of security and hope, she said. Faith replaced her fear as she came together with her fellow ministry members.
Farther down West Univer-
sity Avenue, four UF students followed their missionary to the wooden pews in the St. Augus-
tine Church. They repeated Hail 
Marys under the jewel-toned stained-glass windows as they prayed for the victims, the stu-
dents and the shooter’s family.
“I feel at peace that the hearts 
and lives of those involved are in God’s hands,” said Kaitelyn Mill-
er, the church’s missionary.
Brittany Petrelli, 19, said 
prayer is the best form of love.
“We’re showing the way we 
love FSU and those affected,” the UF linguistics sophomore said.
Others looked to the legisla-
ture to make change. UF alumnus Naveen Mudaliar called Sen. Doc Renuart on Thursday to bring up 
the issue of concealed carry.
“I said I had an opinion for 
the representative about a law 
change that has to be made,” Mu-daliar, 24, said. “I told them that 
I think the legislature should take 
up allowing concealed carry for adults on Florida’s public univer-sity campuses.”
Mudaliar said he thinks it’s 
important to expand the con-cealed carry law to include col-lege campuses because criminals don’t follow the law and will 
bring guns to campus to commit 
mass shootings, robberies and rape.
“Students and faculty are pro-
hibited to protect themselves, and I think that there should be a law change allowing that,” he said.
Mudaliar said he has called 
the Senate before on this issue, 
and he plans to do so again in 
spring when the legislature is back in session.
“I’ve been thinking about gun 
issues for some time, and my views aren’t in response to the shooting,” he said. “But I hope some good will come from chang-ing the law.”
UF President Bernie Machen 
released a statement Thursday addressing the FSU shooting.
“I know everyone in the Uni-
versity of Florida community joins me in sending our heart-felt thoughts and prayers to the victims and to the entire FSU community,” Machen wrote in 
a statement. “Today, we are all 
FSU.”
UF Senate President Joseph 
Michaels said he and other sena-
tors are drafting a piece of legis-
lation to highlight the collegiate camaraderie with FSU.
“It’s important that we do 
support the university at this 
time and throughout the year,” 
Michaels said.
The bill will be presented at 
next Tuesday’s Senate meeting.
“It’s emphasizing how impor-tant it is we have a strong rela-
tionship, but also sharing our 
sentiment in regarding the well-being of those families,” Michaels said.
Shourds said she is relieved her 
sister left the scene unharmed.
“She’s my very best friend in 
the whole world,” Shourds said. “She told me I’m the ﬁ  rst per-
son she thinks of to call for any-
thing.”

Millennials have a bad reputation for being emo-
tionally distant, lazy and unfulﬁ  lled. During my time here at UF, I have tried to counteract 
this generalization.
This week, I turned 21  . As I reach this milestone in my 
life, I have learned about what it means to be an adult and 
ﬁ  gure things out on my own. Here are a couple life lessons 
to take into account:
The ﬁ  rst lesson is simple: Mind your business. You 
will ﬁ  nd that the majority of problems you encounter 
can be avoided by simply staying out of things that don’t concern you. 
This may sound harsh, but staying out of drama and 
avoiding the urge to pry into other people’s social or ro-mantic relationships will give you free time to do some-thing more productive.
Next, be proactive. Ask that special person out on a 
date. Text the friend you fell out of touch with ﬁ  rst. Be quick to apologize and ask for forgiveness. If you think something is cute, wear it — nobody of importance will hate it anyway. Remember you have the same amount of time in the day as Beyoncé, so act accordingly.
The next lesson: Words mean things. We have all 
messed up and said things we shouldn’t have in our lives. But the true test of character is what you do with that. 
For example, Don Lemon on CNN told a sexual as-
sault victim there were ways she could have stopped the assault. The victim blaming was clear in this case, and he received major backlash for it. Later on he apolo-
gized for it. 
One thing I realized is that if you know better, you 
do better. As people grow, they will come to know what 
should be said and what shouldn’t be said.
Maya Angelou taught me the next lesson. She said, 
“When someone shows you who they are, believe them the ﬁ  rst time.” First impressions and inter-
actions are really important, especially when it comes to re-
lationships. When you see red 
ﬂ  ags and something is telling you to go in the other direction, don’t ignore that voice in your 
head.
And ﬁ  nally: Love yourself. 
Being authentic 100 percent of the time is both the easi-
est and hardest job in the world. Nobody is going to love you the right way if self love doesn’t happen ﬁ  rst. 
This is especially difﬁ  cult when society expects you 
to live up to harmful stereotypes and generalizations. Loving yourself includes not comparing yourself to other people and their achievements. 
For example, many college students get depressed 
seeing Facebook statuses of their friends hanging out and having a good time. 
Facebook only lists people’s accomplishments, not 
their failures, and no one can truly know what people 
are going through just by looking at their online pro-
ﬁ  les. Compliment yourself. Admire and be proud of your body. Take tons of selﬁ  es. 
Long story short: You’re allowed to be happy. Don’t 
let anyone tell you otherwise.
With these ideals in mind, you should also accept the 
fact that some days will be better than others, and that is OK. You’ll eventually see positivity as a result. 
By following these simple instructions, I believe that 
millennials across the country can lead better lives. Oprah Winfrey once said something I’ll never forget: “Not only are you responsible for your life, but doing the best at this moment puts you in the best place for 
the next moment.”

umns appear on Fridays.Reﬂ  ecting on a 
tragedy
As you have probably noticed by now, we normally go 
casual on Fridays with a quirky, tongue-in-cheek “Darts and Laurels” summing up the best and worst of the 
week. But on Thursday night, the Alligator staff was in no mood to chide silliness and applaud reason. Anything we could have 
written in this space feels trivial compared to what dominated 
Florida State University students’ thoughts, prayers and social media newsfeeds in the past 24 hours.
This tragedy falls uncannily close to Thanksgiving, when we 
should be grateful for many things — particularly that no in-nocent lives were taken. There has been one death: the gunman, who exchanged gunﬁ  re with police and was fatally shot just outside Strozier Library. As of Thursday night, there were three victims: one released from the hospital, one in stable condition 
and another in critical condition. We hope that all victims — and 
students who were in the library that night — recover physi-cally, emotionally and mentally.
The photos, videos and social media posts from early Thurs-
day morning out of Tallahassee are chilling, with uneasy an-nouncements over the intercom asking students to call 911 if they or someone they know is wounded. Names scribbled on white boards to let parents know their children are alive. Text messages alerting parents of a gunman in the building before 
any news alert was blasted.
We all remember Virginia Tech, Sandy Hook and Santa 
Monica College. All schools smeared with connotation after de-
ranged gunmen entered peaceful areas designated for education and opened ﬁ  re. We’ve read about these events, shared articles online and watched them unfold from a safe distance.
Just 149 miles away from Library West, Strozier Library at 
FSU was too close to home.
We are not immune to tragedy. We are not immortal. By 
chance, the gunman happened to pick FSU. We will never truly know his motives.
And we will never know when it could happen here.Aggregated social media posts from Yik Yak, Twitter and 
Facebook that were published on Buzzfeed, Gamedayr and other online media outlets mentioned how UF students stand with FSU “despite” their age-old rivalry. We want to make this clear: Bringing up the rivalry or any past history between the two schools is immature and irrelevant. While orange and blue 
run deep in our veins, we must rise above pettiness for the sake 
of solidarity.
FSU is called home by many of our siblings, our signiﬁ  cant 
others and our friends. Even if you know no one attending FSU, they are Floridians. They are peers before they are rivals. Any and all support for them should be unconditional.
We’re comfortable to say we speak for The Gator Nation 
when we say we wholeheartedly send our thoughts, prayers and support to The Nole Nation. To FSU students: Warriors by 
name, you are all brave, and we applaud you for responding to 
hardship with grace, sensitivity and unity. We know you are all strong enough to stand alone in the healing process, but know that we stand with you.
We will grant one laurel this week: A #FSUnited LAUREL  
goes to the FSU community.

There’s plenty to hate 
about what has happened to modern television: 
cable companies, reality shows and really bad attempts at geek 
talk. TLC has become a joke of a 
“learning channel,” the History Channel shows anything but history and now Discovery has stepped up.
“Here Comes Honey Boo 
Boo” and “Ancient Aliens” might end up looking like art once Discovery airs a special ep-
isode of “Eaten Alive.” Discov-
ery claims the show will feature Paul Rosolie being swallowed alive by an anaconda while wearing a snake-proof suit.
The description might sound 
interesting at ﬁ  rst glance, but it doesn’t take much thought to realize how asinine the entire 
premise is.
As news of the episode has 
spread around the Internet, 
many have found themselves upset with Discovery’s decision to create such an episode.
A petition to keep the epi-
sode from airing has obtained over 30,000 supporters on 
change.org. One prominent 
supporter, University of Ala-bama professor Stephen Secor, has reached out to both the website and to other news out-lets with his experience.
Discovery was not ignorant 
of the danger or the potential backlash this stunt could bring. 
According to Secor, Discovery 
had reached out to him to be an adviser for the show due to his studies on the digestive tract in snakes and his previous experi-ence as a consultant for the ﬁ  lm “Anaconda.”
“I was extremely disap-
pointed that when given an 
opportunity to produce a show 
that would highlight the amaz-ing biology of this animal, that Discovery went with a produc-tion that is only based on fear and sensationalism,” Secor said. He ended up turning the job down.
Not only is the stunt dan-
gerous for both the man and the animal, but it also fails to provide any educational value for viewers who may actually be interested in learning about anacondas.
Years ago, Discovery gave 
us Steve Irwin, who would wrestle with crocodiles for the 
sake of education. Now we 
are given stunts for the sake of stunts.
Although Discovery claims 
the episode will promote con-servation, it seems as though the act is more likely to promote fear and misunderstanding of the creature instead.
Anacondas are not known for attacking or eating people, although some media has pro-moted perceptions to the con-trary.
Instead of educating the 
public on the aspects and abili-ties of the anaconda, it seems 
that Discovery is appealing to 
and encouraging the fears and misconceptions around the creature.
Discovery, along with other 
formerly educational chan-nels, have lost their purpose of informing viewers. Entertain-ment and ratings have taken 
priority, leading to a rise in ab-
surd and inane content such as fake documentaries.
Fake documentaries like 
“Russian Yeti: The Killer Lives” and “Mermaids: The Body Found” — though potentially entertaining — have absolutely no educational value. Some 
have actually misled people.
According to a poll, 70 per-
cent of Discovery’s viewers are unaware that the Megalodon is 
extinct after viewing fake foot-age that suggests otherwise.
Perhaps it is because Dis-
covery is desperate for views that it resorts to misinformation and spectacles.
Whatever the case, perhaps 
the current backlash Discov-
ery is receiving for its “Eaten 
Alive” episode will bring about some kind of awareness to its executives.
Spreading ignorance under 
the guise of science ﬁ  ction might be looked past, but it seems that Discovery has reached the public tolerance limit. Hurting 
an animal for ratings has back-
ﬁ  red, and rightfully so.
Even if the anaconda never 
actually attempts to swallow Rosolie in the episode, which will likely be the case, Discov-ery’s insinuations and advertis-ing are at least further evidence of their poor decision-making 
skills. Provoking the wrath of 
upset animal lovers is not what 
an educational channel ought to 
be doing — intentional or not.
Perhaps a good boycott and 
petition will remind the channel 
of what it used to be and what it was once capable of. Compared to its glory days, it seems unreal that it has stooped so low.
Please, Discovery, stop the 
stupid decisions. Learn from 
these mistakes and go back to 
your roots.

UWireForget math, science and history 
— students and parents are more concerned about sex in the class-
room.
This past week, Las Vegas students 
protested for a medically accurate sex-ual education curriculum. This spring, 
California parents petitioned to remove 
an “inappropriate” sex ed book from classrooms.
These speciﬁ  c issues with sex ed might be new, 
but the question of how to talk and teach about sex-
uality isn’t.
The topic of sex ed was actually one of the ﬁ  rst 
in my sexuality studies course this semester. We 
discussed where and how each of us learned about 
sex.
Some students mentioned ﬁ  fth grade health vid-
eos. Some lucky kids said they had productive con-
versations with parents. A few credited porn. One said that he learned about sex by playing The Sims.
The sources varied, and — presumably — so did 
the quantity and quality of information. To put it in perspective, only 22 states require sex education, according to Guttmacher.
Here’s a sobering thought: Florida isn’t one of 
them.
This lack of education sets us up for failure in 
terms of sexuality. I had very little sex ed, but what I did have was too late and not enough.
My most in-depth sex ed lesson was in ninth 
grade, and by that time — thanks to the Internet and my ﬁ  lthy mind — I was already well-versed in the how’s, what’s and why’s of the bump-and-grind.
I think I turned out pretty OK in terms of sexual 
knowledge, but the Internet is full of weird things. If that’s the only form of sex education that you get, then you’re not getting a comprehensive lesson.
The sexual education that you get from lunch-
room gossip or furtive Googling probably won’t include the information that you need to have a healthy sex life.
Your curiosity might lead you to learn what it 
means to “Eiffel tower” someone — thanks, Urban Dictionary — but it’s less likely that you’ll learn what STI symptoms to look out for, or what consent means.
Reﬁ  nery29 ran a recent article about how we talk 
about sex, and they nailed it by saying: “Sex ed ex-ists, sure — but it needs to address current conver-sations (and practices) involving sex if it is going to make an impact.” It’s not enough just to say that a man and a 
woman have sex and nine months later, 
there’s a baby.
Today’s sex ed needs to teach kids 
that there might not always be a man 
or a woman. The goal isn’t always to 
make a baby.
We need to talk about issues that 
aren’t already commonly discussed, including sex-ting, safe sex for gay couples, gender identity and 
sexually transmitted diseases.
We need real-life scenarios and real-life answers, 
not just diagrams and anatomical lessons.
Sometimes it’s really awkward to verbalize our 
thoughts about sex, especially across generations — 
that is, between adults and youth.
But there are so many ways to exchange infor-
mation that we can’t use communication barriers as excuses.
Share an article on Facebook. Buy a book about 
sexuality and earmark some important pages. Lis-ten to a podcast together.
As young adults, it’s easy for us to brush this off: 
“I’m past the point of sex ed and I don’t have kids yet. Not my problem.”
But the real problem here is how we think about 
sex as a whole. We don’t talk about it. We brush it under the rug. We stigmatize those who engage in 
sexual behaviors. This is a problem that anybody — 
yes, even you — can work on.
Our culture is one that is unwilling to have 
healthy and productive conversations about sex, 
and that’s bleeding over into our school curricu-
lums.
If we were more open about sex in general, it 
would be less of a taboo to discuss it in a school setting.
So remember this now, and remember it in ﬁ  ve, 
10, 15 years if you have kids. Talking about sex isn’t bad. Having sex isn’t bad. But preventing kids from having comprehensive and accurate sex education 
is bad.
That’s where conversations about sex come in. 
If we start to normalize sex in everyday life, sex in 
schools will become more normal too — and that’s one smart lesson to teach.

The small desk on the Plaza of 
the Americas was stacked with 
canned vegetables, boxes of crackers 
and drinks that will go toward feed-
ing graduate assistants and their families.
The food drive, hosted by Gradu-
ate Assistants United, an organiza-tion representing UF’s 4,000 gradu-ate, teaching and research assistants, collected food donations and house-hold supplies Wednesday and 
Thursday for students in need.
UF graduate assistant Sebastian 
Sclofsky, a 37-year-old Uruguay na-
tive who has been in the U.S. for four 
years with his wife and two children, 
said it was the ﬁ  rst year since he has arrived at UF that the organization has found the need to host a food drive for graduate assistants.
“A lot of our fellow co-workers are under a lot of ﬁ  nancial stress, and we wanted to reduce that, but at the same time we want to raise aware-
ness about the working conditions 
in which we are now,” he said.
Sclofsky said most graduate as-
sistants at the university make be-
tween $13,000 and $14,000 a year.
Graduate assistants received 
paychecks Nov. 14, the same day 
university employee fees were due.
UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes 
wrote in an email that most of the graduate assistants at UF work part time due to their primary status as students.
“Raising the pay for graduate as-
sistants remains a university prior-ity,” she said. “Graduate assistants received total compensation pack-age increases of more than 4 percent 
this year, and 5 percent last year.”
The response to the donation 
drive was immense, Sclofsky said.
Graduate Assistants United plans 
on handing out the donations at its 
ofﬁ  ce Monday in Yon Hall, Room 224, at the Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium.8, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 21, 2014

The UF Greek community an-
nounced new additions to its family 
Wednesday.
After weeks of presentations, one 
of three petitioning sororities was se-lected for the UF Multicultural Greek council, and two of three sororities pe-titioning the UF Panhellenic Council were chosen.
The two Panhellenic sororities se-
lected were Gamma Phi Beta and Al-
pha Phi. Gamma Phi Beta will be on 
campus Fall 2015 and Alpha Phi in Fall 2017.
“We women are thrilled to make 
our council stronger over the years to 
come, and I am honored to have began this process with my executive board 
this year,” wrote UF Panhellenic presi-dent Kelsey Torgerson in an email.
Torgerson said the expansion pro-
cess for the Multicultural Greek and Panhellenic councils will be beneﬁ  cial to the Greek community.
“The support from the current 16 
Panhellenic chapters will be nothing but positive when Gamma Phi Beta and Alpha Phi come to our campus,” she said.
Sigma Sigma Rho Sorority Inc., an 
Asian interest group from the Multi-cultural Greek Council, will start in Spring of 2015.

About 40 people gathered Thursday night 
to memorialize the lives of 226 transgender in-
dividuals lost to hate crimes in the past year, including a 4-year-old.
People presented poetry, songs and stories 
about their own experiences during the local observation of International Transgender Day of Remembrance. 
At the United Church of Gainesville event, 
residents expressed the need for change.
“We are gathered here together to create the 
honor and to celebrate our fallen trans sisters and brothers,” said speaker Joani McBride, “and I hope to commit to change the dynamic 
that underlies this horrid, horrid violence.”
At the door, residents received a slip of pa-
per with the the name and age of an individual 
who died, later reading them aloud.
Some people hesitated before reading the 
ages. From the back of the room someone mut-tered, “Jesus, just 14.”
The youngest victim was a 4-year-old who 
McBride said was murdered by her mother 
and her mother’s boyfriend after the child self-
identiﬁ  ed as a different gender.“It’s a sad event because we’re remember-
ing and honoring the people who had died at the hands of transphobia,” said associate min-ister Vince Amlin. “It’s a somber event, but it’s powerful and it needs to be heard.”
Three speakers shared their own stories of 
transformation including Kane Barr, who read two of his poems. He said he used poetry to cope with being transgender and feeling like he didn’t have an outlet or voice.
In one poem, he talked about telling his 
mom he was no longer the female twin daugh-
ter, but he was a male twin daughter. Another 
poem dealt with his feelings about himself and his physical appearance.
The Pride Community Center of North 
Central Florida sponsored the event, and both the UF Pride Student Union and the Alachua County Library District hosted events observ-ing the remembrance day.Transgender lives remembered

Safety 
TipsSafety 
TipsBoth personal and property safety is important as you search for oﬀ  -campus hous-
ing.  Before signing a lease, Oﬀ   Campus Life recommends you check the crime stats of an area before moving there.  A free service called Crime Reports is avail-
able on the Gainesville Police Department’s website.  Crime Reports allows you to see all 
reported crime in a certain area.  Go to www.gainesvillepd.org, click “Crime Reports” on 
the right-hand side, and enter the address of interest to see local incident data.
Below are ﬁ  ve tips to use when looking at safety during your apartment search:
1Go back to the 
complex at night.  
How do you feel?  Is the place well-lit and populated or dark and isolated?2 Does the prop-erty have work-
ing security gates and/or guards? 3Check for dead bolts on the out-
side door, locks for individual doors, alarm systems, etc. and ask lots of questions about the security.  Is there an extra charge for a security system? 4Has there been crime in the area 
recently?  What ac-tions have been done to prevent crime from happen-ing? 5Don’t forget about purchasing 
some Renter’s Insur-ance to protect you and your stuﬀ   from the unexpected.

Make sure you read and fully understand all aspects of the lease before signing.  A lease is a contract 
between you and your landlord that spells out speciﬁ  c details of your living arrangement.  Leases often involve policies about pets, security and pet deposits, legal entry and other important information.  Typi-
cally, leases in Gainesville are for 12 months. If you will need your place for 10 months or less, talk with the man-agement about whether they can provide you a short-term lease.  There are two types of leases that are usually available, Joint Leases and Individual Leases. LeasesLeases
Joint Leases
Individual Leases
Clauses to LOOK FOR in a lease:
Dates of occupancy
Amount of monthly rent and the date it is due each monthAmount of Application Fees, Security De-posit, Redecoration Fees and any other fees chargedResponsibility for payment of utilitiesResponsibility for general maintenance and repairsSublease: If you sign a 12 month lease, but think you may need the dwelling for a shorter period of time, make sure the lease allows you to sublease (rent your dwelling to another person who will assume the remainder of your lease)Pet policyAutomatic renewal clauseType of lease: Joint vs. IndividualClauses to AVOID in a lease:
At management’s discretion, the tenant 
may be asked to leave within three days
Tenant waives all defects in the building
Landlord shall not be responsible for in-
jury to person, including tenant and guests, as a result of any causeTenant is responsible for all repairs to 
premises Landlord may enter dwelling without no-
ticeLandlord has a lien (a legal claim on the 
property of another as security for the pay-ment of a debt) on all personal property of tenant
A great University of Florida resource available to full-time 
students is Student Legal Services.  For any questions on your 
lease, visit the Student Legal Services website www.studentle-
galservices.uﬂ  .edu and set up an appointment with a lawyer to 
help review it BEFORE you sign it. All roommates are held responsible for the lease.  If one person breaks the lease, the other roommates 
are held responsible for paying the total rent.  This tends to be the lease more prominent when renting a house or single family dwelling.
Each person is held responsible for his or her own actions.  For instance, if one roommate breaks the 
lease, that person is still responsible for paying their own rent.  For most college students, individual leases are the best choice.  Each person in the lease is responsible for his or her own actions and not the actions of a roommate.

Information reprinted with permission of UF’s Off Campus LifeIf you are thinking about renting a house 
or apartment, Renter’s Insurance pro-
vides important coverage for both you 
and your possessions. A standard Renter’s 
Policy protects your personal property in 
case of theft or damage and may pay for temporary living expenses if your rental is damaged (including loss of use). It can also 
shield you from personal liability. Anyone who leases a house or apartment should consider this type of coverage. Renter’s Insurance

Getting EvictedGetting Evicted
Can I Be Evicted For Any Other Reason?
Yes! Your lease can be terminated if you violate any lease terms, rules 
and regulations, or the Act. If your lease is terminated and you do not 
vacate the apartment, the landlord may ﬁ  le for your eviction immedi-
ately.
Termination begins with a 7-day notice.  Your options depend on 
whether the violations are classiﬁ  ed as “curable” or “noncurable”.
If you receive either type of notice, you should contact an attorney. 
Neither termination of your lease, nor your eviction from the apartment 
ends your liability for rent!
Curable Violations:  
You will be given seven days to 
correct a curable violation. Curable 
violations include unauthorized 
pets, guests, parking, or the failure 
to keep the apartment clean and 
sanitary. If you repeat the violation 
within 12 months, you will not be 
given another chance.Noncurable Violations : 
The landlord may terminate your 
lease with a 7-day notice without 
giving you a chance to correct a 
noncurable violation. Noncurable 
violations include deliberate de-
struction or misuse of the landlord’s 
property or a continued, unreason-
able disturbance. What Exactly Is An Eviction?
An eviction is the formal end to your right to oc-
cupy the apartment. It does not end your duty to 
pay rent. 
An eviction starts with a Summons. You must ﬁ  le 
an Answer within 5 days. Contact an attorney im-
mediately.
If the court rules against you, a judgment for pos-
session of the apartment, unpaid rent, late fees, 
interest, court costs and attorney’s fees will be en-
tered for the landlord. The sheriﬀ   will post a notice 
at the apartment that requires you to vacate within 24 hours. If you do not vacate within 24 hours, the 
sheriﬀ   will remove you and your personal property 
from the apartment.

Neither surrender of the apartment or 
eviction ends your liability for rent! You 
should contact an attorney immediately 
upon receipt of a three-day notice.What Can Happen 
If I Don’t Pay Rent?
Can I use My Security Deposit 
for the Last Month’s Rent?
No. Landlords can legally evict you for non-payment of rent 
even when your “security deposit” is equal to your last month’s 
rent. The purpose of the security deposit is to protect the land-
lord against damages to the apartment.FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 21, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 9

Early Thursday morning, a gunman 
shot and wounded three students at Stro-
zier Library on Florida State’s campus in 
Tallahassee.
While we here at alligatorSports write 
about UF sports and athletics in general, we 
want to make a note about setting aside the 
Florida-Florida State rivalry and support-
ing our sister school after such a tragedy.
Florida State athletic director Stan Wil-
cox released a statement on FSU’s athlet-ics website Thursday, stating athletics will 
continue as scheduled.
“Following tragic times like we expe-
rienced today, athletic events can help in 
unifying both the student body and com-
munity,” Wilcox said in the statement. 
“That is our hope in moving forward with these events.”
And that couldn’t be a more accurate 
statement. For many, sports are used as an 
outlet to get away from their daily lives. 
It serves as a sanctuary, a safe haven that they always know is there.
For Florida State, whether it’s watching 
the football team take on Boston College on Saturday, seeing its women’s soccer team take on Northeastern in the second round of the NCAA Tournament or watching any other sporting event it offers on campus, 
athletics are one constant that can’t (and 
shouldn’t) be shaken.Sports pro-
vide an end goal, 
something to look 
forward to amidst the horrible events that occurred Thursday morn-
ing.With the 
Thanksgiving hol-iday coming up, 
it should serve as a time of unity among all Florida schools.
Current and former UF players are showing their sup-port for the school that’s just two hours to 
the north.
Former Florida safety Ahmad Black      (@
ahmadblack35) tweeted “Can’t even imag-
ine what the families were going through waiting to see if their kids was safe.. cher-
ish every blessing #PrayForFSU” at 3:59 
a.m.
Freshman swimmer Caeleb Dressel 
(@caelebdressel), whose sister is on the 
FSU swimming and diving team, posted 
“Prayers for FSU and the students involved, this could happen anywhere #PrayForFSU” at 7:27 a.m.
Former Florida quarterback Tim Tebow 
(@TimTebow) tweeted “My thoughts and prayers are with the victims and families of the FSU shooting.” At 9:51 a.m.
Senior volleyball libero Holly Pole tweet-
ed “As big of a rivalry it is, certain things are just way more important. Thoughts and prayers for FSU” on her account (@hpoleswag) at 1:33 p.m.
As the Florida-Florida State football 
game approaches on Nov. 29, remember it is just that — a game.
Once the clock hits zero at Doak Camp-
bell Stadium next Saturday, everyone’s 
lives will return back to normal.
The in-state rivalry that comes and goes 
once a year in each sport should not be 
more important than the safety of our peers because of a silly college rivalry.Rivalries should be put on hold in wake of FSU shooting� THE JUNIOR SETTER IS 18TH IN THE COUNTRY IN 
ASSISTS PER SET.
EDEN OTERO
Alligator Staff Writer @edenotero_l
In Mackenzie Dagostino’s three years playing college vol-
leyball she hadn’t experienced a winning season in which she 
was the starting setter.
But in her ﬁ  rst year starting consistently for Florida, she’s hit 
her stride with one of the strongest teams in the country.
After spending her ﬁ  rst year of college volleyball at Mary-
land where she played a 6-2 offensive scheme and split time 
with then-senior setter Remy McBain, Dagostino transferred to 
Florida so she could be closer to her hometown, Tampa, and play for a team that shared the same goals as her.
As Dagostino sat the bench in her sophomore year — a year 
Florida completed the season 28-4 — she waited patiently for 
her number to be called to lead Florida through a winning sea-
son. 
Florida (21-3, 15-0 Southeastern Conference) has seen its fair 
share of success in conference play, but the difference-maker 
has been Dagostino’s quick and offensive approach on the 
court.
“We’ve always said it’s the second year of the transfer that 
they really have that opportunity to make a difference because the ﬁ  rst year you’re just getting used to all the changes and new 
terminology...” Wise said on Sept. 24. “She’s making plays from 
the setter position that we’ve had very few setters -- and we’ve had some very good ones come through here -- that have ever made because of how quick she is. She’s an elite level athlete.”
Dagostino’s pace — which Wise said exempliﬁ  es the set-
ters elite level of athleticism — has given her 934 assists and 61 kills.
But what Dagostino does best is scouting and exploiting open spots to help offensive players like Carli Snyder, Alex Holsten and Rhamat Alhassan make kills.
However, even with a successful season so far, Dagostino 
isn’t about to let down her guard.
“It’s not done yet, there’s still three games,” Dagostino said. 
“Regardless of if a share (of the SEC) is clinched or not, we have to ﬁ  nish the season. It’s amazing to be able to clinch half of it, but it’s not done until we play that last match at home against South Carolina.”
Her consistency on offense has made her the 18th best setter in the country with 11.25 assists per set and ninth in the country in service aces per set (.49)
But even with a starting position and a winning season, Da-
gostino said it’s no different from her previous two years.
“It’s no different than volleyball has ever been for me,” Da-
gostino said. “It’s just a challenge always, as it’s supposed to be. It’s been fun, this is a fun team to work with. It’s a very hard working group, so everything that we’ve accomplished is something that we’ve expected to accomplish and we’re hoping to just keep doing the same thing through the tournament.”Dagostino elevates 
UF offense with quick 
pace, athleticism

twitter: @J_McPherson1126� BUNDUKI “DUKE” RAMADAN IS ALSO A RAPPER.
RICHARD JOHNSON 
Alligator Staff Writer @RagjUF
Bunduki Ramadan can do it all. He is the mic man you 
see on the sidelines during football games at Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n 
Stadium, leading chants and cheers — a position he audi-
tioned for after hearing about it through his ﬁ  rst friend at the 
University of Florida. 
He’s the new Mr. Orange and Blue, after having the torch 
passed to him by Richard Johnston Jr., the man who has 
been asking Florida fans to “Give me a G!” for three decades 
before kickoff. 
Those things are fun, and the former Preview staffer is far 
from shy in front of an audience, but the conﬁ  dence comes from his ﬁ  rst love, rap music.
Duke, as most people call him can and will rap about any-
thing, anywhere, like when he sat down with The Alligator and pulled a verse about his day off the top of his head, the 
only beat to this freestyle track consisting of snaps provided 
by UF cheer coach Cortnee Alexander. 
“So today I woke up came here to practice and I was like, 
interview I gotta have this / I saw you here and we got to sittin down, and you will understand why I am around / I had to drop in and tell you ‘bout my life, so we gonna do it and I’ma do it right / we could sit here and I can tell you all 
night, or we could stop it here and you know I just might / 
And you can write everything about my story and you can write about how I might have some glory, in the future, and do it, and then I can rap about more music.” 
To understand him, all you need to do is listen to the 
rhythms and sounds around him, the things that move him. 
It’s the beat that motivates him to do what he loves, 
whether it’s the deafening noise of nearly 30,000 students on Saturdays, the slow tune behind his single Old School 
Pt. 2 or the ﬂ  ute-like melody that plays behind his single 
“specialty.” 
He works at his talent, describing a practice-makes-per-
fect mentality that a basketball player has when working on 
his or her three-point stroke, coincidentally steps away from where Michael Frazier II and Eli Carter show showcase their 
crafted strokes inside the Stephen C. O’Connell Center. 
“What I used to do is I used to read the dictionary to learn 
new words and ﬁ  gure out more words that rhyme with each 
other,” Duke said. “My mind’s just contained with a library of words and phrases that go and rhyme with each other 
so I’m able to rap about whatever anything that anybody throws at me.”
He is motivated by struggle and family. His father and 
mother were a policeman and an agriculturist respectively back in what was then only referred to as Sudan before civil 
war tore the country apart and his parents moved the fam-ily to Egypt as war refugees. Duke was eventually born in Cairo, but it wasn’t a typical birth. 
“My shoulders were really wide. I couldn’t come out, and 
there was no time for a C-section because I was losing oxy-gen and pretty much the doctor saw that and he was like ‘Either I pull this kid out or he dies,’” Duke said. “So like the doctor pulled me out and it kinda deformed my wrist a little 
bit, but hey, I’m alive.” 
His right wrist functions, but he’s unable to rotate it backward. His right hand is permanently facing palm up. 
He never got a diagnosis for his arm but said he still can do everything he wants with it. 
Duke still has family in the southern portion of Sudan, 
ofﬁ  cially recognized as the Republic of South Sudan in 2011, and Africa is prominent around his music. He has multiple pictures and videos on his website wearing a necklace with 
the continent’s outline and references to South Sudan’s capi-
tal are heard in Old School Pt. 2: “they gon’ feel me from Du-val to Compton, Juba, South Sudan, I do this for all them.”
“My parents always talked about living back at home 
and they always taught me not to take stuff for granted that I 
have here and sometimes like just like running water they’d 10, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 21, 2014

One student is still keeping the 
student section hyped even when 
the Gator football team can’t. 
Meet Duke the mic man: hip-hop 
artist, optimist, brave leader of the 
student section.
Bunduki Ramadan, who goes by 
Duke, is UF’s ﬁ  rst ofﬁ  cial mic man. 
He shared the responsibility of ener-gizing the crowd this football season with Mr. Orange and Blue.
At the beginning of November, 
Richard Johnston Jr., who has been Mr. Orange and Blue for 31 seasons, 
announced his retirement. 
He’s ofﬁ  cially passing the mic to 
Ramadan.
Ramadan, a 22-year-old UF eco-
nomics senior with a minor in Ara-
bic studies, helped honor Johnston during the ﬁ  rst quarter of Florida’s game against South Carolina last Saturday. Johnston was honored 
for his service to The Gator Nation 
and presented with a trophy – one orange shoe and one blue one en-closed in a glass case.
“Most people don’t know who 
I am unless I’m wearing my one orange one blue shoe,” Johnston said. “They see the feet, they look at my face, they say, ‘Oh, you’re that 
guy.’”
The 57-year-old brokerage law-
yer in Fort Myers drove four hours 
both ways to every home game. Johnston started at UF in the Fall of 1975. He walked on the swim team and then switched to cheerleading in 1978. In 1984 he got a call from the UF Athletic Association asking if he would come back and lead the pre-game pump-up cheers. He’s been there ever since, working as the liai-son between the band, cheerleaders and crowd.
“It’s a rush that I can’t explain,” 
Johnston said.
Johnston was just another face on 
the Spirit Squad until he was high-lighted in a video played at Gator Growl a few years ago. Mr. Orange and Blue was born.
His wife, Tracie Carlson, at-
tended Florida State University and is supportive of her husband as Mr. Orange and Blue.
“He’s little-kid happy,” Carlson 
said. “He’s crazy silly about it.”
Johnston said he saw Ramadan 
connect with the student section at the Eastern Michigan game just like he used to and decided it was time to give his job back to a student.
“I went over, and I listened to 
him, and I was like ‘Wow, he gets it,’” Johnston said. “He just knows how to communicate with the crowd.”
Ramadan became the mic man 
after an audition at the beginning of the semester. He practices a few times a week with the cheer squad and doesn’t get paid for the posi-tion. UF cheer coach Cortnee Alex-ander said the program added the job of mic man to connect students with the band and cheerleaders.
“Within the ﬁ  rst ten minutes of 
sitting down with Duke I knew right off the bat he was the one,” Alexan-der said.
Patrick Glynn, a 20-year-old 
public relations senior, met Duke at one of his hip-hop performances last spring. Glynn said Ramadan’s talent with freestyle rapping and 
entertaining make him a natural on 
the mic. 
“Everyone’s kind of happy when 
they’re listening to him,” Glynn said.
He also said the crowd at the 
game Saturday loved how Rama-dan freestyle-rapped a witty line 
about the South Carolina Game-
cocks’ team mascot.
“He even had the other team 
laughing,” he said.
Ted Fitzgeorge, 57-year-old Gator 
fan and friend of Johnston, said Johnston had an enviable amount of passion as Mr. Orange and Blue.
“He’s got some big orange and 
blue Crocs to ﬁ  ll,” Fitzgeorge said of Ramadan.
Ramadan sports his own signa-
ture style with an orange-and-blue-striped bow tie, white button-down shirt and blue pants with Gator em-blems.
But will Ramadan stay on the 
mic for 31 years?
“We’ll see,” he said with a laugh.FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 21, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 11

Carolina on Saturday at Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium.
FOOTBALLUF mic man energizes crowd during football season
He aspires to travel the world after graduating in December 2015
have to go somewhere else,” Duke said. 
“You’d have to walk a mile just to get some water and bring it back all the way home, 
and you wouldn’t have hot water to bathe 
in, you’d have to heat it up yourself or go ahead and take that cold shower.”When Duke was young, his family moved 
to Jacksonville because his parents wanted a better educational experience for him and his four siblings. As he grew up, he began a love of poetry that turned into a love of rap. 
His musical inﬂ  uences include Wale, Ludac-
ris and Lupe Fiasco because they rap about things that aren’t mainstream like money, cars and clothes, something he tries to do in his own music. 
He’s an economics major, and he minors 
in Arabic. After he graduates in December 2015, he hopes to travel the world. 
For now, he’s a valued member of UF’s 
cheer team and a promising musician.
There was a disconnect between students, 
athletics and the spirit squads, and the mic man position was created to ﬁ  ll that void, something Duke’s energy made him perfect 
for in part because of “his enthusiasm for life 
in general,” as Alexander puts it. 
The enthusiasm comes from Duke doing 
what he loves with passion and intelligence, 
like this line from Old School Pt. 2.
“This is for everyone that’s wishin they 
could be in my position / all it takes is some 
ambition and a little bit of wisdom.”DUKE , from page 10BUY IT. SELL IT. FIND IT. 373-FIND

Chris Walker attempts a layup during Florida’s 72-49 win against Missouri on March 14 in the Georgia Dome in Atlanta.
ERICA A. HERNANDEZ
Alligator Staff Writer @EricaAlyssa
Billy Donovan has experience 
managing expectations, but the 
return of suspended sophomore forward Chris Walker tonight against Louisiana-Monroe will be another test of Donovan’s man-agement skills this season.
When the No. 8 Gators (1-1) 
host the Warhawks (2-0) for the first time in program history at 8 p.m., these expectations will come to fruition.
Walker is not unfamiliar 
with highly anticipated debuts. Though Florida fans had to wait significantly longer for Walker’s collegiate debut, it seems to be a trend for Walker to make a late but impactful start with the Gators.
Florida fans had to wait only 
three games this season, as com-pared to 23 games last season. In his freshman year, the 2013 Mc-Donald’s All-American sat out the entire fall semester and all of January for academic eligibility issues. His three-game suspen-sion this year was brought after he broke team rules.
Donovan said he believes 
Walker has done a better job of managing others’ expectations.
“I really think that sometimes 
when there’s expectations on a player, a player can get really weighed on those expectations or a player can say, ‘There’s no way I can reach that expectation 
of what’s expected of me.’ I think 
for Chris, maybe early in the 
year he was wrapped up in those 
things,” Donovan said. “Now, I’ve seen a growth in him where 
he’s gotten back down to (the) 
reality of, ‘I need to get better. I 
need to improve. I need to figure 
out a way to help our team.’ My thing for him tomorrow is just to 
go out there and to have both feet 
in a circle and to do the things we 
need him to do, to help us be a 
better team.”
In 2014, Walker played 18 
games, including postseason play, after his midseason debut against Missouri on Feb. 4. Last season, he averaged 1.9 points and 1.3 rebounds. Walker’s post-season performance was a large part in building up expectations for this season. The then-fresh-man achieved a career-best seven points during just six minutes of play in Florida’s 79-68 win over UCLA in the NCAA Sweet 16.
Though Walker isn’t projected 
to start, Donovan said that could change depending on Thursday afternoon’s practice.
“He’s gotten away from this 
idea that he needs to be this scor-er,” Donovan said. “I think he’s 
playing closer to his strengths 
and I think we as a coaching staff 
have tried to help him see that.” 
Walk-on senior forward Ja-
cob Kurtz, who is still listed as 
a starter for tonight’s game, said 
he’s seen Walker improve during 
this three-game suspension.
“I mean he’s been practicing 
hard, he’s been in here every 
day, he’s been at the games, just 
watching film. So he’s been try-
ing to learn and understand what 
he has to do so he can come in to-morrow and help us out,” Kurtz 
said. “He can’t go out and try to 
do too much, I know all this hype, 
obviously he’s gonna be very ex-
cited to play but he has to stay to what his job is.”
One player who won’t play 
against Louisiana-Monroe is 
junior forward Dorian Finney-
Smith. Donovan said Finney-Smith, who fracture two bones 
his left hand against William & 
Mary, will not play tonight. Al-
though Finney-Smith has been 
medically cleared to play, he is 
still dealing with swelling and 
pain, Donovan said.
“So I’m not focused on put-
ting him out there where he’s 
just trying to protect himself be-
cause he’s really uncomfortable,” 
Donovan said. “How much lon-
ger this will go on, I’m not sure, but definitely going to be out for (tonight’s) game.”Chris Walker returning from suspension, will not start tonight

Facing its toughest test of the young sea-
son, the Florida women’s basketball team 
clawed back against a double-digit half-
time deficit but ultimately fell short against 
St. John’s (2-0) in Queens, New York, on Thursday night.
The Gators (2-1) fell to the Red Storm 
72-66, getting 16 points from redshirt ju-nior Carlie Needles, who turned in another strong shooting performance from down-town with four three-pointers.
“Carlie hit big shots,” coach Amanda 
Butler said. “Her teammates expect her to do that, her coaches expect her to do that and most importantly she expects to do that.”
Butler said Needles kept the team in the 
game in the second half with her shooting, giving UF a chance to overcome an early deficit.
The Gators found themselves down 40-
26 at halftime, a half in which Florida failed 
to capitalize on opportunities. 
Redshirt junior Cassie Peoples missed 
all four shots she took from the field, and 
the team was out-rebounded and missed all 
four of its free throws. The Gators mounted 
a comeback in the second half, outscoring the Red Storm and taking a 55-54 lead  with 6:07 remaining in the game on a fastbreak layup from junior January Miller. 
But Florida couldn’t complete the come-
back, with St. John’s outrunning the Gators the rest of the way to secure the win.
As was the case in the home opener 
against Jacksonville last Friday, the Gators failed to start with a considerable amount of pace. Coach Amanda Butler has repeat-edly reminded the team that the slow starts 
must be improved upon – slow starts will 
lose the team games when Southeastern Conference play begins.The fast pace applies to not only the of-
fense, but the defense as well. The Gators 
had spent significant time working on its 
man defense, but often found themselves unable to defend the Red Storm outside of the zone.
“We weren’t able to defend them in man, 
and we worked hard on defending in man, so that was disappointing,” Butler said.
Sophomore Ronni Williams, Florida’s 
leading scorer through its first two games, 
appeared to twist her ankle in the second 
half. It was the latest in a string of unrelated injury scares for Williams, a result of her tough and aggressive play.
“Ronni had a tough night, in a lot of 
ways,” Butler said. “We need her to be there on the floor.” Needles strives as Florida loses to St. John’s on the roadTipoff is at 8 in O’Dome
“Carlie hit big shots. Her 
teammates expect her to do that, 
her coaches expect her to do that 
and most importantly she expects 
to do that.”

The regular season is 
over. 
The ﬁ  rst round of the 
NCAA Tournament is over. 
Florida is still standing, 
with its next hurdle being 
the second round of the tour-
nament tonight.
The No. 2 seed Gators (15-
4-1, 9-2 Southeastern Confer-
ence) will host the California Golden Bears (14-5-2, 5-4-2 
PAC 12) tonight at 7 at Don-
ald R. Dizney Stadium. 
The Golden Bears ad-
vanced to the second round 
by defeating San Diego State 
3-2 in double overtime last weekend in Berkeley, Cali-fornia. 
Now, they have to make 
the trip across the country to face off with Florida, who defeated Mercer 3-0 in its ﬁ  rst round match.
The Gators move from one 
bear opponent to another. 
Florida is looking to build 
off of its balanced win over the Mercer Bears on Sunday 
and carry that momentum 
into tonight’s game against Cal.
“I think Cal is a very good 
team, I think it’s a really tough second round match,” coach Becky Burleigh said. “But I’m excited to play them too, excited to play a team 
that we haven’t played in a 
long time, and I think it’s just going to be a good opportu-nity for us to test ourselves 
and see where we are.”
Tonight’s game will be 
just the second meeting ever 
between Florida and Cal. 
The last meeting was also in Gainesville for NCAA Tournament play in 2008 when the Gators won 2-1.
The winner of tonight’s 
match will face the winner of Auburn and Texas Tech, who face off at Dizney Stadium today at 3 p.m., on Sunday.
But, as Florida has 
preached all week, it isn’t looking past its next game. 
The Gators are focused on 
Cal.
“I think right now we just 
need to stay present-minded and take one game at a time,” said senior Taylor Burke. 
“Since we’re so close, just 
keep our relationships well and just kind of go from there.”
A factor that may play 
into tonight’s game is the temperature. Florida practiced this 
week in the cold for the ﬁ  rst time all season and is hoping it warms up a bit by the time 
kickoff comes around. 
But with ﬁ  ve players on 
the roster from Ohio, and 
players from Colorado, 
North Carolina, Illinois and 
even Canada, not all of the Gators are used to Florida winters.
Burke, from Medina, 
Ohio, joked that this week’s weather was “beautiful Ohio weather.”
Senior Havana Solaun, of 
Gainesville, said she is up for playing in the cold and that it’s better than playing in the heat.
Despite what the elements 
may offer tonight, Florida needs to put on a solid per-formance all around if it wants to be playing again on Sunday. 
The Bears won 14 games 
this season and present a tough second round match-up for the Gators.
The Florida seniors es-
pecially want to extend this season for as long as pos-sible. They realize now that each game could be their last 
in a Gators uniform, so they 
are taking full advantage of their time left on the ﬁ  eld.
That will continue to-
night.
“For us, the ending of the 
season is more than just the actual team being done,” So-laun said. 
“I think that it’s crazy be-
cause this team will never be together again and I think that we’re all gonna lay it all 
on the ﬁ  eld and hold on for 
as long as we can.”
