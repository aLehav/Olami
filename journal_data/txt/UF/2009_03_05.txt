� THE VIGIL WAS HELD TO PROTEST 
THE PROPOSED CUT TO UF’S UNDERGRAD EDUCATION PROGRAM.

The fight against the potential cut of UF’s 
undergraduate education program got off 
to a dark, cold and slightly windy start last 
night outside of Norman Hall.
About 150 people huddled together, some 
holding battery-operated candles, to listen to 
local education leaders protest UF’s decision 
to consider cutting the two undergraduate 
majors in the College of Education.
“When I heard the news, I couldn’t be-
lieve it,” Leanetta McNeally, principal of Duval Elementary School and a UF alumna, 
said of UF’s proposal.
“I thought, ‘Ludicrous,’” McNeally said. 
“We cannot sit down and do nothing.”
Jim Brandenburg, principal of Alachua 
Elementary School, said cutting the under-
graduate programs would not only affect the students at UF but students all across Alach-ua County, because many local schools use interns from UF’s programs to help teach 
their children.
At one point during his speech, the 
blown-up pictures of children that flanked 
the lectern were toppled by the wind, at which point Brandenburg quipped, “I guess it’s symbolic the pictures of children are fall-
ing down because they’re particularly vul-
nerable to the changes being proposed.”
In between speakers, students from the 
College of Education performed a skit to 
poke fun at UF’s priorities during budget 
cuts.

dent who organized the event, also read an oversized letter from first and second grad-On c AMpUSVigil held for public education

Editor’s note: This is  the final 
part of a two-part series about veteran UPD officers.  The safety net
UPD is used to treating UF 
as a “small city,” one that keeps patrol officers busy with bizarre calls and amusing situations. Sgt. Walt Hamby has had a full-time job with UPD for almost 20 years, which has led to many stories in his patrol arsenal that are usually 
too “inappropriate” to share,  he said. 
A memory that 
stuck out in Hamby’s 
mind was when he was perform-ing a routine patrol early one morning and he found a student lying in the grass behind Graham and Trusler halls. The student, who had obviously been drink-ing, asked to be taken home.
When the student couldn’t recognize his residence, Hamby realized he had been visiting from Florida State University. 
“He thought he was in Talla-
hassee on FSU’s campus,” Ham-by chuckled.

For some people, four years at UF 
just isn’t enough.
Luckily for them, the Florida Legis-
lature is considering a bill that would 
allow UF and the other 10 state universi-
ties to house the ashes of alumni and uni-
versity supporters on 
their campuses.
The bill was passed 
unanimously by the Senate’s Banking and 
Insurance committee on Wednesday.
It still needs to pass through two 
more committees before the full Senate can vote on it.
An identical bill has been introduced 
in the House.
The bill would allow for the construc-
tion of a columbarium, which house cre-mated remains, on five acres or less of a university’s campus.
Current law requires new cemeteries 
to be at least 30 acres.
UF spokesman Steve Orlando said 
UF is in favor of the idea.
“There are a lot of people out there 
who have just an enormous attachment 
to this school, and this is a way of help-
ing honor that request,” Orlando said.
He said UF’s columbarium would UF may

Grand jury charges mom in son’s death
PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. (AP) — A grand jury has charged a Port 
St. Lucie woman with premeditated, first-degree murder for allegedly 
smothering her 8-year-old son to death Christmas Day.
Police say 31-year-old Eryn Allegra gave the boy eight Advil pills 
to put him to sleep Christmas Eve, then early Christmas morning suf-focated him with a pillow in a hotel room. Investigators say Allegra then tried to slit her wrists, but the blade she used was too dull. She dialed 911 and was taken to a local hospital.
Allegra said she had been having financial problems since 2007.If 
convicted, Allegra faces either life in prison or a death sentence.SEE vIgIL, p AgE   8SEE gRA vE, p AgE 8

Tebow visits Tallahassee
As if winning the BCS National 
Championship wasn’t enough, UF 
will accept a resolution from the state Legislature today honoring the football team for its success.
Coach Urban Meyer, quarter-
back Tim Tebow and linebacker Ryan Stamper will be on hand to receive the praise, along with uni-versity and athletic department leaders like UF President Bernie Machen and Athletics Director Jeremy Foley, according to a news release.
Gov. Charlie Crist will also host 
a breakfast for the group. UF’s football team accepted a similar resolution from lawmakers in 2007 for the 2006 championship. 
Tebow also visited the Legis-
lature in April and made a few remarks. He even obliged legisla-tors who wanted autographs and 
pictures and ended up tossing a 
football around with Marco Ru-bio, who was house speaker at the time, according to news reports.

CORRECTION
A headline in the Wednesday 
edition of the Alligator incorrectly reported that UF has spent over $100 million on federal lobbying. 
UF has never spent more than $1 
million in a given year.
A Wednesday article reported 
UF student senators passed a bill that gave $35,130.86 to UF’s Board of College Councils. The bill actu-ally approved using the money, which was allocated last spring, 
in a different way, via a special re-
quest line.advanced studio class all the in-volved students are taking, said he thought the trip was a great success.
“It was a real informative 
trip,” he said. “I think we learned a lot about the next generation office environment.”
The trick now is to shape those 
ideas to the Gainesville area.
“You can’t just mimic what 
you see somewhere else,” said Wes Hogan, another student. “It’s really about individual city culture.”
Ramsey thinks the intellectu-
al power coming from UF helps 
make Gainesville a great place 
for new ideas.
“Every community says, ‘we 
want to be high-tech,’” he said. “In this community we can.”

Student lies to police
A UF student was arrested 
Tuesday after he lied to police about being robbed.
At around 12:30 p.m. Michael 
Hughes, 20, called the Gainesville 
Police Department and told offi-
cers that he had been robbed by two men with knives, the GPD arrest report stated.
According to the report, be-
cause of the severity of Hughes’ call, GPD sent two officers, two detectives, a supervisor and an evidence technician to his apart-
ment at 1225 SW 1st Ave.
When they arrived, Hughes 
told officials that he had made 
the story up, GPD spokesman Mike Schibuola said.
He told officers he called be-
cause he wanted to heighten law enforcement patrol around his apartment complex. He said for 
the past three months “strange 
people” would come to his door asking for Xanax, the report stat-ed.
According to the report, 
Hughes told officers he missed an important meeting Tuesday morning, misplaced money his mother gave him and was under stress because of school.
During the investigation, offi-
cers found a large white pipe on the kitchen counter and a glass bong on top of the refrigerator. Hughes admitted to using them for smoking marijuana, the re-port stated. Hughes was charged with making a false police report 
and possessing and using drug 
paraphernalia.

Students visit Silicon Valley
Twelve graduate students from 
the UF School of Architecture trav-eled to California to learn how Google and Intel design and man-age their properties.
The trip was sponsored by the 
Gainesville Chamber of Com-merce, and now that the students are back, it’s their mission to apply what they saw to their own design plans in Gainesville.
David Ramsey, director of eco-
nomic development for Gaines-ville’s Council for Economic Out-reach, said the city wants to attract more high-tech companies and industries with creative building 
designs.
Ramsey said Gainesville is al-
ready a hot spot of such develop-
ment, but the city is too tight on space to provide interested firms with work areas. 
The sites the students visited 
are some of the most progressive and successful in the field.
“Google is like a creative ma-
chine,” Ramsey said. “Being around that, bringing some of those ideas back to the communi-ty… I can’t tell you how incredible that is, how resourceful that is for us and what we do here.”
Sihui Ma, a student on the trip, 
said she believes in the power of 
innovative office cultures. 
“I think the point of the whole 
trip was to study alternative cor-
porate cultures versus the one we think…the traditional kind with a cubicle.”

Sexy, passionate and murder-
ous are not words typically used 
to describe an orchestra concert.
But those are some of the words 
conductor Matthew Wardell used 
when talking about tonight’s 
UF Symphony Orchestra perfor-mance.
At the Phillips Center for the 
Performing Arts at 7:30 tonight, the UF School of Music will pres-ent three musical pieces  and a bal-let.
Winners of the 42nd Annual Concerto Competition will per-form, followed by a ballet by Béla Bartók, “The Miraculous Manda-rin.”  
Wardell said two out of 25 stu-
dents who auditioned won the School of Music’s  concerto com-petition.  Concertos rely on a back and forth “conversation” between 
soloist and orchestra.
Yefim Romanov, the under-
graduate winner, will perform 
Tchaikovsky’s “Concerto for Vio-lin and Orchestra.” Although the piece is difficult to perform, it is a passionate attention grabber, Romonov said.
Anastasiya Naplekova, the graduate student winner, follows 
with a performance of Rachmani-
noff’s “Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini.”
After intermission, the UF 
School of Music and the UF School of Theatre and Dance will perform a ballet with original choreogra-phy by Ric Rose, associate profes-sor of dance. 
Based on the ideal that all be-
ings deserve satisfaction, Bartók’s “Miraculous Mandarin” is a chill-ing story told through sex, greed and violence.
After its first showing in Co-
logne, Germany in 1926, the bal-let was banned and torn apart by censors because of its graphic con-tent. 
Although it has been performed 
since then, it wasn’t until 2000 that the score was restored to its origi-nally intended form, Wardell said.
Unlike many large-scale col-laborations, this concert will be performed strictly by students.
“A lot of times performances 
like this will include faculty mem-bers and hired professionals,” he said. “The orchestra, the conduc-tor, the soloists and the dancers are all products of the College of Fine Arts.” 
The performance will be a buf-
fet for both the ears and the mind, said cellist Evan Kassof, a music composition and physics double major.
“It’s an emotional experience,” 
Kassof said. “There’s nothing that we are playing tonight that some-one can’t relate to.”

� THE PACT ENCOURAGES 
ACCOUNTABILITY.
By CAROLYN TILLO 
Alligator Contributing Writer
UF’s Interfraternity Council met 
to sign its first anti-hazing pact at Beta Theta Pi Fraternity house on Wednesday night.
The pact encourages members 
of the council to hold each other accountable in their efforts to elim-inate hazing practices, and it calls for an emphasis on anti-hazing education within UF fraternity 
chapters.
Clay Mathews, president of 
the Interfraternity Council, read 
the pact before it was signed by the presidents of the 25 fraternity chapters that make up the council. 
He said hazing is not congruent 
with the value-based nature of the council and its members.
After the signing, Patricia 
Telles-Irvin, vice president for Stu-dent Affairs, mentioned her expe-riences as a sorority sister at Duke.
Telles-Irvin added that the pact 
is important because it holds coun-cil members accountable to each 
other in their actions to end haz-
ing.
She said although hazing is a 
tradition, UF faces a new genera-tion of students who are not afraid 
to speak up about hazing practices. 
Telles-Irvin also 
said that, during 
these times of economic difficulty and budget cuts, UF fraternities must maintain a positive reputa-tion if they want the parents of pledges to pay for their sons to join fraternities.She also said fraternities play 
an important role in maintaining UF’s reputation.
“This university is striving to 
be one of the top 10 public institu-tions, and you play a role in that,” she said. “You are very much a part of getting there.”
Stephen McClaughlin, the pres-
ident of Beta Theta Pi Fraternity, sees the pact as a way of augment-ing the Greek community.
“We’ve had some downfalls in 
the past,” he said. “We just need to grow from there.”
Matthew Panzano, the presi-dent of Delta Upsilon Fraternity 
and a member of the committee 
which helped create the pact, said because he is an only child, he joined a fraternity to experience a sense of brotherhood but was ini-tially deterred by fears of hazing.
He said he appreciates the unity 
that the pact represents.
“I’m just hoping to see some 
progress, that’s all,” he said.
Mathews said anti-hazing re-
sources for students and parents will be available on the Interfrater-nity Council’s Web site at greekga-tor.com.

Last night, about 30 of Krystina 
Gustafson’s friends packed her living room 
to watch Wheel of Fortune projected onto a 
white sheet tacked to the wall. She was about 
to relive her $17,700 win on the show. 
Though she wasn’t nervous for the bulk 
of the taping, she said she dreaded seeing 
herself on television. 
“I was more nervous about watching it 
than I was about filming it,” she said. Whenever she watched the show with 
boyfriend Greg Kastner, Gustafson figured out the puzzles before the contestants on 
TV. But Gustafson said the game was easier 
from the couch than on the set.
The show tryouts started in October, in a 
sweltering mall parking lot filled with a sea of other potential contestants in front of the 
yellow Wheelmobile Winnebago. 
When her name was drawn from hun-
dreds of other information sheets submit-
ted that morning, she had been waiting for 
two hours, with the sunburn to prove it. She 
clamored to the stage, introduced herself and fulfilled the announcer’s request that 
everyone on stage dance. 
Two weeks later, 
Gustafson was selected 
to move on to the second round, with a four-hour 
series of mock Wheel of 
Fortune games and written 
puzzle-solving tests. Three 
weeks after that, she was 
called and told she made the show.
In December, she finally got to compete 
on the show she had watched since she was a toddler. 
“I’m usually really competitive, so I fig-
ured I would be pretty cut throat,” she said. 
“Once I got there, though, I was just so ex-
cited to be on the show that I didn’t really care.”
After the taping, Gustafson kept quiet 
about her winnings. But last night, her 
friends gathered to watch Gustafson win a 
$1,000 gift card to Maui Jim Sunglasses, an eight-day trip to Cabo San Lucas, $11,000 cash, which she designated for rent after 
graduation, and, above all, the title Wheel of 
Fortune winner. STUDENT LIFE

It looks like a cigarette in every 
way, but, instead of paper, there is 
a hard casing.
Instead of fire are mechanical 
innards. And instead of smoke, the 
user breathes in nicotine-infused 
mist.
The new electronic cigarette, or 
“e-cig,” has been making its way into the Gainesville market, but lo-cal health officials, who agree with the Food and Drug Administration, are skeptical of the product’s claims. “I’ve had some people say they real-ly like them,” said Naoma Hunlock, a manager at the Kangaroo on North Main Street, which sells NJOY brand e-cigs.
Almost all of the starter kits have 
sold out, Hunlock said. For $70, the 
kit includes an atomizer, which cre-
ates the mist and is shaped like the butt of the cigarette; two batteries, shaped like the stem; a charger; and five nicotine cartridges, roughly equivalent to two and a half packs of cigarettes. Cartridges are sold in packs of 10, in flavors like apple and menthol, for $20.                                                                            
Adi Weiss, who works at the Smoke Anywhere kiosk in Oaks Mall, has several suggestions for the possible use of e-cigs.
Because the starter kit he sells in-
cludes four different levels of nico-tine, ranging from that of a normal cigarette to none, he suggested that it could be used to help smokers quit.
“You can smoke it where you 
cannot smoke normally,” he said. “It’s also a healthier way to smoke, because the carcinogens are gone.”
While these claims have not been 
tested extensively, Weiss believes that as the market grows, research will confirm his statements, he said.
But Maureen Miller, a tobacco 
prevention specialist at UF, believes that these claims could be mislead-ing to consumers.
“The fact that it mimics smoking 
will definitely not help with quit-ting,” she said. “I would not endorse 
this product.”
She is also concerned that until 
the FDA has time to research e-cigs, 
there could be unknown health risks associated with the product, she said.
New ‘e-cig’ may offer carcinogen-free way to smoke

A team of UF professors and alumni, spon-
sored by Quick-Med Technologies Inc., has created a new adhesive bandage that repels bacteria and promotes faster healing. 
The product, which received FDA approval 
last week, will be sold in stores come July and will aid  in the creation of anti-bacterial mili-tary clothing and more effective hand gels.
Known as the NIMBUS, the bandage is the 
first and only non-leeching, microbicidal bar-rier dressing.
“We were trying to make a better wound-
healing bandage that would absorb wound fluids and kill bacteria,” said Chris Batich, 
professor of materials science engineering and  
associate director of UF’s clinical and transla-tional science institute.
“Bacteria can’t grow in it, and noth-
ing comes out of the Band-Aid and into the wound,” said Batich, who invented the ban-dage with fellow UF professor Gregg Schultz 
and UF graduate William Toreki.
“Potentially, you can leave it on lon-
ger, and it should promote healing faster.”  
Most bandages absorb wound fluids into the 
bandage material, creating an area in which bacteria can easily grow.
Because white blood cells are unable to 
fight these new bacteria, the wound may be-come re-infected, and the bandage will start to 
smell.
The NIMBUS technology binds a large 
polymer to the surface of the gauze fibers 
said Gregg Schultz, professor of obstetrics and gynecology in UF’s institute for wound research.
Other dressings contain microbes such as 
silver, which may slow the healing process.
NIMBUS also gives the bandage fibers the 
ability to kill bacteria from the wound and bacteria that are resistant to other antibiotics, such as MRSA, a staph infection that cannot be cured by many common antibiotics, Schultz said.  
“This stuff kills those bacteria, the staph 
bacteria, very effectively,” Batich said, refer-ring to the bandage’s make-up. “99.999 per-
cent of the bacteria that touch it get killed.”
According to Schultz, 
studies show the NIMBUS bandage could be worn for seven days without having 
to be changed, versus other 
dressings that contain large 
quantities of bacteria after 24 hours.
Ultimately, Schultz said the FDA  decided 
to classify the bandage as a new medical de-vice.
“This took three years to get approval. 
There was a lot of back and forth talking to the 
FDA,” he said. “Because it has FDA approval, 
companies have decided to license it. They start selling it around June this year.”
According to Batich and Schultz, the whole process took about nine years.
“When we first started out, it was sort of 
Batich, Toreki and me,” Schultz said. “As we became more successful in understanding how to do this and how to make it more effective, Quick-Med kept enlarging the lab, and now there are 7 full-time employees in Gainesville – they’re all UF graduates.”
Schultz said the major breakthrough oc-
curred because of UF graduate Toreki.
“What we developed the first time worked 
great in the lab, but it didn’t work well and scale up to industrial levels,” Schultz said, adding that Toreki made the manufacturing process fit for a broader scale and less costly.
Due to the bandage’s usefulness and rela-

Students should slow 
down during spring break
Column
Partisanship proves grand ol’ loyaltyPerhaps the understatement of the year would be to say 
that we live in a time of economic uncertainty.
Scour the headlines featured in major news outlets, 
and you will quickly learn the latest in recession-proof tricks to save cash at the supermarket or what counties across the na-
tion are currently suffering the worst unemployment rates.
Yes, without any hint of uncertainty, America is enduring 
one of the harshest times in its history. Yet, what are we sup-
posed to do? How should we respond other than by giving our goddamn best shot at leading a decent and fulfilling life?
Take another gander at The New York Times or CNN.com 
and you’ll read about the recent tragedies that are making their way into water cooler conversation. Just down the road in Clearwater, three men, two of which were NFL players, pre-
sumably lost their lives in the wake of a fishing trip gone ter-
ribly wrong. Word out of Pakistan informs us of a terrorist at-tack on a Sri Lankan cricket team that left players and coaches injured after gunfire riddled their bus with bullet holes.
Yes, even the semi-charmed lives of professional athletes 
are not guaranteed a tomorrow. For the Sri Lankan cricket team, will their ever-so-close brush with death cause them to reassess their outlook on life? If they had perished, would the members of the team have been satisfied with what they ac-
complished during their short time on Earth?
The unfortunate incidents in Florida and across the globe 
paint a stark picture that should serve to remind us that we are 
guilty of taking our lives far too seriously. 
We must dig hard and dig deep to find some semblance of 
good to come out of our country’s dire state of affairs. Perhaps a return to the core values of America can work to reunite a country that has placed too much of an emphasis on the ma-terialistic, tangible items of disillusionment that have bred a 
corrosion of morals and ethics.
To say that life is fleeting comes across as nothing more 
than a trite cliché that gets recycled and regurgitated every 
few months or so. 
Yet, when people fail to heed such advice, do we really 
even retain the right to declare that this adage is overused? Do we not need an occasional reminder to keep from falling victim to the stress that stems from factors out of our control?
We can only begin to guess how much time we have left 
on Earth — that is not to say we are suggesting you give up everything and become a missionary or a priest. 
Rather, simply be grateful for what little (or what riches) 
you may have — a shortcoming few are more guilty of than this very author. Those blessed souls who can find pleasure in the things that come without a price tag are, indeed, the true lucky ones.
Surely this will not occur overnight, but rather should be 
viewed as a gradual process that will eventually reap the fruits 
of your labor if you should choose such a righteous path.
As we go our separate ways for the week — whether to 
Acapulco or simply a quick jaunt home — the Editorial Board 
implores you to take a deep breath and catch yourself before you get caught up in a stressful financial situation that easily could have been avoided. 
So what if you had to dish out $8 for a bottle of Corona 
at the bar or your mom yelled at you for spending too much money during a shopping spree at the mall?
You are young, you are alive and even in the worst of times, 
you will eventually find your way.
Nothing seems more apropos than to steal a line from 
Against Me!’s Tom Gabel: “Please tell me I’m not the only one that thinks we’re taking ourselves too seriously/Just a little too enamored with inflated self-purpose.”
At least for us, it rings far too true.Bipartisanship is a dream; a glorious fantasy 
thought up by politicians who wanted to turn the public against their opponents. In all practicality, 
it doesn’t exist.
All people with strong beliefs are, by definition, par-
tisan. When partisan individuals share similar beliefs, as they often do in our two-party system, these beliefs develop into “partisan issues.” And when an individual holds a belief that doesn’t fit his usual partisan paradigm, he is hailed as a bipartisan hero.
President Barack Obama is demanding bipartisanship 
from the Republicans. This means that he wants them to 
support his agenda whether or not they agree with it. For 
some reason, Americans overwhelmingly desire biparti-sanship from their politicians, even though in any other discipline but politics this would be called “selling out.”
Yet, liberals demand this from conservatives. They 
want them to abandon their conservative principles and embrace moderate (read: liberal) Republicans like Gov. 
Arnold Schwarzenegger and Gov. Charlie Crist. Alliga-
tor columnist Matthew Christ on Monday went so far as to call the moment Republicans sought principle instead of the big-government status quo was “when the modern Republican Party died.”
Republicans already tried big government. We just 
went through eight years of unprincipled, big govern-ment, big spending chaos under former President George W. Bush. The results of the following election: epic fail.
The last thing Republicans need is bipartisanship. 
They need a one-sided, no compromise derailing of the federal leviathan. Conservatives believe that the big gov-ernment that Obama has determined to create will make our country worse off, and only by acting steadfastly in their opposition can they defeat his policies.Yet when Gov. Bobby Jindal 
says this, everyone touts it as the end of his political career.
Yes, Jindal gave a poorly 
delivered speech. The southern bumpkin thing doesn’t work that well for him. Get over it. 
Jindal’s speech, which is 
an excellent speech in writ-ing, stressed a willingness to 
cooperate, free market principles and hope in American ambition. The speech was hardly the end of the Republi-
can Party. Republicans are far from dead; they are alive 
and kicking. Liberals are quick to hop on a mistake as the death of their opponents, and use this to demand ac-quiescence and “bipartisanship” from the demoralized GOP.
Now this would be the death of the Republican Party. 
The Republicans cannot be a “me too” big government 
party; they will only succeed where they meaningfully 
differentiate themselves from the Democrats. They must fight big government uniformly and make it their pri-mary election issue. 
Most Americans are not ideologues; they are self-
interested pragmatists who vote for whoever fosters the economy. If the GOP can successfully blame the coun-try’s problems on big government, then they will retake power overnight. If they give in to bipartisanship, then they become “Diet-Democrats” who stand for nothing.
So go out and proudly call yourself a partisan. It 
shows you have convictions, beliefs, and a willingness to do what you know is right for your country.

I am not about to resort to the name-call-
ing that Spanky from the Little Rascals, 
or a certain journalism-and-German ju-
nior at UF for that matter, would employ 
as his first response to a female threaten-
ing his self-proclaimed territory. 
For, unlike a 7-year-old prepubescent 
male, I see a disturbing significance in re-ferring to the gym, or any public space, as 
divided between a “female” and a “good” side. Yet, before I delve into the absurdity 
of these “unwritten” rules of the gym that 
Joshua Nederveld tells of so confidently, I must bring to light the further implications 
of Emily Congdon’s prompt response. 
Emily, while your endeavor to de-
nounce Nederveld’s dismissal of women’s benching as “chauvinistic” is noteworthy, 
it still perpetuates the ideal that predomi-nant male ability in the gym is the touch-
stone to which women should aspire. Your 
surefire praise of “plenty of other [girls] who squat just as much as most guys” and 
denouncement of “2.5 pound-lifting, nail-
breaking girls” as “annoying” is detrimen-tal to your claim from a feminist perspec-
tive; are you, too, suggesting that women 
should just go to the gym to obtain some almighty brute strength? 
Can they not just go to release some 
endorphins, tone, relieve stress, etc?  In addition, how dare you fall into the trap of classifying women as “pretty girls” and 
“tomboys?” And how dare you call men 
“gorillas?” 
Surely, you cannot be so simple-mind-
ed as to disregard the complexities behind gender identity and assume that “pretty girls” have to lift 2.5 pounds while “tom-
boys” bench-press. In your response, 
which you likely deemed a heroic, wrath-ful calling out of patriarchy’s connotation 
of woman as deviant, you actually man-
aged to maintain Nederveld’s negative stigma attached to woman as “the angry 
girl,” or the “dollish RecSports girl with 
platinum blonde highlights” and other mythical figments of femininity that clas-
sify women as inferior.
It would be very easy to call Nederveld 
a “chauvinistic, pea-for-a-brain, wannabe meathead” as Congdon has so powerfully 
done, yet I know that this is just what he wants. 
Nederveld, your “unwritten rules” can 
be applied to all aspects of society, and yet I fear that they will soon come 
to show you just 
where you really fit into them. I 
see that you are 
a journalism major –you, the hypermascu-
line macho male who can lift more than a 
woman, you with your high-demand de-
gree will undoubtedly be the breadwin-ner of the family to boost that tiny ego of 
yours. 
Excuse me, is that an unwritten rule 
you’re breaking? 
My legs may not be slender and I may 
not own a fire-red bust-boosting one-piece, 
but I am a lifeguard who frequently hits 
the gym and lifts “silly” weights so that in 
the unlikely event that you drown while “people-watching,” I can pull you out of 
the water and save your life. 
Are you certified, Mr. Fitness? 
Oh, Nederveld, the world is chock-full 
of common misconceptions that you have been unfortunately blinded into believing are common truths. I am happy to say that 
unlike your unlucky counterparts you will 
likely never be branded as “effeminate,” for heaven-forbid your half-naked, sweaty strong-holds on your male workout part-
ners would ever be taken as anything but 
upholding the highest essence of hetero-normativity. 
The only value behind your astute ob-
servations, which you generously deem paralleling those of Jane Goodall, is that 
they reveal the nonsensical nature of the 
“good” side of the gym and that women surely need not be intimidated by bench-
ing to their heart’s content. Speaking of 
Goodall, for your information she studied chimpanzees, not gorillas. Funny how you 
pride yourself in your unparalleled rec-
ognition of the differences between male and female gym-goers yet simultaneously, 
journalism major, fail to distinguish one 
entire species of ape from another. 
Pray, take a moment from your monu-
mental “revolution”  and try to distin-guish it from a pathetic act of cowardice. (That was a trick statement, I know it’s 
actually impossible). To reference your 
anti-90s, anti-Kelly Clarkson godsend that is AC/DC, “To those without a cock, we 
saluuuute you!”

An artist’s rendering of the proposed columbarium.
likely be built near Lake Alice at the Medicinal Gar-
dens. A preliminary artist’s rendering depicts a series 
of short, unassuming brick walls with square open-
ings for storing urns.
He said UF plans to sell the spots for between 
$3,000 and $5,000, but does not plan to make any money off the sales.
If the bill passes, he said UF would wait until about 
300 spots were reserved before starting construction.
Other schools, like Notre Dame and the University 
of Virginia, already have columbaria on their cam-
puses.
For those who don’t fancy the idea of having their ashes placed on display, there are other options.
Orlando said UF gets about a dozen calls a year 
from people wanting to have their ashes spread on 
Florida field, which UF has no problem with.
He also admitted some people may spread ashes 
around other parts of campus without asking.
“If somebody wanted to go do that at Lake Alice 
they could simply go do it,” he said. “We would never really know about it.”
Another option is to be buried in a UF-themed cas-
ket. Collegiate Memorials, based in Macon, Ga., sells them for $3,290 each. UF gets a 10 percent licensing fee on each casket.
“It wouldn’t be my personal choice, but I have no 
doubt there are people out there who would think that is a wonderful thing,” Orlando said.Spots would cost between $3K and $5K

G a i n e s v i l l e  r e s i d e n t s  a n d  v i s i t o r s .                                                            W h i l e Officer Ray Metrick waited for a potential DUI last Fri-
day night, a suspicious call popped up on his computer 
screen. 
He went from being parked in the lot to speeding 50 
mph down Museum Road in seconds. He was rushing to 
support another officer in case the situation turned ugly. 
A few street lamps illuminated UF’s  Surge Area off 
Archer Road. A little sports car was parked under gnarled 
branches that rocked from the cold wind. A flashing po-
lice car was already there, and two police officers were conversing in concentration. 
Metrick stepped out of the car and into the cold. Other 
cars zoomed by on Archer Road as he ambled over to join the other officers. It was a DUI. 
A man who looked to be in his 30s stumbled and 
swayed his way through his early-morning field sobriety 
tests. 
He couldn’t touch his nose or walk a straight line. The 
breathalyzer back at the station would read that his blood 
alcohol content was well over twice the legal limit.
Metrick helped administer the field sobriety tests with 
an unruffled patience that comes with years of experi-
ence. He had rushed to the scene before anyone could 
assign him the task. As he lay down silver tape on the uneven road, an unspoken trust flowed between the three officers.  
Every officer had help only minutes away that night. 
Metrick described law enforcement as a type of “brother-hood,” an unspoken dedication to assist new officers and to admire police who have been active in law enforcement for a decade or more.
“There’s always an understanding that you’ve been 
around,” he remarked.Officers form brotherhood 
after years of patrollingers from Williams Elementary 
that asked UF President Bernie Machen not to take away their student interns.
Katie Milton, a doctoral stu-
dent in the College of Education at UF who started the Facebook 
Group “Save Undergraduate 
Education at UF,” said after the event that she thinks UF’s deci-sion to consider cutting under-graduate education and nursing programs at UF smacks of sex-
ism.
“I think it’s not a mistake that nursing and education were both 
specifically targeted when those are the two highest populations of women we have on our cam-
pus,” she said.
“If UF wants to go back to be-ing an all-male college then they 
should come right out and say that,” she said. 
“They shouldn’t kick off their 
two dominant populations of women.”About 150 people gathered to perform skits, read letters at protest

If you don’t plan on leaving the sight of the shore this spring break, give 
your brain a break from Margaritaville with one of these beach reads. It 
will compensate for all the reading you didn’t do this semester.
 1)The Host, Stephenie Meyer
It turns out Meyer doesn’t just write about brooding vampire sexy-time. 
In yet another unlikely romance, try to follow this alien-human love tri -
angle. It’s either sci-fi or comedy, which is entertainment either way. 
2)Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance, Barack 
Obama
Now that we’re more than a month into his presidency, it’s a good time 
to read up on Barack Obama’s life before he became Mr. Prez. It’s basi -
cally your history book, except it’s actually interesting.  
3)Act Like a Lady, Think Like a Man: What Men Really Think About 
Love, Relationships, Intimacy, and Commitment, Steve Harvey 
Ladies, this will be your bible next week. Consult it as you make your way 
through your annual spring fling.  
4)Secrets, Jude Deveraux
With a title like Secrets, you just know it’s scandalous. This is that tacky ro -
mance novel that you read incognito (it’s OK, tear off the book sleeve). Hide 
it in your beach bag all you want, but it’s still your favorite book, secretly.

March 5, 2009How does a person remember to 
forget?
This is just one of the stimulat-
ing questions “Eurydice” raises in 
its sorrowful yet playful retelling of 
the Greek myth.
In the play currently being per-
formed at the Hippodrome, writer 
Sarah Ruhl, a former Pulitzer nomi-nee, reinvents the timeless love sto-ry in modern day. 
The play is an enigmatic fairytale 
adventure between the underworld and the land of the living that ques-
tions how to deal with parting with 
a loved one. The play opens with a stunning soft aquamarine colored set as both Eurydice (Marybeth Gor-man) and Orpheus (Niall McGinty) play on the beach and speak poeti-cally of their love for each other. 
Although the 
opening scene is 
beautiful, it offers 
nothing but confu-sion to the audi-ence because the poetic language is difficult to under-
stand. However, the chemistry be-
tween Gorman and McGinty keeps you wanting more. 
As the play progresses, the set, 
the costumes and the twisted plot keep you enthralled in the story, feeling a great combination of grief, sorrow, love and delight.
When Eurydice is lured from 
her wedding reception by a nasty man (Rusty Salling) who claims to have letters from her dead father (D. Christopher Wert), her life and her place in the world is forever al-tered.
Eurydice is reunited with her fa-
ther in the underworld, creating a 
gripping relationship that has been 
given a second chance. 
“What drew me to this play was 
the relationship between father and daughter,” Gorman said. “This kind of relationship is so compelling.”
The show offers a brilliant ward-
robe that includes fresh, lively cos-tumes with bows and flowers. The 
attention to detail is obvious, and 
the red-clad Lord of the Underworld even sports red toenail polish. 
The set also makes the night-
mare seem like a fantasy with light-ing that can be as disturbing as it is 
lovely. But what’s most fantastic is 
the raining elevator Eurydice travels in to get to the underworld, which encapsulates the magic of the show.
The play is unusual and elicits 
a clutter of feelings, but sadness reigns—as the story focuses on death and life thereafter.
 However, “Eurydice” will leave 
the audience pondering over the storyline and treasuring the brevity of life.  
“A sad story is a beautiful story,” 
Gorman said. “And this one makes me feel more alive.”
The play runs eight shows a week 
through March 22 and student tick-ets are available for $12.THURSDAY, MARCH 5, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 11 10, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, MARCH 5  , 2009

A band plays while people mingle on the second floor of the Sharab Lounge 
on Monday night before a runway show .

A model in the Wolfgang Spring/Summer 2009 fashion show wears a Paul & Joe Sister dress.
Sarah Hsu / Alligator Staff
Models in the Wolfgang 
fashion show wear a Rubber 
Ducky dress (model above) 
and a Modern Amusement 
button-up and blazer with 
Just USA shorts (right).
  Backstage models 
danced to shake off any 
last minute jitters while 
simultaneously wish -
ing, “Please don’t let me 
fall.” 
In the audience 
Monday night, some 
attendees ignored the 
fact that Zach Braff was 
among them, while oth -
ers shamelessly circled 
the star, talking him 
up for pictures and  a 
good laugh if they were 
lucky. 
This was the first 
fashion show that kicked 
off Gainesville Fashion 
Week.
In the past, Sharab 
Lounge has been the 
host of many fashion 
and art shows. These 
successful events led 
Gustavo Bonet of Shar -
ab to team up once again 
with local artists, design -
ers and boutiques to cre -
ate a full-blown festivity 
of the show. Each show 
starts off with Bonet say -
ing, “Happy Gainesville 
Fashion Week.”
For its debut, GFW 
consisted of alterna -
tions between cocktail 
parties, art exhibits and 
fashion shows revealing 
the style of Gainesville’s 
chicest boutiques, com -
plete with a red carpet 
and cocktails.
In true fashion week 
spirit, the event was a 
bit less crowded than 
expected, as cold weath -
er, empty pockets and 
midterms kept many 
at home. But what the event lacked in capacity 
it made up for in beauti -
ful clothes and art. 
Show after show was 
filled with colorful mini 
dresses and patterned 
sheath dresses, sure to 
become wardrobe sta -
ples for Gainesville girls 
in the summertime. 
The main look for 
guys consisted of nar -
row jeans, patterned 
button-downs, printed 
tees and jackets. 
Tonight, the event 
will come to an end with 
the ultimate mix of local 
artistry and fashion -- 
Gainesville’s very own 
designer Bobby Kelley’s 
line. 
Kelley promises to 
blow peoples’ minds 
tonight with what he 
said will be a truly high-
fashion, high-quality 
collection.
 For his segment, Kel -
ley will present four dif -
ferent collections back 
to back. The names he’s 
chosen for the collec -
tions--Cupcake, Sixties, 
Brazil and S&M--give a 
glimpse as to the varied 
assortment that will be 
shown. 
Although Gainesville 
is filled with talented 
artists and fashionis -
tas, rarely do the two 
unite. Gainesville Fash -
ion Week effectively 
changed that. The town 
had the opportunity to 
be impressed with the 
talent that, often un -
knowingly, surrounds 
us every day.Gainesville

POLL QUESTION I DID NOT KNOW THAT SCOREBOARDHarrison Diamond / Alligator Staff 
UF forward Alex Tyus tries to shoot past Tennessee’s Brian Williams during the Gators’ 
79-75 loss to the Volunteers in the O’Connell Center on Sunday.
By MIKE DiFERDINANDO
Alligator Staff Writer
mdiferdinando@alligator.org
The sky may have finally hit the ground 
for the Gators.
Bulldogs center Jarvis Varnado scored 
13 points and grabbed eight boards as Mis-
sissippi State (18-12, 8-7 Southeastern Con-
ference) beat UF (21-9, 8-7 SEC) 80-71 on 
Wednesday night in Starkville, Miss.
It was the third straight defeat for the 
Gators and one that will deliver a crushing blow to their NCAA Tournament hopes.
“Our weakness got exposed,” UF coach 
Billy Donovan said. “They threw the ball into Varnado a few times, and he got to the basket.”
Guard Nick Calathes hasn’t had many 
bad nights this season, but this was one of them.
The sophomore played just 28 minutes 
and watched from the bench as his team tried to mount a late comeback.
“(Nick) has to understand how to incor-
porate the rest of the team,” Donovan said. “He wants to take it all on his shoulders, but 
there are four other guys that, with his pass-
ing and vision, he can make better.”
Calathes finished with 11 points. It was 
the first time since Nov. 20 against Southern Utah that he failed to make a three. Calathes has knocked down 64 3-pointers this year.
Mississippi State came into the game rid-
ing a three-game losing streak, but the Bull-
dogs’ unconventional four-guard lineup 
caused problems all night for the Gators, who shot just 28 percent from the 3-point line.
“Some of our early threes led to the floor 
being unbalanced,” Donovan said. “We al-most took away our own energy at certain 
points. We didn’t shoot the ball great.”
Entering the contest, Mississippi State led 
the SEC in 3-pointers made per game at 8.5, 
while UF was second to last at defending the 3-point line.UF MEN’S BASKETBALLGators’ tournament hopes in jeopardy
� ANTHONY DeSCLAFANI IMPROVED 
IN HIS SECOND CAREER START.
By BOBBY CALLOVI
Alligator Writer
bcallovi@alligator.org
Anthony DeSclafani headed to the dugout 
in the sixth inning after giving up his first hit 
of the night and could only watch as the bull-pen gave the game away.
Behind a 6-run sixth inning, Florida Atlan-
tic upset UF 7-6 on Wednesday at McKethan Stadium.
Junior Tony Davis was the first reliever out 
of the bullpen for the Gators (6-4) in the sixth and entered with the bases loaded and one out. After striking out the first batter he faced, 
Davis allowed 2 runs to score on a passed ball 
and a wild pitch — both with two strikes on the batter. 
UF coach Kevin O’Sullivan turned to an-
other veteran pitcher in Billy Bullock after a walk by Davis. But Bullock wasn’t able to stop the bleeding either, allowing two singles to drive in three 3 runs, and he balked home the sixth run of the inning before getting the final out.
“We were one strike away from getting out 
of the inning,” O’Sullivan said. “Then, we had a passed ball, we had a wild pitch, we had a balk. (Those are) things you don’t necessarily 
see from older pitchers, but it was very frus-
trating.
“It’s not what you hope to see from older 
pitchers, but that’s what happened tonight.”
The Gators were able to respond to the 
Owls’ big inning with a 2-run inning of their own to tie the game at 6.
Following two walks by Bullock to start the FAU’s 6-run sixth inning leads to UF lossLast night in Starkville, 
Miss., a small city that just 
24,000 people call home, 
the UF men’s basketball team’s season died quietly in its sleep.
It was 110 days old.The team suffered from a lack 
of size and a heavy reliance on the 3-pointer its entire life and finally lost the battle with those ailments during an 80-71 loss 
to Mis-
sissippi 
State.  Though the  
Gators  
hoped to live long enough to ad-
vance  
to the 
NCAA Tournament, hope was not enough to keep them alive. 
When sophomore guard Nick 
Calathes was pulled from the game with about three minutes remaining Wednesday night, coach Billy Donovan was pulling 
the plug on the season.
The constant pressure of try-
ing to live up to the Gators’ na-
tional championship teams of 
2005-06 and 2006-07 was also 
cited as a cause of death.
The Gators showed promise 
early in the season, beginning the year with a 16-2 record that 
included wins in its first three 
Southeastern Conference games.
The team’s notable accom-
plishments include an early sea-
son victory against current No. 
16 Washington and a comeback victory against North Carolina State where Calathes scored 24 second-half points. The Gators 
were also undefeated at home 
until losing to Tennessee on Saturday. Calathes was a man among boys, leading the team in 
points per game, assists, 3-point 
percentage and defensive re-bounds, and fans should pay R.I.P. ’09

The Bulldogs made 10 threes, shooting 50 percent from 
distance.
Coming into the game, Mississippi State led the SEC in 
blocked shots at 7.9 per game. Varnado averages 4.8 blocks 
per game.
UF went to 6-foot-10, 250-pound Kenny Kadji early to 
match up with the much thinner Varnado.
It seemed to work, as the Gators managed to hold the big 
man to just two blocks.The Bulldogs led 42-33 at halftime, and the Gators are 
now 1-6 this season when trailing at the half.
UF came out fast in the second half 
and cut Mississippi State’s lead to 48-44 with 15 minutes to play.
But Mississippi State rallied back, 
shooting its way to a 66-51 lead after a 13-3 run with just less than seven min-utes left. It was the Bulldogs’ biggest lead of the game.
UF’s largest lead of the game was just 2 points, and the 
team never led in the second half.Forward Ray Shipman went down with a bloody lip late 
in the second half but did return to the game.
Guard Walter Hodge led all scorers with 20 points. It is 
the second time he has reached the 20-point mark this sea-son. The first came in the loss to Georgia on Feb. 14.
The senior was brought to tears during a team huddle 
late in the game.
“In all my years of coaching, I’ve never seen anything like 
that,” Donovan said. 
“He wants to win so bad. He’s trying to inspire the 
guys.”
A radio broadcast contributed to this report.Senior guard notches 20, brought to tears in huddle late in game
seventh inning, O’Sullivan turned to his staff’s ace, Patrick Keating, to end the threat, and he did just that as he stranded the two Florida At-lantic runners.
Keating could not keep the Owls off the 
board entirely, though, as he allowed a run off a sacrifice fly in the eighth that gave the Owls a 7-6 lead.
While Keating relinquished the lead, he did 
not get any help from the Gators’ hitters.In the eighth and ninth innings, UF had 
two runners on base but were unable to get them in.
The team’s best chance to win came in the 
ninth with runners on first and second with no outs, but the next three batters went down 
in order — including a failed sacrifice bunt at-
tempt by Brandon McArthur with no outs.
“It’s always the ninth inning that is mag-
nified, but we had a runner at third with less than two outs with (Mike) Mooney up (in the third inning), and we didn’t drive him in,” O’Sullivan said.UF has struggled to hit with runners in 
scoring position this season, and it was an is-sue again Wednesday. The team left five run-
ners in scoring position.
“We got to have that big hit in late innings,” den Dekker said. “Someone has got to step up 
and come through, and it didn’t happen to-night.”
Although the bullpen could not hold the 
lead, DeSclafani recovered from a poor show-ing in his first start Feb. 25 when he gave up 5 
runs in three innings of work.
He worked 5 1/3 scoreless innings while 
striking out seven Wednesday.
“I really wanted to get back out there to-
day and redeem myself,” DeSclafani said. “I 
worked ahead more and kept (the hitters) off-balance.”Gators miss prime opportunities for comeback in eighth, ninth innings
their respects to a player who may 
well never grace the O’Connell Cen-ter again after this season.
Despite all those positives, brack-
et makers will be unable to look past the last-second losses to South Caro-lina and Kentucky, the blowout at the hands of Tennessee, a maximum of nine wins in a weak conference and the embarrassing defeat against 
Georgia. UF’s 2-7 record in away 
games, cemented by Wednesday’s loss to Mississippi State, put the final nail in the team’s coffin.
Mississippi State’s 10 3-pointers 
and the inside play of Jarvis Varna-do were too much for UF — already on its deathbed — to handle. Every time the ball went down low to Var-nado, the scoreboard operator had 
his finger on the button that would 
put 2 points on the board for the Bulldogs. More often tihan not, he pushed that button moments later.
The Gators are survived by the 
SEC Tournament, their last-ditch ef-fort to make it to the Big Dance, but all odds point to an early exit. UF is also survived by its son, the 2009-10 basketball season, which promises to 
improve on its father’s lack of front-
court depth but might be lacking its most important member in Calathes. This team’s father, the 2007-08 bas-ketball season, suffered a similar de-
mise, and this team certainly viewed 
its dad as a role model.Funeral services will be held on 
March 17 during the opening round of the National Invitation Tourna-
ment. 
All are welcome to attend, but the 
team’s relatives do not expect a large 
audience. Any signs of life should be disregarded.
Rest in peace, 2008-09 UF basket-
ball season.

Walking away with a confer-
ence victory on Wednesday was 
something Santa Fe College base-
ball coach Johnny Wiggs and his 
team focused on.
After losing four straight 
games, the Saints were deter-
mined not to start conference play 
with a loss. They didn’t.
SFC (10-11, 1-0 Mid-Florida 
Conference)  defeated St. Johns River Community College 10-0 
when a mercy rule ended the 
game after 6 1/2 innings.
“We talked about letting go 
of what has happened in non-conference games and reminded 
them that we are going to look 
at conference stats,” Wiggs said. “That is what we care about, our conference record.”
It appeared SFC’s starting 
pitcher, Bobby Bolling, was go-ing to continue the losing streak during the first inning when two Vikings got on base quickly. After 
catching a runner stealing sec-
ond and tagging another at home 
plate, the Saints 
managed to es-cape the inning 
without allow-
ing a run.
“Like I al-
ways say, great 
baseball starts 
on the mound,” 
Wiggs said. “Bolling has been our most consistent guy, and that’s why he started Game 1 of confer-
ence play.”
The Saints began making their 
move during the bottom of the 
fifth, when the entire order came to the plate. SFC had six hits and 
6 runs during the inning, pushing 
their lead to 7-0 and essentially sealing SJRCC’s fate.
Freshman catcher Brett Boze-
man hit a double in the top of the sixth inning, driving in the final 2 runs for the Saints.  
After six innings, the Saints led 10-0, and the Vikings had 
one more opportunity to cut the 
lead before the game was called. SJRCC was unable to pull togeth-er during the top of the seventh inning and ended the game on a 
strikeout.
“We had errorless baseball, and 
when you have errorless baseball, 
you are going to be successful,” 
Wiggs said. “We looked great out 
there today.”  
SFC will face SJRCC again on 
Friday in Palatka at 4 p.m.SAnTA fE BASEBAllSaints open conference season with shutout victory
