  For the ﬁ  rst time in his 20 years teaching at UF, 
journalism professor Laurence Alexander has can-
celed his class on the Wednesday before Thanksgiv-
ing.
  This year, he said, a meeting conﬂ  icts with his 
Law of Mass Communication class.
  “And,” he added, “I’m sympathetic to our stu-
dents who must travel home on crowded highways, 
and I want them to arrive safely.”
  Despite the grumblings of students, UF’s Thanks-
giving break does not start until Thursday, UF spokesman Steve Orlando said.
  However, starting next year, UF will cancel class-
es on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, he said.  
  Some professors will cancel or alter their class 
schedules this week to allow students a travel day.
  Instead of giving a lecture to his Sports Media & 
Society class at its normal meeting time and place today, professor Ted Spiker will post his notes on the class blog. Classes canceled 
earlier next yearACTIVISM

  Occupy Gainesville members 
are asking city commissioners 
to keep Bo Diddley Community 
Plaza open 24/7.
  Activists and commission 
members have discussed chang-ing park hours — which are cur-rently from 6 a.m. to 11:30 p.m. — 
so Occupy Gainesville members can stay on the plaza at night. 
Members currently camp on 
the sidewalk next to the plaza at 
night to avoid being arrested for 
trespassing.
  So far, the topic has not been 
sent to a city committee for dis-
cussion, which would be the first 
step toward changing the rule.
  Gainesville City Commis-
sioner Thomas Hawkins said it’s 
practical to keep any park closed for a few hours.
  He said keep-
ing the park 
closed at night 
reduces the pos-sibility of nega-
tive effects to s u r r o u n d i n g 
neighbors and business own-
ers.
  Zot Szurgot, an Occupy Gainesville member, said the plaza is meant to be an area for 
free speech, as signified by the 
speaker’s stone, which sits in the 
middle of the plaza.
  She said she doesn’t think 
anyone expected the curfew to 
interfere with free speech, but 
because it has, she hopes the commissioners will fix the “hon-
est mistake.”
  “That designation still stands, and we would like to see the rules stay consistent with that desig-
nation and our First Amendment 
freedoms,” Szurgot said.
  Hawkins said he would be 
willing to refer the topic to a subcommittee when he feels at least four commissioners believe 
changing the park hours is a good thing to do. 
At the moment, he doesn’t feel 
enough commissioners agree.  Occupy protesters push commission to extend park hours

� HE USED A SKATEBOARD TO BREAK WINDOWS.
  EMILY MORROW
 Alligator Writer
  A UF student was charged with a misdemeanor after van-
dalizing a fraternity house early Sunday morning.
  The Gainesville Police Department said Nicolas Hartley , 19, 
was given a notice to appear in court after he told police he 
used his skateboard to break two windows in the Pi Kappa Al-
pha house, 1904 W University Ave.  Zach Ryan, 20, the fraternity’s president, and Peter D’Amore, 
21, were inside the fraternity house around 3:30 a.m. Sunday 
when they heard breaking glass, according to a police report.
  The men told police they saw Hartley running away from 
the house and chased him down. 
  Hartley was not admitted to jail because his nose was bro-
ken from an earlier ﬁ  ght on an RTS bus. He told police that after the ﬁ  ght on the bus he was told the other people involved were members of Pi Kappa Alpha, and he wanted to get back at them.
  Police estimated the damage done to the windows would 
cost about $600 to repair.  Richard Golightly , the 26-year-old housing director at Pi 
Kappa Alpha, said his room’s window was one of those bro-ken.
  He said vandalism has been a recurring problem for the fra-
ternity house during the semester and that he plans to press charges against Hartley.
  James Newman, president of Zeta Beta Tau fraternity , said 
windows were also broken at its house, 11 Fraternity Drive, around 4 a.m. Sunday.
  Newman said he reported the incident to University Police, 
but no arrests were made.
  Hartley was charged with criminal mischief.   Student arrested for vandalizing fraternity house this weekendSEE CLASSES, PAGE 4News Today

Sit back and relax while drinking a 
beer during Gators games — the frothy 
beverage might actually be good for 
your heart.
According to an analysis by Italy’s 
Fondazione di Ricerca e Cura, moder -
ate consumption of beer could reduce the drinker’s risk of heart disease by 
31 percent.
The Italian foundation based its 
findings on about 200,000 people’s habits of drinking beer, wine and spir -
its.
Previous health studies have in-
dicated that the antioxidants in red wine could help reduce drinkers’ risk 
of cancer, heart disease and diabetes.  
However, it shocks some that beer 
could also have health benefits. 
Chelsea Egozi, a 21-year-old tele-
communication senior, said she 
couldn’t believe the study was real 
due to her dislike for the alcoholic beverage.
“Beer just tastes disgusting,” she 
said. “The carbonation makes you burp.”
While health sciences senior Dunja 
Zelihic, 21, has the same distaste for beer as Egozi, she said she isn’t sur -
prised that beer could be healthy.
“If wine can help, then I guess I see 
nothing wrong with a glass of beer,” Zelihic said.
Alcohol can increase high-density 
lipoprotein, or “good” cholesterol lev-els, which can reduce the risk of hard-ening of the arteries and thickening of the blood, according to a Huffington 
Post article Wednesday. Both risks are 
direct contributors to heart disease.
This may challenge the be-
lief that wine was healthy in spite 
of the alcohol — the drink may be because of it, the article noted.  
According to the study, the best recipe for good heart health is an English pint 
of beer with a strength of 5 percent al-cohol.
Maya Pugh-Jones, a 23-year-old 
sociology senior, enjoys two or three Indian Pale Ales with dinner a couple of nights a week. She said sitting back 
with a good beer is not only healthy 
physically but also mentally.
“Having a beer just takes the edge 
off,” she said. “It’s good for your 
psyche.”

UF is the second most vegan-friendly large uni-
versity in the nation.
The university placed second in the large uni-
versity category of PETA’s Most V egan-Friendly 
College Contest, which began with 32 universities and concluded voting on Nov. 14. Results were an-nounced Monday.
The University of California, Santa Cruz, took the 
top large university spot. Northwestern University won in the small university category.
V egans do not consume any animal products, 
including dairy products, meat, eggs and honey, ac-
cording to PETA’s website.
The incorporation of Meatless Mondays at the 
two on-campus dining halls contributed to UF’s 
ranking this year, said Jared Misner, campaign man-
ager for UF’s Meatless Monday and a 21-year-old 
public relations senior.
Misner is a former Alligator employee.The program campaigns for the dining halls to 
offer meatless menus on Mondays. Dining halls con-tinue to serve meat on Mondays, but there are more vegan options available.
Misner said he thinks UF could win the contest 
if the dining halls offered only vegan fare on Mon-
days.  
Jill Rodriguez, marketing program manager for 
Gator Dining Services, said in an email, “We are very 
excited to be recognized as the No. 2 most vegan-
friendly school in the nation.”
Rodriguez would not say if the university would 
consider offering meatless dining. UF named second

UF’s no-tobacco policy is 
helping to clear the air at other 
universities.
The University of Central 
Florida announced Thurs-
day that the campus will be 
smoke-free by fall 2012.
The university’s smoke-
free task force considered policies at other universities and decided it was most com -
fortable with UF’s, said Me-gan Pabian, spokeswoman for health services at UCF.
Pabian said the task force 
“took a lesson-learned ap-proach” when it looked at the way other universities had ended on-campus smoking.
Like UF, UCF will adver -tise the change on campus ahead of time. Pabian said she 
expects the new measure to go 
into effect in November 2012.
UF went tobacco-free July 
1, 2010, said Jane Emmeree, a health promotion specialist at GatorWell. Emmeree chaired the UF Tobacco Prevention and Cessation Task Force, which recommended the 
change to administrators. 
The university does not 
punish people who smoke on 
campus, said UF spokeswom -
an Janine Sikes. Still, she said the tobacco-free campus effort has been successful.
“I believe we’ve done that 
without enforcement,” she 
said. “We’ve been trying to do 
it positively and through role modeling of others.”UCF aims to imitate

Acne isn’t just a preteen worry 
anymore: It may be reason some-
one isn’t hired for a job.
People with moderate to severe 
acne or prominent birthmarks and scars may be discriminated against in the job market, accord-ing to a recent study conducted by Rice University professor Mikki Hebl and University of Houston  professor Juan Madera.
The study, published in the 
Journal of Applied Psychology, found that in mock interview settings, interviewers were more 
likely to be distracted by a job 
candidate’s facial birthmarks and 
acne and would give that can-
didate a lower evaluation score than one who didn’t have facial 
blemishes.
Madera and Hebl conducted 
two studies: One tracked eye ac-
tivity in undergraduate volun-teers and the other featured expe-
rienced employers.
The first study found that 
the undergraduate volunteers 
couldn’t help but keep their eyes on a person’s facial blemishes in-
stead of his or her eyes or mouth. The second study found that ex-
perienced managers rated appli-
cants with clear skin higher than 
those with scars and blemishes. 
The undergraduate volunteers rated their blemished applicants 
better than the experienced man-
agers did. 
Jill Skufe, a career develop-ment coordinator at the UF Ca-
reer Resource Center, said the 
CRC hasn’t had any students ask 
questions about how acne or fa-
cial scars could play a role in their job searches. 
She said her advice to students 
who may be concerned would 
be to look as presentable as pos-
sible. 
Women shouldn’t go overboard 
with makeup, Skufe advised, but if they are worried, they should 
ask someone close to them.
“Just ask someone you know 
and trust and can be honest to 
you,” she said.Katherine Shearouse, a 22-year-
old public relations senior, agrees 
with the study’s findings.
“If you’re unkempt or have 
zits all over your face, I think people are put off by it,” she said. 
“It may not be professional, but it 
happens all the time.”
But appearance shouldn’t be 
the only factor, she said.
“If you’re completely overqual-
ified and you have a scar, I don’t think they’re not going to hire you 
because of that,” Shearouse said. 
“But if they have someone just as qualified as you are, they would 
rather hire him or her.”Clear skin could improve job prospects, study finds
� RESPONDENTS SAID FOOD QUALITY 
COULD BE IMPROVED.

Meal plans may not be as popular with UF 
students as some might think. 
In a recent study by students in a UF public 
relations research class, the majority of students 
who participated said meal plans offered unsat-
isfactory service and food, according to both a 
focus group and a survey. 
In the focus group, which included a random, 
representative sample of UF students, all stu-dents said the food quality could be “consider -
ably improved” and that food is “sometimes un-
dercooked.”
The survey had 206 respondents and yielded 
similar results.
Participants also said that they didn’t care for 
the dining halls’ hours of operation, saying the halls open too late and close too early on week-
ends. In the focus group, all students who lived off campus did not own meal plans. 
Among students who did live on campus, 
about 60 percent were not sure they would re-new their meal plans. 
A Gator Dining Services marketing program 
director was unreachable for comment at press 
time. 
Carolyn Harnish, a 19-year-old nursing fresh-
man at UF, has a meal plan because of conve-nience. 
However, Harnish is not convinced that hav-
ing a meal plan is the best option. 
“The food at the dining hall is just never 
right,” Harnish said. “Everything needs salt; 
that’s the rule.”
These sentiments may reflect a growing trend 
among students about meal plans. 
CollegeProwler.com, a website that compares 
colleges through student reviews, rated campus dining at UF as a B+. 
Florida State University received a B, the Uni-
versity of Georgia received an A+, and the Uni-versity of Central Florida received an A-.  
Derek LaBrosse, a 20-year-old sport manage-
ment sophomore at UF, decided not to renew his meal plan at the end of his freshman year.
He is a vegetarian, and food selection was a 
problem for him while he had the meal plan. 
“Omelets are good and all, but you can only 
have so many before you get sick of eggs,” La-
Brosse said.Study says meal plans not so popular

Price Increase
Higher minimum wage 
increases unemployment
A recent plan sponsored by Rep. Cliff Stearns, R-Fla., to 
impose minimum wage laws on disabled workers is bad 
news for some with disabilities. 
It’s a simple law of economics. All else being equal, increas-
ing the minimum wage increases unemployment.
According to The Wall Street Journal, a study by economists 
William Even and David Macpherson “finds that among white males ages 16-24, each 10-percent increase in a federal or state 
minimum wage has decreased employment by 2.5 percent. For 
Hispanic males, the figure is 1.2 percent. But among black males 
in this group, each 10-percent increase in the minimum wage has decreased employment by 6.5 percent.”
These age groups are disproportionally affected by increases 
in the minimum wage due to the fact that they are more likely 
to have part-time jobs, which often pay at or slightly above the 
minimum wage. 
Five states (California, Illinois, Nevada, Oregon and Wash-
ington) have some of the highest minimum wages in the country but also face unemployment rates well above the national aver -
age.
Of course, correlation does not imply causation, but from a 
logical standpoint, it makes sense. 
If the government wants to help shoe producers, it wouldn’t 
mandate that shoe producers increase the price of shoes. 
This is a silly notion because the price of shoes is determined 
by the equilibrium between supply (the quantity of shoes sup-
plied and the price that shoe producers wish to sell) and demand 
(the quantity of shoes demanded with the price the consumers 
wish to pay for shoes.) 
Yet somehow, the government believes that in order to help 
laborers, it can defy this economic rule. Supply and demand for labor works the  same way it does for shoes. Instead, in this in-
stance, the labor offered is the supply and the price is a wage. 
Increasing the minimum wage increases the “price” of labor 
and results in a surplus labor supply because businesses adjust 
their hiring habits accordingly . Either they stop hiring altogether 
or cut some low-productivity workers to make up for the in-
crease in labor costs. 
While Rep. Stearns sounds well-intentioned with this policy, 
higher unemployment among workers with disabilities could 
be an unintended consequence like the problems facing younger 
workers.
For workers with disabilities making less than minimum 
wage, employers faced with tight budgets could decide to elimi-
nate these jobs altogether. 
This will not affect everyone, as many of these workers make 
more than the minimum wage. But those who currently make 
below the minimum could go from having a low income to no 
income. 
Which is worse?We should appreciate those holiday meals
I spend an awful large amount of time looking at food 
blogs. Like, a whole lot of time. If you looked at my Google Reader feed, it’s pretty much mostly food 
blogs at this point.
Looking at such fine examples of culinary creations 
every day sort of gives me a mental complex. I call it “food envy.” 
Week after week, these blogs are updated with deli-
cious-looking dishes that I could never hope to achieve in making. I get so mad that I don’t own a stand mixer or an oven. Thanks a lot, dorm life.
Where do you even find figs, at this point?
These bloggers somehow get their hands on some 
of the best ingredients available — the ones in Whole 
Foods that are always outside of my price range.
Needless to say, it got me thinking.
Why are the healthy and organic ingredients or prod-
ucts the most expensive? There are less chemicals and 
pesticides used in their production, so it should cost less for us not to poison ourselves. It’s not fair that the cheapest fruits and vegetables are priced that way be-
cause of the methods of production.
I’d much rather have a large organic apple than a 
puny processed one, but for some reason I’m supposed 
to pay much more because of that.
Does that seem right or fair?I hope some stores are catching on to the idea that 
organic doesn’t have to be so overly priced to be worth selling. I hope organic will become the new norm for produce. It just doesn’t seem necessary to make the 
least-tampered-with fruits and vegetables the most ex-
pensive.
So here I am, complaining about having too many 
food options and prices when some people in this world 
have much more serious food problems to deal with.
I still believe there has to be a way to reduce waste 
while simultaneously boosting either the production of food in other countries or in-
creasing their imports of food. Just like the wealth gap here 
in the United States, there is a 
food gap between us and the rest of the world. 
For that matter, there’s still a 
fairly large food gap within our own country.
According to the Environmental Protection Agency, 
in 2009 the U.S. produced about 34 million tons of food waste, with 33 million tons being thrown away that 
year.
Not only are we selling the best food at the high-
est prices, but we’re also throwing away an amazing 
amount of food. To me, it seems that we are not living 
sustainably.
I’m not going to try to force-feed “hippie” rhetoric 
down your throats. There’s just something wrong with 
the American mindset. 
We’re trained from birth to throw away absolutely 
everything. 
On average, a baby will use between 2,000 and 3,000 
disposable diapers in his or her first year of life, accord-ing to KidsGrowth.com. 
The new iPhone 4S sold about 4 million units in the 
first three days of its release.
The American culture is one of excess, which comes 
from a need to be the best. Being “the best” must mean having the most of the highest-priced items, whether 
we use them or not.
As we run into the holiday season headfirst, try to 
remember the gaps in our community. Support local 
producers whenever you can. If you make a lot of food 
during the holidays, then you’d better eat all of it.

  The AOL Instant Messen-
ger was the direct form of communication back 
in the days of dial-up Internet. It was the only way to talk to our friends and elementary 
crushes without being heard on 
the house phone.
  As we matured and went 
on to middle school and high 
school, social networking 
evolved with us. The mirror self-portrait via hand-held cam-era was born, and the world of MySpace was the only place to 
be seen. If you didn’t have the 
right pictures, the best quotes or the coolest celebrity’s photo under the “role models” sec-
tion, you were a loser.
  MySpace was a gateway 
drug into the world of social 
media. Toward the end of high school, when we became wiser 
and “too mature” for MySpace, the Facebook era began. It is not 
news that Facebook has taken over the world. With more than 800 million users today , Facebook has become a tool 
for both social and professional 
networking. Despite that, Face-book is past its prime.
  Twitter, although it has been 
around since 2006, will soon be the tool to use. The CEO of 
Twitter, Dick Costolo, reported 
in September that more than 100 million users are now ac-tive on Twitter. Still 75 percent 
less than Facebook, Twitter will 
soon become the new Facebook, and Facebook will become the new MySpace. According to Mashable Social Media, there 
are 230 million tweets a day 
and 8,900 tweets per second.
  Unlike Facebook, Twitter 
gives people direct access to 
celebrities. While not everyone 
is obsessed with following a certain famous person’s every move, millions of people are. The top ﬁ  ve followed people ( L a d y G a g a , Justin Bieber, Katy  
Perry , Kim Kardashian and 
Barack Obama) tweet daily on 
their whereabouts and appear-ances. This gives more than 11 million fans desperately de-
sired communication in 140 
characters or fewer.
  If you own the iPhone, a 
Twitter account is coming your way shortly . The 200 
million-plus people who own 
iPhones, according to CNN, will be forced to share via Twit-ter if they have a habit of com-
monly posting photos, videos 
and links. The iOS 5 software, released in early October, in-cludes Twitter integration. Af-ter taking a picture, listening to 
a song or using any of the iP-hone features, a Twitter button 
is ready to be tapped for instant upload. Facebook, available for download on any iPhone, will not be able to survive the ﬁ  erce 
competition Twitter is bringing. 
With Apple endorsing it, ther’s no doubt that Twitter’s popu-larity will increase.
  We have been through a 
lot with Facebook, but sadly 
its time has ended. Soon liking 
comments and stalking pro-ﬁ  les will be a thing of the past. Becoming obsessed with Twit-
ter will not be as dangerous as 
Facebook. Although there are still ways to waste hours scroll-ing through the site, Twitter is a more condensed, savvy way to 
social network.
  If you aren’t quite ready to 
say goodbye to Facebook, treat 
it like a Band-Aid. Deactivate 
it quickly , then post your ﬁ  rst 
tweet.

  When students think about the current condi-
tions in Mexico, it is usually in the context of the images found in news stories: brutal 
executions of “outspoken” Mexican journalists, mass graves plighting the Monterrey countryside or count-
less batches of packaged narcotics acquired by U.S. bor-
der control agents. But all is well if one takes notice of spring break travel advisories, right?
  Unfortunately, Houston happens to be a breeding 
ground for Mexican drug cartels, which have been more than successful in establishing narcotic rings within the Harris county area. Although the dangers of Mexico’s drug cartels appear to remain outside the Texas border, it is only a matter of time before innocent bystanders get 
caught in the crossﬁ  re.
  Attempts to eradicate the supremacy of drug cartels 
in Mexico have been futile. Many local police forces in 
Mexico have either succumbed to the power of local crime syndicates or have been paid off to turn a blind eye to criminal activity . More recently , drug cartels have even tracked down and decapitated Internet users posting coverage or criticism online that defaces their authority.  Mexico is now listed as the second most dan-
gerous country for journalists, according to Reporters 
Without Borders.
  Houston has been a hub for drug and human traf-
ﬁ  cking in connection with Mexican and South American crime organizations for decades. We currently have one of the largest deposits of Los Zetas membership in the nation, a fact commonly accepted by Houston police.
    To the dismay of local law enforcement, Mexican 
drug cartels have taken advantage of street-level gangs in Houston by implementing them in local operations. As a result, it has been difﬁ  cult to track down and identify drug 
activities rooted in Mexican cartels, especially those of 
the Zetas cartel.
  The Houston area alone has almost 10,000 docu-
mented gang members, and the estimated correlations 
between them and the Zetas is beyond police forces.
    With the immense success of advancing their net-
works across Texas, Mexican cartels are now proﬁ  ting off of the recruitment of cheap labor — mainly young adults or even children — to assist in the local distribu-tion of narcotics or other assignments.
  Earlier this year, Houston mourned the loss of a Sug-
ar Land-area teen named Elisabeth Mandala, who was brutally beaten to death in Mexico on what was later discovered to be a botched trip linked to the smuggling of illegal immigrants to the U.S. Other reports conﬁ  rm that children as young as 12 have assisted in the trans-portation of marijuana. Less likely to be suspected by cops, they are coined by cartels as “the expendable” and are typically lured in through a small amount of 
money.
  It appears that despite the growing threat ﬂ  ourish-
ing within our city’s border, the Houston Police Depart-
ment has yet to actually address the obvious issue at hand. True, the task of eliminating or curtailing these criminal syndicates is easier said than done, but it’s best to take a jab at it before it gets worse, which it will.

ST. LOUIS  — The war on methamphet-
amine has gotten some support from Con-
gress — millions of dollars to clean up the toxic waste generated by clandestine labs.
President Barack Obama signed a wide-
ranging appropriations bill Friday that in-cluded the restoration of $12.5 million for meth lab cleanup.
“It’s an awesome thing,” said Tommy 
Farmer, state meth task force coordinator for Tennessee, the state that led the nation in the number of meth labs in 2010. “It keeps us in the fight so we can combat these things.”
The measure restores funding lost in Feb-
ruary, when federal meth lab cleanup money through the Community Oriented Policing Services program ran out and was not re-newed. The program provided $19.2 million for meth lab cleanup in 2010.
That was devastating for some areas of 
the country hit hard by meth. An Associat-ed Press investigation in August found that without federal cleanup money, many local police and sheriff’s departments were far less likely to seek out meth labs they couldn’t af-ford to clean up.
The AP investigation found that the num-
ber of labs seized dropped sharply in states that relied heavily on federal funding for cleanup: down 32 percent through mid-year in Tennessee, 33 percent in Arkansas, 35 per -
cent in Michigan and 62 percent in Alabama.
Experts in those states said it wasn’t be-cause meth use was on the decline. Without federal money, the burden for cleanup fell to the city or county where the meth lab was found, and in an era of dwindling local rev-enues, agencies simply couldn’t afford the cleanup.
Police weren’t turning a blind eye to meth 
but stopped sending agents undercover, conducting door-to-door investigations and setting up stakeouts aimed at catching meth-makers, experts said.
“The words I used were they were less 
proactive,” Farmer said.
Lawmakers from both parties lauded the 
restoration of the cleanup money.
U.S. Rep. Russ Carnahan, D-Miss., said 
meth abuse “destroys communities, tearing families apart and devastating our environ-ment — with every pound of meth produc-ing five to six pounds of toxic waste.”
He said he advocates a response to meth 
abuse that “leverages federal, state and local resources to tackle all aspects of the problem, from research, education and prevention to law enforcement, treatment and remedia-tion.”
A spokesman for U.S. Rep. Scott DesJar -
lais, R-Tenn., said restoration of the meth cleanup money was a “positive” from the ap-propriations bill, even as DesJarlais opposed the spending measure overall.
“The congressman understands how se-
rious of an issue meth production is in the state of Tennessee and remains committed to ensuring that law enforcement is provided with the necessary resources to safely and efficiently dispose of meth labs,” said Robert Jameson, a spokesman for DesJarlais.
Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, noted that 
his state had 239 meth lab seizures in 2010. “For many cities and towns, clamping down on meth labs has been like playing Whack-a-Mole — as soon as one disappears, another one pops up,” he said. “I’m glad that federal funding for meth lab cleanup has been re-stored. Our communities can’t afford to leave dangerous meth labs unattended to.”8, ALLIGATOR §  TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 22, 2011

Fracture, a local glass-print studio featured 
on the “Today Show,” plans to relocate to 
downtown Gainesville this January.
The new facility will be directly in front of 
UF’s recently built Innovation Hub at 110 SW Sixth St. 
Fracture specializes in printing digital pho-
tography for photo decor. 
Instead of printing photos on glossy- or 
matte-style paper and framing the photos in a picture frame, Fracture images are printed di-rectly onto a one-piece glass frame.
The goal of the company is to eventually 
make Fracture images the size of desks, win-dows and even doors, said Abhi Lokesh, a UF alumnus and Fracture’s co-founder and CEO.
The new space will be about 5,300 square 
feet, according to the website of Front Street, the real estate group that negotiated the lease. 
“We’re moving because we’re scaling up 
all our new equipment, and our team growth is outpacing the space we have in the current facility,” Lokesh said.
The company is currently housed at 1901

WASHINGTON — Congress’ super -
committee conceded defeat Monday in 
its quest to conquer a government debt that stands at a staggering $15 trillion, unable to overcome deep and enduring 
political divisions over taxes and spend-
ing.
Stock prices plummeted at home 
and across debt-scarred Europe as the panel ended its brief, secretive existence without an agreement. Republicans and Democrats alike pointed fingers of blame, maneuvering for political advan-tage in advance of 2012 elections less 
than a year away.
The impasse underscored grave 
doubts about Washington’s political 
will to make tough decisions and left a cloud of uncertainty over the U.S. econ-omy at the same time that Greece, Italy, Spain and other European countries are reeling from a spreading debt crisis and recession worries.
Lawmakers of both parties agreed 
action in Congress was still required, somehow, and soon.
“Despite our inability to bridge the 
committee’s significant differences, we end this process united in our belief that the nation’s fiscal crisis must be ad-dressed and that we cannot leave it for the next generation to solve,” the pan-
el’s two co-chairs, Sen. Patty Murray, D-
Wash., and Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Tex., said in a statement.
They added it was not possible to 
present “any bipartisan agreement,” omitting any reference to the goal of $1.2 trillion in cuts over a decade that had been viewed as a minimum for suc-cess.
President Barack Obama — criticized 
by Republicans for keeping the commit-tee at arm’s length — said refusal by the GOP to raise taxes on the wealthy as part 
of a deal that also cut social programs 
was the main stumbling block.
“They simply will not budge from 
that negotiating position,” he said.
Obama pledged to veto any attempt 
by lawmakers to repeal a requirement for $1 trillion in automatic spending cuts that are to be triggered by the su-percommittee’s failure to reach a com-
promise, unless Congress approves an 
alternative approach.
Those cuts are designed to fall evenly 
on the military and domestic govern-
ment programs be-ginning in 2013, and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta as well as lawmakers in both 
parties have warned 
the impact on the Pentagon could be devastating.
“In my four de-
cades involved with public service, I have never been more concerned about the ability of Congress to forge common-sense solutions to the nation’s pressing 
problems,” Panetta, a former House 
budget committee chairman, said in a statement. 
“The half-trillion dollars in additional 
cuts demanded by sequester would lead to a hollow force incapable of sustaining the missions it is assigned,” he said.
In reality, it is unclear if any of those 
reductions will ever take effect, since 
next year’s presidential and congressio-
nal elections have the potential to alter the political landscape before then.
The brief written statement from 
Murray and Hensarling was immediate-ly followed by a hail of recriminations.
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, 
D-Nev., said Republicans had “never found the courage to ignore the tea par -
ty extremists” and “never came close to 
meeting us halfway.”
But Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., who 
authored a GOP offer during the talks, 
said, “Unfortunately, our Democratic colleagues refused to agree to any mean-ingful deficit reduction without $1 tril-lion in job-crushing tax increases.”
Said Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, a 
GOP presidential hopeful, “It’s amazing 
to what lengths he (Obama) will go to 
avoid making tough decisions.”
It was unlikely the outcome would 
materially improve Congress’ public standing which is already well below 20-percent approval in numerous polls.
And the panel’s failure left lawmak-
ers confronting a large and controver -
sial agenda for December, including 
Obama’s call to extend an expiring pay-
roll tax cut and unemployment benefits. Democrats had wanted to add those items and more to any compromise, and lawmakers in both parties also face a struggle to stave off a threatened 27 percent cut in payments to doctors who treat Medicare patients.
Based on accounts provided by offi-
cials familiar with the talks, it appeared that weeks of private negotiations did nothing to alter a fundamental divide between the two political parties. 
Before and during the talks, Demo-
crats said they would agree to signifi-cant savings from benefit programs like Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security only if Republicans would agree to a 
hefty dose of higher taxes, including 
cancellation of Bush-era cuts at upper-income brackets. 
In contrast, the GOP side said spend-
ing, not revenue, was the cause of the government’s chronic budget deficits and insisted the tax cuts approved in the previous decade be made permanent.

Grifﬁ  n vaults back into our 
poll after leading Baylor to a 45-38 upset of then-No. 5 Oklahoma on Saturday. Grifﬁ  n threw for 479 yards on 21-of-34 passing and four scores while adding 72 more yards on the ground. He 
may have had his Heisman moment when he tossed a game-winning 34-yard touchdown to Terrence Williams with eight seconds left in 
the game.

Luck rounds 
out this week’s poll after a nice bounceback per-formance for the Cardinal. After losing to Oregon 
the week before, 
Stanford rebounded with a 31-28 
win against California. Luck com-pleted 20 of 30 passes for 257 yards and two scores as Stanford moved up to No. 6 in this week’s BCS rankings, keeping slim hopes of a shot at a Pac-12,and possibly BCS, title alive.
Keenum falls a spot this week 
after a somewhat pedestrian performance against SMU. He threw for 318 yards while completing 30 of his 45 passes (and becoming the FBS all-time completions leader) but tossed 
a season-low one touchdown in the Cougars’ 
37-7 win. He also tacked on a rushing touch-

but after a 224-yard performance in Wisconsin’s 28-17 win against Illinois. He singlehandedly sparked a struggling Badgers of-fense, accounting for 223 of the team’s 285 yards. Ball added two 
scores on the ground and caught another one to up his season total to 30 touchdowns.Although it was against FCS opponent 
Georgia Southern, Richardson had another impressive performance and stays atop this week’s poll. He rushed for 175 yards on 32 carries and two 
scores. He also hauled in one pass for

The Gators hoped to crack the 
top 20 at the NCAA Champion-
ships. But they barely finished in the top 30.
In the men’s first national cham-
pionship appearance as a team in five years, Florida (780 points) limped to a second-to-last finish, 30th out of 31 teams. Despite be-ing ranked behind 28 of their 30 
opponents, the Gators hoped for a 
promising final race.
“Obviously, [it] was not the fin-
ish we wanted,” coach Todd Mor -
gan said. “But our men’s team had a strong year, made it here to the NCAA championship and saw 
what they need to do to get better 
and to be here again in the future.”
Sophomores Mark Parrish and 
Matt Mizereck, along with fresh-man Jimmy Clark, led the charge for Morgan’s squad all season. Their dominating performances in the Southeastern Conference 
Championship and South Region-
al gave the Gators back-to-back second-place finishes.
But their ef-
forts Monday weren’t enough. Parrish led 
the team with 
a career-best 
mark in the 10k (30:32.9) but finished 68th overall. 
However, Mizereck dropped 
from his usual No. 2 spot to the fifth point-scorer on Monday, finishing 
241st overall. That left senior Josh 
Izewski and freshman J.L. Hines to pick up the slack. Izewski finished 210th, while Hines came in 236th with a career-best 32:21.3 mark.
Those efforts were not enough 
to overcome the sudden fallout by Mizereck, decimating UF’s already slim-chances of competing.
Wisconsin (97 points) topped all 
competitors, winning its fifth title. Florida was unaccustomed to the level of competition, as it mainly raced against conference foes. UF was one of only two SEC schools represented at the meet. 
While the men struggled, UF 
senior Genevieve LaCaze (20:32.0) and junior Florence N’Getich (21:11.1) finished 42nd and 117th overall, respectively, in a field with 
254 runners. 
LaCaze’s 42nd-place finish was 
the best of her career, and it was 
Florida’s second-highest NCAA individual finish since 1997.
“We are really proud of what 
she did today — and as a senior, for everything she’s done for the cross country program and repre-
senting the Gators,” Morgan said.UF cross

The Gators have been strug-
gling to clean up on the glass. 
UF’s minus-0.7 rebounding 
margin bests only LSU’s mi-nus-1.7 mark in the Southeast-
ern Conference, and the Gators 
and the Tigers are the only two teams in the SEC that are losing the battle on the boards to their 
opponents this season.
While encouraged by her team’s rebounding at times against FSU last Thursday, 
coach Amanda Butler was bothered by UF’s failure to play aggressively throughout 
the game.
“I didn’t think we saw that 
type of consistent fight and bat-
tle for possession all the way through,” she said.
Florida held a 20-19 advan-
tage on the boards at the break, 
but Florida State pulled down 
four more than UF in the sec-ond half. 
In three games, Florida has 
pulled down 120 rebounds compared to 122 by its oppo-nents: Michigan, Stetson, and Florida State.
Junior forward Jennifer 
George and senior center Aza-nia Stewart share the team lead with 16 rebounds each. George pulled down a season-best nine 
boards against Stetson while 
Stewart grabbed a team-high six against Michigan and Flor -
ida State.
George and Stewart are 
the squad’s top-two rebound-ers, but Butler does not expect them to carry the brunt of the rebounding load.
“[The post players] know 
that’s a big part of their job to control the paint, especially in the rebounding realm,” Butler 
said. 
“But the guards have got to 
do their part as well.”
Senior guard Lanita Bartley 
is two rebounds shy of the team 
lead and sophomore guard Jaterra Bonds, who tied with Stewart for a team-high six boards against Florida State, 
ranks fourth with 13.
Getting the guards involved 
in the rebounding effort — es-
pecially on the offensive end 
— is key for creating extra pos-
sessions. 
Butler believes that an in-
creased guard presence on the boards will also help the Gators 
clean up on the defensive 
glass. 
UF ranks last in the SEC 
with a .550 defensive rebound 
percentage, surrendering 54 of-
fensive boards.
“When the ball coming off 
the rim is in a guard’s hands, that’s one less pass you have 
to make to get the ball closer to 
the rim going in the other direc-tion,” Butler said.
Florida (2-1) will have to 
keep up the scoring effort down low and pick up the slack on the boards against Hampton (2-0) tonight at 7 in the O’Connell Center. 
The Pirates prevailed in last 
season’s contest, 69-54, win-ning the rebound battle 38-30 and outscoring the Gators 28-16 
in the paint.
“Hampton is a team that will 
just absolutely punish you if 
you don’t box them out,” But-ler said. 
“I would like to see us value 
boxing out and not tipping the ball around as much and put-ting two hands on the ball and 
grabbing it and controlling pos-
session.”Butler wants more from Gators’ rebounding

Coach Amanda Butler said she wants to see forward Jennifer George 
(32) and the Gators box out well against Hampton tonight. 
“I would like to see us 
value boxing out and not 
tipping the ball around 
as much and putting two 
hands on the ball and 
grabbing it and controlling 
possession.”

Florida coach Will Muschamp 
was pleased with how his team 
responded to an early deficit against Furman on Saturday.
However, he wasn’t at all 
pleased with the team’s perfor -
mance that led to that 15-point hole.
“Defense was totally un-
acceptable,” Muschamp said Monday . “Tackling was poor, leverage with the ball, lack of communication in some areas, couple of blown situations for 
touchdowns — just totally unac-
ceptable.”
Florida’s defense was gashed 
early, as it allowed Furman to gain 194 yards on 16 plays through the team’s first three drives, and the Gators once again struggled to stop the run, allowing 233 yards and two touchdowns on 
the ground to the Paladins.Florida was also burned by 
Furman’s Wing-T offense early , 
as well as on a trick play in the first quarter.
While Muschamp said after 
the game it was a matter of “eye-control issues” on defense, Mon-day he said he was disappointed with the way many of his players 
approached the game.
“We’ve got some young guys 
that think 
you’re go-ing to roll your hat out there 
and win games, and that’s not the way it works,” Muschamp 
said. 
“Regardless of your oppo-
nent, you have to prepare all the 
time, so we let them know that after the game, during the game and then this morning. That’s not going to be tolerated.”

TAMPA — Before leaving 
Gainesville, Kenny Boynton 
purposefully stayed late in the 
gym to keep his shooting touch 
fresh. 
Though he rarely has taken 
extra shots in the past, he had 
never started a season this hot 
from three, and he wanted it to continue.
But as Florida warmed up 
in a St. Pete Times Forum more 
known for hosting hockey 
games, Boynton saw his shots clang off the rim and worried that he was in store for a cold 
night.
“I told myself, just in my 
head before the game, I said, ‘I 
hope some luck goes my way be-cause I didn’t have it during the 
shootaround,” he said.
Less than a minute into No. 
10 Florida’s (3-1) neutral-site 
matchup against Wright State 
(2-2), Boynton sank the first of 
his game-high six 3-pointers to help propel the Gators to a 78-
65 win.
In 33 minutes on the court, 
Boynton made half of UF’s threes 
and scored 22 points as fellow starters Erving Walker and Brad 
Beal combined to shoot 2 for 11 
from behind the arc.
His extra work has paid off 
in a pair of 20-plus-point games and a team-leading 19 points per game this season. 
“Last year, I’d probably have 
a good shooting day and just go to practice and take a day off and not shoot after,” Boynton said.
Even with Boynton leading 
a 44 percent shooting charge 
from three, coach Billy Donovan 
was not always happy with the Gators’ shot selection. Florida only made eight field goals in the second half and allowed Wright State to creep within sin-gle digits twice.
“The encouraging part of 
some of our 3-point shooting right now is at least tonight Erik knocked down a couple threes, but Erving and Brad Beal did 
not shoot the ball particularly 
well,” Donovan said.
The Gators were also thinned 
in their front line for the second 
game in a row when sophomore center Patric Young left the floor after being poked in the eye by a 
Raiders defender. Young sat the last minute of the opening half and didn’t re-enter until 10:53 left in the second.
“He had pretty significant 
blurred vision in the locker room, but before he went out there he felt like he was getting better,” 
Donovan said. “Any time you 
take Patric off the floor — he’s a good player — it always has an effect on your team.”
Florida was fouled four times

Billy Donovan is facing an 
identity crisis. 
He wants Florida to be 
a team that grinds out baskets in the low post and can consistently throw it inside to sophomore cen-ter Patric Young and junior for -
ward Erik Murphy. 
The problem is, Young and 
Murphy aren’t true back-to-the-basket scorers, and Florida’s ros-ter is built to do two things: run 
and gun.
The alternative is to keep forc-
ing it inside to Young for his sig-
nature awkward baby hook/shot-
put, the best move in a low-post 
arsenal that lacks refinement, to say the least. 
Donovan is a smart man. He 
wants what he wants for a rea-son. So far this season, 43.4 per -
cent of the Gators’ attempts have been from three, and recent his-tory has shown that number to be unsustainable. During 
the past five years, 
not one of 
the 20 Fi-nal Four t e a m s 
shot three-
pointers at 
such an outrageous rate. The only one that was close was last year’s VCU team, at 41.2 percent. 
In fact, 12 of those 20 teams 
were at 33 percent or lower. 
Although the Gators have 
taken a high volume of 3-point 
shots, it’s not at all like they have 
abandoned the paint. In fact, the key to getting so many open looks against Wright State was precise-ly the opposite. Guards driving the lane or throwing it inside to 
Young and Murphy created the 
majority of UF’s open looks from Built to shoot, Gators 
facing no other choice

  For Taylor Unroe and her family, butterﬂ  ies 
and fairies have always served as a symbol. 
  She doesn’t quite know how to explain it 
or know if it’s weird, but Unroe can remember 
the fairy song her great grandmother made up 
and used to sing to her and her siblings.
  “Our family loves fairies and butterﬂ  ies,” 
she said. “That’s like our thing.”
  When she was 15, Unroe visited Florida. 
Unlike most recruits, the ﬁ  nal selling point 
for Unroe wasn’t the 17 Southeastern Confer-ence championships, the plush volleyball-on-
ly practice courts and other facilities or even 
the idea of playing for the winningest college coach since 1991. 
  During the visit, Unroe and her mother, 
Shelby, heard about the Butterﬂ  y Rainforest 
exhibit at the Florida Museum of Natural His-
tory on campus. A visit was something neither could pass up. 
  What followed was an opportunity for re-
ﬂ  ection and a moment of clarity . 
    
  When Mike Lingenfelter decided to bring 
a 15-year-old Unroe onto one of the nation’s most elite club volleyball teams for girls up to 18, he had concerns.
  As a member of the Muncie (Ind.) Mun-
ciana Samurai, she would be forced to mesh with high school seniors nearing college ca-reers. Lingenfelter doubted she would be able to communicate with them.
  “My ﬁ  rst thought was that it was going to 
be a huge social issue for her,” Lingenfelter said. “She was physically capable.”
  Unroe has played volleyball since she was 
4, progressing through elementary school with the help of her gym teacher, current Ball State volleyball coach Steve Shondell. 
  Her talent and experience were unmatched. 
But during her ﬁ  rst year on the Samurai, Un-roe’s abilities didn’t transition onto the court. 
  Early on, Lingenfelter noticed problems. 
He said Unroe just “wasn’t very good,” add-ing there was a clear lack of focus and a broken 
nature in which she carried herself. 
  Both Unroe and Lingenfelter recall the day 
he pulled her aside before practice. Unroe said 
her coach had heard rumors she was con-templating quitting the team, something she attributed to the gossip-heavy small town of Muncie, Ind.
  A simple chat became what Unroe de-
scribed as a “Come to Jesus” meeting, ending in tears and mutual understanding. Lingen-felter’s talk stretched into practice time, cut-ting the day’s work for the Samurai. 
  There was good reason.  “That little period where she was strug-
gling in practice also coincided with the death of her sibling,” he said.
  
  Ashlee Pittenger, Unroe’s sister, passed 
away on April 5, 2007 at age 24. 
Four years later, Unroe, a redshirt fresh-
man, still is not comfortable publicly discuss-ing the details of her sister’s death. 
  Lingenfelter could empathize. As a young 
boy , he had lost his older brother, a topic he admits is easiest to discuss with others who have been in his situation. 
  “If you’ve never been there, it’s a mute con-
versation,” he said. “If you have been there, 
it’s a fraternity that probably bears sharing.”
  The emotional attachment created what 
Lingenfelter called “an instant connectivity .” 
For him, looking at Unroe was like looking in a mirror: an everyday observation of a player who was equal parts maddening, frustrating and rewarding to coach. He argued with her more than he did with any other player, often getting smart-alec remarks in return. 
  For Lingenfelter, his role transformed from 
monitoring her decisions to becoming a good friend.
  “We were both hard-headed, stubborn, 
rude sometimes,” Unroe said. “I can’t even describe how much of a bond we formed be-cause it’s so deep.”
  It was a relationship often defying polite 
and respectful norms. Even in the darkest mo-ments and during the most meaningful con-versations, Lingenfelter and Unroe pulled no punches.
  “Life is life,” Lingenfelter would say. “Some 
of it’s magic, and some of it’s tragic. You’ve just got to roll with that. You’ve got to ﬁ  gure it out.”
  
  
  One week after the death of her sister, Un-
roe was faced with a dilemma. 
  In Baltimore lied an opportunity to play in 
front of some of the country’s most elite col-leges at a club tournament. At home in Muncie was Shelby and Kyle — a grieving mother and a heartbroken sister.
  Unroe went against her initial thoughts 
and elected to play, traveling with a team-mate’s family and performing at a level she called “terrible.”
  “I was crying half the time,” she said. “I 
wasn’t myself.”
  Still, her performance warranted the atten-
tion of then-UF assistant coach Ryan Theis. After ﬁ  lming Taylor, he showed the video to Wise, who attended a Samurai practice to see her and set up a visit. 
  “It was something good that came from 
something that was so terrible,” Unroe said. “I was worried that I wasn’t even going to get 
recruited by a college.”
  
    Unroe and her mother expected a few but-
terﬂ  ies at the rainforest exhibit. They were 
overwhelmed when they came across thou-sands. 
  When they ﬁ  rst walked in, one large but-
terﬂ  y landed on Unroe’s shoulder. Ashlee im-mediately came to mind. It was another day full of tears. 
  Unroe wept while admiring the scenery , 
then again while explaining its signiﬁ  cance to Wise and then-associate head coach Nick Cheronis.
  Shelby had made her daughter wait to 
commit until after she had visited Florida, but 
now there was no hesitation.
  “My mom and I didn’t even need to talk 
about it,” Unroe said. “We both agreed that 
this was the right place for me after that, spe-ciﬁ  cally.”
  At 15, she was a Gator.
  
  
  Her decision would not be the end of her 
troubles. 
  As a senior at Burris High, Unroe fractured 
and sprained her ankle. She elected to play 
through it, winning an Indiana high school state championship and playing for a national runner-up club team. 
  “Typical of Taylor Unroe, she wasn’t going 
to sit out,” Lingenfelter said. “Had we known 
what the ramiﬁ  cations were, we probably 
wouldn’t have played her.”
  Unroe’s ankle was damaged to a point that required surgery and a redshirt to start her Florida career. Instead of the opportunity to contribute as a freshman last season, she was forced to watch practice from folding chairs in the Lemerand Center. 
Part of a two-deep recruiting class, Un-
roe was isolated from sharing her experience with anyone on the team, as fellow freshman Chanel Brown earned honors as an SEC All-
Freshman Team selection.
  A 15-hour drive from home, Unroe was of-
ten alone and depressed. 
  “It was the worst time of my life,” she 
said. “I had plenty of meltdowns and plenty 
of breakdowns and crying calls to my mom, plenty of stuff like that.”
  When talking to Lingenfelter, Unroe al-
ways promised a resurgence the following 
year. Slowly, he began to notice a new matu-rity in their weekly phone calls. Unroe was do-
ing well in school and adjusting to Gainesville. For the ﬁ  rst time, she was able to separate vol-
leyball from life. 
  “She’s a beautiful kid,” he said. “I think she 
started realizing that for the ﬁ  rst time.”

  Fast-forward to the present and Unroe’s 
name is announced loud with the lights out before every game at the O’Connell Center.
She wants to be remembered as more than 
a success in Muncie, something that drives her to be the best libero she can be for the Gators.
  Her troubles are in the past, but they are 
constantly remembered.
  “Nothing in your life is ever going to be 
perfect, but when it’s close to it or if it’s going really well, you think of all those times where you didn’t think it was ever going to be good,” 
she said. “It just kind of opens your eyes.”  TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 22, 2011  ALLIGATOR, 15

Redshirt freshman Taylor Unroe went through a rough patch in her life after the death 
of her sister, Ashlee, in 2007. Now a libero for the Gators, Unroe still uses the memory of Ashlee as motivation to pursue her goals.

Unroe overcomes tragedy, injury to start at UF16, ALLIGATOR §  TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 22, 2011
outside. 
Guard Kenny Boynton, who hit 6 
of 9 threes against Wright State on 
Monday, said he stills fears that UF 
could have the occasional off night. But, with so many bona fide shoot-ing threats, it’s hard to believe the 
whole roster could go cold at once. 
And, if it does, Boynton said the Gators can overcome that through rebounding.  
And here’s the thing: Donovan can’t expect Florida to be something it’s not. 
Say you want a nice, shiny new 
car. You know the make that has been good to you in the past and just want to pick up the latest model. 
Then, somebody turns around 
and buys you a private jet. 
Just because you wanted a car, 
you’re not going to simply drive your shiny new jet around. You have got to take it out and let it fly, 
man. 
Donovan wanted to build a car, but between junior guard Mike Ro-
sario’s transfer and the recruitment of freshman guard Brad Beal to a 
roster that already had three qual-
ity options in the backcourt, he has built himself a jet. 
If that jet isn’t built to fly to New 
Orleans — the site of this year’s Fi-nal Four — then that’s just the way it is. All we can say for sure is that trying to drive it there won’t make the trip any easier.

Wenger, McCray to return against FSU
expects the Gators to be near full strength against the Semi-
noles on Saturday.
Offensive lineman Dan Wenger (ankle) and linebacker 
Lerentee McCray (shoulder) are expected to return to prac-tice today. Tight end Jordan Reed, who suffered an ankle in-
jury midway through the Furman game, is expected back by 
Wednesday.
Left tackle Xavier Nixon, who was “banged up” against 
the Paladins, and running back Chris Rainey (ankle) should play against the Seminoles on Senior Day this Saturday in The Swamp.Redshirt senior quarterback John Brantley also said he’s 
“really close to 100 percent” after suffering an ankle injury against Alabama on Oct. 1. 
“I’ve felt really healthy for a long time now, a couple of 
weeks, and I just keep seeing progress get better,” Brantley said.
Sturgis honored: Kicker Caleb Sturgis was named one of 
three finalists for the Lou Groza Award, given to the nation’s top kicker.
Sturgis has made 21 of 25 field goal attempts this season, 
including three of 50 yards or longer, and he is tied for second in the nation for made field goals

missing in the paint. By the 11:37 mark, the Gators were already in the bonus, putting their 56.9 free-
throw percentage to the test.
After only having nine prior attempts at the line, 
Beal helped quiet some of Florida’s 
free-throw frustrations by going a 
game-high 9 for 11 from the line. 
As a team, the Gators went 20 
for 30 and scored 10 of their last 14 
points off free throws in the final six minutes.
“Brad was the one guy I thought, 
he was 1 for 6 from the 3-point line, 
but you would have really never noticed it with the way that he was playing because he had some drives 
to the basket,” Donovan said. “He got to the free-
throw line.”
