UF President Bernie Machen addresses reporters Monday after Gov. 
Rick Scott signed the state budget. The budget restored the $300 million that was cut from universities last year.

Due to an outstanding 
debt of almost $30,000, 
delivery of both The New York Times and USA Today to the UF campus has been suspended.
The readership program, 
which provides free digital and physical copies of both papers to students, is a partnership between the two companies. USA Today handles the contracting and billing to the school as well as distribution of the paper. 
According to a USA Today 
representative who preferred to remain anonymous, Student Government and USA Today signed a service agreement that called for $66,590 for the 2012-13 school year. 
SG submitted a purchase 
order for $40,000. 
“We get a call from 
USA Today within the last month saying, ‘You’ve got to cancel all the papers at UF because they’re not going to pay their bill,’” said Kevin Cappallo, national director of education sales for The New York Times. “There’s an outstanding balance of, I’m thinking, 20-something-thousand.”
But UF Student Body 
President Christina Bonarrigo said she was not aware of a vote to reduce the allocation.
“I am aware that a 
purchase agreement was made for a certain amount of money and that UF honored that agreement,” she said.
She said the contract, 
signed in 2010, featured a clause that said funds were “subject to availability.”
“We went through the 
proper avenues of the program that was requested,” Bonarrigo said. “It was passed through the senate body and the Budget and Appropriations Committee.”
The USA Today 
representative said a conference call was scheduled in an attempt to work with SG, but the students were a “no-show.”
Similarly, Cappallo said 
he’s had trouble reaching SG.New York Times and 
USA Today no longer available on campus� GOV. SCOTT VETOED A 
TUITION HIKE.

For the ﬁ  rst time in six years, 
UF programs won’t be cut as a re-
sult of the state’s budget.
On Monday, Florida Gov. Rick 
Scott signed the $74.1 billion Fam-ilies First budget, which restores $300 million cut from universities last year. Scott also vetoed $368 million in projects — including a 3 percent undergraduate tuition increase.
“We have money to invest in 
new initiatives,” UF President Bernie Machen said in a Q-and-A session with local media Mon-day. “We really have a pretty much balanced budget, so we’re not looking for cuts, we’re look-ing for reinvestments.”
The budget appropriates 
roughly $616 million to UF. That breaks down into about $329 million for education and gen-eral projects, $107 million for the Health Science Center, $141 mil-lion for IFAS and about $39 mil-lion in construction and mainte-nance funds.
“I think the Legislature and 
the governor are in a situation where our state’s economy has rebounded,” he said. “They could have invested in a whole bunch of things, but the majority of the new funding that is coming into our state is going to education —  higher education and K-12 education.”
Machen speciﬁ  cally mentioned 
the preeminence proposal, which will provide $15 million a year to be matched by UF for increasing faculty resources.
“All of that, I think, if we do 
it strategically, will help us move forward in the national rank-ings,” Machen said.
He added students can ex-
pect faculty members who feel

College students eat more fruits and veg-
etables and exercise more on days when they 
talk to their parents, according to a recent Pennsylvania State University study.
Parents form and share healthy habits 
with their children before they enter college, said Sarah Schmidt, a dietetic intern at UF’s Student Health Care Center. “Parents have a role in coaching their chil-
dren and are still support for them,” Schmidt said. 
College students were 14 percent more 
likely to eat fruits and vegetables on days when they talked with their parents. Also, students were 50 percent more likely to ex-ercise for at least 30 minutes, according to the study.
Soo Ha, a 19-year-old applied physiology 
and kinesiology junior, said she doesn’t eat much because of her busy schedule. Some-times, she’s so busy that she forgets to eat. But when her mom texts her throughout the day, it reminds her, she said. 
Ha said college students live inconvenient 
lifestyles.
“In college, putting time for the gym is 
the ﬁ  rst thing to cut out — especially when you’re busy,” she said.
Researchers didn’t document the conver-
sation content between students and their parents, so the study doesn’t explain why the conversations had positive effects on stu-dents’ habits.
Kemia Harris, a 20-year-old telecommu-
nication senior, said she disagrees with the study’s results.
“I talked to [my mom] this morning, and 
I’m eating Chick-ﬁ  l-A,” she said. “Unless she cooks healthy, I don’t eat healthy. When my parents stress me out, I tend to eat un-healthy.”
Parental phone chats lead to healthier eating and activitySEE BERNIE, PAGE 4
“It’d be a shame for 
[the program] to end. I 
know it’s been heavily 
used by the students.”

Small city anxious to learn jackpot 
winner 
ZEPHYRHILLS — It could be 
an anxious wait of up to two months for people in a small Florida city to find out who won the highest Powerball jackpot in history: an estimated $590.5 million.The lucky ticket was bought sometime Saturday or ear-lier at a Publix supermarket in going, ‘uh, did you win the lot-tery?’” Sandra Lewis said. “No, I didn’t win, guys. Sorry.”Sara Jeltis said her parents in Michigan texted her with the news Sunday morning.“Well, it didn’t click until I came here,” she said, gesturing to the half-dozen TV live trucks humming in the Publix parking lot. “And I’m like, ‘Wow I can’t believe it, it’s shocking!’ Out of the whole country, this Publix, in little Zephyrhills would be the winner.”With four out of every five pos-sible combinations of Powerball numbers in play, lottery execu-tives said Saturday that some-one was almost certain to win the game’s highest jackpot, a windfall of hundreds of mil-lions of dollars — and that’s after taxes.The winning numbers were 10, 13, 14, 22 and 52, with a Powerball of 11.Estimates had earlier put the jackpot at around $600 million. But Powerball’s online site said Sunday that the jackpot had reached an estimated $590.5 million.The world’s largest jackpot was a $656 million Mega Millions jackpot in March 2012.Terry Rich, CEO of the Iowa Lottery, initially confirmed that one Florida winning ticket had been sold. He told The Associated Press that follow-ing the Florida winner, the Powerball grand prize was be-ing reset at an estimated jack-pot of $40 million, or about $25.1 million cash value.The chances of winning the prize were astronomically low: 1 in 175.2 million. That’s how many different ways you can combine the numbers when you play. But lottery officials estimated that about 80 percent of those possible combinations had been purchased recently.The longshot odds didn’t de-ter people across Powerball-playing states — 43 plus Washington, D.C., and the U.S. Virgin Islands — from lining up at gas stations and conve-nience stores Saturday.Lewis, who went to the Publix on Sunday to buy water, said she didn’t play — and she isn’t upset about it.“Life goes on,” she said, shrug-ging. “I’m good.”
— THE ASSOCIATED PRESSZephyrhills, a city of about 13,000 people best known around the state for its brand of spring water with the same name.The winner has 60 days to claim the lump-sum cash option, estimated around $376.9 million, at the Florida Lottery’s office in Tallahassee. Under Florida law, lottery winners in the state cannot re-main anonymous; their names and city of residence must be made publicly available to anyone who asks, according to the state’s lottery website. No one had come forward as of Monday morning.“It never happens this quick-ly,” lottery spokesman David Bishop said. “If they know they won, they’re going to contact their attorney or an accountant first so they can get their affairs in order.”The winner wasn’t Matthew Bogel. On Sunday, he loaded groceries into his car after shopping at the Publix. He shook his head when asked about the jackpot.“It’s crazy, isn’t it?” he said. “That’s so much money.”It’s an amount too high for many to imagine. Compare it to the budget for the city of Zephyrhills: This year’s fig-ure is just more than $49 mil-lion. The winning Powerball jackpot is 12 times that.Publix spokeswoman Maria Brous said there are a lot of rumors about who won, but the store doesn’t know. “We’re excited for the winner or winners,” she said.Plenty of people in Zephyrhills are wondering whether it’s someone they know.Joan Albertson drove to the Publix early Sunday morning with her camera in hand, in case the winner emerged. She said she bought a ticket at a store across the street, and the idea of winning that much money was still something of a shock.“Oh, there’s so much good that you could do with that amount of money.” Albertson said. “I don’t even know where to begin.”Zephyrhills is a small city in Pasco County, about 30 miles northeast of downtown Tampa. Once a rural farming town, it’s now known as a hotbed for skydiving activity, and the home to large retiree mobile home parks and the water bottled from the natu-ral springs that surround the area.And now, one lucky lottery ticket.“I’m getting text messages and messages from Facebook

NEWBERRY — The sound of a 
machete chopping watermelons mixed with the melodies of popular country songs. Little girls strutted across the field new pink and green dresses, and festival-goers wore a glisten of of sweat and juice on their faces.  
Watermelon was everywhere. The 68th Newberry Watermelon 
Festival was held Saturday in a field about 10 miles north of the Oaks Mall on State Road 26.
Volunteers sliced and distributed 
free watermelon wedges into par-ticipants’ juice-covered hands.
“I think it’s a good combo — the 
weather and the watermelon,” said 20-year-old chemical engineering senior Jee Hye Kang, who attended the festival with a group from the UF Chinese American Student As-sociation.
The festival is one of the old-
est running small-town festivals in America, said Kathi Thomas, the president of the festival. Her fam-ily has been involved with the event since it began, she said.
Newberry’s economy relies on 
its agricultural production, Thomas said. The festival’s purpose is to cel-ebrate the agricultural roots of the community as well as its current farmers.
“It’s a celebration saying ‘Hey, 
we’re still here,’” she said. “Agricul-ture still sustains this community.”
Jordan Marlowe, a Newberry 
city commissioner, also emphasized the importance of agricultural pro-duction to the Newberry communi-ty. He said watermelon has always been a staple crop for the city.
“If everyone is doing well in wa-
termelon season, then everybody is generally happy,” he said. “If it’s a poor crop, we all share in the sorrow together.”
A farm in Arcadia, Fla., donated 
the watermelons, said Kateara Ston-er, a festival volunteer.
Newberry’s watermelon crops 
weren’t ready yet.
Eating watermelon wasn’t the 
only activity at the festival. Partici-pants also entered hog-calling, seed-spitting and watermelon-rolling contests.
A pageant contributed to the fes-
tivities as well.
Seven women competed for 
the title of Newberry Watermelon Queen to represent the local farm-ing population as well as the city of Newberry throughout the coming year.
Brandi Harrison, who won the 
festival title in 2009 and is this year’s state watermelon queen, said the fes-tival queen fills an important role.
“I don’t consider the Newberry 
pageant a pageant,” she said. “I con-sider it as a spokesperson for my hometown.”
On Friday and Saturday, the 
contestants were evaluated for their performance in seven categories: in-terview, speech, evening wear, casu-al wear, overall impression, beauty and onstage questions.
On Saturday afternoon, Kyndal 
VanAernam, an 18-year-old Dixie County High School senior, was called on stage and crowned the 2013 Newberry Watermelon Queen.
“It’s exciting that they think 
highly enough of me to give me that position,” she said. “I’m...hoping I make everyone happy and repre-sent the community well in the wa-termelon industry.”
Marlowe said the Newberry Wa-
termelon Queens traditionally rep-resent the city well.
“She puts a good face of Newber-
ry on for us,” he said. “We embrace the watermelon culture.”TUESDAY, MAY 21, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 3

Fred Armstrong, 58, chomps into a slice of watermelon during the Newberry Watermelon Festival on 
Saturday. The festival is famous for giving out free, unlimited slices of watermelon to attendees. 
Newberry Watermelon Festival continues juicy traditionLOCAL“I have made several overtures 
to contact the president of SGA,” 
he said. “I’ve tried contacting the adviser of SGA and haven’t gotten any response.”
However, Bonarrigo said 
she talked to the USA Today representative twice last week. 
“We discussed options 
about the program,” she said. “[The representative] hoped we would continue the program for the upcoming years, and it’s something the Senate would discuss in the upcoming year’s budget.”
According to the 
representative, USA Today had been trying to get in contact with SG since the beginning of the year.It was only until recently 
that they communicated with Bonarrigo — after she had been contacted by the Alligator for information. 
“[SG] didn’t say, ‘You’re 
spending too much of our money.’ The red flag never went up…then we would have dug further,” the representative said. “But instead, nobody got that message to the USA Today Orlando local office.”
As a result of the reduced 
purchasing order, both papers will be forced to write off the debt, but for now will not be sending the university’s account to collections, which could show negligent activity and lower the university’s credit score, according to the representative. 
“It’d be a shame for [the 
program] to end,” said Patrick Reakes, Chairman of Library West. “I know it’s been heavily used by the students.”
Brittany Birsner, a 20-year-
old telecommunication junior, also noticed the program’s  popularity.
“If I go to get a newspaper,” 
she said, “The New York Times is the first to go. By the time I get  to them, they’re all gone.”
While USA Today believes 
that the university should be liable for the papers used, it still wishes to continue the program and provide The New York Times and USA Today.
“USA Today is willing to work 
with UF Student Government and the university to renegotiate a new contract for the fall,” the representative said. “We are open to discussions with all interested parties.”4, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, MAY 21, 2013

In Florida, dogs may not be man’s best friend.
According to a 2012 State Farm insurance report pub-
lished by the American Veterinary Medical Association, the state ranked the eighth highest in total number of dog bite insurance claims. 
The release of the report coincides with National Dog Bite 
Prevention Week, which began Sunday and is dedicated to educating the public about safe human-dog interaction.
Floridians filed 123 insurance claims related to dog bites, 
according to the report. 
Paul Myers, administrator of the Alachua County Health 
Department, said that every year, about 500 Floridians are hospitalized and two are killed due to dog bites.
Because many Florida activities revolve around the out-
doors, he said, there are more opportunities for interactions with dogs, leading to more bites.
Children are the most vulnerable to attacks, he said, which 
is an important concern as summer break approaches and more children are outside.
Hailey Dunn, a UF biology sophomore who works as a 
veterinary technician in Gainesville, said she has been bitten by dogs multiple times on the job.
She said her worst experience happened in high school 
when a German shepherd, Jade, bit her leg while at a groom-ing salon.
She said the incident made her more mindful.“I just watch the animals I’m around a little bit more close-
ly,” she said.Fido: friend or foe?Newspapers report communication issues

Machen seems optimistic
rewarded after years of no raises. 
Graduate teaching assistants will see increased compensation as well, the details of which Machen said will be negotiated with Grad-uate Assistants United.
About $15 million will go to-
ward the construction of a new 
chemistry building. That amount is not enough to complete the project, Machen said, but “it’s a good step forward.”
Despite his words of warning 
that the state is still fragile and 
recovering, Machen was positive about the budget.
“This is Florida,” he said. “If 
any state has a great future, it’s us.”

UF officials announced Monday that the 
hospital system UF&Shands was renamed 
UF Health.
The change is a product of research and 
development by the hospital and has been in the works for several months, said Me-lissa Blouin, director of news and publica-tions for UF Health. 
She also said that while the hospital sys-
tem tried to make as many changes as pos-
sible in time for the announcement, it will likely take several more months until all of the signage and logos are updated.“We don’t want people to have to throw 
away their current stuff,” Blouin said.
The hospital name familiar to most peo-
ple — Shands — is here to stay.
However, the hospital itself will now be 
UF Health Shands Hospital, according to 
the release.
“There is a family legacy in Gainesville, 
and the name [Shands] is not going away,” Blouin said.
Shands Jacksonville, a separate private 
hospital, will be changing to UF Health Jacksonville, and ShandsCair, the emer-gency transport service at UF, will keep its current name. 
All of the health-focused colleges at UF 
will also retain their current names with the exception of the cancer center, which will become the UF Health Cancer Center, ac-cording to the press release.

As customers casually shopped for 
toothpaste at CVS/pharmacy on Friday 
evening, the store became the grounds for a feminist flash mob when nearly 60 people marched in objection to the Obama administration’s appeal on the federal court’s decision to put the morn-ing-after pill over the counter with no restrictions.
Members of Gainesville Women’s 
Liberation and other local residents chanted, placed two real packages and several makeshift boxes of Plan B One-Step on the shelves next to condoms and listened to spokeswoman Stephanie Seguin explain the action. 
“The idea is to send a message to the 
Obama administration to stop the appeal of the lawsuit and let Judge Korman’s ruling stand,” Seguin said. “If they’re not going to put the morning-after pill over the counter, then we’re going to do it ourselves.” 
The Gainesville Women’s Liberation 
has been working for a decade to over-turn the morning-after pill restrictions. The 2005 case Tummino v. Hamburg fought the Food and Drug Administra-tion and Department of Health and Hu-man Services’ decision to restrict access to emergency contraception.
On April 5, U.S. District Court Judge 
Edward Korman ordered that it be made available to women and girls “without a prescription and without point-of-sale or age restrictions within 30 days,” accord-ing to a news release by the Partnership for Civil Justice Fund.
Instead of complying with the court’s 
order, the government announced April 30 that women and girls were still ex-pected to present government-issued ID in order to obtain the pill, preventing over-the-counter access, according to the release. Korman denied the Obama ad-ministration’s motion to stay his order. 
“We’re trying to build momentum 
around the country to build the femi-nist movement to pressure the Obama administration,” National Women’s Lib-eration founder Candi Churchill said. “But it’s really not about CVS — it’s just a place to do it.” 
This event was part of the week of ac-
tion led by the New York and Gainesville chapters of the National Women’s Lib-eration. Others like it occurred in cities such as New York City, Chicago and Washington, D.C.
Churchill explained that the action 
was meant to be quick but dramatic.
“We’re trying to make the point that 
they’re keeping this perfectly safe form of birth control from us for no legitimate reason,” she said. “They’re treating this drug in a sexist way compared to con-doms and other forms of medicine and health that people need.”
Less than 10 minutes after entering 
the pharmacy on Friday, the group of protesters left peacefully — just as em-ployees began calling the police.
“I can’t believe we’re still fighting 
for this,” Seguin said. “Maybe now [the Obama administration] will be more likely to listen to us. This is something women want.”

The black bear that’s been wan-
dering south Gainesville since last 
week — first spotted in the Kirk-wood subdivision — is on the prowl. 
So far the bear hasn’t posed an 
immediate danger to anyone, but it will probably stick around the area, said Officer Ben Tobias, spokesman for Gainesville Police.
“He’s probably not going to be 
going anywhere, since that’s the place he found a bite to eat,” Tobias said.
On Thursday morning, the bear 
knocked down a bird feeder, val-ued at about $100, in Betty Jean Schelske’s yard in the 2000 block of Southwest Ninth Drive, according to a GPD incident report. 
Although she did not see it hap-
pen, Schelske, 77, said in the report that the bear must have jumped over her fence to get in. 
GPD is coordinating with the 
Florida Fish and Wildlife Conserva-tion Commission, Tobias said, and the agency will take responsibility once it can pinpoint the animal.“It’s basically going to be their 
show whenever we can get him in a particular area,” he said.
During the weekend, the FWC 
received a few bear sighting reports, said Karen Parker, an FWC regional public information coordinator. 
An FWC officer and a biologist 
tried to hunt for the bear during the weekend, she said, but it evaded them each time. 
“Every time they showed up, the 
bear had moved on,” she said.
The team planned to haze the 
bear with a “bean bag shot from shotgun,” she said, “to let him know being around humans is very un-comfortable.”
At one point 
during the week-end, Parker said, the biologist went to the north area of Paynes Prairie in response to a sighting report.
When the biologist arrived, a re-
port came in that indicated the bear had moved to the south of Paynes Prairie. As soon as the biologist reached that area, a report said the bear was back in the north area.
For now, Parker said, the FWC 
will continue to track reports.“We did want him to go back to

The sightings made a splash on 
Twitter as residents posted jokes about it using the hashtags #Gaines-villeBear and #yogi. Tweets from the handle @GainesvilleBea1 began to appear Thursday. One read, “Yes I poop in the woods.”
“I’m happy he’s created a Twit-

OPINIONS EDITORToday’s question: Has your bike ever been stolen?
Vote or post a message at www.alligator.orgResults from Thursday’s poll were not available due 
to technical difficulties.Since the birth of feminism, it seems its ideology has 
been engaged in a more-than-happy marriage with radically left, anti-capitalist ideology and has enjoyed 
being bedfellows with the state. The repetitive cries of femi-nists who call for women to fight patriarchy while they join the struggle to escape the position of male dependency be-comes void, at best, once you examine their means to their ends. The only system in which women can be truly counted as equals in society is laissez-faire capitalism.
Feminism has a deeply rooted history with socialism, 
Marxism and left anarchism. The penumbras of these schools of thought permeated feminist ideology and rhetoric greatly during the 1960s, just as they do today. For example, the group Radical Women, founded in 1967 by hardline commu-nist Gloria Martin and the Freedom Socialist Party founder Clara Fraser, claimed that the plight of the female gender can be attributed to “the capitalist form of production and distri-bution of products, characterized by intrinsic class, race, sex, ethnic and caste oppression.” No statement can be further from the truth. Legislation such as the Paycheck Fairness Act calls for close to or equal pay between men and women, and although this may intuitively seem to help the progress of women, the effects of such legislative acts actually disem-power women in the workforce.
This legislation’s initial premise, assuming that the state 
can determine the cost of labor and expropriate private prop-erty to benefit a special interest group (in this case the special interest group being women), has proven harmful time and time again. Any good confiscated by the state from group A to benefit group B is harmful because any action that may have been taken by group A is now thwarted in favor of group B via market distortions.
To further this point empirically rather than philosophi-
cally, if an employer is sexist and denies women work, his discrimination can now avoid the difference between the lower female competitive wage because a woman’s ability to offer a competitive wage is now nonexistent due to wage laws. In the absence of such legisla-tion, a worker can offer to work at a lower rate of pay and force a racist or sexist employer to hire her despite the 
employer’s bigotry. And in the case that an employer still hires a man instead of a woman, despite her offering of a competitive wage, that employer now bears a cost due to his discriminatory hiring process — weakening that business’ competitive edge. A clean and free market would thwart dis-criminatory hiring on its own.
Capitalism and free markets are not only capable of fight-
ing gender bias in the U.S., but have also brought women greater economic justice worldwide. Take Saudi Arabia for example.
Women in many parts of Saudi Arabia are banned from 
showing themselves in public without covering their whole bodies, with the exception of their eyes, hands and feet. Women are also prohibited from driving cars and doing busi-ness outside of the home. This discrimination is an attempt to exclude women from economic activity. Two-thirds of In-ternet users in Saudi Arabia are women, running businesses from home and becoming less dependent on their husbands, according to a book published in 2003 by the Cato Institute. Thus, women in Saudi Arabia have found economic libera-tion via the free market and technological advancement. 
Many feminists in the U.S. stand firmly behind President 
Barack Obama as a champion of women’s rights but are run-ning afoul in doing so because Obama repeatedly kills wom-en in drone strikes in countries where women are already downtrodden. 
Capitalism has raised the standards of living unilaterally, 
and that, of course, includes women. If feminists are serious about fighting for equality for women, they should abandon state dependency and embrace laissez-faire capitalism.
T. Emmett Ryan is a political science sophomore at Santa Fe 
College. His columns appear Tuesdays. Monsant-NO:
GMOs do more 
bad than good
Earlier this year, Congress passed the Agricultural Appro-
priations Bill for 2013 and the Farmer Assurance Provi-sion. This provision was slipped into the larger bill and 
passed unbeknown to many of the members of Congress. It protects producers of genetically modified organisms from any harm in court, regardless of health risks associated with them. 
The legislation has come to be known as the Monsanto Pro-
tection Act. The act makes it so the genetically modified organ-isms’ giant, Monsanto, can sell seeds irrespective of any health risks associated with them as courts can’t cease the sale of the crops. As if that isn’t scary enough, Monsanto helped write it.
At long last, there is an effort to repeal the egregious act. Jeff 
Merkley, of Oregon, is introducing an amendment to the Con-solidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2013 in hopes of repealing the Monsanto Protection Act, but will he be successful? While the original bill was in the House, congress-man Jon Tester attempted to amend the language from the bill but failed. Merkley’s repeal effort comes on the eve of a Mon-santo victory in the Supreme Court.
Earlier this month, the Supreme Court heard a case between 
Monsanto and a 75-year-old farmer who had planted genetically modified Monsanto beans outside of patent restrictions. Some are worried that the case will have future implications for the sale of vaccines and other products using living, replicating or-ganisms. 
This month, Monsanto CEO Hugh Grant told Bloomberg that 
he sees elitism being fueled through social media with regard to criticisms of his company. 
“Most of the people that become motivated to engage the po-
litical issues have become convinced that going down the road of genetically engineered foods is not the way to meet the needs of a food insecure population,” he said in a Bloomberg article. 
But one can hardly help but be suspicious of all of this rhetoric 
being spouted on top of the passage of the Monsanto Protection Act. While it may be true that humans of the globe are in need of new and innovative farming techniques in order to meet food demands, shouldn’t the companies offering new techniques be responsible if their crops yield poison rather than food?
And with Monsanto’s $1.48 billion in profits announced ear-
lier this year, one should be all the more suspicious. 
Is it a sin to make a lot of money? Probably not. Is it a sin to 
experiment with new techniques when human health is on the line? Definitely not. The sin is in using money and influence to change the rules. The sin is in making it so that nobody is held responsible when there’s prior knowledge of potential damage to human health.
Remember the Ford Pinto? Ford was grilled with lawsuits 
and bad press for having weighed profits against the welfare of consumers who would be unaware of the car’s safety hazards. Imagine now, though, that Ford had been protected from any legal repercussions despite not informing consumers of the dan-gers involved with driving the car because a bill had been qui-etly slipped through Congress. 
It sounds weird to us, too.

As students at UF, we 
understand how im-portant it is to have a 
resume that showcases our talents and abilities. Almost every job we apply for is high-ly competitive, so we need to make ourselves stand out. Despite that, some of us have experience that will never be on our resumes.
These skills that we develop 
can come from odd places. For example, the administrator of a Facebook fan page dedicated to a character in a video game learns public relations while dealing with fans. One of the largest pages in this category is about “Metagross,” a Poké-mon species. That page has more than 36,000 fans. Other pages for games with a small-er fan base — such as games from the Fire Emblem series — have more than 3,000 fans.
By and large, though, I 
don’t think most people would list “Facebook Page Admin” as part of their job experience. They may have learned things and grown as a person because of them, but there seems to be a stigma about listing the job.
Personally, I also have this 
problem. I am a global mod-erator on a forum in which members role play a text-based Pokémon adventure in a fan-designed and fan-updat-ed world. In addition to the re-sponsibilities that go with that — we only have four global mods — I also publish the site’s newsletter, which has in-game event information and is also used to advertise the site via Tumblr and sometimes Twitter.
As a result of my time on 
this site, I have learned and improved a multitude of skills. I work with computer graph-ics, juggle the recruiting of site vol-unteers and im-p r o v e m y d e b a t e s k i l l s through discus-
sion with other players. I’ve learned how to act profes-sionally while monitoring the site and enforcing rules, fuel creativity while introducing new quests for players and en-hance my own public relations skills when creating prizes for members. All of this while at-tending class, working on as-signments and writing for the Alligator.
Despite learning and grow-
ing from all of this, I am not about to list “Global Modera-tor at Pokémon site” on my resume. I think part of it is that despite having to be ex-tremely professional in that world, when it comes to the “real world,” it does not have that professional air about it.
I have to believe that I am 
not the only one who has en-countered this situation. I would argue that these invis-ible experiences make us more rounded and valuable indi-viduals and potential employ-ees than someone who has similar experience and grades but has never ventured farther into the Internet than social media.
I may not inform a potential 
employer that I spend most of my free time working for a fan website, but I know the things I have learned will make me a better worker, even if it has nothing to do with the job I am seeking.

Just kidding. Time for correction No. 1 of the sum-
mer.
Much like some of the rowdier folks at political 
events I’ve covered have foretold, I may one day call 
you fellow traveler. I think it’s highly unlikely — I group quite a few of my friends by the patriotic or American song that ﬁ  ts them best — “Fortunate Son” tops the list for me — but I can’t rule out change. Which brings me to 
the longest segue I’ve ever written: on change.
The times, they are a-changin’. Now that we’ve 
passed the initial hiccups of a new staff and the ﬁ  rst papers of the summer, I’d like to lay out some of the changes for you consumers-of-news out there. Many are internal or deal with ofﬁ  ce politics (and one huge one that isn’t ready for primetime yet), and I won’t bother listing those. But some are big projects that I want to put out into the universe.
Think of this as a “Whose Line Is It Anyway” score-
card for those of you keeping track at home — except now the points do matter.
First is breaking news. Be-
cause this is a new-ish venture for the way our newsroom 
works, I can’t say with any certainty good results will happen soon — especially in the doldrums of summer news — but rest assured, we’re working on improve-ments. News art is another point I want to touch on. I was thrilled to see maps being done in-house this Spring to go with stories, but it’s not enough. Look for more as the semester rolls on. More Web interactives, too.
Sadly, we have ﬂ  oundered on social media and video 
in the past: some semesters were great, others lackluster. Again, I’m working with our online and photo folks to ramp up both of these. But I’ll cut it off here.
Thanks for continuing to read the Alligator. I’m 
proud of the work we do for each and every issue, and know it when I sit down and cut stories to ﬁ  t the page, and I can’t ﬁ  nd any weak parts to get rid of.
Have a great summer, y’all. I know I will.I’m a communist — kidding, the editorColumn

Kathy Holmes, a representative of Bayer HealthCare, shares information about cancer with passers-
by who trekked through a 10- by 30- foot inflatable, walk-through colon in front of the Hilton UF Con -
ference Center on Southwest 34th Street. The colon, which shows the progression of colon cancer as it goes from the early stages to the worst stages of the disease, was brought as part of the 2013 Women’s Advantage annual health fair, which emphasized colon cancer. It also gave participants free screenings for things such as bone health, glucose, cholesterol, thyroid, vision, mental and emotional health, and a wide range of other pro-health tests.

A Gainesville man was 
arrested Sunday night after 
a police officer spotted him tugging on the tire of a locked bicycle. 
Ronald Eugene Griffis, 56, 
was arrested Sunday evening on charges of second-degree loitering and prowling.
Justin Nelson, a witness, 
told officers he saw Griffis walking near his apartment complex on Northwest Ninth Terrace approaching patios to look at bikes and glancing into vehicles.
Later, Gainesville Police 
Officer Warren Meek walked toward Griffis, 56, in front of Bank of America at 1116 W. University Ave. 
According to the report, 
Meek saw Griffis kneeling next to a gray Jamis Boss Cruiser bicycle locked to the rack in front of the building, tugging on the rear wheel, ac-cording to the arrest report. 
When Meek asked Griffis 
what he was doing, Griffis said he was looking for a wheel to replace a damaged wheel on his own bicycle, which he said was hit by a vehicle earlier that evening.
Then, Griffis said the bike 
was not his and apologized, according to the report. He took out a pair of channel lock pliers from his backpack and began to reattach the wheel to the bicycle. 
Griffis was arrested and 
taken to the Alachua County Jail at about 9 p.m. Sunday. As of press time, he remained there with a $3,000 bond.

After more than two years of 
local and national advocacy, the 
Gainesville Loves Mountains orga-nization has taken the next step in an attempt to end Gainesville Re-gional Utilities’ purchase of moun-taintop-removal coal.
The organization proposed 
an ordinance to the Gainesville City Commission this month that would prohibit GRU from buying coal mined from mountaintops. Commissioner Thomas Hawkins is sponsoring the ordinance.
The purpose of mountaintop-
removal coal, which uses less man-power to take resources from the tops of mountains only, is to cut jobs, said Jason Fults, co-founder of Gainesville Loves Mountains.
“It’s so they can replace miners 
with heavy equipment and explo-sives,” he said. “It’s a labor-saving device.”
GRU representatives could not 
be reached for comment. 
Fults said other effects on moun-tain communities can include ex-plosions and contaminated water.
“The companies are going 
to these gorgeous Appalachian Mountains that are thousands of years old and a legacy for this country and literally digging them up,” Hawkins said.  “Cultures are built up around these areas, and it’s a negative consequence.”
Alhough Fults said GRU previ-
ously stated it would prefer to not use mountaintop coal, Gainesville Loves Mountains is focused on obtaining a document prohibiting the purchase and use altogether, he said.“It’s their preference, but it’s not 
a strong preference,” he said about 
GRU. “If they need to hear it from the Gainesville City Commission, then that’s the route we have to take.”
Now that an ordinance has been 
proposed and an online petition has more than 390 signatures, Fults said he is confident Gainesville could be a model for other communities. 
The issue sat idle in the City Commission for the past two years, 
Fults said, and recently, drafting the ordinance took longer than expect-ed. He said the organization hoped to pitch it to the city commission before the Spring semester ended because more students would be in town to lend support.  
For now, Hawkins said, a deci-
sion is pending local support from the public. 
“It’s not a final decision yet,” 
Hawkins said. “Making that deci-sion permanent would be the com-munity saying, ‘We don’t want to use the electricity from this source anymore.’”
Local group wants GRU to stop buying mountaintop-removal coal
“It’s a labor-saving 
device.”

  JOSH JURNOVOY
 Alligator Staff Writer
 
  There weren’t any controversial stick checks. 
There was no double overtime. 
  But there was an end of an era.
  For the second consecutive year, Syracuse (18-
3) ended Florida’s (18-3) season, as the Gators lost 13-9 on Saturday in the Carrier Dome in the NCAA Tournament quarterﬁ  nals.
  It was the ﬁ  nal time the 13 Gators seniors took 
the ﬁ  eld— 10 of whom had been with the team for the entirety of the program’s four-year existence and committed to UF before the school even had a ﬁ  eld to play on.
  “This is obviously a disappointing way to end 
their career,” coach Amanda O’Leary said. “But at the same time, we’ve got to be so proud of what they’ve accomplished and what they brought to the university.”
  Last season, Syracuse erased a 12-5 second-
half Florida lead to force overtime in the NCAA semiﬁ  nals in Stony Brook, N.Y. 
The Gators looked to have won the game on 
a free-position shot from attacker Gabi Wiegand in the ﬁ  nal seconds of the ﬁ  rst overtime. But the goal was called back after the Orange called a stick check and her stick pocket was ruled illegal. After winning the opening draw of the second overtime, Syracuse scored on the ﬁ  rst possession to advance to the championship.
  On Saturday, the Orange controlled the ball 
for the ﬁ  rst four minutes and jumped out to a 2-0 lead. The Gators scored their way back into the game for remainder of ﬁ  rst half as seniors Kitty Cullen and Gabi Wiegand and sophomore Nora Barry notched goals to take the lead,. The defense did not allow a goal for an 18-minute stretch.  
  Freshman midﬁ  elder Kelly Cross broke Syra-
cuse’s scoring drought at the 8:34 mark of the ﬁ  rst half, and both teams scored once more to make it 4-4 at halftime. 
  However, that was as close as the game would 
get. Orange freshman and All-American Kayla Treanor scored 53 seconds into the second half to give Syracuse the lead for good.
  Although the class 
of 2013 Gators did not advance to the Final Four as they did during 
their junior season, O’Leary said Saturday’s loss couldn’t tarnish the importance of their four years in Gainesville.
  “What will stick out to me is how these young 
women represented the University of Florida, and they are classy young women,” O’Leary said. 
“They represented us in the best possible 
manner and will always hold a special place in my heart and everyone associated with Florida lacrosse; because they put us on the map.”

Poll Question:
Who will be Florida baseball’s most valuable player 
in the postseason?ADAM LICHTENSTEIN

Down by a run in the top of the fourth in Satur-
day’s rubber game against Georgia, Florida had a 
chance to start a two-out rally. 
Designated hitter Brady Roberson singled, and 
shortstop Cody Dent – batting .165 on the season – drew a walk to put runners on first and second for the top of the Gators’ lineup.
Freshman Richie Martin worked a 3-2 count 
from Georgia hurler Jared Walsh before ground-ing out to second base to end the inning.
One batter later, Bulldogs center fielder Justin 
Bryan hit a leadoff home run to start the bottom of the fourth. Georgia scored twice in the inning and didn’t look back, winning 9-2 to take the series.
“We’ve been fighting like heck to get a big hit,” 
coach Kevin O’Sullivan said. 
After Georgia added two runs in the fourth, 
Florida had another chance with two outs and runners in scoring position in the fifth inning on Saturday. The Gators failed for the second frame in a row. 
Right fielder Justin Shafer singled, and first 
baseman Vickash Ramjit followed with a base hit. But despite being ahead in the count 2-0, left field-er Harrison Bader fouled out to left field.“We had some opportunities there in the fifth 
to kind of crawl back into it,” O’Sullivan said. “Unfortunately, we weren’t able to come up with a big hit.”
Eighth-seeded Florida (29-27, 
14-16 Southeastern Conference) will look to improve on its situ-ational hitting when it faces No. 9 seed Texas A&M (30-25, 13-16 SEC) tonight in Hoover, Ala., at 5:30 p.m.
“The postseason is a brand 
new season,” O’Sullivan said. “It’s a clean slate.”
Closer to make third start: After Florida’s loss 
to Georgia on Saturday, O’Sullivan announced that sophomore Johnny Magliozzi would get the start against Texas A&M on Tuesday.
Magliozzi’s last start came against Auburn on 
May 11. The right-hander gave up three runs in seven innings.
“(We’ll) throw our best guy out there,” 
O’Sullivan said. “It’s a one-game play in type of thing, so we’re going to give it our best shot.”

Despite recording only one hit 
against USF, Florida found a way to 
march on to the Super Regionals.
The No. 2 seed Gators (55-7) 
drew four walks and a hit-by-pitch to plate two runs in the fourth as they defeated the Bulls (45-16) 2-0 on Sunday at Katie Seashole Pressly Stadium to win the Gainesville Re-gional.
“I honestly thought, ‘Man, if we 
get no-hit, this is the first time I can ever remember winning a game when you get no hits,’” coach Tim Walton said. 
UF will host UAB in the 
Gainesville Super Regional on Saturday and Sunday. Alabama-Birmingham defeated UCLA in walk-off fashion 3-2 on Sunday in a 13-inning game to win the Louisville Regional. 
Sunday’s matchup was a duel 
between aces. Junior right-hander Hannah Rogers and USF pitcher Sara Nevins retired a combined 18 of 19 batters during their first three innings.
In the fourth, freshman Kirsti 
Merritt drew a free pass and moved to second after junior Stephanie Tofft dropped down a sacrifice bunt. Nevins then intentionally walked sophomore Lauren Haeger, who knocked a three-run homer during Florida’s 11-1 victory against USF on Saturday.
After Nevins threw a wild pitch 
past catcher Lee Ann Spivey – ad-vancing Merritt and Haeger a base – senior Kelsey Horton drew a walk to load the bases.
Freshman Taylor Schwarz 
walked in the next at-bat, scoring Merritt for the 1-0 lead. Then, Nev-ins hit freshman Taylore Fuller with a pitch to increase Florida’s advan-tage to two runs with two outs. 
In a complete game Sunday af-
ternoon, Rogers allowed three hits, struck out five batters and did not walk any batters. The Bulls never advanced past second base.
“Hannah and I had a conversa-
tion in the dugout [Saturday] about her being able to throw the ball a little more through the zone,” Wal-ton said.
“I felt like she was trying to miss 
bats [Saturday], more so than she was [Sunday]. She was coming out and really throwing the ball – I don’t want to say harder – but it had a little more late break to it.”
Added Rogers: “You just have 
to go out there and keep competing because if you get down for one sec-ond, it’s only a two-run game and they could come back at any mo-ment.”
After lasting only 1.1 innings 
against Florida on Saturday, Nevins pitched 5.2 hitless frames but was subbed out for Lindsey Richardson for the remainder of the sixth. Nev-ins returned for the seventh and allowed her only hit of the day to freshman Kelsey Stewart, who sin-gled to left field.
The Gators advance to Super Re-
gionals for the first time since 2011. USF eliminated  fifth-seeded Florida in last year’s Gainesville Regional.

History shows that when Florida 
and Stanford meet, Stanford wins.
History repeated itself on Mon-
day.
The 12th-ranked Cardinal upset 
the No. 1 Gators 4-3 in an intense 
match on Monday.
Florida tied up the match at 3 af-
ter junior Olivia Janowicz edged out Ellen Tsay 6-4 in the third set.
Then it came down to Alex Cer-
cone.
Cercone was in a constant battle 
against Krista Hardeback in the sec-ond set, tying at 5-5, then 6-6 to force a 10-point tiebreak. 
Hardeback started out strong 
and grabbed the first two points. Cercone came back, but lost her mo-mentum as Hardeback won 7-6 to force a third set.
Hardeback worked Cercone 
all over the court, making her run while holding serve advantage and contesting every high ball Cercone hit her way.
The two were at a 3-3 tie as Hard-eback hit the net to give Cercone the game point. However, it didn’t take long for the Cardinal to break Cercone down with hard hits to the backcourt and corners. 
Once Hardeback got into a 
rhythm, Cercone couldn’t make up the difference and lost 3-6 to end Florida’s chance at a third consecu-tive national title.
Cercone had previously won her 
singles match against Hardeback, 4-6, 6-4, 6-3, on Feb.  24 at the Ring Tennis Complex. 
Cercone wasn’t the only Gator 
to struggle in Monday’s semifinal matchup.
Top-ranked Lauren Embree lost 
a lopsided singles match to No. 13 Nicole Gibbs. 
Gibbs overpowered Embree to 
win 6-0, 6-1.
Sofie Oyen also crumbled in her 
singles match. The junior trailed Kristie Ahn in the first set, losing it 1-6. 
Oyen tried to come back with 
some looks in the second, pressuring Ahn on the sides, but dropped the fi-nal two games to give Ahn a 6-4 win and up Stanford’s lead to 3-0.
However, freshman Brianna 
Morgan came out ready for the competition, facing Stacey Tan for the second time this season. Morgan defeated Tan in the regular season, and Morgan repeated her success with a 6-1, 6-3 win.
Morgan gave Florida its first 
point of the match.
Senior Caroline Hitimana provid-
ed the second point for the Gators, coming back from a 1-6 loss in the first set to dominate Ellen Tsay 6-1, 6-0 in fast second and third sets.
Stanford got an early lead on 
Florida in doubles, which gave the Cardinal the momentum.
After four consecutive doubles 
wins in the NCAA Tournament, the Gators fell behind on two courts to drop the point.
The 11th-ranked pairing of Em-
bree and Oyen tried to keep up against the eighth-ranked Stanford duo of Ahn and Gibbs, but Embree and Oyen took the 3-8 loss.
Cercone and Hitimana followed 
suit, losing 3-8 to Tan and Tsay.
The Cardinal now leads the 
Gators 10-3 in NCAA Tournaments and 18-13 in the all-time series.
Stanford will face Texas A&M in 
the NCAA title match today at 6. Florida falls short of three-peat

THE RALLY
  
 The Florida baseball team could have played 
itself into being an NCAA Tournament lock with a strong ﬁ  nish to its season. In-
stead, the Gators lost seven of those 12 games, including two of three to unranked Auburn and Georgia. Today, alligatorSports baseball writers Josh Jurnovoy and Adam Lichtenstein debate what will give Florida more trouble in this week’s Southeastern Conference tournament: hitting or pitching.
  Josh: Both the lineup and pitching staff 
have signiﬁ  cantly underachieved for the Gators this season. However, the bats have been absolutely dormant lately. Meanwhile, the arms have shown signs of rounding into form. In the ﬁ  nal series of the regular sea-son, Florida got two strong starts from right-hander Jonathon Crawford and left-hander Bobby Poyner. Offensively, the team only mustered seven runs in three games against the staff with the leagues second-worst ERA at 4.61. 
The potential is clearly there for the 
pitching staff to be a strength for this team, but the ﬂ  ashes just haven’t been there at the plate.
  Adam: Crawford and Poyner turned in 
those starts against the cellar-dwelling Bull-dogs – not exactly a selling point.
  The last time Crawford faced a team with 
a record above .500, he got rocked for four runs in four innings. Crawford has a world of talent, but he has not been close to the ace Florida needed him to be this season.
  Poyner has not been the model of consis-
tency, either. He has made it into the sixth inning four times as a starter. Two of those games were against Florida Atlantic and Florida Gulf Coast. I know the Gators have had trouble with the Eagles this season, but come on, Gulf Coast plays in the Atlantic Sun Conference.
  The other two outings were against Geor-
gia and Tennessee – the worst teams in the SEC East. Neither team will be in Hoover, Ala., with Florida this week.
  The Gators have talented bats that are 
due to turn things around. The pitching, however, has been inconsistent all season.
  Josh: Although this last weekend wasn’t 
the best litmus test for how Florida will perform against better teams in postseason play, it’s the most recent sample, and the pitch-ers were better. They’ve also turned in qual-ity outings this season against better lineups than Georgia’s. Poyner might not be a workhorse, but he turned in four strong innings in Tallahassee against then-No. 7 FSU and held FGCU — a team that had swept Florida earlier in the season — to one run in 5.1 innings. Crawford has thrown a shutout against Ole Miss and has a qual-ity outing against then-No. 8 South Carolina under his belt.
 Also, Johnny Magliozzi, who has been 
dominant against both good and bad teams, is moving to the rotation this week. Mean-while, the offense has scored more than ﬁ  ve runs just six times since the beginning of April (I’m not counting the 22-run outburst against 6-42 Florida A&M on May 6).
  One of the tal-
ented bats you’re counting on to ﬁ  gure things out is catcher Taylor Gushue. He went 0 for 12 against Geor-gia, which isn’t something that can 
be easily dismissed. Gushue is supposed to be the team’s best power hitter, and a stretch like that isn’t one you want to be in as the postseason approaches.
Adam:  Gushue slumped against Geor-
gia, but he’s only one of Florida’s several talented bats. Justin Shafer went 4 for 11 in Athens. Vickash Ramjit went 5 for 11. Har-rison Bader went 4 for 8.
  If one or two players don’t hit, it’s a prob-
lem, but it’s not fatal to the Gators’ chances. If the pitching struggles, Florida won’t be playing much longer.
  It’s simple baseball. If the Gators’ pitch-ers shut out the opposition, the offense only needs to score one run. If the pitchers col-lapse, the offense needs to step up that much more.
  Magliozzi will give the Gators a boost in 
the rotation, and he may carry them past the Aggies, but Kevin O’Sullivan is robbing Pe-ter to pay Paul. Sully clearly would prefer him in the pen – that’s why he’s only started him twice all season. Magliozzi is a decent starter, but he’s a great closer.
  In his limited time as a starter, he’s given 
up six earned runs in 12.2 innings. That’s good, not great. 
That’s nearly as many runs as he gave up 
in 44 innings of relief. Now that’s domina-tion.
  Starting Magliozzi shows just how des-
perate O’Sullivan is for good pitching. 
  Josh: Magliozzi has been Florida’s best 
reliever all season, but moving him to the rotation will lessen the burden on those re-maining in the bullpen. Even though his ERA isn’t great as a starter, he hasn’t been chased early in those outings. His seven-inning per-formance last time out against Auburn is the longest start for any UF pitcher this season besides Crawford’s one shutout. 
  The point that the offense only needs to 
score one run if the pitchers throw shutouts is a valid one. But based on what we’ve seen, the more likely scenario is that the pitchers will be solid and not allow more than a few runs, and the bats will struggle to be aver-age.
  Adam: The problem is that the kind of 
“solid” we’ve seen from Florida pitchers is not going to cut it in the postseason. Four or ﬁ  ve innings of three-run ball just isn’t good enough. 
  Crawford doesn’t need to repeat his no-
hit performance from last year’s NCAA Tournament, but he needs to be somewhere in the vicinity. Magliozzi needs to con-tinue his performance against better teams than Auburn. If Florida advances, it needs Poyner, Eric Hanhold or somebody to step up and deliver quality pitching. The offense will perform, but it can’t bail out its starters like last season.
