Date rape drugs were 
slipped into the drinks of at 
least three women at Grog House, wrote the president of a UF club that networks interna-
tional and domestic students.                                                                
NaviGators International 
President Heather Lear sent 
an e-mail to club members Wednesday, warning them to watch for date rape drugs at lo-cal bars.                                                                                  
“Several of our internation-
al girls have had their drinks drugged at Grog on more than one occasion, and I wanted to make everyone aware of this 
trend,” Lear wrote.                                                                      
The first incident was in Jan-
uary, followed by another on 
Feb. 4, said Jessica Bode, Navi-Gators vice president.                                                   
In the February incident, 
two women in NaviGators shared a vodka-mixed drink and then showed signs of date rape drugging, Bode said while waiting for friends to show up at  Grog Wednesday night.
One of the women woke 
up at Shands and could not remember how she got there, 
Bode said.                                                                                
Nick Roller, a Grog security 
guard, said that drugging is 
uncommon in Gainesville bars. He hears of a case about every six months, he said.

Candidates running on the executive ticket 
showcased their platform ideas during a debate 
Sunday night in front of about 200 students, as the Feb. 24 and 25 Student Government elec-tions loom closer.
They answered questions for nearly two 
hours in the Reitz Union Grand Ballroom for the Freshman Leadership Council’s fourth an-nual SG debate. 
Representatives from all four political par-
ties running were present — the Keg Party, 
the Orange and Blue Party, the Progress Party 
and the Unite Party. But two-thirds of the Keg Party’s executive ticket was absent, including vice presidential candidate Russ Ward and treasurer candidate Elizabeth Stinson.
Jordan Johnson, presidential candidate for 
the Unite Party, said he was pleased with the student turnout, adding that there was room for improvement.
“It looked that about 75 percent had party T-shirts on,” he said. 
The debate served as a venue for candidates 
to share their party’s platform and personal view on sustainability, textbook pricing, free printing and online voting. 
“We pride ourselves in being the party that 
has supported online voting, getting the nearly 6,000 signatures to have it on the ballot,” said Orange and Blue Party presidential candidate 
Mark McShera. 
One party took a lighter approach when 
speaking on the issues.
“I dream of the day I can engage in student 
government the only way someone should 
engage in student government,” said Frank Walch, presidential candidate of the Keg Party. SG candidates debate issues
n MAURER WAS ONE OF 49 WHO 
DIED IN THURSDAY’S CRASH.

UF alumna Lorin Maurer was one of 49 
who died aboard Continental Connection 
Flight 3407 when it crashed into a home near Buffalo, N.Y., Thursday night.
A man inside the home was also killed and his wife and child were injured, accord-ing to news reports.
Officials said “significant icing” of the 
plane’s windshield and wings could have played a part in the crash.
Maurer earned a master’s degree in sports 
management from UF in 2002, according to the Daily Princetonian. She attended Row-an University in 2001, earning a degree in health and exercise science.
At the time of her death, she was a fund-
raiser for the athletics department at Prince-ton University. She was flying to Buffalo for her boyfriend’s brother’s wedding.
Friends described her as an outgoing 
sports nut and a huge Gator fan.
She attended the last two UF basketball 
championships and was in Miami in January 
when UF beat Oklahoma for the BCS National Champion-ship, according to friends.
She would also watch the 
Gators play on TV whenever she could, said Robert Allen, her roommate and co-worker 
at Princeton.
Allen, who graduated from UF in 1997 with a degree in economics, said Maurer 
was very athletic.
“She ran every morning — in the ice, in 
the snow — you name it, she would always get out there and run,” he said. “She was very disciplined.”
Bobby Darnell, who met her in 2003 
when they were in the same NCAA intern-ship program, said Maurer made friends with everyone.
“It was like she never met a stranger,” 
he said. “We would go all kinds of differ- Friends remember UF alumna who died in plane crash

Chavez wins vote to scrap term limits in Venezuela
CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — President Hugo 
Chavez won a referendum to eliminate term limits Sun-
day, paving the way for him to run again in 2012 — and beyond — and push through his vision of a socialist Ven-ezuela.
With 94 percent of the vote counted, 54 percent voted 
in favor of the constitutional amendment, National Elec-toral Council chief Tibisay Lucena announced.
Forty-six percent had voted against the measure to 
eliminate term limits on all public officials, too few to make up the distance with the remaining votes.“You don’t stop a cock fight by add -
ing more cocks to the fight.”

UF ACADEMICS
By KRISTEN HUFF
Alligator Contributing Writer
When St. Thomas Aquinas se-
nior Lauren Sharifi couldn’t see if 
she had been accepted to UF on Fri-day because the online system was jammed, she, like many others, re-
sorted to Facebook. 
“Everyone’s status was like ‘Hey, 
I got in!’ or ‘Ah, it’s not working!’” 
said Sharifi, 18. 
According to UF spokesman 
Steve Orlando, this is often the case on the day the university in-forms prospective students online if they’ve been accepted.
“Ultimately 7,000 people are go-
ing to slam that system at 6 p.m.,” Orlando said. 
Sharifi was able to access the sys-
tem the next day and was happy to 
learn she had been accepted. 
“It was kind of weird because I 
wasn’t really expecting to get in,” 
she said. 
UF received about 27,850 appli-
cants by the November deadline, but students can still apply by March 1, according to Orlando. Those who apply by the sec-
ond deadline will be informed of their application status in April. 
Because all 
applications have 
not yet been re-
ceived, Orlando said, it’s safe to 
say UF will surpass the 28,000 total applications it received last year. 
Orlando attributed the increase 
in applicants to the state of the econ-omy. Many prospective students who would have looked out of state decided to stay in Florida, he said. 
As of Friday, the official num-
ber of potential students accepted was not released, but Orlando said it won’t be much different from last year’s 10,600 acceptances. 
The Office of Admissions doesn’t 
release that information until a few days after acceptances have been posted because they’re subject to change right up until 6 p.m., Orlan-do said. The target size of the fresh-man class is 6,400 students. 
Orlando said the quality of this year’s freshman class will be even better than last year’s, but specific data on this year’s applicants has not been released yet. 
The average weighted GPA of 
last year’s freshman class was 4.1 and the average SAT score was 1276, 
Orlando said.  Acceptance letters 
will be mailed sometime this week. 
Sharifi was visiting friends in 
Gainesville this weekend when she learned of her acceptance.
 “I could have either been cel-
ebrating or like ‘I hate this place,’” 
she said.
� MORE THAN 20 ANIMALS WERE 
ADPOTED AT THE EVENT.
By EMILY FUGGETTA
Alligator Writer
While most people looked for a properly 
waxed date on Feb. 14, others found a valen-
tine with a little extra fur.
More than 20 people found cuddly com-
panions on Saturday at  the Alachua County Animal Services “Come Fall in Love” event.
The organization offered reduced adoption 
fees, including vaccinations and spaying or neutering. People paid less than half the shel-
ter’s regular rates for dogs and cats.
Visitors had free coffee, spaghetti and 
donuts as they toured the pink-and-red-bal-looned shelter and met eligible dogs, cats, rab-
bits and hamsters.
Trey Regar, 4, may have been a little too 
young for a Valentine’s Day date, but he found the perfect companion — one that doesn’t mind getting dirty and never gets tired of 
chasing a ball — when he met Ranger, a young 
pit bull mix.
“He needed a boy’s dog, and this is a boy’s 
dog,” Trey’s father, Ron Regar, said of Rang-er.                        “I didn’t want to get him a little sissy dog.”
According to Regar, the family searched 
for the perfect dog since Trey’s Rottweiler 
died several weeks before, and they thought 
Ranger was the perfect match.
“They just clicked the second they met 
over at the cage,” he said. “Trey said, ‘This is the one 
I want.’”
ACAS spokeswoman 
Hilary Hynes said the connection between Trey and Ranger was exactly what the events are designed to create.
“We watch for the moment when [the 
adopter] is holding the animal in their arms and you can just tell it’s right,” she said. 
“We’re in the business of permanent happy 
endings,” she said.
Hynes said that the shelter usually has 
about 16 adoptions per week, but events like the one Saturday often result in the placement of about seven times that many. 
Saturday was no exception.“When we opened at 9:30, we had people 
running to the front door,” she said.
Hynes attributed the event’s success to the 
low adoption fees and to the good spirits peo-ple tend to be in on holidays.
“It’s Valentine’s Day,” she said. “It’s a rea-
son to come fall in love.”Prospective UF students learn of application status

� THE $1M WILL BE USED 
FOR GRADUATE STUDENTS.
By CHELSEA KEENAN                                       
Alligator Writer         
Despite recent cuts to UF’s bud-
get, some programs will continue to  
flourish.
Thanks to a $1 million grant from 
the National Science Foundation, 
some UF graduate students will 
have new opportunities to prepare for future careers. Though the money has not been 
divvied out for specific purposes, it will likely be used to arrange work-
shops, guest lectures and intern-
ships for graduate students who are studying science, engineering, tech-nology and mathematics. 
Emory University has a similar 
program, so Patricia Marsteller, the director of the Emory College Cen-ter for Science Education, visited the Reitz Union on Friday to speak 
with students and faculty about the 
grant’s possibilities.
She said students should have 
more opportunities to develop skills they can use in the workplace.
“There’s not any formal pro-
gramming on how to apply for jobs, 
networking or teaching,” she said, 
adding that the grant has the poten-tial to provide all of these things.
Many graduate 
students feel un-aware of what to do or where to go 
once done with school, she said.        
One function of the grant will be 
to help graduate students learn the fundamentals of communication in the form of workshops and mentor programs with professors.Learning to write grants, nego-
tiate starting salaries or prepare re-search statements will help students 
gain further funding.
The grant will also allow students 
from the different departments re-
c e i v i n g  t h e  m o n e y  t o  w o r k  t o g e t h e r .                                                                    
This can be a challenge though, 
Marsteller said, because different departments have different needs.
“You have to get where you can 
sit down and create partnerships 
that are win-win for both (depart-
ments),” she said.
Marsteller went on to offer advice 
for when the time comes to divvy up the money.
“Plan strategically,” she said. 
“When the money goes, so will the 
institution’s commitment. Ask the 
grad students what they’re not get-ting. “ She said that leadership may lose interest in the program once the funding is gone.
Marsteller said although UF has 
the money in hand, the hard part will be deciding where the money will go.
“Remember,” she said. “(The 
process is) hard and it’s slow. You have to figure out ways to make this work.” Grant gives opportunities to UF graduate students

UF President Bernie Ma-
chen got some pre-Valen-
tine’s Day love Friday morn-ing from a student group seeking to recognize him for 
his environmental efforts at 
UF.
UF’s chapter of Florida 
PIRG, short for Public Inter-est Research Group, present-ed Machen with a “Green Valentine” in the President’s Conference Room in Tigert Hall.
The group advocates 
change on issues including the environment, higher edu-cation and homelessness.
Five of the 30 or so mem-
bers in the group gave Ma-chen the card, signed by hun-dreds of UF students, and asked him to be their eco-
friendly valentine, to which 
he replied, “It would be my honor.”“Thanks for what you’re 
doing,” he said to the group. “It’s your world and it’s our world and, unfortunately, my generation has made it 
a problem 
for your world, and 
maybe to-
gether we can fix it,” he said.
He said 
his envi-ronmental 
efforts are largely the prod-uct of student demand.
“I was going to get run 
over by the students if I didn’t do something,” he said.
But he said budget cuts 
will make it difficult for UF to maintain its commitment to sustainability.
He also noted that his wife 
has been looking into buying 
an electric scooter.

After 15 years on West Univer-

ter packed up its books and moved 
into a bigger space more than a mile away.
The move to 433 S. Main St. be-
gan Tuesday and continued until 
Saturday. Regular hours will re-
sume today.
A grand reopening ceremony will take place Saturday with a rib-bon-cutting at 4 p.m. and an open 
house from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. 
The biggest reason for chang-
ing locations was rent, said Jimmy Schmidt, co-coordinator of the CMC.
“It just keeps going up and up,” 
Schmidt said. 
Money wasn’t the only reason 
for the move, he said. The CMC 
started to outgrow its University Avenue location.
“I put a lot of my life into this or-
ganization and a lot has happened 
here,” Schmidt said. “On the other 
hand, I’m so excited about the new chapter and moving forward.” 
� THE MAN WAS UNDER INVESTIGATION 
FOR PROVIDING A FALSE ADDRESS.
A registered sex offender was arrested Friday in 
connection with Tuesday’s bank robbery of Campus USA Credit Union.
Clinton Ponce, 27, was under investigation during 
the time of the robbery for giving authorities a faulty address after moving to Alachua County. Registered sex offenders must notify officials within 48 hours of an address change.
When the still photo of the bank robbery came out, 
Gainesville Police Department investigators Jim McCo-llum and Courtnay Roberts recognized Ponce from pri-or investigations, said GPD spokesman Keith Kameg.Ponce was arrested at the Alachua County Public 
Library at about 2:30 p.m. when police got a tip that he 
was in the area.
After interviews with GPD and 
the FBI, Ponce admitted to the bank 
robbery.
He had been released from prison 
Feb. 7 after a 2001 child pornography conviction, Kameg said.
“In six days of Ponce’s relevant 
freedom, he committed two felo-
nies,” Kameg said.
Ponce was charged with failing to register his ad-
dress as a registered sex offender and bank robbery.

SG online voting has dirty little secret Babies having babies
Word across the pond 
reveals news of a 13-year-old who 
became a father after his girl-friend gave birth last Mon-
day.
According to British tab-
loid The Sun, Alfie Patten 
and Chantelle Steadman (a cougar-like 15-year-old), conceived a baby girl after engaging in one night of un-protected sex.
Looks like the young Brits 
were sleeping during sex ed.
Patten may be 13, but a 
quick Google search reveals the portrait of a child a good decade away from his first shave.
The latest on the situation 
has other young men coming out of the woodwork to claim 
that they, not Patten, are the 
true father of the baby.
While the Editorial Board 
can’t help but be impressed by the young man’s pre-sumed sexual prowess, we do harbor some concern for the baby’s well-being.
Not only does the couple 
lack jobs, the Steadman fam-ily’s current financial situa-
tion includes living off the 
country’s equivalent of wel-fare – hardly the ideal situ-ation considering the many needs of a newborn.
It’s great that Patten 
seems to have embraced the responsibility that comes along with being a new dad, 
but how does he expect to 
provide diapers, formula and clothes for his baby girl?
Let’s be honest, a newly 
minted teenager has no busi-ness rearing a child. His skill-set is much better suited for, oh say, eating junk food and watching television.
But seriously, will he even 
graduate from high school before his daughter’s first day of kindergarten?
At least they can always 
share toys.For many UF students, the words “police officer” con-
jures imagery of underage alcohol violations and tick-ets for jaywalking.
Until you meet Gainesville police officer Joey Devore — 
single-handedly making his life’s mission to keep you alive with more than 100 DUI arrests in the past year.
Not exactly a cop you would mind sharing a doughnut 
with.
Interestingly enough, Devore didn’t end up as the depart-
ment’s designated DUI enforcer by choice, but rather due to the fact that his vehicle was equipped with a camera.
Utilizing the technology and understanding the impor-
tance of his role, Devore’s efforts have not gone unnoticed as Mothers Against Drunk Driving has acknowledged him for his top-notch work.
According to a Gainesville Sun article, Devore will be rec-
ognized for his achievements at the annual Florida MADD banquet this spring, along with other officers from across the state.
The Editorial Board salutes Officer Devore for his out-
standing contributions to the Gainesville community. 
Too often we are guilty of taking the work of law enforce-
ment for granted and failing to honor their laudable efforts.
Through Devore’s dedication to making the roads safer 
for North Central Florida, he kept countless innocent people 
from succumbing to an early death at the hands of an irre-
sponsible driver.
We can only hope that all officers strive to follow the ex-
ceptional example set by Devore.
In 2007, UF students Tommy Jardon and Sam Miorelli, both current leaders of the Orange and Blue Party, started to renew efforts to make online voting the 
norm for Student Government elections.
Their organization, Students for Online Voting 
(SOLVe), needed to collect signatures of at least 10 per-cent of the entire student body, which they did.
Then, according to the student constitution, they were 
“guaranteed the right to submit initiatives and referen-dums for ratification by the electorate.” Specifically, the proposed amendment for online voting had to pass ap-proval by 60 percent of the UF electorate.
Yet, we’re not voting online because SOLVe hit a snag 
right before the referendum was placed on the spring 2008 ballot to be voted on by the students. The UF Su-preme Court decided to review the constitutionality of the 
proposed amendment. Guess what? Turns out voting on-
line, or voting any place outside of the privacy of a voting booth is, gasp, illegal.
I was shocked, too. To think that my last absentee bal-
lot was suddenly unconstitutional made me sick to my 
stomach. The UF Supreme Court’s lone and courageous 
dissenter, Justice John Campbell, argued that the court lacked the authority to even review the constitutionality of the referendum, and then for kicks went on to inform 
his judicial colleagues that online voting had been ap-
proved for national presidential primaries. 
Campbell’s dissent wasn’t enough. Jardon and Mi-
orelli’s last hope was appealing to the vice president of Student Affairs’ office.
A committee was promised to look into the issue, and 
was eventually delegated to what became a partisan group of SG members. Needless to say, the committee wasn’t in-credibly productive.
So, Jardon and Miorelli sued. 
They sued the UF administra-
tion, they sued SG and they sued 
the UF Supreme Court. If a fake court wouldn’t follow the laws of logic and even legal precedence, 
then hopefully a real one could.
What’s wrong with online 
voting? According to its dissent-
ers, first it was unsecure, prone to Internet hackers.
Next, online voting would supposedly lead to voter 
coercion. But online voting, if ever allowed, would be ac-
cessed through a secure and encrypted server by use of a voter’s Gator ID and password, the same process we trust for our grades and planning our course schedule. Privacy 
wise, Georgetown, Penn State, Duke, FSU and a host of 
other universities have not had privacy infringement is-sues.
They’ve just seen higher voter turnout.That’s what’s wrong with online voting. If ever al-
lowed, it would expand the electorate, making elections inherently more fair. Dissenters to online voting don’t want to challenge the status quo. They, the Gator Party or its newest quasi-iteration, the Unite Party, want to 
win. They need the “I-Voted” stickers; they need bands 
of easy-to-please pledges collecting those stickers, gently reminding people who to vote for. They need a small elec-torate. They need your apathy.
They get it; they just don’t want you to. That’s how you 
win an election.

Letters to the Editor
Ads fuel body insecurities
I would like to follow up on the 
letter about the Gainesville Health 
and Fitness ad from last week. The at-tention that has been brought to this issue could not come at a better time. 
In one week, UF will join other 
universities, communities and indi-viduals across the country to raise awareness of the dangers of eating disorders during National Eating Disorders Awareness Week 2009.  
According to the National Eating 
Disorders Association, approximate-ly 10 million women and 1 million 
men are engaged in a life-and-death 
battle every day with an eating dis-order. These are serious illnesses, not “choices” whose causes are multidi-mensional and complex. 
Ads like the one run by Gainesville 
Health and Fitness feed into the in-securities of both women and men. They portray unrealistic standards 
that are impossible to achieve.  But 
they do more than that, these types of ads trick us into believing that when we have a body like the one they show, we will be happy. 
Regardless of the product being 
sold, the perfect body is equated with absolute happiness. But I can tell you, as I am sure the young woman who 
wrote the original letter last week 
can attest, that no matter how much weight we lose, happiness does not come with a number attached.
We have cultivated a society 
that places an incredible amount of importance on physical beauty and thinness. Consequently, we see people starving themselves and us-
ing compulsive measures to rid their 
bodies of nourishment in their search for “the perfect body.” This vicious cycle leads to feelings of inadequacy, worthlessness and isolation that are difficult to escape.
I commend the young woman 
who has taken a stance against the images and ideals we are confronted 
with on a daily basis. 
She eloquently illustrated how ads 
like these can contribute to the devel-
opment of eating disorders, body image issues and disordered eating problems.  The good news is that we do have the power to change things. We have the power to stand up to the media, to corporations, to our friends 
and to our families and say enough is 
enough. 
The beauty of being human is that 
everyone is unique. We come in a va-riety of shapes, sizes and colors. 
It’s time to celebrate the qualities 
that make us unique, rejoice in our diversity and find the beauty in each of us.

Hygiene not cause of virus
An article appeared in your publi-
cation recently detailing the outbreak of the norovirus in our house that I felt warranted a response.
First of all, if you have ever been 
to our house the first thing you will notice is how beautiful and immacu-late it is. Our staff takes great pride in their work, from our housekeeper to the chefs in our kitchen.
Our housekeeper has worked on 
this campus for over 17 years and is very meticulous in her work. The bathrooms are cleaned daily with 
bleach and she often scrubs the cor-
ners and floors with a toothbrush. You can smell the cleanliness throughout our house.
Our kitchen is inspected on a 
quarterly basis by the Alachua Coun-ty Health Department, and has al-ways received an excellent review. I would challenge anyone to question 
the way that our kitchen is run from 
the delivery, preparation and serving of our food. We have two chefs that are absolutely the very best and are constantly aware of making sure that their kitchen is clean and no contami-nation occurs. 
Due to their meticulous preventa-
tive measures, the spread of the no-
rovirus was in no way related to the 
preparation of our food. 
Your article stated that the kitchen 
was given a “total cleandown.” Once again I would like to say that we have one of the cleanest kitchens on campus and it receives a total “clean-down” every evening before the staff goes home.
You mentioned in your article 
that the virus could have come from food brought into the house. All food, besides fresh fruits and vegetables (which are washed before they are served), delivered to our house arrives in either vacuum-sealed packages or in boxes that have been sealed. 
The outside vendors we use de-
liver to almost every single Gator Dining facility as well as other Greek houses here on campus. Food is not delivered or brought into our kitchen from any other sources.
The norovirus that hit our house 
could have been contracted any-where. It is passed from person-to-person contact. We have many guests 
that eat at our house on a daily basis. 
This virus could have been intro-
duced into our house by any of these 
visitors and then passed along very quickly to our sisters.
Due to the quick response and co-
operation of our membership, as well as our community, the virus was con-tained and did not spread.

DUI punishment more than fair
UF students who are academically 
sanctioned for driving under the in-fluence are generally only suspended for one semester, a slap on the wrist when put into perspective. 
When my car was hit head on by 
a  UF student driving with a blood alcohol content level of .156, or twice the legal alcohol limit, I was the only one incapable of going to school the next day. Not only did this one single invasive act put me in a coma for 11 days, it took me out of school for a year, and left my friends and family in the Shands ER waiting room where they were prohibited from seeing me because my mother did not want 
them to witness what I looked like 
when machines were breathing and consuming food for me.
So when does a public school have 
the right to judge someone’s actions outside of school?
When those actions put the pub-
lic, sometimes their own students, at risk.  You may pay to go to school 
here right now, but I will forever pay 
a price for another student’s decision to drink and drive. 
With this in mind, please pay your 
own tab and designate a driver.
Nicole Martingano
4LSPeople have forgotten how to talk to each other. 
Instead, we argue. We mumble and avoid 
eye contact, leaving out the most human parts of communication. 
Communication happens among people. It is a 
give and take. Two different perspectives have the glorious opportunity to cross paths and learn from each other. 
If the ability to speak separates us from lower 
species, why do we disregard our blessing like the crinkly, burnt French fry at the bottom of the Fry-pod? 
We don’t converse. We talk at and over each 
other. There is no listening, and there’s zero com-promise. Hollow small talk and battles for correct-ness prevail. 
You ask anyone how they’re doing and they go 
straight to their internal answering machines. They mutter “good” or something equivalent in a tone as humdrum as the Rev. Lovejoy from “The Simp-sons.” 
We don’t need to exchange “E! True Hollywood 
Stories,” but a little enthusiasm never hurt anyone. I know everyone has crappy days — even Mary 
Poppins gets the flu — but there has to be some 
middle ground between robotic responses and un-necessary traumatic anecdotes.  
When we aren’t piling useless fillers into our 
spare time, we may actually engage someone on a subject we care about. Unfortunately, discussions among different points of view often turn ugly. 
Someone disagrees with us, and we become ra-
bid dogs, backed into a corner. The only percep-
tible means of escape is to thrash through any rival 
ideals, hopefully leaving a gang of like-minded zombies in our wake. 
The knee-jerk reaction to fight off the evil neo-
cons or the hell-bound pro-choicers comes too naturally, and there’s something seriously wrong with that.
The loudest, most ardent voices are not right by 
default. Correctness is subjective, and shouting in-sults doesn’t alter circumstance.  
Democrat, Republican, pro- and anti-abortion rights, affirmative ac-tion opponent or pro-ponent, Catholic, athe-ist, pro- or anti-gay marriage: Every one of 
you is right, and every 
one of you is wrong. Our ideals cannot ob-struct our abilities to reason, listen, learn and grow. 
Debate should lead to compromise, not to win-
ners and losers. “I told you so” won’t fix a problem, but practical strategy might have a shot. 
Not everyone is an enemy or a lunatic. They can 
talk, reason and analyze just like you. People are worth talking to, so give them a shot. 
Last Wednesday I was sitting at a table on the 
Mother’s patio waiting for a couple of my friends to arrive. An older guy walks out of the bar clutch-ing a mug. He started talking to the group of peo-ple across from me, and they glared at him with we-don’t-know-you eyes. The conversation fizzled immediately. 
The same guy walked over to me with the same 
conversation lead-in. He wasn’t smashed, like I as-sumed, not even close. I typically would have re-acted as the other group did. Instead, I answered him. Turns out he was a badass from Boston who had done a million things during his life. 
All he wanted to do was bullshit with someone 
while he finished his cigarette. 
I don’t want a medal for talking to somebody. I 
probably did it out of discomfort — I was cornered 
on the porch. Regardless, I enjoyed myself. I actu-
ally learned something from the bespectacled Bos-tonian, and I’m happy about that. 
Break the social trend of unsociability. It may be convenient to cross campus with your 
sunglasses on while your iPod blares and you ham-mer away at your phone’s QWERTY keyboard, but 
it doesn’t hurt to unplug, look up and smile for the 
hell of it. 
Others might even respond.

letters@alligator.org“In my home with my arm around my 
keg.” 
Walch frequently referenced the word 
“keg” or “beer” in his responses. 
Keeping UF’s libraries open 24 hours a 
day was also a hot topic. 
The Orange and Blue Party did not 
support the idea, which was a main point 
on the Progress Party’s platform.
“Three hundred and fifty thousand 
dollars a year,” said Brandon White, trea-surer candidate for the Orange and Blue Party. “This is how much it costs to open a library 24 hours a day for a year. We cannot fund this.” 
Progress Party presidential candidate 
Ben Dictor disagreed.
“Absolutely, this can be done,” he 
said. “To say ‘It can’t,’ is pessimistic.” 
Bickering and mudslinging occasion-
ally ruffled up the flow of discussion as candidates spoke on differing party ideas. 
“Jordan Johnson and the Unite Party 
talk a good game about changing Stu-dent Government, but the students know better than that, because he is part of the same old Gator Party, through and through,” McShera said.
Later on, Johnson called attention to 
White, who criticized both Johnson and Unite several times throughout the eve-ning. 
“Sen. White certainly has a differ-
ent opinion with my party than he did two weeks ago when he came and inter-viewed with my party,” he said. 
Meanwhile, Dictor expressed his irri-
tation at the arguing.
“Again the bickering, did you hear it?” 
he said, while Walch replied via proverb.
“You don’t stop a cock fight by adding 
more cocks to the fight,” he said.8, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, FEBRUARY 16, 2009

carefully, because the symptoms of date rape drugs are similar to those of heavy drinking, Roller said.                                    
Also, because the drug blocks memory, 
the women may have received the drug elsewhere and can only remember as far back as Grog, he said.

UF’s International Center, which co-
sponsors the organization, learned of the incidents through Wednesday’s e-mail and 
is still investigating, said Lynn Frazier, in-

“If this is true, it’s really scary,” Frazier 
said.Women warned 
to watch drinks
ent places and she would just 
be like, ‘Hey, how ya doin’, I’m Lorin Maurer,’ and, you know, it would be on from then,” he said.
He said friends would get to-
gether every week at her house and watch “The O.C.” on FOX and “Playmakers” on ESPN.
“It was pretty sad,” he said. 
“But we loved those shows at that time.”
He said Maurer, who interned 
with the University Athletic As-sociation at UF, introduced him to UF’s Athletic Director Jeremy Foley and Defensive Coordina-tor Charlie Strong at a football game in 2003.
“It was just cool to meet those 
people and just see what they thought about Lorin and how much, you know, respect and admiration they had for (her),” he said.
UF alumna remembered as outgoing, ‘huge Gator fan’The University Police Depart-
ment handed out 127 written warnings and citations Wednes-day for crosswalk violations. 
The crackdown was a result of 
a saturation detail, a strategy in which police assign many officers to focus on a particular type of of-fense. 
The crackdown’s purpose is 
to focus on “the education and enforcement of crosswalk viola-tions,” according to a press re-
lease. 
Thirty-seven of the citations 
were crosswalk related issues, such as failing to yield to pedes-
trians, blocking crosswalks and 
hindering traffic. 
Additionally, 22 
vehicle warnings 
were given to drivers 
who failed to yield to pedestrians, 
blocked crosswalks, ran stop signs and red lights, sped or drove in the wrong direction on a one way street.
Sixty-one bicyclists were 
stopped for failing to yield to pe-
destrians, wearing headsets, rid-
ing the wrong way on a one-way street, riding without hands or having improper bike lights.
Saturation details will contin-
ue during the semester, accord-ing to the release. The next detail is scheduled for Feb. 25 and will 
target lane change and passing 
violations.

ATHENS, Ga. — Defense wins 
championships — or at least road 
games against winless conference op-ponents. 
UF was unable to clamp down on 
Georgia, which poured in jump shot after jump shot in front of the home crowd on its way to an 88-86 upset win on Saturday.
The Bulldogs shot 69 percent in the 
first half and burned down the nets on their way to a 54-47 halftime lead. Three days earlier, Georgia could only muster 48 points in a blowout loss to Tennessee. 
“When you start to make shots, it 
creates a different level of energy,” UF coach Billy Donovan said. “They made 
their first couple shots, and I think what 
happened is their confidence grew in terms of their ability to shoot the bas-ketball.”
Confidence was all the Bulldogs 
had to rely upon. 
Coming into the matchup with UF, 
Georgia was averaging a league-low

ATHENS, Ga. — Georgia 
forward Terrance Woodbury 
hugged the ball with both arms as he jumped up and down in the 
Bulldogs student section, revel-
ing in one of the biggest upsets of the Southeastern Conference 
season. 
Woodbury scored a game-
high 32 points as Georgia (10-15, 
1-9 SEC) knocked off UF (19-6, 6-4 SEC) 88-86 on Saturday in 
Athens.
The Gators have now lost 
three of their last four games and 
back-to-back games for the first time all year.
Point guard Nick Calathes’ 
head fell into his hands while 
cheerleaders waved flags at cen-
ter court.
It’s happening all over again. 
“Our backs are against the 
wall,” Calathes said. “It’s back to 
last year.”
After playing their way into 
the national rankings early last 
season, the Gators unraveled 
down the stretch, losing eight of 
their last 11 SEC games.
The Bulldogs, who fired coach 
Dennis Felton following their 83-57 loss to the Gators back on Jan. 
28, came into the game without a win in conference play this sea-son. 
It was their first victory of the 
2009 calendar year.
Calathes scored 16 points, 
dished out 13 assists and came within one rebound of a triple-double.
“That doesn’t mean anything 
to me right now,” Calathes said. 
“We’ve got a loss against a team 
we should have beaten.”
For the first time in several 
games, the sophomore had help 
on the offensive end of the floor, 
with four teammates scoring in 
double figures.
But as it has been all season, 
the Gators were betrayed by de-
fense.
The Bulldogs opened the 
game with eight straight made 
baskets and shot 69 percent in the first half. 
They finished the night going 
57 percent from the field.
“You can’t win when the 
other team is shooting that per-centage,” said guard Walter 
Hodge, who scored a team-high 
22 points. “We have to play better 
defense.”
The Gators took their first lead 
of the game with 8:06 to play fol-lowing two Ray Shipman foul shots.
But UF scored just 2 points in 
the final five minutes of the game Dawgs stun Gators
SEE DEFENSE, PAGE 15ATHENS, Ga.During a timeout with 35 seconds left 
in the UF-Georgia basketball game on Saturday, the public address announc-
er at Stegeman Coliseum had a simple request. He wanted fans to please refrain from running 
onto the court, if they would be so kind.
Instead, Georgia forward Terrance Wood-
bury and center Albert Jackson went to them.
In a game where it seemed fans showed 
up at halftime when they heard it wasn’t a 
20-point blowout in favor of the Gators, the Bulldogs spread some love by earning their first Southeastern Conference win, charging into the student section and jumping for joy.
A shirtless Georgia fan had his chest signed 
by members of the team. A mosh pit formed 
around an ecstatic Jackson.
“It’s a terrific day for Georgia and the kids 
on this team,” Bulldogs interim coach Pete 
Herrmann said.
That might be a bit of an understatement.Georgia is a mess 
of a program. The Bulldogs are using an interim coach af-ter firing Dennis Fel-ton when they lost to 
the Gators just three 
weeks ago. They struggled to draw fans for this game against a hated rival, and the 10,000-seat arena appeared bare-
ly half-full even at its peak Saturday. A chant of “orange” and “blue” broke out in the sec-ond half.
This is a program whose public address an-
nouncer deemed it necessary to remind previ-ously joyless fans to stay off the court in case of a lone SEC victory.Season in doubt after upset

LSU’s defense slowed down UF 
and may have cost the Gators a lot 
more Sunday.
The Tigers (13-9, 6-4 Southeast-
ern Conference), who have the best 
scoring defense in the SEC and al-
low fewer than 53 points per game, held No. 9 UF to a season-low point total and gave the Gators (22-4, 8-3 SEC) their second consecutive loss by a 66-47 score in Baton Rouge, La.
LSU also put a damper on UF’s 
SEC regular-season title hopes. The 
Gators now trail Auburn by two 
games and Vanderbilt by one with three to play.
“We play in the best league in the 
country, and you’ve got to come on someone else’s home floor not with your best game, but the best game that you’ve played all year,” UF coach Amanda Butler said. “Espe-
cially when you’ve had a little suc-
cess and the target on your back’s a little bit bigger. And we’re just not understanding that.”
Sunday marked the first time 
this season UF has lost back-to-back games.
The Tigers held the Gators to 
just 32 percent shooting, forced 20 
turnovers and recorded 14 steals.
UF, which came up 14 points 
short of its previous lowest season 
output, was averaging nearly 76 points per game before the trip to Baton Rouge.
The Gators were 1 for 12 shoot-
ing from 3-point range, and Steffi  Sorensen’s streak of consecutive games with a three ended at 20.
Even when UF wasn’t being 
defended — on free throws — it struggled to convert. The Gators went just 12 of 22 from the line.
“You know there’s going to be 
nights when you don’t hit threes,” Butler said. “That’s something that you accept. But the free-throw line is not guarded, and the free-throw line is an area where we’ve excelled. It just shows mental weakness.”
UF started the game shooting 1 
of 12 and trailed 16-2 at the 10:38 
mark.
Despite going 0 for 6 from down-
town in the first half and shooting 
just 24 percent from the field, UF only trailed by 11 at halftime.
The Gators got within 8 on three 
separate occasions in the second half but could never close the gap any further.
UF could not stop LSU guard 
Allison Hightower, who torched the Gators with 21 points, many of which came off steals and fast-breaks she started.
Marshae Dotson allowed UF 
to hang around in the second half, adding 15 points and 10 rebounds, but the Gators got little production 
elsewhere.
“Our post players really let us 
down in the first half because I felt 
like we got good looks and just re-ally didn’t play with any toughness at all,” Butler said.
UF fell victim to its toughest 
stretch of the season, going 1-2 against Tennessee, LSU and Van-
derbilt.
For Butler, it’s obvious what the reason is for their poor play.
“Not a tough performance in 
any regard,” Butler said. “We’re 
not playing tough in any aspect of the game, inside-out, mentally or physically.
“When the other team exceeds 
your toughness level, then you’ve got a problem.”

It was a delightful scene, really. Barking fans finally 
got repaid for their loyalty.  An entire conference sea-
son’s worth of frustration rolled right off the backs of Georgia players.
But now that frustration weighs heavy on UF, and 
the Gators’ season is in doubt after a loss that should never have been, a loss that could spiral their year out of control. The team has lost two straight games for the first time all season. UF has just two conference victories on the road. At a time when tournament resumes start getting dissected, bracket makers might find the Gators empty inside.
The craziest part of the Gators’ three losses in their 
last four games is that they’ve all been decided in last-
minute situations. If Chandler Parsons hits one free 
throw against South Carolina on Jan. 21, if Kentucky’s Jodie Meeks doesn’t drain a falling-away 3-pointer on Tuesday and if UF finds a way to sink a basket in the waning seconds Saturday, this team could have one conference loss and a berth in the NCAA Tournament locked up.
Saturday brought a loss that shouldn’t have been. 
But the Gators can’t let two straight heart-crushing de-feats bring them down. Last season, UF lost four of its 
first five games in February, then lost in the first round 
of the SEC Tournament and faded into NIT obscurity.
UF coach Billy Donovan said after the game he isn’t 
worried about the team’s confidence, but after a defeat like this, it might be time to worry.
Half an hour after the game had ended, Stegeman 
Coliseum was empty of fans. They might forget about this game in one week or maybe even one day.
But if UF forgets the sting of this loss to Georgia in 
one week, and if UF is not worried now, an NCAA Tournament bid will elude the Gators again.EvAn , from page 14
and converted on only one of its final 
six possessions.
With the Gators down 2 and the 
clock inside of 16 seconds, guard Er-ving Walker grabbed a rebound and raced down the court.
The freshman frantically dribbled, 
looking for an open man, but settled for a leaning jump shot over two de-fenders with four seconds left.
The ball flew off the rim, and the 
game fell out of reach.
“Erving got caught 
with the ball, and I think what you want to do in that situation is give it up and quickly 
pass it,” Donovan said. 
“He probably held on to it a little 
too long, and I think it’s going to be a good lesson for him on the film how to make a play there.”
Donovan had a timeout left in his 
pocket but decided against using it.
“I’ve been in situations where you 
call a timeout, and you don’t get a great shot up, and playing in transi-tion is better,” Donovan said. 
“I’ve always felt with our team, 
the best thing we do is play in transi-tion.”Donovan decides against calling late timeout
percent from the floor as well as 32 percent from the 3-point 
line, good for last and ninth in the conference, respectively. 
When Erving Walker’s final jump shot bounced off the 
rim and sealed the Bulldogs’ first SEC victory, the score-board showed that the Gators allowed their opponent to 
shoot 57 percent from the field.
“Every SEC team is going to play above their level,” UF 
guard Nick Calathes said. “They were hungry, they wanted 
a win and they got the win.”
Georgia forward Terrance Woodbury set the tone ear-
ly and led the charge in exploiting UF’s defense, which is ranked 10th in the SEC in both field goal and 3-point per-centages allowed. 
The Bulldogs’ senior leader connected on his first eight 
shots and also dumped in 20 points by halftime. Woodbury, who came into the contest shooting 39 percent from the field and 29 percent from 3-point range, converted seven of his 10 shots from deep and scored a game-high 32 points.
Donovan described Woodbury as a “streaky player” and 
hinted he didn’t expect that type of performance when he watched the forward on tape. Both Donovan and UF guard Walter Hodge, who led the 
Gators with 22 points, said the team played well on offense but couldn’t defend well enough to win. Though Hodge 
pointed to the Bulldogs’ ability to spread the court as the 
main reason for their success, Donovan was displeased with his team’s mental mistakes on defense. 
With 7:14 remaining and UF up by 3 points, Calathes 
was called for a foul while attempting to trap Woodbury in the backcourt, resulting in two made free throws and put-ting Georgia in the bonus for the rest of the game.
Just 17 seconds later, forward Dan Werner was called for 
an over-the-back foul on Howard Thompkins, giving the Bulldogs two more free throws and a 1-point lead.
“The balance between maintaining the level of aggres-
siveness and maintaining the level of discipline is a balance we’re still trying to figure out,” Donovan said.Mental mistakes on defense costly to GatorsuPSET , from page 14
