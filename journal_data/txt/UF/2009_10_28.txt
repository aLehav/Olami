Shelter forced to
limit holiday meals
0 ST. FRANCIS HOUSE MUST
ADHERE TO 130-MEAL CAP.
By ERICA JOHNSON
Alligator Contributing Writer
For the first time in nearly 30 years,
Gainesville's St. Francis House will
have to slash the number of meals it
serves on Thanksgiving and Christmas
from more than 400 to 130.
Staff and volunteers found out Oct.
21 that the cap would be enforced for
the holidays this year after the city com-
mission received an anonymous e-mail
about the high number of people served
on Thanksgiving and Christmas.
Until now, St. Francis House staff
believed holiday meals were an excep-
tion to the rule, according to St. Francis
House executive director Kent Vann.
"This year, the city has decided that
this limit applies to holiday meals even
though, for some reason, they havenever enforced it up to this point," he
said. "It's just a requirement we have
to meet, but we just aren't really sure
why."
According to Gainesville spokesman
Bob Woods, the limit was designed to
weigh the negative impacts of the work
St. Francis House does against the ben-
efits.
"What city government is supposed
to do is address the needsLocal of the community whileNews still respecting the rights
of the property owners,
who don't always see things the same
way," Woods said. "People sometimes
forget that even though St. Francis
House is doing a great job, property
owners also have rights."
Woods said the City Commission
didn't know about the shelter breaking
the cap until it got the e-mail.
While Vann said he was unsure ex-
actly what St. Francis House would do,

UF's campus burglaries have more
than tripled from 2007 to 2008.
The University Police Department
reported 41 burglaries in 2008, while
only 13 were reported in 2007.
Ben Hill Griffin Stadium and Mar-
ston Science Library had the most
burglaries in 2008, according to recent
crime statistics released by UPD.
Campus residential areas saw an
increase too. While no burglaries were
reported in 2007, there were 12 cases
documented in 2008. Among the most
burglarized were the Keys and Springs
residential complexes, according to
UPD's annual "UF Together for a Safe
Campus 2009" newsletter.
Although dorms haven't been the
most targeted areas, electronics, com-puters and books were reported sto-
len.
Offices have also been burglarized,
Lt. Robert Wagner said.
"The economic strain and the
recession are two reasons that
there has been an increase
in these burglaries. Because
people are finding it harder to
make ends meet, they turn to
other modes of financial gain,
such as crime."
Pablo deJesus
UPD officer
"Most of the time there is no forced
entry, which means the burglars usu-
ally had access," he said.

Sens. support workers' rights
By CAROLYN TILLO
Alligator Writer
A group of about 20 stu-
dents, some holding signs with
slogans such as "We want fair
food and justice for all," urged
senators at Tuesday's meet-
ing to show their support for a
resolution advocating a pay in-
crease and better treatment for
Immokalee workers.
A resolution is a piece of leg-
islation that states the Senate's
opinion but takes no action.The resolution passed 57-19.
Immokalee workers pick
the tomatoes used by Aramark,
UF's food provider.
The resolution was support-
ed by members from all three
parties.
It encouraged Aramark
to meet with the Coalition of
Immokalee Workers to negoti-
ate a wage increase and a con-
tract that would guarantee hu-
man rights for the workers by
setting oversight agencies in
the farm fields to ensure abusesaren't occurring.
A similar resolution advo-
cating for the workers was pre-
sented last month, but it didn't
pass. Unlike the previous reso-
lution, the new resolution will
be sent to the Office of the Vice
President of Business Affairs,
Gator Dining Services and stu-
dent governments of other state
universities.
Richard Blake, a member
of the Student Farmworker's
Alliance at UF, said the wage

Class studies link between environment, crime
By ALEXANDRA LAYOS
Alligator Contributing Writer
Local criminals may soon find
their jobs harder.
This semester, an urban and
regional planning class at UF is
working with the Gainesville Police
Department to make burglary more
difficult through changes in the en-
vironment.
"Criminals want to remain anon-
ymous," GPD Lt. Art Adkins said.
"If you can eliminate the hiding
places -the areas where they may
conceal themselves -then they're
not going to commit crime."
Changing the environment to
eradicate crime is known as crime
prevention through environmen-
tal design, referred to in Europe at
CPTED.
UF urban and regional plan-
ning professor Richard Schneider
has worked with the Gainesville
police on community-related crime
prevention projects over the past 15
years, often involving his class.
However, Adkins said this is
the first time they've made it astructured endeavor. When Adkins
brought up a more formal partner-
ship, Schneider described it as an
"Aha!" moment.
"This was another opportunity to
collaborate on a project that benefits
the students and both institutions as
well as the wider Gainesville com-
munity," Schneider said.
His class, Defensible Space and
CPTED in Urban Design: Planning
for Crime Prevention, consists of 21
graduate and undergraduate stu-
dents who were divided into teams
and assigned to study sites around
Gainesville including housing areas
and restaurants.
The students were given infor-
mation for each site, including crime
incident reports, photographs and
access to crime mapping files, and
they studied the inside and outside
of the buildings. They took photos
and measurements and talked with
the management of each business
or recreation site.
Adkins said that the students are
looking at four basic things: light-
ing, traffic flow, ambush points and
shrubbery.
Buildings and surrounding ar-eas should be well-lit, human traf-
fic should be kept to specified areas
and hiding places such as crevices
between walls should be avoided.
Shrubs should be no higher than
2 feet so that officers on patrol can
see over them, and trees should be
trimmed to hang no closer than 6
feet to the ground so police can see
under them.
"It's a fundamental way of
learning by doing. Further,
students like projects with
'real world' connections
and especially those that
can make a positive differ-
ence in people's lives."
Richard Schneider
UF urban and regional planning
professor
During nighttime visits, students
are accompanied by Cpl. Audrey
Mazzuca.
"We don't like them going
places at night. They may set off anGPD is overseeing the students' projectsalarm, or people may think they're
burglarizing," she said. "When I go
with them at night, it's just to have
that law enforcement presence."
When the research is complete,
students will make recommenda-
tions to the business owners on how
to make their properties safer.
Adkins said he would also like
the class to create a template of the
process so officers have examples of
what can be done to increase safety
in different situations.
"That's why we chose three
different kinds of places," he said.
"Our long-term goal is to make ev-
eryone CPTED compliant."
One student is also working to
change the city ordinance to require
business owners to comply with
crime prevention through environ-
mental design.
Schneider said the experience
benefits his students in many ways.
"I think getting students out of
the classroom to actually see the
linkages between theory and prac-
tice is essential," he said. "It's a fun-
damental way of learning by doing.
Further, students like projects with
'real world' connections and espe-
cially those that can make a positive
difference in people's lives. I believe

hopes for better results
0 THE MESSAGE SHOULD ARRIVE
WITHIN MINUTES.
By THOMAS STEWART
Alligator Staff Writer
tstewart@alligator org
UF will test its emergency message system
at noon today with hopes of a smoother run
than last time.
In a summer test, it took more than an hour
for some people to receive text messages on
their phones.
Kenneth Allen, UF's emergency manage-
ment coordinator, said that needs to change.
"The results last time were unacceptable
to the university, and the vendor agrees with
that," Allen said, referring to ConnectED,
which handles UF's text messaging service.He said the system was tweaked after the
last test, and UF expects messages to be re-
ceived in a matter of minutes this time.
In previous tests, it has taken between five
and six minutes for texts to be sent.
Today, UF will send texts and e-mails to
about 65,000 students and employees.
Notices will also be
UF posted on UF's Twitter
Administration and Facebook pages,
directing people to the
UF Web site.
Allen said everyone is encouraged to save
the number 23177 to their contact lists as
"UFAlert" so they can recognize the messages
easily in the future.
He also said UF stands by its decision not to
send an emergency message after last week's
scare at the Reitz Union parking garage.
UF admissions ioins Twitter
The account is UF's 25th
By THOMAS STEWART
Alligator Staff Writer
tstewart@alligator org
UF added yet another
Twitter account to its arsenal
Monday.
The new admissions of-
fice account puts the number
of total accounts associated
with UF at 25.
UF was recently found
to have the most Twitter
accounts of any school in a
study by Universitiesand-
Colleges.org.
The study also found UF
third among the schools for
most tweets a day, with anaverage of 45.8.
In addition to the Twitter
account, the admissions of-
fice added
a Facebook
p page, UF
spokesman
f Steve Or-
lando said.
Orlando
sad theO'lando goal of the
accounts is to help people be-
come better informed about
the admissions process and
develop a connection with
the office.
The Facebook page, hesaid, allows people to contact
admissions officers directly
with questions, instead of
calling or e-mailing.
As a result, he said, UF
hopes students are a little
less anxious about applying
to the university, though he
doesn't think it will affect the
number of applicants.
All the different types of
social media come with a
potential downside, Orlando
said -the possibility of fake
accounts.
It hasn't been a problem
yet, he said, though UF has
experienced problems in the
past with false information
being added to its Wikipedia
page.they remember the work -both the
theory and practice -for the rest of
their lives, which is more than the
residual of lots of other academic
work."
On Oct. 20, the students present-
ed their initial findings and recom-
mendations in class to Officer Der-
ek Tirado. The final presentation
to business managers, owners and
residents will take place Dec. 1.
Adkins said the officers are all
impressed with the students' work
and see them more as partners than
students.
"They meet over here from time
to time," Schneider said. "We turn
our DataTrac room over to them.
We want to welcome them; they're
our partners, and they do a fantastic
job. I greatly rely on their input and
their recommendations."
Adkins said that he hopes to
make the partnership long term.
"With the fiscal constraints with
our budget right now, we're not
going to get any more officers," he
said.
"Partnerships like the one we
have with Dr. Schneider's class are
not only a good idea; they are es-
sential for us to continue our cur-
rent level of service."

Court clears UF in
Christian frat case
By THOMAS STEWART
Alligator Staff Writer
tstewa rt@a Iigator org
A federal appeals court dismissed a case on Tuesday brought by
a Christian fraternity that clashed with UF after it was not allowed to
select members based on religion.
The fraternity, Beta Upsilon Chi, also known as BYX, wanted to ac-
cept only Christian members, but UF told the group that was a viola-
tion of university policy.
The group filed suit in July of 2007, but UF changed its policy in Jan-
uary and asked the court to dismiss the case, which it did on Tuesday.
The court ruled that the issue was no longer relevant because UF
had already changed its policy to reflect the group's wishes.
In an e-mailed statement, Jason Hoyt, executive director of the na-
tional chapter of BYX, said he was happy with UF's policy change but
wished the court would have ruled against UF and
set a precedent that would have to be recognized by
other universities.
Nevertheless, he said he hopes other universities
will take heed.
- "Our hope is that the University of Florida's re-
versal will serve as a model for other universities
and institutions who discriminate against people of
Sikes faith," the statement read.
Jacob Frye, the president of UF's chapter of BYX,
referred comment to a spokesman.
A request for comment from the group's attorney was not returned
Tuesday afternoon.
Janine Sikes, UF spokeswoman, said UF is pleased with the court's
decision.
"The court recognized that UF proactively changed its student orga-
nization registration policy," Sikes said.
Sikes said a number of other universities have also changed their
policies to allow student groups to discriminate based on religion, in-
cluding the University of North Carolina, Arizona State University and
Ohio State University.
In addition to BYX, two other student groups had been denied the
ability to register with UF as a result of the old policy.
Gator Christian Life and Kappa Upsilon Chi, another Christian fra-
ternity, were also sent letters in January telling them they could register
again.WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 28, 2009 U ALLIGATOR, 5
Sexy event provides condoms
More than 100 stopped by
By MARISSA GAINSBURG
Alligator Contributing Writer
The Reitz Union North Lawn
invited sexy back Tuesday.
Sex on the Lawn, an an-
nual sexual health fair hosted
by VOX: Voices for Planned
Parenthood, offered students a
chance to learn about safe sex
practices through games and
sexy "Jeopardy!"
"Sex on the Lawn is our larg-
est and most visible event to get
people interested in sexual ed-
ucation," said Megan Frazier,
president of VOX.
"Sexual health is a re-
ally important issue. You
need to learn about it
before you come to col-
lege, where, let's face it,
there are STDs rampantly
running around."
Gaby Likibi
UF anthropology student
Though the day started off
slowly only bringing in about
20 people during the first hour,
by the end of the event, more
than one hundred people vis-
ited.
The event featured a con-
dom race (where blindfolded
students had to put a condom
on a dildo), sexy "Jeopardy!,"
sexy dice trivia game, "Nookie
with Natalie," which was a Q-
and-A session, and reproduc-
tive anatomy coloring pages -
a new addition this year."Education is our goal, but
we take a fun approach," Fra-
zier said. "We play games and
engage the students so that they
can learn things without feeling
like they are being taught."
Visitors received prizes and
free food for their participation
in the games, and VOX offered
free condoms to people passing
by.
Planned Parenthood also
provided free HIV testing in-
side the Reitz Union.One of VOX's main goals
was to inform students that
one out of every four girls in
the United States has a sexually
transmitted infection. It also
showed that learning about sex
could be fun.
UF anthropology student
Gaby Likibi agreed that college
students in general do not make
sexual health a priority.
"Sexual health is a really im-
portant issue," she said. "You
need to learn about it before
you come to college, where,
let's face it, there are STDs ram-
pantly running around."
Psychology majors Stephanie Pila and Rachel Benjamin and
environmental science major David Diaz grab free condoms
from the VOX: Voices for Planned Parenthood table at the Reitz
Union North Lawn on Tuesday afternoon.

Cold Shoulder
City shouldn't put a limit
on holiday meals
he Gainesville City Commission's choice to enforce
a 130-meal limit for St. Francis House this Thanks-
giving shows how disconnected it is from many of
Gainesville's residents.
While City of Gainesville spokesman Bob Woods cites
the rights of neighboring property owners as the main
reason for enforcing the limit, he admits that he was un-
aware of the large number of holiday meals served until
last week.
This is because the neighboring property owners have
not complained in the past. In fact, after years of holiday
meals, a single e-mail complaint that the city received may
force St. Francis to turn hundreds away.
Whose property rights is the commission concerned
about? St. Francis is bordered by the Civic Media Center,
an Italian restaurant, a few homes and some empty lots.
If the commission does not change its stance, we won-
der how St. Francis should determine who gets fed. Maybe
the commissioners can come out and decide who looks
hungriest.
While additional sites might be found, and other local
organizations might be able to pick up the slack, we be-
lieve that enforcing this arbitrary limit is outrageous.
If the commission faced a line of 400 active voters wait-
ing in the cold lines outside St. Francis, the situation would
be vastly different.
But because the homeless don't show up in voting lines
like they do in food lines, it's easy to turn a cold shoul-
der.
Button BattleA n Okeechobee man
said he was fired
from his cashier job
at Home Depot for wearing
a pin that read, "One nation
under God."
Trevor Keezor wore the
pin on his work apron for
more than a year before he
was fired Friday, according to
an Associated Press article.
Home Depot representa-
tives said Keezor was fired
for violating the company's
dress code, which only allows
employees to wear company-
provided pins. Expressing
such personal beliefs is not
allowed.
When Keezer began bring-
ing a Bible to read during his
lunchbreakearlier thismonth,
a manager asked him to take
off the button. He didn't and
was fired.
It's true that Keezor broke
company rules by wearing a
pin that Home Depot did notapprove. But the pin was a di-
rect quote from the Pledge of
Allegiance, not a Bible verse.
Keezor, whose brother is
in the National Guard and

Dress codes are necessary
in any workplace, but having
rules for the sake of rules is
just silly.

Being eco-friendly
aybe it's selfish, but I like to believe that human-
ity has evolved to the point that allows me to
have a few modern mechanical luxuries.
In this Sunday's New York Times, there was a special
opinions section with contributions from students, en-
vironmental activists and regular citizens on why more
people should use clotheslines instead of dryers.
There wasn't a single anti-clothesline voice -it was
all, "clotheslines are like modem art! They save energy!
They're so convenient!" So, I'll take this opportunity to
come out of the pro-dryer closet.
I do believe in being eco-friendly. I'm pretty good
about recycling, and I try to minimize my consumption of
meat. But some choices are more feasible for my lifestyle
than others, and for me, using a clothesline is not one of
those choices.
I barely do laundry now, and my washer/dryer are out-
side my bedroom door. One of my biggest fears post-grad-
uation is living somewhere like New York where I would
have to take all my clothes to the laundromat. That would
never happen. I would rather buy new clothes every day
than drag a hamper several blocks. Add a clothesline to
that, and forget it. I'll just walk around in a Snuggie.
I also happened to notice that none of those New York
Times opinions writers are from Florida. I'm not surprised;
people who don't have to deal with humidity would ad-
vocate clotheslines. It's tedious enough getting my hair to
dry in Gainesville, much less a pair of jeans.
I admit that this sounds obnoxiously lazy and Ameri-
can. But there's a trade-off for our hectic lifestyles. We
can't work 50 hours a week, cook every meal from organic
food that we bought at farmers markets, bike to and from
work and hang out our clothes to dry. In Europe, where
clotheslines are the norm, attitudes about everything areALLIGATOR
www.aIIigator.org/opinions
isn't always easy
more laid back. Sure, they hang out
clotheslines in Spain, but they also
take two months of vacation a year
and have a scheduled afternoon
nap.
You won't hear me claim that
H ila ry Lehman global warming doesn't exist or that
letters@alligator org we shouldn't do anything about it.
But what about things like solar
panels that enable us to use current technology at less of
an energy cost?
Plus, it's hard to make a case for giving up dryers when
the most eco-conscious among us still uses twice as much
energy as a person in a developing country. In one of my
environmental science classes, we had to calculate our car-
bon footprints. The girl who would theoretically have the
best footprint was a vegan, made her own clothes, rode her
bike and recycled, but if the entire global population had
her lifestyle, we would still need more than two Earths
to sustain that type of living. I don't necessarily trust es-
timates of how much energy would be saved by giving
up dryers when our energy consumption is astronomical
simply by virtue of being American.
I would take the bus, carry around water bottles in
my purse until I came to a recycling bin, take two-minute
showers and compost my food before I would give up my
dryer. All I'm asking for is a shirt that I can wear within
two hours of putting it in the washing machine.
I know we only have one planet. I respect that. I don't
want to cause starvation in Third World countries with my
actions. But I've got one life to live, and there are so many
things I would rather be doing with it than laundry.

Weather too hot for fall
Today's date? Oct. 27,2009.
The season according to any
5-year-old that you ask? Fall.
The temperature as of 4:54
p.m on this day: 82 degrees.
Why is it that there are still
summer temperatures when
it is technically fall? Why is it
that we are cursed with eter-
nal humid summer and de-
nied the rouges and oranges
in the trees and frosty excuses
to wear the one sweater we
own? Why, Florida, why?
I do not sweat easily. It
takes a good two hours in
the gym for my shirt to get
decently damp. Yet today I
got a continent-sized sweat
mark on my back walking
from Turlington Plaza to
Little Hall. Most students are
giddy at the fact that they canshowcase their buttocks in
their micro-mini shorts or flex
those hard earned biceps for
another month but not me.
Regardless, this is FALL!
Where is the chilly evening
gust that has you scrambling
for some loafers and a mug of
hot chocolate?
Where are the reds, orang-
es and yellows on the trees to
distract you from a mundane
lecture? Is it asking too much
of Mother Nature to dip the
weather to a nice 55 degrees
at night?
I guess for now I can dig up
my copy of "A Nightmare Be-
fore Christmas," make some
peppermint tea and dream
of a white, well at least cold,
Christmas.

Guest column
Exclusive Greek-only event furthers
When we were in middle school, stuck in an awk-ward stage wearing bowl cuts and braces, not get-
ting an invite to the coolest party in town could've
crushed some of us. Now, however, we're all grown up, and
exclusive guest lists don't move us to tears.
Apologies go out to whoever planned tonight's Greek Only
Halloween Party at XS because your uber-elitist rosters don't
make the Greeks look any cooler. They simply add on to the
far-too-long list of reasons why most people don't like Greeks
in the first place.
As a member of the Greek community, I'm appalled that a
group of individuals felt it necessary to plan a party with the
intention of making other people feel left out.
May I add, on that note, that there are even people who
planned this super-upscale-for-popular-people-only party
who aren't in the Greek system and don't even go to UF.
Not to mention the fact that the Panhellenic Council and
IntraFraternity Council, those students who oversee the GreekAshley Ross system, have nothing to do with the
Speaking Out event and don't condone it either.
The Facebook event reads: "If you
aren't in a fraternity or sorority, don't
waste your time because we have the greek rosters at every
door to XS (yes, even the ones connecting XS and GatorCity)
and only the people on those lists will be allowed in!"
Newsflash people, very few Greeks actually want to come
to your snobbish party. We'd rather pay a few dollars for all-
you-can-drink at Grog or Balls. We'd rather go to Swamp's
Halloween party where happy hour specials will apply all
night and there's a chance of running into (gasp!) non-Greeks
who we like hanging out with, unlike those who think they're
too cool for anyone who doesn't have a couple Greek letters
tied to their name.
Furthermore, absolutely no one is going to try and sneak
into your silly event because it's not going to be that fun.
Although this party may have the intention of getting peo-.gative stereotypes
ple together for a good time, its execution exudes an arrogant
mentality.
The Greek system, which is only about 15 percent of UF's
46,000 undergraduate population, already has a bad enough
reputation; everyone looks at us as people who pay for our
friends, binge drink on a nightly basis and sleep around. So,
now there's an event to showcase slutty sororstitute Halloween
costumes and frat-tastic creepsters who are just trying to get
laid, which is everything we don't want to be known for. Great,
way to take one for the team.
Instead of focusing time and energy on promoting ridicu-
lous events, perhaps this egotistical group of people who think
a Greek-only party is a good thing for the Greek community
should consider dedicating your time to philanthropy, leader-
ship and academic success: the facets of the Greek system that
seem to get lost in a haze of drunken, pompous assholes.

Former UF student arrested for threatening roommate
He said he would cut off his finger with garden shears
By THOMAS STEWART
Alligator Staff Writer
tstewa rt@a IIigator org
Studying criminal justice didn't do much
to keep one former UF student out of trou-
ble.
Seung Yong Lee, 23, has been arrested for
theft, drug dealing and, most recently, ag-
gravated assault and burglary after threat-
ening to cut his roommate's finger off with a
pair of garden shears, according to police.
Lee's troubles with the law go back at
least two years, when he was picked up in
Tampa for allegedly stealing a $660 cash-
mere shirt from Neiman Marcus.
Lee admitted to stealing the shirt, ac-
cording to a police report, and said if had he
known it cost that much he would've stolenone worth less than $300 because he had just
learned the amount that resulted in felony
theft in a criminal justice class.
In May of 2008, Lee was video- and au-
dio-taped selling hundreds of dollars worth
of oxycodone, hydrocodone, cocaine and
marijuana, according to police reports.
Later, when police searched his home,
they found almost 8 ounces of marijuana,
more than an ounce of cocaine, drug para-
phernalia and two guns. Police also seized
20 $100 bills they found in a red cooler dur-
ing the search. He told police the money
was his mom's.
Lee, who was a UF student at the time,
told police he didn't sell drugs to make
money and that he had scholarships.
In April, Lee gained police attention
again when he was pulled over for a traf-fic violation on campus and police found
almost 12 ounces of marijuana, two ecstasy
tablets and drug paraphernalia in his car.
He faced a total of 18 drug-related charg-
es, including five felonies and was banned
from campus.
The charges were dropped, however,
after the State Attorney's Office decided a
judge would likely dismiss
Local them, spokesman Spencer
News Mann said, adding that he
didn't know why the office
thought the charges would be dismissed.
On Oct. 6, Lee was arrested on charges
stemming from his alleged drug deals in
2008. Two days later, on the day he bonded
out of jail, he was arrested after police said
he forced his way into his roommate's bed-
room and placed one of the roommate's fin-gers in a pair of garden shears, threatening
to cut it off.
A third roommate -another former UF
student -told the victim he would cut his
body up with a saw and dump it in the
swamp, according to the police report.
Lee was still in jail on a $35,000 bond as
of Tuesday night.
Lee's lawyer, Joshua Silverman, said the
incident was simply a disagreement be-
tween roommates and said Lee denies mak-
ing any threats.
Silverman said he wasn't familiar enough
with Lee's drug charges to comment.
Lee was last registered as a student in fall
2008, according to the UF Registrar's Office.
As a result of his recent arrests, Lee was
banned from campus again last week.
He told the officers who served the no-
tice that he planned to contact UF about
re-enrolling at a later date, according to a
police report.

City received anonymous complaint
ST. FRANCIS,from page 1
Woods said that the Gainesville city staff has
been working in cooperation with St. Francis
House to resolve the issue.
He said a recommended action plan has
been created and forwarded to the City
Commission and will be discussed at the
Nov. 5 commission meeting.
Woods couldn't discuss the contents
of the plan until it is reviewed by the City
Commission, but he had an idea what the
next step may be.
"In the short term, I think the city will
work with St. Francis House to try to figure
out how to observe the 130-meal limit in the
downtown location but still get everyone a
meal who needs one," Woods said.
He also believes that more responsibility
will fall to local religious organizations."We need more faith-based institutions to
step up to the plate. It is not fair that St. Fran-
cis House should bear this burden alone,"
Woods said. "Some do consistently provide
assistance, but we need more."
But Vann said he there's no easy way to
limit people, and he isn't comfortable with
lowering the number of meals.
The holiday meals, which are served by
about 200 volunteers, usually consist of tur-
key, dressing, cranberries, vegetables, des-
sert and other traditional holiday foods, and
on Christmas, stockings and toys are also
given to children.
Vann hopes St. Francis House can com-
promise with the city and the holiday meals
will be allowed to continue as before.
"Our holiday meals have become some-
thing of a family thing," he said. "It would
be a shame to lose that."Police blame crime on recession
BURGLARY, from page 1
UPD officer Pablo dejesus added
the burglars could have gained entry
by following people into dorms, or
by entering a door that was left open,
neither of which would show forced
entry.
"The economic strain and the re-
cession are two reasons that there has
been an increase in these burglaries,"
dejesus said. "Because people are
finding it harder to make ends meet,
they turn to other modes of financial
gain, such as crime."However, the increase in burglar-
ies in 2008 is not cause for alarm.
Reports show 17 burglaries have
occurred since January 2009, six of
which happened in
On parking garages.Campus "UFPD sees that al-
though burglary rates
have tripled, they were so low to be-
gin with in 2007, with only 13, that
41 total for all of 2008 isn't a huge
amount for one whole year," Wagner
said.

Harvin scored 10 of his 17 touchdowns last season from inside red zone
FOOTBALL, from page 15
Addazio said the Gators still work from
under center in practice, but they're reluc-
tant to use it in place of their usual spread
attack.
"I've been an I-formation guy most of
my life, so I think it's terrific," Addazio
said. "We just don't do it a lot. When you
get down there, you want to do what youthink you do best. In that game, we made
a decision at that point that we wanted to
have a change."
What the Gators did best in the red zone
in years past was run Tebow up the middle
and get the ball to receiver Percy Harvin.
Ten of Harvin's 17 touchdowns last season
came in the red zone, and without him in
the lineup, UF has struggled to impose its
will near the goal line.
Five-receiver formations have just leftthe passing lanes too crowded, and Tebow
hasn't been able to either find open wide-
outs or scramble for scores.
Timing routes like the
five-yard quick slant to Ri-
ley Cooper that iced the SEC
Football Championship last season
haven't been used at all,
and running back Emmanuel Moody-
the toughest inside runner among UF's
backs-has hardly touched the field insidethe 20-yard line.
On the positive side, it's clear to the
coaches that the red zone has been a prob-
lem, and after plenty of time seeing what
doesn't work, Addazio is confident they'll
straighten it out.
"The obvious phases that aren't where
they need to be are turnovers and the red
zone," he said. "We haven't gotten it cor-
rected yet, but we're working really hard
at it. Trust in that, right there."
Walker still expected to play
bulk of minutes at point guard
Andrew Stanfill / Alligator Staff
UF guard Erving Walker played off the ball last year at shooting guard. Now, Walker is taking
over as the starting point guard with Nimrod Tishman expected to provide depth.HOOPS, from page 15
At the team's media day on Oct. 15,
Donovan said he did not expect Tish-
man to play more than a minor contrib-
uting role this year, but his clearance at
least gives the Gators another option
behind guards Erving Walker, Kenny
Boynton and Ray Shipman.
Boynton has shown the ability to
move from his natural spot off the ball
to the point in practice, but Walker is
the only true point guard on the ros-
ter other than Tishman and will be ex-
pected to spend most of his time on the
floor at that position.
Donovan said he has no concerns
about Walker playing the bulk of the
minutes at point guard, but having a
reliable backup fills a need the Gators
had since former Florida point guard
Nick Calathes announced his decision
to play professionally in Greece.
"Playing a lot of minutes, I wouldn'tconsider that as pressure," Walker said.
"That's good for foul trouble or, God
forbid, an injury or whatever -we have
more backup for things like that."
Walker said Tishman has been bet-
ter than expected, adding that his pass-
ing and size are similar to those of Ca-
lathes.
Forward Chandler Parsons said
Tishman's 6-foot-5 frame allows him
to see over defenses in much the same
way the 6-foot-6 Calathes could at UF.
Although Tishman is comparable
physically to Calathes and possesses
a similar skill set, it will still take time
for him to adjust to the American style
of play and develop into the consistent
player Calathes was in college.
"I wouldn't compare him to Nick,
but I would say he has some flashes of
Nick," Parsons said. "He makes some
really nice passes like that, plays re-
ally unselfishly and he can knock down
open shots."
DIFER, from page 15
where he was open and didn't get
the ball, Thompson was seen mak-
ing hand gestures at Tebow.
Thompson had just one catch
for 19 yards and was visibly frus-
trated.
"I'll have a little chat with De-
onte about that," UF coach Urban
Meyer said. "Because we don'tneed that. We need to go as hard as
we can, and that's what we do right
now.",
Thompson has every right to be
upset, though.
Tebow's lack of trust in his re-
ceivers has gotten to the point
where if Cooper and Hernandez
aren't open, that's it. Game over.
It's time to tuck the ball and run be-
cause he trusts himself more than
anyone else.
Tebow opted to run the ball,

into double coverage several times
against the Bulldogs when he had

These are the kind of mistakes
that he prided himself on not mak-
ing the past three years. The one
thing you could always count on
was that Tebow was going to make
good decisions. He was going
to protect the ball. But so far this
season, that hasn't been the case.
So what's the problem? Is Tebowstarting to crack under the pressure
of expectations?
He came into the season being
heralded as possibly the greatest
college football player ever. But
through seven games, he has only
hurt that argument.
"I don't think it's getting to me,"
Tebow said. "Do I have a lot of pres-

me? Yeah. I put a lot more pressure
than y'all could possibly put on me,
so I don't think that's getting to me.I think just wanting to excel, want-
ing everything to be right. Yeah,
that is frustrating not doing it, but
I think that would have been every
year, not just this year."
Tebow has made no secret about
his goal of leading the Gators to
their first perfect season in school
history. But has the pursuit of per-
fection taken too great a toll?
Tebow might have finally found
the one thing he can't overcome: his
own legend.

Gators looking for solutions to red-zone problems
Harrison Diamond / Alligator Staff
UF quarterback Tim Tebow lines up under center and hands the ball off to Chris Rainey for the Gators'
second touchdown in their last 15 red-zone trips in the fourth quarter against Mississippi State.By MIKE McCALL
Alligator Staff Writer
mmccall@a Iligator org
Call it the "dread zone."
One of the main reasons No. 1
Florida has fallen off the blister-
ing scoring pace it set last season
is its lack of production in the red
zone.
The Gators are No. 76 in the
nation for red zone scoring (80
percent), and in Southeastern
Conference play, they've come
away with just seven touchdowns
on 25 red zone trips.
Fixing UF's offense near the
goal line has been a focal point
for coach Urban Meyer following
a 29-19 win against Mississippi
State in which the Gators man-
aged one touchdown on six visits
to the red-zone.
Meyer said after the game he'd
start working on it during the
flight home, and he and the other
offensive coaches spent a rare late
night in the office Sunday.
"We watched every red-zone
snap of the year, evaluated every
snap," Meyer said. "What we're
finding is, in our opinion, it's not
the play-calling. We have to hold
to the plan. Sometimes we're
making a call that's not on the call
sheet, and that's my fault. We're
going to stick to the call sheet anddo a better job."
Breaking away from the call
sheet did produce the Gators'lone
red zone touchdown, though. Us-
ing the I-formation for the only
time during the game, UF got an
eight-yard touchdown run from
running back Chris Rainey, fuel-
ing speculation that the package
will be used more often.
"I doubt [MSU] practiced
that one time all year in think-
ing about us, seeing us do a fake
counter play to Rainey under
center," quarterback Tim Tebow
said. "You could see as the play
developed that they were like,
'What? What is this?"'
"I doubt [Miss St.] prac-
ticed that one time all
year in thinking about us,
seeing us do a fake coun-
ter play to Rainey under
center."

The I-form may have worked
well with the element of surprise,
but that may be the extent of its
use.

UF MEN'S BASKETBALL
NCAA clears Tishman to play
By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
a berry@alligator org
Florida's backcourt just got a little deep-
er.
Freshman point guard Nimrod Tishman
was cleared by the NCAA to play for the
Gators this season, UF coach Billy Donovan
said Tuesday. The clearance brings an official
end to a process that had been hanging over
the program since the freshman decided to
sign with UF.
"That's good news for him and our team,
and at least that's something that's behind us
right now," Donovan said.
Donovan learned about the decision from
the NCAA late Monday night and let Tish-
man and his father know, but the turnaround
was so quick that Donovan announced the
clearance to reporters before he was able to
relay the information to some of his players.In his first 10 days of practice, the native of
Tel Aviv, Israel, impressed his new coach and
teammates with his passing ability and court
vision. In addition to the transition from the
slower European game to a more fast-paced
style of play, Donovan said
Tishman still has "huge ad-
justments" to make before
he's ready defensively.
"In our style of play,
when we're trying to run
and press, conditioning
always becomes a factor,
Tishman and you're always worried
about how a guy at that position can handle
that," Donovan said. "But he's picked up
things very well. He's got a very high bas-
ketball IQ. He's a very good passer. He's go-
ing to be able to give us minutes in the back-
court."
SEE HOOPS, PAGE 14What's wrong with Tebow?
hat happened to TimTebow?
The Heisman Trophy
winner has thrown just eight touch-
downs in seven games.
He already has four intercep-
tions, which matches his total from
all of 2008, and has thrown multiple
touchdown passes in just one game
this year. He threw four against
Troy.
After seven games, the Gators
are ranked No. 80 in the nation in
passing offense. And that includes
games against Charleston Southern
and Troy.
Tebow has accounted for just 14
total touchdowns this year. At this
pace it looks unlikely that he'll get
anywhere near the 55 scores he hadas a sopho-
more in 2007
or even the
42 he had last
year.

UF SOCCER
Townsend rejoins Gators after three-game absence
By TYLER JETT
Alligator Writer
tjett@alligator org
While members of the UF soc-
cer team traveled to familiar South-
eastern Conference destinations like
Athens, Ga., and Knoxville, Tenn.,
Tricia Townsend was exploring Bu-
dapest.
Townsend, a graduate student in
the International Business program,
was required to travel with about
100 other students to Budapest,
Hungary from Oct. 15-23 as part of
a course this semester.
Townsend, a senior and three-
time member of the Southeastern
Conference Academic Honor Roll,only needed three years to earn a
degree in marketing.
"I had a lot of credits coming into
school," Townsend said. "They just
piled-up and it just ended up that
I was graduating in three years. It
came kind of unexpected."
Townsend realized she would
have to miss three games this sea-
son when she was accepted into
the graduate student program
last spring. Townsend and the UF
coaches tried to find a way for her to
stay in the program without making
the trip.
There was no alternative.
"If she didn't go, she would have
failed," coach Becky Burleigh said.
Mindy Kraft, UF director of theMaster of Arts in International Busi-
ness program, said athletes are dis-
couraged from taking a full gradu-
ate student course load, as sports
and advanced studies can make for
a difficult balanc-
ing act.
On Oct. 15,
while her team-
mates traveled
to Tennessee,
Townsend was
on an 11-hour
Townsend flight from Atlan-
ta to Paris, where
she landed before being driven to
Budapest.
The goal of the trip was to give
students experience in anothercountry with a controlled environ-
ment, Kraft said.
During the day, Townsend at-
tended lectures about Hungarian
history and the country's economy.
Students also visited different com-
panies in Budapest to see how they
operated.
At night, Townsend was able to
explore Budapest, notably the many
Turkish baths and the castle district.
"The architecture is amazing,"
Townsend said.
But even with a new city to ex-
plore, Townsend said she couldn't
stop thinking about soccer and was
upset to leave the team in the middle
of its conference season.
"It really helped me refocus onthe season and know that I want to
win really bad," Townsend said.
Townsend arrived back in
Gainesville Oct. 24 at 2 a.m. She
slept for six hours, then did laundry
and packed again.
At noon, the Gators flew to Fay-
etteville, Ark., for a game against the
Razorbacks. Townsend played 34
minutes in her return to the field.
Going on little sleep and adjust-
ing to a six-hour time difference,
Townsend was rusty, but Burliegh
suggested that Townsend's travels
might help her.
"It's kind of good because it gave
her a built-in break," Burleigh said.
"We wish all our team could take a
week off and come back and play."
Men's team ends fall schedule with highest finish
0 UF FINISHED ITS THIRD EVENT OF
THE SEMESTER IN SECOND PLACE.
By KELSIE HOECHERL
Alligator Writer
Five strokes separated the Gators from a
first place finish at the Isleworth Invitational,
their last tournament of the season.
Florida's men's golf team finished its sea-
son in second place -the best finish of the
team's three fall events.
The squad carded a total of 886 (292-292-
302, +22).
With two golfers left on the course, Floridawas tied with Oklahoma State, but was unable
to beat the Cowboys.
"Consistency [was the biggest factor in this
tournament]," senior Tyson Alexander said. I
feel like we were never four-legged, we had
everyone playing well each day and I think
that in college tournaments especially if you
have consistency you're going to be success-
ful."
Alexander finished in a tie for seventh
place with 220 strokes (74-73-73, +4), the best
finish on the squad. This was Alexander's first
top-10 finish of the season.
Battling until the end, freshman Phillip
Choi tied for 16th, carding a 222 (78-69-75, +6)
overall. Choi collected four birdies Tuesdayand finished with a double bogey on his 18th
hole.
"He [Choi] played pretty poorly in the first
round and as a freshman bounced back and
shot 69 which is low round,"
Alexander said. "He was strug-
gling early in today's round
and on a stretch and birdie four
Golf of eight holes. Especially com-
ing from a freshman in a big
time event like that, that's the guy I was most
impressed with."
Junior Andres Echavarria finished with
a total of 224 (75-74-75, +8) in a tie for 20th.
Echavarria was followed closely by senior Tim
McKenney who finished in a tie for 22nd.Junior Robbie Wight rounded out the line
up with a tie for 50th finish.
In Nevada, the Florida women's golf team
continues to compete in the Las Vegas Colle-
giate Showdown.
The squad jumped three spots to fourth on
the leader board Tuesday, with a team score of
586 (289-297, +10).
Freshman Isabelle Lendl is taking the lead
for the Gators, carding an even-par 72 for a to-
tal of 145 (73-72, +1) after two rounds, good for
a tie for ninth.
Lendl's older sister, sophomore Marika
Lendl, tied with fellow teammate freshman
Amelia Lewis in 15th. Both have a 36-hole
score of 147 (+3).
