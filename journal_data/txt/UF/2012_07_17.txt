UF junior Rebecca Harris died Wednes-
day night from injuries she sustained after 
being hit by a car while riding her bicycle 
June 23.
Shands at UF spokesman Andrew Rags-
dale conﬁ  rmed that Harris died at the hos-pital Wednesday night.
As Harris, 20, crossed Southwest 16th 
Avenue at about 12:50 a.m. She was struck by a white sedan that continued east-bound.
When police found the car, it was aban-
doned.
Jessica Paige Becerra, a 22-year old UF alumna, was driving the car, according to 
Gainesville Police. She was arrested on a 
felony charge of hit and run resulting in an injury.
Harris was taken to Shands at UF and 
treated for two broken legs, a broken arm 
and severe head trauma, according to Al-
ligator archives.
Harris was a member of Theta Alpha, 
a Christian sorority, and friends ﬁ  lled 
her Facebook page with 
messages showing their 
support and, later, their grief.
Harris’ family will 
hold two memorials. The 
service in Gainesville will be at 11 a.m. July 28 at First Assembly of God, 
2925 NW 39th Ave. There will also be a ser-
vice in her hometown  in Orlando at 1 p.m.

The Florida A&M University 
Board of Trustees decided at an 
emergency meeting Monday that President James Ammons will step down from his position immedi-ately.
Last week, Ammons announced 
his plan to resign in October after a hazing death and other issues.
The board agreed to pay Am-
mons his 2010-2011 bonus of $81,250. Due to his contract, the board will also pay him a 2011-2012 bonus of $17,062, according to a press release.
In June, eight Board of Trustees members an-
nounced they had no conﬁ  dence in 
Ammons as pres-
ident.  
FAMU has 
been under pub-lic scrutiny for months after drum major Rob-
ert Champion, 26, was beaten to death in a hazing incident. The uni-versity also faced an investigation of fraud in the band’s ﬁ  nances and 
issues with accreditation, according 
to Alligator archives.
FAMU Provost Larry Robinson 
will assume the role.
“I am grateful for this opportu-
nity to serve at this critical time in the university’s history ,” Robinson said in a statement. “There is work to be done and I stand ready to do my absolute best to keep FAMU on its path of success. During this pe-
riod, I look forward to serving our 
students, faculty , staff, alumni and supporters.”
The Board of Trustees must con-
ﬁ  rm Robinson’s appointment at its next scheduled meeting in August.

Foster McHome has seen a lot of chang-
es since he began working at the UF Physi-
cal Plant Division 24 years ago.He remembers when there were more 
than 1,000 employees and when he felt his trade school skills were valued. He re-members when a worker cleaned only one 
ﬂ  oor of a building.
University budget cuts have brought difﬁ  culties for more UF employees than 
just the professors. Physical plant em-ployees working to maintain 900 campus buildings are feeling the effects as well.  
McHome, 59, said there are too many 
buildings and not enough workers. UF pays about 800 physical plant employees.
“It used be fun to come to work,” said 
Maryann Longarzo, 52, who has worked for the Building Services Department since 
1998. “Now, we come exhausted.”Physical Plant employees affected by university budget cutsAmmons

KTUU-TV reported Friday that 
residents didn’t like the mayoral candidates years ago, so they en-couraged enough people to elect Stubbs as a write-in candidate. The town has nearly 900 residents.
Although his position is honor -
ary , Stubbs’ popularity is real. His election earned him enough press to catapult the town at the base 
of Mount McKinley into a tourist 
destination.
Residents say they’re happy 
that their stubby-tailed mayor is promoting tourism. The general store where Stubbs hangs out says it gets dozens of tourists a day ask-ing for him.

Two-faced kitten dies in RI; had 
4 eyes, 24 toes
PROVIDENCE, R.I. — A kit-
ten with two faces born days ago 
in Rhode Island has died.
His name was Gemini. He 
had four eyes, two noses, two 
mouths, two ears and 24 toes — 
seven on each front paw and five each on the back.
WJAR-TV reports Gemini died 
Friday. He was one of five kittens in his litter. He was tiny enough to fit in the palm of a hand.
His owners in Providence say 
he had two tracheas going into 
one throat. They fed him by bot-
tle because he ate very slowly.
Veterinarian Ernest Finocchio 
is president of the Rhode Island Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. He says he’d never seen such a kitten. He says it could’ve been twins that didn’t separate properly.
Two-faced kittens are very 
rare and seldom survive.

90-year-old Maine man sky -
dives for first time
PITTSFIELD, Maine — A 
Maine man who learned how to use a parachute as a Navy pilot during World War II has finally made his first jump — at age 90.
Lester Slate of Exeter jumped 
out of a plane for the first time on Sunday at Pittsfield Airport and was guided to the ground by a tandem jumper, and accompa-nied by another skydiver trailing a U.S. flag.
The jump was a 90th birthday 
present to himself. More than 50 
family and friends watched.
Slate tells the Bangor Daily 
News he was inspired by former 
president George H.W. Bush, who jumped from an airplane on his 85th birthday in 2009.
Slate says he had such a good 
time he wants to do it again — on his 95th or 100th birthday.

During your lunch hour you could read a book, check 
your Twitter feed or catch up on homework. Or you could 
change a life.   
Project MASCOT is looking for student volunteers to 
spend a year mentoring children from at-risk schools in Ala-chua County.
“Many of these underprivileged children do not even have 
parents that are good role models, let alone older siblings, so it is our job as Good Samaritans to help children in need,” said Allison Rosen, the site coordinator of Project MASCOT.
The program recruits about 80 mentors each August to 
spend their lunch time with the children, who are usually in 
fourth or fifth grade.
“I honestly thought that my mentee looked up to me a lot 
because of the similarities we figured out we had right off the 
bat,” said Kevin Ward, a past mentor.
Ward, a 21-year-old mechanical engineering senior, bond-
ed with his mentee through the love of hip-hop dancing. Dur -
ing their meetings each week they taught each other dance moves.
Throughout the school year Project MASCOT mentors also 
raise money to take their mentees to SeaWorld.
Rosen said any UF student taking at least 12 credits can 
join the organization in the fall. Interested students should contact the Center for Leadership and Service. For more in-
formation, email projectmascot@gmail.com.Mentor program

Soon, students may be able to en-
joy a meal cooked and served out of 
a food truck on UF’s campus.
UF Gator Dining Services sent out 
an email to students that announced a food truck would be a new dining option on campus.
The email included a survey ask-
ing students what cuisine, location and time slot they would prefer.
So far, survey results indicate 
students want a food truck serving 
Latin cuisine near Turlington Plaza and Plaza of the Americas, said Jill 
Rodriguez, marketing program manager for Gator Dining Services.
Rodriguez said in an email that 
one food truck will make its debut in the fall.
“The opportunity to introduce a 
mobile food truck on campus allows us to reach more students, faculty and staff,” she said.
The food trucks would only 
complement existing dining options on campus, not take away their cus-tomers, Rodriguez said.
Justin Correll, a UF electrical 
engineering junior, said he would want Latin American cuisine, espe-cially around lunchtime. Although 
he’d never heard of a food truck, he 
wants to try it.
“I try to eat at home to save 
money, but maybe if it was reason-ably priced, like $4 or $5, I’d try it,” he said.Food truck might come to UF in fallIT’S RAINING CATS AND DOGS

Among the shouts of children 
searching for their new pet Satur -
day afternoon sat Oz, a 9-year-old 
pit bull mix, patiently waiting for his turn.
Families stopped to look at his 
chart, but once they saw how old he was, they moved on.
Oz was one of 195 cats and dogs 
up for adoption Saturday at the the third annual Summer Lovin’ Adoptathon at Alachua County Animal Services.
The event started at 10 a.m., but 
people were at the shelter as early as 7:40 a.m.
“It’s like Black Friday,” said 
Courtney Butts, a 25-year-old sec-ond-year UF veterinary student and event volunteer.
Adoptions were $5, and the ani-
mals came vaccinated, spayed or neutered, microchipped and de-wormed. The new owners also re-ceived toys, a collar, a leash and a bag of food.
Normally, the cost of adoptions 
is $85 for dogs and $75 for cats.
UF students and other volun-
teers organized the event.
One of them was Stephanie 
Hon, a 24-year-old second-year UF veterinary student and public rela-tions director for the Adoptathon. Although she was glad to see so many puppies and kittens going to loving homes, she was rooting for Oz.
“I’m a sucker for old dogs,” Hon 
said.
Unknown to the potential own-
ers, a special gift basket would be given to the person who took home the oldest dog, and a piece of cat furniture would be given to the new owner of the oldest cat.
“The main thing,” Hon said, “is 
finding a home for the animals.”
The adoptathon found homes for 183 pets — about three times the shelter’s average monthly adoption rate.
Volunteers will continue to work 
to find homes for the nine cats and three dogs that didn’t get adopted.
Oz found himself without a per -
manent owner at the end of Satur -
day, but all hope isn’t lost for him.
His new foster family already 
wants to adopt him.

marketing program managerAll UF salaries increased by 2 percent in 2009, 
said vice president for Human Resource Servic-
es Paula Fussell. Since then, the university has issued merit-based raises, and then a 3 percent 
raise, intended to offset Gov. Rick Scott’s now-
overruled order that state employees contribute to their retirements.
Building services employee Alberta Hopkins 
Walls, 63, said her workload at the Particle En-gineering Research Center has doubled in the last four years.
She has been president of the 3340 chapter 
of the American Federation of State, Municipal and County Employees for about eight years.  
The chapter has about 15 members, Walls 
said. UF no longer hires 30-year contract union members, instead hiring non-union workers 
through one-year contracts.  
Walls expressed concern about private con-
tractors replacing the Physical Plant Division.
Fussell said the university is not planning to 
outsource the division. Some vacant or unnec-essary jobs, however, have been eliminated or reassigned to other workers.
Curtis Reynolds, vice president for business 
affairs at UF, said the division has been testing 
out what he calls high-performance work teams for about six months. The goal is for groups of 
workers to service designated areas.
The initiative could save money, said Reyn-
olds, who used to be the physical plant’s as-sistant vice president. However, he said the 
method only seems effective for clusters of buildings.   
He said there is no plan to downsize, but the 
primary concern is to best serve the university 
with available funds.  
“If that means getting more efficient, we’ll 
do it,” he said.
McHome said work conditions aren’t what 
they were 24 years ago, but he still has a wife 
and two daughters to support.
“We’re here because we need a job,” he said.4, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, JULY 17, 2012

A big year for Dance Marathon at UF start-
ed with LMFAO’s “Party Rock Anthem,” and 
came to a close Sunday as the event claimed two national awards.
DM at UF took home most innovative 
event and best social media campaign at the Dance Marathon Leadership Conference.
Eden Joyner, the public relations overall di-
rector for DM last year, said a video using mu-sic from the song was the first of many videos that helped the event win those awards.
“I wanted that video to get everybody ex-
cited,” she said. “And it did.”
When she got the job, she realized the 
event didn’t have a comprehensive YouTube account. Twenty-one videos and $886,716.15 worth of donations later, Joyner said the social media approach was a success because it did its job: raising awareness.
During DM, Joyner said, participants were 
encouraged to tweet about seven celebrities in an effort to get a trending hashtag on Twitter. YouTube star Dom Mazzetti even gave the event a shout-out.
Twenty-year-old advertising junior Nicole 
Martinez was one of the event’s public rela-tions captains last year. This year, she’s the new public relations director.
She remembers getting two hours of sleep 
and running around the Stephen C. O’Connell Center, shooting photos and videos to upload 
to Facebook and Twitter.
She said DM won most innovative event, 
though, because of the programs for families 
and children at the 26.2-hour event. The fam-ily room had an “around the world theme,” she said, and children were given a scavenger hunt with activities like “Hug a Dancer.”
“To me, the award really means that at the 
University of Florida, we really do have one of 
the best Dance Marathons,” she said. “Now, 
we’ll strive to do even more.” Dance Marathon at UF 2012 wins pair of national awards

The Florida Museum of Natural History 
likes large items.
Massive skeletons.
Impressive fossils.Sizeable grants from the National Science 
Foundation.
The vertebrate paleontology division of the Florida Museum of Natural History recently received its largest collections support grant ever.
The National Science Foundation gave the 
museum $455,330 for its vertebrate paleontol-ogy collection. The maximum amount the NSF provides for collections is $500,000.
The amount the museum received was the 
exact amount requested, which is not usually the case, said Richard Hulbert Jr., vertebrate paleontology collections manager at the mu-seum.
The museum received the money May 1, 
but the project is just now getting underway, 
Hulbert said.
The grant will allow the museum to buy 
new cabinets and hire extra help for the iden-
tification of about 40,000 extra specimens. It will also allow the museum to hire another employee and to digitize its collection, Hul-bert said.
With the grant money , the museum can 
prepare the fossils that were found locally , said Jason Bourque, preparator and researcher at the museum.
Hulbert said it will help the university 
boost its research reputation.
“Any time we can make a major upgrade 
to our research capabilities that benefits our graduate students, it helps us attract new and better graduate students,” Hulbert said. “It’s just part of increasing the scientific research capabilities of the university.” Florida Museum of Natural History starts project from grant
� DATA SHOWS NO MOSQUITO-BORNE 
DISEASES IN ALACHUA COUNTY.

Alligator Contributing Writer
The deadliest animal in the world is fragile. 
It’s minuscule. It’s the female mosquito.
Alachua County is buzzing with activity af-
ter the deluge of Tropical Storm Debby created 
ideal breeding conditions for the parasitic bugs 
and activated eggs dormant for years.
“We have a boom right now,” said Anthony 
Dennis, environmental health director at the 
Alachua County Health Department.
The mosquitoes’ saliva can transmit diseases 
such as Eastern equine encephalitis and West 
Nile virus, UF entomology professor Phil Koe-
hler said.But disease isn’t the only concern.Domestic animals die of suffocation from in-
haling swarms of mosquitoes, Koehler said.
Residents of Alachua County, however, can 
breathe a sigh of relief.
Dennis said surveillance data shows no re-
cord of mosquito-borne diseases in the area.
“I remember when the rain was coming 
down,” Koehler said. “I was telling everybody 
to wait 10 or 14 days and we’d have a lot of mos-
quitoes. We have five years of mosquitoes com-ing out right now.”
The city has been spraying for mosquitoes 
since late June, but staying inside during dawn and dusk reduces the chance of encountering mosquitoes and disease organisms they carry.
“If you encounter one mosquito or one bear, 
obviously you don’t want to encounter the 
bear,” Koehler said. “But from the standpoint of 
what’s dangerous, it’s the mosquito.”Storm brings more mosquitoes

A Gainesville man choked his moth-
er because he thought she had demons.
Michael Anthony Henderson Jr., 29, 
was arrested on a third-degree felony 
domestic battery charge early Sunday morning, according to a Gainesville Po-lice arrest report.
Henderson stared down his mother, 
Gloria Henderson, 52, and Eugene Scott, because he said he thought both of them had demons in them.
His mother, whom he lives with, told 
him to stop staring.
Henderson lifted his mother by her throat and started to choke her with 
both hands, according to the report. Her 
neck was swollen and scratched.
Henderson left before police arrived, 
but returned only to leave when more 
officers arrived.
Officers and a K-9 unit tracked him 
from Northeast Third Avenue to  North-east 10th Street where they saw Hender -
son at the 700 block, GPD spokesman  Officer Ben Tobias wrote an email.
Henderson didn’t speak after police 
read him his Miranda rights.
He is in jail with bail set at $25,000.

July 18, 1963: The Alligator names UF 
President J. Wayne Reitz as its 1962-63 
man of the year. The newspaper selected Reitz based on nominations by faculty, staff and the Student Body. In 1962, Re-
itz challenged the Florida Legislature to 
provide more funding for state colleges, which was met with widespread sup-port.
July 16, 1991: A UF assistant profes-
sor’s father, Lt. Gen. Claire Lee Chen-nault, is honored with a commemorative stamp and veteran’s status. Chennault 
led the “Flying Tigers” into China on 
Dec. 20, 1941. The Tigers destroyed at least 286 Japanese military aircraft in aerial warfare during its eight-month ex-istence. Chennault formed the volunteer group, and it was absorbed in 1942 by the 14th Army Air Force.
July 14, 1992: A 22-year-old Gainesville 
man comes forward to University Po-lice saying he’s responsible for seven to eight incidents of public masturbation on campus. In early June, students began reporting seeing a man masturbating in the wooded area between Beaty Towers West and Jennings Hall dormitories. On July 3, two female students saw the nude man masturbating in the woods north-
west of Beaty Towers. When the two 
students walking toward Museum Road saw the man, he apologized to them and walked away.
July 16, 2009: The National Coalition 
for the Homeless and the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty rank Gainesville among the fifth meanest 
cities in the nation toward homelessness 
for the second time in a row. Criteria for the list include the number of anti-home-less laws in the city and the enforcement of those laws. Gainesville was cited for insensitive panhandling and public spac-es laws, limiting the amount of food a religious group could give the homeless, and forcing people off campsites without 
offering them an alternative place to go.

Voter purges are an affront to democracy
The 2012 presidential election is coming up soon 
and both sides are gearing up for an all-out battle. President Obama and the Democrats have been 
working overtime to win over groups like the LGBTQ and immigrant communities, while the Republicans have been tirelessly working toward systematic voting purges.
From my ﬁ  rst day in a U.S. elementary school, I was 
taught that voting was part and parcel of what made this country strong. If I was unhappy with a policy, with a public ofﬁ  cial or with an impending bill, I could use my ability to vote and take part in the democratic 
process.
In middle school, I learned about the Electoral Col-
lege and how it stood in the way of my vote. The college 
creates a sort of middleman in the American electoral 
process, and so much has been lost in translation. Of 
course, I’m referring to the 2000 presidential election where the candidate who won the national popular vote lost the election.
Now in Florida, voter purging has become all the 
rage. Gov. Rick Scott has won his lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security to have access to the SAVE Database. SAVE stands for Systematic Alien Veriﬁ  cation for Entitlements. This database contains the 
names of residents who have yet to become U.S. citizens 
and therefore can’t vote.
If one were to overlook this breach of privacy and 
look into the actual accuracy of the database, one would ﬁ  nd, according to the Orlando Sentinel, that research 
has shown it to be outdated or have faulty information.
A preliminary search based on driver’s license in-
formation found 2,625 suspected non-citizens. A closer 
look, conducted by the Tampa Bay Times, found that 
the majority of those suspected were U.S. citizens and 
only a handful were non-citizens.Despite the ﬂ  aws in Flor-
ida’s methods, Scott’s vic-tory and his gleeful enthu-
siasm at purging the polls 
have inspired other states to implement similar mea-sures. Ohio, Michigan, New 
Mexico and Iowa are back-
ing up our governor and 
giving Florida two thumbs up.
It’s important to ensure the purity of our elections 
process, but instituting a faulty search system has re-
sulted in a thinly veiled witch hunt in the name of com-
bating voter fraud.
Voter fraud has not become the norm, and there are 
few cases that show otherwise. However, the extreme 
obsession on restricting certain groups from voting is 
skewing our rights as democratic citizens.
Our country’s main call to democracy was the ability 
to voice our opinions. Today, our options are becoming increasingly limited.
The whole process continues to give credence to the 
emerging phrase, “Democracy for the few.”
The veil obscuring the corruption in our government 
is thinning daily. Soon it will disappear, and all we’ll 
have left is the dark truth that democracy for the major-
ity disappeared a long time ago.
Don’t let the fancy rhetoric of these purges fool you. 
It’s just another method to remove a group’s representa-tion. Be aware and learn the truth behind the words.
Today, you may not think these restrictions mean 
anything, but don’t say you weren’t warned when to-morrow you ﬁ  nd yourself without a voice.

column appears on Tuesdays.Deputy Dilemma
Wrongful police 
shooting deserves    
serious review
Imagine it’s 1:30 a.m. and you’re in your apartment. You hear a knock on the door.
If you own a weapon, you would probably grab it, just 
in case.
For 26-year-old Andrew Lee Scott of Lake County, Fla., 
that decision would lead to his death.
On Sunday, Lake County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce deputies were 
pursuing an attempted murder suspect when they mistak-enly knocked on Scott’s apartment door. Scott answered the door with his gun drawn at the deputies, who then shot and killed him.
Unfortunately, Scott was not the suspect deputies were 
chasing. Deputies knocked on Scott’s door because the sus-pect’s motorcycle was parked across from his front door.
Scott likely approached his front door with a gun because 
the deputies did not identify themselves, according to Lake 
County Ofﬁ  cials, for safety reasons.
This was a tragedy that could have easily been avoided. 
When the deputies chased a suspect into the complex, they 
should have known that they could be knocking on anyone’s door. It seems like knocking on a random door unannounced 
is less safe than yelling, “Police!”
Lt. John Herrell told WESH Orlando, “The bottom line is, 
you point a gun at a deputy sheriff or police ofﬁ  cer, you’re 
going to get shot.”
While that might be the case under normal circumstances, 
this should not be used as an excuse to justify the deputies’ actions. Scott was likely startled by the unannounced knock, and it’s not a crime to be cautious in your own home (or at least it shouldn’t be one).
Scott was not suspected of any crime and police did not 
have probable cause to enter his apartment unannounced. Central Florida News 13’s coverage of the story makes Scott appear more worthy of his untimely demise   — its story leads 
with “A Lake County man with a criminal history is dead 
after a confrontation with deputies.”
While it’s true that Scott had a criminal history and that 
drugs were found in Scott’s apartment, those facts have little to do with his death.
The deputies who killed Scott are currently on administra-
tive leave, and if the events transpired as stated, the deputies should be ﬁ  red and charged with his death.
While police are there to enforce the law, their badges do 
not make them above the law. If police wrongly kill someone, they should face the same consequences as anyone else.

Q: What is a phrase you don’t expect to hear 
in a comedy club environment?
A: “Wouldn’t it be funny if that girl got 
raped by like, five guys right now? Like right now? What if a bunch of guys just raped her?”
This is what stand-up comedian Daniel Tosh al-
legedly said to a woman during a show last week, according to an anonymous friend of Tumblr user “breakfastcookie.”
Her account of the incident said Tosh, at one 
point during his act, started making “very gener -
alizing, declarative statements about rape jokes al-ways being funny, how can a rape joke not be funny, (and) rape is hilarious.”
According to the comedy club owner, Jamie 
Masada, Tosh asked the crowd what they would like to talk about, and someone sitting in the audi-ence suggested rape.
At this point, the targeted woman said she yelled, 
“Actually, rape jokes are never funny!”
“A woman in the audience started screaming, 
‘No, rape is painful, don’t talk about it,’” Masada said.
He said Tosh didn’t joke about rape, but that the 
comedian instead came back with a comment such as: “Well, it sounds like she’s been raped by five guys.”
“I should probably add that having to basically 
flee while Tosh was enthusing about how hilarious it would be if I was gang-raped in that small, claus-trophobic room was pretty viscerally terrifying and threatening all the same, even if the actual scenario was unlikely to take place,” the woman Tosh di-
rected the comment at said. “The suggestion of it 
is violent enough and was meant to put me in my place.”
So, while the differences between these accounts 
may bother some people, the main fact rings true in both of them: Tosh used a rape joke/comment as a defense mechanism against a displeased audience 
member.
Some of you who are familiar with Tosh’s work 
may argue that has been known to make offensive jokes about a multitidue of topics.
You may wonder why the world is taking such 
issue with this instance.Four years ago, the pow-
ers that be brought Tosh to 
perform at Claremont McK-
enna College in California. 
Blogger Charles Johnson thought the college could have made a better choice in its visiting comedian.
Johnson thought some of 
Tosh’s jokes were too offensive or disgusting. These 
are some of the problems he has with Tosh:
• He insults homosexuals, the homeless, and 
“midgets” in his routine, suggesting that midgets 
aren’t real people and that they are responsible for the election of President Bush.   
• He says some rather suggestive and disgusting 
things about Asian women.
• He goes after ethnic stereotypes at every pos-
sible bit.
• He compared President Bush to a retarded 
child.   
• He then goes on to call women “whores” and 
“stupid” and encourages women to get “boob jobs.”
Are comedians SUPPOSED to be offensive? No. Are some jokes that they make going to be offen-
sive to some people? 
Yes.What matters most is location, location, loca-
tion.
Tosh didn’t mention rape as a part of his standup 
comedy act. He used it as a weapon against a “heck-
ler.”
Tosh put rape in an ordinary comedy club set-
ting, which instantly made light of a very serious act of violence.
That’s what the problem is; it isn’t the fact that 
he made an offensive joke. 
The issue here is instead that he pointedly made 
a rape comment directly about an audience mem-
ber.
That’s not OK.

opinions@alligator.orgAfter a decade of diplomatic talks that saw the Iranian 
government repeatedly bait and switch the international community in a deliberate effort to buy more time for its 
nuclear program, even many skeptics anticipated a new outcome from last month’s Baghdad talks between Iran and the six world 
powers (the United States, Russia, China, Britain, France and 
Germany).
The Iranian economy and the Iranian government’s finances 
have been suffering under the most crippling economic sanctions 
of Iran’s post-revolutionary history.
Amid report after report of Iran’s collapsing economy and un-
precedented global isolation, it finally appeared as if Iran had re-
evaluated its position when the Iranian nuclear chief, Fereydoon Abbasi, indicated Iran would consider suspending uranium en-richment as part of any deal with the six world powers.
By the second day of the Baghdad talks, it grew apparent ne-
gotiations were going nowhere as Iran insisted on its right to en-
rich uranium. The talks ended with no deal.
Three days later, contradicting his previous statements, Abbasi 
unequivocally declared Iran would not suspend uranium enrich-
ment. Iran’s nuclear chief then insisted that Iran would continue to enrich uranium to a degree of purity reaching or surpassing 20 percent.
Once again, Iran had misled the international community.We would live in a fundamentally more dangerous world the 
day after Iran acquired a nuclear weapon. All of our calculations 
about global security would be seriously altered for the worse.
A nuclear Iran could deal a historic setback to the internation-
al community’s nonproliferation goals. 
Diplomatic milestones like the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty of 1968, coura-geous efforts like Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev working together to reduce American and Russian stockpiles, 
and global efforts to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty could all be effectually undone by an Iranian acquisition of nu-clear weapons.
If Pakistan was not above peddling nuclear materials and se-
crets in the international black market for years without detec-tion, an outlaw state like Iran certainly presents a similar risk.
Moreover, a nuclear Iran would likely provoke a nuclear arms 
race in the Middle East, a nightmare scenario for global security. Saudi Arabia has already announced its intention to aggressive-
ly pursue nuclear weapons in the event that Iran acquires them 
first.
Turkey, Egypt and Jordan have also been mentioned as po-
tential proliferators. Nuclear gamesmanship in the world’s most unstable region could also re-escalate a nuclear standoff between India and Pakistan.
Finally, there is the threat that Iran would deliver a nuclear 
bomb to its terrorist agents.
To appreciate just how urgent the Iranian situation has be-
come, it was recently confirmed that Iran has been enriching its 
uranium stockpiles up to 27 percent. While Iran claims the enrich-
ment is for a research reactor, most civilian reactors use uranium enriched to just 4 or 5 percent.
While 27 percent seems far away from the 90 percent enrich-
ment threshold for weapons-grade uranium, enrichment is not a straight-line process; it is more of a curved exponential process. As a result, Iranian enrichment is estimated to be about 80 percent of the way toward producing nuclear weapons-grade uranium.
The Obama administration deserves praise for uniting the 
world against Iran’s nuclear program. Under the president’s 
leadership, Iran has faced an unprecedented degree of economic 
and political isolation.
The price of a military strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities is cer -
tain to be unpredictable and destabilizing, and the president of 
the United States is responsible and wise to exhaust all alternative options first. The sanctions should be given more time to work.
However, Iran’s behavior at the Baghdad talks reflected an ir -
rational commitment to nuclear proliferation in the face of eco-nomic and social ruin.
There is simply no telling where Iran’s breaking point is, and 
the time is soon when it will become too risky to find out.

FORT WHITE — Mark Weissen-
berg says he has felt the heartbeat of 
America.
Inside his 7-by-14-foot wagon, the 
66-year-old Cleveland, Tenn., native 
lies sideways on top of a memory 
foam mattress as he ﬁ  ddles with pil-lows to support his aching back.
Weissenberg spent most of Fri-
day sleeping, a luxury for him af-ter spending nearly nine and half weeks traveling almost 600 miles by horse and wagon from Tennessee to Florida.
But the trip was well worth it, he 
said.
“This was my only shot,” he said. 
“How many more opportunities am I going to have? This is it.”
As a child, Weissenberg grew up 
idolizing famous Western ﬁ  lm stars like John Wayne. He dreamed of one day becoming a cowboy himself, 
and his yearning only grew.
His wife, Romona, suggested 
a dude ranch, but Weissenberg re-
fused, insisting he wanted to do something on his own.
And then the idea came to him: 
a trip to Florida in a horse-drawn wagon to see a side of America he said has been lost.
In November, Weissenberg 
searched through eBay to ﬁ  nd a wagon that would be suitable for his trip. According to his trip journal, he found a $1,100 wagon frame after 
four hours.
Two months later, the frame from 
northern Michigan arrived at his 
home, and the work began.
When Weissenberg told his fam-
ily about his plan, he was met with mixed emotions.
His wife disapproved of the 
trip because of safety concerns. But Karen Lambert, 45, Weissenberg’s stepdaughter, was happy for him to follow his dream.
After nearly six months of work-
ing with luan wood and Styrofoam — including one rebuild — Weis-
senberg completed his rig.
“It wasn’t built the best, but it did 
the job for me,” he said.
Like a small apartment, the wag-
on was outﬁ  tted with an air condi-
tioning unit, Wi-Fi Internet, a small bed, a fridge and a generator.
According to his journal, the 
wagon and supplies for the trip cost 
Weissenberg about $16,000.
“This is not your daddy’s wag-
on,” Weissenberg joked.
Gadgets wouldn’t get him there, 
though. He also needed horses.To pull his 3,500-pound cara-
van, in April Weissenberg bought 
Sussie and Clara Jo, two 12-year-old Percheron horses, at $3,500 each. 
Then he was ready.
Before he left, several friends and 
neighbors visited Weissenberg at his 
home to wish him farewell.
Rabbi Shaul Perlstein, co-director 
of Chabad-Lubavitch of Chattanoo-ga, blessed Weissenberg’s wagon and left a note in Hebrew on the driver’s side.
On May 11, Weissenberg left his 
home in Tennessee for the open road to Ocala.
“I didn’t take a speciﬁ  c route,” he 
said. “I just ﬁ  gured ‘let’s just go.’”For the next nine and half weeks, 
Weissenberg traveled through Geor-gia and north Florida, stopping in small towns to rest and water his 
horses.
On average, Sussie and Clara Jo 
covered 20 to 25 miles a day. Weis-
senberg used a GPS to keep himself on track.
He also installed a large rear view 
mirror, ﬂ  ashing lights and a large re-ﬂ  ecting triangle to warn drivers at night that he was on the road.
Throughout his trip, Weissen-
berg met a variety of people as he inched his way through the Georgia backroads.
There was Jack Miller of Barwick, Ga., who let Weissenberg stay at his barn for three days because of the heat; Joe O’Neal of Madison, Fla., who Weissenberg said had the only 
factory red 1968 Shelby Mustang 
hidden in his garage; and the chil-dren and faculty at Cave Springs El-ementary in Cave Springs, Ga.
For each person who met Weis-
senberg, brought him supplies or took a picture with his wagon, they all wrote encouraging messages or their names on the wagon’s wood 
frame.
“It’s the idea that Americans still 
care for one another,” he said. “It’s 
really uplifting.”
On July 12, Weissenberg ended 
his trip at a friend’s house just south of Fort White.
Although Ocala was the origi-
nal destination, Weissenberg said 
Fort White police ofﬁ  cers urged 
him to reconsider because of safety issues with heavy trafﬁ  c near High Springs.
Weissenberg said he was almost 
hit by cars three times while riding to Fort White.
Despite the change in plans, 597 
miles by horse and wagon was a 
“trip of a lifetime,” he said.
Weissenberg sold his horses to a 
plantation owner in northern Flori-
da. He also plans on taking apart the wagon, varnishing the outside walls and hanging them in his house.
At his friend’s house on Friday , 
Weissenberg’s wagon was covered with writing.
On the driver side, Perlstein’s He-
brew message from the ﬁ  rst day of the trip is now crowded with names and messages, but the translation re-ﬂ  ects an enlightening journey.
“As you travel peacefully through 
the world, you shall leave a peaceful world behind.”

The Alligator Awards - Best Individual Performance

THE ALLIGATOR AWARDS
  As part of The Alligator Awards recognizing 
the best in UF athletics during the 2011-12 
season, columnists Joe Morgan and Corey 
McCall will debate two of the ﬁ  ve nominees in each 
week’s category. Vote for the winner online at al-
ligatorSports.org.
  Joe: Ben Sheets reminded me why I love 
sports Sunday afternoon. Sure, every Braves 
fan enjoyed completing a three-game sweep against the Mets over the weekend, but Sheets’s 
six shutout innings meant more than  laying 
the groundwork for Atlanta’s seventh straight win (Go Bravos!). Sheets made a triumphant 
return to the mound after undergoing surger-
ies for a torn ﬂ  exor tendon (twice), a UCL tear (ahem, Tommy John) and damage to a prona-
tor tendon since 2009. Whether the obstacle is a debilitating injury 
or a seemingly in-
surmountable def-
icit on the score-board, sports fans 
love comebacks 
— and rallies! Cue 
rimshot. That be-
ing said, who can forget Florida’s 
heartwarming, 
never-say-die comeback in a 54-32 win against Furman. Wait, you didn’t see it? Awkward.
  Corey: Stick to the John Carter references, 
more people can relate — heartwarming and never-say-die seem to ﬁ  t the John who lived 
up to the hype better anyways. Let’s rewind a week from that 
embarrassment you 
say is a comeback 
to the real contender for this week’s de-
bate: the volleyball 
team rallying from 
two sets down to 
defeat SEC West leader Arkansas. 
After dropping the 
ﬁ  rst two (18-25, 30-32), Arkansas was well on 
its way to securing a solid lead in the West, and 
Florida was about to drop three games behind 
Tennessee with only three conference games left. Instead, sophomore Chloe Mann solidiﬁ  ed 
herself as a threat at the middle-blocker posi-tion, and behind a record performance, led the 
Gators to a ﬁ  ve-set victory on the road.
  Joe: Granted, the UF volleyball team dug 
in their heels for an impressive comeback, but the Gators football team’s rally against the 
Paladins was not simply a walk through the 
empty bleachers at Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium. 
It would have been easy to roll over and die 
of embarrassment. Hell, Nick Saban lost to unranked Louisiana-Monroe 21-14 at home 
in his ﬁ  rst year rebuilding at Alabama in 2007, 
and he turned out just ﬁ  ne. Clinging to a 37-32 lead with bowl eligibility on the line, the 
Florida defense stepped up with two intercep-
tions returned for touchdowns in the fourth  Which Gators comeback was most impressive last season?

SEE RALLY, PAGE 20  STAFF REPORT
    
 Although they haven’t 
competed for Florida yet, 
three incoming freshman have already started proving their worth to the 2012-13 track and 
ﬁ  eld team. Shayla Sanders, 
Arman Hall and Robin Reyn-olds have spent the past week competing at the 2012 IAAF World Junior Track and Field Championships in Barcelona, Spain.
  Together, the future Gators 
earned three medals for Team 
USA, two of which came from 
relay events.
  Hall, the sprinter from 
Pembroke Pines, won the ﬁ  rst medal after ﬁ  nishing second in the 400 meters. He used a personal best of 45.39 to claim the silver and upset Aldrich Bailey, who has the fastest 
high school time in America. 
  However, winning a medal 
in one event wasn’t enough 
for Hall. He wrapped up his week in Spain by running the anchor leg of the 4x400-meter 
relay. Hall ran a 45.78 to help 
grab the gold and set a new junior-world-leading time of 3:03.99.
  “It’s great to ﬁ  nally get on 
the medal stand with a gold medal,” Hall said. “It’s a great feeling being around all of these talented guys. It was a 
lot of fun. I wish I could do 
this again soon. It was a great experience to come overseas again. Great environment, great experience and great people — I loved it.”
  Sanders, the Gatorade Flor-
ida Girls’ Track and Field Ath-
lete of the Year ran the anchor 
leg to win in the 4x100-meter relay. The Lauderdale Lakes native help set a world-junior-leading time of 43.89. 
  Reynolds was the last of 
the incoming freshmen to ﬁ  n-ish competing at the World Junior Track and Field Cham-
pionships. 
  The sprinter competed in 
a runoff for the 4x400-meter 
relay team, running a time of 3:34.25. Like Hall and Sand-ers, Reynolds helped set a world-junior-leading time. Al-though Reynolds competed in the runoff for the semiﬁ  nals, 
she didn’t run in the ﬁ  -nals because she was an 
alternate for the event.
  In addition to the three fu-
ture Gators, sophomores Tay-lor Burke and Ciarra Brewer also competed in Spain.
  Brewer ﬁ  nished sixth 
overall in the triple jump with a leap of 13.38 meters. The Southeastern Confer-ence Champion was the only American to make it to the triple-jump ﬁ  nals. 
  Burke wrapped up her ﬁ  rst 
year competing for Florida by ﬁ  nishing 16th in the high jump with a mark of 1.79 meters.  UF recruits shine at IAAF 
World Championships

14, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, JULY 17, 2012
 Brett Le Blanc / Alligator Staff
  T.J. Vogel watched one of his drives at the SunTrust Gator Invitational on Feb. 12. The 
senior ﬁ  nished second with a tournament total of 207 (-3).  
  STAFF REPORT
    
 Recent success on the green may help T.J. 
Vogel add a green jacket to his wardrobe.
  Vogel will likely receive an invitation to 
play at the 2013 Masters Tournament after 
winning the 2012 U.S. Amateur Public Links Championship held at Soldier Hollow Golf Course in Midway, Utah on Saturday. Every APL champion has been invited since 1988.
  Vogel, a NCAA Division I Second Team 
All-American, defeated Kevin Aylwin 12 & 10. The senior Gators golfer is currently ranked 33rd in the Men’s World Amateur Rankings.
  “He is a great kid and player and has 
worked very hard to do what he has done,” UF coach Buddy Alexander said. “He will be fulﬁ  lling every young player’s dream by going to the Masters Tournament. It is a good day for him and Gator golf.”
  The championship began on July 9 with 
two rounds of stroke play, which cut the starting ﬁ  eld from 156 golfers to the lowest 
64 scorers. Vogel ﬁ  nished stroke play with 
the second lowest score, 6-under-par for 36 
holes.
  Vogel earned the second seed and ad-
vanced to match play, where he defeated Paul Misko (1 up), Greg Condon (1 up), An-
ton Arboleda (3 & 2), 2012 US Open-qualiﬁ  er 
Alberto Sanchez (1 up) and 2011 runner-up 
Derek Ernst (4 & 3). 
  Vogel’s performance in match play se-
cured him a spot in the ﬁ  nal match.
  Vogel did not lose one hole to Aylwin. In 
26 holes, Vogel recorded 10 birdies and no bogeys. He nearly matched the record for 
the USGA 36-hole ﬁ  nal margin-of-victory of 
12 & 11, but he halved the 24th hole.
  In addition to likely receiving a bid to 
play at the Masters, Vogel also received a 10-
year exemption from quali-
fying for the U.S. Amateur 
Public Links, exemptions from qualifying for the next 
two U.S. Amateurs and exemptions from lo-cal qualifying for the next three U.S. Opens 
if he remains an amateur.
  Vogel was named a ﬁ  rst-team All-South-
eastern Conference selection and a PING 
All-Southeast Region Selection last season. 
Before transferring to Florida from USC, 
Vogel was named as a 2011 All Pac-10 hon-
orable mention, earned 2010 NCAA West 
Region and All-Pac-10 ﬁ  rst-team honors and was Pac-10 Co-Freshman of the Year in 2010.  Vogel wins Amateur Public Links title, likely to play in ‘13 Masters
Wide receiver — Although Florida 
has three commits at the wide 
receiver position, the Gators 
need one of the three in Ahmad Fulwood, Marqui Hawkins and Rodney Adams to develop into a primary target. Adams called the five-yard hitch his favorite route and said he isn’t afraid of running routes across the middle. HB Chris Rainey led the Gators last season in receptions. Although he ranked first on the team in yards and yards per catch, redshirt junior Andre Debose ranked fifth on the team in receptions last season with 16. Florida didn’t have one receiver listed in the top 10 in the SEC in 2011. The Ga-tors signed two receivers last year in Latroy Pittman and Raphael Andrades.With UF football’s Friday Night Lights camp 10 days away, here is a list of 
positions of need for the 2013 recruiting class. 
Rivals.com ranks Florida seventh nationally with its 18 commits.
Offensive Line — Will Muschamp called the Gators “soft” after 
a 21-7 loss to Florida State last season. Florida ranked eighth in the Southeastern Conference with four yards per rush and allowed 1.77 sacks per game. The arrival of D.J. Humphries and Jessamen Dunker give Florida depth up front in 2012, but the 2013 class could use big bodies. Three-star prospects Cameron Dillard (Canton, MI.), Roderick Johnson (Delray Beach, Fla.) and Joshua Outlaw (Lithonia, Ga.) all committed to UF in the spring. The Gators are awaiting the decision from five-star OL Laremy Tunsil who lists Florida, Alabama and Georgia as his top three.
Defensive End — With a thin line, the Gators played Sharrif Floyd 
out of position at defensive end last season. A shoulder injury hampered hybrid linebacker Lerentee McCray in 2011. As a result, Florida went heavy on the defensive line in 2012 with five incoming freshmen arriving as defensive ends. Dade City product Joey Ivie, a four-star end from Pasco High School, is the lone end committed for 2013. Jordan Sherit, a four- star prospect from Hillsborough High School remains a target and lists Florida in his top 10. Sherit placed ninth in the SPARQ National Championship at The Opening in Beavertown, Ore. SPARQ measures speed, power, agility, reaction and quickness in a variety of exercises. Rotary Lombardi Award Watch List -

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
 
BIRMINGHAM, Ala. — Southeastern 
Conference Commissioner Mike Slive has 
unfinished business and he isn’t leaving what has lately become college football’s penthouse anytime soon.
With two new members, six straight foot-
ball national titles and a four-team playoff to determine future champions. Slive tells The Associated Press he has agreed to run the powerhouse SEC for “at least a couple more years,” continuing his decade-long tenure.
His contract was set to expire July 31, 
five days after he turns 72.
Slive is negotiating new TV deals that 
figure once again to be the most lucrative in college athletics. The exact method of choos-ing the four-team playoff field each season must be hammered out, and the SEC is try-ing to assimilate Texas A&M and Missouri into the now-14-team league.
The commissioner discussed those issues 
— and his future — in an interview ahead 
of SEC media days, which run Tuesday 
through Thursday in suburban Birming-ham.
“I have agreed with the league that I will 
stay at least a couple of more years, and then we’ll sit down and decide what hap-pens after that,” said Slive, who makes just over $1 million a year.
“Don’t forget it takes two. It’s not just 
me making a unilateral decision. Both of us need to make that decision.”
Auburn’s Jay Jacobs, chairman of the 
league’s athletic directors, noted that the SEC produced 42 Academic All-Americans, nine national team champions and seven runners-up in 2011-12.
“There’s absolutely no doubt in my mind 
that Mike Slive is the best commissioner in 
the nation,” Jacobs said. “It’s not an acci-
dent that the dominance of the SEC in re-cent years coincides with his tenure as com-missioner. We all know the SEC has won six straight BCS national championships in football. His leadership transcends football and even all of athletics.”
The professorial Slive, who became a 
first-time grandfather this summer, has no 
shortage of projects before handing over the 
reins.
University presidents approved the switch to a four-team playoff model on June 26, similar to the one Slive proposed in 
2008, three years into the SEC’s current run 
of dominance. It might have taken an all-SEC West showdown of Alabama vs. LSU in January to rally sufficient support from other commissioners, athletic directors and presidents.
Slive said conference commissioners will 
gather in September to work on details like revenue distribution and a college basket-ball-style selection committee for the four 
semifinalists.
“We’ll have to sit down and talk about 
what would be an appropriate number” for 
the committee, said Slive, who chaired the Division I Men’s Basketball Committee for the 2008-09 season. “There have been differ -
ent numbers floated around — 16, 20. We certainly want to have enough members of the committee so that when certain com-mittee members have to recuse themselves, 
we still have a significant group of people 
considering all the data and evaluating the teams.
“I visualize it working not unlike the 
men’s basketball committee that I was on and chaired for a year. You have both data and statistics and information, and then you couple that with what you see.”
The SEC might have had even more 
shots at a national title under the four-team system. The league had at least one team ranked among the Top 4 in the final BCS standings in 11 of the 14 years the system has been used.
Using that formula, at least, two teams 
would have made the cut in both 2006 (No. 2 Florida and No. 4 LSU) and 2008 (No. 2 Florida, No. 4 Alabama) as well as 2011. The 
first two times could have led to a rematch 
of the SEC championship game in the fi-nale.
Slive demurs when asked if the change is 
yet another win for the SEC.
‘I think it’s a win for everybody,” he said. 
“It’s a win for college football in that all of us were able to come together in a collegial way and find a way to marry our own paro-
chial interests as advocates for our leagues 
with our responsibility for what’s in the best interest of college football.”
Despite all that, the first order of business 
for the SEC is a likely return to the top of the heap in TV money. The league is renegotiat-
ing its pre-expansion 15-year, $2.25 billion 
TV deal with ESPN and a $55 million-a-year 
contract with CBS, both signed in 2008. The Pac-12 has a $3 billion TV deal.
Slive said “there is no fixed timetable” 
and he’s not sure if new deals will be in place before the SEC’s quest for national 
title No. 7 in a row begins.
“It’s hard to know because we have 
meetings scheduled throughout this sum-
mer,” Slive said.
“Whether or not those meetings come to 
a conclusion, I can’t predict.”
SEC schools each got a $20.1 million 
share of the financial pie in 2011-12.
Texas A&M and Missouri both give the 
SEC a big presence into sizable new TV markets as part of a wave of conference re-alignment.
“We believe that the expansion has in-
creased our value for the purpose of televi-sion,” Slive said.
“It’s one of the many benefits that we 
believe we will derive, particularly in the long-term, from this expansion.”TUESDAY, JULY 17, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 15

Three Things to Watch Three Questions 
1. Only Football Questions, Please
With the recent hiring of John L. Smith, Arkansas looks to put the Bobby Petrino scandal in the 
past and focus on the upcoming season. However, be prepared to learn a lot about Smith’s ethical standards and what the players took out of the whole situation. Coming off of an 11-2 season, and retaining quarterback Tyler Wilson, the Razorbacks show a lot of promise, but with a new head coach, a lot of questions too.
2. The Big 13 and 14
With Texas A&M and Missouri to make their first appearances at SEC Media Days this year, fans look to get a taste of what’s to come. After playing in a depleted Big-12 conference, the Aggies and Tigers face a tough road in a conference that owns the last six BCS National Championships. The 
spotlight begins now, welcome to the SEC.
3. The Ol’ Ball Coach
South Carolina head coach Steve Spurrier is notorious for bringing up controversial topics. Last year 
it was paying athletes, and recently, he has shown opposition towards the rule that allows non-conference games to count towards division tiebreakers. What he will do this year, no one can say, but one things for sure, it will be much more entertaining than the written speeches given from every player and coach.
- Corey McCall, Alligator Staff Writer1. What’s next for the SEC?
At the 2011 SEC Media Days, the conference had 12 teams and the old BCS was status quo. Due 
largely to the efforts of league commissioner Mike Slive, the SEC now boasts 14 members and college football will debut a four-team playoff starting in 2013. With negotiations for a new televi -
sion deal in the works, what Slive has planned for the conference next is anybody’s guess. How the 
coaches and players will react to his latest changes should make for an interesting week.
2. Does Florida have strong player leadership?
Gators coach Will Muschamp will bring linebackers Jon Bostic,”Buck” Lerentee McCray and running 
back Mike Gillislee to Hoover, Ala., this week. It may just be a media circus filled with nothing more than throwaway quotes, but the attitude of the trio will go a long way setting the tone for the UF moving forward. Florida has lacked strong leadership from its roster since the departure of players like Tim Tebow and the Pouncey brothers. It is time for these players to take up the mantle.
3. Who is the cooler James Franklin — Mizzou QB or Vandy coach?
With Missuori (ou) joining the SEC this season, the conference welcomes a new James Franklin for the second straight year. While quarterback Franklin had a 139.9 passer efficiency and averaged nearly 296 yards per game last season, coach Franklin brought some much-needed swag — and a bowl bid — to Vanderbilt. Both take the stage today, and one will emerge cooler. I’ll give the advan-tage to Vandy’s head coach.

quarter. After banging the turnover-
margin drum to no avail all season 
long, Muschamp could look at the 
box score and smile. The Gator Na-tion wiped its collective brow after 
the near-upset. The ghost of Ingle 
Martin’s wrongful ouster from the 
starting quarterback spot by former 
coach Ron Zook had been defeated.
Corey: Sure Florida came from 
behind in dramatic fashion, but the fact of the matter remains, that game should have never been in question. 
As a 31.5-point favorite, the Gators 
embarrassed themselves by trailing 
in the second quarter. By halftime 
though, they had made their push and were sitting with a 27-22 lead. 
The true culprit of fans wiping their 
brows was the humidity, and if you’ve seen “Ghost Hunters,” then 
you should know ghosts are made 
up. Now let’s rewind again, this time 
to 2008 — that marks the last time 
the volleyball team has overcome a 2-0 deficit and won. So, this feat is 
not done very often, and facing an 
opponent such as Arkansas makes it that much more impressive. With 
how much Will Muschamp smiles 
normally, I doubt he found anything gratifying in the Furman game. Mary Wise, however, had a lot to smile about after their performance. 
Mann had a career-high 19 kills and 
a match-high five blocks putting her at 21.5 points for the match, the most 
for a Gator middle-blocker since 
moving to 25-point sets in 1999. Se-
nior Kristy Jaeckel added 19 kills and 
10 digs for her eighth double-double of the season, and senior Kelly Mur -
phy also had a double-double with 15 kills, 32 assists, seven digs and three blocks. Hell, even I’m smiling.
Joe: Ghosts are real! I know for a 
fact that Ghostbusters was a real-life documentary and not simply a pop-
corn flick. Bill Murray would back 
me up on this. The famed comedian 
would also support my claim that 
Florida’s comeback against Furman avoided catastrophe in Gainesville. 
With all due respect to the Elite-Eight 
volleyball squad, the Gator Nation would not have fallen into an anar -
chic panic had the Gators failed to rally against the Razorbacks. How-
ever, a defeat at the hands of the Pal-
adins — and the ghost of Ingle Mar -
tin — would have put the writing on 
the wall for Muschamp. A 5-7 inau-
gural campaign would have been much worse than the 7-6 record that 
disappointed many UF fans. When Saban lost to Lousiana-Monroe in 
2007, he at least had a track record to stand on. Without the comeback 
against Furman, the Muschamp Era 
at Florida would be in a significantly different place. Let’s say, Barsoom.
Corey: Sure Florida fans were 
fearing an upset after Furman put 
up 15 straight, but that was short 
lived. By halftime the Gators were up and never looked back, one could 
only look at the Paladin’s success in 
the first quarter as a fluke. Unlike the football team — still having three 
quarters of play left — the volley-
ball squad was in a do-or-die situa-tion. Either win three straight sets or 
go home knowing you don’t have 
a chance of winning the SEC East. 
Granted they did not get it anyway, 
but a lot of hope was riding on beat-ing Arkansas. In the end, that game 
put Florida in a tie for second with 
Kentucky in the East, a better posi-tion heading into the NCAA Tourna-
ment. Maybe that game influenced 
the seeding enough to put Florida 
in the situation to make it to the Elite 
Eight. Then again maybe the seeding would have been the same regard-
less, and the outcome as well.
