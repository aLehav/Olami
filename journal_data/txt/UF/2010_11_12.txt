Fire◗ Florida midfielder 
Erika Tymrak and the 
Gators soccer team will 
host Mercer tonight at 6 in the first round of the 
NCAA Tournament. 
See story, page 15. 
How unique is Florida’s three-quarter -
back offense?
Five men with a combined 151 
years of coaching at the college level or higher 
could only provide one example of ever seeing 
it before.
“I think Red Hickey and the San Francisco 
49ers did that back in the early ’60s,” South 
Carolina coach Steve Spurrier said. “Other than 
that, I’ve not seen three of them go at it.”
For Vanderbilt coach Robbie Caldwell, ESPN 
analyst and former coach Lou Holtz, and UF 
coach Urban Meyer and offensive coordinator 
Steve Addazio, last weekend was the first time 
they’d seen a three-quarterback rotation.
The Gators used John Brantley, Trey 
Burton and Jordan Reed in a 55-14 win against 
Vanderbilt, a move that morphed an often dull 
and predictable scheme into a highly unusual 
— and unproven — attack.
“I’m an old man, and I’ve never heard of 
anybody playing three quarterbacks in a game as part of their system,” said Holtz, 73, who coached for 43 years before retiring.
Florida figures to do the same against the 
Gamecocks on Saturday, and the new game plan means as much work for UF as it does con-
fusion for opponents.
The Quarterback Shuffle
It’s easy to affix labels to the trio: the runner, 
the thrower and the dual threat.
Burton is the team’s second-leading rusher 
but has attempted just four passes, and two of 
those came on a shovel pass and a jump pass.
Brantley has thrown for 1,616 yards but has 
negative-91 rushing thanks to sacks.
And Reed — hampered by injury early in the year — burst onto the scene against the 
Commodores with 120 yards passing and 84 on 
the ground.
Those tendencies make it easy to predict 
what kind of play is coming based on who takes 
the snap.
“Certainly, we’ll understand when the two 
runners are on the field, and when Johnny 
Brantley is on the field, he’s not as apt to run as the other guys,” Spurrier said.
But it’s not that simple. The trait that really 
makes Florida’s system special is that all three quarterbacks can stay on the field for every play.
Brantley has frequently been used as a decoy 
at receiver, Burton has played at every position 
other than offensive line, and Reed can line up 
at tight end or receiver.
And to enhance the confusion, Meyer and 
Addazio installed a pre-snap rotation where 
Brantley, Burton and Reed can move from full-back or tight end to quarterback as an audible.
That’s done to try and catch a defense off 
guard. If opponents line up in man-to-man to 
stop a running quarterback, Brantley slides be-
hind center and takes the snap in hopes of fac-
ing one-on-one coverage against his receivers.
If a defense comes out ready to stop the pass, 
Burton or Reed can come in and try to break a 
big play running the option.
The Gators debuted that tactic against 
Georgia on Oct. 30 and kept it against Vandy, where it was a headache for Caldwell.
“They step up to the line and Brantley’s back 
there, and all of a sudden they check and move around, and now you have to check your de-fense and it becomes a cat-and-mouse game,” 
Caldwell said. “It puts the defense behind the 8-Ball, so to speak.”
But with two games’ worth of film avail-
able for studying, it’s likely the Gamecocks will 
come to Gainesville prepared for the follow-the-
quarterback routine.
That leaves Meyer’s top objective as finding 
other tricks to keep the defense off balance.
“It’s hard. That’s something we spend a lot 
of time on,” Meyer said. “We’re not coming up 
with new plays. We’re just coming up with ways 
to (confuse opponents). I think our tempo is one 
way, but that question is what we’re spending 
an inordinate amount of hours working on.”
By tempo, Meyer means Florida’s no-huddle 
offense, which allows quarterbacks to switch in and out without substitutions coming from the 
sideline since all three are often on the field to-
gether.
But if defending all that sounds confusing, 
just imagine the task of organizing a practice.
Three’s a Crowd
Meyer has long said he won’t let a player 
perform a task in a game until he’s done it a few 
hundred times in practice, so what to do with these three quarterbacks? 
“You want to maximize every second,” 
Addazio said. “They’re precious, because there are only so many reps in the course of a practice, and the organization of that is something we’ve really had to make sure we have tight. 
“There’s no space that’s unused. You need 
every second of it, for sure.”
Turns out, practice reps are the reason the 
three-man weave wasn’t unveiled sooner. 
Addazio said playing all three was the plan 
in the preseason, but Reed missed 24 of 26 fall 
practices and the season opener due to a ham-string injury, derailing the process.
Once he got healthy, there was still a long 
way to go before the scheme was game-ready.
Brantley, Burton and Reed were all high-
school quarterbacks, but Burton and Reed were moved to other positions upon their arrival at 
UF.
On top of learning new roles like route-
running and blocking, they had to manage the 
offense while also improving their throwing 
skills.
That leaves a lot of room for variation and 
mistakes.
“There’s a lot of minor things you don’t 
think about,” Holtz said. “The starting count — 
everyone has a different rhythm, so you could 
start jumping offside. Then there’s the chemis-
try and guys throwing the ball differently as far 
as spiral or speed. There are a lot of subtle dif-ferences.”
The Three Musketeers
For all their differences, the trio is on the same 
page when it comes to sharing the spotlight.
And that’s perhaps the most impressive part. 
Three players who came to Gainesville hoping to be the next great Florida quarterback have shelved their desires to be “The Man” and ad-opted an all-for-one, one-for-all mentality.
“It’s working because we have some really 
unselfish guys who are really just all for the team and for winning,” Addazio said. “That’s 
very evident. It’s created a level of excitement 
and energy, and it’s been a real positive thing 
for us.”
Brantley , already dealing with the pressures 
of being Tim Tebow’s successor and the talk of UF transfer Cam Newton’s success at Auburn, hasn’t uttered a word of complaint.
Instead, he’s been complimentary of his fel-
low quarterbacks.
When Burton burst onto the scene with six 
touchdowns against Kentucky, Brantley con-gratulated him and said his offense needed someone like Burton to run the option.
Then, when Reed threw a touchdown on 
his first-career pass against Vandy — a Tebow-
esque rocker-step strike to Deonte Thompson 
— Brantley pointed out to reporters that Reed 
made the play without a single warm-up throw 
before the game.
“You can expect that out of John,” Meyer 
said. “It would be different if we had that 240-pound tailback that was a Heisman candi-date. That doesn’t exist here right now. It would 
be different if some other things were going on 
that we could be more manageable for what he is perfect at doing. 
“His objective is to help Florida win. … That 
tells you the character of him and his family be-cause I am sure he is just taking shots across the bow.”
If Brantley is bothered by the situation, he 
doesn’t show it publicly. He praises the new of-
fense for reversing the team’s struggles, main-
taining a steady hand as the team’s leader.
“I still need to lead this team, even though 
I’m not taking all the snaps, and that’s fine with me,” he said.Now comes the matchup that will put the 
system — and maybe Brantley’s mindset — to 
test.
It’s one thing for the three quarterbacks to 
light up Vanderbilt but quite another to suc-
ceed against South Carolina with a berth in the 
Southeastern Conference Championship on the 
line.
Will the new idea book a trip to Atlanta or be 
reduced to bad science?
Will someone fall flat and be bounced from 
the game plan, or could one seize the offense for 
good?
Is this a solution or a means to one?“I don’t think they feel like one guy is defi-
nitely the best way to go,” Spurrier said. “When 
I played two quarterbacks, I always said they 
both have their talents and similar ability , so the 
best way to win the game is play both of them. 
“I’m sure that’s the way the Florida coaches 
look at it: To win the game, they have to play all 
three of them.”
Indeed, all three will play Saturday. But 
Meyer stressed that there’s no open competition for the starting gig.
That, he says, is all Brantley’s.
“Johnny is our quarterback. The other guys 
are tempo,” Meyer said. They’re curveballs and 
things we’ve done here in the past. You’ll see a 
lot of tempo, and you’ll see a lot of curveballs.”Editor Anthony Chiang    ◗  Cover Photo Matt Tripp and Alexander Silva

UF BASKETBALL

The Gators got their man.
With the start of the fall nation-
al signing period for basketball, five-star shooting guard Brad Beal 
signed his national letter of intent 
Wednesday.
Despite speculation in recent 
months that the Gators could lose Beal, the No. 7 overall recruit in the nation signed with Florida during a ceremony at his school, St. Louis Chaminade Prep.
At 6-foot-3, 170 pounds, Beal is 
the highest-rated player to sign with Florida under coach Billy Donovan since Rivals.com started ranking 
basketball players in 2001.
“Clearly , I feel like we signed one 
of the best guards in the country ,” 
Donovan said. “We’re extremely ex-cited about adding Brad, we believe he’s a special player and a winner, and we’re excited that he’s going to be a part of our program.”Shortly after signing, Beal Tweet-
ed, “I’m officially a Gator!”
He cited the 
system that UF runs as his rea-son for choosing Florida, saying it suits his style of play and adding that he thinks the program is on the 
rise again.
Beal is the first to sign with Flori-
da’s 2011 recruiting class, and along with Rutgers transfer Mike Rosario, 
he’ll add depth next season to a team 
that has relied heavily on guards Er -
ving Walker and Kenny Boynton.
In July, as a member of the USA 
under-17 basketball team, Beal was 
named the most valuable player of the FIBA U17 World Champion-ships in Hamburg, Germany , after averaging 18.3 points per game and shooting nearly 50 percent from 
three-point range.
In the gold medal game, Beal 
shot 5 of 9 from beyond the arc en route to a 19-point, five-rebound 
performance that helped Team USA win the inaugural tournament.
Beal, who plays AAU ball for the 
St. Louis Eagles, is the second UF player to come from that team, join-
ing former Gator and current NBA 
forward David Lee.
Considered a dynamic scorer 
for his shooting range and ability to drive to the hoop, Beal can also step up on defense. In eight games at the FIBA tournament, he totaled 18 steals.

� MATCHUP COMES IN FIRST ROUND 
OF PRESEASON WOMEN’S NIT.
By MATT WATTS
Alligator Writer
 
Ever since coach Amanda Butler took the 
helm at Florida, the expectations surround-
ing her team have been clear: win a national championship. With six new players and only two return-
ing starters, that goal seems a bit lofty this sea-son. 
Fans won’t know if the if the Gators can 
compete with the nation’s best until March, but Saturday’s season opener against Central Florida should provide a glimpse of their po-tential. The youthful Gators open the season against a veteran UCF squad in the O’Connell Center at 4 p.m. in a first-round Preseason Women’s NIT matchup. “The win is obviously most important,” 
Butler said. “But you’d like to see your team win in a certain fashion. It’ll be all new. I’m sure there will be some moments that won’t be pretty.”
The Gators are coming 
off Butler’s worst season in 
her short tenure as head coach. Last season UF managed a 15-17 record and fell to Miami in the second round of the NIT. 
The Gators missed out on the NCAA Tour -
nament after qualifying the previous year, Butler’s second with the team. 
In order to start this season with a victory, 
the Gators must defeat a Knights team that returns all five starters and whose core has played more than 90 games together. In con-
trast, the starting five that take the floor for 
Florida will be playing its first game together as a unit.

� HE FILED RESTRAINING 
ORDERS AGAINST TIM TEBOW, BARACK OBAMA AND JESUS CHRIST.
By MIGUEL A. CHATELOIN
Alligator Contributing Writer
Saying he feared for his life, 
John D. Gilliand requested re-
straining orders last week against 
three men whom he believes are out to get him: Barack Obama, Tim Tebow and Jesus Christ.
Gilliand,  claims he’s been 
stalked, threatened and assault-ed by each of them, according to Alachua County Records.
Regarding UF’s former star 
quarterback, Gillian wrote in his petition to the court, “I am con-
stantly being harassed by mem-
bers of this per -
son’s school as 
well as fans of 
his school.”
He claims the 
Christian de-
ity, the football player and the 
president of the 
U.S. use gang violence to harass 
him. 
“I feel as though Jesus is a 
gang leader using music, food [and] sex to buy gang members and has physically had me as-saulted on two occasions at my place of employment,” Gilliand 
said.
Police officers outside the for -
mer Alachua County courthouse 
said they’ve seen Gilliand come 
in several times last week and be-
lieve he is homeless.
 They declined further com-
ment.
His petitions were denied.
But while Jesus was let off the 
hook, Gilliand has filed an affida-
vit to ask the court to reconsider his request for a restraining order 
against the president and Tebow.Man files strange request

It was an afternoon that otherwise would have gone 
unnoticed in the quiet, southwest corner of Gainesville. 
But to one family, every passing minute was painful and significant. 
“He was a good son,” Debra Peace said Wednesday 
about her son Anthony Hall. “He loved everybody, and everyone loved him.”
Peace and her family are mourning 
the death of Hall, 37, of Gainesville, who 
was killed on Nov. 4 in a shooting along with his girl-
friend.
A funeral service and burial for Hall will cost Peace 
and her family roughly $7,000 — more than she can af-
ford.  But there’s some help for Peace.

UF’s Hillel is feeling the rhythm 
and blues.
The Jewish Student Union, Black 
Student Union and Alpha Epsilon 
Pi International will sponsor “Gos-pel Shabbat” tonight at UF Hillel. 
The event will include gospel 
song and music interwoven into services by a professional gospel singer, Joshua Nelson, and an ap-pearance by Florida Congress-woman and UF graduate Debbie Wasserman-Shultz.
Shabbat is a Jewish holiday cel-
ebrated at the end of every week from sundown on Friday to sun-down on Saturday. It is considered the “day of rest.”
Keith Dvorchik, executive di-
rector of Hillel, said Nelson, also 
known as “The Prince of Kosher 
Gospel,” is a black Jew who has performed around the world for presidents, congregations, music 
festivals and Oprah Winfrey.
The event is an opportunity to 
combine gospel music and Jewish 
prayer into a unique experience that will showcase a type of non-
traditional service, he said. 
Free Shabbat services and prayer 
will begin at 6:30 p.m. and a free ko-
sher dinner will be served at 8 p.m in the dining room.
Nelson, who is also Hillel’s arts 
intern,  is well-known in prominent Jewish communities because of his Congresswoman to 
attend gospel eventTebow

March to help babies
Gators March for Babies, a 5K 
walk sponsoring the March of 
Dimes’ effort to prevent prema-ture births and other defects, will take place Sunday at 1 p.m.
The walk will begin and end 
on Turlington Plaza.
The organization’s goal for this 
year is to raise between $75,000 and $80,000, according to Kyle Croft, the overall director of logis-tics for Gators March for Babies.  
Croft said there were about 
700 walkers last year.  
This year, the march team is hoping for 1,000.
“We’re a grassroots organi-
zation,” Croft said. “We rely on our community to raise funds in support of our cause, not just here at UF, but across the coun-try, too.”

A group devoted to raising awareness 
about depression, self-injury, suicide and 
addiction is reminding the world this weekend that “love” isn’t just another four-letter word.
That’s why this Saturday, supporters of 
To Write Love on Her Arms will heed the message of the organization’s name and  literally write the word “love” on their arms.
In honor of To Write Love on Her Arms 
Day, members of the group’s UF chapter will start the celebration a day early on the Plaza of the Americas from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. today. 
Members will raise awareness about 
their mission and provide markers to pass-ers-by who want to write “love” on their arms.
“Basically, if people ask you what it’s 
about, you share the mission of the organi-
zation, and you can share your story with 
them if you feel like you want to,” said president Erin Villani, a UF psychology and sociology junior.
To Write Love on Her Arms was start-
ed in 2006 by a Cocoa, Fla., resident Jamie Tworkowski.
Tworkowski got the idea for the organi-
zation after a depressed friend — who was  prone to cutting her arms and struggling with cocaine addiction — was rejected from a treatment center where she tried to get help. 
Tworkowski blogged about the incident 
and later raised money by selling T-shirts to help his friend get treatment. 
Since then, that single blog post has 
exploded into a global movement to raise awareness, with money going toward treatment in the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia. 
On its website, which focuses heav-
ily on being uplifting, tells viewers: “You 
were created to love and be loved.  You 
were meant to live life in relationship with 
other people, to know and be known. 
“You need to know that your story is 
important and that you’re part of a big-ger story.  You need to know that your life 
matters.”
The anti-suicide movement has even 
hit campuses across the nation — since 
last fall, more than 30 university chapters 
across the country have emerged to get in-volved.
The UF chapter, which was one of the 
first 15 launched across the country, has 
about 40 consistent members and more 
than 100 supporters on Facebook, Villani 
said.
Although the organization does not 
have a financial goal, it hopes to raise 
money over the year to partner with a lo-cal treatment facility and provide funding 
to help those who don’t have the money 
for treatment.
Later this semester, the organization 
plans to hold a workshop with the UF Multicultural Affairs department.
The workshop will address the recent  
suicides in the gay community and pro-mote tolerance among the LGBTQ com-
munity as a whole.
But ultimately, To Write Love on Her 
Arms is a movement to get those suffering 
or coping with their struggles in silence to talk about problems stigmatized by soci-
ety, said Patrick Runfeldt, a UF English 
freshman and first-year member of the 
group.
Runfeldt, 18, was clinically diagnosed 
with depression in seventh grade and said 
he joined the organization because going 
through depression is tough — even more 
so when there’s no one there to talk to 
about it. 
“A lot of people won’t approach these 
subjects,” Runfeldt said. “You can be in a group of 50 people and feel alone — and 
that’s a big problem … [To Write Love on 
Her Arms] is about starting a conversa-tion.”Students to fight depression, suicide with ‘love’
“Basically, if people ask you what 
it’s about, you share the mission 
of the organization, and you can 
share your story with them if you 
feel like you want to.”

 New polling data shows that less than 25 
percent of the on-campus registered voters 
turned out to vote this November in the mid-term elections.  
  Ofﬁ  cials at UF and in Gainesville attributed 
the low turnout to the poor economy and a lack of excitement for candidates’ campaigns.
  The election numbers may also be part of a 
larger presidential midterm trend. 
  “Historically, the student vote has the ten-
dency to peak and valley,” said Alachua Coun-ty Supervisor of Elections Pam Carpenter. 
  V oter turnout is always greater during the 
presidential election, and this is especially pre-dominant in the student vote, Carpenter said.  The Reitz Union, one of the three precincts 
where students living on campus could vote, 
had about a 17 percent voter turnout. The Phil-
lips Center for the Performing 
Arts, another student precinct, had about 22 percent, according to Supervisor of Elections data. 
  This was much lower than the overall 
county turnout, which was about 49 percent. During the last midterm election in 2006, the turnout was about the same for these on-cam-
pus precincts.
  Conversely, in the 2008 presidential elec-
tion, the Reitz Union had almost 87 percent 
voter turnout, and the Performing Arts Center had almost 79 percent.

Gainesville residents struggling with the 
economic recession or a small student budget 
can use a new coupon service to receive 50 per -
cent to 90 percent savings at local businesses.
FlyCoupon, which users can access at fly-
coupon.com, is a coupon service that features a new local business discount every week. Ste-ven Shlagman, a UF graduate and resident of 
both Chicago and Gainesville, started the ser -
vice in Gainesville three weeks ago.Shlagman said FlyCoupon began as a con-
cept to help small businesses that struggle 
with advertising costs, as well as consumers who struggle with a tight budget. 
After a year of success in Chicago, Shlag-
man brought FlyCoupon to Gainesville.
FlyCoupon works with Gainesville busi-
nesses to create discounts that fit the needs of consumers. Every coupon offers at least 50 per -
cent savings and lasts at least three months.
“We feature a little of everything, even 
things that college students can afford,” Shlag-man said. “We had no problem finding busi-nesses that were willing to give out $2.50 cou-pons for $5 worth of food.”
Shlagman says that FlyCoupon is commit-
ted to featuring independent businesses in the Gainesville area. A new discount is featured every week, free of charge, and FlyCoupon splits coupon earnings with the businesses.
“With FlyCoupon, local businesses are able 
to get advertising out there that they don’t have to pay for,” said Shlagman. “If no cou-
pons sell, then that business got free advertis-
ing for a week.”
Customers can sign up to receive daily 
e-mails from FlyCoupon that display which businesses are offering discounts on the site. 
FlyCoupon.com has more than 1,100 sub-
scribers and features more than 62 Gainesville businesses. Website offers more than half off at local businesses
� THE STYLE ATTRACTS 
YOUNG PEOPLE BECAUSE OF THE ENERGY INVOLVED.

Contra dancing, a style of danc-
ing that was first popular in New 
England in the 1700s, is experienc-ing a renaissance fueled in part by 
the energy of America’s youth.
Chelsea Moehlenbrock, a UF 
sophomore, has teamed up with the 
Gainesville Oldtime Dance Society to bring a Contra Dancing Club to UF. 
The club, which will hold its first 
dance in the Rion Ballroom on Sun-day , was created to bring a more 
youthful element to Gainesville’s contra community, said Moehlen-
brock, the club’s founder and presi-dent. There will be an introductory workshop at 3:30 p.m. Sunday, and 
the dance will last from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. It’s free for UF students or $5 
for people under 21 
and $8 for people 21 and older. 
Contra dancing features a live 
band, two rows of dancers continu-ally trading partners and a caller 
guiding the dancers through the patterns. That social atmosphere is one reason Moehlenbrock thinks the style is gaining popularity with younger generations. 
Rules aren’t very rigid in contra, 
and neither are social standards. Jo-Laine Jones-Pokorney , adviser for the Contra Dancing Club and an e-Learning support specialist at UF, said that was the thing she noticed most when she went to her first con-tra dance 13 years ago.
She liked that there was no com-
petitive atmosphere, no stress about being pretty enough and no stress about whether she was moving in 
the right way . 
“We’re here to have fun,” Jones-
Pokorney said, “and if you’re smil-
ing, then you’re doing it right.”
Club hopes contra dancing will gain popularity at UF

Today’s question: Do you feel threatened by Barack Obama, Tim Tebow or Jesus?Monday’s question: Would you ever eat at a strip club?
146 TOTAL VOTES36% YES64% NOGainesville is full of its own animals
If you’ve never experienced a feeding frenzy in the 
savannahs of Africa or in the shark-infested waters 
that surround the state of Florida, luckily our very 
own gem in north central Florida can provide you with a similar experience sans zebras. 
Perhaps it’s a mixture of cheep beer and a dash of de-
hydration, but when night falls on University Avenue, the lions come out to play. 
The scent of greasy pizza lingers, compelling orange-
and-blue-draped intoxicants to scurry and criss-cross traffic looking for their fix. 
After a fair amount of drunken pushing and shov-
ing, pizza is acquired and a natural hunger forces these walking bottles of liquor to transform into ravenous an-
imals as they devour their pizza with the same appetite that a lion has for a gazelle. 
Watching this occur in front of me this week instead 
of inside my television set was surreal. I couldn’t help but wonder: What happened to self-respect? 
I kept telling myself as I watched the maudlin model 
Gator with melted cheese affixed to her face that maybe she just forgot her respect — maybe she left the house 
without it. 
But alas, no. 
Self-respect was as dead as a door nail. 
In fact, as I looked back into the night I realized some 
of these people were all hot messes.
This isn’t to say I haven’t been the main course for 
someone else’s musings on the death of dignity. We’ve 
all had our more animalistic moments.
Everything from Gainesvillians’ behavior to their at-
tire seems recently excessive and unnecessary. 
Like the swan who chose a Tuesday night to wear a 
ball gown to a bar. Seriously? 
Or the angry-looking tiger in shorts and a T- shirt in 
30-degree weather. And of course, Gainesville 
wouldn’t be complete without its 
signature I-just-left-the-library-
with-my-sweats-a-T-shirt-and-
a-Ticonderoga-pencil-holding-
your-hair-and-life-together-as-you-drink-alone-in-a-corner 
hermit. 
If you look miserable in what 
you’re wearing, you probably 
are. And let’s be honest, you’re destroying the feeding 
frenzy environment for everyone else with your Debbie Downer mantra. 
Also, aside from any talks of savannahs, here’s a bit 
of advice for the common Gainesville species. 
And or those fancy ladies on the prowl: Don’t be  ex-
cessively dressed to get drunk and puke all over your -
self. 
Leave your gowns and crystal shoes at home. 
To the angry bear: Dress accordingly to the weather. 
I understand your frat-tastic fraternity’s uniform is the 
classic shorts, polo and flip-flops, but that doesn’t mean 
it will protect you from frostbite. 
Lastly, for the hermit crab library dweller: Just be-
cause your exams make you live in the library, it doesn’t mean you have to look like a library, so leave your 
books, pencils and sweater cape in the car. 
Also, eating that fourth slice of pizza wont help.  
Trust me. Watching our model citizen wipe grease off her face was not fun for anyone. 
Spending the night bar hopping through Gainesville 
is truly the closest I’ll ever get to a Humvee ride through 
Tanzania.

As we all prepare to get blue in the face and just about 
everywhere else for the Saturday night southern show-
down with Spurrier’s South Carolina, we can’t help but be 
thankful to the Thanksgiving gods for inching us closer to 
salvation every day. 
Although Thanksgiving break always feels like a tiny 
November tease with a little more than a week left before 
finals and winter break, we’re happy to take any break 
we get. Like Thursday’s day off for Veterans Day. But we don’t want to start throwing Darts and Laurels just yet, so without further ado, we present you with your very own How-Many-Times-Have-You-Played-With-Your-Thermo-

Darts & Laurels 
As Gators across Gainesville celebrated America’s vet-
erans by using Wednesday night as an extra excuse to stay up late and flood bars and their bloodstreams, we’re glad 
to see so many of them caring about the actual reason 
Thursday was a national holiday. 
So for being all patriotic, getting your Iwo Jima on and 
saving us from speaking German for the rest of our lives, 
the Department of Darts and Laurels would like to ride in 
one of those big tanks and proudly present our veterans  
with a Hey-Thanks-For-Putting-The-Japanese-And-Fas-cists-In-Their-Place LAUREL. 
And what’s worse than fascists? Anarchists. 
Wednesday, tens of thousands of angry, rioting London 
students marched through the British capital vehemently 
opposing proposed tuition increases. 
Good thing no one at UF has to worry about tuition 
increases! And good thing there are no worries about planned mass protests against UF for definitely not pro-posing any such increases!
So, as a precautionary tale, the Departments of Darts 
and Laurels hopes no such violent riots with fires and 
crowds 10,000 deep come to campus. And what’s the best 
way to avert any such happenings, Gators? Abandon talks of block tuition and any more increased tuition.
So, for not heeding examples across the world about 
what happens when tuition increases, we’re throwing a No-One-Has-A-Bright-Future-With-Increased-Tuition DART at the Board of Governors. 
And speaking of dim futures, here’s some good news 
from the steps of the Capitol. 
President Barack Obama’s bipartisan commission on 
reducing the national debt unveiled its some-would-say-politically-provocative plan Wednesday.
The bipartisan plan calls for a gradual 15-cent increase 
in the federal gasoline tax, drastic cuts to military spend-ing, the elimination of certain tax cuts and an increased retirement age for Social Security. The plan, the commis-sion says, would erase about $4 trillion from the nation’s deficit in 10 years.
An increase in gasoline tax, a gradual increase at that, 
would encourage people to drive less, thereby reducing carbon emissions and would provide enormous federal revenue to create that $4 trillion in savings. And when the 
Department of Defense requests a 2011 budget of $708.2 
billion, a few cuts wouldn’t be the worst thing. 
For working together on a plan that will likely never 
get passed with the influx of Tea Party candidates, we’re throwing the commission a Teamwork-Is-Fun LAUREL. 
We hope you look good in blue Saturday, Gators!

Gators hypocritical in Newton scandal
I am neither an Auburn fan nor an Auburn enemy , but the 
hypocrisy of The Gator Nation regarding Cameron Newton is 
astounding. It takes The Gator Nation but a few days to try and crucify him before any facts come out.
If Newton was still at UF and leading the Heisman race, 
Gator fans would be bending over backwards defending him.
Sometimes I wonder if The Gator Nation has lost its mind 
when situations like these arise. If someone at UF leaked New-ton’s academic record, which is in violation of law, it does not speak well of the way our school is supposed to conduct itself.
The only thing that should be investigated is the source of 
the leak because it sets an incredibly bad precedent for confi-dentiality at UF and should make every student incredibly ner -
vous. Like every other scandal with this institution, I’m certain 
this one will be brushed under the rug until it’s forgotten.

4LSUF should make sprinklers more efficient
I understand the importance of watering the sidewalk daily 
to ensure healthy growth, but perhaps the grass should get 
some water as well. Maybe as a sustainable campus, UF could make sure the sprinklers are at least hitting some grass because dodging water by walking into the street seems less than safe.

Protest block tuition Wednesday
Throughout campus the topic of block tuition has been pres-
ent in various events and recent conversations. However, what has been lacking from these conversations is how block tuition will affect students after college. 
By implementing block tuition, taking any fewer than a stu-
dent is basically forced to take 15 credits, as taking any fewer would be a waste of money. As a working student, the usual question came up: Where am I going to get the extra money? 
As an art history major, another thought came up: What will 
my resume look like if I only have classes padding it?
When employers are looking for internship candidates, they 
can get hundreds of applications with the same basic educa-tion, similar classes and overall average GPA. What they use as a determining factor is the activities the candidates have done outside of the required education. 
By spending my time taking 15 credits a semester, I wouldn’t 
be able to dedicate as much time to the organizations that could 
set me apart from my peers. In the end, I might graduate faster, 
but my resume would resemble a sad minimalist painting. 
I urge everyone who cares about their careers after college 
to attend Wednesday’s rally on Turlington Plaza at 12:30 p.m. to sign a petition and say no to block tuition.

The board of Friends of Paynes 
Prairie, a citizen support organiza-
tion for the park, decided at a meet-ing Wednesday afternoon to not take a side about a plan to remove wild 
bison and horses from the park.
Robert Hutchinson, the organiza-
tion’s president, said that members 
could take a stand individually , but it would be best not to have an opin-ion as a group because the organiza-tion is meant to support the park.
“We don’t have a policy-making 
role,” he said.
However, board member Frank 
Saier said at the meeting that the purpose of the organization is to support citizens, not the park staff.
The decision to remain neutral 
came after the Florida Park Service released a draft of a plan to cull the herds of wild bison and horses. The park service has also scheduled a 
community meeting to get public 
input about the plan on Nov . 30 at 7 p.m. at the Doyle Connor Building, 1911 SW 34th St.
The park service has said the bi-
son and horses need to be removed because they could be dangerous if they escaped and the park doesn’t have the money for fences to keep 
them from escaping. Also, they said 
they want to prevent inbreeding.
According to the draft of the plan, 
about 12 older, female American bi-son will continue to roam the 22,000-acre park, but all of the males will be removed. Three to five young, female bison will also be moved into a 150-acre area near the visitor cen-
ter observation tower so visitors can 
easily see them. Currently , about 60 bison roam the park.
“Unfortunately , when you look 
outside and you look over the fence, they aren’t there,” said Florida Park 
Service director Donald Forgione.
Instead of auctioning off the bi-
son, they will be given to whoever 
is chosen to remove them from the park. Park management said it does not yet know who will do the job. 
A similar plan is proposed for the 
wild Florida cracker horses, includ-ing removing all males and putting 
about three females in a 150-acre ob-servation area. Currently , about 30 
horses roam the park.
Horses that are removed from 
the herd will be sold at the annual Florida Cracker Cattle Association 
sale and at local auctions and sales. 
Park management was not sure 
who might purchase the horses but 
said breeders may buy them.
Three older, female cracker cattle 
will also be in the observation area, but the herd of about 45 cattle will remain at Hickory Ranch, the park’s cattle ranch, and will not be affected by this plan. 
The idea of culling the herds 
was first mentioned in a memo that David Jowers, manager of Paynes Prairie Preserve State Park, sent to Forgione in 2008. Forgione was 
promoted to director of the Florida 
Park Service in July, and the intent to reduce the herds was announced in September.
Jowers said there wasn’t a specif-ic example of danger to humans that caused the park to take action.
“It’s just one of those ongoing 
things that keep testing the bound-aries more and more,” he said.
He said he was concerned that a 
bison could wander onto a road and someone would crash into it.
“I expect that someone, some in-
nocent motorist, is going to encoun-ter a bison in the middle of the night because they cannot see them,” he said, “and it’s going to be tragic.”
Kristin Lock, information officer 
for Florida Park Service, said that there were two instances in May in which bison had to be killed after “escaping and charging at park po-
lice.”
However, Yellowstone National 
Park Wildlife Biologist Rick Wallen 
said that, depending on how many bison get out, it can take just one person to get a bison to walk back into park boundaries. The main problem for Yellowstone, which has more than 2,000 bison, is when it has 
to stop traffic when a herd crosses a 
highway , but he said that happens only about two weeks a year.
However, he said managing bi-
son near cities can be difficult.
“Bison are a real challenge for 
wildlife mangers in modern soci-ety,” he said.
Chuck Littlewood, a park vol-
unteer, said he has volunteered for Paynes Prairie for six-and-a-half years, and during that time about three bison got out and were round-ed back into the park’s boundaries.
“I don’t think it’s an ongoing, 
frequent event as they would like to portray it,” he said.
Littlewood said Jowers told the 
Friends of Paynes Prairie board in September there was not enough money to repair fences around the park to keep bison from wandering into neighboring yards.

A young horse stands by as its mother grazes in Paynes Prairie Preserve State Park on Oct. 4, 2009. 
Community group remains neutral on prairie animals
They will hold a meeting on Nov. 30Peace has been an employee since the begin-
ning. 
“We’re one big, happy family there,” Peace 
said, as her quiet, sad expression transformed into a wide smile. 
When the news about the death and Peace’s 
financial situation hit the cafe, the staff want-
ed to help. 
Peace posted a flier in the cafe on Sunday 
asking fellow employees for any financial help 
they could afford to give.
 As of Thursday afternoon, employees of 
the cafe had raised more than $600, according to Jamie Edmondson, a server at the restau-rant.
Stan Given, owner of The Flying Biscuit 
Cafe and other local restaurants, said he would match the final dollar amount raised by the staff.
“You have to do what you can to help,” said 
Matthew Pasciuta, the assistant general man-
ager of the cafe. “That’s what a family does.”
Pasciuta and his wife donated $100 to 
Peace. 
General Manager Lyndsey Wells and her fi-
ance donated $200. 
The wake is scheduled for tonight at Combs 
Funeral Home in Lake City, which is where 
Hall grew up. 
The burial service will be at New St. James 
Missionary Baptist Church, also in Lake City, on Saturday.
Peace worked out a payment plan with the 
funeral home, which will allow her to pay the 
$7,000 in installments. 
The final figure is still a burden, but the fact that friends are helping during the situation comforts her. 
“It is unimaginable how kind people have 
been at a time like this.” Peace said. “There are 
still good people out there in the world.”
Peace doesn’t know how much money she 
has raised so far. 
She posted fliers with her son’s picture 
in a few local churches and passed them out to family and friends who knew and loved Hall. 
Hall, who was in prison for a drug offense, 
was released July 25 and was trying to turn his life around, his mother said. 
He was a father to five children between 
the ages of 7 and 18. Peace said he has a new-born grandson. 
Peace and her family would gladly accept 
any contribution for her son’s funeral. Dona-tions can be sent to Debra Peace, 1101 SW 61st St. Apt. B, Gainesville, Fla., 32607, in honor of 
Anthony Hall. 
Flower arrangements and other gifts can be 
sent to the above address or to Combs Funeral 
Home at 292 NE Washington St., Lake City, Fla., 32055.
When told that The Flying Biscuit Cafe 
raised more than $500 for her family within just a few days, Peace shook her head in dis-belief. 
“They have really reached out to us,” Peace 
said. “I am overwhelmed. I really am.”special talents, Amanda Solomon, 
an anthropology junior, said.
“He’s the only person who does 
what he does,” she said. 
Nelson will bring a key board 
and three backup signers with him from New Jersey to perform dur -
ing combined Conservative and Reform Jewish services. 
Dvorchik said prior to din-
ner Wasserman-Shultz will speak about getting involved on campus and will take questions from stu-dents. 
“It’s a great opportunity to hear 
from a congresswoman and a for -
mer Gator,” he said. “It definitely won’t be a common Friday night.”
Solomon said she hopes the 
event will force students to chal-lenge the stereotypes of Jewish identity.
“You could be anyone,” she 
said. “You could be African Ameri-can and Jewish or white and Mus-lim.”
UF Hillel Program Director Jeff 
Kaplan said that Jews are too often stereotyped into looking a certain way. 
“Jews are not a race,” he said. 
“We’re an ethnicity.”
Kaplan said the Hillel staff is es-
timating an attendance of 200 and  students are encouraged to mingle with Nelson and Wasserman-Shultz during dinner and through-out the night.
“It’s really a once-in-a-blue-
moon-event,” he said.
Andrea James, one of the Shab-
bat and holidays student leaders at UF Hillel, believes that the event will be a good way to show people 
that Judaism can con-nect with different groups of people and have a great celebra-
tion.
Last fall, James attended a Shab-
bat where a professor from Israel spoke about mysticism and Juda-ism. After the event she realized “you don’t have to be traditional to be spiritual.”
She also thinks the kosher din-
ner will be a great way to estab-lish a family environment where people from different cultures and beliefs can come closer.FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 12, 2010 � ALLIGATOR, 9

TEEING OFF WITH ANTHONY CHIANGBy TYLER JETT
Alligator Staff Writer
tjett@alligator.org
 
Like their quarterback situ-
ation, the Gators have been ex-
ercising a three-man rotation on punt returns during practice this 
week.
Cornerback Janoris Jenkins 
and receivers Chris Rainey and 
Andre Debose could all field 
punts this week, coach Urban Meyer said Thursday. Jenkins has 
handled those duties for the bulk 
of the season, returning 14 punts for 108 yards.
Rainey actually entered the 
season as the team’s go-to re-turner, but he has not been used in that role since returning from a five-game suspension Oct. 30 against Georgia. 
Debose returned his first career 
punt last week against Vanderbilt for 4 yards, but he is known for his game-breaking speed, most notably featured on an 88-yard kick return against LSU on Oct. 9.
Last season, senior Brandon 
James handled 33 of the team’s 40 punt returns.
“We really don’t have a steady 
guy,” Meyer said. “That was [James’] job. I think JJ has done admirably. Rainey was our guy for a while. We’ll find out.”Meyer added that he doesn’t 
want to sacrifice Rainey’s ability to block punts. The junior blocked a pair against Vanderbilt, both of which led to touchdowns.
Jenkins given extra year: The 
NCAA granted senior corner -
back Moses Jenkins a fifth year of eligibility. Jenkins played in four games last year before suffering a season-ending concussion against 
Kentucky.
He then suffered an elbow in-
jury in this year’s season opener 
against Miami (Ohio) and did not return until last week.
Injuries: Meyer said RB Jeff 
Demps (foot) will be limited Sat-urday. DT Jaye Howard (ankle) is probable. Debose (ankle) is close to full speed.
POLL RESULTS alligatorSports.orgWe here at the alligatorSports Brand 
Picks Column understand this season 
has been a little underwhelming.
Your beloved Gators started the year 
rather sluggishly , and the most exciting 
player (Cam Newton) has allegedly 
thrown his legacy out the window.
And, as evidence of just how des-
perate we are, alligatorSports football writers Anthony Chiang and Tyler Jett sunk to the lowest of lows: the Baylor Bears and the Texas A&M Aggies. 
T exas A&M (-3) will cover the 
spread because …
The Aggies will win this game big. 
I don’t know the Big 12 like my friend Tyler (a Missouri supporter), but I know this: Baylor will lose two more games this season. It’s a forgone conclusion. 
Baylor has lost twice this season and 
the rule states: “The Bears must lose at least four games every year.”
It’s kind of like the rule involving 
Missouri that reads, “When Mizzou is ranked in the top 10, the Tigers must lose.”  
— ANTHONY CHIANG
Baylor (+3) will break “the rule” 
because...
Please excuse Anthony for all that 
foolishness. He’s not in his right mind. 
He awoke coughing up blood Thurs-
day after getting wrecked during an of-fice flag football game the night before.
But at least you’ve learned not to go 
over the middle, Anthony, and Texas A&M will learn the same thing this Sat-urday against Baylor. 
The Bears will improve to 5-0 in 
Waco, Texas, for the first time since their glory days (Liberty Bowl champs!) 
in 1985. Sic ‘Em!
— TYLER JETT

UF cornerback Janoris Jenkins leads the team with 14 punt returns for 108 yards, but he struggled against Vanderbilt, gaining 13 yards on a pair of returns and failing to field several punts. 
Gators keep punt return job open
And now, ladies and gentlemen, let’s 
get ready to fumble!
Four quarters for the undisputed 
SEC East Championship of the world! 
Introducing first, fighting on the away 
sideline, wearing the garnet-and-black trunks, with a record of 6-3 and two knock-
outs, we have the challenger — the South 
Carolina Gamecocks. 
Fighting on the home sideline, wearing 
the orange-and-blue trunks, also with a re-cord of 6-3 and four knockouts, we have the 
two-time defending SEC East Champion of 
the wooooooorld — the Florida Gators. 
A heavyweight fight, this is not. The Gators used to be one of the big-
gest and baddest national championship contenders around, but recent struggles have forced UF to drop some pounds and fight as a lightweight. 
First Alabama 
knocked out Florida in the first round, de-livering some devas-
tating blows that the 
Gators may not have recovered from until recently. 
After losing to Alabama, UF dropped 
two more bouts in a row at home to LSU and Mississippi State, which ended any hopes of a heavyweight championship — the BCS national title. 
Florida’s No. 1 contender status for the 
SEC East was temporarily in limbo, but a win against Georgia snapped the streak and once again pushed UF to the top in the race to Atlanta. 
The Gators pummeled the Commodores 
in a tune-up fight and now stand ready to face the Gamecocks with a revamped offen-sive attack. 
South Carolina comes into the contest 
after taking a knockout last week against 
Arkansas. 
A split-decision against underdog Ken-
tucky and a technical knockout against No. 
1 heavyweight contender Auburn account 
for South Carolina’s other two losses, which 
helped set up this middling SEC East title fight. 
The Gamecocks are trained by the Gators’ Florida, South Carolina set for featherweight clash

of postgame sex with cheerleaders, Keith isn’t having it.
Within striking distance in second at 49-49 is alligatorSports 
assistant editor Tyler “The Snake” Jett, who did his best Jake Plummer impression Wednesday by playing quarterback with-out cleats and flipping underhanded throws while falling every other play. Just don’t carry on Jake’s legacy in strip clubs.
Orchestrating a third-place threeway at 47-51 is alligator -
Sports editor Anthony “Anarchy” Chiang, who parked his car in the middle of a lane preventing Nashville police from chas-ing down a criminal last weekend. 
Joining Anthony is alligatorSports’ Mike “I was promised 
boobs and fire” McCall, who sprinted out the office when in-formed girls were performing by the parking lot. 
In bed with Mike and Anthony is the Miami Herald’s Joe “How come I kept hearing him on the radio if he was behind bars” Goodman, who asked Lil’ Wayne how many New Or -
leans Hornets games he had been to this season during a one-on-one interview — the day after Weezy F. Baby got out of 
prison.
In fifth with a 46-52 record is alligatorSports’ Kyle “Can’t 
stay off the E!” Maistri, who spends his nights watching clips of 
Chelsea Lately. His justification was even worse: “It all started when I was looking for Justin Bieber interviews.”
Tied with Kyle is The Gainesville Sun’s Edward “At least it 
wasn’t Mike” Aschoff, who’s still icing his ankles after getting shook on a highlight-reel juke by McCall’s little brother, Corey , while playing flag football Wednesday.  
And once again in dead-ass last place with a piss-poor re-
cord of 44-54 is FightinGators.com’s Cody “The TV is for TV , the Internet is for Internet stuff” Jones, who struggled to find bootlegged episodes of “Eastbound & Down” this season.PICKS , from page 14� UF HOSTS MERCER 
TONIGHT AT 6.

Nearly three months into the sea-
son, No. 5 Florida has successfully 
accomplished its first two goals. 
The Gators took the Southeast-
ern Conference by storm, defending their regular-season title for the fifth consecutive season and winning their first conference tournament 
since 2007.
Tonight at 6 against the Mercer 
Bears, Florida begins its quest for its 
final goal: a national championship. 
Driven, confident and united, the 
No. 2-seeded Gators kick off their 
pursuit of national glory by hosting 
one of the East Regions for the first round of the 2010 NCAA Tourna-ment. 
“We’re really excited,” All-SEC 
performer Erika Tymrak said. “The 
NCAAs is what we look forward to all year, and this is what 
we work for all sea-
son.”
Mercer, the Atlan-
tic Sun Conference 
Tournament Champ, is making its first Women’s College Cup appear -ance in the program’s 26-year his-tory and looks to play the role of David.
The Goliath Gators are making 
their 14th NCAA appearance in the program’s 16-year history , hosting a 
regional for the first time since 2008. 
“After a long stretch on the road, 
it’s nice to sleep in our own beds and 
be able to play in front of our great home crowd,” coach Becky Burleigh said. Despite the difference in pro-
grams, the two teams are quite fa-miliar with each other, facing off the 
past three spring seasons with the 
Bears pulling out a 2-0 victory last spring. 
The familiarity has caused the 
Gators to enter the match with a pro-
found respect for their opponent.
“I know they’re good and it’ll be 
a good matchup,” forward Lindsay 
Thompson said. Gators heavy favorites in first round of NCAA Tournament

UF BASKETBALL

After an inauspicious start to his college 
career, freshman center Patric Young has a 
second chance to make a first impression. 
Young recorded just 10 points and five 
rebounds in 37 minutes of exhibition action against undersized opponents, but he’ll have an opportunity to make everyone forget those sub-par performances tonight when No. 9 Florida takes the floor for its season opener against UNC-Wilmington at 7. 
The freshman expects to come out ex-
cited and ready to play after shaking all his nerves during the preseason. 
“I’m pretty ready,” Young said. “I just 
feel like it’s time to play basketball.” 
The 6-foot-9, 245-pound freshman was 
expected to bring a physical presence to the team, and through two exhibition games, he hasn’t disappointed. 
Young has been a force in the paint in 
the early going, taking four charges and 
commanding double teams in rebounding 
situations. “There were a few instances where they 
were doubling me and just probably beat 
me and had me boxed out pretty well,” 
Young said. “But that opened up a lot of opportunities for my other teammates.”
But not every aspect of Young’s game 
has been so positive, as the freshman has 
had issues with fouling and being too ag-
gressive. 
Although he says he fouled out just once 
in his senior year of high school, Young 
was forced to leave the 
team’s exhibition open-
er against Florida Tech after committing five fouls in 20 minutes.  
“I was actually 
shocked we got 20 min-
utes out of him,” coach Billy Donovan joked 
after the game. “I thought he would’ve 
fouled out in 10.”
Donovan has commented numer -
ous times throughout the preseason that Young’s unrivaled aggression has had 
a tendency to put him in foul trouble, al-though he is always sure to add that the freshman’s mentality is a desirable attri-
bute overall. 
Still, that aggression has caused Young 
to attempt to block shots he sometimes 
shouldn’t, which opens up offensive re-bounding opportunities for his opponents. 
“I have to learn to stay on my feet a little 
bit more,” Young said. 
Another area of Young’s game that 
could use refinement is his offense. 
The freshman, who averaged just 13 
points per game in his senior year of high 
school, says he has already made massive 
improvements since joining the Gators. 
“I’m doing a lot better offensively,” 
Young said. “I’ve slowed down. When I 
get the ball I just take my time a lot more, 
and it’s made a whole difference because 
I’m scoring pretty much every time and it’s opening up other opportunities for my teammates just by being a threat down 
low.” 
Freshman guard Scottie Wilbekin is 
also expected to make his regular-season debut tonight. Wilbekin returned to prac-
tice on Tuesday after suffering a neck strain against Florida Tech on Oct. 28.Young hopes for good start to career
former fighter and trainer, Steve Spurri-
er, who will try to guide South Carolina to an SEC title fight for the first time in 
the program’s history. 
The Gators are trained by Urban 
Meyer, who has won three SEC East 
Championship belts in his five years as 
head coach of Florida. 
Meyer also played the role of hype 
man for this not-so-heavily anticipated 
pugilistic showdown, ordering a “blue out” and saying he hopes The Swamp is 
“out of control” when the first bell rings 
Saturday. 
Neither of these fighters are particu-
larly skilled or powerful, but by winning this bout, they will prove that resiliency and heart can go a long way in the ring. 
The Gamecocks and the Gators aren’t 
the traditional heavyweight powers the SEC East is used to producing over the 
last decade, but one of them will leave 
Ben Hill Griffin Stadium with the belt.
