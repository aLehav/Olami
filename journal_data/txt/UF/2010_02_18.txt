Aramark leaders
talk to students
0 THE ALLIANCE PUSHED
FOR A WAGE INCREASE.
By JOEY FLECHAS
Alligator Writer
No promises were made as
corporate representatives from
Aramark met with members of
the Student/Farmworker Alli-
ance Tuesday to discuss the treat-
ment of Immokalee workers, who
pick tomatoes for Aramark.
The members of the alliance
presented the demands of the Co-
alition of Immokalee Workers to
the Aramark representatives.
The two alliances want Ara-
mark to pay an extra penny per
pound for the Immokalee toma-
toes it purchases.
The money would be passed
directly to workers as a wage in-
crease.
The alliance also wants Ar-
amark and the Coalition of
Immokalee Workers to create a
human rights-based code of con-
duct to ensure fair treatment ofImmokalee workers.
SFA member Richard Blake
said he felt Aramark approached
the meeting as if it was meant to
encourage dialogue rather than
produce concrete outcomes or
promises.
"I think their intention was to
pacify," he said.
In an e-mail, Aramark Vice
President of Corporate Affairs
Rick Martella, who flew from
Philadelphia to speak to the alli-
ance, said he appreciated the dia-
logue he had with the students
but noted that it will take time to
work through these issues.
"I think their intention was
to pacify."
Richard Blake
SFA member
"We clearly understand and
respect the commitment of the
University of Florida SFA and
will reconnect with them directly
in the upcoming weeks to pro-
vide any updates," he said.toRcyoW

Meek to visit campus
By MATT HARRINGER
Alligator Writer
Rep. Kendrick Meek is serious about
involving college students in his cam-
paign for Senate.
The Democratic congressman, who
represents Miami, will be at UF today
and has already visited UF more than
four times since announcing his candi-
dacy. The campaign rally will be in the
Reitz Union, Room 282 at 1 p.m.
Meek will speak about his vision for
the economy and job market for Flori-
da's young college graduates.
Campaign spokesman Adam Sha-ron said students can meet Meek at the
event and will have the opportunity to
ask him questions on Florida issues.
The campaign needs students to col-
lect petitions to put Meek on the bal-
lot and to register new voters, Sharon
said.
If he succeeds, Meek will be the first
candidate for Senate to
On qualify for the ballot byCampus petition in Florida.
Meek is leading the
polls in the Democratic primary for
Senate, and if he wins, he will face ei-
ther Marco Rubio or Gov. Charlie Crist
in the general election.UF ADMINISTRATION
Union approves contract
By MINCH MINCHIN
Alligator Writer
After five years of bargaining with UF ad-
ministration, the United Faculty of Florida at
UF has approved a new contract by a vote
of 491 to 4.
Increased levels of academic freedom and
more generous sabbatical policies are the
two most important aspects of the contract,
said John Biro, the president of the United
Faculty of Florida at UF.
"Faculty will now be able to speak freely
about any university policy, in or out of the
classroom," he said. "Without the fear of ret-
ribution, [professors] are completely free to
speak."
This new policy, which extends beyond
the bounds of free speech laid out in the U.S.Constitution, makes UF one of the most aca-
demically free universities in the country, he
said.
More lenient policies relating to sabbati-
cals, in which professors are paid to research
their own projects outside the university,
could attract high-quality
professors from around
the world to UF, Biro said.- The new contract,
which is more than 300
pages long, will be ratified
by the UF board of trustees
in March and will apply to
Biro about half of the univer-
sity professors.
"I think it's a great contract," said Paula
Fussell, the UF vice president for human re-
source services. "It's good for the university
as a whole."

CNN poll measures chance of Obama's re-election
By CAITLIN E. O'CONNER
Alligator Contributing Writer
A little more than a year after Barack
Obama took office, one UF student is less
than impressed with the president's perfor-
mance.
"He was a hero created by the media,
and the fact that he didn't have that much
experience is starting to show," said Rob
Foss, a UF English senior.
Foss is part of an increasing majority
dissatisfied with President Obama.
A CNN/Opinion Research poll conduct-
ed between Friday and Monday showedthat 52 percent of Americans said Obama
does not deserve re-election while 44 per-
cent said he does.
The poll also showed that Obama's job
approval rating has waned from 76 percent
in February 2009 to 49 percent this month.
The disapproval rating has more than dou-
bled, going from 23 percent in 2009 to 50
percent this month.
Stafford Jones, chairman of the Alachua
County Republican Party, said part of the
issue stems from failed campaign prom-
ises.
He said the country has yet to see Guan-
tanamo Bay close, a drastically improved
economy or the "Don't Ask, Don't Tell"policy repealed.
"He just made a whole bunch of promis-
es he could not possibly keep," Jones said.
But Jon Reiskind, the
chairman of the Alachua
County Democrats, said
it is too early to judge
Obama's presidency.
He said several factors
have contributed to the
general discontent found
obm in the polls, but the major
factor is the staggering
economy.
While he understands the frustration, he
said Americans cannot expect instant grati-fication.
"The economy is like an enormous ship,"
Reiskind said. "It takes a while to turn it
around."
Reiskind also said Americans tend to
blame the president when things aren't go-
ing well, and Congress, though also criti-
cized, is harder to hold accountable because
it is comprised of many people.
Although he understands the dissatis-
faction, Reiskind said Americans need to be
patient with both Congress and the presi-
dent.
"We don't just need to give him a
chance," he said. "We have to communicate
with him and with our Congress."
65 animals infected with distemper over last six weeks
0 THE DISEASE KILLED 600
DOGS THREE YEARS AGO.
By ASHLEY LARA MOSES
Alligator Contributing Writer
Roommates Rachael Bruce and
Danitza Dragovic are worried about
their dog, Zeus.
Dragovic, a UF health science
freshman, and Bruce, a UF anthro-
pology and English senior, can't
remember whether their 8-year-old
maltese and shih tzu mix has had
his distemper vaccination.After an increase in canine dis-
temper infection in wild animals in
Alachua County, they are planning
their next trip to the vet.
According to David Flagler, the
director of Alachua County Animal
Services, there have been 65 infect-
ed animals reported over a six week
period.
The majority, he said, were rac-
coons, and a few of the cases were
foxes.
Three years ago, a distemper
outbreak in Alachua County killed
more than 600 dogs, according to an
article in The Gainesville Sun.However, currently, there are no
reports of dogs being infected with
distemper in this county.
Distemper is a highly conta-
gious disease that can be exposed in
many ways, said Dr.
Local Catherine McManus,
NewS a veterinarian and
shelter medicine resi-
dent at UF.
An animal that is infected with
distemper can spread the disease
through its secretions, such as mu-
cus, as well as through its vomit and
feces.
McManus said the disease iscommon in animal shelter environ-
ments because many of the animals
that come into Alachua County
Animal Services haven't been vac-
cinated.
Flagler said it's important for
owners to make sure their pets are
vaccinated, and he has advice for
students on a budget.
"I encourage them to buy less
beer and vaccinate their pets," Fla-
gler said.
He said it costs more to treat an
animal that is infected with distem-
per than getting a pet vaccinated in
the first place.
WjI
iJMcManus advises students to
feed pets indoors and to keep a close
watch on them when outdoors, es-
pecially if they haven't been vacci-
nated.
According to McManus, symp-
toms of canine distemper include
runny eyes and nose, depression
and increased fatigue.
As the disease progresses, there
may be gastrointestinal symptoms,
such as vomiting and diarrhea.
If a pet owner has any questions
regarding distemper, McManus
said he or she should contact a vet-
erinarian.

Khambria Clarke, left, Candace Ellis, center, and Marna Weston, right, discuss their experi-
ences in Mississippi at the Civic Media Center Wednesday evening.By ANDREW WYZAN
Alligator Contributing Writer
Khambria Clarke had tears in her eyes
as she spoke to the crowd of more than
30 gathered at the Civic Media Center
Wednesday night.
Along with two other UF students,
Candice Ellis and Mama Weston, she
shared her experience traveling through
the Mississippi Delta to study the civil
rights movement from the people who
lived through it.
"We take for granted so much that we
have today," Clarke told the audience.
"You don't think about being treated less
than human."
The students, members of the Samuel
Proctor Oral History Program, traveled
to Sunflower County in Mississippi in the
summer of 2009 to hear the stories of un-
sung civil rights activists and average resi-"We take for granted so much
that we have today. You don't
think about being treated less
than human."
Khambria Clarke
speaker at Civic Media Center
dents of the South.
"It's only been recently that the civil
rights history in the delta has been told,"
said Paul Ortiz, director of the Samuel
Proctor Oral History Program and leader
of the trip to the delta.
Oritz and the Oral History Program are
planning another trip to the delta this sum-
mer.
The presentation showed audio and
video clips gathered during the trip, which
can be accessed on the oral history pro-
gram's Web site.
UF students express support for renewable energy fee
0 THE FEE COULD FUND
SOLAR ENERGY PROJECTS.
By JOEY FLECHAS
Alligator Writer
Five UF students are in Tallahas-
see this morning to vouch for their
right to vote for a fee that would
support renewable energy projectson Florida college campuses.
They will join 12 other univer-
sity students from across the state to
voice their support for the renewable
energy fee before the Florida Sen-
ate's Higher Education Committee,
which is voting today on a bill that
would grant universities the ability
to implement the fee.
The fee would then need to be
approved by a student vote and the
board of trustees from each Floridapublic university.
The renewable energy fee would
not exceed $1 per credit hour and
would not be covered by Bright Fu-
tures Scholarship Program.
The programsState sponsored by the feeNews could include solar-
and wind-energy
projects to promote energy effi-
ciency, said Chris Cano, Gators for
a Sustainable Campus member andorganizer of the trip.
"Students at individual univer-
sities want to implement the small
fee," Cano said.
According to the Gators for a
Sustainable Campus Web site, the
fee would also allow universities to
buy campus power from renewable
energy providers.
In the spring 2007 UF Student
Government elections, 78 percent of
student voters said they supportedthe implementation of the fee.
UF geography junior Nicole
Motzer traveled to Tallahassee.
She said her plan is to clarify to
the committee that the fee will help
the university save money.
"It will help UF reach its goal
of carbon neutrality," Motzer said.
"Since we spend $40 million on our
utility bill, we could be spending
money on academics rather than
electricity."

Health fair offers resources
By LYN KRAMER
Alligator Contributing Writer
Students walked away with condoms,
candy and concern for their health and safe-
ty after the Student Government Health and
Safety Fair on the Reitz Union Colonnade
Wednesday.
Between 500 and 600 students stopped
by, said Alex Masi, a Unite Party senator
who represents Rawlings Hall.
The SG Health and Safety Fair made stu-
dents aware of the safety resources UF of-
fers and featured tables from the University
Police Department, GatorWell and the Stu-
dent Health Care Center. Students learned
about free bike registrations and a program
offering late-night running partners.
"There are so many great resources on
campus that students don't know about but
should know about," said Severin Walstad,
a member of the Senate Allocations Com-
mittee and a UF freshman.
Organizations that participated in the
event included the Student Health Care
Center, Student Legal Services, Shands at
UF, the UPD, GatorWell, Gator Dining Ser-vices and the Student Safety Research Col-
loquium.
"Raising awareness is always a preven-
tive measure," Masi said. "It brings the
student voice to the people who can help
them."
"I got a lot of free stuff, but I am
also much more aware now."
Wing Yu
UF freshman
Students received more than just back
scratchers, candy, pamphlets, pens, cou-
pons and condoms, Masi said.
"I got a lot of free stuff, but I am also
much more aware now," said Wing Yu, a
UF anthropology freshman.
Sarah Kunkler, a UF finance sophomore,
said it was convenient to have the fair at the
Reitz Union.
She loves being able to go into the Stu-
dent Health Care Center anytime she feels
sick and get quick and easy assistance,
Kunkler said.
"The information is right here," she said.
"It's kind of hard not to check it out."Hateful fliers distributed
By ELIZABETH BEHRMAN
Alligator Writer
Fliers saying "Student Alliance
party is the Nazi Party" were found
on campus bulletin boards and
apartment bus stops Wednesday
morning.
The fliers, which featured a
swastika and are attributed to a
fake group named UF for Israel,
were posted on campus bulletin
boards and apartment bus stops.
Ben Cavataro, the Student Al-
liance candidate for Student Body
president, said he thought the fli-
ers offended most people and he
has no idea who is responsible for
them.
"It's a reprehensible act of hate,
and it has no place on our campus,"
Cavataro said.
He said the Student Allianceparty will not be deterred from its
campaign efforts because of these
fliers.
"If the cowardly people who did
this act think it's going to stop us
from spreading our message, they
are very much mistaken," Cavataro
said.
Senate President Ashton Charles,
the Unite Party candidate for Stu-
dent Body president, said the Unite
Party is not re-
Student sponsible for theGovernment distribution of
the fliers, and she
was disgusted when she heard they
were being passed around.
Charles said passing around the
fliers was a disservice to students
and Gators in general.
"It's not doing anyone any good,
and it's just very upsetting that
someone would do something like
that," she said.

Student's precedent
protects free speech
atherine Evans deserves some recognition, but the usual
two-sentence blurb in the Darts & Laurels won't cut it.
Evans, a UF undergraduate, just helped set a legal prec-
edent.
During her senior year at a public school in Pembroke Pines,
Fla., Evans created a Facebook page to vent about her teacher,
according to an article in The Miami Herald.
In an example of the classroom authorities overstepping
their boundaries, the principal of the school suspended the hon-
ors student and forced her out of her AP classes -two months
after Evans took the page down.
Evans sought to have the records of her suspension removed
via lawsuit on the basis that the punishment was unconstitu-
tional.
Her attempt to stand up for the First Amendment, without
the prospect of an easy reward -the case was opened in 2008
-is commendable.
And U.S. Magistrate Barry Garber's acknowledgment of her
complaint is even more awesome.
Garber's ruling Friday not only cleared the road to removing
the unjust suspension from Evans' record, it also started to lift
the persistent fog of confusion surrounding law and the Inter-
net.
With so many news stories and daytime talk shows about
online bullying, it's understandable why teachers and adminis-
trators might feel the need to intervene in Facebook rants.
The chance of a student becoming depressed or commit-
ting suicide after seeing comments made on the Internet exists.
That's why the authorities pursue people who make threats on
social networking sites.
Police get involved in such crimes, not teachers or admin-
istrators, and even they aren't always sure of how to treat the
situation.
In fact, the legal approach to free speech on the Internet isn't
clear-cut because there are very few precedents to follow.
According to the magistrate's ruling, however, as long as the
comments made aren't lewd or advising illegal activity, they're
protected by the Bill of Rights.
Huzzah, freedom of speech!
The thought of losing the ability to freely criticize others may
not strike fear into the hearts of much of the UF Student Body,
but all 300 million Americans need to understand how impor-
tant the right to speak up is -whether they choose to do so on
the proverbial soapbox or on a digital platform.
Both Evans and the magistrate understood the need to pro-
tect the 200-year-old rights in the modem day, and students
should be happy.
Pupils have always complained about their teachers, and
they always will, no matter the method. Now, however, they
may be protected when making snide comments online.
But the ruling doesn't only affect students. Every American
with access a social networking Web site can take solace in the
possible security of their bitchifests.
For instance, the ruling raises questions about employers'
powers to fire employees simply over job-related complaints on
the Internet.
If the suspension of a student for a page about a teacher
could be deemed unconstitutional, what would stop an em-
ployee from dissing his boss in a status update?
Kudos to you, Katherine Evans.
But in spite of the promise of this case, friending a supervisor
or professor still probably isn't a good idea.

thought nothing had the ability to drag me kickingand screaming away from a television when high-
stakes international curling was on, but the substan-
tial debate surrounding the Student Government elec-
tions at UF this year managed to do the trick.
For the longest time, I thought SG elections for the
fraction of students who were deeply committed bore
a striking resemblance to the relationship I have with
curling. At specific intervals of time, we would get im-
passioned about wholly insignificant things and furious
at people we would otherwise completely ignore or at-
tempt to sleep with.
For all of my professed love for the sport of curling, I
still have absolutely no idea how one gets to handle the
vaunted broom or gingerly slide the big-stone-disc-thingy
for my beloved Belgian curling team. All I really know is
that every four years I get so dang worked up over curl-
ing that I sometimes pass out from a heady combination
of sheer unadulterated joy, virulent anger toward those
bastards who dare to face my Belgian warriors and the
luck-inducing habit of placing a celebratory plastic bag
over my head during especially close matches.
In a similar vein, nobody knows anything about what
SG actually does outside of propping up the entire high-
gloss flier industry in this part of the state. Sure, it is an
excellent outlet for ambitious, type-A personalities who
would otherwise be wasting their time stuck in some
dead-end charitable organization or church group. In
light of recent developments in electioneering at UF,
though, my preconceived notions about the entire world
of SG have been irreparably altered.
Somebody put a bunch of fliers on some cars. I am no
scholar of history, but I struggle to think of a warlord or

dictator who has even come close
to this level of wanton disregard
for the sanctity of the human con-
dition.
I know, it sounds ridiculously
over-the-top and outside the realm
of human decency -but if it hap-
pened in our sleepy, little, college
town, it could happen anywhere.
This threat is real. Maybe where your parents or grand-
parents live, some shadowy figure is crouching in the
dark right now waiting to pounce with shiny paper in
hand.
I don't use the word hero very often, but whatever
brave soul first got seriously worked up about this is the
greatest hero in American history. With this blight on our
very way of life out in the open, a healthy and vigorous
debate has taken place across the pages of this newspa-
per regarding issues that speak to the core of our shared
humanity. And fliers.
Whichever group of earnest and eager go-getters wins
next week will invariably get dressed up in grown-up
clothes and spend millions of dollars, but this most re-
cent development in modern, American politics puts to
bear the efforts of our best and brightest young scions
on some of the contemporary issues that will shape our
changing world. And fliers.
Certain that the future of our country is secure in the
hands of such promising proto-politicians may be sooth-
ing, but it doesn't come close to the sweet calm induced
by my lucky plastic bag.

Unite Party disgusted by negative cam-
paign tactics
Earlier this afternoon I learned of the new
lows campus politics can reach at our univer-
sity. As you may know, our campus was pol-
luted today with a hateful and bitter message.
Fliers were produced containing a symbol
of intolerance that the world turned its back
to more than six decades ago. The Unite Party
does not tolerate these acts and does not stand
for such tasteless propaganda.
These fliers represent bigotry, racism and
hatred -three values that have no place in
our society.
We would appreciate it if the Holocaust
were not exploited in underground and de-
ceptive campaign tactics that turn community
members against one another for the purpose
of political gain.
The pattern we have seen in this election
cycle shows us that some people out there
think negative campaigning can result in suc-
cess at the polls on Election Day.
There are some commonalities found in
both recent flier distributions: They have been
critical of the Unite Party (whether directly or
indirectly), the fliers listed a student organiza-
tion name that does not exist and lastly, the
messages were unacceptable.
Today, we challenge our competitors and
the Student Body to hold themselves to the
highest moral standards. Negative campaign-
ing is bad campaigning. Our Student Body
comes from a variety of backgrounds, and it
is this diversity that makes our campus com-
munity so special.
In the years I have been at this university, I
have never seen something so vile and purely
disgusting take place in Student Government
elections.
I, along with my party, call upon everyone
involved in these elections to condemn this at-
tack and to show that we are, indeed, the lead-
ers of our school.I challenge the Student Body to join me as
we take a united stance against negative cam-
paign tactics and demand more from the po-
litical process on our campus.
Ben Meyers
Unite Party Spokesman
Reader calls out creator of offensive flier
to apologize
On Wednesday a hateful flier was posted in
the Turlington area on the free speech boards.
This flier equated one of the UF Student Gov-
ernment parties with the Nazi Party in Germa-
ny through the use of the swastika symbol.
Comparing the Nazi regime -which was
responsible for the outbreak of World War II
and the murder of more than 11 million civil-
ians -to a student group is offensive and in-
excusable. It trivializes the crimes of the Nazis
and inflicts emotional pain. It minimizes the
sacrifices made by Allied soldiers and the vic-
tims of the Holocaust of all backgrounds.
Simply stated, this flier is hate speech and
has no place on the UF campus. As Americans
and as Gators, we are simply too good to be
involved in this sort of behavior.
The flier is attributed to a group called
UF for Israel. To the best of my knowledge,
no such group exists on campus nor is one
registered with SG. It appears that this is just
another piece of disinformation intended to
cause pain.
I call upon the individual or individuals
who created this flier to apologize publicly. I
would be willing to meet with the author(s)
privately to discuss why this is so offensive.
As a campus that honors and respects the
best traditions of this country, I hope we can
use this as a learning opportunity about hate
speech and the power of symbols. The Gator
Nation must band together to ensure hate
speech is never tolerated.
Keith Dvorchik
Executive Director of UF HillelStudent Alliance party genuinely cares
about student involvement in SG
When Hayley Plant decided to ambush
Ben Cavataro in Wednesday's issue of the
Alligator and berate him for not knowing the
election codes, she forgot to, y'know, read the
election codes.
It's true that door-to-door campaigning is
not permitted on campus. However, door-to-
door campaigning off campus is acceptable,
provided there aren't any signs in plain view
that say "No Solicitors" or anything to that ef-
fect (in Ben's case, there obviously were not).
Fact is, the Student Alliance party remains
the only party on campus that gives a damn
about getting more people involved in Stu-
dent Government. Less than 20 percent of
students vote, and as much as everybody
loves to complain about that fact, Ben Cavata-
ro and his allies are the only people I've ever
seen genuinely try to get people involved.
Campaigning off campus is a great way to
do this, because it allows people to converse
casually and honestly without being in a rush
to get to class. And, sorry Unite, but deploy-
ing freshmen to follow us around on Turl-
ington Plaza and shower us with fake cheer
doesn't count.
I'm talking about genuine -yes, genuine
-effort to involve students in how their tu-
ition is spent. As a former senator and execu-
tive candidate -and long-time colleague of
Ben Cavataro -I can tell you that I still have
never met another person in SG who match-
es his caliber of genuine respect for others,
openness to criticism and honor.
So, Hayley, next time you run into a Stu-
dent Alliance table, ask for Ben and spend
five minutes having a conversation with
him -you'll see what I mean and probably
change your mind.
Stacey Gray
4AGStudent Alliance party's lies about Unite
should be ignored
I was surprised by Wednesday's letter
about how the Unite Party is really the Gator
Party, but perhaps I shouldn't be.
This campaign tagline has been used for
three elections in a row by the Orange and
Blue Party and its successor, but when has
that ever stopped them before?
The Orange and Blue Party and its succes-
sor, the Student Alliance party, have several
canned attacks against Unite. First, they criti-
cize the fact that it has heavy organizational
support from the Greek community, arguing
there may even be a corrupt aspect to this.
The corruption argument is put down by
the fact that Unite has led the most transpar-
ent Student Government in recent memory
and has pledged to continue to work toward
greater transparency.
Orange and Blue Party 2.0 also alleges that
Unite doesn't bring true results to students.
Such a statement completely ignores the fact
that Unite has doubled the size of the SG
computer lab, extended SNAP hours, created
a late-night study center in the Hub, installed
hand sanitizers in the Reitz Union and in-
creased awareness for student safety, among
other accomplishments. Unite's record shows
one outstanding year.
So, we are being told by Student Alliance
party that Unite is actually the Gator Party
that Unite is corrupt and Greeks are a bane to
this campus; and that Unite has not brought
tangible results to students. I also have some
news: Pigs fly, and the sun comes out at
night.
When will we stop hearing the same re-
petitive lies from the Student Alliance party?
We didn't believe it a year ago. We didn't be-
lieve it last fall. We certainly won't believe it
now.

USF professor revisits WWI
By ASHLEY HEMMY
Alligator Contributing Writer
When Gary Mormino asked the crowd of about
45 in Pugh Hall Wednesday night if anyone had
served in World War II, not one person raised a
hand.
Mormino, a University of South Florida history
professor, said the generation of World War veter-
ans is fading.
One of the assignments his students have is to
scan the obituaries every Monday for the deaths
of veterans.
"It's part of remembering and forgetting,"
Mormino said.
Mormino came to UF to speak about the lasting
impact of World War II on the state of Florida. He
discussed the economy, the population, racism,
women and the growing tourism industry during
World War 11.
The screen behind him showed Florida news-
paper headlines, articles and photographs from
the 1940s.
"On the eve of World War II, 1940, Florida was
the smallest state in the American South," Morm-
ino said. "Today, we are a Sunbelt mega-state and
the fourth largest in the union."
The large number of military bases contributed
to Florida's expanding population, Mormino said.I
"Soldiers who came from the Bronx and went
to the Miami Beach base encountered palm trees
and beautiful girls, and they vowed to come back
to Florida one day," Mormino said.
Many soldiers who had worked in Florida bas-
es did return but as tourists or elderly residents.
During 1943 and 1944, UF's football season was
canceled because the male population dropped to
700.
"It's part of remembering and forget-
ting."
Gary Mormino
University of South Florida history professor
After soldiers returned, UF was overflowing
and Florida State College for Women became
Florida State University.
"There was a big change in dependence on fed-
eral money," Mormino said. "Up to that time, little
federal money went to colleges."
When the war ended and soldiers returned,
they also replaced the women in factories and en-
tered universities. The state of Florida increased its
economy, population and tourism industry.
"Florida would have been a big state if not for
World War II," Mormino said, "but it's really hard
to imagine it would have taken the same direc-
tion."Campus radio station
to air Spanish show
By SARAH GIBSON
Alligator Contributing Writer
A UF radio station will launch
its first half-hour Spanish newscast
tonight.
Produced entirely by UF stu-
dents, "Noticias WUFT" will air
on 89.1 from 11 p.m. to 11:30 p.m.
every Thursday.
The idea of a Spanish newscast
at UF began four years ago when a
group of students produced news
podcasts in Spanish, said Amy Jo
Coffey, faculty adviser for "Noti-
cias WUTT." Several students have
continued to develop a Spanish-
only newscast since then.
"I hope that this newscast will
provide an excellent source of in-
formation for the Hispanic/Latino
community in North Central Flor-ida," said Felipe Awad, co-anchor
of "Noticias VvTUFT."
John Wright, dean of the Col-
lege of Journalism and Communi-
cations, approved the newscast for
WUFT-FM after Awad and his co-
anchor Paola Alonzo, pitched him
the idea last fall.
The target audi-
On ence of this newscastCampus is the "Spanish-de-
pendent speaker,"
Coffey said.
The first half of the 30-minute
newscast will focus on local news.
Alonzo and Awad plan to talk
about issues such as immigration
and the economy.
"We are going to be covering
the news and reporting it from a
different angle, from the Hispanics'
point of view and for the Hispanic
audience," Alonzo said.

STUDENT LIFE
Beatboxers draw crowd
By ERIN O'DEA
Alligator Contributing Writer
Dropped cell phones and scraped elbows
were the battle scars of a takeover that hap-
pened Wednesday afternoon, but it was all
for the love of hip-hop.
Breakdancers, beatboxers and rappers rep-
resenting the Hip-Hop Collective drew wan-
dering students to the center of Turlington
Plaza during the second Turlington Takeover
hosted by the organization this semester.
The takeover was meant to promote the
Hip-Hop Collective's A Night of Hip-Hop, a
showcase occurring tonight in the Orange &
Brew.
The Turlington Takeover started at 12:15
p.m. and lasted until 1:30 p.m.
Breakdancer J.J. Richardson, a graduate
student in industrial and systems engineer-
ing, started the show.
He stopped to tell the audience of more
than 50 what hip-hop meant to him.
"This is all love," Richardson said. "It's
about you."
Patrick Wanninkhof, who was wearing
an orange jumpsuit covered in pink balloons
to promote UF's World's Largest Water Bal-
loon Fight Against Breast Cancer, played the
Boston University International Programsdrums.
Throughout the takeover, he found cre-
ative ways to make a beat for the takeover art-
ists: using an empty soda can, an overturned
trash can, a PVC pipe and the balloons on his
own jumpsuit.
"I love music, so it's fun for me," said
Wanninkhof, a UF materials science and en-
gineering sophomore.
Off to the side of the spiraling breakdanc-
ers was a small group of four beatboxers.
Valerie Panting, a UF telecommunication
sophomore and secretary of the Hip-Hop
Collective, was a part of the group.
"I love music, so it's fun for me."
Patrick Wanninkhof
UF sophomore
"We were in the zone, character rapping,
pretending we were rapping in the '80s,"
Panting said.
An onlooker at the takeover could sense
the enthusiasm of the members of the Hip-
Hop Collective.
"They are a diverse group of people, and
they all love it," said Shivani Gogna, a UF
public health and French junior. "They may
not be experts, but they love it."

"It would make everything a lot

'Sexpert' gives advice, tips for a healthier sex life
ByCJ PRUNER
Alligator Writer
For more than 20 years, Sheri
Winston brought babies into the
world.
But on Wednesday, the former
midwife-turned-sexpert, got into
hot and heavy details about how
they're made.
Speaking to about 10 people at
Wild Iris Books, Winston, an in-
structor in "wholistic" sexuality,
discussed how to enhance sexual
performance and erotic encounters.
The discussion was part of a se-
ries on various sexual topics.
"We're all connected to our sexu-
ality. It's an empowering experi-
ence," she said. "For some people,
sex is great, [but] there are always
people who could always be having
better sex."
And for those who struggle in
between the sheets, Winston offered
encouragement.
"If you don't speak French, do
you feel like you're broken?" she
asked the audience, noting how
good sex is a learned skill. "It's noth-
ing to be embarrassed about if you
haven't figured [sex] out."
According to Winston, sex in
western culture has been vilified as
something dirty and taboo.
"I don't know when it happened,but Barbie turned into a slut," she
said.
She said the concept of sex has
been reduced to surface pleasures
instead of its intended purpose of
fulfilling intrinsic human needs."Somewhere along the line, things
got really twisted," said Winston,
who attributed a misunderstanding
of human anatomy and inaccurate
information pertaining to sex. "We
lost what sex is and what it can be."The key to having good sex,
which she called the easiest path to
ecstasy, is to have a good relation-
ship with oneself.
She said keeping a positive out-
look would help ensure healthy rela-
"Wholistic" sexuality educator Sheri Winston speaks about her views of human sexuality Wednesday
night at Wild Iris Books.tionships, both friendly and sexual.
She compared good sex to play-
ing a musical instrument, citing
practice as an integral part to achiev-
ing one's sexual potential.
"Once you've mastered your
musical instrument, you can make
great music," she said.
She advised couples to utilize
subtle approaches to seduction, such
as breath, sound and movement, to
increase their sexual performance.
"Twenty years ago, I thought
multiple orgasms meant like three,"
she said. "Now when I think of mul-
tiple orgasms, I think of dozens and
dozens."
Kylie Slavik and Marcela Marti-
nez, Gainesville residents who are
partners, said the session was very
informative.
"What I liked about it was how
she emphasized how relationships
take commitment and time -it's not
just to have sex but to create an inti-
mate space," Slavik said. "She's pio-
neering new arenas of sexuality."
Winston will be giving classes
at Wild Iris Books Thursday from 7
p.m. to 9:30 p.m. and Sunday from 2
p.m. to 5 p.m. Winston will also be
hosting a class at the Birth Center of
Gainesville on Friday from 6:30 p.m.

The cost of the classes range from
$25 to $50.

For those of you who weren't tuning
into the Opening Ceremonies of the
2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver
this weekend, you missed the wildly
hyped debut of "We Are The World
25 for Haiti." This 25th anniversary
recording featured more than 80 of
today's biggest stars, including musi-
cians and actors. Showcasing the vo-
cals of everyone from Miley Cyrus and
Tony Bennett to Mary J. Blige and Lil
Wayne; the result is astounding.
Another notable recent release was
the "AT&T Team USA Soundtrack" al-
bum, created to benefit Team USA and
the U.S. Olympic Committee. High-
lighting new songs by popular artists
like Rascal Flatts, Sugarland and The
All-American Rejects, these songs are
meant to inspire both American ath-
letes and eager fans watching from
home.
Still looking for more ways to give
back? Yet another all-star song was
released last week to aid relief ef-
forts in Haiti. A remake of "Everybody
Hurts," originally by R.E.M, was orga-
nized by Simon Cowell and also fea-
tures Mariah Carey, Coldplay, Leona
Lewis, Michael Bubl6 and many more.
One hundred percent of proceeds go
directly to Haiti.

library etiquette
Shhhhh.This is a library!
By GABRIELLE FALCONEIRI
avenue writer
It's that time again. Midterms are upon us,
and Gators flood Library West in desperate at-
tempts to cram a half of a semester's worth
of information into three all-night study ses-
sions.
We've noticed a few major faux pas that
plague students' "Club West" etiquette, and
we caught up with Barbara Hood, public infor-
mation officer for Smathers Libraries, for some
advice on how to fix these no-no's.
Talking: Cell phones and excessive con-
versations are the biggest disturbance in the
library, Hood said. When your phone rings
(though it should really be on silent, or at least
vibrate) step into the stairwell to have your
conversation. Also, respect the fourth floor's
designation as the "quiet floor" and don't talk
there. Save the group projects for the study
rooms or the Starbucks caf6 area.
Food: Just because Library West allows
food doesn't mean you should bring in a seven-
course meal while you study. Tryto keep things
simple, keeping in mind that your neighbormay not want to smell your triple garlic pep-
peroni pizza for the next few hours. Anything
that is going to stain the carpet or upholstery
is a no-go as well. Would you want to sit in
semi-hardened chocolate pudding remains?
We didn't think so.
There are plenty of off-campus locations
open late where you can set up camp. Karma
Cream, located on University Avenue, stays
open until midnight Monday to Thursday and
until 2 a.m. Friday and Saturday. It also offers
free Wi-Fi. They also serve a variety of good-
ies that include vegan ice cream and fair-trade
coffee. Another staple for off-campus studiers,
the campus branch of Target Copy not only
provides around-the-clock study spots but has
plenty of food options to keep you fueled into
the wee hours of the morning.
Whether you're a solitary studier or a group
project guru, carve out your niche as you cram
for next week's midterms. Just please don't in-
terrupt the other people around you to do it be-
cause we still have 300 pages of reading and
hearing the excruciating breakdown of your
Midtown-filled weekend isn't helping us focus.Fratty music scene online

team of pledges under the direction of myself
and our team of fratologists. It only took one
night and a palate of copper tops to complete
[the site]. We used paddles to keep the con-
struction on pace."
A: What's the deal with the Web site? Any
downloading involved?
F: "All music is supplied from playlist.com,
which hosts all songs from other Web sites. No
downloading is involved, just knowledge of in-
ner frat life to mix the best series of songs to-
gether to maximize FPP (frat party potential)."
A: Why so secretive about your identity?
F: "Fratty McFratterson is the Frat Star that
we all strive to be. This site and his commen-tary are a compilation of lifestyles and ideas
that have been passed down for generations
and lived out by thousands. The work put
into this site is the work of many, not one."
A: Album titles like "Bitches Dance," "Let's
Bang" and "Get Big" are not your conven-
tional playlist names. Where do the inventive
titles come from?
F:"Our lives. These titles simply represent
essential parts of a day
in the life of any Frat Star.
Each playlist is expertly test-
ed corresponding to the ac-
tivity described in the title.
Our testing grounds include
house parties, study rooms,
gyms and sorority houses after hours."
A: What if you're not Greek- can you still
use the site?
F: "You don't have to be in a fraternity to be
frat. Fratty McFratterson is the Frat Star in all
of us, whether it takes a fifth of beam or a case
of beer to realize it. Wear fratty clothes, never
have an awkward moment and always stay
fratty. It's for colleges everywhere. Gainesville
is just a good base."S.

Iover and do what he did, or should his
line be put to rest with memories of its
greatnessbeing the only remains?
To understand this question, it's
important to know what McQueen did
for the world of fashion and imagina-
tions. The Alexander McQueen brand
is responsible for Lady Gaga's shoes
in the "Bad Romance" video; for a
line of clothing at Target and a line
of Puma sneakers; for fashion shows
with wolves, fire, robots and ice rinks;
for making bustersr" and initiating
the low-rise pants movement in the'90s; and for causing controversy with
stunts like his 1995 collection dedicat-
ed to the highland rapes by showing
bruisedand bloody models.bMcQueen
was the Tim Burton of the fashion in-
dustry -one of a kind -making him
hard to replace and hard to live with-
out.
"There is something sinister, some-
thing quite biographical about what
I do -but that part is for me. It's my
personal business," McQueen said
in an interview with Sarah
Associated Press
Alexander McQueen's designs stood out to all with sharp silhouettes using bright patterns and cutting-edge innovations McQueen
was found dead of asphyxiation and hanging on Feb 11, just weeks before he was supposed to show at Paris fashion week

Lee Alexander McQueen was more
than a fashion designer. He was an
artist who used the humanbody and
fabrics as his canvas and treated fash-
ion shows as theatrical performances.
As head designer of the Alexander Mc-
Queen brand, he brought fantasy, ab-
normality, romance and darkness to
the fashion world. Now, after his death
on Feb. 11, the question is, what will
happen to his brand? Can anyone take

Mower. "I think there is a lot of ro-
mance, melancholy. There's a sad-
ness to it, but there's a romance in
sadness. I suppose I am a very melan-
choly person."
With the amount of his personality
that he puts in his clothes, and their
mentioned biographical aspect, I don't
think the brand should move forward.
But continuing design and production
without the chief designer has been
done over and over and has led to
great things.
Gabriel "Coco" Chanel, former
chief designer of Chanel, died in 1971.
Although her fashion house didn't
make great strides for the following 20
years, it came back with the hiring of
Karl Lagerfeld in 1981. Lagerfeld has
kept the brand fashion-savvy while not
strayingfar from Coco's original look.
When Christian Dior passed in
1957, his house considered shutting
down, but because it was a large rev-
enue-maker for France many people
wouldn't let this happen. Yves Saint
Laurent was the original replacement
for Dior and to this day the label is still
wonderful and growing.
One of the most recent losses for
the fashion industry was Yves Saint
Laurentin 2008. Previousto his death,
the couture house YSL had been shut
down, but the brand still continues
through Gucci Group.
With all these success stories, may-
be McQueen's brand will live on and
a designer will step up and continue
making his magic.
International-renowned fashion
photographer Scott Schuman, also
known for his blog, the Sartorialist,
wrote about McQueen the day after his
death posing a similar question. Hav-
ing received 205 comments at press
time, it's obvious that fashionistas ev-
erywhere have an opinion.
No matter what happens, McQueen
has made his mark, and it will never go
away.

Crash diets, over-exerc is ing won't get you a beach bod
By ALLISON BANKO
avenue writer
We hate to burstyour fried-chicken-
eating bubble, but Spring Break is a
little less than three weeks away, and
it is taking no prisoners. It will soon be
time to show your friends from home
that your college's football team is not
only betterthan theirs is, butyour body
is also way more bangin'.
Unfortunately, followingthe golden
health rules of eating veggies and bal-
ancing calories have been replaced by
late-night ice cream stints and beer
chugging, thus forcing you to take the
route of crash dieting and over-exercis-
ing to get to that perfect body. Wrong!Stop maxing out your weight at the
gym and eating nothing but celery and
prune juice. The Avenue sat down with
Meaghan O'Dwyer, a personal trainer
certified by Aerobics and Fitness As-
sociation of America and American
Council on Excercise to talk spring
break fitness.
What are the dangers of crash diet-
ing?
Crash diets are counterproductive.
You aren't fueling your body prop-
erly so you are more prone to get ex-
hausted. You aren't getting the proper
energy needed to complete effective
exercises.
What is the biggest fitness myth
out there?People think that they can "spot re-
duce," which is trying to minimize just
one area of the body such as love han-
dles or a stomach pooch. Unfortunate-
ly, where you deposit fat is a matter of
genetics, and exercise has total body
effects -notjust spot treatment.
What are some "go-to" exercises
that are both effective and efficient?
A burpee is an exercise that is the
best "bang for your buck." It works
multiple muscle groups and can be
modified to make it harder or easier.
1. Stand up. 2. Go down into a
plank position. 3. Do a push-up. 4.
Jump back up to a standing position.
Make this exercise easier by p/ac-
ing your knees on the ground duringthe push-up.
Make this exercise more difficult by
lifting one leg off of the ground during
the push-up.
A lunge with an oblique twist also
works several areas. You can easily
use a soup can as a weight for extra
core work.
1. Lunge one foot forward. 2. Twist
your upper body to one side with a
weight or can in hand. 3. Repeat for
the other side.
What are some easy ways to incor-
porate fitness on a daily basis?
Cut down on the amount of driving
that you do. Instead, substitute walk-
ingand cyclingto get around. Because
of the cold weather, doingsmall spurtsof exercise outside duringthe day is re-
alistic. You won't have to change out-
fits because of being too hot or sticky,
so fitting in basic exercises in between
classes is very doable.
We at the Avenue think standard
crunches are a joke. A better way to
get a rock hard stomach is to target
your obliques and abdominals by us-
ing a medicine ball.
1. Start lying on the ground with a
medicinal ball. 2. Take your knees off
the ground so that they form a 90-de-
gree angle. 3. Keepingyour legs at the
angle, sit up into a V position and twist
the medicine ball from side to side
keeping your abdominals engaged
and back straight.

Chatroulette takes Web by storm
By Amelia Harnish
avenue writer
Connected, feel free to talk now. Anticipation, hilar-
ity, disappointment. Next. Disgust. Next. Repeat.
Welcome to the roller coaster that is Chatroulette,
the best, and arguably weirdest, thing to come out of
the Internet in a while.
You simply sign on, and the site connects you to a
random video-chat partner. Click "next" when you get
bored or creeped out, and you're instantly connected
with someone else.
After work last Friday, I came home to my roommates
on the couch, Macbooks in laps the way I left them. Ex-
cept they were wearing scarves as turbans, giant sun-
glasses and way too much makeup, giggling like kinder-
gartners and screeching, "Ew, next!"
Intrigued, I joined them and soon I was dressed like
Lady GaGa chatting with people from Chicago to Mos-
cow, Chile to Connecticut. About every fourth next is a
shot of someone's member, and there's of course the"show tits" requests, but the raunchiness is part of
what makes Chatroulette so much fun.
There's just no telling what "next" will bring -one
chatter was doing what looked like the dirty with a
stuffed raccoon, one was dressed in a full-on furry suit
-but most people were like us, just bored.
We met a Naval Academy midshipman who was
chatting on duty, a redheaded computer engineering
major from Indiana and a man in China who spoke little
English and couldn't, for the life of him, figure out what
"fart" meant. We even met some fellow Gators whose
dingy walls and shoddy furniture we recognized as Raw-
lings dorm.
Like LOLcats and Texts from Last Night, Chatroulette
is a great way to waste time. But there's more to this lat-
est novelty because it shows us humanity in its oddest,
most unfiltered moments. We're thrust randomly into
face-to-face conversation with a stranger, in a setting
stripped of any rules of social interaction, which gives
us the ability to connect with others, to anonymously
act like a fool and to do so without leaving home. It's
everything we love about the Internet.
You may still be weary, but trust me, you'll convert.
Don't expect to make lifelong friends on Chatroulette,
but do take advantage of this opportunity to be abso-
lutely ridiculous.
Here's how:
Dress up. Wigs, fake eyelashes, sunglasses and
scarves are necessary accessories for success in the
realm of Chatroulette. The better the costume, the bet-
ter the reaction, and the easier it will be to start a con-
versation with a faraway stranger.
Make things up. We're all on Chatroulette for the
same reason: to be entertained. Exaggerating, lying and
acting like someone you're not is all part of the game.
Think of this as your show.
Have a gimmick. Ask your partner what his or her fa-
vorite song is and ask them to dance with you to it. Get
out Trivial Pursuit or Balderdash and ask them to play.
Give everyone a chance. Even if your partner isn't
dressed up or he or she looks totally boring, don't
"next" them right away. When there are none of the
regular boundaries, you'd be surprised what someone
may have to say.
Chat in groups. This is the perfect activity for room-
mate bonding. It's more fun to hassle and tease fellow
chatters when you have someone to laugh with. Plus,
for whatever reason, we got "nexted" fewer times when
we chatted together.
And lastly, fear not the masturbators. "Next" that
anonymous penis filling the screen and move on to your
next Chatroulette adventure -unless, of course, you're
into that kind of thing.3K fill O'Dome
for John Legend
By JOEY FLECHAS
avenue writer
Just before 8:30 p.m. Wednesday, John Legend sat behind a
piano in the O'Connell Center and sang a quiet rendition of Bob
Marley's "Redemption Song."
Fansfilled the O'Connell Center to see the six-time Grammy award
winner perform and speak. The show was sponsored by Black His-
tory Month, Student Government Productions and Accent. Legend
was paid $90,000 to speak, accordingto the SG Finance records.
Members from Gators United for Haiti passed out fliers and col-
lected donations at the event. "It was great to speak with [John} and
listen to his enlightening views on the need for educational reform,"
said Aaron Crespin, SGP chairman.
Legend was grateful for the opportunity to speak, noting his ex-
citement over speaking to students.
"I love visiting universities because I see so much potential in the
room," Legend said.

UF looks to avoid late-season letdown
0 THE GATORS WILL TAKE ON AUBURN TONIGHT
AT 7 IN THE O'CONNELL CENTER.
By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
aberry@alligator org
Florida has its back against the wall.
With six regular-season games remaining and its post-
season fate hanging in the balance, UF (17-8, 6-4 South-
eastern Conference) will start the most crucial stretch of
the season with a matchup against Auburn (12-13, 3-7
SEC) tonight at 7 in the O'Connell Center.
"We all know that this is a key moment, and the sea-
son is on the line, basically, with these upcoming games,"
sophomore point guard Erving Walker said. "There's def-
initely more pressure."
The Gators will ease into the six-game stretch against
the Tigers, one of three teams in the SEC with a sub-500
overall record. Auburn's three conference wins have come
against teams with a combined 7-25 record in league play
-Alabama, Georgia and LSU.
UF will have to move on from tonight's game quickly
to play at Ole Miss at noon on Saturday in Oxford, Miss.,
then travel back to Gainesville for a crucial Tuesday night
showdown with Tennessee.
The jam-packed schedule has put a lot of pressure on
UF coach Billy Donovan to prepare his team -a task
made all the more difficult by the Gators' limited rota-
tion.
"Our total focus is on Auburn, but at the same time, as
a coaching staff, you're looking at the physical part down
the road -getting prepared for Ole Miss, getting pre-
pared for Tennessee," Donovan said. "That's a challenge
probably for every coach dealing with depth issues."
After winning back-to-back national championships,
UF has struggled to finish the regular season strong. The
Gators are 9-14 in February and March since 2008, includ-
ing a 2-2 record this month that has skeptics wondering if -
UF is destined for another late-season collapse. Harrison Diamond Alligator Staff
junior forward Chandler Parsons doesn't think so Hrio imn/Afiao tf

Gators use old connections for new hires
UF introduces four assistants
By MIKE McCALL
Alligator Staff Writer
mmccall@a Iligator org
With the Florida coaching staff in
disarray, Urban Meyer and interim
head coach Steve Addazio turned to
old friends to steady the boat.
To replace the four assistants gone
from last year's team, the Gators
brought in Teryl Austin (defensive
coordinator), Stan Drayton (running
backs), Zach Azzanni (receivers) and
D.J. Durkin, four coaches who have
served with Meyer or Addazio in the
past.And they will be counted on to keep
things running smoothly while Meyer
is on his indefinite leave of absence.
"We all know each other, and
we're cut from the same cloth
with the way we approach our
kids, football and our families."
Stan Drayton
UF running backs coach
"We're a small fraternity of people
who have crossed paths," Drayton said.
"There's a bloodline somewhere along
the way where these guys have workedwith each other before.
"We all know each other, and we're
cut from the same cloth with the way
we approach our kids, football and our
families."
Durkin and Azzanni served under
Meyer at Bowling Green, and Austin
worked alongside Addazio at Syracuse
more than 10 years ago.
That connection led to Austin taking
over for George Edwards, who left UF
for the Buffalo Bills just three weeks af-
ter accepting the Gators' defensive co-
ordinator job.
Austin joked about his predeces-
sor's brief tenure at a press conference
Wednesday, saying, "Yeah, I've got to

meet will be
one to watch
have covered a bunch of really excit-
ing games in the three years I have
worked for the Alligator, but still one
of the most exciting events I attended as a
journalist was the Florida-Georgia gym-
nastics meet my first semester covering a
team in 2008.
The Bulldogs return to the O'Connell
Center for the first time since then on Fri-
day, and I suggest you don't miss it.
Even though you might know nothing
about gymnastics, or for that matter even
care about the sport, it won't matter.
When I covered it, the sport was still
new to me, and I had no clue why people
got the scores they did, but I was enter-
tained from start to finish.
The teams were Nos. 1 and 2 entering
the competition, it was being aired on
ESPN2 and neither
team disappointed.
It was not either
team's best perfor-
mance that season,
but in a sport in
Bobby Callovi which the teams are
Bobby's World never even on the
bcallovi@alligator org same apparatus, it
produced as close of
a finish as there can
be in gymnastics.
Florida was forced to count a fall on
the uneven bars, and with how well
Georgia was performing, there seemed to
be little hope for the Gators.
With just one gymnast remaining
to compete on the balance beam for the
Bulldogs, all former Olympian Courtney
McCool had to do was not fall.
Of course, she fell, sending the record-
setting crowd of 10,855 into a frenzy,
which caused the Gators to try to calm
the fans -because apparently cheering
when someone falls is a no-no, for future
reference -and setting the scene for

Brombacher, DeFelice lead Gators to first home win
* THE JUNIOR CATCHER HIT
TWO HOMER VS. DOLPHINS.
By GREG LUCA
Alligator Writer
After a weekend in which the
offense and defense took turns
carrying the load, the Gators were
able to finally put it all together
with a 6-1 win over Jacksonville
in their home opener.
Battery mates Stephanie Bro-
mbacher and Tiffany DeFelice led
the way for UF (4-1).
Brombacher got the complete-
game win, allowing only one run
on two hits while striking out
nine, including the first four bat-
ters for the Dolphins (4-1).
After struggling late in games
over the weekend, Brombacher
retired the opposition in order
from the fifth inning on Wednes-
day, striking out four in the pro-
cess.
"I stayed a little bit more men-
tally focused, especially in the
late innings, to just go out there
and pitch my game instead of get-
ting juiced up and trying to throw
the ball harder because that's not
what I do," Brombacher said.
While Brombacher's mental
focus certainly played a role, her
physical stamina was just as im-
pressive.Despite throwing 109 pitches
in the game, she was as sharp in
the final frame, throwing nine of
her 12 pitches for strikes.
"Anytime you're going
through some struggles in late
innings, it's mostly fatigue, and
fatigue then mentally fatigues
you, too, so I thought she did a
good job coming out strong and
finishing really well," UF coach
Tim Walton said.
DeFelice got the scoring start-
ed in the second inning for the
Gators with a two-run home run
off the left-field foul pole and lat-
er added a solo shot off the score-
board to start the fourth.
The junior catcher's 3-for-3
night really got her season on
track after she went only 2 for
12 in the team's season-opening
tournament.
"I think it was just a lot of
frustration coming out from last
weekend so it was nice I had a
good day. I felt good today," De-
Felice said.
The Gators added a pair of
runs in the bottom of the third
with an RBI single from senior
Francesca Enea, who scored three
pitches later on a double by ju-
nior Kelsey Bruder.
Enea's RBI was her team-lead-
ing 11th, while Bruder's moved
her into second on the team with
four.UF also added an insurance
run in the bottom of the sixth, as
freshman Brittany Walker got her
career at home started on a goodnote with a sacrifice fly to right in which it struggled the most on
that scored pinch runner Lauren opening weekend, leaving only
Heil. four runners on base in Wednes-
Florida improved in the area day's win.

go," and turning away from the
lectern as soon as Edwards' name
was brought up.
Austin and Durkin still don't
have clearly defined roles, as
which positions they handle will
depend on Florida's hiring of
graduate assistants.
Durkin said he will be in-
volved with coaching the special
teams for the Gators, a sign that
Meyer will likely lessen his du-
ties this season, like Meyer said
he would.
Drayton is the team's new re-
cruiting coordinator, and he said
Dade County and the Orlando
area will be his main regions of
focus.
Drayton has the strongest
ties to the Gators' program, as
he held the same position at UF
from 2005-07 before leaving for
Tennessee, then spending a year
at Syracuse.
His departure was less than
amicable.
Heading to a Southeastern
Conference rival didn't sit well
with Meyer, and Drayton later
complained about the way run-
ning backs were used in Meyer's
offense.
Drayton said he and Meyer
patched things up, but the phone
call offering his old job wasn't ex-
pected.
"I would be lying to you if I
said I wasn't surprised," Drayton
said. "But we're grown men. All
that stuff was really blown out of
proportion. The respect we had
for each other was never compro-
mised."
Drayton's return likely means
more playing time for running
back Emmanuel Moody, who
transferred to UF from USC
in large part to work with the
coach.
Drayton praised Moody on
Wednesday for the more physical
style he showed last season.Alligator File Photo
Stan Drayton returned to coach running backs at UF after leaving the
Gators for Tennessee and Syracuse for a year each.
The running backs coach
added that Chris Rainey will
split time between running back
and receiver, taking over the role
Percy Harvin played in Florida's
offense."How can you not take advan-
tage of what Chris Rainey can do
all over the field? We're definitely
going to tap into that," Drayton
said.BOBBY, from page 21
like that one, but this meet was just
one in a recent trend of close meets
between Florida and the five-time
defending national champion.
Excluding last year's meet, the
last five dual meets between the
two have been decided by .5 points
or less, including a tie in 2007.
This year's is setting up to be
another close matchup. The Gators
are ranked No. 4 while the Bull-
dogs are No. 7. The two teams are
averaging total scores within .2 of
each other.
This could also be Florida's best
chance to win since its victory in
2005, which was the only time the
Gators beat the Bulldogs in a dual
meet during Rhonda Faehn's ca-
reer as UF's coach.Courtney Kupets, who is
NCAA's all-time leader in indi-
vidual titles with nine despite only
competing in the NCAA Cham-
pionships three times due to an
injury her junior season, finally
graduated.
Georgia's longtime coach Su-
zanne Yoculan retired after last
season. She racked up 10 national
championships in her 26 years at
the school.
And the Bulldogs enter the
meet with their lowest ranking
since 2005, when they were also
No. 7.
No matter the result, though, it
is sure to be another exciting com-
petition between two perennial
national-title contenders.
Just remember: If someone falls,
don't cheer.

Top-tier SEC teams await
HOOPS, from page 21
before," Parsons said. "You guys might be thinking, 'Here
we go again. It's the same thing as the last two years,' but
we're a much better team. We're more focused, we've been
through it and we have goals that we want to reach."
The obvious goal for the Gators is a return to the NCAA
Tournament, but in order to get there, they will have to do
something they've been unable to do the past few years:
beat top-tier SEC teams in the final weeks of the season.
Many of the squads UF fell to in 2008 and 2009 were
eventual Tournament teams. But Parsons
recognized his team's need to separate
itself from the rest of the bubble teams
if UF wants to avoid a third-straight Na-
Men's tional Invitation Tournament bid.
Basketball "The last two years, it's not like we
were playing slouch teams," Parsons
said. "We were playing good teams that
went to the NCAA Tournament. The biggest thing for us
this year is to find a way to win some of those games so
we can be one of those teams."
While wins against ranked conference opponents like
Tennessee (Tuesday), Vanderbilt (March 2) and Kentucky
(March 7) will boost their chances of making the Tourna-
ment, the Gators can improve their odds by winning the
games they need to -starting tonight.
"Everything's crucial now," Parsons said. "We've got
to see what we're made of."

Toledo ready for return
By ANTHONY CHIANG
Alligator Staff Writer
a chi ang@a Iligator org
Just one year ago, Tommy Toledo was
dealing with the disappointment of missing
the entire 2009 season.
But in Friday's season-opener, the red-
shirt sophomore will get the start for No. 7
Florida.
After undergoing surgery on his right
shoulder for a torn labrum in October 2008,
Toledo was forced to sit out and redshirt.
"It was rough because that was the first
time I really had to sit out and not play," To-
ledo said.
There was a point late in the season where
he could have come back, but Toledo and the
team decided against it.
"I started heating it up a little bit and feel-
ing good again, but I just rested it and took it
easy," he said. "There was no point in wast-
ing a redshirt."
Instead, Toledo listened to the doctor's or-
ders and used the time to learn from the dug-
out. UF coach Kevin O'Sullivan looked at the
time off as an opportunity to teach him the
intricacies of pitching, like the importance of
first-pitch strikes and keeping the ball low in
the strike zone.
"I remember back in high school, I just
went out there and just threw," Toledo said.
"Now, I understand the game a lot more."
He also followed the rehab schedule with-
out taking any shortcuts, which took approxi-
mately 14-16 months in length.
Athletic trainer John Barrett set up a plan
consisting of four phases for Toledo.
First, he worked on improving the range of
motion in his shoulder, then came a strength-ening program, followed by some condition-
ing and finally a throwing program.
But mentally, Barrett wasn't sure if Toledo
was ready at first.
"Sometimes it takes even longer from a
mental aspect, that the athlete believes that
they're back to where they were beforehand,"
Barrett said. " But I think mentally he is ready
to go. I think he's seen glimpses of the way he
wants to throw and the way that he knows
he's capable of throwing."
Toledo started feeling like himself again
when he returned to Gainesville fresh off of
Christmas break.
In spring practice, he
has thrown as fast as 93
mph and stayed on the
same pitch count as the
others pitchers throughout
their scrimmages.
"I feel just as good as
I did when I came in my
Toledo freshman year," Toledo
said.
Not all is back to normal, however.
He has noticed it takes 10 minutes longer
to warm up his arm.
"I just have to do some more running and
arm stretching right before and after and take
care of my arm a little bit more," he said.
"Definitely, it's in the back of my mind."
Toledo won't have much time to think
about the shoulder, though.
He will be able to finally put all of the in-
jury concerns behind him on Friday.
"I didn't want to have him sit the whole
weekend just watching the other guys go
out there," O'Sullivan said. "I just wanted to
throw him right in the mix. He is certainly
good enough, so we'll see what he can do."UF tied for first at SECs
By MATT RUBIN
Alligator Writer
After the first day of the 2010 South-
easternConference Championship Meet,
the Florida swimming and diving teams
are tied for first place.
The women's team is currently tied
with Georgia at 95 points. On the men's
side, the Gators are tied with Auburn at
100 points.
"This is obviously going to be a very,
very close conference meet," coach
Gregg Troy said. "There are a bunch of
great teams with a bunch of good swim-
mers swimming fast times."
After posting the fourth-best score in
the women's 1-meter diving preliminary
round, it seemed senior Kara Salamone
saved her best for last, as she posted a
326.70. More than six points ahead of the
second-place finisher, Salamone became
the first Florida diving one-meter cham-
pion since 2000.
"It's absolutely awesome to win this
event. I've been diving five years, and
to go out on a high note is awesome.
There's been so much preparation and
a lot of hard work, good times and bad
times, even tears," Salamone said. "I re-
ally credit everything to (diving) coach
Donnie (Craine). He's made me into
everything I am as a diver today, and I
couldn't have done it without him."
In the men's 3-meter diving finals,
sophomores Colin Bell and AnthonyLewark placed fifth and seventh, respec-
tively. These finishes helped the men's
team gain crucial points.
"It was an awesome way to start our
night," Craine said. "We had nearly a
perfect day on the boards, and I couldn't
be more proud of our group of divers."
In the 200-yard medley relay, the
Florida women came in third while the
men came in second. The men's relay
team of Omar Pinzon, Conor Dwyer,
Shaune Fraser and Roberto Gomez fin-
ished with an NCAA automatic-qualify-
ing time of 1:25.10.
In the 800-yard freestyle relay, the
Gators women fin-
ished second as the
men placed first.
Shaune Fraser, Brett
Swimming g Fraser, Sebastien
RousseauandDwyer
met another NCAA
automatic-qualifying time, setting a new
Florida and Southeastern Conference
record with a time of 6:15.91. The relay
team finished more than seven seconds
ahead of the second-place team.
"Our men's 800-free relay is the fast-
est in the country right now, and the
women's 200-medley relay is the third-
fastest behind the two that took first and
second tonight," Troy said. "We wish we
could have been a little bit faster in the
shorter relays, but overall we're pleased.
This is only day one of a four-day meet.
We have three days left, and we need to
stay focused and race hard."
