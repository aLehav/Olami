Once chilly turtles
turn toasty at UF
By ANA GONI-LESSAN
Alligator Staff Writer
Some Florida sea turtles are in
need of a Snuggie.
The UF College of Veterinary
Medicine welcomed 14 green sea
turtles threatened by the cold
weather at about 4 p.m. Monday,
bringing the total number of tur-
tles currently residing in UF shel-
ters up to 51.
Brian Stacy, a veterinarian
with UF and the National Marine
Fisheries Service, said dips in
water temperature usually cause
turtles to move to deeper, warm-
er water.
However, some turtles don't
make the move, and state wild-
life agencies and volunteers step
in to rescue them.UF is keeping its rescued tur-
tles in tanks varying in size from
50 gallons to 500 gallons, Stacy
said.
Claire Vaiden, a veterinary
technician and a volunteer for the
College of Veterinary Medicine,
said checking the water temper-
ature in the tanks is vital to the
turtles' health.
If the water is too warm, turtles
will have a hard time acclimating
in the wild, Vaiden said.
Stacy said this winter has been
one of the worst for the turtles.
The turtles cannot tolerate wa-
ter temperatures in the high 40s
and low 50s.
"Everyone who works with
turtles hopes this is a once-in-a-
lifetime event," Stacy said.Ana Goni-Lessan / Alligator Staff

UF campus cozy again
0 UF USED A BACKUP SYSTEM UNTIL
THE SYSTEM WAS RESTORED.
By CJ PRUNER
Alligator Writer
After breaking down prior to the start
of spring classes, UF's cogeneration plant,
which provides heat for buildings on cam-
pus, is up and running again.
"Normal levels of heat are being real-
ized campus-wide at this time," wrote
Sharon Blansett, the assistant director of
housing for research and organizational
development, in an e-mail to dorm resi-
dents Monday.
However, she warned residents that
heat ranges may be lower than previous
levels.
Students who experience temperatures
less than 67 or 68 degrees should complete
online iService maintenance requests,Blansett wrote.
The problem occured when the gen-
erator, a turbine engine located near the
Health Science Center at UF's Progress
Energy cogeneration plant, failed several
weeks ago.
Prior to the engine being restored last
BlansettWednesday, UF had to
use a back-up system that
performed at less-than
optimal standards.
Katrina Sharp, an ag-
ricultural education ju-
nior who lives in Keys
Complex, said she didn't
notice any lack of heat-
ing in her dorm.
However, she said the classrooms were
a different story.
"It was pretty miserable," Sharp said.
"I didn't want to take my jacket off. I actu-
ally preferred the buses because they were
much warmer."Health dept. shut down
7 restaurants in 2009
By TYLER JETT
Alligator Writer
Michael Rosenblatt has been or-
dering from Gumby's Pizza & Wings
about twice a month since moving to
Gainesville in 2008.
Rosenblatt, a pharmacy sophomore
at UF, said he liked the Gumby's em-
ployees and found its pizza to be bet-
ter than that of any other restaurant
in town.
But when he heard that Gumby's,
located at 2028 SW 34th St., tempo-
rarily closed last week after a health
inspector found about 70 dead roach-
es and 18 live roaches in its kitchen,
Rosenblatt decided to hold off on or-
dering from the restaurant until it is
inspected again -and passes.
"Quite frankly, it's kind of disgust-
ing," Rosenblatt said. "If it turns out
they get the problems fixed during
further health inspections, then I'lldefinitely eat there again. But until
then, I'm going to wait."
In addition to roaches, the health
inspector found a dirty microwave
and a buildup of slime in the ice ma-
chine, among other critical violations.
Calls to the owner of the restaurant
were not returned Monday.

reopened the next day,

In 2009, seven local restaurants
temporarily closed, according to the
Florida Department of Business Pro-
fessional Regulation (DBPR) Web
site.
In all seven cases, roaches or ro-
dents were found in the kitchens.

Annual survey details bizarre habits of hotel guests
By SAMANTHA DELGADO
Alligator Contributing Writer
Whether guests are taking full advantage of the
not-so-complimentary items or are caught canoo-
dling with their loved ones in the pool, a recent sur-
vey found a lot more hotel guests have checked their
inhibitions at the door.
Earlier this month, the Novotel hotel chain re-
leased the results of its annual survey that asked its
employees from 30 hotels across Australia and New
Zealand about trends in guest behavior -trends that
surprised some local hotel managers and students.
According to the survey, women are more likely
to leave their room in disarray than men and are or-
dering more pornography than ever.
Continuing the trend in womens' naughty hotel
habits, women are more likely to request hotel mas-
sages from the opposite sex than in previous years.
Men, although better tippers than women, are
more likely to be caught nude while in the hallways.
The survey also found guests of both genders are
reusing towels in an effort to become more environ-
mentally friendly.
Rebecca Allshouse, the front-desk manager at the
Gainesville Cabot Lodge, said in her experience men
have usually been messier than women. AlthoughAllshouse has never seen any guests naked in the
hallways, she said there is an open bar where things
tend to get crazy sometimes.
"It makes for some interesting times," she said.
UF sophomore Zumaly Dixon found it hard to
believe women leave hotel rooms messier than men
do.
"Women come off as cleaner," she said.
Arjun Malhotra, a Santa Fe College student, dis-
agreed. He said women can be messier than men at
times.
However, both students agreed the five-finger
discounts on miniature shampoos, conditioners and
other toiletries that the survey found was increasing
in popularity among women wasn't exactly stealing.
They agreed travel-sized bottles are meant to be
taken.
Novotel also surveyed its housekeepers on inter-
esting items guests left behind in their rooms.
In one of the more interesting results of the sur-
vey, housekeepers and maids reported finding sex
toys, fake limbs, a snake, false teeth and a nun's habit
among other belongings.
Holiday Inn University Center employee Christine
Freese spoke about her experience with hotel guests.
"I've been fortunate not to experience anything
too crazy," Freese said.-more likely toorder the mostexpensive wine

UF ACADEMICS
Web site helps
college hopefuls
By ANDREW NORRIS
Alligator Contributing Writer
Creativity comes easy for Stepha-
nie Evans.
Evans, a UF associate professor of
African-American studies andwom-
en's studies, attended a performing
arts middle school and grew up in a
performing arts family.
She's also spent time mastering
a different art form: The college ad-
missions essay.
The former employee of the
Brown University Admission Of-
fice developed a Web site to help
high school students think outside
the box when writing application
essays.
She said she hopes the site will be
running by the beginning of March,
adding that college students apply-
ing to graduate school can also use
the site for their admissions essays.
The site is part of the NIA State-ment of Purpose Project, which en-
couragesstudentstowriteahaikuand
poem along with their admissions
essay to try to put themselves in a
more creative mindset while writing.
Evans asks students to film them-
selves reciting their poems and es-
says and post the video on YouTube.
She can then add the postings to a
database section on her Web site,
where students can find inspiration
for their own essays and videos.
"It's designed to help them think
critically in structure, creatively in
their choice of career; and it also
stresses the need for editing," Evans
said. Evans said the site also involves
more than creative thinking.
"It's about finding what you need
for academic and career planning to
pick the right major," Evans said.
Evans encouraged UF students
to help with the site.

ment.netStephanie Evans poses for a photo at the Digital Worlds Institute on Monday afternoon.
Low temperatures 'produce' problem for local farmers
They used blankets, heaters, tarps
By MINCH MINCHIN
Alligator Contributing Writer
In the subfreezing Florida weather,
grapefruit groves and strawberry patches
have seen brighter days as record cold tem-
peratures cause a shortage of locally grown
produce in North Central Florida this har-
vesting season.
"I've been in Florida for 20 years, and
this is the worst I've ever seen," said Craig
Smouse, produce manager at Ward's Super-
market, one of Gainesville's largest sellers of
locally produced fruits and vegetables.
Recenttemperatures,whichhave droppedas low as 15 degrees in some of the farmland
surrounding Gainesville, are destroying
even the most well-protected crops.
"The blooms and little pink strawber-
ries that were coming in are all gone now,"
said Greg Rogers, partial owner of Rogers
Farm, a small farm just north of Gainesville.
"We covered them up, but it didn't do any
good."
The cold wasted about $10,000 worth of
strawberry blooms in his patch so far, he
said, pushing back the arrival of the year's
first harvest more than one month.
Farther south, a large portion of the Plant
City strawberry crop has become anotherweather-related casualty.
"We had just started getting some [Plant
City] strawberries for a two-week period,"
"All it takes is one degree, and it
makes all the difference in the
world. Florida isn't made for this
kind of weather."
Jeanette Mullins
owner of Monteocha Gardens
Smouse said. "But they're gone now."
The cold weather is also harming the
citrus crop as orange and grapefruit groves
south of Gainesville experience subfreezing
temperatures.Although his fruit from this year has al-
ready been picked, Gainesville citrus grower
Gene Branch said he does not know if his
trees will still be standing next harvest sea-
son.
Tarps, blankets, heaters and smudge pots
have all been part of Branch's effort to keep
his trees alive and productive.
In addition to citrus and strawberries,
beans, squash, eggplant, cucumbers, pep-
pers and tomatoes grown in central Florida
have felt the freeze.
"All it takes is one degree, and it makes
all the difference in the world," said Jeanette
Mullins, owner of local blueberry farm Mon-
teocha Gardens. "Florida isn't made for this
kind of weather."
Speaker condones condoms
By JOEY FLECHAS
Alligator Writer
Teresa White has no problem standing in
front of a crowd with a fake penis in her hand
and a condom in her mouth.
She did it Monday night as she recounted
a discussion with a prostitute about how to
quickly slip a condom onto an unwilling cus-
tomer before oral sex. When she put the red
condom onto the head of the penis with her
lips, students laughed as the message became
clear.
"You've got to get creative with your safe
sex," she said.
White, 42, held nothing back as she discussed
HIV/AIDS education and prevention at Pride
Student Union's first meeting of the semester.
She has been working for the community for
eight years as a regional minority AIDS coor-
dinator for the Florida Department of Health,
educating those who will listen and getting as
many people tested as possible.
Whether it was discussing proper use of a
female condom in a male anus or joking thatsafe anal sex is one of the best orgasms people
can have, she made it clear that straightforward
dialogue is important when educating people.
Whitney Blake, the union's vice president of
outreach, said the discussion had a great turn-
out and reception.
"I think everyone reacted in a very positive
way," she said.
White engaged the attendees with several
provocative talking points and
On confronted them with questions.Campus She asked whether there should
be a national database with names
of people living with HIV/AIDS and whether
people would want to get tested at nightclubs
and pool parties.
She also made an appeal to students to vol-
unteer and give creative input.
"I guarantee you -your stories and your
ideas will reach the Bureau of HIV/AIDS," she
said.
Afterward, UF sophomore Ricky Carter said
he appreciated White's frank manner.
"I think she has a very good approach to
what she does," he said.Police find man with

0 BREAK-INS AND
CARJACKINGS INCREASE
DURING THE SUMMER.
By ASHLEY HEMMY
Alligator Contributing Writer
Cold weather is keeping crimi-
nals off the streets.
"It's human nature," said Lt.
Steve Maynard, spokesman for the
Alachua County Sheriff's Office.
"Temperatures below 20 degrees
are out of their comfort zone."
According topolice, crime drops
in cold temperatures because there
is less traffic and outdoor activity
during the winter months.
"Real cold weather is a deter-
rent," Gainesville Police Depart-
ment spokesman Capt. Ed Book
said.
Police were busy during win-
ter break when many students
left their apartments and cars
unlocked, which caused theft in
Gainesville to
This past
week, the GPD
h as faced a
murder, armed
robberies and a
Book purse snatching.
However, this
has more to do
with the holidays and students
returning to school and less to
do with the colder weather, Book
said.
"It is hard to figure out the cor-
relation between crime and cold
weather statistically," he said.
"Cold weather may not be the only
cause, but there is a definite rela-
tionship."
Drug-related stings operated
by the Alachua County Sheriff's
Office are rarely scheduled on cold
nights, Maynard said.
"When we go out on a really
cold night, there is no one on the
streets," he said.
Break-ins and carjackings sig-
nificantly increase in the summer
when children are out of school
and parents leave for work.
Alcohol-related crimes do
not rise during the winter in
Gainesville, Maynard said.
The most crimes that are relat-
ed to alcohol occur during football
season.
"When people are leaving bars
at 2 a.m. and it's 20 degrees out-
side, they don't hang around in
the parking lots to fight and start
trouble," Book said.

Sarah Failin
Palin will feel at home
on Fox News
aux-er, Fox News announced today that Sarah Palin
will be added to its list of on-air personalities, and the
Editorial Board can't decide whether to ask, "What the
hell?" or nod knowingly.
Obnoxious accent aside, it's hard to understand how any
self-respecting Republican could look at Palin -whose in-
telligence level has been proven to be just above that of a pile
of pencil shavings -without vomiting, much less listen to
her.
But we suppose self-respecting Republicans aren't really
Fox's target audience, anyway. There's Bill O'Reilly, who
verbally assaults anyone who doesn't wholeheartedly agree
with his irate ramblings -and sometimes those who do.
There's Glenn Beck, who refuses to consider that President
Obama might not be a pro-fascism racist. And now, there's
Palin, who thinks she was sent directly from God to be John
McCain's failure of a running mate.
On the bright side, Palin's appearances are sure to pro-
vide a hilarious alternative to that space where nothing good
is on between "Criminal Minds" and "Intervention." And
we can't wait for the reaction when she tells the mother of
a 12-year-old girl that her daughter shouldn't abort her rap-
ist's baby.
Either way, the decision is probably a good thing. Worst
case, we'll have fun watching Palin stare blankly when asked
about anything besides wolf hunting and the great state of
Alaska. Best case, she cracks under the humiliation and goes
into hiding.
Fox has long had us suspecting the network is either re-
search for Michael Moore's biggest documentary ever or a
cruel prank. But this latest move has us hoping Fox's "fair
and balanced" slogan means its humor is just too sophisti-
cated for us to figure out.
Slumby's
he Editorial Board isno stranger to house-
hold pests -if the rats
living in our ceiling aren't
bad enough, we've recently
developed an ant problem
that won't go away no mat-
ter how many ant bombs we
put around the office.
But our pest sob stories
aside, we had a big prob-
lem when we found out that
Gumby's Pizza & Wings
closed last week due to a
roach problem. We had an
even bigger problem when
we found out seven other
restaurants in Gainesville
closed in 2009 because of
roaches too.
According to the Depart-
ment of Professional Regu-
lation's Web site, one of the
offending restaurants, Buf-
fet City, had more than 200roaches in the kitchen.
To make matters worse,
when they were re-inspect-
ed, the health department
found roaches again.
OK, seriously? In what
world is this an acceptable
way to run a business -es-
pecially one that makes and
serves food.
Customers should be able
to depend on restaurants and
know their food will be free
of E. coli, bloody Band-Aids
and roach droppings.
We're glad to see you
were able to rid your roaches
and re-open. You have a sec-
ond chance now Gumby's.
Don't be a repeat offender
like Buffet City.
Because in the end if you
lose your customers' trust,
it doesn't really matter how
good your Pokey Stix are.

Carpe diem doesn't solve problems
m starting to cringe whenever I hear "carpe diem."
It's not that I think there's anything inherently wrong
with day-seizing. Far from it, in fact, it's often an effective
antidote to dwelling on the past, over-analyzing the present
or being overly cowed by the future. And I know that the
occasional admonishment to seize the day has kept me from
sliding too far into the depths of what I call "fate-sourcing"
-relying, with dubious results, on fate to do things for me
that I should be doing for myself.
But as I get closer to graduation, I'm finding myself feel-
ing increasingly trepid by the notion of entering the real
world -or, more specifically, entering the real world with
no idea what the hell I'm doing. It's not so much senioritis as
it is some drug-resistant super-strain of senioritis -a sort of
anxious apathy laced with some frustration that this whole
"next stage of life" thing doesn't really come with a manual.
And there's the vague embarrassment over the realization
that I really, really wish such a manual existed.
None of this is unique to me, I know. Not only do I have
the entire class of 2010 joining me in plunging into an unsure
future with varying levels of readiness, but people of all ages
and all walks of life, frequently with an assist from a bleak
economy, have been -and will be -plunging into an un-
sure future for a while.
At least anecdotally, when I ask aloud what I'm supposed
to be doing, somebody, without fail, offers some variation of
caree diem," examples of how to go about doing so often
include taking random road trips or talking to more strang-
ers. Nice things, to be sure, but I question how much of that
really constitutes seizing the day.
This sort of thinking creates the impression that what
we're supposed to be doing is creating a list of cool, interest-
ing things that we did -and that feels insubstantial and un-
satisfying, akin to throwing together a bunch of facts, quotes
and statistics into a Word document, double-spacing it and
calling it a thesis.
Living like this is very much a product of our culture. Weuse lists as measurements of success
pretty frequently -from the social
-!7 lists (the names of all the close friends
we keep in our lives) to the profes-
sional lists (a r6sum6 describing our
qualifications and skills -after all, a
Joe Del CV is a list that literally means "course
Ietters@a ligator org of life"). And I just can't believe that
more list-making is what we're all
supposed to be doing.
I don't pretend to know what life is, but I feel comfortable
taking a stab at what it isn't.
It isn't just a collection of degrees, certificates and creden-
tials, framed and neatly hung in the wall of your den.
It isn't just a bank account balance; a promising, well-di-
versified stock portfolio; or a series of increasingly impres-
sive job titles and corner offices.
It isn't just social connections you've made, relationships
you've been in or people with whom you've had sex.
It isn't just a set of countries you've visited, languages
you've learned or travel miles you've logged.
And it isn't just a bunch of cool anecdotes to tell your
friends later to prove that you're living life.
These aren't bad things, but there's a danger in thinking
that they're inherently good, meaningful things. Being in a
relationship, getting a degree, having lots of money, travel-
ing the world -these sorts of things derive their meaning
entirely from context: Why these things are being done, and
what will happen after they're done. Moving without direc-
tion is just as bad as standing still -and that includes caree
diem" -driven road trips.
And that's my problem with caree diem": It answers
"What now?" without answering "Why now?," and that just
reminds me that I don't really have an answer to the latter
either.

Guest column
Dems use double standard on racism
Ns the song from the musical "Avenue Q" states,"Everyone's a little bit racist sometimes. Doesn't
ean we go around committing hate crimes.
Maybe it's a fact we all should face: everyone makes
judgments based on race." I don't care whether you're
black, white, Hispanic, Asian, biracial or multiracial.
At some point in your life, I'm sure you've had racist
thoughts. If you've read this far, you probably agree
(though wish you didn't) or shaking you're head in
outrage because you're a P.C., apologist liberal who's
a closeted racist. For a while now, we've allowed lib-
eral Democrats to define racism. When it benefits them
politically, they'll throw the label at someone, but what
happens when it's one of their own? They quickly ex-
cuse to save the squeaky-clean facade they perpetuate.
The most recent racist comments from a liberal to
leak to the public come from Senate Majority Leader
Harry Reid, who described President Obama during
the campaign as "light-skinned" and speaking "with
no Negro dialect, unless he wanted to have one." If
these comments had come from a Republican, every
liberal media outlet and politician would sink its teeth
into him, and the Revs. Al Sharpton and Jessie Jackson
would go for the jugular and destroy his career. But
our good ole boy Harry? No, certainly not. Democrats
make sure that he quickly apologizes, and the presi-
dent accepts it and says, "the book is closed." And oh,
surprise, surprise, out comes Sharpton saying, "While
there is no question that Sen. Reid did not select the best
word choice in this instance, these comments should
not distract America from its continued focus on secur-
ing health care or creating jobs for its people." Excuse
me, Reverend? That's all you've got? How about call-Jenna Kilic ing it like it is? The only worse
Speaking Out thing he could have said would
have been the N-word.
So the prominent liberal gets a
slap on the wrist for undeniably racist remarks because
it's just as the good reverend himself said, we can't af-
ford to have comments such as these "distract" from
legislation that is being force-fed to America. As long as
the cause is a liberal one, all liberal African-Americans
must swallow whatever anger they feel -that starts
with Obama and Sharpton. That's not principle. If ei-
ther of them truly believed in their efforts to fight rac-
ism, they would not let Reid off the hook so easily.
They need to take their cue from Republican Nation-
al Committee Chairman Michael Steele, who called for
the Reid's resignation. I personally wouldn't call for his
resignation (though I'd love it if it happened) because
"everyone's a little bit racist," and if we went after ev-
eryone who made racist remarks, most people would
be out of a job. However, if Sharpton tries to use his
position to destroy the careers and lives of others (re-
member his work on Don Imus?) then, in principle, he
should do the same to Reid.
Make no mistake about it, when liberals label a per-
son racist, it's all about political gain. (Remember how
Rep. Joe Wilson was castigated for his "you lie" com-
ment -somehow they think it logical to label him a rac-
ist but not Reid.) Liberals I encounter in my own life
do the exact same thing. They're all quick to throw the
label, because it makes them feel morally superior, but
the next time you think of doing it, take a step back and
remember "everyone's a little bit racist," even you.

Protesting church's beliefs makes no sense
The protest that took place outside of the Dove World Out-
reach Center illustrates how the demand for tolerance and ac-
ceptance in today's society goes too far. The protesters have their
beliefs about God and how a religious organization should act,
but the church has its own beliefs. Protesting the beliefs of an-
other group makes little sense to me.
If the church sincerely believes that certain lifestyles and be-
haviors are not what God wants for people, and if their inten-
tions are to simply convey this message, there's nothing intoler-
ant about that. Yes, you may strongly disagree and think their
beliefs are mean-spirited or based on bigotry, but I doubt that
the church goes out and actively persecutes people by physically
attacking or harassing them. Signs and shirts are peaceful and
passive means of stating a viewpoint and do not infringe on an-
other person's rights, even though you may not agree with them.
Therefore, the chruch has just as much right to express their be-
liefs as the protesters.
Tolerance is a good goal for a society such as ours, which is
composed of a diverse group of people. Without it, society would
be constantly undergoing an internal war, and nothing would be
accomplished. But tolerating something does not mean you have
to agree with it or support it. It means you allow it to take place.
The church's actions do not interfere with this from what I can
tell based on the article.

Columnist shows ignorance toward gay marriage struggle
Will Penman's Monday column on same-sex marriage was a
peculiar addition to an Alligator issue that included articles on
the Dove World Outreach Center, gay adoption in Utah and com-
memorations of the civil rights movement. Although self-labeled
as a man who "can't figure out what to think about gay mar-
riage," his mocking ramblings about "not hearing much from the
cousin-marriage people," which also snipe that "it's very impo-
lite at UF to oppose gay marriage, you know," show a trivializing
ignorance toward the struggle of homosexuals to gain acceptance
in contemporary society. Our Student Body's support of LGBTQ
students should not be mocked but cherished in a world where
some nations put those convicted of homosexuality to death.
As he asks, I wish Penman luck making his decision, which he
could probably sit and think about over Martin Luther King hol-
ida weekend. During King's life there were many who saw dif-
ferent-race marriage as an attack on a holy institution defined for
centuries as between members of the same race. There were also
those who kept an open mind but worried that the nation was
rushing into something before it had really thought it through.
If alive then, Penman might have been distracted by a 1950
map showing the 16 states where two persons of different colors
could not legally wed (that would have made same-sex marriage
680 percent more distasteful than same-race marriage.) What he
would then fail to see are the persons on the map who struggle
for civil equality and the basic recognition of their own humanity
as an equal part of human cultural and biological diversity. Sup-
port for same-sex marriage is not found in Internet maps but in
the human conscience. In a time when fewer heterosexuals are
committing to marriage, support for any two people who desire
to back their love with legal commitment should be pouring in
from Christians, cousins and chart-enthusiasts alike.

Students brave cold for tri-annual poster sale

the cold at the Reitz Union poster
sale Monday.
Vendors moved the posters of
movie stars, art prints and land-
scapes inside to the second floor of
the Reitz Union due to the chilly
weather.
They hope to move the sale out-
side to the Reitz Union Colonnade
by Wednesday.
The sale, sponsored by the Reitz
Union Arts and Crafts Center, goes
on every day this week from 9 a.m.
to 6 p.m.
Beth Waltrip, the director of
campus programs, said the Reitz
Union Arts and Crafts Center has
sold posters supplied by the College
Poster Sale Company for more than
30 years.
The company sells posters to
more than 300 universities across
the nation, she said.
UF is one of the top poster-selling
universities, she said.
Waltrip said a percentage of the
proceeds go toward funding Theere s a we range otngs
for students to decorate their rooms,"
said Waltrip,
"There are tons of inspira-
tional and novelty posters."
Meaghan Monaghan
UFjunior
Chris Alexander, a UF alumnus
who has volunteered for about 12
years at the sale, said it includes
more than 1,000 different images.
He said about 90 percent of the
images are $9 or less.
On average, the price of the post-
ers was between $7 and $9.
Meaghan Monaghan, a UF Eng-
lish junior, also volunteered at the
sale.
"There are tons of inspirational
and novelty posters," Monaghan
said.
Students who volunteer for one
hour at the sale get to choose a free

Students browse the posters in the Reitz Union on Monday afternoon. The poster sale will be on the
second floor of the Reitz until Friday.

VIOLATIONS, from page 1
found more than 200 dead roaches.
Buffet City reopened the next day, but
when inspectors arrived at the restaurant
in April, they again found roaches in the
kitchen.
Restaurants in Florida are inspected
twice a year by the DBPR and are forced
to temporarily close if inspectors find a
critical violation -that is, a violation that
could jeopardize the health of a customer.
"Certainly the presence of live roaches
is an immediate health risk to the public,"
said Alexis Lambert, spokeswoman for
the DBPR.
"Quite frankly, it's kind of dis-
gusting. If it turns out they get
the problems fixed during fur-
ther health inspections, then I'll
definitely eat there again. But
until then, I'm going to wait.""
Michael Rosenblatt
UF sophomore
Lambert said most restaurants commit
violations, but rarely do those violations
pose a threat to consumers.
As was the case at Gumby's, inspectors
often return to a restaurant the day after
critical violations were found, Lambert
said. If those violations have been correct-
ed, like they were at Gumby's, the restau-
rant is allowed to reopen.

Gators prepare for showdown with No. 2 Wildcats
By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
aberry@alligator org
Tonight won't be the first time Kenny Boynton has gone
toe-to-toe with John Wall.
Florida's freshman guard played against Kentucky's
first-year phenom before going to UF, splitting four AAU
games with Wall's team while guarding him.
"He's faster than anybody I've ever guarded," Boynton
said. "If he gets the ball and gets going on a fast break, he's
so fast he's going to go right around you. So you have to
stop him before he gets it."
Boynton will get another shot at Wall when the Gators
(11-4, 0-1 Southeastern Conference) take on the No. 2 Wild-
cats (16-0, 1-0 SEC) tonight at 9 in the
O'Connell Center.
Wall has helped turn Kentucky into
one of the nation's top teams and rock-
eted up NBA Draft boards in the process.
ESPN's Chad Ford ranks Wall as theBasketball top prospect for the 2010 NBA Draft, with
Boynton having fallen to No. 74. Boynton
said he made a late push to try to talk Wall into joining him
in Gainesville, recognizing his unique skill set and ability to
get out in transition.
"When he gets the ball in the open court, he's a different
player," Boynton said. "If we get back on defense and make
him settle for a half-court game, I think we'll stop him a lot.
But after a team misses, he catches the ball and pushes it."
Donovan compared the 6-foot-4, 195-pound Wall to a
better version of former Kentucky and current Boston Celt-
ics point guard Rajon Rondo.
"I don't think there's a college point guard out there like
John Wall," Donovan said.
Wall leads the undefeated Wildcats with 17.2 points per
Andrew Stanfill / Alligator Staff game and 7.1 assists per game, and his athletic ability makes

Three leave for NFL
By MIKE McCALL
Alligator Staff Writer
mmccall@alligator org
Three more members of Florida's
talented junior class are headed to
the NFL.
Defensive end Carlos Dunlap
and center Maurkice Pouncey an-
nounced Monday that they'll join
cornerback Joe Haden and tight
end Aaron Hernandez and forgo
their senior seasons to enter the NFL
Draft, and safety Major Wright told
the Miami Herald in a text message
he plans to do the same.
"This is one of the biggest deci-
sions I have ever made in my life,"
Pouncey said. "I am glad that my
brother and I made the decision to
be Gators. God gave us the knowl-
edge, strength and ability to be greatplayers, but it is now time for my
brother and me to part ways."
While Pouncey leaves Gainesville
for a pro career, his twin brother,
Mike, will stay at UF and take over
at the center spot, meaning little will
change outside of
Mike dropping
the "Mi." from
the back of his
jersey.
The Pounc-
eys have been a
mainstay on the
POUNCEY Gators' offensive
line for the past
two seasons, and Maurkice started
11 games as a freshman while Mike
played on the defensive line.

As of Monday night, there weren't any student

some no-shows. I don't know if this will be worth
frostbite, but I do think the Gators have a good
chance to upset one of the country's two remain-country. Just saying.)
Here are three reasons
why Florida could knock off Kentucky tonight:
1. UK isn't as good as its 16-0 record: Yes, the
Wildcats are extremely talented, and John Cali-
pani is one heck of a coach (minus all those re-
cruiting violations, of course). But even he knows
that his team has stumbled at times, including a

Wall's athletic ability poses problems
HOOPS, from page 14
"You definitely don't want to be on an island
guarding John Wall," junior forward Chandler
Parsons said. "That's going to be tough. Thank
God I have four guys behind me."
Part of what has made stopping Wall so dif-
ficult so far this season has been the wealth of tal-
ent around him and his ability to distribute the
ball and make his teammates better.
Junior forward Patrick Patterson averages
16.7 points and 8.1 rebounds per game, freshman
center DeMarcus Cousins puts up 15.4 pointsand 9.4 boards and freshman guard Eric Bledsoe
also averages double-digit points per game (10.3)
while sharing the backcourt with Wall.
First-year Kentucky coach John Calipari has
already led his team to impressive victories over
North Carolina and Connecticut, and UK will be
the best team Florida has faced since it shocked
then-No. 2 Michigan State on Nov. 27 in Atlantic
City, N.J.
"We've been an underdog all season long,"
Parsons said. "We knocked off Michigan State
when they were No. 2. We're not going to go in
there scared at all."
Wright's draft prospects most uncertain

around for the last several years," coach Urban
Meyer said. "They have both provided an unbe-
lievable amount of leadership and energy to our
team. These guys embody the toughness and
physical style of play that we want Florida to be
known for."
Dunlap, the defensive MVP of the 2009 BCS
Championship, led Florida in sacks this season
(nine) and also racked up 10.5 tackles for loss.
His senior season was marred by a DUI arrest
that caused him to miss the Southeastern Confer-
ence Championship, but his combination of size(6-foot-6, 290 pounds) and speed will make him
an attractive draft prospect.
ESPN's Scouts Inc. ranks Dunlap as the No.
21 overall prospect, but while he is a likely first-
round pick, Wright's status is
more uncertain.
As a three-year starter, Wright
a made 165 tackles, snagged eight
Football interceptions and forced four
fumbles, but his choice to leave
early comes as a surprise com-
pared to those of his more elite classmates.
Wright told the Herald in a text message, "I'm
going to the NFL."

close calls came at home. In fact, Cali-
pari currently considers his team's
"record" to be 9-7. I won't go that far,
but it's worth noting Kentucky has
let teams hang around. That being
said, UK has walked onto a floor 16
times and walked off with 16 wins, so
it knows something about scraping
out a W. UF will need to play its best

can do great things when clicking on

loss to VU. The previous game, UF
scored only 62 points in an overtime

Unfortunately, the same game Flori-

back in November. The Spartans are
still ranked in the top 10 (No. 7), and

Texas were the other two). Florida
also had a nationally televised duel
with Syracuse back in December
that the Orange won 85-73, although
it was close until the final minutes.
An interesting coincidence is the
Commodores, the Spartans and the
Orange shot 52 percent against the
Gators. In two of those contests, Flor-
ida lost the turnover battle -and the
game. UF needs to use its press to get
easy baskets. Being at home should
help the Gators weather any early
run, but they won't want to let Wall
run up and down the court. Keep it
close, and anything can happen at the
end.

Gators face toughest defensive test ,
By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
aberry@alligator org
Florida is hoping its defensive
meltdown against Vanderbilt was
just a one-time affair.
With Kentucky coming to town
tonight, UF is looking to rediscover
the defensive mentality that helped
it upset FSU and Michigan State
earlier this season.
And the Gators simply can't af-
ford to guard the undefeated Wild-
cats like they did the Commodores,
who scored 95 points Saturday
-the most by a UF opponent this
season.
"For us to even be in the game,
we're going to have to play de-
fense and rebound," junior forward
Chandler Parsons said. "We have to
compete on the defensive end be-
cause like we've said all year, we're
not afraid of shots not falling.
"We showed that against Van-
derbilt. We just have to put them
both together."
UF will face a unique challenge
against Kentucky, as the Wildcats
rely more on their ability to score in
transition and off the dribble than
a set offense in their new dribble-
drive attack introduced by first-
year coach John Calipari.
With athletic guards well-suitedto score off the dribble and a talent-
ed group of post players, UF coach
Billy Donovan said Kentucky pres-
ents a nearly impossible defensive
matchup for any team in the coun-
try.
"You're probably dealing with
three or four lottery picks on their
team," Donovan said. "There are
not a lot of teams who can throw
that out at you. They're a team that
can overwhelm you with size and
talent."
"You're probably dealing with

Billy Donovan
UF men's basketball coach
Kentucky guards John Wall and
Eric Bledsoe have thrived in the
free-wheeling offense, which re-
lies heavily on the play of its point
guards.
Their ability to shoot, penetrate
or find an open teammate has the
Wildcats shooting 50 percent as a
team and averaging 82.4 points perUK scores 82 points per gamegame.
"When you have guys that can
go off the dribble like that, shrink-
ing the floor, cutting down gaps,
those types of things become very
important," Donovan said. "Ken-
tucky certainly thrives in a spread
floor situation, where the floor is
very open, they can use their one-
on-one ability."
Donovan will look to his team's
press to disrupt Wall, Bledsoe and
the rest of Kentucky's perimeter
players.
The Gators forced just seven
turnovers Saturday, well below
their average of 15.7 turnovers per
game. This week, Donovan ques-
tioned some of his players' deci-
sions on when they chose to trap
the Commodores' guards, as poor
decision-making allowed Vander-
bilt to push the ball up the middle
of the court.
Although the Gators' full-court
pressure hasn't always been ef-
fective at forcing turnovers, it still
serves to keep opponents out of
rhythm offensively -something
UF will have to do to have a chance
against Kentucky.
"The press is always huge for us
for creating turnovers and getting
out in the open floor," sophomore
point guard Erving Walker said.
"I'm sure they'll make some good
plays, but over the course of a game
we can turn them over, too."6
