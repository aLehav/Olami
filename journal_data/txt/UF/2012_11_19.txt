 STILL IN THE HUNT

  On Saturday , the Gators did 
something they hadn’t done in their 
past four games: win without the outcome ever being in doubt. 
  Still, UF was well aware that its 
performance in a 23-0 win against Jacksonville State in The Swamp was not good enough.
  It might have been sufﬁ  cient 
when the task at hand was to de-feat Jacksonville State (6-5, 5-3 Ohio Valley Conference), an FCS oppo-nent. But UF (10-1, 7-1 Southeastern Conference), ranked No. 4 in the lat-
est BCS standings, has to improve 
quickly to beat Florida State on Sat-urday and keep its national champi-onship hopes alive.
  Coach Will Muschamp said his 
offense is still not where it needs to be.
  “(There are) some things we need 
to do better to be more consistent 
offensively as we move forward,” 
Muschamp said. “I know I’ve been saying that. I know that’s a broken record. But we’ve got to get better.”
  Mike Gillislee’s 7-yard touch-down run midway through the ﬁ  rst quarter was the only offensive touchdown for the Gators against the 108th-ranked defense in the FCS. The only team to score fewer than 
23 points against Jacksonville State 
this season is 3-8 Southeast Missouri State. The list of teams that have scored more than 30 points against Jacksonville State this season in-cludes Tennessee-Martin, Eastern Kentucky and Murray State.
  “Of course we wanted to score 
more,” guard James Wilson said. 
“We felt like we were moving the 
ball pretty well, and we’ve just got to capitalize. ... We’ve really got to come through next week and just plan for Florida State.”
  The defense’s touchdown output 
matched that of the offense. Senior linebacker Jon Bostic gave the Gators a 17-0 lead when he intercepted a 
pass from quarterback Marques 
Ivory and returned it 7 yards for a touchdown in the third quarter.
  “(The play was) exactly what we 
practiced, and it was perfect,” Mus-champ said. “Couldn’t play it any better.”Win sets up critical clash

� POLICE ALSO FOUND A 
FAKE ID IN THE ROOM.

The smell of marijuana in 
a UF residence hall led to the 
arrest of a student Thursday night.
University Police arrested 
Charles Mitchell Fullerton, an 18-year-old student from Jack-sonville, after an ofﬁ  cer found marijuana, a fake ID and 28 drug paraphernalia items in his Broward Hall dorm room, ac-cording to a UPD arrest report.
At about 10:30 p.m. Thurs-
day, UPD Ofﬁ  cer Takydra Rob-
inson responded to a call report-ing the smell of narcotics inside 
Broward Hall.
While investigating the 
dorm’s fourth ﬂ  oor, Robinson 
reported smelling burnt mari-
juana coming 
from Room 
444.
S h e 
knocked on 
the door, and when Fuller-ton answered, a “very 
strong smell 
of burned marijuana exited the 
room,” Robinson wrote in the report.
Fullerton consented to a 
search of his room, and Robin-son reported ﬁ  nding marijuana and a false driver’s license.She also found seven smok-
ing devices, four grinders, 13 bags/containers, one joint roller, 
one package of hemp rolling pa-
per, one packet of pipe screens 
and one Smokebuddy air ﬁ  lter, 
according to the report.
Robinson arrested Fullerton 
and took him to UPD headquar-
ters.
Later that night, police 
booked Fullerton into Alachua County Jail.
UPD charged him with pos-
session of marijuana and a false driver’s license, as well as 28 counts of drug paraphernalia possession.
Fullerton was released Fri-
day afternoon.

The UF cheerleaders have been 
grounded.
Cheerleaders and supporters 
took to Twitter on Friday, saying 
the University Athletic Association’s 
marketing department had banned 
them from all tumbling and stunts at practices, events and games.
The decision comes after an Or-
lando Magic cheerleader suffered three vertebrae fractures and a bro-ken rib after falling during a stunt 
at the New York Knicks game Tues-
day.Martin Salamone, assistant athlet-
ics director for the UAA marketing and promotions department, de-
clined to comment on the situation. 
According to a current UF cheer-leader, the UAA instructed team 
members not to speak with the press 
about the ban.
“We know what we do is risky 
and that there is a ‘one in a million chance we might get hurt,’ but that’s 
why we practice,” senior squad 
member Morgan Palmer tweeted as @MorganLPalmer. She ended the 
tweet with the hashtag #Unground-UF stunts cheerleading

� STUDENTS FROM UF,      
FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY AND UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH FLORIDA PARTICIPATED.
JEWEL MIDELIS   
Alligator Contributing Writer
Lorea Arambarri’s white dress 
flowed and beige heels clacked as she 
moved across the wood floors with her dance partner at a beginners’ tango event.
Like Arambarri, about 25 other stu-
dents from UF, Florida State Univer -
sity and University of South Florida gathered at the Gainesville Dance As-sociation Sunday to do what they love — tango.
The FSU biology freshman said de-
spite football, she left the animosity in Tallahassee to attend the social.
“I got over the rivalry thing for tan-
go,” said Arambarri, 18.
She said her best friend is a Gator, 
and she wanted to dance with people from other areas.
“It doesn’t get much better than 
this,” she said.
More than 10 couples at a time tip-
toed and glided across the wood floors, 
dancing to three songs in a row, which 
is known as a tanda.
Trista Brophy , the president of 
USF’s Argentine Tango Club, said the event was designed to teach beginners how to do a milonga, which is a tango social.
“A lot of the students don’t go to 
milongas because they are afraid,” the 27-year-old environmental science and global sustainability graduate student said. “We wanted to just focus on be-ginners to encourage them to dance.”
Kyle Kirwan, 22, the treasurer of the 
UF Argentine Tango Club, said Argen-
tine tango is different from the tradi-
tional ballroom form.
“This tango is not patterned-based. 
It’s all improv,” the UF industrial and systems engineering fifth-year student said. “The leader is the person who puts the dance together.”
Leila Harriss, vice president of FSU’s 
tango club, said she loves so many as-pects of tango.
“It’s so passionate, and it’s all about 
feeling,” the graduate student said. “Dancing is like an expression of some-one.”
November 20, 1962: The south door of the Smathers 
Library facing Peabody Hall was reopened. The door had 
been closed since 1958 for budgetary reasons. Too few students used the south door to justify keeping a book-checker there. The assistant director of readers’ services, 
Margaret Knox, said the door reopened because more 
buildings were being built south of the library.
November 22, 1986: Anticrime group The Guardian 
Angels stopped in Gainesville on its way to the state pris-on in Starke to protest Ted Bundy’s third stay of execu-tion. Members carried signs and covered themselves in ketchup-covered sheets to signify Bundy’s victims. They came in protest of what they considered a miscarriage of 
justice — Bundy’s continued life on death row. 
November 22, 1993: Local antigay rights activists 
gathered about 8,500 signatures for a petition to add a 
measure to repeal Alachua County’s sexual discrimina-tion ordinance to the following year’s ballot. During the previous March, the County Commission had voted to add sexual orientation to the county’s antidiscrimination ordinance. The activists stressed they were not antigay, 
but they believed homosexuality should not be treated 
as a minority group.
November 21, 2003: After a year of transitioning away 
from a charity service, the Krishna Lunch served on the Plaza of the Americas began charging $3 per meal. Since 1971, the Krishna policy was to ask for an optional $3 for the lunch. The Hare Krishnas decided to charge because the mounting costs of providing lunch could no longer 
be supported by the few donations they received. Many 
students boycotted the lunch due to the new cost.

The Gator Cheerleaders pump up the crowd during the football 
game against Jacksonville State University on Saturday. 
The ban was made before Senior Day
UFCheer.
In another tweet, the telecommunication major 
wrote, “This is unreal. This is unreal. This is not hap-
pening. This did not just happen.“
The decision was made just about 24 hours before 
Senior Day, the last opportunity for the fourth-year members to officially stunt in the Swamp.
“Can’t believe I can’t tumble out the team for my 
last home game,” tweeted @TarinMoses, UF recreation 
senior and team captain Tarin Moses. Jason Merslich, 
a 27-year-old former Gators cheerleader, former team coach and still-involved volunteer said the ban was 
“sort of a slap in the face.”
“We do everything for them,” he said. “The only 
time we don’t have anything to do is summer, and we spend it practicing.”
Merslich said a member of the UAA marketing 
department told members of the Orange team about 
the ban just an hour before Friday’s volleyball game against Louisiana State University.
The cheerleaders had to tell the Blue team members 
themselves.
At Friday’s game, Merslich said, team members felt 
“weird” and “silly.” They stood on the sidelines cheer -
ing on their team, their feet on the floor. The situation was similar at Saturday’s football game.
“During one of the timeouts, instead of doing stunts 
or lifts, they all just clapped and stood around,” said 19-year-old aerospace engineering sophomore Kyle 
Krieter. “That’s when me and all the guys I was with 
kind of noticed. They danced a little, too, but that was about it.”
Merslich said safety is the UF coaches’ first prior -
ity and that they adhere to American Association of Cheerleading Coaches and Administrators guidelines.
“The coaches are very serious about it,” he said. 
“When people get hurt, it’s because they’re not follow-ing these guidelines. We never do things at a game that 
we haven’t perfected and practiced.”grounded , from page 1crime

An Alachua County grand jury indicted 
an Alabama man Thursday accused of stab-
bing a Gainesville resident on West Univer -
sity Avenue in October.
The grand jury formally charged Clifton 
Rae Baxter, 33, of Ashford, Ala., with first-degree homicide and robbery with a deadly weapon, according to the Alachua County Clerk of the Court.
The indictment comes more than two 
weeks after police arrested Baxter in Alabama following the Oct. 26 incident.
A Gainesville Police arrest report revealed 
more details to the events that led up to Rob-
ert Dockens’ death and Baxter’s arrest.
At about 10:30 p.m. on Oct. 25, Dockens and his girlfriend were with Baxter in a motel 
room. Inside, Baxter was smoking crack co-caine Dockens had given him on credit.
Shortly after midnight, Baxter left the 
room with Dockens to withdraw money to 
pay for the drugs.
The men drove to the 
ATM at the Wells Fargo bank on North Main Street and the CVS/pharmacy on Southwest 13th Street, but Baxter could not withdraw the necessary cash from ei-ther of the ATMs.
At about 5 a.m., the men 
went to the Bank of America at 1116 W. Uni-
versity Avenue to get money.
A surveillance video showed Baxter and 
Dockens together at the bank’s ATM, police said.
Fifteen minutes later, the video showed 
Dockens bleeding through his shirt.
Additional surveillance videos showed 
Dockens running west on West University 
Avenue and collapsing in front of the Papa John’s Pizza restaurant off Southwest 12th 
Street.
Within a few minutes, Baxter drove his 
van over to Dockens and stole his wallet.
At about 5:20 a.m., a witness called police, 
reporting that Dockens was lying facedown 
on the ground and Baxter was rummaging through Dockens’ pockets.
Baxter fled the scene in his van and went 
back to the motel room. He briefly went into 
the bathroom before leaving again.
Police later searched the motel room and 
found Dockens’ wallet in the bathtub.Meanwhile, an ambulance took Dockens 
to Shands at UF, where he later died from his 
stab wounds.
Through police interviews with bystand-
ers and surveillance videos, detectives pinned Baxter as a suspect.
On Oct. 27, Dothan Police Department and 
the Houston County Sheriff’s Office arrested Baxter in Alabama on a first-degree murder charge, according to a GPD news release.
Police extradited Baxter out of Alabama 
and booked him into Alachua County Jail at 10:18 p.m. on Nov. 1.
As of Sunday night, Baxter remained in 
jail without bond. He is scheduled to make his plea in front of a judge for arraignment 
Dec. 12.

A Santa Fe College cultural 
organization will host an aware-
ness event today to highlight the dire circumstances affecting Syria.
Soul of Syria will be held at 1 
p.m. at SFC’s Northwest campus gym. The event, sponsored by the college’s Arabic Cultural Asso-ciation, aims to educate the pub-lic about the humanitarian crisis that is affecting the country.
“Killing, killing, killing hap-
pening all around the city ,” said 
Omar Al Ajlani, a 25-year-old 
Santa Fe business administration senior and event organizer. “The government is killing everyone.”
The Syrian uprising started 
in March 2011 with people pro-testing for the resignation of President Bashar al-Assad, said Sameer Saboungi, an 18-year-old UF exploratory freshman.  He 
said President al-Assad ordered 
the Syrian army to kill innocent civilians to show the government is superior.
Saboungi, whose parents are 
from Syria, said he used to go there every summer but hasn’t been back in a couple of years be-cause of the violence.
“The government is using 
the army to collectively punish everyone,” he said. “It’s just cold-hearted execution.”
He said these camps are lim-
ited in food and water because they are overpopulated and no one is funding them.
Currently, about 40,000 peo-
ple have been killed from the conflict.
“I see videos on YouTube of 
children dying and corpses just lying in the streets, and some-times I just shiver and cry,” Sab-oungi said.Cultural group sheds

A new learning platform called 
Top Hat Monocle is offering a new 
service to replace classroom click-ers with cellphones.
Top Hat Monocle was created 
to improve student engagement in the classroom and allows students, including those at UF, to text or submit answers on their cellphone, tablet or computer to questions while they are in class, said An-drew D’Souza, chief revenue offi-cer for Top Hat Monocle.
“Students are using technol-
ogy they’re already familiar with. They’re using their own cellphone, their own laptop, tablet or whatev-er. It’s something they’re comfort-able with,” D’Souza said, “and that they don’t ever forget.”
Top Hat Monocle was created 
as a graduate school project by its co-founders Mike Silagadze and 
Mohsen Shahini at the University 
of Waterloo in Canada, D’Souza said.
According to the website, they 
first created Top Hat Monocle as a simple polling system, and it has been evolving ever since.
With the platform, which was 
created in 2009, teachers can con-duct polls or quizzes, run interac-tive demonstrations, upload and share files, and assign homework, 
according to its website.
The use of the different features 
varies by class, D’Souza said. The 
math and science faculties typically 
use the polls, quizzes and interac-
tive demonstrations, while the lib-eral arts faculties use open-ended polls, questions and discussions more frequently.
Among the benefits professors 
have reported are significant im-provements in attendance, reten-tion and grades, he said.
Todd Palmer, UF biology as-
sistant professor, started using Top Hat Monocle in 2011 in his Inte-
grated Principles of Biology II class, 
which has about 900 students.
Since using Top Hat Monocle, 
attendance has increased by about 10 percent to 15 percent, Palmer said in an email.
“It has certainly given me an 
opportunity to establish how well students are grasping particular 
concepts, which in turn allows me 
to rephrase what I’m teaching in the moment,” Palmer said in an email.
Ainslee Juarbe, biology junior, 
has used Top Hat Monocle for two 
of her classes, Integrated Principles 
of Biology II and Fundamentals of Human Nutrition, and appreciates the convenience of Top Hat Mono-cle over a clicker.
“You can pretty much count 
on everyone to have at least their cellphones in class, so there’s no chance of accidentally forgetting 
your clicker at home and missing a 
point for class,” Juarbe said.
Juarbe has also noticed a change 
in attendance due to the use of Top Hat Monocle in her classes.
“I’m a nerd, so I always go to 
class no matter what,” Juarbe said. “But I know other students only go to class for the Top Hat questions.”Company releases clicker alternativeBaxter

RECOVERY.

Mikal van Oene prepped her kitchen for 
surgery.
Using as much antiseptic as possible, she 
transformed her dining room table into an 
operating table for her beloved friend.
To make the experience as painless as 
possible, van Oene measured the correct 
dosage of Children’s Tylenol and blindfold-
ed her before beginning the daunting task.
Van Oene, a 22-year-old UF English se-
nior, worked to save her feathered friend, 
Doctor Peeps, Ph.D. — a task that came nat-
urally to the steady hand of the musically 
inclined taxidermist and tattoo artist.
After researching backyard chickens sev-
eral months before, an ad on Craigslist sealed 
the deal: van Oene was the proud owner of 
four chickens — including The Doctor.
The tragic day had been like any other. 
Van Oene was hanging out with a friend 
while her four chickens roamed around in 
the backyard.
Then, van Oene said she heard a swoop-
ing sound followed by “terrified scream-
ing.”
Van Oene and her friend looked outside 
just in time to see a hawk flying away with 
one of the chickens, a white silky bantam 
named Doctor Peeps in its clutches.
In a matter of seconds, the hawk dropped The Doctor back down to the earth.
It wasn’t until van Oene was at the bird’s 
side that she saw the full extent of the dam-
age: Doctor Peep’s wing was dangling by a 
ligament and the bone was sticking out.
Unable to get in touch with a veterinarian 
and having no car to search for an open clin-ic, van Oene went to www.backyardchick-
ens.com, a forum filled with information 
and advice for chicken owners, to see what options were available to save her chicken — if any.
Van Oene found an article on the website 
that detailed how to do an emergency am-putation, which seemed to be the only viable 
option.
“At the time, we were kind of freaking 
out, but we were pretty confident in our 
ability,” she said.
With shears, painkillers, a syringe and other necessary tools at her disposal, van 
Oene and her friend performed surgery on The Doctor.
She sewed the outside of the skin loosely 
to ensure the amputated bone was inside the 
wound and wouldn’t swell if Doctor Peeps 
survived.
“A lot of it was ingenuity, and a lot of it 
was following the steps,” van Oene said.
Doctor Peeps now struts around with 
multicolored toenails and a diaper bedaz-zled with a rhinestone American flag.
The road to recovery was tough, van 
Oene said. 
She had to constantly clean Doctor 
Peeps’wound and rewrap it, and she had to clean the cage twice a day. The Doctor was incapacitated for two days and wouldn’t 
eat.
But, van Oene soon noticed that The Doc-
tor was beginning to heal and adjust to her 
new life with only one wing.
“She would slowly come up to us and 
cuddle with our leg, or she’d want to be held,” she said. “Every time we moved out of 
the room … she would kind of slowly walk 
out of her cage and into the other room.”
Now, Doctor Peeps’ life is normal enough 
that she can lay eggs, which van Oene said are “delicious.”
She said Doctor Peeps has been laying 
five eggs a week since October.
Eggs or no eggs, van Oene still has fun 
with Doctor Peeps.
“We go to the park, we go to dances — I’ll 
dress her up in a tuxedo —  and we go on 
movie dates,” van Oene said jokingly.MONDAY, NOVEMBER 19, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 5

So, like, where does the Republican Party go from here?
It just seems like some pretty strong liberal wins during 
the election on Nov . 6. If Republicans want to stay relevant, 
they’ll have to see what American people actually want and try 
to provide it.
“The Obama campaign was following the old playbook of 
giving a lot of stuff to groups that they hoped they could get to vote for them and be motivated to go out to the polls, speciﬁ  cally the African American community, the Hispanic community and young people,” said Mitt Romney in a telephone town hall last week, according to the Los Angeles Times.
“In each case they were very generous in what they gave to 
those groups,” he said.
Uh, did you receive any gifts from President Obama? We 
don’t recall seeing a ton of free Obama swag ﬂ  oating around. Or were the “gifts” Romney referred to basic human rights and fair opportunities? Just saying.
It’s not like Obama tried to bribe people into voting for him. 
He just represented a party that aims to provide fair choices for its supporters. It means that Romney lost, and now he sounds super bitter about the whole thing.
Sure, his concession speech was pretty humble, if not a little 
late in the evening. But he canceled the credit cards given to his 
staffers soon after, which stranded them around the country, ac-
cording to www.jezebel.com. 
“We had 20 Republican debates, that was absolutely nuts,” 
Romney also said during the call, according to the Hufﬁ  ngton Post. “It opened us up to gaffes and to material that could be used against us in the general, and we were ﬁ  ghting these de-bates for a year, and the incumbent president just sat back and laughed.”
It is not our fault when you say stupid things. That goes for 
everyone. If you say dumb things all the time, just be prepared to be mocked for them. It’s foolish to think people would agree with some candidates for certain things. Remember when Newt Gingrich wanted to make a colony on the moon? Yeah.
“We’re in a big hole,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham in an inter-
view on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” according to the Hufﬁ  ngton Post. “We’re not getting out of it by comments like that. When you’re in a hole, stop digging. He keeps digging.”
“The bottom line is we were perceived to be intolerant on 
some issues. And tone-deaf on others,” said Republican strate-gist Ron Kaufman, who advised the Romney campaign, accord-ing to the Christian Science Monitor.
Why is everyone so surprised that the way the Republican 
party is set up today is very much misaligned with American culture? This is not the 1950s anymore, gentleman, so it’s time to get hip. Get with the program, fellas.
It’s just so funny that Republicans were very sure up until 
Election Day that they were going to win everything, and after 
the fact, they can speak very easily about why they didn’t win 
everything.
At least everyone, besides Romney , isn’t too bitter about the 
whole thing.A moment of clarity for Eleanor Rigby
You may not remember this, dear apostrophic reader, 
but last year, our football team was not so good.
In fact, there was a portion of last year’s Furman 
University game where it looked like we were not going to win against Furman(!!), and like so many of you, I turned the game off during the second quarter and went to take my dog on a long walk.
Her name was Elly (short for Eleanor Rigby). She was 
the most adorable little basset hound you can imagine. 
She was also a ball of destructive energy. I have a hard 
time believing she was anything other than an avatar of Shiva whose eventual goal was to destroy the entire human race.
On that afternoon (Nov. 7, 2011? Somewhere thereabouts. 
I remember the weather was that beautiful combination of crystal clarity, sunlight and 60-degree temperature that you can only ﬁ  nd during the winter in Gainesville), I took her out to a retention pond by my house and absorbed myself in thoughts of anything other than Gators football.
Elly was not that old at this point. She was still a puppy, 
maybe 4 months old, and so her ﬁ  tness levels had been slowly building. Until that day, she didn’t want to do any-thing but run and run and run…
There was a sheen of cold resting like a mist ﬁ  ve feet 
above the ground, and the grass seemed to me vigorous and dancing under the cold light.
The weeds were nothing but ﬂ  owery tendrils of the 
earth, and a light rain either the day before or the day be-fore that had made the dirt below delightfully moist; just enough that in bare feet my toes almost giggled with plea-sure to slowly drag across the earth as Elly ran in asymp-totic circles around me.
She’d run a little ways away, notice that I wasn’t follow-
ing fast enough, then hurtle back toward me, a satellite of pure love and energy to my plodding planet.
She was wearing a leash, but I let it drop because I knew 
she would never run too far from me: I’ve mentioned that she was evilly destructive, but she was also scared to be far from me, and so, as she ran, I lost myself in thoughts.
That day, Elly warmed my 
spirit. When she ran away, I knew she would return because she didn’t know there was even an-other option.
Me and my roommates liked to imagine Elly talking and 
complaining to us in a high-pitched voice.
We’d make each other laugh for hours playing with her 
and saying things like, “Um, sir, you may not have noticed, sir, but, um, my food dish is empty, and I’d really like it if you’d ﬁ  ll it, sir.” Or “Um, sir, I know you’re having fun, but if you don’t give me Mr. Duck back RIGHT NOW, I’m gonna chew off your ears while you’re asleep.”
(Mr. Duck was her stuffed toy duck. She loved that 
thing, but it had no squeaker or wings left by the time we had to throw it away.)
She loved toys that made noise most of all, especially 
if said noise was annoying and loud. Sweetbay had these squeaky toys on sale for 50 cents, and we bought like ﬁ  ve of them, but she destroyed them all in less than three hours.
She’d look up at us with the saddest eyes and say, “Um, 
sir, I hate to bother you, sir, but my toy seems to have stopped squeaking,” and we’d laugh, then throw another one at her to watch the gleam in her eyes as she tore the thing to bits. She was beautiful, man, just beautiful.
Elly’s dead now.She wasn’t a year old before a snake bit her one day 
while she was playing or exploring.
I’m just thankful for the time I got with her.Save a space in heaven for me for the next time we meet 
forever, you beautiful, awful dog.

The anatomical Homo sapiens has been walking 
Earth for nearly a quarter of a million years.
On a 24-hour clock, we came about roughly at 
23:58:43 in comparison to the age of Earth.
Not until 500 B.C. did Pythagoras claim Earth was not 
flat and nearly 1,000 years later — about 400 years ago — the telescope was invented. I was alive when America’s first optical telescope, Hubble, was sent into space. To say we know much about what lies within the confines of our 
universe is to be dense.
I have always found it intriguing that humans have 
maintained a highly egocentric view of ourselves.
Always convinced the greatest city lay at the “center of 
Earth.” Always convinced the sun and planets revolved 
around us. Always convinced we were at the center of all 
stars in the galaxy. Always convinced we had someone 
watching over our particular planet, our particular spe-
cies and that we were the only living organisms, let alone 
“intellectuals,” in the universe.
How humbling it is to lie on a grassy hilltop staring 
into a deep, dark sky, knowing we are one of a handful 
of minor planets revolving around an average star, one of 
the over quarter trillion (with a “T”) estimated stars in the Milky Way with likely more than that in planets.
While knowing there are roughly the same number 
of galaxies in the universe as there are stars in the Milky 
Way , how can one remotely claim to believe that Earth 
is the only harbinger of life? I haven’t even begun to talk about the age of the universe.
It is because of the Hubble Space Telescope that we 
know the universe to be 13.72 billion years old, humans 
existing with telescopes for 3.28 millionths of a percent of that ex-
istence.
Countless stars and planets 
have been born and died off be-
fore Earth was even formed, all 
with the potential to hold the conditions for life to arise.
The odds are ever stacked in favor for life to exist else-
where in the universe. With a symbolically infinite num-
ber of places for life to arise and do so in less than a billion 
years (in Earth’s example), there can only be one answer 
as far as I am concerned.
We are not alone.Chemically , there really isn’t anything special about us. 
We are made of water and carbon, mostly.
Hydrogen, oxygen and carbon are among the most 
abundant elements in the universe — carbon having 
more combinations than any other elements combined. 
Ranking order of abundance of elements in the universe 
to that of humans, you find they match up perfectly , all 
elements having been forged in the creation and destruc-
tion of stars.
“We are star stuff,” as the late and great Carl Sagan put 
it.
If you are not familiar with the Hubble photo called 
“Ultra Deep Field,” I highly recommend you look it up. This was a photo taken by Hubble after we pointed it in 
a very dark area of the sky for a long time. The result was 
nearly 10,000 individual galaxies and only a handful of 
lone stars in the foreground. If you were to hold the hole 
of a threading needle up into the night sky , everything 
that falls within “Ultra Deep Field” fits inside that eye of 
the needle.
Here’s the catch. We know it takes time for light to 
travel a distance, and we know how far away those galax-
ies are (13 billion light years), which means we are essen-
tially looking back in time to galaxies and stars that don’t exist anymore.
At any point in time, one of the solar systems within 
one of those galaxies could have held the right condi-
tions for life to rise. These systems, having long been de-
stroyed, could have been replaced with new systems with completely new conditions to bear chance for life to grab 
hold.
Extraterrestrial life in the universe is inevitable with 
these sorts of odds.

UWireThanksgiving is associated with spending time 
with family, appreciating blessings in our lives and, most of all, eating. 
 We gorge ourselves on turkey, stuffing, ham, sweet potatoes, cranberry sauce, green bean casserole and a plethora of other dishes specifically designed to 
make everyone eat until they’re miserable and ready to sleep for the rest of the afternoon.
Last Thanksgiving, however, I passed up most of 
these goodies because of a lifestyle choice I made in 
May 2011. 
I decided to become a vegetarian, partially for the 
health benefits of giving up meat and focusing on fruits 
and vegetables, and partially because I love animals.
However, most of what compelled me stemmed from 
a need to simply prove that I could do it. 
I hardly ate red meat, and I felt that I could give up 
chicken and tuna without much of a fuss.
I chose not to forgo dairy and eggs, since animals 
aren’t harmed in the making of them (disregarding the idea that an egg is alive; I’m not here to argue about rights) and to simply live as a lacto-ovo vegetarian.
This proved more difficult than I planned. At the time, I lived in Hays, Kan., which made it dif-
ficult to find vegetarian protein supplements. 
Because I cut meat out of my diet, I tried to eat more 
peanut butter, eggs and protein shakes, but my diet still needed more sustenance. 
One store carried vegetarian imitation chicken 
breasts, so that made up the bulk of my protein. I dubbed this magical substance “fake chicken.”
My family didn’t agree with my lifestyle change. 
They constantly asked me when I was going to “get past 
this phase” and “start eating with the family again.” 
I grew up in a meat-and-potatoes household, so my 
mother had no idea how to feed me when I came home 
and simply substituted all the meat in our meals with 
cheese.
Needless to say, I either ate a lot of salad or consumed 
the entirety of my calorie content via Velveeta.
Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner proved to be the 
biggest challenges. 
My grandma forgot I didn’t eat meat and made beef 
stew for lunch. I ended up scouring the fridge 
and throwing together a salad.
At Thanksgiving dinner, I 
loaded my plate with the veg-
etables and fruits at the table, finishing my meal with a piece of 
chocolate pie. 
Just as I was taking my last bite, my brother asked 
how I could eat something with pudding.
This was when I learned about the sneaky foods that 
don’t follow vegetarian diet guidelines. 
Foods like pudding, gelatin, marshmallows and Ra-
men Noodle seasoning are made of animal byproducts such as hooves and bone marrow. 
Even certain kinds of processed cheese are cultured 
with animal by-products.
He explained this to me as I guiltily pushed my emp-
ty plate away, vowing never again to ingest pudding.
I aimed to continue this lifestyle for a full year, but 
because of a rigorous exercise schedule, I began to lose too much weight, and my hair started to thin. 
I ended my vegetarianism last March to allay my 
family’s concerns over my health, but I learned a lot in the process.
For those of you considering giving up meat for an 
extended period of time, I offer a few suggestions. Tak-ing a vitamin supplement can give you anything your body may be lacking during this period. 
You can also eat other foods rich in protein such as 
quinoa, beans, nuts or tofu.
Watch for unexpected hair loss or weight loss, and, 
most of all, take care of yourself. 
By cutting meat out of my diet, I became more ener -
gized and less lethargic.
 But if done the wrong way, a vegetarian diet can 
have the opposite effects.
For those of you making the brave attempt during 
the heartiest of holidays, www.allrecipes.com features a vegetarian Thanksgiving page that shows various ways for vegetarians to enjoy sweet potatoes, salads, cranber -
ry sauces and other delightful dishes. 
Turkey and gravy will just make your family sleepy.

On Friday, Santa Fe College biology pro-
fessor Jerry Johnston and three other research-
ers sat on a dock, their legs dipped in Hornsby Spring.
The group’s plunge into the 72-degree wa-
ter was a part of a continuing research series on turtles in the Suwannee and Santa Fe riv-ers.
Hornsby Spring is inside Camp Kulaqua, 
a church camp owned by the Seventh-day Adventists. Their religion protects all living things, Johnston said, so the spring is relative-ly untouched.
“They have an excellent environmental 
ethic,” he said. “Part of their mission is to pro-tect all of the life that’s on their property , and that includes the turtles.”
Usually accompanied by a few volunteers, 
he pulls turtles out of the rivers and springs to collect data before releasing them.
Friday’s mission was to assess how the Au-
gust flooding from Hurricane Isaac affected the turtle populations.
Austin Cave, a former student of Johnston 
and a frequent volunteer, said he likes the un-touched nature of Hornsby Spring.
“We like Kulaqua because it’s a place 
where the females can come up and lay eggs,” Cave said. “There’s a general rule across the park: Don’t mess with the animals. And they 
enforce that. It takes away the element of hu-
man danger.”
The springs appear to be turtle nurseries, 
Johnston said. They provide a lot of vegetation for hiding, there’s an abundance of food, and the temperatures may be optimal for growth.
The turtle gathering is a catch-and-release-
style hunt, he said, open to anyone who would like to join.
Once in the tea-colored water, Johnston and 
the other three snorkelers combed the spring’s basin. When they see movement, they attack. From far away, it sounded like a dolphin chas-ing prey . The water churned white, and after a few moments, the scientists had another tiny turtle to study.
After about two hours of turtle catching, 
the group set up a processing shop to take 
measurements and mark the turtles for fu-
ture identification. The group collected 77 Su-wannee cooters, nine loggerhead musk, eight stinkpots, five peninsula cooters and three yellow-bellied sliders on their run.
Johnston doesn’t provide class credit or 
compensation for the trips, but he said pub-lishing papers is a good way for students to get a competitive advantage for grad school 
and the job market. He said it’s also a good 
way to test out what it’s like to be a scientist.“I think the adventure is one of the appeal-
ing things,” he said. “Even if you’re not a sci-ence major, people enjoy catching turtles by hand.”

It may not be baseball season, but UF 
students are still swinging bats.
The Gator Cricket Club placed first in 
the South East Conference Champion-
ship earlier this month, winning the title 
for the second consecutive year.
The team competed against seven 
others, including the No. 2 University of 
South Florida, according to the Ameri-can College Cricket website.
“There was a bit of pressure on us 
to defend ourselves,” said team captain Sudharsan Govindarajan, a 22-year-old second-year mechanical engineering 
graduate student at UF.
The team practices Mondays and 
Thursdays for two hours at Lake Alice 
Field. However, a cricket field requires a pitch, which is a rectangle of special ma-terial 22 yards by 10 feet at the center of the field. The UF team lacks a pitch and plays on the grass.
“Most teams have a pitch of their 
own,” Govindarajan said. “It’s an ad-vantage that helps a lot.”
Vice captain Harshul Kumar said the 
ball bounces differently on a pitch than on the grass. He said the team is trying to raise money to buy a pitch, but it could cost more than $600.
UF is currently ranked No. 12, but the 
23-year-old second-year construction engineering graduate student said that will change.  
Ricky Nayar, a 22-year-old fifth-year 
civil and environmental engineering student, said the team won by about 70 runs.
But the league isn’t only about win-
ning, Nayar said. Team members also teach others in the school and communi-ty about cricket. Teams get bonus points for outreach prior to tournaments, which can affect their rankings.
The national championship, which 
will be in March, will feature about 30 teams. Nayar said the UF club has gone to Nationals since 2010.
Between now and March, the team 
will play practice games against Florida teams to prepare, Govindarajan said.
“[Winning] gives us a lot of confi-
dence going into nationals,” he said.

Local tutoring service Study 
Edge is offering a new way for cus-
tomers to access study materials. Study Edge has finalized its iPhone, iPad and Android apps, which have been in development since August.Anne Grundhoefer, director of 
marketing and technology and de-velopment, said Study Edge waited to release the app until it had no ap-parent glitches.
“It has been a process getting ev-
erything finalized, but we wanted to make sure everything was per -
fect for finals,” Grundhoefer said.Students can currently access 
Study Edge materials on Facebook, as well as download study packets, and purchase memberships and to-kens for viewing videos.
“Everyone knows how to use 
Facebook and can access every-thing 24/7, which is the beauty of it,” Grundhoefer said. “Now you can do everything from your iP-hone that you can do on your Fa-cebook.”
Laura Gutsche, a 20-year-old 
public relations junior, said the app would make using Study Edge more convenient.
“So many times I forget what 
times reviews are or I want to watch a video again, so it will be helpful to be able to do all that on my phone,” Gutsche said.Food science and human nutri-
tion junior Mallory Neumann, 20, said she loves the idea of mobile 
access to study materials but thinks 
Study Edge needs to move in an-other direction as well.
“I don’t like the fact there is not 
an alternative option in case Face-book goes down,” Neumann said. “What happens when Facebook is under maintenance and you need to study?”

Allison Doolittle has followed the Twilight 
series since she read the first book in grade 
school for a class assignment.
“After that, I was hooked,” the 21-year-old 
UF sociology senior said. “I’ve read all of them 
twice.”
Hundreds of vehicles surrounded Butler 
Plaza’s Regal Gainesville Stadium 14 on Thurs-day night as fans like Doolittle packed eight au-
ditoriums to watch the much-anticipated final film of the Twilight series,“The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn — Part 2.”
Last year, lines wrapped around the build-
ing as people waited outside in cold tempera-tures for hours to see the fourth movie in the series. But this time, lines were scarce.
Regal Cinemas declined to comment on the 
official number of people in attendance and the amount of money made from the premiere.
Ronni Hunt, a 34-year-old UF patron access 
coordinator, said she is an avid reader and has followed the Twilight series since the first book was published. 
“This series allowed me to go to another 
world,” she said. “It’s addicting.”
UF English professor R. Brandon Kershner 
said series like “The Twilight Saga” let audi-ences enter a world where magic exists.
“They’re powerful mixtures of fantasies 
and realism,” he said. “People identify with the characters and live vicariously through them.”
Kershner said going to the movies is not just 
about seeing the film; it’s a bonding experience for friends and families.
The Butler Plaza theater’s first show began 
at about 10 p.m., and the last began at 12:45 a.m. Friday.
Doolittle and Hunt went to the premiere 
together, along with Doolittle’s mother, grand-mother and best friend.
They wore matching T-shirts reading: “Bite 
me” on the front and “I was born to be a vam-pire” on the back.
“It was a two-day project,” Doolittle said.Even though their showing wasn’t until 
midnight, Hunt said her group arrived at the 
theater at about 10:15 p.m.
“We knew that we wouldn’t have to wait in 
an insane line,” she said. “I think the theater did 
a great job of keeping people out of the cold.”Twilight fans pack theaters for

With tears in their eyes, the Rev. 
Lawrence Reimer and the Rev. San-
dra Reimer smiled and hugged as they thanked the congregation that packed University Auditorium Sunday morning.
“We can think of nothing more 
important that God has with more truth and light,” Lawrence Reimer told the crowd.
The Reimers, both 68, are retir -
ing after 38 years of service to the United Church of Gainesville. The congregation celebrated the Reim-ers’ ministry with a two-hour ser -
vice of celebration and recognition.
The ceremony included live 
music, testimonies from longtime members and special presenta-tions.
“We celebrate how Lawrence 
and Sandy blessed us with their friendship and love for 38 years,” longtime member Sanford Berg said.
The Reimers, who are married, 
began their ministry at the United Church of Gainesville in January 1974. During their time with the church, they dealt with growing budgets and the relocation and renovation of their building, which used to be where Burrito Bros. Taco Co. is today.
The musical congregation per -
formed songs such as Lawrence Reimer’s “Bump a Rump” and “A-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-le-lu-ia.”
The Reimers were honored for 
their social justice work in the com-munity, especially when Florida re-instated the death penalty. Women of the congregation praised Sandra Reimer for her famous sermon “Eve Re-Framed.”
“We all grieve together for the 
end of this chapter in our lives,” member Jenny Hill said.
The Reimers’ sons, Chris and 
Matt Reimer, added comedy to the ceremony with ‘The Top 14 things of being a preacher’s kids.”
Near the end of the ceremony, 
the Florida Conference Minister of the United Church of Christ de-clared Nov. 18 to be Larry and San-dy Reimer Day. After, the Reimers were presented with a $5,000 AAA card and a travel account with $11,000.
John Schert, 60, has been a 
member of the United Church of Gainesville for 18 years. The Re-imers performed his marriage cer -
emony, baptized his daughter and 
gave the memorial service for his 
late wife.
“They have a deep personal 
connection with a wide diversity of people,” Schert said.
The United Church of 
Gainesville, which began in 1965 
with 62 members, accepts members 
of different faiths, beliefs, genders, sexual orientations and marital sta-
tuses.“This is the kind of church peo-
ple join who would never join a 
church,” Schert said.
A search committee is being as-
sembled to find one full-time pas-tor to replace the Reimers, who 
were both working part time.
After the ceremony, about 585 
parishioners attended a barbe-
cue picnic at Prairie Creek Lodge. Those not attending lined up after 
the service to say their goodbyes to 
the Reimers.
“I have such gratitude, and this 
is such a blessing,” Sandra Reimer said. “My heart is flowing with 
love.”MONDAY, NOVEMBER 19, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 9

Gainesville residents gathered at Thorne-
brook Village and Millhopper Square on Fri-
day for an evening of cheese spreads, chocolate wine and creativity at the Uptown Art Hop.
Nine stores ranging from art galleries to 
chocolate shops kept their doors open until 9 p.m. for Gainesville residents to socialize, check out local artists and wander the area.  
“That’s one of the reasons for the Art Hop: 
to make people more comfortable with art and make it nonthreatening,” said David Arrighi, owner of Thornebrook Gallery. “They can come in, have a glass of wine and talk about what they see. Maybe it will spark some-thing.”
French vocals and classic jazz standards 
wafted from the McIntyre Stained Glass Stu-dio & Art Gallery in Thornebrook Village. Inside, about 30 award ribbons hung over stained glass images of fish.
“The Art Hop is a really fun way to get out 
and be exposed,” said Mary McIntyre, who 
has run the gallery for 13 years. “Gainesville is 
learning to appreciate the wealth of talent we have.”
Art Hop is hosted and sponsored about six 
times a year by the businesses, Arrighi said.
“We just had the idea this might be fun to 
do, so we got together and did it,” he said.At Thornebrook Chocolate, attendees sam-
pled chocolate-infused wines from miniature edible cups.
Paula Wilkerson, a local chemical engineer 
and attendee, said she enjoyed the event be-cause she didn’t have to travel to a museum to find a collection of local art.
“There’s a lot of energy, creativity and mu-
tual support,” she said. “All these businesses are independently owned. People don’t know the creativity that brings to an area.”
For Malgorzata Deyrup, co-owner of  cloth-
ing shop Malgorzata’s, the Art Hop was easier than selling her creations at a street show.
Deyrup opened the store with her husband 
last year after they both retired from teaching chemistry at UF. Now, she spends most of her workdays either running the shop or creating handmade and hand-dyed shawls, scarves 
and decorations that hang from the walls of 
her shop.
“Even if you are a scientist, you can still 
have an imagination,” she said. “Dyeing is a little bit of chemistry.”

After finishing second the 
last three years, UF building 
construction students won the first place award in a regional competition for the first time.
Students beat out 19 oth-
er schools in the Associated Schools of Construction Region II-Southeast Region competi-tion, which took place Nov . 7 through Nov. 9 in Atlanta.
The green building competi-
tion focuses on sustainable al-ternatives for construction.
The Leadership in Energy 
and Environmental Design team was given a prompt and had 10 hours to submit a plan for the green building compe-tition and another 12 hours to prepare a presentation.
James Sullivan, an assistant 
professor for building construc-
tion and the adviser for the team, said this competition ig-ives students real-world experi-
ence in their chosen field.
“The neat thing about con-
struction is nobody gives you instructions on how to build something,” Sullivan said. “The students had to creatively design a solution, and that’s ex-actly what they did.”
Kyle Jaeger, a 23-year-old 
construction management se-nior, said the award showcases UF’s talented students.
The team received a check 
for $1,500 and will travel to Reno, Nev ., in the spring to compete in the national compe-tition.
“Finishing first overall so-
lidifies our reputation as one of the top construction schools in the nation and will hopefully serve as a message that a career in construction can be very re-warding,” he said.Construction students’ 
win paves future path

Adobe InDesign files and Photo-
shop sketches can consume several 
gigabytes if UF architecture sopho-more Zachary Wignall isn’t careful.
But thanks to a college promo-
tion by file-hosting service Dropbox.com, Wignall and other UF students can earn up to 25 GB worth of free space to store and share their files.
Students and faculty can help UF 
win Dropbox’s Great Space Race by using their school email accounts to sign up for Dropbox.
As of Sunday night, UF was 
ranked 17th in the national level of the contest with 9,570 points. Massa-chusetts Institute of Technology was in the lead with 41,214 points.Wignall said about 60 people in 
his design class have registered for the race. They already use Drop-
box’s cloud storage and file synchro-
nization features to work on class projects.
“It’s easy to use, and you don’t 
have to carry a flash drive around,” the 22-year-old said.
UF multimedia reporting instruc-
tor Douglas Coats uses Dropbox’s shared folders to grade his class’ au-
dio and image files. Having all the 
files in one place reduces the time it takes for Coats to grade his class’ work.
According to Dropbox’s lead-
erboard, about 4,200 Gators have joined the race so far and won 8 GB for the next two years.
UF is 1,684 points away from 
advancing to the next level of the competition and earning 15 GB for its students and faculty. The contest ends Dec.10.UF competes to take up 
more space from Dropbox
“We just had the idea this might 
be fun to do, so we got together 
and did it.”

  Mike Gillislee ﬁ  nally got over the 
hump.
  The senior running back got back on 
track against Jacksonville State, rushing 
20 times for 122 yards and a touchdown in Florida’s 23-0 win on Saturday in The Swamp. The 100-yard game and the rush-
ing score were the ﬁ  rst of each for Gillislee 
since a 14-6 win against LSU on Oct. 6.
  Despite breaking out of his slump 
against the Gamecocks, the only thing that mattered to Gillislee was getting the vic-
tory.
  “I just want to ﬁ  nish the season and win 
out,” Gillislee said on Nov. 5. “Win out at 
home.”
  Thanks to Gillislee’s quick start, the 
Gators won out at home. The DeLand na-tive tallied 81 yards on his ﬁ  rst nine car-ries, including a 46-yard run during Flori-da’s second drive.
  His longest rush of the day put the 
Gators at Jacksonville State’s 19-yard line. Caleb Sturgis put UF up 10-0 four plays later — none of which went to Gillislee.
  “We just wanted to convert some oth-
er things down the ﬁ  eld,” Muschamp said. “We felt like Mike’s yards would be there.”
  Gillislee will be key for a struggling Florida offense. After consecutive contests 
against non-BCS opponents Louisiana and 
Jacksonville State, UF will end the regu-
lar season with a stiffer challenge. Florida 
faces No. 12 Florida State in Tallahassee on 
Saturday.
  However, there will be more on the line 
for Gillislee than just UF’s seventh-ever 
season with 11 or more victories.
  Gillislee’s 122-yard performance against 
the Gamecocks gives him 964 yards on the 
season. He is 36 yards away from becom-ing the ﬁ  rst Gator to eclipse the 1,000-yard mark on the ground since Ciatrick Fason 
in 2004.
  “Certainly, 1,000 yards would be a great 
accomplishment, not just for him, but for 
our entire offense,” coach Will Muschamp said. “We know how difﬁ  cult it is for one 
guy to do that in this league.”
Gillislee had slumped in recent weeks. 
Before the season, he predicted he would 
reach 1,500 yards and 24 touchdowns.

� YEGUETE HAD 11 
POINTS AND 13 REBOUNDS.
  KATIE AGOSTIN
 Alligator Staff Writer
  TAMPA — With the score tied at 
22 late in the ﬁ  rst half, Scottie Wil-
bekin drove the ball to the net, hop-
ing to put the Gators ahead in his 
ﬁ  rst game of the season. Although 
Wilbekin missed the shot, Will Yeg-uete was right behind him to grab 
the rebound and score the put back. 
  After early turnovers and foul 
trouble plagued UF, Yeguete led No. 10 Florida (3-0) to a 66-45 win 
against Middle Tennessee (2-1) in 
The Tampa Bay Times Forum. 
  “I was just trying to go after all 
the rebounds today, because [Mid-dle Tennessee] was scrambling a lot 
and they were pressuring us,” Yeg-
uete said. “We talked about it when 
we were getting ready for them, but 
I don’t think we thought they were going to be that 
physical.”
  Y e g u e t e 
racked up 11 points and 13 
rebounds for 
his ﬁ  rst double-
double this sea-son. The 6-foot-7 
junior   started 
strong, narrowly missing a double-double in the ﬁ  rst half. He entered 
the second half with 10 points and 
eight rebounds while avoiding turnovers and accounting for only one foul. He also made the ﬁ  rst 
three-pointer of his career. 
  Despite shooting 66.7 percent 
from the ﬁ  eld, Yeguete struggled from the line, making only 2 of 6 
free throws. As a team, Florida was 
17 of 29 from the charity stripe. 
  “The one area that I wish we had 
done a little bit better in the second half was shoot free throws,” coach 
Billy Donovan said. “But overall I 
thought the presence up front in the 
second half was the difference in the game.”
  After serving a three-game sus-
pension for undisclosed reasons, 
Wilbekin took the court for his ﬁ  rst 
game of the season. 
  Wilbekin started slowly against 
Middle Tennessee. In the ﬁ  rst half, 
the 6-foot-2 point guard had only two points on 25-percent shooting. 
  But Wilbekin shined after halftime, 
ﬁ  nishing with eight points, three as-
sists and two steals.  Junior forward notches double-double in blowout victory
THE END OF GREGULATION
  Florida fans should be terriﬁ  ed of the 
looming matchup against Florida State, but not because of anything 
that happened on Saturday. 
  In fact, Saturday should be encourag-
ing. No. 1 Kansas State and No. 2 Oregon both fell, vaulting Florida to No. 4 in the 
BCS and putting UF in a position to play 
for the crystal football with a win and a Notre Dame loss. 
  Sure, UF also notched a lackluster win 
against a lousy opponent for the third con-
secutive week on Saturday, but what did a 23-0 victory against Jacksonville State tell 
us that we didn’t already know? 
  The Gators amassed only 154 passing 
yards, but is that really all that shocking? While this was the weakest competition to date, we don’t even have evidence UF can successfully pass the ball down the ﬁ  eld in 
practice. And how much does Saturday’s 
game really mean going forward?
  Coach Will Muschamp told offensive 
coordinator Brent Pease to run the ball as often as possible in an effort to counteract 
Jacksonville State’s overload blitzes.   “We could’ve done some more things 
offensively, but I just told Brent, ‘Let’s go 
win the game,’” Muschamp said. 
  On Saturday that meant the same thing 
it has all season — run, run and run some more. 
  Why bother to break from the formula? 
Signiﬁ  cantly changing the offense this late in the season is impossible. Even if Jacoby Brissett had racked up 400 yards through the air, he’d be benched for Jeff Driskel regardless, provided all goes well in the 
training room this week.   So run it at Jack-
sonville State, take 
your 202 yards at 
5.6 yards per carry 
and get ready for next week. 
The Gators 
shouldn’t try to be something they 
aren’t. 
  “Don’t ask them to do things they can’t 
do,” Muschamp said. “We were going to FSU’s strengths more troubling than Florida’s faults

NOTEBOOK
ADAM PINCUS
Alligator Staff Writer
Despite facing non-BCS opponents the past 
two weeks, Florida is No. 4 in the latest BCS 
rankings.
With top-ranked Kansas State losing by 28 
points to Baylor and No. 2 Oregon falling to Stanford at home on Saturday , UF is one step 
closer to its third BCS National Championship 
Game appearance in seven seasons.
Florida jumped two spots from last week. 
The Gators are ranked fifth in the Harris Poll, sixth in the USA Today Coaches Poll, and sec-
ond in the computer rankings. The AP poll, 
which doesn’t factor in the BCS, has Florida at 
No. 6.
In order for Florida to reach the national ti-
tle game, the Gators would have to beat No. 10 Florida State on Saturday and hope new No. 1 
Notre Dame loses on the road to USC. 
Florida is expected to leapfrog the Fighting 
Irish if that scenario were to occur.
The Southeastern Conference Champion-
ship Game, likely between No. 2 Alabama and No. 3 Georgia, will determine one participant 
in the title game. The loser will fall out of con-
tention. 
Oregon, now at No. 5, could play in the 
Pac-12 championship game if UCLA defeats 
Stanford — the ninth-ranked team in the BCS 
standings — at home. Another game for Or -
egon would increase its chances of jumping 
idle Florida.
Brissett gets the start: Jacoby Brissett stood at 
the podium after Saturday’s game in a posi-
tion he hasn’t ever been in — as the starter on a winning team.
The sophomore, playing in place of injured 
starter Jeff Driskel, completed 14 of 22 passes 
for 154 yards in Florida’s 23-point shutout win 
against Jacksonville State on Senior Day.
“It was great,” Brissett said of the start. “It 
went well.”
Driskel missed 
the game due to a 
sprained right ankle, 
which the sophomore 
suffered in the third quarter against Louisiana last week. Driskel’s status for Florida State will become clearer as the week progresses, coach 
Will Muschamp said.
Injury update: There were more questions 
than answers when Florida completed its 
shutout of Jacksonville State in The Swamp.Fullback Hunter Joyer left the game in the 
second quarter due to a left thigh injury.
Right tackle Chaz Green left the game in 
the first half after suffering an ankle injury . Both players should be fine, Muschamp said.
Guard Ian Silberman suffered a torn labrum 
against Louisiana. He will miss the remainder 
of the season and, most likely, spring practice.
Missing from Saturday’s game were wide 
receiver Andre Debose and safety De’Ante 
Saunders. Debose suffered a knee injury in 
practice on Nov . 1. 
“[De’Ante] had another injury,” Mus-
champ said. “He’ll be out next week and the bowl game.”
Saunders missed the first two games of 
2012 for undisclosed reasons.

org.Florida vaults to No. 4 in BCS standings after top two falter
be a team that was going to have 
to grind it out a little bit offen-sively.”
But grinding out a win will be 
more difficult than ever on Satur -
day. The Seminoles lead the na-tion with 7.27 yards gained per 
offensive play and 3.67 yards al-
lowed per defensive play. 
Think about how nuts that is 
for a second. Per play, they are the nation’s No. 1 team on both sides 
of the ball. 
Turning this into one number, 
Florida State’s composite 2 (No. 1 
on offense plus No. 1 on defense) 
is on pace to be by far the best 
among big-six teams in the past six seasons — the farthest back I could find usable statistics. 
Alabama has a 9 (No. 7 on of-
fense, No. 2 on defense) this year, 
and the next closest is 2009 Flor -
ida, which put up a 10 (No. 3 on 
offense, No. 7 on defense).
But UF’s answer to solving 
FSU’s dominance is not, “Air it out, or else.” 
Florida needs to get locked in 
a defensive struggle by exposing 
a young and inconsistent FSU of-
fensive line. 
Make this game the ugliest of all the ugly games. 
Win the battle of field posi-
tion. 
Make sure the gap between 
your No. 3-ranked 41.6 net yards 
per punt and FSU’s 101st-ranked 
34.5 net yards per punt is critical. 
Be thankful there’s only one 
Xavier Rhodes, and FSU’s other options in the secondary have 
looked beatable. 
Pray that some act of God gives 
whoever is healthy enough to play 
tackle the power to block Bjoern 
Werner and Tank Carradine. 
Wait for E.J. Manuel to make a 
decision he shouldn’t, then capi-
talize. 
Take care of the ball. 
Pound that vaunted rushing 
defense over and over again until 
somebody slips and Mike Gillislee finds a crease. 
Most importantly, just keep it 
close. In a tight game, a broken tackle or a lucky bounce can be the difference between winning and losing.
If Florida gets that bounce 
and a beatable Notre Dame team stumbles on the road against a talented USC squad, the Gators 
could be playing for the national 
title.
Contact Greg Luca at gluca@
alligator.org.GREG , from page 13But those goals have slipped 
out of reach since mid-October.
In the five games prior to Sat-
urday, Gillislee had averaged only 
58.8 yards per game and 3.3 yards per carry. He did not score a rush-ing touchdown during that span.
Despite Gillislee’s recent strug-
gles, Florida nose tackle Omar Hunter has not seen his fellow senior slow down. In fact, Hunter believes Gillislee is currently at 
his best.
“I remember having to tackle 
him in camp,” Hunter said. “That boy is running the ball hard. I been 
here since Gilly first got here, and 
he’s been getting better and better 
each and every week.”
Gillislee’s breakout season 
comes on the 
heels of three 
years with limit-
ed playing time. During his first three seasons, 
Gillislee racked 
up 920 yards and 10 touchdowns 
on 145 carries. In 2012, Gillislee has 964 yards and eight rushing 
touchdowns on 211 carries.
With a trip to the BCS National Championship still not out of the 
question, the Gators will turn to 
Gillislee to spur the attack against 
Florida State’s rushing defense, which ranks first nationally with just 70.6 yards allowed per game.
However, whether Gillislee is 
held in check or  puts together an-other game like his performance against Jacksonville State, he has just one goal in mind.
“He’s worried about winning 
the game,” Muschamp said. “I know how Mike is. He’s a team guy. He wants to win more than anything else.”

“It was definitely a little bit of an adjustment having a week 
and a half off,” Wilbekin said. “The first half I was trying to 
find my place a little bit, and in the second half I got into the 
flow.”
Although Yeguete was key to UF’s early success, Kenny 
Boynton, who scored a game-high 20 points, provided a late spark. After missing all four field goal attempts in the first half,  Boynton notched the Gators’ final 13 points, including a perfect 
7-of-7 clip from the line. 
“The shots that I shot in the first half, I thought those were 
going to drop,” Boynton said. “But they didn’t, so I stayed 
poised. They were a great defensive team, (but) in the end I just got open looks, and I capitalized on them.”

Florida entered Sunday’s Sweet 16 match against 
Notre Dame with five come-from-behind wins. 
When the Fighting Irish jumped ahead 1-0 in the 
20th minute, the stage was set for another Gators 
comeback.  
Unfortunately for UF, its luck ran out with the 
season on the line.
Florida (19-5-1, 11-2 Southeastern Conference) 
could not capitalize on its many chances against Notre Dame (16-5-2, 8-1-1 Big East) and lost 2-0. 
UF failed to score despite being awarded 15 cor -
ner kicks on Sunday.
“We got a little bit away from what we do best, 
which is keep the ball on the ground and possess,” coach Becky Burleigh said. “You have to credit Notre Dame for disrupting some of that, but also I 
think we were just a little bit off.”
Unlike the Gators, the Fighting Irish capitalized 
on their lone corner kick.
In the 20th minute, Fighting Irish midfielder 
Rebecca Twining scored her third goal of the sea-son off a corner kick from defender Brittany von 
Rueden.
“I’m not really a great heading strength on the 
field,” Twining said. “I just went straight to the ball 
and headed it in.”Despite falling behind early, the Gators stuck 
with the Fighting Irish for the next 51 minutes. But 
when Notre Dame scored again in the 71st minute, Florida’s fate was sealed.
“The second goal was really the back breaker, 
because you feel like when you’re chasing one, 
you’re always in it,” Burleigh said.
Burleigh said she was proud of the way the team 
stayed in the game after Notre Dame’s goal despite 
the outcome.
“I didn’t think our team quit or slowed down,” 
she said. 
Senior midfielder Holly King said the pressure 
got to the players, affecting the team’s passing and 
execution.
“I think just having the pressure on us, they’re 
up two-nothing, and we’re trying to push it,” King 
said. “We could have been more composed.”
Added Burleigh: “That’s a big task. It’s a hard 
thing to do. But I know we’re capable of doing that. …This team proved that you can play like we play and get results.”

Sophomore Kayla Lewis can do 
special things when she is on the 
floor. 
But injuries have significantly 
reduced her playing time through-
out her career. 
Multiple leg injuries limited 
Lewis to 16 games as a freshman, 
and a stress fracture in her hip suf-
fered on Nov. 17 against Florida State forced her to redshirt last 
season.
Now fully healthy, Lewis is 
back producing for UF. 
Through three games, Lewis is 
averaging 11 points and a team-leading 8.7 rebounds per game. 
She notched her first career dou-ble-double with 11 points and 12 
rebounds against Georgia State on 
Nov. 11.
To -
night, she will play 
in her 
f o u r t h g a m e 
— more than she played all last 
season — as Florida (2-1) faces 
North Florida (0-3) at 7 p.m. in the 
O’Connell Center. 
“Kayla is just a tough matchup 
because she has a unique skill set 
with incredible athleticism,” coach 
Amanda Butler said. 
Lewis was one of the few bright 
spots in Florida’s lopsided 98-67 loss to Florida State on Thursday 
in Tallahassee. She scored 10 points 
and pulled down seven rebounds 
in 24 minutes. She was also disrup-tive on the defensive end.  
Butler said Lewis’ presence is 
just as important as her numbers. Lewis has the leadership qualities Butler is looking for on an inexpe-
rienced team. 
“The rebounding part of what [Lewis] brings … is the thing that 
we really are going to have to count 
on her for,” Butler said. “She’s got 
to bring those sort of numbers for 
us and really bring a sort of pres-
ence every single time she is on the floor.”
Lewis has proven difficult to 
defend after developing a more 
diverse offensive game during the 
summer. In UF’s season-opening win against Fairfield, Lewis uti-lized down screens to make 2 of 3 attempts from behind the arc. 
Against Florida State, she used her 
athleticism to get to the basket. 
On a team searching for consis -
tent scorers to complement senior Jennifer George, a healthy Lewis is 
an ideal fit. 
“[Lewis] can rebound, she can 
block shots, and she can shoot,” 
junior Jaterra Bonds said. “That gives her an edge on the court.” Oft-injured sophomore starting fast

Seniors Betsy Smith, Tanger -
ine Wiggs and Sundai Weston 
stepped onto the O’Connell Center floor for possibly the last time in their careers on 
Sunday.
They walked off Southeast-
ern Conference champions.
The Gators had already 
clinched a share of the confer -
ence title after Friday’s win 
against LSU, but No. 16 Florida (23-4, 17-1 SEC) sealed the deal with a three-set sweep (25-19, 
25-14, 25-19) against South 
Carolina (17-14, 5-14 SEC) on Senior Day.   
Coach Mary Wise said the 
defense carried the team Fri-day night, but the offense stole the show on Sunday with a .464 hitting percentage — just four points shy of UF’s season-
high.
“The theme on Friday night 
was defense,” Wise said. “To-
day was the offense. We were just a little bit quicker to the ball, making good decisions. Now our goal is to put our best defense with our best offense.”
Although the seniors were 
in the spotlight before the match began, junior Chloe Mann reclaimed her offensive dominance with 12 kills and a .524 hitting clip.
The middle blocker failed 
to crack .200 in her previous two matches but recorded her highest percentage since los-ing to Tennessee 3-2 on Nov. 4. 
Mann has not practiced since 
September to prevent any prior injuries from flaring up down the stretch.
“It’s such a rhythm between 
a setter and a middle hitter, and when you don’t get to practice, you are kind of mak-ing it up on the fly during the 
match,” Wise said. “Think of 
a basketball player scoring at her rate without ever shooting. It makes no sense that she can do what she’s done other than how talented she is.”
Smith and Wiggs also 
chipped in offensively, regis-tering 11 and 10 kills, respec-
tively, en route to their second 
career SEC championship and first since 2010.
Weston, who has played in 
every set in the Gators’ past four matches, said her team grinded it out despite being ranked behind Tennessee and Kentucky in the preseason 
polls. 
“It’s fun to prove people 
wrong,” Weston said. “We 
came in every day and we fought for it, because we be-lieved in ourselves and in each other. We went and took it.”
Smith said she and the rest 
of the senior class felt relieved 
after Wiggs sent the Game-
cocks home with the final kill, securing the team’s 20th SEC title.
“It was just kind of a big 
deep breath like, ‘We did it,’” Smith said. “It wasn’t anyone individually. We all did this to-gether and it’s just such a spe-
cial moment.”Gators win SEC title

Florida 23, Jacksonville St. 0
For the first time since 
Florida’s 14-6 win against LSU on Oct. 6, Gillislee scored a rushing touchdown 
and eclipsed 100 yards on the ground. His 122 rushing yards mark his third-highest 
total this season.
Jacksonville State’s offense stalled after a 76-yard pass on its first play, forcing 
a field goal attempt. Gamecocks kicker Griffin Thomas missed the 25-yard try, setting up the Gators’ first scoring drive.1
Facing the 108th-ranked defense in the 
FCS, Florida’s offense mustered only one 
touchdown. Three Caleb Sturgis field goals 
and Jon Bostic’s pick-six put the game out 
of reach.KEY STAT

Nursing a 10-point lead against its 
FCS visitors, Florida got a big play from linebacker Jon Bostic. Bostic 
picked off a throw from Jacksonville State quarterback Marques Ivory and took it 7 yards to the end zone 
to put the Gators up 17-0.
On Jacksonville State’s first offensive 
play, Ivory completed a short pass to Kevyn Cooper. Cooper broke Marcus Roberson’s tackle and sprinted down the sideline, but Bostic tracked him 
down and made the touchdown-
saving tackle after a 76-yard gain. Facing fourth-and-1 near midfield on its first drive, Florida decided to go for it. The Gators gave the ball to Mike Gillislee , who plowed through 
the line for the crucial yard. It was the fourth of nine straight running 
plays on the Gators’ lone touchdown drive.
Struggling offense looking to get back on track before facing FSU
But, as has been the case most of the season, 
the offense struggled . UF converted on just  of 
11 third-down chances.
Mike Gillislee was one of the few bright 
spots. He ran for 122 yards on 20 carries to 
mark his first 100-yard effort since Florida’s 
14-6 win against LSU on Oct. 6.
The yards won’t come as easily against the 
Seminoles, who field the nation’s best run de-fense at 70.6 yards allowed per game.
Jacoby Brissett completed 14 of 22 passes for 154 yards on Saturday . During the coming week, Muschamp will have to decide whether Brissett or Jeff Driskel will start against FSU. Driskel missed Saturday’s game due to a sprained right ankle. 
Muschamp said he made a conscious effort 
to focus on the run game but was happy with Brissett’s play. Still, he reiterated that he’d like to see the offense make more progress.
“We need to get more production offen-
sively ,” Muschamp said. “We can’t continue to self-inflict wounds on ourselves as far as the penalties and different mistakes that we make.”
FSU also improved to 10-1 with a 41-14 win 
against Maryland on Saturday . The Gators and Seminoles rank third and fifth in the country, respectively , in scoring defense. Bostic said he expects the game to reflect the statistics.
“We know they’ve got a great defense, 
and so do we,” Bostic said. “It’s going to be a battle. ... It’s definitely going to be a defensive 
game.”
UF’s game against FSU took on added im-
portance Saturday night as Oregon and Kan-
sas State were upset. With a win against FSU and a USC upset of Notre Dame next week, UF would likely face the SEC champion for the national title.
Although the win against the Gamecocks 
sent the seniors out of The Swamp for the last time with a win, Wilson said his class already has another goal in mind for when the Gators take the field in Tallahassee.
“We’ve got to switch those bragging rights 
over to Gainesville,” Wilson said. “We’ll make it happen.”
