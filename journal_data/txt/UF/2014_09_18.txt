A water main broke Tuesday 
afternoon in Newberry causing a 
precautionary boil-water notice for the city.
Construction on the 25400 block 
of Southwest 15th Avenue caused 
the break, said Blaine Suggs, the utilities director for Newberry. Wa-
ter was shut off for four hours.
A rolling boil of one minute is 
sufﬁ  cient, and Suggs said the ban won’t be lifted until the city receives test results.
“In order for the notice to end, 
water samples have to be sent to a state-certiﬁ  ed lab for bacteriological clearance,” Suggs said.
Suggs said the city sent a code-
red alert out to residents about the precautionary boil-water notice.“The same process will be used 
to alert all residents as soon as the water is safe to use again,” he said.
Suggs said it’s unknown how 
much water spilled out during the break.
“It disrupts their life, naturally,” 
Suggs said. “People want to know when they can start using the water to cook again.”
Nareth Meth, owner of Cilantro 
Taco in Newberry, said the notice af-
fected business.
“We’ve been buying ice from 
Sam’s Club for the past few days,” 
Meth said. “I’ve seen some decline in customers over the last few days because of this.” Precautionary boil-water notice in City of Newberry

Go to Midtown on any 
given night, and you’ll ex-
perience quintessential 
Gainesville — a tidal wave 
of singles on the prowl. 
You might leave wonder-
ing: “Is everyone single?” 
The answer is, for the 
most part, yes. 
According to a report pub-
lished Monday by The At-lantic City Lab, Gainesville 
leads the country’s metro 
cities with the greatest share of adult singles: a whopping 62.1 percent of the popula-
tion. 
The report deﬁ  ned single 
as someone who is not mar-ried, and singles accounted for 51.2 percent of the U.S. 
population last year.
Four other college towns 
top the list, including Ithaca, New York; College Station, 
Texas; Tallahassee; and Law-
rence, Kansas. 
UF family, youth and 
community sciences profes-
sor Victor Harris said it may 
just be a matter of context. 
“I highly suspect it’s 
mostly a phenomenon of ﬁ  ll-ing up the town with single 
people who are going to 
school,” Harris said. 
Between UF and Santa 
Fe College, students make 
up about 53 percent of the Gainesville leads 
nation in singles

Long lines were expected at the UF Student 
Health Care Center on Friday, but the annual 
ﬂ  u kick-off has been postponed.
Shipments containing between 8,000 and 
9,000 ﬂ  u shots will not arrive on time to help 
the UF community combat the ﬂ  u.
Catherine Seemann, communications coor-
dinator for SHCC, said it is unfortunate that 
the supply of ﬂ  u shots has been delayed.
“Unfortunately, we can’t control when 
shipment comes in,” she said. “The most infor-mation we have right now is we’ll likely have them for mid-October.”
This will be the third consecutive year the 
SHCC has hosted a kick-off event for ﬂ  u shots. In 2012, 500 vaccinations were given in the ﬁ  rst 
day the ﬂ  u shots were available. The number 
increased to 1,008 ﬂ  u shots in 2013. Seemann said the center is aiming to give 1,500 vaccina-tions during the re-scheduled kickoff event.
“We see a huge drop-off in students who 
receive vaccinations after the Thanksgiving holiday,” she said. “We try to get them vacci-nated early before the ﬂ  u starts circulating.”Flu season peaks between January and 
February, Seemann said. The SHCC ran out of ﬂ  u shots last January.
The center is conscious of the health fee 
that students pay, however, every ﬂ  u shot that is not used is destroyed, which is a waste of fee dollars, Seemann said.
The Alachua County Health Department 
will also be on campus for the ﬁ  rst time, offer-ing the nasal spray FluMist.
Paul Myers, administrator of the depart-
ment, said the beneﬁ  ts of FluMist make it a better option for anyone afraid of shots.
“FluMist prevents against the ﬂ  u and infec-
tions,” he said. “That means it’s also prevent-ing against the spreading of the ﬂ  u.”
A date has not been set for the arrival of 
FluMist on campus, as the department does not want to compete with the SHCC.
The option of a ﬂ  u shot or FluMist would 
give more students a chance to receive the ﬂ  u vaccine, Myers said. 
Camille Jamshidi, a 20-year-old UF Span-
ish junior, missed out on the chance of getting vaccinated in the Spring semester when the SHCC ran out.
“I saw people getting vaccinated but by the 
time I thought about actually getting it, it was too late,” she said.Flu shot kickoff delayed after vaccine shipments don’t arrive on time“It disrupts their life, 
naturally.”

� MEN ASKED TO FIGHT 
AGAINST SEXUAL ASSAULT.
MAHOGANY BROWN
Alligator Contributing Writer
As UF tackles sexual assault 
awareness, the White House is tak-
ing on its own campaign to address the issue. 
President Barack Obama will un-
veil a campus sexual awareness cam-paign titled “It’s On Us” on Friday encouraging men to join the ﬁ  ght to stop sexual assaults. 
Jacqueline Adadi, a 21-year-old 
public relations senior, said Obama’s upcoming announcement comes at the right time to deal with UF’s sexu-al assault cases. 
“I think it’s great that the govern-
ment wants to take a more proactive role in what’s going on on college campuses,” she said. 
Rita Lawrence, the coordinator 
for UF’s interpersonal violence pre-vention peer education group, said the ads that have been circulated are 
not only geared toward men. 
“It’s more about supporting the 
survivors of sexual violence,” she 
said. “It is not targeted towards a speciﬁ  c group.”
Lawrence said that best way to 
raise awareness about sexual as-saults is through being educated on the topic. 
“I would highly encourage every-
one, no matter their gender identity, to take classes that deal with oppres-sion in any of its forms, whether that be due to gender, race, class, ability, sexual orientation, education, size or socio-economic status,” she said.UF reacts to Obama plan

A new organic market will open west of 13th 
Street next semester, featuring fresh meat, local 
produce and a juice bar.
Lucky’s Market will open at 1409 NW 23rd 
Ave. this January in Verde Plaza, said Ben Fried-
land, vice president of marketing for Lucky’s.
“We offer the highest-quality products at the 
lowest price,” he said. “But at the same time we 
also offer conventional items you ﬁ  nd in your typi-cal grocery store. Lucky’s is a one-stop shop.”
The 28,000-square-foot organic-food market 
will offer pre-prepared meals, fresh-baked pizza, in-house smoked bacon and “never ever” meats — meats that are never treated with antibiotics or 
growth hormones, Friedland said.
“Ninety percent of the items we carry are natu-
ral and organic,” he said.The Gainesville location will be the Colorado-
based grocery store’s ﬁ  rst Florida store, and Fried-
land said Gainesville was picked for its vibrant community and variety of cuisines.
The new store will be added competition for 
Ward’s Supermarket, a family-owned and locally-
operated grocery store located two minutes away.
“I think the advantage we have is we’ve been 
local for 63 years,” owner Trish Ward said. “We’re 
truly the only locally owned supermarket in Gainesville.”
Jen Speedy, a 21-year-old UF dietetics senior, 
said she researched Lucky’s after she heard it was coming to town.
“Colorado is such a health-conscious state as it 
is,” Speedy said. “Just to know that’s ﬁ  nally com-ing this way is incredible.”
Speedy, who juices regularly, said she’s excited 
for Lucky’s to open because it can be difﬁ  cult for students to eat healthy on small budgets.Organic market to open in JanuaryGainesville population, according

“Eighty to 90 percent of people 
will still get married at some point in their lives,” Harris said. 
They may just be waiting until 
after college.
Some students insist Gaines-
ville’s party culture is leading to more hookups and fewer serious relationships. 
Britany Holmes, a 22-year-old 
Santa Fe nursing student who transferred from UF, said she’s ab-stained from relationships since her freshman year.
“I just realized that I didn’t re-
ally have time to maintain any re-lationships,” Holmes said. “Every-one’s out there looking to hook up, and if you are someone looking for 
a stable relationship, your choices are slim to none.” 
She said social media and tech-
nology play a large part in the dis-
solution of dating culture. 
“I’m sitting here and trying to 
make a future for myself,” she said. “I don’t want some guy who’s go-
ing to drag me to Midtown every 
night.”
Amy Clark, a 20-year-old UF fi-
nance junior, sees both sides of the spectrum often. 
She is getting married in Decem-
ber to her high school boyfriend, Jordan Clear, but the majority of her friends have never dated.
“I think that people who are in 
relationships tend to be in serious ones, and people who aren’t tend to like it that way,” Clark said. “It just kind of depends if you value that 
person and that relationship over 
what singleness has to offer.”4, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 18, 2014

Students who steered clear of 
Sorority and Fraternity Row this 
semester in favor of a more inde-
pendent and alternative lifestyle 
can still rush today on Plaza of the Americas. 
Radical Rush, an organiza-
tional fair featuring 25 different alternative groups throughout Gainesville, will be on campus from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Some of the groups that will be there include 
The Fine Print, Wild Iris Books, Gainesville Roller Rebels and UF 
Amnesty International. The fair 
was also on campus Wednesday 
and at Santa Fe College earlier in the week. 
One of the event organizers, 
Kenzie Cooke, said, “The traffic 
here at UF has been fairly steady, 
especially since the study abroad fair is going on.”
The Civic Media Center, a lo-
cal alternative library and reading room, started Radical Rush in 1998 as a response to Greek rush week, said Nailah Summers, 26, who is also an event coordinator.
The fair’s goal is to show stu-
dents both on- and off-campus alternative groups, Summers said, the majority of which are political-ly focused and community based.
On Friday, the Civic Media 
Center will host a pizza party and karaoke at 7 p.m. — another op-portunity for the groups to social-ize with each other, Cooke, 22, said.  
“It’s a chance to build bridges 
with the vendors and the new vol-unteers,” she said.
Gainesville Citizens for Alter-
natives to the Death Penalty was 
one of the many vendors at the 
fair, aiming to raise awareness about the death penalty, said Mir-iam Welly Elliott, co-coordinator 
of the group. Volunteers typically 
sign birthday cards and holiday cards for inmates on death row, she said.“There are usually over 400 
cards that we sign,” she said.
The Repurpose Project was also 
at the fair, letting students know about its new location on North-east 23rd Avenue, which will be near Satchel’s, and its mission to 
transform landfill trash like bath-
tubs, sinks and paperclips into sellable items
“Art students love us because 
we have a lot of useful material for them and their art,” said Lau-ren Corley, a 19-year-old UF sus-tainability major.

� “WHAT IS THE GOOD LIFE?”
KRISTINA FLORIO
Alligator Contributing Writer
UF applicants will get a taste of 
freshman frustration when answering 
this year’s essay prompt: “What is the good life?”
Students first pondered this ques-
tion when UF made What is the Good Life? a mandatory class in 2012.
The university is now expanding 
this theme from classroom discus-sions to the essay, which asks students to describe their idea of  a good life.
But for some UF students, the 
question still remains unanswered.   
“At the end of my good life class, 
my professor said, ‘I’m not so sure what the good life is,’” said Rebecca Vitkus, a 20-year-old UF English se-nior. “So does anyone really know?”
UF spokesman Steve Orlando said 
the prompt was chosen as a precursor to the course.
“It allows applicants to reflect on a question that all freshmen students have the chance to explore in the ‘What is the Good Life?’ course,” Or-lando wrote in an email.
He also said the personal essay 
gives Admissions the opportunity to hear from students in a way not avail-able through test scores or activities.
Bruno Paes-Leme, an 18-year-old 
UF biomedical engineering freshman, said exploring the good life is a way for students to embrace individuality.
“I appreciate that they recognize 
that none of us here are blank slates, 
but rather people who are full of rich 
cultures, ideas and aspirations, and that each of us have something of val-ue to bring to the table,” he said.
For Stephanie Diaz, a 19-year-old 
UF health science sophomore, the prompt is too much to ask of high school seniors.
“I think it’s unfair to ask them at 
this stage in their life,” she said. “You don’t really know anything about life yet. I’d have no idea how to answer it.”New UF application essay

Despite cleanup efforts, research by a UF 
professor has found that oil residue still re-
mains in the Gulf of Mexico after the Deep-
water Horizon oil spill.
A team led by Thomas S. Bianchi, profes-
sor of geology and the Jon L. and Beverly A. 
Thompson Endowed Chair of Geological Sci-
ences, found that oil residue from the 2010 
spill is still present in the region, although previous research found otherwise.
Bianchi said the research team returned to 
the Gulf to compare present and 2010 water samples and examine the fluorescent proper-ties of molecules.
“Right after the spill, there were lots of 
fluorescent measurement(s) taken by people 
because it was the quickest way to see what 
was out there,” he said.
While some of the oil left behind was con-
sumed by bacteria and/or vaporized into the atmosphere, Bianchi said other oil molecules have been decomposed and now remain as another type of carbon molecule that is not actually oil — which is why other studies 
didn’t find residue.
According to a press release, UF’s team, 
which was part of a larger group, was funded 
by a grant from BP’s Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative.
Ale Russian, a 20-year-old UF telecommu-
nication junior, said UF’s research will help restore the beaches she used to visit.
“My family used to go to the beach but 
couldn’t go during the oil spill,” she said.Effects of BP oil spill continue

The Gainesville Latino Film Fes-
tival kicked off its 10th anniversary 
Friday with a night of commemorat-ing all the individuals who helped make the event possible for so many 
years.
The festival runs until Oct. 14. 
and celebrates the works of Latinos 
in the entertainment industry with film screenings, folk art displays, a salsa concert and exhibits of Latin culture at several downtown ven-ues including the Hippodrome State Theatre and The Wooly, at 20 N. 
Main St.
During the opening ceremony, 
the Curtis M. Phillips Center for the 
Performing Arts burst with laugh-ter and chatter as a crowd of people from all ethnic backgrounds filled the auditorium. 
A number of people were hon-
ored for their contributions to GLFF 
and the founder, Victoria Condor-
Williams, gave a speech celebrating the 10 years the festival has been ac-tive in the Gainesville community.
“I thought that this medium of 
the art and the cinema can bring an understanding of our commu-nity and the awareness of different kinds of challenges that the Latino 
community face here in the United 
States,” she said.
Eric Segal, education curator of 
academic programs at the Samuel P. Harn Museum of Art, which is host-ing four different film screenings, said the genre of film does not cor-relate with its screening location, but the museum tried to connect the ex-
hibits and the festival. He said they 
made special exhibitions to celebrate the anniversary.
“We have about a half dozen 
works of Latin American art, and we have a larger exhibit on the Kuna people from Panama,” he said
Rosy Padron, a volunteer at UF’s 
Institute of Hispanic-Latino Cul-
tures, said she, as a Latina, feels that 
the events are more of an introduc-tion to the culture for non-Latinos.
However, the 20-year-old UF 
history sophomore said she believes that spreading the Latin culture in Gainesville is important.
“It’s crazy to think that it is even 
happening in Gainesville, and it is 
the 10th  year,” Padron said. “So it is 
cool that it is becoming a tradition.”
Vice president of the Latina 
Women’s League Victoria Gomez de la Torre shared the goals of GLFF and the message the organization hopes to leave with people who at-tend the festival.
“Each one of us from each differ-
ent country that we come from has many different individual identi-ties that we bring with us,” Gomez de la Torre said. “The best way to give that out to the community is by bringing our movies.”Latino Film Festival celebrates 10

A Gainesville man was 
arrested after police say he 
tried to rob a UF Health em-ployee on his way to work early Wednesday morning.
James Brence Roberts Jr., 
25, approached the victim at about 2 a.m. as he was walk-ing across the street to work, according to a report. 
“Give me all your s***,” 
Roberts said to the victim while in the crosswalk. 
The victim said he feared 
for his safety and backed away from Roberts running north toward UF Health. As he ran, Roberts tried to hit the victim with his backpack and fist. 
After telling Roberts he 
was going to call the police, the victim said Roberts threw down his bag and started to unzip it. 
The victim ran toward a 
UF Health security guard and said someone was trying to rob him. 
UF Health notified the Uni-
versity Police, who detained Roberts until Gainesville Po-lice arrived. 
Roberts was arrested for 
attempted robbery. His bond in Alachua County Jail is set at $50,000

A Gainesville man was 
arrested on kidnapping and battery charges after police say he kicked a 6-year-old girl and forced her friend in-side his house. 
Donald Mobley, 61, got 
upset with two girls, ages 6 and 8, who were playing on the steps in front of his apart-
ment at 1725 NE Eighth Ave. 
shortly before 6 p.m. Tues-day. As the 6-year-old ran by, Mobley kicked her in the leg, according to a report. 
Shortly after, Mobley in-
vited the 8-year-old into his 
apartment to play the drums. 
She declined, and he became 
angry. 
Mobley grabbed the 
8-year-old by the arm, pulled her inside his apartment and 
blocked the door. 
An 8-year-old boy and a 
14-year-old girl saw what 
was happening and pounded 
on Mobley’s door, trying to 
force entry.
After pushing the door 
open, the children yelled for 
the victim to escape and she 
did.
None of the children were 
injured. 
Mobley was convicted of 
molesting a child in 2001. 
His bond is set at $105,000 
in Alachua County Jail.

NATION
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
School police departments across the coun-
try have taken advantage of free military sur-
plus gear, stocking up on mine-resistant ar-mored vehicles, grenade launchers and scores of M16 rifles.
At least 26 school districts have participat-
ed in the Pentagon’s surplus program, which is not new but has come under scrutiny after police responded to protesters in Ferguson, Missouri, last month with tear gas, armored military trucks and riot gear.
Now, amid that increased criticism, several 
school districts say they’ll give some of the equipment back.
Nearly two dozen education and civil lib-
erties groups sent a letter earlier this week to the Pentagon and the justice and education departments urging a stop to transfers of mili-tary weapons to school police.
The Los Angeles Unified School District 
— the nation’s second-largest school district covering 710 square miles and enrolling more than 900,000 students — said it would remove three grenade launchers it had acquired be-cause they “are not essential life-saving items within the scope, duties and mission” of the district’s police force.
But the district plans to keep the 60 M16s 
and a military vehicle — known as an MRAP 
— used in Iraq and Afghanistan that was built 
to withstand mine blasts.
District police Chief Steve Zipperman told 
The Associated Press that the M16s are used for training, and the MRAP, which is parked off campus, was acquired because the district could not afford to buy armored vehicles that might be used to protect officers and help stu-dents in a school shooting.
Law enforcement agencies around the 
country equipped themselves during learner budget years by turning to the Pentagon pro-gram, which the Defense Department has used to get rid of gear it no longer needs. Since the Columbine school shooting in 1999, school districts increasingly participated.
Federal records show schools in Florida, 
Georgia, Kansas, Michigan, Nevada, Texas 
and Utah obtained surplus military gear. At 
least six California districts have received equipment, state records show.
In response to police tactics after a white 
policeman fatally shot an unarmed black 18-year-old in Ferguson, the White House said it would review the surplus program, and Congress plans hearings on it.
U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said while 
there’s a role for surplus equipment going to local police departments, “it’s difficult to see what scenario would require a grenade launcher or a mine resistant vehicle for a school police department.”
In Florida, Rick Stelljes, the chief of Pinellas 
County Schools police, said Wednesday that the county has 28 semi-automatic M16 rifles. They have never been used, and he hopes they 
are never needed.
But, he said, they are “something we need 
given the current situation we face in our na-
tion. This is about preparing for the worst-case scenario.”

I am many things, but wealthy isn’t one of them.
Of course, most Floridians — and Americans — aren’t 
wealthy either.
The only real wealth I have to my name is whatever is left 
over from my Bright Futures payment. While these checks 
give me enough to get by, there are people who give a lot 
more money to universities than the government would ever consider giving to me or any other student.
I’m referring to the donors that help ﬁ  nance UF and every 
other institute of higher learning in the U.S.
The donor-university relationship is a win for both sides. 
Universities need money to function, and generous donors get their names engraved on campus buildings. Generous donations can help keep tuition costs lower than they other-
wise would be, leaving me more money to spend at Moe’s.
Unfortunately, there are downsides to the reliance of uni-
versities on these wealthy donors. Occasionally, donors want 
more than being immortalized on the new football stadium or math building. Sometimes, these donations come with strings attached. The larger the donation, the more inﬂ  uence the benefactor wields.
In 2007, the Charles Koch Foundation — the charitable or-
ganization of one of the notorious Koch brothers — offered 
to donate a total of $7 million to the economics department at 
Florida State University. In exchange for this massive dona-tion, the foundation asked, in the words of FSU economics chair Bruce Benson, “to expose students to what they believe are vital concepts about the beneﬁ  ts of the market and the dangers of government failure. Therefore, they are trying to convince us to hire faculty who will provide that exposure and mentoring.”
The Koch Foundation was essentially attempting to buy 
the right to inﬂ  uence the curriculum and hiring policies of FSU’s economics department. Although the arrangement was never implemented, the Kochs have spread a total of $12.7 million around universities across the nation, with about $300,000 going to FSU.
The Kochs aren’t alone in their quest to inﬂ  uence pub-
lic education. George Soros, the billionaire often described as the liberal version of the Koch brothers, has also donated large sums to American universi-ties. This year, several schools re-ported receiving their largest do-nations of all time.
These donations by the Kochs, 
Soros and others point to a danger-ous trend: The ability of wealthy donors to inﬂ  uence what Amer-ica’s college students are taught and to design college curricula ac-
cording to their own political ideologies.
It’s unreasonable to expect such large donations to come 
with no strings attached whatsoever. Every gift comes with implicit inﬂ  uence. The problem occurs when donors try to 
use this position to sway university and academic decisions.
Take the case of Steven Salaita, a researcher of Native 
American studies whose new position at the University of Il-
linois was declined after a series of critical Israel tweets came to public attention. While Salaita’s actions certainly made a lot of people angry, new evidence suggests that Salaita lost his position because UI’s large donors threatened to with-hold funding if he wasn’t terminated. 
Of the emails collected by Mondoweiss journalist Phan 
Nguyen, one message contained a summary of a meeting with one of the university’s top donors who told Universi-ty Chanecllor Phyllis Wise she and two other donors were watching the Salaita situation closely. The donor advised that the way the university would choose to handle the issue would be “very telling.”
The Salaita case and the attempts of the Kochs and oth-
ers to buy inﬂ  uence in American education are all deeply troubling. The correspondence between Wise and the donor 
reveals the lines between donor inﬂ  uence and academic free-
dom are becoming blurred, if they even still exist.
People who consciously use their wealth to inﬂ  uence aca-
demic policies compromise the integrity of our schools. The growing inﬂ  uence of these donors on American education beneﬁ  ts no one but the donors themselves.

must vote to end 
MTR coal use
Gainesville has gained a reputation for being a city on the cutting edge of clean energy technology. Gainesville Re-gional Utilities, the city’s primary energy provider, has 
demonstrated a clear and consistent commitment to developing alternative energy sources.
According to the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, Gainesville 
is “among the world leaders” in solar energy per capita. The Gainesville Renewable Energy Center, a biomass plant that be-gan operation in December 2013, is another example of the city’s commitment to encouraging the use of clean energy.
Despite GRU’s innovations, the company continues to rely 
on one of the most noxious and environmentally devastating en-ergy resources in America: coal extracted through the practice of mountaintop-removal (MTR) mining.
Gainesville may not be near any mountains, but it partici-
pates in the vicious cycle of MTR all the same. The Deerhaven Generating Station, Gainesville’s coal-ﬁ  red power plant, uses MTR coal from a number of Appalachian sources.
MTR is exactly what it sounds like; energy companies set up 
shop on a mountain in Appalachia — West Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky and other southern states — and then use explosives to blow the mountain’s top off.
The practice of MTR allows coal to be extracted more quickly 
and efﬁ  ciently, but it also has dire consequences for the environ-ment and for the health of surrounding populations.
Mountaintop-removal mining usually takes place near im-
poverished communities in rural Appalachia. The toxic chem-icals released during the MTR process ﬁ  nd their way into the local populations’ supply of drinking water. Those who cannot afford to purchase a constant supply of bottled water are forced to drink water that may be extremely hazardous to their health.
The effects of MTR on the communities of Appalachia are 
devastating. People who live in areas where large-scale MTR oc-curs have lower average life expectancies, higher rates of lung cancer and other serious and disproportionate health concerns.
The harmful effect that MTR has on the people of Appalachia 
demonstrates this is a social problem as well as an environmen-tal one. GRU has already begun to phase out its use of coal, espe-cially coal obtained through MTR, but a gradual decline in this practice is simply not enough.
Tonight, the Gainesville City Commission will vote on a pro-
posal advanced by Commissioner Lauren Poe to end GRU’s use of MTR coal. Poe will need “Yes” votes from at least three other commissioners for the policy to take effect. The commission pre-viously voted unanimously to condemn the practice of MTR, but condemning the practice and actually ending Gainesville’s role in it are two very different things.
The commission has an opportunity to set an example for 
the rest of the nation by voting to end Gainesville’s use of coal 
produced through MTR. Eliminating Gainesville’s role in this 
harmful and devastating practice is a step toward a cleaner and safer environment for all Americans.

Double entendres, sexual innuendos and clever marketing.
As children and tweens, those words were — to us — unin-
telligible, unpronounceable and definitely unimportant. How-ever, we were consuming a healthy dose of all three every time we sang along to pop songs.
Sold to us and our wildly negligent par-
ents as innocent music, the pop tunes we all knew and loved in the 1990s and early 2000s were subtly filthy enough to impregnate a child’s ear canal. Everybody pointed fingers at rap music, but the real culprits in the col-lective corruption of America’s youth were the likes of Britney and Justin, and not just 
because of their matching, all-denim outfits at the American 
Music Awards in 2001. 
Take a trip down memory lane, and revisit the filthy ditties 
we knew and loved during our more chaste years. 
“...Baby One More Time” by Britney Spears (1999)
It would be remiss to not mention Britney Spears right off 
the bat in a discussion of sexually charged pop anthems. She practically invented the “pseudogenre.” The Princess of Pop exploded into our collective subconscious with “...Baby One More Time.” In the video for the album’s title track, Spears 
writhed around on lockers and shimmied her virginal rack at a 
camera all while sporting a schoolgirl uniform fit for bedroom foreplay.  Oh, and this went down while Spears swore she was a virgin. 
Plus, the racy video foreshadowed what was to come for 
Spears: “Slave 4 U,” the  infamous Madonna kiss at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards and Kevin Federline. 
Hats off to Spears’ marketing team for pulling a fast one on 
all our parents. 
“Genie In A Bottle” by Christina Aguilera (1999)“Hormones racing at the speed of light / But that don’t 
mean it’s gotta be tonight.” 
These words sound like they came from a grammatically 
incorrect pamphlet at Planned Parenthood. Alas, they are the lyrics to Aguilera’s “Genie In A Bottle” in which the then-bare-ly legal singer pleaded, or demanded, to be “rubbed the right way” so she could make someone’s wishes come true. 
Hey Christina, can I make a wish? Go back in time and undo 
the video for “Dirrty.” I had to purchase Plan B for my eyes. 
“Who Let The Dogs Out” by Baha Men (2000)The Baha Men obviously thought they would get away with 
making offensive music by singing in what could be mistaken for a foreign language, but the jig is up. I won’t deny “Who Let The Dogs Out” is a catchy tune, but let’s just say it wouldn’t be Gloria Steinem’s favorite. 
The “dogs” in question are of the human variety if you catch 
my drift. There’s a lot of talk about “nuttin’” and “bones,” and 
they’re definitely not talking about PB&J and dog treats. 
In a perfect world, there would exist an episode of “The Of-
fice” where Michael Scott leads a sexual harassment workshop 
with “Who Let The Dogs Out” as PowerPoint background mu-sic. 
Fun fact: This song was featured in the “Rugrats in Paris” 
movie. Let that sink in.‘I’m not that

If you’re expecting a show named 
after Batman’s crime-ridden home-
town to be about the Dark Knight himself, Fox’s “Gotham” will turn off that mental bat signal.
The show centers instead around 
a smaller but still crucial character in the DC Comics narrative, Detec-tive James (Jim) Gordon (played by “Southland” and “The OC” veteran Ben McKenzie). 
The pre-commissioner Gordon 
and his brash but lackadaisical partner Harvey Bullock (played by Donal Logue) are paired up to navi-gate the city’s dark depths in the years before Bruce Wayne became Batman.
Described as an “origin story,” 
the show’s premise also features the beginnings of some of the beloved comic universe’s most notorious villains. 
In the pilot alone, there are at 
least four big-time baddies that are either seen or name dropped. Pen-guin, Riddler, Poison Ivy, Catwom-an – the gang’s all there, and they haven’t even mor-phed into their psychotic and, in some cases, homi-cidal maniac selves yet!
It’s an intriguing premise and 
the angle is refreshing, particularly for longtime fans of the brand. 
A lot of mysterious seeds are 
planted in the first episode: How ex-actly is Harvey involved with crime boss Fish Mooney (a new character created for the show, played by Jada Pinkett Smith)? 
What is Jim’s fiancee Barbara 
(played by Erin Richards) hiding? And, of course, the timeless ques-tion that has been debated for years: Who murdered Bruce Wayne’s par-ents?
McKenzie’s Gordon is strong-
willed but hesitant. Being thrust into a world where the crime bosses and police department intermingle is tough, but McKenzie keeps his character grounded in realism rath-er than bravado. The ensemble cast is diverse. Logue’s Bullock is full of exas-
perated sighs and sarcastic remarks that only give glimpses of the anx-ious man underneath. 
Robin Taylor’s Oswald Cobble-
pot is sneaky, slimy and overall pitiful — the precise formula for the makings of a true bad guy. 
And the pre-teen Bruce Wayne 
(played by David Mazouz) is only just beginning to navigate his dark path, but not before he and Gordon form a connection that will prove to be crucial in years to come.  
There are a lot of mysteries to 
solve in “Gotham,” from police cas-es to back-alley deals.
 As Bullock says in one moment, 
“You can’t have organized crime without law and order.” 
To see how these characters and 
storylines intertwine might prove to be quite the riddle.
Check out the premiere of 
“Gotham” on Monday at 8 p.m. on FOX.

By the time this goes to print, 
a mixed army of ultra-fem and 
utilitarian sportswear-clad su-permodels (and their respective wake of editors, photographers, bloggers and street-style influ-encers) will have already hop-scotched from New York to Lon-don to Milan, now embarking on day two of Milan Fashion Week. 
And while clothing revelers 
everywhere wait for the other stiletto shoe to drop in Milan, they can at least recount the highlights of the first leg of the Spring 2015 fashion weeks, and that’s New York Fashion Week.
Heavy hitters Marc Jacobs, 
Ralph Lauren, Rag & Bone and Proenza Schouler suited up for a luxurious style safari. 
Field jackets with oversize 
satin pockets gave Marc Jacobs women a no-muss no-fuss atti-tude, and the brave beauty deci-sion to go barefaced surely had makeup brands squirming in their seats. 
Cargo pants and belted 
satin gowns with waist-high slits ruled at Ralph Lauren, while Rag & Bone and Proenza Schouler’s take on military maj-esty conjured up neutral palettes splashed with digitized camo or reptilian scales saturated in pri-mary colors, respectively.
Though Tommy Hilfiger was 
more Sergeant Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club than intimidatingly fashionable army, the military inspirations were definitely there amidst a uniform of garnet and black pinstriped shirts, coats and slacks. 
Double-breasted jackets gave 
way to star-spangled sweaters and day dresses, and all the In-stagram world seemed to stop when Kendall Jenner emerged in a skimpy scalloped bikini. 
While the military look flexed 
its muscles in one corner of the style ring, ladylike glamor as feminine as they come reigned supreme in the next.
Guardian of all-things-glam, 
Diane von Furstenberg tossed a handful of on-point trends onto her runway. 
Flirty florals weaved them-
selves through colorful coats, sultry skirts and floor-length gowns, while a peppering of gingham peeked out from be-neath black and white or tropi-cal tints, breathing a breath of the unexpected into the classic collection. 
And if anyone suspected von 
Furstenberg’s dethroning any time soon, one need only look to the show’s final look: A purse-lipped, smirking Naomi Camp-bell strutted down the catwalk, reminding everyone who outfits the truly fabulous women of the world.

Hundreds of fans and curious walk-ins alike 
packed into The Motor Room downtown Friday 
night. For a venue known for its Deep End and Neon Liger parties, The Motor Room hosted a bit 
of a different party.
Local musicians Bells and Robes showcased 
their new EP “One Should See Sound” with a spec-
tacular listening party, organized in a joint effort between recently partnered UF’s Swamp Records 
and Gainesville-based music streaming service 
Grooveshark.
“We wanted to pack out (The Motor Room),” 
said Swamp Records president Breana Auberry. 
“We also wanted students to realize we have talent 
here. We want them to realize they don’t have to go 
out of town to see good music.”
Swamp Records gave Bells and Robes a perfor-
mance slot at a showcase last spring. 
From there, the two formed a unique partner-
ship, with Bells and Robes creating music for re-lease and Swamp Records helping the producers 
with promotion and graphic design for its brand.
“Swamp (Records) helped gives us two incred-
ible graphic designers who create art that exactly 
matches our music,” said Bells and Robes member 
Dean Spaniol.  He met fellow Bells and Robes member Luke 
Sipka at UF — the two collected records and were 
inspired to create their own.
“On the day of the 2012 summer solstice, we 
wrote a contract under penalty of death to finish an EP by the winter solstice of the same year,” Sipka 
said.
They stayed true to their con-
tract: The two put out an EP in the 
following months and have now 
released their latest “livetronica” 
(electronic music with live instru-
ments) EP.
The two have a do-it-yourself 
set-up to produce their music, 
and they cite Led Zeppelin, Flying Lotus, Pink 
Floyd and the Gorillaz as their biggest influences.
Grooveshark exclusively hosted “One Should 
See Sound” on its platform and promoted the re-
lease on the front page of the website for a week.
“It gets people aware of the partnership be-
tween Swamp Records and Grooveshark,” said 
Grooveshark artist coordinator Jason Rubel. 
“It also gets new audiences to hear Bells and 
Robes’ music,” he said.
Swamp and Grooveshark have another listen-
ing party for local band The Savants of Soul sched-uled for Nov. 14.Local duo drops new album via

Wanderers downtown Friday night found 
it hard to miss the bat signal projected on the 
face of the Hippodrome State Theatre. 
That night it wasn’t a distress call for Bat-
man but a signal from the Lubee Bat Conser-vancy.
According to its website, the conservan-
cy, an international, nonprofit organization 
whose mission is to save bats through re-
search and conservation breeding, put on a series of engagements throughout the week-end called Spot the Bat to strengthen public 
awareness of the organization’s efforts and 
bat conservation in general. 
On Friday, the organization illuminated 
the Hippodrome from 9 p.m. to midnight 
with its bat signal, a green circle that con-
tained the black outline of a cartoon bat and 
read “Lubee BAT CONSERVANCY” and 
“SpotTheBat.com.”
“The idea is to kind of call out to all the 
bat-friendly folks in Gainesville,” said An-
thony Mason, a development coordinator at 
Lubee Bat Conservancy.
The organization also recruited about 16 volunteers to dress in glossy black bat wings 
from noon to 5 p.m. Saturday and go about their daily lives, creating a buzz for Lubee among the gameday preparations. 
The volunteers, who 
were Santa Fe College Teaching Zoo students and 
conservancy staff mem-
bers, formed a cloud of hu-
man bats.
Curious passers-by 
asked the volunteers about 
Spot the Bat and were entered to win a pri-
vate tour at Lubee if they uploaded a picture 
with the group to Instagram tagged with @
lubeebatconservancy and the hashtag #Spot-TheBat.
Jenna McMichael and Alex Henwood, 
keepers at the Lubee Bat Conservancy, said 
they both think the event achieved that goal. 
Bats are important in their ecosystems be-
cause of pollination and seed dispersal and 
are not to be feared.
Bats are responsible for 95 to 98 percent of 
rainforest regrowth, McMichael said.
“We think that being part of the local com-
munity is really going to drive change for the species,” Mason said.See bat symbols in the sky?

The matchup between Florida and Alabama on Satur-
day will feature the Southeastern Conference’s leading re-
ceiver, a member of the Biletnikoff Award watch list and 
one of the nation’s most potent deep-route threats.
Amari Cooper will be there too.
In just two games, Florida’s Demarcus Robinson has 
stolen the spotlight from Cooper in the SEC after recording 
21 catches for 339 yards, including three touchdowns.
His 169.5 receiving yards per game paces the SEC and 
is second in the country.
The sophomore’s 15-reception performance against 
Kentucky — which tied Carlos Alvarez’s school record set back in 1969 — was enough for him to earn a spot on the 
Biletnikoff Award watch list Tuesday.
Robinson also became the ﬁ  rst Gator to have two 
straight 100-yard games since Jabar Gaffney in 2001.
“At times, I was like ‘Man, is Demarcus (Robinson) 
the only receiver we have? It felt like every time he was the one catching the ball,” center Max Garcia said. “Yeah, really impressed in how he performed against Kentucky and really excited to see him develop because he’s still 
very young and defenses are going to have to game plan 
against him, which is only going to leave other receivers open. So we’re going to need him.”
Robinson, a four-star receiver out of Fort Valley, Ga., 
was expected to make this kind of impact as a freshman in 2013.
But off-the-ﬁ  eld issues limited him to making just ﬁ  ve 
catches in seven games.
Now with his suspensions behind him, Robinson has 
made his mark on Florida’s offense as the Gators’ No. 1 receiver.

Dante Fowler can’t rush the quar-
terback by himself.
The junior Buck linebacker is the 
only player on Florida’s defense that 
has more than two quarterback hur-ries on the season.
Against Kentucky on Saturday, 
Fowler ﬁ  nished the triple-overtime win with four of UF’s nine quarter-back hurries.
“We scheme around teams and 
around those schemes we have jobs 
to do,” Fowler said. 
“So we’ve got to sit by them jobs 
and our job is to, you know, contain 
the quarterback and that’s what we 
did.”
Because of Kentucky’s fast pace on 
Saturday — the Wildcats ran 78 plays 
— Florida did not have the opportu-nity to sub out its defensive linemen as often as it hoped to, and it showed on the ﬁ  eld.
“I think both teams looked a little 
gassed by the end of the game, but that’s just part of it,” UF defensive coordinator D.J. Durkin said. “I think our guys played with really good ef-
fort, competed well and they were 
still making plays and pressuring at times at the end.”
When the Gators head to Tusca-
loosa, Ala., to take on the No. 3 Crim-
son Tide on Saturday, Durkin plans 
to rotate between eight and 10 guys on the defensive line.
And with Alabama having a trio 
of running backs in T.J. Yeldon, Der-rick Henry and Kenyan Drake that can carry their own against Florida, the defensive line needs consistency UF working on pass rush

Jameis Winston doesn’t care.
That’s the only explanation I have for 
his latest off the ﬁ  eld wrongdoing, alleg-
edly standing up in the FSU student union 
and saying an obscene phrase out loud for 
all to hear. It was passed around Twitter on 
Tuesday, and it was announced Wednesday that the reigning Heisman trophy winner will sit out of the ﬁ  rst half of what will be one of Florida State’s toughest tests — Clemson.
Saying things like “how can he not under-
stand who he is?” and “he has to be more self aware” aren’t giving Winston enough credit. He would truly have to be an idiot to not get the status he has on campus. Those things are 
often said by onlookers that can’t fathom how 
he keeps popping up on the negative side of the news cycle.
I just don’t think anyone can be that 
dense. 
So I have a counter to that notion: What if 
Winston does get it, what if he does grasp his status on the national scale but he just doesn’t really care what you or I think?
To the victor go the spoils in this society, 
and everyday walking around Tallahassee they are shoved in Winston’s face. His Heisman, the team’s success and the atten-
tion paid to him. 
Just the mere fact something Win-ston said in jest became a half 
suspension in one of the biggest games of his season is testament enough to his reach. 
On social media I see everyone being so 
puzzled with how these things keep on hap-pening and I keep coming back to the idea 
that maybe Winston’s just apathetic to your 
tweets and your outrage — that he probably isn’t looking at anyway given coach Jimbo Fisher’s team-wide in-season ban on social media use.
To be clear: I don’t think Jameis Winston’s 
attitude is a good thing. I don’t think it’s the best idea to conduct yourself with an “only God can judge me” attitude. In fact I think it’s pretty juvenile to do so when you have Winston just doesn’t care

Every athlete’s senior year is sup-
posed to be special but Karina Guts-
che’s final season has taken a differ-ent route.
After suffering from a sprained 
MCL in the preseason, Gutsche has been limited to the bench missing six games. 
But finally returning to the field 
last weekend against New Mexico, she has already defeated her tough-est challenge.
“The biggest obstacle for me 
was just overcoming the fact that I couldn’t play,” Gutsche said. “Sit-ting and watching or not being able to run was kind of difficult for me. I’ve always been playing soccer since I was 3. I think my role switched a little bit and I’ve enjoyed it so far.”
Gutsche’s duty while sitting out 
was being able to guide her team-mates with knowledge.
The senior center defensive back 
committed to her new role of be-ing vocal and enthusiastic with her teammates while on the bench.
Relying on her experience of 
her collegiate career at Florida, has given Gutsche insight on coaching her teammates on different team’s formations.
Mentoring her team while still 
being a part of the roster has aided Florida to a 5-2 record even with her absence from the field.
Now, Gutsche can focus on fin-
ishing her last season as a Gator.  
“With the fact that me being off 
the field and seeing everything I think that helps a lot.” Gutsche said. 
“With just the vision and then once 
I get on the field again, then that might be able to help even more with me playing.”
Playing on the field is where 
coach Becky Burleigh needs Gutsche the most. The Lithia, Fla., native av-eraged 85.54 minutes per match in 2013, which was the second among 
her teammates. Adding to what 
she’s accomplished at Florida, she started all 24 matches last season, was named to the Top Drawer Soc-cer National Team twice in October and is close to recording 3,000 min-utes played at UF.
Returning to the norms of rou-
tine soccer habits isn’t simple. 
However, for Gutsche, getting 
back to playing wasn’t difficult.
“My norms haven’t changed on 
the field. I definitely still try to play as tough as I used to,” Gutsche said. “In the first game I might of been a little hesitant, but that’s just going to come with time on the field. My rit-ual off the field is that I have to now 
put on a brace before I play, which 
is a little different, but that’s nothing for me.”14, ALLIGATOR § THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 18, 2014

Despite having success in their first tournament of the season, 
freshman Brooke Austin and her Florida teammates are just con-
cerned about getting better and growing as a team. 
Austin won her first singles title on Sunday in her first tourna-
ment as a Gator — all without dropping a set.
“I played really well all weekend, so it was nice,” she said. “I 
was just going for my shots and it was working.”
In the final, those shots were working against teammate Kourt-
ney Keegan. But Austin said because everyone on the team is so supportive of one another, playing against her wasn’t difficult.
“It’s exciting because whoever wins, the trophy’s coming back,” 
she said. “Obviously we both wanted to win, but at the end of the day, we’re still teammates. So I was just trying to go out there and have fun.”
Coach Roland Thornqvist said both team-
mates handled the situation exceptionally well.
“They did great,” he said. “Those two, they 
care more about one another than winning the match and it was evident from the first ball. They had great sportsmanship, they applauded each other when the other player did something 
right – it was kinda like how you would hope two teammates end up playing each other.
“And I’m sure with the quality team that we have that it’s gon-
na happen again in the fall, so it was nice to see that the first time it happened that we were able to handle it with class.”
Thornqvist said he thought the team played very well over the 
weekend and he didn’t see any major areas of weakness. 
But he still wants to see improvement from every player, and 
throughout the fall semester, he gives each player a few little things to work on.
The players also put pressure on themselves to improve, and 
Belinda Woolcock, even after coming off a singles title of her own in the first tournament, said she knows everyone’s games can get better.
“I always try and set a few goals for myself every tournament,” 
she said. “In singles I have a few personal ones, but yeah, I think they’re just all about having a really good mentality going in, hav-ing confidence, and in doubles, trying to improve from what we did last week.”
Woolcock said she thinks this year’s Florida team has great 
chemistry, and it’s one of the biggest reasons she is so excited for the season.
“I think we’re having a really good time, all of us,” she said. 
“We’re just having a ball.”Freshman impresses

Durkin wants McCalister, Ball 
more involved in pass rush
from all players.
Durkin looks to Neiron Ball and Alex 
McCalister as two players to help with 
the pass rush.
“Both those guys are good in one-on-
one pass rush,” During said.
The three Crimson Tide running backs 
have combined for 531 rushing yards and 
seven touchdowns so far this season, av-eraging 5.9 yards per rush.
“They’ve got some very good, talent-
ed guys carrying the ball,” Durkin said. 
“They do a great job of getting off blocks 
and tackle well. … They’re good enough to make guys miss and break tackles. We need more guys to get in there.”
The Gators will also be faced with the 
task of defending against a mobile quar-terback for the second week in a row.
After limiting Kentucky quarterback 
Patrick Towles to 22 rush yards on nine attempts, Florida now turns its attention to Alabama senior quarterback Blake Sims.
In three games this season, Sims is av-
eraging 7.3 yards per rush and has two touchdowns on the ground to go with his four touchdown passes and 75-percent pass completion rate.
“I think just the awareness of our guys, 
it’s something that now they’re hearing it for a couple weeks in a row of what we have to do to contain the quarterback,” 
Durkin said. 
“Things are a little different. ... I think 
there’s definitely carryover for those 
guys, and they’re hearing the message for two weeks now.”D-Line , from page 13GRAHAM HALL

David Kilgore is the oldest ath-
lete on Florida’s cross country team, 
but he must feel like the youngest. 
The redshirt junior shares a birth-
day with senior Jimmy Clark on 
Nov. 21, and Eddie Garcia was born 
the day before on the 20th — except David was born a year before both of them, in 1991. 
He’ll turn 23 the day before the 
Gators travel to Terre Haute, Ind., for the NCAA Championship.
But that’s awhile from now.For now, Kilgore is just relieved 
to have gotten his first race as a Gator out of the way – a third place finish at the Western Carolina Invi-tational on Aug. 29.
A reserve runner for two years 
with the 2013 National Champion Colorado Buffaloes, Kilgore trans-ferred to UF this year in an attempt to reignite a collegiate career that saw flashes of greatness in practice and several meets.
But David never truly felt as 
comfortable out west as he did in his 
home state of Florida.
“I did realize when I was out there how much I wanted to come 
back to Florida,” Kilgore said. “I re-alized how much I love Florida.”
�  �  �
David moved to Palm Bay, Fla., 
when he was just 4 years old. His 
parents, Kevin and Dorothy, lived 
in Lakenheath, a village in Suffolk, England. 
But Florida is really the only 
place he can remember.
Slated with an illustrious high 
school career — one that had him named Florida 1A State Champion in 2010, win a FHSAA state cham-
pionship in 2008 and finish on three 
runner-up teams — David headed out west to run at Colorado, which is consistently a cross country pow-erhouse behind 19-year head coach Mark Wetmore.
David was “running with the 
Buffaloes,” a motto so prevalent in the Colorado program that Wet-
more named his season-detailing 
book after it.
He was so excited to join the top 
team in the country, he posted a self-ie of himself in a black and gold Buf-falo shirt to announce his decision.
But David would redshirt his 
freshman year in 2011. 
It wasn’t where he thought he 
would be, but he knew he could grow in the program and only get better as a runner.
“I definitely improved,” Kilgore 
said. “I wouldn’t say I regret it, be-cause I learned a lot, but it’s certainly 
mixed feelings.”
The following year, David would 
run two races as a reserve runner for 
the Buffaloes. 
In his first collegiate race, he fin-
ished 23rd in the Rocky Mountain Shootout.
“We ran a home meet and every-
one on the team does that,” Kilgore 
said. He was just thankful for the op-
portunity, even if he knew he could do more.
He would string together weeks 
of great practices, and showed the potential and endurance that made Colorado assistant coach Billy Nel-son so adamant that Kilgore was right for the program.
Weeks later, Kilgore would lead 
all Colorado runners at the Santa Clara Bronco Invitational, where he would finish 10th. 
Things were looking up. After track season the following 
semester, David was hoping to make the team as a consistent member of the rotation, rather than a reserve runner. He showed in practice that 
he had the speed and endurance to 
be an integral cog in the cross coun-try machine that is the Colorado Buffaloes.
However, when the 2013 season 
rolled around, David again found himself a reserve runner on the team that would go on to win the Nation-al Championship.
Despite his dejection, David 
continued to train and improve. He helped Colorado qualify for the Na-tional Championship by finishing eighth in the Pre-National Invita-tional 8k.
“It was difficult because I really 
saw myself improving, but I don’t have any regrets,” Kilgore said.
But when David committed to 
elevated Colorado over flat Florida, he had no idea that he would have difficulty breathing in the high alti-tude.
Boulder, which sits a cool mile 
above sea level, can give people breathing difficulties. Respiration is shortened, often inducing cough-
ing and tightness in the chest. These 
symptoms aren’t ideal for a sport that requires absolute control of your breathing mechanisms.
The altitude made it nearly im-
possible for David to run at the high-level he had performed at in high school, and it made running nearly unbearable at times.
As hard as he trained, he couldn’t 
overcome the problems that the ele-vation presented him. It seemed like he would either finish his career in mediocrity with Colorado, transfer to another program or quit the sport he loved.
�  �  �
It was difficult to leave, to admit 
you might have made the wrong de-cision when you chose your college destination.
 It felt right for David at the time 
— he had no way of knowing how his lungs would react. He loved his coaches, had made friends and was engaged to a fellow runner on the 
women’s Colorado cross country 
team, Annie Kelly. 
It took an immense amount of 
strength for David to leave all the things he had come to love and cher-ish during his time in college.
But if he wanted to be able to run 
comfortably and compete in what he loved, it seemed like he had no choice but to pack up and go home.
UF coach Paul Spangler had a 
plan to build David’s endurance and speed using an exhaustive training regimen.
“He’s an interesting phenom 
in a sense, where it’s very rare that an athlete doesn’t react well to al-titude,” Spangler said. “He brings leadership to the group, he’s an ex-
tremely hard worker, and no doubt 
that will rub off on this large fresh-man class.”
That leadership role is something 
David hopes to take a hold of. He’s working hard, trying to improve on the strides he made during his three years in Boulder.
The third-place finish last month 
was impressive, especially because David spent most of his time as a long-distance runner.
“From what I’ve been told, I do 
better at long distances,” Kilgore said. “I’d prefer an 8k or a 10k.”
Although he hasn’t run a 10k in 
his collegiate career, the endurance workouts Spangler has been putting 
Kilgore through have brought forth 
a confidence that may have been missing outside the sunny state of Florida.
“He’s a workhorse,” Spangler 
said. “He comes to practice every-day, and whenever someone comes from another program they’re kind of set in a system. And he’s really 
come in and embraced our system 
and really done a phenomenal job, and having Mark (Parrish), Jimmy (Clark) and Eddie (Garcia) be the same age as him and have similar ability has really benefitted him, so he comes to practice everyday and wants to work hard and gets in those workouts and competes with 
those guys.” 
�  �  �
On Saturday, David will compete 
on UF’s Mark Bostick Golf Course 
for the Mountain Dew Invitational, his first time racing in his home state since he left in 2010. It’s a relieving feeling to come home.
But he’s not regretting the past – 
just learning from it.
“If I had never left Florida, I 
would have always regretted not experiencing that,” Kilgore said. THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 18, 2014 § ALLIGATOR, 15

Starting is proof that a player is one of the best at that po-
sition. It’s what players work toward the entire time they’re on a team. 
But for Mackenzie Dagostino, it means learning the way 
her teammates play.
And so far, she’s doing all right.While Florida is 5-2 on the season, it’s not indicative of the 
talent on the team or the role Dagostino plays when setting up her teammates. 
It’s a testament of coach Mary Wise teaching her program 
how to work together against tough teams, specifically with their junior setter.
In just seven games, Dagostino has come into her own and led Florida in a solid start to the 2014 season.
So far she’s broken her career single-game assists record 
twice, has a total of 286 assists in seven games and is second 
in blocking with 16, behind 6-foot-4 fresh-
man middle blocker Rhamat Alhassan.
While Florida has two setters on its 
team, Wise has played Dagostino in every match so she can develop her setting and chemistry with her teammates, most spe-cifically, Alhassan.
With Alhassan’s height, Dagostino has 
had to learn to set the ball higher to help 
Alhassan hit the ball with her full power.
“It’s just practice. We’re doing so much better, if you look 
at the stats from this past weekend,” Dagostino said. “Rhamat 
hit crazy numbers, so it’s all in practice and all making sure that you consistently work on something in order to get it. It’s like any player, any setter, any hitter, any passer making sure they get that perfect pass, it’s just the repetition and the consistency that gets you to the achieving goal.”
With the development of Dagostino’s setting, UF saw 
success against No. 6 USC after two big losses to then-No. 7 Florida State on Sept. 4 and No. 2 Texas on Sept. 6.
And while two losses in the first seven games isn’t ideal 
for the Florida squad, Wise is happier with a 5-2 record than if the team boasted a 7-0 record so Florida can spot and cor-rect errors – something that was important in its win over USC.
“The good thing about losing is you really get to see what 
your weaknesses are,” Dagostino said. “And so she did a good job at like figuring those out to a tee and coming back here and working on exactly what we needed to work to make ourselves better from the loss. You can’t always think of a loss as a negative thing.”Improving setter assisting Florida as season progresses

the clout that Winston has, but nothing 
about public sentiment is going to get him to change and I think that’s pretty clear.
It requires taking something away from 
him that he loves — maybe more than once 
— to get through to somebody. 
You see, the interesting thing about 
Jameis Winston is he doesn’t have to answer 
to you or I or anyone really outside of his family and his team and because FSU has not properly taken an “enough is enough” stance. 
I believe they did yesterday. He con-
tinued like business as usual, since as far 
as he’s concerned, business was usual and 
yesterday was a tipping point. 
I’m aware he was suspended from the 
baseball team following crab-gate, I assume baseball is important to him, but it isn’t something that appears to be on schedule to pay him millions of dollars this time next year.
What Winston did on its face does not 
merit suspension, it merits a talking to from Jimbo Fisher, and maybe some windsprints after practice for what I regard as jockish be-havior. But combined with the other things he’s done — things that cannot be done flip-pantly when you are who he is — he forced FSU to act.
I don’t really think this suspension was 
initiated by Fisher. It’s got to go higher than 
that, and it’s evidenced pretty clearly by 
the fact that the statement released by the school was attached to athletics director Stan Wilcox and interim president Garnett Stokes.
Winston embarrassed them and made 
them look foolish while the school is in the midst of a highly contentious search for a new president and while the NFL contin-
ues to make an ass of itself seemingly every 
hour on the hour. 
The public relations climate a football 
player exists in nowadays along with Win-ston’s prior character demerits — both al-leged and proven — shows that what he did just wasn’t going to fly.
You can’t force Winston to change and 
he’s not dense enough to be oblivious to 
who he is.
I simply refuse to believe that.
I subscribe to the notion that he’s just 
apathetic, and if he continues to act out, the school will be forced to take extra measures to correct that because Winston’s attitude will leave them no choice.Saturday night, making the 6-foot-2 
receiver Driskel’s primary go-to pass catcher.
“He’s a guy that can get open 
and make people miss in space,” Driskel said. “That’s something that you want in a receiver. He’s going 
to have to continue to develop and 
make big plays, along with the rest of the receiving corps.”
Despite Robinson’s astonishing 
start to the 2014 campaign, offen-
sive coordinator Kurt Roper said 
there are always things to work on. 
His wife, Britt Roper, agrees.“You know I was coming home 
and my wife, she’s an old sports reporter so she knows something about football … and she goes, ‘Oh but his ball security,’” Roper said. 
“I said, ‘Well let’s just put him on 
the bench. You don’t want to play him. You want, we’ll put him on the bench. We won’t play him.’ She goes, ‘Wait a second. Hold on.’”
Joking aside, Roper knows the 
importance of diligent preparation when facing Nick Saban’s Crimson Tide. 
As Duke’s offensive coordinator 
in 2010, Roper was pitted against Alabama’s defense.
The Blue Devils scored only 13 
points compared to the Tide’s 62.
“We watched (the film), obvi-
ously, and I’ve watched it since then to try to learn anything from it,” Roper said. 
“But we felt like, for that season, 
that really hurt us for a couple of weeks, that a was tough to get over … That was a long day.”
