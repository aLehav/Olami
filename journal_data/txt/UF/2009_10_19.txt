ARKANSAS 20 0 UF 23
RAZOR- THIN WIN
117
Harrison Diamond/ Alligator Staff
UF kicker Caleb Sturgis watches his game-winning 27-yard field goal sail through the goalposts
with nine seconds remaining in Florida's 23-20 win over Arkansas on Saturday.0 FLORIDA AVOIDS UPSET
AFTER TRAILING FOR FIRST
TIME ALL SEASON.
By BOBBY CALLOVI
Alligator Staff Writer

As Arkansas' Greg Childs
sprinted past Florida cornerback
Janoris Jenkins on his way to a 75-
yard touchdown catch and run,
minds wandered back to last year's
Ole Miss game when Shay Hodge
scored on an 86-yard reception late
in the game.
Childs' score gave the Razor-
backs a 7-point lead in the fourth
quarter much like Hodge's did for
the Rebels.
The UF offense also looked simi-
lar to the one from a year ago, man-
aging to move the ball at times but
continuing to hurt itself with costly
fumbles -turning the ball over
four times this year and three times
against Ole Miss.
Again, the unit struggled on
third down.
This time it was 4 for 13 com-
pared to just 1 for 11 last year.It was also the first time No. 2
AP/No. 1 BCS UF (6-0, 4-0 South-
eastern Conference) failed to score
first in a game since the loss to Ole
Miss.
But when the Gators needed to
pick up a first down on their final
drive to win the game, the experi-
ence of last year's failure on fourth
and 1 may have played a crucial
role.
Facing third and 10 on Arkansas'
40-yard line, Tebow fired a pass to
Riley Cooper, who made the recep-
tion for a first down despite falling
on his route and having a defender
on top of him.
Cooper's catch allowed Florida
to keep the drive going and played
a big role in setting up Caleb Stur-
gis, who missed a 37-yarder on the
Gators' opening drive, to hit the
game-winning, 27-yard field goal to
defeat the Razorbacks 23-20.
"Third-and-10, the guy has
great coverage on Riley Cooper
and he just fights his way to make
the catch," Tebow said. "Does that
happen last year against Ole Miss?
I don't know; it would happen later

Growl attracts 35,000
By CAROLYN TILLO
Alligator Writer
Students and alumni may have sat on op-
posite sides of the field at Ben Hill Griffin Sta-
dium Friday night, but Gator Growl's skits
and performances brought the crowd of about
35,000 together.
Danny Wuerffel hosted the show, adding
skill as an entertainer to a resume already
complete with a Heisman trophy and minis-
try fighting poverty in New Orleans.
Wuerffel noted the age gap between stu-
dents and parents in the crowd and added
students may not know about former "Satur-
day Night Live" star Dana Carvey who, like
him, was big in the '90s.
A keyboard was brought out on stage, and
Wuerffel imitated Carvey's "Choppin' Broc-coli" skit with a mock rock star performance,
which turned into an introduction for Coach
Urban Meyer and quarterback Tim Tebow.
"Um, he is young and sexy and hot,"
Wuerffel sang. "The coach
from Florida State is old and
not."
Jessica James, a senior
psychology major, said
she was impressed with
Wuerffel's performance and
enjoyed the show more than
last year's Gator Growl.
Carve "Who knew Danny
Wuerffel had a sense of humor?" she said.
Meyer walked onto the stage and said it
felt great to be back home.

ESPN reporter discusses parents' push for athletics
By ALISON SCHWARTZ
Alligator Writer
Parents will do whatever it
takes to ensure their child makes
the team.
This includes seeking the
sperm of college athletes to geneti-
cally engineer their very own little
champion.
ESPN correspondent and UF
graduate Tom Farrey described
this desire to capture the traits of
athletic potential in a speech toabout 100 UF students and alum-
ni Friday afternoon at the Reitz
Union.
It's not just the $1 million pay-
check that leads parents to push
their children to become the next
Michael Jordan. Athletes tend to
get better grades at school and seek
higher education, Farrey said.
Farrey has three little champi-
ons of his own, so his observations
stem from investigative journal-
ism and firsthand experience, like
when he sits on the bleachers tocrosse.
"My goal with my kids is not to
get them a college scholarship," he
said. "My goal
is to have them
fall in love with
sports."
But youth
sports today are
in a completely
different ball-
park than they
were when Farrey grew up.
"[It] is incredibly organized
watch his daughter Anna play la- and incredibly intense," Farreysaid. "It's just changed dramati-
cally."
Today, making the team has
another important connotation. In
what Farrey described as an obe-
sity crisis, he dubbed youth sports
as a form of preventative medi-
cine.
Farrey said the number of over-
weight children has tripled since
1990.
"Giving kids fitness patterns
for life is a way to reduce the pub-
lic burden of health care costs later
on," Farrey said.This is not the only aspect of
youth sports that can be interpret-
ed as an investment. Financial elit-
ism has crept into the sports arena,
and Farrey said the children who
sometimes excel the most on the
field are the same children whose
parents can afford the $300 base-
ball bat.
Farrey has a game plan, and it's
about making sports accessible to
the public again.
"There needs to be a recommit-
ment," Farrey said. "Sports for all.
Play for life."
'Greeks' pledge for charity
0 UF WAS FIRST STOP OUTSIDE OF
CALIFORNIA FOR THE STARS.
BY GAIA BONINI
Alligator Contributing Writer
Nearly 500 people stood in line on the
first floor of the UF Bookstore to meet Scott
Michael Foster and Amber Stevens, stars of
the ABC Family show "Greek" Friday.
The co-stars, who play Cappie and Ash-
leigh, were in Gainesville through Home-
coming weekend to promote ABC Family's
Pledge Yourself to Do Something campaign,
which encourages students to volunteer for
organizations in their community.
The actors visit to UF marked the first
stop the campaign has made outside of Cal-
ifornia, where the series is filmed.
The series shows the lives of a group of
college students in fraternities and sorori-
ties at the fictitious Cyprus-Rhodes Univer-
sity.
"Our viewers are young," said Amy Ma-
loney, manager of media relations for ABC
Family."So we want to create a generation
of doers."
"Not a generation of don't-ers," Foster
added.The campaign supports all volunteer ef-
forts but endorses three national organiza-
tions in particular: Girls Inc., Global Green
USA and Cancer for College.
"We're all working together for the cam-
paign," Stevens said. "But each house on
the show has pledged one of the charities."
The signing lasted more than an hour
and a half, and Foster and Stevens smiled,
chatted and thanked each student who came
through the line for coming to the event.
Foster, wringing his hands after signing
more than 500 promotional fli-
Local ers and taking nearly as many
NewS pictures with fans, sat down
with his co-star and a fruit
plate to relax for a bit before being ushered
to their next campus stop: Gator Growl.
The pair had a weekend full of Home-
coming activities planned ending with a
flight home to Los Angeles, returning to an-
other 70-hour work week today.
"Our lives are really not so different
than any other kids," Foster said."We just
work instead of going to school, but we go
through all the same issues."
Stevens agreed.
"We may not be up all night studying for
the next physics final, but we're up all night
running lines," she said.Copyrighted Material

O.A.R. played 40-minute set after performances by Carvey, Jabbawockeez
GROW L, from page 1
The crowd cheered as Meyer
introduced each senior. Several
players offered words of thanks to
the fans, and Brandon Spikes even
sang a few lines of the Black Eyed
Peas' "I Gotta Feeling."
Meyer saved Tebow's intro-
duction for last. The giant screen
showed Tebow as his face broke
into a wide smile.
Tebow stepped onto the stage
to a standing ovation and hugged
Meyer.
"I'll be a Gator till the day I
die," he said as the crowd yelled
and cheered.
Videos featuring political fig-
ures and celebrities
On including Gov. Char-
Campus lie Crist and actor
Zach Braff were pep-
pered throughout the show. Dur-
ing each video, they told the audi-
ence to, "Let the Gator growl."
The show also had performanc-
es from Gainesville locals, includ-
ing singer Adam Clinch and UF
groups like Sabor Latino, a dance
group that combines salsa and hip
hop moves, the UF Gospel Choir
and the Dazzlers.
Decked out in a No. 15 jersey,
Dana Carvey took the stage and
a re-enacted Tebow's concussion.
Showing off his knack for imper-
sonations, he mimicked Tebow's
efforts at speech and Meyer's at-
tempts to have Tebow follow his
thumb.
Like Wuerffel, Carvey ad-dressed the division between stu-
dents and parents in the crowd,
referring to the drunk students on
one side of the stadium and the
parents on the other side, who paidfor the students' education.
Although he aimed jokes at
separate sections of the crowd and
noted the political and moral dif-
ferences between students andparents, he managed to keep ev-
eryone laughing.
Before he left the stage, Carvey
spouted out more than 20 celebrity
impressions, varying from Adam

Ben Hill Griffin Stadium at Florida Field on Friday night.Sandler to Bill Clinton.
Scott Michael Foster and Amber
Stevens, stars from ABC Family's
series "Greek," also had a spot in
the show. They announced Chris
Emmanuel as Homecoming king
and Kristen Gillis as Homecoming
queen.
Breaks between acts featured
commercials bashing Florida State
University and bemoaning UF's
drop to the No. 2 party school.
Even though the crowd started
trickling out at about 10 p.m., the
party continued until about 10:40
p.m. with performances by dance
troupe the Jabbawockeez and rock
band O.A.R., which wrapped up
the show.
The dance group moved fluidly
in white masks and black hats and
did a dance that blended Michael
Jackson moves with break dancing
and a remix of Beyonce's "Single
Ladies."
O.A.R. wrapped up the night
with a 40-minute performance for
the swaying crowd, with songs
including "Love and Memories"
and "That was a Crazy Game of
Poker."
Lead singer Marc Roberge
thanked the crowd and said it was
the loudest audience the band ever
had.
Roberge said he attended Gator
Growl about 15 years ago with his
brother who went to UF. After see-
ing the show, he dreamed of play-
ing there.
"To actually be here and be do-
ing it means a lot," Roberge said.

About 60,000 line University for Homecoming Parade
By MEG WAGNER and
ELIZABETH BEHRMAN
Alligator contributing writers
The human eye can see millions
of colors, but on University Avenue
Friday afternoon, the only two that
seemed to matter were orange and
blue.
About 60,000 onlookers came
out to observe the 86th annual
Homecoming Parade and dressed
almost exclusively in Gators garb as
they set up canopies, unfolded lawn
chairs and huddled on street curbs
to view the spectacle, forming a di-
chromatic sea on either side of the
avenue.
Before the parade, Gators fans
ran, walked, skipped and biked
their ways to the finish line for the
26th annual Gator Gallop, a two-
mile race down University Avenue
that kicks off the Homecoming Pa-
rade.
"Obviously people [who] live
here know it's a tradition," said
Chris Walker, director of Gator Gal-
lop. "Gainesville is a running city."The race started at the Percy
Beard Track on campus and con-
tinued down University Avenue to
Sixth Street and back around to Sec-
ond Street.
As runners raced down Universi-
ty, their parents and children waved
and clapped with the crowd.
"It helped having them cheer,"
said Jordann Sauls, a Santa Fe ju-
nior. She decided to run the race for
fun with her husband.
The race was split up into two
separate groups. Participants who
ran with children or dogs and those
who walked or rode bicycles began
the race at 11:15 a.m. Those who ran
and timed themselves started 15
minutes later.
Chris Trebilcock, one of this
year's winners, said it was the sec-
ond time he ran in Gator Gallop and
used it as an opportunity to have
fun and keep in shape.
"It's always good to come out
and run races," he said.
Other racers participated just for
fun and to support the Gators.
"It's gonna be fun being part ofthe parade," UF freshman Eleanor
McKenna said before the race.
The first male and female racers
in the second group to cross the fin-
ish line received a trophy. All of the
participants received Gator Gallop
T-shirts before the race.
Walker said he
was worried that
the early morn-
ing rain on Satur-
day would cause
some problems,
but the weather
cleared.
Nelson "I'm just really
happy," Walker
said. "Everything went according
to plan."
At noon, 18 police officers on
motorcycles revved their engines,
signaling the start of the parade. Be-
hind them came a caravan of police
vehicles with blue and red lights
flashing and sirens blaring.
The parade, which was orga-
nized by Florida Blue Key and con-
sisted of 136 units, is the largest of its
kind in the nation and was broad-cast to 300,000 television viewers,
according to a press release.
Parade participants, including
people on floats, riders and walkers,
made their way from the starting
point on Gale Lemerand Drive to the
final destination on the Bo Diddley
Community Plaza downtown. UF
and Santa Fe College clubs and or-
ganizations, in addition to local high
schools, businesses and community
groups, also participated.
UF's Fightin' Gator Marching
Band entertained the crowds with
favorite stadium tunes as the UF
cheerleaders chanted while sitting
on top of a fire truck.
The parade was also fea-
tured prominent figures from the
Gainesville community and Florida.
Grand marshal and 1996 Heisman
Trophy winner Danny Wuerffel,
Gainesville Mayor Pegeen Hanra-
han, Florida Chief Financial Officer
Alex Sink and UF Student Govern-
ment officers all sat in convertibles
and waved to the crowd.
Bill Nelson, a Florida senator,
rode down University Avenue in a1955 Ford Thunderbird.
Nelson, who attended UF be-
tween 1960 and 1962 before trans-
ferring to Yale University, still de-
scribes himself as a Gator at heart.
"The traditions have remained
the same," Nelson said, "but [UF]
has increased the quality of its facul-
ty and the quality of its education."
He also believes that the athletic
programs have strengthened over
the years.
"Back then, we could have never
dreamed of being a national cham-
pion in football or basketball," Nel-
son said.
Fans relaxed and enjoyed the
parade, unaware the Gators would
narrowly dodge a loss at the hands
of the Arkansas Razorbacks on Sat-
urday.
"No matter if we win or not, I'm
still really happy to be a part of [The
University of Florida]," said busi-
ness administration sophomore
Ashley Weisenfeld.

parade, visit the multimedia section of

Missing Machen
President should have
appeared at parade
Something was missing from Friday's Homecoming
Everyone you'd expect to see was in attendance,
including Gainesville Mayor Pegeen Hanrahan, Sen. Bill
Nelson and our beloved Albert.
Everyone except UF President Bernie Machen and
Gators quarterback Tim Tebow.
We can understand if Tebow was absent in prepara-
tion for Saturday's game -and to avoid a possible mob
of hormone-driven Gators alumni who don't get to see the
football star as often as we do.
But what about Machen?
If it's possible for the "legendary rock band" O.A.R. to
ride in two parade cars, then surely the president of the
university hosting the event could find the time to make
an appearance.
And being busy isn't an excuse -Nelson managed to
smile his way down University Avenue regardless of his
job in, you know, the U.S. Senate.
We're not disappointed that we didn't have the oppor-
tunity to offer UF's head honcho a t-shirt and copy of the
Alligator's Homecoming edition -though it was heart-
breaking that both McGruff the Crime Dog and a Taco Bell
hot sauce packet shot us down when we offered them cop-
ies.
But it doesn't reflect well upon the university when so
many state and local dignitaries can appear, and our own
president cannot.
Let the Greeks Growl
UF's Greek commu-nity raised the bar
on its self-impor-
tance at Gator Growl Fri-idea why Delta Upsilon's
Web site was changed to
WeRunNothing.com/tran-
nies. And we're not sure we
day night. want to.
Unfortunately, organiz- We realize many of
ers of the event failed to
check their numbers, which
would show that the Greek
community comprises less
than 20 percent of the Stu-
dent Body.
So when the Weekend
Update fake newscasters
dedicated their entire seg-
ment to inside jokes and
jabs concerning fraterni-
ties and sororities, they left
much of the audience in the
dark.
We don't know who the
Student Body president is
dating. We had to do some
research on why members
of AOPi smell (hint: potty
humor). We still have noGator Growl's leaders are
members of fraternities and
sororities. That's okay with
us. However, it doesn't
mean that the nation's larg-
est student-run pep rally
should turn into another
Greek social.
Newsflash: This ain't GI

Political gain halts health care reform
uture scholars will look back on the Great HealthcareDebate of 2009 and scratch their heads out of curi-
osity and confusion. Then they will ask two simple
questions: What took the greatest nation on earth so long
to finally make considerable progress in ensuring univer-
sal health care for its citizens? Why did Republicans and
even moderate Democrats oppose the idea?
Ever since President Franklin Roosevelt first declared
health care an "economic right" to be enjoyed by all Amer-
icans, there has been a steady stream of naysayers intent
on nixing health care reform. Charges of communism, so-
cialism and fascism are not new either. When President
Harry Truman tried to introduce a national health insur-
ance program in the late 1940s, the American Medical As-
sociation quickly attacked it as communist.
We've gone from anti-communism fears of the middle
20th century to anti-terrorism fears of today, but how has
public opinion changed since then? Not much, actually.
Multiple polls before and after the recent election show
a strong public desire for health care reform, reform that
would include government intervention in the insurance
industry.
Knowing this desire, I've been racking my brain to dis-
cover why so much hoopla has been made over the Great
Health Care Debate of 2009. Guess what? I solved the
question.
And if I don't get a Nobel award for this, a committee
in Norway can expect a very nasty letter next year.
Politics and politics only is the reason why some in this
country have met health care reform with such outrage.
Health care reform is the Democratic Party's ultimate pan-
acea, and the accepted thinking going around the table in
the Republican war room is to squash any and all reform
that's authored by anyone with a D by his or her name.
It's a shame that politics is overtaking this country's
best intentions once again. Health care reform was Teddy
Kennedy's professional cause of life, but he turned downPresident Richard Nixon's health
care insurance reform that would
have required all employers, large
or small, private or public, to offer
insurance to its employees. Ken-
nedy withdrew because of pressure
Matthew Christ from labor unions, just as Nixon
etters@alligator org backed down due to pressure from
the American Medical Association.
Issues and ideology may have con-
tributed to the lost negotiations between Nixon and Ken-
nedy, but the larger factor was an underlying mistrust be-
tween the two sides.
More than 60 years have passed since the idea of insur-
ing all Americans with some sort of health care coverage
has floated around the limestone walls of Washington,
D.C., and we are closer than ever to achieving this sought-
after goal. But mistrust between the political parties is
nearing its zenith and could threaten meaningful reform
once more.
This is why, in my infinite wisdom, I propose a no-po-
litical-gain ban on health care reform. The system desper-
ately needs reform, but fear of political exploitation could
ultimately doom any attempt and lead Democrats scram-
bling to come up with a watered-down bill just in time for
Christmas (surprise!).
The no-political-gain ban wouldn't allow any politi-
cian to campaign taking credit or discrediting any reform
bill that was passed this year. President Barack Obama
couldn't take credit for a bill in 2012, nor could any con-
gressional Democrats in 2010. This way, the Republican
leadership could stop trying to halt the Democrat electoral
gravy train with its one strategy of trying to trip Obama
and instead focus on legitimate ideas.
They could start by revisiting Nixon's shelved plan.

umn appears on Mondays.

Homecoming attendees show cruel side
I was excited to go to the Homecoming Parade.
I think of it as an excuse for all of Gainesville to
come out and celebrate, regardless of our differ-
ences. I thought it would be a nice occasion to take
my dog out. But, in doing so I was exposed to some
of the worst manners residents have to offer.
On numerous occasions, people simply pushed
my dog out of the way so they could shove past
us to get closer to University Avenue. One woman
standing more than 10 feet away from my leashed
dog and myself yelled at me to get away from her,
threatening to swat my dog with her umbrella.
I feel that my dog and I had every right to be
downtown, and while I did meet many kind peo-
ple and children who enjoyed his presence, I felt
that the actions presented by a few tremendously
rude people was enough to, if you excuse my pun,
rain on our parade. I took every step to ensure
my dog was not a danger or nuisance to anyone.
I hope that people realize that some of us consider
our pets part of our families; I would not push or
insult your children, don't do so to my dog.

Gator Growl disappoints alumnus
I am a Florida alumnus and have attended
Gator Growl for the past 11 years. This year I left
sorely disappointed. My first and foremost com-
plaint is that there were no fireworks. This is a tra-
dition that we look forward to every year. Not to
mention that the marching band didn't march, and
the cheerleaders didn't cheer.
There were hardly any student skits and only
one segment of the Gators "news." This year,
the sound system sounded great, but there were
hardly any skits to hear. The highlight was DannyWuerffel, who stole the show and was funnier than
the comedian. I hope next year is much better.

Online commenters show cowardice
Johnathan Lott is the vice chairman for the UF
College Republicans, my fraternity brother and
good friend. On Wednesday, he wrote a biting but
respectful response to the column bashing the "No
More Che Day Protest" my club hosted. I am glad
we got heated responses to our visibility stunt. We
hold these events so that people staunchly set in
their ways will have to at least consider their view-
points again to form a concise, respectful, educated
(and sometimes misguided) argument in return.
The key word in that last sentence was "re-
spectful." When I read the comments on Alligator.
org in response to Lott's column, I was appalled.
To quote the first comment: "In contrast, John Lott
is a stupid white child who joined the Republican
party, which is blatantly full of racist white trash."
This person posted under the guise "radical,"
and he or she is clearly an angry, misguided indi-
vidual. Not only is he or she a giant hypocrite, call-
ing Lott a racist and a "stupid white child" in the
same breath, but he or she is a coward. This person
hides behind an alias and posts whatever he or she
wants. You, sir, are pathetic. Lott has the courage
to put his name behind his thoughts, and so do I.
We can be found at any College Republicans meet-
ing, in person, and in room CSE 220 on every other
Thursday. Come stand up to us like a decent hu-
man being with a backbone or cower behind your
alias and stay on your high horse. I already know
what you will choose to do. I feel sorry for you.

Guest column
Balloon hoax family
deserves no attention
ou probably heard aboutthe "balloon boy" and his
family. You know, the
6-year-old who was thought to be
soaring over Denver last week in a
giant helium balloon invented by
his father. It turned out he never
was in the balloon. In fact, he was
safe at home the entire time.
Authorities in Colorado are
already calling the now-notori-
ous Balloon Boy incident a hoax.
It's not really surprising coming
from a family that previously ap-
peared on the reality TV show
"Wife Swap." Authorities are also
planning to press charges against
the family for the balloon chase,
which cost thousands of govern-
ment dollars and other resources.
Sheriff Jim Alderden of Larimer
County told CNN that the boy's
family intended to use the pub-
licity of the incident in hopes of
"better marketing themselves for
a reality television show at some
point in the future."
My biggest fear? The family's
plan is working.Wade Powell If the
Speak king Out media don't
let go of the
balloon sto-
ry immediately, the family's pun-
ishment is going to be reversed
when it is actually given a reality
show. That hurts me inside.
After tricking the public, cre-
ating a false sense of danger and
leading police on a wild and
costly goose chase, this family is
anything but deserving of fame or
recognition.
At the current rate of public-
ity, it won't be long before the
family has a TV show of its own.
Who knows, there could even be
a balloon boy movie. The profits
will counter the family's financial
woes, and the family will have
gotten what it wanted: an extend-
ed national spotlight.
So please, for my sake and the
sake of intellectual America, ev-
eryone forget about the balloon
boy before it's too late.

student.

I w '11% 1~No moral victory for underdog Hogs
Harrison Diamond/ Alligator Staff
Arkansas tailback Dennis Johnson breaks away on a run dur-
ing the Gators' 23-20 win over the Razorbacks on Saturday.0 ARKANSAS COULDN'T TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF UF MISTAKES.
By KYLE MAISTRI
Alligator Staff Writer
kmaistri@alligator org
With 3:08 left in the game, Arkan-
sas expected to win.
It didn't matter that Florida was
the No. 1 ranked team in the nation,
or that the Razorbacks were un-
ranked and 1-2 in conference play.
Arkansas kicker Alex Tejada
trotted onto the field to attempt a
38-yard, go-ahead field goal with
the game tied at 20, but the junior
hooked the try wide left, leaving
plenty of time on the clock for UF to
go down the field and score.
Quarterback Tim Tebow led the
final drive, and sophomore Caleb St-
urgis knocked in the game-winning
field goal with nine second remain-
ing, spoiling the Razorbacks upset
bid on UF's homecoming.
"That one hurts right there, we
beat ourselves," Arkansas quarter-
back Ryan Mallett said. "They're a
great team, but we beat ourselves."
After falling behind 20-13 with
just under 10 minutes remaining,
Florida took only 2:13 to tie the gameup.
Running back Jeff Demps ran
the ball three times for 32 yards on
that drive including the game-tying
10-yard scamper, and the Razor-
backs helped the Gators by commit-
ting back-to-back penalties, costing
themselves 25-yards.
The first came on a pass-inter-
ference call on cornerback Ramon
Broadway when he didn't turn to
look for the ball on a deep throw
from Tebow to wide receiver Deonte
Thompson in the end zone.
The very next play, senior de-
fensive tackle Malcolm Sheppard
picked up a personal foul after Ar-
kansas successfully sniffed out a
screen pass that would have went
for only 1 yard.
"I didn't like them, I didn't think
they were good calls," Arkansas
coach Bobby Petrino said.
The Razorbacks moved the ball
easily and into field-goal position on
their next drive before Tejada missed
his second field goal of the game -
the first coming from 40 yards out in
the third quarter.
Arkansas offensive coordina-
tor Paul Petrino, brother of Bobby,
thought his unit executed the game
plan well against the No. 1 defensein the nation, especially on the
ground.
Sophomore Dennis Johnson
rushed for 107 yards on 14 carries,
breaking tackles and gashing Florida
for gains of 42, 25 and 18 yards. He
added one catch for 15 yards to go
with 124 yards on kickoff returns.
"That's a game we should have
won, we had it," Paul Petrino said.
"It's hard to take, we should've
won."
Wide receiver Greg Childs said
the team certainly felt it was on the
way to a stunning upset after his 75-
yard touchdown catch in the fourth
quarter.
The sophomore ran by UF cor-
nerback Janoris Jenkins on third and
17 and caught a perfectly thrown
ball from Mallett before safety Ah-
mad Black could provide help in the
Gators' cover-2 defensive scheme.
With less than two minutes re-
maining in the first half, Childs ran
by Jenkins in man coverage and
caught a 46-yard pass to set up a
field goal.
"Our players were very con-
vinced that we could come out there
and win the game," Bobby Petrino
said. "I didn't feel like we had to do
anything extraordinary to win."
Arkansas game reminiscent of Ole Miss
Just like last year, the Gators struggled with an
underdog from the Southeastern Conference
West at home.
Just like last year, they fumbled all over the
place, gave up big plays and showed a general
lack of focus.
Just like last year, they got a rude wake-up
call.
Only this time, when the alarm sounded, they
didn't hit snooze.
Sure, they fumbled the alarm clock trying
to turn it off, stumbled around on the floor for
a while and knocked some stuff over getting to
their feet, but Florida prevailed, 23-20, and is still
undefeated.
All in all, I think it's a positive that the Gators
could play as poorly as they did and still win,
and there's no way they come out and wet the
bed like that again this year. Right?
"Just like the Ole Miss game was a wake-up
call (in 2008), I think this was the same kind of
wake-up call," linebacker Ryan Stamper said.
"But luckily we came out with the victory instead
of a loss. This lets the team know that if we don't
come out to play in all phases, we can easily lose
a game. We have to stop giving up big plays on
defense and have no turnovers on offense."Mike McCall
McCall-in' It
Like I See It
mmccall@alligator orgThe difference between
the Ole Miss loss and the
Arkansas win boils down
to one thing: trusting your
kicker.
In 2008, Urban Meyer
didn't seem to believe in
Jonathan Phillips. On UF's
first drive, he passed up a
47-yard field goal attempt
for a failed conversion try
on 4th-and-3.
On the last drive, he took his chances and lost
on 4th-and-i rather than let Phillips try a go-
ahead 49-yarder.
The second decision was the right call, and
maybe the first was too.
But either way, Meyer didn't go down that
path again.
Even after Caleb Sturgis missed from 37, Mey-
er trotted him out for kicks of 30, 51 and 27 yards,
the last of which won the game with nine seconds
to play.
The end of the Gators' last drive was spent lin-

weekend matches

After the Gators were swept
in a regular-season conference
match for the first time under
coach Mary Wise, nobody knew
how they would respond.
But No. 9 Florida (14-3,
8-2 Southeastern Conference)
capped off a two-win weekend
with a dominant performance
against Georgia (11-9, 2-7 SEC),
answering that question.
The Gators dismantled the
Bulldogs on Sunday in Athens,
Ga., 3-0 (25-22, 25-16, 25-11).
Whether they were attacking
or defending, the Bulldogs couldnot keep up. UF had no problem
finding holes in the defense as
it put up a hitting percentage of
.368 for the match, while hold-
ing Georgia to a .087 hitting effi-
ciency. The Gators also won the
blocking battle 11.5-2 and dug
up 11 more balls.
"We played this entire match
at the right intensity level and
the right effort level," Wise said.
"There were very few easy kills
for Georgia and I thought the of-
fense and the defense were at a
very high level today."
In the first set Georgia was
able to keep it close and finish
with a .448 hitting efficiency, but

Today's question: What was UF's
worst loss since Tim Tebow took over
as the team's starting quarterback?TEEING OFF WITH PHIL KEGLER
U Redskins front-office officials told coach Jim Zorn he was being stripped of
playcalling duties. His genius was apparently too much, as Washington is aver-
aging 13.2 points per game. .About three years ago, it was Matt Bryant Day in
Tampa after he made a 62-yd game-winning FG. Now, he's kicking for the UFL's
Florida Tuskers while the Bucs are 2 for 7 on field goals. Great management.a *
'Bama jumps UF in AP poll
FOOTBALL, from page 1
in the year though.
"I just think we learned that
earlier, and at the end of the
game, we were doing everything
we could to win that game."
After the Ole Miss loss, Tebow
gave "The Promise" and led the
Gators to a BCS National Cham-
pionship Game win.
This time, he didn't wait un-
til after the game to motivate his
team.
His speech came in the locker
room at halftime.
"Tebow came up and gave a
speech, it's good to see us bounce
back in the second half like we
did, but at the same time it's a
gut check and a reality check for
us," wide receiver David Nelson
said "We can't ever prepare like
we did this week.
"From now on we're going
to remember this game and ride
this feeling for the rest of the sea-
son."
Tebow's speech after the Ole
Miss game played a big part in
changing the team's mindset.
Offensive tackle Carl Johnson
said last year the team was over-
confident and thought it could
just show up and win, but this
time, the Gators had a different
attitude.
"The team wouldn't lose; our
captains wouldn't let us lose; our
coaches wouldn't let us lose,"
Johnson said. "Even if it took
going to overtime six times, we
weren't going to lose."
Although UF came away with
a win, it knows how close the
game was to finishing even more
like last year.
The four lost fumbles, the low
third-down conversion rate, the
six sacks allowed and the missed
chances in the red zone usually
result in a loss.
"One of these days, and I am
glad it wasn't today, these turn-
overs and not executing could
hurt us," Tebow said. "ThankGod, it wasn't today."
The close game did hurt the
Gators in the AP ranking, as they
lost their No. 1 ranking to Ala-
bama.
This week marked the first
BCS poll of the season, however,
and it was there that UF retained
the No. 1 spot that matters.
"One of these days, and
I am glad it wasn't to-
day, these turnovers and
not executing could hurt
us. Thank God, it wasn't
today."
Tim Tebow
UF senior quarterback
Even with the win, the Gators'
offense still did not look domi-
nant, although the passing game
showed flashes that could help
them later.
For most of the game, Florida
relied on its defense, which was
suffocating early but struggled
down the stretch and ended up
allowing 357 yards of total of-
fense.
Tebow was able to connect
with a wide receiver for a big
play, finding an uncovered Deon-
te Thompson for a 77-yard score.
The pass gave Tebow the SEC re-
cord for total touchdowns (123 -
75 passing and 48 rushing) as he
surpassed former Gator Danny
Wuerffel.
And Cooper's late game per-
formance resembled that of a go-
to receiver, which is something
the Gators have lacked all sea-
son.
Cooper finished the game with
six catches for 58 yards, but he
had only three for 28 yards until
the final drive.
Florida avoided the Ole Miss-
like upset this time, but it will
need to continue to establish a
passing game and improve in the
red zone if the Gators are going
to finish the year unbeaten.

MCCALL, from page 14_
to kick off.
After the roar of the crowd fad-
ed away, the message remained
loud and clear that Florida isn't
invincible.
That was backed up Sunday,
when UF dropped to No. 2 behind
Alabama in the AP poll.
For all the talk of the Gators
struggling, this was the first game
they should have lost. Unlike Ten-
nessee, Kentucky and LSU, Ar-
kansas could muster a score when
needed.
That feeling that Florida wouldinevitably pull it out was nowhere
to be found for much of the game,
and UF walked away with much
more than what was deserved.
If this was just a wake-up call
and not a sign of things to come,
the Gators got their one bad game
out of their system without taking
a loss.
The rest of the season is about
getting in tip-top shape to face the
Crimson Tide for the SEC crown
without losing twice beforehand,
but if Florida doesn't spring out
of bed and slap Mississippi State
silly next weekend, it may be time
to put those Pasadena travel plans
on hold.Murphy tallies season's fifth triple-double
VOLLEY, from page 14
UF clamped down in the second and third sets as
it blocked a combined nine balls. Georgia could
only manage an efficiency of zero and -.114 in
those respective sets.
"Good things happen when we block balls,"
Wise said. "We've worked so hard all season
long on blocking and our players have really
bought into that."
Junior setter Brynja Rodgers finished with a
team-high 24 assists and has started to look a lot
more comfortable in the offense after transfer-
ring from New Mexico State in the offseason.
"I thought it was as good a setting perfor-
mance that she has had," Wise said. "All of
Brynja's hitters had such great looks and it's fun
watching her learn to set those hitters."
One of the players who benefited from Bryn-
ja's performance was sophomore setter Kelly
Murphy. She just missed a triple-double Sundaywith 15 kills, 16 assists and 7 digs.
But she did not fall short Friday as she racked
up her fifth triple-double of the season in a three-
set win against Auburn (12-8, 4-5 SEC). She
racked up 11 kills, 19 assists and 12 digs as the
Gators handed the Tigers a loss 3-0 (25-19, 25-22,
25-21).
After only starting one match so far this sea-
son, sophomore opposite hitter Callie Rivers
gave UF a lift over the weekend. She started both
of the matches and tallied up a season-high ten
kills and only one error Friday. On Sunday, Riv-
ers finished the match with five block assists.
"The key is that she is scoring points for us,"
Wise said. "If we can get three points per game
out of Callie -that would be huge for us. She
doesn't have to lead us in kills."
With these two wins the Gators finished what
Wise called the toughest stretch of the season
with a 4-2 record.
