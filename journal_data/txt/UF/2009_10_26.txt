Tebow struggles in Gators victory
By MIKE DIFERDINANDO
Alligator Staff Writer

STARKVILLE, Miss. -Tim
Tebow has made a career out of
playing hero for the Gators. But
Saturday night, it was the Heis-
man Trophy winner who needed
saving.
Tebow was 12-of-22 passing
for 127 yards and two intercep-
tions in No. 1 Florida's 29-19 win
over Mississippi State (3-5, 1-3
Southeastern Conference).
"Tim's not trying to be
a hero. But we might
be asking him to do too
much."
Urban Meyer
UF football coach
"I did not coach well tonight,"
UF coach Urban Meyer said. "I
put Tim in some tough situations
down in the red zone. Our red-
zone offense right now is really
an issue."
UT (7-0, 5-0 SEC) rallied be-
hind a defense that held MSU to
237 total yards and didn't allow
an offensive touchdown.
Tebow, who had two intercep-
tions returned for touchdowns,
declined to talk to the media fol-
lowing the Gators' first win in
Starkvillle since 1985.
It was the first time in his ca-
reer that Tebow has been healthy
and chose not to speak after a
game.Harrison Diamond / Alligator Staff
UF quarterback Tim Tebow is hit as he throws his second interception during the Gators' 29-19 win
against Mississippi State in Davis Wade Stadium in Starkville, Miss., on Saturday.
The quarterback carried the
ball 22 times for 88 yards, includ-
ing a 26-yard touchdown run that
tied him with Georgia's Herschel
Walker on the SEC's all-time rush-
ing touchdown list (49).
"Tim's not trying to be a hero,"Meyer said. "But we might be
asking him to do too much."
Tebow has already carried
the ball 121 times this season. He
rushed 210 times when he won
the Heisman Trophy as a sopho-
more in 2007.The mistakes that could be
rationalized against LSU and Ar-
kansas turned into legitimate con-
cerns against Mississippi State.

2 Alachua residents die in plane crash near Tampa
Three people were killed Friday
when a plane crashed near Zephyrhills.
Pilot Thomas Long, 44, and Alachua
residents Tina Copeland, 46, and her
daughter Cami, 7, were the only pas-
sengers, according to a Pasco County
Sheriff's Office press release.
They left Gainesville in a single-
engine plane and were about 20 miles
north of their destination in Lakeland
when Long said they had an emergen-cy, said Federal Aviation Administra-
tion spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen.
Air traffic control directed the plane
to the nearest airport in Zephyrhills but
lost contact with the pilot with three
miles to go, Bergen said. The wreckage
was found three-quarters of a mile from
the airport. The National Transporta-
tion Safety Board and the FAA are in-
vestigating the cause of the crash.

IMMOKALEE WORKERS
By MORGAN WATKINS
Alligator Contributing Writer
Silvia Perez has worked in
the fields picking tomatoes for
17 years.
Perez, 35, usually wakes
up at 4 a.m. to look for work
because she does not have a
steady job. Every day is a new
search for a new employer,
she said.
To make $50 a day, she
must pick 2 1/2 tons of toma-
toes. Because the same field
can be harvested up to four
times, she may reach that
quota during the field's first
harvest but only scrounge up
enough tomatoes during the
fourth harvest to earn $20 for
the day's work.
Perez is one of about 30
members of the Coalition of
Immokalee Workers, a com-
munity-based organization
of Latino, Mayan Indian and
Haitian immigrants employed
in low-wage jobs throughout
Florida.

One Less Car Day promotes
alternative transportation
Bryanna Hahn has had a bike
for 20 years and never fixed a
flat tire until Friday.
The criminology graduate
student had her chance on Fri-
day during the Fix a Flat Chal-
lenge at the second annual One
Less Car Day, which was spon-
sored by UF's Office of Sustain-
ability.
The celebration promoted the
use of alternative transportation
and asked people to sign up for
the One Less Car Challenge.
The challenge is an online
program in which participants
log their miles using alternative
transportation and earn points,
which can lead to individual or
team prizes at the end of the se-
mester, said Andrea Grossman,
an environmental science junior
and intern at the Office of Sus-
tainability.
The event went from 11 a.m.
to 1 p.m. on the Reitz Union
North Lawn.
Passers-by were invited to
go on a scavenger hunt, learn
about alternative transportation
and fix a flat tire.
About 950 students, faculty
and staff have already joined
the challenge.
The goal is to have 2,000 peo-
ple signed up by its end, said
Anna Prizzia, director of the Of-
fice of Sustainability.

Thousands expected at Friends of the Library sale
* THE BOOK SALE LASTS
THROUGH WEDNESDAY.
ByCJ PRUNER
Alligator Writer
Surrounded by buildings
much taller and more pleasing to
the eye, the warehouse at 430-B N
Main St. is easily overlooked.
But this weekend, the ware-
house transformed into the set-
ting for a Gainesville tradition
-the biannual Friends of the
Library book sale, which kicked
off Saturday.
The sale, which offers deals on
donated books, as well as videos,
records, magazines
Local and other literary
News treasures, has been
going on for more
than 50 years. Proceeds benefit
local libraries.
"This is for the people who
love bargains and for people who
love books," said Liz Jones, book
sale volunteer chairwoman.
About 300 volunteers work
year-round to prepare for first
the spring sale and then the fall
sale.
"We go six months non-stop to
make sure this [event] happens,"
she said. "We take two weeks to
say, 'Whew.' Then we're back at
it again."Although she admits that the
process can be challenging and
taxing, Jones said that the end re-
sult is worth the work.
"I saw a small child who was
so excited to find a first edition
of 'Gulliver's Travels,"' she said."That made me happy."
For those with a few minutes
and a pocketful of change, most
prices were in the bargain range.
But for book connoisseurs
which a rich taste, the back sec-
tion housed finely printed, leath-er-bound editions.
The rest of the books, which
were crammed into towering
shelves and narrow cubbies, are
organized into subjects ranging
from classic literature to cook-
ing.
Juliana Jimenez/ Alligator Staff
Kim Withers and Suzanne Waters, a teacher at the Cornerstone Academy, look for books for their daugh-
ters at the Friends of the Library Fall book sale on Saturday.Most books will be marked
down to half of their listed retail
value on Tuesday and to 10 cents
Wednesday, the final day of the
sale.
But not everyone is holding
out for the best deals.
More than 1,400 people ar-
rived within the first half hour,
and 5,000 to 6,000 people are ex-
pected to attend throughout the
week, according to book sale vol-
unteers.
As the warehouse hummed
with excitement, attendees pil-
laged the towering piles of lit-
erature, grabbing hold of all the
Dickens and Dostoevsky that
their wicker baskets, laundry
hampers or, for those who came
unprepared, their hands could
hold.
Radha Zanzal, a student at
Santa Fe High School, seemed
to be losing the battle with the
weight of the bargains as her jag-
ged collection of fantasy novels
and Disney cassettes swayed back
and forth, threatening to fall.
Zanzal has come to the sale for
the past two years and describes
herself as an avid reader.
She believes the sale is an
untapped treasure and plans to
come back before it ends.
"I brought around $40, and I
just might use it all," she said. "I
can't wait for Wendesday."

Breast-shaped cupcakes raise cancer awareness
0 THEY RAISED $200.
By ANDREW WYZAN
Alligator Contributing Writer
The phrase "Save second
base!" could be heard throughout
Turlington Plaza Friday whenone of UF's Relay for Life teams
raised breast cancer awareness
and served cupcakes resembling
breasts.
"It's a funny idea to balance
a serious disease," said Jacki
Klutcharch, a public relations
senior and the event's co-chair-
woman for the team.The team spent about $39 on
cupcakes and additional items
for Friday's event.
They bought
On 100 cupcakes from
Campus Publix, along with
frosting and assort-
ed additions like sprinkles and
chocolate chips."This is the second year we've
done this," Klutcharch said.
"I'm not sure how it started
but it's great for marketing pur-
poses."
The cupcakes were not sold
for profit, but the team did accept
donations.
"Our purpose right now is notto raise money," Klutcharch said.
"It's to raise awareness."
However, they raised about
$200 in donations. They raised
about $89 at a similar event they
held Monday.
A breast cancer survivor was also
in attendance at Friday's event. See
alligator.orgfor her interview.

fair food nation!" The demonstra-
tion's purpose was to place pres-
sure against the Aramark Corp.
and Publix Super Markets to pay
a penny more per pound of toma-
toes, as well as to guarantee more
dignified working conditions for
tomato pickers.
Protesters marched from the
Plaza of the Americas to the Reitz
Union, where several speakers, in-
cluding Dave Schneider, a member
of Students for a Democratic Soci-
ety, spoke to the crowd about the
campaign.
"This is a struggle that involves
all of us," Schneider said during his
speech. "The fact that we can walk
into the Reitz and buy a sandwich
that has a tomato on it that more
than likely came from Immoka-
lee -we have a connection right
there."
Marchers then made their way
to Gator Corner Dining Center,
where they stood at the front of thebuilding calling for justice for the
Immokalee workers.
About 30 protesters continued
the trek to the Publix Super Market
on the corner of West University
Avenue and Southwest 34th Street,
while others drove and rejoined
them.
About 100 people marched on
the sidewalk in front of the store,
calling for Publix to listen to their
demands.
Dwaine Stevens, a spokesman
from Publix's division in Jackson-
ville, Fla., said the company buys
tomatoes at a fair market price and
will continue to dobusinessbecause
they do not set tomato prices.
A delegation of about seven pro-
testers met with Publix officials at
the site to give them letters written
to the manager and several pages
of signatures from supporters of
the cause.
Stevens said he respected their
right to protest and would take the
documents to Publix's corporate of-
fices.Ana uoni-Lessan / Aiigazor biani

Take A Hike
Prepaid won't help those
who need it most
ast week, registration began for parents who want to pur-
chase Florida prepaid college plans for their children.
On its Web site, the organization tried to cover a mas-
sive jump in its prices by saying, "You can't afford to wait any
longer to lock in today's plan prices."
But for many Florida families, it's true: They can't afford it.
In June, UF's Board of Trustees approved to raise tuition
each year until it reaches the national average -about $7,000 a
year, compared to Florida's $4,000.
UF can increase its tuition by up to 15 percent each year until
it reaches the national average.
This is called differential tuition.
According to USF's Web site, differential tuition is an extra
fee that gives Florida's research universities -UF, FSU, USF,
Fill and UCF -money to continue offering competitive aca-
demic programs.
It's not tuition in the traditional sense, as it doesn't directly
fund the classes you're taking each semester like a scholarship
would.
Bright Futures does not cover it.
To cover the differential tuition fees, Florida prepaid offers
an "optional plan." This year, the price of the "optional plan"
soared from $4,600 to $20,000 for an infant that will hopefully
go to college in 18 years.
However, paying differential tuition is not optional.
According to an article in the Sun-Sentinel, "Florida Prepaid
officials estimate that within eight or nine years, students and
parents will pay more in differential tuition than they do in
state-set tuition."
This is because universities can increase differential tuition
every year until their tuitions match the national average, which
is also increasing.
We understand why Florida prepaid raised the cost of its op-
tional plan, but we cannot see how a 300 percent increase is fair
to low- and middle-income families. Their children need and
would benefit from prepaid the most.
The sudden price hike will deter people from buying the op-
tional plan, which seems like it covers the worst-case scenario in
this tuition hike-a-thon.
But what if tuition does not go up by the maximum projected
amount that prepaid is charging? And what if universities don't
increase tuition to meet the national average by the time Ma and
Pa's future academian heads to college?
We did some math (yes, we have been known to do that on
occasion), and the numbers do work out if the worst-case sce-
nario comes true. But we disagree with Florida Prepaid's deci-
sion to increase the cost of the optional plan all at once.
By forcing new participants to essentially foot the whole hy-
pothetical bill of tuition 18 years down the road, it makes the
program basically pointless.
They end up paying the entire cost of sending their children
to college, instead of locking in the current -and lower -tu-
ition rate.
Florida Prepaid was created to save people money. Now all
it does is allow people to spread out the payments over a longer
period of time instead of paying it right when tuition is due.
However, we're willing to bet that people who are planning
for their children's college 18 years in advance are also capable
of saving that money over the same time period.
The increase in cost reverses the original intent of the pre-
paid program. It is supposed to allow lower income families the
opportunity to send their children to college by paying lower
tuition costs. Instead, it forces participants to pay the higher tu-
ition expected in the future. It doesn't save them any money.
Instead of making college more affordable, this just puts it
further out of reach.

Obarma should get his hands dirty
f Dick Cheney didn't earn the title "Darth" that NewYork Times columnist Maureen Dowd bestowed upon
him when in office, he's certainly earned it throughout
his personal life. His raspy, shallow voice that pines to whis-
per, "Luke, I am you father" is quick to criticize the current
administration.
The latest criticism, that the White House is "dithering
while America's armed forces are in danger" as they draft
a new Afghanistan strategy, has been met with strong re-
buke from both the White House and democratic strate-
gists. Cheney, after all, isn't the most popular figure in the
Republican Party, and he can be easily used as a rallying call
for Democrats still rightfully angered by the mess Bush and
Darth left for President Obama to "mop up."
Afghanistan is one of those messes. A farrago of both ne-
cessity and psychological comfort in the immediate months
following Sept. 11, the war in Afghanistan served Obama
valiantly during the campaign, allowing the Democratic can-
didate to play both the dove and hawk, as he supported a full
withdrawal from Iraq and a re-examination of the Afghani-
stan war front.
His decision on Iraq has been well-recorded and well-
received with the American public. But what about Afghani-
stan?
The Afghanistan War, as I've mentioned before, has been
called the war of necessity -a war that was reactive, rather
than preemptive. As I've also mentioned before, publicly, it
seems that Obama has two options: Either adopt Gen. Stanley
McChrystal's recommendation of sending 40,000 additional
troops to the region, or adopt Vice President Joe Biden's plan
of withdrawing the majority of troops and applying elite
teams of special forces to root out the al-Qaida holdouts in
Afghanistan and Pakistan.
There are strong cases to be made for both options. There
is also a strong case to be made of a third option, a middleway that straddles both McChrystal's
and Biden's approaches by sending in
20,000 troops with embedded special
forces to the region.
_ooe now believe the president
favors this third way. Politically, he
Matthew Christ shields himself from Republicans
Ietters@alligator org antsy to have a reason to label him as
weak on national security, and he lets
true liberals sleep easy knowing their president saved 20,000
troops from deployment.
Going for the third option, seeking the middle way,
and refusing to get his hands dirty, is becoming a hallmark
of Obama's presidency. Try as some conservatives may,
Obama's policies aren't that radical.
Issue ownership is another problem the White House
must confront. Just as his popularity has shown the first hints
of slipping below the 50-point mark, many pundits have
speculated that Obama's lack of definitiveness is to blame.
Likewise, 43's arrogant certitude and Cheney's diabolical
smirk may have hurt the popularity of the last West Wing oc-
cupants. It seems the nuance and consideration that goes into
each decision coming from the Obama White House could
very well keep driving public approval lower.
The American people respect definitiveness, but have
little patience for nuanced policymaking, if only because we
don't understand it. What's more, definitiveness, and "own-
ing" of a war, is required. The president isn't reveling in in-
decisiveness, as Darth is too eager to point out, but is instead
straddling the fence, trying to shape his image as a peace-
maker while waging war.
Mr. President, it's time to put away the mop and get your
hands dirty.

Letters to the Editor
UF should address asbestos in dorms
There is asbestos in nearly every dorm
on this campus. I live in Tolbert Hall, and
we had exposed asbestos in our trash room
at one time.
Asbestos doesn't just cause health
problems. It causes Mesothelioma, a form
of lung cancer.
People moving into residence halls
should really know about the horrible and
dangerous conditions within, as the only
asbestos notification in all of Tolbert Hall
is an 8-by-11-inch sheet of paper posted in
the laundry room.
I'm sure if parents knew what they were
paying exorbitant rent for their children to
live in, they would rather pay less for off-
campus housing.
In Tolbert Hall, gallons upon gallons of
water are wasted daily due to the nearly
60-year-old faucets that have yet to be
fixed or replaced and when students and
the long waits for hot water.
The water temperature is also wildlyerratic.
Shower Coaches are a A

wants to coach me on my

In response to Friday's a
ing shower times with Sho
claim that they are both a
wasteful service for UF.
Privacy is something I dof anymore, and what's better than an
aste of money LCD screen staring at me when I'm trying
oblems. to relax from the day's events?
watering side- I agree that sustainability is an impor-
oung saplings tant issue that needs to be addressed and
brain, UF: You that many students are wasteful with wa-
of your dorm ter habits.
Yet, why should the university spend
Matthew Gilton more than $5,000 to install Shower Coach-
UF student es in all on-campus showers?
I would rather have my tuition dollars
go to a better cause, such as renovating the
Reitz Union.
ve, wasteful Showering offers me not only privacy,
ntored enough but also a means to de-stress myself from
nt of Housing the chaos as a student.
asteful show- It is one of the only times I can reflect
I day at meet- and think alone without worrying about
my schedule. I did not apply to UF to feel
rticle on limit- like I am in ROTC with restrictions on my
wer Coaches, I personal habits.
distasteful and In the time-sensitive world that I am a
part of, why do I need another gadget dic-
on't get much tating the schedule of my life? Showeringshould not be a competition to see who can
set a Guinness World Record.
I might as well drop the Art of Shower-
ing for failing inspection with my 15-min-
ute showers.
When else can I step back from my
busy schedule and forget about the time?
Instead of always being so time-conscious,
I feel that we should live like we're dying,
because sustainability does not merit a
spot on my bucket list.
If Shower Coaches are coming to
UF next year, I will be a firm proponent
against the system. I neither need a univer-
sity-sanctioned timer watching my every
move, nor do I want to feel less productive
at my inability to shower as quickly as my
footprint-conscious peers.
Next time I turn on the lights in the
bathroom, if I see a Shower Coach on the
wall, I will introduce it to a new friend -
the trash can.

Guest column
Students should demand better wages for Immokalee workers
Students are often insulated from a lot of issues outsideof Gainesville. Tomorrow at 7:30 p.m., you have an
opportunity to affect the lives of a tremendous num-
ber of farm workers.
During the off-season, about 90 percent of tomatoes
bought in the U.S. come from Florida, particularly the
fields in a town called Immokalee. Among the companies
that get tomatoes from Florida is our monopolistic campus
food service provider, Aramark Corp.
Tomato pickers in Immokalee are subjected to labor con-
ditions on par with many third-world countries. Over the
course of a 12-hour work day, an Immokalee farm worker
has to pick between 2 and 2 1/2 tons of tomatoes to make
Florida minimum wage.
Worst of all, since 1997 there have been seven convictedDave Schneider cases of slavery involving more than
Speaking Out 1,000 Immokalee farm workers, the
most recent of which happened less
than a year ago.
This past Saturday, I was joined by more than 130 stu-
dents, faculty, activists and Immokalee farm workers in
demanding that Aramark negotiate with their represen-
tative organization, the Coalition of Immokalee Workers.
Right now, Subway, McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell
and several other corporations have agreed to directly pay
a penny more per pound of tomatoes picked to the farm
workers. The coalition is calling on Aramark to do the same
thing.
Because every dining option on campus is owned by Ar-
amark, any student who has eaten on campus has a moralimperative to assist the coalition in its struggle for justice in
Immokalee. Student Senate heard a resolution in support
of the CIW last month that a majority of Senators from all
three parties voted for. In a bizarre turn of events, the reso-
lution didn't pass because it needed a two-thirds majority.
This Tuesday, Senate is hearing the same resolution
again. Based on the enormous amount of support on Sat-
urday, I'm not alone in demanding that Senate vote over-
whelmingly to demand that Aramark negotiate with the
Coalition of Immokalee Workers to bring an end to the
abuses and exploitation in Immokalee.
Come out at 7:30 p.m. to Reitz Union Room 282 and tell
Senate that you stand with the Immokalee workers and that
you won't tolerate these human rights abuses any longer.
Dave Schneider is the Progress Party president.

Festival features Asian life 1
By MARIA PIQUET
Alligator Contributing Writer
East met West at Gainesville's Heart of
Florida Asian Festival on Sunday.
Held at the historic Thomas Center, the
festival showcased aspects of Asian culture,
including food, music, art and dance, and
allowed Asian-Americans to celebrate their
heritage.
The pounding sounds of Japanese Taiko
drumming, the potent smells of yellow cur-
ry and the prowling neon dragons embod-
ied the different nationalities represented at
the festival.
Sections of the Thomas Center's lawn
were turned into a food court featuring
Asian specialties, a martial arts arena and a
stage where acts such as the Sino Elite Ac-
robatics Group and the UF Bhangra Dance
Club performed.
Inside in the Thomas Center's Spanish
Court, Indian Dance Medley gave audienc-
es a taste of Bollywood dance and the folk
dance Kummi.
In the Long Gallery, guests received an
introduction to Chinese painting and Per-
sian calligraphy.
Stewart Thomas, who said he has been
doing calligraphy his whole life, gave art
demonstrations and tips about the art.
In fluid movements, he painted black
strokes onto sheets of rice paper, creating
Arabic symbols, Koi fish and Gothic letter-
ing.
"There's a lot to be said of calligraphy as
an art form," Thomas said. "Type font used
to be rare. Now it's what is actually done by
hand that is special."
Gail Liuzzo came from Micanopy with
her daughter, Jovanna, 8, to be immersed inanother culture.
With a henna tattoo of a flower delicately
painted on her hand, Jovanna said she espe-
cially liked the Indian culture represented
at the festival.
Liuzzo was impressed by the dancing
Chinese dragons and the performance by
Chinese acrobat Liang.
"There's a lot to be said of cal-
ligraphy as an art form. Type font
used to be rare. Now it's what
is actually done by hand that is
special."
Stewart Thomas
calligrapher
"It was incredible," Liuzzo said. "She
was on a unicycle balancing plates and
throwing them up with her foot. She actu-
ally caught all of them, three at a time, just
pop pop pop."
Last year, Gainesville held a similar but
smaller-scale festival that featured only Chi-
nese culture.
After winning Alachua County's Tourist
Product Development grant, the city broad-
ened the scope of the festival to all of Asia.
"That grant allowed us to do a lot of the
things we hoped we would be able to do,"
said David Ballard, Gainesville event coor-
dinator and Heart of Florida festival direc-
tor.
The grant also made free admission to
the festival possible.
The city already reserved the Thomas
Center for the same weekend next year, and
Ballard said the organizers hope to make it
a two-day event.Li Riggs, from the Sino Elite Acrobats of Orlando, spins plates in front of spectators at the
Thomas Center Sunday afternoon during the Heart of Florida Asian Festival.

Defense holds MSU
without touchdown
Harrison Diamond/ Alligator Staff
UF linebacker Dustin Doe returns an interception for a touchdown while MSU's Brandon McRae tries to
strip Doe during the Gators' 29-19 win in Davis Wade Stadium in Starkville, Miss., on Saturday.* THE UNIT OUTSCORED THE
BULLDOGS' OFFENSE.
By KYLE MAISTRI
Alligator Staff Writer
kma istri@alligator org
STARKVILLE, Miss. -The fi-
nal score didn't reflect the perfor-
mance of the Florida defense Sat-
urday night at Mississippi State.
The Gators held the Bulldogs'
offense to two field goals, marking
the fourth game this season that
an opponent has not been able to
score an offensive touchdown.
The other 13 points scored by
MSU in UF's 29-19 win came as a
result of two interception returns
for touchdowns by cornerback
Johnthan Banks -something
that fired up Florida's defense.
MSU's offense finished with 237
total yards on the game and only
scored three second-half points.
"Guys are emotional, espe-
cially when you get interceptions
for touchdowns," senior line-
backer Ryan Stamper said. "They
get 19 points, it looks like -if I
would've just turned on my TV-it would've looked like the de-
fense wasn't playing well, but you
know we're playing pretty good.
We got turnovers tonight, too."
Three of them to be exact.
Linebackers A.J. Jones and
Dustin Doe each intercepted MSU
quarterback Tyson Lee, with Doe
returning his 23 yards for a touch-
down in the fourth quarter to put
the Gators up 29-13.
Safety Major Wright added
the final interception with 4:01
remaining in the game and ap-
peared to clinch the win.
On the next play, however, UF
quarterback Tim Tebow dropped
back to pass in his own end zone
and threw one of those intercep-
tions for touchdowns that Stamp-
er was talking about, making the
game a lot closer than perhaps it
should have been.
"I was just thinking about how
I messed it up," coach Urban Mey-
er said of the play call to throw the
ball rather than run it. "And a lot
of confidence in our defense."
The defense earned at least that

Gators excel without Spikes
STARKVILLE, Miss.Brandon Spikes is the best player on Florida's defense,
but he isn't the reason the
unit is great.
Obviously, when he is on the
field, the Gators are better.
But even without him, the de-
fense would still be one of the best
in the nation.
The other players have shown
they don't need Spikes on the field
to shut down offenses.
In the three games he has mostly
missed due to injury -Tennessee,
Arkansas and Mississippi State -
the defense still led Florida to vic-
tory.
Spikes couldn't play against
MSU because of a groin injury, but
instead of looking like an incom-
plete unit, the defense showed how
many playmakers it has, starting
with the corners.

The Gators are back in a fa-
miliar position.
With five wins in the last
six matches, No. 12 Florida
(13-4-2, 7-1-2 Southeastern
Conference) is in control of
the SEC. South Carolina lost
to LSU on Sunday, and now
UF is in first place with one
match left.
Florida's latest win came
Sunday against Arkansas (8-6-
4, 2-6-2 SEC). Despite control-
ling play for most of the game,
UF needed a second-half goal
from Lindsay Thompson to
sneak away with the victory.
The Gators' deciding goalcame in the 64th minute. The
sequence began when senior
Lauren Hyde sent a free kick
from midfield into the penalty
box. After sophomore Sarah
Chapman deflected the ball
with a header, forward McK-
enzie Barney
found Thomp-
son, who was
running in from
Soccer the right wing,
and Thompson
scored from
seven yards out.
The sophomore leads the
team with nine goals and 20
points.
Although the Gators scored
just once, they had several
good opportunities, and they
could have prevailed moredecisively had one of their
three shots that hit the post
found the net instead.
Defending its own side of
the field, Florida succeeded
in keeping the Arkansas at-
tack quiet. The team's shutout
came one game after keeping
LSU off the scoreboard.
"This is when we should
be playing our best soccer,
because we have been playing
together for the last 20 games,"
goalkeeper Katie Frame said.
Coach Becky Burleigh
points to the effort of UF's
forwards and attacking mid-
fielders as a reason for the im-
proved defense. Earlier in the
season, those players were not
helping the back line enough.

Gators control their own destiny after sweeping Rebels
By ANTHONY CHIANG
Alligator Writer
achiang@alligator org
After falling two games behind
the Southeastern Conference lead,
Florida knew it had to win all of
its remaining matches to get back
in the race.
But the Gators have done even
better -they have won every set
in their last four matches.
Following losses by Kentucky
and LSU earlier in the week, No.
10 UF (16-3, 10-2 Southeastern
Conference) now controls its own
destiny in the race for a 19th con-
secutive conference championship
after it swept Ole Miss (8-14, 2-10
SEC) on Sunday 3-0 (25-18, 25-13,
25-16) to extend its set streak to12.
After trailing 8-9 in the first
set, UF grabbed the momentum
thanks to a 12-3 run to eventually
win the opening frame.
The Gators wasted no time
in beating the Rebels this time
around after being pushed to five
sets by them earlier in the season.
"No question we are playing
better in the second half of the
season than we were the last time
we played Ole Miss, and that's the
whole game plan -to continue to
get better," coach Mary Wise said.
In the first matchup against
Ole Miss, UF was outblocked and
committed 14 service errors to
only one ace, but Sunday it not
only won the blocking battle 9-2, italso dropped in five aces.
The serving game was terrific
all weekend, as the Gators were
able to pile up a season-high eight
Wiseservice aces in a
win against Ar-
kansas (11-12,
5-7 SEC) on Fri-
day 3-0 (25-12,
25-18, 25-16).
"It definitely
feels really good
for us to serve at
home," junior setter Brynja Rod-
gers said. "A lot of us take a few
steps back behind the baseline,
and at some gyms you don't have
that -in the O'Connell Center we
have as much space as we want."
Rodgers played a big part inthe team's successful serving per-
formance, as she tallied up five
service aces on her own during the
weekend.
Although setter Kelly Murphy
only had seven kills against Ar-
kansas, the sophomore responded
with a match-high 14 kills against
Ole Miss on Sunday.
"A lot of it is matchups, and
when Kelly was swinging today,
we felt like she had a good match-
up in terms of the defense Ole Miss
was running against her, so it was
part of the game plan," Wise said.
On Friday, senior libero Elyse
Cusack became the first player in
school history to eclipse the 1,900
digs mark and moved into third
on the all-time SEC digs list."Elyse has been the glue to
this team and has anchored the
serve-receive while working with
young players around her," Wise
said. "She is the heart and soul of
this team, and it shows every day
when she goes in to practice."
Now in a three-way tie with
LSU and Tennessee for second
place in the conference, UF is just
one game behind Kentucky with
matchups against all of those
teams still remaining later in the
season.
"It helps motivate us a lot just
knowing that we are in back in it
now," Murphy said. "Everything
just means so much more because
we do have a chance. It's up to us
now."
Florida holds Dixon to less than half of season average with depleted line
DEFENSE, from page 13_
ground, less than half of his season average
of 116.
His previous low was 92 rushing yards
against Auburn.
UF thwarted MSU's running game even
with four regulars held out with injury.
"There's a lot of experience. There's
some grown men on that defense, and they
played well together and they support each
other," Meyer said. "It's a good football
team. With four starters out on defense,
that's something."Among those held out with injury was
All-America middle linebacker Brandon
Spikes, who came out for pregame war-
mups but couldn't play when the whistle
was blown.
Defensive tackles Lawrence Marsh and
Jaye Howard and defensive end Justin
Trattou were the other three prominent de-
fensive players sidelined for the Gators.
Stamper, who had 13 tackles, filled in for
Spikes in the middle and led a stingy first-
half performance that set the tone for the
rest of the game.
The Bulldogs picked up 74 yards of totaloffense in the first half and went three-and-
out on each of their last four possessions
before the break.
On those final four possessions, MSU
totaled 8 combined yards,
moving backward on two of
those drives.
Yet, UF took a slim 13-10
lead into halftime due to theFootball offense's inability to cap off
drives with touchdowns in
the red zone.
"Our defense is playing well enough
that that score should have been differentat halftime," Meyer said.
The score was close, however, thanks
to red-zone ineptitude and a couple errant
passes. The offense's inability to convert
put more pressure on the defense, but that's
just the way the nation's No. 1 team in total
defense likes it.
"We try to not worry about what the of-
fense is doing because -to be honest with
you -we pretty much control the game,"
Stamper said. "If they don't score, they
don't win. We control the game, and that's
how we see it. If they don't score, they don't
win, and they didn't score tonight."

UF scores second TD in
last 15 red zone trips
FOOTBALL, from page 1
zone on its first four trips inside the 20, making the Gators set-
tle for three field goals and forcing a Tebow interception that
Johnthan Banks returned 100 yards for a touchdown right be-
fore halftime. Before Saturday, Tebow had only one intercep-
tion returned for a touchdown -Tennessee's Eric Berry did it
in 2007.
UF has now scored just two touchdowns in its last 15 trips
to the red zone.
The Gators, who allowed six sacks against the Razorbacks
last week, gave up three sacks to the Bulldogs.
"I know people are going to take shots," Meyer said. "We're
pressing like crazy. I think the head coach wants to score so
damn bad. We're not used to this."
In wins against Tennessee, LSU, Arkansas and Mississippi
State, Florida has scored just seven offensive touchdowns.
Tebow once again struggled to find options in the passing
game, completing only one pass to a wide receiver other than
Riley Cooper. Deonte Thompson caught a 19-yarder in the first
half.
Tebow missed open receivers several times
against the Bulldogs, including a handfulFoobalaround the goal line where the Gators failed to
Football punch it in.
"When you're open and you don't get the
ball, of course you're going to be upset," re-
ceiver Brandon James said. "But you don't know what the
quarterback is going through. You don't know what happened
in protection. You're just running your routes. You know that
you're open. You don't know everything else that's going on
in the back end."
The Gators did find some success in the running game, es-
pecially with Chris Rainey, who ran for 90 yards on 12 carries.
Rainey scored the Gators' lone red-zone touchdown from
a traditional I-formation with 9:08 left in the game to put the
Gators up 22-13.
Running back Jeff Demps left the game late in the second
quarter following a neck injury.
Meyer said Sunday that Demps, who wore a brace after the
game, has a sprained neck, and he is probable for next week's
game against Georgia.
The Gators gave credit to Bulldogs coach Dan Mullen, who
players said frustrated them with his knowledge of the Florida
offense.
Mullen spent 10 years coaching alongside Meyer and
helped the Gators average more than 40 points per game in
two straight seasons as UF's offensive coordinator before leav-
ing to become the head coach at MSU.
In three seasons under Mullen, Tebow threw for 6,390 yards
and 67 touchdowns and rushed for 2,037 yards with 43 scores.
"He's very frustrated," Meyer said Sunday during a confer-
ence call. "He's used to playing at a certain level. A lot of guys
are frustrated. We go down there (and win by) 10 points on the
road, and it's the same old song and dance as the last couple
weeks."MONDAY, OCTOBER 26, 2009 0 ALLIGATOR, 15

Gators dominate pair of meets
0 UF DEFEATED SEVEN
OPPONENTS.
By TONI-ANN MILLER
Alligator Writer
Florida's women's swimming
and diving teams had an outstand-
ing weekend all around, dominat-
ing two separate meets and defeat-
ing seven opponents.
Eight of UF's top swimmers
and one diver went to Texas for the
SMIU Classic, while the remaining
athletes faced the challenge of win-
ning in Fayetteville, Ark.
In Fayetteville, UF's women re-
sponded and took down Kansas
and Arkansas in the one-day meet.The Gators defeated the Razorbacks
175-133 and routed the Jayhawks
205-103.
Sophomore Anna-Liisa Pold led
the charge for UF. Pold finished in
the top four in
three individual
races and one
relay.
Swimming Freshman
Corinne Show-
alter also shined
for UF, finishing third in the mile
freestyle and fourth in the 200 back.
Showalter said there was some
pressure entering the meet to show
how they would perform in the
situation.
"We went in confident," Show-
alter said. "We were well prepared,and we knew what was coming, so
we were ready."
Instead of thinking about the
overall result and the pressure to
perform, Showalter added that the
team focused on each event and did
what the coaches expected.
"We beat people next to us. We
beat people to the wall. We won the
close races," Showalter said. "That's
all the coaches wanted us to do, and
we did it."
In the SMIU Classic, UF took
the lead after the first day of com-
petition and didn't look back. Led
by senior Gemma Spofforth and
sophomore Shara Stafford, UF won
the six-team meet with 353 points,
ahead of second place Louisville,
which had 309 points.
Burleigh decides to try multiple lineups
OCCE K, from page 13
"When the ball got behind us, we felt that was
the next line's responsibility as opposed to tracking
back and making it your own responsibility," Bur-
leigh said.
Arkansas' only threat came in the 80th minute
when Fraine jumped to catch the ball. While in the
air, an Arkansas defender pushed Fraine behind the
goal line, but the referees called a foul on the de-
fender.
"It was kind of scary because you never know
what the ref is going to call, because I was techni-
cally across the line," Fraine said.
Burleigh decided to shuffle the team's lineup af-
ter the LSU match to put fresh legs on the field. The
coaches considered having two lineups all season -
one for the first match of the weekend, another forthe second -but Burleigh said she never felt ready
to experiment until this weekend.
If they get past the first round, the Gators will use
multiple lineups next week at the SEC Tournament.
Florida was without two of its offensive weapons
for much of the game Sunday. Midfielder Tahnai
Annis sat out with concussion-like symptoms stem-
ming from a collision against LSU.
Freshman Brooke Thigpen, who is tied for second
on the team with 15 points, limped off the field with
a sprained left ankle in the 56th minute.
Burleigh said she is unsure of Thigpen's status for
this week, but she expects Annis to be ready to play
Friday, which could be crucial as the team prepares
for South Carolina.
While four teams can still win the SEC, a Gators
victory against the Gamecocks guarantees them the
conference championship.BOBBY, from page 13
very uncharacteristic game
against Arkansas when he
gave up two big plays, that
type of performance isn't
likely to happen again.
The run defense had pre-
viously looked susceptible
without Spikes, allowing 100-
yard rushers in the Tennessee
and Arkansas games.
It seemed like the Gators
defense would give up a big
game because Mississippi
State running back Anthony
Dixon entered the weekend
third in the Southeastern
Conference in rushing yards
and had topped the century
mark in five of six games (94
yards in the other).
Instead, Dixon was held
to his worst game of the sea-
son, rushing 15 times for only
53 yards.
A big reason for that was
Ryan Stamper, who moved
over to the middle lineback-
er spot in Spikes' absence.
Stamper made five of his 13
tackles on Dixon rushes.
The redshirt senior's big
game put him ahead of Ha-
den and Ahmad Black as UF's
leading tackler this season.With Stamper and com-
pany shutting Dixon down,
Bulldogs quarterback Tyson
Lee had more pressure to
make plays. That's where
Carlos Dunlap entered to re-
mind fans why he was con-
sidered one of the best defen-
sive ends in the country in the
preseason.
Dunlap had only two sacks
before the MSU game, and he
now has five.
In addition to the three
sacks, he also batted a pass by
Lee into the air for A.J. Jones
to intercept on the game's
opening drive.
Then, the random play-
maker of the game was Dustin
Doe, who wouldn't have been
on the field much had Spikes
played.
Doe was playing the weak-
side linebacker spot, which
is usually filled by Stamper.
Although Doe's six tackles
aren't overwhelming, his
pick-six put the game away
for the Gators despite his
bone-headed celebration.
UF has big-time players
who make plays when need-
ed all over the defense, and
that's why this is a top unit
and would be with or without
Spikes.
