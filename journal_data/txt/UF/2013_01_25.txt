Florida Gov. Rick Scott speaks outside Gainesville High School about the 2013 proposal to give full-time 
teachers a $2,500 pay raise across the state at a press conference Thursday.
JEWEL MIDELIS
Alligator Contributing Writer
Gov. Rick Scott talked 
about his proposal for a $2,500 
increase to teachers’ salaries across the state during a visit to Gainesville High School on Thursday morning.
As part of a trip to Tampa, 
Scott stopped in Gainesville to meet with GHS students and administrators while he toured the school’s Navy Junior ROTC program and the Academy of Health Professions.
After the tour, Scott 
discussed his plan to raise teachers’ salaries, which is part of his 2013 budget. 
Scott also wants to work 
toward an increase in K-12 education funding.
He said he believes teachers 
across the state deserve the raise.
“Our state and our school 
systems are heading in the right direction because of great superintendents, great principals, great teachers, great staff,” he said. “We need to compensate our teachers well and keep them here engaged with our students.”Scott added that the 
proposal still needs to go through the state Legislature in Tallahassee.
While many teachers are 
wary about Scott’s proposal, which he announced Wednesday at a school in Orlando, Karen McCann, president of the Alachua County Education Association, said she isn’t concerned.
She said she believed Scott 
wouldn’t have declared the proposal if the pay raise wasn’t his intention.
“There are deﬁ  nitely trust 
issues,” she said, “but I do feel this statement is deﬁ  nitely a step in the right direction.”
McCann said the $2,500 
raise will help balance out the 3 percent cut to teachers’ pensions last year.Scott tours Gainesville High, discusses teacher raise

Students will be able to weigh in 
on a change to allow bars and clubs in 
Gainesville to close an hour later.
A referendum question, which will 
be on Student Government’s Spring elections ballot, will ask students if they want bars and clubs to stop serving alco-hol at 2 a.m. but close at 3 a.m. 
The nonbinding referendum was 
passed by the Student Senate Tuesday night.
As of now, Gainesville law requires 
all bars and clubs to close at 2 a.m. The referendum will not change the law, but it will gauge students’ opinions on it.
Senate President Christina Bonarrigo, 
who authored the referendum, said a soft closing at 2 a.m. gives people time to be in a state where they can get home safely.
Nicholas Smith, general manager of 
The Swamp Restaurant, said he would support a soft closing and a later hard closing, even if it’s just 30 minutes apart.
“We have to be hoarding them out at 
2 a.m. like cattle,” he said.
If the referendum is passed favorably 
by students, Bonarrigo said the next step is getting city commissioners and the mayor on board.

UF President Bernie Machen questioned 
what the good life is in front of 733 people 
Thursday night.
Machen gave a lecture in the Reitz Union 
Grand Ballroom. The lecture in connection with a UF class called What is the Good Life.
He spoke about what he said are the main 
purposes of college and pondered what the good life is and is not.
“How about watching the bus pass you 
by when you have a 7:25 [a.m.] exam, not the good life, is it?” he said. “Receiving more texts from the UF Alert system than from your friends — deﬁ  nitely not the good life.”
Machen said the three purposes of col-lege are self-discovery , ﬁ  nding a career and making a contribution to society.
Under his presidency , What is the Good 
Life became a mandatory class for all fresh-men. Machen said he wanted something other than football to unify the incoming 
students.
“With 50,000 students 
from more than 200 coun-tries studying on this won-derful campus, I wished 
and hoped that students would have more in common than cheering together in a stadium,” 
he said. “I wanted them to gather around a playing ﬁ  eld of ideas.”
The event was organized by Andrew 
Wolpert, the coordinator of the course of about 3,000 students. Students taking the course were required to either attend the Machen says what's good

UF students interested in be-
coming involved with Student 
Government can attend informa-tional meetings starting today.
Information about qualifying

During the Spring elections, 
students are elected based on their college or how many credits they have.
Students with one to 30 cred-
its qualify as freshmen. Students with 30 to 60 credits qualify as  sophomores, and students with more than 60 credits represent their college. Seats are allocated based on each college’s popula-tion.
After qualifying for a seat, stu-
dents can choose to run with a po-litical party . Those who slate must be interviewed by their chosen party today, Monday or  Tuesday.
Slating will take place in rooms 
285 to 287 in the Reitz Union from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m.
The Students Party and the 
Swamp Party will pick their can-didates Tuesday night.
Students Party President Jen-
na Goldman said they will rigor -
ously interview applicants.
“We’re looking for student 
leaders with new ideas on how to serve the Student Body ,” she said.
Swamp Party Spokesman El-
liot Grasso said the party is look-ing for the best candidates.
“We’ve contacted our most 
qualified members to prepare them for interviewing,” Grasso said.

The 2012 musical comedy “Pitch 
Perfect” will come to life Saturday 
on UF’s campus.
The quarterfinals of the Interna-
tional Championship of Collegiate A Cappella, the largest collegiate a cappella tournament in the world, will be in the University Audito-rium at 7 p.m.
Students with a Gator 1 Card 
can buy tickets at the door for $12. General admission tickets are $15.
The tournament is put on by 
Varsity Vocals, an educational orga-nization. The competition involves six U.S. regions and an internation-al sector, said Lindsay Howerton, South producer and adjudication director of Varsity Vocals.
In this competition, eight a cap-
pella groups will compete, two of which are UF’s own: No Southern Accent and The Staff.
“When you arrange something, 
you kind of have a vision in your mind of what it will sound like,” said Alex Greene, music director of No Southern Accent and a 21-year-old UF materials science and en-gineering junior. “In your mind, there’s 16 perfect singers singing it, and when it sounds like what you heard in your head, that’s my fa-vorite part about it all.”
If No Southern Accent or The 
Staff advances to the semifinals, it will be the first time a UF group has done so in four years.
“Being able to share this art form 
that we’ve created is very fulfill-ing,” said Jabari Taylor, a 22-year-old UF fifth-year landscape archi-tecture major and the The Staff’s music director.
The first- and second-place 
groups will advance to the semifi-nals, held at Vanderbilt University on March 23.A cappella at UF Saturday

or watch it online.
“One of the things we’re trying to do with this course is create a common UF experience that sort of paves the way for students as they enter the university,” Wolpert said.
Every semester, the course in-structors invite an inspirational speaker to address the class. Last se-mester, the lecture featured George Rupp, the former president of Rice University and Columbia Univer -
sity, and current CEO and president of the International Rescue Commit-tee, which responds to humanitar -
ian crises.  
Besides attending a lecture ev-
ery semester, students in the class are required to participate in two other outside activities. This semes-ter, those activities include a perfor -
mance at the Phillips Center for the Performing Arts and a tour of the Samuel P . Harn Museum of Art.
“We use these activities to show 
how these questions and ideas we’re raising in class touch on all aspects of the students’ lives,” Wolpert said.
After the lecture, Machen opened 
the floor for a Q-and-A session.
When asked if he believes he is 
living the good life, Machen said he has the best job in the world.
“In fact, I can’t give it up,” he 
said. “Like all journeys, the journey through college can be a destination all by itself.”“It will help contribute to what has been lost,” she said.
For GHS students and administrators, Scott’s visit was a 
pleasant surprise.
“Any time we have an elected public official come in and 
talk with teachers and students and see the great things we’re doing in the classroom is a wonderful thing,” GHS Principal David Shelnutt said.
Shelnutt said he felt Scott’s proposal will help improve 
Florida’s education system.
“I think that all of our elected officials want to try to help 
our students and the state be as strong as it can be,” he said.
Shannon Patrick, 17, senior class president for GHS, said 
she was excited to meet Scott during his tour.
“It’s awesome he came to our school,” she said. “He was 
very personable.”
Alachua County Public School District Superintendent 
Daniel Boyd Jr. said he thought Scott stopping at GHS and touring the school showed that he cares about education.
“I think it’s an honor and a privilege to host the governor,” 
he said. “I told the kids that this is one of those things they should never forget.”4, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, JANUARY 25, 2013

Journey back in time to the era of 
King Arthur — when knights glistened 
in armor upon horseback and the me-lodic tempo of a pan flute could be heard throughout the village.
The Middle Ages will come alive at 
the 27th Annual Hoggetowne Medieval Faire, taking place this weekend and again Feb. 1 through Feb. 3 at the Ala-chua County Fairgrounds.
Events coordinator Linda Piper said 
she’s confident the turnout will surpass last year’s 55,000 attendees.
“Fifty-seven percent of our visitors 
come from outside the community , which plays a role in the huge economic impact the Faire has on the community,” Piper said.
The fair will open its gates Saturday , allowing visitors to spend time partak-ing in attractions such as the jousting duel and human-powered push rides.
New attractions include “Fools of 
Fortune,” a juggling act, and “Jypsy Jest-er,” which features the acrobatic stylings of sisters Topsy and Turvy.
Entertainment coordinator Bill 
Hutchinson said he is excited about the new additions and welcomes “Fools of Fortune,” which is composed of three re-turning performers.
“It should be an exciting treat to see 
them perform together,” Hutchinson said.
Gates are open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. 
both weekends. Half-price admission will be offered Feb. 1 from 9:30 a.m. to 3 p.m.
Admission is $14 for adults, $7 for 
children ages 5 to 17 and free for children under 5. Tickets are available online at www.gvlculturalaffairs.org or can be purchased at the festival.Gainesville goes medieval

didacy for Student Body president on Turl-

The current Student Government Senate 
president announced she would run as the Swamp Party’s presidential candidate in the Feb. 19 and Feb. 20 SG Spring elections.
Swamp Party spokesman Elliot Grasso 
said the party had a couple of qualified can-didates, but Bonarrigo’s qualifications were unparalleled.
“The choice was pretty clear,” he said.Bonarrigo, a 22-year-old political science 
senior, served as a four-term senator, as well as chairwoman for the budget committee, before becoming Senate president in Fall.
After the announcement, the Swamp Par -
ty had a board students could sign for plat-form ideas. Bonarrigo, who signed the board first, wrote that she wanted to eliminate all fees placed on graduate student assistants.
Her other platform points include a cam-
pus-wide clicker system, a soft closing for bars at 3 a.m. and no tuition increase next year.
Bonarrigo said she felt humbled to take 
on the challenge of becoming the fifth female Student Body president in the last 104 years.
“My personal goal is to make this univer -
sity the best it can be,” she said.
The Swamp Party will announce its can-
didates for Student Body vice president and treasurer at 12:35 p.m. Monday on the North Lawn.

Although parents may have good intentions paying for col-
lege, their help might be hurting their children’s GPAs.
Students who receive more financial support for college 
from their parents tend to have lower GPAs, according to a 
new study published this month in the American Sociological Review.
The study predicted that students who received more than 
$16,000 in aid from their parents have GPAs below a 3.0. It also found that students apply themselves less when they don’t have to earn their money for college.
“If you’re always given everything, there’s no motivation to 
really invest in it,” said Victor Harris, assistant professor and extension specialist for UF’s Department of Family , Youth and Community Sciences. “But if you have to work for it and create this educational experience for yourself so that you can be suc-cessful, then you’re more likely to be invested in it.”
Samantha Adams, a 20-year-old UF criminology and Japa-
nese junior, said she thinks financial aid, 
such as scholarships and loans, can motivate students to work harder.
“I know people who are on scholarships 
… I feel like they might actually do better be-cause they feel like they have this obligation, and they’re just harder workers in general,” she said.
At UF, 84 percent of students receive 
some form of financial aid, according to the 
most recent report from the Office for Student Financial Affairs. With about 97 percent of incoming freshman receiving Bright Futures, according to the SFA report, most UF students have a constant reminder to keep their GPAs up.“It’s a good way at the beginning of the semester to remind 
yourself what you’re here for,” Adams said.
However, the report suggested that students who have ex-
tra money from home are more likely to spend the money on social events and extracurricular activities, which could impact their GPAs.
Parna Daeimojdehj, 25, a UF building construction first-year 
graduate student, agreed.
“It is really hard to focus on your studies when there’s so 
many distractions,” she said.  
Harris said for students, education should be a priority, es-
pecially if their parents are supporting them financially.
“School is really their job right now,” he said. “A number of 
students work as well, but I think that the greatest gift they can give back is showing their appreciation by investing in school and showing through their education that they’re preparing themselves to be self-reliant and independent.”Study shows parental financial support can lower GPA

The general public can now 
hunt in certain conservation areas 
under a decision made by the Ala-chua County commissioners in a meeting Tuesday.
Public hunting is now allowed 
by appointment in areas including Mill Creek Preserve, Balu Forest and Longleaf Flatwoods Reserve. The ruling was made on the sug-gestions of the Alachua County Forever Hunting Business Plan, a document two years in the mak-ing.
The head of the project, Ramesh 
Buch, said the decision was made in hopes of opening up new forms of recreation in Alachua County. It will bring in no additional revenue for the county.
Hunting in these areas will be 
free of any additional fees, other than those posed originally by the state of Florida.
“We don’t charge other recre-
ation users for our land, so why charge hunters?” Buch said.
In remote or difficult-to-access 
areas, the county has entered into private agreements with individu-al hunters in exchange for caretak-ing.
“Each one saves us $10,000 a 
year, easily,” Buch said. “It was so successful that we’ve replicated that agreement eight times now. It was the start of us having hunting on our property.”
Buch went on to say hunters 
have been asking to be involved in this agreement since its inception in 2004. That’s partly the reason they began to look into allowing general public hunting.
“It suits our need to have care-takers at no cost to us, and they take good care of the land,” Buch said. “They send us monthly re-ports, so we don’t have to get out there every week, and hunters by and large are pretty good stew-ards. They’re invested in having a good experience.”
So far, reactions to the opening 
of the lands have been about 90 percent positive, Buch said.
But some are worried about 
the potential consequences to local wildlife.
UF assistant professor of wild-
life management Bill Giuliano at-tended the public meeting Tuesday night and said he believes enough regulation is in place to protect the population from overhunting.
“The county will use it as a tool 
to better manage those species and the habitats and parks they live in,” Giuliano said. “And in other cases, it will provide recreational opportunities for folks, which I think — as planned — is not go-ing to cause any detriment to those populations.”

UF will be flooded with school 
spirit Saturday as students jog 
through campus covered in or -
ange and blue powder during the first Gator Run.
The UF Alumni Association is 
hosting the 5K run to bring Gators together, to encourage student membership and to give back to the community.
Registration for the run begins 
at 3 p.m. on Flavet Field, and the run starts at 4:30 p.m.
Student Alumni Association 
philanthropy chairwoman and Florida Cicerone Mercedes Cas-tro said about 900 people have al-ready registered online. She hopes registration exceeds 1,000 on Sat-urday.
Throughout five color zones, 
hundreds of pounds of orange and blue powder will be thrown onto the runners.
“We wanted to do something 
that would bring the hype back into the UF Alumni Association,” said Castro, a 22-year-old market-ing senior. 
Castro said participants should 
come to the run with school sup-plies to benefit Project Makeover, an organization that assists local elementary schools in Gainesville.
The University Police-ap-
proved course starts on Flavet Field and goes through Fraternity Row. There will be a post-race cel-ebration on Flavet Field.
“It will be like a powder party 
after the run,” Castro said.
Former cross country runner 
Andrea Esinhart was looking for a laid-back way to run. The 19-year-old UF nursing freshman regis-tered with her Phi Mu sisters.

contribute to our movement.
It has been more than a month since the Newtown school 
shooting, and just this week there was a shooting at a com-
munity college in Houston.
If you watch or read the news, it can seem that things are 
getting worse all the time.
But are they really?Harvard University professor Steven Pinker argues that 
we are probably living in the most peaceful times ever, and he uses plenty of statistics to support his argument.
Assuming Pinker is right, why is it that things seem to be 
getting worse?
Part of it might have to do with the news.Professor Graham C.L. Davey of the University of Sus-
sex argues that the TV news sensationalizes its reports in order to compete with entertainment programs. However, such sensationalization can produce negative effects. Davey found that negative broadcasts cause sadness and anxiety.
These ﬁ  ndings have severe implications.The negative effects of stress on the body have been wide-
ly studied and found to contribute to all kinds of undesirable conditions such as obesity, diabetes and Alzheimer’s.
Perhaps worse than that, though, is the moral effect of any 
rapid-ﬁ  re media. A neuroscience group at the University of Southern California found that certain emotional responses, such as compassion, can be dulled when the brain is faced with continuous snippets of data.
Given the research, how might our media affect not only 
our sense of right and wrong, but our overall empathy?
How might they affect the impressionable, developing 
brains of children?
Might our culture contain elements that work to create 
tragedies?
Whether you agree with the current or proposed gun policies, we must come to terms with the fact that every shooter is a product of our own culture, a culture that each of us, knowingly or unknowingly, contributes to.
Are we living in a culture that 
is fertile for the creation of healthy minds? Is our civilization a shin-ing example of what ﬂ  ourishing humans can look like?
Are guns and anything having to do with guns the only 
factors contributing to the creation of killers? Are gun kill-ings the only fatal problems facing our species?
I’m not trying to detract from the importance of consider-
ing guns. Rather, I am attempting to draw some attention away from those we seem so ﬁ  xated on and contribute atten-tion to what may be root causes.
I’m not saying that we should delude ourselves, either.No rose-colored glasses are preferable to the bare truth.However, perhaps there is a healthy degree of modera-
tion that we should pursue when engaging in any behavior, be it reporting a killing on the news, interacting with our neighbors or contacting our Congress members.
Every action plays its own role in creating the cultural 
zeitgeist, no matter how inconsequential the action may seem.
A product of living in large communities can be a feel-
ing of social alienation and a feeling that the individual is powerless.
Remember, though, that societies are just groups of many 
individuals and that every individual adds to the whole.
So, which way are we headed? I don’t know the answer.But, if we’re to thrive, it will only be when every one of us 
takes personal interest and responsibility for our own actions to create a better future.

The times, they are a’changing. They’re changing into some-
thing weird and future-y . This week, Vice President Joe Biden held the ﬁ  rst ever “ﬁ  reside hangout.” Yeah. He sat in front of a ﬁ  replace while hosting a Google Plus Hangout and discussed “gun safety,” not gun control. We give a what-is-this-world-coming-to-are-we-the-Jetsons-yet DART to Google Plus. Ha, 
you thought we’d give it to Biden? No way. Never.
Don’t get too excited. This might not be true, because it hasn’t 
been conﬁ  rmed yet. Get excited, but don’t get overly happy . OK, we’ll just spit it out. It looks like J.J. Abrams is going to be the director of the seventh “Star Wars” movie. We give this a is-he-being-typecast-into-lens-ﬂ  ares-in-space-movies LAUREL to J.J. 
Abrams. He’s basically the only director we would want to trust with this weird job. He can do it right, right?
Do you use Internet Explorer? Stop. Stop using IE as your

We give a we’ve-grown-past-that-crap-yeah-your-browser-is-crap-if-it’s-Internet-Explorer DART to Microsoft. Y’all should just 
give up.
New trend alert: watching dogs Skype with each other. This 
is basically the only thing that’s been missing from our lives, and we didn’t even know it. Popular viral YouTube videos of dogs Skyping have garnered more than 700,000 views within the past month. Thank goodness. Finally something we can all agree on: how awesome dog Skyping is. We give an all-dogs-go-to-heav-en-but-not-before-they’ve-Skyped LAUREL to dogs!
During this ﬁ  rst ﬁ  scal quarter, Starbucks reports that its prof-
its rose even though its revenues didn’t meet its expectations. Uh, are we supposed to feel sorry for a massive global corpo-ration? Starbucks sometimes puts forward a friendly face, but really , they tried to beat Patrick Dempsey in a bidding war for a locally owned coffee shop in Seattle. We basically can’t trust them. We give a don’t-mess-with-McDreamy-we’ll-almost-al-ways-still-buy-your-coffee-anyways DART to Starbucks. Also, 
get more vegetarian sandwich options, and then we’ll talk.
Here’s something you should probably be aware of: John 
Kerry is about to be your new Secretary of State. He began con-ﬁ  rmation hearings this week, and the decision will likely be vot-ed on next week. He has Hillary Clinton’s blessing, as she was one of three people who recommended him during this process. Seems smart to ask her opinion on this one. We give an OK-but-we-still-only-remember-you-from-that-one-JibJab-video LAU-

Women are ﬁ  t to ﬁ  ght. Like, there’s no other way for us to

It’s harder to be overweight and in the military than it is to be female and in the military. So, suck it. We give a you’re-probably-super-sexist-if-you-disagree DART to lady haters.

Manti Te’o’s girlfriend 
never existed. 
Lance Armstrong 
never won a Tour de France 
cleanly. 
Most NFL players would 
hide a concussion to stay on the ﬁ  eld, and the NFL is being sued by former players about lying about the effects of those concussions. 
Coaches have hidden 
injuries for years. 
Pete Rose said he never 
gambled on baseball.
That is, until 225 pages 
of evidence proved that he indeed did gamble on the sport.
All of this leads to a single 
question: 
Can we trust sports? Or 
our favorite players?
There are so many layers 
of deception that need to be 
peeled away for the truth in sports to come out. 
Major league sports 
command some of the biggest audiences, and college sports programs aren’t too far behind.
We all know an athlete 
can’t be expected to judge his or her health, though, not when the team is losing and the game is almost over. 
The crowd cheers when 
its star can barely walk and trudges back to the ﬁ  eld of play. 
Stories like that are praised 
and gloriﬁ  ed as an ideal for all athletes to follow.
And we’re OK with that.What does that say about 
us, when we as society just accept the rampant dishonesty? 
It says we’ll buy an 11-
inch sandwich that claims to be a foot long because enough athletes are paid to endorse it.
More than that, it shows 
we don’t care. 
We don’t care about 
exposing the lie.
 Instead, we claim that a 
journalistic entity following up on a story is trying to ruin a person, and we become numb and apathetic.
But in a way, this has a 
roundabout effect of making the truth that much more valuable and effective.
When UF head football 
coach Will Muschamp called the team soft in November 2011, the shock value was divided into two main factors. 
It was shocking because 
a coach had the gumption to say something negative about his team, but more importantly, it was shocking because it was completely true.
When Jason Taylor (of 
Miami Dolphins fame) told his story about “dungeons,” where players were patched up in order to get them to play with as little pain as possible, it was a must-read story. 
It took the average person 
behind the curtain and let them experience the crazed mind set of the NFL.
Where do we go from here?
Social media lets fans (and 
reporters) get closer to the athlete, coach or owner.
Deadspin’s coverage of 
the Te’o story has pretty much restored the value in investigative sports journalism. 
A shift to honesty, to 
disclosure, to rationality as a whole could be on the horizon.
Unfortunately, that comes 
with the price of seeing the true personality of a prominent individual. 
It’s hard to construct a 
heroic narrative of someone overcoming the odds when the hero either cheated doing so, or embellished the odds in the ﬁ  rst place.
It’s even harder to 
construct one when the person is a jerk.
Maybe as well as shifting 
to better ideals such as honesty, we’ll see sports shift to making its participants more civil.
Or we can just continue to 
play video games. 
It’s not like the programs 
can lie to us — yet.

Can we trust our sports heroes?Column
A sentence that once seemed 
implausible is now a reality: I just signed into Myspace with 
my Facebook account.
For most people, Myspace is a dis-
tant memory of a prototypical social network that was basically a gloriﬁ  ed blog with an obnoxious amount of customizability.
Now, years after Facebook and 
Twitter forced Myspace into obscu-rity, musician and actor Justin Tim-berlake has released a new version of the site.
Despite the name, the site is 
nearly unrecognizable. Gone are the glittery backgrounds and annoying automatic proﬁ  le songs. Instead, the new Myspace is going for a simplistic proﬁ  le style, which asks for very little 
besides name, age, sex and a brief descrip-tion of one-self.
In fact, you can sign into the web-
site using your Facebook or Twitter account, which would seem insane to someone living through the social network wars of the early 2000s.
Myspace isn’t trying to compete 
with other social networks anymore. It’s trying to be “one more thing” in-stead of “the next thing.” As Google Plus proved a few years ago, it is ex-tremely difﬁ  cult to persuade people to jump ship to another system when they are so deeply invested in it al-ready.
The new Myspace homepage is 
made up of large tiles, each one rep-resenting a news story, band, movie trailer or music video. The tiles change depending on the user’s in-terests. The goal is to help users dis-cover new things they may like, in-stead of only viewing the things they already enjoy.
Timberlake’s focus is now on 
more than his music, but it is very clear that the new Myspace is music-oriented and hopes to compete with streaming options such as Spotify and Pandora.
The site aims to make sharing and 
discovering new music a social ac-tivity. Users create their own mixes and playlists that they can share with their friends, while seeing new artists and songs that may interest them.
This is an interesting middle-
ground between Spotify, which pri-marily streams music that the users choose themselves, and Pandora, which plays music randomly based on a theme the user chooses.
However, the big question is 
whether people want to add another tab to their online social activity.
With Twitter, Instagram, Face-
book, Spotify, Youtube, Pandora and more, it is likely that web users are already oversaturated with social op-tions.
For now, it will be most useful to 
fans of the indie music scene, who can follow and discover lesser-known bands easily and add and share new music to their “mix.” Indie bands may also have more success connect-ing with an audience if this format becomes a success.
We will have to wait to see if Mys-
pace can really return from the grave as another website to check every day or even take over for one we’ve already grown accustomed to.
For now, it’s just another pretty 
time waster to click around while you’re supposed to be working.

� THE LIFT WILL BE IMPLEMENTED 
BY MAY 15.
DEVON ABELMAN
Alligator Contributing Writer
During her Sociology of Women class 
Tuesday, Katie Nutter listed off rights ex-
clusive to men.
The next day, she was able to take ﬁ  ght-
ing in combat off that list.
Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta 
announced the lifting of a ban that kept women from being allowed to ﬁ  ght on the frontlines of combat Thursday.
In 1994, Secretary of Defense Les Aspin 
enacted the ban, which ofﬁ  cially excluded women from being assigned to units that may engage in direct combat.
Nutter said she was thrilled to hear 
the news and hopes Panetta’s decision is genuine and not just symbolic.
“I think we look to a lot of our social in-
stitutions for norms, for our expectations,” she said. “And I think it’s very discourag-ing that the military, such a huge and im-portant institution in the U.S., continues to reinforce inequality.”
Kelsey Harclerode, a 21-year-old UF 
political science and women’s studies se-nior, said this news came with a mixture of excitement and shock for her. She heard Panetta wasn’t supposed to make a deci-sion for a while.
“We are witnessing a historical mo-
ment developing in front of us,” said the Women’s Student Association advocacy director.
In a press conference Thursday, Panetta 
said in the U.S., it is “the responsibility of every citizen to protect the nation, and ev-ery citizen who can meet the qualiﬁ  cations of service should have that opportunity.”
Women make up approximately 15 
percent of the U.S. military’s active per-sonnel, according to the Department of Defense’s website. Now, about 250,000 jobs will be open to them and women who enlist in the future. Military departments must have plans for implementing this lift by May 15, according to the department.
Nutter said by lifting the ban, she hopes 
the military’s paternal approach will be re-duced.
“I want men and women to be equal, 
and that includes the not-so-pretty stuff. Yeah, I want equality because I want equal pay, but I also want to be exposed to the risks and the downfalls,” she said. “I think that is a big step — that women don’t need to be protected and coddled and patron-ized.”  
Panetta said in the press conference 
when ﬁ  ghting for the U.S., women are viewed no differently than men.
“They serve, they’re wounded, and 
they die right next to each other,” he said. “The time has come to recognize that real-ity.”
But Estefania Concepcion, a 22-year-
old UF sociology senior, said this is just another way for women to get hurt, even if it’s “one more step for equality.”
Nutter said this gives women more 
role models.
“Now girls and women can say , ‘Look, 
now I can do these jobs. Maybe someday I will be able to be a Navy SEAL,’” she said.

ment on the matter.Ban on women’s combat lifted  BUY IT. SELL IT. FIND IT. 373-FIND

Halftime felt different for 
the Gators on Wednesday 
night in Athens, Ga.
Southeastern Conference 
cellar dweller Georgia led No. 8 Florida 27-24 at the break. For only the second time this season, UF trailed after the first 20 minutes of play.
“I knew Georgia was go-
ing to come out (aggressive),” coach Billy Donovan said. “I told our guys, ‘How would you feel if you went on some-body’s court and lost by 25-30 points? You’d want to really come out and be aggressive.’ We knew they were going to do that.”
The Bulldogs’ aggressive 
play caught Erik Murphy and Patric Young off-guard.
Slowed by foul trouble, 
the Gators’ two premier post players logged just 20 com-bined minutes of playing time — 4:51 together — during the first half.
Young recorded his first 
foul 57 seconds into the game. After subbing in with 5:17 left before halftime, he recorded his second foul at the 5:01 mark.
Murphy had similar trou-
ble with quick fouls, record-ing his first 44 seconds after entering the game with 14:06 remaining and his second just 48 seconds after subbing in with 10:44 to go.
“We definitely battled [foul 
trouble] … with Patric and Erik being out,” Donovan said. “It really didn’t give us much of a post presence for about the last eight minutes of the first half.”
Compounding the problem 
was each post player’s paltry statistical output. The duo shot 0 of 3 from the field dur -
ing the first half and recorded three turnovers against one rebound.
The lack of production 
from Murphy and Young con-tributed to Florida’s second worst first-half offensive out-put of the season.
“When those two guys are 
off the floor, it’s going to hurt any team,” Donovan said.
Will Yeguete picked up 
the slack in the post. Despite battling tendinitis in his right 
Sophomore jumper Marquis 
Dendy has competed in the long jump, the triple jump and the 55m sprint this year. See story, page 16.

Ole Miss entered Thursday near the 
bottom of the Southeastern Conference 
standings after starting league play 0-5.
Valencia McFarland changed that for 
the Rebels. 
McFarland scored a game-high 24 
points and added 10 assists as Ole Miss handed Florida a critical 88-81 loss in the O’Connell Center. 
“She’s one of the best guards in our 
league,” coach Amanda Butler said. “She’s an impact player and has been since she was a freshman.”
McFarland, a 5-foot-4 junior, used her 
diminutive stature to find holes and create opportunities for herself and teammates throughout the game. She shot 9 of 21 from the floor and grabbed five rebounds and three steals. 
Butler challenged McFarland with dif-
ferent defensive looks, shifting from man-to-man to zone, but there was little stop-ping the guard on Thursday night.
“I described [Ole Miss] before we 
played the game as fearless,” Butler said. 
“[McFarland] certainly was their fear -
less leader tonight. She played a great game.”
McFarland said of her performance: “I 
just took what the defense gave me.”
In the first half, Florida struggled to 
slow an efficient Ole Miss (8-11, 1-5 SEC) offense. The Rebels — led by Gracie Friz-zell’s four three-pointers — connected on 9 of their first 10 tries from behind the arc to build a 50-33 lead with 1:28 remaining before halftime.
Entering Thursday, the Rebels were 
shooting just 26.3 percent on threes this season.
Ole Miss finished the game 11 of 16 
from the three-point line, much to the cha-grin of Butler. 
“We probably were the recipient of their 
best shooting night ever,” Butler said. 
Florida (13-7, 2-4 SEC) overcame the 
first-half deficit to pull within three with 3:30 remaining in the second half. Howev- Florida suffers third straight home defeat in loss to Ole MissMAX MATTERN

Florida’s first time on the field in 2013 
was more than an exhibition for fresh-
man Lauren Lea.
Since she was 10 years old and 
watched the Gators football team play on television, Lea has yearned to suit up for Florida. On Thursday night, the mo-ment arrived.
“It felt so great to finally put on the 
Gator uniform,” Lea said. “Watching these girls the last three years and see-ing how far they went, it was actually an honor to put on this uniform.”
Lea and Florida took down the Eng-
lish national team 18-13 at Dizney Stadium in its lone exhibi-
tion before the start of the 2013 season.
Gators coach Amanda O’Leary 
said capitalizing on only 18 of 38 shots doesn’t worry her because she is confi-dent her team will pull it together offen-sively.
“There were glimpses of brilliance, 
and we had some goals that I was in awe,” O’Leary said. “We have so many quality players, which makes us deep, and that’s a positive. I think we are right where we need to be.”

One of Sarra Lajnef’s most chal-
lenging obstacles was herself. 
Florida’s senior swimmer said 
she had difficulty dealing with 
anxiety before races. With the help of Jaime Jenkins, a licensed mental health counselor at UF, Lajnef said she learned to deal with the stress. 
“I had ups and downs,” Lajnef 
said. “It wasn’t great all the time. I got yelled at, sometimes, by coach (Gregg) Troy, and I’d go home cry-ing.”
But she said she knows Troy was 
tough on her because he cared and wanted to bring out the best in her. 
Troy succeeded. Lajnef was in London for the 2012 
Summer Olympics, surrounded by Gators, competing on the biggest stage possible. 
“She certainly was given the in-
formation she needed to improve,” Troy said. “Her learning curve is real big because she was very, very inexperienced. Sarra’s improved ev-ery year over four years. She’s given us a level of consistency.”
But before she was an Olympic 
swimmer, Lajnef endured a chal-lenging teenage experience. 
Born and raised in Tunis, Tuni-
sia, Lajnef and her family decided she should pursue swimming, but the lack of competition in Tunisia required a change of scenery.
Lajnef’s father dropped her off 
in Mulhouse, France. Their tearful goodbye was painful, but sacrifice helped paved her way to the Lon-don Olympics. 
“I didn’t want to deal with him 
because if I stayed with him, I would have cried,” she said. 
She spent her next two years in 
France but moved across the coun-try to attend another school. Lajnef transferred because of her relation-ship with her swimming coach who neglected her.
“They didn’t like people coming from the outside,” Lajnef said. “(The coach) didn’t care about me.” 
She moved to Brest, a city located 
in northwestern France. She spent the next two years there.
As she prepared for graduation 
in 2008, with the Olympics in Bei-jing, China, Lajnef itched for her chance to compete at the world’s highest level.
She found herself competing at 
the World Swimming Champion-ships in Manchester, England, that same year. But she fell short of her Olympic goal. 
Lajnef was distraught after miss-
ing out on a trip to Beijing, so UF as-sociate head coach, Anthony Nesty , urged her to take a year off. Lajnef listened. 
She stepped off a plane into yet 
another foreign country in Fall 2009, her first time in the United States. 
“When the plane landed I was 
like, ‘Oh my God, what am I doing here?’” Lajnef said.  
She could speak English but 
still needed help adjusting to life in the U.S. Senior Jamie Bohunicky roomed with Lajnef as a freshman, helping the Tunisian adjust to life in the U.S. Bohunicky introduced Laj-nef to bagels, among other things. 
“I can’t imagine at the age of 15, 
moving somewhere without your parents,” Bohunicky said. “That takes a lot of courage and shows how much of an independent per -
son she is.” 
With time and effort, Lajnef made 
the adjustment. 
“I’m turning into an American,” 
Lajnef said. “When I go home, I can’t eat food there.”
She’ll remain in Gainesville after 
graduating in May, training for the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. Troy is impressed with how much Lajnef has grown at UF.
“She’s very mature for her age,” 
Troy said. “She’s very worldly. She has a unique perspective on things. She communicates well with peo-ple.”Senior achieving dreamSwimming And diving

Two years ago, Jack Strick-
land phoned his loved ones to 
offer what little advice he had left to give and planned his final Thanksgiving for early August. 
He had stage IV metastasized 
Merkel cell carcinoma — a termi-nal diagnosis. 
What was once a pea-sized 
blemish slowly morphed into something problematic.  
Strickland is just one of hun-
dreds of former residents of Hope Lodge, a facility that pro-vides temporary housing to those seeking cancer treatment in the Gainesville area. Strickland and others find solace in an annual dinner at Hope Lodge shared with UF’s gymnastics team. 
“Here, it’s a matter of life and 
death,” Strickland said. “Medi-cal care is fantastic, but I believe emotional support is equally im-portant.” 
Every January, Florida’s gym-nasts help host a dinner for those battling cancer in an effort to pro-mote awareness. 
“These gymnasts are real 
special, and we support them,” Strickland said. “(Coach Rhon-da) Faehn is one of my biggest heroes.”
Since its inception in 2007, the 
Gators’ annual “Link to Pink” meet has raised breast cancer awareness.
Tonight’s dual meet at 7 
against No. 18 Auburn marks the seventh time No. 3 Florida has participated in the Southeastern Conference initiative. 
“It’s such an amazing oppor -
tunity for both worlds to come together and for us to honor sur -
vivors of our surrounding com-munity ,” Faehn said. 
Bill Larsen was a guest at 
Tuesday’s meal.He has been a Hope Lodge resident since Dec. 10 after doctors discovered can-cerous tumors along his Bron-chial tubes.
He went through his final stage of chemotherapy on Tues-day. Larsen has grown to appre-ciate the hot meals and small talk with the gymnasts.
“They brighten [the residents] 
lives with their individual sto-ries,” Strickland said. “These kids give us the courage to carry on.”
For Strickland, hope comes 
in both large and small doses. In the fall of 2011, PET scans re-vealed no traces of cancer left in his body . He said doctors were astounded.
Further scans and blood sam-
ples couldn’t explain the sudden disappearance. 
From that day on Strickland 
has been telling his story of sur -
vival. He has never shied away from being vocal about the im-pact the gymnasts have had on those fighting. 
Strickland will be in atten-
dance tonight, reciprocating the Gators’ support of Hope Lodge. 
“If they can struggle on bal-
ance beam, then damn it, I can battle chemo,” Strickland said.
Gators hosting ‘Link to Pink’ meetknee, he scored five points, recorded three steals and grabbed 
five of his game-high 11 rebounds during the first half.
Donovan said Thursday that the injury has been a season-
long issue for Yeguete.
“It’s tough, because I feel like I’m not 100 percent,” Yeg-
uete said of playing through the injury. “I can’t jump as fast or as high as I want to, but I just have to give my best when-ever I step on the court.”
While Yeguete’s injury 
still lingers, the junior for -
ward’s play as of late has encouraged Donovan.
“I’m sure that his knee [has], in some way, slowed him 
a little bit,” Donovan said. “But I think now, he’s doing the things at an intensity level, an effort level I’m accustomed to seeing him do things at.”
Yeguete’s performance proved critical for a Florida team 
battling multiple injuries. Murphy and Young’s foul trouble magnified the absence of Casey Prather from the Gators’ line-up. Prather has missed three games since suffering a high left ankle sprain during Florida’s 74-52 win against LSU on Jan. 12 in Baton Rouge, La. Prather will remain sidelined until his ankle undergoes a reevaluation prior to UF’s contest against Ole Miss on Feb. 2.
“We’re not a very deep team because of some injuries and 
Prather being out,” Donovan said.
“If Casey’s there, even with [Murphy and Young] out, at 
least you have another experienced guy to fill in. We didn’t have that.”
Until their health improves, Gators like Yeguete and Mur -
phy (fractured rib) will continue battling through injuries. But even with an injury-plagued roster, Donovan likes Flor -
ida’s chances.
“We haven’t played very many games this year at all with 
our full team, and that’s been somewhat challenging,” Dono-van said. “They have done a pretty good job to this point.”

Freshman scored two goals, 
notched assist in Florida debut
was senior attacker Ashley Bruns, who 
racked up a game-high five goals and two assists Thursday night. The senior admired how the freshmen began their college lacrosse careers.
“The freshmen are amazing, and we got 
people out there like [Lea] who can take care of the ball and finish their shots,” Bruns said. “We are really lucky as a team to have these freshmen here with us.”
Lea has looked up to the seniors since she 
arrived at Florida. She is thankful for how they have eased the freshman class’s transi-tion from high school to college.
“The seniors have taken me in and have 
made me comfortable to play with them,” Lea said. “To actually get in and play was amaz-ing, and I hope to continue to play and learn from these seniors.”
Lea scored two goals and recorded an as-
sist in her UF debut. Her first goal as a Gator came on a rebound.
Off of an 8-meter shot, senior Gabi Wie-gand shot the ball high, and it bounced off of England goalie Sally Keogh’s stick. Lea locked her eyes on to the ball and put her stick in the air.
Though Keogh jumped higher, Lea used 
her stick to bat the ball into the net.
“I was like ‘Yes!’” Lea said. “First goal as 
a Gator.”
O’Leary wasn’t surprised at all by the 
freshman’s play.
“You never have to yell at [Lea]; she is 
harder on herself than anybody could possi-bly be,” O’Leary said. “So with her, it’s a mat-ter of telling her to go out there and have fun because she always wants to be perfect.”LAcROSSE , from page 13

UF defense, hitting a layup and then a pair of free throws to help seal the win. 
First-year coach Brett Frank, 
who took on a challenging situa-tion at Ole Miss, recorded his first SEC victory.
The Rebels fired coach Adrian 
Wiggins and a pair of his assis-tants on Oct. 22, as well as self-imposing a postseason ban for this season following recruiting violations. 
Thursday was the culmination 
of continued focus and hard work despite the adversity, Frank said. 
“I could not be more proud of 
this team,” Frank said.
“Of the heart, the effort and 
the character that they have shown consistently throughout this season.
“They’re a resilient team. 
Many times they had the chance to throw in the towel and quit, but they didn’t. Every single day they keep fighting.”
The lone bright spot for the 
Gators was Kayla Lewis, who scored a career-high 23 points in the loss. Lewis shot 9 of 13 from the floor and pulled down seven rebounds. Junior Jaterra Bonds was left 
questioning the resiliency of her team. Bonds finished with 16 points on 6-of-20 shooting but had pointed remarks for her teammates following the game.
“I feel like there is no energy,” 
Bonds said.
“People are doing their own 
thing. … I just feel like everyone doesn’t care, isn’t buying into what we want to do and are try-ing to do. The end result is three losses in a row on our home court.”

Coach Mike Holloway knew sophomore 
Marquis Dendy was fast when he recruited 
him.  
And during the Gator Invitational on Jan. 
17 in the O’Connell Center, Dendy proved it.For the first time since his sophomore 
year of high school, Dendy competed in the 55-meter race, finishing second with a time of 6.31 seconds.
“I think it surprised a lot of people,” 
Dendy said following the race.
Setting up in blocks isn’t Dendy’s forte. 
Instead, Dendy has made a name for himself at Florida in the pits. During his freshman campaign, Dendy 
claimed eight victories in jumps. His biggest win came at the Southeastern Conference In-door Championships on Feb. 25, 2012 in Lex-ington, Ky. Dendy used an indoor personal-best mark of 8.06m (26-5.50 feet) to claim the long jump title.  
Although he has already succeeded in the 
long jump, he hasn’t seen the same results in the triple jump. Of his eight wins last year, only one came in the triple jump.
This year, Dendy is trying to improve his 
results in triple jump. At the Gator Invitation-al, he won first place with a mark of 15.33m.
According to Holloway, Dendy raced in 
the 55m last week to improve his marks in both the long and triple jump. However, Hol-loway sees potential for Dendy in sprints.
“It’s just part of his development as a 
jumper,” Holloway said. “When we signed him, we knew he had pretty good foot speed. Because of his health, we held him out of the sprints last year, but he’s healthy now, so we’re going to try to develop him in that area and see where it goes.” 
Dendy started practicing short sprints 
at the beginning of the fall semester. But a tweaked hamstring kept him away from the event until recently.
While preparing for the Gator Invitation-
al, Dendy set up in the blocks only once dur -
ing practice on Jan. 14. The next time he set up was during the preliminaries at the meet. Still, Dendy was pleased with his second-place performance and is excited to see how much he can improve in the event through-out the season.
“Hopefully, I can keep running and drop-
ping good times,” Dendy said. “Maybe I’ll run at [the SEC Indoor Championships], and if I qualify for [the NCAA Indoor Champion-ships], I’ll definitely run it. [Holloway] is all about getting a good amount of points, so I think he sees me as a very good candidate in running three events. I think I can do it.”
The Gators will send 52 athletes to Fay-
etteville, Ark., today to compete in the Razor -
back Invitational. While Dendy competes in the long jump this weekend, he has his mind set on a specific mark  — 27.5 feet.
“My mom said if I jump 27.5, I get a car,” 
Dendy said. “I have the car picked out, she knows that car and has it saved on her phone. I’ve sent it to her multiple times, so I know I’ve just got to jump that.”
