A year after Trayvon Martin’s death, about 45 people 
gathered at Bo Diddley Community Plaza on Tuesday eve-
ning, commemorating a life lost and demanding justice.
The event, hosted by UF Students for a Democratic So-
ciety, was an open forum.
George Zimmerman, a Sanford neighborhood watch-
man, told police last year he shot Martin, 17, out of self-defense.
Police’s decision to not initially charge Zimmerman for 
the shooting sparked nationwide controversy. Zimmer-man has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder in 
the case. His trial is set for June 10.
The event was part of a national SDS 
call for action to demand that Zimmer-man receive a guilty verdict.
Skye Schmelzer, a 20-year-old UF 
history junior and one of the lead orga-nizers of the SDS event, said Martin was an innocent life lost because of his race, and people need to remember him and continue to ﬁ  ght for justice.
But Schmelzer said Tuesday’s event is not just in mem-
ory of Martin.
“It’s about taking action,” she said. “When you take ac-
tion you can win your demands, and that’s what we are doing.”
SDS also demanded the immediate repeal of Florida’s 
Stand Your Ground law. The law, which allows for the use of deadly force in some cases of self-defense, was upheld Friday by the Task Force on Citizen Safety and Protection.

Newly elected and re-elected student 
senators raised their right hands and 
pledged as their victories were approved Tuesday night.
UF Supervisor of Elections Stephen 
Davis presented the Spring 2013 Student Body election results before the new sena-tors were sworn in. The senators present-ed then validated the results.
UF Supreme Court Chief Justice Matt 
Michel swore in the 50 new senators who were elected last week based on their col-leges and classiﬁ  cations.
The Student Senate held two meetings 
Tuesday: one with the old senators and one with the newly elected ones.
As the new term starts, senators have 
to vote for a new Student Senate President and Senate President Pro-Tempore.
Senators nominated Sen. Lauren V erno 
and Sen. Morgan Vollrath to replace for-mer Senate President and Student Body President-elect Christina Bonarrigo.
Verno won with 67 to 22 votes.
“I’m ready to serve 
the students and make the Senate greater than its ever been before,” V erno said after the meeting.
Sen. Cory Yeffet 
was elected as the new senate president pro-tempore to replace 
Daniel Landesberg, who resigned Tues-day.

The title for best falafel in Gainesville came down to a split 
decision.
Gyro Plus, Farah’s, Falafel King Sandwiches and Sababa 
UF came together Tuesday night for the first ever Falafel Fest 
at UF Hillel, located at 2020 W. University Ave.
Sababa UF came out on top in the popular vote while Gyro 
Plus won over the panel.
Both restaurants will receive a plaque from Hillel to go 
along with bragging rights as the best falafels in town.
Falafel, a common Arabic food, is a deep-fried patty made 
up of ground chickpeas and is often served within a pita stuffed with salad.
The event, which was free to the public, allowed partici-
pants to sample falafel along with pita and sauce from each restaurant before casting a vote.
Matthew Weithorn, chairman for Jewish Awareness Month 
at Hillel, said about 120 people voted along with a three-judge panel.
UF Hillel hosted the event in conjunction with the Jewish 
Student Union and with support from Islam on Campus.
The event was a preliminary celebration to kick off March’s 
Jewish Awareness Month, said Jeffrey Kaplan, a 27-year-old Hillel campus impact specialist.
Riley Sullivan, 22, co-owner of Sababa UF, said winning the 
popular vote accomplished his goal of “full falafel domina-tion” during the event.
Kaplan said the event was aimed to celebrate Middle East-
ern culture through food.
“A lot of people don’t always associate being Jewish with 
Middle Eastern culture,” he said. “Hopefully this shed some light on that.”

With a rise in temperatures across 
northeast and central Florida this win-
ter, the warm weather has increased the chance of possible droughts in the near future.
Don Brandes, water shortage coor -
dinator for the St. Johns River Water Management District, said the warm weather has caused plants to use more water for photosynthesis while more water from the ground evaporates.
“Conditions improved sharply dur -
ing the summer with heavy rains, but by fall it began to dry out again,” he said. “Even though we had very heavy rains during the summer, most of it just ran off because it was so heavy; very little of it soaked into the ground.”
Water shortages can also have neg-
ative effects on the ecosystem, which in turn can impact  people, said Wendy Graham, hydrologist and director of the UF Water Institute.
Graham said a water shortage last 
summer before Tropical Storm Debby caused a large algae bloom on the San-ta Fe River.
Although there is no way to predict 
climate fluctuations, Graham said rais-ing awareness about droughts and wa-ter conservation can be most effective.
“When it comes to water that peo-
ple use, the most discretionary use that people could cut back is for water land-scape irrigation,” Brandes said.Warm temps

Felines in plastic crates moaned and me-
owed as their owners unloaded them from 
trucks and SUVs, and set them on the rain-splattered sidewalk Tuesday morning.
Veterinary technicians ushered the cats 
inside and transferred them to stacked wire cages to await surgery.
The cats had made the journey to be 
spayed and neutered as part of World Spay Day in Alachua County.
No More Homeless Pets Inc., located at 
4205 NW Sixth St., provided spaying and neutering to about 25 cats at a reduced cost in honor of the occasion.
Sandi Richmond, the clinic’s executive 
director, said the number of pets that are eu-thanized by Alachua County Animal Control has dropped by about 86 percent since 2002.
This is largely due to citywide efforts to 
control animal populations, she said.
Richmond said she previously focused on 
adoption but realized limiting dog and cat re-production can be a more effective method to reduce the euthanasia rate countywide.
“We live in the tropics, where animals breed all year around,” she said. “Adoption was not the answer. We had to do something different.”
Jessica Ashley , the clinic’s lead veterinary 
technician, said neutering male cats takes about three minutes, and spaying female cats takes about 10 minutes.
After the animals leave the operating ta-
ble, she said, they get to go home. In between, they’re placed in a recovery unit while the an-esthesia wears off.
“We call it the beach because the animals 
are laid out on towels recovering under heat lamps to keep them warm,” she said.

UF’s Electrical and Computer Engineering Department re-
cently received a gift from a private donor in the form of a car.
Joe Harris, a civil engineer and owner of Harris Civil Engi-
neers, donated an electric 1996 Mazda Miata to the department. 
He chose UF because his brother, John Harris, is the chair of the department.
Joe Harris changed the convertible from a gasoline-powered 
two-seater into a car that runs an average of 26 miles on 10 12-volt batteries.
He decided to convert the car after his friends complained 
of it having engine problems. Their options were to buy a new engine or buy a new car. Joe Harris’ daughter, who was 14 at the time, suggested buying it and converting it into an electric car.
Joe Harris said the project, which cost about $7,000, “took three or four months of studying and ordering parts on the In-ternet.”
The original plan was for Joe Harris to get the car into work-
ing condition and give it to his kids to drive once they got their licenses. He ended up driving it to work for two years, and during that time he tested the car’s boundaries when it came to power. Joe Harris said he had experiences driving to down-town Orlando and the car almost died.
“Most light poles and shopping centers have outlets to 
plug it in,” he said. “I’d usually ask people if I could charge up first.”
The problem was managing the battery power of the car. The batteries in the car would not charge and discharge evenly , causing them to burn out faster. Joe Harris went through three sets of burned-out batteries before he started to look for an al-ternative.
“Should I buy more batteries or should I just sell the car?” 
Joe Harris said.
But he decided to donate it. He said he knows electric cars 
are the future, but batteries are not the way to go right now.
“I’m hoping that a smart group of people will be able to fig-
ure it out,” he said.
John Harris said this car will be a campus vehicle and will  
get people excited about electrical engineering.
“If we only wanted an electric car we would go out and buy 
one. We want to play with it,” John Harris said.
He wants to see the car being experimented on and used 
by students in the engineering field. The car is currently being worked on by a mechanic to bring it up to driving condition standards, but it should be on campus within a few weeks.UF engineering students take charge of electric car donation

Tina Lamb believes urinating 
or vomiting on a rapist might not 
work.
Lamb, the coordinator of UF’s 
Rape Aggression Defense program, said attackers are not concerned with physical attraction but instead are seeking control.
The University of Colorado at 
Colorado Springs caused a stir last week with an update to its pub-lic safety page suggesting women could urinate or vomit to deter a rapist.
The list of 10 tips for “What To 
Do If You Are Attacked,” which includes vomiting or urinating to deter the attacker, was taken down the next day and replaced with an explanation and an apology — but not before it hit the Internet. Users criticized the list by tweeting less serious tips and using the hashtag #UCCSTips.
Lamb said strategies like the ones mentioned in the UCCS list should not be relied on without substantial self-defense training.
“Ideally , a woman should have 
something other than just that,” she said. “There are no absolutes in this world. Nothing will work all the time, every time.”
Rape Aggression Defense, 
known as R.A.D., is an interna-tionally recognized self-defense program designed specifically for women, Lamb said. In the R.A.D. class, women learn tactics including verbal techniques, ground defense options and ways to escape bear hugs and choke holds.
The update to the UCCS page 
explains that the tips were intended to be used as a supplement to the R.A.D. course.
R.A.D. teaches women how they 
can protect themselves without hav-ing to rely on others.
“Our best success stories are 
women who never have to engage in a physical confrontation – they recognize potentially dangerous sit-uations much sooner and take pro-active steps to avoid them,” Lamb said.
She said people who take the class typically leave with a greater sense of independence and a realiza-tion of their physical power.
Having the confidence to look 
someone in the eye while walking decreases vulnerability, said Christa Parmerlee, a UF R.A.D. instructor.
“They know you’re there and 
that you see them,” she said.
Parmerlee admits to being shy 
prior to her experience with R.A.D. training, which she credits with building up her confidence. 
“What I love about it is seeing 
the look on the students’ faces when they have completed the course and seeing the look of ‘I did it,’” Parmer -
lee said.
Colorado university’s rape defense tips cause online uproar
The list referenced vomiting on attackers“I’d usually ask people if I could charge up 
first.”
Joe Harris
owner of Harris Civil EngineersClinic, presented a report to the 19-member task force in Sep-
tember that aimed to determine the impact of the law since its passage in 2005.
Worrell concluded there wasn’t enough data to find any 
solid connections between the law and its effect on Floridians.
“From the meetings that I attended while in South Florida, 
the public opinion was overwhelmingly against ‘stand your ground’ laws,” she said.
Worrell said the Criminal Justice Center and UF’s Depart-
ment of Criminology are continuing to research the issue.
Gainesville Police spokesman Officer Ben Tobias said GPD 
doesn’t take any official position on the law.
“We’re gonna enforce any laws that are on the books,” he 
said. “It’s not up to us to question or comment on those par -
ticular laws.”
During the rally , SDS members handed out petitions for 
people to sign asking state representatives to repeal the law.  
Victor Yengle, a 24-year-old UF economics senior, spoke 
on behalf of CHISPAS, a UF immigrants’ rights organization. Yengle said he was glad to see so many people in support of the cause.
“But it also saddens me because we are people of color who 
still have to fight for equality ,” he said. “We claim to be a nation born of equals. That’s no longer the case for Trayvon.”
Contact Alexa Volland at avolland@alligator.org.like to give some younger people the 
opportunity to serve a role here and impact the experience of students on campus.”
Yeffet won by 40 votes against 
Sen. John Bryan.  
“I’m looking forward to the up-coming term,” Yeffet said after the meeting.
Michel swore in Verno and Yeffet 
to their new positions, which took ef-fect during the second meeting.
Before the new senators were 
inducted, senators who were leav-ing gave farewell speeches thanking colleagues and giving advice to new senators.
Sen. Rachel Kellerman said good-
bye to her friends after two years in the Senate.
“We all get involved on cam-
pus for different reasons,” she said. “We’re all here for one reason — for the students.”
Sen. Kyle Collins left the Senate on 
a different note.
“I don’t have the time nor the pa-
tience to say everything that’s wrong with this body of people so with that I’ll say goodbye,” he said.
Bonarrigo chronicled her experi-
ence as a four-time senator. She re-minded senators to remember their districts, colleges and residence halls, and to not get lost in the big projects.
During Student Body President Tj 
Villamil’s report in the first meeting, he addressed the Students Party. He said although a prominent minor -
ity party is the check and balance of the Senate, the Students Party has weighed down SG with its rhetoric.
“The Students Party has no respect 
for the Swamp Party,” Villamil said.
He also congratulated the Swamp 
Party on a historic election.
“This is a Student Government 
you can be proud of,” he said.

In response to an emailed complaint sent to the Gainesville 
City Commission last year, county officials are considering 
changes to noise rules at the Alachua County Fairgrounds.
In the email, originally sent to city officials in September, 
Gainesville resident Eva Squires wrote that at 1:45 a.m. on Sept. 22, she was awoken by noise coming from a show at the fairgrounds.
Squires lives on Northeast 17th Terrace, which is about 
1.5 miles from the fairgrounds, located at 3100 NE 39th Ave. It wasn’t the first time she’s had to deal with the noise, she wrote.“This is, in fact, the second time I have 
made a trip over to said fairgrounds to track rave music that I could hear clearly inside my home after 12 a.m.,” she wrote.
The show in question was part of Life in 
Color’s E.N.D. Tour.
During a meeting earlier this month, 
county commissioners discussed potential fixes for noise at the fairgrounds.
Commissioner Robert “Hutch” Hutchin-
son said the commission is considering  time limits on ampli-fied noise. He suggested shutting off music between midnight and 7 a.m.
“We own the fairgrounds,” he said. “We can base the rental agreement for the fairgrounds on whatever reasonable criteria we come up with, and one of those would be that all amplified music be turned off by a certain hour.”
Robert Avery, Alachua County parks superintendent, said 
Feb. 19 he, too, is evaluating options and will make a recom-mendation to the county manager and the County Commis-sion.
The process, he said, could take four to six weeks.Avery said a change in noise rules could affect future book-
ings at the fairgrounds.
He added the rules’ impact at the fairgrounds would be 
minimal because few large concerts are booked there.
“Concerts will likely not rent the fairgrounds if they have to 
stop at midnight,” he said.Complaint leads commission to consider fairground noise control

she took one for the first time at a Tiësto con-

“I described it to people as literally the

Molly, a form of Methylenedioxymetham-
phetamine, has become one of the new drugs of choice for people wanting a high.
The drug can cause increased heart rate, 
increased perspiration and high body tem-perature, said Gainesville Police spokesman Officer Ben Tobias.
Tobias said the drug has been around for 
a while, but more people have started using it in the last three years.
GPD has made more than 15 arrests for 
possession of molly since Jan. 1, 2012, but, with the drug becoming more readily avail-able, it’s starting to stem into a more appar -
ent problem, he said.
“It used to be that MDMA was limited pretty much to young white males and fe-males. Now, it’s branching all races, all ages — people young and old are starting to take the drug,” Tobias said.
He said because it is a powder or a crystal-
line substance, it makes it easier for people to put anything into a capsule.
Tobias said it becomes more dangerous be-cause it doesn’t require any kind of pill press and essentially anything can be put into the capsules, such as baking soda or other toxic substances.
Users don’t feel the effects immediately 
after one pill, so they take another one and another and keep on that cycle. When some-one takes a drug orally it can take up to an hour for it to go through the bloodstream.
Priscilla, a 20-year-old UF junior, said she 
didn’t know what to expect when she took the drug. It made her feel tingly and happy.
“You get a lot of energy and all you want 
to is just dance,“ she said. Police seeing drug climbing in popularity among all age groupsHutchinson

Gun Control: 
Michelle Obama’s 
arms censored in Iran
We promise this will be the last Oscars-related editorial 
this week, but we feel the need to address the entire concept of Michelle Obama presenting an award dur-
ing the ceremony.
The whole show left us with a bunch of questions. Why did it 
take so long? Does Seth MacFarlane think he’s hilarious and not sexist? Where has Barbra Streisand been for the past decade?
Multiple times we thought to ourselves “WHY IS THIS HAP-
PENING AT ALL?” But that was mostly during the musical per-formances from movies that came out when we were in high school. Themed evening be damned, half of those performances weren’t necessary . 
Whatever.Another strange thing was FLOTUS herself “appearing” at 
the awards show to help present an award.
Some bloggers are taking it harder than others.“It is not enough that President Obama pops up at every 
sporting event in the nation,” wrote Jennifer Rubin for Washing-ton Post. “Now the ﬁ  rst lady feels entitled, with military person-nel as props, to intrude on other forms of entertaining (this time for the beneﬁ  t of the Hollywood glitterati who so lavishly paid for her husband’s election).”
“Her Deus ex machina moment was just obscene, and rather 
frightening in what it suggests about how low we have fallen as a nation,” wrote Joel Pollak for Breitbart.com. “Healthy societies do not create political personality cults.”
It’s one of those times when there was literally nothing to 
complain about and people still buried themselves in piles of spiteful hatred.
Susan Milligan, of U.S News, disagrees with the negative 
commentary.
“This is about people who so hate the Obamas that they sim-
ply cannot stand seeing either one of them getting attention or having any fun,” she said. “It was just someone who is famous in one arena crossing over to another fame-ﬁ  lled arena. So what?”
To fellow Americans, it probably wasn’t a big deal in the 
grand scheme of things. It was just a weird surprise in the mid-dle of a generally annoying awards show broadcast.
Did you know that FLOTUS’ dress was censored to cover 
more of her chest and shoulders in an image shown in Iran?
“Although modest by American standards, the designer 
gown, which exposed the shoulders and partial chest of the ﬁ  rst lady , violated the codes of modesty enforced in many Muslim countries,” reported ABC News.
“We’ve persistently seen Iranian news agencies, whether 
they’re partially or fully state-run, use fabrication and use other means to distort images,” said Patrick V entrell, the deputy State Department spokesman. “It’s something that we’ve seen in the past here in this department. We’ve seen photos manipulated. We’ve seen ofﬁ  cial statements manipulated. So there would be nothing new. It wouldn’t surprise me.”
Hush up about your stupid politics, Americans. Your ﬁ  rst lady is censored in Iran, a country that already 
didn’t like “Argo,” and that might be more important for once. After a few weeks of chaos, the Student Government elections are ﬁ  nally over. I’m not really sure who won. Oh, right, the same people as last time. But we 
call them the Swamp Party now.
I am like the majority of students at UF — I don’t care.I don’t care about SG. I don’t care about elections. I don’t 
care about these two opposing parties. I don’t care what they do with the $17.5 million to which my student fees contrib-uted.
They’re in my space. I just want to get to class.When I’m in the on-campus trafﬁ  c areas, such as Turling-
ton Plaza and the Reitz Union Colonnade, I try to not look at the leeches creating obstacles for me to get from Point A to Point B.
I talk on the phone, I text and I look away. I even try to 
walk away. And they follow me. This is harassment.  When they ask me if I voted, I say “yes.” I lie. Five seconds later, another leech asks me the same question. I lie again.
I’ve even traveled out of my way , past my typical route, to 
try to avoid confrontation and dishonesty.
It would help if I knew what these parties stood for, not 
who stood for them last week wearing their party’s attire.
The Unite-turned-Swamp Party is run by Greeks: the real 
Greeks and the wannabes, aka multicultural sororities and fraternities and the like. The Students Party is run by every-one else.
I’ll admit I’m at fault, too. I’ve been approached by many 
Swamp Party and Students Party supporters, all overly friendly and eager to talk.
I have never stopped and had a conversation with them. 
I’ve never questioned them about how their party can help me, how much they know about their party and how forced they are by their social organization to stand there and talk to me on a hot day of 90 degrees.
But I will give props to how polished the entire Swamp 
Party campaign is for having the best designed shirts and a well-organized and informative website that contains all the information I need, albeit biased, about SG elections.
I wish I saw this website before I was bombarded by stalk-
ers on my way to class. Maybe I would have voted.One major issue the Swamp 
Party faces is its branding. It’s al-ways the same party with the same people, just with different names.
Swamp Party , Gator Party , 
Unite Party and currently Swamp Party — again. Changing the name doesn’t change its image. We’re not that dumb.
The Students Party is the “oth-
er,” “independent” and lesser-known party . It is considered weak, new and inexperienced.
The orange shirts with a seemingly iron-on photo of the 
Century Tower are the worst. Is there a graphic design major who can design a shirt? You can add it to your portfolio.
I have always admired The Students Party for not dis-
rupting my day and for not being “in my face” when I am on campus. I knew that if I needed them, at my convenience, they would listen.
This year, however, it decided to market itself compara-
tive to the ever-strong Swamp Party; it campaigned right be-hind them by reaching out to us students. What’s confound-ing is that I saw two people who cut their orange shirt to tanks, like frat tanks.
Last year the election was very close; The Students Party 
lost by a record 114 votes. I thought it was making progress, slowly rising in popularity.
This year, it lost by more than 3,180 votes.What happened? Where did the supporters go? Did they 
all graduate or give up?
Life is tough. You can’t trust people anymore.Perhaps leeching around campus is not the way to garner 
our votes. It does get our attention — our negative attention.
All the attention I received the days before elections 
pushed me away from the entire SG battle. I felt power in lying to them about my voting status and felt power in not being part of their drama.

I recently returned from an incredible semester spent 
in America’s distant and more attractive sibling: Australia. My experiences there gave me a new per -
spective on — among other things — minimum wage laws.
While studying at the University of Canberra, I 
worked part-time for a pub near the school. Although this meant passing a bartending certification exam, it basically required knowing that alcohol poisoning is bad. Moreover, thanks to Australia’s obscenely high minimum wage, the job paid an impressive-sounding $23 an hour.
Because our dollar is currently worth less than Aus-
tralia’s, this ended up being a fantastic salary when I got back to the U.S. It was considerably less remarkable, however, when I was actually in Australia.
Unfortunately, it turns out that doubling every-
one’s wages doesn’t make everyone twice as rich — it just makes everything twice as expensive. Vending machines, for example, charge $4.50 per drink, and I couldn’t find a barbershop that charged less than $35 for a buzz cut.
I learned more about minimum wage laws while 
traveling around New South Wales. I met two young Germans who had come to Australia through a pro-gram called WWOOF, or Worldwide Opportunities on Organic Farms. In exchange for helping out on a small farm, travelers who sign up with WWOOF obtain free room and board all over the world and learn how to grow food in the process. However, because the work is unpaid, minimum wage advocates are less than thrilled about the idea.
According to a March 7, 2011, Redding article, Allan 
Griggs, a California farmer who participates in the pro-gram, is now “forced to pay his WWOOFers the mini-mum wage of $8 an hour if they work more than four hours a day,” which “may make it economically imprac-tical for him to use them in the future.” Minimum wage laws ostensibly exist to improve existing opportunities. When it comes to WWOOF, however, the laws are sim-ply taking opportunities away.
If this sounds like the exception to the rule, consider 
this: According to the U.S. Small Business Administra-tion, small businesses employ about half of U.S. workers. Like the Griggs family farm, these firms do not have se-cret pits of money they delightfully withhold from their employees. Whenever the minimum wage is increased, these businesses may have to employ fewer people. This, ironically , leaves the most downtrodden workers jobless and thus worse off than they were before.
Unsurprisingly, there is a wealth of research link-ing minimum wage with un-employment. A 1981 National Bureau of Economic Research paper by Charles Brown found that teenage employment drops 
whenever the minimum wage is raised by a certain amount.
In January 2011, a joint study by economists from the 
universities of Pennsylvania and Chile, titled “The La-bor Impact of Minimum Wages,” found that minimum wage increases have “a significant negative effect on the probability of staying employed.”
Conversely , the data minimum wage advocates have 
to offer is less than compelling and, frankly, suspicious. A 2006 Show-Me Institute Paper by Dave Neumark said the study “cited most frequently by minimum wage ad-vocates” is a 1994 phone survey of New Jersey restau-rants by David Card and Alan Krueger. Sure enough, the Economic Policy Institute — a think tank on the frontlines of the minimum wage cause — has cited this “landmark New Jersey study” as recently as July 2012.
However, in 1996, a different think tank, the Em-
ployment Policy Institute, thought to obtain the actual payroll data from these restaurants. A 16-page paper titled “The Crippling Flaws in the New Jersey Fast Food Study ,” showed that Card and Krueger’s numbers bore “no relation to numbers drawn from the payroll records of the restaurants the New Jersey study claims to cover.” Tellingly, even the most credible minimum wage advo-cates have continued to recycle this discredited study for 18 years.
The repetition, apparently , isn’t working. Even the 
U.S. Department of Labor seems to be aware of the damage these obstructive laws can do. According to the DOL website, exceptions to the minimum wage are now sometimes allowed for workers with disabilities, full-time students and youth under age 20.
If the minimum wage benefits the least productive 
workers, why on earth would those very workers seek to be exempt from it? Likewise, if raising the minimum wage helps the poor, why don’t we raise it by hundreds of dollars instead of a petty few?
The answer, of course, is that anyone who subjects 
these laws to common sense can see they make none. The minimum wage exists only because it’s been im-posed on us by utopians who cared more about wheth-er the policy sounded nice than how it would actually work.

Among the highly skeptical political appointments over 
the past month, Chuck Hagel’s appointment to the sec-retary of defense position has been the most controver -
sial. Why is that?
Hagel, a former Republican U.S. senator from Nebraska, 
is a decorated Vietnam War combat veteran and a recipient of two Purple Hearts. His track record on foreign policy and defense is somewhat liberal. 
The current Georgetown University professor has long 
been considered an isolationist in regard to foreign policy. In 2002, he wrote that the U.S. should be inspiring allies to work on “making a better world” as opposed to ruling by a sense of “divine mission,” particularly when accusing a country of having weapons of mass destruction without clear evidence — something Hagel was clearly skeptical of.
The Senate Armed Services Committee hearing last Thurs-
day brought together a shameful narrow spectrum of ideas, and here’s why: With the plethora of unique opinions Hagel has held on various issues, the most overwhelming topic of 
discussion wasn’t his support of chem-ical weapons in 1997. Nor was it his opposition to 2007 surge in Iraq. No, it was Israel.
Conservatives stamped Hagel as the 
biggest threat to Israel’s national security in ages, claiming he was soft on terrorism and a modest supporter of the Israel state. Democrats bombarded Hagel with questions, using the hearing as a time to exhibit their full-fledged support of Is-rael.
Hagel claimed that, above all, he was a U.S. senator, not an 
Israeli senator. This, of course, is referring to Hagel’s contro-versial opinion that the influential “Jewish lobby” intimidates lawmakers into supporting Israel’s foreign policy, even if it’s detrimental to U.S. interests.
What’s the point of staying true to traditional conformity 
when it’s not questioned once in a while?
If Israel needs $2 billion or $3 billion of our tax money ev-
ery year to comfortably defend our nation’s best interest, then so be it. Our mutual allegiance is an integral and strategically unique piece in the puzzle of world affairs.
If not, it may be beneficial to bring some back to those suf-
fering within our own borders.

sity of Maine.Hagel’s Israel stance

Drug-related deaths in-
creased in Florida during 2011, 
according to a Centers for Dis-ease Control and Prevention press release published last week. But since 1999, the num-bers have continued to increase.
From January 2011 to June 
2011, 4,329 drug overdose deaths were reported in Florida — a 4 percent increase from 2010, ac-cording to the Medical Examin-ers Commission Interim Drug Report.
A large portion of the over -
doses in recent years are related to the use of opioids found in many prescription drugs, said Barry Setlow, a UF associate pro-fessor of psychology and neuro-science.
“Opioids are more widely 
available and more widely pre-scribed,” he said.
Setlow said many drug users 
don’t realize prescription drugs can be deadly.
“Because they are prescrip-
tion drugs, they are perceived as being more safe opposed to heroin,” he said.
William, who didn’t want to 
give his full name, is a recover -
ing drug addict and a public relations specialist for Narcotics Anonymous in Gainesville.
He said he’s seen a recent 
increase in meeting attendance, adding that the support group’s population is also getting younger.
“There are a lot more people 
in their 20s and 30s than there used to be,” he said.
Setlow said prescription drug 
education and awareness could help prevent future overdose and abusers.
“Just because it came from 
mom or dad’s medicine cabi-net does not mean it’s perfectly safe,” he said. “These things can kill you.”Florida sees rise in

The dean of UF’s College of Dentistry is stepping 
down after about 24 years in the college. Teresa Dolan 
announced her resignation last week.
During her time as dean, she landed the largest con-
tribution to the college — $5.6 million from the Naples Children and Education Foundation. The college also remained in the top 10 for schools in the U.S. that re-ceive support from the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research.
Dolan said her time as dean was a success because 
the faculty worked well together.
“We developed a very collaborative culture,” she 
said.Dolan is leaving to become vice president and chief 
clinical officer of DENTSPLY, a dental product supply company . 
“This is a pretty unique opportu-
nity to work as a dentist in the head-quarters,” she said.
She begins her new job in York, 
Pa., on July 31. York, she said, is the home of the York peppermint patty , a treat she enjoys.
UF Provost Joseph Glover said 
Dolan elevated the college’s educa-tional and research programs to na-
tional recognition. He said he was sad to see her go.
“Our loss is Pennsylvania’s gain,” Glover said.Contact Colleen Wright at cwright@alligator.org.Dean of UF’s dental school resigns

“Two Rooms,” UF’s first 
production using American Sign 
Language, was performed last week. The play , staged by the School of Theatre + Dance, garnered about 200 attendees in total and was adapted to incorporate Deaf culture 
by the Signing Gators.
Joanna Byun, a 20-year-old UF 
sociology sophomore, was the lead 
actress and is Deaf.
“It’s really wonderful,” Byun 
said, speaking through a sign language interpreter. “I’m so happy that Deaf people are being showcased in this.”
In order to incorporate Deaf 
culture, the main characters were written as deaf, and two characters playing interpreters were adapted into the play.
Laxmi Woodham, who played one of the interpreters, said interpreting sign language in the play was a lot harder than it is in real life.  
“Normally , we would wait 
until we got the message and then start voicing,” the 24-year-old UF English junior said. “In the play, we were simultaneous, because we had a script to work on.”
Byun hopes the play will lead to 
more ASL productions.
“Really, this should be happening 
a lot more,” she said. “There are so many people who don’t know ASL or anything about Deaf culture.” UF students perform first ASL playDolan
“I’m so happy that 
Deaf people are being 
showcased in this.”

Tennessee’s Jordan McRae was 
too much for No. 8 Florida to handle 
on Tuesday night. 
McRae scored a game-high 27 
points on 9-of-20 shooting as the shorthanded Gators (22-5, 12-3 Southeastern Conference) fell to the V olunteers (17-10, 9-6 SEC) 64-58 in Thompson-Boling Arena in Knox-ville, Tenn. 
The junior guard’s 27 points are 
the most the Gators have allowed an opposing player to score this year. 
UF trailed 58-52 with 3:34 remain-
ing and had multiple opportunities to rally back.
After guard Mike Rosario missed 
a three-pointer with 2:54 left, guard Scottie Wilbekin cut the V ols’ lead to 58-54 with a layup. On UF’s next possession, guard Kenny Boynton missed a three from the right wing, giving the ball back to Tennessee. 
UT center Jarnell Stokes provided 
the dagger by making a layup and drawing a foul with 54.5 seconds left. He made the free throw to complete the three-point play and put the Vol-unteers ahead 61-54.
On the next play , Wilbekin drove 
down the left lane and found center Patric Young for a dunk to cut Ten-nessee’s lead to five.
But after a turnover from UT’s 
Trae Golden, Rosario was called for an offensive foul on a layup attempt with 28.3 seconds left.
“We had some very , very good 
looks and some drives and some plays and we did not finish plays, didn’t finish shots,” coach Billy Don-ovan said. “That was a big, big factor in the game.”
The V olunteers then made 3 of 4 
free throws to clinch the win. 
Rosario led Florida with 16 points 
on 5-of-14 shooting. Young added 15 points, while forward Casey Prather chipped in 10. 
Prather exited the game with 2:48 
remaining after taking a blow to the head from Rosario on a rebound at-tempt. Donovan said Prather might have a concussion. 
Prather has already suffered two 
concussions this season. 
“He may be out,” Donovan said. 
“Just obviously, it continues on. We’ll have to deal with it.”
Filling in for guard Michael Fra-zier II (concussion), guard Braxton Ogbueze and forward DeV on Walker did not take any shots.  
Florida’s lead in the SEC standings 
on Alabama shrunk to one game. The Gators play the Crimson Tide on Sat-urday in the O’Connell Center.

report.

Earning trips to the foul line has been any-
thing but charity recently for the Gators. 
Florida has attempted 262 free throws in 
14 Southeastern Conference games this sea-
son, an average of 18.7 attempts per contest and the fifth-highest rate in the conference. 
But during the past four games, the Gators 
have attempted just 36 free throws, a rate of nine per game. Opponents have attempted 85 free throws during the same span.
Though the sample is small and influ-
enced by Florida committing intentional fouls at the end of three of the four contests, coach Amanda Butler identified the low rate as a sign the Gators have failed to develop a strong inside presence.
“When you look at the games, in particular 
as of late that we have struggled with, low-block play has been central to that,” Butler said. “That’s where we’ve had a hard time defending. That’s where a lot of our fouls have come, and that’s where we’ve lacked a little bit of presence and consis-
tency.” 
Florida has faced two of 
the conference’s elite post 
players in the past four games. 
Texas A&M center Kelsey Bone, who is tied for third in the conference in scoring with 17.6 points per game, finished with 31 points in the Aggies’ 78-71 win against the Gators on Feb. 14. 
Bone attempted 11 free throws in the vic-
tory. Florida shot just seven as a team.
Three days later, Georgia forward Jas-
mine Hassell finished with 16 points and 16 rebounds as the Bulldogs defeated the Gators 62-57. Hassell shot seven times from the foul

Kevin O’Sullivan sat in the dugout and talked to his 
team for 20 minutes immediately following Tuesday night’s 
game. 
His message: Something needs to change. “It’s all on us,” freshman designated hitter Brady 
Roberson said. “They can’t teach us much more than what they’ve been teaching us. We got to start playing with pas-sion. We’re playing scared, almost. That’s not us.”
Florida (3-6) dropped its fifth straight game in a 7-6 loss 
to North Florida (6-2) in 10 innings at McKethan Stadium.
“This is not a time to panic or start pointing fingers,” 
O’Sullivan said. “We just got to play better.”
The Gators were again forced to lean on their struggling 
bullpen. Starter Keenan Kish lasted just two innings, giving up two runs on one hit and two walks. He threw 52 pitches.
Jonathon Crawford is the only 
Florida starter to last five innings this season. He tossed 5.1 hitless innings in Friday’s 8-2 loss to Florida Gulf Coast.
“Our starting pitching hasn’t been great,” O’Sullivan 
said. “We’re averaging, three-plus (innings) per start. I mean I know we’re on a pitch count, but I figured we’d be fur -
ther along than three-plus a start, so the bullpen has been worked.”
With the game tied 4-4 in the top of the seventh inning, 
the Ospreys took the lead when Drew Weeks hit a leadoff tri-ple to right-center off UF sophomore reliever Ryan Harris.
 UNF went up 6-4 two batters later when Tyler Marincov 
scored on a single up the middle off the bat of third baseman Paul Karmeris.
Harris threw a career-high 3.2 innings and 60 pitches. He 
gave up three runs and picked up the loss.
During Florida’s five-game slide, the bullpen has surren-
dered 24 earned runs on 34 hits in 30 innings. 
Through nine games last season, Florida relievers had 
thrown a total of 35.2 innings.
“We can’t go the whole year like this,” O’Sullivan said of 
the bullpen’s workload.

Hannah Rogers had a busy weekend.
The junior right-hander entered the Mary 
Nutter Collegiate Classic leading the Gators in innings pitched by 18 frames. 
When Florida returned from Palm Springs, 
Calif., she led by 22.2 innings.
Rogers tossed 18.2 innings in three games 
for No. 4 Florida (16-1) during the weekend, including 11.2 innings in relief.
No other Gators pitcher threw more than 
14 frames in the tournament.
Rogers’ first game of the weekend was sim-
ilar to most of her other outings this season.
The junior struggled with her command 
but overcame four walks to escape Loyola Marymount with a complete-game victory, al-lowing two runs.
“(I’m) just making sure that I’m hitting 
good spots and trying to keep the batter from guessing what’s coming,” Rogers said.
The Florida scored eight runs for Rogers, 
who averages six runs of support per start. 
“Your team’s hitting balls and scoring for 
you,” Rogers said. “It’s a lot easier to pitch when you’re ahead.”
Rogers did not start another game in the tournament, but she made her second and third appearances in relief.
Sophomore Lauren Haeger started Flor -
ida’s game against No. 6 Missouri on Friday but  pitched only four innings.
Rogers came out of the pen to start the fifth 
and tossed 7.2 frames.
Although she took the Gators’ only loss of 
2013, Rogers’ relief appearance against the Ti-gers was one of her best outings this season.
In nearly eight innings of relief, Rogers 
struck out nine and walked four.
She gave up two runs, but only one was 
earned. 
Rogers relieved Haeger for a second time 
on Saturday against Georgia Tech and made another strong appearance.
The junior fanned five without walking a 
batter en route to her seventh victory in 2013.
Sophomore Alyssa Bache tossed seven 
strong innings against Syracuse on Friday and tied a career-best mark with nine strikeouts.
While Bache leads the team in ERA, she has 
tossed the fewest innings. Rogers, the staff’s ace, will continue to get the brunt of the work in the circle.
“She competes,” coach Tim Walton said.“She makes pitches when she has to, and 
I’m very proud of that.”Junior pitcher taking on more responsibility for Florida

“They’re not just the best in the conference, 
those are two of the best kids in the country,” 
Butler said. “But then at the same time, we need to have a post player that is going to step up and say, ‘I am going to make this my job. I am going to be the one that makes a difference.’”
Butler has challenged freshman Christin 
Mercer to be the difference-maker UF needs.
With no room for error as Florida nears the 
end of the regular season and prepares for the SEC Tournament, Mercer said she is focused on being the inside presence the team needs.
“If we play strong inside and get to the free-
throw line, then other teams start to sink in,” Mercer said. “That’s when our guards have the ability to do what they need to do to, and it all goes together.”

Casey Turgeon led off with a single, and 
Jordan Shafer followed with a double. A Zack 
Powers groundout brought Turgeon home to make the score 6-5, and Shafer crossed home with the tying run on a Taylor Gushue sacri-fice fly to center.
UNF center fielder Alex Bacon reached on 
an infield single to begin the 10th.
After advancing to second on a sacrifice 
bunt from Kyle Brooks, he moved to third thanks to a Harris balk.
Catcher Corey Bass then hit a double over 
Harrison Bader’s head in center field to drive in the game-winning run.
“I feel like we’re going to come out to prac-
tice one of these two days and turn it around,” Roberson said. “We need the light switch to turn on.”
