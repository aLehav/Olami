Mercedes Machado, a ﬁ  rst-year mental health counseling graduate student, drove her car halfway into her neighbor’s condominium, Kensington South Condos apartment No. 801.

A week into the semester, a 
UF graduate student and univer-
sity employee has already hit the 
wall.
Mercedes Machado, a ﬁ  rst-
year mental health counseling 
graduate student, crashed her car 
through her neighbor’s south wall 
while parking the white Toyota 4Runner.
Gainesville Police left for Kens-
ington South Condos, 3901 SW. 
20th Ave., at 12:33 p.m. in response 
to the crash that left only the back 
half of Machado’s car sticking out 
of apartment No. 801.
Machado lives in apartment 
No. 802.
GPD spokeswoman Sgt. 
Tscharna Senn said Machado acci-dently stepped on the accelerator instead of the brake while she was parking.
Senn said the owners of the 
condo are renting out the rooms.No one was in the apartment at 
the time of the accident, she said.
“Thankfully no one was in-
jured,” Senn said.
Authorities waited to pull the 
car out of the apartment, because 
they didn’t know the damage to 
the structure of the building.
“She just drove into the build-
ing,” said Clint McDaniel, 28, resi-dent of the condo complex.
He said Machado hopped the 
parking block and the curb before 
she crashed into the side of the 
condo.
“Her tires were screeching. 
I looked up, and she was in the building,” he said.

◗ THE STORM CREATED 
8-FOOT WAVES.
MICHAEL S. DAVIDSON
Alligator Writer
Many Florida residents spent 
the weekend stocking up on 
canned food, ﬁ  lling gas tanks and covering their windows in antici-pation of Tropical Storm Isaac.
But for some UF students, 
plywood wasn’t the board that came to mind.
Surfers hoping to ride unusu-
ally powerful waves caused by Isaac kept one eye on weather re-ports and the other on the beach.
Andrew Bacha, a 20-year-old 
applied physiology and kinesiol-
ogy junior, made the two-hour 
trip to Daytona Beach to surf last weekend.
“Hurricane season is the only 
time I surf, almost because it’s the only time there’s waves,” he said. “If I don’t have class that 
day, I just go.”
The hurricane-powered surge 
came as a welcomed break from 
the average Florida surf, which can barely pass the 1-foot height mark on some days and remains completely ﬂ  at on others.
But in the storm, Bacha and 
other thrill-seekers found Califor-
nia-sized waves. They paddled 
out about 100 yards in the rain to reach 8-foot waves.
However, hurricane surﬁ  ng 
isn’t as simple as waiting for a water spout to form. In fact, it’s a science;  surfers closely monitor weather conditions when look-ing for their perfect storm.
Onshore winds can produce 
large waves but usually lack the power surfers seek. But if the water gets too choppy , it can be almost impossible to reach the best waves.Students surf Isaac

TAMPA — When Logan Stall-
ings walks on Turlington Plaza 
and sees anti-abortion support-
ers’ photos of aborted fetuses, 
he smiles at the students with the signs.
“You kill them with kind-
ness,” said the 21-year-old UF psychology senior. “That’s what you do.”
On Wednesday, he and sev-
eral other UF students joined 
a Planned Parenthood rally in 
Tampa to protest the Republican Party’s stance against abortion and other women’s health is-
sues.
The main issues brought 
up in the rally — birth control, 
abortion — are controversial on both sides of the political aisle. 
The Republican Party’s 2012 platform reads that “the unborn 
child has a fundamental individ-ual right to life which cannot be infringed” and supports a Con-
stitutional amendment to reﬂ  ect 
that view.
The issue has 
been particu-
larly charged 
in the past few 
weeks, between R e p u b l i c a n vice presiden-tial nominee 
Paul Ryan’s anti-abortion stance and comments by Senate candi-date Todd Akin, who suggested a woman was unlikely to get pregnant by “legitimate rape,” a 
comment that drew rebuke from 
Democrats and Republicans alike.
The rally, held at a park along 
Tampa’s Hillsborough River, at-tracted supporters from across the state who gathered into a small sea of pink shirts to lis-ten to speakers, sing songs and chant slogans.
A woman with a red cowboy 
hat listened to a speaker, while a small American ﬂ  ag tucked in her hat ﬂ  apped in the breeze. A burly man in a Planned Parent-
hood T-shirt walked across the 
amphitheater. Women in neon pink T-shirts clapped, their pon-chos dotted with water from a 
ﬂ  eeting rainstorm. A supporter 
dressed in a habit wore a band around her forehead reading, “Nun for you.”
Outside the entrance to the 
park, a single protester stood by an anti-abortion sign with large photos of aborted fetuses. The sign was similar to a truck that 
had driven around the confer-
ence area most of the day with an anti-abortion message on its Planned Parenthood rallies in Tampa

It’s not often that a college pro-
gram ranked No. 2 in the nation cuts 
its recruiting staff without planning to replace it.
But due to budget and contract 
conflicts, the UF International Cen-ter will not replace the recruiter for its Peace Corps program this year.
“We proposed a process to Peace 
Corps but simply weren’t able to come to terms with them,” said the dean of the UF International Center, 
David J. Sammons.
In the past, UF subsidized its 
Peace Corps recruiter’s wages. This 
year, UF won’t pay for a recruiter.
The recruiter helped students ap-
ply for the Peace Corps in the Hub.
This Spring, and for the second 
consecutive year, UF’s program ranked second in the nation in 
overall number of volunteers, with 
about 100 undergraduates.Amy Panikowski, who had been 
UF’s recruiter since 2005, said she is 
worried UF’s Peace Corps success 
might not continue after the recruit-ing office removal.
“UF has what Peace Corps 
needs,” Panikowski said. “There is a lot of untapped talent around campus that may not realize this is 
something they can do.”
Sammons said he hopes to keep 
the Peace Corps program at UF 
strong.
“We’ve been a very fertile 
ground because of the recruiter we had,” he said. “We’re going to offer the same services through working with volunteers that have returned 
as faculty members or are working 
in town.”Sammons said negotiating the 
return of a recruiter would depend 
on how the program fares this year.
Panikowski remained wary of 
the decision to remove the office.
“Students knew they could walk 
in, whether they were freshmen, 
sophomores or seniors, and talk,” she said. “It remains to be seen what that’s going to be like in the future.”

UF Peace Corps recruiter“You want the hurricane to 
be a couple hundred miles off 
the coast, so the winds aren’t as bad,” said Addison Staples, a recreation, parks and tour -
ism graduate student at UF. “It makes for big waves and clean conditions.”
The 29-year-old met three 
friends under clear skies at a busy St. Augustine beach Satur -
day . At 7 a.m., the waves barely reached their chests.
But as the day progressed, 
strengthening rain, wind and surf cleared the beach of all ex-cept about 30 surfers.
Staples and his friends 
weren’t deterred.
“Any conditions above your 
head are definitely dangerous, but I don’t get scared,” Staples said. “I think it’s the thrill of the bigger waves that the surfers go for.”
Bacha said he doesn’t think 
the practice is dangerous for ex-perienced surfers.
“The only people that would 
get injured are the people that aren’t good at surfing,” he said. After surfing during six hur -
ricanes in the last three years, the only thing he’s broken is his board.
Contact Michael Scott David-
son at mdavidson@alligator.org.side.
A handful of UF students stood 
among the cheering crowd, clap-
ping for speakers, like a 26-year-
old woman dressed as a pack of 
birth control pills.
For Stallings, coming to Tampa 
for a day was well worth making 
up work in his classes.
And even though he’s male, 
he stood among the mostly fe-
male crowd with his pink T-shirt 
in support.
“I feel what’s good for women 
is good for me because I’m around 
them all the time,” he said. “Their health matters to me because a lot 
of my loved ones are women.”
Tim D’Annecy, a 21-year-
old UF political science senior and president of Vox: Voices for Planned Parenthood at UF, said 
he tries to bring attention to local and state legislation that affects health issues. But this event was about bringing attention to the 
RNC and the Republican Party’s 
platform.
“I don’t think, personally, that 
women’s health should be a par -
tisan issue,” he said. “Women’s rights are human rights.”
He said he plans to continue 
to get the word out on campus about state bills that limit abor -
tion access.
Allison Sumilang, an 18-year-
old UF accounting sopho-more and member of Vox, said 
Gainesville is fairly receptive of 
Planned Parenthood’s mission, 
but that effects of health legisla-
tion go beyond UF’s campus.
“Reproductive rights — this 
affects everyone,” she said.

This Fall, $10 can open UF stu-
dents’ gateway to world-class per -
formances. And they don’t even 
need to leave campus.
Students can buy tickets to UF 
Performing Arts events scheduled 
for September and October at a 
newly reduced rate of $10 starting 
at noon Friday . Each student can buy one ticket per show.
Last season, UF Performing Arts 
offered three ticket pricing levels 
ranging from $12 to $20, said Todd 
Taylor, public relations associate at UF’s Phillips Center for the Per -
forming Arts.
To draw more students, Taylor 
said management decided to reduce ticket prices to what they were two seasons ago.
“Fifteen [was] way too expen-
sive,” said health science sophomore Ashley Goez, 19. “I could use that for a movie ticket and popcorn.”
Taylor said a Student Govern-
ment subsidy is financially “bridg-ing the gap” between public tickets — which can cost more than $50 — and student tickets.
Three performances will not 
qualify for the reduced pricing: two Broadway shows and an orchestra. Students can buy $15 tickets for these events.
There is no online ordering op-
tion. Students must present a Gator 1 card at the Phillips Center Box Of-fice or the University Box Office at the Reitz Union. Nonstudents can buy tickets at regular price and still 
sit next to student-purchased seats.
The sales period that starts Fri-
day spans the next two months. It 
will include performers ranging 
from Russian folk group Ensemble 
Basiani, the Tannahill Weavers from Scotland and Ragamala Dance from India.
People can accompany the Uku-lele Orchestra of Great Britain when 
it comes to UF on Oct. 21. Visitors 
are encouraged to bring ukuleles to play along during an audience-participation segment. 
Taylor said the performances for 
the September-October sales period will take place either in the 1,700-seat Phillips Center or historic Uni-versity Auditorium.
“We actually bring in artists 
from all over the world,” Taylor said, adding that UF Performing Arts rarely hosts local talent.
The Sept. 21 season opener will 
be Gainesville rock group Sister Ha-zel.
“I think the performers we bring 
in give students the greatest oppor -
tunity to learn about the culture of the world — in Gainesville,” said Michael Blachly , director of UF’s Performing Arts.
Students can visit www.perform-
ingarts.ufl.edu to view a complete list of upcoming UF Performing Arts performances for the 2012-2013 season.UF Performing Arts tickets on sale Friday
◗ HE AND THREE OTHERS 
ROBBED A FOOD STORE ON JULY 3. 
CHRIS ALCANTARA
Alligator Writer
A traffic stop Tuesday night led 
police to arrest and charge a man ac-
cused of using a sledgehammer to rob a northeast Gainesville conve-nience store in July.
Gainesville Police charged Di-
onte Detraun Rutledge, 18, of 668 NE 16th Terrace, with burglary of a structure, property damage exceed-
ing $1,000, conspiracy to commit a 
crime and giving a false identity to police, according to a GPD arrest report.
At about 8 p.m. Tuesday , GPD 
officer Anton Lipski pulled over a car in the 400 block of Southeast 11th Street with Rutledge a passenger.
According to the report, Lipski 
believed Rutledge may have been a suspect in an aggravated assault with a deadly weapon case in which he had an active felony warrant.
When Lipski asked Rutledge for 
his name, Rutledge gave the officer a false one. Lipski searched through police records and found Rutledge 
was lying, according to the report.
Police arrested Rutledge and 
took him to Ala-
chua County Jail. 
There, he refused to give his name, saying, “You know who I am” to officers. Jail 
staff used finger -
prints and a pho-
tograph database 
to identify Rutledge.
On July 2, Rutledge and three 
others allegedly planned to break into the 8th Avenue Food Store at 1634 NE Eighth Ave.
At about 3:30 a.m. July 3, in-store 
footage showed cameras shaking from sledgehammers slamming against the cement wall, according to the report.
About 45 minutes later, two men 
entered the building. They wore black clothing, gloves and ban-danas around their faces. The men 
snatched cigars, money and other 
items before fleeing from the store.
Rutledge allegedly caused about 
$1,000 in damage to the building, ac-cording to the report.
Since the July break-in, police 
have arrested three suspects con-nected to the burglary , including a 
16-year-old juvenile on July 12; Da-
corian Williams, 18, on July 13; and Christopher Williams, 23, on July 29 following a warrant for his arrest is-sued July 24.
As of Wednesday night, Rut-
ledge, Dacorian Williams and Chris-topher Williams remained in jail. Dacorian Williams’ and Christopher 
Williams’ bonds are set at $20,100 
and $30,000, respectively.
A bond for Rutledge has not 
been set.

Some people brag about own-
ing iPads or scooters, but UF fresh-
man Adam Samei impresses peers with a different fact — he owns his own Super Political Action Com-
mittee.The 18-year-old political science 
and international affairs student 
said he’s the second-youngest per -
son to own a Super PAC, a type of political organization that can raise unlimited funds to promote its 
agenda.
“It’s pretty cool to have one,” 
he said. “I think it will help me 
get more involved in the political scene.”
Super PACs were born out of a 
controversial 2010 Supreme Court decision. They can collect unre-strained amounts of money, en-dorse a specific candidate and, in some instances, not disclose their donors. Super PACs can also ac-cept contributions from corpora-
tions and unions.
Prior to the ruling, organiza-
tions were not allowed to officially 
endorse candidates and had to lim-it the contributions they received from each identified donor.
“The idea was that campaign 
finance was going to be regulated,” said David Hedge, a UF professor 
of American politics. “Super PACs 
skirt those limits.”
Samei said he was motivated to 
make his Super PAC, named Unit-ed Americans for a Brighter Future, after his father showed him a news-paper article profiling the youngest Super PAC owner. It turned out that Samei knew the 18-year-old, 
Alexander Iannacio. Samei felt 
compelled to one-up him.
“If I got the acceptance letter on 
my birthday , I could have been the youngest,” Samei lamented.
To complete the Super PAC 
creation process, he had to give himself a crash course in political organizations.
Samei had no idea what to ex-
pect when he visited the Federal Election Commission’s website, 
but he said he was surprised by 
how easy the process was.
“There was a link to about four 
or five pages of paperwork,” Samei said. “And then I hit submit.”
He found a treasurer, his sister, 
and a temporary vice president, his dad.
Now, Samei’s priority is adver -
tising and fundraising. He hopes to begin projects in September. One of his first tasks is creating a 
list for voters detailing different lo-
cal, state and national candidates’ stances on important issues.
“People need to be aware of 
who they’re voting for,” he said.
One of his other main goals, 
though, is still rooted in his rivalry with Iannacio.
“Now, the goal is to raise more 
money than he does,” Samei said.

When Emily Conwell walks 
on Turlington Plaza, she slips 
on a pair of earphones. She 
doesn’t want to hear the pass-
ing students say “that’s so gay” or “no homo.”
Phrases like those get the 
21-year-old psychology senior worked up because she said they hurt members of the les-bian, gay, bisexual and trans-gender community. According 
to a recent University of Michi-
gan study, the phrase “that’s so gay” actually causes long-term negative effects on these stu-
dents.
“Unfortunately, it’s a part 
of the conversation because it’s 
part of our vernacular today,” Conwell said. “It equates part 
of your identity that you can’t 
control with being stupid or ri-diculous.”
The study was conducted  
via an online survey. About 100 people said they had heard “that’s so gay” at least once in the last year, and roughly half said they had heard it more 
than 10 times in the same time 
period. Only 13 percent said they hadn’t heard the phrase at all.
The study’s lead author, Mi-
chael Woodford, said students exposed to the phrase expe-rienced frequent headaches, stomach issues and stress. 
They also reported feeling un-
welcome on campus. The study examined 114 students ages 18 to 25 at an undisclosed public 
university.
Woodford, an assistant pro-fessor in University of Michi-
gan’s School of Social Work, emphasized the importance of 
researching everyday interac-
tions rather than examining only rare violent cases of dis-crimination like hate crimes.
“We need to start looking at 
these more subtle cases of dis-crimination, which are actually more pervasive on campus,” he said.
LB Hannahs, director of 
LGBT affairs at UF, agreed. She 
said derogatory terms embed-
ded in everyday conversations are harder to combat because they’ve become socially ac-
ceptable.
Hannahs said she isn’t sur -
prised encountering the phrase 
“that’s so gay” hurts students.
“Hearing these things every 
day creates a heightened sense of awareness that can take place of focusing on things like school, friends and sleep,” she 
said.
She compared frequent ex-
posure to that kind of language 
to a constant poking as op-posed to a one-time punch in 
the face.
“Micro-aggressions don’t 
make you flip the first time — 
or even the 50th time,” Han-
nahs said. “But as they build 
up over your whole life, it be-comes a problem.”Study shows gay slurs

Check Ann’s facts 
ﬁ  rst
You know how Shark Week feels like it lasts for at least a 
month?
Well, Tuesday night was only the ﬁ  rst night of the Re-
publican National Convention.
Since this is kind of the biggest party of the Republican Par-
ty for every election cycle, the convention planners scheduled Mitt Romney’s wife, Ann, and New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie to speak.
The whole point of having those two give speeches on the 
opening night of the convention, when the public would prob-ably be paying the most attention, was to add human ﬂ  esh to the robot skeleton that is Mitt Romney.
And that’s ﬁ  ne, right? That’s what his campaign needed, 
we’d say . After all, when a presidential nominee says things like 
“I stand by what I said, whatever it was,” the campaign could 
use any boost it can get.
Ann Romney took to describing her and Mitt Romney’s 
humble beginnings as a young couple.
“We got married and moved into a basement apartment,” 
Ann Romney said. “We walked to class together, shared the housekeeping and ate a lot of pasta and tuna ﬁ  sh.”
That sounds like almost everyone here at UF.What she didn’t mention in her speech, however, is the fact 
that they were living off of stock options.
“Neither one of us had a job, because Mitt had enough of an 
investment from stock that we could sell off a little at a time,” she said in a 1994 interview with Jack Thomas of The Boston Globe, when Mittens was running for a Senate seat.
Huh. All right.During Tuesday evening’s speech, she also said that “Mitt 
Romney was never handed success.”
But in her 1994 interview, she said that the house they bought 
together in Boston for $42,000, thanks to a loan from Mitt’s fa-ther, cost less to pay the mortgage for than it did to rent. They sold it for $90,000 seven years later.
“So we not only stayed for free, we made money,” Ann Rom-
ney said to Thomas. “We had no income except the stock we were chipping away at. We were living on the edge, not enter-taining.”
At the RNC, she said their “desk was a door propped up on 
sawhorses” and their “dining room table was a fold down iron-
ing board in the kitchen.”
That statement matches what she said in 1994, but she said 
then “the funny thing is that I never expected help.” She never 
had to expect help, because they had plenty of investment mon-ey to live off of instead of scrambling to ﬁ  nd employment.
Listen up, guys, because this is actually important.By now, we’ve all been on this planet long enough to smell 
when something’s ﬁ  shy.
Does the story of the young lovebirds, Mitt and Ann Rom-
ney, sound humble? Living off of stock options does not a strug-gling young couple make.
Her speech sounds plausible — until you check the facts.Fresh start leads to hunt for passion
New sights, new people and new places to ex-
plore — such is the life of a freshman.
Yet, I am excited to be one of them. This year 
will be whatever I make it, and I plan to make it the best year of my life.
However, this may be a little difﬁ  cult, considering I 
suddenly have a new room, campus and city to get ad-justed to. Not to mention the challenging courses, push 
to get involved in student organizations and stress of 
making lifelong friendships.
Whew, that’s a lot on my plate.Little things, like suddenly noticing the overﬂ  owing 
pile of dirty laundry in the closet and needing to ven-
ture to the laundry room hidden in the stuffy basement 
or realizing just how far the bathroom at the end of the 
hallway is and that it does not allow for getting ready 
last-minute, suddenly become the real challenges.
Honestly, I am still too afraid to set foot on a bus. 
With many routes crisscrossing every which way across 
campus, who knows where I will end up if I get on 
one?
I have a plan — or at least I like to think that I have 
it all ﬁ  gured out. In my head, I have neat days ﬁ  lled with academics and socialization. My planner can agree 
with this, as every moment of my life is mapped out in 
advance.  
My obsessive attention to detail is ﬁ  nally coming in 
handy as the various meetings and functions that I am interested in happen one after another, usually at op-
posite ends of campus. I’ve never been much of a speed 
walker, but lately I have had to kick it into high gear. Even if I pump my arms and turn my feet over quickly, 
upperclassmen who have many more semesters of ex-perience than I do seem to saunter by me.
I am considering investing in a bike, but that may 
be a safety hazard to the entire community. Since my 
training wheel days, I have only been the occasional beach bike rider. With cars, scooters and pedestrians lining 
the roads and sidewalks, Lance Armstrong-ing my way to class 
may not be the safest mode of 
travel.
In Gainesville, there is al-
ways something that needs to be done, new people to meet 
and a new site to explore.
I’m living day-to-day, trying to make sense of the 
commotion around me. Learning new things is won-
derful, but having hundreds of them hurled at my head constantly is reason enough for a migraine.
I will need to learn the bus system just to replenish 
my supply of Advil and Diet Coke. I am ecstatic to be a 
Gator, but that doesn’t mean I am obligated to become 
a Pepsi fan.
On the upside, the classiﬁ  cation of “freshman” ba-
sically equates to a year of trial and error. There is no 
shame in having a full-scale meal plan, walking around 
with a map or getting locked out of the dorm room in 
just a towel. If nothing else, these adventures will make 
for great stories in the years to come.
Without majors set in stone, freshmen can take class-
es and join clubs based on their interests, not what is required of them. Every new student needs to be in-
volved; the opportunities that this campus has to offer 
are unlimited. But some of the best-kept opportunities 
require a little digging.
I’ve always been a goal-setter, but I occasionally lose 
sight of what I’m really after. This year, I don’t want to 
become lost in what’s going on around me.
My freshman goal is to ﬁ  nd my passion and fully 
commit to it.
Status: In progress.

With only two months to go until the 2012 elec-
tion, President Obama has an average lead in the polls by only a few percentage points, ac-
cording to realclearpolitics.com.
In essence, the race is tied.With the numbers so close, it’s really anyone’s guess 
whether President Obama will win a second term in of-
fice. It is often said that in politics, two weeks is a long 
time, and two months is an eternity.
A lot can still happen before Election Day.But some of the biggest determinants of the fall elec-
tions are largely out of the control of either candidate. 
For instance, neither has much say whether Greece 
chooses to exit — or gets thrown out of — the Euro Zone, which could substantially impact the American economy and thus the elections.
There is still great potential for both presidential 
campaigns to shift the 2012 election in a whole new di-rection.
Contrary to the glee that many of my fellow Demo-
crats felt when Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) was announced 
as Romney’s vice presidential nominee, I actually be-
lieve it was quite a shrewd choice.
As scores of Republican commentators have argued, 
the Ryan pick brought economic issues to the forefront. 
The national unemployment rate is 8.2 percent, and mil-
lions more Americans have simply chosen to leave the workforce.
It may not always be justified, but voters tend to 
blame the incumbent for economic problems.
Moreover, while the adjective “wonkish” is often 
used to describe Ryan, he is in some ways equally pas-sionate about social issues.
While many GOP voters are both fiscal and social 
conservatives, a substantial number of Republicans subscribe to only one of the aforementioned realms of conservatism, and it is important for Republicans to work to appeal to both major constituencies.
As in 2010, the Tea Party is making it difficult for 
the Republican Party to appeal to more moderate vot-ers. One needs only to look at headlines and the scandal surrounding Rep. Todd Akin’s (R-Mo.) inflammatory remarks regarding rape.
In 2010, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) 
was able to win a fifth term in large part because he had the good fortune of facing Tea Party member Sharon Angle. Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) may also be able to pull off re-election due to her opponent Akin’s lack of sensibility.
Consequently, the Democrats in this race have in-
creasingly made this election about cultural modernity 
and the GOP’s opposition to many facets of it.
The fact that the Obama campaign has decided to 
use the slogan “Forward” indicates that Democrats 
have worked to present themselves as the party of the future.
In some ways, this is a dangerous path to follow.Placing so much emphasis on representing the future 
leaves room for Republicans to portray Democrats as not being the party of the present.
The reality is that the United States is changing ec-
onomically, socially and demographically at a rapid pace.
These changes have caused increased social alien-
ation, as evidenced by the Occupy Wall Street move-
ment and the Tea Party.
That is the main challenge for Democrats: How do 
you present yourself as the party of the future when it is 
the future and the accompa-nying changes that scare so 
many voters?
Americans are uncertain 
about their futures. They’re 
witnessing the rise of countries like India and China as 
the United States’ global dominance seems to disinte-
grate.
At home, they see a stagnating economy. And many 
older Americans see a country that is being transformed 
in a way that would have been hard to forecast half a 
century ago.
That is why the GOP has rather unapologetically run 
as the party of the nation’s past.
One needs only to listen to a few minutes of Rom-
ney’s stump speech before hearing lines about “restor -
ing America” to its former glory.
The 2012 elections have come down to a debate be-
tween one vision that looks hopefully to the future and 
another that looks fondly to the past.
Who will win at this point is anyone’s guess, but 
much of the result will hinge on each party’s ability to 
present the aforementioned narratives effectively.

Presidential election is past vs. future UWire
In my hometown, we didn’t know any gay people. 
There was one openly gay student at my rural high school.  The nickname students gave him was “Quinn 
the Queer,” and a lot of us think he transferred schools because of the teasing.
As returning Gators know — and freshmen are soon 
to discover — UF is probably a much more open and safe environment for the LGBT community than the environ-ment they experienced in high school.  
Living, working and studying alongside gay people 
will no doubt lead many to evolve their stance on social issues to be more in favor of equal rights.  
I can certainly say that my experience as a Gator has 
broadened my understanding of sexual orientations and 
helped develop my political involvement.  
When I was in my first semester at UF four years ago, 
I hopped in a van with an unusual assortment of LGBT 
students, leftists and an Alligator reporter to attend the National Equality March in Washington, D.C.  
Cleve Jones, a gay rights activist and protégé of politi-
cian Harvey Milk, started the march. Milk, who was the first openly gay man elected to public office in California, was assassinated in 1978. The purpose of the march was 
to call for equal rights for the LGBT community — a mes-
sage that I was receptive to.
The National Equality March came in the wake of Cali-
fornia’s Proposition 8 passage, which eliminated the rite of gay marriage in the state. 
For an adventurous and wide-eyed freshman who 
wanted to better understand the world around him, the trip was life-changing.  
Marching to the Capitol alongside activists, politicians, 
celebrities like Lady Gaga and tons of regular folk was overwhelming.  The aspect of the trip that left the biggest impact on me was the people I met.  
From the Episcopalian church that gave us shelter for 
the night, to the members of our caravan, the collective 
atmosphere was one of the warmest and most accept-ing environments I have ever encountered.
I looked up to the gay 
men and women I met because they held their heads high and treated others fairly, despite the fact that society had often not dealt them the same courtesies.  I met lovers who could not marry, youth who had run away or been kicked out of their homes, and people who had been severely bullied by individuals and ostracized by our institutions.  
The most solemn moment was when a gay man from 
the Gainesville community whom I befriended admitted 
to me that he had once attempted suicide because there 
was a point in his life when the rejection and loneliness he faced became too great.  
A lot has changed since then.  I went on to become the vice president of the UF Col-
lege Democrats and later the president of the Students Party, a student government party dedicated to fiscal re-sponsibility and equal opportunity for all students. I am finishing my term. Along the way , I met many more LGBT 
Gators with both inspiring and heart-wrenching stories of 
their own.
I didn’t want to introduce my views in the debut of 
this column with a lecture or the demonization of differ -
ing opinions.  Sometimes, the best way to convince others is to tell a story.  
Though we are individuals, at the end of the day we 
are also Gators who are united by our common story at UF.  Being a part of this university will help students be-
gin to see past our differences and embrace each other as 
people with similar concerns, hopes and dreams.
It is hard to say whether our world will ever triumph 
over prejudice, but I am confident that the open-minded-ness fostered within this university will be a step in that direction.
Together this generation of Gators can help create a 
better world than the one we inherited.

Bryan Dubno overheard more 
than sandwich orders while stand-
ing in the Reitz Union Subway line Sunday. He stood between two UF students who were talking about 
one of his cherished inventions: the 
UFmobile iPhone app.
“It’s cool to see people actually 
using it,” said Dubno, a 22-year-old UF computer science and engi-neering senior.
On Aug. 22, the first day of the 
Fall semester, UFmobile was used about 64,000 times. Since Dubno 
created the free iPhone app in 2009, 
it has had 29,000 downloads.
His first app, Nutrifacts on the 
Go, received about nine down-loads in its lifetime. It was a project for the science fair his sophomore year at Spanish River Community High School, and it gave users nu-tritional information on fast food 
restaurants.
Despite its imperfections, the 
young developer was proud that 
he was able to create the app with-out formal training.
“It was on my own learning,” 
he said. “It gave me a sense of in-dependence.”
Dubno enrolled at UF in 2008 as 
an exploratory engineering major, but after taking a beginning Java course his freshman year, he dis-covered his passion for computer science and engineering.
“I had a great professor, and 
that’s what got me into it,” he said.
But the self-starter always had 
a curiosity for how things worked. He said that as a child, he would take apart little things, like a car set, to try to figure them out.
He also took advantage of on-
line resources and books at a young age, which helped set the path for nomtasticapps.com, which displays the other four apps he created: Translate FREE and StudySets for Spanish, Psychology and French, trumping the UFmobile app with about 300,000 downloads.
His latest additions to UFmobile 
— dining hall, library and tutoring hours and enhancements in the Wall feature (unread message noti-fications, the ability to copy posts and select chat bubble and crowd 
moderation) — were released in 
the spring.“I’ve gotten a lot of positive 
feedback,” Dubno said. “The re-views are heartwarming.”
Last August, he released the 
app’s redesigned version 2.2, which includes an augmented re-ality camera that allows users to easily pinpoint their classes’ loca-
tions, a UF news feed, an event cal-
endar, the ability to import course schedules from the Integrated Student Information System, RTS route information, a UF directory and a live feed from Southwest Recreation Center cam-eras that allows users to see if the gym is busy before heading over.
The app is popular among UF 
students and faculty and has been used in places such as Australia, China and Europe.
“It’s used all over the world for 
some strange reason. I guess the Gator nation is really everywhere,” Dubno said, chuckling.
Corey Flayman, Dubno’s 
19-year-old marketing intern, can 
somewhat account for that. Flay-
man’s uncle, a UF alumnus, intro-duced him to UFmobile while he was in high school, and he down-loaded it before he was admitted to UF last year.
“I was surprised when I real-
ized a student created it,” he said. “It was so effective. I thought it 
was a UF professional’s work.”
The telecommunication sopho-
more has been interning with Dub-
no since the spring. Although they communicate primarily via email, they are a cohesive team.
“It’s a nice relationship,” Dubno 
said. “It’s not like I’m his boss.”
Flayman said he likes that Dub-
no gives him the ability to develop his own ideas. It’s his job to pro-mote the app on social media and 
get people to download it on a day-
to-day basis.
“It would be nice if the univer -
sity picked it up,” Dubno said. “A lot of people still don’t know about it.”
As for now, word-of-mouth 
conversations in restaurant lines have proven worthy.

After you’ve been out for the night with your 
friends, Five Star Pizza just seems to call your 
name.
Eating cures boredom, but eating late at night is 
one of the worst things you can do to your body.
Weight loss is total calories consumed compared 
to amount of energy burned, said Dr. Donald Hen-
srud, associate professor of preventative medi-
cine and nutrition at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., as interviewed by ABC News. Late-night snacking increases calorie intake, making the sides unbalanced.
Despite the setback in weight loss, there are ways 
to get around it. Resist dialing Midnight Cookies when you’re up late studying, and try some of these healthier alternatives to keep off the extra pounds:
Frozen blueberries, raspberries or strawberries — They are ﬁ  lled with antioxidants that can help you feel more energized.
Multigrain pretzels or crackers — About a hand-
ful (one ounce) is a great alternative to chips and is about 100 calories.
Cheese quesadilla — Use low-fat cheese and a 
high-ﬁ  ber tortilla with no meat (meat takes longer for the body to break down).
Greek yogurt — It is high in protein, low in sug-
ar and it’s ﬁ  lling. If one serving doesn’t ﬁ  ll you up, add some fruit.
Dark chocolate — The darker, the better. Dark 
chocolate contains more cacao and less processed fat.
Avocado — It contains plenty of ﬁ  ber, which 
helps it pass through your system quickly.
Green tea — It isn’t exactly food, but it’ll help 
you get your mind off how hungry you are and ﬁ  ll you up with plenty of nutrients.THURSDAY, AUGUST 30, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 9

Dear mediocre Advice,
I hate it when little kids get in the pool 
at my apartment complex. Their parents don’t care how disturbing they are being. 
Should I say something?Dear Mediocre Advice,
I’ve been told by many men that most girls can just walk up to any guy, start a conversation and land them in the sack no problem. What is your take on this? Do you think it’s really that easy?
   Dear Friend,
No. Parents have it tough enough as it is. Ignore them and don’t fall for the trap and enter their pool. Yes, it’s their pool the moment they cannonball into it. Like a dog, they mark their territory. Each child has marked the pool with at least one gallon of pee (and the occasional 
floating Baby Ruth).Dear perfect friend,
He is friends-with-benefits zoning you! I have no idea why you would want to hear howgood of a friend you are when all your clothes are on the floor. He probably doesn’twant anything serious which is why he is limit -
ing your stay to one night per week. If youmust have sex with only him tell him you have 
a very demanding body. If he doesn’t
want to put in more hours banging, find some -
one new. You deserve someone who is
going to give it to you daily.Dear Mediocre Advice,
The guy I’m hooking up with keeps 
saying how he enjoys my friendship, but never talks to me outside of the one night I come over a week. Do you think he’s just saying whathe thinks I want to hear? And how do I tell him I need sex more than once a 
week?
Dear Friend,
Probably. I think the chances of this happen -
ing are higher if it’s dark and both parties are 
drunk. Why say no to a semi-OK looking girl 
who wants to bone you? The work you would 
have had to put in is done. She is eliminating the part during which you have to walk up to at least five chicks, look like an ass and be rejected while wasting at least $20 on drinks. At least one of those girls will lead you on and maybe give you a boner while you’re sitting down, which will take time out of moving to the next girl who may or may not be interested. It’s work. So if some girl is ready to go and a guy is 
willing, fornicating is the most likely result.JESSICA KEGU

brother’s buddy’s roommate is 
having a kegger, and you got a 
text invitation. Score.
You should believe most of 
what movies have taught you about house parties, and re-member that the respect you earn from a 30-second keg stand will be tarnished by the pity you receive from the best 
friend patiently stroking your 
back an hour later. Most im-portant, fruit punch is to grain alcohol as an invisibility cloak is to Harry Potter, so sip on that hunch punch slowly and cau-
tiously.
You paid $150 for a fake 
New Hampshire ID, and 
you’re ready to break it in.
Give it up now. That guy 
from Miami who promised it would scan, blacklight and pass a lie-detector test is probably ly-ing. Gainesville is not fake-ID-friendly , and, frankly , it’s just not worth it. If you are caught with a fake ID in Florida, it is 
a felony. If you are caught us-
ing somebody’s real ID, it is a misdemeanor charge. Both offenses include a hefty ﬁ  ne. 
The majority of the people who go out in Gainesville are college-
age and from 
Florida, not New Hamp-
shire, Arizona or Wisconsin, and the bouncers, though thick of body, are not thick of mind.
Girls’ nightThe ladies just called, and 
they have a bottle of Pinnacle waiting for you and a tip from a guy in their sociology class that this club in midtown is chill-as-you-know-what, and it’s free cover for girls until midnight. Basically , if your skirt is short and your heels are high, don’t be alarmed and appalled by the 
groping — and please don’t fall 
down.
The Frat PartyEveryone should go once, 
maybe twice. If you hit thrice, you should probably just rush.
Most important, try to re-
member that it gets easier. 
Plans will fall into place on 
their own, and you will ﬁ  nd 
your niche in Gainesville as 
long as you seek it. Sooner than you think, you’ll ﬁ  nd yourself watching bad TV with good friends on a Friday night, and it won’t feel lame — it will feel just right.The freshman’s

Victoria Miller combines sec-
ond-hand doilies and entrepre-
neurship to create a unique result. 
Miller, a 21-year-old art history se-nior at UF, makes dreamcatchers 
and sells them online at the popu-
lar handmade goods marketplace, 
Etsy.
Dreamcatchers originated from 
Native American tribes in the mid-
20th century. Many people believe 
a dreamcatcher will ﬁ  lter out evil 
spirits while they sleep when it is 
hung in a window or above their beds. Miller offers a modern, yet vintage twist to these traditional 
talismans.
“Most people think that I make 
the traditional Native American 
kind,” Miller said, “but mine are more vintage.”
Miller’s inspiration to start 
making dreamcatchers began on-line last winter break. She came across a blog on Fossil.com that featured a dreamcatcher with a 
crocheted doily in the center in-
stead of the usual webbing.
“It was kind of hard to under-
stand how to do it, so I just turned 
it into my own thing,” Miller said.
After getting doilies from her grandmother and thrift stores, Miller started making dreamcatch-ers. She tried different sizes, pat-terns and materials. After a while, she realized that she could not ﬁ  ll her whole house with dreamcatch-ers.
“I knew about Etsy and how it 
was all handmade and vintage, so I knew it was the perfect place to sell,” Miller said.
Opening the store was not as 
simple as she ﬁ  rst thought. She had to write store policies, ﬁ  g-ure out prices and pick shipping methods. She ﬁ  nally opened the store “REVIVE by Victoria” on May 23.
“I want-
ed the name to be some-thing to do with recy-cling — re-using old m a t e r i a l s and making 
them into something new,” Miller said.
Since she opened the store, 
Miller has sold about a dozen dreamcatchers, the largest dream-catcher selling for $65.
“I was surprised at how much 
someone will pay for a dream-catcher,” Miller said. “I try to be 
reasonable, thinking about what 
I would charge my friends versus strangers.”
Miller received what, to her, 
was the biggest compliment of all when she was invited to enter an art show during the Florida Surf-ing Championships in Jackson-ville, Fla.
“I was so excited. Someone had 
seen my stuff and thought it was good enough to show other peo-ple,” Miller said.With school, the about $150 
booth-rental cost and the time it would take to make enough dreamcatchers, Miller decided to not do the art show. However, she is looking into some local shows and markets at which she could present.  
Miller also sells United States 
rearview mirror decorations she makes from hangers that she twists into shape. She admittedly loves arts and crafts and said she always seems to be make things out of the unexpected.
“I recently brought home a box 
of my art stuff — just random ob-jects — but I know I am going to make something out of it,” Miller said.
Although Miller does not nec-
essarily believe in the power sup-posedly stored in dreamcatchers, she knows others believe in it or at least like their artistic value. It seems that popularity will contin-ue to drive Miller’s sales and pay her bills.10, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, AUGUST 30, 2012

1882: Gender-neutral historical 
figure Toni Labor sought to free the 
American worker from the shackles of the American work-week that, at its inception, continued for 365 days 
in a row. Tasks included, but were 
not limited to, beating rocks together and collecting goat and human sac-rifices as offerings to the evil dragon who oversaw production atop Mt. Drudgery . Americans refered to the dragon as “Grover.” Toni Labor suc-ceeded in slaying the dragon with a cardboard sign that read: “Seriously 
Grover, my feet are killing me,” and 
Americans celebrated by cooking the dragon over a fire. The Labor Day barbeque tradition was born.
1894: Labor Day became a federal 
holiday in honor of Toni Labor. When asked how he intended to spend the holiday , Toni replied: “I’m going to get drunk.” The getting drunk on 
Labor Day tradition is born.
1900: Dragon hunting became 
national Labor Day sport. Ameri-
cans invited friends and family to their homes to share the spoils of dragon meat. A feeling of commu-nity ensued.
1911: Deforestation and over-
hunting led to dragon extinction. 
“I don’t believe in Global Warm-ing,” 69-year-old Toni Labor said, “but hamburgers are still pretty 
good.” Skepticism of empirical facts 
about the environment is born (not restricted to solely Labor Day).
1914: The Labor family met a 
tragic end during a family camping trip, in what is believed to have been a dragon-free forest. One of the last known dragons appeared on the campsite and alternated between 
eating and breathing fire on the fam-
ily . A national funeral was hosted in honor of the Labors. Mourners wore white, not black, as “that’s the way Toni would have wanted it.”
1917: President Woodrow Wil-
son passed a law making it illegal to wear white after Labor Day . When asked to comment, Wilson famously replied, “I miss Toni Labor just as 
much as the next guy , but all these 
people keep wearing white clothes at the White House. Dude, come on. I’m going colorblind.”
1923: In honor of Toni Labor, 
workers everywhere took on the byname “laborer,” seeking to honor those who made their workplaces dragon-free.
1951: President Harry Truman 
legalized wearing white after labor day. He scanned the law quickly and assumed it was about ghosts.
1953: It became unfashionable 
for high society to wear white after Labor Day due to an effort to send a clear message to the ghosts: You are unwelcome in our homes. Popular 
belief stated ghosts invaded homes 
during winter because “they were cold.”
1955: After realizing ghosts aren’t 
real, wearing white after Labor Day was deemed unfashionable in an at-tempt to make clouds feel bad about themselves.
1956: After learning clouds were 
inanimate, people stopped wearing white after Labor Day because it’s freezing, and only an idiot wears re-flective colors during winter.
1970: Everything became super 
righteous. The ubiquity of psyche-delic drugs caused Americans to for -
get about the existence of dragons. Museums found bones, called them 
“Dinosaurs.”
Present Day: College students 
and Americans alike spend the day 
drinking beer and eating hotdogs. They have relatively no idea what’s going on. Happy Labor Day, every-body!

“My TV Guide didn’t come this month, so I don’t know what’s on TV right now.”  “I don’t believe in Global

Pushing the pianos aside and 
bringing out the microphone, 
Gainesville’s Rockeys Dueling Piano Bar is set to host comedy Wednes-days at 9 p.m. during September.
Rockeys, located at 112 S Main 
St., will showcase two professional comedians in addition to a local Gainesville comedian that hosts the show.
Comedy fans who are 18 and old-
er can enjoy the show for a $3 cover charge, an entertaining alternative to midtown bars and downtown clubs 
during the week.
“I’m excited for a different scene, 
away from the typical party nights,” 
said psychology senior Katie Edson. “My roommates and I wanted a place where we can talk and chill out during the week. So these comedy nights are definitely a nice change to everything else in town and allow 
us to have bonding time together.”
Audiences can enjoy quick-wit-
ted comedians Roy Haber, J.B. Ball, 
J. Bliss, Ken Garr, Rene Bray, Johnny Oz, Darryl Rhoades and Carmen Morales throughout September.
Rockeys hopes to keep the com-
edy nights going past September as long as people are willing to come 
out and watch, said Zach Givens, general manager of Rockeys.
“All of us here are huge stand-up 
comedy fans, and I feel like we put 
out some of the best touring com-ics out there,” Givens said. “I find myself having a hard time focusing on work sometimes, because these guys really know how to hold your attention.”
For people who missed the Au-
gust comedy night lineups, come-dian David Nickerson, from How-ard Stern’s Killers of Comedy Tour, and Florida comedian Chris Matson took the stage for the Aug. 22 show and interacted with the audience for many of their joke setups.
“Comedy is a release, so it’s defi-
nitely good to have college students come out and feed off the comedy ,” Matson said. “I started writing jokes in college, and I’ve somehow tran-scended that feel over the years for this type of demographic.”
For the older-than-21 crowd, at-
tendees can enjoy $4 Jameson, $3 wells and $2 domestic draft drink 
specials Wednesdays. Seating is on 
a first-come, first-served basis, so Rockeys recommends attendees ar -
rive early.
“If you want to go out with some 
friends, Rockeys is a great place to go out, have a good time and lift your spirits up,” Givens said. “We offer the best comedians out there that you can get for this kind of setting, so we hope no one misses out.”For more information on the 
weekly comedy nights, or to re-serve seating for large parties, call 352-505-0042 or visit rockeysduelingpianos.com.12, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, AUGUST 30, 2012

I could very easily play devil’s ad-
vocate when it comes to Nickelback 
and all of the unequivocal hatred sur -
rounding its members. However, after constantly hearing a particularly poi-gnant list of “reasons” for the band’s supposed amount of suck, I find myself 
more leveled with defending what is, 
without a doubt, one of the decade’s most successful acts.
Statistically, Nickelback accounts for 
a huge part of the successful music in the 2000s.  Based on Billboard chart suc-
cess, here are the facts:
•Ranked seventh top artist of the 
last decade
•More than 50 million albums sold 
worldwide
•“All the Right Reasons” was certi-
fied eight times platinum
•Nineteen Hot 100 singles
As for the many proclaiming that the 
band’s music is “unoriginal,” or that the band uses the same chord progres-sions (have you LISTENED to anything on Top 40 radio?), the exact same can 
be said about practically any artist on 
the Hot 100 today. Nickelback may not be in the same realm as Ke$ha or Usher, but all three have a major commonal-ity: They use a formula. A formula for success, which after all, has them on the charts for a reason. But a big difference between Nickelback and the other Top 40 artists is that the band has co-written 
or solely written every one of its songs, 
including each of its 19 hit singles. This is a feat the majority of today’s acts has not accomplished.
This repetitious style 
has kept acts on the top charts for ages. But the hatred toward Nick-elback can get out of 
hand and is borderline 
ridiculous. I mean, a petition to prevent the 
band from performing at the NFL half-time show on Thanksgiving 2011 in De-
troit? Again, this is not abnormal. But 
why waste time trashing a moderately acceptable act when there are legions more waiting for your well-deserved 
ridicule?
Admit it: Just about everyone has 
sung “Rockstar,”  “Photograph” or 
“How You Remind Me” without a care. The cool thing about Nickelback is that 
it is at least a bit likeable to most. I’m 
not saying it is everyone’s style, but it has made sing-along anthems that have stuck around. Sure, the band may be 
lackluster to many, but Nickelback set 
the proverbial stage for its contempo-raries in style and success.More listen, less livid: Why 
Nickelback is pretty decent

I liked Nickelback once.
In fact, I liked it enough to attend 
one of its concerts in seventh grade.
Then, just like the moment I dis-
covered I was actually delivered through my mother’s bajingo and not delivered by a majestic stork, 
I learned the world can be a dark 
place.
The concert consisted of Break-
ing Benjamin, Three Days Grace and Nickelback, certainly a trifecta from the eighth circle of Hell. A Jumbotron 
played a montage of women flashing 
their breasts in between each band, and I was drenched in beer from the 
gothic-redneck audience surround-
ing me after the first half hour.
By the time Nickelback came out, 
lead singer Chad Kroeger was less of a 13-year-old crush and more of 
a Nicolas Cage look-alike whose 
“gravelly” voice could be mistaken for his “I’m taking a massive crap” voice.
This was my transition from fan 
to hater. This is when I realized that a band cannot possibly be good if the lyrics, “If they could love like you and me/Imagine what the world could be,” and, “No doubt that we were heading south/I guess nobody ever taught her not to speak with a full mouth,” could be in songs on the same album.
Look Nickelback, I’m all about 
going “all in, balls out,” as you sing in “Burn It To The Ground,” but zip up your pants and leave something to the imagination.  
Let’s take a look at Nos. 1, 2 and 
3 in a list of the top 10 Nickelback songs from voices.yahoo.com for an idea of the band’s inconsistency.
No 3 is “Photograph,” an exam-
ple of the Nickelback that’s drip-ping with fake love and poignancy. “Rockstar” takes second, with its alcoholic, pro-drug, disrespect-to-
women lyrics.
The No. 1 spot 
goes to “How You 
Remind Me,” which 
actually has some 
depth and authen-ticity. It was also released in 2001. If your No. 1 song is 
from 11 years ago, it’s time to stop.   
So please, Chad, go marry Avril 
Lavigne, star in a reality TV show about sellout pop couples, or maybe 
start a family of Ramen-haired chil-
dren. I don’t care. Just stop making my ears bleed.Nickelback: The most 
hated band for a reason

We’re hiring! Come out to 1105 W. University Ave. for our Open House today from 2 p.m. to 4:30 p.m.  �UF RANKED NO. 8 IN NCAA IN TOTAL DEFENSE LAST SEASON. 
  ADAM PINCUS
 Alligator Staff Writer
   Coaches expect a Florida defense 
that ranked eighth in the country in 
2011 to be even better this fall. 
  After a lack of depth forced Shar-
rif Floyd to play defensive end last season, the 6-foot-3, 303-pound ju-nior moved back to his natural posi-
tion — defensive tackle. 
  Floyd will team up with defen-
sive tackle Omar Hunter in 2012. 
At a combined 616 pounds, the duo is expected to free space for the UF 
linebackers.
  “You see more leg strength from 
him,” defensive coordinator Dan 
Quinn said of Hunter. “You see a 
stronger man when he sheds blocks. 
To me the work ethic from Omar has always been there. He’s a hard work-er. Every day in and out and then now you’re kind of seeing a more 
strong and powerful man inside and 
that’s showing up in practice by the way he can take on blocks and get off blocks.” 
  Floyd, Hunter and junior defen-
sive end Dominique Easley com-bined for 16.5 tackles for a loss last season but have been paving the way for UF’s linebackers in practice.
  “We’ve been getting a lot of pen-
etration,” starting Buck linebacker Lerentee McCray said. “One of them 
has to get a double team, they can’t 
just single block everybody. So it’s deﬁ  nitely helping the linebackers with guards trying to get to the sec-
ond level. ... It’s deﬁ  nitely helping 
the linebackers out a lot.”
  After Ronald Powell suffered an 
ACL tear in the spring game, Mc-Cray, a redshirt senior, stepped into 
the Buck linebacker position. 
  Although coaches are asking him 
to ﬁ  ll the shoes of last season’s sacks 
leader, McCray doesn’t expect a drop 
off from UF’s 28-sack performance, 
which ranked No. 38 nationally last season.
  “I feel like we are going to be the 
same thing,” he said. “We got a lot 
of guys able to get after the quarter-
back. Our pass rush has gotten better since camp.”
  A group of newcomers will back 
up Easley, Floyd and Hunter on the line. Freshmen  Dante Fowler Jr. and Jonathan Bullard are the second-string ends, while JUCO transfer  Damien Jacobs is the primary backup 
at defensive tackle.
  “We got a lot of young guys com-
ing in,” McCray said. “We are fresh THURSDAY, AUGUST 30, 2012

  The kickoff to the 2012 sea-
son is only three days away , but 
coach Will Muschamp is still mum on the identity of Flori-
da’s starting quarterback. 
  Jacoby Brissett and Jeff 
Driskel will each play a quarter 
on Saturday, although Mus-champ hasn’t announced who will take the season’s ﬁ  rst snap.  
  “I have not made that deci-
sion at this time,” Muschamp 
said Wednesday . “Both guys 
deserve the right to start, de-serve the right to play.”
  Muschamp said that 
Wednesday’s and today’s prac-
tices would be a part of the 
evaluation process. Rather than make the decision just prior to kickoff, Muschamp plans to give the starter enough notice to mentally prepare. 
  “We’ll give them some 
time,” Muschamp said. “We’re going to give them both a 
quarter to see how we sort this 
thing out, and we’ll move from there.”  
Position switches: Coaches 
are evaluating freshman Jafar Mann at guard, defensive co-ordinator Dan Quinn said on Monday. 
  Mann came to UF as a three-
star defensive tackle, but Flori-da’s coaches saw potential for Still no starter at QB JURNY DUTY
  Anyone who is expect-
ing big things from the Gators this season is ei-
ther falling victim to blind opti-mism or foolishly taking the team at its word.
  At quarterback, many expect 
the winner of the battle between Jacoby Brissett and Jeff Driskel to take signiﬁ  cant steps forward from last season, when both struggled. 
  They played only a limited 
number of snaps in 2011 and have had to learn a whole new offense since the season ended. 
We haven’t been able to watch 
practices, so how can we be sure that the reason the competition between the two is so close is be-cause they have both played so well, not because they have both 
played poorly? Because that is 
what they tell us? That is hardly convincing.  Even if 
you want to believe that the winner of the start-
ing quar-
t e r b a c k job will be 
OK, it is laughable to expect big-
time production from either op-
tion given the weapons around them. 
  While the quarterbacks have a 
relatively clean slate because they 
saw limited playing time in 2011, 
the wide receiving corps that struggled as much as any unit on the team last year remains largely 
the same. 
  The Gators’ four returning 
wideouts with receptions are 
Frankie Hammond Jr., Quinton Dunbar, Solomon Patton and An-
dre Debose. That group combined to catch 48 passes for 864 yards 
and six touchdowns in 2011.
  Sixty wide receivers in the 
NCAA last year had more receiv-ing yards than that group, more than 100 receivers had more re-ceptions and 88 caught more 
touchdowns.
  Debose led all of the return-
ing wideouts with 16 receptions 
last year. That total would have made him a top-four pass catcher 
on just one other Southeastern 
Conference team — LSU.
  Some think the formula for the 
UF offense this season is simple: 
Run the ball and don’t ask the 
quarterbacks to do too much.
  But the running backs haven’t 
accomplished enough to prove they can hold up their half of that equation. Mike Gillislee’s 5.9 
yards-per-carry average is nice, 
but very little of his production UF air attack will struggle in 2012

  Bullard and Fowler, who came to UF as 
ﬁ  ve-star recruits, received praise from coach Will Muschamp during camp. Bullard has been working at defensive end, while Fowl-
er has been working at Buck linebacker.
  “It helps a lot being able to rotate two people at a position,” McCray said. “We can 
rotate series.”
  While players labored through the grind 
of training camp, at least one enjoyed taking repetitions at a familiar spot.
  “It feels like winning the lottery,” Floyd 
said about moving to defensive tackle. “I mean I love what I do. I love what I can do for the team.”

D-LINE  from page 17Floyd happy to be back at tackleUF mulling two-way options
him to play both sides of the ball, as he 
did in high school. 
  “We wanted to put him over at offen-
sive line for a couple weeks and get the 
evaluation there,” Quinn said. “We took 
our time looking at him on defense. We’re 
going to do the same thing on offense. Af-ter this week or next, we’ll make a ﬁ  nal determination.”
  Quinn said the Gators are also ﬂ  irt-
ing with the idea of using defensive back Jabari Gorman on both offense and 
defense. Gorman is listed as the second-
string free safety on UF’s depth chart. He also played wideout in high school. 
  Valdez Showers, the second-string 
strong safety, impressed coaches in his 
time at running back on the scout team, 
but Quinn “fought for him to stay at safe-ty.”
  “He’s really settled in at safety ,” 
Quinn said. “We are counting on him to 
do that.”
  Quinn said the roster was otherwise 
settled and no further positional switches 
are planned barring injury situations.  
  Pittman progressing: In spring, football 
was easier for Latroy Pittman. 
  Sure, the freshman had to learn a new 
playbook for a new team, but the coaches kept it simple. 
A  s the calendar turned to fall, the 
coaches began to ask 
more of him, and, like 
most freshmen, he hit 
a wall.
  “At the end of train-
ing camp, he might 
have hit that a little 
bit,” Muschamp said. 
“He’s come back 
through it, and we’ve narrowed some things down as we continue to game plan 
through this week.” 
  Pittman was a four-star prospect who 
enrolled early and shined in Florida’s 
spring game, hauling in catches of 8 and 43 yards. Given Florida’s struggles at the wide receiver position in 2011, the team hopes Pittman can provide a boost. 
  “[We’re] excited about his progress,” 
Muschamp said.  
  Contact Greg Luca at gluca@alligator.org. NOTES , from page 17
came in meaningful situations. His backups 
have accomplished even less.
  To assume the Gators can win by leaning on 
the run game is misguided. They have to get something out of their wide receivers, but the wideouts on the roster have nothing to offer.
  Maybe a freshman skill position player 
steps up, perhaps Kent Taylor or Latroy Pitt-man.  But relying on freshmen is risky.The last freshman to catch 20 passes for the 
Gators was Trey Burton in 2010, and he aver-aged just 6.6 yards per catch. 
A freshman wide receiver hasn’t caught 20 
passes for Florida since Percy Harvin caught 34 in 2006.
  The defense will be as dominant as every-
one expects, but unless the Gators ﬁ  nd an un-
expected source of offense, banking on more 
than seven wins is simply unrealistic.

KATIE AGOSTIN

Although she had already won 
five Southeastern Conference titles, 
an NCAA title and a world title, ju-nior Elizabeth Beisel was shocked when she won two Olympic medals 
in London.
“It definitely was a surprise; I 
wasn’t really expecting to get two,” 
Beisel said. “Coming out of London and coming home with two is so cool. It was really like a dream come true.”
The nine time All-American won 
a bronze medal in the 200-meter 
backstroke and a silver in the 400 in-
dividual medley , an event in which she was skeptical of even making the semifinals.
Beisel made her first Olympic ap-
pearance when she was just 15 years old, as the youngest member of Team USA in the 2008 Beijing Olym-pics. There she finished fourth in the 
400 IM and fifth in the 200 back.
In addition to medaling in 2012, 
another difference between the two 
Olympics for Beisel was having Florida coach Gregg Troy on hand. 
Troy coached the U.S. men’s 
team in London.
“He’s one of my favorite people 
in the entire world, so to have him 
in London with me really made me 
comfortable with the situation I was in,” Beisel said. “Four years ago, I didn’t have my personal coach with me, so it was coach Troy who took me under his wing. So for me to ac-tually have him there again this time around was really nice.”
Beisel credited her Olympic suc-
cess to her experience from the trials, where she swam a lengthy program 
consisting of nine total events.
“It’s a very tolling meet just emo-
tionally and physically; emotionally 
even more so just because there is so much pressure you put on yourself and you have from other people to try to make the team,” Beisel said. “It was hard, but it definitely paid off in the long run. It was such an 
easier meet in London because of 
what I did in Omaha.” 
Beisel added that having her 
teammates with her during the tri-als and in London helped her re-main calm, which is something she’s been learning to do since becoming a Gator in 2010.
Even Troy noticed a difference in 
her mentality this summer. 
“She’s always had a little bit of 
trouble handling some of the pres-sure,” Troy said. “She gets real ner -
vous in her desire to do well, and it’s kind of held her back. She went into the trials this time and handled it entirely differently. She was very relaxed going into the meet.”
Now that the Olympics are over, Beisel hopes to use her experiences from London to help her excel as the Gators’ captain this season.  
“It’s different types of pressure between the NCAA and the Olym-pics,” Beisel said. “The Olympics is much more individual with winning a medal for yourself, but NCAA is winning points for the team. It’ll help me deal with being able to win for myself, but also translate that over to winning for the team.”

Gators midfielder Erika Tym-
rak has a knack for clutch plays.
In more than three years at 
Florida, the 2011 NSCAA second-
team All-American has seven game-winning goals. Last year, she scored the tying goal and as-
sisted on the game-winning goal 
in the Southeastern Conference 
To u r n a m e n t semifinal.
Tymrak  
picked up sev-
eral awards this week after pro-viding Florida with the most im-portant goal of the young season 
in Sunday’s 3-2 win over Duke. 
She was named SEC Offensive 
Soccer Player of the Week, Soc-
cer America Player of the Week, 
CollegeSoccer360.com Prime-
time Player and Disney Soccer/NSCAA Player of the Week. 
The last Gator to win NSCAA 
Player of the Week was senior McKenzie Barney, who received the honor in 2010 after scoring a game-winning goal against Flor -
ida State.
“It feels awesome,” Tymrak 
said about the SEC award. “I’m just happy that we could get such a good weekend. … The fact that I got the honor on top of that is 
just incredible.” 
Tymrak was recognized for 
her offensive production in 
Florida’s upset of Duke. Tymrak scored the game-winning goal in the 93rd minute of the Gators’ 
second straight overtime match, 
finishing a give-and-go from Bar -
ney inside the box.
“When it went in, I kind of 
turned and looked at [Barney] and she started screaming, and it hit me that we just won,” Tymrak said.
She also set up Florida’s sec-
ond goal of the match when her 
cross into the box deflected off a 
Duke defender for an own goal.
Tymrak said the game-winner 
stands as the greatest goal she has scored for UF. In a career filled with clutch goals, that is no easy decision.
As a sophomore in 2010, Tym-
rak registered both of the Gators’ goals in a 2-1 overtime victory against Georgia. 
In a 2011 match against Texas 
Tech, she scored two goals and assisted on a third in the Gators’ 3-0 win.
She was named SEC Offen-
sive Player of the Week after both matches.
“She likes to do the spec-
tacular,” coach Becky Burleigh said. “She likes to entertain the crowd.”
This season, Tymrak has cer -
tainly done that, even when she hasn’t scored.
Halfway through the second 
overtime against North Carolina, Tymrak received a pass on Flori-da’s side of the field, outran one 
Tar Heel and dribbled past three 
more to create an opportunity in-side the penalty box.
Tymrak was pulled down as 
she took the shot and the ball 
deflected off a defender, but the 
preceding run and maneuvering demonstrated Tymrak’s explo-siveness and playmaking ability.
“What you do notice is her flair 
and creativity,” Burleigh said. 
In addition to creating plays 
and scoring on her own, she also has one of Florida’s three assists 
this season, setting up Claire 
Falknor’s goal against Miami on Aug. 17.
“What she’s really, really put 
a lot of work into is being more disciplined and trying to be more 
organized,” Burleigh said. 
“That’s not in her normal per -
sonality, so to do that is a big 
sacrifice that she’s making and 
I think it’s really paying off for 
us.”THURSDAY, AUGUST 30, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 19
