two to hospital

Two people, including a preg-
nant woman, plummeted 15 feet
on Thursday when the landing in
front of their unit in Lyons Apart-
ments gave way.
Both were transported to
Shands at UF, where they are in
stable condition, according to
Carol Davis, Gainesville Fire Res-
cue spokeswoman.
Three other people were re-
moved via a fire truck ladder from
building 1810 because the broken
landing made it hazardous for
them to leave their apartments.
"There was a complaint about
the railing on that staircase not
less than one month ago," said
property manager Spring Sta-
ples.
The railing was fixed, how-ever the stairwell and the balcony
above were not identified as a
problem, according to Staples.
Building and fire inspector
Jerry Coughlin said no one is
allowed on the second floor of
building 1810 until everything is
replaced.
"Whether or not the other
buildings are safe. .that's the
question," he said.
Resident Natasha Arbaczaus-
kas said she has never felt safe
in the Lyons. She can point out
mold, water damage, wood rot
and crumbling Formica.
In order to fix the mold issue,
she was told she would need to
sign a new lease.
She also said the leasing office
took six months to fix a leaky fau-
cet.
Staples said the building is
routinely checked up on, and the
last check was about a year ago.
UF ACADEMICS
Law school goes virtual
By EMILY FUGGETTA

Michelle Jacobs is only a few inches tall
during third and fourth period Thursdays -
unless you zoom in on her.
Jacobs, a professor in UF's Levin College
of Law, teaches Crime in the Virtual Context
using Second Life, a computer simulation
program that allows users to create comput-
er versions of themselves and interact with
each other in a virtual classroom.
Jacobs said she already had her own Sec-
ond Life persona when she discovered stu-
dent-created Gator Nation Island and was
both hesitant and excited to become involved
with it on an academic level.
"With any new technology you risk mas-
sive failure when you are an early adopter
but the possible benefits were intriguing to
me," she said. "I'll confess I was surprisedto learn that people at UF were advanced
enough to consider it."
Gator Nation Island's designer and archi-
tect, Joshua Javaheri, originally built the is-
land for his senior project in UF's digital arts
and sciences program.
Javaheri said the tough-
est part of designing the
virtual space was finding a
balance between maintain-
ing the appearance of UF's
Levin College of Law and
the surrounding areas and
Jab making it easily recogniz-
able by the students in the
class.
He worked with UF's Digital Worlds In-
stitute and the law school to create the virtual
campus, and Javaheri said he worked hard to
meet both of their expectations.

Section editors from the nation's

"Patience is important because somany people come," Bjornsen said.
"It's not possible to have story ideas for

Campaign encourages Gators to use buses, bicycles
By CAROLYN TILLO
Alligator Writer
For the second year in a row,
UF students, faculty and staff
are choosing not to drive them-
selves crazy while getting around
Gainesville.
Registration for the second
annual One Less Car Challenge,
which promotes saving the envi-
ronment by finding alternatives to
driving, began Monday and will
last until Nov. 20.
Stephanie Sims, the implemen-tation plan coordinator for the Of-
fice of Sustainability, said some
of the alternatives the challenge
highlights include cycling, public
transportation from the Regional
Transit System and Zipcar, a hy-
brid-car rental service.
Sims said this year the challenge
is also using GreenRide, a carpool-
coordinating software program, to
give people the option of carpool-
ing to and from campus. Students
will be able to register for Green-
Ride though the Office of Sustain-
ability's Web site and find carpool
partners in their area."I feel like it would just be
good for people to try some
different ways of getting to
campus."
Andrea Grossman
UFjunior
She said the software also re-
cords each participant's alterna-
tive commutes and keeps track of
the points they earn throughout
the challenge.
Teams and their members re-ceive points for using alterna-
tive transportation and referring
friends to the challenge, Sims said.
Anna Prizzia, the director of the
Office of Sustainability, said she
rides her bike to work each day to
avoid searching for parking and to
get fresh air.
"Being the director of the Office
of Sustainability, I find it very im-
portant to walk the talk and lead
by example," she said.
Andrea Grossman, a junior
environmental science major and
intern at the office, said she also
bikes to campus from her apart-ment.
Grossman said biking helps her
get to campus faster.
"I feel like it would just be
good for people to try some dif-
ferent ways of getting to campus
because they might find some-
thing that is more convenient for
them and that also helps out the
environment,"she said.
To showcase these different
forms of commuting, the challenge
will host an Alternative Transpor-
tation Fair Tuesday from 9 a.m. to
2 p.m. on the Reitz Union North
Lawn.
60K Fla. residents anticipated to contract HINI virus
Students with flu symptoms asked to stay at home
By MEREDITH RUTLAND
Alligator Contributing Writer
This fall, students may have more to
prepare for than just exams.
It is expected that about 60,000 Florid-
ians will contract the swine flu this flu sea-
son, according to Dr. Phillip Barkley, direc-
tor of student health at UF.
"Right now, all the cases of influenza in
the U.S. are HINI," he said.
Swine flu, also known as the HINI vi-rus, has become the sole influenza virus this
flu season. The Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention estimates the U.S. has had
more than one million cases, Barkley said,
adding those in the high-risk category in-
clude students under the age of 24.
However, Barkley said this is no cause
for chaos.
"Certainly the biggest difference with
this particular flu is there is no particular
human immunity," he said. "The good
thing is the severity of the disease is on themild side."
Barkley said UF students who had cases
of HINI were treated over the summer,
adding many students are able to take care
of themselves.
Local Barkley said the StudentNews Health Care Center antici-
pates more cases this year and
that vaccines will be available on campus.
However, he was unable to specify an exact
release date.
According to UF's environmental healthand safety Web site, symptoms include fe-
ver, cough, sore throat, runny nose, body
aches, headaches, chills, fatigue, diarrhea
and vomiting.
Treatment is as simple as bed rest, fluids
and Tylenol, according to the site.
Barkley said students are highly advised
not to go to class if they are sick.
"Don't affect other people," Barkley
said. "Do others a favor."
For those students who do find them-
selves with flu-like symptoms, a treatment
page can be found on the campus environ-
mental health and safety Web site at www.
ehs.ufl.edu/hlnl/.

Gainesville is not the least bit chilly, but UF
just got a little cooler.
Sierra Club Magazine recently ranked the
school at No. 15 on its third annual Cool School
list, earning UF an A for its eco-friendly efforts.
The club bases its school rankings on eight
factors, including energy, efficiency, transpor-
tation and waste.
"Sustainability is one of our priorities here.
It's clearly important to students," said UF
spokesman Steve Orlando, adding that envi-
ronmental programs, including Zipcar and
buying locally grown produce for dining halls,
are campus-wide efforts.
"Every new generation places the environ-
ment as a higher priority," he said. "You really
can't lose with that."
The University of Colorado at Boulder,
which ranked No. 1, earned 10 out of 10 points
for transportation. UF received eight points for
transportation, according to the list.
"I think UF is an environmentally friendly
school because of all the seemingly small pro-
grams that are implemented right on campus,"Gator fan."'
"I love that taking the bus and leaving my car
at home saves me gas money, parking hassles
and is good for the environment," she added.
Other high-ranking schools
include Harvard University
and Yale University, which
placed 11th and 14th, respec-
/ tively.
According to the Web site,
if two or more schools tie for a
spot, the club considers other
Orlando factors such as consistency
across categories.
While the University of Central Florida
stands at the No. 57 spot with a C-plus, other
Florida schools such as Florida State University
and the University of Miami did not make the
cut.
The Sierra Club is the oldest, largest and
most influential grassroots environmental or-
ganization in the U.S., according to its Web site.
The group works to protect communities, wild
places and the planet.tihe lop)5 mos

UF to hire up to 100 new faculty
By THOMAS STEWART
Alligator Staff Writer
tstewart@alligator org
Just over a week after UF sent
notices to many of the 60 employ-
ees being laid off, UF President Ber-
nie Machen announced an initia-
tive to use $10 million in stimulus
money to hire up to 100 new faculty
this year.
Machen made the announce-
ment Thursday during his State of
the University speech to the Faculty
Senate.
"The areas that are gonna be hir-
ing new faculty are high-demand,
based upon student interest," Ma-
chen said after his speech. "The
areas that have layoffs are areas
where the colleges decided they
don't have high demand."
"We have a responsibility to
you to allow you (students) to take
classes so you can graduate," he
said.
But John Biro, president of UF's
chapter of the United Faculty of
Florida, the faculty union, said the
plan is unfair to faculty being laid
off.
"It's absolutely unconscionable
to have a policy where you're trad-
ing in proven and loyal and suc-
cessful faculty," he said. "It's like
trading in your used car."
Biro said the plan is proof that
Machen is using budget cuts to
change the face of the university
without properly vetting it with the
university community.
"It's a few people's ideas of what
should happen without bringingeveryone else on board," he said.
He said faculty morale is low-
er than he's ever seen it and that
moves like this discourage the best
faculty from seeking jobs at UF.
"Who will want to come here?"
Biro asked.
Of the 60 employees being laid
off this year, 11 are faculty. And
since last August, UF has lost a net
of 81 faculty members, a decline of
2.1 percent. In the last two years,
Machen said, UF has lost 5 percent
of its faculty.
Machen said the new faculty will
be hired this fis-
cal year and will
start in July, the
beginning of the
next fiscal year.
For the first
year, their sala-
ries will be paid
Machen y stimulus
money, and in
the second year, differential tuition
money will pick up their salaries on
a permanent basis.
The number of faculty hired will
depend on the mix of junior and
senior faculty, Machen said, but it
could mean up to 100 new hires.
He said it will also help reduce
the faculty-student ratio, which is
just more than 20-to-1.
"We're still the lowest in the
state of Florida," he said, "but if
you look at our peers around the
country, our faculty-student ratio is
too stretched out."
UF's plan to reduce enrollment
by 4,000 will also help that goal.
UF's enrollment is now at 49,600,compared to 52,112 last fall.
Machen said really good schools
have a faculty-student ratio of 15-
to-1, but said UF will never be able
to reach that.
Reacting to the recent news that
UCF's enrollment topped UF's at
the start of classes, Machen said,
"Good for them."
"We're not concerned with
size," he said, "we're concerned
with quality."
Machen also announced that
research awards were up 2 percent
this year to $574 million, after fall-
ing from $635 million to $562 mil-
lion last year.
By comparison, UF took in $339
million in research awards in 1999-
2000.
Machen reported that student
parking decal sales were down 9
percent. This decrease comes as UF
is creating new parking spaces, with
a 927-space parking garage on the
corner of Gale Lemerand Drive and
Mowry Road that opened Monday.
After Machen's speech, the Sen-
ate was briefed on the swine flu
pandemic.
"Right now, the severity is a
two on a five-point scale," said Phil
Barkley, director of UF's Student
Health Care Center. Barkley asked
faculty to take it easy on students
who get sick because UF has re-
quested that students with flu-like
symptoms stay home and isolate
themselves until 24 hours after their
fevers have disappeared.
"Please be flexible with students
this fall when it comes to making
up work," Barkley said.Bernnke f?.gnim

We're sorry to have sent you into a bout of post-trau-
matic stress over the conspicuous absence of the Grey Lady
on campus, but fret no more. Student Government is in the
process of reinstating The New York Times readership pro-
gram and should have the paper back in those blue boxes
on Monday. For listening to the outpouring of distraught
paperless students and working to help us get our news on
once more, the Department of Darts & Laurels would like to
send an if-only-you-could-make-those-boxes-possible-to-
open-we'd-be-golden LAUREL to SG Treasurer Maryam
Laguna. Some of us only know what day of the week it is
based on whose column is running in the Times, so your
efforts will not go unnoticed.
Something else that didn't go unnoticed, apparently,
is the fight that broke out in front of Club Decadence on
Wednesday morning. As two women broke into a straight-
up brawl, a crowd of about 50 people gathered to watch.
Sometimes fights are cool -if you've ever seen someone
confront an always-late RTS bus driver, you know this.
Fights involving violence are not, however. For standing
around and watching like gladiatorial gawkers, we would
like to send a DART to the crowd that did nothing to stop
the fight. While we're at it, we might as well throw a half-
LAUREL to the two women for taking it outside (because
God knows that if people started throwing 'bows inside
that shoebox, nine people would have been killed). Unless,
of course, the place is bigger on the inside than on the out-
side a la "House of Leaves." Who are we kidding? If Club
Decadence ever posed any sort of metaphysical question to
anyone, we would die of the shock.
To anyone who has ever bemoaned the fact that Ameri-
can Apparel manages to sell $20 T-shirts that consist of ap-
proximately two ounces of fabric, you're about to have some
more fodder for your proverbial cannon. Currently being
sold in AA stores is something called Bag-O-Scraps, which
is exactly what it sounds like. For a nominal fee of $8, you,
too, can own scraps from the floor of an actual American
Apparel factory. For pushing their we-sell-you-$3-shirts-at-
a-9,000-percent-price-markup credo to a whole new level,
we'd like to throw a not-even-the-late-Billy-Mays-could-
sell-us-this-one DART at American Apparel. We could
possibly relent on 'em, considering they are throwing in a
'zine with the box, but we realized that if you're buying gar-
bage, you probably don't have the requisite brain power to
make it through four to five pages of reading material.
Those of you who are lamenting the death of the Bright
Futures book stipend may be getting a break yet again. We
would like to throw a thanks-for-saving-us-when-Florida-
almost-made-us-pay-for-some-of-our-college-experience
LAUREL to a new Web site called textbookaid.org that
will help students get a tax break. All documented, out-of-
pocket, college-related expenses can be reported for up to a
$2,500 tax break. We're starting to regret forgoing the bag
(and the receipt) at Goerings Book Store. So much for being
environmentally conscious.
That's all for this week. See you Monday morning.

Alligator headline misleading
What incredible happy news I first thought
from reading the Alligator headlines on Aug.
27: "Machen: No more cuts." On the Web site
version, I found a less misleading headline
for the story: "Machen predicts end to bud-
get cuts." The "end" of budget cuts will hap-
pen after we have "more" budget cuts. I liked
the positive quotes from Machen: "economy
seems to be stabilized," "gonna be a positive
year after a 'negative year."' All preceded by
he's "ready to predict there will be no more
cuts to UF's budget next spring."
The skeptic is prepared. The story goes
on to say the president intends to hire more
faculty through stimulus money (applause)
so as to curb the "brain drain." I thought the
brain drain was happening due to low salaries
but there seems to be no mention on how to
raise salaries to deflect the "brain drain." The
hope is to have money for new hires, but no
money for higher salaries? I read nothing on
the non-continuation of contracts in Academic
Technology. So we can look forward to more
"cuts" in November. Machen is quoted as say-
ing, "What we're anxious to do is get back
into a hiring mode." If UF wants to hire more
people, it better "cut" them so you can make
room to hire more. Maybe a more appropriate
Alligator headline could have been: "Machen
predicts end to budget cuts [by next spring af-
ter a painful winter]."

New York Times program to be re-instated
After hearing many people voice their con-
cerns over the possible funding decreases fromour Collegiate Readership Program, I want to
take this opportunity to set the record straight
on a few things and hopefully assuage some
of your fears.
Over the last few years, The New York
Times has suffered from a steady decline of
readership that has affected their bottom line.
In turn, their rates have gone up as they try to
survive this dark period for print media. Thus
we have been working with them to be able to
continue to provide the best services for our
student and apologize for the momentary gap
in delivery. We are expecting delivery to re-
sume this coming Monday.
We at Student Government recognize the
importance of The New York Times as an in-
valuable service to the Student Body for im-
portant information and promise to work dili-
gently to ensure that the Grey Lady and other
respected papers remain available on campus.
One way everyone can help is by decreasing
our reliance on the unsustainable paper edi-
tion and using the online edition of the Times
that is free for anyone who wishes to read it.
Thank you all for voicing your concerns
and engaging your elected officials. I hope we
can all unite to work together toward solving
problems like this in the future.

New cart service offers free rides around Gainesville
By KATHRYN STOLARZ
Alligator Contributing Writer
Zipping around on doorless
six-seat carts may soon become the
most convenient and environmen-
tally friendly way to move -and
it's free.
ZIPcarts, a new Gainesville
transportation service launching
Sept. 5, shuttles people within
the perimeter of 16th Avenue, the
southernmost edge of UF's cam-
pus, Southeast Seventh Street and
34th Street.
Since the beginning of the test-
ing phase on Aug. 17, about 1,000
students have gotten rides on two
green and yellow carts, according
to Jordan Long, 21, Santa Fe Col-
lege business management junior
and one of three company found-
ers.
When five dolled-up girls
flagged down a cart Sunday eve-
ning to catch a ride, their reaction
was immediate excitement.
"This is going to be one of my
favorites."
"Give me the number. I'm put-
ting it in my phone right now."
"Oh my god. This is awesome."
According to Long, their reac-
tion is common.
"So far, everyone loves it," he
said. "They're just amazed that
there is a free service that is so con-
venient."
Sophomore Kelsey Bryant
waved down a ZIPcart driving by
in her neighborhood at about 11:30
p.m. Monday and got a ride to a
Sigma Chi house party. She called
the service heaven-sent.
She usually walks when she
goes out at night, she said.
"I don't understand the (RTS)
routes real well at night," she said.
"SNAP sucks. SNAP takes forever.
You get scared waiting."
The university has also re-sponded positively to the idea of
the service.
"Anything that's going to pro-
vide alternative transportation to
someone under the influence of
alcohol is a great idea," said UPD
spokesman Jeff Holcomb.
But safety and convenience
aren't ZIPcarts' only perks -the
ZIP stands for Zero-emission In-
town People movers. The electric
carts, which are street legal on
roads up to 35 mph, run on electric-
ity, so they don't emit greenhouse
gases. They cost about $1 per day
or between 1 and 2 cents per mile
to run, according to cofounder
Majid Vasigh, a UF alumnus and
criminal lawyer.
The company will transport agroup of county commissioners
from around the state from the
Gainesville Hampton Inn to a con-
ference at Santa Fe College around
8 a.m. today to showcase ZIPcarts
as an example of the county's sus-
tainability efforts.
The idea for the company was
sparked last year when former
Tampa neighbors Ryan Clarke,
cofounder, and Vasigh were rid-
ing on Hop Tampa, downtown
Tampa's free, eco-friendly shuttle
service.
"We joked about how cool
it would be to start one of these
things and do it right and do it bet-
ter," Vasigh said.
This July, they decided to make
it happen.While vacationing in Cancun,
Mexico, Clarke discussed the idea
with Long, Clarke's friend since
high school, and they agreed to
start the company. Vasigh hopped
on board, and the three devoted
their summer nights and week-
ends to developing and planning.
"We were really serious about
it," Clarke said.
"Where better to do it than in
a college town where the kids are
getting drunk and walking or driv-
ing home, and where there are lots
of muggings and [robberies]?"
He said the goal of ZIPcarts is
trifold -to keep drunk drivers
off the roads, reduce greenhouse
gas emissions and profit by selling
advertisements, which will appear
iviaui iripp~ /iiigaor Mian
Ryan Clarke, a creator of ZiPcarts, poses next to one his carts while on the job Thursday night. ZlPcarts
is a free, green service that takes passengers all over inner Gainesville and runs until the bars close.on the sides of the carts and water
bottles given to customers.
The three presented their idea
to Gainesville's Public Safety and
Towing Subcommittee later that
month.
"The consensus was a great
thumbs up," Vasigh said.
Clarke, Vasigh and Long front-
ed more than $75,000 in startup
costs, including six carts -the two
currently operating and four more
on order -license plates, T-shirts,
business cards and taxi lights for
the roofs, but Long said the ven-
ture is more than worth the trouble
and cost.
Rain skirts, plastic sheets that
drape over the sides of the carts,
should be delivered within a
couple of weeks so the rides can
be given rain or shine, Long said.
The company is also looking into
ordering 11-seat carts to transport
larger groups.
The company is also creating an
iPhone application and a mobile
Web site package for the Blackber-
ry. They will also install GPS loca-
tors on each cart sometime within
the next month to serve those who
can't explain where they are be-
yond an address, Vasigh said.
Long plans to have at least six to
eight carts running in Gainesville
by the end of the year. After estab-
lishing a firm base in Gainesville,
he hopes to expand the company
to colleges across Florida and
Georgia and eventually franchise
the company throughout the na-
tion.
"I want to do all kinds of stuff,"
Long said. "This is just a stepping
stone."

NATIONAL
Tax credit may give up to $2.5K to those without aid
By JESSICA CHAPMAN
Alligator Writer
Long lines, pricey books and empty
shelves are often the norm for students dur-
ing the first week of classes.
But now some students might get paid to
go through the hassle.
College students and families who do not
receive financial aid, scholarships or grants
might qualify for the American Opportunity
Tax Credit, part of the American Recovery
and Reinvestment Act passed in February by
the U.S. Congress.
The credit will give students up to $2,500
for their out-of-pocket expenses, focusing on
textbooks.
The tax credit is only available through the
2009 and 2010 tax years and is an extension of
the Hope Credit, which was designed to help
offset education costs, according to a release
by the National Association of College Stores,
which partnered with the IRS to raise aware-
ness.
Although the Hope Credit was custom-
ized for students who come from lower in-
come families, the American OpportunityTax Credit will include a broader range of
taxpayers.
"It really is a great opportunity to fill in
some holes [from out-of-pocket expenses],"
said Richard Hershman, director of govern-
ment relations for the National Association
of College Stores. "It's a win for students and
families. There's no reason not to get this."
Students or parents can claim the credit
when filing for taxes in the spring.
All course materials apply for the credit as
long as documentation, such as transcripts, a
list of textbooks and receipts, are provided.
"In the meantime, just keep track of your
expenses," Hershman said.
The first $2,000 in out-of-pocket expenses
goes toward the tax credit and is returned.
Any amount more than $2,000 will have 25
percent of the remaining expenses paid back
up to $2,500, according to the American Op-
portunity Tax Credit Web site.
The tax credit is also 40 percent refundable,
providing up to a $1,000 refund for qualifying
taxpayers.
Hershman said the tax credit was designed
to ease some of the stress felt by college stu-
dents during the economic recession.UF freshman Danielle Agostino said the
tax credit will provide relief for her parents,
and she plans to take advantage of the oppor-
tunity.
"It's really hard right now," she said, add-
ing she didn't qualify for financial aid. "A
large number of students get financial aid,
but a large number don't, too." However, eco-
nomics professor Mark Rush said UF students
will not be affected as much as community
colleges and other universities throughout
Florida.Rush explained thatbecause manyUF fam-
ilies have higher incomes and most students
qualify for the Bright Futures Scholarship,
they won't need or qualify for the credit.
"It won't have a huge impact on UF," Rush
said. "There will be some students [at UF who
really need it, but] community colleges may
be a big beneficiary."

American Opportunity Tax Credit can be
found at www.textbookaid.org/Default.

How To Get Money For Your Books:
* The American Opportunity Tax Credit is offering up to $2,500
to students for out-of-pocket expenses.
To be eligible, students must claim the credit
when they or their parents file taxes in the spring.
While filling out tax forms, students or their families must complete Form 8863,
attached to any 1040 or 1040A form.
Students must keep receipts, transcripts and the list of textbooks and course materials.
The documents must be sent off when filing the claim.

UF RESEARCH
UF creates new grape variety
By CAROLYN TILLO
Alligator Writer
UF scientists have just released a tasty creation.
They debuted a new variety of grape this sum-
mer that they had been growing, propagating and
testing for about 16 years, according to Dennis Gray,
one of the developers.
Gray, a professor and developmental biologist
with UF's Institute of Food and Agricultural Scienc-es, said the variety, named the Southern Jewel by a
Florida wine maker, is adapted to grow in Florida
and the Southeast U.S. because it can withstand the
humidity and resist diseases in the environment.
According to Gray, the Southern Jewel is a seed-
ed grape with a thick, edible skin and is classified as
a muscadine grape.
"However, unlike most muscadine grapes, which
produce clusters of four to six grapes, the Southern
Jewel variety produces clusters of 12 to 16 grapes,"
he said. "It has an extremely fruity flavor, and the
berries are quite large, sometimes the diameter of a
quarter."
Jacob Paulk, the largest grower of mus-
cadine grapes in the U.S., is growing the
Southern Jewels at his farm in Wray, Ga.
He said he hopes the plants will help the
muscadine grape market, which is limited to
the Southeast, to grow.
Paulk said the market is limited because
any temperature under 10 degrees Fahren-
heit would kill muscadines. People in the
Southeast are familiar with them because the
native muscadine grapes were grown in this
region, but the grapes are not as well known
in the Midwest or Northeast.
"New, good tasting varieties will help
us sell," Paulk said.
However, the plants are still young and
not yet ready for picking. When they are
ready, he hopes the new variety can be
picked in bunches and packed in the field to
save some labor in the factory.
"I'm looking forward to seeing it and packing
it," Paulk said.

Virtual class links students with international experts without travel fees

parties' needs," he said, "which, as any architect can attest
to, is always a challenge."
According to Javaheri, the Second Life classroom uses
multimedia from in-game Powerpoint presentations to You-
Tube showings on the tiny televisions.
Students also have the option to communicate with one
another and Jacobs via headset or chat.
Jacobs said while the virtual classroom isn't a substitute
for taking a class in person, it is more engaging than a stan-
dard online class.
"The beauty of the environment is that they are experi-
encing what they are studying," she said. "It's no longer hy-
pothetical, dry discussion but a lived experience."
Aside from the virtual face to virtual face interaction, Ja-
cobs said learning in Gator Nation Island classroom offers
the ability to connect the students with experts around the
world without the cost of booking fees and plane tickets.
"Now, an expert in Europe can simply log in and be right
in the class with my students," she said. "It's wonderful."
Aside from the virtual face-to-virtual face interaction, Ja-
cobs said learning in Gator Nation Island classroom offers
the ability to connect the students with experts around the
world without the cost of booking fees and plane tickets.
Although the interface is made as user-friendly as pos-
sible, Jacobs said the learning curve could make it a chal-
lenge to some.
"This is not for someone who has little patience or is
afraid of technology. It would be too frustrating," she said.
But according to Jacobs, the effort it takes to get used to
the Second Life classroom is worth the benefit of using an
interactive virtual classroom over a dry online class.
"It's not just you (the student) and a computer screen.
Rather you are in an actual class with other students," she
said. "You are still interacting with other human beings in
real time and benefiting from the intellectual exchange that
is the hallmark [of classroom learning]."fl~II

robbery suspect
By KATHERINE BEIN
Alligator Writer
Gainesville Police are still searching for a man who
was involved in an attempted armed robbery of a family
early Thursday morning.
His accomplice, Joe Meadows Jr., 20, was found nearby
and was identified by the family as one of the attackers.
Armed with handguns and duct tape, the two men en-
tered the home through an unlocked sliding glass door at
about 12:20 a.m., a GPD arrest report stated.
When they got inside, the men found a
Local 16-year-old boy sleeping on the couch and
NewS attempted to tie him up. The boy's mother,
father and two younger brothers heard the
noise and went downstairs.
According to the report, the men threatened the family
with guns but left when the mother ran outside to call for
help.
With the help of GPD police dog Redd, officers found
Meadows hiding on the back porch of a nearby apart-
ment, the report stated.
After interviewing the family, officer Jon Rappa wrote
in the report that the shaken-up 9-year-old boy tugged
on the officer's pant leg, crying and said, "This has never
happened before."
Meadows was charged with four counts of aggravated
assault, one count of aggravated battery and five counts
of armed burglary.

Meyer: Best depth
we've had on 0-line
0 THE GATORS GO EIGHT-
DEEP WITH VERSATILE
LINEMEN.
By KYLE MAISTRI
Alligator Staff Writer
km aistri@alIlIigator org
When football and versatil-
ity are in the same sentence,
300-pound linemen aren't usually
what come to mind.
UF coach Urban Meyer has had
the luxury of leaving the offensive
line in flux during fall practice be-
cause he has multiple projected
starters who can play more than
one position on the line.
One of those players is junior
Carl Johnson, who said it is impor-
tant to have flexibility on the line in
the event of an injury.
"If it's a very tight game -let's
use Ole Miss last year -you don't
want to have a specialist go down
and you need a specialist to put
back in," Johnson said. "The way
coach (Steve) Addazio teaches us,
he teaches offensive linemen to be
versatile."
Meyer said versatility hasn'tbeen something the Gators have
had since he's been here.
The only two starters who are
locked into place are Mike Pounc-
ey and Marcus Gilbert, who are
holding down the right guard and
right tackle positions, respectively.
Other than those two spots,
Meyer said he would go with
sophomore Matt Patchan at left
tackle, Johnson at left guard and
Maurkice Pouncey at center if the
season started tomorrow.
Johnson and Maurkice Pounc-
ey, who can slide back and forth
between left guard and center if
need be, were always expected
to make the starting rotation, but
one scenario saw Johnson moving
to tackle and Pouncey moving to
guard to make room for redshirt
freshman Sam Robey at center.
"Having the ability to move
Carl Johnson gives you flexibility,"
Meyer said.
For now, Patchan has done
enough to win over the coaches by
proving he could add the weight
needed to start at the college level
Bulking up was no easy task,
as Patchan is known for being a

Gators bond over summer
By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
a berry@aligator org
The Florida volleyball players had a lot
to learn and little time to put it all together
before their 2008 season began -from how
drills were run to what certain terminology
meant -even each other's names.
Far from the nametag-wearing group
that went through training camp last fall, 14
of the team's 15 players were in Gainesville
for at least part of the summer this year,
playing pick-up games together and work-
ing out under the supervision of Matt
DeLancey, the assistant strength and condi-
tioning coach for UF Olympic sports.
The only player who wasn't at UF
throughout the summer was junior set-
ter Brynja Rodgers, who was finishing up
classes at New Mexico State before trans-
ferring to Florida. Everyone else -even
the three new freshmen -chose to attendclasses and train during the summer semes-
ter, the most players to do so during coach
Mary Wise's 19 years at UF.
With the players a year older and more
accustomed to sharing the court, the open-
ing match of the season is something to be
excited about -not ner-
Wisevous. Unlike last year,
Florida's season-opening
tournament, which be-
gins with a 7 p.m. match-
up with UNLV tonight
and concludes with a
7 p.m. match Saturday
against Colorado, won't
have to be part of the
feeling-out process.
"We've been planning for this season
since way back in January, when we started
individual sessions," Wise said. "That's the
beauty of it -we could actually be proac-
tive because we had players to work with.

"He eats healthy. When I say healthy

after the Gators' practice on Wednesday.
Assuming the starters re-

Maurice Hurt and sophomore
James Wilson are all expected
Football to see playing time off the
bench this season.
The potential for so many
different looks has kept at least one defensive
lineman off balance -UF junior defensive
end Carlos Dunlap.
"Florida's offensive line is as good as any,"
Dunlap said. "Seeing how they change up the
positions so much, that messes up the defense.
You're so used to seeing somebody at guard,
when he gets at tackle, he plays different so
you have to adjust your game."MIKE, from page 21
having the black stripe removed from the freshmen's helmets,
an honor bestowed on athletes who display the kind of work
ethic, focus and grasp of the playbook that Meyer is looking
for.
What do you think fosters more team cohesion, working to
earn respect in practice and sharing personal problems or shav-
ing someone's eyebrows?
It's not talked about much, but the level of respect among
teammates that Meyer pushes is just as big a part of his success-
ful formula as emphasizing special teams or speed.
Meyer has always been a proponent of letting the best play-
ers play, regardless of age, and making sure the freshmen are
treated like human beings is a necessary step on the way.
It's especially important now, as a talented group of fresh-
men has a chance to learn from a team that could go down as
one of the best ever. And Meyer knows he needs a few newbies
to step up and produce this season.
Receiver David Nelson, who said he felt "pushed aside" as a
freshman in 2005, has watched the whole transition unfold.
"Now, the freshmen come in and we embrace them as one ofours," Nelson said. "As soon as they get that stripe off their hel-
met, they're a part of this family and what we have here. We do
a great job of knowing that. In the past, freshmen have come in
and had substantial roles on offense, defense and special teams.
We know they mean a lot to us, and there will be a special fresh-
man this year to contribute to this team."
Throughout two-a-days, all of the freshmen I interviewed
had nothing but good things to say about how the veterans
have treated them. Their experiences seem to be in pretty stark
contrast to those of Nelson and his classmates, showing just
how much of an improvement Meyer has made.
Shortly after Meyer spoke last week, Zook issued a state-
ment saying he has never condoned or even been accused of
condoning hazing, a pretty necessary move considering the
possible implications on recruiting.
Zook gets blamed for too much around here. He left the
program in pretty good shape, but this is one area he has no
defense in. It's pretty black-and-white.
When Zook left, freshmen were getting hazed, and wheth-
er or not he told them to do it isn't the issue. It happened on
his watch, and Meyer deserves praise for actively turning it
around.
Summer workouts increase familiarity before season starts
VOLLEYBALL, from page 21
This team, 14 of them here this summer,
made that learning curve even faster."
Wise admitted recently she was a little
nervous before the 2008 season, a rare feel-
ing for a coach who now has 18 straight
Southeastern Conference championships
to her name.
Each player made the choice to stay the
summer and train at UF individually, but
the result of their decisions will be seen
through the team's performance, as theinexperience and unfamiliarity that wor-
ried Wise before last season should be a
thing of the past.
"We feel like we're a step ahead al-
ready, that we don't have to use these
first couple matches as practice, that we're
ready to go and ready to compete from
the first match," senior libero Elyse Cu-
sack said.
The higher level of familiarity allowed
the Gators to bypass the preseason for-
malities that slowed them down last year
and will help improve the Gators' com-munication on the court, but sophomore
outside hitter Kristy Jaeckel said it also al-
lows them to play more aggressively and
confidently.
"It helps us on the court because when
you have that trust in your teammates,
you know that they're going to have your
back," Jaeckel said. "With passing, you
have to know your responsibilities and
you have to trust that the other person is
going to do theirs too. If you have doubt
in your teammates, you might try to do
too much."

Marsh hurts ankle,
held out of practice
By MIKE DIFERDINANDO
Alligator Staff Writer
mdiferdinando@alligator org
Defensive tackle Lawrence
Marsh missed practice Thursday
with a sprained ankle.
UF coach Urban Meyer said he
expects Marsh to return to practice
Monday.
Marsh started 13 games for the
Gators last season, racking up 28
tackles and three sacks.
TRATTOU AT TIGHT END: It looks like
Meyer is going to be taking a page
out of his friend Bill Belichick's
playbook.
The coach revealed Thursday
that defensive end Justin Trattou
could see time at tight end this sea-
son in goal-line situations.
Meyer said that he plans to use
Trattou, who has been practic-
ing with the first team offense in
goal-line situations, the same way
Belichick used Mike Vrabel-
Vrabel, a linebacker now with
the Kansas City Chiefs, caught 10
passes, all for touchdowns, includ-
ing one each in Super Bowl XXX-VIII and Super Bowl XXXIX while
in New England.
Meyer said freshman Desmond
Parks will likely redshirt this sea-
son. Other than starter Aaron Her-
nandez, Parks was the only tight
end with the potential to see play-
ing time.
"If we have an (injury) at tight
end, that's an issue," Meyer said.
BRANTLEYTOSEE TIME: Sophomore
quarterback John
Brantley could be
logging some steady
playing time this fallFootball for the Gators.
Meyer said he
hopes to use Brantley in game situ-
ations this season and not just in
mop-up duty.
"I don't want to make any
promises because that always
comes back to haunt you, but he's
earned playing time at Florida.
We're anxious to get him in the
game," Meyer said. "He's earned
it. It's not charity work. How
much? That remains to be seen, but
he'll play."
Brantley threw for 235 yardsHarrison Diamond / Alligator Staff

Florida will count on youth in home opener against FlU
By TYLER JETT
Alligator Writer
tjett@ailigator org
On the surface, the No. 7 UF soc-
cer team looks like an experienced,
senior-heavy squad.
In Friday's season-opening win
against Miami, the Gators (1-0-0)
started seven fourth-year players,
and the game's lone goal came when
seniors Tricia Townsend and Ashlee
Elliott connected on a pass that El-
liott headed in.
But the roster is brimming with
youth. Freshmen and sophomores
comprise 75 percent of the team,
and five newcomers saw action last
week.
One reason for the Gators' lop-
sided roster is a 2007
signing class that con-
sisted of four players.
When UF takes on
Soccer Florida International
(1-0-0) tonight at 7,
defender Nicky Kit
will be the only remaining Gator
from that class.
Against Miami, coach Becky
Burleigh started two freshmen, mid-
fielder Erika Tymrak and defender
Kathryn Williamson. While they
both got their first college start in
Coral Gables, the paths they took to
get there are much different.
Williamson redshirted last year
after unsuccessfully rehabbing her
torn ACL. She injured her knee
making an awkward cut during a
Thanksgiving club tournament."My knee went one way and my
body went the other," she said.
Williamson said she pushed her-
self too hard during rehab trying toprepare for her first season at UF,
eventually forcing her to have a sec-
ond surgery last August.
She was reduced to a cheerleaderlast year but said everyone was so
enthusiastic on the sidelines that she
grew into her role. That is not to say
she was content, though.
Andrew Stanfill / Alligator Staff
UF defender Nicky Kit is the only player from the 2007 signing class still on the Gators' roster. The junior
played in every match last season, including 19 starts at left back."I wanted tobe out there so bad,"
she said.
Burleigh announces UF's start-
ing lineup on Thursdays so the unit
can jell before the weekend matches.
Many fringe players, Williamson
included, nervously await the an-
nouncement. When she finally
heard her name called, Williamson
tried not to get too excited.
"I still was hesitant because I
didn't know," she said. "People
could change (the lineup) at the last
minute."
The same month Williamson
suffered her tough injury, Tymrak
played right midfield for the U.S.
National team at the 2008 FIFA U-17
Women's World Cup. Tymrak, a
2009 Parade All-American, played
in three of six matches and recorded
assists in two wins. Practices under
U.S. coach Kazbek Tambi helped
prepare her for college soccer.
"(Tambi) always had us play
with guys, so we were used to play-
ing quicker," Tymrak said. "And
college is quicker and faster than
club soccer."
But Tymrak needed the veterans
to teach her how to play in UF's for-
mations, specifically when to drop
back on defense and when to attack.
"I play in the (midfield) and An-
gela Napolitano plays in there with
me, so she would help me. And then
Lauren Hyde and Ashlee (Elliott)
would help me defensively, pulling
me back," she said. "Basically every-
one on the field would give me clues
to help me out."
