A UF student was arrested early Satur-
day morning after she allegedly stabbed her 
roommate’s door with a knife and threat-ened to kill her.
Gainesville Police charged Jessica Gor-
don, 21, of 612 NE 10th Ave., with aggravat-ed assault and simple battery, according to a GPD arrest report.
The incident started at about 3:30 a.m. 
Saturday when Gordon returned home with her roommates from a club, said GPD spokesman Ofﬁ  cer Ben Tobias.
Earlier in the night, Gordon saw her ex-
boyfriend dancing with another woman, To-bias said. When Gordon returned home, she wanted to go see him.
Sarah Margio, one of Gordon’s room-
mates, didn’t want Gordon to drive because she had too much to drink, so she called Gordon’s current boyfriend to pick her up, Tobias said.
Gordon, however, left anyway but re-
turned 10 minutes later. Tobias said she went back inside and started banging on Margio’s door, accusing Margio of ruining her rela-tionship with her current boyfriend, Tobias said.
When Margio opened her door, Gordon 
pushed her to the ground. Margio then ran back into her room and locked the door, To-bias said.
Gordon then grabbed a knife from the 
kitchen and started stabbing the door, yell-ing “I have a knife, and I am going to kill you” to Margio, Tobias said.
After police arrived, Gordon told ofﬁ  cers 
she intended to use the knife to pick Mar-gio’s lock to speak with her, according to the report. Gordon added she only threatened Margio ﬁ  guratively.
Police arrested Gordon and booked her 
into the Alachua County Jail on Sunday af-ternoon. She was released at about 1 p.m. Monday on her own recognizance.
Margio declined to comment. Gordon 
couldn’t be reached for comment.
Tobias said Margio wanted to withdraw 
the complaint against Gordon, but because she committed a felony, GPD couldn’t drop the charges.

A blackout temporarily dulled the se-
quined gowns of the 14 Miss University of 
Florida contestants Monday night at the Phillips Center for the Performing Arts.
About 500 people attended the event 
sponsored by Florida Blue Key.
“It’s our 57th year putting on the pageant 
and our ﬁ  rst blackout,” said Florida Blue Key President Dana Somerstein.
The pageant started out as planned. The 
Q-and-A segment went without a hitch, as did several competitions including a swim-suit and ﬁ  tness showcase, a talent portion and an eveningwear segment.
While the judges were tabulating the re-
sults backstage, Sabor Latino took the stage for a surprise performance when the Phil-lips Center lost power.
At ﬁ  rst, the crowd thought it was part of 
the performance.
“Once we realized the power wasn’t go-
ing to come back on, we quickly evacuated the building,” said Matt Cox, the operations director for University of Florida Perform-ing Arts.
UPD arrived to make sure people evacu-
ated safely . The audience then stood outside in the rain.
Dance Marathon members raised morale 
by pulling up a car, blaring a mix through the stereo and performing a choreographed dance.
The cause of the power outage could not 
be determined, but the generator provided emergency lighting for the remaining audi-ence members to gather in the lobby of the Phillips Center. The 14 contestants ﬂ  anked the double staircase while winners and run-ners-up were announced.
Rachel Hart, an advertising and business 
freshman, won. She will continue on to the Miss Florida pageant. Miss UF pageant evacuated after power loss

A sense of excitement hung in the air as Idylwild Elementary 
School students ﬁ  led into the school’s cafeteria Monday morning.
After a three-day wait, the students ﬁ  nally had a chance to take 
a tour of their renewed school. Over the weekend, volunteers with 
Project Makeover worked to beautify the school, painting murals on the school walls and cleaning up the grounds.Principal Daniel Ferguson said because his school’s grade jumped 
from a D to a B last year, he wanted to reward his students with a surprise: a new playground.
“It symbolizes a place where the kids can just simply let loose 
and have fun,” he said.
About 80 percent of Idylwild’s 676 students are on the free and 
reduced lunch program, said Kelley Kostamo, partnership specialist for Alachua County Public Schools.
The improved grade motivated the school to raise money for the 
new playground, which cost about $21,000, Ferguson said.Project Makeover revamps Idylwild Elementary

◗ ABOUT 700 UF 
STUDENTS APPLIED TO 
MED SCHOOL.
JENSEN WERLEY
Alligator Contributing Writer
A survey released last week 
by Kaplan Test Prep shows 
that only 32 percent of medical school students plan to go into general health care, while the other 68 percent plans to have a specialization.
UF is the fifth largest school 
for premed students, said Amjed Saffarini, vice president of graduate programs at Ka-plan.
Russell Schaffer, senior 
communications manager for Kaplan, said 713 students from UF applied to med school last year.
However, there is still a shortage of 65,000 doctors.
Saffarini said there are 
more people growing older who need more health care. He also said the Affordable Health Care Act brings in about 30 million people, who put addi-tional strain on the system. 
Also, current doctors are 
heading to retirement, leaving open positions. He said more doctors are choosing special-ties.
In addition to new changes 
such as the Affordable Health Care Act, there have also been recent changes to the MCAT.
Safarini said changes to the 
MCAT should help fill doctors positions left by the shortage.
“If students are learning 
harder sciences, then they might be better prepared and can get through school faster,” he said. “Med school can be three years instead of four.”There is a shortage 
of doctors in the US, new survey showslocal

Monkey see, monkey do. But for four days, Wendell, 
a brown capuchin monkey , had to rely on his hands and 
nose after he was found temporarily blind Wednesday at the Jungle Friends Primate Sanctuary.
Sara Smith, an assistant to the sanctuary director, said 
when sanctuary staff members tried to give Wendell a piece of popcorn, he was unresponsive.
“He went blind after he was self-attacking, which is a 
result of diabetic neuropathy,” Smith said.
On Monday, a veterinarian found Wendell’s blood 
pressure and glucose level were too high, causing his blood vessels to tighten and constrict his eyes, said Kari Bagnall, the sanctuary’s founder. Bagnall said sanctuary staff members worked through the weekend to remod-el Wendell’s habitat to make it easier for him to move around because of his limited eyesight.
On Sunday, however, workers made a surprising 
discovery: Wendell regained his sight.
“When his blood pressure and glucose level went 
down, he could see again,” Bagnall said.
Now, sanctuary staff are watching Wendell’s glucose 
levels, so he won’t go blind again.
“If it does happen again, and his blood vessels rup-
ture, it could be irreversible,” said Nicole Villella, a vet-erinary assistant who has cared for Wendell for a year.
Staff members will keep to fixing the habitat as a pre-
caution.
“If that happens again, I don’t want him to be blind 
and then fall,” Bagnall said.Monkey regains vision in sanctuary

UF criminology sophomore Brett 
Helms made the mistake of turning 
on his wipers to remove the thick layer of yellow particles that cov-ered his windshield.
Breathing in at just the wrong 
time, Helms let out a loud sneeze. The culprit: pollen.
“I have horrible allergies,” 
Helms, 19, said. “So having that happen made it worse for the rest of the day . I literally just stopped at the store and bought a pack of Claritin on my way to school.”
For many students and residents 
of Gainesville, late February means 
the beginning of pollen season and allergies.
Dr. Shih-Wen 
Huang, the head of the allergy clinic at Shands at UF, said pollen 
tends to stay in the air when it is dry outside and humidity is low.“The weather pretty much de-
termines the amount of pollen in the air,” Huang said. “The sources, though, include a total of about 14 different trees that could produce these pollens.”
The most common perpetrators 
of pollen production in Gainesville are maple, oak, pine and cedar trees, Huang said.
Huang said treatment of allergies 
can be difficult because nature is im-possible to control.
“I just wish I could stop blowing 
my nose,” Helms said.Pollen leaves some under the weather

◗ UF SELLS GATOR ADIDAS CLOTHING.

During a talk at UF, an Indonesian sweatshop worker said he 
was threatened with death by factory owners for demanding sev-
erance pay for him and his coworkers.
Aslam Hidayat worked at the PT Kizone factory for Adidas.“Adidas products are high quality, but the management is not,” 
he said.
Garrett Strain, the national organizer for United Students 
Against Sweatshops, visited UF Monday with Hidagat and an-other factory worker in an effort to get UF to cut its contract with Adidas.
UF sells Gator Adidas clothing. Adidas, the second largest 
sports apparel provider in the world, brought in $8.21 billion in gross profit in 2011 but is refusing to pay about $1.8 million in le-gally-owed severance pay to 2,800 PT Kizone workers, according to the Badidas Campaign and Worker Tour.
Slain said UF was just one of many stops he has made in the 
Badidas Campaign, which has been traveling to various college campuses to get them to cut their contract with Adidas.
He said so far, this tour has been a success. Six universities, 
including Cornell University, the University of Washington and Georgetown University , have already agreed to cut each of their contracts.
Theresa Faleti, a 20-year-old family , youth and community 
sciences junior, is a member of the African Student Union and at-tended the meeting in Ustler Hall.
“I plan on raising awareness by sharing it with my organization 
and going to Tigert Hall to present [UF’s] president with a letter,” Faleti said.Former sweatshop 
worker urges UF to cut Adidas contractStudents were excited for the new slide
“They said it couldn’t be done, 
and we just pushed through,” Fergu-
son said. “I kept asking everybody, ‘Just do what you can; do what you can,’ and it came together.”
For the last six years, Project 
Makeover, a nonprofit UF group, has selected an Alachua County elemen-tary school to renovate, said Ashley Podoll, executive director of Project Makeover Idylwild Elementary.Podoll said this was the first year 
a renovated elementary school did its own fundraising.
“They knew what it was that 
they wanted, and they knew that it was out of Makeover’s price range,” Kostamo said. “That was what their dream project really was.”  
The Gainesville Woman’s Club 
made the largest donation, said Fer -
guson.
Precision Playgrounds Co., a 
Jacksonville-based playground con-struction company, contributed.
Brian BeauPre, playground site supervisor, said he and his co-work-ers were proud to take part.
“In 20 years of construction, a 
5-year-old shows more apprecia-tion for what we do than most hom-eowners or builders,” he said.
Many students said they looked 
forward to playing on the play-ground’s slide, including 7-year-old second grader Isaiah Boyd.
“It’s awesome and fun,” he said.  
“I like swirls like ice cream — with a cherry on top.”

Pill bottles aren’t living up to their prom-
ises.
“It’s like a foot long that’s only 11 inches,” 
Paul Doering said. 
Doering, a distinguished service professor 
from UF’s College of Pharmacy, said recent 
information on dietary supplement labels is both disappointing and unacceptable.
Some vitamin D labels aren’t living up to 
their potency expectations. Labels promised a particular percentage of strength, but the pills inside varied significantly from that number.
Some provided as little as 9 or as much as 
140 percent of its claimed potency, according to the Journal of the American Medical As-sociation.
The association published its results on di-
etary supplements last week.
Although companies creating and supply-
ing dietary supplements are not required to comply with Food and Drug Administration guidelines, companies may choose to meet the standards of the U.S. Pharmacopeial Con-vention for a seal of approval and trustwor -
thiness.
USP is a nongovernmental organization 
that provides standards for purity and po-tency of pharmaceutical products. It requires compounded pills to contain 90 to 110 per -
cent of the active ingredient.
The vitamin D pills the researchers stud-
ied weren’t up to USP’s standards.
“One of the things you expect when you 
buy any kind of medicinal product, no matter where it comes from, you expect it to be up to its labeled potency,” Doering said
He said even though vitamin D is not as 
potentially toxic as a narcotic pain reliever or cancer drugs, inaccurate potency labeling is intolerable.
Strength or effectiveness of a pill may di-
minish over time due to heat, light or mois-ture, Doering said. 
But there are no variables that explain pills 
gaining strength to make some supplements 
about 40 percent of their original claim.
“I can assure you that 
the tablet or capsule wasn’t 
gaining potency as it sat there on the shelf, which leads me to believe that when it went out the door of the manufacturing plant, the stuff was super potent,” 
Doering said.
There is always potential for a dietary 
supplement or vitamin to interact adversely with medicines.
Student Health Care Center Marketing Co-
ordinator Catherine Seemann urged students to not only look for USP’s stamp of approval on any supplement but also to ask their doc-tors or pharmacists before they take it.
“It’s extremely important to disclose that 
information to your health care provider,” she said.
When it comes to dietary supplements, 
“using a healthy dose of skepticism will lead you to the promise land,” Doering said.Students may find Vitamin 
D pills hard to swallow

To the liberal activist group Progress New Mexico, 
Eric Szeman and Diane Avila represent evil, greedy capitalists who exploit their workers by refusing to 
comply with the city of Albuquerque’s minimum-wage increase.
To others, Szeman and Avila are just small business 
owners trying to make ends meet while running the Route 66 Malt Shop. If the owners were to comply with the city’s minimum wage increase, Szeman argues, they would have to close down the business and lay off 12 employees.
The minimum wage became the topic of national at-
tention when President Barack Obama declared in his State of the Union address the government would “raise the federal minimum wage to $9.00 an hour.” Under the current minimum wage, the president argued, a full-time minimum wage employee still earns below the poverty line, and a change in this policy would lift millions out of poverty.
But would it really?A 1999 study by economists David Neumark, Mark 
Schweitzer and William Wascher found increases in the minimum wage lead to more poverty. The authors con-clude minimum wage increases “do, no doubt, help some families escape poverty; but the employment losses asso-ciated with a higher minimum also appear to cause some families to fall into poverty.”
In other words, any gains experienced by individuals 
in minimum wage jobs are outweighed by the increase in unemployment that results from businesses not being able to hire and/or lay off workers to compensate for the higher wages.
A 2012 Cato Institute report cited a study from 2010, 
which found when the federal government increased the minimum wage from $5.15 to $7.25, “only 15.8 percent of the workers who were expected to gain from it lived in poor households.” This occurs because many of the low-skilled workers who are employed in minimum wage jobs are second or third earners living in households with incomes well above the poverty line.
Other studies have shown 
that the minimum wage has an adverse effect on teenagers, espe-cially young minorities.
Furthermore, if employers try 
to avoid laying off workers, the 
costs of minimum wage increases are carried by consum-ers with higher prices. Because a higher share of a low-income individual’s earnings is spent on necessities such as food, it’s hard to see how an increase in food prices help out poor people.
But for some progressive do-gooders, the economic 
realities of the minimum wage play no role in deciding whether we should keep increasing it.  
For Pat Davis, executive director of Progress New Mex-
ico, the Route 66 Malt Shop owners’ failure to comply with the local minimum wage law “amounts to stealing from their workers.” Although a great example of hyperbole, Davis fails to mention that without Szeman and Avila’s entrepreneurship, many of these employees would be out of work and are only entitled to the wage voluntarily agreed upon when they were hired.
Indeed, according to Szeman, his employees signed a 
contract agreeing to work at their old wage. Furthermore, when you factor in tips, Szeman and Avila argue they make less than their employees, having to reinvest their earnings into the business to keep it aﬂ  oat.
If the minimum wage is increased again, there will be

The Onion stepped 
on some toes
Where do we draw the lines of comedy? Do we cross 
them when a satirical news publication calls a 9-year-old girl the C-word?
Last night, during the Oscars ceremony, The Onion tweeted: 
“Everyone else seems afraid to say it, but that Quvenzhane Wal-lis is kind of a [four-letter word that begins with C], right?”
“By 1 a.m. Monday , dozens of tweets per second were being 
posted, virtually all of them expressing contempt, incredulity or outrage,” reported USA Today.
A comedy website tweeted something more outrageous than 
they normally do, and people reacted accordingly.
“@TheOnion Identify the writer. Let him defend that ab-
horrent verbal attack of a child. You call it humor I call it hor-rendous,” wrote “The Wire” star Wendell Pierce, who also de-manded the site apologize.
There seemed to be few people online defending the website 
for doing its job. Take a look at the front page of The Onion’s website every now and then; you’ll ﬁ  nd equally disturbing or offensive content that hardly anybody bats an eyelash toward.
“After being up for an hour, the backlash gathered, and the 
tweet was deleted,” wrote BuzzFeed’s Kate Aurthur. “Was it meant to be some sort of joke reﬂ  ecting on how people talk about someone like Anne Hathaway?”
Our ﬁ  rst instinct was to assume the tweet was a social com-
mentary on the many different types of hate Hathaway receives, for some reason. But really, what else are we supposed to expect from The Onion? Right now, you can read an article “written” by Daniel Day-Lewis titled “While I’m Glad I Won, I Personally Believe Abraham Lincoln Deserved To Die.”
Have you heard of anyone being all up-in-arms over that 
whole story? Not at all. The whole thing describes what a ter-rible person Lincoln was and the award-winning actor who played him in a movie “should have been assassinated much, much sooner than he was.”
Are we condoning The Onion’s behavior toward the young 
Wallis? Absolutely not. People who write comedic pieces for a living should be able to tell where the boundaries are. Calling a 9-year-old anything more than precocious is not alright.
However, no one should be surprised they did it. Writers and 
editors of The Onion seem to be continually pushing themselves to be more edgy and to be more “out there.”
Journalist and columnist Joel Stein tweeted: “We got that @
TheOnion was making fun of our celeb-obsessed, celeb-jealous, celeb-dissing culture and not Quevenzhane Wallis, right?”
They didn’t convey their point in a non-offensive way . That’s 
the problem.
On Monday morning, The Onion’s CEO issued an apology . 
The statement called the tweet “crude and offensive — not to mention inconsistent with The Onion’s commitment to parody and satire, however biting.”
It seems like a weird line to draw. At what point is something 
horribly offensive but still funny, and at what point does the CEO of a company have to issue an apology?

opinions@alligator.org TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 26, 2013 § ALLIGATOR, 7
National security threats often invoke images of bombs, 
guns and invading military forces, but one of the most pressing threats to the United States involves none of 
these things. Instead, powers hostile to the United States and its interests have quietly launched domestic cyberterrorism attacks against U.S. banks and, most recently, against popular American news agencies. Such subtle acts of espionage, and the likelihood they will only become more damaging, translates into a dire need for Congress to quickly pass legislation that beefs up cybersecu-rity defenses.
The issue of cybersecurity came to the forefront of national 
discourse in January, when The New York Times revealed they had fallen victim to a four-month-long network security breach, which reportedly originated in China. The initial breach occurred about Oct. 25, the publication date of an article reporting on the family of the country’s prime minister. This disturbing news was followed by revelations that The Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg News and The Washington Post experienced similar issues with-in their own networks.
The fact that unfriendly powers are carrying out such breach-
es against institutions of free speech is unsettling enough, but the threats extend beyond mere invasions of privacy. Large attacks were leveled in September against the online systems of JPMor -
gan Chase & Co., Bank of America, Wells Fargo, U.S. Bank and PNC Bank, resulting in an at least daylong denials of service.
Such attacks indicate much more is at stake, with some espe-
cially problematic areas being not only economic institutions and tech firms but also power grids for nuclear power plants and water purification systems. “Nation-state attackers will target critical 
infrastructure networks such as power grids at an unprecedented scale in 2013 … These types of attacks could grow more sophisti-cated, and the slippery slope could lead to the loss of human life,” said Chiranjeev Bordoloi, CEO of security company TopPatch. 
According to a CNN interview with James Lewis, a cyberse-
curity expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, at least 12 of the world’s largest military powers are working to construct complicated cyberwarfare systems.
It would be no stretch to say the United States has the most to 
lose at the hands of these powers if our government continues to put cybersecurity on the backburner.
Though the media’s constant bombardment of the public with 
images of war-ravaged Afghanistan would suggest otherwise, the events in a remote desert nation do not necessarily pose a greater threat to national security than seemingly less dangerous cyberattacks. The recent infiltrations should remind our legisla-tors of this and prompt them to not only engage in serious dis-cussion with other nations such as China, but also quickly pass legislation that would re-allocate substantial defense resources to building a stronger cyberdefense system.
Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich., chairman of the House Intel-
ligence Committee,, spoke to the immediacy of the situation in an interview with Politico: “Foreign cyberattackers are targeting every aspect of the American economy every day and Congress needs to act with urgency to protect our national security and our economy,” he said.
With the defense budget and looming sequestration cuts up 
for debate, Congress needs to take advantage of an opportunity for bipartisan cooperation. Instead of continuing partisan bicker -
ing on troop withdrawals and timetables, lawmakers must work to pass serious legislation that will provide the tools necessary to combat lurking cyberthreats.
Attacks on public utilities and power plants can create not only 
inconvenient but dangerous situations for everyday Americans, and the crash of a bank’s computer system can wreak economic havoc. In addition, some of the nation’s most sensitive intelli-gence information could be discretely collected and used against us in unexpected attacks.
Aggression in cyberspace is unfortunately a product of our 
times, truly illustrating both the magic and terror that modern technology can bring. As such, our leaders must act, so we are prepared for whatever comes our way. Technological capacities will only continue to grow as time passes, and as nations un-friendly to the United States develop economically and political-ly, the possibility of more serious attacks will only increase. Con-structing a stronger defense in U.S. cyberspace is of paramount importance, and waiting longer could only harm the nation — the time for action is now.

UWireThe college campus is no doubt a progres-
sive environment. Of all places, UF probably would not suffer from an issue like gender 
discrimination. 
However, is this completely true?Is it possible there are socially constructed re-
strictions on each gender, even on a socially pro-gressive college campus?
I believe one of the most influential contributors 
to social behavior is advertisement in the media.
It is no surprise that the media affects public per -
ception. 
However, it tends to be a shock to some that ad-
vertisements affect what we perceive as normal.
Most people think they tune out advertisements, 
but the reality is, subconsciously or not, advertise-ments ingrain in us what we are supposed to believe is the ideal representation of beauty or normalcy. 
Jean Kilbourne, an author and filmmaker, ex-
plores the consequences of girls being taught at a young age that the most important thing is appear -
ance.
In her documentary “Killing Us Softly,” she 
speaks about how failure to look the way models in advertisements do is both inevitable and psycho-logically harmful.
Advertisements define what is normal and there-
fore what is feminine: to be beautiful, young and thin.
Advertisements very often sexually objectify 
women by turning them into the product they want to sell. Lately, there has been an objectification of men as well, but the effects are very different.
When women are sexually objectified, their body 
language portrays submissiveness, weakness and sexual availability. Men are usually portrayed as strong and powerful. So what are the consequences of this? 
Through advertisements, the media teaches us 
that men always have to be dominant. There are some disturbing advertisements depicting gang rape, such as a Dolce & Gabbana ad of a woman lay-ing down in a bathing suit, a shirtless man holding her down, with several other men watching. Some advertisements even depict sexual battery.
Do advertisers want us to think this is the norm 
in our society? 
The creators of ads probably did not intend this, 
but they are nevertheless perpetuating it. Sexual ob-jectification leads to “a trivi-alization of sex,” as termed by Kilbourne. Objectifying human beings leads to a lack of respect toward them. The evidence for this can be 
found in “slut-shaming.”
Constantly, we are judging women by what they 
wear, as if they had some ulterior motive. How many times have you seen fellow peers walking at Midtown with a short skirt and had the word “slut” come to mind?
There is a very negative connotation to the word 
slut because it implies the woman fits the archetype of a sexual temptress and her main goal is to seduce men.
And, of course, as implied by advertisements 
selling a perfume, men will not be able to control themselves when seeing this woman. Because mas-culinity is often associated with violence and pro-miscuity, it is almost as if we are condoning these behaviors. 
There is a “boys will be boys” mentality when-
ever a man gets into a fight or inappropriately com-ments on a woman’s sex appeal. This can be seen in action movies with a hyper-masculine male, televi-sion shows and ads.
Ultimately, this perception leads to a society 
that accepts rape. Too often, women who have been raped are asked what they were wearing, how much they were drinking or if they “led the man on.”
Too often, we wrongfully blame the victim in-
stead of the rapist. The disappointing part is that it has a lot to do with this idea of “slut-shaming,” of making women feel guilty for tempting men with their outfits, while pardoning the men for “just be-ing men.” 
This is the reason why sexual assaults are so 
rarely reported. Most victims of rape feel ashamed, as if it was somehow their fault.
I am aware I focused on the influence of adver -
tisements in this article, but there are many other things that affect our perception of gender.
I believe these issues need to be addressed or 
there will never be progress.

Dance with death
Grant Murray, 24, never went to school. Instead, 
he traveled the country from an early age with his 
parents to Renaissance and circus events. In an 
effort to raise money to build a human cannon to 
launch himself, Murray designed and constructed 
the world’s first wooden wheel of death, a 30-foot 
structure that he must train extensively to use.
Photo Story by Aundre Larrow

in Newberry. Murray’s stage name is Ichabod Wainwright.

It must equal Murray’s weight to keep a consistent momentum.

Atlanta Hawks center Al Horford scored 23 points and grabbed 22 rebounds in a 114-103 victory against the Detroit Pistons on Monday in Detroit. Freshman Sydney Moss has impressed during her ﬁ  rst season under coach Amanda Butler.See story, page 16.◗ FRAZIER II IS OUT UNTIL AT LEAST SATURDAY.
  LANDON WATNICK
 Alligator Writer
   
 The Gators’ depth will be tested 
tonight in Knoxville, Tenn. 
  Guard Michael Frazier II (concus-
sion) will miss No. 8 Florida’s match-
up with Tennessee at 9 p.m., and he is questionable for Saturday’s home contest against Alabama, coach Billy Donovan said Monday . 
    Frazier suffered the head injury 
with 11:42 remaining during UF’s 71-54 victory against Arkansas on Saturday . As he dove for a loose ball, the freshman took a knee to the head from guard Scottie Wilbekin. After remaining face down on the ground for more than a minute, Fra-zier exited to the locker room and did not return. 
  Donovan said Frazier failed some 
of his baseline tests Sunday but should begin light exercise within the next two days once team doctors clear him. 
  Frazier has been Florida’s top 
freshman this year, averaging 6.4 points with a team-best 48.9 per-cent clip from three-point range. The 6-foot-4 Tampa native has also shown prowess as a rebounder, grabbing 3.4 boards in 18.7 minutes per game off the bench. 
  After Frazier sits out Tuesday’s 
game, ﬁ  ve of UF’s eight regular con-tributors will have missed at least one contest this year due to injury.
  “It’s been kind of some strange 
stuff that has happened,” Donovan said. “The one thing that has been good is that our guys have respond-ed. … We’ve just gotten obviously this year a large rash of [injuries].” 
With Frazier out and forward Will Yeguete still inactive after un-dergoing arthroscopic surgery on Feb. 8 to remove bone chips in his right knee, the Gators are left with only six healthy players averaging double-digit minutes this year.
  Donovan will need guard Brax-
ton Ogbueze, forward DeV on Walker and guard Dillon Graham to come off the bench and ﬁ  ll Frazier’s void Tuesday night. All three fresh-men average fewer than 5 minutes per game and normally play during the tail end of routs. 
  The 6-foot-6, 191-pound Walker 
has shot 3 of 19 in 2012-13. 
  Ogbueze has fared better in lim-
ited minutes, averaging 0.9 points

 UF tweaking lineup amid injuries

 Alligator Staff Writer
   
 Daniel Gibson stood behind his teammates as they leaned 
over the dugout railing watching a tie game slip away.
  Gibson allowed a single to the only batter he faced. Run-
ners stood at ﬁ  rst and second in the ninth as Justin Shafer 
jogged from right ﬁ  eld to clean up the mess.
  Gibson clapped his hands.  “Come on ‘J,” he yelled.  The Gators wanted this game. Florida needed it to avoid 
getting swept at home for the ﬁ  rst time in three years.
  Shafer struck out Brooks Beisner and induced a ground 
ball to shortstop Richie Martin off the bat of Michael Suchy.
  Florida’s bullpen had allowed two runs in six innings af-
ter Suchy’s groundout. A small feat for a winning baseball team, but for the struggling Gators, it meant one step closer to victory.
  Coach Kevin O’Sullivan went to his 
closer Johnny Magliozzi in the fourth inning on Sunday. Florida needed a better performance from its middle relief after giving up ﬁ  ve runs in the sixth and seventh innings in Saturday’s 8-3 loss. 
  “We needed to win [on Sunday],” O’Sullivan said. “That 
was the mindset going in. We’re trying to win the ball game.”
  O’Sullivan tabbed Magliozzi early, because the sophomore 
attacks the strike zone.  
  Magliozzi kept the Eagles scoreless until his fourth in-
ning of work. He got two quick outs on deep ﬂ  y balls to left and right ﬁ  eld in the seventh. Beisner then followed a Dwyer single with a game-tying two-run home run off the top of a palm tree in right.
  Shafer suffered a similar fate in his third inning.  Dwyer hit a deﬂ  ating go-ahead three-run shot in the elev-
enth over the right ﬁ  eld scoreboard.
Two swings turned potential redemption into another  Florida relievers

END OF GREGULATION
  Three years into his Florida career, Patric Young remains 
an enigma. 
  Once considered the best big man Billy Donovan has 
ever recruited and a potential one-and-done player, Young has not lived up to expectations. But a starting center putting up 10.3 points and 6.5 rebounds per game obviously isn’t a bust. 
  Young isn’t just an average player, either, because he rare-
ly has an average game. He seems to oscillate between 12-and-12 and 2-and-3 on a nightly basis. 
  While his chiseled physique and freakish athleticism gen-
erate expectations of greatness, his lack of instincts and feel for the game will always hold him back. 
  Watching him play, spectators feel like those mental short-
comings are easily correctable. But maybe asking him to have a better sense of where the rebound will come off is no more fair than asking him to be taller or jump higher — he just can’t do it. 
  Donovan seems to think Young’s 
problem is related to effort, say-ing the difference between his good games and his bad games is “a total choice by him.”
  “As big and strong as he is, there’s 
no reason he shouldn’t demand the ball every single time he gets down 
inside,” Donovan said. “There are times you watch him on ﬁ  lm and there’s no presence there.”
  So is Young lazy? That can’t be it. Everything he’s ever 
said has made him seem like a smart, hard-working, level-headed guy. 
  Lazy people don’t have bodies like Young’s. They don’t 
ﬂ  ip tires and pull trucks during the offseason.  
  Only his 50 percent free-throw shooting suggests a lack of effort, but I haven’t seen him in practice, and I don’t know how he spends his time, so I’m not going to assume he isn’t working hard. 
  Donovan’s other go-to explanation is that Young has been 
limited by foul trouble, but that’s rarely been an issue. Young averages just 3.4 fouls per 40 minutes and has played at least 22 minutes in every game this season. 
  Young appears to be committed to Florida and the process. 
More than any other player, Young’s answers parrot — often word for word — the things Donovan tells his team and the media. 
  But then why is Young facing the same issues he has since 
he ﬁ  rst arrived at UF?
During his freshman year, Young was too focused on the 
expectations. He wanted to score and rebound enough to pre-serve his status as a projected NBA lottery pick.  Junior center limited by inconsistency, lack of instinctsSEE BASEBALL, PAGE 14

twitter: @greglucaHe wanted to play well so badly that he 
became frustrated by his limited role.  He ad-
mitted he was listening to the wrong people. But, after a meeting with Donovan and his assistants, Young said he bought in. He was only interested in running the floor, rebound-ing and playing defense. 
Young had supposedly learned, but dur -
ing his sophomore season, we heard about the same discussions. 
Donovan wanted Young to run the floor, 
rebound and defend. Young wanted to get the ball more. They talked, and Young said he learned. 
“I’m starting to realize the great players 
are the ones who can perform even when they’re not feeling great, and I’m starting to do a lot better job of that,” Young said. “I’ve got to push myself.”
So I have to assume he knows what’s be-
ing asked of him, and I have to assume he’s working hard. Then what’s holding him back? 
He doesn’t have instincts or a feel for the 
game. Even on Saturday, when Donovan ap-plauded his effort, Young played some ter -
rible stretches. With 16:25 remaining the sec-ond half, his attempt at a jumper — which he should never be taking — was blocked.

greg , from page 13 Bullpen has blown lead in four straight games
crushing loss in the series 
finale.
The bullpen has blown a 
lead in each of Florida’s four straight losses. O’Sullivan called for better execution after another subpar perfor -
mance on Saturday.
“You look at the box score. Maybe it’s better, but no,” O’Sullivan said. “We got to throw the ball better. The ball is up in the zone. There were a lot of hard outs.”
As kids finished running 
around the wet base paths after Sunday’s soggy game, the Gators waited to pull the tarp onto the infield. Florida does it after every game.
For once, it seemed like 
a fitting end to a series it would like to forget.
Extra innings create uncer -
tainty: Nine different reliev-
ers made appearances dur -
ing the weekend. O’Sullivan waited until Monday night to announce his decision to start Keenan Kish tonight.
Kish will throw the first 
pitch against North Florida (5-2) tonight at 7 at McK-ethan Stadium. Playing their second game with extra in-nings in a week didn’t make the decision any easier for the Gators (3-5).
Kish, a right-hander, was 
one of two UF hurlers not to throw against Florida Gulf Coast. Kish made his first ca-reer start on Tuesday against UCF in Orlando. He tossed two scoreless innings.

Prather could play center in guard-heavy lineup
on 31.6 percent shooting. Graham is 0 of 8 
from behind the arc. 
“Through foul trouble, substitutions 
and fatigue, we’re going to have to utilize those guys,” Donovan said. “The uncer -
tainty and the unknown is these guys have not really been in situations in the heart and heat of the game to see how they will re-spond. They’re going to get kind of thrust into that [tonight] in Knoxville.”
Due to a shorthanded roster, Donovan 
might experiment with unfamiliar lineups, including a four-guard rotation with 6-foot-6 forward Casey Prather at center. 
“It’s whatever,” Prather said. “I have to 
do it to win. I’m not as big as those guys, but I know my teammates will help me out as far as like helping in the post.” 
Tennessee (16-10, 8-6 Southeastern Con-
ference) has won five straight contests and beat Florida twice last year. The V olunteers defeated the Gators 67-56 last season in Knoxville. 
UT could exploit UF’s rebounding if the 
Gators (22-4, 12-2 SEC) choose to go small.  
The V olunteers are third in the league 
with an average rebounding margin of plus-5.5. Florida has only won the re-bounding battle once in five games since Yeguete’s surgery . 
UT center Jarnell Stokes, a 6-foot-8, 
270-pound bruiser, averages 12.8 points and nine rebounds per game. 
“He’s got a football player body,” center 
Patric Young said. “I just have to hold my ground and stay out of foul trouble.”
Yeguete update: Donovan said Monday 
that Yeguete would be inserted into Thurs-day’s practice “in some shape or form.”
“Whether or not that means he can play 
on Saturday, I don’t know,” Donovan said. “He’s going to start getting into practice, but I don’t know when he’ll be allowed to absorb contact and those kinds of things.”

The Gators’ quest for their first national 
championship is nearing the postseason. 
With Florida three weeks away from 
competing in the 2013 Southeastern Con-
ference Championships in Little Rock on March 23, coach Rhonda Faehn has jug-gled her lineups recently to help ensure the Gators stay healthy and do not peak too soon.
In Florida’s 196.975-196.075 victory 
against No. 23 Kentucky on Friday, Faehn did not have a gymnast compete in all four events for the first time since Feb. 18, 2011.

nasts) in the meet, and that was kind of an interesting dynamic,” Faehn said. “I think part of that was a challenge for those ath-letes when they’re used to being out there quite a bit.”
It was likely the final time Faehn will 
rest her squad given the landscape of the next few weeks.
All-American Ashanee Dickerson was 
withheld from the vault rotation for the first time during her regular-season ca-reer.
Dickerson had competed in 46 consecu-
tive vault events prior to Friday night’s meet. 
Marissa King competed in each rotation 
with the exception of balance beam, where she performed exhibition. King had com-peted all-around in two of the last three meets.  
“I’m really glad that Rhonda did rest 
me this week, because being a senior, I re-ally want to cherish every competition mo-ment I get,” King said.
Without a handful of its strongest com-
petitors performing in each event, UF pro-duced its lowest team score since register -
ing a 196.575 against LSU on Jan. 11. 
Three consecutive miscues on beam 
forced the Gators to count a fall towards their final score of 48.525. 
“It caused a few issues,” Faehn said. 
“But at the same time, they’re tremendous competitors, so they need to know how to do that and learn how to deal with adjust-ments here and there.” 
With the gymnasts given the weekend 
off to recoup, Faehn is certain her team is ready for the postseason.
When Florida travels to face No. 8 Utah 
on March 16 in Salt Lake City for the final regular-season meet of the year, the line-ups should reflect those Faehn will use in both the SEC and NCAA Championships barring injury.  
The Gators are still without All-Ameri-
can Alaina Johnson, who is nursing a low-er-back injury suffered on Jan. 18 against Missouri.
Johnson competed all-around in 10 of 
14 meets in 2012 and was expected to do much of the same this season. 
Faehn met with trainers on Monday to 
discuss the extent of Johnson’s injury. “I believe she is seeing our personal 
trainer and our back specialist,” Faehn said.
“She’s perhaps one more week out, and 
then we’re hoping she’ll be cleared to do some things.”TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 26, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 15

After a disappointing first 
round, Florida saw its outlook 
grow worse in the second round of the John Hayt Collegiate Invi-tational in Ponte Vedra.
The Gators improved from a 
sixth-place tie to a fourth-place tie, but Florida now trails leader UNF by 28 strokes after dropping 12 strokes on Monday.
“Given the conditions today, 
we played better than we did yes-terday,” coach Buddy Alexander said in a release. “We got off to a rough start but made a pretty good comeback.”
Every UF starter struggled 
to shoot below par. Each shot a minimum three-stroke differ -
ence from the first round to the second.
J.D. Tomlinson currently leads 
Florida after shooting a 70 (-2) in the second round and is current-ly tied for ninth. Tomlinson has been the Gators’ most consistent player but still trails Ospreys ju-nior Kevin Phelan by 12 strokes (-13). 
Phelan leads the tournament 
through two rounds.T.J. Vogel, UF’s usual No. 1, 
has struggled since undergoing sports hernia surgery. Vogel shot six shots worse in the second round (75) than he did in the first (69) and is tied for 12th.  
Tyler McCumber has also 
played below his usual standards. He is tied for 31st after shooting a 76 (+4) in the second round.  Mc-Cumber, like Vogel, played worse in the second round, shooting four strokes higher than his first round 72. 
Despite a disappointing day, 
Florida’s two back end starters, Eric Banks and Santiago Gavino, improved. Banks bettered his first-round score of 78 by four strokes (74) to go two over par and jump 14 spots into a tie for 55th. 
Gavino virtually shot himself 
out of contention with an 82 (+10) in the first round but managed to bring his score down to a 79 (+7) in the second.  
Florida’s other participant was freshman A.J. Crouch, who also experienced a disappointing second round.
He dropped five strokes from 
a 71 (-1) in the first round to a 76 (+4) in the second round.  
Florida will wrap up the tour -
nament today in the champion-ship round. 
The UF women’s team return 
to action in the Allstate Sugar Bowl after play was canceled Tuesday due to weather. 
The tournament has been 
shortened to two rounds with the championship round being played today.
UF shoots dismal second round at John Hayt Invitational
� MOSS LEADS FLORIDA WITH 
3.8 ASSISTS PER GAME.

Sydney Moss has been a bright spot in 
Florida’s otherwise gloomy season.
The injury-riddled and inexperienced 
Gators have struggled during Southeast-
ern Conference play , where they are tied for eighth with Arkansas. 
A berth in the NCAA Tournament 
would probably require UF winning the SEC Tournament, an unlikely scenario given the Gators have failed to beat any of the five teams that are atop the confer -
ence.
But moving forward, Moss projects 
to be among the SEC’s elite, a player that Florida could use to ascend in the stand-ings next season. 
“When Sydney plays with a lot of 
command and presence, she is about as talented as anybody in this league,” coach Amanda Butler said. 
“She is so versatile. She can finish, 
shoot the ball well, come off screens, make things happen on defense, and when she rebounds the basketball … the 3 seconds that follow that rebound are probably as special as anyone I’ve ever coached.” 
Known as a proficient scorer coming 
out of high school, Moss has quickly de-veloped more aspects of her game. 
She is 13th in the SEC in rebounding 
during conference play . Her 6.3 boards per game rank third among freshmen. 
But Moss is best at getting her team-
mates involved. She leads UF in assists with 3.8 per contest, which is the second-highest rate among SEC freshmen. Only Missouri guard Lianna Doty averages more, with 4.8 per game. 
“She’s just a ridiculous passer,” Butler 
said.
“She can make passes when she is 
on the perimeter for us that none of our other perimeter players can. Her size and strength and vision and feel for the game, that’s one of the areas that she’s unique on our team.”
Said Kayla Lewis: “She just has some 
abilities that you can’t coach. She has a great feel for the game and makes her teammates better. She makes me look good.” 
Moss’ vision was on display in Flor -
ida’s 67-61 come-from-behind victory at Alabama on Sunday . 
Despite scoring just four points on 
2-of-7 shooting, she stayed productive during the game by accumulating nine assists and six rebounds while logging 27 minutes.  
The freshman guard was particularly 
efficient during the second half, acting as the catalyst for Florida’s largest come-back of the season. 
Trailing 53-40 with 10:36 remaining, 
the Gators scored nine straight points to close the gap.
