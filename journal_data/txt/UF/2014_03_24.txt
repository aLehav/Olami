After a two-month delay, 
UF’s High Ropes and Elements 
Challenge Course was ﬁ  nally christened with the screams and cheers of students and ofﬁ  cials.
Though the course at UF’s 
Lake Wauburg, about 15 miles 
south of campus, has been open 
since January, the grand opening was postponed until Friday due to inclement weather.
Carlos Gordian, a 22-year-old 
UF material science and engi-
neering senior, was tasked with 
cutting the ceremonial rope for his part in the project as a chair-
man of the board of directors for 
RecSports.
After the ceremony, Vice Pres-
ident of Student Affairs Dave 
Kratzer climbed cargo nets to the 
third tier. 
Then, he soared across a 40-
foot-high, 225-foot-long zip line.
Michelle Alexander, coordina-
tor for parks and outdoor recre-ation, said the course can be use-ful for teambuilding and teaching life lessons, even when climbers 
lose their footing.
“The interesting thing is 
watching the light bulbs pop on 
for people,” she said. “Because in life and everything we do, there’s 
going to be those moments where 
somebody stumbles.”
The 21-element obstacle 
course is free for UF students 
during Spring and Fall semesters 
on weekends. 
Students must make reserva-
tions for groups of 12 to 36 peo-ple.
Non-UF groups can make 
reservations to use the course for $30 to $75, depending on the challenges requested.VOLUME 108 ISSUE 121 WWW.ALLIGATOR.ORG MONDAY, MARCH 24, 2014

The ﬁ  ght to ﬁ  ll growlers to the half-
gallon mark is still underway in Flori-
da. But while current bills are moving through state government, craft beer brewers are losing their spirits about the 
legal size of containers they can sell. 
A growler is a portable, reusable jug 
that is ﬁ  lled with beer, usually from craft 
breweries. They can be legally sold in Florida in 32-ounce and 128-ounce con-tainers. 
However, it is illegal to sell any con-
tainer size in between, prohibiting the 64-ounce growler, an industry standard 
that is the preferred size in the 47 other 
states where it is legal.
Because Florida operates on a three-
tier brewing system, brewers are re-quired to sell to distributors ﬁ  rst, who are then allowed to sell beer to consum-ers. Growlers act as a legal way for brew-
eries to sell directly to their consumers 
without the middleman.
Ben Radich, the store manager of 
Tipple’s Brews, said because growlers don’t have long shelf lives and lose car-bonation, the 64-ounce jug is the perfect size to share — the main reason it is pre-ferred.  
“It’s basically two beers for two peo-
ple,” he said. “It’s the feasible amount of beer for the lifespan of a growler.”
Radich said the law that prohibits 
half-gallon growlers is “antiquated” and left over from the Prohibition era.
“It seems kind of silly,” he said. “You 
can get two quarts ﬁ  lled, but you can’t Brewers still battling state

Bee researchers are abuzz over the possibil-
ity of a new bee research facility at UF.
The Florida State Beekeepers Association 
has asked for $3.5 million in legislative fund-
ing to hopefully create the largest honeybee 
research facility in the southeast.
As part of the Florida beekeepers mission to 
make Florida a national leader in bee research, 
the facility will focus on honeybee husbandry, biodiversity, ecology and integrated crop pol-lination.   
James “Jamie” D. Ellis Jr., UF associate pro-
fessor of entomology, said the facility would put UF in a better position to receive national 
grants and visits from international research-
ers.
“We have the ability to impact the national 
beekeeping scene here in our state,” he said. “Beekeepers recognize that, and they’re lob-bying so hard to make this a premier place to do beekeeping instruction.”
Gainesville resident and state Rep. Keith 
Perry requested that Florida TaxWatch, an 
independent taxpayer research institute, per-
form an economic evaluation on the proposed facility to “determine the potential return for the state of Florida and its taxpayers.”
The report, completed by TaxWatch, con-
cluded the facility will increase tax revenue to more than $1 million, reduce beekeeping costs and provide beneﬁ  ts to agriculture produc-ers.
A laboratory inside the facility will be used 
for research and for teaching. According to the report, the laboratory would have “a hive State beekeepers ask for money

A canvas hung outside the din-
ing hall. 
In the morning, it was a solid 
blue bed sheet, but by evening, it 
was a piece of artwork that included 
three dolphins, two alien invasions 
and a sunset over the ocean.
Paul Wislotski, 54, spent the 
weekend outside Gator Corner Din-ing Center, offering oil pastels and blank bed sheets to passers-by.
Wislotski, who drives cabs when 
he’s home in Largo, Fla., spent three days at UF this weekend as a part of his two-year university tour.
Though many professed a lack 
of artistic ability, Wislotski eventu-ally convinced about 200 students to cover two blue sheets with colors, designs and animals.
“C’mon, put your personality up 
here,” Wislotski said to one reluctant student. “Don’t think, just go.”
The rules were simple: No words 
or symbols, and don’t cover anyone else’s artwork.He’s displayed what he calls 
“collective art” in each of the 50 state capitals. Now, he said, he hopes to hitchhike his way to at least two uni-
versities in each state.
Wislotski said he set up his first 
collective art piece in 1994 during 
the 25th anniversary of Woodstock. After setting up easels in small towns outside the 1996 Olympics, he decided he wanted to bring the art across the country. Eventually, he found his way to UF.
“About a year ago, I got to think-
ing universities would be a good place to bring this message to young people,” said Wislotski. 
Melissa Lore, a 19-year-old UF 
pharmacy freshman, was coaxed to contribute to the project Sunday af-ternoon.
“It’s cool to add — not necessar-
ily draw your own thing — but add-ing to others,” she said.
Though Wislotski openly said he 
shared the art “to lift up to Jesus” as part of his work as a Christian mis-sionary, he said bringing his idea of collective art to young people and their families was equally impor-tant.
“I want young people to know 
that their voices can be heard,” said Wislotski. MONDAY, MARCH 24, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 3

Gainesville Police watched out for two men who it said 
swiped cash and green silk lingerie from the French Addic-tion boutique near downtown. One of the robbers forced an employee into the bathroom at gunpoint. The duo stole $68 
in cash and two sets of camisole and tap pants. “I guess they 
wanted to get something for their old ladies,” an employee said.  
March 23, 2001Gators wide receiver Jabar Gaffney subdued a 15-year-old 
who was trying to steal his scooter, according to University Police. The alleged thief and another minor had previously stolen scooters from the same area near the Lakeside Com-
plex. Gaffney held one of the kids until police arrived, and the 
other was caught on a stolen bike shortly after the incident. The football player told police that he just didn’t want the two to leave the scene.

Gun advocacy group Florida Carry pledged in December to 
sue any state college that didn’t allow guns to be stored in vehi-
cles on campus — and three months later, it’s kept its promise.
Florida’s First District Court of Appeals ruled in 2013 that 
state campuses couldn’t prohibit people from bringing guns 
on campus in their vehicles following a lawsuit against the University of North Florida. The group has sued three colleges 
since the decision — two have amended or are in the process of amending their policies, and UF is in the early stages of a legal battle.
The group filed a lawsuit against UF in January over its 
campus firearm policies, and the two parties are waiting for a case management hearing in April to set the schedule for the court meetings to come.
UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes wrote in an email that the 
university filed a motion to dismiss, and Florida Carry has amended its complaint.“Now we are reviewing and preparing our response,” Sikes 
said.
Sean Caranna, executive director of Florida Carry, said re-
gardless of the court’s decision, he expects the case to go to the 
appellate court.
“We’re totally prepared for that,” he said.
In February, Florida Carry sued Eastern Florida State Col-
lege and St. Petersburg College. The first amended its policies four days after the lawsuit was filed, and Caranna said the sec-ond sent Florida Carry a draft of its amended policies to be in compliance with the law.Florida Carry, UF standoff over campus gun rules continues

ATHENA HARRIS
Alligator Contributing Writer
Laura Harmon started harm-
ing herself during her freshman 
year because of stress and depres-
sion.
“Last year I changed majors. I 
had no idea what I was doing. It 
was so overwhelming,” said Har-
mon,  a 20-year-old UF wildlife ecology sophomore. “By the time 
I knew about the resources on 
campus, I was already too far into 
it to go for help.” 
March is Self-Harm Awareness 
Month, and for UF students con-
sidering harmful actions, Harmon said she recommends they seek 
help from the resources found on 
campus.  
Self-harm is an issue that af-
fects the entire community, said 
UPD spokesman Maj. Brad Bar-
ber. In his 18 years with Univer-
sity Police, Barber said he’s seen 
an overall rise in the number of 
self-harm incidents.
Between 2012 and 2013, there 
were more than 230 self-harm situations that resulted in police intervention and potentially more that were never reported, Barber 
said.  
But these numbers might be 
starting to decrease with the use of resources on campus as well 
as crisis intervention training for UPD officers, he said.
“If you are one of those seek-
ing help or feel like you are in 
this type of situation, please reach 
out,” Barber said. “Contact some-
one who can provide you with the 
resources you need.” 
These include the U Matter, We 
Care program and the Counseling 
& Wellness Center.
The center is a resource that 
offers individual counseling and  group sessions to help students 
build stress tolerance and find 
healthier mechanisms for dealing 
with problems, said Ju-Ri Joeng, a 
psychology intern at the wellness center.
What motivates people to harm 
themselves varies, she said. Some 
people never had the chance to 
develop healthy coping strategies, and some received attention or 
other reinforcement to lead them to it. 
“We try to do our very best 
to have every student meet their needs here,” Joeng said.
In the initial counseling meet-
ing, students discuss confidenti-
ality with their counselors before 
personal information or stories 
are shared, Joeng said. 
But simply having a friend to 
talk to can make all the differ-ence for self-harming students, 
Harmon said, especially because 
it can be intimidating to talk to 
counselors. 
That was true for Harmon, who 
said  a good friend helped her 
through by suggesting healthier 
alternatives to stress-relieving. 
Harmon no longer hurts her-
self.
“Just give different options, 
and don’t be confrontational,” Jo-eng said.Gators raise self-harm awareness“Don’t think, just go.”

UPD spokesmanfill one vessel with that equal amount.”
Mike Halker, the president of the Florida Brew-
ers Guild, an organization that advocates for craft 
beer and the rights of craft breweries, agreed. He said the 64-ounce growler is the “Goldilocks 
size.”
When the law was set in place for container 
size, growlers weren’t a consideration, Halker 
said. It was mostly set in motion to control the market so that certain companies wouldn’t be al-lowed to sell popular beers in alternate container sizes. This is also the reason 40-ounce beers are il-legal in Florida.
Andy Bielecki, the bar manager of local Swamp 
Head brewery, said he is “cautiously optimistic” about the bills moving through state government.
“It’s a little frustrating that we’re not in line 
with the rest of the nation,” he said. “We’ve seen this in the past … We’re holding our breath to see what’s going to happen.”
Halker said Florida’s system is outdated. De-
spite the guild’s efforts to change the law to allow half-gallon growlers, controversy remains preva-
lent.In a recent article from the Associated Press, 
Florida Senate President Don Gaetz said he sup-
ports whatever beer policies his friend Lewis Bear, an Anheuser-Busch InBev distributor, advises him to support.
This time, it is to ensure that 64-ounce growlers 
remain illegal.
Bielecki said he’s frustrated with Gaetz because 
he isn’t fully informed. To combat that, some breweries are spearheading campaigns to help 
him understand the brewers’ side.
“I’m hoping that he will listen,” Bielecki said.
Halker said he is “disgusted” because Gaetz 
doesn’t care or understand what he’s voting on. Instead, he’s simply supporting his friend’s cause.  
“Now we have this gigantic opposition in Tal-
lahassee,” he said.  
Halker said that while the Florida Beer Whole-
salers Association cites overconsumption as one of 
the main reasons it doesn’t support the legal sale 
of half-gallon containers, it doesn’t make sense be-cause brewers are allowed to sell gallon growlers. 
“We can’t get a good reason from them because 
there is no good reason,” he said. “Whatever an-swers they give don’t make any sense — they’re just going to keep their foot on us.”viewing area, so students and visi-tors can watch live beehives in ac-tion.”  
Chappie McChesney, local 
beekeeper and founder of North Central Florida Beekeepers As-sociation, said although UF bee researchers are top notch, they’re 
in need of a new facility with new 
equipment.
“They don’t have enough room 
to work,”  he said.
Unlike other universities with 
bee programs, UF would be able to complete bee research year-round because Florida serves as a winter nursery for bees migrating away 
from colder weather.
According to the USDA, in 2012 
there were about 199,000 honey-
producing colonies in Florida, but bee colonies have been declining due to colony collapse disorder. This so-far unexplained phenom-ena of bee disappearances is an is-sue the facility plans to research.
Tom Nolan, president of the 
Florida State Beekeepers Associa-tion, said Florida beekeepers are excited to see how the facility will help improve beekeeping in Flor-ida.
“We have a vulnerable situ-
ation in the state of Florida,” he 
said. “We’ve finally hit the point 
where we can’t wait any longer for increased research on the problems of honeybees.”4, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, MARCH 24, 2014

Jaime Hinckson speaks to the audience between songs at Rockeys Dueling Piano Bar on Sunday. He 
said he likes that people can enjoy his music and interpret it however they choose.
MELISSA MIHM

To promote his first debut al-
bum, “Take Flight,” Jaime Hinck-
son and his band showcased their talents at Rockeys Dueling Piano Bar on Sunday.
Where the air was equally filled 
with Caribbean beats as it was with the smell of Jamaican jerk chicken, Hinckson’s long fingers danced across the Yamaha electric grand piano as his band followed along.
The 25-year-old Miami native 
has had a passion for music since age 7, when he first learned how to 
play classical music on the piano.
“I thought it was the most bor-
ing music on the planet,” he said. 
He then shifted to jazz when 
he was about 12 and describes his music as “reggae jazz,” remaining closely tied to his parents’ Carib-
bean roots.
To a crowd of about 100, 
Hinckson played Bob Marley cov-ers along with some of his origi-nal songs, including “Miss Mac,” a song about the woman who initially sparked his musical inter-
est.

PERTH, Australia — Six Australian planes 
took off Saturday for a third day of scouring 
the desolate southern Indian Ocean for pos-sible parts of missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, now lost for two full weeks.
Australia promised its best efforts to re-
solve the mystery, but two days of searching the seas about 2,500 kilometers southwest of Perth have not produced any evidence.
A satellite spotted two large objects in the 
area earlier this week, raising hopes of finding the Boeing 777 that disappeared March 8 with 239 people on board.
Australia’s Acting Prime Minister Warren 
Truss told reporters in Perth on Saturday that “so far, there have been no findings of note.”“It is a very remote area, but we intend to 
continue the search until we’re absolutely sat-
isfied that further searching would be futile — 
and that day is not in sight,” he said.
Bad weather hindered Friday’s search, 
but conditions in the southern Indian Ocean improved Saturday, Prime Minister Tony Ab-bott said in Papua New Guinea. He said six aircrafts were in the area with an Australian naval vessel on the way.
The aircraft included two ultra long-range 
commercial jets and four P-3 Orions, the Aus-tralian Maritime Safety Authority said.
AMSA officials also were checking to see if 
there was any new satellite imagery that could provide more information. The satellite im-ages were taken March 16, but the search in the area did not start until Thursday because it took time to analyze them.
In Kuala Lumpur, where the Flight 370 
plane took off for Beijing, Malaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein called the process “a long haul” as he thanked the more than two dozen countries involved in a search that stretches from Kazakhstan in Central Asia to the southern Indian Ocean. 
The Telegraph newspaper in London car-ried a report showing a transcript of the con-versation between the pilots and traffic control 
before the plane disappeared. The paper said 
it may have been noteworthy because one of the pilots repeated his altitude about the same time a transponder was turned off.
Peter Marosszeky, an aviation expert at the 
University of New South Wales in Australia, cautioned against reading too much into the transcript as pilots occasionally repeat them-selves.
“I’ve sat through many thousands of flights 
myself, and it’s not something that would re-ally strike me as unusual,” he said.
Without being able to hear the inflection 
in the pilots’ voices, it’s very difficult to deter-mine whether anything said is truly notewor-thy, he added.

Normally Wes Cooper has a 
four-step process to drinking beer: 
look, smell, agitate, taste.
But on Saturday, the Burkhardt 
Brewing Co. craft beer manager wasn’t concerned with formality or explaining which brew pairs best 
with certain dishes. He was work-
ing to make sure everyone at the 17th Greater Gator Beer Festival tasted the range of beers his com-pany makes.
Hundreds of beer lovers walked 
circles around Magnolia Park in Northwest Gainesville to drink the 100-plus craft beers available to 
sample at the festival. Some walked 
around with a chicken wing in one hand and a beer in the other. Others danced with strangers, influenced by high-gravity suds.
Cooper said the purpose of 
the festival is for beer lovers to be around others who enjoy the drink.
“The experience isn’t to get 
drunk,” he said. “It’s to taste the beer.”
Cooper brought along a hard 
cider called Johnny Appleseed that doesn’t hit the market until April 7. 
A few tasters said they will be first in 
line to buy a case of the sweet bever-age when it’s officially released.
The event’s coordinator, Ricki Black, said the festival almost didn’t 
happen this year, which would have 
been the second consecutive year of its absence in Gainesville. She was 
concerned about this year’s turnout 
because she said the city didn’t offi-cially approve the beer festival until 
Tuesday.
“From then until now, we put this together,” she said.
The late approval coupled with 
the men’s Gators basketball game on 
Saturday influenced the low turn-out, Black said, but nobody seemed 
to notice.
About 35 vendors came out and 
set up tables to display their beers. 
Everything was poured from bottles only, some of which were displayed 
in a row. Each person got a 2-ounce 
pour — double the size of an aver-age shot — equaling one big swish or a couple classy sips. Food and 
drinks were unlimited, and a cigar 
bar was set up for smokers.
First-time festival attendee Anto-
nio Gil, 67, said he came out because his son bought a couple of tickets.
A 20-year Gainesville resident, 
Gil said he was just going down the line of vendors and trying some of everything. 
He said he prefers darker beers, 
and his favorite one so far was the Gladiator porter, so dark that sun-light couldn’t shine through the glass. 
However, some preferred old fa-
vorites.
After walking around the ven-
dors, festivalgoer Marc Garnett said 
he’s sticking to his Samuel Adams 
Boston Lager.
“We’ve done four laps,” Garnett 
said. “Gainesville needs a lot more of this.”MONDAY, MARCH 24, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 5

ST. PETERSBURG — Six 
months after a Florida teen asked 
a church full of strangers to help him find a real home, he still has not been adopted.
Davion Navar Henry Only’s 
plea was first reported by the Tampa Bay Times and was then featured in news outlets around the world. He stood at the pulpit of a church in September, wear-ing a donated suit and clutching a Bible he’d borrowed from his boys home.
“My name is Davion,” he said. 
“And I’ve been in foster care since I was born.”
Davion told the church he 
never knew his real family and he hoped for a home.
He was featured on “Good 
Morning America,” on “Al Jazeera America” and in People. Produc-ers flew him in to speak with Barbara Walters in New York on “The View.” About 10,000 people 
around the globe called to ask 
about helping or adopting him.
Davion has since moved out 
of a group home and into a fos-ter one, the Times reports. But he still does not have a permanent home.
“Something doesn’t seem right. I pray about it,” said his mentor, Richard Prince, 22. “He’s changed schools and foster homes, and he’s not allowed to tell me cer-
tain things. People want to hear 
a happy ending, but it’s not too clear what’s going on.”
More than 300 people contact-
ed the Times last fall saying they couldn’t get in touch with anyone at Davion’s foster agency, Eckerd. The Times contacted a sample of 40 of those potential parents. Of the 10 who responded, nine said they had not heard from Eckerd.
An Eckerd spokeswoman said 
Davion was meeting with pro-spective adoptive families and that the process would take time.
Some adoptions experts say 
they are not surprised that an adoption has taken so long, but other children’s advocates are ap-palled.

Gainesville Police arrested two Mas-
sachusetts men after a traffic stop turned 
up 16 grams of cocaine, 9 grams of mari-juana and two digital scales.
Officers arrested 
40-year-old Reginald 
Presell Goodman and 21-year-old Andre L. Gerhardt on charges of cocaine possession, marijuana possession and drug equipment possession, among other charges.
At about 11:30 p.m., an officer noticed 
a silver Chevrolet sedan driven by Good-man weaving lanes on Northeast Waldo Road. It made a sudden turn onto North-east 15th Street, according to the report.The officer, driving behind him, no-
ticed what looked like the men passing something back and forth, according to 
the report.
At the traffic stop, Gerhardt had two 
open cans of Bud Light beer in his hands, 
and the car smelled of marijuana, accord-ing to the report. 
The officer searched Goodman and 
found $2,028 as well as 16.2 grams of co-caine, worth about $800.
A search of the car revealed the 9 
grams of weed and a marijuana grinder in the glove box. Two scales with cocaine residue were in the trunk, according to the report. During questioning, both men told the officer they didn’t want to talk about it.
Officers booked them into the Alach-
ua County Jail at about 1:15 a.m., where they both remained as of press time. Driver arrested with cocaine
� HER RESEARCH HELPS SCREEN 
HORSES FOR DISEASES. 
MEGAN STENNES
Alligator Contributing Writer
When it comes to breeding foals, a UF re-
searcher isn’t horsing around.
Samantha Brooks, a UF assistant profes-
sor in the Department of Animal Sciences, is 
studying horse genetics to better predict the 
results of breeding pairs.
Brooks said her research focuses on horse 
genomes. She said she’s “looking at genomes 
from very diverse horses to catalog the differ-ences.”
Currently, she said, she’s looking at two 
rare neurological conditions. One causes seizures and nervous system degeneration, and the other leads to inflammation in horse hooves.
Brooks’ research is used in horse DNA 
testing that screens for certain traits and dis-eases.
This has a real impact on breeders because 
they know more about the animals they’re buying, Brooks said.
“Breeders use the tests to determine if the 
stallion or mare carries the disease,” Brooks said. “That way when they choose to breed, they can avoid producing a sick foal.”
Lee Ann Selkowitz, owner and trainer at 
Twin Oaks Stables in High Springs, said the research can help reduce the number of hors-es that don’t pass breeding standards.
“If you could go in and see what was there, 
it would reduce the load on rescue and horses that are doomed to never really do anything,” she said.UF researcher helps horse

on tuition equity 
hypocritical
Those championing tuition equity in Florida made large 
strides Thursday: The Florida House passed a bill extend-ing in-state tuition rates to undocumented students. 
The bill, quite simply, makes sense. If you’re a student who 
has attended all four years of high school in the state of Florida, 
why wouldn’t you pay in-state tuition? Moreover, as Florida Rep. 
Janet Cruz, D-Tampa, said, “In this Sunshine State, opportunity should shine brightest.” Cruz is one of the many politicians and activists in Florida pushing for the rights of undocumented stu-dents to include affordable higher education. 
The debate over tuition equity has been building for decades, 
the Miami Herald reported. It’s been brought to the forefront of Florida politics by House Speaker Will Weatherford, R-Wesley Chapel, on the state level and by student activists on the uni-
versity level. UF is one of a handful of universities pushing its 
trustees to grant partial-tuition waivers to undocumented stu-dents, as Florida International University and Miami Dade Col-lege have done. 
As the issue has pressed on, all eyes turned toward Gov. Rick 
Scott to see where he would stand on tuition equity. The conser-vative governor has taken hard stances on immigration policies before: The Herald reported that Scott vetoed a bill last year that would have allowed some children of undocumented immi-
grants to obtain temporary driver’s licenses. The bill had nearly 
unanimous support before Scott rejected it, which shows his at-titude toward rights for children of undocumented immigrants. 
His sudden support of tuition equity, then, smacks of voter 
pandering. 
According to the Herald, Florida Democratic Party Chair-
woman Allison Tant said, “For three years, Rick Scott hasn’t been treating young undocumented immigrants like people — now he’s treating them like political pawns.”
Despite the transparency of Scott’s support of tuition equity, 
the passage of this bill would signify a turning point in Florid-ian immigration policy. The conservative nightmare of undocu-mented students yanking the rug from beneath American-born youth is far from a reality. Undocumented immigrants tend to take on jobs that don’t require Social Security numbers, such as farming and construction. In fact, our country’s agricultural system relies on the cheap labor of undocumented workers. De-nying education and a chance at upward mobility for the chil-
dren of those workers, who continue to prop up our economy, 
is criminal.
Obviously, Florida has a large Hispanic voter community, 
especially in South Florida — hence FIU and Miami Dade Col-lege’s partial-tuition waiver policies for undocumented students. Scott’s attempt to entice voters in the coming election season won’t go unnoticed by the communities he’s trying to win over. After all, why would you vote for the politician who allows you in-state tuition but not the privilege of a temporary driver’s li-
cense? 
The governor’s motives are clear, and they’re anything but 
pure.Tinder love: Minimum effort, max results
I have a confession to make — I have a Tinder account.
Despite being around for more than a year, Tinder 
remains relevant. And judging by the number of peo-
ple I ﬁ  nd on it, it’s thriving.
For those who don’t know what Tinder is, the app pulls 
users’ Facebook information to create a proﬁ  le. Users can 
then add a few pictures and a short description of them-selves.
Now comes the fun part. The app searches for Tinderers 
in your area and brings up their proﬁ  les. You swipe left for “Please get away from me,” and right for “Helllooooo.”
If both users swipe right for each other, Tinder sends 
each of them an alert. They can then message each other and do, well, whatever it is people use Tinder for.
Theoretically, you can be Tinder-ing in your pajamas 
at home, get a match, message them “Drinks at Mid?” and then, as long as both parties consent, have them at your place in a few hours.
Minimum effort, maximum results.However, what I ﬁ  nd most interesting about Tinder 
is that it’s very hard for people to admit they have one. There’s usually some amount of staring at the ﬂ  oor and mumbling an excuse for why they downloaded the app before they’ll actually admit to it.
“My friend downloaded it,” “I just got it as a joke to 
mess around with people,” and “I only have it so I can write a column about it,” are my favorites.
I’ve seen a large number of UF Tinder users, so don’t 
hold your head down in shame. You’re not the only one who wants to meet hot singles in your area.
You’re on a higher level than your friends, too. You can 
get a match in mere minutes while your friends still have to go through the long process of meeting people in real life. Face-to-face conversation? What is this — the stone age?
Seriously, though, Internet dating of any kind, whether 
it be OkCupid, Match.com or Tinder, is becoming so main-stream that there’s no reason to be coy about owning accounts on the sites.
It’s convenient, it’s fun, and it 
connects me with people I never would have met in person. So in my eyes, I give it a 10 out of 10 and would recommend it.
It’s important to note that 
there are some tips to make your 
Tinder experience a little more pleasant and successful.
In my time on Tinder, I’ve noticed a few unspoken 
rules. If you identify as a female, you must have the req-uisite bikini picture. If you’re a guy, one of your pictures should include a cute animal. Bonus points if it’s a lion or a tiger.
If you’re a male who is taller than 6 feet, you must have 
that in your Tinder description. If you are less than a 7 out of 10, make sure your proﬁ  le picture is of you with an at-tractive friend.
If you follow any of those, you’ll ﬁ  t right in with the 
Tinder community.
But in terms of standing out on Tinder, it all comes 
down to your description. I’m not saying a good body or pretty face isn’t nice, but I swipe right on almost anybody with a paragraph that makes me laugh.
Get creative and make it a talking point. For example, 
mine says that I make great banana bread and that I was voted “most likely to be president” in middle school. I rec-ommend you add fun facts like that to your description.
It gives your proﬁ  le a little personality and makes it 
easier for matches to start a conversation because they al-ready know a little bit about you.  
So if you’re wondering if my Tinder use has paid off, 
well, a lady never Tinders and tells.

By this point in Barack 
Obama’s presidency, both he and his admin-
istration have been called almost every offensive name 
imaginable. However, the 
continued trend of compar-ing Obama, his administra-tion and the federal govern-ment to the Nazis among the right wing is so foul, disgust-ing and baseless that it’s time someone shouted from the mountaintops.
Although one can disagree 
with the president, his poli-cies and those in government, it’s an entirely different situ-ation when you compare the Affordable Care Act to acts that led to the murder of mil-lions of innocent people.  
Sadly, few castigate those 
on the right for their insane and downright offensive com-parisons, and it’s a shame. We live in a country that prides itself on free speech, and boy, do folks like Rush Limbaugh, Ted Nugent and other like-minded, pathetic windbags take advantage of that free-
dom. Just because we have 
the freedom of speech does not mean we can’t criticize those who make purely of-fensive allegations because they disagree politically with the U.S. government.
Ben Carson, a harsh critic 
of the Affordable Care Act 
and contributor to Fox News, 
recently stated that the Unit-ed States is “very much like Nazi Germany.”
How so, Carson? Is it be-
cause there’s a law that’s pro-viding millions of previously uninsured Americans with affordable health insurance, 
and that’s somehow the same 
as the policies of the Nazis?
Perhaps we should invent 
a time machine and send these right-wing pundits back to Germany in the 1930s or Poland in late 1939 into the early 1940s. Maybe they’ll arrive just as the Nazis de-
stroyed Jewish-owned busi-
nesses on Kristallnacht, or maybe they’ll witness the liq-uidation of the Krakow Ghet-to, as thousands upon thou-sands of Jews were rounded up and sent to concentration camps.
If America were really be-
coming more like Nazi Ger-many, as a Jew, perhaps I should be a bit worried. But you know what? I’m not. A mandate to get health insur-ance doesn’t even come close to the terror that millions felt under the iron ﬁ  st of Adolf Hitler and his genocide-com-
mitting goons.We can disagree vehe-
mently with Obama and his 
policies, but we should never come to the conclusion that the U.S. — home of the free — is somehow turning into 
Nazi Germany. When we let 
talking heads get away with comparing the government to the Nazis, the claim is base-less and offensive, and it ul-timately makes the American government look tyrannical and in need of a coup.
How would World War II 
veterans — some who sacri-ﬁ  ced everything — feel about you comparing the U.S. gov-ernment to the government they fought so hard to de-feat? So many landed at the beaches of Normandy and 
sacriﬁ  ced it all to defeat pure 
evil. The current occupant at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. is hardly a tyrant and hardly needs thousands of Ameri-can troops landing along the Atlantic seaboard to defeat him.
If we are going to com-
pare any world leader to Hitler and his Nazi stooges, wouldn’t Syrian President Bashar al-Assad be a better choice?
Throughout the civil 
war that’s devastating Syria and its people, an estimat-
ed 140,000-plus people are 
dead as a result of the ﬁ  ght-ing. Assad’s regime has been accused of using chemical weapons on its own people, killing women and children, and ruling with an iron ﬁ  st.
Despite Assad’s cruelty, 
the 140,000 lives lost in Syria 
pales in comparison to the 12 
million innocent people who died as the result of the Ho-locaust.
Nothing and no one com-
pares to what Hitler imposed 
on millions of innocent peo-
ple. Nothing.
The Nazi comparisons are 
wrong, and the right wing knows it. For the good of our country and out of respect for the presidency and the mem-ories of those who sacriﬁ  ced their lives during World War 
II and the Holocaust, this 
trend needs to end.

North Florida is home to 
the largest assemblage of artesian springs in the 
U.S. From Wakulla Springs near Florida State University, Ichetuck-
nee Springs near UF, Wekiwa and 
Rock springs near the University of Central Florida and Weeki Wachee Springs near the University of South Florida, Florida’s adventurous col-lege students know the springs are perhaps the best-kept secret to sur-
viving the three-season heat and 
humidity typical of Florida and for ﬁ  nding a refreshing alternative to crowded beaches. 
Springs are perhaps the closest 
students can come to experiencing the real Florida: the land originally inhabited by the ﬁ  rst people and subsequently conquered by the con-
quistadores searching for gold and 
proﬁ  t.  
To early residents of the state and 
for many of today’s generation who are thoughtful about treating our be-leaguered environment with more respect, springs are held to be sacred and ﬁ  lled with magic. 
What’s more amazing than walk-
ing through a dry woodland with no sign of surface water to sustain 
life and then stepping into a dense green oasis of plants and wildlife 
with a sparkling azure liquid eye staring skyward from deep inside 
the Earth? 
Before the advent of bottled 
spring water, springs were the foun-
tains of life — a site of perpetual water bounty beyond the capability of human imagination. Springs pro-vide a chance to not only drink that nourishing water, but also to dive in and see an underwater world of plants and ﬁ  sh living in natural har-
mony. For those who are even more 
adventurous, springs offer a por-tal into the underworld of ﬂ  owing groundwater rivers, blind cave cray-ﬁ  sh, the bones of extinct megafauna and, when the dive light is shut off, a darkness that must be experienced to be believed.
As with all parts of the formerly 
untainted environment we share with nature, springs are also being harmed and are losing their pristine water quality, their life-nourishing ﬂ  ows and the plants and wildlife that were once so abundant. It is for this reason that the UF 
chapter of the American Water Re-sources Association is partnering with the Howard T. Odum Florida Springs Institute to raise the aware-
ness of college students about the 
challenges facing healthy springs. There is still time enough to turn the tide of the loss of water quality and quantity at North Florida’s springs. 
But the task is large, and the 
Springs Institute and its partners 
are very keen on educating and en-
gaging young adults in this impor-tant effort. The Silver Springs and Ichetucknee Springs that existed when I was in college at UF nearly 40 years ago no longer exist. They cannot be found, but they can be re-stored. 
You can take a part in this im-
portant effort of preserving our heri-tage. “Give Springs a Break” and join us at Ginnie Springs Outdoors for a weekend of spring immersions from April 4 through 6. 
Visit the Springs Institute web-
site, ﬂ  oridaspringsinstitute.org, to register for this unique educational spring’s break.

Speaking OutUndergrads should not be al-
lowed in the law school library.
Bold? Maybe. Unpopular? 
Deﬁ  nitely, considering that UF is pri-marily an undergraduate institution. This is not a statement I make lightly.
But here in the law school, we only have ﬁ  nals 
once per semester. There are no midterms and no extra credit. We need the lawbrary — and an Olympic pool-sized supply of coffee and Red Bull — because everything’s riding on ﬁ  nals week.
The problem is, undergrads often have ﬁ  nals 
around the same time as law students. So right when law students need a quiet library the most is when the squawking ﬂ  ocks of undergrads inhabit its every corner, taking up space, ﬁ  lling the park-ing lot with scooters and walking up and down the aisles looking for empty seats. 
I understand the lawbrary has a reputation as a 
quiet place to study. Unfortunately, when droves of undergrads — clad in tank tops and clutching iced coffees — descend upon the lawbrary, silence becomes a myth that makes a law-school 4.0 seem attainable by comparison.
The unwanted visitors may feel their exag-
gerated stage whispers are sufﬁ  ciently silent, but when hordes of undergrads mass in the lawbrary hissing gossip, it sounds like a thousand scream-ing demons rising from the depths of hell to our stressed-out ears.
For the law students trying to wade through 
endless Scalia dissents, each cough feels like the blow of a ball-peen hammer. Pro tip: If you’ve re-cently been diagnosed with tuberculosis, please feel free to study at home.
The many cellphones, set to silent but vibrating 
vigorously throughout the study area, are like tiny jackhammers disrupting the smooth pavement of my concentration. If you don’t understand that turning off your ringtone doesn’t suf-ﬁ  ciently silence your phone, I’m afraid that no amount of studying will help you sprout some common sense.  
No matter how quiet they are, it’s 
not hard to spot the usurpers. The neon 
red, blue and green of class cheat sheets unmistak-ably distinguish the undergrads from the library’s rightful inhabitants. True law students yearn for the days when the keys to any class could simply be bought from a storefront in Midtown. But that simply adds to the resentment we feel when we see the disciples of Study Edge spreading their gospel in our lawyerly sanctuary.
And the bathrooms after the undergrads have 
passed through? It’s as if some enterprising un-dergrad ﬁ  lled a spackling bucket with rotten eggs, Cantina ﬁ  sh bowls, Italian Gator pizza and several strands of used toilet paper, then dumped it on the bathroom ﬂ  oor and left it to fester for a weekend. The horrors are unspeakable.
Since there’s really nothing we can do, law stu-
dents are forced to glare meaningfully at the en-croaching undergrads. 
“She doesn’t even go here!” is a common re-
frain. 
Perhaps it’s unfair to suggest that all under-
grads be banned from the lawbrary. It’s likely just a few people who are responsible, so why punish everybody? I agree. If everyone could dredge up the amount of self-control necessary to maintain a peaceful study environment, I would have no com-plaint. 
Since we don’t make the rules, these problems 
will no doubt continue. 
But next time you decide to have a 20-minute 
conversation in the lawbrary, you’ll know why law students always look so angry.

Point guard Scottie Wilbekin dribbles the ball out from under an opposing player during Florida’s 61-45 win against Pittsburgh on Saturday.

ORLANDO — After Scot-
tie Wilbekin failed to impress 
throughout his team’s lack-
luster win against No. 16 seed 
Albany on Thursday, the se-nior point guard challenged himself to elevate his game 
Saturday.
Did he ever.
During No. 1 seed Florida’s 
61-45 win against No. 9 seed Pittsburgh in the Amway Cen-
ter, Wilbekin scored 21 points 
— two shy of his career high — on 9-of-15 shooting to help his team advance to the Sweet 
16 for the fourth consecutive 
season. UF learned that its op-ponent Thursday in Memphis, Tenn., would be No. 4 seed UCLA, which defeated 12-
seed Stephen F. Austin 77-60 
on Sunday night to reach the South Region semifinals. 
No player was as produc-
tive offensively against Pitts-burgh on Saturday as Wil-
bekin, who also finished with 
three rebounds, two steals and two assists against only one turnover. Throughout the 
contest, the senior point guard 
bailed out the Gators (34-2) when they needed him most.
During the first half, Pitt 
hung close with UF, trailing by 
only two points near the half’s 
end. Then, Wilbekin played the hero.With five seconds left on 
the clock coming out of a time-out, Wilbekin drove down the court, launched off one foot 
from behind the top of the arc 
and released his shot. 
As the halftime buzzer 
sounded, the three-pointer 
found net and Wilbekin jogged 
toward the tunnel with a wide smile plastered on his face as his team entered the break leading by five points.
“That’s the look that I 
hoped for in that situation,” Wilbekin said. “I don’t really shoot too many runner threes, 
but it went in, and I was pretty 
happy about it.”
Senior center Patric Young 
knew Wilbekin was aiming to make the big play.
“I could just see it in his 
eyes when it came down to the last 10 seconds of the shot clock,” Young said. “He was 
like, ‘I’m going to create some-
thing here.’”
The shot provided Wil-
bekin and the Gators plenty of momentum going forward. 
Florida opened the second 
half firing, increasing its lead to 11 points about 10 minutes in. After that, Wilbekin pro-
vided the fuel to help maintain 
Florida’s advantage. 
The point guard caught 
Pittsburgh off guard, driving to the lane on multiple occa-
sions. During a stretch of 4:19, 
Wilbekin scored nine points on three drives to the hoop and a three-pointer.
“I thought as the game 
wore on, we were able to make 
their big guys late to get all the 
way out there like they nor-mally do,” coach Billy Dono-van said. “Scottie was able to 
turn the corner, Kasey Hill was 
able to turn the corner and we were able to get the ball down the lane.”
Added Michael Frazier II: 
“When you have a guy like that, usually you have to give him the ball and move out his way. He was hot and he gave 
us that offensive boost, and we 
needed it.”
Frazier added 10 points on 
2-of-9 three-point shooting, while Young recorded seven 
points and eight boards.
The senior center’s most dy-
namic play of the game came 
in the second half when he 
swatted Pitt guard James Rob-
inson’s layup out of bounds.
“I saw that [Robinson] was 
beat,” Young said. “I hate go-ing for help-side blocks, be-
cause if you’re not going to get 
it and he gets it high enough and if he misses it, then your man is going to get the re-
bound. 
“I saw he was trying to roll 
it up, and I was like, ‘I’m all 
over that one.’”

ORLANDO — In a game where he 
scored just seven points, missed eight 
of his 11 shots and went to the free-
throw line only twice, Patric Young 
still found a way to be a dominant force for the Gators.
Despite the inefficient offensive statline, the senior center had one of his best defensive games of the year, recording a season-high four blocks as well as limiting Pitt to 24 points in Frontcourt propels Gators

A double-digit deficit in the second half 
with the season on the line did not faze the 
Gators on Sunday afternoon. 
Thanks to a furious rally spearheaded 
by senior Jaterra Bonds and redshirt sopho-
more Cassie Peoples late in the second half, 
Florida gets to dance another day after beat-ing Dayton 83-69. 
“It was just a microcosm of the way this 
team’s been all year long,” coach Amanda Butler said. 
“There’s no give up, there’s no quit. All it 
is, is a won’t die, resilient spirit — that we’re just not going to go away no matter what the odds are or what the situa-tion is.”
After a sloppy first half, 
the Gators found the deck stacked against them head-ing into halftime. 
Florida trailed by three 
points and had only five assists against 13 turn-overs.
The start of the second half wasn’t any 
better, as Dayton stormed out of the gates to 
take a 12-point lead with just under 15 min-
utes left in the game. 
Then, the Gators’ offense woke up, and Florida wins tourney opener

Quotable
“Well, he put in the scouting report today.”
Billy Donovan  
UF coach on Patriots coach Bill Belichick attending the UF-Pitt game
the paint compared to Flori-
da’s 36.
On Friday, the Panthers’ 
Talib Zanna said Young plays dirty, which was not intended to be a slight to the Gators’ center but instead a 
compliment.
Either way, Young had 
some fun with the media re-garding the quote following 
Florida’s 61-45 victory over 
Pitt.
“I’m a dirty player,” 
Young said. “I just go out 
there and scrap and fight 
and claw and try to grab re-
bounds as best I can. I know I got more than eight. I want to go back and look at film because I was all over the 
boards today.”
The Southeastern Con-
ference Defensive Player of 
the Year finished the game 
with eight rebounds — six of 
which came on the offensive end to help Florida earn nine second-chance points in the contest.
Fellow senior Will Yeg-
uete also contributed to the Gators’ solid defensive effort Saturday by adding four re-
bounds, a steal and a block.
Yeguete said the key to 
his game was playing with 
more energy than Thurs-day’s matchup with Albany in the Round of 64.
“I was just trying to be ag-
gressive defensively,” Yeg-uete said. 
“We knew going into the 
game it was going to be a 
battle.”
Coach Billy Donovan 
said having the 6-foot-8 for-
ward in the rotation for this year’s postseason has made 
a world of difference, espe-
cially on the defensive end of 
the floor. 
“He’s one of those guys 
that look down at the stat 
sheet and he’s probably go-ing to take anywhere from two to five shots per game, but he just does so many dif-
ferent things in the press,” 
Donovan said of Yeguete. “He’s such a great cover guy with our defense. He’s a 
great help defender.”
The frontcourt play of 
Young and Yeguete helped 
shut down the paint and force Pitt to shoot more around the 
perimeter. 
As a result, the Panthers 
finished the game just 19 of 
51 from the floor and 4 of 17 
from beyond the three-point 
arc. 
In the second half, Florida 
held Pitt to just 23 points on 9-of-26 shooting. The Pan-
thers also visited the free-
throw line only six times.
Donovan said he was 
most impressed with the ad-
justments the defensive crew 
as a whole made during the break.
“I thought our defense in 
particular, both halves it was 
good, but I thought in the 
second half it really, really was good,” Donovan said. 
“And these guys did a re-
ally terrific job from start to finish.”MONDAY, MARCH 24, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 13

Cassie Peoples dribbles down the court during UF’s 81-76 loss to Missouri on Feb. 20 in the O’Connell 
Center. Peoples scored 21 points in Florida’s NCAA Tournament win against Dayton on Sunday.
Peoples scored 21 points against Dayton
their defense locked down. 
“Our defense changed,” assis-
tant coach David Lowery said. 
“Cassie Peoples became a 
poised point guard and was get-
ting in the seams, keeping her 
head up and was just stripping the ball. She got in the zone and really played smart with the ball and made sure we hit the right people.”
After a five-point first half, 
Peoples exploded in the second half for an additional 16 points 
and five assists to lead UF in both 
points and assists for the game with 21 and six, respectively.
“We were talking about our 
turnovers and our decisions and our energy level,” Butler said. “Going into the second half, it was a battle we were fighting. Cassie really woke up and got us going. 
“There was no turning back 
from there.”
Perhaps Peoples’ most impres-
sive stat was her 8-for-8 clip from the charity stripe. 
Six of them occurred within 
the final minute of the game to ce-ment the Gators’ victory over the Flyers. 
Bonds was instrumental in set-
ting her team up for the second-half run, driving to the lane on nearly every possession she had. 
“We made an adjustment,” 
Lowery said. “We put (Bonds) at 
the four a little bit, because we 
thought the high-post area was very open, and we needed to try to expose that.
“Early in the second half I 
thought we were settling — espe-cially with Ronni — for the pull up, what they wanted us to shoot, but we thought we needed to be 
a little bit more aggressive off the 
bounce and just be able to get to the cup when we swung it on the reversal.”
After going scoreless in the 
first half, redshirt sophomore Car-lie Needles emerged as a factor for the Gators, hitting three three-pointers and scoring 11 points in the second half.
“Carlie Needles hit big shots, 
man,” Lowery said. “Enough can’t be said about how well she shot the ball.
“She was confident. She knew 
it was going in anytime it left her hand. I thought her teammates did a great job of finding her.”
Florida closed out Sunday’s 
contest shooting 18 of 23 from the 
free-throw line, a testament to the 
aggressive style of offense they have played this season. 
“When we are aggressive and 
we get to the free-throw line, nine times out of 10, we come out on top,” Lowery said. 
“When you’re getting to the 
free-throw line and you’re shoot-
ing 23 free throws, that’s showing 
that you’re doing things the right way.”
Florida now gets a day to pre-
pare before squaring off against host Penn State on Tuesday in State College, Penn.

UF will play UCLA in Memphis in Sweet 16 on Thursday
methodical, halfcourt team, out of its com-
fort zone for much of the game by speed-ing up the tempo and sending the full-court 
press. The Panthers finished the game with a 
37.3-percent shooting clip and 11 turnovers — 10 thanks to UF steals — to the Gators’ six. 
Florida committed only one turnover 
during the game’s final 22:04. That error came with five seconds left in the contest.
Wilbekin helped shut down Lamar Pat-
terson, Pittsburgh’s leading scorer, by chas-ing him all over the floor Saturday. The senior forward scored only eight points on 
3-of-11 shooting.
In fact, Pitt had only one player, center 
Talib Zanna (10 points), in double-figure 
scoring. 
Now winners of 28 straight, the Gators 
head into a matchup with UCLA in the Fe-dEx Forum in Memphis, Tenn.
After an up-and-down opening weekend 
in the Amway Center, UF is not taking any-thing for granted.
“I enjoy that we’re here, that we have the 
opportunity to continue to play, but I’m not going to be happy or satisfied until we reach our goal,” Young said. 
“I’m not going to say it’s a failure if we 
fall short, but there is just so much potential in this team and greatness within us that if we go out and play like we did against Al-bany and allow a team to just take it from us, 
then we’re cutting ourselves short.”nCAA , from page 12SidE , from page 12Young addresses

ORLANDO — The rims in the Amway 
Center were not Michael Frazier II’s best 
friends last weekend. 
In Florida’s wins against Albany on 
Thursday and Pittsburgh on Saturday, Fra-
zier — Florida’s top three-point shooting 
threat — shot a combined 3 of 13 from be-
yond the arc.
“At this point, I’m happy to get out this gym,” Frazier said after the Pittsburgh 
game.
“But that’s the name in the game. Some 
shots are going to go in, some aren’t.”
Against the Great Danes, Frazier went 
scoreless in the first half and finished with only three points on 1-of-4 three-point shoot-ing. Albany kept a man on the sophomore guard most of the time, even if it meant sacri-ficing points in the paint by not shifting that defender.
Frazier’s struggles continued against the 
Panthers, who did not monitor Frazier as closely. Saturday, the Tampa native record-ed 10 points — second most on UF — but fin-ished with a 2-of-9 clip from downtown.
To regain his touch, Frazier said he plans 
on getting some more shots up this week in practice.
“Nothing that I haven’t done before,” Fra-
zier said. “Keep my same routine. The ball just didn’t go in, so I can’t really dwell on that. It’s in the past.”
Despite his shooting struggles in the sec-
ond and third rounds of the NCAA Tourna-ment, Frazier contributed in other aspects such as defending and rebounding. During the past two games, he has grabbed eight boards and notched a steal. 
“I’ve grown in that area, because last year 
I couldn’t say that if I had a bad shooting night I would continue to play and rebound and play defense, other things that impact the game,” Frazier said. 
“My coaches stay on me about it and tell 
me that I can affect the game in different ways.”
Bruins advance: For the fourth time in his 
career, Florida coach Billy Donovan will face UCLA in the Big Dance.
The No. 4 seed Bruins cruised past 12th-
seeded Stephen F. Austin 77-60 on Sunday night to advance to the Sweet 16 for the first time since 2008. 
UCLA will square off against No. 1 seed 
Florida on Thursday night at 9:45 in Mem-phis in the South Region semifinals for a spot in the Elite Eight. The winner will play either No. 10 seed Stanford or No. 11 seed Dayton — two of the tournament’s Cinderellas.
The Bruins had no trouble against the 
Lumberjacks in San Diego and snapped SFA’s 29-game winning streak, giving Flor-ida the nation’s longest winning streak at 28 contests.
First-year coach Steve Alford’s group 
jumped out to a 42-32 advantage at halftime against SFA and built on it in the second half thanks to stellar play from his backcourt of Jordan Adams, Kyle Anderson and Norman Powell.
The trio combined for 50 points on 19-of-30 shooting, 15 of the Bruins’ 30 rebounds and nine of their 22 assists. The Bruins com-mitted only four turnovers Sunday.
“That’s the way we’ve been all year offen-
sively,” Alford said in a postgame interview on TBS. “We’ve clicked like that all year, and that’s a credit to the guys. Our assist-turn-over ratio has been top five in the country all year, and we needed it [Sunday].”
UCLA shot only 4 of 14 from downtown 
but flourished from mid-range and dominat-ed the paint, going 64.1 percent from inside the arc.
Donovan is 3-0 in the NCAA Tournament 
against UCLA. His first win came in the 2006 national title game, which UF won 73-57. The following year, the Gators held off the Bruins in the Final Four semifinals 76-66 en route to their second consecutive title.
Four years later, UF knocked off UCLA 
73-65 in the Round of 32.
NFL coaches attend Florida-Pitt: When 
CBS showed Bill Belichick attending the Florida-Pittsburgh game and wearing a Gators visor, a screenshot of the New Eng-land Patriots coach and his wife immediately went viral. 
To the surprise of many, the enthusiastic 
Donovan and reserved Belichick have been good friends for years. 
“He was in Gainesville; I guess it may 
have been a Pro Day or watching practice, and he called me and said he wanted to come down for the game,” Donovan said. “I left him a couple tickets.”
Donovan said he talks to Belichick often 
about subjects such as the coaching perspec-tive and motivating people.
“Coach has been great to me,” Donovan 
said. “I don’t know how many years it’s been. I went to Boston and met with him maybe after their third Super Bowl and have developed a very, very good relationship with him and got a great respect for him.”

The Gators and Aggies went to ex-
tra innings for the second time in their 
three-game series Sunday, but unlike 
the first time, Texas A&M came out 
victorious.
TAMU (17-8, 3-3 Southeastern Con-
ference) clinched the series against 
Florida (15-9, 3-3 SEC) in an 11-inning, 
4-3 win at Blue Bell Park in College Station, Texas.
The Aggies jumped out to an early 
lead against Gators left-hander Bobby 
Poyner, who made his first start since 
Feb. 28 against Illinois.
The junior had been successful in 
his seven subsequent relief appear-
ances, giving up no runs in 9.1 innings, 
but Texas A&M tacked on a run in his first inning back in the rotation.
Florida came back to tie the game in 
the third inning on a single by second 
baseman Casey Turgeon, but Poyner 
could not hold TAMU.The Aggies scored another run 
against the junior when he gave up 
a single to third baseman Blake Alle-
mand and a double to shortstop Logan Taylor to start the bottom of the fourth inning. 
Sophomore Aaron Rhodes replaced 
Poyner in the fifth after the left-hander 
surrendered a third run.
Despite the loss, the Gators’ right-
hander may have pitched himself into 
the rotation thanks to his Sunday per-
formance.
Rhodes pitched six innings and 
gave up only one run but got saddled 
with the loss. 
He struck out a career-best six bat-
ters while walking only one.
The Gators trailed by a run going to 
the top of the ninth but forced extras with a small-ball rally.
Catcher Taylor Gushue singled, 
and coach Kevin O’Sullivan replaced him with Ryan Larson to try to get the tying run across.
Zack Powers advanced Larson to second on a sac bunt, and after Braden Mattson moved him to third with a 
single, Justin Shafer scored him with a 
bunt single.
Florida had a chance to score the 
go-ahead run in the ninth, loading the bases with one out, but Buddy Reed struck out and Mattson was picked off 
at third.
Rhodes continued his solid pitch-
ing into extra innings, but the Aggies 
eventually got the best of him.
The sophomore right-hander gave 
up a leadoff single to pinch-hitter Nick Banks, who advanced to second on a sacrifice bunt.
O’Sullivan brought in junior left-
hander Danny Young, who surren-dered the game-winning single to first baseman Cole Lankford to end the game in the 11th.

After a record-breaking regu-
lar season, No. 1 Florida couldn’t 
clinch the 2014 Southeastern Con-
ference Championship title.
The Crimson Tide came be-
tween the Gators and their third 
consecutive SEC title, winning by 
0.175 points. 
Alabama turned in a 197.875, 
and Florida scored 197.70 overall. 
LSU took third (197.325), Georgia came in fourth (197.15). Auburn 
(195.55), Kentucky (195.075), 
Arkansas (194.90) and Missouri (194.65) followed in the fifth through eighth spots of the eight-
team field.
“It was just finishing up; we 
could have been a little bit stron-ger,” coach Rhonda Faehn said in 
a release. 
“But even if we had done our 
absolute best, it would have been a real push.” 
After the first three rotations 
(vault, uneven bars, balance beam) the Gators led all of their competitors. A 10th-of-a-point deduction for an out-of-bounds 
mistake on floor by UF, plus the 
Tide’s meet-high score (49.65) on the uneven bars, won it the lead and the title.
“We know that winning this 
conference is so hard. You cannot afford to count a mistake because that will take you down in the rankings,” Faehn said. 
“This result is just going to 
fuel our athletes to come out 
fighting really hard at regionals 
and nationals.”This wasn’t the first time Ala-
bama defeated Florida in 2014. During the regular season, UF’s only loss was to ‘Bama on Feb. 28 (197.675-197.40).
“We did come in with a target 
on our back,” Bridget Sloan said in a release. “I think it is better to come in with a target on your back and know that teams want 
to beat you.” 
Sloan was one of two Gators 
who captured individual wins. 
The sophomore defended her 
all-around title with a 39.70. Ju-
nior Kytra Hunter won the bal-ance beam (9.925) title and tied 
for a win on floor (9.95) with 
Alabama’s Diandra Milliner and LSU’s Lloimincia Hall. 
Sloan, Hunter and senior 
Alaina Johnson rounded out UF’s tournament lineup as the team’s three all-around competitors. Ju-nior Rachel Spicer set her career best on vault with a 9.90. 
Claire Boyce was the only 
freshman to compete for the Gators. Boyce’s 9.200 on floor was the second to last out of 48 
gymnasts who competed on floor 
and the lowest individual score of any Gator. 
If Florida had taken home the 
SEC title, it would have been the 10th in the program’s history — a fitting way to end a record-break-
ing season in which the Gators 
have scored eight perfect 10s so far. But Faehn maintains this loss is now the motivation her team needs.
“I think it is going to be a great 
fuel,” she said. “It will motivate them to train hard for the next couple of weeks to get ready for 
regionals and come out fighting 
really hard.”Florida’s focused on the final 
two meets of the year. At 3 p.m. today, the NCAA will announce the six sites for the Regional Championships. The top two 
teams from each regional compe-
tition will advance to the NCAA Championship in Birmingham, Ala., on April 18-20. 
“This result definitely fuels 
our motivation,” Hunter said in a release. “We will go home, watch film, critique ourselves and be hard on ourselves. Because that’s 
what needs to happen to win a 
NCAA title.”

No. 1 Florida saw Jaclyn Traina in the 
circle Friday when its three-game series 
against No. 9 Alabama began. She gave up 
only two hits as UF lost 4-2.
When she started again Sunday in the 
deciding game of the series, the Gators 
hoped to adjust and take home the win.
They didn’t.Florida dropped its first Southeastern 
Conference series of the year after falling 7-0 to Alabama at Katie Seashole Pressly Stadium on Sunday. The loss was UF’s 
second shutout of the season and was its 
largest margin of defeat since losing 10-1 against ‘Bama in the SEC Tournament Championship game on May 12, 2012.
In her two starts, Traina limited Florida 
(30-4, 5-4 SEC) to four hits and two runs while striking out 10 batters.
“She’s a good pitcher,” senior Stephanie 
Tofft said. 
“She throws hard for sure. I think we 
just had trouble making adjustments in the box. It just wasn’t a good weekend for us.”
Alabama (27-5, 8-1 SEC) jumped out to 
an early 3-0 lead after sophomore first base-
man Leona Lafaele hit a home run to deep 
center field off of a Hannah Rogers fastball.
“Three to nothing sounds like nothing, 
but in softball that’s a lot of runs,” coach Tim Walton said. “That was probably more 
the difference than anything to me.”Freshman Delanie Gourley came in to re-
lieve Rogers in the third, but the left-hander had mixed results.
Despite keeping the Crimson Tide score-
less through her first two innings, Gour-
ley gave up four runs in the fifth and sixth frames.
With Alabama leading from the start 
and Traina keeping Florida batters at bay, the Gators could not find a spark.
“It’s just tough coming back after getting 
down in the first inning right away,” Tofft said. “We can do it for sure, but it’s defi-nitely tough against a good pitcher.”
Tofft was just one of five Florida batters 
who could not plate a hit against Traina in 
either of UF’s two losses and was one of two 
who didn’t log a hit throughout the series.
She plans to change that as the Gators 
continue on with their SEC schedule.
“After this weekend, I’m not happy with 
my swings, so I will be coming in to do ex-tra work,” Tofft said. “I’m sure everybody on the team will. Our team works, so I’m sure everybody will be doing their own 
work and getting better in the cages.”Crimson Tide hurler blanks Gators in rubber game

2, 7-0 SEC) quickly unraveled as UF squandered two leads — one in singles and another in doubles — to fall 4-3 to the Crimson Tide. 
It was the most tightly contested 
match of the season for Roland Thornqvist’s Gators.
“This was a fantastic college 
tennis match,” Thornqvist said. “Congrats to Alabama, they were outstanding in the clutch.”
Senior Olivia Janowicz 
grabbed a 6-1, 6-3 win for the 
Gators to begin the scoring. Next, 
Belinda Woolcock fell 6-3, 6-2 to even the score at 1. 
Florida answered with two 
consecutive points in straight sets, as Alexandra Cercone pulled out a 6-1, 6-3 victory and Brian-na Morgan defeated Alabama’s Mary Anne Daines 7-5, 6-2.
The Gators led 3-1, but that 
was last time they would score.
The Tide’s Erin Routliffe de-
feated Soﬁ  e Oyen 6-3, 7-6 to bring 
her team within one. 
The pressure fell on fresh-
man Kourtney Keegan, who was 
caught in a tug-of-war third set while her teammates looked on. 
Keegan ﬁ  nally fell 7-6, 5-7, 7-6, 
and ‘Bama forced doubles action.At ﬁ  rst, it didn’t appear as 
though Florida‘s scoring drought would continue into doubles.
Janowicz and Keegan held 
their opponent scoreless in a de-cisive 10-0 win to capture the ﬁ  rst match, but Cercone and Morgan fell 10-5. 
The focus turned to Court 1, 
where Woolcock and Oyen were leading Alabama’s No. 8 doubles duo of Mary Jansen and Routliffe 9-8. 
But the lead was short-lived, 
and Alabama rallied to take the match 12-10 and secure the win.“We are disappointed but 
must continue to work on the little details that can make us bet-ter,” Thornqvist said.
On Friday, Florida cruised to 
a 4-0 win over No. 20 Auburn in which each player won in straight sets in the team’s 11th shutout of 
the season. 
The Gators ended their road 
trip with a 2-2 record, losing to 
two top-15 ranked opponents.
UF will play Arkansas on Fri-
day and LSU on Sunday as part of its two-match home stand be-fore heading back on the road.

Coach Buddy Alexander 
has been displeased with his 
team’s inability to improve in tournament play throughout 
the season. 
The Gators have two tour-
naments left in the regular 
season to impress their coach and save their pride, starting 
with UF’s performance at the 
two-day Valspar Invitational in 
Palm City today. 
“A big-
time tourna-
ment, big-
time course 
and a big-time ﬁ  eld,” Alexander 
said in a re-
lease. “It’s 
another op-
portunity for us to step up and show some improvement.”
The tournament is held 
at the par-72 Floridian Golf Course, which sits near the St. Lucie River. It went through a seven-month renovation in 2011 and has become one of the best and most scenic courses in the United States, featuring the area’s preserves and wetlands.
It will deﬁ  nitely be a change 
of scenery for the Gators, who have not played in Florida since they competed at the USF Invitational in Dade City on March 4.
Florida will also face a chal-
lenge in terms of the ﬁ  eld, which is arguably one of the toughest ones it has competed against. Out of the 15 teams competing, four (No. 3 Okla-homa State, No. 4 Georgia Tech, No. 8 Houston and No. 9 Illinois) are ranked in the top 10 and four more are in the top 25 (No. 12 FSU, No. 16 UCLA, No. 19 Arkansas and No. 21 Texas A&M).
For the ﬁ  ve-man lineup, 
Alexander is sending out Eric Banks, J.D. Tomlinson, Ryan Orr, Richard Donegan and Conor Richardson. The Florida coach will not play an individ-ual in the tournament.
Banks, Tomlinson and Orr, 
who are regulars in the Florida lineup, are coming off career-best performances at the USF Invitational. Tomlinson shot a 64 (-8) at the tournament — the lowest round he’s ever played. His performance there contrib-uted to his team-low stroke av-erage of 72.88.
Banks tied a career-low 
round of 68 (-4) at the USF In-vitational and also ﬁ  nished inside the top 20 at the Chris Schenkel Invitational last week. 
Orr totaled a personal-best 
score of 217 (+1) in Dade City after shooting two rounds un-der par.
This will mark Donegan’s 
ﬁ  fth consecutive tournament appearance and Richardson’s third showing of the season. Donegan’s best performance was at the Sea Best Invitational in February, where he shot 228 and tied for 24th place. Richard-son last played at the SunTrust Gator Invitational in February.
Florida will begin competi-
tion Monday with a 9 a.m. shot-gun start. The ﬁ  eld will play 36 holes Monday and 18 holes on Tuesday.Florida playing at
