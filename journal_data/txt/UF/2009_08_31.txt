NY artist draws
4K to band shell
* THE PERFORMANCE COST
$70,000.
By CAROLYN TILLO
Alligator Writer
The music stopped at 9:45
p.m., only to be replaced by
cheers of "Encore!" and "One
more show!"
Clarence Greenwood, who
goes by Citizen Cope on stage,
returned to the stage and ad-
dressed the crowd of about 4,000
at the Flavet Field band shell Sat-
urday night.
"How 'bout one more song?
How 'bout a couple more songs?"
Cope asked the crowd.
The music started again with
screams of approval, and the free
concert continued.
The concert, put on by Student
Government Productions andthe Interfraternity Council, cost
$70,000 and was the first major
performance at the new Flavet
Field band shell. The band shell
was completed during the sum-
mer.
The Whigs opened for Citizen
Cope at about 7 p.m., and, as the
night wore on, the crowd thick-
ened from about 300 to about
4,000.
Aaron Crespin,
On the chairman for SGCampus Productions Music
and Entertainment,
said he would describe The Whigs
as a garage-style punk rock band
and Citizen Cope as a laid-back,
soft rock band with reggae influ-
ence.
Crespin said the bands were
chosen based on requests from
students and SG members.

Funds up for UF research
By BRIDGET HIGGINBOTHAM
Alligator ContributingWriter
In the face of university-wide budget
cuts, outside funding for UF research has
increased.
Funding for the 2008-2009 fiscal year
increased by 2.2 percent for a total of $574
million, received by about 2,000 faculty
members, according to a university news
release.
Federal funding, which makes up 58
percent of UF's total awards and comes
from institutions such as the U.S. Depart-
ment of Defense, National Science Founda-
tion and National Institutes of Health, rose
by 4.3 percent to $336.5 million.
Funding from state agencies, which
makes up 13 percent, however, decreased
by 8 percent to $75.8 million.

piece of news that is beneficial to every-
body," said Steve Orlando, UF spokesman.
"It's kind of refreshing, actually."
"The good news is that most of
the money comes [from] out of

Win Phillips
UF Vice President of Research
Orlando said medical research from
state universities can provide long-term
economic stability and growth in a state
that relies on unsteady industries like tour-
ism.

Free issues of The New York Times
will be available on campus again start-
ing Tuesday, but the program still faces
the possibility of huge cuts next year.
When delivery resumes Tuesday,
fewer copies of the Times and USA
Today will be available due to rising
subscription rates, according to Student
Body Treasurer Maryam Laguna.
Instead of an average of 386 copies,
there will be closer to 300 copies of each
paper available on campus every day,
she said.
The free papers are part of a $60,000-a-
year program run by Student Govern-
ment, paid for by student fees.
If demand for the papers is high
enough, it's possible to request more
copies later in the semester, Laguna
said.
"Yes, on [Tuesday] there might be
"Copyrighted Material
Syndicated Content
Available from Commercial News Providers"only 300 papers delivered," she said.
"That doesn't mean we can't request 350
papers per day."
The temporary delay in the delivery
of the Times this semester was the result
of negotiations over the terms of the
new agreement that
took into account a
hike in rates.
Next year may
be an entirely differ-
ent story, as the cur-
rent version of the
SG budget would cut
Laguna the amount dedicated
for the program from
$60,000 to about $30,000.
The proposed cut is due to a variety
of factors, Laguna said, one of which is
a major increase in overhead costs, the
result of a recent change in the way UF
bills its units for overhead.
Overhead costs, like the use of UF's
payroll system, would increase from

Women dance on poles for breast cancer research
0 THE EVENT RAISED $500.
By MEG WAGNER
Alligator Contributing Writer
From the outside, the front stu-
dio of the Unified Training Center
looked like just another stop on
Gainesville's monthly Art Walk.
But the art on display at the cen-
ter Friday night was not of prints or
paintings. This art was in motion.
Students and teachers of Studio
Sensuale, a company that gives les-
sons in burlesque and pole danc-
ing, showed off their moves on one
of the polished metal poles affixed
to the room's ceiling and floor.
"[Pole dancing] is about strip-
ping off your layers and drinking
in your sensuality," said Mary Jane
Brunel, owner of French Addiction
lingerie store and Studio Sensuale.
But Friday, the women in pro-
vocative clothing and towering
heels danced for more than per-
sonal satisfaction. The dance show-
case served as a fundraiser. Raffle
tickets for various prizes were sold
and money was collected for breast
cancer patients and research.
Brunel, whose close friend is a
breast cancer survivor, wanted to
donate to the cause.
"It's a very stressful transition
from normal, everyday life to being
a struggle to survive," Brunel said.Studio Sensuale, which calls
itself a "stripper school for begin-
ners," has offered pole dancing
lessons for about a year. The $100
made from the first class was do-
nated to breast cancer research,and Friday's event collected about
$500.
"Pole dancing has all this bag-
gage associated with it -dirty strip
clubs, dirty old men-but that's not
what it's about," instructor RebeccaButler said. "It helps [women] feel
good about themselves."
Pop music set the mood as
Butler took a spin on the pole to
show the crowd what dancing is
all about. In seven-and-a-half-inch

breast cancer at the Unified Training Center. Beyond the table, Rebecca Butler, 22, performs a dance.heels, she climbed up the pole with
little effort, flipped herself and slid
elegantly down. For two minutes,
she spun and shook, a smile never
leaving her face.
There were women and men,
young and old, patrons of Studio
Sensuale and curious locals who
stumbled upon the event as they
walked down West University Av-
enue. Nevertheless, viewers said
they were wowed by Butler's flex-
ibility and grace. They eagerly
applauded her and chanted, "Go
girl!" when she pulled off an espe-
cially gravity-defying twirl.
By the time Butler finished her
demonstration, sweat had gathered
on her forehead, and she sipped ice
water in an attempt to cool off.
"It's not only fun and sexy, but
it's also a good workout," she said.
The fundraiser was also a kick-
off for Studio Sensuale's new home
in the center. Classes were once
taught in French Addiction. With
only one pole in the shop and the
burden of reorganizing racks of
undergarments to make room for
dancing before each class, it was a
crowded location.
The new center lends more poles
and more space to move.
Brunel said she plans to keep
hosting fundraisers while helping
women "into their femininity, their
diva, their goddess side" through
pole dancing.

Bartending
class to start
By KRISTEN BOWE
Alligator Contributing Writer
Hurry up, Gainesville residents who are 21
and older -registration for the home bartend-
ing class begins today at 10 a.m.
Home bartending is the most popular leisure
course and fills up within the first 15 minutes, said
Beth Waltrip, director for campus programs.
The class meets two hours a week for six
weeks on Tuesday or Wednesday from 7 to 9
p.m. in the Reitz Union basement.
Course instructor John "Wonton" Gillooly
said the class gives students the opportunity to
learn the finer ways of drinking and
On the skills for becoming a successfulCampuS bartender. Gillooly has traveled
around Florida as a bartender for 12
years and has worked for various liquor distribu-
tors for more than 10 years.
The first class of each session covers the topic
of alcohol consumption and the effects of alco-
hol on the body. Each succeeding week covers
one specific type of alcohol, the history, how it is
made, specific drink combinations and tasting.
Students will sample wine, beer, dark whis-
key, vodka, gin, rum and tequila.
Gillooly said responsible drinking is his No.
1 priority.
"You don't need 25 drinks to have a good
lime -only one good drink," he said, adding he
will cut students off if they look like they've had
too much to drink.
Although applicants don't have to attend UF,
they must be at least 21 to register for the class.
Students can register online at www.union.

UF shoots down Tebow-themed event
By THOMAS STEWART
Alligator Staff Writer
tstweart@alligator org
"What Would Tim Tebow Do?" night, a minor league
baseball team's promotional gimmick, was shot down by
UF last week because of NCAA rules against the commer-
cial use of student-athletes' names.
The promotion, which was changed to "What Would
T.T. Do?" night, included a man walking on water, prom-
ise rings and a ceremonial jump pass with a football in-
stead of a first pitch.
Initial ideas for the event also included a live circumci-
sion, according to news reports. The idea was reportedly
rejected by management.In an e-mail sent to the team Wednesday, UF stated
Tebow would have been ruled ineligible under NCAA
rules if the promotion had used his name. Stacey Osburn,
a NCAA spokeswoman, however, said
the rule merely states that the student-
athlete or the school must make an at-
tempt to stop the commercial use of the
student's name. UF fulfilled that obliga-
tion when it sent the letter, Osburn said.
Gary Sharp, director of promotions
for the Fort Myers Miracle baseball team,
Tebow said the event was meant to poke fun at
overzealous Tebow fans.
"It was more a night of us mocking how people treat
[Tebow] and put him on a pedestal," Sharp said.
Volunteers renovate center for disabled
* THEY REDESIGNED THE
COURTYARD.
By KATHLEEN BIRKHEIMER
Alligator Contributing Writer
About a dozen volunteers gathered
Saturday afternoon to plaster, paint
and carpet areas of the Arc of Alachua
County, an organization that serves the
developmentally disabled community
of Alachua.
Health Oriented Professional En-
gineering Society, or HOPES, UF's
engineering and health organization,
collaborated with volunteers from
UF's Biomedical Engineering Society
and Home Depot's community service
branch, Team Depot, to renovate the
20-year-old building.
The volunteers carpeted an exerciseroom and redesigned the courtyard, in-
corporating new benches and a garden,
which will attract seasonal populations
of butterflies year-round. The group
worked from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday
and Sunday.
"I know how hard it is for de-
velopmentally disabled people
to get jobs and hold them."
Samantha Smith
HOPES treasurer and fundraising
chairwoman
HOPES will come back Sept. 10 to
teach the regulars of the Arc minimal
methods needed to maintain the court-
yard. Development Director Bonnie
Flynn said the group approached her
last spring with the offer to restore the
facility.Luan Chau, the club's president,
said the project received assistance
from Paul Hirneise, a general contrac-
tor, and plant expert Mary Branden-
burg.
HOPES treasurer and fundraising
chairwoman Samantha Smith has a
developmentally disabled brother who
has had a great impact on her support
of the Arc project.
"I know how hard it is for develop-
mentally disabled people to get jobs
and hold them," Smith said.
The Arc is the only center of its kind
in Alachua, providing entertainment,
education and employment for 200 to
300 developmentally disabled Alachua
County residents.
Flynn is enthusiastic about the
change.
"The exercise room is going to be
beautiful," she said.

The funds will be used for new facilities
The new band shell was
completed over the summer
CONCERT, from page 1
Tim Deaux, The Whigs' bass-
ist, majored in art history at UF
and graduated in 2004. He wore a
blue Gators shirt during the per-
formance.
Deaux's grandmother, Joey
Owen, sat on a folding chair in the
center of the crowd as The Whigs
played.
"It's the most amazing feeling
a grandmother could ever have,"
she said.
After his performance, Julian
Dorio, The Whigs' drummer, said
he noticed a "young energy" in
the college crowd that cannot be
found at other venues.
Dorio said he feels vulnerable
when performing, especially as
an opening act, because there is
a chance the band could sink or
swim.
He said playing on stage was a
feeling unlike any other.
"It is kind of a high that you
can't get anywhere else," he said.The Whigs finished perform-
ing at about 7:50 p.m. As the sun
set, the crowd went from sitting
to standing, and more people
streamed in through the field's
gates. Music played in the back-
ground as the stage was prepared
for Citizen Cope.
"It is kind of a high that you
can't get anywhere else."
Julian Dorio
the Whigs' drummer
Aleks Bacewicz, a Spanish ju-
nior, said she has been listening to
Citizen Cope's alternative, mellow
sound for about a year.
"All their songs get me in a
good mood," she said.
At about 8:30 p.m., Citizen
Cope appeared on the dimly lit
stage and played until about 10:05
p.m.
Cope complimented the new
band shell.
"Y'all have a really good place
to play here," he said.FUNDING, from page 1
Science Center, according to the news release.
Some of the center's studies focus on blindness,
hypertension and smoking cessation.
Fifteen million dollars of the College of En-
gineering's $72.8 million in awards is for de-
veloping alternative energy sources through
the Florida Energy Systems Consortium.
The College of Liberal Arts and Sciences
was awarded $47.9 million. Some of the CLAS
awards went to physics department research
on gravitational waves, funding for which
reached nearly $4 million last year.
The Institute of Food and Agricultural Sci-
ences received $120.1 million, some of which
will be used to study the citrus genome and
improve the flavor of tomatoes.
UF Vice President of Research Win Phillips
said some of the faculty research funded by the
awards can stimulate the economy by creating
products that can be patented and sold, creat-
ing more jobs.
Budget cuts
TIMES, from page 1
$50,000 to more than $400,000
under the proposed SG budget,
which hasn't been passed yet.
Under the current plan, half
of the increase would be taken
from SG reserves for the first
year, Laguna said.
The first vote on the 2010-"The good news is that most of the money
comes [from] out of state," Phillips said.
The university community -everyone
from construction workers to graduate stu-
dents -will benefit from UF's status as a large
research enterprise, Phillips said.
UF's awards fund the
construction of new build-
ings, such as the Pathogen
Research Facility near the
Genetics Cancer ResearchI Center, which will provide
research space. Graduate
students are paid by research
Phillips grants from the award funds
to carry out the research
while undergraduates have access to the tech-
nology.
Phillips believes the faculty's energy and
competitive spirit was a major factor in bring-
ing in more outside funds.
"Our faculty are trying very hard because
we believe in solving problems in our nation
and world," Phillips said.

Beer Fear
Orange and blue cans
will not promote drinking
B ernie Machen can't make up his mind about drink-
Budweiser planned on releasing a number of "Fan
Cans" in university colors for the start of college football
season. One of the cans was set to be in orange and blue
until Machen intervened on the basis that the promotion
associated UF with drinking.
A quick look around the UF Bookstore, though, reveals
a veritable industry revolving around the use of UF's col-
ors and logo to peddle alcohol paraphernalia. Shot glasses,
wine stoppers and Pilsner glasses can be found plastered
with Gators insignia and the colors Machen said he was so
intent on preserving.
Apart from the paraphernalia, UF offers a leisure course
in bartending. Granted, the course has an age requirement,
but the bookstore items can be used by anyone, including
underage drinkers. It seems contradictory to try to disasso-
ciate UF from its party-school reputation and not have any
qualms about teaching UF students how to channel their
inner Tom Cruise in "Cocktail."
If Machen wants to take a hard stance against drinking,
so be it. He should, however, follow through in all situ-
ations, including ones that profit UF. We think Machen's
stance is extreme and unnecessary. Remember the collec-
tive container fiasco from last year? What about the pro-
posed crackdown on drinking at the UF-Georgia game? We
would at least like to see some consistency from him.
Underage students are going to drink on game day
and every other day, too. Machen's theory that Fan Cans
promote underage drinking is analogous to saying that
19- and 20-year-olds are more susceptible to color imagery
than 21-year-olds or that Obama's beer summit will en-
courage drinking among diplomats. The cans might make
Budweiser's sales go up in Gainesville around game day,
but they would have zero effect on the number of underage
drinkers.
Hell, if anything, the can would be more appealing to
the alumni who arrive in Gainesville with 97 different
types of Gators merchandise plastered all over their Subur-
bans than to a kid who wouldn't even question the "drink-
ability" of a partially-fermented Capri Sun.
Besides, Budweiser has already advertised in
Gainesville. A billboard by Original Pizza Palace on 13th
Street displayed an ice-cold Bud with the text "game day
drinkability" in huge, white font all through the last foot-
ball season.
What's the difference between a billboard and a can?
How can the UF Bookstore sell so many products that pro-
mote drinking, while a Budweiser can with orange and
blue colors crosses some sort of nebulously defined line?
How can UF be against drinking culture while they offer a
class that promotes drinking culture?
Apparently Bernie Machen is the only one who can
make these reconcile.
Machen needs to recognize that changing the colors of
a beer can isn't going to transform a Puritan into a binge
drinker, but mostly he needs to either back down from
his attempts to curtail drinking or pursue them enough
that they can actually coalesce into an easily recognizable
stance.

Dems do little to combat craziness
assing health care reform is the Democratic Party'sultimate panacea, but failing to do so, and failing
publicly, would be President Barack Obama's "Wa-
terloo," as Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., opined earlier this
summer.
With the recent departure of Sen. Edward Kennedy,
passing meaningful health care reform is becoming more
and more pressing each day.
Kennedy was revered by his constituents and colleagues
for his ability to reach across the aisle. Yet he wasn't known
as the "lion of the Senate" for always accommodating the
views of his conservative counterparts, but for his ability
to never compromise his liberal ideology.
With public approval of the democrats' signature issue
slowly slipping each day, it appears the democrats are los-
ing the war for the hearts and minds of the nation. They are
not. Instead, democrats are losing a political war against a
republican tag team whose cigar-smoking quarterback is
calling the plays over AM radio waves, and whose cheer-
leader is a Facebook-savvy caribou-on-the-loose in Alaska
with a highly active imagination about death panels.
"Democrats don't win elections. Republicans just lose
elections," Terry McAuliffe, the former campaign manager
for Hillary Clinton's presidential bid, once remarked. The
republicans lost last year both because they were on the
wrong side of the issues and because the majority of the
American public didn't trust Barracuda Palin if Sen. John
McCain pulled a Gerald Ford deplaning Air Force One.
And while the democrats may have gained more congres-
sional seats and sent the first black man to the Oval Office,
they haven't had much luck winning anything since. One
often cited stereotype of democrats is that they're elitist
snobs who've never seen the trenches and can't find the
time to put down their Moscot reading glasses while sip-
ping their fair-trade coffee. It's a false stereotype, sure, but
by refusing to engage and combat the false warnings of"ObamaCare," progressives stand
to lose out on the issue of TeddyEU . Kennedy's professional life to a
group whose leaders mostly egg on
each outrageous claim about Obama
and his democratic colleagues.
Matthew Christ The only elected democrat who's
letters@alligator.org had the balls to stand up to any of
his crazed constituents and explain
that they are, in fact, crazed is Bar-
ney Frank -the openly gay congressman from Massachu-
setts and chairman of the House Financial Services Com-
mittee. When asked why he was supporting Obama's Nazi
policies at a town hall earlier this month, Frank yelled, "On
what planet do you spend most of your time?"
There are more and more people living on that planet,
and democrats are doing little to nothing to bring them
back to planet Earth. A recent Public Policy Polling poll
found that 39 percent of Americans think the government
should stay out of Medicare, which leads me to believe
they don't understand that Medicare is a government-run
single-payer program. Twenty-five percent of Americans
believe Obama wasn't born in the U.S.
Meanwhile, the statistics on health care aren't getting
any better. About 45 million people are uninsured, mil-
lions of whom are children, more than half of all bank-
ruptcies are caused by burdensome medical bills and
thousands die each year from avoidable illnesses because
they couldn't afford regular outpatient medical care. Yet
nothing is being done to lower these numbers because the
insane faction of the Republican Party has been handed a
bullhorn.
Perhaps education reform is needed before health care
reform can ever be tackled.

m ~Letter to the Editor
Religious shirts OK in schools
I'm tired of people being en-
raged at the few Christians who
actually follow what the good book
commands. In the same way evan-
gelicals say, "Don't hate the sinner,
hate the sin," I say, "Don't hate the
Christian, hate the Bible."
John 14:6 reads, "Jesus saith
unto him, I am the way, the truth,
and the life: no man cometh unto
the Father, but by me."
According to the Bible, Gandhi
and all the victims of the Holocaust
are burning in hell because they
did not accept Him as their lord
and savior.
This belief is an integral part ofChristianity. To chastise those who
don't pick and choose from the
Bible, but instead choose to follow
it entirely, shows the hypocrisy of
how we treat religion in America.
As for a student's right to free
speech and a school's demand that
a student change his or her shirt or
be dismissed, I wonder if the Al-
ligator would have defended an
atheist student wearing a shirt that
read, "There is no God."
Being an avid atheist, both the
Bible and Quran say I'll end up in
hell. But until then, I defend the
right of students to express their re-
ligion everywhere, including in our
nation's public schools.

Guest column
Students should rally to permanently reinstate newspaperI n Friday's edition of the Alligator, Student
]Body Treasurer Maryam Laguna wrote that
The New York Times would be restored to
newspaper boxes on campus starting Tues-
day. However, what she didn't mention is that
despite the temporary return of the Times, the
readership program has been cut from Stu-
dent Government's proposed budget.
The Times is a respected newspaper that
many students on campus use to stay in-
formed. Fifteen hundred people have already
joined a Facebook group to save the Times at
UF. One student even said that the Times was
the only thing SG ever directly did for her.
Why then is it the first thing to go? The Times'
presence is part of what makes UF a true uni-versity. Access to information is part of the
academic experience, and students deserve a
reputable national newspaper.
This cut comes from the Student Senate's
budget committee and its chairman, Virlaney
Taboada (Unite Party -District D), the same
group that tried to defund several student or-
ganizations last year. In a $14.4 million bud-
get, why are the services that actually benefit
real, ordinary students the first to go?
The budget committee suggested that the
online version of the Times will suffice, but
having articles online and an actual news-
paper in your hand are two different things.
Even worse than the committee's choice to
cut the Times is that they left huge examples

Formerly known as Do R ReitzJonathan Ossip of wasteful spending
Speaking Out on the books. If cut,
this could easily cover
the cost of the Times
readership program. The so-called "SG Mas-
ter Plan," which according to Laguna will be
used to hire consultants to make an "assess-
ment of Student Government" and "evaluate
how Student Government operates," remains
in the budget for $35,000. And the $50,000 in
the previous year's "Master Plan"? That's be-
ing used to "give us an idea of the services/
space we would need if a new Student Union
was built." Give me a break.
As a student senator, I promise to vote
against any budgets cutting the Times and to

invite any senator, regardless of party, to join
ne in this pledge. However, the few senators
vho support the Times cannot do this alone.
Students need to take a stand and defend
he Times on campus. We need to remind the
enate that it is here to represent you, and that
G should stop putting perks over people.
The budget will be presented at Tuesday's
enate meeting, and the first vote is one week
water. If students voice their opinions and show
G that the Times is here to stay, I know that
ve can get the readership program back.

UF VOLLEYBALL
Gators sweep
opening matches
By ANTHONY CHIANG
Alligator Writer
achi ang@a Iigator org
Florida ended the weekend with the same amount of
downed sets as when they began it -zero.
The No. 8 UF volleyball team (2-0) began the season
on a high note as it swept UNLV 3-0 (25-16, 25-23, 25-19)
on Friday and Colorado 3-0 (25-20, 25-22, 25-15) on Satur-
day in the Campus USA Credit Union Invitational in the
O'Connell Center.
"This was a good opening weekend for us -a good little
practice run," senior libero Elyse Cusack said. "I think now
that we put this under our belt, we feel a little more confi-
dence."
The Gators two-setter offense featuring Brynja Rodgers
and Kelly Murphy was a success, as it led to 74 assists com-
bined between the two players over the weekend. The ver-
satility of Murphy, who can play setter along with the right
hitter position, gives UF the flexibility to play this type of
scheme.
But even coach Mary Wise didn't know whether to ex-
pect this type of success from the offense due to Rodgers'
arrival in Gainesville late this summer after transferring
from New Mexico State.
"The key player has been Rodgers," Wise said. "She's
been here all of three weeks with these players. Imagine
starting a freshman quarterback who didn't enroll early.
That's what it would be like."
On the other hand, Wise expected this from Rodgers'
counterpart. She even admitted to sometimes expecting too
much from Murphy, who won the AVCA National Fresh- Matt Tripp/ Alligator Staff
man of the Year award last season. UF junior Brynja Rodgers sets the ball during the Gators' 3-0 win

Debose's injury could require surgery
0 SENIOR LINEBACKER DUSTIN
DOE RETURNED TO PRACTICE.
By MIKE McCALL
Alligator Staff Writer
mmccall@alligator org
Andre Debose might be following in
Percy Harvin's footsteps after all.
During his time at UF, Harvin dealt
with frequent injuries that seemed to
outlive their original diagnoses, and his
expected replacement is facing the same
thing now.
The talented freshman receiver has
struggled with a hamstring injury this
offseason, and coach Urban Meyer said it
appears to be more serious than he origi-
nally thought."It's a real injury," Meyer said Satur-
day. "We were worried it was just a tight
hamstring, a hamstring pull or a ham-
string strain. It might be something more.
We'll have more details on Monday."
Meyer added that it- could be a torn tendon,
which he believes De-
bose suffered in his high
school state track meet.
DOE RETURNS: Senior
linebacker Dustin Doe
Debose returned to practice Fri-
day, Meyer said.
Doe was suspended in July after an
arrest for repeatedly driving with a sus-
pended license, and after his return, he
worked on conditioning during practice.
On Saturday, Doe practiced with thesecond-team defense, joining fellow line-
backers Lorenzo Edwards and Jon Bostic,
who had the black stripe removed from
his helmet.
Meyer said he'll announce Doe's status
for the upcoming games next week.
MCCRAY IN CAST: Sophomore linebacker
Lerentee McCray broke a bone in his right
hand but practiced with the team on Sat-
urday.
"He has a broken bone with a big club
on it, but he goes as hard as he can," Mey-
er said. "I love Lerentee."
McCray saw action mostly on special
teams during his freshman season, but
the coaching staff has praised his ability
to pass rush off the edge in three-down-
lineman sets and said he could see in-
creased playing time in that role.Hyde lifts
UF to late
win vs. USF
By TYLER JETT
Alligator Writer
tjett@alligator org
A pair of second-half goals from
midfielders Lauren Hyde and Tahnai
Annis helped the No. 7 Florida soccer
team overcome an early deficit, spoil-
ing South Florida's upset bid 2-1.
The Bulls (1-1-0) surprised UF (3-
0-0) at the end of the first half when
Noelle Pineiro snuck into the box and
put the ball past keeper Katie Fraine
with 35 seconds left in the half. Up un-
til that point, the Gators controlled the
tempo of the game.
"In our sport, you can play better
than the other team and end up los-
ing," Fraine said.
Just before the goal, Hyde shifted
from midfield to defense as part of
coach Becky Burleigh's rotation. Hyde
blamed herself and
vowed to make up for
"I told my teammates,Soccer I'm going to score six
goals if I have to. I'm not
losing this game,"' she said.
Considering that would be six more
goals than she had scored in her four-
year career, Hyde's promise was lofty.
But she came through when she bent
a free kick into the upper-right corner
in the 50th minute from 25 yards out,
tying the game. It was the third goal
resulting from Gators free kicks this
weekend, including two Friday night
that lifted UF past Florida Interna-
tional 3-0.
"(Assistant coach) Alan (Kirkup)
yelled at me, 'Kick it hard,' because
that's the main thing we focus on
when we go up there," Hyde said.
"We know how to kick it, but we usu-
ally don't kick it hard enough."
Hyde has received numerous acco-
lades during her four-year career, but
had never scored a goal until Sunday.
She was a prominent defender for UF,

UF will put unblemished set streak on the line tonight against FSU
VOLLEYBALL, from page 14
"I think we are guilty of that with Mur-
phy because of the type of elite plays she
can make," Wise said.
Murphy enjoyed a tremendous start
to her season over the weekend and was
named the MVP of the tournament.
She tallied a total of 27 kills, 34 assists
and eight digs in the two-day event and fellonly three digs short of notching her sev-
enth career triple-double on Saturday.
Benefiting from the assists Murphy
and Rodgers dished out were sophomore
outside hitters Kristy Jaeckel and Colleen
Ward, who combined for 44 kills in the two
matches.
Ward especially came on strong late Sat-
urday, as she recorded eight kills and four
digs in the third set. She finished the match
with 12 kills and 11 digs for her first careerdouble-double.
"If you talk to our strength coach, Matt
DeLancey, he would say
Ward had the most pro-
ductive summer out of all
of them," Wise said. "InVolley ball terms of how much she's
improved and what she
was able to accomplish, she worked really
hard."
Florida will try to extend its 6-0 set streakat 7 p.m. today in the O'Connell Center
against Florida State, a team Wise said has
greatly improved since last season.
"This is one of the best Florida State
teams we've played in years," Wise said.
"FSU has a lot of players returning.
"Four years ago, they had a great recruit-
ing class and those players are now seniors.
This is a team that we could easily see twice
-meaning once this Monday and then later
in the NCAA Tournament."

earning third-team All-America
honors in 2007, but coach Becky
Burleigh moved her to midfield
this season to get her more in-
volved with the offense.
The game remained tied until
the 78th minute, when sophomore
Jazmyne Avant crossed the ball to
Hyde.
Hyde's shot was deflected,
but Annis corralled the ball and
knocked it in from 8 yards out.
Burleigh put an emphasis on
attacking early in the game, and
UF had opportunities from the be-
ginning.
Angela Napolitano was the
most creative player on the field
and set up Ashlee Elliott and Jes-
sica Eicken with good shots in the
first five minutes.
Although the Gators looked
dominant, they struggled to find
the net as USF goalkeeper MalloriLofton-Malachi played well be-
tween the posts.
Lofton-Malachi, who had a 0.88
goals-against average last year,
saved all four UF shots on goal
in the first half and cut off Lind-
say Thompson's angle to the goal
when she got past the defense,
forcing the shot wide.
Fraine said she tried to raise
her own game watching Lofton-
Malachi, whom Fraine shared
playing time with during the sum-
mer for the Tampa Bay Hellenic of
the United Soccer Leagues.
UF lost a valuable offensive
weapon when Elliott, who was
involved in the Gators' first two
scoring opportunities, went down
in the 16th minute after trying to
use her size to power through the
USF defense.
It was determined she had a left
knee sprain, and Burleigh said the
injury's severity would be known
later.Andrew Stanfill / Alligator Staff

JUMPBALL
How much of its arsenal should UF show against Charleston Southern?
F lorida's backups could beat CharlestonSouthern on Saturday.
I don't think anyone would consider
that much of an outlandish statement, but to
drive the point home, here's the score from
the Buccaneers' 2008 season opener:
Miami 52, Charleston Southern 7.
The same Hurricanes team turned around
a week later and lost 26-3 inside The Swamp.
So there will be no Appalachian State-
Michigan repeat here. Not even a hint of it.
Charleston Southern is much worse than
Appalachian State, and the Gators are a lot
better than the Wolverines (Florida isn't a
63-point favorite for nothing).
So Tim Tebow doesn't need to be on Flori-
da Field past the opening 15 minutes. Neither
do Brandon Spikes, the Pounceys or any other
veteran starter. In fact, anyone with a hint of
an injury (the things football players routine-
ly play through) should watch the last three
quarters from the bench.
The reasoning is the same as the Orange
and Blue Debut or a preseason NFL game -
why risk an injury? Why show wrinkles or
tricks up your sleeve?
Obviously Florida-Charleston Southern
will count in the record books, and spring
games and pro preseason games do not, but
the outcome is not in doubt here.
That's why the Gators shouldn't waste
anything special on the Buccaneers. No fake
punts, double reverses or anything of the
sort. These plays depend on the element of
surprise, and that is worth more than the abil-
ity for coaches to see how something would
work. Don't give opponents the film. Save the
tricks for a key moment.
Just let the basic offense and defense do
the work. Run the spread and show off the ri-diculous speed Florida
has. Let the defensive
line rush four guys
and pressure the quar-
terback. Maybe even
sprinkle in a basic blitz
Phil Kegler to give the defense a
Phil on the Hill chance for a big play.
pkegler@aIIigator org But nothing more.
pkeg____r_____g__tr rI'm not calling for
players to play scared,
but smart. Tebow, it really is OK to slide. The
following 13 games are much more worth-
while than running over a Charleston South-
ern linebacker for a few extra yards.
Keep it controlled. The Gators don't need
SportsCenter Top 10 plays after Saturday's
game. They need a team healthy and focused
enough to continue one of the most anticipat-
ed seasons in program history.
A win against Charleston Southern won't
make the team any more focused, but erring
on the safe side can help ease the risk of train-
ers having to tend to an injured Gator.
I realize injuries can happen at any given
moment in a season, but with a veteran team
that's been there before, the Gators don't need
to open themselves to any more liability than
necessary.
Get Tebow and the first-team offense a few
series to sync and see kinks that need to be
worked out in practice.
Let the starting defense show how fero-
cious it is going to be. Then have the very-
capable backups (and third-stringers for that
matter) do the work and see if they can keep
the shutout going.
There will be plenty of plundering against
the Buccaneers on Saturday.
Just let the backups do the heavy lifting.ince moving into my new house thissemester, I've started playing a lot
of ping pong with four of my room-
mates.
The competition has been generally bal-
anced, but there is one roommate who is a
little bit behind the big four -think Man
U, Arsenal, Chelsea and Liverpool.
Every time I play that roommate -Sun-
derland, let's say -I use it as a time to de-
velop my game. There's little to no chance
of me losing to him, so maybe I bust out a
new serve or attempt a slam I wouldn't nor-
mally try. My forehand is a little weak, so
I try to force myself to hit more forehands
against him.
Now, I have developed a stronger serve
and a serviceable forehand for whenever I
play the big boys.
That is exactly how Florida should treat
the upcoming Charleston Southern game.
There's little to no chance of an App
State-level upset happening, but that
doesn't mean there isn't something to gain
from playing a team like the Bucs to open
up the new season's schedule.
Try Joe Haden at quarterback, see how
a three-man defensive line looks or get a
new offensive package some work in a low-
pressure environment.
Urban Meyer and the coaching staff
think that stuff might help them win down
the road, but they can't really be sure.
What could be a better idea than experi-
menting in a game that you will probably
win 999 times out of 1,000?
Sure, Haden could get hurt playingU
Kyle Maistriquarterback, but he
could get hurt play-
ing cornerback, too.
If you think the
benefit you will re-
ceive from having him
play in a real game
Kyle Points situation outweighs
kmaistri@a Iligator org the injury risk, then
it makes sense to use
him.
Charleston Southern is still a better lit-
mus test than practice, if for no other rea-
son than the 90,000 screaming fans causing
an intense, pressure-filled atmosphere.
Another plus to experimenting this
weekend: It gives the coaches one more
chance to throw the new stuff out if it
doesn't work.
If the under-center package looks lim-
iting and unsuccessful against Charleston
Southern, the Gators probably won't want
to use that when they travel to LSU or when
FSU comes to town.
Yes, other teams will have some tape to
watch and help them prepare, but it's not
like Florida would be unveiling something
completely unique.
Tennessee can prepare for the Wildcat
whether or not the Vols have tape of five
to 10 snaps of Haden running through the
Bucs.
Just because my other roommates saw
me use a new serve or forehand against
Sunderland doesn't mean that my game
wasn't better for having developed it
against a lesser foe.
