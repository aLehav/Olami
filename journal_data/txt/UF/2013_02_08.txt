The Students Party has taken an email to UF’s 
administration it believes may have broken Stu-
dent Government codes and possibly state laws.
The email in question was sent by Leah Miller, 
a liaison between the Swamp Party and its frater-nity house representatives for the upcoming SG election. It asks the 25 representatives to collect “I V oted” stickers from everyone in their rosters and supply the party with a $250 check.
But UF’s administration said the email is not 
under its purview. 
Because she didn’t think it violated state laws 
or the Student Code of Conduct, Dean of Students and Associate Vice President of Student Affairs Jen Day Shaw said she referred the Students Party to take the complaint to the Election Commission.
An anonymous Alligator source who received 
the email said it was the ﬁ  rst of its kind. The source said collecting stickers is ineffective — especially because brothers collect more stickers to cover for Swamp email

Gators cornerback Loucheiz Purifoy was 
arrested on a misdemeanor marijuana posses-
sion charge early Sunday morning.
At about midnight Sunday, a Gainesville 
Police ofﬁ  cer pulled over a car for a trafﬁ  c violation in the 2700 block of Southwest 35th Place, according to a GPD incident report.
Purifoy, 20, was sitting in the back seat 
when the ofﬁ  cer approached the car. The ofﬁ  -cer reported that one passenger had marijuana residue on his pants and another threw a mari-juana cigarette out the window.
Police searched the car and found 2.5 grams of marijuana in a plastic bag by the emergency brake, ac-cording to the report. 
Purifoy and the other 
passengers denied the bag was theirs.
Police issued Purifoy 
and three other men notices to appear in court.
Purifoy is the 13th Gator 
arrested since coach Will Muschamp began his tenure at Florida in January 2011. The Pensa-cola native is the seventh UF player arrested for marijuana possession under Muschamp.
Purifoy started every game last season and 
led all returning Gators with 51 tackles, three forced fumbles and two blocked kicks.
Purifoy is scheduled to appear in court for 
his arraignment Feb. 21, according to the Ala-chua County Clerk of Courts’ website.

The U.S. Postal Service an-
nounced plans Wednesday to 
change its delivery system. It will no longer offer ﬁ  rst-class mail de-liveries on Saturdays.
The postal service said the 
new delivery schedule will in-clude package delivery Monday through Saturday and mail deliv-ery from Monday through Friday. The changes are planned to take effect beginning Aug. 5, according to a postal service press release.
Carl Williams, senior postal 
manager of the UF mail distribu-tion center, said the change won’t have an effect on UF campus mail delivery because departments don’t receive mail on Saturday.“We will continue to do the 
dorm delivery on Saturday until we are told differently,” he said, “but at this point, nothing has been written that says it will affect the University of Florida in any way at this time.”
Williams said the center was 
informed of the possibility of switching to a ﬁ  ve-day delivery schedule but won’t be making any changes until it gets further in-structions from the postal service.The decision comes as part of 
a postal service effort to reduce expenses. 
Last year, the postal service 
reported a $15.9 billion loss, ac-cording to the postal service’s in-tegrated ﬁ  nancial plan published in November.
The postal service estimates it 
will save about $2 billion annually

UF researchers participated in a 
six-year national project to create the 
most comprehensive tree of life to date for placental mammals, which are animals that bear live young.
The study, published Thurs-
day in the journal Science, contains data on about 4,500 characteristics of more than 80 species of placental mammals, said co-author Jonathan Bloch, associate curator of vertebrate paleontology at UF’s Florida Mu-seum of Natural History . The large database includes characteristics of animals’ teeth, skull, muscle, nerves, blood and behavior.
“My philosophy has always 
been, ‘More data will always be bet-ter,’” he said.
Bloch led the team responsible 
for coding primates, which includes humans and their fossil relatives. He explained one method of coding, which entails making simple indi-vidual observations about how ani-mals physically look and then relat-ing it to numbers. For example, if an animal has a big head, it’s assigned a zero. Shared characteristics show how various animals are related.
Using living animals and fossils, 
researchers concluded that placen-tal mammals rapidly diversified into modern-looking animals after 
the extinction of dinosaurs 65 mil-
lion years ago, Bloch said. This is contrary to older studies, which ar -
gue this diversifi-cation happened 80 to 90 million years ago and in-
clude only molecular data.
Researchers used the tree of life 
to reconstruct an image of the com-mon ancestor of placental mammals based on inferences, said co-author Mary Silcox, an assistant professor at the University of Toronto Scar -
borough. She said no fossil actually looks like the reconstructed image; it’s a hypothesis backed up by data that an artist turned into a picture.Discovering the tree of life is like 
piecing together a crime scene, said lead author and manager Maureen O’Leary , an associate professor in the School of Medicine at Stony Brook University and research associate at the American Museum of Natural History . She said both processes aim to uncover what happened in the past using more than DNA.
Researchers used an online pro-
gram called MorphoBank that al-lowed them to view archived data from different locations.
MorphoBank documented its 
specific actions thoroughly, a fea-ture Bloch said is crucial in passing the study to future scientists who could eventually incorporate all ani-mals into the tree of life.
Bloch also values the collabora-
tive nature of the project.
“If you really want to approach a 
big question, you need lots of brains that really know what they’re talk-ing about,” he said. “Together we were able to address the question in a bigger way than one person could alone.”

“What your job is, is to collect the ‘I V oted’ 
stickers from everyone in your organization 
until you reach 100% if not more than that,” the email reads.
The source said his fraternity’s house had 
more than 100 percent of the sticker board filled last semester.
“They push you until you get everyone to 
vote,” he said.
The source confirmed every house has to 
give $250. The email said, “It is done every se-mester so this is nothing new, your treasurers should have no problem cutting this.”
The source said there is a silent minority 
in the houses that doesn’t support the Swamp Party.
“I don’t think anyone wants to act against 
it,” he said. “So they just go with the flow.”
Swamp Party spokesman Elliot Grasso ini-
tially said he hadn’t heard about the email and later did not return messages for comment.
As of press time, the Students Party had not 
filed a complaint with the Elections Commis-sion.
Grier Ferguson, a Students Party spokes-
woman, said she wants the administration to further investigate the email and its implica-tions on the election.
“We do have higher authorities who govern 
over us,” she said. “And sometimes they need to step in.”
Since the email was been brought to the at-
tention of the administration, the source said all email and text communication has been stopped.
“They know what they’re doing isn’t right, 
which is why they are trying to cover it up,” the source said.
The email’s final lines read: “DELETE THIS 
AFTER YOU GET THE INFORMATION!! WE CANT HAVE ANYTHING ON RECORD! Sketchy, but do it! Thanks!”

In an effort to cut spending, the U.S. Postal Service will no longer offer deliv -
ery of first-class mail on Saturdays. 
USPS will still offer Saturday package delivery
if it cuts out Saturday delivery, according 
to the release.
North Florida postal service spokes-
man Stephen Seewoester said that most Americans see the switch to five-day delivery as a way for the service to save money and become financially stable.
“We did surveys in advance of this 
and the feedback has been around 70 per -
cent positive,” he said.
Seewoester said he doesn’t think north 
Florida will be affected any differently than anywhere else in the nation.
But the postal service said that its de-
cision to keep package delivery on the six-day system reflects the changing de-mands of their customers and the rise in e-commerce.
Total shipping and package volume 
has seen a 14 percent growth during the past three years while the volume of first-class mail has declined by 20 percent, ac-cording to the release.mAiL , from page 1SG , from page 1Swamp stopped

The deadline to register to vote for 
Gainesville’s March mayoral and city 
commission races is Feb. 19.
Residents can register online at 
VoteAlachua.com, in person at the Alachua County Supervisor of Elections Office, located at 111 SE First Ave., or by mail, according to Supervisor of Elections Office’s press release.
To register, a person must be a U.S. 
citizen, a legal resident of Alachua County and at least 18 years old.
Registrations completed online 
must be printed, signed and returned to the Elections Office, according to the release. 
The office is open 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
Monday through Friday. It also has an after-hours drop box 
located at the main entrance.
Registrations received through the 
drop box will be accepted until midnight Feb. 19.
Mail-in applications must be 
postmarked no later than the registration deadline, according to the release.
The races on this year’s ballot are 
for the mayoral and District 4 City Commission seats. 
All registered Gainesville voters 
can vote in the mayoral race, but only District 4 residents, which consists of most of UF’s campus and areas north of West University Avenue, can vote in the District 4 race.
Amber Benuck, 25, has lived in 
Gainesville for eight years.
She said she plans on voting in the 
March 19 election because city elections directly impact residents’ lives.
“So many people tend to think the 
national election is more important than the city election when it’s the reverse,” she said.
Peter Boemler, a 21-year-old UF 
alumnus, said he plans to vote because he believes the student population can make a difference.
College students tend to be liberal, 
supporting bigger government, he said, and their decisions can weigh down locals.
“A lot of times, students can affect 
the outcome of a city they’re only going to live in for four years max,” he said.Voter registration runs through Feb. 19CAmPUS

When Noelia Trujillo posted 
a picture of herself in a Gators 
hoodie on Instagram, she didn’t know it would find its way onto the @UF_Boobs Twitter account.
The account, @UF_Boobs, 
which aims to show school spirit and a little bit of skin, is encour -
aging women to join the “boob-ment.” However, women’s Face-book pictures are being posted on the account without their knowl-edge.
“If they get from FB, that is 
public,” @UF_Boobs tweeted to an Alligator reporter. “Don’t post to FB what you don’t want seen.”
Trujillo, a 19-year-old journal-
ism sophomore, said she did not voluntarily send the picture, so it should not be labeled as a sub-mission.
Since the last time the Alli-gator wrote about @UF_Boobs, the Twitter has added a Gmail account for anonymous submis-sions.
But for Trujillo, the account 
did not make her identity a secret when they posted her photo.
“In that one tweet, my Ins-
tagram and Twitter handles are shown, so anyone looking at the @UF_Boobs Twitter would see my information,” she said.
Trujillo said when she first saw 
the Twitter account, she thought it was funny , but she now thinks the account’s Facebook lurking is creepy.
She’s not alone.Tia Lenae, a 19-year-old UF 
senior, said her pictures were on the account before she had even heard of @UF_Boobs.
The scariest part, Lenae said, 
is that her profile is private, and she thinks someone she knows could have been the one to take and submit the photos.
“This is putting me out for 
the entire University of Florida to see,” she said. “Not just people who I’m friends with on Face-book.”
Lenae said she was caught off 
guard when she found out she was on the account.
“That can really ruin some-
one’s reputation, especially for professional students who are going to have job interviews,” she said.
Bruce Floyd, UF’s university 
relations social media specialist, said it’s important to be aware of the privacy options that are of-fered on social media sites.
“Take the time to reacquaint 
yourself with any possible chang-es to these settings,” he wrote in an email.

UF’s Counseling and Wellness 
Center has partnered with Kog-
nito, a behavioral health software developer, to implement Kog-nito At-Risk, an interactive online simulator designed for students to identify peers in need of emotional help.
A faculty version of the pro-
gram has been available for almost a year. A student version of the software, which is free at the cen-ter’s website, was just introduced, Meggen Sixbey, associate director of Crisis and Emergency Services at the center, said.
Working with more than 400 schools, Kognito uses “emotionally responsive avatars” to train stu-dents in identifying psychological distress, said Glenn Albright, co-founder of Kognito.
Shari Robinson, an assistant 
director at the Counseling and Wellness Center, said one reason the center liked the approach  was because of increases in the amount and severity of suicide cases at UF.
Ultimately, the software is 
meant to better prepare UF’s fac-ulty and students for situations in which their peers may be at risk, Robinson said.
“We’re hoping to become a 
community of care and concern and impacting individuals,” she said.New software helps 
students help each other

Gainesville Police arrested a 
man Thursday morning in con-
nection with a staged burglary at an Internet cafe last month.
Police charged Xavier An-
towyn Gunn, 39, of 3600 Wind-meadows Blvd., Apt. 120, with armed burglary, grand theft and possession of a concealed weapon by a convicted felon, said Officer Ben Tobias, GPD spokesman.
A surveillance video from 
the Jan. 2 burglary showed Gunn walking into the cafe at 4158 NW 13th Street wearing a gray hooded sweatshirt, pull-ing out a gun and demanding money from cashier Courtney Hamilton.
Hamilton, 21, gave the mon-
ey to Gunn before he walked out of the cafe.
During the investigation, detectives viewed another sur -
veillance video from before the burglary that showed Hamil-ton checking around the store to make sure the security guard and manager were not around and making a phone call before Gunn came in, Tobias said.
On Jan. 6, 
police arrest-
ed Hamilton on armed burglary and conspiracy charges, ac-cording to the Alachua C o u n t y 
Clerk of Court website.  After she admitted to staging the in-cident and was arrested, police couldn’t find Gunn.
At about 8:15 a.m. Thursday, 
a State Attorney’s Office inves-tigator saw Gunn walking into his ex-wife’s house, located on the 2800 block of Northeast 11th Terrace, Tobias said.
Officers from GPD, Alachua 
County Sheriff’s Warrants Di-vision and the U.S. Marshals Florida Regional Fugitive Task Force soon arrived to the scene and surrounded the house, To-bias said.
Officers ordered Gunn to 
get out of the house while a dispatcher spoke to Gunn on the phone. He later walked out of the house and surrendered himself to police.
Tobias said officers believed 
that because Gunn was armed, they brought in the ASO and the Marshals Service to make the arrest.
Police booked Gunn into the 
Alachua County Jail later that afternoon, where he remained Thursday night with a $135,000 bond.

Autism will take place Saturday at 
Ben Hill Griffin Stadium.
Hosted again this year by UF’s 
first lady, Chris Machen, the fitness event raises money for UF’s Center for Autism and Related Disabilities and awareness for autism itself.
Autism affects a person’s behavior 
and his or her ability to communicate and relate socially with others.
This year, in addition to partici-
pants running and walking the sta-dium steps and inner track, there will be a new obstacle race for kids, said Ashley Giddings, president of Impact Autism, a UF student organization and nonprofit under the center. Im-pact Autism has been working with the center to put on the event.
“In the past, kids have been wel-
come to participate ... but this is just our effort to get even more kids, both with and without autism or any type of special needs,” Giddings said.
Participants can pre-register for 
$15 online at card.ufl.edu/sts/ or pay $20 at the event. It starts at 10 a.m.
One out of 88 babies born today 
will have autism, said Gregory Val-cante, director of UF’s Gainesville Center for Autism and Related Dis-abilities.
Valcante said the event brought 
together about 40 people and raised about $2,000 in its first year. Last year, about five times that number of people participated, and about $7,000 was raised.
“I think we are having a positive 
impact,” Valcante said.Gators stomp the Swamp

The Boy Scouts of America decided to postpone its decision 
on changing its harsh policy of excluding gay members. 
“In the past two weeks, Scouting has received an outpour-
ing of feedback from the American public,” said the Boy Scouts’ 
national spokesman Deron Smith, in the Washington Post. “It reinforces how deeply people care about Scouting and how pas-sionate they are about the organization.” 
We give a let-everyone-just-live-their-lives-in-the-woods-

though, that when May rolls around, the organization will make the right choice.
Beyoncé’s publicist emailed BuzzFeed this week to declare 
that too many unﬂ  attering photos of the singer were featured in a post-Super Bowl post.

How often do you listen to what your father tells you to do? 
Because one dad gave his daughter $200 to stop using Facebook. She’s just 14 years old, but she was willing to quit in order to earn a few extra dollars. “I asked her about that.

“Community” returned to NBC this week! It’s like it’s Oct. 
19 all over again. “There is so much anxiety about how people will react to it, because we’re all so invested in getting everyone to embrace the show,” said David Guarascio, one of the execu-tive producers. “On the other hand, we feel like we’re on a night we’d much rather be on … The fact that we’re back on Thurs-day has also helped increase the anticipation a little bit. It’s why dessert comes at the end of the meal, it’s the anticipation that helps make it so satisfying.” We give a this-is-probably-the-last-season-of-’Community’-ever LAUREL to NBC.

I desecrated a national treasure over the weekend, 
and I enjoyed every second of it.
That treasure was “The Star-Spangled Banner.” 
I recorded my attempt at it and failed spectacularly because I can’t sing at all (ask anyone who was at the halftime show for the men’s basketball game against Southeastern Louisiana; they’ll tell you how bad I am.). There was something refreshing about doing something I knew I couldn’t do well and doing it with gusto any-way.
What about those who do have talent? Beyoncé 
Knowles at the inauguration and Alicia Keys at the Su-per Bowl come to mind ﬁ  rst. Tastes in music aside, no one can question that they have legitimate vocal skill when it comes to music. Can they be fairly accused of disrespecting the anthem?
Beyoncé caused a national stir when it was discov-
ered that her singing was lip-synced. I was surprised to ﬁ  nd so many people held the notion that not perform-ing the anthem live was disrespectful. I thought it was the opposite; she didn’t want to do disservice to a song we hold dear and therefore made plans to preserve the best possible performance.
Keys’ version provoked a more common argument 
about the anthem, one that asserts there is a “right” and “wrong” way to sing it.
On a technical argument, based on the actual notes 
of the song, I concede there is a correct way to sing the song. That way is also incredibly hard to sing perfectly, let alone in front of a demanding audience who will harp on a mistake the instant it happens.
To compensate for the difﬁ  culty, we usually see per-
sonal ﬂ  airs attached, whether by holding notes for a dif-ferent amount of time, emphasizing different lines or shifting notes mid-word when traditionally there isn’t one. People view this as an affront to the song’s honor and integrity.So what?Covers of songs are released 
all the time that keep the words but change genres. My favorite example of this is the “Punk Goes” series, in which punk bands perform songs in their own style. The United States is a country that values personal 
freedom, individuality and hard work. The last of those is required to even be considered for the honor and the opportunity to sing such a glorious song, while the ﬁ  rst two are rights of the performer that we also recognize. Because of  their talent, we allow the singers to impart their own style into the song, barring major alterations.
It’s just silly to me. Only one kind of patriotic display 
can be shown, and anything that doesn’t match some-one’s interpretation is offensive?
If you do a quick Google Images search of “the most 
patriotic thing ever,” what comes up ﬁ  rst is a collage featuring the World Trade Center, a bald eagle on a dog wearing a ﬂ  ag, the space shuttle Challenger explosion and a picture of the crew, Captain America, Hulk Hogan and Dale Earnhardt, all set in front of a ﬂ  owing Ameri-can ﬂ  ag. There are things I would both add to and re-move from that collection, but I’m not going to get up in arms about someone’s personal view of this awesome country. We have enough issues in the country to worry about; types of patriotic displays should not be one of them.
If the national anthem sounds amazing even if it isn’t 
what you expected, applaud the work. Those who get riled up over it show they care more about the pronun-ciation of the words over what those very words mean.

When I ﬁ  rst heard the song “Take a Walk” by 
Passion Pit, it was on a Taco Bell commercial. Of course, the makers of the commercial prob-
ably interpreted the lyrics of the song literally, and by that I mean they envisioned people would take a walk — to Taco Bell. I could be wrong, though.
However, I’m here to discuss the song’s more under-
lying meaning. If I’ve interpreted it correctly , it’s about the songwriter’s grandfather, who immigrated to Amer-ica — legally — to give his family a better way of life.
He worked hard. He started by selling ﬂ  owers with 
his wife at a train station. He understood thriving here wouldn’t necessarily be easy , but he knew America was a great country and provided an even greater opportu-nity to achieve success and prosperity.
Ultimately , he did. But with a few bad investments 
and trying to keep up with his family’s materialistic life-style, he went broke. His family went broke.
By the end of the song, he mentions he needs assis-
tance, most likely from the government, but admits he’s too much of a coward to ask for help.
Perhaps we should take a step in the same direction.  Since the president has taken ofﬁ  ce, welfare spend-
ing has risen 32 percent, and, according to the Blaze, that equates to spending on welfare $168 per day (or $30.60 per hour) for every household in poverty, com-pared to the median income of $137 per day (or $25.03 per hour).
Although more citizens are living on the dole, the 
poverty rate in America has gone up from 12 percent in 2002, to more than 15 percent in 2011.
According to analysis by the Senate Budget Commit-
tee, federal welfare spending is projected to skyrocket 80 percent over the next 10 years. Recently, a new congres-sional report showed that total federal and state welfare spending topped $1 trillion.     
Now, I’m not saying  I’m against welfare and entitle-
ment spending (well, from a free market standpoint, I am). Here’s what I’m against: spending billions and trillions of dollars on people who collect welfare for the sake of collecting it and staying on it for the long-run while the government does little to nothing to stop it.
According to a Rasmus-
sen poll, 71 percent of Ameri-cans said too many people get welfare who shouldn’t, and 83 percent are in favor of work requirements for wel-fare recipients. Equality for all Americans has replaced the notion of American excep-tionalism.
No longer is it the government’s responsibility to 
promote the general welfare. Rather, it is the govern-ment’s responsibility to subsidize the general welfare by redistributing the wealth.     
The U.S. has transformed into the United States of 
entitlements. From the welfare mountains to the contra-ception prairies, politicians continue to legislate policies that do little to help the poor.
They’re the do-gooders who, realistically , do more 
harm than good. By trying to help the poor, they actu-ally keep them mired in poverty.
There’s a saying that goes “shirtsleeves to shirtsleeves 
in three generations.” Basically , it’s about the family that starts off with little (hence, a shirtsleeve), but works hard to ensure the child is taken care of.
The child takes over the family business and works 
equally as hard as his parents, watching his fortune peak.
Unfortunately , he and his wife give birth to a child, 
who grows up to be an anti-capitalist pinko. He calls his parents greedy , becomes a vegan, wears shoes made from hemp and takes over the family business. With a double major in political science and women’s studies, he pisses the fortune away and gives birth to a child who wears his shirtsleeve T-shirt made entirely from old picket signs.

Ever wonder if that 
“poke” you got from a friend on Facebook was 
really more of an invitation for sex rather than a friendly “Hello”?
Well, now you can 
get around the awkward wondering with a new application that notiﬁ  es other friends if the two of you want to “bang.”
Here is the breakdown: 
A person installs the “Bang With Friends” app. 
Users click any friends 
they might want to sleep with. 
The friends they might 
want to sleep with will only be notiﬁ  ed of the desire should that same friend also have clicked the desire to sleep with that person.
Long and the short is, 
people don’t have to worry about if the other person is going to feel awkward about their advances.
Now, there are some 
obvious problems with the whole plan, namely the whole friends having sex thing. 
Sex is already an 
awkward situation for some folks, and then, adding that to a friendship can quickly destroy the relationship.
Those worries aside, 
this app appears to be a marvelous  bit of technological advancement for all those out there who are not afraid of “no strings” sex, and see it as healthy.
Obviously, this app 
isn’t for everyone, but for those who enjoy sex as a fun and health activity, it is something to look into.

Gainesville City Commissioners discuss the current neighborhood parking decal system Thursday. They 
unanimously passed a resolution to explore options of raising parking permit prices.

The Gainesville City Commis-
sion voted Thursday afternoon to 
revamp the neighborhood parking decal program in neighborhoods around the UF campus area.
The city unanimously passed 
a resolution to explore raising the price of city parking permits and developing demand management strategies.
Gainesville’s Public Works de-
partment spokesman Jacob Kain said because the city’s current park-ing permit system was established in 1981 to keep commuters from parking in neighborhoods, the pur -
pose of many residential areas such as University Heights and College Park has shifted.
Single-family residences have 
shifted to communal housing for groups of students, which means more cars clogging the area, he said. It’s put a drain on the available park-ing in the neighborhoods and has created frustration for residents.
The current price for yearly neighborhood parking decals is $19.50 per year.
The scarcity of parking has led to 
a “decal black market,” which has led many students to create their own fake passes or find other ways to skirt the system, said Bruce Dela-ney , a rental property manager who addressed the commission during a public comment section.
Teresa Scott, director of Public 
Works, suggested requiring resi-dents to pick up their decals in per -
son instead of completing the trans-action solely online.
“It’s one thing to lie to a comput-
er but another to lie to a staff person in person,” she said.
City staff members recommend-
ed full responsibility for distributing parking permits should fall to the city . Staff also suggested raising the price of permits while starting the parking grace period earlier, on July 15 instead of Aug. 15.
The issue will now go to the 
Community Development Commit-tee for further evaluation.

Facebook users are having an “it’s compli-
cated” relationship with the social networking 
site.
Sixty-seven percent of American adults 
who use the Internet are Facebook users. Of those, 61 percent report they have voluntarily taken a break of several weeks or longer from the website at some time in the past, accord-ing to a study conducted by the Pew Research Center as part of its Internet and American Life Project.
The largest group of study participants said 
they stayed off Facebook as a result of being too busy with other demands or not having enough time to spend on the site. Other rea-sons included a general lack of interest in the site, excessive gossip from others or concerns they were spending too much time logged on.
Bruce Floyd, UF’s social media special-
ist, said he has never taken a conscious break from Facebook since he joined the site on July 13, 2005. Still, he is not fully surprised by the findings of the study.
“I suspect that some people have gotten 
fatigued by the inundation of the content from others,” he said. “Personally , I wouldn’t be surprised if the recent political season has been the cause for a Facebook vacation.”
Steve Johnson, UF’s visual production co-
ordinator with the College of Journalism and Communications and co-instructor of a so-cial media journalism class, attributes the Fa-cebook breaks to the ongoing surge of social media.
“We’re being flooded with social media 
options,” he said. “It can be so demanding that it has a backlash effect.”
Johnson also suggested users may be get-
ting bored with the site over time.
Christine Flammia, a 19-year-old UF jour -
nalism sophomore and five-year Facebook user, is among the majority of people who have put the site on hold at one point or an-other.
“When I go on vacation, I like to shut off 
electronics,” she said. “It can get very over -whelming.”
Flammia said she is not surprised by the 
results because she knows a lot of people who have done the same thing.
However, 19-year-old UF finance sopho-
more Sean Wilson, who has been on Facebook for six years, said he doesn’t see a need to log off for an extended period of time.
“I have enough self-control to not be on 
Facebook when I’m trying to do homework,” he said.
He said he was shocked when he heard 
how many people have intentionally taken a break from the site.
Although Facebook can be a positive way 
to interact with a variety of people, the results of the study suggest people are realizing they can live without it — even if only temporar -
ily.
“There’s still value in human connection,” 
Johnson said.

� THIRTY FILMS WILL BE SHOWN.

Saturday kicks off the fourth annual 
Cinema Verde Environmental Film & 
Arts Festival.
The festival will be at Jolie located at 6 
W. University Ave., and will feature en-vironmentally themed films and art, said Trish Riley, director of the festival.
Riley said she received more than 100 
submissions from 17 countries, and about 30 films were selected to be screened dur -
ing the six-day festival.
Admission to a film block costs be-
tween $5 and $10. Day passes, which give attendees a chance to view all the films shown on a given day, will cost between $15 and $25, Riley said.The festival will also include an Eco-
Fair, a night honoring local farmers in-cluding a fashion show and awards cer -
emony.
Margeling Santiago, a 20-year-old UF 
business junior, said it’s difficult to gather funds to support the festival.
She said the festival was taking a dif-
ferent approach for raising money.
“We were pushing toward bigger 
amounts,” she said. “But as it got closer, we’ve been asking for smaller donations, which has been more successful.”
Although the festival spreads aware-
ness about vital environmental issues, Ri-ley said the focus is solution-oriented for fixing the environment.
“We have a great, strong support-
ive community of people who really do understand environmental issues,” she said.Environmental film, art

What if you could sit on an airplane 
without children kicking your seat or babies 
wailing in the background?
An Asian airline is making that possible.AirAsia X, the long-haul arm of AirAsia, 
launched its Quiet Zone this week, banning passengers under 12 from the first seven rows of economy class on flights to China, Taiwan, Japan, Korea, Australia and Nepal.
Although there is no additional charge 
for the Quiet Zone, passengers traveling with children under 12 are also not allowed to sit in the area, according to the airline.
AirAsia X joined Malaysia Airlines, which 
already offers child-free first class seating and a child-free upper deck economy sec-tion.
With the idea picking up in Asia, child-
free sections on an airplane doesn’t look like it will be making an appearance in North America anytime soon.
American Airlines spokesman Matt Miller 
wrote in an email that the company “doesn’t have plans to do something similar.”Kate Fogarty, UF associate professor of 
youth development, said business traveling is the only way airlines in the U.S. could jus-tify child-free seating.
Fogarty said work culture in the U.S. is 
not always family-friend-ly, adding that grocery stores and restaurants give subtle hints.
“Taking your kids to 
Walmart — even though it seems like a family-friend-ly place — there still are expectations,” she said.
For some flyers, a child-
less flight is worth putting out extra cash.
About one-third of the respondents to a 
2012 ABCNews.com poll said they would pay more for a kid-free flight.
Margaret Yan, a 19-year-old UF business 
administration sophomore, said she travels often to Taiwan and would be willing to pay for a flight that offers an escape from restless children.
“It’s sort of like roller coasters,” she said. 
“You have a limit.”Airlines not on board with babies“We’re being flooded with social

Upchuck is never pleasant. 
Neither is diarrhea. Throw in some stomach pains and a 
fever, and it sounds like a textbook case of food poisoning.
These symptoms, outlined by Mayo 
Clinic, are all too familiar for the estimated 48 million Americans who get sick, 128,000 who are hospitalized and 3,000 who die from foodborne diseases every year. 
The Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention released information late last month about its 11-year study to determine what foods make people sick. 
For the first time, the CDC compiled a 
list of the sources of foodborne illnesses acquired in the United States.
The study, which was conducted from 
1998 to 2008, showed illness was attributed to 17 different food categories. 
The CDC estimated produce accounted 
for 46 percent of illnesses, and meat and poultry accounted for 29 percent of deaths. 
Of the meat, poultry accounted for the 
most deaths at 19 percent.
Leafy vegetables accounted for the most 
illnesses.
Many of those illnesses were caused by norovirus.
“We’ve known for a long time that 
norovirus and possibly other viruses that we don’t know as much about are the leading cause of foodborne illness,” said Douglas Archer, associate director of Florida Agricultural Experiment Station. “They cause very fleeting, but usually very explosive, illness in adults or in people.”
Archer said the odds that someone 
will get sick from foodborne disease are incredibly low, which can be further prevented by washing produce.
Keith Schneider, associate professor for 
UF Food Science and Human Nutrition, agreed.  
“As far as risk to the consumer on an 
everyday basis, you are more likely to get into a car accident than you are in getting a foodborne illness,” he said.
According to the CDC, sick food 
handlers specifically caused 53 percent of the norovirus outbreaks, which involve two or more people affected by contaminated food, Schneider said.
“If a worker’s ill and they’re not 
washing their hands, the chances of them cross contaminating or making people sick is very high,” he said.
Food safety and sanitation is taught at 
UF, and proper hand washing is always one of the key topics, he said.
Overall, Schneider said the 
announcements made by the CDC seem “fairly dramatic” because “food today is cleaner than it ever has been.”
Archer agreed.“We eat millions of tons of fresh 
produce daily in this country, and we eat safely,” he said.FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 8, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 9

Still, UF doesn’t have to 
worry about Yeguete sitting out the rest of the regular season.
Yes, the Gators will lose 
more games now. Hell, they lost four of the next five after Yeguete suffered the fracture in his foot last year. They had Cody Larson and a healthy Casey Prather then, too. 
But, that doesn’t matter. Teams don’t get remem-
bered for how many wins they have in the regular season. They get remembered for post-season runs and winning na-tional titles.
Nobody remembers that the 
Gators finished 35-5 in 2006-07 or that they were 33-6 in 2005-06. The only thing people re-member is if they won it all. Yeguete’s knee will be re-
evaluated before the Southeast-ern Conference Tournament be-gins on March 13. Barring any setbacks, he should be good to go for the postseason. 
If Yeguete can’t return for 
the SEC Tournament, Florida will still be fine. 
With a weak conference, 
the Gators should take the title without Yeguete. Even if they don’t win the SEC, all is not lost.
Kentucky did just fine de-
spite losing the SEC tourney final to Vanderbilt last year.
In 2012, a worse Florida 
team made it to the Elite Eight without Yeguete.
As long as Yeguete returns 
to the court in time for the NCAA Tournament, the No. 2 Gators still have a shot at their third national title.
UF needs Yeguete, just not 
right now.

Lewis is averaging 8.3 points and 6.4 rebounds 
per game this season. She logs 21.8 minutes per 
contest. Yet in her first full season — Lewis missed the final 14 games of her freshman campaign and received a medical redshirt last year — she must be-come more reliable with a lower degree of variance, 
something Lewis has started to understand. 
“I definitely expect more of myself, and I think 
my teammates and coaches do as well,” Lewis said. 
“Not just trying to be a part of this team but be 
an impact player and do whatever that means — 
if that means to rebound, if that means to score, if that means to be a stopper on defense or make good passes on the inside. I’m just trying to do whatever it takes to win.”  
The Gators need to string together wins to bol-
ster their odds of making the NCAA Tournament. Florida plays at Auburn on Sunday at 3 p.m. and has six other remaining games prior to the SEC Tourna-ment. 
Improved production from Lewis will be critical 
during that stretch. 
Recruit earns honor: The Women’s Basketball 
Coaches Association selected Class of 2013 prospect Ronni Williams as one of 20 high school players to participate in the 2013 WBCA High School All-America Game. 
Williams, a 6-foot-2 forward, is the first Gators 
signee ever selected to the annual game, which be-gan in 1992. The Daytona Beach native is the na-tion’s No. 13 overall prospect and is also a nominee for the McDonald’s All-American Game, which will announce its participants on Feb. 14.

  For the second straight year, 
Will Yeguete will miss a sig-
niﬁ  cant amount of time due to injury . 
  Yeguete will undergo ar-
throscopic surgery today to remove bone chips in his right knee. He will be out 4-6 six weeks, coach Billy Donovan said Thursday . 
  Yeguete will miss at least the 
remainder of the regular season, but Donovan is hopeful that the junior forward will return to the lineup for postseason play.
  During No. 2 Florida’s 80-69 
loss to Arkansas on Tuesday night, Yeguete tweaked his knee and exited the game with 15:52 in the ﬁ  rst half after play-ing less than a minute. Right knee tendinitis began bothering the 6-foot-7, 240-pound Yeguete in January.
  “We just don’t want to get 
into a situation where, once a week, we’re just draining his knee and draining his knee and doing those kinds of things,” Donovan said. “I don’t think that’s healthy for him. Right now for him, the best thing to do is to get it resolved, get it taken care of it, and hopefully get him back.”
  Last season, Yeguete frac-
tured his left foot against Au-burn on Feb. 21 and missed UF’s ﬁ  nal nine games. Florida lost four of ﬁ  ve contests to South-eastern Conference opponents following Yeguete’s injury . 
  On Wednesday at 9:47 p.m., 
Yeguete posted on his Twitter account (@Will15Yeguete): “I can’t believe this is happening, this must be a nightmare....”
  Yeguete has been a key re-
bounder and versatile defender for the Gators (18-3, 8-1 SEC) this year. He also plays an in-tegral role in UF’s full-court press.  
  In 21.9 minutes per game 
off the bench, Yeguete aver-ages 6.3 rebounds and 1.1 steals per game — both second-best on the team. He leads Florida in rebounds per minute and is 78th in the nation in defensive rebounding rate, according to KenPom.com. 
  “He’s very important,” red-
shirt senior guard Mike Rosario said. “Obviously , he’s one of our, like, dirty guys. That’s what we call it. (He’s) a Dennis Rod-man type — grab a rebound, es-pecially our hustle guy.”
  Florida’s frontcourt is thin-
ner than it was last year without Yeguete. In 2011-12, the Gators relied on 6-foot-9 forward Cody Larson for extra depth. 
  No. 2 Florida will replace 
Yeguete with junior Casey Prather, and freshmen Michael Frazier II and DeV on Walker when it hosts Mississippi State (7-14, 2-7 SEC) on Saturday at 5 p.m. in the O’Connell Center. 
  Prather is averaging career-
best numbers in scoring (5.4 points) and rebounds (2.8) this year, but the 6-foot-6 forward is still recovering from a high left ankle sprain suffered against LSU on Jan. 12.
  “We’re not really getting 
anything out of Casey right now,” Donovan said. “He has

 Forward to undergo surgery on knee
AGOSTIN RATIONAL
    When February rolls around, Will 
Yeguete isn’t feeling the love.
  Last year on Feb. 21, Yeguete 
limped off the court with 11:11 left against 
Auburn. The Gators went on to beat the Ti-gers 63-47, but the good news ended there. 
  Yeguete missed the ﬁ  nal nine games of 
the 2011-12 season due to a broken left foot.
  The junior forward’s luck hasn’t im-
proved much this year.
Yeguete has been battling tendinitis 
in his right knee since Florida’s 77-44 win against Georgia on Jan. 9.  
  He spent the next seven games playing 
through the injury , but during Tuesday’s 80-69 loss against Arkansas, the pain be-came too much. Yeguete came off the bench with 16:44 left in the ﬁ  rst half and exited the game for good 52 seconds later.
  On Thursday , 
coach Billy Dono-van announced that Yeguete will undergo ar-throscopic surgery today to clean out bone chips in his 
right knee. The surgery will sideline Yeg-uete for 4-6 weeks. 
  “He’s had some signiﬁ  cant swelling over 
the last couple of weeks,” Donovan said.
“He’s got some ﬂ  oating chips and carti-
lage in there which we knew beforehand. … But I think because those chips are ﬂ  oat-ing around, they probably got into different parts of his knee.”
  Losing Yeguete hurts. No doubt.   Yeguete is second on the team behind 
center Patric Young in rebounding with 6.3 per game despite averaging 5 fewer min-utes per contest. 
  Yeguete is also constantly receiving 
praise from Donovan as Florida’s ﬁ  rst play-er off the bench.
  “It’s so hard to ﬁ  nd players that are re-
ally interested in doing all the dirty work, things that don’t necessarily show up in a stat sheet, and you don’t get a lot of atten-tion for them,” Donovan said on Jan. 14. 
“He’s a great defender. He’s a really good 
pick-and-roll defender. He’s really, really good at rebounding the basketball. He’s a

  Kayla Lewis has been an enigma for 
Florida this season. 
  On some nights, the sophomore uses 
a blend of quickness and athleticism to 
make her presence felt, such as her per-formance against Ole Miss on Jan. 24. 
  Lewis scored a career-high 23 points 
on 9-of-13 shooting in the Gators’ 88-81 loss to the Rebels. She also pulled down seven rebounds and notched a block, put-ting together the type of all-around effort coach Amanda Butler envisioned when she recruited Lewis out of Decatur, Ga.
  “Mississippi was deﬁ  nitely my best of-
fensive game that I’ve played since I’ve been in college,” Lewis said. “My coaches were very pleased with it.”
  However, on other nights, Butler and 
her coaching staff are left wondering if Lewis even traveled with the team. 
  A week after 
her dominant ef-fort against Ole Miss, Lewis and Florida played at Missouri on Jan. 
31. UF was in the midst of a four-game losing streak. 
  Against the Tigers, Lewis exempliﬁ  ed 
what makes her play so confounding. She scored just two points on 1-of-5 shooting and grabbed only two rebounds. 
  Following the Gators’ 69-64 loss, But-
ler lashed out at her team. She made no effort to mask her frustration with the inconsistencies that have plagued Florida throughout the season and especially during Southeastern Conference play. 
  “We have a consistency and reliability 
problem, and it’s a bad time of year to be experiencing that because you’re going to play great teams every night,” Butler said following the loss to Missouri. “Every game, someone doesn’t show up. Some-body on our team doesn’t show up and doesn’t give us what we need from her.”
  Though Butler’s criticism was not spe-
ciﬁ  cally directed at Lewis, the sophomore was certainly not the exception. Lewis was hardly a factor in the game and her performance epitomized the efforts that  Inconsistency

Taylore Fuller always wanted to be a 
Gator.
Growing up in Trenton, about 45 min-
utes from Katie Seashole Pressly Softball 
Stadium, Fuller dreamed of one day don-ning the orange and blue.
“From eight or nine years old, every girl 
within probably a three-hour radius wants to play softball for UF,” Ginger Fuller, Taylore’s mother, said.
“As she got older, UF was always 
picked No. 1.”
But Taylore never knew if she would 
get to follow her dreams and play softball for the Gators. NCAA rules state that col-lege coaches cannot contact high school players until their junior season.
Despite putting up prolific numbers in 
high school, including a .778 batting av-erage with 14 home runs her senior year, Taylore thought any mistakes she made would cost her the opportunity to play in Gainesville.
“Taylore felt like every scholarship lasts 
every at-bat,” Ginger said. “If she did well, she was fine. If she didn’t, she wouldn’t get recruited.”
But once the recruiting period opened 
up, faxes poured into the Chiefland High office, and envelopes filled the Fullers’ mailbox. 
“She was getting a couple letters a day,” 
Ginger said. “‘Did you know you got the same birthday as our coach? That’s a sign you’re supposed to go here.’ It was very flattering.”
But Florida was always at the top of the 
list, and coach Tim Walton sold her on the program.
“He wasn’t trying to bad mouth any 
other schools or anything, so that was nice,” Taylore said.
“He just did the best that he could, and 
he saw what I had.”
   Ginger coached Taylore at Chiefland. 
But Taylore didn’t receive any preferential treatment from her mother.
“She was always harder on me than ev-
eryone else,” Taylore said. “That’s how it’s always been with my parents.”
But Ginger had her reasons for being so 
hard on Taylore.
“Our kids ... had to be so much better 
than everybody else,” Ginger said.
“They had to work harder. They had to 
run more. They had to hit more. They had to steal more, because we never wanted anybody to say that the only reason she was there was because she was the coach’s kid.”
The constant pushing from her parents 
kept Taylore, one of the best high school players in the country, grounded.
After her senior year, she was ranked 
the No. 6 catcher in the nation and No. 38 overall recruit by ESPN.
“She never really had a clue how many 
home runs she had,” Ginger said. “She was always leading the area by quite a bit.”
Though Taylore was a team leader, she 
was never the most vocal player. 
“She’s not a real talker,” Ginger said. 
“Even when she was little, she wouldn’t do the cheers and chants that they do in the dugout. She just wanted to be there and play, and that was it.”
But Taylore needs to work on improv-
ing her communication. She has competi-tion for the starting catcher role.
Florida signed three catchers in 2012. 
Along with Taylore, the Gators have fresh-men backstops Cari Broderick and Aubree Munro. Munro came to Florida as the No. 7 catching recruit and No. 42 overall pros-pect in the country, according to ESPN.
Both Taylore and Munro have earned rave reviews from teammates, Walton and each other. 
“She’s the most amazing catcher I’ve 
ever seen,” Taylore said of Munro.
“She’s so good. She’s naturally gifted, 
obviously, but she also has the technicals about catching down, too.”
Said Munro: “Taylore Fuller’s a great 
stick, and she’s going to contribute a lot in the batting lineup, for sure.”
Taylore is listed on the official roster as 
a utility player. She expressed her willing-ness to play anywhere on the field if Wal-ton asked. Walton decided to try her at catcher, third base and in the outfield.
“She’s never played outfield before, but 
that’s something her athleticism’s allowed her to do,” Walton said.
“She has a really strong throwing arm, 
good foot speed, can dive and do some things.”
Walton plans to bat Taylore in the mid-
dle of Florida’s lineup.
Ginger believes Taylore will not have 
much trouble adjusting to all the facets of college softball.
“She’s got the skill set to do whatever 
she wants,” Ginger said of her daughter.
“I think she’ll give them 110 percent, 
and all they have to do is ask.”
   
Taylore will make her college debut 
this weekend at the Kajikawa Classic in Tempe, Ariz. Whether those innings will be at catcher or in the field have yet to be decided.
Despite waiting years to take the field 
for the Gators, Taylore isn’t worried about the competition. She is just happy to be at Florida. Happy to have a chance to prove her worth — one at-bat at a time.
“I’ve been facing the best pitchers, so 
that part I’m not nervous about,” Taylore said.
“To finally be here is pretty awesome. I 
grew up watching them play, and I’m ex-cited to put on the jersey for the first time. It’s everything I thought it was going to be and more.”16, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 8, 2013
