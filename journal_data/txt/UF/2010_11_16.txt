SANFORD — A central Florida dealer -
ship trying to drum up business is offering 
an unusual perk for potential used-truck buyers: A free AK-47 assault rifle.
General sales manager Nick Ginetta says 
that since the promotion was announced on Veterans Day, business has more than doubled at Nations Trucks in Sanford.
Customers would have to pass a back-
ground check before using the $400 gun shop voucher. They also have the option of using the money toward other firearms, or they can request a check in that amount instead.
The dealership has fielded some com-
plaints about the deal, which Ginetta ac-knowledges is controversial. But, he adds: “My buyer is absolutely a gun owner, no question.”
The promotion runs through the end of 
November.

When Gainesville’s Becky Rountree received an iPad 
for her birthday, she didn’t think it would lead to saving 
the city thousands of dollars. She just thought it was a great present from her husband. 
But since Rountree, the city administrative services 
director, got her gift, the iPads are multiplying in city hall. Last month, Mayor Craig Lowe was the first of the city commission to use an iPad as an initiative to go pa-perless. 
“I’m getting used to looking at the agenda in a differ -
ent way,” he said.
The mayor said he was eager to give it 
a try and described the transition from pa-
per agendas to digital as smooth.
“I don’t think that it will replace paper,” he said. “But 
it will reduce it.”
It’s almost been a month since he started using the 
iPad, and today, all seven members of the commission 
will have their own, saving the city an estimated $1,715 this year and more than $5,000 each year after.
“I’ve never seen anything happen so fast,”    Rountree 
said. Commision

UF is the biggest recipient of a $10 
million joint award to the state univer -
sity system. 
The $2.45 million share of the 
award, announced Monday, is part of 
the 2010 New Florida Initiative. 
The initiative is a collaborative ef-
fort — along with business and gov-ernment — to aid Florida’s economy and create high-technology and high-
wage jobs.
All 11 state universities pitched 
more than 93 proposals for the initia-tive’s awards, and 31 were selected by 
the Board of Governors of the State University System. 
UF President Bernie Machen said 
the program is an example of what 
can happen when you pool the best 
research skills and 
focus them on a challenge. 
“The people of 
Florida will ben-efit greatly from this partnership with FSU through 
improved health 
care and a stronger 
economy,” Machen said.
UF is also involved with programs 
involving climate change, expansion of Internet infrastructure and biomedi-cal engineering.
The money was given to the Board 
of Governors by the state legislature, and the funds will produce a series 
of demonstration projects that show a 
high return on investment, so the proj-ects can continue into next year.
Board Chairwoman Ava Parker 
said this is the best way to leverage not just the best current and future academic scholars, but nationally re-nowned facilities and university re-sources, as well.
As part of its standard overall year -
ly budget request, the board has asked the Legislature for $150 million for next year, which would be the second 
year of the New Florida Initiative.UF gets biggest cut of grant

The plan to build a 100-mega-
watt biomass power plant in 
Gainesville has been recom-
mended for approval to Gov . Charlie Crist and his Cabinet by a state administrative law judge. 
After a four-day hearing in 
August concerning the plant’s approval, Judge Robert E. Meale issued a 72-page recommended order earlier this month.
The plant, officially titled the 
Gainesville Renewable Energy Center, will be 8 miles northwest of downtown Gainesville and will use clean wood waste, such as forest residue, to produce elec-tricity . 
“The City of Gainesville has 
identified numerous benefits from the GREC project,” Meale wrote.
Among the benefits are en-
hancing the integrity and reli-
ability of the generating system, Judge urges Crist 
to approve plantSEE IPAD, PA gE 5

As Cougar rolled to the finish, 
its creators held their breath.
The car, fueled entirely by 
chemical reactions, had passed 
the rigorous safety test. 
It was consistent in practice. 
All it had to do now was stop 
near a line.
It stopped 29 inches from the 
line, which was good enough to 
propel the team from UF’s chap-
ter of the American Institute of 
Chemical En-
gineers tempo-rarily into first place. 
Team members jumped and 
chanted, “It’s great to be a Flori-da Gator!” with the University of South Florida team.
The UF team took second 
place in the national Chemical Engineering Car competition, nicknamed the Chem-E-Car and hosted by the AIChE, and earned 
the title of Most Consistent Per -
formance on Nov. 7 in Salt Lake 
City. 
Cornell University competed after the UF team and ended up winning first place. 
The car runs only off of hydro-
gen, which powers a fuel cell to run the motor. 
The competition required a 
car to stop at a line 95 feet away while carrying 250 grams of wa-ter.
Cary Warsetsky, president of 
the UF chapter of AIChE, said the club has progressed immensely in the four years he’s been in-volved. He said his team barely had a moving car his freshman year and that to place second in 
nationals is an amazing improve-
ment.
Next year, they plan to build 
two cars: a reliable car like Cou-gar and an innovative car that no 
one’s ever seen before. 
They want to win the creativ-
ity contest, too.
In order to prepare for the com-
petition, club members started 
planning last September and met twice a day for the two months leading up to the competition.
“It’s a year-round project,” 
said Louis Vazquez, chairman of the Chem-E-Car project.
As far as hands-on learning 
goes, he said this project is king. 
Older members teach new stu-
dents how to build the car and how to avoid the problems they had in other competitions. 
“You pick up things that you 
didn’t learn from a textbook,” he said.
Warsetsky said the win was a 
boost for UF’s image, but it was 
also a personal victory for him 
and his team.
“It was definitely a good mo-
ment for us,” he said.TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 16, 2010 � ALLIGATOR, 3

The cries for help from a kitten stuck in 
a storm drain 20 feet below ground came 
to an end on Sunday when a Gainesville firefighter saved the forsaken feline.
The animal was trapped at Walmart, 
2649 NW 13th St., where the employees told Mary Marion,  of Lake City, nothing could be done to help the kitten. 
“I just had to do something,” she said. She called 911, and Gainesville Fire Res-
cue  arrived at the scene at 3:25 p.m. 
“I thought this situation would be 
easy,” said Jeff Lane, Fire Department district chief. “But the situation was more 
complex because of possible hazardous 
materials in the drainage pipe, such as hy-drogen sulfide.” 
Firefighters first removed the large 
grates covering the drainage vault and tried unsuccessfully to coax the kitten with cat food.
When that didn’t work, firefighter Da-
vid Sutton crawled in the dangerous, vile 
air pipe to grab the kitten. 
“At first the kitten did not want to be rescued. She clawed and bit at my glove,” he said.
After an hour, the kitten was saved at 
4:30 p.m. 
Once brought to the surface, the dis-
tressed animal was greeted with applause 
and shouts of joy from the crowd that gathered to watch the firefighter’s efforts to save her.
“In all my 20 years, this case is by far the 
most challenging cat rescue,” Lane said. 
“Even though we are not in the animal 
services business, we serve the public, and this was a life that needed to be saved.” 
How the cat got in the drainage pipe is 
still a mystery, he said.   
Walmart employee Diane Brault ad-
opted the kitten on the spot and agreed to quarantine her for 10 days as a precau-
tion. 
“I felt so bad for the kitten that I just 
wanted to take her home and take care of 
her,” she said. 
The kitten’s new name is Wallie, and she 
is reportedly in much better condition.  
“We gave her the name Wallie because 
she was found in the Walmart parking lot,” Brault said with a smile on her face.4, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 16, 2010

� THE SONGBLOOM IPHONE APP LETS 
USERS UPLOAD THEIR OWN TRACKS.
By ALEXANDER KLAUSNER
Alligator Writer
A new iPhone application developed by a UF 
graduate is making it possible for even those who 
don’t know the difference between a C-note and a G-note to write the next hit song.
And for UF students to win some cash.
The application, called Songbloom, was cre-
ated by UF agriculture alumnus Amaury Garcia, 
34, and is based off a music collaboration site of the same name.  
The idea behind Songbloom is for musicians to 
upload tracks over a skeleton track that provides structure. From there, musicians can upload their own guitar, bass, keyboard and vocal tracks for a song. 
One submission is chosen for each instrument 
for a pair of songs that are released each month in two categories — rock and hip-hop.The application mimics the website’s system, 
but instead of users submitting recordings of themselves playing an instrument, users sing the 
melody or part for the song they think up. 
“Non-musicians still have music in them.” 
Garcia said. “They can still interpret melody, just 
not through an instrument.” 
The tracks are then recorded with the real in-
strument by a studio musician.
Until Nov. 27, two current 
Songbloom projects are taking submissions for lead vocals. If 
a UF student downloads the iP-
hone application and submits a winning track, he or she will re-ceive a $200 prize.
The songs are judged by Gar -
cia and his staff, including the studio musicians and engineers. 
The tracks don’t need to be overly fancy or 
technical to be selected, he said.
“It’s purely content and feel of the audio that’s 
submitted,” Garcia said. “It’s how well it suits the song and how much life it gives the song.”Students get shot at songwriting

While college students gen-
erally associate Solo cups with 
gameday fun and hazy week-ends, they may soon be asso-ciating the brand with a more 
philanthropic and ecologically 
friendly type of fun.
After being one of the few 
schools selected to compete by the Solo Cup Company, four UF 
Public Relations Student Society 
of America  members have put together a team for Go Bare on Campus, a case study competi-
tion where students will be com-
peting with other schools across the country to get students to use sustainable products. 
The competition, which be-
gan in October and will continue through Nov. 21, will attempt  to get the most people to pledge on Facebook to “Go Bare,”a play on 
Solo’s new line of environmen-
tally friendly single-use food service products which includes renewable plates, compostable 
plates, recyclable cups and com -
postable cups. 
Rachel Raddatz, treasurer of 
the UF chapter of 
PRSSA,  said she 
was very excited 
about the competi-
tion when she first heard about it. 
“I honestly just wanted to 
compete,” Raddatz said. “This competition is a great way to get our chapter some national recog-nition as well as a great way to 
make $1,000.”Currently, Ohio Northern 
University is in first place with 
255 pledges while UF’s chapter is in second place with 178 pledges. However, they are confident that 
they have what it takes to use 
the most eco-friendly single-use food service products at their school. 
Bridget Bartol, UF’s team 
leader for the Go Bare on Cam-pus by Solo competition, said that she wants to use this com-petition to inform people about 
making better life choices when 
it concerns the environment. She said she believes UF has a very good chance at winning because 
of its size as well as the network-
ing and campaign skills the peo-ple in PRSSA already have. 
“We have such a great public 
relations department and profes-
sors who are all very interested 
in this competition,” Bartol said.Solo touts eco wares on campus

Monday morning was the opening of the week-
long World Humanities Expo at Santa Fe College, 
where exhibits, speakers, food and performances give 
visitors a glimpse of cultures from around the world.
The large activity room is sectioned into areas, 
with Asia, Latin America, the U.S., Africa, Europe 
and world religions each getting a display with a va-
riety of student-created exhibits, including models, 
pictures, paintings and other creative displays.
Rafael Ramos, a 20-year-old English major at SFC, 
said he liked the diversity of the projects.
“I think it’s just to expose people more to different 
cultures,” Ramos said. “By doing that, they help to prevent prejudices because they give people an un-derstanding of what other cultures might be think-ing.”
Event organizer William Little, 
chairman of the Humanities and Foreign Languages Department at 
Santa Fe, said the main purpose of 
the expo is to inspire, educate and entertain.
“My sense is that people don’t have a real feeling 
for what the humanities are,” Little said. “So this is 
meant to concentrate what they are.” 
Little said the displays are all graded projects cre-
ated by Santa Fe students in humanities classes, and he said this is the seventh year for the expo but the 
first year it has been opened up to the local commu -
nity.
Little said the rest of the week will feature promi-
nent speakers such as Dr. Philip Williams, director of Latin American studies at UF, and Nobuho Naga-
sawa, an international artist and professor at Stony Brook University.

� IT ALSO INCREASES THE
 LIKELIHOOD OF GRADUATING.

Students who are social-networking 
savvy may  be ahead of the academic 
curve.
In a recent study, UF psychology alum-
nus Reynol Junco found that Twitter in-
creases grade point averages as well as students’ likelihood to stay at a single uni-
versity until graduation.
The study was performed at Lock Ha-
ven University in Pennsylvania, where 
Junco is an assistant professor. 
He took a group of 125 students who 
did not previously use Twitter from a freshman seminar for pre-health profes-sional majors and split them into two groups, introducing one group to the 140-
character world of Twitter.
Junco spoke to other professors about 
using social media in their classes and 
found that professors favored Twitter over 
other networking sites because there was 
less of a social requirement.
While in these courses, students were 
able to tweet to complete homework and extra credit assignments. 
Junco admitted that he thought Twit-
ter would help students socially but not academically. However, after one semes-
ter, students using Twitter had an average 
grade point average of 2.8 — 0.5 points higher than non-users.
Students were also given a pretest to 
measure engagement — their level of in-volvement and attachment to the universi-ty — before the Twitter experiment began. 
On the post-test, Twitter users showed 
increased engagement, which Junco said 
means they are much more committed to 
the university.
“Engagement is the magic bullet of stu-
dent success,” Junco said. “You have to en-
gage students early in their college career 
to keep them connected to the institution and to keep them successful.”
Jessica Annett, a UF English and Span-
ish senior, said that through Twitter she 
is exposed to conversational and sponta-

iPad, accessories cost about $245 less than printing
In a memo she sent out Oct. 20, she estimated that, on average, 
the cost of paper agendas is $785 annually for each commissioner. 
Purchasing a 16GB iPad with a protective case and extra chargers would cost $540 — that’s $245 less than the paper agendas.
The idea to use the new technology started when Rountree 
brought her birthday present into work. 
Lila Stewart, a strategic planner for the city, had been working 
to make the transition from paper to digital since she started work-ing for the city three years ago. When she saw Rountree showing off her iPad, she thought the new technology might be an interest-ing way to accomplish her paperless goal. 
Stewart said that she later read a case study in the Alliance for 
Innovation Newsletter showing that the introduction of iPads into local governments allowed for convenience, environmental 
friendliness and cost efficiency . 
She forwarded the article to Rountree and the idea took off.But the city commission isn’t the first board in Gainesville to 
implement this type of paperless system.
The UF Board of Trustees started a similar system nearly five 
years ago, but with laptops instead of iPads.
Steve Orlando, UF spokesman, said that for 
the 13 members of the board, printing agendas 
just didn’t make sense. 
Rountree said that the city tried laptops but 
had issues with the costs and size, and the lap-tops would have obstructed the commissioners 
microphones at meetings.
“The convenience of the iPad is what sold 
it —  convenience and portability ,” Rountree said. 
When her husband found out that the city was paying for the 
commissioners’ iPads, Rountree said he wanted to know if that meant she would get a new one and he could have hers.
“I said, ‘No,’” she said with a laugh. IPADS , from page 1The plant will be producing energy constantly
producing reasonably priced electricity 
and diversifying fuel sources, Meale said. 
The company that is developing the 
plant, American Renewables, has been un-derway on the project since 2007 with plans 
to create renewable energy and jobs, said 
Josh Levine, project manager for American Renewables.
“We’re very excited about the judge’s 
decision and are moving along diligently ,” Levine said. “We are hoping to begin con-struction early next year, which will allow us to finish by 2013.”
The energy will be sold to Gainesville 
Regional Utilities under a 30-year power purchase agreement. Diversifying fuel sources is one of the greatest benefits, Levine said. GRU has been criticized by bond rating agencies for not having enough fuel diversity in the past.
Since the new plant will diversify the 
fuel sources, it will increase the financial li-ability of GRU, Levine said. 
Unlike other forms of renewable en-
ergy that require the wind to be blowing or the sun to 
be shining, Levine said, this 
plant can produce energy 
24/7.
The plant will also create jobs. The com-
pany will employ 44 individuals directly and could create up to 700 jobs for the re-gion — anything from hotels and restau-rants to the people that will be making the tires for the trucks, Levine said.
Former Mayor Thomas Bussing, the 
intervener in the hearing, disagrees with Levine and said that the plant will be a fi-nancial and environmental disaster.
The total cost of the contract is estimat-
ed to be more than $2 billion, Bussing said, making the power much more expensive than other forms of energy.
Increased electricity rates, increased 
pollution and emission of dioxins are not something that Gainesville needs, he said.
Instead, he said the next step could be 
taking the case to the citing board. 
“This is merely a recommendation to 
the power plant citing board, and perhaps they will see that this is a flawed decision and remand it for improvement,” he said. 
For now, the GREC group is trying to 
get on the Cabinet’s agenda for the Dec. 7 meeting. If they are successful, they hope to 
have a site certification by early December, 
Levine said. BIOMASS , from page 1“With Twitter, you can be

Today’s question: Are airport security measures too intrusive?
67 TOTAL VOTES39% YES61% NOMonday’s question: Would graphic images impact people’s decision to buy cigarettes?Biomass plant to use ancient technology
Just like they do with old newspapers and aluminum 
cans, Gainesville residents should start to recycle their logic into something more eco-friendly. 
Maybe everyone who opposes the idea of burning 
wood to help save the environment can turn their old, venerated logic into GreenSpeak we can use to fertilize local gardens. 
Turning facts into fertilizer is almost as eco-friendly 
as burning wood to clean the air.
The production of thousands of metric tons of 
Gainesville GreenSpeak holds as much promise as the biomass power plant, and it will cost hundreds of mil-
lions of dollars less than planning a way to power the 
future using caveman technology.
Local politicians and the leadership at Gainesville 
Regional Utilities have already been working on the 
widespread production of all the GreenSpeak they can 
reasonably spew forth, setting an excellent example for the rest of us.
GRU leased 131 acres and the operation of a taxpay-
er-built billion dollar wood-burning power plant to a 
private company from the Northeast at the bargain-
basement price of $100  a year.  
In the contract our local politicians approved, most 
of the details were blacked out, getting rid of all that 
messy “accountability” stuff GRU is always trying to 
sidestep. 
Even the rosiest estimates have our utility rates sky-
rocketing once we build this.
The only way this won’t be the single worst finan-
cial decision Gainesville has ever made will be if federal regulations change in the future to punish coal-burning power plants.The GreenSpeak coming from 
our elected officials, though, is all the information we will need in or -
der to make a sound decision.
Pumping an average of 1.4 mil-
lion gallons a day from the Lower Santa Fe River for the plant’s cool-
ing tower is fine. We have an iron-
clad promise that “some” of the 
water used will be reclaimed water after seven years or so.  
Having 130 diesel trucks barreling down the road 
every day an average of 52 miles away (and back) filled with tons of wood is actually the most sustainable thing we could do.
Since we are relying on Stone Age technology, any-
way, maybe we can equip all the trucks with Flintstones-style foot brakes. 
The air around town will be full of particulates and 
other toxic crap, but who doesn’t love the nostalgic and woodsy smell of a campfire?
Plenty of jobs will be created from the hundreds of 
workers emptying forest floors to the small armada of public relations flacks we’ll need in order to keep con-vincing everyone a power plant built in the 21st cen-
tury should use technology developed when the woolly 
mammoth was still around.
The options for clean energy are all imperfect in their 
own way, and we all have to do our part to conserve and simply live differently in order to construct a cleaner 
future.

Strip down
Airport procedures 
violate civil liberties
“Don’t Tase me, bro” finally has a sister slogan. 
After refusing a full-body scan and then refus-
ing a full-body pat down, a 31-year-old California 
man was thrown out of San Diego’s airport Saturday after say-
ing, “If you touch my junk, I’ll have you arrested.”
John Tyner’s “Don’t touch my junk” tagline had already 
gone viral by Monday morning courtesy of a cell phone video, 
prompting quick response from Transportation Security Ad-
ministration officials to defend its already-controversial screen-ing methods. 
The new pat down rules began Oct. 28 as an alternative to 
the already-deemed intrusive full-body scanners that have been 
called “virtual strip searches” by many . 
The pat-down procedure that Tyner refused involves a same-
sex airport official  conducting a “sliding hand motion” search 
of the passenger’s body , including the groin and breast area. 
TSA and the Department of Homeland Security have re-
peatedly defended the full-body scanners that can peer under clothes as “necessary” to ensure safety, and the pat-down mea-sures, officials said, “serve an important goal.”
After refusing to be violated virtually and physically by 
airport officials, Tyner said he now faces a $10,000 fine for his “junk” ordeal. 
And when any man or woman can face a multi-thousand-
dollar lawsuit because he or she refused to be violated by an air -
port official or be virtually strip-searched, something is wrong. 
Defending the new pat-down procedures, U.S. Secretary of 
Homeland Security Janet Napolitano said the pat downs, which have been labeled as “groping” and “inappropriate” by airplane passengers across the country, protect passenger safety. 
But as Americans grapple with the inevitable relinquishing 
of civil liberties in the name of “safety” today as the holiday season quickly approaches, it becomes clear that no such search method would have discovered the series of printer bombs sent 
from Yemen in late October. 
The main question Americans face is not one of ultimate 
safety — as the Yemen-originated printer bombs did not have 
to pass through an intrusive pat down — but rather: How many civil liberties are we willing to relinquish for the government to 
tell us we’re finally safe?
We strongly recognize that the threat of terrorism is ever-
present as the series of printer bombs has shown us, but we 
also agree that TSA’s pat-down procedures and virtually strip 
searching full-body scans do little if anything to solve terror -
ism’s increasingly intelligent methods. 
Tyner said it best Saturday morning when he told airport of-
ficials, “I don’t understand how a sexual assault can be made a 
condition of my flying.” 
As soon as we become comfortable with legal “sexual as-
saults,” as Tyner described it, we open the dubious doors to routine full strip searches in the name of “safety.” 
In response to Tyner’s refusal Saturday, TSA Chief John Pis-
tole said the new measures provide the “best possible technol-ogy” to detect explosives. Yet Pistole notably disregarded the inability of the new measures to find and discover such bombs as the ones sent from Yemen. 
Stand up for your rights, Gators. Sexual assault should not 
be a requirement for flying. Or you can always report those dis-sidents who want to keep their civil liberties for thoughtcrime.
And, oh yeah, don’t touch my junk.

Gators should stick together
Shame. Shame all around. Shame on the 
team and on the coaching staff, but shame 
on us, too. 
Yes, our team has major issues; no one 
can deny that. But you know who else 
has issues? The fair-weathered fans in the 
crowd Saturday who had the gall to boo 
our quarterback. 
John Brantley is not Tim Tebow. We 
know that. By this point, we know he’s 
not even close to Tebow. But he’s ours. 
You might even think he’s the Ron Zook of 
quarterbacks, but he’s ours. 
You do not boo your own players, 
Gators. Boo Steve Addazio. Go ahead. He’s 
a grown man who needs to get some les-
sons into his skull. 
Boo the other team. It’s a little crass, but whatever. But do not boo a guy who, while perhaps lacking in talent, has patiently and 
graciously waited years for his turn only to see an entire city turn on him. Don’t scourge   Brantley for trying. Either cheer 
for the team you love or shut up and stay 
home.
The team will rebuild. Brantley will 
move on with his life.
 Maybe even Addazio will get fired. But 
we don’t need you mean-spirited hypo-crites there. Shame on you, students.

Cycling safety a two-way street
In reference to Danielle Spatz’s Monday article, I’ve been a cyclist in this town for eight years now, and every single incident 
in which I’ve been close to being hit or actu-ally hit by a car has been on campus. 
Sure, there are a lot of cyclists on cam-
pus, a fair share of them being inconsider -
ate by breaking laws and weaving in and out of traffic with a sense of entitlement. 
However, even those of us who signal 
and stop at lights and stop signs have to contend with inconsiderate drivers, many 
of whom may come from cities with few 
cyclists. It’s hard to be a “defensive biker” when a driver passes you and then immedi-
ately turns without warning. 
I don’t have a horn, so short of throwing 
things at them from my bike, I, like most 
cyclists, have no way to get the attention of a driver with the windows rolled up. If the University Police wants there to 
be fewer accidents, I’d suggest they place signs at the entrances to campus asking drivers to watch out for their two-wheeled 
friends when turning and to yield to bicy-
clists trying to enter traffic just like cars are 
required to do for buses.  
Gainesville prides itself on regularly be-
ing ranked as one of the friendliest cities 
in the nation to cyclists thanks to having 
segregated bike lanes, numerous municipal 
bike racks and a Bicycle Pedestrian Advi-
sory Board that works  with the City Com-mission. 
Now it’s up to the law enforcement as 
well as cyclists to make it one of the safest 
cities as well.

Students concerned their relationships are on the rocks and 
could end soon can gain some insight from a study of Fa-cebook statuses.
A new graphic circulating on the Internet charts the use of 
the phrases “breakup” and “broken up” in Facebook status up-
dates to show what time of the year couples split.
David McCandless, a London-based writer and designer 
who focuses on data journalism and information design, along 
with colleague Lee Bryon, created the data visualization in 2008 by scraping 10,000 Facebook status updates for data.
McCandless exhibited the graphic during a July TED (Tech-
nology, Entertainment, Design) Conference on data visualiza-tion.
He described the graph to the audience, saying, “People 
clearing out for Spring Break, coming out of very bad week-ends on Monday, being single over the summer. And then the lowest day of the year, of course: Christmas Day . Who would do that?”The graphic shows spikes in break-
ups after Valentine’s Day and in the two weeks before Christmas.
There was also a significant spike on 
April Fool’s Day.
Jessica Semin, a freshman pre-nursing student at U. Ne-
braska-Lincoln, said she thinks people may break up more fre-quently in the weeks before Christmas because of winter break for college students.
“Maybe since people are with their friends, and not togeth-
er,” she said.
“During Christmas in college, students go back home and 
see old friends.”
Jesse Barlean, a sophomore at UNL, had a different theory.
“I was actually just talking about this with my friends,” he 
said.
“We thought people break up over Christmas and stay bro-
ken up until Valentine’s Day because they don’t want to buy gifts.”
He thought Spring Break breakups were also explainable.
“No one wants a girlfriend for Spring Break,” he said.Semin said that the Monday breakup spikes seemed likely 
to her.
“Mondays are never a good day for anyone. And it’s com-
ing off a weekend,” she said, adding that sometimes couples have fights over weekend events.
Barlean agreed, saying, “People have bad Mondays.”As for April Fool’s Day , Barlean doubts that more couples 
actually split up on that day.
“On April Fool’s Day, maybe it’s just a joke,” he said.During his TED talk, McCandless uses his visualization as 
an example of the wealth of data available to researchers on the Internet.
“There’s a titanic amount of data out there,” he said. “It’s 
unprecedented.”

� EVENTS WILL BE HELD ON 
CAMPUS ALL WEEK.
By MINA RADMAN
Alligator Writer
Students, faculty and staff are en-
couraged to put out their cigarettes this 
week. 
Starting Tuesday, GatorWell and the 
American Medical Student Association 
will host a variety of events across cam-
pus this week to raise awareness about the dangers of tobacco use and provide resources for those who want to quit.
“The goal is typically to raise aware-
ness,” said Jane Emmeree, a “quit coach” at GatorWell. “We always try to do something locally in conjunction with the national event.”
These events mark the 35th annual 
Great American Smokeout, held nation-wide by the American Cancer Society, which encourages smokers to pick a day to quit. 
“We ask them to consider quitting 
again, if not by the day of smokeout, then by the first of the year,” Emmeree said.
UF has maintained a tobacco-free 
campus policy since July, in which to-bacco use is prohibited across campus. The Office of Student Activities and Involvement addresses students who 
don’t comply with the policy, while em-
ployees’ immediate supervisors address 
any issues.
The GatorWell Health 
Hut will have health re-source materials Tuesday, 
Wednesday and Thursday at the Hub, the Southwest Recreation Center, the Plaza of the Americas and the Reitz 
Union Colonnade.
AMSA will be tabling on the Plaza of 
the Americas Thursday with additional 
resource materials.‘Smokeout’ urges quittingNATIONAL
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
SAN FRANCISCO — The California 
Supreme Court ruled Monday that some 
illegal immigrants are entitled to the same tuition breaks offered to in-state high school students to attend public colleges and uni-
versities.
While the ruling applies only to Califor -
nia, the case was closely watched nationally 
because nine other states including New York and Texas have similar laws.
Republican congressmen Lamar S. Smith 
of Texas and Steve King of Iowa filed a so-called friends of the court brief urging that illegal immigrants be denied the reduced 
rate.
The lawsuit was part of a broader legal 
assault led by the immigration legal scholar 
Kris Kobach, who has filed numerous cases across the country seeking to restrict the rights of illegal immigrants.
A unanimous state Supreme Court, led 
by politically conservative Justice Ming Chin, said the California provision was con-
stitutional because U.S. residents also had access to the reduced rates.
The California Legislature passed the 
controversial measure in 2001 that allowed 
any student regardless of immigration sta-tus who attended a California high school for at least three years and graduated to qualify for in-state tuition at the state’s col-
leges universities. In-state tuition saves each state college student about $11,000 a year and each 
University of California student about $23,000 a year.
The state law also re-
quires the illegal immi-grants applying for the 
in-state tuition to swear they will attempt to become U.S. citizens. The applicants are still barred from receiving federal financial aid.
“Through their hard work and persever -
ance, these students have earned the op-portunity to attend UC,” said University of California president Mark G. Yudof. “Their accomplishments should not be disregard-ed or their futures jeopardized.”Court upholds in-state 
tuition for immigrants

TEEING OFF WITH KYLE MAISTRI POLL QUESTION UF FOOTBALL UF HOSTS OHIO STATE 
TONIGHT AT 6.
By GREG LUCA
Alligator Staff Writer
gluca@alligator.org
 
For weeks the Gators have been 
endorsing their increased physical-
ity . 
Tonight they’ll face their first real 
test. 
After three games of feasting on 
inferior competition, Florida’s big men will be challenged when they 
square off against No. 4 Ohio State 
at 6 in the O’Connell Center. 
“They’re big, they have a lot of 
size, and they’re really athletic,” se-
nior Alex Tyus said. “It’s definitely 
going to be a challenge for us.”
Tyus and seniors Vernon Mack-
lin and Chandler Parsons comprise a frontcourt that led No. 9 UF to a 
36-22 rebounding edge in its season 
opener against UNC-Wilmington, 
but they will face significantly stron-ger competition from OSU. 
The average Seahawks starter 
was 6-foot-5, 195 pounds, while the Buckeyes starters stand at an aver -
age of 6-foot-6, 233 pounds. 
Ohio State put that advantage 
on display in its opening game, out-rebounding North Carolina A&T by an astounding 55-17 margin on its way to a 102-61 victory . 
“I think (Ohio State) has the po-tential to be one of the best rebound-ing teams in the country,” said coach 
Billy Donovan, whose average start-
er is 6-foot-3 and 206 pounds. “They 
obviously have a lot of length and 
size.”
A great deal of that rebounding 
figures to come from freshman Jared Sullinger, a highly-touted recruit who was the consensus No. 1 center 
in his class. 
The 6-foot-9, 280-pound monster 
is a quality passer and has a strong 
face-up game to compliment his dominant post presence. 
“He has really good moves and he keeps his composure,” Tyus said of Sullinger. “He doesn’t play like a 
freshman.”
One way the Gators hope to 
counter the Buckeyes’ bulk is by 
playing an up-tempo style and com-ing at them with a full-court press. 
Florida believes that it can tire out the Ohio State starters if it can keep them out of their normal offensive 
sets and force them to run the floor.
“With their size, we’d rather take 
our chances up there than wait-
ing for them to come up in the half court,” junior Erving Walker said. 
“It’s our style versus their style, and 
we want our style to win out.”
The Gators are also hoping that 
the press will be able to generate turnovers against an Ohio State 
team that usually operates without 
a traditional point guard. 
With the loss of Evan Turner to 
the NBA, the Buckeyes have had to hand the role of primary ball-han-
dler over to junior William Buford, 
who has played mostly off the ball in his OSU career. 
“I think he’s really a two-guard,” 
sophomore Kenny Boynton said. “We definitely have to put pressure on him and try to turn him over.”
The only true point guard on the 
roster is freshman Aaron Craft, who 
recorded nine assists in 22 minutes 
during OSU’s opener. 
UF will be looking to rattle Craft 
and the rest of Ohio State’s top-
ranked recruiting class with relent-
less pressure and deafening crowd noise. 
“For their freshman this will 
be their first time playing in a big game,” Boynton said. “I think we definitely could get to them with our crowd and our intensity.”

Gators look to use press to beat big Buckeyes team
By MATT WATTS
Alligator Writer
 
In 2005 Amanda Butler notched her 
first career victory as the head coach of 
the Charlotte 49ers. On Monday night, she reached another milestone against that very same team. 
The Gators’ 76-70 victory against 
Charlotte (1-1) in the second round of the Preseason Women’s NIT gave Butler her 100th career win. 
“There is absolutely nothing bitter 
about winning, regardless of who you’re playing against,” Butler said. “I’m just thankful to have coached as many good players as I have to reach that mile-
stone.”
The Gators employed 
the same starting lineup 
used against UCF in the 
opener featuring new-
comer Lanita Bartley at point guard and veteran Jordan Jones at shooting guard. Bartley’s second 
start in the orange and blue started much like the previous left off. She drove to the basket early and often, grabbed a couple Butler beats former team

Gators fans could be welcoming 
back some familiar faces next season. 
Despite rumors and criticism, coach 
Urban Meyer said Monday he believes 
UF offensive coordinator Steve Add-azio will be back calling plays next sea-
son. 
And quarterback John Brantley dis-
pelled rumors that he was thinking 
about transferring from Florida.
Addazio has received much of the 
blame for the offense’s struggles. The Gators are currently ranked 82nd in to-tal offense.And if Addazio is the most frequent 
name when discussing the offense’s failures, Brantley isn’t far behind. 
He has thrown eight touchdowns 
and seven interceptions in his first sea-
son as Florida’s start-
ing quarterback.
His inability to run 
the option has led to 
a decrease in play-
ing time as he is now splitting time with two other quarter -
backs. But Brantley 
denied ever contemplating a transfer from Gainesville.Addazio, Brantley expected 
to return despite criticism

 Redskins owner Daniel Snyder gave Donovan McNabb a five-year, $78 million 
contract extension. Imagine how much he would’ve paid for a physically fit quar -
terback who runs the two-minute drill better than Rex Grossman. ... UF QB John 
Brantley didn’t rule out losing to App State this weekend, which got me think -
ing: What level of team would it take for him to guarantee victory at this point? Men’s competitive flag football champs?Today’s question: Do you think 
Steve Addazio is to blame for UF’s struggles on offense?
Vote on alligatorSports.org The start time for the UF-FSU matchup on 
Nov. 27 will be determined later this week. 
The game will either be at 3:30 p.m. on ABC or at 7 p.m. on ESPN or ESPN2. “My dad called me last weekend right when he 
landed back from Nashville (Tenn.),” Brantley said. 
“He didn’t know what was going on, and I had no idea 
either. I haven’t said anything to him about that. He 
has never said anything to me about that. Those are just all rumors.”
Looking for energy on offense: Florida’s offense 
hasn’t just lost three first-rounders in the last two NFL Drafts. Evidently, it’s missing something else.
On Monday, Meyer pointed toward a lack of energy 
as one of the offense’s problems.
“I don’t see an offense full of life,” he said. “I don’t 
see a lot of energy. That’s one thing as a head coach that concerns me. That’s all personnel-based and success-based. And you try to recruit those types of personali-ties (that bring energy).”
The offense is averaging about 29 points per game 
(50th in the nation), and Brantley is the third-worst rated passer in the conference.
Meyer said dual-threat quarterback Jordan Reed’s 
role may expand Saturday to help bring some life to the group.
“[Reed] does provide some energy,” Meyer said. 
“Just the way he plays. You see the energy level, which 
is obviously critical at the center of the offense.”
The freshman completed three of seven passes 
against South Carolina, one of them for a touchdown.
But so far the energy provided by players such as 
Tim Tebow, Maurkice Pouncey, Percy Harvin, Aaron Hernandez and Riley Cooper has not been matched by 
this season’s unit.
“You lose two first-rounders on offense and a lot 
of great players playing in the NFL now,” center Mike 
Pouncey said. “You lose a lot of energy and emotion 
toward the game. Guys that really show while they are playing that they love it and they bring other guys up around them. I think that’s where we were hurting all year.”
Easley back practicing with team: Freshman Do-
minique Easley was not on UF’s travel roster for the Vanderbilt game and his status with the team was in doubt.
But Easley is practicing with the team again as of 
Monday, according to Meyer. 
The defensive tackle has recorded three tackles in 
four games this season. He arrived to Florida as a five-star recruit, according to Rivals.com.  14, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 16, 2010
In Arkansas’ last 
three games, Mal-lett has passed for 927 yards, nine touchdowns and just one intercep-
tion. Sure, the 6-foot-6 junior thrived against the likes of UTEP and Vanderbilt, but he also threw for 303 yards and scored a pair of touchdowns in a 41-20 win against South Carolina two weeks ago. You remember the Gamecocks, right?
Blackmon added Texas to his 
growing list of victims Saturday when he torched the Longhorns for 145 yards and a touchdown. Thus far, Blackmon’s only miss came against Kansas State, and that’s only because he was suspended 
when the Cowboys beat the Wildcats. In the nine games Blackmon has played, the sophomore is averaging 9.3 catches and 159 yards.
James suffered a slight setback last 
week against Cal, when he failed to reach the end zone and was held under 100 yards for just the second time this season. Still, James surpassed former Heisman darling Denard Robinson as the nation’s lead-
ing rusher, and the sophomore can make up for his recent shortcomings against No. 22 Arizona and in the annual Civil War against Oregon State.
Moore’s Heisman hopes follow a similar 
strategy to that of Boise State’s national championship run: Beat up on the little guys while waiting for the big boys to erase each other. And last week, when LaMi-cahel James and the rest of the Ducks came out ﬂ  at against Cal, Moore could 
watch with a smile on his face after posting another ﬁ  ne performance against “rival” Idaho on Friday night. He passed for more than 200 yards and accounted for three touchdowns.
Another week, another laundry list of 
allegations. But unlike many players who are unable to compartmentalize off-the-ﬁ  eld issues, Newton thrived despite them. He looked more emotional during warmups Saturday than he had all sea-son. And he torched UGA, capping Au-
burn’s opening drive with a 31-yard score and ﬁ  nishing the game with more touchdowns (four) than incomple-tions (three, two of which were dropped passes).

FOOTBALL , from page 13
Steven H. Keys / Alligator Staff
UF center Mike Pouncey said the loss of offensive leaders to the NFL has caused a lack of passion and energy on that 
side of the ball for the Gators this season. 
“I don’t see an offense full of life. I don’t see 
a lot of energy. That’s one thing as a head 
coach that concerns me. That’s all personnel-
based and success-based. And you try to 
recruit those types of personalities (that bring 
energy).”
Urban Meyer
UF football coachTUESDAY, NOVEMBER 16, 2010 � ALLIGATOR, 15
Few moments of UF’s beat-
down loss to South Carolina could be described as poet-
ic, but there was at least one.
Early in the fourth quarter, 
Florida’s band struck up Cold-play’s “Viva La Vida.” The Gators 
trailed 29-7 and had just turned 
the ball over on downs, and it would’ve been hard to choose a more appropriate song thanks to the first line:
“I used to rule the world…”And that summed up exactly 
how most of the 90,885 watch-ing Florida get pummeled by 
South Carolina must have felt at 
that moment. Remember when Tim Tebow was running around in The Swamp and a trip to the Southeastern Conference Cham-
pionship felt like a birthright?
Saturday night was a long way from there.
By then, it was clear there 
would be no SEC title, and the re-ality of watching Steve Spurrier’s 
boys romp in The Swamp had set in.
It effectively meant the end of 
the season, and that’s something Gators fans haven’t felt in quite a while. In the last rough year, 2007, Florida still had Tebow’s Heisman Trophy campaign to 
look forward to.
Even in somewhat of a rebuild-
ing year, it was a shock.
But please, hold the tears. This is karma.
No one gets to win all the time. 
Teams have to suck at least occa-sionally for the world to stay bal-anced. 
Sometimes they have a pitiful 
offense and lose a lot.Some-
times they get you-
know-what-
slapped by the Game-cocks.
W h a t 
goes around comes  around, and 
Gators fans were due for some 
bad moments.
So the powers that be had them 
lose to the team that ruined last 
season (Alabama) and then three 
former Florida coaches: LSU’s Bil-
ly Gonzalez, Mississippi State’s Dan Mullen and South Carolina’s Spurrier — men who helped set the standard for exciting UF of-
fenses that this year’s team fell so 
frustratingly far short of.And the loss to the Gamecocks 
was a throwback to the win that started it all. Run back the open-
ing kick and get blown out? 
Sounds like Ohio State in 2006.
Meanwhile, they have to sit 
and watch Cam Newton guide 
Auburn to an 11-0 start and likely 
lock up a Heisman Trophy. They have to dream about what life would be like if Newton was still in Gainesville.
These aren’t coincidences. 
They’re what had to happen, and experiencing this is what makes true fans.
The delirious run of Florida 
athletics from 2006-09 was so much sweeter for those who suf-fered through down seasons, much like how watching my fa-
vorite school win back-to-back 
conference titles was more special after seeing just three wins in a two-year period.
People who enrolled at UF in 
the fall of 2006 and graduated on time (oops) left having seen a total of three national champion-ships, a Heisman and an unde-
feated regular season.
Life isn’t supposed to work 
that way. For those who showed 
up in Gainesville this year: bad timing. You arrived for the pay-
back phase.
And based on the wild success 
of years past, it can’t be over yet.
True, a trip to Atlanta is still 
possible for the Chick-fil-A Bowl, 
but that wouldn’t be the karmic cherry atop this season.
Three bowls match up the SEC 
and Big Ten, and Illinois is a win 
away from being bowl-eligible.
ZOOOOOOOOK!

UF guard Jordan Jones racked up a team-high 19 points against 
Charlotte on Monday.
Jones hit a three to give UF decisive lead
of steals off inbounds plays and sparked the Gators 
to a 12-3 lead in the first four minutes. 
But it was the play of Jones that would propel 
the Gators to a second straight victory and berth in 
the semifinals of the NIT. Jones had a team-high 19 
points on a number of clutch shots, including a 3-of-
5 showing from beyond the arc. 
“[Jaterra Bonds] led us in the first game, and 
then I led us this game, but next game is going to 
be someone else,” Jones said. “It’s a different person stepping up each game, and that makes our jobs a lot easier.”
After substituting into a smaller lineup featur -
ing freshmen Brittany Shine, Deaundra Young and Bonds, the Gators (2-0) extended their lead to 21-7 thanks to the fast tempo Butler and Co. have prom-ised. 
Shine showed off her best John Wall dance moves 
before the game and the impersonation carried over into her performance on the floor. She drained a three on a fast break then grabbed a long pass over the defense for an easy layup after a Charlotte miss. 
Shine totaled nine points in just two minutes to 
propel the Gators to a 14-point lead.
“I just tried to be a little sparkplug out there,” 
Shine said. “I just try to bring energy every time I 
get in [the game].”
But Charlotte fought back, consistently beating 
the interior of UF’s defense with dribble penetration 
en route to 26 points in the paint in the first half. Entering the locker rooms, UF’s lead was down to a 
slim four points.  After the break, Charlotte’s defense began forcing 
the issue, bringing two and three defenders with a 
full-court press.  The teams traded baskets for much of the second half with neither dominating the ac-tion. 
Just 6:55 into the second half, Charlotte took 
its first lead since the opening minutes. But Jones 
stepped up for the Gators once again.
She drained a crucial three-pointer that put UF 
up 53-51 — a lead it wouldn’t relinquish the rest of the way. 
But the game once again was determined in the 
final minutes. Center Azania Stewart snatched two 
key boards and made two free throws in that time to add to her double-double totals of 13 points and 10 rebounds. 
“As long as we keep fighting and that effort stays 
consistent like that, then I feel good about our chanc-es,” Butler said. “I didn’t think we played consistent-ly with toughness until it really, really mattered.
“When you can win ugly, and when you grind it 
out against a good team like that you’ve got to walk away feeling really good and confident.”
Florida’s next game will be in the semifinals on 
Thursday at 8 p.m. against DePaul.WOMEN’S HOOPS , from page 13

AUSTIN, Texas — Texas sophomore 
running back Tre’ Newton, son of former 
Dallas Cowboys lineman Nate Newton, 
announced Monday that he is giving up football after several concussions over his college and high school careers.
Newton missed last week’s loss to Okla-
homa State after sustaining a concussion in a loss to Kansas State on Nov. 6. Team doctors advised him to give up football to avoid long-term problems, Newton said.
Newton said the decision to quit football 
was his, but also said his father told him: “You have to think about the future because football is going to end someday.”
“As much as I love football, this is one of the hardest decisions of my life,” Newton said. “[But] football isn’t forever.”
Newton also sustained a concussion in 
2009, but was still Texas’ leading rusher 
that season with 552 yards. He had rushed 
for 229 yards and three touchdowns this season.
Newton said he had more than one 
concussion in high school. He will stay on 
scholarship and work to finish his degree in 
corporate communications.
“He’s earned his scholarship here,” 
coach Mack Brown said. “He’s a great young man and leader.”
Newton said he doesn’t remember the 
play on which he got hurt against Kansas State. He did not practice last week and met with team doctors and his family a few hours before the Oklahoma State game to make his final decision.
Brown said Newton will remain close 
to the team and could help coach running 
backs next season.
“We try to get them 
in the mainstream [of the 
program] to rebuild their identity. Your concern you 
have is your friends won’t 
look at you the same way. 
You were a guy who could help them win, now you can’t do that anymore,” 
Brown said.
Newton welcomed the chance to stay 
with his teammates, offering to help any-way he can “even if it’s just running to give somebody water.”
Texas senior wide receiver James Kirk-
endoll said the team didn’t know of New-ton’s decision until Monday morning.
“He’s a true teammate and a great foot-
ball player,” Kirkendoll said. “It’s one of the tough things you have to deal with in this sport.”
With Newton’s career now over and 
junior Foswhitt Whittaker nursing a sore shoulder, junior Cody Johnson is listed as the starter for Saturday’s game against Florida Atlantic (4-5). Johnson leads Texas (4-6) with 361 yards and five touchdowns.
Texas must beat Florida Atlantic and 
Texas A&M to become bowl eligible and avoid the Longhorns’ first losing season since 1997.

Dolphins quarterback Chad Henne injured his left knee against the Titans on 
Sunday. His status for Thursday’s game is in question.
NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE

DAVIE — Chad Pennington’s latest shoulder 
injury is “long-term,” but Chad Henne might 
be available for Thursday night’s game against the Chicago Bears, Miami Dolphins coach Tony Sparano said Monday.
The Dolphins signed veteran Patrick Ramsey 
on Monday and placed Pennington on injured reserve. On his first play of the season Sunday against the Tennessee Titans, Pennington re-in-jured his right shoulder, which has already under -
gone surgery three times. 
Third-string quarterback Tyler Thigpen is the 
most likely starter against the Bears after finishing Sunday’s victory over Tennessee when injuries sidelined Miami’s top two quarterbacks.
Injury issues weren’t limited to quarterback. 
Pro Bowl left tackle Jake Long hurt his shoulder, and his availability is uncertain. Like Long, AFC sack leader Cameron Wake (hip) and safety Chris Clemons (groin) finished Sunday’s game on the bench.
“We have a lot of guys bumped up right now,” 
Sparano said. “We’re sorting through it all.”
As Sparano spoke, Henne was in the training 
room being treated for a left knee injury that side-lined him in the third quarter.
Turnaround time is brief for the Dolphins (5-4), 
with only a single practice — today — between games. That makes it less likely Henne will be able to recover enough to start, but Sparano was non-committal.
“We’ll see. Right now we are day to day ,” he 
said. “Tyler will be ready, depending on what Chad Henne does this week.”
Thigpen entered Sunday’s game in the fourth 
quarter and led an 85-yard touchdown drive that sealed the 29-17 win. He went 4 for 6 for 64 yards and a score, a remarkably polished performance considering he has been mostly a spectator at practice this season.
“As a No. 3, that’s what it is — you don’t get 
any reps,” Thigpen said. “The No. 1 gets about 80 percent, and the 2 gets about 20 percent of the 
reps. But the 3 has to just sit back there and men-
tally rep every play.”Dolphins place Pennington on IR, sign Ramsey
“We have a lot of guys bumped up 
right now. We’re sorting through it all.”
