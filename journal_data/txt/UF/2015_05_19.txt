THE FREEWHEEL PROJECT 
HELD ITS FIRST SET OF RACES 
AT ITS OPEN HOUSE SUNDAY.
By Kyle Bennett
Alligator Contributing Writer
A race was at the forefront for many 
people in Gainesville this weekend.
The Freewheel Project held its inaugu-
ral Crit-Cross race Sunday evening on the 
giant, backyard, half-asphalt, half-pave-ment track of the Freewheel Project at 618 
S. Main St.
The races served as a draw for the open 
house that aimed to raise funds for the 
Freewheel Project and allow for potential partners of the Freewheel Project to show-
case themselves. 
There was a general uneasy feel-
ing about the condition of the race track 
among riders who thought the dirt on parts of the track was too loose. However, the 
last-minute inﬂ  ux of participants pushed 
the number of riders up to about 15.
There were four categories a rider 
could enter based on skill and type of bike 
being used for the race: master, ﬁ  xed, open and female.
The cyclists started with a warm-up 
lap, and the timer began immediately after a rider hit the starting line beginning their second lap. 
It stopped after the racers completed 
the lap. 
The fastest time in each category would 
be declared the winner. 
The open category had the most sign-
ups, and therefore, the most money to be won. 
The winner of the open group, Micah 
Hedgecock, won by fractions of a second with a time of 32.35 seconds. He beat out two close competitors (also in the 32-sec-ond range) for the $50 prize. 
Hedgecock made it no secret to his 
competitors that he wasn’t in top form CAMPUS

UF students are earning diplomas at rates 
that rank near the top in the country.
UF is ﬁ  fth nationally among public univer-
sities based on the class of 2013’s graduation 
rate, according to ﬁ  gures from the Chronicle 
of Higher Education with additional data from 
U.S. News World Report.
The University of Virginia holds the top spot 
with a 93.1 percent graduation rate, followed by the University of California at Berkeley (91 percent), University of North Carolina at Cha-pel Hill (90 percent), the University of Michi-gan at Ann Arbor (90 percent) and UF (86.5 percent).
Although the most recent six-year gradua-
tion list has not been ofﬁ  cially published for all of the top ﬁ  ve universities, UF’s graduating 
class of 2014’s six-year graduation rate — the 
rate at which students graduated in six years or fewer — increased to 88 percent, said UF spokesman Steve Orlando.
“We have a universal tracking system for 
students to graduate on time,” Orlando said.
Orlando also cited the recession in the late 
2000s as a time where UF saw its graduation numbers increase.
“Students were expected to graduate more 
quickly because of the hardships their families faced,” Orlando said.
Joseph Spillane, associate dean for student 
affairs, wrote in an email that multiple factors, including the competitiveness of freshman admissions and the investments UF makes in student support, factor into the school’s high graduation rate.  UF graduation 
numbers rank ﬁ  fth in country

George Corwine, John Franklin, 
Bobby Stafford, Chris Avery, Brian Ritter and Paul Hinson rode their motorcycles from Jacksonville Beach to San Diego Beach in 50 hours.Their goal was to raise $20,000 to 
beneﬁ  t Special Olympics Florida, but they met their goal before they even left, Corwine said.
Corwine, one of the founders of 
Coast 2 Coast in 50 Hours, said he estimates the group made between $20,000 and $21,000 but will not know exactly how much until later this week.
The six men left Gainesville 
shortly after 3 p.m. on Saturday for Jacksonville Beach. The ride ofﬁ  cial-ly began Sunday morning at about 3 a.m.
But they didn’t leave without a 
proper send-off from Alachua Coun-ty’s biker community. The 50-hour ride kicked off at the 14th annual Hog Roast at Gainesville Harley-Da-vidson on Saturday afternoon.
All six riders are active or retired 
employees of Alachua County Sher-iff’s Ofﬁ  ce. Their participation in the Law Enforcement Torch Run is what began their fundraising for Special Olympics Florida, Corwine said.
“We tried to think of some way 
to incorporate the fundraiser with something we all love to do, which is ride motorcycles,” Corwine said.

PROFILE
By Melissa Gomez
Alligator Staff Writer
Gavin Doran found inspiration through the 
humans of Gainesville.
The 23-year-old graduated UF in May with 
a bachelor’s in food and resource economics. 
He created and nurtured the Humans of 
Gainesville Facebook page for the past year 
and a half, adding to the already existing one.
But Monday, the UF alumnus left 
Gainesville for southwest Florida to eventually work for Gartner, a technology company he 
interned for.
Doran fell in love with photography after receiving his ﬁ  rst camera. 
As a kid, he was naturally 
creative and used art as an 
outlet.
The Florida native 
moved to Gainesville at 18.
“I started it as more of a 
creative outlet,” he said of 
Humans of Gainesville, and it went from there. 
He chose to paint a portrait of the city with 
his camera.
He met his ﬁ  rst subject at Santa Fe College, 
where a man with a handlebar mustache in the bookstore caught his eye. Doran made his ﬁ  rst post on Jan. 9, 2014.
Through his project, Doran found himself 
humbled by the humans who offered intimate stories and a glance into their lives.
“I learned a lot from the different people 
that I interviewed, a lot about their lives,” Doran said. “I learned a little about myself as well.”
Doran would take a day or two out of the 
week and spend hours looking for subjects.
You have to get used to people rejecting 
you, Doran said, and expect it.
But he found most people were forthcom-ing with their stories, intrigued by his Canon 5D Mark III that he carried everywhere.
“For someone with no formal training of 
photography, his work was stunning,” said John Kaplan, a UF photojournalism professor and one of Doran’s former teachers.
Kaplan, a Pulitzer Prize-winning photo-
journalist, described Doran as a natural talent whose inventive and creative nature advanced his photography. He said Doran’s critical eye to his own photography marks him as an emerg-
ing photographer.
“He possesses a great curiosity,” Kaplan 
said, “and really cares about people.”Humans of Gainesville photographer is leaving town

due to a nagging injury, but had 
he been, he said, “the race would have been much more lopsided.”
Hedgecock’s narrow victory, 
however, was far from the only highlight of the evening. 
Joe Ergle, the announcer and a 
member of the board for the Free-wheel Project, kicked off the fun by leaving his post as color commen-tator, running inside the Freewheel Project building and emerging with a small carriage in tow. 
Executive Director Ryan Aulton 
later topped him by completing his own lap in a freight bicycle that held an additional person. 
Aulton is supported by his three 
board members: his wife, Ergle and Patrick Dodds, who holds a law de-gree and practices real estate law in Gainesville.
“There are unused baseball 
diamonds all over this city and 
zero cycling infrastructure. It’s a 
shame,” said Dodds. “One of our long-term goals is to build a velo-drome here in Gainesville.”
Many of the event-goers found 
out about the open house from lik-ing the Freewheel Project Facebook page and receiving updates via 
their news feed.
Aulton and his board members 
are all in agreement that they in-
tend to hold more events similar to this one in the near future.      
“This is the start of something 
positive,” Aulton said.FREEWHEEL,  from pg 1The project will hold 
more races in the future

syndrome and was a Special Olympics ath-lete for about 16 years.
Franklin rides because of his experiences 
with Special Olympics in high school.
“It struck my heart, and I’ve been in-
volved with it ever since,” Franklin said. “We’re blessed with good health and we all love to ride.”
Franklin founded the Coast 2 Coast ride 
with Corwine in 2011, which was originally called Ride the States for Kids.
The ride raised about $7,000 with two 
riders in 2011 and about $12,000 with four riders in 2012. Injuries prevented Corwine and Franklin from riding in 2013 and 2014, Corwine said.
Title sponsor Gainesville Harley-David-
son, fuel sponsor Lewis Oil Company and additional sponsors have covered all costs for the ride, allowing 100 percent of the money raised to go directly to the Special Olympics programs in Alachua and Brad-
ford County, Corwine said.
Jason Cacciotti is one of Alachua Coun-
ty’s Special Olympics athletes and Athlete 
Leader Representatives.
“I usually bring (my medals) to events 
to show everybody,” Cacciotti said. “My 
goal is to try to compete and get better at the 
events I do.”
Cacciotti has been in Special Olympics 
for 15 years. His favorite memory from Spe-cial Olympics is going to the ESPN Wide 
World of Sports Complex in Orlando and 
competing for medals.
There are already plans to make next 
year’s ride even bigger, Corwine said, adding that next year, they will ride from 
Gainesville to Fairbanks, Alaska. COAST,  from pg 1They raised about $20,000

Florida came in as the No. 7 state for the number 
of international students enrolled in college, with UF 
grabbing the No. 20 spot for universities hosting in-ternational students.
Out of the 886,052 international students that 
came to a U.S. college or university, 36,249 attended a Florida institution, according to the 2013-14 Open Doors study.
The Institute of International Education released 
the annual Open Doors report that tracks where in-
ternational students pursue higher education, as well 
as where U.S. students study abroad.
With an 8-percent growth over the last year, the 
attendance during the 2013-14 school year of inter-
national students nationwide reached a record high, 
making up 4 percent of the total U.S. population in 
higher education.
Steve Orlando, senior director of UF media rela-
tions, conﬁ  rmed by email a total of 6,135 internation-
al students in attendance during the 2013-14 school 
year out of the 50,095 student population.
Rohit Kumar, who graduated this past spring with 
a Ph.D. in electrical engineering, was one of those 
6,135.
The 30-year-old said UF’s research with a super-
computing center made it his top choice.
Kumar said the International Student Services 
provided a great support system for international students.
“In general, you go to them with a problem, and it 
doesn’t matter what it is, they’ll listen and try to help 
you as best as they can in the best manner possible,” 
Kumar said.
Debra Anderson, director of the international 
student services at UF, said UF enrolled roughly the same number of students as the previous year, with only a slight increase.Anderson said the presence of international stu-
dents enhances the whole educational process. A large population of UF international students consists of graduate students, with only about 360 undergrad-uates enrolled during the 2013-14 school year.
“They bring a wealth of cultural diversity,” An-
derson said.
She said international students broaden the world 
view and enhance UF’s international goal.UF No. 20 for international students

Sometimes you 
must teach to learn 
life’s lessons
A troop of four Cub Scouts came to the Alligator office 
Monday looking to get a glimpse at what goes into the day-to-day production of our newspaper.
For about an hour, we gave the 7-year-old boys a 
tour of our office, answered questions and let them 
sit in on our daily staff budget meeting so they could see 
what goes on behind the scenes in the newspaper world.
But while this was supposed to be a learning experience 
for them, a chance for the kids to grasp what we do every 
day (or twice a week over the Summer), they were ulti-
mately the ones who taught us a lesson. 
They showed us the true value of storytelling and whim-
sy. 
The quartet of youngsters walked into the office with 
smiles on their faces and nothing short of enthusiasm, as if they were ready to take on the world with the force of pen 
and paper. 
Their eyes lit up with excitement when they saw the 
newsroom, immediately running to the editor chairs and acting like they had been on the job for years. 
They left their mark in the sports section, showing off 
their physical skills by bouncing an inflatable baseball around the room and playing with foam fingers and memo-rabilia left by editors of semesters past. 
The Cub Scouts looked through our archives, seeing how 
the largest student-run paper has transformed over the de-cades. 
They were vocal in the budget meeting, making it obvi-
ous they thought the Coast 2 Coast story warranted space on the front page and “the dog in the watermelon costume” 
was the best photo we had to offer (and who are we to deny 
a fact like that?).
Put simply, they were naturals.And most importantly, the Cub Scout troop left its mark 
on us.
The visit reminded us that we’re not just writing and 
editing when we come into the office on Mondays and Wednesdays. 
As journalists, it’s our job to inform, whether through 
text, art or a tour through a fraternity-house-turned-news-room. 
We need to be on top of our game, up-to-date on all the 
necessary information and ready to answer any question 
that could be thrown our way — and if the Cub Scouts 
ask, yes, there is an actual alligator in the dumpster outside our office and that’s really where we got the name for the newspaper.
It may seem like something small, but in the end, it’s the 
little things that make the biggest differences.
After all, there is much more to life than deadlines, ex-
ams and paychecks, and we hope that we can remind you of that the same way the Cub Scouts did for us. 
So thank you, Troop 82, for reminding us of the bigger 
picture.Playing the ‘gender card’ not always a bad thing
While being the first woman president 
would be a huge accomplishment, being a woman, by itself, will not get you elected. We know this be-cause the last time Hillary Clinton 
ran for president, she didn’t win. This time around, she has emerged as the only viable democratic candidate, and she has centered her campaign around women’s issues.
Carly Fiorina has repeatedly called out 
Clinton on playing the gender card. But calling people out on playing cards — whether it be the race card or the gender card — is a shoddy way of criticizing them. It discounts all their accomplishments and fails 
to account for how hard it can be to rise through the 
ranks of government when you’re not a white male. The incoming Congress, while it is the most diverse one yet, is still about 80 percent white and 80 percent male. The gender and race card are totally valid cards to play, because we have yet to achieve equal representation in government.
There is nothing wrong with drawing attention to 
inequalities in the system. In fact, who better to draw 
attention to the unique issues that women face than 
a woman president, in the same way that President Barack Obama is able to draw attention to how police brutality affects the black community. Of course, we have to recognize that both Clinton and Obama are both currently much wealthier than the average American, which distances them from a lot of issues.
Men have run for office on platforms that completely 
excluded women’s issues. Why is it wrong for Clinton 
to make these issues the center of her campaign just 
because she is a woman?
Pretending that inequality does not exist doesn’t 
make it go away. We haven’t yet achieved gender equality when it comes to political positions. If there truly were gender equality, it would be impossible to predict whether there would be more men or women within Congress. A woman president would be meaningless, because there would have al-ready been many. As it stands now, a woman becoming president would be a huge accom-plishment, whether that woman is a Republi-
can or a Democrat.
Being proud of your accomplishments in 
the face of adversity is not a negative thing. 
Perhaps some people will vote for Clinton because she is a woman whose campaign is focused on women’s issues. That is a com-
pletely legitimate reason for voting for her. 
Fiorina has also taken a stand on women’s issues, in-
cluding decrying Clinton’s advocacy for women’s rights 
while at the same time taking money from governments 
that deny women rights through her foundation. Even though Fiorina is also a woman, she is erasing that women still face adversity in this country by accusing Clinton of playing the gender card.
Just as Fiorina is allowed to have an opinion on 
women’s issues, so is Clinton. There are many things that Clinton can be called out on, but her choice to center her campaign on women’s issues should not be 
used to discredit her. Over the course of his first term, 
Obama shied away from directly discussing race, for fear of being accused of playing the race card. 
Clinton does have an advantage due to her name rec-
ognition and spectacular lack of viable opponents. Simi-larly, being a woman gives her added credibility when speaking on women’s issues. Perhaps some will end up voting for her because of her focus on issues relevant to women. The voters have a right to make that decision. 
Being a woman does not give Clinton a responsibility 
for tip toeing around these issues. It’s better for women to be leading the discussion on women’s issues. If they get accused of playing the gender card, so what? What other groups do not advocate for themselves?

Gainesville ThrowbacksCAMPUS

A distinguished professor of English at UF 
has a reason to celebrate.
The Southeastern Conference named Sidney 
Homan UF’s 2015 Professor of the Year. This 
award is given out every year to 14 professors, 
one from each school in the conference.
Homan will receive $5,000 and a commemo-
rative plaque with his name at the awards cer-
emony that will be held later this month. 
“I come from a neighborhood where no 
one ever went to college,” Homan said, “so the scholarship is a wonderful thing to have.”Homan joined UF’s Eng-
lish department in 1972 after 
teaching at the University of 
Illinois and Boston Univer-sity.
Paul Richards, a profes-
sor of music composition in the College of Fine Arts at UF and also one of Homan’s good friends, spoke highly of 
Homan.
“Everybody loves the guy,” Richards said. 
“Many students take as many classes as they can with him because they love him so much.”Caitlin Carey, a junior at UF and also a stu-
dent in Homan’s Shakespeare: Learning by Do-
ing class, also called Homan an extremely per-
sonable and caring professor.
“He really gets to know each of his students,” 
Carey said. “If anything, he makes you want to learn and come back each day.”
Homan said the ultimate justiﬁ  cation univer-
sities have is the combination of teaching and scholarship, and that this achievement award simply underscores this principle.
Homan is there watching the Gators play and 
cheering them on in every sport, but that isn’t the main priority, he said.“All of it is secondary to the only real busi-
ness of this college,” Homan said, “and that is 
you and me, teacher and student.” 
Moving forward, Homan said he has no 
plans to retire. Instead, he is trying his hand at 
different things such as writing a ﬁ  ction novel with his son and performing in and directing a play with one of his friends from Purdue Univer-sity in California.
For now, Homan looks forward to continuing 
to teach at UF.
“I love coming into the campus, and I love 
my students,” Homan said, “even though they have lousy taste in music.”UF English professor honored by Southeastern Conference
Homan
May 19, 1978: Bobbie Lisle, 39, became the ﬁ  rst 
woman mayor in Gainesville history. She prioritized 
establishing management by objectives and setting 
long-term directions for her future term as mayor.
May 18, 1978: The tentative student-fee budget 
from Student Government cut funding for “interest groups reﬂ  ecting, sex, race, creed or religion.” The 
plan would cut SG funding from The Black Student Union, the Council of International Organizations, the Cuban Student Federation and the National Or-ganization for Women.
May 18, 2000: UF Student Senate highlighted 
plans to move Senate meetings to student dorms for the Summer A semester in order to better engage 
students. Tentative plans were also in place for dorm 
meetings in future semesters.May 23, 2000: Fireﬁ  ghters from Melrose, Wind-
sor, Hawthorne and Alachua County ﬁ  re depart-
ments combatted a 70-acre wildﬁ  re for more than 
seven hours in the town of Campville, located 15 miles southeast of Gainesville.

The Florida softball team was 
expected to blow all of its oppo-
nents in the Gainesville Regional 
out of the water.
But as is often the case in post-
season play, the No. 1 seeded 
Gators had to grind out three vic-
tories against FAMU, Hofstra and 
FAU respectively to advance to the Super Regionals.
Florida’s two-headed monster 
in the circle of Aleshia Ocasio and 
Lauren Haeger carried the Gators 
in all three of their games. 
The lineup, however, was in-
consistent in two of the three 
games in the Regional.
Ocasio was brilliant in her 6-0 
victory against the Rattlers as she 
tied Renise Landry’s program re-cord for strikeouts in a game. 
Landry’s 17 punch-outs came 
in eight innings, while Ocasio’s came in seven.
Coach Tim Walton wanted 
more consistency from his lineup, especially in the middle of the 
order, heading into the second 
game versus Hofstra.
And they were able to deliver for Walton, as Haeger, Bailey Cas-
tro, Nicole DeWitt and Taylore 
Fuller went a combined 8-for-16 at the plate with two home runs 
and five RBI in Florida’s 7-0 win 
over the Pride.Haeger had one of her more ef-
ficient starts of the season in the 
circle as she tossed a complete 
game, allowing just three hits and striking out eight.
And then came the final game of the Regional against FAU.
The Owls pushed the Gators to 
the brink, forcing extra innings. 
Florida would eventually pre-
vail 1-0 as Haeger crushed a go-ahead RBI double in the top of the 
eighth.
Haeger was once again fantas-
tic in the circle for the Gators. 
The Peoria, Arizona, native  
went the distance for the second time in as many days to get her 
second shutout of the Regional.
Now a matchup against the 
Kentucky Wildcats awaits the 
Gators this weekend. 
Kentucky won the South Bend 
Regional after going 3-0 and beat-
ing No. 16 Notre Dame 4-3 on Sunday. 
Florida and Kentucky met 
during the regular season in Gainesville, with the Gators sweeping the Wildcats on April 
11-13. 
UF leads the all-time series 45-
13 against Kentucky, including a 
23-6 advantage in Gainesville.
Beating a team five times in a 
single season is hard within itself, something Walton is aware of. 
Kentucky will challenge UF by 
possibly using its full arsenal of 
pitchers during the series. 
The team that wins two games 
during the Super Regional will 
move on to Oklahoma City for the Women’s College World Series.

Despite inclement weather that hung 
over the 2015 Southeastern Conference 
Outdoor Championships, the Florida men’s track and field team didn’t let any rain fall 
on its parade. 
On Saturday night, the No. 3 Florida 
men’s track and field team became the first 
Mike Holloway-coached squad to sweep 
both the SEC indoor and outdoor meets, as 
the team left Starkville, Mississippi, as SEC outdoor champions.
Florida entered the weekend ranked be-
hind two SEC opponents—Texas A&M and 
LSU, respectively—and proved themselves 
worthy to be in the conversation for the na-tion’s top spot after scoring more than 30 team-points than both the Aggies and Ti-gers.
The men entered the final day of the con-
ference meet with just a three-point lead 
over No. 9 Georgia—highlighted by SEC 
individual title wins from 
Stipe Zunic in the shot put, Marquis Dendy in the long 
jump and Eddie Garcia in 
the 10,000-meter run.
Saturday saw the Gators 
pull away from the pack, 
as the team scored 80.5 
points to amass a total of 
130.5 team-points for the meet.
Dendy helped lead the way during the 
final day in Starkville, capturing his sec-ond SEC triple jump title of the year. His 
17.35-meter jump set a new SEC record.
This year, Dendy has swept both the 
triple and long jump events at the SEC in-Gators claim SEC Outdoors

The Florida men’s basketball team has 
signed three incoming freshmen to National Letters of Intent who will join the team for 
the 2015-16 season, giving new coach Mike 
White his first recruits as head coach of the Gators.
KeVaughn Allen, a 6-foot-3 guard out of 
Little Rock, Arkansas, originally commit-ted to former coach Billy Donovan in 2014. When Donovan announced he was leav-ing UF to coach the NBA’s Oklahoma City Thunder on April 30, Allen’s stepfather an-nounced that Allen’s request to be released from his commitment was “coming”. 
However, following a meeting with 
White, Allen reportedly decided to remain committed to Florida.
“I understand having second thoughts,” 
White said on May 11. “I’m not into beg-ging. I think this place to a certain extent sells itself.”
The Gators will also add Kevarrius 
Hayes, a 6-foot-9 power forward from Live 
Oak, next season as well. 
Hayes is a four-star recruit according to 
ESPN, and he is ranked in the top 80 of the 
ESPN100 recruit rankings for the 2015 class 
along with Allen and Florida’s final incom-
ing freshman, Keith Stone.
Stone is a 6-foot-7 forward out of Deer -
field Beach, who, like Allen, chose to re-main with the Gators after meeting with 
White. UF signs freshman class

With the top-ranked UF softball team 
already in the midst of the NCAA Tour-
nament and the sixth-ranked UF baseball team beginning postseason play in the Southeastern Conference Tournament on 
Wednesday, the alligatorSports staff will 
be busy live-tweeting the events over the next month. 
Here are some specialty hashtags our 
writers will be using when covering the teams.
Softball
#KirstiMerrittHBPCount:  If there’s 
one thing Kirsti Merritt has been able to do this season, other than constantly smiling, it’s getting hit by pitches. 
The junior center ﬁ  elder has been hit 32 
times this season. 
To give some perspective, her 32 hit-
by-pitches is more than three Southeastern Conference teams have in total: Arkansas (22), LSU (23) and Alabama (24). 
She was on a record pace at the begin-
ning of the season, but she’s been trending downward in that department. 
However, we still like to tweet it out 
whenever it occurs.
#BeepBeep:  This is a relatively 
new one that involves outﬁ  elder Justine McLean. 
The Rancho Cucamonga, California, na-
tive is known for one thing: her speed. 27 
of her 28 hits this season have been singles, 
with a majority of them being inﬁ  eld hits.
I can probably count on one hand how 
many times McLean has hit the ball out of the inﬁ  eld this year. So of course, the 
hashtag is based off the “Road Run-ner” cartoon.
For all the soft-
ball updates, fol-low Luis Torres 
(@LFTorresIII)  
and Patrick Pinak (@Pinakk12).Baseball
#BuntingIs-
Winning:  This 
hashtag had a lot more relevance last season, when the Gators dropped 
down 37 sacriﬁ  ce 
bunts in the sea-son compared to 18 this season. But now that Florida is starting postsea-
son play and one run could be the differ-ence, expect some bunts to actually result 
in winning.
#SullyMeetingOnTheMound-
Count:  UF baseball coach Kevin O’Sullivan 
likes giving fans their money’s worth and 
making sure they are in the stadium as long as possible. 
One way of doing this is playing match-
ups with his pitching staff. He’s not afraid to throw ﬁ  ve, six or even seven pitchers if it means a win at the end of the night (see UF’s 14-8 win against FSU on March 17 as a prime example of this). 
We want you, the reader and loyal 
Gator fans, to know just how many times good ‘ole Sully steps onto the mound to talk to his pitcher, whether it’s to calm his 
starter down or to replace a reliever who 
was brought in with the sole intention of intentionally walking a batter.
These hashtags can be seen on the ac-
counts of Jordan McPherson (@J_McPher-son1126) and Ian Cohen (@ICohenB).
Home-run worthy hashtags
And of course, each team has its share 
of home-run hitters and each of those play-ers has a specialty name or two of his or her own. Here are a select few:

NO. 4 SEED FLORIDA WILL PLAY 
THE WINNER OF ARKANSAS AND 
TENNESSEE ON WEDNESDAY.
By Ian Cohen
Alligator Staff Writer
@icohenb
Kevin O’Sullivan has one hope entering 
the Southeastern Conference tournament this 
week — that his team saved its best baseball for the end of the year.
Florida ended the regular season by 
winning its last three series, a feat it hadn’t achieved since 2012, when UF was knocked out by Vanderbilt in the semiﬁ  nal.
But unlike in 2012, No. 4 seed Florida has a 
ﬁ  rst round bye this year. 
On Wednesday it will play the winner of 
No. 5 seed Arkansas and No. 12 Tennessee, as UF looks to win the SEC tournament for the second time during O’Sullivan’s tenure.
“I think when you get to this time of year, I 
think it’s a great tournament to kind of measure where you’re at,” O’Sullivan said during a SEC coaches’ teleconference on Monday.
Offensively, Florida ranks near the top of 
the SEC. 
The Gators ended the season third in the 
conference in batting average (.293), second in home runs (50) and fourth in runs scored 
(361).Much of UF’s offensive success has been 
the product of a breakout season from senior 
Josh Tobias and contributions from several freshmen, as well as consistent hitting throughout the lineup. Tobias leads the team and is sixth in 
the SEC with a .366 batting average, while freshman catcher JJ Schwarz leads UF with 14 home runs.
“We’ve been fortunate over the years to have some freshmen come in who have held their own. Obviously those three guys have had great years,” O’Sullivan said of UF’s three starting freshmen: Mike Rivera, Dalton Guthrie and Schwarz. 
“Mike and JJ have done such a good job 
defensively, and obviously JJ (is) controlling 
the bat so well as a freshman.”
But Florida’s biggest strength has been 
its defense, anchored by Richie Martin at 
shortstop and Tobias at third base. The Gators lead the nation with a .985 ﬁ  elding percentage and have recorded the fewest errors (32) in the SEC.
“(Martin) is as good a player as I’ve ever 
coached defensively,” O’Sullivan said. “This 
year he has made the routine play, he has 
made the great play, he has shown range both right and left. I think his internal clock is so much more advanced now than it was.”
O’Sullivan added that he is pleased with 
how sophomore starting pitchers Logan Shore and A.J. Puk have played as of late — the two have a combined 29 strikeouts and just 11 walks over their last two appearances.
However, O’Sullivan said that right-hander 
Dane Dunning (5-2, 3.54 ERA) will start on Wednesday as UF attempts to win the SEC tournament for the ﬁ  rst time since 2011.
“The league is as deep as it’s ever been,” 
O’Sullivan said.
 “…If you don’t play clean you’re gonna 
end up back on the bus going home.”TUESDAY, MAY 19, 2015   ALLIGATOR   15

The No. 5 Florida women’s tennis team had its season come 
to a close in the NCAA quarterﬁ  nals on Sunday, falling 4-3 to 
No. 4 Vanderbilt at the Hurd Tennis Center at Baylor University in Waco, Texas.
After the Commodores squeaked out the doubles point, Flor-
ida responded in commanding fashion, winning the ﬁ  rst three singles matches to take a 3-1 lead. With three matches left to play, the Gators needed to secure just one more singles match to advance to the NCAA semiﬁ  nals.
But junior Brianna Morgan couldn’t get the win on the No. 3 
court and freshman Peggy Porter let a second set lead slip away, 
giving Vanderbilt an opportunity to overtake the Gators — a chance the Commodores capitalized on.
“We were up 3-1 on them and they needed to win the re-
maining three matches to beat us, and they did,” coach Roland 
Thornqvist said in a release. “You just have to give them all the credit in the world. Vanderbilt was outstanding at the end.”
Despite the loss, four Gators will see their seasons continue 
at the NCAA Singles and Doubles Championships that begin Wednesday. 
Morgan, Brooke Austin, Josie Kuhlman and Kourtney 
Keegan will compete for the individual title while Keegan and Austin will battle as a duo for the doubles title.UF closes season with loss to Vandy in NCAA Quarterﬁ  nals

doors, NCAA indoors and now, 
last weekend’s SEC outdoor meet. 
Saturday’s triple jump vic-
tory comes one day after Dendy passed on two of his six attempts in the long jump event.
“I had a big chip on my shoul-
der coming into today with all the fouls I had yesterday,” Dendy said in a release. “So it feels great to set the SEC record and I feel really good about today.”
Senior sprinter Dedric Dukes 
also pitched in on Saturday, win-ning the 200-meter title in just under 20 seconds, clocking in a 
19.99-second mark.
Dukes was also part of the 
men’s 4x4—along with Nick 
Uruburu, Najee Glass and Ar-man Hall—that clinched the SEC title with a NCAA-leading 
3:01.60-minute mark. 
The two titles over the week-
end was a vast improvement 
from the 2014 conference outdoor meet, which ended in zero victo-
ries for Dukes.
“Last year I came here and fell a little bit short, so to come here and win as a senior means a lot to 
me,” Dukes said in a release.
While the women’s side did 
not win the SEC championship, the Gators gathered two SEC titles 
during the weekend—one indi-
vidual title and one relay title.
In her first SEC outdoor meet, 
senior sprinter Kyra Jefferson 
completed her sweep of the 
200-meter event in SEC competi-tion with a 22.39-second victory on Saturday. 
The result stands as the best 
time in UF history.
Jefferson also took part in the 
4x400-meter relay contingent that won the SEC title in the event on 
the same day. 
The foursome of Jefferson, 
Robin Reynolds, Destinee Gause 
and Claudia Francis finished the race in 3:27.84—good for the top 
mark in the nation.
With five of the six individual 
men’s and women’s titles won by 
seniors in their last SEC Champi-
onships of their college careers, 
Dukes summed up the perfor-mance with four simple words:

The University of Florida men’s golf team 
is heading back to the NCAA Championship 
Tournament. First-year head coach JC Deacon and the Gators finished the NCAA Regional in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, at 9-under-par 
locking up a fourth place finish.
The Gators are returning to the NCAA Men’s 
Golf Championship for the first time since the 
2012-2013 season when they finished 25th out of the 30-team field. The National Champion-ship tournament will be at The Concession Golf Club in Bradenton, Florida, on May 29 to June 3.
“We’ve come so far from that first tourna-
ment where we were in last place after the first round by 12 shots,” Deacon said in a release. “So much dedication and hard work and time 
has gone into this, and I’m just so happy for 
the guys, especially for the seniors getting to play in a national championship their last year and the freshmen getting to play in their first, and A.J. (Crouch) and Ryan (Orr) getting to play in their first, too.”
Entering the final round, the Gators sat in 
fourth place at 3-under-par and would need every shot to lock up their National Champion-
ship berth.
Orr, a sophomore, who tallied his career-best performance on Saturday, led the Gators 
in Round 3 where they shot 6-under-par.
He shot a 4-under 68 in Round 3 and fin-
ished the tournament tied for 32nd at 2-over-par.
“We’ve been kind of frustrated – both of 
us – all year because we couldn’t really figure out why he wasn’t breaking through because he was playing so well at home and doing ev-erything he needed to do to shoot the scores,” Deacon said. “They just weren’t showing up in tournaments. He just stuck with it, showed resilience and played his best round as a Gator on the most important day as a Gator.”
Crouch secured a share of ninth after shoot-
ing 3-under-par for the tournament and even 
par in both rounds 2 and 3.
The junior’s ninth-place finish marks his 
fourth top-10 performance of the season.
Seniors J.D. Tomlinson and Eric Banks both 
shot 1-under-par in Round 3 finishing tied for 
13th and 49th, respectively.
Tomlinson’s share of 13th marks the 10th 
time this season the senior earned a spot in the top-25 of a tournament.
