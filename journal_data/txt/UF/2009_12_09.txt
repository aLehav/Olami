Students thank Tebow
0 CREATORS OF WEB SITE HOPE TO
GET 1,000 POSTS BY SUGAR BOWL.
By CARLY BLUSTEIN
Alligator Contributing Writer
The UF Student Body has a graduation
present for its beloved quarterback -a digi-
tal yearbook signed by 1,000 of his greatest
admirers in the form of a new Web site.
The site, which was launched by two UF
students, is called DearTimTebow.com, and
is a compilation of thank-you posts express-
ing gratitude toward Tim Tebow and all he
has done for the Gators over the past four
years.
After Saturday night's loss to the Univer-
sity of Alabama, Facebook lit up with bitter-
sweet statuses by UF students who wanted
to share their grief over the game and convey
their appreciation for the team's efforts.
Dozens of Facebook groups popped upin the aftermath of the game, including one
titled "We love you, Tebow, thanks for the
memories," which has more than 17,000
members. The group's wall is flooded with
warm wishes and romantic
confessions for Tebow.
Matt Hobbs, a senior
marketing major, snapped
out of the post-loss depres-
sion quickly enough to seize
an opportunity to provide a
cohesive medium for stu-
dents to post thank yous to
Tebow and the rest of the team.
Less than an hour after the game ended,
Hobbs bought the domain name and called
his friend Joel Hackman, a senior economics
major, to ask him if he would design the site.
Hackman is the webmaster, founder and co-
owner of Gator Tutoring.
Since Hobbs knew so many people idol-

Maybe it's because they work
at the No. 2 party school in the
nation, but UF's library staff takes
partying pretty seriously.
They almost treat it like a job.
In fact, they even form a com-
mittee each year whose sole pur-
pose is to plan the end-of-the-year
holiday party.
It's called, appropriately, the
Holiday Party Planning Commit-
tee. It has 10 members, including achairwoman, who meet a handful
of times from October to Decem-
ber.

mittee, there's a des-

Resident assistant gets unwanted visitor
A 19-year-old Tampa man visiting his friend at UF was
trespassed from campus Tuesday after he was found sleeping
in a residence hall assistant's room after urinating in the dorm
hallway.
The man told campus police when they met up with him
at Murphree Hall that he thought he had been sleeping in his
friend's room, which was one floor up, and said he relieved
himself in the corner of the hallway after wandering around
and trying to locate the bathroom unsuccessfully.
The police report noted that the man was intoxicated.

STUDENT GOVERMENT
Senators pass resolution on Middle-East conflict
By CAROLYN TILLO
Alligator Writer
After several weeks of debate,
the Student Senate finally passed
a resolution related to the conflict
in the Middle East on Tuesday.
Senators joined Gators for Is-
rael's president Rafael Yaniz in
presenting a revised version of a
resolution affirming support for
the state of Israel. It passed 56-9.
A resolution is a piece of leg-
islation that states the Senate's
opinion but takes no action.
"While we're doing this we
could be discussing the Re-
itz Union fee. We could be
discussing student safety."
Jon Ossip
Orange and Blue Party Sen.
The original resolution, pre-
sented at the Nov. 3 Senate meet-
ing, asked the U.S. Congress to
oppose the Goldstone Report,
which accuses Israel and Hamas
of war crimes during last win-
ter's Gaza conflict.
Rafael Yaniz, president of
Gators for Israel, said the revised
resolution no longer contains the
clause regarding the Goldstone
Report.Instead, it now advocates a
two-state solution to the Middle
East conflict to be negotiated be-
tween Israel and Palestine.
Yaniz said the ability of thegroups to work together shows
the U.S. Congress and the com-
munity that students care about
international issues.
Alex Kattan, vice president ofStudents for Justice in Palestine,
said the group did not have a
problem with the content of the
resolution but felt the Student
Senate should not be voting on an

Student Senators Alan Yanuck and Jesse Sherman stand with other authors and sponsors as they pres-

implications.
He said the resolution could
lead students to draft similar res-
olutions about other states.
He said these other resolu-
tions seem unnecessary when it's
understood that students sup-
port the values of democracy and
freedom.
"We as a group are not sup-
porting the resolution," Kattan
said. "We are not opposing it ei-
ther."
Senators had mixed opinions
about voting on a resolution
about an international issue.
Orange and Blue Party Sen.
Jon Ossip, who represents the
Murphree Common Area, said
Senate should be voting on issues
that it actually has control over.
"While we're doing this we
could be discussing the Reitz
Union fee," Ossip said. "We could
be discussing student safety."
Unite Party Sen. Ben Meyers,
who represents the sophomore
class, urged senators to support
the resolution.
"It's inclusive and recognizes
the needs and desires of both Is-
rael and Palestine," Meyers said.
Meyers said the resolution will
be sent to Florida members of the
U.S. Congress.

Frozen yogurt shops draw students with healthier snack
By KATHRYN STOLARZ
Alligator Contributing Writer
Thomas Knight has gone to YogaBerry
nearly every day since it opened in mid-
September.
"It's totally, awesomely delicious," the
economics Ph.D. student said while eating
his typical order -a small, fat-free straw-
berry frozen yogurt.
Knight used to indulge in dessert once
or twice a month, but he doesn't feel guilty
frequenting the newest frozen yogurt place
in town. At YogaBerry, inside Target Copy
on West University Avenue, a small frozen
yogurt has no fat and 125 calories.
Knight is one of many Gainesville resi-
dents catching on to the national trend to-
ward frozen yogurt.
According to a 2009 Ice Cream Business
Trends report from Franchise Direct, the
snack has been gaining popularity.
"Tart frozen yogurts have made a ma-
jor come back. with a focus now on the
healthier aspects of the dessert," according
to the report. "These include lower levels
of fat, pro-biotic properties and 'healthy
toppings' like fresh fruits and cereals."
Gainesville has proven to be an ideal
breeding ground for the craze.
"College towns are much
Local more aware of health and
NewS nutrition, and [students are]
much more interested in
learning and taking care of themselves,"
said Verna Groger, a dietitian for Haven
Hospice.
Mochi opened in May, and three more
frozen yogurt shops are coming soon. A
second Mochi is scheduled to open in Jan-
uary in the new Hampton Inn and Suites
downtown, and another YogaBerry opened
in November in The Oaks Mall. Tutti Frutti
is scheduled to open soon at 1232 W Uni-
versity Ave. Lollicup, which opened in
2006 on Southwest 34th Street, also sells
all-natural, fat-free frozen yogurt.
All of these stores offer fruit toppings
and flaunt the nutritional benefits of their
yogurt on their Web sites.
YogaBerry claims to be "as tasty as it is
healthy." Mochi calls its nonfat, low-calorie
frozen yogurt a nutritional dessert alterna-
tive that promotes good health.
"I wouldn't say it's good for you, but
it's better as a dessert than so many other
things," Groger said.
While frozen yogurt contains live cul-
tures -good bacteria that boost your im-munity -Groger said sugar reduces im-
mune response for up to six hours after it is
consumed by promoting free radicals and
inflammation, canceling out the benefits of
the live cultures. Mochi has a lot of regular
customers and makes about 700 sales on a
typical Friday, which is higher than expect-
ed, manager Sarah Papa said.
"A lot of students have moved from
regular ice cream to frozen yogurt," Papasaid. "I think more people are being health
conscious because there is a rising rate of
obesity in the U.S., plus in Gainesville, col-
lege students want to look good."
After looking at the nutrition informa-
tion, Groger said Mochi and YogaBerry are
good alternatives to high-fat ice creams,
and they're a lot lower in calories.
"But you might caution that these aren't
healthy on their own," Groger said. "These

smoothie with peanut butter and a banana for a customer Sunday evening.also still have a lot of sugar and are still
damaging to your body and promote heart
disease, among other things, and are best
for an occasional treat."
YogaBerry's small, 5-ounce serving has
125 calories and 25 grams of sugar, and
Mochi's 4-ounce serving has 110 calories
and 22 grams of sugar. Groger said the
calorie counts are reasonably low for a des-
sert, but the amount of sugar is relatively
high.
UF freshman Allison Archer goes to
Mochi once or twice a week. Although
she said she wouldn't eat two ice-creams
in one day, she wound up eating at Mochi
and Ben & Jerry's within a few hours of
each other because she considers Mochi to
be healthy.
"This is the bad thing about these plac-
es -they promote themselves as healthy,
but they're just healthier than the worst
thing," said Groger. "All these things are a
lot healthier than other alternatives like ice
cream, but they themselves are not health
foods. .they are healthier treats. If some-
one has a good diet and has one of these
treats one or two times a week, they are a
better option than ice cream."
But Gainesville residents haven't lost
their taste for traditional ice cream.
Pete Zimek, co-owner of Ben & Jerry's,
said sales for the University Avenue store
have remained the same and sales for the
Archer Road store have increased since last
year, despite Mochi opening up nearby.
He doesn't think Ben & Jerry's will be
driven out of business by the new frozen
yogurt stores because it serves a different
purpose.
"People come to Ben & Jerry's for that
vacation," Zimek said.
UF political science freshman Breanne
Palmer went to Ben & Jerry's with a friend
as a reward for studying before taking a
statistics exam. "We'll probably go into a
sugar coma (during the test)," she joked
while eating the Brownie Special.
But even Ben & Jerry's altered its menu
in response to customers' increased health-
consciousness. The store reformulated its
smoothie line in 2008, reducing the calorie
count to 250 calories or fewer per smoothie
and making them low- or no-fat.
Zimek said he discussed customers'
shifting demands toward wanting health-
ier options as a member of the Franchise
Advisory Council representing Ben & Jer-
ry's in the U.S. and Canada.
"It's definitely a global trend," he said.

j Students 'represent' social issues for class
By ALISON SCHWARTZ
Alligator Writer
Zachary Merson paid homage to his girlfriend
and his chocolate Labrador retriever Tuesday
night through a performance that would have
raised the eyebrows of Tupac and Biggie Smalls
alike.
"My bitch is brown," he rapped, "but my
lady is white."
Merson was one of 10 performers at Hip Hop
Live & In Full Effect, a showcase of the final proj-
ects of the political science students enrolled in
Hip Hop and Western Political Thought.
The class aims to explore the political under-
tones of hip-hop, a concept professor Michelle
Smith described as an incredible force.
"Hip-hop becomes this kind of creative
force," said Smith, who teaches the course.
But when she's in the classroom, relaying
the themes from this international music scene
to her students, she also goes by MC Professor
Smith.
A disc jockey stationed in the corner of the
room laid down the beats to a crowd of about 60
as students spit out rhymes about soldiers over-
seas, the degradation of women in the hip-hop
scene, love and, of course, Labrador retrievers.
Josh Albert, who performed a series of songs
with an R&B flavor, said his decision to perform
in the showcase was a reflection of his passion
for music, the same passion that piqued his in-
terest in the course.
"Sometimes when I'm down, singing helps
me release emotion," the political science junior
said.
Student art projects lined the wall, each in-
spired by a hip-hop theme. From a graffiti-splat-
tered brick wall to a painting depicting the fe-
male stereotype of the culture, each visual was
accompanied by a paper explaining the message
of the piece.
And through whatever medium chosen,
Smith encouraged students to represent.Demetri Morgan reads his spoken word final project to a crowd during Hip Hop Live and In Full
Effect, the Hip Hop and Western Political Thought classes' final project presentation.
"Many rap songs start with an artist saying
'Represent, represent,"' Smith said. "It occurred
to me that they mean a lot of different things
when they say it."
This observation ties back to the course, where
students learn the implications of this concept.
"Representation is an incredibly important
concept in Western political thought and the
ways in which we think about government,"
Smith said.
In accordance with the class, the performanc-
es paralleled this theme."It's kind of like representing your commu-
nity, your culture, yourself," Albert said.
Josh Kelly, a political science senior, support-
ed his classmates from his seat in the audience.
While the long-time hip-hop fan wasn't ready
for his freestyle debut, he said the class has
helped him appreciate the culture behind this
genre.
"When most people think about hip-hop they
only think about rappers," Kelly said. "We spent
a lot of time learning about different artists, from
different regions, from different cultures."
Conference's goal is to
create Kyoto successor

of the emerging leaders on
low-carbon economic devel-
opment initiatives."
"We need to act not just
because of the threat to our
environment and our climate,
but also because I believe
there are many opportunities
that will come of that action,"
Hanrahan said.
Hanrahan's goal at the
meeting is to learn about op-
portunities and business in-
terests that she can bring back
to Gainesville. She will also
communicate Gainesville's
sustainability achievements
to green industries that may
not have heard about such a
small city, she said.
"Gainesville has a wonder-
ful story to tell," Hanrahan
said.
The biggest project going
on in Gainesville is the re-synchronization of traffic sig-
nals in an attempt to reduce
congestion and travel time
through town, she said.
Once the project is com-
plete, a typical trip in
Gainesville is projected to
take 15 percent less time,
Hanrahan said. Traffic light
efficiency will lead to less
sitting at lights, which will
cause fewer carbon emissions
from cars.
"We're really committed
to. reducing carbon emis-
sions in our city," Hanrahan
said.
According to the EPA Web
site, the goal of the Copenha-
gen conference is to negotiate
a successor to the Kyoto Pro-
tocol, the first international
agreement to reduce green-
house gas emissions.
"It's not a matter of wheth-
er carbon will be regulated,"
Hanrahan said. "It's a matter
of when and how."Web site created to show support after loss

Unsliced ham causes great deal of struggle

different.
In another departure from last year's festivi-
ties, there will be no more chocolate fondue, the
committee decided on Nov. 5.
It was simply too messy. The ax fell on glitter
snowflakes for the same reason.
The holiday ham also proved to be a bit of a
problem, "because staff members spent a great
deal of time struggling to slice it," the minutes
from the Oct. 23 meeting read.
"As a result it was suggested that the extra
money be spent to purchase presliced ham," the
committee decided.
Another issue tackled by the committee was
whether the Gingerbread Centerpiece Contest
should require entries to have a certain percent-
age of gingerbread to be eligible.
The consensus was no. "[Alnything Ginger-
bread and edible," was the final edict.
Asked why a committee was necessary to de-cide these things, library spokeswoman Barbara
Hood said it's hard work planning a party for 200
to 300 people.
"It's just not the type of party one or two peo-
ple would plan," Hood said. She asked that the
location of the party -scheduled for Thursday
-not be disclosed because it is for library staff
only. She also said the $2,500
party budget comes from pri-
vate funds.
UF spokesman Steve Orlando
praised the open nature of the
planning process.
"There are no secrets, and
everybody knows what's going
Orlando on, he said jokingly.
He also said library staff were
providing a good example for students. With all
the planning that goes into the party, there's less
of a chance it will get out of hand, he suggested.
"I know you're not gonna see Jell-O shots
there, let's put it that way," he said.D

6, ALLIGATOR U WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 9, 2009
It's not only the end of the week here at the Alligator, but
the end of one great semester. We laughed, we cried. we
got called names, and we cried some more (Well, a few
made us laugh). But the saddest part of all is having to say
goodbye.
There's no reason to worry though; we promise we'll be
back in the spring to further enrage you with inflammatory
editorials, columns and letters. To hold you over until then,
we're happy to present you with a the-end-is-near-oh-no-
wait-here-it-is edition of.
Darts & Laurels
Because the end really sneaks up on you.
But sometimes you can see it coming. And that's exactly
what we did when we heard about the final projects of stu-
dents at UF's Intelligent Machines Design Laboratory: self
controlled robots. "Autonomous robots" plus "Missile and
Fire Control" at Lockheed Martin equals a swift, painless
death for us all.
For possibly securing UF a spot in the history books of our
future robotic overlords, we'd like to give a maybe-they'll-
spare-us-for-creating-them LAUREL to UF's mad scientists.
Thankfully, we were recently given a reason not to mind
our coming extinction. CBS has announced that it will launch
a syndicated court show in fall 2010, featuring Nancy Grace.
That should be reason enough.
But what followed this week was yet another reminder of
why we despise Grace to no end, and why the robo-apoca-
lypse is looking more and more appealing.
A new report by a Harvard psychiatrist claims that
Grace's relentless tirade against a Florida woman three years
ago directly contributed to her suicide. The woman's son
was missing, and she was named as a possible suspect in the
disappearance before appearing for a telephone interview on
Grace's show. The idea that her all-too-common horrendous,
berating accusations would lead to a woman's suicide is no
stretch.
For allowing this trash TV to be broadcast to an even larg-
er audience, we have to throw an as-if-"CSI-Miami"-wasn't-
bad-enough DART at CBS.
But for picking up the slack left behind by the departure
of Lou Dobbs, we'd like to present a thanks-for-giving-us-
another-outlet-for-our-rage LAUREL to Nancy Grace. Bitch.
Now, since it's the last issue and everyone's too busy with
finals to read it anyway, here's something we've been dying
to try all semester:
Lightning Dart Round!
Quit-killing-the-mentally-retarded DART to Texas. Yes,
they're still up to their old tricks in Texas.
Your-renovations-suck-and-we-hate-your-show DART
to "Extreme Home Makeover."
David-vs.-Goliath-never-happened DART to Graduate
Assistants United. Surprise: You lose (but we'll root for you
anyway).
We see why this wasn't implemented earlier -too many
darts on the dance floor.
To lighten things up, we would genuinely like to thank
everyone who shared their opinions with us this semester.
We appreciate the hate mail, and we live for those elusive
love letters. Thankfully, neither were in short supply.
We miffed the mayor, slandered Student Government,
raged against RTS and cursed the city council, but our fa-
vorite part was always printing their responses (or the letters
responding for them).
We even enjoyed printing letters from those consistently
unbearable College Republicans -at least they had the guts
to stand up for the stupid, unpopular crap they believe.
The Alligator loves unpopular views -and we'll be back
in force with plenty more come Spring semester. So with fi-
nals in mind, we're proud to give a keep-working-on-those-
opinions LAUREL to.
E: All of the above.
Have a great winter break!

U F experiences hel p to prepa re for future
S unday morning, I woke up and started crying.It wasn't all about the game-which-shall-not-be-
named (Athough, don't get me wrong, football had a
lot to do with me being weepy all weekend.). It was about the
sudden reality of it all being over.
As I've repeatedly stated in this column, I graduate next
Saturday. As much as I would like to say that I'm completely
excited, I'm not.
I probably shouldn't be complaining: I have a job, I'm
staying in Florida and my entire insane family is coming to
cheer me on at commencement.
It's just so hard to say goodbye.
Intellectually, I know that all this nostalgia is stupid. I
remind myself of the many regrets I have about college. I
haven't been the perfect student or been bubbly all the time.
One semester my junior year was the worst four months of
my life. For a while, as a sophomore, I thought I had given
myself an ulcer from stress. I took math courses through cal-
culus three, only to eventually drop the major I was taking
those courses for.
It wasn't all football and parties.
So I'm not really sure why I've come down with this sud-
den case of arrested development.
I guess I don't want to have to figure everything out again,
to start from scratch.
I've spent the past four years changing everything about
myself, in my opinion for the better: I've become less type-
A, more goal-driven, more outgoing and less awkward. It
seems so unfair that just as college becomes routine, just as
I've cleared my schedule for tailgating and mid-week TV
watching, it has to end.
Everything is temporary. My uncle likes to say, "Wher-
ever you go, put up pictures, because otherwise everywhere
is just another stop on the road -nowhere ever becomes
home."I've been able to forget that at UF.
I've probably been brainwashed byfl, all of those "When did you first be-
' come a Gator?" campaigns.
In fact, I was on the phone with
my mom a couple weeks ago, and
Hilary Lehman she was talking about the newest
letters@alligatororg commercial for her alma mater, the
University of Missouri.
"It's a little like the Gator Nation one," she said, "Except
I almost think it's better because it has all these on-campus
landmarks, so it gives you a sense of place."
"But Mom," I said, exasperated, "That's the point. The
University of Florida is in Gainesville, The Gator Nation is
everywhere."
Maybe, in a desperate attempt to feel warm and fuzzy, I
will wear my Gators sweatshirt through the airport on my
next flight home and fish for "Go Gators" greetings from
strangers. Maybe I will actually donate to the money-grub-
bing alumni association, despite the fact that I can barely pay
for food.
I'll be OK. We will all be OK, seniors.
It's all over, and I'll probably burst into tears at random
moments during the next few weeks.
But I do feel that my time at UF, the friends I've made
here and even the really bad decisions behind me, have em-
powered me to live out the rest of my adult life. Sorry if that's
too sappy.
And, since this is my last column and I feel the need to
be controversial: Lady GaGa is the new Madonna, men and
women cannot be friends and people need to stop complain-
ing about stickers in Student Government elections.
Go Gators! I will miss so much about being here.

Point of Christianity is love, not judgment
I have been very upset lately by the people
supposedly "evangelizing" on Turlington Pla-
za. As I listen to them screaming judgments
and insults, it breaks my heart. I have been a
Christian for a few years now and while I still
have many questions, one thing I do know is
that the basis of Christianity is love. "For God
so loved the world." (John 3:16). "And do
everything in love." (1 Corinthians 16:14).
These people are in no way showing God's
love but are giving Christians a reputation of
being hateful and self-righteous. I am here to
say that what they are portraying is not Chris-
tianity! Whoever they claim to be witnesses
of is not Jesus because their teachings are not
rooted in love.
On behalf of them I am apologizing. Please
don't be deceived that Christians are malicious
and hateful. Don't misunderstand me, God
does hate sin because he knows the damage it
can cause in our lives, but please don't think of
this as another Christian cramming my beliefs
down your throat. Salvation through faith in a
God who loved us enough to send someone to
die to take the punishment of the world so we
don't have to, that is the point.

Supporting Gators is job of fans
It is not the Alligator's job to support the
Gators. That duty is supposed to fall upon the
fans. It seems to me that Randall Lockhart,
who wrote yesterday about the sports section
not supporting the Gators, doesn't understand
the Alligator's role in covering UF athletics.
Many students are with him in expecting thepaper's staff to be a cheerleader for UF sports.
However, the sports guys are journalists,
as they should be, and not fans. The Alliga-
tor is not a UF publication nor should it be.
They have praised the Gators many times this
season -when it's deserved. But honestly, as
disappointing as that loss was for Gators fans,
there was really nothing positive to say about
the Southeastern Conference Championship
Game from UF's perspective. The journal-
ists who cover the team are no indication of
how fans feel about the team because they are
not fans. Fans can best show their support by
showing up and cheering on Saturdays; that is
not the role of the newspaper.
Ian Fisher
3LW and former Alligator Sports editor
Gators football season not over yet
Yes, Saturday's loss in the Southeastern
Conference Championship game was heart-
breaking. And yes, Florida's dreams of an
undefeated season were once again quashed.
But we must remember that the season is not
over yet. The Gators still must represent the
SEC in a New Year's Day primetime bowl
game against the undefeated Big East cham-
pion Cincinnati Bearcats. After the University
of Alabama suffered its first loss last year to
the Gators in the conference title game, the
Crimson Tide gave up on the season and got
thrashed by a determined Utah team out of
the Mountain West Conference. We must not
allow ourselves to suffer the same fate.
We must show the best senior class in con-
ference history that The Gator Nation is be-
hind them. We must show that Gators pride is
not dependent on success, but loyalty. Because
if one loss deters you from representing your
team when the eyes of the entire nation areupon us, you are not a Gator in my book. New
Year's Eve, you'll find me on Bourbon Street.

Football loss can bring fans together
First and foremost, I am a huge supporter
of all Gators athletics, and nothing disheart-
ened me more than to see the team I root for
every Saturday of the fall semester come up
short in a high-stakes SEC Championship
game. There were no promises to be delivered
at the postgame press conference and there
are zero weeks left for us to exonerate our loss.
There will not be a new plaque to add to the
South Endzone of Ben Hill Griffin Stadium
reading "SEC Champs 2009," Tim Tebow will
not be the quarterback that wins three national
championships and no one here in Gainesville
will be heading to Pasadena, Calif., in January,
unless they are visiting family.
It's time for students, alumni and fans to
rally together, like in the old days when vic-
tories were what meant everything, not losses.
Can we be disappointed about a 12-1 season?
Sure. Can we move on? We have to.
How many Facebook statuses after Satur-
day's game read something along the lines of
"through all kinds of weather." or "it's still
great to be a Florida Gator."? Even though
Facebook statuses generally do not have much
gravity, these rallying phrases epitomize atti-
tudes all Gators need to embrace. Saturday's
loss reminds us that we cannot take a single
victory for granted, and most importantly, that
we are proud students, faculty and alumni of
something bigger than a football field, heavier
than a Heisman Trophy and shinier than a
crystal football.
We have been reminded that we are allFlorida Gators -through all kinds of weather
-and that is worth more than any trophy. As
the game clock expired Saturday, something
was reborn in The Gator Nation.

Alligator distorts meaning of Rebel flag
The editorial "Road Rebel: Confeder-
ate plate no debate for state" struck me as a
skewed and misinformed perception of what
the Confederate flag or those who wish to fly
it believe in. The fact that someone is willing
to say "those who would buy it already have
jacked-up pickups with mud tires." shows
that the only reason the confederate flag be-
ing flown is frowned upon is because of a
large generalization to which the answer can
be found in a middle school history class. The
civil war was not fought on the grounds of
"racism, bigotry and backward thought."
In fact, it was fought over a constitutional
right, that of states rights. I am a ninth gen-
eration Floridian, and while my family has
never encouraged any kind of racism or big-
otry mentioned Monday it has encouraged
me to remember my roots. This is why you
can find my confederate flag flying just below
the American flag that I pledge allegiance to
today.
So when you see my non-lifted normal
truck without mud tires sitting in a parking
lot with a confederate flag license plate on it
maybe you should think twice about what you
stand for before you condemn those who have
pride in something different than yourself.

UF library embraces lesbian-themed children's book
0 'HEATHER HAS TWO
MOMMIES' DEBUTED IN 1989.
By JULIANA JIMENEZ
Alligator Contributing Writer
"Heather's favorite number is
two. She has two eyes, two hands
and two knees. She has two pets:
her dog, Midnight, and her cat,
Gingersnap. Heather also has two
mommies: Mama Jane and Mama
Kate."
So begins "Heather Has Two
Mommies," a children's book about
a girl named Heather; her mom,
Jane, who gave birth to her after ar-
tificial insemination; and her mom's
same-sex partner, Kate.With increased mainstream ac-
ceptance of homosexuality, the
publication of similar books aimed
at an audience of children aged 3 to
6 years old, books such as " Tango
Makes Three," "The Different Drag-
on" and "Daddy's Roommate,"
have also increased.
And with the increase in popu-
larity of these books comes a deeper
divide between tolerant people
and those who aren't, said Linda
Lamme, a professor in the School of
Teaching and Learning at UF.
"Many churches preach against
homosexuality, which causes their
members to avoid gay people,"
Lamme said, "causing segregation
where it makes it virtually impos-
sible for them to become educatedon the subject."
Some academics, librarians and
teachers consider these books to be
highly beneficial despite other li-
braries' censoring of them.
"As parents, they have a right
to choose what they read and what
their children read," said Debbie
Lewis, librarian su-
Local pervisor for the Youth
News Services Depart-
ment at the Alachua
County Headquarters Library in
Gainesville. "But it's not our job to
limit access to material to children."
Some libraries have the books on
a shelf where only teachers have ac-
cess to them.
"Reading is intended to expand
children's knowledge and to getthem to think. Books about children
with gay parents should be in every
classroom because our classroom li-
braries should reflect all cultures."
Lewis said The Alachua County
Headquarters Library in Gainesville
offers several such books.
"We are a public library, and
we ascribe to the Freedom to Read
policy from the American Library
Association," Lewis said. "We serve
all members of our community, and
we live in a diverse community."
When the book came out 20 years
ago, "Heather Has Two Mommies"
was placed in the nonfiction section
of the library, where books dealing
with social issues are placed, she
said. This year, for the book's 20th
anniversary, they moved it to thepicture book section where most
of the staff thought it belonged, she
said.
The library carries between 10
and 20 picture books dealing with
homosexual characters or issues
aimed at an audience aged 3 to 5
years old, including "And Tango
Makes Three," which, according to
The American Library Association,
is the most banned book of 2009.
Lewis said in her five years at the
library it has had one or two chal-
lenges to the books every year.
"We feel it is important to have
these in the collection because there
are all kinds of families, and chil-
dren need to see their own life ex-
periences reflected in the literature
they read," Lewis said.

Alligator Contributing Writer
Many people practice environmentalism in
their daily lives. But now they can practice it
after they die, too.
The idea of going green after death is a
growing trend in the mortician industry in
Gainesville.
"Society has created a weird separation be-
tween life and death, making it something that
is handled by institutions instead of the family
coming together and bringing the body back
to the natural land," said Robert Hutchinson,
a board member of Conservation Burial Inc., a
group that provides a natural burial choice in
Gainesville. Abasic greenburial includes plac-ing the body in a biodegradable casket with-
out embalming it.
"But to take it to the next step of conserva-
tion burial, you take the sacredness of the buri-
al and use it as a way to permanently conserve
land while also protecting the environment,"
Hutchinson said.
Biodegradable caskets can include a
shroud, which wraps the body in fabric, paper
or cardboard caskets and wood caskets, a re-
newable source, he said.
Conservation Burial Inc. is not only trying
to protect the environment but is also trying
to make funerals as affordable as other forms
post-death treatments.
"Conventional burial costs between $8,000
and $10,000, and cremation costs between$2,000 and $5,000," said Susan Marynowski,
a board member of Conservation Burial Inc.
"The conservation price would be compara-
tive to the price of cremation, which is more
affordable, and the money will go into con-
serving land."
The group is also using bio-
Local degradable materials to make
News caskets.
Conventional burial includes
materials that do not decom-
pose, and regular caskets are made of import-
ed woods, toxic finishes, plastic and metals.
Conventional burial also requires a piece of
concrete called the vault, which encloses the
casket in the ground. This has the most harm-
ful impact on the environment. In fact, eachyear 1.6 million tons of concrete is used, which
could pave a highway from Tallahassee to Mi-
ami, Marynowski said.
Conservation Burial Inc. has not yet pur-
chased a site, but the site the group is look-
ing to buy is a semi-natural area that has been
logged and grazed heavily, Marynowski said.
Each time a plot is purchased, the group will
restore a piece of the site. But it will probably
take about 50 years to use all of the burial sites
and restore the entire piece of land, she said.
"We plan on purchasing the site sometime
in 2010 and turning it into a beautiful meadow
with trees and walking trails," she said.
Part of the money will go into a perpetual
land management fund to conserve the prop-
erty in the future.

Group remembers those who died in Gaza conflict
By JENNIFER BATE
Alligator Contributing Writer
There were 13 balloons float-
ing around the Plaza of the
Americas Tuesday, but nobody
was celebrating.
Each black balloon represent-
ed 100 deaths that resulted from
last winter's Gaza conflict.
The fatalities included about
1,386 Palestinian civilians, seven
Israeli soldiers and three Israeli
civilians.
"The conflict obviously in-
volved crimes against humanity,
and we wanted to commemorate
those that died in the tragedy,"
said Husam Wahdan, president
of Students for Justice in Pales-
tine.
"(The club) really strives to
increase awareness of political
and social justice awareness on
campus since there is no other
student group that does that," ac-
cording to the senior political sci-
ence major.
The student organization,
which started this semester, aims
to promote social justice and
awareness of the Israeli-Palestine
conflict, as well as human rights.The event included speak-
ers, symbolic balloons, fliers and
brownies.Addison Vawters, 21, said he Middle Eastern language and

president
"I think most people in the
United States don't see the con-
flict because it's between two
countries that we don't depend
on economically," he said.
Vawters also pointed out that
acknowledging the Israeli-Pales-
tine conflict is very important be-
cause it affects countries that we
have a vested interest in.
"I like that (the organization)
is making people aware," he said.
"It is one of the most complicated
and controversial issues today."
On Tuesday, the Student Sen-
ate heard a revised resolution
about the Gaza conflict and advo-
cating for a two-state solution.

Mechanic fixes scooters on the go
Services are available 24/7
By ERIN ROBERTS
Alligator Contributing Writer
New local business owner
Bobby Swan secures his toolbox
in the bed of his Chevrolet Colo-
rado and takes off to his ever-
changing repair shop, which
often resides in a customer's
driveway.
Swamp Life Mobile Motor-
sports Repair opened Nov. 1 and
is the first business to provide
mobile repair and maintenance
services for scooters and motor-
cycles in the Gainesville area.
"We don't have a shop; there-fore, I'm able to give substantial-
ly lower prices, and our services
are way more convenient," Swan
said. "With other repair shops,
you have to call and make an ap-
pointment then pay to have your
scooter picked up."
An air compressor, impact
drill, extra oil, cleaning supplies,
work lights and other equipment
necessary for repair are stored in
the Swamp Life truck. Services
are available 24 hours a day, and
Swamp Life also provides road-
side assistance in emergency sit-
uations.
Swan said he focuses his busi-ness on building relationships
with the customers and provid-
ing friendly services at a reason-
able rate.
"With us coming to you, the
customers are talking to us the
whole time and learning about
their vehicle," Swan said. "They
can see exactly what I'm doing.
Your vehicle never goes behind
closed doors."
Although the business is only
about a month old, Swan said
he expects to be a leading re-
pair company in Gainesville and
hopes to eventually expand it to
other universities in Florida.
"The first month of business
has been surprisingly good,"
Swan said. "We're here to stay."
People dodge balls to save lives
0 MONEY RAISED SUPPORTS CLINIC
IN TANZANIA.
By MELISSA QUINN
Alligator Contributing Writer
When Flavia, a young girl living in Tanzania,
was bitten by a rattlesnake, she had to have her leg
amputated above the knee.
Last year, five members of HOPE, a UF organiza-
tion that raises money for a medical clinic in Tanza-
nia, visited the clinic and met the young girl.
The members of HOPE spent eight weeks work-
ing at the clinic, during which Flavia received a
prosthetic leg.
HOPE raised more than $500 for her, and in the
spring the organization helped to provide her with
the new limb.
HOPE will be holding its third annual dodgeballtournament at Flavet Field Thursday to raise money
for the medical clinic in Tanzania.
The tournament will start at 11 a.m. and last un-
til about 3 p.m., said Joshua Wu, president of the
organization.
Teams may have up to seven players, and the
cost to participate is $5 per player.
Wu said the money raised will be sent to pay for
medical supplies and other equipment.
The club is partnering with AfricanOn Inland Mission to host the tournamentCampus and raise funds, he said.
About 12 teams played in the tour-
nament in 2008, and the organization is looking to
have about 16 teams register this year.
Over the past two years, HOPE has raised more
than $3,000 to send to Tanzania.
"By focusing on one clinic in one community, we
hope to see with our own eyes and touch with our
own hands those Tanzanians who our money and
time are saving," Wu said.SunRail system
to run through
Central Florida
By MATT HARRINGER
Alligator ContributingWriter
The Florida Senate passed legislation Tuesday to create
SunRail, a $1.2 billion commuter-rail system in Central Flor-
ida.
Ending a special session that began Thursday, the Senate
passed the bill 27-10 less than 24 hours after the House voted
84-25 in support of the legislation. The project failed twice be-
fore.
The commuter rail will run from Deland through Orlando
and south to Poinciana. However, there will be no SunRail sta-
tions at Orlando International Airport, Disney or Universal.
The legislation included additional fund-
ing for the struggling South Florida commut-
er rail, TriRail, and makes the state eligible
for more than $2 billion in federal funding
for a high-speed rail project to connect Or-
lando, Miami, Tampa and Jacksonville.
Legislators representing Gainesville
were split on the rail project. Speaker Larry
Crist Cretul, whose district includes UT, voted for
the bill, and in a press release said, the proj-
ect will benefit residents and visitors throughout Florida.
However, Gainesville's other representatives, Rep. Charles
"Chuck" Chestnut IV and Sen. Steve Oelrich, who represent
all of Alachua County, voted against the legislation.
Oelrich said in a press release that he could not support the
bill at a time when the legislature was forced to cut education
and health care spending.
The SunRail project will become law with the signature of
Gov. Charlie Crist, who has been a strong supporter of the leg-
islation.

Help site answers UF students' questions via blog
Bloggers post
By CAROLYN TILLO
Alligator Writer
Students who like it fast and
easy now have a Web site de-
signed just for them.
UFHelp.com, a site launched
in October, allows UF students to
submit questions about anything
from coursework to clubs with a
few quick clicks.
The site is a project sponsored
by Gators of Tomorrow, an or-ganization that chooses 25 fresh-
men each year based on their aca-
demic excellence and leadership
abilities.
David Yakobovitch, sopho-
more finance major and one of
the site's founders, said students
can submit questions by clicking
the "Contact" link on the site or
by e-mailing help@ufhelp.com.
He said the site has a team
of about 30 bloggers who an-
swer each question and posts aresponse on the site within 48
hours.
Yakobovitch said the bloggers
provide their own unique stu-
dent perspectives on the issues
addressed.
On About 100 sets
Campus of questions and
answers have been
posted so far, including tips
about registering for season foot-
ball tickets, taking a class on a
pass/fail basis and figuring outresponses within 48 hoursLiberal Arts and Sciences, who
may struggle to meet with advis-
ers.
Husam Wahdan, a senior po-
litical science major and one of
the site's bloggers, said he wishes
the site was available when he
was a freshman.
Navigating through the UF
Web site to find resources for get-
ting involved on campus proved
difficult, he said.
"The way I look at it, it's like a
freshman survival guide," Wah-
dan said.

Horticultural club offers holiday poinsettia variety
0 THE COST OF PLANTS
RANGES FROM $9 TO $28.
By ALISON SCHWARTZ
Alligator Writer
'Tis the season to be jolly -and
decorate accordingly.
UF's Environmental Horticul-
ture Club is holding its annual
Poinsettia Show and Sale Dec. 10
at the Fifield Hall greenhouses on
Hull Road.
Kara Monroe, the club's presi-
dent, said those looking to get
their annual fix of holiday cheerwill find more than the traditional
array of poinsettias.
"You can go to Wal-Mart and
buy a kind of junky poinsettia for
$3, but you get the real deal when
you come out here," the UF en-
vironmental horticulture senior
said.
The club will be selling more
than 30 varieties of poinsettias
from global plant breeders, rang-
ing from $9 to $28.
Monroe said the plants are
priced according to size and rarity
of the poinsettia strain.
The club has raised about 2,500
poinsettias since August, cultivat-"You can go to Wal-Mart
and buy a kind of junky
poinsettia for $3, but you
get the real deal when you
come out here."

UF senior
ing the plants from seedlings.
From deep orange to white
speckles, Monroe said there's more
to poinsettias than the traditional
crimson hue.
"Sometimes you just think of
the boring red, but there are somany different kinds to see," she
said. "It gets you out of that box."
Her personal favorite is the
Winter Rose, a variety of poinsettia
where the leaves are red and tight-
ly curved in a rose-like curvature.
The poinsettias will also be on
display in a neighboring green-
house at the event, and potential
shoppers can participate in a con-
sumer analysis study for a compli-
mentary poinsettia.
The sale will happen rain or
shine, and after the poor weather
at last year's sale, Monroe is hop-
ing for the latter.
Despite the rain, the club madeabout $15,000 at last year's sale.
"That's the nature of working
outside all the time," she said. "We
make do."
And it's this enthusiasm that
carries the sale each year as the
club's largest fundraiser.
"The best part of the experience
is to see the interest in the sale,"
Monroe said. "It's exciting to see
this work that you've done begin-
ning in August start to come full
circle."
The sale lasts from 8 a.m. to 4
p.m. There is a clearance sale Dec.
11 from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. at the
same location.

UF faces Syracuse in top-10 matchup
0 THE TEAMS WILL SQUARE OFF IN TAMPA ON
THURSDAY.
By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
aberry@alligator org
It's the top-10 showdown nobody saw coming.
Florida and Syracuse began their seasons unranked and
with unclear expectations, both seemingly somewhere in
the rebuilding process. But each has reeled off huge non-
conference wins and worked its way into the top 10 just four
weeks into the season.
The two surprise successes will meet Thursday in Tam-
pa, as the No. 10 Gators (8-0) will take on the No. 7 Orange
(8-0) as part of the Southeastern Conference-Big East Invita-
tional in the St. Pete Times Forum.
"We definitely know we're not the greatest team in the
world, and we even feel like we haven't even come close
to playing our best ball," sophomore point guard Erving
Walker said. "It would be foolish to think like that, especial-
ly playing a team like Syracuse who has done just as much
as us right now, if not more."
Syracuse edged out Florida 89-83 last season in Kansas
City, Mo., but both squads are vastly different than the ones
that met over a year ago. UF is without guards Nick Cal-
athes, who scored 19 points and added seven assists against
the Orange in 2008, and Walter Hodge, while Syracuse lost
starters Jonny Flynn, Paul Harris and Eric Devendorf.
The Gators have since added guard Kenny Boynton and
transfer center Vernon Macklin to help ease their losses,
and the Orange brought in a transfer of their own to fill the
void in junior forward WesleyJohnson, who is averaging 17
points, 7.3 rebounds and 2.6 assists per game for Syracuse
after spending two years at Iowa State.
UF coach Billy Donovan said Johnson's talent and versa-
tility will present a unique challenge to forwards Dan Wer-
ner and Chandler Parsons, who will likely match up with
Johnson on defense.
"He's a terrific player, but the one thing that's been good

UF point guard Erving Walker had 13 points and five rebounds off the
bench during Florida's 89-83 loss to Syracuse last year.
Meyer faces challenge in making bowl seem sweet
My biggest knock on Pete Carrollover the years has been his in-
ability to get his team mentally
prepared for playing lower-quality teams
throughout an entire season.
It seems every year USC is a favorite
to win the national title and every year it
loses to a team it shouldn't, and I blame the
coach for not having his players ready to
go in a game it should win easily.
It's easy to get your team ready for ri-
valry games and other big-time matchups,
but making sure your team doesn't get
caught looking ahead in a trap game takes
great leadership from the coaches.
Urban Meyer has been able to keep his
team from suffering too many letdownsover the years. Only
the loss to Missis-
sippi last season was
a game that Florida
shouldn't have lost.

This season, Florida's unprec-
edented 18-year streak of confer-
ence dominance was snapped. On
Friday, it will try to return the fa-
vor and end another team's historic
run.
Penn State has won 98 consecu-
tive matches and is in position to
become the first women's volleyball
team to win three straight national
championships.
But the No. 14 Gators (25-5) can
end all of that Friday as they take
on the No. 1 Nittany Lions (34-0) in
the third round of the NCAA tour-
nament at 6 p.m. in the O'Connell
Center. No. 10 California (20-10)
will square off with
Baylor (24-9) at 3:30
p.m. to kick off the
Gainesville Region-Volleyball al.
"There are many
who think that this
[Penn State] is the best women's
volleyball team of all time, and
that's who we get to play Friday
night," coach Mary Wise said.
Penn State has not lost a match
since September 2007 and has only
dropped five sets all season.
It features senior opposite hit-
ter Megan Hodge, who averages
4.7 kills per set, and six players
who own a hitting efficiency higher
than .350. The only UF players who
boasts such a percentage are soph-
omores Cassandra Anderson (.360)
and Kelly Murphy (.351).
"The core of Penn State is the
future of our Olympic team," Wise
said.
While watching tape of the Nit-
tany Lions, Wise has had a hard
time finding holes.

Florida hopes to snap out of slump aga
By EUGENIO TORRENS
Alligator Staff Writer
etorrens@alligator org
Harrison Diamond / Alligator Staff
UF guard Steffi Sorensen is the team's third-leading scorer at 7.8 points per game but has struggled to
find her shot behind the 3-point arc, connecting on only 27.4 percent of her attempts.Eight games into the season, Flor-
ida isn't where it would like to be.
The Gators (3-5) have dropped
consecutive games for the second
time this season and have yet to win
back-to-back games.
"Has it been a rough start? Yes,"
senior guard Steffi Sorensen said.
She attributed part of the bumpy
start to a tough schedule that includ-
ed then-No. 13 FSU and a Pittsburgh
team that is now ranked No. 15, as
well as playing a Rutgers team in
Piscataway, N.J., on ESPN2.
Sorensen is hoping the experi-
ence from those games -all losses
-pays dividends in future games
and makes the team more composed
in tightly contested ball games.
For a team that was expected
to shoot the lights out this season,
so far the squad has been shooting
blanks.
"We haven't shot the ball well all
year," coach Amanda Butler said.
In Monday night's game against
Rutgers, Florida was the victim of
poor shooting due to an ineffec-
live post game early on as well asinst ODU
the 1-3-1 zone defense the Scarlet
Knights applied against the Gators
that forced pressure, pushing UF
farther away from the 3-point line
and forcing the team to float around
the perimeter.
The second half of that game saw
UF play more to its up-tempo style.
The Gators did shoot marginally
better in the second half and out-
scored Rutgers 24-23 after intermis-
sion.
"There's definitely a sense of ur-
gency," senior guard Susan Yenser
said. "I don't see our team spiraling
or even showing signs of spiraling,
but this is the time where we have to
keep it from spiraling out of control
because our schedule doesn't get
any easier."
With UF set to start Southeast-
ern Conference play Jan. 3, the team
has winter break to find its shooting
stroke beginning with a trip to Old
Dominion on Friday.
"It's not like we're a bad team,"
Yenser said. "We're a good team
playing bad.
"At some point in time during
the season, we're going to be the
team that we're supposed to be, be-
cause right now we're not."
Loss makes Tebow human
O ne of my TV-watching habitss rather quirky.
See, I'm a huge fan of ES-
PN's "Pardon the Interruption."
But with the schedule I've kept
this semester, PTI hasn't always fit
into my daily schedule.
So I catch up on my DVR when-
ever possible. It's weird to hear pre-
views of events that already hap-
pened, but it's also quite fascinating
to see how some things were pre-
dicted. On Tuesday, I got a chance to
watch Friday's episode, including a
segment previewing the SEC Cham-
pionship Game.
Unsurprisingly, much of Tony
Kornheiser's reasoning for picking
Florida to win had to do with Tim
Tebow at the helm. One particular
quote stuck out to me.
"I love the fact that every time
they have to win, they win," Korn-
heiser said. "And they have to win
this one."
I had a similar sentiment before
the game. Whenever I sat down to
decide who had the matchup advan-
tage, Tebow kept coming to mind.
The guy just didn't lose.
I feel like I've written that sen-
tence a hundred times -and felt
corny doing it every time -but it's
remarkable how much that legacy
seems a little lessened today.
Florida won 22 straight games
before being taken out behind the
woodshed by Alabama. Before then,
it seemed like no matter what hap-
pened, Tebow would will the Gators
to victory.
The very idea of that sounds ab-
surd, of course, since Tebow plays
one of 11 offensive positions, never
lines up on defense, and I haven't
seen him run back kicks or take field
goals yet.
But in a way, Saturday's loss
made Tebow seem even more im-
pressive to me.
Sure, he'd walked off the field in
defeat before -but never on a stagePhil Kegler
Phil on the Hill
p kegler@a lIigato r orglike the SEC
Champion-
ship Game
on Saturday.
T e a r s
f l o w e d ,
and anyone
who has
ever wanted
something
so bad knew
exactly how Tebow felt at that mo-
ment. Everything he worked toward
for a year was lost in a single night.
But I came away with an even
greater respect for him, because he
didn't make history.
Think about it -if Florida had
won another national title, Tebow
would've left Gainesville a winner
in 24 straight games. He would've
uttered The Promise after the Ole
Miss loss, ran off a perfect record
and then waved goodbye at his third
national title celebration ceremony
in four years.
That isn't real -it's fantasy. It's
Hollywood. It's perfect.
He would've been remembered
as a mythical figure -and right-
fully so -but who can really asso-
ciate themselves with someone who
doesn't fail?
Saturday's loss made Tebow 100
percent human. It made him real.
The best player in Florida football
history failed in a way, and it made
me appreciate him more.
His defense gave him no sup-
port. His coaching staff didn't give
him much help. His running backs
never got the chance to lend him
a hand. But Tebow, in his typical
fierce competitor style, will likely
only remember that he didn't get it
done on a national stage.
And that failure should make
everyone realize just how great his
other successes were.
Even if it took a four-day-old PTI
broadcast to make that obvious to
me.Syracuse mixes man, zone defenses

Donovan said. "Dan has played
post defense throughout his ca-
reer here. Now, being more of a
small forward, he's had the op-
portunity to play a lot of guys

"Dan's gonna need help
from the rest of the guys on our
team, but he's a guy that can do
it in a lot of different ways."

UF-Penn St. matchup boasts NCAA Tournament's top two hitting teams
VOLLEY, from page 21
said. "We are looking for
cracks, but there are none to
be had."
Senior libero Elyse Cu-
sack believes too many errors
could spell the end for the
Gators.
So far, that has not been a
problem for them.
UF has a tournament-best
hitting efficiency of .424 in
the first two rounds, while
Penn State sits with the sec-
ond-highest percentage.
"We know that we aren't
going to be able to make the
little errors we got away with
earlier in the season," Cusack
said. "Playing a great team
like Penn State, you can't
make unforced errors like
that."
The surface the teams play
on will be different than the
hardwood the O'Connell Cen-
ter usually features. NCAA
rules force all of the sites to
put down a sport court sur-face for any match beyond
the second round.
"You can slide better on
it," Cusack said. "I like it
for defense because you can
dive, and you don't stick and
you don't get the court burns
that I usually get on the hard-
wood."
The thin layer of extra
cushion it provides should
work in Cu-
sack's benefit
. as she looks
to become the
Volleyball Southeastern
Conference's
all-time digs
leader.
She is just four away from
breaking the record.
With the record in reach,
the tougher task will be to get
past Penn State.
"This women's volleyball
team of Penn State is UCLA
when they had Lew Alcindor,
and you know what? No one
got UCLA during that stretch
-so it's quite the challenge,"
Wise said.UF libero Elyse Cusack knows her team must limit its unforced errors if the Gators want to knock off the top-
ranked Nittany Lions on Friday. Penn State has lost just five sets all year.
BOBBY, from page 21
to prove. It is in a BCS conference and still
did not get any consideration for the BCS
title game despite finishing undefeated like
Texas and Alabama.
A win over the Gators would strengthen
the Bearcats' argument that they should
have played for the national title.Florida will likely have to do most of its
gameplanning for Brian Kelly's high-scoring
offense without defensive coordinator Char-
lie Strong, who will likely be preparing to
take over as Louisville's head coach, which
will require him to be on the road recruit-
ing.
Strong has been the leading force in mo-
tivating one of the nation's best defenses all
season, with his unit's one hiccup coming inthe biggest game of the year.
His replacement is likely to be a combi-
nation of Dan McCarney and Chuck Heater.
Both are excellent coaches, but it is hard to
tell how either will do in getting the defens-
es to rebound after the embarrassing perfor-
mance against the Crimson Tide.
Let's face it -none of the players want
to be playing in the Sugar Bowl when they
could have been attempting to establishthemselves as the greatest team in college
football history.
Obviously they are going to want to win
the game, but how badly is the question.
Meyer's job is not just going to be fixing
the flaws that cost his team the SEC Cham-
pionship but also getting his team hyped up
for a game no one really wants to play, and
that might be one of the toughest challenges
of his career.
24, ALLIGATOR U WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 9,2009
End of NCAA football season not end of the world with basketball underway
F orida still has a Sugar Bowl to play, butthe mood around Gainesville is college
football season is pretty much over.
It was fun while it lasted, but now we can
immerse ourselves in my favorite sport: col-
lege basketball.
With UF off to a surprisingly good start and
a top-10 ranking, it's time we turned our atten-
tion to roundball, especially with a matchup
with Syracuse just around the corner.
I know football is the king of college ath-
letics, but here's the top-10 reasons why I love
college basketball:
10. EARLY SEASON TOURNAMENTS: Most
of them are over by now, but the only rea-
son we get to watch Florida and Syracuse go
head-to-head is because of the SEC-Big East
Invitational. The tournaments give us tons
of great nonconference matchups, and a win
in the Maui Invitational (Gonzaga), Coaches
vs. Cancer Classic (Syracuse) or NIT Season
Tip-Off (Duke) can propel your team into
conference play with confidence and provide
the marquee victories needed to get into the
NCAA Tournament in March.
9. THE BIG EAST: Conferences get the word
"Big" in their name for no good reason these
days, but the Big East is exactly that. It's the
SEC of college basketball -if the SEC had
16 teams instead of 12. Sure, there are a few
bottom feeders (Rutgers, USF, DePaul, Seton
Hall), but what conference doesn't have a fewbad teams? ESPN shows plenty of the action
each year on Big Monday, and the Big East
Tournament always provides classics like last
season's Syracuse-UConn six-OT title game.
8. "ONE SHINING MOMENT": Don't worry,
March Madness gets its own paragraph, but
"One Shining Moment" is cool enough to be
a separate thought of its own. Watching the
montage at the end of every NCAA Tourna-
ment while the new champion celebrates on
the court in its corny locker room victory gear
is a must for anyone who loves college sports.
It shows the ups and downs of the six-round
tournament and puts all the memorable mo-
ments to an even more memorable tune. One
of my guy friends cries every time he watches
that year's edition for the first time, and none
of us make fun of him. That's how cool "One
Shining Moment" is.
7. COACHING ACTUALLY MATTERS: For the
most part, coaching matters more in college
sports than pro sports, but that dichotomy
is most obvious when comparing the NBA
to college basketball. NBA coaches do pretty
much nothing. They stand on the sideline, yell
at the refs, draw up plays during timeouts and
try not to mess things up. With the NCAA's
35-second clock, compared to the NBA's
24-second clock, it allows for more strategy
on both ends of the floor and therefore more
coaching. Zone defenses are more prevalent,
and college kids are still exactly that -kids.U
Kyle Maistri
Kyle Points
kmaistri@alligator orgMost of them want to
be coached.
6. MID-MAJORS:
Small conference foot-
ball schools exist only to
get pounded on by big
college football schools.
In basketball, the small
schools occasionally do
the pounding, and it's
fun to watch. The Cin-
derella potential for a team like George Mason
is something you can't get anywhere else.
5. MID-MAJORS THAT AREN'T MID-MAJORS:
Gonzaga, Butler and Xavier all play in mid-
major conferences, but none of them are really
mid-major schools. Somehow, they have been
able to establish themselves as annual powers
in a system where big schools have every ad-
vantage when it comes to recruiting. It could
be compared to Boise State and TCU in foot-
ball if Boise State and TCU were actually al-
lowed to, you know, COMPETE AGAINST
THE BIG SCHOOLS at the end of the year.
4. DICKIE V: Dick Vitale is a legend, and
anyone who says otherwise is a Satan-wor-
shipping bastard. His voice is as identifiable as
his many catchphrases, and his enthusiasm for
the game is a breath of fresh air considering the
increasingly corporate nature of college sports.
Quite simply put, Dickie V is awesome, baby!
(All right, maybe he's a little corny, too.)3. WHITE GUYS: Basketball has become "the
black man's game," and that's perfectly fine
with me. The best athletes in the world play in
the NBA, which is more than 80 percent black,
and that's my favorite league of all, college or
professional. But as a white kid whose game is
reliant on deft passing and outside shooting,
I like to watch some guys who look and play
like me every once in a while, and college bas-
ketball provides that. I like watching guys like
J.J. Redick, Lee Humphrey and Stephen Curry
-wait, he was black?! -even if those same
guys go on to sit at the end of an NBA bench
and get dunked on by LeBron, Kobe and D-
Wade at the next level.
2. DUKE VS. UNC: I hate North Carolina.
I hate Duke more. But man, I really love the
Duke-UNC basketball rivalry. For my money,
it's the best rivalry in all of sports, and it's No.
1 on the list of nonchampionship sporting
events I want to attend in my lifetime.
1. MARCH MADNESS: The NCAA Tourna-
ment is the exact opposite of the BCS system.
It is quite possibly the most perfect and en-
tertaining postseason of any sport out there.
Nothing is better than skipping class for a cou-
ple days while you glue yourself to the couch
and watch the first weekend, which somehow
always lives up to the hype. And most impor-
tantly, the last team standing earned its cham-
pionship -something we're not always able
to say about college football.
Smile.
