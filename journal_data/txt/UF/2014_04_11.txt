The presidential search is on — again.
UF’s Board of Trustees approved the creation of a pres-
idential search committee Thursday to ﬁ  nd a replacement for President Bernie Machen, whose contract ends Dec. 31.
This is the second time the committee has been formed 
to ﬁ  nd a successor for Machen, who was slated to step down in 2013 once a replacement was chosen. 
The committee was close to interviewing ﬁ  nalists when 
the search was called off, and Machen’s contract was ex-tended. Gov. Rick Scott requested Machen remain at UF to lead its quest for a spot in the nation’s top 10 public universities.
The new committee, chaired by trustee Steve M. Scott, 
will begin the hunt for candidates in the coming months. Committee members have yet to be named by Board of Trustees chairman David Brown.
Scott said the search will involve the Board of Trust-
ees members as well as the university’s roughly 240,000 stakeholders. 
“I’m honored and pleased to take on this responsibil-
ity,” he said.
In a statement emailed to UF alumni, students, faculty 
and supporters, Brown announced the committee’s cre-ation and asked for the community’s input on reusing the search criteria from 2012’s endeavor. The 24 qualiﬁ  cations, which were primarily made from desirable traits given by Post-Machen

Paging all book lovers: The 
Friends of the Library Book Sale is 
this weekend.
More than 700,000 items — in-
cluding books, CDs and artwork — will ﬁ  ll the Friends of the Library Bookhouse, located at 430 N. Main St.
“It’s gonna be an absolute hoot,” 
said Sue Dudley, volunteer publicity chair of the book sale.
The sale will kick off Saturday at 9 
a.m. with a Scottish bagpiper playing outside the bookhouse, Dudley said. It will last until 6 p.m. that day, then reopen from 1 to 6 p.m. Sunday, noon to 7 p.m. Monday and Tuesday, and noon to 6 p.m. Wednesday. 
On Tuesday, the merchandise is 
half-price, and everything is 10 cents on Wednesday, she said.
The sale features a Collector’s Cor-
ner with rare and ﬁ  rst-edition books. Dudley said this year’s corner will feature an edition of Shakespeare’s Hamlet with pages in English and Klingon, a ﬁ  ctional language spoken in Star Trek, among other items.
UF English and history junior 
Kathleen O’Leary, 20, said she’s planning to scope out the sale. 
O’Leary, also a UF Library Am-
bassador, said if she ﬁ  nds something Saturday she can’t live without, she’ll buy it then. But she plans to go back for other purchases on 10-cent day.
“You’ve got to do multiple 
rounds,” she said. Massive book sale starts downtown

A ﬂ  aw in a widely used online security 
mechanism has left information technology 
departments doing damage control, but ofﬁ  -cials at UF said students’ information is safe.
The bug, nicknamed “Heartbleed,” re-vealed that OpenSSL, which is responsible for the security of sensitive information over on-line channels, has ﬂ  awed coding that exposes weaknesses that make passwords and other information vulnerable. 
But Avi Baumstein, a senior information se-
curity analyst at UF, said students don’t need to change passwords to university-related ac-counts.
“We have no reason to believe that any 
passwords have been compromised,” he said.
Shibboleth, the system behind the sign-on process for high-use university resources such as Webmail, e-Learning and ISIS, remains un-affected, Baumstein said.
Baumstein said students who believe their 
passwords have been compromised should change their passwords immediately and con-tact the UF Computing Helpdesk.
“The best practice is to use different pass-
words for each service, so that if criminals ob-tain passwords from one, they still won’t have access to your other accounts,” he said.
Dominique Overstreet, a web developer for the Gator Gaming club, said the club’s website runs on custom code that doesn’t use OpenSSL. As a result, it is free of security is-sues, the 22-year-old UF computer engineer-ing senior said. 
“I will do research on the ‘Heartbleed’ bug 
to make sure that it is not a problem for our website in the future,” he said.
Mashable.com reported that passwords 
should be changed for popular social media sites, including Facebook, Intagram, Tumblr and Pinterest.

April 12 means one small step 
for man and one giant party for 
mankind. 
Yuri’s Night: the World Space 
Party is an international celebra-tion of man’s exploration of the ﬁ  nal frontier, and it’s coming to Gainesville this weekend. UF’s Small Satellite Design Club is hosting the free party at 9 p.m. on Saturday at The Midnight down-town.
April 12 commemorates Rus-
sian cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, the ﬁ  rst human to enter space in 1961, as well as the 1981 launch of the Columbia, NASA’s ﬁ  rst space shuttle. The United Na-tions’ Space Generation Advisory Council Conference started the tradition in 2001 with 64 events worldwide. This year, Gainesville will join people around the world for the celebration. 
Tyler Strickland, external vice 
president of the Small Satellite Design Club, said the party will be a laid-back social event. 
The Midnight will have $2 spe-
cials on Blue Moon and the club hired a disc jockey to play space-themed music. It will decorate the scene accordingly.
“We’re usually an engineering-
focused club, but we wanted to do something that everyone can ap-preciate,” the 22-year-old UF aero-space engineering senior said. 
Peter Barnes, a UF assistant sci-
entist and professor of astronomy, said while launching research ro-bots and probes to space is more efﬁ  cient, sending humans into space is an accomplishment for prestige.
“It’s a frontier,” Barnes said. 
“It’s a cultural thing.”

Here’s a Snapchat story: College students 
love taking selﬁ  es, and universities are using 
the new social media to recruit them.
Tennessee Wesleyan College and the Uni-
versity of Michigan have started using Snap-chat, an app that allows users to take a picture or video to send to friends, as a social media platform to recruit and keep in touch with stu-dents.
Bruce Floyd, social media specialist for uni-
versity relations, said that there isn’t a plan at this time for UF to use Snapchat.
“We’re focused on optimizing accounts that 
we already have,” Floyd said. “It takes time to review and execute for better platforms.”
UF’s Twitter proﬁ  le has 66,000 follow-
ers,  and UF’s Facebook proﬁ  le has more than 544,000 likes, with the numbers growing dai-ly.
The best way to use social media as a plat-
form, Floyd said, is to present content that encourages people to like and share informa-tion.
“Our goal is to align our wants and needs 
with our fan base,” Floyd said.
Traditional recruiting tactics, such as bill-
boards, mailers and print advertisements, are more likely to connect with parents, Cleve-land.com reported.
Alexandra Giordano, a 20-year-old UF 
anthropology sophomore, said she isn’t sure how Snapchat would function with so many people having access to the application.
“It’s such a short-term thing. The picture 
disappears after 10 seconds, and then it’s gone,”  Giordano said. “I’d rather look at Fa-cebook because if I forget, I can look up infor-mation.”FRIDAY, APRIL 11, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 3

Students will be taking games 
seriously with a video-game tourna-
ment Saturday in the Reitz Union. 
The Gator Gaming club is spon-
soring GatorLAN at noon Saturday in the Grand Ballroom. The event’s 12-hour lineup will feature 10 games, including new offerings such as “Hearthstone” alongside old favor-ites like “Halo 3.”
Competitors will link their com-
puters and consoles together to com-pete.
“The competition will be high for 
most games,” said Gator Gaming president Ed Fonseca, a 22-year-old UF digital arts and sciences senior. “We have people from all over Flori-da come to showcase their skills.”
Bijan Sánchez, a 20-year-old UF 
aerospace engineering freshman, at-tended the previous GatorLAN event in January.
He said GatorLAN was much bet-
ter than other video game events he’s attended.
“There was so much to do,” he 
said. “I never got bored.”
Josh Campbell, a 21-year-old 
computer science student, competed in the tournament’s “League of Leg-ends” competition in January. 
Campbell said even though the 
tournament was competitive, “ev-eryone was having a good time, and it was a generally positive atmo-sphere.”
Fonseca said the club continues to 
organize GatorLAN because it enjoys the community’s camaraderie.
“We love eSports and want to see 
the scene grow,” he said.Gator gamers get gaming

UF’s community, include traits like administrative 
experience, a background in academics and ﬁ  scal leadership.
“Bernie Machen has been a transformational 
leader,” Brown wrote. “When we asked him to extend his service to UF, he answered the call to work with the state’s educational and political leaders to obtain ofﬁ  cial status and new resources for preeminence. We will build on this foundation as we seek to become a top-10 public AAU research university.”
The previous committee ran into issues when 
some candidates were intimidated by Florida’s Sunshine Law, which makes public institution’s information public, including things like presiden-tial applications. A bill in Florida’s House of Rep-resentatives, HB 115, sought to 
protect the names of candidates until ﬁ  nalists were announced, but whether it will survive the legislative process by the time this presidential search gets un-derway is unknown.
UF put up an accompanying 
website for the search, which 
includes a rough timeline and details about the presidency. 
The timeline has the creation of several subcom-
mittees for the search to take place over the remain-der of Spring 2014, with solicitation of nominations and applications for the presidency to begin at Summer 2014 at the latest. The Board of Trustees will select the 12th president, with ratiﬁ  cation by the Board of Governors by Spring 2015.

Different species of butterﬂ  ies are found 
all over the world, but at the Butterﬂ  y Rain-
forest in the Florida Museum of Natural His-tory on UF’s campus, they all come together.
The Butterﬂ  y Rainforest has called the 
museum home for the past 10 years, and until May 14, it will feature a special section called Butterﬂ  y Life Cycles.
Ingrith Martinez, a Butterﬂ  y Rainforest 
production assistant and lab technician, said the program aims to educate people about the life cycles of butterﬂ  ies and moths.
“We want to make sure that everybody 
realizes that butterﬂ  ies aren’t just butter-ﬂ  ies,” Martinez said. “They come in fabulous caterpillars, and the pupae can be gorgeous –— some of them look like they’re dipped in molten gold.”
Museum visitors are encouraged to watch 
butterﬂ  ies emerge from chrysalises that have been shipped to the museum from around the world, she said.
Lori Gage, a Butterﬂ  y Rainforest specialist, 
said butterﬂ  ies have four stages of develop-ment, but the exhibit only features the insects in their last two life stages  — the pupa and then the adult.
Meagan King, a 22-year-old UF public re-
lations senior, said she enjoys visiting the But-terﬂ  y Rainforest.
“I love it,” King said. “It’s a really cool 
thing to have so close to campus and a great thing to do with parents or siblings in the af-ternoon.”FRIDAY, APRIL 11, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 5

The City of Gainesville opened 
its Community Grant Program ap-
plications Friday, and nonproﬁ  t student clubs are eligible to apply. 
The program, which organiza-
tions can apply for until April 23, will give grants of up to $3,000 to local nonproﬁ  ts that provide ser-vices to needy individuals and families in the community.  
City of Gainesville spokesman 
Bob Woods said the city has rec-ommended $125,000 be provided to fund the community grant pro-gram through the city’s budget.
Woods said if previous num-
bers hold true, the city expects about 50 nonproﬁ  ts to apply for this grant program.John Wachtel, neighborhood-
planning coordinator for the city, said student organizations can ap-ply to the grant as long as they’re in the city limits of Gainesville.
“We’re trying to aid as many 
programs as we can through this funding mechanism,” Wachtel said.
UF business management ju-
nior Quinn Middleton, 21, said her organization is planning to apply for the grant.
“We can’t grow without more 
resources,” said Middleton, co-founder of The Servant’s House Ministries at UF. “We’re really get-ting limited by what we have and what we need.”
The Servant’s House Ministries 
is a faith-based nonproﬁ  t with a mission to empower and equip university students to use their passions and talents to serve God and the community.
“This one (grant) would help 
us tremendously,” she said. “We could expand our whole infra-structure and operations.”

As part of a presidential proclamation on Monday for 
National Equal Pay Day, President Barack Obama said, “On 
National Equal Pay Day, we mark how far into the new year women would have to work to earn the same as men did in the previous year, and we recommit to making equal pay a reality.”
You best recommit, Obama. In Florida, the wage gap is in-
sane: Women are paid on average $0.84 to every dollar a man makes — and that’s just white women. Black women take home just $0.62 for every dollar a non-Hispanic white man makes, and Latina women make just $0.58 on the dollar. This week, we’re throwing a DART to Florida’s wage-gap prob-
lem. It’s 2014, y’all; we have 3-D printing and Hot Pockets. Equal pay for men and women is the next logical step.

Hey, you know what goes really well with riots and natural 
disasters where people tend to act erratically and irrationally? Guns. More speciﬁ  cally, people without concealed-carry li-censes carrying guns. At least, that’s what went through the National Riﬂ  e Association’s collective mind this week when it introduced a bill into the Florida House that would allow non-permit-carrying ﬁ  rearm owners to carry guns on their person during emergencies, according to the Miami Herald. 
“To allow people to go into a riot while concealing a gun 
without a permit is the deﬁ  nition of insanity,” Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri told the Herald. “The bill is crazy. It’s absurd.”
Um, yeah. We’re throwing a sit-the-eff-down-NRA DART  
to HB 209, and we’re calling on Florida House members to 
slap that noise down.

Stay golden, UF. HBO GO: Streaming is an afterthought
On Sunday night, season four of “Game of Thrones” premiered, and it broke the Internet. 
“Two Swords” broke all sorts of records, too. 
Two million more people watched this episode than last season’s premiere, and it was HBO’s most-viewed pro-gram since Tony Soprano mysteriously faded into dark-ness back in 2007. It also almost instantly became one of the most pirated TV episodes of all time. 
“Game of Thrones” can best be described as a political 
thriller set in a classic medieval fantasy land, where rival factions cut deals with and murder each other in really dramatic ways. 
Personally, I’ve only seen the ﬁ  rst two episodes —  
enough for me to seethe with rage at the fact that Seth MacFarlane dated the actress who plays Daenerys Tar-garyen, even if I can’t be considered a true fan. 
The show’s fans simultaneously take it super seri-
ously and not seriously at all. Freaky online pleas for “Game of Thrones” role-playing atop a replica of the Iron Throne coexist alongside clips of the show dubbed over with “Seinfeld”-style bass lines and laugh tracks. It has spouted dozens of memes, and by mere virtue of being alive, I’m aware that there is a thing called the Red Wedding, which I hear is absolutely horrifying. 
With so much anticipation and fandom, one would 
have expected HBO to have braced itself in the days lead-ing up to “Two Swords.” Sadly — and to the exaspera-tion of many — HBO GO, the channel’s streaming site, crashed during the premiere due to the gross overload of viewers, which was a total ﬁ  asco. 
The same thing happened during the season ﬁ  nale of 
“True Detective” last month. 
During an attempt at research, I was utterly dismayed 
to ﬁ  nd that you can only subscribe to HBO GO if you already have an active HBO subscription on cable. There is no middle ground. 
So how come all the people who crashed the site didn’t just watch it on TV, if they presumably had it on there anyway? 
The explanation is that HBO 
account holders share their in-formation with friends and fam-ily members and loved ones, leading to more people watch-ing the show than there are ac-
tual HBO subscribers. This doesn’t bother HBO all that much because they still get bangin’ ratings while keep-ing all those other folks from turning to piracy, which literally millions of people do already. 
So why doesn’t HBO just evolve, let the chips fall 
where they may and allow people to sign up for HBO GO accounts without having to go through a cable network? 
The problem is that HBO, the cable companies and the 
average citizens are in a kind of ﬁ  nancial Mexican stand-off, and HBO GO is the thing they’re about to ﬁ  ght over. 
The cable companies know that the days are num-
bered for their current business model. What Netﬂ  ix de-livery did to video rental stores, Netﬂ  ix streaming and sites like it are doing to cable companies. HBO still does the majority of its business through cable. Streaming is, for the time being, an afterthought. Right now, HBO and the cable companies need each other: HBO needs cable to distribute its programming, and cable companies need HBO’s exclusive programming to keep customers from ditching them. 
But with the way media is going, this game won’t be 
kept up for long. The inevitable is being delayed. Cable as we know it will be dead sooner rather than later.  HBO, then, should give in and let me get an HBO GO account so I can catch up on all the pop culture of which I’ve been so woefully deprived.

I started today like 
most Americans: thinking I knew ex-
actly what it means to be a basic bitch. But, boy, was I schooled on the matter. 
The term by which 
society refers to “extra-regular females” has been around for years. It originated somewhere between the time of David and Goliath, ac-cording to “Oh No They Didn’t” in a 2009 article in New York Maga-zine. 
You might be a little worried at 
this point because, “OMG I posted a #NationalSiblingDay pic yester-day. Am I basic?” 
The short answer is yes, but 
don’t worry about it too much. We’re all a little basic.
Regardless of what you think 
qualiﬁ  es as a basic bitch, you’re probably one in some way or an-other. 
And with that, I present to you 
a list of things to avoid lest you be deemed basic by whatever basic bitch thinks she has the end-all-and-be-all say in what is basic.
So get ready, because this list is 
dense:
In order to avoid being basic, a 
person must not like any Top 40 song. 
Well, you can like one or two, but 
anything more than that equals ba-sic. That’s not too bad because you only listen to Internet radio, and you’re totally stoked for Coachella and the awesome line up, right? Think again. Basic bitches also “LITERALLY LIVE for Coachella.”
Do not like Coachella, don’t be 
excited about Dum Dum Girls or HAIM or Bastille or Ellie Gould-ing or CHVRCHES or MGMT or Kid Kudi or Pharrell Williams or his hat — hold on, I need to catch my breath — Foster the People, Lorde, Neutral Milk Hotel, So-lange, Skrillex, Calvin Harris, Lana Del Rey, Disclosure, Calvin Harris — wait I already said that — I meant Ar-cade Fire. All basic. Did I miss anyone? Basically, don’t like Coachella. Don’t like music festivals or mu-sic: That’s basic.
Whatever you do, 
stay away from pump-kin spice lattes. That. 
Drink. Is. Basic. I don’t care if you like them, only basic bitches drink that kind of latte. As a matter of fact, stay away from Starbucks. Only ba-sics like Starbucks, and that’s why with more than 18,000 stores in the world, it’s one of the most popular coffee companies. So many basics, ugh. You don’t want to be one of them. As a matter of fact, coffee is pretty basic. Stay away from cof-fee.
The only thing more basic than 
liking music or coffee is liking ex-ercise. Do not like cycling. Do not like the elliptical. Do not like core workouts. But most importantly, do not like yoga. Yoga sounds like YOLO, which sounds like basic. 
Good thing you never liked mu-
sic, coffee or working out. Your one and only favorite thing remains unbasic. Shopping, that is. Get in, loser, we’re going — no, stop it right there, quoting “Mean Girls” is basic. And so is shopping. Because clothes are basic. Kreayshawn said it ﬁ  rst, Gucci and Louis are basic. NastyGal is basic. Coach is basic. Yoga pants are basic.
You are basic. So what I’m saying is, you can 
be basic, but not too basic; other-wise you will threaten the Internet. And only basic bitches care what the Internet thinks. 
As @RoyalTrillness once tweet-
ed, “Say ‘basic bitch’ and I swear I’ll slap you wit my strong hand.”
It’s a basic world, and we’re all 
just bitching in it.

ism senior. Her columns appear on Fridays.

The Levin College of Law opened its doors 
to thousands of new students from all over 
the world — online.
Law school faculty created the college’s 
ﬁ  rst massive open online course, an introduc-tory class on U.S. law. The MOOC is hosted on Coursera, a company that offers free, on-line education to anyone with no option for college credit.
“We developed a collaborative proposal 
with eight faculty members,” said Alyson Flournoy, senior associate dean for academic affairs at Levin. “We thought it would be in-teresting and engaging for students to learn from a variety of instructors.”
On Tuesday, Levin had 6,400 people reg-
istered for The Global Student’s Introduction to U.S. Law, and that number will continue to grow, Flournoy said.
There is no deadline for registration, and 
students can sign up for the course at any time during the eight weeks it will be available.
Jennifer Wondracek, head of e-services 
and technology at the law school, is one of the eight professors set to teach the course in May.
“This class is targeted toward undergrad-
uate students, maybe high school students, who show an interest in law and the legal sys-tem,” she said.
Wondracek said the most exciting and 
challenging aspect of teaching the online course is the international audience.
“We’re really reaching out to students,” 
she said. “It’s a good introductory course and offers a glimpse of the UF law school.”
Jaclyn Selden, a 20-year-old UF wildlife 
ecology and conservation sophomore, has taken ﬁ  ve classes on Coursera.“I didn’t want to take both college classes 
and online classes at the same time,” she said. “I also wanted to have the opportunity to take courses just for fun.”
Law faculty began discussing the con-
ception of the course last year with the UF Distance and Continuing Education Depart-ment.
Andy McCollough, associate provost for 
teaching and technology at UF, received an invitation from Coursera for the university to develop online courses.
“At the time, the ﬁ  rst step in developing 
online classes for them was to be invited,” he said. “The next step was to be a member of the Association of American Universities.”
UF became a member of the association in 
1985, McCollough said, and is the only uni-versity in the state to be a member.
The invitation from Coursera came due to 
the university’s academic reputation and par-ticipation in online education, he said.
UF offers a total of 11 courses on Coursera. 
That number will increase by mid-summer to about 13.
McCollough said the university is devel-
oping new insights on online platforms that resident students will beneﬁ  t from.
“Ultimately, we’re enhancing our reputa-
tion and the value of a UF degree,” he said.

� MORE THAN 800 
PEOPLE ATTENDED THE 14TH ANNUAL DRAG SHOW.

Alligator Contributing Writer 
A blonde lady took the Reitz 
Union Grand Ballroom stage 
Thursday night to perform “Wrecking Ball,” but it wasn’t Miley Cyrus. 
Alaska, in a pink sequined 
ﬂ  oor-length gown complete with hip-high slit, sang her own rendition of the song as part of her drag performance. 
More than 800 guests were in 
attendance to see national and local drag performers take the stage in “Sunny with a Chance of Shade: A Drag Show.” 
Pride Awareness Month 
and Reitz Union Board Enter-tainment collaborated to put on the 14th annual drag show, which is continually the big-gest event of Pride Awareness Month, said Bobby Brito, the event’s director. 
The show featured drag 
queens Bianca Del Rio, Court-ney Act and Adore Delano from the current season of “RuPaul’s Drag Race,” as well as Alaska from last season. 
The queens each took the 
stage, performing songs and interacting with guests, who often approached the stage to slip dollar bills to the queens. 
Jay Teran, a 19-year-old 
UF public relations sopho-more and member of the Pride Awareness Month board, said his favorite part was everyone coming to support the drag queens. 
“We’re a minority group, so 
it’s great seeing people come from different communities,” Teran said.Drag queens grace

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
TALLAHASSEE — Florida legislators 
are divided over what type of additional 
tax breaks to offer residents this year.
The Florida House has already passed 
a bill that calls for four sales tax holidays, including a three day back-to-school holi-day. 
The House also wants a tax holiday on 
energy efﬁ  cient appliances, gym member-ships and hurricane preparation supplies.
But a key Senate panel on Thursday 
worked on a tax cut package (HB 5601) that would include just the back-to-school tax holiday. 
Instead the Senate bill includes a cut in 
the state tax charged on cellphones, cable television and home satellite services.
Legislators will spend the next few 
weeks deciding which tax breaks to include in the legislation.
Gov. Rick Scott has already signed into a 
law a measure that rolls back auto registra-tion fees.State discusses 
tax holidaysFRIDAY, APRIL 11, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 9

Last summer, the Dream Team was just a fan-
tasy. 
Now, the student volunteer group runs a pro-
gram with children in cardiac care at UF Health 
Shands Children’s Hospital. 
“It started on a laptop in the Summer of 2013,” 
said president Alex Breslin, a 21-year-old UF biology junior. “We’ve come a long way since then.”
The team consists of about 40 UF pre-med stu-
dents who volunteer on a weekly or monthly basis.
At the beginning of the Spring semester, about 
250 applied for positions on the team.
The group puts on events for the children like 
movie nights and fundraisers. Every Saturday, the Dream Team hosts group bingo, said Shands child life specialist Amanda Huthlett. “If a patient is too sick to come down, the vol-
unteers go with an iPad to their room so that they can still be connected and play the same game of bingo that the other kids are playing,” she said. “It lets them connect with the other children even when they’re in isolation.”
Huthlett said families are excited to have their 
children work with specially trained students. She said the volunteers help patients cope with treat-ment, which shortens therapy sessions. 
The team’s vice president, Liz Kleinfeld, said 
these children often spend extended periods of time in the hospital. 
“Any chance we have to brighten their day is in-
credible,” the 20-year-old UF accounting junior said. “I can’t think of a more worthy way to spend my time here at UF.”Team helps kids in hospital cope

Two local businesses are 
teaming up to promote sustain-
able living through live music at Gainesville’s ﬁ  rst carbon-neutral beneﬁ  t concert.
The JAM, located at 817 
W. University Ave., is hosting Neutral Sounds Beneﬁ  t Con-cert for We Are Neutral today at 5 p.m. 
Ricky Kendall, Nook & 
Cranny, the Hard Luck Society, Wax Wings and Fae, Mariama and Dru will perform. Tickets are $10 each, and all proceeds will go to We Are Neutral, a nonproﬁ  t sustainability con-tractor for businesses. 
In the past, the organiza-
tion worked at Bonnaroo and Gainesville’s Fest to create car-bon offsets.
Eduardo Arenas, 35-year-
old co-owner of The JAM, said people can expect a lot of great music at the concert by musi-cians who express their values through their lyrics.
“One of the major prob-
lems we face is a generation of waste,” Arenas said. “The way we consume and generate trash is one of the things we need to be more mindful of.”
There will be drink specials 
and an auction with prizes ranging from Swamp Head growlers to free massages from the Florida School of Massage, said Brielle Martinez, 22-year-old marketing coordinator at We Are Neutral. The organiza-tion will use the proceeds from the event to buy supplies and cover operating costs.
“We believe that together 
we can inspire a movement,” she said.
Krysten Jachimecki, a 22-
year-old UF history senior, said she  thinks the proceeds are going to a good cause.
The JAM’s staff is also pas-
sionate about sustainable prac-tices, Arenas said. Employees separate the club’s garbage, re-cycle and sell draft beers to re-duce the amount of trash. They also limit plastic water bottle sales by providing guests with a water station and Mason jars.

Alligator Writer @EricaAlyssa
Kytra Hunter battled more than 
nerves at the 2014 NCAA Regionals 
meet. The junior all-arounder com-peted through an illness she’d been fighting the week prior. 
“I had a temperature that was 
over 100 so I like wasn’t really eat-ing,” Hunter said. “My head was just killing me.” 
The week prior to regionals, 
Hunter missed the team’s final practice before departing for Hap-py Valley because she was resting and seeking treatment from the team’s doctor.
She said she was not officially di-
agnosed with the flu or prescribed her any medicine. The doctor’s or-ders were to let the sickness work its way out of her system — a chal-lenge with the two most important meets of postseason looming. 
Hunter said she never consid-
ered missing regionals. 
“I love competing so I never 
ruled that out,” Hunter said.  “It was just more of like, I wanted to get better and get my energy back but that always takes a while after you’re sick.” 
Coach Rhonda Faehn could tell 
Hunter wasn’t her usual self when the Gators arrived at Penn State. 
“I thought we had a tremendous 
practice day but Kytra, she wasn’t there. I mean she was there but she wasn’t there,” Faehn said. “She didn’t do anything in practice day: not a beam dismount, didn’t do a double layout of floor. She said by the end of just running down the vault runway she had no energy to even vault so many times she didn’t go.” Hunter has competed all-around 
for the Gators at all but one meet in the 2014 season. 
“I literally could not feel my legs 
when we were competing because I was just sick and wasn’t eating and doing gymnastics,” Hunter said. “Just all that combined was kind of a mess.” 
The mess resulted in a fall on 
bars and season low 9.25 for Hunt-er. 
“I mean of course it could have 
been a lot better, but also looking at all the mistakes there’s no telling what would have happened if I was feeling 100 percent,” she said.
“Hopefully, I can keep the sick-
ness away because I’ve been sick a couple of times actually this sea-son.” 
Hunter bounced back from her 
fall on bars with strong balance beam (9.80) and floor (9.95) rou-tines.
“I’m just glad I could overcome 
my sickness and be able to do that,” she said. “Having the team be able to count on me especially after go-ing after two falls last weekend and hitting a strong routine. Even though I didn’t score high it was definitely a strong routine for me.” 
Hunter’s fall on bars prevented 
her from placing high in the all-around competition with a total of 38.925 — her lowest of the year. 
But she did manage a win on 
floor, an event in which she’s al-ready scored four perfect 10s so far this season. 
Faehn said that all things con-
sidered, Hunter did well.
“But she was able to pull it to-
gether enough for the competition even though she had a fall on bars but I think that she will be fine,” Faehn said. 
Looking ahead, Hunter said 
she’s feeling better and is working on being the strongest she can be for the three-day NCAA Champi-onship meet in Birmingham, Ala., from April 18-20. 
“I have to be my strongest,” 
Hunter said. “Just making sure that I eat and doing any extra cardio that I need. Just staying with that and making sure that I’m staying fit.”

After five consecutive weekends of 
Southeastern Conference play, Florida will 
take a break from league action this week-end when it hosts Florida A&M and North Carolina State.
The No. 6 Gators (35-8, 8-7 SEC) will 
play the Rattlers (15-21, 3-3 Mid Eastern Athletic Conference) tonight at 6 followed by a matchup with the Wolfpack (25-10, 12-4 Atlantic Coast Conference) on Satur-day at 3 p.m.
With a four-game win streak under its 
belt, Florida is looking to continue its win-ning ways.“We’re not quite through the season 
yet,” Aubree Munro said. “I think it’s just a confidence builder for us and kind of helps us turn it around and build some momentum.”
FAMU is 5-2 in its last 
seven games, outscoring its opponents 42-31. 
Despite the recent suc-
cess, the Rattlers have struggled on offense throughout the season, posting a team batting average of just .254 and 
striking out on 21.7 percent of their at-bats.
NC State, which received votes in the latest NFCA poll, is riding a seven-game win streak and has won 10 of its past 11 contests heading into Gainesville. 
The Wolfpack are third in the ACC with 
a 2.55 team ERA and average 6.37 strike-outs per game.
UF will look to its defense, which is 
the best in the country with a .984 fielding percentage, to continue making big plays during its nonconference matchups this weekend.
“I think all of us are still on the same 
page,” Munro said. “We’re still just work-ing to just get back to grinding and win-ning games.”
Munro has been a key factor in Florida’s 
defense during her first two years at UF. She had a .996 fielding percentage in 
2013, good for the seventh-best mark in Florida history. 
This year, Munro’s fielding percentage 
is still high at .991, and she is second on the team with 203 putouts — the 10th-best mark in the SEC. 
Munro said she feels comfortable be-
hind the plate and has adjusted to the dif-ferent styles of each of UF’s three starting pitchers, especially since she has past ex-perience working with all of them.

Kourtney Keegan returns a ball during Florida’s 4-0 win against 
Harvard on Jan. 26 at the Ring Tennis Complex.

Alligator Writer @ibcohen5
Only a handful of freshmen 
play well enough to be named 
Southeastern Conference Fresh-men of the Week over the course of the season.
On Wednesday, Kourtney Kee-
gan did it for the second time.
Florida’s first-year player was 
named SEC Co-Freshman of the Week for the second time in as many weeks, and the numbers cer-tainly back her up. Last weekend, Keegan won her team-leading 30th doubles match, her 28th over-all singles match, and both of her singles matches in straight sets.
But Keegan doesn’t have much 
time to celebrate her recent accom-plishments as No. 11 Florida (17-4, 9-2 SEC) prepares to face No.  5 Vanderbilt (17-4, 10-1 SEC) today at 3 p.m. at the Ring Tennis Com-plex. 
Today’s dual match may carry 
the most postseason implications of any match this season.
The Commodores appear to be 
the most formidable opponent the Gators will face at home this year. Vanderbilt is in a three-way tie for first place in the SEC standings and hasn’t lost a dual match since March 9 at Texas A&M.
“It’s going to be really tough,” 
coach Roland Thornqvist said. “One thing that stands out with this Vanderbilt team is they have pretty much the same type of player, or quality of player, up and down the line. 
“There are no holes in their 
lineup.”
That sounds familiar. The Gators pride themselves on 
piecing together a complete lineup from top to bottom and may feel as if they’re looking into a mirror when they face the Commodores this afternoon. Picking the correct matchups on Courts 1 through 6 may be the deciding factor in to-day’s contest. 
While the Gators will look to 
play to their strength — depth in singles — they will likely have to control doubles action if they hope to keep their 129-match home win-ning streak alive. Florida will de-pend on its No. 24 doubles duo of Sofie Oyen and Belinda Woolcock, as well as the No. 26 team of Ol-ivia Janowicz and Keegan to set the tone today.
Thornqvist is confident that 
both pairings are equipped for the challenge. 
“They’ve really epitomized 
what we’re trying to do in dou-bles,” he said of both ranked duos. 
“They hit the ball hard, they 
play close to the net, and they have great courage in play calling. When you do that, and you make returns and you make first serves … then you see what they’re bringing right now. They’re beat-ing great teams and they’re doing it the right way.”
The Keegan-Janowicz tandem 
has one loss during dual-match season, with the loss coming on Feb. 8 against Northwestern. The UF duo will likely face Vanderbilt’s No. 32 doubles team of Courtney Colton and Lauren Mira.
“There are no spots where you 
say, ‘Hey, [Vanderbilt is] good there but not so good there,’” Thornqvist said. “They’re good at all six spots, and if you look at their record, they’ve picked up points at [Courts] 1 through 6 in singles, as well as 1, 2 and 3 in doubles.
“We certainly have to be ready 
for them, and our freshmen have to be mature enough to handle it. We’re looking forward to the chal-lenge.”
Freshman excelling late in the season
“One thing that stands 
out with this Vanderbilt team 
is they have pretty much 
the same type of player, or 
quality of player, up and 
down the line. There are no 
holes in their lineup.”

After a long season of highs 
and lows, the No. 15 Gators (12-7, 
7-3 Southeastern Conference) are winding down and entering their penultimate match of the season against Vanderbilt (13-8, 4-6 SEC) today at 5 p.m.
Freshman Maxx Lipman is 
likely looking forward to the match more than anyone else because he will get a chance to compete against his older brother Ryan Lipman, who is a senior on Vanderbilt’s team. 
Both Lipman brothers have 
played well this season, with Maxx recently being named SEC Co-Freshman of the Week and Ryan being ranked No. 3 nation-ally in doubles with Gonzales Austin and No. 60 in singles.
Florida has a few ranked play-
ers as well. At No. 82 is 
freshman Elliott Orkin, No. 97 senior Spencer Newman, No. 106 sophomore Gordon Wat-son and No. 120 senior Florent Diep. Orkin 
and Watson are the only ranked Gators duo at No. 16.
Last season, the Gators de-feated the Commodores at home on April 14 in a 4-1 victory. The match was one to remember. Florida won the doubles point outdoors. Minutes later, the singles matches were moved in-doors due to rain. 
The Gators had no trouble in-
side, and Mike Alford clinched the match. Florida is 37-8-1 all-time against Vanderbilt.
At that point in the season last 
year, Florida was ranked No. 17 with a 14-9 overall record and a 7-5 record in the SEC. 
“We are looking forward 
to this weekend,” coach Bryan Shelton said. “Our guys are very aware of what they need to do to be successful. We have to be physically and mentally prepared as every match in this conference is a challenge, especially on the road.”

Munro provides strong defense, solid bat
circle.
In 2011 and 2012, Munro played on the same trav-
el team — the Southern California Athletics — with 
freshman left-hander Delanie Gourley.
“I’ve caught her for years and I kind of know how 
she works and what her ball does, so that’s not any-thing new,” Munro said of Gourley. “But it’s deﬁ  nite-ly different with a lefty because the pitches are on the opposite side of the plate.”
While Munro has made contributions to Florida’s 
defense since her freshman year, she struggled at the plate to begin her UF career.
In 2013, Munro posted a team-worst .145 batting 
average, logging only ﬁ  ve extra-base hits in 55 at-bats while striking out 17 times.
But Munro has shown strides in her second year 
at UF. 
The sophomore is tied with Kelsey Stewart with a 
team-leading nine doubles. Munro’s batting average has also improved to .259 this season, and her .444 slugging percentage nearly doubles the .255 clip she posted in 2013.
“I’m improved a lot, mostly with my conﬁ  dence,” 
Munro said. 
“I’ve kind of got a better handle on the kind of 
player, especially the kind of hitter, I want to be and my role on the team as a hitter. I’m just understand-ing that and not trying to be anybody different than who I am and what I’m capable of and keeping things simple because that’s what I’ve learned works for me.”SOFT , from page 14KICKOFFINSIDE

When you hit rock bottom, there isn’t 
anywhere to go but up. The Gators hope 
that’s true because 2013 was, by all accounts, a disaster. 
A 4-8 season can be ruinous for a major 
program like Florida, but coach Will Mus-champ has a simple response to those who think he can’t pick this team back up:
“They’re going to see a good-looking 
team,” he said. “We’re going to have a good team next year.”
For his sake, they need to. After a medi-
ocre ﬁ  rst season, a surprising second cam-paign and abominable third season, Mus-champ is down to his last strike.
Saturday’s Orange and Blue Debut will 
be his ﬁ  rst chance to separate himself and the rest of his team from last season. It’s his ﬁ  rst chance to show fans — the majority of whom could not make it to one of the Gators’ open practices — that his team is back on the right track. The game is right on time: The ticket lottery for the notoriously slow-to-arrive and slow-to-purchase fan base opens Monday. 
Muschamp, now wrapping up his fourth 
spring with Florida, certainly has the tools to lead the Gators back to respectability — unlike last season.Muschamp brought in former Duke of-
fensive coordinator Kurt Roper to reform Florida’s anemic offense. After ﬁ  nishing 115th in total offense last year, the Gators were in desperate need of a makeover.
The Blue Devils, typically the doormat 
of the Atlantic Coast Conference, ﬁ  nished 10-4 and barely lost a 52-48 shootout in the Chick-ﬁ  l-A Bowl to Johnny Manziel’s Texas A&M Aggies on New Year’s Eve. 
Roper is looking to bring that explosive-
ness to Gainesville, and Muschamp said the offense is ahead of schedule.
Muschamp said the offense averaged 
more than 5 yards per play at its scrimmage on April 5. Last year, it averaged 4.79.
“I think our guys have a good under-
standing of what we’re trying to do of-fensively,” Roper said. “In 15 days, what you want them to be able to understand is, ‘What is our base? Who are we? What are we trying to accomplish offensively?’ I think they’ve got a good start and understanding on that.”
Roper has a major advantage over his 
predecessor, Brent Pease: a healthy Jeff Driskel, who will make his ﬁ  rst appearance on Florida Field since suffering a season-ending injury there against Tennessee on Sept. 21, 2013.
Driskel looked a little shaky at the start of spring practice, but going into the spring game, he has a ﬁ  rm lock on the starting quarterback spot.
Now that he is back with the team, he 
wants to make sure the team doesn’t have to go through the same kind of disappointment it did last season.
“I mean if you do the same thing con-
stantly, you’re going to get the same re-sults,” he said. “So obviously we’ve got to do something better, put in more effort, put a little bit of extra time in the ﬁ  lm room. But I think we’re on the right track and I don’t anticipate another year like that.”
Roper has praised Driskel’s work 
throughout spring training camp, saying Thursday that he was surprised how mobile the quarterback has been.
But quarterback wasn’t the only position 
where the Gators struggled. In fact, it would be easier to name positions that performed well than those that didn’t.
At running back, Matt Jones suffered 
a season-ending meniscus tear. Freshman wide receiver Demarcus Robinson made a splash in practice but failed to deliver dur-ing the season. UF tight ends combined for four catches and 42 receiving yards. Three offensive linemen missed multiple games with injuries. The defensive line struggled to adapt to the loss of Dominique Easley, who declared for the NFL Drafter after suffering a torn ACL and meniscus on Sept. 24, 2013.
It was too much to take. “It leaves people looking around at each 
other wondering who is going to step up. Who is going to be that guy?” offensive line-man Max Garcia said. “I felt like we lacked some leadership last year.”A semester later, new leaders are emerg-
ing. On the defensive line, Dante Fowler Jr. looks like the most likely candidate to ﬁ  ll Easley’s role. Teammates said Fowler con-fronted for academic issues and is helping whip the team into shape.
Fowler is not interested in going 4-8 
again.
“It’s always in our minds,” Fowler said. 
“They got that reality check. Once that hap-pened, everybody just wanted to buy in and everybody is going to want to listen because they’re hungry and they’re mad, too. Just like we are.”
In the secondary, sophomore Vernon 
Hargreaves III is proving to be a role model for the other cornerbacks.
Hargreaves said he has always gravitated 
toward being a leader, but he had a chance to rely on older players last year. But now, with four defensive backs — senior Jay-len Watkins and juniors Marcus Roberson, Loucheiz Purifoy and Cody Riggs — leaving the program for either the NFL or another school, the sophomore is taking the reigns.
“That’s the role I’m trying to ﬁ  gure out 
right now,” Hargreaves said. “Last year, it was easy to ask them what to do or expect. Now, they’re asking me. I’m still learning how to take that older brother role. It’s a process.”
The team takes its ﬁ  rst real step in that 
process Saturday at 1:30 p.m. in Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium.
The offense will take the ﬁ  eld at Florida 
Field for the ﬁ  rst time and will attempt to wipe out the sour taste last year’s team left in fans’ mouths. But for Roper, it’s just an-other day to keep working at installing the offense.
“I don’t really think of it in those terms,” 
Roper said. “I guess because I wasn’t here I don’t think of it in those terms, you know what I mean? 
“I can’t say that those guys don’t have 
thoughts of it or anything, but I don’t bring it up. It really just doesn’t come up.
“We’re going be who we are, we’re going 
do what we do and let’s go have some fun playing football.”

The Orange and Blue Debut is scheduled to kickoff 
Saturday at 1:30 p.m. Spring practice is a superb chance 
for players wishing to start to separate themselves from those destined to be on the second team. Here are some of the positions to keep an eye on while you watch the game. 
Quarterback: Redshirt junior Jeff Driskel is ready to 
take the reigns of the football team again after recover-ing from the broken ﬁ  bula that ended his season against Tennessee last year. 
The new offense doesn’t ask that Driskel to throw the 
ball much downﬁ  eld, but the scheme allows for quick, ﬁ  ve yard passes. If Driskel can get his conﬁ  dence up, 2014 could be a big year for him. 
Driskel has distanced himself from Skyler Mornhin-
weg and Will Grier, who could split playing time on the team opposite Driskel on Saturday. 
Wide receivers: The position has seen a number of ex-
plosive playmakers emerge this spring. Quinton Dunbar, Ahmad Fulwood, Latroy Pittman Jr. and Demarcus Rob-inson have been impressive throughout. 
Offensive coordinator Kurt Roper likes to use three 
and four receiver sets in order to create space, so several of them could see the ﬁ  eld at the same time.
Gainesville product Chris Thompson has been a sur-
prise this spring, showing impressive speed as well. Driskel’s success this season is contingent upon having consistent targets to throw to. 
Tight ends: Under Roper’s offense, you’ll see tight 
ends being utilized a lot more than you did last year. Tevin Westbrook and Clay Burton — who combined for just four catches all season last year — have progressed during the spring. 
True freshman DeAndre Goolsby has taken signiﬁ  -
cant reps as well. College football teams are using tight ends more and more throughout the country — Florida is following suit this season. 
Offensive line: An offensive line ravaged by injuries 
last season is led by a group of veterans this spring. As a whole, they’ve adjusted to the new tempo well. 
Chaz Green is back from a torn labrum that ended his season last year. He has seen most of the playing time at right tackle.
Max Garcia is the new starting center and has had 
trouble getting off accurate snaps. Roper’s preference for shotgun formations compounds the problem, forcing Garcia to snap the ball several yards behind him instead of handing it to the quarterback.
Defensive line: Bryan Cox Jr. 
has turned heads this spring at the defensive end position — he has had one of the best springs along 
the D-line. 
Darious Cummings has taken reps at both tackle and 
nose guard, disrupting the offense often.  
Dante Fowler Jr. has emerged as a leader at the hybrid 
Buck position — important for a team losing Dominique Easley to the draft.
Alex McCalister has come on strong this spring, and is 
helping the pass rush as well. 
Linebacker: The linebacker corps is loaded with tal-
ent this spring. Antonio Morrison, Mike Taylor, Jarrad Davis and Jeremi Powell have been consistent playmak-ers throughout practices.
Cornerback: The secondary is reloading to ﬁ  ll the 
voids of Loucheiz Purifoy, Marcus Roberson and Jaylen Watkins. All-American cornerback Vernon Hargreaves III has been a consistent lockdown corner all spring.
However, the spot opposite Hargreaves is being bat-
tled out by early enrollees Duke Dawson and Jalen Ta-bor. Both will compete for the starting job this Fall.
Brian Poole has taken reps at corner, but he will like-
ly be at the nickel position. Dawson is competing with Poole there as well.
Safety: The safety spots aren’t solidiﬁ  ed yet, but there 
are a number of guys who have taken reps. 
Redshirt freshmen Nick Washington and Marcell 
Harris are healthy in 2014, and both plan to make an im-pact at safety. Both have required a lot of coaching up in practice, but they’ve responded well. 
Sophomore Keanu Neal has been nagged by a ham-
string this spring, but if he stays healthy he could make big plays at the position. 
Jabari Gorman has proved to be a veteran leader at the 
position for the young guys.

“We’re going to have a good team 
next year.”
Will Muschamp
UF coach ADAM PINCUS
Alligator Staff Writer @adamDpincus 
Jeff Driskel lied writhing in pain at the 47-
yard line. 
Trainers tended to the quarterback who 
just threw a pick-six in UF’s Southeastern Conference home opener against Tennessee.
Defensive lineman Marlon Walls beat left 
tackle D.J. Humphries on a speed rush before 
tackling Driskel from behind. The quarter-back threw a crossing pattern to Demarcus Robinson that cornerback Devaun Swafford slid under for an easy touchdown.
With two team personnel members at his 
side, Driskel walked off on a broken leg, his season done.
“I couldn’t contribute to the team like I 
wanted to. I didn’t really feel helpless. Dis-couraged, I would say, but not helpless. It was tough,” Driskel said. “You know, you work in the whole offseason for the season and then you’re excited for it. You think you’re going to play well, and the next thing you know, it’s gone.”
Driskel admittedly wasn’t playing well. 
The offense grew stagnant. Three turnovers against Miami had people restless. Thirteen turnovers in his previous eight games didn’t make it better.
Although the now-transferred Tyler Mur-
phy played well against mediocre SEC com-petition, it became clear the Gators needed Driskel under center. Florida had its worst quarterback play in decades with Murphy and Skyler Mornhinweg limited in the of-fense.
■   ■   ■
It’s a new year. Driskel is healthy. Florida 
is a new team offensively. Offensive coordi-nator Kurt Roper took over for Brent Pease, who focused more on complex pre-snap mo-tions from under center. Roper spent the last ﬁ  ve seasons at Duke. His work will be on dis-play in the spring game Saturday at 1:30 p.m. in Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium.
The Gators have hurried up the offense, 
limited the pre-snap action and created more space on the ﬁ  eld. Kelvin Taylor said the scheme better ﬁ  ts UF’s quicker running backs. Tight end Tevin Westbrook liked how the position is featured more in the passing game. The offensive linemen have enjoyed the challenge of adjusting to a quicker pace.
For Driskel, the offense is similar to the 
shotgun spread he ran at Hagerty High School in Oviedo, where he became the na-tion’s No. 1 high school quarterback. He’ll run more read-option plays, departing from the Gators’ more conventional approach last season.
Roper doesn’t see any problems with his 
inherited quarterback, who joins a lineage of signal callers — Peyton Manning, Eli Man-ning, Thaddeus Lewis — who have worked with him and mentor David Cutcliffe.
“Jeff is capable of running really any of-
fense you ask him to run, because I think he is a guy that, again, possesses the ability to throw the football, and if you do that you can play in really any style offense,” Roper said. “I think you just see change in college football more and more, and everybody is trying to be more explosive offensively. If you’re going to try to be more explosive, space is obviously a friend to (the) offense.”
There will be explosive plays, Roper reas-
sured on Thursday. All of which will start with Driskel, who dropped 15 pounds this offseason. Roper, a detail-oriented coach, wants his quarterbacks to get the ball out of their hands in less than 2.8 seconds. That will get playmakers the ball, help the offensive line protect its quarterback and fatigue the defense.
“My sophomore year at Maryland, we did 
an up-tempo offense. It really does tire the defense out so much. You get to the second and third series and they’re not even pass rushing anymore,” center Max Garcia said. “We haven’t even scratched the surface yet and we’re doing some big things.”
■   ■   ■
Those things are a hot topic some nights 
in Driskel’s house. He made ﬂ  ash cards to go over plays with roommate, offensive lineman Trip Thurman. He also lives with punter Kyle Christy and former lineman Tommy Jordan.
“I don’t think there’s a time when he’s not 
thinking about football honestly,” Thurman said. “He’s always looking at ﬁ  lm in the ofﬁ  ce with coach Roper.”
Saturday will be Driskel’s ﬁ  rst game in 
nearly seven months since the injury against Tennessee. A photo in a March ESPN story showed his right calf atrophied after getting his cast off six weeks following the injury. The recovery was grueling. Sitting in every quarterback meeting not being able to play was worse.
It is just the spring game, but there will 
be one difference from his last time in The Swamp: Driskel will be running.3, KICKOFF, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, APRIL 11, 2014
