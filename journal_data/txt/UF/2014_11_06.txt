Students walking to class 
may have recently seen the 
familiar sight of Humans vs. 
Zombies players running and 
jumping in their neon orange headbands. But unlike previ-ous years, the eternal enemies 
are now playing against each 
other to help raise money for a cause.
The Humans vs. Zombies 
players are encouraging their teammates to donate to the 
Children’s Miracle Network 
Hospitals.
“We just started working 
with Children’s Miracle Net-work this year,” said Hannah 
Gamache, a 21-year-old UF 
English senior. “We are even-tually going to raise money by getting people to sponsor us for each hour we play. It was a last-minute thing, so we haven’t gotten to advertise a lot, but even $5 a player adds 
up, and we hope to raise may-
be $1,000.”
Yet, without a formal spon-
sor, players hope to meet this goal with their own money.  
“Most of the money comes 
from our pockets,” said Josh-ua Cruz, 21. “Players have to buy their own gun since we 
don’t provide those because 
it would be expensive. Some people spend $100 on equip-ment and makeup and such, so instead they can donate 
some of it and still play.”
Since Tuesday night, UF 
students have been dueling it 
out across campus. Humans 
vs. Zombies is a ﬁ  ve-day 
game of tag where humans must remain vigilant and de-fend themselves with socks and Nerf guns to avoid being 
tagged by the growing zombie 
horde.
As the club’s treasurer, 
Cruz has been reaching out UF Humans vs. Zombies play, fight for a cause 
� BOTH ARE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC.

UF will have two forums dedicated to 
educating students on police and commu-
nity relations as well as this week’s mid-term elections.
The Collective, a group of campus or-
ganizations, will host the forum on police relationships today at 7 p.m. in the Re-itz Union Grand Ballroom. Tony Jones, Gainesville Chief of Police; Darren Baxley, University Police deputy chief; and Santa Fe College Chief of Police Ed Book will participate in a panel at the forum.
The event is a response to the events 
in Ferguson, Missouri, wrote Veleashia 
Smith, director of the Institute of Black Culture, in an email.
“This forum is a way for us to be pro-
active in working with local law enforce-
ment to develop common language and open communications between ofﬁ  cers and students,” Smith said.
The Bob Graham Center for Public Ser-
vice and the Hispanic Student Association 
are also hosting an event today on the re-
sults and implications of the 2014 midterm 
elections. It starts at 6 p.m. in Pugh Hall.
Susan MacManus, political science pro-
fessor at the University of South Florida, and Daniel Smith, a UF Research Founda-tion professor of political science, will be commentating.

Roads, sidewalks and bike boxes won’t be 
enhanced in Alachua County’s near future, 
as voters rejected a 1-cent sales surtax Tues-day that would have addressed transporta-tion issues.
Moving Alachua County Forward, one of 
the questions on this year’s ballot, would’ve raised about $30 million per year and more than $240 million over its full eight years but was rejected by about 60 percent of Alachua County voters. According to Alachua Coun-ty’s Supervisor of Elections’ website, nearly 
40 percent of voters — tallied at 30,555 — were in favor of the measure.
Voters were also in favor of an advisory 
referendum asking Alachua County resi-
dents whether they approved of regulating and limiting campaign contributions from entities like corporations and labor unions. About 72 percent of voters approved the 
non-binding question, which did not directly 
change any laws.
About 80 percent of the funds from the 
proposed transportation tax would have been spent on road repair and maintenance, while the remaining 20 percent for bicycle, pedestrian and bus service enhancement projects.
“That’s where it stands,” said Jeff Hays, 
the Alachua County transportation plan-ning manager. “People weren’t willing to tax themselves with an extra penny.”
While the majority of county voters re-
jected the measure, UF’s on-campus polling locations reﬂ  ected different results. Nearly 60 percent of voters at the Reitz Union approved County transportation tax

Greece and Egypt” today from 
4 to 5:30 p.m. in Library East, 
Room 100. One of the most obvious stylistic features of Athenian black-figure vase 
painting is the use of color 
to differentiate women from 
men. By comparing ancient art in Egypt and Greece, Eaverly uncovers the complex his-
tory behind the use of color to 
distinguish between genders 
without focusing on race. Light refreshments will be served.

of the surtax, as did more than 56 per-
cent at the Phillips Center for Perform-ing Arts and more than 53 percent at the Florida Museum of Natural History.
Roads that would have been im-
proved included Depot Avenue — from Southeast Seventh Avenue to Williston 
Road — and Northwest 62nd Boulevard 
— from Newberry Road to Southwst 20th Avenue, which would’ve been re-surfaced and potentially reconstructed, Hays said.
“A lot of the roadways that we need 
significant maintenance on and that are falling behind on the level of mainte-nance are sometimes not the most heav-
ily traveled areas,” Hays said. “People don’t see them as often so it might not 
be as at the forefront of their minds.”
Transit hours and services would 
have also been extended, he said, along 
with upgrading older buses.
“Some people didn’t want to raise 
taxes at all to cover these things and 
thought it should be covered under the existing budget,” he said.
Marlie Sanderson, the assistant ex-
ecutive director for the North Central Florida Regional Planning Council, wrote in an email that she wanted the 
sales surtax to pass.
“Road maintenance resurfacing proj-
ects are expected to get more expensive 
over time,” she said. “Also, there will be fewer funds available in the future for bicycle, pedestrian and transit projects.”CHABELI HERRERA

When this year’s college freshmen begin their senior year in 
Fall 2017, the Gainesville landscape will be home to a new kind 
of tourist hub – a retail, restaurant, residential and office space all-in-one that will be known as Celebration Pointe.
The 1-million-square-foot, mixed-use project has been in de-
velopment since 2010, with recent leasing partnerships adding momentum to the development’s grand opening.
This week, Gainesville-based consulting and software com-pany Info Tech announced its new headquarters will be moved to the Celebration Pointe development site.
The company joins Bass Pro Shops, Regal Cinemas and Ho-
tel Indigo as the newest partner to take up residence at the site, 
which will be located at the intersection of Interstate 75 and 
Archer Road.
Valerie Riley, senior manager of marketing and communica-
tions for Info Tech, said the company, which has been in busi-ness for 37 years, has been considering moving to a new facility for last 15.
The move from its current space at the Florida Farm Bureau building will give the company an additional 15,000 square feet of space — up to 60,000 from 45,000 — to grow the 200-employee business.
“It’s going to help us recruit and retain the best talent if we 
have a facility where people can access retail, restaurants and nature trails right from our building,” Riley said.  
The added space will allow Info Tech to customize its of-
fices to accommodate the needs of employees, many of whom are also excited for the close proximity to retail and restaurants 
that aren’t available at the current location, Riley said.
Work to prepare the new headquarters began in August, 
and developers expect to break ground in spring 2015.
It will be one piece in a Celebration Pointe site that prom-
ises to be geared toward sustainability and ease of transit, said 
Ralph Conti, a partner in the project’s development.
The Archer Braid Trail will connect Celebration Pointe to 
the Lake Kanapaha Conservation Area — a 100-acre portion of land that was donated to the west side of the project — the Split 
Rock Conservation Area and a bridge that will go over I-75 and 
link the site to Butler Plaza.
“We are sort of the last piece in the jigsaw puzzle,” Conti 
said.
Parking will be located at the perimeters of the Celebration 
Pointe site, but the common area will be environment-, pedes-trian- and biker-friendly, he said. Bus routes will also connect Celebration Pointe to other spots in the city, including UF.
Conti said he also expects the luxury reservation theater to 
be another major draw. Regal theater guests will be able to re-serve their reclining seats ahead of time and have a cocktail or snack from the lounge during the movie.
“It’ll be like being at home,” he said. “It will be the only lux-
ury-seating theater in the Gainesville-Ocala market.”
Conti said he hopes the full Celebration Pointe center will 
provide guests with a one-stop shop for their dining, retail and recreation needs.
“That does not exist in this market,” he said. “We are going 
to create a different atmosphere.”4, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 6, 2014

Dust off your heirlooms and col-
lectables: antique appraisers are in 
town.
The Gainesville Woman’s Club is 
hosting its first ever antique apprais-al event today to benefit schools in Alachua County.
For $5 each, notable dealers will appraise items like antique jewelry, furniture, porcelain and Florida memorabilia from 4 to 8 p.m.
“There are very few places you 
can go where you can get a $5 ap-
praisal from an expert in this field,” 
said Robby Packer, the owner of Re-naissance Jewelers and a certified di-amond appraiser. “Anything could 
walk in the door, and that’s part of 
the fun — to see what people are go-
ing to bring out of the woodwork.”
The club agreed to host the ap-
praisal event at 2809 W. University 
Ave. after Packer proposed the idea.“We wanted to partner with 
somebody who was going to be do-
nating or giving money to the com-munity and they were already doing 
it, so we said, ‘Hey, this is perfect,’” 
Packer said.
While most appraisals require 
owners to leave their pieces at the 
store for some time, the verbal ap-praisals conducted at the club’s “It’s Worth What??!!” event will allow patrons to have their items evalu-ated quickly by experts, without the cost or time a general appraisal 
would usually take.
“People have these wonderful 
treasures, and I think it’s very im-
portant that they know what they have so either they can pass that 
information down to their children 
or grandchildren or sell it for a good 
price,” said Monica Beth Fowler, owner of Delectable Collectables and an antique jewelry appraiser.
“When people don’t know if they should sell their items,” she said, “I tell them that it may be worth this in cash, but in sentimental value, there is no price because it is invaluable.”
Items appraised at the event can 
later be brought to some of the ap-praisers’ antique stores for further discussion about selling their items, Fowler said.
“If someone has interest in sell-
ing, then we can give them a busi-ness card, and they can come to our stores,” Fowler said. “This is a fund-raiser more than anything, so we’re not buying from them right then.”

TAx , from page 1Another resolution passedThe group hopes to raise $1,000
to various organizations trying to ensure 
that future games will be able to raise more money.
“We have been making connections and 
are finally getting money for next semester, so hopefully it will get bigger,” the UF fi-nance senior said.
While preparation has helped the club 
figure out ways to give back to the com-munity, there is no amount of training that helps players prepare for the game.
Gamache said one of the most exciting 
moments for her was Tuesday night from a previous year when she was still a human and the zombies were coming after her.
“All of a sudden the entire zombie pop-
ulation horde started approaching us, so we ran and quietly hid in the bushes as 40 zombies walked by,” she said. 
The game has grown since starting at 
Goucher College in Maryland in 2005, ac-cording to the Humans vs. Zombie’s web-site.
Some players have mastered the art of 
shooting Nerf guns and throwing socks, 
but in order to win, zombies must eat all 
of the humans or the humans must survive long enough to starve the zombies.
“My best war story is the time I went 
to attack a zombie, but my gun stopped working. It was jammed, so I am trying to get it to work. I couldn’t fix it, so I threw it and started to run, but then I tripped,” said Clayton Taylor, a 21-year-old UF his-
tory sophomore. “I ended up on my back 
but didn’t give up. I ended up throwing a sock in the air, and it fell and hit her on the head. It felt really good.”HumAns , from page 1THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 6, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 5

A Gainesville man was arrested 
Tuesday afternoon after he broke into 
his neighbor’s house, robbed him and beat him with a shovel, police said.
When victim 
Keith Torres re-turned home shortly before 5 p.m., he saw a standing ladder underneath an open window outside his house at 5600 NW 
27th St. When he 
went in his front door, he heard the back door open, according to a report.
Torres then went to the window 
and saw 52-year-old Larry Lynard Jackson running through the woods toward his own house, which sits di-rectly to the west of Torres’ home.
When Torres went to Jackson’s 
home to ask him about the break-in, 
he saw his lantern and black skull cap 
on Jackson’s porch. Torres refused to 
leave without getting his belongings 
back, Gainesville Police spokesman Ofﬁ  cer Ben Tobias wrote in an email. 
Jackson then hit Torres in the arm, leg 
and face with a shovel — giving him a cut lip and bruises on his wrist and leg.
When police arrived, they found 
13 DVDs Torres had reported miss-ing. Torres also reported two missing speakers, but those were not found in-side Jackson’s house.
Jackson was arrested on charges 
of burglary, aggravated battery and grand theft. His bond is currently set at $175,000.Police: man robs neighbor, 
attacks him with shovel � THE VOTE WAS NOT UNANIMOUS.

The UF Department of Political Science 
has elected not to create a political science 
major on UF Online.
“There were some concerns raised 
whether it’s possible to match the quality of 
the major program from an online perspec-
tive,” said Ido Oren, political science depart-ment chair.
Oren said the faculty was given a choice. 
There was an informed discussion and a fact-ﬁ  nding process, where they looked at online degree programs from other universities.
UF Online gave a presentation in addition 
to two faculty members: one for creating an online major and one against it, said political science professor Richard Nolan.
“There was no widespread enthusiasm 
among the faculty,” Oren said. “But the vote was not unanimous.”
There are several political science classes 
offered online regularly that are available to 
students registered in UF Online or students 
looking to take the classes to complete a dif-ferent major.
“As members of the faculty, we were giv-
en a choice,” Oren said. “That may change in the future.”About 800 undergraduate political sci-
ence majors are studying at UF, according to the department website.
UF senior Meredith Ryan said political 
science is a great major that challenges and encourages its students to think critically through in-class discussions, and she would have felt cheated if it was offered online.
“You can’t get the interaction and the 
discussion necessary to really break down concepts and apply them to real world situ-ations,” Ryan, 20, said. “Professors want to hear what’s going on in our minds and challenge us. You can’t get that experience online.”
Arizona State University is one univer-
sity already offering its students an online degree in political science.
“Sitting behind a computer screen would 
prevent students from gaining real live dis-
cussions with the amazing faculty we have 
in the department,” she said. “It’s not like a math class where there’s one way to solve a problem. Many of the political science courses here ask more of students than to just ﬁ  ll in a blank and hit submit.”

In parts of the world, women and girls are being killed 
because of their gender, and Britt Riner is coming to UF to 
bring light to this issue.
Riner, interim executive director of Women’s Rights 
Without Frontiers, will be on campus today at 6 p.m. to 
show the documentary “It’s a Girl,” which focuses on 
gendercide, or the killing because of gender, of women in China and India.Riner wrote in an email that gender-
cide is “the civil rights issue of our time” –– even though most students don’t real-ize it.
“Gendercide is like pouring a gas sta-
tion full of fuel onto a raging forest ﬁ  re,” she said.
The Network of enlightened Women 
at UF, which is hosting Riner, is spon-soring the event.
Although the organization is geared toward conserva-tive university women, the NeW at UF secretary Elizabeth Osmun said this event pertains to everyone, regardless of political stance. 
“There’s no argument against what (Riner’s) doing,” 
the 19-year-old chemistry sophomore said.
The event is in the UF Levin College of Law library, 
Room HOL 285C. There will be a Q-and-A session with 
Riner after the showing.
“Only once people know the truth can they be empow-
ered to do good,” she said.Political science dept. decides to keep it simple, stay ofﬂ  ine

campus sexual 
assault must end
In September, the Obama administration launched the “It’s 
On Us” campaign, which aimed at addressing the issue of rape and sexual assault on college campuses.
One reason for President Barack Obama’s decision to launch 
this campaign was likely the horde of conservative pundits and 
commentators who have ﬂ  ooded American media with the no-
tion that the problem of sexual assault at American universities really isn’t so bad after all.
Most notoriously, Washington Post’s George Will wrote a col-
umn in June accusing those advocating against sexual violence of ignoring “pesky arithmetic and elementary due process.”
Will also lamented the existence of “capacious deﬁ  nitions of 
sexual assault that can include not only forcible sexual penetra-tion but also nonconsensual touching.” Is there anything creepi-
er than Will complaining about a deﬁ  nition of sexual assault that 
includes “nonconsensual touching”? Perhaps not.
Last week, conservative radio host Dennis Prager expanded 
on the notion of sexual violence as an overhyped, exaggerated political ploy.
During a voting rally in Sarasota, Prager called the attempts 
to bring awareness to the issue “a gargantuan lie to get votes.”
“It’s as big a lie as the culture of rape on your campuses,” he 
said.
Like Will, Prager also contested the statistic that one in ﬁ  ve 
young women on college campuses are sexually assaulted, a number that has been heavily contested but also has a large body of research supporting it.
Prager then launched into a bizarre diatribe about what does 
and does not constitute sexual assault: “Do you know what sexual assault means? Did you ever look at what counts? An un-wanted kiss is considered sexual assault. I’m stunned it’s only one in ﬁ  ve. Four out of ﬁ  ve women have not gotten an unwant-
ed kiss? My wife gets unwanted kisses every so often.”
Well, it looks like we’ve found something more disturbing 
than Will’s complaint about “nonconsensual touching.”
Of course, the reality is that sexual violence is a serious issue 
at American universities, despite the uninformed, misogynistic 
ramblings of pundits like Will and Prager.
UF students have been made more aware of the problem of 
sexual assault as a result of the repeated incidents on campus in August and September. In recent weeks, several more similar 
incidents have reignited the conversation surrounding issues of 
sexual violence at UF and on campuses across America.
The Obama administration has taken an important ﬁ  rst step 
in addressing this issue through the “It’s On Us” campaign. Other initiatives, like Emma Watson’s “HeForShe” campaign, have also helped bring light to these serious issues, which are still ignored or not taken seriously by administrators at many American universities.
All college students deserve to feel safe and secure on their 
campuses. That sense of security cannot be fully realized until everyone acknowledges the seriousness of the problem of sexual violence.

the election to go the way it did?Today’s question: Do you like online classes?US-Israel relations counterproductive
It’s been a rough week and a half for everybody who 
sits to the political left of Bill O’Reilly.
This, of course, includes everybody working in the 
Obama administration. Not only has the president’s party 
just been decimated in the midterms, but also an anonymous administration ofﬁ  cial made a horriﬁ  c mistake by calling a world leader a “chickenshit” in the Atlantic Monthly.
To make matters worse, this world leader happened to be 
Benjamin Netanyahu, Israeli Prime Minister.
The predictable ﬁ  restorm of moral outrage kicked up al-
most immediately. A blunder like this would have been bad enough had the alleged “chickenshit” in question been, say, Sweden’s Prime Minister Stefan Löfven. But Israel is a whole 
other situation — so politically sacred that our alliance will 
last up to and including the moment one of us ceases to ex-ist. No American who also wishes to have a political career would dream of criticizing the state of Israel directly. This has caused a minor scandal here and overseas, heralded as proof that President Barack Obama really does secretly hate Israel.
The more likely — less conspiratorial — explanation is 
that Netanyahu is very difﬁ  cult to work with. While it’s in-
credibly disrespectful and certainly not OK for someone in 
government to refer to a world leader as a “chickenshit,” pri-vate political discourse is in fact rife with colorful language.
When asked about the comment at a press conference, 
White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said, “My job often involves taking the product you just described and turning it into chicken salad.” This was a reference to Lyndon John-son’s famous use of the epithet, one of his favorite expletives, to describe the ascent of Richard Nixon. “In politics,” John-
son said, “you’ve got to learn that chicken s*** can turn over-
night into chicken salad.” The list of other political leaders who’ve used that very term is extensive and stretches across both sides of the aisle.
This is not the ﬁ  rst instance of colorful language used by 
political leaders — ofﬁ  cials, in this case — behind closed doors and in public. Why did this strike such a painful nerve?
Simply put, this has been the largest visible crack in the 
Israeli-American diplomatic facade in recent memory. Di-plomacy should be a collabora-tive effort. However, in the case of U.S.-Israel relations, our diplo-matic efforts have been so heavily institutionalized they’re really just 
a set of prescribed behaviors that 
overlay frequently resentful coop-eration. We give Israel millions in military aid and use our position on the U.N. Security Council to its 
beneﬁ  t, while Israel’s status as the most successful liberal de-mocracy in the Middle East and its enormous popularity in the U.S. makes supporting it politically lucrative.
This relationship is inherently toxic — even when rela-
tions between our two countries are at their best. It reduces the ideal of diplomatic cooperation through mutual inde-pendence to a situation where both sides just go through the expected motions.
But when tensions are high, as they are now in the wake 
of the construction of new West Bank settlements and clashes in Jerusalem, this relationship is downright counterproduc-tive. In this current state of affairs, our government will be able to do nothing but issue an empty plea for peace.
Time and experience have shown this ploy will not work 
and will leave room for further escalation of the violent rhet-oric and actions of extremists. Netanyahu’s political party, Likud, will forge ahead the right-wing direction the country has taken under his watch, while the Republicans’ victory on nearly all fronts hands him and his allies more sympathy.
The closest we’ve come to peace in our time was the Oslo 
Accords of Yitzhak Rabin, who was assassinated in 1995 by an angry Israeli nationalist. Children born that year served in 
this summer’s military operations in Gaza while ultranation-
alist gangs roamed the streets of Tel Aviv, assaulting Arab and Israeli anti-war protesters alike in a bloody rage. Human rights abuses will continue to go unanswered by our State Department, and this shallow, pathetic state of affairs will go on indeﬁ  nitely

Rolling Stone Magazine called 
him a powerhouse guitarist and 
soulful vocalist, and he’s coming to Gainesville. Blues singer, songwriter and 
guitarist Selwyn Birchwood will perform with his band at the Downtown Blues Concert on Bo Diddley Community Plaza. The free show is Friday starting at  7 p.m. 
The Tampa-raised 29-year-old 
said after he won the Blues Foun-dation’s 2013 International Blues Challenge, a lot of doors began to open up.
The Director of Publicity for 
the Alligator Records, Marc Lip-kin, said he has had his eye on Birchwood for a while.
“He’s a talented young man, a 
gifted musician,” Lipkin said. “He has a bright future ahead.”
Birchwood said he doesn’t 
come from a musical family. Blues was just something he liked to lis-ten to on his own until one day he began to play what he heard on the radio.    
“I got a Jimi Hendrix CD, and I 
was blown away,” he said.
Birchwood said he would pur-
posefully play a Muddy Waters 
CD in his car during a date as a 
test. He would question the la-dies to see if they knew who the father of modern Chicago blues 
was. That was a deciding factor in 
determining if the girl was truly 
worth pursuing.
“Music is so important in my 
life,” Birchwood explained.
He remembers going to a 
Buddy Guy concert when he was 
17 and realizing performing was 
something he wanted to do.
Although his parents wanted 
him to pursue a master’s degree 
after completing his bachelor’s 
in business administration at the 
University of Tampa, they under-
stood it was his dream and sup-ported him.
He said people identify with 
the messages his lyrics contain, 
and that plays a big role in his 
success.
“I try to write from the stand-
point that people will be able to 
relate to,” he said.

One of Gainesville’s beloved 
music venues downtown hosts 
its ﬁ  nal jam Saturday.
“Forever Summer: The Last 
Jam” celebrates The 
JAM’s time open with 
a lineup of 20 national and local bands. The bill includes Bear Creek Festival per-formers Come Back Alice and Captain Green, as well as local producers Bells and Robes. It’s 
sponsored by entities such as 
Organic Visions Presents and Swamp Records.
The JAM recently celebrated 
its two-year anniversary, but venue owner Eddie Arenas never intended for the venue to run for so long.
“From the beginning, The 
JAM was meant to be a short-term project. It was never really meant to run as long as it has been,” Arenas said.
His sister Veronica started a 
business at the location but de-cided to close and continued to pay rent for the unused space. Arenas spotted an opportunity, 
moving his instruments and 
starting up a regular jam night.
“We were supposed to run 
the lease up for ﬁ  ve months, yet here we are two years later,” he said.
The Florida Innovation Hub 
at UF owns the block where The JAM is located from its 
previous running of Shands 
Hospital at Alachua General Hospital, which has since been demolished. They plan to de-molish The JAM among other buildings, including houses that have been standing since the 1890s to build a new hotel in the space.
“My sister and I lived in the 
houses,” Arenas said. “They are historical monuments built in the 1890s despite the hard ﬁ  nancial times of the city.”
Despite the im-
pending closure, The JAM will host events 
until Dec. 5. The last show at The JAM includes a bill with Gainesville-famous bands like Morning Fatty, The Savants of Soul and others.
Swamp Records president 
Breana Auberry also feels The JAM’s closure will leave a void in the local music scene.
“The Jam has a special 
place in my heart and the rest of Swamp Records staff, (it’s) where our ﬁ  rst memories are with Swamp Showcase,” the 21-year old UF advertising se-nior said.
“The vibes in that venue 
can’t be matched,” she said.
While Arenas has no plans 
to start up a new venue, he said he plans to continue supporting the local music scene.
“Running a music venue is 
really demanding. It requires a lot of time and energy,” he said.
“I’m not sure if (venue man-
agement) is something I want to do for the rest of my life,” he said, “but I will always support Gainesville’s music scene.”The JAM plans its last 
jams before closing THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 6, 2014  ALLIGATOR, 9 8, ALLIGATOR  THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 6, 2014

The award-winning reg-
gae band Tribal Seeds will 
bring its San Diego vibes to Gainesville this weekend.
Tribal Seeds, along with 
Ballyhoo! and Beyond I Sight, will play at High Dive down-town on Sunday. Doors open at 8 p.m., and tickets are $17 for those over 21 and $20 for every-one younger.
Tribal Seeds started with two 
brothers, Steven Rene Jacobo and Tony-Ray “T-Ray” Jacobo, in 2005. 
The now six-member group has 
shared a stage with well-known art-ists, such as the Red Hot Chili Pep-pers, Dave Matthews Band, Rebelu-tion, Sublime with Rome, The Wailers and Jane’s Addiction, according to the band’s website.
“We’re just a bunch of laid-back, 
mellow guys,” said T-Ray, the key-
boardist, vocalist and pro-ducer of Tribal Seeds.
The band members from 
Tribal Seeds and Ballyhoo! have known each other for a long time, T-Ray said. Ryan “Gonzo” Gonzales in Beyond 
I Sight is also the drummer 
for Tribal Seeds.
After cruising through four states 
within the week, Tribal Seeds is look-ing forward to crossing into the Sun-shine State. T-Ray said the band has drawn in great crowds from Florida, and last year’s performance at the High Dive on Oct. 30 was nearly a 
sellout.
“High Dive is a great little spot,” 
he said. “We’re gonna give you guys 
a great show.”Reggae vibes downtown

As a local hip-hop collective spreads 
through Gainesville’s underground music 
scene, the six members balance writing, pro-moting and school to work toward the goal of reaching new fans.
Late Nights Early Mornings entertain-
ment group assembled about three years ago. These heralds of hip-hop tote their mu-sical equipment around campus during foot-ball games and events and randomly throw makeshift concerts among large crowds of college students to expand their fan base.
“Our work is relevant to Gainesville’s 
scene because people may see us walking 
around campus and performing at a local 
venue all in the same day,” member Nicho-las Swain said.Swain, 22, is a hip-hop artist and UF tele-
communication senior known by his per-forming alias, Ya Boy Nick Swain. He has been writing music for about nine years.
As a full-time student and full-time musi-
cian, Swain maintains his hectic agenda with diligence and dedication. He said school and 
music take up all of his time now, but he will 
graduate in December and focus on his mu-sic afterward.
“You’ll catch me writing music in class 
and doing homework in between songs,” Swain said. “I try to keep those aspects of my life separated, but sometimes the line be-tween them is blurred.”
Dylan Jones, one of two producers signed 
to LNEM, also balances music and school as he produces beats and attends Santa Fe Col-lege as a business administration senior.
The 22-year-old has been producing music for about six years and worked with about 50 artists. He continues to improve his work by composing beats every day.
“After graduating from school, I want 
music to be my career,” he said. “I want to be an audio engineer owning a studio and tour-ing the world.”
The group maintains a young sound to re-
ﬂ  ect who they are.
“We are all students and student-aged,” 
said LNEM president Jonathan Seays. “The music that we put out and the ways we pres-ent it is a reﬂ  ection of that.”
Seays, 23, has been involved in the music 
business since 2009. He was inspired by pop-ular rapper and entrepreneur Shawn “Jay-Z” 
Carter to start his own record label.
“Our name, Late Nights Early Mornings, 
deﬁ  nes hard work ethic and the fun of pos-
sessing youthful energy,” Seays said. GNV hip-hop collective highlights local artistsGainesville hip-hop collective features local artists

Gerard Weber grew up in Can-
ada listening to Paul Desmond songs with his grandparents. He clutched onto every note the saxo-phone produced and started play-
ing the instrument in ﬁ  fth grade.
Michael Shine stumbled into 
band class as a shy, clueless sixth-
grader. He picked up the brassy saxophone and has been playing it for 10 years.
What they have in common, be-
sides the instrument, is they will both be playing at UF’s Adolphe 
Sax Bicentennial Festival. The 
event celebrates the 200th birth-day of Sax, the inventor of the saxophone.Musicians and students from 
around the world will gather at UF’s Music Building and Univer-sity Auditorium starting today until Saturday. It will be the only festival in the world, outside of Belgium, celebrating Sax.
“It’s hard to imagine myself 
without the saxophone,” said We-ber, a second-year UF music grad-uate student.
He moved from cold Canada to 
sunny Florida in August 2013. His friends warned him multiple times about his wooden saxophone reed growing mold once he moved.
As soon as he got to UF, he took 
it out and saw black spots all over it, transforming his reed into a musical leopard overnight.
“It was my welcome to Flori-da,” Weber said.
Originally from Belgium, Sax 
went bankrupt three times and was spied on by rivals after he moved to Paris. He also invented the saxhorn and saxotromba.
“He has a sad story, but he was 
a genius,” said Jonathan Helton, a UF professor and the festival host.
The event will have master 
classes by international guest artists, a documentary and con-certs showing saxophone music through the ages.
“The saxophone is a popular 
instrument, but people will be 
able to see the many faces of it,” 
Helton said. “Plus, they can meet saxophonists from all over the world, which doesn’t happen ev-ery day.”The festival kicks off today with 
a UF Wind Symphony Concert at 7:30 p.m. in the University Audi-torium. The piece will emphasize the versatility of the saxophone, showing that it’s not just for jazz music.
“I don’t get nervous anymore 
because I’ve done thousands of concerts, but there’s always a mu-sical aspect to performing that I get caught up in,” Helton said. “It’s a very moving experience.”
On Friday, students from Flor-
ida, Georgia and Wisconsin will perform a concert of saxophone 
chamber music, and lectures about 
the entrepreneurial side to music.
There will be concerts spanning 
the history of the saxophone on Saturday.

A fruity face is ﬁ  nding fame 
from a UF student’s Instagram.
George the Pineapple debuted 
on the Instagram account people-
andapineapple last month, which has gained 455 followers and counting.
The famous fruit is never 
caught without his signature re-ﬂ  ective sunglasses, though they aren’t to protect his pineapple eyes.
“It’s probably one of the stron-
ger fruits out there,”photographer 
Chehade Boulos said. “It’s a fruit 
with an undercut.”
The 20-year-old telecommu-
nication junior does three photo shoots a week on average, looking for nothing but fun and a small fee for his time.Boulos has expanded his port-
folio, having photographed 28 people and a kitten with the pine-apple so far.
One-third of the people who 
reached out to him on Instagram for photos were strangers, he said. 
Even the UF track team plans on 
getting its picture taken with the fruit.
People can choose the place for 
the photoshoot, but they have to dress “somewhat semi-formally.”
The black-and-white photos 
are taken around sunrise or sun-set — when the lighting’s right. 
Boulos brings the pineapple, his 
camera and tripod and begins tak-ing photos.
George the Pineapple’s popu-
larity has grown to where most recognize what’s going on when he’s in the middle of photos, Bou-los said.The simplicity of his success 
was spur of the moment: It began when his mother snapped a photo of him in the summer wearing a button-down shirt while lounging in a pool with the pineapple. Next time, he was behind the lens.
Boulos said he sees it as a great 
way to spend his time and hopes it will keep spreading.
“I kind of see it as a best-case 
scenario, worst-case scenario: At the very least I’ve had fun with people, and it’s a nice kind of thing to add to my portfolio,” he said. “The worst-case scenario 
is ‘Oh, the hype just rolled out. 
It happens. But I had some fun, made some friends and a little bit of cash.’”

The small, concrete patio be-
tween Boca Fiesta and Palomino 
Pool Hall is a community hub of sorts: Mondays it houses crowds for karaoke night, and Thursdays 
it amasses teams for trivia compe-
titions.
The Backyard @ Boca Fiesta & 
Palomino has been the host of holi-day parties and the stage for ﬂ  edg-ling comedians, and this year it will also serve as a venue for local artists to sell their work during the 33rd Annual Downtown Festival & Art Show.
Craftwerk Vol. II will take place 
Saturday in The Backyard, 232 SE First St., featuring an arts and crafts display and a rafﬂ  e for prizes donated by local businesses.
This is the event’s second year, 
and organizer Danielle Kay said she couldn’t be more excited.
“Last festival was our ﬁ  rst one,” 
she said. “And it went fabulous.”
The aim of the festival is to give 
local artists a chance to showcase and sell their work without having to compete with some of the more prominent artists at the Downtown Festival.“There’s something to be said 
for getting to see who’s making things, and (The Backyard) is a perfect place to showcase it,” said Keri Smith, the bar manager at Boca Fiesta and co-organizer of the event.
Last year, 14 vendors sold a 
number of different items from homemade terrariums, which Kay 
said were some of the biggest sell-
ers, to jewelry and knitted koozies.
There will be even more ven-
dors this year, she said, including an artist who makes banjos out of cookie tins.
While she emphasized how important it is to support local talent, Kay also em-
phasized giving back to 
the community.
As part of the event, 
Gainesville businesses such as Satchel’s Pizza, Anthem Tattoo, Pop A Top Corner Store, Spin Cycle, Boca Fiesta and Palomino donate gift certiﬁ  cates for the rafﬂ  e.
Tickets are $1 each, and winners 
are announced every hour, Smith explained.
Once the rafﬂ  e is over, Kay said 
the money raised will be given to a local charity that she and Smith want to raise awareness for.
This year, proceeds gathered 
from the rafﬂ  e will be donated to Interface Youth Program Shelters, which provide 
temporary living space and 
counseling services to trou-bled teens.
The rafﬂ  e and craft fair 
are good opportunities to bring awareness to not only Gainesville artists, but also 
local charities that people don’t know about, Smith said.
“A lot of people in town don’t 
know that (Interface) exists,” Kay said, “that there’s a place for teens to go.”
The rafﬂ  e and art sale are from 
10 a.m. to 6 p.m., and Boca Fiesta will open early for the festival and have happy hour all day at the bar. There will be no cover.

Lewis named to women’s basketball All-SEC second team
UF women’s basketball redshirt senior Kayla Lewis was named to the

Former UF softball player Hannah Rogers will continueh her career as she was signed a two-year contract with the USSSA Pride on Wednesday.Billy Donovan and the UF men’s basketball team begin their season today. Read the story on Page 15.JORDAN MCPHERSON
Alligator Staff Writer @J_McPherson1126
Antonio Morrison has work ethic.
He treats every rep like it’s his last.And the results are showing on the 
field.In Florida’s 38-20 win against Georgia 
on Saturday, Morrison tallied a career-high 15 total tackles, marking the fourth time in five games that the junior had  double-digit 
tackle outing.
“Every practice, I go as hard as I can,” 
Morrison said. “I treat it like a game. You know, I get on guys and try to make the 
best out of our defense and our team.”
Through seven games this season, Mor-
rison has a team-best 67 tackles. His 9.6 
tackles per game ranks third in the South-
eastern Conference.
Defensive coordinator D.J. Durkin said Morrison is peaking at the right time.
“He’s been practicing really well, he’s 
been consistent with how he performs ev-
ery day with us, which is great,” Durkin 
said. “I think he’s really stepped up as a 
leader. All those things combined. … in his 
play it really shows.”
Morrison’s teammates are noticing his 
commitment.
“He’s always the guy who’s getting us 
going,” cornerback Vernon Hargreaves said. “He’s going to call you out if you’re not doing what you’re supposed to be do-ing. And it shows on the field on Satur-
day.”
Durkin said Morrison isn’t the most 
vocal player on the defense, but that isn’t 
stopping him from being a leader. 
“A lot of times the people think the lead-
ers are the ones who are speaking up and 
being rah-rah. That’s not it on him,” Durkin 
said. “Guys notice who’s practicing hard and preparing the right way, and that’s what he’s doing every week. And it’s carry-
ing over into the games.”
Replacing Neal: Florida will be without 
a key cog in its secondary against Vander-
bilt.
Safety Keanu Neal, who suffered a high 
ankle sprain against Georgia on Saturday, 
will be viewing the game against the Com-
modores from the sidelines.
“Keanu is a great football player, he has 
played really well for us,” Durkin said. “He’s productive, flies around and makes a lot of plays. Anytime a guy goes down, it’s part of the game and the next guy has 
to step up and there can’t be a drop off in 
production. I think we’ll be fine.”
Despite Neal’s absence come Saturday, 
Durkin said Florida’s depth will keep it 
from experiencing a major dropoff.
One of those players is Marcus Maye.
During the Gators’ win against the Bull-Notebook: Morrison growing into leadership role on defense
ALEX MAMINAKIS
Alligator Writer @alexmaminakis
 Losing a game in penalty kicks 
is hard enough. 
Losing in the first round of the 
Southeastern Conference tourna-
ment as the No. 2 seed doesn’t make it much better.
No. 8 Florida (14-4-1, 9-2 SEC) 
fell to Tennessee (10-9-2, 4-6-1 SEC) by way of penalty kicks 5-4 in Wednesday’s quarterfinals of the SEC Tournament in Orange Beach, Alabama. The final score was 1-1.
It was a hard-fought match. The penalty kick round followed two ten-minute overtime periods in which neither team scored. Not even one round of penalty kicks was enough — there needed to be two.
At the beginning of the match, 
Tennessee was quick to get on the board and scored in the third minute off of a goal from senior Cheyenne Spade. Florida would respond just before halftime with a goal from senior Annie Speese in the 44th minute.
Speese missed Florida’s last game against Vanderbilt and wasn’t expected to play many minutes. She played 77 minutes on Wednesday.
This was as even a match as the 
Gators have played all season, in part because Florida didn’t look as sharp as it has proven to be.
“I still think we have some men-
tal lapses defensively, it’s just basi-cally getting caught ball watching,” coach Becky Burleigh said. “We have to really make sure that we have better communication, bet-ter focus on not getting caught just watching the ball.”B u r l e i g h 
said Florida’s mistakes are fixable and the 
Gators will work to fix them in their 
preparation time before the NCAA 
tournament begins next week.
A big component of Wednes-
day’s match was the physicality and 
intensity between the two sides. 
In a game that saw four yellow 
cards and one red card, the officiat-ing crew was kept busy, not to the liking of the players and coaches.
“We don’t really have control 
over that,” Burleigh said regarding 
the management of Wednesday’s 
game by the officials. “It was a game that had a lot of stoppages. It felt like we were playing basketball quarters.”
Florida was disappointed after 
the early exit from the tournament 
on Wednesday, but it knows the 
NCAA Tournament still lies ahead. 
The Gators will take advantage of the opportunity to get some rest and look to bounce back in their 
next tournament.
“The SEC Tournament is great 
for teams that need wins to get in 
the NCAA Tournament,” Burleigh said. “For teams like us, it’s an op-
portunity to play more games but 
not necessarily helpful in the big 
scheme of things.”

The Gators have a tough test ahead of them. 
The long road to rebuild starts with Florida’s ex-
hibition game against Barry University tonight. 
The 7 p.m. tip-off marks the ofﬁ  cial start on how 
long it will take coach Billy Donovan to get his team 
to where it left off last year: a loss in the Final Four.
But Donovan faces a different challenge in coach-
ing a young team as opposed to the four senior start-
ers he relied on in the 2013-14 season. 
Though he said the Gators have made strides 
physically, Donovan added they are not quite where he wants them to be in both cohesion and size.
“Us being undersized 
and that is going to have 
to be a challenge and a 
priority for us on Thurs-
day night,” Donovan said on Tuesday.
Florida’s projected starting lineup includes three 
guards in sophomore Kasey Hill, junior Michael Fra-zier II and redshirt junior Eli Carter. Redshirt junior forward Dorian Finney-Smith and center transfer Jon Horford will likely also make the cut.
“I’m almost trying to do some of these lineups, so 
to speak, because we’re going to be dealt with that hand there,” Donovan said.
Horfod believes the team will manage while 
sophomore Chris Walker sits out the ﬁ  rst three games of the season and transfer Alex Murphy sits out the fall for breaking team rules and awaiting NCAA eligibility, respectively.
“It’s something we have to deal with. I don’t think 
we think about too much, one way or another. We 
just have to play,” Horford said. “We know what we 
have to do. We know we’re not where we want to be. We know we’re not where we’re going to be. It’s just something we have to handle.”
If Carter plays tonight, it will be his ﬁ  rst game 
since suffering a leg injury in February 2013 before transferring to Florida from Rutgers. The injury forced the transfer to miss most of last season while he rehabbed. 
In the seven games that he was able to make an 
appearance, Carter totaled 53 minutes and made just one three-point shot against North Florida in his Florida debut. At the start of 2014-15 practices, Carter was recovering from an ankle injury, Dono-van said.
“Eli is moving a lot better. I think he’s got to get 
better conditioning a little bit,” Donovan said. “He is pushing, and we haven’t had to sit him out at all. That’s been good.”
Barry’s projected starting lineup includes a large 
and experienced group of three guards and two for-wards, whom are all upperclassmen.
The Louisville Cardinals defeated Division II Bar-
ry 91-71 in an exhibition game on Saturday.
“I watched a little bit of the ﬁ  rst half yesterday,” 
Donovan said on Tuesday. 
“(Barry is) a very physical team. They’ve got 
ﬁ  ve guys that all played Division I. They all trans-ferred in there. They’ve got big strong physical guys around the basket. That’s going to be really, really important. I thought in the game, at least in the ﬁ  rst half they did a tremendous job of coming down with those longer rebounds out of rotations, those kinds 
of things.”
Donovan noted a weakness in his team’s size in 
the backcourt. 
He listed Dillon Graham, Carter, Frazier, Hill and 
Chris Chiozza (who are all under 6-foot-4) as a part 
of the potential weakness. 
Donovan said he will look to Frazier to makeup 
for that weakness by contributing rebounds.
“He provided a lot of help for us his freshman 
year rebounding the basketball, like he’s going to have to rebound the ball some,” Donovan said. “And Michael is a good rebounder, but I think he’s got to do a better job of getting in there and rebounding for us and helping us in our frontcourt.”Florida begins season tonight 
with exhibition against Barry
UF Bask etballThe game of football is 
cruel by design. Run as fast as you can and 
collide with the person in 
the other color shirt. Take 
him down by any means 
necessary at times. 
That’s inherent to the 
nature of the game, and we 
get it, but it hits you in your core when it becomes not about just the game, but also about humanity, about 
longevity and livelihood. 
That’s why Marcus Lattimore retired 
Wednesday.
I didn’t realize it at the time, but the 
last time I would see Lattimore at his 
best was while I was walking into the 2012 Florida-Georgia game. 
That day, I walked into the stadium 
as the CBS pregame show was playing 
on the TVs throughout EverBank Field. 
They showed highlights of Lattimore running during a three-point South Car-olina victory that day. I didn’t watch the whole package, as I was on my way to my seat.What I didn’t see un-
til later that night was the simple carry that effectively ended his football career.
The guard pulls left and 
South Carolina runs power, a play Lattimore with all his God given ability must have executed thousands of times. 
A linebacker hits him 
high, a defensive back hits him low, his leg ﬂ  ops gruesomely and he rips his hel-met off in anguish while the trainers at-
tend to him — you know he knows what 
this means. 
If you’ve had a knee injury, one of 
your biggest fears is having it happen to you again. I tore my ACL sixth months before Lattimore’s incident against Ten-nessee that day. 
The fear is real.I was introduced to Lattimore dur-
ing his freshman year like many of you were.
He roared onto the scene and then 
backed up the hype most poignantly to the tune of 212 yards on 40 carries against the Gators. South Carolina clinched the Southeastern Conference Eastern Divi-sion in Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium that night while Lattimore ran, and ran and 
ran and ran. Florida had no answer.
The next season, he tore his left ACL 
and his MCL in a game against Mississip-
pi State. You felt bad for him and prayed he would be back healthy. He came back for the next season and then, damnit, it happened again in the matchup against Tennessee. That time he tore three liga-ments in his right knee.
Why him? Why a player with so much 
promise and natural ability — not saying of course that I’d wish the fate on anyone — but it seems like a double gut punch when you think of his promise and his potential.
The what ifs will haunt those that 
enjoyed him play. I can’t imagine how much they will stay with the man who 
lived through the rehab, fought to get 
into shape, achieved his dream by being drafted into the NFL only to come to the realization Wednesday that his knee in-jury was “insurmountable.”
Insurmountable, deﬁ  ned as some-
thing being “Too great to overcome.” Synonyms: unconquerable, indomitable and unbeatable.
That’s the word he used to describe 
his plight in the statement he released announcing that his professional football career was done. The hope exhausted, all avenues are a dead end, the dream done.
He’ll return to the school that gave 
him a stage to showcase his talents to ﬁ  nish his degree, to satisfy the “student” part of student-athlete. His quarterback believes he’s in capable hands.
“It’s unfortunate that he’s retiring. It’s 
hard to cope with that kind of injury, but he’s going to be just ﬁ  ne doing whatever he ends up doing. The people of South 
Carolina will take good care of him,” Ste-
phen Garcia told alligatorSports. 
And so Lattimore enters into a new 
beginning.
There’s no telling what lies ahead 
for Marcus Lattimore in the distant fu-ture, but here’s hoping whatever it is, it’s attacked with the same intensity he brought to opposing defenses. 
He’ll certainly be missed on fall week-
ends.16, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 6, 2014

Lattimore retiring is a loss for the sports world
dogs, Maye — who has been inconsistent 
throughout the season — made one of the key defensive plays on Saturday.
With Florida up 31-13, Georgia had fourth 
and goal from the 2-yard line with less than 
six minutes remaining in the game.
UGA quarterback Hutson Mason threw a 
pass to wide receiver Michael Bennett, only 
for Maye to break up the pass and stop the 
Bulldogs from making it a two-possession 
game.
“It was great because we talk so much 
about ﬁ  nishing the play, ﬁ  nishing the tackle, 
ﬁ  nishing everything we do and that’s a great 
example of ﬁ  nishing,” Durkin said. “That was 
a 50-50 ball that could’ve gone either way. Ei-
ther guy could have ﬁ  nished that play, and Marcus did. He ﬁ  nished it and got it out.”
In addition to Maye, a slew of younger 
players are earning more playing time. 
And they will need to play when their 
number is called.
“They have to step up, you know, Mar-
cell [Harris], Nick [Washington], you know, 
Duke Dawson, they all have to step up,” 
Hargreaves said. “It’s not whether they want 
to or not, and they’re coming along, they’re learning the game plan, and I guess coach will make a decision later on in the week.”
Late mistakes can prove costly: Florida 
had the victory in hand when Georgia went on offense for the last time.
But when Georgia marched 75 yards down 
the ﬁ  eld in 10 plays to score a touchdown with three seconds left in regulation, Durkin was not pleased.
“I think a big message for our guys no 
matter the situation, go through any scenario you want, we need to play the same way,” Durkin said. 
“It’s a certain standard of how we play. I 
don’t feel on that last drive, I feel we were kind of were enjoying a victory already and the game was not over.”Maye makes
