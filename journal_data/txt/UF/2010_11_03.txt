Republicans were able to keep Florida’s 
U.S. Senate seat red and sweep the state’s 
cabinet Tuesday night, but as of press time Democrat Alex Sink was refusing to concede the gubernatorial race to Rick Scott.
As of 12:45 a.m. today, the race for governor 
was still officially undecided. Sources from the Sink campaign said they believed the final tal-
ly would be within 20,000 votes, triggering a 
recount. Problems were reported with count-ing the ballots in Hillsborough. 
Rick Scott, a wealthy businessman, had a 
slight lead over Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink. In Alachua County, Sink won with 63 percent of the vote over Scott’s 36 percent.
Patricia Aguerrevere, a fourth-year art his-
tory student at UF, said she wasn’t happy with either of the candidates but voted for Scott. 
“It’s more of a lesser-of-two-evils kind of 
thing,” she said. “I’m a conservative and Rick Scott was more conservative than Alex Sink. It was more that Rick Scott would do less dam-age. They’re both bad.”
Kristin Klein, president of UF College Dem-
ocrats, said Scott winning would be a tragedy for Florida, adding, “I think people [would] quickly recognize the mistake.”. 
And while the Democrats were trounced 
across the state, Klein said she was happy with how hard the UF Democrats campaigned. 
Unlike the gubernatorial race, the outcome 
of the Senate race was called by the Associated Press just after 8 p.m. — only minutes after the polls closed in the panhandle. Marco Rubio won 48 percent in the state, compared to Gov. Charlie Crist’s 27 percent and Congressman Kendrick Meek’s 20 percent. 
Rubio also won Alachua County with 38 
percent, while Crist had 30 percent and Meek finished third with 28 percent. 
Republicans swept the cabinet races, with Pam Bondi as attorney general, Jeff Atwater 
as chief financial officer and Adam Putnam as 
commissioner of agriculture.
Florida voters also passed three of the six 
constitutional amendments on the ballot, which each required 60 percent approval. Amendment 4, which would have given 
citizens a vote on changes to development plans failed to pass.  Amendments 5 and 6, which aim to end unfair legislative redistrict-ing, passed. The amendments could have an 
enormous affect on the state’s legislature in future election years.  V oters also passed a 
property tax discount to active military per -
sonnel.  Amendment 8, which would have loosened the state’s class size requirements, and Amendment 1, which would have ended 
public-campaign finance, failed to pass.

STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) — It is as-
sault charges for Spider-Man and Captain 
America, and breach of peace for Poison Ivy. Police in Connecticut said a man dressed as Captain America and another as Spider-Man have been arrested after getting into a fight in Stamford over the Halloween weekend.
Stamford Police Lt. Elizabeth Erickson 
said officers found 25-year-old Michael Sanchez, dressed as Captain America, beating the father of 21-year-old Vincent DeCarlo, sporting a Spider-Man costume, in a parking garage Sunday morning.
The Stamford Advocate reported that 
DeCarlo allegedly punched Sanchez of Stamford as police tried to break up the scuffle.
DeCarlo’s girlfriend, 18-year-old Ni-
cole Bitterli of Toms River, N.J., dressed as Poison Ivy, also hit Sanchez.

Block tuition at UF might take 
one step closer to becoming a real-
ity as Florida’s Board of Governors meets on campus today and Thurs-
day to discuss the measure, among other statewide concerns.
The board, which is the State 
University System’s highest govern-ing body , will convene at Emerson 
Alumni Hall for two days of meet-ings that will touch on issues con-cerning the state’s universities, such as the question of whether univer -
sities should be permitted to offer academic programs located in areas close to other state universities.
Charging market-rate tuition for 
distance-education graduate stu-
dents and switching to a block tuition sys-
tem for undergraduates are two is-sues to be discussed that would di-rectly affect UF.At the Thursday meeting, the 
board will vote on whether to change regulations that would al-
low university boards of trustees to 
approve and charge block tuition and market-rate tuition for graduate students taking online distance edu-cation classes.
UF spokesman Steve Orlando 
said UF is the only university in Florida pushing for block tuition, a measure that has already proven unpopular with some students.
He said some of the opposition 
may result from students’ unfamil-iarity with the system.
“There’s a lot of misunderstand-
ing about block tuition,” he said. “It does not have any requirement for taking any number of credits.”

Senators heard a little bit about 
block tuition during Tuesday’s 
meeting. 
University Provost Joe Glover 
told senators that students would 
still be given Bright Futures tuition 
assistance based on how many credit 
hours they take, but they would be 
charged a flat fee. 
He said UF’s decision to imple-
ment or not implement block tuition is separate from the state-funded Bright Futures program, and that Bright Futures would not be changed based on what UF decides.
He said students with Florida 
Prepaid would not notice a differ -
ence with their financial aid either.
The Senate also unanimously ap-proved a resolution calling for the expansion of sustainable education opportunities on campus, in the 
forms of sustainability minors and 
majors and sustainability-related 
courses. 
According to the resolution, sena-
tors hope UF can achieve zero waste by 2015 and carbon neutrality by 
2025.
“We really need to have a push 
for more sustainability within edu-
cation,” said Bailey Kilbourne, an 
author of the bill and agency head for Gators Going Green.Provost pitches tuition

 THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
NEW YORK — A man accused of lying 
about a failed plot to join the U.S. military 
and team up with insurgents in Iraq was jailed without bail in his first court appear -
ance Tuesday since his arrest last month.
Abdel Hameed Shehadeh, a skinny 21-
year-old from Staten Island who was arrest-ed in Hawaii, didn’t enter a plea to charges he made false statements to U.S. authorities investigating an international terrorism.
There was no immediate response to a 
message left Tuesday with his attorney.A criminal complaint unsealed last 
month said the FBI and the New York Po-
lice Department had been investigating 
Shehadeh “and several other individuals in connection with a plot to travel overseas and wage violent jihad against the United States and other coalition military forces.”
The complaint alleged that Shehadeh, 
who was born in the United States, initially caught the attention of U.S. authorities by buying a one-way ticket to Pakistan in June 2008. Once he arrived there, Pakistani offi-cials wouldn’t allow him into the country and he returned to New York. In October 2006, the complaint said, Shehadeh went to Times Square to try to join the Army. It said 
when a recruiter asked him if he’d traveled overseas, he lied and said he’d only been to 
Israel. Later that month, Shehadeh tried to 
fly from Newark, N.J., to Jordan, where he 
again was denied entry. Once he returned to the United States on a flight to Detroit, counterterrorism investigators confronted him about what they say were radical writ-ings and videos he posted on the Internet.
The complaint said Sheha-
deh insisted he tried to go to Pakistan for religious, not mili-tary, training. But witnesses 
who knew him told investigators that he in-structed them that it was the duty of Mus-lims to fight jihad — and that signing up in Times Square was the best way to achieve 
his goal.Shehadeh “informed (one witness) that 
he hoped to be deployed to Iraq,” the com-
plaint said. “At the time he was applying 
to join the military, Shehadeh told (the wit-ness), when he arrived in Iraq, he intended to commit ‘treason’ and fight United States soldiers.”
The complaint said Shehadeh traveled 
to Hawaii in April 2009. There, he bought an airline ticket to Dubai in June, but was intercepted by FBI agents who told him he was on a “no fly” list. In subsequent inter -
views, he allegedly admitted he had hoped to join the Taliban and receive “guerrilla warfare” and “bomb-making” training, the complaint said.
No new court date was set.

A small, 55-million-year-old, 
tree-climbing rodent might be 
distantly related to you.
A study co-authored by a UF 
researcher that describes the cra-nial anatomy of the now-extinct species was published Oct. 11 in the Zoological Journal of the Lin-
nean Society. 
Researchers have found that 
Labidolemur kayi shares a com-
mon ancestor with tree shrews, rodents, lemurs and primates.
“This gives us a window of 
insight into the pattern of evo-lution that led to humankind,” Doug Boyer said during a phone 
interview. 
Boyer,  who is a co-author of 
the study, is the assistant profes-
sor of anthropology and archeol-ogy at Brooklyn College. He said 
the study was prompted by the 
most complete skeleton of the species ever found. 
When they find a Labidol-
emur, it’s usually just a tooth, or the cranium is usually squashed completely flat, said Jonathan Bloch, another co-author of the study. He is the associate curator 
of vertebrate paleontology at UF.
The remains were found over 
10 years ago in Clarks Fork Ba-
sin, Wyo. However, removing the fossil from the limestone that surrounded it was a tedious pro-
cess.After the fossil had been pre-
pared from the limestone it sat in, 
researchers took high resolution CT scans of it, Bloch said. The scans involve taking thousands of X-rays and blending them to-
gether to create one seamless 
image that can be viewed from multiple angles. For every inch of fossil, they take close to 1,000 
X-rays. 
Once all of the scans were 
complete, they were able to get 
a glimpse at what the animal looked like. It resembled a tiny 
squirrel with big ears, long fin-
gers and a bare tail with a puff of fur on the end, Bloch said.
“Based on the large brain size, 
we were also able to tell that this animal was fairly intelligent,” Boyer said.
Using a method known as 
comparative morphology, re-
searchers were even able to tell 
how and what L. kayi preferred to eat, Boyer said. Comparative morphology takes bone struc-
tures of extinct animals and com-
pares them to bone structures of creatures that are living.
Bloch said that even the way 
the animal ate was bizarre. L. 
kayi used its long fingers to tap 
on trees and its large ears to lis-ten. Once it found a hollow spot, it would gnaw at the bark of the tree to find grubs inside it.
It filled an ecological niche 
that woodpeckers now fill.
He said that another thing that makes the L. kayi species notable 
is the time in which they lived. 
Dinosaurs roamed the earth and dominated most environments until 65 million years ago when 
they went extinct.
“With the extinction of the 
dinosaurs, things really opened 
up,” Bloch said. “Mammals were given a much greater opportunity 
to excel.”
The first mammals that took 
over from the dinosaurs provide 
the basic blueprint that nearly 
all mammals follow to this day, 
Bloch said.
He said that this study focuses 
primarily on the skull. Within the next year they hope to have 
a follow-up study to analyze the 
entire skeleton.
Even though L. kayi shares a 
common ancestor with humans, 
Boyer emphasizes just how far 
back this ancestor is.
“It is really quite far down the 
line,” he said. UF researcher discovers human ties to tree rodents

Students gathered in the Reitz 
Colonnade on Tuesday to pick up 
free prizes, free food and informa-tion about off-campus student liv-ing.
 Student Government spon-
sored the off-campus housing fair, which featured representatives from 59 local apartments, busi-nesses and townhouses, hoping to 
lure students who were searching 
for housing. 
“The turnout is about equal 
[to previous fairs],” said Lauren 
Ettlinger, a member of SG. “It re-
ally picks up around lunchtime when people come out for the free pizza.”
The fair, which takes place once 
during both the spring and fall se-mesters, began at 10 a.m. and went until about 1 p.m. Students re-ceived free Papa John’s pizza and 
drinks while vendors gave out free 
shirts, bags, candy, cup holders, water bottles and more. The table for University Hous-
ing Apartments had students play a beer-pong reminiscent game, mi-nus the beer, with each cup worth a specific prize.
 One student won an iPod 
nano. 
At The Estates, Royal Village 
and University Club Apartments 
table, students tossed a football to 
win either a t-shirt or backpack. Vendors also offered students spe-cial deals for deciding to sign an 
early lease or visit the apartment 
complexes. 
“There’s a lot of options here 
but they don’t really 
say enough for you 
to make a decision,” said freshman An Ho. 
“But the free stuff is really good.”
While the majority of booths 
were targeting those looking for  off-campus housing, representa-tives for the UF Department of Housing were also on hand to pro-
vide students with options about 
on-campus living.
“You can’t get any closer to 
campus life than living right here,” said Dawn Sayer, a member of the Residence Life staff.Local apartment reps

Vegans and vegetarians will be 
delighted with the new “Meat-Free 
Mondays” campaign at Gator Din-
ing locations. 
Starting Nov. 8, Gator Corner 
Dining and Fresh Food Company will provide a variety of vegan 
meal options Mondays as part of 
a nationwide campaign to educate students on the environmental and health impacts of meat consump-
tion.
“There’s a lot of links between 
heavy meat consumption, heart dis-
ease and other things,” said Dana Falstad, sustainability manager for 
Aramark, Gator Dining’s food ser -
vice provider.
Falstad also stated that the car -
bon footprint of meat consumption is much higher than that of vegeta-
bles, due to its high energy intake. 
Thirty other universities across the nation have joined the cam-paign, which has been publicly en-dorsed by Meatless Monday, a non-
profit organization that works to 
promote meat-free eating, as well as GatorWell, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals and Gators 
for a Sustainable Campus.
While the dining halls will still 
serve meat Mondays, students will have the option to have meals pre-
pared without it. There will also be a vegan breakfast option available. 
For Monday, the dining hall 
menu includes tofu salad, Mediter -
ranean pasta and vegetarian pizza.
Over the next few weeks, Ara-
mark and Gator Dining Services plan to expand the campaign to in-
clude the Home Zone and Orange 
& Brew at the Reitz Union as well as the Racquet Club Dining Hall, with a vegetarian menu on request 
at each location.Campus dining halls

Medics treat a wounded boy after a bombing in the Shiite neighborhood of Sadr City in Baghdad, Iraq 
on Tuesday. 
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
BAGHDAD — Rapid-fire 
bombings and mortar strikes 
killed 76 people and wounded more than 200 across Baghdad’s myriad neighborhoods Tuesday, demonstrating the insurgents’ ability to carry out coordinated strikes from one side of the capi-tal to the other.
The attack — blasts in at least 
13 separate neighborhoods — was clearly designed to hit ci-vilians at restaurants and cafes where many Iraqis were gathered to enjoy the warm evening. The sophistication and the targets — Shiites — suggested that al-Qai-da-linked Sunni militants were responsible for the deadliest day in Iraq since May.
The strikes, two days after 
the bloody siege of a downtown church, were stunning in their scope — indicating a high degree of coordination and complex-ity from an insurgency that just a few months ago U.S. and Iraqi officials were saying was all but defeated.
“They say the situation is un-
der the control. Where is their control?” said Hussein al-Saiedi, a 26-year-old resident of Bagh-
dad’s sprawling Sadr City slum, 
where 21 people were killed 
when a parked car blew up near 
a market in Tuesday’s deadliest 
bombing.
“We were just standing on 
the street when we heard a loud 
noise, and then saw smoke and 
pieces of cars, falling from the sky,” al-Saiedi said. People were fleeing the site in panic, franti-cally calling the names of their relatives and friends.”
The bombings began at about 
6:15 p.m. and lasted for hours. 
The assailants used booby-trapped cars and a motorcycle, road-
side bombs and mortars. Though 10 neighborhoods targeted were home to mostly Shiites, a couple of strikes hit Sunni communities as well.
In addition to the 76 dead, 232 
people were wounded, according to police and hospital officials who spoke on condition of ano-nymity because they were not au-thorized to speak to the media.
Prime Minister Nouri al-Mali-
ki called the string of blasts and the church siege crimes by terror -ists and former members of the Baath Party — which once ruled Iraq under Saddam Hussein — against innocent civilians de-signed to provoke sectarian strife and destablize the government.
“The criminal acts that tar -
geted the Christians at the Lady of Salvation church and the ci-vilians in Baghdad are political blasts intending to halt the form-ing of the government,” he said in a statement. Iraq has been without a new government since the March 7 elections, leaving a political vacuum that many fear insurgents are trying to exploit.
The White House condemned 
the “vicious violence” and of-fered sympathy to the victims’ families and all Iraqis.
“We have confidence that the 
people of Iraq will remain stead-fast in their rejection of efforts by extremists to spark sectarian tension,” said National Security Council spokesman Mike Ham-mer. “These attacks will not stop Iraq’s progress. The United States stands with the people of Iraq and remains committed to our strong and long-term partnership.”
There was no immediate claim 
of responsibility, but suspicion fell on al-Qaida.
“We do not have any conclu-
sive information at this time as to the responsible parties but this seems to be typical AQI (al-Qaida in Iraq) tactics,” said Lt. Col. Eric Bloom, a U.S. military spokes-man.

Today’s question: Are you happy 
with the results of Tuesday’s elections?
106 TOTAL VOTES76% YES24% NOTuesday’s question: Are you going to vote?Tea Partiers are sipping on Kool-Aid
Congratulations to the 112th United States Congress and the new governor of the great state of Florida. 
By the time this is printed, we should know 
who most of you are. For those of you who kept us up all night, thanks a lot. Wait, who am I kidding? The percent-age of students at UF who stayed up late on election night is surely less than 5 percent, right? And only a bit more will actually vote in the midterms despite the virtuous ef-forts of local political organizations, campaigns and in-dependent groups like Rock the Vote. More students are interested in the end of attack ads between Steve Oelrich 
and Perry McGriff or between Alex Sink and Rick Scott 
than to actually help decide which one of them will be 
governing all of us.
Maybe I’m weird, but I was incredibly excited to vote 
in this election as it was my first since turning 18. Further -
more, I consider myself a center-left kind of guy, so based 
on the political climate this year, “excited” isn’t a word 
that comes to most of my like-minded colleagues’ minds when thinking about a midterm election that was sched-uled to dissipate the Democratic party’s supermajority.
But just wait, Republicans, here’s some advice you 
could have used. Republicans, you shot yourselves in the foot with candidates like Christine O’Donnell, whose largest claim to fame was witchcraft, and Sharron Angle, who makes last year’s incarnation of Joaquin Phoenix look like a media darling.
It’s my personal belief this is not a mandate against the 
Obama Administration. The chief issue behind this past election is, yet again, the economy. After the stimulus package in 2009 and the official end of the recession back in June, consumers just still aren’t confident.
The Republicans need to be careful, however. The Tea 
Party might surge to power based on two major issues: cutting government spending and lowering taxes, but most Tea Par -
tiers are more socially conservative than the average bear as well. I find it hard to believe the Tea Party is a sustainable national movement. It works well on a local, grassroots level, where candidates can go head-to-head against that “Wash-
ington politician” or that “Tallahassee politician” who foolishly spent taxpayer money. But when Tea Partiers go 
national, you end up with O’Donnell, Angle, Sarah Palin 
and Michele Bachmann. Not only are all four of these can-
didates gaffe-prone, but their election into national office, God forbid the office of the president of the U.S., could result in turmoil both here and abroad.
Why’s that? The Tea Party stems out of legitimate con-
cern and a legitimate political perspective, one I don’t subscribe to, but not an unreasonable political view. However, it’s the supporters who often throw their own movement under the bus. Either by displaying signs with racial slurs, Photoshopping the president of the U.S. with a Hitler mustache or screaming socialism in an attempt to be the anti-vanguard, the movement loses credibility daily. 
So a few congratulations are in order. Pop that cham-
pagne, Republicans.  Don’t adjust your television, Speak-er John Boehner is really that orange (Watch out Snooki!) and get ready for the sprint to the center. Democrats, know that Obama has to compromise if he wants to be re-elected, but Republicans should know that Tea Partiers aren’t a shoo-in either.
Sean Quinn is a first-year political science student. His 
column appears every Wednesday. Fat chance
The Brits have a big problem. In fact, they have an extra-extra-
extra-extra-large problem to wrap their minds and belts around. 
The British retailer High 
& Mighty has just introduced the country’s biggest no-spe-cial-order-required suit, an XXXXL frock intended for a 60-inch waist. 
And, by the way, 60 inch-
es is five feet when not using that all-too-easy metric sys-tem everyone else seems to love. A 60-inch waist equates 
to a height where children 
are deemed too short to ride many roller coasters.
And when we have peo-
ple with waistlines longer than a fifth-grade kid, we’ve got a problem. 
At a time when, across the 
pond, obesity puts a $78 bil-lion price tag on America’s health care, and when Mis-sissippi, the longtime holder of the dubious title of the fattest state in the union, has an obesity rate of more than one in three people, we have a problem.
Back to the English High 
& Mighty problem, which we can only assume does not bode well for the mak-ers of the whitey tighties, recent studies suggest one in five British men has a waist larger than 38 inches. 
While we haven’t seen 
any marketable XXXXS suits, 
we wonder if stores like High 
& Mighty are actively fight-ing the obesity pandemic or encouraging it by making a 60-inch-waistline suit. 
Regardless of the answer, 
we have a serious multi-billion dollar problem on our grease-laden, Cheetos-stained hands.Shock the vote
Florida’s 2000 recount 
shock has taught us little
Florida’s embarrassment 10 years ago hasn’t taught us much.
With every election, there comes an equal and labo-
rious series of voting mishaps that continue to plague our 
great democracy.
By Tuesday afternoon, reports of electronic voting ma-
chines, supposedly the most accurate, inaccurately recording 
votes were already reported. 
And reports of such inaccuracies were apparently plagu-
ing the Silver State as multiple reports began to flood across 
Nevada.
Voters across the state, who we can only assume were try-
ing to bare their tea-party teeth one last time, reported large discrepancies with the electronic voting machines already voting for Democratic Sen. Harry Reid. 
Swaths of North Carolina voters reported computers inac-
curately recorded votes for the entirely wrong political party. 
And some supervisors of elections in Pennsylvania have 
thrown out hundreds of ballots because of reported signa-ture problems.
You’d think after Florida’s 36-day recount debacle that 
threw “hanging chad” and Pat Buchanan into our popular 
lexicon and left the nation hanging in the balance would 
have taught the country a few lessons. 
Inevitably, by tonight there will be recounts demanded 
and more voting issues reported to spur even more result challenges. 
And when recounts happen in states that throw out bal-
lots because of “signature problems,” we’ve learned nothing from Florida’s recount embarrassment.

Media’s credibility falling
Mediocre journalism does more harm than 
good. 
Tuesday’s article on Google’s autonomous ve-
hicles is the example I will pick on, but I mean no 
disrespect to either the writer of the piece or those 
interviewed. 
First, the interviewees were not qualified to give 
valuable insight on the issue. Why not interview an 
on-campus expert such as Carl Crane of CIMAR, 
who has been working with autonomous vehicles 
for years? 
The interviewee selection in this article in spe-
cific is similar to asking a cosmetic surgeon and a 
medical student for insight on an experimental can-
cer treatment.
 The interviewees may be good at what they do, 
but they are not qualified to speak about other top-ics.
While it might be true that a professor and a stu-
dent both expressed concerns about the Google ve-hicle, the plural voice of skepticism indicated in the subtitle is inaccurate and harmful. 
This gives the public the impression there should 
be concern about these vehicles, thus hampering any chance for safer roads. Journalism should be treated more like science where results can be veri-fied and repeated. 
In other words, articles need to have better sam-
pling, less bias and a bit of critical thinking in their design.
Seeing this every day, I am quite disappointed 
with the media.
 For better or worse, the media have a lot of in-
fluence on popular opinion. 
We would be better off if the voice of the media 
took a logical approach to informing us instead of presenting random blathering to fill space and meet 
deadlines.

The release of nearly 400,000 confidential Iraq war docu-
ments on Oct. 22 by the WikiLeaks website revealed a startling image of the secret history of the war in Iraq.
The documents contain details of events reported by the 
United States military and provide evidence of systematic tor -
ture and rape used as weapons of warfare. Sixty percent of the deaths registered in the documents are civilians.
The documents reveal the use of indiscriminate and dis-
proportionate force used and condoned by the US military. They also raise substantial questions concerning war crimes. This leak has been the largest release of classified military documents in history.
Critics argue the release of this sensitive information will 
jeopardize US military operations and be used by opposition forces to seek out and kill Iraqi civilian informants working with the US military.
Supporters of the whistleblower website contend the 
documents contain information the public deserves to know. According to the documents, as many as 15,000 Iraqi civilian deaths were previously unaccounted for.
When President Obama was elected, he promised to con-
duct his administration with transparency. The amount of se-crets revealed within the documents WikiLeaks released flies in the face of such promises. Obama’s promise for transpar -
ency has gone the way of his promise to close Guantanamo Bay.
To be fair, the files document the Iraq war during a time 
Obama was not president, but that doesn’t excuse him from failing to hold the Bush administration accountable.
Secrets and lies are what paraded the U.S. into the war in 
Iraq. The WikiLeaks files reveal that secrets and lies have only prolonged that war.
It is difficult to justify a war waged under false pretenses. It is also tough to support a war effort that tolerates torture and civilian mur -
der and gives private contractors free reign.
Julian Assange is the spokesperson 
and editor-in-chief for the WikiLeaks website. As would be expected, he is receiving a great deal of flak for releasing the Iraq documents. News organizations are wondering why he isn’t dead yet and claiming that the U.S. government should list him as an enemy combatant, which would deprive him of the right to due process.
This doesn’t seem right. Shouldn’t he be considered a 
champion of truth and democracy? Don’t the people have a right to know about the sort of devastation and destruction that is happening in their name, with their tax dollars?
The WikiLeaks files are important for the historical re-
cord as primary documentation of the many mishandlings of a complicated war. It appears the media is more concerned with attacking Julian Assange than with discussing the issue of human rights the documents raise.
In 1971, Daniel Ellsberg, a former Rand Corporation em-
ployee, released Department of Defense documents that de-tailed the United States political-military involvement in Viet-nam from 1945 to 1967. 
The documents became known as the Pentagon Papers 
and indicated, among other things, that the Johnson adminis-tration had systematically lied to the public and to Congress. 
The publication of the papers caused a national outcry for 
government transparency and accountability.
Today, the socio-political landscape is much different. 
Many major media outlets have expressed their disgust over the release of the WikiLeaks documents.
On the other hand, some media sources commend the website for its courage and goodwill comment of being un-surprised by the lack of government honesty. 
There is no palpable call to action or demand for account-
ability.
 Instead the politically discontent shrug their shoulders 
and brush off the failure of military responsibility.
Wikileaks is trying to pull the wool out of the eyes of a 
world that prefers to live in the dark.
An Army whistleblower, Spc. Bradley Manning, is cur -
rently in custody. He is suspected for leaking thousands of Iraq war documents to WikiLeaks. 
The Obama administration has brought as many prosecu-
tions for leaks to the American public as all previous admin-istrations combined. Granted, it is a small number — three — but it is still important to note.
The administration is also threatening to use the Espio-
nage Act to prevent further leaks. If that happens, the Ameri-can public will know even less about the destruction that is happening in their name.
This past summer, WikiLeaks released over 70,000 docu-
ments relating to the Afghanistan war. 
The same national security concerns were raised at the 
time. But the Associated Press recently obtained a pentagon letter stating that no US intelligence services or practices were damaged after the release of the documents.
For a democracy to function as a true democracy the 
governing body must live up to the public’s expectation of transparency and accountability. WikiLeaks is providing in-formation that the United States government was expected, but failed, to provide. The Iraq documents establish firmer ground for dissidents to stand upon in denouncing this de-spairingly unjust war.

CORAL GABLES (AP) — Tea party favorite 
Marco Rubio capped his dramatic rise with an 
easy win Tuesday over Gov . Charlie Crist and U.S. Rep. Kendrick Meek in the race for Florida’s open Senate seat, keeping it with the GOP .
With 78 percent of precincts reporting, Rubio 
had about 50 percent of the vote, to 29 percent for Crist, who left the Republican Party earlier this year to run as an independent when polls showed him trailing in a GOP primary. Democratic nomi-
nee Meek had 19.6 percent.
“We make a great mistake if we believe that 
tonight these results are somehow an embrace of 
the Republican party,” Rubio told supporters at a rally, referring to his and other GOP wins around the country. “What they are is a second chance, a second chance for Republicans to be what they said they were going to be not so long ago.”Rubio, a former speaker of the Florida House, 
was given little chance to defeat Crist when he 
announced his candidacy last year. Rubio will re-
place George LeMieux, who was appointed to the seat last year after Mel Martinez resigned.
Moments before the race was called, former 
Gov. Jeb Bush walked into the room where Ru-bio was watching returns and said, “Congratula-tions!”
“Why? Do you guys know something we 
don’t?” Rubio replied. When news agencies de-
clared him the winner, the room erupted with 
roars. Rubio kept looking at the television and joked. “C’mon! I’m trying to hear about Ken-tucky!”
Bush said he supported Rubio from the begin-
ning.
“I’m so proud of him and he ran a spectacular 
race. “It’s a great day for the conservative cause. New people with new thinking, new ideas — 21st 
century solutions.”
Rubio built momentum through tea party ral-
lies, driving around the state on a tight budget 
and often without staff to talk to any conserva-tive group that would listen. His message was consistent: President Barack Obama’s domestic spending and health care policies are a disaster and the nation will spiral downward if spending isn’t controlled.
“When you’re 35 points down in the polls and 
the only people who think you can win live in 
your house, and four of them are under the age 
of 10, you better know why your running,” Rubio said in his victory speech.
Party leaders in Tallahassee and Washington 
tried to force him out of the race so then-Repub-lican Crist could walk to the nomination. But Ru-bio believed Crist wasn’t a principled conserva-
tive and used the image of the governor hugging 
Obama at a rally to push for the $787 billion stim-ulus package to whittle away at Crist’s support.
For months, Crist acted as if he were the only 
candidate in the race. Then Rubio’s fundraising and poll numbers increased to the point that Crist was the underdog. Meanwhile, Meek struggled to gain traction as the media focused on the intense battle for the Republican nomination.8, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 3, 2010

THAN 10,000 VOTES.
BY C.J. Pruner
Alligator Staff Writer
Keeping in lockstep with the wave of 
Republican revival that swept elections 
across the nation and state, local Demo-crats seeking office took a beating at the 
polls Tuesday. 
In a District 14 Florida State Senate 
race marked with heated political ex-
change, Republican incumbent Steve Oel-
rich carried the conservative momentum, 
defeating Democratic challenger Perry C. McGriff Jr. by more than 10,000 votes. 
Addressing a crowd of support-
ers at the Hampton Inn in downtown 
Gainesville to watch election results, 
a disappointed McGriff attempted to  make peace with the defeat while thank-ing campaign staff and supporters for 
their effort. 
Although he acknowledged a sense of 
hurt at some of Oelrich’s campaign ads, 
especially one regarding McGriff’s posi-tion on adoption, McGriff said that he 
gave Oelrich a congratulatory call that 
was “short and to the point” and told supporters that he would continue to be involved in public service.
“The Lord has wrapped his arms 
around me so I’ll be OK,” he said. “Life will go on.”
The race for County Commission Dis-
trict 4 produced one of the more surpris-
ing results of the night as Democratic 
candidate Cynthia Chestnut was defeat-ed by Republican Susan Baird by more than 5,000 votes. 
But it wasn’t all gloom for Democrats 
locally, as Lee Pinkoson won his contest for a seat on the County Commission Dis-trict 2. He defeated the Republican can-didate, Jim Gabriel, by a margin of more 
than 8,000 votes.
Jon Reiskind, the chairman of the Ala-
chua County Democratic Party Executive 
Committee, said that while a Republican backlash was to be expected, the results 
still served as a disappointment for a 
party that, he believes, needs to recon-nect with the public in order to improve from its midterm showing. 
Although Reiskind acknowledged 
that Democrats have their work cut out for them between now and the next elec-tion, he remains optimistic that the party can recover.
“It’s a sad day for the Democrats but 
it’s not a tragic day,” he said.Republicans take local seats, mirror state

For 37 years, the pepper-haired man with the oval specta-
cles has been cutting Gators’ hair. Because of tough times – or 
maybe in spite of them – Jay Jarrell, 59, moved his Reitz Union Barber Shop to a smaller space about the size of his old waiting area. Before the move, he said, he was barely treading water.
“The last ten years have been a real struggle to break even,” 
he said.
He anticipates the new space, which opened Monday, will 
be better for business. 
He’d been asking the Reitz Union management for a small-
er place for some time, and when the old Freshens spot opened up, he jumped on it. The space is smaller than he would’ve liked, but “you can’t pick and choose space like that in a build-ing like this.”
Jarrell has significant ties to the Gator nation. He gradu-
ated with a degree in psychology , his son and daughter were 
Gators and his parents were season ticket holders. He hopes 
that his grandchildren will attend UF as well.
He likes cutting students’ hair because they’re bright and 
have a clear way of communicating what they want.
He’s been a barber for a long time, and his job provides him 
with the means to live, but what he does doesn’t define him or his happiness.
“Some people say you have to love what you do to be a happy person, but I’m just not convinced,” he said.
For him, the simple things are enough. He loves his church 
and his hobbies. The first haircut he gave in the new space was to his 8-month-old grandson.
His dad always told him that as a barber he may not always 
have steak, but he’d always have hamburger.
He wants to cut his hours when he turns 67. Sometimes he’s on his feet for 10 hours a day, and he knows he can’t work like that forever. For now, he’s enjoying the smaller workload of the new space and the financial ease – the rent is $375 now, $1,525 less than before.
“If I’m blessed enough to be in good health, I’d work until 
I’m 72 or so,” he said, “at which time I’d like to be able to shoot my age in golf.”WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 3, 2010 � ALLIGATOR, 9

UF coach Billy Donovan is expected to use centers Vernon Macklin (above) and 
Patric Young together tonight.
By GREG LUCA
Alligator Staff Writer
gluca@alligator.org
 
After playing with what he called a 6-1/2-
man rotation last year, coach Billy Donovan 
has to be salivating over the lineup combina-tions available to him this season.
For the first time since the departure of 
the heralded ‘04s, the Gators’ coach believes he will be able to use both larger and smaller variations of his starting five. 
No. 11 Florida will put a few of those group-
ings on display tonight at 7 in the O’Connell Center when it squares off against George-town (Ky.) College in its second and final ex-hibition game. 
After experimenting with numerous line-
ups in Florida’s opener and limiting seniors Alex Tyus and Vernon Macklin to just 10 and 12 minutes, respectively. Donovan said he will return to more traditional looks in tonight’s matchup. 
“My No. 1 goal going into the (Florida 
Tech) game was to try to get enough minutes for all the freshman,” Donovan said. “So the 
lineups we had out there a lot of times were 
maybe lineups that we wouldn’t have neces-sarily in a lot of regular-season games.”
This could mean more action for Florida’s 
starting five, which only saw about six min-utes of playing time against Florida Tech. 
Also likely to see more minutes is a larger 
lineup that includes freshman Patric Young and senior Vernon Macklin. 
Donovan first tinkered with playing the 
two former McDonald’s All-Americans to-gether in team practices and scrimmages, and the unit yielded encouraging results. 
“I think it’s a good look,” senior Chandler 
Parsons said. “It’s different and I think it’s just another lineup we can throw out there with the pieces that we have.” 
The duo played together for 2:52 of the 
team’s exhibition opener, a stretch when the Gators were outscored 11-5. Macklin and Young combined for 0 points 
and 0 rebounds in the initial test run. But their mere presence generated a trio of long-range shooting opportunities for the Gators, as the Panthers were forced to divert their defensive attention to the interior. 
“That’s something that we gotta continue 
to work on in practice,” Donovan said. 
At the Southeastern Conference’s media 
day, Donovan remarked that the two “kinda 
got in each other’s way,” as each is accustomed 
to playing center and controlling the paint. 
The configuration requires Macklin to shift 
from his traditional role out to the power for -
ward position, where he is learning new re-sponsibilities like taking the ball out and play-ing at the top of the press. 
Even if the unit is eventually scrapped, se-
nior Alex Tyus and the remaining Gators will 
have benefitted from working against it in 
practice. 
“It was just like a regular SEC game,” Tyus 
said. “Pat plays real physical, and Vern’s a great player.”
Another lineup the Gators have experi-
mented with uses guards Kenny Boynton, Er -
ving Walker and Scottie Wilbekin simultane-ously, although practice as a trio has been put 
on hold due to Wilbekin’s neck strain. 
The only time the alignment was actually 
featured was in an intrasquad scrimmage, 
where it received positive reviews. 
“It was fun,” Boynton said. “Our team was 
very intense. We got a lot of steals and basi-cally for the time that we were in we were a speed team.”Donovan to test tall lineup in exhibition game

Film session was a sobering experi-
ence for Jon Halapio just days after Flor -
ida took on Miami (Ohio) in the season 
opener.
The redshirt freshman guard was 
routinely beat and looked lost at times 
against what should have been an over -
matched RedHawks defensive line. 
“After the first game I was horrible. I was disgusted with myself,” Halapio 
said. “I can’t believe I was on the field playing like that. I promised myself 
that it wouldn’t happen again.”
Halapio graded out a 
55 percent by his coaches 
— using a formula no one 
outside of the UF football 
team is familiar with, but it’s safe to say a 55 is a failing grade whether he was being graded on pass blocking or chemistry. Halapio rebounds from 
slow start, injuriesEight games in, we still don’t really 
know the UF offense.
Sure, fans were ready to write 
the unit off before last week. Fire the of-fensive coordinator. Bench the quarter -
back. Promote verbal commit Jeff Driskel 
from Hagerty High like a Triple-A relief 
pitcher.
Then the Gators rolled up to Jackson-
ville and brought some Outdoor-Cocktail-
Party fun with them. UF used a flashy 
two-quarterbacks-on-one-field system 
and even went no huddle.
Florida’s offense gained 450 yards, its second-best out-
put of the season 
(and best against a team not named 
Kentucky). The 
Gators even scored on a 91-yard drive, 
its  longest of the 
year. 
But as much as 
the offense teased 
fans with long-overdue bright spots, the Gators still needed their defense to light UF needs heavy dose of turnovers“I think it’s a good look. It’s different 
and I think it’s just another lineup 
we can throw out there with the 
pieces that we have.”

Guard Jon Halapio (67) missed UF’s Oct. 16 loss to Mississippi State due to a broken 
finger on his right hand.
up the scoreboard Saturday . Including Will “The (occasional) 
Thrill” Hill’s overtime interception, half of Florida’s points 
were preceded by turnovers in its 34-31 win against Georgia.
And that’s been the theme all season. Florida leads the 
SEC with 93 points off turnovers this year. Auburn ranks sec-
ond with 90 points, and the other 10 teams are averaging 41.5 points off interceptions and fumbles.
At first glance, the War Eagle/Tigers/Raging Cam New-
tons seem comparable to Florida in the area. But, leading the 
conference with 40 points per game, Auburn does not rely on 
turnovers nearly as much as Florida. 
To understand just how hard the Gators lean on turnovers, 
consider this: 41 percent of the team’s points come after de-fensive takeaways. For the 11 SEC teams not named Florida, about 20 percent of their points fall under the same category.
About one-quarter of Auburn’s points come off turnovers.In UF’s five wins, the Gators sport a plus-11 turnover mar -
gin. In its three losses? Minus-six. That, of course, is not sur -
prising. In the three hours a day producers release him from his cage, even ESPN’s Skip Bayless could tell you turning the 
ball over is very bad.
But how comfortable do you feel about your team if it’s 
identity revolves around forcing turnovers? Some chalk take-
aways up to right-place, right-time, good-bounce-of-the-ball 
luck.
But a talented defense will get its hands on the ball more 
than a mediocre one, and Florida’s been able to force turnovers because of the skill of its defensive backs. The Gators are tied 
for first nationally with 16 interceptions, while the team ranks 
113th with just three forced fumbles. 
Janoris Jenkins’ interception on the first play of Saturday’s game, when he jumped an A.J. Green hitch route, came because 
Jenkins has good instincts and can quickly change direction.
Theoretically, though, a team is going to force a lot of turn-
overs by dominating up front. But the Gators rank 66th with 15 sacks this season, so opposing quarterbacks aren’t making bad decisions because they’re under pressure.
And Florida has, on occasion, been lucky . Urban Meyer 
won’t factor luck into the game because that implies parts of 
his job can’t be controlled through hard work. It’s understand-
able logic, but that doesn’t mean its true.
Both of The Thrill’s interceptions came when tipped passes 
sailed right to him. He even said after the game that his over -
time interception fell right in his lap.
Again, not every interception or forced fumble is blind luck. 
Most aren’t. But some are.
And the Gators might need a few opportunities to fall in 
their lap if they want the rest of the season to be memorable.TYLER , from page 14
SEC FOOTBALL
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS  
STARKVILLE, Miss. — Mississippi 
State defensive end Nick Bell died Tues-
day at the University of Alabama-Bir -
mingham Hospital after a short battle 
with cancer.
Bell, a 20-year-old from Bessemer, 
Ala., was diagnosed in late September 
after experiencing headaches during 
football practice and had surgery on Oct. 1 to remove a mass from his brain. He had emergency surgery on Monday 
morning after it was found that the can-
cer had aggressively spread throughout his body.
“Nick was a son and he was a broth-
er to everyone in this football family ,” 
a somber Mississippi State coach Dan 
Mullen said Tuesday night. “I know he’s looking down on us right now and I’m sure he’s already been picked for a team 
up in heaven to play football again — 
the game that he loved.”
Mullen held a team meeting on 
Tuesday afternoon, where he informed the players Bell had died. The Bulldogs 
went ahead with their regularly sched-
uled practice. School officials said coun-selors were available for students and staff, and practice wasn’t mandatory.
“That’s a sanctuary for our coaches, 
our players and our football family to be out there together doing the thing we love most,” Mullen said. “It kind of felt good to sweat out some of the feelings and emotions that were inside.”
After Bell’s initial surgery on Oct. 1, 
there was optimism about his recovery . 
He returned to cam-pus on Oct. 23 and 
visited teammates on 
the sideline during 
the Bulldogs’ victory over Alabama-Bir -
mingham.
But his condition 
deteriorated quickly 
over the past week, and he was rushed to the hospital on Sunday.
About 50 Mississippi State players 
and coaches visited Bell and his family at UAB Hospital on Monday evening.
“We grabbed a bus and loaded up a 
bunch of guys,” Mullen said. “I think it’s 
great that a lot of our players got to go 
over there, see the situation and get to say their goodbyes.”Bell loses fight with cancerMcCarney denies coaching rumors
A rash of injuries to the offensive line 
kept Halapio in the rotation, regardless of his struggles, and he vowed to put that per -
formance behind him.
Eight weeks later, Halapio is garnering 
praise from both head coach Urban Meyer 
and offensive line coach Steve Addazio for his contributions to the team. 
“Remember that name,” Meyer said 
after Halapio graded out a champion this 
week against Georgia. 
Halapio worked on cleaning up his tech-
nique, and the game started to become less of a foreign language to him as he got more and more snaps under his belt. 
In film sessions, he sits behind senior 
Mike Pouncey, who earned All-American honors at Halapio’s right guard position last season, and picks the senior’s brain on how to improve his game. 
“I try to watch Mike Pouncey on ev-
ery single play because he’s just a natural baller,” Halapio said. “I love watching him and I want to follow his footsteps and I want to be just like him because he prac-
tices hard and he plays hard.”
Halapio said one of the toughest parts 
of college football for him has been playing through injuries, something he wasn’t able 
to do against Mississippi State. He was held out of the loss to the Bulldogs after under -
going surgery on a finger on his right hand, 
which sustained a break the previous week 
against LSU. 
“I almost passed out when I looked at it 
because my bone was sticking out,” Hala-
pio said. “It’s probably the worst pain I’ve 
ever felt.”
But Halapio will gladly take a few more 
bumps and bruises as long as he doesn’t have to endure the pain of watching anoth-
er performance like Week 1 on video. 
McCarney hasn’t heard from Minneso-
ta: UF defensive line coach Dan McCarney, 
who was the head coach at Iowa State from 1995-2006, has been rumored as a candidate for the head coaching vacancy at Minne-
sota. But McCarney said Tuesday that he 
hasn’t had any contact with the program.

MIAMI — Edwin Rodriguez will get to 
start what he finished — a season as manager 
of the Florida Marlins.
After considering other candidates, the 
Marlins decided to keep Rodriguez, a per -
son familiar with the search said Tuesday . The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the Marlins weren’t planning an announcement until Wednesday.
Rodriguez became the first Puerto Rican 
manager in the major leagues when he took over as interim manager June 23 after Fredi 
Gonzalez was fired. Rodriguez, who has 
been in baseball 30 years, managed Florida’s Triple-A team in New Orleans before getting his first big league job.
Rodriguez was popular with players and 
won praise for his handling of All-Star short-stop Hanley Ramirez, whose attitude became an issue after he was benched by Gonzalez for not hustling early last season.
Gonzalez was dismissed with Florida at 
34-36 and in fourth place in the NL East. Ro-driguez went 46-46, and the Marlins finished third.Gonzalez was hired last month to replace 
the retiring Bobby Cox as manager of the At-lanta Braves. The Marlins’ decision to keep Rodriguez was first reported by the South Florida Sun Sentinel on its website.
There has been speculation that owner Jef-
frey Loria might want a high-profile manager 
when the team moves into its new ballpark 
in 2012.
But president of baseball operations Larry 
Beinfest hinted last month that Rodriguez 
might be the right match for the team’s perennially young roster.
“This job is a unique job,” 
Beinfest said then. “It’s a little 
bit of a manager who can grow with the team, get the most out of them, develop them and create a winning culture.”
While the Marlins are young, they believe 
they’re on the verge of playoff contention. On the final day of the regular season, Rodriguez said he had high expectations for next year.
“This organization is in very good shape,” 
he said. “I can picture this organization being 
in a pennant race next year, and obviously for 
2012, when we move into the new ballpark, hopefully we should be in the World Series.”Marlins stick with Rodriguez
“I almost passed out when I 
looked at it because my bone was 
sticking out.”

 FLORIDA WILL TAKE ON 
VANDERBILT TONIGHT AT 6.
By JESSE SIMONTON
Alligator Writer
 
Fresh off its fifth consecutive 
regular-season Southeastern Con-
ference Championship, No. 7 Flor -
ida enters the SEC Tournament to-
night as a confident team hungry for the taste of another title.
Despite their recent regular-
season successes, the Gators haven’t won a conference tour -
nament since 2007. Tonight’s tilt against Vanderbilt is Florida’s first chance to erase the two-year drought. 
“Our team is taking a lot of 
pride in winning [the tournament] because they realize this is a really good setting to practice for next 
week’s [NCAA Tournament] one-
and-done scenario,” coach Becky Burleigh said. 
The Gators (15-2-2, 9-1-1 SEC) 
kick off the tournament tonight in 
Orange Beach, Ala., at 6 against 
the Commodores (8-9-2, 4-5-2 SEC) sporting multiple five-game winning streaks. Florida has won 
its last five regular-season games, 
and it has won all five meetings against Vanderbilt in the confer -ence tournament’s history.  Flori-da has outscored Vanderbilt 16-3 
in those contests. 
Earlier this season, the Gators 
dominated the Commodores in a 
2-0 victory in Nashville,Tenn., but 
Burleigh expects a different team 
this time.
“They didn’t have their leading 
scorer,” she said. “Playing a team for the second time is really hard. 
Teams make adjustments and it 
becomes a sort of cat-and-mouse game the second time around.”
Although Vanderbilt enters the 
tournament as the lowest seed, Florida isn’t taking any chances and is approaching the match with the mindset of just one game at a time, senior Kat Williamson said.
While the Gators eyes are 
honed in on the ultimate goal, they know that the Commodores need to win the tournament just to 
qualify for the NCAAs.
“Teams are willing to throw 
different looks,” Burleigh said. “I 
expect them to come our firing. Desperate times call for desperate 
measures.”
Williamson named 2010 SEC 
Defensive Player of the Year:  
Quietly, the Gators’ most consis-tent player this season has been 
the rock on the back line. William-son was rewarded for her solid play Tuesday.
The SEC announced its 2010 
All-Conference teams and indi-vidual award winners, and de-spite several Gators players re-ceiving recognition, Williamson 
received the highest praise: being 
named the SEC Defensive Player of the Year.
Often overlooked because of 
Florida’s high-powered offense, 
Williamson, a sophomore, has 
started every game the past two seasons and has filled in valiantly for last year’s SEC Defensive Play-
er of the Year, Lauren Hyde. 
“She’s done an amazing job,” 
keeper Katie Fraine said. “She’s 
such an intense player and is one that shows that heart is more im-
portant than size.”
Despite being 5-foot-6, Wil-
liamson is described as a warrior 
by teammates, and a player the 
Gators rely on to win games. 
“She’s the most physical and 
aggressive player on our team,” 
Fraine said. “She refuses to lose. Her competitiveness is what 
makes her so good.”Williamson was the only re-
turning starter from the back line 
a year ago, but the first team All-SEC player led the way meshing the group into a fearsome four -
some. 
“It’s something we’ve had to 
work on throughout the year,” Williamson said. “But I think 
we’ve kind of figured it out.”
“She’s done a terrific job,” Bur -
leigh said. “She’s super competi-
tive, and she really makes up for a lot of our mistakes.”
Burleigh, others also honored:  
While Williamson was named the Defensive Player of the Year, sev-eral other Gators, including Bur -
leigh, picked up accolades Tues-day.
Burleigh was named the 2010 
SEC Coach of the Year, the fourth time she’s been honored with the 
award. Florida’s coach has led the 
team since its inaugural season in 1995, guiding the Gators to 11 SEC titles and one national champion-
ship.
Five Gators were named to the 
2010 All-SEC teams including for -
ward Taylor Travis, who picked 
up several awards, most notably 
being named 2010 SEC Freshman 
of the Year. 
The North Carolina native is 
second in the SEC with 10 assists, 
and was also named to the All-
SEC Freshman team and to the All-SEC second team. Also on the second team was forward Tahnai Annis, who is second in the SEC 
in points and goals.
Ashlee Elliott, Erika Tymrak 
and Williamson were all named 
to the All-SEC first team. It was 
the third time Elliott has received 
such an award, the first since her transition to center back. 16, ALLIGATOR  WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 3, 2010
