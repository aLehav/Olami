MACUNGIE, Pa. (AP) — A veterinarian said a dog 
trapped in a car on a 90-degree day in Pennsylvania honked 
the horn until he was rescued. Nancy Soares said the choco-late Labrador was brought to her animal hospital last month after he had been in the car for about an hour.
She said Max’s owner had gone shopping and was un-
loading packages when she returned but forgot that Max was still in the car. She later heard the horn honking and looked outside several times but saw nothing amiss. Finally, she went outside and saw Max sitting in the driver’s seat, honking the horn. Max suffered no serious injuries.

George Steinbrenner was known in the 
sports world for his deep pockets. 
The famed baseball owner, who died 
of a heart attack at age 80 on Tuesday, 
brought his New York Yankees to seven World Series titles and 11 World Series ap-pearances. 
While he was known nationwide for 
generous spending on his baseball team, Steinbrenner was also a generous donor to UF.
The Steinbrenner Band Hall, which 
houses rehearsal facilities for all UF bands and office space for staff members, was dedicated in November 2008.“When [students] come in the doors, 
there’s a sense of reverence—it’s that nice,” said Director of Bands David Waybright. “I don’t think there’s a better rehearsal fa-cility in the country.” 
It all started in 2002 when Steinbrenner 
walked up to then-UF President Charles Young at a Gators football game and said, “I wanna do something nice for the band.”
The facility has a 5,600-square-foot 
room for band practices, which is enough room for the 350-person  Pride of the Sun-shine marching band to do indoor rehears-
als, Waybright said.
“The facility really kind of enhances the 
reputation of the university in all things 
music, and certainly in all things band,” Waybright said.
Steinbrenner also did similar things for 
Ohio State University’s band program be-cause his wife, Joan, was an alumna. 
“He was a huge band guy when he was 
in college. That was a passion of his,” said Paul Robell, assistant to UF President Ber-nie Machen.But Steinbrenner Band Hall was not the 
sports icon’s only contribution to the uni-versity. 
Steinbrenner also had a passion for 
horses.
He owned a horse farm in Ocala called 
the Kinsman Stud Farm. 
His love of horses led him to donate to 
UF’s College of Veterinary Medicine. 
A large donation was given toward 
completion of an animal hospital in 1989. 
He also donated $400,000 toward a 
horse medical imaging machine for the college in 2005.
Of course, Steinbrenner also gave gen-
erously to UF’s athletics programs. 
According to Robell, Steinbrenner was 
a Gators fan.

nate McKethan Stadium, the university’s Band Hall made possible by Steinbrenner

� THE COMMEMORATIVE 
PLAQUES ARE PAID FOR BY THE UF FOUNDATION AND COST ABOUT $3,000 EACH.

Twenty-nine names have been 
etched into UF’s landscape – liter-ally.
The names are found in front of 
27 of the 44 named buildings at UF on bronze plaques set atop concrete pedestals. The displays, funded by the UF Foundation, honor men and women who significantly contrib-uted to the university.
Some were presidents, some 
deans, at least two soldiers, about 
half a dozen agriculturalists and 
some were just rich enough to do-nate money to the university. Only one is still alive – 81-year-old for-mer UF President Marshall Criser Jr., who still lives in Gainesville.
Two buildings, Griffin-Floyd 
Hall and Keene-Flint Hall, honor two people each with their plaques.Raymer F. Maguire Jr. created 
the commemorative plaque endow-ment program in 1988. The original donation by Maguire, who gradu-ated from UF’s law school in 1948 and died in 2003, was invested, and the money earned from the invest-ment is used each year to support the program.
Currently, constructing the 
black plaques and concrete pedes-tals costs about $3,000 each, said UF Foundation spokesman Chris Braz-
da. He did not know how much 
the older plaques cost.
The program 
is ongoing, and 17 more buildings need plaques and pedestals, Brazda said.
The four most recently installed 
plaques were finished three weeks ago at the Marston Science Library, Norman Hall, Weimer Hall and Williamson Hall, according to Mike Barsaleau, facilities manager for the Plaques pay tribute to 
Gators’ contributionsSEE OBIT, PA gE 8“When [students] come in the

In the article “Underage ban 
begins for bars” it was incor-
rectly reported that the Grog
House has incurred too many 
underage drinking viola-
tions which led to owner Rob Zeller suing the city. These 
violations never occurred and 
Zeller sued the city claiming 
the ordinance was unconsti-
tutional. Also, venues with a capacity of 201 or less can
have up to four violations, not 
five, and larger venues can 
have nine, not 10.
In the article headlined “Acupuncture academy
celebrates first graduation,” it 
was incorrectly reported that 
the school was founded in 1998 instead of 1988. Carrie “Hall” should have read “Hull,” and let it be understood that the class was not the very first to graduate from the Gainesville school, but merely the first to complete the course in this town from beginning to end.Affects Your Community?”

A plaque inscribed with the history of Anderson Hall sits on a pedestal outside an 
entrance to the building Wednesday.
4 plaques were added in summer
UF Foundation.
The foundation works on plaques for the 
oldest buildings first, according to Cindy 
Belknap, the foundation’s director of steward-ship and donor relations.
“The beauty of the endowment is the en-
dowment lasts forever,” she said. “One hun-dred years from now, we’ll still have that en-dowment, so the Emerson Alumni Hall will be a historic building by then.”
The foundation’s biographical researcher, 
Cynthia DeMates, is tasked with finding fam-ily members and finding facts about the people receiving plaques.
After that, Phoebe North, who received her 
master’s of fine arts in poetry from UF, writes the biographies for the plaques.
The biographies need to fit on the 23-inch-
by-30-inch plaques, and before the text is set, North and DeMates fact-check and proofread the less-than-300-word biography.
Each biography is checked about four times.
No plaques have needed to be corrected so 
far, Brazda said.
Some plaques are harder to write biogra-
phies for than others.
“One of the more recent ones we put up, 
we really could not find out anyone living to be able to ask them information, so we just had to depend on our researchers and archives,” Belknap said.
The foundation usually gets family approv-
al before writing the biography in stone.
“Families love to participate,” 
she said
From start to finish, about a dozen hours are 
spent on each plaque’s biography.
In the fall, the foundation will decide on the 
next set of plaques to work on, Barsaleau said.
After the foundation’s decision, the plans 
will be submitted to the Preservation of His-toric Buildings and Sites Committee, who will decide on the best locations for the pedestals and plaques.BUILDING , from page 1By ELIZABETH BEHRMAN

Senators were all about the money 
during Tuesday night’s meeting. 
Kaitlyn Rogers, an intern with the 
Student Health Care Center, gave a pre-
sentation about the benefits of allowing 
students to use private health insurance 
at the SHCC, which will be accepted be-ginning in the fall. 
She told the Senate that students 
have asked SHCC administrators to ac-cept their private insurance for years.  
Currently, the center only accepts 
UF insurance or cash.
“We’re kind of piggy-backing off of 
how [other Florida universities have] done it,” Rogers said.
Because the center will now accept 
private insurance, students will no lon-ger have to persuade their personal – or parents’ – insurance  companies to re-imburse them because the companies will be billed directly, Rogers said.
Students who wish to keep their af-
fairs private will still have the opportu-nity to pay out-of-pocket. The univer-sity insurance plan will still be available 
for students to purchase, she said. Rog-
ers said she hopes this new policy will prevent students from having to go off campus for health care. 
“We do think it’s such a positive 
thing, and we really want them to use the resources here at UF that are pro-vided for them,” she said.
Senators also allocated more than 
$1,400 to student organizations, in-cluding the Outreach Ambassadors Program, Quidditch at UF and Gator Freethought.  The money was ap-proved to pay for the organizations’ 
equipment, supplies and advertising. 
Lastly, senators voted unanimously 
to move the spring 2012 SG elections 
from Feb. 28 to 29 to Feb. 21 to 22, due to a conflict with Spring Break.

Come November, UF’s Stu-
dent Government may challenge 
the drinking ordinance currently affecting 101 Cantina and The Swamp Restaurant.
Seven senators representing 
both the Student Alliance party and the Unite Party met in the Re-itz Union on Tuesday evening to discuss taking action against the 
ordinance.Most of the discussion was 
done by Senate Minority Leader 
Jon Ossip, who stressed the need 
for action as opposed to simply 
passing a non-binding resolution.
The senators agreed to try to 
repeal the ordinance via ballot pe-
tition in the November city elec-tions.
Ossip said he is confident they 
can obtain the necessary signa-tures to get the measure on the 
ballot. 
“In terms of Student Govern-
ment, we’ve collected thousands 
of petitions for the Student Gov-ernment ballots,” he said. “There 
were over 5,700 signatures collect-ed toward online voting. If you 
can get 5,700 signatures for some-
thing that only affects SG, I think we can get far more signatures for something that affects the entire 
Student Body.”SHCC to take insurance

Federal passport fees went up Tuesday.
Previously, applicants older than 16 had to 
pay a $100 fee, which has been raised to $110. There’s been an added processing fee of $25. Renewals are also up from $75 to $110.
Passport fees go toward their own produc-tion but also help cover costs for emergency 
services for overseas citizens, according to the 
U.S. Department of State’s website.
Part of the fee hike is supposed to help cov-
er new advancements in passport-protection technology. U.S. officials hope the passports’ new security measures, such as integrated computer chips containing individuals’ bio-metric data, will keep travelers safer while abroad.“Investing in new technology to prevent 
passport fraud is one of our key priorities, and an ongoing initiative,” the website stated.
The fee will help expand 
passport infrastructure and service. The last five years saw a general increase in passport 
demand, peaking at 18.4 million in 2007.
“To increase our presence in underserved 
areas, the Department has undertaken a sys-tematic expansion of the passport network,” 
the website stated.
Gregory Webster, an assistant professor 
of psychology at UF, said he travels interna-
tionally at least twice a year. He renewed his passport last in 2007 and was surprised to hear about the fee increases, but not too worried.
“I’m a professor,” he said. “So an extra $35 
is pretty easy. If I were a student, I could see how that would make it harder to travel.” Federal passport fees increase to cover security costs“We really want them to use 
the resources here at UF that 
are provided for them.”

STATE� THE CLUB MAY JOIN THE 
DOWNTOWN AREA.
BY LAUREN CANINA
Alligator Contributing Writer
The Rev. William Russell thinks 
downtown Gainesville could use a 
little less alcohol and a little more Jesus. 
Bothered by what he calls “to-
tal immorality” throughout the Gainesville bar scene, Russell has started collecting donations for a $1.3 million, Christian-based night-club in the downtown area. 
“It has always been block-to-
block alcoholic-serving bars,” Rus-sell said. “We want to give an alter-native to UF students and everyone else who frequents the downtown area.”
Club Glory, which Russell has 
tentatively named the facility, will be open to all who want to socialize and party alcohol-free. Teenagers, adults, college students, seniors and church groups are all welcome.
Russell said he hasn’t chosen a 
spot for the club, but he is wants to renovate a club that has been closed down for some time. 
The club will have a dance room, 
indoor restaurants and rooms that serve multiple purposes. Aside from being a nightclub, the facility will also offer counseling, financial 
and addiction services, HIV 
testing and crisis 
intervention, ac-
cording to Russell. 
He also plans to offer services 
that help people with depression or those who are unemployed due to injury. 
Russell said he has received over-whelming support from not just his own congregation, but from church-es and businesses around the state.
In just over one month, The Trin-
ity Church of Gainesville has raised about $100,000 for the project. 
He said he plans to hold fund-
raisers and raise all the necessary 
funds within a year. 
“It can’t be anything but a win-
win for the city of Gainesville,” Rus-
sell said. “We might even take the burden off some other places.”
There are also plans to open a 
food bank and clothing drop at the facility, according to Douglas Gun-tor, a member of the United Church of Gainesville.
The Rev. Wilbert Brozoski, a min-
ister from Jacksonville who is con-tributing 25 percent of his income to the club, sees it as an opportunity for everyone to stay out of trouble and become closer to God. 
Alana Hardeman, who is a mem-
ber of Campus Crusaders for Christ, supports the club. 
“I think the whole idea is great,” 
she said. “It’s a safe place for people to go who don’t necessarily want to drink and want to have a fun time without that.”
Church seeks donations to open Christian night club
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
ORLANDO — Florida Attorney General 
and gubernatorial candidate Bill McCollum is changing his tone and joining the legal fight over the much-debated Arizona immigration law.
In a move that comes after intense scru-
tiny on his immigration policies from GOP primary challenger Rick Scott, McCollum said Wednesday that his office filed a brief in Arizona supporting the law. He also is urging Florida lawmakers to enact similar legislation in the upcoming special legislative session.
“We probably won’t adopt all of what Ari-
zona has done because Florida is different than Arizona,” McCollum said. “There are things in that law that are very, very good.”
McCollum was considered the likely Re-
publican nominee for nearly a year until Scott entered the race in April and quickly spent more than $20 million of his own money on television ads. Most of those ads criticized Mc-Collum, who now trails in the polls and is see-
ing his resources dwindle.
Scott already has berated McCollum for 
initially opposing the Arizona law before it 
was revised to try to eliminate racial profil-ing. Scott’s office issued a statement earlier Wednesday calling on Florida legislators to adopt tougher immigration laws.
“The federal government has failed to do their job for far too long and the Obama Ad-ministration has no intention of doing anything 
about it, so the states have to take matters into their own hands,” Scott said.
Now McCollum wants 
the state to take up legisla-tion similar to Arizona. He 
is working with state Rep. 
William Snyder, R-Stuart, 
to introduce a law in the Florida legislature. Florida 
joins eight other states — Michigan, Alabama, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Virginia and Texas — in filing the brief supporting Arizona’s law.“The real issue here is the states have the 
right to enforce the laws, federal or state, and there’s no right for the federal government to try and pre-empt that,” McCollum said.
The Arizona law, set to take effect July 29, 
requires police to check the immigration status of anyone they think is in the country illegally. The federal government has filed a lawsuit 
challenging the legislation.
Opponents of the law say legal residents 
who are Hispanic would be unjustly harassed 
and that immigration is a federal rather than a state responsibility. Supporters say police won’t stop people solely on skin color and ar-gue that illegal immigrants are taking jobs, us-ing public services and filling prisons.

Today’s question: Would you visit a Christian nightclub?
83 TOTAL VOTES45% YES55% NOTuesday’s question: Should Two Rivers School District be able to keep the Gators’ logo?Senior shares advice with freshmen
Grab your Magic 8-Ball and give it a shake.
The Alligator posted a two-part column se-
ries by Bryan Griffin on Thursday and Tuesday 
giving advice to freshmen. I’ve got some better advice.
No. 1: To my desperate brethren, if you’re really 
looking to find a girl, then college is a great place. An Alligator article published March 30 said, “Six out of 10 new UF students will be women in fall 2010, which is the largest gender gap favoring female students that UF has ever had.”
But word of advice: If you’re really that desperate 
for that first college relationship with a real woman, 
then change your major from engineering to nursing. 
Really.
No. 2: Student Government is dumber than Lindsay 
Lohan’s fingernails; resist the urge to care. 
Do you really think you’ll get hired because you 
voted for the Unite Party every election, or because you helped found a brand-new, doesn’t-do-anything party?
You won’t. There are only three things SG is good at doing: 
whining about the other SG party, spending money, passing meaningless resolutions and playing dirty dur-ing SG elections. (I mean four. I took math for liberal arts. Don’t hold it against me.)
Want some practical advice? Buy a bunch of “I Vot-
ed” stickers and wear them during SG campaigns. The stickers ward off campaigners as much as Buffy the Vampire Slayer wards off Edward “I-sparkle-more-than-a-freakin’-fairy” Cullen.
No. 3: Girls, you’re not off the hook, either. You think 
intelligent debate is the ladies on “The View”. It’s not.
People almost care less about Team Edward vs. Team 
Jacob than they care about Unite Party or Student Alli-ance party. (I’m personally Team Pantazi every day of the week, especially if we’re talking about Erin Andrews instead of Bella.)
No. 4: Don’t pick up a musical 
instrument, language or hobby. We’re not impressed.
Guys, we know you’re trying 
to grasp at some semblance of 
a conversation starter or looking for some way to set yourself apart from the rest of the drunken morons that 
you call fraternity brothers.
But instead, you come off more like an attention-
craved, pre-teen, wannabe Casanova. Knowing the four 
chords repeated in “Wonderwall” and every other pa-thetic pop song doesn’t make you an impressive musi-
cian. We believe you’re a musician as much as we be-
lieve Sean Kingston can write his “girl” a symphony.
No. 5: Be a hypocrite. Do something you never 
thought you did. If you judged football as being “mind-
less” or “dull,” then go to a football game. If you think yoga is only for health freaks, then try it out. If you’re a hater like me, then listen to Justin Bieber (just once though, we don’t want you to actually support the pre-pubescent, high-pitched Usher wannabe).
Or run for SG.No. 6: Most importantly, and never forget this, you 
must ignore any advice you read in the Alligator. We’re college students; we don’t know anything. Don’t obey my every word. And certainly don’t take me seriously. The Alligator exists to inform, not to be your mommy and daddy. Our advice is about as wise as Ke$ha when she wakes up in the morning.

reate an eighth-grade social 
than discover Jesus at the 
bottom of a whiskey bottle, as it’s going to be an alco-hol-free establishment. Un-
less they have some sort of 
communion wine, we think “nightclub” might be the wrong word.
It’s difficult for us to 
wrap our minds around the concept — a Christian experience complete with 
dim lighting, dance music 
and people dressed to the nines reveling in their so-briety. 
Maybe all those edited 
versions of albums will see a spike in sales, or, more likely, DC Talk might final-ly reap the rewards of pio-neering Christian rap.
These are all trivial mat-ters though. The real mys-tery is how a place like this could hope to turn a profit when it appeals to such a 
limited audience. 
Catholics drink, so they 
won’t be banging down 
the door to get in. That just leaves Protestants, many 
sects of which refuse to be 
in the same room together. 
The financial woes could 
only be solved with some 
sort of contribution system. 
Maybe they could pass 
around a plate or some-thing for donations. Better yet, they should have their regulars chip in a percent-age of their yearly earnings to keep the club alive.
It all sounds a little too 
far removed from what Christianity is all about, and the end result of com-bining religion and night-life is a neutered experience worth less than the sum of its parts.

UF eases Haiti ban for 
faculty, grad students
It has been more than five months since the adminstra-tion banned UF-related travel to Haiti for students and faculty, but it looks like the university is starting to loosen 
up a bit. It’s about time.
While the revised policy continues to ban official travel 
to Haiti — namely anything that uses university funds or resources —  for undergraduates, faculty members are now permitted to travel to the island as long as they fill out travel forms. Graduate students may travel if they meet several re-quirements and apply for a waiver. Good news for Gators wanting to do research in Haiti.
Since the ban went into effect on Feb. 5, UF has made more 
than a couple bone-headed decisions and seemed unwilling to make exceptions for anyone — the adminstration told a 
pair of grad students they couldn’t use footage from Haiti in 
their thesis before backing down after threats of legal action.
We understand traveling to the island nation after it was 
ravaged by an earthquake isn’t something that just anyone should do. In the aftermath of the disaster a lot of people did more harm than good in spite of their intentions, but it wasn’t UF’s place to control travel. 
Despite the good news, it might still be a good idea to 
keep your vacation to Haiti on the back burner.

Dairy products come with heavy price
Milk, and all other dairy products that 
we enjoy so much, does not come without 
sacrifice. The only way a dairy cow can 
produce milk is by giving birth to a calf.
In some factory farms, the newborn 
calves are immediately chained into crates 
so small that they cannot turn around. A 
few weeks later, they are often too weak 
to walk to the transportation truck for slaughter: Their little knees buckle, and they fall.  
Right now in America, there are no 
regulations to ban slaughter of downed veal calves. Please write Secretary Tom Vilsack, U.S. Department of Agriculture, 1400 Independence Ave. SW, Washington, 
D.C.  20259, or call 202-720-2791. Ask him 
to amend the regulations to ban slaughter of downed veal calves and enforce the Hu-
mane Methods of Slaughter Act that pre-
vents any animal from being slaughtered while conscious.
In my opinion, we should stop eating 
veal to end this torture altogether.

Man hopes to save lives with DUI story
Matthew Maher, a 26-year-old former 
professional soccer player and Temple Uni-versity graduate, is now in prison for the 
next five and a half years for killing an in-
nocent man while driving drunk on March 7, 2009.
Before he began his prison sentence, Matthew spoke to more than 7,000 students 
at 36 schools. His presentation, titled “I’m 
That Guy,” was developed by the New Jer-sey Traffic and Safety Alliance. 
Prior to March 7, 2009, Matt was “that 
guy.” He was active in his community, ex-
celled in academics and sports and came 
from a great family. In fact, his father was even the police chief at one time and now serves as the undersheriff.
Now he’s “that guy,” a drunk driver who 
killed an innocent person. The responses to his presentation have been overwhelming. Matthew journals daily in prison and mails his entries home to be posted on his website, 
themattmaherstory.com, by his family. 
The victim’s family, supportive of our 
efforts to spread this story, began contribut-
ing their own blog entries to the site. Rarely do offenders and their victims’ families join 
together to offer a glimpse into their new 
realities.
We’re sharing Matt’s compelling “I’m 
That Guy” story to prevent future tragedies like the one that occurred on March 7, 2009. 
His blog offers startling insights into pris-
on life, the design and implementation of parole-incentive programs and the general attitude and approach that most prisoners 
adopt while incarcerated. 
Matt is determined to be “in jail with a 
purpose.” He has dedicated his life to hon-
oring the life of his victim, Hort Kap, by us-ing his platform to reach others and spread 
awareness about the dangers of driving un-
der the influence.

Have you ever noticed someone walk straight out 
of a public restroom without washing his or her hands? Have you heard of someone who lives 
by the rule of “if it’s yellow, let it mellow; if it’s brown, flush it down”? What about people who sneeze directly into their hands? This summer, I’ve seen my fair share of disgusting human behavior.
I’ve seen tons of guys walk right past the restroom 
sinks. If you are one of those guys, read every bit of this column. I don’t get it. If you don’t know how to wash your hands, Google it. I wonder how many unwashed, filthy hands I’ve shaken.
According to the Mississippi Department of Health, 
our hands bring us into contact with disease-causing bac-teria and viruses every day. According to Wisconsin’s De-partment of Health Services, not washing your hands can 
lead to diseases spread through fecal-oral transmission. 
Infections that can be transmitted include salmonello-sis, hepatitis A, giardiasis, enterovirus and amebiasis (to name a few). Most of these infections are easily treated, but amebiasis is quite serious.
According to the World Health Organization, 70,000 
people die from amebiasis annually worldwide. Amebia-sis infections can last for years. Luckily, for those of us 
stateside, amebiasis rarely occurs. It affects people who live in moist, temperate climates 
throughout the world.
You should always wash your 
hands before handling food, setting 
the table, eating, treating a scrape or cut, tending to some-
one who is sick and putting in or taking out contact lens-
es.
You should wash your hands after using the restroom, 
changing diapers, coughing,  sneezing, preparing food, 
handling  wounds, playing with animals, handling  dirty 
dishes, being around people who are  sick and taking out 
the garbage.
Now, for your handy dandy, hand-washing in-
structions straight from Mississippi’s Department of Health.  Proper hand-washing takes at least 20  seconds. To 
properly wash your hands:  Wet your hands under warm 
running water and apply some soap, lather up and rub 
your hands together hard to scrub dirt and germs away. 
Always wash hands front and back and between fingers. 
Wash around your wrists and under your nails, rinse well 
with warm water and  dry  your hands completely with a 
clean cloth or (even better) a paper towel.
“If it’s yellow, let it mellow, if it’s brown, flush it 
down.” This statement and the act  itself are completely 
revolting to me. I heard two guys talk about it in the re-stroom once.
Apparently, there are no health risks to this.Sometimes the item in question can be green, too. In 
areas  of the world where drought is frequent,  selective 
flushing (as it’s called) is strongly encouraged. Most toi-
lets use at least 1.6 gallons of water per flush, if you skip 
two flushes a day, this saves up to 1,168 gallons  of water 
per year. I won’t discourage anyone from selective flush-
ing anymore, but don’t expect me to follow this rule. I’ll 
have to live with my environmental sins.
Sneezing in your hand is another thing that completely 
freaks me out. Most people think that sneezing in your 
hand is fine, but  if you don’t immediately wash your 
hands, then you’ve pretty much spread those germs ev-
erywhere. 
The Centers for Disease Control say you should cough 
or sneeze into your sleeve or elbow. Especially during 
flu season, someone near you can breathe in your air or 
touch a surface contaminated with your germs and be-
come ill. If you see someone doing something disgust-ing, feel free to call them out or give them step-by-step in-
structions. You’ll save a life, sort of, or enter a completely 
awkward situation in a restroom.

The Steinbrenner Band Hall, dedicated in 2008, was funded by New York Yankees owner George Stein-
brenner, who died Tuesday at age 80.
Steinbrenner belonged to 
the Bull Gator program
baseball field, were donated by 
him in 1977. 
He also was a member of the 
Bull Gator program, a club for the athletic department’s top donors. 
“We are deeply saddened to 
hear the news of George Stein-brenner’s death,” said John James, executive director of Gator Boosters, in a statement. “He was a wonderful friend to 
the University of Florida, sup-
porting both athletics and aca-demics.”
Steinbrenner became inter-
ested in UF because the school was the major research univer-sity in the state and he enjoyed the athletics at the school, Ro-bell said. Steinbrenner does have 
family ties to the university, 
though. 
His son Hal, who now is 
the co-owner of the New York 
Yankees along with his brother 
Hank, received his MBA from 
UF in 1994. 
His death 
fell on the day of Major 
League Base-
ball’s All-Star 
Game.  
Fans and 
players ob-served a mo-
ment of silence prior to the game. 
Flags at Angel Stadium in 
Anaheim, Calif., flew at half-staff. 
His funeral will likely be 
held this weekend in Tampa.  OBIT , from page 1� THE AVERAGE RESIDENT WILL SEE

Starting Oct.1, the cost of water, waste-
water and gas for residents served by 
Gainesville Regional Utilities will rise after 
the Gainesville City Commission and May-
or Craig Lowe approved the GRU-proposed rate increases at a meeting Tuesday.
GRU’s plan also included a decrease of 
the monthly electricity charges to citizens. 
With these rate changes, the average 
resident will see a $4.21 increase on their monthly bill, said Diane Wilson, managing utility analyst at GRU.  
An average resident consumes 813 kilo-
watt hours of electricity, 6,000 gallons of water, 5,000 gallons of wastewater and 25 therms of gas per month.
In the past two years, GRU has noticed a continuous decrease of water usage by its customers. The cost increases are meant to 
compensate for the pressure on sales it has 
experienced. 
In outlining the rise in the 
cost of water, GRU divided usage into three tiers.
Rates for customers who 
use up to 9,000 gallons of wa-
ter a month will rise about 24 percent. 
Customers who use between 10,000 and 
24,000 gallons will have a 3 percent rate in-crease. 
The third tier, for any usage above 24,000 
gallons, will not have any cost changes. 
During the meeting, commissioners 
were concerned the majority of customers fall under the first tier category, which is to have the largest rate increase.  
“My heart just goes out to the first tier 
because I know a good segment of our citi-zens who cannot, at this time, afford this increase right now,” Gainesville city com-missioner Scherwin Henry said.GRU announces rate changes for water, gas, electric

At 12:15 a.m., international DJ Steve Aoki took the stage at The Vault Nightclub. Neon lights shot off in every direction, giant 
floodlights flashed on and off, smoke filled the room and the bass was dropped. 
Aoki, who makes a point to interact with the crowd, didn’t set up in the crow’s nest of a DJ booth the openers used, but was nestled 
within the VIP section, surrounded by drunk crazies on every side. 
The crowd was in a veritable fist-pumping frenzy from the get-go. Within the first 20 minutes of his set, Aoki had already climbed 
the PA and stage dived.  That was just the beginning. Soon he was spraying expensive champagne all over the front rows, shoot-
ing water out of a Super Soaker and sending handfuls of glow sticks soaring over the crowd. Despite almost drowning in its own 
sweat, the crowd was lovin’ every second.aoki odyssey
beer 
By RICHARD STEHLI
avenue writer  
Bob Sylvester’s workplace feels a little bit more like a ga-
rage project than a brewery.  Despite its storage-unit looks, 
Tarpon Springs-based Saint Somewhere Brewery has devel-
oped a reputation throughout the 20 states to which it is dis-
tributed as a brewer of high-quality, Belgian-style beer.
For the most part, Saint Somewhere is a one-man opera-
tion.  On bottling day, however, Sylvester puts out an email 
asking his devoted fan base – myself included – for a few hours of their time to help bottle his beer.
Fourteen of us answered the call for help last week to put 
the latest batch of Pays du Soleil, a lightly spiced saison, in bottles ready for distribution. 
A few volunteers had experience working with Saint Some -
where, but most of us were rookie brewery employees, ages ranging from student to retiree.
Things started slow, but in no time we were flying.  Bottles 
came out of the box, then were sanitized and rinsed using two separate pump cleaners.  One veteran volunteer ran the four-
spigot bottling system, filling and replacing bottles as soon as they were full, then passing them over to the corking station.  
Using two well-worn bench corkers, complete with oven-mitt 
pads on the handles to prevent blisters, we stuffed corks into the bottles, which then made their way to the caging area.  
Cages were set over the corks (think champagne bottles) 
and then cinched down with an electric drill or by hand with a hook bolt.  Four turns of the cage wire and the bottles were 
ready to box and stack on a palette.
Without any mechanical slowdowns, it only takes one min-
ute and 15 seconds for a bottle to go from box to box, and we averaged twelve bottles per minute.  Not bad for a bunch of 
greenhorns.
Sylvester himself has only been homebrewing for a little 
over 10 years – the brewery is approaching its third birth-day – but he quickly found a passion for brewing the beers of 
Belgium.  “Belgians are a little more adventurous,” Sylvester 
said.  “I’m not a big fan of recipes.”
Most Saint Somewhere beers are based on the saison, a 
style originating in the farmhouses of Wallonia, the French-
speaking region of Belgium.  Saisons feature wild, natural fla-
vors and are brewed in high temperatures, which is good news for brewing in Florida.
Sylvester uses open fermentation, allowing wild yeasts in 
the air into the beer, enhancing flavor and making for a more unique product. 
“You can see it right there,” Sylvester said, pointing to 
the lid of his fermentation vat, held slightly ajar with a small block.  “Keeping the tank open allows a little more wildness, a 
little more originality.”
Our palette of empty bottles quickly dwindled down to the 
wood, and as sweat began to soak through our shirts, conver -
sations quickly sprang up. 
What you’ve been drinking, what you’ve been brewing, 
what breweries you’ve visited – common ground was not hard to find.  We were all there for the beer.
After getting paid (pizza and a six pack of freshly bottled 
beer to take home), everyone left with a smile on their faces.  
It’s the passion for good beer that links us all together – 
brewers, distributors and drinkers alike.  Saint Somewhere is 
available at Dorn’s Liquors, 352-378-0229.

By day, Adrienne Filardo, 22, works as a 
grant assistant in the UF Department of Neu -
rosurgery. On a typical day of work, she wears 
a cardigan, skirt and pantyhose – looking “as June Cleaver as possible,” she said. But three nights a week, donning fishnet stockings, short 
shorts and a thick layer of purple eye shadow, 
she is Rage-rienne, the roller derby girl, act -
ing as a blocker for her team, the Gainesville Roller Rebels. 
Roller derby is an all-women’s sport in which 
two five-girl teams skate around an oval track. Four members from each team, the blockers, 
guard against the opposing team’s spring skat -
er, the jammer, to keep her from lapping them. 
Each team scores one point for each time the jammer laps the opposing team, according to the team’s website, www.gainesvillerollerreb -
els.com. A roller derby match is known as a bout. 
Rage-rienne, the team’s sponsorship and 
media relations manager, was one of the 
Rebels at Skate Station Funworks, 1311 NW 
76th Blvd., who—despite their appearance as a group of punk-rock Sonic waitresses, some with tattoos showing through their stockings and sleeveless black T-shirts were flashing en -
couraging smiles at a group of new recruits. 
She said most of the team, ages 18 to 49, 
hold day jobs as homemakers, teachers and UF staff members. 
The Rebels went around the room introduc -
ing themselves to the recruits by their derby names: Stocky Balboa, Sara Leethal, Dr. Po -
pHer, Suzie Bonebreaker and Zelda Shagnasty (No. 69). 
Guided by members of the team, the der -
by girls-to-be looked over their waiver forms, which included guides on what protective gear to buy, how to eat before a bout and the rules 
of the game. 
One recruit, Marta Puyana, a 39-year-old 
local high school teacher, said she was sur -
prised at how detailed the form was. She said 
she decided to check out the team when she found out the derby was an all-women’s sport that emphasized camaraderie. She would not name the high school where she teaches. 
“It’s like a whole other family,” said Sarah 
Purcell, 29, a veterinary technician in exotic and wildlife medicine at UF, known on the track for two years as Sara Leethal (she said she 
wears scrubs by day and hot pants by night). 
“It’s a lot of powerful women,” she said. 
Filardo said the friends she made through 
roller derby played a large part in her decision to join the team. “In derby with your team -
mates, there’s no such thing as TMI,” she said. “We play together, get hit together, win and lose together.” 
After reading over the form, the recruits 
suited up and skated out to the rink for their first night of what the league calls “fresh meat training,” a three-month training period where new skaters learn the techniques and rules of the sport, then take an exam on their new skills before they can compete in their first bout. 
After fresh meat training, the girls are al-
lowed to choose their derby names and num -
bers. 
Another recruit, Lauren Ashley, 22, said she 
has been to two or three recruitment nights. She has not turned in a waiver to start training. She said her feet, thighs and hips were aching after a just a few minutes on the rink. 
For now, she said, skating in an hour-long 
bout is a far-off goal. 
“I‘m just trying to stay up,” she said. “All of 
us haven’t skated since we were like 10.” 
Filardo said because of the demanding na-
ture of the sport and the 20 hours of training a week, eight out of every 15 to 30 recruits stick with it. 
“A lot of people just aren’t prepared for how 
much time it’s going to take and how much it’s going to hurt,” she said, after mentioning a grapefruit-sized bruise on her thigh from a recent practice. 
Purcell said the hardest part for new skat -
ers is their first fall on the track.10, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, JULY 15, 2010

  Kicking off in Colombia and now 
making it all the way to Gainesville, 
Zumba is sweeping the nation off its feet (literally) one dance class at a time.
  Zumba combines high-energy, up-
beat Latin music, rhythm and moves to form a workout program that is open for people of all ages, shapes and sizes. There is a class for everyone with different levels ranging from Zum-batomic for children to Zumba Gold for seniors.
  Just like any workout program, the 
key to Zumba is to start out small, and in this particular case, concentrate on the instructor’s footwork.
  Individuals need no prior dancing 
experience to attend a class. 
  “No matter the level of ﬁ  tness a 
person is at, there’s still a period of getting comfortable and making the transition of stepping out of yourself 
and dropping any self-conscious feel-
ings you may have,” said Remy Acosta, a one-year Zumba dancer and soon-to-be instructor. “You’ve just got to feel the music.”
  A typical class starts with a few 
warm-up songs to get everyone pumped up for the workout portion of the class, which usually ranges from 
eight to 10 songs with each having 
four to ﬁ  ve different steps.
  “If you get into it, it doesn’t feel like a workout at all, though,” Acosta said. 
“You’re just straight-up dancing.”
  Even though Zumba fanatics think of the class as a good time rather than a workout, that doesn’t mean they 
aren’t getting one. A fast-paced hour of Zumba can burn more than 500 
calories.
  “I mean even for people who are in great shape, it will still bust their butts the ﬁ  rst few classes,” Acosta said. “It’s 
intense, and the sweat starts pouring pretty quickly.”
  The main appeal to Zumba is that 
it’s a great way to exercise while still being able to enjoy yourself. It’s even been coined a “ﬁ  tness party.”
  “If it’s a really good class, you’re 
having a party in that class,” Acosta 
said. “People get loud. Sometimes we 
start hooting and hollering and shout-ing out until we’re louder than the mu-sic. It’s almost like a club environment, except people are sober.”
  This highly energetic workout pro-
gram has become a phenomenon. It’s not unusual for some of the more popular classes in Gainesville to ﬁ  ll up 
to capacity due to the large number of 
people who are coming in search of Zumba.
  “It’s just so catchy,” Acosta said. 
“It’s incredible. You get a high from do-ing it, and it lasts for hours and hours after the class.”
  Although it started off primarily 
among the Latin community, Zumba 
has opened its doors to all different 
walks of life. 
  “You start bringing a bunch of dif-
ferent people together who really en-joy dancing and they bring in their own style of music and culture,” Acosta said. “It’s started to become interna-tional and is all over the world now.”

 To paraphrase a wise man, “Just when you 
think you know the answers, someone changes the questions.” Change is inevi-
table, just like another season of “Dancing with the Stars,” and it hit me today that I am spending 
my last moments in the house I grew up in writing 
this column.
 I knew this was coming for years. My par-
ents decided to sell the house so they could live closer to the water and their boat (I don’t blame them. Who wouldn’t jump at the opportunity to drink and ﬁ  sh all day with minimal planning and effort?). Once I realized this, every time I came home I acted like it could potentially be the last time I see my house or my hometown of Miami. Surprisingly enough, that didn’t mean getting hammered drunk every night. I celebrated with the little things: The spot in the backyard where I would light things on ﬁ  re with a magnifying glass 
(don’t worry, guys, I grew out of that phase. I use 
gasoline and matches now), and the nook in my old room where my Playboy stash resided.
  This time, however, I did something I had nev-
er done before. I brought a friend to stay with me. I usually don’t like to introduce people to my fam-ily (the devoted few of you who have read all of my columns know why), but I felt like I had to this time. I shared as much as I could with my friend, who had never been south of Orlando. I had to show her everything. This is the way I drove to school. This is where 
my sister hit me in the 
head with a rock. I once walked along this street. This is where I had my ﬁ  rst car accident. This is the haunted cave where I 
buried my treasure. This all existed, and now you can help me prove it.
  In some sort of ﬁ  tting event, my friend and I spent the last night in the house watching “Up” around a bunch of packing boxes. At the end, as Carl watches his house, the thing he associates with the love of his life, drift away, he comes to grips with the whole thing and says, “It’s just a 
house.” There is more life to be lived. My house, 
although I’ve spent many good times in it, really is only a set of walls and a roof. I’ll be able to move on. I’ll be ready to answer these new ques-tions. My only regret in all of this is that my dog can’t talk like the one in “Up.” Panchito just eats all our mangoes and poops on the patio. At least I won’t have to clean it up; that job can be left for the new owners.

DJ Aoki rallies, electriﬁ  es Gainesville party scene  
 By KAT BEIN 
avenue writer
  DJ-party madness was in full effect 
July 5, as Gainesville celebrated the 
Fourth a day late with electro-droppin’, champagne-poppin’ Steve Aoki.
  The 32-year-old DJ and founder 
of Dim Mak records dropped by The 
Vault Nightclub  to share his unique 
and energetic brand of performance for the ﬁ  rst time.
  For those who managed to get 
their names on the meet-and-greet list, it was like stepping on pins and needles waiting for Aoki to arrive.
  “I’m very excited, very nervous,” said Carlos Masquida, Gainesville- party-scenester extraordinaire. “I’ve been listening to his Warp remix to get ready. I’m like, starstruck. It’s gonna 
be cute.”
  Fashionably late, Aoki showed up 
in the Vault’s second-story lounge 
area to sign merchandise and take pictures. Masquida, along with every-one else in the room, crowded around the merch table and wiggled viciously past one another to get closer in line.
  But it wasn’t always screaming 
fans, spotlights and doe-eyed young girls. This DJ-ing thing is a pretty re-cent development for Aoki, relatively speaking.  Born in Miami and raised in Cali-
fornia, Aoki is the third child of the Japanese Olympic wrestler who we all know better as the founder of Beni-
hana.
  While some siblings followed in 
his father’s footsteps, Aoki admits 
to being terrible behind the hiba-chi and went the musical route. He founded his label, Dim Mak, in 1996. Throughout the years, he signed and worked with some of the hottest artists on the underground. He 
helped push bands like Battles, Bloc 
Party and The Von Bondies. 
  More recently, he started work-
ing with some of the best electro-DJs on the scene. Dim Mak has signed MSTRKRFT, The Bloody Beetroots and Machines Don’t Care. 
Aoki said he digs hard to ﬁ  nd the 
artists he signs, but thanks the Inter-net most of all.
  “In this day and age it’s so much 
easier to hear music than even four, ﬁ  ve years ago,” Aoki said. “The Inter-net brings you music immediately and you get that immediate feedback.”
  Aoki said getting up on the decks 
was a direct result of working with 
these artists. 
He said he would throw label par-
ties and lots of the band members 
and various DJs would be up there, and he just felt like it was his turn.
  “Since it’s my party, I started DJ-
ing,” he said. “I was really promoting and just progressed and excelled.” 
Aoki said his love and passion for the 
art of the craft developed alongside his talent.
  “You do drugs long enough and 
you get addicted,” he said. “It’s the same with DJ-ing.”
  Aoki’s ﬁ  rst DJ-mix record, Pillow-
face and His Airplane Chronicles, hit shelves in January 2008, and he re-
corded a BBC Essential Mix that same 
year in August.

on community improvement   
  By ERIN RAUCH
 avenue writer
 
  Alachua County ofﬁ  cials turned soil and 
heads on Saturday at the Alachua County Ad-
ministration Building.
  Virgil Mathis, an intern with the Alachua 
County Ofﬁ  ce of Sustainability, said about 100 
community members attended the Downtown 
Farmer’s Garden Dedication. Alachua County Manager Randall Reid served as the master of ceremonies.
  “In Alachua County, we have made a major 
stride in recognizing that sustainability is not just about the environment,” Reid said. “It is about community and strengthening the fabric of community.”
  The garden is on the southeast corner of 
ﬁ  rst Avenue and South Main Street on the lawn of the Alachua County Administration Building. Volunteers built raised beds and planted fruit trees as well as a variety of annuals and peren-nials.
  Under the coordination of the Florida Organ-
ic Growers and Abundant Edible Landscapes, about 18 volunteers from Alachua YouthBuild 
and 40 volunteers from the UF Young Entrepre-
neurs in Leadership and Sustainability helped with the preparation and planting.
    Sean McLendon, Alachua County Sustain-
ability program manager, said the garden will serve as a teaching tool for the community. Residents will have the opportunity to learn about rain barrels and composting along with the ins and outs of gardening.
  McLendon said the garden would not have 
come alive without help from 14 sponsors. According to Mathis, the Downtown Ro-tary Club donated $4,000 to the Downtown Farmer’s Garden.
  Walt Barry, past presi-
dent of the Downtown Rotary 
Club, said he looked forward to many replica-tions of the downtown garden in the future.
  “This is a fulﬁ  llment of reconnecting com-
munity with local food supply,” Reid said, a connection he said has been lost after a single generation walked away from the soil.

‘Unspectacular’ talent show debuts at The Laboratory
By LIDIA DINKOVA
avenue contributing writer
On stage at The Laboratory, Tom Miller, clad 
in a red button-up shirt, hunches over his type -
writer, his face hidden behind his sunglasses 
and a frayed straw hat. 
He often likes to write before a show and last 
Monday night was no exception.  It was the first Tom Miller Summer Unspectacular Show, an open mic event that collects a diversely talented crowd from UF and the Gainesville community into The Laboratory, a cafe of science, located at  818 W. University Ave. The show is held at 9:34 p.m. every Monday night and will continue for the rest of the summer.   
“I don’t want anything ordinary,” said Tom 
Miller, the show’s organizer and host, regard -
ing the talent going on stage. “It needs to either kick ass or it needs to suck so bad that it finds its own remarkable qualities.” 
A writer, artist, musician and activist, Miller’s 
diverse career includes a run for Gainesville City Commission. He was the bass player for six bands, including Middle Earth, Penguin and Plastic Age, and the writer and director of more than 75 independent VideoFilms. He once did a 17-hour reading of Truman Capote’s “In Cold Blood,” and he participated in a Naked Press Conference to announce a fundraising drive for 
the Gainesville Community School of the Arts. 
The Summer Unspectacular Show is a con-
tinuation from a previous open mic night held 
on Monday nights at The Laboratory. When or -
ganizers asked Miller to take over the event he jumped on the idea. 
“I always thought it was the most interesting 
night in Gainesville because everybody is so dif-ferent,” he said. “Basically if everybody is there, 
I don’t want to be there.” This spirit is clearly reflected in the show, 
and 12 people gathered to celebrate talent in 
its many forms. 
“I want people who entertain audiences,” 
Miller continued. “I don’t want people who bring their friends to clap for them and to get drunk.”
As the performers took 
their turn on the stage, each conveyed a much stronger purpose for being there than 
just to enjoy their free shot at 
fame.
Stand-up comedian 
Chayce Fourwinds, also 
known as “Lady Chayce,” went on, not only for his act, but also to show people that after years of being a performer he does not plan on slow -
ing down. 
“As long as I can walk, I want to turn around 
the world and make it think,” he said. “If the kids can see me, I want them to know it’s not 
over until you say it’s over. It was a choice for me 
tonight – to come out here and live, or to sit at home and die and watch ‘That 70s Show’.” 
Bucket-drummer James Wesson simply 
enjoys hitting things and longs to “bang the drums” during every performance, including the poetry readings. 
“You do seem to go through a catharsis dur -
ing your shows and that’s very entertaining,” 
remarked musician Marc Borsan as he spoke to 
Wesson after the show. 
Poet David Maas, poet, entertained the audi-
ence with one serious and one fun piece in an attempt to “keep things a little bit light.”
“I think the show is a good opportunity for 
people to come out and get their art out to a wider audience,” Maas said. 
“It’s a very eclectic mix of stuff. It’s very 
fun.”

TEEING OFF WITH TOM GREEN� UF LOST NINE TO DRAFT.
By TOM GREEN
Alligator Writer
tgreen@alligator.org
 
We continue our countdown of 
the top 10 teams headed into the 
2010 season with the No. 7 team in the alligatorSports’ preseason poll: the Florida Gators.
The Gators are coming off a sea-
son in which they went 13-1, ending with a 51-24 victory over Cincinnati in the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans.
Despite its second consecutive 
13-win season, and second con-secutive BCS bowl victory, many viewed last season as a relative dis-appointment because Florida failed 
to win the Southeastern Conference 
title and earn a trip to Pasadena, Calif., for the BCS title game.
This year’s team, however, will 
have a very different look to it, both on the field and the sidelines.
Let’s start with the loss of Tim 
Tebow, who was arguably the face of college football for the last three 
years.
In Tebow, the Gators lose a 
dual-threat quarterback who ac-cumulated 9,285 yards through the 
air and nearly 3,000 on the ground in his four years at Florida. But be-yond his statistics, the Gators also 
lose a vocal, emotional leader in the 
three-time Heisman finalist.
Replacing Tebow at quarterback 
is redshirt junior John Brantley, a more traditional dropback passer 
who has been learning the Florida 
offense for three years.
Losing Tebow is huge for Flori-
da, but Brantley should be regard-ed as a more than serviceable heir 
to the offense, so the quarterback 
position shouldn’t be much of a concern.
Instead, on offense, the big-
gest question mark should be the 
unproven receiving corps. The 
Gators lost their top three receiv-
ing targets (in terms of number of 
receptions) from last season’s team in tight end Aaron Hernandez (68 receptions for 850 yards and five touchdowns), wide receiver Riley 
Cooper (51/961/9) and David Nel-
son (25/291/2). Hernandez was drafted in the fourth round by the New England Patriots, Cooper in 
the fifth by the Philadelphia Eagles 
and Nelson went undrafted but signed with the Buffalo Bills.
The Gators will rely on redshirt 
junior Deonte Thompson – who 
was the fourth-leading receiver on 
last season’s team – to step up into one of the voids left behind. Red-shirt senior Carl Moore and red-
shirt freshman Andre Debose, who 
have battled back from back and hamstring injuries, respectively,  as well as redshirt sophomore Omari-
us Hines, will also need be looked 
upon to produce.
Florida is also moving running 
back Chris Rainey, who had 161 
receiving yards and 575 rushing 
yards last season, to the “Percy po-sition,” meaning he will line up as a slot receiver and as a running back.
As for the offensive line, Florida 
returns four of five starters, with Maurkice Pouncey (18th overall pick) being the only one not com-ing back for 2010.
On the other side of the ball, the 
Gators also lost several key pieces to the NFL Draft, most notably cor-nerback Joe Haden, who led the team with four interceptions and 
10 passes broken up.
Aside from Haden, Florida lost 
safety Major Wright, linebackers 
Brandon Spikes and Ryan Stamper (undrafted), and defensive ends 
Carlos Dunlap and Jermaine Cun-ningham.
While those are all key losses on 
defense, the Gators do return safe-ties Ahmad Black and Will Hill and 
cornerback Janoris Jenkins in the defensive backfield. They also get A.J. Jones back at linebacker, where he will be joined by the likes of 
Jelani Jenkins and Jonathan Bostic.On the defensive front, Florida 
will have a rotation of Omar Hunt-
er, Jaye Howard, Lawrence Marsh 
and Terron Sanders at the tackle 
position, and Justin Trattou and true freshman Ronald Powell likely on the ends.
Arguably the biggest loss on

UF redshirt junior quarterback John Brantley takes over the offense this season for the Gators. The big -
gest question on that side of the ball will be which receivers step up as Brantley’s go-to tragets.
No. 7 UF: Brantley looks to fill void left by Tebow
Dear Gainesville, all of Alachua 
County and Independent Florida Alligator supporters, wherever 
you may be today;
You recently found out in a column on 
Tuesday that Tom Green has decided to abandon you to write for the Miami Her-
ald. 
The self-proclaimed “Tom Green 
Show” is taking his writing somewhere 
else. Obviously, I know that all of us are SHOCKED by his decision to desert 
Gainesville and his loyal readers.
But know that I, as sports editor, am 
already in the process of planning the next step to make this the BEST sports 
section in the country. 
I understand your frustration and 
disappointment, but be confident that after this abrupt exit, we at the Inde-pendent Florida Alligator are working harder than EVER to make “The Tom 
Green Show” regret his choice.
The worst part about all of this was 
his “method” of announcing his future 
plans. The Independent Florida Alligator is not meant to be used as a platform to 
advertise your future career plans with 
another newspaper.
We will NOT take this.His cowardly de-
cision to leave will not stop us. Our 
sports section, 
which was named as the best sports sec-tion by the Florida 
Press Association 
last month, will con-tinue on its upward 
path to the top of the journalism world.
We were not notified until two hours 
before the newspapers were inserted into the newsstands. But he didn’t even have the guts to stick the knife in him-self. His best friend gave us a call to let us know.
“The Tom Green Show” will soon be 
taken off the air.
With that, I want to make one guar-
antee to you: “I personally guarantee you that our sports section will win a Hearst 
award before Tom ever does.”
BOOK IT.
Enjoy your day, Gainesville. The sun is 
still shining and Gators football season is just 51 days away.

Yankees fans will forever be thankful for what 
George Steinbrenner did for their team, but Gators 
fans also have reason to be grateful.
He is most remembered for being the outspoken 
owner of the Yankees for the last 38 years and his win-
ning mentality, but “The Boss,” as he was nicknamed, 
also had ties to the University of Florida.
Steinbrenner, who passed away from a heart attack 
in his Tampa home Tuesday at age 80, was a member 
of Gator Boosters, Inc.’s Bull Gator program.
The Bull Gator program, according to the Gator 
Boosters’ website, requires annual contributions of 
at least $14,500 for membership and has been around 
since 1979.
Steinbrenner had been a Bull Gator since 1980, de-
spite never attending the University of Florida.
According to Doug Brown, the associate executive 
director of Gator Boosters, Steinbrenner’s first con-nection to UF was former Florida football coach Ray 
Graves, who became the program’s athletic director 
in 1979.
Graves approached Steinbrenner when the school 
needed help funding the baseball facility, McKethan 
Stadium.“In addition to being a great business man, he was 
a great philanthropist as well,” Brown said. “He was 
not only just a strong supporter of athletics (at UF), but the rest of the university.”
To go with his contributions to the school’s athletic 
program, Steinbrenner also donated to the band build-ing on campus, which is named after him, and the university’s veterinary college, among other things.
Along with being a Bull Gator, Steinbrenner also 
had seats to Florida football games on the Bull Gator 
Deck, which cost $15,500 annually, though Brown said he would only make it to one or two games a sea-son.
“He generally couldn’t get to 
games, in all seriousness he had the Yankees playing in a lot of World 
Series … he really couldn’t get to Gators games until later in the sea-son,” Brown said.
Florida wasn’t the only school that Steinbrenner 
supported. He also contributed to programs at Ohio State and North Carolina.
“It’s a great loss for the university, athletics in par-
ticular, because he was such a strong supporter in a lot of different ways for our university,” Brown said. “He’ll be greatly missed, by a lot of folks, not just here … but all over the sports world.”Steinbrenner had ties to UF
Steinbrenner
defense for the Gators will be that of defensive coordinator 
Charlie Strong, who took the head coaching job at Louisville before the Sugar Bowl. Strong helped turn Florida into a top-
10 defense in four of the last five seasons.
With the exception of the quarterback position, Florida 
has depth at seemingly every spot, and it’s supplemented by 
a plethora of young talent that Urban Meyer and his coaching 
staff (with new additions of defensive coordi-nator Teryl Austin, running backs coach Stan Drayton, linebackers/special teams coach D.J. 
Durkin and wide receivers coach Zach Azzan-
ni) brought in with the No. 2 recruiting class in the nation, according to Rivals.com. Other 
outlets had the class ranked first.
Whether or not Meyer can coach Florida to a third straight 
BCS berth remains to be seen, but the young team certainly 
has the talent to do so. 
It will just be a matter of whether or not that talent in prac-
tice produces in games.Meyer brings in four 
new assistant coaches

With a combined three Na-
tional Championships, eight 
Southeastern Conference Cham-
pionships and three Heisman Trophies, there is plenty to re-member Steve Spurrier, Danny Wuerffel and Tim Tebow by. Just 
in case, the University of Florida 
wants their legacies set in stone. 
The three Heisman winners 
are coming back to the Swamp, 
but they won’t be wearing the 
traditional orange and blue – their new color is bronze.
Florida will pay homage to the 
quarterback legends with three 
larger-than-life statues outside 
Ben Hill Griffin Stadium.
On June 16th, the University 
Athletic Association Board unan-
imously approved the project to 
erect the sculptures. 
According to Chip Howard, 
associate athletics director for op-erations and facilities, the project 
will cost roughly $550,000.
“We have commitments from 
three donors to fully fund the 
project,” Howard said. “No UAA 
or other university funds are be-
ing used.”
The statues will be about 15 
percent larger than life-sized and will be placed on the west side of the stadium where a planter now sits, near the elevators, Howard said.
To prevent people from climb-
ing the statues and possibly get-
ting hurt, a barrier will surround 
the elevated statues.
“It won’t be like the gator 
[statue] on the corner of Gale 
Lemerand [Drive] and Stadium 
[Road],” Howard said. “People will be able to stand in front of them and get pictures, they just won’t be touching the statues.”
The statues will depict the for-
mer quarterbacks in the year they won the Heisman Trophy. While Spurrier and Wuerffel, the 1966 and 1996 Heisman recipients re-spectively, will be captured in a 
throwing motion, there is sus-
pense surrounding how Tebow, the 2007 winner, will be por-trayed.
Spurrier, who was the school’s 
first Heisman winner, threw for 1, 852 yards and 16 touchdowns in 1966 to win the award. 
Wuerffel accumulated 3,319 
yards through the air to rack up 36 touchdowns in his Heisman season. 
Tebow recorded 51 total 
touchdowns (29 passing, 22 rush-ing) and 3,970 total yards in 2007 
to become the latest Gator win 
the trophy.
Howard did not disclose how 
Tebow’s statue would look.
“There were a couple of poses 
looked at for each individual,” he said. “We contacted each person and wanted to make it a collab-orative effort to best represent 
them.”
As for the eye black, Howard said that will be answered at the 
unveiling.
Artist W. Stanley “Sandy” 
Proctor has been commissioned to build the statues. 
The Tallahassee artist sculpted 
former Florida State University 
football coach Bobby Bowden’s 
statue that stands outside FSU’s Doak Campbell Stadium.
Howard said Proctor also did a 
Doak Walker statue in Dallas and has a lot of experience sculpting 
life-like statues.
According to Howard, the in-
stallation of the statues will take 
place sometime after Jan. 1, and 
a ceremony will follow to unveil 
the statues to the public. 
The university is trying to find 
a time for all three honorees to attend, despite their busy sched-
ules.
Currently, the only life-like 
statue on Florida’s campus is of 
Albert A. Murphree, the second 
president of the university.UF to honor Heisman winners with bronze statues

INDIANAPOLIS – March Madness is 
about to get a little bit bigger.
The NCAA unveiled its plans for the 
newly expanded 68-team men’s basket-
ball tournament Monday: Beginning next March, eight teams will play early the 
opening week in a ``First Four’’ round, 
with the winners advancing to games on Thursday or Friday.
Two of the early games will match 
the tournament’s lowest seeds, Nos. 65 
through 68. The other two games will in-
clude the last four at-large qualifiers.
The format appears to be a compromise. Including the lowest at-large teams will probably prevent mid-majors from being 
over-represented in the first round, but it 
could also mean that two teams from big-ger conferences – those generally seeded between 11th and 13th – will be out before the tournament really gets going.
“You’re not going to come up with 
the perfect model,’’ committee chair Dan Guerrero said. “You’re not going to come up with a model that is going to appease 
every constituency out there. But we felt 
that this model provided the opportunity to do something special for the tourna-ment.’’
The NCAA announced in April that it would add three teams to the field, the first expansion since the tournament went from 
64 teams to 65 in 2001 after going from 48 
to 64 in 1985.
It was a hotly debated decision, with 
critics saying the tournament is already as close to perfect as any collegiate champion-
ship can be. Some pointed to Butler’s run to last season’s championship game and 
George Mason’s Final Four run in 2006 as 
examples of parity.
The at-large teams will be seeded 
where they would normally be placed in 
the bracket, meaning a first-round game between two No. 10 seeds would result 
in the winner advancing to play a No. 7 
seed.
“In the end, we selected a format that 
we felt allows us to break new ground,’’ 
Guerrero said. “We are excited about the 
concept of the First Four, and we are re-ally pleased with where we wound up and think that it would add value to the tour-nament as we move forward.’’NCAA unveils expanded 68-team tournament format

NASHVILLE, Tenn. – Saying 
there’s never a good time for a foot-
ball coach to quit, Bobby Johnson re-
tired abruptly Wednesday as the Van-derbilt Commodores’ head coach.
Vice Chancellor David Williams 
announced the news in a post on the university’s athletic website Wednes-day just before a news conference. Minutes later, the 59-year-old John-son stepped up to a podium and said 
he was retiring from college football.
Johnson called it a very difficult 
decision but one not prompted by 
health concerns for either himself or 
his wife. He said he began seriously 
considering retirement a month ago, and he informed Williams in a meet-ing Monday.
“Football is not life, but it’s a way 
of life and it consumes your life,’’ Johnson said. “You only have so many years to live, and you want to see a different way.’’
Johnson’s retirement comes a 
week before he was scheduled to appear at the Southeastern Confer-ence’s preseason media days, nearly three weeks before players report for 
fall practice and just seven weeks be-
fore the Commodores’ opener Sept. 4 against Northwestern.
News leaked out Wednesday 
morning with WGFX-FM 104.5 The 
Zone citing sources that Johnson was 
resigning. That came four hours be-
fore Vanderbilt officials planned to inform the Commodores themselves, so the news conference was hastily 
scheduled. Coaches left reporters to 
speak with players.
“I am saddened by the fact Bobby 
has made this decision,’’ Williams said. “At the same token as I’ve said 
to the staff, it’s our obligation to re-
spect his decision. I did try to talk 
Bobby out of it. I tried to talk him out of it yes-
terday. I tried to talk 
him out of it last night, 
and I tried to talk him out of it this morning.’’
Williams announced that Robbie 
Caldwell will be the interim head coach after serving as assistant head coach. He will be given the chance to keep the job with his performance 
this season.
Asked if he would perform a na-
tional search for a replacement, Wil-
liams said he has a coach now.
“I’m not searching for anything 
other than a victory and a lot of them,’’ Williams said.Vandy coach announces surprising decision to retire

Bobby Johnson announced his retirement as the Vanderbilt head coach Wednesday after eight 
seasons. In 2008 he led the Commodores to their only winning season since 1982.
