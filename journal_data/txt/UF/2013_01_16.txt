The site of “Creature from the 
Black Lagoon,” supposedly escaped 
rhesus monkeys from a Tarzan ﬁ  lm and the Ross Allen Reptile Institute are legacies of Ocala’s Silver Springs. But what the Florida Department of Environmental Protection is cur-rently concerned with preserving is the crystal-clear water.
The department presented a 
draft of its plans to acquire the Silver Springs nature theme park lands and turn them into a Florida state park at an open meeting Monday night.
Following a Dec. 12 meeting 
with about 350 attendees and a ris-ing concern for the water levels and purity of the springs, the proposed plan aims to clean and remove old animal pens and amusement park buildings, set up environmentally sound foundations and make it more nature-focused by opening hiking trails and camping opportu-nities.
“Silver Springs, the attraction, 
has a long history of being exploited for economic beneﬁ  t and not for its natural environmental beneﬁ  ts, and that’s what I don’t want to see with any plans to move forward,” UF ad-junct professor and founder/direc-tor of the Howard T. Odum Florida Springs Institute Robert Knight said at the meeting.
If the plans are approved by Gov . 
Rick Scott and his cabinet, the FDEP will establish a timeline for changes, wrote department representative Jennifer Diaz in an email.
Some attendees Monday were 
worried about what the state planned to do about the employees. Others expressed concerns about the fate of the animals belonging to Palace Entertainment, the current owner of the land lease.

UF’s online graduate business program 
was named the No. 1 program in the state and No. 4 in the nation by U.S. News & World Re-
port Tuesday.
U.S. News publishes standings of online 
education programs by degrees. Based on a survey of criteria that includes graduation rates, faculty credentials and student services sent to hundreds of schools nationwide, 213 institutions were found to have an online mas-ter’s degree program. Of these schools, UF’s Hough Graduate School of Business came in at No. 4.
““It’s a testament to what we do here,” said 
the school’s Senior Associate Dean and Direc-tor S. Selcuk Erenguc. “When you put together the right components, like a world-class facul-ty, a selection process that brings in outstand-ing students and a very dedicated and capable technology team, you end up with a great pro-gram.”UF online graduate program ranks high in US

UF’s Research and Education 
Center began receiving a series of 
unusual specimens Saturday: Bur-mese pythons shot by hunters in South Florida wildlife preserves.
The Ft. Lauderdale-based cen-
ter is a drop-off point where con-testants in the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission-sponsored Python Challenge can turn in their trophies.
FWC spokeswoman Diane 
Hirth said the challenge aims to reduce the species’ presence in Florida.
During the contest, which be-
gan Saturday and lasts until Feb. 10, participants roam through four designated wildlife preserves in South Florida to capture and kill Burmese pythons, which are considered an invasive species in Florida. As part of the contest, the FWC will give cash awards to the two hunters who bring in the lon-gest snake and the most snakes.
As of Tuesday, the center re-
ceived 11 dead snakes, said Frank Mazzotti, director of UF’s Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences’ Wildlife Ecology Department in Ft. Lauderdale.
Mazzotti is working with a 
team of about 12 biologists and students to perform a necropsy on each captured snake.

Dianmarie De Jesus was one of 
about 10,000 students who received 
a mass email from a professor who appeared to be endorsing a new online shopping site for students called uVendors. 
Little did she know, it was a 
concealed promotional strategy broadcast to her in a UF Sakai email by another student.
The 18-year-old co-founders, 
Dakota Woll and Sean Gura, were reported by their peers for solic-iting via email through Sakai on Thursday night. No action has been taken against them. 
“We might have taken a chance 
in sending the emails, but some-times to make a start-up work, you have to take risks,” said Woll, an industrial and systems engineering freshman.
Woll and Gura said they felt 
their unconventional, risky tactic proved to be a success.
“It said that there’s this new site that’s safe and better than Craig-slist. So I was like ‘oh, that’s a good idea.’ I hate posting on Craigslist because I feel like there’s always something that could go wrong,”  said De Jesus, a 19-year-old explor-atory sophomore.
Three days later, De Jesus used 
the site to post her Hewlett-Pack-ard Pavilion G4 laptop for sale. She said she plans to use the site again for future listings.
“The easiest way to describe 
it is a mix between Craigslist and eBay,” Woll said. “It’s like a Face-book group, but it’s much more organized.”
The site prides itself on safety , 
simplicity and savings.
“I originally put [my posting] 
on the huge textbook exchange Fa-cebook page, but it just got buried,” said 18-year-old mathematics and statistics freshman Kaleigh Harder.
Harder said the site’s search 
bar and categories, which include postings for tickets, housing, mo-tor transportation and textbooks, are two features that the Facebook pages lack.
In addition to helping students 
ﬁ  nd what they’re looking for at an affordable, student-determined price, the co-founders said safety is one of their main concerns.
“We’re trying to make it as safe 
for students as possible,” said Gura, a ﬁ  nance freshman. “When you go on the site, you have to register with your uﬂ  .edu email. If you’re not a UF student, you can’t register, and you can’t see the contact infor-mation for products on the site.”
Gura said users can feel safe 
knowing that the uVendors’ com-munity is all around them — in their classes, organizations and clubs.
Gura and Woll said they hope 
the site will eventually create a more uniﬁ  ed campus.

� THE EVENT WILL HOST 
STUDENT-RUN COMPANIES.
HANNAH MORSE

The Center for Entrepreneur-
ship and Innovation teamed 
with the student-run company and blog Hello Perfect to host the ﬁ  rst Entrepreneurs Raid the Plaza from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. to-day on the Plaza of the Ameri-cas.
This event, which is cospon-
sored by Student Government, will give student entrepreneurs the chance to exhibit their com-panies to peers and passers-by.
Because companies and busi-
nesses cannot promote them-selves on campus without UF afﬁ  liation, Hello Perfect found-er, center ambassador and busi-ness administration senior Alexa Carlin and her business partner, public relations senior Angela Ribbler, said they wanted to ﬁ  nd a way for student entrepreneurs to promote themselves and net-work with others.
In an email, Carlin wrote she 
hopes the event will allow peo-ple to learn about student-run UF companies and get inspired to accomplish their dreams.
“These days one can’t wait 
for the phone to ring from em-ployers given the economic situ-ation,” the center’s director, Ja-mie Kraft, wrote in an email.
He also wants the event to 
spark “further momentum and growth in the Gainesville entre-preneurial ecosystem.”   Student entrepreneurs

Wildlife biologist Joy Vinci, 31, said 
the dissections keep the center busy.
The team is collecting the data to 
learn more about the invasive snakes’ presence. Mazzotti said gathering the genetic data is important because it al-lows researchers to distinguish whether a snake is part of the established python population in the wild or a released or escaped pet.
In 2012, the federal government 
banned the importation and interstate sale of the pythons, Hirth said. State law prohibits their possession or sale. She said the largest captured Burmese py-thon documented in Florida was about 17.5 feet.
Mazzotti said he can’t guess how 
many pythons the nearly 1,000 regis-tered participants will capture by the end of the contest.
“If one in 10 catches a snake, that 
would be 100 snakes, and I would be ec-static,” he said.4, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 16, 2013
� COUNTY 
COMMISSIONERS ARE IN TALKS WITH THE RACEWAY TO USE SOME OF ITS HUNDREDS OF ACRES FOR THE COUNTY FAIR.
BREANNA MAYE
Alligator Contributing Writer
The Alachua County 
Fairgrounds may get a new home 
after county commissioners began talk about moving it near a northeast Gainesville racetrack.
Commissioners recently voted 
to start negotiations with the National Hot Rod Association to have the site outside the Auto-Plus Raceway at Gainesville, also known as the Gainesville Raceway, said Mark Sexton, communications coordinator for Alachua County.
Sexton said the raceway, 
11211 North County Road 225, was chosen as the possible new site for the fairgrounds because of its rainwater systems and extra space for parking.
He added that the county 
would save money by having the fairgrounds near the raceway and it could use the savings to maintain the site’s infrastructure.
Rich Schaefer, general 
manager for Auto-Plus, said the idea to move the fairgrounds to the raceway started more than a decade ago. 
It recently proposed to 
share its extra land for the fairgrounds.
The raceway owns about 750 
to 800 acres, he said.
Right now, the negotiations include a financial aspect, Schaefer said. 
It also has to look at what 
commitments the fairgrounds already have in place.
If the fairgrounds moves to 
the site, events at the racetrack won’t be affected, he added.
The negotiations are in the 
beginning stages at this point, but more details should be worked out over the next couple of months, Schaefer said.
Sexton said that once the 
fairgrounds is moved to the raceway, the former site will be used as industrial space.
With talks of moving the 
fairgrounds farther north, getting to the site can be a problem for UF students and residents who rely on public transportation.

route to the speedway. Alachua County Fairgrounds could

They shop at thrift stores, ga-

the 50 states for a unique item that is often unwanted and forgotten.
Nick Prueher and Joe Pickett 
search for abandoned home vid-eos, so they can commentate and make fun of their findings to an au-dience during their Found Footage Festival tour.
For the first time, Prueher and 
Pickett will host the festival in Gainesville at 7:30 p.m. today at The Atlantic, 15 N. Main St.
The duo has collected VHS tapes for the last 20 years and have gath-ered more than 1,000 videos since.
“We have some of the weird-
est, craziest footage we have ever seen,” Prueher said. “We don’t have any footage from Gainesville. So if anyone has found something, bring it to the show.”
The 90-minute show will in-clude exercise tapes, classroom films from the 1970s and a video about how to take care of a ferret, he said.
Prueher said tickets to the show 
cost $5 and can be purchased at the door or online at www.foundfoot-agefest.com.
The group began the Found 
Footage Festival in 2004 by show-ing its tape collection to patrons in New York bars.“People seemed to dig it, and 
we’ve been touring ever since,” Prueher said.
Caroline Garrity, a 19-year-old 
advertising sophomore, said she enjoys making funny videos with her friends and wouldn’t mind sub-mitting her tapes to the festival.
“It would be a good use of $5 to 
get some laughs,” she said. “I wish they would find some of my home videos, because they are spot on.”

Although he and the faculty are thrilled 
with the school’s top ranking, they plan to look 
over evaluations to pinpoint what to improve.
“We pay attention when their methodology 
indicates that some things can be improved upon,” said Associate Provost for Teaching and Technology Andy McCollough.
Also in the report was UF’s online gradu-
ate program in education, which ranked first in Florida and No. 18 nationwide, while the online graduate engineering program was ac-knowledged as No. 26 nationally and second in Florida. Based on the quality of its online bachelor’s degree programs, UF ranked 34 out of 237 American universities.“We have worked really hard to meet the 
needs of today’s learners,” said Associate Dean of Academic Affairs Tom Dana.
The Economist awarded 
its highest grade of “excel-
lent” to UF’s online business program — one of only two in the world to receive it.
“I think it’s affirmation 
of what we believe we’re about, which is trying to produce excellent content with excellent faculty for 
excellent students,”  McCollough said. “It sets a standard for us: Once we have achieved excel-lence, we will not do anything to do less than that. Any programs that have not reached that level know what they have to do to get there.”rankings , from page 1alex Catalano / alligator s taff

Silver Springs is part of one of the largest artesian springs in the world
is very stressful, and during that stressful time they could die, 
and you could be signing their death certificate, really,” Silver Springs zookeeper Wayne Carr said at the meeting. “All I ask is: Take into consideration the animals that are there, even if you just keep them there until they pass.”
Silver Springs is part of the St. Johns River system and is one 
of the largest artesian springs in the world. 
Its flow and environment is influenced by the Rodman Dam, built in 1968 to prepare for the since-scrapped Cross Florida Barge Canal. 
Several argued Monday that the dam should be removed to 
allow the natural environment to recover.
Steven Noll, senior history lecturer at UF and author of 
“Ditch of Dreams: The Cross Florida Barge Canal and the Struggle for Florida’s Future,” disagreed.
“I think, too often, people look at these things by themselves 
instead of looking at the big picture and how it’ll affect the area,” Noll said. “It’s not the panacea some people think it is.”He thinks turning the land into a state park will help, but 
wants to see a decline in nitrate-rich fertilizer usage, better re-claimed water usage and fewer land-use permits for golf cours-es and subdivisions.
Palace Entertainment plans to go forward with planned 
events at the park until definitive action is decided, said Mike Friscia, vice president of the water parks division.
“We will always keep an open mind about what may be the 
best long-term interests of the park, the surrounding commu-nity and the state of Florida in general,” he said. springs , from page 1

� EMPLOYEES WHO WORK ALONG WEST 
UNIVERSITY AVENUE SAID THE BREAK HITS HARD.
CHAD FURST
Alligator Contributing Writer
As students flocked home for the winter holi-
days, their monthlong migration left local restau-
rants with a shortage of customers.
During the winter break, employees who work 
at restaurants along West University Avenue said the gap between Fall and Spring semesters is a challenge.
“All of December, and even into January, is re-
ally slow for us,” said Risa Sternfield, a bartender at Beef ‘O’ Brady’s on West University Avenue. “Breakfast, lunch and dinner are all affected.”
During the Fall, the restaurant can make as 
much as $2,000 a night. 
In December, however, Sternfield said, the res-
taurant makes a fraction of that amount.
David Mocilan, a bartender at the Copper 
Monkey Restaurant & Pub, said he can normally make about $200 a night in tips but struggles to make half of that amount when students are out of town.
“It’s usually locals — students that don’t have to go home,” he said.
Some restaurants prepare for the slow busi-
ness. At Leonardo’s Pizza by the Slice, cooks don’t prepare as much food, and employees go home early if there are no customers. 
The Copper Monkey closes its doors for days 
at a time, including the week of Christmas and on New Year’s Day.
Despite the number of local residents who 
stayed in town during the winter break, most res-taurants were still hit hard.
“Sales drop by about 40 percent,” said Greg 
Smith, co-manager of Papa John’s Pizza on West University Avenue.
Catherine Hapler, co-manager with Smith at 
Papa John’s, said she knows how slow business can be without students on campus.
“I can deliver for seven hours and only make 
$10 in tips,” she said.
When classes start back up at UF, business is 
back to normal for the restaurants.
Chris Milligan, an employee at Wing Zone, 
said business with students is crucial.
“We are very UF-dependent,”  he said.Lack of students during winter break

The classic fight for Monopoly pieces reached a new level 
when Hasbro announced that the board game would change 
its iconic metal tokens, which identify players in the game.
Hasbro is using Facebook to decide which pieces stay and 
which go straight to jail without collecting $200. The campaign runs until Feb. 5.
The company is using a specialized Facebook app through 
the Monopoly fan page to generate votes. Users can vote on which classic piece they 
wish to save, and which new one should take its place.
Steve Johnson, visual coordinator for the 
College of Journalism and Communications, 
has extensive experience with social media and networking.
“Social media can be used for two things: 
consuming and creating. So I think they’re using it as someone who is trying to find 
who their audience is,” Johnson said. “They are using crowd-sourcing to figure out what the masses think.”
Anel Henry thinks the game is fun as it is.“They already have so many different versions of the game, 
I don’t see why it is necessary to change the pieces,” the 18-year-old biology freshman said.
Freshman biology major Nicole Palmero, 19, doesn’t see the 
correlation between the pieces in the first place.
“A thimble? A dog? What difference does it make — they 
don’t make any sense as it is,” she said.
It’ll be a roll of the dice whether fans embrace the new 
changes to the timeless game.Hasbro uses social media to decide new Monopoly token

Recruitment week is back. 
Interfraternity Council rush 
began Monday and lasts through Friday.
Twenty-two fraternities 
are registered for recruitment, said Justin Shifrin, a 19-year-old accounting sophomore and director of public relations for the Interfraternity Council.
Shifrin said he hopes the 
students who choose to rush will gain a sense of camaraderie and networking opportunities.
“Every fraternity offers 
something different and has a different history,” he said. “I hope students get a chance to decide to join a fraternity and gain in the experience.”For the remainder of the week, 
Shifrin said, recruitment begins at 11 a.m. with lunch, and then, depending on the fraternity house, dinner will be between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m.
Each night there will be an 
event, which begins at 8 p.m. and lasts till 11 p.m.
For fraternities that do not have 
houses, events will be at Flavet Field, Shifrin said.He said IFC has used Facebook 
and Twitter to get the word out about recruitment events. 
So far, Shifrin said, the turnout 
has been “amazing.”
“From what I’ve been able to 
see, it’s been going great so far,” 
he said.
Zac Laczko, a 20-year-old 
political science junior and vice president of Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity, said he hoped students visit every house to be sure of what they want.
“Every house has great things 
to offer,” he said.
Aiden Kocarek, an 18-year-
old advertising freshman, said he rushed in the Fall but decided to try again this semester.

OPINIONS EDITORToday’s question: Do you think Silver Springs should 
become a state park? 
45 TOTAL VOTES30% YES
70% NOTuesday’s question: Have you seen the Doritos commercial?America’s age of objectivity has ended
Last Monday , Alabama rolled — quite literally — over 
Notre Dame, crushing the Fighting Irish 42-14, becom-ing the third team to win three national titles in four 
seasons. As a UF student, I’d like to say: Congratulations, Alabama. You’ve earned it — like Louisville.
I’d also like to recognize ESPN commentator Brent Mus-
burger for saying what the rest of us would have said (or Tweeted, or Instagrammed), had we seen someone as beauti-ful as Katherine Webb. 
Let me explain.During the game, a camera caught sight of Alabama 
quarterback AJ McCarron’s girlfriend, Webb, a former Miss Alabama USA, standing in the crowd, as she watched her boyfriend win Alabama’s second-straight national title.    Turning to his colleague Kirk Herbstreit, Musburger jocular-ly remarked, “You quarterbacks, you get all the good looking women. What a beautiful woman. Wow! Whoa!”
His partner added, “AJ’s doing some things right down 
in Tuscaloosa.”
Musburger playfully ﬁ  red back, “So if you’re a young-
ster at Alabama, start getting the football out, and throw it around with Pop.”
Somewhere, a feminist died. Faster than LeBron James 
could follow the ravishing 23-year-old on Twitter, people re-sponded to the innocuous banter with juvenile outrage. As the New York Times reported, commentary on the broadcast following the game included words like “creepy,” “awk-ward,” “uncomfortable” and “heteronormative.”
The article went on to say, “‘It’s extraordinarily inappro-
priate to focus on an individual’s looks,’ said Sue Carter, a professor of journalism at Michigan State . . .  ‘I think there’s a generational issue, but it’s incumbent on people practicing in these eras to keep up and this is not a norm.’”
Not a norm, huh? I wouldn’t be surprised if her doctrinal 
thesis was titled, “Retrograde Sexual Objectiﬁ  cation in Cul-tural Identity.” But who am I to judge the judgmental?
As our culture embraced tolerance with open, tattooed 
arms, we witnessed a wave of repressive idiocy and banal demagoguery that triﬂ  es our capacity to think narrow-mind-edly and objectively. This senseless shift resulted in our so-ciety practicing mental gymnastics in order to accommodate the fatu-ous demands of the open-minded.
The age of objectivity is over. 
Truth is relative, all beliefs are equal and any effort to explain reality is limited by the progres-sive, liberal agenda that censures those who espouse truth — even if they’re truthful!
College admissions decisions place more emphasis on 
achieving diversity than maintaining the students who ex-emplify superior academic qualiﬁ  cations. Employers are more concerned with your ablility to provide an explanation that elucidates your understanding of empathy than your knowledge of the ﬁ  eld. That’s why those who call them-selves tolerant lambast people like Musburger. By operating under the rubric of open-mindedness, the terrorants (tolerant + terrorists) tolerate everything — except for what they don’t tolerate, which is everything!
As long as your perception of reality runs in ideological 
lockstep with these people, you’re ﬁ  ne. Going on a political rant about gun control during Sunday Night Football is ﬁ  ne, as long as you’re not on the sidelines praying to the Judeo-Christian God of the Bible or bantering about beautiful wom-en in the crowd.
We live in a world characterized by a fundamental group 
who is easily offended by everything, invariably devaluing any instance of being legitimately offended. Acceptance has replaced right and wrong. Words have replaced the notion of sticks and stones.
Last Thursday , my editors at the Alligator pointed out: 
“There is nothing more admirable than standing up for what you truly believe in, despite what adversity you might face.”
That’s true — unless, of course, you don’t believe in what 
they truly believe.
Where the hell is this country going?Erik Skipper is an economics sophomore at UF. His column 
runs on Wednesdays.We Get It: 
You’re all very 
angry because you 
can’t read
Welcome, new readers! We’re so glad you decided 
to pick up — or click on — our humble publica-tion.
Here at the Alligator, we welcome criticism, feedback 
and communication from our readers.
Imagine our surprise when we gained so many new fans 
this week; we don’t normally get such national attention from all of you. It’ll take a few years to clean out our email inboxes and to cool our receptionist’s phone after she ﬁ  eld-ed all of your calls.
Quite a few of you were up in arms, so to speak, over 
Dallin Kelson’s column Monday, titled, “Loganville woman jumped the gun.”
The main point of the article was not a moral discussion 
of whether a mother should protect her children, which is what many of you appear to believe.
We understand how you could disagree with one of our 
opinions columnists because, as you can imagine, everyone has a different opinion.
Could we brieﬂ  y deﬁ  ne what an opinion is for you? 
Thank you!
An opinion is deﬁ  ned as “a view or judgment formed 
about something, not necessarily based on fact or knowl-edge” or, “the beliefs or views of a large number or majority of people about a particular thing.”
An opinion isn’t news, and it doesn’t reﬂ  ect the views of 
this newspaper.
OK, now that we’ve got that out of the way, we can delve 
into the other bigger issue surrounding the response to this column: literacy.
Literacy is deﬁ  ned as “the ability to read and write.”Reading can be difﬁ  cult. As college students, our text-
books are often confusing and full of words and ideas that require more than one glance.
What many of you encountered is an article that may 
have taken you more than one reading to fully understand.
Crazy, right?Perhaps we need to write our columns in a more linear 
fashion for those of you who have trouble understanding concepts.
The point of Kelson’s column was to say that, perhaps 
if the woman had opened the door, the entire violent and physical altercation could have been avoided.
That’s all.

SEE EDDY, PAGE 7 WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 16, 2013  ALLIGATOR, 7
Isn’t it about time to reinstate 
the draft?
I would think no one 
would consider such a policy reversal, but unfortunately , that’s what the former com-mander of American forces in Afghanistan, Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, believes we should do.
On Sunday, McChrystal told Bob Schieffer on CBS’s 
“Face the Nation” that he believed “national service is im-portant for the nation, and that’s having all young people serve a term of national service.” 
He’s not exclusively calling for military service, but he 
believes young Americans should do something to serve their country that does not involve personal gain.
In a column for the Daily Beast, McChrystal argued, 
“When America needs it, national service is the personal obligation of every American.” He contends that with our inalienable rights, outlined in our founding documents, Americans have “inalienable responsibilities.”
From where do these inalienable responsibilities origi-
nate? He doesn’t say . But don’t worry . McChrystal later says, this new national service program would be “volun-tary (but expected),” — whatever that means.
He fails to specify how this program, unlike an actual 
military draft, would be voluntary. Then again, we are told that we “voluntarily” pay our taxes as well. So this could just be Orwellian doublespeak.
Young people should be wary of politicians and public 
ﬁ  gures who call for reinstituting a draft or national service program. Historically, calls to nationalism and an obliga-tion to one’s country do not turn out well.
Morally, the idea that one owes anything to the nation 
in which they are born by the mere accident of their birth is repugnant and contrary to the founding principles of the U.S.
When President James Madison tried to institute the 
draft during the War of 1812, he immediately faced op-position. In a speech delivered on the ﬂ  oor of the House of Representatives, Massachusetts Sen. Daniel Webster rightly asked, “Is [conscription], Sir, consistent with the character of a free government? Is this civil liberty? Is this the real character of our Constitution? No, Sir, indeed it is not.” 
In other words, how is requiring national service con-
sistent with the ideas of liberty?
During the Civil War, although most men in Union 
states signed up voluntarily , the draft ﬁ  rst called to arms many men who did not wish to ﬁ  ght. Forcing men to ﬁ  ght and die against their wills while simultaneously con-demning slavery deﬁ  es all logic.
Regardless, the draft became a staple of American mili-
tary history until the Vietnam War. The needless deaths of young men who did not wish to ﬁ  ght in conﬂ  icts that had nothing to do with defending American sovereignty (e.g., World War I and Vietnam) illustrates just how im-moral and burdensome conscription can be when taken to its extreme.
How easy it must be for McChrystal to call upon to-
day’s youth and demand they pursue national service.
Yes, McChrystal served throughout the world for the 
U.S. as a long-time member of the armed services. But just because he chose a path of service does not give him the moral authority to demand everyone else also serve in some capacity.
Will public ofﬁ  cials heed McChrystal’s call for national 
service? Probably not.
However, it is important to reﬂ  ect on how disastrous 
such a policy can be.
Young people should stand up to bullies who demand 
we sacriﬁ  ce our liberty or even our lives for a government that continues to pile on the debt for us and future genera-tions — or any government for that matter.

opinions@alligator.orgEveryone has opinions: Columnists for 
the Alligator express them in this section
The Alligator’s Opinions editor is a woman who is 
often home alone and, in fact, rarely answers the door 
unless she knows a pizza is on its way. She understands not wanting to open the door for strangers and jumps when a UPS delivery person knocks at the door — every time.
It’s an assumption, admittedly, to think that if the rob-
ber in that news story had thought someone was home, he wouldn’t have entered the house.
We still think of criminals as those two buffoons in 
“101 Dalmations” who sneak around harmlessly. Maybe the burglar in this case was a bit more menacing than those fools and would have broken in regardless of evi-dence that someone was home.
Did he knock on the door with his crowbar in hand? 
Probably not.
Burglars aren’t like certain Mormon youth; there’s no 
uniform.
However, we’re allowed the beneﬁ  t of the doubt 
when writing an opinions piece.
Would you like to know why?It’s our opinion.Whether it’s God-given or man-made, opinions are 
like climate change; they are real.
Opinions are like a rumbling belly; they can poten-
tially annoy us before we do something about them.
Opinions are like dogs in a car with the windows 
down; they can give us a sense of fulﬁ  llment.
Opinions are like Cheeto dust on ﬁ  ngers; they can be 
something to savor.
Opinions are like gun control; they can snowball into 
a way bigger issue than they need to be.
In one of the dozens of emails we received this week, 
someone said: “I let my membership to the NRA lapse a couple of years ago. I think it is time to rejoin and may-be buy another ﬁ  rearm before dumbasses like you and Obama take away that right.”
Sir, no one is here to take away your guns. Also, can 
you help us meet Obama? If we’re supposed to be part-ners in crime with him, we’d have to be buddies ﬁ  rst.
No one here is arguing for people to not own guns.Wouldn’t it be cool, though, if we didn’t have to use 
them in our own homes in front of our children while we shot a man multiple times?
Now that we’re on the subject of the emails we re-
ceived, let’s discuss literacy one more time.
Nearly all of you, while criticizing the writing of our 
columnist, made typos of your own.
If you’re going to pick a ﬁ  ght with a newspaper, spell your insults correctly.
“Your” and “you’re” are two very different words.If you think we’re coming to take your guns, think 
again. We’re coming to put you back in school. So many children seem to have been left behind, indeed.
Neal Boortz, if you’re reading this, then you could 
have at least spelled our columnist’s name correctly in your ﬁ  rst tweet regarding this issue. We understand typ-ing can be difﬁ  cult if you’re too busy fanning ﬂ  ames to do it correctly.
Are we perfect?Absolutely not.Are we entitled to our own opinion on things? You betcha, don’t cha know.There’s no need to spur on your ignorant followers to 
attack someone simply because you disagree with them.
“But there’s no privacy on the Internet,” all of you 
scream, with pitchforks made of iPhones and bacon gripped in your greasy hands.
However, dear new readers, there is a difference be-
tween a civil disagreement and egregious, misdirected and blind hatred.
Is it because words in the Bible are spelled funny? Is 
that why you can’t correctly spell out your arguments?
You are hilariously misinformed if you believe, for 
two seconds, that our columnists — or any other decent human beings — raised the burglar in Loganville to some sort of hero-status pedestal of worship. 
We’re not pro-robbery. We, in fact, wish that he never 
tried to break into any house, ever.
The argument our columnist made was that a man 
wouldn’t have to be shot in front of children if we didn’t live in a society that runs to its gun cabinets ﬁ  rst.
Again, this editor completely understands being too 
worried to open a door for a stranger and couldn’t begin to fathom what she would have done in that situation.
None of you could, either. Or ...“Oh, I’d grab my handgun,” you drawl, “all while 
keeping up with the game on TV, as I am a red-blooded American.”
Cool. Awesome.That doesn’t make us feel any better, and it perpetu-
ates our terrible gun-ﬁ  rst fear mongering society.
We understand that we’ll never get back to a time 
when we can live in glorious suburbia with latchkey children (not necessarily a great time to live, anyway, if you were a woman or a minority, but that’s for another time).
There’s no need to attack anyone, whether it’s for his 
or her opinion or to get into a family’s home.
We get it.EDDY , from page 6

� THE NEW YEAR 
BROUGHT CONTROVERSY IN CHINESE NEWSPAPER.
BETHANY SCHUSTER
Alligator Contributing Writer
As a daughter of a Commu-
nist Party member, a 24-year-
old Chinese UF student believes freedom of press is far from China’s horizon. Her name has been withheld for security.
Southern Weekly is consid-
ered the most inﬂ  uential news-paper to the liberal intellectuals of mainland China, said Tianle Zhang, a 24-year-old public re-lations graduate student.
Each year, the paper releas-
es a New Year’s Eve issue. This year’s editorial brought tumult, vexation and discourse. The editorial, “China’s Dream, the Dream of Constitutionalism,” was a nod to a speech by the new party leader, Xi Jinping. He spoke of putting the “Chinese Dream” into practice, which he explained to be a more demo-cratic government. The original content supporting liberalized press endured a series of cuts until it became a political ediﬁ  -cation of the party.
Representatives of the Cen-
tral Propaganda Department are assigned publications to edit. But is unusual for them to publish their edits to the con-tent without the editors’ con-sent, according to an article by China Media Project. The incident snowballed 
into a written request from Southern Weekly journalists for the resignation of the ofﬁ  cial held responsible for the edits.
The tagline of the Guang-
zhou-based paper is “to under-stand China,” but now some Chinese UF students wonder if the paper has lost its voice.
Jing Jin, a 24-year-old jour-
nalism graduate student, said when she came to America, she was excited about the free press. But she said the U.S. has its own form of censorship.
“It may not be controlled by 
the government, but it is con-trolled by big companies who have the money to invest in programs,” she said.
Juan-Carlos Molleda, direc-
tor of the UF Master of Art in Mass Communication - Global Strategic Communication pro-gram, said that in the past, the Chinese government controlled the ﬂ  ow of information by us-ing the concept of harmony.
“For them, a society that is 
harmonious does not have con-ﬂ  ict,” Molleda said.
For now, Chinese censor-
ship is viewed as an obstacle, and students have embraced that reality.
Originally from Taiwan, 
Ming-Yu Yen is a 23-year-old public relations graduate stu-dent who, like many Chinese 20-somethings, believes censor-ship won’t stand in the way of information.

said, “we will break it.”International students

A Florida National Guard soldier 
died Tuesday in Gainesville after 
he lost control of his Hummer and crashed on Highway 301 in Brad-ford County.
The incident happened at about 
11:30 a.m., when Arandall Ladarrion Shears, 20, of West Point, Ga., was driving in the left lane on Highway 301, north of Lawtey . 
Shears lost control of his vehicle, 
according to a Florida Highway Pa-trol report. The Hummer veered into a grass median and ﬂ  ipped over, throwing Shears from the truck. He was not wearing a seatbelt.
Drivers near the accident stopped and gave Shears CPR before Brad-ford County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce, Camp Blanding Joint Training Center and Florida Highway Patrol ofﬁ  cials ar-rived at the scene.
National Guard spokesman Sgt. 
Thomas E. Kielbasa said an ambu-lance drove Shears to a hospital in Starke, where a helicopter ﬂ  ew him to Shands at UF for treatment.

To create public conversations 
about reducing violence in com-
munities, a UF graduate launched a national video anti-bullying cam-paign.
The documentary , “Coexist,” 
shares stories from survivors of the 1994 Rwandan genocide, and the grief that comes with coexisting with their loved ones’ murderers.
“It’s important for someone to 
see a different path than revenge or retribution,” said Coexist Director Adam Mazo.
American Public Television se-
lected “Coexist” to be distributed to public television stations across the country, reaching a potential audi-ence of more than 100 million.
In an effort to raise money for 
technical improvements before it broadcasts, Coexist launched a cam-paign earlier this month on www.in-diegogo.com to raise $20,000. How-ever, if  the campaign doesn’t get all the donations by Feb. 3, the program will receive no funds. As of press time, it had raised about $7,500.
Mazo, who graduated in 2002 
with a bachelor’s degree in journal-ism, said he does not know when it will broadcast, but he expects the documentary to air by May.
He said he conceived the idea 
for the documentary after a trip to 
Rwanda in 2006 when he met 
Agnes, a Rwan-dan woman who suffered horrific attacks and lost three children.
“She decided 
to forgive the peo-ple who harmed 
her,” he said. “I was so moved. I felt like I needed to get her story out to the world, and that this was the way I could contribute.”
Since the premiere of the docu-
mentary in 2010, “Coexist” has been in a dozen film festivals, nominated for an Africa Movie Academy Award and used as a teaching tool by about 3,000 educators, Mazo said.As part of a Boston-based edu-
cational documentary film project, “Coexist” comes with a free, four-lesson teachers guide, which Mazo said helps students and adults think about issues of reconciliation and solutions to stopping those kinds of behaviors.
“Our mission became more de-
fined to working with young people to create opportunity for public con-versations about each person’s role in conflict,” he said. “So together, we can find solutions to bullying and violence that is embedded in our culture.”
Suzanne Tzuanos, a third-year 
UF law student and producer of “Coexist,” said it is impossible to see the film and not want to talk about it afterward.
“It’s more than a documentary ,” 
she said. “Bringing mindfulness and awareness to children is so impor -
tant; this gives them the tools they need to think about the future before they act.”

The Alachua County Super -
visor of Elections will handle 
all its election operations under one roof if it moves to a new of-fice later this year.
The office, which has 
three locations throughout Gainesville, will consolidate into one space, said Supervisor of Elections Pam Carpenter.
The deadline for the move is 
Dec. 1, just in time for the 2014 city elections, Carpenter said.
So far, six proposals have 
been submitted. The 5440 Group LLC submitted a sug-gestion for a building on North-west 13th Street. Saul Silber Properties LLC recommended moving into the old Sticks ‘N’ Stuff building at the corner of Northwest 13th Street and Northwest 23rd Avenue.
The new location would pro-
vide extra space for new voting equipment required by Florida law for the 2016 election. Resi-dents will vote on touch-screen machines that will print out pa-per ballots, Carpenter said.
Alachua County Purchasing 
Manager Larry Sapp said the county is looking for a build-ing that is at least 40,000 square feet, close to bus routes and has enough parking space.
The new location could also 
offer additional space for other county departments.Supervisor of Ele ctions

When Casey Prather suffered 
a high left ankle sprain late in the 
first half Saturday against LSU, Florida’s depth on the wing took a blow.
But in the junior forward’s ab-
sence, freshman shooting guard Michael Frazier II picked up the slack. 
In a season-high 31 minutes, 
Frazier scored only 5 points on 1-of-5 shooting but tallied career bests with seven rebounds and three assists in the No. 10 Gators’ 74-52 victory against the Tigers.  
“The older guys tell [the fresh-
men] all the time (that) we just have to be ready to step in,” Fra-zier said. “The coaches told us before the season that somebody might go down.” 
Frazier’s effort on the glass 
helped Florida outrebound LSU 53-34 — tied for UF’s second-largest rebounding margin this season. 
The Tampa native entered the 
game with 14:40 remaining in the first half and subbed out for only three short breaks. He started the second half in Prather’s spot and played the final nine minutes of the contest.
With Prather likely sidelined 
for 10 to 14 days, Frazier should see a bigger role in the rotation.
Frazier has usually been one of 
the first players to come off UF’s bench. He averages 17.6 minutes per game – seventh best on the team and highest among fresh-men. 
“My role is going to improve 
now because Casey got hurt,” Fra-zier said. “That’s why I work so hard in practice, so I’ll be ready for opportunities like this.” 
Frazier, who averages 5.7 points 
per contest, has so far pieced to-gether a efficient season offen-sively. 
The freshman spot-up shooter 
is making 42.9 percent of his shots from three-point range — second best on the team behind senior for-ward Erik Murphy’s 43.6-percent clip. 
Frazier has also made 14 of 15 
free throws. He has an offensive rating of 125, which is 70th in the nation, according to KenPom.com. 
The 6-foot-4 Frazier’s ability to 
rebound at multiple positions has also been a bonus for the Gators.
He averages 3.3 rebounds per game and his 19.2 defensive re-bounding percentage is second best on the team behind junior for-ward Will Yeguete’s 21.4 percent.
“When we’ve gone with more 
of a conventional lineup, Michael Frazier proved to be a better re-bounder than maybe anybody anticipated,” coach Billy Donovan said.
“Frazier has proven, when he 
goes to the small forward spot, he’s a good rebounder. … That’s been something that has helped us.”
Despite showing prowess on 
the boards and behind the arc, Fra-zier still has to improve his deci-sion-making.   
After UF’s victory against LSU, 
Donovan pointed out a mental er-ror the freshman made against the Tigers. 
“We’re up by [22 points], and 
it’s one pass up the sideline and he takes a challenged three,” Donovan said. “It leads to a run-out layup. Then five of our next [eight] pos-sessions, we turn the ball over.” 
Florida will need Frazier to grab 
rebounds and knock down shots against Texas A&M on Thursday night and against No. 17 Missouri on Saturday afternoon.
“We’re going to need him to 
come provide energy, defense, good decisions, just be able to run our offense the same,” junior cen-ter Patric Young said.
“(We’re) not telling him to be 
as athletic and do the things Casey does, but just to go out there and play within himself.”

the UF gymnastics team are working on correcting mistakes after Friday’s loss to LSU.See story, page 15.

The lasting image from Florida’s near 
upset of No. 9 Tennessee was the an-
guished look on the face of freshman Christin Mercer. 
Mercer, who played 21 minutes in 
place of an injured Jennifer George during Sunday’s 78-75 overtime loss to the Vol-unteers, had the opportunity to give the Gators the lead with nine seconds remain-ing in overtime. 
Following coach Amanda Butler’s deci-
sion to foul Tennessee’s Kamiko Williams the previous possession — Williams made 1 of 2 free throws to give the Volunteers a 76-75 lead with 24 seconds left — Mercer worked herself into position near the rim and was fouled by Jasmine Jones while at-tempting a shot. 
But Mercer missed 
both attempts from the foul line, and Florida’s 
upset bid was spoiled. 
Two days later, the 
frustration of failure in the game’s waning mo-ments against the Vol-unteers was still written 
across Mercer’s face. 
However, she expressed an understand-
ing that there was a lesson to be learned from the experience. “Honestly, still now, the free throws 
kind of hurt,” Mercer said.
“But I did take a step forward. I played 
well, especially with Jennifer out. As a team, we all progressed. By myself, I took a couple of steps forward.” 
Mercer made only 3 of 9 field goal at-
tempts and shot just 1 of 4 from the free-throw line. 
But the freshman showed toughness 
and a willingness to battle inside against Tennessee’s Bashaara Graves.
Toughness in the paint is something 
Mercer lacked early in the season, but she is beginning to relish the responsibility. 
“At first, I didn’t like being a post play-
er,” Mercer said.“[George] just helped me out by show-
ing me what I can do and how great I can be.” 
Florida needs Mercer to continue her 
rapid development. 
George suffered a second dislocation of 
her right shoulder with 3:56 remaining in the first half and did not return.
With no remaining eligibility after this 
season, George is forced to play through the pain or simply sit out and rest the in-jury.
Either way, George will be playing at 
less than 100 percent for the remainder of the season.
“Having Jennifer down is unfortunate 
for us, but it’s definitely not something that we are hanging our heads about and thinking our season is done,” redshirt

sophomore Kayla Lewis said. 
Mercer is averaging 5.9 
points and 3.5 rebounds in 
17.2 minutes per game this season but will be asked to do more to help offset the loss of George.
She is a key piece on Flori-
da’s productive bench.
In four conference games, 
the Gators reserves are aver -
aging 24.5 points per game. Opponents have averaged just 6.25 points off the bench dur -
ing that time.
UF outscored UT 33-3 in 
bench points on Sunday.
“We don’t bring subs in off 
the bench; we bring in a new wave of attack,” Butler said. “That’s the way we look at it, and that’s one of the reasons we don’t put a lot of emphasis on who starts.”
Butler and her coaching 
staff believe Mercer can use the down performance against Tennessee to further her de-velopment.
“Christin — even though 
she missed a lot of shots she wishes she had back — I think she woke up this morning knowing she took a step in the right direction,” Butler said on Monday.
“(We have) a lot more con-
fidence in her than we had to be in certain game situations. Going forward, I hope that we will see that more consis-tently.”

With shoulder pads 
strapped, life jackets snapped 
and hockey masks fit snuggly, Cameron Martin and his old-er brother, Adam, prepared for battle in the backyard.
As one brother grasped 
the football, the other would gear up to make the tackle. That’s how it was growing up with Adam. 
“He’s a pretty big influ-
ence,” Cameron said. “Child-hood memories were he and I competing. I definitely attri-bute a lot of my competitive-ness to our relationship.”
Adam went to UCF to play 
soccer. Two years later, Cam-eron went to UF thanks to a different talent. 
Now a four-time All-
American and a senior at Florida, Martin is trying not to think about graduation in May.
Instead, his focus is on 
finishing his last season on a high note.
“Perspective for me 
changed about, ‘What does it mean to go hard? What does it mean to go fast?’” Martin said about his transition to swimming at Florida. “Ev-ery time we go to the blocks, we’re expected to be good.” 
Martin said that it was a 
difficult decision to become a Gator because he was heavily considering attending Har -
vard. Florida’s prestige under coach Gregg Troy made Mar -
tin’s decision easier. Martin also praised UF’s academic reputation for helping him suit up in orange and blue. 
“Looking back now, I ap-
preciate the fact that I can go to school, I can get educated,” he said. “(I’m) definitely glad that I made, in my opinion, the right choice.”  
As a freshman, he strug-
gled to balance swimming with his schoolwork, a hurdle he wasn’t used to at Clearwa-ter Central Catholic High. Martin said he remembers sacrificing sleep to do home-work, knowing he had to wake up early for practice.
When he 
isn’t swim-ming, he likes to try new things. Martin said he loves arts and crafts and even learned to 
sew. He fashioned his own sports jacket because he wanted to save money. Mar -
tin’s days as a Gators swim-mer are dwindling, but he has a loose outline for what he’ll do post-graduation. He said he hopes to get an in-ternship with Nike Inc. or work for IDEO, a design and innovation-consulting firm. 
Martin will cherish his 
time as a Gators swimmer.
“I loved every minute of 
it,” Martin said

diving team will head to Dal-las on Friday for the SMU Classic.

Inside Florida’s newly renovated $4.3 million prac-
tice facility, the gymnasts mean business. 
Losing by a margin of 0.3 points to LSU on Friday 
in the season’s first road meet left a sour taste in the 
team’s mouth, but the loss has pushed UF to perform more aggressively. 
“In practice we’ve been focusing on going big on 
everything and not holding anything back,” Ashanee Dickerson said. “You can’t hold back on your skills. Some people will go small just to stay on the beam, and sometimes that’s where you’ll make mistakes.”
During Friday’s meet, uncharacteristic misses by 
freshman Bridget Sloan and All-American Marissa King forced the Gators to count a fall towards their beam to-tal for the first time since the 2011 NCAA Champion-ships. Sloan was participating in the event for the first time at the college level.
The defeat was Florida’s first regular-season loss 
since Feb. 3, 2012, against Alabama. 
“It’s better to have it over and done with right now 
because now we know that we can only go up from here,” Dickerson said.
Coach Rhonda Faehn noted a rise in energy since the 
Gators returned to Gainesville. 
“We’ve really had some great practices,” Faehn said. 
“Sunday was very motivational and we studied our film footage, and of course they weren’t thrilled with their performances in total. They’ve really trained ag-gressively, and yesterday was another positive training practice.”
Kytra Hunter, a quiet leader, has been more vocal 
this week.
“We came in this week to fix little mistakes — more stuck landings or straight legs and pointed toes,” Hunt-er said. 
Hunter also applauded the efforts of junior Macken-
zie Caquatto, who suffered a fall on one of her signature events — uneven bars.
Still, Caquatto came back to record a score of 9.95 — 
UF’s season-best total — to claim the evening’s balance beam title. 
Caquatto was one of three Gators to share the team’s 
high mark of 9.95 in 2012. Both Caquatto and Alaina Johnson advanced to the NCAA bar final last season. 
“After the meet, Rhonda was saying that mistakes 
like that [are] something she wants to see — us trying to be the best,” Hunter said. 
Faehn noted that the lack of stuck landings and 
handstand misses on bars contributed to Florida’s loss. 
The addition of HD video recorders and monitors at 
each work station will provide instant feedback. With a loss looming over the program, Faehn is confident the new features will be useful. 
“It’s amazing because our athletes are able to visual-
ize and actually see what they did wrong, and it helps reinforce corrections,” Faehn said.

THE RALLY
Greg Luca

Adam Pincus
twitter: @AdamDPincus  Greg: With fans and scouts ogling Florida’s 
early entrants to the NFL Draft, few have no-ticed the players UF loses to graduation. 
  While mostly unspectacular, the class 
of 2012 was solid, and the Gators will miss many of its key players.
  Although Josh Evans led the team in tack-
les and Mike Gillislee carried the offense, Omar Hunter will prove most difﬁ  cult to re-place. 
  At 6 feet and 313 pounds, Hunter anchored 
the nation’s No. 4 rush defense. Although he made only 40 tackles and four tackles for loss, his ability to start every game and eat space on the line made life easier for the rest of the defense. And he did it while bearing a strik-ing and lovable resemblance to the father ﬁ  g-ure in the animated children’s show “Dino-saurs.” You don’t just replace that.
  Adam: Hunter did have a hell of a year. He 
became a father late in the season and is per-haps the nicest player on the team. He’s no Evans, though. Leading Florida in tackles is more impressive. The safety recorded 83 tackles, 4.5 tackles for loss, 2.5 sacks and 3 in-terceptions. Evans approached the coaching staff in the offseason asking for help on mak-ing defensive calls. 
  Teamed with junior safety Matt Elam, Ev-
ans prevented plays from turning into what Muschamp calls “explosives.” Florida doesn’t have the same depth from at safety that it has along the defensive line. Muschamp did bring in three safeties with his latest star-studded recruiting class, but there isn’t the same re-turning talent in the defensive backﬁ  eld that the defensive line boasts. Returning players Dante Fowler Jr., Jonathan Bullard and Dominique Easley will give quarterbacks hell for another sea-son. There is also an early enrollee freshman named Darious “Bear” Cummings. You try running against a bear, Luca. It just doesn’t work.
  Greg: First off, if you see me ﬁ  ghting a bear, 
you better jump in and help the bear. 
  Just because Cummings has a cool name 
and weighs 305 pounds doesn’t mean he’s ready to anchor a Southeastern Conference defense on the majority of its snaps. The same goes for 304-pound recruit Caleb Brantley. As Muschamp is fond of saying, transitioning to the strength and physicality of the SEC is a daunting task, especially for line-of-scrim-mage players. 
  Fowler, Bullard and Easley are all likely 
to become elite pass rushers. But not one of them plays tackle or weighs more than 280 pounds. Although they’re great defensive linemen, they simply aren’t anchor players.
  The other options are 305-pound sopho-
more Leon Orr, who is known more for a marijuana-related arrest than anything he’s done on the ﬁ  eld, and 284-pound junior Damien Jacobs. Even if they pan out, they ob-viously can’t play every snap. 
  In the secondary, depth and positional 
versatility aren’t issues. The Gators have a wealth of talent on the back end. Cody Riggs and Jaylen Watkins could both shift to safety. Marcus Roberson, Loucheiz Purifoy and incom-ing ﬁ  ve-star recruit Vernon Hargreaves III will form an elite cornerback trio re-gardless. 
Adam: Evans gave the Gators a physical safety that wasn’t afraid to get in the arena and play. Sure, Texas A&M running back Ben Malena ran over Evans in College Station, Texas. See YouTube if you need a refresher. Evans didn’t just add versatility, though. He also played more snaps than the defensive tackle. Hunter admitted earlier this season that he played much less in 2012 due to in-creased depth along the line. Florida didn’t have that luxury in the secondary. 
  Riggs missed the season with a fractured 
foot. Roberson and Watkins played corner-back, and the only true safety with any play-ing time coming back is De’Ante Saunders — oh, wait. Brian Poole and Jabari Gorman headline a group of young players expected to earn more playing time at safety. Who says Riggs and Watkins will have an easier time at safety than Fowler and Bullard play-ing inside? Florida can hide the absence of a 300-pound nose tackle with blitzes and stunts. Defensive coordinator Dan Quinn has that on lock. You can’t hide a hole at safety. Just look at the production Florida has coming back at the safety and nose tackle positions.  Greg: Sure, Hunter’s snaps were limited in 2012. And yes, depth was key to the Gators’ success. But those facts aren’t knocks against Hunter. 
  No 300-pound player can handle the 
pounding of a double team for more than 60 or 70 percent of his team’s defensive snaps. When Hunter was asked to do that in 2011, the rush defense noticeably suffered, rank-ing 40th nationally with 132.7 yards per game allowed. In 2012, Hunter had backup, and Florida’s rush defense improved by 38 yards per game and 36 spots in the rankings. Without a solid two deep in the middle, the Gators could backslide on rush defense in 2013. In a league where controlling the clock and running the ball are paramount, any weakness on the defensive line could be a critical fault. 
  And if the Gators can’t hold the point of 
attack, no safety play or elaborate defensive scheme will make a difference. 
  Adam: The SEC may be a line-of-scrimmage 
league, but the question here is what will the Gators miss more — a player at an invaluable position, that they have depth at, or a player in the secondary who they may not have a suitable replacement for? I loved covering Hunter and if I ever did have a kid (I hope not soon), he would probably be the one player I’d let babysit. Greg, let’s just agree to disagree. Props on the Hunter “Dinosaurs” comparison, I must add. Here’s a better one for you, though. Have you ever seen Frankie Muniz in “Malcolm in the Middle?”
