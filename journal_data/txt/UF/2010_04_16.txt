Georges said. "I had a great
time."

Gainesville is expecting guests this weekend,
whether they are welcome or not.
About 10 members of the Westboro Baptist
Church will visit four Gainesville locations start-
ing at noon Sunday: Trinity United Methodist
Church, the UF Hillel, the Queen of Peace Cath-
olic Church and the Saint Augustine Catholic

round protesting Jews, homosexuals, Catholics,
Muslims, African Americans and parents of
American soldiers.
Student Government Student Alliance party
Sen. Alan Yanuck, who passed a resolution April
7 condemning the church's views, said studentswho oppose the group should just ignore them.
"[Church members] go from place to place try-
ing to get people to protest them, and that's ex-
actly what they want," Yanuck said.
UF Associate Dean of Students Paige Cran-
-,Wdall said students will gather
Sunday for a counter-rally,
"Love Conquers Hate: A Rally
for Human Rights." The event
will include speakers, tables for
protesters to hand out fliers and
music. It will be held from 1:30
Ip.m. to 3:30 p.m. at Bo Diddley
Crandall Community Plaza.
"It's going to be a way for
people to gather and show that we definitely do
not support what the Westboro Baptist Church is
saying," Crandall said.

man Bryson Smith
is one of six Gators
players who have

'Savage Love' writer gives sex, relationship advice
By ANDREW WYZAN
Alligator Contributing Writer
Dan Savage did not come to Gainesville to
promote what he called his "big, sweaty, gay
agenda," as some conservatives have thought
he was guilty of in the past.
Savage shared advice on sex and relation-
ships to a crowd of about 400 people Thursday
night in the Reitz Union Grand Ballroom.
Savage is the internationally acclaimed
writer of "Savage Love," a relationship and
sex advice column that is syndicated in more
than 70 newspapers worldwide.It is his humorous, blunt and downright
dirty style of writing that has made his column
popular, and he answered numerous ques-
tions from the audience in a similar way.
"He preaches to be yourself," said Alyssa
Craig, a UF psychology senior and director of
speakers and performers for Pride Awareness
Month.
"You have to love yourself first and then
love will form around you," Craig said.
That theme factored heavily into the ques-
tions posed to Savage by the audience.
One of his most in-depth responses was
to a question asking how someone deals with
their conservative parents."Firmly," Savage said. "You have to be the
grown-up during this process because they
will be children. The only
leverage you have is your
presence in their lives."
Katie Schubert, a gradu-
ate student, teaches a hu-
man sexuality course at UF
and heard about the speech
from her students.
savage "I like how he says how
it is," she said. "And his ad-
vice is very practical."
Following the speech, Savage hung back to
take pictures and sign autographs.In the end, there were some questions even
Savage wouldn't answer. "Is polyamory a
good idea in college?" a student asked.
Savage chuckled. "Pass."
Savage's speech was one of the headlining
events of Pride Awareness Month, a series of
events celebrating the LGBTQ community that
runs from April 1 to April 21. Pride Aware-
ness Month is spearheaded by Pride Student
Union, and Savage's speech was co-sponsored
by Accent. Savage was paid $10,500, according
to Student Government finance records. The
theme for Pride Awareness Month is "Love
Lawlessly," which organizers felt fit with Sav-
age's themes and writings.

Twin alumnae open cupcakerv
By DANIELLE LOGAN
Alligator Contributing Writer
Frozen yogurt is so four days
ago.
Yum Cupcakery opened its
oven doors on Monday, creating
an infectious demand for a new
kind of treat: cupcakes.
The bakery, 3345 SW 34th St., is
owned by twin sisters, Stephanie
and Claire Browning.
While both are UF alumnae, nei-
ther have a degree in baking. After
graduating last May with degrees
in classical studies and anthropol-
ogy, the sisters decided it wasn't
the right time for graduate school.
"We've always loved to cook
and bake," Stephanie Brown-
ing said. "We've wanted to do
this since we were little girls. We
thought, let's just do this now."
The options for customers' taste
buds are endless. There are 103
toppings, 30 different frostings and
18 flavors of cake, including carrot,
red velvet and banana.
Yum Cupcakery also offers
light, vegan, gluten-free, raw and
10 regular gourmet flavors.
Raw cupcakes are nutritious,
egg-free and made with no animal
products or ingredients heated
above 115 degrees. Light cupcakes
are half the calories of regular cup-
cakes.
On opening day, the bakery
sold about 50 cupcakes, and the
second day it sold about 75, Steph-
anie said. Customized cupcakes
range from $2 to $3 and include the
cake, filling, frosting and topping,
Stephanie said.
"It's completely customizable
and cheaper," Claire Browning
said. "It's a better value for a more
enjoyable experience."
Claire said future plans include
offering tea sandwiches, a sweets
buffet and a custom soda bar with

Students have a lot on their plates with exams approach-
ing, but performers in the Spring 2010 Bachelor of Fine Arts

Performers will balance dinner plates, practice tae-
kwondo and play the piano at the showcase, which started
Thursday and ends Sunday at the Nadine McGuire Theatre
and Dance Pavilion.
The show is known as It's [Comp]4LiCATED to recog-
nize its organizers from the Composition 4 class for dance
majors.

ementary school students from Duval County will also
perform.
Tickets are available for $9 at the University Box Office,
with four programs running Friday at 7 p.m., Saturday at
4 p.m. and 7 p.m., and Sunday at 2 p.m. and
On 4 p.m.
Campus Each semester, the BFA showcase gives
students of all levels a chance to perform their
dances while also featuring the work of guest performers
and choreographers from across the state, according to a
news release.
Graduating seniors also get to perform their senior so-
los, which many of them have been working on for months,
the release stated.
"When [patrons] come, they'll be immersed from the
moment they walk in the door," said Professor Kristin
O'Neal, the director of the show.
Melaney Holtham, a junior dance major, said she can't
wait for people to see the results of their hard work.
"Just because it encompasses everything in art," she said.
"Visual art, dance, music .we're educated in a way that
we explore all kinds of art and apply them to our craft."
Josh Stansbury, a junior dance major, also encouraged
people to attend.
"Just come and try it on," Stansbury said. "Even if you
don't think modern dance is your thing, you can learn a lot
about yourself by communicating with art."

'Paradise' event to fight cancer
0 THE EVENT WILL AT 7 P.M. AT THE
O'CONNELL CENTER.
Dressed to impress in a tropical paradise, guests
will take strides in the fight against cancer Saturday
in a "Polynesian Paradise."
The event, hosted by Stop! Children's Cancer
Inc., will be at 7 p.m. at the O'Connell Center and
benefit pediatric cancer research at the UF College
of Medicine.
Although the event will be a night of fun, fund-
raising for research is the main purpose.
"Research done for pediatrics can move up
to adults, but most adult research does not move
down to children," said Rebecca Burns, associate
executive director of the organization.
Unlike last year's live auction, this year's event
will have a silent auction with donated items rang-ing from $40 to $1,500, Burns said. There also will
be a feature auction for donated items more than
$1,500. Some of those items include a UF football
signed by UF's Heisman Trophy winners Steve
Spurnier, Danny Wuerffel and Tim Tebow; a vaca-
tion to the Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas; and guitars
signed by Tom Petty and Brad Paisley.
Burns estimates between 1,200 to 1,500 people
will attend the event, which will have
Lifent music, Polynesian cuisine and casino
e games.
Last year's event raised almost
$250,000, Burns said.
Tickets for the event are $150 and can be pur-
chased at the Stop! office, located at 2622 NW 43rd
St., online at stopchildrenscancer.org or at the front
door the night of the event. Corporate tables, which
seat 10, are $1,500.

Federal grant offers
appliance rebates
By ASHLEY MOSES
Alligator Contributing Writer
Local appliance stores are preparing to be bombarded by
customers today during the Florida Energy Star Appliance Re-
bate Program.
The program, made possible by a federal grant and leg-
islation signed by Gov. Charlie Crist in 2009, will provide 20
percent rebates for about 68,000 new Energy Star appliances
purchased from Florida retailers.
Stores will have additional inventory, extended hours and
extra staff to assist customers applying for rebates.
Crist said appliances purchased between today and April
25 will qualify for rebates, according to a press release. Pur-
chasers can reserve rebates by applying for a priority number
starting at 11 a.m. today.
Energy Star refrigerators, freezers, washers, dishwashers,
gas tankless water heaters and room air conditioners are eli-
gible for rebates.
Robert Jammer, appliance professional at Martin Appliance
Family on Northwest Fourth Boulevard, said employees have
been working day and night to accommodate the high number
of costumers they expect. The store has also been assisting cus-
tomers by offering layaway sales that will end Friday.
The store will be extending its hours over the weekend,
staying open from 6 a.m. until at least 2 a.m.
"This is the biggest appliance day in the last 20 years," he
said.

ting with the program and allowing graduate students Jon
Bougher and Roman Safiullin to use the footage captured in
the aftermath of the Haiti earthquake in their thesis.
We're going to throw a we're-not-really-sure-why-you-
wouldn't-allow-it-in-the-first-place-but-thanks-for-eventu-
ally-doing-the-right-thing LAUREL to the UF administra-
tion.
This next person, we're not too happy with. And he comes
in the form of the resident Mad Hatter of the Gainesville
Tea Party.
That's right, Don Marsh, we're talking to you.
For those of you who have no idea what's going on out-
side our vine-clad halls, there was a runoff city election
Tuesday between Marsh and City Commissioner Craig
Lowe (We can't hold it against you, though. A certain un-
named Alligator assistant sports editor didn't know about
it, either).
Well, the day before the election, one of our cute, little
freelance writers tried contacting Marsh for an article, so,
you know, it would be fair and unbiased.
However, old Donny boy didn't want any part of that.
He yelled at her, hung up on her and then proceeded to
Tweet about it.
So that's why we're going to throw a you-should-have-
left-your-phone-at-home-because-it-was-a-disaster DART
to Mr. Gaga himself. Maybe if you didn't leave your head
and your heart on that Tea Party dance floor you could have
won the election.
And while we're on the subject of dancing, we'd like
to congratulate everyone involved in Dance Marathon for
raising a ton of money for a good cause.
So we're going to print a bunch of LAURELs on T-shirts
and stand -er, dance -around for 26.2 hours so the Dance
Marathon organizers and participants can get a good look
at them.
And speaking of dancing, Gov. Charlie Crist busted a
smart political move today when he announced that he
would veto the controversial Senate Bill 6, which has had
Florida teachers' panties in quite a twist. The bill, which
would institute a system of merit pay for Florida teachers
based on improvements in their students' learning, has
earned the governor's office more than 120,000 angry mes-
sages demanding the eradication of the bill.
Overwhelming public opposition -and we suspect a
few lit bags of crap on his front porch -inspired Crist to
give the bill the boot. For that, we're drop-kicking a LAU-
REL all the way up to the Florida Capitol and dropping it
on Charlie Crist's head.
We much prefer to see our teachers dancing for joy in-
stead of sending us requests to join Facebook groups against
the bill.
Well, we'll see you next week. Unless we're all dead,
dead, dead from the pressure of exam week.

US should stay vigilant, fight Marxists
uess what, folks? The scientists are at it again. No,they're not doing sciencey things. They're busy pro-
moting Al Gore's global warming Ponzi scheme.
We told you to ignore them. We told you that because it
was cold one day when it should have been warm, Gore's
global warming was just a lukewarm scam to get you to -
gasp -recycle and be efficient.
Don't fall for it. Be a responsible, informed citizen and
ask questions. Get a chalkboard if you can. It helps when
you tell others about your thoughts. Make sure you have
tissues around, though, because some of your words will
be smeared by your tears.
Now, remember when those scientists were found out
to be the lying perpetrators of Al Gore's global warming
scam in that whole stolen e-mail scandal?
The cover-up continues, my friends.
An independent panel has ruled that the scientists "act-
ed with integrity and made no attempt to manipulate their
research on global temperatures." Oh, really? You call be-
ing scientifically objective and trying to consider both sides
of the issue on Al Gore's global warming an act of integ-
rity?
I beg to differ. There is only one side of Al Gore's global
warming debate, and it is this: Liberals, progressives, com-
munists, fascists and especially Marxists are lying to you.
And they're doing it because they don't care about you.
You know who cares about you? We do. I and others like
me care about you and want you to feel safe when you
go outside. We don't want you to be afraid of big, bad Al
Gore's global warming because there is nothing to worry
about. And we're definitely not just in it for the money, I
promise.
My heroes Glenn Beck, Hannity the Manatee and Rush
Limbaugh have been telling you for years that Gore's glob-
al warming was a myth perpetrated by the aforementioned
groups. If only we had listened. We could have stopped
that pesky recycling process and allowed a comfortablePaul Murty
letters@ali gator orglayer of smog to cover our dear city.
It would intimidate our opponents
in all sports if they saw our city
shrouded in an ominous layer of
healthy pollution.
And it's not just Al Gore's global
warming that these "scientists" want
to lie to you about for their own
profit. They want to stop the wheels
of capitalism and the free market.
This became even more apparent when in Scotland and
northern England, flights were canceled Thursday due to a
cloud of volcanic ash from an eruption in Iceland.
Can you say overreaction? They just want to stop the
passengers from shopping at the duty-free shops because
they can't get any of their precious taxes from the stores.
Everyone knows that the goal of Obama's left-wing radical-
ism is to increase taxes on everyone in every country, and
that includes the ultimate goal of eliminating the duty-free
stores. How better to do that than to create some scientific
problem with volcanic ash? Why would the ash even visit
Britain right now? If I were the ash, I would float down
to the Caribbean. But the Marxists knew that wouldn't
make much of an impact, so they decided to have the ash
head to Britain, somewhere we all know well because of
its terrifying health care system. They're so Marxist they
had Obamacare before Obama was even born. Except their
Obamacare doesn't provide the opportunity for increased
competition like ours does. But don't pay attention to that.
All I'm saying is that we need to stay vigilant against
the Commie-Marxists. Don't get angry at them, they can't
help it.
Remember, Barack Obama's mother and father both left
him for Marxism. He didn't stand a chance.
At least that's what Glenn Beck told me.

Reader presents Darts & Lauels
I'd like to present a way-to-step-up-
to-the-plate LAUREL to the organiz-
ers and participants of last weekend's
Dance Marathon. More than half a
million dollars is a lot and shows what
happens when people use money
for what actually matters. Good job!
Conversely, I'd like to throw a we-can-
do-much-better-than-this DART at the
UF community (myself included) for
only reaching 70 percent of the $50,000
fundraising goal set by Gators United
for Haiti.
It vexed me that $517,260 was
raised over the weekend but only
$35,500 was raised all semester to
send relief to a nation where 200,000
people died and one million became
homeless. The University Alumni As-
sociation will match our donations up
to $50,000 by the end of the semester.
I beg us to examine our erroneous ex-
penditures and skip that $10 meal at
our favorite restaurant for a last-ditch
donation to Gators United for Haiti.
We've got two weeks. Let's do this.

Enough Tiger coverage
I am tired of hearing about Ti-
ger Woods in the media. Last week's
coverage of The Masters talked more
about Woods than every other golfer
combined.
I realize that Woods is one of the
most famous golfers in the world, and
a lot of people watched The Masters
because of him, but why do the media
mostly cover him, when other golfers
perform better?
The Masters was Woods' first com-
petition since his leave of absence.
More people tuned into The Mastersthis year, and ratings for The Masters
were 36 percent higher than last year.
I understand that people were curious
to know how Woods would play after
a long break, but it should not domi-
nate news coverage.
No matter which station I turned
on, the story was always about Woods.
After all, Tiger finished fourth, and
no other athlete got close to the same
amount of attention.

Evaluations help professors im-
prove skills
Contrary to the beliefs many stu-
dents at UF and the Alligator Editorial
Board have, I believe that professors
and teaching assistants do care about
our feedback.
This may not hold true for every
single course here at UF, but certainly
for the majority of them. Our feedback
not only lets instructors know how
students feel about the class, it gives
them feedback on how to improve
their techniques and materials for
their courses and helps them recog-
nize flaws in their teaching methods.
This helps professors and teachers im-
prove their skills. Instructors will not
stop teaching because of evaluations.
Give the professors a chance. They are
only human, you know.

Senior's reflection on college dat-
ing
This letter is in response to the ar-
ticle "Grads look back on sex, relation-
ships and dating scene."I too have been reminiscent re-
cently of my last four years as an un-
dergrad. My collegiate career is quite
different from most students. I trans-
ferred from a community college (not
Santa Fe), and I had two years, instead
of four, to make friends at UF.
I have to say that the road has been
very difficult. I came to UF already
knowing some students and in a rela-
tionship with a former male friend -
my second boyfriend. This male friend
asked me out on Facebook. When he
did that, something inside me wanted
to ask my mother if he really liked me
or was just so desperate to have a girl-
friend right away that he couldn't pick
up a phone. I was infatuated with the
idea and accepted his offer.
I should have gotten to know him
as a friend before accepting. I came to
find out that he had two completely
different lives -hanging out with
friends who were doing possibly ille-
gal activity and being in church lead-
ership group here in Gainesville. We
eventually broke up. While all of this
was going on, I tried to find an organi-
zation on campus where I could meet
people and learn more about God.
Senior year I finally woke up and
realized who I am and what I like and
dislike. I had to stop talking to some
people because they did not appreci-
ate the person I became. My points
are: If a man was really interested in
a woman, he would call her or talk to
her in person; it is good if a woman is
the guy's friend first before becoming
romantically involved.
If a person goes too fast to soon it
may end up being a waste. And don't
waste your time with people who
don't appreciate you for who you are.

Guest column
Church opposes
Wesboro visit
his weekend Gainesville will be visited
by protesters from the Westboro Bap-
tist Church of Topeka, Kan. This group is
known for their protests of military funerals, con-
tempt for homosexuals and other groups.
As a Southern Baptist church serving this
community for over 50 years, Westside Baptist
Church of Gainesville wishes to officially dis-
tance itself from this group and their message.
Westside holds to the value of love as de-
fined by the Bible -our authority for truth and
practice. It is this love that causes us to embrace
the life of Christ and encourage others to do the
same.
No person coming into contact with Westside
Asa Walker is subjected to a message of
hate. Rather, our mission
Speaking Out is to share the good news
of love and redemption
found in the gospel of Jesus Christ. This remains
our mission regardless of a person's race, occu-
pation, gender, faith, national origin, sexual ori-
entation or any other discriminating factor.
As the events of this weekend unfold, the
Gainesville community should know that West-
side has no part in and is strictly opposed to
this group's actions and message. While they
hide behind their "Baptist" label, this group in
no way represents our church or the Baptist de-
nomination at large.
Asa Walker is a member of Westside Baptist
Church.

He called the president a liberal, socialist,
communist, Marxist and fascist, and he rallied
against high taxes. When asked, he couldn't
name any new taxes created by the Obama
administration, other than health care taxes
on the upper class and some businesses.
The speakers also discussed local issues.
Mayoral candidate Don Marsh stopped by on
his way to the Supervisor of Elections Office
to thank the Tea Partiers for supporting him
in the city election.
Michael Katz, a Marsh supporter who
owns a body shop, spoke against Gainesville
Regional Utilities' high rates, which he said
help the city pay for services other than en-
ergy.
Katz works with Gainesville's Elder Care
Board and told a story about an elderly sick
woman who couldn't afford to pay her heat-
ing bill without help from a charity.
And while the Tea Partiers promoted the
importance of the Constitution and the First
Amendment, not everyone's views were wel-

Two activists were booed for holding
"9/11 truth" signs. As they walked around
the plaza with their signs, Tea Partiers circled
them with American flags and told them to
leave.
Gainesville police intervened to make sure
an argument between the protesters didn't
turn into anything physical or violent.

Red Bull chariot race
to make stop at UF
By VINCENT ALVARADO
Alligator Contributing Writer
Red Bull claims to give you wings,
but this Saturday, it's giving teams
the chance to honor Olympic gods in
Gainesville's first chariot race.
UF is Red Bull's eighth stop in its
12-university tour. The race will take
place from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. at the Vault
Night Club parking lot.
Kevin Kelly, the Red Bull emcee for
the race, said each team's chariot must
have two wheels and a strut, which is
used to help pull the cart. Two team
members must pull the cart while the
other drives.
"You're going to have to expect the
unexpected," Kelly said. "It's like a sci-
ence fair meets a rodeo."
Each team is limited to three partici-
pants and will race its custom-built cart
down a course on the venue's parking
lot. Teams will represent an organiza-
tion and will race head-to-head until the
top two teams advance to the finals.
Kelly said the entered carts must not
be pre-made and cannot contain exter-
nal energy sources or sharp edges.
The fastest team will win the Hermes
Prize and will be given a secret Red
Bull experience. Other awards includethe Archimedes Award, given to the
most creative team and the Greek Spirit
Award, given to the fan favorite.
"We're going to try to put some
spare wood and bike parts together to
see what happens," said Jacob Lepera,
member of team "Broseidon," which
represents Gator Skim club. "We're go-
ing to wear togas and be spontaneous."
Lepera said his team plans on build-
ing its chariot the day before the race
and hopes its cart holds together.
"It's like a science fair meets a
rodeo."
Kevin Kelly
Red Bull emcee for the race
"Red Bull does nothing normal,"
Kelly said. "Every race features a cast of
characters that will help you remember
a good time."
According to Kelly, the original race,
which was held last year in Athens, Ga.
This year, the race has expanded into
a national tour to help people promote
and brand Red Bull.
The event is free and open to the
public.

Florida keeps winning despite injuries to key players
UF third baseman Bryson Smith has not played since March 20, when he dislocated his left
index finger against Mississippi State.0 UF STARTS A THREE-GAME SE-
RIES AGAINST KENTUCKY TODAY.
By TYLER JETT
Alligator Writer
tjett@alligator org
The Gators won twice as many games
as they lost in the last month, but it has
been painful.
Two starting pitchers were injured
on the mound. A pair of relievers suf-
fered tendinitis. The third baseman
couldn't even hold a bat.
And then there was right fielder
Kamm Washington, who suffered a sea-
son-ending hamstring tear in his right
leg after diving into a fence on Satur-
day. The team trainer described the col-
lision as "the closest thing to a car ac-
cident that we can simulate."
Time will heal those wounds, but No.
7 Florida (23-9, 8-4 Southeastern Con-
ference) is impatient. The Gators want
a regular-season SEC championship,
meaning a thin UF team hopes to not
waver tonight on the road at 7 against
Kentucky (21-12, 4-8 SEC).
"No one's going to feel sorry for
us," UF coach Kevin O'Sullivan said.
"We've got to figure it out, and we've
got to play our best baseball in the next
couple weeks. It is what it is, and we've
got to battle through it."
UF received some good news this
week with the return of third baseman
Bryson Smith, who has not played since
dislocating his left index finger while
diving into first base against Missis-
sippi State on March 20.
Smith's finger snapped backwards to
form a 90-degree angle and looked like
a reverse L. Florida trainer John Barrett
said only rest could heal the injury.
While waiting to recover, Smith said
he hit off a tee and unsuccessfully tried
catching fly balls with a left-handed
glove."It's been a struggle," Smith said.
"I've never sat out this long for an in-
jury during a season.
Smith's finger healed enough for
him to field ground balls on Monday,
and he started hitting against a pitching
machine Tuesday. Smith said he was
relieved to be back on the field, but his
footwork was awkward and his defense
was porous this week.
"You can't really take off three weeks
in baseball and expect to be right back
out in perfect shape," he said.
But just getting Smith on the field is
a relief for Barrett. The trainer said most
of UF's injured players will be healthy
again soon, but this has been his busiest
season.
"Maybe we were just lucky in the
past," Barrett said. "The baseball gods
were good to us, but we've got some
challenges now."
With injuries to starting pitchers
Tommy Toledo (facial
fractures) and Brian
Johnson (strained back
muscle), UF does not
Baseball have a Sunday starter
this week. O'Sullivan
said he will pick a pitch-
er after Saturday's game, when he can
look at his roster and see who is still
fresh.
But the most important member of
the team right now is Barrett, who said
he is rehabbing more players than any
trainer in the SEC.
"I've got the most chips in this poker
game," he said.
The majority of UF's injuries are not
serious, Barrett said, so O'Sullivan is
optimistic that his team can be back to
full strength in about a month, when
the stakes rise.
"If we can weather the storm,"
O'Sullivan said, "I think we can be a
team that hopefully nobody wants to
play against come regional time."

No. 8 Commodores pose tough task for Gators
UF midfielder Caroline Chesterman and the Gators hope their home-field advantage
will help them upset No. 8 Vanderbilt on Saturday.4By TONI-ANN MILLER
Alligator Writer
Florida beat its first conference opponent
-then-No. 14 Penn State -at home two
weeks ago, but when No. 8 Vanderbilt comes
to Gainesville this weekend, UF will need its
home-field advantage once again if it is to get
another American Lacrosse Conference win.
UF (9-5,1-2 ALC) took down Penn State, 13-
11, in a clean and competitive match on April
3. The Gators, 7-1 at home, charged ahead in
the second half after being tied at the break to
grab the victory.
However, against Vanderbilt (10-3, 3-0
ALC), UF will need to play a nearly flawless
game.
The Commodores will be ready to add the
Gators as another notch in their current nine-
game winning streak. They lost their first two
games of the season, but have won 10 of the
last 11.
"They are a fantastic team," UF coach
Amanda O'Leary said. "They have a lot of
upperclassmen. I don't think they start any
freshmen. They are a talented team, they are
an experienced team, and they have great stick
skills, so we're trying to find the Achilles' heel
of Vanderbilt."
The Commodores don't have a fatal flaw
for opponents to capitalize on as they average
about 15 goals per game, allow opponents to
score just fewer than 11 goals and hold teams
Florida also interested in two 6-foot-7 forward recruits for 2010 class
HOOPS, from page 18
Young has skyrocketed up re-
cruiting boards recently, going from
an unheralded prospect to one of
the more intriguing unsigned point
guards remaining.
Another guard option looking to
get out of his current commitment
is Jalen Steele, a 6-foot-2 guard who
was released from his letter-of-intent
with Auburn last week.
Steele signed with Auburn in
November, but he has received a lotof attention from other Southeastern
Conference schools, particularly Ole
Miss and Mississippi State.
Meyer said Steele is another
fringe, mid-major to high-major re-
cruit, but given UF's inability to land
top-tier guards like Knight and Mc-
Callum, that's the most the Gators
can hope for in the late signing pe-
riod, which ends May 19.
"That's the big question with
all these guys that Florida is left to
recruit now. Not that they're bad
players. Just that they're not defi-nite high-major prospects," Meyer
said. "They have definite flaws as
prospects. Sometimes those flaws
can be overcome
and these guys
are great, and
then there's other
Men's times they don't,
Basketball so it's a very dif-
ficult call."
UF is also in-
terested in two 6-foot-7 forwards,
Will Yeguete and Marcus Thornton.
Meyer said Thornton, a three-starforward from Atlanta, will prob-
ably stay close to home and sign
with Georgia or Georgia Tech, or be
reeled in by Kentucky coach John
Calipari. Yeguete, a forward from
Melbourne Florida Air Academy, is
the more likely option for UF, Meyer
said.
Regardless, the top priority for
the Gators remains bringing in an-
other guard to relieve Erving Walker
and Kenny Boynton, especially after
Ray Shipman's decision to transfer.
If this offseason is a repeat oflast year, when UF missed on John
Wall, Eric Bledsoe and several other
guards before signing Rod Tishman,
Donovan will again find himself
with depth issues in the backcourt.
"They can function -Walker
and Boynton will be better as play-
makers than they were last year,"
Meyer said. "But I think it's safe to
say it would be a disappointment.
Florida really wanted to get a qual-
ity point guard, and it's looking
questionable if that's going to hap-
pen now.

The challenge for Florida will be to con-
tain Vandy's multiple threats and prevent the
Commodores' offense from being the decid-
ing factor in the game. They have four players
who have scored 30 or more goals already this
season and another four players with double-
digit goals.
"They have great stick skills, so
we're trying to find the Achilles'
heel of Vanderbilt."
Amanda O'Leary
UF lacrosse coach
O'Leary said the Commodores have qual-
ity players but are also beatable.
However, UF must focus on its play rather
than its opponent's game, and it must also fin-
ish its shots and take advantage of opportuni-
ties.
Freshman Caroline Chesterman said the
Gators will take advantage of the game's loca-
tion on Sunday as it battles for a second ALC
win.
"We've only lost one game at home so
far, against Georgetown, and even then, we
played really well," Chesterman said. "There's
something about playing here in front of our
friends and family that we usually come out
really hyped and ready to go, so hopefully we
do the same thing against Vandy."

0 THE GATORS HOST THE
THIRD-ANNUAL TOM JONES
MEMORIAL INVITE.
By RYAN BUTLER
Alligator Writer
Former UF track and field
coach Percy Beard helped create
and build one of the best men's
teams in the country. This Sat-
urday's meet on Percy Beard
Track will commemorate one
of the most important figures in
the women's team's history.
The third-annual Tom Jones
Memorial Invite will give the
men's and women's track teams
another home meet to prepare
for the Southeastern Conference
and NCAA Championships in
May and June, respectively. It
will also honor an icon of UF
track and field.
Jones died on Mar. 21, 2007
at age 62 after battling cancer.
He coached the women's cross
country and track teams from
the fall of 1992 until the spring
of 2007 and led them to six SEC
championships.
"He had a huge impact on
UF, and it's really important to
him that we perform well in the
meet to remember him," mid-
dle-distance runner Charlotte
Browning said.
The meet features teams
from UCF, USF, Florida Atlan-
tic, Kentucky, Brown, Princeton
and UCLA. It begins at 1 p.m.
on Saturday on the track at
James G. Pressly Stadium.
"When we have a home com-
petition, we want to show our
best to the people who watch usfrom Gainesville," shot putter
Kemal Mesic said.
After a highly successful
Florida Relays two weekends
ago that saw the Gators set
two school records and win 10
events against some of the best
competition in the country, the
Tom Jones Memorial will give
UF a more low-key meet to pre-
pare for the championship com-
petitions later in the season.
Browning said this is the
most important time of the year
for the team because the ath-
letes can put in some of their
hardest training without taper-
ing their workouts to compete
in regular-season meets.
This will be the first meet
for Steve Lemke
as associate head
coach. Lemke has
served as throwsTrack coach for the past
four seasons at UF
and has coached 12 Olympic
qualifiers during his 25 years of
collegiate experience.
"He's one of the best coach-
es in the world for throwing
events," Mesic said. "He's a
hard worker, and he makes
us work hard to achieve our
goals."
Lemke has assembled one
of the most talented throwing
units in the world and features
athletes from the Netherlands,
Brazil, Georgia, Australia and
Bosnia.
The group is led by Mariam
Kevkhishvili, who is a four-
time NCAA Champion in the
shot put, including winning the
event in the indoor this year.

No easy outs in
UF's batting order
0 FLORIDA FACES KEN-
TUCKY IN LEXINGTON THIS
WEEKEND.
By GREG LUCA
Alligator Writer
Against a lineup like Florida's,
opposing pitchers never get so
much as a second to breathe.
Normally, pitchers have the
luxury of working around the
stronger hitters and attacking the
weaker ones, but for the Gators,
each batter is as dangerous as the
next.
And it only gets worse each
time through the order.
Over the course of Southeastern
Conference play, the Gators have
proven that every bat in the lineup
is capable of doing damage, and
that they only get stronger as the
game wears on.
This is a trend No. 3 Florida (32-
4, 12-2 SEC) will look to continue
when Kentucky (26-16, 10-9 SEC)
comes to Gainesville for a weekend
series starting Saturday at 1 p.m.
The Gators are tops in the SEC
and third in the nation with 7.38
runs per game, a figure that has
been critical to the success of a
team that is 50th nationally with a
2.22 team ERA.
"That's the name of the game,
UF coach Tim Walton said. "We've
been doing a good job of finding a
way to score runs and gets wins."
The strength of the team's line-up has come from its ability to get
both hits and home runs from a
number of different players.
UF is the only team in the SEC
that has seven starters hitting bet-
ter than .300. Tennessee, Georgia
and Ole Miss are all tied for second
with five. The Gators are also the
only squad to have a trio of players
with 10 or more home runs, with
only Georgia and Arkansas having
as many as two.
"We've got a lot of options and
a lot of good things going on,"
Walton said. "Everybody gets hits,
and I'm very happy with that."
Earlier in the season, it was
easy to point to Francesca Enea as
the reason for the Gators' offensive
success.
The senior, who was recently
named a finalist for the 2010 USA
Softball Collegiate Player of the
Year award, leads the SEC with an
.892 slugging percentage, 15 home
runs and 50 RBIs.
But Enea is only eighth on the
team with a .243 average in SEC
play, although Florida has still
managed to go 12-2 in conference.
Over that span, the Gators have
relied on their ability to make qual-
ity in-game adjustments to keep
their run production high.
In conference games, UF hitters
are only batting .206 the first time
through the order.
But that average shoots up to
.296 the second time through, then
increases to .426 during the third
trip around.
