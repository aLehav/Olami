visit www.alligator.orgEUGENE, Ore. (AP) — An Oregon man has 
had an Awesome name change.
Douglas Allen Smith Jr. says he changed his 
name to Captain Awesome last month because 
he was inspired by the nickname of a character on the NBC television show “Chuck” — Dr. De-von “Captain Awesome” Woodcomb.
The unemployed Eugene cabinet installer 
says he found it funny Woodcomb’s father gave him that nickname because a “poor nickname builds good character.”The former Mr. Smith says he faced a Lane 
County judge who questioned his seriousness. The judge that granted the request made him swear he wasn’t changing his name for fraudu-lent reasons.
Awesome says that judge also allowed him 
to sign his name as a right arrow, a smiley face and a left arrow.
He says his bank, however, has refused to 
accept the signature because it could be forged too easily.What’s in a name? Man goes from Smith to Awesome

 ONE STUDENT SPOKE.

The UF Police Department’s 
national accreditation is being 
re-evaluated, and students, fac-
ulty and citizens had the chance to put in their two cents Mon-day afternoon.
A public forum was held at 
the UPD administration build-ing on Museum Road to al-low the community the chance to praise, criticize or suggest 
changes to the department. Out 
of 13 speakers, only one was a student.
The department is re-evalu-
ated every three years.
Speakers from the Counsel-
ing and Wellness Center, the University Athletic Association and the Department of Parking and Transportation talked about UPD’s professionalism, willing-
ness to cooperate with groups 
across campus and commitment to protecting the Student Body.
David Schneider, a third-year 
political science and history ma-jor, and Dianne Tornay, a resi-dent of the city , were the only 
participants to advise against 
the re-accreditation. They cited a lack of trust between students and police following the near-fa-tal shooting of graduate student Kofi Adu-Brempong last March and suggested a citizen-run re-view board to help redesign critical response procedures.
Capt. Fred 
Miller, of the Prince William County Police De-
partment in Virginia, heading the process, said the re-evalua-tion will last until at least March. Until then, students, faculty or citizens may send letters to be added to the report.
Interested parties should 
write to the Commission Ac-creditation for Law Enforcement Agencies at 13575 Heathcote Blvd., Suite 320, Gainesville, Va., 20155.Public speaks 
out about UPDBy JILLIAN KREMER

It’s 4 p.m. on a Monday when Bret Denney gets a call 
from his boss. One of the pigs is in serious trouble. 
A veterinary student accidentally castrated a pig with 
a hernia earlier in the day, and now its intestines are fall-
ing out. This happens sometimes when a pig has a weak abdominal wall. 
The pig has no name. In agriculture, they never do. It 
would be too hard to keep track of all the animals. Den-ney knows the pig as No. 176 by the notches on the ear. 
Denney has little time to do something he has never 
done before. He stuffs the red, mushy intestines in as best 
he can back up through the tiny laceration and stitches 
it up. It takes almost 20 minutes because the hole is so small.
Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays this semester al-
ways start the same. At 7 a.m., Denney leaves the two-
room swine-unit apartment he shares with his good friend 
Parker Capparelli, also from Dade City. They’re like any other college kids living independently, except they’re in charge of caring for about 450 animals. 
The unit is a collection of wooden buildings about sev-
en minutes away from UF’s main campus. Hundreds of 
pigs, 50 sows, 30 chickens, four boars and three students 
call it home. 
Denney puts on one of the pairs of rubber boots that 
are always outside the front door. He can smell the pigs. 
He can hear the boars. It’s feeding time. 
He checks out the mothers and litters to make sure 
everyone wakes up. If a baby doesn’t wake up when the 
food is there, it’s usually a sign something is seriously wrong. Today, fortunately, the pigs are fine. 
The boars, since there are so few of them, have names. 
Denney says, “Hi,” to Goliath and Daddy. There’s also Will, a 600-pound, Oreo-colored pig who is the only Hampshire in the unit. The rest are Yorkshires, the typical 
pale, pink pigs. 
Denney is partially responsible for feeding the pigs 
three to four tons a week. The entire process takes about 30 minutes each morning and afternoon, as long as there’s nothing else to do.
Almost every Monday the veterinary students come to 
UF’s Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences swine-
teaching unit to work with the pigs. Some of them look nervous, as if they’re the first live animals they have han-
dled. 
Denney envies them. The pigs do not intimidate him 
because he has enough experience. He has always wanted 
to be a vet. Always. But he’s worried that just wanting it 
won’t be enough. 
Denney was 4 years old when he showed his first ani-
mal for the 4-H Club at the Pasco County Fair in his home-
town in Dade City — the type of town where everybody knows everybody. Gossip travels fast, but once people 
know you, they trust you. Denney is trusted there.
Kids start out showing chicken and bunnies just for 
fun. At age 8 he started with pigs, buying them young, 
raising them for six months or so and showing them com-
petitively. Steers and heifers came a few years later. Den-
ney eventually saved enough money selling animals at the Student balances school with animal care

Mich. woman can sue over 
toilet paper dispenser
DETROIT (AP) — A Michi-
gan woman says she can’t 
work or crochet and her bowl-
ing game has suffered since her 
right hand was broken by a toi-let paper dispenser in a restau-rant bathroom.
The Michigan Supreme Court, 
in a 4-3 order, has refused to throw out Sheri Schooley’s law-suit against Texas Roadhouse in suburban Detroit. Liberal 
justices were in the majority in 
a decision that raises questions about what businesses need to do to protect themselves from 
liability in strange situations.
Schooley, 58, acknowledged 
it’s a “bizarre story.” 
She and her husband were 
out for dinner on New Year’s Eve 2007 when she visited the 
restroom.
“I reached and the cover of 
the toilet paper dispenser fell 
down on my hand,” the South 
Rockwood woman told The As-sociated Press on Monday. “It looked like the dispenser was up but it wasn’t latched. 
Three years later, “I still 
cannot use the hand. I have no grip,” said Schooley, who had to quit her job as an adminis-
trative assistant because she 
couldn’t type.
A Wayne County judge and 
the state appeals court have re-fused the restaurant’s request 
to dismiss the lawsuit.

followed the lower courts, most 
recently in an order released

UF ACADEMICS

 The idea that it’s “All in the Family” may 
seem like a notion abandoned in the golden 
age of the 1950s, but a UF professor is striving to teach Americans that the traditional fam-ily structure heralded as ideal doesn’t ensure  picture-perfect families.
  John Scanzoni, a UF sociology professor, 
said the topic of families in the United States is a live issue, despite it taking the backseat to economics in the political arena as of late. His book on the subject, “Healthy American Fami-lies: A Progressive Alternative to the Religious Right,” was published in April, and he has been studying the evolution of families throughout human history for 25 years. 
  The Tea Party, he believes, is becoming a 
more prominent power economically, and the recent debates between the religious right and everyone else has kept family as a formidable political force, he said. They have effectively created the idea that the nuclear family has an inherent sense of morality and that anything 
besides the husband-wife-and-children model 
is non-moral. 
   “People decided that one form wasn’t work-
ing, so they made another. Sometimes it’s hard for us to grasp that because we tend to think 
the family is a rock,” he said. “We don’t realize 
it’s an artifact that people make and do. People 
are active in re-inventing families.
  Scanzoni used the popular AMC TV show “Mad Men,” which takes place in the early 
1960s, to illustrate the point that although there is a facade of stability among couples from that 
era, there was just as much discontentment and 
sexual promiscuity beneath the surface as there 
is today.  
   “The fact that they didn’t get divorced 
meant nothing,” he said. “Divorce means to be 
honest and free; people are simply saying that 
they don’t want to live that way anymore.” 
  For Brittany Brave, a second-year public re-
lations major, the archetypal unit doesn’t nec-
essarily make for the healthi-
est family. 
  “I don’t think that a good 
family is deﬁ  ned by gender and sexuality and sexual preferences,” she said. “It’s 
deﬁ  ned by support, love, 
loyalty and compassion. You 
could have two gay dads, 
and, no, it’s not the standard image, but they 
could have a perfectly healthy family.”    
  Scanzoni said it’s the responsibility of the 
privileged to develop and institute laws to pro-
vide the less-advantaged with opportunities to learn about fashioning families that are beneﬁ  -cial to them. 
  “The important thing is to understand that 
unlike biological evolution, where we don’t have much control, humans can affect the course of family evolution,” he said. “If we re-alize we have a part to play, we’ll try to act in an intelligent fashion.” Prof debunks familial ideals

 In an effort to foster ties within 
The Gator Nation, the UF Alumni Association will soon have a new Gator Club in Gainesville.
A Gator Club is usually a 
group of at least 50 alumni in an area who have interest in starting a club.
  The club, which will most like-
ly be formed in the spring, has Titletown Gator Club as its pro-posed name.
    Katie Marquis, UFAA interim 
executive director, is excited for the proposed club.
  Marquis said there has been a 
lot of interest generated, and the UFAA supports the effort.
  In Gainesville, there are about 
30,000 alumni.
  “I think this club will be active 
in the community and assist with driving new UF initiatives for alumni and friends,” she said.  There are about 100 Gator 
Clubs internationally, according to UFAA’s website.
  One person who knows of 
the excitement of a Gator Club is Stephanie Bailes.
  Bailes is currently on the Board 
of Directors for the UFAA and has assisted with getting this group off the ground.
  “It’s just exciting to be part of 
something that has such potential 
to provide beneﬁ  t to The Gator Nation,” Bailes said.
  Some members of 
the Gainesville com-
munity have already heard about the new club and are excited.
  Tracy Wright, a local UF alum-
na, said a place to get together and a way to cater to families is a good thing.
  “I think there are a lot of peo-
ple in town who would like to have a more formalized network of activities,” she said.  Gainesville alumni

UF sophomore Jacob Sickerman, bottom left, paints the word “Jus-
tice” on the back of the menorah outside of Hillel on Monday night. 
RELIGION
By SAMANTHA LIEBHABER
Alligator Contributing Writer
In an effort to show unity and 
take a stand against hate, members 
of the UF Jewish community gath-
ered together to reassemble the 
large menorah in the Hillel garden Monday night. 
The menorah was uprooted 
from its foundation, moved about 
15 feet and disassembled.
According to the program di-
rectors, the vandalism is thought 
to have occurred early Saturday 
morning. 
The menorah was discovered 
Saturday evening when Hillel staff 
went outside to light the fourth candle for the fourth night of Ha-
nukkah. 
Jessica Davis, program director, said the menorah was left outside 
and untouched to show the com -
munity that this is not an issue Hil-lel is embarrassed about. 
“People do things like this to 
break you and loosen morale,” she said. “But it always does the op-posite, and this has strengthened us.” 
Hillel program directors chose 
to leave the menorah until the re-dedication ceremony.
About 100 people gathered in 
the Hillel garden to watch the cer -
emony and see the menorah be placed back in its proper position.
UF President Bernie Machen 
and Hillel Executive Director Keith Dvorchik helped hoist the menorah up and stake it back in the ground.
“I’m here to express my love and admiration of the Jewish peo-ple,” Machen said. “Tonight we are all Jewish. God bless the Jew-ish people.”
Joshua Kahn, the Israel pro-
gram director at Hillel, said he saw about 10 people run out of a house behind Hillel and through the backyard at about 11 p.m. Friday night screaming “F--k Jews” and “Happy Hanukkah.” 
Kahn said he saw them kick 
down a section of the fence sur -
rounding Hillel and then drive off in a car.
Kahn said he hopes the rededi-
cation ceremony will prove that the Jewish population is integral part of the Gainesville community.
“We won’t back down in the 
face of intolerance and hate,” he said.Giant menorah re-erected

n THE STUDENTS CREATED THE 
ROBOTS FOR CLASSES OVER THE COURSE OF THE SEMESTER.
By ALEXANDER KLAUSNER
Alligator Writer
They are still a long way from C-3PO, 
R2-D2 and WALL-E, but over the course 
of the fall semester, the UF mechanical and electrical engineering students took cracks at creating their own robots.
The Robot Media/Guest Demo Day 
took place in the Harris Corporation Ro-tunda in the New Engineering Building on Monday afternoon, attracting about 70 spectators as students showed off the ro-
botic creations they had been working on 
all semester.
The two classes’ professors, Eric 
Schwartz and Antonio Arroyo, put on the 
event. 
It showcased robots designed for a va-
riety of tasks, including putting out fires, 
identifying home intruders and aiding fu-ture Gators in their tailgating ventures.
One of the robots was designed by a 
student to help play fetch with his dog, a 2-year-old German shorthaired pointer named Gunner.
The fetching robot, which was about 
the size of a skateboard, used an Android cell phone as a camera to search for  the tennis balls.  
When it identified the ball, it would 
move toward it and scoop it up using a rotating brush, pushing it back through a pipe and shooting it out the other end for 
the dog to fetch.
At one point during the event, the spec-
tators were called outside to 
witness the demonstration of a flying robot, a helicopter 
with four propellers designed 
to demonstrate its ability to fly without 
controls using GPS systems.
Non-engineering students also contrib-
uted to this semester’s demonstration.
Chester Udell, a third-year music com-
position graduate student, demonstrated a robot he named “MIRAG.”
The robot automatically plucked guitar 
strings and played in scales based on what color shirt was  in front of its camera.
Some demonstrations were more suc-
cessful than others, though the successes were more abundant this semester than in others, Schwartz said. 
He added that the class helps to prepare 
students for the real world of engineering 
and building from scratch.
“When they start, they know nothing 
about it, and at the end, they know every-
thing about it,” Schwartz said. “So there’s 
no fear. UF is giving you the skills to take 
an idea to reality. You take some idea and you make something real out of it.” Engineering students show off flying, fetching robots
OnCampu sfair to start his own herd of about 30 cows. 
To be a good showman, you need lots of 
practice, he said. 
“You’re showing the judge your animal; 
you’re not showing yourself.” 
To practice showing, Denney would stand 
in his backyard with a pig or a cow and one 
of his parents would be a judge. It’s impor -
tant to always keep the animal in the judge’s 
eyesight, so he would pretend a riding lawn mower was the animal, always moving it to keep it in his dad’s sight. 
In high school, Denney started to work 
for Dr. Chet Taylor, a vet who cared for both large and small animals. Taylor had attended UF 30 years before and lived in the swine 
unit. 
For the next five years, Denney learned 
the ins and outs of veterinary medicine. The 
vet practice became a second home, and the staff became like family. In between assisting 
in surgery, taking blood and cleaning teeth, 
he became confident. 
Denney also realized that working with 
the animals was the easy part. Their owners 
were another story, especially if the animals 
were theirs.
“People are much more laid back when 
it comes to steer and pigs than to cats and dogs,” he said. “It’s a business. I like that.”
So when it came time to leave the practice 
or stay for another two years of community college, he knew he had to stay. He couldn’t pass up the experience. 
He’s got to work on his grades. The classes 
at Pasco-Hernando Community College were a joke compared to his first UF classes. This is his second crack at organic chemistry, and he is studying earlier and more often.“There are lots of kids with as much ex-
perience as me and probably better grades,” 
Denney said. 
His heart is not set on UF. He will go any-
where that takes him. 
One day he wants to move back to Dade 
City, take over Taylor’s practice and be the 
town vet. 
If he doesn’t get in, he can earn a master’s 
degree or Ph.D. But it’s not time to think about that now. 
He’s got to study.TUESDAY, DECEMBER 7, 2010 n ALLIGATOR, 5

Grooveshark.com, a music-
streaming website founded by two 
former UF students, is giving pro-
grammers an opportunity to learn about the technology that makes it work. 
Grooveshark University is a free, 
12-week-long lecture series that al-lows its participants to learn  and perfect skills relevant to web devel-opment. The first semester wrapped 
up Dec. 2. Fifteen students attended 
class at Santa Fe’s Center for Inno-vation and Economic Development every Thursday at 6:30 p.m. 
Students were continually en-
couraged to create their own proj-ects.
“We had a lot of cool prototypes 
by the end of the semester: a side-
scroller game, a web-based RPG, 
a ‘Halo Reach’ application for An-droid and a music mashup site,” said senior software engineer Paulo Da Silva.
Grooveshark University student 
Ty Kauffman applied techniques learned in the class to develop a 
multiplayer strategy game called 
“Reign.”
“I was able sit down with Paulo 
Da Silva, Jay Paroline and Sky-ler Slade one-on-one and discuss

“We had undergraduate and 
graduate students taking the course, as well as some people who

Today’s question: Do you think your fellow Gainesvillians are intelligent?Monday’s question: Are you stressed about finals?
62 TOTAL VOTES56% YES44% NO
2010 was a good year for Republicans
This was an excellent year to be a Republican and/
or a fan of sludge. 
President Barack Obama was largely invisible 
for most of the year, ceding the majority of his screen time to two inanimate objects incapable of human emo-tion — Nancy Pelosi’s heavily Botoxed face and the BP Spill Cam. 
With such a powerful vacuum created at the top of 
the political structure, we Americans are unbelievably lucky that what got sucked into it and deposited atop our structures of governance, which are sublimely slimy.
Like most of the other living creatures in the Gulf 
of Mexico region, by the end of 2010, Floridians found themselves facing many years of sifting through tons of grime, poison and greasy dealings.
Gov.-elect Rick Scott, who Florida residents bravely 
elected to the highest office in the state in spite of his 
questionable past (he paid the largest Medicare fraud 
fines in history and may in fact be He-Man’s archenemy Skeletor), has promised to fix what ails our state with an emphasis on accountability.
Holding people accountable for their actions is how 
one commonly defines accountability, but a more subtle reading of the word is necessary due to the confining nature of the implicit idea that accountability must deal in some manner with reality. 
Accountability in Florida for the foreseeable future 
must be strained through two layers of conservative cheesecloth, as the new Florida Legislature is so chock full of blindingly white Republican men, it makes the Jim Crow-era legislature look like a rap video.
Defining how accountability will be interpreted in 
Florida is easy.
All you have to do is break down the word “account-ability” to the two root words Rick Scott must think it comprises — “account ability.”
Most animals have meager bank 
accounts and almost no ability to access large sums of money.
The lack of opposable thumbs 
means animals would have neg-ligible check-writing skills and 
therefore are among the least likely to attend the fund-raisers and banquets that are the natural habitats Repub-
licans as a species find most hospitable to their unique 
set of needs (a minimum of nine hours a day under ar -
tificial lighting and a climate suitable for a fine Merino 
wool coat they shed in the summer).
Alongside the less enterprising animals in our state, 
another group set up for failure in Florida is public 
school students who are unable to pass standardized 
tests. 
The now-conventional wisdom concerning account-
ability in Florida is these students, who are dispropor -
tionately poor and overwhelmingly disadvantaged, is that they would not have been born poor and disadvan-taged if they had any foresight or real drive to succeed.
As money is diverted from schools that house tested 
failures, maybe Rick Scott and the Legislature can cre-ate a work program that employs poor kids who fail the FCAT in somehow rehabilitating the Gulf of Toxic Dis-persants.
I hope so, because we’re going to need all the help we 
can get now and far into the future cleaning up the slime that 2010 hath wrought.

We’re, like, the smart-
est city in Florida, 
y’all!
According to Portfolio.
com, which ranked its list-
ings according to Census education and income data, 
Gainesville is the 14th smart-
est city in the nation and smartest overall in Florida, putting it 20 spaces ahead of our state’s capital and home 
to Florida State University, 
Tallahassee. 
And as for our metropoli-
tan neighbor to the north? Ocala came in at 181. 
So, all of you judging those 
supposedly dumb jocks or oh-my-god-I-have-a-semifor -
mal-to-attend-here-hold-my-Ugg-boots Florida girls, think 
again. We’re apparently a lot 
smarter than you think. 
But then again, the data 
Portfolio.com used to create its listing came from Cen-
sus data, which continu-ally changes as students mi-
grate to and forth from their 
home away from home. So 
Gainesville either supports it-self on its own merits or con-sistently attracts the highest-quality students year after 
year.
We’d like to think it in-
volves a bit of both. 
While perhaps not sur -
prising to many as the home to the best public university 
in Florida, it might surprise many that only about 18 per -
cent of Gainesville’s estimat-ed population of 259,587 has 
a bachelor’s degree. 
Perhaps this statistic, 
coupled with a high school 
dropout rating of more than 11 percent in Gainesville, will 
help the UF students who in-
evitably propelled Gainesville to its star status on this list to realize Gainesville doesn’t simply end at the university’s 
boundaries.Festival 
of blights
Hillel vandalism shameful
When UF’s Hillel should be focusing on celebrating its 
winter Festival of Lights, the organization for Jewish college students is, instead, trying to persevere in the 
face of alleged anti-Semitism. 
During the weekend, the large menorah outside UF’s Hil-
lel was pulled from the ground and had its oil lamps damaged 
in the process. The vandalism,  according to Joshua Kahn, the 
Hillel’s Israel program director, follows an unfortunate event Friday evening when about 10 people were witnessed saying, 
“F--- the Jews.”
These two acts come on the heels of a report released Friday 
by Attorney General Bill McCollum that found Alachua County 
ranked second in the state in number of overall hate crimes in 2009. One of these such hate crimes involved a swastika being painted on a UF Jewish fraternity house. 
The Editorial Board strongly condemns such actions, and 
we’re disgusted with such hateful acts. 
It will never be possible to progress as an inclusive, progres-
sive community when such deplorable acts of blatant religious 
intolerance plague our city and our university. 
Furthermore, when UF boasts the largest Jewish population 
of any public institution, according to the national Hillel group, 
each and every one us should be mortified for our community 
as a result of the select few individuals who choose to mar the 
image of inclusiveness Gainesville is known to embody. 
The Alligator strongly hopes the Hillel and the rest of the 
Jewish community enjoy the remainder of its Hanukkah free of 
persecution.

Recent events both home and abroad 
present us with an opportunity to ana-lyze what the future holds for the U.S. 
What I find truly tragic is how poorly pre-pared the populace is to apply past lessons to 
current events.
Historically, the average democracy has 
lasted 200 years. Thankfully, the U.S. is not 
and never has been a democracy or we would long ago have faded into obscurity and cha-os.
Look at the left coast for a modern example 
of why democracy is a bad thing. California voters have continued to expand social pro-
grams and refuse to allow any tax increases to 
solve their $20 billion deficit.
U.S. voters are similarly wired, but be-
cause we are not a direct democracy, instead they will punish their elected representatives for making difficult decisions to cut programs by voting them out at the first opportunity.
We have a crisis of enormous repercus-
sions looming and our public education sys-
tem has largely failed to prepare us for the 
moment. Virtually every penny collected in taxes presently goes to pay for Social Security and entitlement programs. This means we have to borrow from other countries in order to fund Medicare, defense and the rest of the discretionary budget.
I am not against publically funded retire-
ment programs, but they have to be self-sus-
taining. If the system-design requires even a 
dime of outside funding, it will eventually collapse. If we are to keep Social Security from going bankrupt, changes must come.
The bi-partisan, eight-member Commis-
sion on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform recommended the single change necessary to fix Social Security. The change? Raise the age from which benefits begin. Representative-elect Cory Gardner, R-4, according to The Coloradoan, opposes increasing the retire-ment age.
This should tell you into what abyss our 
political climate has declined. Shockingly 
enough, George Carlin, Lenny Bruce, Lewis 
Black and the rest were all absolutely correct. We have a party of no ideas, the Democrats; and a party of bad ideas, the Republicans.
If given the opportunity, these two parties 
will work together to ensure their strangle-hold on the power structure remains unchal-lenged. The DISCLOSE Act, likely to come up for vote again during the lame duck session, 
is intended to protect the power structure on 
top of which these two groups of thugs, idiots and buffoons sit.
Here are the pressing concerns every 
American with a three-digit IQ needs to educate themselves about: Medicare, whose unfunded liabilities make the Social Security deficit look like paint damage on the Titanic.

STUDENT LIFE
By LARRY TRUONG
Alligator Contributing Writer 
Cory Weeks sits in a room with 
more than 700 students, each of 
whom paid $25 to be there. 
Most of them have already been 
there three or four times this semes-
ter. A lot of them plan to come back 
another three or four times.
Weeks said every time he goes, 
he laughs so hard he almost forgets he’s there to study for an exam. And maybe that’s the point.
Weeks is one of the countless UF 
students who rely on tutoring cen-ters such as TutoringZone and the Teaching Center instead of their pro-fessors to pass exams and classes.
According to its website, Tutor -
ingZone, at 1010 N. Main St., offers affordable, professional and enter -
taining tutoring for both large and small groups.
Weeks, a freshman majoring in 
electrical engineering, said Tutor -
ingZone has helped him do well on his exams in calculus and chemistry this semester.
“It seems like in my calculus and 
chemistry classes a solid 50 percent 
go to TutoringZone,” he said. “All 
you see is the Smokin’ Notes packets in class, and you know they’ve been to TutoringZone.”Students who attend Tutoring-
Zone sessions are given bright red packets called Smokin’ Notes to study from.
The packets are often more than 
100 pages long and contain study materials for each individual exam for a class.
The Smokin’ Notes are filled with 
examples and practice questions.
“That’s what I like about the 
Smokin’ Notes,” Weeks said. “The examples are talking about partying and celebrities, but it’s related to cal-
culus or whatever the review’s for.”
He said that although he thinks 
the $25 payment for each exam re-
view is high, he will continue to pay for tutoring. He said he knows they are a conducting a business that is very high in demand.
“Even if I had a great professor, 
I would still go because I want to 
make sure I know everything that’s 
going to be on the test,” he said.
Margaret Kelsey , director of 
communications at TutoringZone UF, said she believes the reason why TutoringZone is so popular among students is because of the teaching style.
“It’s effective because we try to 
hire tutors who speak on a very stu-dent level. Pop cultural references and humor are put into the exam-ples. They can relate and think about it in their day-to-day lives.” 
Kelsey said many UF students 
just need to hear the information another time or a different way from their professors. 
“Our bigger classes have atten-
dances of almost 1,000 students per exam,” she said.
UF Provost Joseph Glover, who is 
the senior vice president of student affairs, said he doesn’t think the fact that so many students rely on Tutor -
ingZone reflects poorly on UF.
“It doesn’t make the university 
look bad,” he said. “It shows the students’ desire to do well and their anxiety.”
He said it’s the student’s respon-
sibility to master the materials and the course. How they go about do-ing it is their choice.
“I think that some students find 
those programs useful,” he said. “If 
that’s what the students feel is useful 
and they want to spend the money, they are free to do so.”
Another popular destination for 
UF students who need tutoring is the Teaching Center, located on the ground floor of Broward Hall.
The Teaching Center may be a 
smart option for students struggling 
with classes and money.Unlike TutoringZone, the Teach-
ing Center’s services are free.
“The Teaching Center is obvi-
ously better because it’s free, and we 
offer a lot more subjects,” said Meric Augat, a tutor at the center.
Augat, who has been a tutor for 
two years, said the other centers don’t offer many of the classes the Teaching Center does. As a senior 
mathematics major, he specializes in 
helping students with upper-level math classes such as differential equations, abstract algebra and ad-vanced calculus.
The Teaching Center allows stu-
dents to schedule one-on-one tutor -
ing sessions or walk in for help.  
Civil engineering sophomore Jon 
Wang said the Teaching Center has helped him pass calculus, physics I, chemistry and statics.
“Now I’m here every week be-
cause I have physics II homework due every week,” he said. “If I have a lot of homework due, I’ll come two or three times a week for two hours at a time.”
Wang said he is unable to com-
plete all of his homework without help from tutors because his profes-sors go too quickly and the subject material is very difficult.
The director of the Teaching 
Center, Winifred Cooke, said about 35,000 to 38,000 students receive help from the center each year.
Despite the fact that the Teaching 
Center’s services are free, many stu-dents prefer paying the price for Tu-toringZone because it is less work.
At TutoringZone, the instructors 
go over everything that’s going to be on an exam. At the Teaching Center, students who ask for help are usu-ally required to come prepared with 
specific questions or problems.
“Our goal is mastery of the con-
tent,” Cooke said. “The other places 
are just for preparing for a test. We want long-time learning.”Students lean on study center to pass exams, classes

TEEING OFF WITH KYLE MAISTRIBy TYLER JETT
Alligator Staff Writer
tjett@alligator.org
 
With Florida’s regular season 
over, coach Urban Meyer has 
plenty of time to evaluate how 
his assistant coaches performed this year.
But in the 10 days since UF’s 
31-7 loss to Florida State, Meyer has not made any final decisions. With the exception of defensive line coach Dan McCarney, who left Gainesville to become North 
Texas’ head coach Nov. 30, every 
member of the Gators coaching staff is still with the team.
Graduate assistant Tony Weav-
er will coach Florida’s defensive line Jan. 1 against Penn State in the Outback Bowl.
Perhaps more than any other 
assistant, offensive coordinator 
Steve Addazio has drawn the ire 
of UF fans. After averaging about 43 points in the 2007-08 seasons under then-coordinator Dan Mul-
len, the Gators have averaged 
about 33 points in two seasons under Addazio.
The jeers toward Addazio 
grew loudest as Florida limped 
to a 7-5 regular season record 
while averaging 29.2 points, the team’s worst offensive output since Meyer’s first season at UF 
in 2005.But Addazio will probably be 
calling plays again next season, 
Meyer said Monday.
“I’m expecting that to hap-
pen,” he said. “I will have further 
updates as we get closer to the 
bowl game.”
Offensive changes: Meyer 
would not commit to rotating 
his team’s three quarterbacks in 
the Outback Bowl. To boost their rushing attack, the Gators have used mobile quarterbacks Trey Burton and Jordan Reed in their 
last five games.
The system saw mixed results. 
In Florida’s three wins, the of-
fense scored 45.7 points per game and averaged 492.3 yards. But 
in losses to South Carolina and 
Florida State, UF averaged just 10.5 points and 251 yards.
The three-quarterback system 
ended against its will when Reed 
suffered a concussion in the sec-
ond half against FSU. Although Meyer said the offense will con-tinue to use Burton and John Brantley (and Reed when he re-turns), the team may abandon its 
experiment.
“These next two weeks are crit-
ical,” Meyer said. “I can’t tell you on this day what exactly we’ll do 
in this bowl game. … We’re go-
ing to keep doing the best we can 
to move the ball against this fine defense, and at this point I don’t know what that is.”
But while he acknowledged 
the offense needs a face lift, Mey-

athletes in four and a half years work-ing at the Alligator, but one stands far 
above the rest.
He never gave any dramatic post-game 
speeches. He never had thousands chant-ing his name.
But I’ll never forget him, and I’ll never 
forget the life lesson he taught me.
It’s a story I’ve told many times to stay 
awake on road trips, and in my final col-umn for the Alligator, I’m going to share the time-consuming tale of my friend K.K., 
the UF swimmer, with you.
I arrived at Florida in the summer of 
2006, and within a few weeks, a friend 
introduced me to K.K., who, in the most 
accurate description I can give, was “the 
s***.”
Born in Brazil, K.K. (first name) grew 
up in California. He and his wealthy fam-ily split time between San Francisco and Laguna Beach, where they owned a beach house a few doors down from NBA star La-
mar Odom.
Despite this background, K.K. was one 
of the most open, friendly people I’ve ever 
met, and he rarely flaunted his status — the 
product of an upbringing where his parents 
made him and his brother spend one night a week sleeping on the floor and without electricity to teach them to appreciate what they had.
Soon, K.K. and I were part of a crew that 
did everything together. We went to par -
ties, ate tons of unhealthy food and played basketball at Southwest, where he’d jack up threes and refuse to play defense out of 
fear that an injury would get him in trouble 
with his swim coaches.
He was an endless source of entertain-
ment, from his hard-to-place, laid-back accent, to his bouncy personality, to his urban slang. And he 
never missed an op-
portunity to heckle all the drunk kids as they stumbled off the 
Later Gator outside 
his dorm, Springs.
He seemed to 
know everyone. UF defensive end Jarvis 
Moss was his suite mate, and he had plenty 
of stories about other athletes. 
And of course, the ladies loved him. 
One in particular had his attention, but he 
didn’t want to be tied down and always 
asked for advice on how to handle the 
situation. I never met her, and unsurpris-ingly, my advice sucked. One day, she left a six-page, handwritten letter on his door breaking things off. We all read it; she had colored in the background and listed all the reasons why she cared about him before all 
the reasons they couldn’t stay together.
He left us without our daily dose of en-
tertainment twice that summer: once for a 
swim competition and once when his mom 
was hit by a drunk driver. Other than that, I 
spent a large chunk of my free time chillin’ with K.K. 
I introduced him to my high-school 
friends when they visited. He went out of his way to nurse one back to health after a 
rough night on the town. A few of us were 
planning a Spring Break trip to visit him on the West Coast.
Our friendship lasted into the fall se-
mester, where one day he told me and a friend that his parents had finally agreed to ship his Range Rover from California to No athlete taught me more than the least famous one I met

UF center Azania Stewart has eight points and four rebounds in 
the last two games after five consecutive double-doubles. 
By MATT WATTS
Alligator Writer
 
Florida’s performance this season 
has been somewhat of a puzzle. 
All of the parts are there. It’s now 
become a matter of fitting them to-
gether.
That’s the sentiment surrounding 
UF after suffering a stinging defeat to Brown this past weekend. 
“It’s just a matter of putting (the 
pieces) in the right order so the pic-ture looks the way it’s supposed to,” coach Amanda Butler said. “We’re still just a piece out of joint here, miss-ing a piece there. We’ve got to get 
everyone on the same page. We’ve 
got to continue to find ways to im-prove.”
But time for improvement is of the 
essence. 
Florida (7-2) is back on the court 
tonight at 7 to take on Harvard (4-2) in the O’Connell Center and the opening of Southeastern Conference 
play looms on the horizon. 
Despite limitations in practice 
time, Butler said she expects a quick 
turnaround from her team.
She questioned the players’ ma-turity in the upset loss to Brown and 
said her team needs to prove how se-
rious it is about championships.
“No discredit to Brown, what-
soever, but we played really, really poorly,” Butler said. “I think it was a direct result of lack of leadership and maturity, and I think our team knows that as well. It doesn’t take a coach to figure that out.” 
Florida sports a roster filled with 
inexperience, but Butler said she 
pressures certain players to take on a leadership role. She relies on the point guards, the team’s captains (Azania Stewart 
and Jordan Jones), 
and lone senior Ebonie Crawford to 
set an example.  
But Stewart, who nearly posted 
five consecutive double-doubles in the team’s first six games, has since disappeared. She played a scant 16 minutes against Brown and has com-bined for just eight points and four 
rebounds in her last two games.
“I fully expect her to show a cham-
pion’s response on and off the court,” Butler said. “She knows she’s capable of a bigger leadership role. I think 
we’re going to see a different person when we take the floor [today].”
Harvard should provide more 
than an adequate test for Stewart and the Gators. The Crimson have won five Ivy League championships since 2002 and Butler said they play a smart brand of basketball.
“They are just as you would close 
your eyes and imagine Harvard to be,” Butler said, commending the Crimson’s intelligence. “They’re very well-rounded. Harvard has kind of dominated that league. We’re going to have our hands full, certainly.”
The Gators will have some ad-
ditional pieces to fit back in against 
Harvard as Butler said freshman 
guard Brittany Shine was cleared to play after suffering an ankle injury that kept her out of the team’s last three games. 
Also, the ankle injury that has lim-
ited freshman Jaterra Bonds is inch-ing closer to 100 percent. The two guards are instrumental to Florida’s 
up-tempo style and contributions 
from both will be essential against a talented Harvard team.

Sanders, Marsh undergo surgeries; Reed still being held out of practice
er also blamed the unit’s strug-
gles on its inability to protect the ball. The Gators turned the ball 
over an SEC-high 25 times this 
season.
  “I think you will (see some of-
fensive changes),” Meyer said. 
“It doesn’t matter what type of 
offense you run if you lay the ball on the ground or throw a pick, so that’s No. 1. We’re going to do the best we can to move the 
ball against tradi-tionally one of the best defenses in America, but you’ll 
certainly see some 
changes.”
  Injuries: De-
fensive tackles Terron Sanders (shoulder) and Lawrence Marsh 
(hip) have both undergone sur-
geries since the Florida State game. As of Monday, Reed had yet to practice since suffering a 
concussion. But Meyer said Reed 
“feels great,” and the coach ex-pects him back soon. FOOTBALL , from page 13
Alexander Silva / Alligator Staff
Gainesville after holding it back for his ﬁ  rst two years of 
college. 
  He’d been driving a Jetta that an uncle in Orlando had 
let him borrow, but now he’d have the slick whip he’d shown us pictures of, and he offered to take us for a spin.
  The night his car came in, he told me and a friend to 
meet at his dorm. We showed up, but he didn’t answer his 
phone. Someone else let us in, but the shower was running 
and he didn’t answer his door, so we sat in the lounge.
  Fifteen minutes passed, then 30, and we knocked some 
more. After almost an hour, the water was still running, and he wasn’t answering. Semi-panicked, we told the 
front desk and they called police, who made us wait in the 
stairwell while they entered his room.
  A minute later, the cops were back and said K.K. was 
“totally ﬁ  ne.”
  We left a little confused until I realized I had missed a 
voice mail during the ordeal. 
  It was from K.K.: “Yo, Mad Mike. Did you really just 
call the po-po on me? I had a girl in the shower with me, and the cops came in and scared the **** out of us! I left 
you a message earlier trying to warn you man, this is in-
sane. Well, hit me up tomorrow.”
  He was laughing, and so were we, thinking we’d just 
been part of an epic story. But there was more to come.
  K.K. stopped answering his phone for the next few 
days, and there was no all-black Range Rover in sight out-side his dorm. He told another friend it had been towed, but shortly after, I saw what looked like his Jetta, parked in the usual spot. 
  A friend reminded me K.K.’s stereo knobs were missing, 
and sure enough, the Jetta I saw had the same problem.
  I was confused but didn’t think much of it. Then, fate 
stepped in when I started working at the Alligator.
  My ﬁ  rst beat: swimming.  Much to my surprise, there was no K.K. on the ros-
ter. When I ﬁ  nally talked to him online (his screen name: “swimdude0”), he told me he’d been injured and would be out a few months.
  A mystery was growing, and K.K. was neither seen nor 
heard. One day, I came across his e-mail address on my laptop from when he used it to check Facebook, and I sent it to the friend who introduced us, asking what the odd-
looking word before “@uﬂ  .edu” stood for.
  He checked that address against the roster of a class 
they shared, then sent me the most jarring text message 
I’ve ever received: “His real name is [something complete-ly different from what he said it was].”  I ran home and searched public records for this highly 
unusual last name and found no results in San Francisco. Then I checked Orlando and found that uncle. And I found his parents.
  Turns out, he wasn’t a swimmer, wasn’t from California 
and wasn’t extravagantly wealthy, and his family’s origin was a few thousand miles away from Brazil.
  I tried to call him and ﬁ  nd out what was going on, but 
he ducked me until we crossed paths online. I asked him 
questions, sent him links and tried to understand, but he 
piled on lie after lie and eventually got angry.
  That’s the last time we spoke, and since he wouldn’t 
talk, I started messaging people on Facebook to piece it together. What I heard back ranged from “I can’t believe 
it” to “I always knew he was full of it.” One girl told me 
stories of him trying to pass himself off as a UF athlete to team trainers. 
  Eventually, I found people who went to high school 
with the kid later known as K.K.
  And his on-again, off-again girlfriend? Turns out the 
closest they came to dating was living in the same dorm once. Now, I went from confused and hurt to disturbed. That six-page, handwritten letter with the shaded-in back-
ground and deep feelings was written by K.K. to K.K.
  At this point, any thoughts of salvaging a friendship 
were gone, and I felt upset and betrayed.
  He had constructed a fake persona to make friends, and 
I’m willing to bet there was no girl in the shower with him 
that night. He was hiding.
  The tragedy was that K.K. was an awesome person to 
be around. 
  Money, swimming and country of origin aside, he was 
just cool. But he wasn’t conﬁ  dent enough in himself to just be him.
  Other than an incredibly awkward bus ride we shared 
in silence a year later, I never saw him again. But I’ve seen 
similarities to K.K. almost every day I’ve been in college, 
to a lesser extent.
  People are desperate to be liked, and they spend count-
less amounts of time, energy and money chasing that goal. The nauseating conformity some of our Greek breth-
ren cling to is an easy example, but there are other cases 
around you all the time.
  I struggle with it too, but the K.K. saga taught me that 
we have to be conﬁ  dent enough to really be ourselves. 
Odds are, there’s something unique about you, and that’s 
what attracts real friendship.
  True friends are the ones who care about the real you, 
not the dressed-up fake version you want them to see, and you have to embrace yourself before others can.  If you aren’t the funniest, most interesting, most attrac-
tive person you know, then you have serious issues to sort out.
  Once you get that straight, if people can’t see that, they 
aren’t worth your time. As a wise man once said to me: 
“If she doesn’t want to jump my bones every day she’s 
around me, then I don’t need to be with her.”
  That gem came from a drunken White House employee 
discussing his relationship on the rocks with a few friends, 
two sheriff’s deputies and me ﬁ  ve feet off the track at Mar-
tinsville Speedway the night before a NASCAR race. And that, by far, is the best source I have ever cited.
  And his point is correct. Whether it’s friendship or ro-
mance, if someone can’t see the positives in what you have 
to offer, don’t waste time trying to change their mind.
  I tried to apply that approach to this column during the 
past four years. This may sound selﬁ  sh, but I never wrote 
what I thought you wanted to hear; I wrote what I liked 
and hoped you’d agree.
  To those of you who did agree, thanks for the e-mails, 
Facebook messages and for coming up to me in public (I’ll 
never forget being spotted in line by a misguided soul at Chipotle and praised for my “great insight” or the ﬁ  ve sec-
onds of fame you gave me for an appearance on ESPN). 
  To those of you who can’t stand my corny column name 
and terrible writing, thanks for reading anyway.
  To all of you: Thanks for putting up with my often inco-
herent thoughts, lame attempts at humor and completely 
unnecessary references to my favorite football team, the East Carolina Pirates (one more!).
  To the athletes and coaches I’ve covered: I wouldn’t 
have a job without your hard work, and though I often 
lose sight of that, I try not to.
  To my parents: Thanks for reading a grand total of four 
things I’ve written and for checking this out two weeks 
after I tell you about it. And for paying for everything and 
raising such an impossibly handsome and charming son. 
  To Nick, Joe and Bryan: Thanks for hiring me and teach-
ing me how to write. I’m sorry for failing, but you tried. 
If I make anything of myself, the three of you are huge reasons why.
  To Kyle, thanks for inspiring me to write this column. 
At least the two of us enjoyed it. Anthony, thanks for dedi-cating a massive chunk of space in the paper for it. 
  To everyone else I’ve had the pleasure of working with 
at the Alligator: You were my fraternity, minus the initia-tion by penetration. We shared some amazing experiences, and I’ll try real hard not to forget you when I blow up.
  It’s been real y’all.  Goodbye. MIKE , from page 13Football16, ALLIGATOR n TUESDAY, DECEMBER 7, 2010
