Officials believe two shootings at two 
24-hour restaurants early Saturday morn-
ing may be related. 
After speaking with witnesses, the 
Gainesville Police Department got an arrest 
warrant for Corey Lavon Gregg, 24, who of-
ficials believe may be the shooter in both in-cidents, said GPD spokesman Keith Kameg. Gregg’s bail was posted at $500,000, Kameg said.
The first shooting was at about 2:20 
a.m. at the Krispy Kreme on Southwest 13th Street.
Eugene Harris, 25, of 
Ocala, was standing in the parking lot when a man shot 
at him three times and hit him in the arm, Kameg said.
Kameg said Harris was treated and re-
leased from the hospital. 
The second shooting took place around 
2:45 a.m. at the International House of Pan-cakes on Southwest 13th Street.
An Alachua County Sheriff’s deputy 
heard gunshots when he was going to IHOP as a part of ASO’s routine patrol.
When he arrived at IHOP, he saw people 
run away and cars drive out of the parking lot, said ASO spokesman Steve Maynard.
Officials found Antrawn Bernard Milton, 
25, of Ocala on the ground with a gunshot wound in his leg. Milton was immediately taken to the hospital.

Today is the last day to register 
to vote in the March 24 Gainesville 
city elections.
Two City Commission seats, Dis-
trict 1 and At-Large 1, are up for re-
election. In addition, two city charter 
amendments are on the ballot.
Charter Amendment 1 would le-galize discrimination based on sexu-al orientation or gender identity.
Amendment 2 would require the 
city to obtain voter approval for the sale or conversion of land used for 
conservation, recreation or cultural 
purposes.
To register to vote, visit VoteAla-chua.com or call the Supervisor of Elections at 352-374-5252.
Mail-in voter registration ap-
plications must be postmarked by today. Absentee ballots can be ob-
tained through the Web site or the 
Supervisor of Elections.
Requests to vote by mail are due by March 18.
Voters must be Gainesville resi-
dents to participate in city elections.
Pam Carpenter, Alachua County 
Supervisor of Elections, said it is 
particularly important for students 
to update their registration informa-tion if they have moved in or out of city limits.
“It’s always important for the 
students, as well, to be involved in the local elections,” Carpenter said. “They are living here and the rules, 
the laws, the ordinances are going to 
impact their lives.”

About 80 UF students and faculty 
members marched through campus 
on Friday in protest of the Charter Amendment 1, which would legalize 
discrimination based on sexual orien-
tation. Protesters presented a letter for UF President Bernie Machen in hopes of gaining administrative support for their cause.
The proposed charter will be voted 
on during city elections on March 24, after a local conservative group col-lected enough signatures from regis-tered voters in Alachua County to get 
the issue on the ballot. 
If passed, the legislation could af-
fect Gainesville’s gay community be-
cause it would make discrimination based on sexual identity or sexual ori-
entation legal. 
Employees could be fired, refused 
service at a restaurant or kicked out of 
their home, according to pamphlet is-
sued by Equality is Gainesville’s Busi-
ness, which hosted the protest. 
The rally started on Turlington 
Plaza, where marchers chanted, “Hey, hey, ho, ho, Amendment 1 has got to 
go,” before marching through the Pla-
za of Americas and coming to a halt at Tigert Hall.
Garrett Garner, president of the 
organization, presented a letter to Interim Dean of Students Paige Cran-dall, who met them on the doorsteps of Tigert. The letter was addressed Students, faculty protest Charter 1

the boy shower would require 
locking down a cellblock, most of which hold up to 63 inmates, Adamo said. Elisco said jail officials couldn’t even find clothes to fit the 4-foot-8-inch boy.
“They put a shirt on him; 
he’s swimming in it, and his 
pants are cuffed up about 10 
times,” he said.
Elisco said the boy has not 
confessed to the shooting. He said he didn’t believe the physical evidence would sup-port police’s claim that the boy killed Houk, execution-style, with one shot to the back of 
her head.

Family seeks guardian -
ship of attack victim 
HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — 
The family of a woman who was mauled by a 200-pound chimpanzee says her twin brother plans to go to court this 
week to seek guardianship of 
the victim and her daughter.
“That’s the way my sister 
would want it,” Steve Nash said of his younger sister, 55-year-old Charla Nash, who remains under sedation at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, where she is being evaluated 
by teams of physicians.

slaying suspect, 11 
PITTSBURGH (AP) — A jail 
warden said Sunday he will ask 
a judge to move an 11-year-old boy accused of killing his fa-ther’s pregnant girlfriend from 
an adult lockup to a juvenile 
detention center because the jail cannot accommodate the boy.
Lawrence County Warden 
Charles Adamo said his 300-in-mate jail cannot offer proper long-term care for Jordan Brown, of Wampum, who was charged Saturday with using his own 
20-gauge shotgun to kill 26-year-
old Kenzie Marie Houk.
Houk was eight months preg-
nant with the child of Brown’s father and also had two daugh-ters, ages 4 and 7, who lived to-gether in the rural home where authorities said she was slain as she lay in bed Friday.
Police said the boy then 
hopped onto a school bus with Houk’s oldest daughter. State troopers picked him up at school after tree trimmers called 911 when Houk’s youngest daugh-ter told them she thought her mother was dead.
The boy has been held in a 
jail about 45 miles northwest of Pittsburgh since early Saturday, Adamo said. Brown faces a pre-liminary hearing on Thursday to determine if he’ll stand trial. He was charged as an adult be-cause Pennsylvania law allows prosecutors to charge children as young as 10 with criminal ho-
micide.
Brown’s attorney, Dennis 
Elisco, said he planned to file 
motions on Monday asking a judge to move the case to juve-nile court and to let the boy’s fa-ther post bail so the boy can be freed.
“I want him to be occupied 
and busy and back, essentially, in school,” Elisco said.
Adamo said the boy was be-
ing held in one of four 10-by-8-foot cells in the jail’s booking area, where officials check on him every 15 minutes.
He said the boy cannot re-tion to make decisions on behalf 
of Charla and her 17-year-old 
daughter, Briana, who is staying with family friends in Connecti-cut, Steve Nash told The Associ-ated on Sunday.
Charla Nash was transferred 
from Stamford Hospital in Con-necticut to Ohio with massive injuries to her face and hands 
from the Feb. 16 attack by Tra-
vis, a chimpanzee owned by her friend, 70-year-old Sandra Her-old of Stamford.
“She’s stabilized and the 
evaluation process is going to take a long time. It’s a slow pro-cess,” said Steve Nash, who is with his sister in Ohio.
Nash said he’s hopeful the 
physicians will speak publicly about his sister’s condition later this week. Doctors haven’t de-cided if she will be a candidate for a face transplant at the clinic, where the first face transplant in the U.S. was performed two months ago.
Nash, who lives in Virginia, 
said he doesn’t know Herold or many details about the case.
“Our focus is on our sister. 
We haven’t said one or two words about her,” he said, refer-ring to Herold.
Herold, who owned the d 
chimp for nearly all his life, has 
said she fed Travis the finest 
foods, including steak, lobster, cheesecake and wine. Travis combed her hair and they slept in the same bed, she said.

It starts with a flirt. 
It’s not as nerve-wracking as it 
seems. 
It only takes the click of a button. But who knows? Soon it might 
lead to a Facebook friendship, a phone chat, a date or a relationship. 
DownToEarth.com is a dating Web site geared toward college stu-dents, and it is the seventh largest free dating site, said Jacob Solotaroff, the site’s general manager.
Since its launch in January, the 
site has attracted more than 100,000 daters, with 1,500 people joining daily, he said.
There are 200 Gainesville singles 
on the site and more than 2,000 within two-and-a-half hours of the city, Sotolaroff said. There are more than  23,000 people between 18 and 25, he said. 
“As a college student you’re a lot 
more likely to meet someone going online than if you go to parties with the same people or the same popular bar that you went to the last several weekends in a row,” he said.
When the site’s construction be-
gan in 2008, there weren’t any clean, free dating sites, Sotolaroff said. 
“I was shocked when I first found 
out that on some major free sites you 
can say you are married right on the 
registration form,” he said. “They’re actively encouraging cheating.”While the site monitors lewd be-
havior, members also report each other through a rating system.
After daters meet, they can rate 
the accuracy of each other’s profiles. UF student Kaitlyn Cava said she had never thought about joining a dating Web site. 
“I might if it was a student pro-
gram where I would have the op-portunity to meet men I actually have commonalities with,” she said.

� MACHEN AND THE BOARD SEEK 
TO IMPROVE RESEARCH STATUS.
By THOMAS STEWART

Lake Wauburg glistened in the morning 
sun and a faint fire flickered in the Lake Cy-
press Lodge’s stone fireplace as UF’s Board of Trustees, the university’s highest governing body, got down to the gritty business of bud-
get cuts on Friday.
Prompted by UF President Bernie Machen 
to decide where UF’s priorities should lie 
when it makes millions of dollars in cuts this summer, the board told Machen they want UF’s mission to focus more on graduate edu-cation.
“Do we wanna be the best undergraduate 
university in the nation, or do we wanna be the best research university in the nation?” asked Trustee Earl Powell. “That’s the ques-tion here.”
Powell said the graduate programs that at-
tract the most grant money should be at the core of UF’s mission.
“Because the rubber meets the road when 
the government sends you money to produce 
programs,” he said, adding that UF has no 
trouble attracting undergraduate students.
Trustee Joelen Merkel agreed.“Undergraduates don’t really need our fo-
cus that we’ve given them the last, you know, eight years,” Merkel said. “They are going to be here.”
Trustee Roland Daniels argued focusing on graduate programs would also benefit under-graduates.
“If we can prioritize in terms of the research 
mission that we have, the undergraduates will improve, as well, in time,” he said.
But Trustee and Student Body President 
Kevin Reilly said he was concerned trustees were taking UF’s undergraduates for granted and said he didn’t want UF to lose its identity.
“I think the undergraduate 
culture is what drives a lot of 
the campus culture,” he said. “I 
think if we lose that mission too much, we lose a lot of what is 
the University of Florida.”
Machen assured trustees that UF wasn’t 
abandoning its undergraduates.
“We are not walking away from a commit-
ment to undergraduate education,” he said. “We can’t.”
But he said the state’s community colleges 
are offering more and more four-year degrees, tempting potential undergraduates with bar-gain prices.
“It’s a Kmart education, but they are gon-
na do it,” he said, adding UF could compete against them but questioned why it would want to.
“Why don’t we move on to a more special-
ized market?” he asked.
Machen said the move would involve ex-
panding UF’s reach throughout the state with new research centers.
Trustees agreed, however, that UF’s new 
persona could be a tough sell.
“I think 95 percent of the people in this state 
have no appreciation for graduate education,” said Trustee Dianna Morgan. Trustees, Machen want UF to focus on grad programs

HONOLULU — Hawaii, the state 
that adopted the nation’s first “de-
fense of marriage” constitutional 
amendment a decade ago, has now 
become the latest battleground in the 
fight for same-sex civil unions.
It would become the fifth state to 
legalize the alternative to gay mar-
riage if the Democrat-dominated 
Legislature and Republican gover-nor approve a civil union law. The measure was passed by the state House this month but it now faces 
the Senate, where a divided commit-
tee is to vote Tuesday.
Republican Gov. Linda Lingle has 
declined to comment on the issue and it’s unclear whether she would 
veto the bill.
Gay rights organizations argue 
that civil unions would promote ba-
sic equality in the nation’s most eth-nically diverse state, but opponents 
fear the erosion of an island culture 
that values conventional family ties.
“Society in general is becoming 
more accepting,” said Suzanne King, 
a real estate office manager who is 
raising her 9-year-old daughter, Shy-
lar Young, with her partner of nearly 28 years, Tambry Young. “It’s not 
unusual to come upon a gay family. 
There isn’t this fear that by giving us rights, it’s going to reduce the tradi-tional family.”
King and Young said they want 
a civil union law so gay couples can more easily adopt children, share health benefits and gain hospital visitation rights. They plan to enter 
into a civil union if the measure be-
comes law.
Religious groups have been tak-
ing out newspaper ads, setting up Web sites and holding rallies urging lawmakers to preserve traditional marriage.
The Mormon church, which cam-
paigned in California last year for a gay marriage ban, has not openly 
rallied opposition to civil unions in 
Hawaii this year. 
But some members of the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints have been sharing e-mails urging 
people to calls their legislators op-
posing the bill.
“In Hawaii, people still believe in 
traditional marriage and the sanctity of marriage,” said Dennis Arakaki, executive director of the Hawaii 
Family Forum, 
which also repre-
sents the Hawaii Catholic Confer-ence. “There’s no in-
dication that values or perspectives 
have changed.”
Only Massachusetts and Connect-
icut allow gay marriage, while Ver-
mont, Connecticut, New Jersey and New Hampshire allow civil unions. 
Californians voted in November to 
overturn a court ruling that allowed gay marriage, but the state still offers domestic partnerships that guaran-tee the same rights as marriage.
That means Hawaii could be-
come the only Western state to give governmental blessing to same-sex 
unions.
“Our wedding industry would 
have a huge potential increase in 
business purely because there are people who would rather come to 
the islands rather than go to the 
East Coast to have a civil union per-formed,” said the Rev. Mike John Hough of Kauai Island Weddings.
“Some people say it’s just mar-
riage by another name, and that may be true. It’s a perfect compromise.”4, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, FEBRUARY 23, 2009

Watch out, college students — 
there are some smart high-schoolers 
in Alachua County moving into the spotlight.
Forty students at five Alachua County high schools qualified as finalists in the National Merit Schol-arship Program, setting a district record with seven more finalists than last year, according to an Ala-chua County Public Schools news release.
More than half of the 40 finalists were from Eastside High School, and Principal Jeff Charbonnet attri-butes the school’s success to the In-ternational Baccalaureate program offered there.
“Our students are simply pre-
pared with a high-quality educa-
tion,” he said.Finalists also came from Buch-
holz,  Gainesville, Loften and Santa 
Fe High Schools.
In order to participate in the 
program, students must be among the highest national scorers on the Preliminary SAT/National Merit 
Scholarship Qualifying Test (PSAT/NMSQT). 
The committee also evaluates 
academic records, school curricula, 
recommendations from school offi-cials, leadership and activities, and essays written by the finalists, who last year received more than $36 mil-
lion in scholarships.

� NEW GENETIC TESTING HELPS  
DETERMINE DOSAGE FOR WARFARIN.
By REBECCA WEISS
Alligator Contributing Writer 
Doctors prescribing Warfarin, a blood-
thinning medication, will now be able to use 
genetic testing as a means of estimating the initial dosage size for their patients. 
Data collected from 350 patients at Shands 
at UF and the Malcolm Randall VA Medical Center were combined with other interna-tional studies to show that a person’s genes play a role in how the drug will affect their blood flow.
Warfarin is an anti-coagulant, also known 
as a blood thinner, which helps to prevent clot formation in the blood and is given to those who are at risk for blood clots.  Warfa-
rin works by inhibiting Vitamin K-dependent 
factors in the body, which contains proteins that deal with blood clotting. 
According to Julie Johnson, director for 
UF’s Center for Pharmacogenomics, about two million Americans are currently taking Warfarin.
“Figuring out the right dose for the right 
person can be really tricky,” she said.  “The 
dose required can range from 1 milligram 
per day to 10 or 15 milligrams per day.”
Patients are normally started off with a 5 
milligram per day dose, which is then adjust-ed after seeing how the body and blood flow reacts to the medicine.
However, problems arise when patients 
are given too much or too little of the medi-cine. If a patient is given too much, they have 
a period of increased risk of fatal bleeding. 
But, if they are not given enough, they have an increased risk of clot formation, which can lead to a stroke.
“Warfarin is a difficult drug, although it’s 
used in lots of patients,” said Dr. Marc Zum-berg, clinical assistant professor of medicine in the division of Hematology and Oncology at UF’s College of Medicine, who was not in-
volved in the study. “The dose is dependent 
on a lot of things such as diet and use of dif-ferent medications.”
For these reasons, Zumberg said patients’ 
blood levels often fluctuate, causing dosage 
amount to change as well.
“We have to follow their levels very close-
ly,” he said.
The study showed variations of two genes 
could control how much of an initial dosage 
a patient would need, thus eliminating most of the guesswork done when initially pre-scribing medicine to the patients.
“One of the genes makes the protein that 
metabolizes Warfarin in the liver, affecting how quickly or slowly it will break the drug down,” Johnson said.  “The other gene makes the protein that the Warfarin acts on, and so, it influences how much protein is present.”
The more protein present in the body, the 
higher amount of Warfarin needed.
About 46 percent of the patients in the 
study benefitted from these genetic tests be-
cause they did not need the average 5 milli-
grams of Warfarin usually prescribed.
“Some people require less than 3 milli-
grams or greater than 7 milligrams,” Johnson said.  “It’s a pretty significant overdose or underdose.”
Zumberg said genetic variations indicate 
a part, but not all, of how much doctors need to prescribe.  He believes a patient’s diet and use of other medication also plays a role in detrimining dosage.
“I’m not convinced it’s a huge gain yet,” 
he said. “I think it will get you to the right dose quicker, but I’m not convinced how quickly you’ll get the information.”
Zumberg’s biggest concerns are cost ef-
fectiveness and turn around time for test re-sults He believes that doctors should use the genetic information if it’s readily available, “but it’s not the end-all and be-all of Warfa-rin,” he said.Testing benefits new drugVotes held on civil unions

Gov. Charlie Crist unveiled his $66.5 billion budget pro-
posal for the 2009-2010 fiscal year on Friday.
Under his proposal, the state’s universities will get almost 
$3.6 billion, including tuition revenues, which is about $270 
million more than the amount set aside by the current year’s budget, according to Crist’s budget Web site.
The amount includes about $131 million from the econom-
ic stimulus bill signed by President Barack Obama last week.
His budget is only a recommendation. The real budget is 
determined by the Florida Legislature during its spring session, which runs from March 3 to May 1.
The total budget is about $1 billion bigger 
than the current year’s budget, according to the site.
Crist is expecting $4.7 billion in stimulus money next year 
and $12.2 billion over three years.
Crist also proposes a base tuition increase of 5 percent for 
the state’s universities and community colleges.
All universities, but not community colleges, will have the 
right to raise tuition by up to 15 percent if a tuition bill passed by the Senate’s Higher Education Committee last week be-
comes law. It would affect almost all students who enrolled 
after July 1, 2007.MONDAY, FEBRUARY 23, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 5

Although construction began 
in December, about 90 people at-
tended the official groundbreaking ceremony on Saturday for William R. Hough Hall, a $23 million build-
ing being constructed for graduate 
business students at UF. 
The event featured speeches 
from UF President Bernie Machen, as well as UF alumnus Bill Hough, whose $30 million donation funded the 70,000-square-foot building.  
Later Hough and Machen 
donned construction hats and held 
golden shovels to pose for pictures. 
They were also joined by Hough’s family and UF mascots Albert and 
Alberta. 
Hough said the name of the 
building is intended to honor Wil-
liam R. Hough & Co., the invest-ment banking firm he founded af-ter graduating with UF’s first MBA class in 1948. 
The three-story building will 
include meeting rooms, student 
lounges, and larger hallways and 
other open areas, where students and faculty can talk after lectures, said Howie Ferguson, the assistant director and senior project manager of UF Facilities Planning & Con-struction.
“So, there’s a lot of very thought-ful spaces in this building beyond 
the classrooms,” Ferguson said. 
Rick Rowe of Rowe Architects, a 
company involved with the project, 
said Hough Hall, which is located at the northeast end of campus by the Southwest 13th Street entrance, will also have five classrooms and two seminar rooms.
Rowe mentioned other features, 
such as a central court, a catering area, a board room and a financial market lab.
The building, which will be 
LEED certified and energy efficient, is expected to open in fall 2010.
Because it is located near historic 
buildings such as Bryan Hall, the structure’s design will be modern yet respectful of its historical con-text, Rowe said.
While Ferguson noted the facil-
ity’s value as a tool for recruiting and retaining faculty and students, he said the building has led to the loss of about 118 parking spots. 
A new parking garage will be 
built that will make up for this loss, he said.Still, UF student Kevin Mesmer,  
who is pursuing a master’s degree in finance, said he is looking for-ward to the building’s completion because it will provide a home for graduate business students.
Currently, the students have 
no building to call their own, he said, and their classes are scattered around everywhere.
In his speech at the event, Ma-
chen recognized other important opportunities the building will cre-ate.
He said the building represents 
a chance to train the new business leaders of tomorrow and serves as a great symbol during a time when the business community is in need 
of some new leadership.
In addition, Machen said, as con-
struction at universities across the 
country grinds to a halt,  the new building shows UF is continuing to move forward.
“We’re going to keep doing the 
things that make us the flagship for this state,” he said. 
In an interview before his 
speech, Machen pointed to the eco-nomic implications of the current construction.  
“It shouldn’t be lost that, at a 
time of real economic difficulty, we found the resources to put up a new academic building that will benefit students and faculty,” he said.

the things that make us

Today’s question: Do loud cell phone conversations annoy you?Put aside apathy, vote in SG electionsColumn
Friday’s question:  Do friends let friends spray tan?
229 TOTAL VOTES28% YES72% NOMaking Progress
Party appeals to best 
interest of students
The final days of the pamphlet-pushing party loyalists 
haranguing me on Turlington Plaza to vote for their can-didate in the impending Student Government election are upon us. They do a marvelous job, those pamphlet push-ers, because once again I’m devoting another 500 words to their collective cause. 
As I expressed last week, our officials in SG can’t be 
taken very seriously when only 10 to 15 percent of their constituents vote them into office. Consequentially, if no one really votes for them, then what power do they truly hold? 
The position becomes a vanity, a simple check on a re-
sume, a mere pre-audition before stepping into the dis-cerning glares of Simon, Paula, and Randy, aka the voting populace of local and even state politics. 
But those are all valid reasons to run, as long as you 
keep your constituents views close to heart. Together, they 
manage more than $14 million for thousands of UF stu-
dents. Nearly everything you touch or come across as a student at UF has some affiliation with SG. Regional Tran-sit System buses? SG. Funding for the litany of student organizations? SG. Gov. Sarah Palin was qualified for the vice presidency on fewer responsibilities!
So why, then, do so few of us vote? Besides our notorious laziness as college students and 
the lack of online voting, the most salient reason why so few will vote in the next two days is that there are scarcely any ideological differences between the parties. Ideologi-cal differences are what make American politics entertain-ing. Who cares about the issues and proposed solutions when we can bicker over abortion and the differences be-tween conservative and liberal ideologies? 
Arguably, the same holds true for politics at the uni-
versity level. Few voters care about who came up with the idea of converting the UF Web mail system to Gmail first, or whose idea it was to propose a new parking garage for stu-dents. Instead, most of us con-cern ourselves with the petty bickering between the parties - an art that in this election cycle the Orange and Blue Party has perfected, leaving the Unite Party to rise above the trifling 
fray. 
Most of us engaged enough to vote aren’t driven to the 
polls because of the issues, but because of the screaming 
headlines on this very paper that alert us to the manifold of election complaints filed by the parties each week. 
In this ideological vacuum, what’s left but petty dis-
course? Perhaps Alligator columnist Johnathan Lott was correct last Thursday when he endorsed “your friend” for the election. Who else can you vote for when one or more parties change or emerge each cycle? Ideas are cheap, but political theatrics sell. 
I can only hope that in the wake of President Barack 
Obama’s historic campaign, which shook hundreds of thousands of young Americans out of our natural politi-cally apathetic state, this SG election will see a higher turn-out than in years past. 
I wouldn’t mind seeing some vindication for the Turl-
ington Plaza pamphlet-pushers, and I think I’ll miss their determined countenance come Thursday. For my other alternative is another cockeyed and anonymous angry preacher damning me to eternal hellfire as I walk to class. 
Matthew Christ is a political science freshman. His column 
appears on Mondays.
It may not be “sexy,” but one Student Government par-
ty doesn’t care how their platform will look on a campaign 
poster.
Billing itself as the party with a vested interest in “getting 
it done,” the Progress Party’s not-made-for-TV key points 
offer UF students something rarely associated with SG – a 
chance for results. For this and other reasons, the Alligator endorses the Progress Party in this semester’s SG elections.
With a self-proclaimed “defensive-minded” financial ap-
proach to handling the SG budget, Progress seeks to remedy the currently inefficient method in which campus groups re-ceive funding.
Under its plan, an online database will be developed to 
track how organizations utilize monies allocated to them 
from SG to cut down on unnecessary spending that could be 
budgeted elsewhere.
Currently, SG relies upon a three-ring binder as the sole 
record of how the money is being divided – an antiquated approach that may breed error and dishonesty.
Progress hopes to create a budget task force to electroni-
cally monitor how a group uses its funding so that organi-zations that do not demonstrate growth are not automati-cally provided funding year after year. If implemented, these 
seemingly small changes could potentially net SG $100,000 
–  not to mention a sound archiving system that doesn’t stand a chance to be lost or stolen. By embracing technology, the Progress Party will be able to forge a greater bond with the currently isolated SG outsiders who feel a sense of discon-nect.
Another crucial component to Progress’s platform stems 
from its desire to increase “insourcing” on the UF campus. This would place greater emphasis on providing grants, jobs 
and contracts to students instead of looking beyond The Gator 
Nation to outside sources. Instead of a private company de-veloping GPS technology for on-campus transportation, an “insourcing” approach would have called for engineering students to receive a grant to develop the product. This ap-proach could also be used to save UF money, for example by using computer science students to implement wireless Internet in dorms instead of paying an outside contractor.
Beyond the scope of its platform, Progress made clear  
its selfless intentions if elected to SG office. The candidates aren’t running to pad their resumes with hopes of landing at top-notch law school or to rub elbows with Bernie in his private box at a Gators game – in fact, if elected, candidate for Student Body President Ben Dictor will sell the tickets and donate money to charity. Simply put, Progress seeks to en-sure that your Activity and Service fees are being put to the most efficient use possible.
The Progress Party does not stand for an anti-Greek ver-
sus Greek mentality or employing exclusionary tactics with regard to who can be a part of their mission. Rather, Prog-ress looks to recruit individuals based upon what they can offer in terms of making necessary change for the good of the entire Student Body. Whether you are Greek or a computer geek, Progress will welcome you with open arms so long as you are a hardworking and intelligent individual. 
What impresses the Editorial Board most about Ben Dic-
tor and his running mates is their honest-to-goodness hope to bring people together. We were struck by their sincere in-tentions of having the best interests of the students at heart, rather than the tired practice of sticking to party lines and 
partisan bickering. You won’t find empty promises of a park-
ing garage that will never be built or the elimination of on-campus newspaper programs, but rather blue-collar grit that will demand transparency and newfound cohesiveness.

Letter to the Editor
Johnson’s memorial proposal offensive
During the closing arguments of the Stu-
dent Government debate, Unite Party’s Jordan 
Johnson proposed the creation of a memo-rial at the Reitz Union to showcase “minor-ity achievements.” He touted this project as a positive step forward in the advancement of diversity on campus. 
As the former president of the Cuban 
American Student Association at UF and an active member in the Hispanic community, I am offended at Johnson’s proposal. 
Creating a memorial to show that people 
“that look like you” can also achieve on cam-pus is patronizing and condescending. 
It segregates the student body and sets mi-
nority students apart from the unified Gator 
Nation. A true celebration of diversity is the 
acknowledgement that we are all members of 
one community; our achievements shouldn’t be qualified as coming from Hispanics, Afri-can-Americans, Asian Americans, or Cauca-
sians. 
At a time when the President of the United 
States is a member of a minority group, John-
son should know that true diversity means working together and moving forward for 
progress, not separating students by race.
I hope students from all backgrounds come 
together and make it clear to Jordan Johnson that creating false dichotomies in the student 
body is not the right way to celebrate diversity 
on campus.  All members of this student body 
should celebrate our achievements together, 
not according to our individual ethnicities and cultural backgrounds. While I am sure John-son had the best intentions in his proposal, he 
missed the point.

What is it that’s so frus-
trating about listening 
to only one side of a con-
versation? 
I can sit – sometimes even com-
placently – between two people having a conversation on the bus. In this situation I’m at least privy 
to what’s going on, have a sense of wholeness, can chime in when 
relevant and even glean some in-sight into a stranger’s mind.
It’s listening to half of a phone 
conversation on the bus that near-
ly kills me. The peeve finally hit 
its pinnacle when I had to listen to a girl try to describe the Oaks Mall extremely loudly to her ostensibly 
deaf friend:
“The mall. The place with 
stores. On University. (Actually, it’s on Newberry). Where people 
like to go shopping. mall. mall. mall. mall.”
After listening to what was ba-
sically a game of Taboo devoid of 
any enjoyment, I was then subject-
ed to listening to a conversation about going to the Swamp (she was so excited that she said “cool beans”) and an entire narration of 
the bus ride’s events (minus me 
blatantly mouthing “hang up”).  
The thing is, 90 percent of all p h o n e 
conver-
sations I overhear 
are this 
uninter-
esting and pathetic.
Why do people feel the need 
to talk on the phone about in-
nate shit? Try an iPod or a book 
– something edifying. There’s no situation that requires you to call someone on a bus apart from be-ing a character in “Jeepers Creep-
ers 2” or “Speed.”
Text messaging is another al-
ternative. With a quick staccato of your index fingers and thumbs you can avoid screaming in my 
ears and making an ass out of yourself at the same time. 
I understand that we were 
raised when self-esteem psychol-ogy was popular among parents and educators, but do you need to 
stay affirmed so badly that you’re willing to permanently attach a 
phone to your ear?
When I was seven, there was a 
Goosebumps book I liked in which one of the “choose your own end-
ings” lands you R.L. Stine’s ver-
sion of Hell -- watching George Washington cross the Potomac for eternity. It was probably my 
favorite Goosebumps book, but I 
had a hard time buying that any-one could consider sitting and ob-
serving more torturous than fire 
and brimstone. 
I’ve since realized that spend-
ing 40 minutes listening to you 
describe what you’re wearing to your next sorority function is an 
entirely plausible candidate for my conception of ultimate suffer-ing. So please, have some mercy and hang up the phone.

Hopeful artists must first garner a fol-
lowing before attracting a record label in 
today’s music climate, said an attorney 
and musician at a conference Saturday.
Musicians, music managers and attor-
neys held discussion panels to help people who aspire to be in the music industry un-
derstand the business side at the Seventh 
Annual UF Music Law Conference at the Levin College of Law.
David Beame, an attorney, manager 
and musician, said musicians now have to do more work up-front in order to get noticed.
“Major labels don’t have that money anymore,” he said. “They’re not sign-
ing things unless you get the work done.”
A musician needs to be 
ready before finding a man-
ager, he said.
“It’s about hustlin’ your ass off,” he 
said.
Martin Atkins, who has worked with Nine Inch Nails and owns a record compa-
ny, said he believes the old music industry 
model is dead and welcomes new changes through avenues like Creative Commons licensing, a copyright method that allows 
anybody the right to use the  music. 
“I think it gives legal access to people to 
do cool stuff,” he said. “It can breathe life 
into original material.” Musicians, attorneys examine new music industry
to UF President Bernie Machen and expressed student and staff opposition to the legislation, en-
couraging administrators to take 
an active stance against it. 
UF librarian Flo Turcotte said 
she participated in the march 
because the charter, if passed, 
would create a hostile climate in Gainesville.
“When one person’s rights are 
taken away, everyone is threat-
ened,” she said. “It doesn’t have 
to affect you directly for you to become concerned.” 
UF anthropology senior 
Loren Jones agreed and said Gainesville residents should care about maintaining equality. 
“(Gainesville) will hurt its 
reputation as an open and wel-
come community,” she said, 
adding that Machen’s support is vital.
“Unfortunately, students’ 
voices don’t seem to be heard,” she said. “We want an admin-istration who speaks on our be-half. He has credibility. His sup-port will go a long way.”
Garner said he wanted UF’s 
administration to join alongside the faculty senate and the stu-dent senate, which both passed resolutions last week speaking out against the legislation. 
Many of the protesters sported 
Student Government party shirts and took a break from campaign-ing for upcoming SG elections to march.
Orange and Blue Party Sen. 
Ben Cavataro, who co-authored the student senate resolution against Charter to Amendment 
1, took part in the protest. 
He said students should take 
an active interest in citywide is-
sues. 
“We don’t live in a bubble,” 
Cavataro said. “What the city does affects UF.”
UF English senior Andrew 
Hix, who also participated in 
the rally, said it is important for 
students to vote in the city elec-tions.
He said the legislation was 
reminiscent of racially discrimi-
natory actions from the 1960s.
“It took a lot of money and 
time to do something that 
shouldn’t have been done in the 
first place,” he said. “This issue 
represents a serious backslide in civil rights.”Charter 1 to raise hostilityOnCampu s

ON TELEVISION TODAY IN UF SPORTS HISTORYBy MIKE  DiFERDINANDO
Alligator Staff Writer
mdiferdinando@alligator.org
For the first time this season, Nick Cal-
athes didn’t steal the show.
And for the first time all year, he didn’t 
have to.
The Gators had five players score in 
double figures and shot a season-best 61.2 
percent from the field during their 82-68 win against Vanderbilt (16-10, 5-7 Southeastern Conference) on Saturday.
It was the Gators’ (21-6, 8-4 SEC) most 
complete game of the season, and with the race for the SEC still wide open, one they had to have.
The victory extended UF’s home win-
ning streak to 17 games.
Alex Tyus (10 points) and Kenny Kadji (7 
points) dominated the paint, Erving Walker 
knocked down open threes and Dan Werner 
didn’t miss.
Walker, who scored 10 of UF’s last 17 
points, led the Gators with a team-high 17 
points.
“Nick, we know he’s our go-to guy, and 
he’s led us in a lot of big games, but I think we needed a game like this,” Walker said.
UF started fast, holding Vanderbilt to 
only 2 points in the game’s first 8:15 and jumped out to an early 12-2 lead.
Dan Werner had his best shooting night 
of the season, finishing with 11 points, and was a perfect 4 for 4 from the field.
“You try to figure out what they can do, but they just have a lot of weapons,” Van-derbilt coach Kevin Stallings said. “When all of their weapons are playing well, it’s hard.”
The Gators, who came into Saturday’s 
game last in the SEC in blocked shots, sent back seven against the Commodores — four of which came courtesy of Kadji.
“Kadji’s blocks were legitimate. The oth-
ers, I think they probably just tripped and fell into our guys who happened to have their hands up,” UF coach Billy Donovan joked. “Dan Werner had one, too. I’d like to go back and see that play.”
Calathes scored 33 points a week ago 
against Kentucky and came within one re-bound of a triple-double against Georgia in the following game.
The Gators lost both of those contests.Saturday, the sophomore deferred to his 
teammates, and UF played arguably its best basketball of the season.
“(Nick has) carried our team, but it’s 
good some of the other guys stepped up and carried the load,” Donovan said. “He

�UF SWEPT LOUISVILLE 3-0.
By BOBBY CALLOVI

Clayton Pisani had not scored a 
run, and Mike Mooney had not re-
corded a hit all series against No. 23 Louisville. Then came the bottom of the ninth Sunday.
Down to the final out before the 
game ended in a tie, Pisani lined a single to center field, and catcher Buddy Munroe followed him with a two-strike single to right. Then, 
Mooney, 0 for 7 against Louisville to 
that point, walked to the plate and hit the game-winning single into left field.
“When it came 
off the bat, I thought I got under it a little bit because I did my first two at-bats,” 
the freshman said. 
“I guess I got enough of it, and the wind helped me out. I don’t know, 
but it ended up good.”
The final game of the series pro-
vided more drama than the first two, ending in a 3-2 victory for UF (3-0). The first two games of the weekend resulted in easy Gators wins, 6-3 on 
Friday and 10-4 on Saturday.
But all three displayed dominant efforts by UF starting pitchers, in-
cluding premier outings from two freshmen.
Alex Panteliodis (1-0, 3.00 ERA) 
went six innings and gave up only 2 runs Saturday. Not to be outdone, fellow newcomer Nick Maronde 
lasted 6 1/3 innings and allowed 
Mooney’s walk-off hit completes season-opening sweep
One of my favorite movie scenes is the 
Blues Brothers clip where Jake (John Belushi) begs to avoid the wrath of 
his former girlfriend.
To explain why he left her standing at the 
altar, Jake uses this litany of excuses: He ran out of gas, had a flat tire, didn’t have money for a cab, his tux didn’t come back from the cleaners, an old friend visited, his car was sto-len and there was an earthquake, a flood and locusts.
Pretty impressive 
list. But nowadays, it seems like people only need to say two words to justify an action: budget con-straints. “The econ-omy” works just as 
well.It puts an end to discussion in almost any 
situation. Seriously, try it with your friends.
“Dude, you’ve owed me five bucks for 
like a month. Where’s my money?”
“Sorry man, budget restraints are kicking 
in. You know, the economy and stuff.”
“Yeah bro, it’s really hard out here right 
now. Take your time.”
That’s basically what the Florida Senate 
used to justify ending steroid testing in state high schools, and in this case, I don’t think it flies.
Last summer, the Senate opted not to re-
new House Bill 461, which required the Flor-ida High School Athletic Association to run a one-year program that randomly tested one percent of athletes in football, baseball, soft-ball or weightlifting for anabolic steroids.
The program, which cost $100,000, test-

Sha Brooks and Marshae Dotson had 
that look in their eyes — the one that says 
they’re not going to be denied.
For two seniors who have been the life-
blood of the program for the past four years, 
it could not have been any other way.
Brooks and Dotson, along with fellow 
seniors Aneika Henry and Kim Critton, led 
No. 15 UF (23-5, 9-4 Southeastern Confer-ence) on Senior Day to an 82-66 win against South Carolina (10-15, 2-10 SEC) in the O’Connell Center on Sunday.
They won’t soon forget it, either.“I don’t think it would’ve really mattered 
who we played today,” UF coach Amanda Butler said. “This group right here, in par-ticular, that was disappointed last year on Depree (Bowden)’s Senior Night knew how important this was. That’s what you want from your seniors is a sense of urgency.
“There was a very confident little twin-
kle in their eye before we took the court, no doubt.”
The Gators avenged last season’s Senior 
Day loss to the Gamecocks, sending this year’s group out on top. They compiled a 14-1 record on their home court this season.
Brooks totaled 24 points, eight assists and 
six rebounds, while Dotson added 18 points and five rebounds, and each provided the leadership their team needed.
None of it came easy.
South Carolina kept UF scurrying much 
of the game with its physical, aggressive 
play, cutting the Gators’ lead to 3 with about 13 minutes left and vying for the up-set again. Any hope the Gamecocks had of a comeback was dashed when Brooks turned a 3-point play into 4 after making a three, getting fouled and sinking a free throw with 1:20 remaining.
“I was just thinking, if (Lonnika Thomp-
son) can get me this ball, then I’m going to hit the shot, and she did, and I got fouled,” Brooks said. “It was a great motivation for our team.”
Guard Kim Critton entered the game for 
the first time with 2:11 remaining, and all four seniors were then taken off the court together one final time to a standing ovation with 21 seconds left.
“It’s what they deserve,” Butler said. 
“They put in so much time and so much energy and give up so much of themselves, their bodies on a daily basis, the commit-ment and dedication. It was, no doubt, their moment.”
Many of the fans stuck around for a 
post-game ceremony recognizing the se-niors and all their accomplishments, which 
were enough to leave the public address an-
nouncer catching his breath afterward.
“I’m glad we went out with a bang,” 
Dotson said. “We had fun out there, we had a great crowd, and that’s how you want to go out.”
Brooks said she’d rank this game up 
there as the most memorable of her career, ahead of home wins over Tennessee earlier 
this season and LSU her freshman year.
“It’s our last game here,” Brooks said. 
“We’re seniors and we’re getting ready to 
graduate, so of course you’re going to al-ways remember your senior night.”Seniors sent off with win
ed 600 athletes at 53 schools and 
found just one steroid user, and that low yield was enough to con-vince legislators that steroid use isn’t a problem in Florida high schools — at least not a problem worth fixing.
I couldn’t disagree more. If any-
thing, the program should have been expanded.
Just because the small-scale test only turned up one result doesn’t mean there isn’t a problem with performance-enhancing drugs in high schools. And the simple fact that a test existed was a deterrent for some athletes.
Take O’Brian Abner, a student 
at Orange Park High and one of the football players tested. Abner told The Associated Press last week, “(The test) probably stopped some kids from taking (steroids) because they felt like they might get caught sooner or later. I think it was really good, and I think it should keep going every year.”
No doubt, in a tough economic 
time, money earmarked for high schools is more likely to flow to education than steroid testing, but what’s really more important: new physics books or making sure stu-dents don’t damage their health?
I vote with the latter.And they couldn’t cough up 
$100,000? I know it takes a lot of trimming to reduce a budget, but this is a necessary program.Only three states are left testing 
for steroids — Illinois, Texas and New Jersey — and with its plethora of talented athletes, Florida should be on that list. Universities even have an incentive to get involved.
A large number of these athletes 
will end up playing in college, so the state’s major college athletic departments should chip in and fund testing to help keep their fu-ture players clean.
And even if the state can’t find 
the money and my athletic depart-ments suggestion doesn’t make sense, I can think of another way to secure the funding.
New York Yankees third base-
man Alex Rodriguez recently ad-mitted to using steroids, and I’m betting it would do a lot for the for-mer Miami Westminster Christian High star’s image if he broke off a chunk of his $275 million contract to fund a steroid-testing program.
I’d at least like to hear A-Rod’s 
excuses if he turns down that of-fer.
mIke , from page 14Hodge breaks school record for most career victories with No. 113
just two runs Sunday. Both pitchers gave up runs in the first in-
ning before shutting down the Cardinals the rest of the game.
“The thing I was most proud of, with both (Panteliodis) 
and Nick, was they settled down, and they gave us a chance to win,” UF coach Kevin O’ Sullivan said. “Often times when you 
have a young pitcher out there, 2 runs turn into 3, and 3 turns 
into 4, and the next thing you know there is a leadoff walk, and things snowball out of control.”
Before they took the mound, the two young pitchers saw 
their teammate show how to dominate a game.Senior ace Patrick Keating surrendered 3 runs while strik-
ing out seven over seven innings in the Gators’ season opener Friday. All three hurlers’ pitch counts were at 75, making their 
performances even more impressive.
While Keating (1-0, 2.57) deserved the game 
ball Friday night, right fielder Riley Cooper stole the show Saturday. Besides going 2 for 4 at the plate, he prevented Louisville’s Phil Wunderlich from tying the game in the fourth.
A wide receiver for the football team, Cooper displayed his 
leaping abilities by robbing Wunderlich of a homer that would have been out of Cooper’s reach if it had been hit any farther.
“It was a pretty good ways (over the fence),” Cooper said. “That was the highest I could jump.”
Mooney’s late-game heroics trumped Cooper’s catch, but 
he might never have gotten the chance if it weren’t for another community college transfer.
UF reliever Jeff Barfield (1-0, 0.00) entered the game in the 
eighth inning with runners on the corners and two outs. After pitching around the Cardinals’ best hitter, Chris Dominguez, to load the bases, Barfield struck out Kyle Cheesebrough to pre-serve the tie.
The efforts of the three new Gators completed the sweep of 
the Cardinals, but throughout the weekend they got contribu-tions from most of the team: Every Gator with at least five at-bats recorded a hit.Keating’s seven-inning outing sets example of dominance for freshmen

UF SPORTS ROUNDUP
By EUGENIO TORRENS
Alligator Writer
UF coach Rhonda Faehn said last 
week that the Alabama meet might 
provide the best gymnastics the 
O’Connell Center saw all year.
The Gators kept their end of the 
deal.
Setting a season-high score for 
the second straight week, No. 6 UF 
(5-2, 3-2 Southeastern Conference) pushed its home record to 4-0 by beating No. 8 Alabama 196.875 to 195.625.
“It means a lot, not only to win 
against a top SEC school, but we fi-nally put good routines together on the competition day,” junior Maran-da Smith said.
But the Gators weren’t mistake-
proof. Senior Corey Hartung scored a surprisingly low 9.35 on vault.
“I was kind of shocked,” Har-
tung said.
Faehn said it was the result of 
coaches working with Hartung, try-ing to get her into the horse faster. As a result, she was too aggressive, and her hand slipped.
Smith, who was the anchor leg on 
vault, didn’t let Hartung’s score faze her. She turned in the second 9.9 of the lineup after Melanie Sinclair also scored a 9.9 in the third spot.
“We’re still not where we should 
be at the end of the season. We’re still getting there,” Faehn said. “But what’s nice to see is that they’re not 
reacting negatively to small mis-
takes. They’re not letting it affect the next performer.”
Alabama (3-4, 2-4 SEC) helped 
UF forget about its mistakes when the Tide’s Ashley Priess scored a 9.35 on uneven bars.
Moving to bars, UF had anoth-
er slight landing problem. Alicia 
Goodwin, who had a solid routine, 
took a step on her landing, resulting in a 9.625.
UF headed to beam with the lead 
and kept it. Whereas beam has been a question mark in past meets, the 
event went without issue Friday.
“We’re sick of falling on beam, so 
we went out there and tried to prove 
it and have a good home meet on beam,” Hartung said.
Sinclair added that having a set 
lineup went a long way toward get-ting the gymnasts comfortable and focused.
From beam, the Gators moved 
to floor exercise. Alabama, the No. 1 beam team in the country before the meet, had beam as its last event.
UF registered consistently good 
scores on floor, and Alabama im-ploded on beam, turning in its low-est score of the season in the event for a difference of a whole point on the last event.
SOFTBALL TAKES FOUR OF FIVE GAMES IN TOURNAMENT: For the 
UF softball team, the difference between a win and a loss might be the difference between facing great pitching and the best pitching.
The No. 2 Gators (12-2) won four 
of their five games at the Cathedral 
City Classic in Palm Springs, Calif., but they fell 1-0 in nine innings to No. 7 Washington on Friday night. 
The Huskies (12-0) were led by 
their ace, junior Danielle Lawrie, who allowed only two hits while striking out 12 batters.
Lawrie, who pitched for the Ca-
nadian national team at the Olym-pics in Beijing, is the second pitcher to shut out the Gators this season, with the first being Baylor freshman Whitney Canion. Canion handed UF its only other loss of the season, a 
1-0 defeat on Feb. 8. In both losses, 
the Gators were simply unable to get anything go-ing at the plate.
L a w r i e 
matched up in the circle with UF’s Stacey Nelson (5-
2), who only allowed 1 run on five 
hits in nine innings but suffered her 
second loss of the season.
“It still stings a little bit. It was 
a tough loss,” Nelson said. “They were a great team, and you can’t take anything away from them, but 
I wish the game could have gone 15 
or 16 innings. I was ready to throw. It’s just that 1 run got in, which was kind of a bummer.”Only center fielder Kim Waleszo-
nia was able to get a hit against Law-rie, as the senior reached twice on bunts.
“(Lawrie) kept us on our toes,” 
second baseman Aja Paculba said. “We were seeing the ball, but we just couldn’t get that one hit.”
The Gators were much more suc-
cessful at the plate throughout the 
rest of the tournament, winning their 
other four games. UF defeated three ranked teams in the tournament, in-cluding No. 3 Arizona State (13-4), which UF beat 8-2 on Thursday.
The defending national cham-
pion Sun Devils struck first, quickly putting a run on the board in the first inning, but the Gators struck 
back with an 8-run fifth inning that 
put the game away.
Led by sophomore Stephanie 
Brombacher (7-0), UF also topped No. 14 Fresno State (6-3) with an 8-0 win on Thursday, beat No. 17 Ne-
vada (7-7) 5-0 on Friday and capped 
off the tournament with a 5-1 victory against UNLV (6-6) on Saturday.
