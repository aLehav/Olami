Four years ago, Aisha Robin-
son woke up with a purple nose. 
She said the doctor told her he’d only ever seen a nose that purple inside one of his textbooks.
Today, the 21-year-old UF 
criminology senior treats her al-lergies with medication to avoid the severe symptoms most UF students can expect because of the warmer weather.
Dr. John Harwick, assistant 
professor in the UF Department of Otolaryngology, said the warmer weather this year caused trees to pollinate sooner: in mid-January.
In fact, Gainesville is expected to have mod-
erate pollen counts today and Wednesday, according to the Weather Chan-nel’s PollenCast.
Harwick said 
pollen tends to stick to the 
ground on rainy days. But on windy days, pollen spreads easi-er. He said pollen counts tend to be highest between 5 a.m. and 10 a.m.
Harwick said tree-allergy sea-
son is ending and grass-allergy season is starting.
Common allergy symptoms 
are sneezing, and itchy, watery eyes and nose.
Solansh Hernandez, 20, said 
her allergy symptoms got worse when it was cold about two weeks ago.
“When it’s hot outside, it’s 
not as bad as when it’s cold and windy,” said the UF psychology and marketing sophomore.
Harwick recommends allergy 
treatments like saline nasal rinses and over-the-counter antihista-mines.
He said people with allergies 
should keep their windows closed and limit their outdoor exposure.
Hernandez said she tries not to 
go outside.
“I don’t consider myself an 
outsider,” she said. “I just can’t go  backpacking or on adventures in the forest.”

Campus parking ofﬁ  cials are experi-
menting with eased restrictions at a lot near 
Southwest Recreation Center.
Students can now park in the lot on the 
west side of Bledsoe Drive an hour earlier than before: at 2:30 p.m. The lot has 149 spaces.“It’s something we have talked about for 
some time: to try and ﬁ  nd a solution where we can have parking options out here,” said Director of Recreational Sports David Bowles.
But it was the students on the board of di-
rectors at RecSports who mentioned the idea again and persuaded UF Director of Trans-portation and Parking Services Scott Fox to change the time.
“I hope this accommodation makes it 
easier for students to access the Southwest Rec Center,” Fox said.The time change took effect last week and 
will continue until the end of Summer B.
Transportation and Parking Services staff 
will then determine whether to continue it during the Fall, but RecSports would contin-ue to fund it through the activity and service fees Student Government allocates.
Student Body president-elect Christina 
Bonarrigo said it will cost $934 to move the parking restriction time an hour earlier through Summer B and $2,046 to perma-nently extend the time for the next year.
Emily Daniels thinks the time change will 
be convenient for students.
“Maybe this will encourage more stu-
dents to utilize Southwest,” said the 21-year-old UF psychology junior. “It really is a lux-ury for us, as students, to have such a nice gym with so much to offer.”UF tests allowing earlier parking near Southwest Rec

In response to his March 
21 driving under the inﬂ  uence 
arrest, Mayor Craig Lowe en-tered into a deferred prosecu-tion agreement with the state attorney’s ofﬁ  ce on Monday afternoon.
The agreement drops Lowe’s 
DUI charges and requires him to participate in a DUI interven-tion program, State Attorney Bill Cervone said in a state-ment.
Lowe can participate in the 
program because he doesn’t have major criminal or trafﬁ  c history.
As part of the agreement, 
Lowe must donate $500 to nonproﬁ  t social services agen-cy CDS Family & Behavioral Health Services, pay a $100 prosecution ﬁ  ne, perform 50 hours of community service, complete DUI school, complete an alcohol/substance abuse evaluation and subsequent treatment, give up his driver’s license for 14 days and plead guilty to reckless driving.
Cervone said this type of 
agreement allows the courts to address the case “without protracted litigation that does nothing but subject all involved to needless expenditures of time and resources.”
The agreement came about 
a week and a half after Lowe crashed his 2005 Honda Civic into a road sign near the inter- State drops Mayor

Next time you’re considering being the responsible 
friend, it might be a better idea to reach for that next 
beer.
A study conducted by Pennsylvania State University 
researchers found those who attended college eventu-ally developed a more responsible relationship with al-cohol compared with those who didn’t.
Maureen Miller, director of GatorWell Health Pro-
motion Services, said she thinks these results show many college students are so focused and driven, alco-hol doesn’t play a large role in their priorities or in their lives.
College, in general, has a reputation for unsupervised 
partying, but Miller said she thinks these types of things really depend more on the type of person someone is.
Kaley Thomas, a 19-year-old UF psychology fresh-
man, said she was surprised by the results because she knows a lot of stu-dents who started drinking after they got to college.
“Most students are finally on their 
own for the first time and go wild with the freedom,” she said.
UF criminology senior Claudia 
Cobreiro, 22, said she realizes how true the results could be.
“I understand how, in this economy, people with less 
education can succumb to alcoholism as a means of es-caping the problems they may face,” she said.College drinking leads to responsibility

Imagine taking a class at UF’s 
Nadine McGuire Theatre and Dance 
Pavilion where there is a slight chance of losing a finger.
Since Fall, SawStop, a new safety 
system, has been used in the scenic design workshop for theater and dance classes such as stagecraft.
SawStop technology detects the 
electrical properties of the objects the blade contacts, according to the system’s website.
Human skin is more conductive 
than wood, and the SawStop sys-tem is able to distinguish the differ-ence in its electrical conductivity. It is programmed to stop the blade within milliseconds if it detects hu-man skin, usually resulting in just a nick on the finger.
Zak Herring, technical director at 
UF’s School of Theatre + Dance, said he’s never had a UF student harm his or herself on the table saw.
Even so, Herring said the Saw-
Stop is an additional safety tool.
However, it isn’t without its 
flaws. The SawStop system will stop the blade when in contact with other materials.
“If you cut a wet board, it’ll do the same thing,” Herring said.
Because of the system’s inability 
to distinguish a damp board from a human finger, certain types of wood can’t be cut when the system is on.
Cecilia Padilla took stagecraft be-
fore the SawStop was installed.
“It was a little scary just to know 
that it’s all based on your actions,” said the 20-year-old theater and English sophomore.
If the blade does touch skin, the 
blade will be destroyed, and a re-placement would cost about $150, Herring said.
“Still,” he said, “it’s a lot cheaper 
than a finger.” Saw keeps hands off chopping block◗ SOME WEBSITES HAVE

Taking the GED test on the 
computer could be a blessing or 
a curse.
Director of public affairs 
for the GED testing service CT Turner said he has received positive feedback about the digital version.
He said adults are favoring 
the computer-based test be-cause it is less stressful.
Brett Gerson said he would 
prefer taking a standardized test on the computer for this ex-act reason.
“The fact that I could start 
and stop the test when I wished reduces the stress of it,” said the 21-year-old UF business ad-ministration junior. “And I just hate filling out scantrons.”
But Turner said he doesn’t 
want people to be deceived.Several websites have been 
charged for using the GED brand to push fake credentials.
Turner said the only way 
people can be sure they are taking the real GED test on a computer is to go to a GED test center.
He said other than the 
fraudulent online tests, the dig-ital GED test has been a success and has cut test time by two and a half hours.
“The statistic I was most ex-
cited about was that about 60 percent of adults who tested on the computer were more likely to retake a failed test,” Turner said.
When the computer-based 
test is fully launched next year, the price will increase from $70 to about $130, Turner said.
Cheryl Etters, the press sec-
retary for the Florida Depart-ment of Education, said the digital GED price might affect adults taking the test.
“The price could be a fac-
tor,” Etters said, “but we won’t know until it happens.”GED test goes

UF’s provost announced Friday that Michael Reid will be serv-
ing as the new dean for the College of Health and Human Perfor-
mance starting in July.
“It is clear that the people in the College of Health and Human 
Performance have some really exciting ideas and interesting initia-tives, both in research and education, and as dean, it’s my job to help make those things happen,” said Reid, a professor and chair-man for the Department of Physiology at the University of Ken-tucky.
Reid underwent two rounds of interviews, and after the four-
month-long process, he received his offer letter last week.
“This is all so very new. I’m still shocked,” he said.He said the college has a lot of room to grow in research and ed-
ucational programs, specifically graduate programs and distance learning. Reid’s research focuses on the mechanisms that contrib-ute to muscle weakness and premature fatigue. He said he hopes to balance his administrative obligations with his research.
“I’m a scientist. I can’t imagine not being involved in research,” 
Reid said.
College of Health and Human Performance professor Kelli 
Brown said she assumed her role as interim dean in September. She will leave UF to become provost at Georgia College.
Reid said he is particularly excited about his first six months 
learning firsthand about the college and its people.
“It’s going to be like Christmastime,” he said.4, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, APRIL 2, 2013

Kevin Conley doesn’t ask wom-
en if they have a condom.
“The trade-off between pleasure 
and the risks — I automatically go 
for not using the condom,” said the 20-year-old sports management ju-nior. “It feels better.”
However, the Bill and Melinda 
Gates Foundation is offering a startup grant of $100,000 to who-ever can create the “next genera-tion condom.”
The foundation lists in its chal-
lenge it is looking for the next con-dom that “significantly preserves or enhances pleasure, in order to improve uptake and regular use.”
“If the technology’s there to 
where I don’t have to risk getting an STD or getting somebody preg-nant, and I could still have that same level of pleasure – that would be amazing,” Conley said.A company called Origami and 
the University of Washington ac-cepted the foundation’s challenge. They have made advancements to-ward a new condom. Rather than a latex condom, Origami has a silicon male, female and anal con-dom. Each of these condoms is lu-bricated on the inside.
“[A new condom] can only 
mean good things for the health promotion field because it gives people more options,” said Sa-mantha Evans, health educator at GatorWell Health Promotion Ser-vices.
The University of Washington’s 
discovery is more of a contracep-tive and guard against HIV for women. Two first-year graduate students created a gooey solution that can be inserted into a syringe. 
Victoria Joyal, vice president of 
VOX: Voices for Planned Parent-hood at UF, said the next genera-tion of condoms and sex education need to be intertwined.
“This can only be effective if it 
is presented alongside quality sex education to show potential users why they need protection during sex and that it should be used for all sex acts,” said the 22-year-old computer engineering senior.
Conley said not using a condom 
worries him, but “the pleasure out-weighs the risk every single time.”

Mayoral runoff April 16
section of Northeast 156th Avenue 
and Northeast 21st Street in north-eastern Alachua County.
The Florida Highway Patrol ar-
rested Lowe on DUI and property damage charges after he “performed poorly” on a field sobriety test after the crash. The Florida Highway Pa-trol reported Lowe’s blood alcohol levels to be .069 and .061 about four hours after the crash.
On Thursday, Lowe entered a 
formal written plea of not guilty.
Cervone said the state attorney’s 
office took Lowe’s blood alcohol content levels and his field sobriety test, both of which he said didn’t prove Lowe was too intoxicated to drive, into consideration when mak-ing the agreement.
“As in any court case, civil or 
criminal, both sides are usually well served by an agreed upon resolution that avoids a court fight,” Cervone said. “As to background issues, the Mayor has been treated exactly as anyone else would be in determin-ing his qualifications for this pro-
gram and any 
suggestion to the contrary is un-founded.”
Lowe, who is 
running for re-election against Ed Braddy in the April 16 mayoral runoff, issued a 
statement accepting responsibility and apologizing to residents.
“While my actions have disap-
pointed many, the issues facing our city are greater than me as one person or this particular incident,” he wrote. “In order for our city to continue to progress, we must come together to secure our future.”

Gainesville mayoral candidates Ed Braddy and 
Mayor Craig Lowe discussed their driving under 
the influence arrests during a forum at the Alachua County Health Department on Monday night.
The debate kicked off with a question about 
whether voters should take Braddy and Lowe’s DUI arrests into consideration.
Lowe was arrested March 21, and Braddy plead-
ed no contest to a 2006 DUI charge during his term as District 2 city commissioner.
Both candidates said voters should choose if 
their past arrests will affect their votes.
“All I can offer is how I responded since that 
situation,” Braddy said.
Lowe also responded with an apology.The candidates also discussed transportation, 
economic development and the biomass plant at the event, which was the first of three forums lead-ing up to the April 16 mayoral runoff election. The African American Accountability Alliance hosted Monday’s forum, and about 60 people attended.
Lowe said he believes there needs to be a bal-
anced approach to the introduction of bus rapid transit to the city and shortened wait times on Re-gional Transit System bus routes.
Braddy agreed but doesn’t support bringing 
bus rapid transit, adding he wants to improve RTS routes in east Gainesville.
On economic development, Braddy said the key 
is to remove barriers that prevent small business from starting up across the city. Lowe said econom-ic development should come in the form of targeted tax incentives for businesses.
Regarding the city’s biomass contract, both can-
didates were split in the city’s recent decision to bring the plant to the area.
Lowe, who supports bringing the plant, said it 
will diversify the city’s fuel source, adding that the City Commission and Gainesville Regional Utilities are working to reduce a utility rate increase to resi-dents.
Braddy said he opposed the plant going online 
and is concerned about future utility prices.
“The threat to our affordability is in the con-
tract,” he said. “That is the issue.”

at the Alachua County Administrative building, lo-cated at 12 SE First St.Mayor candidates discuss DUIs at forum

Critically acclaimed children’s 
author and illustrator Peter Sís will 
speak at UF today. His presentation is the main event of UF’s first year participating in International Chil-dren’s Book Day.
“He’s an exceptionally talented, 
brilliant illustrator and children’s book creator,” said John Cech, direc-tor of the Center for Children’s Lit-erature and Culture.
Traditionally held on Hans Chris-
tian Andersen’s birthday, Interna-tional Children’s Book Day is a cel-ebration of children’s literature and storytelling, transcending the bounds of geography, language and culture.
Sís will speak at 7 p.m. at the P.K. 
Yonge Performing Arts Center about his work and the powerful force of books as communication tools across cultures.
Cech said children’s books are an 
important means of breaking down global barriers. Although they may be filled with bright illustrations and follow simple plots, these stories ad-dress universal themes.
“Children’s books can be dark,” he 
said. “They can be complex. They can be ambiguous. They can deal with all sorts of issues.”
Ruth Lowery, an associate profes-
sor in the UF College of Education, is concerned with helping her students get a global perspective on literature.
“The focus for me is that we all 
acknowledge the presence of books in our lives and that stories are from everywhere,” she said.
Along with Sís, storyteller, educa-
tor and writer Barry Stewart Mann will be speaking at multiple venues, including Santa Fe College and the Alachua County Library. At 2 p.m., he will be at Smathers Library to give a presentation on storytelling.Children’s Book Day at UFLIFESTYLE

When anti-smoking TV ads from the Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Prevention ap-
pear while Gabby Gostigian is baby-sitting, she changes the channel.
Gostigian, a 19-year-old UF zoology fresh-
man, said the ads can sometimes be a bit too graphic for children.
The CDC recently released new ads, funded 
by the Affordable Care Act’s Prevention and Public Health Fund, that focus on the stories of people affected by smoking. The ads are ex-pected to run for at least 12 weeks and will be on the TV, radio and billboards, according to the CDC.
The new ads feature Terrie, a former smoker 
who uses an artificial voice box. She tells cur-rent smokers to record their voices so their loved ones can know what they sounded like before smoking impacts their voice. Before, the ads showed Terrie preparing herself for the day by putting in her dentures, covering the hole in her throat with a scarf and wearing a wig.
Although the ads are a continuation of the CDC’s prior anti-smoking campaign, local residents are questioning the ads’ presentation of smoking’s impact on people to send a mes-sage.
Andrew Romero, Alachua County tobacco 
prevention specialist, said ads like Terrie’s are effective but can sometimes generate contro-versy.
“These ads also seem to be incredibly effec-
tive in encouraging and moving smokers closer to wanting to quit,” he said.
Maureen Miller, director of GatorWell 
Health Promotion Services, said the ads might not work well with the younger population be-cause they believe it’ll never happen to them.
“It doesn’t really resonate in terms of chang-
ing their behaviors, especially when we’re talk-ing about tobacco,” she said.
Simon Persico, a 22-year-old UF business 
junior, started smoking when he was 17 years old. He said most smokers don’t see them-selves quitting until they’re older, adding that the ads are scary because they reveal the worst-case scenarios of smoking.
“The ads are obviously a good idea,” he 
said, “but I think they’re a little sensational.”Gainesville residents react to

On friendzones and Adam Sandler
I’ve been hearing a lot of discussion about nice guys 
and friendzones lately. It’s not like either are new con-cepts: the guy who can’t get a girl even though he is 
“such a nice guy” and the guy who has feelings for his friend, but she doesn’t feel the same way toward him. This can go the other way, of course, with nice girls being friend zoned, but you deﬁ  nitely won’t see it as often on the Internet.
Just ask the meme Friend Zone Fiona, who will tell 
you she loves you but isn’t “in love” with you.
I’m glad both ideas are trending out in the open nowa-
days because now it’s fair game for discussion. Although the memes are hilarious, it’s important to not let anyone wallow in self-pity because that’s where something that’s sympathetic and funny gets ugly and resentful.  
Both men and women came forward to argue that just 
because you are nice to a girl doesn’t make her obligated to like you back. Sitting in your current situation and whining about only being a friend isn’t doing either of you any good. Either make a move to ask her out, or ac-cept the situation for what it is and move on.
Of course, that’s always easier said than done, so I’m 
not expecting to see a decline in friend zone complaints for a while.
But it got me thinking why most friendzone and nice-
guy complaints are from men. Well, probably for numer-ous reasons, including that it’s considered more normal for the guy to have to summon his courage to ask the girl on a date, not the other way around, and that forum sites like Reddit and 4chan have mostly males users, so both of these things already skew the grievances to come from one direction.
I also had another idea.I ﬁ  gure that if people have already hypothesized 
about women’s dating preferences enough to create lad-der theory and apply game theory, then I’m entitled to a theory. I call mine “Adam Sandler Syndrome.”
In early Adam Sandler movies like “Billy Madison,” 
“Happy Gilmore” and “The Waterboy,” you can expect that although Sandler’s character is not particularly hand-some, charming, quick-witted and even borders on mild men-tal retardation, he will always end up with the attractive fe-male love interest by the end.
Why? Because the audience 
knows that although Sandler’s character may not have much mental prowess, he has a good heart, and he ultimately de-
serves the girl as the storyline underdog.
No new information here. It’s the same for a lot of 
cheap-thrill comedies.
There isn’t really a movie equivalent for women. I ac-
tually sat here for a while trying to think of an equivalent situation, and what I thought of was a situation where the character Fat Amy from “Pitch Perfect” got Channing Tatum by the end of a movie.
Haven’t seen it yet.Or at least if it exists, the critics would consider it 
wildly avant-garde and groundbreaking.
So maybe Average-Joe-always-scores-the-hottie sets 
up a false expectation for men to believe that, barring all other factors, they deserve to get a woman because they are nice guys with good hearts. And not just any woman, but speciﬁ  cally the woman they choose to pursue.
Of course, in Adam Sandler movies, he somehow ends 
up being the least scummy guy in the plot, so he wins the nice-guy award by default.
In reality, there are so many nice guys that it’s impos-
sible everyone gets what they want.
When women and men complain about being friend 
zoned even though they are such nice people, tell them that’s life and to keep moving forward. 
Or tell them to be born again as Channing Tatum in 
their next lives, because I bet he never has any of these problems.
Lauren Flannery is a business administration sophomore 
at UF. Her column runs on Tuesdays.North Korea: 
Wethinks you doth 
protest too much 
Remember that kid in your elementary school classes or that kid on your bus, or hell, just That Kid? The one who got in trouble so much it didn’t matter how he acted out 
next, no one would pay attention to him? The one who, when he acted out the next time, someone got seriously injured?
Is that kid North Korea? Because it might be. Like, we hate taking anything North Korea has to say seri-
ously at all. Part of that is, of course, because somehow Dennis Rodman is good friends with Kim Jong Un. No, thank you.
Lately, though, it seems like the threat of some kind of attack 
or war from them is becoming more and more real.
Not real in the sense that we should build underground bun-
kers and hide from bombs by hiding under our desks because those help very little. But real in the sense that we ignored that country for so long because it seemed so outrageous to believe anything it had to say.
“I consider the current North Korean threats very serious,” 
said South Korean President Park Geun-hye to the South’s gen-erals, according to a New York Times article. “If the North at-tempts any provocation against our people and country, you must respond strongly at the ﬁ  rst contact with them without any political consideration.
“As top commander of the military, I trust your judgment in 
the face of North Korea’s unexpected surprise provocation,” she continued.
If South Korea is starting to take North Korea’s threats more 
seriously, then the rest of the world should follow suit. Because if anybody should be fed up with the North’s attitude by now, it’s the South.
“White House press secretary Jay Carney said Mondays [sic] 
the U.S. has not detected any military mobilization or reposition-ing of forces from Pyongyang to back up the threats from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un,” a CBS News article read.
“Carney called the U.S. response ‘prudent,’” continued the 
article. “He noted that such tough talk from North Korea is part of a familiar pattern. Carney says the White House takes the threats ‘very seriously.’ But he says the rhetoric ‘is consistent with past behavior.’”
Two F-22 ﬁ  ghter jets, which are said to be the world’s most 
advanced warplanes, arrived in South Korea and are considered a display of America’s commitment to confronting North Ko-rea.
“The bombers’ mission came after threats from North Ko-
rea to attack U.S. soil with missiles, a capability the North likely does not yet possess,” reported USA Today.
While the North is likely blowing hot smoke up everyone’s 
collective global buttholes, we don’t want them to get to the point where they actually act on a nuclear threat.
A Pentagon spokesman told CBS News on Monday morning 
that the F-22’s presence over the peninsula was not a “recent ad-dition to the exercise,” but Pyongyang classiﬁ  ed the “joint South Korean-U.S. war games a preparation for invasion,” wrote CBS News.
Take the news with a grain of salt. It’s likely not true, but the 
global political climate could be shifting.

opinions@alligator.org TUESDAY, APRIL 2, 2013  ALLIGATOR, 7
Growing up, I never thought much about my own 
family traditions. As a family, we ate dinner at the table, watched movies and went to church every 
Sunday. I went to church school and went through all the rituals, but nothing I felt was out of the norm.
That was until my sophomore year of high school, 
when I decided I needed to go on birth control.
My father is Catholic and, for obvious reasons, wants 
to pass on his faith to his children. He’s always reading some sort of a book about Christianity aside from his oth-er fantasy novels, and he goes to church every Sunday.
My dad, through his upbringing and somewhat paying 
attention to the pope, believes almost everything that is said as his own. He feels as though it’s his duty to go to church, bring his children to church and follow all steps to face judgment at the end. None of these traits seem to be bad. Following the church can give someone a sense of being.
It’s not until he strictly follows the beliefs of the Cath-
olic faith when sometimes you can get taken aback. His views on birth control and women made me rethink sub-mitting myself to the same beliefs.How could I be going along 
blindly through the Catholic faith without thinking about how they view women as sub-servient?    
At ﬁ  rst, I went to church be-
cause I was little and didn’t want to get in trouble. Later, I went to church because I felt guilty and like a bad person if I didn’t. Recently, I go to church for my dad.
Does this make me subservient? Every now and then I 
feel like going to the adoration to get total peace of mind. My father must have planted this need to go to church in my head somewhere.
Yet, the fact that I have to hide that I take birth control 
or not discuss certain views with my dad just feels a bit strange.
I started to pay more attention to what was being said 
at church, listening to the readings and then noticing that after one of our priests passed away, the church had a very difﬁ  cult time ﬁ  nding another priest.
One mass had to be shortened because there was only a 
pastor there, so the Eucharist could not be blessed. I then looked to all my church schooling and realized women taught all the classes and led the ofﬁ  ces. There were very few boys in the school as well. You’d just see them if there was an event where there were heavy things to move or if there was a barbecue. Why? Perhaps it’s because the ideal of masculinity speaks of being the strongest or the one to support the family.
Being a “servant to Christ” would not sound appealing 
to these manly-men. 
Women, on the other hand, are taught from an early 
age that they are servants to Christ as well as servants to their husbands.
But if being a servant to Christ in the present means to 
follow the church law, it’s a bit unsettling that these deci-sions are made up from an entirely male clergy with no option of ever hearing a woman’s voice unless speaking about the saints or of Mary.
Although my father does go to church, he holds his 
opinions true to the ways in which women’s inequality is perfectly sound under the name of God.

Speaking Out
As Florida’s attorney general, 
I work to protect Floridians.  One of the most alarming and 
dangerous trends I’ve seen since tak-ing ofﬁ  ce is the rise of synthetic drug abuse.  
Some of you may generally know 
synthetic drugs as incense, potpourri, 
K2, spice and bath salts. These cathino-nes — bath salts — and cannabinoids — spice — are sold under names such as “Red Eye,” “Purple Flake,” “Scooby Snax,” “1/2 Baked Hulk” and “Express Barely Legal.” Although these drugs are marketed in bright packages and given innocuous names, the fact is they can be deadly. They can cause psychotic episodes, hallucinations, seizures, para-noia, tremors and more.
These drug manufacturers are tar-
geting young people. The Drug Abuse 
Warning Network issued a ﬁ  rst-of-its-kind report last year that studied emergency room visits linked to syn-thetic drug abuse. 
 It found that more than 11,000 
emergency room visits nationwide in-volved a synthetic cannabinoid prod-uct in 2010. Seventy-ﬁ  ve percent of those visits were from people ranging in age from 12 to 29.
One February 2013 CNN article en-
titled “Teen narrowly escapes death after smoking synthetic marijuana” captures just how dangerous and life-altering these drugs can be.  
After smoking potpourri, a 16-year-
old girl ended up in the intensive care unit for weeks. An MRI revealed that she had suffered several strokes.  
She nearly died and emerged from 
the hospital blind and with brain dam-age, requiring physical, occupational and speech therapy.
This girl’s story underscores just 
how dangerous these drugs are and why we need to work together to stop synthetic drug abuse.  There are three things you, as college students, can do to help.  
First, if you see these drugs on any 
store shelf in Florida, call local law enforcement. Second, tell your friends how dangerous these drugs are and discourage them from using them.  Fi-nally, if you see someone who appears to be suffering from the effects of syn-thetic drug abuse or is in any type of medical distress, call 911 for emergen-
cy medical assistance.  
By fol-
lowing these three steps, 
you can save lives.
In closing, I promise you I will re-
main vigilant in my efforts to rid Flori-da of synthetic drugs.  During the 2011 and 2012 legislative sessions, I worked with the Florida Legislature to add dangerous synthetic compounds to the Schedule I of controlled substances.
This legislative session, I am work-
ing with bill sponsors, Sen. Rob Brad-ley and Rep. Clay Ingram, and the Florida Legislature to add an addi-tional 27 synthetic substances to the Schedule I of controlled substances, making it a third-degree felony for an individual to “sell, manufacture, or deliver, or possess with intent to sell, manufacture or deliver” these danger-ous drugs.
We will continue to do whatever it 
takes to protect Floridians from syn-thetic drugs, and I ask that you join me in these efforts to make Florida a safer place.

Speaking OutDear Mr. O’Reilly,
I want to start by congratulat-
ing Fox News for being the No.1 
network in cable news for 11 consecutive 
years. First Amendment-loving liberals hate when you say that, which is why I like to repeat it.
I would also like to commend you 
(and Martin Dugard) for your best-selling books, “Killing Lincoln” and “Killing Ken-nedy.” I had the opportunity to read both of them, and they were excellent.
But, let’s cut to the chase. During the 
Kelly File segment (last week) with Meg-yn Kelly, you contended the compelling argument is on the side of homosexuals. To you, their argument is “compelling” because they are Americans, so they have the “right” to be treated like everybody else does. Further, you argue the other side needs to have a strong argument. But in your mind, they don’t. All they know how to do is “thump the Bible.”
Really? As a fellow Christian, I ﬁ  nd it 
rather degrading that you would marginal-ize a portion of your audience by referring to them, as well as the secular opponents of marriage equality, as Bible thumpers. Yet you question Christian leaders who won’t stand up for Easter?
No wonder they won’t. In your “Talking Points Memo” on 
March 25, you shared the story of Ryan Rotela, the Florida Atlantic University student who was asked by his liberal pro-fessor to stomp on the word “Jesus.” In response, you said, “There is no question that many college campuses are becoming radicalized.”
Are you surprised? It’s because of individuals like you, 
who give Christians a bad rap. In Luke 10:27, Jesus tells us to love the Lord our God with all our heart, soul, strength and mind, and to love our neighbor as ourself. In Matthew 7:1, we are told not to judge, or we, too, will be judged. We are instructed to love everybody, including homosexu-als.However, many 
people also believe marriage is the sacred union be-tween a man and a woman. So, they interpret their re-ligious texts liter-ally — is that OK?
Furthermore, you agreed “100 percent” 
with Megyn Kelly when she said she didn’t hear anything articulated that was particu-larly persuasive. Have you considered the arguments that are being put forth by the opponents of marriage equality? Do you realize what it could mean for America if we decide to federally legitimize the union between two men or two women? Do you understand that if it passes, we’re talking about fundamentally redeﬁ  ning not just marriage, but also our rights as citizens?
How does marriage equality hurt tradi-
tional marriage? 
I’ll tell you. If we decide homosexuals have the right 
to marry, then we will, eventually, have to extend that “right” to bigamists, polyga-mists, polyamorists and incestists (if that’s what they’re called). Marriage will no lon-ger be deﬁ  ned as the union between one man and one woman — it will be deﬁ  ned as the union among two or more people, related or not, who love each other.
Pardon me for being dogmatic, but 
when a society chooses to embrace cul-tural relativism in the name of “equality,” that society will cease to distinguish right from wrong. It is my understanding that it’s not the government’s responsibility to legislate morality. Rather, it is the govern-ment’s responsibility to uphold the values and rights given to us not by man but by God. If you call yourself a “Culture War-rior,” then act like one. 
I look forward to your reply.

UF students may want to get into 
the habit of wearing bug spray.
A rare human case of Eastern 
equine encephalitis, a mosquito-
borne illness, may make its way to Gainesville after the Florida De-partment of Health discovered a Tampa resident was infected earlier this month.The virus, also known as EEE, 
can be transmitted through a mos-quito bite, which causes inflam-mation of the brain and eventually death.
Jonathan F. Day, UF professor of 
medical entomology, said although the illness is rare, it’s commonly found in North Florida.
Day said there are five main 
mosquito-borne diseases native to Florida. EEE is 
considered to be the second-worst disease behind West Nile Virus.
The virus 
usually appears in June and July. However, Day 
said the disease is appearing earlier than usual, attributing this year’s mild winter to increased mosquito activity.
“It’s a disease we are concerned 
about,” he said.
Day warns of several symptoms 
related to the disease such as a high fever that exceeds 102 degrees, se-vere headaches and blurred vision.
Some UF students said they 
aren’t concerned with the disease spreading.Claire Fassett, 18, a UF food sci-
ence and human nutrition fresh-man, said she wouldn’t start stock-ing up on bug repellent soon unless more cases are reported.
Teresa Christmas, a 20-year-
old UF anthropology sophomore, agreed, saying she doesn’t like the feeling of bug spray.
“[I’d] rather get bit than put on 
that spray,” she said.

In a society where science is the fu-
ture, a UF associate education professor 
published a book about the history and impact of science programs.
Sevan Terzian, an associate profes-
sor in the School of Teaching & Learn-ing, recently published a book entitled “Science Education and Citizenship.”
The book explores the initiative to 
improve science education through his investigation of the history behind it.
“Many of us are familiar with sci-
ence clubs and fairs and talent searches, but most of us don’t really have a sense as to why they got started and why they remain so popular,” Terzian said.
The answers came a lot earlier in his-
tory than Terzian expected. His book discusses history starting with science fairs in the 1920s through the end of the 1950s.
His theory states that by participat-
ing in science programs, students de-velop stronger reasoning skills that are going to allow them to become good citizens.
Grace Ooi credits her passion for sci-
ence to her involvement in extracurricu-lar activities.
“You read about concepts in books, 
and you learn about things in class, but it was only because of the exposure I got [from] hands-on learning through science programs where I discovered what I wanted to do,” said the 20-year-old material sciences and engineering sophomore.
But Terizan emphasizes science edu-
cation is not just for the future scientist.
“A democracy couldn’t work if you 
had people who were not able to think rationally or to think like scientists,” he said.UF teacher’s book looks at

For five games, Lauren Haeger 
was arguably the best softball play-
er in the country.
From March 16-22, she went 7 
for 12 at the plate. Five of those hits left the park, while the remaining two were RBI doubles. She drove in 13 runs and walked seven times during the span.
But since a doubleheader against 
Arkansas on March 22, Haeger has fallen into a deep slump. The soph-omore is 1 for 14 in her last five games, including a 1-for-8 stretch in Florida’s weekend series against Ole Miss.
“I was coming off a really hot 
w e e k e n d , ” Haeger said. “You can’t be on top all the time.”
Haeger drew three walks dur-
ing the weekend and scored a run after hitting a single in Game 3 of the series, but was otherwise un-productive. When she made outs, she was unable to move runners over.
In Game 2 of the series, she came 
up in the first inning with runners on first and third with no outs. With a chance to blow the game open, Haeger was caught looking on strikes. 
In the same game, she had a 
chance to put the Rebels away. With one out and two runners on, she had the opportunity to drive in the eighth run that would have run-ruled Ole Miss. Haeger hit a line drive that was fielded by the third baseman and turned into a 5-3 double play.
“I felt a little off timing,” Haeger 
said.
To help time the ball better and 
shorten up her swing, she showed bunt before the pitch in several of her at-bats.
“I often go to that when my 
swing isn’t quite working the way I want it to,” Haeger said. 
But the Gators offense picked 
up where she left off.

one hit in the series, No. 3 Florida Sophomore

ARLINGTON, Texas — Fol-
lowing the worst shooting per-
formance of his career Sunday, Erik Murphy sat hunched over in his locker, staring at the ground and gripping his towel with both hands. 
The senior forward’s eyes wa-
tered as he answered reporters’ questions with short, subdued responses. 
“It seemed like you guys got 
position inside and couldn’t fin-ish,” one reporter said to Mur-phy. “What were some of the issues?”
“Just us missing shots,” Mur-
phy replied. 
“Have you ever had a game 
like this?” another reporter asked. 
“No,” Murphy said. Sunday was an unceremo-
nious conclusion to Murphy’s collegiate career. During the No. 3 seed Gators’ 79-59 loss to the fourth-seeded Wolverines in Cowboys Stadium, he went scoreless, missing all 11 of his field-goal attempts — including two threes — in 22 minutes of action. 
Murphy grabbed a team-best 
eight rebounds and committed three of Florida’s 15 turnovers. 
“Obviously it’s not what we 
wanted,” Murphy said. “They just wanted it more, and they got it done. We didn’t.”Forward Glenn Robinson III 
and Michigan’s frontcourt bul-lied Murphy throughout the con-test. 
During Florida’s first two of-
fensive possessions, Murphy tried to get good position in the paint but had one of his two at-tempts blocked by Robinson. At the 4:19 mark in the first half, the 6-foot-6 Robinson rejected the 6-foot-10 Murphy’s layup at-tempt off the backboard.
“Obviously, Erik had a very, 
very difficult game,” coach Billy Donovan said.  “We went to him early there, to start the game against Robinson. We felt like there was a size advantage and we could get some stuff there.  And he just never could really get it going.”
Said senior guard Kenny 
Boynton. “It was the game plan coming in. We thought they didn’t have great shot blockers. … So the main focus was to go inside.”
Donovan subbed Murphy out 
of the game with 9:14 remaining. The senior did not return until the 3:14 mark when Michigan led by 22 points. 
Murphy’s Elite Eight perfor-
mance was a sour end to his best season as a Gator. This year, he averaged career-best marks with 12.2 points and 5.5 boards per game. He shot 45.3 percent from behind the arc, ranking second on the team.

The Gators’ path to the Final Four of the 
WNIT has been a whirlwind — four games 
in four cities during a span of 10 days. And it has been equally unconventional. 
Since the WNIT expanded from 32 to 64 
teams in 2010, Syracuse is the only other pro-gram to advance to the semifinals by winning four road games.
The Orange accomplished the feat in 2012 
before falling to James Madison in the WNIT Final Four.
“Four really good wins against really 
good competition, all teams that could have just as easily been in the NCAA Tournament,” coach Amanda Butler said. “I think it speaks a lot about where we have gone — especially in the past month.”
Added senior Jennifer 
George: “You’re in one city 
one night and the next city the next night. It’s been a lot, but it’s been a good experience for all of us.
“Being able to play all of these games on 
the road and being able to win, (we) definite-ly have a lot of confidence going into each game.”After topping Florida International 75-68 
in the first round and Winthrop 85-53 in the second round, Florida was the only team in the tournament to advance to the Sweet 16 after collecting two road victories. 
UF added wins against Charlotte and 
James Madison to reach the semifinals — a four-game winning streak that is Florida’s longest since a six-game unbeaten stretch in December. 
The Gators can capture the first postsea-
son championship in program history with two more victories. Florida plays at Drexel on Wednesday at 7 p.m.

game against either Kansas State or Utah.
“Certainly, we would have loved to 
have had the chance to be in the NCAA 
Tournament and knew we were good enough to be there,” Butler said. “The things that I’m really proud of our team and our staff as well is that (it) had no im-pact on what we had an opportunity to do.
“We have been able to use [the WNIT] 
in a very positive way and now put our-selves in a position to be one of the final four teams in a very, very good field with the opportunity to do something special.”
The journey is surprising given the 
trouble the Gators had with winning con-sistently on the road during the regular season. Florida State handed Florida a 31-point drubbing in Tallahassee on Nov. 15. Butler’s squad also dropped a road contest to Michigan during non-confer-ence play. 
Against Southeastern Conference op-
ponents, the Gators were equally under-whelming on the road. 
UF lost five of its eight league games 
away from the O’Connell Center.
Florida’s only SEC road victories came 
against Auburn, Mississippi State and Alabama. The Tigers, the Bulldogs and the Crimson Tide finished 11th, 12th and 13th, respectively, in the SEC standings this season. 
But the Gators have started erasing 
their road demons with success in the WNIT. 
“The best of them has been revealed 
this postseason, and I think the road chal-lenges have been a big part of that,” Butler said.
“It’s been a great opportunity for us to 
grow, a great opportunity for them to ma-ture in ways that you just aren’t afforded the same opportunities when you have the comforts of home.”

and Vernon Macklin. During his first two 
years at UF, Murphy started once and aver-aged 9.9 minutes per game. 
“He never really wanted to inject himself 
into the team like we needed him to,” Dono-van said. “He was worried about chemistry, stepping on toes more his freshman year.”
But after Murphy completed his sopho-
more season, his future with the Gators was in question.
Murphy and former Gators forward 
Cody Larson were arrested in April 2011 for third-degree felony burglary after allegedly trying to break into a car outside of a bar in St. Augustine.
Donovan suspended Murphy indefinite-
ly, but the forward rejoined the team before the 2011-12 season started. 
He bounced back from the incident with 
a solid junior year, averaging 10.5 points and 4.5 rebounds in 25.9 minutes per game. 
“He saw an opportunity to step into the 
role and felt comfortable with it,” Donovan said. 
“The last two years, I don’t know if there’s 
been many frontcourt players that can stretch the defense the way he can, that’s more (of) a team guy than he is. From his freshman year to where he is now, I’ve seen incredible growth, both on and off the court.”
Murphy will have plenty of time to re-
flect on his four-year legacy at Florida, dur-ing which he played in four NCAA Tour-naments and made three trips to the Elite Eight. 
But after a college career filled with highs 
and lows ended on a bitter note, he was un-able to reflect after Sunday’s game. 
“Yeah, man, I don’t know,” Murphy said. 
“I’ll think about that after this sets in.”TUESDAY, APRIL 2, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 15

to Georgia on Feb. 17 in the O’Connell Center.
Haeger still batting 
third despite struggles
(35-3, 10-2 Southeastern Con-
ference) scored 20 runs. 
After Haeger struck out in 
the first inning of Game 2, se-nior Kelsey Horton bailed her out with a two-out grand slam to put Florida up 5-0 in the first inning.
“It’s always good to know 
that if I struggle, there’s other people behind me who can come up with big hits at big times,” Haeger said.
Coach Tim Walton switched 
up the lineup for the Ole Miss series. Third baseman Stepha-nie Tofft moved up to second in the lineup and center fielder Kirsti Merritt moved to fifth. Haeger stayed in the three-hole.
“I wanted to try to figure 
out how to generate a little bit more offense when either... Lauren’s being pitched around, or... when Lauren’s not swing-ing the bat as well as we’re used to,” Walton said.
Rogers earns award again: For 
the second straight week, the 
SEC honored Hannah Rogers.
The league named Rogers 
the SEC Pitcher of the Week on Monday for the second con-secutive week after she pitched in all four games the Gators played.
The junior right-hander 
pitched 25 innings dating back to Florida’s 7-3 win against Florida State on Wednesday at Katie Seashole Pressly Sta-dium.
In those four games, she sur-
rendered only four earned runs while striking out 21 batters.
“Coming from Wednesday 
and the big win we got, I think the energy just carried over,” Rogers said.

JURNY DUTY
  After a month and a half of sub-par play, 
the Florida baseball team is coming off its best series of the season, taking two 
of three games from Ole Miss last weekend.
  While their 11-15 
start before last week-end is a more telling sample, UF should be optimistic moving forward.
  In its ﬁ  rst two 
weekend series of Southeastern Confer-
ence play against No. 10 Kentucky and No. 2 Vanderbilt, Florida won the Friday opener. Then, the Gators dropped the ﬁ  nal two games of each series thanks to poor pitching perfor-mances on Saturday from Jonathon Crawford and on Sunday from Eric Hanhold.
  Against the Rebels, those issues were non-
existent. Crawford looked like he did in the latter part of 2012, throwing a complete-game shutout against Ole Miss on Saturday. 
  Freshman lefty Danny Young followed 
Crawford with 5.1 shutout innings in the best Sunday start by a Gator this season. In last Tuesday’s loss to FSU in Jacksonville, Young gave up just one run in four innings and struck out ﬁ  ve in relief of Tucker Simpson. 
  Young has earned the Sunday job. Together 
with Crawford and fellow freshman Jay Car-michael, coach Kevin O’Sullivan ﬁ  nally has a weekend rotation that inspires conﬁ  dence.
  The lineup is coming around as well. 
Florida scored four runs off Vanderbilt’s Fri-day starter, Kevin Ziomek, who is second in the league with a .157 batting average against.  Catcher Taylor Gushue, who was homer-less and hitting just .231 before UF’s 9-4 win against UNF on March 19, is hitting .400 in his last eight games with three home runs and has brought his average up to .277,
  The promising weekend also came with 
two pinch-running appearances from fresh-man shortstop Richie Martin. Prior to the Ole Miss series, Martin hadn’t seen the ﬁ  eld since breaking his ﬁ  nger in a 6-3 win against Miami on March 3. Martin was arguably Florida’s best player through the ﬁ  rst 13 games, leading the team with 13 hits and ranking third on the squad with a .342 batting average.  Florida (13-16, 4-5 Southeastern Confer-
ence) hosts UCF (18-11, 4-2 Conference USA) — a team it beat 5-3 on Feb. 19 in Orlando — tonight at 7 at McKethan Stadium. If the Gators beat the Knights again, they’ll head into this weekend’s series at Mississippi State needing only a series win to reach .500.
  Next Tuesday, UF has another date with 
FSU’s Luke Weaver, which isn’t likely to end well, just like the ﬁ  rst two.  But based on its performance against Ole Miss, Florida has a good chance of once again taking two of three — or at least stealing one game — against No. 13 South Carolina next weekend.
  So after the series against the Gamecocks, 
the Gators could realistically be right at .500. From that point on, only three of their ﬁ  nal 19 games are against top-25 teams. Fourteen of Florida’s games to this point and 21 of its ﬁ  rst 37 are against ranked opponents. With a schedule that tough, UF won’t need to ﬁ  n-ish more than a handful of games over .500 to make the NCAA Tournament.
  A trip to Omaha might not be a foregone 
conclusion as it has been in years past for this program. But for a team that lost numerous All-Americans during the offseason, being in the hunt is not such bad thing.
