Students’ tweets have sparked some 
new changes at Library West.
Patrick Reakes, chair of Library West, 
said students complained about unused 
computer monitors on the southwest cor-
ner of the third ﬂ  oor, so they have been 
moved.
George A. Smathers Libraries’ In-
formation Technology Department has replaced the old monitors with 17-inch monitors, power outlets with USB ports and connector plates that allow students to connect their laptops to the monitor screens in 16 booths, said Stacey Ewing, assistant university librarian and infor-mation commons coordinator at Library West.
Ewing said students used the booths 
as group space but used their own laptops instead of the computers on the tables.
“We recently moved the old comput-
ers to the second ﬂ  oor so they would get 
more use,” she said.
Reakes said no additional funding was 
required for the additions.
“The only cost was staff time,” he 
said.

After two days of crowdsourcing ideas 
from students last week, Students Party and 
Swamp Party released platforms for the Fall 2013 elections.
On Monday, Swamp Party released its 
platform ﬁ  rst. Their ideas include decreasing parking restrictions at Southwest Recreation Center, more campus meeting space for stu-dent organizations and a live GPS bus track-ing screen at the Hub.“This is a platform that encopasses all the 
students needs, whether it’s engagement or transparency,” said party spokesman Joseph Michaels.
Students Party announced its platform 
Monday night. The party categorized its ideas: better services for students, sustain-
ability for a 21st century university, transpor-
tation reform, better dining options, improv-ing academic life, treating graduate students fairly, protecting our campus, ﬁ  scal responsi-bility and fundamental Student Government reform.
“Our platform is more than just some-
thing we put on our ﬂ  ier,” said party cam-paign manager Helie Dharia.SG parties reveal platformsCHRIS ALCANTARA

The call came in the middle 
of the night, jolting Carlos Agu-ilar awake as he slept in a Beaty Towers dorm room.
It was 3 a.m. on Oct. 13, and 
after spending nearly a month in Gainesville looking for his missing 18-year-old son, it had become routine for Carlos to keep his cellphone on in case police tried to call.
He picked up, and a report-
er’s voice greeted him.
A body had been found, 
she said, in the woods in Levy County.
It was the ﬁ  rst time Carlos 
heard of the body’s discovery, but it was a moment he had been preparing for since he made the 340-mile trip from South Florida on Sept. 21.
He contacted Gainesville 
Police to conﬁ  rm what the re-porter told him.
Did they really ﬁ  nd a body?Yes, the ofﬁ  cer said, but in-
vestigators could not conﬁ  rm an identity yet. They did, how-ever, believe it was his son. The clothing — a striped long-sleeve shirt, dark pants and navy Vans — matched the outﬁ  t he was last seen wearing.
Pacing, Carlos asked if he 
should stop the search.
Yes.“At that moment,” Car-
los, 45, said, “I knew they had found Christian.”

When UF alumnus Eric Tilden 
decided working as an engineer 
wasn’t fulﬁ  lling him, he decided to launch an initiative to help local nonproﬁ  ts through media.
“I love my job, but the day-
to-day business side didn’t really completely ﬁ  t me,” he said.
His friends kept pushing him 
to take action, he said, so he did.
On Monday, 27-year-old Til-
den will kick off www.karmasa-pien.com, a website he founded that will raise money to help one 
local nonproﬁ  t per week.
For the entire week, T-shirts and other merchandise featur-
ing the organization will be sold on the website. At the end of the week, the proceeds will be donat-ed to the nonproﬁ  t.
The merchandise will be styl-
ized with original graphic designs by Parisleaf Printing and Design that represent the values of the featured organization.
Chad Paris, Parisleaf’s owner, 
said the initiative has a good busi-ness model and energetic leader-ship.
The ﬁ  rst featured nonproﬁ  t 
will be Gentle Carousel Minia-ture Therapy Horses, an organi-zation that travels with a team of tiny horses to comfort distressed people.
“People here want to see others 
to make it and achieve their goals, and KarmaSapien helps people do 
that,” Tilden said.UF grad to promote

Kyla Berrier was in middle school when her family 
ﬁ  rst began to notice her grandmother didn’t have the 
memory she used to.
“It’s not just the person who has Alzheimer’s that 
is affected, but the entire family,” said the 22-year-old 
ﬁ  rst-year doctor of nursing practice student.
Now, with a recent $7.7 million grant awarded 
over the next ﬁ  ve years to UF through the National 
Institutes of Health for Alzheimer’s research, Berrier said she thinks any progress is beneﬁ  cial.
This money will allow researchers to expand upon 
ongoing research to ﬁ  nd therapies to treat Alzheim-er’s disease.
“It gives us more ﬂ  exibility and more opportuni-
ties to perform larger scale experiments,” said Yona Levites, assistant professor in the Department of Neu-roscience at the Center for Translational Research in Neurodegenerative Medicine at UF.
There currently are no treatments that can cure or 
reverse Alzheimer’s, Levites said.
Researchers reason that previous drugs were test-
ed too late in the disease’s progression, and the pa-tients were beyond the point of return, she said.
Paramita Chakrabarty, a UF neuroscience assistant 
professor, said the available treatments could extend life by six months.
For this project, the UF researchers will be collabo-
rating with the Mayo Clinic Florida and the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle, using data collected from both humans and mouse models, according to a news release.
The research will focus on the role the immune 
system plays into the disease’s development, and re-searchers hope to use the brain’s innate immune sys-tem to modify the pathology of Alzheimer’s disease, 
Chakrabarty said.
They are working with versions 
of a few immune genes, which are 
used in therapies for peripheral im-mune diseases such as arthritis.
A few pathological identiﬁ  ers 
commonly found in patients after 
death are amyloid plaques, located outside of brain cells, and intrac-
ellular tau tangles, Chakrabarty 
said.
Normally, the amyloid peptide is broken down, 
but researchers don’t know why it sometimes begins to accumulate in the brain, Levites said. Researchers believe the presence of both the amyloid plaques and tau tangles eventually lead to cell death, which causes the noticeable symptoms, Chakrabarty said. 
She said a goal is to ﬁ  nd a way to cause the blocks 
to form at a slower rate or not at all, which might not treat the disease, but it would lengthen the time a per-son has in a nondemented state.
“We can test proposed genes of interest that came 
out of the large studies,” Levites said, “and test one-by-one the effect in the models.”UF gets grant to research Alzheimer’s

Next month marks a year since Carlos 
hung up the phone in that room and cried as 
he shared the news with his family.
UF freshman Christian Aguilar went miss-
ing in September 2012, starting a disappear-
ance-turned-murder case that gripped the 
Gainesville community and still hasn’t ended.
His death, as well as the arrest of Pedro 
Bravo, the 19-year-old former Santa Fe Col-lege student accused of killing him, brought national attention to the city.
Volunteers and officers statewide came to 
help the Aguilars and local police search miles of woods, swamps and fields.
Now, a year later, two families are without 
their sons.
One is dead, the other in jail.
Brothers
Christian was born Nov. 16, 1993, the old-
est of two boys.
Growing up in Doral, outside Miami, Chris-
tian was close to his younger brother, Alex.
He and Alex, 17, often played soccer and 
watched TV together. If Alex encountered a problem, Christian was the first person he’d call.
Now, Alex takes comfort in learning more 
about his brother from old friends and Chris-tian’s 19-year-old girlfriend, Erika Friman.
He clings to details of his older brother — 
like how Christian would stop on the street to pet kittens — to remember him.
“Random things like that and any little fun 
fact about Chris always are so important to me,” he  said, “because those little actions and details add to the Chris that I knew.”
Since his brother’s funeral, Alex said, the 
family has tried to return to normalcy.
But it’s been a struggle because many of 
the questions surrounding Christian’s death are still unanswered.
“Even with all the information we know 
now, you never know exactly what hap-pened,” Alex said. “And that curiosity of 
wanting to know ... always exists.”
Vanished
Christian set his sights on UF when he 
was a junior at Doral Academy Preparatory 
School, where he took college-level classes in the Scholars Program. Bravo and Friman, who dated for more than two years, were also in 
the program.
Shortly before graduating summa cum 
laude in 2012, Christian got his wish: He’d be 
a Gator starting Summer B.
He wanted a biomedical engineering de-
gree. 
He wanted to go to medical school. He wanted to be a cardiologist.In Gainesville, Christian spent time with 
Friman, who he’d started dating after their graduation. They ate at restaurants like Chick-fil-A and attended GatorNights at the Reitz Union.
On Sept. 19, the night before Christian 
went missing, he was at Friman’s apartment. 
She asked him to stay the night. 
He couldn’t. He had to wake up early.
They kissed goodbye.Friman watched Christian walk to the bus 
stop, where he boarded a bus back to campus.
That was the last time she saw him alive.The next evening, she texted Christian. He 
had plans to meet Bravo, who wanted his ad-vice on something.
“He didn’t really want to go and meet with 
Pedro,” Friman said. However, “he felt bad not helping him.”
Later, after hours of leaving voice mails 
and text messages, Friman called several of their mutual friends. 
None had seen or heard from him.She started to worry but tried reasoning 
herself out of it.
Maybe Christian was at the library. Maybe he was at home sleeping. Maybe he just didn’t have signal.
“I always had a gut feel-
ing from early on when he wasn’t answering, but it was kind of like, ‘Let me think of this rationally. I’m 
sure he’s fine ... I’m sure it 
was a reasonable explana-tion,’” she said.
She fell asleep but not for long. Friman 
woke up in the middle of the night and tried Christian’s phone again. Still nothing. She called Bravo several times. No answer.
Finally, Bravo picked up. He said he and 
Christian had an argument earlier, ending 
in Christian getting out of the car in north 
Gainesville.
Frustrated, Friman got off the phone with 
Bravo and called her sister. Eventually, she went to sleep.
She woke up early on Sept. 21 and called 
Christian’s roommate. She asked if Christian returned to their dorm.
He hadn’t.
“That’s when I started panicking.”
Warning signs
Meanwhile, more than 300 miles south in 
Kendall, Carlos arrived at his KW Property 
Management & Consulting office.
Then, he got a call from his wife, Claudia.She asked if he’d talked to Christian recent-
ly. No, he said, not since earlier in the week.
Claudia told him Friman hadn’t been able 
to reach Christian the night before.
“Immediately, as a father, I knew some-
thing was wrong,” he said.
Carlos closed his office and headed to Doral 
Academy, where Alex, too, had received a call from Friman. Alex hadn’t answered, but he thought it was weird she would call him.
Shortly after noon, an-
other unusual occurrence: 
Carlos pulled Alex out of 
his Advanced Placement 
English Language and Composition class.
“My dad would never 
take me out of school with-
out letting me know,” Alex said.
Something happened to Christian, Carlos 
explained, as the two drove to pick up Clau-
dia.
They didn’t stop at their house to pack.
Instead, they drove to a gas station and left 
for Gainesville just after 12:30 p.m.
For most of the drive, the family was si-
lent.
“It was one of the longest car rides I’ve ever 
had,” Alex said, “even though we made a five-hour trip in around three hours.”
Carlos’ mind raced: Where would he get 
the money to afford search dogs? How was he going to ask other people for help? Would he find his son alive?
At about 3:30 p.m., the family arrived at 
UPD headquarters, near Beaty.
Friman and her older sister came out of the 
station and told the Aguilars that officers took Bravo in for questioning.
He told police he fought with Christian the 
day before and left him on the 5000 block of Northwest 13th Street.
The family later learned Bravo would be 
detained under Florida’s Baker Act because he told officers he would hurt himself.
“We were very realistic about the situa-
tion,” Alex said. “We understood what could have happened. And even though we didn’t 
want to accept it, we understood the possibil-
ity of him murdering Chris.”The family, along with Friman and sever-
al others, went to Northwest 13th Street and started the search for Christian. Later, they returned to campus, where University Police 
offered the family a Beaty room to sleep in.
The family was out searching before dawn 
the next day.
The search
The family looked along Northwest 13th 
Street, and with police, combed the Interstate 
75 corridor between Newberry Road and Southwest Williston Road. They’d check an area around Southwest 34th Street and Hull 
Road. They’d search the woods around South-
west 62nd Boulevard, Alley Katz Corner bowl-ing alley, Windmeadows Mobile Home Park.
The search also reached UF, where volun-
teers posted and distributed fliers with Chris-tian’s face on them.
GPD helicopters circled above the city 
while police dogs sniffed for Christian.
Most of the Aguilar family drove up from 
South Florida to help, cutting through trees with machetes and poking the ground with branches.  
Almost all of Gainesville Police’s officers 
were involved in the search, GPD spokesman Officer Ben Tobias said. They worked with UPD officers and Alachua County Sheriff’s Office deputies.
“Once we realized that we had good, solid 
evidence that something happened to Chris-tian, and we couldn’t find him, it was literally call everybody out,” he said. “There are no off days. There’s no vacation. Everybody’s look-ing for this kid.”
During the investigation, 18 agencies do-
nated resources, which included police dogs from the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office and Sweetwater Police Department.
Tobias said the FBI and U.S. Marshals were 
involved.
More than 400 volunteers, including resi-
dents from Alachua and Miami-Dade coun-ties, helped. 
UF and SFC students also joined in.Samuel Schaller, a 20-year-old SFC emer-
gency medical services sophomore from Sara-sota, decided to participate after he saw a post-
ing on Gainesville Police’s Facebook page.
“I just saw they were looking for volun-
teers, and I knew I would be somewhat decent 
at that,” he said.
Twelve local businesses, including Jimmy 
John’s, donated food, water and supplies.
Doral Academy Principal Douglas Rodri-
guez allowed his students and teachers — many of whom knew Christian and Bravo — 
to drive up to Gainesville. The school collected 
$40,000 in donations for the family.
“In my 27 years being principal, I’ve never 
seen a reaction from a community and group of students like I saw for Christian,” he said.
Working alongside the Aguilars was Pat-
rick Sessions, of Coconut Grove, who assists families through the National Center for Miss-ing and Exploited Children.  
Sessions, 66, said the search reminded him 
of when his 20-year-old daughter, Tiffany, dis-appeared 24 years ago on a walk through UF’s campus.
“This case was a lot closer to home for me 
because it was Gainesville,” he said. “I thought to myself, ‘God, this family is going through exactly what I did.’”
Although Tiffany’s case remains unsolved, 
Sessions said the recovery of Christian’s body was “nothing short of a miracle.”
With the amount of volunteers and law en-
forcement in the search, Tobias said he hadn’t seen a case impact a community in the same magnitude since the 1990 Danny Rolling mur-ders.
“Every single person in Gainesville knew 
about [Christian’s] case,” he said. “It took this 
community. It really did.”More than 400 people, including UF and SFC students, helped search

But it could cost $50 and a hold on 
ISIS.
From 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday 
through Friday, cars, scooters and 
motorcycles are barred from entrances 
on Stadium Road, Buckman Drive, Newell Drive and Union Road. 
Buses, emergency, state, service, 
disabled and authorized vehicles, 
however, are the exception.
Lt. William Gainey, who has worked for University Police for 14 years, said 
the barriers have been around for 
decades. 
But he remembered that up until 
five years ago, motor scooters were 
allowed.
Then, an accident with a Pepsi truck 
seriously injured a student on her scooter.
If a student is pulled over for the 
first time, he or she could receive a 
written warning, Gainey said. 
After a second time, a student can 
get a $50 citation that, like a campus 
parking ticket, goes on his or her student record.
It does not, however, accrue points to his or her driver’s license, according to an email from Ron Fuller, assistant 
director of UF Transportation and 
Parking Services.
The penalty for breaching the 
barriers is ultimately at the officer’s discretion, Gainey said. 
An officer can also choose to issue 
an official state of Florida moving citation, worth $154 and three points on your state driving record.
About 170 tickets were given 
between Fall 2012 and Summer 2013 for driving through the campus barriers.
But these tickets made up less than 1 
percent of a total 54,738 tickets issued. 
While 45 tickets were appealed, just 
six were dismissed.
Most students who are pulled over 
allege that they’re dropping a friend 
off or going to the infirmary, which is 
tucked inside the boundary on Fletcher Drive, Gainey said.
If students enter the barrier near 
Gale Lemerand Drive and Stadium 
Road to go to the infirmary, police will 
allow them to go through. 
If students are trying to go through 
any other way, they are redirected.
UF criminology junior Billy 
Burchfield has been pulled over by police for driving behind the barriers  twice — once on a scooter and once in a car.
He was driving through the barriers 
to get to Dauer Hall and Flint Hall, although he did not receive a ticket either time. 
Burchfield said police lecture him 
about the rules.
“They’re not benefiting anyone, 
and they’re inconveniencing a lot of us,” the 20-year-old said. “I can’t even 
think of why they’re there.”

Some UF students received an email from the 
Career Resource Center that was out of the norm 
Friday night.
The email raved about the prowess of a 
young singer, a UF alumna named Kimberly 
Percuoco, and urged students to check out her 
YouTube channel and her cover of Miley Cyrus’ “Wrecking Ball.”
“The email was scheduled in the system by 
a former student employee prior to his depar-ture and without the department’s knowledge,” said Heather White, director of the CRC, in an email sent two days later to students who are subscribed to Gator CareerLink help emails. 
“We are currently taking the necessary steps to 
address the student’s misconduct and to prevent any related issues from arising in the future.”
For Percuoco’s friend Lloyd Estes, who sent 
the email, these steps may include writing a formal apology to everyone who received the email and being evaluated by Student Affairs for breaking the UF Student Conduct and Honor Code, said Percuoco.
“My friend just wanted to help me out in any 
way he could,” said the 23-year-old. “I was try-ing to be happy, but I couldn’t support the be-havior.”
However, Percuoco said her video went from 
a little more than 2,000 views to about 4,000 in the days after the email was sent, her Facebook page saw 200 more likes, and she received about 30 new friend requests.
“It was kind of a double-edged sword,” she 
said. “If it were in any other forum that would have been more appropriate, of course, I would have been ecstatic.”CRC: Abnormal 
email about singer not OKBravo remains in jail as lawyers take depositions from witnesses
Abandoned
Three days into the search, GPD 
officers arrested Bravo on a charge 
of depriving a victim of medical care and booked him into the Alachua County Jail.
On Sept. 28, with no body recov-
ered, Gainesville Police announced Bravo would be charged with first-degree murder. Evidence revealed Bravo purchased a shovel and duct tape four days before Christian dis-appeared.
Reports also showed Bravo 
changed his story three times when 
detectives interviewed him a week 
earlier.
First, he said he dropped Chris-
tian off on Northwest 13th Street and denied fighting with him.
Then, he said he punched Chris-
tian in the face and forced him out of the car.
Finally, Bravo told police he got 
out of the car and beat Christian for “10 to 15 minutes” until he was “bloody, swollen and barely breath-ing or moving,” according to re-ports.  
Police also announced they found 
blood inside Bravo’s 2004 Chevrolet Blazer. Christian’s backpack was found stuffed in a suitcase in Bravo’s 
Spyglass Apartments room.
The search changed.
Police weren’t looking for Chris-
tian alive. They were looking for a body.
Discovery
As the search ticked close to its 
third week, an Alachua County grand jury indicted Bravo on capital murder and kidnapping charges. It also decided he would remain in jail 
without bond.
Following the indictment, the 
Aguilar family returned to Doral. 
Carlos and Claudia told their bosses they were taking more time off to look for Christian while Alex talked with teachers about missed class-work.  
On Oct. 12, as the family made its 
way again to Gainesville, two hunt-ers walked through the Gulf Ham-mock Hunting Club about 30 min-utes outside of Cedar Key.
As the hunters looked for fire-
wood, they smelled death. Maybe a rotting deer, they thought. Instead, they found a partially buried body off a dirt road.
The Levy County Sheriff’s Office 
responded and called Gainesville Police.Investigators worked to identify 
the remains, but the Aguilars be-lieved it was their son.
On Oct. 15, they got their confir-
mation.
The body, according to dental re-
cords, was Christian’s.
A year later
The Aguilars brought Christian’s 
remains back from Gainesville and buried them in Doral on Oct. 23, but they’ve struggled to heal since.
In a tight-knit family of four, 
there are now only three.
With one less dish to wash, an 
empty spot on the couch and an 
unused bedroom, the family can’t 
escape memories of Christian.
Carlos said his family turned to 
religion and therapy to help with the loss.
They founded the Christian Agu-
ilar Search and Rescue Foundation, an organization dedicated to using trained tracking dogs to find miss-ing victims.
“If you don’t do something good 
about this tragedy ... you will not re-cover,” he said.
Sebastian Arias, one of Chris-
tian’s closest friends growing up, is still coping with his friend’s death.
“I was really knocked off my 
feet,” Arias, 19, said. “Every time Christian comes up death-wise, it’s another smack to the face like, ‘OK. 
It’s real. Wake up.’”
And Alex, too, sometimes for-
gets.
He forgets about the three weeks 
he spent in Gainesville, walking 
through the woods looking for his brother.
He forgets he can’t text Christian 
— even though he keeps the contact 
information in his iPhone.
He forgets Christian’s not in his 
room, safe and sound, playing on 
his laptop.
But the worst of all, Alex said, is 
the silence in the house.
“That’s when you realize the 
gravity of what had happened,” he said.
Bravo remains in jail and faces 
multiple charges, including kidnap-ping, homicide, lying to police, pro-viding false reports, mishandling human remains, tampering with physical evidence, and poisoning food and/or water with the intent to 
kill or injure a person. He’s pled not 
guilty to all.
In the year since his arrest, Bravo 
has hired several lawyers in his de-fense.
Currently, the state attorney’s 
office and Bravo’s defense team are taking depositions from more than 100 witnesses.
“I want to know everything, so I 
can officially put it in my mind that he’s not coming back,” said Chris-tian’s friend Marcos Carriedo, 19.
The Alligator contacted the Bra-
vo family through a phone number listed for their address.
A man answered the phone and 
confirmed the number belonged to 
the family but did not want to iden-
tify himself.
“We’re going through a lot of 
emotional stress right now,” he said, declining to comment further.  
As the case slowly progresses 
toward a trial, which prosecutors believe might not happen until next year, Carlos said he won’t let it con-
tinue to hurt his loved ones.
“Christian would not like if I let 
that happened,” he said. “On my 
son’s name, I will not let this destroy my family.”ChRi StiAn , from page 4

Victoria’s Secret says 
it’s not about thinness
Yesterday, the creative director of the annual Victoria’s 
Secret Fashion Show talked to British Vogue about the 
casting criteria for the show’s models. Don’t drink any-
thing before reading on, unless you’re into spit-takes.
“It’s about being show-ready,” Sophia Neophitou-Apos-
tolou told Vogue. “It’s really like being an Olympian — they have to be in peak condition. It’s not about being thin or any-thing like that — it’s about being ready to perform and be the best you can be in that moment.”
In other news, college football players aren’t recruited 
based on their strength, speed and stats. It’s about, like, how much school spirit you have and just being the best player you can be at that moment.
It’s nice that Neophitou-Apostolou is dancing around it, 
but Americans aren’t idiots. Models’ jobs — at least, Victo-ria’s Secret models’ — entail not having any fat on their bod-ies. It’s a difﬁ  cult job, to be sure. Prior to the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show, model Adriana Lima eats only steamed or grilled green vegetables and four ounces of lean protein, and she works out two hours per day. In the nine days leading up to the show, she doesn’t eat any solid food — only protein shakes.  Twelve hours before the show, she will stop drink-
ing entirely. She claimed it was possible to lose up to eight 
pounds from abstaining from liquid for 12 hours.
Yeah, sounds exactly like being an Olympian.“The ﬁ  nal decision is made by the whole team, sitting at 
this long table in a room with really harsh lighting,” Neophi-tou-Apostolou told Vogue. “They all have to do it — even 
the contracted girls — and it’s incredibly nerve-wracking for 
them.”
Sorry, but what’s the parallel between this and being an 
Olympic athlete? Last time I checked, Olympians eat solid food.
Look, this is America. As Ron Swanson said, “The whole 
point of this country is if you want to eat garbage, balloon up to 600 pounds and die of a heart attack at 43, you can. You are free to do so. To me, that is beautiful.”
On the ﬂ  ip side, if you want to work out two hours a day, 
dehydrate yourself and abstain from all that’s beautiful in the world — like pizza and burritos — you’re free to do so.
But Neophitou-Apostolou is a liar. The Victoria’s Secret 
Fashion Show sells a fantasy of what women’s bodies look 
like. They, along with many other advertisers, rely on images 
of bodies that conform to a narrow physical ideal in order to convince the population that the products they sell — their lingerie, their low-calorie vodka and their dumb low-fat yo-
gurt — will help them ﬁ  t into this narrow ideal.
Meanwhile, according to the National Association of 
Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders, 81 percent of 
10-year-olds are afraid of getting fat, and almost half of girls from the ﬁ  fth to 12th grade reported wanting to lose weight 
because of magazine pictures.
But hey — it’s not about thinness.How we should be reacting to terrorism
The Washington Navy Yard shooting is one more 
dash of salt in the open wound of 2013. There have been at least 17 mass shootings since the at-
tack on Sandy Hook Elementary School in December of 2012, making it impossible to ignore the obvious need for changes in legislation surrounding gun control.
As coverage of the Sept. 16 shooting continued, 
people took to social media to express their frustrations with the lack of visible progress regarding gun control. Facebook and Twitter are viable places to discuss our aggravations about current events. They’re supposed to be megaphones for the masses. However, instead of hit-
ting enter on those 140 characters and calling it a day, 
we should follow the lead of creative individuals like Brian Peterson.
On the same day as the Navy Yard incident, an on-
line article was published describing photographer Bri-an Peterson’s attempts to help tsunami victims in Japan rebuild their lives. He founded the organization Photo-hoku, which aims to help victims heal by starting new photo albums.
Peterson and company conduct portrait sessions 
with the affected families who lost their homes and be-longings to the disaster. He uses instant ﬁ  lm cameras so his subjects can start new albums immediately. Now, he 
does the same in his home state of Oklahoma for fami-
lies devastated by the tornado chain in May. They also accept new and used digital cameras to distribute to victims so they can continue the project on their own.
Kristina Anderson wept after the Navy Yard shoot-
ing, which occurred just across the river from her ofﬁ  ce. Anderson was one of dozens shot in the 2007 attack at Virginia Tech. She ended up co-founding a company and a mobile app, LiveSafe, which promotes personal 
safety by supporting direct interaction with law en-
forcement. It also provides safety information about us-ers’ locations and alerts them to danger.Peterson affected change us-
ing his skills as a photographer, providing a symbol of hope in 
the form of a brand-new scrap-
book. Anderson turned her traumatic experience at Virgin-ia Tech into a technology that 
could prevent a repeat event.
It’s important to write to our 
respective leaders. We must have open dialogues about 
these traumatic events on social media. 
But until the wheels get turning, it might be best to 
turn our attention elsewhere. Let’s rally our unique tal-ents and experiences, and, like Peterson and Anderson, provide creative relief or prevention.
Like the many spectators who sprinted into the 
smoke after the Boston Marathon explosions, there will always be good-hearted people to pick up the pieces left behind by perpetrators of violence. 
While lawmakers grapple with each other and the 
current legislation to ﬁ  nd a solution, those of us outside 
the White House would be wise to spend our time ef-
fecting change in ways only we can.
This writer will be the ﬁ  rst to admit she knows little 
about the composition of new laws or the process to 
change existing ones. 
All she knows is that, as citizens, we can’t storm 
Washington and rewrite gun control laws ourselves. 
What we can do is react with positivity, implementing our individual skills to piece together the lives of those 
still reeling from the blasts, the tsunamis or the ﬁ  red 
shots.
This kind of violence will not wait for Washington 
to react. If we want change done right, we’d better start 
effecting it ourselves.

President Bill Clinton, once known 
for his love of fast food, has been making headlines for his recent 
dietary changes. He’s swapped the Big Macs, chicken nuggets and fried shrimp for veggie burgers, beans, and fresh fruits and vegetables. After years of battling heart problems — even undergoing quadruple bypass surgery — Clinton took his doctor’s advice to reduce his meat consumption and increase his intake of plant-based foods. He reports that the results have been tremen-dous: losing 24 pounds, feeling more energetic and seeing a welcome drop in cholesterol levels.
Clinton isn’t the only one turning over a new leaf:  
From Usher to Oprah Winfrey to Ellen DeGeneres to Kristen Bell, people everywhere are eating less meat. 
Even Mike Tyson, once known for biting off a 
human ear, is now limiting his ear consumption to those of the corn variety.
The movement toward more plant-based meals 
is also taking root on college campuses, with more than 200 universities, including the University of Florida, leading the charge with Meatless Monday campaigns in their dining halls.  
Nationally acclaimed food writers such as The 
New York Times’ Mark Bittman and the Washing-ton Post’s Joe Yonan are helping the nation discover meat-free dishes that will leave you impatient for the next meal. 
Eating your vegetables? If you don’t know the possibilities that phrase encompasses in 2013, you are missing out.  
There has never been a more exciting 
time to expand our dining horizons. 
Skipping meat one day a week is not 
a sacriﬁ  ce but an adventure. This is reﬂ  ected in the choices students are making. 
According to a study conducted by Technomic, 
more than 20 percent of college students are reduc-ing their meat consumption — and for good rea-sons.
One of those reasons is concern for the 9 billion 
chickens, pigs and other animals raised for food each year, most of which suffer in factory farms. 
For example, mother pigs in the pork industry are 
typically conﬁ  ned in tiny crates, barely larger than their own bodies, for virtually their entire lives. Un-able to even turn around, these sensitive, intelligent animals — all of which have their own personalities and preferences — experience tremendous physical and psychological pain.
Most egg-laying hens suffer a similar fate, as 
they’re crammed into tiny cages, each bird granted less space than the screen of an iPad on which to live for her entire life.
By choosing meat-free options just one day a 
week, we can all help prevent an enormous amount of cruelty to animals.
Kenny Torrella is the food policy coordinator for the 
Humane Society of the United States and can be reached at KTorrella@HumaneSociety.org.Meatless Monday on campus 
represents a positive movementColumnLast week, the Washington Navy Yard incident was the latest 
mass shooting to plague our country. Other shootings on this list include Columbine High School, Virginia Tech, Sandy Hook 
Elementary School and the Aurora movie theater massacre.  
A few places that do not appear on this 
list include Pearl High School, San Anto-nio Theater and Parker Middle School.  If you’re not familiar with these names, they all were shootings that would have been 
much worse if not for a law-abiding citizen 
with a gun.
Before I continue, let me make some-
thing perfectly clear: I am neither advo-
cating for everyone to have a gun on their 
waist, nor am I advocating for everyone to have the ability to purchase 
a ﬁ  rearm without a background check.
What I am trying to say is that a good guy with a gun actually 
checked a potential shooting. And afterward, there was not a discus-
sion about more gun control measures, which typically don’t work 
due to their arbitrary nature and general bureaucratic ineffectiveness. 
It is also important to make perfectly clear in our gun-control debate 
that all gun-control measures are not created equally. For example, ensuring those who are on the terrorist watch list are not permitted to purchase weapons — something that currently is not in place — is a 
sound and practical measure.
However, an arbitrary 15-round limit on ammunition magazines, 
which is in effect in Colorado, does not seem to be as credible an ef-
fort. Unfortunately, most of the proposed legislation that results after shootings is like the last example.
A Harvard study concluded that “nations with stringent gun con-
trols tend to have much higher murder rates than nations that allow guns.” Gun control predominantly only affects legal gun owners. Criminals — lawbreakers in nature — would not acquiesce to newly written gun laws.
In the background of our national dialogue, gun violence is actu-
ally decreasing even though states are reducing their gun laws.
After the Newtown massacre, the Obama administration sent Vice 
President Joe Biden to head the task force on gun violence. 
In his new role, Biden attended a meeting of the National Riﬂ  e As-
sociation and other gun-owning groups. A representative of the NRA later relayed something the vice president said to him during that meeting:  “We simply don’t have the time or manpower to prosecute everybody” who breaks a gun law. And yet, Biden’s task force ulti-mately concluded that the country needs, in fact, more gun laws.  
Our huge national bureaucracy enforces our gun legislation. It re-
cently failed us when it let the Navy Yard shooter slip through the cracks. Aaron Alexis was honorably discharged from the Navy, de-spite numerous disciplinary problems.
Before the shooting, Alexis shot someone’s tires and ceiling, and 
claimed that a microwave made him unable to speak. Though the police told the Navy about some of these incidents, they were not en-tered into the system.
“The Navy decided it was too hard to give him a general discharge 
... just because the bureaucracy couldn’t function,” Newt Gingrich said on CNN show “Crossﬁ  re.”  
A knee-jerk response to these shootings is to create gun-free zones. 
However, economists John Lott and William Landes conducted a study that found that mass shootings most often occur in places where guns are banned and where people are generally unarmed — schools and shopping centers, for example.  
The other tragedy is the fact that the federal government fails to 
come up with a solution to the declining state of our mental health system. It seems the only time we bring this up is after a mass shoot-
ing.
We must invest our time and effort into trying to repair the nation-
al mental health system. Doing so on its own merits is worth it, even 
if another shooting is not involved. This investment would arguably prevent future tragic events from occurring.     
In order for us to ensure a safer tomorrow, we need to make sure 
we know where our priorities lie. 
We should realize that more gun control does not correlate to a 
safer society and that ﬁ  xing the mental health system would make an 
immediate and positive difference.

Jaywalking enforcement is 
counterproductive
After reading about GPD’s anti-jaywalking 
initiative in the Alligator, I took care to le-gally cross the street before my weekly trip to 
Chipotle Mexican Grill.
As I was legally walking on the crosswalk 
on Northwest 15th Street, I heard an engine 
rev, and a GPD squad car nearly hit me — if I hadn’t stopped, the mirror would have clipped 
me. The ofﬁ  cer had sped around a line of cars 
at the red light — driving in the wrong lane of 
trafﬁ  c — and then ran the red light, causing trafﬁ  c on University Avenue to halt.
Because the ofﬁ  cer almost hit me in his rush 
to illegally cross the intersection, I ﬁ  gured 
there must have been a serious emergency or something else big going on, but then I heard 
the PA call out two jaywalkers.
I don’t disagree with the tickets them-
selves, but I think it’s ridiculous when ofﬁ  cers 
act recklessly and break laws “to keep every-
one safe.”
I’ll admit it — I’ve jaywalked before, but 
I’ve never been closer to getting hit by a car 
than when I was legally crossing on the cross-
walk. When the actions of ofﬁ  cers uphold-
ing the law — possibly hitting pedestrians or causing collisions on University Avenue — are more dangerous than the crime itself, 
enforcement becomes 100 percent counterpro-
ductive.

The gun-control debate is now 
brewing at Starbucks, and locals 
are chiming in about an open let-
ter the coffee shop chain’s CEO issued last week.
In the letter, published on the 
Starbucks website, CEO Howard 
Schultz asked patrons to keep 
guns out of the cafes.
Lt. Todd Kelly, Alachua 
County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce public in-formation ofﬁ  cer, said the letter 
perhaps  identiﬁ  es the problem incorrectly.
“Generally, the people with a 
carry license are the people who 
help law enforcement in an emer-
gency because they have the train-ing,” Kelly said. “They should be seen as public allies, not potential criminals.”
In Schultz’s letter, he wrote, 
“We are respectfully requesting 
that customers no longer bring 
ﬁ  rearms into our stores or out-
door seating areas — even in states where ‘open carry’ is per-mitted.” 
He said it was not a reaction 
to the Sept. 16 Washington D.C. Navy Yard shooting.
Schultz later explained the 
message was necessary after the 
company’s neutral gun policy was ignored by a series of recent na-tionwide pro-gun protests inside Starbucks cafes.
“The presence of a weapon in 
our stores is unsettling and up-
setting for many of our custom-
ers,” he wrote.
Joey Siracusa, a 20-year-old 
UF computer engineering junior, 
said the CEO’s statement lacks 
authority.
“I would guess that anyone 
who intended to ﬁ  re their weap-
on in (my workplace) would do so with or without permission 
from the CEO,” said Siracusa, who works at Moe’s Southwest 
Grill on Fletcher Drive.
Tyler Brookins, a 19-year-
old UF biology sophomore who works at the Archer Road Panera Bread, said the food industry, particularly coffee shops, doesn’t mix well with gun control.
“I work at a safe place, and 
people who would make me un-
comfortable don’t typically come 
in,” said Brookins.
Managers at the downtown 
Starbucks, located at 201 SE First St., declined to comment on the 
letter speciﬁ  cally but said they 
hope their customers will view it with respect.8, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 2013

>> In Alachua County, gun

>> A written or oral request

   When Jeff Driskel went down with a 
season-ending injury against Tennessee, 
backup quarterback Tyler Murphy took 
advantage of a golden opportunity.
  In his ﬁ  rst stretch of signiﬁ  cant play-
ing time at Florida, Murphy tallied 218 
all-purpose yards and two touchdowns 
during a 31-17 victory against Tennessee on Saturday in The Swamp.
  Since then, Murphy has quickly com-
manded the national spotlight.
  Some have compared him to Tim 
Tebow. South Carolina coach Steve Spur-rier called him the “most impressive player in college football” last weekend. There was even a phony Twitter account 
impersonating Murphy.
  Also, his cell phone will not stop buzz-
ing with text messages from friends and 
family.
  So, Tyler, what have the past 48 hours 
been like?
  “They’ve been a little hectic, I guess 
you could say,” Murphy said.

  When right guard Jon Halapio fell to his 
knees during the ﬁ  rst quarter against Ten-
nessee on Saturday, it appeared as if the red-
shirt senior had re-aggravated the partially 
torn pectoral muscle that caused him to miss Florida’s ﬁ  rst two games of the season.
  Luckily for the Gators, Halapio’s injury 
was less serious. He suffered a gash near his eye that required three stitches but was able to return to the game wearing a protective mask and help No. 19 Florida beat Tennes-see 31-17.
  “I thought it was 
his [pectoral muscle],” coach Will Muschamp said. “I went on the 
ﬁ  eld, and I looked up, 
and he was bleeding out of his eye.”
  Halapio is expected to be available for 
Florida against Kentucky on Saturday at 7 
p.m. Prior to sitting out against Toledo and 
Miami, the right guard had suited up in 27 
consecutive games for UF — the most by any active player.
  “I wish we had more (players like Halap-
io),” Muschamp said. “He’s a typical throw-back. … He’s playing through a lot of pain, probably. He won’t tell me, but I know he is.”
  Leon Orr (shoulder), Marcus Roberson 
(knee), Loucheiz Purifoy (thigh contusion) and Tyler Moore (ankle) are also likely to play against the Wildcats.
  The news is not as promising for Valdez

AS STEIN ON TV
 Will Muschamp announced on Monday that quarter-
back Jeff Driskel’s fractured ﬁ  bula will keep the ju-nior out of commission for 4-6 months. 
  For Gators fans, the next half of a year is going to be painful 
to watch.
  Let’s get this straight: Replacement quarterback Tyler Mur-
phy is not Florida’s savior, and you should not expect him to be.
  Look for Murphy’s body of work at UF. There isn’t one.  This is a guy who was starting for the scout team this time 
last year and is now being thrust into the high-pressure role of Florida’s starting quarterback. He may not wilt under that pressure, but you should not be ex-pecting him to blossom.
  Until Saturday, Murphy never 
even garnered speculation that he might get playing time, let alone a 
starting gig.
  Quarterbacks have come and 
gone without Murphy moving past 
third on the depth chart until this season.
  Murphy’s freshman season was a prime opportunity to es-
tablish himself as at least a contender for playing time. With John Brantley proving to be unreliable at best, the Gators turned to a future tight end and a future wide receiver — Jordan Reed and Trey Burton, respectively. Meanwhile, Murphy did not get on the ﬁ  eld. Instead, he redshirted.
  In 2011, true freshmen Jacoby Brissett and Driskel both 
passed Murphy on the depth chart to relieve an injured Brant-ley.
  And with an open quarterback position leading up to the 
2012 season, Murphy was passed over completely.
  Prior to Saturday, the highlight of Murphy’s career was:  Do not look to Murphy as savior for ﬂ  awed Florida offense

  Alumni weekend provided some-
thing greater than just the bond of being 
a Gator.
  When Florida took the ﬁ  eld against Ala-
bama on Friday, former Gators throughout the program’s 18-year history were there in support of the players still in the midst of 
ﬁ  guring it all out.
  “These are players that are bonded for 
life because of the experience they had 
here,” coach Becky Burleigh said.
Florida’s sole game of the weekend    gave 
the younger players a chance to connect with those who were once in their shoes.
  “When the older players have the per-
spective of being gone — for whether 
it’s a year or 10 years or 15 years — and 
then they come back and talk to the cur-rent team,” Burleigh said. “It’s really hard when you’re in the situation to appreciate it or to have any perspective on what it’s 
doing for you.
  “When they hear the same things over 
and over again from so many of the former 
players — the ability to deal with adver-
sity, conﬁ  dence, all these things that they 
feel like they took from being a part of this program — I think it makes the younger players understand that they’re a part of something bigger than just themselves.”
  With the freshmen as the face of Flor-
ida’s (7-1-1, 1-0 Southeastern Conference) program this season, alumni weekend served as a learning experience for the 
young team prior to facing two SEC op-
ponents — Mississippi (8-1-1, 1-0 SEC) on Friday and Missouri (5-4, 1-0 SEC) on Sun-day.
  Burleigh said this weekend’s matchups 
will test everything the team has practiced and discussed so far this season, and the 
freshmen will see ﬁ  rsthand what playing a 
full weekend in the SEC is like.
  “The young players are just going to 
have to get preparation for that from the 
older players,” Burleigh said. 
  “It’s a big deal when you go on the road 
and the other teams are always against you and the fans are against you, and the en-
vironment is against you. When you sign up to be a Florida Gator you kind of know that going in, but experiencing it is differ-
ent than knowing about it.”
  Freshman forward Savannah Jordan 
made quick work of the Crimson Tide’s 
defense, scoring two goals in the ﬁ  rst half 
to give the Gators a lead before halftime. It 
was her fourth two-goal game of the sea-son.  “Her transition has been pretty smooth,” 
Burleigh said. 
“Especially because she came in Janu-
ary; I think that helped her get used to 
what college soccer is all about.” 
The SEC named Jordan the league’s 
Freshman of the Week on Monday.   
  Her pair of goals Friday gave her 10 this 
season, making her fourth all time among 
UF freshmen. 
Andi Sellers has the record with 23 
goals as a freshman during the 1997 sea-son. Abby Wambach scored 19 in 1998; Me-lissa Pini  totaled 11 in 1995.
  Burleigh said after the team met with the 
alumni during the weekend that the young players gained some insight into their roles moving forward. 
  “The jersey that says Gators, everyone 
in that room has worn, everybody in that room has gone through the highs and the lows, and they came out on the outside and have been stronger because of it,” Burleigh said. “That’s a great message for the young-er players to hear while they’re here.” 14, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 2013

UF coachSOCCER“Played an important role on scout teams.”
Yes, Murphy did perform admirably filling in for 
Driskel against Tennessee. 
But you should not be overwhelmed by his 
game.
Tennessee is 82nd in the country in pass defense, 
behind programs such as Florida International, Kent 
State and Ball State. His numbers — 8-of-14 passing for 134 yards and 84 rushing yards — were solid, es-pecially for a guy who admitted he thought he might never play. But he didn’t light up the scoreboard. 
If you don’t think Driskel was on his way to a 
similar — if not better — performance, then you’re missing something.
Driskel threw all over Tennessee last year and had 
already made a pass of 21 — an explosive play for a conservative offense —yards before he suffered his injury. 
The Gators were prepared to test the Volunteers 
deep, and Driskel would have taken advantage of this.
Murphy will likely put up decent numbers against 
Kentucky next week, too. Try to contain yourself 
when he does — the Wildcats are the perennial door-
mats of the Southeastern Conference. 
Back in August, I watched Murphy take reps as 
a backup during Florida’s open practices. Watching him, redshirt freshman Skyler Mornhinweg and true freshman Max Staver, my thought was, “Florida is in trouble if Driskel gets hurt.”
A month and one mostly Driskel-less game later, 
I still believe that.
But, if all goes well for Florida, Murphy won’t 
have a monumental task in front of him. 
The Gators’ defense is the focal point of the team, 
and the offense is built around pounding the football on the ground.
If everything goes according to Muschamp’s plan, 
all Murphy will need to do is occasionally challenge opposing defenses and not turn the ball over.
But nothing ever goes according to plan. If some-
thing can go wrong, it will. 
That’s Murphy’s Law.the game. Colin Thompson will be out 1-2 weeks after devel-
oping a stress fracture in his foot. 
“I’m disappointed for Colin,” Muschamp said. “He was 
really starting to progress and do well for us.”
Special teams troubles: A year removed from being 
named a finalist for the Ray Guy Award — given annually to the nation’s best punter — Kyle Christy could soon find himself without a job.
The junior led the Southeastern Conference and set a 
school record by averaging 45.8 yards per punt in 2012, but he has not been nearly as effective this season. 
Florida is eighth in the SEC with a net average of 38.1 
yards per punt. Muschamp said on Monday that freshman 
Johnny Townsend would be considered for the job. 
“We’ll pull the redshirt off Johnny if we need to,” Mus-
champ said. “We need to get more production at the punter 
position.”
Muschamp has been equally frustrated with Florida’s 
kicking woes. 
Austin Hardin is just 3 of 5 on field goal tries — the red-
shirt freshman missed a 39-yard attempt against Toledo and a 41-yarder against Tennessee — leaving Muschamp unin-
spired. 
As a result, senior Brad Phillips, who suffered a ham-
string injury during training camp, will be given a chance.
“I’m going to give Brad some live looks this week in prac-
tice and see how he responds,” Muschamp said.
Sophomore honored: After turning in a subpar perfor-
mance against Miami on Sept. 7, Buck linebacker Dante 
Fowler Jr. was unstoppable against Tennessee.
The sophomore forced two fumbles, one of which he re-
covered to end Tennessee’s opening possession, and had three tackles for loss, including one sack. Because of his per-formance, Fowler was named the SEC Defensive Player of the Week. 
“I just wanted to come out and play fast,” Fowler said. TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 15

Gators re-opening punter and kicker battles 
What Murphy accomplished Saturday was 
what Miami coach Al Golden first envisioned 
when the Gators called the two-star recruit in 
January of 2010. Despite Murphy’s commitment 
to Golden’s Owls, the coach supported Murphy’s decision to visit Gainesville.
“He said he would encourage that because it 
was a program that not many get chances, a place that not too many people get a chance to play at,” Murphy said of Golden’s response. “So he was very encouraging, and he was really helpful to the process.”
Until Florida called, Temple was the only FBS 
program to offer Murphy a scholarship to play quarterback. UConn and Syracuse both offered Murphy as an athlete.
“I wasn’t happy about it,” Murphy said. “I 
played quarterback all my life. I wanted to con-tinue playing quarterback. It was just something I thought I was good enough to do at the next level, so I didn’t want to sell myself short.”
After hearing of Murphy’s performance, Gold-
en told the Palm Beach Post on Monday, “We got cherry picked.”
Although Murphy waited three years, two 
games and half a quarter before getting his shot 
as Florida’s quarterback, he did not simply wait 
for opportunity to knock.
He always prepared for the moment his num-
ber would be called — if it was even called at all. 
Defensive back Jaylen Watkins, Murphy’s former 
roommate, said the signal-caller’s work ethic has never wavered, no matter where he fell on the depth chart.
“I’ve witnessed him put in work consistently,” 
Watkins said. “He went from being a third-string quarterback. He always prepared like his chance was going to come.”
While teammates play video games, Murphy 
joins them to hang out. But he brings his laptop with him. Some sort of football is always on his screen.
“He won’t play,” Watkins said. “He just sits 
there and watches film.”
But Murphy doesn’t exclusively watch the 
Gators. He watches a lot of NFL footage.
His favorite player is New Orleans Saints 
quarterback Drew Brees.
“I’m definitely going to try to take some things 
that he’s done,” Murphy said of emulating Brees. 
“He encourages the guys to do well and stuff 
like that. I’m definitely going to try to keep en-couraging my teammates to excel.”
Murphy is grateful for his teammates’ support 
as he battled for playing time, and he hopes they will help him stay the course now that he’s the starting quarterback. 
Hard work got him to where is now. He does 
not want waste his new opportunity.
“I told them that if they feel like I’m not work-
ing as hard as I was before, don’t be afraid to call me out because, as a team, we’ve got to hold each 
other accountable and stuff like that,” Murphy 
said. “Nobody is perfect.”Murphy threw

   During the past 13 years, the Gators 
have gone to the NCAA tournament 
every season and have won the South-eastern Conference 11 times. 
  Many great players have taken the 
O’Connell Center court during that time, but after 13 years of Heather Wright holding the UF record for hit-ting percentage, senior Chloe Mann set a new mark on Saturday. 
Mann seized the 
record by hitting an errorless .583 with seven kills against 
Wisconsin-Milwau-
kee in No. 4 Flori-da’s (11-1) three-set 
sweep.   
  “That’s some-
thing that’s pretty 
amazing to do,” assistant coach Da-vid Boos said.  “Not only the fact that Chloe did it, but what she does for us 
in terms of daily.” 
    It took 1,200 attempts for Mann to 
be eligible for the record. She reached 
the mark Saturday. Wright had a ca-reer hitting percentage of .424; Mann is currently hitting at .465 for her career.
  Even though Mann had an im-
pressive season last year  — she was named SEC Player of the Year and a 
2012 American Volleyball Coaches As-
sociation First Team All-American — she may be playing even better in her ﬁ  nal season for the Gators. 
  She currently ranks No. 4 in the na-
tion in hitting percentage at .504.  The numbers are impressive considering the amount of attacks Mann takes.

        With Week 3 of the NFL season 
in the books, here are a few former 
Gators who made the most tangible 
impact for their respective teams. 
       Major Wright, safety: Ma-jor Wright has caused major problems for opposing passing 
offenses in 2013. That contin-
ued during the Chicago Bears’ matchup against the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday night. 
  Wright intercepted a pass 
from quarterback Ben Roeth-lisberger in the second quarter and returned it 38 yards for a touchdown to give the Bears a 
24-3 lead.   So far in 2013, Wright has 
proved his ability to play in the box and off the edge in Chica-
go’s Cover-2 shell. 
His numbers certainly speak 
for themselves: 24 combined 
tackles, one interception and 
two forced fumbles. 
  Wright and fellow safety 
Chris Conte combined for six interceptions in 2012.   That 
trend should continue as this 
season progresses. 
    Matt Elam, safety: The Bal-
timore Ravens no longer have 
linebacker Ray Lewis or safety 
Ed Reed, but they do have a group of playmakers to ﬁ  t their hard-nosed style of play, in-cluding former UF safety Matt Elam. 
  Despite limited action on 
Sunday, Elam collected a ca-reer-high four tackles. He also added one pass deﬂ  ection. 
More importantly, he show-
cased his aggressive style by attacking receivers who came across the middle, an aspect of his game that Baltimore — an 
organization that puts a pre-
mium on strength and physical play — covets. 
    Carlos Dunlap, defen-
sive end: For two consecutive weeks, Dunlap has been a key cog in the Cincinnati Bengals defense for a variety of reasons: pass-rush ability, containment on the edge and inﬂ  uence in 
stopping opponents’ passing 
attack.
  Dunlap recorded a season-
high six tackles in Sunday’s 
victory, his ﬁ  rst registered sack 
of the season and two pass de-ﬂ  ections. 
  His play spearheaded the 
Bengals, who beat the Green 
Bay Packers 34-30 in a sloppy, 
turnover-ﬁ  lled game. 
  Through three games, Dun-
lap has recorded 12 tackles — 
most among Cincinnati’s defen-
sive lineman — and 1.5 sacks. 
    Notes: Former Gators run-
ning back Chris Rainey worked out for the Kansas City Chiefs 
on Monday and ran the 40-yard 
dash in the low 4.3s, according to Pro Football Talk. 
Rainey played for the Steel-
ers last season and appeared in 16 games, scoring two touch-downs, before being released during the offseason. 
  Tight end Jordan Reed suf-
fered a quad contusion after taking a hit to the leg in Sun-day’s game against the Detroit Lions. With starter Fred Davis 
sidelined, Reed has become 
Washington’s No. 1 receiving option at tight end. 
The former Gator hauled in 
ﬁ  ve catches for 50 yards on six 
targets a week after scoring his 
ﬁ  rst NFL touchdown. 
  Kicker Caleb Sturgis contin-
ued a ﬂ  awless start to his NFL 
career by connecting on two 
ﬁ  eld goals to help the Miami Dolphins beat the Atlanta Fal-cons 27-23. 16, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 2013
