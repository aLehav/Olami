NEED TO KNOW IF YOU 
WANT TO BRING YOUR 
CAR TO CAMPUS
By Eve Thompson
Alligator Staff Writer
Following the start of the se -
mester with more in-person class -
es, students must consider how 
they get to campus and where to 
park when they arrive. Parking 
at UF is frustrating for many stu -
dents because of the decal system 
and rigid restrictions on lots and 
garages. 
Here’s a guide for how to ap -
peal a citation, what to do when 
impounded and where to park on 
campus to avoid hefty citation 
costs.
Parking Options On and Off Campus
To park on campus, all stu -
dents must purchase a student de -
cal based on their credit hours and 
where they live. All decals cost 
$160 annually, $80 per semester, 
$35 monthly or $15 for one week.
Most parking lots on campus 
are restricted Monday through 
Friday from 7:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. 
Parking is free outside of those 
hours, but some marked lots, in -
cluding the Murphree and Fletch -
er lots, are always restricted.
Undergraduate students who 
live off campus can order a Park 
and Ride decal, but spaces on 
campus are limited. Students with 
this decal can only park in lots 
marked “Any Decal” and take a 
bus to the main area of campus, 
as these lots tend to be farther 
away. 
On-campus undergraduate stu -
dents who have completed 50 or 
more credit hours can buy a Red 1 
decal, and they can park in all red 
lots, including those marked Red 
1, or lots marked “Any Decal.”
On-campus students with few -
er than 50 credit hours can pur -
chase a Red 3 decal to park in red and “Any Decal” lots.
The Welcome Center Park -
ing Garage, which is connected 
to both the Reitz Union and the 
campus bookstore, is open to ev -
erybody and does not require the 
purchase of a decal. The garage 
operates Monday through Friday 
from 7:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.
The standard daily fee is $6, 
the two-hour fee is $4 and it costs 
$2 to park for 45 minutes. There is 
no cost on weekends, before 7:30 
a.m. or after 4:30 p.m.
Some students choose to park 
in the Southwest Downtown Ga -
rage, located off SW 2nd St. It 
costs $1 per hour from 6 a.m. to 
6 p.m. or a monthly rate of $25. It 
is a 30-minute walk from the main 
campus, or a 20-minute bus ride.
For a more convenient parking 
option, others turn to scooters, 
which can only be parked in lots 
marked Motorcycle/Scooter. To 
park in these lots, you must also 
purchase a decal, which costs the 
same as a car decal.
How to Appeal a Citation
It can be easy to park in the 
wrong place or misplace your 
vehicle in a rush to get to your 
classes. In that case, you will like -
ly receive a parking citation, but 
don’t worry. Here’s how to appeal 
it, and hopefully, get your fine re -
duced.
UF Transportation and Park -
ing Services hands out 59,000 
parking citations annually. Fees 
range from $15 to $250; howev -
er, students can appeal them to 
get the fee waived under certain 
circumstances. Citations must be 
appealed in writing either online, 
by mail or in person at the TAPS 
Customer Relations Office, located 
at 1273 Gale Lemerand Drive.
Students must submit their ap -
peals within 15 days of issuance 
or must pay a $10 late fee. If a stu -
dent is not satisfied with the result 
of their appeal, they can appeal it 
again in writing, at the office or online within 15 days, but all ci -
tations must be paid in full first. 
Then, the payment will be refund -
ed if the appeal is successful.
The student traffic court de -
cides the outcome of an appeal, 
and they research the appellant’s 
citation history and views photo -
graphs of the infraction. To suc -
cessfully appeal a citation, the 
appellant should explain the situ -
ation in full, as well as provide 
evidence if possible. 
What to Do When T owed
Having your vehicle towed can 
be a nightmare, and TAPS can tow 
a car if it is parked in the wrong 
lot, if it has been abandoned or 
if multiple parking citations have 
not been dealt with in 15 days. A 
car can also be towed if it is ob -
structing traffic or creating a road 
hazard, or if a decal has been sus -
pended. However, a call or a visit 
to TAPS can resolve the problem 
and get your car back.
There is a $50 impound fee, 
and all citations must be paid be -
fore picking your car up from the 
impound lot at the TAPS Custom -
er Relations Office, open Monday 
through Friday between 8 a.m. 
and 4:30 p.m. Outside of those 
hours, students should call the 
University Police Department.

YOU’VE JUST ARRIVED IN YOUR 
NEW TOWN AND HAVE NO IDEA 
WHAT IT HAS TO OFFER. LUCKILY, 
GAINESVILLE OFFERS PLENTY OF 
FUN SPOTS TO TRY
By Abigail Hasebroock
Alligator Staff Writer
Gainesville is associated almost 
exclusively with all things UF — especially 
for new students  from pockets of Florida 
and across the country who wouldn’t be 
able to point to where Gainesville is on a 
map. 
While UF has much to offer, Gainesville 
itself does too. It doesn’t take many miles 
of driving or even walking to find fun spots 
to hang out, eat and enjoy memorable 
experiences that make college worth it.
Feeline Good Cat Cafe
Nestled among busy bars and crowded 
coffee shops, Gainesville’s only cat cafe 
resides in the heart of downtown. The 
cafe, located at 201 SE Second Place, offers 
customers the chance to book up to two 
hours with a room full of cats. Customers 
can also make a pit stop to pick up coffee 
and a pastry before or after their visit in the 
cat room, but the cafe provides tables and 
chairs inside and out, which can be used 
for studying or catching up with friends. 
The space is open with a minimalist design, 
and the designated cat room is decorated 
with a plethora of cat trees and colorful 
toys.  
Feeline Good opened on June 21, and the 
cats are provided by the Humane Society 
of North Central Florida. After spending a 
session with the cats, if a customer wants 
to adopt one (or two) they can do so and 
bring home a new pet.
Midpoint Park & Eatery
Located in Gainesville’s innovation 
district, Midpoint Park & Eatery provides 
an enjoyable outdoor experience for people 
of all ages, abilities and diets. While the 
space itself is small, it packs a punch 
with four food trucks, plenty of places to sit and string lights that create a relaxing 
ambience. 
The park resides at 931 SW Second 
Ave. and has ample parking availability in 
the lot located right next to it. However, 
the walk to Midpoint from campus is less 
than 10 minutes, so students could grab 
a meal between classes or stop by to do 
homework, especially during the cooler 
months.
Visitors wishing to get a bite to eat 
can stop by Da Kine Poke, a Hawaiian-
inspired poke bowl food truck that also 
offers vegetarian and vegan options;, Mexi 
Cocina, which offers authentic Mexican 
cuisine with menu items like tacos and 
quesadillas;, Keller’s Kitchen, where people 
can sink their teeth into classic American 
favorites and last but not least, Plantology, 
which provides fully vegan comfort food. 
Students and families alike can visit 
Midpoint anytime between 11 a.m. and 8 
p.m. Monday through Saturday, making it 
a perfect place to stop by with friends on 
a weekend afternoon or pit stop for dinner 
after a long day of classes.
4th Ave Food Park
Similar to Midpoint, 4th Ave Food Park, 
located at 409 SW Fourth4th Ave, offers 
an array of places to eat, an abundance of 
outdoor seating and live music. 
The restaurants include Satch Squared, 
Fehrenbacher’s Artisan Sausages, 
Humblewood Fire, Feliz Flavors, 
BakerBaker, Sublime Tacos and an Opus 
Airstream. Food items range from lattes to 
bagel sandwiches to vegan and vegetarian 
friendly Mexican tacos making it the perfect 
place to stop by at any time of the day 
accompanied byand with any one with any 
kind of dietary restrictions or preferences.
Customers can enjoy their food at tables 
with colored tiles with a view of a mural 
in the background while listening to live 
local artists. Pets are welcome, and the 
large open space makes it safe and fun for 
people of all ages. This makes it the perfect 
place to bring family members and friends 
from home when they come to visit. 
High Dive
If the live music at 4th Ave or Midpoint 
isn’t enough, Gainesville’s High Dive is dedicated to presenting live music and 
events, showcasing the talents of many 
local artists and bands. The music venue is 
located at 210 SW Second Ave in downtown 
Gainesville surrounded by several other 
bars and restaurants. 
This Fall, the High Dive is welcoming 
flipturn, Mayday Parade, Chris Renzema, 
and Hobo Johnson and The Lovemakers, 
just to name a few. 
Season passes are available for frequent 
concert-goers each semester, but tickets to 
individual shows can also be purchased. 
Beyond music, the High Dive hosts comedy 
shows and other events like a food truck 
rally. 
Depot Park
Craving a picnic, bike ride, a playground 
visit or a bite to eat? Any of these can be 
found at Depot Park located at 200 SE 
Depot Ave. 
The park offers green spaces, benches, 
tables and sidewalks, which can all be 
enjoyed with the view of a fountain. The 
Depot Station sits right next to the park 
and offers places to eat and drink, and it 
can also be reserved for events as big as 
weddings.
The park allows direct access onto the Gainesville-Hawthorne State Trail, which 
provides bikers, runners and walkers 16 
miles of a scenic, somewhat curvy route 
with overlooks and wildlife along the way. 
Depot Park’s vast, open, outdoor space 
provides a safe way to gather with friends 
whether for a stroll along the park’s 
sidewalks or playing a card game on the 
grass.
Paynes Prairie
Fans of the Gainesville-Hawthorne State 
Trail might also enjoy a visit to Paynes 
Prairie Preserve State Park, whether to 
hike a trail or enjoy a sunset by pulling off 
to the side of US-441 South. 
Less than 10 miles away from campus, 
the park offers various trails including La 
Chua, Bolen Bluff and Cone’s Dike. The 
park is open from 8 a.m. to sunset, and 
traversing the trails promises beautiful 
green scenery and a high likelihood of 
wildlife from deer to bunnies and even 
bison. 
Florida may be flat, but hiking 
opportunities in Gainesville are not scarce, 
and Paynes Prairie is proof of that.

OUR STAFF COVERS SOME OF THE CITY’S 
BEST COFFEE SPOTS
Wyatt’s Coffee
Customer service in a cup 
Wyatt’s Coffee gives Gainesville 
refreshing drinks in a welcoming 
atmosphere  
Iced or hot, whole milk or oat milk, 
espresso or brewed — coffee combina -
tions are the fuel behind a college town. 
At 202 SE Second Ave., Wyatt’s Cof -
fee provides a full selection of traditional and seasonal coffees, 
teas and refreshments. 
The clean, open-concept coffee bar invites customers from 
their first step in the store. With Wi-Fi available and tables 
meant for two, there’s always space to stay awhile. 
Without a drive-thru or separate parking lot, it can be dif -
ficult to swing by in a rush. The corner shop shares city street 
parking with the surrounding businesses. 
Whether it’s the nitro cold brew or the baked goods that 
draw you in, the store’s welcoming staff and mission to give 
back to the Gainesville community has earned its spot in your 
morning routine. 
Wyatt’s Coffee is open 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. seven days a week.
Karma Cream
Good karma in a cup
Karma Cream offers energizing coffee 
and bites for students and locals alike
I’m lazy. I don’t like putting much ef -
fort into a plan when I already have a 
day of studying ahead of me. So I go to 
Karma Cream, where I can load up on 
all the caffeine, snacks or sweets I could ever need and barely 
leave my seat.
Located at 607 W. University Ave., the cafe is a short walk 
from UF’s campus, though a bike or bus may be your best bet in the summer heat. It has a welcoming and energizing atmo -
sphere, and the vegan menu boasts loaded sandwiches, baked 
goods and even ice cream made with coconut milk. From break -
fast to dessert, you could spend the whole day there if you so 
desired.
The energy continues with the friendly baristas and dynamic 
playlists. On a rainy day you’re bound to hear some punk and 
emo songs, which really helps me live out my main character 
meets struggling writer fantasy. Truth is, the music depends on 
who’s working. The more you go, the more you pick up on each 
barista’s taste.
If you prefer a quiet workspace you may want to pack your 
headphones or come earlier in the morning before the corner 
tables are snatched.
At night, the cafe can serve as a fun way to end your day 
with some ice cream on your way home or a caffeinated pick-
me-up before a night out.
Karma Cream is open 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. Monday through Fri -
day, 10 a.m to 10 p.m. Saturday and 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Sunday.
Coffee Culture
Coffee Cultutre:  A cure for your 
caffeine cravings
The cafe on 13th Street will put a 
mug in your hand in no time
When I’ve got a craving for caffeine, 
Coffee Culture is my go-to. Unassuming 
on the outside, the shop, located at 2020 
NW 13th St., has some of the nicest baristas and the tastiest cof -
fee concoctions in Gainesville. 
The main room inside is cozy, with lots of natural light and 
a small stage in the corner for pre-pandemic open mic nights. 
People walk in, out and about, and the whirring of machines 
from the kitchen creates a lo-fi buzz — perfect work conditions 
for me. The back room is quieter, and boasts big, comfy chairs 
and a small library. 
I haven’t found another cafe that can make my bever -
age as quickly as they do at Coffee Culture without sac -
rificing quality. Add in the themed monthly specials, and Coffee Culture can’t be beat. 
Coffee Culture is open from 6 a.m. to 7p.m. every day except 
Sunday, when it opens an hour later at 7 a.m. and closes at 7 
p.m.
Pascal’s Coffeehouse 
Coffee, community and care:  the Pascal’s 
Promise
The coffeehouse offers all kinds of 
coffee, tea and pastries, which can all 
be enjoyed from a seat at its indoor and 
outdoor dining  
The first time I traversed to Pascal’s 
Coffeehouse was during the first week 
of my freshman year. I was desperate to find a community, and 
one of UF’s ministries, Cru, was hosting a game night at Pascals 
located right off campus at 112 NW 16th St. 
I didn’t even realize the beautiful, spacious building I spent 
that one fateful evening in was a coffee shop until a couple of 
weeks later. The string lights, windows, bookshelves and stair -
case that leads to a second story create a cozy ambience further 
fostered by the kind baristas who always ask thoughtful ques -
tions with a genuineness that can’t be fabricated.
Even amid the tumultuous Fall of last year when the future 
of the entire world was uncertain and life felt rather aimless, 
I loved the many early mornings I spent sitting by a window 
listening to the faint sound of instrumental jazz while I attended 
a class on Zoom, read a book or journaled. The atmosphere im -
mediately puts me into a peaceful, calm state of mind, and the 
fact that they serve what I believe to be the best coffee drink in 
all of Gainesville — an iced Cuban latte with oat milk — doesn’t 
hurt. 
Pascal’s offers a selection of other kinds of coffee that ex -
presses a clear care for the craft, and non-coffee drinkers can 
enjoy tea or munching on a fresh pastry. 
Pascal’s is open from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday through Sat -
urday, and who knows? Maybe it will host some more game 
nights, too. The Alligator Guide to Gainesville Coffee Shops

GATOR DINING SERVICES 
OFFERS BOTH RESIDENTIAL 
AND COMMUTER 
MEAL PLANS
By Juliana Ferrie 
Alligator Staff Writer 
While managing a nerve-
wrecking transition into college, 
there’s one particular concern 
that may cross a new student’s 
mind: food. 
Figuring out how to navigate 
meals can be a challenge. At 
UF, Gator Dining Services offers 
several different meal plans 
students can choose from. With 
over 50 on-campus dining options, 
meal plans make eating easy, 
and choices can be found close 
to all academic buildings, Nicole 
Jackson, Gator Dining director of 
student engagement, wrote in an 
email. 
For freshmen, hanging out 
in the dining area is a big part 
of their college experience, 
Jackson wrote. When it comes to 
upperclassmen, the focus is on 
convenience, she wrote. 
“Being a meal plan member with Gator Dining makes both of 
those experiences satisfying and 
memorable,” Jackson wrote. 
Gator Dining Services offers 
both residential and commuter 
meal plans, according to its 
website. Students living on 
campus can choose from the 
Unlimited Orange 450, Unlimited 
Blue 250, Unlimited 5-Day 375 
or the Gator Weekly 10 plans. 
Two of the unlimited plans allow 
students to eat at the dining 
hall as many times as they want 
throughout the week. The third 
offers unlimited dining hall access 
Monday through Friday. All four 
options include varying amounts 
of Flex Bucks, which can be 
used to purchase food at dining 
locations. 
When a student selects an 
unlimited plan, they can also use 
one Cash Exchange swipe worth 
$6.50 per day. Students can use 
this to pay for their meals at 
specific dining locations, including 
Subway, Shake Smart and Papa 
John’s, among others. If a student 
purchases a meal that costs more 
than the Cash Exchange amount, 
the rest will be taken out of their Flex Bucks. 
The residential meal plans 
are two-semester commitments 
whereas commuter plans are paid 
for per semester. The Chomp 80 
is Gator Dining’s highest selling 
commuter plan, Tim Bucolo, the 
director of Gator Dining, wrote in 
an email. In addition, Chomp 50, 
Chomp 30, Chomp 65, Chomp 30 
and Declining Balance are other 
plans available for off-campus 
students. 
Chomp 65 and Chomp 30 
plans do not include Flex Bucks 
for students and only provide 
meal swipes for the dining hall. 
However, off-campus students 
still have the option to choose a 
residential meal plan. 
UF’s food service provider, 
Aramark, is not without 
controversy. In January, four 
organizations took a stand against 
the company to protest its use of 
prison labor through a boycott. 
Aramark has a history of wage 
and hour violations. UF denied the 
Food Justice Coalition’s request 
for a seat on the committee in 
May to negotiate the university’s 
next food provider. Victoria Bible, a 19-year-
old UF business administration 
sophomore, said she had the Gator 
Weekly 10 meal plan, which gave 
her 10 meals a week and $550 
in Flex Bucks per semester, her 
freshman year. 
“I’m really happy with the 
amount that I just got 10 swipes,” 
Bible said. “I wouldn’t have it any 
other way.” 
She loved that she didn’t have 
to cook or worry about grocery 
shopping, she said. Although she 
lived in Beaty Towers, which is 
an apartment-style residence hall 
with a kitchenette, she didn’t 
know how to cook, leading her 
to get a meal plan. Bible said 
she found the dining hall, which 
was less than a five-minute walk 
away, to be convenient. 
The dining hall food was hit 
or miss, Bible said. Each night, 
a few options were offered. 
Bible thought the pizza, chicken 
sandwiches, dessert and side 
items were delicious, she said. 
The plan she chose also allowed 
her to eat out and occasionally 
grocery shop. 
“I didn’t feel like I only had to 
eat at the dining hall,” she said. 
Bible used most of her Flex 
Bucks at the P.O.D. Market, she said. It offered not only snacks 
but also items like paper towels 
and laundry detergent, which 
she could use her Flex Bucks to 
purchase. She also frequented 
Starbucks and Chick-Fil-A. 
“I would use my Flex Bucks 
seven days a week whereas I’d 
only go to the dining hall maybe 
five days,” she said. 
At the end of the Spring 
semester, the Flex Bucks do not 
roll over, she said. 
“You got to be smart and really 
plan it out and spend all of them 
or as many as you can,” Bible 
said. 
Bible recommends the Gator 
Weekly 10 plan because it 
provides students with flexibility. 
Her friends who had the full 
access meal plan regretted it, she 
said, because they didn’t eat at the 
dining hall seven times a week. 
Compared to the most expensive 
plan, Gator Weekly 10 is about 
$535 cheaper per semester. 
Amanda Feijo, a 22-year-old 
UF economics and sustainability 
senior, never had a UF meal plan. 
Feijo said she made this decision 
not only because it seemed 
overpriced to her but also because 
she wanted to be independent by UF students discuss meal plan options

“I didn’t get a meal plan at any point during my college 
career, and I wouldn’t get it I don’t think,” she said. 
One advantage to not having a meal plan was she had 
more freedom to choose what she ate, Feijo said. It also 
meant she didn’t feel guilty about eating out. Feijo said she 
believes she wouldn’t have been as prepared to live in an 
apartment if she had a meal plan. 
“It was obviously a little bit challenging at first, but I 
think it led me to a comfortable place with cooking now,” 
she said. 
During her freshman year, Feijo said some days she’d 
cook and others she’d order food out. Feijo went to Aldi for 
groceries because it’s relatively cheap, she said. 
“I think overall it still ended up being cheaper than what 
the meal plan would have been, and I survived,” she said. 
However, there were nights where Feijo ate crackers for 
dinner and days where she didn’t feel like cooking so she 
spent money on a meal. The pros still outweigh the cons, 
she said. 
“Force yourself to cook,” she said. “It’s weird and 
maybe kind of hard at first but just do it and you’ll be 
thankful later.”

OUR STAFF COVERS HOW TO FIND 
YOUR FAMILIA ON AND OFF CAMPUS
By Isabella Barnet
Alligator Staff Writer
You won’t find the sweet smell of 
homemade arepas or abuelita’s arroz 
con frijoles in Gainesville as often as 
you would in your typical Hispanic 
household. For many new Latino Gators, 
finding your home away from home is 
even more difficult when you don’t have 
the proper guide on how to navigate 
a predominantly white institution in 
northern Florida. 
El Caimán has you covered on how to 
maneuver your way towards finding your 
familia on and off campus. 
Life is bland without a little sazón para tu corazón. Although local grocery 
chains like Publix offer an abundance of 
Hispanic supplies to recreate your family’s 
homemade recipes, you probably need 
something more authentic to get some 
extra spice — La Aurora, La Pasadita 
and La Tienda are close Hispanic owned 
stores that can satisfy your needs. 
Several local restaurants near UF like 
El Indio, Tinker and Mi Apa are easily 
accessible by bus or walking for a quick 
bite. If you’re willing to venture a little 
farther from campus, you’ll find hidden 
gems in the form of Cilantro Tacos, Latin 
Food Blessing and La Cocina de Abuela to 
bring you back to your roots. 
Your time at UF boils down to what 
you make of it, and your involvement 
plus friend groups heavily influence 
that. That’s why La Casita’s presence, advocated for by generations of former 
UF students, serves as a home for Latinos 
looking for their home away from home. 
Located alongside the Institute of 
Black Culture, La Casita is a safe space 
for any Gator looking for scholarship 
opportunities, private study spaces and 
the sweet smell of roasted Cuban coffee 
in and out of hallways. The colorful walls 
present an even more colorful history of 
activism, inclusivity and representation 
for our growing Hispanic community that 
you can learn about just by stepping foot 
at 1504 West University Avenue.
If you’re looking to get involved but 
aren’t sure where to start, the Institute 
of Hispanic Latino Affairs, the Hispanic 
Student Association and First Generation 
Leadership Program are just a few of 
dozens of Spanish-oriented organizations 
made to help you transition into UF. 
Beyond professional organizations 
are a multitude of welcoming groups that will make you feel more at home 
or put you in touch with however you 
culturally identify — from free Gator 
Salsa classes to hone in your Spanish 
spice, to the Multicultural Greek Council 
that offers 14 culturally-based fraternities 
and sororities, finding where you belong 
in UF’s Hispanic community is not as 
unattainable as you may think it is. 
It may seem daunting entering 
Gainesville as a Hispanic student, but 
generations of former Hispanic Gators 
paved the way to make UF a welcoming 
environment for future generations. 
They say home is not a place but rather 
a feeling. It is just a matter of feeling like 
you’ve found your forever familia in the 
home you make for yourself at UF. 
El Caimán hopes you can find your 
forever home as you start your journey as 
a Florida Gator.

COOPER BROWN, FAITH MANITI AND 
GIOVANNA MOMPREMIER WELCOME 
CLASS OF 2025 WITH INSIGHT ON 
STUDENT GOVERNMENT 
AND CAMPUS LIFE
By Carolina Ilvento
Alligator Staff Writer
Funded by student’s activities and services 
fees, Student Government is a campus 
organization that allows students to actively 
participate in the decision-making process 
within UF. Like the national government, 
SG is divided into three branches: executive, 
legislative and judicial.
“Our simple goal is to just enhance the 
everyday student experience,” Student Body 
President Cooper Brown said. “How can 
Student Government make the everyday life 
of every Gator just a little bit easier?”
Executive Branch
The executive branch is run by the elected 
Student Body president, vice president and 
treasurer, and features appointed officers 
who oversee cabinet and agency operations. 
There are four cabinet divisions — Diversity, 
Leadership & Service, Student Life and 
Transfer — overseen by the Student Body vice 
president, focused on yearly programming 
and working with student organizations to 
represent the Student Body. The executive 
branch also features 17 agencies, focused 
on specific issues ranging from promoting 
student safety to hosting speakers and 
promoting events. 
Legislative Branch
The legislative branch, the Student 
Senate, is made up of 100 elected senators 
— 50 representing colleges and school-years 
and 50 representing residence areas. Senate 
is responsible for approving a fiscal year 
budget of over $20 million, passing bills and 
resolutions and representing a constituency.Judicial Branch
The judicial branch is made up of the UF 
Supreme Court and the elections commission, 
which are run by UF law students. This 
branch is responsible for overseeing election 
procedures and judging university cases 
brought up by students.

Office Hours Tuesdays and Wednesdays 
11-4 PM
To welcome the Class of 2025, The Alligator 
talked to Brown, Maniti and Mompremier, 
who shared some of their experiences at UF.
What is your favorite library?
Giovanna Mompremier : In my early 
undergrad years, definitely Marston. I was 
in there frequently, switching between levels 
depending on what I was working on. But then 
when I got to the Health Science program, I 
used the Health Science Library more due to 
proximity with all my classes being there, and 
they also have really nice study rooms. 
A message to PaCE and Innovation Academy 
students
Cooper Brown : Don’t feel like you’re a 
Gator with an asterisk: use every opportunity 
that is at your fingertips. You’re no different 
than any other student.
What was it like living in a dorm as a Freshman?
Faith Maniti : You could just get up and 
walk 5-10 minutes to your meeting or an event 
and you’re there. There’s always something 
happening every single day of every single 
week, so it was never like a matter of what 
am I going to do today because there was 
always something there.
What is a piece of advice you have for incoming 
Freshmen?
Cooper Brown : Don’t overextend yourself: 
your identity is not in your resume. That’s 
what I always like to tell incoming freshmen, 
and that’s something that I wish I could have 
told myself as a freshman. Get involved in 
organizations because you care about the 
mission.
Faith Maniti : My advice would be not 
to focus too much on what everybody else 
around you is doing, or how everybody else around you is performing. You never know 
what kind of resources people are working 
with. That’s just the reality of life, people have 
different opportunities, and you shouldn’t 
beat yourself up for it.
What are some of your game day traditions?
Giovanna Mompremier : It’s crazy because 
on a game day, Gainesville is a whole different 
city; it just switches up. I was able to really 
just get that feeling, and just always know like 
if a game day is coming, oh, it’s just about to 
be different. 
What is something that every Gator has to 
experience?
Faith Maniti : You have to get a plate of 
Krishna at Plaza and just sit at Plaza and talk 
with your friends. And I know it’s so corny, 
but if you’re not tabling at Turlington, you 
at least have to experience peak Turlington 
hours, when everybody is giving out donuts 
or there’s music at any point of the day.  
Do you have some suggestions of Gainesville 
restaurants 
and coffee shops?
Cooper Brown : Gumby’s Pizza, Boca Fiesta, 
Peach Valley Cafe, Pascal’s Coffeehouse 
Giovanna Mompremier : Keke’s Breakfast 
Cafe, Muñecas Downtown Taco Garden, Halo 
Potato Donuts, Maude’s Coffee 
Faith Maniti : Curia on the Drag, If It Is 
Kitchen&Cafe, Social at Midtown, Tijuana 
Flats, Bo Diddley Plaza 
What is Student Government and how does it 
impact students?
Faith Maniti : A chunk of people’s tuition 
literally goes to fund us, and the work that 
we do. Whether you’re a part of Student 
Government, you’re working with Student 
Government or you’re at least paying attention 
to Student Government, there’s always a 
voice, or a hand, or something at stake in 
terms of whatever interests you might have.

GAINESVILLE IS KNOWN 
FOR ITS NICHE MUSIC 
SCENE. THESE STAPLE SPOTS 
KEEP IT ALIVE
By Brenna Sheets
Alligator Staff Writer
Whether a local young musician 
or an established national touring 
band, Gainesville’s music scene has 
a reputation for welcoming all kinds 
of artists with arms outstretched. 
The array of concerts and music 
festivals fundamental to the city’s 
culture, however, would be nonex -
istent if it weren’t for the music ven -
ues that host them.
Gainesville is home to several 
stages, but a select few have been 
especially crucial in carrying on the 
city’s legacy. For new and returning 
UF students coming to campus this 
Fall, the Gainesville concert experi -
ence would be incomplete without 
visiting  Heartwood Soundstage, 
Hardback Cafe, High Dive and The 
Wooly.
Heartwood Soundstage
Heartwood Soundstage opened 
Feb. 25, 2017, with the Heartwood 
Music Festival, a multi-stage, all-ages event featuring bands from all 
around the state of Florida. 
Since then, 17 Grammy-Award-
winning artists, such as John Paul 
White and Shaun Martin, have 
played at the venue, located at 619 
S. Main St. This year, Heartwood is 
broadening its focus from primarily 
local bands to more national touring 
bands, co-owner Dave Melosh said.
“Heartwood aspires to be a cen -
tral community gathering place for a 
wide variety of musical genres,” he 
said. “We are a music venue found -
ed by musicians, for musicians.”
Heartwood was built on the site 
of the old Mirror Image recording 
studio and though the venue still 
functions as a recording studio, it 
also hosts live performances. Heart -
wood expanded in 2017 to include 
an indoor acoustic stage with a ca -
pacity of 150 people and an outdoor 
stage that holds 1,500 people. 
Melosh and his partners hired 
Paul Pavelka, a former post-produc -
tion engineer for Warner Brothers, to 
design the interior soundstage. The 
finished design included a full audio 
and video setup, which the venue 
has used to record some of its live 
shows. Heartwood’s live video ses -
sions have brought in tens of thou -
sands of viewers from livestreams as well as over 670,000 total views on 
YouTube, according to Melosh.  
“One thing that makes us a little 
different from other venues is that 
we are an audio and video pro -
duction soundstage, so almost all 
of our shows are filmed and live-
streamed,” he said. “It’s the best 
sound room in Gainesville, hands 
down.” 
This year, Heartwood is planning 
for several different festivals and 
concerts. Highlights of this semes -
ter’s upcoming events include Heart -
wood’s annual Back To School Fest 
on Aug. 28, The Gainesville Reggae 
Festival on Sept. 25 and The Fest ‘19 
and the Tom Petty Music Festival in 
October. 
Hardback Cafe
Hardback Cafe’s history is a long 
and winding one, with the venue 
undergoing several evolutions since 
its opening in April 1989. 
Throughout the 1990s, the Hard -
back occupied the spaces now 
known as Boca Fiesta, The Backyard 
and Palomino Pool Hall. Concentrat -
ing on up-and-coming local acts, it 
hosted some of the early shows for 
bands like Less Than Jake and River 
Phoenix’s group Aleka’s Attic, ac -
cording to Gainesville Downtown. The venue closed in 1999, result -
ing in a 16-year hiatus. Owner Alan 
Bushnell reopened the Hardback on 
Dec. 11, 2015 on West University 
Avenue after “seeing a resurgence of 
local musicians who needed a place 
to play,” according to WUFT News.
In 2018, the Hardback moved to 
its current location at 920 NW Sec -
ond St. Since its move, the venue has 
served as a performance space as 
well as a drive-thru market known 
as Undertown, selling milk, eggs, 
cigarettes, coffee and cans of beer.
From special screenings of Tom 
Miller’s The Seven Sides of Shake -
speare to performances by local 
crust punk and sludge metal hybrid 
acts like Baptized in Piss, the Hard -
back’s collection of nightlife events 
is truly one of a kind. 
“Hardback Cafe is primarily a 
venue for new performance art,” 
according to the venue’s website.  
“Shows can involve videos, projec -
tions, live painting, theatre, rock 
bands, hip hop. Anything goes at the 
Hardback.”
High Dive
Hosting between 200 to 250 
events a year, High Dive has become 
one of the most prominent venues 
in Gainesville, reputable for being a 
space concert-goers would expect to 
find only in a larger city. 
“Seeing a live show with your 
friends, loved ones and hundreds 
of strangers is a visceral shared mo -
ment that can only be experienced 
in-person to be appreciated,” Pat 
Lavery, High Dive’s facility and 
events manager, wrote in an email. 
“At High Dive, we like to think we 
provide one of the best venues in the 
area to do this.”
The site, located at 210 SW Sec -
ond Ave, is the former home of 
Common Grounds and Covered 
Dish. Today, the building is shared 
between High Dive and Five Star 
Pizza. Dating back to the ‘90s, High 
Dive’s location has seen influential 
bands such as Dave Matthews Band, 
Green Day, Nine Inch Nails, Black 
Keys, Paramore and more come to 
the stage, as well as comedians like 
Eric Andre and Patton Oswalt. 
“High Dive is the epicenter and 
the soul of Gainesville’s live music 
scene,” Lavery said. “We routinely 
bring well-known, national touring 
artists of all kinds to Gainesville in 
a laid back, yet professional environ -
ment.”
High Dive officially opened under 
its current name in July 2011, mak -
ing this year its 10-year anniversary. 
The venue has one of its busiest 
Fall schedules yet, according to Lav -
ery. Some upcoming shows include 
performances by flipturn, Mayday 
Parade, Hobo Johnson, Chris Renze -
ma, The Hails, Beach Fossils and co -
median Ginger Billy. High Dive will also host the Original Gainesville 
Food Truck Rally and  live perfor -
mances of the Rocky Horror Picture 
Show, along with many other events 
traditional to the venue, in the com -
ing months. 
The Wooly
Located at 20 N. Main St, The 
Wooly first opened its doors in 2013 
as a venue for The Fest, a yearly 
punk music festival in Gainesville 
that draws in tens of thousands of 
attendees annually. The Wooly is a 
4,400-square-foot indoor venue that 
garnered a following from its past 
performances from acts like Kissis -
sippi, Mom Jeans and The Casual -
ties.
The Wooly is best-known for its 
nostalgic Pop Punk & Emo Nights, 
which take place on the last Satur -
day of the month. The Pop Punk 
& Emo Nights feature DJs and live 
performers who play songs by artists 
like Paramore, Taking Back Sunday, 
Fall Out Boy, Sleeping With Sirens, 
Blink-182, My Chemical Romance, 
Panic! At the Disco and A Day To 
Remember.
In addition to its live-music 
events, the venue hosts film screen -
ings for cult classics like The Big 
Lebowski, “beer dinners” with lo -
cal brewing companies and themed 
public game nights. One of The 
Wooly’s most recent events, July 
16’s “X-Brides Club,” was tailored to 
brides, bridesmaids and divorcees.
The Wooly is part of Top Secret 
Events, a group of unique venue 
spaces in Downtown Gainesville. 
Top Secret Events facilitates book -
ings for wedding receptions, holi -
day and cocktail parties, and other 
private events at The Wooly, The 
Depot Event Space and The Boxcar 
Bar.

TRANSFER AND PACE 
STUDENTS SHARE THEIR 
EXPERIENCES AND GIVE 
ADVICE FOR 
INCOMING STUDENTS
By Camila Pereira
Alligator Staff Writer
The start of a new school year 
marks the first day on campus 
for not only freshmen, but also 
transfer, Innovation Academy 
and Pathway to Campus Enroll -
ment students getting settled in 
the Swamp.
Although the transition can be 
nerve-racking, all UF students — 
whether admitted traditionally or 
non-traditionally — are an essen -
tial part of the Gator nation and 
encouraged to take every opportu -
nity to succeed in the university.
“They are as much of a student as anyone else on this campus,” 
Cooper Brown, UF’s student body 
president, said.
Brown completed most of his 
undergraduate degree online as 
a UF PaCE student and said stu -
dents should immerse themselves 
in campus life in any way they 
can and take advantage of all the 
opportunities the university has 
to offer.
“I always like to tell students, 
you know, PaCE and (Innova -
tion Academy) students and even 
transfer students, is that it’s not 
a barrier,” the 23-year-old gradu -
ate student said. “You can still get 
involved in whatever you want to 
get involved in.”
As the first former UF PaCE 
student to serve as student body 
president, Brown urges students 
to get connected as UF students 
come from all over the world and 
getting to know one another will allow them to grow individually.
“The Gator nation is huge, I 
mean, it’s worldwide, and your 
time here whether that be two or 
three years as a transfer student 
or four years, or however longer 
as a PaCE or innovation student, 
just really enjoy your time, get 
connected and meet people,” he 
said.
UF Online will host a Fall 2021 
Welcome Week for incoming and 
returning students to learn more 
about the UF Online experience 
and meet their online peers.
Beyond online schooling, UF 
has welcomed thousands of trans -
fer students from all around the 
country. In 2019, over 2,000 stu -
dents transferred to UF.
UF alumnus Ivey Sapp said 
transferring was nerve-racking at 
first as she came from Cross City, 
a small town in Dixie County, 
Florida.“At first it was like a culture 
shock because you don’t know 
anyone, you’re at this big cam -
pus, you’re kind of overwhelmed 
with everything that college life is 
throwing at you, but as I went on 
in my first semester as a transfer 
student, things got easier,” the 
23-year-old said.
Sapp transferred to UF from 
Florida Gateway College in Fall 
2017 into the Unified Elementary 
ProTeach program at the UF Col -
lege of Education. 
Through the program, she had 
the opportunity to create a net -
work with not only friends who 
she took with her after college, 
but also professors and teaching 
assistants who enhanced her pro -
fessional aspirations.
“If you find your friend group 
there and you find people that you 
feel a connection to, you’ll fit in 
faster than you think,” Sapp said.Alexis Galindo, a UF econom -
ics senior, also recommended in -
coming transfer students to take 
advantage of getting involved on 
campus.
“If you have the opportunity to 
do so, do it because that’s what I 
regret the most,” the 21-year-old 
said.
Galindo transferred to UF in 
Fall 2020 and said he struggled 
to get involved and make friends 
during his first year as classes 
went online due to COVID-19.
However, as the university 
pushes for in-person classes this 
Fall, he said he is excited to see 
what campus life is like at UF.
“For the first time, as a senior, 
I’ll be actually experiencing the 
full college life at UF,” Galindo 
said. “And, I don’t know, I think 
that’s always crazy to think 
about.”

SENIORS REMINISCE AS THEY 
SHARE STORIES OF THEIR FAVORITE 
FRESHMAN MEMORIES AT UF
By Isabella Douglas
Alligator Staff Writer
With the “Gator” title comes the pride 
of wearing signature orange and blue at 
football games, the freedom to choose 
when to wake up for class and a legacy 
spanning 168 years. 
Freshmen, welcome to The Swamp.
On Aug. 23, classes will begin at UF 
with freshmen scrambling to figure out the 
bus system and seniors heading to their 
favorite coffee shops before their first lec -
ture. Heading into the new school year, some UF seniors offered advice to fresh -
men unsure of what to expect with college 
life.
With over 35,000 undergraduates at UF, 
the campus has connected and facilitated 
a network of long-lasting friendships. 
One of the best things about being a 
freshman was the unpredictability, Nich -
olas Garas, a 21-year-old finance senior, 
said. 
“When you’re a freshman sometimes 
you find yourself in weird places or ran -
dom places especially because you don’t 
know your way around the school,” he 
said. “Whether you’re trying to find a 
classroom or whether you’re out one night 
walking around with somebody that you 
know you never would have talked to.”
With constantly teetering between at -tending classes, going to work and main -
taining a social life, seniors like Garas be -
lieve it made the freshman experience far 
more valuable.  
He remembers walking back to Infinity 
Hall his freshman year and randomly join -
ing paths with Shaan Patel, a 21-year-old 
finance senior. 
“We started talking, like we’re cracking 
jokes at each other and like hanging out. 
After that we started hanging out a ton,” 
Garas said. “And that guy now is going to 
be my senior year roommate, and he’s one 
of my best friends.”
Patel suggested freshmen start social -
izing early on in their first year. 
“I definitely think the biggest thing that 
people should focus on when they come 
to UF, especially because everyone is to -
tally open to it, is just like making as many 
friends as you can as quickly as possible,” 
Patel said.
Looking around his Introduction to 
Business class, also known as Warrington 
Welcome, Garas wished he had said hi to 
one of the 20 other freshmen in the class. 
“Convincing yourself that you’re not 
the only one in this new place, in this new 
situation is something that I wish I had 
wrapped my mind around earlier,” Garas 
said. 
As a freshman, Garas was involved in 
UF’s soccer club and exploring financial 
economics, a finance club where he cre -
ated positive relationships with his peers. 
He said getting involved in a variety of in -
terest groups is one of the best things one 
can do when starting as a freshman.
“Apart from college being a big step in 
your scholastic career, it’s also a big part 
of your social development,” Garas said. 
“I think it’s really important to meet peo -
ple and get just kind of acclimated in a 
new setting.”
One of the classes Patel took outside of 
his major was Wildlife Issues with Mike 
Moulton. Known as an easy class, he said, 
Patel found the course interesting and at -
tended office hours to learn more. 
At UF, he said he overstressed academ -
ics as a freshman.
“You think that every exam is like the 
end of the world if you don’t do well, but a 
lot of the classes are designed to teach you what you don’t already know,” Patel said.
Safely concealed in her apartment in 
Gainesville, Jessica Schaechter thinks 
fondly of a journal tucked away in her 
room with pages full of her favorite mem -
ories from freshman year.
Now a senior, she reminisces on her 
first year of college, while heading into her 
last year as an undergraduate. 
“It’s the little things,” the 20-year-old 
economics and telecommunications senior 
said. “It goes by so fast, so you know, get 
a hold of all those opportunities and really 
enjoy them to the maximum.”
One of the best things about being a 
college freshman is the independence, 
Schaechter said. This new independence, 
she said, comes with the freedom to ex -
plore who you are and where you want to 
take yourself in life. 
“For my parents it was a little bit hard 
to kind of let me go and explore my own 
life and my independence,” she said. “But 
that’s definitely what I treasure the most 
looking back all these years.”
Schaechter was an exploratory major 
her freshman year of college. Unsure of 
what she wanted to major in, she took the 
advice of friends, professors and advisors 
and completed a wide range of classes that 
interested her.
First-year students may declare explor -
atory as their major for their first three se -
mesters. In the first two years as a UF stu -
dent, 61% of the student body switched 
their major. 
Schaechter’s family lives in Costa Rica, 
so whenever she feels lonely she reaches 
out to UF’s international community. 
“I think that the international commu -
nity in UF is also very strong and very sup -
portive in the sense that you know you 
always have your other family or your 
friends to keep you company or invite you 
to Thanksgiving if you have nothing else 
to do or no one else to be with.” 
Laughing, Schaechter shared one last 
piece of advice to any incoming freshman 
living in the city.
“Always carry an umbrella in 
Gainesville,” she said.

was amazing. I felt like I met a celebrity,” Tellez said. “It’s my first year on campus and I’m 
super excited and it’s just like the cherry on top.”

THE SMATHERS LIBRARIES FORM THE 
LARGEST INFORMATION RESOURCE 
SYSTEM IN FLORIDA
By Makiya Seminera 
Alligator Staff Writer 
During a typical year at UF, the bustle of 
campus life is hard to miss — with students 
racing to class, hurrying to catch a bus, or 
weaving their way through Plaza of the 
Americas to grab Krishna lunch. Amid the 
flurry of students, the six George A. Smathers 
libraries provide an escape for both students 
and faculty alike to seek refuge.
“There are times when there’s just too 
many distractions in your living environment,” 
University Libraries Dean Judith Russell said.  
“We think the libraries are a place that give the 
students (another) option. And there’s so many 
options, many different locations, different 
libraries with different characteristics.”
Consisting of six different libraries — 
Architecture and Fine Arts Library, Education 
Library, Health Science Center Libraries, Library 
West, Marston Science Library and Smathers 
Library —  The George A. Smathers libraries 
form the largest information resource system 
in Florida. The Levin College of Law’s Legal 
Information Center also holds a collaborative 
relationship with Smathers libraries. 
Library visitors have access to a growing 
collection of 6.17 million print volumes, in 
addition to more than 62,000 UF dissertations 
and theses. If guests don’t have time to visit 
one of the six libraries, they can access 1.5 
million e-books and over 14 million digitized 
pages by navigating the Smathers libraries’ 
website. 
Like all other areas on campus during 
the COVID-19 pandemic, the Smathers 
libraries were forced to drastically adjust 
their procedures. To ensure safety within 
the libraries — which collectively attract 4.5 
million visitors annually — seating capacities 
were reduced, face coverings were required 
and Gator 1 ID cards were mandatory upon 
entry to check if students were cleared for 
campus. 
“I was dreading the idea that people would 
show up and want to come into the library, 
and we’d have to say there’s no room,” Russell 
said. 
Services such as Ask-A Librarian — a free 
library service that allows students to seek 
assistance from library staff through email, 
text, or instant message  — flourished during 
the pandemic when many students found 
themselves no longer on campus. Now, as 
campus facilities will open at full capacity 
during Summer B and masks are now optional, 
the six branches of the Smathers libraries look 
to fully resume their unique services to their 
patrons. 
Library West
After whirling through the revolving 
entrance doors and grabbing coffee from 
Starbucks, patrons of Library West hurry up 
the escalator to find a peaceful seat to study. 
Serving as the centerpiece of Plaza of the 
Americas, Library West remains one of the 
most popular libraries on campus. 
With seating for approximately 1,400 
visitors and an official “quiet study” space on 
the fourth floor, Library West is designed to 
withstand the rush of students who may flood 
the building during final exams week. Students 
can choose to sit at the various tables, chairs, 
study rooms, or FitDesk study bikes located 
throughout the building. 
Designated as the humanities and social 
sciences library, students have access to 
collections from various fields: books, 
microform materials, newspapers, periodicals, 
journals and DVDs. 
In addition to the 18 group study rooms at 
Library West, students can use unique spaces like the One Button Video Recording Studio — 
a recording studio equipped with HD cameras, 
lighting, audio equipment and a green screen 
function. Another space in Library West, the 
Accessibility Studio, is available for registered 
Disability Resource Center students to have a 
private space to interact with library resources. 
The library staff aims to make Library 
West a more inclusive space for visitors of all 
backgrounds, according to Library West chair 
Stacey Ewing. Like other library branches, a 
lactation room and gender-neutral bathrooms 
were added in Library West. As a way to further 
accommodate students during the pandemic, 
Library West added 10 test proctoring booths 
for students who did not have a quiet area at 
home to take an exam. 
Library East (Smathers)
At first glance, Library East appears to be 
a modest building, as it blends in with the 
surrounding lecture halls. However, one step 
inside reveals that the library is filled to the 
brim with historical treasures.
Dating back to 1925, Library East is the 
oldest library on campus with an original 
capacity of 800. In nearly 100 years, Library 
East’s four floors have become home to 
remarkable collections, including the Map and 
Imagery Library, Isser and Rae Price Library of 
Judaica, and the Latin American and Caribbean 
Collections.
Located on the first floor, the Map & 
Imagery Library is one of the largest academic 
map libraries in the country, containing around 
500,000 maps, 300,000 aerial photographs and 
8,000 reference books and atlases. 
On the second floor, students can enter the 
Grand Reading room to be assigned a table to 
access non-circulating materials. The Judaica 
Suite, attached to the Grand Reading Room, is 
filled with rare books from the Isser and Rae 
Price Library of Judaica. In addition to the 
priceless books found in the Judaica Suite, 
students can observe the handmade artwork 
of Kenneth Treister, the architect of the room. 
One of Library East’s most distinguished 
collections, the Latin American and Caribbean 
Collection, was founded in 1951 and is 
currently located on the third floor of Library 
East. The collection contains around 500,000 
volumes in English, Spanish, Portuguese, and 
various indigenous languages. The collection 
also serves as a way for many Latinx students 
to connect with their culture, LACC public 
services associate Keith Manuel said.
Although the COVID-19 pandemic reduced 
Library East’s capacity and hours, it provided 
a unique advantage: increasing and improving 
its digital collections. As fewer students were 
able to access physical prints of literature, 
library staff were tasked with scanning and 
photographing the collections so students 
could find what they needed online.
 
Marston Science Library
Sitting right beside the Hub and Turlington 
Plaza, Marston Science Library sits in a 
convenient spot on campus and garners a 
substantial amount of foot traffic. With the 
yellow gangling Alachua sculpture — lovingly 
known as the French fries — located right 
outside the building, Marston is hard to miss. 
Named after the seventh UF president 
Robert Q. Marston, Marston Science Library 
caters to the university’s scientific community. 
The library was built in 1987 to consolidate 
the six original UF science branch libraries: 
Agriculture, Physics, Botany, Engineering, 
Chemistry and Biology-Geology. 
Students can choose which of the five floors 
best fit their studying needs, with the bottom 
three floors being designated for group study 
and the top two floors for quiet study.
Marston Science Library remains a 
technological pioneer among the other 
Smathers libraries. In addition to maintaining 
five computer labs within the building — 
with one of them specialized for augmented reality development — Marston offers a multi-
purpose visualization and conference room 
for students to reserve for meetings, Marston 
Science Library chair Valrie Minson said.
Not only does Marston offer an abundance 
of technology, but their expanding tool 
library allows students to loan out take-home 
equipment ranging from drill sets to sewing 
machines. 
Architecture and Fine Arts Library
With a growing collection of 125,000 
volumes, the academic needs of students 
from both the College of Design, Construction 
& Planning and the College of the Arts are 
satisfied by the Architecture and Fine Arts 
Library. Since its opening in 1965, the AFA 
library has emerged as one of the largest art 
library collections in the southeastern United 
States. 
Unlike its neighbor Marston Science 
Library, the AFA library discourages extended 
group study sessions due to the vast open 
space of the library. Instead, individual study 
is enhanced through the use of the famous 
double-decker carrel units equipped with 
electrical outlets, which are found throughout 
the reading room. 
Through the AFA library, comprehensive 
research guides were also created for students 
pursuing different disciplines supported by the 
library. The guides include a variety of topics 
within the arts and architecture professions 
including ceramics, dance, construction 
management, interior design and sustainability. 
Education Library
Opened in 1980, the Education Library is 
home to over 80,000 textbooks, children’s and 
young adult books, and journals. Right outside 
its doors, a beloved oak tree — winner of the 
2021 UF Library Landmark Lollapalooza — 
stands tall to be admired by the library staff 
and students alike.
Separated from the main campus by 
Norman Field, the Education Library remains 
hidden from a large part of the UF population. 
However, its proximity to Sorority Row and 
other off-campus housing makes it a prime 
spot for some students to resume their studies 
close to home, Rachael Elrod, head of the 
Education Library, said.  
Although the library supplies print materials 
meant to support programs within the College 
of Education, the expansion of educational 
technology is on the rise within the Education 
Library — specifically within the EduGator 
Makery.
The EduGator Makery is a space within 
the Education Library that holds traditional 
educational technologies such as die cuts, a 
laminator and video editing software. 
To Elrod, the Education Library offers an 
alternative for students who want to get away 
from the fast pace of UF’s campus. 
“I think there’s just this feeling of 
community,” Elrod said. “It tends to be a very 
quiet library as opposed to Library West or 
Marston where there’s lots of activity...there’s 
nothing wrong with that, but people seeking 
out a quiet environment in the library would 
really find a home here.”
Health Science Center Libraries
Unlike the other library branches, the 
Health Science Center Libraries have two 
locations: Gainesville and Jacksonville. 
The Borland Health Sciences Library seeks 
to support patrons at UF Health in Jacksonville 
by providing health resources and research to 
doctors.
The main Health Science Center library 
in Gainesville serves over 11,000 students, 
faculty and staff from the six Health Science 
Center UF colleges. HSC libraries also serve 
Shands Health Care by supporting its clinical 
and research missions through its exceptional 
health collections.The HSC library played a critical role in 
community mitigation of COVID-19 through 
the creation of a COVID-19 library guide with 
resources for healthcare practitioners and the 
public, according to nursing and consumer 
health liaison Maggie Ansell. The library 
guide was helpful to many members of the 
local community who were unsure of how 
to navigate the emerging COVID-19 health 
information.
Improving mental health is another mission 
of the HSC library — whether it be through 
providing jigsaw puzzles and coloring kits for 
students to distract themselves, offering nap 
pods for students to relax in, or inviting local 
therapy dogs throughout the semester.
Two local therapy dogs, Beau and Lentil 
Bean, as well as their owners Terry Biehl and 
Elizabeth Pearlman, are frequent visitors to 
the HSC library, stopping by a couple times a 
semester to greet students. 
“[Beau] loves visiting students, I would 
have to say of all the therapy work, it’s his 
favorite,” Biehl said.
In order to abide by CDC guidelines, Beau 
and Lentil Bean’s visits were moved outside 
of the HSC library. Guests were instructed to 
maintain social distancing, wear masks, and 
wash their hands before and after petting the 
dogs. 
The student debate:  which library is the best?
Although each of the six branches 
collaborate with one another to put on 
Smathers library-wide events like the annual 
fall festival, they also enjoy participating 
in healthy competition — mostly brought 
about by UF students who have pledged their 
allegiance to one of the libraries.
Choosing a favorite UF library can be 
determined by numerous factors: location, the 
collections offered, seating arrangements, or 
even the presence of a Starbucks inside. For 
Gabby Whitler, 21-year-old psychology senior, 
the ornate aesthetics of Library East secured its 
location as her regular study spot.
“The ambience of [Library East] is just 
really nice and helps me focus,” Whitler said. 
“It almost helps me fantasize [that] I enjoy 
studying and manifest that mindset.”
Other students like 20-year-old accounting 
junior Kate Ross found comfort in studying at 
Library West, even if it meant taking a detour 
from her normal path on campus. 
“Overall, I find the furniture and overall 
appearance in Llibrary Wwest to be very 
appealing both to sit in and look at,”  Ross 
said. “Library West is further than a lot of the 
dorms on campus, but it is definitely worth the 
extra walk.”
Melanie Halem, a 20-year-old political 
science and mathematics senior, said Marston’s 
top floors are the perfect place to focus on 
schoolwork. 
“I think the fifth floor cubbies are just 
perfect,” Halem said. “There’s a cubby with 
plants around it that is so beautiful. It has such 
a great view of Beaty Towers too.”
Haley Geer, 20-year-old animal science 
junior, also identified Marston as her favorite 
library at UF, as she felt that the library 
contained various collections and equipment 
that catered to her field of study.
“It works really well for STEM students, 
which I know is the purpose of it, but I always 
found it very accessible,” Geer said.
For Craft Talbot, a 21-year-old business 
management senior, Marston Science Library 
is more than just a favorite study spot. In 
February, Talbot adopted a bunny from 
Gainesville Rabbit Rescue and named him 
after her favorite spot on campus — Marston.
“I can’t wait [for] my senior year,” Talbot 
said. “I’m definitely going to take graduation 
pictures in front of [Marston Science Library] 
with Marston.”

HEALTH & WELLNESSTHE OLDEST STUDENT 
FITNESS CENTER ON 
CAMPUS CAN BE FOUND IN 
THE SHADOW OF BEN HILL 
GRIFFIN STADIUM
By Joseph Henry
Sports Writer
Nestled right in the heart of UF’s 
campus, the Student Recreation & 
Fitness Center is the university’s 
original gym. 
Opened in 1991, Student Rec 
is over 37,000-square-feet and is 
located next to the Student Health 
Care Center and behind the Racquet 
Club Dining Center on Fletcher 
Drive. 
Student Rec’s strength and 
conditioning room spans 6,300 
square feet. Three large activity 
rooms host guided classes like yoga 
and zumba, and a dedicated cardio 
room and a cycling studio provide 
opportunities to get your blood 
pumping. 
The facility is centered around a 
multipurpose gymnasium that can be used for basketball, volleyball and 
even martial arts. Five racquetball 
courts and two squash courts are 
also housed inside. Sports equipment 
is available for checkout at the gym’s 
front desk. 
On a day where the Gainesville 
heat is especially overbearing, you 
can take a dip in the Florida Pool, 
located directly behind Student Rec. 
The pool features eight 50-yard-long 
swimming lanes with depths ranging 
from 4.5 feet to 12.5 feet. It’s also 
heated up to a toasty 84 degrees in 
the winter months. 
The gym, pool and equipment 
rentals are free to all UF students 
who are taking classes. 
While smaller in size than the 
massive Southwest Recreation 
Center, Student Rec’s main upside 
is its convenient location. Parking 
at Student Rec is scarce though, and 
the facility is best accessed by bike, 
scooter or foot. With the majority 
of UF’s residence halls on the east 
side of campus, they are not walking 
distance to the state-of-the-art 
Southwest Rec. So, if you are trying 
to get a sweat in with only a small amount of time between classes, 
Student Rec is for you. 
Lance Duch, a 20-year-old 
microbiology junior, fits trips to 
Student Rec into his schedule almost 
every day. 
“I typically went around 11 a.m. 
or noon each day and loved going at 
the time because the gym wasn’t too 
busy but also not dead either,” said 
Duch.
Duch wanted to build muscle 
when he came to college, so he 
has spent most of his time in the 
weight room, which he said has all 
the machines and weights he needs. 
He said the location was his favorite 
aspect of Student Rec because he 
never had to drive to go to the gym.  
The classic recreation center lacks 
the size and style of its counterpart, 
but it overcomes that with its 
convenience. If you stop by for a 
work out, make sure you don’t skip 
out on the free Gatorade offered in 
the lobby of the Student Health Care 
Center.

A LOOK INSIDE
 UF’S LARGEST GYM
By Michael Hull
Sports Writer
Look, I get it. Southwest Recreation Cen -
ter can be intimidating to the average gym-
goer. The 140,000-square-foot facility looks 
like something out of a utopian sci-fi film. 
I’m here to make you feel comfortable in 
UF’s premiere workout environment. Let’s 
get started.The indoor section of UF’s largest gym 
boasts six indoor basketball courts, five rac -
quetball courts and a multipurpose gym for 
sports like indoor soccer. Students play pick-
up basketball on the courts, which is a great 
way to get cardio in without feeling like you 
want to die inside.
Southwest Rec is available for all UF stu -
dents who are enrolled in classes and paid 
the Activity and Service Fee. Christian Lopez, 
a 20-year-old international studies junior, 
worked out at Southwest for about five days 
a week this summer. Lopez said he mostly 
uses the weight room and basketball courts.
“I love doing strength training and hoop -
ing,” Lopez said. “Physical activity is super 
fun and good for your mental and physical 
health.”
The center offers much more than bas -
ketball. There’s a 15,000-square-foot cardio 
room that spans two levels. The first level 
features exercise machines like treadmills, 
elliptical machines and exercise bikes, as 
well as an open area with free weights, ket -
tlebells and medicine balls. I enjoy this area, 
especially since they added squat racks and 
benches to it. It’s typically less crowded than 
the weight room, and there’s more room to 
do full exercise circuits. The downside is 
it can fill up quickly. There are only a few 
squat racks and a couple benches, so this is 
more of an area for body-weight exercises 
than anything else in my opinion.
Head upstairs, and you’ll find my favorite 
spot in the entire center. The upstairs car -dio area features an indoor 1/9th mile track, 
more machines and free weights. Now, I am 
by no means a runner, so the track is not for 
me. However, this area is typically the quiet -
est and is the best spot to do body-weight ex -
ercises. It also includes a rack of dumbbells 
and kettlebells, so there is plenty to work 
with in a calm area of the gym. 
Back downstairs, the facility houses a 
large weight room that holds both free weight 
activities like squat racks and bench presses, 
as well as leg presses and chest presses. This 
is where you’ll find the true gym hardos (if 
you’ve been in a gym, you know the type), 
featuring fraternity formal tank tops, Gym -
shark leggings and plenty of preworkout 
to go around. While it does have the most 
equipment, the weight room can be intimi -
dating to new gym members. I’d recommend 
going with a friend at first, then ease yourself 
into the weight room life.
Southwest offers the ability to workout 
out on your own or with others. It hosts 
classes taught by trained fitness profession -
als, like cycling, zumba, hip hop fitness and 
yoga classes. 
The complex also features an outdoor sec -
tion that includes beach volleyball and tennis 
courts, as well as fields for intramural sports. 
Students can rent equipment from South -
west to use on the courts or fields, such as 
Frisbees, tennis rackets and footballs.
Despite all the amenities offered, RecS -
ports still looks for ways to improve the fa -
cility. This past Spring, it had gym-goers fill out a survey for ways to better the center. 
Lopez wishes there were more squat racks 
and Olympic lifting areas inside of the weight 
room. Personally, I just want the ShakeSmart 
located inside Southwest to be open 24/7, 
but I’m a dreamer.
Put at the edge of UF’s campus near Lake -
side Complex, students who live on campus 
normally take the bus or drive to Southwest 
Rec instead of walking. However, the size 
and amenities of Southwest are worth the 
extra commute. The biggest issue with the 
distance is parking. Students need a UF decal 
to park by Southwest until 3:30 p.m. Any de -
cal can be used, though, making it accessible 
to off-campus residents with a Park-and-Ride 
decal.
Now, the most important part of any 
Southwest experience: timing. Working out 
at the wrong time can ruin your gym experi -
ence. Lopez recommends not going between 
4 p.m. and 7 p.m. I recommend finding a time 
in the morning to go. If that doesn’t work, 
either lunch time or late at night is the way 
to go. You can always check UF’s RecSports 
app — available on both iOS and android — 
for time updates. The app features cameras 
and head counts, showing how many people 
are in each section of the gym at a time.
Hopefully now, with the help of this 
guide, you can walk into Southwest Rec con -
fidently.
