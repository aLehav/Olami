� FINANCIAL AID WILL NOT BE AFFECTED MUCH.
MOISES REYES
Alligator Contributing Writer
After a year of heated debate, the U.S. Senate failed to 
pass both Democratic and Republican proposals to avoid au-
tomatic, across-the-board spending cuts Thursday afternoon. As a result, the $85 billion cuts, known as the sequester, took effect at midnight.  
Although the sequester is not supposed to affect military 
pay or social safety-net programs such as Medicare and So-cial Security, major concerns loom over its impact on eco-nomic growth.
UF students won’t feel the effects of the spending cuts on 
their ﬁ  nancial aid.
Rick Wilder, director of UF Student Financial Affairs, said 
any effect the sequester will have on student ﬁ  nancial aid will be mild and won’t occur until the 2013-2014 academic year.
“Financial aid programs here at the university have been 
very stable for decades,” he said.
The cuts, however, will have a negative impact on re-
search at universities.Sequestration

Gainesville Police arrested two UF stu-
dents early Thursday morning after they 
were seen tampering with a vehicle.
Police charged Thibault de Vernejoul, 18, 
of 1116 SW 14th Ave., and Laurence Kidd, 20, of 1044 SW 14th Ave., with attempted bur-glary, a third-degree felony, according to a GPD arrest report.The report gave the following account: At about 3 a.m. Thursday, a man called 
police and said he saw two men in the 1000 block of Southwest Second Place pulling on his car door handle.
When police arrived, ofﬁ  cers found Verne-
joul and Kidd leaving the area.
The caller identiﬁ  ed Vernejoul and Kidd as 
the men he saw trying to break into his car.
Kidd told ofﬁ  cers he tried about 20 car door handles and his cell-phone was stolen. He said he thought he might ﬁ  nd it in one of the cars.
Vernejoul told police 
Kidd lost his cellphone. He 
added that Kidd was de-termined to steal a replace-ment phone or enough 
money to purchase a new one.GPD spokesman Ofﬁ  cer Ben Tobias said 
ofﬁ  cers searched Vernejoul and Kidd’s apart-ments at Oakbrook Walk Residences for sto-len items but didn’t ﬁ  nd anything.
Police booked Vernejoul and Kidd into the 
Alachua County Jail at about 5 a.m, according to the report. They were released later Thurs-day.

� BUS SERVICE WILL BE 
LIMITED UNTIL MARCH 10.

Students planning to stick around 
Gainesville during Spring Break will 
have to plan ahead if they intend to ride the bus.From Saturday to March 10, Re-
gional Transit Service will run on its reduced service schedule, which includes suspending some of its routes, according to an RTS press release.
City routes 1, 9, 10, 12, 13, 16, 17, 
20, 23, 34, 35, 36 and 43 will run less often during the week.
Later Gator, campus service and 
city routes 21, 22, 27, 28, 29, 38, 39, 46, 62 and 76 will not run during the break.
“Since ridership reduces during 
the break and some of our service is funded by UF and Santa Fe, they don’t want to pay when most stu-dents are out of town,” said Chip Skinner, RTS marketing and com-munications supervisor.
Some students may be affected 
by this temporary schedule.Alex Lum, an 18-year-old UF 
statistics freshman, said he plans to spend the majority of the break in Gainesville. Lum said besides going to work, he’ll be studying.
“I don’t think I’ll be bothered by 
how little the bus is running,” he said.
The remainder of city routes 2, 
5, 6, 7, 8, 11,15, 24, 25 and 75 will continue to run on their normal schedule. Paratransit service won’t be affected either. RTS will resume its normal schedule when students return to class March 11.

� FEWER ADULTS ARE 
BUYING HOMES AND CARS.
KATIE BURNS
Alligator Contributing Writer
Alex Zins will graduate this 
spring and enter the workforce. But 
it will be a while before the 22-year-old starts thinking about buying any expensive items, for fear of falling into debt.
Zins is not alone in being afraid 
of debt, according to a new study from the Pew Research Center. It shows fewer adults younger than 35 are buying homes, owning cars and incurring credit card debt.
“We’re used to thinking about 
this that way by now,” said Zins, a UF information systems and opera-tions management senior. “When we were looking at colleges, we had to think about the recession and how it would affect our decision.”
That’s no surprise to UF micro-economics professor Mark Rush, who is investigating factors that cause fluctuations in economic ac-tivity . 
He said avoiding situations that 
could produce debt is common dur -
ing a recession.
“Students are leaving college with 
more college debt, which is making them a little wary about taking addi-tional debt for a home or car because they are concerned about paying off student loans,” Rush said.
The study showed the share of 
younger households in debt was 78 percent — the lowest since the gov-ernment began gathering the data.
“Watching the media portray 
the recession made debt seem like a real thing,” Zins said. “We just had a head start versus students 10 years ago.”

The Nightlife Navigators and officers from 
Gainesville Police gathered on the North 
Lawn on Thursday to educate students about how to stay safe during Spring Break.
Emily Zeilberger, a representative for 
Nightlife Navigators, said the organization asked police to talk about drugs, alcohol and safety tips.
“It’s important because there’s only so 
much we can tell other students,” she said. “It’s a stronger impact when police come to talk.”
Zeilberger, an 18-year-old UF geomatics 
freshman, said she asked passers-by to sign a petition for the Student Nighttime Auxiliary Patrol to extend its driving perimeter by a block. She said they have about 2,000 signa-tures supporting SNAP’s expansion.
GPD Officer Nicole Tierney said she spoke 
to about 50 students during Wednesday and Thursday’s events.
Tierney said there are many ways students 
can stay safe during the holiday.
“A big thing people tend to forget is not 
to broadcast on social media where you are going,” she said. “Don’t put out so much in-formation.”
Tierney also said students should pack 
their cars during the day, lock their doors and windows, put bicycles inside if they are leav-ing and lock scooters in a well-lit area.Event promotes break safety
Research, public schools to be affected
David Norton, vice presi-
dent for research at UF, said the cuts to research — which equal about 5 percent of federal fund-ing, or about $14 million annu-ally — will mean less support for graduate student research, fewer inventions from UF researchers and fewer companies sprung from research.
“From a national point of 
view, it’s a decrease in support for basic research funding at a time when we actually should be looking at increasing research because of the competitiveness in the global community,” he said.
The sequester will also impact 
public schools nationwide.
Jackie Johnson, spokeswom-
an for Alachua County Public Schools, said the cuts will be dev-astating on public education.
Although the district doesn’t 
know what the cuts will entail, she said it expects to face cuts of about 5 percent to 9 percent of the $39 million it receives annu-ally from the federal government for programs such as Title I and Head Start.
She said the cuts will impact 
the most vulnerable students: the poor and disabled.
“The worst-case scenario is 
that we have a whole lot of stu-dents going without services,” she said. “I don’t like to think about poor children missing out on meals because the federal gov-ernment can’t reach some sort of agreement on sequestration.”

The ‘60s furniture icon has become a practical solution 
for space-constrained apartment dwellers.
But for Byron Young, his future could be changed by 
his beanbag development.
Young, a 43-year-old UF alumnus and president of 
CordaRoy’s Beanbag Beds, will appear on ABC’s reality 
show, “Shark Tank,” on Friday.
Young’s patented products are beanbags that convert 
to beds. He runs his business at his northwest Gainesville store, located at  5310 NW Eighth Ave.
On the show, Young will ask the five investors, also 
known on as “sharks,” for funding toward his product.
Although Young couldn’t reveal the results of the 
show, he described how he felt being in front of TV cam-eras.
“It was the most terrifying experience of my life,” he 
said, “not just actually speaking in front of the ‘sharks,’ but the months leading up to it.”
In October, Young went to Orlando for an open casting 
call to get on the show. He said he waited in what seemed like an endless line.
“It felt a lot like the ‘American Idol’ auditions you see 
on TV ,” Young said.
While in line, Young was performing a demonstration 
for a potential customer when a casting staff member no-ticed his product and asked him to take his turn for an audition right then.
Young’s business isn’t the first Gainesville establish-
ment to be featured on the show.
Representatives from How Do You Roll?, a sushi fran-
chise opening inside the Stadium Club complex on West University Avenue, also made an appearance in front of the investors Feb. 15.
Matt Aschenbrener, chief financial officer of the sushi 
chain’s Gainesville location, said the show had a positive impact on the business.
“Since ‘Shark Tank’ aired, we actually did get a mil-
lion dollars in investments but also over 300 phone calls in Florida alone from people who wanted to open their own franchises of the company,” he said. “And across the country, there have been hundreds and hundreds of calls, too.”
There will be a watch party for Young’s episode at 
Cymplify Central and CYM Coffee Company, located at 5402 NW Eighth Ave.FRIDAY, MARCH 1, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 5

Aldo Araujo, an 18-year-old UF public relations 
freshman, has developed a routine in checking his Hot-
mail account.
But come this summer, Araujo and all other Hotmail 
users will see a switch-up when Outlook.com entirely replaces Hotmail as Microsoft’s new webmail service.
The concept behind the change is to take a step to-
ward building a new email service, according to Micro-soft’s website. Its focus is four points: delivering a fresh experience on modern browsers and devices, keeping people connected through all networks, providing an up-to-date inbox and putting people in control of their privacy.
“Emails are just emails, so making it look nicer and 
making it look more efficient . . . I’m not opposed to it,” Araujo said.
The update comes too late for some Hotmail users 
like Vicki Powell and Johana Ballesteros. They use the account for junk mail.
Powell, a 20-year-old UF family, youth and commu-
nity sciences junior, just uses her account for deals and sales at stores. Ballesteros, 19, a UF family, youth and community sciences sophomore, uses it for Facebook and Twitter updates.
They both use other email systems like Yahoo and 
UF’s Webmail for everyday emails.
Andrea Ramos, a 22-year-old UF marketing senior, 
is an avid Gmail user. She said she doesn’t have any interest in trying Outlook.
In an interview with NBC, David Law, director of 
product management for Outlook, said one-third of the current Outlook.com users either have or used to have a Gmail account.
That statistic made Ramos curious to learn more.“Makes me very curious into seeing why they 
changed from Gmail to Outlook and to maybe even ex-plore it,” Ramos said. “I am still loyal to Gmail, though, because I like it so much.”Hotmail to soon

This week, two senators introduced a new bill about the safety and selling of puppies through online breeder ser-vices. Puppy Uniform Protection and Safety Act  — fetch-
ingly abbreviated as the PUPS Act — wants to “close an Ani-mal Welfare Act loophole that has allowed large-scale online puppy breeders to skirt regulations and safety inspections,” reported the Hufﬁ  ngton Post. The senators who proposed it were Dick Durbin, of Illinois, and David Vitter, of Louisiana. We give a your-names-sound-like-villains-from-1940s-gang-ster-movies LAUREL to the PUPS Act. The press release from 
the senators seemed to base the bill off vague stories about the media, but if we somehow are the cause of the cutest act ever, then so be it.
Columnist Chloe Finch discussed Morrissey’s refusal to 
share the same timeslot as cast members of “Duck Dynasty” on Jimmy Kimmel’s show this week. Turns out, she was right about the family coming out on top of this slight disagreement. “The season three premiere delivered 8.6 million viewers,” re-ported Entertainment Weekly. “That’s huge. It’s not only the most-watched ‘Duck Dynasty’ episode ever, it’s A&E’s most-watched telecast ever and ranks as cable’s biggest reality show telecast so far this year. The 10 p.m. episode (the ﬁ  rst of two back-to-back airings) was up 132 percent vs. the second sea-son premiere.” We give a suck-it-Morrissey-reality-TV-is-awe-some-also-we’re-vegetarians-too-we’re-just-not-schmucks-about-it DART to Morrissey.

I voted in the SG election because it matters  
I’m ﬂ  abbergasted, dumbstruck, incredulous.
The Independent Florida Alligator is a student 
bastion intended to promote and assist UF students 
in all aspects — from police reports to athletics to Stu-
dent Government. 
Those of us who write opinion columns have an even 
greater responsibility when it comes to the realm of SG because we are allowed access to a greater audience — one we should strive to make sure continues to take us seriously, for the most part.
I had a column already submitted for the ﬁ  nal day 
before Spring Break. Then I opened to Page 6 and 7 to check up on my fellow columnists.
I became furious, enraged, livid.One of the columns was a chest-thumping-I-didn’t-
vote-here’s-why-and-I’m-proud-of-it article that blew my mind. We had columnists debate before this semes-ter, notably about rap music. I considered throwing in my two cents, but I decided against it because I priori-tized other issues. This issue takes priority.
Voting is a duty all eligible citizens should partici-
pate in, regardless of whether the contest is local, col-legiate, state or federal. 
I have every single “I voted” sticker stuck to a small 
magnet on my fridge because it ﬁ  lls me with pride to know I am continually involving and investing myself in a democratic process that makes my community — be it UF, Gainesville, Alachua County, Florida or the entire United States — a better place.
When I write my columns, I do so to encourage the 
ideals I believe in. I give my all to creating an articulate, yet impassioned, argument that seeks to improve the world I live in — even if it’s only by the tiniest iota. Even a column written around 3 a.m. with a nonsensical theme of defending haters has root in ideals that I strive to live by.
All of this led me to a sense of disbelief as I read the column further.
Although a small part of 
me is appreciative that an un-informed student chose not to vote, I have severe issues with why that voting didn’t occur. The column points out the at-tempts at rebranding one party undergoes to distance itself 
from previous scandals. 
This party, may I add, has had confrontations with 
the Alligator in the past. 
Events such as dumping papers, which should in-
cense any self-respecting columnist, journalism major or not, and conspiring in a ﬂ  ier campaign that encour-aged the removal of the iconic orange racks that hold a prestigious paper come to mind.
It is unacceptable that the greatest distinction one 
can make between two parties is between T-shirts. 
That is a failure as a citizen and a student before any-
thing else. It is disrespectful to those who try to further their cause in the marketplace of ideas. 
It is disrespectful to those who read the Alligator, 
and it is disrespectful to other columnists.
The column ends with the following sentence: “I felt 
power in lying to them about my voting status and felt power in not being part of their drama.”
This isn’t high school.The cliques of the popular kids decide more than 
where the cool table is located now.
If you can’t be bothered to take enough time to make 
a difference during election season, it’s wrong to expect people to view your opinion on the election as valid.
Enjoy the break, Gators.

opinions@alligator.org FRIDAY, MARCH 1, 2013  ALLIGATOR, 7
Last week, I wrote a column about the Swamp Party. I 
outlined some of the suspicious and unethical behav-ior of the Swamp Party and its predecessor parties.
This week, I would like to outline why the Swamp Party 
is dangerous to anyone in Student Government who has an opposing point of view, and I would also like to explain why minority organizations should stay far away from the Swamp Party.
In the Summer of 2011, the Student Senate passed the 
Fairness and Efﬁ  ciency Act. The Senate was led by Swamp’s predecessor, the Unite Party, at the time.
According to Alligator archives, the passage of the act 
“would grant the Senate president power to remove disrup-tive individuals from the chamber, give the judiciary com-mittee power to kill legislation before it reached the Senate ﬂ  oor, shorten debate time for certain motions and raise the number of votes needed to approve certain motions.”
The misnamed Fairness and Efﬁ  ciency Act effectively 
gave the majority the power to silence the minority.
I’m not sure Swamp cares any more about minority voic-
es than Unite did. It may be that Swamp is just as hostile to anyone with an opposing point of view, and that would be dangerous.
A Senate with a massive budget of $17.5 million dollars 
and runaway majority power can be dangerous to all stu-dents. The really scary part is some of these people may very well go into politics.If anyone cares anything about the minority voice, he or 
she should stay away from the Swamp Party for that reason alone.
The majority won’t care about minority representation 
or rights until the minority makes it the majority’s concern to care. This is as true for minority parties as it is for minor-ity organizations on campus.
Every group has its own agenda, including the majority. 
The majority will pursue its own agenda until the minority compels the majority to take notice and act.
I would like to draw on some analogies from UF his-
tory.
The UF Institute of Black Culture became part of UF in 
1971 after a tumultuous year of black student arrests, with-drawals, protests and sit-ins. The IBC was established as a direct result of those valiant student actions. In the face of racism, unity was established.
The IBC proudly displays old Florida Alligator clippings 
detailing the history of struggle between the black Student Body and then UF President Stephen C. O’Connell. 
The students protested and rallied, sat in at O’Connell’s 
ofﬁ  ce and ﬁ  nally started withdrawing from the university. Racism was met with a strong, nonviolent force, and racism was overcome.
Another analogy would be that of the Asian experience 
on campus. In 2001, a fraternity held a party in which males were dressed as American GIs and females were dressed as Vietnamese prostitutes, according to an article by the Florida Times-Union.
According to Leah Villanueva, 
the current director of Asian Pacif-ic Islander American Affairs at UF, in 2003, a rally was held after the fraternity held a similar Vietnam-themed party. Villanueva, who was present at the rally, said the Asian American Student Union 
called for certain reforms, including the establishment of the ofﬁ  ce that she now holds.
The moments when we are the most upright, both as a 
Student Body and as a species, are when we are sensitive to what others are due. Very often, this requires reminding people about the needs and agendas of others.
In other words, I’m not sure how much good it does for 
the minorities to submissively do the will of the majority. If the minorities are quiet and loyal to the majority, then the majority won’t worry about the minority’s needs.
If we’re all going to study and live together as equals, it 
might require some shouting, and that might mean staying far away from the Swamp Party.

After about ﬁ  ve months 
of training with the Alachua 
County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce, Kyle Reedy can call himself a deputy sheriff.
Reedy stood with pride in-
side ASO headquarters as his mother, a Gainesville Police of-ﬁ  cer, pinned his deputy badge onto his uniform. They saluted each other while Reedy’s father snapped pictures from the back of the room.
Reedy was part of a group 
of 16 ASO ofﬁ  cials honored during the ceremony Thursday afternoon.
Sheriff Sadie Darnell started 
by addressing the 12 ASO ofﬁ  -cials to be promoted in front of their families, friends and col-leagues. 
She gave them advice and 
focused on three points: to use their power judiciously , to ask for help and to always tell the truth.
“This is an important mo-
ment in history ,” she said. “Take a snapshot in your mind of this day.”
After the group recited the 
code of ethics, ASO spokes-man Art Forgey took the ﬂ  oor, 
re m i n d i n g the audience 
that human r e s o u r c e s p r o c e s s e d more than 1,500 appli-cations in the last year.
“This is 
truly the cream of the crop,” he said.
Brandi Mathis was the ﬁ  rst 
to be recognized with her pro-motion to detention ofﬁ  cer.
Darnell presented Mathis 
with a certiﬁ  cate and badge, which her mother pinned onto Mathis’ uniform with teary eyes.
Following Mathis’ promo-tion, the other 11 ofﬁ  cials re-cited the deputy oath and also received a badge and certiﬁ  cate from Darnell.
Donald West Jr., Howard 
Adams, Timothy Herring, Mi-chael McClenton and Shon McGuigan became detention deputies; James Abdale Jr. and James Roe were moved up to reserve deputies; and  Lance Pallett, Michael Lynch, Victor Pino-Diaz and Reedy became deputy sheriffs.
The ceremony also honored 
Sgt. Donald VanWie, Lt. Mi-chael S. Jones, Maj. Michael H. Fellows and Deputy Sheriff Jim C. Liddell for their 25 years of service.
Darnell said she looked for-
ward to the new class’ work with the sheriff’s ofﬁ  ce.
“As they go forth in their 
careers,” she said, “it will be-come something of a wonderful memory.”

◗ PEOPLE SPEND $2.98 A CUP.

A recent survey by Zagat discov-
ered the average coffee drinker in-
dulges in 2.2 cups each day. The love of the bean is so strong that in a sample of 1,700 caffeine lovers, a large major-ity are unwilling to go without it, even with the current economy and the high prices for a daily ﬁ  x.
Deborah Abrams, a 20-year-old UF 
economics junior, generally drinks the caffeinated beverage once a day. De-spite the cost, Abrams said Starbucks is her main coffee spot.
“It is expensive,” she said. “But if 
people buy it, then it’s working.”
According to Zagat, 83 percent of 
those surveyed said java is a “main-stay in their everyday routine.” How-ever, only 12 percent of voters said they could reduce their daily ﬁ  x intake.
The average coffee product costs 
$2.98, according to the survey . That  adds up to $774.80 for every weekday of the year. If a person splurges on 2.2 cups a weekday, it’s $1,704.56 a year.
Sara Mignano, a UF marketing 
freshman, said she drinks coffee at night so she can study . However, the 18-year-old said she does not need it.
UF health professor and nutrition 
specialist Linda Benjamin Bobroff said if someone is used to drinking coffee every day and skips a day , he or she can get a headache. Overconsumption of caffeine can also result in jitteriness.
“Know how you react to it,” she 
said.
Coffee consumption is about self-
control, Bobroff said. If drinking too much is causing problems, she added, consider drinking coffee in modera-tion.Coffee addicts double up 
on cups despite prices

Gators coach Kevin O’Sullivan 
isn’t hitting the panic button yet.
He’s been displeased with his 
team’s results, but he’s keeping 
things in perspective.
Even though Florida (3-6) is 
in the midst of its first five-game losing streak since 2008 as it hosts Miami (9-0) this weekend, the team is managing to keep an op-timistic outlook.“There’s no sense to keep 
harping on a loss or keep harp-ing on the mistakes,” O’Sullivan said. 
“There are positives. … Losing 
is contagious, but also winning is as well. All it takes is one good game and everybody is starting to feel good about themselves and you get things rolling in the right direction.”
UF lost five straight games 
under O’Sullivan in 2008 on the heels of a 20-5 start. The Gators rebounded from that slump with a three-game winning streak. Three of Florida’s six losses in 2013 have been in extra innings. The other three defeats have been by just one run, so the team be-lieves success isn’t far off.
“I think we need to improve 
and stay positive,” O’Sullivan said. “There’s not much we can do with what’s already hap-pened. Everyone knows we’ve been one pitch away in this ball game or one quality at-bat away in that ball game.”
However, O’Sullivan voiced 
his frustrations about Wednes-day’s 7-6 loss to North Florida im-
UF gymnast Marissa King’s 
parents attended their first Florida gymnastics meet on Feb. 22 in the O’Connell Center. See story, page 14.

Jennifer George wanted to cap a frustrat-
ing season with a victory in her final home 
game as a Gator. 
Actively engaged on both ends of the 
floor despite foul trouble and tweaking her injured right shoulder, Florida’s only senior ensured that would be the case. 
George notched her ninth double-double 
of the season as Florida put to rest its late-game demons on Thursday night, with-standing a late rally by Arkansas to win 69-58 in the O’Connell Center. 
“I didn’t cry, so that was a good thing,” 
George said. “That was a great way to go out.”
After dropping five of their past six homes 
games, the Gators appeared to be headed for an easy win, but the Razorback finally found their offensive rhythm midway through the second half. 
Trailing 49-34 with 11:46 remaining, Ar-kansas responded with a 21-6 run during the next 7:19 to tie the game at 55 with 4:27 remaining. 
After picking up her 
fourth foul with 10:03 re-
maining, George returned to help seal the victory.
Freshman Sydney Moss 
beat the shot clock with a pull-up jumper to give Florida a 57-55 lead after Arkansas tied the game on a layup by Keira Peak. George then scored on consecutive possessions, sparking an 11-1 run.
George finished with 13 points and 11 re-
bounds to go along with three assists, three blocks and two steals before being honored in a postgame Senior Night ceremony.
“Jennifer played like a senior, especially 
down the stretch, and really just anchored us in the paint and gave us confidence that whatever was going on, it was going to go Florida’s way,” coach Amanda Butler said.

Despite the Southeastern Conference title race implications on 
the line in Florida’s home matchup against Alabama on Saturday 
at noon in the O’Connell Center, coach Billy Donovan is taking a cautious approach with forward Will Yeguete (right knee) and 
guard Michael Frazier II (concussion).
Team doctors have 
cleared Yeguete and Frazier 
to play Saturday , but how much time both players will log off the bench is still uncertain.
The winner of Saturday’s contest will own the top spot in the 
Southeastern Conference standings with only two games remain-ing on the conference slate.
Yeguete is questionable to face the Crimson Tide. Donovan 
will make a decision on Yeguete’s return based on how the 6-foot-7 junior responds to full-contact drills.
“My expectation on him going into the game is not very high, 
just because I haven’t seen him play,” Donovan said. “Obviously, he’s got two days to practice, but I would be hard-pressed to be-lieve he’s going to be the same player … he was when he went down with his injury. It’ll probably take him some time to get back, but at least he can start working to get back in shape and get back in rhythm.”
Said Yeguete: “I’m not putting any pressure on myself. … 
I’m not expecting to play like 30 minutes in the first game. … If I played 5-10 minutes, I’d be happy with it.”
Since undergoing arthroscopic surgery on Feb. 8 to remove 
bone chips in his right knee, Yeguete has missed No. 8 Florida’s (22-5, 12-3 SEC) past six games. 
Without Yeguete, UF’s second-leading rebounder with 6.3 re-
bounds per contest, the Gators have won the battle on the boards once in the past six games.
After sitting out for nearly a month, Yeguete is excited to see 
the practice court. 
“I feel like a little kid right now,” he said. “It’s been a minute 
since I played with those guys and just be on the court and com-pete. But at the same time, I’m not going to be 100 percent and not going to be able to go up and down for 30 minutes like a regular practice. So it’s going to take time.”Key reserves cleared 
to return on Saturday

Florida senior Gabi Wiegand keeps last 
year’s Final Four game against Syracuse in 
the back of her mind.
Wiegand lined up at the 8-meter line af-
ter a hard foul. As soon as the whistle blew, she sprinted forward and launched the ball into the back of the net for what seemed to 
be the go-ahead goal. 
With seconds to 
spare in overtime, Wiegand and her teammates celebrat-
ed after nearly pulling off the impossible, guaranteeing a spot in the national champi-onship game.
But a whistle was blown. Wiegand’s stick was checked and deemed 
illegal. The net at the end of her stick was too deep. The goal was taken away. 
The Orange went on to defeat the Gators 
14-13 in double overtime.
“We definitely thought we had it,” Wie-
gand said referring to the Final Four match. “And it being my stick that was illegal, that’s something I keep in the back of my head and that pushes me through practice and through games.”
Coach Amanda O’Leary added: “It is what it is. It happened, and we can’t take it back, but it certainly is a learning opportu-nity and a learning situation for us.”
No. 2 Florida (6-0) will play No. 5 Syra-
cuse (2-1) on Saturday at Sun Life Stadium in Miami.
The Orange walked away with two wins 
in two matches against the Gators last year. Each victory came by one goal in extra time.
The abrupt end to Florida’s 2012 season 
has spawned the Gators’ 2013 slogan: un-finished business. O’Leary said the mantra applies in part to Syracuse because the team has something to prove.
Wiegand, though, sees it in a different 
light.
“I don’t think it’s specifically about Syra-
cuse because it’s more about us and how we didn’t finish what we wanted to last year, and we wanted a national championship,” Wiegand said. “Our unfinished business is winning this year… Finishing our mission.”
Florida’s undefeated 6-0 start to the 2013 
campaign has proven promising. But the Gators want to keep pushing. With unfin-ished business on her mind, Wiegand ex-pects UF to earn a different result against Syracuse.
“This time, I’ll go out with the same game 
plan and same mentality,” Wiegand said. “And, this time, my stick will be legal.”14, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, MARCH 1, 2013

Marissa King’s parents went 
48 meets without seeing her per -
form as a Gator. 
They watched her compete as 
an Olympian for Great Britain in 
2008.
Before last Friday’s meet 
against Kentucky, they were nev-er in attendance. 
But when No. 2 Florida (7-
1, 6-1 Southeastern Conference) faces No. 14 Minnesota (12-2, 4-1 Big 10) tonight at 7 in the O’Connell Center, King’s parents will be watching from the crowd — again. “Having them there on Friday 
night was really special,” King said.
“It kind of brought back old 
feelings of competing in Eng-land.”
Her parents, Clifford and Joy, 
watched as the Gators rallied past the Wildcats in front of a crowd of 4,321.
It was the first time they saw 
Marissa compete at the college level. 
When King traveled to the U.S. 
to compete as a college gymnast in 2010, she had no family roots in Gainesville aside from a close friendship with former Gators gymnast Nicola Willis. “Every time I competed in 
England, I always had my par -
ents watch me,” King said.
“It was really difficult as a 
freshman trying to get used to not having my family here at all.”
Despite living in a different 
country on her own, King has en-joyed an accomplished career at Florida.
She has earned All-American 
honors seven times and was named the 2011 NCAA Vault Champion in her sophomore year.
But with her success came 
challenges. 
As a sophomore, King under -
went foot and shoulder surger -
ies.
She had a slight tear in her 
left pectoral muscle and was forced to forgo competing at the 2010 Commonwealth Games. She named the pectoral injury the worst of her career. 
“I did have my coaches and my 
team, but the one thing I needed most was my closest friends and family, and I didn’t have that,” King said. 
Minor setbacks haven’t lim-
ited her this year, though. King has finished second in five events and posted a season-high 9.95 floor routine against Kentucky on Feb. 22. 
Even after three years with one 
of the top NCAA gymnastics pro-grams, coach Rhonda Faehn says King continues to push herself. 
“She has all these goals, and 
she’s up on the wall,” Faehn said. 
“(She’s) a national champion 
and she still wants to do even more this year.”
Senior gymnast excited to perform in front of parents again
“Every time I competed 
in England, I always had my 
parents watch me. It was 
really difficult as a freshman 
trying to get use to not

UF gymnastJunior guard Jaterra Bonds, the Southeastern Conference’s seventh-leading 
scorer entering Thursday with 14.4 points per game, nearly equaled her average 
before halftime. 
Bonds scored 13 of her game-high 18 points in the first half and finished an 
efficient 7-of-12 shooting in the game. 
“That consistency factor, you just can’t overlook that,” Butler said. “When 
you’ve got a player that you know you can count on for double-digit points … it helps everybody else fall in line.” 
Florida’s defense pestered a turnover-prone Arkansas before halftime. The Razorbacks shot just 7 of 27 in the first half in addition to their 13 turn-
overs, appearing out of sync offensively for most of the half. 
UF scored the final eight points of the half while holding Arkansas scoreless in 
the last 4:57 to take a 33-24 lead into halftime.  
Sophomore Kayla Lewis finished with 11 points and eight rebounds. Lewis 
said the victory was critical both to build momentum late in the season and to send George off with a win in her final game in the O’Connell Center.
“Before the game, [George] was saying: ‘This isn’t about me. This is about 
us building momentum into the SEC Tournament,’” Lewis said. “Ever since I’ve been here, it’s never been about her. 
“She can have 26 double-doubles in a row and not care about getting any of 
the credit. She just wants to win and do her part. I think tonight we did our part by getting her last win here.”

Junior forward Will Yeguete talks with fans following Florida’s 69-52 win against Kentucky on Feb. 12 in 
the O’Connell Center. Yeguete has been medically cleared to play against Alabama on Saturday at noon.
Florida had full team on 
practice floor on Thursday
Forward Casey Prather (face lac-
eration) is also cleared to play Satur -
day . Donovan previously thought 
Prather had suffered his third con-cussion of the year late in Florida’s 64-58 loss to Tennessee, but baseline tests proved otherwise. 
Frazier is more likely to play Sat-
urday than Yeguete, but Donovan is unsure if the Tampa native will see significant minutes.
The freshman guard suffered 
his concussion midway during the second half of Florida’s 71-54 vic-tory against Arkansas on Saturday after taking a knee to the head from guard Scottie Wilbekin on a dive for a loose ball. 
Frazier has averaged 6.4 points 
and 3.4 rebounds per game. He boasts a team-best 48.9 percent clip from behind the arc.
With Yeguete and Frazier 
cleared, the Gators had their full team on the practice floor Thursday for the first time since October.“It gives us back a full team at 
full strength,” forward Erik Mur -
phy said. “But that doesn’t give us any reason to expect anything out of them. … It might take a little time.”
As a bubble team hunting for 
quality wins, the Crimson Tide (19-9, 11-4 SEC) have won five of their last six contests. Alabama’s only loss during that stretch came in three overtimes on the road against LSU. 
Led by guard Trevor Releford, 
who averages 15.6 points per game, the Crimson Tide start four guards, creating a mismatch for oppos-ing teams. Alabama is 28th in the NCAA in adjusted defensive effi-ciency , according to KenPom.com 
Even if Florida plays its eight 
main contributors on Saturday , Donovan does not want his healthy players to get complacent. 
“They can’t rest and relax,” Don-
ovan said. “They cannot take the approach of, ‘Well, we’re a little bit deeper. We have more guys avail-able.’”hoopS , from page 13
women’S hoopS , from page 13Junior scored game-high 18O’Sullivan criticized his team’s 
lack of aggressive plate approach
mediately following the game in a 20-min-
ute meeting with his team in the dugout.  He criticized the players for their tentative approaches at the plate. 
While poor pitching hampered the 
Gators in the loss, they also made mental mistakes that upset O’Sullivan. Sophomore Justin Shafer was picked off at first base in the fifth inning after a leadoff single and likely would have scored on a Taylor Gushue single two batters later. The infield also failed to execute a rundown between second and third base in the top of the in-ning on a play during which UNF took a 4-3 lead.
“We practice every little situation,” third 
baseman Zack Powers said. “All that mat-ters is executing it in a game.”
The offense came alive in the game with 
13 hits, and it wasn’t something O’Sullivan overlooked. Rather, he hopes the team can build on its offensive success.“We’re close,” O’Sullivan said.“We’re close. We’re going to focus on 
the positives just like Wednesday night. I was really pleased with how we swung the bat.”
Jonathon Crawford will get the start for 
the Gators tonight, while the Hurricanes will counter with lefty Chris Diaz. Tucker Simpson will start 
Saturday, and Sunday’s starter will depend on how much Florida uses its bullpen dur -
ing the first two games. O’Sullivan said he hopes Crawford can set the tone for the se-ries going forward. 
“We’re going to focus on the positives 
and try to correct our mistakes and stay fo-cused on one thing,” O’Sullivan said.
“And that’s coming out on Friday night 
and Jonathon putting up a zero in the first inning and having a good game. It’s really as simple that.”

After yet another poor perfor -
mance on the mound, closer Johnny 
Magliozzi had enough. He brought Florida’s pitching staff together for a meeting after Wednesday’s extra-inning loss to North Florida.
Six pitchers combined to issue 
four walks, hit two batters and allow seven base runners on two-strike counts.
Having pitchers extend innings 
has been a death sentence for an offense struggling with situational hitting. After the Gators took a 1-0 lead in the second on Friday against Florida Gulf Coast ace Ricky Knapp, Jonathon Crawford lost command in the sixth. 
The Friday night starter hit the 
No. 9 batter to lead off the inning and then issued a one-out walk one batter later. 
Coach Kevin O’Sullivan pulled 
Crawford and the Eagles’ Brooks Beisner hit a three-run homer two batters later off Daniel Gibson. Each time the Gators have taken a lead this year, their pitching staff seem-ingly falls apart.
“(We need to) let our hitters get 
comfortable in the box, because we really haven’t been doing that,” Crawford said.
Crawford gets another chance to 
improve his command when Florida hosts Miami tonight at 7.
He’s expected to face more batters 
as O’Sullivan continues to increase his pitch count with each start.With Florida’s bullpen at 55.2 in-
nings through nine games, seeing a starter last past the sixth inning would be a welcome sight. UF start-ing pitchers have thrown just 31.1 innings in nine games.
“He got close to 80 pitches last 
time out,” O’Sullivan said of Craw-ford. “He’s getting close to that 100-pitch mark now.”
A longer outing won’t be a guar -
antee. Crawford still has to hold up his end of the bargain — a task every Florida pitcher has had trouble with this season.
“Just focus on attacking the hit-
ters and let themselves get out,” Crawford said. “That in turn will help me get deeper into games.”
O’Sullivan held his own candid 
dugout meeting before his pitchers met separately following the loss to North Florida. The sixth-year coach acknowledges that he can only say so much. The rest is up to the play-ers.
“We can have all the meetings 
we want,” O’Sullivan said. “It’s pretty simple. We got to get the ball down and we got to pitch a little bit better.”
Miami Hurricanes starting rotation:  
Chris Diaz faced the Gators last sea-
son in relief in Coral Gables.
A year later he faces them again, 
but as the Friday night starter at McKethan Stadium. The sophomore is 1-0 with a 0.75 ERA in two starts this year.
Junior right-hander Javi Salas 
gets the nod for Saturday . He hasn’t allowed an earned run in two starts this season.
Left-hander Andrew Suarez 
makes his third career college start in the series finale. The former To-ronto Blue Jays ninth-round pick missed his entire freshman season due to Tommy John surgery.

Gators need starters to last longer, take pressure off bullpen

For the first time in 2013, No. 4 Florida 
(17-1) has gone a week without run-ruling an 
opponent. 
Despite the offense cooling down from its 
hot start the first two weeks of the season, the Gators are 6-1 since they run-ruled Charles-ton Southern 9-1 on Feb. 17.
The reason is simple — only one team in 
that seven-game span has scored more than three runs against the Florida pitching staff.
“We’re not thinking too hard about the 
game,” junior pitcher Hannah Rogers said. “We’re just going out there and doing what we know best.”
In the last week, Florida pitchers have an 
ERA of 1.64. Without the Gators’ 12-inning, 4-3 loss to No. 6 Missouri on Feb. 22, the staff ERA falls to 1.40.
Rogers anchors the Gators’ rotation, and 
she’s pitched more innings than the rest of the staff combined. 
She has pitched in four of Florida’s last 
five games. In Palm Springs, the junior shut out Loyola Marymount on Feb. 21 and came out of the bullpen to relieve sophomore Lau-ren Haeger against Missouri and Georgia Tech on Feb. 22 and 23, respectively. Rogers also started against USF on Wednesday.
Against the Bulls, Rogers tossed a com-plete game, allowing only one run on a fourth-inning homer to Kenshyra Jackson. She struck out five while walking two.
“I thought I came out 
pretty strong,” Rogers said. “They got a few bats on the ball, but we played awe-some defense [Wednesday night], so it didn’t really matter.”
But Rogers is not the 
only pitcher who has been dominating in the pitch-
ing circle. Sophomore Alyssa Bache has con-tinued putting up dominant numbers in her starts. “I think she’s more relaxed this year,” Rog-
ers said of Bache. “She’s been working hard in the bullpen on hitting good spots, and also she’s throwing a lot harder this year.”
Bache’s last start came against Syracuse on 
Feb. 22, and allowed only one run while strik-ing out nine in seven innings en route to a 5-1 Gators victory.
Pitching deep into the game and punching 
out multitudes of opposing batters has been a common theme for Bache this year. She has completed all four games she’s started, and she is averaging 8.68 strikeouts per seven in-nings pitched, the best rate on the team.
