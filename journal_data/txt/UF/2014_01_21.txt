Students aimlessly scanning Library 
West for a study spot may have a better 
option next school year: Marston Science Library will offer a renovated study space for more than 600 students.
UF President Bernie Machen recently 
approved plans for the $5.7 million reno-vation project, which will turn the ﬁ  rst ﬂ  oor of Marston into a study area for stu-dents.
The space will include about 25 study 
rooms, 70 additional computers and po-tentially a Starbucks.  
Diane Bruxvoort, senior associate dean 
of UF libraries, said the university has only 3,400 study spaces available for the thou-sands of students who attend UF. “Library West is full much of the time,” 
Bruxvoort said. “People are sitting on the ﬂ  oor huddled in corners. We certainly ex-pect that this space will be of great use.”
Students can expect renovations to be-
gin in early May, but the space will still be open to students studying for ﬁ  nals.
“I don’t think we will be at the point of 
disrupting ﬁ  nals,” Bruxvoort said. 
But the changes to Marston are still a 
concern to some students who regularly

UF Online has opted to begin hosting 
several of its courses on Canvas, a new 
course management system, starting this semester.
The introduction of this new course 
website is part of a phased rollout to get all classes offered through UF Online hosted on a platform other than its counterpart, e-Learning, by Spring 2015.
“The reason why we are using Canvas 
this semester is that with the new UF On-line, some of the things we needed to do were not available on (e-Learning),” said Tawnya Means, director of the Center for 
Teaching, Learning and Assessment at 
UF’s Warrington College of Business Ad-ministration.

This Fall, students will be trading in their Burger King 
shakes for Frosties as Wendy’s returns to the Reitz Union.
Jill Rodriguez, marketing program manager for Gator Din-
ing Services, wrote in an email Wendy’s will soon be back.
“We had the opportunity to bring back a very popular din-
ing option to UF’s campus,” she said. “We are very excited to welcome back Wendy’s.”
Current Burger King employees will continue working with 
Gator Dining after the change.
Due to declining sales, Cheeburger Cheeburger Express re-
placed the Wendy’s in the Reitz Union in 2009. Burger King 
opened in 2011.
Kyle Kennedy, a 19-year-old UF industrial and systems en-
gineering junior, said he frequents Wendy’s off campus, and he is looking forward to having a Wendy’s on campus.
“Wendy’s has a few more options,” he said.Wendy’s was named after the daughter of Wendy’s found-
er Dave Thomas. His daughter, Melinda “Wendy” Morse, is a UF alumna.
Mackenzie Hagen, a 20-year-old UF food and resource eco-
nomics junior, has never gone to the Reitz Union Burger King. Hagen said she would rather go to Wendy’s than Burger King because of Wendy’s healthier food choices.
“Wendy’s just advertises that they are healthier for you, and 
I agree,” she said.Wendy’s to return to Reitz Union food court, replace Burger King SEE MARSTON, PAGE 4

Zombies, wookies and su-
perheroes convened this week-
end to celebrate the third annual SwampCon.
Saturday and Sunday, people 
of all ages and fandoms gathered at the Reitz Union to celebrate their favorite books, TV shows, games and characters.
Attendees could participate 
in panel discussions, play games, join tournaments, watch perfor-mances or participate in other activities like scavenger hunts.
Vic Meredith, a moderator 
for several panels at SwampCon, said she thinks the UF conven-tion combines several aspects of many other popular conven-tions.
 “There’s a nice mix of anime, 
sci-fi, gaming and panels here that you usually don’t see in most other conventions,” Mer-edith said.
Amber Hollingsworth, a 
panelist at SwampCon, said this is her 10th year attending con-ventions. She said she appreci-ates that UF has something most venues don’t: on-site refresh-ments.
“It’s nice that they have food 
and drinks readily available,” she said. “Other places, all you have is that $7 pretzel.”
She said that another positive 
aspect to UF’s convention was the broad range of topics and ac-tivities available to participants. 
Lawrence Chan, a 20-year-
old UF journalism junior and the main event coordinator for SwampCon, said turnout im-proves each year as the event grows.
However, because most con-
ventions are expensive, Chan credited some of SwampCon’s popularity to the free admis-
sion.
Most of this year’s attendees 
were from Florida, but some 
came from as far as California, he said.
“You see all these people 
talking, chatting,” said Chan. “They’re all happy about being here, seeing different things, go-
ing to different conventions.”
Chan has been to several con-
ventions, but this was his first 
time organizing one. 
He compared the passion 
that these people have for their hobbies to the passion of fans cheering for their team at a foot-ball game.
“Ultimately, we are provid-
ing a medium for people to fol-low their dreams, follow their interests,” said Chan.

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
FORT MYERS BEACH — Two pilot 
whales died and a third would be eutha-
nized after roughly four dozen whales swam into shallow waters Monday off southwest Florida, wildlife officials said.
A handful of the whales were strand-
ed near shore in Lee County, while more than a dozen others swam nearby, said Kim Amendola of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Fish-eries Service.
An additional 12 whales were spotted 
farther offshore earlier in the morning.
Necropsies would be performed on 
the three beached whales, said NOAA regional stranding coordinator Blair Mase.
The remaining whales were listless 
and emaciated, and many wouldn’t react if a boat approached them, Mase said.
“They all look in really bad shape,” 
she said. She expected that more whales could die by Tuesday morning.
Meanwhile, roughly two dozen other 
pilot whales were being monitored off Collier County. Those whales were in the same pod that swam into shallow waters off Naples on Sunday, Amendola said. 
A few temporarily beached them-
selves Sunday before swimming out with the tides.
They also seemed to be in poor 
shape.
“They’re definitely out of their home 
range, and they look like they’ve been out of their home range for quite a while,” Mase said.
Pilot whales typically swim in deeper 
waters farther offshore. It wasn’t imme-diately clear what caused the whales to swim so close to land.
The pilot whale is a common species 
involved in mass strandings. 
In early December, more than 50 pilot 
whales became stranded in Everglades National Park. Seven died and four were euthanized before the rest apparently swam back into deeper waters.South Florida

RESEARCH
ARIANA FIGUEROA
Alligator Contributing Writer
A professor has configured a gadget to 
help recovering animals rest more soundly. 
Jenshan Lin, a professor in UF’s electrical 
and computer engineering department, re-
cently finished creating a monitor that tracks 
the heart rate and respirations in animals 
without the need for physical contact. 
After surgery, animals tend to bite and 
scratch wires attached to them, which can either unhook them from monitors or cre-ate false readings. The new wireless monitor avoids these problems.  
The monitor is about half the size of a 
shoe box and can hang on the side of cages. 
It uses radio waves to detect motions, re-
moving the need for monitors to be hooked up to the animal. With a battery life of about seven hours, veterinary technicians don’t have to constantly check the animals’ vitals, letting the animals heal in comfort.
Lin first began research and construction 
of the device about a decade ago.  
The radio waves work like a Doppler ra-
dar and detect changes in the animal’s heart 
rate. Lin said it’s like a radar gun that law 
enforcement uses for monitoring the speed of cars.
The catch is, unlike speeding cars, recov-
ering animals are sedentary.
“The trick is that even though the animal 
is not moving, the radar picks up a high-frequency movement,” he said. “It’s a very sensitive motion detector.”
This is not a new idea, Lin said. As futur-
istic as it sounds, the idea for a wireless mon-itor first came out in the 1980s for search-and-rescue missions.
Another company is testing the monitor for use on premature babies. When used on a simulated premature baby, the monitor was proven to be accurate in every reading. Tests are still being conducted at UF Health Shands Hospital, Lin said.
Within the next few months, Lin said, he 
hopes the device can be available for local animal hospitals. An app is in the works.
Laura Cohen, the owner of High Springs 
Animal Hospital — where the monitor identified a cat with heart problems during a test — said without the discomfort of be-ing attached to wires, animals can recover in peace.  
“It’s more comfortable for them,” Cohen 
said.
She said other veterinarians at the hospi-
tal responded favorably to using the device. 
“It’s a very positive force for the profes-
sion,” Cohen said.   Professor develops wireless pet heart monitor

Gainesville Police arrested a Fort White 
man early Saturday after officers said he in-
jected himself with pain reliever then tried to steal items from a local Wal-Mart.Officers arrested 40-year-old Tracy Kyle 
Davis on charges of petit theft, resisting re-
covery of property, possession of a controlled 
substance without a prescription and posses-sion of drug equipment, according to an arrest report.
At about 1 a.m., an employee of the Wal-
Mart Supercenter at 5700 23rd St. noticed Davis stick cologne, a package of LifeStyles condoms, a flashlight and two packages of Bic lighters in the breast pocket of his jacket.Despite having more than $200 on him, Da-
vis hid the items, worth about $47. He bought 
only a stick of deodorant at checkout, accord-
ing to the report. Two employees stopped Da-vis while he left the store and took him to the loss prevention office. One of the employees held Davis down to stop him from escaping until police arrived.
Officers found a needle and syringe inside 
of his jacket pocket as well as a container with two pills of the painkiller Dilaudid in his right pants pocket and a crack pipe in his left pants pocket, according to the report.
During questioning, Davis said he smoked 
crack cocaine earlier in the night and inject-ing the Dilaudid with the syringe less than an hour before going to Wal-Mart. Davis said he does not have a prescription for the pain medi-cation, according to the report.
Officers booked him into jail, where he 
remained as of press time in lieu of a $25,000 bond.

Clara Mabour, a 20-year-old UF bi-
ology sophomore, said she ﬁ  nds Mar-
ston to be a quieter study space than other libraries on campus. Mabour said 
she does not want Marston to become 
like Library West, where people often go to socialize instead of study.
“People who really want to study 
come here,” she said. “Library West is more social — it’s for group studying. It might be pretty good to have a Star-bucks though.”
Even though a Starbucks is already 
located nearby Marston in the Hub, ne-gotiations are still being held to have Starbucks inside the library. 
Once funding becomes accessible, 
Newell Hall will also be converted into a study space for students.The planned renovations come after 
college campuses across the U.S. are moving library collections online to make room for bookless study spaces.  
Marston currently houses thou-
sands of government documents and scientiﬁ  c journals, which will all be 
placed into storage and will be avail-
able upon student request or via elec-tronic access.
Back in 2009, study rooms were 
added to the second ﬂ  oor of Marston. 
Rin Azrak, a 20-year-old UF biotech-
nology junior, said renovating Marston would be a nice change because Li-brary West is often too crowded for her 
to study there.
“It will be more efﬁ  cient for people 
to study in,” she said. “Library West 
gets cramped. It’s always ﬁ  rst-come ﬁ  rst-serve, unless you have a friend save a spot for you.”4, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, JANUARY 21, 2014

Swamp Records, the UF student-
produced record label, will be host-
ing a showcase presented by Student Government Productions.
On Friday at 7:30 p.m., a variety 
of local bands and artists will gather at The JAM, 817 W. University Ave., 
to perform and network.
“The goal of this event is to cel-ebrate the launch of Swamp Records 
this year and provide more informa-tion to the public about who we are 
and what we aim to do,” wrote Ra-
chel Ring, head director for Swamp Records, in an email.
Ring, a 21-year-old UF manage-
ment senior, said Swamp Records hopes to promote and support local Gainesville talent and help take their careers to the next level.
Swamp Records is looking for bands with a strong following, stage presence and quality material, she said. 
“Our bands cover a range of genres including: electronic, funk/soul, hip-hop and more,” she said.
However, Ring said no bands 
will be signed until Swamp Records secures the legal right to do so.
The event will feature two stages: 
one outdoors and one inside with bands performing all night. 
One of the performances fea-
tured at the showcase will be Bells and Robes, a Gainesville-based two-person electronic band formed by UF graduates. 
Luke Sipka, co-producer for Bells 
and Robes, said he hopes to see the 
showcase foster a better relationship 
between UF and the music scene.
“I’ve read about so many cities 
where a venue forms, and a scene starts with locals that eventually have a huge impact,” Sipka wrote  in an email. “I feel like something along these lines is forming in Gainesville.”

Canvas offers interactive features, as well as different ways to communicate with professors and other students in the class. 
“Because video is integrated into the entire course site, basi-cally any time you want to interact with your instructor, you can do it by video, audio or text,” Means said. 
Canvas isn’t restricted to students pursuing a degree 
through UF Online. Traditional students may have sections hosted on Canvas, too.
“I think it’s easy to use, but it’s pretty inconvenient having 
some classes on Canvas and some on e-Learning,” said Virginia Pedigo, a 20-year-old UF applied physiology and kinesiology sophomore, whose macroeconomics class uses Canvas. 
Jose Muia, a 20-year-old UF ﬁ  nance sophomore, said he 
didn’t hear about the switch until he returned from break.
“Two of my three courses are on Canvas,” he said. “It’s

To celebrate Martin Luther King Jr. Day, 
about 350 volunteers grabbed rakes, blow-
ers, gloves and brushes.
Students and residents arrived at the 
Reitz Union early Monday to participate in 
the annual UF Center for Leadership and 
Service’s MLK Day of Service.
The event kicked off with breakfast in 
the Grand Ballroom, a visit from Alberta and performances from an African choir and the Gator Dazzlers. 
Then, volunteers were divided into 
groups and sent to work at about 18 sites, said Angela Garcia, an event coordinator. Some sites included Einstein Montessori School, Forage Farm and the Historic Haile Homestead at Kanapaha Plantation. The only on-campus locations were Wilmot Gardens and the UF Natural Area Teach-ing Laboratory.
The volunteers participated in activities 
such as landscaping, gardening and paint-
ing, Garcia said.
At the end of the event, the service 
groups held reflection sessions to let volun-
teers share what they learned. 
“The group reflection at the end is im-
portant because hopefully (volunteers) will make the connection of why they are doing that service and the ‘Now what?’” Garcia said.
Dan Sibol, a 21-year-old AmeriCorps 
VISTA employee, said the pumped-up kick-off ceremony helped energize volun-teers.
“We have a lot of people here to get 
everyone excited, even an African choir,” he said. “We have kind of transformed it 
from just a ‘Here’s your site, see you later,’ 
to more of a celebration. And I think this is what it is all about, celebrating service and getting everyone together.”

UF is the first university to implement 
TapShield, a new application aimed at 
keeping students safe.
The campus safety app is set to debut 
this week, and it includes features such as 
a real-time GPS locator and a customizable 
profile. 
 “The app will provide an extra layer of 
security for all the students,” said Jessica Gates,  a TapShield spokeswoman.
Gates collaborated with university offi-
cials to make the app, which will be free to students and faculty.
The app is set up through an incident re-
sponse platform, which provides two-way communication between the user and Uni-versity Police dispatch, Gates said.
She said whenever the app is launched, 
it automatically sends police the user’s real-time GPS location along with his or her user profile information.
The app has a mode that allows users to 
chat electronically with the dispatcher for 
circumstances when the user does not want 
to be overheard talking to the police.
Student Body President Christina Bonar-
rigo said the impact of the new safety app will be significant. 
“It’s going to provide an extra element of 
security to students,” she said.
Maria Lyn Cauthorn, a 20-year-old UF 
industrial and systems engineering junior, 
said she sometimes feels unsafe while run-
ning alone on or near campus after dark, so she would like to download the new app. 
“It’s more convenient than calling 911 or 
going to one of the blue lights,” she said. New 911 app

ALACHUA — Whenever a 
horse arrives at Mill Creek Farm in 
Florida, Peter and Mary Gregory make the aging animal a promise to last the rest of its days.
“We say you’ll never be worked 
or ridden again,” said Peter Grego-ry, director of the farm. “And you’ll be here forever. And they are here forever because when they die here, they’re buried here.”
About 130 horses have this 265-
acre farm in north-central Florida as their retirement home, doted on by 
now elderly caretakers. Nearly all of 
the horses have worked for years in law enforcement, military or other service jobs; a few have been seized by police.
Now, these horses graze in green 
pastures under moss-draped oaks. Their tranquil existence is only bro-ken each day by Peter, 85, and his 
wife Mary, 81, riding out on golf 
carts from their home on the proper-ty. From field to field they go, feed-ing the horses hay, grain and carrot treats.
“It’s difficult to find any place 
that will take an older retired horse. We wanted Special to actually truly 
be retired,” said Sgt. Chris Laster of 
the Sarasota County Sheriff’s Office, who brought a 23-year-old horse to the farm for retirement in 2013. “Pe-ter knows every horse’s name there; he knows their stories.”
Originally from England, the 
Gregorys spent years traveling the world when Peter was a hotel man-
ager. In 1984, they bought the farm 
about 20 miles north of Gainesville and created a nonprofit organiza-tion called the Retirement Home for Horses. It’s since drawn tourists, documentary filmmakers and other visitors curious about where veteran horses go.
Some of the horses are blind. 
Some are ill. And all would have ended up at an out-of-country slaughterhouse had the Gregorys not taken them in. The farm doesn’t accept horses from private owners. There are other horse retirement farms in the U.S. — in Kentucky, Tennessee and Connecticut — and there are only a few, much smaller farms for aging horses in Florida.
There’s Special, a horse who 
worked for the Sarasota County Sheriff’s Department for 17 years and whose last big event was the 2012 Republican National Conven-tion in Tampa.
And there’s Roman, a 13-year vet-
eran of the Orange County Sheriff’s Office who helped search for little Caylee Anthony, who went missing 
in 2008 and later was found slain. 
When Roman arrived last summer, he sought out Dylan, another Or-ange County Sheriff’s horse that had retired a few years before. The pair have stuck close to each other in one pasture ever since.
“Most horses, when they get old, 
if they do get old, then nobody wants 
them anymore,” Gregory said.
There’s a special patch of land 
where the horses are buried; a sign 
that says “Field of Dreams” stands in a clearing. A tree is planted for each horse buried in the field, mark-ing the animals’ final resting spots.

INTERLACHEN, Fla.  — A north Florida woman is hos-
pitalized after being shot by sheriff’s deputies responding to 
her calls about prowlers outside her home.
Putnam County Sheriff’s Sgt. Hancel Woods said Diana 
Lucille Conner was shot after she came out of her house and fired a rifle.
Woods told the Florida Times-Union that Conner called 
the sheriff’s office early Monday.
But she didn’t believe the deputies who responded were 
law enforcement, even after they turned on their patrol cars’ emergency lights.
Deputies left Conner’s Interlachen home, then returned 
about two hours later when neighbors complained that Con-ner called them about a prowler. 
Woods says deputies ordered Conner to drop her weapon, 
but she opened fire instead.
The deputies fired back. The sheriff’s office said Conner 
was struck four times.Woman shoots

Remembering 
MLK’s death
The state of Florida granted UF students and staff a 
day off from work and classes to honor the memory of Martin Luther King Jr., a pioneer of civil rights for 
black Americans. You already know this, of course. Every elementary-school curriculum includes the study of King and his famous “I Have a Dream” speech. 
However, we tend to look back upon King’s legacy with a 
soft ﬁ  lter, remembering only King’s beautiful speeches about brotherhood. Nearly half a century has passed since King’s assassination. It’s easy for white Americans to forget that King was a highly controversial ﬁ  gure, and his assassination in Memphis in 1968 was not a random incident. In 1999, ac-
cording to The New York Times, a Memphis jury decided 
that a retired Memphis cafe owner was part of a conspiracy in King’s murder after King’s family brought forth a civil suit. 
According to the Times, “After four weeks of testimony 
and one hour of deliberation, the jury in the wrongful-death case found that Loyd Jowers as well as ‘others, including governmental agencies’ had been part of a conspiracy.”
King’s killing was, as former U.S. President Lyndon B. 
Johnson said, no act of “blind violence.” Other agencies were complicit in the wrongful death of an outspoken activist who condemned not only the way black people were treated in America, but also the Vietnam War and the way poverty was 
handled in this country. 
Dexter King, Martin Luther King Jr.’s youngest son, told 
The New York Times in 1999 that he hoped history books 
would be rewritten to reﬂ  ect the newest — and most accu-rate — account of his father’s assassination. 
While it’s important to remember the messages of nonvio-
lence that King passed, it’s also equally important to discuss the government’s possible involvement in King’s death and to remember that the U.S. — our “land of the free” — has 
committed some deeply disturbing acts over the course of its 
history and continues to do so. Drone strikes, anyone?
Our generation is one that trusts the government less than 
those before us. It makes sense, then, to open the ﬂ  oor to talk about institutional racism and its deadly effects on citizens 
— especially those who dare to be outspoken. 
Although his most memorable words come from the “I 
Have a Dream” speech, we leave you with a part of his last 
speech delivered in Memphis the night before he was killed. 
“I’ve seen the promised land,” he said. “I may not get 
there with you. But I want you to know tonight, that we, as a people, will get to the promised land. And I’m happy tonight. I’m not worried about anything. I’m not fearing any man. Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord.”Celebrate life by not fearing death
Although Woody Allen’s quip, “I don’t want to 
achieve immortality through my work; I want to achieve immortality through not dying,” is fa-
mous, the best line about death comes from British en-tertainer Bob Monkhouse: “I want to die like my father, peacefully in his sleep, not screaming and terriﬁ  ed, like his passengers.”
Death can be a funny topic, but usually, it isn’t. How 
come? 
For starters, no one likes thinking about death. We 
love this whole “living” phase, and most people will try anything to stay alive. But why do people cling to life so tightly while no similar fetish for death can be found?
Relatively speaking, not too many humans have come 
into existence, yet we’re among the lucky few. Each of us is a statistical anomaly — call it a miracle, if you want to get corny. Kurt Vonnegut, a lifelong atheist, said it best: “God said to some of the mud, ‘Sit up!’... And I was some of the mud that got to sit up and look around. Lucky me, lucky mud.”
But unlike the diversity of life, death is deﬁ  nitive. It is 
the grand ﬁ  nale for everyone — no matter how a person lives, death takes you to where you are, simply no more. 
Despite the obviousness of death, few people take it 
seriously, and even fewer in our age group do. This is nor-mal, considering that even soldiers facing death think, “It can’t happen to me. I’m too clever/agile/well-trained/good-looking/beloved/tightly laced, etc.” 
As Henry David Thoreau wrote, “A man can attend 
but one funeral in the course of his life, can behold but one corpse.” It’s only when someone actually dies that he or she can ﬁ  nally wake from the slumber of life to the reality of death. 
But a logical question arises: What’s the point of life if 
we’re all dead in a few years anyway?
Life’s intrinsic value comes from knowing that death is 
around the corner. There is an invisible stopwatch some-where out there, counting down the seconds that each of us has remaining on this planet, and this is what makes life so pre-cious.
One of the founders of the 
Streetlight program at UF Health Shands Hospital, Rebecca Brown, told me how, one frosty morn-
ing, while walking across her nature trail, she came across a shimmering spider web. In the middle of the web lay a dead spider, frozen from the cold. 
Brown says about the dead spider, “Spinning a web is 
what she does … she died in her web, and that is an honor-able way to go.” 
Meeting death, while doing what you are meant to do, 
to borrow from Brown’s eloquence, “means to die, liv-ing.”
Leo Tolstoy’s “The Death of Ivan Ilyich” sheds some 
light on what we are “meant to do.” The main character, Ivan, is petriﬁ  ed of parting with his comfortable life and begins to howl ceaselessly for three days and nights on his deathbed. He repeatedly refers to death as “it” — using the impersonal pronoun to convey how far-off the concept of death appears. At the same time, “it,” in Russian, also means “she” — suggesting how intimate death actually is.
An hour before Ivan’s death, he glances at his family 
and for just a moment, feels genuine sympathy for them. Suddenly, “instead of death there was light,” writes Tol-stoy.
In being genuine — not merely going with the tides of 
social norms — and compassionate, we transcend death.  A 19th century poet, Thomas Campbell, conﬁ  rms this: “To live in hearts we leave behind is not to die.”

As with any new 
trend, the Internet has had strong 
opinions about the sub-ject of selﬁ  es.  Many peo-
ple argue that they are 
conceited, the evidence of our self-centered genera-tion. The word “selﬁ  es” even sounds like “self-ish.” But these judgments are practi-cally archaic.
Essentially, everything we publish 
for people to see or read is a bit vain. 
We’ve judged an article or video worth 
sharing, and it is a representation of ourselves. Selﬁ  es are also representa-tions of ourselves, but people seem to be against them because they are based on physical appearance. However, both are forms of seeking approval. 
From an early age, we are taught 
to strive for beauty and success but 
to hide our efforts and play down our 
accomplishments. If you walk into a kindergarten class, the children show off their artwork, outﬁ  ts or a new song they learned. But once those children grow up and go to high school, they’ve learned that it is socially unacceptable to let others know you believe in your-self. Go into a high-school classroom, 
and students may hesitantly raise 
hands, answer questions with a ques-tion or deﬂ  ect compliments. 
When I give a friend a compliment, 
I want him or her to believe it and say “thank you” with pride. There is noth-ing wrong with being a little vain, and often, we have to ﬁ  ght for whatever self-pride we have. So I am happy to 
like friends’ selﬁ  es. They are showing 
they are strong enough to withstand the pressures of the media and society and accept themselves.
A selﬁ  e may also mean 
that the subject may only like themselves in that photo, at that angle and 
in that particular outﬁ  t. 
Maybe by taking a picture they like of themselves, they are gaining some self-acceptance, and I ful-
ly support that. Some people even post selﬁ  es as motivators to get in shape. 
I think the backlash against selﬁ  es 
can be summed up by the idiotic song 
by the idiotic One Direction that says, 
“You don’t know you’re beautiful, and that’s what makes you beautiful.” Self-ies corrupt the mystique that people don’t know they are beautiful because, by taking those photos, they are tak-ing pride in their appearances. And for some reason, we like people to keep up this performance of trying to look 
good but acting like they don’t realize 
it, which is absurd. 
Some people criticize selﬁ  es because 
they believe the people taking them think they are the center of the uni-verse. I argue that’s like telling a child who hasn’t ﬁ  nished his or her dinner that people are starving in Africa. It is unrealistic to compare one’s personal 
situation to everything else that is go-
ing on in the world. If we were all con-stantly thinking about that, I don’t how many of us would still get out of bed each morning, nonetheless laugh and take a selﬁ  e break.
To selﬁ  es, I say hold your head up 
high. Or, if you prefer, down at a 45-degree angle, and make whatever face 
you want at the camera. I’ll like it.

Everyone is entitled to his or 
her own opinions, but not his or her own facts. Nearly 
33 percent of the American popu-lation — and yes, we are talking 
2014 here — does not believe in 
evolution. 
Why is this so harmful, you 
may ask? Because although we still technically refer to evolution as a theory, it is the most scien-tiﬁ  cally accepted explanation for how life on Earth has operated for billions of years. 
Evolution, by deﬁ  nition, is a process of 
slow change and development over time. Sci-entists will argue which deﬁ  nition is the most correct, but, for our intents and purposes, let’s stick with this one. Generally, the principle of evolution holds that as time progresses, or-ganisms will need to meet a certain standard of survival criteria, for example, accessibility of food or how vulnerable the organism is to predation. 
Those individuals who cannot meet this 
standard will die off while the so-called victors will survive and procreate, perpetually donat-ing their awesome DNA to the living gene pool. Over a long period of time, the physical and genealogical makeup is altered, showing us gradual differences in appearance. 
Contrary to popular belief, we are not 
chimpanzees, but we share a common ances-
tor with them — along with 98.8 percent of 
our DNA. That 1.2 percent difference between us accounts for 35 million differences. The most apparent of these may include walking upright, larger brains and the ability to speak. 
And although I wasn’t there, there was 
not a moment at the beginning of time where modern humans were simply dropped onto this Earth alongside fruit-bearing trees and gliding gazelles already prepackaged and ready to go. Everything that exists today is a product of evolution. Humans, 
dinosaurs, mosquitoes and that 
coral you stand on when you go in the ocean, all evolved from single-celled organisms. 
There’s a part of me that wants 
to say everyone can believe what-
ever he or she wants to believe, but the truth of it is, the study of evolution spans religions, cultures and belief systems. Which leads me to 
my last argument.
The one-third of Americans who don’t be-
lieve in evolution may feel this way because of 
their allegiance to God and intelligent design. There is a modern stigma that you either have to only believe in science or only believe in re-ligion. This is not true. 
Evolution should not be seen as a barrier 
to religious beliefs. Belief systems are not di-
chotomous, but rather spectrums. Science and 
religion can coexist. You can still believe in the Divine and also be a supporter of science. No-body has the right to take your religion away from you. Just be sure you don’t develop ig-norance to the progressing world. And if you do not believe in a religion, then let those who do, be. 
Whether you believe in God or the Flying 
Spaghetti Monster, my advice is to remain educated and to respect every individual’s viewpoint. 
I think it’s far past the time that our view-
points on this issue should have evolved. Wouldn’t you agree?

LAND O’LAKES, Fla. — A Tampa 
Bay-area man shot and killed during a 
dispute over texting at a movie theater 
is being remembered as a family man 
and fun-loving friend.
More than 300 mourners attended 
the funeral Saturday for Chad Oulson, 
requiring ushers to bring out folding 
chairs and open the choir loft at the Land O’Lakes Church of God.
“The world lost a great guy,” said 
neighbor Saverio Mongelli. “He was 
funny, respectful, energetic about 
life.”
Oulson’s wife was shot in the hand 
during the dispute at the Pasco Coun-ty theater. She did not speak at the fu-neral, but she hugged mourners with her left hand heavily bandaged.
In a statement last week, Nicole 
Oulson’s lawyers said she was “griev-ing the death of her husband” and comforting the couple’s 22-month-old daughter.
Retired police officer Curtis Reeves 
has been charged with second-degree 
murder and held without bail in the 
shooting.
Pasco County Sheriff’s officials say Reeves initially asked Oulson to stop texting. Friends have said Oulson was texting his daughter’s caregiver.
According to a sheriff’s office re-
port, Reeves spoke to Oulson during the movie previews, then got up and informed management. When Reeves returned to his seat, “additional words 
were exchanged,” and Oulson threw a 
bag of popcorn at Reeves.
Reeves told investigators that Oul-
son struck him in the face with an 
unknown object, and that’s when he 
removed a gun from his pants pocket. The report said Reeves fired the gun and struck Oulson once in the chest and that he “was in fear of being at-
tacked.”8, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, JANUARY 21, 2014

With tuition on the rise, some UF stu-
dents have opted for a nontraditional 
method of funding their academic costs.
UF was ranked No. 21 by SeekingAr-
rangement.com on its list of the fastest-growing sugar baby schools in the United 
States. 
SeekingArrangement.com calls itself 
the world’s largest sugar daddy website, 
with college students making up the ma-
jority of its users.
The website invites “gentlemen” to 
date and financially sponsor “sugar ba-
bies,” who are described as “attractive, in-telligent, ambitious and goal-oriented” by 
the website.Recent increases in tuition have led 
to students using sugar daddies to cover 
those costs, said Angela Bermudo, pub-lic relations manager at SeekingArrange-ment.com.
“Students need to find ways to pay for 
their tuition,” Bermudo said. “It’s a good career move while you’re still in school.”
In 2012, UF had 186 students using the 
service, she said. 
That number rose by about 57 percent 
in 2013. 
Currently 292 students at UF have sugar 
daddies paying for their school expenses.
Bermudo said that increased popular-
ity is due to “word of mouth between stu-dents.”
While the number of sugar babies is 
growing at UF and across the nation, not all students see the benefits of getting a sugar daddy.
Alexa Tsongranis, a 20-year-old UF psy-
chology and advertising sophomore, said she was surprised that her school ranked No. 21 on this list.
“My father would kill me first,” said 
Tsongrani. “If I needed the money that bad, I would get a job.” 
Rachel Reardon, a 22-year-old UF mul-
timedia journalism graduate student, said 
she thinks that a website like this is use-
ful.
“I feel like a lot of people would say its 
sexist, but it’s a woman exercising her own 
choice to take an option that is out there,” 
Reardon said.
Reardon said people are using this web-
site because college is very expensive.
“I’m incredibly broke, so that sounds 
good,” Reardon said jokingly. “What’s the 
name of the website again?” UF ranks No. 21 on list of fastest-growing sugar baby schools

TAMPA — New York Yankees shortstop 
Derek Jeter has resumed on-field work for the 
first time since his 2013 season was cut short.
The Yankees captain hit off a tee in a batting 
cage and fielded 108 grounders on the grass in front of the infield dirt Monday at the Yankees minor league complex.
Jeter, who turns 40 in June, was limited to 17 
games last year after breaking an ankle during the 2012 playoffs.
“I don’t think about it, and that’s a good 
thing,” Jeter said.
Jeter broke his left ankle Oct. 13, 2012, dur-
ing the AL championship series opener against Detroit. He was limited to five games and 11 at-bats during spring training last year, stayed 
behind in Florida when the team broke camp 
for rehabilitation and broke the ankle again in April during rehabilitation.
“It’s good to have a normal offseason and 
get some work in,” Jeter said. “Everything is 
normal now.”
Jeter missed the first 91 games of the 2013 
season, then felt pain in his right quadriceps 
when he returned July 11. He went back on 
the DL, returned July 28 for three games, then 
strained his right calf.
Back in the lineup on Aug. 26, he played 
through Sept. 7, when he left for a pinch runner after singling against Boston. While scans of the 
left ankle were negative, the Yankees said four 
days later his season was over. Jeter wound up hitting .190 (12 for 63) with one homer and sev-en RBIs, playing 13 games at shortstop and four 
at designated hitter.
Jeter normally begins baseball activities in 
mid-Janaury in preparation for spring training.
Yankees pitchers, catchers and injured play-
ers start workouts Feb. 15, with the rest of the team beginning five days later.Post-injury Derek

Florida airport wants to in-
stall artiﬁ  cial turf to deter 
birds from hanging around 
the planes.
Sanford International 
Airport ofﬁ  cials say birds 
cause problems for dozens of 
planes each year. One jet had to make an emergency land-ing after a bird ﬂ  ew into one of its engines.In 2012, the Federal Avia-

eter approach.
Ofﬁ  cials say artiﬁ  cial turf 
doesn’t retain water or food, 
so the birds won’t want to

Indecisive restaurant-goers now 
have an eatery in Gainesville with 
a menu that takes the hassle out of choosing. 
Five Bar opened last week in the 
former Smokehouse location at 104 S. Main St. It features a menu with only ﬁ  ve snacks, ﬁ  ve entrees and 
ﬁ  ve drinks from ﬁ  ve different cat-
egories of alcohol. 
The new location is the fourth in 
the restaurant family that also has locations in Tuscaloosa, Birming-ham and Athens.
Each location has menu offer-
ings that are unique to its city. For example, the Gainesville restaurant offers a glazed shrimp dish while the Tuscaloosa restaurant serves ol-ive cheese bites.
“We like to keep it simple, but 
we like to keep it good at the same time,” said server Kim Vacca, a 
21-year-old UF sustainability and 
the built environment senior.
Five Bar co-founder Charles Morgan opened his ﬁ  rst restau-rant, Harbor Docks, in Destin, said Gainesville Five Bar general man-
ager Ben Janca.
This kind of dining started in 
2011 in Tuscaloosa, Janca said. Own-
ers wanted to simplify the menu for their patrons. 
The company also has a charity 
program called American Lunch, which has a food truck that travels around to different cities to feed the homeless, Janca said.  
The restaurant lets the food and 
the atmosphere speak for itself, he said.
“We put together what we think 
is a cool place that’s eye-appealing. Then you walk in, and you have this atmosphere and this meal that’s not typical,” he said about the restau-rant, decorated with chandeliers, 
an open-wood ceiling and local art-
work. 
Its location in downtown 
Gainesville gives the restaurant the best diversity of people, he added.
“There are always … city ofﬁ  -
cials, young professionals, doctors, lawyers, service industry workers  and everything in between,” Janca 
wrote in an email. “We try to make 
a common ground that everyone en-joys and can take part of.”
Janca said the restaurant also 
offers a New Orleans-style brunch with a live jazz band playing every Sunday from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.
Courtney Lehan, a 19-year-old 
UF health science sophomore, said 
she decided to visit the restaurant 
when she went downtown for din-ner. Lehan said she enjoyed her en-tree: bacon-wrapped shrimp stuffed with crabmeat.
“The food here is worth the risk 
of trying a new restaurant,” Lehan said.Restaurant brings options to downtown

Florida picked up a

   Prior to Florida’s 68-61 win at 
Auburn on Saturday, coach Bil-
ly Donovan listed Casey Prather 
as active but doubted his senior 
forward would play much.  The original plan was to 
have Prather, who had missed Florida’s last two contests with a bone bruise in his right knee, come off the bench and log lim-
ited minutes. 
  But after he saw Prather 
moving well and dominating offensively against the Tigers in the ﬁ  rst half, Donovan made a 
different call. 
  “I told our team before the 
game that, with him being back, 
we’re not going to put pressure 
on him for him to come back to the form he was at maybe a week or two ago, just because 
his rhythm and those type of 
things,” Donovan said. 
  “But that all went out of the 
window at the end of the ﬁ  rst 
half when he had 16 (points), so 
he was clearly going to play a lot more minutes.”
  Prather ﬁ  nished with 21 
points on 8-of-10 shooting, a 
5-of-7 clip from the free-throw 
line and six rebounds in 29 min-utes off the bench. He was quick off his step against Auburn and 
did not look hampered by his 
injury 
  “My knee felt great,” Prather 
said. “I didn’t really notice any pain at all.”
  Prather subbed into the 
game about three minutes into the ﬁ  rst half and immediately made an impact. On his ﬁ  rst of-fensive possession, the 6-foot-6 senior took a feed from Patric 
Young down the lane and sunk 
a hook shot.

By now, you’ve probably read 
about or listened to Seattle Seahawks cornerback Richard 
Sherman’s controversial postgame comments following his team’s 23-17 win in the NFC Championship over the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday 
night. 
 If not, how 
comfy is that 
rock you’ve been hiding 
under?
  For those 
who don’t 
know, Sher-
man went on 
an epic rampage during his postgame 
interview with FOX sideline reporter Erin Andrews after the biggest play of his career — a deﬂ  ection of a pass 
intended for 49ers receiver Michael 
Crabtree in the end zone that fell into the hands of Seattle linebacker Mal-colm Smith to seal to game. 
When Andrews asked Sherman af-
ter the game’s deﬁ  ning play, he went off the tracks.
  Sherman labeled himself as “the 
best corner in the game” and rubbed a 
container’s worth of Morton Salt into 
Crabtree’s wounds, calling his nem-esis a “sorry receiver.” 
“Don’t you ever talk about me,” 
Sherman exclaimed, referring to Crab-tree. 
Then, Andrews followed up by ask-
ing: “Who was talking about you?”
 And Sherman kept going.  “Crabtree,” Sherman said. “Don’t 
you open your mouth about the best, 
or I’m going to shut it for you real 
quick.”
  Sherman then ended his interview 
by shouting “L.O.B.,” an acronym for the Seahawks defense’s nickname Le-
gion of Boom. 
  Seconds following Sherman’s com-
ments, social media unsurprisingly 
exploded, and plenty of hate was di-
rected Sherman’s way. Sherman

   Rebounding and foul trouble are again 
leading the Gators down a dark path. 
  In Sunday’s 68-62 loss to Georgia, Flor-
ida was taken to the woodshed, getting 
outrebounded by a margin of 20 — the second straight game in which the Gators were outrebounded by 20 or more.
  “Obviously, we’re very disappointed 
in the way we played in the second half and the way that we rebounded the entire game, but that’s just our battle to ﬁ  ght,” coach Amanda Butler said. 
  “We’re obviously giving up a little 
bit of size and that’s what makes the box outs that much more important. Winning the rebounding battle is important, but as long as it’s close, it’s always going to swing one way or the other … I was just really disappointed. I thought there were a lot of hustle-play balls, long rebounds and things like that that we could have tracked down. They did a really good job of converting those balls into points. That’s something that we put in the cat-egory of preventable plays.”
  Added senior 
Jaterra Bonds: “Ultimately, it was the second-chance points and points off of turn-
overs. They had 16 points off of turn-overs and 22 second-chance points, and they killed us in both categories.”
  The Gators’ leading rebounder on 
Sunday was freshman Ronni Williams, who tallied eight boards. Williams was on her way to a double-double until she fouled out with fewer than ﬁ  ve minutes remaining in the game. 
  Down the stretch, Williams’ pres-
ence was missed. The Gators were out-rebounded 11-3 in the game’s ﬁ  nal ﬁ  ve minutes. 
  All of Florida’s (13-5, 3-2 Southeastern 
Conference) losses have come when Wil-liams fouls out. She has fouled out of 11 games so far this season. 
  The Gators were in the lead for the 
majority of Sunday’s contest, which can be directly attributed to the 18 turnovers Georgia committed in the ﬁ  rst half. In that span, Florida committed nine. 
  “Florida came out and jumped on us, 
and we didn’t handle it well,” Georgia coach Andy Landers said. “It affected our pass-catch timing and shot selection and

  Two weeks into the 2014 gym-
nastics season, the Gators have 
already begun the uphill battle toward improvement. Florida improved to 2-0 after a road win against Auburn on Friday night, winning 197.075-196.225. 
  “They competed more aggres-
sively,” coach Rhonda Faehn said. “Especially, I feel they had more energy.”
  UF’s score against Auburn 
was .425 higher than the 196.65 the team posted against UCLA during the season opener on Jan. 11. With the victory, UF climbed from a tie for fourth to the No. 3 in 
the national team rankings. Okla-
homa and LSU are ahead of UF at No. 1 and No. 2, respectively. 
  Florida’s improvements were 
not only seen at the team level; in-dividuals such as senior Macken-zie Caquatto also made strides in the second meet of the year.
  After receiving one of the 
worst scores in Florida history against UCLA in ﬂ  oor (8.40), Ca-quatto turned around to win the balance beam (9.95) event against Auburn.
  “She was thrilled,” Faehn said. 
“That’s what she’s really capable of doing. She just really lit up the ﬂ  oor.
“Last week was ﬂ  uky … it was 
nice to see her rebound.”
  Caquatto, who competed in 
all-around at UCLA, participated in every event except ﬂ  oor against Auburn.
  “She put in great routines; we 
could have easily competed her,” Faehn said. “We felt we maybe 
overwhelmed her in the ﬁ  rst 
meet.”
  Caquatto’s 9.925 on vault tied 
her collegiate best, which she set on Feb. 22, 2013, in a home meet against Kentucky. Faehn said her vault Friday was the best she has ever seen from Caquatto.
  “I feel we were more conﬁ  dent 
[Saturday],” Caquatto said in a release. 
“We had the ﬁ  rst meet of the 
season behind us … We were re-ally loud and having fun. When we have fun, that’s when we do our best. The energy was high and 
that helped us perform our best.”
  Sophomore Bridget Sloan also 
tied her collegiate best on vault 
with a 9.95. Sloan secured wins in both uneven bars (9.925) and all-around (39.700).
  “Her performance [Saturday] 
was on par with where she was at the national championship,” 
Faehn said.
  Freshman Silvia Colussi-Pe-
laez competed for the ﬁ  rst time 
with the Gators. Colussi-Pelaez exhibitioned ﬂ  oor (9.60) and un-even bars (9.125), where she took a fall against UCLA. However, she improved to a 9.725 on ﬂ  oor in Auburn, Ala.
  “She did well enough at 
UCLA,” Faehn said. “She trained really well, so we wanted to give her the opportunity.”
  Claire Boyce, Florida’s other 
freshman, competed for the sec-ond time in both balance beam and ﬂ  oor.
  While her balance beam re-
mained consistent with what she posted against UCLA (9.85), Boyce’s ﬂ  oor routine lost some spark between California and Ala-bama. A fall during her ﬂ  oor rou-tine turned the 9.825 she scored against UCLA into a meet low of 9.125 on ﬂ  oor.
  “That was an odd fall on ﬂ  oor; 
that was unusual for her and I’m sure she’s not happy with it,” Faehn said. 
“Falls can be positive because 
you have to learn from [them].” 14, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, JANUARY 21, 2014

  Three-star prospect Deiondre 
Porter out of Tampa Jefferson 
High verbally committed to UF 
on Monday night. 
  Porter received an offer from 
Florida last week, and as a result, 
he decommitted from USF. He 
took his ofﬁ  cial visit to Gainesville 
last weekend and chose UF over USF, UCF and Miami. 
  After Porter’s decision, UF’s 
2014 class has 22 commits. The 
class is currently ranked seventh 
in the country, according to Ri-vals.com. 
Barring further attrition, the 
Gators have four more scholar-ships available. 
  Final rankings released: Ri-
vals released its ﬁ  nal top 100 play-er rankings for 2014 on Monday. 
UF’s class currently has four com-
mits in the rankings, including quarterback Will Grier, defensive tackle Thomas Holley, defensive 
end Gerald Willis III and corner-
back Jalen Tabor.
  The rankings have several UF 
targets in them as well. 
Florida State verbal commit Treon Harris took an ofﬁ  cial visit to Florida this weekend. 
Harris is the third-ranked du-
al-threat quarterback in the 2014 class, and he will receive an in-home visit from coach Will Mus-champ on Tuesday. 
  Five-star athlete Adoree’ Jack-
son is the No. 6 recruit on the list. Jackson has offers from Florida State, Oregon, LSU and others. 
Jackson could wind up at UF be-
cause of its powerhouse track pro-gram, which has won ﬁ  ve titles in three seasons. 
  Jackson is highly interested in pursuing a track 
career while at-
tending college. 
He currently does not have any ofﬁ  cial vis-its scheduled for 
the rest of the 
month. 
  Offensive tackle Damian Prince 
is the No. 20 prospect in the ﬁ  nal 
100, and  running backs coach Bri-
an White visited him last week. 
Prince took an ofﬁ  cial visit to 
South Carolina this past weekend, and he will take his ﬁ  nal ofﬁ  cial visit to Gainesville on Jan. 31 — just ﬁ  ve days before National 
Signing Day. Prince is the No. 2 
offensive tackle recruit in the 2014 class. 
Defensive end   Lorenzo Carter, 
the No. 36 prospect in the nation, 
is the last UF target in the ﬁ  nal 100 
ranking. Carter visited LSU this weekend, and he will take his last ofﬁ  cials to FSU and Georgia. 
New UGA defensive coordina-
tor Jeremy Pruitt, hired from FSU last week, could have an advan-tage having recruited him while in Tallahassee.

it led to 18 turnovers in the first 
half. That was ugly. That was re-ally ugly. The second half, we did a much better job of that. By vir-tue of taking care of the ball, we had opportunities to shoot and score and overcome the lead.”
And when the Bulldogs 
cleaned up, the Gators wilted, getting outscored 44-32 in the second half. 
“You have to give Georgia a lot 
of credit for the way they played, the way they shot the ball,” Butler said. “They did some things that were a little bit outside of their 
scouting report and what they’ve 
done to this point. You have to 
give them a lot of credit for hit-ting big shots, making plays and 
taking advantage of the things 
where we had weaknesses where 
they were very strong.”
Georgia was sharp from be-
yond the arc on Sunday, shooting 
36.4 percent compared to Flori-
da’s 21.4 percent. 
The Gators had a better over-
all shooting percentage, com-mitted less turnovers and forced more steals on Sunday, but the 
Bulldogs bested them the char-
ity stripe and, ultimately, on the 
scoreboard. 
“For us, which is what we’re 
most concerned with, we just need to put together 40 min-
utes of tough play with no gaps 
in that toughness,” Butler said. 
“Nobody is going to play flaw-
less, but we’ve got to have a lot 
more battle and a lot more heart 
and the way we pursue the ball is really, really important. But, 
you’re also playing in the SEC, in the best league in the country and you don’t have much time to sit around and cry about this one because there’s another big one that’s coming. That’s just life at this time of year.”
about it at that moment, but 
I’m glad it went in,” Prather said. 
“At the same time, I was 
just trying to stay humble and not rush things or try to do too much.”
In his first 10 minutes on 
the floor, Prather went 5-of-5 shooting for 14 points as the then-No. 7 Gators (15-2, 4-0 Southeastern Conference) led 
by 13 points.
Although Prather went qui-
et offensively during the final 
five minutes of Saturday’s con-test, his performance early put 
Florida in a position to win. 
Frazier struggles in victory:  
A game after his career scoring 
night, sophomore guard Mi-chael Frazier II finished with 
perhaps his worst shooting 
performance as a Gator. 
Frazier followed up his 
21-point performance on 
7-of-16 shooting in Florida’s 
72-50 win against Georgia on Tuesday with a scoreless af-fair Saturday against Auburn. 
The sophomore missed both of 
his three-point attempts in the first half and committed two turnovers in only 19 minutes on the floor.
During the game’s final 6:08, 
Frazier logged only 28 seconds on the court as the team went with a backcourt lineup fea-
turing point guards Kasey Hill 
and Scottie Wilbekin.
“He’s got to find different 
ways to move,” Donovan said. “He’s got to be able to play the game without shooting it. We 
tried to do some things to get 
him some shots. 
“The first shot was an air-
ball and the second shot he missed. And then, you could just see that he was mentally taken out of the game. He’s got to realize that he can’t play the game waiting for his next shot. 
He’s done such a good job de-
fensively for us really all year long, but this is a game where I thought he had some lapses 
defensively and really had a 
hard time defending. 
“But as a young guy and 
a sophomore, understanding when coming off a big game, 
you almost have to be that 
much more mentally prepared, because you know you’re go-ing to see another team’s best 
because they’re not going to let 
you take that many threes.”  TUESDAY, JANUARY 21, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15

Seattle cornerback Richard Sherman (25) hits the ball away from San Francisco receiver 
Michael Crabtree (15) during the NFC Championship game on Sunday in Seattle.
Postgame interview showed 
cornerback’s passion, intensity
In an instant, he became a villain — and 
Twitter became a Denver Broncos fan.
But I don’t get why people are vilifying 
Sherman. Although his postgame remarks 
were wild and somewhat uncivilized, they were incredibly refreshing. 
How could you not love an athlete for ex-
pressing his raw emotion after possibly the biggest moment of his entire career?
In most postgame interviews, clichés 
and contrived messages such as “take it one game at a time” and “just played hard for 
my teammates” are go-tos for athletes. Even 
some athletes who accomplish outstanding achievements, like winning Super Bowls or NBA titles, fall back on these empty re-
sponses when the buzzer sounds and the 
microphones and recorders are held to their faces.
At least Sherman tried to spice it up Sun-
day. You have to respect him for at least do-
ing that.
Unfortunately, many people now are go-
ing to jump on the We Hate Richard Sher-
man Bandwagon, and for a poor reason. The 
third-year corner out of Stanford has always 
been outspoken, and that quality has never adversely affected him or his team. 
We’re talking about a guy who once told 
Skip Bayless on live television, “I’m better at life than you,” after the First Take host ques-
tioned Sherman’s claim that he’s the best 
player in the league at his position. (Sure, that’s mean, but he may have a point.)
At least Sherman has backed up his 
cocky demeanor with his play during the past few seasons. I’m all for fiery comments that won’t hurt team morale or chemistry in the long run. If his teammates don’t have a problem with them, I don’t.
Monday, Sherman apologized for the 
remarks and attacking Crabtree. But we all know somebody in his ear told him what to say.
Regardless, what happened in the heat 
of the moment will forever live on and rep-resent Sherman’s natural emotions after his team’s win. That’s why I love it when a guy like Sherman says something eye-popping 
but not too explicit or inappropriate during 
a postgame interview. 
You can’t criticize Sherman for being 
himself — especially when emotions are 
high after a big game.
As Sherman would say, “stop [complain -
ing] and [just] adapt.”Column , from page 13

San Francisco 49ers’ Colin Kaepernick fumbles as he is hit by Seattle Seahawks’ Cliff 
Avril during the second half of the NFC Championship game Sunday in Seattle.  JORDAN MCPHERSON
 Alligator Writer @J_McPheson1126
  Dan Quinn has proved to be 
the 12th man for the Seahawks 
in his ﬁ  rst season as Seattle’s defensive coordinator.
  The ﬁ  rst-year Seahawks 
coach’s defense forced 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick into committing three turn-overs late in Sunday’s game as Seattle punched its way into Su-per Bowl XLVIII with its 23-17 victory against San Francisco in the NFC Championship game.
  Quinn, Florida’s defensive 
coordinator from 2011-12, saw his defensive unit continue the dominance it displayed all sea-son, limiting San Francisco to 12 or fewer yards on seven of its 11 drives on Sunday.
  After a back-and-forth game 
through the ﬁ  rst three quarters, the Seahawks took their ﬁ  rst 
lead of the game with 13:44 left 
on the clock. Quinn’s defense took control from there.  With the 49ers down by 
three points and fewer than eight minutes left in the game, Kaepernick threw a pass in-tended for receiver Anquan Boldin that was intercepted by 
Seattle safety Kam Chancellor.
The Seahawks   would take 
four minutes off the clock and 
kick a ﬁ  eld goal on the ensuing possession to widen their lead to 23-17 with 3:37 remaining.
  With one chance left to win 
the game, Kaepernick looked poised. He orchestrated an 
eight-play, 60-yard drive to 
bring the 49ers to the Seahawks’ 18-yard line. 
  But with 30 seconds left on 
the clock, Kaepernick dropped back and threw a deep pass to the right side of the endzone, looking for Michael Crabtree. Cornerback Richard Sherman 
deﬂ  ected the pass into the arms 
of linebacker Malcolm Smith, effectively ending the game.
  Since Quinn returned to 
the Seahawks after serving as their defensive line coach in 2009 and 2010, Seattle’s defense has improved in almost ev-ery statistical category. When the regular season ended, the Seahawks ranked ﬁ  rst in total 
yards (273.6) and total passing 
yards (172.0) allowed per game; they also led the NFL with 39 turnovers — eight more than they forced in 2012.
  While working at Florida 
in between stints with Seattle, Quinn led the Gators to a top-10 ranking in total defense and 
scoring defense in both 2011 
and 2012. The Gators gave up an average of 293.1 yards per game and 17.4 points per game during the two years he helmed the defense, numbers that in-creased this season to 314.3 and 21.1, respectively, for Florida.
  During Quinn’s tenure at 
UF, opposing defenses con-verted only 29.1 percent of their third-down attempts; that number increased to 34 percent in 2013.

  With two dual meets remaining this 
season and the Southeastern Conference 
Championships a month away for the No. 3 Florida men (6-0, 3-0 SEC) and No. 8 women (4-2, 2-1 SEC), the season’s last 
head-to-head matchups are being used to 
gauge how Florida’s swimmers are racing and what ﬁ  nal adjustments are needed.
  “The two dress rehearsal meets at the 
end of the month will be real key for us: competing against Auburn here … at home and going to Tennessee,” coach Gregg Troy said. 
“Both those meets’ start times are the 
same times as the prelims at the NCAA and SEC meets, so it gives us a great chance to see how those folks will respond in good 
competition early in the day.”
  However, Troy stressed that the results 
from Florida’s next two meets are not draw-
ing his focus, making it clear he is sternly set on the conference championship on Feb. 18 and national championship on March 27.   He said nobody would remember the 
dual meets by the time SECs come around. But he is not letting his swimmers take those competitions easy.
  “Now, if we get 
someone qualiﬁ  ed at the meet, that’s real big. So, we’ve 
got a few people that haven’t qualiﬁ  ed,” Troy said. “And if you’re qualiﬁ  ed, then 
your preparation for the conference meet 
is a little different than your preparation if you haven’t qualiﬁ  ed.”
  The Gators have notched eight men’s 
and 13 women’s NCAA “A” cuts across 13 different events, including every relay ex-cept the men’s 200-yard freestyle relay and 200-yard medley relay, guaranteeing those 
swimmers and relay squads a spot in the 
NCAA Championships.
  Senior Elizabeth Beisel has notched four 
“A” cuts — including one relay — leading the team for most individual qualiﬁ  cations at three. But with sophomore Sinead Russel and senior Ellse Zalewski swimming on all ﬁ  ve relays, the duo totals the most qualiﬁ  -cations for the Gators with seven and six, 
respectively.
  On the men’s side, the powerhouse duo 
of senior Marcin Cieslak and redshirt senior 
Sebastien Rousseau continue to succeed with the postseason nearing. Rousseau and Cieslak both have four total “A” cuts to go with senior Brad deBorde’s two.
