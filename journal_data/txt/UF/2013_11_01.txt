Jordan Reed lost his grip on a day when the 
Gators lost theirs.
Cruising through a resurgent second season 
under coach Will Muschamp, Florida headed to 
Jacksonville undefeated at 7-0 and ranked sec-ond behind Alabama in the BCS standings.
Muschamp had UF in play for its third crys-
tal football in seven seasons thanks to a renewed focus on dominating the ground game, playing tough defense and winning the turnover battle.
But in Florida’s tightest contest of the season, 
they came unraveled.
Six of the Gators’ 15 turnovers in 2012 ended 
up in the hands of Bulldogs. Meanwhile, Geor-gia controlled the ground game on the strength of Todd Gurley’s 118 rushing yards on 27 car-ries.
Gurley was the only player to eclipse the 
100-yard mark against the nation’s fourth-ranked rushing defense in 2012. Florida’s other 12 opponents averaged only 93.8 yards on the ground.
On the other side of the ball, the Gators’ stout 
running game faltered.
Mike Gillislee, who entered the game ranked 
fourth in the Southeastern Conference with 652 rushing yards in seven games, tallied only 77 yards on 22 carries. The rest of Florida’s offense lost two yards on the ground, a number hurt by ﬁ  ve sacks that cost the Gators 40 yards.
Still, Florida had a chance.Trailing 17-9 with 2:21 remaining, quarter-
back Jeff Driskel found the sure hands of his most reliable pass-catcher in one-on-one cover-age at the 16-yard line. Reed, who fumbled just once in his ﬁ  nal two seasons at UF, caught the pass, broke a tackle and set his sights on the end zone.
Once he reached the 5-yard line, he went air-
borne. Reed landed at the 1, but the ball kept going.
That one fumble.Reed lay where he landed, staring into the 
black sky. In a game full of mistakes, his was last.
His was ﬁ  nal.But Reed did not lose the game alone. Florida’s ﬁ  nal scoring chance seemed, if 
anything, fortunate. The Gators did not play well enough to win. They had not played Mus-champ’s brand of football. 
 And it cost them not only that one game, but 
also their most important goal: the Southeastern Conference Championship Game in Atlanta.
Maybe even more.“That was the one loss that separated us from 
going to SEC Championship, getting to play in the national championship,” linebacker Michael Taylor said. “That’s the one thing that stood in between us and all those goals. So we owe them some payback. Saturday will be interesting.”
�    �             � 
Great rivalries have transcendent elements. 
For Florida-Georgia, it is crossing the Hart Bridge.
“There’s no question that when you come 
over that bridge, it charges you up,” Muschamp said in 2011, prior to his ﬁ  rst game in the rivalry as Florida’s coach. “I get goose bumps talking about it.”
Muschamp, who played at UGA from 1991 
to 1994, has crossed the bridge representing both teams.
After growing up in Gainesville and root-
ing for the Gators, Muschamp and his family moved to Rome, Ga.
A broken leg suffered during his senior year 
at Rome Darlington School deterred recruiters. He ended up walking on at Georgia, trading in his orange and blue for red and black.
“He just willed it in his mind that he was go-
ing to play for us,” former Bulldogs defensive coordinator Richard Bell said. “All those intan-gibles that are so necessary to have to take your talent to another level, he possessed.”
Muschamp endeared himself to the coach-
ing staff through his hard work. Bell, who coached at Georgia from 1989 to 1993, used to tease Muschamp leading up to the rivalry game each season.
“I knew he had a Gator background,” Bell 
said. “I would kid him about, ‘What’s going to happen?’ And he would say, ‘Coach, I’m a ‘Dawg now.’”
But the fun always ended once he crossed 
the Hart Bridge.
Five times Muschamp has left Jacksonville a 
loser in the Florida-Georgia rivalry. He suffered a sixth loss when the Bulldogs fell to the Gators at Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium in 1994.
Muschamp said his two coaching losses 
sting more, but he didn’t discount his younger self’s misery.
“None of it is fun,” he said.Especially when the game doesn’t break 
your way. Like 2012. And 1993.
During Muschamp’s junior year, Georgia 
had a chance to upend Steve Spurrier and Flor-ida.
With Muschamp in the secondary, the Bull-
dogs limited the Gators to a season-low 142 passing yards on a rain-soaked day.
“It rained and rained and rained,” Bell re-
called.
But on the strength of 183 rushing yards from 
Errict Rhett, Florida carried a 33-26 lead into the game’s ﬁ  nal minutes. After a 26-24 loss in 1992, it was again a one-score game.
Again, Georgia had a chance.With ﬁ  ve seconds remaining on the clock, 
Bulldogs quarterback Eric Zeier found Jerry Jer-man in the end zone for what appeared to be the game-tying touchdown.
But Gators cornerback Anthone Lott called a 
timeout just before the ball was snapped.
Georgia ended up getting two more chances. 
Lott committed pass interference on the next play, and Zeier’s last attempt fell incomplete, dealing Muschamp the third of four losses.
All he could do was watch.“We felt like we sure had a chance to win,” 
Bell said. “It depends on who you talk to, wheth-er you’re talking to a Georgia guy or a Florida gal on that timeout. It was a heck of a game, I know that. We had a heartbreaker from the year before in ‘92. They were good; we were good.
“Two good ball games that we felt like we 
could have won. Unfortunately, we didn’t. That’s this series. It continues to be as far as a rivalry is concerned.”
�    �             � 
What was once known as the “World’s Larg-
est Outdoor Cocktail Party” is now the “World’s Largest Outdoor Pity Party.” The injury bug has taken a toll on both the championship stakes and the NFL talent usually on display in the Florida-Georgia rivalry.
For just the second time since 1979, both 
Florida and Georgia enter Saturday’s game unranked. Each is also currently mired in a two-game losing streak and risks slipping out of contention in the SEC Eastern Division with another defeat.
Injuries to players on either side of the rivalry 
have contributed to the sudden mediocrity.
Gurley, who shredded Florida’s defense as a 
freshman, missed three games this season after suffering a sprained ankle against LSU on Sept. 28. The Bulldogs lost two of the three games dur-ing his absence and had to escape with an over-time victory against Tennessee in the other. 
Malcolm Mitchell, Justin Scott-Wesley and 
Keith Marshall, three cogs in Georgia’s offense, are out for the season after each suffered ACL tears during the season.
“We’re not feeling sorry for ourselves,” 
Georgia coach Mark Richt said. “I doubt Florida is feeling sorry for themselves.”
But the Gators have felt similar pain.Florida is without starting quarterback Jeff 
Driskel, who suffered a season-ending fracture of his ﬁ  bula against Tennessee on Sept. 21. Also done for the year is Matt Jones, who was UF’s leading rusher when he suffered a torn menis-cus against LSU on Oct. 12, and Dominique Eas-ley, the anchor of the defensive line. In total, the Gators have lost eight players, including ﬁ  ve starters, for the season. 
“It’s part of the game,” Muschamp said. “In-
juries are a part of it. You strap up with who you have and you move forward.”
�    �             �
Muschamp has steadfastly refused the 
thought of one game being more important than the rest.
“I hate to give you the boring answer,” he said, “but I don’t approach this one any differ-ent than the other ones.”
But for him to truly move forward while at 
Florida, beating Georgia is a critical step.
His three predecessors — Steve Spurrier, 
Ron Zook and Urban Meyer — kept the rivalry on a short leash, going 18-3 against the Bulldogs from 1990-2010.
Muschamp has been vocal about expecting 
to enjoy similar success.
“It’s not going to be a long winning streak, 
I can assure you,” he told reporters prior to a Gator Gathering at the Jacksonville Fairgrounds during the offseason. “We feel very comfort-able.”
But ﬁ  nding the success he has spoken about 
has proven difﬁ  cult, and he might begin to feel less comfortable if another loss compounds an already disappointing season for the Gators.
“Georgia is always the biggest game of the 
year, no matter how good we are or how good they are,” Trey Burton said. 
Even with SEC title implications on the back 
burner, the rivalry remains heated. In a battle between neighboring states, the close proximity keeps it that way.
Michael Taylor wants to win this one for his 
mother, an Atlanta native.
She told him, “Y’all have to beat them this 
year because I don’t want to have to hear about it from supervisors, because all the supervisors went to Georgia.”
Taylor hopes to give his mother bragging 
rights at the water cooler.
“I have even more motivation to win this 
game,” he said, “so my mom ain’t got to hear about it for the next 365 days of the year.”
Muschamp has been on both sides of the ri-
valry. He knows how it feels as a Bulldog. He knows how it feels as a Gator.
Now, he wants to know what it feels like as 
a winner.
“It’s a critical game for us, obviously being a 
great rival with the University of Florida and a great rivalry game,” Muschamp said. “It’s one of the best college football games, year in, year out, to be a part of.”

Punk rockers have descended upon Gainesville as they do this 
time every year, but Fest 12 comes with a few changes.
Fest venues collectively raised the price of Pabst Blue Ribbon 
beer from $2 to $3. The same was true for venues during pre-Fest 
in Ybor City.
Tony Weinbender, Fest’s organizer, said the hike wasn’t an is-
sue at pre-Fest.
“Nobody cares,” he said.It seems that sentiment carried over to Gainesville, too.Lily Nelson, a 19-year-old UF psychology sophomore, said she 
thinks the price change won’t shake things up too much.
“A lot of people drink PBR here,” she said. “But they will prob-
ably just pay for it anyway.”
Robbie Bersano, 25-year-old front house staff for the Blue Man 
Group, said the change in price doesn’t affect him.
“Blasphemy,” he said. “I’m from Chicago, so a $3 PBR in a 16-oz 
can is a steal. It’s nice. It’s part of the vacation. It’s not necessarily about getting wasted. It’s about hanging out with your friends.”
Anna Snyder, 24-year-old moderator for the Hufﬁ  ngton Post, 
said that cheap beer is not the priority — the music is.Fest 12 PBR price 
increases to $3

Students traveling to Jacksonville 
for Florida-Georgia game festivities 
this weekend have several options for parking and resources for a safe experience, ofﬁ  cials advise. 
Lauri-Ellen Smith, special assis-
tant to Jacksonville Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce, said underage drinking laws and open container laws will be strict-ly enforced. She also said people should avoid counterfeits by not buying tickets on the street.
“The Florida-Georgia game will 
be an exciting event, and following these simple tips will help them and us as well,” she said.
Park-n-Ride options are offered 
by the Jacksonville Transportation Authority’s stadium shuttle service. Residents and visitors can park in one of the complimentary locations and pay for a round-trip ride to Ev-erBank Field.Two downtown boarding loca-
tions are the Skyway Convention Center lot at 1005 Forsyth St. on the north bank of the river and the Kings Avenue Parking Garage at 1003 Kings Ave. on the south bank, both for $7 per person.
Customers driving from the 
beaches can park and board at Little League (Wingate) Park at 277 Pen-man Road South in Jacksonville Beach for $12 per person.
Visiting from the south side of the city, customers can board at the J. Turner Butler Boulevard and Phil-lips Highway at 7020 Phillips High-way for $12 per person.
Shuttle services will begin at 11:30 a.m. and will continue one hour after the game.
“Riding the shuttle is an easy 
way to avoid the hassle of heavy trafﬁ  c and a safer way to travel, es-pecially because it is somewhat of a party scene,” said John Finotti, JTA spokesman.
There are no particular areas to 
avoid, but having patience is key, he said.

Get the RVs and chemistry equipment ready, UF stu-
dents — Vince Gilligan, the creator of the award-winning 
television series “Breaking Bad,” is coming to campus.
The talk will begin Nov. 12 at 8 p.m. at the Phillips Cen-
ter for the Performing Arts. Tickets are free and open to the public and will be available to students at noon Nov. 11, and to the public at 5 p.m. the day of the event.
Daniel Landesberg, chairman of the Ac-
cent Speaker’s Bureau and 21-year-old UF telecommunication senior, said with the show’s recent ending, Gilligan was one of the bureau’s most popular requests.
He said Accent got four times the usual 
amount of responses on one of its online surveys, which asked, “Do you watch ‘Breaking Bad’?”
“It’s great for students just to see how his mind works,” 
Landesberg said. “He’s just the zenith of television writ-ing.”
Gilligan is being paid $60,000 to come to UF.Kyle Zins, a 21-year-old UF electrical engineering senior, 
said bringing Gilligan to campus was a good choice by Ac-cent. 
“I was a huge fan,” he said. “I think he did a really good 
job with the show.”Better call Vince: Accent to break bad with creator Gilligan SEE FL/GA, PAGE 4

In an effort to reduce theft on campus, 
the University Police now offers electronic 
bicycle registration.
“Bike theft and shoplifting drive our 
numbers way up,” said UPD Ofﬁ  cer Gra-ham Drnest. “It’s a big problem in this city. It happens more than we like to talk about because there are so many issues.”
Theft is the No. 1 crime problem at UF 
and bicycles are the main target, according to the UPD website.
Though bicycle thievery is common at 
UF, Drnest said it is probably more com-mon for students who live off campus. A majority of the thievery happens in resi-dents’ own backyards, he said.
Monica Barreneche, a 20-year-old UF ﬁ  -
nance junior, was a victim of bike thievery off campus. She said she was home during the theft.
One of the biggest problems with bi-
cycle thievery is victims typically do not know their bike’s serial number, Drnest said. He also attributes the thievery to stu-dents purchasing inexpensive locks and locking their bikes incorrectly. 
Residents can register by visiting the 
police department’s website at police.uﬂ  .edu and ﬁ  lling out personal and bicycle information. People who register will need to know a variety of information, includ-ing their bike’s serial number and sex.
The serial number is usually located 
under the frame.
To determine if a bike is male or female, 
look at the top bar on the bike, Drnest said. If it is lower then it is a female because the initial design prevented girls’ dresses ﬂ  y-ing up in the air.
“I was surprised at how many people 
actually did the online registry,” Drnest said.  
The UPD site suggests a few precautions 
people should take in avoiding bicycle thievery: secure a quality, hardened-steel U-type lock through the wheel, frame and rack;  park and lock bikes in well-lighted areas; and report theft immediately.Online bike registration added

Sunday at 2 a.m. will mark the begin-
ning of more darkness. But as Daylight 
Savings comes to end, more women could feel unsafe.
Stephanie Creamer, a 22-year-old UF 
master’s student in international business, said she loves when the time changes be-cause of the extra hour of sleep. But this means that it gets darker at an earlier time.
Creamer said she feels a little less safe 
on campus and while walking to her apart-ment when she is alone. She said most of her classes don’t end until 6 or 8 p.m., and after that, she attends group meetings that sometimes run as late as 11 p.m.
“Sometimes walking back is a little in-
timidating that late,” she said.
University Police spokesman Maj. Brad Barber said even though the time change means darkness approaches faster, crimes on campus don’t typically increase.
Walking in well-lit areas, walking with 
a friend or some other person, planning ahead and using the Student Nighttime Auxiliary Patrol service are all safety tips the police recommend, he said.
Kelsey Brown, a 20-year-old UF tele-

� IT HAS NOT ALL BEEN 
ACCOUNTED FOR.
KATHRYN VARN
Alligator Staff Writer kvarn@alligator.org
After several months of investiga-
tion, Gainesville Police arrested an em-
ployee accused of stealing more than $200,000 from the American Red Cross North Central Florida chapter.
Detectives ﬁ  led grand theft and 
scheme to defraud charges against 29-year-old Casey Marie Schmelz, of Gainesville, according to a release. 
In June, employees discovered a 
series of unauthorized transactions that linked back to Schmelz, formerly the emergency services manager of the chapter, according to the release. 
The chapter conducted an audit 
based on an anonymous tip, conﬁ  rm-ing about 60 instances of fraud. Ad-ministrators then ﬁ  red Schmelz, who had worked at the chapter for about ﬁ  ve years, according to the release.
She discovered the username and 
password of an employee with access to load money onto debit cards that are normally intended for disaster victims to buy food, clothing and other neces-sities. She used the login information to put money on cards and withdraw the cash from local ATMs. 
Since 2011, Schmelz has stolen  
$203,648.21, said GPD spokesman Ofﬁ  -cer Ben Tobias. She used the money for personal expenses, like bills, but not all the money has been accounted for.
In a statement, the American Red 
Cross declared the chapter was aware of the charges and would cooperate with police in the investigation. 
A sworn complaint was ﬁ  led to 
State Attorney’s ofﬁ  ce ofﬁ  cials, who will determine whether to pursue for-mal charges.Police: Woman embezzled 
$200k from Red CrossFest 12 has about 530 volunteers
Places like Flashbacks and 
Maude’s are advertising Fest 
specials of $2 PBR.
Steve Nichtberger, 54-year-
old owner of Flashbacks liquor store and lounge, said that be-cause the lounge is not a venue, he doubts people will come speciﬁ  cally for the cheap beer. However, he said the bar was packed Thursday night and PBR was selling well at the dis-counted price.
“They’re selling fast, but I 
can’t say they’re selling faster,” he said.
This year has also seen a 
record high in volunteer num-bers. Fest 12 needed 527 volun-teers — up from 400 last year, Weinbender said.
“Fest is longer this year,” he 
said. “It takes more people to run it.”
Weinbender said Fest passes 
can be bought at merchandise stands. This is the ﬁ  rst year at-tendees can pay at stands with credit cards, he said.
As far as the effect of Ybor 
City’s pre-Fest on the upcom-ing weekend in Gainesville, he said it simply served to pump up the crowd.

Students can call 904-630-SAFE
Uber, a smartphone app that links riders to 
on-demand private rides, will also be available 
in Jacksonville for the ﬁ  rst time.
“This smartphone application promotes a 
safer, faster way for people to get to where they need to be,” said spokeswoman Nairi Hourda-jian. “We’re hoping that this weekend will be a great start to something different.”
During the weekend, students can call 904-630-SAFE for general safety information and resources. More information such as rates and locations for parking can be found on the ofﬁ  cial website for the game at ﬂ  ga.org.
Alison Pondo, 22-year-old UF public relations 
senior, said she has had positive experiences vis-iting Jacksonville the past couple of years.   
“There is a little bit of a crazy atmosphere, 
but I expect the trafﬁ  c and the crazy amount of people there,” Pondo said. “It deﬁ  nitely makes you recognize the environment around you and the precautions we have to take."FL/GA , from page 1“They're selling fast, 
but I can't say they're

hangover — or that other kind of hangover — isn’t painful

As you already know, that short time period between

Although it was yesterday, we’re giving you a special 
Halloween edition of our Friday editorial. Pour some cof-fee to go along with your leftover Twix and Butterﬁ  ngers and enjoy this week’s 
Tricks & Treats
Our ﬁ  rst TRICK goes to the Jonas Brothers, who 
prompted both broken hearts and some head-scratching across the nation this week when they announced their split this week. Isn’t that going to make family dinners a bit uncomfortable?
USA Today reported a “deep rift” had formed between 
the boys. Could it be due to Kevin’s marriage? Joe’s alleged drug addiction? Nick’s abs that just won’t quit? We won’t know until the E! True Hollywood Story that’ll come out in another 15 years — long after they’ve become irrelevant — because Lord knows they won’t merit a VH1 Rock Doc. But we know they’re just being coy, and if you haven’t already, start placing bets on how soon they’ll be getting back to-gether to compile a holiday album.
In other celebrity news, we’re handing off an unlikely 
TREAT to Miley Cyrus, whose Lil’ Kim 1999 VMAs cos-
tume didn’t involve any blackface makeup, unlike Julianne Hough’s controversial “Orange is the New Black”-inspired costume.
Although Cyrus doesn’t quite have Lil’ Kim curves, the 
tongue-wagging pop star received a thumbs up from the famous rapper herself over Twitter.
“...I wish I was there to squeeze your boob :) :)” Lil’ Kim 
tweeted. “Love U so much !!!! #mytwin.”
OK, we’re moving on from Halloween news now. ABC News-Fusion released a report that revealed only 
23 percent of Republicans surveyed agreed that “it would be a good thing if more women were elected to Congress,” while others remain indifferent. Democrats clocked in 60 percent — which is still pretty low, to be sure. But come on, Republicans! A TRICK for you. We need more ladies 
in government — and no, Michele Bachmann and Sarah Palin don’t count.
And, ﬁ  nally, it’d be criminal not to hand off a TREAT to 
the Boston Red Sox for their ﬁ  rst-time-in-95-years World 
Series win at Fenway Park. And if you’re a Red Sox hater, cool your jets: They deserve this moment.
Once again, we’re wishing you a fun and, hopefully, 
relatively stress-free November.
Have a good weekend!
Saudi women rebel — from the driver’s seat
There is a wonderful movie called “Wadjda” that 
traces the plight of a young girl determined to get her hands on a bicycle. 
Growing up in a patriarchal Saudi Arabia, Wadjda is 
confronted by oppressive gender roles and laws that pre-
vent her from purchasing and riding a bike with her male friends. 
Members of the community and her family censure 
Wadjda for her ambitions. 
In Saudi Arabia, Wadjda’s struggle is reality for ev-
ery woman. 
Though there is no law prohibiting women from 
driving, women aren’t allowed to apply for driver’s li-
censes in Saudi Arabia. 
Given the country’s nature of absolute monarchy, 
protests by men or women are often highly improbable, so the laws seem irreversible. Unbeknownst to many, however, a progressive revolution is unfolding in the birthplace of Islam. 
Al-Jazeera reported that more than 60 women have 
admirably assumed the most rebellious political posi-tion a woman can assume in Saudi Arabia: the driver’s seat. 
The women then posted numerous videos of their 
vehicular deﬁ  ance on YouTube. Though this may seem like a small step, these courageous women may be ignit-ing a progressive revolution in Saudi Arabia. 
Judy Bachrach, in an article for World Affairs Jour-
nal, argues the effects will be massive. She believes if women are granted the right to drive, they may commit adultery, attempt to get a divorce or even — gasp — ﬁ  nd a job. 
Reading this, you may be bafﬂ  ed. However, for an 
enslaved people, a willingness to disobey everyday norms counts as progress. I employ the word “enslaved” because that’s what half of the population is in Saudi Arabia: property. Without a male guardian, women are also forbidden from working, opening a bank account or trav-eling. 
The gender-based restric-
tions are clearly intended to keep power in the hands of the hereditary male leadership. 
Yet the Saudi Royal family 
is not invincible, and a num-
ber of countries and organizations have scrutinized the regime. For instance, the U.N. Human Rights Council, Canada, the U.K. and the Czech Republic all expressed concern about the human rights situation. 
Ironically, Saudi Arabia is expected to win a seat on 
the Human Rights Council next month. 
One can only hope that before this happens, the 
women of Saudi Arabia — and the gay men and women who face beheading as punishment — gain internation-al attention for their courage. If not, then the burden rests on us. 
The United States is a staunch ally of the oil king-
dom and therefore faces a moral obligation to foster the growth and well-being of that country in any way it can. 
Doing so will set a precedent and warn other ul-
traconservative hereditary regimes — a North Korean family comes to mind — that there are consequences for their actions. 
Furthermore, support from the Unites States and her 
allies will give the women of Saudi Arabia a sense of support that their “guardians” have so willingly relin-quished. 
Perhaps with such support, women can one day tran-
scend Wadjda’s dreams of the driver’s seat and assume a long-deprived Senate seat.

A couple of years ago, I was asked how I 
could be 20 years old and still be a vir-gin. The girl asking me this had found 
me through a mutual friend and had been asking me questions of this sort for a couple of days. She was a beautiful girl, and to say that I was not interested in her would be a colossal lie. But at the same time, I was hesitant to actu-ally agree to sleep with her because I hadn’t actually met her in person yet.
And I felt ashamed of this hesitation. Not 
just ashamed, I felt humiliated, emasculated and worthless. I admit, it was completely ir-rational; there’s no reason for me to have felt this way. Whether I have had sex or will have sex with someone is my business, and I had no obligation to sleep with this girl.
But it still felt horrible making the decision 
to say “no.”
That’s the sort of thing they don’t really 
prepare you for when they teach you about consent and, for that matter, sexual assault. It’s one thing to understand the statistics — how you are much more likely to be assaulted by someone you know rather than a stranger. It’s one thing to say “no” in a safe, almost clinical, environment of a seminar, but quite another to say “no” in the moment.
Part of that problem is that a 
lot of the conversation appears to be centered on how a woman is supposed to say “no.” I feel like that’s due to the particular societal expectations that are placed on men; expecta-tions we generally don’t think about.
The saying goes something like, “If a man 
sleeps with 10 women, he’s a conqueror. If a woman sleeps with 10 men, she’s a slut.” Ig-noring for the moment how misogynistic that statement is with regards to women, it doesn’t exactly do that much for men either.
Men are expected to be having sex or else 
want to have sex. If a man says he’s been raped, the ﬁ  rst reaction is usually ridicule or the inevitable question of “What are you com-plaining about?”
The idea of a man being raped, particularly 
by a woman, sounds ridiculous. The statistics about sexual assault make it sound that much more ridiculous. Survivors of sexual assault and rape are overwhelmingly women, and the perpetrators are overwhelmingly men.
However, given that rape and sexual as-
sault are the two most underreported crimes, we don’t know the true scope of how those crimes affect both gen-ders. We can chalk that up to the fact that we happen to live in a society that shames the survivors of those crimes. It’s a blame game 
that actually does translate across the gender gap, with women getting the insulting “You were asking for it” garbage and men getting the equally demeaning “What’s the problem?” reaction.
The reason for that reaction to men is, I 
think, because of the presupposition that men have to be the dominant player with regards to sex. Men who do not want to have sex are seen as effeminate, emasculated, submissive or somehow defective. It’s (usually) not some-thing that is explicitly said, but it’s something that is constantly subconsciously pounded into our heads.
And that’s what’s going through your 
mind when you’re making the decision to turn down a sexual advance. The feeling that you should just be going for it because, why not? If a woman’s already hell-bent on sleeping with you, what’s the problem? You’ve already cleared the “consent” objection, at least from her end, so why not go for it?
And if you say “no?” What does that say 
about you? Does it make you, somehow, a lesser man? Does it make you a prude in people’s eyes? Is there something wrong with you? What, exactly, do you say to your friends when they ask you “So did you tap that?” and you answer “no.”
This is all rhetorical supposition, obvi-
ously. The answers to those questions are: Nothing, not at all, no, no and who cares what they think. But those are the sorts of things that go through your head when you’re going through that situation.
And that’s not something that a seminar 
can prepare you for. That’s not something that a lesson to men on what “consent” means can teach you. Unfortunately, it’s one of those things that you have to experience ﬁ  rsthand to understand.
So when you do experience it, and you 
start doubting yourself for turning down sex, don’t.
There is nothing wrong with just saying 
“no.”

STAFF REPORT
A spinoff of last year’s Swamp 
Symphony, Gators Jazz & Blues Fest 
will be hosted from 1 to 4 p.m. Sun-day on Flavet Field.
This music event features per-
formances from UF students, fac-ulty and local musicians. Funk Yard, Buttertones and the UF jazz band, among others, are set to swing.   
The theme changed to Gators 
Jazz & Blues Fest this year because “the jazz scene in Gainesville has re-ally been coming along,” said Nata-lie Morrison, a coordinator of alumni affairs for the College of Fine Arts.
Ben Kahn, director of the event, 
said the festival is a celebration of all UF has accomplished.

…
The Hippodrome Cinema’s four 
nights of horror will add some chill-ing cheer to the spookiest holiday.
Until Saturday, the Hippodrome 
Cinema is presenting “the most ter-rifying cinematic event of the sea-son” with nine horror ﬂ  icks. Cinema director Alisha Kinman said she thinks this is the ﬁ  rst time the Hip-podrome is putting on a Halloween event like this.
Each night is a double feature 
screening with a theme. Admission is $5 a night and includes both mov-ies. Saturday’s “Bloodsuckers!” will close the Halloween movie fest with “The Last Man on Earth” at 8 p.m. and “Lost Boys” at 10 p.m.
If this event goes well, Kinman, 
23,  hopes to have a mini ﬁ  lm festival for every holiday.
“Growing up, movies were an 
event that all families went to and then had a conversation about af-ter,” Kinman said. “I want to give families a chance to have that expe-rience.”

…
The International Tour of His-
torical Buddha Relics is presenting a public exhibit of ancient artifacts.
The event will be held at the A 
Nan Buddhist Temple, at 2120 SE 15th St., and will begin with a cer-emony at 6 p.m. The exhibit will re-main on Saturday from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
At the exhibit, people have the 
ability to be personally blessed by the sacred relics, which would be placed against the person’s head while monks give a blessing. People are also encouraged to bring their pets to be blessed.
In 2001, Buddhist master Lama 
Zopa Rinpoche began touring with the relics from Tibet. Michael Fouts, the marketing representative for the tour, said the Dalai Lama felt this tour was a must-see in the United States.
“Relics don’t normally tour,” he 
said. “We have a hard time seeing them because usually they are en-shrined in stupas in the East.”

Dorian Finney-Smith poses for a photo during Florida’s basketball media day. The redshirt sophomore was one of two players suspended Thursday.
JONATHAN CZUPRYN
Alligator Writer @jczupryn
Coach Billy Donovan has suspended Dorian Finney-
Smith and Damontre Harris indefinitely for violating team 
rules.
Like Scottie Wilbekin, who was suspended on June 10 for 
also breaking team rules, neither Finney-Smith nor Harris will play in tonight’s exhibition game against Florida South-ern at 7 in the O’Connell Center.
All three suspended play-
ers will also be unavailable for the season opener against North Florida on Nov. 8. When asked if 
they will miss more than the first game of the year, Dono-van said a lot depends on how they handle themselves in the near future.
“I’ve got them in practice right now,” Donovan said. 
“They’re practicing. They will do that. There’s some things that they need to do as well. Hopefully, they will do it, and we’ll see how that translates going forward.”
Harris redshirted last season after transferring from South 
Carolina, where he averaged 5.3 points and 4.6 rebounds per game in two seasons.
During Florida’s media day on Oct. 9, Donovan said he 
wanted to try playing the 6-foot-10 Harris at center while Patric Young, who played center for the Gators last year, shifted to power forward.
Although Harris is cleared to practice during the suspen-
sion, he has missed the past two practices with the flu.
Finney-Smith, another transfer who redshirted last sea-

In addition to being without their two newest big men 
due to suspensions, the Gators will not have Michael Frazier II on the court tonight. UF announced Wednesday that Fra-zier had been diagnosed with mononucleosis and will be out indefinitely.

Despite surpassing Southeastern Confer-
ence greats such as Peyton Manning and Tim 
Tebow in the record books, Georgia quarter-back Aaron Murray continues to deal with criticism. 
Quarterbacking an elite program invites 
detractors. 
Murray has made a college career of near 
misses. He led Georgia to the brink of an SEC Championship Game victory last season be-fore falling painfully short, and critics still point to his disappointing 6-13 record against top-25 teams.
But Florida, which Murray and Georgia 
will face at 3:30 p.m. on Saturday in Jackson-ville, focuses less on the criticism and more on his accurate arm and athleticism that can give opposing defenses nightmares.
“Georgia starts with Aaron Murray on 
offense,” coach Will Muschamp said. “He’s having an outstanding year and an outstand-ing career.”
A win Saturday in Ev-
erBank Field would make 
Murray the first UGA quar-terback to beat UF three consecutive times since Buck Belue accomplished the feat from 1979 to 1981. 
Murray’s resume against 
Florida is a mixed bag of victories and interceptions. 
Despite winning two of his three starts 
against the Gators, he has completed only 47 percent of his passes and has seven intercep-tions compared with just six touchdowns.Murray said Saturday is about having fun 
again. There is nothing enjoyable about hav-ing three losses at Georgia, especially an em-barrassing 31-27 road defeat to Vanderbilt. 
Add in season-ending injuries to his top 
three receivers, and Murray’s final college season spiraled into something he never would have expected after Georgia began the year ranked in the top 10.
But the former Tampa Plant High star has 
not let adversity affect him. 
UGA coach Mark Richt observed him 
working with redshirt freshman quarterback Faton Bauta on Friday before leaving for Nashville, Tenn.
“He said that there are no days off. That’s 
how he is. He’s wired that way,” Richt said.

Gators earn share of SEC title

With the Southeastern Con-
ference Championships taking 
place on the Mark Bostick Golf Course today, the Gators are working to make sure the tro-phies stay in Gainesville.
The women aim to win their 
fourth SEC Championship in five years, while the men strive to earn their first SEC victory since 1987.
“At SECs, we have some of 
the top athletes in the nation, so it’s obviously going to be a very fast race,” senior Mark Parrish said. 
“It’s going to take a lot of 
endurance, but then at the same time, it’s probably going to be somewhat tactical when it comes down to the last few kilometers, so you really have to respond to some of the moves.”
The Gators already com-
peted on their home course once this season at the Moun-tain Dew Invitational on Sept. 14 under the same conditions they will be racing today — an 8K for the men and a 6K for the women. 
This gave UF’s freshmen 
a glimpse of SEC competition and a preview to the intensity of the track.
“The first time, I was [very] 
sore after the meet. It was my first 8K,” freshman Carlos Miranda said. “So, I think with this being my third 8K, I’ll be more adjusted to it and be able to perform well out there.”
The men 
finished first at the Moun-tain Dew 
Invitational, t o p p i n g three other SEC teams — second-place Au-
burn, third-place Tennessee and eighth-place LSU — that competed at the meet. Par-rish and junior Jimmy Clark claimed the first two spots, and Florida had its five leading runners place in the top 20.
The women, who were 
without seniors Shelby Hayes and Stephanie Strasser and redshirt junior Cory McGee, placed third of five SEC teams at the home meet, losing to Tennessee and Auburn while topping South Carolina and LSU. 
Redshirt senior Agata 
Strausa was the first SEC run-ner to finish the race, cross-ing the finish line second out of 270 runners with a time of 20:51.06.
Hayes and McGee have 
since returned to the lineup, but Strasser will sit out her fourth consecutive race while she tends to a hamstring in-jury.
After having two weeks to 
prepare, coach Paul Spangler feels the teams are ready, but he acknowledged that there would be stiff competition. 
“If we all run well, if our top 
five guys and top five girls do a good job, we’ll put ourselves in a position to be first or sec-ond,” Spangler said.
The Gators feel confident 
about their ability and feel that having the SEC Champion-ships on their home course for the first time since 2002 gives them an added boost.
“It feels really good to be at 
the golf course,” junior Eddie Garcia said. “We practice on it a few times during the week. We know the course pretty well.”
Added Strausa: “I think it’s 
more of a motivator. We’re not intimidated by anything any team has done so far in the SEC.”

� FLORIDA TIED WITH TEXAS A&M.
MICHELLE PROVENZANO

What coach Becky Burleigh wit-
nessed Thursday was exactly what she 
had been looking for all season.
Florida secured a 5-1 victory over 
Georgia in Athens, Ga., on Thursday night and won a share of the South-eastern Conference regular season title with Texas A&M.
The title is the 13th in the program’s 
18-year history.
“We had a little adversity in the 
beginning of this game, but the team managed to battle through that,” Bur-leigh said. “It was good for us to show some relentlessness in this game.”
Sophomore center back Christen 
Westphal tested her skills offensively, scoring the most unusual goal of the night in the 15th minute.
Westphal took a free kick for Florida 
(15-3-1, 9-2 SEC) and caught Georgia goalkeeper Caitlin Woody out of the goal. The center back shot the ball over Woody’s head and into the back of the net from 45 yards out.
The goal was the first of Westphal’s 
career.
“She got that ball in the right place,” 
Burleigh said. “That’s always a difficult ball — we call it the corridor of the de-cision when you put the ball there. The keeper has to decided whether to come or not, and it’s not always easy.”
Florida went 
on to rifle in three more goals in the first half, with two coming from 
freshman forward and SEC Offensive Player of the Week Savannah Jordan.
Jordan now has 20 goals this sea-
son — the most in a season by a Florida player since Abby Wambach scored 31 goals in 2001.
Junior midfielder Havana Solaun 
clinched her seventh goal of the season, taking a touch on the ball in Georgia’s attacking third and sinking it into an open net.
Georgia’s (12-6-1, 5-5-1 SEC) attack 
came out more dangerous in the sec-ond half with senior midfielder Mad-eline Barker scoring the Bulldogs’ only goal into the upper ninety around the 50th minute.
The Gators could not resist going 
for the retaliation as junior midfielder Annie Speese scored the fifth Florida goal of the night off a penalty kick in the 65th minute. 
“I think a lot of people counted us 
out about a month ago,” Burleigh said, “The team preserved. It was an excit-ing finish.”Gators earn share of title
UF Soccer“Every single day, he wants to try to 
ﬁ  nd a way to get better. He’s not feel-ing sorry for himself, or anything like that. I think he’s still very happy that he’s here with us, and he wants to ﬁ  n-ish strong.” 
Murray will likely be selected on 
the ﬁ  rst day of the 2014 NFL Draft, but for now, he has a chance to put a dis-appointing season behind Georgia — at least for one Saturday. 
He needs two touchdowns to tie 
Danny Wuerffel’s SEC record 114 ca-reer passing touchdowns. 
Murray became the leader in total 
offense and passing yards earlier this year. 
“He’s a very talented passer — 
that’s clear to anyone,” defensive co-ordinator D.J. Durkin said. 
“He knows the offense probably as 
well as the coaching staff does, and it shows when you watch it on tape.”ﬁ  eld, he’s throwing strikes at Mike Martin Field as the future closer on the ‘Noles baseball team. Playing football is just pitch-and-catch for him, and he is going to strike out the Hurricanes on Saturday.

The Hurricanes (+22) will 
round the bases when they play the Seminoles because...
I’ll take Miami to cover. Students 
scoring in Tallahassee is nothing new, but the Hurricanes have a statement to make. Look for Duke Johnson to outshine Jameis Win-ston. Maybe the redshirt freshman phenom should stick to the baseball diamond.

Now onto the picks!In ﬁ  rst place with a 43-26-3 re-
cord is alligatorSports Staff Writer Joe “Schmuck Dynasty” Morgan, who incorrectly named the wrong star of the popular TV show, “Duck Dynasty” in last week’s picks col-umn. Sorry about that, folks. 
Coming in second at 42-27-3 is 
alligatorSports Editor Phil “Where the ladies at?” Heilman, who com-plimented a photo of Joe with two lovely women — who turned out to be Joe’s sisters. Slow your roll, Phil. 
Next up with a record of 41-28-
3 is alligatorSports Assistant Editor Adam “Sour grapes” Lichtenstein, who ranted all Wednesday night after the Red Sox won the World Series. Shut up, Adam. Maybe the Yankees can win the retirement-home title next year.
Rounding out the alligatorSports 
staff at 39-30-3 is Staff Writer Adam “The Buck Stops Here” Pincus, who wrote a miniature history lesson as part of a story this week. We didn’t know you had such an afﬁ  nity for Harry S. Truman. 
In ﬁ  rst place in the non-alligator-
Sports division and tied for fourth overall with a record of 38-31-3 is FightinGators.com’s Cody “Live Life At The Mac” Jones, whose Twitter followers are staging a mu-tiny because he continues to tweet about Gators baseball nearly four months before the season begins. 
Making a charge all the way to 
a tie for fourth is the Orlando Sen-tinel’s Edgar “Project Runway” Thompson, who wore a sweater to media availability that was so hideous, he sent players, coaches and other members of the press running. Someone give this man a wardrobe makeover, please. 
Up next with a record of 36-33-3 is 247sports.com’s Thomas “Twit-ter Is Serious Business” Goldkamp, who has been policing the Twitter-verse for content. Jeez, man. Not ev-erything that goes up online needs to be critiqued like the Gators’ of-fense. And in dead-ass last place with 
a piss-poor record of 34-35-3 is In-sideTheGators.com’s Bryan “Hand Sanitizer” Holt, who is scrubbing down his apartment as we speak in order to protect himself from being infected with MRSA. Face it, bud. You’ve probably had worse. FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 1, 2013  ALLIGATOR, 15

MURRAY , from page 13Durkin impressed by MurrayYeguete questionable for game
has been cleared to practice but is still unsure 
whether he will play tonight.
Donovan said he is leaving the decision to 
play up to Yeguete.
“I would say that, right now, Will is feeling 
and talking that he does not want to play for [Friday],” Donovan said Thursday. “If he does play [Friday], it’s going to be on his terms. I’m not forcing him or telling him he can’t.”
Because of the three suspensions and the 
rash of injuries that have plagued No. 10 Flor-ida, Donovan said he has not thought about a starting ﬁ  ve for tonight’s exhibition match. He said the starting lineup 
will have no bearing on the rest of the season because the Gators do not currently have their full complement of players.
“Right now, we’re not 
a very good team, and I’m not so sure it’s necessarily all because of [the players],” 
Donovan said. “We’ve had some injuries. 
“We’re not the same team. I think if every-
body looked at it on paper before the season started, each guy is healthy, each guy is here, what our team would look like, and our team is not that team on paper.”BASKETBALL , from page 13

As the Gainesville weather 
cools and the season begins to 
change, the Gators are in the midst of their own change — at running back.
When Kelvin Taylor starts for 
Florida against Georgia in Jack-sonville on Saturday, he will be UF’s third starting tailback this season. 
Coach Will Muschamp and his 
staff hope he will be the last.
“He’s continued to improve 
throughout the season, week to week,” Muschamp said. 
“He’s always been a very in-
stinctive, natural runner. It’s very obvious … I think he’s done a nice job and deserves the oppor-tunity.”
It has taken only two months 
for the freshman from Glades Day School to get that opportunity.
Taylor was not supposed to 
start this season. 
Sophomore Matt Jones, who 
performed admirably in a backup role last season, was the projected starter.
However, Jones suffered a vi-
ral infection before fall practice began, missing camp and UF’s season opener. 
Redshirt junior Mack Brown 
got the start in Jones’ place. Tay-lor was relegated to ﬁ  ve carries in late in Florida’s win against Toledo.
Muschamp said after the sea-
son opener that he was excited to see Taylor’s progression, but the freshman needed to work on other aspects of his game in order to see more time on the ﬁ  eld.
Extenuating circumstances forced Muschamp’s hand.
Jones returned in Florida’s (4-
3, 3-2 Southeastern Conference) second game of the season but struggled during his time on the ﬁ  eld. 
Outside of a breakout 176-yard 
performance on the road against Kentucky, he averaged 3.2 yards per carry. 
The sophomore got off to a 
promising start against LSU on Oct. 12 before suffering a torn me-niscus, which ended his season.
Brown has also had trouble 
moving the ball, averaging 3.6 yards per carry on 99 rushing at-tempts this season.
“We have a hard time running 
it and certainly can’t protect very well,” Muschamp said after Flori-da’s loss to Missouri on Oct. 19.
But Taylor is expected to boost 
the Gators’ offense.
He scored Florida’s lone offen-
sive touchdown against Missouri and has averaged more than 6 yards per rush on 28 carries.
However, his solid offensive 
performance did not come with-out controversy. After scoring, Taylor received only one more carry the rest of the game.
“Looking back on it, when 
Kelvin came on, he kind of got in a ﬂ  ow,” offensive coordinator Brent Pease said. “Sometimes he wasn’t in there, and he probably should have because he got us go-ing again.”
With his solid performance 
against Missouri and Pease look-ing to simplify the offense before the Gators’ matchup with the Bulldogs (4-3, 3-2 SEC), Taylor will likely bear the brunt of the offensive load on Saturday in Jacksonville. 
The freshman has shown the 
ability to make quick cuts and break off explosive plays — something Florida has lacked all season.
Five of Taylor’s 12 runs went 
for 5 yards or more against Miz-zou. 
The rest of the team combined 
for three rushes that long against the stout Tigers defense.
“He’s gotten past the ﬁ  rst 
level,” Pease said. “He’s become physical. He’s had great ball se-curity. I think even starting to see and get better at the big picture within the passing game of every-thing also.”
Taylor’s ﬁ  rst start could not 
come at a more critical time. The Gators are on the brink of elimi-nation in the SEC Eastern Divi-sion. 
Florida already needs assis-
tance to reach the conference title game. Another loss would end its season.
But the pressure is not getting 
to the freshman. 
Said Pease: “He wants to go.”
