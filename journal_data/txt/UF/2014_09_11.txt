REMEMBERING 9/11
ERIN FORD

UF students will unite tonight 
at a candlelight vigil to honor the 
lives impacted by Sept. 11.    
Nine campus cultural organiza-
tions will be hosting the vigil and panel. 
The panel will include repre-
sentatives from the South Asian-American, Muslim-American, Sikh-American and Arab-Ameri-can communities. 
Doors will open at 6 p.m. in Tur-
lington L007 for the panel, which will be followed by a candlelight vigil on Turlington Plaza at 8:15 p.m. 
Various student-led groups 
within the university are taking part in the night of remembrance. Maulin Patel, president of Delta 
Epsilon Psi, which is co-spon-soring the event, said when he heard about the panel, he knew he couldn’t pass it up. 
“As a South Asian-interest fra-
ternity on campus, this topic really hits home for us,” Patel, a 19-year-old UF biological engineering ju-nior, said. 
As the ﬁ  rst of its kind, the event 
will help educate and bring to light the various experiences of the Middle-Eastern and South Asian-American communities after Sept. 11,  Sameer Saboungi, a 20-year-old UF international studies junior and 
president of UF’s Arab Students’ 
Association, wrote in an email. 
“In order to bring unity, aware-
ness, tolerance and appreciation of each other, we must understand 
each others’ stories,” he said.

� IT MOVED UP ONE SPOT TO 48.

The 2015 U.S. News & World Report ranking of the na-
tion’s top universities is here. While Florida State Univer-
sity’s numbers dropped, UF moved up one spot to 48 for its national university ranking.  
In the public university rankings, UF held its place for 
the second year at No. 14 even as the university’s adminis-trators continue the push for a top 10 ranking. 
The U.S. News rankings are based on “reliable indica-
tors of academic quality” and a “researched view of what matters in education.”  
“We held our ground and remain in good company 
with some of the nation’s best public universities,” UF President Bernie Machen said in a statement. “UF’s Pre-eminence Plan is a long-range plan. We have already 
hired 52 of the best faculty from around the world just this 
year, and we’re optimistic that the plan will bear fruit as it continues to gain momentum.” 
Jane Smith, a UF mathematics lecturer, said even if UF 
makes it to the top 10, the prestige of the university in the eyes of prospective students will remain strong. 
“This is the best university in Florida,” she said. “Over-
all rankings (are) not affecting… the population that we get.”UF rises in top US 
college rankings

Capt. John Redmond of the Alachua Coun-
ty Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce remembers the fear.
Redmond worked early morning shifts as 
a deputy sheriff in 1990, when Danny Rolling 
ravaged Gainesville. He guarded the grue-
some crime scenes of ﬁ  ve different students, 
murdered and mutilated by Rolling’s hands.  When Redmond walked 
into homes, he’d see pistols and baseball bats around. 
“You’d go to answer a 
call and knock on someone’s door,” Redmond said, “and 
the guy behind the door 
would have a shotgun.”
After the ﬁ  rst few days 
of Rolling’s attacks, classes were canceled. Campus was a ghost town, he said.
“Even after they resumed,” Redmond said, 
“no one came back.”
Rolling later admitted to killing eight peo-
ple and was put to death by lethal injection in 2006. But 24 years after the attacks, police are 
searching for a new predator. 
Since Aug. 30, four assaults have occurred 
both on and near campus. Each victim gave 
a similar suspect description: a white man at least 6 feet tall with a large build and dark hair.
Though the recent attacks are not similar to 
those in the past, the fear is familiar. 
Pepper spray and rape whistles are sold 
out throughout town. Self-defense classes are 
ﬁ  lling up.

volunteers guiding students home each night Climate of fear in Gainesville reminiscent of 1990 Rolling murders

Girls dressed in teal in hon-
or of Sexual Assault Aware-
ness Week lined the seats of the University Auditorium on Wednesday to hear a survivor 
tell her story. 
Angela Rose was a high 
school senior when she was 
grabbed in 1996 outside the mall where she worked.
The audience listened as 
Rose described the night she was taken by a repeat sex of-fender on parole for murder.
Rose founded Promoting 
Awareness, Victim Empower-ment (PAVE), an organization that teaches people to break their silence on their past expe-riences with sexual violence.
“Repeat offenders are not 
all that uncommon on college campuses,” she said. “Research shows that. It’s also important to know that healing is absolutely possible and it is a choice.”
The attacks plaguing cam-
pus have caused fear to ripple through the student body. Fe-male students like Kate Ander-sen, a 20-year-old UF tourism and hospitality management junior, are not willing to put their safety at risk.
“This event only brings 
more focus to learning ways to protect yourself and to be aware of your surroundings,” she said. 
At the event, Susan Webster, 
the SG Senate majority leader, said stories like Rose’s can hap-pen to anyone.  
“It’s unfortunate that the at-
tacks on campus have come at the same time as our event, but this gives students even more reason to be educated,” she said.Rape survivor shares

Paranoia ensued Tuesday night as Gainesville Po-
lice responded to a call near Sorority Row, but the in-
cident was not related to the recent string of assaults on and near campus.
Two black males were observed acting suspicious 
near a motor scooter at 1000 SW Sixth Ave. After fur-ther observation, GPD Ofﬁ  cer Dylan Hayes-Morrison believed the two men were trying to steal the scooter. 
Ofﬁ  cer Hayes-Morrison, who was working under-
cover, approached the individuals and identiﬁ  ed him-self as a law enforcement ofﬁ  cer before the suspects ﬂ  ed south on foot. 
The two individuals were apprehended by Hayes-Morrison and a fellow ofﬁ  cer at 825 SW 11th St. and identiﬁ  ed as juveniles, ages 14 and 15.
UF communications director Donna Winchester 
said the rumor control hotline received calls regard-
ing the scooter incident Tuesday. 
Following the string of assaults, students are en-
couraged to utilize ofﬁ  cial news sources for conﬁ  rma-
tion. She suggests using the UF website, the UPD and GPD’s websites and social media accounts.
“Things happen. There are always incidents, but it 
doesn’t necessarily mean it’s related to the assaults,” Winchester said. 
Winchester said the rumor hotline has seen a de-
crease in its number of callers since the fourth attack 
Sunday, with Monday receiving the highest volume.Failed scooter theft sparks rumors

Students no longer need to safely 
remove their USBs. 
UF students, faculty and staff 
were recently granted 1,000 GB of 
free cloud storage for their ﬁ  les. 
The new service is called One-
Drive @ UF, a product of Microsoft that is part of a series of existing ser-vices called GatorCloud, said Tracy Gale, communications manager for UF Information Technology.
With OneDrive, saved docu-
ments and ﬁ  les are not limited to the 
UF community, Gale said. Students 
can share photos and videos with friends and family anywhere. 
“It frees up a lot of space for you 
and gives you a lot of storage capac-ity,” Gale said, “but it also gives you the opportunity for all these other collaboration tools.”
To be eligible for OneDrive, stu-
dents must use Ofﬁ  ce 365 email, she said. UFIT launched the email ser-vice for students in November as an alternative to GatorLink Webmail.
Anupa Kotipoyina, a UF history 
sophomore, said she does not use 
Ofﬁ  ce 365 but would switch for the 
added beneﬁ  ts. 
“I feel like Webmail is really out-
dated,” said Kotipoyina, 19. 
Gale said UFIT is looking for 
more ways to make students’ infor-mation mobile and easily accessible. 
“OneDrive is part of a continuing 
commitment to making more cloud 
services available for our students,” 
Gale said.UF now has free GatorCloud storage “It’s also important 
to know that healing is

Beer and Pizza: A Perfect Pair
Bartender Brieann Milata, 25, serves thirsty patrons at the First Magnitude Brewing Company launch party at 
Satchel’s Pizza on Wednesday.
Locals remember, continue to worry
since Monday, Redmond said the reac-
tions seem positive. 
“Students are being proactive in-
stead of retreating into their homes,” he said. 
Social media is also being used to 
share information about the recent as-saults and images of the possible sus-pect, Redmond said. He thinks it could help catch the man.
“Back then, all we had was print and 
TV,” he said. 
Redmond said he repeatedly tells his 
daughter, a UF student, to walk home with friends or call the Student Night-
time Auxiliary Patrol or UPD if it’s late 
at night. 
“You can’t let it stop you from doing 
what you need to do,” he said. 
SNAP vans have doubled, and UPD 
has pledged to escort students through-out campus.
Ally Colangelo, an 18-year-old UF 
political science freshman, said she used 
to walk home from the library without 
being scared on late summer nights. But now she’s terrified. 
“I find myself being really cautious 
about everyone I see when I’m walking around,” Colangelo said. Colangelo said her mom is worried, 
too. As she was doing laundry Tuesday night in Broward Hall at about 11 p.m., her mom asked Colangelo to text her every 15 minutes or she would notify the police. 
Nicole Giaquinto, a 20-year-old UF 
public relations junior, said it’s hard for her to feel safe on campus. She’s frus-trated she can’t go to the gym or for a 
run without worrying about her well-
being. But there’s a positive to every negative, she said.
“The good thing is that girls are real-
izing that they have to be more aware,” Giaquinto said.Rolling , from page 1� SITES LIKE NETFLIX SLOWED DOWN TO

Students who visited websites like Netflix, Four-
square, Tumblr and Etsy on Wednesday may have no-
ticed their pages were loading slower than normal.
The delay was part of Internet Slowdown Day, meant 
to raise awareness about net neutrality. Net neutrality is 
the idea that Internet Service Providers should treat all 
data equally, including not charging websites more for faster service or slowing down high-traffic sites.
Participating websites asked users to send in com-
ments to the Federal Communication Commission, preventing big businesses from charging users more for Internet services.
“I don’t think the Internet should be regulated unless 
you’re breaking the law,” said Logan Cundiff, a 19-year-
old UF computer engineering freshman. “It violates free-
dom of speech and the First Amendment.”
UF law of mass communication professor Clay 
Calvert said students like Cundiff, who watch shows on Netflix and use more bandwidth, can currently be charged more for Internet services. But the charge might be unconstitutional.
“It would be an abuse,” said Sarah Garcia, a 19-year-
old UF computer engineering sophomore. “One more thing to pay for to use when it should be free.”
Calvert said Netflix and other content providers are 
in favor of net neutrality because they want users to have faster delivery of movies and television shows while the companies that install Internet want to profit from peo-ple using more of their bandwidth. 
Cundiff said he doesn’t want to pay the extra cost.“I support…the freedom of the Internet, and they 
support the people’s preferences instead of other prefer-
ences,” Cundiff said.
Calvert had a different opinion on net neutrality. 
“I don’t mind seeing companies charge more if peo-
ple consume some vast amount of content because it does slow down everybody’s traffic,” he said.
People can send in comments to the FCC until Mon-
day about whether they believe the Internet should be a public utility.Slowdown Day

Eulogies for Michael Brown and 
Palestinian Mohammed Abu Khdeir 
were read outside of Turlington Hall on Wednesday. 
The UF Students for a Democratic So-
ciety and Students for Justice in Palestine joined forces to host a rally for students supporting the people of Palestine and Ferguson, Missouri.  
Members of both organizations car-
ried cut-out tombstones with the names and pictures of deceased youth who had lost their lives under tragic circumstanc-es. 
Tesneem Shraiteh, president of the 
UF Students for Justice in Palestine, said the deaths of Brown and Abu Khdeir should not be forgotten. 
“We wanted to raise awareness to 
the systems of oppressions that cause these losses and to draw connections 
between them,” Tesneem, a 20-year-old 
UF linguistics junior, said. “They’re not isolated unfortunate events that happen to occur.”
During the rally, Jonathan Waring, 
president of UF Students for a Demo-cratic Society, said demilitarization of the police could prevent deaths like Mi-chael Brown’s from happening. 
“The members of the Ferguson Police 
Department who were sent in to dis-perse the protesters were trained by the Israeli Defense Force,” said Waring, a 19-year-old UF psychology sophomore. “So there’s a connection between the na-tional and the international events that are taking place.” Eulogy: rally in solidarity

After biking across America by herself this 
summer, Van Truong learned the significance 
of self defense. 
Throughout her trip, the 19-year-old UF 
Spanish and anthropology sophomore was 
sponsored by Smart Stun, a self-defense retail 
company. In light of recent attacks on and near campus, Truong reached out to the company again to see what they could do.
“I felt safer biking and hitch-hiking for 83 
days by myself than when I’m on campus at night and trying to get on the bus,” she said.
The New Hampshire-based company re-
sponded and is offering UF students three 
Barracuda BC-37 stun guns online for $99.95, 
when they are typically $54.95 each. Students can receive the discount by typing “Protect the University of Florida” in the comment box.
Smart Stun’s owner and president Nate 
Sprague said the deal will be available through Thanksgiving.
“Van expressed concern to me, and I had 
gotten some calls from parents of students at UF,” Sprague said. “I thought it would be a good way to help out and offer a chance for some extra protection.”
Stun guns are only allowed on campus with 
a concealed weapons permit, said UF police spokesman Maj. Brad Barber. Pepper spray is allowed.
“Our focus is to provide information and 
safety considerations that people can use and rely upon to help avoid incidences and loca-tions where they may find themselves to be victims of crime,” Barber said.
Manali Patel, a 20-year-old UF applied 
physiology and kinesiology senior, said she walks with groups of four or five people when it’s dark now.
“My friends and I carry pepper spray, but if 
I knew I’d be on campus at night I think having a stun gun would help me feel a lot safer,” Pa-tel said. “I think it’s cool that they’re doing this deal. I have two other roommates so it would be great for us.”Company discounts stun guns

�POLICE SAY HE FILMED A

Alligator Staff Writer mmihm@alligator.org
A state attorney is being investigated 
after police say he videotaped a woman 
partially nude at a local tanning booth. 
The victim was applying lotion to her 
legs at TanUSA on 6783 W. Newberry 
Road when she noticed a cell phone 
being held over the wall from the next room. The man with the phone was later identiﬁ  ed as William Richard Ezzell of the Eighth Circuit State Attorney’s Of-ﬁ  ce, according to an incident report. 
As the 51-year-old continued, she 
looked up and saw the phone again. This time, she noticed a light was illuminated, 
and thought she was being recorded. 
The victim then yelled for Elizabeth Depatie, an employee at TanUSA. 
“F****** peeping Tom,” she yelled at 
Ezzell.
From inside his tanning booth, Ezzell 
calmly replied, “I don’t know why you 
would say that.”
The victim then put her clothes on, 
walked to the front desk and sat down. After the victim said she would call the police, Ezzell left the area. According to the report, he was wearing a white dress shirt, a tie and slacks.
Depatie pulled up Ezzell’s registra-
tion form and told police she saw a badge in his wallet. Gainesville Police used her information to conﬁ  rm his identity. 
GPD investigators issued a sworn 
complaint against Ezzell. They recom-mended charges of video voyeurism, a third-degree felony. 
Because of a conﬂ  ict of interest, the 
complaint was ﬁ  led directly with Fifth Circuit State Attorney Brad King.Local state attorney under

ing the People United for Medical Marijuana organization, told medical marijuana support-ers about his quadriplegic brother’s experience with marijuana to relieve his pain. 
He said a lot of people get lost in the cam-
paign thinking it’s about legalizing marijuana for recreational use, but it’s not. 
“The people we are ﬁ  ghting have no argu-
ment,” he said.
The medical-marijuana amendment aims 
to help those with certain medical conditions such as HIV, cancer, multiple sclerosis and oth-er conditions function without having to take 
multiple pain medications.  Only physicians 
will be able to prescribe patients they feel can beneﬁ  t from using medical marijuana, accord-ing to the amendment. 
Jeff Lahman, a United for Care member, 
spoke about his personal experience with using medical marijuana at the conference. 
“It was a Godsend,” he said. Lahman suf-
fers from stage three kidney failure, lung can-
cer, arthritis and other illnesses.  
The use of medical marijuana allows him to 
function in his daily life without having to take 
a dozen medications, he said. 
After the conference, Morgan headed over 
to the Computer Science and Engineering building to speak with College Democrats. 
Morgan continued the marijuana conversa-
tion by discussing the use of painkillers. 
If medical marijuana replaced the use of 
painkillers like OxyContin, billions would be lost in revenue for big  pharmaceutical compa-nies, Morgan said.  
“This is not a political issue, this is a medical 
issue,” he said. 
Voting for the amendment begins on Nov.

weapons are capitalizing on the fear from the assaults? 
Men: Shut up and listen about assault
With the recent reports of Ray Rice committing as-
sault and the outbreak of assaults at UF, the topic of violence against women is on everybody’s 
lips.  
In general, people’s opinions on these issues are fairly 
similar. 
The American public, for the most part, wants to see 
Ray Rice punished and wants to see the NFL held account-able for virtually ignoring this crime until recently.
The Gainesville community also wants to see the men 
responsible for assaulting women on campus arrested and convicted. Unfortunately, this sentiment of punishing crim-inal offenders doesn’t go far enough.
While I was riding the bus to campus Monday, a couple 
sitting in front of me was discussing the growing number of UF Alerts notifying students of attempted assaults. The woman said, “Now I am more scared of walking alone at night. In the past, I was okay, but now I’m scared of any male that –”.
The man quickly interrupted by saying, “Don’t worry, 
I’ll walk you to wherever you need to go. Remember, I’m one of the good guys.”
While his offer seems like a courteous gesture, this well-
intentioned individual completely missed the point. He was under the impression that the young woman’s heightened fear of assault was a temporary one, and as a result, he tried to give her a quick fix to her problem.
When the issue of rape comes up, men tend to take it 
personally. We often resort to defending and distinguish-ing ourselves as “one of the good guys.” It is our obligation to actively listen, research and learn about how pervasive sexual assault is, especially on college campuses.
As men, we have to stop making these issues about our-
selves and start to actually listen. Hearing numerous stories of harassment and assault might make us squeamish and uncomfortable. 
Unfortunately, these situations are even worse for the women who have to experience and live through them at an alarm-ing and growing rate.
Victimized women are already 
uncomfortable with sharing traumatic experiences and they have been conditioned by society to keep to themselves. 
We should take a step back and let women have their 
space to vent their frustration and fear.
One way to help is to challenge other men who engage 
in sexual harassment, assault or any kind of violence. This seems like a no-brainer, but it simply does not happen as often as it should.
If you see a man engaging in catcalls, groping, unwanted 
comments on women’s bodies or any other inappropriate behavior, call them out on it. 
Demand accountability for sports entities and other in-
stitutions that value profits over the safety of women. Offer support to people who are willing to go public with their stories of being assaulted or raped.
When a marginalized group talks about its struggles, 
the best thing to do as a privileged person is to listen, offer assistance and examine your own behavior to determine if you are part of the problem.
It is not enough to just protect women with quick fixes. 
We have to tell our brothers, cousins, uncles, friends and anyone else who will listen that any kind of violence against women is wrong.
With the increasing relevance of sexual assault and relat-
ed issues to UF students, all of us, particularly those in lead-ership positions — fraternity presidents, executive board members and community and Student Government lead-ers — have a remarkable opportunity to stand up against this criminal behavior.
Sexual assault is more than just a women’s issue; it is an 
issue that concerns all of us. It’s time for men to “man up.”

appear on Fridays.Florida House bill 
threatens state 
waterways
Tuesday, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill to 
prevent new federal oversight of state wetlands and wa-terways.
According to the Tampa Bay Times, the bill was sponsored 
by Rep. Steve Southerland, R-Fla., and passed the House by a 
262-152 margin. The bill received support from 35 Democrats.
Southerland said on the House floor that increased federal 
oversight of water resources “would have devastating conse-
quences on virtually every major section of our economy, in-cluding farming, construction, manufacturing, transportation and energy development.” Southerland expanded on his sup-port for the bill in a statement, saying the bill will allow the Unit-ed States “to keep our waters cleaner in the future.”
At first glance, Southerland’s proposal seems like a reason-
able one. After all, Florida’s natural resources are especially fragile and unique. Some might argue that state regulators un-derstand Florida’s environmental needs better than the bureau-cracy of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
Unfortunately, if Southerland expects to rely on Florida regu-
lators to oversee the state’s environmental standards, the Sun-shine State’s water resources could be in a world of trouble.
During the administration of Gov. Rick Scott, environmental 
regulation and oversight in Florida has been cut to the bone.
Politifact detailed the ways that Scott has eviscerated the 
state’s environmental protection infrastructure. The measures included cutting dozens of Department of Environmental Pro-tection employees, forcing state water management districts to “slash property tax collections” by millions of dollars, and re-ducing the DEP’s enforcement caseload from more than 2,000 in 2010 to less than 150 through the first five months of 2014.
After an increase during Scott’s first year in office, DEP spend-
ing has declined from $1.8 billion in the 2011-2012 fiscal year to 
just $1.3 billion in 2014. Both those figures pale in comparison to 
environmental spending during the Charlie Crist and Jeb Bush administrations. In 2006, DEP appropriations reached a high of $2.9 billion and have generally declined ever since.
Fortunately for Florida’s environment and those who care 
deeply about it, Southerland’s bill has little chance of even being debated in the Senate, much less being passed.
The fact that the bill was heavily supported by real-estate de-
velopers and strongly opposed by every major environmental 
group demonstrates where Southerland’s true motivations lie.
Southerland would rather curry favor with potential cam-
paign donors than serve the interests of the people and the land 
he was elected to represent.
At a time when global carbon dioxide emissions are at record 
highs and the temperature of the Earth is rising to a dangerous level, protecting the environment in every way possible must remain a high priority.
Florida deserves elected officials who will act as good stew-
ards of the fragile environmental treasures that citizens of the Sunshine State cherish so dearly.THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 11, 2014

“Clybourne Park” hit the Hippo-
drome State Theatre main stage last 
week, but the main feature is the col-laboration between performers from UF and the Gainesville community.
This partnership between the UF 
School of Theatre and Dance and the Hippodrome gives some masters students the opportunity to bring their talents to this multi-award winning play on racial tensions in two different decades.
“Uncomfortable situational com-
edy is the best way to describe it,” 
said Sean Cancellieri, a third-year 
master’s in fine arts candidate who plays two lead male roles.
Cancellieri said he hopes that the 
play can help inspire some change on the racial issues brought up in “Clybourne Park.”
By collaborating with the Hippo-
drome, UF students have the oppor-
tunity to work in a professional set-
ting, which helps prepare students for real-world acting jobs. All the while they are allowed to earn cred-it, said Stephanie Lynge, an actress in the Gainesville community who plays two lead female roles.
Six weeks are allotted to put up a 
show at the academic theater, where-as at the Hippodrome you have two and a half weeks, she said.
Lynge, who has performed on 
Broadway and toured nationally, clearly remembers how she learned the most through experience. Doing things made what she learned in class click.
Art should make you uncomfort-
able and entertain you, she said, and this play is a combination of both.
This is the second production put 
on by the partnership, the first being “Avenue Q” last summer, said Jessi-ca Hurov, managing director of the Hippodrome. Because of the great success the first time, both parties 
wanted to work together again.
“We’ve been thrilled,” she said. 
“It has been a success all around for 
everyone involved.”
The cooperation between UF and 
the Hippodrome benefits both par-ties. UF students get an experience and growth that can’t be provided elsewhere, and the theater can draw 
on talents from the school, Lynge said. Also, it exposes the theater to 
a new audience of students who go and see the show.
Although 18-year-old UF journal-
ism freshman Alexis Cavakis-Perez saw the play because her theater appreciation class required it, she 
recognized “Clybourne Park” as not 
the typical play you would go see.
“It’s a good social commentary 
on the nature of how people behave and how it hasn’t fluctuated over time,” Cavakis-Perez said.
You can see this collaboration in 
action from now until Sept. 28 every day except Mondays. Student tick-
ets are $15.

How often do you wash 
your jeans?
According to the CEO 
of Levi Strauss & Co., Chip 
Bergh, you might be wash-ing them too often. Bergh recently spoke about the 
company’s commitment to 
sustainability, encouraging individuals to prolong wash-ing their jeans. 
“We’re hoping to spread 
the word through the work we’re doing to encourage consumers to wash less and to create more awareness 
about the choices consum-
ers have to make when they purchase new clothes,” the company’s spokeswoman, 
Marisa Giller, wrote in an 
email.
Although the campaign 
has been going on for years, 
“it took an interesting turn 
just a few months ago when our CEO, Chip Bergh, stood up to show the pants he was 
wearing and admitted that 
they hadn’t been washed in a year,” she said.
Washing your jeans every 
two weeks instead of every 
week will not only save 14 
liters of water, but will also serve as a great excuse to re-duce laundry.
Carlotta Murri, a 21-year-
old UF international studies senior, said she thinks pro-longing the washing of den-
im can be beneficial to college 
students living in dorms and paying to use the machines.
“I wash them like, what? 
Every two weeks or so,” she 
said. “I try not to waste wa-
ter.”
Really, it boils down to 
how the jeans are worn. 
“If you’re working in a 
dirty environment, you’ll likely have to wash more of-ten,” Giller said. “If you’re wearing your jeans to class 
every day—probably not as 
much.”
 Richard Lainez, a 20-year-
old UF biology junior, likes 
to wear a pair of jeans at least 
once or twice a week, but said he doesn’t agree with not washing them often.
“During the summer … if 
you’re outside in the day, it’s going to be all sweaty,” Lai-nez said.
An average pair of jeans 
absorbs roughly 3,500 liters of water—and that is after only two years of use. 
Some suggest placing 
them in the freezer to kill 
bacteria and eliminate odor.

A retired Mennonite is not who you would 
expect to plan and participate in demonstra-
tions against corporate giants like Publix. But Gainesville’s Richard MacMaster  has the pho-tos to prove it.
MacMaster, a coordinator for the Interfaith 
Alliance for Immigrant Justice, created a gal-lery of photos to serve as a way to tell not only the story of his organization, but also the sto-ries of the migrant workers that it aims to im-prove working and living conditions for.
The photos line the walls of the Mennonite 
Meeting House at 1236 NW 18th Ave., show-
casing events the organization participated in, as well as portraits of laborers in Immokalee, 
Florida, filling large buckets with tomatoes.
“Our hope is that it would open eyes to 
the very hard and ill-paid work that goes into putting the food on your table,” he said, “espe-cially the winter tomatoes.”
MacMaster said in the winter months, the 
Immokalee area provides tomatoes for nearly the entire country.
“They have to pick an enormous amount 
of tomatoes to make anything near minimum wage,” he said.
A combination of passionate key individu-
als and a desire to address human rights issues happening close to home led the organization 
to form in July 2010. Although students have 
been involved since the beginning, it chose to make religious institutions the cornerstone in order to maintain permanency in a transitional town.
“The appeal to justice 
is very strong in every reli-
gion’s scriptures,” MacMas-
ter said.
Since its creation, the Alliance has worked 
closely with the Coalition of Immokalee Work-ers and the Student Farmworker Alliance to negotiate fair food agreements with food growers and buyers.
The gallery aims to create a visible record 
of all the organization has accomplished and 
inspire continued growth in years to come.
Renee Hoffinger, a retired dietician who is involved with the Alliance, contributed pho-
tos to the gallery.
“As a dietician, I believe all food issues are 
connected,” Hoffinger said. “If you want to nourish yourself, you must do it ethically.”
Hoffinger said her beliefs are rooted in 
her Jewish faith and the tenet of Judaism that prohibits consuming food produced by op-pressed labor.
“We vote with our forks,” she said. “The 
kind of food choices we make determine the world we will live in.”
Those interested in viewing the gallery can 
attend meetings for the Interfaith Alliance for Immigrant Justice at the Mennonite Meeting 
House at 6 p.m. on the second Monday of ev-
ery month.Photo gallery brings light to struggle of migrant workers THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 11, 2014  ALLIGATOR, 9 8, ALLIGATOR  THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 11, 2014

Men and women dressed in thick wool slacks and lay-
ers upon layers of clothing get ready for a long day around 
the farm in Florida’s late-summer heat. If you asked if they were hot, they would raise their eyebrows quizzically — after all, this is 1868.
Dudley Farm Historic State Park’s third Reconstruc-
tion Era reenactment this weekend was called “1868 Comes Alive.” 
Forty-two living historian volunteers devised their 
own scripts and identities to put on the event, a ﬁ  rst-per-son immersion where the characters improvise and react to the audience, like two different eras looking themselves in the face.
The park hosts the event every year to illustrate the 
hardships of Northern Florida citizens during the pivotal Reconstruction Era in history.
Dudley Farm Park Ranger and living historian, David 
Riker, 55, of Bell, Florida, has been participating in reen-actments for 28 years and played the city marshal in this event. As a living historian, Riker and his fellow volun-teers take on speciﬁ  c characters, their emotions, how they lived, thought, ate and slept.
“We’ve lived history, we’ve been in tents, we’ve seen 
sunrises together, we’ve fought battles together,” he said. “We have lived history as close as we can.”
Reconstruction was a very sensitive time in American 
history right after the Civil War; African Americans were free but not citizens.Steve Noll, a UF American history professor, said while 
the event is accurate, it’s very difﬁ  cult to reenact the racial conﬂ  ict during Reconstruction. These are issues that the event at Dudley Farm did not address.
“Issues of race that were never resolved then still play 
out today,” he said.
The men returning from war were sick and without 
homes or jobs. Their families were left without husbands and fathers. Volunteers picked the year 1868 for this spe-ciﬁ  c reason.
■   ■   ■
At 8:30 a.m. Friday, everyone’s dressed and briefed on 
each other’s characters for the day. The school teacher sits on the bench furthest from the door, eating the top of her mufﬁ  n and drinking from a brightly colored metal canis-ter.  Riker tells everyone to do an authenticity check.
“Alright everybody, you know the drill,” he said.The anachronistic bunch look at their wrists and re-
move their watches and wedding rings. Before anything else can be said, a single cell phone goes off, and every-body laughs. The living historians take all precautions to make sure everything is as authentic and realistic as pos-sible.
“You’ll walk in, and it’s like you’re looking at a bunch 
of ghosts,” Riker said.
Tom Sanders, 61, of Ocala, has been doing reenact-
ments for 20 years. He usually goes to Civil War reenact-ments as Maj. Sanders. He works as a cooper, a man who makes wooden buckets and barrels by hand. 
“You know they can’t make me a colonel,” he said.

The JAM turns two today — a mile-
stone the owners didn’t think they’d 
see.
With the expansion of UF’s Innova-
tion Hub downtown, the music venue at 
817 W. University Ave. is only guaran-
teed six months to a year of permanence at a time.
“This building and this whole block 
is scheduled for demolition sometime in the near future,” said co-owner Eduardo “Eddy” Arenas. “From the beginning, we’ve been here with the understand-ing that we could get a 60-day notice to 
vacate.”
Though The JAM may have an uncer-
tain future, it has not stopped providing 
live music.
In its ﬁ  rst year alone, 85 bands played 
the local venue, 215 in its second. The in-crease happened by offering live perfor-mances three to four times a week.
“We try to give all kinds of music 
an opportunity within reason,” he said. “We’re not into offensive music; we try to keep a mindful, conscious message.”
This has created a very respectful community, accord-ing to Arenas, a com-munity that will be present tonight for The JAM’s two-year anniversary party.  
“We tried to call 
upon Gainesville’s 
best musicians,” said Arenas. “If you look at the lineup it’s a lot of bands that have a great following in Gainesville.”
With recent notice that The JAM will 
remain for at least another six months, Arenas and his co-owner, Blake Briand, created an IndieGoGo campaign with a goal of $5,000 where concert-goers and 
the community can donate to help keep 
The JAM aﬂ  oat.
So far they’ve raised almost $1,000, 
with 19 days left. 
“We’re just working people who put 
money and passion into something they love as a hobby; there are no outside in-vestors,” said Briand. “Our goal is the music, not the money.”
The event is free for all to attend. The 
ﬁ  rst set starts at 6 p.m. with a line-up 
that includes Swamp Records-signed 
artist Bells and Robes and local favorite Flat Land.The JAM jams on tonight,

Do you ever ﬁ  nd yourself making snap 
judgments based on race and still insist that 
you’re not racist? The characters in Bruce Norris’ Tony and Pulitzer prize-winning play “Clybourne Park” certainly do.  
The production of “Clybourne Park,” 
which opened Friday at the Hippodrome State Theatre, is a collaboration between the UF School of Theatre and Dance and the Hippodrome. It was scheduled several months before the recent protests in Fergu-son, Missouri, giving the play a surprising sense of urgency and relevance.
The play is a clever companion piece to 
Lorraine Hansberry’s classic drama “A Rai-sin in the Sun” and is set in the same ﬁ  ctional neighborhood ﬁ  rst introduced in “Raisin.”  
Act One begins in 1959 and introduces 
Russ and Bev, a white couple grieving over the loss of their son, who is planning to move out of Clybourne Park. Karl (a char-acter who actually appears in “A Raisin in the Sun”) pleads with Russ and Bev not to 
move, concerned about the black family that 
will now occupy their house. Karl fears more black families will move into the neighbor-hood and decrease the property value of the houses there.Act Two picks up 50 years later, and Cly-
bourne Park has become a predominantly black neighborhood. A white family wants to renovate the house and move in, which will cause a gentriﬁ  cation of the area. Third-year UF masters student Javon Johnson de-livers some hitting one-liners in back-and-
forth racial dialogues in this act.
To avoid spoiling the play’s best surpris-
es, I’ll leave the summary brief.
Norris’ dialogue is engaging and often 
painfully funny. The play moves along at a 
clip without becoming tedious or boring. 
There are several moments of racial ten-
sion that are exceedingly uncomfortable but ultimately aid in driving Norris’ point 
home.  
The skillful company of eight, who play 
different characters in each act, each give 
great performances, but it’s Christopher Swan who manages to stand out. Swan’s performance as Russ is nuanced and believ-able, as he handles the heaviest moments of the piece without overacting.  
This production has much to recom-
mend, Even in a subpar production, the strength of the script would shine the most. Fortunately, the actors carry the script in stride. “Clybourne Park” is a great piece of writing brought vividly to life by a skilled and committed group of performers.Hipp’s ‘Clybourne Park’:

Anna Morgan didn’t mind getting 
wet. 
On the day she got caught in the 
rain without an umbrella, it was the 
books in her hands she was concerned 
for, she said. 
In an attempt to save them, Mor-
gan, a 20-year-old UF English junior, 
crouched down on the sidewalk and created a “body shield” with a friend. 
Just as she thought the books 
would be ruined forever, a man came up to them and offered to share his umbrella.  
“I posted a thank you to him on Fa-
cebook later that day,” said Morgan. “I said, ‘To the nice gentleman with the umbrella: You’ve saved not just me and my friend, but also all of these books that people love.’”
Even though it seemed like you got 
caught in the rain every day, August isn’t really the rainiest month. 
The rainiest month in North Flori-
da is actually June, with an annual av-erage of more than 7 inches, WRUF’s chief meteorologist, Jeff Huffman, wrote in an email.
“The rainy season continues 
through early October, which is why there is more frequent rain during those ﬁ  rst few weeks of class,” he wrote.
Gator fans encountered the rain 
during the canceled football game against Idaho on Aug. 30. 
Allison Kane, a 20-year-old classi-
cal studies junior and member of the 
UF marching band, was face-to-face 
with the storm. 
Kane was not allowed to play her 
clarinet in the rain because woodwind instruments cannot get wet. However, many of her fellow band members played instruments that could with-stand the downpour. 
“I lucked out,” Kane said. “A lot of 
the brass had to stand out in the rain, and their uniforms got soaking wet, and they were cold.”
As the marching band was adapt-
ing to the rain at the game, so were the students in the stands. For Gabriel Martins, it was an unforgettable sea-son opener. 
“This was going to be my ﬁ  rst 
Gator game, and I’m a junior so it’s kinda bad that it was my ﬁ  rst,” said Martins, a 20-year-old UF computer science junior. 
Despite the rain, Martins had fun.“I was enjoying the rain, partying 
in the rain and doing Breakfast Club moves on the bleachers,” said Mar-tins.Rain, rain go the eff awaytheater  historyClassifiedsBUY IT. SELL IT. FIND IT. 373-FIND

The UF soccer team moved up two spots to No. 6 in the NSCAA poll, released on Tuesday. Florida defeated then-No. 2 Florida State 2-1 on Friday.Kan Li / Alligator Staff
Michael Taylor (51) and Caleb Brantley force Eastern Michigan quarterback Reginald Bell to fumble the ball during the Gators’ 65-0 win against the Eagles on Saturday at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium. Despite limiting Eastern Michigan to just 125 total yards of offense, Florida’s defense looks to improve its ability to stop outside runs.
JORDAN MCPHERSON
Alligator Staff Writer @J_McPherson1126
In Florida’s season opener against Eastern Michigan, all 
eyes were focused on the offense.
They looked to see if first-year UF offensive coordinator 
Kurt Roper could increase the tempo the Gators have lacked 
since Will Muschamp took the helm of the program in 2011.
After all the hype surrounding Roper’s spread offense 
since his hiring on Dec. 26, fans thought the offense had 
something to prove.
But the offense isn’t the only group that has a chip on its 
shoulder.
“Everybody has something to prove, not just the offense,” 
linebacker Michael Taylor said. “We’re a team as well. … If we’re playing together and working for a common goal 
which is a win on Saturday morning or Saturday night, then 
it’s everybody playing well together.”
And even after Florida’s 65-0 win against Eastern Michi-
gan, a game in which the Gators’ defense limited the Eagles 
to just 125 yards of total offense, Muschamp still said there 
is room to grow, especially in the secondary.
“I don’t think we were as physical as we needed to be as 
far as playing blocks and tackling,” Muschamp said. “We 
were really soft. But, you know, again, you are coaching 
some guys with some ability and they’re going to continue to

Florida’s secondary has just two upperclassmen with 
starting experience in Jabari Gorman and Brian Poole.
And while the Gators have talented freshmen such as 
Jalen Tabor, Duke Dawson and Quincy Wilson, their lack of experience at the collegiate level was evident at times 
against the Eagles.

J.C. Jackson’s first season at Florida 
is over.
Coach Will Muschamp announced 
on the Southeastern Conference’s week-
ly teleconference that the true freshman 
defensive back will have shoulder sur-gery next week to repair a labrum in-jury that carried over from high school.
Jackson’s shoulder slipped out dur-
ing Florida’s 65-0 win against Eastern Michigan on Saturday. Muschamp said this also occurred during training camp.
“He possibly could continue to push 
through the season but we felt like at his young age to go ahead and get it fixed and move forward,” Muschamp said. “He’s a guy who certainly was going to help on special teams and at corner. He’s going to be an outstanding player. I’m disappointed for him but we have to move forward.”
With Jackson out for the year, Florida is left with four players who practiced exclusively at cornerback throughout training camp — sophomore Vernon Hargreaves III, junior Brian Poole, and true freshmen Jalen Tabor and Quincy 
Williams.
“We were rotating, 
all those freshmen that we brought in played in that game and they’re going to continue to play for us,” UF defensive co-ordinator D.J. Durkin 
said. “They’re in the rotation, they’re going to play in the foreseeable future for games. Obviously that’s one guy less, one guy down, but we have enough bodies back there to be alright.”
Muschamp also restated that left 
tackle D.J. Humphries (bone chip in an-kle) will be out for Florida’s SEC open-er against Kentucky on Saturday and probably will not return until Florida’s game against Tennessee on Oct. 4.Freshman corner out for yearFootbALL

Kentucky running back Jojo Kemp — 
who grew up fewer than two hours from 
Gainesville — said he will have a cheering 
section of more than 50 people in Ben Hill 
Griffin Stadium when the Wildcats visit the Gators on Saturday.
But after his comments on Tuesday, 
Kemp’s enemies will undoubtedly outnum-ber his allies.
“A couple of my (high school) team-
mates actually went to Florida, so I’m fa-miliar with a lot of those guys,” the De-
Land, Fla., native said. “It’s going to be fun 
walking out with a victory and rubbing it in their faces.”
Kemp, who is UK’s fourth-leading 
rusher after two games with 72 yards on 17 rushing attempts, was born a little more than seven years after Kentucky’s last vic-tory against Florida in 1986. 
But the sophomore tailback seemed 
more than confident the Wildcats could steal a win from the Gators in Gainesville for the first time since 1979.“Just shocking, man,” 
Kemps said when asked 
what he thought about 
UF’s 27-game winning streak against UK. 
“I’d love to be part of a  
team that just changes it . . 
. When I always talk about 
being something special, 
this is one of the games where we can ac-tually go out there and really change the 
game.”
However, Kentucky head coach Mark 
Stoops expressed his displeasure with 
Kemp’s statements Wednesday during the Southeastern Conference weekly telecon-
ference.
“I was furious,” Stoops said. 
“I was outraged and I talked to him 
about it. But the thing is, he was trying to 
make light of some friends that he has on 
(Florida’s) program. 
“But like I told him yesterday, ‘You 
think they’re going to hear all that? They’re going to hear the last five seconds of what ‘Cats running back talks smack

aligned,’” Muschamp said. “We had some times 
we got lined up late, we didn’t get in the right spot. It caused our eyes not to get into the right spot.”
In addition to the young secondary, perimeter 
run defense is something Muschamp and defen-sive coordinator D.J. Durkin want improved be-fore Florida opens its Southeastern Conference 
schedule against Kentucky on Saturday.
“(Eastern Michigan) gained some positive 
yards on us in that game on the perimeter and 
doing some different ways of getting to it, which is similar to things Kentucky already does, things they did against us last year,” Durkin said. “It’s 
part of what they already do so that’s obviously 
been an emphasis for us this week. Linebackers 
and DBs, all the same.”The Wildcats have scored seven rushing touch-
downs and are averaging 233 yards per game on 
the ground this season.
Patrick Towles, Kentucky’s starting quarter-
back, adds an extra dimension to the Wildcats’ offense. Towles leads Kentucky with 27 rushing 
attempts and has the ability to make plays with 
his feet.
“When you’ve got a quarterback that can 
move that can get out of the pocket when pres-sure’s coming and stuff like that, it’s always a 
challenge, because you’ve got to cover for that 
much longer, you’ve got to rush for that much 
longer,” Taylor said. “That’s always a challenge, 
but like I said before and like ‘Champ said, if we 
get good edge on the perimeter of the defense, we 
keep the quarterback in the pocket. There’s no-where he can run, so keep him inside the pocket, make him be a pocket passer. I think our guys are 
good enough to cover their guys.”14, ALLIGATOR § THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 11, 2014

comments as motivation
you said.’”
Linebacker Michael Taylor not 
only heard Kemp’s words, but he 
also responded with a few of his 
own on Twitter.
“Heard u were talkin shit but 
your Kentucky’s 3rd string back,” 
Taylor tweeted Wednesday.
But when asked if Kemp’s 
comments would serve as fuel to 
the fire for the Gators’ matchup with the Wildcats, Taylor said 
he and the rest of his teammates 
have enough motivation to per-form well after a 4-8 year.
“After the season we had last year and watching myself and how we played last year, there’s no extra motivation needed,” the redshirt senior said. 
“This whole summer, hearing 
all that stuff and seeing the re-sults of last year, no extra moti-vation is needed. That was taken into training camp and spring 
practices and everything we did 
leading up to this point.”
Sophomore cornerback Ver-
non Hargreaves agreed.
“At the end if we beat them, 
it’s a little something to rub in his face,” Hargreaves said. 
“We’re not looking too much 
into it.”Sidebar , from page 13IAN COHEN

Like any young team searching for conﬁ  dence, cred-
ibility and an identity, Florida is looking to test itself.
That’s partly why the Gators scheduled meetings with 
four top-20 ranked schools in the ﬁ  rst three weeks of the 
season – not because they envisioned four ﬂ  awless victo-ries and a chance to secure a spot at the top of the national rankings, but because they suspected they would lose.
And with most inexperienced teams, and especially for 
Florida, losing and learning are synonymous.
While No. 10 UF (3-2) plans on ending its two-game 
skid when it faces No. 13 San Diego (5-1) today, it knows wins don’t really count until December.
“When we scheduled last week’s matches on Thursday 
and Saturday, we knew it was going to be quite the chal-lenge for our team,” Coach Mary Wise said. 
“What we’ve talked to the players about is looking at 
the long term.”
It’s clear that Florida has a plan, formulated weeks be-
fore the season began and instilled into its players during the preseason.
First, Florida revamped both its offense and defense, 
primarily to accommodate for its offseason additions, but also to compensate for its losses. 
All-American blocker Chloe Mann and ﬁ  rst team All-
Southeastern Conference setter Taylor Brauneis are gone, 
replaced by freshman Rhamat Alhassan and second-year 
transfer Mackenzie Dagostino.
“Our offense is completely different,” senior Holly 
Pole said. “Starting with Mackenzie setting, and then ob-viously the freshmen coming in with Carli (Snyder) and 
Rhamat in there.”
Snyder worked her way into Florida’s rotation after 
impressing in her starting debut against Florida State 
last Thursday, and will prove to be a pivotal piece in the 
Gators’ reconstructed offense.
“Carli had a swing in set two (against Texas) that few 
players that have come through our program could have made,” Wise said. “The ball (came) from behind her, and 
to be able to hit off the blocker’s hands, it was pretty elite stuff.”
The defense underwent some ﬁ  ne tuning as well, plac-
ing more of an emphasis on digging.
“We changed some of the things we do defensively, 
me swing blocking and being more physical at the net… and we dig a lot more balls,” Alex Holston said earlier in the season.
Part 1 was a change in the Gators’ play style.Part 2 was the schedule, planned to test Florida’s 
freshmen, reﬁ  ne the team’s execution and cultivate court chemistry. 
It began when the Gators faced then No. 8 Florida State last Thursday and will continue this week in California 
when they play two top-15 ranked opponents.
“The whole idea of the pre-conference scheduling was 
to help us for the SEC in trying to play the best teams 
possible, and now we’ll do that on the road,” Wise said. 
“It’s not getting any easier, but we look at this weekend as 
another opportunity for our team to get better.”
All of Wise’s players, even the freshmen — and some-
times especially the freshmen — have bought in.
“It’s only going to challenge us and show us what we 
are able to accomplish,” Dagostino said.
“We always want tough teams,” Holston said.“Give us more,” Snyder said.More will assuredly come, beginning with San Diego 
today and No. 6 Southern California on Friday.
In the mean time, Florida will continue testing and 
tuning its game against elite competition, learning all the while and lying in wait for its real test — the NCAA tour-nament.THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 11, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15

Every new season brings with 
it a fresh start and clean slate, 
but for this year’s installment of 
the Florida women’s tennis team, 
there is more freshness than usu-al.
After the departure of graduat-
ed seniors Olivia Janowicz, Soﬁ  e Oyen and Alex Cercone — the winningest class in UF history — the Gators are now comprised of one junior, four sophomores and 
three freshmen.
With so much experience be-
ing replaced with so much youth, 
there is an obvious void left to ﬁ  ll 
in terms of talent and leadership.
Enter Brianna Morgan.
While only a junior, Morgan 
is the veteran of the team and the clear leader heading into the sea-
son. She is ranked No. 14 in the 
national singles chart of the In-tercollegiate Tennis Association Division I Women’s Preseason 
Rankings, matching the highest 
ranking of her career.
Florida coach Roland Thorn-
qvist said he thinks Morgan can get even better if she improves 
her ﬁ  tness this season.
“She’s got world class game,” 
said Thornqvist, entering his 14th 
year at Florida. “She didn’t have 
a very good summer, she’ll be the 
ﬁ  rst one to tell you that, but she’s been an animal in practice the 
ﬁ  rst couple of weeks.”
Two other Gators made the 
preseason rankings; sophomore 
Kourtney Keegan is ranked No. 51 in the singles chart and Belin-
da Woolcock, also a sophomore, 
is No. 89. The duo is also ranked No. 13 nationally in the preseason 
doubles ranking, a career-high 
for the pairing.
Despite the youth and inexpe-
rience, Thornqvist said he thinks 
the players this year will be able 
to push each other harder in prac-tice because of their collective ball-striking ability, something previous teams were unable to 
do.
“What I like about this team, 
even though we’re young, we re-
ally have some big ball strikers 
on this team,” he said. “Brianna, 
perhaps in the years past, had been the only one, so it’s been tough for us to match her in prac-tice, forehand to forehand, back-
hand to backhand.
“We have a few players on this 
year’s team who can go toe-to-toe 
with her from the baseline.”
One of the biggest changes in 
collegiate tennis this year is the no-ad scoring system, something that rule-makers hope will speed up matches and make them more 
exciting. It will be used in both 
singles and doubles.
Originally used in men’s Divi-
sion I tennis from 1975-1988, no-
ad means players will no longer 
have to win a game by two points. If the score is tied at three points each, the next point wins.
Coach Thornqvist said he has 
no experience with no-ad scoring in all his years of coaching, but he is excited to see what it brings to the game.
The ﬁ  rst opportunity to see 
the Gators and the new scoring system will be at the Duke Invi-tational in Durham, N.C., which begins Friday.Thornqvist said ﬁ  guring out 
chemistry between doubles pair-ings will be very important, and this tournament will provide him the ﬁ  rst real opportunity to see 
them in action against other com-
petitors.
Belinda Woolcock will also 
hope to repeat her success from this tournament a year ago. 
Woolcock made the singles 
white draw quarterﬁ  nals, and was part of the doubles team with Soﬁ  e Oyen that won the 
black draw title.
