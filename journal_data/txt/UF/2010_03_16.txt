Student dies in
highway accident
0 A TREE FELL ON THE CAR.
By ELIZABETH BEHRMAN
Alligator Writer
UF electrical engineering stu-
dent Thomas Hollister and his fa-
ther, David Hollister, were killed
Saturday when a pine tree fell
on their car, causing it to swerve
into a ditch.
Hollister and his father were
driving on U.S. Highway 98 on
their way to Carrabelle, a beach
town in the Florida Panhandle,
when the accident occurred, ac-
cording to Carolyn Mulbach, a
senior at Florida State Univer-
sity and Hollister's high school
friend.
Hollister was a transfer stu-
dent, and it was his first semester
at UF, Mulbach said.
Hollister, who was born in Af-rica and raised in Thailand, was
interested in traveling, playing
the drums and cooking, Mulbach
said.
"He was a really, really good
guy," Mulbach said.
Marcy Lee, Hollister's aca-
demic adviser, said she last saw
him the week before Spring
Break, when
he was getting
ready to register
for his summer
courses.
Lee said she

Hollister cause Hollister
had just recently
enrolled at UF, but, in the short
time she knew him, she could tell
what a sweet person he was.
"They're all like children to
me, so it's like I lost a child," Lee
said.

In a meeting of the UF's
Board of Trustees Committee
onEducational Policy and Strat-
egy on Monday, UF Student
Body President Jordan Johnson
said Student Government is
seeking alternative sources of
funding for renovating the ag-
ing student center.
"We're continuing to work
witharchitects," he said. "We're
looking to keep the train roll-
ing."
"Dr. Machen, some-
one's going to hit you
up."
Jordan Johnson
UF Student Body President
In the Feb. 23 and 24 SG
elections, nearly 56 percent of
voting students rejected the
proposed student fee.
SG is going to take a long-
term approach to the renova-
tion and is going to seek fund-
ing from multiple resources,
Johnson said.
The money may come from
the Public Education Capital
Outlay, which is a state pro-
gram that provides funds to
school districts, and UF admin-
istrative funds, he said.
"Dr. Machen, someone's go-
ing to hit you up," he said, jok-
ingly, turning to UF President
Bernie Machen.
The issue of Machen's sab-
batical payment was also re-
solved during the meeting.ter five years, he would be eligi-
ble to receive either a one-year
sabbatical, which is paid leave,
or the equivalent amount.
In January 2009, Machen
chose to take the money in four
annual installments.
After receiving the first in-
stallment of the money, it wasar
re
the university president to pay
federal taxes on all four install-
ments, even though he had only
received a quarter of the total.
To fix the problem, the
Board of Trustees voted to give
the rest of the sabbatical money
to Machen in a single lump
sum.
UF President Bernie Machen attended UF's Board of Trust-
ees governance committee meeting at the Emerson Alumni
Hall Monday afternoon.

Program offers rides
to cancer patients
0 THE PROGRAM SERVES 11
COUNTIES.
By MEGAN MERRILL
Alligator Contributing Writer
After winning her battle against
breast cancer, Barb Thomas now
lives to help drive the disease out of
other cancer patients' lives.
Thomas, 56, began volunteering
for the American Cancer Society's
Road to Recovery program about
a year and a half ago and has been
driving cancer patients from their
homes to treatment centers for their
appointments.
She said the program is needed
because many cancer patients are
so fatigued or on such strong pain
medication that they are not physi-
cally able to drive themselves.
"Family members or friends that
have not gone through cancer may
not completely understand it, so it's
nice to have other survivors with
you," Thomas said.
Margaret Shaw, a local Ameri-
Copyrighted Materialcan Cancer Society representative,
expressed an urgent need for volun-
teers for the program, which has 30
drivers for Alachua County.
She would like to have 100 driv-
ers for Alachua, Marion and the
other nine surrounding counties the
program covers.
To become a volunteer for the
Road to Recovery program, volun-
teer drivers are required to go to a
half-hour information session in
Ocala, where they will be trained
and put on the
Community company's lia-OutreaCh bility insurance.
Volunteers also
need to have an up-to-date driver's
license and would need to use their
own vehicle and gas.
Volunteer drivers do not have to
commit to any certain schedule.
Shaw said one of the best parts
of the program is the relationships
formed between the drivers and pa-
tient.
"It's a time to spend with a sick
patient who really, really needs your
help," Shaw said.

SPOTLIGHT ON THE SWAMP
UF employee helps in Haiti
By MEREDITH RUTLAND
Alligator Contributing Writer
Four days after the earthquake
hit, Jason Byrd was in Haiti count-
ing bodies.
Byrd, a UF forensic entomolo-
gist, works for the National Disaster
Medical System, a response team
that is part of the U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services.
As a forensic entomologist, he
uses bugs near corpses to deter-
mine how much time has passed
since death.
He made two trips to Haiti and
returned from his second trip on
Feb. 28. While there, he estimated
how many deaths there were, as-
sessed how many U.S. citizens
and foreigners were in the country
when the earthquake hit and set
up an identification system for the
dead.
Byrd also works as the associ-
ate director for the Maples Center
for Forensic Medicine at UF and
teaches honors courses in forensic
anthropology and forensic science.
He said the massive loss of life
in Haiti took an emotional toll on
him.
"Almost everyone that we talk-
ed to down there lost an immediate
family member," Byrd said.
He said Port-au-Prince con-
tained the main airport, the main
seaport, the seat of government and
the seat of the military, and it was
all destroyed.
"It crippled the country," Byrd
said.
He said some Haitians did not
have a lot of resources to begin
with, and many lost everything in
the earthquake.
"I've never been around a popu-
lation in any type of natural disas-
ter that had as little as they did," hesaid.
Byrd was there when the
6.0-magnitude aftershock hit, and
he said it shattered his precon-
ceived notions of what earthquakes
felt like.
"The ground isn't supposed toripple like water," Byrd said. "But
it does."
For Haiti to recover, Byrd said
Port-au-Prince needs money for
relief efforts and an urban plan to
prepare the city for another earth-
quake.

Jason Byrd, a UF forensic entomologist, flew to Haiti days after the
earthquake to count bodies and to ascertain the times of death.
Gentlemen's Showcase seeks to prove chivalry is not dead
One man will win a steak dinner
By RACHEL MANKO
Alligator Contributing Writer
Hannah Roberson said she hasn't had a
man escort her anywhere, open a door for her
or push in her chair for as long as she can re-member. Chivalry is dead, she said.
"If he is being a gentleman, it's because he's
trying to get into her pants," Roberson said.
But that's the mindset that the UF Network
of Enlightened Women, a conservative wom-
en's organization, is trying to change by par-
ticipating in the second annual Gentlemen'sShowcase, a contest for women to recognize
the gentlemen in their lives.
"We want to spread this message that chiv-
alry isn't dead and that gentlemen do exist.
We want to thank them," said Rachel Kopec,
the president of the UF chapter.
Women can enter any gentleman they
know on the group's Facebook fan page by
submitting a video stating what makes him agentleman. Anyone can vote by "liking" the
entry through March.
The winner will be announced March 31
and will receive a steak dinner for two to the
restaurant of his choice. The woman who en-
tered him will receive a Network of Enlight-
ened Women T-shirt and the book "Who Stole
Feminism?: How Women Have Betrayed
Women" by Christina Hoff-Sommers.

They create a profile and post their pictures with hopes of
finding a perfect match, but these UF students are not looking
for love -they are looking for roommates.
Through URoomSurf, a roommate-matching Web site, cur-
rent and incoming students search for compatible roommates
by creating an account similar to one they would create on a
dating service Web site.
They answer questions about topics including cleanliness,
preferred room temperature and political and religious be-
liefs.
There are 323 UF users, and most of them are incoming
freshmen, said Dan Thibodeau, co-founder of URoomSurf.
"We're kind of like Match.com for roommates," Thibodeau
said.

schools in Florida and 650 schools nationwide, he
On the said.
Web "Who you're going to be living with in college is
a big concern for students, and we've noticed that,"
Thibodeau said.
Franklyn Francois, an incoming UF freshman from Naples,
Fla., said he used URoomSurf because he wants a roommate
who shares similar values.
Users fill out a survey, but Francois said URoomSurf gives
students the chance to write more about themselves on site
profiles.
Francois has found two potential roommates on URoom-
Surf, and he applied to live in the Lakeside Residence Hall.
To make a URoomSurf account, students upload photos,
choose their college network and complete a profile. Then they
take a roommate survey, review their matches and communi-
cate with their top roommate picks.
Once they choose roommates, students fill out mutual re-
quest forms and submit them to their universities.
The site, which launched in February, has a Facebook-
like chat application for direct communication, and users can
make video profiles for more personal introduction, Thibo-
deau said.

No Excuses
Students should vote in
today's city election
he upcoming federal election cycle sure looks exciting
from here. Democrats are fighting for their political
lives, Republicans trying to make gains in both houses
of Congress and Tea Partiers clamoring for revolution.
And while we're at it, we're still feeling the buzz from the
2008 presidential election, even if "Yes we can" is turning
into "No, we still haven't."
If you're political junkies like us, you can't get enough of
exercising your civic duty. If that's the case, may we interest
you in a local mayoral election to whet your appetite for the
fall?
Gainesville voters will elect a new mayor today. Hope-
fully, students will have a better showing at the polls than
they usually do in city elections.
We'll forgive students for not getting involved in previ-
ous mayoral elections. Hardly anyone else in Gainesville got
involved, either. The last time Gainesville elected a mayor,
2007, the turnout was only 11 percent.
But the traditionally low turnout for city elections means
students' voices will be even louder if they turn out at the
polls.
Some city officials snub their noses at the student commu-
nity. Monica Leadon Cooper, one of the mayoral candidates,
said UF students "act like little children."
Having a larger than usual student turnout would force
city officials to pay more attention to the needs of students.
But if that's not enough to convince you to vote, just think
of it as getting yourself ready to vote in the fall, when Florida
will elect a new governor and U.S. senator. It takes practice
to bubble in a ballot.
Give Us Google
Students get a bad reparound Gainesville
sometimes for throw-
ing a metaphorical four-year
party, trashing the place be-
cause we don't have to live
with the resulting mess.
You'll hear this when any
vote on taxes does or doesn't
pass, when discussing stu-
dent driving habits or when
we throw the parties that
land us among the top 5 par-
ty schools.
But all 50,000 of us have
an opportunity today to fight
this image by giving back
to the community, in a po-
litically neutral way, without
spending a single cent of our
beer money: convince Google
to build the nation's fastest In-
ternet network in Gainesville.
The "contest" began when
Google began its search for
a town between 50,000 and
500,000 people (Gainesville:
about 117,000) to test its newnetwork, which would allow
you to download the contents
of a DVD in about 5 seconds.
What else it means will
take a lot of imagination, as
that increase is about 100 times
faster than what we're using
now. Already, the best minds
at UF, Shands and in Gaines-
ville's business community
are dreaming up ways to use
this technology. If you belong
to a club, play Internet video
games or take online courses,
we're sure you can come up
with awesome ideas, too.
With online start-ups, such
as Grooveshark already based
in Gainesville, it's easy to
imagine new tech job oppor-
tunities springing up here. By
helping to better Gainesville,
we might create more jobs.
If this sounds good, visit
Gig4Gvn.com for a list of easy
ways to get involved. The
contest ends in less than two
weeks, so get a move on mak-
ing "Go Gators" go faster.

TheLadders commercial is regressive
fully admit to being a cynic about advertising, but there's
one TV commercial that throws me beyond mere cyni-
cism and into just sputtering, angry confusion.
It's that damn commercial for TheLadders.com. The one
with the guy playing tennis.
TheLadders is an online job search service that purports
to specifically cater to job hunters looking for six-figure jobs.
The service itself is predicated on an elitist idea to begin with:
don't want to get caught up with all the riff-raff messing
around on Monster.com? Come to TheLadders, where you
won't have to even mingle online with the less fortunates.
And as unsavory as that might sound, I don't really have
too much of a problem with it. If they want to fill a specific
niche in the recruitment industry, more power to them.
But you don't need to revel in the elitism. And TheLad-
ders does exactly that with this commercial. The spot opens
with a WASPy-looking guy about to serve in a tennis match
when a woman runs in and collides with him going for the
ball. The crowd runs onto the court, cluttering it with their
rudeness, awkward racquet swinging and general rowdi-
ness. The man glares, annoyed, at the people who have ru-
ined his tennis game as a voice-over informs us, "If you think
about it, this is the trouble with most job search sites."
The trouble? "Whenyou let everyone play, nobodywins."
The first version of the commercial, which started airing in
January 2008, ended with the announcer saying what was
presumably TheLadders' tagline: "The premium job site for
only $100k-plus jobs, and only $100k-plus people."
Somebody at TheLadders must've realized just how aw-
ful that sounded (or, you know, somebody without a jackass
gene must've taken a moment to ask what the hell a "$100k-
plus person" is) because the version posted on its Web site is
tagged "MarchRevise:" the apparent revision ends with the
tagline, "Only $100k-plus jobs, and only $100k-plus job seek-
ers." Awkward, but better.
But now these ads are back, and they end with what ap-
pears to be a strange, middle-ground compromise betweenthe two: "Only $100k-plus jobs, and
only $100k-plus talent." Still bad.
Let's set aside the notion that
there's something both seriously
flawed and vaguely disgusting about
using money as a means of determin-
Joe Dellosa ing someone's personhood or talent.
letters@a iigator org We'll even set aside the uncomfort-
able imagery of the "riff-raff" crowd-
ing the guy including a bunch of mi-
norities, women and overweight people.
It's "$100k-plus people" with "$100k-plus talent" who
helped the economy nearly collapse, who euchred unsus-
pecting people out of house and home, who played games
with the banking system and stock market, and who threat-
ened the financial stability of t countless families who wanted
to live pleasant lives and send kids to college. This happened
under the watch and actions of people TheLadders would
term "$100k-plus people" with "$100k-plus talent."
I don't mean to paint with broad strokes. I don't doubt
that there are people who make well more than six figures
who do good, honest work, and I'm sure some of them even
work on Wall Street. And yes, a part of it may be a little per-
sonal: As someone who'd be thrilled to find any employment
post-April 30, six figures or not, I can't help but cringe when
these ads come on.
But one of the few good things to come out of the econom-
ic crisis was the national reassessment of what constituted
being successful: All of a sudden, being ridiculously rich isn't
a source of admiration as it once was. All of a sudden, Teach
for America and Doctors Without Borders and just selfless-
ness in general didn't just feel right -it felt aspirational.
TheLadders ads are predicated on bringing us back to a
last-decade way of thinking. And that's not just bad advertis-
ing; it's bad for us all.

Letters to the Editor
Reader urges UF students to vote for Wells in Gaines-
ville's elections
In today's elections for City Commission's District 4, stu-
dents should choose Randy Wells. Wells has a proven track
record of getting results and bringing people together.
Wells' outreach to UF students and his plans for the city
show that he will be a responsive commissioner who all
Gainesville residents can be proud of.
District 4 represents most of campus, including every
residence hall except for Lakeside.
It also includes much of the College Park and Duckpond
areas as well as the area southeast of campus along South-
west 13th Street.
As a small business owner and community leader, Wells
has served as president of the Duckpond Neighborhood
Association for four years.
He was also a chairman of the City of Gainesville's ad-
visory boards on affordable housing as well as bicycles and
pedestrians.
In addition to successful efforts to clean up local wa-
terways, improve neighborhood parks and schools and
promote energy efficiency, Wells has also been very ac-
tive in supporting the citywide Gig4GNV campaign to
bring Google's planned high-speed pilot program toGainesville. I have always been opposed to discrimination based on

Guest column
Student shooting raises concerns
We, as a community, are saddened bythe recent events in which a geography
Ph.D. student, Kofi Adu-Brempong was
shot by a University Police Department officer. It
appears this situation did not warrant the use of
deadly force and that UPD allowed the situation
to escalate out of control. Our questions seem to
be falling on deaf ears.
Did the UPD officer know that Adu-Brempong
suffered from a childhood case of polio? Did they
know that he needed a cane to stand on his own,
let alone to walk? Officers were present the day
before he was shot and knew about his condition.
The officers present said they acted out of fear for
Kofi's life. Then why use an assault rifle?
We are also disappointed that the UF admin-
istration was so late to address this issue with the
students, faculty/staff and community members.
The original statement released by President Ber-
nie Machen was only sent to residents of Corry
Village, and we feel that the entire student and
employee body of UF should have received a no-
tice immediately. It wasn't until well into SpringJeremiah Tattersall Break that Machen
Speak king Out sent an incredibly
vague letter to stu-
dents. More impor-
tantly, Machen refused to take a stand in support
of a victimized fellow Gator.
The letter itself encourages an independent in-
vestigation but ignores our calls to not utilize the
Florida Department of Law Enforcement. Given
that the police reports and stories are changing on
a daily basis, we would like the university to ini-
tiate its own investigation into immediately and
take student and faculty input along the way.
UPD handled the situation like a SWAT team
sting operation rather than negotiated with some-
one who was having a mental breakdown. Today
on Turlington Plaza at 10:45 a.m., students and
faculty are coming together to demand justice for
Kofi Abu-Brempong, and we want you to join.
Jeremiah Tattersall is with Studentsfor a Demo-
cratic Society, and Dave Schneider is with Student
Labor Action Project. This a guest column on behalf of
the Coalitionfor Justice Against Police Brutality.Guest column

My name is Craig Lowe and I am
running to use my proven leader-

When I was elected to city com-
mission, our city faced complex is-
sues. I brought in new leadership
which freed the utility to greatly
expand conservation strategies such
as efficiency rebates and loans avail-
able to all (including low income
families). Under my guidance, we
instituted a solar energy incentive
that is emulated around the nation.

Craig Lowe tions that
Speak king Out have helped
earn us our
reputation as
a progressive and inclusive commu-
nity. My opponents have opposed
or been simply unaware of the need
for these protections. This isn't the
kind of leadership we need.
This May, there will be no time
for on-the-job training. I am the only
candidate that will bring proven ex-
perience to the office at a time we
need it most. I have kept my com-
mitments. Please vote for me so I can
keep Gainesville moving forward.

Lowe, who as a city commissioner has

In an effort to bring more students out

Three-run fifth inning propels UF to win over Army
MANTHONY DESCLAFANI
GOT THE WIN IN 5.2 IN-
NINGS.
By ANTHONY CHIANG
Alligator Staff Writer
achia ng@alligator org
After seeing Army left
fielder Ben Koenigsfeld lay
out and snag a hard-hit ball in
the fourth inning, the Gators
took a different approach.
They turned what should
have been two easy fly outs
into two doubles in the fifth
to score three runs in the in-
ning and gain some separa-
tion from Army (5-4).
It was all No. 6 Florida
(12-3) would need, as it blew
past the Black Knights 9-3 on
Monday.
"We've got the advantage
because we play here a lot,"
UF coach Kevin O'Sullivan
said. "We've seen that a
lot and we've talked a lot
amongst our team that when
it does get twilight, the in-a Eerfield has to point and yell to
help the infielders out."
In the eventful fifth in-
ning, catcher Mike Zunino
hit a fly ball to shallow center
field that fell in between three
Black Knights for a two-bag-
ger, while Daniel Pigott hit a
lazy ball up in the air that the
dark sky helped turn into an
RBI double. Austin Maddox
then hit a single to knock the
other two runs home.
"It felt good. The sky
helped me out a little bit, but
I'll take what I can get," Pig-
ott said.
Florida didn't stop there.
With a 5-2 lead, short-
stop Nolan Fontana doubled
down the right-field line to
lead off the sixth and got to
third on an error. Third base-
man Bryson Smith, the next
batter, lined a single up the
middle to drive in Fontana
and extend the lead.
Then in the seventh, Pres-
ton Tucker ended his homer
drought and hit a two-run

Stamper should be drafted
A 11 Ryan Stamper did his senior
year was lead the fourth-best
defense in the nation in tack-
les with 78.
He was a team captain for the
Gators the last two seasons, when he
started 25 of the 28 games.
In the 2009 BCS Championship
Game, he tied Joe Haden for a team-
high 10 tackles to help UF win 24-14.
This season, when Brandon Spikes
couldn't play, it was Stamper who
stepped up in the star linebacker's
place.
He racked up 31 tackles and add-
ed an interception in the two games
Spikes didn't play -Vanderbilt and
Mississippi State -and against Ten-
nessee when Spikes left early.
Despite all he has done, Stamper
likely won't get drafted.
Not only will he not get drafted,but he has barely
drawn much at-
tention.
"My agent
and coaches and
Bobby Ca l .other peopleovi who have talked
Bobby's World to (NFL general
bcallovi@alligator org ma ges armanagers) are
telling me I can
go anywhere from the fifth round to
undrafted," Stamper said.
A 6-2, 235-pound linebacker who
hasn't registered a good 40-yard dash
time is rarely going to draw much
praise from analysts and scouts.
But Stamper managed to make
plays on a unit that was filled with
NFL talent.

Gators miss NCAA Tourney
By EUGENIO TORRENS
Alligator Writer
etorrens@alligator org
One year following a second-round loss
in the NCAA Tournament, Florida missed
out on the tourney altogether.
This season, the Gators (14-16, 7-9 South-
eastern Conference) were hit by graduation,
injuries and inconsistency, and landed in the
National Invitation Tournament. The NIT
committee released its field Monday night.
UF will host USF (15-15, 6-10 Big East
Conference) on Thursday. The Bulls are the
defending NIT champions.
"We are excited to be going to our third
postseason tournament in a row," Butler
said in a press release. "I'm excited for our
fans and that we'll get another opportunity
to play in front of them at home. South Flori-
da poses a great challenge and this should be
a great SEC-Big East battle."
UF had impressive marks on its r6sum6,
including sweeping the season series against
Mississippi State and a win over No. 23
Georgia.But the Gators failed to close out chanc-
es to bolster their r6sum6 with single-digit
losses to nationally ranked opponents No.11
Florida State, No. 3 Tennessee and Georgia.
Then came the r6sum6-smearing losses:
a 40-point beatdown at home to No. 21 LSU
and two to Alabama who finished 12-18 and
had only two other SEC wins.
UF started conference
play strong with consecu-
live wins, and sat above
.500 before faltering down
the stretch when center
Azania Stewart missed
six games toward the end
of the regular season -Butler the roughest part of the
team's schedule. It went 1-5 in that span.
A stark contrast between this year and
last was the production of graduated seniors
Marshae Dotson and Sha Brooks, who com-
bined for 30.4 points, 6.9 rebounds and 4.7
assists per game, respectively. This year, no
player in the team's starting lineup cracked
10 points per game.

would be useful on special teams.
With quarterback Tim Tebow unveiling
his new throwing motion and all the oth-
er studs working out at UF's Pro Day on
Wednesday, there will be plenty of coach-

Stamper's last chance -and one of his few
overall -to impress them.
An ankle injury kept him from play-
ing at the East-West Shrine All-Star Game,where he could have displayed his talent
on the field.
The injury will limit him in some of the
drills, but just talking to him for a couple
minutes shows Stamper has great knowl-
edge of the game and is an even better
person.
Those factors, combined with his game
film, should be enough to at least get him
drafted.

I have to prove people wrong and show
that 40 speed and testing ability isn't really
the most important thing when it comes
to playing football," Stamper said. "I feel
like I'm fast enough, I'm strong enough to
make plays and I think that's what's im-
portant because you can't teach football.
You either got it or you don't."
Stamper showed he had it in 2009, when
he proved he could be one of the best play-
ers on a star-studded defense, and at least
one NFL team should be able to see that.
HOT SHOTS
Stats shown are from Auburn and Mississippi
State games in SEC Tournament
Parsons once again takes the top
spot, this time for his consistency during
- Florida's brief SEC Tournament ap-
pearance. The junior forward dropped
21 points in UF's 78-69 win against
Auburn and added six rebounds and
two assists against the Tigers. He was
Chandler Parsons, F the only Gator to score in double-
digits in both games, as he followed
that performance up with 10 points and seven boards
against Mississippi State. It wasn't Parsons' best week in
terms of distributing the ball, as he only dished out three
assists, but he played well enough in UF's second-round
loss for the Gators to win had they gotten more than eight
points out of their starting frontcourt. Still, UF is back in
the NCAA Tournament for the first time in Parsons' college
career due largely to his growth into a versatile, consistent
player.
Stats: 31 points, 10-21 shooting,
13 reb, 3 ast, 2 st3-7 3-pointers, 8-11 FTs,If not for Boynton's 23-point
performance against the Bulldogs
on Friday, the Gators would have
suffered an ugly loss that may have
hurt their reputation in the eyes of
the NCAA selection committee. MSU
ran all over UF in the opening minutes
Kenny Boynton, G of the Gators' 75-69 loss, taking
an 11-point lead into halftime, and
Boynton was seemingly the team's only reliable option
early on. He finished shooting 8 of 17 from the field, 4
of 8 from three-point range and 3 of 4 from the free-
throw line while also recording three rebounds and three
assists and playing a team-high 37 minutes. The freshman
guard wasn't particularly effective on offense against
Auburn on Thursday -nine points, 33-percent shooting
and two assists in 27 minutes -but he didn't need to be
with the way Parsons and Alex Tyus were scoring.
Stats: 32 points, 11-26 shooting, 7-15 3-pointers, 3-5
FTs, 3 reb, 5 ast, 1 st
Parsons -18 Boynton -7
Tyus -11 Macklin -7
Walker -10 Shipman -1I11
Tyus was a scoring ma-
chine down low for the Gators- against the Tigers on Thursday.
The junior power forward
dropped 24 points, including
plenty of easy dunks on the un-
dersized Auburn frontcourt. He
Alex Tyus, PF was also impressively efficient,
hitting 68.8 percent of his shots
and putting up a season-high total in points in
just 29 minutes. He also grabbed five rebounds,
dished out two assists and blocked two shots.
Tyus followed up one of his better outings of the
year with a weak showing against MSU, scoring
just five points and grabbing five rebounds while
committing four turnovers and losing crunch-time
minutes to senior forward Dan Werner. Still,
his dominant performance against Auburn was
enough to get him the third-place spot this week.
