The alligator only had three 
legs and one eye, but it was 
still powerful enough to put a Gainesville man in the hospital.
A 9-foot gator attacked James 
Albert Wimmer on Monday in a small creek inside the Sweetwa-ter Branch section of Southeast 16th Avenue, also known as Tent City.
Wimmer was taken to Shands 
at UF to be treated for extensive injuries to his left arm, shoulder and shoulder blade.
“He was hurt bad,” said J.C. 
Goodwin, a friend who jumped in to save Wimmer.
Goodwin and his neighbor 
were washing down the hot day with a cold beer when Wimmer walked up to say hello.
Goodwin said Wimmer sat 
and talked, then said he was go-ing to the creek to cool off.
“He’s done it 100 times be-
fore,” Goodwin said.
The section of the creek next 
to Goodwin’s tent is about 5 feet deep and 5 feet across.
The alligator, known as Three 
Legs, lived about 50 feet down the creek from Goodwin’s camp. Those who visited the camp knew about the alligator and look ed-before they jumped in, Goodwin said.
But this time it was different.The alligator was submerged 
under a raised stone ledge where people usually jump off, which made it difﬁ  cult to see.
“He essentially jumped right 
on top of [the alligator],” Good-win said.
He heard Wimmer’s splash, 
but Goodwin said the second noise he heard sent chills up his spine.
“You can tell when someone’s 
in distress,” Goodwin said. “He let out a scream you couldn’t be-lieve.”
Goodwin ran down his make-
shift stairs that led to the creek and saw the alligator latched onto Wimmer around the upper part of his left arm toward his shoulder blade.
Wimmer got away and, withis

Gainesville had its plug pulled 
Wednesday afternoon.
V erizon Wireless and Gainesville 
Regional Utilities’ GRUCom reported 
customer complaints that their services had ﬁ  zzled Wednesday afternoon. 
Cellphones with V erizon Wireless 
plans were not working, and business-es and homes using GRUCom Internet were disconnected as well.
Customers’ Internet was restored as 
of about 6:45 p.m., said GRU spokes-woman Kathy Kopacz. She said GRU wasn’t able to determine how many connections were affected, but the ser-vice will have more information later.
She also said GRU hoped to deter-
mine what caused a ﬁ  ber optic connec-tion point near the city of Archer to fail, disrupting Gainesville connections. Kopacz said the point is part of a third-party facility some providers use.
“It’s kind of like a big pipeline,” she 
said.
V erizon Wireless spokesman Chuck 
Hamby echoed this. The cellphone ser-vice provider depends on a landline ﬁ  ber that feeds its wireless network.
“We’re really kind of at the mercy 
of that landline connection,” he said. Contact Clare Lennon at clennon@alliga-tor.org. Residents lose Internet,

UF students who missed the June 7 deadline 
for this year’s football ticket lottery will have 
another chance to register.
On Tuesday the UF Student Ticket Ofﬁ  ce an-
nounced its plan to extend the lottery registra-tion deadline from June 7 to June 22.
Mark Gajda, assistant athletic director for the 
University Athletic Association, said the ofﬁ  ce extended the deadline to increase registration.
“We thought it would be appropriate to cap-
ture more people, especially incoming fresh-men.”
The extension also gives students who do not 
check their email during the summer a chance to register, Gajda added.
Students will still need to pay $111 to be en-
tered into the lottery for Fall 2012 season tickets. The ﬁ  nal day to register will be June 22 at 5 p.m. Lottery results will be released June 25.
According to an email from the Ticket Ofﬁ  ce, 
students do not have to be currently registered for classes to enter the lottery or order tickets.
During the fall, however, 
undergraduate and graduate students need to be registered for at least 12 and six credit hours respectively in order to pick up their tickets. 
Students interested in 
registering can do so on the Ticket Ofﬁ  ce website.
The extension will give 
21-year-old environmental engineering senior Jahnavi Harris an incentive and a chance to win tickets despite missing the deadline in the past.

The Student Senate passed two 
amended budgets, which included 
giving about $250,000 extra to Stu-dent Government Productions.
The original Activity and Service 
Fee budget, which was $17,588,432, was passed in 2011. Since then, fee predictions changed and money could be reallocated. The adminis-trative fee that SG pays to UF was less than expected, Student Body Treasurer Juan Rodriguez said.
The budget also proposed to re-
duce funding for SG staff salaries and special events and to add to SGP and computer network support.
Budget and Appropriations 
Committee Chairwoman Christina Bonarrigo said the committee re-viewed every line item to find which areas needed more money. She said SGP requested more funding be-cause artist fees and venue prices increased.
Sen. Matt Pesek opposed the 
additional $253,522 given to SGP , which he said has not been fiscally responsible in the past.
Sen. Morgan V ollrath echoed his 
sentiments.“I have not been given any spe-
cifics what this money is going to go to,” he said. “I can’t sign off on it.”
However, Sen. Lauren V erno 
said giving money to SGP is giving money to the students because all the events held by SGP are for the students.
Sen. Daniel Landesberg com-
mended the bill’s authors for cutting waste in some areas of the budget. He said he found it necessary to give SGP more funding.
“Talent is very expensive these 
days,” he said.
The revised budget also allo-
cated $100,000 from SG to help keep Library West open 24 hours during weekdays in the Fall and Spring se-mesters.
The senators unanimously 
passed an amended SG-funded aca-demics budget, which lowered the Fine Arts College Council budget by $3,522.
Six performance groups that used 
to be funded by the college council are now funded by the School of Music, said Rodriguez.
“We were actually able to save 
money this year,” Bonarrigo said.

A new online program de-
signed to quickly register students 
to vote saw a successful unveiling Wednesday, according to officials at the Bob Graham Center for Pub-lic Service at UF.
The program, TurboVote, also 
alerts students by sending email and text reminders about election deadlines. Students can then re-quest absentee ballots from their local election authorities.Some of them have already 
started.
“More than 300 individuals 
have already accessed the system,” said Shelby Taylor, digital commu-nications director for the center.
Students will be mailed their 
voter registration or absentee bal-lot form. TurboVote completes the form and mails it with a postage-paid, pre-addressed envelope.
The creator of the program, 
Harvard’s Kennedy School of Gov-ernment alumnus Seth Flaxman, likened the program to Netflix.UF will be the fourth university 
in Florida to host TurboVote, fol-lowing Florida International Uni-versity, Miami-Dade College and University of Miami.
The Graham Center gathered 
enough donations to cover all costs of the program, Taylor said.
“There isn’t a cost for students,” 
she said. “[The department has] al-ready taken care of that for them.”
Students can sign up for the ser-
vice at http://ufl.turbovote.org.
Taylor said TurboVote hopes to  
create a 10 percent increase in the number of ballots cast by voters in the age bracket of 18 to 29 this year.
According to a 2009 Project Vote 
report on voter participation in the 2008 elections, fewer than half of 18-year-old citizens were regis-tered to vote.
Alex Kerrigan, a 19-year-old 
finance sophomore, would have fallen into that statistic. He said he was still waiting to register to vote.
“I don’t care about it until it’s 
the presidential election,” he said.
But Kerrigan said receiving 
email and text alerts about election dates would encourage him to par-ticipate in more elections.
“If I knew about it every time I 
got a text, I would vote in the elec-tion,” he said.

A program that aims to make life easier for un-
derrepresented students will be adding peer men-
tors in the fall.
The University Minority Mentor Program is a 
transition program within Multicultural Diversity and Affairs. The program helps first-year under -
graduate students in navigating the academic and social aspects of the university.
Jarrod Cruz, director of multicultural and di-
versity affairs at UF, said after entering the pro-gram the students are separated into groups called knowledge communities, which includes only stu-dents with the same or similar majors.
“The program seeks out mentors from UF’s 
faculty and staff from every college,” Cruz said. “Each mentor is assigned to a knowledge com-munity that all have majors within that mentor’s college.”
In previous years, the program only searched 
for mentors among UF’s faculty and staff.Having incoming students work with faculty 
and staff mentors may be helpful for the students academically, but it doesn’t help them with the so-cial aspects of campus.
UF upperclassmen applied to be peer mentors 
on a volunteer basis during the spring. Twenty-seven of them were chosen to mentor the incoming 
first-year students, said Kiwanis Burr, program coordinator.
Peer mentors can assist the 
students with their personal and social transition into the university.
Burr said this program is 
meant to increase access and retention among students who are traditionally underrepre-
sented in higher education.
“This program goes beyond just looking at 
mentoring as a flat relationship, where the mentor just feeds the mentee information,” Burr said. “We try to make sure that both the mentor and mentee are engaged with each other.”University Minority Mentor Program

A car accident early Wednes-
day morning left a woman trapped 
in her car for 10 minutes.
At about 5 a.m. Gainesville Fire 
Rescue responded to a two-car ac-cident at 1600 13th Street.
Rescue No. 11, an Alachua 
County ambulance, was on its way back to its station from a hos-pital when a car narrowly missed it at a high speed, according to an email from Jeff Lane, a GFR dis-trict chief.
The car, which might have been 
street racing, swerved to miss the ambulance and hit another car al-most head-on. The speeding car may have ran a red light.  
The ambulance driver and at-tendant saw the accident, began to treat the victims and called for assistance, according to Lane.
The injured driver was trapped 
in her vehicle for about 10 min-utes.
Firefighters used hydraulic 
jaws and cutter tools to free her.
The on-scene video recorded 
by GFR shows firefighters cutting the driver-side door off of her car.
She was transported to Shands 
at UF in stable condition.
According to Lane, the male 
driver of the first vehicle denied having any injuries at the scene.
Gainesville Police are inves-
tigating the accident to find the exact cause.
“This was a significant crash 
that narrowly missed the ambu-lance crew,” said Lane.

grabbing onto some roots in the river.
The gator swam, mouth open, toward Wimmer again, 
Goodwin said.
Goodwin grabbed a cinderblock he used to prop up his 
stairs to the creek.
“I busted the block on his head,” Goodwin said. “The ga-
tor went back under, did a full circle and swam away.”
Once the gator was back in his lair, Goodwin jumped in 
and dragged Wimmer away from the reptile while a neighbor called 911.
Gainesville Fire Rescue, Gainesville Police Department 
and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission responded.
Fireﬁ  ghters carried the unconscious man out of the water, 
within just 10 yards of the alligator, GFR District Chief James Lovvorn said. 
He was then taken to Shands at UF.Lovvorn didn’t know Wimmer’s condition when he com-
posed a press release.

Commission shot and killed Three Legs, Goodwin said.
Goodwin said he heard that Wimmer is doing well and

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
MONTGOMERY, Ala. — A man accused of kill-
ing three people at a party near Auburn University 
turned himself in Tuesday after a three-day manhunt that included a tense but fruitless search of a Mont-gomery home by police tactical units.
A Montgomery defense attorney said she ar-
ranged for Desmonte Leonard to surrender after get-ting word that his family wanted her help. Auburn Police Chief Tommy Dawson said the suspect was taken into custody at 7:57 p.m. by a U.S. Marshal at the federal courthouse in Montgomery.
His surrender was a low-key ending to a search 
that included the inch-by-inch scouring of the house by police armed with tear gas and spy gear. Hours after police conceded Leonard had evaded them at the house, Dawson said the suspect walked up the courthouse steps and surrendered peacefully to the marshal waiting just inside.
“It’s been a trying case for all law enforcement in-
volved,” Dawson said at a news conference.
Leonard, 22, is charged with three counts of capi-
tal murder in a shooting Saturday night after a ﬁ  ght over a woman. He is accused of wounding three oth-ers. The dead included two former Auburn football players, and a current player was among the injured.
Dawson said that Leonard was being booked into a jail in Montgomery and will be moved to Opelika, Ala., near the university for a ﬁ  rst court appearance on Wednesday or Thursday.THURSDAY, JUNE 14, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 5

Congrats, fellas.Have a fun and safe weekend, and be sure to check back next 
week.No one denies that the philosophical divide between 
Americans on the political left and right has only grown sharper in recent years. Bitter resentment 
and contempt for those of opposing views is commonplace. It often seems that the stronger the convictions or the more awareness one has of political issues, the more fervently one tends to see others as opponents.
One of the more polarizing issues seems to be the issue of 
same-sex marriage. People from both sides are sharply opin-ionated on the matter, and it seems that a mutually favorable solution is unlikely to present itself anytime soon.
But what if a mere change in tactics by one political per-
suasion could bring about a reversal of this situation where both sides could achieve their stated goals? I would suggest that there is, indeed, a solution and that it deserves consid-eration.
If right-leaning types oppose same-sex marriage on the 
grounds that it infringes upon their ability to religiously deﬁ  ne what has always been a traditionally religious sacra-ment, and left-leaning types tend to view the ability of same-sex couples to marry as a human-rights or personal liberty issue, which side is ultimately correct? Unequivocally , I say both.
So how do we break the impasse?I would suggest that it could be achieved by merely ap-
plying the following formula to the issue, “Is there any way to address this problem with more freedom, not less?”
As columnist and talk-show host Dennis Prager is fond of 
saying, “The bigger the government, the smaller the citizen.” If you can agree with this statement, then you can certainly see that there is a larger problem at the core of this issue.
At my own wedding nearly eight years ago, an aging El-
vis impersonator sang my bride and I the benediction, “By the power vested in me by the great state of Nevada and on behalf of the City of Las Vegas, I now pronounce you hus-band and wife.”
It wasn’t a particularly religious ceremony, but it still re-quired sanctioning by the state. In order for my wife and I to get mar-ried, we needed permission, sanc-tion and license from a state agency ﬁ  rst — a process by which we stood in line and paid a fee.
Since the mid-1800s, Americans 
have tolerated their government taxing and regulating their own 
most precious sacraments without giving it a thought. These same laws have never been shown to beneﬁ  t anyone, and have in fact caused division and strife on multiple occasions, as in the case of miscegenation laws that prohibited inter-racial couples from wedding. I ﬁ  nd this morally repugnant and a perfect example of government overreach.
If proponents of same-sex marriage were to shift tactics 
from demanding state recognition to the repeal of all state interference in intimate personal relationships, the matter would become merely one of contract law between private individuals.
Conservatives would remain free to exercise their con-
sciences within their homes and churches, and same-sex couples would be free to marry whomever they chose with impunity. The only loser would be the state, which would ﬁ  -nally be denied another venue to extort funds from a divided citizenry.
In my mind, such a liberty movement is long overdue.

When Facebook went public, its initial public offer-
ing gave investors the chance to own a piece of the massive social network via stocks. But with 
the development, the company is bound to change, and this time it’s not going to be just a revamped homepage.
Facebook users have always enjoyed a nearly ad-free 
homepage, with only a few easy-to-ignore ads popping up. However, with Facebook trying to ﬁ  gure out the value of each user, investors and advertisers are going to be trying out some new tools in order to ﬁ  gure out how many quar-ters they can squeeze out of users’ pockets.
Making Facebook a public entity could be seen as giving 
the users control, but how many average Facebook users are going to shell out about $40 for a single share of the stock? Once these users have a ﬁ  nancial obligation to the compa-ny, what are they willing to do to raise the price tag of their stock?
Rumored changes to the website include paying for “pri-ority” status updates so more people will see them. While this might be good for businesses trying to reach more customers, 
it could clog up news feeds with posts reminiscent of spam.
I think people who didn’t expect Facebook to try to nickel 
and dime its consumers were unaware of the actual status of Facebook — a company.
While Facebook’s humble beginnings and explosion of 
popularity were impressive, and its motives appeared altru-istic, it is a company after all, not a nonproﬁ  t. 
Companies are in business to make money — and Mark 
Zuckerberg has more than he knows what to do with — not to simply give away their products because they feel like being nice.
It all comes down to the money. How can Facebook make 
money on the users? By giving them the option to spend more to have a better-looking proﬁ  le than other people. Maybe by giving them the option to pay for a “priority” status update that everyone and their mothers will see (and whose mother isn’t on Facebook these days?). There is a pos-sibility that the future of Facebook might include paying for features we take for granted.
How much would you pay to “like” your friend’s photo 
of her adorable new puppy? I’m willing to bet a priority sta-tus update that Facebook will test the limits of its users’ wal-lets on each feature. 
Facebook is going to change drastically and quickly with 
more money surrounding its existence. But this might not be for the better. According to Facebook’s data, the website has more than 900 million active users as of this month. I’ll be interested to see how that number ﬂ  uctuates when the com-pany starts asking for chump change to access previously free features.

“It’s pretty evident that the GOP 
agenda is focused on rolling back the clock on women,” said Wash-
ington Sen. Patty Murray, chairwoman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Com-mittee, after the Senate vote on the Paycheck Fairness Act, which lacked a single Republi-can vote and failed to advance.
Was she serious?Forget the political ramiﬁ  cations of the 
vote on this bill — the substance of it and the real-world ramiﬁ  cations are what mat-ter and are the reasons that this bill did not make it.
The bill would have been an expansion 
on anti-pay discrimination laws already in place, including measures such as “salary negotiation training” for women and girls, increased powers for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to regulate busi-nesses and more legroom for women to ﬁ  le suits against employers they feel have dis-criminated against them.
Passing this law would have added up to larger burdens for businesses, including in-creased costs and time spent on paperwork, more government regulation and control of the employer-employee relationship, a slew of frivolous lawsuits and an early Christmas for trial lawyers.
After the defeat, Democrats repeatedly 
mentioned the high unemployment rate as a reason to pass this bill, stating that it would bring much-needed security to households where women contribute a signiﬁ  cant part, if not all, of the family’s income. However, the bill is just more hoops and red tape for businesses to deal with. Time and money that could be spent working and growing a business would instead be spent battling lawsuits and attempting to comply with new demands from the commission. Businesses could become more reluctant to hire women for fear of one of these lawsuits, which they would be likely to lose.
According to The Washington Post, the 
pay discrepancy between men and women has declined over the years. Today, there is no need for another law to deter businesses from discrimi-nating against 
women. Market laws work better for that anyway. In a free market, employers choose to pay competitive rates in order to draw the best employees to their company. Decades ago, the argument for legislation supporting pay equality could have been made. In fact, it was, and the Equal Pay Act of 1963 and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 still provide broad means for women to seek reparations when discrimination does occur.
Despite what the far left loves to portray, 
a statistical difference between two groups does not automatically add up to malevo-lent discrimination. While it may be factu-ally correct to say that on average, women make 77 cents on every dollar a man makes for the same position, upon further consid-eration of the factors that lead to the statistic, one can conclude that it is not discrimination so much as cultural and lifestyle differences between men and women that lead to this gap.
On average, women spend more time on 
maternity leave and at home with their chil-dren than men do and therefore have large gaps in their employment. According to a study commissioned by the U.S. Labor De-partment in 2009, “The gender gap shrinks to between 8 percent and 0 percent when the study incorporates such measures as work experience, career breaks and part-time work.” Since women do not, on average, log as many hours as men do, their average sal-ary is less.
Ultimately, no need for this legislation 
exists, and its passage wouldn’t have result-ed in its intended outcome anyway. These additional regulations would have worked more against women than for them, and it is things like this bill that really “roll back the clock on women.”

Kristopher Willis signed up for a foren-
sics class in high school thinking he was go-
ing to learn how to analyze crime scenes like they did on TV .
He was dead wrong.Willis quickly realized he was in a speech 
and debate class, and the word forensics had more than one meaning.
Although his passion for forensics was 
sparked by a word mix-up, his affiliation with forensics has stuck with him ever since.
Twenty years later, Willis is now a lec-
turer and director of the policy debate team at UF.
In the 2011-2012 season, Willis’ first year 
as the UF policy debate director, his squad jumped an unprecedented 62 places in the Cross Examination Debate Association na-tional ranking. The team entered the season ranked No. 68 out of 117 teams and ended the season ranked No. 6.
It was the best finish for the team in at 
least 25 years and possibly the best finish ever, Kellie Roberts, director of UF forensics, said.
Willis came in last year and has been an integral part of the success, Roberts said.
“[I] walked in with goals, direction and a 
plan,” Willis said.He set goals that were difficult to reach, 
but he worked with his squad to complete them.The team accomplished every one.“As of right now, Florida can beat up on 
Harvard,” said policy and debate captain and 20-year-old mechanical engineering ju-nior Jonathan Prescott .
He understands a lot of work is required 
to stay at the top, though. Prescott doesn’t want the team’s success to simply be a one-time national finish in the Top 10.
The debate team is working with the UF 
speech team to recruit new members during every freshman Preview session.
In addition, each debater is required to 
do background research on the upcoming debate topic and compile a 300-page docu-ment of the findings over the summer.
Successful debating requires a high level 
of preparation, hard work and dedication, Prescott said. Now that the UF policy team is considered one of the best debate teams in the nation, it has a target on its back.
Although personal success is important 
to Prescott, seeing his teammates succeed is the most rewarding part of being the team captain.
The squad’s philosophy is, “To the last 
man.”
“As long as a Florida team is in the tour-
nament, the whole team is there to help and support,” Prescott said.8, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, JUNE 14, 2012

It’s the morning of your job in-
terview. Your stomach turns, your 
feet tap against the floor and per -
spiration builds on your forehead. 
You want to make a lasting 
impression, but you worry your nerves will ruin it.
A Gainesville businessman 
thinks he has the answer to this problem.
Stephen Wycoff, the business 
development manager for Rem-edy Intelligent Staffing, said video resumes offer students and recent graduates an alternative way to promote and highlight themselves to prospective employers.
“It’s something out of the box 
but very professional,” Wycoff said. “You will remember him or her more than the five or six dozen resumes you look through.”
Through the video resume ser -
vice, which Wycoff added to the company last year, job seekers can record up to three 60-second seg-ments to answer interview ques-tions and can re-record responses until they’re happy with their an-swers.
Employers can access the profile 
through social media websiites or 
other programs 
like TalentRoost-er, a vendor that works with re-cruiters and sup-ports the video resume platform.
The hyperlink 
can also be at-
tached to emails.
Resume profiles contain much of the same information that is in-cluded on traditional resumes. Per -
sonality profiles and skill assess-ments can be included as part of the resume as well.
The video gives job seekers the 
chance to make a lasting impres-sion on prospective employers, Wycoff said. 
It also allows those employers to 
get an idea about who the person they could potentially hire really is.
Wycoff said once a person is 
hired, he or she pays a percentage of his or her salary to Remedy Intel-ligent Staffing for its services, based on the position and salary taken.
Mary Medina, assistant director 
for employer development at the UF Career Resource Center, said the center hasn’t seen many requests from employers but would con-sider using video resumes if more students wanted to use them.
Bethany Kiewel, 29, who was 
hired after using the video resume, said she chose it because it gives companies a more visual aspect of the candidate.
Kiewel said she was nervous 
when filming her answers, but it was helpful to have a professional opinion to let her know if her an-swers were satisfactory.
“Who you are is hard to portray 
on paper,” she said. “Video resumes offer the employer an insight into your personality.”

For twins Stephanie and Claire 
Browning, life is all cupcakes and 
pretty dresses — literally.
Managing their newly opened 
retro clothing and beauty store, Ingenue Avenue, and their two-year-old cupcake bakery, Sarkara Sweets Cafe, takes up so much of their time they have little room for much else on their schedules.
The identical duo opened In-
genue Avenue next to their cup-cake shop at 201 SE Second Ave. last Thursday to fill the down-town clothing void. 
The store specializes in bou-
tique bath and beauty products and new and used retro clothing — specifically dresses. 
Decorated with vintage Vogue 
magazines, silk tablecloths, flow-ers and miniature sprinkle cup-cakes, the shop is sure to appeal to your inner Grace Kelly.
“We have always admired the 
visual styles of past time peri-ods,” Claire Browning said.
Customers can find casual and 
formal dresses from the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, as well as vin-tage-inspired items that average $40.
“We have found that a lot of women are interested in more covering up,” Claire Browning said.
While the shop does have 
short dresses, it also carries hard-to-find ankle and knee-length wear suited for the workplace.
The twins said they named the 
shop after the French adjective “ingénu,” which means “young innocence.” 
Don’t be deceived by the twins’ 
gentle demeanor, soft brown curls, freckles and sky-blue eyes. These ladies have been develop-ing a plan for Ingenue Avenue for years and have just been wait-ing for an opportunity.  
“It was just sitting in a file on 
our computer — we had a logo designed, the name and every-thing,” Stephanie Browning said.
The opportunity came about 
when the clothing store next to Sarkara Sweets closed and they were able to rent the space and expand their business.
The two said it is always excit-
ing and nerve-racking when they open a new shipment since they do not see the clothing before. They order from a wholesale vin-tage dealer in California.
Holding up a brown and 
white dress they call the “pilgrim dress,” they joke that they have  received some off-the-wall items.
“You take a gamble when 
dealing with retro,” Stephanie Browning said.
Their interest in retro design 
and clothing styles is not only apparent in the products they carry, but also in the hand-picked design they incorporate in the clothing and cupcake shops.
Ingenue Avenue is a business 
venture as well as a labor of love for the sisters.
“When we were younger, 
Steph wanted to go into fashion design,” Claire Browning added.
Stephanie gave up that dream 
so her sister could pursue arche-ology at UF. Now, the Browning sisters have opened their books to fashion again and plan to use the same customized touch that they use in Sarkara Sweets.
“In a month or so, we will be 
offering beauty products made-to-order, just like the cupcake shop,” Stephanie Browning said.
Just as in Sarkara Sweets, 
where you can pick your cake flavor, filling, icing and toppings, Ingenue Avenue will offer that same flexibility with bath prod-ucts, where the customer can pick ingredients and scents.
“We’ve seen a really wide-
spread customer base,” Stepha-nie Browning said.
The sisters were surprised that the first sale of their women’s clothing store was to a man.
“He bought a bath bomb for 
his girlfriend,” Stephanie Brown-ing said.
“It’s suited for young women,” 
Claire Browning added. “We’ve made most of our sales to women 25 to 40.”
Despite the summer months 
being generally slower for busi-nesses, the Brownings have planned in advance and set aside money to accommodate.
“Summer everywhere is a 
little slower,” Claire Browning said. “But we enjoy the chance to interact with the customers.”
Summer in the cupcake shop 
is filled with more catering than usual, according to the sisters.
“People have time to celebrate 
events I guess,” Claire Brown-ing said. “We’ve done weddings, special events, galas, bar and bat mitzvahs and baby showers.”
The shops are open Wednes-
day to Sunday, but thesisters work every day .
They look forward to train-
ing a manager and having more time for hobbies — cooking and gardening for Claire and sketch-ing, fashion design and music for Stephanie.

Ted Kubisek stood in front of the fan to combat the heat 
during the shop’s last week of being open for business. He 
spoke to customers and employees in a way that shows he’s known them for years.
After 21 years owning and operating Spin Cycle, it was 
time for a change.
By June 19, the warehouse, home to a bike shop, screen 
printing business and music venue, is set to clear out of the building it has been in for more than a decade.
“I’ve done it for so long that I don’t want to do it for -
ever,” said Kubisek, 39.
Monster Press Printing, the screen printing business, 
will continue after the bike store closes.
The shop is closing because Santa Fe College is ex-
panding its downtown campus into Spin Cycle’s building on University Avenue.
“That has given us, myself, my family a chance, a 
breaking point that after 21 years seems to make sense,” Kubisek said.
Kubisek, a Gainesville native, originally opened the 
shop on Northwest 13th Street in 1991. He graduated from high school at a time when mountain biking was an emerging sport.
“I was already working in a shop since I was 12,” 
Kubisek said, “so by the time I graduated high school, I was well-trained and experienced.”
From there, Kubisek started running someone else’s 
store, where he sold a lot of high-end and emerging mountain bike equipment.
He and some friends decided to open Spin Cycle short-
ly after.
“It was very successful right away,” Kubisek said. 
“People would travel from other towns to come to our store. We had a lot of organized rides and a lot of com-munity participation.”
The venue Spin Cycle on Tap was added two years ago. It participated in Gator Stompin’ and has hosted bands and variety shows.
The timing of Spin Cycle’s opening prevented Kubisek 
from finishing college. He went to SFC briefly but never earned a degree.
“I regret that decision,” Kubisek said.He wants to work toward a degree, among other things, 
after the store closes.
“I certainly look forward to what it is that my family 
and friends are going to be doing,” he said, “but whatever it is will be free from having to do this.”
Along with continuing Monster Press Printing, he and his wife, Jill Kubisek, 33, plan to travel to Washington, D.C. with their two children, Vander, 2, and Cadence, 10 months, to campaign for President Barack Obama.
“That’s a plan, that’s a dream,” Ted Kubisek said. “I’d 
like to witness a presidential inauguration once in my life-time.”
Despite all of the excitement in new beginnings, 
Kubisek will miss seeing his children grow up in the bike shop.
“That’s one of the saddest parts — that I don’t get to 
raise my children here,” he said.10, ALLIGATOR §  THURSDAY JUNE 14, 2012

Waiters who carry trays of steamy om-
elettes and grits flutter in and out of a 
door with hundreds of half-smudged fin-gerprints.
Fathers dole out dated relationship ad-
vice to daughters over glasses of orange juice and bottles of Crystal Hot Sauce.
As an old man finally mounts his high 
chair and rests his elbows on the sticky bar, a waitress brings him his standard dark black coffee with a warm smile and a “Hey, Charles.”
Ivey’s Grill offers a continental-style 
brunch menu with locavore flair.
The experience begins with what seems 
like an orchestra of greetings from the staff in the dining room, which is adorned with paper mache animals, paintings of Mu-hammad Ali and plants hung at random.
After you take your seat and have your 
drink order in place, you can settle in to listen to the room.
The music, which moves from John 
Williams orchestral music to West Coast jazz guitar to a patriotic lone French horn, is accompanied by a conversation some intellectuals are having about Leonard Bernstein.
All of the unlikely parts mix well to-
gether, much like the food.
The Smoked Salmon Benedict is an 
amalgam of tart hollandaise sauce, hicko-ry-smoked salmon and perfectly poached eggs all perched on top of a crisp split English muffin.
Ivey’s Grill smokes its salmon with 
brown sugar and hickory chips in the morning, only hours before it is served.
The sweet smoke of the salmon compli-
ments the two perfectly poached eggs.
Hollandaise sauce, which is the emul-
sification of butter, egg yolk and lemon, used its lemon to cut the fattiness of the fish and add another creamy texture to the eggs, bringing the whole dish into harmony.
The potatoes were pan-fried chunks 
seasoned with rosemary, oregano and lots of pepper.
Although the pepper from the potatoes 
gave a good spice, the potatoes themselves were cold.
Where the potatoes lacked in warmth, 
the service didn’t.
Every member of the wait staff made 
sure drinks were full, people had their hot sauce and that you were going to get the pancakes when you come back.
It is easy to get a first impression of a 
staff in one visit, but it takes more than 
one trip to a restaurant to see what a menu is like, so lunch it was.
The crab cake sand-
wich, Matt & Tomei’s Crab Cake Sandwich, proudly displayed sweet chunks of crab 
from Northwest Seafood, along with ca-pers to add a bit of texture and flavor.
To add even more texture and flavor, 
the cake is topped with lettuce and a dill mayonnaise.
Just counterclockwise from the sand-
wich sat an unlikely soloist, soba noodles.
The buckwheat noodles, ubiquitous to 
almost every Japanese home, took a trip to Thailand as they were tossed with peanut sauce, chopped peanuts, green onions and red cabbage.
The green onions helped to cut through 
the rich grit of the peanuts.
What would have truly rounded off the 
noodles as a Thai dish would have been just a little spice, which would have also worked well with the crab.
My mouth, having just been subject-
ed to dill mayonnaise and peanut sauce, looked for something to cut all of the vel-vety textures.
And there it was. Like the somehow-
overlooked hot girl with glasses and awk-ward bangs from your high school art class. I finally realized how beautiful and perfect it was at that moment, three mea-sly slices of watermelon.
The cooling organic watermelon, from 
Bellevue Gardens Organic Farms, mel-lowed the flavors and cut through the tex-tures of the meal.
Throughout the dish, the balance of 
flavors and textures was never an after -
thought and it showed.
Ivey’s Grill manages to harmonize dif-
ferent local flavors into cohesive meals for all to enjoy.

John Pinckard, alumnus of the 
UF School of Theatre and Dance, 
helped produce “Clybourne Park.” The play won a Pulitzer Prize in 2011 for drama and took home “Best Play” at the Tony Awards Sunday night.
“Clybourne Park” is loosely 
based on historical events and is inspired by Lorraine Hansberry’s “A Raisin in the Sun.” According to the Los Angeles Times, it is “a sharp-toothed satirical drama about the vagaries of race and real estate.”
Pinckard graduated from UF 
in 1998 and is now part of JTG Theatricals, a New York produc-tion company. The company is made up of three producers.
The UF College of Fine Arts 
and the UF Alumni Association selected Pinckard for the 2009 Outstanding Young Alumni Award.
Nick Erkelens, a senior in the 
acting program of the UF School of Theatre and Dance, got a chance to meet Pinckard during the Spring semester.
Pinckard was invited to Gainesville by Florida Players, a student-run theater company that allows students to showcase their work. Florida Players is spon-sored by Student Government.
Florida Players invited Pinck-
ard down from New York to teach a master class. Master classes pro-vide opportunities for students to meet professionals and have their work critiqued. The guests also give speeches about their experi-ence in the field.
Erkelens said Pinckard was 
originally in 
school for light-ing design be-fore he switched to production.  He was work-ing on “Cly-bourne Park” when he came 
to Gainesville for the class.
Erkelens said Pinckard ex-
plained that he was willing to support anyone pursuing a craft in theater — whether it be set de-sign, production or acting.
“He was super down to earth,” 
Erkelens said. “He gave us his card and said we should contact him if we travel to New York. He was really interested in having a Gator community up there.”
Pinkard has no plans to slow 
down after “Clyboune Park.” He is currently committed to eight plays for the next three to five seasons as well as two feature films. One play in particular,
“Tales of the City,” is an auto-
biographical jukebox musical. Its music is by Scissor Sisters, and the play is about the career of legendary producer/director Hal Prince, directed by Prince him-self. He is most notably known for his direction and production of plays such as “West Side Sto-ry,” “FIddler on the Roof” and “The Phantom of the Opera.”
“He is the Steven Spielberg of 
Broadway,” Pinckard said.  “He took an interest in my producing career and is my mentor.”
For Pinckard the transition to 
success wasn’t immediate, and he, like others, spent time as a struggling artist in New York.
“It’s kind of like losing weight, 
you don’t notice day by day, you notice incremental changes re-spectively,” he said. “It’s kind of like that David Bryne song. ‘This is not my beautiful house, this is not my beautiful wife, how did I get here?’”12, ALLIGATOR §  THURSDAY JUNE 14, 2012

Students with a taste for beer, Pac-Man and live mu-
sic can now enjoy all three without leaving the comfort 
of their barstools.
Mars Pub and Laser Tag transformed its laser tag 
arena into an arcade. Eight cabinets feature racing simu-lators, rail shooter and classic arcade games: Frogger, Galaga and Donkey Kong to name a few.
Air hockey and billiards tables have been added to 
the 3,000-square-foot room, too. The games cost any-where from 25 cents to $1 to play.
“We’re trying to keep the more retro games everyone 
loves,” said Melissa Del Valle, a co-owner of the bar. “Skee-Ball has been the No. 1 game people have been asking for.”
The north side of the room is dedicated to live mu-
sic performances. Six shows are scheduled for July, she said.
The renovations stemmed from a lack of demand for 
laser tag during summer months, when fewer students attend UF.
“We figured arcades are reminiscent of summers 
when you were a kid,” Del Valle said.
The bar will add a jukebox to the arcade next week, 
and three more arcade cabinets will be installed in the near future.
The bar’s laser tag equipment will receive mainte-
nance and upgrades during the summer, Del Valle said. She said she wasn’t sure if the bar’s laser tag arena would be redesigned to fit around the arcade cabinets.
“We always intended for the laser tag to come back in 
fall,” she said, “but the arcade is doing really well.”Mars Pub and Laser Tag transforms into old-school arcade

“I still can’t believe Missouri lost to Norfolk State.”
Patric Young, UF center
(@BigPatYoung4)  JOE MORGAN
 Alligator Staff Writer
   
 After losing to South Carolina 
in the College World Series ﬁ  nal 
last June, Florida has had the two-time defending national champi-ons’ number this season.
  The Gators took two out of 
three in Columbia in late March, and they eliminated the Game-cocks from the Southeastern Con-ference Tournament with a 7-2 win May 25.
  “It doesn’t mean anything,” 
Greg Larson said of Florida’s suc-cess against South Carolina during the 2012 season. “In Omaha, it’s just one game, and you just look forward to that one game. I don’t think us beating them three out of four means anything to them.”
  However, when the Gators (47-
18) take on the Gamecocks (45-17) Saturday night at 9, one number will stand in Florida’s way: 21.
  South Carolina has won 21 con-
secutive postseason games dating back to the 2010 College World Se-ries. A loss to Oklahoma on open-ing night two years ago marks the last time the Gamecocks have ex-perienced postseason defeat.
  “Streaks or no streaks, we’re 
all 0-0 in Omaha right now,” Josh Tobias said.  Another South Carolina streak 
matched by Florida this season is consecutive College World Series appearances. The Gators and Gamecocks are each making their third straight trip to Omaha. While Florida’s upperclassmen have been a part of all three trips, Saturday’s game will mark the ﬁ  rst College World Series experi-ence for several Gators.
  “It’s not going to hit me until 
I get there,” Tobias said. “You’re playing the best competition ev-ery day, and you’re going to be on the biggest stage in your life, besides the major leagues. That’s one of the reasons why I chose this school.”
  For Florida’s returning play-
ers, facing South Carolina at TD Ameritrade Park brings up mem-ories from how the 2011 season ended. However, the Gators say last year’s loss is a moot point.
  “I don’t think there’s any bit-
terness,” Larson said. “We’ve kind of moved on from last year. We’re trying to make this year count.”
  Brian Johnson added: “Last 
year doesn’t matter. It is what it is last year. We’re all grateful to be back with this opportunity and a fresh start, and we’re ready to go.”
  With nine players likely to leave 
Florida for professional baseball following the College World Se-ries, a sense of urgency has set in. As the nation’s top-ranked team, the Gators are favored to win their ﬁ  rst national championship.
  “The ﬁ  rst year we went out 
[to Omaha], my sophomore year, we were kind of happy just to be there,” Larson said. “Last year … we were deﬁ  nitely a little bit more motivated. This year is kind of the same attitude. We’ve been there, we want to get it done.”
  Tobias added. “I expect to win 
it. We got there last year, and I ex-pect to win the whole thing this year.”

 Florida faces familiar foe in College World Series opener
David Carr /  Alligator Staff
Greg Larson pitches against North Carolina State in the ﬁ  rst game of the NCAA Super Regional on June 
9. The senior pitcher has been to the College World Series three times during his career at Florida.
  
 Whether the Gators win or 
lose this year’s College World Series, Brian John-
son will always be remembered in Omaha. After an apparent Johnson home run was called a ground-rule double in Florida’s 8-4 win against Texas last season, instant replay has been implemented for the 2012 Col-lege World Series.
  “All that mattered last year is we 
won the game,” Johnson said. “I think [the new rule is] pretty cool.”
  The NCAA has wisely limited 
instant replay to reviews regarding home runs. The three scenarios are: deciding if an apparent home run is fair or foul, decid-ing whether a batted ball left 
the playing ﬁ  eld for a home run or a ground-rule double and spectator-interference plays on home runs.
  Dennis Poppe, the NCAA vice 
president of football and baseball, discussed the rule change Tuesday. Limited instant replay

 Junior Tony McQuay has had a nice year 
in 2012. The sprinter started off winning 
the U.S. Championships in June, then won his ﬁ  rst NCAA indoor title in the 400 me-ters and last week he won his ﬁ  rst NCAA outdoor title in the 400 meters as well as Florida’s ﬁ  rst 4x400-meter relay NCAA title.
  But the year isn’t over yet.  On Wednesday, McQuay said that this 
will be his last year running for Florida.
  “From freshman year to now, it has been 
a long journey,” McQuay said. “It’s been a great experience for me. To go out with a national title, to break school records and go down in history, especially since it’s my last year here, words can’t describe how I feel.”
  Despite turning profes-
sional, he intends to still train on Florida’s track as well as ﬁ  nish getting his 
degree. However, Mc-Quay hasn’t decided who he will be running for yet. 
  “I’m still not sure who 
I’m going to sign with yet; I’m still in the process of 
deciding where I’m going to go,” McQuay said. “Nike and Adidas are the two of my biggest ones.”

Esophageal Spasm
Ohio State coach Urban Meyer took issue 
with the NCAA policy that forbids funding high school athletes’ unofﬁ  cial campus visits. He called the rule “anti-student-athlete.” 
“We’ll see how it works,” he said. “I 
can tell you every umpire wants to make 
sure they got the call right. A home run, that’s a big play. They want to make sure they get it right.”
A change in the game of this magni-
tude has drawn both praise and ire. Al-though not directly, Florida coach Kevin O’Sullivan and N.C. State coach Elliott Avent clashed on the issue last weekend.
“I think it’s a good thing,” O’Sullivan 
said Sunday. “I think that anything that can help the umpires get the call right I think is a good thing for this sport. That’s not a knock on them not getting the call (on Johnson’s home run) right last year.
“That’s the other thing that makes this 
sport so good. There’s decisions sometimes in the game that aren’t right and you got to battle through those decisions.”
Avent brought up instant replay after 
the Gators’ 9-8 victory against the Wolf-pack on Sunday. N.C. State shortstop Chris Diaz struck out looking on a controversial called third strike to end the game. A furi-ous Diaz chased after home plate umpire Steve Corvi to argue the call.
“Any way, it’s baseball,” Avent said. 
“It’s what makes it the great, great game. That’s why there should never be replay. I think replay has destroyed football and everything.”
Like Avent, I consider myself a baseball 
purist. I like outdoor stadiums, and I be-lieve the designated hitter is an atrocity. “Take Me Out to the Ball Game” should be the only song played during the seventh-inning stretch, and, for the love of God, why the hell is there a pool bar at Marlins Park?
However, I support the introduction of 
limited instant replay. I put emphasis on limited. I support the rules established by the College World Series, and I even think it would be okay to review whether a run-ner is safe or out.
Each team should receive one challenge 
per game. A successful challenge earns a second. After that, no more, so choose your battles wisely. There will be no coun-ter challenges. No booth-ordered replays.
But here’s where I draw the line: balls 
and strikes. Everybody has his or her own strike zone. It varies on the size of the bat-ter and the eye of the beholder. The strike zone should forever remain untouched by instant replay. We don’t need the techno-logical equivalent of a fax machine like Red Sox manager Bobby Valentine suggests.
Critics complain about instant replay 
and suggest it will slow down an already untimed game, but if time is a concern, there are plenty of other sports with clocks.
Baseball is a human game and, like us, 
it’s error-prone. We have used technology to improve our lives. Why not our games?

Players to Watch in Omaha
THE REGULARS
RF Preston Tucker – The Tampa native 
returned to Florida for his senior year to help the Gators win their first national champion-ship. Tucker is doing his part at the plate with a .400 (8 for 20) batting average, eight runs and four RBI in five postseason games. 
Tucker hit the 11 th postseason homer of his career to  ead off the fourth inning against North Carolina State on Sunday. The solo shot tied the score 1-1 and kicked off a four- run inning for the Gators. Last year, Tucker had a team high six RBI during the College World Series, but he only batted .227 (5 for 22).
C Mike Zunino – Florida’s catcher is arguably the best baseball player headed to Omaha this weekend. Selected as the No. 3 pick by the Seattle Mariners in this year’s MLBAmateur, Zunino leads the Gators with 19 home runs, 64 RBI and a .678 slugging 
percentage. In five postseason games, the junior catcher is batting .316 (6 for 19) with three homers, seven runs and nine RBI. Zunino ranked second for the Gators with a .316 (6 for 19) batting average during last year’s College World Series.THE FIRST TIMERS
P Jonathon Crawford – The sophomore right-hander makes his first trip to Omaha after he was left off the Gators’ CWS roster last year. Crawford threw a no-hitter in the NCAA Gainesville Regional opener against Bethune-Cookman on June 1. He gave up 
three earned runs in 3.2 innings against N.C. State on Sunday, but a two-hour, 23-minute rain delay took a lot out of Crawford,who had thrown 17 pitches in two perfect innings before play stopped. He has 3.13 ERA and leads all starters with 70 strikeouts.
2B Casey Turgeon – The freshman middle infielder made a no-hitter-saving grab for the final out in Jonathon Crawford’s historic gem against Bethune-Cookman on June 1. He has earned praise from coach Kevin O’Sullivan for his glove work, but Turgeon 
has made waves his bat during the postseason. Named theMost Outstanding Player of the NCAA Gainesville Regional, Turgeon has hit .474 during the postseason with six runs scored.THE QUESTION MARKS
P Austin Maddox – Maddox has made his claim as one of the best closers in college baseball in 2012. He boasts a 2.50 ERA and leads the Gators with 12 saves. However, he has struggled on the mound recently. In Florida’s Southeastern Conference Tourna-
ment semifinals loss to Vanderbilt, Maddox gave up five earned runs, five hits and six stolen bases in the ninth inning. In the second game of the NCAA Gainesville Super Regional against N.C. State, Maddox entered back-to-back innings with one-run leads, but surrendered the Gators’ advantage both times.
P Karsten Whitson – Whitson was a key player in Florida’s 2011 CWS run, but the road back from a groin injury last fall has limited his effectiveness as a starter this season. As a result, Gators coach Kevin O’Sullivan has held Whitson out of the starting rotation so far this 
postseason. However, Whitson showed encouraging signs in a rare relief appearance against N.C. State on Sunday. Although he only recorded two outs, he did not give up a single hit. However, Whitson walked two batters in his brief outing and control remains an issue for the sophomore.

Tony McQuay runs in the men’s 4x400 relay at the NCAA Outdoor Championships on June 9. The 
junior sprinter won individual national titles in the 4x400 relay and the 400m last weekend.
McQuay will compete in 
400m at the Olympic trials
helped the men earned all four NCAA 
titles – three indoors and one out-doors. He also won three individual NCAA titles, as well as ﬁ  ve Southeast-ern Conference titles. 
  “Everything just happened so fast 
for me with my collegiate career,” Mc-Quay said. “I feel like I just got here. I’m not ready to leave, but I have to make the best decision. I wish I could do it all over again.”
  The eight-time All-American holds 
two school records. He set the outdoor record for the 400 meters at the NCAA Outdoor championships with a time of 44.58. 
  His most impressive record came 
in his last event as a Gator when he anchored the 4x400-meter team to a world-leading time of 3:00.02 at the NCAA Outdoor Championships. Flor-ida’s new record edged out its previ-ous one set in 2010 by less than a half second.
  “When I looked up at that clock I 
said, ‘Wow, we just did that,’” he said. “It was such an emotional moment for me.”
  With his collegiate career behind 
him, McQuay will now be focusing on his professional one starting with the Olympic trials on June 22. After set-ting a new personal record in the 400 meters last week, McQuay feels con-ﬁ  dent about the performance he will have in Eugene, Ore.
  “It’s a big stage, but I raced some 
of those guys on my way to making the world team. I’m not going to go in there scared of them, I’m going in there hungry,” McQuay said. “Who-ever wants it more is going to get that spot, but after running a [44.58] I don’t think I have too much to worry about. Anything can happen though, but they’re going to have to bring it be-cause I’m bringing it.”

  You’ve heard of ultimate frisbee — you 
know, that game with the hippies run-ning around barefoot, throwing around 
a disc and enjoying Janoris Jenkins’ favorite pastime.
  Chances are you’ve come across it at the 
park or outside your dorm room. You may have even played a time or two. 
  But ultimate has become much more than 
that friendly game of pick-up..   Just look at the UF men’s and women’s club teams.
  During the spring semester, you can see 
them practicing at Lake Alice Field several times a week. Not to mention the regular con-ditioning workouts, and the tournaments they compete in throughout the country.
  It’s no surprise both are premier college ulti-
mate teams, ranking in the top 30 nationally — the women recently placed 13th at the 2012 D-I College Women’s Championships, and the men own national titles in 2006 and 2010.
  Florida has become a national powerhouse 
in the ultimate scene, producing some of the top talent in the country each year. Most notable is Brodie Smith, who has gone on to become a YouTube hit, creating ultimate tutorials and even a Frisbee trick-shot series that has gone viral and rivaled the likes of Dude Perfect, the basketball trick-shot artists.
  Smith now plays professionally in the 
American Ultimate Disc League, headlining for the Indianapolis Alley Cats.
  You heard right, it’s a professional sport 
now. You can replace those hippies with bona ﬁ  de athletes — yes, the ones who play “real sports” like football and basketball — and imagine the only thing being passed around now is a disc.
  The AUDL, cur-
rently in its inaugu-ral season, consists of eight teams located in the Northeast and Midwest. Expansion 
plans have been set to create teams throughout the country by 2014, including Jacksonville and Orlando.
  It has garnered enough attention to make it 
into SportsCenter’s Top 10 plays, and is making the push to become a marketable sport, selling products ranging from player jerseys to auto-graphed discs.   The only thing left is for “Air Bud: Just Huck It” to hit the big screen.  This should not come as a surprise. Now 
played in more than 42 countries worldwide, nearly ﬁ  ve million Americans play ultimate each year, making it one of the fastest-growing sports in just over 40 years of existence.
  And despite all of its growth, ultimate has 
stuck to its roots. At most levels of the game, it revolves around a rule called “Spirit of the Game,” making it a self-ofﬁ  ciated sport.
  The best part, heckling is allowed — even in 
the pro league. Hell, it’s encouraged, as long as it doesn’t venture into taunting.
  So next time you see someone walking 
around campus with a disc, remember, they might be more than a stoner — maybe even a future pro athlete.
  Just like the football players.  Contact Corey McCall at cmccall@alligator.org
