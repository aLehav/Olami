The sun was setting on the horizon 
of the Caribbean. Sailboats were an-
chored next to the seashore, turning in after a long day. And a camera shutter snapped at orange-frosted clouds in the 
distance.
Ben Dunn, a UF College of Medicine 
professor, sees that image every time he 
turns on his desktop computer in his of-ﬁ  ce at UF Health Shands. That photo is one of many he took while on vacation in the Virgin Islands. Dunn is among a number of scien-
tists who have an artistic interest away from the lab. 
As educators in the science, tech-
nology, engineering and mathematics ﬁ  elds are teaching the next generation of innovators for jobs of the future, a caucus in Congress says one ﬁ  eld is be-ing overlooked: the arts.This caucus aims to change the acro-
nym from STEM to STEAM. It believes the arts are essential to innovation and should be included in the curriculum.
As of Wednesday, the caucus had 54 
members. People across the country are on board, including UF faculty. 
Looking at people who have been 
awarded Nobel Prizes, Dunn said, 
many of them have had either an arts 
endeavor or training in a musical in-strument.

� STUDENTS ARE AMBIVALENT ABOUT THE 
CHANGING WEATHER.

As students dig out their winter wear in celebra-
tion of cooler temperatures, UF meteorologist for 
WRUF Jeff Huffman advised the lower temperatures aren’t here to stay.
Huffman said the cooler-than-normal temperatures 
are expected to continue through early next week. A reinforcement of the cooler air is expected to settle in tonight, but a gradual warmup is expected later on. He said the weather pattern is on par with average.
“This is the time of year when it starts to get cool-
er. It’s about 10 degrees below average at night, and about ﬁ  ve degrees below average during the day, but that’s nowhere close to the record,” he said.
The temporary drop in temperature has some stu-
dents excited about fall.
Sarah Probst, a 19-year-old UF microbiology fresh-
man, said fall weather gives her new perspective. 
“I think it’s a great change of pace, and it gives the 
campus a new feel,” she said. “My ideal temperature is 52 degrees. I can wear different clothes and let my hair down.”
But Rebecca Vitkus, a 19-year-old UF English ju-
nior, disagreed.
“It’s a bit too cold for me,” she said. “I guess I just 
have to layer and invest in more scarves.”End-of-week 
cold front won’t stay for long

’90s kids, get ready — Bill Nye the Science Guy is coming to 
Gainesville. Accent Speaker’s Bureau paid the renowned edu-
cational television star $40,000 to speak at the Phillips Center for the Performing Arts on Nov. 21.
“Bill Nye is the perfect combination of knowledgeable, fun and inﬂ  uential,” said chairman Daniel Landesberg.
Doors will open at 7 p.m., and the show 
will begin at 8 p.m. The show is free and open to the public.
Jacob Ludin, a 22-year-old biology senior, 
said he is looking forward to the chance to 
see “a legend at work.”
“I’m so grateful that Accent brings in 
speakers like Bill Nye, who can educate the Student Body about the importance of science and how much fun it can re-ally be,” he said.
Tickets will be available at the Phillips Center for students at 
noon Nov. 20 and to the general public at 5 p.m. Nov 21.
Nye visited UF for an Accent event in 2007. According to 
Alligator archives, the 1,700 tickets were claimed, and 200 peo-ple watched from outside the Phillips Center.
When Accent brought scientist Neil de Grasse Tyson in the 
Spring, tickets were gone in 30 minutes of becoming available to students. There were no tickets for the public.Consider the following: Bill Nye the Science Guy to speak at UFLauren Troncoso / Alligator

Lillian Guerra, department of history, will discuss her book “Visions of Power in Cuba: 
Revolution, Redemption, and 
Resistance” on Monday at 3 p.m. in the Latin American Collection Reference Room, fourth floor of Smathers Library. In the tumultuous first decade of the Cuban Revolution, Fidel Castro and other leaders saturated the 
media with altruistic images 
of themselves in a campaign to win the hearts of Cuba’s six million citizens. In her book, Guerra argues that these visual representations explained rapidly occurring events and encouraged radi-cal change and mutual self-
sacrifice. Refreshments will 
be provided.

Hundreds of UF students on the pre-med-
ical school track are already preparing for 
the 2015 Medical College Admissions Test.
A Kaplan Test Prep survey released this 
week found 43 percent of medical school ad-
missions ofﬁ  cers believe the 2015 test will be 
much more difﬁ  cult, as the test is being re-vamped to include biochemistry, sociology and psychology sections and will last more than six hours.
The national survey of 79 admissions 
ofﬁ  cers reported 90 percent agree with the coming changes and 75 percent believe the test will further prepare students for medi-
cal school. 
The MCAT hasn’t been revised since 
1992.
Biology professor Marta Wayne said her 
department addressed the change in the test 
by creating a health disparities in society mi-nor.
She said she’s seen a growing focus on 
evidence-based medicine and translational 
research.
“The goal is to not weed people out but to change the people who are being selected,” 
Wayne said.
Although the anthropology senior plans 
to take a detour to medical school with a post-baccalaureate program in science, Me-gan De-Kok is already pursuing a health dis-parities in society minor.
“It’s a long test and you kind of only want 
to take it once, so that’s kind of nerve wrack-ing,” the 22-year-old said.Subjects being added to the MCATLOCAL

The books are organized, the ware-
house is quiet and volunteers are relax-
ing. But that won’t be the case Satur-day.
The semi-annual Friends of the Li-
brary book sale, 430-B N. Main St, kicks off at 9 a.m. when a bagpiper leads the charge inside.
The sale offers an estimated 600,000 
to 700,000 items — books, movies, art-work and more — to the public. It gives readers an opportunity to ﬁ  nd inexpen-sive books, Susan Park, president of Friends of the Library, said. Prices for 
most items range from 25 cents to $4.
“Maybe it’s not pristine,” she said. 
“But instead of paying $26 for a book, 
you might only pay $2.”
This year’s October sale received a 
large collection of books about India, she said.
The sale will be open until Wednes-
day, when all remaining items will cost 10 cents. 
Books are categorized on tables by 
subject matter or genre, such as ﬁ  ction, 
children’s books, religion and art.
Ann Hemme, a volunteer, said the 
organization doesn’t really keep track 
of how many attend the sale. They tried to count one year but stopped after 700 people.
Donations for the sale are accepted 
year-round, and volunteers are respon-sible for sorting and pricing categories.
When volunteers Sue Roland and 
Jean Kaufman talk about the sale, their eyes light up.
“Everybody’s looking for the ‘magic 
book’— the book they’ve been looking for,” Kaufman said. “It’s like Christ-mas.”Residents to book it to

Soulfest, the multicultural extravaganza, will take place at 4:30 p.m. Saturday at the Stephen C. O’Connell Center to celebrate “The Blueprints of Soul” with organization-al tabling, food and performances by Sabor Latino, Anomaly, the National Pan-Hellenic Council and the University Gospel Choir.
Lorena Silva, a 21-year-old UF anthropol-
ogy junior and the event’s assistant director of performance, said the number of perform-
ers has increased since last year from seven or 
eight performers to 14 this year.Because of the Reitz Union construction, 
the event will be hosted in the O’Connell Center for the ﬁ  rst time, Silva said.
“We can’t ﬁ  t 1,000 people in the grand 
ballroom,” she said.
Inter-Residence Hall Association presi-
dent Elliot Grasso, a 20-year-old UF ﬁ  nance junior, said this is the ﬁ  rst year IRHA is spon-soring a Homecoming event, Talent Night.
“As a student organization, we wanted to 
get more invested in Homecoming,” he said. “Our organization markets to over 8,000 stu-dents.”
Talent Night will take place at 7 p.m. Sun-
day at the Phillips Center for the Performing Arts and will host singers, dancers and a jug-
gler.
Stephanie Choate, a 20-year-old UF ad-
vertising junior and the director of the event,

Derrick Williams, a man who 
spent 18 years behind bars before 
being exonerated of a crime he did 
not commit, spoke at UF Hillel on 
Thursday. 
Williams, who was convicted of 
sexual battery in 1993, was released 
from prison on April 4, 2011.
In front of about 135 people, he 
said after being brought in front of a 
jury, he was sentenced to two natu-ral lifetimes in prison.
“I just fell down crying, asking, 
‘Lord, how can this be?’” he said. “I thought, ‘Wait a minute, you got the wrong man.’”
He said once the Florida Inno-
cence Project agreed to take up his case, his hope was restored. After being released, members of the proj-ect gave him clothes and gas cards 
while he searched for an honest dol-
lar.
Williams now works in aero-
space, making parts for aircraft.
“God has restored it all,” he said. 
“I got a beautiful wife and a beauti-ful truck.” 
Ezra Siegel, a 20-year-old politi-
cal science junior and programming 
intern at UF Hillel, said bringing 
Williams to campus was a part of the Center for Character Leadership and Service’s social impact week. 
Siegel said he learned of Wil-
liams’ story through the Innocence Project, a group he ﬁ  rst heard about 
in his judicial politics course.
“I think that wrongful imprison-
ment is a perfect example of social 
justice,” he said. 
He said with the U.S. holding 
the worldwide lead for incarcera-tion rates and overcrowded prisons, bringing Williams to speak to UF students would give them the in-
sight they need as voters if there are 
ever referendums on the country’s prison system.
Jackie Pugh, development coor-
dinator for nonproﬁ  t Florida’s Inno-cence Project, took the podium ﬁ  rst 
to explain the organization’s three-
pronged mission.
Pugh said its goal is to ﬁ  nd and 
free those wrongfully convicted, re-build their lives and work to correct 
the judicial system.
She said the Florida division, 
which was founded in 2003, primar-
ily uses DNA testing to exonerate its 
clients.
“We are the last hope for these 
people,” Pugh said.Exonerated man tells 
story at UF Hillel“We have so many different 
talents that people don’t even

� A DAY IN DIAGON 
ALLEY IS SCHEDULED FOR NOV. 7.
JENSEN WERLEY
Alligator Staff Writer 
jwerley@alligator.org
The butterbeer will be brew-
ing for Reitz Union Board En-
tertainment’s third annual Har-ry Potter-themed event, this 
year titled “A Day in Diagon 
Alley.”
The event, which will be 
hosted from 8 to 11 p.m. Nov. 7 
in the Reitz Union Grand Ball-
room, is free to the public and 
will feature the band Harry and 
the Potters.
Harry and the Potters are a 
tribute band known for start-
ing the wizard-rock genre and 
singing songs about events that 
happen in the series.
Tim Derrick, captain of 
the Quidditch team at UF and 
a 21-year-old classical stud-
ies senior, said he had been to 
previous Harry Potter-themed 
events, but adding in the band Harry and the Potters was a 
nice touch this year.
“There’s that whole wiz-
ard rock community,” he said, 
“and Harry and the Potters is one of the good ones.”
Event features include but-
terbeer, cupcakes, and wand and broomstick decoration, said David O’Leary, a 21-year-old UF business administration senior and RUB Entertainment co-director of special events.
“It’s our biggest event of 
the school year,” said Christina Chang, also co-director of spe-cial events for RUB. She said the group is expecting about 
1,200 people. 
The 23-year-old UF parks, 
recreation and tourism senior 
said seven of the most popular 
shops from Diagon Alley will be 
featured, including the Leaky 
Cauldron and Ollivanders. She said the event should cost RUB 
Entertainment about $8,000, ex-
cluding Harry and the Potters.
In the past, the event has had 
themes such as the Yule Ball 
and Hogsmeade, said O’Leary.
“I don’t know anyone who 
doesn’t like Harry Potter,” he said. “Even though they’ve 
stopped producing the origi-
nal seven, it’s still popular with students these days.”
Students who are fans of the 
series are looking forward to 
the annual event.
Other fans said this will be 
their ﬁ  rst event and plan to go 
because of the people who at-
tend.
“I’m a very avid fan of Har-
ry Potter and the franchise,” said Tatyana Mann, a 19-year-old UF art sophomore. “I like meeting new people who are 
just as avid.”
She said it makes her happy 
there are people like her who 
still feel so passionate about the series.
“The fact people are still 
going helps to keep the series alive,” she said. “It makes me feel like I’m not alone in sup-porting the series.”Harry and the Potters

Mindtree “partners with its cli-

them more competitive,” said Paul 
Gottsegen, the branch’s senior vice president.
During the event, a Mindtree 
executive led a group of clients through the third-ﬂ  oor ofﬁ  ce space in the Ayers Technology Plaza for a backstage tour to demonstrate the company’s inner workings.Visitors were shown entire 
walls used as whiteboards littered with colorful ideas written in dry-erase marker. Employees worked at computers while sitting on exer-cise balls, slowly bouncing up and down while they typed. Another group of employees “attended” a 
meeting via video chat with anoth-
er team in Texas. 
Most of the global company’s 
employees are located in India, Gottsegen said, but the company is 
taking strides to make a bigger im-
pact in the U.S.
It has already added more than 
100 jobs to the Gainesville commu-nity, according to a press release. Along with adding Fortune 500 companies to its clientele, Mindtree is expected to expand its business in Gainesville next year.

First, a DART to Grambling State University in Louisi-
ana. 
The Grambling Tigers staged a boycott of practices and 
games in protest of the bad conditions it faced both at home 
and during travel games, according to Deadspin. Although 
the boycott ended this week with school ofﬁ  cials agreeing to 
pay for upgrades to the team’s locker and weight rooms — which had damaged ﬂ  oors and ceilings, plus some nasty wa-
ter damage — the school is still attracting attention. 
The online editor of the Grambling student newspaper, 
The Gramblinite, was ﬁ  red from his position at the paper. He said he was ﬁ  red for tweeting statements from anonymous 
players and photos of the rundown football facilities. So much for freedom of the press. 
Our sympathies go out to the Tigers’ football players and 
newspaper staffers, and we’re forever thankful for our sprawl-ing football program and independent-newspaper status. 
On to happier news in our very own Alachua County: This 
week, Peaceful Paths, a network that provides aid for victims of domestic violence, announced it would open a High Risk 
Team in Alachua. 
The goal of the task force is to provide stronger support for 
victims of intimate-partner violence by working on a case-by-case basis. This week, we’re handing off a LAUREL to Peace-
ful Paths, which has been operating in the area since 1974.  
You guys may remember the infamous pepper-spraying 
cop of the viral video that appeared in 2011. The cop, a former 
University of California, Davis police ofﬁ  cer, was awarded more than $38,000 in worker’s compensation, the San Fran-
cisco Gate reported this week. 
If you don’t remember, the video is enough to make you 
sick. The cop, former police Lt. John Pike, let loose a stream of pepper spray on student activists — who were nonviolently 
protesting tuition hikes — while blocking their exit from the school’s quad.
Yeah. So it goes without saying: a DART to the State 
Division of Worker’s Compensation Appeals Board. Pike claimed psychiatric injury — a gross perversion of justice for 
the students who sustained both physical AND psychiatric 
injury from being, you know, pepper-sprayed in the face. 
On a happier note, we’re awarding a taking-girl-power-to-
the-next-level LAUREL to Paloma Noyola Bueno, a 12-year-
old girl from Matamoros, Mexico who stunned her teacher after answering a complex math problem — adding up every 
number between zero and 100 without a calculator — in min-
utes, when the task should have taken an hour. 
Paloma reportedly took an achievement exam and earned 
the highest math score in the country. Meanwhile, you still need your iPhone to calculate the proper tip on your tab at Gator City.

Our love/hate relationship with Pakistan
Shortly after the U.S. government shutdown ended, 
American ofﬁ  cials announced Pakistan will be receiving more than $1.5 billion in military and 
economic aid.
It is expected to repair a fractured relationship between 
the two countries. 
U.S. aid to Pakistan was suspended after the 2011 
Navy SEAL raid revealed to the world that Osama Bin Laden was hiding within the vicinity of a Pakistani 
military complex. 
However, animosity is by no means unique to 
American policymakers, as the Pakistani government 
has repeatedly called for an end to U.S. drone strikes in 
the country. 
The renewal of military and economic aid represents 
a pervasive problem in American foreign policy: The 
U.S. still pledges unconditional support to unfriendly and dubious regimes because of their nuclear power. 
Though some may argue the row between the 
two allies began with the killing of Bin Laden or the controversial drone strikes, the complicated relationship shared between the United States and Pakistan is deeply 
rooted in its nuclear arsenal. 
For instance, the Guardian conﬁ  rmed that during the 
1970s — when the Pakistani government ﬁ  rst embarked 
on its nuclear journey by enriching uranium — former President Jimmy Carter suspended all military aid to 
the country. 
Similarly, assistance plummeted in the 1990s as 
President George H.W. Bush responded to an increasingly 
stronger nuclear program. The reason the United States 
never completely severed ties with its South-Asian ally 
is because of its geostrategic importance. 
After the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, aid that 
was suspended by Carter was resumed in the mutual interest of defeating communism. 
The same Islamic fundamentalists who were used to combat the Soviets have supplanted the threat of Communism and thus, 
counterterrorism now accounts 
for the basis of the U.S.-Pakistani alliance. 
The Council on Foreign 
Relations reported the extensive number of radical groups 
operating in Pakistan falls within ﬁ  ve categories: Sectarian, anti-Indian, the Pakistani and Afghan Taliban and al-Qaida. 
However, Pakistan doesn’t seem too keen on 
eradicating the extremist militants lurking within its borders. 
Husain Haqqani, former Pakistani ambassador to 
the United States, wrote in an opinion article for The New York Times that “a whole generation of Pakistanis has grown up with textbooks that conﬂ  ate Pakistani nationalism with Islamist exclusivism.” 
The main reason Pakistan can receive aid while 
housing terrorists such as Bin Laden is because it has nuclear weapons.
And the government is quite aware of it. Nuclear weaponry is a key bargaining chip when 
negotiating with the U.S.
 It has allowed Pakistan’s prime minister to focus 
heavily on the drone campaign in his country, acting oblivious of the anti-American elements he hosts while still collecting money. 
With all of the economic problems the United States 
faces, it’s absurd the American government continues to dole out aid to those who harbor enemies. 
The U.S. should support democracy in Pakistan and 
withhold aid until such changes occur.

Zulkar Khan’s column on 
Accent Speaker’s Bureau corruption
I am grateful to be part of an 
institution where students ques-
tion apparent corruption and cro-nyism in organizations intended to represent them. 
As Mr. Khan may not be aware, 
there has been intrigue and dra-ma regarding Accent hosting Chomsky since mid-August. 
The policies of Accent impact 
the entire UF body, not just the students. 
Thank you, Mr. Khan, for 
speaking out for all of us. I hope 
that your article will cause posi-
tive changes to be made.
Heather Ray 
associate professor, UF physicsViews in Wednesday column not 
representative of IOC
In light of one of the opinion col-
umns that appeared in the Alligator 
on Wednesday, Islam on Campus would like to clarify its views on the article, “Accent is rife with corrup-
tion.” 
IOC encourages freedom of 
speech and taking an active part in 
leading social change, and while the author was an IOC member, his views are not necessarily represen-tative of the organization as a whole. Any and all information the writer presented was based on his own 
opinions, research and perspective.  
IOC, however, does not necessarily endorse the opinions mentioned in the article. 
IOC would further like to men-tion that it hopes to continue to build upon its strong relationship with Student Activities and Involve-ment over the course of this year 
and years to come and to build a 
stronger rapport with Accent as well. Thank you.
UF Islam on Campus
Wednesday columnist’s 
complaints unjustified
I’m not quite sure I understand 
the author’s beef with Accent 
Speaker’s Bureau.
Is it that Islam on Campus, an 
organization that he is a part of, 
chose not to sponsor the Chomsky 
speech? 
Is he upset that Accent chose not 
to sponsor the Chomsky speech, or is he upset that Accent advised the IOC not to sponsor the Chomsky speech?
Either way, it seemed like the 
rambling and disgruntled com-plaints of yet another college stu-dent that calls foul after things didn’t turn out the way he want-
ed. 
It is no secret that Accent Chair-
man Daniel Landesberg is a mem-
ber of the fraternity Alpha Epsilon Pi.  
While I don’t agree with “lega-
cy positions,” I blame the Student Body more than I blame the Uni-versity of Florida Greek system. 
First, people need to vote and 
vote consistently. 
The Greeks, regardless of the 
methods used, consistently get their members to vote in Student-Body elections and therefore are consistently represented in posi-tions of power in Student Govern-ment. 
Second, contrary to popular be-
lief, it is not hard to get involved in SG.
Accent, for example, required a 
simple application with some free-response questions. 
I was accepted, with no Greek 
afﬁ  liation or “connections” to SG. 
Boohoo, IOC didn’t sponsor 
Chomsky’s speech, but he still came and I’m sure the author of the article enjoyed it just the same. 
Let’s not cry over spilt milk.

Music has lost its revolutionary pow-
er, and it’s your fault.
Historically, music has proven 
to be a revolutionary societal force. From “La Marseillaise” of the French Revolution 
to “Masters of War” by Bob Dylan: Hymns, 
anthems, songs, albums and the like are creative tools with which people have done some of their most important work.
However, regardless of the inﬁ  nite range 
of music’s expressive power, the potential for music to be something more than a point of aesthetic reﬂ  ection can only be fulﬁ  lled if the music being produced has some cul-
tural signiﬁ  cance. Music, if it is to act as a 
revolutionary force, must reﬂ  ect the world in which we live.
Everyone is responsible for music’s di-
lapidated state in popular culture. Most responsible are musicians, like myself, who have failed to use their craft as a means of establishing a critical relationship with society. 
But consumers are to blame 
as well. One of the most preva-
lent themes in contemporary 
music is escapism. If you throw your hands in the air and wave them like you just don’t care enough, then perhaps you can forget about your troubles for the night, but that doesn’t mean they will go away. Notice one waves their hands in the air, not because one doesn’t care, but in an effort to act like one doesn’t care.
Those like myself, who take refuge in mu-
sic of the past, won’t escape this criticism. As powerful as the messages Bob Dylan, Sam Cooke and Neil Young carried were, they played music for their time, for their generation. Songs about civil rights and the horrors of Vietnam may contain timeless messages, but to rely on the music of the past for the im-petus to make societal change in the future is a distorted form of 
nostalgia.
Some of the most disturbing trends in 
popular music are happening within the 
electronic dance music scene. Music has been reduced to a means of facilitating sex, enhancing the experience of drug-use and bobbing your head. Needless to say, there’s nothing wrong with a good toe-tapper, but a good beat — and this is coming from a 
drummer — should not be the most relevant 
thing music has to offer.
Unfortunately, the world as we know it 
is in many ways a grim place. The scope of problems we face now is unprecedented.  Government spying programs, civil wars, anti-intellectualism, predator capitalism, and so on, plague our planet. These are the issues that ought to inspire our art.
The late American historian Howard 
Zinn wrote, “The artist needn’t apologize, 
because ... the artist is telling us what the 
world should be like, even if it isn’t that way now.”
Just like every other citizen, the artist has 
a civic responsibility to participate demo-cratically in society, especially through his or her art.
I by no means wish to condemn music as 
we know it. Every day I hear new artists that 
are pushing the boundaries and generating 
authentic art. But that is not to say things are getting better. Things are getting worse. Mu-sic continues to fail to fulﬁ  ll its potential as a revolutionary force, and it’s your fault.

Straining to take extra care with each 
stroke, he brushed the last coat of periwin-
kle paint onto the trim of Ms. Connie Wil-liams’ home on Saturday.
It was one of four houses in the Pleas-
ant Street neighborhood that Gerard Dun-
can said he started painting this month as 
a kickoff to his neighborhood revitalization initiative, “Occupy My Streetz.”Duncan has spent the last couple of 
years as a local pastor and volunteer. Now, he wants to use his work on Pleasant Street 
as a blueprint to innovate other neighbor-
hoods.
Duncan spends most days volunteering 
around the neighborhood or preaching to his congregation at Prayers By Faith Out-reach Fellowship Ministries, but he said this wasn’t always the case.
His eyes glass over a little as he remem-
bers a time before he was a pastor, before 
he married his wife and before he left 
Gainesville for a new life in Savannah, Ga., where he lived for seven years. 
With booze on his breath and one shaky 
finger on the trigger of a .38-caliber revolver pointed at his head, he recalls, he reached his lowest point.
“My idea of a good time came through 
drugs and through crime,” Duncan said. 
“And these are the things I grew up be-
ing.”
While in Savannah, he found something 
he was not looking for: a calling to preach.
When the time was right, he said he 
got a feeling that he needed to return to Gainesville.
“I had to come back,” he said. “I had to 
come back to the streets I helped destroy 
years ago.”
After he got Old Mount Carmel Baptist 
Church recognized as a historic landmark 
in September, he said people in the neigh-borhood finally started to believe in what he was trying to do.
By the beginning of January, Duncan 
said he plans to implement a program 
called “Innovative Dads.”
He said people are always eager to try 
to solve problems with welfare, drugs and 
poverty, but he thinks the root of these is-sues is fatherhood. The program will offer free group counseling sessions for fathers in the community.
For now, Duncan said he’s turned to 
the Community Redevelopment Agency to 
fund some of the revitalization efforts.
“The city buys the paint,” he said. “We 
pressure wash, and it’s done. You can’t get 
a better deal than that.”
Malcolm Kiner, a project coordinator for 
the redevelopment agency, said it started a “painting program” that offers community residents up to $500 in paint and supplies.
He said 10 residents have applied since 
Duncan launched his initiative to do the la-bor about a month ago.
Duncan said that the first house that he 
and some of his 20 volunteers painted was Bettye Cook’s.
Cook said she hasn’t been able to do 
anything to her property since she bought it in 1995.
On Saturday, she sat smiling on her 
front porch with about six family members under the freshly painted hot-pink trim.
“I’m just almost lost for words,” Cook 
said. “We’re proud of what we own again.”8, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, OCTOBER 25, 2013

When Dianne Farb was 47, she 
made herself a promise — to be-
come a published author by age 50.  
“I always wanted to write, but I 
never had the courage to,” she said. 
Now, the local attorney is 50, 
and she’s transitioning to produce 
her three print books to audio. “I have friends who only listen to 
audio (books),” Farb said. “I’m do-
ing this to broaden my audience.”
Her second romantic novel, 
“Rescuing Lacey,” will be her first to be converted to audio through Audiobook Creation Exchange, owned by Amazon.com. The audio version should be available through 
Amazon, Audible and iTunes by 
Christmas.
She writes under the pen name 
Rebecca Heflin, a version of her 
great-grandmother’s name, because 
it has “a more romantic ring to it.”  “The audio version is bringing 
the characters to life,” Farb said. She sees digital publishing as an open opportunity for authors be-
cause many publishers are hesitant 
to invest in authors who are not well-known. 
Farb won the Florida Writers 
Association Royal Palm Literary 
Award for “Rescuing Lacey” on 
Sunday. 
“It was like the Oscars,” she 
said. 
The novel has also won the Col-
orado Romance Writers Award of Excellence and the Award of Merit from the Virginia Romance Writers Holt Medallion competition. 
Jacksonville resident Susan Petty 
has stayed good friends with Farb since high school, which was “lon-ger ago than I’d like to admit,” she said, laughing. 
While reading Farb’s manu-
scripts, she said her high school friend’s writing is on par with that 
of a seasoned author. 
“They’re written with a sense 
of humor, and each one gets bet-
ter,” Petty said. “The stories get you right from the beginning.”
Farb said she tells her husband 
writing full time is her retirement plan. She hopes to publish a novel every year. 
“I hope she becomes a Nora 
Roberts one day,” Petty said.Local attorney releasing audio books of her romance novels

Enlightenment is coming to Gainesville.
Lama Tashi Topgyal, the Tibet-born teach-
er from a New York Buddhist center, is com-
ing to Gainesville to teach Buddhist history 
and lead meditations today through Sunday.
Topgyal and his translator, Lama Yeshe 
Gyamtso, will be conducting several sessions 
throughout the weekend.
The first session is at tonight at 7 at the 
United Church of Gainesville, 1624 NW Fifth 
Ave.  On Saturday, three sessions will be held at Atlantic Design Homes, 1502 Northwest 
Sixth Street, at 10 a.m., 2:30 p.m. and 7 p.m. 
On Sunday, sessions will occur at 10 a.m. and 2:30 p.m.
A historical session will be Saturday af-
ternoon, and an empowerment ceremony, which is considered sacred to Buddhist prac-titioners, will be Saturday evening.
“He is a wonderful teacher,” said Kath-
ryn Lehman, an event organizer. “The two of them together are a pretty dynamic duo.”
She said attendees of the Saturday eve-
ning service can expect a group meditation atmosphere in which Topgyal gives a special 
blessing.
Tom Vogler, a 62-year-old registered 
nurse at Community Hospice of Northeast 
Florida, plans to attend all of the events.
As an 18-year-old, Vogler was introduced 
to meditation by a friend who recommended books on the subject. He began regular medi-
tation and joined a Buddhist group at age 30.   
Although Vogler has helped host similar 
events in the past, he said he’ll be “attending 
as a student” for the weekend.

fied,” he said.Tibetan to teach Buddhist history

When the Pride Parade marches 
through Gainesville on Saturday, 
some city bus routes will be switched around.
RTS routes 5, 6 and 15 will detour 
away from University Avenue for about an hour between Southwest 10th Street and Southeast First Street.
The detour for all three routes will 
begin at 12:30 p.m., according to a news release.
Route 5 will detour its trip depart-
ing from the Oaks Mall by turning south off of University Avenue and onto Southwest 10th Street. From 
there, it will continue onto South-
west Second Avenue and proceed to Southeast Third Street, ending up at the Rose Parks Downtown Station.Route 15 will also detour its trip 
away from the mall by turning east from North Main Street onto North-east Second Avenue and arrive at Northeast Third Street, where it will continue to the downtown station.
The only detour for Route 6 will be 
its 12:40 p.m. trip from Plaza Verde at Northwest 23rd Avenue and North-west 13th Street. After turning east off Northwest Sixth Street and onto Northwest Eighth Avenue, it will go to North Main Street, continue on Northeast Second Avenue and turn south down Southeast Third Street to arrive at the downtown station.
RTS spokesman Chip Skinner said 
the detours should only last about an hour but could stretch to an hour and thirty minutes.  
“Depending on how quickly the 
parade moves, it hopefully won’t run over long,” he said. “We haven’t had issues in the past of it running over.”Bus routes detour for Pride

When Florida faces Georgia 
Tech on Saturday in a private 
scrimmage in Valdosta, Ga., guard Eli Carter could finally see some full-court action.
Coach Billy Donovan said 
Thursday that Carter, who has been limited in practice due to a broken leg he suffered while at Rutgers, would likely play against the Yellow Jackets. “We’d like to try and throw 
him in there and see what he can do,” Donovan said. 
“He has practiced some on 
and off. … The injury’s fully healed, but he still labors a bit. 
“I think it’s still in the back of 
his mind. But he’s doing better.”
Since returning to practice, 
Carter has been subbing in for spurts of about three or four pos-sessions during full-court drills. 
But due to the quick transi-
tion from an eight-month layoff, he has developed shin-splint is-
sues.
“The biggest thing, for us, is 
trying to get him to the point 
where he’s moving, cutting and sprinting in a way where he’s somewhat back to where he was,” Donovan said.
“He’s fully healed, so he’s 
not in harm’s way of re-injuring himself, but he needs to get more strength in his foot. He needs to get more strength in his calf. He needs to be more explosive.”Forward Will Yeguete, who 
suffered a knee injury during the offseason, has participated in practice recently in a limited capacity but will not play Satur-day. 
“I don’t think he feels he’s 
ready for that yet,” Donovan said.
After having only six players 
available in practice earlier this week, Donovan expects eight or nine to be available for the

Savannah Jordan has never stepped foot 
on Tennessee’s turf.
But after hearing of the Gators’ recent 
struggles on the road against the Volunteers, 
the freshman forward is anxious to compete.
“I’m excited to get there and play and see 
what Tennessee is like,” Jordan said. 
She and the rest of Florida travel to Knox-ville,  Tenn., to face Tennes-see today at Regal Soccer Stadium at 7 p.m.
Despite their lackluster 
record, the Volunteers are 5-1-2 when playing at home  
this season and have fared well as of late.
Tennessee beat Texas 
A&M, the Southeastern Conference leader, 1-0 on Sept. 20, and shut out Ole Miss on Oct. 4. Tennessee’s only home loss came in a 1-0 overtime defeat to South Carolina on Oct. 6. 
“They take a lot of pride playing at home 
— which all of us do, but I think they do a re-ally great job of that,” Burleigh said. 
“They’re an athletic, hard working team. 
They’re not going to give you anything easy.” 
The Volunteers (7-6-3, 2-4-2 SEC) stress 
that mentality, having beaten the Gators five Freshman looking to help UF change losing trend

Boo!
The next time you read the 
alligatorSports Brand Picks 
Column, it will be November!
Scary, right?
Since this is the last time we’ll be 
together this October, we would like 
to celebrate Halloween today.
How do you celebrate Hallow-
een?
We imagine that once you’ve fin-
ished trick or treating, bobbing for apples and watching “It’s the Great 
Pumpkin, Charlie Brown,” you like to settle down and watch the Flori-da-Georgia game.
But let’s not get ahead of our-
selves here. 
There will be plenty of time to 
talk about “The World’s Largest Outdoor Oh Yeah We’re Supposed 
to Stop Calling It That” in next 
week’s edition.
For now, we want to talk about 
Halloween costumes. What are you 
wearing this year?
We’ve come up with a few sug-
gestions for the Gators to maybe get 
them going:
1. Brent Pease — Si Robertson of 
“Duck Dynasty.”
Not only is Pease a fan of the 
A&E show, but Si scored a few touchdowns during his days as the Louisiana Tech quarterback ahead of Terry Bradshaw. Maybe the suc-
cess will carry over. I’m sure Brent 
would be willing to try anything with this offense right about now.
2. Florida’s offensive line — 
Ghosts
Because they are nowhere to be 
found! BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.
3. Every Gators defensive line-
man — Dominique Easley
Without Easley, the rushing de-
fense has fallen off. 
If you want to be as good as Ea-
sley, you can’t just carry around the 
Chucky doll. YOU’VE GOT TO BE Picks

Colin Thompson (@ColinThompsonUF)  
UF tight end, Pennsylvania native
Phillip: Adam, do you know why 
chickens live on farms? Because 
they wouldn’t survive in the zoo. 
Sure, the joke is corny, but the point is prescient — No. 5 Missouri will continue its improbable season and take care of business against No. 21 South Carolina 
on Saturday at home.
Although the 
Tigers’ sudden 
rise is unexpect-ed, it does not 
feel like a ﬂ  uke.
In the past 
two weeks, Mis-
souri has clob-
bered Florida 
and Georgia — two teams that expected to compete for a Southeastern Confer-ence crown this season — by an average of 17 points. 
Neither team had its full assortment 
of players, but I’m not sure it would have mattered against Mizzou, which joins Oregon as one of the only two teams 
to have won every game by at least 15 
points this season.
No James Franklin at quarterback? 
No problem. 
Replacement Maty Mauk torched 
Florida’s secondary for 295 yards last week. 
That type of performance is impres-
sive regardless of the opponent, but 
Mauk’s ability to slice-and-dice the na-
tion’s best secondary was eye-opening.
A year after being mocked for win-
ning just two games in its SEC debut, Missouri knows what the stakes of this 
game are and has additional motivation. 
Another win and the Tigers will have 
a stranglehold on the SEC Eastern Divi-
sion and can start making reservations to 
Atlanta.
They won’t miss out on this opportu-
nity to win a critical game in front of a raucous home crowd.
Adam: If that was the best joke you 
can think of, then maybe you should 
stick to reporting. 
How about this: What do you get 
when you cross a tiger with a snowman? Frostbite! Ha! Get it?
Well the Gamecocks are going to 
freeze the Tigers’ offense on Saturday. 
Remember, that was the nation’s best 
secondary with an ailing starting corner-back, Marcus Roberson, and with start-ing safety Cody Riggs ejected from the word ‘go.’
But if there’s another secondary that 
can keep up with Mauk and the Tiger crew, it’s South Carolina’s.
The Gamecocks have the No. 3 pass 
defense in the SEC, giving up fewer than 200 yards per game. 
And if anyone could intimidate a 
redshirt freshman quarterback making his second career start, it’s Jadeveon Clowney.
Although Clowney has not lived up 
to the Heisman Trophy hype from before the season, he still has a major presence on the defensive line. 
An average day for him is a tackle or 
two for a loss with maybe a sack thrown in.Clowney is going to make a Mauk-ery 
of the Mizzou O-line.
Phillip: Clowney is a great player, 
but I have always believed the hoopla surrounding him was a little overblown. 
If anyone deserves that type of atten-
tion, it is Missouri defensive lineman 
Michael Sam, who is doing everything 
we thought 
Clowney would do this season.
Through sev-
en games, Sam has nine sacks — that leads the conference by 
three — and 13 
tackles for a loss. 
I’m pretty sure Tyler Murphy is going 
to have nightmares about this guy for 
weeks after Sam pillaged Florida’s of-
fensive line for three sacks Saturday. 
With Sam wreaking havoc against op-
posing offenses, Missouri is fourth in the 
SEC in scoring defense, allowing an av-
erage of 22.1 points per game, and ﬁ  rst 
in sacks.
If there is one thing we know about 
South Carolina — other than Clowney being overrated — it is Connor Shaw is 
likely to get injured.
Wait, what? Shaw is already hurt! He 
isn’t even playing. 
Good luck with Dylan Thompson, 
who has as many interceptions as touch-
downs this season, leading a Gamecocks offense that was already only a middle-of-the-pack unit.
But South Carolina will lean on run-
ning back Mike Davis you say. Well, Missouri is 19th in the nation in rushing defense. It could be a long day for the Gamecocks. 
Adam: Missouri may be 19th in the 
nation in rush defense, but exactly who have they faced?
A punchless Georgia team stumbling 
along, missing Todd Gurley and Keith Marshall? A Florida run attack that even Will Muschamp said didn’t give its best running back enough carries?
With Shaw out, South Carolina is go-
ing to lean on Mike Davis, and he will deliver.
Davis is just a sophomore and he is 
already one of the best running backs in the nation.
He is 10th in the nation in rushing 
yards per game and has already scored 10 touchdowns on the ground.
He’s the type of game-changing half-
backs Mizzou just has not seen.
No, Thompson has not been spectacu-
lar, but the junior is talented.
You said he has thrown as many 
touchdowns (2) as he has interceptions (also 2), but last year he tossed 10 touch-down passes while only throwing two picks.
It’s not like USC is going to play some 
walk-on scrub. The kid is a player.
It may be homecoming for the Tigers, 
but the Gamecocks are going to make Faurot Field nice and cozy. 
South Carolina is already used to 
playing in Columbia (S.C.) and will get back into the SEC East race with a win.RJ SCHAFFER
Alligator Writer @rjschaffer
Despite sweeping nine consecutive 
opponents earlier this season, the Gators 
are still battling to win the program’s 20th Southeastern Conference title.
Following a four-set loss to undefeat-
ed No. 11 Missouri last weekend, No. 5 Florida has 10 matches remaining and 
may need to win all of them to clinch the 
regular season crown.
“It was a tough weekend, but it wasn’t 
anything that we couldn’t handle,” red-shirt sophomore middle blocker Simone 
Antwi said.  
“We’re all going to back bounce from 
it. So, it was a great learning experience 
for the team.” 
Since coach Mary Wise joined the pro-
gram in 1991, the Gators have dominated the conference. 
The only program that has won the 
SEC besides Florida — regular season or tournament title — is Tennessee, which 
won the SEC tournament in 2004 and the 
regular season title in 2011. 
Florida’s 19 regular season titles are 
the most in the conference’s history. 
The next highest total is LSU with six. 
UF has been held without a regular sea-son or tournament title just twice since 
1991. But the additions of Texas A&M and 
Missouri stiffen the competition.
The Tigers have 10 NCAA Tourna-
ment appearances in their history, all of 
which have come since 2000. 
They were absent from the tournament 
in 2008, 2009 and 2012. 
Texas A&M has enjoyed similar suc-
cess, missing the tournament just four times since 1993. 
The Aggies have four trips to the Sweet 
16 and two to the Elite Eight in that time. 
Despite the 
loss to Missouri, Florida is still the 
team to beat in 
the conference.
“Good teams suffer losses,” Antwi 
said. 
“I think it is part of the growing expe-
rience for a team.”  
Florida can win the SEC while aveng-
ing its loss to Missouri when the Tigers 
come to Gainesville on Nov. 15.
If the Gators sweep the match, they 
will win the conference outright — un-less Missouri or Florida lose another SEC 
match.
If the match is won by Florida in four 
sets, it will come down to the points 
scored in the sets of both matches played 
between Missouri and Florida. 14, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, OCTOBER 25, 2013

Florida has not come away with a 
win at Tennessee since 1999.
“We’ve had our struggles at Ten-
nessee, so it’s going to be up to us 
to really step up and play a good 
game,” Burleigh said. “We know they’re a tough team to play at home, and their record reflects that this year too.” 
Tennessee — 11th in the SEC en-
tering the weekend — needs a win to stay in contention for the SEC Tournament, which only the top 10 
teams in the conference are eligible 
to compete in.
Burleigh said the Gators (12-3-1, 
6-2 SEC) need to stick to their style of play and focus on one-two-touch soccer to extend the momentum coming off of a successful weekend, which included back-to-back 3-0 shutouts. 
“We’re starting to see what loyal-
ty or trust or things like that look like on the field,” Burleigh said. “That’s a pretty big motivator when you’re playing for your teammates and playing in a style of play that you like to play and are comfortable in.”
Florida’s final game of the week-
end brings league-leader Texas A&M 
(12-3-1, 7-1 SEC) to James G. Pressly 
Stadium at 3 p.m. on Sunday
“A&M is really talented,” Bur-
leigh said. “I think they’re somebody who has a strong identity of what they’re trying to do, and they do it very successfully.” 
Added Jordan: “If we can come 
out with the same performance that 
we did this weekend, then we can be 
successful.”THE CHUCKY DOLL.

This week, we’ve got two guys — Joe 
Morgan and Phillip Heilman — attempt-ing to masquerade as good pickers in a showdown centered on the Texas A&M-Vanderbilt matchup in College Station.
Remember, guys, no matter how many 
times you knock, everybody gets the same candy.
Except for Charlie Brown. He gets a 
rock.
The Aggies (-18) will send the Com-
modores away with toothbrushes and those nasty orange marshmallow peanuts because...
Johnny Freaking Football, that’s why! 
Did you see the photos of those girls he was with while dressed up as Scooby Doo 
on Halloween night last year? I’m willing 
to wager nobody has ever scored on Hal-loween more than Manziel did that night. Also, it’s Vanderbilt. C’mon, man.
- Joe Morgan
The Commodores (+18) will arrive at 
Texas A&M with all tricks and no treats because...
Vanderbilt is actually dressing up like a football team this October. Too bad James Franklin will probably want to try a cos-tume different than his Commodores polo next year. But, for now, it’s sort of fun to be a Vandy fan. Or so I would imagine.
- Phillip Heilman
Now onto the picks (and costume sugges-
tions for our pickers)!
Maintaining his lead  at 37-24-3 is alliga-
torSports Editor Phillip “Pendulum” Heil-man, whose mood swings in the office are 
the stuff of legend. Remember when the 
season was over for the Red Sox just last week, buddy? Other baseball fans would like you to shut up. Thanks.
Tied for first is alligatorSports Staff 
Writer Joe “Mark Brunell” Morgan, who has had a rough go of it since the NFL season started. You deserve to relive the 
glory day. You read it. Day. Try to make it 
through the day without sobbing, OK?
Next up at 34-27-3 is alligatorSports 
Assistant Editor Adam “Toby Flender-son” Lichtenstein, who, like The Office actor Paul Lieberstein, is the worst person in our office. Adam, why are you the way that you are? We hate so much about the 
things that you choose to be.
Leading the non-alligatorSports guys 
at 33-28-3 is Cody “Braves manager Fredi Gonzalez” Jones, who should maybe try to 
walk one day in the skipper’s spikes before criticizing the poor fellow. Nah, we don’t know what we’re talking about. Take Fre-diot to task, Cody!
Last among the alligatorSports guys but 
still in the hunt at 32-29-3 is alligatorSports 
Staff Writer Adam “Ryan Lochte” Pincus, 
who wouldn’t have to do much to pull off this costume. Just learn how to swim and shave your legs, bud. Jeah.
Tied with Pincus at 32-29-3 is the Orlan-
do Sentinel’s Edgar “Rick Scott” Thomp-son, who shares a pretty scary likeness to Skeletor — uh, we mean our esteemed 
governor. Whether Edgar is as universally 
disliked, we won’t say.Capping the three-way tie at 32-29-3 is 
247Sports.com’s Thomas “Chad Michael Murray” Goldkamp, who bears a strik-ing resemblance to the tween heartthrob. Be careful trick or treating, Thomas. Once 
those 12-year-old girls get a look at you, 
they’ll forget all about the candy corn and Snickers bars.
And in dead-ass last with a piss-poor 
record of 29-32-3 is InsideTheGators.com’s Bryan “Dusty Rhodes” Holt, who has fall-en on some “Hard times, deddy!” both in the alligatorSports Brand Picks Column 
and as a Buccaneers fan. Maybe you’ll fi-
nally get some creamsicle on Halloween, bud!

scrimmage.
Several others continue to 
battle injuries. 
Forward Casey Prather 
has missed the past three 
practices with a hamstring in-jury, while guard Dillon Gra-ham (ankle) will likely return to practice Monday. 
Dorian Finney-Smith is 
day-to-day with a strained tendon in his ankle. Donovan said the redshirt sophomore forward suffered the injury Wednesday in practice when landing awkwardly after try-ing to chase down a player from behind. 
“I don’t think it’s anything 
too serious,” Donovan said.
Center Damontre Harris 
(hamstring) returned to prac-tice earlier this week after missing about a week of full-contact drills.  
Since the shorthanded 
Gators have often relied on 4-on-4 sets during practice, they are excited to compete in a rotation against players not on their roster Saturday. 
“It’s going to feel pretty 
good to go and beat up on somebody else other than ourselves,” center Patric Young said. 
Added guard Michael Fra-zier II: “Georgia Tech is sup-posed to be a good team, so 
it should be a good measure-
ment for us.”
Frazier healthy after scare:  
The idea of possibly contract-ing mononucleosis had Fra-
zier frightened.
But after tests came back 
negative last week, Frazier, 
who battled virus-like symp-
toms for a couple of days, 
was relieved.
“It was scary,” Frazier 
said. “I was praying that 
I didn’t have it. Luckily, I 
didn’t have it.”
When he was sick, Frazier 
had body aches, headaches and a sore throat.
“I was in bed for most of 
the day,” he said.
Frazier returned to prac-
tice Oct. 17 and is now feeling 
100 percent. 
The guard’s current goal 
is getting back into game 
shape. 
Since the summer, Frazier 
has dropped 10 pounds. His 
weight is now 198 pounds. 
Frazier added that his 
body-fat percentage has 
dropped by about 3 percent from last year.
“I’m lighter, jumping 
higher, quicker, faster,” he 
said. “It’s definitely helping 
on the court.”Frazier feeling betterUF has not won at UT since 1999

The best defense is a good offense. 
The Gators are banking on that mantra 
to ring true this season.
Florida ranked third in the Southeast-
ern Conference in scoring offense with 70.6 points per game last season, trailing only Tennessee and Kentucky. 
The Volunteers and the Wildcats ﬁ  n-
ished fourth and eighth, respectively, in the nation. 
But the Gators lost two of their top three 
scorers from last season. 
Sydney Moss, who transferred to Thom-
as More College during the offseason, was second on the team with 11.8 points per game a year ago. 
Jennifer George averaged 11 points per 
game as Florida’s only senior after leading 
the team in scoring with 12.8 points per 
game during her junior season in 2011-12. 
“Jennifer is not a player you can replace 
too easily,” redshirt sophomore guard 
Cassie Peoples said. 
“We’re going to have to ﬁ  nd our own, 
new identity for this team and for this pro-gram this year.”
Last season’s leading scorer, Jaterra 
Bonds, returns for her senior season, but the rebounding presence provided by Moss 
and George will be missed. 
The departed duo led the team in offen-
sive rebounds on a Florida squad ranked 
fourth in the conference in the category.
“I never think you can ﬁ  ll anybody’s 
shoes,” Bonds said. “You can create your own, new path.”
With two huge parts of last year’s of-
fense gone, coach Amanda Butler has had to make signiﬁ  cant changes. 
It’s ﬁ  tting that the Gators are moving to 
a system emphasizing the transition game.
The consensus among coaches and play-
ers is this team’s strength is in its quickness and versatility. “I think we’ve got great team speed,” 
Butler said. 
“I think we’re going to have great bal-
ance. I think we’re going to have a lot of 
versatility and a lot of ability to interchange 
positionally. 
“That should make us hard to guard 
and, in some instances, pose some defen-sive problems.”
Added sophomore guard January Mill-
er: “Our strength is our running ability. We 
love to get up and down. We’re very quick. Our dribble penetration and our shooting … we play off of that really well and we’re going to incorporate that in a lot of plays that we run.” 
Florida ranked third in the SEC in ﬁ  eld 
with a .432 ﬁ  eld goal percentage in 2012.
With the offensive-minded Bonds back 
in the fold, as well as the additions of fresh-man Ronni Williams and transfers Antoi-nette Bannister and Peoples, that number could improve this season.
“A strength of this team is our ability to 
interchange,” Butler said. 
“We’ve got post players that have got 
great face-the-basket skills. Just about ev-erybody on the team has legitimate 3-point range.”
The players said they know they are 
strong in the shooting game, too. 
“We’re all shooters,” sophomore for-
ward Christin Mercer said. 
“Last year, [Bonds] was our point guard. 
She played almost 40 minutes a game. We saw some problems later in the postseason 
in that she got cramps. 
“Cassie Peoples will take over some of 
[Bonds’] role. She’s great with her handles. 
We just added another shooter to the fam-
ily.”
This family of shooters is young, with 
three sophomores, three redshirt sopho-
mores and one freshman on a team of 10 — nine given Viktorija Dimaite is out for the season. 
Although the team may seem young and inexperienced on paper, Butler believes her 
group has enough experience at the college 
level.
“We’re kind of an old, young team,” she 
said. “We have this giant sophomore class. 
Most of those sophomores have been in col-
lege for more than two years, although they may not have two years of playing experi-ence underneath their belt. 
“We don’t think of ourselves as a young 
team, although it may look that way on pa-
per.”

“I think we’ve got great team

That should make us hard to guard
