SPORTS 14CLEVELAND (AP) — Fashion design-
er Diane von Furstenberg has helped the 
Cleveland Clinic create a more stylish hos-pital gown without the peek-a-boo back.
The gown features elements associated 
with von Furstenberg designs — a wrap dress with a bold, graphic print. The clin-ic’s logo is printed on the fabric.
The gown has side ties, which elimi-
nate the embarrassing open-back look.
The Plain Dealer says the fabric was chosen to address a concern that patients were too warm in the hospital.
So designers had to find a material 
lightweight enough to be cool but tough enough to withstand frequent laundering and having monitors and drains pinned to it.
Feedback has been mostly positive. 
Some men have complained that the gown is too feminine, so the design team is con-dering an alternate print.Designer Diane von Furstenberg creates Ohio hospital gowns

� HE WAS TEACHING IN SOUTH AFRICA

On June 10, Thomas Maresco blogged about his 
excitement for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, 
where he would root for the USA while serving as 
a Peace Corps volunteer.
On Aug. 5, he wrote about “the blood, sweat 
and tears” it took for him to obtain a pig to roast for July 4.
On Aug. 17, Maresco blogged for 
the last time on how surreal it felt to eat lunch “less than three feet” away from South African President Jacob 
Zuma. 
On Friday, Maresco, a 24-year-old UF grad, died 
from a gunshot wound in Lesotho, a small country 
landlocked by South Africa. 
He was serving as a secondary science teacher 
in Katse, a village in Lesotho.
According to a CNN report released Sunday , 
Lesotho Police Inspector Lekhotla Mojete said Friends of 
alum reflect on kindness, hard work
 Here are some of the recommendations 
proposed in the report by Margolis, Healy 
and Associates:
- The Behavioral Consultation Team 
should be allowed to act more autono-
mously and without having to consult 
personnel outside of the BCT when in-vestigating, evaluating and managing cases.- All BCT members should receive the same basic and advanced behavioral threat assessment training, including training for new team members and ad-ditional personnel consulted on more se-
rious cases.
- The BCT should also handle threats and troubling behavior from faculty and staff, in addition to students.- UPD should consider a policy statement addressing the department’s use of force when dealing with the mentally ill.

Changes might be in store for UF’s ap-
proach toward handling campus threats, 
including increased attention to threaten-
ing or troubling behavior from faculty and staff members.
The consulting firm hired to evaluate 
UF’s mental health and police policies in 
the wake of the March shooting of a doc-
toral student by university police released its report Tuesday.
The Richmond, Vt.-based firm, Margo-
lis, Healy and Associates, have spent about six months researching and preparing the report.
The report includes a set of 19 recom-
mendations that mostly addresses the uni-versity’s Behavioral Consultation Team.
The BCT is a collaboration between UF 
officials, such as the Dean of Students and members of the Counseling and 
Wellness Center, as well 
as members of the Univer -
sity Police Department to 
address the assessment of, and intervention with, 
students in distress.
UF President Bernie Machen said in a 
press conference Tuesday afternoon he wants to seek input from the entire univer -
sity community about the recommenda-
tions. 
“I believe we have found in the past that 
an open dialogue is helpful,” he said.
Some of the recommendations include 
requiring involuntary counseling for stu-dents of concern, hiring a full-time case 
manager to ensure threat-management 
plans are handled appropriately and the creation of a UPD policy statement about the use of force with the mentally ill.
Machen said the university is going to 
seriously consider all of the recommenda-tions, and after time and input from the Shooting review report released

96-year-old woman dies of injuries from July attack
Lila Leach, a 96-year-old New-
berry resident who was brutally 
attacked in her home on July 16, died early Monday.
Investigators are waiting on 
autopsy results to determine the exact cause of death. 
If it is determined to be a direct 
result of the assault, the attacker could face murder charges, ac-cording to Art Forgey , spokesman for the Alachua County Sheriff’s 
Office.
The ASO is examining suspects 
and following  current leads. 
“It is by no means a cold case,” 
Forgey said.
Leach sustained injuries over 
her entire body.
“The first deputy that arrived 
on scene was not sure if it was 
male or female,” he said.
Leach had been hospitalized 
at Shands at UF since the attack. Before she died she was able to briefly communicate with fam-ily members, and detectives were able to interview her, according to Forgey.
Forgey was unable to disclose 
whether any items had been taken from her home during the attack, 
but he said the attacker could have 
taken whatever they wanted with-out harming her.

Student Government party 
leaders were impressed with 
the turnout for slating Tuesday, 
which marked the final day of in-terviews for those hoping to run for SG positions.
“We wish we could slate them 
all,” said Micah Lewis, Unite Par -
ty spokesman.
According to Supervisor of 
Elections Amanda Griffin, a to-tal of 420 people qualified to run 
for Student Senate seats over the past three days. 
Yevgen Sautin, communica-
tions director for 
the Student Alliance party, said students 
who slated with the  
Student Alliance Party, of whom 
many were freshmen and sopho-mores, bought into the party’s 
message.
“The message that SG is bro-
ken very much resonates with 
them,” he said.
Progress Party leader Dave 
Schneider said that even though the turnout for his party might have been lower than expected, 
he is still satisfied with the qual-
ity of students who came out for the slating.
“This is the ticket that I want-
ed,” he said.

Sept. 28 and 29.SG hopefuls finish interviews for upcoming election

will be developed to move forward.
“I will use the report as a frame-
work for the action plan,” he said.
He said the process could take a 
while, depending on the amount of in-terest and conversation resulting from 
the report.
“We’ll try to move it as expeditious-
ly as we can,” he said.
 Kofi Adu-Brempong,  a geography 
doctoral student and instructor of an introductory geography course, had 
been suffering from mental problems before the night of March 2, when of-ficers responded  to a report of scream-
ing coming from his Corry Village apartment.
According  to police reports,  an of-
ficer shot Adu-Brempong  in the face 
and hand after he approached  officers 
with a metal rod.
Maresco was observed leaving a function at a hotel in the capital city of Maseru when a stranger shot him Fri-day. 
His family is still trying to obtain his body . “Tom embodied what being a Peace Corps volun-
teer is all about,” Amy Panikowski,  a UF Peace Corps 
recruiter, wrote in an e-mail. “He was a kind and enthu-siastic individual who genuinely wanted to make a dif-
ference in the world. Our UF Peace Corps community  is 
devastated by the loss of Tom, but we are comforted by 
the fact that we know Tom didn’t want to be anywhere else but in Lesotho.”
Originally from Port St. Lucie, Maresco graduated 
from UF in 2008 with a bachelor’s  degree in biology and 
a minor in classical studies. 
In November  2009, he arrived in Lesotho and began 
his Peace Corps service, which was to end in January 
2012.  
Besides teaching  science to children,  he also played 
guitar for them and coached them in a number of sports. 
In one of his blog posts, he described his basketball 
hoop-making project and posted pictures. 
“A lot of planning,  designing  and hard work has 
gone into them (the hoops) so I hope you enjoy them as 
much as the students will,” Maresco wrote. 
“He was a really unique individual and had a lot of 
different  interests,”  said Brett Owens, president  of Sig-
ma Chi fraternity , to which Maresco belonged to while he was a student. “He made the most out of life every single day and he was also concerned with where the 
world was going.” 
Sigma Chi is planning to raise money to donate to 
the Peace Corps on behalf of Maresco, since members 
feel that is what he would have wanted to do.  They will hold a memorial service the weekend of Sept. 25.4, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 8, 2010

parties will arise with the approach  of the Sept. 28 and

2011-2012  Activity  and Service Fee Budget of about $16.7 
million at their meeting Tuesday night.
The budget allocates  about $4.9 million to Student 
Government,  including  $407,100  to Accent,  which spon-
sors free speaking  events on campus,  and $672,500  to Stu-dent Government   Productions,  which brings entertainers 
and music artists to UF.
After the budget passed, talk turned to the Dove World Outreach Center’s plans to burn copies of the Islamic holy 
book, the Quran, on Sept. 11.
Independent Sen. Cassia Laham encouraged senators 
to protest the Dove World Outreach Center’s actions, 
noting that Gen. David Petraeus,  the commander  of U.S. 
forces in Afghanistan,  claimed  the Quran burning  would 
endanger  American troops.

The sheriff and the county commission are 
heading for a showdown.
After the county commission  voted to move 
forward with a budget that will require the 
Alachua  County Sheriff’s  Office to trim rough-
ly $500,000  from its budget Tuesday,  Sheriff 
Sadie Darnell is preparing to appeal the vote 
to the governor and the cabinet. 
“I believe when I make my appeal to the 
governor and the cabinet, they will see that 
this county commission is not funding basic 
services first,” she said.
The vote was 3-1 with Alach-
ua County Commissioner Lee Pinko-
son casting the dissenting vote.  
Darnell  submitted  the ACSO’s  original  bud-
get in May and said she originally made $1.1 million in cuts and was 
within her allotted budget. 
With the county asking her to 
cut another  $500,000  from the budget,  Darnell 
believes the ACSO has reached its breaking 
point.
“I’m down to bare bones,” she said. Commission Chairwoman Cynthia Moore 
Chestnut said she believes it is possible for Darnell to make the necessary cuts. 
“It’s a matter of priorities,”  she said. “As 38 
percent of the budget, $65 million, we believe 
she can find $500,000.”
Chestnut said she would be glad to sit down 
with the sheriff and go line by line through the budget to identify areas that can possibly be cut. 
But Darnell  said she just doesn’t  believe 
it’s possible and that the county commission doesn’t have their priorities in order.
“They’re basically saying ‘Too bad, we’ve 
got our programs that we believe are more im-portant than public safety,’” she said. 
Now she’s preparing to take it all the way 
to Tallahassee,  and she’s confident  that the 
governor will side with her.Sheriff plans

The browning, wilting leaves 
on the tree branches in the McCa-
rty Hall courtyard foreshadow the end for the biggest avocado tree on campus.
But it also presents the begin-
ning of a much bigger concern for UF forestry experts.
The tree is suffering from Lau-
rel Wilt Disease, which has swept across the southeast United States in the past decade, terrorizing avo-cado and other trees susceptible to the disease. 
“Avocados are at real risk of be-
ing wiped out,” said Jason Smith, an assistant professor of forest pa-thology. “It’s a real big concern.”
The disease, which is caused by 
beetles cultivating fungus inside the tree, can kill a tree in as little as a week.
Smith said that, though the dis-
ease is lethal to the trees, it is not a human health concern. 
In other words, fruit from a tree 
with Laurel Wilt would be fine to eat.
Nothing can be 
done to save the dy-ing avocado tree by McCarty Hall, but 
Smith and several UF graduate students are working to find ways to prevent other trees from being infected. 
Friday morning, UF gradu-
ate student Don Spence injected a campus Redbay tree with fungi-cides to protect it. 
He hooked up tubes to the tree, 
which put the fungicide inside. 
“It’s essentially an IV system 
for the tree,” Smith said.
However, the tree treatment 
doesn’t come cheap. The cost is around $100, Smith said, but hope-
fully it will protect the tree for 
about three years. 
The focus is currently on pre-
ventive measures in the short-term, 
Smith said. For the long-term, 
Smith and Spence are researching 
what makes certain trees survive 
Laurel Wilt. 
The beetle that spreads the dis-
ease reproduces quickly and can-
not be eradicated, Smith said. 
The disease also spreads as 
infected trees are cut down and 
moved from place to place for things such as firewood. However, 
Smith says, it will take time for UF 
to find the proper defense. 
For now, that is all that can be 
done.Disease

EDITORPaul RunnestrandStefania FerroMANAGING EDITORSJared MisnerOPINIONS EDITORFrat recruitment breaks stereotypes
I participated in the Interfraternity Council’s fall 2010 re-
cruitment this past week. Now, as much as I’d love to say I entered into the process like Hunter S. Thompson 
did in “Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail ‘72,” — a journalist looking for the scoop on a mystical and oft-mis-interpreted process — that wasn’t the case. I was genuinely interested in finding a fraternity that would suit my needs.
Is that cliché? Perhaps. I’m not a typical “frat boy” by 
any means — well, I do like Sperrys and I do wear collared shirts more often than not, but the image of fraternity life at UF and frankly, at colleges and universities across the 
English-speaking world have been a bit skewed.
Now, who’s to blame for that? Partial blame goes to “Na-
tional Lampoon’s Animal House,” which, for nearly four 
decades, has made parents, prospective students and con-cerned adults worldwide think every gentleman who joins 
a fraternity is a carbon copy of Bluto. 
But to be fair, part of the blame goes to the fraternities as 
well. As I participated in recruitment, I heard stories from 
multiple houses I visited about “returning to campus.” Granted, the current brothers had nothing to do with this — but irresponsible and reckless fraternity brothers tarnished the name of their fraternity, their fraternity’s reputation on the UF campus, and the idea of fraternity life worldwide.
I could not have asked for a better recruitment process. 
I’m below-average height for a college guy and above-av-erage weight (let’s not even mention BMI), so I felt I was going to be a sitting duck at what I presumed to be one of the most subjective processes since I applied at Hollister. How wrong was I. 
I visited four houses in total  after planning on visiting 
six, but I was able to tell just from the environment and at-mosphere of two of the houses that they weren’t for me. I could tell they cared more about appearance than potential, and that wasn’t the group of guys I wanted to associate myself with.
One of the most appealing things 
about fraternity life at UF is the in-
herent diversity that comes with each 
group of guys. Some sported the typi-cal “frat star” look — the long Oxford shirts, khaki Dockers shorts, a brown belt and Sperrys. 
Others were less concerned with their members’ appear -
ance, but cared more about the appearance of their houses — whether there was a cannon, a lion or gigantic lettering out front.
Members of the UF Greek office encouraged potential 
brothers that there was a fraternity for each of them. 
That’s not so true. Fraternity life, be it with the IFC or 
Multicultural or National Pan-Hellenic, is not a universally accepted lifestyle. Each frat has its own quirks, but there are some universal truths. 
Fraternity life is not all about alcohol, but if you are 
heavily against imbibing in certain substances, Greek life cannot only be intimidating, it could be downright frighten-ing. Recruitment is a “dry” procedure, but to presume the process afterward would remain dry requires astronomical naïveté.
So, after a long week, I narrowed it down to two houses, 
and decided to pledge for one of them.  In the long run, I believe fraternity life will be a net gain. I can’t bench more than 150, and I’m just an average athlete, but the network-ing opportunities and brotherhood Greek life provides ex-ceeds its otherwise steep price tag.
I’m pretty sure I made the right choice. I hope.Sean Quinn is a first-year political science student. His

change but adding that the report will likely recom-mend changes presents the same challenges the Stu-dent Body faced prior to one of our own being shot in the face: bureaucratic gobbledygook. 
Having already fired 
the commanding officer in the shooting of Kofi  Adu-Brempong, a decision widely labeled as a scape-goat and appeasement, and announcing a plan to cre-ate an independent review board, we are left wonder -
ing what substantial chang-es will actually be enforced after an apparent creation of a review board. 
Although we agree UPD 
needs an independent re-view board, we are hesitant to believe it will be called upon to review every major 
decision the UPD is forced 
to make.  
Time doesn’t allow for 
review in some circum-stances, like when disabled students are shot in the face. 
If anything, following 
the release of the indepen-
dent report, which we can 
only hope will be sometime soon (we’ve been waiting six months), we hope the UPD learns to think first and shoot later. Human wrongs
UN report misrepresents 
America’s struggle for 
human rights
We’ve come an awfully long way since Geneva. 
No, we didn’t believe that either. After being submitted last month, a report in 
which the U.N. Human Rights Council analyzes human rights records of every country in the world is being praised by many 
and scrutinized by even more. 
Described as “largely upbeat,” the nonbonding, indepen-
dent (read: It means absolutely nothing) report praises the U.S. 
for its almost uniform opposition to waterboarding, its pledge to close Guantanamo Bay and its health care overhaul leading to health care coverage for millions of poor Americans.
And we’re with you there, U.N. Although you might want 
to try to convince John McCain to vote for a waterboarding ban one of these days.  But to euphemize the U.S.’s current climate 
as “largely upbeat” is a misrepresentation and a slap in the face 
to many who live in this nation of exclusion and inequalities where every man (and woman) is clearly not created equal.
Shall we return to the Abu Ghraib torture and prison abuse 
scandal? Geneva’s still over there crying like a little girl at how embarrassing that is for us.  But we’re largely upbeat.
Leave it to the hipsters at American Apparel for bringing to 
light many of the human rights violations with shirts and ac-companying messages such as “Legalize Gay” and “Legalize 
Arizona.” When we profile Hispanics with hopes of sending 
more people packing back south (although Arizona’s bill is to-tally applicable for every illegal immigrant, and Canadians are afraid of being sent back to Nova Scotia), and we prevent gay and lesbian Americans from marrying in about 90 percent of the U.S., we see a different forecast for human rights. How about we ask these groups if they see their future as largely upbeat?

Letters to the Editor
Columnist gets facts wrong 
Bryan Griffin is a little quick to jump to 
the conclusion that America was founded on 
Judeo-Christian philosophies in his Thursday column. He assumes, as many others have before him, the God mentioned in the Decla-
ration of Independence is the God of Judaism 
and Christianity.
Actually , many of the founding fathers 
were not Christians at all; they were deists. De-ists believe that a supreme being, called God or Nature’s God, created the universe and left it to its own devices. 
This is the God that Thomas Jefferson, who 
remixed the Gospels to highlight Jesus’ moral 
teachings and remove references to his divin-
ity , name drops in the opening sentence of the Declaration.

Pastor to taint Christianity more than 
Islam
Ray Bradbury’s “Fahrenheit 451” is re-
quired reading in many schools. I wonder if 
the Rev . Terry Jones has ever understood its message. A famous refrain in the novel about a fireman who doesn’t put out fires, but starts 
them, is that you “don’t face a problem, you 
burn it.” It is the  utter stupidity of this ap-proach Bradbury tries to address in his novel.  
The ultimate treasure mankind has is its 
books. Is it any wonder, then, that books are the fuel of choice for Guy Montag in the fires he chooses to start? It is through books that we ultimately understand each other. 
Through books, we are forced to confront 
our greatest problems and our greatest fears. Nowhere is that need to understand each other more crucial than in reading religious scripture.  
Jones may claim Islam is not a religion, and 
that its holy book is not from God. He alleges the Quran espouses hatred and extremism, yet confesses to never having studied it. Had he bothered to read it, he would have learned that it affirms the Bible’s teaching that  if you kill one man you kill all of mankind and en-joins them to “not create disorder in the earth.” So, Terry Jones, instead of calling on moderate Muslims to build bridges of tolerance and un-derstanding in the U.S. and, instead of work-ing as an interfaith community to eradicate ex-tremism of all faiths from the world, chooses to erect walls of hatred, rather than working toward love, as Jesus Christ taught. Like Guy Montag, he doesn’t face a problem, he burns 
it. He needs to face the fact that extremist ele-
ments can be found in all faiths, and the words of all scriptures, including the Bible, can be exploited to serve twisted political ends and means that have nothing to do with what the founder of any religion preaches.  
Don’t childishly decide to run from the 
problem of extremism in the one senseless act of burning the holy book of Islam and be-
come an extremist yourself. Don’t, quite liter -
ally , fight fire with fire. What good will that 
achieve?  
The whole world knows that all this will 
do is antagonize Muslims, including patriotic American Muslims.
If you truly stand for peace and love for all 
of mankind, as Jesus Christ taught, then you, Terry Jones, will not hurt their feelings and toy 
with their sentiments. You will show love for 
your fellow Muslim neighbors and do unto them as you would have them do unto you. That is the true message of Jesus Christ.
Did you even know, Terry Jones, the Quran 
you are so intent on burning contains an en-tire chapter dedicated to the Virgin Mary and recounts the miracles of Jesus, affirming his Virgin birth?  In your ignorance you have not 
even bothered to read it. 
On Sept. 11, when you burn the Quran, 
please don’t tarnish your beautiful faith in this 
senseless act.

Reason better model of government 
than religion
In his Thursday column, Bryan Griffin ar -
gues,  “our country’s founding is inseparable 
from Judeo-Christian philosophies.”  What Griffin fails to do is provide even one example of what a Judeo-Christian philosophy might look like, even though there are apparently several. As it stands, “Judeo-Christian philoso-phies” is simply a buzz-phrase. 
Its popularity in ordinary discourse is un-
deserved; its vagueness allows it to mean any-thing while explaining nothing.  Griffin further argues to disassociate “civil 
rights” from Judeo-Christian philosophy —namely, “moral obligation” and “a higher power” — is to “devalue our liberty as Ameri-cans.” 
What is missing from this claim is any 
kind of reason to believe it. Griffin attempts to sidestep this by claiming this disassociation could lead to “the reinstitution of slavery or discrimination at the behest of a majority,” ap-parently failing to recognize that throughout history, slavery and discrimination have been routinely justified with reference to the God and the “Judeo-Christian philosophies” that 
Griffin so admires.  
Griffin apparently believes adherence to 
Judeo-Christian philosophy is necessary to 
fully appreciate the rights of man. I would ar -
gue, however, that the whims of a deity , and the divisiveness of religious doctrines (even within a given religion) are poor substitutes for rational, secular discourse about our rights in the public sphere — reason, not religion, be-
ing the universal faculty of man.

Dove members blasphemous
I have read the Dove World Outreach 
Center intends to burn copies of the Quran 
Sept. 11. This is profound ignorance, straight 
and simple, and it is hypocritical.
Has Christianity forgotten all of its cen-
turies of untold violence and divisiveness? 
There is far more violence in the Bible than 
in the Quran. And how many millions of 
women did the Christian church massacre in 
Europe over several centuries because they 
were considered witches? 
Such actions show religious doctrine does 
not give one a relationship with God. They 
are only belief structures, of which there are many, and their adherents can behave like cult followers as often as not.
Christ, Buddha, Mohammed, Krishna 
and others came and gave their beautiful teachings. It is people who formed religions 
around them and burried these lessons in 
muck.
Often, diamonds are taken from the coal. Religions do the reverse; they construct
theological coal around the diamond of 
teaching.
And to use the word “dove” in the 
church’s name, considering it intends to burn another religion’s holy book, might be considered blasphemous by some Chris-
tians. After all, the descending dove is ico-
nography depicting the baptism of Jesus 
— Christ being the embodiment of love and not book-burning hatred. And the dove is a universal symbol of peace. The church-goers 
should remember that fact.

Gainesville draws international atten -
tion for all the wrong reasons
For all the clear-minded, innovative 
scholars who study in Gainesville, the town 
has drawn the international attention of the Associated Press and the top commander in Afghanistan because of the grossly igno-rant, misguided gestures of the Dove World Outreach Center, which plans to burn the Quran Sept. 11.  Spare the idle criticisms of the Quran. The overarching consideration is millions of people across the world have an interpretation of Islam that they say influ-ences them to live peacefully and produc-tively.  
The Bible, too, can be criticized on literal 
grounds. For centuries, its literal adherents militantly opposed the scientific teachings of Copernicus, Galileo, Newton and Dar -
win, among many others, and claimed the Bible justified such things as slavery, massa -
cres against Jews and discrimination against women.  That’s OK though, because mil-lions of Christians hold an interpretation of Christianity that leads them to live peaceful-ly, productively and tolerantly toward those with differing beliefs.  
I, along with many other Gainesville resi-
dents, wish the Dove World Outreach Cen-ter would fit that description.

poses for a photo.
� THE GATOR ALUMNUS HAS 
BEEN IN UF’S AFRICAN DANCE CLASS FOR 15 YEARS.
By KARINA LISENBEE  
Alligator Contributing Writer
If you walked into UF’s West Af-
rican Dance and Music class on Mon-
day and Wednesday evenings, you’d 
see just what you’d expect — a class full of college students. 
And then there’s Howie.Howard Reynolds, an 87-year-old 
Gainesville local, has been taking UF’s West African Dance and Music class for the past 15 years.
“People don’t expect to see an old 
guy in here,” Reynolds said. “But I have no intention of ever stopping.”
Reynolds moved from St. Simons 
Island, Ga., to Gainesville in 1992. 
He then enrolled in non-credit act-
ing and dancing courses at the univer -
sity.
Reynolds has only had one steady 
job  working as a marketing special-ist,  he has performed in many danc-
ing and acting improvisations over 
the years. 
“My steps are never planned. I just 
go where my body takes me,” Reyn-
olds said. “I am completely fearless.”
He worked as the opportunities 
came along, including part-time jobs with radio and television production 
and writing off-Broadway plays. His income was sporadic, but he always got by.  
“I wasn’t interested in going to 
work every day,” Reynolds said. 
He has recited monologues, per -
formed expressive dances influenced by Edgar Allan Poe’s poetry and has 
been involved in UF dance and acting 
productions. 
“He’s been coming since I’ve been 
teaching, and his efforts always put 
me in a good mood,” said Mohamed 
DaCosta, a professor of World Dance and Intercultural Performance and West African Dance and Music at  UF. 
UF sophomore Liz Stein saw Reyn-
olds take center stage at the end of class when students danced individu-ally in a circle. 
“Howie took us all by surprise,” 
Stein said. “I was impressed because I’m nervous to go in the circle.”
While Reynolds is not married, 
does not have children and said he 
has never been interested in being 
part of a family, UF and its dance classes have given him a place to call his second home.  
“I don’t come here for exercise,” 
Reynolds said. “I can do all the exer -
cise I want at home. I come to interact. I come to allow my center to go out into the world.”Dancer still gets groove on at 87
“I don’t come here for 
exercise.I can do all the exer -
cise I want at home. I come 
to interact. I come to allow 
my center to go out into the 
world.”

TEEING OFF WITH ANTHONY CHIANG alligatorSports Podcast INSIDE THE GATORS MISHANDLED NINE EXCHANG-

There were miscues aplenty in the Gators’ season-
opening win against Miami (Ohio) on Saturday, but 
the most lasting image of UF’s struggles is the mishan-dled and errant snaps between center Mike Pouncey 
and quarterback John Brantley.
The pair worked on shotgun snaps before and after 
Sunday’s practice, and Pouncey has made three ad-
justments to try and avoid a repeat performance. He’ll use a towel to keep his hands dry, focus on keeping a stiff wrist and move his grip to the top of the foot-ball.
“I’m the leader of the offense,” said Pouncey, a 
team captain and member of the watch list for the 
Rimington Trophy, given to the nation’s best cen-
ter. “When your leader is mess-ing up, it makes everything look bad. It’s just not expected out of me, so I’ve been busting my tail. 
“I haven’t 
been able to sleep all week since the game.”

UF SOCCER

After taking care of business in their 
first five matches of the year, the No. 7 
Gators embark on their toughest match of 
the young season as they head to Tallahas-see to face No. 5  Florida State on Friday.
The Gators are coming off their biggest 
blowout of the season after defeating Jack-
sonville 6-0 last Friday. 
Florida now starts a strenuous five-
game road trip.
“This team that we have this year I’ve 
really been enjoying,” coach Becky Bur -
leigh said. “We tried to push them to their 
physical limits and mentally challenge them.”
After coming off a less-than-stellar per -
formance against San Diego State on Aug. 29, Florida bounced back, playing with much better drive and consistency. Six different UF players put the ball in 
the net.
“One of the themes for this team is we 
just want to be relentless against our op-ponents,” Burleigh said. “That’s one of the things we emphasized in practice and the games, and so far the team has really re-
sponded.” 
The Gators have relied on their defen-
sive play through their first five games.
They have posted shutouts in four  
matches with a brand-new center back, 
former attacker Ashlee Elliott. 
“As a player, I’ve always been my hard-
est judge,” Elliott said. “As a fifth-year (player), I feel like sometimes I have to 
take it upon myself to figure out a situa-
tion by myself knowing that the coaches trust me.”
Going into what will be her hardest 
match of the year thus far, Elliott knows she has to be alert at all times. “You can’t screw up,” she said. “You 
always have to be on your toes because 
there’s no one behind you. 
“You (think you) have more time than 
you really do, so you have to be a good 
judge of that.” 
The transition from a different position 
for Elliott has been a rough road, but she 
continues to make im-provements from game to game.
“I like center back,” El-
liott said. “Its just a tough transition at this point 
just because I have so much pressure on myself, 
which I put on myself be-
cause I came back (for a fifth season after 
suffering a torn ACL in 2009).
“It’s all about paying attention to detail 
and knowing my role as center back” 
The Gators have shown faith in Elliott’s ability to grow as a defender, putting her at a focal part of the back line.
“That’s a really important position for 
us,” Burleigh said. “It takes a lot of leader -
ship and motivation and Ashlee has done a tremendous job. 
“The thing I’m most impressed with is 
the ability to come back and be efficient and lead the team.”
After defeating all of their in-state op-
ponents so far this season, Elliott and the 
Gators are ready to face the challenge that 
awaits in garnet and gold. They hope to at-tack the Seminoles with a “relentless” at-titude this week.
“In the back line, we just need to trust 
each other and feed off each other and learn that playing with each other we will get better,” Elliott said. 
“Hopefully by the time we play FSU we 
can be fully dominant in the back and in the front.”Florida to rely on Elliott, defense during tough road trip

he should inscribe a Bible verse on his eye black too. ... If Boise State finishes 
the 2010 season undefeated and fails to make the national championship game again, I think the Broncos should just become a Division II school. They would never make the BCS title game anyway. Kyle Maistri, Tyler Jett and Mike

Addazio: I don’t know if Nixon, Patchan will be healthy for Saturday
sulting in one lost fumble and 
negative-60 yards. Brantley also dropped one chest-high snap for a loss of seven, had to pluck four from near his ankles and while 
one high snap led to a fumbled 
handoff.
Brantley, UF coach Urban 
Meyer and offensive coordinator Steve Addazio all said Pouncey hadn’t struggled in practices prior to Saturday, and Addazio was quick to come to Pouncey’s defense.
“Those things weren’t all Mike 
Pouncey, so let’s get that clear,” Addazio said. “He had a couple of [bad snaps], and he’s address-ing it. I’ve said this before and I’ll say it again. You’re talking about one of the best offensive linemen in college football, if not the best, who has played that position for 
over a year.”
He added: “I’m not the least 
bit concerned about Mike Pounc-
ey. Not even a little.”
Gators fall in AP poll: Flori-
da’s 34-12 win sent it the wrong direction in the AP poll.
UF was ranked fourth in the preseason poll but fell to No. 8 this week, its lowest ranking in that poll since Oct. 5, 2008, when the Gators checked in at No. 11.
Alabama retained the top spot, 
and five other Southeastern Con-ference teams landed in the top-25: Arkansas (14th), LSU (19th), Auburn (21st), Georgia (22nd) and South Carolina (24th).
FSU moved up three spots to 
No. 17.
Patchan, Nixon still doubt-
ful: Addazio said Tuesday he wasn’t sure whether tackles Matt 
Patchan (wrist) and Xavier Nixon 
(knee) would be healthy in time for this weekend’s tilt with South Florida.
Their absences — along with 
the suspension of Carl Johnson — led to shuffling on the offensive line, with Maurice Hurt moving from guard to tackle and tackle

MIAMI — Bill Parcells is putting his pro-
tege in charge.
The Miami Dolphins’ football czar has 
given control of the team to general manager 
Jeff Ireland but will retain a role as a daily con-
sultant. The Dolphins announced the move in a three-sentence statement Tuesday , five days before the start of the season.
The change was part of a long-range plan 
when the Parcells regime took over at the end of the 2007 season, the statement said.
“This was the intent of the structure put in 
place in the past,” the Dolphins said. Ireland 
will assume full control over all aspects re-
garding the team and support staff.
Parcells joined the Dolphins in December 
2007 as executive vice president of football op-erations, then hired Ireland two weeks later. The 69-year-old Parcells can leave Miami at any time and collect the balance of the $12 mil-
lion due him under a four-year contract that 
expires after the 2011 season.
He was hired by Wayne Huizenga as the 
Dolphins staggered to the end of a 1-15 sea-son in 2007. In the Parcells regime’s first year in 2008, Miami made a great leap forward to 11-6.
Last season the Dolphins regressed to 7-9, 
extending their drought without a postseason 
victory to nine years.
During the past offseason, the team ac-
quired Pro Bowl receiver Brandon Marshall, 
hired Mike Nolan as defensive coordinator and revamped the defense. The front office has continued to be busy in recent days, acquiring six players since Saturday , and the Dolphins have 20 players with two years’ experience or less.
Owner Stephen Ross has said he expects 
the Dolphins to play in the Super Bowl this season.
The news that Parcells was stepping back 
caught linebacker Channing Crowder by sur -
prise.
“He’s just a great guy to have on your 
side,” Crowder said. “But he brought a bunch of great people in, too. Tony is an amazing coach, and Jeff Ireland knows what he’s do-
ing.”
There was no comment 
from the secretive organi-zation about the change in hierarchy beyond the state-ment. The team was off Tuesday , and Parcells rarely 
does interviews.
“The clock’s ticking for 
guys like me,” he said in 
2008, shortly before his first season with Mi-
ami. “You know you can’t do it forever.”
Ireland rarely talks to the media but offered occasional glimpses into the how the regime worked under Parcells. For example, Parcells 
was very much involved in preparations for the most recent draft, Ireland said in April.
“It’s constant,” Ireland says. “It never stops. 
Bill and I have grinded through every single player two or three times.”
There have been occasional hints that Par -
cells had created an atmosphere allowing him to step back. One clue came when Sparano 
spoke two weeks ago of Dan Henning, the 
Dolphins’ third-year offensive coordinator.
“Our relationship has really grown tre-
mendously ,” Sparano said. “Early on in the process he was a Bill guy . And now I would feel safe to say he’s a Tony guy.”
Ireland spent seven years in player person-
nel with the Cowboys, including his final three as vice president of college and pro scouting.

final season there.Parcells surrenders control of Dolphins personnel “I’m not the least bit con -
cerned about Mike Pounc -

Miscues dotted Florida’s season-opening win against Miami (Ohio), but the most 
memorable mistakes took place on shotgun snaps between center Mike Pouncey and quarterback John Brantley. It has been widely discussed since, with conflict -
ing reports of how many bad snaps there were. To settle the issue, alligatorSports staff writer Mike McCall heroically battled a slow Internet connection to rewatch each of UF’s 56 offensive plays. He broke down what went wrong in the first in -
stallment of a new weekly feature: the alligatorSports Tale of the Tape.
3rd and 10, MU 43:  Pouncey snaps low and hard past Brantley’s left knee. The scramble for the ball ends 33 yards 
later, where the RedHawks recover at the UF 24.2nd and 5, UF 46:  Brantley catches the snap at his ankles and throws to Chris Rainey on a swing pass. Rainey gains 
one yard.2nd and 3, MU 38:  Brantley has to lean over and pluck the snap from just above his shoelaces. The play results in 
a high, incomplete pass to Carl Moore across the middle.
2nd and 3, MU 14:  Brantley catches the snap below his knees but is able to hand off to running back Jeff Demps, 
who picks up the first down.
4th and 5, MU 40:  Brantley catches the snap below his right knee. The play results in a two-yard comple-
tion to Chris Rainey and a turnover on downs.
1st and 10, UF 22: Pouncey’s snap is on target, but Brantley drops it and loses seven yards on the play.
2nd and 17, UF 15: A play later, Pouncey’s skims the ball across the grass to Brantley’s left. Brantley 
recovers at his own 1-yard line.2nd and 8, MU 17: Pouncey snaps high and to Brantley’s right, close to running back Emmanuel Moody. 
Moody comes in front of Brantley for the handoff, but Brantley can’t pull it down in time and they fumble 
the handoff for a loss of five yards.
2nd and 8, MU 12:  Pouncey snaps low and hard, just past Brantley’s left foot. Brantley
recovers for a loss of 13.16, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 8, 2010
The Gators’ quarterback summarized 
his team’s inept play rather simply.
“We had too many mistakes,” he 
said. “We didn’t execute the way we could have.”
Florida’s offense only saved face because 
it was bailed out by defensive turnovers. Its rushing attack was clogged by predictabil-ity and inconsistent blocking. The passing game? Even more out of sync.
In short, that 2005 loss to LSU was bad.Doubts lingered about Urban Meyer’s 
spread offense throughout his first year in Gainesville. The system did not allow you to 
“run the ball consistently,” a term synony-
mous in the SEC with “win consistently.” At the very least, the spread option was ineffec-tive with immobile quarterback Chris Leak in the shotgun.
Five years and two national champion-
ships later, Meyer doesn’t need to defend his offense. But when he said this year’s ver -
sion would be a throwback to the Leak days, 
fans should have seen the red flags against 
Miami (Ohio).
Saturday’s 212-yard performance was 
the worst the school has seen since that 206-yard effort against LSU. But breathe easy; one game is too small a sample size to draw conclusions.
The Gators can win with a pocket pass-er like John Brantley. They won a national championship in 2006 with Leak. But, like 
four years ago, UF’s offense needs a change-
of-pace quarterback to take pressure off its starter.
During his town hall meeting with stu-
dents two weeks ago, Meyer dispelled the belief that his offense is about “finesse.” He wants his team to smash opponents in the mouth, he said. And in the weeks leading to this season, he was more confident in Flori-da’s running backs than ever. 
But Meyer’s Gators have never estab-
lished a dominant running attack without a mobile quarterback. When Leak gained just 81 yards on the ground in 2005, Florida’s rushing offense ranked fifth in the confer -
ence.
Leak wasn’t a threat with his legs, and 
defenses focused on Florida’s running backs. 
The option, Meyer’s bread and butter, was 
one-dimensional.
Those woes were alleviated by Tim 
Tebow’s arrival in 2006, when the Gators’ running game improved to the second best in the SEC. But Florida still relied on Leak.
Compared to his previous season, Leak 
attempted just five fewer passes for about nine fewer yards per game in 2006. The 
addition of an option quarterback did not 
marginalize his role. It merely adjusted his responsibilities.
Brantley is the key 
to Florida’s offensive success this season. But, without a mo-
bile quarterback, the 
team’s running game looked anemic. Re-move outliers — the 72- and 41-yard runs by Jeff Demps and Mike Gillislee, and 
the negative-55 yards coming from fumbled snaps — and the Gators averaged 1.6 yards 
per carry.
Much of Florida’s ground trouble can be 
attributed to its mixed-and-mashed offen-
sive line. Even so, modeling Brantley’s role after the 2006 version of Leak rather than the 2005 edition would boost UF’s running at-tack.
Freshman Trey Burton is not ready to be 
a starting quarterback. Neither was Tebow 
his first season, yet he was essential to the 
offense’s transformation. 
Seventy-three percent of Tebow’s plays in 
2006 were runs. Regardless, the offense was effective because the option has, well, plenty of options. 
Sure, you know the Gators will run. But 
how? Will the quarterback keep the ball? Will he pitch it? Why is that receiver going in motion? And pay attention to the tight end. 
They might be setting up a shovel pass.
Burton did not see the field much last Sat-
urday, but he flashed promise with his goal-
line touchdown run — one of the few bright spots in UF’s short-yardage run game.
Meyer needs a smash-mouth attack to 
win. Brantley can’t run a smash-mouth of-fense. But the Gators can still win with him.
They just need to add a variable.
Gators should plug Burton into equation to solve familiar problem
