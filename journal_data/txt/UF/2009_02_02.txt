STUDENT LIFEn FEW PEOPLE FELT STRONG TIES TO 
EITHER TEAM.

As championship games go, Super Bowl 
XLIII was a relaxed affair in Gainesville.                         
Many residents watched the game at 
home with friends and few stuck to die-hard 
allegiances as the Pittsburgh Steelers took on the Arizona Cardinals.
“This is more of a house party kind of 
day,” said Hoss Rice, a manager at Gator’s Dockside.
With only 32 teams in the NFL, there 
are not many fans in Gainesville who have a strong attachment to any given team, he said.
Gator’s Dockside provided food for par-
ties, selling take-out bags of 500 chicken wings for $220, which is $159 less than menu price. They also had a smaller, 100-wing bag. Dockside sold about 10 of the large orders and 30 of the smaller orders, Rice said.
Faren Hely, one of the few cheering the 
Cardinals at Dockside, sported a San Francisco 49ers jersey and was there to support her di-Gainesville tame for Super Bowl Sunday

Rising unemployment and falling 
income may cause more UF students to change their financial aid status during the 2009-2010 academic year, according to UF officials.    
Family income could decrease be-
tween the time students apply for aid and the time it is disbursed, moving many to have their financial aid sta-tus reevaluated.                             
“We are anticipating that as 
more and more people become un-employed, the chances of having students petitioning is going to be 
greater,” said Rick Wilder, the associ-
ate director of financial aid advising for UF’s Office for Student Financial Affairs.                                                  
Students who have their financial 
status reevaluated could receive aid that they were previously ineligible for, Wilder said.                            
 Students should apply for finan-
cial aid as early as possible so they 
have a better chance of getting the 
financial aid package they want, he said.       Crisis alters aid status
A Gainesville man was arrested Friday in 
connection with a false bomb threat posted 
to the Alachua County Sheriff’s Office Web site.
At 7:34 p.m. on Thursday, Joshua Cheek, 
18, typed that there were explosives in the Alachua County Civil, Criminal and Federal Courthouses, an ACSO news release stated.
The three courthouses were searched but 
nothing was found, according to the release.
On Friday morning, a man noticed Cheek 
typing another bomb threat on an Alachua County Library computer. The library staff called 911 and locked the computer terminal so they could gather information about the threat, the report stated.
Detective Thom Kinsey identified Cheek 
when he walked out of the library, based on library em-
ployees’ descriptions. Cheek 
immediately told Kinsey that 
he did not mean to make the threats and also admitted to posting a threat Thursday night.
Cheek was charged with making a false 
report of planting an explosive device.
This is not the first time Cheek made a 
bomb threat, according to the report.

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) — A 
Florida veteran has pleaded guilty to 
falsely claiming four Purple Hearts, when he had none.
Charles T. White of St. Augustine 
pleaded guilty Friday in Jacksonville federal court. Defense attorney Charles Truncale says White “recognizes he was wrong.”
White served in the Navy and the Marine Corps. But prosecutors said he 
improperly wore a Purple Heart medal 
on several occasions in the past year and 
falsely told a military newspaper that he 
had been awarded the medal four times.
White now faces up to two years in 
prison and a $200,000 fine. Truncale says 
White is likely to receive probation.

who are wounded or killed in action.Man pleads guilty to falsely claiming four Purple Hearts n UF guard Erving

Students began interviewing for 
spots on Student Government party 
tickets Friday. 
About 97 students came by to 
register with a party in hopes of be-coming a candidate for one of the 50 available Student Senate seats that represent UF’s colleges. 
Four out of the seven regis-
tered parties conducted interviews: Orange and Blue, LAN, Progress and Unite, said Supervisor of 
Elections Dan Siegel. 
The Gator, Keg and Swamp par-
ties opted to not participate, he said. 
About 30 students registered 
with the Orange and Blue Party, 
about 25 registered with the Progress Party and about 40 registered with 
the Unite Party, according to party 
leaders.
“We’ve had a pretty high turn-
out,” said Siegel, who described the first day as normally the slowest. 
During the eight hours of inter-
viewing in the Reitz Union, students walked around and spoke with par-ty representatives before choosing which parties to interview with. 
UF sophomore Russell Ward 
said he settled on the Unite Party because of its bipartisan vision. 
Other students who showed up 
for interviews had already decided which parties to inteview with. UF freshman Nick Alsaka interviewed with the Progress Party because he felt it bridged party lines, he said. 
This was because Progress con-
sisted of former members of the Gator Party and the Orange and Blue Party – the two  parties that currently hold power in Senate.
“It’s something new,” he said. 
“It’s not the same old ways.” 
Orange and Blue Party and Unite 
Party leaders said they expected a 
full ticket by the end of interviews. 
Progress Party presidential can-
didate Ben Dictor said although 
having a full ticket is one goal of the newly-formed party, it is not as im-portant as having a diverse one. 
“We’re looking to have a ticket as 
diverse as the university,” he said. 
Not all snagged candidates for 
their party’s ticket, however. 
LAN Party President Kevin 
Seymour, who has not been in-volved with SG before, said no one interviewed with his party on Friday but hopes the next two days will bring better results.
Seymour said he created LAN 
after he saw the disconnect dur-
ing Senate meetings over the past 
semester between the Gator and Orange and Blue parties.
Although Seymour is not offi-
cially involved in SG, he attended meetings and talked to senators to become educated with the proceed-
ings.
“It’s a play on words,” he said, 
referring to a Local Area Network, 
which is used to connect separate gaming systems so all players can participate. “The LAN party is all about connections.”
Orange and Blue, Progress and 
Unite party leaders spoke abot the new candidates’ fresh perspective. 
Orange and Blue Party Leader 
Sen. Ben Cavataro said applicants brought new issues and ideas to the table. 
“There were some ideas for 
change I had never heard before,” he said. 
Student Body Presidential can-
didate Jordan Johnson of the Unite Party noted the turnout of under-
classmen. 
“There were a lot of younger 
students, which is good to see,” 
Johnson said. “They’ll play a role in shaping Student Government in the future.”

Students, teachers, children, 
environmental activists and 
professional cyclists took to the streets Friday for Gainesville’s Second Annual Community 
Rock ‘n’ Ride.  
About 200 cyclists partici-
pated in the 6-mile commu-nity ride, confusing motorists on West University Avenue, 
Southwest 13th Street and Main Street.
The bicycling event, in 
conjunction with Gainesville Critical Mass, commemo-rated the first anniversary of the Gainesville Community Bicycle Project, Inc., known as 
The Kickstand. Critical Mass is an interna-
tional collective bike ride to 
raise aware-
ness of cy-clists’ rights 
to the road, 
said Andrew Carr, a UF archi-
tecture junior.
Carr said Friday’s crowd 
was the largest he has ever 
seen in Gainesville. “A lot of cyclists feel mar-
ginalized in a sea of cars,” he 
said. “We try to reverse the situation.”  
During the ride, cyclists 
cheered, laughed, waved to cars, rang their bells and oc-casionally broke out into song. When a lone cyclist would ride by, they called “come, join us” 
to invite him or her. 
UF sophomore Matthew 
McCagg was one of the bicy-
clists who blocked traffic from 
side roads to allow the group 
to stay together when crossing intersections, a tactic known as corking.
“This is way more danger-
ous than I thought it would be,” McCagg said.
Dirk Drake, a social sci-
ences teacher for Westwood 
Middle School, rode alongside 
his son, Captain, 10, and his son’s friend, Ella, 9.  
Drake said he has been riding 
in Critical Mass since the 80s. 
He has ridden in cities across 
the country such as Savannah, Ga., and Washington, D.C. 
“It’s a hands-on way for 
them to make a connection with healthier modes of trans-portation,” Drake said. “It’s 
healthy for our bodies and the 
planet.”4, ALLIGATOR MONDAY, FEBRUARY 2, 2009

MOLO, Kenya — An oil spill 
from a crashed truck erupted into 
flames Saturday in Kenya, killing at 
least 89 people who were trying to scoop up free fuel, officials said.

said 89 people died and more than 
200 were injured died after a crowd gathered around the crash in search of free fuel.
The crash was in Molo, several

UF administrators, alumni and 
students gathered to celebrate the 
start of Black History Month on 
Sunday night.
The opening ceremony, which 
featured dancers, poets and speakers, promoted equality and 
a break from a black-and-white 
vision of America.
About 240 people attended 
the event, which was held at UF’s 
Reitz Union Grand Ballroom and 
kicked off the month’s festivities.After a skit addressing the 
struggles of slavery, UF President Bernie Machen spoke.
Machen’s presentation was fol-
lowed by a speech from Pamela 
Bingham, the first and only black 
female Student Body president at UF.                                                                                                                                    
In his speech, Machen refer-
enced the first black students at 
UF and their role in the univer-
sity’s integration more than 50 years ago.
“Courage and leadership 
have an uncanny way of open-ing doors and opening minds,” he said, adding that UF is still not diverse enough.
The struggle with equality in 
our nation’s living history con-tinues, he said.                                               
SG alumna Pamela Bingham 
knows of this struggle. In a speech sandwiched 
between standing ovations, Bingham said she received death threats on her answering ma-chine while running for Student 
Body president in 1986.     
“How you respond to adver-
sity at the end of the day defines 
who you are, and sometimes, you know, you just have to encourage 
yourself,” Bingham said.
In the wake of President 
Obama’s inauguration, she spoke 
about America’s dream of equal-
ity and said it’s a work in prog-
ress.    In an interview after her 
speech, Bingham offered advice to UF students about continuing diversity efforts.                             
She said students should force 
themselves to get to know people they would not ordinarily meet. She said they should work to-ward making student organiza-tions more diverse.
Nicole Douglas, the executive 
director of Black History Month, had some advice of her own.                                                               
“Wake up to your own abili-
ties,” she said “Wake up to your own promise.” Black History Month kicks off with opening ceremony

A Gainesville man was arrested Friday 
night after he was found hiding from po-lice under a bed.
When a Gainesville police officer saw 
a man leaving a known drug corner on a bicycle, the officer attempted to stop the man for having improper bicycle lights at night, according to GPD.
When the man saw the officer, he quick-
ly pedaled away. According to the GPD ar-
rest report, Lt. Scott Meffen ran after him 
while shouting, “stop, police.”
The man ran to Gardenia Gardens 
Apartments at 1727 N.E. Eighth Ave., 
threw down his bicycle and went into 
Apartment 8C, the report stated.
“When officers spoke to the resident 
of the apartment, she swore up and down that the man had run in and out and was 
no longer there,” said GPD spokesman Keith Kameg. “She even allowed them to search her apartment to prove he wasn’t 
inside.”
While searching the apart-
ment, police found Otis 
McFadden, 28, hiding under the bed in one of the rooms, 
Kameg said.
During the search, officers found a 
brown paper bag with 38 grams of mari-juana that was individually packaged for street level sale, the report stated.
There were 12 one-gram bags, one two-
gram bag and three eight-gram sandwich bags.
McFadden said it was for his personal 
use.
McFadden was charged with one felony 
and three misdemeanors including posses-sion of drug paraphernalia, trespassing on 
posted property and resisting an officer 
without violence. 
McFadden has been convicted of 11 fel-
onies, Kameg added.Man with marijuana found hiding from GPD under bed

Today’s question: Are you happy with the results of the Super Bowl?Friday’s question: Are Super Bowl commercials better than the actual game?69% YES31% NO
178 TOTAL VOTESAd Overload
Super Bowl spots offer 
viewers a distraction
Beyond the highlight reel sacks and gut-busting grub, the 
true allure of the Super Bowl lies in catching the latest in advertising excellence.
From “Mean” Joe Greene showing his softer side in a Coke 
commercial to Apple’s Orwellian effort in 1984, the big game has 
often taken a backseat to fans more consumed with Budweiser’s 
latest offering than the final score.
To honor the country’s time-tested fascination with Super 
Bowl ads, the Editorial Board offers you a run-down of some of the best (and, well, not so great) ads from Sunday’s game.
Bud Light At Staff Meetings: What happens when you sug-
gest eliminating Bud Light from staff meetings? You get thrown out the window — seat and all. At least the guy in question didn’t seem too hurt after surviving a pretty treacherous fall.
Pepsi’s “Forever Young”: From Bob Dylan to will.i.am, 
Pepsi’s commercial presented a refreshing take on America by juxtaposing the ‘60s and present-day. Quite the apropos offer-ing to remind us why our country is so great.
Doritos’ “Crystal Ball”: Doritos started the night off quite 
strongly as we learned throwing a crystal ball is good for get-ting free chips, but a terrible idea for getting a job promotion.
Bud Light’s Conan O’Brien Commercial: O’Brien’s agent 
convinces him to make a commercial that he promises will nev-
er been seen in the states. Predictable, though still quite funny, 
O’Brien becomes the laughingstock of Manhattan as the ad gets played in Times Square. 
Doritos’ “Crunch”: Solidifying its place as this year’s big 
winner, Doritos’ second commercial was even better than the first. Who wouldn’t want to eat a snack food that caused ATMs to spit out cash?
Budweiser’s “Daisy”: After a lackluster spot featuring a 
Clydesdale fetching a tree branch, Budweiser totally redeemed 
itself by telling the love story between two horses smitten with 
each other. Aw, how cute is that?
Cash4Gold’s “Fallen Stars”: The Editorial Board couldn’t 
help but laugh at MC Hammer and Ed McMahon as they poked fun at their fallen stars in this satirical masterpiece. What really caught our eye was McMahon’s gold-plated toilet — we won-der what the starting bid will be once it hits eBay.
Cars.com’s “David Abernathy”: Easily one of the most en-
gaging offerings of the evening as we meet David Abernathy — 
a young man born into the world already exuding confidence. 
Abernathy could perform open heart surgery with a pen at the opera, but he wasn’t confident enough to make a car purchase?
Bridgestone’s “On the Moon”: Apparently the moon can be 
a pretty rough place as two astronauts found out the hard way. After collecting moon rocks and goofing around, they return to their spaceship to see it up on blocks. We can safely assume they filmed this commercial in Detroit.
Teleflora’s “Boxed Flowers”: Ladies, if you receive boxed 
flowers on Valentine’s Day, it means whoever sent them to you “doesn’t want to see you naked.” Though, that sketchy co-worker in the ad probably wouldn’t mind.
Hardee’s “Mafia Hit”: The newest addition to the menu at 
Hardee’s is so messy it can save your life. Some poor schlub dripped tomato sauce all over himself, convincing two mafia hit men their work was already done. Somewhere Tony Soprano was shaking his head.
Careerbuilder.com’s “It May Be Time”: We found ourselves 
laughing out loud after seeing this commercial, which offers an entire laundry list of reasons why it is time to leave your job. Any ad that depicts fat men crying, women riding dolphins and 
an Asian man berating his co-worker is downright awesome in 
our book.

as John McCain’s running mate, doesn’t seem to have such a fondness for her home state anymore. 
Palin certainly wasn’t in Alaska this past weekend. 
Instead, she was in Washington devouring some lobster with the nation’s political and business elite at the pres-tigious Alfalfa Club’s annual dinner soiree. No word has escaped from the press-free event whether Palin was only invited to hand deliver some of Alaska’s finest crusta-
ceans. 
Certainly Palin must have felt awkward at the yearly 
Alfalfa gathering. She told members of the press that she 
was only going to the dinner because “President Obama 
is scheduled to be there.” That statement comes only four 
months after she exploited Obama’s association with “un-repentant domestic terrorist Bill Ayers.” Now Palin is will-ing to give a speech on the same stage as President Obama, who unapologetically “palled around with terrorists.” 
In Gov. Palin’s twisted game of guilt by association, 
doesn’t that make her an accomplice to domestic terror-ism, too? 
Yet the really awkward part isn’t Palin joining in 
on an elite dinner with the nation’s best and brightest, people from the fake America, from places like New York, Washington, Chicago, Miami and L.A. No, the re-ally awkward and uncomfortable part for Palin is her re-cently formed political action committee, cutely named 
SarahPAC, a move that all but signals a run for Congress 
or worst, a place on the GOP ticket in 2012. 
Little did she know that the ever-shrinking GOP still had a trick up its Brooks Brothers sleeve. 
Enter Michael Steele, stage 
right. 
Steele, a former lieutenant 
governor from Maryland, was elected the first black chairman 
of the beleaguered GOP. He’s 
already stolen Palin’s spot-light. He’s a moderate, modern 
Anwar Sadat look-a-like, and MSNBC’s Chris Matthews even voted for him in his failed bid for the U.S. Senate.  
Democrats have a lot to be jolly about right now. Our 
candidate won, and for the first time in my life, multiple polls show that a historically low number of Americans affiliate with the Republican Party. But there’s a new dy-
namic duo in town. 
Palin may be viewed as either naive or vacuous, but 
she’s not stupid — she just hasn’t learned enough. Give 
her four more years and she may be able to recapture the suburban middle-class voters who Amtrak-Joe won over 
to the blue team. And with Steele, having moderate po-
litical roots and a connection to a modern city, such as Baltimore, urban voters may soon be reachable again. 
Yet the duo should be reminded that the GOP didn’t 
lose because of demographics. They lost because they were on the wrong side of the issues. 
For her party’s sake, hopefully Palin listened in on 
some of the conversations at the Alfalfa dinner. The elit-ists and so-called “unrepentant terrorists” did pretty well 
last year.

editor@alligator.orgColumn
President Barack Obama has been 
in office for only about two weeks 
and, already, things have begun to 
change. 
Admittedly, no cherubim came down 
from the heavens—Hillary Clinton was 
right on that count—but we have already 
witnessed the undoing of several aspects of 
Dubya’s neoconservative agenda. 
Obama has already announced that he 
will close Guantanamo Bay within a year 
and has issued an executive order repeal-
ing the so-called global gag rule put in place 
by Bush II (who was undoing the work of 
Clinton, who was undoing the work of Bush 
I…). Another type of change has also become 
evident—the Republicans are now a united 
opposition party. The president’s stimulus 
plan failed to garner a single Republican vote 
in the House. 
Obama has set a fairly liberal-looking 
course during his first two weeks in office, 
but he will need to be cautious because, as 
both new president and liberal messiah, he has much less freedom than one might imag-
ine.
Obama is beginning his term with an un-
precedented amount of expectations on his 
broad, handsome shoulders. (Sorry, I seem to 
have channeled Silvio Berlusconi). A Gallup 
Poll found his approval rating shortly after 
entering office to be at a near-unprecedented 
69 percent. But people are notoriously fickle, 
especially when optimism soars, and any 
missteps on Obama’s part could give him a 
bloody nose from which recovery will be dif-
ficult.
PolitiFact.com, apparently willing to rain 
on the parade, compiled a list of Obama’s 
campaign promises. It is not entirely accurate, 
but since public perception is all that matters, 
that fact is irrelevant. 
It lists 510 promises with accompanying 
quotations. Its tally so far: Promises Kept: 6, 
Stalled: 1, In the Works: 17, Compromised: 
1, No Action: a daunting 484. It goes without saying--but what job would I have if I didn’t 
say it?--that Obama will be under intense scrutiny for each 
and every one of 
those promises. 
Such are the pit-
falls of being “The 
Great One.”
And so, we come 
to the razor’s edge 
on which Obama 
must walk. We have 
already seen that 
some Republicans are attempting to invigo-rate their party and their constituencies by 
mounting symbolic resistance to the new ad-
ministration.
If Obama veers too far left, Republicans 
will make life very difficult for him. This 
would go against Rule No. 1 of political hero-
ism: never let them see you sweat.
An easy fix, you may think: Obama can 
simply do what most presidents do and 
charge like the Light Brigade toward the center. Unfortunately, things are no longer 
that simple. The powers on the extreme left feel as though Obama is indebted to them. 
They helped him defeat the Inevitable Miss 
Clinton, and if he moves too far toward the 
center, you can be sure he will face their 
wrath. Markos Moulitsas and his charm-
ingly-named “Kossacks” have already at-
tacked Obama over a few of his more centrist 
moves. 
One can still feel that the attitude perme-
ates among these activists — stated most 
bluntly (and with a pinch of Orwell) by Eli 
Pariser, executive director of MoveOn.org in 
2004 — that “now it’s our party: we bought it, 
we own it and we’re going to take it back.” 
Obama is viewed by these elements as 
their property, and they will not hesitate to 
ill-use him if they don’t think he’s pursuing 
their interests with all his strength.
Obama must row carefully between the 
Scylla and Charybdis of too much partisan-
ship and not enough. But hey — it’s a heavy 
lies the crown sort of thing.

After watching one half of 
the biggest football game of the season, fans are all 
riled up. In order to cool all of those emotions and bring the adrenaline level down, the NFL wheels out its annual halftime show.
The toughest game in America 
stops and pop singers come on stage, just in time to interrupt any sort of passion fans are feel-ing. Instead of highlights from the game or, for that matter, the sea-son, fans are treated to 15 minutes of agony. 
Serious football fans retreat to 
the restrooms, to the fridge or just to change the channel. People at parties probably can’t even hear the performance. There are three performances, though, that stand out as being particularly bad:
3.) Super Bowl XXVII: Michael 
Jackson. Dallas Cowboys and Buffalo Bills fans were treated to a Michael Jackson performance during the 1993 Super Bowl XXVII game. Jackson sang in front of the thousands of screaming children crowded around the stage. This lawsuit-waiting-to-happen was full of theatrics and “The King of Pop’s” dancing abilities. 
Already starting to fall from 
the top, Jackson pulled the clas-sic “Billie Jean” out of the bag for about 20 seconds, and then moved on to “Heal 
the World.”
Noticeably, no one in the stands 
was actually cheering; only the kids that stood around the stage were. It was also clear that he was lip-syncing with a back-up track. Ask football fans what they want, and it probably won’t be Michael Jackson.
2.) Super Bowl XXXV: 
Aerosmith, ‘N Sync, Britney Spears, Mary J. Blige. The only thing worse than watching the Ravens stop the Giants in Superbowl XXXV was watching Aerosmith, ‘N Sync, Nelly, Britney Spears and Mary J. Blige perform “Walk this Way” during the halftime show. This strange assortment of artists de-livered an equally strange perfor-mance, with Nelly rapping his own lyrics in the song, Spears trying to match Steven Tyler vocally and Blige, presumably wondering why she accepted the gig, being walked down the stage with ‘N Sync. The worst part about it was the dance-off ‘N Sync and Aerosmith had at the beginning of the show.
1.) Super Bowl XXXVIII: Janet 
and Justin. The worst halftime show, however, came in 2004 as the Carolina Panthers played the New England Patriots. This, of course, is the infamous Janet Jackson “ward-robe malfunction,” in which singer Justin Timberlake ripped an article of clothing off Janet Jackson on stage in a choreographed dance. The incident did not do the show justice, though, because Kid Rock, P. Diddy and Nelly were there, too.
This “dream team” was likely 
the last possible cast fans of either team would want to listen to in the middle of a tremendous game.

The Gainesville Police Department is 
searching for a man suspected of com-
mitting a string of auto burglaries in Gainesville.
In January, Gainesville car burglar-
ies increased, said GPD spokesman Keith 
Kameg.
Kameg said some of the victims report-
ed their credit cards stolen.
“Because they were honest with their 
banking information, GPD was able to 
contact the businesses where their credit cards were used,” Kameg said.
The businesses provided GPD with video of their stores at the times that the credit cards were used.
Joseph Murray, 46, was in some of those 
videos using the stolen cards.
“We think he is linked to 
as many as eight auto bur-glaries,” Kameg said. 
Murray has warrants out 
for his arrest for grand theft and auto bur-glary, Kameg said.
Murray’s bonds total more than $47,000, he said.
Officials believe Murray ran away and 
is hiding in Palatka, Kameg said.
“The way that Murray gained access to 
most of the vehicles was through unlocked doors,” Kameg said. 
Other than credit cards, Kameg said iP-
ods, GPS tracking devices and other small electronics were stolen.
GPD asks anyone with information on 
Murray to call 352-955-1818.Police search for suspect in string of auto burglaries

Eric Reinhardt may not know 
much about doo-wop, but he does know just about everything else.                                                     
He took first place at the Third 
Annual North Florida Crossword Tournament, held at the Savannah Grande in downtown Gainesville, by making only one mistake.                                                 
When asked to identify a doo-
wop syllable, a reference to a genre of 50s music, he  wrote a “c” where the “s” should have been in “sha”. He finished his puzzle in a lo-
cal record-breaking 22 minutes.
About 70 people from around 
the  U.S.  participated in the tour-
nament Saturday morning.                                                                 
“We’re surrounded by the 
smartest people in Gainesville,” 
said Jeannette Peters, 49, who 
competed in the tournament.                                     
Reinhardt, a 72-year-old 
Jacksonville resident, won a trip 
to New York for the National Crossword Championship.                                           
“I just see little boxes that 
need letters put in them,” said Reinhardt, a retired computer programmer.                                                  During the final round, the 
top three contestants filled out large-scale puzzles in front of an audience. 
About 75 people watched the 
puzzlers, some of them scratch-ing out their own answers on ex-
tra copies.                                                                 
Merl Reagel, a  crossword ce-lebrity featured in the documen-
tary “Wordplay,” provided play-by-play analysis as the puzzles were being completed. 
The contestants could only 
vaguely hear him through ear-plugs and muffling headphones.                                              
“I wouldn’t wish that puzzle 
on my worst crossword enemy,” Reagel said. “Actually, make that my second worst crossword en-emy.”              
Reagel also created a puzzle 
for the competition, which fea-tured his distinct style of themed, corny clues. 
Reagel writes about one puz-zle per week for the New York Times.
“It was typical Merl,” 
Reinhardt said.                     
The puzzles theme was “types 
of rooms,” with clues leading to answers such as ‘back room’ and ‘mushroom.’                                                    
Many first-time crossword 
contest observers were surprised at how fun it was to watch and play along with the puzzlers.
“I’m not going to lie,” said 
Kristen Wilkie, 21, who volun-teered at the competition. “It’s a lot more exciting than I thought it would be.”

“I’m just more of a ‘let’s go out to a bar’ 
type person,” she said. “It’s much better 
than sitting on the couch at home.”
But Emily Bohler had a different ap-proach.
She held a house party with about 15 
friends. Nobody who attended the party 
was a die-hard fan of either team.                                           
“I’m for the Cardinals because they’re 
the underdogs,” said Anna Garrido, a se-nior at UF. 
Jill Dolan, 22, is a fan of the Miami Dolphins, but supported the Pittsburgh 
Steelers as her second choice. She was the 
only one at the party 
wearing a Steelers jersey.                                     
Another partier, Josh 
Lancaster, 24, said that 
the Super Bowl is just another excuse to get together. “We’re really just here having a party,” 
said Lancaster.
All the partygoers agreed that the 
slightly anticlimactic celebration after the Super Bowl was nowhere near as excit-
ing as when Gainesville rushed the streets 
following UF’s win in the BCS National Championship.Super Bowl victory celebrations pale in comparison to BCS aftermath
 And while UF advises students 
on the available options, a recent study found some students may 
not be taking advantage of aid 
available to them.
At last week’s Board of 
Governors meeting, a report es-
timated that about 22,000 under-
graduates at Florida public univer-sities failed to apply for Pell Grants in 2005, despite having a qualified financial status.
About $24 million of this fed-
eral, need-based aid went un-claimed, according to the report.   Wilder said UF’s Office for Student 
Financial Affairs does all it can to 
inform students of their options for financial aid.
UF starts educating students 
about these opportunities as early 
as middle or high school, he said.                                                     
Even with help from UF’s finan-cial advisers, however, students are still making sacrifices because 
of the recession’s effect on family 
income.            
Amber Wangle, a UF building construction graduate student, has no extra money to buy books and 
school supplies due to recent fam-
ily financial difficulties.
Wangle said she walks to school 
and eats at home daily to save money.                                                                    
If a student’s financial situation 
changes dramatically, he or she should seek help from their finan-cial aid advisers and discuss which options are available to them, 
Wilder said.                                                                                    
“Every situation is different, 
and it’s best to talk with a trained 
financial aid professional before you do anything,” he said.Recession ups financial need

STRAIGHT GAMES IN KNOXVILLE.
By MIKE DiFERDINANDO
Alligator Staff Writer
mdiferdinando@alligator.org
KNOXVILLE, Tenn. — All UF could 
do was watch in stunned silence as the 
deafening Tennessee crowd drowned out any hope of a second-half comeback.
More than 20,000 fans took to their 
feet as the Gators (18-4, 5-2 Southeastern Conference) walked off the floor at Thompson-Boling Arena to the tune of a 79-63 loss.
“That’s definitely the wildest crowd 
we’ve seen this year,” forward Chandler 
Parsons said. 
“It’s a crazy environment, and they 
don’t like us.”
The Gators chipped away at a 23-point 
second-half Volunteers lead and cut the 
deficit to 10 with 4:42 to play.
But the Volunteers closed out the game 
with a 15-9 flurry that proved to be too 
much to overcome. 
It was the Gators’ fourth straight loss 
in Knoxville and their sixth out of the last seven to the Volunteers. 
Tennessee (13-7, 4-2 SEC) opened the 
game with an 11-3 run and never took its 
foot off the gas.
UF guard Nick Calathes (21 points) 
was sent to the bench after picking up two 
fouls in the first three minutes of play. 
The first foul came at the 18:22 mark 
and the second a little more than a minute later when he was called for an offensive 
foul while driving down the lane.
“I didn’t think it was a charge, but the 
refs are going to make those calls some-
times,” Calathes said. 
Freshman Erving Walker was forced to 
shoulder the load at point guard for the Gators.
The burden was too much for him to 
handle.
Walker was clearly rattled by the rau-
cous Tennessee crowd and struggled to control the ball. 
Usually quick to pull the trigger, 
Walker (3 points) passed up open looks 
he usually knocks down.
With Calathes on the sideline, it was 
up to the 5-foot-8 Walker to slow down 6-foot-7 Tennessee guard Scotty Hopson.
The freshman capitalized on the mis-
match, scoring 20 points and going 4 of 6 
from 3-point range.
Calathes re-entered the game with a 
little more than six minutes to play in the first half, but by then the Volunteers al-ready had the game well in hand.
“Obviously, when we lose Nick, that’s 
a big part of our offense,” Parsons said. 
“We have to learn how to play without 
him.”
Frustration soon began to set in for the 
Gators.
Down 36-19 with 1:02 left in the first 
half, UF was charged with a five-second violation after the team failed to inbound 
the ball.

Keep your fingers crossed that

Because when he does, I can’t see 
why any talented recruit would rather play for the UF basketball team than Tennessee.
This weekend was my first trip to 
Rocky Top for a basketball game, and I couldn’t have been more impressed by the atmosphere in Thompson-Boling Arena. 
A crowd of just less than 21,000 
watched the Volunteers whoop up on the Gators 79-63, and though UF has the advantage in terms of trophies lately, Tennessee’s program is built on a much s t r o n g e r foundation.

KNOXVILLE, Tenn. — Rocky Top was 
rocking Saturday night, and Volunteers 
fans have Tyler Smith to thank.
The Tennessee junior forward was all 
over the court in the first half against UF, knocking down three 3-pointers and slam-ming home a mammoth alley-oop dunk with 5:25 left in the half.
As soon as Smith’s feet touched the 
ground after the dunk, he posed for the home crowd, hands on his hips, trium-phant. The fans ate it up.
“The crowd has been there for us 
through the losses,” Smith said. “We just wanted to pay them back for coming out and giving us some support.”
The sharpshooter finished the half with 
11 points, four rebounds and three assists.Two of Smith’s first-half 3-pointers 
came immediately on the heels of long-range baskets from the Gators, effectively silencing what could have become UF ral-
lies.
After the game, UF 
players were keenly 
aware of Smith’s impact 
on the game.
“Tyler Smith, he’s a 
warrior,” said UF for-
ward Chandler Parsons, who matched up against 
Smith for much of the game. “He’s one of the toughest players that I’ve played against.”
Smith began the Volunteers’ scoring 
with a 3-pointer from the left side immedi-ately after UF guard Nick Calathes missed a layup following the opening tip. That Smith puts on show for fans

With seven regular-season 
games, postseason tournaments 
and more than a month of bas-
ketball remaining, UF decided to 
go ahead and exceed its win to-tal from last season on Sunday at Arkansas.
Like last year, the No. 12 
Gators (20-2, 6-1 Southeastern Conference) didn’t have much trouble in Fayetteville, Ark., downing the Razorbacks (12-10, 
1-6 SEC) 94-78 to remain tied atop 
the SEC standings at the halfway point in the conference season.
However, unlike last year’s 
win, which gave UF its 13th vic-tory of the season, the Gators reached the 20-win mark for the first time since 2006, becoming just the 10th UF team to do so.
“We’ll take it,” UF coach 
Amanda Butler said. 
“I hope that we’re going to 
continue to find ways to get bet-
ter and continue to play consis-
tently at a high level.”
For a little perspective, the ’06 
UF squad advanced to the NCAA Tournament but didn’t pick up 
its 20th win until the last game of 
the regular season on Feb. 26.Reaching the mark may not be 
a big surprise for this team, but how quickly it came is a good indication of how far the Gators 
have come from a year ago.
Dominating Arkansas shed a 
little light on UF’s speedy success 
as well.
Sha Brooks scored 9 points in 
the first five minutes of the game to spark the Gators, who led by as many as 15 before the break. 
The senior 
finished  
with 25 points and 10 assists.
“What  
can you say about Sha B r o o k s ? ” 
Butler said. 
“She just raises her level when 
we need the level to be raised.”
UF relied on the 3-point shot 
early and often, and it worked.
The Gators set a new school 
record with 13 threes from five different players, breaking the previous mark of 11.
“When you’re on the road, you 
never expect that that’s going to happen,” Butler said. “That’s not what you want to count on, but when it does, you’ve got a chance 
to beat someone on their home floor.”
UF finished 13 of 21 for 62 per-
cent from beyond the arc.
“It seemed like the threes 
were so timely, too,” Butler said. 
“When we would have a little scoring drought or they would cut into our lead, one of our 
shooters would step up and hit.”
UF continued to get quality 
production from its bench.
Junior guard Lonnika 
Thompson matched starter Marshae Dotson’s 16 points. 
She gave UF the energy it 
needed in the second half and 
was the biggest contributor to the 
Gators’ 30 bench points.
“It is a lot of fun to watch,” 
Butler said of UF’s depth. 
“That also is one of the things 
that makes this team very hard to prepare for.”
The Gators had a field day 
sharing the ball as well. UF tal-
lied 19 assists.
“Our shooters finished those 
shots today for whoever passed them the ball,” Butler said. “It was not one of our best transition ballgames. 
“So those assists came from 
players finishing plays in the half court.”

In doubles action, they are dominant. In singles com-
petition, they are stellar.
Juniors Megan Alexander and Marrit Boonstra contin-
ued their exceptional play for the No. 7 Gators women in 
their 7-0 sweep of Western Michigan on Sunday.
The No. 18-ranked duo defeated the Broncos’ Emily 
Dudzik and Yumi Matsuto 8-2.
 They have only dropped four of their 36 games played 
as a pair this season for UF (4-0).
In singles, the 5-foot-11 Boonstra 
faced a near mirror image of herself, in 
appearance if not skill. The No. 34 player 
beat Kerstin Pahl 6-4, 6-1.
“It doesn’t happen a lot of times that 
someone is taller than me,” she said of her 6-foot-1 opponent. 
“I liked her game. She tried to go to 
the net often. I like when people do that.”
Alexander had equal success against Western 
Michigan’s Jenny Nalepa.
After a 3-3 score in the first set, Alexander rattled off 
nine straight games, rarely making a mistake.
“I made her play a lot of balls at the beginning,” 
Alexander said. 
“She hung with me for the first little bit and after a 
while got tired of it and started making more errors.”Doubles duo keeps

Members of the UF gymnastics team said they 
trained harder than ever last week in practice.
Amid a sea of pink, the team’s effort showed in 
Friday night’s Link to Pink meet against Kentucky 
(1-3, 0-3 Southeastern Conference).
Fueled by Melanie Sinclair’s perfect 10 on un-
even bars, the Gators (3-1, 2-1 SEC) rebounded from 
their Jan. 23 loss at Arkansas with a 195.925 to 193.85 
win.
The team led after the first event — vault — and 
practically put away the Wildcats on bars. 
Sinclair’s 10, sandwiched between 9.9s from team-
mates Maranda Smith and Corey Hartung, gave the Gators a comfortable lead.
“Actually, I woke up this morning, and I honestly 
felt, like, so good that I could do anything,” Sinclair 
said. “When I was warming up bars, everything just 
came so fluid.”
UF coach Rhonda Faehn had a good feeling about 
Sinclair before the meet even started.
“Her warm-up — I said, ‘That’s 10.0 material right 
there,,” Faehn said.
The 10 was Sinclair’s third career 10. Her first 
came against the same foe, Kentucky, on Feb. 16, 2007.
The whole team performed well on bars, with no 
gymnast scoring lower than a 9.8.
The team’s success didn’t carry over to balance 
beam. For the third straight week, beam proved to 
be UF’s weakest event. The team turned in a 48.125.
“We just keep having stupid mistakes on the 
beam,” Hartung said. “One bad beam rotation is fine, but not two — like (Friday). Having a second 
one (Friday) is unacceptable.”
Following the 10, Sinclair led off on beam. Hyped 
up from her perfect score, she faltered a bit on the 
dismount.“I was really antsy going into beam,” she said. “I 
was shaking after my 10 so it was hard — I was first 
on beam — so it was hard to bring my heart rate back 
down and get grounded so I can do my beam rou-
tine. I was still a little anxious on my dismount.”
Faehn attributed the continuing beam troubles to 
injuries.
“We have, still, injured athletes,” she said. “We’ve 
had a different lineup every week on beam and 
we’ve had a different order, and it’s just because we 
haven’t been able to have the athletes consistently healthy to be able to go in.”
Sinclair said there was improvement on beam, 
though, and statistically there was.
“Going aggressive and making mistakes is better, 
and that’s just the next step to hitting your routines perfect,” she said. 
Hartung, who fell off beam last week against 
Arkansas, showed why the fall was uncharacteristic. 
Against Kentucky, she scored a 9.9 on beam, good 
for the beam title.
“I’ll take the 9.9 for tonight, but I know I can score 
better,” Hartung said.
Despite troubles on beam, it wasn’t enough for 
the Gators to relinquish the lead on floor exercise, though it was enough for the team to lose some of 
the swagger it had before beam.
The team scored a 49.05 on floor, its lowest output 
in the event this season.
“I think that carried over a little bit into floor,” 
Faehn said. “They lost that energy and that momen-
tum and so we lost some tenths on floor as well.”Sinclair’s 10 fuels Gators’ victoryWomen's

shot from downtown brought the 
fans to their feet, and few would sit down the rest of the evening. The momentum belonged to the players in orange and white from that point forward.
Calathes said Smith’s shoot-
ing efficiency caught the Gators off guard. Smith had made just 10 of 40 threes all season coming into the game.
“He made his threes tonight, 
which we didn’t think he would make them,” Calathes said. “We weren’t expecting those.”
That he was underestimated 
by UF didn’t shock Smith at all.
“The percentages aren’t show-
ing how hard I’ve been work-ing,” he said.
Smith had been slumping 
lately, but Saturday night’s ef-fort reinforced his coach’s belief in him.
“Tyler Smith can shoot the 
ball,” Tennessee coach Bruce Pearl said. “He shot with confi-dence.  You have to deserve vic-tory, and you have to believe as a shooter that the shot deserves to go in.”Smith quieted down a bit 
in the second half but left Thompson-Boling Arena after he scored 16 points, tied for a team high in rebounds with nine and gathered four assists.
He hit three free throws down 
the stretch to end any thoughts of a UF comeback, and Parsons fouled out while landing on him when Smith got a rebound. Parsons, exasperated with the night’s performance, put his arms in the air as if to say, “What more can I do?”
While Parsons trudged off 
the court, Smith stood still and played to the crowd by waving his arms in the air.
The game fittingly ended with 
the ball in Smith’s hands. As the clock wound down, he dribbled the last seconds away. As the buzzer sounded, he ceremoni-ously dunked the ball, putting a cap on the Volunteers’ huge vic-tory.
Smith said he wanted to dunk 
the ball before time expired.
“I wanted the 2 points,” Smith 
said with a laugh. “But Coach said no, we couldn’t shoot. So I let the time expire so I wouldn’t be in trouble.”

Parsons fouled out with 
1:28 to play after tallying 15 points and nine rebounds.
At times Saturday night, 
the game became heated, with 
physical altercations popping 
up across the court.
Walter Hodge was charged 
with a technical foul with 15:39 to play in the second half.

physical in final tickswith four video boards and four statscreens.
Sure, those are just creature comforts, but 
they make Thompson-Boling a premier place 
for basketball.
Second, Tennessee fans are just better 
than the ones I see at the O’Dome. Granted, I caught them on a good night — ESPN’s 
College GameDay was in attendance — but 
the Volunteers’ faithful blow Gators’ sup-
porters out of the water. 
The most noticeable difference between 
the two crowds is the connection the players and fans share at Tennessee. The Volunteers 
play a totally different style from the Gators, 
and a lot of it comes from the energy in the arena.
Tennessee players took the court on 
Saturday by jogging through the student sec-
tion, and the students repaid the love with an explosion of sound for the opening minutes, when the Volunteers jumped out to a quick 
lead.
“I promise you the environment had a 
lot to do with us getting off to a pretty good 
start,” Tennessee coach Bruce Pearl said.
When J.P. Prince threw down a dunk to 
make the score 11-3, he stood on the baseline 
and offered an overdone salute to the crowd, 
and the Volunteers were celebrating and dancing all over the court after their early 
buckets. 
That kind of swagger has been missing 
from Gainesville since the ’04s left, but that doesn’t just come from players. Even when 
Tennessee doesn’t have a great team — this 
year included — its fans can lift it up.
That doesn’t happen at UF, where the 
closest things fans can come up with to being original are a lame “Fantastic” cheer (one of 
the dumbest things I’ve heard at a sporting 
event) and a guy pretending a piece of string is an instrument.
Volunteers fans are even superior during 
opposing free throws. They do it right, not by screaming and shaking pom-poms, but by 
waving their arms in unison to one side, and then swinging their arms to the other side as 
the player releases his shot.
That’s how it’s supposed to be done. It 
actually makes a difference, and it’s another 
reason why Tennessee hoops games are a main course of their own, not just an appe-
tizer before spring football starts up.
Maybe hearing that the basketball experi-
ence is better and more fun at Tennessee will make you mad. 
That’s fine, but it’s true, and it’s unlikely 
to change anytime soon.
The best part is, you don’t have to do any-
thing about it. Donovan will find a way to keep the Gators relevant, and when they’re 
lagging, you can always count on Urban 
Meyer.
